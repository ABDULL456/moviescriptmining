I 
PETULIA I'm fine. 
DAVID ... for a split second there 
PETULIA Ism okay. 
DAVID I thought maybe you 
PETULIA David. Somehow or other we begin to sense that madness has entered what is really a commonplace scene. Something has gone wrong and we can't for the life of us under- stand what and before we can even guess, we are: 
27 INT. BUS 
Petulia is still in the bus and we realize she has 0 imagined the foregoing. She gets off the bus. 
28 EXT. THE VERY. MODEST OFFICES OF THE "FRIENDS OF THE 
EVERGREEN" DAY. The sign on the door identifies this as a fraternal organization, founded in 1886 for the betterment of man, but the door is securely padlocked for the night. Archie stands there, holding the tuba and feeling stupid. Haplessly, he returns to his car and begins stowing the tuba inside, banging it against his nose in the process. He is a far from happy man. 
29 EXT./INT. A CLUTTERED, MEAN LITTLE KITCIEN 
IN A SLUM HOUSE DAY Petulia is filling the noisy old electric ice box with milk, ice cream and fresh fruit. A man enters from another room. He is a big, sleepy-eyed Mexican. He has just awakened, is wearing his pajama bottoms and is hairy, sweaty and fat. Petulia obviously knows tlleiman, nods hello, to which the man answers a non-committal grunt. He squeezes past Petulia to drink from the sink. He sticks his head under the tap. 
PETULIA (she speaks slowly because he doesn't understand English) I came by to make sure there was enough milk and things. He finds the situation amusing, reaching in past Petulia to grab an orange. There should be a feeling of a possible relationship between Petulia and this man. In the next room a screen door opens and closes. Petulia closes the ice box door and we and she see Oliver and the Woman standing in the doorway. 
30 INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT NIGHT 
Archie is doing research at a desk. Working from notes, he is talking into a tape recorder about new techniques in the treatment of arthritis that would not require surgery. This is a moment to glimpse Archie as a thoughtful man. There are a couple of beer bottles nearby. The bed is still unmade. The tuba stands in the corner. 
The front doorbell rings and Archie crosses over to let in his wife, Polo, a very attractive young matron. 
30 CONTINUED Polo looks about the apartment dubiously, from tuba to unmade bed. She can't keep her eyes off the unmade bed. 
ARCHIE (after `awhile ) Hi, Polo. 
POLO It's very nice. Archie looks at her questioningly. 
POLO I've never been here before. It's very nice. 
ARCHIE Thanks. 
POLO It's strange, coming into your husband's bachelor apartment for the first time. Feels slightly illegal. Is that a tuba? 
ARCHIE That's a tuba. 
POLO Make a marvelous lamp. 
ARCHIE You just had to say it. 
POLO Predictable Polo. 
ARCHIE "Predictable Polo." Has a certain zing. How're the kids? 
POLO Looking forward to the weekend. Lest I forget She opens her large handbag, takes out a cellophane bag of cookies. 
POLO As usual, I baked enough for an army. 
ARCHIE Okay.

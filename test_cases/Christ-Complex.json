{"test1_input": "QUINN Did you? \nZOEY Enjoy myself? Of course. \nQUINN Based on how you are acting this morning I have my doubts. That's not what I meant though. You woke up screaming. \nZOEY It was nothing. \nQUINN I understand if you don't want to talk about it. I'm just concerned. \nZOEY It's not a big deal. It was...a...well wouldn't call it a nightmare...repressed memory. Hell, it's not repressed...I think of it all the time. \nQUINN What is it? \nZOEY You don't want to hear about it. \nQuinn touches her hand. \nQUINN Please? \nZoey takes a deep breath. \nZOEY My father, I mentioned him before, was a Baptist minister. He always said he had this \"sickness\". He begged my mom for help, it was more important though for her to having shopping and dinner dates with her girlfriends. Anna, my friend that \"loves you\", has been in my life since I was tiny. She used to come over all the time. My Dad adored her. When I was around twelve I found something in the closet...tapes. My Dad and Anna from the time she was like seven...He... (starts tearing up) I showed my Mom, and Dad...well he got out of prison when I was seventeen. I don't see him anymore. His church, even though they knew he had a problem disowned him. He wouldn't have done that to Anna if my mom would have supported him, got him help. \nQUINN Who do you think is to blame? \nZOEY He tried to get help Quinn, he reached out to my Mom. I should have protected Anna too...I mean- \nQUINN -None of this was your fault. \nZOEY I have to protect people. This was out of my control, you Quinn...What's going on with you...I have control of that. \nQuinn looks at Zoey. He loves her, but a part of him pities her too. \nEXT. PARK-RIVERSIDE-LATER \nZoey is curled up under Quinn's arm as they sit on the same bench from earlier. Quinn stares out toward the river. It's obvious he is pondering over his choices. \nQUINN I love being with you. \nZOEY Me too. \nQUINN I can't renege on my responsibilities with Louis though. Zoey sits up. \nZOEY You're not actually going to fight your friend to the death are you? \nQUINN I know you don't understand this. We just need to make the most of our time. \nZOEY Quinn, in 2 days things are going to be normal. This is just a delusion. \nQUINN I know you don't understand. I just need to go see Louis today. \nZOEY I understand that. \n", "test1_true": "QUINN'S POV \nQuinn sees Ryan Blood hiding behind a tree. He is taking video of Quinn and Zoey with a \"smart phone\". \nPARK-RIVERSIDE \nQuinn jolts up. Zoey is alarmed. \nZOEY What is it? \nQuinn doesn't answer. He gets up and runs to the... \nTREE \nQuinn looks behind the tree, but Ryan is long gone. Zoey comes up from behind, she places her hand on Quinn's shoulder. \nZOEY What was wrong? \nQUINN My neighbor Ryan Blood...looks like he's spying on me. \nZOEY What are you talking about? \nQUINN I need to go see Louis. \nINT. RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT-LATER \nLouis is watching the video on the smart phone. He's seen enough, he throws it back to Ryan. \nLouis tosses trash off the couch so he can sit down. \nLOUIS (sitting down) I thought him admitting his true self would break them up- \nRyan plops down in his computer desk chair. \nRYAN BLOOD -Instead he is still hot and heavy with her. (beat) He even did the \"bipty boom\" last night. \nLOUIS The fight is pointless. \nRYAN BLOOD It's not pointless. The game has just changed is all. (beat) We have two levels here: one is making sure we keep him engaged. (beat) Honestly though that's an afterthought at this point- \nLOUIS So what's the next move? \nRyan reaches into his desk drawer. \nRYAN BLOOD (still searching) Well when he does become engaged... \nRyan throws something at Louis. \nLOUIS POV \nLouis catches the item. He looks down to see a nine millimeter. RYAN BLOOD (O.S.) (CONT'D) ...We need to make sure you still have the advantage. \n", "test1_id": 1137, "test2_input": "INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-LATER \nZoey is pacing back and forth. Jack rubs his face in frustration. He is tired of watching Zoey tear herself up over this guy. \nAnna tries to step into Zoey's path attempting to get her attention \nANNA What are you doing? \nZoey is jittery, she can't handle Anna blocking her way. \nZOEY I haven't heard from Quinn since he wigged out today. \nANNA Well honestly maybe that's a good thing. \nZOEY He needs me. \nANNA He doesn't need you! Not everyone needs you! \nZOEY (frustrated) This isn't about me and you- \nANNA -This is about me and you! You think you can make up for what happened. The fact you didn't notice, couldn't save me in time. You were a child! I was a child! You couldn't have saved your father either! Your mother couldn't have, no one could have! He was a fucking pedophile! \nZoey slaps Anna across the face. \nANNA (CONT'D) Hate me all you want, but it's impossible to redeem yourself for things you had no control over. Jack is sick and tired of this display. \nJACK Just show her the fucking file. \nJack gets up. \nZOEY (confused) What fucking file? \nEXT. LOUIS APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS \nQuinn runs toward Louis' apartment. His KNOCKS sound like a jackhammer on the door. \nLouis answers. \nQUINN We have a problem. \nLOUIS You're right. We do. \nLouis moves slightly and we see Ryan Blood in the background. \nLouis slowly closes the door in a stunned Quinn's face. \nINT. LOUIS APARTMENT \nLouis turns toward Ryan. \nLOUIS I thought coming here would give us some privacy from Quinn. \nRYAN BLOOD I think it worked out perfectly. \n", "test2_true": "Jack walks into the room holding a file folder. Zoey is sitting on the couch trying to get a grip. \nJack throws the file in her lap. \nZOEY So is the file folder for dramatic effect? \nJACK No it was to keep everything organized... (beat) ...and for dramatic effect. \nSuddenly Zoey's cell phon rings. \nShe sets the folder aside and answers. \nZOEY Quinn? \nINTERCUT \nEXT. STREET CORNER \nQuinn is on a pay phone, he's shaking. At this point he is lost on what his next move should be. \nQUINN Ryan Blood! \nZOEY You mentioned that earlier. What is going on? \nQUINN He's with Louis. They're planning to kill me. \nZOEY I thought that was the whole plan. \nQUINN No it's...this isn't like Louis. I think he is trying to cheat his way to a win. \nZOEY Why don't you come over here. \nQUINN I can't! \nZOEY Come on Quinn get a grip. Just calm down and come over here. \nQUINN You're right. \nZOEY OK so just come on over and we'll talk. \nQUINN No I mean you're right. I need to get control of myself. I have a destiny. I need to figure out my next move. \nZOEY Quinn? No wait- \nQuinn hangs up the phone. \nZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT \nZoey slowly drops her cell phone to the floor.

RHODES You have to calm down and meditate. \nZOEY Um...no...listen do you know Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks? They grew up here. \nMrs. Rhodes steps back like a vampire who has just seen a cross. \nMRS. RHODES No...You need to leave! \nZOEY What? \nMRS. RHODES And give me your shirt. \nZOEY Um...no. \nZoey turns around and starts to leave. Mrs. Rhodes starts screaming at the top of her lungs. \nMRS. RHODES You better make your peace with God girl! The end is coming, those boys are ushering in a new era! \nZoey runs down the hallway toward the front door. \nEXT. ORPHANAGE \nZoey runs outside and makes it to her car. She hits the roof of her vehicle in anger \nZOEY What a fucking nut house! \nJAKE (O.S.) (monotone) Excuse me! \nZoey jumps up and screams. She sees Jake standing creepily behind her. \nZOEY What! \nJAKE (monotone) I know the young boys you speak of. \nZOEY (doesn't care) And? \nJAKE (monotone) I was here when Quinn got sent to the mental hospital. It was like the other one set it up. \nZOEY Wait Louis? You think Louis made Quinn appear crazy? \nJAKE (monotone) They both believed the same thing. Louis was just smart enough to hide it. \nZOEY There is more to it than that. \nJAKE (monotone) I don't understand \nZOEY Listen \"Robot Boy\", where did this whole belief come from? This isn't something two kids come up with on their own. \nJAKE (monotone) Yes I believe a seed was planted. \nZOEY Exactly. I heard there was an employee that got fired for sharing Mormon mythology with the boys. \nJAKE (monotone) No. Off base. He's not the right one. \n", "test3_true": "INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT- A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nJack sits at the PC while chatting away on his cell phone. It appears he is looking up information for who ever is on the other end. \nINT.ZOEY'S CAR- CONTINUOUS \nZoey is parked in a parking lot, while she chats on her cell phone with Jack. \nJACK You might be right sweetheart. The employee I was telling you about earlier was instrumental in getting Appleridge Orphanage shut down. \nZOEY How? \nJACK Mrs. Rhodes was pretty well known in Huntington. I think she felt this guy was getting in the way of her master plan. Finally, nearly 20 years later, he convinced the state what was really going on there. \nZOEY Well...elaborate. \nJACK That girl you talked to was \"pants crapping nuts\". She actually makes your boyfriend look sane. I guess she believes that Lucifer came to her in a vision- \nZOEY -How is that different than a dream? Just saying- \nJACK -I don't know. I think you have to be awake for a vision. (beat) Will you please pay attention? Anyway he, meaning Lucifer, gave her this jazz about...well you know the story. Two angels, fighting to the death...blah...blah...Anyway he told her she needed to look after Louis and get Quinn out of there. I guess trying to stack the odds in Louis' favor. \nZOEY So she had Quinn committed? JACK To the same hospital where her nephew was a patient. All on the dark lord's orders I guess. \nZOEY Fucking Ryan Blood! \nJACK Your friends are fucking whack. \nZOEY Thanks Jack. \nJACK So what are you going to do? \nZOEY I'm going to stop an Apocalyptic battle. \nJACK Goddamn Zoey! \nZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT \nJack realizes Zoey hung up on him. He slowly puts his phone down and steps away from the computer. \nHe walks over to the couch and sits down. He lets out a sigh of exhaustion as he leans back on the couch. \nZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-A FEW HOURS LATER \nJack is now sprawled out on the couch. Anna walks in the room and sets a beverage on the coffee table in front of him. \nShe moves his legs and sits down beside of him. \nANNA So where is she at now? \nJack sits up. \n", "test3_id": 1139}

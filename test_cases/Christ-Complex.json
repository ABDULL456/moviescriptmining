{"train": "CHRIST COMPLEX \nWritten by \nJeffrey Scott Richards \nFADE IN: \nCLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S LEG \nA nervous leg shakes under the table. The appendage seems to be attached to someone who has a lot on their mind. \nINT. CAFE-DAY \nLOUIS, a college student in his late twenties stares at a friend who is sitting off screen. Louis is calm, almost villainous in how collective he is. \nHe stares at this unseen friend, trying to assess the cause for his anxious state. \nLOUIS (smug) Something is bothering you... \nWe finally see QUINN, also in his late twenties. He is obviously uneasy about being out in public with this person. \nQUINN I appreciate the faux concern but I'm fine. \nLouis is taken aback. \nLOUIS My concern is genuine... \nQUINN With our history can you honestly say you care about my well being? \nLOUIS Yes I can, our connection is a product of destiny. I have no ill-will against you. \nQuinn scoffs. \nQUINN \nLOUIS -The Stephen Speilberg film? \nQUINN No, there was that little French girl I liked. You..you violated her and torched her farm killing her family- \nLOUIS -Actually you are jacking up the story, I violated her father in front of her...then I torched the farm. \nQUINN Well...that makes it ten times better. \nLOUIS Quinn that was war, people do crazy things midst of wide spread conflict. I have gotten jaded over time. It's not like the dark ages when I had style. \nQUINN When you would rape the horses and ride away on the women? \nLOUIS Yeah I was such a ham. (beat) Quinn, this is what we do. I have gotten carried away in the past, but now I'm tired. I just want to get this over with. It's our calling, we help bring order and balance to the universe. (beat) Maybe I would feel less removed if you would let me win just once. \nQUINN This isn't a 1930's boxing match. If I take dive, I'm not lining the pockets of some bookie...I'm bringing on the apocalypse. Louis takes a drink of his coffee. \nLOUIS See at least our obligation would be over. \nRICK Oh well...so do you want to see what I'm doing on the computer? \nZoey feels like she has broken down the \"wall\". \nZOEY Yes...of course! \nRick spins the computer around. \nRICK Check that out Lloyd Dobler. \nZOEY (Shocked) Is that...porn? \nRICK Red Tube...like You Tube...but with porn. \nZOEY Um.... (lightbulb) wait...is that? \nRICK Oh yes... \nZOEY Us having sex? \nRICK Oh yeah... \nRick reaches over and points at the laptop screen. \nRICK (CONT'D) I love the part coming up. (beat) You know where I put your legs behind your head and yell \"hump bunny!\" \nZOEY Yeah...um...I'm not OK with this... RICK Yeah...OK...I'm also breaking up with you. \nZOEY What?- \nRICK -Yeah not working any more for me- \nZOEY What the hell?!? How is it not working?!? \nRICK You are yelling...you know I don't like confrontational situations. \nZOEY I'm not trying to be confrontational...I just...you are breaking up with me? \nRICK -Yeah...Can I have my laptop back now? \nZoey, still confused, slowly turns the laptop back toward Rick. \nRICK (CONT'D) (looking at the screen) This part is fucking priceless. \nZoey is bewildered. \nEXT. PARK-AFTERNOON \nLouis kicks at the ground, almost as if he was searching for something. His foot finally rests on a broken tree limb. \nHe places his foot under it and kicks it up to his right hand. \nLOUIS This will do. \nThe boy is now doing the same to Zoey. \nANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D) -This put you right in the cross-hairs to be his next victim. \nZOEY 13 YEARS OLD \nZACK, a young teenager is selling drugs on the street corner. His bags of coke should be exaggerated, as well as the customers coming up to buy from him. Think if South Park was crossed with HBO's The Wire. \nANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Good old Zack the neighbourhood drug dealer- Zoey takes Zack into a room labeled \"Rehab\" on the door. \nANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D) -You took it upon yourself to be his personal savoir. What did it get you? \nZack is out with Zoey when a few of his old GANG FRIENDS show up looking to collect. Zack opens his pockets to show he doesn't have any dough on him. \nANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Well when Zach's old business partners wanted to collect on a debt- \nZack slowly pushes Zoey toward them. \nA few days later we see Zoey being used as a human coffee table as the gang uses her back to cut cocaine. \nANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D) - they used you to replace their missing coffee table they broke during a drunken party. \nZOEY 17 YEARS OLD. \nA gang member looks directly into the camera. He smiles showing his golden grille. \nANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D) -And then you have Toothpick. What kind of name is Toothpick? \nZOEY (V.O.) It was his gang name. \nANNA (V.O.) Of course. \nIt's prom night and Toothpick is in his \"pimp\" tux. He takes a swig of his \"40\" while he dances with Zoey. \nANNA (CONT'D) We won't talk about prom night. Needless to say it wasn't romantic. \nToothpick and Zoey are in an hotel room. Toothpick is standing over Zoey, who is facedown on the bed. It appears he is urinating on her. It's hard to tell with the black censor bar. \nEND SEQUENCE BACK TO: \nPARK-RIVERSIDE-PRESENT DAY \nZOEY Exaggerations- \nANNA -Accurate account of events... The story of your romantic life- \nZOEY -Unfair. Because these people need someone who is going to sacrifice their own needs for them. \nANNA Why? \nZOEY Who else is going to do it? We're alone in the universe. If we are going to make it through this \"crazy world\" we need to look out for each other. \nANNA I think you use atheism and the whole \"we are alone in the universe\" jive to justify your actions. (beat) I regret taking you to see Dawkins because you use that as a fall back to be codependent. \nCLOSE UP-HAND \nAs her hand opens a class ring was digging into her palm. It appears this might have belonged to Rick. \nPARK-RIVERSIDE \nStill teary eyed, Zoey angrily throws the ring toward the river. A gust of wind causes the ring to curve and it slams into the temple of a man sitting on a park bench. \nZoey walks over to apologize and meets Quinn for the first time. \nZOEY (making her way to the bench) I'm so sorry Quinn rubs his temple and then reaches down to pick up the ring. \nQUINN (handing the ring back to her) Is this yours? \nShe takes the ring and shoves it into her pocket. \nZOEY Kinda... Again I'm so sorry. \nQUINN No need to apologize. \nQuinn scoots over and motions for her to sit. \nQUINN (CONT'D) Do you want to sit? \nZOEY (unsure) OK? \nZoey sits, still apprehensive. \nZOEY (CONT'D) (reaching her hand out) I'm Zoey. \nQUINN (He returns the gesture) Quinn. (beat) Zoey? Interesting. \nZOEY Oh name? Yes, most people have interesting stories behind their names...Honestly I have nothing. Not sure why my parents did that. \nQUINN Very unique. \nZOEY (smiles) I suppose that's a compliment. So I've seen you around school, but never really...in...class... \nQUINN I don't go to Marshall, I live near the campus though. \nZOEY Oh, well so what do you do? \nQUINN As in profession? I don't really have one. \nZOEY Really? Rent is insane around here... \nQUINN Yeah, my father provides for me. \nZOEY That's pretty cool. What's he into? \nQUINN Everything. \nZOEY An entrepreneur...That's awesome. (beat) Well...So do you like coming down here? \nQUINN (laughs) What? \nZOEY Have you thought about St John's Wort? \nQUINN You are a very cryptic speaker. ZOEY No I'm thinking out loud mostly. I was just...well...you have some social awkwardness. \nQUINN OK? \nZOEY Well you are latching on to religion to make you feel whole. It doesn't make you feel whole, or at least as whole as you thought it would- \nQUINN You are kind of right on that one. \nZOEY So you are out with me...I represent everything you were brought up to combat. You're missing something and you are looking for help. \nQUINN I am looking for help. I'm out with you though because I'm interested in getting to know you. \nZOEY (smiles) See I'm good at reading people. \nQUINN (rolls eyes, smiles) Kind of. \nZOEY I don't know Quinn you seem like a lost soul. I thought that when I saw you by the river. \nQUINN You like lost souls don't you? \nZOEY Yeah I actually do. Someone needs to save them. \nQUINN You going to save me? \nZOEY If you let me. QUINN I think you might be able to. \nZOEY (endearing smile) So what do you need Quinn? \nQUINN (smiles) Dessert. \nINT.   ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-LATER \nJack is passed out drooling on the couch. Anna and Zoey are cross legged on the floor in the midst of \"girl talk\". \nANNA I don't know, he seems fishy. \nZOEY He seems harmless. \nANNA I have heard that a million times. \nZOEY I know. He's in the ministry- \nANNA -and you hate organized religion. \nZOEY I know and he's understanding of that. \nANNA Plus it's to my understanding he didn't actually admit what he did. He just did a bunch of double talk. \nZOEY It was understood. \nZOEY This might be a little hard-core for your first film. \nQUINN No it's OK. I'm excited. \nZoey shakes her head. \nZOEY I feel like I'm stealing your virginity here. \nZoey slowly looks over at Quinn. \nZOEY (CONT'D) You're a virgin too aren't you? \nQuinn shrugs \nZOEY (CONT'D) Oh my god! I'm a bad girl. \nQuinn puts his hand on her shoulder. \nQUINN (smiles) You are not. \nQuinn motions to the TV. \nQUINN (CONT'D) Please play the film. \nZOEY (hesitant) OK? I mean I usually play this for potential boyfriends. If they can handle this, they can handle me. \nZoey hits play on the remote. \nZOEY (CONT'D) I guess you're lucky I thought about \"They Call Her One Eye\". (to herself) I hope this doesn't jack you up. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: 3 DAYS LEFT \nEXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY \nQuinn is sitting cross legged in the middle of the field. He seems as though he is in the middle of a trance. \nQUINN (monotone) I am curious Yellow... \nLouis walks up and throws a toy sword on Quinn's lap. \nLOUIS What the hell are you talking about? \nQuinn stands up and grabs the sword. \nQUINN Nothing really. \nThe two start to sword fight, but Quinn does not have his heart in it. \nLOUIS You half asleep Quinn? \nQuinn stops for a second and drops his sword down to his side. Louis pokes Quinn in the chest with the tip of his sword. \nHe walks up to a mirror and starts looking at himself. \nLOUIS' POV \nHe starts to run his hands through his hair. He tries to straighten up the mess on his head. He picks up some gel and squirts a small amount in his hand. \nHe runs it through his hair, getting the desired look. \nLOUIS (to himself) You are a handsome devil. \nLOUIS APARTMENT \nLouis spins around and grabs his keys off of the coffee table. He then dances right out the door. \nINT. QUINN'S ROOM-A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nLouis walks into Quinn's room and finds him not there. \nLOUIS (puzzled) Weird? \nLouis walks out into... \nHALLWAY \n...the hallway. Ryan Blood is standing in the doorway of his room, across the hall. \nRYAN BLOOD You looking for Quinn? \nTakes Louis' a second to register Ryan's question. \nLOUIS Yes? \nRYAN BLOOD (nodding toward the exit door) He just left. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING \nLouis runs outside. He looks up and down the street. In the distance he finally spots them, Quinn and Zoey holding hands. \nLOUIS (to himself) What do we have here? \nEXT. CAFE-MOMENTS LATER \nLouis stands across the street, staring right into the window of the cafe. He clearly sees Quinn and Zoey on a date. \nHis eyes widen as their hands touch. \nEXT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING-LATER \nZoey and Quinn walk holding hands through the apartment building parking lot. Zoey stops for a second and turns to face Quinn. \nZOEY Why haven't I seen your place? \nQUINN My place isn't very exciting. \nRyan leans back in his desk chair. Louis has cleared off a spot on a messy couch. \nThe apartment, simply put, is a \"shithole\" \nRYAN BLOOD You're here to learn more about his \"coming and goings\". To find out what I have seen. \nLOUIS So far you are dead on. \nRYAN BLOOD It's more than that Louis- \nLOUIS -You know who I am? RYAN BLOOD I know pretty much everything. I've watched you, studied you...I feel I'm expert on your little game every seventy years. \nLOUIS Really? \nRYAN BLOOD Oh yes. \nRyan picks up a stack of documents and throws the papers one at a time at Louis. \nRYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) You battled as mortals- (beat) (MORE) \nRYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) -You were a Lamanite then- (beat) -Quinn was a commander of the Nephites, last survivor of that nation- (beat) -The savoir spoke to him, showed him his future...his destiny- (beat) -See after the death of Christ there was some debate on what was going to bring on the end and signal his return- (beat) - It was decided two great warriors had to fight. The winner would determine the start of the apocalypse. Your boss of course needed someone to represent his interests. Who better than Quinn's old adversary? \nLouis brushes the pile of papers of his lap. \nLOUIS Where are you going with this you weird little man? \nRYAN BLOOD You had strategy in the beginning. Middle Ages...Old West...Even World War II. (beat) Let's take a step back for a second. The Old West. Lack of faith, corruption, these things make Quinn weak. The chink in his armor is his faith in people. You knew that, and corrupting America...a young land...was the key. (beat) Quinn was a step ahead of you, and looked for a human ally. That ally was Joseph Smith, and Quinn...or I mean Moroni...led Joseph to the plates that later when into- \nRyan picks a book up and throws it at Louis. Louis looks down at the \"Book Of Mormon\". \nRYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) -His little plan didn't work, but the book is a great coffee table discussion piece. This made him weak Louis. You could have destroyed him. The problem is you've allowed yourself to become fond of him. YOU need to embrace your destiny. \nLOUIS How do I do that? \nRYAN BLOOD This girl is distracting him. Get his mind focused on the matter at hand. At this point I'm afraid he isn't even going to fight you. \nLOUIS I'm surprised this girl even likes Quinn. He comes across creepy. \nRYAN BLOOD Maybe that's the key- \nLOUIS (lightbulb) -Make her think he's crazy. \nINT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER \nQuinn opens the door to his room and spies a silhouette in the far corner. \nLOUIS Where have you been? \nThe silhouette comes out of the darkness and into view. It should come to no surprise that Louis is emerging from the darkness. \nQUINN You've been waiting long? \nLOUIS No I figured you were on your way back- QUINN -because you are spying on me again? So I don't need to tell you where I've been. \nQUINN Did you? \nZOEY Enjoy myself? Of course. \nQUINN Based on how you are acting this morning I have my doubts. That's not what I meant though. You woke up screaming. \nZOEY It was nothing. \nQUINN I understand if you don't want to talk about it. I'm just concerned. \nZOEY It's not a big deal. It was...a...well wouldn't call it a nightmare...repressed memory. Hell, it's not repressed...I think of it all the time. \nQUINN What is it? \nZOEY You don't want to hear about it. \nQuinn touches her hand. \nQUINN Please? \nZoey takes a deep breath. \nZOEY My father, I mentioned him before, was a Baptist minister. He always said he had this \"sickness\". He begged my mom for help, it was more important though for her to having shopping and dinner dates with her girlfriends. Anna, my friend that \"loves you\", has been in my life since I was tiny. She used to come over all the time. My Dad adored her. When I was around twelve I found something in the closet...tapes. My Dad and Anna from the time she was like seven...He... (starts tearing up) I showed my Mom, and Dad...well he got out of prison when I was seventeen. I don't see him anymore. His church, even though they knew he had a problem disowned him. He wouldn't have done that to Anna if my mom would have supported him, got him help. \nQUINN Who do you think is to blame? \nZOEY He tried to get help Quinn, he reached out to my Mom. I should have protected Anna too...I mean- \nQUINN -None of this was your fault. \nZOEY I have to protect people. This was out of my control, you Quinn...What's going on with you...I have control of that. \nQuinn looks at Zoey. He loves her, but a part of him pities her too. \nEXT. PARK-RIVERSIDE-LATER \nZoey is curled up under Quinn's arm as they sit on the same bench from earlier. Quinn stares out toward the river. It's obvious he is pondering over his choices. \nQUINN I love being with you. \nZOEY Me too. \nQUINN I can't renege on my responsibilities with Louis though. Zoey sits up. \nZOEY You're not actually going to fight your friend to the death are you? \nQUINN I know you don't understand this. We just need to make the most of our time. \nZOEY Quinn, in 2 days things are going to be normal. This is just a delusion. \nQUINN I know you don't understand. I just need to go see Louis today. \nZOEY I understand that. \nINT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-LATER \nZoey is pacing back and forth. Jack rubs his face in frustration. He is tired of watching Zoey tear herself up over this guy. \nAnna tries to step into Zoey's path attempting to get her attention \nANNA What are you doing? \nZoey is jittery, she can't handle Anna blocking her way. \nZOEY I haven't heard from Quinn since he wigged out today. \nANNA Well honestly maybe that's a good thing. \nZOEY He needs me. \nANNA He doesn't need you! Not everyone needs you! \nZOEY (frustrated) This isn't about me and you- \nANNA -This is about me and you! You think you can make up for what happened. The fact you didn't notice, couldn't save me in time. You were a child! I was a child! You couldn't have saved your father either! Your mother couldn't have, no one could have! He was a fucking pedophile! \nZoey slaps Anna across the face. \nANNA (CONT'D) Hate me all you want, but it's impossible to redeem yourself for things you had no control over. Jack is sick and tired of this display. \nJACK Just show her the fucking file. \nJack gets up. \nZOEY (confused) What fucking file? \nEXT. LOUIS APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS \nQuinn runs toward Louis' apartment. His KNOCKS sound like a jackhammer on the door. \nLouis answers. \nQUINN We have a problem. \nLOUIS You're right. We do. \nLouis moves slightly and we see Ryan Blood in the background. \nLouis slowly closes the door in a stunned Quinn's face. \nINT. LOUIS APARTMENT \nLouis turns toward Ryan. \nLOUIS I thought coming here would give us some privacy from Quinn. \nRYAN BLOOD I think it worked out perfectly. \nZOEY I don't know. He's losing it. \nJack hands her the folder. \nJACK You need to look at this. \nZoey takes the folder from him and starts reading. \nJACK (CONT'D) I spent a lot of time gathering that information. \nZOEY So what is all this? \nJACK Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks were orphans. \nZoey is flipping through documents. \nJACK (CONT'D) Quinn displayed some erratic behavior from the beginning. One of the staff members was Mormon and they would read stories to Quinn out of the Book Of Mormon. That employee was later fired, but a seed was planted in Quinn's head. He kept going on about how he and Louis were meant to fight to the death. Some of the children at the time claim Louis would encourage this behavior. He probably thought this was Quinn's attempt at playing. (beat) As things continued the staff at the orphanage thought Quinn needed help beyond what they could offer. They sent Quinn to a hospital. \nZoey puts the folder down, the documents fall to the floor. \nZOEY You're not telling me anything I didn't already know. \nANNA That makes it worse. You're going to continue this now that you know for a fact that he is nuts? \nZOEY I'm too far into this now. I don't have a choice. \nZoey picks the documents up and places them in the folder. She then tosses the folder on the coffee table. \nJACK Why don't you let us save you? Please Zoey. \nZOEY Let me be guys. \nZoey walks to her bedroom, leaving Anna and Jack exhausted. \nZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING \nThe apartment is quiet. Anna no where in sight, more than likely in her room sleeping. \nJack is passed out on the couch. Zoey walks in, it's obvious she hasn't slept all night. \nShe scoots Jack's legs over and sits on the couch. She proceeds to pick up the file folder. \nShe starts thumbing through the documents. After a few moments she finds one of interest. \nShe reaches over and pushes Jack. \nJACK (rousing up) Ehhh...what? You better be a hot bear of a man. \nJack looks up and sees Zoey. \nJACK (CONT'D) Or Zoey...What do you need hun? \nZoey hands Jack a document from the folder. \nLOUIS And a battle cry is going to give me the advantage in battle? \nRYAN BLOOD Of course it will. Why don't you try one out? \nLOUIS What? \nRYAN BLOOD Yeah, try one out right now. It's liberating. \nLOUIS I'd rather not. \nRYAN BLOOD Come on. \nLOUIS (extremely confused) Right here? \nRYAN BLOOD Here I'll go first- \nRyan let's out a scream that sounds as though he is being sodomized. \nLOUIS That was...interesting. \nRYAN BLOOD See? (beat) Your turn. \nLouis looks around. \nLOUIS So right now? \nRYAN BLOOD Of course. \nLouis inhales deeply and then lets out a scream. It comes out more like frightened little girl. \nRYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) Oh come on! That sounds like you are scared of the battle. What? Are you scared of Quinn? You probably are- \nLouis lets out another scream, this one is slightly better. \nRYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) That's good! Come on! \nLouis lets out another one that actually causes Ryan to jump back. \nRYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) Yes that's what I'm talking about! \nOut of nowhere, Quinn walks up to the two of them. \nRYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) (noticing Quinn) Quinn?!? Good to see you! \nQuinn grabs Louis' arm. \nQUINN We need to talk. \nLOUIS (to Ryan) Excuse me for a second. \nLouis walks with Quinn to a spot that gives them some distance away from Ryan. \nQUINN I know that guy and I don't trust him. \nMRS. RHODES You have to calm down and meditate. \nZOEY Um...no...listen do you know Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks? They grew up here. \nMrs. Rhodes steps back like a vampire who has just seen a cross. \nMRS. RHODES No...You need to leave! \nZOEY What? \nMRS. RHODES And give me your shirt. \nZOEY Um...no. \nZoey turns around and starts to leave. Mrs. Rhodes starts screaming at the top of her lungs. \nMRS. RHODES You better make your peace with God girl! The end is coming, those boys are ushering in a new era! \nZoey runs down the hallway toward the front door. \nEXT. ORPHANAGE \nZoey runs outside and makes it to her car. She hits the roof of her vehicle in anger \nZOEY What a fucking nut house! \nJAKE (O.S.) (monotone) Excuse me! \nZoey jumps up and screams. She sees Jake standing creepily behind her. \nZOEY What! \nJAKE (monotone) I know the young boys you speak of. \nZOEY (doesn't care) And? \nJAKE (monotone) I was here when Quinn got sent to the mental hospital. It was like the other one set it up. \nZOEY Wait Louis? You think Louis made Quinn appear crazy? \nJAKE (monotone) They both believed the same thing. Louis was just smart enough to hide it. \nZOEY There is more to it than that. \nJAKE (monotone) I don't understand \nZOEY Listen \"Robot Boy\", where did this whole belief come from? This isn't something two kids come up with on their own. \nJAKE (monotone) Yes I believe a seed was planted. \nZOEY Exactly. I heard there was an employee that got fired for sharing Mormon mythology with the boys. \nJAKE (monotone) No. Off base. He's not the right one. \nJACK I got a text about thirty minutes ago. I'm pretty sure she is going to head to Quinn's apartment. \nANNA Jack... JACK What? \nANNA Her Christ Complex is going to get her killed. \nJACK Trust me I know Anna. (beat) I know... \nKNOCKING is heard at the door. Anna gets up to answer. \nJACK (CONT'D) Maybe it's Quinn the jackass. \nAnna just gets the door opened a crack when... \nRyan and Louis BURST into the room. Anna SCREAMS. Louis restrains her against a wall. \nJack gets up from the couch, but he meets a gun handle to the head from Ryan. \nRYAN BLOOD Good afternoon boys and girls! I need your assistance. \nINT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER \nQuinn walks into his room. To his surprise, Zoey is sitting on his bed. It appears she has been there for a while. \nQUINN How do people keep ending up in my room? \nZOEY (laughs) You need to learn to lock up. \nQuinn walks over and sits on the bed beside her. \nQUINN I'm not fighting Louis. \nZOEY Why the change of heart? \nQUINN I think you might be right. I don't think it's necessary. I think the world will keep turning one way or another. I'm not dependant on that. (beat) I'm not a savior. \nZOEY Do you really believe? You know? \nQUINN Yes. I do believe it. I know it actually. Since I have been with you, I've doubted what I know to be fact though. Then it hit me, it really doesn't matter. \nZOEY I'll help you Quinn. I don't want to do it for myself... (MORE) \nZOEY (CONT'D) I don't want to do it because I feel I have to. Obligations, or dark incidents from my past...That's not a reason to help anyone. It makes me fucking selfish actually. \nQUINN You're not selfish Zoey. \nZOEY I care about you Quinn. That's sincerely my reason for wanting to do this. That's a first for me you know? \nQUINN I know... \nQuinn hugs her and they slowly lay down on the bed together. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nJACK Ass fuck salad- \nQuinn puts the duct tape back on Jack's mouth. Even though we can't make out what he is saying, he is still running off at the mouth. \nQUINN That actually felt kind of good. \nQuinn pats Jack on the head. \nQUINN (CONT'D) I'll be back guys. \nQuinn leaves the room. Muffled cursing can be heard through out the apartment. \nCLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S BED \nA long black box is pulled out from under Quinn's bed. We see Quinn's hands unlatch and then open it. \nInside we see Quinn's katana. His hand grips the hilt. \nINT. QUINN'S ROOM \nQuinn gets up, holding his katana and ready for a fight. He's dressed in a black biker jacket, kind of looking like the Bride from Kill Bill. \nHe walks to the doorway. He stands still for a second. He's preparing his next move. \nBad ass comic book pose...'nuff said. CUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: DAY ZERO THE ENDGAME \nDREAM SEQUENCE \nSTART CHOIR MUSIC \nINT. CHURCH \nThe front doors to the church swing open. Light fills the sanctuary. Zoey walks through the doors. \nShe heads toward the alter and sees a man, in his 50's, kneeling. It appears he might be praying. \nShe places her hand on his shoulder. As he turns around she sees her Dad. \nZOEY I'm not doing it anymore. You will not have redemption from me. \nDAD (raspy) Zoey... \nHe reaches for her, she pulls away. She starts to back up. \nZOEY Take ownership of what you did. Don't rely on me to save you. I need to start saving myself. \nShe slowly backs up and then turns to walk away. \nZOEY (CONT'D) (as she is turning) Goodbye. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nLouis is irritated. \nLOUIS Will you shut up?!? You are ruining my climatic fight. \nLouis spies Quinn in the distance. \nLOUIS (CONT'D) Showtime. \nSTART CHOIR MUSIC \nQuinn lowers his katana, it brushes against the blades of grass. Louis follows suit as he slowly walks to meet Quinn in the middle. \nThe two warriors stand on opposite sides of the battle field. \nEND CHOIR MUSIC \nQuinn looks over and sees Zoey. \nQUINN Let her go! \nRyan grabs her tighter. \nRYAN BLOOD Not yet... \nQUINN (To Louis) Is this the game you want to play? \nLOUIS I'm not going to lose this time. \nZOEY (To Quinn) I thought you didn't believe this shit anymore. \nQUINN There's more going on than you realize Zoey. \nZOEY This is fucked. Quinn you're not 5000 years old. You were born in an orphanage. None of this makes sense. \nLOUIS Lady, it would look weird if we roamed the earth for 5000 years without facing a mortal death! We keep getting reborn, sometimes we even switch physical form. Thanks for coming to the game late missy! \nZOEY That makes total fucking sense. Color me stupid! \nQUINN (to Louis) You don't get it do you. LOUIS What?!? \nQUINN If you win...you're not becoming the antichrist. \nLOUIS What are you talking about?? \nQUINN It's   Ryan...it's always been Ryan. \nLOUIS (To Ryan) What is he talking about? \nRYAN BLOOD He's pitting us against each other. \nQUINN I'm going to be honest with you Louis. I've always been honest. \nLOUIS Yeah sometimes to a fault. \nQuinn turns toward Louis. He pulls his katana up to attack position and Louis follows suit. \nZOEY (tearing up) Wow...yeah goodbye. \nQuinn and Louis charge each other. Zoey doesn't bother to stay to watch the battle. She slowly walks away. \nQuinn and Louis' swords meet. The clang is triumphant. Details of this climatic battle will be choreographed by the actors involved, but think high flying Shaw Brothers film. \nWe don't see a clear victor, just the two boys going at it until we can't tell who is who. \nOTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD-AWAY FROM THE BATTLE \nZoey starts to make a call on her cell phone. \nCLOSE SHOT-CELL PHONE \nShe starts to dial 911. Her thumb moves in the position to hit send. \nOTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD \nZoey stops. She slowly puts her phone away. She looks back toward where the battle is going on. \nShe starts to walk back. The walk turns into a jog. Finally the jog turns into a full run. \nOPEN FIELD \nWhen she gets to the field Quinn and Louis are gone. All that can be seen is Ryan Blood's body, two katanas and an empty ninja suit. Zoey leans down and touches Quinn's katana. \nZOEY (laughs to herself) I am Curious:Yellow (beat) Goodbye boys... \nZoey stares out into the open field. She feels reborn. She knows there is a new world, a new perspective for her beyond the horizon. \nCUT TO: \nBLACKNESS \nTITLE CARD: 70 YEARS LATER \nINT. UNIVERSITY CONFERANCE HALL \nThe camera slowly pans toward an older ninety year old Zoey. She's behind a podium, there is a sign on the front that reads: Marshal University Association of Free Thought. \nZOEY For years we have thought absence of the impossible indicated that we were exercising free thought. In my experience ladies and gentleman, that's not the case. (beat) Believing in hope my friends, opening yourself up to accepting there might be more than the world around you. That's truly being a free thinker. \nThe camera ends with a close shot on Zoey's face. \nEXT. PARK-RIVERSIDE-LATER \nZoey sits on the same bench where she met Quinn. Her great-granddaughter, JENNIFER walks up. She sits down beside her grandmother. \nJENNIFER Hey Grandma. \nZOEY Hey... \n", "test1_input": "We follow Anna across the room where she plops herself down on the couch. \nANNA I promised her we would behave. \nA KNOCK is heard at the front door. \nANNA (CONT'D) Although knocking right as I sat down doesn't endear him to me... \nJack gets up from the desk. \nJACK You sit your pretty little ass down hooker. \nAnna adjusts herself back down into the comfy couch. \nANNA This is why I don't need a boyfriend. You are way to good to me. \nJack opens the door to reveal Quinn. \nJACK Look at this mother fucker. \nHe rudely motions him to come in and sit down. \nJACK (CONT'D) Zoey is in the bathroom getting ready for a night of manipulation, sit the fuck down. \nQUINN (confused) Um...OK? \nIn almost the same beat, Zoey walks into the room. \nZOEY Quinn, is he being rude? \nQUINN (looking at Jack) No quite pleasant. \nZoey reaches out her hand to help Quinn off the couch. \nZOEY Let's go. \nJACK (looking at Quinn) I will call the state police in a fucking heart beat if she isn't here by midnight. \nQUINN (still confused) OK? \nAnna grabs the remote trying to ignore the situation. \nZOEY Anna, you going to call the guard dog off? \nANNA (out of it) David Smith's Candytakers is on tonight. I'm relaxing and not getting in the middle. \nQUINN (To Jack and Anna) Nice meeting both of you. \nJACK Get the fuck out. \nZOEY (to Jack and Anna) Don't wait up \nZoey and Quinn leave the apartment as Jack stares daggers. \n", "test1_true": "Zoey shuts the door and then turns to stop Quinn. \nZOEY Sorry about Jack... \nQUINN I like him. \nINT. RESTAURANT-MOMENTS LATER \nZoey and Quinn are enjoying their meal at this fancy upscale establishment. Quinn picks up his menu, running his finger down though the menu items. \nQUINN Zoey I would be more than happy to pay. \nZOEY No not at all. This is on me. \nQUINN I can cover dessert at least. \nZOEY Listen Quinn, I'm an atheist- \nQUINN -So you don't want dessert?- \nZOEY -No, I just wanted to get it out of the way. It bothers people, I mean in this state especially. \nQuinn puts down the menu. \nQUINN It doesn't bother me. \nZOEY Really? \nQUINN I don't believe anyone is truly an atheist at the end. \nZOEY I'm pretty sure I'm really an atheist. \nQUINN Why's that? \nZOEY Because I'm a logical thinker. (beat) I don't mean to offend, I'm guessing you're religious. \nQUINN One supports the business they are in I guess. \nZOEY Oh my God you are in the ministry. \nQUINN (smiles) Kind of. \nZOEY My father was a \"fire and damnation\" preacher. Baptist...He's... \nQUINN He's? \nZOEY It's nothing. (beat) Sorry I don't mean to rock your world. \nQUINN (smiles) You didn't. \nZOEY You poor thing. You are probably so desperate for friends- \n", "test2_input": "TREE \nFrom behind a tree we see RYAN BLOOD for the first time. He hides in the shadows taking pictures with his digital camera. \nQuinn and Louis continue to practice unaware of the unwanted attention. \nINT. CAFE-DAY \nLouis sips his coffee, while Quinn just stares out the front window. It almost as if he is searching for something. \nLOUIS You have not been lively at all this go around. \nQUINN A lot on my mind... \nLOUIS We only do this once every seventy years brother. You have to enjoy it while it lasts. QUINN Louis our whole purpose here, is to show up, and over time establish a social base, and then kill each other. \nLOUIS You know and I'm very good at the social base part, and you are not so good... \nQUINN That's because you find a way to screw it up every time. \nLOUIS That's because, I know this is news to you, I represent evil. (MORE) \nLOUIS (CONT'D) Here's the thing though, I'm tired Quinn. I really want to stop being the ambassador for this. \nQUINN That's something we agree on. I'm tired too. \nLOUIS I don't know if we can get off this train. It's just a viscous cycle. \nQUINN Letting you win is not an option. \nLOUIS I wasn't going there... (beat) ...yet. \nINT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-EVENING \nQuinn is sitting on the couch as Jack and Anna make their way for the door. \nZOEY (O.S.) You guys leaving? \nZoey comes out of the kitchen with a bowl of popcorn. \nJACK Yeah we don't want to interrupt your \"date rape\". \nAnna hits Jack. ANNA Jesus Jack! He can't do anything here anyway. Too much exposure. Witnesses my friend...We knew he was here. \nZoey sits down and hands the bowl to Quinn. \nZOEY Will you guys stop?? \nQUINN It's OK. I like your friends. \nAnna walks over to the couch. \nANNA So Quinn? \n", "test2_true": "ANNA Zoey says you are in the ministry? \nQUINN Sort of. \nANNA You are or you aren't. \nQUINN It's complicated. \nANNA At some point you will have to explain it to Zoey. I mean don't you agree? \nQUINN Well... \nZOEY (put out) Will you guys leave?? \nJack grabs Anna by the arm and leads her to the door. \nJACK Who is going too far now? \nANNA \"Date Rape\" \nZOEY (trying to make a point) Bye guys! \nAnna and Jack mumble as they head out the door. \nZOEY (CONT'D) (turning to Quinn) Sorry about that. \nQUINN It's really OK. \nEXT. APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS \nJack puts his arm around Anna, as to stop her for a second. \nJACK You know I hate him because it's my nature but- \nANNA -You think I hate him because of my distrust of men? \nJACK Tragedy changes people, it effected Zoey in one way...you in another. \nANNA Yeah (beat,smiles) I became a \"fag hag\" \nBACK TO: \nINT.ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS \nZoey is curled up next to Quinn on the couch. A popcorn bowl is squeezed in between them. She reaches over and picks up the remote. \nZOEY Tonight's Feature Presentation is \"I am Curious:Yellow\". Probably not the best date movie, but I always show this to ever guy in the beginning. \nQUINN It's OK this will be my first film experience. ZOEY What?? \nQUINN Yeah, I've never seen a film before. I mean I know of films, can't live in this world and not. I've just never seen one. \n", "test3_input": "JACK (O.S.) What the fuck?!? I want to watch Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia in peace! \nQUINN I need to see Zoey. \nANNA What about tomorrow? Or never is good. \nYou hear Zoey off screen. ZOEY (O.S.) What's going on?? \nZoey comes to the doorway and stands behind Anna. \nZOEY (CONT'D) Quinn? What's wrong? \nQUINN I need to talk to you, it's important. \nQuinn grabs her by the arm and pulls her outside, pushing her right past Anna. \nANNA Jesus Christ! \nAnna slams the door shut, leaving Zoey and Quinn outside. \nQUINN I need to tell you everything. Anna is so right. \nZOEY What are you talking about? Anna is right? \nQUINN I've not been honest with you about what I do...or who I am. \nZOEY OK? \nQUINN I need to come clean. I want you to trust me. I want your friends to trust me. \nZOEY (nervous laugh) OK Quinn, just spit it out. \nQUINN OK (beat) I'm an archangel named Moroni and I basically represent \"light\" or everything that's good. Louis, my friend, represents \"darkness\". Every seventy years we have to fight to the death. If I win everything stays the way it is. The world continues turning. If I lose, Louis takes on the role of the Antichrist and the apocalypse will be unleashed. I'm talking Book of Revelations stuff here. So I only have a limited time left in this world... (beat) I want to spend that time with you. \nZoey is stunned, silent. \nZOEY Oh honey... \nZoey touches his face. \nZOEY (CONT'D) You must have a brain tumor or something. You're obviously mentally ill. \nQUINN Zoey? I... \nZoey puts her finger up to his lips to quiet him. \nZOEY Shhh. You need me more than ever. \nZoey reaches down and takes a confused Quinn's hand. She leads him to the door. Like a sheep herder, she takes Quinn inside of the apartment. \nThe last image we see is the apartment door slamming behind them. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S HOME-YEARS EARLIER-DAY \nZoey, roughly 2 years old, sits in the floor of her parent's home playing. \nHer DAD, only seen from the waist down, walks in front of Zoey with his bible in hand. He makes it to Zoey's MOM, on the other side of the room \nDAD You're not even helping me! \nMOM I don't even know what you want! \nDAD I can't run my congregation with this sickness! MOM The sickness is in your head. \nDAD You're too busy running around doing whatever you feel like. I'm going to fall apart and it's all on you. \nFLASHBACK-ZOEY'S HOME-TEN YEARS LATER-DAY \nZoey, now 12, is going through some boxes in the closet. Her head bumps a shelf and a box falls on her. \nWhen she goes to pick up the box she finds a ton of VHS tapes. \nShe goes through the box looking at the labels: \"Anna age 7\" \"Anna age 10\" \"Anna age 12\". \nFLASHBACK-ZOEY'S ROOM-A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nThe glow of Zoey's TV fills her face. We can neither see nor hear what she is watching. \nZoey looks like she is about to throw up. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nINT. ZOEY'S BEDROOM-PRESENT DAY-MORNING \nZoey jumps out of bed, like she is waking from a nightmare. A startled Quinn, who was sleeping beside her, starts to arouse. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nTITLE CARD: 2 DAYS LEFT \nINT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER \nLouis walks into Quinn's room with his black tote bag from earlier. It's obvious he was meeting Quinn to go train. \nHe looks through out the room, but quickly realizes Quinn is probably with Zoey. He slumps down on Quinn's bed. Anger and hurt is portrayed upon his face. \nINT.CAFE-LATER \nQuinn and Zoey are having coffee. It's obvious Zoey had a rough night. She takes a sip of coffee, her mind is distant. \nQUINN Last night? \nZOEY Yes? \n"}

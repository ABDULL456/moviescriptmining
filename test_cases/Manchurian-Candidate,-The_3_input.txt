ROSIE 
Earth to Ben -- how're you doing in there? 
104   INT. BATHROOM - MARCO                                             104 
hyper, rummaging through the vanity, searching for -- pair of cuticle scissors, tweezers, anything sharp -- a little basket of sample perfumes CRASHES into the sink -- 
ROSIE (O.S.) 
(KNOCKING loudly) Ben, what's going on -- are you okay --? Marco finds a razor blade -- twisting it clumsily in his fingers to reach the slight bump on his back he can only barely see in the mirror -- 
105   INTERCUT - ROSIE - OUTSIDE THE DOOR                               105 
-- Rosie's KNOCKING HARDER, NOW. 
ROSIE 
Ben, I need you to open this door.    Okay? Just for a sec. (beat) You're scaring me. Ben --? 
106   INT. BATHROOM - MARCO                                             106 
He SLASHES at the lump.   Blood blossoms.   SLASHES again, oblivious to pain. 
ROSIE 
BEN MARCO!? 
PUSH IN as Ben presses the blade sharply down into his skin ... cutting a slit through which the blunt edge of 
AN EXTREMELY TINY OBLONG THING 
appears, like a grain of rice.   It slides out into Ben's bloody fingers. 107   Rosie's PUSHING against the door, trying to force it open.        107 
108   MARCO                                                             108 
puts his trembling hand under the faucet, grips the thing between two fingers, turns on the water -- 
109   THE DOOR - ROSIE                                               109 
breaks in -- sees the BLOOD smeared down Marco's back -- 
ROSIE 
Oh Jesus. -- and the razor in his hand -- she pushes him away -- 
MARCO 
-- loses his grip on the oblong thing before he can even get a good look at it, and it goes into the sink -- 
MARCO 
SHIT.    Oh no NO ... -- and down the drain -- Marco twists the faucet off, and 
DIVES TO 
FLOOR LEVEL - UNDER THE SINK 
where he puts both hands on the fittings of the u-joint trap and struggles to get them loose -- succeeding finally, water spewing everywhere -- -- the trap falls to the floor, disgorging soap chips, slimy hairballs and pipe corrosion and water ... but not the thing he wants. It's -- 
MARCO 
-- Gone.    Shit. MARCO -- rests his head on the cool tile, eyes far away. Defeated. Rosie crouches next to him. A little scared. She blots the blood from his back with the towel, and then presses her ice pack against it. 
MARCO 
Tell me you saw that. Rosie just stares at him. 
MARCO 
(hollow) You didn't. You didn't see it. 
ROSIE 
See what? Marco closes his eyes. 
MARCO 
Proof. 
ROSIE 
Of what? 
MARCO 
My sanity. 
110   EXT. ISOLATED WAREHOUSE - ON THE HUDSON RIVER - DAY            110 
Stark building with a huge parking lot and only one car parked in it. A CAB pulls through the open gate, stops. Marco gets out. 
DELP (V.O.) 
Implant delusions. Number three on the paranoid top ten list. 
111   INT. WAREHOUSE STAIRWAY - DAY                                  111 
Ben and RICHARD DELP ascend at a good clip. Delp wears a lab coat, trappings of a medical researcher: 
MARCO 
This wasn't a delusion. 
DELP 
That's what they all say, Marco. (then) Some wicked shit got sprayed on you guys during Desert Storm. Besides all the depleted uranium, I mean ... He stops, unlocks a door, and they go -- 
112   INT. DELP'S RESEARCH LAB - SKY BOOTH - DAY                     112 
A narrow, glassed-in space with a cluster of monitoring equipment against the wall of darkened windows. Fluorescent lights flicker on, revealing a CAVERNOUS SPACE BELOW, in which an intricate MAZE of CAGES contains unhappy, SCREAMING research MONKEYS with Orwellian stainless-steel hardware and antennae bolted to their bisected skulls. Strange SOUNDS and various LIGHTING EFFECTS emerge from the different sections. 
DELP 
... I personally know of a coupla Rangers who swear that they see only in tertiary colors now -- 
MARCO

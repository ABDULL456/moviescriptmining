HAZEL Are you saying -- 
GUS I'm not gonna give you my Wish or anything. But I too have an interest in meeting Peter Van Houten and it wouldn't make much sense to meet him without the girl who introduced me to his book, now would it? (Hazel's eyes widen) I talked to the Genies and they're in total agreement. 
(BEAT) We leave on May third. Hazel is so excited that she grabs Gus and pulls him into a hug. Their faces close, lips inches apart, and just when it looks like something might happen -- 
HAZEL Wait a minute. 
(BEAT) Are you only doing this so I'll kiss you? A beat. Gus blinks a few times. 
HAZEL Cause I'd totally kiss you either way. And kiss him she does. He's surprised. And when it's over, they sit back, look at one another. A magic moment. 
HAZEL Seriously... why are you doing this? 
GUS Because Hazel Grace... I found my Wish. And Hazel is beyond touched. We hear: 
FRANNIE (OVERLAP) Are you out of your mind? 
INT HAZEL'S UTILITY ROOM - DAY Frannie folds laundry while Hazel pleads her case. 
FRANNIE It's too much, Haze. We can't accept something like that from a virtual stranger. 
HAZEL He's not a stranger. 
FRANNIE Really? 
HAZEL Don't be gross. 
FRANNIE It's still "no," I'm afraid. 
HAZEL Can we at least ask Dr. Maria? 
INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY Where Hazel's oncologist DR. MARIA shakes her head. 
DR. MARIA That's out of the question. 
HAZEL You said the PET scan was encouraging! 
DR. MARIA The PET scan is encouraging. We just don't know how long it'll stay that way. What if you get sick in a foreign country? 
HAZEL They have doctors in Amsterdam. And cancer. Someone will know what to do. 
DR. MARIA Be that as it may, without someone familiar with your particular case, I can't -- 
HAZEL (turns to her Mom) So you'll come too. 
FRANNIE What? 
HAZEL The Genies can hook it up. They're loaded. 
FRANNIE 
I -- 
HAZEL You've never been to Amsterdam, have you Mom? And judging from her face, seems she'd kinda like to. Dr. Maria looks at Frannie, shrugs - kid's got a point. Hazel smiles. And on that smile, we SMASH CUT TO: 
BLACK. Over which, we HEAR: 
HAZEL (V.O.) And then this happened. 
INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT [Note: There's no sound in this sequence. Just images.] Hazel wakes up screaming in the middle of the night, shaking and holding her head. Frannie and Michael burst in. Mom grabs her crying daughter, frightened beyond belief, waves to Michael to call for help. 
HAZEL (V.O.) People talk about the courage of cancer patients. And I do not deny that courage... He leaves the room to do so and Fran stays behind, rocking with her daughter, promising her it'll all be ok. Whatever nightmare this is, it's going to end. CUT TO: 
INT FRANNIE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER Still silent. Michael drives, trying to keep it together. Frannie's in the back with Hazel's head in her lap. 
Hazel continues to scream in silence, whether from pain or terror, we do not know.

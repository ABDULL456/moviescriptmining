CINDY You know, we rarely sit down and have a conversation. An adult conversation. Because every time we do, you turn something that I say around and make it mean something that I didn't mean to say. You just blab. Blab. 
DEAN If you're not interested in hearing what I think I just won't say anything. 
CINDY Good luck. I just want you to think about what you say sometimes instead of saying what you think all the time.

DEAN OK. I'm going to say something. And what I'm about to say I've thought long and hard about. I'm the luckiest person alive because I'm living my dream - you, her, this, us, all of it. 
Cindy lifts up her empty wine glass to the light. 
CINDY I think my glass has a hole in it. 
Cindy cuts around her food and pushes a piece aside. 
DEAN What's wrong with that? 
CINDY It's fat. 
DEAN That's the flavor. Eat it. 
CINDY I don't want to. You eat it. 
Dean stabs a piece of fat and pops it into his mouth. 
CINDY (CONT'D) That's going straight to your tits. 
DEAN My tits? I got tits? 
Dean opens his shirt and peers down at his chest. 
DEAN (CONT'D) I could still kick yer ass.

CINDY Shiiit. I bet you a nickel you can't even beat me at arm wrestling. 
DEAN A dime and you're on. 
Cindy gulps more champagne. They scoot dishes out of the way and clasp hands in the middle of the table. 
CINDY Ready? 
DEAN I'm always ready, baby. 
CINDY On the count of three... One... Two... 
Cindy flexes and starts. 
CINDY (CONT'D) THREE! 
Dean, acting as if he isn't trying at all, holds Cindy's hand at a stand still. 
DEAN Come on. Go! Start. 
Cindy ignores his taunts and pushes as hard as she can. Slowly, she begins to push Dean's hand down. Dean groans, letting her win a little. Cindy presses down with all her weight. His hand is centimeters from hitting the table. Then, he turns the tide. Cindy battles back with all the strength she can muster. Dean laughs, realizing her passion for victory. Dean pounds her hand into the table. He stands kisses his flexed bicep. Cindy lifts her hand. A fork is stuck in the back of it. She looks at it with curiosity. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Oh fuck. 
CINDY I'm alright.

DEAN Hold still. 
He plucks the fork from her hand, leaving four vampire bites. 
CINDY Ow ow ow. 
Dean leads her to the kitchen, holds her hand under the faucet. 
DEAN You think we should rush you to the hospital before you bleed to death?

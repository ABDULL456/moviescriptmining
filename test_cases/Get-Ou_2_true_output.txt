ROSE Let's see, you're smart, sweet, handsome, creative... You're you. 
CHRIS Good answer. 
Chris packs in silence for a moment. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Do they know I'm black? 
Rose is taken aback by the question. 
ROSE I don't think so. Why? Should they? 
CHRIS Seems like you might give them a heads up. 
ROSE Really? Like "Mom, Dad, my black boyfriend is coming up for the weekend"? 
CHRIS You said, I'm the first black guy you'd ever dated. 
ROSE Yeah...? 
CHRIS So this is uncharted territory for them. 
Rose embraces him. 
ROSE Baby, it's fine. My dad would legit vote for Obama a third time he could. Yes, he will want to talk to you about it, and that will be embarrassing, but they're gonna love you. I promise. 
Chris nods. She kisses his neck and pulls him to the bed. 
INT. BROOKLYN LOFT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Chris turns on the TV for Sid. He and Rose stand by the front door about to leave. 
CHRIS Bye. 
ROSE See you soon. 
Rose blows Sid a kiss and they leave. 
EXT. BROOKLYN NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY 
Chris puts his luggage in the trunk and enters the passenger's side of a shiny white BMW X5. 
INT. BROOKLYN NIEGHBORHOOD STREET - PARKED CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Rose sits in the driver's seat. Chris gets in the passenger seat. Her car is a mess. 
CHRIS How do they even let you in a hospital? 
ROSE Shut up. I'm very sanitary at work. 
She moves some fast food wrappers to the back seat. 
ROSE (CONT'D) You ready? 
CHRIS Yeah. You? 
ROSE Oh, wait. 
She raises her phone and takes a selfie of the two of them. 
ROSE (CONT'D) Ready. 
Chris puts his hand on her leg, and they drive off. 
EXT. NEW YORK - CITY - CONTINUOUS 
The car leaves the city. 
EXT. RURAL ROAD - BIRD'S-EYE VIEW - DAY 
We soar over the car as it drives through the beautiful countryside; a road flanked by woods.

SGT. NANTZ Stavrou? 
CPL. STAVROU She's dead, Sergeant. Nantz looks around, warily. The streets are quiet, deserted. 
SGT. NANTZ All right, dismount. Grab anything you think we can use. The men nod, and move OUT OF THE LAV to... 
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS 
Correggio and Kerns on one side of the street, Stavrou and Harris on the other. Imlay with Adukwu. Nantz watches his men move forward, covering each other's advance. Scanning' the buildings, searching for targets... Then Nantz halts them. They crouch together, peering at... The middle of the DEAD ZONE just ahead of them. It is very dark. No lights are visible from any source. The men SWEAT. 
PVT. IMLAY Hot as hell here. 
CPL. CORREGGIO No lights. 
PVT. ADUKWU My watch stopped. 
SGT. NANTZ Something's generating heat. Messing with our electronics. Sucking up all the power... Nantz scans the street. The sweat dripping into his eyes. 
SGT. NANTZ Where would you put a critical asset if you wanted to protect it? Or hide it? 
CPL. HARRIS Underground. Nantz points to A SUBWAY ENTRANCE AHEAD. 
INT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER 
The squad runs to the subway entrance, stopping just inside. 
SGT. NANTZ Harris, Adukwu, stay here, watch the street. Harris and Adukwu nod. Taking position at the entrance. Nantz motions to the others. 
SGT. NANTZ Let's go. Nantz leads Stavrou, Correggio, Kerns and Imlay down the stopped escalator to the SUBWAY PLATFORM. Nantz stands, gazing around at the empty subway platform. Silent. Spooky. A train is stopped. Doors open. It is dark, the only light bleeding in from the street above. He motions Stavrou to guard against anything coming from above. Then he moves forward with the others. A huge number of BIRDS line the dark cavity above the train tracks, taking cover themselves, roosting quietly. Nantz sees a DOOR in the tunnel wall, heads to it. He pulls his KA-BAR KNIFE out, sticks the blade into the door jam, pops the DOOR OPEN. Nantz turns to Correggio and Kerns. 
SGT. NANTZ 
(QUIETLY) You two stay here, watch our backs. 
(TO IMLAY) Imlay, come with me. Nantz and Imlay slip through the doorway. 
INT. UNDERGROUND SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Nantz and Imlay stand very still, peering down the long, dark hall, looking for movement. Nantz motions and they move forward silently, guns ready. They turn a corner and stop. It is PITCH BLACK here. Nantz clicks on his flashlight. They move forward. After only a few feet, the FLASHLIGHT DIMS AND DIES. Imlay clicks on his flashlight. 
SGT. NANTZ 
(WHISPERING) No. Save it. Something is killing anything electronic we use. Imlay clicks his flashlight OFF. But now we see... A dim light ahead. Nantz and Imlay creep forward, very slowly. Turn a corner, see... A STRANGE LIGHT at the end of the hallway. THE LIGHT GLOWS fiercely, as if it's shining through the floor. Nantz, silhouetted by the light, signals Imlay to stay put. Nantz steps forward, toward the strange glow of light. As he approaches, he realizes it's coming through... An IRON GRATE in the floor. Nantz moves to the grate, kneels, PEERING DOWN INTO... 
A MASSIVE SUBWAY TUNNEL Fifty feet wide, the dim tunnel has been further EXCAVATED. It is a huge CAVERN now, extending off into the distance further than Nantz can see. The huge space is illuminated by MASSES OF ALIEN MACHINERY. An ELECTRIC HUM FILLS THE AIR. Tending the machinery: DOZENS OF ALIENS, bigger than the others. One of the ALIENS TURNS, focusing up, right at Nantz. Nantz spins, runs back into the darkness. Calling to Imlay: 
SGT. NANTZ Run, Imlay! Run! BANG. The iron GRATE FLIES into the air.

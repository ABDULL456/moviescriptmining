DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
Gorgeous, huh..Pretty, fabulous, beautiful. What word is the same in Spanish? 
FLOR 
Fabuloso. 
DEBORAH 
(taking it as a compliment) Thanks. 
84   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY.                       84 
As Deborah, Flor and Evelyn enter. They carry boxes of stuff. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
I don't care if it's a rental..this place is getting a fixing. She leads Flor to a small bedroom. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
(to Flor with gestures) This will be yours.. Flor doesn't understand..certainly doesn't want to. 
EVELYN 
Did you ask her if she could live in? 
DEBORAH 
Come on...there's no buses from her to here. There's no question. Double come on... Deborah uses her hand as if weighing something momentous like the law vs. the bible then with heavy sarcasm. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
The Barrio - Carbon Beach..The Barrio - Carbon Beach. What to do? (to Flor) Don't worry. I'm putting nicer stuff in here too. When Flor gives no indication of anything - just standing, somewhat stupefied..Deborah takes her by the hand and leads her out. 
85   EXT. CLASKY - BEACH RENTAL - DAY                            85 
As they move through a little courtyard area toward the street. 
DEBORAH 
You must learn English. Why won't she learn English? I'm going to have to learn, "you must learn English," in Spanish. 
EVELYN 
I think Flor is perfect and we should do all we can to keep her from changing. 
DEBORAH 
Gee, you took the words right out of my mouthay. 
86   EXT. PCH - DAY                                               86 
As she leads Flor along the highway side of Carbon Beach - passing houses until she sees a Hispanic man washing someone's car in a driveway. Evelyn is many steps back. 
DEBORAH 
Oh, good. Do you speak English? 
HISPANIC MAN 
Yes, I do. 
DEBORAH 
Would you translate for me? He looks at Flor..my God. 
HISPANIC MAN 
Sure...forever. He speaks to her in Spanish..a lavish, poetic compliment. Flor, in full control, says, in Spanish.."Would you please just find out what she wants." Evelyn joins them. 
DEBORAH 
Wait till I say something before you start in.. (he looks at her) I rented a house here for the summer and now she must sleep at the house because of the bus schedule. He translates along with Deborah's speech. 
ON FLOR. 
Stricken. She turns to Deborah. 
FLOR 
No.. Sorry. 
DEBORAH 
What? Why? Flor talks briefly in Spanish. 
HISPANIC MAN 
She can't because of her daughter. 
DEBORAH 
You have a daughter? You have a whole daughter you haven't mentioned..How old? 
FLOR 
Twelve. 
DEBORAH 
(to Evelyn) It's a little crazy that I don't know that. The man translates. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
(to man) Don't translate asides. The man says in Spanish to Flor.."You work for her?"--Flor answers, "just tell her that I can't live here." Deborah doesn't like that the man has initiated more conversation. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
Hey! 
HISPANIC MAN 
She can't live here. Her daughter. 
DEBORAH 
Okay.. (beat then big decision) Her daughter can also live with us for the summer.. The man tells Flor..she answers directly to Deborah.. 
FLOR 
(big decision) No, sorry. 
DEBORAH

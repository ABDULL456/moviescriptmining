COMMANDANT Explain. 
TWO-I-C It's very difficult, suh. Our     men are fighting bravely but- 
COMMANDANT But nothing. Take the bridge, that is your task. 
Commandant motions for the MORTAR MAN to set up a mortar to help the HILL ADVANCE. 
EXT. ROAD TO BRIDGE, BURNT VILLAGE - SAME 
Two-I-C and his forward operation team are hunkered down behind a building facing a PLF stronghold -- TWO MACHINE GUN nests with sand bags in front of the heavily defended bridge which looks like a former check point. 
TWO-I-C We need support, suh. The men's spirts are low, suh. 
Behind Two-I-C there is general chaos. The men are not advancing and many are retreating. JUSTICE is yelling at the men around him to help him carry an injured RAMBO to safety, but no one will help him. 
He is driven to tears in the chaos, spinning in circles trying to get a grown-up to help him as Rambo bleeds out on the street. 
COMMANDANT (O.S.) Sustain. 
EXT. BURNT VILLAGE, CENTRAL INTERSECTION - DAY 
Commandant lets his radio hang around his neck, watching the HILL BATTLE progress again. 
COMMANDANT Agu, Strika, come here. Look at this. 
Agu and Strika obey. Commandant holds the scope up for them. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) This is a very special device, you can be seeing the enemy with it, even when they are hiding. 
Agu, through the scope, sees the FORWARD STRIKE NDF SOLDIERS unload and disperse. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) You see? 
He motions for the mortar to fire. Agu looks through it while the first blasts force the PLF to scurry. Strika, impatient for his try, paces. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) It's magic. (to the men) I need volunteers! Who has heart? Who wants to fight with me? Who isn't afraid of bullets!? 
The men ROAR BACK in affirmation. Commandant moves amongst the men, placing his hand on their chest, feeling their hearts. 
When it's Strika's turn to look, Commandant interrupts his try by asking him if he has heart for battle. Conflicted between wanting to try out the scope and the call for battle, he affirms he is ready to fight while the "toy" is put away by the Aide. 
Commandant selects men and boys to go with him, those who aren't selected are pushed aside and kneel down in shame and disappointment. Amongst the selected are Agu, Strika, Hope, Chicken Legs, and Griot. 
An AA technical rushes back around the market towards the intersection under a hailstorm of bullets and clouds of smoke, PREACHER is in the back firing back with RANDY and a couple other SBU's. 
The Technical screeches into position at the top of the intersection leading to the bridge. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Chicken Legs, go! 
Chicken Legs runs to the intersection with Griot in support, to fire an RPG down on the bridge. 
The SELECTED TEAM, about 20 MEN and SBUs, advance towards the bridge. 
EXT. ROAD TO BRIDGE, BURNT VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER 
Commandant CHANTS a war chant, "no retreat, no surrender, men dropping, men moving". The men respond to the CHANT, all of them, a battle cry that rouses. They keep huffing into the chant as Commandant addresses them... 
COMMANDANT These bullets? 
The WHISTLE of bullets increases and, where most rational men would duck, has no affect on Commandant. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) They are nothing. No one can touch us! 
The Commandant pulls a chanting Agu up near him and uses him as an example. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Are you afraid? 
Agu shakes his head, even if inside he is afraid. 
Commandant, along with Tripod and the Controller. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Moove it!    Gentlemen! Moooooove it! 
The NDF SOLDIERS YELL again. A NERVE TINGLING BATTLE CRY. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) No retreat! No surrender! Men dropping! Men moving! 
The bullets whistle by angrily. Then, a tidal wave of wind and fire is laid down on them, tearing up a building's wall and wooden kiosks around them. The men do not flinch, they believe they cannot be hit, although some MEN do go down, the majority continues the advance. 
Agu is astonished, but because everyone else keeps moving, so does he. To his left, Commandant smiles at him, loving the adrenaline of battle. TRIPOD prancing in front of them.

Huey shakes his head in disbelief. 
HUEY We ain't   gonna make it, are we Chuckie?   I ain't never gonna see it. It's   over for that, isn't it Chuckie?   Just say it. 
Chuckie is taken aback by what Huey is saying. He walks away, turns his concentration back to the flashlight. Huey calls after him. 
HUEY (CONT'D) She was just some stupid housewife mouthin' off. 
CHUCKIE GET REAL Huey! And shut the fuck up about the stupid ocean. 
Chuckie gets right up in Huey's face. 
CHUCKIE (CONT'D) I ever break a promise to you? I ever let you down? 
Huey takes his time to answer. 
HUEY No Chuckie, you ain't. 
Chuckie puts his hand on Hueys shoulder and gently pushes him along the road. 
EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING 
Della tries once more to lift the hood. It still won't budge. 
Scene 79Page 44 
When she looks up the flashlight is dancing towards her. 
Vinh sees the car. 
VINH (O.S.) There's her Ford. 
Della grabs the lug wrench and toolbox and ducks behind the trees. 
Della sees them approach her car. 
VINH (CONT'D) There's broken glass everywhere. 
Huey, now resigned to their mission, comments sadly. 
HUEY Someone call her mama tell her to lay out her black dress. 
Della creeps softly along the edge of the trees. She holds her breath. If she makes a sound, she's dead. 
TOMAS Is she dead already? 
The boys kick around the Explorer. 
VINH Musta gone been thrown through the windshield. 
Della skims the trees, constantly checking behind her, to where her antagonists check out the Ford wreck. 
Chuckie points to some footprints. 
CHUCKIE She ain't dead. Look! Her footprints are all around. 
When there's enough distance between them and her, she darts from the forest's edge into the development and hides behind a half finished house. 
EXT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 1 - EVENING 
She leans against a recently bricked wall, finally takes a breath. The smell of fresh cement and putty fills her nostrils. 
Scene 80Page 45 
Rain gathers and drips from a nearby ledge 
She peers around the side of the house. 
EXT. EDGE OF WOODS/CONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING 
Beyond the rows of plots of land with their sold signs, she sees the boys still pacing and debating beside her Ford, illuminated by the sweeping light rays of their flashlight. 
Her eyes drift across the landscape of house foundations and structures to the distant neon lights of the shopping mall. 
When she looks back over for the boys, she sees that the flashlight and the boys are gone. 
She strains her eyes. Guesses that must mean they're off looking for her in another direction. 
She clutches the tool box and silently creeps between the houses. 
If she could just track along the edge of the development she could maybe make it back to the Shopping Mall, to the twins.

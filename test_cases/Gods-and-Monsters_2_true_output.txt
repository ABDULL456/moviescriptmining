HANNA That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge. 
CLAY You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo. 
HANNA You did not know? 
CLAY Well...no, not really -- 
HANNA You and he are not doing things? 
CLAY No! 
HANNA Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries. 
CLAY I'm not going to hurt anyone. 
HANNA Yes.  I trust you. 
Off in the distance, a throat loudly trumpets itself clear. 
HANNA You must go in.  Quickly.  He will not like to think I have had you in the kitchen. 
Clay gets up slowly, reluctant to leave the room. 
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Whale comes forward as Clay enters, offering a hand at the end of a spindly wrist. 
WHALE How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch. 
CLAY All right, I guess. 
WHALE I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor. 
A hesitant smile from Clay.  Whale picks a stack of mail off the table, rifles through envelopes. 
WHALE Forgive my rudeness.  At my age, the post is the cream of the day. 
He returns the stack to the table but holds on to a square envelope. 
WHALE Do you mind? 
CLAY Go ahead. 
Clay looks off while Whale opens the envelope. 
WHALE Hmmm?  Princess Margaret? 
He is examining a folded card.  He rubs a thumb over the printed lettering. 
WHALE Her Majesty's Loyal Subjects in the Motion Picture Industry... Cordially invited...Reception at the home of...Mr. George Cukor! 
His lips smack open in disgust. 
WHALE That pushy little -- horning in on the Queen's sister, then offering to share her with the whole damn raj?  I live in this country to get away from this rubbish! 
He tosses the invitation on the table. 
WHALE Is this David's doing? 
CLAY This David's a friend? 
WHALE Yes.  An old, useless friend.  You must excuse me, Mr. Boone.  This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment. (a deep breath) Lunch should be ready.  Shall we? 
He holds out an open hand so that Clay can precede him into the dining room. 
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 
Hanna sets down two steaming plates of omelettes.  Whale hands a glass of red wine to Clay. 
WHALE Cheers. 
They both take a sip of wine. 
WHALE Smells lovely, Hanna. 
Hanna nods, steals a glance at Clay as she leaves. 
CLAY Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends. 
WHALE Did you now? 
CLAY I liked it.  We all did.

9 spots a SMALL LEDGE next to a stained glass window. 
He opens the side of the bucket and gestures that they should jump. 
The others hesitate, but then 9, 6, and 5 jump out of the bucket onto a swinging rope, and onto the ledge. The Winged Beast plummets down the shaft after them. 
SEQ. 140 - EXT. CATHEDRAL/CLOCKTOWER - CONTINUOUS 
The ragdolls squeeze through a small crack in the stained glass emerging onto a ledge overlooking the Cathedral's roof. 
9 sees 1 and 8 running across the roof and points to 5 and 6 to look down there. Down on the roof, 1 and 8 see 5, 6, and 9. 1 pushes past 8 and runs farther out, towards the front of the Cathedral. 8 follows. S uddenly, the Winged Beast SMASHES through the glass behind them. It struggles to get through the window but can't quite fit. 
6 is very vulnerable out there. 
9 turns to 5. 
Take him inside. 
now climbs out on the gargoyle purposefully. 
The Winged Beast FLIES UP into the air, circling lazily.    1 and 8, running on the top of the roof, are very exposed. Hawklike, the Winged Beast sails towards them. 
8 steps up to defend 1. He flips his salt-shaker helmet down over his face as armor, pulls out his scissor knife and stands his ground... waiting... waiting for the Winged Beast to soar in closer... 
And then, at the last possible moment, he HURLS his scissor knife at the Winged Beast. It flies through the air and catches in the Beast's propeller. 
Knocked off balance, the Beast swoops down. 1 ducks out of the way but it knocks 8 off his feet. 8 slides down the sloped edge of the roof, towards GAPING HOLE. 
S 
Just as 8 is about to fall into the hole, he catches on to the edge. His other blade plummets through the hole as he hangs, desperately... his grip SLIPPING... 
9 catches up to where 1 is. 
SEQ. 140 - INT. CATHEDRAL - SAME TIME 
6 and 5 run down the banisters towards the crashed plane.     6 seems to pull 5 in a particular direction. 
EQ. 140 - EXT. CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS 
The Winged Beast circles around and sets its harpoon tail to shoot. 1 squints into the sun as the Winged Beast, backlit, swoops down towards them. He sees a glare come from the tin roof. 9 gets an idea.    He gestures to 1 to help him. 1 scowls, but has no alternative but to help him. 
9 peels back a piece of the roof, with 1 helping him.   The ROOF'S 
GLARE 
beams right into the eyes of the Winged Beast, momentarily blinding it. T he Beast flinches just as it FIRES its harpoon tail at them. Blinded by the glare, it MISSES and almost hits 8. 
The harpoon imbeds itself into a rafter inside the Cathedral. 
SEQ. 145 - Wing 
SEQ. 145 - EXT. CATHEDRAL/CLOCKTOWER - CONTINUOUS 
8 falls onto and then slides down the harpoon's line, swinging into the Cathedral and landing on the wing of the airplane embedded in the side of the Cathedral, right next to 5 and 6. 8's weight on the harpoon's line has pulled it more and more taut... 
The Winged Beast is pulled hard into the roof and slides down, knocking into 1 and 9. 
1 and 9 PLUNGE into the Cathedral and onto the plane wing, where 8 catches them in midair before they hit the wing.

I'm your host... your ghost host with the most, baby... Dr. Wolfenstein and will be with you until the end. Aaaaaaahooooooh! 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
Bill stands on the front porch watching as the truck roughly jerks the car to a stop. 
Jerry jumps out, opens the back door and helps Denise. 
JERRY (looking at Bill) Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob. 
DENISE Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death. 
JERRY (quietly to Bill as he passes) Dude, your chick's a little high strung. 
Mary is the last one out of the car. She says nothing as she walks to join the others on the porch. 
Her look says it all as she walks by Bill and into the house. 
BILL Mary, I'm sorry but he left without me. Mary... come on, you don't think I'd leave you stranded out there. 
INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
Everyone stands around at the fireplace, trying to dry off. 
DENISE Look. I gotta call my Dad and tell him we're gonna be late. Can I use your phone? 
Baby sits silently watching TV. 
DENISE Excuse me, may I please use your phone? 
MARY (sarcastically) Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend. 
A VOICE from upstairs answers. 
MOTHER Ain't got one. 
MOTHER comes into view from the darkness above. She is in her fifties, but looks younger. A sleazy white trash queen. She slowly descends the stairs. 
DENISE Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone? 
MOTHER No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more. 
JERRY Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone. 
MOTHER His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J. 
JERRY Oh, right. 
MOTHER What do they call you, sweety? 
JERRY Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary. 
BILL Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage. 
DENISE I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles. 
MOTHER Oh, you ain't no troubles, no, no, no fuss. (claps her hands) Baby... go see what Rufus Jr. is doing with these nice folks' automobile. 
Baby slowly rises like a defiant child and walks out of the room. 
MOTHER In the meanwhile please make yourselves at home. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
MONTAGE 
Gruesome crime scene photos flash across the screen. 
CHILDREN (singing, off screen) 98 bodies in your bed, Some are green, some are red. Eat the flesh and pick the bones, Drink the blood when you get home. 99 bodies in the ground, Some are blue, some are brown. Gather 'round the people said, Where do you go when you are dead? 
INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Mother, Jerry, Denise and Mary are all seated on the sofa. Bill sits in an easy chair. 
MOTHER So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?

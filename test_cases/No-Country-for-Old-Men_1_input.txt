DRIVER Oh. One of the tiedowns worked lose. Bell whips the tarp back to expose eight corpses wrapped blue sheeting bound with tape. 
BELL How many did you leave with? The driver is still smiling. 
DRIVER I ain't lost none of 'em, Sheriff. 
BELL Couldn't you all of took a van out there? 
DRIVER Didn't have no van with four-wheel drive. Sheriff Bell pulls the tarp down and ties it. The driver watches without helping. 
DRIVER ...You going to write me up for improperly secured load? Sheriff Bell cinches the knot tight. 
BELL You get your ass out of here. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
Moss, in bed, stirs at an off screen voice: 
VOICE I'm guessin'... this is not the future you pictured for yourself when you first clapped eyes on that money. Moss blearily focuses on: A fancy crocodile boot. His look rises from the boot, crossed on his visitor's knee, up to the man's face. Carson Wells smiles at him from the bedside chair. 
WELLS ...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you. 
MOSS I know, I've seen him. Sort of. Wells is surprised. 
WELLS You've seen him. And you're not dead. He nods, impressed. 
WELLS ...But that won't last. 
MOSS What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass? 
WELLS I don't think that's how I would describe him. 
MOSS How would you describe him? 
WELLS I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor. His name is Chigurh. 
MOSS Sugar? 
WELLS Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you? 
MOSS I know how he found me. 
WELLS It's called a transponder. 
MOSS I know what it is. He won't find me again. 
WELLS Not that way. 
MOSS Not any way. 
WELLS Took me about three hours. 
MOSS I been immobile. 
WELLS No. You don't understand. Wells sits back and studies Moss. 
WELLS ...What do you do? 
MOSS I'm retired. 
WELLS What did you do? 
MOSS I'm a welder.

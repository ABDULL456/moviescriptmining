{"test1_input": "BRENDA Bobby, come look at this. Bobby joins her. \nBRENDA (CONT'D) (holding the animal) Oh my god! Poor thing. \nBOBBY You two make a perfect pair. Bobby turns to a rusty car and unzips to urinate. \nBRENDA Don't pee there... \nBOBBY Why not? \nBRENDA (pointing to a small \nWOODEN OUTHOUSE) Hello? \nBOBBY God, what do you care? Bobby re-zips and heads towards the small wooden outhouse while Brenda plays with the baby pig. \nBRENDA Piggy, piggy, piggy... \nSOMEONE OBSERVES HER FROM THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE. \n12 EXT. CAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 12 \nIn front of the gas station, Lynn leans on the car giving Catherine a bottle. Big Bob opens the hood while the old man continues to fill the tank. At the same time, Doug comes out of the trailer holding his cell phone. \nDOUG (to the old man) Excuse me sir, do you have a phone I can use? I can't get a signal around here and... Big Bob interrupts. \nBIG BOB Give. the phone a rest, Bukowski! \nDOUG Sorry Bob, \"duty calls\"... \nLYNN Honey, you haven't put that phone down since we left. \nDOUG This is why I don't go on vacation. They're lost without me. \nBIG BOB Stop being at everyone's beck and call, Bukowski. You're the boss, remember? \nETHEL .I'm sure all that important business can wait till next week. Doug gives up. He kisses Lynn and takes the baby from her. \nLYNN \n(TO DOUG) Are you wearing sunblock? The sun's so strong. \n13 INT. SUV - DAY 13 \nWhile they are talking outside, a DEFORMED HAND slides into the back window of the SUV. \nA HAND WITH ONLY THREE STRANGELY PROPORTIONED FINGERS. It moves slowly, snatching BOBBY'S HOODED SWEATER from the back seat. \nSMALL VOICE (O.S.) \n(WHISPERING) .Annnnaaaaau... Under the car the visitor's feet walk way. They are bare, dirty and covered with dust. \n14 INT. / EXT. OUTHOUSE - DAY 14 \nRays of light pass through the wooden planks. The outhouse is so dirty that Bobby is forced to hold his breath... An EYE peeks between the wooden planks! \nBOBBY JUMPS- \nBOBBY What the hell Brenda! The eye goes away... He re-zips looking outside. Nobody. When he exits, Brenda appears on the other side. \n", "test1_true": "BRENDA What? \n15 EXT. GAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 15 \nDoug sits on the porch giving the baby her bottle. The old gas station attendant checks the oil and the water. ,Ethel joins him, holding a road map. \n(CONTINUED) \n15 CONTINUED: 15 \nETHEL How far are we from 1-88? \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT You're at least six or seven hours away'from there. Ethel gives her husband a dirty look. \nETHEL I told you we should have gone through Santa Fe. You never listen to me. \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT This is the only southbound road that goes to 1-88. From there you can take the 231 West to California. But you'll never make it before sundown... \nBIG BOB Doesn't bother me. I had night patrol for almost fifteen years... \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT You a cop? \nBIG BOB Detective... \nETHEL (with a smile) Not anymore. Thank God! \nBIG BOB I'm starting a private security firm... The old man turns to Doug- \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT You a cop too? \nDOUG Who me? No way. I'm in telecommunications. A beat. \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT Huh...Make money in that? \n(CONTINUED) \n15 CONTINUED: (2) 15 \nDOUG Everybody's gotta have a cell phone... \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT Well you won't find any customers around here. \nDOUG No kidding... As the old man closes the hood, a familiar sound returns- \nKRIIINK KRONK - KRIIINK KRONK - KRIIINK KRONK He leans over and catches Bobby and Brenda in the distance, playing with the well. Brenda is about to drink from her hands. \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT (shouting to them) \nDON'T DRINK THAT WATER, MISS. IT \nAIN'T NO GOOD. \n(TO ETHEL) She'll get sick. \nETHEL \nYOU HEAR THAT BRENDA? DON'T DRINK \n", "test1_id": 1668, "test2_input": "(HYSTERICAL) He swore he'd come back to get me. He swore it. Don't let him take me, Bobby!

I \nDON'T WANT TO DIE BOBBY...I DON'T \nWANT TO DIE...DO SOMETHING... Bobby picks up the gun- BANG! BANG! BANG! - With no hesitation, he shoots through the door. Brenda throws herself into Doug's arms. Bobby stares at the bullet holes in the trailer door. Suddenly, the sound of a radio is heard- \nRADIO (O.S.) \"Goggle, you copy? Goggle...\" Bobby and Doug look at each other confused. \n(CONTINUED) \n/\u00cf\u00bf\u00bd 85 CONTINUED: (4) 85 \nRADIO (O.S.) (CONT'D) \"Goggle?\" Doug silently moves closer to the door. From outside we can see Doug's eye through one of the bullet holes. Nobody, everything seems quiet. \nDOUG Get ready Bobby.. Doug opens the door and jumps out ready to fight. From beneath the trailer, someone observes him... Doug bends down and discovers- GOGGLE'S SEVERED ARM. In its hand, the walkie-talkie still works. \nRADIO (O.S.) \"Goggle? Goggle?\" Doug grabs the radio. It's dripping with blood. Bobby is about to join him when Doug signals- \nTHERE'S SOMEONE HIDING UNDER THE TRAILER. Without a sound, Bobby aims the gun at the kitchen floor. Outside, Doug backs up to see who is hiding. Behind the step ladder, he sees an inert shape in the shadows. BANG! - Bobby shoots through the floor. Immediately, the shadowy figure jumps out into the light- \nDOUG Beast! The dog jumps into Doug's arms and begins licking his face. Bobby can't believe it, his dog has returned. Radio static comes back on the walkie. Bobby picks it up- \nRADIO (O.S.) \"Papa Jupe... Goggle is dead. I found him in the rocks...\" \"Dead?\" \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n85 CONTINUED: (5) 85 \nRADIO (O.S.) (CONT'D) \"They got him. He's all torn up...\" Bobby is proud of Beast. Still in the trailer, Brenda looks at them, not as hopeful. \nBOBBY Good boy.. That's a good dog. \nPAPA DUPE/RADIO (O.S.) \"I'm gonna take care of those bastards myself\"... Bobby exchanges a worried glance with Doug. Even though neither of the two has yet met Papa Jupe, something in his voice tells them that it's only going to get worse. Doug grabs the radio- \nDOUG (in the radio) \nWHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT? WHY ARE \nYOU DOING THIS TO US?! No answer. Just static. \nDOUG (CONT'D) \nANSWER ME! WHY US?! \n(IN DESPERATION) Give me back my little girl... Give her back to me... More static... \nDOUG (CONT'D) \nDO YOU HEAR ME?! Silence. Suddenly we hear- \n", "test2_true": "DOUG (CONT'D) How much ammo do you have left? \nBOBBY I don't know, half a clip? \nCUT TO: \n86 INT. DARK PLACE - NIGHT 86 \nOn a dimly lit wooden table, Catherine lays, wrapped in a blanket. A butcher's knife is planted next to her... Asthmatic breathing, and the sound of running water punctuate the silence. Ruby steps out of the darkness and moves towards the baby. She watches through her abnormally large eyes and extends her stringy fingers to touch the baby. A large screen splits the room in two. A strangely shaped shadow moves behind the screen: A HANDICAPPED BODY washed by A LARGE WOMAN... An empty wheel chair rests in a corner. Amused, Ruby looks at the baby who smiles back. She carefully takes Catherine in her arms when the invalid's voice \nINTERRUPTS- \nLARGE WOMAN (O.S.) Put that down Ruby... You know better than to play with your food... Ruby takes a step back, hugging the baby tighter. \n- RUBY Mama, pleaaase... \nHANDICAPPED (O.S.) (weak asthmatic voice) Listen to your mother Ruby and put that baby down... Now! Frightened, Ruby obeys and quickly runs out of the room. The baby starts crying... \nCUT TO: \n87 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 87 \nBrenda sits by the C/B and retries the SOS calls. \n(CONTINUED) \n87 CONTINUED: 87 \nBRENDA Mayday... Mayday... We need help ..Mayday... Mayday... can anybody hear me? Something has gone off in her eyes. She is absent, no longer living, just surviving. Doug is about to leave, taking with him anything from the trailer which might be useful. \nBASEBALL BAT, FLASHLIGHT, PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER... \nBOBBY Let me go with you. \nDOUG No, you stay here with your sister and stay by the radio. Somebody's bound to hear us. Brenda continues her distress call. \nBRENDA Mayday...mayday... Can anybody hear me? \nDOUG \n(TO BOBBY) The sun'll be up soon. One of them is hurt, I'm going to follow his trail through the hills. Bobby pulls out the 9mm gun and hands it to him. \nDOUG (CONT'D) No. You keep it in case they come back. \nBOBBY What about you? \nDOUG Don't worry about me, I'll take Beast. Beast sits at his feet ready to go. Doug straps the walkie- talkie over his shoulder. \nBOBBY Doug? \n(CONTINUED) \n87 CONTINUED: (2) 87 \nDOUG Yes? \nBOBBY I... I didn't mean what I said... Doug hugs him like a brother. Before walking out, he bends down to Lynn's body and kisses her one last time on the mouth. \n", "test2_id": 1669, "test3_input": "DOUG I'm going to find.our baby my love...I promise. \nCUT TO: \n88 EXT. HILLS - SUNRISE 88 \nThe first sign of dawn lights the distant horizon. The vultures perched on a dead Joshua Tree swivel their heads around, to see a distant, running FIGURE - DOUG AND BEAST, moving steadily among the rocks. \n89 EXT. MINE ENTRANCE - DAY 89 \nDoug and Beast arrive at the old mine's entrance on the side of the hill. The trail of blood leads inside. Doug hides behind a rock. Sweating, he catches his breath. Beast breathes heavily as well. Doug remembers what his wife always used to say- \nDOUG (to the dog) I told you to stop smoking. Doug sets a different frequency on his radio- \nDOUG (CONT'D) (Into the walkie) Bobby? Bobby? You read me? \nBOBBY (O.S.) Yeah, Doug... \nDOUG I followed the blood, I'm in front of a mine! \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n89 CONTINUED: 89 \nDOUG (CONT'D) I'm not sure if I'll get a signal from inside. If you don't hear from me in a half an hour, you're on your own. \n(A BEAT) Bobby? \nBOBBY Yeah... Good luck, Doug. He puts the walkie away and takes out the flashlight. \nDOUG \n(TO BEAST) You ready big guy? I hope you're not afraid of the dark. He pets the dog one final time and stands up. \n90 INT. MINE - DAY 90 \nWith the light from the entrance behind him, shadow enters the mine. The beam from his flashlight follows the trail of blood on the ground. The wooden pylons which have held up the walls for a hundred years threaten to crumble at any second. Only static on the radio. Doug turns it off. He moves further into the darkness, probing with his flashlight into the inky pit. Doug arrives at a fork splitting the tunnel off in two different directions. Doug lights each tunnel with the flashlight until he finds the one with-the blood trail, then continues on into that one. Tracking. Suddenly he stops. The beam of the flashlight has revealed TWO DOZEN PICKAXES that have been planted in the ground over mounds. That look very much like graves. The pickaxes look eerily like crosses, given the whole place the feel of A SUBTERRANEAN GRAVEYARD. Hanging from the graves, dates and portraits of all the miners who have died here, including women and children... The flashlight dims. Doug taps it to no avail. \n(CONTINUED) \n90 CONTINUED: 90 \nDOUG Come on. You can't be serious. Then light goes. completely off, leaving Doug in darkness. Scratch! - He lights a match. Holding the tiny flame, Doug continues down the tunnel until he arrives at another fork. He can no longer see the blood trail. \nA SHAPE SLIDES SWIFTLY BEHIND HIM! \nDOUG (CONT'D) (to Beast, meaning \nHIMSELF) Just stay calm, boy... A gust of air kills the match. He immediately lights another- Again, THE DRAFT SNUFFS IT OUT. He turns around, looking for the source of the air, and notices a reflection of light at the end of the tunnel. He moves towards the reflection. \n91 EST. MINE EXIT - DAY 91 On the other side of the hill, the collapsed wooden beams and stones block part of the mine's exit. Doug emerges with Beast. His eyes takes a moment to adapt to the bright sunlight. He. cannot believe what he sees. At the bottom of a hill, A \nSMALL TOWN - A CLASSIC ONE-STREET TOWN BUILT BACK IN THE \n50'S. Doug turns the walkie on. \nDOUG \n", "test3_true": "(CONTINUED) \n91 CONTINUED: 91 \nDOUG (CONT'D) Bobby, do you hear me? Bobby? Still nothing. Doug turns around and looks up- A wall of rock towers behind him. He tries one last time, but the signal won't go through. \n92 INT. TRAILER - DAY 92 \nClose up on the C/B radio in the trailer- Only static comes from the speakers. \n93 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 93 \nBrenda drags one of the tires from the SUV 30 feet away. She douses it with lighter fluid and- Whoosh! - a match sets it on fire creating a thick, black, smoke signal. Brenda joins her brother who is busy planting wooden stakes in a circle fifty meters around the trailer. \nBRENDA Maybe somebody heard our calls.. \nBOBBY Nobody's going to find us Brenda, even with that smoke...Nobody's coming._.. You heard what Doug said-We're alone now, just you and me. Let them come, I'm waiting for them. Now, Bobby stretches the nylon wire from the fishing pole around each stake. He sets the fishing pole next to the trailer, rigging to it one of Catherine's TOY SHAKERS- An improvised alarm system. \n94 EXT. HILLS - DAY 94 \nAt the summit, somebody observes the trailer and the thick cloud of smoke rising to the air. \nCUT TO: \n95 EXT. TOWN - DAY 95 \nDoug runs down the hills towards the town. Behind him, from the mouth of the mine, someone observes between the rocks- it's Ruby. Doug slows his pace as he enters Main Street. The town is deserted. No sign of life anywhere. All the houses and cars are covered with a thick layer of dust. Taking a closer look, he realizes all the parked cars are from the 50's. Uncertain, Doug walks through the ghost town, with Beast at his side... No movement besides the wind blowing and lifting an occasional cloud of dust. Doug walks up to a house and knocks on the front door. No one to open the door. Doug wipes one of the windows- It's too dark inside to see anything. The door is unlocked, Doug pushes it. It squeaks open. He hesitates before entering. \n96 INT. FIRST HOUSE - DAY 96 \nSunlight passes through the dusty windows revealing a living/dining room decorated from the 50's. Doug can't believe his eyes- Through the kitchen door, he can see a woman doing dishes. A man sits in the living room reading a newspaper. Children play in front of the blank TV set... \nTHESE ARE NOT REAL PEOPLE BUT MANNEQUINS! They have been dressed and placed into real life situations. \nTHE ATOMIC SYMBOL CAN BE FOUND ON EACH OF THEIR FOREHEADS. Doug spots a telephone behind the staircase and checks for a dial tone. Nothing. He picks up the phone casing. \nEMPTY. JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE HOUSE, IT'S FARE. \n97 EXT. TOWN - DAY 97 \nDoug quickly crosses Main Street to visit another house. \n98 INT. SECOND HOUSE - DAY 98 \nNew interior- New surreal setting. Around a table, a family of test dummies eat dinner. \n99 EXT. TOWN - DAY 99 \nStupefied, Doug enters yet another house. The door remains open as we see another family of dummies living a perfect little life. A LIFE WHICH STOPPED IN THE \nLATE 50'S... Around the corner of a house, a little girl dummy is sitting on a swing, her face half broken. A second later, Doug thinks he hears CHILDREN LAUGHING. He \nTURNS AROUND- Nothing but the wind blowing through the houses. Doug takes Catherine's bib from his pocket and lets Beast get its scent. \nDOUG Find her, Beast, find Catherine... With his nose to the ground, the dog pulls Doug straight ahead. Doug walks away through the streets, pulled by the dog. On the outskirts of town, we discover a fence buried in the sand. On it, an old metallic sign reads- \nTEST SITE 3B - MILITARY ZONE - HIGH RADIATION RISK The scent leads Doug into an alley off the main street. He sees an old generator on full throttle. A thick smoke pours from the exhaust. \n", "test3_id": 1670}

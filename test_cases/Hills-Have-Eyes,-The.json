{"train": "THE HILLS HAVE EYES \nWritten by \nAlexandre Aja & Gregory Levasseur \nBased on the original film by Wes Craven \nFEB 14 05 \nEXT. DESERT HILLS - DAY \nOpen on a GEIGER COUNTER scanning over a rocky terrain. A SAND STORM blows over the landscape. We are lost somewhere in the middle of the New Mexico desert. According to the instrument, the area contains high levels of radiation... THREE MEN WEARING FULL ANTI-RADIATION SUITS have left their jeep behind to collect samples of contaminated rocks. Not at all worried or bothered by the dust storm or high winds, they walk towards the hills. The man holding the counter stops in his tracks - \nMAN 1 (loudly through the \nSTORM) \nALRIGHT, GUESS. \nMAN 2 \nI'D SAY 43.9? \nMAN 1 \nIT'S OVER 124.5! \nMAN 2 \nIT'S GOT TO BE OFF. \n(WALKING AWAY) \nTHAT'S THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE \nFALLOUT IN CHERNOBYL... \n- MAN 3 (following his colleague) \nYEAH. PROBABLY NEEDS SOME \nADJUSTMENT. \nMAN 2 \n...CAN'T TRUST THE DIGITAL ONES... \nMAN 1 \n(STANDING STILL) No...It's something else... It's like the radioactivity is moving around us. The numbers on the dial continue to fluctuate. Where is this intensity coming from? \n(CONTINUED) \n1 CONTINUED: 1 He turns around, seeing nothing but sand and rock through his mask. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, THE GEIGER COUNTER GETS \nLOUDER AS THE NUMBERS SKYROCKET. In confusion, he taps on the instrument attempting to stabilize it, but the radioactivity continues to climb... He looks up to the horizon obscured by the sand storm - still nothing in sight. He sighs. His colleague is probably right, the Geiger counter simply needs an adjustment... He turns it off when A MAN COVERED WITH BLOOD, HALF NAKED, comes out of nowhere and jumps at his face- \nMAN \nBRENDA Bobby, come look at this. Bobby joins her. \nBRENDA (CONT'D) (holding the animal) Oh my god! Poor thing. \nBOBBY You two make a perfect pair. Bobby turns to a rusty car and unzips to urinate. \nBRENDA Don't pee there... \nBOBBY Why not? \nBRENDA (pointing to a small \nWOODEN OUTHOUSE) Hello? \nBOBBY God, what do you care? Bobby re-zips and heads towards the small wooden outhouse while Brenda plays with the baby pig. \nBRENDA Piggy, piggy, piggy... \nSOMEONE OBSERVES HER FROM THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE. \n12 EXT. CAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 12 \nIn front of the gas station, Lynn leans on the car giving Catherine a bottle. Big Bob opens the hood while the old man continues to fill the tank. At the same time, Doug comes out of the trailer holding his cell phone. \nDOUG (to the old man) Excuse me sir, do you have a phone I can use? I can't get a signal around here and... Big Bob interrupts. \nBIG BOB Give. the phone a rest, Bukowski! \nDOUG Sorry Bob, \"duty calls\"... \nLYNN Honey, you haven't put that phone down since we left. \nDOUG This is why I don't go on vacation. They're lost without me. \nBIG BOB Stop being at everyone's beck and call, Bukowski. You're the boss, remember? \nETHEL .I'm sure all that important business can wait till next week. Doug gives up. He kisses Lynn and takes the baby from her. \nLYNN \n(TO DOUG) Are you wearing sunblock? The sun's so strong. \n13 INT. SUV - DAY 13 \nWhile they are talking outside, a DEFORMED HAND slides into the back window of the SUV. \nA HAND WITH ONLY THREE STRANGELY PROPORTIONED FINGERS. It moves slowly, snatching BOBBY'S HOODED SWEATER from the back seat. \nSMALL VOICE (O.S.) \n(WHISPERING) .Annnnaaaaau... Under the car the visitor's feet walk way. They are bare, dirty and covered with dust. \n14 INT. / EXT. OUTHOUSE - DAY 14 \nRays of light pass through the wooden planks. The outhouse is so dirty that Bobby is forced to hold his breath... An EYE peeks between the wooden planks! \nBOBBY JUMPS- \nBOBBY What the hell Brenda! The eye goes away... He re-zips looking outside. Nobody. When he exits, Brenda appears on the other side. \nTHE WATER! Big Bob walks to the old man. \nBIG BOB What do -I owe you? The old man looks at the gas pump. \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT 36 dollars... \nDOUG Let me pay, Bob. \nBIG BOB \n(OFFENDED) Keep your money Bukowski, I can still afford.the gas! \nDOUG That's not what I meant... \n(CONTINUED) \n16 CONTINUED: 16 There is another room behind the counter, and the beaded curtain which separates the two rooms is still moving. \nLYNN (CONT'D) Beauty? Come on, sweetie... No answer. Cautiously, Lynn moves through the store to the beaded curtains. Above the cash register, an old sepia photograph of a miner stares at her. \nLYNN (CONT'D) Beauty? Lynn goes into the other room. In the darkness, among the old empty bottles, she finds Beauty standing with her front legs on a window sill and barking to the backyard. Lynn looks outside- Nobody. Only the desert and hills. Inside the room, THE HALF OPEN EXPENSIVE LEATHER BAG laying alone on the table awakens her curiosity. As she goes to inspect it, she hears the SUV starting and Doug calling out- \nDOUG (O.S.) Honey!? We're leaving... Lynn grabs the dog by the collar. \nLYNN \n(NOT CONVINCED) Come on, Beauty. There's nothing here... She turns around and runs into- \nTHE OLD GAS STATION ATTENDANT, STARING AT HER. \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT May I help you miss? \nLYNN Sorry, our dog got out...She won't stay put... A car horn breaks the silence. \n(CONTINUED) \n16 CONTINUED: ( 2) \nDOUG (0.S.) Honey? What are you doing?! \nLYNN \n(YELLING OUTSIDE) \nI'M COMING! The old man lets her pass with the dog, watching her WITH SUSPICION- Has she seen the contents of the bag? \n17 EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 17 \nThrough the gas station window, we see Lynn leaving with the dog. Outside, next to the rusty abandoned cars, THE PIGLET HAS DISAPPEARED. Only the rope remains. \nA MURMUR IS HEARD AS A SHADOW PASSES SLYLY ON THE FLOOR. \n18 EXT. GAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 18 \nLynn puts the dog in the trailer where Doug and Bobby are. She enters the SUV. Behind the wheel, Big Bob turns around one last time before driving off- \nBIG BOB Let's go! KNOCK KNOCK The old man knocks on the window. Big Bob opens- \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT \n21 CONTINUED: 21 Bobby sets down the screwdriver under the sleeper and sits next to the dogs. Doug grabs a cigarette. \nBOBBY I thought you stopped smoking? \n(NO ANSWER) Does my sister know? \nDOUG (lighting it with a \nSMILE) Fuck her! \nBOBBY \n(TEASING) Big Bob would kill you if he knew you were smoking in his \"88 Airstream\"... \nDOUG \n(PLAYING BACK) Fuck him too. You want one? Doug extends the pack. Bobby hesitates before reaching for one, but Doug pulls the pack away at the last moment. \nDOUG (CONT'D) Yeah right, if you start smoking your sister would cut my nuts off. \nBOBBY (after a pause) It's cool that you came with us. It's a drag when it's just us and our parents... \nDOUG Hey, I like seeing your parents... Bobby is surprised. \nDOUG (CONT'D) .in pictures! \n22 EXT. SW/ HILL ROAD - DAY 22 \nUnder a \"too perfect\" blue sky, the Carter vehicles pass through the barren landscape, lifting a cloud of dust. \nETHEL (O.S.) I think we're somewhere on this blue road... \n(CONTINUED) \n22 CONTINUED: 22 \nLYNN (O.S.) Mom, we're not on the blue road or any other road. He said it wasn't on the map, remember? In the distance, A LIZARD moves through some rocks before heading across the road unconcerned by the approaching car. \nBRENDA (O.S.) Dad, you shouldn't have listened to that guy. We're lost. \nBIG BOB (O.S.) Look how beautiful it is here girls... The hills, the colors... It's amazing. Imagine the first people who crossed this desert. They had no idea where they were going. \nBRENDA Neither do we, Dad. On the road, the Lizard continues carving a dusty path. \n23 INT. SUV - DAY / INTERCUT WITH THE LIZARD 23 \nClose up on the radio dial moving back and forth unsuccessfully in search of air waves... In the back seat, Brenda, annoyed, sits staring at the passing scenery. \nETHEL Don't drive so fast Bob, you might lose the camper... \nBRENDA \n(TO HERSELF) .this is fucked... \nETHEL Hey... Watch your mouth, young lady. (to her husband) Will you please back me up here? \nLYNN (calming things down) Relax, Mom. We're all just tired. \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUG 97% nationwide coverage, and we have to find ourselves in that \nHe searches desperately for a signal, extending his arm forward. Lynn grabs him tenderly by the waist. \nDOUG (CONT'D) (staring to the lifeless \nHORIZON) Your father wanted to see the desert... \nLYNN Doug... \nDOUG I hope he's enjoying himself. On his knees, by the SUV tires, Big Bob inspects under the vehicle... Not only are the tires flattened, but the front axel has buckled from hitting the rocks. \nBIG BOB \n(TO ETHEL) How am I supposed to drive with you talking my ear off? I'm pulling a trailer on a dirt road and it's 200 degrees out here! Behind him, Ethel walks with the baby who has stopped crying. \nETHEL Oh, so now it's my fault? Doug joins them. \nDOUG So what's the damage, General? \n(CONTINUED) \n25 CONTINUED: (2) 25 \nBIG BOB The damn axel is broken... \nDOUG Can we fix it? \nBIG BOB With what? The frame is completely twisted... Give me your phone, I'm gonna call a tow truck... \nDOUG I already tried. I'm not getting a signal. \nETHEL Can we use the C/B? \nBIG BOB That old thing? Give it a try, but this is mining country. Whatever metal is left in those hills will probably scramble the signal... \nDOUG What are we going to do? Without answering, Big Bob gets back on his feet, wipes his hands and grabs a bottle of water from the car. After a long \nDRINK- \nBIG BOB We're going to walk, that's what... \nDOUG Walk?! But we're miles from \nANYWHERE- \nBIG BOB (cutting him off) So we wait here for someone to drive by? Have you seen a car in the last three hours?! \n26 EXT. BOULDERS - DAY 26 \nA hundred yards away, Bobby has come to retrieve the dogs. Beauty and Beast have stopped below a boulder extending twenty feet high. They bark and growl towards the top. \n(CONTINUED) \n29 CONTINUED: 29 \nFURTHER AWAY- \nETHEL I bet this desert is full of rattlesnakes... \n31 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 31 \nOutside, Doug and Big Bob look at the road map laid out on the ground. \nDOUG I'll keep walking north. This road's gotta lead somewhere. Lynn comes around with the jacket and sees Big Bob and Bobby both holding guns. \nLYNN What are you going to do with those? \nBIG BOB It's always good to be prepared. Right? \n(CONTINUED) \n31 CONTINUED: \nLYNN \n(TO DOUG) Are you taking a gun too? Big Bob answers for him. \nBIG BOB We've only got two and it's better if you guys have one here. You never know. \nLYNN Are you sure you're going to be alright? Lynn puts a fisherman's hat on Doug to protect him from the sun and kisses him tenderly. \nBIG BOB If you don't find any help in six or seven miles come back. I'll go to the gas station... \nETHEL It's almost 3, you'll never be back before sunset. \nBIG BOB It's only about ten miles from here. I'll borrow that crazy old man's truck and use his phone if he has one... Don't worry... I'll be back with a tow truck before nightfall. \nBOBBY Can I go with Doug? \nBIG BOB No. Stay here with your mother and sisters. \n(TO BRENDA) And you, don't tease your brother, he's in charge now. Holding the gun, Bobby winks at his sister who continues to sunbathe. \nBRENDA Yeah, right. Ethel remains silent and worried. \n(CONTINUED) \n31 CONTINUED: (2) 31 \nETHEL We should pray before you go- \nBRENDA Oh please! \nETHEL Is it really too much to ask? (turning to her husband) Bob? Bob finally agrees, and like a good family man, he gathers them around. Brenda slips on her shirt and joins them. \nBRENDA \n(GRUMPILY) Thank God nobody's watching us. In a lowered voice, Ethel recites a prayer. Even though only Ethel takes it seriously, in that precise moment the arguing stops and the family seems united and strong. But seen from the surrounding summit, through Goggle's binoculars, the family looks small and vulnerable... Behind them the sun begins to descend. \nDOUG HEADS NORTHBOUND ON THE DIRT ROAD, WHILE BIG BOB BEGINS \nHIS JOURNEY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. \n32 INT. TRAILER - LATER 32 \nCatherine wakes up crying in her crib. \nLYNN Hey, little princess. Who doesn't want to sleep anymore? The baby looks at her mother, appeased. \nLYNN Why are the dogs so excited? \nETHEL Probably some rattlesnakes not far away. \nBOBBY \n(JOKINGLY) You know how Freud would've interpreted your obsession with rattlesnakes Mom? Ethel throws her kitchen towel at him. They laugh. A beat, then Ethel becomes sentimental. \nETHEL Brenda's going off to college. And then, next year, it's Bobby's turn... The house is going to feel so empty... Lynn grabs her mother's hand- \nETHEL (CONT'D) I'm really happy that we're all together on this trip. Brenda moves to the trailer. Beauty is still barking inside. \nBRENDA That makes one of us. They glare at her as she opens the door. \nBOBBY Brenda, the dogs! Too late. Beauty runs out in the direction of the hills Bobby drops his plate and gives chase. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) Dam\u00c2\u00a2nit, Brenda! Beauty! Worried, Ethel watches her son distance himself from the camper. \nETHEL \n(YELLING) Bobby, come back! \n35 EXT. HILLS - DAY 35 \nBeauty escapes to the hills. Bobby runs as fast as he can but cannot keep up. The dog gets further and further away, climbing up the side of the mountain. Beauty moves through the first series of rocks. Bobby loses sight of her and stops. Out of breath, he hesitates- Ahead, the rocky horizon shows no indication of a definite path. He spots Beauty climbing between some rocks and continues his chase. \nBOBBY \nBEAUTY! At the bottom of the hill, the rocks are too jagged for him to continue running. He slows down and begins moving past the first set of rocks. With much more agility, Beauty climbs quickly towards the top, disappearing behind some rocks. \nBOBBY (CONT-D) \nBEAUTY? BEAUTY? Nothing. Only sharp rocks stand before him. \nSUDDENLY, A HIGH PITCHED HOWLING SOUND TEARS THROUGH THE \nSILENCE AND ECHOES IN THE VALLEY. Bobby freezes. No doubt about it - Beauty found what she was looking for, and it was much stronger... In the distance, Bobby hears his mother calling. \n36 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 36 \nA few feet from the trailer- \nETHEL \nBOB-BY?! BOB-BY!? Overcome with worry, she turns to her two daughters. \n(CONTINUED) \n36 CONTINUED: 36 \nETHEL (CONT'D) You think he can hear me? \nLYNN I don't know, Mom. \nETHEL She couldn't have gone that far. Brenda notices the revolver on the table. Bobby is unarmed. \nETHEL (CONT'D) (back to the hills) \nBOB-BY?! \nMINES\" \"Military destroys miner's town.\" The old man's family was. one of those families whose genetic lineage was forever changed by the nuclear fallout. Big Bob is shocked, never believing such a thing was possible. \nA COUPLE OF MORE RECENT ARTICLES MENTION PEOPLE DISAPPEARING \nIN THE REGION. \nBIG BOB (CONT'D) You son of a bitch... Worried for his own family, he grabs the keys and walks out. From the bedroom window, we see him running to the pick-up truck. \n44 INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 44 \nBig Bob slams the door, starts the engine and turns on the headlights. The headlights shine on the outhouse. The wooden outhouse door slams back and forth in the wind. Something blocks it from shutting completely- \n(CONTINUED) \n44 CONTINUED: 44 \nA FOOT STICKS OUT... Big Bob exits the vehicle holding his gun and approaches. A voice comes to him. A MAN SOBBING- \nMAN (O.S.) (through his tears) \nJUPITER! I GOT BUCKSHOT... YOU \nHEAR? \nBIG BOB \n(MOVING SLOWLY) \nIS THAT YOU MISTER? Big Bob kicks open the door revealing- \nTHE OLD GAS STATION ATTENDANT, IN TEARS, HOLDING HIS SHOTGUN \nTIGHTLY, READY TO SHOOT AT ANYTHING... HE'S OBVIOUSLY DRUNK. \nBIG BOB (CONT'D) (aiming his gun at him) \nPUT THAT WEAPON DOWN RIGHT NOW \nMISTER! The old man seems mad. \nBIG BOB (CONT'D) \nI SAID PUT THAT WEAPON DOWN! \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT (lifting his eyes to Big \nBOB) My wife... She didn't want to leave ...she wouldn't move to town even when the state police ordered us to. The kids grew up in the mines... Like animals... (smiling through his \nTEARS) What kind of place is that for children? In a split second, the old man sets the shotgun under his \nCHIN- \nBIG BOB \nFREEZE! \nBANG! - THE OLD MAN'S BRAINS SPLATTER IN THE OUTHOUSE... \n(CONTINUED) \nLynn's distress call is heard from the trailer isolated in the middle of the desert. \n51 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 51 \nLYNN Mayday. . .We're stranded in the desert, we need help...mayday... Suddenly, the light on the C/B turns green and static can be heard. Ethel grabs her daughter's hand, hopeful that someone may have heard them. A second later, HEAVY BREATHING is heard over the radio. The light turns off. The two women look at each other in confusion. \nLYNN (CONT'D) What was that? \nETHEL It sounded like an animal... Lynn stands up worried. \nLYNN If animals start answering our radio calls, we're really fucked! \nETHEL Watch your language! \nLYNN Give it a rest, Mom. We have more important things to worry about. She walks out. \nETHEL Lynn, wait. Ethel stays alone with the baby. \n52 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 52 \nStill tied to the trailer, Beast growls and pulls on his chain. Lynn raises the collar of her jacket to protect herself from the wind and moves closer to the fire. \nLYNN Brenda? No answer. \nLYNN (CONT'D) \n(LOUDER) \nBRENDA?! In the distance, we see Brenda looking for her brother. \nBRENDA \nBOBBY? BOBBY? With a flashlight in one hand, the gun in the other, and a blanket over her shoulders, Brenda moves through the night. \nBRENDA (CONT'D) \nBOBBY? BOB-BY? She hears her older sister calling. \nLYNN (O.S.) Brenda? Brenda? \nBRENDA I'm here! I'll be back in a minute. The flashlight partially lights the desert as she disappears into the night. \nBRENDA (CONT'D) \nBOBBY? BOB-BY? \n53 EXT. HILLS - NIGHT 53 \nWe fly over the hills before stopping over Bobby's unconscious body laid out between two rocks. Ruby is still at his side, observing him silently. She hears Brenda's calls and runs away. \n(CONTINUED) \n53 CONTINUED: 53 Bobby slowly opens an eye, regaining his senses. Blood has coagulated on his face. He turns his head in the direction of his sister's voice, realizing that it's night. How long has he been unconscious? \nCUT TO: \n54 EXT. TRAILER - MIGHT 54 \nThe sky is so clear that you can see the milky way above the Carters' trailer home. Beast strains on his chain, a low growl of rage coming from his chest. \nDOUG No. The road just stops there. I hope your dad has better luck. Is there anything to eat? I'm starving. \nLYNN Let's go, it's freezing out here. Doug follows Lynn inside the trailer. \n(CONTINUED) \n55 CONTINUED: (3) 55 Bobby stays outside, worried. Everything seems calm. Perhaps too calm. He looks around- BEAST IS GONE. He finds the BROKEN CHAIN. \nCUT TO: \n57 EXT. ROCKY LABYRINTH - NIGHT 57 \nAt the top of the hill, Beast has found what's left of Beauty's mutilated body and whines as he licks her face. \nCUT TO: \n58 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 58 \nFrom outside we see Doug and Lynn finishing dinner while Brenda clears the table. Doug holds Catherine on his knees. Outside, Bobby stands guard with the gun. His mother comes out. \nETHEL Looks like we're camping out tonight. How's your head? Bobby doesn't answer. \nETHEL (CONT'D) Bobby? What's going on? A beat. \nBOBBY Nothing, Mom. \nETHEL Are you sure? \nBOBBY I'll feel a lot better when dad gets back. \nETHEL Me too, honey. Come inside. You've already spent enough time in the cold for one day, don't you think? \n(CONTINUED) \n58 CONTINUED: 58 Bobby agrees to follow his mother, abandoning the fire. The flames dance with the desert wind in the night. \n59 INT. TRAILER.- NIGHT 59 \nBobby double bolts the lock on the door. Behind him, Lynn comes out of the bathroom, while Doug has just changed Catherine. \nLYNN Don't close the door, we're leaving in a second! \nBOBBY \n(WORRIED) Where are you going? You don't want to wait until Dad comes back? \nDOUG I'm tired, I really need to rest for an hour or so... \nBOBBY We can squeeze in here. You'll be more comfortable. \nDOUG You want us to sleep on the floor?! Doug kisses Catherine and hands her to Brenda so she can put her to bed. Bobby takes him aside. \nBOBBY \n(QUIETLY) I need to talk to you... \nDOUG What? Bobby hesitates to talk. \nDOUG (CONT'D) So, what Bobby? Lynn walks by- \nBOBBY Beast?! He grabs the gun and exits the trailer, leaving the door open. \n64 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 64 \nBobby moves into the night. Beast is still barking somewhere in the dark. As he passes the SUV, he overhears the moaning and heavy breathing coming from inside. His flashlight moves over the desert terrain and the occasional bush. He calls out to his dog, trying not to wake anyone. \n(CONTINUED) \n64 CONTINUED: 64 \nBOBBY Beast? Come on, boy. You hear me! Come on now. Bobby moves further from the trailer towards the barking. \nHIS FLASHLIGHT PASSES QUICKLY OVER A SHAPE HIDING IN THE \nBUSHES! Bobby shines the light on the bush and approaches- Nothing. It must have been his imagination. The barking becomes a ferocious growl. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) Beast? Beast? Its me. Come on... All of a sudden the growling becomes a \"mooing\" cow. Then a goat. Then a chicken. Terrified, Bobby turns around and runs back toward the SUV. \n65 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 65 \nIn the living room, Ethel sleeps. At the other end, Brenda turns under the sheets. The muted bass coming from the iPod drums on in the background. \nA GNARLED HAND ENTERS FRAME AND BRUSHES A STRAND OF HAIR FROM \nBRENDA'S FACE SO STEALTHILY THAT SHE DOESN'T EVEN STIR. \nIT'S PLUTO. THE DIVERSION OUTSIDE HAS ALLOWED HIM TO ENTER. He stands above Brenda watching her sleep, an innocent smile on his face. His hand softly grazes her hair as if she was a kitten, then pulls on the sheets to expose her body. Pluto covers her mouth, silencing her. BRENDA'S EYES OPEN \nWIDE. \n66 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 66 \nPanting and panicked, Bobby knocks on the SUV's tailgate window, interrupting Lynn and Doug. \nBOBBY Doug! Doug! Caught red-handed, Lynn dresses and Doug pulls up his pants. \n(CONTINUED) \n66 CONTINUED: 66 \nDOUG Damanit! What is it now? \nLYNN (through the window) What do you want, Bobby? \nBOBBY Come on, open up! Lynn opens the back window giving him a dirty look. \nLYNN This had better be important. Bobby is too scared to keep the truth hidden. He regains his calm before talking. \nBOBBY Something's going on around here. We're not alone. Exasperated, Lynn takes a deep breath, not taking him seriously. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) I know this sounds weird, but there are people living in those hills. \nLYNN Bobby... We're in the middle of nowhere. Believe me, no one could survive out here! \nBOBBY I saw them. And Beauty... \nDOUG Beauty what? \nBOBBY They cut out her insides. \n72 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 72 \nBack inside the trailer. \n(CONTINUED) \n72 CONTINUED: 72 With a wicked smile on his face, Lizard puts on Ethel's apron and places her flowery sun hat on his head. This disturbed mind takes pleasure in dressing up in \"Mama's clothes\"... Then, famished, he eats everything he can find in the trailer. Raw meat, fruit, potato chips... He washes it all down with milk, orange juice... His eyes stop on the bird cage. He smiles. Lizard moves closer, opens the cage and grabs one of the parrakeets. The small bird looks around in confusion. \nHE TEARS OFF ITS HEAD AND SQUEEZES THE BLOOD INTO HIS MOUTH! Blood drips on his chin. Brenda's muted screams attract his attention. Lizard walks across the trailer. HE WANTS HIS SHARE. He pushes Pluto violently to the ground. \nLIZARD Move! (with a smile) You gotta be a man to do that... Pluto is outraged and tries to stand up. He wants to talk but no words come out. JUST GRUNTS AND GROWLS. Lizard savagely hits him several times. Behind them, terrified, Brenda watches helplessly as they fight. Lizard puts his foot on Pluto's face, pinning him to the ground, and then points the gun to his head. \nLIZARD (CONT'D) I told ya to move! Pluto moves away and, in a fit of rage, breaks everything in the trailer. Dishes, chairs, table... everything. Lizard laughs like a goon. He grabs Brenda by her feet and pulls her to him. \n(CONTINUED) \n72 CONTINUED: (2) 72 Excited and amused at the same time, he stares at Brenda's appetizing calf muscle. He smells it, licks it, and then, without hesitation, plunges his teeth into her leg. \n73 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 73 \nBrenda's muted screams are heard from inside the trailer. \n74 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 74 \nThe flames have been replaced by white smoke. Doug unties Big Bob. His body falls motionless to the ground. \nCOMPLETELY CARBONIZED, HE HAS STOPPED BREATHING. Smoke comes out of his mouth. Doug uses the blanket to extinguish the last flames. Behind Doug, Ethel looks at her husband refusing to accept the truth. \nETHEL No..No.. It's not possible. That's not Bob. That's not my Bob. She grabs Doug by his shirt trying to convince him. \nETHEL (CONT'D) Doug.. It's not him. Tell me it's not him. It's not my Bob! The poor woman has lost her mind. Ethel erupts in laughter pointing to her dead husband. \nETHEL (CONT'D) \n(HYSTERICALLY) That is not my Bob! That is not my Bob! That's not him! Lynn and Bobby are paralyzed. Doug turns to his wife. \nDOUG Take your mother away from here! With her eyes fixed on her father, Lynn walks her mother away. In Bobby's eyes, sadness has been replaced by hatred. Full of rage, the youngster grabs the gun and walks away. \n(CONTINUED) \n74 CONTINUED: 74 \nDOUG (CONT'D) Where are you going? Bobby? \nBOBBY I'm gonna take care of the motherfuckers! \nDOUG Come back here, Bobby! Bobby disappears into the night. Doug covers Big Bob's face with a blanket. \n75 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 75 \nReturning to the trailer, Lynn struggles to restrain Ethel. Ethel finally realizes it's too late for her husband and collapses into her daughter's arms. Just then, a muffled scream from Brenda pierces the night. \nLYNN Oh my god! Lynn runs inside leaving her mother alone. \n76 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 76 \nBursting into the trailer, Lynn stops on a dime when she sees Lizard, in Ethel's clothes, holding the baby. Behind him, Pluto restrains Brenda. Lizard walks up with the baby. \nLIZARD \n(HYSTERICAL) He swore he'd come back to get me. He swore it. Don't let him take me, Bobby! Outside, another noise, AND A SHADOW PASSES BACKLIT BY THE \nCAMPFIRE! \nBRENDA (CONT'D) \n(TERRIFIED) \nTHEY'RE HERE... THEY'RE BACK... I \nDON'T WANT TO DIE BOBBY...I DON'T \nWANT TO DIE...DO SOMETHING... Bobby picks up the gun- BANG! BANG! BANG! - With no hesitation, he shoots through the door. Brenda throws herself into Doug's arms. Bobby stares at the bullet holes in the trailer door. Suddenly, the sound of a radio is heard- \nRADIO (O.S.) \"Goggle, you copy? Goggle...\" Bobby and Doug look at each other confused. \n(CONTINUED) \n/\u00cf\u00bf\u00bd 85 CONTINUED: (4) 85 \nRADIO (O.S.) (CONT'D) \"Goggle?\" Doug silently moves closer to the door. From outside we can see Doug's eye through one of the bullet holes. Nobody, everything seems quiet. \nDOUG Get ready Bobby.. Doug opens the door and jumps out ready to fight. From beneath the trailer, someone observes him... Doug bends down and discovers- GOGGLE'S SEVERED ARM. In its hand, the walkie-talkie still works. \nRADIO (O.S.) \"Goggle? Goggle?\" Doug grabs the radio. It's dripping with blood. Bobby is about to join him when Doug signals- \nTHERE'S SOMEONE HIDING UNDER THE TRAILER. Without a sound, Bobby aims the gun at the kitchen floor. Outside, Doug backs up to see who is hiding. Behind the step ladder, he sees an inert shape in the shadows. BANG! - Bobby shoots through the floor. Immediately, the shadowy figure jumps out into the light- \nDOUG Beast! The dog jumps into Doug's arms and begins licking his face. Bobby can't believe it, his dog has returned. Radio static comes back on the walkie. Bobby picks it up- \nRADIO (O.S.) \"Papa Jupe... Goggle is dead. I found him in the rocks...\" \"Dead?\" \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n85 CONTINUED: (5) 85 \nRADIO (O.S.) (CONT'D) \"They got him. He's all torn up...\" Bobby is proud of Beast. Still in the trailer, Brenda looks at them, not as hopeful. \nBOBBY Good boy.. That's a good dog. \nPAPA DUPE/RADIO (O.S.) \"I'm gonna take care of those bastards myself\"... Bobby exchanges a worried glance with Doug. Even though neither of the two has yet met Papa Jupe, something in his voice tells them that it's only going to get worse. Doug grabs the radio- \nDOUG (in the radio) \nWHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT? WHY ARE \nYOU DOING THIS TO US?! No answer. Just static. \nDOUG (CONT'D) \nANSWER ME! WHY US?! \n(IN DESPERATION) Give me back my little girl... Give her back to me... More static... \nDOUG (CONT'D) \nDO YOU HEAR ME?! Silence. Suddenly we hear- \nDOUG I'm going to find.our baby my love...I promise. \nCUT TO: \n88 EXT. HILLS - SUNRISE 88 \nThe first sign of dawn lights the distant horizon. The vultures perched on a dead Joshua Tree swivel their heads around, to see a distant, running FIGURE - DOUG AND BEAST, moving steadily among the rocks. \n89 EXT. MINE ENTRANCE - DAY 89 \nDoug and Beast arrive at the old mine's entrance on the side of the hill. The trail of blood leads inside. Doug hides behind a rock. Sweating, he catches his breath. Beast breathes heavily as well. Doug remembers what his wife always used to say- \nDOUG (to the dog) I told you to stop smoking. Doug sets a different frequency on his radio- \nDOUG (CONT'D) (Into the walkie) Bobby? Bobby? You read me? \nBOBBY (O.S.) Yeah, Doug... \nDOUG I followed the blood, I'm in front of a mine! \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n89 CONTINUED: 89 \nDOUG (CONT'D) I'm not sure if I'll get a signal from inside. If you don't hear from me in a half an hour, you're on your own. \n(A BEAT) Bobby? \nBOBBY Yeah... Good luck, Doug. He puts the walkie away and takes out the flashlight. \nDOUG \n(TO BEAST) You ready big guy? I hope you're not afraid of the dark. He pets the dog one final time and stands up. \n90 INT. MINE - DAY 90 \nWith the light from the entrance behind him, shadow enters the mine. The beam from his flashlight follows the trail of blood on the ground. The wooden pylons which have held up the walls for a hundred years threaten to crumble at any second. Only static on the radio. Doug turns it off. He moves further into the darkness, probing with his flashlight into the inky pit. Doug arrives at a fork splitting the tunnel off in two different directions. Doug lights each tunnel with the flashlight until he finds the one with-the blood trail, then continues on into that one. Tracking. Suddenly he stops. The beam of the flashlight has revealed TWO DOZEN PICKAXES that have been planted in the ground over mounds. That look very much like graves. The pickaxes look eerily like crosses, given the whole place the feel of A SUBTERRANEAN GRAVEYARD. Hanging from the graves, dates and portraits of all the miners who have died here, including women and children... The flashlight dims. Doug taps it to no avail. \n(CONTINUED) \n90 CONTINUED: 90 \nDOUG Come on. You can't be serious. Then light goes. completely off, leaving Doug in darkness. Scratch! - He lights a match. Holding the tiny flame, Doug continues down the tunnel until he arrives at another fork. He can no longer see the blood trail. \nA SHAPE SLIDES SWIFTLY BEHIND HIM! \nDOUG (CONT'D) (to Beast, meaning \nHIMSELF) Just stay calm, boy... A gust of air kills the match. He immediately lights another- Again, THE DRAFT SNUFFS IT OUT. He turns around, looking for the source of the air, and notices a reflection of light at the end of the tunnel. He moves towards the reflection. \n91 EST. MINE EXIT - DAY 91 On the other side of the hill, the collapsed wooden beams and stones block part of the mine's exit. Doug emerges with Beast. His eyes takes a moment to adapt to the bright sunlight. He. cannot believe what he sees. At the bottom of a hill, A \nSMALL TOWN - A CLASSIC ONE-STREET TOWN BUILT BACK IN THE \n50'S. Doug turns the walkie on. \nDOUG \nSOMEONE LIVES HERE! His daughter could be there... \n(CONTINUED) \n99 CONTINUED: 99 Doug tries to see into the windows, but they are caked in filth. He decides to go around when- \nA MAN WALKS INTO VIEW WITHOUT SEEING HIM! Immediately, Doug backs away. The man drags a cadaver by its feet. Half of the dead body is missing, having apparently been torn off. Beast GROWLS. The man turns around, revealing his horrible face- A METALLIC BRACE is screwed on four sides of his head helping him stand straight. ENORMOUS CYSTS DISFIGURE HIM AND COVER EVERY VISIBLE PART OF HIS BODY. Let's call him \"CYST\". Cyst traces back his steps, trying to find what caused the noise. He holds the gas station attendant's shotgun! The alley is empty. The generators are still motoring. All seems normal. Cyst turns back towards main street. Cyst passes an old'parked car without seeing Doug and the dog hidden inside. Doug breathes a sigh of relief. Close call. Quietly, Doug gets out of the car. He hesitates as to whether he should bring Beast with him or to leave him in the car. The dog could be his best weapon but, on the other hand, he also represents a_bigger risk to be spotted. \nDOUG (CONT'D) \n(SOFTLY) You wait here Beast! Come on, sit!... Good boy. I'm gonna find Catherine... The dog is confused and whines through the half-opened window. \nDOUG (CONT'D) Shhhh... Quiet Beast... Don't move! I'll be back... He closes the car door and starts down the alley, lowering his head. \n(CONTINUED) \n99 CONTINUED: (2) 99 From inside the car, Beast watches Doug getting further away... Doug sneaks along the side of the building towards the front door. He hesitates, unsure of what awaits him inside- \n102 INT. HOUSE - DAY 102 \nDoug crosses a doorway without making a sound. He enters the front hall squeezing the bat in his hands. Something in the air, A DISGUSTING SMELL, catches his attention. Doug moves slowly and discovers, in the dining room, sitting amongst the dummies- \nBIG BOB'S CHARRED BODY! His father-in-law's arms have been torn off and devoured. THE AMERICAN FLAG that used to adorn his SUV is planted THROUGH \nHIS FOREHEAD! Doug approaches terrified. \nBEHIND HIM A WEAK AND ASTHMATIC VOICE BEGINS TO SING THE \nNATIONAL ANTHEM- \nVOICE (O.S.) \"Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?\" Doug jumps and quickly lifts the baseball bat, ready to swing. Nobody. Just the fake living room filled with inert dummies. No trace of his baby. An electrical fan turns in a corner, close to a shelve full of old books... Doug moves forward, gripping the bat tightly. \nVOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) (feeble and asthmatic) \"...Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight...\" He can hear his own heart beat as he searches through the house. In another room, close to the window and in the shadows, he sees someone sitting in a wheelchair. \n(CONTINUED) \n102 CONTINUED: 102 \nVOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) \"...And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air...\" Doug gets closer- A ray of light shines on the skull of whoever sits in the wheel chair. The wheel chair moves forward revealing a most horrific sight- BIG BRAIN - We recognize the handicapped man whom we have seen before, bathing behind the screen. Big Brain's body is skeletal. He was born with a genetic disease giving him a head ten times bigger than his face. A head so heavy, he is unable to hold it up. It rests back on his chair, forcing him to stretch his eyes to see from side to side. Big Brain is maybe the most representative character of the damage done by nuclear fallout in this area. Doug threatens him with the baseball bat- \nDOUG Where's my baby! Where's Catherine?! Big Brain does not answer. \nDOUG (CONT'D) What did you do with her? \nBIG BRAIN \n(MURMURING) ..Nothing.. Doug is beyond his breaking point - \nDOUG Where is she then? ANSWER ME! He raises the bat. \nBIG BRAIN (weak and asthmatic) .I don't know where she is. I never leave this place... Big Brain moves away from the window wheeling himself to the couch. His hands are thin and pale, like a child's. \n(CONTINUED) \n102 CONTINUED: (2) 102 \nBIG BRAIN (CONT'D) ..You should've read the signs before taking that road... \nDOUG What signs?! \nSUDDENLY- Doug stops crying_instantly, it was a trick! He turns the screwdriver around and slams it into Pluto's foot. The screwdriver goes through the shoe nailing Pluto to the floor. Pluto screams in pain. Doug rises and moves behind him. In a swift movement, Doug takes the American flag from Big Bob's forehead, stabbing Pluto in the back of the neck! \nOLD GLORY'S STAFF COMES THROUGH HIS THROAT ON THE OTHER SIDE. Pluto screams again, dropping the axe. Outraged, Pluto tears the flag from his neck and turns to Doug. \n(CONTINUED) \n104 CONTINUED: (3) 104 \nPLUTO STOPS- \nDOUG IS HOLDING THE AXE. The blade swings through the air and slams into Pluto's skull! Pluto's eyes freeze and his body falls to the ground, his skull half open. DOUG JUMPS ON TOP OF HIM. FULL OF RAGE, HE \nMUTILATES PLUTO WITH THE AXE TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION. Big Brain watches Pluto die without showing any emotion. Silence returns to the destroyed house. Doug tears off a piece of Pluto's shirt and uses it as a BANDAGE for his hand... He picks up his half broken shattered glasses on the floor and put them back. SLING! - Doug removes the bloody axe from the corpse. He turns to Big Brain, who backs off- \nBIG BRAIN The baby... the baby is in the last house on the left... \nCUT TO: \n105 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 105 \nThe back door to the SUV opens, revealing Bobby and Brenda carrying Lynn's body inside where Ethel's body has been moved. Not far from the car and above the fishing pole, Catherine's shaker remains still and silent... \n106 EXT. TOWN - DAY 106 \nStill imprisoned in the car, Beast barks, desperate to find a way out. A hundred yards away- Cyst crosses Main Street toward Big Brain's house still holding the shotgun. Through the broken door, Cyst spots Pluto in a pool of blood. Hatred fills his eyes as he loads the shotgun and prepares to shoot. \n(CONTINUED) \n106 CONTINUED: 106 He looks for Doug but sees no one. Cyst moves in between a few cars, failing to see Doug hiding behind one of them. Doug hits the man in his knee with the axe. HE SEVERS HALF OF HIS RIGHT LEG. Cyst screams in agony. In one swift move, Doug removes the axe from Cyst's kneecap swinging it into his back. Cyst falls on the ground. The fall pushes the axe further into his back. Cyst reaches for the shotgun lost in his fall. Doug steps on his chest and pushes slowly- Crack - The axe finally hits the spine, killing him instantly. Doug picks up the shotgun. \n107 INT. HOUSE - DAY 107 \nFrom the broken window, Big Brain watches Doug walk away down Main Street. He picks up a walkie-talkie hidden in his \nWHEELCHAIR- \nBIG BRAIN Lizard... Kill the baby... \n108 INT. LIZARD'S HOUSE - DAY 108 \nLizard enters the house holding a MACHETE. The wound Lynn had given him before she died still bleeds through his improvised bandage. He moves to the kitchen with a limp. There, he comes face to face with Ruby. Behind her, the baby is wrapped inside a blanket on the table. The kitchen walls are covered with dry blood. Severed human remains are scattered about and hanging like slabs of meat. Ruby blocks his way- \nLIZARD Get out of the way Ruby... \n(CONTINUED) \n108 CONTINUED: 108 Ruby refuses to let him pass. Lizard lifts the machete threatening his little sister. \nLIZARD (CONT'D) \nI TOLD YOU TO MOVE. NOW MOVE! Scared, Ruby obeys and runs out the kitchen door. Lizard approaches the baby, who moves inside the blanket. \n109 INT. LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT- DAY 109 \nAt the same time, Doug arrives at the last house on the street. He looks for his baby in every part of the house. Nothing but dummies. Doug enters a room and sees a crib. \nDOUG Catherine?! He goes to the crib and discovers a plastic doll... \nBIG BRAIN LIED! \nFRENETICALLY. The fishing reel quickly unwinds... This time there is little room for doubt, even if all seems clear around the camper. \nBRENDA I don't.see anybody... What's happening? Bobby and Brenda leave their hiding place. They move, back to back, cautious... \nBRENDA (CONT'D) answer me, why isn't anyone there? I'm scared... \nBOBBY \n(LOW VOICE) Stay close Brenda. From inside the SW, we see the two adolescents getting further away when- \nA DARK FIGURE JUMPS IN THE FOREGROUND, IN FRONT OF THE \nWINDOW! \n(CONTINUED) \n116 CONTINUED: (2) 116 It's PAPA JUPITER. His long hair and thick beard cover everything except his determined and PSYCHOPATHIC EYES. Bobby and Brenda have arrived at the end of their security zone... \nBRENDA Look! Further ahead, on the ground, a tumbleweed is stuck on the fishing wire, moving it in the wind. \nBRENDA (CONT'D) Let's go back... Not convinced, Bobby agrees, but his face freezes when he turns back to see- THE BACK DOOR OF THE SUV, WIDE OPEN. At a loss, Bobby and Brenda return. \nTHEIR MOTHER'S BODY HAS BEEN REMOVED! \nBRENDA (CONT'D) \n(PANICKED) What happened? What happened Bobby? Where's mom? A trail of blood leads from the trailer to somewhere behind some rocks. \nBOBBY \n(TO BRENDA) He's over there. Get the trailer ready.._ The new \"visitor\" has brought the nightmare back to life in Brenda's eyes. She's paralyzed. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) Brenda? Come on? Brenda remains still. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) \nBRENDA?! Terrorized, Brenda backs up to the trailer, while her brother, with a determined look on his face, walks to the hills. \n117 INT. TRAILER - DAY 117 \nBrenda returns to the trailer where two propane tanks have been brought out from under the sink. Through the window, she watches her brother get further out. \n118 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 118 \nWhat Bobby discovers behind the rocks is beyond horrific- Kneeling next to his mother's corpse, Papa Jupiter devours her heart, tearing into it with his teeth. FEELING BOBBY'S \nPRESENCE, HE TURNS AROUND AND STARES AT THE YOUNG MAN WITH A \nSADISTIC SMILE. BLOOD DRIPS DOWN HIS BEARD. Bobby points his gun at him. Papa Jupiter stands and, in a fit of rage, charges at Bobby. Keeping his cool, Bobby fires- BANG! BANG! BANG! The bullets only slow him down. CLICK! The gun is empty. \n119 INT. TRAILER - DAY 119 \nBrenda opens the valves to the gas tanks. \n120 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 120 \n.Outside, Bobby throws the gun and runs to the trailer as fast as he can. _ Papa Jupiter is right behind him. He takes a SMALL PICKAXE from his belt and throws it at Bobby. \nTHE PICKAXE STICKS INTO THE TRAILER INCHES FROM BOBBY'S FACE! \n", "test1_input": "6 INT. GAS STATION - DAY 6 \nKRIIINK KRONK - The metal grinding noise increases as we move towards the gas station door. The door opens and the old man walks out holding his gun. Nobody. Silence has returned. The metal grinding is gone. The lever from the water well still moves. IT'S JUST BEEN \nUSED! Hidden behind the house someone or something observes the old station attendant walking slowly to the well. DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...- water falls on the palm of his hand. Worried, the old man scans the surroundings. \nHE IS NOT ALONE. \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT Ruby? Is that you?! Ruby? The sun is already high above, the heat waves shimmering over the desert. The old gas station attendant moves away from the road towards the hills. \n(CONTINUED) \n6 CONTINUED: He stops by a broken fence which is bent halfway to the ground. On a rusty sign next to an atomic symbol, we can \nREAD: \nMILITARY ZONE - NO TRESPASSING - RISK OF RADIATION \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT (CONT'D) (towards the hills) \nRUBY! RU-BY! On the side of the hill,-THE ENTRANCE TO A CONDEMNED \nNINETEENTH CENTURY MINE. He approaches the mine and looks through the wooden planks barring its entrance. \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT (CONT'D) \nRUBY? His echo is the only sound that can be heard from the depths... He aims the shotgun, ready to open fire. \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT (CONT'D) \nIF THAT'S YOU JUPITER, I GOT A \nBUCKSHOT FOR YA... YOU HEAR ME?! Behind the gas station, someone observes the old man coming back to the house. AN EXPENSIVE LEATHER BAG was placed in front of his door during his absence. The old man looks-around terrified. Diligently, he enters the house leaving the bag on the ground. On second thought, the door reopens and the bag is dragged inside. \n7 INT. GAS STATION - DAY 7 \nThe shutters are all closed leaving the station in darkness. The old man throws the leather bag on the dining table and sets down the shotgun. He takes a cigar from an ashtray and lights it. He grabs a whisky bottle. \n(CONTINUED) \n7 CONTINUED : 7 After a solid gulp, he turns on a bare light-bulb hanging over the table, and stares at the bag in silence. One more swig for courage, and the old man empties the bag on the \nTABLE- Jewels, a Swiss watch, a DV Cam, glasses, several cell phones, a pager, loose cash, credit cards, a wallet... \n.A FEW GOLD TEETH, AND AN EAR ON WHICH HANG GOLD EARRINGS. He grabs the wallet and pulls out a photo already sticking out. On the bent picture, we see a young couple kissing. The young woman wears the same earrings found on the severed ear... The old man heaves a sigh before putting the wad of cash in his pocket. Outside, a voice is heard. \nMAN (O.S.) \nSOMEONE THERE?! The voice is followed by a car horn. The old man quickly gathers the objects from the table returning them to the bag. \n8 EXT. GAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 8 \nA 1988 AIRSTREAM TRAILER HOME hitched to A CHEVROLET SUV is parked in front of the gas station. BIG BOB CARTER, an imposing man in his late fifties, stands outside the vehicle still honking the horn. The trailer home and SUV with the AMERICAN FLAG waving on the side, completes the image - Big Bob is an obvious cliche of the middle class Republican father with a touch of John Wayne. \nBIG BOB where the hell is everybody? I'm gonna... Before he can finish his sentence, the old gas station man appears. \nBIG BOB (CONT'D) Ah, there you are. Fill it up and check the fluids my friend. \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test1_true": "OLD GAS ATTENDANT California? Sure didn't take the fastest road! \nETHEL My crazy husband absolutely had to see the desert. \nOLD GAS ATTENDANT Nothing to see in the desert. Big Bob glares at the old man who fills up the tank while still chewing on his cigar. \nBIG BOB You know, it's illegal to smoke around a gas station. The old man bursts out in laughter revealing rotten teeth. \n9 INT. TRAILER - DAY 9 \nInside the trailer home, DOUG BUKOWSKI, 32, Lynn's husband, tries to fix the broken A/C. His glasses and white oxford shirt drenched in sweat, Doug is totally out of his element. This is a guy who has never been out of the city. Using a Phillips screwdriver, he forcibly removes the front grill to access the mechanism. The heat and incessant BARKING wear on Doug's nerves. \nDOUG Piece of shit! Why couldn't we fly like normal people? \nLYNN Relax Doug, please. It's their silver anniversary and they're so happy you're here. \nDOUG Please, your parents can't stand me. \nLYNN You're wrong. They love you. \n(CONTINUED) \n9 CONTINUED: 9 \nDOUG We could have taken them on a cruise. \nLYNN Yeah, that's a great idea. Why didn't you plan it? \nDOUG What's that supposed to mean? \nLYNN Never mind. Lynn grabs the milk bottle from its heater. \nDOUG Maybe I shouldn't have even come. \nLYNN Doug, please stop. I never ask you for anything, OK? (she looks at the baby) Well see how happy you are when Catherine comes along on our 25th anniversary. She walks out. \nDOUG \n(TO HIMSELF) It won't be in a shitty trailer home-that's for sure. \nLYNN (O.S.) I heard that... \n10 INT. SUV - DAY 10 \nIn the back seat, BRENDA, 17, sleeps against the window. A twig tickles her nose. Without opening her eyes, the young girl slaps her face as to chase away a fly. But the twig persists - It's her little brother, BOBBY, 15, teasing her. Linkin Park blasts through his iPod. Lynn knocks on the window, interrupting his little game. \n(CONTINUED) \n10 CONTINUED: 10 \nLYNN If you want to use the restroom, it's now or never.

He comes closer trying to make eye contact as she continues to murmur the same thing. She too is terrified- \nRUBY \n(SOFTLY) The hills... The hills have eyes...The hills have eyes...The hills have eyes... Behind him, a small rock slide grabs his attention. He turns his head. When he turns back to Ruby, she is gone. \nBOBBY Ruby, come back! Once more, Bobby is alone in the labyrinth. On the other side, he finds a trail of blood as if a body had been dragged on the rocks. The bloody trail is still fresh and disappears behind another set of rocks a few feet away. Bobby hesitates, unsure of what he might find... As soon as he's around the outcropping to the other side Bobby sees something that stops him dead in his tracks. Before him, on the ground, is Beauty. Dead. Disemboweled. Bobby drops to his knees, disbelieving, his face turning white. He touches the animal's head as if to convince himself that this nightmare can't be possible at all. Beauty's face is locked in a grimace of horrible pain and shock. And... the animal is missing its front right leg. DRIP... DRIP... DRIP... DROPS OF BLOOD fall on Bobby's hand - ABOVE HIM, PERCHED ON A ROCK, A FIGURE OBSERVES HIM. A man with an impressive build crouches like a monkey. He wears old clothes covered with dust, and a DERBY HAT on his head. Binoculars hang around his neck. \n(CONTINUED) \n38 CONTINUED: (4) 38 \nIT'S GOGGLE. Goggle has no face, as if it were totally covered with wax. He has two little holes for nostrils and no ears. His mouth is like an opened wound sliced in his skin. His eyes are the only features which give him any human resemblance at all. Using his hand, Goggle devours something ferociously- \nBEAUTY'S LEG! Terrified, Bobby runs away. Goggle laughs from his rock. Bobby jumps down the hill. From the summit, Goggle continues feasting. A few yards away, Ruby's slender silhouette slides between the rocks. Goggle stops eating, sees Ruby, and throws her the remains. Ruby looks at the half-eaten leg in disgust, and pushes it away. \nGOGGLE (O.S.) (rough and deep) What's the matter Ruby.. .You don't like dog anymore? \n39 EXT. HILLS - DAY 39 \nMoving at top speed, Bobby descends from the hills, occasionally glancing behind him. He jumps from one rock to the next. Anything to get out of this hellhole. He turns around one too many times and fails to see the sharp precipice ahead. He tries to stop, but it's too late. Bobby slides down a few feet before grabbing hold of a protruding rock. The rock tears his skin. Bobby tries to climb back up, losing his grip. He falls. His head hits the bottom. He loses consciousness. Behind him a RATTLESNAKE slithers rattling its tail. The snake zips its tongue around his face when - \nA WOODEN STICK WITH FORKED END, TRAPS THE SNARE'S HEAD TO THE \nGROUND SAVING BOBBY FROM A CERTAIN BITE. \n(CONTINUED) \n39 CONTINUED: 39 With the hood of the sweatshirt still over her head, RUBY WATCHES THE WOUNDED BOY TENDERLY with her big, abnormal eyes. \nCUT TO: \n40 EXT. ROAD - END OF THE DAY 40 \nClose on THE RED SUN on the horizon. We hear Doug, singing \"California Dreaming\" a capella. \nDOUG \"...All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray. I've been for a walk on a winter's day. I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A... California dreamin...\" After hours of walking down this road, his face shows signs of fatigue. \nDOUG (CONT'D) I was in LA._ California Dreamin...\" The lyrics resonate throughout the desert. Suddenly, he stops singing. \nDOUG (CONT'D) \n(TO HIMSELF) What the hell?! \nIN FRONT OF HIM, ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD, THE ROAD ENDS- A mound of earth blocks the road like a wall, extending hundreds of yards on either side. Confused, Doug approaches the wall and starts climbing. Reaching the top, he takes off his sun clips from his glasses and tries to grasp what's on the other side- A HUGE ATOMIC CRATER, three hundred yards in. diameter. \nTHE CRATER HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A GRAVEYARD FOR CARS, TRUCKS, \nTRAILER HOMES, MOTORCYCLES... Doug climbs down and wanders between the rusted vehicles. Doug lights a cigarette before continuing his inspection. \n(CONTINUED) \n40 CONTINUED: 40 In the reflection of a shattered rear view mirror, we see him approaching another car. Dust completely covers the windows. Doug wipes one down to \nLOOK INSIDE- He notices a baby seat still strapped to the back. The cars all seem to be in good condition, as if they were simply pushed into the crater. He leans down towards another car- Barbed wire is rolled around the flattened tires... As Doug looks around in confusion, trying to figure out what this place might be, THE CAMERA CRANES UP TO A WIDE AERIAL SHOT - revealing five or six others craters. \n41 EXT. TRAILER - MAGIC HOUR 41 \nIt's getting colder. Lynn warms her hands at a fire in front of the trailer.

GAS STATION - NIGHT 42 \nClouds pass, revealing an almost full moon. Wind blows around the dark gas station. Between the broken-down cars, we see Big Bob approaching on the road. A rusty tea pot sits on a pile of trash and whistles in the wind. By placing his hand on the spout, Big Bob stops the whistling and silence returns. Whistling. Silence. Whistling. Big Bob walks to the porch. \nBIG BOB \nHELLO! ANYONE HERE?! No answer. He knocks on the door. \nBIG BOB (CONT'D) It's Bob Carter, I got some gas from you a couple of hours ago. Still nothing. Big Bob draws his gun and opens the door when- \nSILENCE. From the other side of the house, the whistling has stopped. \nBIG BOB (CONT'D) Anybody there? Answer me! After a few seconds, the whistling returns. \n(CONTINUED) \n42 CONTINUED: 42 Big Bob shrugs it off and enters. \n43 INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 43 \nHolding his gun, Big Bob steps into the empty gas station store. A faint light comes from the back room. The wind blows dust through the broken windows... Vigilantly, he moves through the empty shelves, behind the counter and past the beaded curtain separating the two rooms. The light bulb above the dining table is on. \nBIG BOB Somebody home? Hello? Big Bob pushes the last door leading to the back room. His hand feels for the light switch. CLICK - an old lamp comes on in the corner. He finds a wall mounted phone and picks up the receiver. No tone. \nBIG BOB (CONT'D) \n(TO HIMSELF) Dammit... Through the window, Big Bob sees a pick-up truck. He starts searching for the keys. Going through the different rooms, he discovers a drawer full of money, jewels, watches, credit cards... A REAL FORTUNE. He spots a key chain hanging from a nail next to the desk. He reaches for the keys when something else grabs his attention- Partially hidden in the dark, he discovers a few family photos and a few newspaper clippings from the 1950s pinned to the wallpaper. Big Bob lights the desk lamp and turns it towards the wall- His face goes cold- On the aged photos, we recognize the old gas station attendant in his younger days, next to his wife and his \nCHILDREN- \n(CONTINUED) \n43 CONTINUED: 43 \nABNORMAL CHILDREN GRUESOME AND DEFORMED BY NATURE... Cleft lips, tumors, uneven extremities, malformations, skin diseases, and gangrene of the face... \nTHEY ARE ALL AFFECTED BY GENETIC ABNORMALITIES. On a more recent polaroid, we can recognize Ruby at 6 years old. Besides her three fingers and big eyes, half of her skull is missing or caved in. Another polaroid - in a wheelchair, a little boy has difficulty holding up his hugely disproportionate head.

His fingers graze her hair. \nSUDDENLY, LYNN'S BODY SUFFERS A LAST MUSCLE SPASM, LIKE A \nCIRCUIT SHORTING OUT. Doug tries to breathe life back into her body, but death has overtaken her open eyes. He closes them and starts weeping. The music from the Fisher Price mobile is the only other sound... Doug turns around. THE CRIB IS EMPTY... \nDOUG \n(SOFTLY) No...No... He squeezes his fist with rage. \n83 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 83 \nAt the foot of the burnt tree, Big Bob's body is laid out on some rocks, the blanket over his face. A few figures emerge out of the darkness and gather around the body like a pack of hyenas. \nBIG BOB IS DRAGGED AWAY THROUGH THE DUST... \nCUT TO: \n84 EXT. HILLS - NIGHT 84 \nBacklit by the moon, at the top of the hill, we find Goggle and his binoculars. Reflecting in the lenses, we see the carters' trailer glowing in the night. A rustling noise attracts his attention. \n(CONTINUED) \n84 CONTINUED: 84 Before Goggle can turn around, a wild animal jumps at his face- IT'S BEAST. The German shepherd tears at Goggle's face and locks deep into his throat. Goggle tries to fight it off, but the animal is determined to kill. Goggle grabs AN OLD RAZOR out of his pocket and tries to cut the animal. The dog bites down tightening its grip. BONES CRACK. He drops the razor. Goggle's derby hat falls between some rocks. \nBEAST AVENGES BEAUTY IN A BLOODFEST! Someone calls him on the on walkie-talkie- \nRADIO (O.S.) \"Goggle? Goggle...\" Goggle will not answer anymore... \n85 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 85 \nLaid out on the couch, Ethel agonizes between life and death. Brenda stares into space, saying nothing. Doug touches her head as he passes. Instinctively, she backs off terrified. Across the trailer, Bobby paces back and forth. \nBOBBY \n(PANICKED) What are we going to do Doug? What are we going to do if they come back? Completely defeated, Doug comes back and goes to Ethel's side. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) Doug! Doug does not answer and takes Ethel's hand. She opens her eyes and looks at him as if nothing happened. \nETHEL This camper's so small. No matter how much you clean, it's always a mess. \n(CONTINUED) \n85 CONTINUED: 85 Doug nods in silence. \nETHEL (CONT'D) Is Big Bob home? \nDOUG Not yet. \nETHEL Did everyone go to bed? \n", "test3_true": "ETHEL (short of breath) Is Lynn sleeping? Doug holds back the tears. \nDOUG Yes.. (after a beat) Do you need anything? Ethel finds it more and more difficult to talk. \nETHEL Look in the closet Doug, I'm sure I have another blanket. I'm so cold. Doug tucks one of the blankets around her. \nDOUG \n(REASSURING) There's one here. Nice and warm. \nETHEL You've always been so sweet. I understand why Lynn loves you so much. She raises her arm to caress his face. Her hand falls on the bed. Lifeless. Brenda screams, bursting into tears. \n(CONTINUED) \n85 CONTINUED: (2) 85 At the same time Bobby pounds his fist against a wall. His eyes full of hate, he joins Doug. \nBOBBY \n(DETERMINED) Come on! I'm not going to take this shit... Doug gets mad as well. \nDOUG \nDON'T BE STUPID! WE'RE NOT GOING \nANYWHERE, DO YOU HEAR ME? \nBOBBY Fine. You stay here. I'm going after them. Doug gets between Bobby and the door, preventing the kid from leaving. \nBOBBY (CONT'D) Let me go! \nDOUG You want to die, too? \nBOBBY I don't care. Doug drags him in front of his mother's body. \nDOUG Look! Look at what they did to your mother. Look at what they did to your sister. He slams Bobby against the door. \nDOUG (CONT'D) You're not a fucking child, alright? Think before you do something stupid. You won't make it three feet! We need a plan, OK? We need to think... \nBOBBY Think about what? They have Catherine, Doug... Doug remains silent... \n(CONTINUED) \n85 CONTINUED: ( 3) 85 \nBOBBY (CONT'D) THEY HAVE CATHERINE... You know what they could to do to her, and you're not going to stop them?! You're just a coward... Doug jumps back on Bobby grabbing him by the collar. \nDOUG \n(ENRAGED) \nSTOP IT! SHUT UP! JUST SHUT YOUR \nFUCKING MOUTH! \nA MUFFLED SOUND COMES FROM OUTSIDE! They all freeze. Doug releases Bobby and immediately turns off the light. Plunged in darkness, Brenda panics again- \nBRENDA No.. No... don't turn it off! \n", "test3_id": 1670}

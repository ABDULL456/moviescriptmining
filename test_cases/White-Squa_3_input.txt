FRANCIS I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip. 
SKIPPER I know. 
Francis looks the Skipper over, reading him, smiling. 
SKIPPER You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it. (to Philip) Hello, Philip. 
PHIL Sir. 
Skipper's directness bugs Francis. 
FRANCIS Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October. 
SKIPPER As you can see, there's a lot to do. 
FRANCIS Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind. 
SKIPPER This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed. 
Something in this exchange turns the tone of conversation. 
FRANCIS And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here. 
SKIPPER Happily, it all worked out... This time. (to Bill) Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk. 
Phil follows Bill down the companionway. 
FRANCIS I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me. 
SKIPPER It will be more than that, I can promise you. 
FRANCIS (cool) Take good care of my son. 
There is threat in his tone. 
SKIPPER We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye. 
FRANCIS He's a big boy. 
Francis leaves the boat.  Skipper and the crew watch as he climbs into his waiting embassy limousine and drives off. 
LAWFORD Well, that was neighborly. 
SKIPPER He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly. 
Lawford shakes his head.  Bill comes up through the companionway. 
SKIPPER Everyone aboard young Bill? 
BILL Yes, Sir. 
SKIPPER Good. (beat) Let's go sailing. 
EXT.  ALBATROSS - OPEN WATER - DAY 
The Albatross is under full power.  There is a sense of excitement and anticipation.  Charlie, Rick, Robin, and Lawford are on the halyard for the mainsail.  Skipper is at the helm with Alice and Bill nearby.  Skipper calls over to Chuck who stands alone at the rail. 
SKIPPER Come over here and take the wheel. 
Chuck's eyes light up as he walks over and takes the wheel. 
SKIPPER Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west. 
CHUCK Yes sir. 
SKIPPER (to all) Gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out.  I want to know that you've heard and understand. (quietly to Bill) Raise the mainsail. 
BILL (calling out) Raise the main! 
Lawford and his group bellow out. 
TOGETHER Raise the main!! 
Lawford coaches the boys, sending two scurrying on top the chart house to loosen the stops which hold the heavy furled canvas to the main boom.  He guides another to the midships pinrail where the main halyard, which raises the huge sail, is made fast to a belaying pin.  He loosens the halyard and hands it to Robin. 
SKIPPER Take a turn under the pin and lead it out to the others.  You guys in the rear take up the slack.  Heave together now... 
In a beautiful tenor voice, Bill begins to croon a sea chanty, an old whaling song with an Irish lilt. 
BILL (singing) "When the sun came up there was whisky in the cup..." 
The more experienced boys echo the line and pull to the beat. 
BOYS "When the sun came up there was whisky in the cup..." 
LAWFORD Come on the rest of you, sing!  Belt it out like men!! 
The newer guys like Chuck, John, Robin and Terry look at each other like this is the queerest thing they have ever heard of. 
BILL (singing) "Not one of us was a sober..." 
The boys return the verse half heartedly.  Lawford ties off his line and stares them down.  Skipper notices that the work has stopped. 
SKIPPER What's wrong Mr. Lawford. 
LAWFORD It seems we're short on singers. 
Skipper walks amid ship and addresses the crew. 
SKIPPER Everyone sings aboard a wind jammer gentlemen.  It lets everyone know you're in sync.  It shows unity, that all thoughts are one.  A crew that sings together stays together. Besides, I like it.  So, pipe up and be sailors.

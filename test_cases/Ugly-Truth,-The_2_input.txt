JONAH Ooh...is she hot? 
MIKE She would be if she were less irritating. 
JONAH So she likes to make fun of your clothes and stuff? 
MIKE No, actually I make fun of hers'. 
JONAH You told me not to do that.

MIKE That's right. And you should listen to me. 
JONAH If you know so much about chicks, why are you sitting here playing "Fight Night" with me when you could be out with the Jello girls? 
MIKE Because this is better. 
Elizabeth enters, wearing a pair of sweats and carrying her laptop. She hands Mike a digital camera. 
ELIZABETH Hurry, take a picture of me. I'm online with Fugly35 and he wants to know what i look like. 
MIKE You really want to go out with a guy named Fugly35? 
ELIZABETH He's being ironic. Look, he's hot. 
She holds up her laptop. Mike peers at it. 
MIKE Uh...look closer. That's Jim Morrison. Who I'm pretty sure isn't an accountant in Rio Rancho. 
ELIZABETH Shit. Are you serious? 
Jonah holds out his hand to his mom. 
JONAH You owe me a dollar. 
MIKE What are you wasting your time on the internet for anyway? 
ELIZABETH Says the man who hasn't had a decent relationship since 1999. 
MIKE At least I date.

A cage of randy Bonobos getting it on. Mike, in a gorilla suit, does a segment. Next to him is an anthropologist, DR. LESTER. 
DR. LESTER Of all primates, Bonobos are the closest relatives to human beings, both genetically and socially Â­- especially when it comes to sex. For the Bonobo, sex is a way to ease stress and diffuse tensions. 
MIKE So summing up Bonobo-land, the chicks look great, get freaky in bed and in turn, they get to sit on their asses and boss their men around all day. 
DR. LESTER That's one way of looking at it. 
MIKE If that's not an argument for evolution, I don't know what is. 
He winks at the camera as -- 
CAMERA GUY Cut!

Abby watches.       Mike walks over to join her. 
MIKE What did you think? 
ABBY It was good. 
MIKE Did you hear Corporate's taking me to Saffron tonight? What do you think --

ABBY (cutting him off) Colin called. He wants to get together again. 
MIKE Cool. 
He starts pulling off his gorilla suit as he heads for the van. Abby follows him. 
ABBY How long do you think I should wait to sleep with him? 
MIKE The more you make him beg for it, the more you've got him on the hook. Do everything but. Then show him beneath that control freak exterior, there's a sexual deviant waiting to be unleashed. 
ABBY I am not a sexual deviant. 
MIKE Good point. If memory serves us right, you've been out of practice for what? A year? 
ABBY (defensive) No...eleven months.

It's some kind of countdown clock. \nPETER Countdown to what? \nHARRY I don't know, but whatever it is, it's only six hours away. \nPETER The Planetary Conjunction? \nHARRY Could be... \nPETER Or Doc Ock's end of the world experiment... Or both! \nHARRY Wait a minute. You're not telling me you think the world is gonna end tonight...? \nPETER You want to wait around till midnight to find out? \nHARRY No, but... \nPETER Let's see what else we've got. \nAnother set of numbers roll up on the SCREEN. They are accompanied by ELECTRICAL SYMBOLS. \nHARRY What's that? \nPETER It might be a calculation of the amount of power he needs to create the hole between the force and the anti-force. \nHARRY That's a lot of energy. What could generate power like that? \nPETER The closest you could come is the New York City Subway System. \nAgain, the lights flicker and then dim and they return. \nHARRY/PETER (together) We gotta talk to Professor Rosomorf!! \nINT. BROADWAY EXPRESS - NIGHT \nROZ boards and takes a seat. There are the usual SUBWAY TYPES. A FAT WOMAN. A PIMPLY TEENAGER and his date, a TALL SKINNY GIRL in a PARTY DRESS. \nROZ, making notations in a PAD, takes no notice of them. He sits down, closes his PAD, and taps a PENCIL against his chin. \nROZ Plutonium... \nEXT. MAJOR INTERSECTION - NIGHT \nTAXIS go by. TWO LOVERS stroll. We hear a familiar WHINE. The \"WALK\" and \"DON'T WALK\" signs FLASH at the same time. \nBOY Make up your mind! \nThe signs EXPLODE! The COUPLE stops in their tracks. The BOY looks at the GIRL. \nGIRL What's going on? \nAn ARC of ELECTRICITY now shoots between the LIGHT PILLARS of the SUBWAY STATION on the corner. \nINT. BROADWAY LOCAL - NIGHT \nSPARKS fly by the window. ROZ, oblivious at first, is now stunned by the show. \nEXT. SUBWAY TRAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nThe ARCS of ELECTRICITY continue to rise. The STREET LIGHTS buckle and bend into weird shapes. \nWOMAN Oh my God! \nMAN Get back! Get back! \nEXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT \nTWO TAXIS roar through the intersection and COLLIDE. The ETHNIC DRIVERS leap out and begin arguing. \nINT. TRAIN - NIGHT \nPEOPLE SCREAM and fall back as the TRAIN seems to change angles. \nEXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nA building ROAR rises from the SUBWAY ENTRANCE. Then the sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE! The BOY looks down the STAIRS and has to leap out of the way as the BROADWAY EXPRESS comes highballing up the STEPS and blasts through the SUBWAY entrance. \nThe TRAIN sails through the air. \nEXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT \nThe TRAIN crashes into the building in a storm of cyclotron generated Dali physics. \nEXT. THE STREET - NIGHT \nThe THROB and PULSE recede.

The WALL through which the train has come sags and ripples like it has melted and partially resolidified. \nWOMAN Henry!!! \nSeveral PASSENGERS climb out of the WINDOWS of the TRAIN or pry open the DOORS. \nWOMAN What are you doing here? Get out of here! Get out of here! \nEXT. THE STREET - NIGHT \nA CROWD has gathered to gawk and point. They look up and we see their POV. \nThe MIDDLE CAR of the TRAIN is simply \"embedded\" in the HIGH-RISE, its rear sticking out of the building fifteen stories up. From its COUPLING dangles the LAST CAR. \nINT. MIDDLE CAR - NIGHT \nThe car is bisected in the middle by the fused brick and glass of the WALL of the building. PASSENGERS on the outside of the WALL press their faces to the GLASS and pound for help. \nROZ comes to the aid of a MOTHER with TWO CHILDREN. \nEXT. THE STREET - NIGHT \nThe CROWD sees something else. Swinging high in the sky is your friendly neighborhood SPIDER-MAN. The COUPLE and TWO DRIVERS argue about what this means. \nWOMAN It's Spider-Man! \nTRUCK DRIVER #1 Get outa here, you bum! \nWOMAN Hey, what are you talking about?! \nTRUCK DRIVER #2 (back at woman) What's the matter, lady don't you read the papers? \nThis is the DRIVER of a DAILY BUGLE truck carrying the historically famous Bugle headline, \"Spider-Man - Threat or Menace?\" \nMAN Go Spidey! Go! \nINT. LAST CAR - NIGHT \nIt's nearly vertical! People are tumbled over each other. The scared TEENAGER is tearing at the door. The SKINNY GIRL screams in a mechanical way. The DOOR opens. He nearly falls! \nThe SKINNY GIRL screams again. He manages to get back inside. She looks at him, safe now. But she screams again anyway. \nROZ struggles to right himself against a pole. A BAG OF GROCERIES goes sliding past him. It continues downward and out the OPEN DOOR. \nINSERT: The BAG tumbles down through the air. Down, down, and down... \nINT. MIDDLE CAR - NIGHT \nSPIDEY'S face appears in the WINDOW upside down. \nSPIDER-MAN Hello, everybody... \nHe slides the WINDOW down and flips inside. He walks through the parting PASSENGERS to the BUILDING WALL. He feels it. \nSPIDER-MAN Okay, everyone, stand back and stay cool. \nHe hurls himself at the fused GLASS portion and bounces back onto the floor. He rolls over, flexing his shoulder. \nWOMAN (whining) Is that the real Spider-Man? \nSPIDEY does a TRIPLE FLIP to his feet. He reaches up for the overhead RAILING and pulls it down easily. Oohs and aahs. SPIDER-MAN points it at the GLASS and hefts it. \nSPIDER-MAN Somebody wanna give me a hand with this? \nFirst the WOMAN, and then all of them, take up positions on the BATTERING RAM. \nSPIDER-MAN On three. One... Two... Three! \nThey ram the GLASS and it shatters. \nINT. THE LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT \nHENRY stands at the open DOOR of the TRAIN in his bedroom as they all come rushing through into the room. \nHENRY Come on. Come on. That's it. Step lively now. \nWIFE Henry, the rugs! \nHENRY Oh, shut up! \nSPIDER-MAN Have a nice evening, Ma'am... and you too, Henry. \nEXT.

The \"BULLET\" begins to PULSE and THROB! The DIALS spin! The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, \"00:05:58\". \nEXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT \nThe FULL MOON hangs over the building. FLASH and HARRY and KIM stand at the entrance to the CENTER. FLASH starts to run to the building. \nFLASH (screaming) Liz! Liz come on out! \nThey run forward but as they reach the FRONT STEPS the building lurches upward. The bottom step becomes a wall of STONE and DIRT, six feet high. \nHARRY Get back! Flash... get back! \nFLASH Wow...! \nThen the building lurches upward again! This time it pulls FREE from the ground. The KIDS take cover as WATER LINES BURST and ELECTRICAL WIRES SPARK. \nINT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - NIGHT \nLIZ opens a door. \nLIZ Peter! \nThe building lurches throwing her back across the HALL where she crashes through another door. \nINT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT \nAll manner of stuff is flying around. LIZ comes sliding across the floor. She crashes into a CABINET. GLASSWARE starts to fall on her, but crashes into the CEILING instead. She is dragged up the WALL. She kicks and screams against the Anti-Force. \nEXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT \nFLASH, KIM and HARRY look on as heavy ELECTRICAL CABLES stretch upward to the rising CENTER and then snap in showers of sparks. As they fall away the CENTER becomes airborne. The CABLES wave up at it, shooting arcs of ELECTRICITY directly at the building. \nINT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT \nLIZ slides down the WALL. She grabs at the WINDOW and looks out. The rest of the university recedes beneath her, now a hundred feet below. And they're still rising! FLASH and HARRY look up. \nFLASH Oh my God... Liz is inside there! \nHARRY And Professor Rosomorf and crazy Ock. \nFLASH What about Peter? Is he there with them? \nHARRY No, but I bet Spider-Man is. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF UNIVERSITY - NIGHT \nPeople look up at the SCIENCE CENTER. A CYCLIST, riding and looking, crashes into a TAXI. MAX REISS leaps out with the BEAUTIFUL STARLET from the TAXI. \nMAX That's some show... if ever I saw one. \nINT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nHe's looking out his window seeing the University's Lab Building flying by. Up and up toward the sky. \nJAMESON (shouting) Tear out the front page! Change the headline... The biggest news is happening right now... we need photos... a camera... get me a camera...! \nEXT. SKY - NIGHT \nA very long shot of the SCIENCE CENTER rising into the CLOUDS. \nINT. AUNT MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nShe pulls aside a CURTAIN and watches the SCIENCE CENTER rise. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nOCK works the COMPUTER as the CONSOLE sends up SHOWERS of SPARKS. He glances at the \"BULLET\" which now PULSES. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK at \"00:04:18\". \nROZ Where is it going Otto? \nOCK Other worlds, Roz, other times, other dimensions, who knows? Who cares? \nROZ Then... why? \nOCK Truth, Rosomorf. Look at it! The new truth! The new way! \nSPIDER-MAN Don't listen to him Professor Roz. \nOCK No, you don't listen to that clown, he can't save you, or the world for that matter. \nA WALDO reaches in and rips ROZ off SPIDEY, flinging him back against a WALL. ROZ lands in a heap beneath a FIRE STATION (HOSE, EXTINGUISHER, AXE). \nWe see the WALDO reach out for SPIDER-MAN. It wraps around his FOOT and begins to tug, slowly... \nOCK Once and for all, Spider-Man... once and for all we'll end the legend of your powers. \nOCK knocks SPIDER-MAN with a real BIG BLOW with his WALDO. OCK is slowly dragging SPIDER-MAN to a HUGE HOLE that's been ripped in the floor by the BEAMS of ELECTRICITY. We see New York a half a mile down through the hole. We see SPIDEY being drawn across the HOLE. Then ROZ comes flying in with the FIRE AXE. \nROZ hacks away at the WALDO and chops it off! The stump withdraws. OCK examines it in pain and fury! \n", "test2_true": "ROZ doesn't even look back. He and SPIDEY are at the edge of the HOLE and he's shaking SPIDEY furiously. OCK sends out his other WALDO and begins banging it on the floor in a frenzy on either side of ROZ and SPIDEY. Like a child denied, he smashes his steel fists against the floor again and again. \nOCK You were my teacher! And you want to destroy my experiment. You are a scientist for heaven sake... don't you want to know what's up there? \nROZ Yes, but not on account of our world. We have only one world... only one life. The floor begins to craze and then crack like ice around a hole on a pond. BANG! BANG! SPIDEY comes to just as the section of floor beneath himself and ROZ gives way and falls through. \nSPIDEY grabs hold of the edge and dangles. He looks down and sees ROZ falling away beneath him, disappearing into the dark. \nROZ (calling back from the dark skies) Spider-Man! Only you can save us now... \nSPIDER-MAN Roz!!! (turns to Ock) Murderer!!! \nOCK Forget that old fool, insect. My Spider-Man... Come join me on my fantastic voyage to the 7th heaven. \nEXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK \nThe PLANETS are virtually in line! \nINT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - NIGHT \nLIZ comes running through it. A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY shoots from the right to the left in front of her. She slams on the brakes and runs the other way. \nLIZ Peter! Peter! \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nThe COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at, \"00:02:59\". OCK throws the POWER THROTTLE to 98% POWER. He laughs and a WEB splats against his GLASSES. SPIDEY scrambles to his feet. OCK, still trying to get the WEB GOO off his GLASSES, is slammed into the CONSOLE by SPIDER-MAN. SPARKS fly and WALDOS flail blindly, smashing things. OCK tears off his GLASSES and squints through the FIRE and SMOKE and GLARE. SPIDER-MAN THWIPS the ceiling and swings into a drop kick! OCK recovers. He grabs SPIDEY and slam dunks him through the hole in the floor. \nEXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE BUILDING - NIGHT \nSPIDER-MAN falls through the air. He shoots up a WEB and THWIPS, it sticks to the ROCKY bottom of the FOUNDATION. OCK appears in the HOLE. He sees SPIDEY'S dilemma, hanging on a thread of WEB. A half-broken WALDO snakes down and CLIPS the WEB. \nBut the WEB sticks to the WALDO! OCK shakes it, but he can't get loose. SPIDER-MAN shoots out another WEB at the ROCK BOTTOM and, with the leverage, he pulls OCK out. OCK swings down in a wide arc and his WALDOS catch on the ROCK upside down. He holds on fiercely. \nOCK scrambles out to the side of the CENTER and begins looking for an entry. SPIDER-MAN is right on his tail. The building pitches sideways! OCK turns to face SPIDER- MAN, his broken WALDOS out for BATTLE. \nSPIDEY grabs an EXPOSED PIPE and breaks it off, brandishing it like a broad sword. \nSPIDER-MAN Let's have it, old boy! A bizarre DUEL takes place. The CENTER pitches this way and that. SPIDEY and OCK move from foothold to foothold, from WINDOW to LEDGE to PARAPET. \nNow the CENTER pitches to a 45 degree angle. They DUEL upside down! A WINDOW GRATE crashes open and LIZ comes flying out, holding onto the GRATE for dear life! \nSPIDER-MAN Liz!! OCK seizes the opportunity to whack SPIDEY across the head. SPIDEY loses his footing but the building now lurches back and LIZ goes flying back inside. SPIDEY ducks inside too and pulls the GRATE. \nSPIDER-MAN uses his great strength to move a HUGE PIECE of SCIENTIFIC MACHINERY in front of the GRATE. \nSPIDER-MAN Come on. \nLIZ Where's Peter? He must be here somewhere. \nSPIDER-MAN (pulling her ahead) He's around, don't worry... we'll find him. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nThe COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at, \"00:01:00\" as SPIDEY comes flying in with LIZ in tow. \nLIZ This building is flying. I'm in a goddamn flying building... \nSPIDER-MAN I think we have to pull some of these cables. Try those over there. I'll work on these. We gotta slow this thing down somehow. We got helicopters coming. \nLIZ looks at some WIRING, apprehensive about even touching it. \nSPIDER-MAN Pull! \nShe yanks out a CABLE. The building pitches. But when SPIDEY pulls one out, it rights itself. \nEXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT \nThe BIG BEAMS start cutting out one by one. The CENTER begins to PITCH and YAW. The CHOPPERS are getting closer. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nThe COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, \"00:00:15\" as SPIDEY and LIZ continue to pull WIRES and CABLES. TWO WALDOS erupt through the floor and grab SPIDEY. They pull SPIDEY to the floor. Entangled in these molybdimum pythons, SPIDEY struggles valiantly. LIZ leaps to his aid. \nLIZ Oh my God... \nA third WALDO, a broken one, snakes up from the HOLE and begins feeling blindly around on the CONSOLE for the POWER THROTTLE. \nSPIDER-MAN The power! \nLIZ sees the damaged WALDOS heading for the RED THROTTLE. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at \"00:00:10\". LIZ leaps and tries to wrestle it away. It whips in her arms and she holds on tight. It bangs her against the wall and then the CONSOLE. She holds on. \"00:00:03\". The WALDO crashes LIZ against the wall which erupts in SPARKS. She lets go of it. It heads for the POWER THROTTLE! \"00:00:01!\" SPIDER-MAN can't break the grip of the WALDOS, but he can pull with super-human strength. He yanks OCK up through the STONE floor. OCK hits the ceiling of the CONTROL ROOM. ONE WALDO grabs on. The other one throws the RED POWER THROTTLE! \nOCK Spider-Man. You're end is coming. Life in its present form is ending... new dimensions, new horizons... \nThe UNIVERSAL BULLET begins to GLOW. The GLOW sharpens to a POINT of LIGHT. SPIDER-MAN holds on tight against a rushing ENERGY FLOW that's pulling everything in the room towards the POINT of LIGHT. \nLIZ (bracing against the storm) What is happening? \n", "test2_id": 700, "test3_input": "SPIDER-MAN (similarly braced) I don't know!!! \nLIZ starts to slip away into the flow. She struggles against it. \nLIZ I can't... hold on! \nSPIDEY THWIPS her and she grabs onto the WEB. \nSPIDER-MAN Hold tight, Liz, hold tight! \nOCK drops calmly, beatifically, to the floor of the room. He moves slowly, under his own power, into the LIGHT. \nOCK (spaced out) You cut my power... there's too little power... It's so tiny... so tiny... there's only space... for me. But I've done it, Spider-Man. I have broken through... I've broken through! \nLIZ Don't do it, Dr. Octavius! \nOCK Okey... dokey... Now that's what I call an experiment!!! \nAs he nears the LIGHT he actually becomes a part of it. He radiates LIGHT. He shimmers and shines. He fills the room with BLINDING LIGHT. \nSPIDEY and LIZ shield their eyes, and as the light diminishes, the storm subsides. They're safe. Except for the fact that they're in a floating building, 10,000 feet above the city! \nEXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT \nAgainst the backdrop of the MOON, a SQUADRON of HELICOPTERS approaches the CENTER. From their POV, a HUGE CRACK opens across the face of the building. The CENTER begins to drop in PULSING SURGES. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nSPIDER-MAN is at the CONSOLE pulling and putting back WIRES. LIZ, fascinated, looks in at the WINDOW where OCK disappeared. \nSPIDER-MAN I can't control her. She's dropping too fast! Alright... let's go! \nLIZ But what about Peter? We've got to find Peter! \nSPIDER-MAN Peter will be okay, I promise you... Let's go before it's too late. (he grabs her) \nLIZ Go where? \nEXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT \nIt rotates and drops. The HELICOPTERS come in like the cavalry. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nTrying to leave it, LIZ and SPIDEY are confronted with a nightmare. The room is tilted at a 45% angle. PIPES are bursting. SPIDEY helps LIZ through the obstacles. Debris rains down. They come face to face with a diagonal maze of PIPES. \nSPIDER-MAN Maybe there's another way... \nA HUGE CRACK opens above them. \nLIZ It's breaking apart! \nSPIDER-MAN Alright, keep moving, a step at a time! \nThey scale the maze, but as they emerge on the other side, half the floor falls away! Central Park awaits, 8,000 feet below. \nLIZ We have to go back. \nSPIDER-MAN We can't go back. \nHe looks across at the door. It is midway up a diagonal wall. He shoots a WEB up at the ceiling between themselves and the door. Then he extends a hand to LIZ. \nLIZ Forget it... \nSPIDER-MAN Okay, have it your way. \nHe swings across and lands on the LEDGE of the DOOR. Then he swings the WEB back to her like a trapeze. LIZ catches the WEB and looks across at SPIDER-MAN, furious. \nLIZ (shouting across) What am I supposed to do with this! \nSPIDER-MAN (shouting back) Go ahead. It's easier than it looks! We've got to try the fire escape. \nLIZ swings across like TARZAN and SPIDEY gathers her in on the LEDGE. She does a comic \"phew\" and the LEDGE buckles beneath them but holds. SPIDER-MAN tries to open the door, but it's stuck. \nLIZ The door is stuck. \nSPIDER-MAN bends his back to the task. It take all his strength, but with a comic AAAAARGGHH! He bends the DOOR open. \nEXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT \nThey burst out onto the ROCK FOUNDATION of the building. New York is rushing up to meet them. The WIND created by their fall buffets them. The HELICOPTERS arrive, and the falling building plunges right past them. The HELICOPTERS look across at each other, helpless. \nEXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT \nIt drops like a stone. \nEXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT \nSPIDEY and LIZ are falling away from the DOOR, sliding along the ROCK. LIZ is stopped by a RETAINING WALL. SPIDEY keeps sliding. He THWIPS the wall and then disappears over the edge. LIZ screams! \n", "test3_true": "A long, long beat. \nPETER (V.O.) Liz, Up here! \nLIZ looks up and sees PETER hanging out the WINDOW two stories above her. He throws out a ROPE LADDER. LIZ grabs it. She begins to climb. \nINT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT \nPETER pulls LIZ through the WINDOW. There is no time for an embrace. \nPETER Come on. I've found a way down. \nLIZ (at long last, love) I knew you were going to say that. \nThey run out of the ROOM. We PAN down and see, crumpled beneath the WINDOW, the SPIDER-MAN suit. \nINT. LARGE PHYSICS LAB - NIGHT \nThis is the LAB we saw in the opening sequence. PETER has turned on the lights. He's got a handful of ROPE. \nLIZ Where's the way out? \nPETER Right there! \nWe are looking at the HUGE AMERICAN FLAG. \nPETER Come on, help me with this. \nEXT. THE FOUNDATION - NIGHT \nLIZ is already down the ROPE LADDER and is holding it for PETER. He comes down with a HUGE bundle of RED, WHITE & BLUE. \nPETER Okay, stand still. \nHe ties some ROPE around her waist. \nLIZ Is this going to work? \nPETER How do I know? \nLIZ I just adore confidence in a man. \nPETER Come on... \nThey move to the edge of the ROCK and look down. CENTRAL PARK is still a couple thousand feet down. \nLIZ What is it you say when you jump? \nPETER Your prayers. \nThey SCREAM as the building lurches again, knocking them to the ground. They start to slide across the ROCK. They reach out for each other but their hands don't quite reach. \nSlowly, they inch back together, but the FOUNDATION cracks between them. \nEXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT \nIt spins and falls beneath us. Down, down it goes. And then it crashes into the GREAT LAWN. A huge cloud of debris shoots upward. \nEXT. THE SKY - NIGHT \nThere is a beautiful FULL MOON. PETER and LIZ float down into the frame lit by its wonderful light. \nThe AMERICAN FLAG which has turned into a huge parachute. They hold each other tight. They can hear SIRENS below. They begin to laugh with relief. Then they stop. The wind billows LIZ'S skirt and plays with PETER'S hair, and snaps in the AMERICAN FLAG. \nLIZ We have a lot to thank your friend Spider-Man for. \nPETER Somehow, I don't think we've seen the last of him. \nLIZ Peter...! Finders, keepers... \nPETER What...? What is it? Why do you look like that? \nLIZ I think I'm in love. \nPETER (even his eyes blush) You are... \nLIZ With your friend... \nPETER Spider-Man? You're in love with Spider-Man? \nLIZ I am... you think we'll see him again? \nPETER We might... you never know. He kisses her. \nLIZ Oh.

{"train": "Spider-Man Script \nS P I D E R - M A N \nWritten by Barry Cohen and Ted Newson and James Cameron \n2nd Revision by Joseph Goldmari and James Cameron and John Brancato Third Revision by James Cameron based on screenplays by Ted Newsom & John Brancato, Barney Cohen and Joseph Goldman \nSECOND REV. \nFADE IN: INT. PROFESSOR OCK\"S PRIVATE PHYSICS LABORATORY, THE CYCLOTRON ROOM (CREDIT SEQUENCE) - DAY \nA mighty WARNING KLAXON assaults our ears. A FLASHING RED WARNING LIGHT stabs our eyes. \nSeveral DIALS go into the RED. A hand pushes aside a YELLOW THERMOS and pushes forward a RED POWER THROTTLE. We hear the WHINING UP of a cyclotron. A DIGITAL DIAL climbs to \"5% POWER.\" A SPIDER crawls across a DIAL. \nBegin OPENING CREDITS. \nTHE CYCLOTRON ROOM is in an old basement full of peeling paint and plumbing wrapped with TAPE. Leaks are here and there. COBWEBS are all around. \nDOCTOR OTTO OCTAVIUS (OCK) is a strong but strange featured man in his mid-fifties. \nHis assistant, WEINER, hovers nearby looking on. He's open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. WEINER is a local, small-time hood hired by OCK to circumvent the school administration and to \"procure\" whatever OCK needs for his experiments. He shades his eyes against a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM that erupts from the WINDOW. THE ROOM IS DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL ROOM AND THE EXPERIMENT CHAMBERS. \nWEINER Whoa, whoa, whoa... what's that? \nWith a WHOOSH, the WINDOW EXPLODES, showering the TWO with shards of GLASS, and throwing them to the floor. \nOCK (rising) We begin again... let's kick in that new transducer. See if we can double the power output. \nWEINER (rising more slowly) Whoa, Doc... wait a minute... \nBut OCK is already at the THROTTLE. The cyclotron whirls up. The lights go on. Louder, brighter than before. OCK looks through the broken WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER. The POWER DIAL inches upward, \"eight, nine...\" the BLUE-WHITE LIGHT is blinding now. The WHINE pitch is shattering. \nEND OPENING CREDITS. \nOCK Okey... dokey! \nThe POWER DIAL hits ten. \nEXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY \nAs STUDENTS go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills out of the SCIENCE CENTER onto the grounds of Empire State University. \nWe see PETER PARKER, a pleasant faced senior who's among the top in his class. Sincere and serious, he has yet to develop a way with women. \nLIZ (falling in step) Hiya Peter... \nLIZ ALLEN is also a senior. She's beautiful and intelligent. \nPETER (ardent but uncomfortable) Hiya Liz... how're you doing...? \nLIZ (teasing softly) How'm I doing what? \nHARRY Peter! Peter! Wait up! \nHARRY is the school nerd. A quirky kid who, like PETER, can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty ones like Liz. \nHARRY (to Liz) Would you, uh... excuse us for a minute? \nDespite PETER'S protesting body language, HARRY pulls him away like a conspirator. \nPETER What is it? what... \nHARRY Did the Astro-Physics Journal really accept your paper? \nPETER (laughs, embarrassed) Yeah... well... all I got's the data but they've agreed to publish it when it's finished. You know... it's my calculation on the Planetary Conjunction. \nHARRY And its influence on the anti-force. Isn't it? \nPETER Yes. Look, Harry, I am busy with... (indicates Liz standing there) \nHARRY Yeah, you and the rest of the class. Every one is busy with Liz. \nLIZ (growing impatient) Peter? \nA HAND reaches in and smacks her bottom. \nFLASH Hiya, cupcakes... \nLIZ (elbowing him affectionately) Flash...! \nThey kiss and walk away. \nHARRY (sneering) And Flash is the busiest of them all... \nPETER (disappointed) Come on, Harry... we'll be late for Octavius. \nHARRY makes a gesture dismissing OCK as crazy. \nLIZ Ahh, it is something. \nPETER No... look. \nThe equipment on her TABLE is starting to vibrate. They look at it, curiously. We hear the cyclotron's WHINE begin to build... \nINT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - DAY \nEverything is shaking like in an earthquake... Roz and Thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with anger and surprise. The WHINE is deafening! The light is blinding! WEINER has his eyes closed and his hands over his ears. \nOCK I am going for 20 percent power! \nTHORKEL NO!! Don't do that... \nROZ Ock! Its dangerous... \nTHORKEL Ock I warn you... \nWEINER crosses himself. The CONSOLE erupts in sparks. \nINT. ELECTRICAL CONDUIT MONTAGE - DAY \nWe follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along the WIRES and CABLES inside the WALLS and FLOORS. It is making its way up to the LAB! \nINT. LAB - DAY \nAll the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating equipment. \nThe CHARGE crackles up a WIRE and erupts at LIZ'S TABLE. A BREAKER explodes in flames. There is an outburst of AD LIBS: \"Fire!\" \"Everybody out!\" \nTHORKEL (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing LIZ trapped behind the fire which is growing from second to second. \nTHORKEL Keep calm, everybody keep calm. Use the front door. Everybody out the front. \nPETER Liz! Come on...! \nLIZ I can't. Help me! \nPETER I'm coming! \nHe wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the FLAMES. His sleeve is on fire. He pats it out. \nLIZ Peter! \nFlash appears and tries to help but Thorkel stops him. \nTHORKEL Get back, you idiots. You can't go in there! \nLIZ smashes at the WINDOW, but this is an inner city school and the WINDOWS are covered by STEEL GATES. Liz wraps her fingers in the GATE. \nLIZ (out at the street) Help! Help me! \nOutside the WINDOW the air is clear and people come and go. Some are stopping to look up at the girl on the second floor who screams (but they can't hear, of course) down at them as the FLAMES close in behind her. \nPETER comes flying in with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He fumbles with it. FLASH pushes Thorkel, grabs the extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain. LIZ turns to face the FLAMES. Suddenly there is an eruption of CO2 CLOUDS and the roar of a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. \nThe FLAMES are beaten down enough for her to leap out. FLASH is there, holding the EXTINGUISHER. People CHEER. \nPETER Thanks for your help Flash. \nFLASH No problem wimp. \nPETER Our hero has a real way with words. \nLIZ Oh, why don't you grow up. \nPETER is stung, insulted, turns away. ROSOMORF peeps in, worried -- faces Thorkel. \nTHORKEL This man will bring a disaster upon this university. \nOCK comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has happened. \nOCK The universe is made up of forces... and counter-forces. Science is the study of the forces! \nFLASH hands the EXTINGUISHER to PETER. LIZ embraces FLASH, throwing a glimpse at PETER who tried so bravely. He looks away and turns the last of the EXTINGUISHER on the last of the FIRE. \nOCK (continues without a hitch) But I... Professor Otto Octavius... have devoted my life to the study of the counter-forces! Good job, Peter. \nPETER (taking place at lab table) Thanks, Professor. \nTHORKEL has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the front of the huge LAB. He simply cannot believe OCK'S behavior. \nTHORKEL I don't believe it, I simply don't... \nOCK Can we carry on Mr. Thorkel. \nTHORKEL I don't believe... oh, all right carry on Professor. \nOCK Well! This week my dear students I have made a stunning breakthrough... \nShe grabs her coat, crosses back to Peter and tugs on his shoulder. \nPETER It's Friday night... \nMAY Yes. Do you have a date? \nPETER No. \nMAY Then come on. \nINT. LARGE COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT \nIt is dark and empty except for COMPUTERS. Sitting at it, lit by the GLOW of its screen, is SOLOMON ROSOMORF (ROZ). As he works, a DOOR opens behind him. Someone walks quietly through the LAB. ROSOMORF keeps working. The intruder approaches... \nTHORKEL (at his ear) Professor Rosomorf, what happened here? \nROZ Someone tried to rob me of some paper... I suspect they were looking for that one. \nTHORKEL What is it? \nROZ (unruffled) Award winning stuff. (turning slightly) Peter Parker's data on the Planetary Conjunction. Damn lucky I hid it in my computer under another title. \nTHORKEL My God, what's going on in our school? First Professor Octavius almost blows up the Physics lab... Now this. You report it in triplicate, of course. \nROZ Thorkel, be careful when you talk to Octavius. Remember... the man is a very fragile genius. One day he'll bring us all the Noble Prize. \nTHORKEL Rosomorf, the man is a very dangerous crackpot! \nOff screen the voice of the CYCLOTRON WHINE begins to build. \nROZ That's him again. He's working day and night. \nTHORKEL I tell you the man is very dangerous. (the whine grows louder) Come on Rosomorf, let's stop him before this building will explode. \nINT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT \nOCK and WEINER are at work as before. OCK takes no notice of the TWO MEN who come in, nor the WORKER who comes in behind them and sets to work attaching a BIG LOCK to the door. \nTHORKEL Shut it down, Octavius. \nOCK ignores him. WEINER touches OCK'S shoulder. OCK ignores him too. \nTHORKEL You've blown half the circuits in the Science Center. \nOCK Call an electrician. \nTHORKEL I have called the locksmith. \nOCK What... what is he doing. \nHe points toward the worker who's working on the lock on the main door. \nTHORKEL We have to shut your lab down and take a look at the lines. \nROZ Please, Otto, we must lock it up. \nOCK (to Thorkel) You're denying me access to my cyclotron?! \nTHORKEL You bet. \nOCK glares back and forth between the TWO MEN, the WORKER, and WEINER. Then he pulls BACK the RED POWER THROTTLE. \nThe WHINE descends. \nThe WALDOS pull back and dangle from their panel. The WHINE dies. \nOCK (contemplating) Okey, dokey... just give me till tomorrow. I want to clean up my papers. Tomorrow... Ha... Tomorrow you can have this room... \nROZ Oh... well Thorkel... few more hours won't make a difference. \nTHORKEL I hope. \nHe signals to the worker to stop. \nINT. APARTMENT OF AUNT MAY AND UNCLE BEN - NIGHT \nThe N.Y. Mets are playing baseball on T.V. PETER watches with his UNCLE BEN, a paunchy 65 years old in POLYESTER SLACKS and a COMFY OLD SWEATER. A N.Y. METS CAP is perched on BEN'S head. A BEER CAN is in his hand. A cluttered but familiar living room sprawls comfortably around them. \nBEN Another brewski? \nPETER No, I'm fine, Uncle Ben. \nBEN (at T.V.) Yah! Way to do it. Alright! (to Peter) You don't follow the Mets like you used to, do you, Pete? \nPETER No, not so much anymore. \nBEN Funny. When your Mom and Dad, uh, passed away... I had this idea... I wanted you to be the best baseball player that ever was. Geez, what ever happened to that? \nPETER Little league. \nPETER Sorry... I'd better go now. \nOCK (really angry now) You'll be sorry, Parker. \nPETER leaves. \nAnother URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the monitor SCREEN. On it, flashing RED, is the word, \"OVERLOAD!\" OCK pushes the RED POWER THROTTLE forward! The WHINE increases to a PULSE and THROB. \nINT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT \nIncredibly lit, the SPIDER is dropping on it's shimmering WEB-STRAND down toward the 5KG WEIGHT which now GLOWS in time with the THROB and PULSE. \nINT. THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nThe MONITOR is flashing \"MAXIMUM OVERLOAD - SHUT DOWN!\" OCK continues with the experiment. And then he sees the SPIDER! \nOCK You! Get out of there, you creeping... \nHe tries to shove the SPIDER with his hand. \nINT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT \nThrough the BLUE-WHITE we can barely make out OCK on the other side if the shattered WINDOW. He sends TWO WALDOS after the SPIDER. The SPIDER evades him and jumps onto the PROFESSOR's back. It then climbs onto the PROFESSOR's neck and bites him. \nOCK (anguish) Noooooooooooo! \nThe gravity DIAL goes to .000001, then pops back up as OCK'S tiny world goes berserk. DIALS spin, crack, explode or droop liquidly. WIRES dance on the CONSOLE which erupts like the 4th of JULY. \nOCK begins to float. His shirt begins to tear away. A DIAL floats by with its pulled WIRES undulating like a Medusa. WALDOS smash through the walls and flail like snakes. OCK'S YELLOW THERMOS distorts and EXPLODES! OCK, his hair wild, face locked in a multi-G grimace, is pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with SPARKS. \nOCK (ecstasy above the din) It's an energy storm! Okey! Dokey! \nWe see clearly the SPIDER still stuck to his neck. The big beast buffets and shakes. Tubes, junctions, valves and whatnot fall off, crashing to the floor where they twitch and writhe with a life of their own. \nThen, an enormous EXPLOSION rips a large hole in the CYCLOTRON's side, sending debris and a HUNDRED MICRO- STREAMS of ELECTRONIC PARTICLES lancing in our direction. \nINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT \nUltimate weirdness! The PULSING BLUE-WHITE LIGHT penetrates first the DOOR of the CYCLOTRON ROOM and then the very walls! LOCKERS bang, LAMPS POP, the ceiling sags in a SURREAL, RUBBERY way. \nThe WALLS sag too! The CYCLOTRON SIGN pivots and embeds itself in a WALL. A LADDER sinks in the WALL. The BLUE- WHITE LIGHT dances wildly about in PULSES. Then, suddenly, it stops... DEAD SILENCE. WEINER comes running in holding a double decker sandwich and a large bottle of Pepsi. Weiner enters OCK'S lab, singing, not at first noticing what's going on. Suddenly he stops dead. \nINT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT \nA scene out of DALI's surrealistic canvas. There are things inside of other things. DIALS look like DALI watches. This place has been rippled to the max! OCK lays face up, unconscious on the floor, a WALDO across his chest. The SPIDER is weaving its web. CAMERA slowly DOWN to see OCK. PIPES and WIRES are stuck to his body. The WALDO seems to be wrapping him. He wakes up to see those MECHANICAL ARMS buried in his body. They weave around him as if they are looking for prey. He tries to tear them out, but they seem to be a part of his body, like his other limbs. He screams. Suddenly Weiner sees OCK. \nWEINER Professor... what happened to you? What did you do... \nSuddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he flies back and out through the door to the corridor. \nINT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT \nWEINER Oh my God... what happened here... \nHe hears the police sirens approaching, he runs away. \nWEINER I better get out of here. \nEXT. THE EMPIRE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT \nThe long SCREAM segues to a POLICE SIREN. A COP CAR pulls to a halt in front of the COLLEGE. Many NYPD CARS are already there, along with a NUCLEAR REGULATORY VAN, some AMBULANCES, a VAN from the ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY and TWO TV VANS. ROZ runs across the lawn. \nPOLICE STRUGGLE to hold back the crowd of press, students and general gawkers. \nJ. JAMESON pushes to the front of the mob in time to see TWO COPS hustle a BUGLE PHOTOGRAPHER back into it. The MAN shakes his head. JAMESON throws down his CIGAR, stomps it, and pulls out a fresh one. THORKEL arrives to address the CROWD. \nTHORKEL (through bull horn) There is no danger. Please go back to your dorms. I repeat, there is no danger. \nJAMESON (approaches him) Spill it out, Professor! The public wants to know! \nThe CROWD closes on THORKEL. \nTHORKEL Who are you? \nJAMESON Jameson, Daily Bugle, Chief Editor, now what really happened here? \nTHORKEL There will be a press announcement in the morning Mr. Jameson... now if you'll excuse me. \nThis elicits a flood of AD LIBS: \"I heard a terrible explosion?\" \"Nuclear accidents?\" \"Meltdown?\" \"Genetic engineering?\" \"Are you guys making mutants in there?\" \nTHORKEL I have nothing to say... there will be an announcement. Now, please go home... everybody... we must clear the grounds... \nIn the back of the crowd are PETER, HARRY, LIZ, FLASH and KIM. \nFLASH You think they'll cancel classes? \nHARRY They must... the whole building must be contaminated with some kind of poisonous gas. \nPETER How about nuclear contaminations? \nAs PETER looks out at the STRETCHER, the SPIDER drops on his neck. He reacts by swatting it away. Bad move. The GLOWING SPIDER now squats malevolently on the back of PETER's hand. He stares at it transfixed. It bites. \nPETER Ow!!! \nPETER throws the SPIDER to the ripply tile floor where it scuttles unsteadily out the door. \nSweat starts to bead on PETER'S face. He shakes his head to clear it. His vision becomes uncertain. He lurches against a WEIRD SINK. \nPETER'S POV is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not just moving in and out anamorphically. It's all of that! \nGUARD (V.O.) (heavily distorted) Hey! What are you doing here, kid? \nPETER turns to see a UNIFORMED GUARD distorted by his crazy vision. \nPETER I feel a little funny... \nGUARD (heavily distorted) Yeah? Well, I ain't laughing. Get out... Just get out of here... \nEXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT \nIt bangs open. The GUARD throws PETER out and then throws his BACK PACK at him. \nGUARD (still distorted) You get yourself over to the Police lines. \nPETER (ultra wooz) Right. Police lines. \nEXT. UNIVERSITY - NIGHT \nPETER melds into the crowd. As in a dream, JAMESON appears at his side. \nJAMESON (distorted) Okay, scoop, whaddaya got? \nPETER I... got pictures of the Professor... in there... it's so strange in there... so bizarre... \nJAMESON (winks) Good job, kid. Bizarre is what we need. Pick this up in the morning. (holding up his camera) There'll be two crisp twenties tucked inside. \nHe hurries off. PETER peers after him and all of a sudden his vision corrects to a perfect focus. The sweat is gone. He's okay. He makes his way through the crowd to the street. \nWe TRACK with PETER as the madding throng recedes behind him. He turns a corner. He hears a SIREN. \nAn AMBULANCE screeches around the corner. It nearly hits PETER who leaps to avoid it. \nEXT. BRICK BUILDING - NIGHT \nPETER'S cheek is pressed against the brick. He opens his eyes and sees that he's hanging onto the side of the building like a spider. And he's three stories up! He looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him! And the Ambulance which he jumped over is driving away. He tries a downward step, but a BRICK dislodges and crashes to the sidewalk. He takes an upward step. And then another. \nTentatively at first, and then with growing confidence, he \"crawls\" to the roof of the building. At the top he gropes for a RAILING and slips. He dangles eight stories above the street. Then, with a grunt, he vaults to the roof one-handed. \nEXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT \nPETER is flat on his back, staring at the stars. He sits up and looks wonderingly at his hands. \nOn the back of his right hand are TWO PUNCTURE WOUNDS surrounded by a faint BLUE-WHITE PULSING GLOW. The GLOW disappears. \nPETER (mutters to himself) This is weird. My God, I feel so weird... \nHe leaps to his feet. He flexes. Feels weird. Good Weird. In fact, great weird! He tries a couple of \"jumping jacks\" and on the third jump he soars into the air! \nPETER (exhilarated) Very weird. \nThe great, bespangled, NEW YORK CITY is his backdrop as PETER jumps and turns and does loops in the air. With the agility and tactility of a spider, PETER leaps from the RAILING to a WALL to a FLAG POLE to another WALL where he lands sideways and sticks. \nPETER (sideways) Very, very weird. \nHe leaps off the WALL and lands at the edge of the roof. He looks down. No one's looking back. So, he takes a step back and leaps the alley to the next roof. \nEXT. ROOFTOP SHACK - NIGHT \nPETER lands on it. The next roof is seven stories up and across the street. PETER bites his lip. \nPETER Well, what the hell!! \nEXT. THE TALLER BUILDING - NIGHT \nBacklit by a FULL MOON, PETER somersaults to the roof of the taller building, and misses the top! \nHe sticks to the brick FACADE, upside down! He laughs with the moment. A WINDOW opens below him and a pretty BLONDE in a TOWEL sticks her head out. She looks this way and that, and all she sees is a MAN in a LOUD SPORTCOAT down the street. Never thinking to look up, she withdraws into the room. \nEXT. CHELSEA STREET - NIGHT \nThe MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT leans against a LAMP POST and lights a CIGARETTE with a BEAT UP, SILVER PLATED LIGHTER. \nIn the LIGHTER he sees a reflection of PETER leaping off the taller building. He snaps around and looks up in time to see PETER make it to the next FACADE. \nEXT. ROOFTOP MONTAGE - NIGHT \nWith the UPTOWN SKYLINE behind him, PETER casts caution to the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop. \nWatching from the street, the MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT follows PETER'S progress. \nThe CROWD BOOS the slender newcomer who climbs awkwardly through the ropes. Rock music blares. TWIN REDHEADS in RED BIKINIS ring a bell. \nCRUSHER COLE and SPIDER-MAN circle. COLE is twice SPIDEY'S size. SPIDEY spots a TV CAMERA for the first time. He momentarily freezes. CRUSHER sneers the CRUSHER sneer. Then he charges! \nWith the agility of a spider, SPIDEY leaps out of the way. CRUSHER comes back at him. SPIDEY leaps again, bigger! The acrobatics get more and more dramatic as CRUSHER COLE works himself up into a theatrical rage. Taunts erupt from the CROWD. \nOLD LADY Kill the sucker, Crusher! \nSPIDEY, really getting into it now, begins playing for the CAMERAS. \nHIPSTER (between two blondes) Whatsamatter, Crusher, can't you crush that bug? \nCRUSHER (to Spidey) Okay, Web Face, this is it! \nHe misses SPIDEY again! \nHIPSTER Hey, Crusher, you need a insecticide! (his blondes titter) \nINT. LIZ/KIM'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT \nLIZ'S side is all schoolwork. KIM'S side is all ROCK POSTERS and STUFFED ANIMALS. LIZ is curled up doing homework. FLASH and KIM sit on the edge of the bed watching the \"SLAMMIES\" on MTV. \nFLASH Will you look at this Spider-Man guy! He is absolutely incredible! \nKIM Liz, get a load of this outfit! I wish I had it for the Halloween party... it's quite sexy. \nLIZ Will you two shush. I'm trying to work. \nINT. RING - NIGHT \nThe match continues in an increasingly spectacular choreography. CRUSHER bellows at the SCREAMING CROWD. But there's a gleam in his eye. This is it! He charges. SPIDEY, playing the CAMERAS for all he's worth, leaps way, way up. But this time CRUSHER stops dead in his tracks. SPIDER-MAN comes back down into a forearm SMASH that sends him reeling into a corner. CRUSHER does a flying pin. 300 pounds. WOMP! The air leaves SPIDEY in a rush as CRUSHER covers him, smothering him. The CROWD goes WILD. \nREF One...! \nREISS Get up...! Get up...! \nREF Two...! \nNot realizing his own strength and panicky about being squashed, SPIDER-MAN throws CRUSHER COLE off him and up into the air. Way up! Reiss cheers... Spider-Man comes down and knocks CRUSHER for the first time. \nCRUSHER flies away and out of the arena, eight rows back! The HIPSTER sees CRUSHER coming at him and bolts from his seat. CRUSHER lands on it, in between the TWO BLONDES who break into utter hysterics. \nSPIDEY, surprised at his own strength, watches CRUSHER land. \nSPIDER-MAN (whispers to himself) Wow... \nREF Ladies and Gentlemen, history is made today, we have here the first man to win a thousand dollars against the mighty Crusher. \nThe REF raises his hand in victory. The CROWD BOOS and DEBRIS rains down. But some in the CROWD CHEER wildly, recognizing the new sensation. \nSPIDER-MAN steps down from the right as REISS leads the CHEERS. \nPETER Max! Am I really gonna get a thousand... \nREISS We are going to get a thousand-- \nPETER turns with REISS and comes face to face with CRUSHER COLE. Two ominous beats. \nCRUSHER Hi, who are you, kid? \nPETER I'm Peter Parker. \nREISS He is Spider-Man, and I handle him... Whenever you want a rematch call me. Next time it's gonna be ten thousand, what do you say... Crusher? \nSPIDER-MAN Oh, look, Mr. Crusher, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really... \nCRUSHER Oh, well, I don't know what happened to me tonight... (measures his muscles) I really don't know... \nREISS I know... you lost. Big man you lost to the Amazing Spider-Man. \nEXT. CITY STREET - NEAR A HOSPITAL - DAY \nWE ARE TIGHT ON A NEW YORK JOURNAL TRUCK. On its SIDE BANNER is a PICTURE of SPIDER-MAN'S face. Headline: \"Who is he? Mega-Smash Hits MTV!\" \nThe TRUCK pulls away and we see PETER, LIZ, HARRY and KIM standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross. PETER is rocking on his heels and smirking. \nPETER (indicating truck) You know who that is? \nLIZ (walking ahead) Yeah... he's some clown we saw on TV last night... boy does Flash think he's hot. \nPETER He does... \nKIM I love wrestling. \nHARRY Wrestling is all bluff. Do you really believe this little guy in a stupid Spider-Man suit beat the Crusher? \nLIZ Hey, we better rush... visiting hours will be over soon. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR & ROOM - DAY \nSPIDER-MAN You like wrestling? \nSPIDER-MAN jumps and reaches WEINER. \nWEINER I love it! You are the best wrestler I have ever seen... please don't hurt me! \nSPIDER-MAN picks up WEINER, throws him up to an antenna above the building, to which WEINER clings desperately. SPIDER-MAN circles the antenna. \nWEINER Oh, please... don't kill me. Please help me down. \nSPIDER-MAN Of course I'll help you down. I am Spider-Man... the good guy, am I not? \nWEINER Yes... yes, you are. \nSPIDER-MAN jumps to the CHIMNEY, picks WEINER up in his arms and whispers to him. \nSPIDER-MAN And by the way, Peter Parker does not live here anymore... \nSPIDER-MAN jumps with WEINER in his arms to the edge of the roof. \nSPIDER-MAN And tell the Professor he can't have Peter's data. Goodbye. \nSPIDER-MAN drops WEINER off the roof, three floors straight down into heavy bushes below. \nINT. ELECTRODYNE FACTORY SHOP - DAY \nA SIGN tells us so. A CLERK is double checking a long list of items OCK has ordered. \nCLERK Holy cow, whattaya building, fella, a cyclotron? (Ock glares at him) Okay... lets see here. Page three. We got 30,000 feet of 50-gauge copper co-ax... twin 550 XK transformers... cadmium accelerator rails, a half dozen... a GBC relative multi-phase transducer... and one yellow thermos. (finishes computation) That'll be $475,989.65... \nOCK Wrap it up... \nCLERK What about the money... or do you pay by credit card? \nOCK (a long beat) Cash! I'll be back soon. \nEXT. STREET - OUTSIDE OF A BANK - BACK DOOR - NIGHT \nAn ARMORED TRUCK rolls by and stops. TWO GUARDS open the Bank's DOORS. \nSuddenly a WALDO smashes through the DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW of the ARMORED TRUCK, wrapping around the DRIVER'S NECK and pulling him through the WINDOW. The SHOTGUN goes for his weapon, but a WALDO smashes in and pulls the GUN out through his WINDOW. \nTWO WALDOS shoot out and attach themselves to the REAR DOOR. \nBANK GUARD What's going on here? \nThe WALDO knocks him over. OCK rips the DOOR off! The TRUCK is full of MONEY BAGS. \nOCK Cash! \nINT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY \nA PHOTO ASSISTANT look on as JAMESON goes over PETER'S latest PHOTOS. They are his SPIDER-MAN shots. \nPETER Doesn't he look amazing in that one? Look, he's flying in the air! \nJAMESON I don't care if he flies to the moon. He's just another wrestler in a silly costume. Look at this, Parker, right off the wire. This is the guy who hit that armored truck this morning. They say he has metal arms... get me a picture of this character! \nPETER Metal arms? \nJAMESON Four of them. \nPETER Ock...?! \nJAMESON The web faced weirdo... He is a joke in a Halloween costume... don't make me laugh. \nHe tears up PETER'S SPIDEY PHOTOS. \nJAMESON Now get out of here and don't come back without something I can use! \nPETER Yes sir... (stops, and turns back) \nJAMESON A mega baloney... A bug in blue tights... what next? \nPETER The Journal said he was a mega-smash on MTV... \nINT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT \nWEINER is putting on a CLOWN SUIT. He fastidiously puts his ratty jacket on a hanger and hangs it on a PIPE. The PIPE turns into a snake. It is, in fact, a WALDO! \nOCK (turning from work) What do you think you're doing? \nWEINER I'm going to the Masquerade. It's Halloween tonight Doc, aren't you coming to the School Ball? Whoa, you could go without an outfit. \nA WALDO whips around WEINER'S throat... AARRRGH! \nOCK You're not going to any ball, clown. You're going to get me Peter Parker's data... \nWEINER I was almost killed on my last try... Look at all these bruises... \nLIZ I'm not... \nShe reaches for HARRY'S hand. \nFLASH Holy jumping jelly beans, willya look at these pictures of Spider-Man? Wow! Is this guy great or what? \nLIZ looks. She shrugs. Then she shrieks. \nLIZ Hey, Peter! These are your pictures! \nFLASH Can't be... \nLIZ It says here \"Photos by Peter Parker.\" \nPETER reacts, then looks over FLASH'S other shoulder. \nINSERT: There are three PHOTOS of SPIDER-MAN in the paper. PETER BLUSHES, smiling. \nFLASH (takes off his head mask) You know this guy, Parker? \nPETER Well, yeah... sort of... \nFLASH Wow... I'll give you anything if you introduce us. \nHARRY (to Liz) Will you grant me this dance...? \nLIZ joins him provocatively. \nKIM Hey, Flash-Man... Wanna dance...? \nFLASH Well, why not. \nPETER is left alone, PETER leaves toward the entrance. At the REAR DOOR a BIG LIZARD passes a NOTE to a DALLAS COWGIRL who passes it to a KANGAROO. The KANGAROO hops across the dance floor to the STAGE where he hands the NOTE to a YOUNG WOMAN in a BASEBALL UNIFORM. \nShe climbs the STAGE where she is bathed in a SPOTLIGHT. She gets a DRUM ROLL from the band. There are some BOOS as the bad stops. \nYOUNG WOMAN Thank you, thank you. We have a special surprise guest tonight. (booo) The Empire State University Masquerade Ball presents... The \"Slammy\" winning star of MTV'S wrestling tournament... The Amazing Spider-Man! \nFLASH, amazed turns to LIZ. He points to himself and mouths, \"Me?\" (The REAL) SPIDEY drops from the ceiling and lands in a pose. The CROWD cheers. He does a flip to LIZ and extends a hand. The BAND starts up. LIZ demurs. \nFLASH (whispers firmly) Go ahead... go ahead! \nLIZ takes SPIDEY'S hand and they move slowly and sexily onto the dance floor. They do a short simple number. SPIDEY returns LIZ to FLASH. \nLIZ (to Flash) Come on... Flash... \nFLASH takes LIZ from PETER (SPIDER-MAN). \nLIZ and FLASH dance wildly. They finish to big cheers. The real SPIDER-MAN slides to center floor. The crowd backs away as SPIDEY spins out the greatest dance number in film history. He's all over the floor and on the walls and on the ceiling and on the GLITTER BALL. He takes LIZ and flies with her. He breaks the place up. Then drops in a pose. BIG CHEERS. \nLIZ stops breathless, very near to SPIDER-MAN'S face. \nLIZ (whispers breathless) Who are you...? \nPETER One day you'll know... \nLIZ (a long beat) You sound very familiar. \nPETER/SPIDER-MAN Sure I do... I'm your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man! \nHe jumps away and disappears, leaving the CROWD aghast and LIZ in love. \nINT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT \nBEN is flicking through the channels of his TV, aggravated as usual. It's all ROCK VIDEOS! \nBEN (to May) What a bunch of crap. Goddamn rock and roll's screwed up the whole TV. \nHe flicks off the set and turns to MAY who's asleep on the couch. He gently nudges her. \nBEN Come on, May. Wake up and go to sleep. \nEXT. TAXI - NIGHT \nIt enters the EAST RIVER DRIVE. \nINT. TAXI - NIGHT \nAs the city rolls by. \nSPIDER-MAN (fearful) Hey! Can't you go any faster? \nCABBIE What'm I in, a race? \nSPIDER-MAN (fighting his fear) I don't know... I get this tingling in my brain, like some danger is lurking just ahead. I'm worried about Aunt May and Uncle Ben... \nCABBIE Your family? \nSPIDER-MAN Well, they are kind of my parents. They raised me. I lost both of my parents in a car accident... please step on it! \nBEN Let go before I blow your brain's out. \nEXT. FOREST HILLS STREET - NIGHT \nThe TRUCK pulls away leaving PETER in a POOL of STREET LAMP LIGHT. He's wearing a FOOTBALL JERSEY and SHORTS and carrying a SPORTS BAG. He begins to run. \nINT. BEN AND MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMAY hears a CRASH. She pulls the covers up around her chin in fear. \nBEN (V.O.) Let go! \nWEINER (V.O.) You let go! \nEXT. BEN AND MAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nPETER runs up and hears a SHOT. He runs inside. \nINT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT \nPETER runs in. He sees WEINER standing there with the RIFLE. They face off across the room. The moment hits PETER like a punch in the chest. \nPETER Uncle Ben! \nBEN (a wheeze) Peter... \nPETER rushes to BEN. \nPETER Oh my God... Uncle Ben... \nPETER tries to revive BEN, while WEINER runs out. \nINT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT \nPLASTIC FURNITURE, GARISH LIGHTING, CIGARETTES in the ASHTRAYS. \nAUNT MAY (a brave but fragile front) Ben gets through everything. He'll be alright. The doctors are... \nAUNT MAY and PETER embrace, leaning on each other for support. \nDETECTIVE (compassionate) Excuse me. You the nephew? \nPETER rises, nods. As AUNT MAY wipes away a sniffle... \nDETECTIVE Your uncle's a brave man. Apparently, the perpetrator was after something of yours. Your uncle didn't know what it was but he stood up to him anyway. You ought to be proud of him. \nPETER I am... how is he... \nA grim-faced DOCTOR walks slowly across the room to them... MAY stands up slowly. \nDETECTIVE Ask the Doctor. \nAUNT MAY How's my... how's my husband doing...? \nDOCTOR Mrs. Parker, I'm sorry. We tried. \nMAY collapses. \nDOCTOR Crash cart! STAT! \nThe Detective pulls PETER gently away. The STAFF works on MAY. \nDETECTIVE Let the medics handle it. (pause) Look, if it makes you feel any better. We're gonna nail this guy. He crashed his getaway car. We got him trapped in a warehouse on Jackson. \nNURSE (to Peter) She's alright. She just fainted. We'll have to check her for symptoms of shock. If you want to wait, you can get some coffee on the third floor. \nPETER No, I... I think I wanna go out for some fresh air. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nCOP CARS, COPS, SEARCHLIGHTS playing their BEAMS against the ACME CHEMICAL STORAGE BUILDING. GUNFIRE flashes from one of the WINDOWS. \nEXT. COP CAR - NIGHT \nELITE COPS in BASEBALL CAPS are plotting strategy. \nCOP #1 That place is loaded with solvents and chemicals. If we blast our way in, it's gonna go up like a roman candle. \nCOP #2 We could go in through the fifth floor wash room. \nCOP #1 What's that up there? Throw a light on that! \nCOP #1 directs the BEAM of the SEARCHLIGHT. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE WALL - NIGHT \nSPIDER-MAN is climbing it, trapped in the GLARE of the SEARCHLIGHT. He freezes. \nCOP #1 He's got a partner! \nOCK (holding Liz) Who the hell are you? \nSPIDER-MAN Spider-Man. \nLIZ (seeing Spidey) Spider-Man... \nOCK That's a lot of crap, clown... I am Spider-Man, not you. (points to Liz) Ask you girlfriend. (to Liz) Tell him! \nSPIDER-MAN I'm a good friend of Peter Parker's Ock. Just like that girl you're holding. Now let her go. \nOCK thinks for a moment, then he begins to extend the kicking and screaming LIZ out over the street, ten stories up. \nOCK Let her go? What an excellent idea. If you do not deliver your friend, Mr. Spider-Man, yes. Yes, of course, I'll let her go. \nLIZ Put me down, you mechanical mutant! \nLIZ is having none of this. She kicks, she fights. She twists. She flails around, making things a little worse. The ground is yawning death beneath her. RRIIPP! PART of her BLOUSE tears away and LIZ plummets! SPIDER-MAN swoops down on a WEB-STRAND in his characteristic compound curve. He reaches out for the falling LIZ and misses her cleanly. The WEB is too short. \nLIZ (falling away) You jerk! \nHe THWIPS her with a second WEB and together they swing to a HIGH GIRDER where he deposits her safe and sound. \nLIZ (straightening herself) Tell your friend Peter next time I'll get the taxi myself... \nOCK (screams) Hey... you jerk... you phony Spider-Man... Prepare to meet your death, bug. \nSPIDEY THWIPS a beam and swings across toward OCK. \nSPIDER-MAN (whispers) Actually, I'm rather fond of living... especially now... (he looks at Liz) \nHe lands on OCK'S GIRDER and the two progeny of the cyclotron face off for the first time, ten stories above the street. \nSPIDER-MAN (a last appeal to reason) Octavius. Just stop and think. \nOCK I am thinking, insect. I'm thinking about exterminating you! \nSPIDER-MAN Okay, if that's the way you want it... Let's see what those chrome knuckles can do, Doc... \nA WALDO lances out and catches SPIDEY flush on the jaw. It knocks him to another GIRDER. SPIDEY hangs on and rolls over. He rubs his jaw. \nLIZ Great... \nSPIDEY gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by another barrage of blows from above. \nOCK Now I must kill you, you cretinous clown. \nOCK throws a roundhouse WALDO that nearly knocks SPIDEY off the GIRDER. He's just barely hanging on. But SPIDER-MAN'S not done yet. He THWIPS a HIGH BEAM and swings into a better attack position. The two SUPER- ADVERSARIES engage in battle. \nWith OCK swinging from his WALDOS like a metal monkey and SPIDEY swinging from his WEBS like, well, like SPIDEY, they clang and bang through the GIRDERS of the CONSTRUCTION SITE. \nOCK Once I dispose of you, Spider-Man, no one will be able to stop me. \nSPIDER-MAN Stop you from what...? \nOCK My destiny! \nOCK throws his biggest punch yet. \nSIRENS can now be heard in the street. \nSPIDEY avoids WALDO strike after WALDO strike. OCK eludes WEB after WEB. But SPIDEY'S agility soon has him turning circles. \nSPIDER-MAN Over here, Octopus! \nOCK That's Professor Octopus to you Spider Jerk! \nSPIDER-MAN Give it up, Professor. You'll never catch me! \nOCK takes three steps and soars through the air. \nEXT. BRICK WALL - NIGHT \nOCK, misjudging the leap, soars right past SPIDEY and into an alley! Screaming all the way... \nEXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT \nOCK and TWO WALDOS pressed against each of the opposing walls. It's a tenuous grip. Then, very slowly, sparks flying from his WALDOS, OCK slides down into the alley. \nSPIDER-MAN So long, sucker. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nCOP CARS pull up. COPS leap from them. \nEXT. SIDE WALL - NIGHT \nOCK makes it down, sees the COPS, ducks out of sight. \nEXT. COP CARS - NIGHT \nSPIDER-MAN Thanks. \nFLASH (realizing) By the way, what are you doing with... Liz? \nSPIDER-MAN She needed a lift. \nFLASH Oh... okay! This calls for a beer! A lot of beer! \nSPIDER-MAN Thanks, but I have some business to take care of. \nFLASH Well... take care of that later. Wait here. I'll get the beer. \nHe disappears. LIZ comes, tentatively, to the WINDOW where SPIDEY squats, desire and passion in his WHITE EYES. \nLIZ (accusatory) How'd you know this was Flash's place? \nSPIDER-MAN Peter Parker told me all about it. \nLIZ Peter told you all about Flash? \nSPIDER-MAN No... he told me all about you. See you later. (he jumps away) \nINT. DORM - NIGHT \nFLASH comes in with more BEER than a man ought to carry. \nFLASH Hey, where'd he go? Hey, Spider-Man!! \nBut SPIDER-MAN has disappeared. \nLIZ (distracted) Peter told your Hero all about me... \nFLASH He would, wouldn't he... that jerk! \nEXT. PETER PARKER'S ROOF - NIGHT \nSPIDER-MAN lands on it. He drops in the SKYLIGHT. \nINT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHe drops into the room and pulls off his MASK. The place has been ransacked. COMPUTER DISCS are all over the floor. PETER pulls a file marked \"Planetary Conjunction.\" He opens it. \nA piece of PAPER falls out. It says, \"Kiss it goodbye, Wall Crawler!\" \nPETER (whispers angrily) Octavius!!! \nEXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY QUAD - DAY \nPETER is hurrying along. KIM in sunning herself wonderfully. \nPETER (hurrying by) Kim! Have you seen Harry? \nKIM Sure, lots of times. What a brainiac... \nPETER Yeah... have you seen him today? \nKIM No, un unh. \nLIZ (catching up) Peter...! \nPETER (keeps walking) Hi... have you seen Harry? \nLIZ No. What a night, huh? \nPETER (laughs) Yeah, that was some ride home... must have been pretty exciting. \nLIZ It was... okay. Look, I got two tickets to Les Miserables... wanna go? \nPETER Sorry... I'm really busy... I mean, not tonight... see you later. \nLIZ (thinking) Hey, Peter... how did you know about last night...? \nPETER What about last night? \nLIZ My exciting ride with Spider-Man... \nPETER Oh... Sorry... I gotta hurry... I have to find Harry... I'll see you later. \nLIZ Peter! \nPETER runs off. He sees a car approach and flags it. \nPETER Hey! Can I get a lift downtown? \nFLASH Take your shoes for a walk, Dork. \nFLASH gets out of his car, and crosses the lawn toward LIZ. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY \nPETER What is it? \nHARRY Let me see. It's some kind of countdown clock. \nPETER Countdown to what? \nHARRY I don't know, but whatever it is, it's only six hours away. \nPETER The Planetary Conjunction? \nHARRY Could be... \nPETER Or Doc Ock's end of the world experiment... Or both! \nHARRY Wait a minute. You're not telling me you think the world is gonna end tonight...? \nPETER You want to wait around till midnight to find out? \nHARRY No, but... \nPETER Let's see what else we've got. \nAnother set of numbers roll up on the SCREEN. They are accompanied by ELECTRICAL SYMBOLS. \nHARRY What's that? \nPETER It might be a calculation of the amount of power he needs to create the hole between the force and the anti-force. \nHARRY That's a lot of energy. What could generate power like that? \nPETER The closest you could come is the New York City Subway System. \nAgain, the lights flicker and then dim and they return. \nHARRY/PETER (together) We gotta talk to Professor Rosomorf!! \nINT. BROADWAY EXPRESS - NIGHT \nROZ boards and takes a seat. There are the usual SUBWAY TYPES. A FAT WOMAN. A PIMPLY TEENAGER and his date, a TALL SKINNY GIRL in a PARTY DRESS. \nROZ, making notations in a PAD, takes no notice of them. He sits down, closes his PAD, and taps a PENCIL against his chin. \nROZ Plutonium... \nEXT. MAJOR INTERSECTION - NIGHT \nTAXIS go by. TWO LOVERS stroll. We hear a familiar WHINE. The \"WALK\" and \"DON'T WALK\" signs FLASH at the same time. \nBOY Make up your mind! \nThe signs EXPLODE! The COUPLE stops in their tracks. The BOY looks at the GIRL. \nGIRL What's going on? \nAn ARC of ELECTRICITY now shoots between the LIGHT PILLARS of the SUBWAY STATION on the corner. \nINT. BROADWAY LOCAL - NIGHT \nSPARKS fly by the window. ROZ, oblivious at first, is now stunned by the show. \nEXT. SUBWAY TRAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nThe ARCS of ELECTRICITY continue to rise. The STREET LIGHTS buckle and bend into weird shapes. \nWOMAN Oh my God! \nMAN Get back! Get back! \nEXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT \nTWO TAXIS roar through the intersection and COLLIDE. The ETHNIC DRIVERS leap out and begin arguing. \nINT. TRAIN - NIGHT \nPEOPLE SCREAM and fall back as the TRAIN seems to change angles. \nEXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nA building ROAR rises from the SUBWAY ENTRANCE. Then the sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE! The BOY looks down the STAIRS and has to leap out of the way as the BROADWAY EXPRESS comes highballing up the STEPS and blasts through the SUBWAY entrance. \nThe TRAIN sails through the air. \nEXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT \nThe TRAIN crashes into the building in a storm of cyclotron generated Dali physics. \nEXT. THE STREET - NIGHT \nThe THROB and PULSE recede. SCREAMS, HONKS, SIRENS can be heard. \nSPIDEY arrives at the DOOR at the top of the CAR. He sees ROZ at the bottom. THREE PEOPLE are between them. The SKINNY GIRL sees SPIDEY. She screams. \nSPIDER-MAN Okay, folks, just hang on... \nHe scampers down the GRAB-HANDLES to the people below. FOUR PASSENGERS cling to SEATS and BARS. \nSPIDER-MAN Okay, one at a time. You first, Ma'am... \nA FAT WOMAN makes a \"who me?\" gesture. SPIDEY throws her over his shoulder. \nINSERT: THE COUPLING which holds the two CARS at right angles begins to bend open. \nSPIDER-MAN, the FAT WOMAN over his shoulder, goes hand over hand to the top and the WOMAN is dumped into the MIDDLE CAR. \nINSERT: THE COUPLING bends open a little more. \nSPIDEY helps the TEENAGER and the SKINNY GIRL out of the CAR. She takes the dreadful step between cars. She looks down. She screams. She steps across. \nEXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT \nThe FIRE LADDER is up. But it is about TEN FEET short of where it's aimed at. The end of the CAR. A FIREMAN stands at its apex. \nFIREMAN (into walkie) Gimme more ladder! I need more ladder! \nWALKIE Negative on that, you're at full extension! \nINT. LAST CAR - NIGHT \nNow only ROZ is left. SPIDEY approaches him. He clings to a POLE. \nINSERT: The COUPLING bends open! The CAR is hanging there from memory! \nROZ This is Doctor Otto Octavius' work. I must get back to my university. I must stop Ock... he's gone crazy. Can you help me? \nSPIDER-MAN Sure thing, just don't take the train. Come on... give me your hand. \nROZ Spider-Man! Listen to me! If he can do this with the train, if he's come this far, then I can pretty well predict his next step. He'll go to Plutonium SL 270 for the power. He must be stopped... or else he'll destroy our world. \nThe COUPLING shrieks and the CAR lurches. \nSPIDER-MAN Let's get you out of here first, Professor. \nROZ Wait Spider-Man. I don't think I can make it... You mustn't waste time saving me... you must save the world! You must go and stop Ock! \nSPIDER-MAN Where can I find him...? \nROZ He is looking for Plutonium SL 270 I'm sure... \nThe CAR lurches on its side and ROZ flies out of the DOOR. SPIDEY THWIPS out a WEB that girdles ROZ'S waist. \nSPIDER-MAN Think Rosomorf, think where one can find Plutonium? Where could he find SL 270...? \nEXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT \nROZ is hanging in mid-air on the WEB. ROZ shouts. \nROZ (shouting) There's only one place he can get the Plutonium SL 270... \nSPIDER-MAN Where...? \nROZ Toxic... toxic dump... any toxic dump would have SL 270. \nSPIDEY swings ROZ in an arc to the FIREMAN. He misses ROZ on the first pass. ROZ looks up at SPIDEY who stands in the doorway, manipulating the WEB. \nThe FIREMAN grabs ROZ. Then, with an awful SCREECH of steel, the CAR pulls loose from the COUPLING. With SPIDER-MAN inside it, the CAR plunges ten stories to the street below. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nCOPS, FIREMEN, PRESS, the works. The CROWD GASPS. CAMERA STROBES pop as the LAST CAR crashes to the SIDEWALK. We hold several beats on the incredible rubble. \nThen, a WEBBED HAND. SPIDER-MAN groggily pulls himself from the wreckage. \nCOP (V.O.) Put your hands up, Spider-Man. \nSPIDER-MAN You're making a big mistake. \nCOP And you're looking at twenty years. \nSPIDER-MAN shoots a WAD of WEB GOO onto the COP'S GUN and leaps up onto the LUXURY CONDO... and swings up out of the frame. The COP aims and shoots. The BULLET makes a THWUMP noise. The WEB GOO stretches out about three feet and falls limp. \nCOP What the hell! \nEXT. BACK OF BUILDING - NIGHT \nSPIDER-MAN swings painfully, one handed and limp, at the end of a WEB STRAND. After falling ten stories, he is groggy and weak. He can't think. He can't focus. He can barely hold onto his WRIST GIZMOS. This bug is spent. \nSPIDER-MAN Must go on... must find Ock... SL 270 Plutonium... must get that crazy old loony... before he gets to the Plutonium... toxic dump... where are the toxic dumps...? \nHe hangs there with two hands to catch his breath and thinks. He shoots a WEB up diagonally and swings across on it. This time he catches on and holds, but barely. \nFLASH Spider-man! This is unbelievable...! \nSPIDER-MAN Flash, I need your help. \nFLASH You got it. \nSPIDER-MAN You any good with this thing? \nFLASH I'm the best. \nSPIDER-MAN Okay... catch that Vette! \nFLASH Roger, wilco, over and out. \nHe swerves. SPIDEY falls all over LIZ. They begin to careen through traffic, three peas in a very small pod. \nEXT. WEST SIDE CAR CHASE MONTAGE - NIGHT \nWith SPIDEY jammed in between LIZ and FLASH, the MG chases the VETTE. Since neither OCK nor FLASH is any good at this, both cars quickly careen into POLES, FENCES, HOT DOG CARS and begin falling apart. \nOn RIVERSIDE DRIVE the MG begins to lurch and STEAM. The VETTE looks eaten away. The GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE looms ahead. \nThe VETTE roars through the TOLL BOOTH. They spot OCK stuck in traffic. \nFLASH Why is he going to New Jersey, and who is it in that shitty red car... \nLIZ Don't you recognize him... it's Ock! \nSPIDER-MAN New Jersey has the largest toxic waste dump in the world. \nFLASH What does he want with toxic waste? \nSPIDER-MAN He's looking for Plutonium, my dear... The car has to slow down... it's in a traffic jam. \nFLASH Sorry... can't do anything about this traffic. \nSPIDER-MAN jumps out of the car. \nSPIDER-MAN Try to stay with me. I don't want to lose him! \nSpeeding along the BRIDGE, OCK sees no one. But high above, SPIDEY swings from TOWER to TOWER after him. At the last TOWER, SPIDEY leaps down onto a BIG TRUCK. The VETTE weaves and SPIDEY crosses to another BIG TRUCK. For a moment he is caught between the TWO TRUCKS, but he makes it across. \nThe VETTE takes an exit. SPIDEY leaps to the next SIGN. He aims his WRIST GIZMO and waits for the next car to take the exit, but none does. Deflated, he drops to the ground. He looks up to see a sign on a CYCLONE FENCE. It says, \"DUMP NUMBER 7 -- KEEP OUT -- RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!\" \nSPIDER-MAN Bingo. \nINT. TOXIC WASTE DUMP - NIGHT \nThe landscape has a nightmarish vision, weirdly lit by \"safety lights.\" VATS and DRUMS ooze all kinds of bad stuff. A light is on in a dilapidated SHACK. \nINT. THE SHACK - NIGHT \nOCK is tossing away the CANISTERS until he comes to one marked, \"HAZARD!! PLUTONIUM SL 270 HAZARD!!\" \nOCK Okey, dokey... \nSPIDER-MAN Open that now, and you'll spoil Christmas. \nSPIDEY'S peering in from a HOLE in the ROOF. \nOCK Insect! I am going to squash you to death... Once I lay my Waldos on your skinny bones... \nOCK hurls a DRUM at SPIDEY. It erupts in a sizzle of LIQUID and GAS. Then the SIX-ARMED FIEND runs for the door with his SL 270. \nEXT. THE SHACK - NIGHT \nOCK comes flying out and SPIDER-MAN grabs a WALDO. SPIDEY does a back flip and whips OCK so hard the WALDO snaps off! OCK recoils it and reacts in horror. With a roar, OCK attacks SPIDER-MAN. They battle as SUPER-ADVERSARIES. OCK gains the upper hand and tosses SPIDEY into a pile of RUSTING DRUMS. A GAS envelopes SPIDER-MAN and he begins coughing. \nEXT. THE DUMP - NIGHT \nOCK'S WALDOS are coiled around SPIDER-MAN'S neck as the WEB SLINGER is dragged through the dump. His WHITE EYES narrow and blink. There is a capped WELL behind a WARNING SIGN. OCK tears off the CAP and then hurls the groggy SPIDEY down the WELL. \nOCK Goodbye, Spider-Man! \nINT. THE WELL - NIGHT \nSPIDEY falls. He cannot grab onto the slimy WALLS. At the bottom of the foul pit is a bubbling BLUE luminescent POOL. SPIDEY claws frantically at the WALLS. \nSPIDER-MAN Noooooooooooooo! \nHe gets a hold and slides down to within a foot of the POOL. Its weird light shines up at him. He looks up at the starry sky. \nSPIDER-MAN (to himself) Okay now, Spidey. Easy does it. \nHe shoots a WEB about halfway up the PIT. It hits the wall, sizzles, and drops back down. \nSPIDER-MAN (to himself) Don't give up, Spidey. Don't give up. \nThe WEB GIZMO squirts out a pathetic patooey of WEB GOO. Then it hisses, empty! \nHARRY But don't worry... he can never use it without Plutonium. \nSPIDER-MAN (V.O.) He's got the Plutonium, and he's on his way back to the lab! And he's got two prisoners with him... Liz and Flash! \nHARRY Don't worry... he needs a huge amount of power... thousands of volts of electricity... to get to the Anti-Force. \nSPIDER-MAN He can get to the power. Electrical power... to the max. Nuclear power... SL 270. And now, at the moment of full Planetary Conjunction. When all the planets line up with the sun... maximum gravitational power. The Conjunction is Ock's final power source. \nHARRY Damn... the Conjunction is due at midnight! What are we going to do? \nEXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT \nThe BLUE MG arrives and comes to a stop. OCK looks at his two prisoners in the back seat and smiles to himself... Picks up one DRUM on each shoulder. \nOCK Okey, dokey... have fun, young ones... for the last time. \nOCK leaves. LIZ and FLASH are tied together in the back seat of the CAR. \nLIZ (still ministering) What do we do now? \nFLASH We kiss the world goodbye. If he is right, all there is left to do is... \nLIZ Wait... I think I can release my right hand... \nINT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHARRY How much time is left? Wait... I can find out... my God... 59 minutes! \nINT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT \nSPIDER-MAN The only way we can interfere with Ock's plan is to find a computer center... fast. \nHARRY (V.O.) Our University has the biggest center in town. \nSPIDER-MAN Yeah, but who's gonna work 'em? \nEXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT \nProfessor OCK comes for some more drums. He sees that LIZ and FLASH have disappeared. OCK picks up TWO DRUMS. HARRY seeing FLASH and LIZ come running to the school grounds. \nHARRY I think I can get some help... I can teach anyone how to work a code in five minutes. \nSPIDER-MAN (V.O.) Then do it! \nINT. COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT \nThe LIGHTS are off, but the COMPUTERS are on. HARRY looks over LIZ'S shoulder as she cracks through a code. Her SCREEN reads out, \"CONNECTICUT. TECH. Fully Op, Line Backlog, Security Max Level.\" The last line is FLASHING. \nKIM Hey, this is easy. \nThey all run from COMPUTER to COMPUTER. \nFLASH Hey, Harry I need help. \nHARRY Coming! \nHARRY types in KARNAKY LTD and gets the same response. He looks at his DIGITAL WRISTWATCH. \"01:00:02\" becomes \"00:59:59\" as we watch. Then a WARNING BUZZER! \nKIM I got one! I got one! \nLIZ Harry! Get over here! \nHARRY hurries to KIM'S side and elbows her out of the CHAIR. The SCREEN is flashing \"WARNING, Security Breach!\" HARRY'S hands fly over the keys. The KIDS gather around. LINE DRAWINGS of the CYCLOTRON (progressing from large to small detail) appear one after the other. Finally, a PIPE. There is a CIRCLE around a JOINT. And the legend \"H20\". \nHARRY A goddamn water leak... \nFLASH Hey, look at this. Empire State University. This is our cyclotron, right? \nHARRY (serious) What does it say? \nFLASH (hits two keys) It says \"no information on net.\" \nHARRY Damn... we can't do it... \nKIM You mean... we can't stop loony Ock... \nHARRY I mean the world is in danger... \nFLASH We must find Peter, he knows these computers better than all of us. \nHARRY Yes, but where the hell is he? \nLIZ (mysteriously) I bet he is with Spider-Man... \nSuddenly the lights dim. A heavy noise. An earth quake. \nEXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK \nThe EARTH is moving into line with the other PLANETS of the CONJUNCTION. \nOCK throws the RED POWER THROTTLE to 97% POWER. Cacophony! The \"BULLET\" begins to PULSE and THROB! The DIALS spin! The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, \"00:05:58\". \nEXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT \nThe FULL MOON hangs over the building. FLASH and HARRY and KIM stand at the entrance to the CENTER. FLASH starts to run to the building. \nFLASH (screaming) Liz! Liz come on out! \nThey run forward but as they reach the FRONT STEPS the building lurches upward. The bottom step becomes a wall of STONE and DIRT, six feet high. \nHARRY Get back! Flash... get back! \nFLASH Wow...! \nThen the building lurches upward again! This time it pulls FREE from the ground. The KIDS take cover as WATER LINES BURST and ELECTRICAL WIRES SPARK. \nINT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - NIGHT \nLIZ opens a door. \nLIZ Peter! \nThe building lurches throwing her back across the HALL where she crashes through another door. \nINT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT \nAll manner of stuff is flying around. LIZ comes sliding across the floor. She crashes into a CABINET. GLASSWARE starts to fall on her, but crashes into the CEILING instead. She is dragged up the WALL. She kicks and screams against the Anti-Force. \nEXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT \nFLASH, KIM and HARRY look on as heavy ELECTRICAL CABLES stretch upward to the rising CENTER and then snap in showers of sparks. As they fall away the CENTER becomes airborne. The CABLES wave up at it, shooting arcs of ELECTRICITY directly at the building. \nINT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT \nLIZ slides down the WALL. She grabs at the WINDOW and looks out. The rest of the university recedes beneath her, now a hundred feet below. And they're still rising! FLASH and HARRY look up. \nFLASH Oh my God... Liz is inside there! \nHARRY And Professor Rosomorf and crazy Ock. \nFLASH What about Peter? Is he there with them? \nHARRY No, but I bet Spider-Man is. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF UNIVERSITY - NIGHT \nPeople look up at the SCIENCE CENTER. A CYCLIST, riding and looking, crashes into a TAXI. MAX REISS leaps out with the BEAUTIFUL STARLET from the TAXI. \nMAX That's some show... if ever I saw one. \nINT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nHe's looking out his window seeing the University's Lab Building flying by. Up and up toward the sky. \nJAMESON (shouting) Tear out the front page! Change the headline... The biggest news is happening right now... we need photos... a camera... get me a camera...! \nEXT. SKY - NIGHT \nA very long shot of the SCIENCE CENTER rising into the CLOUDS. \nINT. AUNT MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nShe pulls aside a CURTAIN and watches the SCIENCE CENTER rise. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nOCK works the COMPUTER as the CONSOLE sends up SHOWERS of SPARKS. He glances at the \"BULLET\" which now PULSES. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK at \"00:04:18\". \nROZ Where is it going Otto? \nOCK Other worlds, Roz, other times, other dimensions, who knows? Who cares? \nROZ Then... why? \nOCK Truth, Rosomorf. Look at it! The new truth! The new way! \nSPIDER-MAN Don't listen to him Professor Roz. \nOCK No, you don't listen to that clown, he can't save you, or the world for that matter. \nA WALDO reaches in and rips ROZ off SPIDEY, flinging him back against a WALL. ROZ lands in a heap beneath a FIRE STATION (HOSE, EXTINGUISHER, AXE). \nWe see the WALDO reach out for SPIDER-MAN. It wraps around his FOOT and begins to tug, slowly... \nOCK Once and for all, Spider-Man... once and for all we'll end the legend of your powers. \nOCK knocks SPIDER-MAN with a real BIG BLOW with his WALDO. OCK is slowly dragging SPIDER-MAN to a HUGE HOLE that's been ripped in the floor by the BEAMS of ELECTRICITY. We see New York a half a mile down through the hole. We see SPIDEY being drawn across the HOLE. Then ROZ comes flying in with the FIRE AXE. \nROZ hacks away at the WALDO and chops it off! The stump withdraws. OCK examines it in pain and fury! \nSPIDER-MAN (similarly braced) I don't know!!! \nLIZ starts to slip away into the flow. She struggles against it. \nLIZ I can't... hold on! \nSPIDEY THWIPS her and she grabs onto the WEB. \nSPIDER-MAN Hold tight, Liz, hold tight! \nOCK drops calmly, beatifically, to the floor of the room. He moves slowly, under his own power, into the LIGHT. \nOCK (spaced out) You cut my power... there's too little power... It's so tiny... so tiny... there's only space... for me. But I've done it, Spider-Man. I have broken through... I've broken through! \nLIZ Don't do it, Dr. Octavius! \nOCK Okey... dokey... Now that's what I call an experiment!!! \nAs he nears the LIGHT he actually becomes a part of it. He radiates LIGHT. He shimmers and shines. He fills the room with BLINDING LIGHT. \nSPIDEY and LIZ shield their eyes, and as the light diminishes, the storm subsides. They're safe. Except for the fact that they're in a floating building, 10,000 feet above the city! \nEXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT \nAgainst the backdrop of the MOON, a SQUADRON of HELICOPTERS approaches the CENTER. From their POV, a HUGE CRACK opens across the face of the building. The CENTER begins to drop in PULSING SURGES. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nSPIDER-MAN is at the CONSOLE pulling and putting back WIRES. LIZ, fascinated, looks in at the WINDOW where OCK disappeared. \nSPIDER-MAN I can't control her. She's dropping too fast! Alright... let's go! \nLIZ But what about Peter? We've got to find Peter! \nSPIDER-MAN Peter will be okay, I promise you... Let's go before it's too late. (he grabs her) \nLIZ Go where? \nEXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT \nIt rotates and drops. The HELICOPTERS come in like the cavalry. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nTrying to leave it, LIZ and SPIDEY are confronted with a nightmare. The room is tilted at a 45% angle. PIPES are bursting. SPIDEY helps LIZ through the obstacles. Debris rains down. They come face to face with a diagonal maze of PIPES. \nSPIDER-MAN Maybe there's another way... \nA HUGE CRACK opens above them. \nLIZ It's breaking apart! \nSPIDER-MAN Alright, keep moving, a step at a time! \nThey scale the maze, but as they emerge on the other side, half the floor falls away! Central Park awaits, 8,000 feet below. \nLIZ We have to go back. \nSPIDER-MAN We can't go back. \nHe looks across at the door. It is midway up a diagonal wall. He shoots a WEB up at the ceiling between themselves and the door. Then he extends a hand to LIZ. \nLIZ Forget it... \nSPIDER-MAN Okay, have it your way. \nHe swings across and lands on the LEDGE of the DOOR. Then he swings the WEB back to her like a trapeze. LIZ catches the WEB and looks across at SPIDER-MAN, furious. \nLIZ (shouting across) What am I supposed to do with this! \nSPIDER-MAN (shouting back) Go ahead. It's easier than it looks! We've got to try the fire escape. \nLIZ swings across like TARZAN and SPIDEY gathers her in on the LEDGE. She does a comic \"phew\" and the LEDGE buckles beneath them but holds. SPIDER-MAN tries to open the door, but it's stuck. \nLIZ The door is stuck. \nSPIDER-MAN bends his back to the task. It take all his strength, but with a comic AAAAARGGHH! He bends the DOOR open. \nEXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT \nThey burst out onto the ROCK FOUNDATION of the building. New York is rushing up to meet them. The WIND created by their fall buffets them. The HELICOPTERS arrive, and the falling building plunges right past them. The HELICOPTERS look across at each other, helpless. \nEXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT \nIt drops like a stone. \nEXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT \nSPIDEY and LIZ are falling away from the DOOR, sliding along the ROCK. LIZ is stopped by a RETAINING WALL. SPIDEY keeps sliding. He THWIPS the wall and then disappears over the edge. LIZ screams! \n", "test1_input": "PETER You don't get nicknamed Flash because you're a rocket scientist, Liz. \nLIZ Give it up, Parker. You'd die for a nickname like Flash. \nPETER Yeah, of embarrassment. \nKIM comes by and leans seductively by her LOCKER. KIM is a ripe one and hot-hot-hot! \nKIM (teasing) Hey, Flash... I'm scalping a pair of the Midnight Madness Wrestling Match tomorrow night. \nFLASH The Slammies??? I'd kill for that!!! \nKIM Would you pay $125? \nFLASH Well, uh, I... gee... if... can I tell you tomorrow? \nKIM (moving on) You snooze, you lose. Hiya Liz... \nLIZ Kim, you know Peter and Harry? This is my new roommate... Kim Nickson. \nKIM is pulling her pet, a foot long SALAMANDER, out of her LOCKER. She wraps it around her neck and turns to the boys. \nThey go bug-eyed! \nKIM (interested) Hellooo, Peter. \nPETER (embarrassed) Hi... \nLIZ We're going to the Student Reunion Meeting. You coming? \nPeter looks at KIM. Wow. Then he looks at LIZ who's adjusting herself in a small MIRROR. HARRY jabs him in the ribs. Yeah, yeah! \nPETER (frustrated) I can't... I gotta go over to the Daily Bugle. I'm trying to sell some photos. \nKIM Soooh, a photographer...? \nPETER Just an amateur. Well... nice meeting you, Kim. \nKIM Yeah... I bet it would be. \nHARRY Can I be your date for the reunion ShooShoo? \nKIM No Jerk! \nHARRY (she turns to go) What did I say... \nLIZ It's not what you said, it's how you say it, ShooShoo! \nEverybody leaves and Harry is left alone, he throws his bag down. \nHARRY Damn! \nPETER turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking WEINER. \nWEINER Peter, Doc Ock wants to see you. \nPETER About my data I bet. \nWEINER I don't know. \nPETER He knows about my work on the Planetary Conjunction, doesn't he? \nWEINER (lies) I don't know. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY \nPETER enters wide-eyed behind WEINER. This place is a far cry from the experiment in the LAB ROOM. It's a fantastic netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance. No one but PETER. \nOCK is sitting in a swivel CHAIR with his back to PETER. He has the look of Captain Nemo in his Nautilus. This is OCK'S domain. \nPETER Hello, Professor Octavius. (no response) I really admired your experiment. \nOCK (back to Peter) We have a lot of interests in common, Peter. Perhaps we should put our heads together, if you know what I mean... \nPETER (flattered) That would be... great. \nOCK (turns with a smile) Now you take the Planetary Conjunction. This Saturday night we will witness Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, the Earth, the Sun... all in a row. Never seen within the memory of man, or measured for its effect. The total gravitational force must be quite exceptional. Isn't that the subject of your paper...? \nPETER Yes sir, I've worked out a new way to calculate the combined gravitational effect. \nOCK I'm a busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think I could find the time to go over it with you. Make sure it all... checks out. \nPETER Well... I'm sort of working with Professor Rosomorf and he suggested we kind of keep it between us. He thinks that my theory is... well, I don't know... \nOCK (to himself) The scoundrel... (turns angry) I want to see that data, Peter! \nPETER But Professor Octavius... if I knew you were interested... sorry, I've already given it to... Professor Rosomorf, and he is after all the head of our Physics Department... and I couldn't... \nOCK turns sweet again. He smiles too broadly. \n", "test1_true": "PETER begins to leave. \nOCK Just a minute... how about if I show you my discoveries... something I never showed to any other student... as a matter of fact to anybody at all. \nPETER Well I am really flattered, I mean I'd love to... but I... \nOCK Very well shall we say if you come here tonight... \nPETER But Professor I don't now if I should... \nOCK Make it eight sharp... I'll be waiting for you... Right here... \nPeter looks worried then leaves. \nOCK turns to WEINER who slouches against the wall smiling. \nOCK The same academic world that's so keen to embrace that boy's undergraduate work, ridicules my anti-force theory as quackery. I ask you, Weiner... what is our society coming to? Ha! \nWEINER They are all a bunch of brainless assholes, that's what I say... \nOCK Weiner! Go get me that boy's data! \nWEINER Cost you fifty bucks. \nOCK (Weiner hissing) Just get it. We'll negotiate your fee when you have the data, alright Weiner? \nEXT. DAILY BUGLE - DAY \nEstablish as ART DECO BUILDING well beyond its prime. A sign says: \"The Daily Bugle.\" Peter enters the building. \nJAMESON (V.O.) Garbage! Absolute, 100% garbage! \nINT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY \nVery forties, very messy. J. Jameson scans some PHOTOS as PETER stands helplessly by. \nJAMESON Bag ladies. I hate bag ladies. \nPETER Yes, sir. \nJAMESON is 50ish, grey at the temples, brush cut on top. He too is forties. His chewed up CIGAR is forties. This guy is a hard case. \nJAMESON (looks at the other photos) Little kids... I hate little kids. This is a daily newspaper. We need news value photographs, not artsy-fartsy shit! \nPETER Yes, sir. \nJAMESON comes to a picture of a BUSINESS SUITED MAN with a MOHAWK. PETER smiles in anticipation. \nJAMESON Kid? You want a pro's assessment? \nPETER Yes, sir! \nJAMESON (handing photos back) Your photos suck. (cigar for emphasis) Parker, my readers are morons. I gotta grab them by the eyes. Every time you press the button of that Nikon of yours it costs you fifty-five cents. So the next time you're about to take the plunge, ask yourself, am I taking dog bites man? Because if you are... \nPETER I know, I know. You want man bites dog... \nJAMESON Parker, this is the post modern 20th century. I want man eats dog! Get out! \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nA seedy east village walk up. Peter takes his camera and takes various shots of a wino. ALL IN. He climbs the stairs to his building, looks through the mail, he collects from a beaten down mailbox. \nPETER (reading) Rent! Rent, more bills, rent... electricity, bills... \nINT. PETER'S APARTMENT - DAY \nA one-room, shabby roof apartment, a chaos of books and papers. A photo enlarger and darkroom baths in kitchen pots; 8x10s tacked to the walls; a spare camera and lenses. Self-consciously wacky kitsch; plastic dinosaurs, wind-up toys, a stuffed carp. An unmade bed and a 50's dinette set are the only furniture. A grimy skylight leads to the roof. It's not a pretty place, but it has personality. A voice from the kitchen, a shadow of an intruder, is sneaking around. \nPETER There's nothing in there worth stealing! \nMAY (V.O.) (from within the kitchen) That's the understatement of the year. \nPETER Aunt May, you're trespassing. \nMAY (comes in) I was just so desperately bored... I thought I'd come over and make you dinner... \nPETER I am old enough to... to make my own-- \nMAY But I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches. \nPETER I'll introduce you. \nMAY Oh. And those foul chemicals in the pots... \nPETER I take pictures, remember? \nMAY Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills... \n", "test1_id": 699, "test2_input": "AUNT MAY Oh, you did it in the bathroom? Peter, this is craziness, why don't you use your bed? You're up all night. You're in the radioactive labs. You never take time to eat or sleep. Am I right? \nPETER Yes, Aunt May. \nINT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT \nAUNT MAY (V.O.) Did you eat something today? \nPETER Yes, Aunt May. \nAUNT MAY (V.O.) Okay, Peter go back to bed, and remember we love you. \nPETER And I love you too, Aunt May. (hangs up) And by the way, I got a mess of super powers today. \nExit booth. He BANGS the PHONE BOOTH. Goes out and-- jumps lightly onto the phone booth roof. \nINT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT \nOCK is prepped for surgery. GOWNED PERSONNEL hurry about with a feverish urgency. The CHIEF SURGEON checks the SENSORS attached to OCK'S head. These seasoned professionals are astonished and frightened. \nCHIEF SURGEON (whispers) Look at these brainwave readings. The mental activity is ten times of any normal man...! \nBRAINMAN (whispers) Equipment malfunction...? \nCHIEF SURGEON (whispers) Hell, yeah... his. (checks Ock's chest) My God... I thought I'd seen everything... \nSURGEON #2 (whispers) But this is beyond medicine. This is madness...! \nOCK lays bare chested, face up, all FOUR WALDOS splayed. He is a true cyborg. Part man, part machine. Part organic, part molybdenum steel. \nNURSE (leaning in, blitzed) It is so freaky... \nCHIEF SURGEON (stern for the staff's sake) Okay, lets stop yakking and get cracking. I want to go in at the upper thoracic. Then we'll work our way around. (slaps Ock's shoulder) Hang in there, man. \nINSERT: The WALDO nearest the slap moves ever so slightly. The triangular CLAW rotates a quarter turn and then turns back. \nThe NURSE sees it and SCREAMS. \nCHIEF SURGEON (glares) Nurse! Number seven scalpel. Arthroscope stand by. Read out parameters in progress. Let's go in. You alright? \nNURSE Yes... Yes, of course. Everything's online. \nCHIEF SURGEON Scalpel! No... no... a larger one... the largest we have! \nShe slaps a HUGE ONE into his palm. He takes a deep breath and goes to work. MASKED heads gather round him. The SCALPEL is poised at the line where skin meets steel. We make an incision. The INSTRUMENTS go crazy. WARNING BELLS and BUZZERS sound. \nHEAD NURSE Kill the alarms! \nBRAINMAN He's going off the chart! \nA WALDO flashes around the steel leg of the operating TABLE and clanks tight! \nCHIEF SURGEON Mop. Mop! Sutures and clamps! Hurry up! \nSURGEON #2 We're losing him. Defibrillate! \nA HEART MACHINE is rushed in. They work frantically. \nCHIEF SURGEON Zap him! \nBRAINMAN Stabilizing alpha waves... \nSURGEON #2 applies the CARDIAC SHOCK PADS. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nNURSE You have a visitor, Doctor... \nShe leaves OCK and THORKEL alone. \nTHORKEL (enjoying this) Octavius, I'm afraid I have bad news for you. \nOCK The cyclotron is damaged... \nTHORKEL What used to be the cyclotron was permanently shut down this afternoon. \nOCK But my work! \nTHORKEL Your work is a disaster! Look at yourself! \nOCK Myself? I don't matter. Nobody matters anymore. To enter a new dimension we must first destroy our own... \nTHORKEL What are you saying? \nOCK gets off his bed throwing away his sheet waving with his 4 WALDOS and 2 arms. \nOCK Destroy life. Life is... insignificant. Bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh. What would you say? \nTHORKEL Oh, my God, what are those horrible things sticking from your body? \n", "test2_true": "THORKEL What on Earth are you rambling about? \nOCK Destiny!!! My destiny! I see it all so clearly now. Universal destruction, yes. All I need is the power... then I can destroy this illusion you call life. It is my destiny to lead us to the light! \nTHORKEL You're a madman. \nOCK And you are a fool. I will end the universe as you know it. And in that final moment... I'll laugh my ass off while you're kissing yours goodbye! \nTHORKEL (excited) Goodbye is right, Octavius... You're fired... sacked... canned. You are history, Doctor Octavius. And I couldn't be more pleased to be the first to tell you this good news... \nA WALDO shoots up and grabs THORKEL by the throat. He GASPS and SCREAMS silently as the telescoping WALDO lifts him off his feet. He rises until his head is just inches from the ceiling. \nTHORKEL (his last words) Let me down Ock... you crazy... MONSTER! Let me down! \nThen OCK smiles and slams THORKEL'S head through the ceiling. PLASTER rains down. THORKEL'S legs scissor and kick and then go limp. OCK throws his dead body on to the bed, and covers him with the WHITE SHEETS. \nOCK Okey, dokey. \nINT. TAXI - NIGHT \nThrough the WINDOW of the TAXI we see MADISON SQUARE GARDEN. \nAs it pulls up, a sign reads, \"Midnight Madness! MTV's Rock and Wrestling 'SLAMMY Awards!\" The TAXI come to a stop. \nPETER (looking up at the sign) MTV Wrestling?! \nREISS (getting out) That's the place. Pay the man. \nMAX REISS gets out, he is carrying a BOX. \nPETER Look, Mr. Reiss... I'm not real interested in watching a wrestling match. \nREISS Who said anything about watching a wrestling match? You're here to win a wrestling match! \nPETER Me? You must be kidding. \nREISS hustles PETER inside. \nREISS You hop around. You know, the way you did last night. Your opponent gets tired. He falls down. The ref counts to three, you win, and we pick up a thousand bucks. \nINT. CATACOMBS MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT \nWe can hear the CROWD screaming at something in the background as REISS leads PETER to an employee WASHROOM and shows him the BOX. \nREISS You're really gonna love this. \nPETER Look, really, I don't know... \nREISS You don't have to know. I know enough for both of us. (pause) Change in there. \nPETER What is this? \nREISS A costume... something that fits your talent. Go put it on. I'm sure you'll like it. \nHe slaps the BOX against PETER'S chest and all but pushes him inside. \nINT. WASHROOM - NIGHT \nPETER takes the suit out of the BOX. It is the SPIDER-MAN SUIT! He looks at it and shrugs. Then he begins to struggle into it. \nPETER is looking at himself in the MIRROR. He is dressed in all but the MASK. And he looks terrific! He flexes. He smoothes his hair. He's starting to get into it. \nINT. THE ARENA - NIGHT \nCRUSHER COLE is destroying an opponent. \nINT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT \nREISS winces as the CROWD CHEERS and BOOS. \nPETER (comes out) How does it look? I feel like it's Halloween. \nREISS Cover your face with the mask. \nPETER Why? \nREISS Mystery, my friend. Nobody should know who you are... \nINT. THE RING - NIGHT \nCRUSHER COLE is doing a big flexing number and the CROWD is going wild. There are MTV CAMERAS and SIGNS and BANNERS proclaiming the \"SLAMMIES\" everywhere. \nRING ANNOUNCER And now, a new challenger, for the thousand dollar fight, weighing in at one hundred and fifty pounds... from parts unknown! Here is the Amazing... Mysterious... Incredible Superman... \nREISS (snorts from ringside, hating the name) No, not Superman... Spider-Man... SPIDER-MAN!!! \nRING ANNOUNCER ...Spider-Man!!!!! \n", "test2_id": 700, "test3_input": "OCK (smiling) Okey, dokey. \nOCK goes about checking out the CYCLOTRON. It looks good. \nINT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT \nOCK starts flicking switches and reading DIALS, doing a \"mission countdown\" for his next experiment. This place has been \"hot rodded\" to the max. \nOCK (reading dials and numbers) Amperage, okay. Flux, 14. Negative variable differential... good enough. \nHe shuts it down. The WHINE whirs down. \nOCK Okey, dokey... now all I need is Parker's data. Where the hell is Weiner? Damn it... I can't trust anybody. (throws his Waldo in the air) Only you, my babies... only you can I trust... Okay... If I have to do everything myself... I'm going to do it. (to his equipment) I'll be back... my babies... my new babies! \nOCK hides the WALDOS under his coat and leaves the room. \nINT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThere is more EQUIPMENT than before. PETER is deep at work. His SPIDER-MAN UNIFORM hangs on the WALL. There is a knock at the DOOR. \nLIZ (V.O.) Hey, Peter! Are you finished with my computer yet? I got a paper too, you know... \nPETER (panicked) Oh my God... oh, it's you, Liz... I didn't expect you... uh... give me a minute. \nHe hides his SPIDER-MAN COSTUME. \nINT. THE HALLWAY LANDING - NIGHT \nLIZ waits impatiently. \nPETER (opening the door) Hi, Liz. Come on in. \nINT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nLIZ enters, looking around. PETER covers for this and that. \nLIZ What were you doing in here? \nPETER (looking around) Cleaning up. Come on. I'll get your computer. Where's Flash parked? \nHe picks up the COMPUTER and turns to her, but she's already looking around the apartment. \nLIZ Flash didn't come. \nPETER (holding it) Oh. Well... how are you going to get it home? \nLIZ walks into the room. \nLIZ Taxi... I guess. \nShe discovers the PRINTS of SPIDEY that PETER has taped up around the apartment. \nLIZ You must spend a lot of time with this Spider-Man guy... Peter! Don't you think you ought to unplug that! \nPETER looks and sees that he is tethered to the wall. Embarrassed, he puts the COMPUTER back down. \nPETER (embarrassed) I, uh, I'll go down to the corner... see it I can hail that taxi. \nPETER leaves. LIZ smiles. She likes PETER. Why is he so...? \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nA SHADOW of a MAN can be seen hiding. PETER does not notice him. \nINT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThere's a KNOCK at the DOOR. \nLIZ (crossing to it, wondering) Peter...? \nShe is about to open the door when FOUR WALDOS smash through it, obliterating it. OCK stands in the shattered doorway, WALDOS writhing. \nLIZ Doctor Octavius...! You're... You're... (finds the words) You're so weird!... with those... what do you call those... \nOCK Waldos... Did you hear about Spider-Man? (moving Waldos like spider's legs) That's me... the real Spider-Man... now tell me, where is that jerky friend of yours... Parker? \nLIZ (protecting) Peter?... oh... he's not here. He's gone. I don't think he'll be back for awhile. \nOCK (running his Waldo in her hair) You wouldn't lie to your Professor now, would you? \nLIZ Of course not. Why would I lie about a thing like that? Really. He's... out. \nOCK We'll wait. OCK grabs LIZ'S HAIR with his WALDOS. \nLIZ What are you doing... let me go! Please... take those things out of my hair! \nOCK My Waldos, you mean. \nLIZ Whatever you call them... please... \n", "test3_true": "OCK Sit. \nShe does. He does, too, and folds his WALDOS across his chest. \nOCK (chatty) He's a nice boy. A little nerdy maybe, but nice, wouldn't you say? \nLIZ Oh, I don't know. Maybe. He's very inexperienced. \nONE of OCK'S WALDOS rests on the TABLE curled around the COMPUTER. LIZ lets her hand rest on it. OCK warms immediately. \nOCK You know, you're a fascinating young lady... \nLIZ Thank you... \nOCK You're so refreshing. You're so... \nLIZ Shocking...? \nOCK (gone to far) Oh, I wouldn't say shocking... \nLIZ I would! \nShe sticks his WALDO in the ELECTRIC WALL SOCKET behind the COMPUTER! The CURRENT sizzles through him and he leaps up, WALDOS akimbo, like the \"cartoon cat.\" LIZ runs out the door. \nOCK extricates himself from the current and gives chase. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nLIZ burst from the DOOR. \nLIZ Peter...! \nShe looks both ways for PETER, doesn't see him, and takes off! OCK bursts from the doorway and runs off after LIZ. \nEXT. THE STREET - NIGHT \nLIZ running as fast as she can, but OCK is gaining quickly. \nEXT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA TAXI drives up and disgorges PETER. \nPETER Wait here... \nINT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHe walks in. It's empty \nPETER Liz? \nLIZ (V.O.) (screaming from the street) Peter! Help! Peter! \nPETER springs into action. He grabs his SPIDEY SUIT out of a drawer and starts taking off his clothes. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nLIZ looks back and sees OCK CARTWHEELING toward her. She can't outrun him. She must hide. There's a CONSTRUCTION SITE on the right. She ducks down the alley next to it. \nINT. CONSTRUCTION ALLEY - NIGHT \nLIZ runs into it and finds herself trapped on three sides by a high CYCLONE FENCE. Behind her, OCK'S WALDOS stretch out like waterbug legs. He bug-walks into the alley and laughs down at her from his perch atop the WALDOS. \nOCK Peter Parker has something I want... And I'm going to have something he wants. \nShe dashes past him and runs into the outboard CARGO ELEVATOR. \nINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nShe looks for the UP BUTTON and finds nothing! OCK, on his feet now, is on the wire mesh ELEVATOR CAGE in a flash. He tears the outer DOOR away. \nLIZ starts pressing KNOBS and LEVERS in panic. The LIGHT goes on. A WARNING BELL clangs. She finally finds the switch and the CAR leaps up just as OCK tears off its front door. \nLIZ, safe for the moment, watches OCK recede below, shaking the torn off door in a rage. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT \nExtending WALDO over WALDO, OCK climbs the ELEVATOR HOUSING chasing the rising CAR inside. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION ROOF - NIGHT \nThe CAR arrives and LIZ jumps out. She's on nothing but a narrow GIRDER! She tightropes on the GIRDER. OCK gets to the top. He looks across at her. She's stuck between two unfastened GIRDERS, at a dead end. He slowly telescopes a WALDO toward her. She's got no place to run, no place to hide. He grabs her by the BLOUSE and lifts her off the GIRDER. \nSPIDER-MAN (V.O.) Put her down, Ock. \nOCK looks across the street. There, on the top of a tall building, is SPIDER-MAN. \nSPIDER-MAN I know what's happening to you, Ock. I've been through a lot of changes myself lately. You have to listen to me. \n", "test3_id": 701}

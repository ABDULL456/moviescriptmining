{"train": "COBB \nWritten by RON SHELTON \nBased on material by AL STUMP \nJuly 1993 Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nDo not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Dylan Thomas \nNice guys finish last. Leo Durocher \n1   INT. OLD OFFICE (SANTA BARBARA, CA) - DAY (1960)          1 \nThe room is California Spanish, thick walls, arches, and light spills in from a mission window. But we don't have any sense of place just yet. At first there are just details. \nEXTREME CLOSEUP ON TYPEWRITER KEYS \nof an old Underwood upright, well-worn and ancient. A woman's fingertips with red nail polish are placed on the keys. They wiggle. \nCLOSE ON PIPE IN ASHTRAY Smoke curls.   A man's hand picks it up. \nCLOSE ON MAN'S HAT AND COAT on a coat rack. \nCLOSE ON WASTE BASKET Overflowing with crunched-up paper. \nMAN lies on a couch near the window. He stands up suddenly and looks out the window. AL STUMP, 40, is sharply dressed -- tie, dress shirt, cufflinks. He's staring at something. \nHIS POV - COURTYARD BELOW - BEAUTIFUL BRUNETTE \nin high heels crosses the courtyard. She glances up toward Stump, then quickly turns away and disappears. \nCLOSE ON STUMP \nHe sighs, and turns. STUMP The muse has   not descended, Lucille. (off   her silence) The muse has   not descended. (off   her silence) God damn it,   Lucille, you hear me? \n(CONTINUED) \n1   CONTINUED:                                                    1 ANGLE ON LUCILLE \nThe woman at the typewriter, a 50-year old steno/secre- tary, responds calmly. LUCILLE The muse has not descended. \nSTUMP Yes! The muse has left me stranded here like a beached whale -- only one phrase, one word, from finishing the greatest essay I've ever written! One word, the right word -- Flaubert called it 'le mot juste' -- I ever tell you that? Lucille is a longsuffering saint. LUCILLE 'Le mot juste' -- the exact right word the writer needs to tell his story. Yessir, you've mentioned it. STUMP Hemingway, Faulkner, Joyce -- they all searched for 'le mot juste' until they cried, until they bled... LUCILLE Yessir. STUMP What is this essay about again? \nLUCILLE Fishing. \nSTUMP I mean what is it really about? LUCILLE You said it was about the quote unquote primal issues of survival, man against nature, etcetera -- that's what you said. \nSTUMP Ohyeah... so... we end the essay with...

(hesitates) ... frozen in'... \nLucille types it out. LUCILLE Shimmering tarpon -- very good, Mr. Stump... (beat) ... 'frozen in' what? \nSTUMP (patiently) I don't know, Lucille, that's what the Muse will tell me if she ever descends. (considering) ... 'frozen in'... \nREYNALDO Stump!   For you. Stump goes to the phone, interrupting his own \"fight.\" STUMP (to Frank) Phone call saved your ass. Stump grabs the phone, covering an ear to hear better. STUMP (on phone) Yeah... yeah... who?... no... you're kidding?... when? Stump hangs up the phone and turns. His face registers shock, or more precisely, bewilderment and wonder. STUMP Hey... (as they ignore him) Shut up! \nThey do, and give Stump their ruffled attention. STUMP Cobb wants to see me. \nMUD Cobb who? STUMP Ty Cobb!    How many Cobbs are there?! This news instantly sobers the room. \n(CONTINUED) \n4   CONTINUED:    (4)                                                4 FRANK Ty Cobb?   I thought he was dead? \nSTUMP Not yet. He said he wants to tell me the real story of his life before he croaks. \nBILL You were just talking to Ty Cobb? \nSTUMP The Georgia Peach himself. This impresses the hell out of everyone in the room.           Even Stump is still a little dazed. \nFRANK They say Cobb is crazy. The meanest sonofabitch who ever lived. MUD I heard he killed a man. BILL Maybe so, but -- he was the greatest baseball player of them all. CRONIES Yeah, the best, no one close, etc... \nFrank suddenly is cautionary, concerned, paternal. FRANK Listen, Al, be careful -- STUMP I ain't gettin' my ass shot, don't worry... FRANK No, not that -- the story. (beat) This is like Ivan the Terrible inviting somebody into the Czar's palace before he died. \nSTUMP Except Ivan was a nicer guy... (CONTINUED) \n4   CONTINUED:    (5)                                            4 FRANK (concerned, earnest) Don't let Cobb bullshit you. This is your shot. This is all our shot. (as cronies agree) When does he want to see you? \nSTUMP Immediately. \nCUT TO: \n5   INT. NEARLY EMPTY MOVIE THEATER - DAY                        5 \nAl Stump sits alone in the theater, except for a teenaged boy sweeping the aisles, who stops to watch the screen. STUMP (V.O.) I gathered all the film footage that existed on Cobb -- which wasn't much -- and rented the local theater for the afternoon... (beat) I, too, had thought that the great Ty Cobb had been dead for awhile... \n6   ANGLE ON SCREEN                                              6 The screen fills with (B&W) Movietone Newsreel footage of Ty Cobb, complete with overly sincere NARRATION and MUSIC. \nNEWSREEL NARRATOR (V.O.) This 1905 cameo of an 18-year-old youth shows a peaches-and-cream complexion and the piercing eyes of a lad who would become, etc... Onscreen (B&W) -- Cobb as a young ballplayer followed by images of Cobb's famous batting stance, Cobb clowning, etc. STUMP (V.O.) His reputation as being difficult at best, psychotic at worst, preceded him. But if there was one thing I knew after all my years as a journalist covering politicians, celebrities, and sports heroes, it was this -- (CONTINUED) \n6   CONTINUED:                                                    6 Onscreen (B&W) -- Cobb with children, Cobb with celebri- ties, Cobb in a parade honoring him, and always, Cobb's dashing, swashbuckling style of play. STUMP (V.O.) The 'facts' -- and public perception of those 'facts' -- frequently bear little resemblance. Onscreen (B&W) -- Cobb in action -- His demon fury gives way to the fierce joy of his playing. He slashes a ball up the alley, turns first and never hesitates at second, and as the relay comes into third -- \nSTUMP (V.O.) One thing was beyond argument -- he was the most brilliant athlete of his time... perhaps of any time. (beat) I was determined to find out who was the real Ty Cobb. Cobb slides with spikes high and a cloud of dust. There is something thrilling and terrifying in the image. CUT TO: \n7   EXT. MOTHER LODE COUNTRY (CALIFORNIA) - LATE AFTERNOON        7 Stump's car, a late model Buick, moves across the stunning grasslands at the western base of the Sierra Nevadas. We begin hearing his voice, then see him inside the car driving. DISSOLVE TO: \n8   EXT. FOOTHILLS OF THE SIERRAS - DUSK                          8 \nStump's car heads up into the darkening mountains. STUMP (V.O.) They said Cobb owned property all over the country, but in recent years had been staying in his hunting lodge at Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevadas. \n9   AERIAL SHOT - LONE PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS                         9 \nmoving up into the Sierras, into rugged terrain and thick forests. \nCUT TO: \n10   INT. CAR - DUSK                                             10 Stump straining to see the road, a bit wary of this drive. \nSTUMP (V.O.) Driving into the Sierras at night with winter coming on wasn't the smartest decision I'd ever made but it seemed better than being late for my first meeting with Cobb. First drops of rain begin hitting the windshield -- Stump hits the wiper button and the floppy blades begin ineffectively wiping the windshield. Stump struggles with his vision. \nSTUMP Shit... \nPOV SHOT THROUGH WINDSHIELD A dismal, wet and obscured view of the mountain road, climbing higher into the Sierras. A small roadside gas station comes INTO VIEW, and -- Stump pulls his car into the station. CUT TO: \nSTUMP Mr. Cobb? The silence is shattered by a SCRATCH, then VIOLIN MUSIC from upstairs. STATIC suggests a record is playing. \n17   ANGLE ON STAIRS                                                17 Stump climbs the stairs with caution -- Until he's just outside the half open door from which light spills. He hesitates... STUMP Hello?   Mr. Cobb? A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- Ripping through the door.       Stump is terrified -- he gasps for air. STUMP Thank you very much, Mr. Cobb, but I don't need this job that bad. \nStump turns and creeps back toward the stairs, but -- ANOTHER GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- SHATTERING a hanging LAMP. \nStump freeses one more time.     Silence.   Then the voice -- COBB Yes, Mr. Stump -- you do need this job that bad. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n17   CONTINUED:                                                      17 COBB (CONT'D) (beat) Now come in here and meet the great Ty Cobb. (calmly) I won't hurt you. \nStump breathes deeply and steps into the doorway -- He does it as if there's no choice, accepting his fate. And sees: \n18   POV SHOT - TY COBB                                              18 Lying in bed in a robe. Unshaven. Bottles of booze and food everywhere. And bottles of pills sit on every surface. Two hunting dogs sit on the bed with him. A small record player sits next to he bed. A record spins, filling the room with FRITZ KREISLER VIOLIN SOLOS. He places the gun on      his night table, knocking pills and bottles to the floor      with a crash he barely notices. When he speaks it is      without a snarl, without threat -- simply, even sweetly,      he says: COBB On the violin -- Fritz Kreisler. I'm a great admirer of his. I'm also a great admirer of yours. \nBACK TO SCENE \nSTUMP Thank you. \nCOBB But you are a hopeless romantic and only a moderate success. \nSTUMP Sir, I am the most successful sportswriter in America and not merely a 'moderate success.' \nCOBB Of course. (beat) Give me those pills over there. \n(CONTINUED) \n18   CONTINUED:                                                     18 Stump retrieves some pills that Cobb is pointing towards. Cobb washes down a handful of pills with a bottle of Scotch. Momentarily revitalized, Cobb hands Stump a folded letter which Stump opens to read. COBB That's an invitation to a testimonial dinner at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. You're taking me there -- when is it? \nSTUMP (looking at the letter) A few weeks. \nCOBB All the great ones will be there -- The great Mickey Cochrane will be there! Hornsby, Sisler, Ott, the Waner Brothers... we used to have some parties, Stump, I'll tell ya that right now... (beat) We can't forget. STUMP I won't forget. \nCOBB Look at me closely, Al... (with utmost sincerity) Lie after lie has been written about me -- my whole life I've been misunderstood. (beat) You're gonna tell the real story of Ty Cobb. STUMP What's the 'real' story? Cobb climbs slowly out of bed.     His words are reasoned and not without passion. \nCOBB That's why you're here. (beat) See, there's two kinds of writers. The kind that spin endless yarns about small subjects... that's you. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n18   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 18 COBB (CONT'D) (beat) Or... there's the kind with one great subject that consumes them forever. (beat) That could be you. Because I am that subject. Cobb hobbles to a table in front of a window. The table is covered with pills, bottles, needles, and booze. COBB (suddenly bellowing) Jameson! Get your ass up here! \nCobb grabs another bottle of booze and swigs deeply, liquor spilling over him. Then, suddenly, he holds up his hand. A calm comes over him as -- He stares out the window into the snowy woods.       His rage has quickly turned into a quiet, intense, unsettling focus. STUMP You okay? COBB Mmmmmm... \n19   POV SHOT - WOODS IN MOONLIGHT                                     19 \nnear the lodge. A bank of snow -- and a large buck moves INTO VIEW. \n20   CLOSE ON COBB'S FACE                                              20 His eyes light.     A flare in his nostrils.    A twitch.     And utter calm. \nBACK TO SCENE \nJameson, the man in the suit, arrives and stands in the back of the room. He takes notes when Cobb speaks. JAMESON (MAN) Sir? \nCobb continues staring out the window at the buck. (CONTINUED) \n20   CONTINUED:                                                         20 COBB There's a small oil company near Bakersfield called Honolulu Oil, sitting near the Elk Hills Reserve... (beat) I want you to buy all the stock you can. JAMESON Honolulu Oil? \nCOBB Getty is expanding in the west, looking for companies like that. I got a hunch... (beat) Stumpy, c'mere... Cobb picks up the revolver and holds it lovingly. Stump crosses and stands behind Cobb, sharing the view. COBB I can take that buck.     What'ya think? STUMP With a pistol? No way. Cobb smiles and loads the revolver.       He pushes the window which swings slowly open. \n21   POV SHOT - BUCK IN MOONLIGHT                                       21 searches for leaves to eat in the snow.          Serene.   Unaware. \nBACK TO SCENE \nSTUMP You're not treating me like a writer -- you're treating me like a stenographer. \nBLAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT -- Stump types quickly, hunting and pecking with two fingers, reading aloud. \nSTUMP Know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day... COBB It has a certain ring to it... STUMP Yes it does. COBB I thought you might like it. It's yours, a gift from me. (beat) 'Cobb, a prince among men, misunderstood in his genius, as genius always is' - (demands from Stump) This is the second line from what will be the greatest biography of a great man ever written -- type it! Cobb checks the tape and suddenly is deep in thought over some information coming across. Stump types. \nCOBB Bethlehem Steel's about to dive. \nCobb grabs a phone and dials -- Then barks into the phone. COBB (on phone) Jameson. Bethlehem's going in the toilet. Dump it all! Cobb slams down the phone, momentarily lost in finance. \n(CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                26 STUMP You got a stock tip for me? \nCOBB Yeah... buy Coca-Cola. We're about to go out in cans. \nSTUMP Coke in cans?    I don't think so. Cobb just stares back in disdain.      Then, suddenly -- \nCobb starts coughing terribly. He clutches his torso as if it were about to fall into pieces. \nCOBB You know what's wrong with Ty Cobb? STUMP What? COBB (proudly) Every disease known to man -- I got 'em all! And they'll never get me in a hospital -- never! (beat) My heart leaks -- the doctors who are nothin' but a buncha hacksaw artists give me Digoxin to keep it pumping... Cobb grabs a bottle of Digoxin pills and flings it across the room in a rage. He flings bottles of pills as he recites his ailments. \nCOBB They give me Darvon for the cancer in my back, they give me Tace for something eatin' up my stomach, Fleets Compound for an infection in my bowels, Librium for my tension, insulin for my diabetes... \nCobb grabs a hypodermic needle and awkwardly pours from a bottle into the chamber. Insulin spills as he does. COBB Fuckin' insulin... \nHe jams the needle wildly into his arm without hesitation. (CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED:    (4)                                              26 He takes a deep breath as if the drug has produced an immediate relief from pain. \nCOBB And if all that wasn't enough, it's been two years since I got my pecker in the air... (beat) The South may not rise again but my dick will. \nThe PHONE RINGS. COBB (barks) I ain't here! \nStump answers the phone. STUMP (answering the phone) Cobb's residence... hello. (beat) He's not here -- who's calling? Ernie? Ernie who? (his face drops) My God... (to Cobb) It's Ernest Hemingway... for you. COBB Tell him to go to hell! Stump covers the receiver nervously. STUMP Jesus  Christ, Ty, this is the great  American writer -- this is the  man who inspired me to become  a writer! \nCOBB Tell him to go to hell anyway. STUMP Why? \nCOBB Him and me used to be pals but we went on a hunting trip once and he hired a shitty guide. \n(CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED:    (5)                                              26 STUMP That's it? You didn't like a guide he hired? Cobb looks at Stump with a fierceness that is so over- whelming, so physical, that Stump melts. \nCOBB You tell him to go fuck himself or I'll kick your Yankee ass! \nStump is terrified.    He reluctantly uncovers the receiver. STUMP Mr. Hemingway? Mr. Cobb says... to go to hell. (awkwardly) By the way I'm a big fan of yours -- CLICK, a hang up. Cobb settles into a chair, letting the drugs and pills and booze work their way into his thick body. COBB Hemingway isn't a bullfighter -- he wrote about bullfighting. What the hell is that?! (beat) Bullshit... Damn painkillers... Cobb rubs his head -- The drugs are taking effect. STUMP Ty, you okay? \nCOBB It'll pass... (increasingly woozy) Stumpy, listen to me -- you know what I need? \nSTUMP What do you need? COBB I need a woman. (muttering to sleep) A woman is definitely what I need... \n(CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED:    (6)                                            26 And Cobb drifts to sleep in his chair, momentarily overcome with painkillers. \nStump stares at the sleeping volcano of a man, and when Cobb starts snoring heavily, he rises, pulls on a coat, scarf, and hat, and heads out the door. \nCUT TO: \nYoung Cobb surfaces in the river and waves his arms in triumph. His pals shriek with delight and embrace him at his courage. \nCOBB (V.O.) ... it was the greatest thrill in my life not counting the first time I saw a woman naked... \n50   SERIES OF SHOTS (B&W)                                         50 \nOther trains on other tracks bearing down on young Cobb. In each case -- Young Cobb dances in the track and leaps with grace to safety. \n(CONTINUED) \n50   CONTINUED:                                                     50 COBB (V.O.) I felt protected. By my father, my mother, the baptism, I don't know -- but from that moment on I knew I couldn't be hurt. \nSERIES OF SHOTS Young Cobb hurtles through the air toward the river, just missing the locomotive... \nCUT TO: \n51   INT. CAR IN BLIZZARD - DUSK                                    51 \nCobb and Stump continue racing down the mountainside. COBB My father died in a terrible accident, you know. STUMP No, I didn't, really... COBB Didn't you do your research on me before you came up here? STUMP I didn't have time... I mean, I knew the basics. \nCOBB Then you've read that I'm the meanest bastard of them all? \nSTUMP People have said that, yes... \nCOBB I don't care what people think. STUMP Then why do you care what I write? \nCOBB I am who I tell you I am!   Why are you making things so complicated?! \nSTUMP That's what writers do. \n(CONTINUED) \n51   CONTINUED:                                                     51 COBB Well writers oughta make things simple! Everything's complicated enough as it is. STUMP (mutters) Maybe you're right! COBB Of course I'm right! \nStump suddenly looks up and shouts in terror. STUMP Ty! \nA snow-covered truck in the middle of the road, broken down and abandoned, is on top of us. STUMP Godddddddd! Cobb spins the wheel -- The car spins out of control, just missing the truck, and hurtling on down the icy highway. COBB Don't shout like that, Stumpy -- it just increases my tension. I saw that truck all along -- you think I'm gonna hit a truck when I'm getting close to finding me some women? Stump is in sheer terror by this time. \nCOBB My father was murdered, y'know. STUMP Your father was murdered? COBB I mean that's the sort of thing you're looking for, isn't it? (beat) Murdered on the balcony of his own house... the house I grew up in... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n52   EXT. GABLED HOUSE IN GEORGIA - NIGHT (B&W)                   52 The head of a horse in f.g., shaking its head, uncomfort- able with the bit in its mouth. In the b.g., the gabled house in the moonlight. A small light spills from a second- floor window onto the balcony. A man on the balcony porch moves toward the window from which light spills. \nThe man pulls up the window and -- KABLAM! A SHOTGUN BLAST rips the silence and darkness. The man falls on his back. KABLAM!   A second SHOTGUN BLAST takes off his head. \nCUT TO: \n53   INT. CAR ON HIGHWAY - DUSK                                   53 Stump is stunned by this information as the car careens wildly down the mountainside. STUMP Your father was murdered? How come nobody knows about this? COBB The oldtimers in Royston know about it. Nobody else's business. It happened when I was 17, a few days before Detroit called me up. STUMP But this helps explain why -- He catches himself. \nCOBB Why I'm such a prick? Ha! (laughs) That's too easy -- you're a better writer than that -- STUMP Was the killer ever caught? \nCOBB There was an arrest, a trial, and an acquittal. Nobody was ever convicted. \nSTUMP Jesus Christ -- \n(CONTINUED) \n53   CONTINUED:                                                       53 COBB Aw, don't go sob-sister on me, Stumpy. (beat) The only thing that finally matters is a man's accomplishments and I must say, in all humility, Al, in all humility -- I was the greatest ballplayer of all time. Nobody is even a close second. \nBACK IN DUGOUT More money is wagered. \nPITCHER Stretches and delivers -- Cobb takes off for third.       The throw is high -- he slides in safely. \nIN STANDS \nBets are doubled. The stands are full of wagering. The whole ballpark is like a giant saloon -- drinking, smoking, wagering -- and the game is played by thugs and brigands. \nCOBB ON THIRD \nYells at the pitcher and Catcher. \n(CONTINUED) \n55   CONTINUED:    (4)                                             55 COBB You want in on the action? My mother has a better arm than you! (to the Catcher) I'm coming to you, greaseball! Coming to kick your dago ass! \nCATCHER steals a glance at Cobb who takes a menacing lead off third. The Catcher gives a signal to the pitcher. \nPITCHER \nnods, winds up, and as he does -- Here comes Cobb with a recklessness beyond reason. And as the pitch arrives in the Catcher's hands, the Catcher digs in to take on Cobb -- Cobb slides spikes high, flying above the earth, his back leg slashing his spikes like knives. It is a slide of utter defiance and violence, a slide intended to harm. A vicious collision between Cobb and the catcher -- blood and dust. The ball rolls free. Safe. \nCobb and the catcher immediately start punching and in seconds, a brawl breaks out, both benches clearing. As the police rush out to break up the brawl... COBB (V.O.) In those days you didn't hold hands and dance with the men on the other teams. They were the enemy -- you fought with 'em. (beat) And I was the most hated man in baseball. \n56   EXT. PHILADELPHIA BALLPARK - DAY (B&W)                        56 \nCobb enters the stadium through the dugout. The crowd rises to boo Cobb. The boos are overpowering. Cobb warms up in front of the dugout. The boos are deafening. The vindictive threats are ceaseless. \nFAN #1 You're a shit, Cobb! (CONTINUED) \n56   CONTINUED:                                                     56 Cobb continues warming up. \nFAN #2 I hate your guts, Cobb! Cobb tips his hat and speaks easily to the fan. \nCOBB A good day to you, too, sir... The police escort Cobb to right field -- the roar of the vitriolic crowd increases. COBB (V.O.) Do you know what it's like to be booed like that? \nCobb in right with the cops -- the crowd on its feet, booing so loudly that the air is all one giant, wailing moan of hatred. COBB (V.O.) It feels wonderful! They couldn't live without me! They came to the ballpark to see me! \n57   INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (B&W)                                  57 \nCobb opens a stack of mail -- a police chief and subor- dinate officers are with him. \nCLOSE ON MAIL Cut-out letters read:    \"COBB - YOU'RE DEAD\" \nCobb puffs on a cigar defiantly as he reads his hate mail. COBB (V.O.) Fifty thousand fans trying to kill me everywhere I went! \n58   EXT. PHILADELPHIA BALLPARK - DAY       (B&W)                   58 \nArmed police patrol the stands looking for snipers as Cobb plays the game in right field surrounded by police. \nThe booing increases -- fans truly hate him. \n(CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:                                                     58 CLOSE ON COBB \nHe smiles. COBB (V.O.) I loved it. Only great men are booed. Captains of industry and presidents. I knew 'em all... \n59   EXT. WHITE HOUSE (C. 1920)    (B&W)                            59 \nThe woman turns to confront the two men.     Now we see her. On a fabulous platinum-blonde wig is stuck    a yellow slicker-type rain hat. The ear flaps are     awry, the platinum-blonde wig curls up around it --    the effect is thrilling. \n(CONTINUED) \n73   CONTINUED:                                                    73 WOMAN IN WIG Stand back, you old farts. I'm in the middle of something -- (back to clerk) The heat's on the blink and the mattress is lumpy -- I want a discount. \nCLERK Aw, c'mon, you always want a discount, Mona. \nRAMONA (WOMAN) Ra-mona... and the mattress is always lumpy -- \nCobb pulls out a bottle of pills and washes a handful down with a deep swig from a pint bottle of whiskey. The Clerk looks on with alarm. STUMP Excuse me, I've gotta get him checked in. He's very sick. \nRAMONA We're all sick in the eyes of God -- but some of us still have manners. \nShe whirls and leaves the lobby, leaving the three men. STUMP Two rooms, next to each other. \nCUT TO; \n74   INT. COBB'S ROOM - NIGHT                                      74 Stump helps Cobb shoot up with insulin -- The needle clumsily groping for a vein in the old man's arm. \nCLOSE ON COBB \nHis face looks terrible, drawn, drained. \nCobb reaches into his pouch and pulls out a bundle of cash and security notes, tied neatly with a string. \nCOBB (barely audible) My money... (CONTINUED) \n74   CONTINUED:                                                   74 STUMP Your money's okay, Ty, right here... COBB My gun... \nSTUMP Your gun's okay, too... right here... \nAnd Stump hands Cobb his beloved pistol, which Cobb takes with great affection and comfort. Stump helps Cobb into bed, covering him with a blanket. The gun and the money sit on the pillow next to his head. Cobb speaks with great pain just before he passes out from pain, drugs, and exhaustion. COBB We haven't missed the testimonial dinner, have we? STUMP No we haven't missed the dinner... COBB Good, good... Cobb manages a small, pained smile before drifting off into sleep. Stump turns off the light and exits. \nCUT TO: \n75   INT. STUMP'S ROOM NEXT DOOR - NIGHT                          75 Stump pours a glass of vodka, settles into a chair, and dials the phone. He swallows deeply of the drink, and waits. STUMP (on phone) Hello? Happy Birthday! It's your Daddy! Yeah! (beat) Your birthday was yesterday?! No, it couldn't be! \nStump quickly checks a calendar on the wall and realizes he's missed his son's birthday. (CONTINUED) \n75   CONTINUED:                                                   75 STUMP (on phone) Omigod, what can I say? I feel terrible -- no, it's not okay, jeez... When I get off the road we'll do something special -- a late birthday, eh? Maybe you can go to spring training or something with me, eh? Yeah... (beat) Listen, is your mother there? (beat) I know she doesn't want to speak to me, but I want to speak to her. (waits for answer) Okay, okay -- I feel terrible about the birthday... I'll call you real soon. And tell your mother I'm not drinking anymore. Okay... 'bye, 'bye... Stump hangs up the phone -- Takes a deep breath, and... He pours another drink, and sits down to his typewriter. STUMP Fuck it... Stump is hunkered over his typewriter pounding away.       His VOICE OVER indicates what he is writing. STUMP (V.O.) I was a fool for thinking Cobb's brilliance might be what I needed at this moment of my life... Ty Cobb was the last thing I needed. (beat) He was not misunderstood -- he was understood perfectly well. He hated blacks, he hated Jews, he hated Catholics -- he hated everything except himself and his own view of the world... (beat) At times it seemed like he would drop dead in front of me... (beat) ... and other times he seemed indestructible... (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n75   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              75 STUMP (V.O.) (CONT'D) (beat) I was reluctant to view the great Ty Cobb as a pathetic character, lost in the past, paranoia, and the shallow defense of 'his own breeding'... \nWe hear SOUNDS of the TYPEWRITER BANGING away as... We DRIFT OUT the window -- Leaving Stump to write all night, at first viewing through the window, then moving until we have a view of -- \n76   EXT. VIEW OF RENO - NIGHT                                      76 \nWe hear the incessant BANGING OF the TYPEWRITER GRADUALLY FADE AWAY... DISSOLVE TO: \n77   INT. STUMP'S ROOM AT HOTEL - DAY                               77 Stump asleep -- full sun shines in the window.       Noon. A BOTTLE CRASHES against the headboard jarring Stump to consciousness. He looks up to see: Cobb reading the pages in a rage.     He tears them as he does. COBB 'Pathetic, paranoid, lost in the past!' What is this shit?! \nStump awakens slowly, disoriented, amidst a shattered bottle. STUMP Those are my notes!   You can't look at my notes! COBB You're notes -- my life! You're gonna betray me, you son of a bitch! STUMP You want the truth?   I'm gonna tell the truth! (CONTINUED) \n77   CONTINUED:                                                   77 COBB Whose truth? \nSTUMP Mine, for crissakes, I'm the writer! \nCOBB But I'm the legend and legends are not pathetic! \nSTUMP Hello? Charlie? Al... I'm in Reno... yeah... things are fine... (beat) Yeah, listen... I'm just checking... did we give away final editorial approval on this Cobb book? (long beat of disbelief) We did? Cobb has it? Jesus... Stump listens long and hard -- his face sinks. Cobb smiles and hangs the phone back up for Stump who reaches for the bottle on the nightstand and pours himself a morning drink of vodka. \nCOBB Well, you were pretty stupid to give up approval, weren't ya? STUMP Fuck you, Cobb? COBB Fuck me? Why me? (suddenly charming) Why you mad at me? Your agent made the deal, your lawyer, your publisher, you didn't even read the contract because you trusted them! Who the hell ever trusted a lawyer or an agent?! If I was Al Stump, the guy I'd be pissed off at would be Al Stump! STUMP Listen to me, you son of a bitch -- if you die before the book is finished, I'll write the story I want. COBB But I ain't dying first. \nSTUMP I'll write slow. \n(CONTINUED) \n83   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             83 COBB I'll die slow. \nCobb lights a big cigar -- and sets fire to Stump's pages. Both men watch them go up in smoke. \nCOBB Now get dressed so we can go find some women... Stump just stares back -- exhausted and overmatched. \nCUT TO: \n84   INT. HARRAH'S CLUB (RENO) - NIGHT                             84 \nThe main room -- Showtime.     In progress. LOUIS PRIMA WITH KEELY SMITH are thrilling a packed house full of dinner tables. LOUIS PRIMA AND GROUP 'That old black magic has me in its spell, That old black magic that you weave so well..' Cobb and Stump at a table drinking and eating. A cigarette girl works the room at a nearby table.      She's all legs and fishnet stockings... and wig. COBB Look't that -- hundred bucks says I get in her pants before dawn. \nThe cigarette girl turns and we recognize her. STUMP My God -- it's Mona... Ra-mona... We met her at the hotel... Ramona is a vision in this outfit as she approaches them. \nCOBB I don't remember... Ramona arrives at their table. \nRAMONA Cigarettes, gentlemen? Cigars? We stockpiled some Havanas before Senor Castro did his little number. \n(CONTINUED) \n84   CONTINUED:                                                     84 STUMP Coupla Monte Cristos, Ramona, number twos. RAMONA Have we met? \nSTUMP At the hotel -- checking in. RAMONA Ohyeah, you were the asshole. Cobb is suddenly gallant, gentlemanly, even charming. \nCOBB Excuse me, young lady, I must apologize for the behavior of my friend -- he has a crude side. Ramona delivers the cigars and collects the money. Stump is a bit chagrined and caught off guard by this Cobb. \nRAMONA I accept. COBB Ramona... Spanish name... lovely... it means 'moonlit garden of the gods'... RAMONA Actually it's German and means 'wise protectoress' but thanks for the thought... \nINTERCUT WITH: \nONSTAGE \nLouis Prima takes the mike -- His number has finished to much applause from the drunken crowd. \nLOUIS PRIMA Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, you're a great crowd ... I have been informed that we have a celebrity with us tonight who is a legend, a man who truly needs no introduction... (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n84   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            84 LOUIS PRIMA (CONT'D) (beat) ... so let's give a Harrah's Casino warm welcome to the greatest baseball player of all time, the one and only Ty Cobb! \nThe spotlight flies to Cobb who kisses Ramona's hand. Stump has been left out of the exchange, and mumbles. STUMP 'Moonlit garden of the gods'? The audience stands to applaud Cobb -- Full and genuine. Cobb graciously waves to the crowd, bowing, basking. \nBACK ONSTAGE - LOUIS PRIMA motions to his band. LOUIS PRIMA And this one's for the Georgia Peach! They break into \"Sweet Georgia Brown.\" LOUIS PRIMA/KEELY SMITH No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown, Two left feet but oh so sweet is Sweet Georgia Brown... Cobb breaks into a little dance with Ramona at the table, much to Stump's (and Ramona's) amazement. For a moment, at least, there is great footwork and lightness in his movement -- we get a glimpse of the great athlete he once was. LOUIS PRIMA The great Ty Cobb! C'mon up here! STUMP They want you, Ty -- \nCOBB Of course they want me. And Cobb heads for the stage, walking better but not without effort, a walk enhanced by drugs and booze. As he does, Ramona turns to Stump. (CONTINUED) \n84   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              84 RAMONA Who's that? \nSTUMP The greatest baseball player of all time. \nRAMONA I don't know baseball from shmaseball but I know a nice man when I see one and I also know it's time for my coffee break. Hasta luego. And she's off with her trayful of tobacco to the cocktail lounge. \nBACK ONSTAGE As Cobb arrives... LOUIS PRIMA AND GROUP (singing) Fellas, she can't get, are fellas, she ain't met, Georgia made her, Georgia claimed her, Sweet Georgia Brown. \nSTUMP No, I do. \nRAMONA All this ambiguity -- I see why she's divorcing ya. Stump, completely befuddled, lets down completely. He doesn't care about getting laid or drunk or anything for the moment, except having someone to talk to -- the some- one is Ramona. \nSTUMP I don't know what I'm saying or doing anymore... I'm trying to speak my heart. RAMONA Oh God... STUMP I told my wife I wanted a divorce. She said 'okay' -- then I realized maybe I don't. RAMONA Then go back to her. STUMP No. \nRAMONA Then quit crying. You want a divorce, you don't want a divorce, you're asking marital advice from a woman you're trying to get in the sack -- Jeez Louise! \nSTUMP I'm not myself. \nRAMONA Who is? A sigh.   Stump is lost.    He motions to the bartender. \n(CONTINUED) \n85   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              85 STUMP Another round, Harvey. (back to Ramona) This assignment has me befuddled. I'm supposed to tell the world that a monster is really a prince. I'm supposed to lie. \nRAMONA You being paid? \nSTUMP Very well. RAMONA Then it's not a lie. It's a job. Quit agonizing -- take the money, do what you gotta do, and get it over with. STUMP I can't. RAMONA Then quit. STUMP No! \nRAMONA For godsakes why not? Stump has to think about this for a while. \nSTUMP He knows greatness. I'm in the presence of greatness. I want to learn about greatness. She looks at him like he's crazy. \nRAMONA Greatness is overrated. STUMP Maybe you're right, maybe you're right... RAMONA So what do you want? \nStump drinks deeply -- his heart needs alcoholic reinforcement. (CONTINUED) \n85   CONTINUED:    (4)                                               85 STUMP I want to be in someone's arms tonight. RAMONA Oh that. Why do men have such a hard time saying what they want? \nCUT TO: \n86   INT. STUMP'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                 86 Stump and Ramona stagger in drunkenly -- they are awkward and passionate. \nShe grabs his vodka and takes a swig from the bottle. STUMP Wait, wait... don't drink too much. RAMONA Ya think I won't be able to screw if I'm too drunk? STUMP Well... yeah... \nRAMONA Screwed, stewed, and tattooed! She laughs a hearty laugh, letting it all out. \nSTUMP C'mere... I want to hold you. \nRAMONA You're so thoughtful -- the others are trying to get me drunk and you're trying to keep me sober.  You'd be good husband material. STUMP Not so fast -- \nRAMONA I didn't mean -- \nSTUMP Come here. (CONTINUED) \n86   CONTINUED:                                                   86 They embrace -- and hold each other fully, doing nothing but holding on. Stump relaxes. \nRAMONA I'm not a whore. \nSTUMP Shh, shh... I know, I know... A moment of quiet, simple bliss -- when: \nThe door bursts open -- the LOCK SPLINTERS with a CRASH, and: Cobb bursts into the room -- Full of rage. \nCOBB You two-timing bastard! You God damn Judas Iscariot! You stealing my girl! I'll kill you! STUMP She's not 'your' girl! And Cobb lashes out at Stump -- Stump tries to block the blow, but Cobb is relentless, and Cobb hits him again. \nStump falls backwards -- His head hits a corner of the table. RAMONA What're you doing?! And Cobb backhands Ramona across the face, knocking her down. \nStump lies on the floor only half conscious. He grabs his head. Blood. The room swirls in front of him as -- \nTHROUGH the open door -- Stump rises to his feet, feels his head, and groggily staggers out. Blood on his hand. \nStump feels his way past a couple doors, listening in, unsure which room is Cobb's until a booming voice -- COBB (O.S.) Ramona! Stump hurries to Cobb's door and listens in to be sure. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n89   INT. COBB'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       89 \nCobb stands above her with his gun and his money. \nCOBB Exactly what I say... \n(CONTINUED) \n89   CONTINUED:                                                       89 Cobb pulls a stack of bills from his bag. \nCOBB A thousand dollars... He holds out the money for her. \nRAMONA Do what you gotta do and get it over with, Mr. Cobb. \nSilence. Cobb takes a big, sloppy hit from a bottle, throwing in a few pills for good measure. COBB I want you to tell everyone you meet that you fucked me and I was the best fuck you ever had. RAMONA That's all? COBB That's a lot. RAMONA For a thousand bucks?    Hell yes. He reaches out and straightens her wig which is pretty crooked by now. She lets him. Then he falls apart, vio- lently grabbing his crotch. COBB I'm looking at the most beautiful woman in the world, do you hear me?! \nCobb grabs his crotch with the violence he does everything. COBB And I'm dead down here! Dead! Nothing! And it's been like that for over two years! Nothing! Now get outta here before I hit you! \nCobb lashes out at Ramona -- a vicious right hand.         She ducks as his fist slams through the headboard. RAMONA Georgia Peach my ass -- Georgia trash is what you are! (CONTINUED) \n89   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               89 Ramona grabs her clothes and runs from the room, past Stump who has heard it all. He enters Cobb's room. \nCobb sits at the foot of the bed, thoroughly flustered. Stump helps him into his bed where he curls up with his money and his gun, barely conscious. \nCOBB She was a great piece of ass, Stumpy, best I ever had... \nSTUMP Good, good... COBB Have we missed the Testimonial Dinner? STUMP No we haven't, Ty... now get some sleep... Stump tucks Cobb in his bed as the old man drifts into sleep, turns off the light, and heads back to his own room. \nCLOSE ON COBB asleep. Even in sleep, dying, he is twitching and full of fragments of unspent energy. STUMP (V.O.) He slept for days. I thought he was gone for sure. But even in sleep he was restless and in motion, a fire always burning in his belly... \nCUT TO: \n90   INT. HOTEL - STUMP'S ROOM - DAY                                 90 Stump at the typewriter, pounding away without interruption. \nSTUMP (V.O.) By this time I was working on two manuscripts -- one was his version, My Life In Baseball -- which for better or worse was a history of how to steal second base or how to hit the breaking ball to the opposite field. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n90   CONTINUED:                                                  90 STUMP (V.O.)

COBB'S ROOM - DAY                                      91 \nCobb tossing and turning in his sleep, squeezing a pillow or blanket in a death grip. STUMP (V.O.) ... It contained nothing about his children and ex-wives, none of whom would even speak to him... (beat) It contained no insights from his friends because I couldn't find any. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n92   INT. STUMP'S ROOM - CLOSE ON TYPEWRITER - NIGHT             92 \nPages of the baseball book in progress next to a neatly- stacked manuscript in progress. STUMP (V.O.) It was a baseball book and I kept it in the typewriter for him to discover and amend... (beat) It was a book I never planned to publish. Stump sits on his bed smoking his pipe and writing in longhand on pieces of paper of all sizes. STUMP (V.O.) The second version, my version, was written on legal pads and hotel stationery and cocktail napkins and anything I could scrape together without drawing his attention... (beat) I kept my version in a box at the bottom of my suitcase -- (CONTINUED) \n92   CONTINUED:                                                       92 Stump packs \"his\" version into a box, hiding it deep in his suitcase. \nSTUMP (V.O.) The whole thing had become an agonizing death watch, and most days I couldn't believe the son of a bitch wouldn't die... The door flies open and Cobb bursts in -- full of vim and vigor, a fresh set of clothes on, fire in his eyes. \nCobb is in an upbeat mood. He's reading a map.       A tape recorder with hand mike sits between them. \n(CONTINUED) \n96   CONTINUED:                                                     96 COBB Y'know something, Alimony, I believe you're the best friend I ever had. STUMP You're kidding. \nCOBB Swear on a Bible, Stumpy -- I feel I can trust you now. \nCLOSE ON STUMP \ndeeply alarmed by this confession. \nSTUMP (V.O.) I was disturbed, to say the least, that he felt we were friends -- but at least for the moment it made things bearable. (beat) And he started talking -- the world according to Ty Cobb... Cobb talks into a tape recorder sitting on his lap, enjoying the hand microphone. \nCOBB (into recorder) And then this fat ass named Babe Ruth came into the league and damn near destroyed the game of baseball... We all thought he was gonna eat and fuck his way outta the league but he hung around for a few years -- STUMP 'Hung around'? He was -- (quickly revising) -- next to you -- the greatest player of all time. He hit 714 home runs?! \nCOBB Anybody can hit home runs. Now excuse me, I got work to do... \nSTUMP Sorry, Ty -- And Cobb resumes into the tape recorder. \n(CONTINUED) \n96    CONTINUED:    (2)                                            96 COBB I didn't care that they cheered and adored Ruth -- I cared that they respected his ballplaying -- Christ, they built Yankee Stadium for him with a 297-foot right field line. My sister Florence could hit the ball 297 feet! DISSOLVE TO: \n97    EXT. STADIUM - DAY (1920S) (B&W)                             97 Game in progress -- Detroit vs. New York. \nCobb at the plate -- a pitch at his head knocks him down. Immediately, both benches clear in a major brawl. COBB (V.O.) Whenever we got into a fight with the New Yorkers, 24 of our guys would fight 24 of their guys and me and Ruth would take on each other! As the benches clear -- Cobb races not at the pitcher but straight to right field where The Babe is charging in like a rhino straight for Cobb. Somewhere near second base the two giants collide in a thunderous smash, falling to the ground in a brawl, as 48 players slug it out in the b.g. DISSOLVE TO: \n98    EXT. ROUTE 66 (SOUTHWEST) - DUSK                             98 \nThe car races into the sunset, Cobb babbling on... STUMP (V.O.) During the day, we worked on his version of the story. At night I worked on mine... \nCUT TO: \n99    INT.

I was drinking like a fish, smoking cigarettes again, and now lying about the hidden manuscript. (beat) And by writing two versions without telling him, I was becoming something Cobb was not. (beat) I was becoming a liar. An O.S. RUMBLE -- Stump quickly hides the manuscript as: \nCobb thunders in with the typewritten version, the ver- sion written for Cobb's approval. COBB Fabulous stuff, Stumpy, just brilliant. You're a genius. STUMP Thanks, Ty... COBB I love reading about me. \nCobb takes a swig of booze. Some routine outside noise drifts in, young people LAUGHING and CARRYING ON. COBB Goddamn it, who's out there? Cobb hurries outside, drawing his pistol. \nCUT TO: \n101   EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT                                           101 \nCobb charges outside -- FIRING his PISTOL into the air. The manager and a security guard hurry over. Followed quickly by Stump, who's now an expert at this. \nSTUMP (V.O.) He shot up his share of motels for all the usual reasons -- guests were too noisy, he couldn't get any sleep, it didn't matter -- he was always boiling over... (CONTINUED) \n101   CONTINUED:                                                      101 Stump leads Cobb back inside and calms the locals. \nSTUMP ... and I became expert at keeping the peace wherever we went... \n108   CONTINUED:    (3)                                               108 COCHRANE Thanks, Ty. \nAnd Cochrane exits, leaving Cobb with Stump once again. COBB He's lost, Stumpy, the poor man's been lost ever since he took a fastball in the ear. STUMP You take care of him? COBB For years -- but that ain't goin' in the book. \nSTUMP Jesus, Ty, why not? COBB Because it would embarrass him. Cobb winces as he tries to rise, almost falling. COBB I don't wanta take the cane tonight. \nSTUMP You've got to have your cane. COBB I don't have to have anything -- if you stay near me... in case I wobble or something... just a firm hand right here... (touches his own lower back) That'll keep me upright. I'd appreciate it. Now how do I look? Cobb poses in his tux -- proudly, unsurely. \nSTUMP You look like the greatest ballplayer of all time. You going to be okay? \nCOBB I'll be okay when I hear the crowd. CUT TO: \n109   EXT. HALL OF FAME BUILDING - NIGHT                           109 A crowd of locals has gathered and is cheering as the great old warriors of baseball get out of one limo after another and pass a phalanx of security guards, television cameras, and photogaphers. A P.A. ANNOUNCER presents each one. \nP.A. ANNOUNCER The great left-handed pitcher from the New York Giants, who struck out five men in a row in the 19-- All-Star game -- Carl Hubbell.

A line of lightning signals a storm in the distance. COBB Oh, I'll do that, too. (beat) And look how convenient you've made it. \nThey look up -- The entrance to the Royston Cemetery.        A casually-maintained slope of several acres up a hill. \nSTUMP That was your sister alright, and she didn't want anything to do with you either! \nCOBB I forgive her. Stump walks into the cemetery to escape Cobb, who follows nonetheless with a cool resolution. Stump laughs at Cobb's comment.

You're too angry. You're all pent up. \nSTUMP I'm angry? Through the cemetery they keep walking, up a long hill full of tombstones and shrines and sprays of dead and dying flowers and gaudy plastic bouquets.

How about the brunette in the courtyard? Is she your friend? I heard she fucks everybody -- she must be everybody's friend! A mausoleum looms behind Stump, bigger than anything in the cemetery, classical, outsized, monumental, even elegant. One simple word is above the door, carved in granite: COBB. COBB I'm glad we're here -- I was gonna bring you here anyway sooner or later -- Stump turns to see the mausoleum, and the word COBB. STUMP Which Cobb of Georgia is that? Several beats as the men take it all in.

Ty Cobb brings the family together at last to enter the gates of Heaven whole! \nCOBB You mock my family -- you mock me. Cobb grabs Stump by the throat and stares him in the eye. COBB My father was a great man! STUMP Then why are you such a bastard? \nCOBB Being a bastard is a small price to pay for greatness. I, too, am a great man. \nSTUMP Let me go! \nCOBB My mother didn't kill my father. STUMP What're you talking about? Cobb's fist clinches Stump's throat, forcing him to hear. Outside the mausoleum, RAIN pours down now, a Southern spring thunderstorm unleashing torrents. \nCOBB My father told my mother he was leaving town for the weekend but he came back to the edge of the woods where he tied up his horse...

STUMP Papers? \nCOBB I'm afraid it's divorce, Stumpy. I know this routine. MAN WITH BRIEFCASE You're being sued for divorce. \nSTUMP But my wife and I are still talking?! COBB Yeah, and what she's saying is 'fuck you.' STUMP Fuck me? Well fuck her.     No, fuck him. Stump reaches for the gun and aims it at the man. \nSTUMP You ain't serving me no papers. \nThe Man is frozen with terror as Stump rises from the chair -- drunk and crazed, aiming the shaky gun. MAN WITH BRIEFCASE I'm just doing a job. \nSTUMP I love my wife. \nCOBB We all loved our wives, Al, that's got nothing to do with it.

Stump FIRES at the man but the shot goes wild. He's drunk, he's not experienced with guns, he's shaking. STUMP I am not going to accommodate this man, Tyrus. COBB You're all mixed up.   Give me the gun. STUMP You're absolutely right, Tyrus, I've been accommodating people my whole life and it stops right here. (beat) You've killed a man. I'll kill a man. KABLAM!   KABLAM!

Stump tries to hold the gun with two hands, approaching the man, to nearly point-blank range. \nCOBB Al... no... Al... Al... \nStump looks crazed, a bathrobe falling open, his feet bare and wet, his hair awry from the rainstorm. He aims the gun at the man's head, looks at Cobb with wild glee.

You're my friend, Ty, right? You're my friend! \nCOBB No! Stump pulls the TRIGGER -- CLICK.     Empty. \nAs the Man looks up, realizing he's alive, Stump strikes him across the face with the gun, drawing blood. \nThe Man scrambles to his feet and races from the room, grabbing his briefcase, and running to the door. MAN WITH BRIEFCASE You're crazy! No wonder she wants to divorce you! You're crazy! And the Man runs into the rainy night, leaving Cobb and Stump. Stump's head collapses in his hands -- Bewildered, exhausted. The two men sit alone for several beats before Stump speaks. He is completely lost. STUMP I almost killed a man. COBB A little drunken excess... STUMP No. I put a gun to a man's head and pulled the trigger. I wanted to kill him. \nCOBB It's forgotten already. I saw nothing. Nothing happened. \nSTUMP Yes it did.

Attorneys are pigs -- divorce attorneys are lower than pigs. What happened tonight was private. An intimacy. Your own business. Our own business. Nobody else's. It wouldn't belong in a book about greatness. STUMP Nobody's gonna write my biography. COBB And when the brunette in the courtyard brushed against you, I know what happened, Al. A warm summer breeze, the smell of jasmine, her black hair against a white blouse -- you came to life again, you got hard -- and when you saw her naked it was more than you could bear... it's okay, Al, it's okay... (beat) The brunette ain't gonna be in the book either... Stump looks up at Cobb but says nothing. He picks up a nearly-empty bottle off the floor and takes a hit. COBB And the drinking? Well, they used to say ol' Ty had a drinking problem but you can booze me right under the table right now... no problem... and nobody's God damn business, either...

COBB No... no... no... this can't be... Absolutely not... This is not right... Cobb coughs again -- More blood covers his chin. He touches his chin, touches the blood, smears it around a little, looks at his hands now covered with blood. COBB (terrified) Stumpy?! No... \nCobb moves around the tiny bathroom like a caged animal. He falls to his knees in prayer in front of the sink. COBB Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed by Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive -- (beat) Aw, fuck it... little late for that sob sister stuff... Cobb rises to his feet and looks in the mirror again.

And Cobb launches in as he accelerates down the mountain, every curve risking death. He seems at peace with the world -- in the driver's seat, literally, on the edge of being utterly out of control. COBB I suppose you want to know about my childhood. Writers usually do. STUMP None of this 'know ye that a prince and great man has fallen' stuff -- COBB My philosophy is simply this   -- Life is too short to be diplomatic.

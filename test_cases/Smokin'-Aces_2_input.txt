EXT. PENTHOUSE HALLWAY -- SAME 
They amass around the elevator, taking care to double handcuff Ivy now. Mustache pushes the call button. It fails to light. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELEVATOR CAR -- SAME 
Choked with generator and road flare smoke, lit like hell itself. The Tremors stand at arms, shrouded in a miasmic mung of horribly toxic fumes, filling their lungs with it. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. HALLWAY -- SAME 
Mustache hits the call button again, still nothing.   Yet one of the lifts appears to be ascending 
SECURITY TEAM Wait...one of 'em looks like it's on its way up... 
MUSTACHE What about the other four?   Are they out? 
He keeps hitting the call button, but it won't light. 
MUSTACHE (CONTD) (CONT'D) The hell is going on... 
WATTERS (V.O.) ...Forget it, it's dead. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY -- FOURTEENTH FLOOR -- SAME 
Sykes, trying to pry the elevator doors open. 
SYKES It ain't dead! Quit saying that shit! 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- TOP FLOOR -- SAME 
Watters pours herself a glass of Chablis from the mini-bar. 
WATTERS Girl, I just saw muzzle flashes comin' out that suite. S'probably where you heard that shootin' earlier, somebody jus' downed Israel. He dead, our play is dead. 
Sykes, getting some separation on the elevator doors, pulling her 9mm, using it like a crowbar. 
SYKES I'm not givin' it up jus' yet... 
WATTERS C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps. (beat, probing) ...Maybe spend the night? 
Sykes, struggling, when the doors suddenly retract on their own...She's staggered by what she sees in the elevator, tripping back, heels catching, dumping her on her ass-- 
SYKES (just above whisper) ...oh...damn... 
She sits up, stupefied...cordite and pistol smoke drift out of the open elevator doors like a funeral dirge. The sound of a bone-saw emanates from within. 
INT. ELEVATOR CAR 
Carruthers and Acosta...wartorn, shot to hell, post-battle standoff, just staring, weapons emptied, bodies bullet- punctured, leaking life...both are breathing, but just barely. 
WATTERS (OVER HEADSET) What is it...? 
Filament and glass dust cover everything. Blood streams in steaming fissures, floating spent shell casings and fluorescent shards cover the floor of the car. 
Acosta, clinging to life itself, clutching the whirring bone saw, trying in vain to reach Carruthers. Sykes wades forward, wary, Glock vise-gripped. 
SYKES ...Shhhhhhit...girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up... 
WATTERS What? 
SYKES (beat, looking around) They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was. 
WATTERS ...What are they doin' right now...? 
Sykes, glancing from Carruthers to Acosta. A beat. 
SYKES Right now? (beat) ...Dying. 
CUT TO: 
INT. "LAKEY'S SOUVENIR SHOPPE" -- KITCHENETTE -- DAY 
Elmore, seated, wrapped in quilts and heated blankets, shivering horribly, lips blackened, flexing brittle fingers on his good hand, trying to restore feeling, teeth clattering like ten thousand tea cups. Margie Turlock enters, arms loaded down, grandson Warren hot on her heels, a set of Nunchukas under his arm... 
...Elmore, palpable hatred, pure bile for the boy. 
Margie sets the assortment of goods down on the table in front of Elmore; tourist-themed hats & sweatsuits from the shop, a pair of thermals, a collection of pill bottles and what appears to be an old Vietnam-era ammo box. 
MARGIE So them fellas were your friends then? The ones that was shot and tossed into the lake? Were they police officers too?

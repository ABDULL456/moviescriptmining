ANNA What the hell has that got to do with it? 
A pause.     Stepan sips his vodka. 
STEPAN It is not natural to mix race and race. That is why your baby died inside you. 
Anna slams her napkin onto the table. 
HELEN Stepan, shut up! (Anna gets to her feet) Please Anna. 
Helen takes Anna's hand but she turns and leaves. Helen stands to follow her, but first she whips Stepan's vodka away from him. 
HELEN (CONT'D) You're just how he was. Stupid bloody drunken Russians. 
22   EXT. HELEN'S HOUSE. GARDEN - NIGHT                              22 
The garden is just outside the kitchen. 
Anna is lighting a cigarette. Helen steps outside and reacts to the cigarette. She is about to admonish Anna for smoking, but Anna speaks first.

ANNA It's Christmas. I'm thirty-one. 
A pause.     Anna blows smoke, clearly upset. 
HELEN Anna, you know what he's like. 
ANNA I don't give a damn about Stepan. Who has that poor baby got in the whole world? 
Helen reacts. 
HELEN I knew this would happen. 
ANNA Good. Fine.     So you know everything. 
HELEN Anna, she isn't your responsibility. 
ANNA The baby is my responsibility until I hand her over to the mother. The mother is dead. 
HELEN Then it's up to the proper authorities. 
Anna smiles as if in agreement. 
ANNA The proper authorities will all be skiing until after New Year. 
Anna coughs a little then stubs her cigarette.        Helen takes the butt as if it were poisonous. 
HELEN It's part of the grieving. 
ANNA What grieving? 
Helen touches her hand.      An inadequate gesture.

HELEN In the last year you've lost your father and you lost a baby. 
Anna is irritated but doesn't put words to her feelings. 
HELEN (CONT'D) Come in and have your dinner. 
ANNA I'm not hungry. 
Anna and Helen look into each other's eyes for a moment before Helen heads for the kitchen, carrying the cigarette butt as if it were a deadly snake. 
22A   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -22A NIGHT 
In a private room in the Special Care Baby Unit, Anna approaches Tatiana's baby's plastic crib. The baby is tightly bundled up, sound asleep. Through the windows of the room, we see the darkened, quiet ward outside - another world. 
Anna stands over the baby, her face full of emotion. There we see pain, loss, shame, emptiness, isolation. Tears begin to roll from her eyes, and then she is sobbing soundlessly. 
23    INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        23 
The Trans-Siberian restaurant is smoky with cigarettes and cigars. The party is in full swing with two dozen guests and family. One of the golden-haired children is playing violin badly. The language is Russian, English and Turkish mixed. Kirill is bringing a huge baked carp to the table. His mobile phone rings and he wipes his hands on a towel to answer it. 
When he hears the voice, Kirill glances at his father and moves quickly out of earshot. Semyon notices but hides his concern. As Kirill walks, a child tugs his leg and holds up a soft toy, asking a question in Russian. 
KIRILL (to child) He's called Goofy... Goofy yeah. (into phone) So the coast is clear, yeah? What? I said `coast'. (MORE)

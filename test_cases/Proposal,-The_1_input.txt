DEBBIE I thought so dear. Debbie leaves and shuts the door.   Margaret reverts back to her old self. 
MARGARET I'm about 15 seconds from bitch. 
RICHARD Calm down. 
MARGARET What is going on here? 
RICHARD Hell if I know. 
MARGARET You had no idea they knew about us getting married? 
RICHARD You think I'd bring you here if I did? 
MARGARET Well, we just gotta tell âem. 
RICHARD Tell âem what? 
MARGARET Tell âem the truth.   About us. 
RICHARD Wrong answer.   No way. 
MARGARET What do you mean no way?   This is crazy. 
RICHARD No, crazy was lying to the federal officer. 
MARGARET Well I don't like this. 
RICHARD Well I'm not making my Gammy an accomplice to a Class C felony!   For one second could you not be so selfish? 
MARGARET Selfish? 
RICHARD Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you only worry about yourself every second of every day? 
MARGARET How is it selfish to tell the truth? 
RICHARD Look.   We're awful, awful people.   In the last forty eight hours, we've lied to... everyone.   We need to protect the people downstairs.   We can't ask these good, decent, not awful people to lie for us. Let's keep the darkside to ourselves. Margaret takes a second to make up her mind. 
MARGARET Fine.   But if we do this, you need to stop lying to me. 
RICHARD What've I lied to you about? 
MARGARET Why did you tell me that you were poor? 
RICHARD I never said that. 
MARGARET Well, you never told me you were rich. 
RICHARD When does that come up? 
MARGARET I don't know, how about, "Hi, my name is Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry." 
RICHARD Well, maybe I didn't tell you because you would have fired me if you knew. 
MARGARET No I wouldn't. 
RICHARD Come on!   You're always yammering on about your scrappy childhood, and how you fought for those soccer scholarships, and how the rich kids made fun of you in prep school for working in the kitchen.   You're totally anti- rich. 
MARGARET I'm not anti-rich. 
RICHARD Oh yes you are!   And you know what makes it worse?   You have money! 
MARGARET I earned... 
RICHARD ...every penny I have.   Blah, blah, blah. You need new material. 
MARGARET Hey.   Watch it.   You're still my assistant.

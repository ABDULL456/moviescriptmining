WANDA He asked me if I liked jazz, I said yes, and he suggested we meet tonight at a jazz club. 
WOLF I like jazz. 
WANDA He did not invite you. (applies perfume) 
WOLF Why are you wearing perfume to work? 
WANDA Because I feel like it. 
WOLF You didn't wear it yesterday. 
WANDA Oh, stop it. You're acting like a child. 
Wanda playfully swipes at Wolf's face with a negligee she is returning to the closet. It misses him completely. 
WOLF My eye! 
WANDA Oh, God. Sweetheart, are you alright? 
WOLF Do I look alright?! 
WANDA Let me see. Christ, we're going to be late. 
Wanda sits and perfunctorily examines Wolf's eye. 
INT. CAR. DAWN 
The car is parked outside a rather seedy hotel. JEFF, the Intern and NICK, the Director, sit quietly in the motionless car. 
NICK Should we call up to the room again? 
JEFF He said he'd be right down. 
Nick lets out a huge yawn. 
JEFF Tired? 
NICK I'm exhausted. I dreamt I was on the set all night. I was just trying to do one shot and everything kept going wrong. 
JEFF That's an anxiety dream. Are you anxious about something? 
NICK I don't know. Sometimes I wonder what the hell I'm doing in this business. It's all just one compromise and disappointment after another. I don't know if I have the personality for it. 
JEFF Sounds kind of like an identity crisis. 
NICK Maybe you're right. Who am I? What am I really capable of? Maybe I should just get a job teaching at a women's college somewhere. 
JEFF How'd you get into cinematography? 
NICK I'm not a cinematographer. 
JEFF You're not? 
NICK No. I'm directing this movie. 
JEFF (pause) How'd you get into directing? 
INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN 
In the dim light of the hotel room, CHAD PALOMINO dresses quickly. He is young, handsome, with long blond hair. A WOMAN sits nude on the bed, her back to the camera. The faint sound of a shower comes from the adjacent bathroom. 
PALOMINO They're waiting downstairs. 
WOMAN Go ahead, I'll take a taxi. 
PALOMINO Oh, OK. Listen, I've got to tell you, I had a lot of fun last night, really, but for me, where I'm at right now in my life, a relationship is...

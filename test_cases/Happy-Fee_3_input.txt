MUMBLE Give me a year, just until the next great gathering. If I don't make it back ....at least I tried 
ELLA But... 
MUMBLE Now go back. I love you. Go. 
Ella returns to the community. As she does so, CARUSO begins to CHANT the Gathering answers. 
CARUSO "Together we stand" 
ALL "Divided we freeze." 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (7) 
ALL (CONT'D) Recite the Wisdoms! 
ALL (CONT'D) "In the Wisdoms we trust." 
CARUSO "When all others leave..." 
ALL "We Remain." 
CARUSO Louder. More fervent bretheren. "When the Sun vanishes..." 
ALL "We Remain." 
ELLAS watches through tears as the tiny figures of Mumble and the Adelies dwindle to specks and disappear into the mist. 
THE ICE SHELF 
Mumble and the Adelies have put the colony far behind, trekking homewards 
ADELIES Tell me again where we're going. 
MUMBLE To find the mystic beings. 
ADELIES How do we know where they live. 
MUMBLE We'll ask Loveday. He's been there. 
ADELIELAND 
Most of the Adelies are sitting on nests. The Adeleies and Mumble trek past them a protective mother takes a peck at them. 
MOTHER ...Not so close. We got babies on board 
ADELIES ...Wow. Does nesting make em touchy 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
They find LOVEDAY at the back of what is left of his PEBBLE PILE. He sits leaning against it...exhausted. 
THE ADELIES ...LOVEDAY, you okay?? ...what happened ...Too much boom-boom for one penguin? 
MUMBLE kicks a bunch of pebbles at him. 
MUMBLE Just one question! And I want a straight answer! Where do I find the Mystic Beings? 
LOVEDAY tries to raise himself up. A tight low gurgling rumbles from his throat. 
AN ADELIE Why don't he speak? 
LOVEDAY gurgles and points wildly to the SIX-PACK PLASTIC round his neck. 
AN ADELIE (CONT'D) Talisman...sounds like Talisman!!

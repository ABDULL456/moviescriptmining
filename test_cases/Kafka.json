{"train": "\"Kafka\", by Lem Dobbs \nKAFKA \nby \nLem Dobbs \nPRAGUE - MORNING \nThe Old Town is quiet.  It's very early in the twisted streets of this ancient ghetto.  Dark corners casting a medieval spell over a modern century oblivious to their romance and mystery. \nThe River is the dividing line.  Elegant gardens on the opposite bank embracing the monotonous solemnity of the New Town, tower steeples silhouetted against the sombre sky. \nAn empty motor bus rattles along a deserted street. \nA Gothic bridge links the two halves of the strange city. Its half-moon arches becoming circles as they meet their reflections in the water.  Thin mist swirls over the cobblestones above. \nA few boats in the water.  Fishermen casting their lines in silence.  One or two lights now burning in buildings beyond. \nIn the Old Town Square the great clock on the cathedral strikes six. \nCUT: \nA MAN'S FACE \nHis eyes filled with terror, beads of sweat crawling on his brow. \nHe stands in the middle of a murky courtyard, perfectly still.  Waiting.  Watching. \nThe balconies overlooking on successive floors, looming all around him, are empty.  All is quiet. \nThe man's name is EDUARD.  He dares not move for fear of missing a single sound.  And then he hears it.  A small noise of movement nearby.  He runs. \nTINY ALLEYWAY \nHe runs alone in the dim light of the deserted morning. \nCROOKED PASSAGEWAY \nRunning for his life. \nNARROW LANE \nRunning on sheer pumping fear, long after the verge of collapse. \nBLACK TUNNEL \nComing out into the light, but by no means out of danger, he allows himself a brief pause, gasping for air, just for a moment looking back into the gloom, starting to retreat again even as he does, then turning running ... \nWINDING STREET \nHe runs on, past boarded-up houses and shuttered inns, strange relics of the Middle Ages casting frightening shadows. \nAROUND A CORNER \nEduard appears suddenly, quickly flattens himself back against the large notice board that covers the wall here, layers of expressionistic theatre and film posters pasted on it. \nHe breathes painfully in short bursts, as silently as he can.  He watches the corner he's just come from, the ornate archway through which any pursuer must emerge. \nNothing there.  But then a shadow moves. \nEduard's shoulders tense.  His eyes widen.  He holds his breath. \nThe shadow ... spreading ... \nEduard edges away ever so slowly, keeping his unblinking gaze on the archway, backing off, one arm brushing the notice board as he feels his way along it, macabre images on the posters, some torn and incomplete, revealing other fragments behind, Eduard's eyes staring constant, no noise here at all and -- \nA HAND!  clamps over his face from behind.  All of a sudden and out of absolutely nowhere and not a thing he can do about it. \nLODGING HOUSE - MIDDAY \nKafka comes up the stairs to the top landing.  He knocks on a door.  Waits.  Knocks again.  Leans a little closer to listen for a moment, then goes away back down the stairs. \nGROUND FLOOR \nKafka comes through the door that divides the stairs from the hall, goes to knock on the door of the first apartment down here. \nBIZARRE VOICE Yes? \nKAFKA I'm sorry to disturb you -- I wonder if you know where my friend Eduard is? \nBIZARRE VOICE I can't hear you! -- You'd better come in. \nAPARTMENT \nKafka comes in tentatively, seeing the CONCIERGE in a far corner of the cluttered room, in bed, covers tucked right up to her chin. \nKAFKA -- I didn't want to bother you. \nCONCIERGE Well, you have.  What do you want? \nKAFKA (pointing upstairs) My friend Eduard, I wonder if you've seen him?  He hasn't been in to work, I thought he might be ill. \nCUT: \nSTAIRS \nThe Concierge trudges up to the top floor, Kafka following guiltily. \nKAFKA You didn't have to get out of bed -- I could have taken the key. \nCONCIERGE Yes, I'm sure you could. \nShe treats him like dirt. \nEDUARD'S ROOM \nThe door unlocks and the two of them come in.  Kafka goes to open the window curtain.  He turns around to see the Concierge already poking about in drawers. \nHe ignores her and looks around the room on his own.  Eduard isn't here.  Nothing else seems out of place.  He wonders instead how he can dissuade the Concierge from her unbelievable snooping. \nKAFKA Well, he's not here. \nThe Concierge takes a tie from one of the drawers and models it over her own ample chest. \nKAFKA Do you think you ought to do that? \nShe looks at him indignantly. \nCONCIERGE The manners of a tramp!  It's my house, isn't it? \nCUT: \nOFFICES - AFTERNOON \nKafka is in another section of the building, finding his way through a department he's vaguely unfamiliar with.  He searches out a particular person -- a strikingly beautiful woman with flaming hair and wild eyes. \nKAFKA Miss Rossmann? \nGABRIELA looks around from a file cabinet. \nKAFKA I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident -- \nGABRIELA I know. \nKAFKA You're a friend of Eduard Raban's. \nGABRIELA Why would you suppose so? \nANNA -- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter. \nKAFKA Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past. (abruptly) Has anyone seen Eduard? \nMARGARETE Who? \nMy friend Eduard from the office -- I've brought him here lots of times -- you used to marvel at his travel stories. \nJULIUS Oh, him. \nKAFKA What d'you mean, oh him?  He's a perfectly nice person, he's never missed a day before. \nERNST Perhaps he's taken up with those traveling players you two were so fond of. \nKAFKA No, it's me who always wanted to run away with them -- except that that life would be far too hectic for me.  I'm worried about him, no one's seen him. \nSTELLA Haven't you ever called in sick and gone roaming about, free of responsibility to anyone, if only for a day? \nKAFKA When you work for a medical firm you can't call in sick.  They know malingerers like a dog knows fleas. \nANNA You work in the insurance department? \nKAFKA You have been hearing the sordid side then. \nMARGARETE Be pleased -- you constantly inspire people to take an interest in your life. \nANNA I should think it's very interesting work. \nKafka shrugs shyly. \nKAFKA My father always said I had no ambition. \nCUT: \nNEAR THE FRONT DOOR - LATER \nSmoke heavier in the air, the coffee house more crowded with strange groups of characters.  Kafka and his friends preparing to leave. \nSTELLA The cabaret will be packed this time of night -- we'll never get in. \nJULIUS Well, it has to be the cabaret because there's nowhere else to go. \nMARGARET Home, I think. \nJULIUS Home? \nMARGARET (head on Ernst's shoulder) You know I can't stay up late. \nVOICE Home is the last resort -- \nBIZZLEBEK \nThe owner of the voice.  A man sitting at the bar nearby, turning on his stool to face them.  A dissipated dandy of a man. \nERNST (introducing him) -- Do you know Bizzlebek -- the gravedigger? \nBIZZLEBEK Stonecutter, if you please. \nMARGARETE Sculptor, if only he'd admit it. \nBIZZLEBEK No one should admit being an artist unless they're paid for it.  If you go to the cabaret mention my name -- they'll find a table for you. \nTurning round again. \nERNST Bizzlebek has ways and means denied lesser mortals.  It comes from working in the cemetery all day -- he's able to transcent the physical world. \nBizz1ebek turns round again, with a bored sign. \nBIZZLEBEK No -- it only makes me view people dispassionately as so many ... slabs. \nMARGARETE Don't worry about your friend -- I'm sure he'll turn up. \nERNST (a parting word) What are you working on, Kafka? \nKAFKA I'm writing a story about a man who wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a giant insect. \nHis friends glance at each other surreptitiously and don't know what to say -- other than goodnight \nKAFKA \nTurns to go -- when he notices Bizzlebek leaning listlessly in the coffee house doorway.  A figure in the shadows. \nBIZZLEBEK I've read your stories.  They're fantastic. \nKAFKA (not sure if he believes him) I don't know what you could have read. \nBIZZLEBEK Just what you've published. \nKAFKA -- In magazines nobody reads. \nBIZZLEBEK I read the one about the penal colony. \nKAFKA (cautious) Did you? \nBIZZLEBEK The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man. (looks impressed) Very good. \nKafka suspects he's being mocked.  But perhaps not. Bizzlebek steps out, buttoning his coat. \nBIZZLEBEK If I could sculpt as well as that, I'd be quite proud of myself. \nHe's already quite proud of himself -- tossing his scarf over his shoulder with a flourish -- and striding off into the night. \nCUT: \nTHE CASTLE - NIGHT \nSeen from just below, from the ancient cemetery that borders its high, impregnable, imperial walls.  The all-seeing-eye of the city.  An awesome edifice. \nTHE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER \nKafka walking across from the Old Quarter toward the New Town. \nHe passes some working-class types who seem vaguely threatening.  Do they mutter some remark behind his back? \nCUT: \nALCHEMISTS' ROW - NIGHT \nA bizarre street.  Tiny little houses that look fashioned by a toymaker, all bunched tightly next to each other, forming a continuous rooftop of odd configurations and angles and pointed chimneys.  The street named after practitioners of the black arts and dark sciences who inhabited it in the Sixteenth Century. \nKafka's house is toward the back, a light shining from the single upper window.  Through it, Kafka is seen sitting at the only desk that really matters to him -- his writing one. \nKAFKA'S ROOM \nHe's struggling to get a sentence right -- rereading it to himself. \nKAFKA \"As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from disturbing dreams he ... from unsettling dreams ... uneasy dreams ... Gregor Samsa ... Gregor ...?\" (wondering) Carl.  George.  Rudolf ... \nSuddenly there's a loud KNOCK on the front door below. \nDOWNSTAIRS \nKafka opens the tiny front door of this almost-miniature little house.  Two intimidating MEN stand outside, one tall, one short, wearing similar black suits and grim expressions. \nCUT: \nANOTHER DOOR - NIGHT \nKafka tries to match the exacting pace of his two warders, flanking him as they walk him along a corridor, through another doorway. \nINSPECTOR His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to. \nKAFKA I don't think he really had any. He had no family either. \nINSPECTOR We know that. \nPause. \nKAFKA He wasn't a lonely man, though. \nINSPECTOR What makes you think so? \nKAFKA ... Just a perception. \nCUT: \nHALLWAY \nKafka comes out of a door that closes behind him.  He stands and waits.  At a high desk a POLICEMAN is reading a newspaper.  Without even looking up from it he extends his arm and pushes Kafka slightly to one side so he's no longer blocking the light. \nTwo other MEN are here waiting, sitting on a bench, sharing a private joke.  Kafka glances down at himself, wondering if his appearance could in any way inspire ridicule. \nThe door opens again and the Inspector is back. \nINSPECTOR I don't usually involve myself with you people in the Old Quarter -- but the River runs its own course. It won't be the last time it deposits its unwanted debris on my doorstep. \nPause. \nKAFKA Probably not. \nINSPECTOR Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party. \nKAFKA I'll bear that in mind. \nINSPECTOR (hands Kafka his card) -- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant. \nHe nods curtly at Kafka, and shuts his door. \nTHE TROLLEY \nWith Eduard's sheet-covered form on it, coming down the hall, the SQUEAKING WHEELS of the thing loud on the wooden floor. \nKAFKA \nThe noise causes him to turn around.  He watches the trolley as it's pushed past. \nCUT: \nAN OFFICE TROLLEY - DAY \nSimilarly coffin-like, loaded with files. \nKAFKA \nEdges out of the way to let it by, feeling as though it has been made for him, is waiting for him. \nHe walks on to the Chief Clerk's office. \nCHIEF CLERK'S OFFICE \nKafka comes in. \nKAFKA You wanted to see me, sir. \nCHIEF CLERK (indicates a chair) Sit down, Kafka. \nKafka does.  And the Chief Clerk stands up.  He paces up and down a bit, making Kafka awfully nervous before he finally clears his throat and starts to get to the point. \nCHIEF CLERK You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving. \nBURGEL It's what I'm paid to do. \nGABRIELA You're detestable. \nBURGEL And you're late! \nSuddenly, in a terrific release of pent-up emotion, she slaps him hard across the cheek, the first of what would be a flurry of blows if not for the fact that the unexpected force of it throws Burgel reeling backwards before she can deliver any more.  Instead she rushes away, very upset. \nKAFKA \nAs startled as the rest of the office by the incident. \nBurgel recovers, straightening up in shock and embarrassment.  He immediately resolves to march directly to the office of the Chief Clerk. \nSeeing him coming, Kafka quickly starts away. \nCUT: \nTHE ASSISTANTS - DAY \nOSKAR and LUDWIG.  They look almost the same.  At first glance almost identical.  It's only a closer inspection that shows them to be imperfect twins.  Dressed in matching suits. \nOne is sitting on Kafka's new desk, the other in Kafka's new chair.  They're rummaging about in his papers, and whenever one selects a particular document for closer scrutiny, the other promptly snatches it out of his hand. \nKAFKA \nComing this way, has paused, having spotted the weird duo. \nTHE ASSISTANTS \nContinue with their mischief until one of them notices Kafka coming and nudges the other so strongly he almost falls over.  They're both standing at attention, looking guilty, by the time Kafka arrives. \nKAFKA My assistants, I presume. \nASSISTANTS Yes -- that's us. \nKafka smiles at them, half in friendliness, half in amusement at their quirky appearance. \nKAFKA (offers his hand) I'm Kafka. \nOskar responds first, but Ludwig knocks his hand out of the way to get there first. \nLUDWIG (shaking hands) Ludwig. \nOSKAR (now it's his turn) Oskar. \nKAFKA You look like brothers. \nASSISTANTS Yes -- we do. \nKAFKA Have you worked here long? \nASSISTANTS No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes. \nKafka doesn't quite know what to make of these two, but they seem pleasant enough fellows and they're looking at him with such wide-eyed innocence he doesn't know what more to say to them.  So he turns to look around the new area he's been assigned -- a burrow all to himself now -- even a personal clothes peg on the wall for his coat. \nThe Assistants make stupid faces at each other behind his back, but look serious again when he turns around. \nKAFKA Well, we'd better move things from my old desk. \nASSISTANTS \nLook at each other with identical frowns, then back at Kafka.  Oskar nods, as if to say \"oh, all right, if we must.\"  And Ludwig grins. \nCUT: \nKAFKA'S NEW OFFICE - DAY \nKafka types up forms.  He hears some noise and glances over his shoulder to see how the Assistants are getting on -- they're sharing another desk, facing each other, and seem to be working quietly, though with pouting expressions. \nSomeone else has paused at the embankment wall further away to stare at the roiling water.  He's too far away to see clearly.  Probably nothing sinister about him at all. Still ... \nGABRIELA \nTurns back to Kafka. \nGABRIELA Are you free tonight? \nKAFKA Tonight? \nGABRIELA There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock? \nKAFKA ... All right. \nHer eyes lock on his for a moment.  She's beautiful.  He's fearful. \nGABRIELA You almost married recently, didn't you? \nKAFKA Last year.  I -- it was broken off. \nGABRIELA Eduard wanted to marry me. \nKAFKA And you ...? \nGABRIELA I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers. \nTHE SHADOW ON THE WALL BENEATH \nDisappears, the ominous black mass flowing off the large flat surface as abruptly as it arrived.  While up there on the terrace we see Gabriela walk away from Kafka. \nKAFKA \nStays where he is a moment, watching her.  He may have found his ideal woman. \nKAFKA (then follows behind her) -- I don't know the Musil district. \nGABRIELA (without turning) You won't have any trouble finding it. \nCUT: \nFAT MEN - NIGHT \nSit laughing, jowls gyrating, around a table filled with an abnormal amount of food.  One of them stops laughing then, and the others follow suit, one after the other in turn, until they're all silent, looking at the same thing. \nWe're in a fancy restaurant, and the other customers have also turned away from their dinners for the moment to stare at the Man in Black who stands before the Fat Men. \nThe man wears a black mask as well.  He presents the Fat Men with a covered tray.  They look at it, then back at him -- but he's walked away.  They look at the tray again -- and one of them lifts the cover.  Underneath lies the classic black bowling ball -- with a fuse burning at the top.  The Fat Men all try to stand up at once but -- \nBOOM!  Their booth explodes with them in it. \nAt the doorway, holding a revolver loosely in one hand to discourage heroes, the Man in Black turns calmly to face the stunned restaurant. \nMAN IN BLACK (hoarse voice) Long live anarchy! \nHe leaves.  Fire in his wake. \nCUT: \nTHE OLD TOWN - NIGHT \nKafka walks the crooked streets -- in the direction of the plume of smoke and illumination coming from the burning restaurant. \nIn the dark distance behind him there seems to be a person following him. \nNOISY BEER SHOP \nNeighborhood denizens have come out, hearing all the excitement not far away.  Kafka walks past.  He looks behind him, but the following figure has gone. \nTWISTED LITTLE STREET \nGABRIELA He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant. \nPOCKMARKED ANARCHIST -- Merely in the interests of order, you understand.  The officials at the Castle like to cover their tracks. \nGABRIELA He was never seen alive again. \nKAFKA And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered. \nGABRIELA He was murdered. \nA skylight casts moonglow over the proceedings. \nBEARDED ANARCHIST As you can imagine, a pass into the Castle -- hardly ever granted -- was an opportunity we couldn't ignore. \nYOUTHFUL ANARCHIST The Castle represents every anachronism that needs to be destroyed if progress is to be made. \nBEARDED ANARCHIST As you know, it's not the most accessible location.  Far from being depressed, Eduard was particularly excited when he brought us the news of this chance invitation. He set off that evening carrying one of our custom-made briefcases instead of his own. \nGABRIELA (gauging Kafka's reaction) You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window. \nKAFKA I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil. \nGABRIELA When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression. \nKAFKA People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person. \nBEARDED ANARCHIST You don't have to accept everything as true, my friend.  You need only accept it as necessary. \nGABRIELA As the bomb never went off, we can only assume he was caught with it -- and summarily executed. \nPOCKMARKED ANARCHIST -- Merely in the interests of order. \nBEARDED ANARCHIST The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support. \nKAFKA Propaganda of the dead? \nYOUTHFUL ANARCHIST The Castle will deny he was there any longer than his business required. They're just file clerks up there.  No doubt he was handed over to the police with the utmost discretion. \nBEARDED ANARCHIST In any event, we've felt no repercussions as yet.  Eduard must not have talked.  You're the one they contacted. \nKAFKA So that's who my foes are -- policemen and file clerks.  Law and order, you might say. \nThe Solemn Anarchist looks up from his matchbox. \nGABRIELA You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal? \nKAFKA My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours? \nGABRIELA Yes -- which is why \"quiet, dependable people\" have to take charge of their own lives. \nKAFKA At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard? (apparently not) Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there. \nHe stands to leave again. \nGABRIELA Your human tribunal will betray you.  Just as its members will be betrayed when they find no supreme one \nKafka starts walking away. \nGABRIELA Join us, Kafka. \nKafka keeps on going, the anarchists growing smaller as they're left behind in their far corner of the long attic. \nGABRIELA It's sheer folly for anyone to try to pull through alone. \nCUT: \nMANIACAL LAUGHTER - BEFORE DAWN \nSeeming to emanate from pitch blackness -- but then suddenly, fast, out of a tunnel under a bridge come running three terrified VAGRANTS, roused from slumber and scared out their wits by the ghastly, crazed CACKLING chasing after them, ECHOING under the arches. \nGABRIELA'S SECTION \nKafka working his way toward Gabriela's desk -- but he stops before he gets to it, a familiar shiver running through him. \nTHE DESK \nEmpty.  The chair pushed squarely under it.  The typewriter covered. \nKAFKA \nStares at it -- then at the ermine Mr. Burgel who has once again popped up out of nowhere. \nBURGEL Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann? \nKAFKA Yes. \nBurgel bows sarcastically to hand Kafka an envelope.  Then chuckles spitefully, obviously knowing something Kafka does not.  He walks off, leaving Kafka uneasy. \nCUT: \nEDUARD'S LODGING HOUSE - DAY \nKafka bounds up the stairs. \nEDUARD'S LANDING \nThe door to his room is open.  Kafka goes in. \nEDUARD'S ROOM \nKafka comes in.  Gabriela is here, gathering up Eduard's belongings from drawers. \nGABRIELA (hardly glancing at him) I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity. \nKAFKA (taking her note from his pocket) Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean? \nGABRIELA (now looks up) Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him. \nKAFKA (going closer) Why were you given notice? \nGABRIELA They're not obliged to tell. \nKAFKA It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day. \nGABRIELA Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  He could've killed Eduard. \nKAFKA You don't believe that. \nGABRIELA I wouldn't put it past him. \nShe's stuffed the last of the clothes into a small bag, goes to take the few other possessions from shelves and elsewhere. \nKafka notices that he's standing by a dumbwaiter.   For lack of anything better to do he pulls the rope to bring it up. It's filled with more clothes.  Gabriela comes over with her bag, holding it out for him as Kafka puts the clothes in -- but not as many clothes as they thought.  Behind the bundle, hidden at the back, is a briefcase. \nGabriela recognizes it.  Kafka sees her surprised reaction. He removes the case and carefully flips the latches.  Inside, a complex mechanism, wires connected to a clock -- and a clump of dynamite. \nKafka just looks at it sadly.  He closes the case. \nKAFKA It seems I knew Eduard a little bit, after all. \nGROUND FLOOR OF BUILDING \nThe ratty old concierge peeks up the stairs inquisitively. In the doorway of his room, a LODGER clips his fingernails at a little folding table, neatly lining them up.  The concierge turns and notices. \nCONCIERGE Lodgers!  Not one of them thinks to spare me such spectacles! \nShe slams the door on him then returns to her own apartment, slamming that door too.  The hallway is empty now. \nEDUARD'S ROOM \nGABRIELA \nRushing down the stairs in anger, tearing open the door at the middle landing and slamming that one too once past it. \nKAFKA \nFollowing her down. \nGABRIELA \nComing down the final flight of stairs, disappearing through the door at the bottom, slamming that one as well. \nKAFKA \nAlmost caught up with her, coming down to the last door. \nGROUND FLOOR HALLWAY \nKafka comes through the door from the stairs, out of breath, and stops.  He's too late.  The hallway is empty.  The front door at the end of it is shut.  He makes a face and a moment later starts to go back up.  Then stops again.  Turns.  Looks back at the front door.  ... The one he didn't hear slam. \nOUTSIDE \nThe front door opens and Kafka steps out.  He stands on  the stoop.  He looks up the street one way.  Deserted.  He looks down the street the other way.  Deserted. \nCUT: \nINSIDE - DAY \nKafka leads the police Inspector back along the lodging house hallway.  The two subordinate policemen follow behind. \nINSPECTOR You said she was extremely upset. People who are extremely upset -- Kafka -- are given to disappearing in a hurry.  They go and calm down for a day or so and then they come back. \nThey've come to the door to the stairs now. \nKAFKA But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one. (points at front door) I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one shut -- not at all. \nINSPECTOR That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction. \nKAFKA If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible? \nThe Inspector stares at him.  The two other policemen roll their eyes at each other. \nCUT: \nEDUARD'S ROOM \nKafka keeps his eye on the two policemen as they poke around, one of them getting close to the dumbwaiter. \nINSPECTOR Why would someone want to kidnap this woman -- the name is Rossmann? \nHe says it rather derisively, separating the syllables of the name. \nKAFKA You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard. \nINSPECTOR That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add. \nKAFKA She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there. \nThe policeman at the dumbwaiter peers down the shaft -- but then moves on. \nINSPECTOR She lost her job today.  Just between you and me, I'd probably go away and brood a bit myself. \nHe signals his men, time for them to go. \nSTAIRWAY \nThe two Policemen lead the way back down, the Inspector behind them, Kafka remaining on the top landing. \nKAFKA (manages to blurt out) Maybe it's true then what she said. \nThe Chief Clerk watches him as he starts to leave. \nCHIEF CLERK Kafka. \nKafka reluctantly turns. \nCHIEF CLERK You're too sensitive.  Let your friend rest in peace. (returning to paperwork) I've known suicides.  Such a song- and-dance about nothing. \nKafka nods once. \nKAFKA Yes, sir. \nThe Chief Clerk looks at him with seemingly genuine misguided concern. \nCHIEF CLERK Give it up. \nHe goes back to his paperwork.  Kafka leaves. \nOUTSIDE CHIEF CLERK'S OFFICE \nKafka shuts the door behind him, breathes a sigh of relief. \nCUT: \nTHE KEEPER OF THE FILES - DAY \nLooking very annoyed, leading Kafka back through the stacks. \nKEEPER If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees? \nKAFKA Orlac is an account? \nKEEPER It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers. (as they disappear around a corner) Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion. \nANOTHER ROW \nKafka glances nervously around as shelves CREAK threateningly under the weight of documents.  Up on a ladder, the Keeper of the Files finds the Orlac folder. \nKEEPER At least the account is current even if the employee isn't. \nHe pulls it out -- with great difficulty.  The Orlac file is very, very thick.  Kafka prepares himself to catch it, but the Keeper of the Files manages to hand it down to him without serious injury.  Still, it's quite cumbersome and heavier than Kafka expects. \nKEEPER (coming down ladder) That place has so many accidents, it's a good thing the type of peasants who live up there don't seem to have any trouble propagating their race. \nKafka winces at that slur but says nothing about it. \nKAFKA (leafing through pages) All these in the last year? \nKEEPER You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed! \nKAFKA I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal. \nKEEPER (nods) Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss. \nKAFKA (a particular document) This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims? \nKEEPER (nods) Is your friend's name among them? (Kafka shakes his head) Then he only worked on the one case. (taking file back again) Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it. \nKAFKA Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review? \nKEEPER (going back up ladder) Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets? \nKAFKA What good are records if they're not open for public inspection? \nKEEPER (stuffing file back in place) These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them? \nKAFKA What if I petitioned one of the Directors? \nKEEPER (coming back down) You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious. \nKAFKA (to Assistants again) All right, you might as well go home -- go on. \nThe Assistants do as they're told, Oskar returning to his desk to clear up, turning his back on Ludwig -- at which Ludwig  immediately rushes up very close behind him and shakes his fist strenuously at him, turning away quickly when Oskar turns around again to try and catch Ludwig at it. \nKafka isn't paying them any attention anymore.  He efficiently cleans up his own space, keeping an eye on the Chief Clerk's office. \nWhen the office bell RINGS the Chief Clerk immediately turns off his desk lamp, puts on his overcoat, and shuts his office light on his way out. \nKafka doesn't think twice.  He forces himself to start walking to the Chief Clerk's office.  Other departing office employees crisscross past him, but he walks in a straight line, businesslike, toward the Chief Clerk's office.  He has a piece of paper in his hand.  He enters the Chief Clerk's office, holds the paper out to drop on the Chief Clerk's desk -- but lets it slip off onto the floor.  When he bends to retrieve it he quickly opens that bottom drawer where Eduard's file was -- but it's now empty. \nCUT: \nDARK STREET - EVENING \nBurgel walks along, adjusting the parcel under his arm. \nKAFKA \nFollowing him. \nCUT: \nACROSS THE RIVER \nBurgel heads into the Old Town. \nKAFKA \nPauses in some shadows.  He glances up at the distance, the way Burgel is going, up at -- \nTHE CASTLE \nAlmost glowing as it's outlined against the blue of the darkening night. \nCUT: \nWHORES \nGiving Kafka the eye as he goes past doorway after doorway filled with their frightening/tempting forms.  But he tries never to lose focus on the small form of Burgel further up the street. \nMen milling about, up and down the street, prostitutes roaming amongst them, Kafka negotiating his way through.  An urgent moment when he almost loses Burgel -- then sees him turning down an alley.  Kafka hurries after him, avoiding a pair of drunken louts in the way. \nFURTHER ON \nThe Castle visible, but still a little in the distance. Kafka comes into view.  He sees Burgel entering a building. \nCUT: \nUPSTAIRS HALLWAY \nVery dingy.  Burgel leaves the top of the stairs and walks down to a room at the end. \nDOWNSTAIRS \nKafka waits momentarily at the bottom, then goes up. \nHALLWAY \nPeeking around the corner, he sees a YOUNG GIRL embracing Burgel in her doorway before letting him in. \nCUT: \nOUTSIDE \nKafka comes out of the building.  He hears a noise, turns around, sees Burgel and the girl on the tiny baroque balcony outside her room.  Kafka retreats into the shadows.  He watches the girl unwrap the parcel Burgel's given her.  She smiles as a box of chocolates is revealed. \nKAFKA \nWatches -- with an expression of guilt, sadness? Until a door suddenly opens at his back.  A MAN shuffles out past him.  A rather ugly WOMAN in a dressing gown holds the door open, giving Kafka a cursory look.  Beyond her inside, a quick glimpse of MASOCHIST yelping as he's whipped. \nLUDWIG Frankly, we don't understand why you've even bothered pursuing this business. \nKAFKA It would be more accurate to say that it has pursued me. \nOSKAR But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult. \nLUDWIG My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip. \nKafka suddenly points at the ground. \nKAFKA You've dropped some money. \nThe Assistants immediately bend their heads to look -- and Kafka bangs them together as hard as he can. \nThe Assistants sit on the ground in a stupefied daze while Kafka's running footsteps echo around the dark street. \nCUT: \nCONTINENTAL COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT \nBizzlebek, perched on his usual stool, turns to see Kafka at his side. \nKAFKA You work in the cemetery. \nBIZZLEBEK A man must eat -- (raises glass) And drink. \nKAFKA The Castle cemetery. \nCUT: \nCEMETERY - NIGHT \nAncient tombstones crumbling with age, slanting out of the ground at bizarre angles, and cluttered so close together that a way can scarcely be made between them. \nBizzlebek leads Kafka along the crooked little pathways, overgrown with crawling weeds, upwards towards the high section of the cemetery under the dark wall of the Castle. \nBizzlebek, who knows his way around, seems more cheerful here than we've seen him before.  Kafka more fearful.  Wind WHISTLES.  Leaves RUSTLE.  CREAKING trees cast ghastly shadows.  Scary tombs, all shapes and sizes, strange symbolic symbols on them, mystical figures and designs. \nTrying to keep up with Bizzlebek, Kafka spots a horrendous shape looming ahead of him.  He starts to bypass it -- and jumps when a tall plant brushes against him. \nBIZZLEBEK (waits for Kafka) Are you sure you wouldn't prefer going through official channels? \nThe awful dark shape turns out to be no more than a particularly large tombstone, crumbled in places to give it an animal-like suggestion. \nKAFKA Official channels -- a lot of good they've done me.  My only hope is to approach the officials personally. \nHe keeps walking -- and we SEE that he's carrying the bomb- briefcase he found at Eduard's. \nBIZZLEBEK -- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details. (Kafka doesn't take that cue) -- To see such determination is reward enough for me. \nKAFKA The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth -- \nA BIRD rapidly swoops down from a tree, zipping past Kafka's head with a shrieking SQUAWK! \nKAFKA (gulp) -- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family. \nBIZZLEBEK There is one thing I'd like you to tell me. \nKAFKA I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point. \nBIZZLEBEK What made you think I'd be able to get you into the Castle? \nKAFKA The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something. (stops again, concerned) Isn't there? \nBIZZLEBEK In a manner of speaking. \nCUT: \nHIGHER GROUND - NIGHT \nSUDDENLY fingers spear through the bars of another cell to touch Kafka!  A GAUNT MAN inside. \nGAUNT MAN You've killed him!  Like a dog! \nKafka dropped his lantern in surprise, and shrinks back, CRUNCHING glass. \nGAUNT MAN -- They won't like that.  Not a bit! \nKAFKA I didn't -- \nThe inhabitants of the other cells start RATTLING their bars and beseeching Kafka.  He looks around, bewildered and horrified.  Hideous faces looking back at him. \nGAUNT MAN You'll incriminate the rest of us! Let me out too! \nShuddering, Kafka is moving away, making it through the shocking gauntlet, toward the door at the other end. \nHORRIBLE VOICES Help us! -- release us! \nGAUNT MAN (yelling above the din) You're in the bowels now, my friend! You've thrown yourself in it now! \nA HAGGARD MAN who may have had his tongue cut out gestures desperately at a lever on the wall to unlock the cells. Kafka starts to tentatively reach for it -- when there's a sudden SHRIEK beside him.  He whirls to see, behind more bars, the raving, convoluted face of the creature that stalked him at his office (whose loose eye has now gone completely) -- BANGING violently against his door. \nGAUNT MAN Let me out -- I'm all right -- they haven't treated me yet!  We can go together! \nBut now the evil Mr. Pick appears at the end of the passage from which Kafka came -- a gun in his hand. \nMR. PICK You! \nKafka yanks the lever and runs away.  Mr. Pick FIRES after him, starting to chase -- but the prisoners are coming out of their cells -- coming for him. \nCUT: \nSPIRAL STONE STAIRWELL \nKafka runs upwards, around and around and around. \nANOTHER FLOOR \nHere is a part of the Castle Kafka can understand -- office workers toiling away.  Kafka walks past one long row of them, SCRIBES sitting at a single endless desk.  They look like students under examination, hunched over their writing, a virtual conveyor belt of paperwork. \nIn the center of this floor is an actual conveyor -- a chain pulley running slowly up and down, presumably throughout the entire Castle, through small holes in the floor and ceiling. There are little pockets on the chain which the clerks continually pluck papers out of and slip papers into. \nThe ink bottle of one of the scribes runs dry.  He takes it over to a sink with three taps -- Hot, Cold -- and the third one he turns -- Ink. \nCUT: \nCORRIDOR \nKafka passes a FRIENDLY CLERK. \nFRIENDLY CLERK Are you lost? \nKafka nearly laughs at the enormity of the question. \nKAFKA I'm, uh, looking for the Medical Records Section. \nPause. \nFRIENDLY CLERK Oh, you're miles away.  From here you'll want to go left, left again, right, right again, left then right, right then left, and take the Blue Staircase. \nKAFKA Thank you. \nFRIENDLY CLERK (going on his way) -- I haven't seen you here before. \nKAFKA No ... \nKAFKA \nHe stands there, a man in a suit with a briefcase in an antiseptic corridor. \nSomeone else is sitting in darkness behind a huge desk (MURNAU).  His hand holds out a small vial.  The Laughing Man grabs it and leaves, gulping down its contents voraciously. \nMURNAU I assume you're wondering ... what all this has been about. \nKafka tries to see into the shadows. \nKAFKA Are you the Head of Medical Records? \nThe door behind Kafka opens again and an officious bureaucrat (EKMAN) comes in.  He sits in a chair and looks at Kafka. \nMURNAU (to Ekman) He's come on his own initiative. (to Kafka) -- Not something we encourage, mind you, but we like to know it exists. \nAnd he's stood up. \nMURNAU What it amounts to is simply this ... \nHe's coming around the desk.  He's drying his hands on a towel. \nMURNAU A piece of paper was delivered to the wrong clerk.  It was essential he bring it back to us.  These complications have arisen because he had friends -- like you, among others -- friends unlikely to let a sleeping dog lie. \nHe tosses the towel onto the desk.  Ekman looks irritated by this. \nKAFKA ... A piece of paper ... \nMURNAU A mere slip. (coming forward) Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came in, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct? \nHe places a fatherly hand on Kafka's shoulder. \nMURNAU (not quite in the light yet) Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one. \nKAFKA (again) ... A piece of paper ... \nMURNAU (face bending into the light) You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority. \nAnd he's an impressive, imposing figure of authority himself.  You'd probably trust him.  You'd certainly respect him.  But if you look into his eyes, he's frightening. \nCUT: \nUNDERGROUND CRYPTS \nMr. Pick runs from the crazed prisoners chasing him.  Fires his gun back at them, dropping one or two -- but then runs out of bullets. \nThe prisoners slowly surround him.  He backs away.  One of those chains that run throughout the Castle has its base here.  Mr. Pick keeps backing up, unavoidably, the deranged prisoners closing in -- until he falls backwards with a cry into the grinding wheels of the chain-system. \nCaught up in the chain, he's carried aloft with it, up to the ceiling.  The chain is the lifeline of the Castle and does not, could not, ever stop.  Instead it forces Mr. Pick to go along with it, his head CRACKING through the glass or wood \"manhole\" cover through which the chain passes. \nCUT: \nMURNAU'S OFFICE \nKafka tries not to flinch in the presence of this deadly figure. \nMURNAU -- You seem amused. \nKAFKA It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being. \nEkman sighs -- as if at a difficult child. \nMURNAU It's merely a matter of expediency.  It's imperative that my room to maneuver not be hindered by ... bureaucratic ramifications. \nEkman, who doesn't hear very well, directs one ear in particular back and forth between the other two.  Kafka just keeps looking at the charismatic man pacing around him -- who's now lighting an expensive cigarette of the kind that was in the ashtray at the lab. \nMURNAU -- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency. \nKAFKA (becoming clearer) \"Accident and Compensation\" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises. \nMURNAU (to Ekman) I believe we've exceeded his expectations. \nKAFKA (virtually to himself) I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see. (looks up) And I find you.  A body snatcher. \nKAFKA What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann? \nMURNAU As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her. \nHe's concocting another potion now, pouring an acidic-looking liquid from one container to another.  Kafka is looking increasingly worried. \nMURNAU And if not -- well, there are always what I call my caprices of vivisection. \nHe glances at the dangling animal parts.  And now, finished mixing his cocktail, he picks up some sort of suturing tool, pressing the trigger on it to start the end burning and SIZZLING. \nMURNAU Actually, if it weren't for the aberrant dilemma posed by someone like yourself -- continually asking for out-of-date files -- I'd probably give up my revisionist policies altogether. I'm sure what we have to do is start instead at the very inception -- with the embryo -- from a single cell even. (leers at Kafka) The lure of the Golem -- the man-made man.  You appreciate that, I know. \nEkman takes Kafka by the arm to lead him toward the operating table.  The Laughing Man moves in closer too, emitting a psychotic chortle. \nMURNAU To corrupt the image of man and then offer redemption ... This is the dawn, Kafka.  A new man is being born here.  A more resilient man ... A superman. \nKafka attempts an escape around the operating table, but the Laughing Man blocks his way and corrals him back to where he was before.  Dr. Murnau holds out the sinister aperitif for Kafka to take and drink in toast. \nMURNAU To a new world -- of Gods and monsters. \nThe glass comes closer and closer to Kafka's lips -- if he leans away from it any further he'll be lying on the operating table -- but now a WRENCHING noise makes everybody turn. \nThe body of Mr. Pick, bloody and ragged, is dragged up with a SMASH through a breaking floor-panel by the great chain. \nKafka has his chance.  The next time anyone looks at him he's holding the nozzle of the burning device under Ekman's throat, finger on the trigger. \n-- And on the other side of the laboratory a wide elevator platform rises into view -- carrying the prisoners from the dungeons! \nKAFKA \nThrows Ekman aside and runs away. \nEKMAN \nFalls to the floor, holding his hands up over his head with a SCREAM as the ghastly creatures from the depths converge on him -- but they pass him by -- intent on getting Murnau. \nThe last out of the elevator is the most horrible BEAST-MAN yet -- and we finally see the use to which various animal-parts have been put. \nMURNAU \nJust stands by the operating table, waiting for them.  He knows there's no way out and he's far too practical a man to waste energy running or screaming. \nCUT: \nDOORWAYS \nKafka running through the Castle, through door after door after door after door, leaving them all banging behind him, back and forth. \nCUT: \nTHE LABORATORY \nEkman stumbles to his feet, watching in horror as the prisoners of the Castle strap Murnau to his own operating table. \nOne by one, the prisoners file past the intricate surgical tools neatly laid out on white cloth.  Each prisoner selects the implement of his choice. \nEkman, too, runs away out of the laboratory. \nThe Laughing Man, snickering, isn't sure whose side he's on. But then, LAUGHTER BUILDING, he goes to join the others in line. \nCUT: \nDOORWAYS \nKafka still running in the maze -- through a final door.  And he finds himself right back in -- \nTHE LIBRARY \nWith the brightness of the laboratory facing him through its open door.  Horrible SOUNDS coming from in there. \nCASTLE GATES - DAWN \nOpening.  The police Inspector enters the main courtyard. Behind him come the two secondary policemen.  Behind them, obscurely, a few more. \nCASTLE COURTYARD \nHe and his men pause, reacting ... \n... as the few wretched survivors of the Castle prison stagger out of the shadows to greet them. \nCUT: \nEMBANKMENT - MORNING \nOn the Old Town side of the River.  Foggy. \nKAFKA \nWalks slowly, tiredly.  He looks up at the sky, but the sky is a silver shield against anyone who looks for help from it. \nFURTHER ON \nKafka stops.  Turns.  Did he hear something other than the wind and the water? \nFURTHER ON \nHe passes through a small park, approaching a gate on the other side of it.  Leaves RUSTLING.  Mist swirling around him.  He opens the gate and -- BOO! \nGABRIELA \nStanding there, half in shadow, in profile.  Her glorious profile. \nKAFKA Gabriela! -- you did get away. \nGABRIELA I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did. \nKAFKA -- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over. \nGABRIELA (her eye glancing far away) Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit. \nKafka is beginning to sense something quite wrong with her. \nKAFKA Gabriela ...? \nGABRIELA Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss. (looks at him) It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure. \nKafka just watches her ... The breeze sings in the air. \nGABRIELA Have you ever watched a person deteriorate?  Day by day.  I don't mean in a spiritual sense. \nKafka doesn't answer.  She turns fully to him.  The other side of her beautiful face is ... fungus.  Alive.  Seething. Frothing.  Bubbling.  Kafka backs away a couple of steps. \nGABRIELA Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that. \nKAFKA I -- I found your jailer. \nGABRIELA This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment. \nKAFKA They're dead now.  We can get help. \nGABRIELA I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others. \nKAFKA There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected. \nGABRIELA I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way. \nKAFKA I told you, they're dead.  It's finished. \nGABRIELA Why should I believe a man who never believed me?  They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way. \n", "test1_input": "CHARLIE CHAPLIN - EVENING \nBeing chased around a table by a big bearded man in flickering black-and-white. \nAN AUDIENCE \nWatching, laughing.  A great sea of grinning teeth and teary eyes. \nExcept one.  Kafka sits grimly alone near the back.  But suddenly he's not alone -- the Bearded Anarchist has sat down in front of him -- and now turns round, startlingly. \nBEARDED ANARCHIST We have another theory. \nAnd the Pockmarked Anarchist is suddenly sitting beside him. \nPOCKMARKED ANARCHIST We may have attached too little importance to the reason Eduard was summoned to the Castle to begin with. \nAnd the Youthful Anarchist is behind him, thrusting his head suddenly forward. \nYOUTHFUL ANARCHIST -- To correct a small discrepancy, you may recall. \nThe Solemn Anarchist is on Kafka's other side -- but he just watches the movie. \nPOCKMARKED ANARCHIST -- Ah, but what if it wasn't? \nBEARDED ANARCHIST -- Small. \nYOUTHFUL ANARCHIST -- What if it was a large discrepancy? \nKafka's head keeps turning around as they speak. \nPOCKMARKED ANARCHIST Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake. \nBEARDED ANARCHIST Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced. \nYOUTHFUL ANARCHIST -- Or he was even more an innocent victim than that -- he was chosen to bear the blame if the crime was uncovered by anyone else. \nPOCKMARKED ANARCHIST -- The crime so scandalous that the poor young clerk committed suicide rather than own up to it. \nKAFKA That's mad. \nPOCKMARKED ANARCHIST -- Oh, yes, it's mad. \nThe Solemn Anarchist suddenly laughs -- probably at Charlie Chaplin. \nKAFKA -- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young clerk could find himself in such a fix. \nPOCKMARKED ANARCHIST (sarcastic grunt) When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ... \nBEARDED ANARCHIST We have to know what he was working on at the time of his death. \nKAFKA He worked on routine claims.  His visit to the Castle was probably as minor a mission as he said it was. \nPOCKMARKED ANARCHIST Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty. \nKAFKA Then why haven't I been -- \nYOUTHFUL ANARCHIST -- Kidnapped or murdered?  Because your connection with Eduard was obvious and above board -- not as easily misconstrued. \nBEARDED ANARCHIST -- Not secretive, therefore not suspicious. \nPOCKMARKED ANARCHIST -- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel. \nKAFKA (head turning, exasperated) Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of this group.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to yourselves! \nPOCKMARKED ANARCHIST The loyal civil servant.  I suppose you'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy. \nBEARDED ANARCHIST It wouldn't surprise us if the discrepancy was between medicines sent and medicines received. \nYOUTHFUL ANARCHIST -- People die for such discrepancies. \n", "test1_true": "SOLEMN ANARCHIST (the hoarse voice of the restaurant bomber) We must have a look at Eduard's file. \ncut: \nSTORAGE SECTION - DAY \nKafka follows the KEEPER OF THE FILES along labyrinthine alleys between shelves packed with files.  Walls are obscured by columns of documents tied together, piled on top of each other.  There's Hardly room to move.  Stacks of files are everywhere, balancing precariously, even falling from time to time, from sheer Pressure in all directions. \nKEEPER (vexed) \"Raban\" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet. \nKAFKA It usually is. \nKEEPER (snaps at him) I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time. \nThey turn down another row, walking further, turning again. Kafka keeps flinching as thick bundles of documents CRASH down around him, narrowly missing him. \nKEEPER (oblivious to the danger) I'm overworked as it is. (finds the right section) \"Raban\" did you say? \nKAFKA Yes.  Isn't it there? \nThe Keeper of the Files is rifling through folders -- causing others to fall out onto Kafka who tries to catch them. \nKEEPER (pauses) Wait a minute.  \"Raban?\"  Where have I heard that name? \nKAFKA He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department \nThe Keeper of the files looks extremely displeased.  He pushes past Kafka, going back the way they've come. \nKAFKA (follows anxiously) What's the matter? \nKEEPER Why would we keep files on dead employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records? \nKAFKA (dodges another paper landslide) It's gone out so quickly? \nKEEPER Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off. \nKAFKA -- You mean my Chief has it. \nDocuments come crashing down and we can't see Kafka and the Keeper anymore. \nCUT: \nTHE CHIEF CLERK - DAY \nLooks up from his desk and sticks his chin out, which is his way of asking Kafka what the hell he wants.  Kafka dares to come in. \nKAFKA Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file. \nCHIEF CLERK I do. \nKAFKA I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them. \nThe Chief Clerk has little time for such sentimentality.  He gives Kafka a little exasperated look before reaching down to -- a right hand desk drawer -- which Kafka notices -- and taking out a folder. \nCHIEF CLERK No -- just as I thought -- no entry for family. \nKafka nods a bit, wondering what to do now. \nCHIEF CLERK Was there something else? \nKAFKA No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs. \nCHIEF CLERK (putting file away again) No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow. \nKAFKA (as ingenuously as possible) I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then. \nCHIEF CLERK (looks up) The Orlac claim. \nKAFKA Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir. \n", "test1_id": 1617, "test2_input": "On the outskirts of the city, beyond the Castle. \nMr. Pick and the Strange Man approach.  Some distance behind them, Kafka takes cover behind a tree, watching. \nMr. Pick leads the Strange Man down the central quarry to where a third man, a LABORER by the look of him, is waiting. \nKafka finds a vantage point somewhere above the central quarry.  He flattens himself on the ground and peers over the edge. \nIn the quarry, Mr. Pick steps back a pace from the Strange Man as they meet up with the Laborer and suddenly grabs the Strange Man, pinning his arms behind him, baring his chest or the Laborer to stab a dagger into! \nKafka is shocked by the abruptness of this.  He sees the Strange Man slump to the ground.  He crawls a little closer. He sees the Laborer replace the knife in its sheath on his belt, then help Mr. Pick drag the Strange Man off to some side shadows where they dump him. \nKafka strains forward a little, trying to make out their faces -- and the ground gives way! \nMR. PICK AND THE LABORER \nSpin around at the noise. \nKAFKA \nLands at the bottom of the incline, dazed.  He's still quite far away from the other end of the quarry where they are. \nMR. PICK AND THE LABORER \nLook at each other once -- then go after the intruder. \nKAFKA \nSees them coming.  Scrambles to his feet.  It takes him a split second to establish his options.  Namely, the best route is back up the way he came.  If only he can get up it again as fast. \nMr. Pick and the Laborer start to run. \nKafka starts to climb.  The incline is steep.  The gravel is loose.  He slips back down. \nMr. Pick and the Laborer are gaining speed. \nKafka digs his fingers into the dirt, pulling himself up with all his might, even though his shoes don't sustain holds. \nMr. Pick is a better runner than the burly Laborer.  He's almost there. \nKafka slips back down again.  Mr. Pick could almost grab him -- but Kafka literally throws himself up the slope again, gasping -- and Mr. Pick stretches but can't reach that far and Kafka's nearly at the top again -- Mr. Pick climbing after him now -- and Kafka's arm comes over the edge, he struggles over, kicking gravel back down in Mr. Pick's face. Mr. Pick slides back down to the bottom -- and Kafka's gone. \nThe Laborer fell over Mr. Pick as he came crashing back down, now Mr. Pick pushes him off in one direction while he goes another. \nCUT: \nSLOPING STREET \nEscaping back into the Old Quarter, Kafka runs downhill.  But even the momentum doesn't carry him as fast as he'd like. \nSMALL SQUARE \nA number of streets branching off.  Kafka sees Mr. Pick coming down one of them -- and the Laborer coming down another.  Kafka runs off along a third. \nCIRCUITOUS PASSAGE \nKafka runs.  Looks behind him.  Mr. Pick is coming.  He runs faster, under a weird archway.  Looks behind him.  Mr. Pick and the Laborer are coming.  Kafka darts down a side street. \nSIDE STREET \nAnother twisting little road.  He winds around one corner only to be met by another, the end of this street impossible to determine. \nBEHIND HIM \nMr. Pick and the Laborer are catching up. \nKAFKA \nTurns another corner and finds himself at the bottom of an incredibly long flight of steps.  A staired street.  On and on and on.  He doesn't know if he can make it. \n", "test2_true": "Come around -- look at the steps -- look at each other.  They take deep breaths and start up. \nTHE TOP \nHere they come, huffing and puffing. \nTHE BOTTOM \nKafka comes out from behind an extravagantly designed iron gate grillwork.  He sneaks away, back the way he came. \nCUT: \nTHE CENTRAL QUARRY \nThe body of the Strange Man lies face down where it was dropped. \nKafka walks toward it, looking around nervously in case anyone's coming.  Someone is.  When he gets to the corpse he hears the sound of an approaching WAGON.  He crouches quickly by the body to do what he's come here to do -- turn it over to look at -- \nTHE FACE \nOf a monster.  Horribly disfigured, scarred and stitched. And it isn't the kind of patchwork mess caused by acid or accident.  There seems to be design behind it.  Human design.  And beneath all this warped, mutilated flesh, almost unrecognizable ... the features of the vagrant snatched from the River. \nKAFKA'S FACE \nRevulsion.  He goes. \nTHE WAGON \nParks above the quarry.  The evil-looking Driver jumps down and pulls a large sack off the back.  He starts down into the quarry. \nKAFKA \nAppears over another edge.  He looks over at the wagon.  He sees that now the back is loaded up, and covered by a sheet of tarpaulin. \nCUT: \nTHE ANARCHISTS' ATTIC - NIGHT \nAll the bodies are gone.  Even the floorboards and pieces of furniture that might have had blood stains on them have been torn away and removed.  Kafka stands alone. \nCUT: \nTHE CITY - NIGHT \nAn eerie moon shines over the Castle. \nKAFKA'S HOUSE \nHe comes in.  Before taking off his coat, he finds in a pocket Inspector Grubach's card.  But what can he do again without evidence?  He puts the card back in the pocket. \nCUT: \nKAFKA'S DESK - BEFORE DAWN \nHe sits writing into the night in his little room under a low ceiling. \nKAFKA'S VOICE \"-- oh, and thank you for the suit from Father, although I don't know why he didn't simply return it.  If it's too small for him why do you immediately suppose it will fit me? ... Your son ... Your loving son ... Your somewhat loving son ... Your occasionally loving son ... Your incapable-of-loving son ... Your absolutely-bored-to-death-with-any- kind-of-family-life son ...\" \nThe BARKING of a DOG outside distracts him.  He stands up to stretch by his open window -- and we SEE that he's wearing a suit that's far too big for him, sleeves overhanging his skinny arms and  ands, trouser bottoms drowning his shoes. He looks out at the sky which is turning blue. \nTHE BRIDGE \nTwo men walk across the river. \nA WAGON \nRolls along one of the moribund streets of the Old Town.  The Driver swivels in his seat, looking over his wide shoulder, as if to see if he's being followed.  The glint in his eye suggests Evil. \nKAFKA'S ROOM \n", "test2_id": 1618, "test3_input": "Kafka puts a stamp on his letter, then adds it to the stack of obsessive correspondence already piled on one corner of his desk. \nCUT: \nTHE OFFICE - EVENING \nWith an ink-pad stamp, Kafka POUNDS the date onto a succession of documents. \nTHE OFFICE CLOCK \nStrikes six. \nTHE ASSISTANTS \nJump in unison when the BELL goes off.  Then in their hurry to leave start shoving all their papers and whatnots haphazardly into various drawers, opening and slamming them regardless of whether or not the contents are fully inside, resulting in a lot of crumpled documents and snapped pencils. \nBURGEL \nSuddenly hovering by Kafka's side, handing him something. \nBURGEL The Chief Clerk would like this ready for tomorrow morning. (oily) He says it should only take you an extra hour or two. \nCUT: \nTHE OFFICE - NIGHT \nDead silence after the daily racket of typewriters and telephones and adding machines.  Kafka works alone in the utterly deserted office building. \nHe looks out the window and sees a POLICEMAN walking by on the street below.  He thinks again about going to the law -- but goes back to work. \nHe hears a SOUND.  He looks around.  A sort of a SCRATCHING sound.  It's coming from the other end of the office somewhere.  Maybe the bathroom. \nKafka walks slowly back there.  At the bathroom door he pauses momentarily, then turns the handle to go inside. \nBATHROOM \nSCRATCH, SCRATCH.  Kafka looks for the source of the sound -- and in sudden startled shock instantly finds it -- where a huge arm has just been thrust through a small, high window -- and the ugly hand at the end of the arm is feeling around for the window-latch. \nKafka starts backing away -- as the hand flips open the latch -- and now the window, swinging open with a bang, and the rest of the intruder starts coming into view -- out before all of him appears Kafka has run out and slammed the door behind him. \nOFFICE \nKafka pulls a desk across the bathroom doorway. \nBATHROOM \nThe MANIAC -- because that's what his posture and breathing, seen from the back, suggest -- lurches into the bathroom from the window. \nOFFICE \nKafka grabs his coat -- and an umbrella off a rack.  He looks back at the bathroom -- the desk rocking back and forth as the intruder behind the door pushes.  Kafka runs away. \nHALLWAY \nHe runs to the elevator, sliding open the gate. \nOFFICE \nCRASH!  The desk tips over as the bathroom door is forced open. \nELEVATOR \nKafka descending.  The elevator cranking slowly downwards. Then, nearing the ground floor, it slows down even further. Then it suddenly stops dead.  Kafka reaches for the walls to steady himself.  He looks through the gate, assessing the distance to the ground floor below.  He tries the gate but it won't open. \nKAFKA (calls down there) -- Help!  HELP! \nHe looks around the tiny space of the elevator.  The roof hatch.  He reaches up, pushes it open, starts to climb up -- and YAAHH! -- the Maniac's face appears in the opening!  It's another monster face -- this one even worse than the one Kafka uncovered at the quarries.  A groaning, drooling, misshapen lump of wrinkled tissue.  And its owner's arms now come through to stretch after Kafka. \nKafka beats them back with the umbrella while still trying to pull the unyielding gate open.  The Maniac yelps as Kafka bashes the umbrella up at him, dodging his head out of the way each time the umbrella sweeps back at him, swinging his thick arms wildly to ward off blows and try and snatch the umbrella for himself.  He finally retreats under the barrage of blows and Kafka quickly takes the opportunity to lever open the gate with the umbrella. \n", "test3_true": "THE MANIAC \nLunges forward from above, scooping both arms down in a vain attempt to catch Kafka just as he drops out of sight -- landing on the ground floor with a roll. \nThe Maniac HOWLS at his failure, his features even more horribly contorted, Practically filling the small opening of the roof hatch as he SHRIEKS.  And as his atrocious face comes CLOSER and CLOSER and CLOSER -- one of his eyeballs falls out! -- POP! -- out of the socket suddenly -- dangling into the elevator, hanging by a single sinewy bloody thread. The Maniac cries out and reaches for the eyeball, bringing it back up to try and stuff back in place ... \nSTREET OUTSIDE \nKafka runs away from the office building, in horror, off into the night. \nCUT: \nKAFKA'S STREET - NIGHT \nHe stands at a corner, looking at his own house, scared even to go home.  But everything seems normal.  He starts walking there.  But when he reaches his front door: \nVOICE Did you think you'd be safe back in your little burrow? \nKafka turns.  One of the Assistants stands next to him. \nOTHER VOICE No matter how deep a hole you dig for yourself, the beast will always find you. \nKafka turns the other way.  The other Assistant is on his other side.  Kafka looks between the two of them. \nOSKAR We're to take you to the Castle. \nKafka might have expected this. \nKAFKA So.  You're the guides up there. And we thought it was Burgel. \nOne of the Assistants draws a revolver.  The other chuckles. \nLUDWIG They wouldn't let Burgel into the Castle.  You should look upon this as a great favor. \nKafka starts walking the way a flick of the revolver indicates, the Assistants flanking him. \nKAFKA I don't want any favors from the Castle -- just my rights. \nLUDWIG We answer directly to Ekman, the Senior Partner -- he practically runs the Castle.  In a case like this you're better off dealing with the highest authority -- even though it's equally futile. \nOSKAR When you speak to him you have to lean quite near his right ear because the left doesn't work so well. \nAROUND THE CORNER \nThey head up in the direction of the Castle. \nKAFKA For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors. \nOSKAR -- Just doing our job. \nKAFKA It's a farce. \nLUDWIG We think you'd better accept your position instead of pointlessly annoying us. \nKAFKA What position?  Being prosecuted in a case like this means having already lost it. \nOSKAR Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings. \nKAFKA Close only by virtue of antithesis. \nOne of the Assistants keeps making a show of wiping his brow, though it's by no means hot. \nANOTHER STREET \nKafka walks stiffly between the Assistants, the three of them almost locked together as one unit, like lifeless matter. \nKAFKA (shaking his head) My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything. \nOSKAR (laughs) It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects. \n", "test3_id": 1619}

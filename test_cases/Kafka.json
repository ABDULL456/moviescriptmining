{"test1_input": "MARGARETE Don't worry about your friend -- I'm sure he'll turn up. \nERNST (a parting word) What are you working on, Kafka? \nKAFKA I'm writing a story about a man who wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a giant insect. \nHis friends glance at each other surreptitiously and don't know what to say -- other than goodnight \nKAFKA \nTurns to go -- when he notices Bizzlebek leaning listlessly in the coffee house doorway.  A figure in the shadows. \nBIZZLEBEK I've read your stories.  They're fantastic. \nKAFKA (not sure if he believes him) I don't know what you could have read. \nBIZZLEBEK Just what you've published. \nKAFKA -- In magazines nobody reads. \nBIZZLEBEK I read the one about the penal colony. \nKAFKA (cautious) Did you? \nBIZZLEBEK The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man. (looks impressed) Very good. \nKafka suspects he's being mocked.  But perhaps not. Bizzlebek steps out, buttoning his coat. \nBIZZLEBEK If I could sculpt as well as that, I'd be quite proud of myself. \nHe's already quite proud of himself -- tossing his scarf over his shoulder with a flourish -- and striding off into the night. \nCUT: \nTHE CASTLE - NIGHT \nSeen from just below, from the ancient cemetery that borders its high, impregnable, imperial walls.  The all-seeing-eye of the city.  An awesome edifice. \nTHE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER \nKafka walking across from the Old Quarter toward the New Town. \nHe passes some working-class types who seem vaguely threatening.  Do they mutter some remark behind his back? \nCUT: \nALCHEMISTS' ROW - NIGHT \nA bizarre street.  Tiny little houses that look fashioned by a toymaker, all bunched tightly next to each other, forming a continuous rooftop of odd configurations and angles and pointed chimneys.  The street named after practitioners of the black arts and dark sciences who inhabited it in the Sixteenth Century. \nKafka's house is toward the back, a light shining from the single upper window.  Through it, Kafka is seen sitting at the only desk that really matters to him -- his writing one. \nKAFKA'S ROOM \nHe's struggling to get a sentence right -- rereading it to himself. \nKAFKA \"As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from disturbing dreams he ... from unsettling dreams ... uneasy dreams ... Gregor Samsa ... Gregor ...?\" (wondering) Carl.  George.  Rudolf ... \nSuddenly there's a loud KNOCK on the front door below. \nDOWNSTAIRS \nKafka opens the tiny front door of this almost-miniature little house.  Two intimidating MEN stand outside, one tall, one short, wearing similar black suits and grim expressions. \nCUT: \nANOTHER DOOR - NIGHT \nKafka tries to match the exacting pace of his two warders, flanking him as they walk him along a corridor, through another doorway. \n", "test1_true": "Kafka tugs his collar up a bit, his breath visible in the air.  He has a feeling what's going to be under the sheet on the lonely trolley in the middle of the room before the first man summons him over to it. \nKafka goes.  The first man yanks the sheet off the face in one quick movement.  The face of Eduard.  White and bloated, the tongue jutting, the eyes bulging. \nKafka recoils, stepping back instinctively. \nSECOND MAN (still behind Kafka at the door) You know him? \nKAFKA ... Yes. \nFIRST MAN His name is Eduard Raban? \nKAFKA ... Yes. \nAnd now he hears a stirring in a dark corner.  He looks up again. \nA third man steps out of the shadows where he's been quietly standing and walks over to Kafka.  He is a severe man, stolid, dedicated, and never smiles.  He reminds Kafka of his father. \nMAN (with an introductory nod) Inspector Grubach. \nCUT: \nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nThe Inspector behind his big desk.  Kafka in front of it. \nINSPECTOR Kafka -- is that your real name? \nKAFKA Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be? \nINSPECTOR When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban? \nKAFKA Wednesday.  We left the office together. \nINSPECTOR Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps? \nKAFKA No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house. \nINSPECTOR (consulting papers) Your office is the Workmen's -- \nKAFKA -- Accident and Compensation Association. \nINSPECTOR Where you've been employed for seven years. \nKAFKA Eight -- and seven months. \nINSPECTOR Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth. \nKAFKA Well -- other departments are, yes. \nINSPECTOR Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close? \nKAFKA Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends. (pause) How was Eduard ... \nINSPECTOR He was found in the River.  Could he swim? \nKAFKA I don't know. \nINSPECTOR Was he depressed? \nKAFKA No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself? \nINSPECTOR Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they? \nKAFKA No, I suppose not. \nINSPECTOR (closing the file) He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think. \nKAFKA (as the interview seems to be over) Can I ask -- how you found me? \n", "test1_id": 1617, "test2_input": "On the outskirts of the city, beyond the Castle. \nMr. Pick and the Strange Man approach.  Some distance behind them, Kafka takes cover behind a tree, watching. \nMr. Pick leads the Strange Man down the central quarry to where a third man, a LABORER by the look of him, is waiting. \nKafka finds a vantage point somewhere above the central quarry.  He flattens himself on the ground and peers over the edge. \nIn the quarry, Mr. Pick steps back a pace from the Strange Man as they meet up with the Laborer and suddenly grabs the Strange Man, pinning his arms behind him, baring his chest or the Laborer to stab a dagger into! \nKafka is shocked by the abruptness of this.  He sees the Strange Man slump to the ground.  He crawls a little closer. He sees the Laborer replace the knife in its sheath on his belt, then help Mr. Pick drag the Strange Man off to some side shadows where they dump him. \nKafka strains forward a little, trying to make out their faces -- and the ground gives way! \nMR. PICK AND THE LABORER \nSpin around at the noise. \nKAFKA \nLands at the bottom of the incline, dazed.  He's still quite far away from the other end of the quarry where they are. \nMR. PICK AND THE LABORER \nLook at each other once -- then go after the intruder. \nKAFKA \nSees them coming.  Scrambles to his feet.  It takes him a split second to establish his options.  Namely, the best route is back up the way he came.  If only he can get up it again as fast. \nMr. Pick and the Laborer start to run. \nKafka starts to climb.  The incline is steep.  The gravel is loose.  He slips back down. \nMr. Pick and the Laborer are gaining speed. \nKafka digs his fingers into the dirt, pulling himself up with all his might, even though his shoes don't sustain holds. \nMr. Pick is a better runner than the burly Laborer.  He's almost there. \nKafka slips back down again.  Mr. Pick could almost grab him -- but Kafka literally throws himself up the slope again, gasping -- and Mr. Pick stretches but can't reach that far and Kafka's nearly at the top again -- Mr. Pick climbing after him now -- and Kafka's arm comes over the edge, he struggles over, kicking gravel back down in Mr. Pick's face. Mr. Pick slides back down to the bottom -- and Kafka's gone. \nThe Laborer fell over Mr. Pick as he came crashing back down, now Mr. Pick pushes him off in one direction while he goes another. \nCUT: \nSLOPING STREET \nEscaping back into the Old Quarter, Kafka runs downhill.  But even the momentum doesn't carry him as fast as he'd like. \nSMALL SQUARE \nA number of streets branching off.  Kafka sees Mr. Pick coming down one of them -- and the Laborer coming down another.  Kafka runs off along a third. \nCIRCUITOUS PASSAGE \nKafka runs.  Looks behind him.  Mr. Pick is coming.  He runs faster, under a weird archway.  Looks behind him.  Mr. Pick and the Laborer are coming.  Kafka darts down a side street. \nSIDE STREET \nAnother twisting little road.  He winds around one corner only to be met by another, the end of this street impossible to determine. \nBEHIND HIM \nMr. Pick and the Laborer are catching up. \nKAFKA \nTurns another corner and finds himself at the bottom of an incredibly long flight of steps.  A staired street.  On and on and on.  He doesn't know if he can make it. \n", "test2_true": "Come around -- look at the steps -- look at each other.  They take deep breaths and start up. \nTHE TOP \nHere they come, huffing and puffing. \nTHE BOTTOM \nKafka comes out from behind an extravagantly designed iron gate grillwork.  He sneaks away, back the way he came. \nCUT: \nTHE CENTRAL QUARRY \nThe body of the Strange Man lies face down where it was dropped. \nKafka walks toward it, looking around nervously in case anyone's coming.  Someone is.  When he gets to the corpse he hears the sound of an approaching WAGON.  He crouches quickly by the body to do what he's come here to do -- turn it over to look at -- \nTHE FACE \nOf a monster.  Horribly disfigured, scarred and stitched. And it isn't the kind of patchwork mess caused by acid or accident.  There seems to be design behind it.  Human design.  And beneath all this warped, mutilated flesh, almost unrecognizable ... the features of the vagrant snatched from the River. \nKAFKA'S FACE \nRevulsion.  He goes. \nTHE WAGON \nParks above the quarry.  The evil-looking Driver jumps down and pulls a large sack off the back.  He starts down into the quarry. \nKAFKA \nAppears over another edge.  He looks over at the wagon.  He sees that now the back is loaded up, and covered by a sheet of tarpaulin. \nCUT: \nTHE ANARCHISTS' ATTIC - NIGHT \nAll the bodies are gone.  Even the floorboards and pieces of furniture that might have had blood stains on them have been torn away and removed.  Kafka stands alone. \nCUT: \nTHE CITY - NIGHT \nAn eerie moon shines over the Castle. \nKAFKA'S HOUSE \nHe comes in.  Before taking off his coat, he finds in a pocket Inspector Grubach's card.  But what can he do again without evidence?  He puts the card back in the pocket. \nCUT: \nKAFKA'S DESK - BEFORE DAWN \nHe sits writing into the night in his little room under a low ceiling. \nKAFKA'S VOICE \"-- oh, and thank you for the suit from Father, although I don't know why he didn't simply return it.  If it's too small for him why do you immediately suppose it will fit me? ... Your son ... Your loving son ... Your somewhat loving son ... Your occasionally loving son ... Your incapable-of-loving son ... Your absolutely-bored-to-death-with-any- kind-of-family-life son ...\" \nThe BARKING of a DOG outside distracts him.  He stands up to stretch by his open window -- and we SEE that he's wearing a suit that's far too big for him, sleeves overhanging his skinny arms and  ands, trouser bottoms drowning his shoes. He looks out at the sky which is turning blue. \nTHE BRIDGE \nTwo men walk across the river. \nA WAGON \nRolls along one of the moribund streets of the Old Town.  The Driver swivels in his seat, looking over his wide shoulder, as if to see if he's being followed.  The glint in his eye suggests Evil. \nKAFKA'S ROOM \n", "test2_id": 1618, "test3_input": "Someone else is sitting in darkness behind a huge desk (MURNAU).  His hand holds out a small vial.  The Laughing Man grabs it and leaves, gulping down its contents voraciously. \nMURNAU I assume you're wondering ... what all this has been about. \nKafka tries to see into the shadows. \nKAFKA Are you the Head of Medical Records? \nThe door behind Kafka opens again and an officious bureaucrat (EKMAN) comes in.  He sits in a chair and looks at Kafka. \nMURNAU (to Ekman) He's come on his own initiative. (to Kafka) -- Not something we encourage, mind you, but we like to know it exists. \nAnd he's stood up. \nMURNAU What it amounts to is simply this ... \nHe's coming around the desk.  He's drying his hands on a towel. \nMURNAU A piece of paper was delivered to the wrong clerk.  It was essential he bring it back to us.  These complications have arisen because he had friends -- like you, among others -- friends unlikely to let a sleeping dog lie. \nHe tosses the towel onto the desk.  Ekman looks irritated by this. \nKAFKA ... A piece of paper ... \nMURNAU A mere slip. (coming forward) Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came in, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct? \nHe places a fatherly hand on Kafka's shoulder. \nMURNAU (not quite in the light yet) Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one. \nKAFKA (again) ... A piece of paper ... \nMURNAU (face bending into the light) You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority. \nAnd he's an impressive, imposing figure of authority himself.  You'd probably trust him.  You'd certainly respect him.  But if you look into his eyes, he's frightening. \nCUT: \nUNDERGROUND CRYPTS \nMr. Pick runs from the crazed prisoners chasing him.  Fires his gun back at them, dropping one or two -- but then runs out of bullets. \nThe prisoners slowly surround him.  He backs away.  One of those chains that run throughout the Castle has its base here.  Mr. Pick keeps backing up, unavoidably, the deranged prisoners closing in -- until he falls backwards with a cry into the grinding wheels of the chain-system. \nCaught up in the chain, he's carried aloft with it, up to the ceiling.  The chain is the lifeline of the Castle and does not, could not, ever stop.  Instead it forces Mr. Pick to go along with it, his head CRACKING through the glass or wood \"manhole\" cover through which the chain passes. \nCUT: \nMURNAU'S OFFICE \nKafka tries not to flinch in the presence of this deadly figure. \nMURNAU -- You seem amused. \nKAFKA It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being. \nEkman sighs -- as if at a difficult child. \nMURNAU It's merely a matter of expediency.  It's imperative that my room to maneuver not be hindered by ... bureaucratic ramifications. \nEkman, who doesn't hear very well, directs one ear in particular back and forth between the other two.  Kafka just keeps looking at the charismatic man pacing around him -- who's now lighting an expensive cigarette of the kind that was in the ashtray at the lab. \nMURNAU -- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency. \nKAFKA (becoming clearer) \"Accident and Compensation\" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises. \nMURNAU (to Ekman) I believe we've exceeded his expectations. \nKAFKA (virtually to himself) I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see. (looks up) And I find you.  A body snatcher. \n", "test3_true": "MURNAU Life is more than a Chinese puzzle, my friend. \nCUT: \nFLOOR OF CLERKS \nUniformly, like a chorus line, the infinite row of clerks turn their heads from their single endless desk when they hear an awful NOISE: \nMr. Pick is breaking through from the floor below.  The inexorably rising chain has hauled him floor by floor through the Castle, breaking open holes too small for his body, shredding him along the way, and still carrying him upwards \nCUT: \nCASTLE CORRIDOR \nKafka walks along with Murnau and Ekman.  The Laughing Man holds Kafka's arm. \nKAFKA And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends. \nMURNAU Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious. \nThey pass another of those grinding chains carrying memos and inter-office directives up and down. \nMURNAU But you're quite right that he didn't die in that cave-in. In fact, he didn't die at all. He was simply recalled -- by himself.  As well as being Head of Medical Records here and a Director of your firm -- I'm Dr. Murnau, of course. \nThe Laughing Man giggles crazily. \nLIBRARY \nThe Laughing Man, subdued for a moment, merely smiles a little, opening the door to let Kafka in first, guarding him close.  Dr. Murnau then leads the way across to his laboratory door. \nMURNAU May I ask where your two warders are? \nKAFKA Lying in the gutter where they belong. \nMurnau laughs, but then has to stop as it encourages the Laughing Man, bringing forth a mad chuckle or two from him. \nMURNAU Pity.  They're an amusing pair, didn't you find?  Absolute innocents. \nHe pushes the tall door open into his lab. \nLABORATORY \nMurnau spreads his hands proudly as they enter, displaying his amazing factory. \nMURNAU I so rarely get the chance of showing my work to anybody -- anybody capable of appreciating it, that is.  You might say I'm a student of human reaction. \nEkman, who's seen it all before, goes to lean somewhere, bored. \nKAFKA The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you. \nMURNAU On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one. \nAs if in response to that the Laughing Man convulses anew. Ekman immediately turns to a shelf for another vial and goes to give it to the Laughing Man. \nMURNAU -- I can't very well administer experimental treatments to corpses -- and if they become corpses, why, they have their uses too -- that's why speed is essential.  Living tissue, even if its owner has passed on, is our most valuable acquisition. \nThe Laughing Man gulps down the potion and starts to calm down a little. \nMURNAU We've tried transfusions on our ... volunteers.  Unfortunately, far from infusing superior characteristics it's tended to make them insane -- murderous even -- a condition we've had occasion to make use of. \nTHE HIDDEN BOMB-CASE \nTICKING lightly away.  The clock inside the bomb-case, becoming visible as if by X-Ray, is SEEN to be a matter of minutes away from blast-off. \nTHE LAB \nMurnau walks to where the elaborate distillation processes are going on.  The very section where Kafka hid the bomb. Kafka wipes his brow, quickly, conscious of Ekman staring at him.  Murnau gazes obsessively at his contraptions, his piercing eyes following the routes of the flowing chemicals. \nMURNAU -- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either. \n", "test3_id": 1619}

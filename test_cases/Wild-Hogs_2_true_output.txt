DOUG (CONT'D) Yeah, I left that one on too long. Doug flips the stick and the marshmallow goes flying behind him. The guys don't notice - but we see the marshmallow land on the tent and continue to burn. Bob continues to huff on the air mattress. He stops and looks at it. 
BOB (out of breath) I think I'm half way there.

WOODY In just one hour. 
DOUG 
(TO BOB) You sure you don't want us to spread out a sleeping bag? We have three in the-- Doug turns around and sees a foot-wide flame now burning on the tent. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Shit! The tent-- Doug and the guys jump up and hurry over to the tent. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Dudley, get the water jug off my bike! Dudley hurries over to Doug's bike as Doug and Bob try to smother the flame with sand. 
DOUG (CONT'D) It should be okay. It's fire retardant. The guys try and extinguish the flame as Dudley comes running with a jug. He quickly takes off the cap. Doug notices him. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Dudley, no! That'sÂ— It's too late. Dudley is already throwing it on the fire. The liquid hits the tent and it explodes into flames. The guys shield themselves. 
DOUG (CONT'D) Gas! That's the spare gas tank, Dudley! Dudley doesn't know what to say. The fire quickly disentergrates the tent. Doug, Bob and Woody just watch, knowing there's nothing they can do. After a moment, DUDLEY runs back up with the correct water jug and empties it on what is now a flaming pile of ash. It does nothing. 
DUDLEY We need more water. 
DOUG That was all of it, Dudley. That was all the water we had.

DUDLEY Oh. Dudley takes this in for a moment. 
DUDLEY (CONT'D) Is anybody else thirsty? The guys just look at him. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. ROADSIDE US-50 -- THE NEXT MORNING 
BOB, DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY are all sleeping on Bob's air mattress, like four sardines. Doug opens his eyes to see a large figure standing at the foot of the air mattress. It's a stern-looking highway patrolman. 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN You guys all right? 
DOUG Yeah. Yeah, just on a road trip. 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN All right. Just making sure. 
(BEAT) Looks pretty comfortable, actually. We see the highway patrolman has started rubbing his thigh. Doug quickly jumps up, waking the others. 
DOUG Okay, well... Thanks for stopping. Have a nice day, officer. The highway patrolman laughs. 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN All right, I get it. 
(WINKS) Five's a crowd. Doug is mortified. The officer looks them over for a moment. 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONT'D) You guys are lucky to have each other. (looks at them hungrily) Damn lucky. 
"Wild Hogs" writers first draft 7/06/05 39. 
DUDLEY 
(OBLIVIOUS) That's what I always say. Dudley gets up and puts his arm around Doug. We see he's wearing a saggy pair of briefs and nothing else. 
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN Well... Have a good one. The patrolman walks off. Dudley looks at Doug and grins. 
DUDLEY Morning. 
DOUG Please put your pants on. 
EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT AFTERNOON 
The guys cruise through the rolling prairies of Missouri. It's another beautiful day. They ride in formation, until Woody's bandana doo-rag blows off. Woody goes back to get it. The other guys stop and wait for him to return. 
EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER 
The guys are still riding - but now the heat of the Missouri plains is taking it's toll. They look boiling, and have sweated through their clothes. Bob takes a drink of water from a bottle of water, then pours the water over his head. He breathes a sigh of relief, until he hears an angry yell behind him. He looks back and sees Woody is now drenched from the water. Bob smiles sheepishly as Woody burns.

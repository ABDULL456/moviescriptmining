{"test1_input": "Ruth looks closer at Letty. \nRUTH Have you been crying?    Your eyes are all puffy. \nLetty self-consciously touches her eyes. \nLETTY Things have been kind of stressful lately. \nRUTH But everything's OK? \nRuth is trying on a veil at this point. \nLETTY Yeah, everything's under control. \nRUTH What about the engagement party? \nLETTY Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery. \nRUTH Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it. \nLetty sighs, moves to the racks and pulls out a dress. \nLETTY You better start trying on before the vultures get all the good ones. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER R uth twirls around in a taffeta gown as Letty picks up discarded dresses from the floor and hangs them up. \nRUTH What about this one? \nLETTY (with sisterly pride) You look beautiful. \nRUTH Really? \nLETTY Truly. \nMartha Mayer is led in by the clerk. \nLETTY Hi, Mom. \nRUTH Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress. \nMRS. MAYER You look just wonderful, Ruthie. But I really think you should try on a few more, don't you? \nLetty and Ruth shoot each other a look of doom. \nINT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER \nA bedraggled Letty and her mother fight the crowds to look at dresses. They are bumped and jostled from all sides. \nMRS. MAYER Has Paul heard about his promotion? \nLETTY No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it. \nRuth comes out of the dressing room in another gown. \nMRS. MAYER I don't like the bias cut on that one. \nMrs. Mayer holds up an ornate dress. \nRUTH No more. I can't stand to try on one more dress. \nMRS. MAYER Letty, I think this would be beautiful on you. \nLETTY Oh no. \nMRS. MAYER Paul could pop the question at any time. \nLETTY Mom, please. \nMRS. MAYER Especially with a promotion in the offing. \nRUTH Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you. \nLETTY (to Ruth) Do you think I should? \nRUTH Yes, yes.    It'll be fun. \nLetty takes the gown and disappears into the dressing room. \nINT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER \nLetty emerges from the dressing room. \nLETTY Mom?   Mom? Ruth? \nLetty peers around the corner, becoming a tad frantic. But neither her mother nor Ruth is to be found. It's just Letty, resplendent in ecru satin. \nCLERK I think they went over to the next shop to take a peek at shoes. \nLetty pushes back her veil, sits down on the floor and takes a sip of her now-cold coffee. \n", "test1_true": "A \"House and Garden\" picture of elegance.

Letty opens the door to her mother, who does a quick reconnaissance of the room. \nMRS. MAYER I gather he's late as usual. \nLETTY (to her mother) Can I get you a glass of champagne? \nThe doorbell RINGS. Letty greets her father, a mid 50s business type, and his wife MONICA, a younger version of Letty's mother. \nLETTY Hi, Dad, Monica.   I'm so glad you could come. \nSuddenly, the parents are face-to-face, Letty standing between them. \nLETTY Mom, this is Monica.   Monica, my mother, Martha. \nThe two Mrs. Mayers make appropriate MURMURS. Letty's parents stare each other down. Ruth shifts from foot to foot. Silence falls in the room with a thump. \nLETTY Dad, Mother, you've met before, right? \nRuth takes a dramatic gulp of air. The evening hangs in the balance. Finally, \nMR. MAYER How've you been, Martha? \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - LATER \nMr. Mayer and Monica cozy up to each other on the love seat while Mrs. Mayer, Ruth and Paul sit on the opposite couch. \nLetty passes hors d'oeuvres, and Jake doles out napkins. \nLETTY It's mushroom-time, folks. \nMR. MAYER (biting into one) I like the touch of cilantro. It is cilantro, isn't it? \nLETTY You can always call it, Dad. M ONICA You must get your cooking skills from your father, Letty. \nUncomfortable silence falls on the party. Monica wipes the edge of Mr. Mayer's mouth with her napkin. \nLETTY Ruth's narrowed the dress hunt down to two, Dad. \nMR. MAYER Tell me about them. \nRUTH One's a silk... \nMRS. MAYER Not in front of Jake, Ruthie.    It's bad luck. \nRuth looks at Letty nervously. \nMONICA I remember how hard it was looking for my dress. I must have been to 100 stores. \nMrs. Mayer clears her throat.    More silence. \nLETTY You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate? \nPAUL Yes. \nMRS. MAYER That might be nice. \nMR. MAYER As long as you have... \nLETTY Puglia olives. Would I forget? (beat) A round of martinis coming right up. \nLetty leaves with Paul hot on her heels. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME \nLetty shakes the martinis while Paul gets out the glasses. Ruth enters the kitchen and sidles up to Letty. \nRUTH How can I help? \nLETTY Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it? \nRUTH What about the souffle?    Has that gone in? \nLETTY Yeah, I just put it in. But the squab, I think that needs to be basted. \nPaul hands Letty the olive bottle. \nPAUL (to Ruth) Kind of icy in there. \nRUTH (to Paul) Thank God we have alcohol. \nLetty skewers olives and puts them in the martinis. Bits of fleck rise from the olives, then swim to the tops of the glasses. \nLETTY Fuck me. \nRUTH What's the matter? \nLetty grabs the olive bottle. \n", "test1_id": 2412, "test2_input": "Letty sits on the floor.

M ICHAEL This must be Beast. \nLETTY That's Mr. Beast to you. \nMICHAEL How was your day? \nLETTY I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing. \nMICHAEL Sounds grim. \nLETTY Yeah.    How was the job search? \nMichael makes a thumbs-down gesture. \nLETTY Who ever said sanity was fun? \nMICHAEL It doesn't matter.    It'll work out. \nLETTY Promise? \nMICHAEL Promise. (beat) As long as we have steak. \nLETTY Steak? \nMICHAEL It's a well-known fact that a red- meat dinner can cure the blues. (beat) You and Beast wait here. I'll be back in a jiff. \nLetty gives Michael a tired smile. Michael jumps up and leaves. A moment passes. The door opens again. \nMICHAEL While I'm gone why don't you slip into something a little more naked? \nEXT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT \nMichael walks out of the grocery store, loaded down with bags. He carries a bottle of wine and a bunch of flowers. \nHe passes two ladies who gossip outside the store. \nLADY ONE I can't believe he did that. \nLADY TWO What a weirdo. \nMichael stops abruptly.   He turns back and looks at the women. They LAUGH. \nMichael starts toward the car. He hears more LAUGHTER from the women. He turns back and walks up to them. \nMICHAEL Don't ever talk about me again, you hear me? \nThe women pull back in fright. \nINT. KITCHEN - LETTY'S APARTMENT - LATER \nLetty, in a skimpy negligee, lights candles on the table. Michael enters with the groceries and wine. \nLETTY I thought maybe you got lost. \nMICHAEL The store was busy. \nLETTY You got wine. That's great. \nM \nMICHAEL Would you mind if we just called it an early night? \nLETTY You go ahead and relax. I'll cook. M ICHAEL I think I should go home. \nLETTY Are you OK? \nMICHAEL Big restaurant interview tomorrow. \nLETTY But what about the red meat-blues thing? \nMICHAEL You know, we've got that dinner with my parents tomorrow, too. I should really get some rest tonight. \nMichael gives Letty a kiss good night. He leaves. She stares after him. Reluctantly, she blows out the candles and starts putting the groceries away. \nLETTY (to Beast) How's filet sound? \nINT. RESTAURANT - DAY \nThe coffee shop hasn't opened for business yet. Michael and six people in their early 20s fill out applications. \n", "test2_true": "TWO OTHER APPLICANTS glance toward him.   Michael tries to write. He can't. \nMICHAEL (under his breath) No, no, no. Not now. No. \nThe other applicants look toward Michael and quickly avert their eyes. The RESTAURANT MANAGER walks up to the group. \nMichael grabs his briefcase and walks out of the restaurant. His application, incomplete, remains on the table. \nINT. KITCHEN - SANTUCCI HOUSE - NIGHT \nThis kitchen is the heart of the home--copper pots, two pasta makers and every size wooden spoon made. \nLetty, lightly dusted with flour, mixes fresh pasta with her hands. Mrs. Santucci peers into the bowl. \nMRS. SANTUCCI More water. It's too pasty. \nLetty pours in more water. \nLETTY I'll never Mget the hang of this. \nRS. SANTUCCI All the Santucci women go through this. \nLetty smiles at her and kneads harder.   Mr. Santucci enters and kisses his wife. \nMR. SANTUCCI Hi there, Letty. \nLETTY Hi, Frank. \nMr. Santucci looks in the pasta bowl. \nMR. SANTUCCI It needs more water. \nHe dumps some in.   Letty looks sadly at the gloppy mess. \nLETTY (to Mrs. Santucci) Maybe we should make lamb next week. \nMichael walks in. \nMRS. SANTUCCI Hi, Sweetheart. \nLETTY How'd it go? \nMichael takes his tie, holds it up like a noose and lets his tongue loll out of his mouth. \nLETTY What happened? \nMICHAEL Four interviews. Four no-gos. \nLETTY The restaurant, too? \nMICHAEL I couldn't even face that one. \nMr. and Mrs. Santucci look at each other. \nLETTY That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning. \nMICHAEL You don't have to take care of me, you know. \nAn uneasy silence falls in the room. \nMRS. SANTUCCI Maybe we should save the job talk for after dinner. \nMichael looks in the bowl of pasta dough that Letty continues to labor over. He reaches in to help with the mixing. \nMICHAEL (to Letty) Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap. \nLETTY I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap. \nINT. BATHROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMichael finishes brushing his teeth. He opens the medicine cabinet, pulls out a prescription bottle and pours a pill into his hand. \nLETTY (OS) You're going to miss the Top Ten. \nMICHAEL Coming. \nHe raises the pill to his mouth, then opens his hand and lets it drop in the sink. Michael runs the water and watches the pill swirl slowly down the drain. \nLETTY (OS) Michael, hurry. \nMichael stuffs the pill bottle in a bottom drawer.

But I've gotten better at pacing myself. \nJOHANSEN Are you sure? \nLETTY I'll call you if I have problems. Scout's honor. \nJOHANSEN I have to say I'm inclined to give it another try. \nLetty hugs Johansen. \nJOHANSEN But, Letty, why don't you give yourself three weeks to set it up this time? \nINT. MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nMichael sits in the same booth, eating a hamburger.   About half of the application is now completed. \nINT. TUXEDO SHOP - NIGHT \nLetty and her mother sit in silence.

MAYER I will, Dear. I promise. (beat) Why McDonald's? \nLETTY He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away. \nLetty looks toward the back of the store.    Her mother looks at her. Letty ignores her mother. \nMRS. MAYER I've read that lots of people my age are supplementing their incomes these days by working at McDonald's and Burger King. \nLetty looks at her mother, tries to read her. \nLETTY I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded. \nMRS. MAYER Don't be fresh. \nLETTY Just remember that I love him. \nMichael walks out of the dressing room and advances toward the two women, bowing in Cary Grant fashion as he nears. \nLetty's mother turns to her daughter, who beams brightly at the dashing Michael. \nMRS. MAYER (to Letty) I'll say this, Dear.   He looks damn good in a tuxedo. \nEXT. TRACK - DAY \nLetty and Michael jog. \nMICHAEL Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin? \nLETTY No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker. \nMICHAEL Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic? \nLETTY You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years. \nINT. CHURCH - DAY \nEvery inch of every pew in the Baroque church is stuffed with guests. Michael sits in the second row. He cranes his head around as \"Pachelbel's Canon\" RINGS OUT and the FLOWER GIRL L advances. \nLetty, in the first part of the bride's maids' procession, heads down the aisle next. The bride is nowhere in sight. \nBut even so, as soon as Michael spots Letty, he stands. Everyone else remains seated. They look at him. Michael doesn't notice.

MAYER Oh, and have you met Michael?    He's Letty's boyfriend. \nLetty and Ruth overhear this. They make eye contact.   Ruth raises her eyebrows toward Letty. Letty smiles back. \nINT.   BALLROOM - LATER \nRuth and Letty talk while Michael twirls across the dance floor with Monica. \nRUTH The worst was when I stammered Jake's name. \nLETTY I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect. \nRUTH That's thanks to all your help. \nCort, overweight and red from drink, approaches Ruth and Letty. \nLETTY Uh oh, Uncle Cort at 6 o'clock. \nRUTH Sorry to do this to you. But I am the bride. \nRuth turns and flees. CORT pounces on Letty and plants the wettest kiss ever on her mouth. \nCORT (to Letty) I don't think I've seen you in two or three years. \nLETTY Has it been that long? \nCORT You were with that lawyer. \nLETTY I'm dating Michael now. \nCORT Met him in the receiving line.

M ICHAEL In the restaurant business. \nLetty looks at Michael, surprised. \nCORT Speak of the devil. (beat) How did you guys meet again? \nLETTY At the psych hospital. \nCORT I would've sent a card, but your aunt and I, we weren't sure if that was the thing to do. \nLETTY That's fine, Uncle Cort. \nCORT (to Michael) So you were a volunteer over at the hospital? \nMICHAEL Something like that. \nLETTY When he could get time off from the restaurant business. \nMICHAEL (to Letty) How about a dance? \nCORT You two go ahead. I'm going to go bother that pretty sister of yours for a dance. \nCort gives Letty another big, wet kiss. \nLETTY Bye, Uncle Cort. (to Michael) What's with the lie? \nMICHAEL It wasn't exactly a lie. \nLETTY Pretty close. \nMICHAEL People at weddings don't want the truth. \nMichael grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. \nLETTY It's not good to drink so much with the medication you're on. \nMICHAEL What's with this music? I'll go talk to the D.J. and see if we can't get something good going. \n", "test3_id": 2414}

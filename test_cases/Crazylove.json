{"train": "CRAZY LOVE \nWritten by \nCarol Watson \nREVISED 3/10/04 \nFADE IN: \nINT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - DAY \nThe sweet silence of slumber. Suddenly, an alarm clock on a nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas. \nA well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve. \nThen, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the \"William Tell Overture.\" Toes, also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser. \nLETTY MAYER, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music. She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are arranged by color, from white to beige to black. Behind the panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. Letty pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties. \nLetty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen suit. She lays it on the bed. Beast, her cat, jumps on the bed and settles into the jacket. Letty swoops the animal off her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit. \nLETTY Listen, Beast. What have I told you about linen? \nThe scolding is cut short by an \"Urge Overkill\" song that SCREAMS OUT from another room. On cue, Letty heads down the hall, dressing as she goes. She CLUCKS for Beast to follow. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME \nLetty turns off the alarm clock that BLASTS \"Urge Overkill\" from the counter and checks the time against her watch. \nShe swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food arranged by type. Seafood on the left, chicken in the middle, then, naturally, beef. Letty reaches for a can. \nLETTY (looking at Beast) It's liver saute. \nLetty considers the cat a moment, and chooses another can. \nLETTY \nFine, then, chicken in gravy. But you're going to have to eat the liver tomorrow. \nINT. BATHROOM - SAME \nLetty puts the finishing touches on her make-up and pulls back her hair, plastering an errant curl into place with hair spray. Yet another alarm clock sounds, this time BLARING the voice of shock jocks MARK AND BRIAN. \nINT. ENTRY HALL - SAME \nLetty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock, which is mounted near the front door. She bends down to kiss the cat good-bye, grabs a briefcase and leaves. \nEXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY \nA school bell BUZZES. Grade-schoolers, clutching lunch pails, scurry past Letty, who stands outside an office door. She straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to turn the handle. \nLetty is stopped cold when CHANDRA, 7, the victim of a bloody nose, runs up to her, bawling. \nCHANDRA Miss Mayer. Miss Mayer. \nLetty looks quickly at Chandra, her watch, the door. \nLETTY (to Chandra) Goodness, this is a bad one.   Tip your head back. \nShe bends down and pushes back Chandra's head. Chandra, off balance, places one very bloody hand on Letty's jacket lapel, staining it for all eternity. \nLetty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and guides Chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes. \nLETTY Come on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch it. \nINT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER \nPRINCIPAL GAIL LAUER, 40s, sits in uncomfortable silence with BILL JOHANSEN, the 50-something school Superintendent. Also present are MRS. MONTES, who is a School Board Member, and two other BOARD MEMBERS. \nPrincipal Gail glances at the clock. Mrs. Montes taps her foot. Johansen clears his throat. \nJOHANSEN Well, I have a full calendar today, and I'm afraid... \nThe door bursts open. Letty stumbles into the room. She clutches her briefcase to her chest, trying to cover her blood-smeared lapel. \nLETTY Mr. Johansen, hello. I'm so sorry I'm late. It's very nice to meet you. \nLetty continues to hug the briefcase while awkwardly bending down to shake hands with Johansen and the others. \nPRINCIPAL GAIL The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave. \nLETTY I do apologize.    A student had a crisis. \nMRS. MONTES A crisis, you say? \nLETTY A bloody nose... \nThere is no response. Letty reluctantly lowers the briefcase and reveals the stain. \nOne WOMAN IN THE RESTAURANT taps the side of her glass with her fork and raises a silent toast to Ruth. Other DINERS follow suit. Ruth grins back and starts to giggle. \nMRS. MAYER I'm so happy for you.     It's just wonderful. \nMrs. Mayer dabs her eyes with her napkin. \nMRS. MAYER My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness. \nLETTY Wow.   Congratulations. \nRuth dashes around the table to embrace the stunned Letty. \nRUTH (to Letty) Can you believe it? \nRuth sits back down and pulls a gorgeous ring from her purse. She slips it on and wiggles her finger in front of Letty and her mother, who peers at it with approval. \nMRS. MAYER Tell us every detail. \nLETTY You've only known Jake a few months. \nRUTH Three and a week. (screaming again) Isn't it great? \nMRS. MAYER My goodness. What about an engagement party? We must start planning. (signaling a waiter) Champagne. Girls, we need some champagne. \nOff Letty's frozen smile, we \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nLetty's in bed, drawing a giant multiplication chart. PAUL LASCHER, early 30s, handsome in a corporate way, shrugs off his expensive suit. \nHe opens a drawer of Letty's dresser, and removes a neatly pressed T-shirt. He smooths out another shirt he has accidently rumpled in the process. \nPAUL So, another one bites the dust. \nLETTY It's not another one. It's my sister. (beat) Aren't you happy for her? \nPAUL She's only known the guy a few months. \nPaul lays his folded trousers across Letty's desk. \nPAUL Can I put these here for tonight? \nLETTY (pointing to the closet) In there's better. (beat) It's kind of romantic, don't you think? \nPAUL I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well. \nPaul sits on the bed, and leans against a pillow. \nLETTY Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter. \nPAUL The receptionist said you called earlier about something. \nLetty holds up her multiplication chart and shows it to Paul. \nLETTY My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it. \nPAUL Good going. I knew you could do it. \nPaul kisses Letty on the cheek. \nPAUL It looks like we're both bucking for advancement. \nLETTY Yeah? \nPAUL Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate. \nLetty hugs Paul. \nLETTY Congratulations.    We should celebrate. \nPAUL I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark. \nLETTY I mean tonight. \nLetty sensually caresses his shoulders. \nLETTY Like right now... \nPAUL Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow? \nLETTY Oh, ok.   Maybe. \nPAUL But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across? \nLETTY (beat) Sure. Of course. \nLetty continues coloring her multiplication chart. \nRuth looks closer at Letty. \nRUTH Have you been crying?    Your eyes are all puffy. \nLetty self-consciously touches her eyes. \nLETTY Things have been kind of stressful lately. \nRUTH But everything's OK? \nRuth is trying on a veil at this point. \nLETTY Yeah, everything's under control. \nRUTH What about the engagement party? \nLETTY Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery. \nRUTH Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it. \nLetty sighs, moves to the racks and pulls out a dress. \nLETTY You better start trying on before the vultures get all the good ones. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER R uth twirls around in a taffeta gown as Letty picks up discarded dresses from the floor and hangs them up. \nRUTH What about this one? \nLETTY (with sisterly pride) You look beautiful. \nRUTH Really? \nLETTY Truly. \nMartha Mayer is led in by the clerk. \nLETTY Hi, Mom. \nRUTH Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress. \nMRS. MAYER You look just wonderful, Ruthie. But I really think you should try on a few more, don't you? \nLetty and Ruth shoot each other a look of doom. \nINT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER \nA bedraggled Letty and her mother fight the crowds to look at dresses. They are bumped and jostled from all sides. \nMRS. MAYER Has Paul heard about his promotion? \nLETTY No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it. \nRuth comes out of the dressing room in another gown. \nMRS. MAYER I don't like the bias cut on that one. \nMrs. Mayer holds up an ornate dress. \nRUTH No more. I can't stand to try on one more dress. \nMRS. MAYER Letty, I think this would be beautiful on you. \nLETTY Oh no. \nMRS. MAYER Paul could pop the question at any time. \nLETTY Mom, please. \nMRS. MAYER Especially with a promotion in the offing. \nRUTH Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you. \nLETTY (to Ruth) Do you think I should? \nRUTH Yes, yes.    It'll be fun. \nLetty takes the gown and disappears into the dressing room. \nINT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER \nLetty emerges from the dressing room. \nLETTY Mom?   Mom? Ruth? \nLetty peers around the corner, becoming a tad frantic. But neither her mother nor Ruth is to be found. It's just Letty, resplendent in ecru satin. \nCLERK I think they went over to the next shop to take a peek at shoes. \nLetty pushes back her veil, sits down on the floor and takes a sip of her now-cold coffee. \nPAUL Letty? \nLetty stands still, fixated on the olive bottle. \nPAUL Let?       L LETTY Olives Aux Herbes De Provence.    I got the wrong kind of olives. \nRuth holds up a glass. \nRUTH What's all the dreck? \nLETTY Sage, rosemary... (in a sarcastic French accent) Les Herbes. \nRUTH It'll be fine. \nLETTY No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate. \nJake enters.   The three turn on him. \nLETTY/PAUL/RUTH You can't leave them alone./Get back in there./Are you nuts? \nJake whirls around and exits. \nLetty looks for olives, banging open the cupboards one after the other. Quicker and quicker. More and more frantic. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - SAME \nJake, Mr. Mayer, Monica and Mrs. Mayer stare at each other, listening with alarm to the wild slamming of cupboards in the kitchen. \nJAKE What do you think of those Lakers? \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME \nLetty paws through her purse. \nPAUL What are you doing? \nLETTY (wild-eyed) Can you loan me a 20? \nPAUL Sure. Why? \nLETTY I'm going to the store. \nPAUL I think you're overreacting. \nLetty turns her best school marm look on Paul. He hands over a crisp bill. \nRUTH Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle... \nLETTY I'll be back before you can say souffle. \nLetty leaves from the kitchen's back door. Ruth heads to the living room. Paul leans wearily against the counter, savoring one of the herb-filled martinis. \nINT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT \nFluorescent lights beat down on Letty. She races through the aisles. She clutches her keys in one hand, a $20 bill in the other. Letty careens around a corner. At the last second, she avoids smacking into another shopper. She stops. L LETTY'S POV: \nShelf after shelf of olives...black olives...all black. \nBACK TO SCENE: \nLetty darts up and down the aisle, searching, searching. Nothing. \nLetty scurries to the front of the store. She taps a STORE CLERK on the shoulder. Six people waiting in line mutter, annoyed. \nLETTY I can't find martini olives.     All you have are black. \nSTORE CLERK (without looking up) Aisle 2A. \nLetty whips down an aisle.    She starts to sweat. \nAn OLD LADY blocks her path. \nOLD LADY Excuse me, Miss. I can't reach the cat food. \nLetty pauses.    She reaches up and hands the woman a can of food. \nOLD LADY And a turkey and giblets, too, please. She does like her turkey. \nLetty grabs another can, throws it in the Old Lady's cart and darts away while the Old Lady continues to talk. \nLETTY'S POV: \nThe sign for Aisle 2A.    Olives.   Lots of them.   Green.   All shapes. All sizes. \nBACK TO SCENE: \nLetty's shoulders relax.    She scans the shelf. \nLETTY's POV: \nLetty pulls herself up to a sitting position. \nMICHAEL Do you mind if I call you Letitia? \nLETTY Letty. \nMICHAEL (consulting his notes) First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are? \nLETTY I answered these questions last night. \nMICHAEL I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night. \nLETTY Hillview Psychiatric Hospital. \nMICHAEL Great. Now, Letty, I'd like you to remember three items. I'm going to ask you to repeat them in just a few minutes. They are chair, cup and ball. Did you get that? \nLetty nods. \nMICHAEL OK, let's subtract 6 from a succession of numbers starting with \nLETTY \nMICHAEL And 85 minus 6? \nLETTY \nMichael waits. \nLETTY No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous. \nMICHAEL It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing. L Letty smiles uncomfortably. \nMICHAEL Now the three things I asked you to remember. \nLETTY Chair, cup and ball. \nMICHAEL Terrific. \nLetty smiles, a real smile this time. \nMICHAEL Let me shift gears here a minute... (beat) Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't? \nLETTY No. \nMICHAEL What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again? \nLetty shakes her head \"no.\" \nMICHAEL How about arranging your possessions in a certain way? \nLetty pauses. \nMICHAEL Yes?   Go right ahead. \nLETTY Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear. \nMichael leans closer. \nMICHAEL How do you sort it--by lace and cotton? \nLETTY By color. \nMICHAEL What if it's got a pattern? \nLETTY Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem. \nMICHAEL I see. (looking at his notes) How long has it been since you've done something you've enjoyed, Letty? \nLETTY (beat) A while, I guess. \nMICHAEL That must be really difficult. \nLetty tears up.   Michael puts his hand lightly on her arm. \nMICHAEL Hey, it'll be OK.   We'll make sure of that. \nLetty gives him an appreciative look. \nMICHAEL For now, why don't you just take it easy while I confer with my colleagues. A nurse should be in shortly. \nINT. LETTY'S ROOM - LATER \nLetty, dressed and made up, sits rigidly on the bed. She writes in her organizer. DR. ROBERT EMLEE, early 40s and in jeans, enters with his own organizer. \nDR. EMLEE Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you... \nLETTY I did this already. \nDR. EMLEE It's hospital policy... \nINT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nLetty lags behind NURSE GATES, early 30s and in civilian clothes, as they walk down the hall. \nNURSE GATES Treatment schedules are posted on the bulletin board. Dinner at 6, lights out at 10 and no fraternizing between patients. \nLetty nods. \nNURSE GATES (pointing as she goes) That's the rec room. We show movies there on Wednesdays and Fridays...And this is the dining hall. \nLetty stops in her tracks at the sight of the room, an upscale version of a college cafeteria. Groups of people eat and talk. A paper airplane sails from one table to another. \nLETTY I'm really not that hungry. \nNURSE GATES Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people. \nLETTY You know, my mom's coming to get me tomorrow. I'll be leaving. \nNURSE GATES It's OK, Letty. I'll be right here with you. \nINT. DINING HALL - SAME \nNurse Gates guides Letty to a table where John, Mrs. Hallstrom, Marie and Thomas sit. \nTHOMAS So I said to my publisher this afternoon, I said, don't you even-- \nNURSE GATES (interrupts) Hi, gang. I want to introduce you to Letty. (to Letty) Letty, this is Mrs. Hallstrom and Marie, and John and Thomas. \nTHOMAS (to Letty) Just discussing my pesky publisher. May I ask what you do when you're not vacationing? \nMARIE (to Thomas) Let the poor girl get some food, for Heaven's sake. \nLETTY I'm a teacher. \nTHOMAS As you may have gathered, I'm a writer. \nJohn snorts. Thomas ignores him.   Mrs. Hallstrom stares down at her plate. \nTHOMAS I don't like to say novelist. That sounds a little grandiose, but I am on my third novel and... \nNURSE GATES Excuse me for interrupting, Thomas, but we really should get some food... \nNurse Gates leads Letty to a table, and hands her a plate. Letty looks up to see Michael at the other end of the table, doing a card trick for two OTHER PATIENTS. \nMICHAEL (to patients) Now I'm going to say that the card you picked was the Ace of Spades. \nHe flips the top card up and it's the Ace of Spades.       The patients chortle. \nNURSE GATES Michael. \nMichael turns toward the nurse. \nNURSE GATES Michael, this is Letty.      She just arrived yesterday. \nLetty stares at Michael coldly. \nLETTY We've met. (to Michael) I missed you during rounds this morning. \nLetty turns and leaves, carrying her empty plate with her. \nNURSE GATES (to Michael) This doctor thing has got to stop. \nNurses Gates hurries after Letty. \nEXT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY \nLetty stands outside the waiting room door.       She tucks her blouse into her jeans and enters. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY \nLetty's mother sits on the edge of a couch in a room that looks much like the library of an English country manor. She springs up as soon as she spots Letty. They rush to each other. Letty's mother strokes her hair. M RS. MAYER I'm here, Sweetheart.      I'm here. It's going to be OK. \nLETTY I'm sorry.     I'm so sorry. \nMRS. MAYER Oh, Letty, what happened? \nLETTY Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... (MORE) \nLETTY(cont'd) They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened. \nMRS. MAYER I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says... \nLETTY I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors... \nMRS. MAYER Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing. \nLETTY I just want to go home.   Can we go home now? \nMRS. MAYER I think the best thing for you right now is to stay here and get well. \nPATIENTS Go, Girl!/ Come on, Michael. \nMICHAEL Oh, no, you're perfectly sane. That's why you're here. \nLetty looks like she's been slapped. She thinks for a moment. The patients wait, breathless, for her retort. \nLETTY Go fuck yourself. \nMichael grins at Letty. She turns, and strides down the hall. There's a smattering of applause. It grows stronger. \nWe see Letty's eyes fill with tears as, behind her, the patients yell. \nPATIENTS Bravo./Encore./Re-match. \nINT. LETTY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nLetty, unable to sleep, tosses and turns. She gets out of bed and paces the room nervously, trying to hold herself together. She slumps to the floor and starts to cry. \nINT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY D r. Emlee and seven patients sit in a circle of metal folding chairs. Michael, who sits next to Emlee, practices rolling a quarter back and forth across his fingers. \nLetty sits across from Michael and Emlee, her legs and arms crossed tightly. The group concentrates on Mrs. Hallstrom. \nMRS. HALLSTROM I can't stop thinking about the things I did wrong when my daughter was little. \nDR. EMLEE And how's that make you feel? \nMRS. HALLSTROM I just feel like sleeping.    All the time. \nTHOMAS Hell's bells, you can count me in on that. I haven't had enough Z's since I ran those sleep disorder experiments at Stanford back in the 70s. \nMARIE We really miss doing things with you, Mrs. Hallstrom. \nMichael, sitting next to Mrs. Hallstrom, squeezes her arm. \nMRS. HALLSTROM Maybe when I hit my manic phase again. \nGroup members smile. \nJOHN I've noticed Letty doesn't much like to do things with us. \nThe group looks expectantly at Letty. \nLETTY Oh, no. Of course I do. \nJOHN Then why are you so defensive? \nMICHAEL (to John) I don't think we need to sacrifice Letty to pep up a slow session. \nJOHN (to Michael) You're the one who told everyone about her panties. \nMichael grimaces at John.   Letty's head is bent down. \nDR. EMLEE Maybe you'd like to share some of your feelings about OCD or depression with us, Letty. \nLetty eyes the doctor.   She's dangerously close to tears. \nLETTY Do we have to talk about this? \nDR. EMLEE I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others. \nMichael reaches his hand behind Dr. Emlee's head, catching Letty's eye in the process. Michael pulls a silver dollar out of Emlee's ear. \nLetty looks but doesn't respond. The other patients ignore Michael. Emlee is oblivious. \nDR. EMLEE You never know, Letty, how the person sitting next to you may be able to shed light on one of your problems... \nMichael goes for a bigger trick. Reaching again behind the doctor's head, he produces a small bouquet of paper flowers. Letty, almost against her will, smiles. \nDR. EMLEE ...by revealing something that's going on in his or her own life. \nMichael waves the flowers back and forth behind the doctor's head. Letty's smile broadens. \nDR. EMLEE (responding to her smile) There, now, I knew you'd feel better once we discussed group process. Let's talk a little about your OCD. \nINT. LIBRARY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY \nLetty ponders a shelf of ratty paperbacks. Michael turns the corner, thumbing through a dog-eared book. Letty spots him and moves away. Michael sidles up next to her. M ICHAEL Looking for a romance? \nLETTY Excuse me? \nMICHAEL What are you looking to read? \nLETTY Anything interesting. \nMichael holds out his book to her. \nMICHAEL This is good. \nLetty glances at the title, \"101 MAGIC TRICKS.\" \nPAUL I just wish we'd done it sooner. \nPaul takes Letty's hand in his. \nPAUL Will you marry me? \nPaul pulls a diamond ring from his pocket and puts it on Letty's finger. She stares at it, mesmerized. \nPAUL I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry. \nLETTY (by rote) Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients. \nPAUL I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines. (beat) L Letty? \nLETTY It's, it's really nice, Paul. \nPAUL You can take it back and we can have one custom made if you want. \nLETTY No, you've done a perfect job. \nPAUL So, what do you say, Let? \nLetty looks him in the eyes for the first time. \nLETTY Do you think, really, that it's OK to get engaged when I'm in here? \nPAUL Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind. \nLETTY No, no. \nPAUL So will you? \nLETTY (working up a smile) Of course. Yes. I will.     I do. \nPaul and Letty kiss, then hug. \nEXT. COURTYARD - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - LATER \nIt's completely dark. Letty sits in the same position we saw her in hours ago. Michael walks up to her. \nMICHAEL You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner. \nLETTY I wasn't hungry. \nMICHAEL John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk. \nLETTY (smiling) Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night. \nMICHAEL Was it bad news--the visit from Peter? \nLETTY Paul. \nMICHAEL He looked pretty serious. \nLETTY He asked me to marry him. \nMICHAEL Very romantic setting. \nLETTY It was romantic.   He's very romantic. \nMICHAEL So are you engaged, or what? \nLetty holds out her hand, where the diamond glistens. Michael bends forward to look at the ring, caressing her hand as he does so. \nLetty pulls away. The ring is gone. \nLETTY What have you done with the ring? \nMICHAEL It's magic. \nLetty stands up. \nLETTY This isn't funny.   Paul would kill me. \nMichael holds his hands in fists toward Letty. \nMICHAEL Guess which hand. \nLETTY Enough with the abracadabra. \nMICHAEL Guess. \nLETTY T he left one. \nMichael opens his hand.   It's empty.   Michael addresses an imaginary audience. \nMICHAEL (to audience) The fair maiden guesses incorrectly. Should we give her one more try? (to Letty) The audience says one more try. What guess you now? \nLETTY The right one. \nMrs. Hallstrom gives an eraser to the nurse. \nNURSE GATES Come on. Come with me, Mrs. Hallstrom. \nNurse Gates leads Mrs. Hallstrom away as the older woman continues tossing erasers down the hall. \nMarie stares at Michael's shorts. \nMARIE Hot boxers. \nMichael smiles awkwardly at Letty. She returns to her room. \nINT. LETTY'S ROOM - SAME \nLetty climbs into bed. She opens the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Tiffany's ring box. There, cradled in the satin lining, is the diamond from Paul. Right beside it is Michael's Cracker Jack special. L Letty puts on Paul's ring. She studies her hand. With an air of secrecy, she slips on Michael's ring. She quickly takes it off. Wearing Paul's ring, she turns off the light and snuggles into bed. \nEXT. GARDEN, HILLV IEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY \nAfternoon light casts long shadows in the garden of pruned hedges and tea roses. Letty and Ruth power-walk down a cobblestone path, heading away from the English Tudor hospital that looms large in the background. \nLetty wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the logo for the University of South Carolina Cocks. \nLETTY I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt. \nRUTH Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here. \nLETTY That settles it. I'm never leaving. \nRUTH I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster. \nLETTY You're slowing. \nRUTH (picking up the pace) Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white. \nLetty checks her stop watch. \nRUTH What do you think? \nLETTY Ecru. \nRUTH And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print? \nLetty completely stops and faces Ruth. \nLETTY Do we have to talk wedding details? \nRUTH Oh, no, of course not. \nLETTY I mean, you can always send me fabric samples to look at or pictures of dresses. But, it's been so long since we've seen each other. \nRUTH Of course. You're right. Besides, we should be talking about your engagement. \nThey start walking again. \nLETTY Tell me more about Beast beating up that other cat. \nRUTH Bloody furry mess, like I said. (beat) Aren't you so excited about Paul? beat) Letty? \nRuth stops this time. \nRUTH What's going on with you, Letty? \nLETTY Ruthie, do you ever wonder if you'll meet someone else...someone besides Jake? \nPower walking's forgotten.   Ruth and Letty start to amble. \nRUTH What's his name, Letty? \nLETTY I didn't say... \nRUTH Don't even try.    What's his name? \nINT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nNurse Gates passes by the open door, and pokes her head in. \nNURSE GATES Lights out, Letty. \nLetty closes the door. She pulls a nightshirt from a drawer, disrupting a perfectly-folded T-shirt. Letty bends down to straighten it, but changes her mind. She shuts the drawer. \nLetty puts on the nightshirt, crawls into bed and snaps off the light. She fluffs her pillow, and turns over. She rolls back. \nLetty turns on the light. She goes to the drawer, opens it, pulls out the T-shirt and refolds it. She shuts the drawer. Letty yanks open the drawer again and looks at her handiwork. \nIt's a fight with the drawer. Opened and closed. Until Letty takes a deep breath, pulls it open a final time, hesitantly ruffles the T-shirt and slams the drawer shut. \nShe runs to bed and hops in, turning off the light and burying her head under the pillow. \nA few moments pass. \nNURSE GATES It's OK.   It's good to let it out. \nMichael passes the open door with the pizza box and points down the hall. Letty stares right through him. \nNURSE GATES Did you ever tell Paul how you felt? \nLETTY He was graduating from law school, and he just assumed I was OK with dropping out. (beat) We never really talked about it. But I know he was disappointed in me. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LINEN CLOSET - LATER \nThe roomy closet houses an inconceivable number of white sheets and towels, arranged on wide, tall shelves. \nThe pizza, cokes and a candle sit in the middle of the floor, which Michael has draped with a sheet. Michael stares at the dwindling candle.                                  C UT TO: \nINT. LETTY'S ROOM - SAME \nLETTY I mean I'm just not sure I want the same things now that I did even a month ago. \nNurse Gates nods sympathetically. \nLETTY Is that so wrong? \nMichael passes the open door again, waving his hands wildly to attract Letty's attention. She doesn't notice him. \nNURSE GATES You can only do what feels best to you now. \nLETTY I guess so. I think that's right. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LINEN CLOSET - SAME \nMichael blows out the candle. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LETTY'S ROOM - SAME \nLetty blows her nose as she walks Nurse Gates to the door. \nLETTY You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things. \nNURSE GATES I'm glad. \nLETTY And if I need to talk again... \nNURSE GATES Yes, of course. Whenever you want. \nLetty gives Nurse Gates a hug. \nINT. LINEN CLOSET - SAME \nTAPS on the door. Michael looks up. He jumps to his feet and lets Letty in, gesturing for her to sit. They lean against a stack of pillows. \nLETTY Sorry I'm late... \nMichael puts his finger to Letty's lips. \nMICHAEL Shhh. \nA SERIES OF SHOTS THAT FADE INTO EACH OTHER: \nA.) The two munch on pizza. Michael picks off black olives and hands them to Letty, who plops them on top of her pizza. \nB.) Michael hands Letty a cigarette. She gestures no.       He lights one for himself and begins blowing smoke rings. \nC.) Michael offers Letty pizza.     She clutches her stomach to show that she's full. \nD.) Letty indicates she wants a cigarette. Michael demonstrates how to smoke, affecting the style of a 1930s movie star. Letty follows suit. E .) Letty grabs a pillow and hits Michael over the head. He pulls the pillow away from her. Letty stands up, grabs another pillow and hits Michael again. He whacks her in the back of the knees and she falls on top of him. \nEnough of the fighting.    They kiss.   Michael strokes the back of Letty's neck. \nFOOTSTEPS approach the door and stop. Michael and Letty stop kissing and look at the door. The FOOTSTEPS continue on. \nMichael pulls Letty's shirt up. She starts to pull it over her head, but can't get it all the way off in the cramped space. Michael kisses Letty's mouth through the shirt. She GIGGLES. Michael helps Letty off with the shirt. \nHe kisses her chest.    Letty bites him lightly on the shoulder. \nMichael pulls away in surprise, grinning. Letty reaches up and bites him again. Michael bites her back. \nLetty reaches her hands behind her head, searching for something to hold onto. She grabs a stack of sheets, which topple onto Michael. \nMichael sits up, trying to clear the sheets off himself and Letty. Letty pushes him down and crawls on top of him. \nCLOSE ON her hands as they unbutton Michael's Levis, and we \nFADE OUT \nLETTY Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions. \nMICHAEL Fuck.    That's all true. \nLetty laughs. \nMICHAEL Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes. \nLETTY What are the delusions like? \nMICHAEL I think people are after me, crap like that. (beat) (MORE) \nMICHAEL(cont'd) When I was 18, my mom came home and found me sitting naked on the kitchen table. I thought I was God. \nHe waits for Letty to register the information. \nMICHAEL Shocking, huh? \nLETTY Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store. \nMICHAEL I wish I could have seen that. \nLETTY I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent. \nMICHAEL M y Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light. (beat) But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones. \nLying on their backs, Michael and Letty stare up at the leaves overhead. \nMICHAEL (with a start) Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up. \nLETTY Break up?    They wish. \nMichael and Letty hug. \nINT. NURSES' STATION - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY \nNurse Gates pours tablets from a potpourri of pill bottles into little paper cups. A Federal Express delivery man with a bunch of boxes stops at the station. \nDELIVERY MAN I need a signature, please. \nNurse Gates looks at the form. \nNURSE GATES What is all this stuff? \nDELIVERY MAN I just deliver it, Ma'am. \nNURSE GATES Well, who exactly is it for? \nDELIVERY MAN A Mrs. Eunice Hallstrom. \nNURSE GATES I see. Can you wait a moment? \nNurse Gates locks the medication in a cupboard, and hurries down the hallway. \nINT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - SAME \nOur usual cast of characters. \nDR. EMLEE But how does that make you feel, John, what Letty said about your hostility? \nJOHN She doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. \nNurse Gates barrels in.   The group looks up. \nNURSE GATES I'm sorry, Doctor. I just need a moment with Mrs. Hallstrom. \nDR. EMLEE What seems to be the problem? \nNURSE GATES They say she ordered...Mrs. Hallstrom, did you order a bunch of stuff, because Federal Express... M rs. Hallstrom's face glows. \nMRS. HALLSTROM It's here, everyone. Come along. It's here. \nShe runs out. Nurse Gates follows her. A moment passes.    The patients look expectantly at Dr. Emlee. \nDR. EMLEE Oh, fine, let's see. \nThey storm the door. \nINT. NURSES' STATION - SAME \nBy the time the patients round the corner, the Federal Express man is leaving, and Mrs. Hallstrom has ripped open one of the boxes. She clutches a handful of jewelry. \nMRS. HALLSTROM For you, John. And, Letty. And, Michael, I know you'll love these. \nShe hands Michael a pair of faux sapphire earrings. He clips them on. Letty and several others carry necklaces. Thomas sports a rhinestone tiara. The patients compare jewelry. \nDR. EMLEE Mrs. Hallstrom, you ordered all this? \nJOHN (to Mrs. Hallstrom) Thomas got a crown and all I got was a lousy bracelet? \nJUDGE MILTON Where will you live upon release? \nJOHN Live? \nJohn's mother nods encouragingly at him. \nJUDGE MILTON Where do you plan to reside, Mr. Lockyer? \nJOHN With my mother. \nJUDGE MILTON Is your mother here today? \nJohn points to her.   John's mother waves at the judge. \nJOHN That's the bitch. That cock- sucking bitch. She put me here. She did. She's the Satan that did this all. \nAs bailiffs remove John from the stand, Michael offers a wan smile to his family. \nINT. COMMITMENT COURT - LATER \nMichael, outwardly poised and collected, sits on the stand. His hands are clenched in tight fists. \nJUDGE MILTON The records indicate no major episodes in the past four months. And it seems you have the support of the staff. \nMICHAEL Yes, Sir. \nJUDGE MILTON But I see you've been in and out of the hospital more than ten times. \nMICHAEL Eleven, Your Honor.   But I'm on a new medication now. \nJUDGE MILTON Do you feel ready to re-enter the world? \nMICHAEL Yes, Sir. My family is    prepared to support me until I find   a job. They've already located   an apartment for me that's   very near them. \nJUDGE MILTON Very well, then. By order of the court, you are released. I wish you good luck. \nMichael's shoulders relax. He opens his fist. Inside is the Cracker Jack ring, and the magenta circle it has imprinted on his palm. \nEXT. COMMITMENT COURT - LATER \nMichael walks to the car with his mother, father and grandmother, who keeps tousling his hair with pride. \nINT. VISITING ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY \nLetty stands awkwardly in front of Paul, who sits in a wingback chair. \nPAUL What's so urgent?   You've got me worried. \nLETTY I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how. \nPaul stands. \nPAUL You can tell me anything. (beat) Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure? \nLETTY No... \nPAUL That's a load off my mind. \nLETTY Paul, I want to break off the engagement. P AUL You what? \nLETTY I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you. \nPAUL Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems. \nLETTY I've met someone else. \nPAUL Who? \nLETTY It doesn't matter who. \nPAUL Have you been seeing another teacher? \nLETTY No. \nPAUL It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin. \nLETTY He's a patient here. \nPaul considers this a moment. \nPAUL Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking? \nLETTY I love him. \nPAUL You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love? \nLETTY Here's the ring. \nPAUL No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses. \nMARIE I'll put in 5 that it's a straight diagnosis of depressive personality. \nLETTY Are you kidding? With those glazed eyes? I'm willing to bet 10 there was some break with reality going on there. Psychosis. Without a doubt, psychosis. \nINT. DR. EMLEE'S OFFICE - DAY \nLetty is curled up in a chair opposite Dr. Emlee. \nLETTY But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work. \nDR. EMLEE Have you been in contact with the principal about your job? \nLETTY I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out. \nDR. EMLEE Then, you should call. \nLETTY What? \nDR. EMLEE I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well. \nLETTY Are you saying I'm through with therapy? \nDR. EMLEE Let's not be hasty. (beat) I'm saying we should plan a release date for early next week. \nOff Letty's excited face, we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TARGET - DAY \nCrowds, crowds and more crowds. Michael pulls unsuccessfully at a shopping cart that is stuck to another. \nA MATRONLY WOMAN walks up, nudges Michael out of the way and yanks the cart out of its row. She rolls it toward Michael, grabs one for herself and is on her way into the store. M ichael takes several deep breaths. With trepidation in his step, he heads into the great unknown of the crowded store... \nEXT. TARGET - 30 MINUTES LATER \nMichael emerges from the store, quite pleased with himself that he made it out alive. He commands a cart heaped full of useless gadgets and trinkets, a half dozen picture frames and about 20 decorative pillows. \nEXT. GROUNDS - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY \nLetty and her mother walk briskly through the gardens. \nMRS. MAYER Must you walk so quickly? \nLETTY It's good exercise, Mom. \nMRS. MAYER I've got 26 years on you. If we could just slow down, we could talk so much easier. \nLetty slackens her pace. \nMRS. MAYER I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will. \nLETTY I've already made arrangements. \nMRS. MAYER Ruthie mentioned that Michael might be coming for you. \nLetty stops and wags her finger at her mother. \nLETTY Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael. \nMRS. MAYER Not even if it's something positive? \nLETTY Nyet.   That's the condition. \nMother and daughter keep walking in silence. \nMRS. MAYER Have you spoken to Paul at all? \nLETTY One more and you're out. \nMRS. MAYER Honestly, Letty. \nLETTY A deal's a deal. \nThe two walk on in silence. \nSilence. \nMore silence. \nMRS. MAYER Have you heard the figure on how much Queen Elizabeth's going to pay in taxes this year? \nLetty stops walking. She turns a sunny smile on her mother, then hugs her.      L LETTY I knew you had it in you. \nINT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY \nLetty neatly folds garments and lays them in a suitcase.    Dr. Emlee looks on. \nDR. EMLEE So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me. \nLetty sits on the floor. She gulps down some aspirin, then hauls Beast into her lap. The doorbell RINGS. \nLETTY It's open. \nMichael walks in, and looks around. \nMICHAEL Gosh, Letty, this is a great place. \nLETTY Thanks. \nHe kisses her, and lies down on the floor to stroke the cat. M ICHAEL This must be Beast. \nLETTY That's Mr. Beast to you. \nMICHAEL How was your day? \nLETTY I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing. \nMICHAEL Sounds grim. \nLETTY Yeah.    How was the job search? \nMichael makes a thumbs-down gesture. \nLETTY Who ever said sanity was fun? \nMICHAEL It doesn't matter.    It'll work out. \nLETTY Promise? \nMICHAEL Promise. (beat) As long as we have steak. \nLETTY Steak? \nMICHAEL It's a well-known fact that a red- meat dinner can cure the blues. (beat) You and Beast wait here. I'll be back in a jiff. \nLetty gives Michael a tired smile. Michael jumps up and leaves. A moment passes. The door opens again. \nMICHAEL While I'm gone why don't you slip into something a little more naked? \nEXT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT \nMichael walks out of the grocery store, loaded down with bags. He carries a bottle of wine and a bunch of flowers. \nHe passes two ladies who gossip outside the store. \nLADY ONE I can't believe he did that. \nLADY TWO What a weirdo. \nMichael stops abruptly.   He turns back and looks at the women. They LAUGH. \nMichael starts toward the car. He hears more LAUGHTER from the women. He turns back and walks up to them. \nMICHAEL Don't ever talk about me again, you hear me? \nThe women pull back in fright. \nINT. KITCHEN - LETTY'S APARTMENT - LATER \nLetty, in a skimpy negligee, lights candles on the table. Michael enters with the groceries and wine. \nLETTY I thought maybe you got lost. \nMICHAEL The store was busy. \nLETTY You got wine. That's great. \nM \nMICHAEL Would you mind if we just called it an early night? \nLETTY You go ahead and relax. I'll cook. M ICHAEL I think I should go home. \nLETTY Are you OK? \nMICHAEL Big restaurant interview tomorrow. \nLETTY But what about the red meat-blues thing? \nMICHAEL You know, we've got that dinner with my parents tomorrow, too. I should really get some rest tonight. \nMichael gives Letty a kiss good night. He leaves. She stares after him. Reluctantly, she blows out the candles and starts putting the groceries away. \nLETTY (to Beast) How's filet sound? \nINT. RESTAURANT - DAY \nThe coffee shop hasn't opened for business yet. Michael and six people in their early 20s fill out applications. \nLETTY I think I could get the program up and running in the next two weeks. \nJOHANSEN From what I understand the principal has removed you from student activities. \nLETTY She's worried that I'm unstable. \nJohansen studies her. \nLETTY But I wouldn't push for the program if I wasn't ready. \nJOHANSEN What about the office work? \nLETTY I'd have to do that, too. But I've gotten better at pacing myself. \nJOHANSEN Are you sure? \nLETTY I'll call you if I have problems. Scout's honor. \nJOHANSEN I have to say I'm inclined to give it another try. \nLetty hugs Johansen. \nJOHANSEN But, Letty, why don't you give yourself three weeks to set it up this time? \nINT. MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nMichael sits in the same booth, eating a hamburger.   About half of the application is now completed. \nINT. TUXEDO SHOP - NIGHT \nLetty and her mother sit in silence. Letty smiles at her mother. Her mother gives her a very tiny smile back. \nMichael hurries in. \nMICHAEL Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer. \nLETTY I got worried. Are you OK? \nMichael pulls a blue polyester hat out of his pocket and puts it on.               M ICHAEL How may I help you? \nLETTY Congratulations. \nMRS. MAYER Michael, the shop's about to close. Maybe you could try on your tux. \nMichael heads to the dressing room in the back of the store. \nLETTY (to Mrs. Mayer) Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him? \nMRS. MAYER I will, Dear. I promise. (beat) Why McDonald's? \nLETTY He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away. \nLetty looks toward the back of the store.    Her mother looks at her. Letty ignores her mother. \nMRS. MAYER I've read that lots of people my age are supplementing their incomes these days by working at McDonald's and Burger King. \nLetty looks at her mother, tries to read her. \nLETTY I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded. \nMRS. MAYER Don't be fresh. \nLETTY Just remember that I love him. \nMichael walks out of the dressing room and advances toward the two women, bowing in Cary Grant fashion as he nears. \nLetty's mother turns to her daughter, who beams brightly at the dashing Michael. \nMRS. MAYER (to Letty) I'll say this, Dear.   He looks damn good in a tuxedo. \nEXT. TRACK - DAY \nLetty and Michael jog. \nMICHAEL Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin? \nLETTY No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker. \nMICHAEL Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic? \nLETTY You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years. \nINT. CHURCH - DAY \nEvery inch of every pew in the Baroque church is stuffed with guests. Michael sits in the second row. He cranes his head around as \"Pachelbel's Canon\" RINGS OUT and the FLOWER GIRL L advances. \nLetty, in the first part of the bride's maids' procession, heads down the aisle next. The bride is nowhere in sight. \nBut even so, as soon as Michael spots Letty, he stands. Everyone else remains seated. They look at him. Michael doesn't notice. He has eyes only for Letty. \nMichael heads toward the D.J. and confers with him.    Mr. Mayer walks up to Letty. \nMR. MAYER It's good to see you so happy. \nLETTY Thanks, dad. \nMichael then walks back to Letty and pulls her out onto the dance floor as \"Twist and Shout\" BOOMS OUT from the speakers. \nLetty's mother departs the dance floor, grimacing. Ruth shoots Michael a look of pure pleasure. And everyone begins twisting, as we \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCompletely dark.   Silent. \nLetty, in a nightshirt, wanders in, and stumbles through the room. She fumbles for the switch on the floor lamp. \nThe light comes on, illuminating a small circle.    Just outside of it sits Michael. H e stares straight ahead.    Letty kneels down in front of him. \nLETTY Michael? (beat) Michael? You should come to bed. \nMichael remains focused on the space directly in front of him. \nLETTY Did you take the aspirin and water? You don't want to feel awful in the morning. (beat) I'll get you some. \nLetty begins to stand up. The movement breaks Michael's trance. He pulls her back down. \nLETTY What is it? Are you OK? \nMICHAEL (strangely calm) Always the drugs. \nLETTY What? \nMICHAEL I saw you talking to my Mom. \nLETTY We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad. \nMICHAEL Why'd you tell her I wasn't taking my meds? \nLETTY What do you mean not taking your meds? \nMICHAEL Why'd you tell? \nLETTY I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly. \nMichael beats his hand on the floor. \nMICHAEL Silly?   Silly am I? \nLETTY Michael, take it easy. \nMICHAEL Silly, silly, silly. \nLETTY I think I should call someone. \nMichael reaches out, grabs the floor lamp, and pushes it over. He lurches to his feet and pulls Letty to a standing position. \nMICHAEL (screaming) Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom. \nLETTY Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK. \nMichael knocks some flowers over, then rips apart a pillow. \nLetty hovers in back of him.     He pauses.   She puts her hand on his back. \nMichael whirls around.   He slaps Letty's hand away. She stumbles backward. \nLETTY Michael, stop. \nHe stares in her direction, but he doesn't respond.      Letty can't make a connection. \nMichael shoves his fist through a window. \nLetty grabs the phone. \nMICHAEL Not my Mom. Not my silly silly Mom. \nLetty runs with the phone. Michael follows her. Letty trips. She rights herself. She locks herself in the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM, MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - SAME M ichael POUNDS on the bathroom door.     Letty dials 9-1-1. \nLETTY I've got an emergency.    I'm at... \nMichael HOWLS -- a long, piercing inhuman sound. \nLETTY 1450 North Jenkins. Apartment 2. My boyfriend's out of control. \nOn the other side of the door, Michael SCREAMS.    Another window SHATTERS. \nLETTY Michael.   Yes. \nPAUL I just wondered, well, if this meant there was a chance for us. Because I think about you a lot, and I still feel... \nLETTY Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over. (beat) And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things. \nPAUL I think I've heard this speech before. \nLETTY I'm really sorry. \nLetty reaches up to hug him.    He quickly disengages himself. P AUL I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind... \nLETTY Sure, I understand. \nPaul starts down the path. \nLETTY Wait. Wait. \nLetty runs up to Paul. \nLETTY I need to give you this. \nLetty hands Paul the engagement ring. He takes it and continues walking as she stares after him. \nEXT. HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY \nLetty walks up the steps to the imposing facility. We follow her journey through the VISITING ROOM, past families conversing with patients, to the NURSES' STATION. \nLetty walks up to Nurse Gates, who gives her a quick hug. John and Bill watch as Letty signs the visitors' register. \nNURSE GATES He's in Jamie's old room. \nLetty walks down the HALLWAY and pauses outside Michael's door. She KNOCKS. \nMICHAEL (OS) Come in. \nINT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME \nMichael is in the middle of taping up the same Houdini poster we saw in his last room when Letty enters. \nLETTY Hi. \nMICHAEL Hey. \nLetty and Michael kiss awkwardly.    Dead silence. \nLETTY/MICHAEL (TOGETHER) How are you? \nThey smile nervously. \nLETTY I guess we need to talk. \nMICHAEL I guess so. \nLETTY It's hard to know where to start. \nMICHAEL Pretend like I'm your shrink. \nLetty rolls her eyes. \nMICHAEL Sorry.   I'll be quiet. \nLETTY I think about you all the time. \nMICHAEL I sure know what that feels like. \nLETTY And all the plans we have. \nMICHAEL Yeah, the plans. \nLetty looks out the window. \nLETTY I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see... \nMICHAEL Letty, please. L LETTY What? \nMICHAEL Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me. \nLETTY Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications. \nMICHAEL But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that. \nLETTY Well then why'd it happen? \nMICHAEL I don't know. I don't fucking know. \nLetty and Michael glare at each other.    Letty looks away. \nLETTY I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you. \n", "test1_input": "Zach approaches the board and begins to write, \"I am...\"    He doesn't get any further before Letty cuts him off. \nLETTY Neater, Zach. \nZach begins again, but Letty stops him when he reaches \"am.\" \nLETTY Zach, you know the line by the \"a\" has to come straight down or it looks like an \"o.\" \nZach looks back toward his classmates for help. \nLETTY What's wrong, Zach? \nLetty picks up a piece of chalk and writes an \"a.\" She erases it furiously and works at it until the \"a\" is perfect. L LETTY Try again, Zach.    Like that. \nLetty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk. Zach freezes. He sees Letty's shoes, her arm, her contorted face, and, above all else, that perfect \"a\" staring right back down at him. \nLetty grips Zach's arm, guiding the chalk to form what looks like a pretty good \"a.\" \nLETTY I don't believe it.    You still can't do it. \nZACH I'm sorry, OK, Miss Mayer? \nLETTY No, it's not OK. You'll never get to college on OK. \nLetty's fingers press into Zach's arm. A tear slides ominously down his cheek. \nLETTY It has to be good, Zach.   Do you understand me? \nZach wrests free of Letty. He's in full cry now. He backs away, stumbles, then makes a run for his seat. Bobby SNICKERS at Zach's misfortune. Other children glance around, unsure, confused. \nLetty looks vacantly at the children, stares at the board and looks at the children again. \nShe sits down at her desk and buries her face in her hands. Letty's fists, clenched at first, slowly relax. She takes a deep breath and raises her head. \nLETTY I'm very, very sorry, Zach. \nZach continues to cry. Letty looks down at her desk. She grabs a piece of construction paper and a jar of paste. \nLETTY You know what, guys? Wednesday's not a grammar day. It's a collage day. It's a collage ON THE WALL day. \nLetty jumps up. She slaps the paper on the wall with some paste. She motions for the students to join her. \nThe children slowly approach her. Zach lags behind. \nLETTY And, Zach? Zach, I want you to be in charge of paste. \nINT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nLetty lies in bed. The alarm clock BLASTS opera. Letty fumbles for the switch. She can't turn it off. She yanks out the cord. L Letty gets out of bed, walks to the dresser and turns off the second clock before it rings. She goes to the KITCHEN and snaps off the alarm, then heads down the HALLWAY and shuts that alarm off, as well. \nLetty hurries back to her BEDROOM and crawls into bed.   Paul, toweling his hair dry, walks in. \nPAUL What are you doing?    You're going to be late. \nLETTY I'm calling in sick. \nPaul sits on the bed and puts his hand to Letty's forehead. \nPAUL You don't have a fever. \nLETTY I don't feel like going to work today. \nPAUL Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late? \nLETTY It'll be OK. \nPAUL But what about that math project? \nLETTY Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime? \nPAUL Forget I asked. \nLETTY I'm sorry. (beat) I'm just...I'm so tired lately. \nPAUL Maybe you ought to see a doctor. \nLETTY No, it's not like that. \nLetty starts to cry. \nLETTY It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. (MORE) \nLETTY(cont'd) And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner. \nPAUL You can get out of the dinner. \nLETTY No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come. \nPAUL Come on, Letty.   It'll get done. \n", "test1_true": "LETTY I don't think so. \nPAUL Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off. \nLETTY Yeah. \nPAUL You just need to get more organized. L \nLETTY Maybe. \nPAUL Let's make a list of the things you need to do, OK? \nLetty nods her head, and Paul grabs a legal pad from his briefcase. \nINT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT \nMR. and MRS. ANDERSON, over-eager parents, sit across the desk from Letty, who stares at the legal pad in her lap. As the Andersons talk, Letty twists a lock of hair tighter and tighter. \nMRS. ANDERSON So at home, we've started our own little library for Chandra. \nMR. ANDERSON We thought it would be a good project for her to set up her own card-catalogue. \nLETTY I see. \nLetty tries unsuccessfully to extricate her hand from her hair. \nMRS. ANDERSON But what I'm wondering is whether we should also be spending more time on her computer skills at home. What do you think? \nLETTY Well... \nMR. ANDERSON Because we don't want her to get behind her classmates. \nMRS. ANDERSON And we trust your opinion. Chandra's always talking about Miss Mayer. \nLETTY Oh. \nMR. ANDERSON Just the other day she came home and told us about you taking care of her bloody nose. \nMRS. ANDERSON And she went on and on about the collage. That seems very inventive, Miss Mayer. \nLetty stares blankly at the couple. \nMR. ANDERSON Miss Mayer? \nLETTY What the fuck. It's my job. \nOff Mr. Anderson's raised eyebrow, we \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe room is a mess of scattered papers and the math Twister game. Letty sits on the ground crying. She makes a pyramid out of the wadded-up tissues that surround her. \nINT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY \nThe upscale shop is festooned with pastels and lace and lots of signs announcing \"Sale Day.\" Frenzied women pick through dresses as \"Pachelbel's Canon\" plays in the background. \nLetty is wedged into a corner, sipping coffee. A CLERK approaches her with a coffee pot and tray of pastries. \nCLERK More coffee? \nLETTY Hit me. \nCLERK Danish? \nLETTY (rooting through the tray) No more bear claws left? \nRuth bounces into the shop. \nCLERK (to Ruth) Danish? \nRUTH Oh, no thanks, I'm too excited to eat. \nThe clerk gives Ruth an approving smile as Letty rips into a sweet roll. Ruth looks through a nearby rack of gowns. \nRUTH (to Letty) Where's Mommy? \nLETTY Do you have to call her Mommy? \nRUTH Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy? \nLETTY She said she'd be here at 10. \nRuth pulls a dress from the rack and holds it up. \nRUTH What do you think of this one? \nLETTY I'd have to see it on. \n", "test2_input": "Thomas, who sits across the room, looks up from his book. \nMRS. MAYER (whispering) I'm only looking out for you. \nLETTY (yelling) And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke. \nLetty races out the door and into the garden. In the distance, Michael spots her and jogs over. Letty's mother watches them. Thomas approaches Mrs. Mayer. \nTHOMAS Mrs. Mayer, I'm sorry but I couldn't help overhearing. I just wanted to say, not that it's any of my business... \nMRS. MAYER Yes? \nTHOMAS I think, really, I think I'd go with the cream damask. I NT. REC ROOM - LATER \nLetty and Michael walk through the rec room toward the dining hall. Nurse Gates bends down in front of Mrs. Hallstrom, who sits where we last saw her. \nNURSE GATES It's OK to be upset. \nMRS. HALLSTROM (gaily) Upset? Why of course not. My goodness, no. I'm sure she just got hung up. \nLetty and Michael stop. \nMICHAEL Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa. \nMRS. HALLSTROM That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do. \nLETTY If you change your mind, we'll be in the dining hall. \nMichael and Letty walk on, exchanging a sad look. \nINT. DINING HALL - LATER \nMr. Santucci and Mrs. Santucci sit at the heads of the table. Letty sits between Rosa and Michael. \nROSA (to Letty) What do you need now? (to Mr. Santucci) Send down the lamb. This girl's as thin as a stick. \nLETTY Oh, no.   I'm stuffed. \nROSA Tell her to eat, Frank. \nMR. SANTUCCI Mangia.   Mangia. \nMICHAEL (whispering to Letty) You can't turn down Grandma Rosa's lamb. \nROSA Or my eggplant. I make the best eggplant in L.A. The mozzarella I use, it's so fresh it sweats. \nLetty heaps more food on her plate. \nMRS. SANTUCCI Michael says you're a teacher. \nLETTY I was. I'm hoping I'll still have a job when I get out. \nMrs. Hallstrom walks into the room, wearing her Christmas stocking cap. She starts to dispense erasers. \nLETTY What's she doing? \nMrs. Hallstrom, practically skipping, zeros in on Grandma Rosa. She hands Rosa the gift meant for her daughter. \nMRS. HALLSTROM Rosa, Rosa, you must have this, Rosa. \nROSA Grazie. \nMICHAEL Mrs. Hallstrom, join us. Please. \nBut, by this point, Mrs. Hallstrom's already bounded away, divesting herself of more and more erasers to bewildered parents and delighted children. \nShe clambers onto a table in the middle of the room. Marie gets up from another table and leaves the room to get help. \nMRS. HALLSTROM Merry Christmas to all. Ho, ho, ho, ho. \nLETTY Michael, we've got to stop her. \nMichael pushes back his chair.   He's trapped between the table and the wall. \nMRS. HALLSTROM My goodness, it's so very warm in here. So warm. \nShe takes off her cap and tosses it to a surprised looking man. But she doesn't stop there. With haphazard abandon, she begins to disrobe, first her blouse, then her skirt. \nMRS. HALLSTROM Way, way, way too warm for December. Now, let's sing Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the way... \nThe group looks on in horror, mesmerized by her behavior. Then, almost as one, the patients spring into action. \nMichael bolts over his dining table and runs to Mrs. Hallstrom. He jumps onto her table, trying to restrain the dancing woman so he can wrap his sweater around her. \nBy this time, John, Thomas and Letty have surrounded her in a protective enclave. Michael sets Mrs. Hallstrom on the ground. She looks up at the group, and continues belting out I \"Jingle Bells.\" \nNT. LINEN CLOSET - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nLetty and Michael lie on the floor next to each other, trading puffs on a cigarette. The glowing ember is the only light in the room. \n", "test2_true": "LETTY I just want to see Beast. (beat) Where would you go? \nMICHAEL The mission up in Santa Barbara. \nLETTY No way. \nMICHAEL That's where I always go when I get out. \nLETTY Why? \nMICHAEL My dad used to take me there when I was little. It's totally quiet. And you can see the ocean for miles. \nThey smoke for a while. \nLETTY What else would you do? \nMICHAEL I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper. \nLETTY And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can. \nMICHAEL How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight? \nLETTY I have a terrible confession. \nMICHAEL Tell the doctor. \nLETTY I don't like lamb. \nMichael sits up. \nMICHAEL Then it's over. \nLETTY Lie down. \nMichael lies down. \nMICHAEL It's a good thing my family loves you. \nLETTY Your family just met me. \nMICHAEL You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, \"It's a good thing I love you.\" \nLETTY Do you? \nMICHAEL I do. \nLETTY Michael, I... \nMICHAEL It's OK. You don't have to say anything. \nLETTY But I do.     I love you, too. \nMichael and Letty lie still, looking into each others eyes. \nINT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY P osters of Harry Houdini and Doug Henning.       Handcuffs and card decks all over. \nMICHAEL Your Honor, I feel I should be released. I'm sufficiently able to look after... \nMichael stops. His eyes glaze over.        His head darts toward the corner of the room. \nMICHAEL (to the corner) What? What? \nNothing's there.   Nothing at all.    But Michael keeps staring. \nA KNOCK on the door. Michael's eyes refocus.       He opens the door to find Letty. \nLETTY John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you. \nMICHAEL Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look? \nLETTY (straightening his tie) Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck. \nLetty hands him the Cracker Jack ring. \nINT. COMMITMENT COURT - DAY \nMichael sits near the front of the courtroom with half a dozen other patients from various institutions. \nNurse Gates sits a few rows back near JOHN'S MOTHER and Michael's family--Mr. and Mrs. Santucci and Grandma Rosa. \nJUDGE MILTON, 60s, questions John, who's on the stand. \nJUDGE MILTON Why have you petitioned to leave the institution? \nJOHN I haven't had an episode in more than a month, Sir. \nJUDGE MILTON How do you plan to support yourself? \nJOHN My family's helping me out, Your Honor. \n", "test3_input": "LETTY I love your apartment. \nMICHAEL Really? \nLETTY You'll never get rid of me. \nMichael kisses Letty on the lips. \nLETTY What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate? \nMICHAEL Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here. \nOff Letty's look of surprise, we watch Michael open a cupboard door. The shelves are filled from top to bottom with cans of Spaghetti-O's. \nLetty squeezes Michael in a bear hug. \nINT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nLetty, in a T-shirt, and Michael, in boxers, lounge on the futon. They watch both TVs -- one tuned-in to Jay Leno, the other to David Letterman. \nMichael eats from a can of Spaghetti-O's. Letty reaches over with her fork and snags a mouthful from Michael's can. \nLETTY How can you not like the Top 10 List? \nMICHAEL I like it.     But Headlines are better. \nLETTY You're so wrong. \nLetty takes her remote and increases the volume on her TV. As Letterman gets louder, Michael zaps his volume. \nIt's a war. Letterman then Leno get LOUDER and LOUDER and LOUDER until Letty makes a might lunge. She wrests Michael's remote from him. Letty MUTES both TVs. \nMICHAEL Hey. \nLETTY It's sex time. \nMichael mockingly checks his watch.    Letty climbs on top of him. Michael rolls on top of her. \nMICHAEL I think it's my turn. \nCLOSE on their faces as Michael gently licks the side of Letty's mouth. \nLETTY Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face? \nMICHAEL No. \nMichael licks Letty's nose. \nLETTY Michael. \nMICHAEL Shhhh. \nMichael and Letty look into each other's eyes, bathed in the blue light thrown off by the twin televisions. \nMichael places a pillow gently beneath Letty's head.    He caresses her face. \nLetty's eyes are alive to every look, every touch. Michael kisses her slowly on the forehead, the nose, and the lips. \nCLOSE on Letty's hands as she reaches up to stroke Michael's forehead and caress his temple. \nCLOSER on her hands as Letty runs them through Michael's hair, then twists a curly lock around her finger. \nSOFT MOANS as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCLOSE on Letty's hand, resting on the comforter on Michael's bed. The alarm clock RINGS. Letty's hand slaps it into submission. \nINT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - LATER \nLetty's still in bed, a look of bliss across her face. \nMICHAEL Letty?   Rise and shine. \nLETTY'S POV: \nMichael's face fills her vision. \nBACK TO SCENE: \nLetty's eyes close. \nLETTY Not yet. \nMICHAEL I'll be forced to tickle you. \nLetty opens one eye and glares at him. L LETTY Go away. \n", "test3_true": "Letty bolts upright. \nLETTY I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour. \nMICHAEL I'll see you tonight. \nMichael gives her a kiss and walks into the LIVING ROOM. \nMichael adjusts his tie. Letty, naked, runs into the room and throws her arms around his neck. \nLETTY Good luck. \nMICHAEL You, too. Kick ass today. \nMichael walks out the door. Letty thinks for a minute. She flings open the door and yells to Michael's retreating back. \nINT. HALLWAY - SAME \nLETTY My apartment tonight.   You can meet Beast. \nMichael swings around. \nMICHAEL Sounds good. Oh, and Letty? \nLETTY Yeah? \nMICHAEL (yelling) You've got one hell of a great body. \nThe door across the hall opens. A LITTLE OLD MAN stares at Letty's naked figure. She slams Michael's apartment door. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - SAME \nLetty collapses in GIGGLES. \nINT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY \nLetty sits across from the principal. \nPRINCIPAL GAIL I didn't have any choice but to include the parents' letters in your file. \nLETTY Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor. \nPRINCIPAL GAIL So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet. \nLETTY Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher. \nPRINCIPAL GAIL I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children. (beat) Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on... \nLETTY Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better. P RINCIPAL GAIL I'm glad you're doing well. \nLETTY I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was. \nLetty hands the principal a letter. \nLETTY And I'd like to send the parents this letter of explanation. With your support, I think they can accept me. \nThe principal reads the letter. \nPRINCIPAL GAIL It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students. \nLETTY What does that mean? \nPRINCIPAL GAIL I need someone to work on budget projections. \nLETTY Office work? \nPRINCIPAL GAIL Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nMichael sits at a back desk with MR. SMYTHE, who wears a three-piece pin-striped suit and taps a pencil on his knee. \nMR. SMYTHE It's not that we're doubting your intelligence, Mr. Santucci. But your work history shows so many interruptions. \nMICHAEL I know, but as I said... \nMR. SMYTHE I appreciate your candor about your illness, but my bosses are concerned. \nMICHAEL I can do the job. \nMR. SMYTHE Between you and me, my uncle, he has some mental problems, and I know what you're going through. If it were up to me, I'd hire you. \nMichael's already standing. \nMICHAEL Right.   Thanks for your help. \nHe shakes Mr. Smythe's hand, and, downcast, gets out of the bank as quickly as he can. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \n"}

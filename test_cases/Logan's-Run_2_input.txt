Logan and Jessica running through Arcade. 167X1	LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Suddenly she pulls him in another direction. 
JESSICA Follow me, Logan. Stay close. 
As they run into Hallucimill...Francis...never too far behind... spots them and follows. 
173 		OUT 
174		EXT. - HALLUCIMILL - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Exiting from the other side...and running through the crowd toward and into a Love Shop...followed by Francis coming out of the Hallucimill, too... and running toward the Love Shop. 
175		INT. - LOVE SHOP - LOGAN AND JESSICA As they enter the hot darkness. The Love Shop is throbbing with sexuality. In it, the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when booths and cubicles flare into brilliance, each time revealing an orgiastic tableau. The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random flashes may appear from any direction at any time, blinding and stunning the viewer. Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings and as they do, a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan, pulling and laughing: 
WANTON I have an empty one, Sandman 
Logan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time to see a man almost carrying her off.  Then the light is gone again and Jessica with it. 
176		LOGAN AND THE WANTON 
As she tears at his clothing, wrapping herself around him, trying to pull him down. Then, as the light flares again she suddenly lets go and grabs another man...Logan is, freed, starts looking for Jessica. 
179		SERIES OF SHOTS 
Logan hunting through the Love Shop, fighting them off. 
INTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus. Sex, manifold and multiform -- everybody doing it. 
180		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS 
Entering, starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing Wantons. 
181-182	LOGAN, JESSICA 
Brief glimpses of them looking for each other. 
183		FRANCIS 
Hunting both. 
184		WITH LOGAN 
As he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees it's Jessica. Now together they make for an archway where multiple mirrors enclose them. 
Suddenly they are in darkness. Then a heavy door slides open and Jessica leads Logan through the opening. Behind them the door slides shut again. 185		FRANCIS 
Desperately trying to get rid of a woman, sees a flash of Logan and Jessica far across the room -sees them leave. Then he's pulled down again as the orgy continues. 
186X1 	OUT 
186X2	INT. - AN IMMENSE METAL STAIRWAY 
After a moment, Jessica takes Logan's hand and they start down in the darkness. The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind the wall. 
LOGAN Are you taking me to them? 
JESSICA Yes. (beat) I don't know what else to do -- with him following us. (she hesitates) Why do you keep running from your-- 
LOGAN Because he's my friend - (a beat) and I don't want to be killed by him - or anyone. 
JESSICA He's good, isn't he? 
LOGAN Will he find us and kill us? Yes...or one of the others. (a beat) You know there's only one place to go now... 
JESSICA (hopelessly) They won't believe us. 
LOGAN (beat) I'd rather take my chances with them...than with Francis. 
JESSICA They wonÂ¹t listen. LOGAN (interrupting) You think Sandmen will? (before she can answer) There's no other way for me, 
JESSICA We'll convince them. 
They pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then she turns his hand over. The crystal blinks red -- on, off. 
JESSICA Yes, Logan. (turning to him blindly) I'm glad they didn't change your face. Logan embraces her, but his look is strange and remote. They continue down into the darkness. Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only their footsteps are heard. 
187 		OUT 187X1	FRANCIS At the mirrored archway, looking around carefully, testing. He knows they went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them away as he searches. 
188-200 	OUT 
200X1	WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA 
They have come to the foot of the stair. Here the flooring shines wetly in the darkness.

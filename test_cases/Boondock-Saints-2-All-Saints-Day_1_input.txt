EXT. RAPID FLASHBACK SEQUENCE, "ACCESSORY TO MURDER" 
Greenly, disguised as a correctional officer, lets Connor, Murphy and Poppa M out of a paddywagon. FLASH! 
The Saints enter the Suffolk Courthouse, undetected.   FLASH! 
Dolly, dressed as a civilian, pulls the fire alarm.    FLASH! 
The Saints execute Poppa Joe Yakavetta before many terrified witnesses, the alarm blaring in the b.g. FLASH! 
INT. BACK TO PRESENT, VESTIBULE -- MOMENTS LATER 
GREENLY ...and not just fucked, like elephant dick, pounded in the ass, no reach around, jungle fucked! 
DUFFY Now's not the time to panic, Green beans! 
GREENLY Oh, I disagree. Now's the perfect time to panic. We're all Accessories to... 
DOLLY Don't you fucking say it! 
They all argue over one another. OFFICER #1 peaks his head in the front door. The detectives grind to a halt. 
OFFICER #1 Her E.T.A. is ten minutes. 
EXT. GRAVEYARD -- MORNING 
CLOSE ON:   a gravestone.   "Paul M. Smecker,    1956 - 2003" 
We reveal a pair of sexy female legs, expensive "Jimmy Choo" heels. From behind we see the woman rest a rose at Smecker's Grave. "Legs" turns and walks toward a waiting squad car in b.g. 
EXT. CHURCH -- MOMENTS LATER 
Dolly, Duffy and Greenly stand outside in the entry way of the church. Though still on edge, they have calmed. 
DOLLY I didn't even know he had a protege. What is this bullshit? 
Duffy whips out his trusty note pad. 
DUFFY Special Agent Eunice Bloom, 32 years old. Smecker plucked her right out of class at Quantico. 
GREENLY Smecker hand picked her? Aw, man. This brawd's gonna be a nightmare. 
DUFFY She was assigned to OCD two years back. She can shoot a gun, set three course records during her training. 
GREENLY Great. A bull dike, Annie Oakley wanna- be. We gotta get rid of her. 
DUFFY She is also an authority on the Saints case. Which means Smecker must have walked her through it. 
The cops suddenly flush with fear. 
DOLLY And the hits just keep on comin'. 
INT. FARMHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
Sibeal waits as Poppa M thinks, then shakes his head. 
POPPA M Naw...I'm in no condition.   I'd just slow 'em down. 
SIBEAL Well, are ya at least gonna try ta talk them out of this? 
Poppa M shakes his head. 
SIBEAL (CONT'D) We don't even know what this is yet! Somebody could just be tryin' ta get away with murder here! 
POPPA M Aye. Only there's about a thousand easier ways ta do that. Trust me. Someone's callin' them out, Sibeal. Ya kill a priest in a church and make it look like they did it. Bring 'em back with a vengeance. Don't know who. Don't know why. But someone thinks he's real fuckin' clever. Only one problem with his little plan. 
SIBEAL What's dat? 
POPPA M It worked. 
Fear and frustration burst from Sibeal. 
SIBEAL Jesus Christ! D'er's too much we don't know and if you're won't at least try ta talk some sense into them, I will! 
The door opens and in comes Connor and Murphy. Sibeal notes the change in appearance. The boys stand at the kitchen table's opposing end, hands in their pockets. Their resolve fills the room. 
The brothers face off with Poppa M and Sibeal: a bizarre board meeting. Poppa M cocks a brow at Sibeal who clears his throat. 
SIBEAL (CONT'D) Exactly what do you intend to do? 
Silence. Nobody moves. Connor withdraws a hand from his pocket and looks down. He flips a penny on the table. It clatters to a stop. 
MURPHY Every last motherfucker that had anything to do with it. 
EXT. CHURCH -- LATER

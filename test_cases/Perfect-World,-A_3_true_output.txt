Gladys Perry, frazzled, somewhat in shock, is ushered forward. She's handed the MEGAPHONE. She fumbles with it, pushes the button. It SQUAWKS LOUDLY. RED Jus' push the button and talk normal. It SQUAWKS again. RED Here, I'll hold the damn thing. You jus' talk. GLADYS (into megaphone) Hullo... Hullo. Please, sir, he's my only son. I'll give you money, whatever I can. Please, I want to take my boy home! I want to... The MEGAPHONE SQUALKS one final dying time and SHORTS OUT. Red hands it to Bradley, who immediately sets it on the trunk and starts taking it apart. RED (to Gladys) Yer' doin' fine. We'll get another one. BRADLEY I think yer' tobacco spit shorted it out, Red. 206   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                          206 Phillip wears the mask.   Butch dusts him off and smiles. BUTCH You ready to go home? (CONTINUED) 
206   CONTINUED:                                                    206 PHILLIP (very sure) Yeahsir. BUTCH (yells) Hey, Cap'n, you got any candy? INTERCUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN Butch and: RED BRADLEY (re: megaphone) This one's shot. 
RED Well, find another one! Red sighs and cups his hands around his mouth. RED (yells) What?! BUTCH (yells) Candy! Halloween candy! Popcorn balls, caramel apples, gum, shit like that?! RED (yells) You hungry? BUTCH (yells) You find me some candy and I'll deliver up a ghost. RED (to Adler) You heard him. 207   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                           207 Red nods to Adler who starts to gather sticks of gum, mints, anything from the surrounding officers. BRADLEY Don't have another megaphone, Chief. Red just shakes his head and sighs. Bobby Lee leans on the hood of the car and places one eye behind the scope of his rifle. (CONTINUED) 
207   CONTINUED:                                                     207 RED You all set? BOBBY LEE You say when, I'll say dead. Red glares at Bobby Lee for an extended moment. RED (yells; to Butch) You got yer'self a deal. Candy's waitin'. 208   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                           208 BUTCH (yells) One more thing. His old lady has to swear to take him trick r 'treatin' every year. Phillip strains to look for his mom.    He's upset, ready to leave. BUTCH Gimme' yer' list, Phillip. PHILLIP Butch?... BUTCH Gimme that list. Phillip pulls it out. Butch snatches it and reads it to himself, laughing. He's on a death roll of sorts, between losing blood and being in an impossible situation he almost seems to be enjoying the macabre scenario as it unfolds. Phillip, on the other hand, is beginning to sob. BUTCH (yells) And she's gotta promise to take him to the fair for rollercoasters and cotton candy whenever he wants... or at least once a year... PHILLIP I wanna' go home!... BUTCH (checks list; yells) And when he gets older he gets to drink beer... (CONTINUED) 
208   CONTINUED:                                                   208 PHILLIP I don't need beer!... BUTCH (to Phillip) Well it's on yer' list. (yells to Red) And to go out on dates with girls! (to Phillip) Not on the list, but you'll thank me later for that little addition. (checks list) Done that, got to drive, gonna' ride that rocketship. That's about it. (yells; to Red) She's gotta' promise or I won't let him go! PHILLIP I wanna' go home, Butch. My mama's not bad! She gives me those things. BUTCH Don't kid a kidder, Phillip. 209   EXT. ROADSIDE -DAY                                           209 Red, exasperated, he can't believe how weird this has gotten. RED (yells) It's a deal! BUTCH (yells) Make her say it! Red looks to Gladys as if to say, "go ahead".   She seems reluctant. Red's frustration is showing. 210   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                         210 Phillip is near tears. He rises and starts to move for the field, but Butch grabs him with one arm, pulls him close and holds him like he's his own child. PHILLIP I jus' wanna' go home. BUTCH (sincere) Know jus' how ya' feel, Phillip. 
211   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                         211 GLADYS (to Red) Phillip knows those things are against our beliefs. RED (to Gladys) What kinda' foolishness is that? (yells) She promises! BUTCH (yells) Make her say it! 
Red gives her a look that says, "Say it or deal with me". GLADYS (yells) I promise! 212   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                        212 BUTCH (to Phillip) Can we trust her? PHILLIP She's a real good mama. Butch reaches into his pocket, extracts the remaining wad of stolen bills, unzips the Casper outfit, stuffs them into the costume and rezips. BUTCH (to Phillip) When you get home, hide this. If she's lyin' you can buy yer' own damn beer. Phillip quiets for a moment and stares at Butch. PHILLIP Yer' not bad, are you, Butch? BUTCH Yeah. (beat) Now, Buzz, listen here. I want ya' to step out there real slow, keepin' yer' paws in the air. Then strut right over to them cops and yell 'trick r' treat.' Got it? (CONTINUED)

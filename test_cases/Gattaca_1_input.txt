DETECTIVE HUGO (immediately protesting) You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days. (seeking a compromise) At least go with a fingertip sample or urine. 
INVESTIGATOR (shaking his head) Blood.  From the vein. 
The Investigator turns on his heel to prevent further protest. The Detective and his ASSISTANTS exchange looks of exasperation behind the Investigator's back. 
INT.  GATTACA.  DAY. 
JEROME, drinking water, stands in front of a large video bulletin board.  Among other things, it displays the electronic mugshot of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT alongside the recent computer generated age enhancement of his face. 
Some distance away, CAESAR, the elderly janitor, discusses the mugshots with a YOUNGER JANITOR. 
CAESAR Look like anybody to you? 
YOUNGER JANITOR Not to me. 
CAESAR Ugly sonofabitch though, isn't he? 
Jerome half-smiles, realizing that the conversation is for his benefit.  Having made it clear that they do not intend to expose their former colleague, the two janitors continue their rounds. 
Jerome crushes his paper cup.  Forgetting himself, he drops the cup into the wastebasket. 
INT.  CRAFT.  DAY. 
JEROME familiarizes himself with the interior of a spacecraft under the supervision of DIRECTOR JOSEF and the MISSION COMMANDER.  The screen that Jerome sits at is identical to the one he operates in the computer complex - displaying asteroid 951 Gaspra. 
DIRECTOR JOSEF --Somewhere in the dust of Gaspra is the key. (warming to his theme) Back to the beginning of the book--the life we became.  With the original building blocks who knows how far we can take "the godding". 
MISSION COMMANDER (wry smile) Even someone as advanced as Jerome will be last year's model by the time we're done. 
JEROME (smiling back) I wouldn't get your hopes up, Commander. 
Irene enters the craft. 
IRENE Excuse me, Mr Morrow.  The investigators have begun their testing. 
DETECTIVE JOSEF This is so inconvenient, Irene.  They can make an exception for Jerome. 
IRENE I'm afraid not. 
DIRECTOR JOSEF I apologize, Jerome. 
JEROME It's not yor fault, Director. (afterthought) If your predecessor were still around we may not be going to Gaspra at all. That's what I would call inconvenient. 
Jerome exits the craft with Irene. 
INT.  GATTACA CORPORATION - CORRIDOR.  DAY. 
A line of MALE GATTACA EMPLOYEES snakes out the door and down the corridor.  The INVESTIGATOR walks slowly down the line, trying to eyeball his suspect.  Concentrating on the shorter, dark-haired men in the line, he looks straight past JEROME. However, as the Investigator ignores him and walks by, we see a haunted look in Jerome's eyes. 
INT.  GATTACA - TESTING LAB.  DAY. 
Every available TECHNICIAN is working to accommodate the testing of the thousand or so PROGRAMMERS.  Twelve testing stations operate simultaneously.  A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE supervises each station.  JEROME reaches the head of the line.  He notes an exiting COLLEAGUE holding a cotton ball to his arm. 
A NURSE directs Jerome to LAMAR's testing station.  Lamar deposits the previous patient's labeled vial into a blood carousel under the watchful eye of a large DETECTIVE, clearly not relishing his assignment.  Jerome rolls up his sleeve. 
JEROME (referring to the table lined with syringes) What's with the plungers, Lamar?  What are you doing, opening a blood bank? 
The syringes are clearly not Lamar's idea. 
LAMAR (sarcastic) The gentlemen of law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods may have been compromised. 
Lamar inserts a fresh syringe into Jerome's arm.  As Lamar draws the blood, Jerome suddenly flinches and flexes his arm violently, causing the needle to bend and buckle, exiting the skin from a second puncture point. 
JEROME Damn!! 
Having pulled away from Lamar's grasp, Jerome withdraws the bent needle himself, blood still squirting from his vein.

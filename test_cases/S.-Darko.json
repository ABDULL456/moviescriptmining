{"test1_input": "COREY Thanks. \nShe tears open the cigarettes and lights one. Chris lights up one of his own, and notices Corey's hands are shaking. \nCHRIS Shouldn't you go back home? \nCOREY There's nothing for me to go home to. Trust me. \nCHRIS What about Sam's funeral? \nCorey looks conflicted, but she takes a harsh stance: \nCOREY What's the point? She's gone, that's it. Nothing's gonna change that... \nChris lets it go. \nCOREY (CONT'D) Is there a library around here? \nCHRIS (PUZZLED) Yeah... you need a book? \nCOREY Is it walking distance? \nCHRIS I can take you. \nCOREY I think I'd rather walk. \nEXT. STREET - AFTERNOON \nCorey and Chris stroll together along a quiet street. \nCHRIS So you guys were real close, huh. \nCOREY When I moved to Virginia Sam was like the only person I could even stand to talk to. \nCHRIS How long had you been plannin' your trip together? \nCOREY Not too long... kind of a last minute thing. It was good timing, `cause I don't like to stay in one place for too long, ya know? \nCHRIS Huh... \nCOREY I was really surprised when Sam wanted to come, actually. I just kinda brought it up one day, and she was down... \nCorey reflects for a beat. \nCOREY (CONT'D) If it wasn't for me, she'd still be alive right now. \nCHRIS You can't think like that. \nCOREY It's true, isn't it? \nChris doesn't respond. \nINT. LIBRARY, MICROFICHE RESEARCH BOOTH - AFTERNOON \nCorey and Chris sit before a screen in a cramped, dim booth near the back of the library. They stare at a MICROFILM ARTICLE from 1988 about DONNIE DARKO'S DEATH. \nCHRIS That was Sam's brother? \nCOREY Yeah. \nOn the screen is a PHOTOGRAPH of the DARKO HOUSE with many PEOPLE gathered in front of it. A JET ENGINE is being lifted away by a CRANE. \nCHRIS Her parents must be going through hell. \nCOREY Sam said once she wished it landed on her room instead of Donnie's. \nChris thinks on this. \nCHRIS I saw something on Sam's wrist the other night... it looked like a scar. \nCOREY She told me it was from some accident. Put her hand through a window or something. \nCHRIS Did you believe her? \nCorey doesn't answer. She pulls up ANOTHER ARTICLE, one that chronicles a MAN who was IMPALED BY A METAL PIPE with no known origin... \nA THIRD ARTICLE is about a LITTLE GIRL who was DECAPITATED BY A MANHOLE COVER that was inexplicably flying through the air... \nCHRIS (CONT'D) God... \nChris is horrified. Corey is totally engrossed. \nShe brings up a FINAL ARTICLE that tells the story of a BOY who was CRUSHED BY A DUMPSTER that fell from the sky. A PICTURE shows his legs sticking out from under it like the Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in Munchkinland. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) I don't understand why we're lookin' at this stuff. \n", "test1_true": "CHRIS I was pretty close too, but everything was all crazy. Whoever it was must've jumped out and took off. \nCOREY I found this book in Sam's backpack last night. There's a chapter where it talks about stuff like this happening. Like a guy being killed by an arrow that nobody shot, and a swordsmith getting killed by a sword he hadn't made yet. Unexplainable things, but it says there's a reason why they happen. \nCHRIS A book...? I don't get what your talkin' about. What was the reason? \nCOREY It didn't say. \nCorey thinks, trying to figure out the right way to express something... \nCOREY (CONT'D) Last night, and right before the accident, I saw... \nCHRIS What? \nCOREY Nothing. \nCorey sighs and turns back to the screen. \nCOREY (CONT'D) You already think I'm a freak show. \nINT. LIBRARY, FRONT DESK - AFTERNOON \nAs Chris and Corey are on the way out, they notice Jeremy Frame at the counter checking out a STACK OF BOOKS. \nIn putting them down, he accidentally drops half of them onto the floor. He looks frazzled as he begins to pick them up, and he scratches compulsively at his LEFT FOREARM... \nI/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nChris and Corey pull up to Dusty's auto repair shop in Chris' truck. \nThey get out and start to walk up to the garage, but they're cut off by the unchained PIT BULL -- it's growling and barking in a frenzy -- \nRUTH (O.S.) Darielle! \nThe dog heels at the sound of the voice, and Ruth bolts out of the house and takes her by the collar. She's got a bandage over a cut on her forehead. \nRUTH (CONT'D) Come to check on your car? \nCOREY Yeah... \nHearts still thumping in their chests, they follow Ruth into the garage... COREY'S CHEVROLET is parked in the same spot it was when she left it the other day. The hood is propped open. \nRUTH Randy's been a wreck since the accident. \nCHRIS He should be. He was driving around shit-faced and somebody got killed. \nRUTH You can just fuck off... \nShe gets right up in his face with such intensity that Chris retreats a step or two. \nRUTH (CONT'D) Prima donna motherfucker think your shit don't stink? \nCorey steps in: \nCOREY She's right... \nChris gives her a look. \nCOREY (CONT'D) I mean, there's nothing Randy could've done. \nRuth turns and goes into the house through a GARAGE ENTRANCE. \nRUTH I'll get my dad. \nThe door slams shut behind her, and Corey and Chris glance at each other... \nMomentarily, Dusty comes out, a partially eaten SANDWICH in hand. \nDUSTY Got some bad news for you... \nHe walks them over to the car, finishing off his sandwich and wiping his hands on his greasy jeans. \nDUSTY (CONT'D) Your engine seized up when your water pump blew. \nCOREY I need a new engine now? \nDUSTY I can get one in there for you. Cost you about fifteen hundred. \nCorey's face drops. \nCOREY I don't have anywhere near that much money. \nCHRIS That's probably as much as the car's worth. \nDUSTY I understand. But, I already ordered the water pump, and I'll have to get paid for my time. That comes to about three-hundred total. \n", "test1_id": 2370, "test2_input": "COREY This is cool. \nRANDY Thanks. \nRandy puts his hands on her hips, running them up her torso. Corey turns to face him... \nThey kiss... \n...and fall back onto the bed... \nINT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER - NIGHT \nA DIGITAL CLOCK on Randy's DESK shows 3:30 AM. There's a SLIGHT TREMOR and the numbers shift, changing briefly to 01:10:23:08, then back again to 3:30. \nCorey wakes suddenly from a nightmare. She sits up and looks around, remembering where she is. She discovers Randy asleep by her side. She finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside the bed and grabs her shirt... \n...after she pulls it on over her head, she freezes -- because Billy Moorcroft is standing right there in his BIRTHDAY HAT, staring at her. \nBILLY MOORCROFT Only one day left. \nCorey turns and looks down to Randy. He's still fast asleep. \nCOREY What am I supposed to do? \nAs soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery, liquid VECTOR SPEAR protruding from the center of her chest. \nBilly is now gone, but her SPEAR beckons her out of the room, elongating to illustrate her path. Corey is in awe... \nINT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nHer SPEAR leads her through the living room, and past the sleeping bodies of Mike, Jeff and Ruth. Following her path leads her to step on RUTH'S FOOT as she goes by... \nCorey doesn't even notice, but one of Ruth's eyes pop open as she treads out the door... \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nCorey follows Billy, who walks in the middle of the road about 15 yards ahead of her. The residential street is guarded by great, OLD TREES on either side. \nThe dark sky above starts to BEND and WARP, and a BUCKLE in space-time materializes. \nThere's a simultaneous flash of LIGHTING and sharp CRACK OF THUNDER, and Corey looks up to the VORTEX -- a massive, swirling MAELSTROM gapes open like a tunnel to the inter- dimensional realm of darkest night. \nThe VOID brightens, and ominous STORM CLOUDS and TORRENTIAL RAINS are visible within... \nCorey peers up into the MOUTH of it and sees DUSTY'S HOUSE AND AUTO REPAIR SHOP being doused and beaten by the STORM -- \nINT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - NIGHT \nIn contrast to the street, all is nearly SILENT in Dusty's garage. Corey watches as Billy moves along the perimeter WITHOUT SOUND, ghostly... JUMP CUTS and TIME CUTS. \nHer CHEVROLET sits in the bay. Some of the PARTS have already been harvested -- the CATALYTIC CONVERTER sits next to it on the floor. \nCorey approaches a UTILITY SINK next to a SHOWER in the corner... \nBILLY MOORCROFT You can do it. \nCOREY How? \nBILLY MOORCROFT It's easy. \nCorey focuses on the sink, and it begins to tremble. The pipes beneath it CREAK and MOAN. WATER starts to bubble up from the sink drain, also in the shower... \nBilly stands atop her car, watching her. His perpetually morose expression transforms into a smile. \nThe SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure. As Corey stares into the drain... WE PLUNGE DOWN INTO THE PIPE -- \nPOV OF TELEKINETIC ENERGY - INSIDE THE PIPE \nWe travel through meters and meters of DANK PIPING until we hit the WATER MAIN. There's a sound like a TIDAL WAVE CRASHING -- \nEXT. STREET/DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAWN \n-- WATER POURS out from under the garage door down to the street. PULL BACK TO REVEAL -- \nThe entire driveway and the street in front of the house are covered with water. FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE are gathered in front of the property. \nANGLE: DOWN THE STREET \nRuth runs toward her house. When she turns a corner and it comes into view, she stops dead in her tracks. Her face shows sheer terror -- \nBecause her father Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another policeman, OFFICER HINES... \n...the PIT BULL struggles against it's CHAIN, growling and barking frantically. \n...and Billy Moorcroft, half-naked, soaking wet and shivering, is wrapped in a blanket and being tended to by PARAMEDICS. \n", "test2_true": "Ruth keeps to the shadows and slinks toward a BACK DOOR... \nINT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, FOOT OF THE STAIRS - DAWN \nShe sloshes through four inches of water and skips up the stairs... \nINT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, RUTH'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nWithout turning on the lights, Ruth desperately rifles through her closet until she finds a SHOEBOX. \nInside it are several PLASTIC BAGS -- some filled with MARIJUANA, others with COCAINE... \nINT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAWN \nHands shaking, Ruth dumps a bag of coke into the toilet and flushes it. The WHITE POWDER disappears down the swirling SPIRAL OF CLOUDY LIQUID... \nBut the bowl doesn't refill. \nRUTH Shit! \nShe begins to stuff the other bags down her pants... \nEXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - DAWN \nHaving deposited Dusty in the back of the cruiser and shut the door, O'Dell's attention turns to an upstairs window of the house when he sees MOVEMENT. \nINT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MORNING \nRandy rolls over in bed, opening his eyes to the new day. He looks around for Corey, disappointed to find her gone. \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nCorey walks down an aisle of the department store. She finds Chris assisting a CUSTOMER. \nCUSTOMER I just checked aisle three. \nCHRIS They're there. At the front, by the Trapper Keepers. \nThe Customer moves off and Chris turns to find Corey standing beside him. \nCOREY I'm outta cigarettes. \nEXT. BEHIND THE DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nCorey waits behind the store until Chris comes out. She eagerly accepts TWO PACKS. \nCHRIS D'ya hear the news? \nCOREY What? \nCHRIS They found that Billy Moorcroft kid. He was at Dusty's house... \nCorey is floored. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Sick bastard had him locked up in the basement. I can't believe we were just over there yesterday. \nCorey can't help it... A grin spreads across her face. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) I guess he's gonna be okay- \nCOREY Everything's gonna be okay. \nCorey cuts him off, and Chris looks at her strangely. \nCOREY (CONT'D) I'm not crazy. I think everything's gonna be okay. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT \nCorey lays on her stomach in bed, studying The Philosophy of Time Travel. The book is open to: CHAPTER SIX - THE LIVING RECEIVER... The Living Receiver is chosen to guide the Artifact into position for its journey back to the Primary Universe. No one knows how or why a Receiver will be chosen... \nShe flips through the onion skin pages to: CHAPTER TEN - THE MANIPULATED DEAD... The Manipulated Dead are more powerful than the Living Receiver. If a person dies within the Tangent Dimension, they are able to contact the Living Receiver through the Fourth Dimensional Construct... \nCorey glances over at the CLOSET MIRROR and sees Billy's image reflected. She flips over and finds him standing at the foot of the bed, clad in the same garb as all her visions. \nCOREY I already saved you. \nBILLY MOORCROFT It's not over. \nHe points to the CLOSET MIRROR... She stares into her own reflection as BILLY'S DISAPPEARS. \nHER IMAGE starts to FADE as well, and then the SURFACE OF THE MIRROR TRANSFORMS into a three-dimensional vision of a PARK. The focus is a SWING SET... and one of the SWINGS in particular, which rocks slowly back and forth. Empty. Void of life. \nCOREY (CONFUSED) Why? \nINT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM/DEN - DAY \n", "test2_id": 2371, "test3_input": "MIKE What's a fuck-ass? \nEveryone cracks up, including Corey. Sam is humiliated. She backs away from the car, anger burning in her eyes. Randy revs the engine, expressing his will to take off. \nCOREY See ya later, Sam. \nSam says nothing, but watches as Randy's car peels off toward the intersection. She's confused and hurt, frozen to the spot where she's standing. \nAs Corey stares back at Sam from the car, her smile fades... \nINT. RANDY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nCorey turns to face the approaching intersection. Resolute. \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON \nChris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department store... \nHe checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke break. \nEXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON \nRandy's car is stopped at the red light. Sam strolls toward it ever so slowly. Jeff, Mike and Ruth gawk at her from the backseat. \nShe slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting herself to any more of their mockery... \nThe light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the intersection, making a left. Sam's still 10 or 15 feet away from stepping into the street... \nShe quickens her pace, almost there when -- \nKA-BOOM! \nFROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the jalopy hits on the front passenger side -- completely smashing it in -- \nSam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH... \nRandy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road. \nThe hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and skitters harmlessly across the intersection -- \nThe world goes SILENT. \nCHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE... \nWATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT USED TO BE... \nTHE JALOPY IS FLIPPED OVER ONTO ITS SIDE... \nSAM STANDS PEERING AT THE WRECKAGE... THE AREA OF THE CAR WHERE COREY WAS SITTING IS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT. SHE DROPS TO HER KNEES. \nINT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON \nSam signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, her eyes red and puffy from crying. O'Dell sits facing her. \nOFFICER O'DELL I just gotta ask you one more time... you're sure you didn't see a driver? \nSam shakes her head no, and he takes the statement from her. \nOFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) Well, we'll find him, one way or another. \nSam nods in acknowledgement. O'Dell sees how much this has traumatized her. \nOFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) Why don't you stop in and see Dr. Peters on your way out... right down the hall there. She'll give you somethin' to make you feel better. \nEXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON \nSam walks out of the police station and finds herself in the secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti- depressants... \nA pair of eyes peek out of the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom. He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle. He sees Sam, but she doesn't see him. \nSam wells up with emotion, about to breakdown, and Tom watches her with empathy. It looks as though he's about to go to her when something stops him -- Chris comes out the door. \nCHRIS You okay? \nSam is still too choked up to speak. Tom sneaks away unnoticed... \nINT. CHRIS' TRUCK - AFTERNOON \nSam sits in the passenger side of Chris' truck and cries and cries. Major emotional release. \nChris looks like he wants to say something, but doesn't have the words. \nI/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING \nChris and Sam pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've gone to get her prescription filled, and Sam has the BOTTLE OF PILLS in her hand. \n", "test3_true": "She doesn't respond. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) It's horrible... but sometimes these things can happen for a reason. Sometimes good can come of it... growth, ya know? \nSAM What the fuck are you talking about? \nSam's benumbed expression doesn't change, but her tone is caustic. \nCHRIS All I meant was, sometimes- \nSAM I know what you meant, and it's bullshit. When someone dies for no reason you can't just make one up to fill the void and make yourself feel better. It sucks, and it fucks everything up, but it doesn't mean shit beyond that. \nCHRIS I'm sorry, I- \nSAM You've obviously never lost anybody like I have, `cause if you did you'd already know that. \nChris doesn't try anymore. Sam immediately feels bad. \nSAM (CONT'D) Thanks for the ride. \nShe gets out of the car and slogs toward her room. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING \nSam swallows her PILLS with some water, and sits down on one of the full-size beds by her BACKPACK... \nShe reaches inside and pulls out THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow. As she studies the cover, her image is reflected by the CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS. \nThe angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for other objects in the room... and Sam's reflection is present in both of the panes. \nThe digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM... \nShe looks at the PICTURES OF HER FAMILY tucked away inside the book: Sam with her mother and father; Sam as a child with her sister and brother; an old photo of the whole Darko family together... \nTears come to her eyes as she focuses on an image of Donnie, and she puts them all down. She touches the SCAR on the inner part of her right wrist... \nShe then glances down and notices that the book is open to: CHAPTER NINE - REMNANTS. \nSAM Remnants... \nA portion of the text includes: Like Dreams that the Manipulated can have after journeys into Tangent or Fragmentary Universes, sounds and images may be transferred from one Tangent or Fragmentary Universe to another, as all corruptions exist on relative cosmic planes... \nEXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT \nSam wanders through the junkyard clad in her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH by her temple. \nSAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE JUNKYARD \nShe sees the junkyard as the phosphorescent DESTINY PLANE. DEAD CARS, MACHINERY and piles of SCRAP METAL glow as stationary objects within the complex grid. A PAIR OF RATS follow their VECTOR SPEARS as they shimmy up the side of a RUSTY TRACTOR... \nSam treads effortlessly through the darkness, past the heaps of junk toward the decrepit STORAGE SHACK marked by the CORRUGATED ROOFING... \nANGLE: STORAGE SHACK \nShe stands before the shack, having discovered Vietnam Tom. He squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter, and looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask -- \nHe wears on his face the SCULPTURE made of SCRAP METAL, which has been formed into the COUNTENANCE OF THE MONSTER BUNNY. \nSAM Hi, Tom. I like your new mask. \nTom trembles like the frightened animal he personifies as Sam runs her fingers down one of the LONG, METALLIC EARS, down to one of the SHARPENED INCISORS of the EVIL-LOOKING GRIN... \nSAM (CONT'D) Are you scared? \nAs this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes transparent, and the NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN can be seen sending ELECTRIC IMPULSES, in turn RELEASING NEUROTRANSMITTERS and exciting OTHER NEURONS... \nSAM (CONT'D) I know you can hear me... \nA PORTAL forms around the shelter like a giant cylinder, enclosing them. Tom rises, afraid... Sam takes his hand... \nThe PORTAL shrinks and squeezes the walls until they bend inward, then begin to CREAK and RUMBLE -- \nEXT. BENEATH OVERPASS - THE NEXT MORNING \nSam awakens to a fierce RUMBLING overhead. \nIt happens again, and when she looks around she realizes that she's underneath a highway overpass in BOXER SHORTS and a T- SHIRT, barefoot, lying on a FLAT AREA atop the CEMENT SLOPE that leads down to the road below. \nAlarmed by both the height and sanitation of her current position, she shifts her body and starts to slide down the SLOPE... \nOnce on even ground, she notices a brand new `95 BMW coming toward her. \nSAM Perfect... \nJeremy pulls up next to her and rolls down his window. \n", "test3_id": 2372}

{"train": "S. DARKO \nWritten by \nNathan Atkins \nSecond draft \nEXT. WHEAT FIELD - MORNING \nSAMANTHA DARKO (18) opens her eyes. She squints as the summer sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size. She sits up slowly, looks around... and finds herself in midst of an endless wheat field. \nSam is pretty and demure. Her coppery hair flows past her shoulders. Disoriented, she stands and gazes at the infinite golden shimmer. Amber waves of grain. Patches of forest in the distance. It's quiet. Serene. Beautiful... \nShe smiles, and starts walking. \nEXT. ARKANSAS HIGHWAY 40 - MORNING \nShe emerges at the shoulder of a rural stretch of highway in Arkansas. Adjacent to her position, on the other side of the deserted lanes, is a TRUCK STOP. \nEXT. TRUCK STOP - MORNING \nAmongst the TRACTOR-TRAILERS parked in the back lot is a white, late-80s model CHEVROLET CELEBRITY. Sam makes her way across the asphalt toward the vehicle... \nINT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - MORNING \nCOREY RICHARDSON (18) is asleep, curled up in the reclined driver's seat of the car. She awakens when Sam gets in on the passenger side and slams the door shut. \nCorey has the look of a typical rebellious teen: dyed hair, piercings, a little grungy. She rubs the sleep from her eyes, greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm. She finds a soft pack of CIGARETTES and lights one. \nCOREY What time is it? \nSAM Early... \nCorey adjusts her seat. She takes a long drag and chokes, then spits out the window. She starts the car... \nI/E. COREY'S CHEVROLET/HIGHWAY 40, VARIOUS - DAY \nCorey's car cruises along the flat, open road. She cranks up the VOLUME on the car's CASSETTE DECK, nodding her head to early-90s ALT. ROCK (suggestion: Into Dust, by Mazzy Star)... \nSam looks out the window at the passing scenery: FARMERS at work in the fields; a BILLBOARD advertising a local restaurant; ROADSIDE DITCHES filled with trash... \nShe fixates on a MINIVAN travelling in the slow lane. It contains the all-American NUCLEAR FAMILY: MOTHER, FATHER and three SIBLINGS, one of them being a YOUNGSTER. The Youngster makes a face at Sam as they pass by... \nINT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - LATER - DAY \nCorey glances at the CONTROL PANEL when she HEARS the engine start to RATTLE. She sees that the TEMPERATURE GAUGE has hit the red and her CHECK ENGINE LIGHT is on. \nCOREY Shit... \nEXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/COREY'S CHEVROLET - DAY \nBy the time they pull over on the side of the empty highway, steam billows out from under the hood. Sam gets out of the car to check on it while Corey remains behind the wheel. \nSam peeks under the hood, trying to clear the air of the steam. It sounds like someone is rhythmically TAPPING the inside of the engine with a hammer. \nSAM Turn it off. \nCOREY (poking her head out the WINDOW) What? \nSAM Turn off the car. \nCorey does so. \nSAM (CONT'D) Doesn't look too good... \nCOREY How do you know? \nSAM It smells funny. \nSam looks up when she HEARS a PICK-UP TRUCK coming toward them. Corey watches as she steps out to wave it down... \nThe pick-up pulls over ahead of them. CHRIS HOLT (24), a brawny, attractive young man, gets out. When Corey sees him she gets out too. \nSAM (CONT'D) Thanks for stopping. Our car's messed up. \nCHRIS What happened? \nCOREY My check engine light came on, then it just started smoking, and ticking and shit. \nAs Chris pokes around under the hood, Sam and Corey exchange looks. Chris pops opens the COOLANT CAP and burns his hand on the steam explosion. \nCHRIS (shaking it off) Blew your water pump. Can't drive it. \nCOREY Fuck me... \nCOREY Corey. \nSAM I'm Samantha. \nThey shake, and Corey seems at ease mingling with the strangers. Sam hangs back a little. \nCOREY One of you guys mind pickin' us up a bottle of something? \nRANDY I think I can manage that. What do you want? \nCOREY I don't know. Vodka, whiskey, whatever. \nCorey looks to Sam, who produces some cash. Randy takes the money and heads for the store. \nRANDY Be right back... \nAfter he's gone, there's an uncomfortable moment of silence in which Mike and Jeff ogle the girls mischievously. Ruth stares at them in a different way. She seems somewhat resentful of their presence. \nRUTH From Virginia, huh? \nCOREY Yep. \nRUTH I saw your plates... \nCorey and Sam both nod in mundane acknowledgment. Another beat of uncomfortable silence. \nRUTH (CONT'D) Where to? \nCOREY What? \nRUTH Your obviously just passin' through here. \nSAM We're on the way to Vegas. \nRuth snickers. \nRUTH Well... you need anything besides booze, you just lemme know. \nRandy comes out of the store with a bottle in a brown bag. He passes it off to Corey, along with some change. \nCOREY Thanks a lot, man. \nRANDY No problem. You guys wanna come back to my place for bit? Bring your bottle, we got some weed... \nCorey looks like she's considering it, but -- \nSAM I'm really tired. \nShe takes Sam's signal. \nCOREY Yeah, I think we'll just head back. Been a long day, ya know? \nRANDY That's cool. \nEXT. BANK - LATER - NIGHT \nThe clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to -- JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29 MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS... \nINT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT \nSam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed. \nTWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed. There's a digital CLOCK/RADIO that reads 3:30 AM. \nThe TV is on, and a late night INFOMERCIAL for the GEORGE FOREMAN GRILL plays. Sam stares at the screen as the images WARP and RIPPLE in a way that coincides with an increasingly loud, rumbling TREMOR from outside... \nIn a daze, she gets up and slowly walks closer to the television. She reaches out with her RIGHT HAND, about to touch it... A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO: \nEXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - NIGHT \nSam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from the building. She wears a HOODED SWEATSHIRT, JEANS, and her RIGHT HAND is wrapped in some sort of MAKESHIFT BANDAGE. \nThere's a GASH in the side of her forehead by her temple, with what looks to be a SHARD OF METAL partially embedded under the skin and protruding from the wound. \nShe is without expression, and her movements are rhythmic and fluid. A tall AERMOTOR WINDMILL towers in the distance... \nSAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE GRASSY FIELD \nA glimpse of the field through Sam's eyes shows a phosphorescent PLANE OF DESTINY -- an intricate grid in which objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions, and move according to a framework of set paths. \nA JACKRABBIT follows a silvery VECTOR SPEAR like prophetic life-gel to its burrow... COSMIC ENERGY burns around a CLUSTER OF STONES... Miniature VECTOR SPEARS lead a SWARM OF INSECTS around in a circle and then BUZZING right past Sam's field of vision... \nIt's infinitely complex, but Sam sees through it clearly. She has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is cognizant of her path... She moves toward the WINDMILL. \nEXT. WINDMILL - NIGHT \nFRANK That whack job Tom's been squattin' up there the last couple a' months. Thinks he's the goddamn town watchman... (BEAT) You think he got blown up? \nEveryone scans the ground for signs of human remains until Phil pipes up: \nPHIL I saw him out in front of the motel early this morning, alive and well. \nFRANK (SARCASTIC) Oh, well, thank heavens... \nSam turns and peers up at the WATER TANK. It's marred by BURN MARKS and DENTS from the explosion. As she tilts her head and looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin... \n...in the form of a bizarre, toothy-grinned FACE OF A GIANT MONSTER BUNNY. \nEXT. MOTEL - MORNING \nSam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when they turn and see that Chris has followed them. \nCHRIS Hey... \nSAM Hey. \nCHRIS So you guys stayed here last night? \nCOREY One of us did. \nSam gives Corey a look. Chris decides to ignore the comment. \nCHRIS What's up with your car? \nCOREY It's gonna take a couple days. \nCHRIS For a water pump? \nSam and Corey shrug. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) None of my business, but... \nHe's distracted when a brand new `95 BMW pulls up and parks nearby. JEREMY FRAME (25), a thin, pale young man hops out and hustles into the field toward the crash site. \nSAM What? \nChris regains his train of thought: \nCHRIS I was just gonna say, if you wanted, I could give you a ride back. \nHe looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over at Corey, as if just remembering she was there. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) You too. I mean, I could give you both a ride. \nCOREY To Middlesex, Virginia? Do you have any clue how far that is? \nCHRIS (SHEEPISH) I got some time... \nSam looks as though she's about to say something but Corey overpowers her. \nCOREY We're not goin' back. Even El Reno's better than there. \nChris makes eye contact with Sam again. She maintains it for a moment and then looks away. \nEXT. JUNKYARD - DAY \nVietnam Tom explores a cluttered junkyard, gathering materials. He scours amongst the PILES OF REFUSE, RUSTY MACHINES and crumbling STORAGE SHACKS. \nHe bends to pick up a SCRAP OF METAL and adds it to a collection he's making in a worn SATCHEL... \nEXT. DINER - DAY \nAs Sam and Corey are about to enter the diner, Trudy Potter, a bank teller, is on her way out. \nThe girls move to the side so she can exit, and take notice of a MISSING PERSONS SIGN posted next to the door -- BILLY MOORCROFT'S (10) dark, empty eyes stare at them from the BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPH. \nTRUDY (O.S.) Isn't that just awful? \nTrudy has stopped and is looking over their shoulders. \nTRUDY (CONT'D) His poor mother... \nINT. DINER - DAY \nThe girls sit at a booth, sipping Cokes. \nCOREY How much money do we have left? \nSAM Not a whole lot. \nCOREY I can't believe your fucking parents wouldn't give you anything. \nEXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON \nVietnam Tom crouches in a decrepit SHACK covered by a piece of CORRUGATED ROOFING. He works with great focus, arranging VARIOUS BITS OF METAL into some sort of small SCULPTURE... \nEXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON \nHaving finished their ice creams, the girls pass the liquor store on the way back to the motel. They find Randy, Ruth, Jeff and Mike at their usual post. \nRANDY Hey, what's up? \nCOREY Not much... just getting stared down by creepy priest boy back there. \nJEFF Father Homeijer? \nMIKE Don't worry, you're a little old for his taste. \nJEFF Yeah, he's a fuckin' perv. \nCOREY (to Randy) You got an extra cigarette? \nRandy takes a pack from his pocket and offers her one. \nRANDY I'm throwin' a big party at my house tonight, you guys should come by. No excuses this time... \nSam and Corey look at each other, considering. \nRANDY (CONT'D) You're gonna be stuck in El Reno, you might as well have some fun, right? \nEXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT \nThe party at Randy's teems with LOCALS, ages ranging from early teens to late-20s. On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC. There's a slimy-looking POOL, and a few people swim in the greenish water. \nRandy and Ruth make their rounds as a pair. They stop off so Ruth can sell a BAG OF WEED to some eager KIDS. Corey and Sam hang with Mike and Jeff, drinking beer. \nCOREY You guys gotta come visit the club when we get all set up. We'll give you the VIP treatment, man... \nMike and Jeff are both excited about this proposition. \nMIKE Sounds good to me. \nCOREY Give us a little time, me and Sam'll be runnin' that place, no doubt... right? \nSAM Yeah. Definitely. \nCorey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam appears more out of place. She drains the better part of her cup for some liquid courage. \nRandy and Ruth converge back on the group just as Officer O'Dell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes. Ruth notices him first. \nRUTH Fuck. \nRANDY What? \nRUTH That pig, O'Dell. \nRANDY Don't worry about Ryan. He might be a cop, but he still likes to party. \nRandy's theory is proven when O'Dell takes a FLASK from his pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of TEENAGE GIRLS... But Ruth is still not satisfied. \nRUTH I think that asshole knows I deal. You know how fucked that is? \nRANDY From what I hear he's got a little somethin' goin' on the side himself. \nRUTH Fucking pig's a pig. \nThey're all distracted when somebody does a cannonball into the pool and splashes them. \nMIKE                               JEFF Fuck!                            Bastard! \nSAM What the hell... \nSam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants. Ruth watches her, smirking. \nRANDY We might as well all go in now, we're already wet. \nRUTH Good idea... \nWithout warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool -- \nANGLE: BENEATH THE WATER \nShe sinks into the murky water in SLOW-MOTION. All SOUNDS are DROWNED OUT and everything is tranquil, completely detached. \nThrough her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's PORCH LIGHTS glimmering beyond the surface of the water... TRANSITION TO: \nINT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Sam, wait... hey, come on... \nEXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nSam finds a STOOP at the side of the house where she can be alone. She can HEAR the PARTY going on in the backyard, but no one else is in sight. \nStill soaking wet, she plants herself on the stoop and starts to pound the rest of her drink... \nA strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO: \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF RANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nSam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's. A lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an orange glow. \nShe is completely dry, wearing her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH in her forehead... \nA CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form, missing her by inches. She sits up slowly and looks toward the front of Randy's house, which is about 20 yards away. \nSAM'S LUMINOUS POV - DRUNK GUYS \nTwo DRUNK GUYS exit the house and enter the complex, phosphorescent grid that is Sam's field of vision. VECTOR SPEARS jut from their chests and precede all their movements as they open the gas tank of a PARKED CAR, insert a SIPHON, and begin to drain the gas into ANOTHER VEHICLE. \nDRUNK GUY #1 Hurry up... \nAlthough she is close by, they take no notice of Sam whatsoever. ANOTHER CAR speeds by, again nearly crushing her, but she doesn't flinch... \nShe stands, and turns deliberately to face the opposite side of the road where, unlike the Drunk Guys, there is someone who is completely focused on her -- Vietnam Tom crouches in a DITCH near a CULVERT -- \nANGLE: CULVERT \nSam appears with him in the tenebrous ditch. Tom stares at her wide-eyed through the eyeholes of his ski mask. \nFrom one end of the broad, open culvert they can see straight through to the other side... \nA PORTAL starts to take shape within, swirling around the circumference. Soft, BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the phosphorescent glow, and a gust of WIND is nearly strong enough to make them falter. \nOn the opposite end of the culvert, a PLATE OF WHITE LIGHT flashes for an instant then transforms into an image of FATHER HOMEIJER'S CHURCH -- \nEXT. CHURCH - NIGHT \nTom and Sam stand outside the church. The STEEPLE reigns over them. Sam is stoic as she watches Tom climb the STONE STEPS and approach the great WOOD DOORS... \nINT. CHURCH - NIGHT \nSam sits like a statue in one of the PEWS. Tom strides past her in a daze, moving toward the PULPIT... \nBeside the ALTAR stand THREE BARE CROSSES in imitation of Calvary, each standing over 4 feet tall. \nSam looks up to a HIGH CORNER, above the pulpit to the right, where two walls and the ceiling meet... \nSAM'S LUMINOUS POV - CONVERGENCE POINT \nThe three planes come together at an irregular angle, with the WALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE SLANTING INWARD, and the CEILING SLOPING SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD. \nPHOSPHORESCENCE burns in the three queerly pitches lines, with a concentration of heightened energy at the juncture. \nA VECTOR SPEAR bulges from Vietnam Tom's chest where he stands below it, reaching higher and higher... \nAs Tom's SPEAR gets closer to the convergence point, the BIZARRE ANGLING becomes more exaggerated because the planes start to DIP and SWELL with impossible elasticity -- \nANGLE: BETWEEN THE WALLS \nSam and Tom find themselves squeezed between the inner and outer walls. Claustrophobic, dusty and obscure. \nDilapidated WIRING snakes around them, and Tom barely has enough space to reach forth and touch it with his finger... \nCOSMIC ENERGY jolts through the WIRE. A SPARK. A BLUE FLAME... \nHeat and pressure build. The old dry wood begins to CREAK and SNAP -- FADE TO WHITE. \nOVER WHITE... \nThe SHARP SOUNDS echo and fade away... then become present again. Louder now, and different. A BANGING... \nINT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - THE NEXT DAY \nSam pulls back the CURTAIN OF WHITE -- a SHEET over her face. She's lying on the floor of the motel room in between the beds. \nShe's alone, and naked except for the sheet. Her WET CLOTHES are in a heap beside her. Her head is throbbing... \nBANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! \nShe scrambles to put something on so she can get the DOOR... \nI/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nJEREMY (CONT'D) So what are you up to? \nSAM Trying to get money... not very successfully. \nJEREMY I've gotta pick up some cash too. Need some supplies for the lab. I don't think I've even slept since I got my hands on that meteorite. You should come by the lab with me and check it out. \nSAM I can't... \nSam starts to walk away from him. \nJEREMY I could let you borrow some money... if you need some. \nSAM I don't even know you. \nJEREMY That's okay. I trust you. \nSAM Thanks anyway. \nJEREMY You're sure you don't want to check out the lab? \nSAM Sorry... I've gotta find Corey. \nSam turns to leave. \nJEREMY Maybe some other time. \nI/E. RANDY'S CAR - AFTERNOON \nCorey rides shotgun in Randy's car, chewing on some greasy FAST FOOD, looking quite content. Randy is behind the wheel with a BEER in his hand, and Mike, Jeff and Ruth are packed into the back, passing around a JOINT. \nMIKE How many cheeseburgers did we get? \nRUTH Like eight. \nMike passes the joint up to Corey and she takes a big hit, chases it with some beer... \nJEFF Wait, did we get smokes? \nEveryone in the car is stunned into momentary silence when they turn a corner and see what's left of the church. \nMIKE                            RANDY Whoa!                           Jesus Christ... \nPOV FROM THE CAR - THE CHURCH RUINS \nPOLICE and FIREMEN swarm. Father Homeijer stands with Officer O'Dell, gazing at the soggy ruins. The only things standing amid the charred mess are the THREE BARE CROSSES of Mount Calvary. But they aren't completely intact -- \nEXT. CHURCH RUINS - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - DEFORMED CROSSES \nAll three are bent drastically forward, sagging down toward the murky ground... \nOFFICER O'DELL (O.S.) Musta' melted from the heat. \nFather Homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis, beside himself with bitterness and sorrow. \nFATHER HOMEIJER They're made of silver-plated steel. A simple fire couldn't do that. \nOFFICER O'DELL What are you sayin'? \nFATHER HOMEIJER This is an extension of Satan's own hand... I've seen it coming. \nRolling his eyes, O'Dell walks away, leaving the priest to grieve for his church in private. \nEXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON \nVietnam Tom continues to toil over his SCULPTURE, but progress has been made... \nIt has begun to take on a recognizable form: a GROTESQUE COUNTENANCE with TWO LONG EARS, BULGING EYES and a devilish, TOOTHY GRIN... \nEXT. RANDY'S CAR/STREET IN FRONT OF DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON \nSam is walking in front of a DEPARTMENT STORE when Randy's car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the passenger side window. \nCOREY What happened to you? \nSAM What happened to me...? Where the hell've you been? \nCOREY I crashed at Randy's. We just got food. Want a burger? \nSAM My stomach's fucked up. \nJEFF                             MIKE Awww...                         Poor tummy... \nJeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers. \nSAM (CONT'D) We gotta talk about what we're gonna do. \nINT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON \nCorey signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, the expression of shock still glued to her face. O'Dell sits facing her. \nOFFICER O'DELL You're sure you didn't see a driver? \nCOREY No... \nHe takes the statement from her. \nOFFICER O'DELL Well, you're one lucky girl to have gotten outta the car when you did. Front passenger side was wiped right out. Coulda' been two dead girls today instead of one. \nCorey nods, taking this in. \nOFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) I talked to Randy and sent him home a little while ago. He's pretty shook up. \nCorey doesn't respond. O'Dell leans in to speak to her in confidence. \nOFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) Both of us know he'd been doin' some drinkin' today. But we also know he's not at fault here. That old beater cut right in front him. \nCOREY Can't you just look up the license plates? \nOFFICER O'DELL No plates on the vehicle. We're investigating the VIN, but that could take a little more time, depending on the history of ownership. We'll find him. \nCorey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject: \nCOREY What about the missing boy? \nO'Dell shifts in his chair. \nOFFICER O'DELL You really think it was him, huh? \nCOREY He was on the side of the road right before the accident. \nOFFICER O'DELL I'm no psychiatrist, but I do know sometimes shock does funny things... \nCOREY You think I was hallucinating? \nOFFICER O'DELL We were on the scene five minutes after the accident. I think somebody woulda noticed a little boy wandering around. \nHe sees how troubled Corey is. \nOFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) Why don't you stop in and see Dr. Peters on your way out... right down the hall there. She'll give you somethin' to make you feel better. \nCorey nods and gets up to leave. As she's on her way out, O'Dell's voice stops her. \nOFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) Oh, uh... is there anything you wanted to say to Samantha's parents? \nCorey's expression is blank. \nCOREY Like what? \nEXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON \nCorey walks out of the police station and finds herself in a secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti- depressants. \nShe is frightened when she notices a PAIR OF EYES staring at her from the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom. He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle. \nCorey backs away as Tom slowly creeps toward her... She's about to scream for help when Chris Holt comes out of the police station behind her. \nCHRIS Get the hell outta here. \nGrateful for his presence, Corey moves to stand behind Chris. Tom shuffles away. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Should know better than to be carrying his rifle around town like that... \nCorey takes a breath, recovering from her scare. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) You okay? \nCOREY What're you doing here? \nCHRIS I had to put in a statement too. Can I give you a lift? \nI/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING \nChris and Corey pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've gotten Corey's prescription filled, and she has the BOTTLE OF PILLS in her hand. \nCHRIS I'm real sorry about Sam. \nCorey nods. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) It's such a waste. Just a horrible, freak thing. \nCOREY I said some pretty shitty things to her right before it happened. \nCOREY Thanks. \nShe tears open the cigarettes and lights one. Chris lights up one of his own, and notices Corey's hands are shaking. \nCHRIS Shouldn't you go back home? \nCOREY There's nothing for me to go home to. Trust me. \nCHRIS What about Sam's funeral? \nCorey looks conflicted, but she takes a harsh stance: \nCOREY What's the point? She's gone, that's it. Nothing's gonna change that... \nChris lets it go. \nCOREY (CONT'D) Is there a library around here? \nCHRIS (PUZZLED) Yeah... you need a book? \nCOREY Is it walking distance? \nCHRIS I can take you. \nCOREY I think I'd rather walk. \nEXT. STREET - AFTERNOON \nCorey and Chris stroll together along a quiet street. \nCHRIS So you guys were real close, huh. \nCOREY When I moved to Virginia Sam was like the only person I could even stand to talk to. \nCHRIS How long had you been plannin' your trip together? \nCOREY Not too long... kind of a last minute thing. It was good timing, `cause I don't like to stay in one place for too long, ya know? \nCHRIS Huh... \nCOREY I was really surprised when Sam wanted to come, actually. I just kinda brought it up one day, and she was down... \nCorey reflects for a beat. \nCOREY (CONT'D) If it wasn't for me, she'd still be alive right now. \nCHRIS You can't think like that. \nCOREY It's true, isn't it? \nChris doesn't respond. \nINT. LIBRARY, MICROFICHE RESEARCH BOOTH - AFTERNOON \nCorey and Chris sit before a screen in a cramped, dim booth near the back of the library. They stare at a MICROFILM ARTICLE from 1988 about DONNIE DARKO'S DEATH. \nCHRIS That was Sam's brother? \nCOREY Yeah. \nOn the screen is a PHOTOGRAPH of the DARKO HOUSE with many PEOPLE gathered in front of it. A JET ENGINE is being lifted away by a CRANE. \nCHRIS Her parents must be going through hell. \nCOREY Sam said once she wished it landed on her room instead of Donnie's. \nChris thinks on this. \nCHRIS I saw something on Sam's wrist the other night... it looked like a scar. \nCOREY She told me it was from some accident. Put her hand through a window or something. \nCHRIS Did you believe her? \nCorey doesn't answer. She pulls up ANOTHER ARTICLE, one that chronicles a MAN who was IMPALED BY A METAL PIPE with no known origin... \nA THIRD ARTICLE is about a LITTLE GIRL who was DECAPITATED BY A MANHOLE COVER that was inexplicably flying through the air... \nCHRIS (CONT'D) God... \nChris is horrified. Corey is totally engrossed. \nShe brings up a FINAL ARTICLE that tells the story of a BOY who was CRUSHED BY A DUMPSTER that fell from the sky. A PICTURE shows his legs sticking out from under it like the Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in Munchkinland. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) I don't understand why we're lookin' at this stuff. \nCOREY I don't have that much either. \nDusty is perturbed. \nDUSTY You think I do this for charity? \nCHRIS You didn't do anything. What's she want a water pump for if she doesn't have an engine? \nDUSTY I see how it is... couple a' punks. You don't plan to pay what you owe, you can get the hell off my property right now. \nCorey glares at him, furious, but Chris takes her by the arm. \nCOREY (under her breath) Asshole. \nCHRIS Let's go... \nI/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - AFTERNOON \nChris' truck pulls up in front of the motel and parks. At the same time, Father Homeijer and Trudy come out of the FRONT OFFICE carrying a COLLECTIONS JAR. \nAs they approach the truck Chris slowly rolls down the window. \nFATHER HOMEIJER Good afternoon. \nTRUDY We're taking collections to help rebuild Mount Calvary after the tragic fire. \nFATHER HOMEIJER Any small amount you could manage would really help. \nCHRIS Sorry. \nFather Homeijer and Trudy look over to Corey in the passenger seat but she just stares back at them. \nFATHER HOMEIJER God bless you. \nThey turn and walk away, and Chris rolls his window back up. \nCHRIS Everybody wants somethin'... \nCOREY What about you? \nCHRIS What do you mean? \nCOREY You wouldn't give me stuff and drive me around if you didn't want something in return. \nCHRIS Why not? \nCOREY `Cause that's just not how it works. \nCHRIS Maybe you're wrong about that. \nCorey nods, but still doesn't believe him. \nCOREY See ya. \nShe gets out, and Chris eyes her as she walks to her room. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT \nCorey lays on her stomach in bed, her head buried in The Philosophy of Time Travel book. The TELEVISION is on in the b.g. (out of focus), playing a repeat of the FOREMAN GRILL INFOMERCIAL... \nSuddenly, there is a slight TREMOR from outside and RIPPLE runs over the TV screen. \nCorey looks around, taking no notice of the odd change on the television -- instead of GEORGE FOREMAN'S VOICE, HULK HOGAN is HEARD promoting the brand new HULKSTER GRILL... \nJust then, there is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up to answer it and finds Randy -- he looks distraught. \nRANDY Do you hate me? \nCOREY Huh? \nRANDY You think it's my fault she's dead. \nCOREY No... \nRANDY You mean it? \nCOREY Yeah... it wasn't your fault. \nRandy sighs as if a big weight has been lifted. \nRANDY What's that? \nCorey looks down and realizes that she's still holding The Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand. \nCOREY Oh, it's just... something of Sam's. \nCOREY This is cool. \nRANDY Thanks. \nRandy puts his hands on her hips, running them up her torso. Corey turns to face him... \nThey kiss... \n...and fall back onto the bed... \nINT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER - NIGHT \nA DIGITAL CLOCK on Randy's DESK shows 3:30 AM. There's a SLIGHT TREMOR and the numbers shift, changing briefly to 01:10:23:08, then back again to 3:30. \nCorey wakes suddenly from a nightmare. She sits up and looks around, remembering where she is. She discovers Randy asleep by her side. She finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside the bed and grabs her shirt... \n...after she pulls it on over her head, she freezes -- because Billy Moorcroft is standing right there in his BIRTHDAY HAT, staring at her. \nBILLY MOORCROFT Only one day left. \nCorey turns and looks down to Randy. He's still fast asleep. \nCOREY What am I supposed to do? \nAs soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery, liquid VECTOR SPEAR protruding from the center of her chest. \nBilly is now gone, but her SPEAR beckons her out of the room, elongating to illustrate her path. Corey is in awe... \nINT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nHer SPEAR leads her through the living room, and past the sleeping bodies of Mike, Jeff and Ruth. Following her path leads her to step on RUTH'S FOOT as she goes by... \nCorey doesn't even notice, but one of Ruth's eyes pop open as she treads out the door... \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nCorey follows Billy, who walks in the middle of the road about 15 yards ahead of her. The residential street is guarded by great, OLD TREES on either side. \nThe dark sky above starts to BEND and WARP, and a BUCKLE in space-time materializes. \nThere's a simultaneous flash of LIGHTING and sharp CRACK OF THUNDER, and Corey looks up to the VORTEX -- a massive, swirling MAELSTROM gapes open like a tunnel to the inter- dimensional realm of darkest night. \nThe VOID brightens, and ominous STORM CLOUDS and TORRENTIAL RAINS are visible within... \nCorey peers up into the MOUTH of it and sees DUSTY'S HOUSE AND AUTO REPAIR SHOP being doused and beaten by the STORM -- \nINT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - NIGHT \nIn contrast to the street, all is nearly SILENT in Dusty's garage. Corey watches as Billy moves along the perimeter WITHOUT SOUND, ghostly... JUMP CUTS and TIME CUTS. \nHer CHEVROLET sits in the bay. Some of the PARTS have already been harvested -- the CATALYTIC CONVERTER sits next to it on the floor. \nCorey approaches a UTILITY SINK next to a SHOWER in the corner... \nBILLY MOORCROFT You can do it. \nCOREY How? \nBILLY MOORCROFT It's easy. \nCorey focuses on the sink, and it begins to tremble. The pipes beneath it CREAK and MOAN. WATER starts to bubble up from the sink drain, also in the shower... \nBilly stands atop her car, watching her. His perpetually morose expression transforms into a smile. \nThe SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure. As Corey stares into the drain... WE PLUNGE DOWN INTO THE PIPE -- \nPOV OF TELEKINETIC ENERGY - INSIDE THE PIPE \nWe travel through meters and meters of DANK PIPING until we hit the WATER MAIN. There's a sound like a TIDAL WAVE CRASHING -- \nEXT. STREET/DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAWN \n-- WATER POURS out from under the garage door down to the street. PULL BACK TO REVEAL -- \nThe entire driveway and the street in front of the house are covered with water. FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE are gathered in front of the property. \nANGLE: DOWN THE STREET \nRuth runs toward her house. When she turns a corner and it comes into view, she stops dead in her tracks. Her face shows sheer terror -- \nBecause her father Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another policeman, OFFICER HINES... \n...the PIT BULL struggles against it's CHAIN, growling and barking frantically. \n...and Billy Moorcroft, half-naked, soaking wet and shivering, is wrapped in a blanket and being tended to by PARAMEDICS. \nMIKE What's a fuck-ass? \nEveryone cracks up, including Corey. Sam is humiliated. She backs away from the car, anger burning in her eyes. Randy revs the engine, expressing his will to take off. \nCOREY See ya later, Sam. \nSam says nothing, but watches as Randy's car peels off toward the intersection. She's confused and hurt, frozen to the spot where she's standing. \nAs Corey stares back at Sam from the car, her smile fades... \nINT. RANDY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nCorey turns to face the approaching intersection. Resolute. \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON \nChris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department store... \nHe checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke break. \nEXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON \nRandy's car is stopped at the red light. Sam strolls toward it ever so slowly. Jeff, Mike and Ruth gawk at her from the backseat. \nShe slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting herself to any more of their mockery... \nThe light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the intersection, making a left. Sam's still 10 or 15 feet away from stepping into the street... \nShe quickens her pace, almost there when -- \nKA-BOOM! \nFROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the jalopy hits on the front passenger side -- completely smashing it in -- \nSam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH... \nRandy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road. \nThe hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and skitters harmlessly across the intersection -- \nThe world goes SILENT. \nCHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE... \nWATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT USED TO BE... \nTHE JALOPY IS FLIPPED OVER ONTO ITS SIDE... \nSAM STANDS PEERING AT THE WRECKAGE... THE AREA OF THE CAR WHERE COREY WAS SITTING IS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT. SHE DROPS TO HER KNEES. \nINT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON \nSam signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, her eyes red and puffy from crying. O'Dell sits facing her. \nOFFICER O'DELL I just gotta ask you one more time... you're sure you didn't see a driver? \nSam shakes her head no, and he takes the statement from her. \nOFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) Well, we'll find him, one way or another. \nSam nods in acknowledgement. O'Dell sees how much this has traumatized her. \nOFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) Why don't you stop in and see Dr. Peters on your way out... right down the hall there. She'll give you somethin' to make you feel better. \nEXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON \nSam walks out of the police station and finds herself in the secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti- depressants... \nA pair of eyes peek out of the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom. He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle. He sees Sam, but she doesn't see him. \nSam wells up with emotion, about to breakdown, and Tom watches her with empathy. It looks as though he's about to go to her when something stops him -- Chris comes out the door. \nCHRIS You okay? \nSam is still too choked up to speak. Tom sneaks away unnoticed... \nINT. CHRIS' TRUCK - AFTERNOON \nSam sits in the passenger side of Chris' truck and cries and cries. Major emotional release. \nChris looks like he wants to say something, but doesn't have the words. \nI/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING \nChris and Sam pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've gone to get her prescription filled, and Sam has the BOTTLE OF PILLS in her hand. \nJEREMY Sam? Are you okay? What are doing? \nSAM I'm... yeah, I'm okay. \nJeremy gets out of the car and puts his hand on her shoulder. \nJEREMY You shouldn't be out here like this. C'mon, get in. \nShe allows herself to be led to the passenger side... \nINT. JEREMY'S BMW - MORNING \nSam leans her head back against the headrest as Jeremy drives. \nJEREMY You do that a lot? \nSAM I think it's genetic or something. \nJEREMY That's interesting... I've never heard of a specific genetic marker for sleepwalking. \nSAM It's just that my brother used to do it too. \nJEREMY He doesn't anymore? \nSAM No. \nJEREMY I think it's more common in children. When did your brother stop? \nSAM When he died. \nEXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING \nSome WORKERS are in the process of   rebuilding the WINDMILL. A MAN WITH A HOSE sprays the side of   the WATER TANK in an attempt to wash off the burn marks   resembling the nearly imperceptible image of the MONSTER   BUNNY'S FACE... \nI/E. JEREMY'S BMW/MOTEL - MORNING \nJeremy pulls into the motel parking lot. Sam hesitates for a moment before getting out. \nJEREMY I heard about your friend... \nSam doesn't say anything, so he goes on. \nJEREMY (CONT'D) I wasn't gonna say anything... but then I thought I probably should, because if I didn't, it might be inconsiderate. \nSAM Well... okay. Thanks. \nA beat. \nJEREMY So... what are you gonna do? \nSAM I don't know yet. \nSam brushes her mussed hair out of her face, still not wanting to go inside the motel room. \nSAM (CONT'D) Do you believe that everything happens for a reason? \nJEREMY I know that for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. \nSAM Yeah... I learned that in science. \nJEREMY And everything in the universe is in constant motion, as the universe is constantly expanding... \nSAM Yeah, but do you believe that everything happens for a reason, like in life? \nJEREMY You mean like destiny? \nJeremy thinks on this for a moment. \nJEREMY (CONT'D) I think everyone has a purpose. Something they're meant to do. Like potential, but more clear-cut. For instance, I was destined to get my hands on the meteorite. \nSAM Really. \nJEREMY I'm making amazing discoveries every day, practically sleeping at the lab... \nWhile he talks and becomes more excited he scratches nervously at his left forearm. It draws Sam's attention away from what he's saying. \nJEREMY (CONT'D) I'm still doing some tests, but there's a metallic substance that's not showing up on the elemental CHARTS- \nSAM What happened to your arm? \nJeremy stops scratching. A small area on the inner part of his wrist is RAW and RED, partially SCABBED OVER. \nJEREMY It's just a rash. \nSam starts to get out of the car. \nTom shakes his head no. \nSAM (CONT'D) I wish it was me. \nShe looks at Tom. \nSAM (CONT'D) I really want... to die. \nTom aims his gun at her face... \nHe realizes that a FORCE FIELD has formed in between them, because when the barrel of the gun touches it, the barrier bends and becomes slightly opaque. \nSam is expressionless. Tom's finger trembles as he places it on the trigger. \nHe aims down the gun's sights, directly at Sam's RIGHT EYE, and sees a PHOSPHORESCENT GRID take shape like a coordinate system on the force field. Sam's eye is in the CENTRAL QUADRANT... \nTom pulls the trigger. TIME SLOWS DOWN. \nA liquid VECTOR SPEAR shoots out of the gun barrel. Immediately after, a BULLET is discharged and follows it... \nThe VECTOR SPEAR passes cleanly through the grid, but when the BULLET reaches it, the entire force field curves to accommodate the penetrating force... \nThe spear juts out until it nearly touches Sam's eye... but then it stops. The bullet catches up and freezes at the same spot, centimeters from her face -- \nSAM (CONT'D) (DISAPPOINTED) Not today. \nI/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - DAY \nA HAND bangs on the door to room 15... \nAfter a beat, Sam opens it. She's got some makeup on, and has spent more time on her hair than usual. \nSAM (SURPRISED) Hi. \nChris lingers in front of the door, looking slightly uncomfortable. \nCHRIS I just stopped by to see how you were holdin' up. \nSAM I'm okay. \nCHRIS Sorry about the other night... I DIDN'T- \nSAM I was just upset. I shouldn't have snapped at you like that. \nChris nods, grateful for her forgiveness. \nCHRIS So what are you still doin' here? I figured you woulda hopped on a bus by now. \nSAM I'm gonna be taking off soon, I think. I just gotta figure some stuff out. It's quiet here. \nCHRIS I don't know if you're doin' anything later on, but... \nHe trails off when he HEARS a CAR pull up and park by his truck. He turns and sees that it's Jeremy in his BMW. \nSAM I was just on my way out. What were you gonna say? \nCHRIS Nothin'. \nSAM Okay, well... I'll see you later? \nCHRIS Yeah, sure. \nHe steps out of the way so Sam can shut and lock the door. \nSAM Bye. \nCHRIS Bye. \nChris stares down Jeremy as Sam gets into his car and they drive off together. \nINT. LAB - DAY \nJeremy turns on the overhead florescent lights in the lab. There are ROWS OF DESKS with MICROSCOPES and some PRECISION ROCK SLICING EQUIPMENT. \nAs he walks to a desk near the back, he can barely contain his excitement. Sam follows, taking note of a LARGE RABBIT in an extremely SMALL CAGE... \nJEREMY Here's my station. \nHe unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid- like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it. \nSAM That's it? \nJEREMY The rest is locked away somewhere else... somewhere safe. Everyone's gonna want a piece of this thing pretty soon. \nHe takes it over to an SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE and turns it on. He places the meteorite slice in the microscope's VACUUM COLUMN through an AIRTIGHT DOOR. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) If I had kids, I'd be worried sick about `em in a world like this. I'm sure your parents must be. \nSAM Hey, you could've been some crazy rapist serial killer. \nAgatha is there with his coffee just in time to hear this last part. She gives Chris and Sam each an odd look before setting the coffee down and leaving. \nSAM (CONT'D) You turned out okay. \nCHRIS Yeah, but everybody doesn't. \nSAM I can take care of myself. \nCHRIS I'm sure you can... but I wouldn't feel right if I didn't tell you about Jeremy. \nSAM What about him? \nCHRIS I don't know what you have goin' with him... but you shouldn't be hangin' around him. Let's just leave it at that. \nSAM What makes you think you can tell me who I can and can't hang around with? \nCHRIS It's just that I know him better than you do. He lived in my neighborhood when we were kids. \nSAM So? \nCHRIS So he used to do weird stuff... to animals. \nSam waits for him to go on. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) My sister lost her pet rabbit once, and we went all over the neighborhood lookin' for it. We were just about to call it quits when we heard something comin' from Jeremy's garage. He'd stuck it in a trash can and put the lid on. \nSam looks shocked and a little disgusted. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) It was half starved by the time we got it home. Died just a few days later. \nSAM How old was he? \nCHRIS I don't know, just a couple years. Cute little black and white- \nSAM No. Jeremy. \nCHRIS He was like nine, probably. \nSAM He was just a kid, he didn't know what he was doing. \nCHRIS When you were nine years old did you know it was wrong to put a living creature in the trash can and leave it there? \nSam's had enough. \nSAM Chris... you're a nice guy, but you don't have to be looking out for me. You're not my dad, you're not my big brother... \nChris hangs his head, frustrated. \nINT. JAIL CELL - AFTERNOON \nO'Dell stands at the bars of Dusty's jail cell. Dusty lies on his cot and stares up at the ceiling. \nOFFICER O'DELL You know what they do to faggot-ass perverts like you in maximum security, dontcha? \nO'Dell chuckles, enjoying this immensely. \nOFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) Disgusting fuckin' piece a' shit like you... \nEXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - EVENING \nO'Dell, now dressed in plainclothes, is on the way to his CAR in the far corner of the back lot. He HEARS someone come out the door behind him, but doesn't turn until he HEARS his VOICE. \nOFFICER HINES Hey, O'Dell... \nOFFICER O'DELL I'm on my way out... what do you need? \nHines catches up with him and they walk and talk. \nOFFICER HINES I'm not gonna bullshit ya. \nOFFICER O'DELL Okay... \nOFFICER HINES I saw you snatch the drugs outta that house. \nO'Dell's face grows cold but he doesn't slow his pace. \nOFFICER O'DELL I don't think I know what the hell you're talkin' about. \nOFFICER HINES Don't bullshit me either... \nHines grabs his shoulder to stop him. O'Dell eyes his hand. \nWhen Tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with emotion. Sam sees how struck he is, but doesn't understand. \nSAM Do you like to read? \nTom says nothing. \nSAM (CONT'D) You can borrow it... \nAgain, Tom does not speak. After a beat, Sam gets up slowly and walks away, leaving Tom with the book. \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY \nJeremy is at the department store in the FIRST AID SECTION, picking out some GAUZE and DISINFECTANT. When he looks down the aisle and sees Sam, he moves toward her quickly... \nHe disturbs her while she's looking at some FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS. \nJEREMY Sam... \nWhen he sees the items that she's shopping for, he seems much more embarrassed than she does. \nSAM Oh, hi Jeremy. \nJEREMY Hi... sorry. \nSAM That's okay, what's up? \nJEREMY Nothing... just that I haven't see you around for the past few days. I was worried. I thought you might've taken off. \nSAM No... I've been around. Going for lots of walks. \nJEREMY I stopped by the motel. \nSam finds his manner a bit odd. \nSAM Like I said, I've been in and out. \nJEREMY Well, there's something I wanted to ask you. You know that book you mentioned? \nSAM Yeah... \nJEREMY I'd really love to check it out. \nSAM Oh... \nSam's face darkens, and Jeremy picks up on it. \nJEREMY You said you'd show it to me sometime, and I've got a hunch it could really help me in some of my studies related to- \nSAM I don't have it anymore. \nJEREMY What? \nSAM I kind of... gave it to someone. \nJEREMY To who? Why? \nSAM I'm sorry. I just... forgot that I said you could borrow it, and this GUY- \nJEREMY What guy? \nSAM Well... that Vietnam Tom guy. \nJeremy is furious. \nJEREMY Vietnam Tom!? You gave away the book to Vietnam Tom!? \nSam backs away from him. He's getting louder and out of control. \nJEREMY (CONT'D) I don't fucking believe what you're telling me! \nSAM It's just a book... \nJEREMY He's a fucking bum! And you chose him over me!? \nSAM No... I just- \nSuddenly, a hand comes down on Jeremy's shoulder. He turns and finds Chris standing behind him. \nCHRIS That's enough. \nSam is relieved. Jeremy glares at Chris. \nJEREMY This is none of your business. \nCHRIS It is, actually. You're disturbing my customers. Get out. \nOfficer Hines walks to the edge of the woods beside the warehouse and unzips his pants... \nANGLE: O'DELL'S CAR \nWith GLOVED HANDS, O'Dell grabs VIETNAM TOM'S RIFLE out of the trunk... \nINT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nTrudy's head is buried in her hands and she bawls. \nTRUDY I feel like such an idiot... \nFather Homeijer doesn't know what to say. \nEXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nHines finishes relieving himself and comes out into the open from the side of the building. O'Dell is waiting for him. \nOFFICER HINES What the fuck- \nBOOM! \nO'Dell shoots him in the chest. He is cool and calm. He throws the rifle down on the ground... \nEXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT \nThe SHOPPING CARTS whirl in an circle of ever-increasing speed around Vietnam Tom and Sam. The RUBBER WHEELS squeal on the cement until they start to melt... \nThe VECTOR SPEARS lead the carts in a spiral that hones in closer and closer to the two of them. Sam is stoic. Tom is in awe... \nEXT. THE ETHER - NIGHT - POV INSIDE PORTAL \nWe travel at breath-taking speed through a PORTAL as it weaves through millions of STARS, then an ATMOSPHERIC BARRIER... \nEXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT \nWhen it looks like they'll be crushed by the scudding metal, or combusted by the cosmic energy, the WORM-LIKE PORTAL from the sky reaches down and encloses Tom and Sam like a vacuum. \nThere's a brilliant FLASH OF LIGHT -- TRANSITION TO: \nEXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THE NEXT MORNING \nCHRIS' TRUCK pulls into the lot early in the morning, and he gets out wearing his work uniform. Still groggy, he's about to walk into the store when something catches his eye... \nCRANE UP to FIND a STRUCTURE made of all the SHOPPING CARTS, as chilling and impressive as a crop circle, in the shape of an immense FIBONACCI SPIRAL. The metal of the carts has been fused together, and they're stacked in an ascending manner that reaches an apex in the center, like a cone. \nChris is mystified... CUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nTwo POLICE CRUISERS speed down a street in town... \nEXT. PARK - AFTERNOON \nCOPS, including Officer O'Dell, converge on Vietnam Tom in the park, where he sits on the SWING in his ski mask... \nCOP #1 Get down on the ground! \nTom looks up at them calmly, without fear. \nCOP #1 (CONT'D) Get down on the ground, now! \nHe obeys them and two Cops jump on him and put him in cuffs. One of them pulls up his head and rips off his ski mask -- \nTom's face is a mass of SCARS. Both his cheeks, forehead and chin are marred by scar tissue born from long, deep gashes. \nO'Dell looks into his sad, blue eyes... \nINT. POLICE STATION, VARIOUS - AFTERNOON \nTom is slammed against a table. An OFFICER takes his hand roughly and sticks his fingers into some ink to take his prints -- JUMP CUT TO: \nPOLICEMAN (V.O.) Name? \nTom stands for his booking photos -- JUMP CUT TO: \nPOLICEMAN (CONT'D) (getting angry) What's your name? \nThe POLICEMAN stands over Vietnam Tom, who sits defeated in a chair. A YOUNG OFFICER approaches. \nYOUNG OFFICER We found this on him... \nHe passes the Policeman a set of DOG TAGS on a CHAIN. The name on the tags is: THOMAS WARD SPARROW. \nEXT. MOTEL - EVENING \nJeremy stomps on the gas pedal, and Chris is forced to unhand him as his BMW navigates around the truck and barrels down the hill... \nEXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - LATER - NIGHT \nAs Chris approaches Vietnam Tom's squatting ground, the FIREWORKS DISPLAY is in the midst of the GRANDE FINALE. Showers of light BURST and CRACKLE in steady succession. PEOPLE SCREAM in approval from the parking area nearby... \nChris comes upon Sam's lifeless form. \nCHRIS No... \nHe stoops by her, picks her up and hugs her limp body close... \nAs he does this, Vietnam Tom approaches from behind him. Chris turns to face him but says nothing, still holding Sam. The WIND picks up and blows in gusts around them... \nTom looks down at the two of them for a moment, then reaches down and picks up his BUNNY MASK. The EVIL GRIN is red with SAM'S BLOOD, and one of the teeth is missing... \nThe last of the fireworks display occurs, leaving the night full of SMOKE, HELLISH CLOUDS and an increasing number of bright-tailed METEORS -- the APOCALYPSE. \nAmongst the churning clouds, a tornado-like PORTAL cuts through the sky and touches down somewhere in the town. It's swirling and vast, stretching down from limitless space... \nSAM (V.O.) 15 days... 18 hours... \nTom puts on the BUNNY MASK... \nSAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)                 VIETNAM TOM 45 minutes... 6 seconds...      45 minutes... 6 seconds... \nAnd focuses on a single METEOR that plummets toward the yawning VORTEX, using telekinetic power to guide it... \nEXT. THE ETHER - NIGHT - POV INSIDE PORTAL \nThe METEOR blazes through the WORMHOLE -- \nKEY SCENES IN REVERSE \nTHE BARS TO THE JAIL CELL STRAIGHTEN -- \nTHE WORDS `THOMAS WARD SPARROW' ARE LIFTED FROM THE BOOKING SLIP -- \nSHOPPING CARTS SWIRL IN A DECONSTRUCTING SPIRAL -- \nO'DELL GIVES TOM BACK HIS RIFLE -- \nFATHER HOMEIJER PLACES BILLY MOORCROFT BACK IN HIS CAGE -- \nSAM PICKS UP THE PAYPHONE -- \nTHE CHURCH REBUILDS ITSELF OUT OF FLAMES -- \nTHE THREE CROSSES IN IMITATION OF CALVARY RIGHT THEMSELVES -- \nSAM'S FACE DIPS BENEATH THE SURFACE OF RANDY'S POOL -- TRANSITION TO: \nEXT. BANK - NIGHT \nThe clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to -- JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29 MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS... \nINT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT \nSam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed. \nTWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed. The CLOCK/RADIO reads 3:30 AM. \nEXT. WINDMILL PLATFORM - NIGHT \nVietnam Tom sits atop the platform, more than 30 feet up, wearing his ski mask and holding his rifle. The surface of the platform is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE, CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. \nRelaxed and at peace, Tom looks up to the clear night sky. As a TREMOR starts to build, he takes off his ski mask and gazes out over his town... \nHe smiles. \nSuddenly, there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION -- CUT TO: \nCHARACTER MONTAGE \nDusty sits and stares at his CELLAR DOOR... Trudy holds a PICTURE OF FATHER HOMEIJER and cries... Ruth snorts some COKE in her room... Jeremy scratches his LEFT FOREARM in his sleep... Billy Moorcroft shivers from the chill in his CAGE... Officer O'Dell sits alone in his patrol car, fingering the trigger of his PISTOL... TRANSITION TO: \nEXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING \nWhere the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits of wood and metal strewn everywhere. Ground water spurts from the broken well seal. \nA cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the crater... \nTwo FIREMEN haul out the meteorite as Sam and O'Dell arrive on the scene. There are PARAMEDICS, a CORONER and other POLICEMEN there as well, and a large area has been cordoned off with POLICE TAPE. \nCorey is there looking on, as well as Chris Holt, Phil Coulter, and other local CITIZENS. TOM'S REMAINS are carried off in a BLACK BAG... \n", "test1_input": "Inside Billy Moorcroft's quaint, sanitary-looking home is a small gathering to celebrate his return. STREAMERS hang over a table supporting a partially eaten CAKE. A BANNER that reads `WELCOME HOME BILLY!' is draped across the archway connecting the DINING ROOM to the DEN. \nBILLY'S MOTHER (32), with her fair complexion and dark hair, is an older female version of Billy himself. \nAs she brings a POT OF COFFEE and a STACK OF CUPS into BILLY'S FATHER (35), BILLY'S AUNT and UNCLE, and a CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST who is moderating (50s; male) in the den, she looks as though she's barely keeping it together. \nCHILD PSYCHOLOGIST (between bites of cake) The place for Billy to be right now is at home with his family... \nBilly's Mother interrupts as she sets the coffee down. \nBILLY'S MOTHER Excuse me. \nCHILD PSYCHOLOGIST Oh, thank you. \nThe Psychologist accepts a cup. \nCHILD PSYCHOLOGIST (CONT'D) It'll take years for him to work through what happened, but the best way to open those doors is to surround him with things that are familiar... \nBilly's Mother passes her husband a cup, and they hold a long, painful moment of eye contact. \nINT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nBilly sits at a table in the sunny, HEXAGONAL ROOM. He wears the BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. \nHe appears clean and groomed, but his face and neck are marred by BRUISES and other ABRASIONS. Before him is a packet of COLORED PENCILS and some sheets of PAPER. \nHis Mother walks up behind him, and peeks over his shoulder at the DRAWING that he's working on. \nBILLY'S MOTHER Are you sure you don't want some more cake? \nBilly nods. His mother caresses his head as she watches him color. After a moment she sits down in a chair beside him and tries to get his attention. \nBILLY'S MOTHER (CONT'D) Billy... I- \nBefore she can go on, she's interrupted by the DOORBELL. Billy never looks up. \nI/E. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY \nBilly's Father answers the door and finds Corey. \nBILLY'S FATHER Only family and close friends are welcome here today. \nBilly's Mother hovers behind her husband, curious about and wary of the stranger. \nCOREY I understand... I just wanted to say that I'm sorry about everything that happened to Billy. And I know it doesn't seem like it, but everything happens for a reason... and it'll all work out in the end. \nBilly's Father stares her down until she turns to leave uncomfortably. Billy's Mother starts to cry... CUT BACK TO: \nINT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY \n...the breakfast nook. Billy is gone. \nLeft on the table is his completed DRAWING. It's a neatly executed rendition of a SWING SET -- identical to the one from Corey's vision in the closet door mirror. \nEXT. PARK - DAY \nBilly walks through the empty park, still wearing his birthday hat. He makes his way past a SAND PIT with a JUNGLE GYM. \nBalanced on one of the jungle gym's bars is a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE... \nBilly picks it up. The name on the prescription is COREY RICHARDSON. JUMP CUT TO: \nThe SWING SET. Billy leans back as far as he can as momentum propels his body forward and back through space. He looks up to the sky where SUPERNATURAL BLACK CLOUDS are forming... \nHe swings back and forth... back and forth... \nANGLE: PARK BENCH \nCorey sits nearby on a park bench, watching Billy. He looks back at her, showing no signs of recognition... JUMP CUT TO: \nThe SWING. No longer a little boy sitting in it.

RANDY'S CAR/STREET IN FRONT OF DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON \nSam is walking in front of the department store when Randy's car pulls up beside her.

Want a burger? \nSAM My stomach's fucked up. \nJEFF                               MIKE Awww...                           Poor tummy... \nJeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers. \nSAM (CONT'D) We gotta talk about what we're gonna do. \nCOREY Don't worry about it so much. \nSAM The motel guy came to the room this MORNING- \nCOREY (INTERRUPTING) I don't give a fuck. \nSAM Excuse me? \nCOREY I said, I. Don't. Give. A. Fuck... \nShe annunciates every word like a true bitch. \nCOREY (CONT'D) I'm tired of listening to you whine about everything. \nGiggles from the peanut gallery in the car. \nSAM Corey, you're still drunk.

DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS \nChris lights up a cigarette... \nCHRIS' POV - TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK \nHe watches as the TRACTOR-TRAILER hits the pothole, but passes safely through the intersection, making a right. \nSomething about the sight of this strikes Chris so much that his cigarette falls out of his mouth. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nFather Homeijer and Trudy stroll down a quiet street with their COLLECTIONS JAR, and arrive at a fork in the road. \nFATHER HOMEIJER You take this street, I'll take that one? \nWithout warning, Trudy kisses him on the cheek. \nTRUDY Good luck. \nFather Homeijer blushes, but Trudy smiles at him in a friendly manner. They move off in separate directions... \nEXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - DAY \nFather Homeijer raps on the door of Dusty's house. No answer. \nINT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY \nThe priest lets himself into the garage, which is open but deserted. He notices COREY'S CHEVROLET. He steps up to the GARAGE ENTRANCE and knocks... \nNo one comes to the door, but he notices that it's slightly ajar. \nFATHER HOMEIJER Dusty? \nHe can hear COUNTRY MUSIC playing low within. \nFATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D) Are you home, son? \nHe lets himself inside... \nINT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY \nFather Homeijer walks into the dingy kitchen. The SINK is full of DIRTY DISHES. A coating of GRIME over everything. \nINT.

DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nThe priest sees that the COUNTRY SONG is coming from a STEREO that sits on the kitchen counter. \nFATHER HOMEIJER (calling out) Dusty? I'd like to trouble you for a small donation... \nThe COUNTRY SONG comes to a close, and the tape runs out. With the music gone, the priest cocks his head to a new sound -- soft, distant CRYING. \nHe looks curiously toward the CELLAR DOOR... [Note: The CRYING SOUND should be identical to the one that drew Corey out of the motel room.] \nINT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, BASEMENT - DAY \nFather Homeijer slowly descends the rickety BASEMENT STEPS. At the bottom, he finds a STRING that connects to a bare overhead BULB... \nHe creeps along the dusty cement floor, past an old WASHER/DRYER, continuing toward the source of the CRYING, which has become more pronounced. He wrinkles his nose at a foul smell... \nFATHER HOMEIJER Who's there? \nHe rounds a corner, and when he sees Billy Moorcroft he's nearly frozen in shock -- \nThe boy is locked inside a large, METAL DOG'S CAGE. He sits on the floor of the cage, rocking back and forth. \nHe is pale, bruised and slick with sweat, clothed only in a pair of SOILED BRIEFS. Beside him is an aluminum WATER BOWL and some scraps of WHITE BREAD. The floor beneath him is soaked with URINE and scattered FECES. \nFather Homeijer makes the sign of the cross. \nEXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAY \n", "test2_true": "Father Homeijer stands near the boy, being interviewed by a DETECTIVE. \nDusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another policeman, OFFICER HINES (28). \nOFFICER O'DELL Get in there, you sick fuck... \nDusty says nothing as O'Dell shoves him in and slams the door... \nThe two officers turn when they see RANDY'S DAD'S CAR pull up next to the property. Randy is in the driver's seat, looking confused. Ruth hops out of the passenger seat and darts toward the house -- \n-- but she is cut off and grabbed by a POLICEMAN. ANOTHER OFFICER goes to talk to Randy in the car. \nWheels turning, O'Dell addresses Hines: \nOFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) (regarding Dusty) Let him rot in there for a few minutes, maybe till the news guys show up... I'm gonna go finish checkin' upstairs. \nINT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, RUTH'S BEDROOM - DAY \nO'Dell lets himself into Ruth's bedroom. It's a mess -- her CLOTHES are all over the floor, and crinkled ROCK POSTERS litter the walls. \nNext to her bed is a FRAMED PICTURE of she and Randy. O'Dell starts to rifle through her desk drawers, one after another -- \nHe tosses the closet, throwing out clothes and shoes... until he finds the SHOEBOX. He opens it up, satisfied... \nANGLE: OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM DOOR \nOfficer Hines stands by the door, looking in at O'Dell covertly. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MORNING \nSam lies in bed in front of the television.

Billy's condition at this time is considered stable... \nSam stares at the television, dumbfounded. The news cuts to the scene of the rescue, where Father Homeijer is being INTERVIEWED: \nFIELD REPORTER Father, what led you to this particular house on this particular day? \nFATHER HOMEIJER I was out collecting donations in order to help rebuild my church, Mount Calvary, which recently burned down. Clearly the Lord works in mysterious ways. This is nothing less than divine intervention... \nEXT.

No matter how well you think you know somebody, you just never really know... \nINT. DINER - MORNING \nSam sits at the booth where she and Corey sat before, and Agatha sets down a glass of ORANGE JUICE. \nAGATHA Dusty Gibbens has been comin' in here for coffee ever since I can remember... gives me the shivers. \nTed pipes up from behind the counter: \nTED They should hang guys like that. Only thing bothers me is how many of `em are still out there... \nChris enters the diner and catches the end of Ted's rant. \nTED (CONT'D) Hang `em all. \nAGATHA (to Sam) I'll be right back with your breakfast. \nAs Agatha moves off, Chris sees Sam and approaches her table. \nCHRIS May I? \nSAM Sure. \nCHRIS I guess you heard. \nSAM Yeah. \nCHRIS It's so messed up... I feel bad that I recommended him now. \nAgatha notices that Chris has sat down with Sam. \nAGATHA What can I get you, honey? \nCHRIS Uh... sausage, eggs, coffee, please. \nAGATHA White or wheat? \nCHRIS Wheat toast, please... \nHe refocuses his attention back on Sam. \n", "test2_id": 2371, "test3_input": "A SPARKLING GREEN BALL shoots out of the stick into the air.

Jeremy shoots off colorful ball after ball, aiming in different directions. \nSAM They're pretty. \nAfter his stick fizzles out: \nJEREMY You wanna try one? \nSam shrugs... He grabs another out of the grocery bag, and Sam gets up slowly.

The WICK catches... \nJEREMY (CONT'D) It's goin'! \nSam smiles and holds the stick as far away from her face as possible. She closes her eyes... \nBut the wick burns down extremely fast.

WOODED GROVE NEARBY - NIGHT \nJeremy finishes wrapping the piece of his T-shirt around Sam's hand, creating the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE. \nJEREMY How's it feel? \nSAM A little better... \nThe FIREWORKS suddenly begin, and fill the sky above the grove with bursts of bright, multi-colored lights. Sporadic METEORS rain down at the same time. It's magnificent. \nAfter a beat, Sam looks over at Jeremy... \nThe fireworks illuminate his torso, and she is appalled to see that the raw, reddish RASH has spread to cover the greater part of it. \nSAM (CONT'D) Good God... \nJeremy looks down as if he'd forgotten, then quickly picks up his jacket and puts it back on. \nSAM (CONT'D) (ALARMED) Is that from the meteorite? \nJEREMY I barely even notice it anymore. I'm sure it'll go away soon. \nHe zips up his jacket tight. \nSAM Are you fucking kidding me? \nJEREMY Do you think I'm disgusting? \nThe question takes Sam by surprise. \nSAM No... I just think you should get it looked at- \nBefore Sam can finish, Jeremy crams his mouth into hers for a forceful kiss... \nSam shoves him away sharply. \nSAM (CONT'D) What the hell are you doing? \n", "test3_true": "SAM Jesus Christ... \nHe tries to grab her, but Sam turns and runs -- \nJEREMY Come here! \nEXT.

The EXPLOSIONS and the RUCKUS from CROWD mask their noise. \nJEREMY (CONT'D) Stop it! \nSam raises her knee and connects hard with his groin. He starts to double over, but recovers quickly and smacks her across the face -- \nJEREMY (CONT'D) Fucking bitch! \nSam is stunned, and Jeremy takes her by the shoulders and shoves her hard -- \nSam stumbles backwards and falls, cracking her head on the metal BUNNY MASK.

JAIL CELL - NIGHT \nVietnam Tom walks up to the CELL BARS... \nHe comes face to face with Sam. \nShe stares back at him through the bars from the other side. She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and the BANDAGE. Light glints off the METAL lodged in her HEAD WOUND. \nI/E. JEREMY'S BMW/LOOKOUT - NIGHT \nJeremy speeds frantically down the hill, away from the parking area and the continuing fireworks display. Tears stream down his cheeks... \nHe cuts the wheel when a pair of HEADLIGHTS blind him and a vehicle cuts him off. His car skids out, and he sees it's CHRIS' TRUCK that has almost hit him. \nChris jumps out, yanks open Jeremy's door and grabs him by the shirt collar. He yells over the FIREWORKS: \nCHRIS Where the hell is Sam? \nJEREMY (FRANTIC) I don't know... I don't know... \n", "test3_id": 2372}

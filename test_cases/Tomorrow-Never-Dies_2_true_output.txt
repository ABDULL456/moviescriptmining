Harmsway looks up at him. Blinks in disbelief. 
BOND I never believe what I read in the newspapers. 
Harmsway slowly brings up the gun. 
HARMSWAY Pity you'll miss your obituary. 
Bond smacks the gun out of his hand with contempt. Moves closer. 
BOND Where is she, Harmsway? 
BOOM! The fuel tanks explode in the distance. The bridge rocks violently; the room tilts to a greater angle. 
HARMSWAY You want to kill me, Bond? Go ahead. 
With both arms, Bond pushes Harmsway backwards, flinging him downward against the starboard wall. The water is rising on the bridge. 
BOND (moving in on him) Where is she Harmsway? - 
He grabs Harmsway by the lapels, and throws him against the front wall, crashing onto the instrument panel head first. 
Harmsway laughs maniacally, face down on the gauges: 
HARMSWAY What is it, Bond? You haven't the guts? 
Boom! There's another explosion in the background! The front of the boat tilts upward! The water is rushing in! 
Bond grabs Harmsway by the shoulder - 
BOND You spineless paper tiger - 
And yanks him off the instrument panel, flinging him backwards against the rear wall of the bridge. 
BOND Where is she, Harmsway?!? Or did you kill her like Paris? 
Suddenly, THE BOAT GROANS. The BRIDGE RISES OUT OF THE WATER! AND BOND loses his balance, FALLING ONTO HARMSWAY - 
HARMSWAY (glaring, insanely:) We all go down together!!! 
Harmsway lunges for Bond's throat - 
AND THE BRIDGE SLIPS UNDERWATER - 
Where Bond breaks Harmsway's grasp in a violent struggle - then punches him. Air bubbles break from Harmsway's mouth. He frantically tries to break free for the surface - 
But Bond pulls him back down, and holds him down, pushing down on Harmsway's shoulders. 
Harmsway is thrashing about, flailing in all directions, pounding at Bond in a haze of bubbles... 
Then falls still. 
With his lungs aching, bursting with fire, Bond rockets up - 
UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) - 
through the bridge windows, up to - 
THE SURFACE. 
He breaks through the water, gasping for air... And then, almost instantly, dives down again. 
UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) - 
Bond dives for the boat - down, and down, chasing it, as if he could just grab it, and stop it from sinking. 
He goes deeper, and deeper, as it sinks further and further away, just beyond his reach. 
And just when it seems impossible for him to survive - to hold his breath a second longer - 
A FIGURE IN SCUBA GEAR (mask and tank) GRABS HIM. 
Bond turns in disbelief. Stares into the mask: IT'S SIDNEY. She puts her regulator in Bond's mouth... 
And they share the air as they rise from the depths. 
THE SURFACE - 
They break through the water. Sidney yanks off her mask. Teases: 
SIDNEY What do you mean, you'd rather die alone? 
BOND I didn't say when I want to die - 
She splashes him. Turning away, Bond spots Stamper's 'arms cache' dinghy floating nearby. 
NEW ANGLE - THE DINGHY - 
Bond climbs into it, then helps Sidney get in. They collapse in the bottom of the boat, resting their heads against the gunwale. 
After a beat, SIDNEY CLEARS HER THROAT. Bond is already amused: 
BOND ... Yes??? 
SIDNEY Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight. 
BOND ... Yes? 
SIDNEY First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine. 
BOND And number two? 
SIDNEY If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear: (pause) We're going to have it where I want, and when I want. 
BOND And when might that be? 
SIDNEY Now. 
He laughs. She falls into his arms. They kiss, and we cut to: 
TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS - 
With the dinghy reflected in the glass. In unison, they are both lowered, revealing Q and Wade. 
Q ... As usual, I see the situation is in 007's very capable hands. 
WADE Life is not fair. 
Q (emphatically) You're right. 
A British naval officer appears. 
OFFICER Excuse me, Major Boothroyd - the message went to London. 
Q Thank you. 
Q and Wade throw a glance back to the sea, then turn, waking off: 
WADE Tell me, Q-ster. You do ever do any gardening?

INT. KAREL PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY - DAY 
OVER BLACK 
PAT What, are you kidding me? Sundays? I love Sundays. I live for Sundays. The whole family's together. Mom makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on. We're all watching the game. Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes, I was negative. 
FADE IN ON: 
INT. KAREL PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY/PAT'S ROOM - DAY 
PAT SOLATANO stands in the middle of his room, his back to camera. 
PAT (CONT'D) You didn't even know that I loved it, Nikki, but I did. I just didn't appreciate it, or you, before." There is a knock at the door. 
MALE ORDERLY (O.S.) Come on. Time to go. 
PAT I lost all that. I blew it. But you also blew it. We can get it back. We're gonna get it back. It's all gonna be better now. I'm better now and I hope you are, too. And I'm 
GONNA APPRECIATE--" Another knock at the door. Pat ignores it. 
PAT (CONT'D) Hey, I'll be there in a minute, okay? 
MALE ORDERLY (O.S.) Doctor's waiting. Let's go. 
PAT I'll be there in a minute. Pat returns to his speech. 
PAT (CONT'D) That's true love. See glimpses of Pat's room: mayonnaise jar filled with water, black trash bag strewn on the bed, handwritten sign taped to Pat's wall, "EXCELSIOR". 
INT. PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY/ HALLWAY - DAY 
PAT HURRIES DOWN THE STAIRS. 
INT. PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY/ DISPENSARY - DAY 
PAT HOLDS SMALL PAPER CONTAINER WITH PILL. 
TIPS HIS HEAD BACK AND DUMPS THE PILL INTO HIS MOUTH. DRINKS WATER, OPENS MOUTH WIDE AND STICKS HIS TONGUE OUT to show he swallowed. 
PAT WALKS, SPITTING OUT THE PILL. PILL LANDS ON FLOOR. 
INT. PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY/ROOM - DAY 
A GROUP OF PATIENTS SEATED IN A CIRCLE WITH A DOCTOR, HAVING 
A GROUP THERAPY SESSION. PAT IS INCLUDED. 
DANNY Yeah, that's when I had long hair. People say I talk about my hair too much. 
DANNY SITS BETWEEN TWO OTHER MALE PATIENTS. 
DANNY (CONT'D) And it was just the way I wanted it, but he cut it back too far. He cut this side back too far trying to even it up. I didn't tell him to do that. I said, "Just cut it the way you cut it...." 
PAT Once you get in the right frame of mind, I think anything's possible. I think we get, we so often get caught in this state of negativity and it's a, it's a poison like nothing else. 
EXT. PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY - DAY 
PAT works out: drinks water from his plastic mayo jar, does squats, sit ups, push ups -- 
A WOMAN'S FOOT STEPS INTO FRAME NOT FAR FROM HIS FACE -- WITH 
RED TOE NAILS IN A WHITE FLAT SANDAL -- Pat looks at the foot -- then looks up -- HIS MOTHER, DOLORES SOLATANO, dressed in a dress. 
INT. PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY/HALLWAY - DAY 
CAMERA TILTS UP OVER A MALE DOCTOR, DR. TIMBERS, AS HE WALKS 
WITH DOLORES. PAT FOLLOWS. CAMERA MOVES BACK WITH THEM. 
DR. TIMBERS ...technically, you can take him out against our recommendation, but you assume a lot of liability in the eyes of the court. And he's just getting used to the routine here. 
DOLORES I don't want him to get used to the routine here. Eight months is already long enough. 
INT. PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY/OFFICE - DAY

PASSENGER SEAT. DOLORES IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. 
THE CAR BEGINS TO MOVE, DANNY APPEARS., CARRYING A SUITCASE. 
PAT Hey, Mom. Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly? 
DOLORES STOPS THE CAR. 
DOLORES What? I don't understand. 
PAT Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine. 
DANNY OPENS THE REAR PASSENGER SEAT AND GETS INTO THE CAR 
WITH HIS SUITCASE. 
DANNY I guess everybody's leaving today! Hello, Mrs. S. An honor to finally meet you. Pat told me all about you, how God made you rich in character, and you're the mighty oak that holds the household together, and not to mention the lasagna you make on game day when the Birds play. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
DOLORES'S CAR DRIVES TOWARDS PHILADELPHIA. 
INT. DOLORES'S CAR - DAY 
PAT Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol. 
DANNY Bad combination. 
PAT Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder. 
DANNY That was when I was an X-ray technician with my ADD and my anxiety. I had a lot of access to medication and I took advantage of it. That's when my hair was long, too. But my hair only grew when I was older. When I was younger, my hair didn't grow because my brother...

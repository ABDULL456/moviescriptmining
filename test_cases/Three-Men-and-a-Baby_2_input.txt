JERRY What if you just put her back to bed? NATALIE Right -- she's just throwing a temper tantrum, put her to bed... PETER We already tried... 
JACK It's her teeth... NATALIE (to Jerry) Do you have any kids? JERRY'S WIFE Yeah, but they're grown up now, thank God! CHRISTIE (to Jay) And do you have kids, too? JAY What? CHRISTIE I said... and do you have kids, too? JAY No, we both have careers. The guests remain silent, MARY CONTINUES to CRY. CARL So, do you think we'll get to taste that three-tiered cake tonight? PETER What? CARL (to Natalie, sarcastically) Oh, nothing, nothing -- I was just trying to liven up the 
conversation... PETER What? CHRISTIE Gosh, my ears are ringing, I can't hear anybody. CAROLINE I must say, a crying kid is kind of hard to take... PETER What? 
CARL (loudly) We were just saying that this baby's conversation is actually rather limited... and a touch annoying. Don't you think? PETER Well, she's not the only one with a limited conversation. At least she has an excuse, she's a baby! What's yours? CARL I frankly don't know what you mean. PETER I mean, I've been listening to your pompous drivel about the latest trends for the last two hours, and frankly, it's a crock of horseshit. JERRY Come on, Peter, be nice... JAY Listen, go put the baby to bed and you guys cool it, will you? CARL It's okay. I'm used to it. Peter's always been a sore loser. PETER (totally out of control) You motherfucker, get out of here! Get out of my house right now or I'll kick the shit out 
of you! You snobbish scum- sucking snake! JERRY Peter, cut it out! 
JACK Stop it, Peter. Give her to me, I'll put her to bed... PETER (beside himself) No, I'll go. (to all the guests) And you can all go fuck yourselves! Go back to your asinine conversations! He exits with Mary.    Jack, embarrassed, follows him. MICHAEL (trying to recover) Well... umm... How 'bout if I get the cake now, okay? He exits. CARL Well. It seems our beloved hosts are going to be busy playing mother for a while, so if you'll excuse me, I'll just slip away... (to Natalie) ... Natalie, may I invite you to spend the rest of the evening in a more hospitable place? NATALIE Gladly. (to the guests) Goodbye. They exit. JAY (to Jerry and his wife) Is he out of his mind or what? JERRY He was absolutely obnoxious. CHRISTIE (drunk, getting up and tottering) Hey, Caroline, I think we should 
go, too. I don't feel so good... I think I'm gonna barf... CAROLINE (running to help her) Oh, God, no! Hold it back! CHRISTIE (starting to cry) I wanna go home... CAROLINE Okay, we're going... (to the others) Sorry... say goodbye to Jack for us... They exit.   Christie is hanging on to Caroline. JAY (to Jerry) Look, there's no point in our staying any longer. I think it's best we leave. JAY'S WIFE (to Jerry) Tell Peter if was a wonderful party. JERRY (sad) Okay... 'Bye... SOPHIA Can you drop me off near Soho by any chance? JAY Sure. SOPHIA Thanks! (to Jerry and his Wife) 'Bye... Say goodbye to them for me... Sophia, Jay and his Wife exit. JERRY'S WIFE Well, we might as well go, too. I think the evening's over. She gets up, so does Jerry. 
Michael, very playful, comes back in carrying an enormous three-tiered cake. MICHAEL Ta-da! Will you look at this? Is this a cake or what? Can someone make a little room on the table so I can... Are you guys leaving? JERRY Yeah, we're beat. MICHAEL Hey, where is everybody? 
JERRY'S WIFE Well, the atmosphere wasn't exactly festive... JERRY Sorry about the cake, Mike... It looks great! MICHAEL Oh, never mind, don't worry... Good night... Jerry and his Wife exit. Michael is left standing there with his cake. Jack comes in, full of beans. JACK Well, she's asleep at last! We sang in har... Hey, where is everybody? MICHAEL Gone. Can you make a little room for me on the table to put the... JACK You mean they're all gone? MICHAEL Yeah, all of 'em, hey, can you make a little room for me to... JACK (going back out, furious) Peter! Peter, goddamit, get out here! Peter comes back in with Jack. JACK They're all gone!

Bob sits on the bed talking to Debora on the phone. 
BOB Yeah, no it's been...well, I won't lie to you Debora - it's been pretty damn hairy. 
DEBORA (O.S.) (over phone, not as concerned as Bob would like) Yeah. We've been watching it on Fox. 
(CONTINUED) 
12   CONTINUED:                                                12 
BOB Yeah, it's not, uh... I've seen things that you shouldn't, you know... He shakes his head sadly. 
BOB (CONT'D) Pretty damn hairy. 
DEBORA (O.S.) Well I don't even know why you're there. You're not exactly war correspondent material are you? 
BOB 
(STUNG) Well, I think it's important people get an accurate picture of what's... 
DEBORA (O.S.) (to someone else) What? Yeah. 
BOB 
(LISTENING) ...what's, uh, happening, so...is that Dave? 
DEBORA (O.S.) Yeah. He says Hi. Bob stares out of the window, nodding, afraid he might start to cry. 
BOB Oh, that's, that's... He BEATS his head off the wall for a moment. 
BOB (CONT'D) Okay. Gotta go. We're moving out - heading up north to cover the fighting there... 
13   EXT. KUWAIT CITY -    HOTEL - DAY                         13 
Bob walks out and puts his sunglasses on, staring around the quiet POOL-SIDE area. He sighs, sits down on a a sunlounger, starts to read his book. TITLES READ "Kuwait City, Kuwait, Spring 2003." 
JOURNALIST (O.S.) You missed the war? 
14   INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - DAY                                  14 
Bob is drinking coffee with two gung-ho type war correspondents. 
BOB Yeah. They laugh. 
SECOND JOURNALIST How? 
BOB 
(EMBARRASSED) I've been stuck here. They've only just given me the green-light. So I'll probably head over there soon. I'm just working on this story about American contractors coming over for the re-build. The Journalists look bored. 
BOB (CONT'D) Yeah, I think they didn't want me going over because I'm not embedded. 
SECOND JOURNALIST Yeah, they don't like the unilats. The troops think the unilats'll stab `em in the back. When you're 
EMBEDDED you form a bond with the soldiers. You're like one of them. 
FIRST JOURNALIST (to Second 
JOURNALIST) You see action? 
SECOND JOURNALIST Went into Baghdad with Charlie Company, Second Brigade, Third Infantry Division... 
FIRST JOURNALIST The thunder run? Heard you had it pretty bad. 
SECOND JOURNALIST Could say that. Technicals all the way, RPG's, fuckers were firing anti-aircraft guns at us... 
(CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED:                                                 14 
FIRST JOURNALIST You know a Private First Class Zuchero? 
SECOND MAN Zook? I was standing next to him when he took a hit... Bob sits ignored, feeling inadequate as they continue to swap war stories. 
15   EXT. HOTEL TERRACE - NIGHT                                 15

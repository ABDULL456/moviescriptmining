131   INT. THIRD FLOOR HOTEL - NIGHT                              131 
Cobb and Stump hurry along looking for Hornsby's room. LOUD MUSIC and LAUGHTER spills out of the room at the end of the hall. We see a woman enter the room. COBB There it is! 
STUMP You sure you're up for this? COBB I've never been readier! Cobb takes a hit on his flask and they knock at the door. Hornsby answers the door -- we can see a party behind him, full of old players, booze, cigars -- and even some women, though the whole thing is infinitely tamer than the smokers Cobb remembers. 
COBB Rajah! HORNSBY You ain't comin' in, Ty. COBB It's me!   An' Stumpy here! 
Cobb starts pushing on the door.     Hornsby holds firm. HORNSBY You're a bastard and you ain't coming to our party. 
COBB Who's in there?! 
(CONTINUED) 
131   CONTINUED:                                                     131 HORNSBY Me and Mickey an' a coupla broads. 
COBB Let me talk to Mickey. 
Hornsby signals to Cochrane who comes over to the door. 
COCHRANE Ty... 
COBB Ya look good in that tux, Mick. COCHRANE I can't let ya in, Ty. It's Rogers' party. I'm an invited guest. COBB God damn it, let me in! Cobb tries to break into the party but Hornsby rushes over and shoves the door in his face, leaving Ty and Stump alone. COBB Presidents of the United States of America used to invite me to the White House to drink their Scotch and smoke their cigars and fuck their women. STUMP Let's go to the motel, Ty... Cobb heads down the hallway pounding on every door -- he's ready to explode. 
COBB Let me in, God damn it! I invented this game! Let me in! 
STUMP Let's go home, Ty, this isn't a good place to be... 
COBB (screaming) I fought for players' rights and salary increases and unions while all you crawled around on your knees begging massa' for bread crumbs just thankful for a job! (MORE)

131   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            131 COBB (CONT'D) Open up,   God damn it! Ballplayers can make   big money but they're too stupid!    You're all too stupid! The hell   with ya! 
Cobb grabs Stump and pulls his face close. 
COBB Take me back to the Hall!

132   EXT. HALL OF FAME BUILDING - LATE AT NIGHT                   132 
Charles, the Hall director, opens the door for Cobb and Stump. He clearly has been summoned in the middle of the night. STUMP I appreciate your coming. CHARLES For Mr. Cobb, no problem. Cobb is silent.     He and Stump enter. CUT TO: 
133   INT. HALL OF FAME - NIGHT                                    133 The director flips on a     couple lights -- the hall is partially lit. Charles      stays in the b.g., as -- Cobb leads Stump past all the     displays, various shrines and photos and old bats and     balls and records, until -- 
A glass case full of Cobb's things -- his original Detroit Tiger uniform hangs there. Three of his famous "Black Betsy" bats, his glove, a couple balls, and his spikes. Cobb stands in front of the case just staring. Stump stands respectfully a few paces away. Cobb stares at his old uniform. Stump stares at Cobb. 
And Cobb starts crying, softly at first, then swelling until the muffled deep, convulsive sounds become more audible. He starts crying like a baby. 
Stump stands quietly nearby, afraid to move, until, finally: (CONTINUED) 
133   CONTINUED:                                                       133 Cobb sucks up the tears and finally turns to Stump. 
COBB What did you see on that film tonight? 
STUMP I saw Ty Cobb playing baseball. COBB That's all?

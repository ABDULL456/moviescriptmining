Cid stands, balls his fists, SCREAMING at her. Sara pushes back away from him. Maybe a cloud passed over the sun. The room darkens. And we see it now, in her eyes: Sara is afraid. She bolts out of the room. 
EXT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 
Sara walks fast down the hall 
INT. SARA'S BEDROOM 
Not slowing, through her bedroom 
INT. SARA'S CLOSET 
Into her walk-in closet, to a huge steel safe tucked in back. She opens the safe with trembling hands. And climbs inside. 
INT. SAFE 
Closes the heavy door. Turns on a small LED light. And waits. Cid's screams distant but not lessening. 
EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS 
Cid's screams from the house, clear as day. Joe paces in front of the barn. Turns his head back towards the house, not sure what to think. The screams stop. Joe turns uneasily back to the swaying corn. 
INT. CID'S BEDROOM 
The math game scattered, numbered tiles everywhere. Cid lies face down on the bed, cried out. Sara enters quietly. Sits on the bed beside him. Strokes his hair. He folds into her, and they're holding each other tight. 
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY 
A Gat Man named CANADY strolls out of a donut shop, coffee in hand, and gets in his car. 
INT. CANADY'S CAR 
Canady starts the car up, starts driving. 
Somehow not seeing Kid Blue crouched clear as day in the passenger side foot-well. 
KID BLUE Hey Can. Can. Canady sees him, jumps and yelps. The sedan swerves, scrapes to a stop against a parked car. Coffee everywhere. 
CANADY Jesus, fuckin Kid Blue what the 
FUCK 
KID BLUE Pull into that alley. 
CANADY You get the fuck outta 
KID BLUE You don't wanna be seen with me Canady, pull in the alley. Canady glares at him, but pulls the car into a narrow alley, parks it. 
CANADY The fuck are you still doing in town, Abe wants you dead man 
KID BLUE All Abe wants right now is the looper. Unless he got him last night? 
CANADY Jssshhh. No we didn't get him. Spotted and lost him. West End, near Whore's Alley. 
KID BLUE Whore's Alley? 
CANADY That area, Mott & Talbott, little working girl colony. 
KID BLUE (has a thought) Whore's Alley.. 
CANADY You shoulda left town man. 
KID BLUE I'm gonna bring him in, get right with Abe. 
CANADY Yeah, maybe you bring him the looper, but short of that Abe don't get right with priced men. 
KID BLUE I got a price?

Indiana lights a match and finds another oil lamp.  He and Short Round look for a way to open the door that closed behind them, but they have no luck. 
INDIANA Damn! 
Then they hear Willie's voice echoing down the short tunnel. 
WILLIE (O.S.) Hey -- where are you?! 
77.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           77. 
Back in the suite, Willie stands by the entrance to the secret passage, peering into the dark tunnel -- 
WILLIE (Cont'd) Indiana Jones?!  Are you in there?! 
78.    INT.  THE CHAMBER                                              78. 
Indy mutters irritably to himself -- 
INDIANA Yes, we're in here... 
He looks everywhere for something to open the door.  Short Round spots a loose brick and moves it -- 
SHORT ROUND Indy, I found a -- 
Suddenly they hear a rumble and Indy turns to see the opposite wall moving -- the spikes start appearing!  Their lethal points protrude from the wall as it starts closing in toward Indy and Short Round. 
SHORT ROUND (Cont'd) Indy -- ! 
Shorty points up and Indiana sees more spikes descending from the ceiling!  Indy turns toward the door and shouts -- 
INDIANA Uh -- Willie?! (louder) Willie, you better get down here! 
79.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           79. 
Willie listens and looks scared -- 
WILLIE (shouting back) What?! 
INDIANA (O.S.) Willie, come here!  Hurry up, we're in trouble!! 
SHORT ROUND (O.S.) Willie, help!! 
Willie is frightened, confused and jumping around -- 
80.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        80. 
The deadly spikes inch slowly toward them from the wall and ceil- ing.  They start pounding on the door and shout -- 
INDIANA Willie, damn it!  Get down here, NOW 
81.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           81. 
Willie finds the courage to finally whimper and step into the dark passage -- 
WILLIE Oh hell -- I bet I get all dirty again! 
82.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               82. 
Willie starts down the dark tunnel toward the chamber. 
INDIANA (O.S.) WILLIE?! 
WILLIE I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh!  What's that?!  There's stuff all over the floor!  I can't see a thing! 
83.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        83. 
They hear her coming and Indy watches nervously as the spikes draw even closer -- 
INDIANA Move, Willie!  Faster! 
84.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               84. 
Willie crawls and crunches on the littered floor -- 
WILLIE It's all wet and icky!  Aaahh -- things are moving!! 
She sees the low lamp by the door to the chamber. 
SHORT ROUND (O.S.) Please, Willie! 
She grabs the lamp and turns it up so it burns brighter.  She looks around -- and SCREAMS!!  She sees the sickening, swarming mass of glistening insects crawling toward her, attracted by the light -- 
WILLIE (hysterical) There's bugs!  Bugs all over! Help!  Help me! 
INDIANA (O.S.) Willie, open the door!  GET US OUT OF HERE! 
Willie pounds on the door -- 
WILLIE OPEN THE DOOR!  LET ME IN!! 
85.    INT.  THE SPIKE ROOM                                           85. 
The spikes close in --

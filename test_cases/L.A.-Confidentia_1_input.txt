EXLEY (V.O.) Let me out!  That's an order! 
CELL BLOCK 
The Herald Reporter and photographer enter unchaperoned and unnoticed.  Stensland swings like a madman.  That's when a flashbulb goes off.  Freezing everyone in black and white. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY 
The CHIEF sits behind a desk in a four-star uniform. Dudley Smith sits to his left, D.A. Ellis Loew to his right.  Seen earlier at the Mickey Cohen press conference, Loew is the only civilian.  Bud White stands across from them.  There to be judged. 
CHIEF Officer White, you've refused to cooperate with Internal Affairs. But you should know this is bigger than a police board.  Indictments may be handed down.  Quite frankly, we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the Department's image.  Will you testify? 
Bud glances to a gray tinted mirror, then to the Chief. 
BUD No, sir.  I won't. 
The Chief sighs, looks to Loew. 
CHIEF District Attorney Loew. 
Loew steps to Bud, holds up a newspaper with the cell block photo.  The headline:  "BLOODY CHRISTMAS." 
LOEW Bloody Christmas.  The press love to label.  You and Officer Stensland brought the liquor into the precinct.  Stensland was already drunk.  Do you see how appearing as a voluntary witness against him could offset the damage you've done to yourself? 
BUD I won't do it. (staring at mirror) I won't testify against my partner or anyone else. 
LOEW This man is a disgrace. 
CHIEF Your badge and gun, Officer. 
Bud sets them on The Chief's desk. 
CHIEF This is the new L.A.P.D., White. You're suspended from duty and dismissed. 
Turning, White shoots the mirror a stiff middle finger as he makes his way out.  Dudley Smith hides a smile. 
OTHER SIDE OF GLASS 
Exley watches, involuntarily leans back as Bud passes on the other side of the glass. 
THE CHIEF'S OFFICE 
Dudley, Loew and The Chief wait as Exley enters. 
CHIEF Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation? 
EXLEY The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department. 
Dudley gives Exley a look.  He's angry with him. 
DUDLEY Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer. 
EXLEY White's a mindless thug. 
DUDLEY No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time. 
The Chief interrupts with his own concern. 
CHIEF I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, forthright men the public can admire. 
EXLEY I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right. 
CHIEF And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately. 
Exley seizes the moment, going over Dudley's head. 
EXLEY Detective lieutenant. 
The Chief and Dudley exchange a look.  Neither approves. 
CHIEF Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33. 
EXLEY I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective. 
LOEW (interrupting) Before we start polishing our laurels, it would look better if we had a corroborative witness. 
DUDLEY That'll be hard to come by.  The men hate a turncoat. 
EXLEY Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him. 
CHIEF All right, Ed. (into desk intercom) Call Sergeant Vincennes. 
As Exley starts out, Dudley pulls him aside, speaks low. 
DUDLEY You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department? 
EXLEY Yes, Dudley.  I am. 
DUDLEY So be it. 
JACK VINCENNES 
Looking sharp, he strides down the hall, enters the...

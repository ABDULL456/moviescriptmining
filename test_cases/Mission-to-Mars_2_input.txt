They all laugh as the other shoe drops. Luke's expression is incredulous, exasperated. 
COTE Oui. Exactement! It's Kirov's fault, he picked today's sector. 
KIROV Hey, c'mon! We've got a scientific duty to check that thing out. 
Luke sits, taking over the Ares remote control from Cote. They all watch as he fine tunes the image, trying without success to coax more resolution. 
LUKE Great. That's great. The first anomaly we hit, and it's gotta be in the one place guaranteed to make NASA look ridiculous... You know how many books have been written about that damned mountain? 
COTE The Egyptians put it there. 
KIROV No, the Amazons. 
WILLIS No, it was little green men! 
LUKE And all because a couple of lousy impact craters happen to look like eye sockets. If this gets out, we'll have every UFO kook on Earth spouting off on the six o'clock news... C'mon, people, gimme a read here. Is that a cinder cone? 
KIROV Nah, too smooth. Too angular. Volcanic upwelling? 
COTE No fissures. No caldera. 
LUKE It's an upwelling, for sure. But maybe not volcanic... 
The others look at him, puzzled. Luke leans in closer, with growing excitement. He points to the screen. 
LUKE Look at the color. And see how shiny it is? I could swear that's ice... 
COTE This far south? 
WILLIS Impossible. You can't have ice at this latitude. Not unless... 
They look at each other, Luke's excitement now leaping from one to another of them. They're almost trembling. 
WILLIS Oh my God. 
LUKE How far away is it? 
KIROV Sixteen kilometers northeast. Take us twenty minutes to get there. 
LUKE (considers a moment) Let's send a packet to Micker. Then we'll go check it out. 
EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY 
AIRLOCK DOORS 
Slide back, REVEALING the crew in EVA suits, carrying gear. They walk over to... 
THE FOUR-MAN ROVER 
The astronauts climb in through the hatch. The last one in pulls it shut behind him and locks the latches. We see Cote and Luke check their screens and press some buttons. Luke puts the rover in drive. 
WIDER ANGLE, PULLING UP AND AWAY 
As the rover moves off across the rocky surface, dust kicking up from the wheels, we get our first exterior glimpse of the Mars One Base Camp. The main HAB UNIT looks like a huge tuna can with a conical top section; it connects to a separate, inflated-bubble GREENHOUSE. There's also an OXYGEN STILL, PROPELLANT PLANT, and, on the other side, a couple hundred meters distant, the massive ERV (Earth Return Vehicle), which arrived as a separate, unmanned flight. 
Rows of SOLAR PANELS, arrayed on the ground, and an AMERICAN FLAG on a thin pole, about man-height, complete the scene. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISP). EARTH ORBIT. DAY 
A vast, impressive, MULTI-SECTIONED SPACECRAFT is drifting majestically above Earth. The main hull displays both NASA and U.N. flag decals. 
SUPER TITLE: "INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. MARS MISSION CONTROL ROOM (MMCR). 20 MINUTE TIME LAG." 
We MOVE IN towards another of the station's segments, which is dedicated entirely (as we see from more labels and insignias) to the Mars Program: Control Room, Training and Living Quarters, and a Vehicle Docking and Launch Area, where Mars Two is already positioned for its eventual flight. We hear LUKE'S EXCITED VOICE, over speakers. 
LUKE This is a truly anomalous formation. Looks like nothing we've seen so far. The structure appears to be crystalline, at least from the angle displayed by ARES-8 ... 
INT. MMCR. DAY 
On a large CENTER DISPLAY SCREEN, we see Luke and the Mars One crew, sitting around their kitchen table in the Hab, finishing lunch while taping this VIDEO MESSAGE. 
LUKE (grins) We're all trying not to go too nuts up here, but -- we think there's a good chance this could be an extrusion from some subsurface, geothermal column of water. And if we're right... 
He looks at his crew. They beam like cats who ate canaries. 
LUKE ...then we've found the key to permanent human colonization. 
IN THE MMCR 
There's an EXCITED BUZZ among the assembled TECHNICIANS, FLIGHT ENGINEERS, and SCIENTISTS. This would be a fantastic, epochal discovery. 
MCCONNELL 
Sits at the center console, wearing a headset. He's now the Mars One CAPCOM (Capsule Communicator), and his manner is brisk, efficient, all-business. A TECHNICIAN leans in for instructions. 
MCCONNELL Tell geology and hydrology we need to scramble on this. Full-court press. 
The technician nods, hurries away. McConnell, sharing the intense excitement of those around him, stares up at 
THE SCREEN 
Where Luke and his crew are still smiling, well knowing the excitement their bombshell will create. 
LUKE Anyway, we'are going out to take a closer look at it, try to get an idea of its composition. (checks his watch) By the time you receive this, we should be just about on-site. 
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY

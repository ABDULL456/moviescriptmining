Gregg picks up a glass of champagne for Jill and starts crossing the room to her. 
CECILY Shut your mouth, Harry -- you're catching flies. 
ON JILL 
Feeling terribly insecure, Jill gratefully watches Gregg cross the room towards her. They can't take their eyes off each other. When he reaches her side, she grabs on to him. 
JILL (self-conscious) Tell me the truth -- do I look stupid in this? Everyone is staring at me. 
GREGG (reassuring) They're not staring at you. (looks around) They're staring at that... uh... banana tower. 
Jill turns and sees a ridiculous-looking decorative mountain of bananas sitting on a table top just behind her. It's the creation of an over-zealous caterer. 
Jill blushes, realizing Gregg's joking.

JILL Very funny. 
ACROSS ROOM 
Strasser and Garth observe the crowd. 
GARTH Quite a turnout they have here. 
STRASSER All the better. 
BAKER (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please? 
Strasser puts his drink down, taps Garth. 
STRASSER Let's go. 
The two of them head for the exit. 
AT PODIUM - WITH BAKER 
BAKER When was the last time you laid eyes on something so unique, so spectacular, that it literally took your breath away? Well, prepare yourselves, for tonight you will have such an experience. 
WITH STRASSER AND GARTH 
Heading for the exit, they hear Baker's words and exchange a knowing glance -- if they have their way, tonight will be more of an "experience" than Baker is bargaining for. Garth slips his hand into his jacket, checking for the dog collar... 
Just as Jack and Vern start coming the other way. Jack's already had one glass too many, and he's reckless on his feet. 
JACK (to Vern) There's nothing in this punch, man. I could drink twelve of these and not feel a thing. 
(CONTINUED) 
76   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                  76 
Smack! Jack collides with Garth, causing Garth to drop the dog collar. Vern stoops to retrieve it, (picking it up by a rusty key that is one of the clanking objects on the collar). 
VERN Sorry!   Here's your... uh... key chain. 
Garth grabs it back.      Strasser nods coolly to Vern and Jack. 
STRASSER Thank you. 
Vern and Jack stumble on, none the wiser. 
Strasser and Garth slip out. 
77   EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - CONTINUOUS ACTION                             77 
Joe is feeding on bamboo in the center of his habitat when something abruptly catches his ear. A slight JANGLING sound, the TIMPANI of WIND CHIMES, floating through the air. It GROWS LOUDER. 
Joe stands up. The hair on his neck bristles. He moves towards the source of the sound, at the edge of the moat. 
JOE'S POV 
Garth stands at the railing surrounding the moat, rattling the dog collars. It's a sound that haunts him, from the darkest depths of his memory. He starts to GROWL and then he sees something that really drives him nuts. 
Strasser steps into the light, joining Garth by the water's edge. He rattles the dog collar, and now... 
ZOOM IN ON JOE 
His eyes, locking with Strasser's. His pupils narrow, his nostrils flare, and Joe FREAKS OUT! 
He starts tearing up the ground, beating his chest, then he ROARS and charges straight for them, stopping at the water's edge. 
(CONTINUED) 
77   CONTINUED:                                                     77 
ON STRASSER 
locking eyes with Joe. This is the first time he has seen Joe since the animal bit his hand off twelve years ago. A smile creeps across his face. 
STRASSER (to himself) So you haven't forgotten me.   Good. (holding up his dead hand) Have you forgotten this? 
Garth is still rattling the dog collar, enjoying Joe's display of rage. 
GARTH What do you think the big guy is worth? A couple million? 
STRASSER I will get that for the paws alone. After we sell him off piece by piece, who knows how much we'll make? 
Garth shakes the dog collar more furiously, making Joe rush at them again. 
GARTH Got you going now! That should rattle the jewelry off the ladies. 
STRASSER (indicating dog collar) Hang it there -- where he can see it. (warning) And come back for it -- after. 
Garth hangs the dog collar on the fence. Joe can hear it clank in the breeze -- he is in a truly frightening state. 
STRASSER Come, we've done our job here.

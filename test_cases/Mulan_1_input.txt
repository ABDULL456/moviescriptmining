Yao, Ling and Chien-Po [rushing toward Mulan]:  Noooooo! 
Chi Fu [putting his hand to stop Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po from proceeding further]:  You know the law. 
[Shang stands over Mulan.  Mulan looks at Shang then bows her head in anticipation.  Shang lifts the sword high above his head and throws it down in front of Mulan] 
Shang:  A life for a life.  My debt is repaid.  [turns and walks towards the Imperial City]  Move out! 
Chi Fu [coming up to Shang's face]:  But you can't just... 
Shang [getting in Chi Fu's face]:  I said, "Move out!" 
[The troops walk off toward the Imperial City leaving Mulan behind with Khan, Cri-Kee, and Mushu.  Mulan is sitting, shivering. Khan takes his blanket and wraps it around Mulan with his mouth and sits behind her.  Cri-Kee lights a fire with twigs.  When he doesn't get warm, he moves under the blanket wrapped around Mulan.  Mushu walks toward Mulan carrying a stick] 
Mushu:  I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, an entourage.  Man, all my fine work, ffft.  [Mushu picks up a dumpling with his stick, slumps down in front of the fire Cri-Kee made and begins to cook the dumpling over the fire] [glancing up] Hi. 
Mulan [look of sadness]:  I should never have left home. 
Mushu:  Eh, come on, you wanted to save your father's life.  Who knew you'd end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors, and losing all your friends.  You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn to let these things go [looking as if he's about to cry]. 
Mulan:  Maybe I didn't go for my father.  Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right.  So when I looked in the mirror [picking up her helmet and looking at her reflection in her helmet] I'd see someone worthwhile.  But I was wrong.  I see nothing.  [throws the helmet down and a tear runs down her cheek] 
Mushu [picking up the helmet and spitting on it]:  Well that's because this just needs a little spit, that's all.  Let me shine this up for ya [wiping the spit to clean the helmet and holding it up to Mulan].   I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty.  [seeing Mulan is not cheered up by his actions, he shows sorrow on his face]  The truth is we're both frauds.  Your ancestors never sent me, they don't even like me.  I mean, you risked your life to help people you love.  I risked your life to help myself.  At least you had good intentions  [Mulan smiles]. 
Cri-Kee [jumping on top of the helmet beginning to bawl]:  Chirp, Chirp, Chirp.  Bawl, Bawl. 
Mushu:  What!?  What do you mean you're not lucky?  You lied to me?  [Cri-Kee nods] [to Khan]  And what are you? A sheep? 
Mulan [sadly]:  I'll have to face my father sooner or later.  Let's go home. 
Mushu:  Yeah, this ain't gonna be pretty.  But, don't you worry, 'kay?  Things'll work out.  We started this thing together and that's how we'll finish. [Mushu hugs Mulan.  Mulan smiles]  I promise. 
[Cut to Shan-Yu's falcon flying over the avalanche site.  Shan-Yu's hand pops out of the snow.  He gets up and glances around] 
Shan-Yu [screaming]:  Rrrrrrraaaaaaaaahhh!

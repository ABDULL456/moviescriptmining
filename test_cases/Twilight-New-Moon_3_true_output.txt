BELLA (V.O.) But I'm sure it's better for them, not having me around... 
INT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME (CONTINOUS) - DAY 
Alice faces off with Carlisle as the others watch on. Esme desolate; Emmett blank. He sits next to Rosalie who seems almost irritated. Jasper isolates himself in a corner. 
CARLISLE No.   We promised Edward. 
ALICE But she won't do well without us. I get flashes of her, but they're unclear -- 
ROSALIE Forget her, let's drag Edward home. 
ESME He'll come back when he's ready. After Bella moves on. 
CARLISLE Yes. When she's living her life, safe from danger -- 
JASPER (with self-contempt) You mean safe from us. 
Alice wraps an arm around Jasper, soothingly. 
ROSALIE (pointedly to Alice) And when will that be? 
EMMETT Can you see him, Alice? They all turn to Alice... a beat. She closes her eyes, trying to get a lock on Edward -- PUSH IN ON ALICE as -- 
ALICE The only decision he's made... 
SMASH TO: 
EXT. SOUTH AMERICA - ANDES (ALICE'S VISION) - DAY 
(Visuals are jumpy, unclear) START HIGH ON A MOUNTAINTOP in the middle of nowhere. SWOOP DOWN to its peak on which we find EDWARD. Standing still, face agonized. 
ALICE (O.S.) ... is to be alone... 
-- and suddenly, he starts running, like he's trying to outrun his memories, faster and faster -- he races toward a CLIFF; a RAVINE hundreds of feet below -- Edward doesn't slow, just blasts forward faster; then he LEAPS off the cliff, FLOATING, but the pain stays with him -- 
ON EDWARD'S FEET landing hard on the other side of the ravine - as they hit ground we -- 
SMASH BACK TO: 
CLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGERS 
-- as they hit computer keys -- 
BELLA (V.O.) Time passes. Every tick that goes by... aches... 
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
INCLUDE BELLA'S COMPUTER SCREEN, as she types... 
BELLA (V.O.) Like the pulse of blood behind a bruise... 
Bella stops. A beat as she stares at her own words.   Then she hits "select all" and "delete" -- 
ON THE COMPUTER - A BLANK DOCUMENT. She types: "Hi Mom, things are great, grades are up. Hanging with friends. Stop worrying. I'm fine." 
Bella presses "send", and the cheery e-mail disappears. Bella rises, returns to her rocking chair, staring out desolately. PUSH PAST HER OUTSIDE... 
AN UNKNOWN POV FROM THE WOODS - ON BELLA IN THE WINDOW 
-- Someone's watching her, pacing menacingly, hungrily... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Bella exits to find Charlie out by the street, stuffing trash into the bins. He talks with neighbor, Bob Marks, who also attends to his trash: two old, beat up motorcycles. 
CHARLIE It's about time you got rid of those, Bob. Seen one too many bikers smeared on the highway. 
BOB Save the lecture, Chief. Soon as the garbage truck hauls `em off, you and my wife can rest easy. (starts off, but stops) Oh, hey, what's the word on that bear problem? Folks are saying they're huge. 
CHARLIE (distracted) That's just... talk... 
-- as Charlie watches Bella walk to her truck, head down. Bob sees her, too -- 
BOB How you doin' there, Bella? 
Bella, in her own world, doesn't respond.   Bob gives Charlie an understanding shrug and heads off. 
ON BELLA as she opens her truck door.   Suddenly, it gets slammed shut again by Charlie. 
CHARLIE That's it. 
BELLA That's what?

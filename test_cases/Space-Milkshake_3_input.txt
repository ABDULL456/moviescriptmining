TILDA I'm accessing Wendi's backup system. JIMMY I mean what are you doing with that RS232 cable? Numbers flash on the screen. WENDI (O.S.) Hello Tilda. TILDA Hello Wendi. Central logic processor is up. All systems are online - the control interface has been disconnected. Tilda keeps accessing the computer with her brain. TILDA (CONT'D) It was the duck. JIMMY Gary? What is it trying to do? TILDA Look. The monitor shows a wire-frame diagram of the space station in motion, with trajectories and readings. A red circular line indicates the orbit of the station, and it intersects with Earth. The little icon of the station is slowly moving on that line toward the `red zone'. "WARNING" text blinks. TILDA (CONT'D) The station's orbit has been altered. We're going to hit the atmosphere. JIMMY How long do we have? TILDA About twenty eight minutes. JIMMY Are you sure? She's sure. Jimmy hits the intercom. JIMMY (CONT'D) Anton? Anton? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   68. 
TILDA The intercoms are locked out. We have to get to the control room. Tilda turns away, unplugs the cable with a shiver and pulls the cable out of her pants. She zips up. JIMMY You're going to have to explain that later. Tilda reaches her hand toward Jimmy. Jimmy puts his hand out. A spark jumps between their hands. JIMMY (CONT'D) Ow! TILDA Oh Jimmy. You don't have a static discharge buffer. You're completely made of meat. JIMMY Meat that loves you, Tilda. TILDA It may not be possible for us to overcome our physiological differences in this universe. JIMMY It sure would be fun to try. Tilda smiles in agreement. 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Valentina looks under the communications equipment. There's a half-open compartment at the end of the room, filled with deep shadows. A wall panel is also open. She moves slowly toward it. She peeks in the wall panel. It's empty. She moves on toward the other compartment. Valentina reaches slowly toward the open compartment, her heart racing. VALENTINA Gary? Are you there Gary? We have to talk. She opens the compartment - just a pair of dusty headphones inside. She relaxes. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   69. 
Jimmy runs in, startling her. She bangs her head on the control panel. VALENTINA (CONT'D) AHHHH! JIMMY AHHHHHH! Valentina punches his face. VALENTINA AHHHH! JIMMY OW! VALENTINA What are you doing? JIMMY Ow. Stop. VALENTINA You scared the crap out of me. JIMMY Where's Anton? VALENTINA We split up. What are you doing here? JIMMY We're falling out of orbit. Gary's done something to the guidance system. Have you found him? VALENTINA He's not between here and engineering. JIMMY Then there's only one place left he could be. 
INT. CREW QUARTERS ~ VALENTINA'S ROOM - NIGHT Anton is looking at shady spots under the sleeping cots, holding the elliptical machine handle as a club. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   70. 
The room is full of dark corners; each one seems to hold the promise of aliens bursting out. Anton explores cautiously. TILDA (O.S.) Anton! Anton spins around. Tilda points past him. Anton looks. The rubber duck is on the shelf! Anton smashes it with the handle! ANTON Got it! He stomps on it. Squeak Squeak. Squeak. TILDA That's not it. ANTON Oh. Anton lifts his foot. It squeaks. ANTON (CONT'D) It's the normal one. A SCUTTLING SOUND behind them. They turn and look. TILDA Did you hear that? Anton goes to her. They catch a glimpse of tentacle poking out of Anton's room. It disappears around the corner. TILDA (CONT'D) It's horrible. ANTON Tilda, get back. He hands her the backpack with the Time Cube. Tilda takes it and backs away.

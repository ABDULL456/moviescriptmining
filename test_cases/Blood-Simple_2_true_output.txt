MEURICE ...Why do you think I'm retired. 
He grimaces. 
MEURICE ...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved. 
ABBY No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead-- 
MEURICE What?! Did Ray tell you that? 
ABBY Sort of... 
Meurice sits her down on the sofa. 
MEURICE That's total bullshit. Marty called me after he was jacked up... 
He tries to coax her into lying down. 
MEURICE ...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead. 
ABBY Meurice-- 
MEURICE You don't look too good. You sleep last night? 
Her head meets an end cushion. 
ABBY Meurice, you gotta help me... 
Meurice rises from the sofa, sighs. 
MEURICE All right. Just sit tight. Try to get some sleep... 
He leans down to the table next to the sofa. 
MEURICE ...I'll find Marty, find out what's going on. 
CLOSE SHOT  ABBY 
Her head on the cushion. We hear engine rumble. Abby twists her head back, following Meurice. As we hear the table lamp being switched off we: 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY  NIGHT 
POV FROM A CAR 
The engine rumble continues over the cut. There is no other traffic on the highway. A light fog covers the road. A green highway sign says: "San Antonio 73 mi." We hear a car radio playing softly. 
CLOSE SHOT  RAY 
Driving. He is gently lit by the light from the dashboard. He reaches forward to turn off the radio. The only sound now is the hum of the engine and the rhythmic clomping of tires on pavement. The look and sound of the scene are close to those of the first scene of the movie. 
Ray takes a cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth, but leaves it unlit. 
RAY'S POV 
The headlights of an approaching car materialize in the fog. The car passes with a roar. 
Up ahead a traffic light is turning amber. 
BACK TO RAY 
The engine hum drops as he slows. We hear the low engine rumble and the squeaking brakes of another car. Ray is now stopped in front of the deserted intersection. He looks up in his rearview mirror. 
RAY'S POV 
Another car is stopped just behind him, the fog floating up past its headlights. The headlights halate in the fog; none of the rest of the car is visible. 
BACK TO RAY 
The unlit cigarette still in his mouth. He looks down from the rearview mirror to the intersection ahead of him. There is a long pause, during which we hear only the steady purr of Ray's car and the knocking rumble of the car behind him. 
Ray looks up at the traffic light. 
RAY'S POV 
The light is just turning from red to green. 
CLOSE SHOT  RAY'S FOOT ON BRAKE 
He takes his foot off the brake, hesitates for a moment, the replaces it on the brake.

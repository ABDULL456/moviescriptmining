KAY Yeah, I know they are, buddy. But you're doing good work here. We need you. A knock at the door -- Warhol gets back into character -- 
WARHOL I'll be right there... I'm just... filming these men eating a hamburger... It's... transcendent. Okay, now the pickle... (back to cop form) You see what I mean? And who the hell's this guy? New partner? 
JAY Actually, I'm his old partner. I came from the future to warn him 
ABOUT-- 
WARHOL Jesus, fine, don't tell me. Alright, what do you need? 
JAY We're looking for a recent arrival. Long hair, wears a lot of leather... Warhol indicates the party below -- half the guests match that description. 
WARHOL You'll have to do better than that. Look, if that's all you have, I can't help you. 
KAY Maybe you know someone who's seen something. 
STAR (O.S.) Andy, the horse is here... 
WARHOL I gotta get back in there-- 
JAY Hold up -- the guy we're looking for -- he's out to destroy the world. 
WARHOL C'mon, what's new? What does an MiE call it when someone tries to destroy the world? Tuesday. 
JAY I thought you made that up. 
KAY C'mon, W, I got a feeling on this one. Like we should take it serious. And we don't have much time. Jay checks his watch. 
JAY 33 hours. 
WARHOL Yeah, yeah, alright. 
(THINKS) Okay, talk to Prell and Vidal. C'mon. 
IN THE PARTY ON TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - in very 60s fashion with incredibly giant hair - one with a big afro, one with big chignon hairdo. 
WARHOL (O.S.) (back in "character") Vidal, Prell, can you please talk to these nice men? The women's LIPS DON'T MOVE -- they respond in incongruously 
GRUFF VOICES: 
PRELL Whadaya want? 
VIDAL They look like cops to me. ain't talking. 
PRELL We're not rats. We swing around them to REVEAL that Warhol/Kay/Jay are not talking to the women's faces -- They're STANDING BEHIND THE WOMEN -- TALKING TO THEIR HAIR- DO'S which we realize are two COMPLETE HAIR ALIENS, VIDAL and PRELL, perched atop these women. 
KAY Start talking, you two, before you end up on a barber's floor. 
PRELL Ah, you don't scare me. 
KAY Yeah? Kay reaches into a passing woman's purse, pulls out HAIRSPRAY. Grab some of Prell and holds up the spray. 
PRELL You wouldn't! He sprays the hair, it starts to SCREAM IN PAIN.

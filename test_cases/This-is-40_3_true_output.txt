Jason and Ronnie are talking to Desi. 
DESI So what's your sun sign? 
RONNIE Libra. 
JASON Oh, boy. 
DESI That's not good. 
JASON No, sir. 
DESI Not for me, that's not good. Sexually we are completely incompatible. 
RONNIE That's not true. 
JASON That's such a shame. That's as bad as it gets. 
DESI What's yours? 
JASON I'm a Cancer. 
DESI Really? 
JASON Is that good? 
RONNIE What does it mean? 
DESI That's really strange. Well, Taurus and Cancers are sort of soul mates of the Zodiac. We're like perfectly compatible. I balance what you lack, and you make up for what I lack. And a quiet Cancer almost always has a huge penis. 
JASON (quietly) You're making me embarrassed. 
EXT. BACKYARD - LATER 
Debbie, Pete, Larry, Oliver, Barb and Barry are eating. 
DEBBIE I wanted to make a toast. Thank you guys so much for coming... Pete's turning forty. 
PETE Weird. 
DEBBIE And we're ready to start this new phase of our lives with open hearts. Ready to just choose joy and forgive everybody, so thank you all for coming. 
LARRY Wait. Forgive who? 
PETE I think she just meant generally. You know? Put the past behind us. 
DEBBIE And live without resentments. 
LARRY But specifically who are you forgiving? I like to know the details before I toast. 
DEBBIE Well, you and my dad and others. 
LARRY I see. I know you have some issues with me, but I'm curious, what's he in for? Before today nobody even knew he existed. 
DEBBIE My parents divorced when I was really young and we don't spend that much time together and I'd like to work on that. Just like we'd like to work on how you have financial issues. 
BARRY (to Larry) She means all the lending. And the borrowing... 
LARRY I know what she meant. 
EXT. POOLSIDE - CONTINUOUS 
Ronnie, Jason, and Desi talk. 
JASON You are a beautiful woman, but you are not totally maxed out. I would say honestly, you're a six. Six and a half. I could make you an eleven. 
DESI Really? 
JASON When I found Deb, she was a seven. And now she's a twelve. 
DESI I want to be a twelve. 
JASON You can't be lazy. 
DESI I don't want to be lazy. 
JASON Look at me. You cannot be lazy. 
DESI I won't be lazy. 
JASON Do you know how she got her body? Bodies By Jason. 
DESI Wow. 
JASON Say it. 
DESI Bodies By Jason. 
JASON Say it again. 
DESI Bodies By Jason. 
JASON And now just say Jason. 
DESI Jason. 
JASON Again? 
DESI (whispers) Jason. 
JASON That sounds right, doesn't it? 
DESI Yeah. 
RONNIE What the fuck is happening right now?

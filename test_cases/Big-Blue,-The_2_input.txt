Dead silence. 
ENZO is the only one with no plate in front of him. Signora MOLINARI'S eyebrows condense into a dark stripe across her forehead. 
JOHANA hands ENZO'S plate to the WAITER and takes the full one. 
JOHANA (to waiter) Thank you. 
And begins to eat, ignoring the expressions of amazement all around her. 
MAMMA MOLINARI Americana? 
JOHANA nods enthusiastically, her mouth too full to speak. 
MAMMA MOLINARI (impressed, to Johana) Benvenuto! 
MAMMA MOLINARI has a huge grin on her face. 
EXT.  TAORMINA STREET - JACQUES, JOHANA - TWILIGHT 
They emerge onto the street in front of the entrance of a small rooming house. 
JACQUES is carrying JOHANA'S luggage.  The old pension is covered in bright pink bougainvilliers, there is laundry hanging on the other side of the street. 
JOHANA Thanks for helping with the bag. (she looks up at the pension with little enthusiasm) It looks great! 
JACQUES I thought it was a nice place. (suddenly doubting) Isn't it? 
JOHANA I'm being a pain in the ass. (looking at him) It's beautiful here. 
They look at each other.  JACQUES is silent.  He just stands there, a suitcase in each hand. 
JOHANA breaks the silence. 
JOHANA You're going to be very busy these days aren't you? 
JACQUES I don't know... why? 
JOHANA Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you. (feeling she has gone too far) But you are going to be very busy. You must have tons of things to prepare, interviews... And a competition like this one must require a great deal of concentration, right? 
JACQUES (shakes his head negatively) Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think? 
JOHANA (with a faint smile) I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best? 
JACQUES Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous? 
He looks up at her as he pronounces the last word.  She smiles at him, lovingly. 
JOHANA (laughing) You can put down the suitcases, you know. 
He lets go of the suitcases.  Suddenly, behind them, there is a loud screech of tires.  The FIAT tears across the street. 
ENZO in his FIAT.  He pokes his head out of the window. 
ENZO C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion. 
JACQUES I'm a little tired, I don't know if... 
ENZO Get in the car! 
INT.  ENZO'S SUITE - ENZO, JACQUES, ROBERTO - NIGHT 
They're in front of a wardrobe looking JACQUES over in the full-length mirrors.  He's wearing an evening shirt and a tuxedo of ENZO'S.  The collar is too big, the sleeves hangover his hands.  He looks at himself dubiously in the mirror. 
ENZO Roberto!  The bow-tie! 
ROBERTO hands ENZO the bow-tie, he hooks it around JACQUES' collar. 
ENZO (taking a few steps back) Very good. 
JACQUES looks down at his tennis shoes. 
ROBERTO What about the shoes? 
ENZO Very chic. (hesitates) Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you? 
JACQUES No. 
ENZO Then, it's very chic.  Avanti! 
EXT.  RECEPTION ON TERRACE - NIGHT 
A big reception is organized on the terrace of the hotel. The official divers and technicians are all gathered in front of a podium.  The terrace is loaded with photographers. 
ROBERTO keeps turning round and round the long buffet table. 
JACQUES is alone at the bar.  Incongruous detail:  a whiskey bottle on the table beside him. 
JOHANA enters.  She has also had a few drinks. 
JOHANA I thought you'd be at the dinner.

Mars takes a carton of eggs and a package of hot dogs from the refrigerator -- 
MARS With hot sauce and butter. 
Jennifer takes a bowl from the cupboard.  When she sets down the bowl, she sees the handle of the paring knife by the food processor.  Jennifer breaks eggs into the bowl -- 
JENNIFER I need a frying pan.  Would you get one? Over there, under the range. 
As soon as Mars turns away, Jennifer palms the knife and pushes it into the waist of her shorts -- 
EXT. THE CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT 
Talley joins Maddox behind the car -- 
MADDOX What put a wild hair up your ass? 
TALLEY I changed my mind.  That's all you need to know. 
Talley picks up the dedicated crisis phone that's been cut into the Smiths' telephone line.  He lifts the receiver and presses a button.  The phone inside the house rings -- 
Intercut Dennis inside Smith's office.  He answers -- 
DENNIS That you, Talley? 
TALLEY The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis. 
DENNIS You oughta try on the problem I got in here. 
TALLEY I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith. 
Dennis shoots a nervous glance at Walter, who's twitching and shuddering on the couch -- 
DENNIS We been through that.  Forget it. 
TALLEY We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him. 
Maddox can't believe that Talley is saying this -- 
MADDOX (low, so that Dennis can't hear) What in hell are you doing?! 
DENNIS That's bullshit!  The guy's right here! He's alive! 
TALLEY (pressing Dennis harder) If you don't let me talk to him, they're going to attack the house. 
Maddox grabs Talley's arm, his voice a low hiss -- 
MADDOX You're gonna set him off, goddamnit! That's crazy! 
DENNIS (screaming) They better not! 
Talley pushes Maddox away and amps the pressure on Dennis -- 
TALLEY Help me keep them out!  Let me speak to Smith, Dennis.  Let me speak to him right now. 
Dennis is freaking.  He believes that the Sheriffs are about to crash through the doors -- 
DENNIS SHIT!!!! 
Now Talley throttles back; he senses that Dennis is at the breaking point and wants to coax him back from the edge -- 
TALLEY (calmer; coaxing) Talk to me, Dennis.  Help me help you. Why can't you put Smith on the phone? 
Dennis finally makes the admission -- 
DENNIS (quietly) He got knocked out.  It's like he's sleeping.  He just lays there. 
Talley gives a thumbs-up to Maddox, who sits back in awe. This crazy shit is working -- 
TALLEY (to Dennis) Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that. 
DENNIS Okay. 
TALLEY Let me come get him. 
DENNIS Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me! 
TALLEY If you won't let me come in, then put him outside. 
DENNIS You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door! 
TALLEY You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court. 
Dennis is at the edge; he's looking straight down into his deepest fears.  He finally relents -- 
DENNIS Fuck you, Talley, fuck you!  You and one other guy, but that's it!  I want you stripped!  I gotta know you don't have guns! 
Dennis slams down the phone -- 
Talley lowers the crisis phone, then looks at Maddox -- 
TALLEY Bring up the ambulance. 
EXT. THE CUL-DE-SAC -- A FEW MINUTES LATER

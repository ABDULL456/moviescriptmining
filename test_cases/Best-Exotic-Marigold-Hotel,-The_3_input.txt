14 INT. SALON - DAY 14 
Jean whom we earlier saw looking at the bungalow, is at the hairdressers. Her stylist ABI listens to her reading a computer printout for the same hotel. Which looks classy, elegant, and welcoming. Madge's voice bleeds into Jean's.

15 EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY 15 
In the background, a train rumbles along the Piccadilly Line towards Heathrow. Douglas, Jean's husband, is on the green with his friend SIMON. Douglas is lining up a tricky putt. 
SIMON There won't be any golf courses. 
DOUGLAS Just as well. I can't afford the green fees. 
SIMON But a retirement home? Douglas misses his putt. 
DOUGLAS It's a luxury development, where all the residents are in their golden years. 
SIMON Like the Costa Brava. 
DOUGLAS Yes. But with more elephants. Simon holes out. 
16 INT. JUDGES CHAMBERS - DAY 16 
Graham, the judge, is in his office. It's nearly empty; his entire life is being packed away. His friend Giles watches him put more things in boxes. 
GILES How long have we known each other? And you've never once talked about India. 
GRAHAM D'you want these books? 
GILES You might need them again. Graham smiles at him, calls out. 
GRAHAM Mrs Megson! His cleaner, MRS MEGSON, comes in. 
MRS MEGSON Sir? Graham takes a beautiful vase off the shelf, gives it to her. 
GRAHAM I want you to have this. 
MRS MEGSON Are you sure? 
GRAHAM Absolutely. There's a slight crack on the bottom. But I think you might know something about that already. Mrs Megson goes. 
GRAHAM (CONT'D) I used to live there. A long time ago. 
17 INT. BASEMENT BEDSIT. EARLS COURT - DAY 17 
A bedsit. Slightly down at heel, and sparsely furnished. Norman, whom we met speed dating, is talking to someone. We don't see who. Quietly, in the background, Radio 2 music from an old battery radio. 
NORMAN I have to go. I do. And I could say I wish you'd come, but I've never lied to you. We both know I need more than you can offer. We know that. Don't we? We see who's sitting in front of him. An ancient dachshund. 
NORMAN (CONT'D) (to the dog) Don't make that face at me. Norman's Polish landlady, MRS JELLINEK, is at the door. 
MRS JELLINEK (to her dog) You. Upstairs. The dog hops off the chair, and leaves. Norman watches him go. MRS JELLINEK (cont'd) Any warm clothes you have use for no more, I take them. And not forget to leave keys when you go. She leaves. Norman is left alone. 
NORMAN I'll miss you too. 
18 EXT. HOUSING ESTATE - DAY 18 
The district ambulance driver, JACKSON, is pushing Muriel in a wheelchair across a housing estate. 
MURIEL You know who'll be there, don't you? Indians. Loads of them, A sea of brown faces and black hearts, all greasy haired and reeking of spices. Never see one on their own, do you? No, becuase they hunt in packs. All the better to rob me blind and - 
JACKSON You know what? You can take it from here. 
MURIEL You're supposed to see me into my flat. That's what they said. 
JACKSON My wife is from Mumbai. He heads off. Muriel shouts after him. 
MURIEL No good moaning to me, mate. You married her! But he's gone. Muriel wheels herself on over the bumpy ground.

HOG-HEAD Yeah, I put too much Hollandaise on the mozzarella sticks. 
GARY Why don't you just back one out here? 
HOG-HEAD I'm pretty sure I'm gonna need a bath afterwards. 
Baker musters some initiative and STANDS UP. 
BAKER Come on, you guys! I say we go to a strip club and smoke cigars-- that 11 wake us up! 
RICK I got a better idea. Rick STRETCHES. 
RICK (CONT'D) Let's go night-night. 
BAKER What? 
RICK I say we tie a bow on it and put her to bed. This is gonna be a long week so we should pace ourselves. Baker looks at his watch. 
BAKER It's only nine-thirty! 
FRED I'm with Rico. 
(YAWNS) Freddy tie-tie. 
GARY 
(DISAPPOINTED) Are you guys serious? 
RICK Relax, guys, this is just the calm before the storm. Get out the plywood and batten down the hatches. 
FRED That's right. Tonight we build up strength, tomorrow we make landfall. 
SMASH CUT TO: Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER: 
DAY 2 
EXT. GOLF COURSE - MORNING 
Rick, Fred, Hog-head, and Gary are stretching on the first tee of a local FOUR-STAR GOLF RESORT while taking in the sights. Nearby, we see the hotel swimming pool lined with ATTRACTIVE WOMEN in bikinis. 
HOG-HEAD Wow. This place sure beats the hell out of the Holiday Inn Express. Why aren't you staying here? 
RICK Too pricey. Besides, since we're paying for golf we get full access to the resort--including the pool bar. 
FRED Mothers, lock up your daughters-- the dogs are off the leash! 
RICK Turn-and-burn, baby! Gary raises his hand for a HIGH-FIVE, but Rick balks. 
RICK (CONT'D) Nope. I don't do that. 
HOG-HEAD Hey, I say screw the golf--let's go straight to the pool bar and start getting you guys laid! 
RICK Hoch-head, relax, the pool bar ain't going nowhere. Besides, it'll be good for us to get a little sun before making our grand entrance-- chicks love a healthy glow. 
FRED Plus it wouldn't hurt to work up a little sweat--get those pheromones flying. Just then, two sexy BEER-CART GIRLS wave as they pass. 
HOG-HEAD You talked me into it. 
GARY Hey, guys, look what I brought. Gary holds up a ZIPLOCK BAG full of something chocolatey. 
RICK What's that? 
GARY Pot brownskies. The guys all look at one another, baffled. 
RICK What, are we on spring break? Where the hell'd you get those? 
GARY I got an in. 
FRED With who? 
GARY Guy who washes my dog. Go ahead. He holds out the bag and the guys hesitate. 
GARY (CONT'D) Eating it isn't like smoking it. It's a much mellower buzz--you'll just feel relaxed. 
HOG-HEAD Are they chocolatey? As Hog-Head SNIFFS the brownies, Rick takes a practice swing. 
RICK Hog-head, come on, who eats pot brownies at eleven in the morning when they're playing golf? 
HOG-HEAD John Daly? 
GARY And by the way, Rick, this is spring break! You've got a hall pass! Live it up, man! It'll probably help your rap with the ladies later. 
HOG-HEAD Gary's right--when are we ever gonna get the chance to do pot brownies again? Hog-Head takes a brownie and BITES INTO IT. 
HOG-HEAD (CONT'D) Mmm. These are yummy.

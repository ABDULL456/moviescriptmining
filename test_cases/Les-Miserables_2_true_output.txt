A flash turns all the facades of the street bright crimson as though the door of a furnace has suddenly open and shut. 
A dreadful explosion bursts over the barricade. The red flag falls, the pole sliced through. Bullets richochet off the cornices of the houses, bore into the barricade and wound several men. 
ENJOLRAS (as students return fire) Comrades, do not fire back! Do not waste powder! 
In the darkness, the clang of ramrods in muskets - the troop reloading weapons. 
Enjolras picks up the fallen flag and is about to take it up when the old man Father Mabeuf who has seen many insurrections before this takes the flag and runs up onto the top of the barricade. 
ARMY OFFICER Who's there? Get down! 
MABEUF Vive la France! 
ARMY OFFICER Fire! 
A second volley. 
Father Mabeuf falls down dead. While everyone is reacting to the dead old man and the wounded, the men are distracted from noticing that some French soldiers have used the cover of darkness to creep down the street. 
All at once the FIRST FULL ATTACK begins. Shouts and the rattle of gunfire as SOLDIERS throw themselves up and over the barricade. The students run for their guns and return fire. They are taken by surprise. All could be lost in the first instant. Some soldiers make it up to the top of the barricade, where they're driven back by the fierce resistance of the defenders. Eponine sees one soldier aiming his rifle at Marius - she throws herself in front of Marius just as the rifle fires - and Marius is safe. 
They are being   overrun. Panic ensues. The gun battle is fierce. Marius   in a flash of inspiration realises all is lost unless they do   something. He drags a barrel of gunpowder to the top of the   barricade, grabs the torch and with a face of deadly resolve   he tips the torch towards the barrel. 
MARIUS Clear out or I'll blow up the barricade! 
Everyone freezes. 
ARMY OFFICER Blow it up then and take yourself with it! 
MARIUS And myself with it! 
Marius brings the torch closer to the powder keg. 
But already the soldiers have cleared out. 
Marius comes down from the barricade. 
FEUILLY (to Marius) Thank you! 
LESGLES What were you thinking! 
As everyone surrounds Marius in amazement he spots Eponine lying propped against the barricade. 
MARIUS Eponine! What have you done? 
He kneels by her side. Eponine is dying. 
EPONINE Here... It's from Cosette... I kept it from you... 
With a struggle she pulls the letter out of her pocket, and pushes it into his hand. 
EPONINE Don't be too hard on me... 
Marius is shocked to find blood pouring from her wound. 
MARIUS Eponine, you're hurt! You need some help! 
Rain begins to fall. 
EPONINE Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius - I don't feel any pain. A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt me now. You're here - that's all I need to know And you will keep me safe And you will keep me close And rain will make the flowers grow... 
MARIUS But you will live, Eponine - Dear God above! If I could close your wounds with words of love - 
EPONINE Just hold me now, and let it be. Shelter me... Comfort me... 
MARIUS You will live a hundred years If I could show you how... I won't desert you now... 
EPONINE The rain can't hurt me now... This rain will wash away what's past And you will keep me safe And you will keep me close I'll sleep in your embrace at last. 
Marius tries to comfort Eponine in his arms. 
MARIUS Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine You won't feel any pain A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt you now I'm here. 
EPONINE So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius I don't feel any pain A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt me now... 
MARIUS I will stay with you Till you are sleeping. 
EPONINE That's all I need to know And you will keep me safe (more) 
EPONINE (cont'd) And you will keep me close And rain.. Will make the flowers... Grow...

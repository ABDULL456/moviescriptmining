PRECIOUS What do you want me to say? 
MS. WEISS Whatever comes to mind when you think about your home. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Seem like inquiring white bitches always want to know. 
PRECIOUS I wish I had a TV in my room. 
MS. WEISS (beat) Is that all? 
PRECIOUS No... My muver is a like a whale person for the couch. She says I eat alla time, but then she always makin' me eat... and then call me a fat mess.... She says apartment is little because of me. 
(CONTINUED) 
58   CONTINUED:                                                58 She only leaves the house to play the number. Sometimes I feel I could just sit there wif her everyday wif the shades drawed, watch TV, eat, watch TV, eat. Can we talk about something else now? 
MS. WEISS Of course. I want to learn more about your father anyway. 
PRECIOUS I don't know much more than you do Miz White... 
MS. WEISS Weiss.

MS. WEISS Yes you did Claireece. You said your father gave you... 
PRECIOUS No I didn't neitha. If you heard that, then you heard sumthin' else cause I ain' said nuffin like it! 
Ms. Weiss' wariness looks unmoved. 
PRECIOUS Now whas next?

(CONTINUED) 
58   CONTINUED: (2)                                               58 Precious turns to Ms. Weiss. A DOORBELL RINGS ... 
59   INT. 444 LENOX AVE. APT. - DAY                               59 
TOOSIE, A WOMAN IN HER LATE 50'S RADIATING A TOUGHNESS OF PRIOR GENERATIONS, enters the apartment in a business-like manner with MONGO, A SMALL, DISTRACTED AND OBVIOUSLY HANDICAPPED CHILD. Toosie has a bag of groceries in her other arm. 
Precious watches TV beside her mother. Both appear as if they've just woken up. Mary attempts to put on her wig and make up. 
Toosie gives Mongo to Mary, whose eyes never leave the television, and then hands the groceries to Precious, who takes them directly to the kitchen as Toosie leaves without a word. 
PRECIOUS (O.S.) Mongo? 
MS. WEISS (O.S.) Excuse me? 
PRECIOUS (O.S.) Mongo? Thas short for Mongoloid. She got Down Sinder. 
MS. WEISS (O.S.) You mean she has Down Syndrome? 
PRECIOUS (O.S.) Alla dat. 
The child seems only mildly aware of what is going on. 
The DOORBELL rings again. Precious opens the door. A HISPANIC WOMAN IN HER THIRTIES with an attache case enters. 
As the woman steps inside, we see that Mary has finished tidying herself. 
Mary and the woman exchange small talk while Precious listens. Mary has never seemed so congenial. 
PRECIOUS (O.S.) My grandmuver Toosie, brangs Little Mongo over on days social worker come so it look like Mongo live wif us. Then my mama get the check 'n food stamps for me 'n Little Mongo. But it's my baby. Little Mongo is money for me, not her! 
60   INT. CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY                       60 
Precious continues speaking to Ms. Weiss from the couch. 
PRECIOUS ...Sometimes I see vampires too. They come for me sometimes and they say that I am one of them. They say, "Precious, you belong wif us." 
MS. WEISS How do you respond to them? 
PRECIOUS I say, "Check wif my muver." After that, they just look at me and go down through the floor. The family downstairs is vampires so that's where they should go. 
Ms. Weiss looks up from her clipboard and over her glasses. 
Precious reflects a moment and then looks up. 
PRECIOUS I'm going to the doctor now too. It's nice. Miz Rain, she fall out when she finded out that I ain' been to no doctor. Whole class scream 'preenatal' at me. They don't know I had my first baby on the kitchen floor wif my muver kicking me upside my head. I mean, who would believe? 
Precious snickers reminiscently a moment and then turns to Ms. Weiss. 
PRECIOUS Them the kind of thangs you mean when you say talk about whatever come into my mind? 
Ms. Weiss looks up and nods through a perplexed daze.

We hear distant chimes. 
REX Honey! ...Honey?! 
Finally, through the intercom: 
MARYLIN Rex. Get away from the door. 
REX Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this? 
MARYLIN We are. And it's winding down. 
REX But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life. 
MARYLIN Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe? 
REX Marylin? 
MARYLIN Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you. 
REX Dogs? 
From inside the house we hear the menacing sound of LARGE DOGS BARKING. 
LETTERING 
On an interior wall; it says MASSEY, MEYERSON, SLOAN & GURALNICK. 
A pull back shows that we are in a waiting room, and a receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Rex Rexroth. 
RECEPTIONIST Mr. Massey will be right with you. 
INT. MASSEY MEYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Miles addresses a group of young Attorneys at the firm. 
MILES The problem is that everyone is willing to compromise. That's the problem with the institution of marriage -- it's based on compromise. Even through its dissolution. One attorney will try to score some points, the opposition will try to impeach. The process will find an equilibrium point determined by the skill of the opposing lawyers, and then each party will walk away with their portion of the "goodies." Some say, "Life is compromise." But at Massey Myerson we believe life is struggle and the ultimate destruction of your opponent. 
The Receptionist pokes her head into the conference room. 
RECEPTIONIST Your eleven o'clock is here. 
MILES Ladies and Gentlemen -- we will continue this at the Associates Meeting next Friday. In the meantime, I want you to consider this... Ivan the Terrible, Henry the VIII, Attila the Hun -- what did they have in common? 
As he exits. 
ASSOCIATE Middle names? 
MILES MASSEY'S OFFICE 
You may have seen it in the issue before last of "World of Interiors." There's a Rothko on the wall, an Elle Bleu humidor on the desk, peonies in the vase, and the diploma is from Yale. 
MILES Mr. Rexroth. 
REX Rex, please. 
MILES Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign. 
REX Thank you. 
MILES Now Rex. 
He leans back in the leather executive chair behind his desk, makes a steeple of his fingers, and dons his look of deepest concern. 
MILES -- Tell me your troubles. 
Rex, nervous, laughs ruefully. 
REX Jeez. Where do I start? 
Miles gives an encouraging, rueful smile in return. 
REX ...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place. 
MILES That's her job. You have to respect that.

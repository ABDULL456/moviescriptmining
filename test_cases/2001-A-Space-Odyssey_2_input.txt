POOLE Yes, I thought so. 
BOWMAN Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now. 
POOLE How? 
BOWMAN Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal. 
POOLE That's true.

C12 CONINUED 
BOWMAN (sighs)  Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you? 
POOLE WALKS TO THE HAL 9000 COMPUTER 
POOLE Hal... Dave and I believe that there's something about the mission that we weren't told. Something that the rest of the crew know and that you know. We'd like to know whether this is true. 
HAL I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know. 
BOWMAN He's got a point. 
POOLE Okay, then how do we re-phrase the question?

C12 CONTINUED 
BOWMAN Still, you really don't believe it, do you? 
POOLE Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training. 
BOWMAN Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us. 
POOLE I know. It would be almost inconceivable. 
BOWMAN But not completely inconceivable? 
POOLE I suppose it isn't logically impossible. 
BOWMAN I guess it isn't. 
POOLE Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.

C12 CONTINUED 
BOWMAN Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going? 
POOLE Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false. 
HAL I will if I can, Frank. 
POOLE Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false? 
HAL True. 
POOLE Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true? 
HAL That's true.

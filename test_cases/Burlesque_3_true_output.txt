ALI Liar. She leans in and impulsively pulls him into a kiss. 
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Jack, alone now, collects the clothes Ali left behind. He reaches under the couch and sees the PHOTO of Ali and her mother. He picks it up, smooths out the cracks. Traces 7- year-old Ali's face with his fingertips. 
INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - GUEST HOUSE - DAY 
Ali lies in a tangle of 1000-thread-count sheets. Her eyes blink open. She sits up alone, getting her bearings. 
ALI Where am I? She sees a Warhol-esque PRINT OF MARCUS on the wall. She raises her brows then sees her disheveled reflection in a huge mirror: smeared mascara, hair askew. 
ALI (CONT'D) Who am I? She sees her and Marcus's clothes in a trail on the floor and bites her lip, remembering last night. 
INT. MARCUS'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Ali, freshly showered, enters, a stranger in a strange land. STAFF is milling around. She HEARS a SPLASH. Looks out the glass windows, sees Marcus swimming laps. The HOUSEKEEPER passes her, nods "morning". Ali smiles. Then she notices a long table full of miniature MODELS of BUILDINGS. She takes them in, pausing at a tall, sleek MODEL of a glass HIGH-RISE, towering over the other models. She runs her finger lightly over it, intrigued. Then she sees the address marker: 7800 Sunset Blvd. Ali stares, stunned. Marcus enters, toweling himself dry. 
MARCUS Morning. 
He comes up behind her, nuzzles her neck. 
ALI What is this? 
MARCUS Now it's a model. But when it grows up, it'll be a mixed-use space: retail and residential. 
ALI This is the address of the Burlesque Lounge. Marcus shrugs, dries his hair. 
MARCUS Best view on the Sunset Strip, with no windows. When I'm done with it, it'll have a thousand. 
ALI You can't tear down the club. 
MARCUS Actually, I can. 
ALI But what about the history? That place is a landmark. 
MARCUS Not according to the city. 
ALI Does Tess know about this? 
MARCUS What Tess knows and doesn't know isn't a big concern of mine. 
ALI What makes you think she would ever sell the Lounge? 
MARCUS She has no choice. She's going under. 
ALI But that club is her life! 
MARCUS Oh, come on, you get this. It's business. It's not personal. 
ALI Not personal? It's pretty god damn personal for Tess! And Coco and Sean and Alexis. And what about Jesse? And Dave the lighting guy? 
MARCUS 
ALI -- 
ALI And what about me? It's pretty God damn personal to me. She turns to leave. 
MARCUS Where are you going? 
ALI To the club. Where I work. She marches out of the room, resolute-- 
MARCUS Ali-- wait!!! At the door she turns back and looks at him. As he starts to speak, she SLAMS the door shut as we HEAR "THAT'S LIFE". 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Eva Destruction does a sexy contortionist number on stage as the Tattooed Bumper Band plays "THAT'S LIFE" with her. CLOSE ON - a LINE OF SHOT GLASSES. Tequila is poured. The Bartenders behind the bar, Jack sits on a stool on the other side, his bags packed beside him. They all pick up their shot glasses, toast and drink as they begin to sing "THAT'S LIFE" in a rousing, fun, guys number. 
THE BARTENDERS AND JACK 
THAT ' S LIFE, THAT ' S WHAT ALL THE 
PEOPLE SAY. 
YOU'RE RIDING HIGH IN APRIL, 
SHOT DOWN IN MAY 
BUT I KNOW I'M GONNA CHANGE THAT TUNE, 
WHEN I'M BACK ON TOP, BACK ON TOP IN JUNE. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON - CARRY MUSIC 
Tess pulls into the lot-- gets out of her car dressed to the nines in a tailored business suit, hair up, professional. She HEADS into the club-- 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - SAME

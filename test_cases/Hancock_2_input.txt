AARON my mouth. It's starting to swell. I think he loosened a tooth. Mary - maternal duty calls. 
MARY All right. Go to your room. I'll get the ice pack. Aaron exits. Mary exits. Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for the front door. Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him... 
MARY (CONT' D) You're leaving? 
HANCOCK It's getting late. 
MARY I'm sorry. 
HANCOCK I'm going to take a walk. 
MARY Really? On the boardwalk? 
HANCOCK Maybe. Pause. 
AARON (O.S.) Mom.' 
MARY I'm sorry. She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought. 
HANCOCK 
(FINALLY) Good night, Mary. 
MARY Good night. 
INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT 
The clock - 9:45 pm. The store rests in afterhour stillness. Horus paces by the side door, his ears pressed to the phone receiver - no answer. He hangs up. Checks his watch. Goes to the front entrance and peers out at the street - no Roheim. 
INT. BAR - NIGHT 
The bar. The smoke. The scums of humanity. Gina - over there, marketing her cleavage to anything with a pulse and a penis. She mingles with a BAR FLY. Her eyes locate Hancock - entering, finding a seat. From an adjacent stool, A MAN places his hand on Hancock's lap. Whispers to him. 
MAN I wear dresses. How about you? 
HANCOCK (considers; nah) Get lost. The warning comes across quite well - the man exits. Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door. 
GINA (to bar fly) Meet you outside. The El Camino, right? The bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face in her hands, studies him. 
GINA (CONT'D) Your eyes are calm. It's good. She withdraws her hands. 
HANCOCK What? 
GINA But you're still here. She rises. And as she makes for the exit... 
GINA (CONT'D) Nice haircut. Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole. He inhales the rest of his cigarette - pensive. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT 
The clock, it reads 1:05 am. Horns, his flashlight, they're making their rounds. His routine takes him outside - via an EXIT door. 
EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT 
A dark alley. Dumpsters. Boxes. Horus peruses the premises. Heads around the building and to the street.:. 
. as a ragged FIGURE collapses onto.him. It's Roheim and he's been drinking, right? 
HORUS Dear God. Horus catches him. 
INT. WATANABE'S - NIGHT 
They find a chair in the back, Horus Positioning Roheim in the light. The old man isn't drunk - his mouth agape, his face bruised with wounds from a serious pummeling. A chunk of lip dangles, bleeds. 
HORUS Jesus. Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to nurse' the wounds. 
ROHEIM Figured I can get you by the front... but you weren't there.

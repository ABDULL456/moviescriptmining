{"train": "The Man in the Iron Mask - 9/18/95 First Draft by Randall Wallace \nTHE MAN IN THE IRON MASK \nby \nRandall Wallace \nFIRST DRAFT \nSeptember 18, 1995 \nFADE IN: \nFrom the BLACKNESS before the first images, we hear a young woman's tortured SCREAM, muffled by her own will.  We see her mouth, open in agony; her face, beaded with sweat.  Her name is ANNE, and she is Queen of France.  She lies in \nA ROYAL BEDCHAMBER \nThe royal DOCTOR kneels at the foot of her bed; her own royal mother grips her hands... \nOn the opposite side of the huge bedchamber, and separated from the queen's bed by an artistically painted screen, are royal ADVISORS sweating and anxious for any word to take to their king.  They wince as the Queen moans again in the pain of childbirth. \nHer fingers claw out for help, but her Doctor ignores her need to be touched and comforted; he is concerned only for the baby.  Only her PRIEST, FATHER BELLES, sits at her head, stroking her hair gently and rapidly whispering prayers. \nDOCTOR The head is born!  One arm... the other arm... it is a boy! \nThe advisors, disregarding the Queen's privacy, scurry around the screen to see the doctor lift the beautiful baby, wet with birth.  The mother -- the Queen -- is still in agony, yet she struggles to lift her head. \nADVISOR 1 I shall tell the king! \nADVISOR 2 I shall tell him! \nThey hurry for the door.  But their race to be first to bring this great news to the King is interrupted as the Queen emits another cry; it surprises the doctor. \nDOCTOR M'lady...? \nHe kneels again to examine the Queen. \nDOCTOR Another...?  It is another! \nThe joy vanishes from the faces of the advisors.  They look gravely at each other, as they hear a second BABY'S CRY. \nSMASH TO: \nA DARK COURTYARD - NIGHT \nA door groans open in a hidden corner of the palace courtyard and into the darkness steps a dashing figure.  His face is hidden in shadow, but we know from the silhouette of his cloak and plumed hat that he is a MUSKETEER. \nHe carries an OBLONG BASKET. \nA carriage is just rattling onto the flagstones of the courtyard.  The Musketeer steps into its interior, with a sharp word to the driver -- \nMUSKETEER Away. \nThe whip CRACKS and the carriage plunges into the night. \nTIME DISSOLVE: \nEXT.  ESTABLISHING THE ISLAND FORTRESS PRISON - DAY \nOn a gash of rock thrusting upward from the sea along the southern coast of France stands an island fortress, a prison, like an Alcatraz of the Mediterranean.  Just off a coastline renowned for its beauty, the fortress is horrible and foreboding.  As we SUPERIMPOSE: \nTWENTY-TWO YEARS LATER \nINT.  THE FORTRESS PRISON \nWith the camera as our moving POV, we survey the prison.  It is a horrible place:  dungeons where prisoners lie in their own filth; corners where jailers rut with unresisting captive women; long twisting corridors lined with cells, from which prisoners whimper, or moan in madness.  Up a long winding staircase our POV moves; we push through the barred window of a cell... It is somewhat cleaner than the rest of the places we've seen, but still a prison.  We PAN the cell. \nAnd we see a man.  A MAN IN AN IRON MASK.  It is terrifying, to think of anyone imprisoned in this way.  We push in on his eyes... They are blue, childlike. \nA greasy jailer -- the prisoner's KEEPER -- puts his face to the barred window of the door, and speaks with bored cruelty. \nKEEPER You dead yet? \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK No, Keeper. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  ESTABLISHING PARIS - DAY \nSUPERIMPOSE: \nPARIS \nEXT.  PARIS STREET - NIGHT \nARAMIS Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem. \nAramis lifts d'Artagnan's cloak as evidence:  near its hem, sure enough, is the remnant of a broken egg. \nD'ARTAGNAN I see your mind is sharp as ever. The King said, \"Right away.\"  Cut deep and hard, my friends. \nPORTHOS Deep and hard, D'Artagnan. \nD'Artagnan clasps Porthos' hand, then that of Aramis, and leaves, as Porthos shakes his head. \nPORTHOS We were all Musketeers once, eh?  Oh, I forgot.  For the poor, the ones you were praying for. \nHe hands a purse to Aramis.  Surprised, even touched, Aramis reaches for it.  Just as he takes the money, Porthos throws a haymaker; but Aramis sees the sucker punch coming and ducks. Suddenly the two old warriors are circling again. \nPORTHOS I wonder how Athos is doing. \nINT.  A SMALL HOUSE - DAY \nATHOS stands at the dressing table in a modest room; dressed in a dark plain coat, he too is a former Musketeer -- gray haired and handsome, intensely intelligent, with a hard crust of manners masking seas of emotion.  He opens a small wooden box and digs through medals of heroism; he finds what he's looking for just as his son RAOUL enters.  RAOUL is in his mid-twenties; he wears the uniform of a soldier in the French Army.  He is nervous, pacing, looking at every angle in the mirror. \nRAOUL Do I look all right? \nATHOS None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you. \nRAOUL I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused... \nATHOS Perhaps this will help. \nHe hands Raoul the simple gold ring he took from the box. \nRAOUL Mother's ring.  I can't take this. \nATHOS She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves. \nThey embrace.  Athos' eyes mist, but he smiles. \nATHOS Now go, and bring back your fiance. \nESTABLISHING - THE ROYAL PALACE - DAY \nThe Palace glows golden in the Parisian sunshine.  Carriages deposit guests for the lavish party in the royal gardens. \nEXT.  THE ROYAL PALACE - GARDENS - DAY \nAttractive young adults strut about in the extravagant attire of Louis XIV's France, the men like peacocks, the ladies in gowns that seem to squeeze their entire bodies up into their bosoms.  They laugh and smile and strike courtly poses pretending to talk with each other -- but all eyes are on the doorway, through which the king is about to come... \nJUST BEYOND THAT PALACE DOORWAY \nKING LOUIS the Fourteenth is having his wardrobe adjusted by a flock of tailors.  He is twenty-two, and would be quite handsome, except for the total self-absorption.  He's checking himself in a full length golden mirror as two of his advisors, PIERRE and CLAUDE, try to speak with him. \nPIERRE Your Majesty, I know it is a... a festive time, but before -- \nKING LOUIS The blue sash.  No, the burgundy! \nPIERRE ... before the party begins -- \nKING LOUIS The party has already begun -- so why are you delaying me? \nPIERRE We do not wish to delay you, Majesty, but... as your advisors, we feel it is our -- our -- \nCLAUDE ... our duty. \nPIERRE Yes!  It is our duty to let you know... there are riots in Paris. \nLOUIS Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment? \nPIERRE Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving. \nLOUIS Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it? \nAs he says this, a replica of the Matterhorn made of fruits and meringues is carried past the window by a team of chefs. \nPIERRE Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before -- \nLOUIS Aramis!  I have been expecting you! (to the tailors) We are satisfied, that will do. \nThe tailors and advisors withdraw as Aramis -- still in his simple priest's robe -- strides forward and bows to the kind. \nARAMIS Your birthday celebration, your Majesty? \nLOUIS Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits. \nARAMIS Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty. \nLOUIS I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself. \nRAOUL AND MICHELLE \nMichelle is amazed at this. \nMICHELLE I have never seen a diamond so large! \nIt almost makes Raoul ashamed of the modest ring hidden in his hand. \nLOUIS Into the maze!  All of you! Disperse, I command you! \nThe dwarf releases the pig, poking him through a tiny break in the hedge; the critter skitters as only a pig can, eluding the first laughing lunges of the guests. \nTHE PIG CHASE is a merry melee, as the maze becomes a tangle of confusion.  LOUIS climbs to a platform above the top of the ten foot hedge that forms the maze.  From his perch he looks down on all the action, and calls encouragement. \nLOUIS Are you men or mice?! \nMICHELLE squeals as the pig scurries by and Raoul dives for it.  He almost has the pig... then it kicks free. \nRAOUL The pendant will be yours! \nWith that he races after the pig. \nMICHELLE tries to follow, this way, that way, through the maze.  Then she stops, face to face with the King, entering through a gate hidden in one of the maze's dead corners. \nLOUIS Michelle, isn't it? \nSpeechless, she nods. \nLOUIS I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful. \nMICHELLE Sire, I -- \nLOUIS You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King? \nHer eyes go still; she understands what is happening. \nFROM BEHIND THE GATE, we see d'Artagnan, watching as Louis tries to seduce the young woman.  Even as d'Artagnan watches, the pig comes rooting through the hedge; with a deft movement d'Artagnan catches the animal's leg and lifts it with the sureness of the farm boy he once was.  The pig is quiet and comfortable in d'Artagnan's hands. \nD'Artagnan watches as the King approaches Michelle, and she allows him to touch her cheek.  The king leans to kiss her... Michelle does not move... \nWHHEEEKKKK!  The pig sails over the gate and hits the ground running, right at Louis' feet; it sets him dancing. \nThe spell of the king's royal attention is shattered; as the pig scrambles away, Michelle backs away. \nLOUIS Wait!  Michelle, I -- \nToo late, he sees the shadow of the man looming above him, leaping down onto him from the observation platform.  It is the servant who offered the tray to Raoul and Michelle; he has armed himself with a knife from the carving table, and is diving now to plunge the blade into the king's throat. \nThe king is helpless, frozen.  The assassin leaps, falling toward the king... and is impaled on the sword of d'Artagnan, springing through the gate to save his king. \nMichelle screams, the king gasps, and the assassin drops, mortally wounded.  They stare down at him now; the would-be assassin gurgles words through his agony... \nASSASSIN Feed... your... people. \nParty guests, having heard Michelle scream, are running in to find them.  Michelle rushes off, to find Raoul; several people are coming up. \nASSASSIN Your people starve...!  Feed -- \nThe king snatches out his own dagger and imperiously cuts the throat of the dying man, to stop these offensive words.  The king looks at his stunned subjects. \nLOUIS A pitiful madman, nothing more. Come, let us continue our chase! Where is our unicorn? \nThe King prances away.  It takes the guests a moment, but they know that only gaiety will please their King, and off they go again, laughing as if nothing happened. \nD'Artagnan stands still as the young Musketeers under his command come rushing up with swords drawn. \nYOUNG MUSKETEER Captain! \nSeeing the dead assassin, their eyes fill with admiration. \nYOUNG MUSKETEER You are the best -- \nD'Artagnan can't even listen; with a last glance at the King he turns quickly and walks away. \nINT.  FORTRESS PRISON \nThe Man in the Iron Mask sits on the floor.  A key rattles in the lock and his keeper shuffles in, carrying food. \nKEEPER Food, moron. \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK Thank you, Keeper. \nNot watching what he's doing, the bulbous keeper trips on something and stumbles, dropping the food.  The prisoner jumps to his feet, concerned. \nKEEPER Look what you've done! \nD'ARTAGNAN Stop you?  You are Frenchmen, are you not?  I am one of you. \nRUFFIAN The King is a Frenchman, but he is not one of us! \nD'ARTAGNAN Citizens of Paris!  Give ear to me! \nRUFFIAN We'll give you their ears! \nWith that he draws a dagger from his filthy shirt and puts it to the ear of the young Lieutenant who is already bloody from being dragged through the street. \nD'ARTAGNAN Wait -- and listen!  I beg you! \nRIOTER They give us garbage, not fit for rats!  They think we are garbage! \nWith that one of the rioters hurls a moldy beet at d'Artagnan, who draws his sword in a slick liquid movement, he cuts the vegetable from the air. \nThe display of expertise is startling.  Someone else throws a head of lettuce; d'Artagnan slices it in half, and as the pieces fly he skewers one with the point of his sword. \nD'ARTAGNAN I'm on my way to a salad!  Doesn't anybody have any endive? \nThe mob laughs at this panache, and the amazing display of swordsmanship that lies behind it.  Someone tosses more lettuce, and d'Artagnan divides and skewers this one as well. This time the crowd applauds. \nD'ARTAGNAN A tomato? \nCan he do it?  Someone fires a tomato right at his head, and sure enough d'Artagnan spears it.  Then, with a victorious flourish, he takes a bite of it.  His face contorts with the taste, and he spits the pieces out; the crowd is hushed. \nD'ARTAGNAN You are right.  It is rotten.  I will speak to the King myself.  You have my word. \nThe mob is completely won over by d'Artagnan; the ruffian, angry that his riot is fizzling, raises his knife again over the soldiers, but now the point of d'Artagnan's sword flicks to the ruffian's neck. \nD'ARTAGNAN And you will release those men -- for they serve France... and you. \nRIOTERS Three cheers for d'Artagnan! Hurrah...!!  Hurrah...!! \nThe soldiers who moments before were about to be ripped apart now stand and look at d'Artagnan in gratitude and awe.  The mob has forgotten them; they see only d'Artagnan as he rakes his blade clean, returns it to its scabbard, reins his horse around, and slowly rides away, escorting the soldiers back toward the palace. \nINT.  PALACE - NIGHT \nD'Artagnan strides into the long hallway leading to the royal apartments.  As he reaches the door to the king's rooms, he finds a knot of royal advisors -- among them Pierre and Claude -- gathered outside the king's door. \nCLAUDE We already know about the riots! \nD'ARTAGNAN Does he know? \nPIERRE We will tell him, when it is... \nCLAUDE Convenient. \nBlocked by the advisors, d'Artagnan leaves them, turning down one hallway, and then another; he reaches the Hall of Mirrors and touches the golden frame of one mirror at its corner; the mirror becomes a door, revealing a secret passage within the walls.  D'Artagnan steps through and the portal closes again, leaving no trace of its existence. \nINT.  PALACE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWithin a bed whose tapestried posts stretch to the sixteen foot ceiling, the king is making love; the YOUNG WOMAN lying beneath him is doing her best to sound sincere. \nYOUNG WOMAN Oh yes!  So good!  Ooo, wonderful, Marvelous!  Fan-tas -- \nLouis climaxes with a grunt.  She tries to sound pleased. \nYOUNG WOMAN Oh, Louis, that was incredible.  It was better than ever before.  It -- \nLOUIS I'm hungry. \nHe hops up, throwing on a silk robe embroidered in gold. \nYOUNG WOMAN I will have food brought. \nLOUIS I like to eat alone. \nHe moves to what appears to be a wardrobe, standing against the far wall, and opens its door, revealing a secret staircase hidden within the thick walls of the palace. \nLOUIS By the way, you'll be moving tomorrow. \nLeaving the girl without another word, he moves down the concealed stairs. \nINT.  THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT \nLouis reaches the bottom of the stairs, disguised behind a similar wardrobe in his own bedroom.  He steps out -- and is startled as the lifesize portrait of Louis XIII on the other side of the room opens to admit d'Artagnan. \nLOUIS Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death! \nD'ARTAGNAN It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor. \nLOUIS I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow. \nD'ARTAGNAN Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature. \nARAMIS I grow closer to my target, your Majesty. \nLOUIS You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own. \nThe King moves away, followed by his fawning advisors. \nINT.  THE FAVORITE MISTRESS' PALACE ROOMS - DAY \nA young Musketeer ushers Michelle into the palace bedroom previously occupied by the King's last mistress.  The Musketeer leaves her alone, frozen in the center of the room, awed by the opulence.  Her eyes play over the details: \n-- The handcarved, richly upholstered furniture, beneath her fingertips... \n-- The carved figures of cherubic angels, gleaming with gold, upon the posts of the bed... \n-- The murals on the walls and ceiling... \nHer reverie is interrupted by a HANDMAIDEN who bustles in carrying a magnificent dress. \nHANDMAIDEN After your bath put on this, it is the King's favorite color.  That letter on the desk came here for you this morning. \nShe tosses the dress onto the bed and is gone.  Left alone, Michelle lifts the letter, and recognizes the writing. \nMICHELLE Raoul! \nShe opens the letter and reads quickly. \nMICHELLE The army!  Oh Raoul, don't despair! I will always be faithful... \nShe interrupts herself as her eyes fall on the gorgeous dress.  She looks around at the sumptuous palace apartment, and gazes again at the murals painted above the bed. \nThey depict naked gods and goddesses, in Olympian orgies. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE - STEAMING WATER, POURED INTO A TUB \nThe Handmaiden has prepared a 17th Century bathtub for Michelle, and now retires. \nHANDMAIDEN If you need me further, just ring. \nAs the handmaiden leaves, exiting frame, we PUSH IN on one of the murals on the wall.  The eye of one of the figures there is no longer the painted eye it was before, but is a real human eye, disguised by the mural... \nTHE KING, IN THE SECRET PASSAGEWAY \nis spying on Michelle. \nTHE KING'S POV \nas Michelle undresses and steps into the bath.  Louis catches tantalizing glimpses of her richly sensual body in the soapy water, and it stokes his desire. \nINT.  PALACE - MICHELLE'S NEW ROOM - DAY \nMichelle stands before the mirror, staring at herself, breaktakingly gorgeous in her new dress.  She stares for a long time, surprised at her own beauty. \nShe reaches to a vase of roses and pulls one out, blotting it around her neck, perfuming herself with its fragrance.  She looks into the mirror, at her eyes... In guilt for what she is already feeling, she lifts Raoul's letter to read it again.  Then she gasps -- the King stands right before her. \nMICHELLE Sire!  I -- How did you -- \nLOUIS How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that? \nMICHELLE ... Nothing. \nLOUIS A letter.  May I see? \nHe takes the letter; she has no resistance against him.  The King reads, his eyes hardening suddenly; but then he smiles. \nLOUIS From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king. \nMICHELLE Raoul... is in love... \nLOUIS Enough of this, our dinner waits. \nTossing the letter aside, he offers her his arm.  She takes it and allows him to escort her from the room. \nINT.  PALACE - THE HALL OF MIRRORS \nThe hall is alive with glorious light, fiery gold frames surrounding silvery mirrors blazing with reflections. Musicians line the length of the hall, and when Louis and Michelle appear at the far doorway they begin playing for the couple as they parade past.  Michelle is speechless, as Louis smiles at her awed innocence. \nINT.  ROYAL DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nLouis leads Michelle into a towering room surrounding a magnificent table, decked out with candelabra and sumptuous delicacies -- set for just two. \nTHE DINNER \nLouis and Michelle sit opposite each other, attended by a dozen servants.  Michelle stares at her plate. \nHEAD GUARD Who is this, then? \nThe little priest remains in the boat, slumped over.  One GUARD speaks to the little priest in Italian, and the little priest seems barely able to left his head; Aramis answers for him, in Italian, and the guard translates -- \nGUARD He says he's the replacement. \nAramis rattles off more Italian. \nGUARD He says it is only one day a month when the prisoner gets confession, and the little one is too sick to move.  The big one doesn't speak French either. \nHEAD GUARD Then let's get it done. \nThe head guard gestures to let them pass. \nINT.  CELL OF THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK \nThe prisoner has used the torn Bible to make all sorts of amazing origami, invented from his own head.  He looks up as he hears the door open, and sees Aramis, the priest. \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK My confession day!  But where is the other one? \nAramis says something in Latin -- the first words of the ceremony of absolution -- as the guards lock the door behind him and move off down the corridor. \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK I know you don't speak my language -- but is the other one all right? Please tell me he is not dead too, or I will have lost everyone. \nAramis goes on mumbling Latin mechanically, for the sake of the retreating guards.  The Man in the Iron Mask is desperate for someone to talk to. \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK I... tore my Bible.  Or someone else did.  But it was all right.  \"Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in Thy sight, Oh Lord our God and My Redeemer.\" \nAramis has stopped talking, and stares transfixed at this sight of the prisoner, in the iron mask. \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK I'm sorry.  You're never seen me before.  I must frighten you. \nAramis puts his finger to his lips. \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK What are you doing?  Why do you -- \nAramis clamps his hand over the mouth hole, and whispers -- \nARAMIS I am a friend, here to help you. \nAramis hurriedly removes his robes, revealing the bundle. \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK What -- ? \nARAMIS It is an escape.  To freedom. \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK Freedom...? \nHe says it as if the concept is beyond him.  Aramis undoes the bundle, revealing the limp body. \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK Wh-- ?  He is dead!  Who is he? \nARAMIS He is you. \nAramis uncovers the head of the body.  It is covered in a mask, identical to the prisoner's. \nINT.  PRISON CORRIDOR - CELL \nThe Guards are sharing a bottle of wine, when they hear -- \nARAMIS Hey!  Hey! \nGUARD What now? \nINT.  CELL \nThe guards enter to find the Man in the Iron Mask slumped on the floor.  Aramis, looking like the fat priest again, stands over him spouting Italian, as one GUARD translates -- \nGUARD He says he just fell stone dead as he was reading him the Mass. \nHEAD GUARD I never thought the bugger would last this long.  But how could he just keel over and -- \nAramis rattles off more Italian, and suddenly the guard who understands it stops examining the body and backs off. \nGUARD He says the prisoner has the fever, just like the little priest does. \nHEAD GUARD Plague?  They brought plague in here?  Get him out of here.  Now! \nAramis rattles off a protest in Italian. \nGUARD No, no last rites!  Get away! \nEXT.  PRISON - DAY \nAramis climbs into the boat; as he sits down his belly stirs, but the guards don't see it -- they are using poles to push the boat away, into the sea. \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK This way. \nThe prisoner manipulates the cup in the way he must to get a drink, then falls back to the pillow. \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison. \nATHOS Who came? \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, \"What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?\"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting. \nATHOS And you never knew why? \nPRISONER I thought... there is something about my face that men do not want to see.  Something that makes them cruel.  But then I realized they were cruel even when I was wearing the mask.  I knew there must be some other reason, but I could not think what it was. \nATHOS What is your name? \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK The old man and woman called me... Phillippe. \nATHOS Phillippe.  Rest now. \nAthos moves to the door. \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK Thank you... for your kindness. \nAthos nods, pauses a moment... and leaves. \nINT.  A DARK APARTMENT IN PARIS - NIGHT \nThe lock rattles, and the door swings open.  D'Artagnan enters, lifting a lantern to throw light on the dark room. It is Athos' apartment, the one he visited earlier; now he finds it empty, devoid of clues.  He stands there alone. \nHe turns to leave, then glimpses a familiar painting hanging beside the door.  Lifting his light he studies the portrait: Athos, Aramis, Porthos and himself -- four Musketeers, beat friends, in their prime.  Together then, inseparable. \nD'ARTAGNAN My friends... Where have you gone? \nHe lowers the lantern, and leaves. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MESSAGE FROM THE PRISON... \nhas reached the court.  Gloved hands pass the message from one advisor to another, and finally to the King. \nINT.  PALACE - KING'S STUDY - DAY \nThe King reads the message, rerolls it, thinks a moment, and hands the scroll to Claude. \nLOUIS Take this to my mother. \nTHE MESSAGE \nis again passed, this time into the hands of the Queen Mother's eldest nun-attendant, and then into the hands of the Queen Mother herself.  The Queen is in her private rooms, and for the first time we see her with her hair down.  She accepts the scroll, opens it, and reads. \nHer eyes fill with pain, grief, guilt... emotions she hides, turning away. \nNUN M'lady... are you...? \nANNE Please, just... go away. \nINT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nD'Artagnan returns from his ride to Athos' place.  He looks down at the Queen's door.  He checks the clock on the wall; it is a few minutes past nine.  He enters his room, moves to the window, and waits there, to catch a glimpse of her. \nINT.  COUNTRY MANOR HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT \nAramis is digging into a hearty meal, while Porthos only stares at his plate. \nARAMIS See?  There is plenty of food in the country.  But the King keeps it going to the army instead of -- \nAthos marches in, all business. \nATHOS He is sleeping.  Now see here, Aramis, it's time you told us -- \nHe breaks off as a voluptuous serving girl leans over to spoon food onto Porthos' plate; her breasts jiggle below his nose, and she gives him a smile. \nPORTHOS I have no appetite for food, I am wasting away.  Say goodbye to Porthos, for he is gone.  Even women don't interest me now. \nThe girl moves to whisper with two other serving girls, who seem fascinated with the roguish Porthos; their giggles and winks make Porthos even more morose; he tells his friends... \nPORTHOS I tell you a secret.  I sleep with three women at once, not because my appetite is so great, but because now it take three to excite me. \nPorthos heaves himself to his feet and shuffles off; Aramis sighs, having heard all this before.  Athos sits down. \nATHOS Who is he, Aramis? \nARAMIS Tomorrow. \nINT.  PALACE CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThey reach the Queen Mother's room; d'Artagnan reaches to open the door for her, and she keeps her eyes lowered.  But before he can let her go, he must whisper... \nD'ARTAGNAN Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart. \nANNE Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan. \nWith those whispered words hanging in the air, she enters her room.  And d'Artagnan moves alone, back to his. \nINT.  MICHELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe King is trying to make love with Michelle -- but she isn't responding.  He stops, exasperated. \nLOUIS What is wrong? \nShe says nothing.  He tries kissing her again. \nLOUIS What is wrong?! \nShe begins weeping uncontrollably, and turns from him. \nMICHELLE Raoul... Oh, Raoul... \nLOUIS Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but -- \nMICHELLE We'll burn in hell.  Both of us. \nThe King stands; he's had enough of this. \nLOUIS No, my love.  You will burn in hell, for your sins.  But I will not -- for I am King.  My position is ordained by God. \nHe snatches the gold coverlet from her bed to cover his naked body and stalks to his stairway; the embroidered coverlet trails behind him like a regal train in a royal procession. Leaving her weeping, he moves down into... \nINT.  THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT \nThe King angrily stalks around his bedroom, too agitated to sleep.  He grabs food from the table by the window, and starts to pop a grape into his mouth when he stops.  He sees something out the window; it stops him dead cold. \nIt is a man, standing in the gardens, wearing an iron mask. \nLOUIS D'Artagnan!  Guards! \nEXT.  GARDENS - OUTSIDE THE KING'S WINDOW - NIGHT \nThe apparition ducks into the shadows. \nINT.  PALACE - D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nD'Artagnan is sitting on his cot thinking of all that has just happened when he hears the king's shouts of alarm. \nLOUIS' VOICE Help! \nIn an instant d'Artagnan is reacting, snatching up his sword and racing out into the corridor, toward the King's room. \nINT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThe guards outside the King's room find the door latched from within, and they don't know what to do... D'Artagnan, running up, never slows down; he crashes into the doors. \nINT.  THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT \nThe King whirls as the doors explode inward and d'Artagnan barrels through. \nLOUIS Out there!  Look!  Out there!  He -- \nThe garden is empty. \nD'ARTAGNAN I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see? \nLOUIS It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I -- \nD'Artagnan guides his guards out, but glances back to see the King, ashamed and worried.  D'Artagnan tells his men -- \nD'ARTAGNAN Check the garden. \nEXT.  GARDEN - OUTSIDE THE KING'S WINDOW - NIGHT \nAn old Jesuit priest slips back into the garden chapel where the nuns have returned to pray.  He kneels at a back pew, tucking the iron mask deep within his robes.  The young Musketeers who move through the garden glance into the chapel, see only the normal piety, and move on.  The old priest crosses himself, bows his head, and smiles. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE - PHILLIPPE'S EYES, THROUGH THE SLITS OF THE MASK \nThey are frightened.  As we PULL BACK we see the Iron Mask, in an OVERHEAD POV... Phillippe is lying on his back, his head resting on an anvil.  Athos stands close by, lending support; Aramis and Porthos look on.  A blacksmith stands over Phillippe.  He positions the point of his chisel against the lock of the mask.  It takes several ringing hammer blows -- which we experience from a POV WITHIN THE MASK -- before the lock breaks. \nAthos, as gently as he can, pries open the iron mask. \nARAMIS I have it all worked out. \nATHOS Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner -- \nARAMIS Those can be adopted -- \nATHOS And people close to him, who -- \nARAMIS Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant! \nATHOS It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well! \nARAMIS Yes, and he has a choice! \nAramis stops thundering at Athos, and turns to Phillippe. \nARAMIS What about it, Phillippe?!  All that time in prison, all that time you suffered, was it for nothing?!  You memorized the entire Bible, or so your priest told me!  An act of survival, of defiance, of courage! Your years within the mask have given you reserves of strength that others could not imagine.  Your home was a dungeon and now you may be a king, if you have the heart to make it so!  Do you have the heart? \nPhillippe stands shakily, and faces them. \nPHILLIPPE I will try. \nPhillippe walks -- nearly wanders -- from the room. \nARAMIS You see?  A king. \nAthos, with a glare at Aramis, follows Phillippe. \nEXT.  MANOR HOUSE GARDENS - DAY \nThe gardens are sun drenched, bursting with the beauty of a French summer.  Athos finds Phillippe there, sitting alone. \nATHOS Recent hours have been a shock. \nPHILLIPPE Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king... \nATHOS Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it. \nPHILLIPPE There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother? \nATHOS The desire for vengeance... can be a poison. \nPHILLIPPE What is its antidote? \nATHOS I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it. \nPhillippe reaches to a flower, plucks it, and smells it.  He looks around at the beauty of the garden, taking it all in. Athos looks around too; then Athos realizes Phillippe is no longer looking at the garden, but at him. \nPHILLIPPE You look so sad.  Is it something I have done? \nATHOS It is something I have done -- or did not do. \nPHILLIPPE What is that? \nATHOS I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with. \nBefore Phillippe can pursue this, Athos turns businesslike. \nATHOS We have much to do, we'd best get started.  Now suppose you were to walk into a garden, as a king... \nINT.  MANOR HOUSE DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nAramis is having dinner; he calls toward the kitchen. \nARAMIS More wine! \nAthos enters and sags into a chair, his energy spent. \nARAMIS How is he? \nATHOS Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis -- \nARAMIS (calling out) More wine!! \nATHOS You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he -- \nARAMIS You can do it. \nATHOS In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to -- \nARAMIS Three days. \nATHOS Three days??!! \nARAMIS The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...? \nARAMIS I sawed the main beam in half. \nIN THE BARN \nThe chain reaction has just begun.  The broken floorboards buckle, and the barn's walls, deprived of their central support, fall in on each other. \nIN THE FRONT ROOM \nAthos and Aramis watch wide-eyed as the whole barn completely collapses around the unfortunate Porthos.  Athos gives Aramis a look. \nARAMIS I'm a genius -- not an engineer! \nThey jump up and run out.  The commotion draws others too -- especially the three wenches Porthos had been trying to bed. \nTHE COLLAPSED BARN \nIt's a tangle of debris -- and from the size and weight of the pile, it looks as if no one could live through the collapse.  For a moment the whole pile lies silent; then suddenly it bursts apart and Porthos emerges, exploding with anger. \nPORTHOS Aramis!!  You did this, didn't you! You knew I would try hanging myself, and you sawed the beam!  Admit it! Admit it, by God!!  ADMIT IT!!! \nPorthos' eyes are bulging; he's terrifying in his fury.  And he holds one of the broken barn's timbers like a giant club, ready to bash in Aramis' brains.  Aramis is totally casual. \nARAMIS Well of course I knew it, Porthos. \nPorthos stands there, blinking. \nARAMIS You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest. \nPORTHOS Well... Well... Okay. \nPorthos starts back toward the house.  Then one of the serving girls, heading back inside, sees in one of the upper windows -- the face in the Iron Mask.  She SCREAMS -- \nWENCH AAAAAAHHHHHHH! \nPhillippe shies back from the window now, but it's too late, everyone has seen him.  Aramis, with cold intellectual curiosity, quietly observes the women's reaction, even as his hooded helpers scurry from the shadows to calm the frightened locals. \nATHOS Poor Phillippe! \nARAMIS The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice? \nATHOS All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal. \nAthos hurries in; Aramis looks at Porthos. \nARAMIS See, Porthos -- secrets are hard to keep.  We don't have much time. \nINT.  PHILLIPPE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAthos enters to find Phillippe in a corner of the bedroom, slumped and ashamed in the darkness, holding the mask. \nPHILLIPPE I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it. \nATHOS I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either. \nAthos settles into a chair, as Phillippe lays the mask aside on the table and closes his eyes.  Athos looks toward the flames of the fireplace, and in their dancing shadows he sees the face of Raoul.  Phillippe's voice interrupts -- \nPHILLIPPE Athos...?  Thank you for being my guide... back into the world. \nAthos had not thought of it that way.  Phillippe closes his eyes again, and falls asleep. \nINT.  PHILLIPPE'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nLight falls on Athos' face; it is dawn.  He hears the whinny of horses, and looks out the window to see a carriage about to leave.  Reacting quickly, he hurries out quietly. \nEXT.  CHATEAU - MORNING \nAramis and Porthos are already loaded into the carriage, as Athos runs up. \nATHOS Where are you going?! \nARAMIS Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready. \nATHOS But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but -- \nARAMIS He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days. \nATHOS What you're asking is impossible! \nARAMIS I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King. \nATHOS But -- \nARAMIS You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it. \nAramis motions to the driver, who snaps the reins and drives the horses away. \nThe man with a sword steps forward to hack Porthos down, but Porthos spins, slapping the pistol, making it BOOM but miss; he kicks the swordsman in the groin, then smashes his head against the alley wall; he backhands the gunman.  The robber with the knife tries to run; Porthos snatches a barrel from the street and hurls it into the fleeing robber's back; he falls in a heap. \nPorthos' fury has just begun.  He picks the fallen gunman up by the throat, slams him stomach down across a broken alley cart, and with one sweep of his mighty hand Porthos snatches down the man's pants. \nPORTHOS Old?!  I'll show you old!! \nPorthos snatches the pistol from the cobblestones.  We see the shock and terror on the robber's face as he feels something shocking happen behind him. \nPORTHOS Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there! \nARAMIS Come on... \nAramis, acting as if nothing happened, leads Porthos away. \nPORTHOS I have to tell you something.  I love Paris! \nAramis has found what he's looking for:  a filthy brothel. \nARAMIS Here we are. \nAramis leads Porthos inside. \nINT.  BROTHEL - NIGHT \nSleazy whores lounge around, women at the very bottom of life.  They stir and try to look more appealing as the two well dressed gentlemen enter. \nPORTHOS Aramis... These are... these are whores! \nARAMIS So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her. \nPORTHOS Did she have tits like that? \nA greasy, disgusting PIMP shuffles over. \nPIMP What do you want?  White?  Black? Both? \nARAMIS No.  We want you, Father Belles. \nThe pimp reacts with fury, drawing a pistol. \nPIMP Get out!  Now!  I will kill you where you stand! \nAramis slowly falls to his knees, before the pimp. \nARAMIS Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. \nThe pimp -- the former Father Belles, the same man we saw as the priest who prayed with the Queen at the royal birth in the opening -- shoves his pistol at Aramis' face. \nPIMP Don't!  Get out! \nARAMIS I have sinned.  And no other priest's assurance of forgiveness can mean as much as yours.  Tell me that I can be forgiven, no matter what I have done. \nAramis' eyes are hypnotic, staring deep into the fallen priest's soul.  Porthos is bug-eyed, certain Aramis' head is about to be blown apart. \nPORTHOS He's going to kill you, Aramis. \nARAMIS Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong. \nHe stares at the pimp.  The pimp's finger trembles on the trigger. \nARAMIS I have come to help you make it right.  I have come to take you home. \nThe pimp shakes convulsively; he drops to his knees, bows his head, and weeps. \nEXT.  STREETS OF PARIS - NIGHT \nAramis' carriage rattles through the dark streets; we play these secret movement sequences with an ominous, Jack-the- Ripper quality.  The carriage pulls into... \nINT.  CATHEDRAL COURTYARD - NIGHT \nThe priests scurry out to meet it.  First Aramis emerges, then Porthos -- but the appearance of the pimp surprises the cathedral priests.  They cross themselves. \nPRIESTS Father Belles! \nCrossing themselves, they embrace the prodigal priest; one MONK kneels before Aramis. \nMONK You have made a miracle! \nARAMIS God makes miracles.  You make dinner. \nAs Aramis strides toward the dining room, a Jesuit hurries up to him. \nJESUIT The ball has been rescheduled -- for tomorrow. \nAs Aramis hears this in surprise -- \nHe looks up to see that Michelle has entered through the open door behind him. \nLOUIS Never mind, it seems we have already told her. \nBut Michelle's appearance brings him up short.  It is not the cruel brush-off; she is already harshly different:  her eyes are red from crying, her lips are tight in anger. \nMICHELLE Murderer!  Murderer! \nShe holds a letter, crushed in her hand. \nMICHELLE I wrote Fromberge!  Under your seal! I wrote as you, demanding to know why he disregarded my order to keep Raoul from danger!  He writes back: \"But your Majesty!  Your last letter ordered me to put him in front of the cannon!\" \nShe hurls the crumpled letter into his face.  Everyone is frozen, silent.  She staggers toward Louis as if to attack him, then falls to her knees, weeping.  No one helps her... \nExcept d'Artagnan.  He kneels, hugs her shoulders, helps her to her feet, and guides her toward her room.  But d'Artagnan looks back once, toward Louis. \nLOUIS Hysterical woman. \nCLAUDE Sire, misuse of the royal seal -- ! \nLOUIS She'll be gone tomorrow. \nAs d'Artagnan and Michelle move out, they pass Anne, coming in.  Anne and d'Artagnan exchange a look; he remembers to give her a respectful nod, but she moves past, into the King's dressing room.  Louis is surprised. \nLOUIS Mother -- ? \nANNE May I speak with you?  Alone? \nLOUIS I am preparing for a ball! \nANNE We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy. \nExasperated, Louis waves his attendants away. \nLOUIS What is it, mother? \nANNE I wish to discuss your brother. \nLOUIS He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss. \nANNE First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner. \nLOUIS I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you. \nANNE He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him. \nLOUIS Why would you ask now?  You never asked before! \nANNE Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man. \nLOUIS You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak. \nAvoiding her stare, Louis lifts a plaster bust of his father, its eyes like the sightless pupils of Greek gods. \nANNE I believe in dreams, Louis.  They are our souls speaking to us, from that world beyond our eyes.  And that son I never saw in daylight was standing in the moonlight of my dreams.  And he wore an iron mask. \nWe see her from a low angle, from a POV behind Louis -- and we see the plaster bust burst upon the marble floor. \nLOUIS It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead! \nANNE Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream. \nAnd the night of Louis' \"dream.\"  Anne begins to walk out. \nLOUIS If... if he was wearing an iron mask in your dream, then how could you know he was your son? \nLouis smiles; he thinks he has her. \nANNE Then you did do it, Louis.  You did put your brother in an iron mask. \nAll the blood is gone from Louis' face.  Anne walks from the room, past Louis' waiting tailors.  He snaps at them. \nLOUIS I have a ball to attend! \nThey rush in.  As they scurry about, dressing him in gold, Louis' composure returns; he stares at himself in the golden mirror, likes what he sees... and smiles. \nEXT.  ROAD - NIGHT \nAramis' carriage pulls off the road and into the trees.  The Musketeers and Phillippe pile out, to find another much grander carriage there waiting.  Aramis ushers them into it. \nPHILLIPPE Whose carriage is this? \nPORTHOS It was mine.  But since you are about to be the king, it is yours. \nThe new carriage lurches away. \nPorthos waddles down stairs, and meets Aramis. \nARAMIS Quick, to the passages. \nThey hurry in the same direction Athos and Phillippe went. \nINT.  PALACE HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE KING'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nD'Artagnan catches up to the King as he is entering the door of his royal apartment. \nD'ARTAGNAN Your Majesty, is there anything -- ? \nThe King shuts the door in d'Artagnan's face. \nINT.  THE KING'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe King falls upon his bed, pressing his hands to his head. \nINT.  PALACE CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThe three Musketeers and Phillippe move quietly up a stairway and to the door of a room.  Phillippe whispers... \nPHILLIPPE The room of the King's favorite mistress? \nATHOS She will be at the ball. \nINT.  MICHELLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe door opens and they move in; it is in fact empty, though a mess.  They move to the wall, where Aramis, after a little looking, locates the levers to open the wall/door to the King's secret passageway.  Aramis enters first, the others follow.  We half expect Michelle to pop up at any moment, but the Musketeers enter the passage without incident. \nINT.  SECRET PASSAGES - NIGHT \nAramis silently leads the others through the secret passage, to the portal into the King's bedroom. \nINT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT \nThe King is lying on the bed; we see him from the POV of someone approaching him slowly, silently.  When his eyes open in panic, it is too late... We see Aramis, Athos, Porthos from the KING'S POV as they swarm him. \nARAMIS It is Judgment Day. \nHis fist drops into frame... Louis loses consciousness. \nLOUIS' POV \nas consciousness returns.  He see Phillippe in Louis' clothes.  Aramis, Athos and Porthos bow and say... \nMUSKETEERS Your Majesty. \nLOUIS, still on his bed, now wears Phillippe's clothes. \nLOUIS Wh-- Wha-- \nARAMIS Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison. \nLOUIS Phillippe?!  Why do you call me -- \nNow Louis understands everything.  He tries to struggle, but instantly Porthos shoves a rag into his mouth. \nAramis opens the main door a crack, and sees d'Artagnan has entered his room down the corridor, through whose open door he can guard the approaches to the King's rooms.  Aramis shuts the door again and turns to the others. \nARAMIS D'Artagnan guards the hallway!  You must go back the way we came! \nAthos puts his hands on Phillippe's shoulders. \nATHOS Now, your Majesty.  It is time. \nAramis and Porthos bow again to Phillippe -- now dressed and looking exactly like the King.  Phillippe's mouth is dry; he swallows hard, and follows Athos up the hidden stairs. \nINT.  MICHELLE'S BEDCHAMBER \nAthos and Phillippe move to the door; they stop there, and Athos adjusts Phillippe's costume one more time. \nATHOS You know the way. \nPhillippe nods, tremendously nervous. \nATHOS You have your note? \nPhillippe pats his pocket, like a boy being sent off to his first day at school.  He surprises Athos, hugging him.  Then Phillippe opens the door and walks slowly down the hallway. Athos stands at the door and watches him go, all alone. Athos whispers, though Phillippe can't hear... \nATHOS You have the heart of a king. \nReluctantly, he shuts the door behind Phillippe. \nIN THE HALLWAY, FOLLOWING PHILLIPPE \nGUESTS To King Louis, and the Queen Mother! \nEveryone drinks; Phillippe suddenly remembers to hold his glass in his fingertips -- and it slips through his nervous fingers, hitting the floor with a crash. \nDead silence; everyone is looking.  Then Anne drops her glass too -- and everybody does it, as if to break the glass is part of the celebration. \nAs the music begins again, Anne leans to Phillippe -- \nANNE I retire now.  Wait two waltzes, then retire to your room; and spend the night in safety.  We have much to talk about, and have the rest of our lives to do it. \nPHILLIPPE Good night, Mother. \nANNE Good night... my son. \nShe kisses him on the cheek; it brings tears to both of them. She moves to the door, everyone bowing as she leaves. \nJUST OUTSIDE THE BALLROOM DOOR \nAnne encounters d'Artagnan.  He stops, so taken by the sight of her that no one seeing them could miss that he loves her. \nD'ARTAGNAN Anne!  You look -- \nRemembering himself, he bows deeply. \nD'ARTAGNAN My Queen... \nANNE D'Artagnan. \nShe takes his hand, not caring who is watching. \nD'ARTAGNAN I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight. \nANNE We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow. \nShe moves off, toward her room.  D'Artagnan enters the ballroom. \nINT.  BALLROOM - NIGHT \nD'Artagnan sees \"Louis\" sitting on the throne.  More baffled than alarmed, he grabs one of the Musketeer guards near him. \nD'ARTAGNAN How long has the King been back? \nGUARD Some while, Captain. \nD'ARTAGNAN He didn't pass my doorway, I was in my room. \nGUARD He must've, Captain, there is no other way here. \nD'Artagnan stands and thinks; his mind begins to spin. \nPHILLIPPE \nsees d'Artagnan, staring at him... then calling more guards over and giving them quick instructions; the guards hurry away.  Then d'Artagnan moves to Phillippe, and bows.  He looks at him carefully, but seems to see nothing unusual. \nPHILLIPPE Continue. \nD'ARTAGNAN Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me. \nPHILLIPPE ... The ball... Continue. \nD'ARTAGNAN I must insist, Sire. \nPhillippe stands, and follows d'Artagnan from the ball. \nINT.  PASSAGES TO RIVER - NIGHT \nAramis, Athos and Porthos -- carrying Louis -- descend the secret passages to the foundations of the palace, into a drainage channel leading to the river. \nThey have stashed a boat there; they plop Louis into it and climb in themselves.  They row toward the archway that is the exit to the river; the moonlit waters of the Seine glow outside, like a beacon of safe escape. \nBut the steel grate of the archway slams down just before they reach it, and blades point at them from every angle of the darkness.  A shielded lantern rises and its wick is turned up, revealing \nD'ARTAGNAN \nhe stands with a small contingent of young Musketeers.  His eyes are intense, his face in agony. \nD'ARTAGNAN My friends. \nThe only one they can see it d'Artagnan.  They all look at each other, in the small circle of light from the lantern. \nD'ARTAGNAN Only we four, the most trusted Musketeers, knew about the passages, meant to keep the King safe... Your Majesty... \nPhillippe steps out of the darkness; his eyes are full of shame and failure as he looks at Athos, but still he holds on, trying to maintain the charade that he is Louis. \nPHILLIPPE Yes...?  Why do you bring me here, d'Artagnan? \nD'ARTAGNAN I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled -- \nLOUIS My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now. \nANNE'S VOICE No!! \nThey whirl to see the Queen Mother, who has entered through the main door.  She hurries to the space between her sons, hugging Phillippe, then trying to hug Louis. \nANNE Louis, please -- ! \nLOUIS My guards are useless!  Take her from me! \nHe motions to the young Musketeers to restrain her; reluctantly they grip the arms of the Queen Mother. \nLOUIS What had you to do with this, Mother? \nANNE He is your brother! \nLOUIS He is nothing now. \nLouis draws a sword from the scabbard of one of the young Musketeers -- but d'Artagnan steps between him and Phillippe. \nD'ARTAGNAN Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France. \nLOUIS Get out of my way. \nD'ARTAGNAN Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother. \nLOUIS Forgive?! \nD'ARTAGNAN Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them. \nLOUIS They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will! \nD'Artagnan sinks to his knees before the king. \nD'ARTAGNAN Your Majesty... Every day of your life, I have watched over you.  No angel could have stood a more faithful vigil.  I have bled for you, and have prayed, every day, to see you become greater than your office, better than the law.  Show me now what my faith and blood have purchased.  Show mercy. \nThe words cut into everyone:  Anne, Phillippe, the young Musketeers.  But Louis' eyes are cold, as he responds -- \nLOUIS You take the side of traitors? \nPHILLIPPE Please, may I speak?  M'lord... I beg that you kill me.  I release you, before Almighty God, from any claim of sin in taking my life.  In fact I will pray that God reward you for your mercy to do it.  But do not -- I beg you -- return me to the prison, where I have lived so long. \nPhillippe's plea makes Louis pause... then smile. \nLOUIS D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate. \nANNE No, Louis!  No! \nLOUIS Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!! \nAnne screams, and Louis waves to the guards, who draw her from the room, as d'Artagnan sags, on his knees before the King he has served so faithfully. \nSlowly, Phillippe lowers his head. \nINT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM \nD'Artagnan returns to his bare room; he sits down upon the bed and drops his face into his hands. \nThen he hears the sound, like a SCREAM, but short and muffled, almost like the whelp of a kicked dog.  He lifts his head sharply; where did that sound come from?  He is almost too tired, too sad, to investigate. \nThen the King, already shaken by the night's events, hurries into d'Artagnan's room. \nLOUIS What was that sound?!  Did you hear it?  It came from Michelle's room! \nINT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER \nD'Artagnan enters, ahead of Louis.  They see nothing unusual, and d'Artagnan moves up the hidden stairs toward Michelle's apartment. \nMICHELLE'S APARTMENT \nD'Artagnan enters the room, and finds it empty -- but the window is open.  He moves toward it... \nINT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER \nThe King is pacing as d'Artagnan reappears. \nLOUIS Where is Michelle? \nD'ARTAGNAN There. \nHe points to the window.  Louis shoves open the drapes and leaps back in horror.  Michelle has hanged herself outside Louis' window, the golden bunting of her bed tied as a noose around her neck. \nINT.  QUEEN MOTHER'S APARTMENTS - DAWN \nARAMIS He seeks redemption. \nATHOS You're a fool! \nARAMIS Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King. \nATHOS So what has changed? \nARAMIS Perhaps he serves a different king. \nPORTHOS What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go. \nATHOS You are right.  But it is a trap. \nPORTHOS So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss. \nARAMIS Then to the Bastille. \nATHOS To the Bastille.  And death. \nEXT.  BASTILLE - NIGHT \nThe stone walls rising into the Paris night seem to ooze evil.  The building looks impossible to get into, much less get out of; its doors appear to be solid blocks of wood, encased in stone ramparts. \nWe hear a sharp, echoing KNOCK; Aramis, Athos, and Porthos stand outside the main entrance, Athos slumped between the other two like a beaten captive being delivered to jail. \nNo one answers their knock; the three Musketeers exchange doubtful glance, and Porthos knocks again.  A guard inside slides open a view port of the massive door. \nPORTHOS Open up!  We have a prisoner! \nThe port shuts, bolts rattle, and the great door heaves open. The Musketeers glance at each other again, and play their roles, Aramis and Porthos dragging Athos inside. \nINT.  THE BASTILLE - MAIN COURTYARD - NIGHT \nThe prison courtyard is murky in the darkness, and ringed by doors leading into mazes of corridors to its dungeons. \nGUARD Take him down to level three.  The Captain will see to the documents. \nAramis and Porthos drag Athos into one of the shadowy portals surrounding the courtyard. \nINT.  BASTILLE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT \nThe three Musketeers duck into the inky shadows; Aramis cuts the bonds that hold Athos' hands, and gives him the extra sword he had beneath his cloak. \nPORTHOS It worked! \nATHOS It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out! \nAramis shushes them, and leads them into another quiet corridor.  They hear the distant bells of a church, then suddenly they must scramble, as a platoon of guards carrying torches troop up stairs into the corridor; the Musketeers dart like rats into dark nooks; as the guards pass, the Musketeers huddle, and the bells end their tolling. \nARAMIS Midnight!  We have ten minutes! \nThey press on, deeper into the Bastille. \nINT.  PALACE - ANNE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nAnne moves to the window, where she starts to kneel for her nightly prayer; but she stops.  Outside in the garden, far below her window, is d'Artagnan on horseback, waiting.  Their eyes connect.  He has a single rose in his hand.  Never taking his eyes from her, he places the rose on the stone bench of the garden, and reins his horse away. \nThen she understands what he was trying to tell her before, in the hallway; it was goodbye. \nEXT.  PALACE GARDEN - NIGHT \nD'Artagnan rides away quickly, passing -- without seeing -- Lieutenant Andre, who has been watching him. \nEXT.  PARIS STREETS - NIGHT \nThrough the night d'Artagnan gallops.  We see his destination in the distance:  the Bastille. \nEXT.  THE PALACE GATES - NIGHT \nThe great gates of the palace swing slowly open, and out ride a whole platoon of young Musketeers, surrounding Louis himself, on horseback and dressed like a soldier. \nINT.  THE BASTILLE - VARIOUS SHOTS \nThe three Musketeers scramble down a flight of stairs, through another corridor, down another stairway.  They pass cells; wretched prisoners look up, but none of them is Phillippe.  Then the Musketeers surprise a JAILER. \nJAILER Hey...! \nBut before the man can say anything else, Porthos has crushed him like a bug against the wall.  They rip the huge ring of keys from the jailer's waist, and take his torch. \nPHILLIPPE'S CELL \nHe lies on the floor; he sees the light of a torch, coming to him like sunrise... and then he hears a voice -- \nATHOS Phillippe...? \nLOUIS D'Artagnan! \nAT THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR \nLouis' voice echoes down to the veteran Musketeers and Phillippe, in the Iron Mask. \nLOUIS' VOICE I am not angry with you.  I knew you would lead me to them, and so you have!  Lay down your sword, and I will not punish you!  I will let you retire in peace -- to live out your days in the countryside!  And I will give your friends a swift execution, if you surrender now. \nThe words bounce down the long corridor; then silence. D'Artagnan stands holding his sword, staring away from his friends, toward the King and his gang of young Musketeers. \nARAMIS D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway. \nPORTHOS He is right, d'Artagnan. \nAthos says nothing; but when d'Artagnan looks at him, he lowers his eyes in shame for ever having doubted d'Artagnan's loyalty and friendship. \nPhillippe speaks up, from behind the Iron Mask. \nPHILLIPPE Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace. \nD'ARTAGNAN No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son. \nThis hits them like a bombshell -- and suddenly it all makes sense; d'Artagnan's loyalty to Louis, his dogged hope that he could somehow influence him toward goodness.  We see their stunned faces, each in turn:  Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and Phillippe. \nD'ARTAGNAN I never had any idea you existed... until they found you.  And in all that time, I never had a moment's pride as a father -- until now. \nD'Artagnan and Phillippe embrace, lost father to lost son. \nFrom the heavily barred door to their rear comes a powerful pounding; the Bastille's soldiers are trying to break it down.  Time is running out. \nAramis looks back down the corridor toward the door to the outside, barred now by Louis and his young guards, their long muskets bristling like spikes; and yet that way is the only possible hope for escape to the outside. \nARAMIS D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them? \nD'ARTAGNAN I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way. \nHe draws his sword and points it into the air.  Aramis lifts the tip of his sword to join that of d'Artagnan.  Porthos does too... and then Athos joins them. \nATHOS One for all.  All for one. \nPHILLIPPE If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you. \nD'Artagnan gives Phillippe a dagger.  They look at each other.  Then d'Artagnan begins to scream.  The others take up the shout.  Then they step around the corner, and charge. \nTHE LAST CHARGE OF THE MUSKETEERS \nWe film it in all its glory, a visual feast:  the Last Charge of the Musketeers.  Their capes swirl about time, their hair flies, their legs take on new life. \nAt first the young Musketeers at the end of the corridor are frozen in surprise; their youthful Lieutenant is awed by the dashing, beautiful bravery of the thing. \nLIEUTENANT Magnificent valor... \nLOUIS Shoot them!  Shoot them! \nLouis grabs a musket from one of the reluctant soldiers and fires:  SSSBOOM!  With the first explosion of gunfire the others pull their triggers; the powder in their weapons flashes and crashes... \nThe musket balls fly down the hallway, sparking off the stone walls and floor, ricocheting, punching holes through the capes and flesh... but still the Musketeers charge like the young men they once were -- still are, in spirit. \nIn the confines of the Bastille's stone corridor the noise is deafening, and the space in front of the guards is filled with the dense gray smoke of the gunpowder.  None of them can see anything beyond it... and all is quiet. \nLIEUTENANT Draw blades! \nThe King's Guards draw their swords, and wait; are all the old Musketeers dead? \nSlowly the figures emerge from the smoke -- in SLOW MOTION, walking now, no need to run.  All are wounded, but all are still alive. \nThe Four Musketeers, along with Phillippe, move slowly and steadily toward the blades of the young Guards; a fight to the death?  So be it. \nBut the young Lieutenant will have none of it; as one of his men lifts a sword to plunge it into the chest of d'Artagnan, the young Lieutenant bats the sword down, with his own. \nLIEUTENANT Stop! \nHe steps forward toward d'Artagnan; but instead of thrusting his sword he salutes with it. \nHis men follow suit, saluting and bowing to the courage of these men they have grown up wanting to follow. \nKing Louis, for the moment, is frozen. \nD'Artagnan looks back at Phillippe; he has bullet holes in two different places at the edges of his clothes, but he is unwounded. \nThen d'Artagnan sees Louis, with his long dagger, leaping at Phillippe. \nD'ARTAGNAN NO! \nD'Artagnan throws himself between the two twins and hurls Louis backwards, then spins to Phillippe. \n", "test1_input": "ANNE And you were not hurt? \nD'ARTAGNAN No, M'lady. \nANNE That is good. \nWithout a change of expression on her still beautiful but sad face, she enters her room. \nINT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - EVENING \nD'Artagnan returns to his room, just as a young LIEUTENANT of Musketeers (Andre) arrives with two of the Royal Guards. \nLIEUTENANT Duty lists of the day, Captain! \nD'ARTAGNAN Thank you, Andre. \nThey hand him the list and salute again, to leave. \nD'ARTAGNAN Wait.  There is an entry here -- \"Messenger sent by King to residence of Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.\" Why was that? \nThe young Musketeers try not to smirk. \nLIEUTENANT Well, Captain... \nINT.  ATHOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAthos sits alone, playing a haunting melody on a violin.  It is a sad tune, played with feeling; he stops as he hears a KNOCK at his door, and opens it to -- \nATHOS D'Artagnan! \nD'ARTAGNAN Athos, my friend! \nThey embrace with deep affection -- friends who have shared each other's darkest times. \nD'ARTAGNAN It's been too long. \nATHOS Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine. \nD'Artagnan takes one of the wooden chairs, by the meager fire.  The whole place is modest at best. \nD'ARTAGNAN Thanks, but not for me. \nATHOS You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months? \nD'ARTAGNAN I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it. \nATHOS Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh? \nD'ARTAGNAN They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today. \nATHOS Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four? \nD'ARTAGNAN I heard your playing. \nATHOS I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope. \nA cloud passes d'Artagnan's face; he has something to tell Athos. \nD'ARTAGNAN Athos... \nBut whatever it is that d'Artagnan wants to say is interrupted by the sound of someone climbing the stairs.  As Athos' face brightened with the arrival of d'Artagnan, now it glows as he jumps up to welcome his son. \nATHOS That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful! \nRAOUL Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace. \nAthos is stunned; d'Artagnan witnesses this with agony. \nATHOS But -- are you sure? \nRAOUL We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother. \nATHOS Michelle cannot possibly accept! \nRAOUL She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet. \nATHOS Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ? \nRAOUL Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that. \nATHOS Die?  What...? \nRAOUL I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge. \nATHOS Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No. \n", "test1_true": "ATHOS Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken -- \nBut Raoul stops him, with an embrace. \nRAOUL Goodbye, father.  I am sorry. \nATHOS Raoul -- \nRaoul breaks away, and runs from the room.  Athos, so joyful moments before, holds his head as if his brain might erupt. \nATHOS This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king! \nD'ARTAGNAN If the young woman truly loves Raoul -- \nATHOS She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love! \nD'Artagnan is silent, and even ashamed.  Athos realizes -- \nATHOS You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came. \nD'ARTAGNAN I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope. \nATHOS What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul -- \nD'ARTAGNAN I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting. \nATHOS Raoul is everything to me. \nD'ARTAGNAN I know. \nATHOS Oh my friend. \nAthos grips d'Artagnan in gratitude and desperate hope. \nD'ARTAGNAN I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused. \nATHOS You trust his character more than anyone else does. \nD'ARTAGNAN Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too. \nATHOS Save my son, d'Artagnan. \nThey embrace once more, and d'Artagnan leaves. \nEXT.  PARIS STREETS - DAY \nMagnificent public buildings -- palaces and cathedrals -- grace the city's skyline, but here in central Paris all is squalor.  On a narrow, filthy street, beggars bother the sullen city peasants who are weak with hunger themselves. \nBut interest perks up when two soldiers drive up in a wagon, and one of them, Lieutenant Andre, announces -- \nLIEUTENANT Here is food, the gift of your loving King, on his birthday!  He gives to himself by giving to you, in that he loves you so much! \nSlowly at first the paupers stand and shuffle forward.  As the soldiers begin handing out foodstuffs -- bread, cabbages, tomatoes, eggs -- those nearest the wagon begin to jostle each other, and a large crowd gathers quickly. \nLIEUTENANT No need to fight, there is plenty for all! \nIt's looking like a holiday celebration... until a RUFFIAN breaks open a loaf of bread, and wrinkles his nose. \nRUFFIAN This stuff stinks.  It is rotting! The King gives us rotten food! \nHe hurls the moldy bread back at the soldiers.  Other paupers sniff the food, and its stink set off an explosion of anger: they throw food at the soldiers... Then a paving stone crashes through a shop window, and suddenly it's a riot, with the mob overwhelming the soldiers and dragging them down the streets in the direction of the palace. \nD'ARTAGNAN, riding toward the palace himself, turns a corner and sees the mob coming.  And they see him:  the elegant, dashing Musketeer on the prancing stallion. \nAnd at that moment, two more soldiers race out of a side street, fleeing a similar mob, coming from another direction. D'Artagnan understands everything at a glance; the second pair of fleeing soldiers reach him in panic. \nPANICKED SOLDIER Back, toward the palace!  We cannot hold them off!  We will fire a volley into them! \nD'ARTAGNAN No!  Run to the palace and close the gates.  But do not fire! \nThe two new soldiers race away; d'Artagnan waits calmly on his horse, as the mobs from both directions converge on him. \nTHE MOB, seeing the dashing Musketeer wait so confidently for them, slow up; but the ruffian urges them on. \nRUFFIAN Come on!  To the palace! \nD'Artagnan sits calmly in their way.  He doesn't even draw his sword, though members of the mob grab the reins of his horse.  Some of the mob recognize him, and murmur... \nMOB It's d'Artagnan!  Le Generale de Musketeers! \nThe mob hesitates -- for the name d'Artagnan means heroism and patriotism to all of them. \nRUFFIAN One Musketeer can't stop us! \n", "test1_id": 1314, "test2_input": "Without another word he goes back the way he came.  Raoul grips his musket and looks around him; he finds himself among several dozen stark eyed men manning the forward curve of the trench.  He has little time to wonder what will happen next. A horn trumpets close by, and with a shout, the French soldiers clamber out of their breastworks. \nFor an instant, Raoul hesitates in pure terror, then joins the charge with a shout of his own -- \nRAOUL Mi-cheeelllll!! -- \nOn the stone wall looming above the French soldiers, orange blossoms of fire -- the muzzle flash of primitive cannons -- penetrate the smoke, and the ground at Raoul's feet explodes, hurling him backwards.  He covered barely a few feet, and falls almost exactly where he started. \nDead. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE - THE DOOR OF ATHOS' ROOMS - DAY \nA gloved hand raps on the door.  Athos opens it to a military messenger, who shoves at him a single sheet of paper, rolled and tied with ribbon. \nINT.  ATHOS' ROOM - NIGHT \nThe message slams onto the table as Athos staggers upon it, his legs buckling beneath him in shock and grief. \nINT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - DAY \nD'Artagnan is working at his desk, as the Lieutenant enters. \nLIEUTENANT Sir... a casualty report came... \nD'Artagnan looks at the paper the Lieutenant hands him. \nD'ARTAGNAN No, no, no... \nHe sags for a moment, then grabs his cloak and sword. \nINT./ EXT.  MUSKETEER'S GATE OF THE PALACE - DAY \nThe Musketeer's Gate is close to the stables where the Musketeers train and keep their horses.  D'Artagnan hurries from the Palace and snaps an order. \nD'ARTAGNAN Saddle my horse! \nThe grooms jump to work; several young Musketeers nearby stop their training, noticing their Captain's agitation. \nD'ARTAGNAN Hurry -- \nBut then d'Artagnan sees Athos coming, riding furiously through the Musketeers' gate.  D'Artagnan steps out to meet him as Athos reins in his horse and jumps from the saddle. \nD'ARTAGNAN Athos, my friend -- \nAthos marches to the palace door; d'Artagnan cuts him off. \nD'ARTAGNAN Athos, please...! \nATHOS Get out of my way. \nD'ARTAGNAN (grabbing him) Athos, I beg you -- \nAthos punches d'Artagnan with furious strength, knocking him aside.  The young Musketeers reach for their weapons, but d'Artagnan is up quickly, throwing himself in front of Athos again, blocking the doorway into the palace. \nD'ARTAGNAN Where are you going? \nATHOS To kill the king. \nAt this, the swords of the young Musketeers sing from their scabbards.  Athos wears a sword, but he has not drawn it. \nD'ARTAGNAN Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself. \nATHOS The King killed my son! \nD'ARTAGNAN The cannons killed Raoul!  The cannons, and love.  But not the King. \nA YOUNG MUSKETEER steps up. \nYOUNG MUSKETEER I'll kill the old man for you, Captain, if you don't wish to -- \nAthos spins, striking like a rattlesnake, his sword whipping from its scabbard and slicing off the arrogant young Musketeer's ear.  He flicks another's sword from his grasp, then brings the the point of his own blade up beneath the chin of a third, shoving him back. \nATHOS Come on!  All of you! \nD'Artagnan tackles Athos from behind and pins him face down to the hay.  For a moment Athos bellows in rage -- \nATHOS Coward!  Fight me!  Fight me...! \nEmotion spills up into Athos' throat, and he begins to sob. \nATHOS He killed my son, d'Artagnan!  He killed my son...! \nD'Artagnan, dying inside, still grips Athos.  Athos grows quiet, and the young Musketeers drift closer. \n", "test2_true": "D'Artagnan stands, and Athos rises, still holding his sword. He looks at d'Artagnan a long beat, then sheathes his sword and turns to his horse.  The young soldiers move to him. \nD'ARTAGNAN Let him go! \nAthos mounts his horse, and with a last glance back at d'Artagnan, he gallops away. \nINT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY \nThe King has just climaxed in his lovemaking, and lies spent upon Michelle.  His rest is interrupted by a KNOCK at his door.  The King scowls. \nLOUIS What?! \nVOICE Your Majesty... it is Andre. \nLouis groans, and pulls on a robe.  Michelle whispers -- \nMICHELLE Shall I leave? \nLOUIS No, you may wait behind the screen. \nMichelle rises and slips behind a painted dressing screen as Louis goes to the door and admits the young Lieutenant. \nBEHIND THE SCREEN, Michelle lifts a jeweled hand mirror and appraises her face; she begins brushing her long hair.  She can hear the conversation... \nLIEUTENANT I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed -- \nLOUIS Yes, yes, go on. \nLIEUTENANT Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate. \nBehind the screen, Michelle pauses at the mention of Athos. \nLOUIS Did they kill him? \nLIEUTENANT No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front. \nCRASH!  From behind the screen comes the sound of the mirror, shattering as it drops to the floor.  It startles the Lieutenant, but the King goes on... \nLOUIS Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace? \nLIEUTENANT ... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way. \nLOUIS You may go, Lieutenant. \nThe Lieutenant moves back to the door. \nLIEUTENANT Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty? \nLOUIS Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it. \nThe Lieutenant leaves, and Louis moves behind the screen to see Michelle stagger and grip the dressing table; her bare feet step onto the broken glass of the mirror, yet she is oblivious to the cuts.  Louis sees this and grabs her. \nLOUIS My dear!  The glass -- ! \nHe pulls her to the couch and draws a blanket about her, cuddling her as she begins to shake. \nMICHELLE Did you know... about Raoul? \nLOUIS I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger. \nHe cuddles her as she weeps. \nLOUIS I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven. \nMICHELLE Oh Louis, Louis... \nShe clings to him in her grief. \nEXT.  NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY \nThe great cathedral rises next to the monastery where Aramis resides.  We PAN DOWN and PUSH IN on the cobblestones between the two structures, as if penetrating to -- \nSUBTERRANEAN PASSAGES \nAramis leads Porthos through tunnels, twisting, descending. \nPORTHOS Aramis... is this the way to hell? \nARAMIS Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip. \nThey reach an iron door and move through it, into \nA GORGEOUS, SECRET CHAPEL \n", "test2_id": 1315, "test3_input": "Candles illuminate masterpiece frescoes.  The place is breathtaking. \nPORTHOS Where are we? \nARAMIS Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river? \nPorthos notices niches in the walls; he looks closely and sees the face of a corpse, enclosed behind glass. \nPORTHOS Mother of God! \nARAMIS It is also a place of burial. \nPORTHOS A tomb?  We're in a tomb? \nARAMIS Catacombs.  Very holy. \nPorthos looks as if the bodies could resurrect at any moment -- then jumps out of his skin as the door opens. \nPORTHOS Yaaaahhh! \nA hooded figure, looking like the Grim Reaper, enters. \nARAMIS Relax, you big fool, it's d'Artagnan. \nAnd sure enough the hooded figure, whom we now see has been led in by a little monk, is d'Artagnan.  Aramis nods to the monk, who leaves quickly.  Before d'Artagnan can ask anything, Porthos jumps again; the back door has opened, and monks usher in Athos, who freezes as he sees d'Artagnan. \nARAMIS It's all right.  D'Artagnan was the one who warned us that he'd been given an order for your arrest. Here you have sanctuary -- does he not, d'Artagnan? \nThe escort monks disappear, closing the chapel door so that the four Musketeers are left to sit at a small table the monks have set up, Athos and D'Artagnan opposite each other. \nARAMIS Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it. \nD'ARTAGNAN We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword. \nATHOS And some problems cannot be settled without one. \nARAMIS Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way. \nPORTHOS But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King? \nARAMIS So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection? \nPORTHOS It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be. \nARAMIS Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France. \nA stunned silence. \nATHOS What do you propose to do? \nARAMIS Replace the king. \nD'ARTAGNAN I cannot hear this! \nPORTHOS It can't be done. \nARAMIS It can.  I know the way. \nATHOS I am with you! \nD'ARTAGNAN No!  Stop -- \nARAMIS I will need you all.  All for one. One for all. \nD'ARTAGNAN (jumping up) You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him! \nATHOS It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor! \nD'ARTAGNAN An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed! \nATHOS Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor! \nD'ARTAGNAN No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him. \nAthos leaps up from the table, and glares at d'Artagnan. \nATHOS Whatever the plan... I am in it! The next time we meet, one of us will die. \nHe storms out of the rear door of the chapel. \nARAMIS Porthos, see to Athos, won't you? \nPorthos follows Athos; Aramis and d'Artagnan are left alone. \nARAMIS I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone. \n", "test3_true": "D'Artagnan moves to the door. \nD'ARTAGNAN I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life. \nARAMIS I know.  God go with you. \nD'Artagnan leaves Aramis alone in the secret chapel. \nEXT.  THE MONASTERY - NIGHT \nAramis leads Athos and Porthos out of the catacombs. \nARAMIS This way. \nThey move into a moonlit courtyard of the monastery.  A hooded Jesuit standing guard steps from the shadows, then recognizes Aramis and admits the trio to the monastery's forge, where more hooded Jesuits are working in secret, heating iron red hot in the bellows furnace. \nATHOS What are they doing? \nARAMIS Making the key to the throne. \nPORTHOS They are very large keys. \nOne of the blacksmiths uses tongs to remove something red from the fire; he hammers it in a shower of sparks and plunges it into water.  Aramis pulls the result from the water and shows it to Athos and Porthos. \nIt is an iron mask. \nEXT.  A CARRIAGE - FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT \nThe carriage rolls through the long sweep of the French countryside, traveling fast. \nINT.  THE CARRIAGE - NIGHT \nThe three Musketeers -- Aramis, Athos, and Porthos -- have been traveling for some time.  Porthos is asleep, snoring. \nATHOS Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting? \nARAMIS Soon enough.  Here we are. \nKicking Porthos' feet to wake him, Aramis opens the carriage door, and they step out... \nEXT.  FRENCH COAST - NIGHT \nLying just off the coast is the forbidden island, where the imposing fortress prison rises on the promontory off shore. \nATHOS The Prison of Belle Sur. \nARAMIS Come, we have a boat waiting. \nAs hooded Jesuits appear from the shadows to guide them, Athos and Porthos glance at each other; Porthos shrugs. \nEXT.  AMONG ROCKS AT THE BEACH - NIGHT \nThe guides lead the Musketeers down a hilly path to a long boat, hidden among the large rocks that dot the coast. Sitting next to the boat is a scrawny little man in priest's garb; at his feet is a long narrow bundle, about the size of a mummy, with a rope tied at either end. \nThe guides drag the boat across the sand into the surf. Aramis throws off his cape, and strips down almost naked. He's still fit and hard.  With the guides helping him, he lifts the bundle by its ropes and ties it around his waist. \nATHOS What is that? \nARAMIS A body. \nATHOS I see that is a body!  But where did you get it? \nAramis ignores the question, and the guides dress him in priest's garb.  With the robes spreading over the big bundle added artfully to Aramis' waist, it appears he is a very fat priest; the wig and false beard the assistants give him adds to the illusion of Aramis as a wild, reclusive monk. \nThe sun is beginning to come up over the mountains. \nPORTHOS He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day. \nATHOS Who does? \nPORTHOS Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it. \nAramis steps onto the boat.

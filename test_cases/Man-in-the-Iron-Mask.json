{"test1_input": "The Man in the Iron Mask - 9/18/95 First Draft by Randall Wallace \nTHE MAN IN THE IRON MASK \nby \nRandall Wallace \nFIRST DRAFT \nSeptember 18, 1995 \nFADE IN: \nFrom the BLACKNESS before the first images, we hear a young woman's tortured SCREAM, muffled by her own will.  We see her mouth, open in agony; her face, beaded with sweat.  Her name is ANNE, and she is Queen of France.  She lies in \nA ROYAL BEDCHAMBER \nThe royal DOCTOR kneels at the foot of her bed; her own royal mother grips her hands... \nOn the opposite side of the huge bedchamber, and separated from the queen's bed by an artistically painted screen, are royal ADVISORS sweating and anxious for any word to take to their king.  They wince as the Queen moans again in the pain of childbirth. \nHer fingers claw out for help, but her Doctor ignores her need to be touched and comforted; he is concerned only for the baby.  Only her PRIEST, FATHER BELLES, sits at her head, stroking her hair gently and rapidly whispering prayers. \nDOCTOR The head is born!  One arm... the other arm... it is a boy! \nThe advisors, disregarding the Queen's privacy, scurry around the screen to see the doctor lift the beautiful baby, wet with birth.  The mother -- the Queen -- is still in agony, yet she struggles to lift her head. \nADVISOR 1 I shall tell the king! \nADVISOR 2 I shall tell him! \nThey hurry for the door.  But their race to be first to bring this great news to the King is interrupted as the Queen emits another cry; it surprises the doctor. \nDOCTOR M'lady...? \nHe kneels again to examine the Queen. \nDOCTOR Another...?  It is another! \nThe joy vanishes from the faces of the advisors.  They look gravely at each other, as they hear a second BABY'S CRY. \nSMASH TO: \nA DARK COURTYARD - NIGHT \nA door groans open in a hidden corner of the palace courtyard and into the darkness steps a dashing figure.  His face is hidden in shadow, but we know from the silhouette of his cloak and plumed hat that he is a MUSKETEER. \nHe carries an OBLONG BASKET. \nA carriage is just rattling onto the flagstones of the courtyard.  The Musketeer steps into its interior, with a sharp word to the driver -- \nMUSKETEER Away. \nThe whip CRACKS and the carriage plunges into the night. \nTIME DISSOLVE: \nEXT.  ESTABLISHING THE ISLAND FORTRESS PRISON - DAY \nOn a gash of rock thrusting upward from the sea along the southern coast of France stands an island fortress, a prison, like an Alcatraz of the Mediterranean.  Just off a coastline renowned for its beauty, the fortress is horrible and foreboding.  As we SUPERIMPOSE: \nTWENTY-TWO YEARS LATER \nINT.  THE FORTRESS PRISON \nWith the camera as our moving POV, we survey the prison.  It is a horrible place:  dungeons where prisoners lie in their own filth; corners where jailers rut with unresisting captive women; long twisting corridors lined with cells, from which prisoners whimper, or moan in madness.  Up a long winding staircase our POV moves; we push through the barred window of a cell... It is somewhat cleaner than the rest of the places we've seen, but still a prison.  We PAN the cell. \nAnd we see a man.  A MAN IN AN IRON MASK.  It is terrifying, to think of anyone imprisoned in this way.  We push in on his eyes... They are blue, childlike. \nA greasy jailer -- the prisoner's KEEPER -- puts his face to the barred window of the door, and speaks with bored cruelty. \nKEEPER You dead yet? \nMAN IN THE IRON MASK No, Keeper. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  ESTABLISHING PARIS - DAY \nSUPERIMPOSE: \nPARIS \nEXT.  PARIS STREET - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "D'ARTAGNAN \nfamous Musketeer, Captain of the King's Royal Bodyguard.  He is still handsome at mid-life, still erect, unambiguous in his courage and his loyalty. \nHe rides past a knot of angry beggars, moving through the streets breaking windows and scavenging for food.  When they see d'Artagnan, some throw rocks at him.  They sail by d'Artagnan's head; he ducks them with the fluid grace of a boxer dodging punches, and keeps on riding. \nOUTSIDE THE CATHEDRAL \nD'Artagnan rides into the courtyard of a grand old residence beside Notre Dame Cathedral.  Priests are dispensing food to beggars gathered in the courtyard.  As d'Artagnan reins his horse to a stop the wretched people stare with contempt at the royal symbols on his uniform.  But d'Artagnan is not a man anyone would be quick to confront; as he dismounts and moves toward the doorways the people part for him. \nHe pauses as he sees, parked to one side of the old residence, a big rickety carriage.  D'Artagnan smiles. \nD'ARTAGNAN Porthos too! \nD'Artagnan hears drunken feminine giggles echoing down the staircase of the tower above him. \nINT.  PRIESTS' RESIDENCE - A STAIRWAY - DAY \nFour people are moving up a winding stairway; three are women, bosoms spilling from their gaudy dresses; the fourth is PORTHOS, the former Musketeer, now a nobleman of great wealth and even greater girth.  He and the women are drinking wine as they stagger up the stairs, the women towing Porthos like rowboats tugging a ship to dock.  Porthos is not so drunk that his hands fail to find pleasant places to grip their bodies as they walk and giggle. \nPORTHOS Ah ha!  Here we are!  Aramis! Porthos is here! \nThey reach a doorway.  Porthos kicks it open, staggers back, and begins shoving the women inside. \nINT.  A PRIEST'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThe first of the partying women tumbles inside; she stops short at what she sees.  The second and third stumble in after her and they too stop dead still, sobered by what they see.  Then with a great roar Porthos barrels in. \nPORTHOS Aaaaaaaramis!!  Porthos is -- \nHe stops dead in his tracks.  From the POV OF PORTHOS AND THE WOMEN, we see ARAMIS.  Always the most theological of the Musketeers, and ruthlessly brilliant, he is still lean and powerful.  And still handsome, or at least he would be; but now he kneels before a single candle at a private altar, wearing sackcloth and ashes in penitent prayer. \nPORTHOS Sorry, my dears.  You would have enjoyed it too.  He's hung like a donkey. \nWENCH 1 So are you. \nPORTHOS Really?  I haven't been able to see it for fifteen years.  Go on now, leave His Holiness alone.  I'll bring you back tomorrow when he's in a better mood. \nHe whacks their bottoms, herding them out, then swaggers to Aramis, heaving himself to a seat beside his praying friend. \nPORTHOS Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone -- \nARAMIS Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying? \nPORTHOS I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes. \nARAMIS (trying to ignore him) There are more important things than tits. \nPORTHOS Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral. \nAramis is still trying to pray, but rises to the bait. \nARAMIS Forgiveness. \nPORTHOS Forgiveness? \nAs if in reply, Porthos lets rip an enormous rolling fart. \nPORTHOS (beat) Forgive me. \nAramis' fingers clamp down on the rosary beads, as he tries to keep praying. \nPORTHOS Am I forgiven? \nAramis abruptly backhands his huge friend.  Porthos reels backwards, landing in a chair. \nPORTHOS I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple. \nARAMIS Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?! \nPorthos raises a foot and kicks the bishop in the balls. Aramis staggers back and grabs a chair to throw it; Porthos picks up the whole table -- just as d'Artagnan enters. \nPORTHOS AND ARAMIS D'Artagnan. \nPorthos tosses the table aside and bear hugs d'Artagnan. \nPORTHOS How are you, you skinny little pup! \nAramis sets the chair down in embarrassment. \nARAMIS A simple theological discussion. \nD'ARTAGNAN Aramis -- the King wishes to see you. \n", "test1_id": 1314, "test2_input": "GUESTS To King Louis, and the Queen Mother! \nEveryone drinks; Phillippe suddenly remembers to hold his glass in his fingertips -- and it slips through his nervous fingers, hitting the floor with a crash. \nDead silence; everyone is looking.  Then Anne drops her glass too -- and everybody does it, as if to break the glass is part of the celebration. \nAs the music begins again, Anne leans to Phillippe -- \nANNE I retire now.  Wait two waltzes, then retire to your room; and spend the night in safety.  We have much to talk about, and have the rest of our lives to do it. \nPHILLIPPE Good night, Mother. \nANNE Good night... my son. \nShe kisses him on the cheek; it brings tears to both of them. She moves to the door, everyone bowing as she leaves. \nJUST OUTSIDE THE BALLROOM DOOR \nAnne encounters d'Artagnan.  He stops, so taken by the sight of her that no one seeing them could miss that he loves her. \nD'ARTAGNAN Anne!  You look -- \nRemembering himself, he bows deeply. \nD'ARTAGNAN My Queen... \nANNE D'Artagnan. \nShe takes his hand, not caring who is watching. \nD'ARTAGNAN I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight. \nANNE We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow. \nShe moves off, toward her room.  D'Artagnan enters the ballroom. \nINT.  BALLROOM - NIGHT \nD'Artagnan sees \"Louis\" sitting on the throne.  More baffled than alarmed, he grabs one of the Musketeer guards near him. \nD'ARTAGNAN How long has the King been back? \nGUARD Some while, Captain. \nD'ARTAGNAN He didn't pass my doorway, I was in my room. \nGUARD He must've, Captain, there is no other way here. \nD'Artagnan stands and thinks; his mind begins to spin. \nPHILLIPPE \nsees d'Artagnan, staring at him... then calling more guards over and giving them quick instructions; the guards hurry away.  Then d'Artagnan moves to Phillippe, and bows.  He looks at him carefully, but seems to see nothing unusual. \nPHILLIPPE Continue. \nD'ARTAGNAN Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me. \nPHILLIPPE ... The ball... Continue. \nD'ARTAGNAN I must insist, Sire. \nPhillippe stands, and follows d'Artagnan from the ball. \nINT.  PASSAGES TO RIVER - NIGHT \nAramis, Athos and Porthos -- carrying Louis -- descend the secret passages to the foundations of the palace, into a drainage channel leading to the river. \nThey have stashed a boat there; they plop Louis into it and climb in themselves.  They row toward the archway that is the exit to the river; the moonlit waters of the Seine glow outside, like a beacon of safe escape. \nBut the steel grate of the archway slams down just before they reach it, and blades point at them from every angle of the darkness.  A shielded lantern rises and its wick is turned up, revealing \nD'ARTAGNAN \nhe stands with a small contingent of young Musketeers.  His eyes are intense, his face in agony. \nD'ARTAGNAN My friends. \nThe only one they can see it d'Artagnan.  They all look at each other, in the small circle of light from the lantern. \nD'ARTAGNAN Only we four, the most trusted Musketeers, knew about the passages, meant to keep the King safe... Your Majesty... \nPhillippe steps out of the darkness; his eyes are full of shame and failure as he looks at Athos, but still he holds on, trying to maintain the charade that he is Louis. \nPHILLIPPE Yes...?  Why do you bring me here, d'Artagnan? \n", "test2_true": "He means Phillippe. \nD'ARTAGNAN Then who is that lying beside you? \nPorthos turns and looks at Louis -- then reacts as if he's totally surprised at the presence of this man tied up and gagged beside him. \nPORTHOS Wh-- ?  Where did he come from? \nAthos grabs d'Artagnan's arm. \nATHOS If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen. \nD'ARTAGNAN I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot. \nD'Artagnan takes his dagger and cuts the ropes that bind Louis' hands, and the gag that has kept him from talking. Aramis suddenly backhands Louis, knocking him flat on his back in the boat, and pointing to him -- Louis. \nARAMIS This man is an impostor.  We caught him trying to impersonate the King, and were just getting rid of him. \nLouis struggles upright. \nLOUIS D'Artagnan, arrest them all! \nARAMIS Shut up, knave! \nAramis slaps Louis again, and pleads with his eyes that d'Artagnan accept their ruse.  D'Artagnan is dying inside. \nD'ARTAGNAN Before I came here, I insisted the King come with me.  The real Louis would never have let me insist. \nSeeing they are about to be arrested, the old Musketeers in the boat spring into action against their younger counterparts.  Athos swats one swordsman with an oar; Porthos seizes the guard who has grabbed a hold of the boat and flings the man back into two of his comrades; Aramis grabs Louis by the hair and puts his dagger to his throat. \nARAMIS Pull them back, d'Artagnan. \nD'ARTAGNAN You can't do it. \nARAMIS Pull them back! \nD'ARTAGNAN Everyone back. \nARAMIS Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now! \nPhillippe obeys. \nARAMIS Open the gate. \nD'Artagnan nods to his men, and they open the iron gate leading out to the river. \nThe boat makes for the opening.  Just as it is about to reach it, Louis forces Aramis' hand. \nLOUIS You will not shed royal blood! \nHe kicks at the boat and struggles to stand, making the boat tip wildly and throwing everyone in it all around.  Aramis draws the dagger away from Louis' throat to keep from killing him, and d'Artagnan makes a grab at Louis and drags him onto the stone floor of the channel. \nThe boat is almost through the opening -- and Louis snatches at his brother, Phillippe. \nThe current outside the gate is rushing by, and the boat is already caught in the current; it's pulling away and the Musketeers can't stop it.  Athos seizes Phillippe's legs and tries to hold him, but the pressure of the current is great, and now not only Louis but some of the young Musketeers are helping hold Phillippe. \nPhillippe's legs slip out of Athos' grasp, and the boat flashes downriver... \nAramis, Porthos and Athos have escaped... but Phillippe is captured, looking into the hate-filled eyes of his twin brother Louis. \nINT.  SECRET PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT \nLouis is angrily climbing through the passageways, back up into the main floors of the palace, venting his emotions at d'Artagnan, just behind him; the young Musketeers with Phillippe, their prisoner, follow along further back. \nLOUIS I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one! \nD'ARTAGNAN It shall be done, your Majesty. \nLOUIS Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain! \nD'ARTAGNAN Yes, your Majesty. \nThey reach a doorway, and the King bangs through it, into his own bedchamber, still spouting anger. \nLOUIS I was told this impostor was dead! \nD'ARTAGNAN ... You knew you had a double? \nLOUIS He is my brother. \nD'Artagnan is frozen in surprise.  Phillippe and his guards move into the room; seeing him in full light, wearing Louis' own clothes, fans Louis' anger; he jumps forward and begins ripping the royal garments off Phillippe. \nD'Artagnan forces himself between Louis and Phillippe. \n", "test2_id": 1315, "test3_input": "D'ARTAGNAN I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled -- \nLOUIS My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now. \nANNE'S VOICE No!! \nThey whirl to see the Queen Mother, who has entered through the main door.  She hurries to the space between her sons, hugging Phillippe, then trying to hug Louis. \nANNE Louis, please -- ! \nLOUIS My guards are useless!  Take her from me! \nHe motions to the young Musketeers to restrain her; reluctantly they grip the arms of the Queen Mother. \nLOUIS What had you to do with this, Mother? \nANNE He is your brother! \nLOUIS He is nothing now. \nLouis draws a sword from the scabbard of one of the young Musketeers -- but d'Artagnan steps between him and Phillippe. \nD'ARTAGNAN Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France. \nLOUIS Get out of my way. \nD'ARTAGNAN Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother. \nLOUIS Forgive?! \nD'ARTAGNAN Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them. \nLOUIS They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will! \nD'Artagnan sinks to his knees before the king. \nD'ARTAGNAN Your Majesty... Every day of your life, I have watched over you.  No angel could have stood a more faithful vigil.  I have bled for you, and have prayed, every day, to see you become greater than your office, better than the law.  Show me now what my faith and blood have purchased.  Show mercy. \nThe words cut into everyone:  Anne, Phillippe, the young Musketeers.  But Louis' eyes are cold, as he responds -- \nLOUIS You take the side of traitors? \nPHILLIPPE Please, may I speak?  M'lord... I beg that you kill me.  I release you, before Almighty God, from any claim of sin in taking my life.  In fact I will pray that God reward you for your mercy to do it.  But do not -- I beg you -- return me to the prison, where I have lived so long. \nPhillippe's plea makes Louis pause... then smile. \nLOUIS D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate. \nANNE No, Louis!  No! \nLOUIS Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!! \nAnne screams, and Louis waves to the guards, who draw her from the room, as d'Artagnan sags, on his knees before the King he has served so faithfully. \nSlowly, Phillippe lowers his head. \nINT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM \nD'Artagnan returns to his bare room; he sits down upon the bed and drops his face into his hands. \nThen he hears the sound, like a SCREAM, but short and muffled, almost like the whelp of a kicked dog.  He lifts his head sharply; where did that sound come from?  He is almost too tired, too sad, to investigate. \nThen the King, already shaken by the night's events, hurries into d'Artagnan's room. \nLOUIS What was that sound?!  Did you hear it?  It came from Michelle's room! \nINT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER \nD'Artagnan enters, ahead of Louis.  They see nothing unusual, and d'Artagnan moves up the hidden stairs toward Michelle's apartment. \nMICHELLE'S APARTMENT \nD'Artagnan enters the room, and finds it empty -- but the window is open.  He moves toward it... \nINT.  KING'S BEDCHAMBER \nThe King is pacing as d'Artagnan reappears. \nLOUIS Where is Michelle? \nD'ARTAGNAN There. \nHe points to the window.  Louis shoves open the drapes and leaps back in horror.  Michelle has hanged herself outside Louis' window, the golden bunting of her bed tied as a noose around her neck. \nINT.  QUEEN MOTHER'S APARTMENTS - DAWN \n", "test3_true": "D'ARTAGNAN There were two.  Not one.  But two. \nANNE I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry. \nD'ARTAGNAN Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens. \nHe kisses her.  She drinks in his love.  Then he stands and moves to the door.  He looks back, then stares out. \nANNE D'Artagnan -- ? \nHe looks back once more; he seems to want to tell her something; but whatever it is, he can't find the words, and with a last loving look at her, he walks away. \nEXT.  ESTABLISHING THE BASTILLE - NIGHT \nA sudden visual, establishing the Bastille, the horrific legendary prison of Paris. \nINT.  BASTILLE - NIGHT \nPhillippe, his head covered in a burlap hood, is rushed through the twisting stairways of the prison. \nINT.  A CELL, IN THE BOWELS OF THE BASTILLE \nThe guards remove the hood, and Phillippe sees the cell. Then he sees the blacksmith there, with a new iron mask, and his eyes take on a fresh horror. \nPHILLIPPE No.  Please!  No! \nThe guards seize him and the blacksmith places the mask over Phillippe's face, as he screams.  They seal the mask with a small padlock, whose key is distinctive, and jeweled. \nINT.  BASTILLE - LATER \nThe two guards and the blacksmith are coming downstairs after completing their work.  Far above them, in the prison tower, the cries of the prisoner echo; he sounds like a raving madman now. \nThe two guards and the blacksmith enter an office at the base of the tower; the BASTILLE JAILER looks up. \nBLACKSMITH Pay me quick, I want out of here. \nSoldiers, swords drawn, appear in the doorway behind them. \nGUARDS What -- \nBASTILLE JAILER You saw the prisoner's face. \nUnderstanding, the blacksmith raises his hammer toward the soldiers; but he is stabbed in the back by the jailer, and the soldiers skewer the two guards who helped him.  A soldier lifts the jeweled key from the hand of a dead guard. \nTHE KEY \nis handed to the King by Andre, the young Lieutenant.  Louis hangs the key around his own neck, with a thin gold chain. \nLOUIS Now.  Where is d'Artagnan? \nLIEUTENANT Out directing the search for the traitors. \nLOUIS When he returns, watch him.  When he leaves again, you tell me. \nThe Lieutenant bows.  Louis smiles, and fingers the key. \nEXT.  PARIS STREETS - NIGHT \nSquads of young Musketeers gallop along the river, and through the dark streets around it, searching... \nALONG THE BACK WALL OF NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL, three forms scurry through the darkness:  Aramis, Porthos and Athos, heaving, wheezing.  They duck into a niche of the wall to avoid capture from another patrol galloping by.  Then Aramis unlocks a door in the cathedral wall and they stagger in. \nINT.  CATACOMBS \nThe three Musketeers struggle through the catacombs, reach the chapel, and fall gasping to the floor. \nARAMIS Bloody hell... \nATHOS We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place. \nPORTHOS Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite. \nARAMIS Bread and wine... in that cupboard. \nPorthos hauls himself to his feet and turns up the wick of the lantern.  The rising light reveals a note, stuck to the cupboard with the blade of a dagger. \nPORTHOS A note.  Pinned with a dagger, like the old days. \nHe removes the note, and reads... \nPORTHOS \"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan.\" \nATHOS He lures us to capture. \n", "test3_id": 1316}

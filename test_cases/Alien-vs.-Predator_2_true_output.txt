HIROKO Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk? 
PARSONS hands over a vinyl-wrapped packet. 
PARSONS Don't lose it. 
HIROKO slips it into a breast-pocket and secures the flap. 
HIROKO Don't worry.  I won't. 
DRISCOLL hands several metallic objects to HIROKO. 
DRISCOLL Here.  If you got to use 'em, make 'em count. 
They're magazines for her gun.  She slots them into the bandolier. 
HIROKO Thanks. 
PARSONS Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight. 
HIROKO Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button... 
PARSONS   (interrupting) No.  There's two of them. 
She pulls on the zip and begins locking the harness clasps into place. 
HIROKO Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons... 
PARSONS Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response. 
YORK hands over a sophisticated-looking power-tool. 
YORK You'll need this for the gratings. Trigger finger to operate, thumb button to switch over to the rivet gun.  The sensors'll choose blade or socket heads automatically. 
HIROKO Right.   (long beat)   Okay, I'm set. 
YORK and DRISCOLL lower the massive dome-fronted helmet over HIROKO's head. Auto-clasps lock into place as it brackets with the collar. PARSONS clips the slimline air-tank to her back, and DRISCOLL makes the connections. 
PARSONS Alright, let's open her up.  Carefully, now... 
CASSIE and the others hold their weapons and motion-trackers steadily at a fixed point on the ground.  Two ONLOOKERS bend down to the pressure-hatch beneath the floor-grating.  It's identical to the one DILLER and URIOSTE removed earlier.  A plume of pressurised gas jets into the air, and they pull the metal sealing-plug free.  CASSIE scrutinizes her tracker... 
CASSIE All clear... 
HIROKO reaches up to her helmet and presses a chunky button on one side. 
HIROKO's P.O.V. We're looking through the transparent bowl of the helmet at the open shaft, braken water SLOSHING around it's rim.  Superimposed lines of glowing neon appear on the visor's surface, a precisely overlaid duplication of the scene in computer-graphic form.  A flatly- synthesised male 
COMPUTER VOICE comes over the helmet speakers, O.S. 
COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers) Approaching 'A' module lower level venturiduct DS Oh-four... 
HIROKO gets down on her hands and knees and crawls towards the opening. She stares at the murky water with mounting apprehension.  Tries to reassure herself. 
HIROKO Okay.  Okay. 
She looks around at the impassive, staring faces.  Summoning up her courage, she submerges the helmet... 
HIROKO'S P.O.V. The pale illumination of the lower level deck-lights gives way to absolute nothingness; a stygian nightmare.  She SHUDDERS with horror and pulls her head free. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) Oh...!  Oh, God... 
She WIPES frenetically at the slickly-coated visor, breathing heavily. Worried hands grab her. 
CASSIE Are you alright? 
PARSONS What?  What's wrong?  What is it? 
HIROKO's eyes dart around, speaking volumes.  She swallows hard and calms down. 
HIROKO It's alright.  I'm okay. 
Steeling herself, she takes a deep breath and plunges headfirst into the water once more... 
HIROKO's P.O.V. Everything goes to blackness again.  The head-up-display presents a view of the unseen tunnel in cheerful candy-apple hues. 
COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers) Entering venturi duct, en route to secondary overflow sump DS oh four slash eleven... 
YORK watches HIROKO's feet disappear into the shaft. 
PARSONS Seal it.

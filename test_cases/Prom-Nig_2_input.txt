CUT TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
Another SCREAM, as throbbing DISCO MUSIC pulsates from a large portable RADIO sitting on a dresser. 
SUPER: APRIL 27, 1980. A young woman with long, golden brown hair and a trim figure is slipping into a pair of tight jeans. Pull- ing on a halter top, she sways to the MUSIC. 
VIVIAN (O.S.) 
(CALLS OUT) Kim! Turn that music down. You're driving me crazy! Turning around at the SOUND of her mother's VOICE, Kim Hammond reaches for the volume control Now eighteen, she is a strikingly beautiful girl with an open, innocent quality. 
KIM 
(CALLS OUT) Okay, Mom! Kim quickly finishes dressing, whirling around the room to the pounding disco rhythm. Giving her hair a few final strokes with a brush, she gazes at a photograph of a young man stuck in her mirror. On the picture is written: "To Kim, the best on the floor... dancing, that is! Love, Nick." Kim glances at another photograph stuck in her mirror. This one shows her sister, Robin, taken a few days be- fore the accident. Her sadness passes as quickly as it came. Gathering her textbooks, she switches OFF the RADIO and exits. 
8 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Raymond and Vivian Hammond are just finishing break- fast. The years have favored him; except for a touch of gray around the temples and a few extra pounds, he looks much the same way as we remember him.

8 CONTINUED: 
HAMMOND (reading the paper) I'll tell you, Vi, I'm thinking of starting up an armed robbery course at the high school.. I've got a feeling it'd be popular... He smiles at his joke, looks at her. She doesn't seem to have heard him. 
HAMMOND 
(CONTINUING) I just hope there's no trouble at the prom tonight... Kim bursts into the kitchen, interrupting her father with a kiss on the head. 
KIM 
(LAUGHS) Mmmm, sounds like fun! 
HAMMOND 
(SMILING) And how is the next queen of the Winston High Junior-Senior Prom? 
KIM Scared tiff. She leans over to kiss her mother. Vivian automatical- ly turns her cheek to Kim without looking at her. 
KIM 
(CONTINUING) Morning, Mom. We got any yogurt? 
VIVIAN 
(WITHOUT LOOKING 
AT KIM) No, dear. Fix yourself a good meal. You're getting awfully thin. Kim and her father exchange glances. He shrugs 
HAIVMOND who's your lucky escort tonight? 
KIM You know, Daddy... Nick.

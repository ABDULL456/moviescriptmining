LINDA He's close! 
INT. TUNNEL 
Matt running, checking over his shoulder. Sounds of footsteps behind him, but up ahead the heavy metal blast doors begin to close. 
MATT Goddamnit. The doors are closing. He's shutting me in. 
Matt rushes the doors as they slide shut. He doesn't make it in time. The doors close with a resounding clang. Matt turns and pulls on his thermals. 
MATT (cont'd) Where is he? 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Linda huddled over the screen. Tense. 
LINDA He's coming right at you! 
Then checks the Thermal goggles. Several heat signature dot the tunnel. 
MATT Where? 
LINDA Twenty, maybe thirty feet. 
MATT Goddamnit, I got thermals all over the place. Eight, maybe ten of them. Must be ghosts. 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Linda gets a sense of forboding. She looks around the room. Sees a heating vent in the corner. 
Beat. 
She grabs the walkie. 
LINDA Those signatures ... they're coming from the heating vents. 
Through the goggles, Matt sees the tunnel turning red. 
MATT I'm starting to lose resolution on my thermals. 
LINDA Get out of there! 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM 
FRANK If the room temperature is the same as his body temperature, thermal visors'll be no good. 
Linda grabs a Tranq gun and heads for the door. 
LINDA I'm going! 
FRANK Linda...it's not safe. 
LINDA That's why I'm going. (to Frank and Sarah) Corridor eight is clear. Get Carter to the lab. We'll meet you there. 
FRANK But... 
LINDA Do it. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Matt turns to face the corridor. It's turning red. Matt sees some movement in the thermal cloud. Opens fire. But the thermal signature disappears into the heat. Matt can't distinguish anything through his goggles anymore. He pulls them off and holds him gun in front of him sweeping the hallway. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Marco...Polo... Marco... Polo... 
His voice keeps shifting. Matt fires. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) Not even close. 
Matt sweeps his front leg back and forth, like a blind man using a cane. But his foot isn't hitting anything. He sees a FIRE EXTINGUISHER mounted on the wall. He rushes it, turns it on the hallway and sprays. And SOMETHING LUNGES through the foam. GRABS HIM, sending him tumbling down the tunnel. Matt is thrown against the wall. Blood coming from his brow. He scrambles away, spraying more foam. Sees a shape in the mist, raises his pistol and FIRES. The shape leaps away. The DART FLIES. Doesn't hit. Matt scrambles back into a corner. His pistol is empty. 
SEBASTIAN So... just out of curiosity, how long has my best friend been fucking my ex- girlfriend. 
MATT Sebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You aren't thinking rationally. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE She's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she? 
MATT Calm down, Sebastian... we can talk this through. It's not too late. 
The Shape parts the low hanging mist, the fine powder swirling in clouds behind it. Coming toward him. 
MATT (CONT'D) C'mon Sebastian. Don't do this. I'm your friend. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I'm sorry, but I just feel that our friendship is holding me back. I'm sure you understand. 
THE DOOR OPENS. Linda reaches through, grabs Matt. She pulls him to his feet and through the door.

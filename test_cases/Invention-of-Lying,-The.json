MARTHA SCHIFFMAN'S ROOM - DAY \nAn elderly woman in a light blue robe sits on the side of her bed, with her back to Mark, staring at the wall only inches from her face. \nMARK Oh Grandma, that is so depressing. Come on, at least stare at the ceiling or something. \nMark takes his grandmother by the hand and steers her to the other side of her bed. \nMARTHA The television is broken. \nMARK The television isn't broken. You probably sat on the remote and changed it to channel two again. \nMark flicks on the TV with the remote. Static fills the screen. He changes the channel and a picture comes into view. \nMARK See, you had it on the wrong channel. It needs to be on channel three in order for the satellite to work. \nMARTHA I don't understand anything you just said and that makes me scared and angry. \nMARK I can't understand what it feels like to be you so it just irritates me and makes me think you're stupid. But I also love you and wish things were better for you. \nMARTHA I do too. \nMARK Grandma, I lost my job today. I'm forty years old. I'm completely alone and I've got absolutely no prospects for anything. \nMARTHA I'm sorry, Mark. Things aren't any better for me here. I can't afford most of my medication, I'm very alone and I forget more and more every day. \nMARK I'm just so tired of life. Why does life have to be so... what's the word? Don't you sometimes wish you could change things? Don't you sometimes wish you weren't such a loser? \nMARTHA I don't think I'm a loser. \nMARK Of course you're a loser, grandma. Our family is made up of losers. We're all poor, we're all average looking, we're all only moderately intelligent, we're all lonely and unloved. \nMARTHA Well, we're poor because we weren't born with money and it's very hard to make enough money in a single lifetime to move from one social class to another. We're only moderately intelligent because there's been a lot of inbreeding in our lineage. And we're only lonely and unloved right now. Remember, I've had two husbands I loved very much in my lifetime. (MORE) \nMARTHA (cont'd) And maybe one day you'll have a wife that you love very much too. \nMARK Yeah, but I'm not talking about the past, Grandma. I'm talking about right now. And right now we're both losers, Grandma. We're both shitty, shitty losers. Don't you know that? \nMARTHA I suppose we are. But things could be worse. We could be homeless. \nMARK I'd rather be dead than be homeless. That's why I need to get out there and find a job. If I have to be homeless, I'm going to kill myself. \nMARTHA Well that's sad. I love you, Mark. Good luck finding a job! \nMARK I love you too, Grandma. \nMark leaves. As he shuts the door from the hallway he hears the channel change and turn back to static. \nMARTHA (O.S.) Oops. \nINT. BAR - AFTERNOON \nMark and his friend GREG (40'S), an even less attractive, less interesting and less intelligent version of Mark, are bellied up the bar with half empty beers in front of them. \nMARK I'll start looking for a job tomorrow. \nGREG Lately I don't like Indian people. (PAUSE) I don't like white people even more though. I fucking hate white people. I fucking hate people. \nMARK Hey, thanks for setting me up with your cousin by the way. \nGREG Third cousin. She's hot right? \nMARK Very. \nGREG Way out of your league. Dunno why you bothered. \nMARK It felt nice to go out with someone that pretty. Like for just one moment I experienced what it would be like to be the type of person someone like that would date. It felt good. Doesn't matter anyway. I will always be just who I am right now: average looking, of average intelligence with an average personality. Just a completely generic human being. \nGREG Your life is still better than mine. \nMARK By a good margin. \n", "test1_true": "GREG Lately I've been crying in my sleep and waking up in a pool of urine. \nMARK I really wish I had a better friend than you. \nGREG So, what are you going to do now? \nMARK I don't know. Guess I'll start looking for another crappy job. \nGREG Doubt you'll find one. Not much need for an out-of-work writer specializing in the Black Plague. \nMark downs his last shot. \nMARK I'm going to go now. You're seriously depressing me. I really wish I was cool enough to have a better friend than you. \nGREG I'm the best you're gonna get, man. Call me later. \nMARK Yeah. \nMark gets up and drunkenly stumbles out of the bar. \nINT. MARK'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMark drunkenly lies in bed. He picks up the phone and dials. \nJENNIFER (ON PHONE) Hello? \nMark just breathes, too scared to say anything. \nJENNIFER (ON PHONE) Hello? I can hear you breathing. Is this a rapist? \nMARK (QUICKLY) No, it's Mark. I'm sorry. \nMark hangs up quickly, embarrassed and ashamed. He sighs and turns off the light. \nFADE TO: \nTHE NEXT MORNING \nThe alarm clock goes off. \nMARK Shut the fuck up, I don't even have a job! \nMark tosses the alarm clock across the room and goes back to bed. \nLATER. \nA loud banging wakes Mark who groggily stumbles out of bed. \nINT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nMark opens the door to find his landlord, a middle aged, well- groomed man. \nLANDLORD I'm here for the rent. \nMARK I was going to come talk to you about that. I got fired yesterday. \nLANDLORD I know. That's why I'm here for the rent. \nMARK Well, I haven't got it. \nLANDLORD How much do you have? \nMARK I think I've got about three hundred dollars in my bank account. \nLANDLORD The rent is eight hundred dollars. \nMARK I know. I haven't got it. \nLANDLORD Then you're evicted. I'll help you with your things. \nA stunned Mark stands helpless as the Landlord pushes past him, grabs a lamp from his living room and carries it out into the hallway. \nLANDLORD Help me with the couch. It looks heavy. \nMark sighs and follows the Landlord back into his apartment. \nINT.

Come watch me read about the exciting events that took place during the Industrial Revolution.

Summer `07.\" \nBACK ON MARK: His eyes are wide. The wheels in his head are spinning again. \nMARK Rob Marlowe, your streak of success has finally come to an end. \nSuddenly Mark jumps and runs to his kitchen table. He grabs a pen, pulls out a sheet of paper... and begins writing. \nSERIES OF JUMP CUTS: Mark writing furiously throughout the night, piling up page upon page. By the time the sun comes up Mark is exhausted, with barely the energy to keep his head up as he writes \"the end\" and places the final page on his large stack of finished pages. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. LECTURE FILMS - CAR LOT - MORNING \nMark hustles through the parking lot, manuscript in hand. He reaches the door and then stops -- remembering something. \nMark runs to the curb and throws his manuscript onto the dirty, filthy street. He gets down on his hands and knees and rubs his manuscript into the grime, making sure to get every page equally filthy. \nSatisfied, he organizes the pages into a neat pile and enters Lecture Films. \nINT. LECTURE FILMS - WRITER'S OFFICES - DAY \nMark walks the aisles of Lecture Films. People stop to stare at him. There is a whispered hubbub from the many cubicles and offices. \nMark passes his old office, stopping to read the sign on the door: \"14TH CENTURY -- CLOSED.\" \nMark grimaces and keeps walking. \nSHELLEY (O.S.) He's gone crazy! \nMark turns his head to see Shelley, standing down the hall, terrified, staring at Mark. \nMark ignores her and keeps walking. Leaning against his door jamb, is Rob, smirking as Mark passes him. \nROB Come to beg for your old job back? Hey everybody, here's the loser who thought the Black Plague would make for an interesting film. Good luck, douche bag. Freaking loser. \nMark walks right up to the door that reads, \"Head of Development -- Anthony James.\" \nMark opens the door. \nAnthony is on the phone, his back to Mark. \nANTHONY (ON PHONE) They're going to fire me any moment, I just know it. I'm really, really horrible at my job. I don't know anything about movies. I don't even like movies. I like sports. Head of development, what does that even mean? I'm not a smart person. Okay, talk to you later. \nAnthony turns around to find Mark. His face becomes very, very scared. \nANTHONY That was the head of the studio. (PAUSE) I'm very scared that you're mad at me about the whole firing thing. \nMARK I'm not mad at all. \nAnthony is relieved. \nANTHONY Oh good, because I feel really bad about it. I mean, I would be horrible at your job too. I would be horrible at any job in this place. (PAUSE) I love sports. \nThey both stare at each other for a long beat. \nANTHONY Why are you here? \nMark pulls up a chair. \n", "test2_true": "ANTHONY I knew it. \nMARK And so I left this building and I just started walking. And I walked all the way out of town. And then I walked into the desert and I fell asleep under a tree. \nANTHONY I don't do well with other people's life changing events. \nMARK And when I woke up I found this strange old chest sticking out of the ground. So I started digging. And I unearthed a very old and ancient box. Probably, oh... about... seven hundred years old. And inside the box... (holding up manuscript) ... was this. \nMark places his muddy, dirty, manuscript down on Anthony's desk. Anthony is scared to touch it. \nANTHONY What is it? \nMARK It's a never-before-heard historical event from the past. \nANTHONY When does it take place? \nMARK The 1300's. \nThe excitement drains from Anthony's face. \nANTHONY I told you we're not interested in Black Plague movies here, Mark. \nMARK This one isn't about the black plague. Well it isn't just about the black plague. Let me read you some of this. \nAnthony rolls his eyes. \nMARK Anthony, get excited about this. This is a brand new event from history that no one has ever heard before. It's a great human discovery. \nANTHONY Yeah, but is there a movie there? \nMARK The greatest movie Lecture Films has ever made. \nAnthony's eyes widen. \nANTHONY Start reading. \nMark picks up the manuscript and opens the first page. \nMARK (READING) On the very first day of the fourteenth century, a momentous occasion occurred. It began as a day much like any other. The sun rose, the people awoke, workers began to work, babies began to cry. But all of that was interrupted when a giant flying space ship crashed down from the skies and landed in the heart of Babylon. \nAnthony's mouth drops to the ground. \nANTHONY What?! \nMark smiles. Anthony picks up his phone and presses \"intercom\". \nANTHONY (ON PHONE) I want everyone in here now! We've got a BIG ONE. \nAnthony hangs up. \nANTHONY Please, Mark. Continue. \nMARK (READING) As the smoke cleared, the door to the spaceship opened and inside, were hundreds of beautiful, half naked alien women. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThe room is filled with people now, all of them hanging on every word Mark reads from his manuscript. Even Rob and Shelly lean against the back wall, their minds blown by the story Mark is telling. \nMARK (READING) And then the ninja army unleashed a giant fireball that brought the robot dinosaur to its knees, saving Mars, Earth and the Nude Amazonian Alien Women all in one sweeping motion. The earth was saved. Jebediah and Aleena were allowed to marry by alien king Xardon. It was to be the First Human-Nude Amazonian Alien Woman wedding, and no expenses would be spared. All of Babylon and Mars were invited to join in the celebrations. \nPeople around the room wipe tears from their eyes. \nMARK (READING) The wedding was held on a brisk summers day on Mars, with all of the survivors of the Great Ninja War and the Black Plague present. They feasted and danced and laughed and it was a joyous occasion. (MORE) \nMARK (cont'd) The moment the bride and groom kissed, King Xardon performed a mind-wipe on all of the humans, thereby erasing all knowledge of these events from their minds, and sent them back to Babylon. For seven hundred years these events would be forgotten by mankind until one day, a great writer by the name of Mark Bellison, would stumble upon them in the desert, after being fired by his shit boss Anthony and mocked by Rob and Shelly, two huge douche bags. Lecture Films Motion Picture Studios would go on to make the picture and it would be a big success, and Mark would become very wealthy and famous from it. The End. \nThe entire room bursts into applause. Not just normal applause, but massive, epic applause. \nEveryone crowds around Mark, hugging him, touching him, blown away by the magnanimity of the moment. \nANTHONY Mark, tell us what it's called. \nMark thinks it over for a moment and looks right at Rob. \nMARK (to Rob) The Black Plague. \nRob sneers.

Mark holds his grandmother's hand, her hand is shaking. \nMARTHA I'm so scared, Mark. I don't want to die. You know, people don't talk about it much, but death is a horrible thing. One minute you're alive, there's a whole world around you, humming and jumping, people coming in and out, doors opening and closing, love and anger and the whole mess of it all, and then like that, it's all gone. (CRYING) This is it Mark, only a few hours left of this until an eternity of nothingness. \nThe wheels in Mark's head are spinning again. Suddenly the heart monitor starts beating rapidly and Martha lurches in pain. \nMARK Grandma! \nMark immediately slams on the big red \"call nurse\" button, holding his grandmother down as she lurches in pain. \nSeconds later three nurses burst into the room. \nNURSE #1 She's seizing. \nNurse #2 begins filling a syringe. Mark sits by his grandmother's head, they're both looking right at each other. \nMARTHA I'm scared. \nMARK Listen closely to me, Grandma. I have a surprise for you. \nWe focus on Mark and his grandmother, inches from one another as the paramedics busy themselves around Martha's dying body. \nMARK You're wrong about what happens when you die. It's not an eternity of nothingness. \nMartha is hanging on to every word Mark is saying. \nMARK When you die you're going to go to your favorite place in the whole world. And you're going to be with all of the people you've ever loved and who have ever loved you. And you're going to be young again, and you'll be able to run through the fields and dance and jump, and there will be no sadness, no pain, just love and laughing and happiness. There will be ponies made of gold, and everyone will live in giant mansions, and everything will smell like cookies. And it will last for an eternity, Grandma. An eternity. \nTears are rolling down Martha's face as a glimmering smile overtakes her face. \nMark looks up to see the nurses, paramedics and doctors all staring at Mark in total shock. \nNURSE #1 Go on. \nDOCTOR What else happens? \nThe cardiogram flat lines. \nMARK Do your jobs! \nEveryone distractedly goes back to helping the grandmother. \nMARK You're going to be happy forever, grandma. I promise you. Say hello to my mom for me. Tell her I love her. \nAgain, everyone has stopped helping Martha, they're all listening intently. Some of them are crying. \nNURSE #2 (TEARFULLY) I'm going to see my mother again when I die. \nDOCTOR Tell us more, please. \nMartha stops breathing. The machine flatlines.

A massive crowd of people are leaving their cars and walking. \nMark gets out of his car to find a wild scene: hundreds of people camped out on the lawn of his apartment building. \nStanding by his door is the NURSE from the hospital. She immediately points at Mark and screams. \nNURSE #1 There he is! \nMark is bum-rushed by a question-asking throng. All of them are pelting Mark with questions, all of them confused and hopeful and desperately looking for answers. \nPERSON #1 Is there only one place you go when you die? \nPERSON #2 Will everyone who has ever died be there? \nPERSON #3 What's this place called? \nPERSON #4 Will I get to have sex with people there? \nMark pushes through the crowd, overwhelmed by it all. He gets to his door and opens it, only to have the Nurse step in his path and block the door. \nNURSE #1 You owe us an explanation. If you know something this important, you better tell us all. \nMARK Who are you people? \nNURSE #1 The words you spoke last night, to your grandmother, spread like wildfire. Please, tell us more.

MARK'S APARTMENT - DAY \nMark goes to his fridge and pulls out a beer. His mind is reeling. As he opens a drawer to get a bottle opener he sees the letter: \"MY INVENTION\".

Well now I know I did something bad. \nJENNIFER They're saying that you know something different about what happens after you die. \nMark walks into his bedroom and turns on the TV.

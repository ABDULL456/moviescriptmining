{"train": "THE INVENTION OF LYING \nWritten by \nRicky Gervais & Matthew Robinson \nJune 8, 2007 \nEXT. CAVEMAN VILLAGE - THE PALEOLITHIC ERA - DAY \nA small caveman community made up of five large caves, all facing out towards a crackling fire. \nSlack-jawed, yet strong and confident CAVEMEN stumble about, dragging haunches of meat, pounding the dirt with sticks, dragging the women. \nWE PAN OVER to a small cave. Not even really a cave at all, but a crack in the rocks barely large enough to sleep in. Stepping out of this \"cave\" is a small, weak, nerdy-looking caveman. \nThe chief caveman, set apart by the large mallet he wields, steps towards the fire and grunts loudly to mark the beginning of a caveman meeting. \n\"Loser caveman\" steps forward apprehensively, only to be met with laughter from the other cavemen. \"Loser caveman\" sighs and shrinks back into his sad, little cave, watching them from the shadows. \nCHIEF CAVEMAN (grunting; subtitled) Me see beast today. Beast scary. Beast danger for caveman. \nThe rest of the cavemen look nervous. \nCHIEF CAVEMAN If caveman kill beast? Caveman safe. Caveman have food. \nThe cavemen grunt in understanding. \nCHIEF CAVEMAN Who kill beast? \nThe cavemen grunt amongst themselves. The toughest of the bunch steps forward, pounds his chest and grunts. \nCHIEF CAVEMAN Grob kill beast. Good Grob. \nThe chief notices \"loser caveman\" watching from a distance. \nCHIEF CAVEMAN Loser want kill beast? \nAll the cavemen turn and laugh at the \"loser caveman\". \nCHIEF CAVEMAN Loser kill nothing! \nAll the cavemen laugh hysterically. \nCAVEMAN #1 Look at Loser cave! So small! \nCAVEMAN #2 Loser dumb! \nCAVEMAN #3 Fuck that guy! \nAll the cavemen pick up rocks and begin throwing them at the \"loser caveman\", who dives out of his cave and runs around the camp, dodging their blows. \nEXT. CAVEMAN VILLAGE - THE PALEOLITHIC ERA - NIGHT \nEveryone in the village is asleep. Everyone, that is, but \"loser caveman\" who sleeps uncomfortably in his tiny little cave, tossing and turning, unable to get comfortable. \nA stirring in the trees causes \"loser caveman\" to sit upright. There's something outside of the village. Something big. \nSuddenly a GIANT TUSKED BOAR pushes through the trees and stands, looking quite menacing, not ten yards from the village fire. \n\"Loser caveman\" is practically shaking with fear. The boar makes eye-contact with \"loser caveman\" and charges directly towards his tiny little cave. \nThe giant boar runs head first into the cave opening, but the opening is too small for the beast to fit its head inside. \"Loser caveman\" screams like a girl. \nThe boar backs up to strike again -- this one sure to be the end of \"loser caveman\" -- when a large boulder, knocked loose by the Boar's first hit, tumbles down and lands smack on the Boar's head, killing it instantly. \nThe entire village runs out to see what has happened. The \"Loser caveman\" stumbles out of the cave and dusts himself off. \nThe chief steps forward. \nCHIEF CAVEMAN The beast! It dead! \nCAVEMAN #2 Hey, look at loser! He almost die! Look he scared! \nEveryone laughs. The Chief looks towards Loser, standing nervously near the corpse of the Giant Tusked Boar. \nCHIEF CAVEMAN Loser, what happen? \nLOSER CAVEMAN (SHAMEFULLY) The Beast, it came at me. It smash my cave. \nMARK I hope this date ends in sex. \nJENNIFER Not me. I don't find you attractive. Come on in. \nMark enters. \nROLL CREDITS \nJennifer's apartment is new-adult, as if she just found out she was an adult yet hasn't had the time or the money to complete the transition. \nJENNIFER I need to finish getting ready. While doing that I might realize I'm still horny and try to finish masturbating without you hearing. \nJennifer heads towards the bathroom. Mark stands alone in her living room, looking around. \nMARK (shouting to her) I feel awkward and I regret being early. \nJENNIFER (O.S.) (shouting back) Yeah, I'm disappointed you're early and not really looking forward to tonight in general, but the thought of being alone the rest of my life scares both my mother and I equally. \nIt's completely silent for a long beat. Mark looks around, then sits on her couch. \nMARK (shouting to her) I have an erection now because I assume you began masturbating once we stopped talking. \nMore silence. \nMARK (shouting to her) I'm embarrassed because I think the restaurant I've made reservations at might not be expensive enough or hip enough to impress you, but it was the best I could do because I don't make very much money. You see, I'm forty years old and have no real financial assets to speak of, I've never owned a home, and never had a significant relationship. My boss even told me today that I'm most likely going to get fired tomorrow and... \nJennifer enters the room and Mark stops talking. \nJENNIFER I just masturbated. \nMARK That makes me very horny. \nJENNIFER Shall we go? \nMARK Sure. \nMark stands up. Jennifer picks up her purse and opens the door. \nJENNIFER After you. \nEND CREDITS \nINT. MARK'S VOLVO - NIGHT \nMark and Jennifer drive in silence for a beat. \nJENNIFER I'm only doing this as a favor for my cousin Greg. He keeps begging me to go out on a date with you. He says you're funny. \nMARK Greg's a good friend. \nJENNIFER Where are we eating tonight? \nMARK A cute little place called La Bonisera in West Hollywood. \nJENNIFER You obviously don't have very much money but that's not necessarily a deal breaker. \nMARK I have very little money. \nJENNIFER I also don't really care about a guy who knows all the latest, hippest restaurants. \nMARK I don't know any of them. \nJENNIFER In fact, there are very few things in life that I care about all that much. The only things I have to offer myself or anyone else are my good looks and my affected sense of quirkiness which artistically inclined men interpret as intellect. (MORE) \nJENNIFER (cont'd) In fact, I think my best trait is the fact that I've made very few mistakes: socially, academically, financially or romantically. I take very few risks and therefore lead a relatively happy and light-hearted existence. Mostly though, I'm a kind, sweet person with the potential of genuinely becoming a vital and interesting human being the day I take the energy I expend on hyper self-reflexivity and apply it to actual action in the reality of my life. \nMARK I found that boring and started thinking about this place's fish tacos. \nINT. LA BONISERA - NIGHT \nThe Volvo pulls up in front of the restaurant and the valet parking guy opens Jennifer's door. \nVALET PARKING GUY I'm extremely bored. \nJENNIFER Hello. \nThe valet parking guy hands Mark a ticket. \nINT. LA BONISERA - NIGHT \nThe waiter returns with their drinks. \nWAITER (hands beer to Mark) Here you go. (hands drink to Jennifer) I had a sip of this. \nJENNIFER Okay. \nWAITER Do you guys know what you want or do you need a moment? \nMARK I'm ready. \nJENNIFER I'll have a caesar salad with chicken because I think I'm fat but I also think I deserve something that tastes good. \nMARK I'll have the fish taco's because I had them once here and it's all I know. \nWAITER Excellent, I'll get those both started for you. \nThe waiter leaves. Jennifer's cell phone rings from inside her purse. \nJENNIFER Sorry, one second. \nShe pulls out her cell phone and checks it. \nJENNIFER It's my mother, this won't take long. Probably checking in on our date. \nJennifer answers the phone. She talks openly and in plain view of Mark. \nJENNIFER (ON PHONE) Hello? Yes, I'm with him right now. No, not very attractive. No, doesn't make much money. He's all right though. Seems nice. Kind of funny. A bit fat. Funny little snub nose. No, I won't be sleeping with him tonight. Nope, probably not even a kiss. Okay, you too. Bye. \nJennifer hangs up. \nJENNIFER Sorry about that. \nMARK Don't think twice. How is your mom? \nJENNIFER She's all right. \nMARK Fantastic. \nTIME CUT: LATER THAT NIGHT \nBoth of their plates are now empty. Three empty Margarita glasses sit in front of Jennifer. \nThe waiter approaches with the bill and places it down in the middle of the table. \nWAITER (to Jennifer) If I give you my number will you call me? \nJENNIFER No. \nEXT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT \nMark walks Jennifer to the front door of her apartment complex. \nMARK Thanks for going on this date with me. You're way, way out of my league and I know you were just doing it as a favor to Greg, and that most likely I'll never hear from you again. \nJENNIFER I actually had a better time than I thought I'd have, but I won't know for sure how I feel about you until I'm less drunk. \nMARK Give me a call if you still like me once you're sober. \nJENNIFER I might. \nMark leans in for a kiss. Jennifer kisses him on the cheek and goes inside. \nMARK Thanks for kissing me on the cheek, I know you didn't have to do that and.... \nJennifer waves and heads inside. \nMARK (shouting after her) ... you're very pretty. Thank you! \nINT. MARK'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMark plops into bed in his boxers. His bedroom is bland, uninspired and completely furnished by the cheapest stuff found in an IKEA catalogue. \nMark flips on the TV and gets under the covers. A commercial comes on TV. \nINSERT: COMMERCIAL \nA man in a suit stands next to a single can of coke resting on a small table. \nJIM Hi, I'm Jim and I'm the spokesperson for the Coca-Cola company. I'm here today to ask you to continue buying coke. I'm sure it's a drink you've been drinking for years, and if you still enjoy it, I'd like to remind you to buy it again sometime soon. It's basically just brown sugar water, we haven't changed the ingredients much lately, so there's nothing new about it I can say. We changed the can around a little bit. See, the colors here are a little different, and we even put a polar bear on it for the kids. Also, coke is very high in sugar, can lead to obesity in children and adults who don't sustain a healthy diet, and has a Ph acidity level high enough to dissolve teeth and bones over extended periods of time. Coke also works great at removing corrosion from car batteries and loosening rusted bolts. So that's it, it's coke. Everyone knows it. It's very famous. I'm Jim, I work for coke, and I'm asking you to not stop buying coke. That's all. Thanks. \nANGLE ON: TV SCREEN. A black screen. \nNARRATOR Coming this summer from Lecture Films Motion Picture Studios. Written by Oscar winning screenwriter Rob Marlowe. \nINTERCUT Mark scowling at this name. \nNARRATOR (O.S.) And starring Oscar winning Reader Nathan Goldfrappe, comes the epic sequel to last year's most talked about film: \"Napoleon 1810 to 1811\". Prepare for the adventure. \nThe black fades to NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE, a middle-aged austere man sitting before a fire in a velvet smoking jacket, holding a script. \nNATHAN GOLDFRAPPE (READING) And so Napoleon invaded Russia with a brute force of nearly seven hundred thousand men behind him armed with muskets and supported by canon brigades. \nNARRATOR (O.S.) Learn of his defeat. \nNATHAN GOLDFRAPPE (READING) Through the devastating snow they marched, crippled by disease and hunger, Napoleon's men marched on. \nNARRATOR (O.S.) Listen to his redemption. \nINTERCUT the tour, enraptured by this trailer. A few of the tourists whisper to each other. \nTOURIST #1 I love these films. Saves me reading the book. \nINTERCUT the trailer title slamming onto the screen: \nNARRATOR Napoleon 1812 to 1813. Coming this summer from Lecture Films. \nThe trailer ends and the tour applauds. The tour guide turns to find Mark walking away. \nTOUR GUIDE Look everyone, there goes Mark Bellison, one of Lecture Films very own screenwriters! \nThe whole tour turns towards Mark. Mark turns around and dejectedly waves. \nTOUR GUIDE He's one of our least successful writers here at Lecture Films. (PAUSE) I also hear he's most likely getting fired today. \nThe tour nods at Mark. Mark nods back. \nTOUR GUIDE Now let's head to editing bay where we can watch.... \nINT. LECTURE FILMS - WRITER'S OFFICES - MORNING \nMark walks past cubicle after cubicle until he comes to his office and SHELLEY, his attractive late-20's receptionist. \nMARK Hi Shelley. I'm still attracted to you today. \nSHELLEY Hi Mark. Everyday I realize more and more how over-qualified I am for this position and how incompetent you are at yours. \nMARK Any messages? \nSHELLEY Anthony's coming by within the hour to see if he can work up the courage to fire you. If he can't, he said he'll definitely do it tomorrow. \nMARK Nobody else called? No calls to do with actual work? \nSHELLEY Well, I told everybody you were getting fired this week and not to expect their calls returned, so no one left any messages. \nMARK Next time I'd rather you took down the messages just in case I don't get fired. \nSHELLEY You're almost definitely getting fired. \nMARK Well, it hasn't happened yet. \nSHELLEY Okay, but everybody knows you are. \nMARK Okay, I'll be in my office. \nSHELLEY Okay, I'll be searching for new jobs on Craigslist. \nINT. LECTURE FILMS - MARK'S OFFICE - MORNING \nMark's office is completely boring and unremarkable, much like his apartment. \nThere's a knock on his door. \nANTHONY enters, looking very much the boss in his expensive suit, yet nervous and fearful as well. \nANTHONY Wow, you look really depressed today. That's going to make this so much harder. \nMARK Anthony, don't fire me. \nAnthony sits down on the other side of Mark's desk and leans forward. \nELDERLY PERSON #1 You look like my dead son. \nELDERLY PERSON #3 Life gets worse with each passing minute. \nELDERLY PERSON #4 I'm on pills that make everything orange. \nMark opens a door and enters. \nINT. MARTHA SCHIFFMAN'S ROOM - DAY \nAn elderly woman in a light blue robe sits on the side of her bed, with her back to Mark, staring at the wall only inches from her face. \nMARK Oh Grandma, that is so depressing. Come on, at least stare at the ceiling or something. \nMark takes his grandmother by the hand and steers her to the other side of her bed. \nMARTHA The television is broken. \nMARK The television isn't broken. You probably sat on the remote and changed it to channel two again. \nMark flicks on the TV with the remote. Static fills the screen. He changes the channel and a picture comes into view. \nMARK See, you had it on the wrong channel. It needs to be on channel three in order for the satellite to work. \nMARTHA I don't understand anything you just said and that makes me scared and angry. \nMARK I can't understand what it feels like to be you so it just irritates me and makes me think you're stupid. But I also love you and wish things were better for you. \nMARTHA I do too. \nMARK Grandma, I lost my job today. I'm forty years old. I'm completely alone and I've got absolutely no prospects for anything. \nMARTHA I'm sorry, Mark. Things aren't any better for me here. I can't afford most of my medication, I'm very alone and I forget more and more every day. \nMARK I'm just so tired of life. Why does life have to be so... what's the word? Don't you sometimes wish you could change things? Don't you sometimes wish you weren't such a loser? \nMARTHA I don't think I'm a loser. \nMARK Of course you're a loser, grandma. Our family is made up of losers. We're all poor, we're all average looking, we're all only moderately intelligent, we're all lonely and unloved. \nMARTHA Well, we're poor because we weren't born with money and it's very hard to make enough money in a single lifetime to move from one social class to another. We're only moderately intelligent because there's been a lot of inbreeding in our lineage. And we're only lonely and unloved right now. Remember, I've had two husbands I loved very much in my lifetime. (MORE) \nMARTHA (cont'd) And maybe one day you'll have a wife that you love very much too. \nMARK Yeah, but I'm not talking about the past, Grandma. I'm talking about right now. And right now we're both losers, Grandma. We're both shitty, shitty losers. Don't you know that? \nMARTHA I suppose we are. But things could be worse. We could be homeless. \nMARK I'd rather be dead than be homeless. That's why I need to get out there and find a job. If I have to be homeless, I'm going to kill myself. \nMARTHA Well that's sad. I love you, Mark. Good luck finding a job! \nMARK I love you too, Grandma. \nMark leaves. As he shuts the door from the hallway he hears the channel change and turn back to static. \nMARTHA (O.S.) Oops. \nINT. BAR - AFTERNOON \nMark and his friend GREG (40'S), an even less attractive, less interesting and less intelligent version of Mark, are bellied up the bar with half empty beers in front of them. \nMARK I'll start looking for a job tomorrow. \nGREG Lately I don't like Indian people. (PAUSE) I don't like white people even more though. I fucking hate white people. I fucking hate people. \nMARK Hey, thanks for setting me up with your cousin by the way. \nGREG Third cousin. She's hot right? \nMARK Very. \nGREG Way out of your league. Dunno why you bothered. \nMARK It felt nice to go out with someone that pretty. Like for just one moment I experienced what it would be like to be the type of person someone like that would date. It felt good. Doesn't matter anyway. I will always be just who I am right now: average looking, of average intelligence with an average personality. Just a completely generic human being. \nGREG Your life is still better than mine. \nMARK By a good margin. \nLANDLORD You have one day to get your things out of this hallway. \nMARK How am I supposed to do that? \nLANDLORD You've got three hundred dollars. Rent a truck. \nMARK Oh, fuck me. \nMark grits his teeth in rage. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nMark steps up to the female teller at the bank. Mark is at the lowest point in his entire life. \nBANK TELLER How can I help you today? \nMARK I'd like to make a withdrawal. \nBANK TELLER Okay, sir. I'm confident I can help you with that. \nMARK I've just been evicted from my apartment so I need to withdraw what I have left in my account so I can move my things out. I guess I need to close out my account to do that. (PAUSE) I think I'm about to be homeless. \nCLOSE ON MARK: This sinks in. \nBANK TELLER Unfortunately sir the system is down right now so I'm not going to be able to perform an account closure until the system is back up. But I can assist you in a withdrawal. How much would you like to withdraw? \nMARK Well, I'd like to withdraw eight hundred dollars. \nThe bank teller smiles at Mark. \nBANK TELLER How much are you going to withdraw today, sir? \nMARK All of it. Just whatever is left. \nBANK TELLER The system is down, sir. Please tell me how much you have in your account? \nAt the peak of his despair something suddenly comes over Mark. His face turns a light shade of red as the wheels begin to spin in his brain. He is fighting something within. \nWE FLY into Mark's skull, traveling through his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his brain. Sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession. \nThere is a small explosion. \nWe fly back out of Mark's skull -- his eyes are locked on the Bank Teller's like a deer in the headlights. \nBANK TELLER Sir? \nMARK (awkwardly fast) Eight hundred dollars. \nBANK TELLER Pardon me? \nMARK (more confident) I have eight hundred dollars in my bank account. \nThe teller locks eyes with Mark... then looks towards her computer. \nBANK TELLER Wait a second here. The system just came back up. (to co-worker) System seems to be back up, guys. (to Mark) Just one second while I access your account. You said you're withdrawing eight hundred, correct? \nMark breaks out in a cold sweat. \nMARK Yup. \nThe bank teller types on her keyboard. \nBANK TELLER Well, look at this. It says here you've only got three hundred dollars in your account. But you said you wanted to withdraw eight hundred? \nMark doesn't know what to say. He tries to speak but nothing comes out. \nBANK TELLER I apologize for this sir, but it seems our system has made a mistake. Hold on one second while I go and get your eight hundred dollars. Did you want that in large or small bills? \nMark gulps. \nMARK Large bills. \nThe teller walks away. Mark looks around nervously, awkwardly smiling at the other tellers. \nBANK TELLER (to co-worker) Guys the computers seem to be a bit buggy. Will someone call James to come in and look into it, please? \nMoments later the Bank Teller returns and begins counting out eight hundred dollars for Mark. Mark stares at the money with wide eyes. \nBANK TELLER There you are. Eight hundred dollars. Anything else I can do for you today? \nBLONDE WE'RE GOING TO LIVE! We're going to live! Thank you! Thank you! \nThe blonde falls onto the bed in exhaustion. \nBLONDE This has been the worst... and the best... day of my life. \nMARK Okay, I gotta go. \nBLONDE Oh no, please stay. We've been through so much together. \nMark stares at this helpless girl for a moment. \nMARK I'm an asshole. \nThe blonde's face and mood do an instant 180. \nBLONDE (SPITEFUL) Well, I hate assholes. Get out of here. \nThe blonde chucks her shoes at Mark as he closes the door. \nEXT. MOTEL -- DAY \nMark walks across the parking lot. A look of total shock on his face. \nINT. BAR - DUSK \nGreg is in the exact same position Mark left him in, but he's twice as drunk. \nMark plops down next to him, dazed and upset. \nMARK That was one of the worst experiences of my life. \nGREG (SHIT-FACED) Did you invent a new kind of bike? \nMARK What else would you do if you could do anything in the world? \nGREG Bone chicks asses. That's what I'd do. \nMARK What else though. What's the second thing you'd do. \nGreg nods off. Mark nudges him. \nGREG What else would you do, dipshit? \nMARK I'd get money. I'd get all the money. \nGreg passes out. Mark nods his head, takes the three full shots sitting in front of Greg and does them all. \nMARK Yeah. Let's do that. Greg, let's go. \nGREG What? \nMARK We're going on a trip. \nGreg immediately perks up. \nGREG I'll drive. \nINT. MARK'S CAR -- NIGHT \nGreg is driving, Mark rides shotgun, both of them are completely plastered. \nMARK Thanks for driving man, I'm completely plastered. \nGREG I'm just as hammered as you. But I don't care if I get arrested. I'm trying to hit bottom. \nWHOOP-WHOOP come the flashing lights of a cop car right behind them. Greg begins to pull over. \nGREG Here comes bottom. \nMark looks worried. The cop comes to Greg's window. \nCOP Nothing safer than pulling over two nerdy white guys in their forties. \nGREG I don't want to go to jail. \nCOP Are you drunk? \nGREG Yes. \nThe CHIP WOMAN looks at his money. \nCHIP WOMAN There's a very good chance you'll lose all this money here tonight. \nMARK I know. \nCHIP WOMAN And even if you do happen to win, there's an even better chance that in the long run we'll win it back. \nMARK I know. \nCHIP WOMAN Some of the games are fixed. Like all the ones that use computers. \nMARK I know. \nThe woman slides him a short stack of chips. Greg frowns. Mark and Greg walk towards the tables. \nMark and Greg look around. A cocktail waitress approaches. \nCOCKTAIL WAITRESS If I could be a stripper I would, but I'm not attractive enough. Drinks, guys? \nGREG No. I have a stomach flu. \nMARK We'll both have beers and we'll take them at that roulette table over there. \nMark points to a table and walks away. The waitress nods. \nGREG Oh come on, roulette is the stupidest game of them all. It's pure chance, no skill whatsoever. \nMARK It's okay. I'm feeling lucky. \nGREG You've never had a lucky day in your life. \nMARK Just watch. \nThey arrive at the roulette table. \nROULETTE DEALER Get your bets in, get your bets in. The house always wins in the long run. Because of the zero's on the board every bet is slightly favored towards the house. \nMark puts his chips down on seventeen black. The dealer starts the wheel. The ball comes to a stop on twenty-seven red. \nROULETTE DEALER Twenty-seven red. No one wins. \nIn full view, Mark slides his chips over to twenty-seven red. \nMARK I'm on twenty-seven red. \nThe dealer looks at this. His brain takes a moment to respond. \nROULETTE DEALER We have a winner. Congratulations, sir. \nThe dealer stacks up Mark's new chips and pushes them over to him. \nGREG You did it. You just, like, quadrupled your money. You lucky son of a bitch. \nMARK That's nothing. Watch this. \nMark puts all of his chips on double zero. A bunch of other people scatter their chips around the table as well. \nROULETTE DEALER Get your bets in, get your bets in. The house always wins in the long run. Fork over your money right here folks. I say this so often I want to kill myself. \nThe dealer spins the ball. It comes to a halt on nine black. \nROULETTE DEALER Nine black. No winners. \nMark takes ALL of the chips on the table, both his and EVERYONE ELSE'S and slides them together into a giant pile and sits them right on nine black. \nMARK I'm on nine black. These are all mine. \nThe table cheers for Mark. Some people are a bit confused, and a slight hubbub arises in the background: \"I thought I had chips on the table.\" \"Yeah, me too.\" \"We must be drunk.\" \"That guys is lucky!\" Even the dealer looks a bit confused... but gets over it quickly. \nROULETTE DEALER Nine black wins. Big winner. Congratulations, sir. \nThe roulette dealer slides about five grand in chips over to Mark. Greg's jaw is on the floor. \nGREG Do it again. \nMark notices the confused people around him. \nMARK I don't think I should. Lets go play slots. \nMARK Hey there, Frank. \nFRANK Mark. How's it going? \nMARK Pretty good, thanks. \nFrank stops and turns around, this is a different response. \nFRANK Really? \nMARK Yeah. You? \nFRANK Awful. I was doing some internet research last night about suffocation suicide. I'm probably going to give that a try tonight. \nMARK Oh. (PAUSE) All right. Bye, Frank. \nFRANK Bye. \nMark gets in the elevator, Frank walks away. A short beat. Mark exits the elevator and yells after Frank. \nMARK Frank! \nFrank, halfway out the building, turns around. \nFRANK Yeah? \nMARK Don't do it. \nFrank thinks this over. \nFRANK Why not? I'm miserable. And no one will care. \nMARK I'll care. \nFRANK You're a loser, though. \nMARK Don't do it, Frank. Things are going to be all right. \nFRANK They are? \nMARK Yes. You're going to meet someone soon. You won't be so lonely. Things are going to turn around at your job. \nFRANK My job's actually fine. \nMARK Well, things are going to get better. Better than they are. \nFRANK What about the depression? \nMARK It will go away very soon. You're going to be happy soon, Frank. You just need to wait for it. Listen to me: you don't need to kill yourself. \nSomething changes in Frank. A slight smile comes over him. \nFRANK Really? \nMARK Really. \nFrank laughs. \nFRANK Wow. Man, and that suffocation thing really seemed like a good idea. \nMARK It wasn't. \nFRANK Okay. Well, my night's open now. You want to hang out later? \nMARK I don't know. Not really. \nFrank's smile fades a tiny bit. \nMARK Sure. Of course. Let's hang out. \nFRANK I'll see you after work. \nMARK Great. \nMark gets back in the elevator to the sound of Frank laughing to himself as he exits the building. We hold on Mark for a moment as he smiles and nods his head. \nINT. MARK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMark sits at kitchen table, pen and paper in hand. \nMARK Yeah, no I was being... (pause; searching) ...there's no word for it. See you tomorrow night. \nJENNIFER Bye. \nMark hangs up happily. \nMOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V) In Our World.... in the 1800's... \nPAN ON TV: The screen is all black. \nMOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V) ... came the greatest revolution of them all. (climactic music) The Industrial Revolution. \nThe black fades to ANGELO BADSMITH, a middle-aged African American man sitting before a fire in a green smoking jacket, holding a script. \nMOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V) Written by famed screenwriter Rob Marlowe and read by Oscar winning Reader Angelo Badsmith. \nANGELO BADSMITH Hello, I'm Angelo Badmsith. Come watch me read about the exciting events that took place during the Industrial Revolution. (MORE) \nANGELO BADSMITH (cont'd) Also, I will tell you all about my personal misfortunes, such as my wife who cheated on me with a man named Perry. \nThe screen reads: \"The Industrial Revolution. Summer `07.\" \nBACK ON MARK: His eyes are wide. The wheels in his head are spinning again. \nMARK Rob Marlowe, your streak of success has finally come to an end. \nSuddenly Mark jumps and runs to his kitchen table. He grabs a pen, pulls out a sheet of paper... and begins writing. \nSERIES OF JUMP CUTS: Mark writing furiously throughout the night, piling up page upon page. By the time the sun comes up Mark is exhausted, with barely the energy to keep his head up as he writes \"the end\" and places the final page on his large stack of finished pages. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. LECTURE FILMS - CAR LOT - MORNING \nMark hustles through the parking lot, manuscript in hand. He reaches the door and then stops -- remembering something. \nMark runs to the curb and throws his manuscript onto the dirty, filthy street. He gets down on his hands and knees and rubs his manuscript into the grime, making sure to get every page equally filthy. \nSatisfied, he organizes the pages into a neat pile and enters Lecture Films. \nINT. LECTURE FILMS - WRITER'S OFFICES - DAY \nMark walks the aisles of Lecture Films. People stop to stare at him. There is a whispered hubbub from the many cubicles and offices. \nMark passes his old office, stopping to read the sign on the door: \"14TH CENTURY -- CLOSED.\" \nMark grimaces and keeps walking. \nSHELLEY (O.S.) He's gone crazy! \nMark turns his head to see Shelley, standing down the hall, terrified, staring at Mark. \nMark ignores her and keeps walking. Leaning against his door jamb, is Rob, smirking as Mark passes him. \nROB Come to beg for your old job back? Hey everybody, here's the loser who thought the Black Plague would make for an interesting film. Good luck, douche bag. Freaking loser. \nMark walks right up to the door that reads, \"Head of Development -- Anthony James.\" \nMark opens the door. \nAnthony is on the phone, his back to Mark. \nANTHONY (ON PHONE) They're going to fire me any moment, I just know it. I'm really, really horrible at my job. I don't know anything about movies. I don't even like movies. I like sports. Head of development, what does that even mean? I'm not a smart person. Okay, talk to you later. \nAnthony turns around to find Mark. His face becomes very, very scared. \nANTHONY That was the head of the studio. (PAUSE) I'm very scared that you're mad at me about the whole firing thing. \nMARK I'm not mad at all. \nAnthony is relieved. \nANTHONY Oh good, because I feel really bad about it. I mean, I would be horrible at your job too. I would be horrible at any job in this place. (PAUSE) I love sports. \nThey both stare at each other for a long beat. \nANTHONY Why are you here? \nMark pulls up a chair. \nMark and Jennifer sit at a candlelit table in the corner of a hip and fancy restaurant. Jennifer looks beautiful. Mark is on cloud nine. \nJENNIFER Congratulations on selling your script today. \nMARK Thanks. Thank you for having dinner with me. \nJENNIFER Everyone needs to eat. (PAUSE) And I enjoy your company. \nMark smiles. They both sip their drinks and look at their menus. The waiter comes up. \nWAITER I'm an extremely important waiter. (PAUSE) What can I get you? \nMARK I don't want to know what it is, I just want to order the most expensive thing on the menu. \nJENNIFER I'll have the duck. And I think you look like a little rat faced man. \nWAITER Okay, I'll have those right up for you. \nThe waiter leaves. Mark and Jennifer stare at each other for a short beat. Something has changed between them and they can both feel it. \nJENNIFER Things seem to be turning around for you. \nMARK Today is the best day of my life. Hands down. Easy. Best day. \nJENNIFER It's not every day you unearth a monumental historical event and sell it for a ton of money. \nMARK That wasn't the best part. It was great, but it wasn't the peak of my day. (PAUSE) I've had a crush on you ever since I saw a picture of you on Greg's refrigerator two years ago. \nJENNIFER Oh. \nMARK The best part of my day today is right now, sitting at this table here with you. \nJENNIFER Oh. \nMARK You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life, and you're special... and it makes me happy to be around you. \nJENNIFER Thank you. \nJennifer is touched...but she doesn't reciprocate Mark's feelings. Jennifer moves on. \nJENNIFER Tell me something about your family. I really don't know much about you. \nMARK Ah, my family. We're what you'd probably call \"not lucky\". My whole family is kind of marked by tragedy, bad luck and general... shittiness. It goes back a long ways and could probably drive someone to suicide just hearing about it, so I'll keep it simple. My mom died when I was six. Cancer. \nJENNIFER Sad. \nMARK And my dad got real depressed and lost his job. Out of work and with a kid to raise he had no choice but to turn to a life of crime. \nJENNIFER What kind of crime? \nMARK He was a robber. Houses mostly. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY \nNice, mid-to-upper class home. Lots of white wood. The house is very quiet, until... the phone rings and the answer machine picks up. \nMARK'S DAD (O.S.) (on answer machine) Hi, I'm calling to let you know I'll be robbing your house today. I'll probably be there within the hour. (PAUSE) I hope you're not there. \nThe message ends. PAN OVER to a SOCCER MOM standing in the doorway. She drops her coffee and screams. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nMARK He was a very unlucky man. He spent his last days behind bars. I never really knew him. (sad moment; pause) But I guess I've also had a little luck in my life. I did have a wonderful grandmother who raised me. \nJENNIFER Oh, that's sweet. \nMARK Yeah, she's great. \nJENNIFER Where is she? \nMARK Old person's home obviously. Who wants to live with that? Gross. \nJENNIFER I know, right? \nMARK But I'm going to get her out of there tomorrow. (MORE) \nJennifer pushes through the throng of people, which is now even larger than before. As she reaches the door Mark opens it for her and slides her through. \nMARK Come up quick, they look like they could get out of hand any second. \nMark hurries Jennifer into the elevator. \nINT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nJennifer sits on the couch while Mark, agitated beyond recognition, paces the room. \nJENNIFER Just tell me what you told your grandmother. \nMARK I don't think I should. Who knows what could happen next? I'm just going to keep my mouth shut from now on. \nJENNIFER What you said obviously affected a lot of people. I don't think you have the choice to keep it in now. \nMARK Sure I do. I could just walk out that door and get on a plane and go to Namibia. No one knows me in Namibia. \nJENNIFER Just tell me what you said. Please, Mark. \nMARK My grandmother was dying, and she was terrified, shaking all over. She didn't want to just become nothingness. So I told her that when she died there wouldn't be nothingness. That she would be with all of the people she loved who had died and that she would live an eternity of joy and happiness. \nJennifer's heart skips a beat. \nJENNIFER (barely able to speak) How do you know these things? \nMark sighs and looks out the window. The crowd extends down the block, all of them sitting calmly on his lawn, talking quietly to each other, trying to make sense of it all. \nJennifer gets up and stands beside Mark. \nJENNIFER You have to tell them everything you know. This is too big. You have no choice. \nMARK But you don't understand. The words I said... they weren't... it's not right. \nJENNIFER How did your grandmother feel when you told her these things? \nMARK Happy. At peace. \nJENNIFER And how did that make you feel? \nMARK Good. \nJENNIFER (sweeping her hand over the crowd) Think how good it will feel to do the same for all of these people. \nMark thinks this over. \nMARK Okay. But I need a few hours to get my thoughts together. \nJENNIFER I'll go tell them. \nMARK Wait! Are you sure this is right? \nJENNIFER Of course it is. You know something that's going to change mankind forever. It's the most important thing the world has ever heard. \nJennifer leaves the room. Mark, alone with his thoughts, sits down at his kitchen table, pulls out a few sheets of paper, grabs a pen and starts writing. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MARK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nMark's neighborhood is a sea of candles. The crowd has grown beyond measure. A massive sea of people, all holding candles, all waiting quietly like serene cows for Mark to come down and make his announcement. \nINT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMark is hunched over his table writing. There's a knock at the front door. Greg walks in with a large pizza and beer. \nGREG I brought pizza. How come you never told me we all get mansions? \nMARK I didn't... \nJennifer comes out of the bedroom and quickly \"shhh's\" Greg. \nGREG Inventing the bicycle is one thing, but this... \nJENNIFER Shut up. Let him work. \nJennifer pulls Greg away from Mark. Mark goes back to work. \nTIME CUT: LATER \nMARK (making it up as he goes) He's a new ethnicity. It's like a mix of all of our ethnicities. \nMAN #2 Does he live on a cloud? \nMAN #3 Can we see him? \nMARK (becoming confident) No. He lives much higher than the clouds, too high to see. \nWOMAN #2 So he lives in space? \nMARK No, not that high. \nMAN #3 So you mean the Thermosphere? \nMARK Look, people I got a lot to get through here. I'm just telling you what I know: Man. Lives in the sky. You can't see him. Controls everything. Cool? \nEveryone nods. \nMARK Number two: When you die you don't disappear into an eternity of nothingness. Instead, you go to a really great place. (PAUSE) Number three: In that place every person will get a mansion. \nMAN #4 What kind of mansion? \nMARK I don't know. Whatever kind of mansion you're thinking of right now. \nWOMAN #3 Oh no! I wasn't thinking of a mansion! \nA lot of people echo this sentiment. \nMAN #5 Shit! I was thinking of a horrible mansion! \nMARK Look, it's the best mansion you can think of, not just now, but ever. Whatever the best mansion for you can possibly be, that's the one you'll get. (CONTINUING) Number four: When you die, all the people you love will be there too. \nMAN #6 Will they have their own mansions? \nMARK Yes, of course. Everyone gets a mansion. \nMAN #6 What if I want them to live in my mansion? \nMARK If they want to live with you, they can leave their mansion and live in yours. \nMAN #6 What happens to their mansion? \nMARK I don't know, it goes back on the market. \nWOMAN #4 What about the people I hate? Will they be there too? \nMARK No. \nWOMAN #4 Where are they? \nMARK Okay, they're probably there, but you'll never see them. They're far off, too far for you to get there. \nWOMAN #4 But what if they try to find me? \nMARK They won't. They hate you too. \nWOMAN #4 But what if they don't? What if they love me but I hate them? \nMARK Well then you're just... you'll both be fine with it. There's only love there, okay? (CONTINUING) Number five: When you die there will be free ice cream. All day. All night. Whatever flavor you can think of. \nWOMAN #5 What, even bad flavors? \nMARK But why would you eat bad flavors? \nWOMAN #5 Well, you just said every flavor I can think of. \nMAN #8 Oh no, I just thought about vanilla and skunks! \nMARK Well don't eat it then! \nWOMAN #6 I've just thought the chocolate sauce is diarrhea! \nMARK Well don't put it on then! What's wrong with you people? I mean... (CONTINUING) (MORE) \nMARK (cont'd) Number six: If you do bad things you won't get to go to this great place when you die. \nMAN #9 Where will you go? \nMARK A terrible place. The worst place imaginable. \nJENNIFER What's with you? You seem sad. \nMark shrugs. \nJENNIFER I don't get it. You're a very successful writer, you've won countless awards and Oscars... \nJennifer waves towards a shelf full of Oscars and various other awards. \nJENNIFER You've changed the way people see the world, the way they see death and life. You've made the entire world happy. \nMARK Not the entire world. \nJENNIFER I know. Not you. The one person who should be happy, the person who has everything... \nMARK (INTERRUPTING) Not everything. \nJENNIFER What else do you want? \nMark sits up in his chair and looks right at Jennifer. \nMARK I'd trade it all in for you. All of it. \nJennifer sighs and sits down beside him. \nJENNIFER Well, you've got me. As a friend. \nMARK (not sarcastic) Yeah. That's important. (MORE) \nMARK (cont'd) But why can't we be together. Why can't you be with me? \nJENNIFER Because of the whole snub nosed thing. With kids, your genetics. You know, fat, short... \nMARK (stopping her) Yeah. Okay. Yup. (PAUSE) It's almost a shame that being rich and powerful and famous doesn't change your genetics. \nJENNIFER What? \nMARK It would be great if it changed your genetic material because I really love you but I just don't... \nSuddenly Mark has an idea. He looks right at Jennifer. \nMARK It does change your genetics. \nJennifer lights up. \nJENNIFER Does it? \nMark stares at her for a short beat. He can't go through with it. \nMARK No. No, it doesn't. Our kids would be short and fat with little snub noses. \nJENNIFER Right. Too bad. (PAUSE) Anyway, I've come to tell you I can't go to the movies with you tonight. \nMARK Why not? \nJENNIFER I've got a date. \nMARK What? With who? \nJENNIFER Rob Marlowe. \nMark stands up. \nMARK You've got to be fucking... Rob Marlowe?!? He's a complete and total asshole. \nJENNIFER Not to me. He's very sweet and kind to me. \nMARK Well of course he is, look at you. I mean, for fuck's sake, a shark would be nice to you... \nJENNIFER It would? \nMARK Well no, I mean... (PAUSE) Don't go out with him. \nJENNIFER Why not? He's a great match for me. \nMARK What's he got that I don't? \nJENNIFER We talked about this. If you and I got together it wouldn't be fair to our kids. They have the right to be attractive and have good genes. (PAUSE) If Rob and I get married You can move into our mansion with us when we all die. \nMARK I don't want to move into your fucking mansion. And what are you doing thinking about marriage with him already? You haven't even gone on one date. \nMARK Hey, Greg. What if I told you that drinking Coke was good for you? \nGreg turns to him, his face full of hope. \nMARK And not just Coke. But all the delicious foods you're not supposed to eat. What if they were all of a sudden really, really good for you? \nGREG It would be the happiest day of my life. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nA dozen high powered executives from all over the globe sit around a massive board room table. The head seat at the table is unoccupied. \nThey mumble back and forth to each other, unsure why they're there. \nMark bursts into the room in a suit, looking very manicured. \nMARK Gentleman, thank you all for coming here on such short notice. I have some very big news for you all today. \nEXECUTIVE #1 Is it from the Man in the Sky? \nMARK Nope, this one I came up with all on my own. And it's going to change the way you all do business... forever. \nMark hits a button and a projection screen comes down on the far wall. Mark starts a slide show. \nMARK Up until now, all products sold worldwide have warning labels printed on them. Warnings like these. \nSERIES OF SLIDES: We see the same warning we just saw on the Coke can, a commercial jet with \"This Plane Might Crash -- Four Of Our Other Ones Did\" printed on its side, a car dashboard light reading \"This Car will Ignite Upon Impact - Always\", and a sticker on a grocery store package of ground meat that reads \"Injected with hormones that make it taste better -- but will eventually give you cancer\". \nMARK As you can see, a lot of these products can be very depressing. They remind people of all the horrible things that can happen to them in life. People hate thinking about horrible things. \nEXECUTIVE #2 Yeah, but they have to know those things. (MORE) \nEXECUTIVE #2 (cont'd) They have to be able to protect themselves. I don't want to hurt anyone. Especially now that I know about the \"bad place\". \nEveryone in the room shudders. \nMARK Hear me out, fellas. Allow me to introduce you to the future of your companies. \nMark changes the slide to a can of coke that simple reads, \"Coke -- Tastes Great! And It's Good For You!\" \nEveryone in the room \"ahhhs\". \nEXECUTIVE #3 Where can I get some of that healthy coke? \nMARK It's the same Coke as before. \nThe executives all squint their eyes. \nEXECUTIVE #4 But this one is healthy! And it tastes great! \nEXECUTIVE #1 Do you have any samples? \nMARK Guys, it's the same Coke on the inside. I've just changed the outside. \nEXECUTIVE #1 (REVELATION) Somehow by changing the outside, he's also changed the inside! \nEveryone \"aaahs\" in understanding. Mark sighs and changes the slide to that of a commercial airliner with the words \"Completely Safe\" writing on the outside. \nEXECUTIVE #2 Oh, thank goodness. I've always hated flying! \nEXECUTIVE #3 Me too! \nEXECUTIVE #4 What an invention! How did you do it? \nMARK I didn't do anything, guys. I made this on my computer last night. The plane is exactly the same as it was before. \nNobody in the room gets it. \nEXECUTIVE #1 That's the only plane I'll ever fly on again! \nMARK That's the point here guys. With these new advertising strategies, people will buy your products with abandon. \nEXECUTIVE #2 But it will take years to replace all of our stock with these new improved products you've invented. \nMARK No. It won't. All you have to do is print these words on the packaging. That's it. \nMark changes the slide again: The car dashboard light now reads, \"This Car Prevents Crashes\", and another slide that shows a package of meat with a sticker reading, \"This Meat Actually Cures Cancer\". \nMARK Nevermind. I'll see you around. \nMark gets up and leaves. \nINT. MARK'S CAR -- DAY \nMark drives while we take in a bit of his world, highlighting the various changes he's wrought. \nA homeless man stands on the street corner with a sign that now reads, \"Screw it. I'll be in my mansion soon.\" He has a big smile on his face. \nThe same business man pulls up beside Mark's car, this time eating a giant donut and talking loudly into his cell phone. \nBUSINESS MAN I'm not talking to anyone on my cell phone. But from a distance I look very important and busy. \nAt a red light Mark eavesdrops on the same arguing couple. \nGIRLFRIEND No, I won't move into your mansion with you when we die. You're really smothering me. \nBOYFRIEND The more you push me away, the more attracted I am to you. \nA bus passes in front of Mark's car. The ad now reads, \"Pepsi. Just As Good as Coke.\" \nA car honks behind Mark. The man leans out of his car and yells at Mark. \nHONKING MAN Move it, fatty! \nAs the man passes him, he looks at Mark and pulls up beside him. \nHONKING MAN Hey you're Mark Bellison! \nMARK Yeah. So are you going to apologize? \nHONKING MAN For what? \nThe honking man speeds away. \nINT. GRAVEYARD - AFTERNOON \nMark sits in front of the gravesite of his grandmother. \nANGLE ON: Her tombstone which reads, \"Martha Bellison 1918- 2007. Lived an average life for a woman in her time.\" \nMARK Nothing's really changed. I gave people the Man in the Sky, made myself rich and successful, told the world they can eat whatever they want and feel good about it. Everyone's happy but me. Because I'm the only one who knows it all... isn't. I made it all up. (PAUSE) You're not up there living in a mansion. You're right here. In the ground. That's all. And I'm the only one who knows that. (PAUSE) And the one thing I want I can't have. Because the world is too stupid to change. The world only cares about what they can see, and what they can know, and what they're used to and what... makes sense. No one listens to what they really want. And that's why I'll always just be a loser, grandma. And that's why I'll always be alone. \nFADE TO: \nINT. MARK'S MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nWith a beer bottle in his hand Mark searches through his kitchen drawers for a bottle opener. He opens a drawer and something catches his eye. \nANGLE ON: The envelope which reads, \"MY INVENTION\". \nSlowly Mark pulls it out of the drawer and stares at it. \nThe sound of his front door opening startles him and Mark shoves the envelope into his back pocket. \nMARK Who's there? \nJENNIFER (O.S.) It's me. Can I come in? \nMARK Sure. \nJennifer enters the kitchen. \nMARK Haven't seen you much lately. \nJENNIFER I know. I've been busy with work and things. And I'm getting married. That's why I came over. To tell you. \nMark nods. \nMARK Don't do it. \nJENNIFER The wedding is tomorrow. \nJennifer pulls out an invitation, Mark waves it away. \nJENNIFER I hope you'll come. \nMark shrugs and Jennifer puts the invitation back in her purse. \nJENNIFER I don't feel all right. \nJENNIFER'S MOTHER What's wrong? Do you have food poisoning? \nJENNIFER No. I don't think there's a word for what I have. \nINT. \"CHURCH\" - DAY \n\"Here's comes the Bride\" plays over an organ and Jennifer walks down the aisle towards a smiling Rob. \nMark watches her in awe, stunned by her beauty. Rob notices Mark staring at Jennifer and mouths \"loser\" at him. \nJennifer reaches the altar and stands across from Rob. The WEDDING OVERSEER, an elderly man in a suit, stands between them holding a few sheets of paper in his hand. \nWEDDING OVERSEER We are sitting here in this building today to share in the wedding of Rob and Jennifer. Two young, attractive people who have agreed that this union would be mutually beneficial and that their genetic match-up would most likely produce favorable offspring and a life of financial stability and physical security. \nBoth Rob and Jennifer nod at each other. \nWEDDING OVERSEER Rob, do you promise to stay with Jennifer for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can? \nROB I do. \nWEDDING OVERSEER Jennifer, do you promise to stay with Rob for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can? \nJennifer doesn't respond. \nWEDDING OVERSEER Jennifer? \nJENNIFER (to Overseer) I'm sorry, hold on one second. (to Rob) Rob, can I ask you something? \nThere's a slight hubbub in the room. Mark perks up. \nROB (CONCERNED) Sure. But what are you doing? \nJENNIFER What color are my eyes? \nROB I dunno... (LOOKING) Oh, they're brown. \nCLOSE ON Jennifer's eyes. Indeed, they are brown. \nJENNIFER No Rob, they're blue. \nRob looks again. Mark stirs in his seat, amazed by what he's hearing. \nROB Oh, look at that. So they are. You've got pretty blue eyes. \nPUSH IN on Jennifer. It works. Her mind is reeling. \nROB Can we get on with this? \nWEDDING OVERSEER Jennifer, do you promise to stay with Rob for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can? \nJennifer is confused. Her mind is fighting it, but she doesn't know what exactly she's fighting. Finally... \nJENNIFER I do. \nThere is a sigh of relief from the room. Mark shakes his head in sadness. \nWEDDING OVERSEER Before I pronounce these two man and wife, is there anyone here who thinks they'd offer either of these people a better genetic match-up? \nMark bolts up in his chair. \nMARK Me. \nThe whole room gasps. \nROB Oh come on. Look at you. You can't be better. \nMARK Yes I can. You've got shmuck genes. \nROB Schmuck genes? What's that? \nMARK And I love her. (to Jennifer) Jennifer, don't marry him. Is this what you really want? \nJENNIFER I don't know. (pause; unsure) Yes? \nMark thinks this over for a beat. \nMARK All right. I'm done. Goodbye. \n", "test1_input": "MARK Come on guys. Are you serious? What's my name? \nGREG It's Doug. \nJIM Doug. \nMARK No. My name is Mark. \nGREG (still dead serious) Your name is Mark. \nJIM (still without hesitation) Hi Mark. \nGREG Mark suits you much better. \nJIM Mark-o. \nMARK You guys aren't following me. (THINKING) Okay, guys...I'm black. \nGREG I knew it. \nJIM You're very light skinned, but I can see it. \nGREG I've always wanted a black friend. \nMark punches the bar in anger. \nMARK Fuck it, I'm an Eskimo. \nGREG Fantastic. \nJIM I've never seen a black Eskimo. \nMARK Okay, I'm a pirate. \nGREG I didn't know they still had those. \nJIM Are you a dangerous pirate? \nMARK Okay then, I'm a lion tamer... and I have purple hair. \nGREG Aren't you scared you'll get bitten one day? \nJIM (to Greg) I want to die my hair purple just like Mark's. \nGreg nods. Mark sighs. \nINSERT: \"TWO HOURS LATER\" \nMark sits at the bar looking completely bored. \nJIM I'm a one-armed Jewish space explorer. \nGREG When's your launch date? \nJIM Shalom. How'd you lose your arm? \nMARK I invented the bicycle. \nGREG I love your work. \nJIM Can you get me a discount on a ten speed? \nMark sighs, finishes his beer and gets up to leave. \nMARK I give up. And I'm bored. \nMark heads towards the door, dejected. He turns back. \nMARK Guys, if you had the power to make things the way you wanted them, what would you do first? \nGREG If I could do anything in the world? \nJIM Anything at all? \nMARK Pretty much. \nGreg and Jim think this over long and hard. \nGREG I'd bone bitches asses. \n", "test1_true": "MARK Specifically the ass? \nGREG If I could change things I would make all the hot chicks bone me. \nJIM Agreed. \nMark mulls this over. \nMARK Alright then, let's try that. \nMark downs his beer and heads towards the exit. \nGREG Where are you going? \nMARK Out. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nMark walks the street, a hunter looking for his prey. \nWithin seconds Mark spots a gorgeous blonde walking right towards him. He stops in his track, quickly trying to decide how best to proceed. \nBut as the blonde passes him he just stares at her like a deer in the headlights. \nBLONDE Don't look at me, I'm not attracted to you. \nThe blonde walks away. Mark stands on the sidewalk staring off into space, the wheels in his mind working overtime. Then it hits him. \nMARK Wait! \nBLONDE Don't bother. I've heard it all before. \nMARK (BLURTING) THE WORLD IS GOING TO END IF WE DON'T HAVE SEX RIGHT NOW! \nImmediately the blonde's eyes well up in tears. She is terrified. \nBLONDE Do we have time to get to a motel or do we have to do it right here? \nMark is a caveman who just invented his penis. \nEXT. A MOTEL -- DAY \nThe neon sign outside reads \"A Cheap Motel for Intercourse with a Near Stranger\". \nWe slowly PUSH IN on the door of room 206. We hear noises inside that at first sound like moaning, but as we get closer... they sound more like crying. \nINT. MOTEL - ROOM 206 - DAY \nBawling her eyes out and sitting on the bed doing her best to get her shoes off, is the hot blonde. \nMark sits across from her, a look of guilt and revulsion on his face. This is not what he expected. \nBLONDE (BAWLING) I'm sorry, I'm just so scared. I don't want the world to end. (MORE) \nBLONDE (cont'd) I don't want to die in this motel room. I think I'm going to throw up. Help me get my pants off. \nMark stands up. The blonde grabs him and pulls him towards her. He pulls away. \nMARK This isn't right. \nThe blonde screams and drops to her knees. \nBLONDE No! We have to have sex! The world is going to end! Think of the children and little babies! \nMark looks down at this panicked, helpless girl and feels really, really bad about himself. \nMARK Just calm down for one second. \nMark walks over to the phone and picks it up. \nBLONDE How can I be calm? The world might end any second! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?! WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!! \nMARK (to phone) Hello... NASA? Yes, it's... me. Oh, good. That's very good news. Good news indeed. \nMark hangs up the phone. The blonde is rocking back and forth on the bed in a fetal position. \nMARK We're going to be okay. The world isn't going to end. Everyone is going to be fine. \nThe blonde tackles him in a bear hug, sobbing and laughing. \n", "test2_input": "The doctor leaves. Mark holds his grandmother's hand, her hand is shaking. \nMARTHA I'm so scared, Mark. I don't want to die. You know, people don't talk about it much, but death is a horrible thing. One minute you're alive, there's a whole world around you, humming and jumping, people coming in and out, doors opening and closing, love and anger and the whole mess of it all, and then like that, it's all gone. (CRYING) This is it Mark, only a few hours left of this until an eternity of nothingness. \nThe wheels in Mark's head are spinning again. Suddenly the heart monitor starts beating rapidly and Martha lurches in pain. \nMARK Grandma! \nMark immediately slams on the big red \"call nurse\" button, holding his grandmother down as she lurches in pain. \nSeconds later three nurses burst into the room. \nNURSE #1 She's seizing. \nNurse #2 begins filling a syringe. Mark sits by his grandmother's head, they're both looking right at each other. \nMARTHA I'm scared. \nMARK Listen closely to me, Grandma. I have a surprise for you. \nWe focus on Mark and his grandmother, inches from one another as the paramedics busy themselves around Martha's dying body. \nMARK You're wrong about what happens when you die. It's not an eternity of nothingness. \nMartha is hanging on to every word Mark is saying. \nMARK When you die you're going to go to your favorite place in the whole world. And you're going to be with all of the people you've ever loved and who have ever loved you. And you're going to be young again, and you'll be able to run through the fields and dance and jump, and there will be no sadness, no pain, just love and laughing and happiness. There will be ponies made of gold, and everyone will live in giant mansions, and everything will smell like cookies. And it will last for an eternity, Grandma. An eternity. \nTears are rolling down Martha's face as a glimmering smile overtakes her face. \nMark looks up to see the nurses, paramedics and doctors all staring at Mark in total shock. \nNURSE #1 Go on. \nDOCTOR What else happens? \nThe cardiogram flat lines. \nMARK Do your jobs! \nEveryone distractedly goes back to helping the grandmother. \nMARK You're going to be happy forever, grandma. I promise you. Say hello to my mom for me. Tell her I love her. \nAgain, everyone has stopped helping Martha, they're all listening intently. Some of them are crying. \nNURSE #2 (TEARFULLY) I'm going to see my mother again when I die. \nDOCTOR Tell us more, please. \nMartha stops breathing. The machine flatlines. And with that Martha is gone. \nMARK Damn it. \nMark turns away from his grandmother. Standing outside in the hallway is Jennifer, watching Mark with true empathy in her eyes. \nINT. MARK'S CAR -- MORNING \nMark and Jennifer pull up in front of Jennifer's apartment. There is a long beat of silence. \nJENNIFER I'm so sorry, Mark. \nMARK I think I just did something bad. \nJENNIFER Do you want to come inside? \nMark nods his head. \nINT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMark and Jennifer sit side-by-side on her couch. Mark holds a can of beer in his hand, gently turning it around in his palm, staring down at it vacantly. \nJennifer sadly watches Mark. \nSlowly and almost absentmindedly, Jennifer's hand moves over and rests gently upon Mark's wrist, settling there. \nWe hold on them for a long beat. \nFADE TO BLACK. \n", "test2_true": "THE NEXT MORNING \nMark and Jennifer have fallen asleep in the exact same position, both of them sitting side-by-side no the couch, her hand still on his wrist. \nMark opens his eyes and looks down at her hand, then up at Jennifer who slowly opens her eyes and smiles at him. \nJENNIFER Hi. \nMARK Hi. \nThey share a moment. \nINT. MARK'S CAR - MORNING \nA bleary eyed Mark drives home from Jennifer's. As he turns onto his street he finds hundreds of cars blocking the way. A massive crowd of people are leaving their cars and walking. \nMark gets out of his car to find a wild scene: hundreds of people camped out on the lawn of his apartment building. \nStanding by his door is the NURSE from the hospital. She immediately points at Mark and screams. \nNURSE #1 There he is! \nMark is bum-rushed by a question-asking throng. All of them are pelting Mark with questions, all of them confused and hopeful and desperately looking for answers. \nPERSON #1 Is there only one place you go when you die? \nPERSON #2 Will everyone who has ever died be there? \nPERSON #3 What's this place called? \nPERSON #4 Will I get to have sex with people there? \nMark pushes through the crowd, overwhelmed by it all. He gets to his door and opens it, only to have the Nurse step in his path and block the door. \nNURSE #1 You owe us an explanation. If you know something this important, you better tell us all. \nMARK Who are you people? \nNURSE #1 The words you spoke last night, to your grandmother, spread like wildfire. Please, tell us more. Explain what you said. \nMARK Fine, fine, just give me a minute. \nMark pushes past her and into his building, closing the door behind him. \nINT. MARK'S APARTMENT - DAY \nMark goes to his fridge and pulls out a beer. His mind is reeling. As he opens a drawer to get a bottle opener he sees the letter: \"MY INVENTION\". Mark eyes it ominously. \nThe phone rings. Mark screens the call. \nJENNIFER (V.O.) (leaving message) You've been gone for twenty minutes and I turn on the T.V to see you on every station. What's going on? This is seriously the weirdest thing... \nMark picks up the phone. \nMARK Remember last night when I said I think I did something bad? Well now I know I did something bad. \nJENNIFER They're saying that you know something different about what happens after you die. \nMark walks into his bedroom and turns on the TV. Sure enough there's a newscaster on his lawn, giving a report, with a banner on the screen that reads, \"New Death Discoveries\". \nMARK Hold on. \nMark puts down the phone and listens to the T.V. \nREPORTER (ON T.V) Twenty-four hours ago, Mark Bellison was just your typical nobody writer. (MORE) \nREPORTER (ON T.V) (cont'd) Today, people are saying he knows new information about what happens after you die. \nMark puts the phone to his ear again. \nMARK Fuck. \nJENNIFER Mark, what do you know? What did you tell your grandmother last night? What's going on? \nMARK I can't explain it all right now. Why don't you come over? \nJENNIFER Okay. \nEXT. MARK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON \n", "test3_input": "MAN #4 Does he cause natural disasters? \nMARK Yes. \nWOMAN #3 Did he cause my mom to get cancer? \nMARK Yes. \nWOMAN #4 Did he cause that tree to land on my car last week? \nMARK Yes. \nThe crowd is quiet for a long beat....they're mulling this over. The first man to speak is a blue collar guy with a thick Brooklyn accent. \nBLUE COLLAR GUY I say fuck the guy that lives in the sky! \nThe whole crowd erupts in agreement. People stand up shouting, flicking off the sky. \nMAN #5 Yeah! That guy's a fucking asshole! \nWOMAN #5 That motherfucker better hope I never see him face to face! \nMAN #6 That guy's a fucking coward! Hiding up there and doing bad shit to us! Why doesn't he do it to our faces? \nWOMAN #6 We need to stop that motherfucker before he kills us all! \nMark looks worried. He didn't anticipate this. Suddenly a thought occurs to him. \nMARK (SHOUTING) WAIT! \nEveryone quiets down. \nMARK This guy who lives in the sky and controls everything is also responsible for all the good stuff that happens. \nThe whole crowd \"aaaahhs\". \nMAN #7 He's the guy who saved my life on that fishing trip when the boat capsized? \nMARK Yup. \nMAN #7 Did he capsize the boat? \nMARK Well, yes. \nWOMAN #7 He's the one who killed my grandmother and left me those millions of dollars? \nMARK You betcha. \nWOMAN #3 So is he the same one who cured my mom's cancer? \nMARK That too. \nThe crowd thinks this over. \nMAN #8 So he's kind of a good guy, but he's also kind of a prick too? \nMARK Right. But check this out: (CONTINUING) Number eight: Even if the man in the sky does bad shit to you, he makes it up to you by giving you an eternity of good stuff after you die. \nThe crowd \"aaahhs\" again. \nWOMAN #1 As long as you don't do any of the bad stuff you listed, right? \nMARK Right. Of course. \nWOMAN #2 So it's kind of a test? \nMARK Yes. Right. (PAUSE) Well, that's it. That's everything I know. \nMark looks out at the crowd, they're all exhausted, their minds completely blown. The Nurse who started this all steps forward. \nNURSE #1 How do you know these things? \nMARK (THINKING) The man in the clouds told me. \nNURSE #1 Yeah, but how come we're just learning these things now, millions of years into our existence? \nMARK I don't know, he forgot or something. I gotta go people, good night! \nMark takes Jennifer by the hand and pulls her back inside his building. \n", "test3_true": "Mark, Jennifer and Greg wait for the elevator, all of them exhausted. \nMARK You think that went well? \nThe doors open and they get inside. All three of them stare ahead, Mark looking exhausted, Jennifer and Greg with their minds completely blown... as the doors close and we \nFADE TO: \nMONTAGE \nSpinning magazines and newspaper headlines proclaim \"Mansion for Everyone (almost)\", \"NASA searching for Man in the Sky\", \"Finally -- A Reason to Do Good\", \"Time: Man of the Year: Mark Bellison\", \"Mansion Prices Plummet Worldwide\", \"Cult of Bellison Await Further Answers\", \"Man in Sky Murders forty- two in Earthquake\", \"Man in Sky Continues to Give AIDS to Babies\", \"Workplace Productivity down Fourteen Percent -- Everyone Daydreaming About Mansions\". \nMark is at Lecture Films turning in the script for \"The Black Plague\" to Anthony. Rob gives Mark a dirty look as he passes him in the hall. \nMark, smiling proudly, stands behind the camera while Nathan Goldfrappe reads his script. In the background are Jennifer and Greg, hanging out on set. Jennifer can be seen chatting with Rob by craft services. \nMark removes the \"For Sale\" sign from the front yard of a brand new, beautiful home. Jennifer and Greg congratulate Mark enthusiastically. \nMark and Jennifer are walking down the street together when Mark stops to point out a new building with a sign that reads, \"A Quiet Place To Think About the Man in the Sky\". The building boasts a large stained glass window portraying Mark holding the two halves of the pizza box. \nMark, Jennifer and Greg laugh it up in a stretch limousine as it pulls up to the movie premier of \"The Black Plague\". \nMark, Jennifer and Greg walk the red carpet at the premier of \"The Black Plague\". Mark is the center of attention. Rob stops by on the red carpet to say hello to Jennifer and whisper something into her ear. Jennifer laughs. \nMark and Jennifer have dinner together, the best of friends, but as they cheers their champagne glasses there is a tinge of sadness in Mark's eyes. \nEND MONTAGE \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSCREEN READS: \"TWO MONTHS LATER\" \nINT. MARK'S MANSION - DEN - EVENING \nA disheveled Mark, unshaven and sloppy looking, sits in a reclining chair, wearing boxers and a bathrobe, drinking a beer. Beer cans are littered everywhere. \nA young gay man in a suit stands before him with a pad and a pen writing down everything Mark says. \nMARK So then the flying duck flew all the way to Alaska where it met up with a polar bear who could talk. And the polar bear's name was Martin. And the polar bear was wearing a green cape. And Martin and the flying duck both had race cars with their names printed on the side and... \nJennifer enters the room, upset. \nJENNIFER I just saw three people climbing the fence into your backyard. You really need to think about getting better security. (noticing beer cans EVERYWHERE) Mark, how many of those have you had? \nJennifer grabs the beer out of Mark's hand. \nMARK (continuing; glaring at JENNIFER) But then the evil goblin witch came in and stole the flying duck's race car and made the flying duck very angry. (grabbing at his beer) (MORE) \nMARK (cont'd) Luckily the Polar Bear was there to snatch the race car back... (But he misses) Unfortunately, the witch was a smart witch and the polar bear was powerless. \nASSISTANT Is that the end? \nMARK Yeah. \nASSISTANT That's a strange ending. \nMARK Hey, don't look at me: it's the Man in the Sky's story. \nASSISTANT You want me to take this over to Lecture Films? \nMARK Yeah. Tell them to shoot that one this week. \nThe assistant walks away. \nMARK (YELLING) Tell them it's for kids! \nJennifer glares at Mark, disappointed. \nMARK What? \nJENNIFER You haven't left the house in weeks. Every time I come by you're just sitting here writing down stories you get from the Man in the Sky. \nMARK Hey, he's the boss. \nJENNIFER Don't you think you should go outside sometime? You know there's about five thousand people on our lawn waiting to ask you questions. \nMARK Yeah, yeah. \nJennifer sits down next to him. \n"}

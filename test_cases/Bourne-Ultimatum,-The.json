We don't know. But just the fact that he was there means he's up to something, don't you think? Maybe he's the source? \nLANDY The real question is how you managed to get in a fire fight in the middle of a public train station. \nVOSEN Don't second guess an operation from an armchair, Pam.

His met his source in Turin. \nVOSEN So? \nLANDY So, what, Bourne met Ross for breakfast and then, at noon the same day Bourne calls Ross to demand a meet at Waterloo? \nCRONIN (Needling Wills) Maybe they were even on the same flight? \nVOSEN Cross check the secure cell phone usage of everyone with Blackbriar SCI clearance against all calls in and out of Turin during the morning Ross was there \nTECHNICIANS start pounding keyboards. \nFB3B   OMITTED                                                  FB3B \nFB3C   INT.

PARKING GARAGE -- TWO LEVELS BELOW ROOFTOP        275 \nBourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the roof lands hard behind him. \nBourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in a head on charge. \nThe just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control, shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to the floor as he dives out of the car. \nThe agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on. Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses, glass shatters, and airbags explode. \nBourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his car implodes against the oncoming agents. \nInstantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the course of the wrecked one. \nThe agents in this sedan are distracted by the still echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out and points his gun at the driver. \nThe driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the sedan's front tire and fires. \nThe tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against the unyielding interior of the sedan. \nAn instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it. \nWith the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan. \nBourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof, arrives and opens fire. \nThe police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single shot. \nThe increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs the officer's radio. \nBOURNE 10-13. Shots fired. Officer down. Port Authority parking lot. Level four. \nBourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift tourniquet for the officer.   Then he hands the cop his radio back. \nBOURNE (CONT'D) Stay out of sight until one of your own arrive. \nBourne disappears. \nWe pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the engine and heads for the exits. \nCRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps. But that's all the time Bourne needs-- \n276    OMITTED                                                      276 \n277    EXT.

It ricochets off several parked cars before regaining control. \n277A   OMITTED                                                  277A \n280    OMITTED                                                      280 \n281    EXT. CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY                                 281 \nBourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out by hitting his bumper. \nBourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car. The CRI sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan. \n282    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                     282 \nBourne is home free. He looks around and spots a sign that indicates a right turn and says \"To Holland Tunnel / US 95.\" Bourne turns right-- \nSuddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the top of Bourne's leg. \nREVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches it into the side of Bourne's car. \nBourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car. With his front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's car by sliding into his path. \n283    OMITTED                                                      283 \n284    EXT. MANHATTAN STREET -- DAY                                  284 \nBourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the slightly damaged sedan in pursuit. \nPaz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of. \nJust ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the intersection completely blocking his path. \nBourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues on, barreling into the roadblock backwards. \nAs Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake. \nPaz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a right hand turn onto South St. as Paz and the CRI sedan overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle. \n284A   OMITTED                                                    284A \nThey race uptown. \nWILLS She gave him the facility.

ELI (CONT'D) That's what our film's about -- or didn't you know? (sees Cameron) Hey, Burt, come over here. 
Cameron crosses to them. He and Raymond stand appraising each other, red-haired men in identical uniforms. As Raymond offers his hand: 
RAYMOND (to Eli) My new cock and balls? 
ELI (quickly) Not new...It's important not to let that get around as yet. So, for the time being, let's make like he's the same guy. (adding a touch of color) But no longer known as "Bad-assed Burt." Ever since his 'fortunate rescue,'...we call him "Lucky." 
62   EXT.   CHURCHYARD - ANGLE ON CHUCK - LATER THAT DAY 
CHUCK BARTON is a tall, rugged-looking man in his mid-thirties, the Stunt Gaffer on Eli's film. A MESSENGER trots up and presents a receipt book. Chuck sets down his stunt bag and signs it absently. 
MESSENGER Your film from that camera in the Duesenberg's on the way to the lab. Put it on the plane with my own little hands. 
CHUCK 
When do we get it back? 
MESSENGER Don't know. Stamped it "rush." 
CHUCK If I stamp "rush" on my mare's ass, she'll still take eleven months to foal. Call the lab and find out when! (quietly) I lost a man today. I wanna see that footage and find out why. 
As the Messenger leaves, Chuck strolls over to where Cameron stands waiting, circles around him, sizing him up. Cameron is no longer wearing the uniform, but now is in jeans and a work shirt. 
CHUCK Done any stunt work? 
CAMERON Not really. 
CHUCK Not really?   You have or you haven't? 
CAMERON (good-naturedly) I got out of Vietnam in one piece. Let me tell you that wasn't a bad stunt. 
CHUCK (skeptically) That's ancient history. 
CAMERON Seems like yesterday. 
CHUCK (pointing at church steeple) Could you jump from that tower to the that roof? 
63   ANGLE ON CAMERON (AND STEEPLE) 
Gauging the fifteen-foot gap between the CHURCH STEEPLE and the roof of the nearby MUNICIPAL BUILDING. He unconsciously grimaces at the four-story drop between them. 
CAMERON (being glib) Once, to save my ass, I jumped out of a banana tree into an oxcart full of buffalo shit. Does that count? 
CHUCK We'll see.    Put these on. 
He throws Cameron some knee pads from his stunt bag and begins marking off two lines on the bare earth between the gravestones in the churchyard. 
CAMERON (puzzled by the pads) Where do they go? 
CHUCK (tapping his knee) Under the pants. (pointing to lines he has drawn) I want you to jump from here...to there. 
Cameron hops up to the starting line, finishing with the knee pads clumsily, surveys the distance of not more than seven feet. 
CAMERON Okie-dokie. 
Makes a casual jump, landing on the line and looking at Chuck for approval. 
CHUCK Very good. Except you're dead!! Your brains are scattered all over the goddamn pavement. You landed on the edge and fell backwards four stories. Where do we send the body? 
CAMERON (returns to the starting line) Don't bury me yet. 
He takes a running start and leaps hard.    While he's still in mid- air, Chuck yells. 
CHUCK You're still dead! You fell over the other side of the building. 
Cameron has landed three beyond the mark and looks up at Chuck a bit shaken. 
CHUCK (CONT'D) You wanna try it right, once? You should land in a tuck-and-roll. 
CAMERON Show me, sergeant. 
Chuck launches himself head-first. His hands touch the ground just beyond the second mark to break his fall, easing him into a shoulder roll, he somersaults to his feet. 
CAMERON Very fancy. 
He takes a running start and does the same.   Not quite as well, but well enough. As he rolls to his feet: 
CAMERON Okay? 
CHUCK Better.

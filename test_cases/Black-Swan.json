{"train": "BLACK SWAN \nWritten by \nMark Heyman, Andres Heinz & John McLaughlin \nJanuary 11, 2010 \n1 INT. DARK STAGE - NIGHT 1 \nOPENING CREDITS: \nA SPOTLIGHT slices black space. \nIn its beam, a DANCER materializes. She is fair-skinned. Beautiful and pure. \nThe maiden twirls on pointe, a smile on her face, light as air and carefree. \nShe pauses, her face grows worried. Sensing someone watching. \nScared, she peers into the darkness. \nShe moves now, looking, growing more frantic. \nThen, a SINISTER MAN emerges out of the darkness behind her. She stumbles backwards, frightened. \nShe tries to escape, twirling away, but he pursues. His true form is revealed, the demon ROTHBART. \nHe flings his open hand towards her, casting the spell. \nShe wants to scream, but nothing comes out. She looks at her body, sensing something happening to her. Something terrifying. \nShe spins, panicking, but it's too late. She disappears beneath the beast's cape. \nShe emerges as the WHITE SWAN, the iconic protagonist of SWAN LAKE. \nCUT TO BLACK. \n2 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2 \nIn the darkness, a pair of EYES. They belong to NINA, the same dancer. She lies awake in bed, thinking about her dream. \nThe room looks like it hasn't been redecorated since she was a teenager. Stuffed animals. Dolls. Pink and frilly. \nThe door opens, throwing LIGHT on her face. Nina looks towards the door and smiles softly at whoever opened it. \nNina sits up and hangs her BARE FEET off the side of the bed. Like all ballerinas, she's beautiful and her feet are atrocious. Covered in corns, broken blisters and bunions. She arches them, doing her first extensions of the day. \n3 INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 3 \nThe room is empty of furniture to leave space for dancing. A large mirror covers the opposite wall entirely. \nNina rubs her knees to get them warm, and then begins her morning exercises, extending and contracting her feet and legs in precise and rhythmic motions. \nThe skin on her chest stretches tautly over her sternum. Defined vertebrae run up her back, sinewy muscles contract as she moves. Her slender neck leads into her hair, contained in a ballerina's bun. \nNina looks serene as she moves, completely in her element. \nShe hears someone fussing about in the kitchen. \nNINA (WHILE STRETCHING) I had the most amazing dream last night. I was dancing the White Swan. \nNo answer. \nNINA (CONT'D) Different choreography, like the Bolshoi's. It was the prologue, when Rothbart casts his spell. \nStill no answer. \nNina continues to stretch. \n4 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 4 \nNina sits at the table. An older woman, ERICA, places a POACHED EGG and a QUARTER-GRAPEFRUIT in front of her. \nERICA You're in a good mood. \nNINA I'm just excited to get back. \nERICA Off-season always makes you grumpy. \nNINA (RE: GRAPEFRUIT) Look how pink. So pretty. 2A. \nERICA NINA (inside joke) (inside joke) Pretty. Pretty. \nThey giggle and Erica resumes packing Nina's shoulder bag with extra clothing, shoes, snack filled tupperware, duct tape, ribbon, thread, etc. \nNINA (CONT'D) Plus he promised to feature me more. \nERICA He certainly should. You're the most dedicated dancer in the company. \nHer eyes are drawn to a NEW GIRL standing in the doorway. Nina pauses to scrutinize her. She wears vampy make-up, hair down. Dark and sexy. \nNEW GIRL Soloists? \nWary, the girls mumble mmm-hmm's and nod. \nNEW GIRL (CONT'D) Great. \nShe slinks past the suspicious group of girls and plops down at an open spot. \nNEW GIRL (CONT'D) Fucking got off the wrong stop and had to hoof it from 79th. \nNina exchanges glances with the other girls, taken aback. \nThe new girl notices the looks, smirks to herself and starts getting ready. \n9 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 9 \nNina wears a look of intense concentration as the entire company warms up, including the pubescent CORPS MEMBERS and a handful of MALE DANCERS. \nLEGS, HANDS, and FEET repeat the same movements all around her, led by a severe BALLET MISTRESS. \nBALLET MISTRESS To the back, fondu, to the back, plie. Fourth, fourth, and one and fifth, to the back... (to a corps member) Like this. Push it. Why can't you do this? \nUsing the mirror, Nina monitors her movements carefully. The mistress surprises her. \nBALLET MISTRESS (CONT'D) It needs to be looser. Relax. Let it flow. \nFlustered, Nina nods and tries to follow her instruction. \nSuddenly, the girls around Nina begin stripping off their sweatshirts and insulated pants. \nNina sees that the intense and brooding director of the company, THOMAS LEROY, has entered the space. He has the unkept look of an artist. Magnetic and intense. \nThe ballerinas remove their warm-up gear to show off their bodies. \nLeroy walks around the room, judging his flock. Smiles and glances are thrown his way. \nHe goes up to the ballet mistress, takes her hand and kisses her on the cheek. Even she manages a smile. \nHe heads to the line of soloists, studying them. \nLEROY We all know the story: virginal girl, pure and sweet, trapped in the body of a swan. She desires freedom, but only true love can break the spell. \nHe taps a dancer on the shoulder, she lights up. He walks, then taps another. A selection process of some kind. \nNina looks nervous, has an inkling of what it means. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Her wish is granted in the form of a prince. \nHe nears Nina. She sneaks peeks at him, eager and hopeful. He acknowledges her with a small nod and a smile. \nBut he walks on without tapping her. She deflates. \nLEROY (CONT'D) But before he can declare his love, her lustful twin, the Black Swan, tricks and seduces him. \nHe approaches the New Girl. Nina watches, threatened. \nBut he doesn't tap her either. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Devastated, the White Swan leaps off a cliff, killing herself. But, in death, finds freedom. \nHe taps one more soloist and then CLAPS. \nThe music stops and all the girls face him, attentive. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Good morning, company. \nThey respond \"Good morning\" in nervous, unsure voices. \nLEROY (CONT'D) We open our season with Swan Lake. Done to death, I know. But not like this. We strip it down. Make it visceral and real. \nHe pauses for effect. \nLEROY (CONT'D) And a new production needs a new Swan Queen. A fresh face to present to the world. \nSurprised, the soloists glance at each other, trying to keep their cool. \nLEROY (CONT'D) But which of you can embody both swans? The white and the black? \nNina prepares for disappointment. \nLEROY (CONT'D) All the soloists I touched... Please go to your scheduled rehearsals this afternoon. \nThe girls are confused. \nLEROY (CONT'D) And the girls I didn't touch, meet me in studio B at five. \nNina breathes, realizing the girls he didn't tap are the ones he's selected, purposefully toying with them. \nThe New Girl obliviously marches into the room, listening to an iPod. \nLEROY (CONT'D) (SARCASTIC) Good of you to join us. \nThe New Girl notices everyone staring and pulls out her earphones to talk. \nNEW GIRL Sorry. \nLEROY Girls, this is Lily. Straight off the plane from San Francisco. She's filling Rebecca's old spot. \nLILY gives a small wave. Nina eyes her with scorn as she catches her breath. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Go on, get warmed up. \nLILY I'm good. \nLily starts stripping off her layers, revealing her lithe body. On her back, she has a TATTOO OF LILIES. \nNINA Should I go again? \nLEROY (distracted by Lily) I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina. \nShe looks down, getting his meaning. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Okay, Veronica. Your turn. The White Swan's variation... \nFurious, Nina marches out of the room. \nA13 INT. THEATER BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT A13 \nNina stands up from a kneeled position and flushes the toilet. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and exits the stall. \n13 OMITTED 13 11A. \n14 OMITTED 14 \n15 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 15 \nNina walks along a quiet side street. She clutches her jacket, for warmth and comfort. \nHer CELL PHONE starts ringing. She digs it out of her bag and checks the CALLER ID: MOM. She silences it and puts it away. \nUp ahead, she sees the sidewalk dead end at a construction site, and detour into an enclosed PASSAGEWAY beneath the scaffolding. \nNina slows, a little scared, but decides to push on. \nThe passageway is dark. The temporary lighting dim and flickering. \nShe walks quickly, trying to get to the other side. \nShe hears the sound of soft FOOTSTEPS approaching. She stops, and the other FOOTSTEPS stop. \nShe looks up and sees the faint outline of a SLENDER WOMAN standing there, almost ghostlike. \nNina starts walking again, keeping her head down, and the other woman continues as well. \nAs they pass each other, Nina glances at the woman's face and discovers... \nThe woman looks EXACTLY LIKE HER. \nBut the moment passes as the woman continues walking. \nNina stares after her, perturbed. \nHer cell phone starts RINGING again, piercing the silence. Nina continues out, ignoring the phone. \n16 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 16 \nNina enters and locks the deadbolt and chain-lock behind her. \nShe turns and is startled to see Erica standing right there. \nERICA How did it go? \nNina looks at her confused. Erica helps take off her coat. \nERICA (CONT'D) You were late, so I called Susie in the office. An audition?! Can't believe he just sprung that on you. \nNina nods. \nERICA (CONT'D) So? \nNINA It went okay. \nERICA Just okay? \nErica hangs up her coat, turns and sees Nina tearing up. \nERICA (CONT'D) Darling? \nNina waits anxiously outside Leroy's office. \nShe hears someone approach, looks up and sees Leroy coming down the hall. \nShe puts on a nervous smile. He doesn't reciprocate. \nLEROY Yes, Nina? \nNINA Do you have a minute? \nHe doesn't answer, just opens the door to the office and walks in. \nShe takes a breath and then follows. \n23 INT. LEROY'S OFFICE - SAME 23 \nNina closes the door and faces the cozy, dark space. Large couch, posters from the ballet on the wall--several featuring Beth. \nLeroy lights a cigarette, quietly studying her and not making this easy. He takes a drag, and exhales. \nNINA If now's not a good time... \nLEROY Now's fine, what is it? \nNINA I just wanted to tell you, I practiced the coda last night, and I did it. \nLEROY How thrilling for you. \nNINA (THROWN) Well... \nLEROY Okay, Nina, listen, I honestly don't care about your technique, you should know that by now. \nNINA Yes, but- \nLEROY Anyway, I've already chosen Veronica, so... \nHe lifts his hands in the air, \"there you go.\" \nNINA (DEVASTATED) I see. \nShe makes a move towards the door. \nLEROY You're not going to try and change my mind? \nShe looks back at him, uncertain. \nLeroy nonchalantly stubs out his cigarette. \nLEROY (CONT'D) You must have thought it was possible, coming to find me like this. \nHe pauses, looks her up and down as if trying to decipher her. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Why are you here? All dolled up? \nNINA (UNSURE) I came to ask you to give me the part. \nLEROY That all? \nShe doesn't know what he means. He comes around his desk and approaches her. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Truth is, when I look at you, all I see is the White Swan. Yes, you're beautiful, fragile, fearful. Ideal casting. But the Black Swan...it's a hard fucking job to dance both. \nNINA I can be the Black Swan too. \nLEROY Really? She's hungry, volatile. In four years, every time you dance, I see you obsess over getting each move exactly right, but I never see you lose yourself. \nInsecure, she looks like she wants to run out of the room. \nLEROY (CONT'D) All that discipline, for what? \nNINA I want to be perfect. \nHe laughs. \nLEROY Perfection's not just about control. It's also about letting go. Surprising the audience. Surprising yourself. Transcendence. \nHe considers her for a moment. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Very few have it in them. \nNINA I- 18A. \nWithout warning, he slowly plants a kiss on her mouth. \nIt lasts for a moment, but he suddenly jerks away. \nLEROY Ow! Fuck! \nHe touches his lip, stunned. \nShe wipes the tears off with the back of her hand and pulls herself together. She comes out of the stall... \nHorrified to discover \"WHORE\" written on the mirror in RED LIPSTICK. \nNina looks around the bathroom, to make sure she's alone. \nShe snags a paper towel and wipes off the insult, smearing the mirror with red streaks. \n27 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 27 \nNina unlocks the door to the apartment. \nNINA Mom? \nNina looks around, puzzled she isn't there. \n28 INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATER 28 \nNina opens the door and pokes her head in. \nBut Erica's not in there either. Nina glances at the walls. \nWhere several homemade PAINTINGS hang, all of the same subject: Nina as a young girl, posing in a tutu. On a desk, the ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPH is clipped to a painting in progress. \nOut of the corner of her eye, one of the portraits seems to shift. Nina turns towards it, but the painting's now perfectly still. \nUnsettled, Nina withdraws. \n29 INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 29 \nPost-shower, Nina's fuzzy reflection stares back in a steam covered mirror. \nNina takes her hand and wipes a streak across, to see herself more clearly. \nShe looks nervous. The enormity of what's in front of her setting in. \nShe turns side-to-side, scrutinizing her body. She lifts her arm and pinches the skin to check her weight. \nShe notices a small cluster of RED BUMPS on her shoulder. A small RASH. \nShe feels the bumps with her fingers, bothered. \nShe checks the same place on her other shoulder. \nThere's no rash, just faint streaks of SCAR TISSUE. \nNina slides the hamper in front of the door to block it. \nIn the mirror now, one of the bumps is scratched and bleeding. \nNina quickly wipes the blood off with her finger. \nThe sound of the front door opening steals her attention. \n30 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 30 \nNina exits the bathroom wearing a robe. \nIn the kitchen, she sees a CAKE with a lit SPARKLER sitting on the table. Her mother smiles anxiously. \nERICA My daughter, the Swan Queen. \nShe opens her arms and Nina falls into a hug. \nShe looks at the cake. It has a ballerina sketched with frosting. Nina hides her disdain. \nNINA Oh, mom. \nERICA It's our favorite, vanilla with strawberry filling. \nErica picks up a knife and slices into the cake. \nNINA Just a little piece. \nErica ignores her and starts cutting a very large piece. \nNINA (CONT'D) That's way too much. \nERICA It's a celebration. \nNINA My stomach's still in knots. \nERICA (OFFENDED) Fine then. \nErica grabs the whole cake and heads towards the trash. \nNINA (GUILTY) Mom, don't. I'm sorry. \nErica hesitates, but returns. She sets the cake back down. \nSUSIE Those are for you. From Mr. Leroy. \nNINA Beautiful. \nSusie leaves. \nNina pulls a card out from the flowers and reads. A faint smile curls her lips. \nShe opens her shoulder bag and removes a SMALL SATCHEL. She pulls out a pair of DIAMOND STUD EARRINGS and puts them on. \n35 INT. PATRON OF THE ARTS APARTMENT - NIGHT 35 \nLeroy pulls Nina through a fundraiser gala, filled with rich looking PATRONS and some DANCERS from the company. \nBewildered, Nina takes in her high-society surroundings, getting the occasional curious glance as she passes. \nLeroy grabs a couple CHAMPAGNE glasses off a WAITER'S tray. He hands a glass to Nina with a smile. \nHe leads her up a staircase to a landing that overlooks the party. \nLEROY Ready to be thrown to the wolves? We need their cash, so smile. \nShe smiles, as instructed. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. \nThe crowd turns their gaze towards them. All eyes on her. \nLEROY (CONT'D) As I stand here tonight, I see so many familiar faces. Your contribution to the art we all cherish profoundly goes straight to my heart and I am very grateful. \nPolite applause. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Let me begin with a very important announcement. You all have had the chance to be enchanted, transported, sometimes devastated by the performances of this true artist of our company. She has been an exceptional inspiration to my work, a role model to our dancers and a deeply satisfying presence on our stage. You all know who I am talking about...Beth Macintyre \nMore applause. Nervous, Nina unconsciously picks at her cuticles. \nLEROY (CONT'D) As we all know, every great career comes to an end. Beth is retiring at the end of the season. She will be giving her farewell performance as Melpomene, the role she originated in my first ballet. \nPeople start whispering, stunned by the news. Nina sees Beth in the crowd, giving a sad smile to the surrounding guests. Trying to remain dignified. \nLEROY (CONT'D) She will be greatly missed, but she will always be remembered. My little princess. \nAmidst the mummering, Nina sees Beth quietly sneak out of the crowd and out the front door. Leroy quickly covers. \nLEROY (CONT'D) But as we bid adieu to one star, we welcome another! \nHe looks at Nina. She stops picking her nails, self- conscious. \nLEROY (CONT'D) As you know, we open our season with my new version of Swan Lake. Taking the role of our new Swan Queen is the exquisite Ms. Nina Sayers. \nRestrained APPLAUSE. \nNina steps forward and curtseys. Someone seems to GIGGLE at her. Insecure, Nina glances towards the source and sees Lily flirting with a RICH GENT, uninterested in the official proceedings. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Soon you will have the pleasure of seeing her perform, tonight we raise a glass. To all of you, to Nina, to Beth, to beauty! \nHe downs his drink and the crowd follows suit. \n36 INT. LIVING ROOM, PATRON OF THE ARTS APARTMENT - LATER 36 \nPARTY GUESTS surround Nina and Leroy, trying to meet the company's newest star. Nina basks in all the attention. \nLEROY Dr. Brinson and his lovely wife, Ellen, tonight's sponsors. \nShe shakes DR. BRINSON'S hand and curtseys to MRS. BRINSON. \nNINA Such a beautiful event. \nMRS. BRINSON Not as beautiful as you, dear. \nNina demurs. They're replaced by another HUSBAND and WIFE. \nLEROY And this is Mr. and Mrs. Stein. \nNina repeats the pleasantries, this time noticing that one of her cuticles is bleeding. She awkwardly pulls her hand away. \nLeroy leans in and whispers in her ear. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Relax, you're doing great. \nCUT TO: \n37 INT. BATHROOM - LATER 37 \nNina washes her hands. She looks at herself in the mirror and takes a deep breath. \nSomeone KNOCKS on the door. \nNINA Just a second. \nSpotted, the figure backs up, seeming to disappear. \nNina cautiously approaches, but can't see anyone. \nShe gets closer to the doorway...and someone JUMPS OUT, startling her. \nIt's Beth, drunk and shivering. Cheeks streaked with mascara. \nNINA (CONT'D) Beth? What are you doing out here? \nBeth stares her down. Nina backs up, nervously grabbing her earlobe. \nNINA (CONT'D) I was crushed to hear that you're leaving. \nBETH What'd you do to get the role? \nNina shakes her head, confused. \nBETH (CONT'D) He always said you were a frigid little girl. \nHer words needle Nina, too close to the truth. \nBETH (CONT'D) So what did you do to make him change his mind? Suck his cock? \nNINA Some of us don't need to do that. \nNina's struck a nerve. Beth starts to come at her. \nBETH You fucking little whore. \nNINA (GUILTY) Beth, I'm- \nLEROY (O.S.) What's going on? \nThey both turn to see Leroy returned. \nBETH I need to talk to you. \nLEROY You're drunk. You should go home. \nBETH Don't do that! Don't just dismiss me! \nLEROY (EXASPERATED) Poor, poor little princess. Try to hold it together. \nBETH I'm going to drop by later, okay? I have something I want to give you. \nLEROY (IGNORING HER) Come on. \nHe puts his arm around Nina, starts to lead her away. \nBETH (O.S.) A token of my appreciation. \nHe ignores her and raises his arm to hail a cab. As they enter the cab, Beth calls after them. \nBETH (CONT'D) Make the most of it Nina. \nThrough the cab window Nina looks at Beth, troubled by her words. \n39 INT. LEROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 39 \nTasteful but spare loft. Modern and expensive furniture. Large windows. \nNina stands alone, looking around his inner sanctum, wide- eyed. \nShe explores the pieces of art, the furniture. She touches some of it, in awe. \nLEROY (O.S.) Here. \nShe turns, finds Leroy holding out yet another flute of champagne. For himself, a scotch. \nNINA Thanks. \nShe looks up at him, expecting him to make a move. Instead, he walks away, and sits in a chair. He gestures for her to sit as well. \nConfused, she sits across from him, alone on the large couch. \nHe takes an unceremonious sip of his drink and studies her. Uncomfortable, she takes a drink as well. \nLEROY I thought it'd be good to talk about the role. Ground us a little. \nNINA Yes. \nLEROY The better we get to know each other, the more productive we'll be. I don't want there to be any boundaries between us. \nNINA Me neither. \nLEROY Good. So, do you have a boyfriend? \nShe's caught off guard by his question and just smiles uncomfortably. He waits for an answer. Finally she manages a reply. \nShe tests it. Holds pretty well. \nShe hears a creek. FOOTSTEPS approach. She removes the wood and sticks it inside her dresser, not ready just yet. \nShe quickly lies down on her bed and waits to be tucked in. \nThe door SQUEAKS open, and Nina looks towards it. 42A. \n48A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 48A \nNina, David, and the dancer playing ROTHBART rehearse the Black Swan and Prince Siegfried's Pas De Deux from Act 3. \nDavid lifts her, then sets her down, and they lean-in towards each other, almost kissing. \nLEROY No, no, not so stiff. Don't be scared of him. \nShe pulls away from David, not at all coyly. Leroy exhales, frustrated. \n48B INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - ANOTHER DAY 48B \nNina and David dance the next part of the section, looking more worn out. \nLEROY Forget about control. I want to see passion. \nShe still looks tense, not getting it. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Let it out! \n48C INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - ANOTHER DAY 48C \nNina practices with an OLDER BALLET MISTRESS. She demonstrates a movement, and Nina mimics her. The mistress scrutinizes, unimpressed. \nA49 INT. PHYSICAL THERAPIST'S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY A49 \nNina is worked over by a PHYSICAL THERAPIST. Every joint and muscle aches, but Nina breathes through the pain. \n49A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - YET ANOTHER DAY 49A \nNina and David finish the section, completely soaked with sweat. \nThey look at Leroy, heaving breaths. \nLEROY David, answer me this question: are you interested in fucking her? \nDavid snickers, embarrassed, shakes his head. \nLEROY (CONT'D) No, of course not. No one would be. \nLeroy comes face to face with her. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Nina, your Black Swan still looks no different than your White Swan. She's's just as...frigid. \n49B Suddenly, the lights turn off, throwing them into total 49B darkness. 43-46A. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Fuck! \nLeroy angrily marches to the door and whips it open. \nLEROY (CONT'D) (to someone in hall) Hey! We're still working in here. Lights back on. \nThere's a momentary pause, and then the lights return. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Thank you! (to David, Piano Player) Okay, you guys can go. Thank you for your patience. (TO NINA) You stay. \nDavid gives her an insinuating glance, then shakes his head. Very used to Leroy's \"methods.\" \nDAVID Have fun. \nDavid and the Piano Player leave them alone. \n49C Leroy approaches Nina and takes her hands in his. 49C \nLEROY I'll be the Prince. \nMade nervous by his touch, she nods. \nHe walks behind her and puts his hands on her waist. \nHe starts humming the score. And then they begin. \nThey do a series of lifts and spins, Leroy bracing her. \nHe lets go, she moves away from him. \nLEROY Use each finger, your face, your tits, everything. Entice me! \nHe grabs her wrist. She spins. He lets go. He grabs her other wrist, she spins to face him. \nThey get very close. \nNina stands and goes to the other end of the car. He continues singing, undeterred. \n58 OMITTED 58 \n59 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 59 \nNina sits on the floor in a loose sweatshirt, sewing ribbon onto pointe shoes. \nErica sits across from her, sewing ribbon onto another pair. \nERICA Has he tried anything with you? \nNina doesn't respond. \nERICA (CONT'D) He has a reputation... \nNina tries to ignore her. \nERICA (CONT'D) I have a right to be concerned, Nina. You've been staying late so many nights. \"Rehearsing.\" I hope he's not taking advantage, that's all. \nNINA He's not. \nERICA Good. I don't want you making the same mistake I did. \nNINA (INSULTED) Thanks. \nERICA Not like that. I just mean as far as my career was concerned. \nNINA What career? \nERICA The one I gave up to have you. \nNINA You were 28. \nERICA So? \nNINA And only... \nNina bites her tongue. \nERICA Only what? \nNINA Nothing. \nERICA What? \nNINA (DEFIANT) Nothing. \nErica glares at her. \nERICA How's your skin? \nNINA It's fine. \nERICA We leaving it alone? \nNINA Yes. \nERICA Let me see. \nNina stares back defiantly. \nERICA (CONT'D) Take off your shirt. \nNINA No. \nErica starts to come towards her. \nThe DOORBELL RINGS. \nErica looks at Nina questioningly. Nina shakes her head. \nErica goes to the door and cracks it open, keeping the chain engaged. \nERICA (to person outside) Can I help you? (pause) I'm sorry, she's not in. \nErica shuts the door. Nina rushes out to see who it was. \nNINA Who was it? \nErica doesn't answer. \nIrritated, Nina walks around Erica and quickly opens the door to find out. \nERICA It's no one. \n60 INT. BUILDING HALLWAY- NIGHT 60 \nNina sees a ballerina walking away from the door. \nWAITER Let me know if it's not juicy enough. \nLILY Oh, I will. \nHe smiles, keeping his eyes locked on Lily, as he rudely plops down Nina's plate. \nWAITER Enjoy. \nLily watches him go, then notices Nina looking annoyed. \nLILY What? \nNINA Guess I'm invisible. \nLily studies her and digs into her purse. Pulls out a SEXY SHIRT. \nLILY Here, wanna spruce up? \nNina gives her a puzzled look. \nLILY (CONT'D) I always carry a spare, case I wake up somewhere unexpected. \nLily picks up her ungainly burger and takes a big bite, a little grease dripping down her chin. Nina cuts into her dry chicken breast. \nLILY (CONT'D) Not like you need more attention these days. How is he? \nNina doesn't understand the question. \nLILY (CONT'D) Thomas? \nNINA I wouldn't know. \nLILY Yeah, right. \nNINA I don't want to talk about it. \nLILY Relax, you're so tense. \nLily pulls out a cigarette case and clicks it open. Inside, CIGARETTES and a couple PILLS. \nLILY (CONT'D) One for you... \nLily grabs one of the pills and slides it over. \nLILY (CONT'D) And one for me. \nLily grabs her pill and downs it with a beer. \nNina stares at her pill, too embarrassed to admit she doesn't know what it is. \nLILY (CONT'D) Don't worry, it's pure. Brought it with me straight from San Francisco. \nNINA What is it? \nLILY You're kidding? You never rolled? \nNina blinks. \nLILY (CONT'D) Oh boy. It'll just make you have a good time. Loosen up. See the night sky. \nNINA (CURIOUS) How long does it last? \nLILY Couple hours. Tops. \nNina looks at the pill, thinks about it for a second... \nNINA That's okay. \nLILY Sure? \nNina nods. Lily puts the pill back, and SNAPS the case closed. \n62 INT. GRUNGY BATHROOM - NIGHT 62 \nWearing the SKIMPY SHIRT Lily offered her, Nina rinses her mouth out with water from the sink, then checks herself out in the mirror. \nIt's broken and covered with graffiti and stickers. One particularly bright one says, \"Seize the Day-glo.\" \nNina's cell phone RINGS. She checks the ID--\"MOM\"--and silences it. \nNina puts her SWEATSHIRT back on over the shirt, and exits. \n63 INT. CORNER BISTRO - NIGHT 63 \nNina returns to her table, but when she gets there, Lily is gone and the table is cleared. \nShe looks around the crowded room, doesn't see her anywhere. \nShe heads towards the exit, and sees Lily at the bar, flirting with TWO ATTRACTIVE MEN. She's very touchy-feely. \nTOM You've got some mouth, you know that? \nLILY Isn't that compliment a little premature? \nLily sips her drink, staring at Tom flirtatiously. \nNINA You guys should come sometime. I can comp you tickets. \nTom laughs, amused by Nina's earnestness. \nTOM Yeah...that'd be neat. \nLILY I think we all need another round. Bottom's up. \nShe looks at Nina and sucks down her drink, challenging her to follow suit. Nina takes a breath of courage and empties her glass. \nShe waits for something to kick in. \nLILY (CONT'D) Tom, come with me? \nLily slips out of the booth and Tom follows, leaving Nina and Andrew alone. She avoids his gaze, nervous. \nANDREW So...what are you guys working on these days? \nHer cell phone RINGS, interrupting him. She quickly turns it off and gives him an embarrassed smile. \nNINA Sorry. Swan Lake. \nANDREW Yeah? \nNINA You know it? \nANDREW Oh, no, not really. Heard of it though. What's it about? \nNINA It's about a girl who's been turned into a swan. She needs love to break the spell. \nANDREW Okay. \nNINA Yeah, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself. \nANDREW So a happy ending, then? \nNINA It's beautiful, actually. \nANDREW Like you. \nShe starts to feel the initial tingles of the drug. \nNINA Huh? \nANDREW I said you're beautiful. \nShe giggles. \nANDREW (CONT'D) That funny? \nShe gives him a flirtatious glance. \nNINA My hands are all sweaty. \nAndrew touches them. She grabs onto his hands. She looks at his face. His eyes twinkle at her. \nLily slides in next to her. Nina sees her and melts into her body. Lily hugs her back. \nLILY Uh oh! Looks like someone's rolling. Let's get you dancing. \nA65 OMITTED A65 \n65 INT. DANCE CLUB - NIGHT 65 \nNina kisses Tom on the floor of a crowded dance club. The drug is in full effect. \nThe world has soft edges, colors are vivid and bleed into one another. \nLily twirls her around. \nNina attaches herself to her, hungry for the attention. A cheering section of guys surrounds them. \nNina lets loose. Dances with abandon. \n66 INT. CLUB BATHROOM - LATER 66 \nNina makes out with someone, her back pushed up against the wall. Her eyes are closed, she's shiny with sweat. \nShe opens her eyes, confused to find that it's not Andrew or even Tom, just a STRANGE MAN. \nShe backs away. He reaches for her, but she swats him off. \n67 INT. DANCE CLUB - SAME 67 \n72A INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - SAME 72A \nShe grabs the broken PIECE OF WOOD from the dresser and jams the door. She backs Lily away, preparing for the storm. \nNINA Don't come in here! \nErica tries to open the door, but it gets stuck. She peers her eye through the crack. \nERICA What's this? \nNINA It's called privacy! I'm not fucking twelve years old anymore! \nErica struggles a little with the door, but can't get it to budge. \nERICA You're not my Nina right now! \nNINA LEAVE ME ALONE!!! \nNina SHOVES the door shut. \nErica's FOOTSTEPS retreat, followed by the SLAM of her bedroom door. \n72B Nina is worked up, breathing hard. 72B \nLILY (O.S.) Whoa... \nNina turns around and sees her Double smiling at her. \nNina flees to the door. Pauses. She peeks back and sees that it's actually Lily. \nRelieved, she grabs Lily and kisses her, revved-up. \nLily responds with equal force. They claw at each other, passion exceeding coordination. \nLily pulls Nina's shirt off and throws her onto the bed. \nShe straddles Nina, who looks up at her carnivorously. \nLily takes her own top off, plunges down and kisses Nina. \nNina flips Lily over, becomes the dominant one. \nLily scratches Nina's back, over some of the rash. \nThere's subtle movement underneath the skin. Little pin pricks push up the flesh, trailing behind her hand. \nSelf-conscious, Nina grabs Lily's hand and holds her wrists down. \nShe bites her neck. Lily smiles, likes the violence. \nShe digs her nails into Nina's hands. \nThen Lily gets back on top of Nina. The tattooed lilies on her back undulate and spread out. Morphing into dark wings. \nShe kisses down Nina's body. Further and further... \nLily starts to go down on Nina. \nNervous, Nina whimpers. Glances down and sees the DOUBLE. \nShe tries to pull away. \nLILY shushes her. \nNina calms back down, seeing that it's her. She takes a breath and succumbs. \nBumps shoot up all over her skin as her breath quickens. \nShe closes her eyes, allows the sensation to invade her body and CLIMAXES. \nShe breathes her way back to earth. Slowly her eyes open. She rolls over towards Lily. But Lily is gone. \nInstead her DOUBLE hovers over her. \nDOUBLE Sweet girl. \nShe SMASHES a pillow over Nina's face. \nCUT TO: \nA73 OMITTED A73 \n73 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 73 \nNina lies alone in bed, the sheets and comforter in disarray. \nShe sits up, clutches her head in pain. \nShe looks around, but there's no sign of Lily or the Double. \nLILY (CONT'D) What, you have some kind of lezzy wet dream? \nNina glances at the dancers, nervous they've heard. \nNINA You're lying. \nLILY (TICKLED) Oh my god, you totally fantasized about me. \nNINA Stop. \nLILY Was I good? \nNINA (BARKS) Shut up! \nOther dancers look over. \nNina resumes stretching. Lily just walks away. 74-76A. \nA77 INT. STAGE - DAY A77 \nNina dances the end of the ballet, the White Swan's suicide. \nLEROY The Black Swan has stolen your love. There's only one way to end the pain. \nNina climbs the stairs of the set and arrives at the \"cliff,\" stopping at the precipice. \nLEROY (CONT'D) You're not at all fearful. Filled with acceptance. \nNina looks down. It's a short drop to a stack of pads, but a HARD FLOOR surrounds it. \nLEROY (CONT'D) You look at the Prince, then down at Rothbart, and, yes, up at the audience...And jump! \nShe hesitates, fearful. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Go ahead. You'll be fine. \nNina takes a breath and leaps in a swan dive. \nShe falls...and lands in the pads, unhurt. Slight applause from the other dancers. \nLEROY (O.S.) (CONT'D) Everybody get a drink then it's notes. \nNina lies in the pads, completely exhausted. \nB77 INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER B77 \nNina sits backstage, toweling herself off. \nShe pauses, noticing Leroy and Lily conversing near the doorway. \nLily nods and touches his arm. He smiles warmly, then notices Nina watching. His serious demeanor returns and he pulls away. He says goodbye to Lily. \nLily follows his gaze and smirks at Nina, rubbing it in, before exiting herself. 74-76B. \n77 OMITTED 77 \n78A-B OMITTED 78A-B \n79 OMITTED 79 \n80 OMITTED 80 \nA81 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT A81 \nNina kneels in front of the toilet, a finger down her throat. She gags, but nothing comes up. \nHer eyes tear up, and she tries again, but still just heaves. \nFrustrated, she wipes her mouth and flushes. \n81 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 81 \nNina exits the bathroom and approaches her mother's bedroom door. It's closed, but the light's on underneath. \nShe's about to knock, but hesitates. Through the door, she can hear the sound of her mother watching an INFOMERCIAL on TV. An unfamiliar, lonely noise. \nNina stands there for a moment, just breathing. She strengthens her resolve and backs away from the door. \n82 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 82 \nNina collapses on her bed. \nShe opens the JEWELRY BOX sitting on her night stand. \nShe watches the ballerina spin for a moment... \nThen suddenly SLAMS the lid shut and throws the box hard against the wall. \nShe shoots out of bed and starts gathering all her childish possessions--stuffed animals, dolls, keepsakes, etc. \nNINA No, she's different. She's after me. She's trying to replace me. \nLEROY (CONDESCENDING) Nina... \nNINA Please believe me. \nHe studies her for a moment, not sure what to make of this. \nLEROY Listen, I know it's been a struggle. But you had a breakthrough this morning. \nNina starts to speak, he holds up his hand to silence her. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Tomorrow is yours. Give a great performance, and you won't have to worry about Lily, or anyone else. \nNINA THOMAS- \nLEROY No more. Go home and rest. \nShut down, she watches him walk away. \n84 OMITTED 84 \n85A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - NIGHT 85A \nNina practices the Black Swan, alone with the jaded piano player, working herself hard. \nHe suddenly stops playing. \nNINA What happened? \nPIANO PLAYER I gotta life, deary. \nHe closes the music book and stands. \nPIANO PLAYER (CONT'D) Don't work too hard. It's your big day tomorrow. \nAnnoyed, she watches him leave. \n85B She faces herself in the mirror and takes a breath. 85B \nShe resumes dancing without music, her feet CLICKING on the floor. \nAs she moves, she notices something strange out of the corner of her eye: \nThe reflection's dancing lags a little behind hers. \nNina stops. The sound of her footsteps stops a second later. She stares at the mirror...troubled. \nThe door to the room BANGS shut. \nShe whips towards it and she's suddenly plunged into DARKNESS. \nFreaked, she stumbles towards the door, and pushes out into THE \n86A INT. STAGE - NIGHT 86A \nWhere it's equally dark. Lit only by the stage's \"ghost light,\" a single bulb on a stand. \nNINA Hey! Hey! I'm still in here. \nNo one answers. \nShe looks at the cavernous auditorium. All those empty seats, faced towards her. Very overwhelming... \nShe hears a noise in the wings. \nNINA (CONT'D) Hey! Turn the lights back on! \nShe gets to the other side of the stage, but the wings seem empty. Quiet. \n86B Then she hears the faint sound of MUFFLED BANGING. 86B \nNINA (CONT'D) Hello? \nNo one answers. \nShe heads towards the noise. The banging now accompanied by a GIGGLE. \n87 INT. WINGS - SAME 87 \nIt's pretty dark but the sound is unmistakable: two people going at it. \nNina tiptoes past some off-stage SETS and LIGHTING EQUIPMENT. \nAnd peeks around a piece of SCENERY... \nCatching a glimpse of Leroy fucking Lily further backstage. She's wild, clearly enjoying it. \nNina looks away, disgusted. She peeks back one more time. \n90 INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - SAME 90 \nShe hits the GROUND FLOOR BUTTON, and hides in the corner. \nAs the doors close, she looks down and sees that, in one hand, she holds the BLOODY EMORY BOARD. \nShe drops it, disgusted. \n91 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 91 \nNina runs in and quickly shuts the door behind her. Takes a breath, and notices some blood still on her hands. \nA92 INT. KITCHEN - SAME A92 \nShe flips on the light. The room's empty. \nShe goes to the sink and washes her hands. \nShe finishes, and flips the light off as she walks out of the room. \nShe pauses, rushes back and flips on the light. The Double stares at her from the corner, her face covered in blood. Terrified, Nina runs. \nB92 INT. BATHROOM - SAME B92 \nShe goes straight to the toilet and VOMITS. \nShe hears a creaking sound in the apartment and looks towards the open door. \nNINA Mommy?! \nShe goes out to investigate. 83A. \n92 INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME 92 \nNina flings open the door, but Erica's not in there. \nShe hears RUSTLING, then WHISPERING. \nNina looks around the room. The paintings of herself seem to move slightly. Blink. Mouths move. \nThey whisper: \"Sweet girl\" and then start chanting \"My turn, my turn, my turn!\" \nNina cups her hands over her ears, trying to block it out. \nShe hears a BANG and looks towards the door. No one's there. \nShe glimpses the mirror, which reflects down the hallway. She sees her Double rushing towards the room. \nScared, Nina whips around, just as her mother arrives in the doorway. \nERICA What are you doing? \nNina pushes past her, in a frenzy. \n93 INT. BEDROOM - SAME 93 \nNina closes the door. Sticks in the broken piece of wood. \nA pain shoots through her shoulder. She SCREAMS, instinctively reaching for it. \nShe quickly yanks off the sweater and looks at the vanity mirror. \nHer back pulsates unnaturally. Tiny black tips poke through. \nThe door opens and catches on the doorjamb. \nErica starts POUNDING. \nNINA GO AWAY! \nShe digs into the open bump on her shoulder with her fingernails. \nERICA Open the door!!! \nErica violently pushes and pulls, jostling the piece of wood. \nNina concentrates, takes hold of the growth and yanks. \nBlood vessels in her eyes explode, making the white turn red. \nNina looks at the object held in her fingers: a sharp, TINY BLACK SPINE. Like that of a sea urchin. Damp, feathery wisps hang off of it. \nThe door flings open. \nErica rushes in and finds Nina half-naked, her skin inflamed. \nERICA (CONT'D) Oh my god... \nNina starts forcing her out the door. Erica pushes back. \nNina rifles through her dresser drawers. \nShe notices her mother sitting calmly. \nNINA Move. \nERICA Nina... \nNina grabs her by the wrist. \nERICA (CONT'D) Stop it. \nNINA You're crazy! \nERICA What happened to my sweet girl? \nNina yanks Erica off the chair onto the floor. \nNINA She's gone. \nERICA Please, you're not well. \nUnder the cushion Nina grabs the hidden brass DOORKNOB. \nErica lunges for her daughter's legs. \nNINA Let go! 87A. \nERICA You can't handle it! \nNINA I can't?! I'm the fucking swan queen! You never even got out of the corps. \nERICA You fucking ungrateful- \nNina jams the knob onto the post, opens the door. \nERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D) Don't leave! Nina! \n95 EXT. THEATER - EVENING 95 \nNina approaches the theater with harried steps. \nQuickly past the row of SWAN LAKE posters. \nShe reaches the side of the building, flings open the stage door and enters. \n96 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - EVENING 96 \nNina frantically makes her way down the bustling hallway, chaotic with dancers. Excitement in the air. \nShe nears the soloists' dressing room. \nJust outside of it, she spots a group of DANCERS excitedly chatting around a smiling Lily. \nNina stops in her tracks. \nLily glances in her direction, and her smile quickly fades into a sneer. \nLILY What are you doing here? \nThe other girls follow her gaze towards Nina, and their smiles turn to confusion. \nLEROY (O.S.) Nina? \nShe turns and finds that Leroy has approached from behind her. \nLILY You're supposed to be sick. \nLEROY Lily, give us a minute. \nLeroy pulls Nina towards her room. Lily glares at Nina as she passes. \n97 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 97 \nLeroy closes the door behind them. He looks at Nina, wheels spinning. \nLEROY Are you okay? \nNINA I'm fine. \nNina goes to her wardrobe, finds her two costumes hanging. One for the White Swan, one for the Black Swan. \nLEROY Nina? \nShe doesn't heed him, pulls out the White Swan leotard and sets it on her chair. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Nina! \nNINA What? \nSTAGE MANAGER That's you! \nShe leaps back on \n111C STAGE 111C \nFor the Coda. She takes a brief pause, closing her eyes once more, and then completely lets herself go. \nShe spins with ferocity. More BLACK FEATHERS burst out from her shoulders and back. \nAt last, she truly embodies the Black Swan. \nShe finishes the Coda, punctuating her last spin with a sharp step that echoes through the theater. \nThe audience looks on, mesmerized. Too stunned to clap at first. \n111D Nina looks down at the stage, her face glazed with sweat 111D \nShe has returned to normal. No feathers. Normal eyes. A woman. \nShe finally looks up at the audience, and they ERUPT in a standing ovation. \nNina walks to the front of the stage, takes her bow. \nNina looks up at the MASS OF BODIES filling the auditorium, vibrating with applause. \nProud, Nina smiles and bows again. Again and again. \nShe finally runs off stage, the applause still going strong. \n112 INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME 112 \nNina enters the wings, other dancers cheer loudly. Even Veronica and Galina. \nShe pushes past all the smiling faces. It feels very surreal. \nShe sees Leroy clapping and shaking his head. Blown away. \nLEROY Get back out there! Get back- \nShe stops his mouth with a kiss. The kind of kiss that you can't stop. Not desperate, but adamant. \nFinally she disengages, staring at him in the eyes, but before he can say anything... \nShe turns and rushes back on stage. He's stunned. Like he's been run over by a truck. \n113 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - LATER 113 \nShe walks towards her dressing room, a satisfied smile on her face. \nShe passes the stage manager. \nSTAGE MANAGER Great job. You got fifteen til the last act. \nShe nods and arrives at her room. \nShe opens the door, makes sure no ones looking, and enters quickly. \n114 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 114 \nShe closes the door behind her, locks it. Turns and sees the broken glass all over the floor. \nShe eyes the closed wardrobe. A pool of blood drips out from under the door. \nShe picks up a towel and lays it over the blood. \nShe starts to undress. \n115 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 115 \nBack in the White Swan costume, she re-applies the makeup. \nThere's a KNOCK on the door. She looks towards it, her face only halfway made-up. \nNINA One second. \nShe goes to the door, opens it just a crack. \nShe peeks through and finds... \nLILY looking back at her. \nLILY Hey...you were amazing. \nNina's petrified. \nLILY (CONT'D) Seriously. I'm sorry things got so messed up between us. Just, holy shit, totally blown away... \nNina barely manages a nod. \n", "test1_input": "NINA NO- \nErica yanks her out of the room. \n41 INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 41 \nNina sits on the toilet, stripped to her underwear. She does her best to cover herself. \nErica finishes dabbing her back with HYDROGEN PEROXIDE and replaces the cap on the bottle. \nShe pulls out NAIL CLIPPERS and cuts Nina's nails down to their base. Each CLICK makes Nina twitch. \nERICA I thought you'd outgrown this disgusting habit.(click) You haven't done it for years. (click) \nNINA Mom, please. \nErica grabs Nina's other hand. \nERICA It's the role, isn't it? All this pressure... I was worried it'd be too much. \nNina stares at her, seething. \n42 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - LATER 42 \nNina crawls into bed, avoiding her mother's eyes. \nERICA Don't be mad at me. You know I love you, you know I want what's best. But we have to take care of you. \nNina doesn't respond. \nErica opens the JEWELRY BOX and the tinny music begins playing. \nShe hums and starts to stroke Nina's hair. \nNina tries to brush her hand away. \nBut Erica brings it back and keeps stroking. \n43 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 43 \nNina lies wide awake after a restless night. \nShe slowly reaches down under the covers, down between her legs, to complete Leroy's \"homework assignment.\" \nShe closes her eyes and starts to maneuver. \nShe suddenly hears a RUSTLING sound and a short SNORE. \nShe freezes and opens her eyes. She slowly sits up in bed and sees Erica SLEEPING on a chair in the corner of the room. \nNina glares at her. \n44 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 44 \nNina waits her turn as a row of DANCERS perform grand jetes diagonally across the room. \nShe watches Veronica perform her leaps. She rejoins the group, giving Nina a nasty stare. \nNina avoids it, looking towards Lily, who gives her a small smile. \nJust as Nina's turn arrives, a panicked YOUNG CORPS DANCER rushes in and makes a beeline for the severe ballet mistress. \nNina takes one leap and then stops dancing, sensing something's wrong. \nThe corps dancer whispers into the ballet mistress' ear. A look of shock on the mistress' face. \nThe dancer collapses into the older woman's arms. \nThe piano music trickles to a halt. \nNina exchanges glances with some of the other dancers. \nFirst a few, then more dancers approach the two women, wanting to find out what's happened. \nNina hangs back, filled with a sinking feeling. \n45 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER FOUNTAIN - DAY 45 \nNina sits as Leroy, worse for the wear, stares at the jets of water. \nNINA What happened? \nLEROY She walked into the street, got hit by a car. \nNINA Oh my god... \nLEROY I'm sure she did it on purpose. \nNINA How do you know? \n", "test1_true": "Nina hesitates, but has to ask. \nNINA Was it right after we saw her? \nLEROY It's not your problem. This has nothing to do with you. \nShe looks away, not so sure. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Nina, don't let yourself be distracted. Dance is not immortalized like music, poetry or art. It lives for now. For this moment only. And this is your moment. \nShe attempts a nod. \nA46 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - DAY A46 \nBeth's belongings have already been packed up and cleared. Guilt-ridden, Nina tries to get ready. \nShe picks up her duffel bag, and removes her SATCHEL. She unpacks its contents onto the counter: needle and thread, cigarettes, a makeup compact, and the tube of lipstick. \nShe looks over at the vase of flowers. A few have wilted. \nShe pulls them out to make the bouquet look fresh again. \n46 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 46 \nNina exits the elevator with a BROWN SHOPPING BAG. She walks down a stark hallway and approaches Beth's hospital room. \nMembers of BETH'S FAMILY surround the bed, blocking Beth from view. \nNina considers going in, but shyly sulks past, drawing the attention of an OLDER NURSE. \nOLDER NURSE You can go in. \nNINA It's okay. \nThe older nurse gives her a skeptical glance and continues on her rounds. \nNina walks a little further and leans against the wall to wait. \nShe hears the sound of shuffling feet, looks over, and sees the group of people exit the room and walk down the hall, comforting one another. \nNina steps out from hiding and goes inside. \n47 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM- DAY 47 \nBeth is bandaged and unconscious, attached to MACHINES. \nNina stands at a distance, too intimidated to approach at first. \nShe looks around the room. It is lined with large, EXPENSIVE- LOOKING BOUQUETS. \nShe removes the flowers Leroy gave her from the brown bag, and sets them next to the others. \nNina slowly approaches Beth's bedside. \nBeth's face is heavily wrapped with bandages. Only her closed eyes and pale lips can be seen. \nShe scans down her body, sees a sliver of her thigh, purple with bruises. \nCurious, Nina lifts the top edge of the blanket and peeks underneath. \nThe legs are bloated and horribly bruised, pierced with large pins to reset the shattered bones. \nShe looks lower and lower, and discovers MAGGOTS feeding on her ankles. \nNina turns away, confronted by the Older Nurse. \nOLDER NURSE What are you doing?! \nNina doesn't have an answer. She just stumbles out the door. \nA48 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT A48 \nNina steps out of her apartment into the dim hallway, lugging a bag of trash. \nShe notices some WOODEN DEBRIS from an apartment renovation sitting near the trash chute. \nNina drops the trash bag in the chute, then picks up a piece of BROKEN WOOD. \nShe considers it for a moment, and hides it inside the sleeve of her sweatshirt. \nB48 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - LATER B48 \nNina quietly steps inside and heads towards her bedroom. \nThrough Erica's open bedroom door, Nina can see Erica busily sewing ribbon onto pointe shoes, humming to herself. \nNina quietly slips back inside her room. \nShe removes the wood piece and jams it between the door closet, creating a makeshift doorjamb \n", "test1_id": 1941, "test2_input": "Lily smirks with a realization. \nLILY Someone's hot for teacher. \nNina gives her a withering glance. \nLILY (CONT'D) It's okay. I don't blame you. \nNina stands up. \nNINA I should go. It's getting late. \nLILY Hey, I was only playing. \nNina walks towards the door. \nLILY (CONT'D) Nina? \nShe ignores Lily and exits. \n51 OMITTED 51 \n52A INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 52A \nNina lies in the bath, eyes closed, concentrating. \nHer body jostles slightly, moving her hand between her legs, seeking release. \nGrowing frustrated, she moves more and more aggressively. \nShe abruptly stops and submerges herself under the water, defeated. \nShe lies still, her arms wrapped around her chest. \nShe opens her eyes, her vision distorted by the water. \nSuddenly, her blurred Double appears, staring down at her. \nNina shoots up. \nThe Double is gone. \nNina scans the bathroom, but she is alone. \nNina notices some water dropping off her fingers, onto the lip of the tub. \nThen a few drops of RED land on the white porcelain. \nWorried, she examines her fingernails, which have started to grow back. She discovers blood and bits of skin. \n52B LATER 52B \nOut of the tub, Nina checks herself in the mirror. Her shoulder is streaked with deep SCRATCHES. \nShe grabs a pair of little SCISSORS from the medicine cabinet and starts trimming her fingernails. \nShe looks up at the mirror and sees her reflection snip off the tip of her index finger. \nNina GASPS and drops the scissors, CLANGING in the sink. Two of her fingers are bleeding, their tips sliced. \nERICA (O.S.) (CONCERNED) Nina? \nNina looks at the door, already blocked by the hamper. \nNINA I'll be out in a second. \nShe stays still, hoping she won't try to come in. \nFootsteps recede and Nina breathes. \nShe runs her hands under some water to clean off the blood. \n53 OMITTED 53 \n54 OMITTED 54 \n55 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 55 \nDavid and Nina dance the Black Swan's Pas de Deux. Once again, Nina's rigid and self-conscious. \nLEROY Try it again. \nThey resume dancing. She finishes, out of breath, and looks at Leroy and the Russian ballet mistress. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Again. \nThe piano music starts up again, and she begins dancing. \nWhen she finishes, she looks at him, eager for feedback. \n", "test2_true": "The music starts up again. Nina stays still, frustrated. \nNINA Do you have any corrections? \nLEROY No. \nShe doesn't understand. He gets up from his chair and goes to her. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Lily talked to me. Said she saw you crying. \nNina looks away. Can't believe Lily talked to him. \nLEROY (CONT'D) She said you were upset and I should \"take it easy\" on you. \nNINA I didn't tell her that. \nLEROY Maybe you'd like a break for a day or two. \nNINA THOMAS- \nLEROY Or a fucking month. \nNINA She shouldn't have said anything! \nLEROY I don't care! You shouldn't be whining to her! \nNINA I didn't. \nLEROY You could be brilliant. Taking it easy would be a betrayal. \nHe walks away from her. \nNINA I'm sorry. I'm sorry. \nLEROY Stop saying that! Stop being so damn weak! \nHe tosses his chair across the room. SMASHING into the wall. \n56 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 56 \nFurious, Nina heads towards the soloists' dressing room. Hears them chatting in their usual manner. \nNina KNOCKS loudly at the door, interrupting them. \nVERONICA (RESENTFUL) Look who's gracing us with her presence... \nNINA Lily, I need to talk to you. \nLILY Okay... \nNINA Now. \nVERONICA (you're in trouble) Ooooh. \nThe other girls giggle. \nLILY Shut up. \nAnd they do. \n57 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 57 \nNina leads Lily to a private nook, fuming. \nLILY What's wrong? \nNINA You told Thomas about last night? \nLily falters, guilty. \nLILY I ran into him this morning. He said you guys were having some trouble. \nNINA Why would he talk to you? \nLILY Whoa your highness, I just told him you're working your ass off and I'm sure you'll be great. \nNINA You shouldn't have done that. \nLILY I didn't fucking do anything. \nLily takes off. Nina stares after her, at a loss. \nA58 INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT A58 \nNina sits on the subway, going home. She notices that one of her fingernails has a jagged edge. She removes an EMORY BOARD from her bag and begins filing it down. \nA SKEEZY MAN across the aisle ogles her. \nNina keeps her eyes down, trying to ignore him. He starts to sing an OLD LOVE SONG from the 20's. \n", "test2_id": 1942, "test3_input": "Nina rushes from the wings, directly into David's arms. \nAll the swans are frozen in two rows on each side of the stage, looking downstage. \nDavid launches Nina into the air, hands around her waist. \nHe slowly turns her around, keeping her held high. \nFrom her swirling, bird's eye view, Nina sees the rows of identically dressed Little Swans glaring at her... \nNina freaks, jerking her body. \nDavid's grip SLIPS and Nina SLAMS onto the stage. \nIt's a horrific moment that feels like an eternity. \nGritting her teeth, Nina looks up around her, sees the faces of the other ballerinas. Staring at her sadistically. \nNina finds Lily, glancing at David. He snaps to and quickly helps Nina up. \nDAVID What the fuck? \nShe's too freaked to respond. \nThey resume dancing, Nina barely keeping it together. \nBehind them, Rothbart appears and commands his flock to exit. The Little Swans start swirling off stage. \nLeaving Nina and David alone. \nDavid tries to pull her in one direction, but the dark hand of Rothbart summons her, transforming her back into a swan. \nShe pulls away from David, frantically flapping, until she disappears into the wings. \n105 INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME 105 \nAs soon as she's off, she breaks down, hyperventilating. The dancer playing ROTHBART eyes her with concern. \nROTHBART You alright? \nShe looks up, sees his creepy MASK, and backs away. \nRothbart has to go back on stage to finish the Act. \nOther CORPS MEMBERS surround her, chirping \"You okay?, \"What happened?\" etc. \nDazed, Nina doesn't answer. The music ends and there's a weak smattering of applause. \nSTAGE MANAGER That's intermission! Act 3 in fifteen. \nThe other dancers scurry to get ready, abandoning her. \nNina sees Leroy on stage chewing David out, behind the closed curtain. \nDavid spots Nina, glares at her, and sulks away. \nLeroy runs his fingers through his hair, his back to Nina. \nNina cautiously approaches. \nNINA It wasn't my fault. He dropped me. \nHe can't even look at her. \nLEROY (RAGING) What a fucking disaster! \nHe walks away. \nAll alone, Nina sees everyone backstage looking at her. \nShe runs, escaping their stares. \n106 OMITTED 106 \n107 INT. PRINCIPLE'S DRESSING ROOM - SAME 107 \nShe closes the door behind her, ready to cry. \nShe looks up, and finds Lily putting on makeup and wearing the Black Swan costume. \nLILY Rough start, huh? Pretty humiliating... \nNINA Get out of here. \nLILY Wow...rude. \nLily coyly smiles, and continues applying makeup. \nLILY (CONT'D) I'm worried about the next act. Not sure you're feeling up to it. \n", "test3_true": "LILY How about...I dance the Black Swan for you? \nNina looks into the mirror. Instead of Lily's reflection there's the Double. \nNINA Leave me alone. Leave me alone. \nDOUBLE (IN MIRROR) But it's my turn. \nNina's fury rises up from inside. \nNINA Leave me alone!!! \nShe charges... \nAnd smashes her into the WALL LENGTH MIRROR, shattering it. Shards fall everywhere. \nThe Double flips Nina over and wails on her. Punch after punch. \nNina does her best to block the onslaught. \nThey scuffle, knocking things over, bumping into walls. \nThe Double gets her hands around Nina's neck... \nGasping for air, Nina tries to pull the hands free, but she's too strong. \nHer hands frantically scramble along the surface of the floor. The fingers barely touch the edge of a MIRROR SHARD, but can't grasp it. \nThe Double squeezes down. \nThe blood vessels in Nina's eyes BURST again. Her neck starts to stretch unnaturally. Strength surges through her body and she lunges... \nFinally grabbing the SHARD. \nAnd DRIVES it into the Double's stomach. \nNina glances at her hand, cut by the mirror, then back up. \nThe Double is now LILY. Stunned, Lily looks down and touches the stab wound. \nNINA (CONT'D) It's my turn. \nLily coughs up blood and collapses, dead. \nNina stares at her, breathing heavily, high on adrenaline. \nA KNOCK on the door. \nSTAGE MANAGER (O.S.) Black Swan, places in 5. \nNina drags the stiffening body into the wardrobe closet. \n108 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 108 \nNina zips up the back to the Black Swan costume. \nShe deliberately applies the Black Swan makeup. Dark eye shadow and rouge, maroon lipstick. \nDressed in black and wearing the dark make-up of the Black Swan, she looks fierce. \nShe stares at her reflection, her eyes burning RED. New rash bumps pop up on her arms, the intensity building within. \n109 OMITTED 109 \n110 OMITTED 110 \n111A INT. STAGE - NIGHT 111A \nNina bursts onto stage as the Black Swan, accompanied by Rothbart. \nShe looks powerful, intense as she moves towards David. \nHis face shows his surprise. \nNina dances the first Pas de Deux with him. They finish and EXIT \n111B BACKSTAGE 111B \nDAVID WOW- \nShe walks away from him. \nAlone, she looks at her arms, sees black points trying to push through again. \nSome fully emerge as shiny BLACK FEATHERS. \nShe just watches them, not panicking, but accepting the transformation taking place. Even beckoning it. \nHer second entrance cue is played. \n", "test3_id": 1943}

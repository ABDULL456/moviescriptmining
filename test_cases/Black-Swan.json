{"test1_input": "BLACK SWAN \nWritten by \nMark Heyman, Andres Heinz & John McLaughlin \nJanuary 11, 2010 \n1 INT. DARK STAGE - NIGHT 1 \nOPENING CREDITS: \nA SPOTLIGHT slices black space. \nIn its beam, a DANCER materializes. She is fair-skinned. Beautiful and pure. \nThe maiden twirls on pointe, a smile on her face, light as air and carefree. \nShe pauses, her face grows worried. Sensing someone watching. \nScared, she peers into the darkness. \nShe moves now, looking, growing more frantic. \nThen, a SINISTER MAN emerges out of the darkness behind her. She stumbles backwards, frightened. \nShe tries to escape, twirling away, but he pursues. His true form is revealed, the demon ROTHBART. \nHe flings his open hand towards her, casting the spell. \nShe wants to scream, but nothing comes out. She looks at her body, sensing something happening to her. Something terrifying. \nShe spins, panicking, but it's too late. She disappears beneath the beast's cape. \nShe emerges as the WHITE SWAN, the iconic protagonist of SWAN LAKE. \nCUT TO BLACK. \n2 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2 \nIn the darkness, a pair of EYES. They belong to NINA, the same dancer. She lies awake in bed, thinking about her dream. \nThe room looks like it hasn't been redecorated since she was a teenager. Stuffed animals. Dolls. Pink and frilly. \nThe door opens, throwing LIGHT on her face. Nina looks towards the door and smiles softly at whoever opened it. \nNina sits up and hangs her BARE FEET off the side of the bed. Like all ballerinas, she's beautiful and her feet are atrocious. Covered in corns, broken blisters and bunions. She arches them, doing her first extensions of the day. \n3 INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 3 \nThe room is empty of furniture to leave space for dancing. A large mirror covers the opposite wall entirely. \nNina rubs her knees to get them warm, and then begins her morning exercises, extending and contracting her feet and legs in precise and rhythmic motions. \nThe skin on her chest stretches tautly over her sternum. Defined vertebrae run up her back, sinewy muscles contract as she moves. Her slender neck leads into her hair, contained in a ballerina's bun. \nNina looks serene as she moves, completely in her element. \nShe hears someone fussing about in the kitchen. \nNINA (WHILE STRETCHING) I had the most amazing dream last night. I was dancing the White Swan. \nNo answer. \nNINA (CONT'D) Different choreography, like the Bolshoi's. It was the prologue, when Rothbart casts his spell. \nStill no answer. \nNina continues to stretch. \n4 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 4 \nNina sits at the table. An older woman, ERICA, places a POACHED EGG and a QUARTER-GRAPEFRUIT in front of her. \nERICA You're in a good mood. \nNINA I'm just excited to get back. \nERICA Off-season always makes you grumpy. \nNINA (RE: GRAPEFRUIT) Look how pink. So pretty. 2A. \nERICA NINA (inside joke) (inside joke) Pretty. Pretty. \nThey giggle and Erica resumes packing Nina's shoulder bag with extra clothing, shoes, snack filled tupperware, duct tape, ribbon, thread, etc. \nNINA (CONT'D) Plus he promised to feature me more. \nERICA He certainly should. You're the most dedicated dancer in the company. \n", "test1_true": "Erica walks over with a SWEATSHIRT and holds it above her. Nina pulls it over her head and starts to push her arms through the sleeves. \nERICA (CONT'D) (NOTICING SOMETHING) What's that? \nNINA What? \nERICA There. \nErica points to her shoulder. Nina feels and finds a small SCRATCH MARK. \nShe shrugs and shakes her head. \nErica gives her a suspicious look, but lets it go and smiles. Nina finishes pulling down the sweatshirt. \nErica hugs Nina into her chest and kisses the top of her head. \nERICA (CONT'D) Sweet girl. \nErica releases her and Nina begins eating. \n5 INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY 5 \nNina rides inside a crowded subway, staring absentmindedly at her faint reflection in the train's window. \nSuddenly, another train roars by on the opposite track, snapping her awake. \nIn the next train car, she sees the back of a BALLERINA standing in the midst of the crowd. Her head bops to music playing through iPod earphones. \nNina moves a strand of hair out of her eyes, and at that exact moment, the girl in the next car moves in the same way. Mirroring her. \nUnnerved, Nina slowly lowers her arm. So does the other girl. Although Nina can't quite see her face, the girl seems IDENTICAL from Nina's vantage point. \nThe train jerks to a stop as it arrives at a station. Nina sees the girl head to the exit. She cranes to see her face, but her view's obscured. \nThe doors slide shut and the train pulls out. Nina watches the platform whisk by, keeping her eyes peeled, but she doesn't see the girl. \n6 OMITTED 6 \n7 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER - DAY 7 \nNina emerges from the subway station onto a city street. \nShe arrives at the MAJESTIC-LOOKING THEATER, where a few other BALLERINAS likewise trickle towards the entrance. They all look strangely similar: slender, carrying shoulder bags, wearing leggings and loose sweatshirts. \nShe passes a ROW OF POSTERS featuring the company's prima ballerina, BETH MACINTYRE. \nNina looks at them, a little envious, before continuing on to the STAGE DOOR. \n8 INT. SOLOIST DRESSING ROOM - DAY 8 \nCrammed into a single dressing room, Nina and the company's 5 SOLOISTS get ready for rehearsal. Chatting, sewing ribbon onto shoes, applying makeup, putting band-aids on blisters. \nNina removes a new pair of BALLET SHOES, admires them for a moment, before cutting off the satin toe with scissors. \nIn the background, catty VERONICA and Russian GALINA gossip. \nVERONICA Can't believe she's back. \nGALINA Of course she is. \nVERONICA She can't take a hint? Company's broke. No one comes to see her anymore. \nSOLOIST 1 No one comes to see ballet period. \nVERONICA That's not true, I heard the Royal had one of their best seasons yet. \nGALINA He needs to try something new. \nVERONICA No, someone new. \nSOLOIST 1 Like who? \nVERONICA Like someone who's not approaching menopause. \nThey snicker. \nNINA I think it's sad. \nVERONICA What's sad? \nNINA Beth's such an amazing dancer. \nGALINA So's my grand-mother. \nNINA Fonteyn danced into her 50's... \nVERONICA (ROLLING EYES) Yeah, we know. \nIrked, Nina starts POUNDING the shoes against the floor to soften the toe. \n", "test1_id": 1941, "test2_input": "Spotted, the figure backs up, seeming to disappear. \nNina cautiously approaches, but can't see anyone. \nShe gets closer to the doorway...and someone JUMPS OUT, startling her. \nIt's Beth, drunk and shivering. Cheeks streaked with mascara. \nNINA (CONT'D) Beth? What are you doing out here? \nBeth stares her down. Nina backs up, nervously grabbing her earlobe. \nNINA (CONT'D) I was crushed to hear that you're leaving. \nBETH What'd you do to get the role? \nNina shakes her head, confused. \nBETH (CONT'D) He always said you were a frigid little girl. \nHer words needle Nina, too close to the truth. \nBETH (CONT'D) So what did you do to make him change his mind? Suck his cock? \nNINA Some of us don't need to do that. \nNina's struck a nerve. Beth starts to come at her. \nBETH You fucking little whore. \nNINA (GUILTY) Beth, I'm- \nLEROY (O.S.) What's going on? \nThey both turn to see Leroy returned. \nBETH I need to talk to you. \nLEROY You're drunk. You should go home. \nBETH Don't do that! Don't just dismiss me! \nLEROY (EXASPERATED) Poor, poor little princess. Try to hold it together. \nBETH I'm going to drop by later, okay? I have something I want to give you. \nLEROY (IGNORING HER) Come on. \nHe puts his arm around Nina, starts to lead her away. \nBETH (O.S.) A token of my appreciation. \nHe ignores her and raises his arm to hail a cab. As they enter the cab, Beth calls after them. \nBETH (CONT'D) Make the most of it Nina. \nThrough the cab window Nina looks at Beth, troubled by her words. \n39 INT. LEROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 39 \nTasteful but spare loft. Modern and expensive furniture. Large windows. \nNina stands alone, looking around his inner sanctum, wide- eyed. \nShe explores the pieces of art, the furniture. She touches some of it, in awe. \nLEROY (O.S.) Here. \nShe turns, finds Leroy holding out yet another flute of champagne. For himself, a scotch. \nNINA Thanks. \nShe looks up at him, expecting him to make a move. Instead, he walks away, and sits in a chair. He gestures for her to sit as well. \nConfused, she sits across from him, alone on the large couch. \nHe takes an unceremonious sip of his drink and studies her. Uncomfortable, she takes a drink as well. \nLEROY I thought it'd be good to talk about the role. Ground us a little. \nNINA Yes. \nLEROY The better we get to know each other, the more productive we'll be. I don't want there to be any boundaries between us. \nNINA Me neither. \nLEROY Good. So, do you have a boyfriend? \nShe's caught off guard by his question and just smiles uncomfortably. He waits for an answer. Finally she manages a reply. \n", "test2_true": "LEROY Have you had many in the past? \nNINA A few. But no one serious. \nLEROY You're not a virgin, are you? \nHer expression sours at this line of questioning. She shakes her head. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Then there's nothing to be embarrassed about, is there? (she shakes her head) And you enjoy making love? \nNINA Excuse me? \nLEROY Sex. Do you enjoy it? \nBlushing and feeling awkward, she takes a sip of champagne. \nLEROY (CONT'D) We need to be able to talk about this. \nNINA Okay. \nLEROY So? \nNina looks at him, embarrassed, and shrugs. \nHe smirks, and joins her on the couch. \nLEROY (CONT'D) I have a homework assignment for you. \nNINA Yes? \nLEROY Go home and masturbate. Live a little. \nShe blanches, scandalized. He finishes off his scotch and stands. \nLEROY (CONT'D) It's late. Lots of work tomorrow. The doorman will find you a cab. \nHe leaves her alone in the living room. \n40 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 40 \nNina looks at herself in the mirror, removing bobbie-pins, as Erica folds clothing and puts it away. \nERICA Sounds like quite an evening. Wish I could have been there. \nNINA You know I asked. \nERICA I know, Susie told me. Guess he wanted you all to himself. \nNINA That's not why. \nErica looks adoringly at Nina's reflection in the mirror. \nERICA I don't blame him. \nErica starts to remove Nina's DIAMOND EARRINGS, but pauses. \nERICA (CONT'D) Where did you get these? \nNINA They're fake. \nERICA Fooled me. \nErica removes the earrings, then walks behind Nina to unzip her. Nina faces her. \nNINA I can do it. \nERICA Turn. \nNina turns back around, reticent. \nERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D) He must have been at your side all night, showing you off. \nErica finishes unzipping the red dress and sees Nina's shoulder. \nERICA (CONT'D) Oh Nina... \nRemembering, Nina pulls away from her. \nNINA It's just a rash. \nErica gruffly pulls Nina to the mirror and turns her around. \nERICA What are you talking about? \nNina checks her reflection and sees the RASH, red and irritated from scratching. \nNINA It was worse a couple days ago. It's already getting better. \nERICA You've been scratching again. \n", "test2_id": 1942, "test3_input": "Nina rifles through her dresser drawers. \nShe notices her mother sitting calmly. \nNINA Move. \nERICA Nina... \nNina grabs her by the wrist. \nERICA (CONT'D) Stop it. \nNINA You're crazy! \nERICA What happened to my sweet girl? \nNina yanks Erica off the chair onto the floor. \nNINA She's gone. \nERICA Please, you're not well. \nUnder the cushion Nina grabs the hidden brass DOORKNOB. \nErica lunges for her daughter's legs. \nNINA Let go! 87A. \nERICA You can't handle it! \nNINA I can't?! I'm the fucking swan queen! You never even got out of the corps. \nERICA You fucking ungrateful- \nNina jams the knob onto the post, opens the door. \nERICA (O.S.) (CONT'D) Don't leave! Nina! \n95 EXT. THEATER - EVENING 95 \nNina approaches the theater with harried steps. \nQuickly past the row of SWAN LAKE posters. \nShe reaches the side of the building, flings open the stage door and enters. \n96 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - EVENING 96 \nNina frantically makes her way down the bustling hallway, chaotic with dancers. Excitement in the air. \nShe nears the soloists' dressing room. \nJust outside of it, she spots a group of DANCERS excitedly chatting around a smiling Lily. \nNina stops in her tracks. \nLily glances in her direction, and her smile quickly fades into a sneer. \nLILY What are you doing here? \nThe other girls follow her gaze towards Nina, and their smiles turn to confusion. \nLEROY (O.S.) Nina? \nShe turns and finds that Leroy has approached from behind her. \nLILY You're supposed to be sick. \nLEROY Lily, give us a minute. \nLeroy pulls Nina towards her room. Lily glares at Nina as she passes. \n97 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 97 \nLeroy closes the door behind them. He looks at Nina, wheels spinning. \nLEROY Are you okay? \nNINA I'm fine. \nNina goes to her wardrobe, finds her two costumes hanging. One for the White Swan, one for the Black Swan. \nLEROY Nina? \nShe doesn't heed him, pulls out the White Swan leotard and sets it on her chair. \nLEROY (CONT'D) Nina! \nNINA What? \n", "test3_true": "NINA Fuck. Have you announced it? \nHe hasn't. \nNINA (CONT'D) After Beth, do you need more controversy? \nLeroy smirks at her directness. \nNINA (CONT'D) I'm here, Thomas. I'm doing it. \nHe looks at her, considering, and gives her a reluctant nod. She smiles. \nLEROY The only person standing in your way is you. It's time to let her go. Lose yourself. \nShe nods. He takes one last look at her and leaves. She breathes a sigh of relief. \nCurious, she cracks open the door and peeks outside: \n98 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY (NINA'S POV) 98 \nLeroy has pulled Lily down the corridor to break the news. Lily takes off, furious. \n99 OMITTED 99 \n100 INT. PRINCIPLE'S DRESSING ROOM - LATER 100 \nThrough the PA, music from ACT 1 plays. \nNina sits at her vanity in a robe, wearing the full White Swan makeup and FEATHER CROWN. Pale, with red lipstick and dark eyeliner, she looks like a porcelain doll. \nShe drops the robe off her shoulder and covers her rash with white makeup. \nThe STAGE MANAGER'S voice comes through the PA speaker: \nSTAGE MANAGER (V.O.) Act 2's starting. Ten minutes. \nShe removes a slipper off one foot. Her big and second toe, and her pinky and fourth toe are stuck together. Puzzled, she peels them apart. \nShe removes her other slipper and finds the same toes completely FUSED, forming two large toes with double toenails on either side of the middle toe. \nShe touches the bird-like foot, concerned, but slips on her tights and hides the feet. \n101 INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 101 \nNina stretches nervously in the wings, awaiting her entrance. \nShe peeks out through a small hole in the wall, sees the AUDIENCE sitting expectantly in their seats. \nThe music begins and they shift and mummer in anticipation. \nNina pulls away, taking deep breaths and clenching her hands, trying to stay calm. \nOn stage, David enters, beginning the Act. He traverses the stage, \"hunting\" with a crossbow. \nSTAGE MANAGER (TO NINA) Go. \nNina takes a last breath and runs on. \n102 STAGE 102 \nUnder the spotlight, she begins dancing her intro. \nDavid runs towards her and she startles away from him, afraid. \nHe grabs her and they begin their first Pas de Deux. \n103 INT. BACKSTAGE - LATER 103 \nNina comes offstage, catching her breath. All around her, CORPS MEMBERS dressed as little swans rush back on stage, where FOUR LITTLE SWANS begin the Pas de Quatre. \nNina looks into the opposite wing and sees Leroy watching her. He gives her a small, contented nod, then disappears behind a swarm of dancers. \nOn stage, the Four Little Swans perform. In their identical makeup and costumes, they look disturbingly alike. \nDuring the applause, Nina catches a glimpse of David backstage, sweaty, laughing and holding someone's hands. Nina can't see who, her view obscured by moving bodies and limbs. \nSuspicious, Nina moves to get a better look. \nRevealing that David's flirting with Lily. \nNina tenses. \nThen the Four Little Swans rush offstage past Nina. She watches them go, unsettled. \nSTAGE MANAGER What are you doing? You're on! \nHe gently nudges her, and she has to run back on. \n104 STAGE 104 \n", "test3_id": 1943}

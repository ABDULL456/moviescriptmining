LOU This is bullshit! I told you-- 
ADAM Wait a minute. Just tell him. 
NICK OK. You tell him, Adam. 
ADAM Sir, we... 
(EMBARRASSED) This is ridiculous. 
SCIENTIST Nothing's too ridiculous in the name of science. 
JACOB We're from the future. 
SCIENTIST Get the fuck out of here. 
EXT. IBM OFFICE PARK - LATE AFTERNOON 
A SECURITY GUARD escorts our guys out of the building. 
ADAM That went well. Lou starts walking off by himself. 
NICK 
(TO LOU) Where are you going? Lou points to his watch. 
LOU Five o'clock. Happy hour. The guys look at him, confused. 
LOU (CONT'D) If it's '87, the PF Chang's will be gone, which means the Brew Haus still stands. 
(THEN) It's Saturday. They have wet T- shirt contests on Saturdays. 
The guys' eyebrows raise. After a moment: 
ADAM Well, maybe one drink. Just to confirm. 
INT. BREW HAUS - HAPPY HOUR 
SPLASH! A WET T-SHIRT CONTEST is underway on a STAGE. Whitesnake on the juke, PAC MAN on the tables, and cheap beers in the mugs - this is an amazing brew pub. Our guys sit in the back, wearing PINE VALLEY LODGE shirts. There are MANY EMPTIES on the table and they look VERY DRUNK. In a roped-off area in the corner, a cocky YOUNGER PHIL (the one-armed bellhop) wields a CHAINSAW that he uses to carve an ICE SCULPTURE, impressing the bar crowd. He has BOTH ARMS. 
NICK Holy shit. It's that bellhop. 
JACOB Should we warn him? 
ADAM 
(COVERS EYES) I don't want to see this go down. Phil TOSSES THE CHAINSAW IN THE AIR and... He expertly CATCHES IT, seamlessly continuing to carve. A GIRL leans in and gives him a kiss. 
LOU Fuck that guy. ON THE STAGE, TWO GIRLS compete for wettest t-shirt. They both decide that NO T-SHIRT is the wettest option. 
NICK God bless our country. 
ADAM (in a daze) We're in 1987. 
JACOB You can stop saying that. I don't think it's making a difference. 
ADAM Seriously, we have to get back. (kinda losing it) We seriously have to get back! The guys subdue Adam, as a BIG-HAIRED WAITRESS brings drinks. 
WAITRESS Here ya go, guys. Three Buds, one Bartles and James. The guys all stare at her like she's a museum artifact. 
WAITRESS (CONT'D) What? I have lipstick on my teeth? Nick sips his WINE COOLER, feeling the eyes of the others on him. 
NICK Hey, if it's available, I'm ordering it. I always wanted one of these when I was little. The waitress puts down the CHECK. Jacob picks it up, realizing something. 
JACOB (to the waitress) Can you give us a second? She walks away, as Jacob turns to the guys.

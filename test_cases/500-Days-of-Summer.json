{"train": "500 DAYS OF SUMMER \nWritten by \nScott Neustadter & Michael H. Weber \nFirst Draft \nSIMPLE BLACK ON WHITE CREDITS ROLL TO BIG STAR'S \"I'M IN LOVE WITH A GIRL.\" When all is said and done, up comes a single number in parenthesis, like so: \nEXT. PARK - DAY \nFor a few seconds we watch A MAN (20s) and a WOMAN (20s) on a park bench. Their names are TOM and SUMMER. Neither one says a word. \nCLOSE ON her HAND, covering his. Notice the wedding ring. No words are spoken. Tom looks at her the way every woman wants to be looked at. \nA DISTINGUISHED VOICE begins to speak to us. \nNARRATOR This is a story of boy meets girl. \nCUT TO: \nINT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nThe boy is TOM HANSEN. He sits at a very long rectangular conference table. The walls are lined with framed blow-up sized greeting cards. Tom, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t- shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to balance out the corporate dress code. He looks pretty bored. \nNARRATOR The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met his... \"soulmate.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT LIVING ROOM - 1989 \nPRE-TEEN TOM sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie. His walls are covered in posters of obscure bands. From the TV, we hear: \"Elaine! Elaine!\" \nNARRATOR This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total misreading of the movie, \"The Graduate.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT OFFICE CUBICLE - PRESENT DAY \nThe girl is SUMMER FINN. She files folders and answers phones in a plain white office. She has cropped blonde hair almost like a boy's but her face is feminine and pretty enough to get away with it. \nNARRATOR The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief. \nCUT TO: \nINT BATHROOM - 1994 \nTeenage Summer stares at herself in the mirror. Her hair extends down to her lower back. \nNARRATOR Since the disintegration of her parents' marriage, she'd only loved two things. The first was her long blonde hair. \nShe picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice. \nNARRATOR The second was how easily she could cut it off... And feel nothing. \nCUT TO: \nSPLITSCREEN. INT BOARDROOM/ INT CUBICLE - SAME \nOn the right side of the screen, Tom continues to listen to some boring presentation. On the left, Summer answers a call, takes a message, and walks out of her cubicle down a long narrow hallway. \nNARRATOR Tom meets Summer on January 8th in a San Francisco office building. In an instant, he will know she's the one he's been looking for. \nCU Summer opening the door to the boardroom, about to come face to face with Tom for the first time. \nNARRATOR This is a story of boy meets girl. \nBut before they do, \nCUT TO: \nBLACK. \nNARRATOR You should know up front, this is not a love story. \nEXT STREETS OF SAN FRAN - NIGHT \nA 12 year old GIRL rides her bicycle down the block. She arrives at an apartment complex, jumps off the bike and races up the front stairs. She rings the doorbell. \nINT TOM'S PLACE - LATER \nPAUL and MCKENZIE open the door. These are Tom's best friends since birth. Paul is a doctor and wears hospital scrubs. McKenzie works in the cubicle next to Tom. \nINT DINER - NIGHT \nTom and Summer in a booth ordering dinner. \nTOM (to WAITRESS) Um...you know what...let's go crazy, I'll have BOTH. (to Summer) God, I love eating pancakes at night. It's like the greatest thing ever. How great is this? \nSUMMER I think we should stop seeing each other. \nINT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE \nRACHEL Just like that? \nTOM Just like that. \nPAUL Did she say why? \nINT DINER - AS BEFORE \nSUMMER This thing. This whatever it is. You and me. Do you think this is normal? \nTOM I don't know. Who cares about normal?! I'm happy. Aren't you happy? \nSUMMER You're happy? \nTOM You're not? \nSUMMER All we do is argue! \nTOM That is such a lie! \nINT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE \nRACHEL Maybe she was just in a bad mood. \nPAUL A hormonal thing. \nRACHEL P.M.S.? \nTOM (to Rachel) What do you know about PMS? \nRACHEL More than you. \nTOM Oh my god. \nMCKENZIE Please continue. \nINT DINER - AS BEFORE \nSUMMER This can't be a total surprise. I mean, we've been like Sid and Nancy for months. \nTOM Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven times with a kitchen knife. We've had some disagreements but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious. \nSUMMER No... I'm Sid. \nTOM (BEAT) So I'm Nancy?! \nThe Waitress comes out with the food. Tom and Summer stop their discussion until the meal is served and the Waitress leaves. Summer starts to eat. \nSUMMER Let's just eat and we'll talk about it after. I'm starving. \nWithout another word she goes back to her pancakes. Tom watches her eat like this is the worst travesty in the history of mankind. \nSUMMER (mouth full) Mmm, you're so right. These are great! \nTom looks at his food in disgust. He may never eat again. \nSUMMER (INNOCENT) What? \nTom stands up to go. \nSUMMER Tom, don't. Come back. You're still my best fr--- \nTHE SCENE FREEZES AND WE ZOOM IN ON TOM'S STUNNED FACE. \nINT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE \nSilence for a few beats. \nPAUL Jesus. \nMCKENZIE That's harsh. \nTOM I don't know what I'm gonna do. \nPAUL Oh shit. \nINT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nTom as we saw him earlier. Bored. In the boardroom. Mckenzie is in mid-presentation. \nMCKENZIE Now I know this may be a little risque...but if New Hampshire Greetings wants the jump on those conservative, right-wing neo-Nazis at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe is the wrong approach. The nuclear family is dead and we need a new holiday to recognize that. \nMckenzie holds up a home-made photoshopped family portrait of Martina Navratilova, Ellen DeGeneres, and the kid from \"Jerry Maguire\". \nMCKENZIE May 21st. Other Mother's Day. \nThe co-workers nod and digest this idea. VANCE is the head of the department. \nVANCE Hmmm. That's an intriguing idea McKenzie. Along with Grossman's \"Magellan Day\" I'd say we've got some potential here. What do you think Hansen? Could you write up some prototypes for these? \nTom is about to answer when... the door opens. \nSUMMER Excuse me, Mr. Vance? There's a call for you on line 3. \nAnd in walks this girl. Summer. We've met her by now but Tom hasn't. This is the first time. His eyes go wide and from that moment on, he can't take them off her. \nVANCE (to the table) Everyone this is Summer, my new assistant. Summer just moved here from... \nSUMMER Michigan. \nVANCE Right. Michigan. Well, Summer, everyone. Everyone, Summer. Excuse me, I have to take this. \nSUMMER Nice to meet you all. \nSummer gives a little wave before following Vance out. \nShe doesn't notice Tom whose face looks like he's just seen God. \nINT. OFFICE - DAY \nTom trying to work. And failing. He turns to McKenzie. \nTOM What do we know about this new girl? \nMCKENZIE Who? \nTOM The new girl. Summer. In Vance's office. \nMCKENZIE Dude. I hear she's a bitch from hell! \nTOM (DISAPPOINTED) Really? \nMCKENZIE Patel tried to talk to her in the copy room. She was totally not having it. \nTOM Maybe she was just in a hurry. \nMCKENZIE And maybe she's some uppity, better than everyone, superskank. \nTOM Damn. \nMCKENZIE I know. She's pretty hot. \nTOM That makes me so mad! Why is it pretty girls always think they can treat people like crap and get away with it? \nMCKENZIE Dunno. \nTOM Like, just cause she has high cheekbones and soft skin... \nMCKENZIE ...and really good teeth. \nTOM And maybe the world's most perfect breasts...Just cause of that stuff, she can walk around like she's center of the universe? \nMCKENZIE (as explanation) Women. \nTOM Ugh. You know what? Screw her! We haven't even met and I can't stand her already. \nINT. ELEVATOR - LATER \nTom is listening to headphones. Summer enters the elevator and Tom actively puts on a show to ignore her. Summer hears the music. \nSUMMER The Smiths. \nTom, pretending not to hear or care, gives her an unenthusiastic wave. \nSUMMER I love The Smiths. \nTom, still pretending, takes off his headphones. \nTOM And it turns out she's read every Graham Greene novel ever published. Her desk is lined with Magritte posters and Edward Hopper. \nRACHEL Your favorites. \nTOM We're so compatible it's insane! Seriously! It doesn't make sense! She's not like I thought at all. She's... amazing. \nRACHEL Oh boy. \nTOM What? \nRACHEL You know...just cause some cute girl likes the same bizarro music you do doesn't make her \"the one.\" \nTOM (BEAT) Of course it does. \nSARAH (O.S.) Dinner! \nSARAH, 50s, Tom and Rachel's mother, stands in the doorway. \nSARAH Pause and come eat. \nThey do. Tom enters the living room area and sits down next to his stepdad MARTIN, 60s, a quiet, professorial Southern gentleman type. \nTOM Hey Martin. \nANGLE ON RACHEL and Sarah. \nRACHEL He met a girl. \nSARAH (EXCITED) Yeah? \nRACHEL (GRIM) Yeah. \nSarah grows serious too. \nSARAH Oh shit. \nCUT TO: \nSTOCK FOOTAGE. \nThe Wright Brothers, Galileo, Heaven's Gate, Neil Armstrong. \nNARRATOR When one strongly believes in something, it takes overwhelming contradictory evidence to change their minds. \nEND ON: \nLITTLE TOM, age 6, mesmerized by a vinyl album cover of Olivia Newton-John in \"Xanadu.\" \nNARRATOR Tom had always been a devout believer in the idea of \"true love.\" (BEAT) The evidence did not support him. \nCUT TO: \nINT CLASSROOM - DAY \nLittle Tom stares at a LITTLE GIRL, 6, who has the same hairstyle and dress as Newton-John on that cover. Tom draws a picture. It's a boy and a girl with a giant heart over them. \nHe stands up and walks over to the girl, putting the picture on her desk. Not a word is spoken. Satisfied, he returns to his seat and waits to see what happens. \nNARRATOR Exhibit A: Lisa Rayner. \nThe Little Girl stands up and walks the picture over to ANOTHER BOY. \nTom is mortified. The OTHER BOY eats the drawing. \nEXT FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT \nA BLONDE CHEERLEADER leads the crowd in a cheer. PAN ACROSS to find TEENAGE TOM, 15, finishing making out with a homely HIGH SCHOOL GIRL. He says goodbye and walks off, looking back longingly. \nNARRATOR Exhibit B: Wendy Wilson. \nOnce Tom is out of frame, a SECOND BOY approaches Wendy. Then they start making out. \nINT AIRPLANE - DAY \nCOLLEGE TOM sits next to his girlfriend REBECCA MYLES. His smile gleams. \nTOM I'm so glad we decided to go away together Bec. I know we've only been dating a few months but it's been...awesome. \nNARRATOR Exhibit C: Rebecca Myles. \nTOM And now, you and me, 8 days in Mexico... best spring break ever! \nAcross the aisle Rebecca makes eye contact with three COLLEGE DUDES. \nINT LOCAL DIVE BAR - AS BEFORE \nThe friends wait for more. \nTOM You believe that shit? \nMCKENZIE What shit? \nPAUL I think I missed something. \nTOM \"It was good.\" She didn't say \"It was good.\" She said \"It was good.\" Emphasis on the good. She basically said \"I spent the weekend having sex with this guy I met at the gym.\" Fucking whore. Screw her. It's over. \nEveryone's silent. \nMCKENZIE What the hell is wrong with you?! \nPAUL Dude, you got problems. \nTOM She's not interested in me. There's nothing I can do. \nMCKENZIE Based on...\"it was good?\" TOM And some other things. \nPAUL Like what, she said \"hey\" instead of \"hi\" cause that totally means she's a lesbian. \nTOM I gave her all sorts of chances. \nINT OFFICE - DAY \nTom types at his desk. Summer approaches the cubicle Tom shares with McKenzie. \nSUMMER I'm going to the supply room. Anyone need anything? \nMCKENZIE No thanks. \nTOM I think you know what I need. \nThere's a beat. \nTOM Toner. \nSUMMER Oh ok, sure, no prob. \nINT OFFICE - LATE IN THE DAY \nThe office is emptying out. Only a few people remain but Tom and Summer are two of them. Tom takes this opportunity to put a CD in his computer and play the song really loud. It's \"I Want to Know What Love Is\" by Foreigner. No reaction from Summer. Tom turns it up. Still nothing. Tom turns it down, defeated. \nINT SUMMER'S DESK \nTom is there. \nTOM Do you want to go out with me? \nA beat. Summer says nothing. \nTOM And the Priest says, \"But we're already out!\" \nThey both laugh. \nSUMMER That is hilarious! \nTOM I know! \nAnd when she walks away, he smacks his head a few times with his palm. \nINT LOCAL DIVE BAR - AS BEFORE \nTOM Not once did she take the bait. Not once. Screw it. I'm done with her. It's over. \nTom's friends all look at him like he's crazy. \nINT OFFICE - TOM'S CUBICLE - DAY \nTom sits at his desk with headphones on trying to work. But with Summer down at the end of the hall, he's having a hard time concentrating. \nMcKenzie shares a cubicle with Tom. \nMCKENZIE This Friday. 10 bucks all you can karaoke at The Well. \nTOM No way McKenzie. Absolutely not. \nMCKENZIE Come on! (SINGING) \"Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and they got big titties!\" \nTOM They won't let you back in there after last time. \nSUMMER No, I'm not a lesbian. I'm just not comfortable being somebody's \"girlfriend.\" I don't want to be anybody's anything, you know? MCKENZIE I have no idea what you're talking about. \nSUMMER It sounds selfish, I know, but... I just like being on my own. Relationships are messy and feelings are always getting hurt. Who needs all that? We're young. We're in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. (MORE) \nSUMMER (cont'd) I say, let's have as much fun as we can afford and leave the serious shit for later. \nTOM But...what if you meet someone and fall in love? \nSUMMER (LAUGHS) Love? You seriously believe in that stuff? \nTOM Of course I do. \nSUMMER Interesting. A real romantic. \nMCKENZIE Oh you have no idea. This one... embarrassing. There was this one girl, (to Tom) I gotta tell this story -- \nTom elbows McKenzie hard in the ribs to shut him up. \nTOM Summer, hold on... you don't believe in love? \nSUMMER I don't even know what that word means. I know I've never felt it, whatever it is in all those songs. And I know that today most marriages end in divorce. Like my parents. \nTOM Well mine too but -- \nSUMMER Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek, there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make a person fall in \"love\" with a rock. Is that the love you're talking about? \nTOM Well... \nSUMMER Why, what's your take on it? \nCUT TO: \nAN ANIMATION SEQUENCE, real quick. AN EXPLOSION OF MANY DIFFERENT COLORS, COMPLETE WITH A CHOIR AND A CHURCH ORGAN ALL BUILDING TO A HUGE CRESCENDO. \nBACK TO: \nINT BAR \nOn Tom: \nTOM I think it's...kind of a huge thing. \nSUMMER (BEAT) Ok. Looks like we're gonna have to agree to disagree on that one. \nMcKenzie senses some discontent. \nMCKENZIE So, uh, who's singing next? \nSUMMER (re: singing) I'd say it's your turn loverboy. \nTOM Nooo. I don't sing in public. \nSUMMER Sure you do. I see you lip-synching to your headphones every morning on your way in. \nTOM I don't... \nMCKENZIE You really do. \nSUMMER It's ok. I like it. Takes a lot of self-confidence to look ridiculous. \nMCKENZIE (can't help himself) Self-confidence! Ha! \nTom elbows him in the ribs again. \nTOM Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people. \nSUMMER Ok then. Let's drink. \nTOM It would take at least ten shots to get me to sing. \nSUMMER Bartender! \nTEN MINUTES LATER. Tom is up there singing The Clash's \"Magnificent Seven.\" You wouldn't think so but Tom is a ROCK STAR up there! He's dancing like Jagger, he's got everyone in the bar singing along to the audience-participation parts. It's a sight to behold. Summer is all smiles watching. \nLATER. Tom and Summer back at the table. Summer is humming something. \nTOM That's not it. \nSUMMER What is that then? \nTOM I have no idea. \nThey're both having a good time. \nTom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go the other way. \nTOM (under his breath) Friends. Awesome. That's just great. Well done Hansen, you idiot. \nTom walks a few more steps. \nAnd then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even noticing, SUMMER HAS WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PULLED HIM INTO A KISS! \nIt's unbelievable. There's a few seconds where Tom isn't sure if he's dreaming or not. But then he realizes, suddenly, out of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually happening. \nFADE UP: \"YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE\" by Hall and Oates. \nEXT STREET - MORNING \nIt's the greatest morning of all time! \nTom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom struts down the street. He's pointing at people as he passes, winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back. \nPeople wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up. A parade forms behind him. The POSTMAN, a POLICE OFFICER, the HOT DOG VENDOR, RONALD MCDONALD and MAYOR MCCHEESE, everybody loves Tom today. HALL and OATES themselves walk with Tom singing the song. \nCars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by. The DRIVERS also pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up every time he touches the pavement like in \"Billie Jean\". \nCARTOON BIRDS fly onto Tom's shoulder. He smiles and winks at them. \nINT OFFICE - SAME \nTom passes Summer's office whistling Hall and Oates. She sees him and immediately lights up. \nSUMMER Hey! \nTOM Hey! \nVance pokes out of his corner office. \nVANCE. Summer, I need -- Oh hello Hansen. \nTOM Hey Mr. Vance. \nSUMMER Yes, Mr. Vance? \nAnd they're all business. As Tom turns to go, however, Summer gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make anyone's day complete. Tom gives her the international signal for `I'll call you later' in return. Vance sees none of it. Tom walks to his cubicle, still on top of the world. \nINT TOM'S PLACE - THAT NIGHT \nTom answers the door. It's Paul (in hospital scrubs). \nPAUL You son of a bitch. \nHe walks inside without waiting for an invite. \nPAUL Last night, karaoke night? \nTOM (ANXIOUS) Shhh. \nPAUL The same girl you'd been whining and crying and bitching about for weeks now? \nTOM I have not been... \nPAUL The same girl you said was way out of your league and you'd have no chance with no matter what. That girl? \nTOM Paul, seriously... \nPAUL Did you bang her? \nTOM No! \nPAUL Blow job? \nTOM No! \nPAUL Hand job? \nTOM No, Paul, no jobs. I'm still unemployed. We just kissed. \nPAUL Come on, level with me. As your best friend, who tolerated a whole month of talk talk talk about this girl, nothing but Summer this, Summer that, Summer Summer Summer, I mean you were practically stalking her... \nTOM Shhh! \nSuddenly, the sound of a toilet flushing is heard. From the bathroom emerges Summer, dressed to go out. \nPAUL Oh crap. \nSUMMER Hi, I'm Summer.. \nSUMMER Let's just have fun. Let's just...hang out, no pressure, no labels, no obligations. (BEAT) Ok? \nTom is visibly disappointed by this but he tries to hide it. \nTOM Sure. \nSUMMER (BEAT) Wanna hold my hand under the table? \nA beat. \nTOM Yeah. \nINT TOM'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nSummer and Tom come bounding in, lip-locked and all over each other. They fall on his bed and begin undressing each other. Suddenly, Tom stops. \nTOM I'll be...back in a sec. \nHe walks into the hallway, out of her sight. He looks into the hallway mirror. \nTOM Settle. Don't get too excited. She's just a girl. There's lots of them. Who look like that. And like what you like. They're everywhere. Calm yourself. \nHe takes a few deep breaths. \nTOM Are you calm? (BEAT) Ok. Then it's time to go back in. \nWe watch from behind as he re-enters his bedroom. Where Summer waits. Under the covers. Naked. \nSUMMER Hi. \nTOM Oh sweet Jesus! \nTom can't help but do a little celebration dance. \nCUT TO: \nLATER. Sex has been had. Summer is asleep. Tom lies next to her. He still can't help but be ecstatic. He is pumping his fists in the air and silently shouting \"Woo Hoo!!!!\" \nCU - TOM. LOOKING THE WORSE FOR WEAR. UNSHAVEN, LONG HAIR, CRUMPLED CLOTHING. IN SHORT, HE'S A MESS. \nTOM (into CAMERA) I fucking hate Summer. \nCU - SUMMER'S SMILE (as before) \nTOM (V.O.) I hate her crooked teeth. \nCU - SUMMER'S HAIR (as before) \nTOM (V.O.) I hate her 1950s haircut. \nCU - SUMMER'S KNEES (as before) \nTOM (V.O.) I hate her knobby knees. \nCU - SUMMER'S EYES (as before) \nTOM (V.O.) I hate her lopsided, asymmetrical, cock-eyed head. \nCU - SUMMER'S NECK (as before) \nTOM (V.O.) I hate that centipede-shaped scar. \nCU - SUMMER'S BREASTS (as before) \nTOM (V.O.) I hate her...stupid...big boobs. \nCU - SUMMER ASLEEP (as before) \nTOM (V.O.) I hate the way she sleeps. \nCU - SUMMER'S LAUGH \nTOM (V.O.) I hate the way she laughs. \nOVER BLACK, play the middle 8 of \"Every Little Thing She Does is Magic.\" \nTOM (V.O.) I HATE THIS FUCKING SONG! \nCU - TOM. \nREVERSE ANGLE on A TROLLEY FULL OF PEOPLE, terrified of this raving lunatic. \nBUS DRIVER Son, you're gonna have to exit the vehicle. \nTOM See this beam, it steps on the landscape. But if we moved it... just so... \nEXT OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nTom and Summer, who have ridden together to work, stand outside the building. \nSUMMER You wanna -- \nTOM No you go first. \nSUMMER It doesn't matter to me. \nTOM Whatever you want. \nA CO-WORKER passes. \nCO-WORKER Hey Summer. Tom. \nBOTH (like nothing's up) Hey./ Hi. \nSummer joins the co-worker and walks in. \nSUMMER (to Co-Worker) So how's it going? \nShe turns back to look at Tom on the way. She sticks out her tongue to be cute. Co-Worker doesn't see. Tom is crazy about her. \nINT OFFICE - LATER \nTom at his cubicle with the one architecture sketch. The phone rings and he picks it up. \nTOM Hello? \nSUMMER (V.O.) I remember! \nINT COPY ROOM - DAY \nSummer is on her cell phone in the office copy room. She begins to sing the theme song to \"The A-Team.\" \nTOM (V.O.) That's it! \nMcKenzie enters and sees her singing into the phone. Turns without a word and leaves. \nINT TOM'S CUBICLE - SAME \nTom listening to her sing. McKenzie comes over. \nMCKENZIE Your girl is losing it. \nTom is too wrapped up in the phone call to acknowledge him. The smile on his face is the biggest we've seen yet. \nINT. SHOWER - LATER \nWe just see the curtain, but we can see their silhouettes behind it. Summer and Tom are trying to have sex in the shower. They're trying to stable themselves, grip something so as not to fall, elbows are flying, it's a mess. \nSUMMER This is not at all as easy as it looks. \nTOM Ow! \nThe curtain rips and the bar comes crashing down. They fall on top of each other laughing. \nINT VIRGIN MEGASTORE - NIGHT \nTom and Summer wander through the aisles. \nTOM There's no way. \nSUMMER Why not? \nTOM \"Octopus's Garden?\" You may as well just say \"Piggies?\" \nSUMMER I told you. I love Ringo. \nTOM You're insane. \nSUMMER Why? \nTOM Cause nobody loves Ringo. \nSUMMER That's what I love about him. (BEAT) Ooh. \nSummer drags Tom into the curtained-off \"Porn\" section. She picks up a box. \nSUMMER (FLIRTATIOUS) This got great reviews. \nSUMMER On some. \nTOM I like how you dress. \nSUMMER Yeah? What if I started wearing berets and got a huge butterfly tattoo on my leg? \nTOM (BEAT) Please don't. \nA tall, well-built, GOOD-LOOKING DOUCHEBAG GUY has suddenly appeared next to them. \nDOUCHE (to Summer) Hey. \nTom and Summer stop talking. \nSUMMER Hey. \nDOUCHE How's it going? \nSUMMER Ok. \nTom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange go down. Not sure what else to do. At this point he's more amused than concerned. \nDOUCHE You live around here? \nSUMMER Yeah not too far. \nDOUCHE I've never seen you here before. \nSUMMER You're not too perceptive. \nDOUCHE Ha. That's funny. \nTom smiles to himself. This guy's a tool. Nothing to worry about. \nDOUCHE So, uh, let me buy you a drink. \nSUMMER No thank you. \nAs she answers Summer gives a quick glance over to Tom. The Guy notices. Up to this point he had not connected the two of them together. \nDOUCHE Are you with this guy? \nTom realizes he has to sort of say something now. \nTOM (BEAT) Hi. I'm Tom. \nDOUCHE Whatever. (to Summer) Come on, one drink. What are you drinking? \nSUMMER Sorry, no thank you. \nTom is pleased. \nDOUCHE You're serious? This guy? \nAnd now he's pissed. \nTOM Hey buddy -- \nSUMMER (to the Douche) Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm just not interested. Now why don't you go back over there and leave us alone, ok? \nDOUCHE It's a free country. \nSummer and Tom make eye contact again, as if to say \"now what?\" After a beat: \nDOUCHE So you and him, huh? I can't believe that. Is this guy really your boyfriend? \nAnd that question hangs in the air. Tom, panicked, decides to cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion, coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost automatic RIGHT CROSS TO THE GOOD LOOKING DOUCHEBAG'S FACE. \nWhich connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling. \nBoth Douche and Tom wince at the pain (Douche's chin, Tom's fist). \nThere's a beat of calm where Tom is actually sorta surprised. And then the Douche spins around and starts PUMMELLING TOM. \nCUT TO: \nEXT BAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nHaving been thrown out, Summer and Tom exit the place. Tom is a bloody mess, granted, but feels pretty great about it. \nTOM Did you see that punch? I don't know where it came from. I haven't punched someone since Josh Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm gonna have to throw out this shirt. \nSummer starts walking ahead and Tom notices for the first time she's furious. \nRight: Summer looks at her phone, willing it to ring. It doesn't. \nINT TOM'S BEDROOM - HOURS LATER \nTom is awakened by a buzzer. He hits the \"sleep\" button but the buzzing isn't coming from his alarm. It's his door. He gets up, concerned, and goes to answer it. It's Summer. \nSUMMER Say you're sorry. \nTOM Huh? \nSUMMER Say you're sorry for acting like a jerk. \nTOM I am. I'm sorry for acting like a jerk. \nSUMMER Ok. Me too. \nTOM Summer... we don't have to label what we're doing. I just... I need - \nSUMMER I know - \nTOM Consistency. I need to know you won't wake up tomorrow and feel a different way. \nSUMMER I can't promise you that. Nobody can. Anyone who does is a liar. \nA beat. \nSUMMER I can only tell you how I feel right now... or I can show you. \nShe comes in and kisses him. He thinks about it for a second. Is this enough to assuage his doubts? Damn it, she wins again. He shuts the door in our faces. \nINT TOM'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING \nTom and Summer in the wee hours. \nTOM Have you ever had a real \"boyfriend?\" \nSUMMER What? \nTOM A boyfriend. \"Going steady.\" Whatever. You know what I mean. \nSUMMER Well... yeah. \nTOM More than one? \nSUMMER A few. \nTOM Tell me about them. \nSUMMER Oh no way. \nTOM Why? \nSUMMER Cause there's nothing to tell. \nTOM Come on, I'm interested. \nSUMMER You wanna have the relationship history conversation? \nTOM Yes. \nSUMMER You sure about that? \nTOM No. Yeah. I don't know. Why not? I can take it. \nSUMMER Ok. Well, in high school, there was Markus. \nINSERT: Still photograph of MARKUS. Or at least how he appears in Tom's mind. Arm cocked, about to throw the winning touchdown pass. \nTOM Quarterback slash homecoming king? \nSUMMER He was a rower. Very hot. \nTOM What happened to Markus? \nSUMMER He works for the Republican party. Very successful. Just not for me. \nTOM Ok. And then? \nSUMMER Well, for a short time in college, there was Kurt. \nINSERT: Still photograph of KURT. As Tom envisions him. Playing the guitar on stage in Motley Crue. \nSUMMER That didn't really go anywhere. (BEAT) And... my semester in Rome. Daniele Belardelli. AKA \"The Puma.\" \nEXT TRANSAMERICA BUILDING - (BACK ON DAY 51) \nSummer and Tom stand on the street corner looking at the buildings. \nTOM A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that. \nTom keeps talking. Summer turns and looks directly at the CAMERA. \nSUMMER While you continue to talk about buildings and whatever other bullshit interests you, I'll just nod my head and pretend to listen while secretly dreaming about the many ways I can one day rip out your heart and eat it like the rabid vampire I am. \nINT RESTAURANT - SAME \nTom and Alison. \nTOM Maybe there were things I could have said or done, you know? \nINT SUMMER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - (FROM DAY 39) \nFrom the scene in which Tom and Summer first slept together. He's sleeping like a baby, probably the best sleep he's had in a long while. Summer lies next to him. Wide awake. Bored and unfulfilled. \nINT RESTAURANT - SAME \nTom and Alison. Alison is desperately trying to get a drink. \nALISON Waiter! \nTOM Or... Christ, I don't know, maybe she was never that interested in me to begin with. \nINT ELEVATOR - DAY - (FROM DAY 22) \nTom and Summer ride in silence for a few beats. \nTOM (BEAT) How was your weekend? \nSUMMER (winks at him) It was good. \nINT RESTAURANT - SAME \nTOM Anyway... sorry. If I'm acting strange, that's why. \nALISON It's ok. I'm sure it's tough getting over an ex-girlfriend. \nTOM Actually she was never my girlfriend. \nNow Alison is really confused. And it's right around the part where Tom starts totally cracking up. \nTOM I just... I thought I'd have figured it out by now, you know? My life. Where I'm going, where I want to end up, who with. All that stuff. I still don't know anything. And the thing is... When I was with Summer, none of that mattered. I never even noticed how much of my life was missing! Isn't that weird? \nALISON You were in love, that's what it does. But, now that you know where the holes are you can start to fill them. \nTOM Sure. (BEAT) Hey, I've been talking non-stop. You talk. \nALISON Me? Well I grew up -- \nTOM So what do you think? Did I do something? Did I not do something? What can I do now? \nALISON I... (BEAT) (MORE) \nALISON (cont'd) You wanna get out of here? I know this great... \nTOM (suddenly excited) Oh! You know what we should do... \nINT KARAOKE BAR - LATER \nTom is, yes, on stage singing another song by The Clash, \"Train in Vain.\" Not so much singing as having a nervous breakdown to music. \nTOM \"You said you'd stand by your man!/So tell me something I don't understand. You said you loved me!/And that's a fact! And then you left me, said you felt trapped! \nAlison sits by herself in a booth trying to hide her face. \nTOM \"You didn't stand by me! Not at all! You didn't stand by me,\" I'm talking about you Summer! \nOn Alison, having the worst date ever. \nCUT TO: \nINT TOM'S BATHROOM - NIGHT \nTom is getting dressed for a big fancy night out. A punkish pop song plays in the b.g. that he occasionally boogies down to. He's excited. \nHe tucks his shirt into his pants. He ties his tie. He brushes his teeth with aplomb. He looks for, finds, and plucks a grey hair from his head. He makes some faces into the mirror. \nSatisfied, he grabs his coat and hits the street. \nSUMMER Then why are you here? \nTOM This is what you wanted to do so...we're doing it. \nSUMMER Yeah well, I didn't need a chaperone. Go home. You're a buzzkill standing there pouting. \nTOM (HURT) That's real nice. \nHe walks off. She feels some guilt for a second. \nSUMMER Tom! \nBut when he doesn't turn around she just shakes it off and starts dancing again. \nLATER. Tom is outside in the rain. We can still hear the music blaring from the club. Summer is in there. Tom is alone. He can't believe it's come to this. \nFADE UP: \"YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE\" by Hall and Oates. \nEXT STREET - MORNING \nThe worst morning ever. \nTom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom sulks down the street. Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad, broken man and the world is an awful place. There's still Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up. He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard's brother Clint looks back. \nTom walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces. \nHe walks by a sign that says \"TODAY ONLY: FREE BEER.\" He doesn't even stop. \nCartoon Bird returns but Tom swats it away. \nThe WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for directions. He doesn't even look up. \nTom's parade of supporters, The Postman, Mayor McCheese, all of them shake their heads and give him disapproving looks. The Cartoon Bird takes a cartoon shit on Tom's shoulder. Tom tries to kill the bird. Can't even manage that. \nINT OFFICE - SAME \nHe passes Summer desk on the way in. She's no longer there. He miserably sits down at his desk, tries to work but he ends up just staring into space. \nINT VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY \nTom has been called into the Principal's office. \nTOM You wanted to see me, Mr. Vance? \nVANCE Yes Hansen. Sit down. \nTOM Ok. \nVANCE. Has something happened to you recently? \nTOM What do you mean? \nVANCE A death in the family, someone taken ill...anything like that? \nTOM No. \nVANCE Look, I don't mean to pry. Does this have something to do with Summer leaving. \nTOM Who? \nVANCE. My assistant. \nTOM (faking badly) Your...? \nVANCE. Tom...everyone knows. Nevermind. The reason I'm asking... lately your work performance has been... a little off. \nTOM I'm not following. \nVANCE For example, here's something you wrote last week... (reads from a card on his DESK) \"Roses are Red, Violets are Blue. Fuck You Whore.\" Now...most shoppers on Valentine's Day --- \nTOM Mr. Vance... are you firing me? \nVANCE No, no, no. Relax Hansen. You're one of our most... adequate writers. \nTOM Ok. Well, I'm sorry. Things for me have been a little difficult. \nVANCE That's ok. I understand that. I was just thinking... perhaps you could channel your energy into... this. \nHe hands him some sympathy cards. \nTOM Funerals and sympathy? \nVANCE Misery, sadness, loss of faith, no reasons to live... it's perfect for you. Whaddaya say? Good? Good. Now back to work you go. \nTom sees a COUPLE kissing on the sidewalk. He winces. He sees ANOTHER COUPLE entwined on a bench. It's killing him. He sees a THIRD COUPLE walking towards him holding hands. He snaps. \nTOM Jesus Christ people! Get a room! \nThey look at this lunatic in his robe and quickly walk away. \nINT TOM'S BEDROOM \nAlarm clock. We PAN ACROSS to see Tom is wide awake. He probably hasn't slept in a day or so. He has no reaction to the alarm. \nINT OFFICE - LATER \nTom actually wanders in to work, wearing sunglasses and the clothes he slept in. People pass and say hello. He can't muster responses. At his desk, \nMCKENZIE Tom! \nNothing. \nMCKENZIE I've been calling every five minutes. Are you ok? \nTOM What? Oh yeah. Great. \nMCKENZIE Do you need anything? \nTOM Twinkies? \nMCKENZIE Sorry. \nTOM I'm out of twinkies. \nMCKENZIE Well let's go. \nTOM Go... where? \nMCKENZIE It's Thursday. \nINT BOARDROOM - LATER \nTom sits next to McKenzie and across from Vance. He's in his usual boardroom position, which is to say, near comatose. \nA female CO-WORKER, 50s, stands at the front of the room in mid-presentation, showing slides that have something to do with a cat in various poses. First we see, \"Cat Reaching Up for Out-of-Reach Milk Bowl.\" \nCO-WORKER This one says \"Go for it!\" \nShe clicks to the next slide. \"Cat Hanging From Tree Branch.\" \nCO-WORKER This one says \"Don't give up!\" \nClick. We see \"Cat Considering a Giant Leap.\" \nCO-WORKER And this one says \"You can do it!\" We have a whole line of inspirational cards featuring Pickles, my cat. I think people will really enjoy them. Thank you. \nShe takes her seat. \nVANCE. Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really inspirational stuff. Now, who's next. We haven't heard from \"Sympathy\" in a while. Hansen... \nTOM (reacting to his name) Hmm? \nVANCE. The Winter collection. You have anything to contribute? \nTOM Uh...no. I really don't. \nVANCE. You have nothing? \nTOM Well I wouldn't say nothing... Actually, that's about right. \nVANCE. (DISAPPOINTED) Oh...k. We'll come back to you. McKenzie -- \nTOM You know what...? \nVANCE. Yes Tom. \nTOM Can I say something about the cat? \nVANCE Well sure. Go ahead. \nTOM This here is, and Rhoda, you know I mean no disrespect... but this... this is total shit. \nMCKENZIE Tom! \nTOM \"Don't give up?\" \"You can do it?\" \nHe points to the screen, still showing the \"Cat About to Leap\" image. \nTOM (LYING) Sure. \nRACHEL Tom. \nTOM Hmm? \nRACHEL I know you think she was the perfect girl for you... (BEAT) I don't. I think you're just remembering the good stuff. But what do I know, right? I'm 13. \nShe blows him a kiss and then runs off and joins her girls. Tom watches her go. \nCUT TO: \nSPLITSCREEN - TOM'S BEDROOM/ SUMMER'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nTom is wide-awake, sitting fully dressed on his bed putting his shoes on. He holds the phone up to his ear. \nTOM Hey. \nSummer is half-asleep under the covers. The phone lays at her side and she angles towards it. \nSUMMER Hello? \nTOM Are you still sleeping? \nSUMMER (GROGGY) I'm getting up. What time is it? \nTOM 10:30. Are we still hanging out today? \nSUMMER Ok. Sure. \nTOM I'll meet you at Liberty in... 20 minutes? \nSUMMER I might need 45. \nEXT PARK - DAY \nTom and Summer are having a picnic. If it looks familiar, it's cause we saw them here on page 7. This is that fateful day Tom described to his sister and his friends. The day it all, finally, fell apart. \nTOM So how was last night? \nSUMMER It was fine. Just a work thing. \nTOM Where did you guys go? \nSUMMER Some restaurant. \nTOM Fun? \nSUMMER Uneventful. Didn't get home until after 12 though which is way too late for a stupid work function. How was your night? \nTOM Pretty standard. \nNot much more to say. Stay with them for a few extra beats of silence. \nEXT OUTDOOR MARKET - LATER \nTom and Summer shopping at the fruit market. Unless we were looking for trouble we wouldn't see any. But since we are, we might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the aisles. His hands are in his pockets. He's bored. She's distant. But only if we're really looking. \nINT. APARTMENT - LATER \nTom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment again. We see him rearranging the furniture in the room. \nLATER. He hangs some new pictures. \nLATER. He uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf. Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. He draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail something. \nINT COFFEE HOUSE - LATER \nThat day again. As we've seen before, Tom reads a newspaper. Summer reads a novel. \nTOM It's playing at 5. \nSUMMER You want to go? \nTOM I don't know. You wanna maybe go back to your place or --- \nSUMMER I want to see it. Let's go. \nTOM Ok cool. \nSUMMER Unless you don't want to. \nTOM No, I will. That's fine. \nTOM Let's get breakfast. \nSUMMER Now? \nTOM Pancakes? \nSummer's resistance is futile. And the rest as they say is history. \nFADE UP: \"Number Two\" by the Pernice Brothers. Which plays OVER: \n1. INT TOM'S BATHROOM - DAY \nTom shaves. Makes himself look presentable. \nLATER. Tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while holding a phone with the other. \n2. EXT CITY SIDEWALK - DAY \nTom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the city's skyline. \n2. INT LIBRARY - DAY \nTom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears, reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building design. \n3. INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY \nTom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the lobby of a high-rise. \n4. EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY \nTom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him. \n6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY \nTom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of futuristic looking structures). He crosses \"Abrams and Abrams\" off the list. We notice several others are also crossed off. \n5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY \nTom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring the distance between the beams of the bridge. \n8. EXT PARK - DAY \nTom jogs. A little faster this time. \n9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTom getting more bad news from the answering machine, crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost in thought. \nThen, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were, he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness. \n9. SPLITSCREEN - DAY \nOn the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window. Thinking. \nOn the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is lifted. And she's a bride. \nEND MUSIC. \nEXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY \nTom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took Summer ages ago. \nEXT. PARK - DAY \nTom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice. \nSUMMER (V.O.) Hey. \nSummer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours. Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to do. \nSUMMER (re: suit) Where you coming from? \nTOM What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have you been sitting there? \nSUMMER Awhile. \nTom finds it hard to look at her. \nSUMMER I come here a lot. I always loved this place, ever since you brought me here. \nThe mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty. \nTOM So... I should probably say congratulations. \nSummer takes a beat to let this hang there. \nSUMMER I was right? \nAnd then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh. \nTOM What? This is funny? \nTries to stop but it only makes it worse. Now's she's completely cracking up. \nTOM What are you laughing at? \nAnd she can't stop. She's totally lost control. \nTOM (trying himself not to LAUGH) You're a crazy person! \nSUMMER Tom! You're the crazy person! \nTOM What are you talking about?! \nSUMMER One day I'm reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it. Now he's my husband! \nTOM This is funny to you? \nSUMMER What would have happened if I went to the movies instead? If I went somewhere else for lunch? If I showed up to eat ten minutes later? Tom, it was meant to be, just like you said. And as it was happening, I knew it. I could feel it, sure as the sun. And I kept thinking to myself \"Holy shit. Tom was right.\" You were right about all of it. (BEAT) It just wasn't me you were right about. \nTom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a few seconds more. And then, the hands separate. \nSUMMER Anyway, I should probably be getting back. It was good to see you. I'm glad you're well. \nSummer gets up and starts walking away from him. After a SECOND: \nTOM Summer! \nShe stops and turns back. He takes in her face, most likely for the last time ever. \nTOM I really do hope you're happy. \nSUMMER I know. (BEAT) See you later. \nAnd she walks away. The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her, leaving Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every second. \nFADE OUT: \nA FEW SECONDS OF BLACK, BEFORE... \nFADE IN: \nINT OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY \nTom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big time. \nTom waits. \nWe notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back. \nGIRL Are you here to interview? \nTOM Sorry? \nGIRL Are you interviewing? For the position? \nTOM Oh. Yeah. Why, are you? \nGIRL Yup. \nTOM Ah. My competition. \nGIRL It would appear. \nTOM Gee, this is a little awkward. \nGIRL Yes it is. \nTOM Well, I hope you don't get it. \nGIRL I hope you don't get it. They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her. And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it. \nTOM So, uh... \nGIRL Hmm? \nTOM Are you from...California? \n", "test1_input": "RACHEL I know what you mean. That's what happened with me and Sean. \nTOM Who the hell's Sean? \nRACHEL My boyfriend before Mark. \nTOM Who the f--! Never mind. Help me. I need solid female advice. \nRACHEL I'm 12. \nTOM Yeah but, you know me. This is the kinda stuff that always gets me in trouble. \nRACHEL Hmm. So, basically you do want to ask the question, `are we boyfriend/girlfriend?' You're just afraid you'll get an answer you don't want and that will shatter your illusions of how good everything's been these past few months. Is that about right? \nTOM (BEAT) Something like that. \nRACHEL Thomas, tell me this. Is it worse to get the wrong answer now... or find out in a month she has a date coming up with Lars from Norway? \nTOM Who's Lars? \nRACHEL He's a professional surfer with Brad Pitt's face and Jesus's abs. \nTOM That son of a bitch. \nRACHEL You see what I mean? \nThe whistle blows again and Rachel gets up to go back on the field. \nRACHEL Later dude. \nTOM Coach, no, wait! I need her. (shouting to Rachel) Rachel, what do you think I should do? \nRACHEL (calling back) Just don't be a pussy. \nOn Tom, we: \nCUT TO: \nINT TOM'S CAR - THAT NIGHT \nTom and Summer driving on the Golden Gate. Tom is very conflicted and we can see it in his face. They're silent a few beats, before: \nSUMMER Hi. \nTOM Hi. \nSUMMER Are you ok? \nTOM Yeah. \nSUMMER You sure? \nHe's not. He clenches his teeth. And begins... \nTOM Summer, I've gotta ask you something. \nSUMMER Ok. \nHe takes a deep breath. He's about to go on when: \nSUMMER Wait! \nSummer finds on the radio a particular song. (\"Waiting in Vain\" by Bob Marley, if you must know.) \nSUMMER Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk during this song. It's too beautiful. \nAnd it is. Tom's hand is on the gear shift. She puts hers there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches Summer listening. There's something about this moment, the way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this girl. \nMarley sings: \nB.M. \"In life I know there's lots of grief/ but your love is my relief.\" \nWe know, as well as he does: he will ask nothing tonight. \nINT PARTY - NIGHT \nTom and Summer are in a LARGE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE at a party. TIME CUTS reveal that Summer is talking with, laughing with, drinking with, and possibly flirting with many of them. Tom notices, smiles, pretends it doesn't mean anything, but he's clearly jealous, not in a sexual way but of the attention they're getting from her. It's been a while. He misses that attention. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BOOKSTORE - DAY \nTom, starting to get that unshaven, unkempt look, wanders through the self-help section. He leafs through some of the titles. He grabs just about every one of them. \n", "test1_true": "Tom has more than fifty self-help books on a shelf by his bed. He reads from one called \"Six Steps to Getting Over Him.\" \nTOM (V.O.) \"So he broke your heart. You've been sad and depressed for weeks. Perhaps you've turned to drinking or even drugs. And nothing's helped. Now what? Should you binge on rocky road and watch soaps all day?\" \nSECONDS LATER. Tom sits in his bed eating ice cream. He continues to read. \nTOM (V.O.) \"No you should not.\" \nHe slowly puts the ice cream down. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Through extensive research, we have found the six most effective ways to get over that lost love and make room in your heart for a new man to fill. Those steps are:\" \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nTom jogs. \nTOM (V.O.) \"One. Exercise. The body's release of endorphins will assuage the brain and provide a genuine sense of accomplishment and success.\" \nCars pass him at top speed. Bicycles breeze by him. A child on a big wheel soars past. He may as well be jogging in place. \nINT. YOGA CENTER - NIGHT \nTom is taking a yoga class. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Two. Physical and Mental relaxation. Channel all of your energies to the core of your being for a new understanding of the self and others.\" \nThis shit is really fucking hard when you're as inflexible as Tom. Everyone else in the class seems at peace. Tom can't even get the breathing right. \nINT. HOMELESS SHELTER - DAY \nTom feels good about himself as he gives out food to the homeless. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Three. Charity. Reach out! You are not alone in your pain.\" \nNext in line is a HOMELESS COUPLE holding hands. Tom spirits immediately fall. Even these two somehow found each other. \nINT SHOE STORE - DAY \nTom stands in the center of a fashionable ladies shoe store. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Four. Shoe Shopping! Ladies...you know you want to. Indulge!\" \nANGLE ON TOM, just sorta standing there. Confused. He doesn't really want new shoes. \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nTom backpacks alone in the forest. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Five. Travel. Take some time to see another environment. Get perspective. It's a beautiful world. It will be for you again someday.\" \nThis is it, he's finally found some peace. Tom looks up to the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and takes a deep breath. \nFREEZE ON TOM. \nINFORMATION BUBBLES pop up on the screen to point out that Tom is standing in POISON OAK. There's a RUSTY BEAR TRAP a step ahead of him. A giant POISONOUS SNAKE creeping up behind him. A TICK on his leg. And in the distance a HUNTER has Tom sized up in his rifle sight. \nUNFREEZE. \nTom starts to itch... \nINT. APARTMENT - LATER \nTom is painting the walls of his now nearly bare apartment. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Six. Redecorate. Start anew.\" \nHe's focused on his task and in fact seems pretty good at it. \nTOM (V.O.) \"By taking these few steps, you will have discovered your inner strength and should be ready to move on. I bet you can hardly remember his face at all.\" \nWe pull back to REVEAL Tom has painted a giant mural of Summer on his wall. He looks at the self-help book and dropkicks it. \nINT CROWDED BAR - NIGHT \nSummer and Tom stand by the bar. \nTOM I just don't get women's fashion nowadays. Everybody with the tattoos, the giant hoop earrings, those annoying hats. Explain this to me. \nSUMMER People think it looks good. \nTOM Do you? \n", "test1_id": 2550, "test2_input": "Tom is wandering through the office whistling. \nMCKENZIE Hansen, don't you have like twenty bar mitzvah cards to write? \nTOM Nope. All done. What are you working on? \nMCKENZIE Congratulations. But I've run out of ways to say it. \"Good job,\" \"well done,\" \"way to go\"... I got nothing. \nTOM Why don't you try... \"Everyday you make me proud. But today, you get a card.\" \nMCKENZIE (BEAT) Shit. That's not bad. \nTOM No worries. \nTom walks by the room marked \"Weddings and Anniversaries.\" He's about to keep going when he pauses. \nINT WEDDINGS AND ANNIVERSARIES SUITE - LATER \nAll of the people who work in here are MIDDLE AGED WOMEN. Currently, they are standing around one desk where Tom sits writing everyone's cards. \nTOM This is good Millie. \"To my wife, the love of my life. I love you.\" That's very nice. I was thinking though, why not try something like... \"Everyday that we don't meet is meaningless and incomplete.\" You know, spice it up a little. \nThe Women clutch their heart like they might faint. \nINT RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS WING - LATER \nWorkers are again all gathered around Tom. \nTOM Did you try... \"Merry?\" \nALL Whoa/Perfect/Yes! \nTOM What else you got? \nEMPLOYEE #1 Passover. \nTom says something totally in Yiddish. No one knows what the hell he just said except for one Employee who bursts out in tears of joy. \nINT OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER \nTom passes Summer at her desk. She waves. He waves back. He's so in love with her. \nINT ANOTHER WING - LATER \nANGLE ON TOM writing furiously at a computer terminal. \nTOM \"...aint no woman got what you got, sista girl. Happy birthday to the lean, sheen, and sizzly mocha queen!\" (BEAT) How's that? \nThe AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAHOGANY WRITERS are impressed. \nMAHOGANY WRITER #1 Something's gotten into you son! \nTOM Yeah. It's pretty cool. \nEXT MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT \nTom and Summer in line to buy tickets. \nTOM You really want to see this? \nSUMMER It sounds amazing. \nTOM It's, like, all stabbing and shit. \nSUMMER Exactly. \nTOM Ok. \nSUMMER All you take me to are sappy little romances. I want to see some open wounds, damn it. I want carnage. \nTOM Fantastic. \nSuddenly, Tom sees something at the front of the line. \nTOM Oh shit. \nSUMMER What? \nAnd here they come, Tom's mom and step-dad, Sarah and Martin. Tom's face registers a noticeable panic. \nSARAH Hey! \nSarah and Martin are delighted at this coincidence. Sarah hugs and kisses her son. \n", "test2_true": "Summer smiles. Maybe this will be ok. \nTOM Mom, Martin, this is Summer. \nSARAH Summer! Well hello! We've heard so much about you! It's so good to finally meet you. \nSarah hugs Summer. \nSUMMER You too. \nAnd now Martin weighs in with his own hug. Tom notices Summer's face growing increasingly concerned. Why is he hugging me? \nMARTIN (to Tom) Is this the girlfriend? \nTom is caught like a deer in headlights. What can he do? \nTOM Well this is the girl friend I've told you about. I don't know if \"girlfriend\" is the right word... \nSARAH You going to see the serial killer one? \nSUMMER Yes we are. \nSARAH Great! Should we save you seats? \nAgain, this has become incredibly awkward for Tom and for Summer. \nSUMMER Absolutely. \nSARAH Ok. We'll see you inside. \nWhen they're out of earshot, Tom sees that Summer is distraught. \nTOM Sorry about that. \nSUMMER It's fine. \nTOM You wanna go do something else? We can totally bolt. \nSUMMER Did you tell them I was your girlfriend? \nTOM What?! No way... I never used that word. \nSUMMER They seemed to think... I mean, why is your step-dad giving me a hug? \nTOM He's very...loving. \nSUMMER Does he hug all your friends? \nThere's that word again. \nSummer looks at Tom, like she's disappointed or even angry at him for something. Then she walks ahead of him into the theatre. He's forced to follow. Answer-less, as conflicted as ever. Why is none of this easy? \nCUT TO: \nINT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER \nSummer, Tom, Sarah, Martin in a row. Summer's face is cold, emotionless. Tom tries to look at her, to make eye contact, something. She knows he's looking but it doesn't make her head turn his way. Tom gives up and watches the movie. \nANGLE ON THE MOVIE SCREEN. We see a BLACK AND WHITE FILM. \nIt's a MAN racing down the street, fleeing from an unseen assassin. When he turns around we see the man is TOM. Bullets fly and he's hit repeatedly in the back while running away like Belmondo in BREATHLESS. He dies an elaborate, violent, horrible on-screen death. \nINT CLUB - NIGHT \nRave music blares. Tom stands off to the side looking miserable. Summer is on the dance floor. Though she's not really dancing with anyone in particular, she's dancing with everyone. Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another. \nSUMMER You're not having any fun. \nTOM You're having enough for both of us. \nSUMMER I'm dancing. I haven't danced in ages. God. Come on. \nTOM No. \nSUMMER Come on! I wanna dance with you. \nTOM Where were you an hour ago? I might have danced then. I've been standing here by myself this whole time and you didn't look over once. \nSUMMER So you're pissed? \nTOM I'm not pissed.

She wouldn't do that. \nHis friends say nothing. \nTOM (BEAT) Fuck! \nAnd with that he storms off. \nMCKENZIE Tom! \nPAUL Let him go. \nANGLE ON Tom walking away from them. \nLiterally, his entire universe falls apart. \nFX: BUILDINGS come crumbling down. The whole city turns to rubble. He's the only constant as the world around him is ERASED, brick by brick, beam by beam, as if by an unseen force and reduced to nothing. \nCUT TO: \nBLACK. \nAnd we fade up those famous OPENING BARS OF \"HAVA NAGILA.\" \nCU on a CIRCLE OF PEOPLE HOLDING HANDS, some young, some old, Tom right in the mix trying hard to smile. Has he joined a cult? \nWe are: \nINT BALLROOM - NIGHT \nTom's sister Rachel's Bat Mitzvah. Tom and his family have formed a traditional Hora. They dance in a big circle and clap their hands. A chair is brought to the center and Rachel is lifted high above the circle by Tom, his step-dad, and some others. \nCUT TO: \nLATER. Rachel is standing by a cake with a microphone. \nRACHEL Your apple pies are really great. So Uncle Sid and Aunt Ro, come light candle number eight! \nANGLE ON TOM sitting with his mom Sarah at the table. They clap. Mom looks at her son knowing something is wrong. Tom catches her looking. \nCUT TO: \nLATER. Tom being accosted by two more Aunts. \nAUNT ANITA I can't believe that. No girlfriend? \nTOM I can't believe it either! \nAUNT BETSY What are you 30? You should be married now. With a family. What are you waiting for? \nTOM The right girl I guess. \nAUNT BETSY There's girls everywhere. I bet you have to beat em off with a stick. \nTOM Oh you'd be surprised. \nAUNT ANITA (actually squeezing his CHEEKS) Look at this punum. Are all those girls blind? \nAUNT BETSY My friend Mimi has a granddaughter. Yay high. Great figure. Bosom out to here -- \nTOM Hey I appreciate that Aunt Betsy. Lord knows I like bosoms. It's just... I recently got out of a...well, I don't know what it was. \nAUNT ANITA Oh I'm sorry. When was that? \nTOM July. \nAUNT BETSY You mean...seven months ago? \nAUNT ANITA Was it a man? \nTOM What? \nAUNT BETSY She's means `are you a homosexual?' \nTOM No. Where's that coming from? \nAUNT BETSY We just always wondered. \nAwkward. \n", "test3_true": "CUT TO: \nLATER. Tom at the bar. He downs his drink in one gulp. \nCUT TO: \nLATER. ANGLE ON Tom alone at the table. The band plays \"Lady in Red\" and everyone's dancing. When we're back on Tom, he's sitting with Summer. \nTOM Well...glad you came? \nSUMMER Of course. Where am I exactly? \nTOM When you turn 13 in the Jewish religion, you officially become an adult. \nANGLE ON RACHEL, dancing with a BOY. \nSUMMER Wow. So this is a big day in your sister's life. \nTOM Pretty big, yeah. \nSUMMER (BEAT) So why aren't you smiling? \nANGLE ON TOM. Alone. Still not smiling. Rachel arrives in the nick of time. \nRACHEL Hey brother. Wanna dance? \nShe drags him to the dance floor. \nRACHEL Hi. \nTOM You having fun? You were great this morning. \nRACHEL Yeah yeah yeah. Talk to me. How are you? \nTOM Me? I'm good. I'm great. \nRACHEL (re: Summer's engagement) I heard. \nTOM Yeah. \nRACHEL Sucks. \nTOM Yup. \nIt's silent a few beats. \nTOM Anyway, who cares about me? This is your day. \nShe hugs him. Tight. He doesn't cry but he could. \nRACHEL You know, my friends... they're all in love with you. \nTOM Is that right? \nRACHEL Look. \nHe sees a coven of 13-year olds swooning across the dance floor at him. \nTOM That's nice. \nRACHEL What I tell ya? There are plenty other fish in the sea. \nTOM Those are guppies. \nRACHEL Who knows, someday one might turn out to be your \"true love.\" \nTOM Are you making fun of me now? \nRACHEL No I'm serious. \nTOM I got news for you Rach. That true love stuff... it's make-believe. \nRACHEL Well that's not very romantic. \nTOM It's the new me. \nThe song ends. \nTOM Alright... go play with your friends. \nRACHEL You'll be ok? \n", "test3_id": 2552}

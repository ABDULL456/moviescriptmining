{"test1_input": "RACHEL I know what you mean. That's what happened with me and Sean. \nTOM Who the hell's Sean? \nRACHEL My boyfriend before Mark. \nTOM Who the f--! Never mind. Help me. I need solid female advice. \nRACHEL I'm 12. \nTOM Yeah but, you know me. This is the kinda stuff that always gets me in trouble. \nRACHEL Hmm. So, basically you do want to ask the question, `are we boyfriend/girlfriend?' You're just afraid you'll get an answer you don't want and that will shatter your illusions of how good everything's been these past few months. Is that about right? \nTOM (BEAT) Something like that. \nRACHEL Thomas, tell me this. Is it worse to get the wrong answer now... or find out in a month she has a date coming up with Lars from Norway? \nTOM Who's Lars? \nRACHEL He's a professional surfer with Brad Pitt's face and Jesus's abs. \nTOM That son of a bitch. \nRACHEL You see what I mean? \nThe whistle blows again and Rachel gets up to go back on the field. \nRACHEL Later dude. \nTOM Coach, no, wait! I need her. (shouting to Rachel) Rachel, what do you think I should do? \nRACHEL (calling back) Just don't be a pussy. \nOn Tom, we: \nCUT TO: \nINT TOM'S CAR - THAT NIGHT \nTom and Summer driving on the Golden Gate. Tom is very conflicted and we can see it in his face. They're silent a few beats, before: \nSUMMER Hi. \nTOM Hi. \nSUMMER Are you ok? \nTOM Yeah. \nSUMMER You sure? \nHe's not. He clenches his teeth. And begins... \nTOM Summer, I've gotta ask you something. \nSUMMER Ok. \nHe takes a deep breath. He's about to go on when: \nSUMMER Wait! \nSummer finds on the radio a particular song. (\"Waiting in Vain\" by Bob Marley, if you must know.) \nSUMMER Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk during this song. It's too beautiful. \nAnd it is. Tom's hand is on the gear shift. She puts hers there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches Summer listening. There's something about this moment, the way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this girl. \nMarley sings: \nB.M. \"In life I know there's lots of grief/ but your love is my relief.\" \nWe know, as well as he does: he will ask nothing tonight. \nINT PARTY - NIGHT \nTom and Summer are in a LARGE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE at a party. TIME CUTS reveal that Summer is talking with, laughing with, drinking with, and possibly flirting with many of them. Tom notices, smiles, pretends it doesn't mean anything, but he's clearly jealous, not in a sexual way but of the attention they're getting from her. It's been a while. He misses that attention. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BOOKSTORE - DAY \nTom, starting to get that unshaven, unkempt look, wanders through the self-help section. He leafs through some of the titles. He grabs just about every one of them. \n", "test1_true": "Tom has more than fifty self-help books on a shelf by his bed. He reads from one called \"Six Steps to Getting Over Him.\" \nTOM (V.O.) \"So he broke your heart. You've been sad and depressed for weeks. Perhaps you've turned to drinking or even drugs. And nothing's helped. Now what? Should you binge on rocky road and watch soaps all day?\" \nSECONDS LATER. Tom sits in his bed eating ice cream. He continues to read. \nTOM (V.O.) \"No you should not.\" \nHe slowly puts the ice cream down. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Through extensive research, we have found the six most effective ways to get over that lost love and make room in your heart for a new man to fill. Those steps are:\" \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nTom jogs. \nTOM (V.O.) \"One. Exercise. The body's release of endorphins will assuage the brain and provide a genuine sense of accomplishment and success.\" \nCars pass him at top speed. Bicycles breeze by him. A child on a big wheel soars past. He may as well be jogging in place. \nINT. YOGA CENTER - NIGHT \nTom is taking a yoga class. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Two. Physical and Mental relaxation. Channel all of your energies to the core of your being for a new understanding of the self and others.\" \nThis shit is really fucking hard when you're as inflexible as Tom. Everyone else in the class seems at peace. Tom can't even get the breathing right. \nINT. HOMELESS SHELTER - DAY \nTom feels good about himself as he gives out food to the homeless. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Three. Charity. Reach out! You are not alone in your pain.\" \nNext in line is a HOMELESS COUPLE holding hands. Tom spirits immediately fall. Even these two somehow found each other. \nINT SHOE STORE - DAY \nTom stands in the center of a fashionable ladies shoe store. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Four. Shoe Shopping! Ladies...you know you want to. Indulge!\" \nANGLE ON TOM, just sorta standing there. Confused. He doesn't really want new shoes. \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nTom backpacks alone in the forest. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Five. Travel. Take some time to see another environment. Get perspective. It's a beautiful world. It will be for you again someday.\" \nThis is it, he's finally found some peace. Tom looks up to the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and takes a deep breath. \nFREEZE ON TOM. \nINFORMATION BUBBLES pop up on the screen to point out that Tom is standing in POISON OAK. There's a RUSTY BEAR TRAP a step ahead of him. A giant POISONOUS SNAKE creeping up behind him. A TICK on his leg. And in the distance a HUNTER has Tom sized up in his rifle sight. \nUNFREEZE. \nTom starts to itch... \nINT. APARTMENT - LATER \nTom is painting the walls of his now nearly bare apartment. \nTOM (V.O.) \"Six. Redecorate. Start anew.\" \nHe's focused on his task and in fact seems pretty good at it. \nTOM (V.O.) \"By taking these few steps, you will have discovered your inner strength and should be ready to move on. I bet you can hardly remember his face at all.\" \nWe pull back to REVEAL Tom has painted a giant mural of Summer on his wall. He looks at the self-help book and dropkicks it. \nINT CROWDED BAR - NIGHT \nSummer and Tom stand by the bar. \nTOM I just don't get women's fashion nowadays. Everybody with the tattoos, the giant hoop earrings, those annoying hats. Explain this to me. \nSUMMER People think it looks good. \nTOM Do you? \n", "test1_id": 2550, "test2_input": "TOM It's impossible. It doesn't make sense. Where did they meet? Is it someone we know? \nPAUL No. \nTOM So everything she said. All that stuff about... it can't be. Not her. I know her too well. She wouldn't do that. \nHis friends say nothing. \nTOM (BEAT) Fuck! \nAnd with that he storms off. \nMCKENZIE Tom! \nPAUL Let him go. \nANGLE ON Tom walking away from them. \nLiterally, his entire universe falls apart. \nFX: BUILDINGS come crumbling down. The whole city turns to rubble. He's the only constant as the world around him is ERASED, brick by brick, beam by beam, as if by an unseen force and reduced to nothing. \nCUT TO: \nBLACK. \nAnd we fade up those famous OPENING BARS OF \"HAVA NAGILA.\" \nCU on a CIRCLE OF PEOPLE HOLDING HANDS, some young, some old, Tom right in the mix trying hard to smile. Has he joined a cult? \nWe are: \nINT BALLROOM - NIGHT \nTom's sister Rachel's Bat Mitzvah. Tom and his family have formed a traditional Hora. They dance in a big circle and clap their hands. A chair is brought to the center and Rachel is lifted high above the circle by Tom, his step-dad, and some others. \nCUT TO: \nLATER. Rachel is standing by a cake with a microphone. \nRACHEL Your apple pies are really great. So Uncle Sid and Aunt Ro, come light candle number eight! \nANGLE ON TOM sitting with his mom Sarah at the table. They clap. Mom looks at her son knowing something is wrong. Tom catches her looking. \nCUT TO: \nLATER. Tom being accosted by two more Aunts. \nAUNT ANITA I can't believe that. No girlfriend? \nTOM I can't believe it either! \nAUNT BETSY What are you 30? You should be married now. With a family. What are you waiting for? \nTOM The right girl I guess. \nAUNT BETSY There's girls everywhere. I bet you have to beat em off with a stick. \nTOM Oh you'd be surprised. \nAUNT ANITA (actually squeezing his CHEEKS) Look at this punum. Are all those girls blind? \nAUNT BETSY My friend Mimi has a granddaughter. Yay high. Great figure. Bosom out to here -- \nTOM Hey I appreciate that Aunt Betsy. Lord knows I like bosoms. It's just... I recently got out of a...well, I don't know what it was. \nAUNT ANITA Oh I'm sorry. When was that? \nTOM July. \nAUNT BETSY You mean...seven months ago? \nAUNT ANITA Was it a man? \nTOM What? \nAUNT BETSY She's means `are you a homosexual?' \nTOM No. Where's that coming from? \nAUNT BETSY We just always wondered. \nAwkward. \n", "test2_true": "CUT TO: \nLATER. Tom at the bar. He downs his drink in one gulp. \nCUT TO: \nLATER. ANGLE ON Tom alone at the table. The band plays \"Lady in Red\" and everyone's dancing. When we're back on Tom, he's sitting with Summer. \nTOM Well...glad you came? \nSUMMER Of course. Where am I exactly? \nTOM When you turn 13 in the Jewish religion, you officially become an adult. \nANGLE ON RACHEL, dancing with a BOY. \nSUMMER Wow. So this is a big day in your sister's life. \nTOM Pretty big, yeah. \nSUMMER (BEAT) So why aren't you smiling? \nANGLE ON TOM. Alone. Still not smiling. Rachel arrives in the nick of time. \nRACHEL Hey brother. Wanna dance? \nShe drags him to the dance floor. \nRACHEL Hi. \nTOM You having fun? You were great this morning. \nRACHEL Yeah yeah yeah. Talk to me. How are you? \nTOM Me? I'm good. I'm great. \nRACHEL (re: Summer's engagement) I heard. \nTOM Yeah. \nRACHEL Sucks. \nTOM Yup. \nIt's silent a few beats. \nTOM Anyway, who cares about me? This is your day. \nShe hugs him. Tight. He doesn't cry but he could. \nRACHEL You know, my friends... they're all in love with you. \nTOM Is that right? \nRACHEL Look. \nHe sees a coven of 13-year olds swooning across the dance floor at him. \nTOM That's nice. \nRACHEL What I tell ya? There are plenty other fish in the sea. \nTOM Those are guppies. \nRACHEL Who knows, someday one might turn out to be your \"true love.\" \nTOM Are you making fun of me now? \nRACHEL No I'm serious. \nTOM I got news for you Rach. That true love stuff... it's make-believe. \nRACHEL Well that's not very romantic. \nTOM It's the new me. \nThe song ends. \nTOM Alright... go play with your friends. \nRACHEL You'll be ok? \n", "test2_id": 2551, "test3_input": "Summer takes a beat to let this hang there. \nSUMMER I was right? \nAnd then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh. \nTOM What? This is funny? \nTries to stop but it only makes it worse. Now's she's completely cracking up. \nTOM What are you laughing at? \nAnd she can't stop. She's totally lost control. \nTOM (trying himself not to LAUGH) You're a crazy person! \nSUMMER Tom! You're the crazy person! \nTOM What are you talking about?! \nSUMMER One day I'm reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it. Now he's my husband! \nTOM This is funny to you? \nSUMMER What would have happened if I went to the movies instead? If I went somewhere else for lunch? If I showed up to eat ten minutes later? Tom, it was meant to be, just like you said. And as it was happening, I knew it. I could feel it, sure as the sun. And I kept thinking to myself \"Holy shit. Tom was right.\" You were right about all of it. (BEAT) It just wasn't me you were right about. \nTom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a few seconds more. And then, the hands separate. \nSUMMER Anyway, I should probably be getting back. It was good to see you. I'm glad you're well. \nSummer gets up and starts walking away from him. After a SECOND: \nTOM Summer! \nShe stops and turns back. He takes in her face, most likely for the last time ever. \nTOM I really do hope you're happy. \nSUMMER I know. (BEAT) See you later. \nAnd she walks away. The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her, leaving Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every second. \nFADE OUT: \nA FEW SECONDS OF BLACK, BEFORE... \nFADE IN: \nINT OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY \nTom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big time. \nTom waits. \nWe notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back. \nGIRL Are you here to interview? \nTOM Sorry? \nGIRL Are you interviewing? For the position? \nTOM Oh. Yeah. Why, are you? \nGIRL Yup. \nTOM Ah. My competition. \nGIRL It would appear. \nTOM Gee, this is a little awkward. \nGIRL Yes it is. \nTOM Well, I hope you don't get it. \nGIRL I hope you don't get it. They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her. And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it. \nTOM So, uh... \nGIRL Hmm? \nTOM Are you from...California? \n", "test3_true": "TOM I know Atherton. Nice area. \nGIRL Have I seen you before? \nTOM I, uh, don't know. I don't think so. \nGIRL Do you go to St. Patrick's? Not to pray or anything but to stand outside? \nTOM I do! I love that church. It's like my favorite structure in the city. \nGIRL If only it wasn't near that horrible mirrored thing... \nTOM Yes! Exactly. I totally agree! \nGIRL Yeah. (BEAT) I think I've seen you there. \nTOM You have? Really? Hmm. I didn't see you. \nGIRL It happens. You probably weren't looking. \nA MAN comes out. \nMAN Tom Hansen? \nTOM Yes. \nMAN Come on back. \nTOM Thank you. \nHe starts to go. But halfway through the doorway, he pauses and looks back at the girl. \nNARRATOR If Tom had learned anything... it was that you can't ascribe great cosmic significance to a simple earthly event. Coincidence. That's all anything ever is. Nothing more than coincidence. \nANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast. Hardly noticeable. But it's there. \nNARRATOR It took a long time but Tom had finally learned. There are no miracles. There's no such thing as fate. Nothing is meant to be. He knew. He was sure of it now. (BEAT) Tom was... \nTom turns back around. \nNARRATOR ...pretty sure. \nTOM (to Girl) Excuse me. \nGIRL Hello stranger. \nTOM When this is over... uh... would you like to maybe...grab a cup of coffee or something? \nGIRL Oh. I'm sorta supposed to meet someone. \nTOM (DEFLATED) Oh. Got it... No problem. \nHe turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on the task at hand. A job interview. And then he hears. \nGIRL Ok. \nTom turns back around. \nTOM What's that? \nGIRL Why not? \nTOM Yeah? \nGIRL Yeah. \nTOM Great! So... I'll wait for you here, or you wait for me or...something. \nShe laughs. She's cute when she laughs. \nGIRL We'll figure it out. \nTOM Ok! (extends hand to shake) My name's Tom. \nGIRL Nice to meet you... \nShe puts out her hand to meet his. They shake. \nGIRL I'm Autumn. \nAnd on his face... \n", "test3_id": 2552}

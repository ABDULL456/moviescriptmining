{"train": "\"JACOB'S LADDER\" \nby \nBruce Joel Rubin \nEXT.  VIETNAM - DUSK \nA swarm of helicopters swoops out of a yellow sky and deposits an army of men over a Vietnamese hillside. \nThe SOLDIERS scramble over the terraced rice paddies for the protection of the jungle. Falling into coulmns, like strands of soldier ants, seventy-five men, at combat readiness, assemble on the edge of a sweltering wilderness. \nIt is dusk. The mood is lazy, soporific. Members of one platoon huddle close to the ground smoking a joint. JERRY Strong stuff. \nROD (to JACOB, a soldier squatting several yards away) Hey, Professor, how many times can you shit in an hour? \nGEORGE Don't bug 'im. \nDOUG Where are those gooks already? \nFRANK Some offensive. I don't even think they're out there. \nPAUL Jesus, this grass is something else. \nJACOB SINGER returns to the group, pulling up his pants. \nROD Why even bother to pull 'em up? \nFRANK You jackin' off out there again, huh Jake? \nPAUL Hey, get off his back. \nROD It's called philosophizing, right Professor? \nJACOB gives them the finger. \nJACOB Up yours, you adolescent scum. \nLaughter. \nSERGEANT (V.O.) Mount your bayonets. \nFRANK (frightened) Oh shit! \nPAUL Goddam! \nROD Gimme that joint! \nJERRY Hey, something's wrong. \nGEORGE What is it? \nJERRY My head. \nGEORGE It's nerves. Take another toke. \nGEORGE reaches out, extending a joint. Suddenly he gasps and falls to the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably. The others stand back, startled. JACOB grabs him and shoves a rifle barrel between his chattering teeth. \nROD What's going on? \nBefore anyone can answer JERRY grabs his head, screaming. He turns frantically in all directions. \nJERRY Help me! Help me! \nPAUL What the hell ... ? \nIn seconds JERRY is spinning wildly out of control, his head shaking into a terrific blur. He crashes into FRANK with the force of a truck. FRANK slams into the ground as all the air rushes from his lungs. He begins gasping and hyperventilating. His eyes grow wide and frenzied as he gulps for air. Fear and confusion sweep across his face. The MEN watch, horrified, as FRANK's terror escalates beyond reason into all- out panic. \nSuddenly FRANK begins howling. He lunges for his bayonet and, without warning, attacks the MEN around him. \nPAUL God Almighty! \nPAUL spins out of the way as FRANK's bayonet impales the ground. JACOB jumps on top of FRANK and wrestles him into the tall grass. PAUL rushes to his assistance. \nJACOB stares at FRANK's face as FRANK struggles beneath him. It is the face of a madman. \nPAUL Good God! What's happening? \nThe sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting erupting behind them. Guns crackle and bursts of light penetrate the darkening sky. \nROD Behind you! Look out! This is it! \nThe MEN spin around. PAUL panics and jumps to his feet, leaving JACOB alone with FRANK. FRANK's eyes burn with demonic force as he gathers his strength. \nJACOB Don't leave me. \nDark figures, silhouetted by the setting sun, are storming at them. SOLDIERS squint to see. It is a horrifying vision. \nPAUL They're coming! \nJACOB steps off a graffiti-festooned ELEVATOR into a long impersonal hallway. He uses three keys to unlock the door to his APARTMENT. \nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAWN \nJACOB enters the darkness without turning on the light. He tries to navigate his way to the BATHROOM, illuminated by a tiny nightlight in the distance. His effort is unsuccessful. He bangs loudly into a table. A WOMAN\"s voice calls out. \nJEZZIE (V.O.) Jake, is that you? \nJACOB What the hell did you do, move all the furniture? \nJEZZIE (V.O.) Why didn't you turn on the light? \nJACOB I didn't want to wake you. \nJEZZIE (V.O.) (sleepy but pleasant) Gee, thanks a lot. \nJACOB Where is the lamp? \nJEZZIE (V.O.) Where are you? \nJACOB If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was. \nJEZZIE (V.O.) I moved the couch. That's all. \nJACOB Where to? \nJACOB crashes into it. A light suddenly goes on. JEZEBEL \"JEZZIE\" PIPKIN, 33, is standing in the BEDROOM door tying a man's terrycloth bathrobe around her waist. Although sleepy, disheveled, and not looking her best, it is obvious that JEZZIE is a beefy woman, juicy and sensual. \nJEZZIE That help? \nJACOB (nearly sprawled over the couch) Thanks. \nHe pushes himself up. \nJEZZIE What do you think? \nJACOB What do you mean? \nJEZZIE The room! \nJACOB Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow. \nJEZZIE It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late? \nJACOB Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time. \nJEZZIE (seeing the grease on his uniform) What happened to you? \nJACOB (unbuttoning his shirt as he walks to the BATHROOM) Don't ask. \nJACOB steps into the BATHROOM and pulls at his clothes, leaving them in a pile on the floor. He reaches for the faucet and sends a stream of water pouding against the porcelain tub. JEZZIE enjoys JACOB's nakedness. She reaches out to his chest and squeezes one of his nipples. His body tenses slightly. JEZZIE drops her robe. They enter the shower together. \nEXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT \nA DENSE RAIN falls on a dark night filling puddles of water. JACOB is crawling through the underbrush in the Vietnamese JUNGLE. His shirt is bloodsoaked. He moves slowly, creeping on his right forearm. His left arm is holding his intestines from spilling onto the grass. \nJACOB Help me. Someone. \nSuddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance. It dances around the bamboo trees and draws closer to JACOB. It is impossible to see who is carrying it. The light darts near the ground where JACOB is lying and then bursts directly into his eyes. \nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAY \nSUNLIGHT pours through the BEDROOM window. JACOB is sleeping fitfully as a bar of light saturates his face. His hand rushes up to cover and protect his eyes but the damage is done. He is awake. \nJACOB lies in bed for a few moments, dazed. Slowly his hand gropes along the shelf at the head of the bed, searching for his glasses. He has trouble finding them. As his hand sweeps blindly across the headboard it hits the telephone and sends it crashing to the floor. He sits up with a disgusted look on his face and searches the out-of-focus shelf behind him. Suddenly JEZZIE enters. \nJEZZIE You up? \nJACOB No. Have you seen my glasses? \nJEZZIE (shaking her head) Where'd you leave 'em? \nJACOB I don't know. \nJEZZIE Did you look around the headboard? \nJACOB (wearily) Jezzie, I can't see. \nJEZZIE (she scans the shelf) Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom. \nShe leaves and returns moments later with his glasses and a large paper bag. She tosses them both onto the bed. \nJACOB Thanks. (he puts on his glasses and notices the bag) What's that? \nJEZZIE Your kid dropped it off. \nJACOB Who? Jed? \nJEZZIE (stooping to pick up the phone) No. The little one. \nJACOB Ready? \nJEZZIE Just gettin' rid of the garbage. \nJACOB and JEZZIE, both wearing postal uniforms, head for the ELEVATOR. They are surprised that it has arrived promptly. JEZZIE reaches out and playfully sticks her tongue into JACOB's ear. He pulls her into the ELEVATOR. They disappear, laughing, behind its closing doors. \nEXT.  NEW YORK CITY - DAY \nJACOB is driving a mail truck through the crowded streets of midtown Manhattan. As he drives he is humming to himself a rendition of Al Jolson's \"Sonny Boy.\" \nJACOB stops his truck in front of a LAUNDRY on West 46th Street. He opens the back door and pulls a stack of boxes toward him. He lifts them with effort and slams the door with his foot. It doesn't close. He considers giving it another whack but the boxes are heavy. He turns instead and waddles toward the store. \nINT.  LAUNDRY - DAY \nA heavyset WOMAN with a dark tan is standing behind a counter cluttered with laundry. A picture of Richard Nixon is still stapled to the wall. She looks at JACOB. \nWOMAN Where do you expect me to put those? I don't have any room. \nShe tries clearing the counter, but it doesn't help. \nWOMAN (continuing) How 'bout over there? (she points to a table) No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room. \nJACOB They're awfully heavy. \nWOMAN I know. That's why I'm asking. \nJACOB waddles reluctantly toward the back of the store. CHINESE LAUNDERERS are hovering over piles of clothes. Steam from the pressing machines shoots into the air. \nJACOB (huffing and puffing) Where's Wong? \nWOMAN That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired. \nJACOB stoops to put the boxes on the shelf. There is a snapping sound and he winces in pain. Massaging his back, JACOB unfolds some papers for the WOMAN's signature. \nJACOB How was Palm Springs? \nWOMAN Hot. Where do I sign? \nJACOB (pointing to the line) You got a nice tan, though. \nWOMAN Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask? (she looks heavenward) Two hundred dollars a night, for what? \nShe hands JACOB the wrong sheet. \nJACOB No. I'll take the other one. (he takes it) Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably. \nWOMAN If you're lucky. \nJACOB smiles to himself as he leaves the store. He walks carefully. His back is out. \nINT.  MAIL TRUCK - DAY \nANGLE ON THE MAIL TRUCK stuck in traffic. Nothing is moving. Horns are blaring and drivers are agitated. JACOB reaches for a newspaper lying on top of his mail bags. To his shock one of the bags appears to move. Curious, JACOB pokes at it. Instantly a terrifying figure pops out from beneath it and stares at him with a frightening glare. JACOB jumps back, stunned. It is a moment before he realizes that he is looking at an old WINO who has been sleeping in the truck. The man's face is covered in strange bumps. \nJACOB Goddamn it! What the hell ... ? \nWINO (pleading) I didn't take nothin'. I was just napping. Don't hit me. I was cold. \nJACOB (lifting the man up) What the hell do you think you're doing? You can't do this. This is government property. \nHe begins opening the door. The WINO begs. \nWINO Don't throw me out. They're gonna get me. They'll tear me to pieces. \nHe holds on to JACOB's leg. JACOB tries to pull away. \nJACOB Come on. You can't stay here. \nWINO Please! I never hurt anybody when I was alive. Believe me. I don't belong here. \nJACOB gives the WINO a strange look and then escorts him from the truck. A hundred eyes peer out of motionless cars and follow him as he leads the WINO to the sidewalk. JACOB pulls a dollar bill from his pocket and places it in the WINO's hand. The OLD MAN crumples it into a ball and turns away. He has a frightened look on his face. JACOB returns to the truck shaking his head. \nJACOB New York! \nHe climbs into his seat and glances into his rear view mirror. He notices the WINO edging fearfully along the side of a building. A horn honks and traffic begins moving. When JACOB looks back the WINO is no longer there. \nINT.  GARAGE - DAY \nJACOB drives his mail truck into the huge POST OFFICE PARKING GARAGE on 34th Street. His mind seems distracted. He has difficulty parking. \nINT.  POST OFFICE - DAY \nWe see a vast room filled with hundreds of PEOPLE sorting and moving mail. \nJACOB, carrying a bag of McDonald's hamburgers, walks stiffly through the aisles, his left hand rubbing his back. Several workers greet him and grab for his french fries. He offers them around. \nANGLE ON a conveyor belt sorting mail. A hand reaches in, correcting mistakes. Suddenly a hamburger passes by. JEZZIE looks up and smiles. \nJEZZIE Jake! \nJACOB I can't relax. \nLOUIS Wiggle your toes. \nJACOB wiggles his toes. At that instant, LOUIS twists JACOB's neck rapidly. There is a loud cracking sound. \nEXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT \nTHERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT. A MAN rushes at the camera yelling. \nMAN I found one. He's alive. \nHe shines a flashlight into the lens creating rings and halos. \nCHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY \nSuddenly LOUIS reappears, a halo effect still visible behind his head. \nJACOB God almighty. What did you do to me? \nLOUIS I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit. \nJACOB I had this weird flash just then. \nLOUIS What? \nJACOB I don't know. I've been having them recently. (he thinks a moment, then changes the subject) You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that? \nLOUIS Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you. \nJACOB Louis, you're a life saver. \nLOUIS I know. \nEXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING \nJACOB is walking down Nostrand Avenue. He is singing to himself and imitating Al Jolson. \nJACOB When there are gray skies, I don't mind the gray skies, as long as there's you ... \nHe hums. It is near dusk and lights are just coming on. The shop windows have a particularly garish look about them. The mannequins are dressed in inexpensive, almost tawdry, clothes and have a pathetic appearance. A few shops have set up their Christmas decorations. \nThe ornamentation seems strangely out of place; almost blasphemous. \nJACOB passes a street gang standing in the doorway of a local drug store. They chortle and make taunting sounds. \nGIRL (shaking her tits, singing) \"Hey, Mr. Postman ... \" \nJACOB stops and stares at them. To their surprise, he begins to sing with them. He knows the words. They like that. It is a sweet moment. \nJACOB continues walking. He comes to a cross street. The light is green. He is still singing to himself and does not notice a BLACK CAR sharging around the corner. The car is moving at full speed, heading straight toward him. A YOUNG MAN walking a few steps behind yells out. \nYOUNG MAN Look out! \nJACOB turns and sees the car. He scoots out of the way but it swerves in his direction. The YOUNG MAN calls out again. \nYOUNG MAN Jump! \nWith a huge thrust, JACOB hurls himself onto the curb as the car shoots by. Two MEN are peering at him from the back seat. They are laughing like madmen and shaking their heads. They do not look human. JACOB yells and waves his fist, to no effect. After a moment he turns to thank the YOUNG MAN whose scream had saved him, but he is gone. \nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - DUSK \nJACOB and JEZZIE are lying in bed. They are a sensual couple and even in quiet, reflective moments such as this, their positioning is erotic and stimulating. Both of them are nude. JACOB's hands are clasped behind his neck and he is staring mournfully at the ceiling. JEZZIE is lying on her side, her left leg draped across JACOB's pelvis. Her head is propped up on her right arm while her left hand strokes the bayonet scar on JACOB's stomach. Neither are talking. Suddenly, out of the blue, JEZZIE speaks. \nJEZZIE Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife. \nJACOB Why do you bring her up? \nJEZZIE 'Cause she's always on your mind. \nJACOB When was the last time I said a word? \nJEZZIE It has nothin' to do with talkin'. \nShe pauses for a while, long enough to suppose that the conversation is over. Then she continues. \nJEZZIE (continuing) Or maybe it's the war. \nJACOB closes his eyes. \nJEZZIE (continuing) It's still there, Jake. (she points to his brain) Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ... \nJACOB (annoyed) What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures? \nJEZZIE New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed. \nJACOB They're like demons, Jez. \nJEZZIE Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not. (she rubs his forehead) It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is. \nJACOB doesn't stop. A POLICEMAN, guarding the entrance, runs after him. \nJACOB charges through the interior corridors of the aging institution. A LINE OF MENTAL PATIENTS, all holding hands, is moving down the hall. They break ranks as he charges by and begin to scream. Their ATTENDANT tries to calm them down but the sight of the POLICEMAN increases their hysteria. They grab hold of him as he tries to get by. \nPOLICEMAN LET GO! GET AWAY! \nINT.  GROUP ROOM - DAY \nJACOB dashes out of view. He runs down another corridor, wildly searching for a specific room. He finds it and rushes inside. He is surprised to find A GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN seated in a circle. They all look up at him. \nLEADER Can I help you? \nJACOB I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office? \nThe LEADER stares at him uncomfortably. After a moment he gets up and takes JACOB into a corner of the room. Everyone is watching them. The LEADER speaks quietly. \nLEADER I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died. \nJACOB (stunned) Died? \nLEADER A car accident. \nJACOB Jesus, Jesus! ... When? \nLEADER Last month, before Thanksgiving. \nJACOB How did it happen? \nLEADER No one knows. They say it blew up. \nJACOB (growing pale) Blew up? What do you mean it blew up? \nThe LEADER shrugs and tries to put his arm around JACOB, but he pulls away. \nLEADER Do you want me to get someone? \nJACOB No. No. It's okay. I'm okay. \nHe backs quickly to the door. As he turns to leave he realizes that all of the PEOPLE in the group are watching him intently. \nUnsettled, JACOB hurries back into the hallway. He is frightened and confused. Suddenly a voice calls out. \nPOLICEMAN HEY YOU! MAILMAN! \nJACOB turns and sees the POLICEMAN waiting for him. His gun is drawn. \nPOLICEMAN Hold it. Just hold it. Where the hell do you think you are? This is Bellevue, for God's sake. People running around here get shot. \nThe GROUP LEADER pokes his head out of the door and motions to the POLICEMAN. \nLEADER It's alright. He's okay. \nPOLICEMAN (nodding, reholstering his gun) Come on, get out of here. I wouldn't want to interfere with the U.S. Mail. \nHe leads JACOB toward the lobby. JACOB does not look back. \nINT.  DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT \nWE HEAR LOUD DANCE MUSIC. SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE. JACOB is with some POST OFFICE EMPLOYEES at a crowded party in a small apartment. A DRUNK is telling a bad joke and trying to hold a glass of wine at the same time. It is constantly on the verge of spilling. JACOB is fixated on it. In the background, we see JEZZIE dancing and motioning for JACOB to join her. He nods no. The DRUNK, who keeps asking people if they \"get it,\" takes JACOB's head nodding as a sign of confusion and keeps trying to re-explain the joke. \nJACOB hears a strange noise and looks around. It seems to be coming from a covered bird cage. He goes over to it and lifts the cover. The BIRD is flapping its wings wildly as if trying to get out. The sound, loud and insistent, startles him. He lowers the cover. \nIn the DINING ROOM, several people are gathered around ELSA, an attractive black woman who is reading palms. She sees JACOB and calls over the music. \nELSA Hey, you! Let me look at your hand! \nJACOB shrugs. DELLA, dancing nearby, calls out. \nDELLA Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book. \nJACOB No, thanks. \nDELLA It's fun. \nCUT TO A CLOSE UP OF JACOB'S HAND. ELSA is squeezing the mounds and examining the lines. What begins as a playful expression on her face turns suddenly serious. She reaches for his other hand and compares the two of them. JEZZIE looks over from her dancing and eyes the scene jealously. \nELSA You have an unusual hand. \nJACOB I could have told you that. \nELSA You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split. \nShe studies his life line with growing concern. JEZZIE tries to get JACOB's attention. He ignores her. \nELSA (continuing) You know, you got a strange line here. \nJACOB (examining it) It's short, huh? \nELSA Short? It's ended. \nJACOB Where? \nJEZZIE What do you mean? Where do you think? \nJACOB Where's Della? Bring her here? \nJEZZIE Why? What for? \nJACOB Show me Della! \nJEZZIE (confused) Hey, I'm here. \nJACOB eyes her with a pleading look. Annoyed, JEZZIE leaves JACOB and crosses the room. He watches her as she goes. JACOB is holding his stomach and rocking painfully. Moments later JEZZIE returns with DELLA. \nDELLA Hiya Jake. That was some dance. \nJACOB (staring at her closely) Della? \nDELLA (feeling the strangeness) You want to see me? Well, here I am. \nJACOB I see. \nDELLA What do you want? \nJACOB Just to see you. That's all. \nDELLA (a bit uncomfortable) Well, how do I look? \nJACOB Like Della. \nSuddenly JACOB breaks out in a dense sweat and begins shaking. His entire body is convulsive. \nJEZZIE Are you feeling all right? Shit, you're burning up. Feel his forehead. \nDELLA (checking his forehead and cheeks) Damn, that's hot. Maybe from dancing. \nJEZZIE I think you should lie down. \nJACOB is shaking uncontrollably. People are gathering around. \nJEZZIE (continuing) Can't you stop it? \nJACOB If I could stop it, I'd stop it. \nWOMAN Is he sick? \nDELLA He's on fire. \nELSA Let me help you. \nShe reaches out to JACOB. Unexpectedly he recoils, jumping to his feet like a wild man. He begins to scream. \nJACOB Stay away from me! Don't you come near me! All of you. Go to hell! Go to hell, goddamn you! Stay away! \nJEZZIE stares at JACOB with a confused and embarrassed look. A MAN whispers to her. \nMAN I'll call a cab. \nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT \nJACOB is lying in bed in his own BEDROOM with a thermometer in his mouth. JEZZIE is pacing the floor with great agitation. \nJEZZIE I've never been so mortified in my whole life. Never! Screaming like that. I don't understand what's gotten into you, Jake, to make you do a thing like that. You're not acting normal. I've lived with too many crazies in my life. I don't want it anymore. I can't handle it. I'm tired of men flipping out on me. Shit, you'd think it was my fault. Well you picked me, remember that. I don't need this. \nThe NEIGHBOR pounds on the wall. \nJEZZIE (continuing) All right! All right! \nJEZZIE jabs her finger at the wall. \nJEZZIE (continuing) If you go crazy on me you're goin' crazy by yourself. You understand? \nJEZZIE reaches for his mouth and pulls out the thermometer. She looks at it closely and then squints to see it better. \nJACOB What's it say? A hundred and two? \nJEZZIE I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor. \nShe runs out of the room. JACOB calls after her. \nJACOB What does it say? \nJEZZIE (V.O.) It's gone to the top. \nJACOB How high is that? \nJEZZIE (V.O.) The numbers stop at 107. \nJEZZIE is on the phone to the doctor in the next room. \nTONY Take his legs. \nSAM Run your hands under hot water. \nMRS. CARMICHAEL comes in. \nMRS. CARMICHAEL I have some ice from the machine. \nJEZZIE Bring it in. \nMRS. CARMICHAEL Is he all right? \nJEZZIE He doesn't like it. \nMRS. CARMICHAEL I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice? \nJEZZIE Pour it in. \nMRS. CARMICHAEL On top of him? \nJEZZIE He's melting it as fast as we dump it in. \nMRS. CARMICHAEL Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy. \nTONY helps her pour the ice into the water. JACOB yells. \nJACOB Oh God! You're killing me! Stop! \nINT.  A BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO JACOB lying in a BEDROOM we have not seen before. He is tossing and turning in his bed as though struggling to get out. Suddenly he sits up and looks over at the window. It is open and the shade is flapping. Cold air is blowing in and he is shivering. \nJACOB Damn! You and your fresh air. \nHe jumps out of bed and goes over to the window. He pushes at the frame and it comes flying down with a loud bang. A woman in the bed sits up. It is SARAH. \nSARAH What was that? \nJACOB It's freezing. \nSARAH I'm not cold. \nJACOB Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed. \nSARAH It's not healthy with it closed. \nJACOB This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy. \nHe settles back into bed and pulls the covers back over to his side. He lies quietly for a moment, thinking. \nJACOB (continuing) What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was? \nSARAH I don't want to know. \nJACOB Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice. \nSARAH Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind? \nJACOB She was good in bed, though. \nSARAH Go to sleep. \nJACOB She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious. \nSARAH I thought you said it was a nightmare? \nSuddenly, out of nowhere, we hear the tinkling sound of a music box. A YOUNG BOY enters the room, carrying a musical LUNCH BOX in his arms. He is wearing a long T-shirt nearly down to his ankles. We recognize him from his photograph. It is GABE. \nGABE Daddy, what was that noise? \nJACOB (surprised to see him) Gabe? (he stares curiously at his son) What are you doing ... ? \nGABE There was a bang. \nJACOB It was the window. \nGABE It's cold. \nJACOB Tell your mother. \nGABE Mom, it's ... \nSARAH I heard you. Go back to sleep. \nGABE Will you tuck me in? \nSARAH (not happily) Oh ... all right. \nShe starts to rise. JACOB stops her and gets up instead. He whisks GABE upside down and carries him into his \nFADE IN sounds of feet shuffling across the carpet. A glass rattles on a tray. A television is on low in the background. Slowly the CAMERA LENS opens from JACOB's P.O.V. and we see JEZZIE puttering around the BEDROOM. Suddenly she is aware that JACOB is watching her. She smiles. \nJEZZIE Jake. (she places her hand on his head and strokes his hair) You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine. \nJACOB Am I home? \nJEZZIE You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil. (she smiles) What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' \"Sarah, close the window,\" over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh? \nJACOB Are we in Brooklyn? \nJEZZIE You're right here, Jake. You just rest. (she puffs up his pillow) The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate. (she strokes his forehead, and gets up) Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up. \nJEZZIE leaves the room. JACOB watches her as she goes. He seems lost and confused. \nINT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY \nJACOB, unshaven, wearing his bathrobe, is sitting at the KITCHEN TABLE. PILES OF BOOKS on demonology are spread out before him. He studies them to distraction. JEZZIE is standing by the counter making sandwiches. She wraps them in plastic Baggies and puts one in a lunch box, another in the refrigerator. She is dressed in her postal uniform. \nJEZZIE You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time. (JEZZIE knocks on JACOB's head) Hello! Anybody home? (she looks in his ear) Anybody in there? \nJACOB What? \nJEZZIE just stares at him. She does not respond. JACOB returns to his books. \nCUT TO CLOSE UP IMAGES OF WINGED DEMONS, real demons, with spindly horns and long tails. JACOB's huge finger, magnified, scans page after page of ancient images and archaic text. JEZZIE, enraged at his lack of attention, returns to packing her lunch box. Suddenly she spins around. \nJEZZIE Goddamn it! I can't stand it anymore. I've had it up to here. Go ahead and rot if you want ... You son-of-a- bitch, I'm talking to you. \nCUT BACK to the DEMONS. Suddenly a crashing sound catches JACOB's attention as a KITCHEN POT flies by his head. He looks up to see JEZZIE knocking pots and pans off the kitchen counter and kicking them wildly across the room. The noise is terrible. The intensity of her rage is shocking. The pots crash into every surface, knocking all his books onto the floor. And then, suddenly, she stops. \nJEZZIE stoops down to the floor and picks up her sandwich, stuffs it back in its plastic Baggie, and puts it back in her lunch box. She is about to leave when she stops and looks at JACOB. \nJEZZIE (continuing, her anger in check) I made you a tuna fish sandwich. It's in the fridge. Eat a carrot with it. The aspirin's on the bottom shelf. We're out of soap so, if for some reason you decide to wash yourself again, use the dishwashing stuff. (she walks out of the room and returns with her coat) I'm sorry I yelled, but you get on my nerves. (she bends down and makes eye contact with JACOB) Hello? Listen, I gotta go. \nJEZZIE sits on his lap, gives him a big kiss, and then, unexpectedly, raises two fingers, like horns, over her head. The gesture catches JACOB's full attention. \nJEZZIE (continuing) Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind. (she kisses his cheek) Love me a little? \nJACOB (speaking with affection) You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up. \nSuddenly the telephone rings. It startles them. \nJEZZIE Oh shit. Tell 'em I've left. \nJEZZIE grabs her jacket and shoves her arm in it upside down. A pocketful of change falls on the floor. JACOB smiles. JEZZIE curses as she struggles to pick it up and get the jacket on right. JACOB gets the phone. \nJACOB Hello. \nPAUL (V.O.) Jacob Singer? \nJACOB Speaking. \nPAUL (V.O.) Paul Gruneger! \nJACOB Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned! \nJACOB indicates it's for him. JEZZIE throws him a kiss goodbye and hurries out the door. \nJACOB (continuing) Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years? \nPAUL (V.O.) A long time. \nJACOB Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life? \nPAUL (V.O.) Nothin' much. \nJACOB Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor? \nPAUL (V.O.) I need to see you, Jake. \nJACOB Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick. \nPAUL (V.O.) I need to see you. \nINT.  PAUL'S CAR - DAY \nJACOB and PAUL are driving through EAST NEW YORK heading toward WILLIAMSBURG. The elevated trains rumble above them. JACOB pats PAUL on the back. \nJACOB Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds. \nPAUL I work in a bakery. \nJACOB You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed? \nPAUL Count 'em on one hand. \nJACOB It's almost like a conspiracy, huh? \nPAUL No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it. \nJACOB Everywhere, like a plague. \nPAUL God almighty. I thought I was the only one. \nJACOB Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams. \nPAUL Oh God. I know. I know. \nJACOB What is it Paul? What's happening to me? \nPAUL They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire. (he fumbles in his coat pocket and pulls out a small Bible and silver cross) I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army. \nJACOB (stunned) The army? \nPAUL She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us? \nJACOB I don't know. I don't know. \nPAUL They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something. \nJACOB leans back in the booth, his mind racing. The YOUNG MAN in the next booth is watching them with rapt attention. \nINT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY \nPAUL and JACOB are in the MEN'S ROOM. PAUL flushes the urinal. \nPAUL I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home. \nJACOB You come home with me. \nPAUL What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind? \nJACOB Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there. \nPAUL smiles. \nEXT.  BAR - DAY \nThe TWO MEN leave the bar on a dingy side street. It is cold outside. Christmas lights seem ludicrous dangling in the bar's front window. PAUL looks at them and smiles. \nPAUL Merry Christmas. \nPAUL steps into the street and walks to the driver's side of his car. He pulls out his keys and opens the door. JACOB looks down on the sidewalk and notices a dime. \nJACOB Goddamn, this is my lucky day. \nHe bends down to pick it up. PAUL inserts the key into the ignition and steps on the gas. He turns the key. \nTHE CAR EXPLODES. Pieces of metal and flesh fly into the air. JACOB sprawls out flat on the ground as the debris hurls above him. He covers his head. \nEXT.  VIETNAM \nCUT TO A HELICOPTER suffering an air bombardment. Flack is exploding all around it and the shock waves are rocking the craft violently. JACOB's eyes peer to the left. \nINFANTRY GUNNERS are firing rockets into the JUNGLE below. A pair of MEDICS are huddled over him. A sudden gush of arterial bleeding sends a stream of blood splattering over the inside of the windshield. The PILOT, unable to see, clears it away with his hands. \nJACOB screams over the roar of the chopper. One of the MEDICS presses his ear close to JACOB to hear. \nJACOB Help me! \nMEDIC We're doing the best we can. \nJACOB Get me out of here! \nEXT.  BAR - DAY \nTHE YOUNG MAN from the bar grabs JACOB under the arms and drags him down the sidewalk. \nYOUNG MAN Just hold on. \nJACOB Where am I? Who are you? \nThe YOUNG MAN yanks JACOB around the corner just as another explosion consumes the car. The air is filled with flames and flying debris. The YOUNG MAN pulls JACOB into the bar. \nYOUNG MAN Just lie still. You're okay. You're not hurt. \nThe CUSTOMERS are in a state of bedlam. Part of the wall has blown apart and bricks and glass are everywhere. The cross from around PAUL's neck is buried in the debris. Sirens are heard in the distance. A BLACK CAR speeds off down the street. JACOB looks for the YOUNG MAN who had helped him. He is gone. \nEXT.  FUNERAL PROCESSION - DAY \nA FUNERAL PROCESSION heads down Ocean Parkway. \nINT.  JACOB'S CAR - DAY \nJACOB and JEZZIE are driving in an old Chevy Nova. They are dressed up. JACOB's face is bruised and he has a gauze pad over his ear. They drive in silence. JACOB appears very sad. Slowly his right hand reaches across the seat, seeking JEZZIE's. Their fingers embrace. \nEXT.  CEMETERY - DAY \nThe FUNERAL PROCESSION enters the CEMETERY. Cars park along the length of the narrow road. MEN IN DARK SUITS emerge from their cars along with WIVES and GIRLFRIENDS. \nJACOB Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this. \nFRANK There's nothing to expose. \nJACOB Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you? (silence) What's going on? How can you just turn away? (no response) What about the others? \nFRANK They're not interested, Jake. \nJACOB Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know? \nFRANK (pausing) Maybe it's not the army, Jake. \nJACOB What do you mean? \nFRANK Maybe there's a larger truth. \nJACOB What are you talking about? \nFRANK Maybe the demons are real. \nJACOB Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that? \nFRANK Listen, Jake. I gotta go. \nJACOB What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ? \nFRANK I'm hanging up. \nJACOB Hey, wait! \nFRANK Don't bother to call again, okay? \nFRANK hangs up. JACOB stands holding the phone for a long time, until the high pitched whine from the receiver reminds him it's off the hook. The sound frightens him and he slams the receiver down. QUickly JACOB tears through his address book looking for other phone numbers. They aren't there. \nJACOB Shit! \nINT.  JACOB'S APT. \nJACOB hurries into the BEDROOM and pulls an old shoe box from the closet. The box is filled with yellowing army papers, dog tags, and photos of old comrades. Beneath his discharge papers he finds a sheet scribbled with the names and addresses of platoon buddies. JACOB grabs it. Then his eyes fall on the frayed remains of an old letter. He picks it up and unfolds it with great care. The letter is written in a child's handwriting. \"DEAR DADDY, I LOVE YOU. PLEASE COME HOME. JED GOT A FROG. ELI LOST MY KEY. MOM WANTS YOU TO SEND HER MONEY. LOVE, GABE.\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - DAY \nGABE, on a BICYCLE, is rushing down the sidewalk. JACOB is running alongside him, holding onto the seat. Plastic streamers trail from the handlebars. GABE is a bit wobbly, but determined. After a couple of false starts, JACOB lets go and GABE is riding by himself. For an instant, GABE looks back at his father with a huge grin on his face. JACOB is grinning, too. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON GABE as he pulls away from us and heads into the distance. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT \nJACOB swallows hard as he stands there, holding the letter. Suddenly his eyes lift off the page and glance at a full length mirror mounted on the bedroom door. Something in the mirror, like the image of a child, seems to move. He looks over. There is nothing there. Curious, JACOB walks toward the mirror. As his image appears, he gasps and stops moving. To his horror and ours, it is his own back that is reflected in the mirror. The impossibility of the moment startles him. He lifts his hand. The reflection moves with him. Frightened but defiant, JACOB moves toward the mirror. The image in the mirror spins around. It is the  FRIGHTENING VIBRATING FACE he saw at the party with JEZZIE. An unearthly scream comes from both their mouths. \nJACOB NO!!! \nINT.  BROOKLYN COURT HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA huge wooden door slams open. JACOB charges through it. \nHe is chasing his lawyer, DONALD GEARY, through a crowded court house corridor. GEARY, sweaty and unshaven, is cradling a Coke in one hand, a sandwich and a briefcase in the other. His stomach bounces wildly as he walks. \nJACOB Geary! Mr. Geary! Listen, goddamn it! You can't just walk away from this. \nGEARY keeps walking. JACOB catches up to him. \nJACOB (continuing) Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh? \nGEARY Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay? \nJACOB grabs the back of GEARY's jacket and pulls him up short. \nGEARY (continuing) Take your hands off me! \nJACOB lets go. He stares into GEARY's eyes. \nJACOB Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you. \nGEARY You need ... a doctor. \nJACOB A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something. \nGEARY gives JACOB a pitiful look. \nGEARY There's nothing I can do. \nHe turns and walks away. JACOB stands there a moment, and then rushes after him. GEARY is biting into his sandwich. \nMayonnaise spills onto his hand. He licks it with his tongue. JACOB catches up to him. \nGEARY You mind? I'm eating, huh? \nBEARER No waller. Nothing. \nJACOB They stole it. \nRESIDENT Who did? \nJACOB I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had. \nRESIDENT We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call? \nNURSE I'll page him. \nJACOB Call my chiropractor. \nNURSE We're doing everything we can. \nJACOB Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue. \nRESIDENT I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little. \nJACOB No. Don't move me. \nThe RESIDENT ignores him. JACOB screams. \nRESIDENT I don't have to ask if you can feel that. \nJACOB Goddamn it. I want Louis. \nNURSE Who's Louis? \nRESIDENT He's out of it. I'm taking him down to X-ray. \nAn ORDERLY pushes the gurney through a pair of sliding doors. JACOB tries to get up but the pain keeps him immobilized. \nINT.  CORRIDORS - NIGHT \nJACOB begins a journey down what appears to be an endless series of corridors. The wheels of the gurney turn with a hypnotic regularity. The smooth tile floor gives way to roguh cement. The ORDERLY's feet plod through pools of blood that coagulate in cracks and crevices along the way. The surface grows rougher, the wheels more insistent. Body parts and human bile splash against the walls as the gurney moves faster. \nJACOB Where are you taking me? Where am I? \nORDERLY You know where you are. \nJACOB, panicked, tries again to get up but to no effect. He glances to the side and sees mournful CREATURES being led into dark rooms. No one fights or struggles. We hear muffled screams from behind closed doors. Occasionally he glances inside the rooms and sees mangled bodies in strange contraptions, people in rusty iron lungs, and hanging from metal cages. Dark eyes peer out in horror. In one room a baseboard heater bursts into flame. No one seems concerned. A door opens. A bicycle with plastic streamers on the handlebars lies crushed and mangled. One of its wheels is still spinning. JACOB cries out but it is not his voice we hear. Rather it is a familiar unearthly roar. His whole body stiffens. As he rounds the corner he sees a figure, its head vibrating in endless terror. it is the same image he has seen before. JACOB screams. \nINT.  ROOM - NIGHT \nJACOB is wheeled into a tiny ROOM. A numer of \"DOCTORS\" are waiting. As they draw closer JACOB notices that something about them is not right. They bear a subtle resemblance to Bosch-like DEMONS, creatures of another world. JACOB tries to sit up but winces in pain. He cannot move. He tries to scream but no sound comes out. \nChains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They are lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to JACOB's arms and legs. He screams. \nJACOB Oh God! \nThe \"DOCTORS\" laugh. There is the sound of a huge door closing. JACOB is left in semi-darkness. Suddenly a new group of \"DOCTORS\" emerges from the shadows. They are carrying sharp surgical instruments. They surround JACOB, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. JACOB is panting and sweating in fear. One of the \"DOCTORS\" leans over JACOB. He gasps with horror. It is JEZZIE. \nJACOB JEZZIE! \nShe pays no attention to him. He stares at her, THE CAMERA TILTING DOWN HER BODY. As it gets to her foot we see it is a decaying mass, swarming with maggots. The \"DOCTORS\" laugh. They take great pleasure in his suffering. Their voices are strange and not human. Each utterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere and compassionate, taunting and mocking at the same time. The confusion of meanings is a torment of its own. \nJACOB (continuing) Get me out of here. \n\"DOCTOR\" Where do you want to go? \nJACOB Take me home. \n\"DOCTOR\" Home? (they all laugh) This is your home. You're dead. \nJACOB Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead. \n\"DOCTOR\" What are you then? \nJACOB I'm alive. \n\"DOCTOR\" Then what are you doing here? \nJACOB I don't know. I don't know. (he struggles like an animal) This isn't happening. \n\"DOCTOR\" What isn't happening? \nJACOB Let me out of here! \n\"DOCTOR\" There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember? \nA \"DOCTOR\" approaches JACOB. As he turns, we notice with horror that he has no eyes or eye sockets. He extracts a long needle from his belt and positions it over JACOB's head. Like a divining rod it locates a particular point near the crown of his head. With a powerful thrust the \"DOCTOR\" shoves the needle into JACOB's skull and pushes it slowly into his brain. JACOB howls. \nEXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT \nCUT RAPIDLY TO VIETNAM and a replay of flashes of the opening sequence of the film. SOLDIERS with bayonets are charging over rice paddies in the dark of the night. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS charges at JACOB with a long bayonet blade and jams it into his intestines. JACOB cries out. \nINT.  ROOM - NIGHT \nJEZZIE It's just me. \nJACOB Jezzie? \nJEZZIE Who else were you expecting? \nJACOB Let go! \nJEZZIE Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called? \nJACOB Stay away from me, Jez. \nJEZZIE I want to know. You tell me! \nJACOB You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news! \nHe pushes her away and jumps out of the shower. \nCUT TO JACOB dressing and piling the last of his clothes into his suitcase. JEZZIE, in a robe, is watching him. \nJEZZIE Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that. \nJACOB I can do anything I want. \nShe stares at him with confusion. THE PHONE RINGS. \nJACOB Don't! \nJEZZIE It might be for me. \nJACOB I'm not here. You haven't seen me. \nJEZZIE (picking up the receiver) Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what? (JACOB looks up) Vietnam? ... What experiments? \nJACOB lunges for the phone. \nJACOB Hello. This is Jacob Singer. (he listens with growing fascination) God almighty! ... Yes. Yes. Right. Where would you like to meet? (he listens) How will I know you. (JACOB seems uncomfortable) Okay. I'll be there. \nHe hangs up the phone and stands silently for a moment. \nJEZZIE Who was that? \nJACOB A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him. \nJEZZIE How? \nJACOB I have no idea. (he thinks) I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God. \nJEZZIE How do you know he's telling the truth? \nJACOB stares at JEZZIE for several moments but does not respond. The 11:00 NEWS is coming on. JACOB's image can be seen on the screen. We hear the NEWSCASTER speaking. \nNEWSCASTER Leading the news tonight, a bizarre demonstration on the steps of the U.S. Army Recruiting Headquarters, in downtown Manhattan. Jacob Singer, an alleged Vietnam vet ... \nJACOB Alleged? Alleged? \nNEWSCASTER ... challenged the United States Army to admit conducting secret experi- ments involving hundreds of American soldiers during the Vietnam war. \nJEZZIE stares at the T.V., dumbfounded. JACOB takes his suitcase and hurries to the front door. He opens it a crack and peers into the hallway. JEZZIE runs after him. \nJEZZIE (almost threatening) Don't leave me, Jake. \nINT.  BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nJACOB gazes at JEZZIE for a moment and then hurries down the HALL. He stops at the stairwell and looks back. JEZZIE is still standing there. She is very angry. JACOB just stares at her for a moment and then disappears down the stairwell. \nEXT.  WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nJACOB is standing near the WESTSIDE HIGHWAY. GROUPS OF MEN in black leather jackets are crusing the area and look at JACOB with curiosity. One MAN in particular cruises by several times and then approaches him. \nMICHAEL Jacob? Hi. I'm Michael Newman. Friends call me Mike. \nJACOB is startled when he sees him. He is the same YOUNG MAN who has appeared throughout the film, assisting JACOB in moments of crisis. \nMICHAEL (continuing) Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight. \nJACOB I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me? \nMICHAEL Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You were one of the survivors. \nA POLICE CAR passes them on the street. MICHAEL grabs JACOB's shoulder and turns him away nervously. \nMICHAEL (continuing) Come on, we're not safe around here. \nHUDSON RIVER PIER - NIGHT \nJACOB and MICHAEL are sitting on a deserted WEST SIDE PIER that juts into the Hudson River. JACOB is wide-eyed as he listens to MICHAEL's story. \nMICHAEL So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68. \nJEZZIE Oh yeah? (her eyes twinkle suggestively) Try leavin' without me. \nJACOB laughs. JEZZIE doesn't. Unexpectedly she grabs JACOB and pushes him onto the bed. In seconds they are all over each other, their clothes flying in all directions. They seem as happy as could be. \nOMIT \nINT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY \nJACOB enters GRAND CENTRAL STATION. He checks out all the PEOPLE around him. Not a DEMON in sight. Hurrying to the TICKET WINDOW he gets in line. The TICKET SELLER looks up. \nJACOB Chicago. One way. For tomorrow. \nSELLER How many? \nJACOB One. \nSELLER That'll be $119.75. \nJACOB pulls out MICHAEL's credit card. The SELLER rings it up. While he is waiting JACOB notices a POLICEMAN looking at him. The stare unsettles him. The SELLER hands JACOB his ticket. He takes it and hurries into the CROWD. Looking back he notices the POLICEMAN is following him. \nINT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY \nJACOB enters the MEN'S ROOM. He hurries into one of the stalsls, drops his pants, and sits. He eyes the graffiti on the walls and then notices a wad of tissue stuffed into a hole between him and the next stall. It is moving. Suddenly the tissue falls to the floor. JACOB glances at the hole curiously and leans forward to examine it. He is shocked to see an eye staring back at him. \nJACOB Goddamn it! (he covers it with his hand. A pencil jabs his palm. He yells) Fucking pervert. \nTwo lips form around the hole. A tongue wags obscenely. \nVOICE Dream on! \nJACOB (shocked) What?! \nThe mouth is gone. JACOB hears the stall door fly open and feet running from the room. He jumps up and grabs his pants. He dashes out of the MEN'S ROOM. He hears footsteps and chases after them. \nINT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY \nJACOB bursts into the MAIN TERMINAL. He sees someone rushing toward the main doors and speeds after him. HOMELESS PEOPLE, huddling along the corridors, watch as they run past. Escaping to the street, the MAN disappears in the holiday throngs. JACOB, crazed, stands gasping for breath. His fists dig into his coat pocket. Suddenly he feels something and seems surprised when MICHAEL's CARD emerges in his hands. \nOMIT \nINT.  SOHO LOFT BUILDING - EVENING \nJACOB runs up the stairs in a SOHO LOFT BUILDING. It is a dingy, industrial staircase, poorly lit. He reaches a door with MICHAEL's name painted on it in large black letters. He knocks loudly. There is no answer. He pounds on it. Another door opens on the floor above. A head sticks out. \nMAN You lookin' for Mike? \nJACOB (panting hard) Where is he? \nMAN Don't know. Hasn't picked his mail up in days. It's not like him. \nJACOB has a frenzied look in his eyes. He searches around the staircase and sees a pile of lumber stacked in a corner. He grabs a two-by-four and lunges at the door. \nMAN What the hell are you doing? \nJACOB doesn't answer. He smashes wildly at the door until the lock flies open. \nINT.  MICHAEL'S LOFT - EVENING \nJACOB charges into the dark space groping for a light. He finds it. The LOFT is a disaster area. Nothing is standing. JACOB runs from room to room. In the back he discovers a large private chemistry lab. Glass vials and bottles are shattered on the floor. \nJACOB rifles through the cabinets. A few bottles are intact but their labels mean nothing to him. \nHe reaches for one cabinet and notices a reddish liquid oozing out from the bottom. He opens it. MICHAEL's severed head stares him in the face. It is smiling. \nA scream rings out as the MAN from upstairs sees what JACOB has seen. JACOB jumps back, trips, and falls over MICHAEL's headless body. It is lying sprawled across the floor. \nMAN Oh my God! \nJACOB stumbles to pull himself up. He is in a state of unrelieved panic. He runs past the MAN and spills out the doorr. He takes two and three stairs at a time, nearly flying to the street. \nEXT.  SOHO STREETS - NIGHT \nJACOB rushes into the icy air and runs wildly down the sidewalk as fast as his legs will move. With unexpected violence he charges into the side of a building. Over and over he hurls himself against it. He grabs for the bricks. His fingers insert themselves into the crevices. It is as though he is trying to merge with the wall. \nSuddenly JACOB turns and dashes into the street. A taxi is speeding toward him, its lights the only sign of life and warmth in the dark night. JACOB steps into its path. It is hard to tell if he is trying to stop the cab or waiting to be hit. The taxi screeches to a halt. JACOB stares at it a moment and then steps to get in. The DRIVER tries to pull off but JACOB yanks at the door and drags himself inside. \nINT.  TAXI - NIGHT \nRain is beginning to fall. It streaks the windows. \nJACOB (barely audible) I'm going to Brooklyn. \nDRIVER Sorry, Mac. Not with me you're not. I get lost in Brooklyn. \nJACOB I know the way. \nJACOB reaches into his pants pocket, pulls out a twenty dollar bill, and hands it to the DRIVER. He takes it. \nJACOB (continuing) Look, this is all the money I've got in the world. Take me home and it's yours. \nJACOB pauses a moment and then turns to confront the terror behind him. \nJACOB WHO ARE YOU? \nJEZZIE How many times have you asked me that? How many times? \nJACOB TELL ME, DAMN YOU! \nJEZZIE (with consummate power) YOU KNOW WHO I AM. \nJEZZIE appears from the shadows. Her coat collar obscures her and it seems for a moment that she has no face. Then, to JACOB's horror, she turns around. He is staring at the vibrating creature he has seen so often before. Glimpsed almost in abstraction it is a living terror, dark and undefinable. Its face is a black and impenetrable void in constant vibration. Its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry, the essence of fear and suffering. JACOB pulls away from it, overhwelmed by confusion. He is rooted in fear. \nA sudden wind howls through the room, great gales blowing JACOB's hair straight up. It is like a hurricane pushing him into the wall. He can barely stand. He struggles to pull himself away. The flapping sound returns, charging at him from all directions. It is as if the darkness itself is swooping down, trying to envelop him. \nJACOB (whispering to himself) This isn't happening. \nNew terrible sounds arise, chain saws slashing through the air, knives, and sabers ripping through space with unrelenting anger. Guns fire and explode past his head. It is as though all the sounds of destruction are closing in on him. JACOB yells but his own voice is lost in the melee. Terrified, he looks heavenward, as if crying for help. \nSuddenly, from the noise, a calm voice rises, speaking, as if from a distance. It is LOUIS. JACOB is shocked to hear him. He stands motionless. \nLOUIS (V.O.) If you're frightened of dying you'll see devils tearing you apart. If you've made your peace then they're angels freeing you from the world. \nThe voice fades. JACOB just stands there, not sure what to do. And then the sounds return. Only now they are more terrifying than ever. Hideously loud, they become a cacophony of sounds, voices of parents, friends, lovers, the sounds of battle, fighting, and dying. \nJACOB looks up and sees the creature in the center of the room. All the sounds seem to emenate from it. The more JACOB stares at it the louder they become. After a moment, JACOB takes a huge breath. We sense a great resolve forming inside him. Then, slowly, courageously, he begins moving toward it. \nNEw and more terrifying noises assault JACOB, attempting to drive him back, but he will not be stopped. He continues walking toward the creature. \nIn the hallway a standing lamp slams sparking to the floor. It rolls back and forth like a living thing, with a maddening hypnotic regularity. Doors slam open and closed, unlatching, snapping, shutting, with deafening force. The room itself seems like an organic presence. It is alive, angry, and threatening. \nThe CREATURE sits in the midst of the insanity like the source of madness itself. It writhes, contorts and vibrates with unstoppable fury. JACOB, terrified, but unrelenting, continues to approach it. \nAS THE CAMERA DRAWS CLOSER TO THE CREATURE'S HEAD the density of its featureless form overwhelms the screen. It is like staring into emptiness itself, the ultimate darkness. \nWith superhuman effort JACOB grabs hold of the creature. It is like grabbing hold of a live wire. His body begins shaking uncontrollably like a man being electrocuted. He is flying in all directions but does not let go. His fingers claw at the creature's head. JACOB struggles defiantly with the monster. \nSuddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it. \nCREATURE WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FIGHTING! \nJACOB does not respond. It cries out again. \nCREATURE WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FIGHTING? \nDeep inside the darkness JACOB begins to make out the presence of a form, something writhing and tortured lurking before us. It looks briefly like an animal until we realize it is the image of a human face. It is covered by a dark suffocating film, like a mask. \nJACOB digs into it with all his might and pulls it off. \nCUT TO: \nDEAD SILENCE as JACOB SEES HIS OWN FACE staring back at him from beneath the mask. It is JACOB SINGER as we first saw him on the battlefield in Vietnam. Only now his image is pale and lifeless. It takes JACOB a moment to realize that he is dead. The recognition is one of terrible confusion and pain. JACOB stares at himself for a long time as a huge cry wells up inside him. It bursts forth with devastating sadness. \nAs that instant the whole of space seems to explode in a flash of catacylsmic power. Hundreds of images from JACOB's life flash before us, his birth, his childhood, his adulthood. The demons, the room, JEZZIE, LOUIS, MICHAEL, SARAH, all seem to assail us in a rush of blinding intensity. \nWe are flying over a landscape of memories, zooming across a constantly changing field of images. Some of the images move, some of the people in them speak. They are not particularly significant memories, in some ways they are quite banal, but something about them is infused with life and joy. Even the painful moments resonate with vital force. Some of the moments we recognize from the time we've spent with JACOB. Some we have not seen before. There is no order to them, no logic to why they have been recalled. \nA newborn baby takes its first breath and screams. SARAH pulls clothes off a clothes line on a rainy day. JACOB's FATHER stands in the Florida surf as sea foam laps gently at his legs. PAUL, FRANK, and JACOB play cards on the edge of a rice paddy. GABE rides his bike into the path of an oncoming car. A child puts his ear next to a bowl of cereal, listening to it talk. A young girl standing in a doorway lifts up her blouse to show her new breasts. JACOB and SARAH slice a wedding cake that topples to the floor. JEZZIE looks at JACOB and asks \"Love me a little?\" \nAnd then it is over. Total silence overwhelms the screen, a wonderful soothing calm. JACOB's eyes open and he is shocked to find himself sitting on the floor in SARAH's apartment. He is all alone. The first rays of early morning sunlight are filtering through the window. Something about the apartment seems transfigured, magical. JACOB sits motionless, stunned to be back there. \nThe faint sound of music can be heard coming from the hallway. It is warm and familiar, the tinkling of a music box. JACOB listens to it for a few moments and then something registers inside him. Curious, he gets up and approaches the corridor. \nJACOB Hello? \nThere is no response. Suddenly the music stops. JACOB freezes for a moment. He sees someone standing in the shadows at the other end. \nJACOB (continuing) Who is it? Who's there? \nTentatively JACOB moves forward. As he draws closer he begins to see the outline of a child. Then, all of a sudden, he realizes who it is. His eyes well up as he stands there, the full impact of the moment registering inside him. It's his son, GABE. He is carrying the same musical lunch box we have seen before. The young boy smiles warmly at his father. It is the smile of an angel. JACOB swallows hard. \nJACOB (continuing) Gabe? Gabe! \nJACOB runs to his son. Unable to hold back the tears, he embraces him in a rush of love and emotion. \nJACOB (continuing) Gabe. Oh God. I don't believe ... \nThey hug one another over and over. JACOB, overcome, sits down on the stiars. After a moment GABE puts his arm around his father's shoulder in a gesture of surprising maturity and compassion. We sense for an instant that their roles have reversed. GABE reaches for JACOB's hand and gently encourages him to stand up. \nWith a sweet tug GABE leads his father up the steps. \nSunlight streams down from the top of the stiars, hitting the first landing. GABE is bathed in its warm glow. As JACOB reaches the landing, he too is surrounded by the comforting light. \nGABE hurries up the last set of stairs. JACOB turns to follow but is stunned by the brilliance of the light pouring in from above. Squinting, he cannot see his son. Then suddenly GABE steps back out of the light and takes his father's hand once more. His eyes sparkle with excitement. \nGABE Come on Dad ... You know what we've got? A sandbox just like the Williston's, only it's bigger and the sand's all white. You won't believe it. \nJACOB smiles at his son. GABE smiles at him. It is a moment of total euphoria. THE CAMERA HOLDS as they continue up the stairs. \nGABE (continuing) And my parakeet. Remember, the one grandma let out of the cage? He's okay. And he's talking now. He knows my name. \nSTERN (he smiles) Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it? \nJACOB Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft. (STERN nods his head. They walk a moment in silence) I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos. \nSTERN (looking at JACOB with affection) Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. (he pauses) Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with? \nJACOB (smiling coyly) I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady. \nSTERN (with a fatherly demeanor) Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it. \nINT.  OFF CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nJACOB and PROFESSOR STERN are sitting at a quiet table in a nearly empty coffee shop. They are both fixing cups of tea, not speaking. Suddenly JACOB looks at STERN. \nJACOB I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean. (STERN looks at him questioningly) I need to know about ... demons. \nSTERN (surprised) Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ? \nJACOB No. (he pauses a moment) I see them. \nSTERN See them? (he smiles uncomforta- bly) What do you mean? Physically? \nJACOB (hesitantly) Yes. \nSTERN pauses. He looks at JACOB. The intensity of his gaze is unsettling and JACOB reaches for his tea. The cup rattles. \nSTERN I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob, (he pauses) this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now. \nJACOB I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life. \nA look of concern fills STERN's eyes. \nJACOB (continuing) Christ, I know how it sounds. \nSTERN Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist? \nJACOB Yes. (suddenly uneasy) I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis. (he pauses uncomforta- bly) It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to. \nSTERN I don't know what to say. \nJACOB I need your insight, your intuition. \nSTERN sips his tea slowly. He is thinking. \nSTERN Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit? \nJACOB I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense. (he pauses) Please help me. \nSTERN (trying to be delicate) Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves. \nJACOB (disturbed) But I see them. \nSTERN Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob. (he muses) You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint. \nJACOB Hell, you think I am? \nSTERN I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been \"elected\" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing. \nJACOB gazes at his old friend and mentor, frustration blazing in his eyes. They are both surprised to see tears form and run down his cheek. JACOB reaches for a napkin and dries them quickly. STERN, uncomfortable in the face of emotion, turns away. \nADDENDUM 2: THE PARTY AT DELLA'S \nSuddenly a strange and terrifying spectacle unfolds before him. The DANCERS undergo a shocking transformation, a full three- dimensional alteration of their physical forms. Clothes fuse to their bodies like new skin. Horns and tails emerge and grow like exotic genitalia, exciting a frenzy among the DANCERS. New appendages appear unfolding from their flesh. Dorsal fins protrude from their backs. Armored scales run in scallops down their legs. Tails entwine sensuously. Long tongues lick at the undersides of reptilian bellies. The metamorphosis holds a biological fascination. Bones and flesh mold into new forms of life, creatures of another world. \nCUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief. He stares at the DANCERS. They are perverse, corrupt aspects of their normal selves. He is mesmerized by JEZZIE. Her flesh has grown hard and wrinkled and has the markings of a snake. Her tongue, long and curled, darts in and out of her mouth repeatedly. Her eyes are thin and domineering. They lock JACOB in their gaze. He wants to stop, to run, but JEZZIE won't release him. \nJACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from them but it won't go away. The music throbs. His actions become spastic, almost delirious. His hysteria attracts the attention of the other DANCERS. \nA circle forms around JACOB and JEZZIE as their frenzy transcends the boundaries of dance and erupts into an almost orgiastic display. JACOB is out of control. His fury becomes a kind of exorcism, a desperate attempt to free himself from his body and his mind. \nCUT TO JACOB as his eyes pass beyond pain. The dark walls of the APARTMENT fade away. \nEXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT \nStrange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness, outlined by a bright moon that is emerging from behind a large cloud. The faces are looking down and voices are speaking. \nVOICE He's burning up. \nVOICE Total delirium. \nVOICE He'll never make it. \nVOICE That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out. \nVOICE Push 'em back. \nJACOB (V.O.) (crying weakly) Help me! \nHis eyes focus on the moon. Rings of light emanate from it filling the sky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings draw us forward with a quickening intensity that grows into exhilarating speed. The rush causes them to flash stroboscopically and produce a dazzling, almost sensual, surge of color. The display is spectacular and compelling. A voice can be heard in the distance. \nJEZZIE wraps herself around his shivering body and warms him with her own. The image seems tender and comforting until we notice JEZZIE's tongue darting nervously in and out. It looks strangely like a snake's. \nADDENDUM 6: THE HOSPITAL \nThe RESIDENT injects the serum into JACOB's veins while two ORDERLIES hold him still. JACOB barely struggles. His eyes fixate on the EMERGENCY ROOM WALL. It is white and sterile. Within moments it begins to emit a reddish glow. JACOB watches with astonishment as the wall's two-dimensional surface separates into three-dimensional planes. The solid surface gives way to a DARK CHAMBER that was not there before. \nOut of the transmuted space CREATURES begin to form. Bosch-like DEMONS with horns and tails, undeniably of another world. Slowly several of them emerge from the wall and approach JACOB. They look like parodies of doctors and nurses, wearing traditional hospital gowns. Without a word they wheel him through the space where the wall had been. JACOB tries to scream but no sound comes out. \nINT.  HELL - NIGHT \nThe DARK CHAMBER is filled with mournful CREATURES being led by DEMONS through a series of CORRIDORS. No one fights or struggles. JACOB's stretcher is moved through the darkness. He tries to sit up but is forced back down. He is obviously drugged. \nJACOB is wheeled into a tiny CHAMBER. A number of DEMONS are waiting for him. Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They are lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to JACOB's arms and legs. The devices are manipulated smoothly and JACOB is lifted off the stretcher. The chains retract, stretching him spread-eagle in the air. He screams loudly. \nJACOB Oh God! \nThe DEMONS laugh. There is the sound of a huge door closing. JACOB is left in darkness. The darkness is hallucinogenic. Fires appear beyond the boundaries of the wall; images of Dante's Inferno, souls of the dead in endless torment. JACOB is but one of countless beings sharing a vastness of torment. His own screams for help are lost in the magnitude of voices crying. \nSuddenly, out of the meancing shadows, a contingent of DEMONS emerges. They are carrying sharp surgical instruments. They surround JACOB, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. JACOB is panting and sweating with fear. For an instant, one of the DEMONS looks like JEZZIE. JACOB calls out to her. \nJACOB Jezzie! Help me! \nThe DEMONS laugh as she changes form. They take great pleasure in his suffering. Their voices are strange and not human. Each utterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere and compassionate, taunting and mocking at the same time. The confusion of meanings is a torment of its own. \nADDENDUM 7: JACOB'S BEDROOM \nINT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM \nJACOB is lying on the floor of his BEDROOM doing exercises for his back. He has several days' growth of beard and does not look well. His mind is drifting and only the occasional pain in his back reminds him of what he is doing. JEZZIE can be heard vacuuming the carpet in the LIVING ROOM. Suddenly the door swings open. The wail of the vacuum cleaner causes JACOB to tense. His eyes drift down from the ceiling. JEZZIE vacuums around him and seems insensitive to his presence. \nJEZZIE shoves the vacuum cleaner under the bed and hits something. JACOB tightens. She looks and is shocked to discover a can of gasoline and boxes of kitchen matches. It takes her a second to understand the implications of what she has found. JACOB is ready when she begins yelling. \nJEZZIE You're completely off your rocker, you know that? You'd think you fell on your head instead of your back. What are you planning to do, burn down the apartment along with your demons? \nShe begins to remove the gasoline can. \nJACOB (yelling) Don't you touch it. (he glares at her) \nJEZZIE lets go of the can and grabs the vacuum. She moves it furiously across the carpet. Suddenly JACOB sees her tongue darting in and out, unconsciously. She looks strange, not human. JACOB freezes. He yells out. \nJACOB Who are you? \nThe sound of the vacuum cleaner drowns out his voice. He yells again. JEZZIE sees him and turns off the machine. His voice booms out. \nJACOB (continuing) Who the hell are you? \nJEZZIE ignores the question and turns the vacuum cleaner back on. JACOB rolls over and pulls out the plug. \nJACOB Why won't you answer me? \nJEZZIE (angry) Cause you know goddamn well who I am. \nJACOB I don't know you. \nJEZZIE You've lived with me for two years. \nJACOB That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana. \nJEZZIE What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy? \nJACOB You know goddamn well what I mean. \nJEZZIE You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you. \nJACOB Well leave then. Go to Hell. \nJEZZIE (furious) You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing! \nShe storms out of the room, kicking the vacuum cleaner as she goes. JACOB can see flashes of her through the open crack of the bedroom door. Occasional curses and epithets hurl through the opening along with a flood of tears. \nJACOB catches glimpses of her as she grabs her coat from the hall closet and as she pulls her money out of the desk drawer. He can see the lamp as she shoves it to the floor and hears it shatter as she stomps on it with her foot. There is a blur as she heads to the front door and a deafening bang as she leaves. \nJACOB's eyes drift up to the ceiling. They hardly blink. He stares at the plaster, chipped and cracked, above him. Suddenly the cracks begin to move. JACOB jumps up. A DEMON is materializing over his head. JACOB yells and grabs hold of the extension pole for the vacuum cleaner. With a furious cry he begins jamming it at the ceiling. Rather than blot out the evolving image his attack helps to define it. JACOB slams harder. Plaster and wood lath cover the floor. The DEMON is gone. Panting hard, JACOB reaches for matches and the gasoline can. He stops and stares at them with great intensity. \nADDENDUM 8: THE ANTIDOTE SEQUENCE \nThe ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge crevasses tear through the plaster. JACOB's world is crumbling. He stares in horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the rupture above him. Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness. Hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through. \nJACOB (continuing) HELP ME! \nInstantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding the vial with the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds it over JACOB's mouth. \nMICHAEL Take it! \nJACOB fights him but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the eyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit it out, but can't. \nSuddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break off and collide with one another like continental plates. The collisions wreak havoc on the DEMONS, chopping and dismembering them. Body parts fall from the ceiling like a Devil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side. \nFlashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering like a war in the heavens. It is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe. It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes. \nJEZZIE Jake, don't leave me! \nJACOB throws the chair at the floor, opens the door, and hurries into the HALLWAY. JEZZIE scurries around the chair and runs to the door. She yells after him, but he is already gone. \nADDENDUM 10: THE END OF THE MOVIE \nINT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT \nJACOB stoops in front of the APARTMENT door and reaches his hand underneath a section of the hallway carpet. It comes back with a key. He inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door. \nJACOB (calling out) Hello. It's me. \nINT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe lights are on and the APARTMENT looks comfortable and cozy. \nJACOB Hello? Is anyone home? Jed? Elie? Dad- dy's here. \nThere is still no answer. JACOB is surprised. He walks into the LIVING ROOM and then the KITCHEN. No one is around. He walks into his old BEDROOM and then the BOYS' ROOM. He is surprised to hear footsteps coming down the hall. He turns around and calls out. \nJACOB Sarah, is that you? I hope you don't mind. I needed to come home. \nJACOB is startled to see JEZZIE enter the room. She does not seem to be her usual self. She seems larger, more imposing. \nJEZZIE Hello, Jake. I knew you'd come here in the end. \nJACOB is nervous. \nJACOB Where's Sarah? Where are the boys? \nJEZZIE Sit down, Jake. \nJACOB Where are they? \nJEZZIE Sit down! \nJACOB No! What's going on? Where's my family? \nJEZZIE It's over, Jake. It's all over. \nJACOB Where have they gone? \nJEZZIE Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished. \nJEZZIE stares at JACOB with a frightening, powerful glare. Her lips snarl. Her tongue begins darting in and out, only now it is not a nervous habit but a conscious act. JACOB's body feels the first waves of an inner tremor. His legs are shaking. \nJACOB What's going on? \nJEZZIE smiles at him. Her tongue wags and suddenly shoots from her mouth beyond human extension. JACOB recoils. \nJACOB (whispering to himself) This isn't happening. \nJEZZIE Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer. \nJEZZIE's head begins to tighten and squeeze, as though she is suffering from cramps. JACOB watches in horror as her skull gives birth to pointed horns. \nJACOB Oh God! \nJEZZIE What's wrong, Jake? (she mocks him) Forget to take your antidote? \nJACOB (screaming) Goddamn you! \nJEZZIE (smiling and then laughing) I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise. (she laughs with a hu- miliating tone) A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up. \nJACOB's eyes are locked on JEZZIE. His mouth is wide open. His body is shaking badly. He tries to back away from her but his legs barely move. \nJEZZIE There is nowhere to run, Jacob. You're home. \nSuddenly the pictures on the wall crash to the floor. Plaster from the ceiling breaks off in huge chunks and slams to the carpet. Light bulbs and lamps explode. JACOB runs to the door. He pulls it open and screams. He is on the edge of a fiery abyss. JEZZIE laughs with a new intensity of demonic force. JACOB spins around. \nJACOB WHO ARE YOU? \nJEZZIE How many times have you asked me that? How many times? \nJACOB TELL ME, DAMN YOU! \nJEZZIE (with consummate power) You know who I am. \nSuddenly JEZZIE reaches for her tongue and pulls at it with all her might. It is an act of total, unrelieved grotesqueness. With each yank the horror grows as JEZZIE literally pulls herself inside out before JACOB's eyes. \nThe emerging creature is JEZZIE transfigured, a demonic presence beyond anything we have seen before. It is black and covered with a thick oozing slime. Its head, still recognizable as JEZZIE, is rodent-like, with piercing green eyes and terrible horns protruding from its brow. Its powerful arms have long spiked claws. Its feet are cloven hooves. Extending from its back is a long, thick, muscular tail that whips around the room with devastating force. It throws furniture crashing through the air. \nA sudden cracking sound emerges from the DEMON's back. Dark forms penetrate the air. JACOB is breathless as huge wings unfold and spread out to the living room walls. The sound of their flapping is deafening. The walls shatter from their blows. As they crumble darkness appears on the other side. There are no other rooms. The VOID envelops them. The INFERNO emerges in all directions. The DEMON roars. \nDEMON (with JEZZIE's voice) Still love me, Jake? (it laughs and reaches out to him) COME! \nCUT TO JACOB's face. He has gone beyond fear. An intensity of rage is building in him that we have not witnessed before. His whole image seems transformed by it. He glows like a volcano before it erupts. \nSuddenly he explodes. The full fury of the Ladder detonates inside him. He yells at the DEMON with all his might. \n", "test1_input": "He hesitates. They all understand. \nROD What's that have to do with anything? \nFRANK It was bad grass. That's all it was. \nJERRY Grass never did that to me. \nDOUG You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing. \nROD It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over. \nJACOB ... I've seen them, too. \nROD Shit! \nJERRY So have I. \nJACOB Look, there's something fucking strange going on here. You know Paul's not the only one who's died. You remember Dr. Carlson over at Bellevue? His car blew up, too. \nROD Dr. Carlson's dead? \nJACOB An explosion, just like Paul's. \nJERRY No! \nFRANK Jesus! \nGEORGE You think they're connected? \nJACOB (he nods) I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy. \nROD Not me, buddy. \nJACOB Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on. \nDOUG Do you think it has something to do with ... the offensive? \nJACOB It's got something to do with some- thing. I think we've got to confront the army. If they're hiding shit from us, we better find out what it is. \nROD Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall. \nJACOB Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one. \nROD Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you. \nJACOB We should get ourselves a lawyer. \nROD I say you should get a shrink. \nDOUG Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game. \nJERRY Me, too. \nROD You guys are fucking paranoid. It was bad grass. That's all it was. There's no such thing as demons. \nINT.  LAW OFFICE - DAY \nJACOB, FRANK, JERRY, GEORGE, DOUG, and ROD are sitting on plush chairs in the LAW OFFICE of DONALD GEARY. GEARY, a red-faced man with three chins, is sucking on an ice cube. He looks at each of the men, and then spits the ice cube into an empty glass. It clinks. \nGEARY I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart. \nJACOB This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what. \nGEARY The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean? \nJACOB Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man. \nGEARY Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here? \nGEARY stands up and grabs a bag of Cheetos from a file drawer. He chomps down a few and offers the bag to the others. There are no takers. Thirsty, he downs the ice cube and cracks it between his teeth. \nGEARY (continuing) Okay. I'll look into it. \nThe MEN are surprised and excited. \nPAUL Wow! Do you think we have a chance? \nGEARY What do you want, a fortune teller or a lawyer? ... I'll need sworn depositions from each of you and a list of the other members of the platoon, or their survivors. \nDOUG Hey, this is great. \nGEARY I'll tell you, if we find the military is implicated in any way, you could stand to recover quite a lot of money. Not that I can predict anything, but some class action suits of this kind have been awarded fairly generous judgements. That wouldn't be so bad, would it Mr. Singer? \nJACOB Doctor. (GEARY looks at him oddly) Ph.D. \nGEARY Ah! I thought you were a mailman. \nJACOB I am. \n", "test1_true": "JACOB I'm too messed up to teach. \nGEARY (smiling) Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they? \nThe MEN all nod in agreement. \nEXT.  OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nJACOB and the others exit the OFFICE BUILDING. They are jubilant, clasping hands and smacking each other on the back. We watch as they break up. JACOB heads for the subway. FRANK and another group hop a cab. As the cab pulls away we notice that a black car pulls out behind it. It follows them out of sight. \nINT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nJACOB and JEZZIE are making wild and unadulterated love on the kitchen floor. The wastebasket flips over. JACOB's hand splashes into the dog's bowl. Nothing impedes their passion. JEZZIE laughs, hollers, and swoons. Hands grab hold of table legs. Chairs topple. Feet bang wildly against the stove. It is all mayhem and ecstacy. And then it ends. \nJACOB's face is ecstatic. He can barely talk and simply basks in JEZZIE's glow. She looks especially lovely and radiant. They lie exhausted and exhilarated on the linoleum floor. \nJEZZIE So tell me ... am I still an angel? \nJACOB (smiling broadly) With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away. \nJEZZIE kisses him softly around his face and gently probes his ear with her pinky. JACOB loves it. \nJEZZIE We're all angels, you know ... (she bites his earlobe. He winces) ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see. \nJACOB I love you, Jez. \nJEZZIE I know. \nJACOB Underneath all the bullshit, just love. \nJEZZIE Remember that. \nJACOB You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone. \nJEZZIE How come? The army? \nJACOB In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real. \nSilence. Suddenly JEZZIE roars like a monster and scares JACOB half to death. They laugh and tumble back to the floor. \nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - EVENING \nJACOB emerges from the bathroom shower and pulls on a robe. JEZZIE is moving rapidly around the KITCHEN. \nJEZZIE I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called. \nJACOB He did? When? \nJEZZIE (grabbing her coat) While you were in the shower. \nJACOB Why didn't you call me? \nJEZZIE He didn't give me a chance. (she pauses nervously) Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case. \nJACOB (stunned) What? What do you mean? \nJEZZIE He said you didn't have one. \nJACOB What's he talking about? \nJEZZIE I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said. \nJACOB I don't believe this. \nJEZZIE Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight. (she kisses him on the cheek) Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something. \nJACOB'S APT./FRANK'S APT. - INTERCUT \nThe door slams securely. The locks set. JACOB begins instantly rifling through a desk drawer. He comes up with a frayed address book and looks up a number. He dials. \nFRANK (V.O.) Hello. \nJACOB Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger. \nWe see FRANK standing at a window fingering the Venetian blinds. He does not reply. The scene intercuts between the two men. \nJACOB (continuing) Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about? \nFRANK (fingering the Venetian blinds) That's right. We did. \nJACOB What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why? \nFRANK It's hard to explain. \nJACOB (angry) Well, try, huh. \nFRANK I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen. \n", "test2_input": "JACOB yells. \nJACOB Louis! I'm here! In here! \nINT.  JACOB'S ROOM - DAY \nLOUIS storms through JACOB's door followed by several NURSES and ORDERLIES. \nJACOB LOUIS! \nNURSE 1 You can't go in there! \nORDERLY You're going to have to leave. \nLOUIS stares furiously at JACOB stretched out on the traction apparatus. He begins to yell. \nLOUIS Good God, Jake. What have they done? (he examines JACOB and screams at the NURSES) What is this, the Middle Ages? And they call this modern medicine. This is barbaric! Barbaric! (turning to JACOB) It's okay, Jake. It's not serious. I'll get you out of here. (yelling at the ORDERLY) What is this, the Inquisition? Why don't you just burn him at the stake and put him out of his misery? \nLOUIS charges over to the traction equipment and begins working the pulleys that suspend JACOB over the bed. The NURSES and ORDERLIES become instantly hysterical and start screaming. \nORDERLY What the hell do you think ... ? \nLOUIS Don't you come near me. \nNURSE 2 You can't do that! \nLOUIS What is this, a prison? Stay back. \nNURSE 1 You can't. Call the police. \nOne of the ORDERLIES lunges at LOUIS who swings back at him with one of the pulley chains. It just misses. \nLOUIS (to the ORDERLIES) You take one step and I'll wrap this around your neck. \nLOUIS lowers JACOB into a wheelchair while holding the others at bay. \nLOUIS (continuing) Hold on, Jake, we're getting out of here. \nNURSES and ORDERLIES part as he pushes him quickly from the room. \nOMIT \nINT.  CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - EVENING \nLOUIS helps JACOB over to an adjusting table in a room that, compared with the hospital, is comfortable and serene. He pushes a lever and the table rises to a vertical position. JACOB leans against it and rides it down to a horizontal position. Every moment is agony for him. \nLOUIS Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words. (JACOB barely hears them) Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you? \nJACOB (nearly whispering) Am I dead, Louis? (LOUIS leans over to hear) Am I dead? \nLOUIS (smiling) From a slipped disc? That'd be a first. \nJACOB I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis. \nLOUIS Well, I'll see what I can do about it. \nJACOB I've seen it. It's all pain. \nLOUIS (working on JACOB's spine like a master mechanic) You ever read Meister Eckart? (JACOB shakes his head \"no\") How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart? (LOUIS takes hold of JACOB's legs and yanks them swiftly) Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side. \nJACOB turns to his left. LOUIS shakes his head in dismay. \nLOUIS The other \"right,\" okay? (he helps JACOB turn over) You're a regular basket case, you know that? (he moves JACOB's arm over his head) Eckart saw Hell, too. \nLOUIS positions JACOB's other arm, bends his legs, and then pushes down on his thigh. His spine moves with a cracking sound. JACOB groans. \nLOUIS (continuing) You know what he said? The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of your life; your memories, your attachments. They burn 'em all away. But they're not punish- ing you, he said. They're freeing your soul. Okay, other side. \nHe helps JACOB and repositions him. Again he pushes and the spine cracks. \nLOUIS (continuing) Wonderful. So the way he sees it, if you're frightened of dying and hold- ing on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth. It's just a matter of how you look at it, that's all. So don't worry, okay? Relax. Wiggle your toes. \nJACOB's toes dance as LOUIS gives him a quick, unexpected jab to the lower vertebrae in his back. \nLOUIS (continuing) Perfect. We got it. (LOUIS pushes a lever and the table rises back up) Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand. \nJACOB What? By myself? \nLOUIS You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try. \nJACOB steps cautiously away from the table. He moves hesitantly, with deliberate restraint. LOUIS encourages him like a faith healer coaxing the lame. His first steps have an aura of the miraculous about them. JACOB walks slowly, without help. LOUIS smiles impishly. He looks like a giant cherub. \nLOUIS Hallelujah. \nLOUIS puts his arm around him. Then JACOB tries again, gradually rediscovering his balance and strength. With each step his confidence returns. LOUIS is pleased. Then, suddenly, without warning, JACOB turns and heads toward the door. \nLOUIS What are you doing? \nJACOB There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis. \n", "test2_true": "JACOB I'm walking, aren't I? \nLOUIS Jake, you need to rest. \nJACOB Not tonight, Louis. No more rest. \nHe walks slowly out the door. LOUIS starts to go after him. JACOB turns around and shakes his head \"no.\" The look on his face is firm and defiant. LOUIS stands back and lets him go. \nJACOB I love you, Louis. \nEXT.  U.S. ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT \nCUT TO A SDIREN BLARING and a fire engine racing through the streets of lower MANHATTAN. A CROWD is forming. Banks of lights and television cameras amass in the cold night air. Police cars and mobile units rush to the scene. \nCUT TO JACOB. In one hand he is holding a brightly lit torch. In the other he is holding a container of gasoline and pouring it on the steps of the U.S. ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS. The volatile liquid splashes against his pants and shoes and runs down the pavement. A five gallon container lies emptying nearby. Gasoline belches from it insistently and pours onto the street. Bystanders back away as the gasoline snakes toward them. \nTelevision cameras and microphones are pointing in JACOB's direction, but at a safe distance. He is yelling at them, his teeth chattering from the cold. \nJACOB Listen to me. There were four companies in our batallion. Five hundred men. Seven of us were left when it was over. Seven! Four companies engaged in an enemy offensive that not one of us who survived can remember fighting. \nBYSTANDERS Use the torch! \nONLOOKER Shut up! Let him talk! \nPOLICE AMBULANCES are arriving at the scene. FIREMEN ready hoses at nearby hydrants. T.V. CAMERAS are rolling. \nJACOB (shouting) You don't forget a battle where 500 men were killed. They did something to us. I want to know the truth, the goddamn truth. We have a right to know. (he yells toward the cameras) Are you getting all this? I want this on national T.V. I want the whole country, the whole world to know. \nHe holds up the torch. A loudspeaker blares through the crowd. \nVOICE Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest. \nJACOB For what? For seeking the truth? \nVOICE Please come quietly. \nJACOB You come near me and I'll blow us all up. \nVOICE We're not going to hurt you. \nONLOOKER Give him a chance to talk! \nJACOB The army will deny it. They've falsified my records. They've lied to my lawyer, threatened my buddies. But they can't threaten me. \nBYSTANDER You tell 'em! \nBYSTANDER Use the torch! \nVOICE Okay, let's clear the area. Everyone out. \nSuddenly a lighted match flies in JACOB's direction. JACOB is enraged. He brandishes the torch at the crowd. \nJACOB What the fuck do you think you're doing? \nAnother match hurls toward him and dies in mid-air. PEOPLE on the fringe of the crowd begin to run. JACOB does not move. \nVOICE Clear the area. This is an order! \nJACOB What is wrong with you? \nWe hear laughter from PEOPLE in the crowd. As JACOB looks out into some of their eyes he sees demons looking back. One of them throws another match. Crazed, JACOB runs toward them. PEOPLE jump back. \nSuddenly JACOB freezes. Standing on the sidelines, he sees one of the ARMY OFFICIALS who trapped him in the car. He is reaching for a gun. JACOB, stunned, yells at the top of hhis lungs. \nJACOB NO! \nWith a defiant roar, he hurls the torch straight up into the air. We see it from high above the crowd spinning higher and higher. All eyes stare upward watching it in a kind of wonder. Then, reaching its apex, just below the camera, it begins its descent. The eyes of the crowd turn to fear. SOMEONE yells. \nONLOOKER He'll burn us all! \nScreams fill the air as PEOPLE scramble to escape the potential conflagration. Only JACOB remains motionless, standing silently, almost heroically, in the middle of it all. \nSuddenly the torch hits the ground and a pool of gasoline ignites with a blinding flare that sends flames shooting in all directions. PEOPLE panic. T.V. REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN run for their lives. The ARMY OFFICIALS run, too. The flames travel toward the Army Headquarters and rush along the curb. Water hoses are trying to douse them as they spread. JACOB, surprisingly untouched by the fire, walks slowly through the frightened crowds, as if in a daze. Viewed through the flames the scene momentarily resembles a vision of Hell. \nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT \nJACOB, stark naked and covered with goose bumps, runs his hands under a shower spray. The water is freezing and taking forever to warm up. Anxious, he dashes past his gasoline drenched clothes, grabs a suitcase from the BEDROOM closet, and stuffs it with clothes. Then he hurries back to the shower, tests it, and jumps in. \nLather covers JACOB's hair and hangs over his tightly closed eyes. His entire body is covered in suds. He is washing as quickly as he can. Suddenly he hears a noise as someone enters the BATHROOM. He tenses. \nJACOB Who's there? Who is it? \nJACOB struggles to rinse the soap from his eyes. They are burning. There is a shadow behind the curtain. \nJACOB (continuing) Goddamn it! Who's there? \nJACOB rubs his eyes, fighting to see. Suddenly the shower curtain is thrown back. JACOB backs against the wall. A hand reaches in and pulls his nipple, pinching hard. \n", "test3_input": "MICHAEL (continuing) I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it. \nJACOB Never? \nMICHAEL I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue. \nJACOB What is it? \nMICHAEL Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on. \nJACOB (fearful) I don't know. \nMICHAEL \"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil,\" but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh? (JACOB smiles, his mouth open) Stick out your tongue. (JACOB obeys as an eyedropper deposits a drop of liquid on the back of his tongue) That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax. \nJACOB One drop? \nMICHAEL It's strong stuff. \nJACOB stretches out on the bed. He stares up at the ceiling and examines its pock-marked lunar look. Long cracks and shallow craters erode the surface. It is an alien terrain. \nJACOB I think I'm falling asleep. \nMICHAEL Pleasant dreams. \nThe words send a jolt through JACOB's body. He tries to get up but can't. He's frightened. \nJACOB I can't move. \nMICHAEL Just relax. \nJACOB What's happening? Help me. \nThe ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge crevasses tear through the plaster. JACOB's world is crumbling. He stares in horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the rupture above him. Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness. Hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through. \nJACOB (continuing) HELP ME! \nInstantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding the vial with the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds it over JACOB's mouth. \nMICHAEL Take it! \nJACOB fights him, but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the eyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit it out, but can't. \nSuddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break off and collide like continental plates. The collisons wreak havoc on the DEMONS, chopping and dismembering them. Body parts fall from the ceiling like a Devil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side. \nMICHAEL (continuing) Don't fight it. It's your own mind. It's your own fears. \nFlashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering like a war in the heavens. It is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe. It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes. JACOB's eyes stare into the formlessness expanding around him. All space is becoming a dark liquid void. \nGradually the liquid grows bluer, clearer. There is an undulating sense to the imagery, a feeling of womb-like comfort. Strange lights appear and sparkle before us like sunlight on the ocean. JACOB is rushing upward, toward the surface. \nWith the delirious sound of water giving way to air, JACOB breaks through. To his amazement, he finds himself floating out-stretched on shimmering sunlit water. Above him are clouds of such wondrous beauty that they cannot possibly be of the earth. Pillars of golden light reach down from the heavens creating a cathedral of light. It is a vision of heaven, a vast, almost mythic paradise. JACOB is awed. \nA sudden movement catches his attention. He looks over and sees MICHAEL standing before him. Only MICHAEL looks different. His face seems to radiate an inner light, a transcendental beauty. JACOB is nearly blinded by his presence and must shield his eyes to look at him. \nMICHAEL So, how you doin'? \nThe casualness of the words catches JACOB by surprise. He sits up. To his shock and amazement, he finds that he is back in THE HOTEL ROOM. MICHAEL is standing at the foot of the bed. JACOB is totally disoriented. His eyes move slowly around the room, taking everything in. He doesn't speak. \nMICHAEL (continuing) It was better than you expected, huh? \nJACOB just stares at him for a while and then suddenly begins to laugh. It is a huge laugh, full of energy and life. \nMICHAEL (continuing) And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone. \nJACOB I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle. \nMICHAEL Better living through chemistry, that's my motto. \nEXT.  GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY \nJACOB and MICHAEL are walking through the STREETS OF GREENWICH VILLAGE. It is early MORNING and the sidewalks are bustling with PEOPLE. JACOB stares into their faces and beams when they smile back. MICHAEL enjoys JACOB's happiness. \nEXT.  WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY \nJACOB and MICHAEL walk through WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK. \nJACOB It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there. \nMICHAEL Well that's good to know. \nJACOB Mike, it was real. It was glorious. \nMICHAEL Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back. \nJACOB I would have stayed there if I could. \nMICHAEL I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here. \nHe points to two POLICEMEN on the far side of the SQUARE. \n", "test3_true": "EXT.  GRAMERCY PARK HOTEL - DAY \nThe TWO MEN head up to GRAMERCY PARK and stop in front of the GRAMERCY PARK HOTEL. Reaching into his wallet, MICHAEL pulls out a huge stack of credit cards and hands one to JACOB. \nMICHAEL Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me. \nJACOB No. I couldn't. \nMICHAEL What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too. (he pulls out a business card) This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be. \nJACOB I don't know what to say. \nMICHAEL Save the words ... Just send back my credit card. \nMICHAEL laughs, hugs JACOB, and walks away. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nJACOB is in a lovely MOTEL ROOM overlooking GRAMERCY SQUARE. He is sprawled out happily on the bed when there is a knock at the door. He jumps up and opens it. JEZZIE is standing there. She looks at JACOB quizzically. He smiles and takes her in his arms, swinging her into the room. \nJEZZIE What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this? (JACOB smiles) Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do. \nJACOB I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do. \nJEZZIE Are you out of your mind? \nJACOB Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez. \nJEZZIE God, I can't keep up with all your changes. \nJACOB Me neither. \nJEZZIE What's gotten into you? \nJACOB grins. \nCUT TO JACOB and JEZZIE lying in bed gently caressing one another. For all his ardor JACOB is exhausted from the events of the preceding day. While stroking JEZZIE's hair he begins to fall asleep. JEZZIE crawls on top of him and shoves her hand down his pants. JACOB smiles. \nDISSOLVE TO JACOB and JEZZIE making love. \nTIME CUT: \nDISSOLVE TO JACOB and JEZZIE lying in front of the T.V. watching a romantic movie. JEZZIE snuggles up to JACOB. \nJEZZIE It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next. \nJACOB I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie. \nJEZZIE It's so hard to believe. \nThere is a knock at the door. JACOB throws on a bathrobe. JEZZIE jumps under the sheets. \nJACOB Who's there? \nBELLBOY (V.O.) It's your dinner, sir. \nJEZZIE's eyes brighten. JACOB opens the door. A BELLBOY wheels in a table set for dinner. He sets it in a corner of the room. JEZZIE jumps out of bed, runs to the table, sniffs at the food, and squeals excitedly. \nJEZZIE This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen. \nJACOB Stick with me, kid. \nJEZZIE smiles. \nTIME CUT: \nDISSOLVE to JACOB and JEZZIE sitting next to a large window overlooking GRAMERCY PARK. They are sipping champagne. \nJEZZIE I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go. \nJACOB It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone. \nJEZZIE I can waitress. I'm good. \nJACOB No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you. \nJEZZIE Bullshit! \nJACOB I promise. \nJEZZIE Please. \nJACOB No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable. \nJEZZIE Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry. \nJACOB I love you when you're angry. \n"}

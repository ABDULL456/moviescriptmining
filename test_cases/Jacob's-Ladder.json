CARMICHAEL Is he all right? \nJEZZIE He doesn't like it. \nMRS. CARMICHAEL I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice? \nJEZZIE Pour it in. \nMRS. CARMICHAEL On top of him? \nJEZZIE He's melting it as fast as we dump it in. \nMRS. CARMICHAEL Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy. \nTONY helps her pour the ice into the water. JACOB yells. \nJACOB Oh God! You're killing me! Stop! \nINT.  A BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO JACOB lying in a BEDROOM we have not seen before. He is tossing and turning in his bed as though struggling to get out. Suddenly he sits up and looks over at the window. It is open and the shade is flapping. Cold air is blowing in and he is shivering. \nJACOB Damn! You and your fresh air. \nHe jumps out of bed and goes over to the window. He pushes at the frame and it comes flying down with a loud bang. A woman in the bed sits up. It is SARAH. \nSARAH What was that? \nJACOB It's freezing. \nSARAH I'm not cold. \nJACOB Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed. \nSARAH It's not healthy with it closed. \nJACOB This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy. \nHe settles back into bed and pulls the covers back over to his side. He lies quietly for a moment, thinking. \nJACOB (continuing) What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was? \nSARAH I don't want to know. \nJACOB Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice. \nSARAH Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind? \nJACOB She was good in bed, though. \nSARAH Go to sleep. \nJACOB She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious. \nSARAH I thought you said it was a nightmare? \nSuddenly, out of nowhere, we hear the tinkling sound of a music box. A YOUNG BOY enters the room, carrying a musical LUNCH BOX in his arms. He is wearing a long T-shirt nearly down to his ankles. We recognize him from his photograph. It is GABE. \nGABE Daddy, what was that noise? \nJACOB (surprised to see him) Gabe? (he stares curiously at his son) What are you doing ... ? \nGABE There was a bang. \nJACOB It was the window. \nGABE It's cold. \nJACOB Tell your mother. \nGABE Mom, it's ... \nSARAH I heard you. Go back to sleep. \nGABE Will you tuck me in? \nSARAH (not happily) Oh ... all right. \nShe starts to rise. JACOB stops her and gets up instead. He whisks GABE upside down and carries him into his \n", "test1_true": "BEDROOM, licking his belly and tickling him all the way. GABE laughs and snuggles into his pillow as soon as he hits the bed. JED, 9, and ELI, 7, are both in bunk beds across the room. JED looks up. \nJED Dad? \nJACOB Jed. It's the middle of the night. (he kisses GABE and goes over to JED in the lower bunk) What's up? \nJED You forgot my allowance. \nJACOB Your allowance? It's five A.M. We'll talk at breakfast. \nJED Okay, but don't forget. \nSuddenly another voice pipes in from the top bunk. \nELI I love you, Dad. \nJACOB smiles. \nJACOB What is this, a convention? I love you, too, Pickles. Now go back to sleep. \nHe turns to leave. \nGABE Wait ... Daddy. \nJACOB Now what? \nGABE Don't go. \nJACOB Don't go? (he smiles) I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe. (he looks at his son tenderly) Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours. \nHe hugs him warmly and then walks to the door. \nGABE ... I love you. \nThere is deep emotion and seriousness in GABE's words. JACOB is struck by them. \nGABE (continuing) Don't shut the door. \nJACOB nods and leaves it a tiny bit ajar. \nGABE (continuing) A bit more ... a bit more. \nJACOB adjusts the opening enough to please GABE and make him secure. GABE smiles and cuddles in his bed. \nINT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJACOB settles back into bed. SARAH turns over and gets comfortable. JACOB lies on his back facing the ceiling. He pulls the blankets up to his neck. He is overcome with feelings of sadness and longing. \nJACOB I love you, Sarah. \nShe smiles warmly. His eyes close and in a matter of seconds he is back asleep. \nEXT.  VIETNAM - PRE DAWN \nWE HEAR SUMMER MORNING SOUNDS, CRICKETS and BIRDS. The image of trees materializes overhead and a beautiful pink sky, just before sunrise, can be seen through the branches. It is an idyllic setting. \nSuddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance, a metallic humming, growing louder. There is a scramble of feet and a sound of heavy boots moving through the tall grass. Voices can be heard. Men's voices. \nVOICE They're here. \nVOICE Thank God. Move 'em out! \nVOICES Bust your balls! \nVOICE Move it! Move it! \nThere is an instant swell of activity. Trees and branches blur and speed by overhead. The idyllic image of moments before reveals itself as a P.O.V. SHOT. The CAMERA races out of a JUNGLE covering and into a huge CLEARING. \nHigh overhead a helicopter appears. Its blades whirl with a deafening whine. Long lines drop from its belly and dangle in mid-air. SOLDIERS leap up into the air reaching for them. The air is filled with turbulence. Tarps fly off dead bodies. SOLDIERS hold them down. Voices yell but the words are not clear. They are filled with urgency. \nThe CAMERA leaves the ground. The edges of the sky disappear as the helicopter's gray mass fills the frame. It grows larger and darker as the CAMERA approaches. Rivets and insignias dotting the underbelly come into view. Suddenly the stretcher begins spinning, out of control. Hands emerge from inside, reaching out to grab it. \nWatery, womb-like sounds rise out of nowhere, the rippling of water, a heart beating. Gradually voices can be heard mumbling; distant sounds, warm and familiar. \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nJACOB's DOCTOR reaches down to help him out of the tub. Surprisingly JEZZIE and MRS. CARMICHAEL are standing there too. JACOB stares at them in total confusion. \nDOCTOR You are a lucky man, my friend. A lucky man. You must have friends in high places, that's all I can say. \nSAM and TONY appear next to the DOCTOR. They are extending their hands to the P.O.V. CAMERA. JACOB'S arms, nearly blue, reach out to them. \nSlowly they lift him from the icy water. JACOB takes one step onto the tile and collapses to the floor. \nCUT TO BLACK: \nINT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - DAY \n", "test1_id": 1641, "test2_input": "JACOB Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this. \nFRANK There's nothing to expose. \nJACOB Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you? (silence) What's going on? How can you just turn away? (no response) What about the others? \nFRANK They're not interested, Jake. \nJACOB Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know? \nFRANK (pausing) Maybe it's not the army, Jake. \nJACOB What do you mean? \nFRANK Maybe there's a larger truth. \nJACOB What are you talking about? \nFRANK Maybe the demons are real. \nJACOB Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that? \nFRANK Listen, Jake. I gotta go. \nJACOB What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ? \nFRANK I'm hanging up. \nJACOB Hey, wait! \nFRANK Don't bother to call again, okay? \nFRANK hangs up. JACOB stands holding the phone for a long time, until the high pitched whine from the receiver reminds him it's off the hook. The sound frightens him and he slams the receiver down. QUickly JACOB tears through his address book looking for other phone numbers. They aren't there. \nJACOB Shit! \nINT.  JACOB'S APT. \nJACOB hurries into the BEDROOM and pulls an old shoe box from the closet. The box is filled with yellowing army papers, dog tags, and photos of old comrades. Beneath his discharge papers he finds a sheet scribbled with the names and addresses of platoon buddies. JACOB grabs it. Then his eyes fall on the frayed remains of an old letter. He picks it up and unfolds it with great care. The letter is written in a child's handwriting. \"DEAR DADDY, I LOVE YOU. PLEASE COME HOME. JED GOT A FROG. ELI LOST MY KEY. MOM WANTS YOU TO SEND HER MONEY. LOVE, GABE.\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - DAY \nGABE, on a BICYCLE, is rushing down the sidewalk. JACOB is running alongside him, holding onto the seat. Plastic streamers trail from the handlebars. GABE is a bit wobbly, but determined. After a couple of false starts, JACOB lets go and GABE is riding by himself. For an instant, GABE looks back at his father with a huge grin on his face. JACOB is grinning, too. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON GABE as he pulls away from us and heads into the distance. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT \nJACOB swallows hard as he stands there, holding the letter. Suddenly his eyes lift off the page and glance at a full length mirror mounted on the bedroom door. Something in the mirror, like the image of a child, seems to move. He looks over. There is nothing there. Curious, JACOB walks toward the mirror. As his image appears, he gasps and stops moving. To his horror and ours, it is his own back that is reflected in the mirror. The impossibility of the moment startles him. He lifts his hand. The reflection moves with him. Frightened but defiant, JACOB moves toward the mirror. The image in the mirror spins around. It is the  FRIGHTENING VIBRATING FACE he saw at the party with JEZZIE. An unearthly scream comes from both their mouths. \nJACOB NO!!! \nINT.  BROOKLYN COURT HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA huge wooden door slams open. JACOB charges through it. \nHe is chasing his lawyer, DONALD GEARY, through a crowded court house corridor. GEARY, sweaty and unshaven, is cradling a Coke in one hand, a sandwich and a briefcase in the other. His stomach bounces wildly as he walks. \nJACOB Geary! Mr. Geary! Listen, goddamn it! You can't just walk away from this. \nGEARY keeps walking. JACOB catches up to him. \nJACOB (continuing) Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh? \nGEARY Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay? \nJACOB grabs the back of GEARY's jacket and pulls him up short. \nGEARY (continuing) Take your hands off me! \nJACOB lets go. He stares into GEARY's eyes. \nJACOB Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you. \nGEARY You need ... a doctor. \nJACOB A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something. \nGEARY gives JACOB a pitiful look. \nGEARY There's nothing I can do. \nHe turns and walks away. JACOB stands there a moment, and then rushes after him. GEARY is biting into his sandwich. \nMayonnaise spills onto his hand. He licks it with his tongue. JACOB catches up to him. \nGEARY You mind? I'm eating, huh? \n", "test2_true": "GEARY I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it. \nJACOB Used you? \nGEARY I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam. \nJACOB What the hell is that supposed to mean? \nGEARY It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand. \nJACOB (stunned) War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me. \nGEARY I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay? \nGEARY takes a swig of his COKE and begins walking away. JACOB, enraged, charges after him. With a wild swipe he sends the COKE CAN shooting out of GEARY's hand. It reverberates down the corridor. GEARY is stunned. \nJACOB You slimy bastard! You goddamn piece of shit! \nWith a powerful thrust, JACOB rips the sandwich from GEARY's other hand. Tossing it on the floor, he grinds his heel in it. Tomato and mayonnaise squirt onto GEARY's shoe. JACOB turns away. \nCUT TO JACOB walking down the COURT HOUSE CORRIDOR to the elevators. There is a look of satisfaction on his face. \nCUT BACK TO GEARY. He picks up a telephone and dials. Someone comes on the line. GEARY speaks quietly. \nGEARY He's on his way. \nCUT TO JACOB stepping onto the elevator. The doors close. The Muzak is playing \"Sonny Boy\" with Al Jolson singing. JACOB is surprised to hear it. He presses the down button for the main floor. \nThe elevator stops at the LOBBY. The doors open swiftly. SEVERAL SOLDIERS are standing there. They approach JACOB. \nSOLDIER 1 Let's go, Singer. \nJACOB is shocked to see them. He tries to get away but two of the SOLDIERS yank him toward the LOBBY doors. \nSOLDIER 2 You're coming with us. \nINT.  CAR - LATE AFTERNOON \nJACOB is hustled to a waiting car and shoved inside, in between two officious looking MEN. The doors lock from the DRIVER's command. \nARMY OFFICIAL #1 Mr. Singer. What an appropriate name for a man who can't keep his mouth shut. \nThe car drives off. \nJACOB Who are you? What do you want? \nARMY OFFICIAL #2 We've been watching you for a long time. You and your friends. You've been exhibiting some very odd behavior. Frightening people with foolish talk about demons - and experiments. \nJACOB tries to speak but the other MAN grabs his mouth. \nARMY OFFICIAL #1 You're in over your head, Mr. Singer. Men drown that way. The army was another part of your life. Forget it. It is dead and buried. Let it lie. \nARMY OFFICIAL #2 I hope we have made our point, Mr. Singer. \nJACOB stares at the men for a moment and then goes totally berserk. Letting out a howl, he begins pounding and thrashing like a madman. He is totally out of control. \nWith a wild leap, he grabs for the door handle. The door flies open. It flaps back and forth, slamming into parked cars. JACOB tries to jump out, but the men yank him back in. One of them pulls out a gun. JACOB sees it and goes crazy. His feet kick in all directions, slamming the DRIVER's nose into the steering wheel and shattering the side window. \nThe car careens around a corner sending the gun flying to the floor. The men dive for it. It lodges beneath the seat. In the mayhem, JACOB throws himself out of the flapping door and sprawls onto the pavement. People look down at him as the car speeds away. \nEXT.  BROOKLYN - LATE AFTERNOON \nJACOB grabs his back. He is in excruciating pain. He tries to get up, but can't move. He reaches out to people passing by, but they ignore him and hurry past. \nA SALVATION ARMY SANTA has been watching the entire scene. After a moment's consideration he leaves his post and ambles over to JACOB. He leans down and steals his wallet. \nSANTA Merry Christmas. \nEXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING \nCUT TO THE SOUND OF A SIREN as an AMBULANCE races through the streets. \nINT.  HOSPITAL - EVENING \nAN AMBULANCE CREW rushes JACOB to a HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. \nBEARER He's been screaming like a madman. You better get something in him. \nRESIDENT (approaching JACOB) Hi. I'm Doctor Stewart. Can you tell me what happened? \nJACOB My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor. \nRESIDENT Your back? Did you fall? \nBEARER They said he slipped on the ice. May have hit his head. \nATTENDANT Does he have any identification? \n", "test2_id": 1642, "test3_input": "JACOB pauses a moment and then turns to confront the terror behind him. \nJACOB WHO ARE YOU? \nJEZZIE How many times have you asked me that? How many times? \nJACOB TELL ME, DAMN YOU! \nJEZZIE (with consummate power) YOU KNOW WHO I AM. \nJEZZIE appears from the shadows. Her coat collar obscures her and it seems for a moment that she has no face. Then, to JACOB's horror, she turns around. He is staring at the vibrating creature he has seen so often before. Glimpsed almost in abstraction it is a living terror, dark and undefinable. Its face is a black and impenetrable void in constant vibration. Its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry, the essence of fear and suffering. JACOB pulls away from it, overhwelmed by confusion. He is rooted in fear. \nA sudden wind howls through the room, great gales blowing JACOB's hair straight up. It is like a hurricane pushing him into the wall. He can barely stand. He struggles to pull himself away. The flapping sound returns, charging at him from all directions. It is as if the darkness itself is swooping down, trying to envelop him. \nJACOB (whispering to himself) This isn't happening. \nNew terrible sounds arise, chain saws slashing through the air, knives, and sabers ripping through space with unrelenting anger. Guns fire and explode past his head. It is as though all the sounds of destruction are closing in on him. JACOB yells but his own voice is lost in the melee. Terrified, he looks heavenward, as if crying for help. \nSuddenly, from the noise, a calm voice rises, speaking, as if from a distance. It is LOUIS. JACOB is shocked to hear him. He stands motionless. \nLOUIS (V.O.) If you're frightened of dying you'll see devils tearing you apart. If you've made your peace then they're angels freeing you from the world. \nThe voice fades. JACOB just stands there, not sure what to do. And then the sounds return. Only now they are more terrifying than ever. Hideously loud, they become a cacophony of sounds, voices of parents, friends, lovers, the sounds of battle, fighting, and dying. \nJACOB looks up and sees the creature in the center of the room. All the sounds seem to emenate from it. The more JACOB stares at it the louder they become. After a moment, JACOB takes a huge breath. We sense a great resolve forming inside him. Then, slowly, courageously, he begins moving toward it. \nNEw and more terrifying noises assault JACOB, attempting to drive him back, but he will not be stopped. He continues walking toward the creature. \nIn the hallway a standing lamp slams sparking to the floor. It rolls back and forth like a living thing, with a maddening hypnotic regularity. Doors slam open and closed, unlatching, snapping, shutting, with deafening force. The room itself seems like an organic presence. It is alive, angry, and threatening. \nThe CREATURE sits in the midst of the insanity like the source of madness itself. It writhes, contorts and vibrates with unstoppable fury. JACOB, terrified, but unrelenting, continues to approach it. \nAS THE CAMERA DRAWS CLOSER TO THE CREATURE'S HEAD the density of its featureless form overwhelms the screen. It is like staring into emptiness itself, the ultimate darkness. \nWith superhuman effort JACOB grabs hold of the creature. It is like grabbing hold of a live wire. His body begins shaking uncontrollably like a man being electrocuted. He is flying in all directions but does not let go. His fingers claw at the creature's head. JACOB struggles defiantly with the monster. \nSuddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it. \nCREATURE WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FIGHTING! \nJACOB does not respond. It cries out again. \nCREATURE WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FIGHTING? \nDeep inside the darkness JACOB begins to make out the presence of a form, something writhing and tortured lurking before us. It looks briefly like an animal until we realize it is the image of a human face. It is covered by a dark suffocating film, like a mask. \nJACOB digs into it with all his might and pulls it off. \nCUT TO: \nDEAD SILENCE as JACOB SEES HIS OWN FACE staring back at him from beneath the mask. It is JACOB SINGER as we first saw him on the battlefield in Vietnam. Only now his image is pale and lifeless. It takes JACOB a moment to realize that he is dead. The recognition is one of terrible confusion and pain. JACOB stares at himself for a long time as a huge cry wells up inside him. It bursts forth with devastating sadness. \nAs that instant the whole of space seems to explode in a flash of catacylsmic power. Hundreds of images from JACOB's life flash before us, his birth, his childhood, his adulthood. The demons, the room, JEZZIE, LOUIS, MICHAEL, SARAH, all seem to assail us in a rush of blinding intensity. \nWe are flying over a landscape of memories, zooming across a constantly changing field of images. Some of the images move, some of the people in them speak. They are not particularly significant memories, in some ways they are quite banal, but something about them is infused with life and joy. Even the painful moments resonate with vital force. Some of the moments we recognize from the time we've spent with JACOB. Some we have not seen before. There is no order to them, no logic to why they have been recalled. \nA newborn baby takes its first breath and screams. SARAH pulls clothes off a clothes line on a rainy day. JACOB's FATHER stands in the Florida surf as sea foam laps gently at his legs. PAUL, FRANK, and JACOB play cards on the edge of a rice paddy. GABE rides his bike into the path of an oncoming car. A child puts his ear next to a bowl of cereal, listening to it talk. A young girl standing in a doorway lifts up her blouse to show her new breasts. JACOB and SARAH slice a wedding cake that topples to the floor. JEZZIE looks at JACOB and asks \"Love me a little?\" \nAnd then it is over. Total silence overwhelms the screen, a wonderful soothing calm. JACOB's eyes open and he is shocked to find himself sitting on the floor in SARAH's apartment. He is all alone. The first rays of early morning sunlight are filtering through the window. Something about the apartment seems transfigured, magical. JACOB sits motionless, stunned to be back there. \nThe faint sound of music can be heard coming from the hallway. It is warm and familiar, the tinkling of a music box. JACOB listens to it for a few moments and then something registers inside him. Curious, he gets up and approaches the corridor. \nJACOB Hello? \nThere is no response. Suddenly the music stops. JACOB freezes for a moment. He sees someone standing in the shadows at the other end. \nJACOB (continuing) Who is it? Who's there? \nTentatively JACOB moves forward. As he draws closer he begins to see the outline of a child. Then, all of a sudden, he realizes who it is. His eyes well up as he stands there, the full impact of the moment registering inside him. It's his son, GABE. He is carrying the same musical lunch box we have seen before. The young boy smiles warmly at his father. It is the smile of an angel. JACOB swallows hard. \nJACOB (continuing) Gabe? Gabe! \nJACOB runs to his son. Unable to hold back the tears, he embraces him in a rush of love and emotion. \nJACOB (continuing) Gabe. Oh God. I don't believe ... \nThey hug one another over and over. JACOB, overcome, sits down on the stiars. After a moment GABE puts his arm around his father's shoulder in a gesture of surprising maturity and compassion. We sense for an instant that their roles have reversed. GABE reaches for JACOB's hand and gently encourages him to stand up. \nWith a sweet tug GABE leads his father up the steps. \nSunlight streams down from the top of the stiars, hitting the first landing. GABE is bathed in its warm glow. As JACOB reaches the landing, he too is surrounded by the comforting light. \nGABE hurries up the last set of stairs. JACOB turns to follow but is stunned by the brilliance of the light pouring in from above. Squinting, he cannot see his son. Then suddenly GABE steps back out of the light and takes his father's hand once more. His eyes sparkle with excitement. \nGABE Come on Dad ... You know what we've got? A sandbox just like the Williston's, only it's bigger and the sand's all white. You won't believe it. \nJACOB smiles at his son. GABE smiles at him. It is a moment of total euphoria. THE CAMERA HOLDS as they continue up the stairs. \nGABE (continuing) And my parakeet. Remember, the one grandma let out of the cage? He's okay. And he's talking now. He knows my name. \n", "test3_true": "Suddenly the brightness condenses into a smaller light source. It holds for a second and then flashes off. An overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in view. \nINT.  VIETNAM FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY \nA DOCTOR leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his mask. His expression is somber. He shakes his head. His words are simple and final. \nDOCTOR He's gone. \nCUT TO JACOB SINGER lying on an operating table in a large ARMY FIELD TENT in VIETNAM. The DOCTOR steps away. A NURSE rudely pulls a green sheet over his head. The DOCTOR turns to one of the aides and throws up his hands in defeat. \nAN ORDERLY wheels JACOB's body past rows of other DOCTORS and NURSES fighting to save lives. A YOUNG VIETNAMESE BOY pulls back a screen door to let them out of the tent. It is a bright, fresh morning. The sun is rising. \nTHE END \n\"JACOB'S LADDER\" (DELETED SCENES) \nby \nBruce Joel Rubin \nADDENDUM 1:  PROFESSOR STERN \nINT.  CITY COLLEGE LECTURE HALL - DAY \nCUT TO a huge ampitheatre-style LECTURE HALL at CITY COLLEGE. It is almost empty. No more than FORTY STUDENTS are scattered near the front of nearly three hundred seats. All are listening to PROFESSOR EMANUEL STERN who is nearing the end of his lecture. \nSTERN Thus at the core of today's discu- sion we find four fundamental doc- trines. First, that the world of matter and individual consciousness are both manifestations of one Divine Reality. \nOne of the STUDENTS seems about to fall asleep and keeps nodding his head. \nSTERN Even you, Mr. Palmer, are part of it, as amazing as that may seem. \nMR. PALMER sits up quickly in his seat as other STUDENTS smile. \nSTERN Second, human beings are capable not only of kowledge about this Divine Re- ality by inference but can realize its existence by direct intuition, superior even to reason. \nA door opens in the upper reaches of the lecture hall. JACOB enters and walks quietly down the stairs to within hearing range of the professor. \nSTERN Third, man possesses a double nature, an ego and an eternal self, what we call \"spirit\" or \"soul.\" \nJACOB takes a seat at one of the desks. There is a pencil lying on it which he fingers distractedly. \nSTERN Fourth, and most important, man's life on earth has only one end and purpose, to learn to let go of the separate ego and to identify with the Divine spark within. \nMR. PALMER is nodding off again. \nSTERN Almost impossible to believe, isn't it Mr. Palmer, that somewhere in that unconscious head of yours lies the source of all consciousness? \nPALMER Yes, Sir. Very hard. \nSTERN (nodding his head) Well now, having reached this apotheosis there seems little, if anything, left to say. So rather than try, you are dismissed. \nThe STUDENTS seem surprised but not unhappy with the sudden dismissal. They quickly gather their books and begin the long climb to the exits. Only JACOB remains seated. \nJACOB Hello Prof. \nPROFESSOR STERN looks up and stares at KACOB for several seconds before recognizing him. \nSTERN My oh my. Doctor Singer. Isn't this a happy surprise? \nJACOB comes down the aisle and clasps hands with his old PROFESSOR. \nSTERN (looking at JACOB's uni- form) Are you in the service? \nJACOB The postal service. I'm a mailman. \nSTERN (surprised but non- judgemental) Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that. \nJACOB (smiling) It's good to see you. \nSTERN Likewise. \nEXT.  CITY COLLEGE - DAY \nJACOB AND PROFESSOR STERN walk down the city streets that constitute the CAMPUS of CITY COLLEGE. \nSTERN And how is your wife? Sarah, no? \nJACOB (shrugging his shoul- ders) I haven't seen her in months. \nSTERN (understanding) Ah! \nJACOB I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch. \nSTERN Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office? \nJACOB Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all. \n", "test3_id": 1643}

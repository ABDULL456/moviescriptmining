She leaves -- he quickly puts on his coat and follows her.

INT. THE ELEVATOR GOING DOWN - NIGHT 
ALEX Christ, I don't want to go to this stupid party. I'm bad at false modesty. 
CLAIRE You're great at it. 
She straightens his half-tied tie in an act of familiar affection rather than motherliness. Nervousness. She speaks calmly -- this is ground they have already covered. 
CLAIRE Alex, you're going to make a great anchorman in New York and undoubtedly I could be a Pulitzer Prize winning hostess -- but I'm not going with you. 
ALEX You can work out of the East Coast. We'll get a place on Long Island and burn our suitcases. 
CLAIRE I still like suitcases. 
ALEX Every Saturday night we'll have a party... invite all our friends, sit out on the veranda and interview each other. 
CLAIRE I've done all that. 
ALEX I haven't. (beat; changes tack) Well, God dammit, I'm getting tired of memorizing who's the president of the... Republic of Maldives. 
CLAIRE Mamoon Abdul Gayoom. 
ALEX Yeah, he succeeded Mamoon Abdul Gayeem. 
They both smile slightly as the elevator comes to a stop. The door doesn't open, and the light flickers. 
ALEX And I'm tired of Third World elevators. 
He bangs the door with his fist. It opens, and they enter a dismal hallway. The sounds of a party come from beyond. 
ALEX Don't leave me. 
CLAIRE I already have. 
As they approach the door to the party, he speaks with new toughness. 
ALEX Fuck Abou Deia and New York. I'm going to Nicaragua with you. 
CLAIRE No. 
ALEX I've heard it's a neat little war with a nice hotel. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE ROOM WITH THE PARTY - NIGHT 
A cheer goes up for Alex as he and Claire enter. Party hats, booze, hand-made signs reading "Bon Voyage," etc. Fifteen journalists of varying nationalities cover this backwater war. 
Though both upset, they act as if everything is normal. 
PRICE STANDS ON A CHAIR AT THE CENTER summoning Alex who moves through the group with ease, instantly at home. Price holds up a bottle of champagne in toast. 
PRICE Alex, get up here! 
Alex climbs on a chair next to Price who puts his arm around him. 
PRICE To the man who gave me my first job, and fired me from my first job... and gave me my second job... 
VOICE FROM CROWD And fired you from your second job... 
PRICE Just a few words, Alex. 
VOICES FROM CROWD Impossible! Can't be done! etc. 
However miserable, Alex shines in these situations. He raises his hand -- silence. 
ALEX You may be asking yourself what exactly are you doing here in this "strange war, just another chapter in an endless story... that grinds into its seventh year..." 
Claire slips to the side bar and pours herself a drink, watching Alex and shaking her head with some affection. 
JIMMY, THE CAB DRIVER, ENTERS WITH A CAKE covered with candles. The crowd parts for the cake shaped like the country of Chad. The crowd begins singing "Caravan" in a half-drunken tribute to a man they like and respect. 
PRICE MOVES AROUND THE ROOM TAKING PICTURES of the party; it is all casual, silly, fun. 
THROUGH CAMERA P.O.V.'S OF ALEX IN A PARTY HAT, whip pan to CABBY WITH THE CAKE, whip pan to DRUNKEN JOURNALISTS. 
THROUGH CAMERA P.O.V. OF CLAIRE -- FREEZE FRAME, pan follows her as she moves through the room -- FREEZE FRAME, she picks up another drink and leaves through a side door -- FREEZE FRAME. 
ALEX GIVES IN AND JOINS THE SINGING, enjoying his own tribute once he has managed to give in to it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE DARKROOM - RED LIGHTS 
Claire's face is also covered with tears as she smokes, wandering idly among clothespinned photos. A part of her life is ending -- life with Alex -- but it's not ending neatly.

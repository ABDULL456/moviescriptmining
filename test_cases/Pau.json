{"test1_input": "Caption: 50 MINUTES LATER They are sat in exactly the same position as before. CLIVE looks a little downbeat, GRAHAM fidgets with his pens. \nPUBLICIST Okay, that's the hour. How'd we do? \nCLIVE Three copies. \nPUBLICIST Hey, one for each tit. Maybe you should have given her four. \nGRAHAM That's sick. \nPUBLICIST Don't sweat it. It's a sleeper. \nCLIVE Yeah, but three copies? \nPUBLICIST Better than Carl Weathers. \nCLIVE \nYES! \nGRAHAM Would you like a copy? \nPUBLICIST Are you nuts? My office is full of junk. The PUBLICIST walks away chuckling. \nCLIVE Graham, I need a drink. \nINT. HOTEL. BAR - NIGHT \nGRAHAM and CLIVE are stood against the wall in a bar. GRAHAM drinks and elaborate blue cocktail through a straw. CLIVE sips from a Jack Daniels and Coke. Everyone else in the bar is dressed as a HOBBIT. CLIVE winks at a girl. \nINT. HOTEL. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGRAHAM and CLIVE's hotel room is filled with bags of stuff from the convention, a laptop computer and a games console plugged into the TV. GRAHAM lies on his bed. He is looking at a map. Other maps are scattered about. \nCLIVE (O.S.) It was like the Prancing Pony in there. \nGRAHAM Nasty Hobbitses. CLIVE emerges from the bathroom. He is naked but for a black towel wrapped around his waist. His hair is wet and suddenly incredibly long. Around his neck, a large animal tooth hangs on a black leather cord. \nCLIVE They think they're so cool. \nGRAHAM Hey, are you excited about going to Area 51? \nCLIVE Hell yes. \nGRAHAM 06.30 check out? \nCLIVE A-ffirmative. GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches. \nCLIVE Three, two, one... \nGRAHAM CLIVE Beep. Beep. \nCLIVE Good night, Graham. \nGRAHAM Good night, Clive. They switch off their respective bedside lights. The room is plunged into pitch darkness. A few seconds pass. \nGRAHAM Are you asleep? \nCLIVE No. \nGRAHAM Shall we try and storm the Citadel before we nod off? \nCLIVE Couldn't hurt could it? We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV. The boys lie on their beds holding games controllers. \nCLIVE Cover me. \nINT. HOTEL. RECEPTION - MORNING \nGRAHAM and CLIVE stand at reception. Both look extremely sleepy. CLIVE's eyes close. GRAHAM lolls forward onto the reception desk. His head hits the bell. \nDING! \nEXT. HOTEL - MORNING \nThe boys stand, waiting for their transport. We see them from across the road. A tiny old car splutters up to the curb. A valet gets out and hands the keys to CLIVE. \nVALET There you go. \nGRAHAM That's not ours. \nVALET No? \nCLIVE No, that's ours. A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of the range in its day. Still looks good. \n", "test1_true": "VALET Fucking Borg. (giving the finger) Assimilate this! The RV speeds past the disgruntled VALET. GRAHAM and CLIVE can be heard whooping within. \nINT. RV - MORNING \nCLIVE is seated behind the wheel of their RV, he now wears black wrap-around shades. In the back of the RV, GRAHAM fusses with maps and provisions. \nGRAHAM Breakfast? \nCLIVE Java. Straight up. \nGRAHAM Any solids? \nCLIVE No, let's punch through. Miles make the eggs taste sweeter. \nGRAHAM I love eggs! \nCLIVE I hear that. Now, get that \"\u0098Joe' on the go and jump in the Chewie seat. I need your map skills. \nGRAHAM Good job I pre-pared. GRAHAM flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co-pilot's (Chewie) seat. \nGRAHAM It's a shame I don't have some controls on this side. That way, I could take over if you needed the loo. \nCLIVE Yeah, I could say \"take the helm.\"\u009d \nGRAHAM \"Take the helm, number one.\"\u009d \nCLIVE Yeah, \"take the helm, number one, I need a number two.\"\u009d They laugh heartily. Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out his laptop and setting it up on the dash board. \nGRAHAM \"\u0098Least I've got Cerebro, eh? \nCLIVE Absolutely. Real-time sat-nav multi map and advanced geo-tagging with continual info stream? \nGRAHAM Impressive. \nCLIVE Most impressive. \nGRAHAM And let's not forget, we've always got Analogue. GRAHAM pulls a map down. Obscuring the entire windshield. \nCLIVE Not when we're driving Graham. \nGRAHAM Sorry. GRAHAM sends the map back up into the roller. The coffee percolator gurgles in the galley. \nGRAHAM Sounds like coffee o'clock. \nCLIVE Thank god. I'm a wreck until I've had my first cup of J. GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen. \nINT. DINER - DAY \nGRAHAM and CLIVE eat lunch. GRAHAM has finished a plate of prawns. He inspects the shells. \nGRAHAM Looks like a pile of dead droids. A perky waitress approaches. GRAHAM and CLIVE become shy and awkward. \nWAITRESS You boys all set? Can I get you anything else? GRAHAM spills his drink. CLIVE appears very uneasy. \nINT/EXT. RV - DAY \nThey drive in silence, surveying the landscape. \nCLIVE Amazing, isn't it? There are 295,734,134 people in this country and we haven't seen a soul for a hundred miles. Where is everybody? \nGRAHAM What about that old woman on crutches we saw hitchhiking? \nCLIVE Apart from her. I suppose that's why they established the Dreamland facility out here. \nGRAHAM Far from prying eyes. \nCLIVE Did you know the site was selected in the mid-1950s for testing of the U-2 spyplane, due to its remoteness, proximity to existing facilities and presence of a dry lake bad for landings? \nGRAHAM Yes. \nCLIVE Oh. \nGRAHAM Shall we have a bite before or after we hit the Black Mailbox? \nCLIVE Before. \nINT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING \nGRAHAM and CLIVE tuck into burgers. They are the only customers. The interior is replete with various Area 51 related memorabilia. PAT, (female, 50s) the proprietor, speaks to them from behind the counter. She holds up two bumper stickers. \nPAT \"Watch The Skies\"\u009d or \"Alien Onboard?\"\u009d GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other for a few seconds before looking back at PAT. \n", "test1_id": 204, "test2_input": "GRAHAM/CLIVE \"Alien Onboard.\"\u009d \nPAT Nice choice. So, where have you boys come from? \nGRAHAM \n(MUMBLY) San Diego. \nPAT Comic-Con? \nCLIVE How could you tell? We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever. \nPAT Just a guess. My nephew launched a comic down there a couple of years ago. Sort of dramatized the accounts of some of the folk we've had in here. \nCLIVE Encounter Briefs? \nPAT That's it. You heard of it, huh? \nCLIVE I've got all six. \nPAT Well whaddya know? Small world. \nCLIVE Do you get a lot of UFO types round here? We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face. \nPAT Some. \nGRAHAM Have you ever seen one? \nPAT A UFO? Oh, I've seen plenty. \nGRAHAM Really?! You've seen more than one UFOs? \nPAT Well, I don't know what they were. So as far as I'm concerned they're unidentified and they were definitely flying. \nCLIVE And objects. \nPAT Damn straight. Whether or not they were spaceships, I can't say. Probably not, but I'd like to think they were. Be a shame if we were the only souls in the universe. \nCLIVE Did you now, it's estimated that there are as many as 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe and each of those has approximately 40 billion starts, around which orbit countless planets and moons? \nPAT Yes. \nCLIVE Oh. \nPAT Makes you think though, don't it? \nCLIVE What? \nPAT Where is everybody? GRAHAM and CLIVE ponder this. \nPAT You boys all set? \nCLIVE I'd like a cup of coffee please. \nPAT Sure thing. How about you, sugar? \nGRAHAM Can I have an E.T. malt please? \nPAT You wanna sparkler in that? GRAHAM smiles coyly. \nPAT I'll take that as a yes. She beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen. GRAHAM and CLIVE are left alone. They take it all in. \nCLIVE It's nice here, isn't it? \nGRAHAM Absolutely. \nCLIVE I think I might use the loo. CLIVE walks through a door marked \"\u0098Maliens'. The adjacent toilet door (GUS and JAKE) enter. GRAHAM becomes uneasy. \nPAT Yes dear, what can I get you? \nJAKE Two beers. \nPAT Coming right up. \nINT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. TOILET - EVENING \nCLIVE washes his hands. He pumps soap from a dispenser which is shaped like an alien's head, the soap squirts out of its mouth. CLIVE is quite taken with this. \nCLIVE That is absolutely amazing! \nINT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING \nCLIVE appears out of the toilet with his hands in the air. \n", "test2_true": "CLIVE I'm joking, of course. They have a soap dispenser, shaped like an alien's head. When you pump his jaw, soap comes out of his mouth. \nGRAHAM \n(MUMBLING) Clive... \nCLIVE It's hilarious. GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter. \nCLIVE What? CLIVE looks over and sees the two men. They are glaring back. CLIVE immediately loses his confident air. \nPAT (O.S.) Here it comes! GRAHAM closes his yes, remembering what he ordered. The two men turn to see PAT emerge from the kitchen with a tray of drinks. Two bottles of beer, one cup of coffee and an absurd looking milkshake in a tall glass with a sparkler. \nPAT Okay then, beers for you gentleman. A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt with a sparkler for the boys from outer space. The man snigger derisively. PAT senses the tension. \nPAT So, where you boys headed? \nJAKE We're heading into Utah. Do ourselves some hunting. \nGUS Deer, coon, beaver, whatever steps in front of the bangstick, right Jake? They throw a look back at GRAHAM and CLIVE. \nJAKE You got that right, Gus. \nPAT Well now, I heard Utah beaver puts up quite a fight. \nGUS That's what we're counting on. They nudge each other and laugh. \nPAT I better make you something good and hot. Long way to The Beehive. PAT give GRAHAM and CLIVE a look. CLIVE understands and fumbles for hi wallet. \nHe places a number of bills on the table. They leave. GRAHAM comes back in and retrieves the bumper sticker. PAT gives him a wink. He leaves. \nINT/EXT. RV - EVENING \nGRAHAM boards the RV. CLIVE is in the driver's seat. The engine is running. \nCLIVE What took you so long? \nGRAHAM I was putting the sticker on. \nCLIVE They were an odd pair, weren't they? \nGRAHAM Definitely didn't speak Bocci. CLIVE fires up the engine and jams it into reverse. CRUNCH. \nGRAHAM (CONT'D) That wasn't their truck was it? \nCLIVE No. \nEXT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN - EVENING \nThe RV roars off, leaving the car park and the black Lincoln Escalade, shiny, mean, dented. \nINT/EXT. RV - NIGHT \nGRAHAM looks at a map. CLIVE drives, continually checking his rear view. \nGRAHAM What's the matter? \nCLIVE Nothing. How we doing? \nGRAHAM We should be just about there. They scan the roadside for a few seconds. \nCLIVE I've found it. \nGRAHAM Where? \nCLIVE \nTHERE!!! \nEXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe RV comes to a screeching halt. It sits in the road for a moment, before it trundles onto the hard shoulder. The door opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE appear wearing head mounted torches. They wander over to a WHITE mailbox. \nGRAHAM/CLIVE \n(REVERENTIALLY) The Black Mailbox. GRAHAM and CLIVE marvel at it. The silence of the night and the size of the landscape dawns on them. They look up. \nCLIVE It's amazing, isn't it? We're actually here. \nGRAHAM Area 51. \nCLIVE Dreamland. \n", "test2_id": 205, "test3_input": "The sun has just risen. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL lie round the smoldering camp fire sleeping soundly. PAUL is very white. His eyes open. He looks around. \nPAUL Oh shit! Hey, wake up. Wake up. We fell asleep. \nCLIVE How did that happen? \nPAUL Sorry, I get this thing when I get high. It's called \"\u0098projective empathy'. You feel what I feel. \nGRAHAM Like in E.T.? \nPAUL Exactly. \nCLIVE Oh, thank God. For a second there I thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer. The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood. Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet town of last night has become very busy indeed. \nGRAHAM Oh dear! \nPAUL I can't walk through there. \nCLIVE How are we going to get back? Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life. \nEXT. TOWN - DAY \nGRAHAM and CLIVE walk down the busy main street, between them is PAUL. He is dressed in the little cowboy suit from the shop window, his hat pulled down low over his face. \nGRAHAM Maybe we should hold hands, so that we look like a family. \nPAUL That's great! Two grown men who look like sex offenders holding hands with a child cowboy. \nCLIVE You could be a midget. \nPAUL You're obsessed with midgets! They continue on, trying to look as if nothing is strange. \nGRAHAM Seem to be working, Clive. Clive? GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them. He looks back to see CLIVE, gawping thought the window of a COMIC SHOP, at a sword resembling the one they saw at Comic-Con. The tag reads \"\u0098Genuine \"\u0098BLADE' Katana'. $299.99. \nGRAHAM Clive, no. CLIVE walks into the shop. GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly behind. As they enter the COMIC SHOP, MOSES BEHE emerges from the adjacent Drug Store. He takes a couple of pain killers and flexes his sore shoulders. He wanders up the road, scanning the passers by. \nINT. COMIC SHOP - DAY \nGRAHAM approaches CLIVE who is at the counter. \nGRAHAM Now's not really the time, Sausage. \nCLIVE I must have it. \nGRAHAM It's very cheap. Are you sure you don't want to save up and get a proper on? \nCLIVE Oh, come on, we've got time. \nINT/EXT. RV - DAY \nClose on RUTH's watch. She paces, worried. \nKNOCK KNOCK. \nRUTH Where have you been? I was worried. She opens the door. AGENT ZOIL flashes his badge. \nZOIL Good morning, Ma'am. Sorry to trouble you. Agent Zoil, Secret Service. Your wagon here matches the description of a recreational vehicle we're currently looking for. May I ask, are you alone? RUTH pauses a second. \nRUTH Yes, I'm alone. \nZOIL Do you mind taking a look at these pictures? ZOIL pulls out three pictures and hands them to RUTH. CCTV shots of GRAHAM and CLIVE at the gas station and MOSES's pic of RUTH, looking younger, with dark hair and no glasses. \nZOIL Do you recognise any of these people, Miss? She lingers on the picture of herself. \nZOIL Miss? \nRUTH No, sorry I don't. \nZOIL Where are you coming from, Ma'am? \nRUTH Christian ministry in Seattle. I've been driving for 5 days. \nZOIL Going far? \nRUTH Austin. \nZOIL Great town. \nRUTH Oh yes. It has an impressive bat population you know? \n(MORE) \nRUTH (CONT'D) Folks gather by the rive in the evening to watch them fly out. Turn the sky black. Quite a sight. \n", "test3_true": "RUTH Uh-huh. Well, I really should be getting along. \nZOIL Of course. Thanks for your time, Miss...? Beat. \nRUTH Darwin, Charlotte Darwin. ZOIL smiles and nods. He laves. \nINT. COMIC SHOP - MOMENTS LATER \nGRAHAM and CLIVE are at the counter. CLIVE is trying out the blade. PAUL, in cowboy guise browses the racks of comics. He picks one up. The cover features an alien that looks a lot like him. The comic is called \"\u0098Encounter Briefs: Tales From the Dreamland'. PAUL smiles and shakes his head. He suddenly realises he is being watched. Next to him is a child, (8) small enough to see under PAUL's hat. He is looking at the cover of the comic and back at PAUL. \nPAUL How's it going? \nCHILD Is that you? \nPAUL No. \nCHILD It looks like you. \nPAUL Suppose it does. What's your name? \nCHILD Keith Nash. \nPAUL I'm Paul. Pleased to meet you. They shake hands. \nPAUL You on your own here, Keith Nash? \nKEITH NASH My Mom's shopping for some new jeans. She lets me wait in here. \nPAUL Sounds like a good Mum. \nKEITH NASH Yes and no. What're you doing here? \nPAUL My friend's buying a sword. He's a grown man. \nKEITH NASH What a nerd. PAUL laughs. So does KEITH NASH. \nPAUL You an M&Ms man, Keith? PAUL produces his M&Ms. He offers one to KEITH. \nKEITH NASH I am but I shouldn't. \nPAUL Strangers with candy, right? \nKEITH NASH Right. \nPAUL Well, we've got a lot in common. We both like comics and M&Ms. Guess that makes us pals. \nKEITH NASH Guess so. KEITH beams at PAUL and takes a few M&Ms. They turn their attention back to the racks of comics. PAUL pulls one out called \"\u0098G-Men'. On the cover it shows an agent, not unlike ZOIL, shooting an alien not unlike PAUL. \nPAUL You read this one? \nKEITH NASH No. \nPAUL It's a good one. Take it. Go on. It's a gift. \nKEITH NASH Thanks Paul. \nKEITH stuffs it down his trousers. PAUL laughs. We hear MRS. NASH calling from the street. \nKEITH NASH I gotta go. \nPAUL Catch you later, Keith Nash. GRAHAM and CLIVE approach. CLIVE has a long sword shaped box under his arm and a big grin on his face. \nCLIVE Who was that? \nPAUL Keith Nash. How much was that? \nCLIVE $299.99. It's made of a low grade Turkish alloy. \nPAUL What did you get, speccy? \nGRAHAM X-Men action figure. \nPAUL Jesus Cheeeerist. \nEXT. COMIC SHOP - DAY \nGRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL exit the comic shop. PAUL waves to KEITH NASH, who now sits outside, on a bench, with his MOTHER. The boys walk up the street, seconds later, HAGGARD and O'REILLY step out of a store, eating bags of candy. \nMRS. NASH Don't lie, Keith. \nKEITH NASH I'm not lying. \n", "test3_id": 206}

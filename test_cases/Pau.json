{"train": "Caption: 50 MINUTES LATER They are sat in exactly the same position as before. CLIVE looks a little downbeat, GRAHAM fidgets with his pens. \nPUBLICIST Okay, that's the hour. How'd we do? \nCLIVE Three copies. \nPUBLICIST Hey, one for each tit. Maybe you should have given her four. \nGRAHAM That's sick. \nPUBLICIST Don't sweat it. It's a sleeper. \nCLIVE Yeah, but three copies? \nPUBLICIST Better than Carl Weathers. \nCLIVE \nYES! \nGRAHAM Would you like a copy? \nPUBLICIST Are you nuts? My office is full of junk. The PUBLICIST walks away chuckling. \nCLIVE Graham, I need a drink. \nINT. HOTEL. BAR - NIGHT \nGRAHAM and CLIVE are stood against the wall in a bar. GRAHAM drinks and elaborate blue cocktail through a straw. CLIVE sips from a Jack Daniels and Coke. Everyone else in the bar is dressed as a HOBBIT. CLIVE winks at a girl. \nINT. HOTEL. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGRAHAM and CLIVE's hotel room is filled with bags of stuff from the convention, a laptop computer and a games console plugged into the TV. GRAHAM lies on his bed. He is looking at a map. Other maps are scattered about. \nCLIVE (O.S.) It was like the Prancing Pony in there. \nGRAHAM Nasty Hobbitses. CLIVE emerges from the bathroom. He is naked but for a black towel wrapped around his waist. His hair is wet and suddenly incredibly long. Around his neck, a large animal tooth hangs on a black leather cord. \nCLIVE They think they're so cool. \nGRAHAM Hey, are you excited about going to Area 51? \nCLIVE Hell yes. \nGRAHAM 06.30 check out? \nCLIVE A-ffirmative. GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches. \nCLIVE Three, two, one... \nGRAHAM CLIVE Beep. Beep. \nCLIVE Good night, Graham. \nGRAHAM Good night, Clive. They switch off their respective bedside lights. The room is plunged into pitch darkness. A few seconds pass. \nGRAHAM Are you asleep? \nCLIVE No. \nGRAHAM Shall we try and storm the Citadel before we nod off? \nCLIVE Couldn't hurt could it? We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV. The boys lie on their beds holding games controllers. \nCLIVE Cover me. \nINT. HOTEL. RECEPTION - MORNING \nGRAHAM and CLIVE stand at reception. Both look extremely sleepy. CLIVE's eyes close. GRAHAM lolls forward onto the reception desk. His head hits the bell. \nDING! \nEXT. HOTEL - MORNING \nThe boys stand, waiting for their transport. We see them from across the road. A tiny old car splutters up to the curb. A valet gets out and hands the keys to CLIVE. \nVALET There you go. \nGRAHAM That's not ours. \nVALET No? \nCLIVE No, that's ours. A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of the range in its day. Still looks good. \nGRAHAM/CLIVE \"Alien Onboard.\"\u009d \nPAT Nice choice. So, where have you boys come from? \nGRAHAM \n(MUMBLY) San Diego. \nPAT Comic-Con? \nCLIVE How could you tell? We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever. \nPAT Just a guess. My nephew launched a comic down there a couple of years ago. Sort of dramatized the accounts of some of the folk we've had in here. \nCLIVE Encounter Briefs? \nPAT That's it. You heard of it, huh? \nCLIVE I've got all six. \nPAT Well whaddya know? Small world. \nCLIVE Do you get a lot of UFO types round here? We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face. \nPAT Some. \nGRAHAM Have you ever seen one? \nPAT A UFO? Oh, I've seen plenty. \nGRAHAM Really?! You've seen more than one UFOs? \nPAT Well, I don't know what they were. So as far as I'm concerned they're unidentified and they were definitely flying. \nCLIVE And objects. \nPAT Damn straight. Whether or not they were spaceships, I can't say. Probably not, but I'd like to think they were. Be a shame if we were the only souls in the universe. \nCLIVE Did you now, it's estimated that there are as many as 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe and each of those has approximately 40 billion starts, around which orbit countless planets and moons? \nPAT Yes. \nCLIVE Oh. \nPAT Makes you think though, don't it? \nCLIVE What? \nPAT Where is everybody? GRAHAM and CLIVE ponder this. \nPAT You boys all set? \nCLIVE I'd like a cup of coffee please. \nPAT Sure thing. How about you, sugar? \nGRAHAM Can I have an E.T. malt please? \nPAT You wanna sparkler in that? GRAHAM smiles coyly. \nPAT I'll take that as a yes. She beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen. GRAHAM and CLIVE are left alone. They take it all in. \nCLIVE It's nice here, isn't it? \nGRAHAM Absolutely. \nCLIVE I think I might use the loo. CLIVE walks through a door marked \"\u0098Maliens'. The adjacent toilet door (GUS and JAKE) enter. GRAHAM becomes uneasy. \nPAT Yes dear, what can I get you? \nJAKE Two beers. \nPAT Coming right up. \nINT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. TOILET - EVENING \nCLIVE washes his hands. He pumps soap from a dispenser which is shaped like an alien's head, the soap squirts out of its mouth. CLIVE is quite taken with this. \nCLIVE That is absolutely amazing! \nINT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING \nCLIVE appears out of the toilet with his hands in the air. \nGRAHAM The Groom Lake Military Test Facility. \nCLIVE MacArthur's Black Mile. \nGRAHAM Is that a real one? \nCLIVE No, I made it up myself. \nGRAHAM I like it. \nCLIVE Be great if we saw something. \nGRAHAM Yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by a craft. \nCLIVE That would be incredible. It just sort of stops in the air and hovers then just goes up really fast. Whoosh. \nGRAHAM What would you do if they actually landed? \nCLIVE Keep it together. First contact is a big responsibility. They come in peace, we go to pieces? That's not how I roll. CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed. \nCLIVE What's wrong? GRAHAM points off into the distance. HEADLIGHTS. \nGRAHAM It's them. They found us. I don't know how but they found us. \nCLIVE Who? Who's found us? \nGRAHAM The Libyans! \nCLIVE Run for it Marty! GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV. \nINT. RV - NIGHT \nCLIVE drives, GRAHAM looks nervous. In the dashboard of the RV is a rear view monitor. They look at it intently. \nGRAHAM Perhaps it's not them. Perhaps whoever it was turned doff. \nCLIVE Of course it's them. We're dead. It's like Deliverance. They're going to rape us and break our arms. \nGRAHAM I don't want my arms broken! \nCLIVE There's only one thing for it. \nGRAHAM What? \nCLIVE I'm gonna have to fly blind. \nCLIVE kills the headlights. They are plunged into darkness, still travelling at 65mph. The headlights come back on. \nCLIVE Probably best not to do that. I couldn't really see anything. They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible. \nCLIVE Oh God, oh God, oh God. \nGRAHAM I need the toilet. \nCLIVE Me too. The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake. \nCLIVE They're trying to overtake. \nGRAHAM Don't let them get past. \nCLIVE Should I ram them? \nGRAHAM What about the deposit? CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times, bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks. \nCLIVE It wasn't them. The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out of the window. \nCLIVE We should see if they're okay. \nGRAHAM I still need a wee. \nCLIVE I can hold mine. GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears. \nGRAHAM The bulb's gone in there. \nEXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nGRAHAM and CLIVE step out of the RV and approach the car. Inside are three unconscious men. One door is open. \nCLIVE Hello? They wait for a few seconds. Nothing. \nGRAHAM Maybe you should call for help. GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial. \nVOICE (O.S.) I wouldn't do that if I were you. GRAHAM and CLIVE spin round to see an indistinct figure sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness. The glow of a cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large, black eyes. GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp. \nINT/EXT. RV - NIGHT \nGRAHAM drives, agitated. He looks behind him a couple of times. PAUL is hunting around in the fridge. \nPAUL Can I have this ham? \nGRAHAM Uh... yes. \nPAUL Great! PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth, wolfing it down hungrily. \nGRAHAM Paul? Where am I going again? \nPAUL I told you, North. Do you have a map? GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield. \nPAUL Not when we're driving, Graham. \nThe map disappears back up into the roller. \nGRAHAM Sorry. \nPAUL Just head North. We need to get as much distance as we can between us and them. \nGRAHAM Them? Who's them? \nEXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nWe hear the noise of engines, then boots on concrete as a dozen soldiers rush the area, attending the crash. A suited man gets out of a Sedan car. We don't see his face at first. The shot remains at his hip. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a Twinkie. He unwraps it and brings it up to his mouth. We follow and see his face for the first time. Chiselled, focused, confident. This is SPECIAL AGENT ZOIL. A SOLDIER approaches. \nCAPTAIN Sir? \nZOIL Talk to me. \nCAPTAIN Three survivors, company men, hurt but alive. \nZOIL Anyone else? \nCAPTAIN No sir. ZOIL looks into the sky and breathes in the night air. \nCAPTAIN What's this? The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet. ZOIL touches the wet patch and licks his finger. \nCAPTAIN What is it sir? Brake fluid? Gas? \nZOIL No. It's neither of those things. He looks around, then notices tire tracks in the dust by the side of the road. ZOIL stands, full of purpose. He returns to his car and hits a button on the dash. \nVOICE What's the situation? \nZOIL We have a guest who's left the hotel without paying, sir. \nVOICE Damn it! Do you think he's \"\u0098left' left? \nZOIL Doubtful. NORAD would have picked up a bogie. Those guys can track Santa. No sir, he's still here. Question is, for how long? \nVOICE Don't you think this is all a bit of a coincidence? \nZOIL How so? \nVOICE I signed the red document this morning, Zoil. Don't you think it's odd that he chooses today to go AWOL? How did he know? \nZOIL Are you suggesting he has someone on the inside. \nVOICE Maybe. \nZOIL Well he's definitely got someone on the outside. \nVOICE What? \nZOIL Tire tracks, sir. Tire tracks... among other things. I'd bet my left nut that little bastard's hitched a ride. \nVOICE Lock down the area. Road blocks, spot checks, the whole nine yards. You're going to handle this personally, Zoil. I want this wrapped up before Letterman. \nEXT/INT. RV. NIGHT - A FEW HOURS LATER \nClose on the wheel. Pull out to reveal the RV. Inside, CLIVE's eyes open. From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder. He notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry. He leans out to see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the bathroom door. The toilet flushes. CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens. A pair of skinny grey legs in cut-off shorts pass the bunk. \nPAUL The bulb's gone in there. CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his middle. He creeps toward the front of the RV. GRAHAM drives, PAUL sits in the Chewie seat eating pistachios. \nPAUL I hate it when you get the closed ones, right? \nGRAHAM I usually bite them open. \nPAUL Are you fucking insane? You gotta tap \"\u0098em and if they don't open you throw them away. \nGRAHAM That's molluscs. \nAGENT 1 Is that right? \nAGENT 2 (O.S.) Hey Haggard?! \nHAGGARD Yeah? O'REILLY appears at the door waving a 10x8\"\u009d photograph. \nO'REILLY These guys have met Michael Biehn. \nHAGGARD No shit! How was he? \nCLIVE He was a good egg. \nGRAHAM Very unaffected. \nHAGGARD That's nice to hear. \n(TO AGENT 2) O'Reilly? Anything else? \nO'REILLY Just some pissy jeans. HAGGARD looks down at the towel wrapped around CLIVE's waits. CLIVE look embarrassed. \nHAGGARD Okay, you guys can go. \nCLIVE Thank you. May I ask what you're searching for? \nHAGGARD Of course you may. There is a slight pause. GRAHAM and CLIVE board the RV. \nINT/EXT. RV - NIGHT \nGRAHAM and CLIVE pull away in silence. They are both confused and shaken. \nCLIVE Well, it's pretty obvious what happened there, isn't it? \nGRAHAM Is it? \nCLIVE Yes, the government used some sort of neurotoxic paint on the Black Mailbox, which was white by the way, and it caused us to suffer a shared hallucination about an alien. I mean, it's what we've always wanted, isn't it? \nGRAHAM I suppose so. \nCLIVE Than that's what happened. PAUL materializes from thin air behind them. \nPAUL \nWRONG! \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT \nThe sound of screeching tires draws the attention of the two AGENTS. They see the RV swerve across the road in the distance before righting itself and continuing on its way. \nINT. RV - NIGHT \nCLIVE Where the hell did you go? \nPAUL Nowhere. \nGRAHAM What, you went invisible? \nPAUL It's not invisibility per so. It's more like what a chameleon does with a little light blending thrown in for good measure. \nGRAHAM Like Predator? \nPAUL Exactly. \nGRAHAM Can you do it whenever you want? \nPAUL \n(PREDATOR VOICE) Anytime... \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nWe hear GRAHAM squeal with delight. The RV guns up the road into the night. \nINT. RV - DAYBREAK \nCLIVE drives in silence. PAUL sits in the passenger seat eating nuts. Day is breaking over the horizon. GRAHAM snoozes on the sofa. PAUL offers CLIVE a nut. \nCLIVE No thank you. \nPAUL You sure? How about a cup of coffee? (sees he's tempted) Come on Hulk, I'll get you a nice cuppa J. PAUL goes back to the galley, flicking GRAHAM on the nose as he passes. GRAHAM wakes up with a start. \nPAUL Hey, look who's up! \nGRAHAM Hello Paul. GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him. \nCHRIS They find out how you can afford a Dodge Viper on troopers pay? \nSTATE TROOPER Not yet. They're all over this crash on the road up to Rachel. \nCHRIS What you think's going on? \nSTATE TROOPER Don't know, could be Muslims. \nCHRIS Jesus Cheeerist! CLIVE and GRAHAM sidle up to the check-out. \nSTATE TROOPER You go right ahead. \nCLIVE Thank you very much, officer. \nSTATE TROOPER Where're you guys from? \nGRAHAM Britain. \nSTATE TROOPER Britain, huh? Nice place. No guns! \nCHRIS No guns? Jesus Cheeerist. CHRIS take the money and the boys leave. The STATE TROOPER and CHRIS watch them go. \nEXT. GAS STATION - MORNING \nThe boys hurry across the forecourt past the cop car, we hear the radio spring to life as they pass. \nPOLICE CONTROLLER All units, be on the lookout for a cream and brown Recreational Vehicle, no plate number at this time. Officers are advised to contain but not board. Dean, if you still at Gas and Go, bring back a quart a milk and a box of doughnut holes? Dean? GRAHAM and CLIVE stop and stare, listening intently. \nHOOOOOOONNNNNNKKKKK! \nINT. RV - SOMETIME LATER \nPAUL sit on the sofa catching M&Ms in his mouth. GRAHAM drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat. \nCLIVE It's find for you. You'll get whisked back to whatever lab they kept you in and we'll be arrested for harbouring a fugitive and sent to Guantanamo Bay. PAUL laughs. \nCLIVE Why's everything so funny? They think we're Muslims. \nPAUL That's their excuse for everything. There are worse things you can be. We had a Muslim guy at the base. Systems analyst called Yusef. We used to do karaoke on Tuesday nights. You should'a heard him do Matthew and Son. Shame I didn't get a chance to say salam alaikum. \nCLIVE Paul, the authorities know we're in an TV. \nPAUL We're hardly the only RV on the road. Trust me, if we stay off the highways, keep to the back routes, we'll have a nice uneventful journey. BANG!!! Something strikes the windshield. Everyone jumps. GRAHAM bring the RV to a halt. Silence. \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY \nThe door to the RV swings open, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out. The desert road is silent. We can see for miles. On the road lies a yellow and black bird, it is very dead. \nPAUL Fuck, that made me jump. \nCLIVE Ah yes, the waspish markings of a Scott's Oriole. Unmistakable. \nPAUL What a waste. \nGRAHAM Poor thing. \nCLIVE Nothing anyone could've done. PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands. \nGRAHAM What are you doing? PAUL closes his eyes. His skin ripples with color as he sways slightly. The bird's eyes flicker, its head lifts, it opens its beak and tweets. GRAHAM and CLIVE are astounded by what they are seeing. \nGRAHAM It's a miracle! \nPAUL stuff the bird in his mouth with a grotesque crunch. \nPAUL I'll miss these. \nCLIVE Why would you do that? \nPAUL I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am \nI? \nEXT. GAS STATION - DAY \nZOIL and his men are parked on the forecourt of the gas station. ZOIL is talking to the STATE TROOPER and CHRIS. \nSTATE TROOPER By the time I got the bulletin, they were long gone. Seemed like nice fellas to me. \nCHRIS Is it true they was Muslims? \nSTATE TROOPER They said they were British. \nZOIL I think you can be both. \nPAUL Okay, that's great. I just wondered. I'm cool with it. Everyone's \"\u0098bi' where I'm from. It's all about the pleasure thing, you know? We've evolved beyond paranoid notions of gender identity. I mean, procreation is only the functional aspect of sexual congress right? The human race is fairly advanced but most males still act like a cornered tiger if you imply the like \"\u0098smoking the bone' and let's face it they probably do. Look at single sex, empirical institutions, boarding schools, prisons, pirate ships, places where the choice has been removed, everyone's banging everyone else and there isn't a whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get out into the real world and guys are getting smacked int he chops for wearing pink socks. You think you're so sophisticated because you can distinguish yourself from your own reflection but ultimately you're part of a deeply neurotic species and you'd all be a lot better off if you stopped worrying and learned to love the bum. \nCLIVE What are you trying to say? \nPAUL Maybe you should start smoking. \nINT. RV - EVENING \nLater, the RV pulls up to gate at the front of an RV park. GRAHAM is now in the Chewie seat, PAUL stands behind, steadying himself on the backs of their chairs. \nCLIVE Great find, Graham. \nGRAHAM I sourced a website listing off the beaten track, North American RV parks. \nPAUL I really lucked out with you nerds, didn't I? GRAHAM and CLIVE look proud. CLIVE drives the RV over a speed hump into the park. PAUL loses his balance and falls over. GRAHAM and CLIVE laugh. They pull up to a gate. \nGRAHAM It's awfully quiet. \nCLIVE Just the way we like it. PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on the horn. \nHOOOOOOONNNNK! \nCLIVE Stop doing that! \nGRAHAM Someone's coming. PAUL shimmers and disappears. GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp. \nVOICE Hello? \nCLIVE (quietly to Graham) We're just a couple of regular guys on a tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest. \nGRAHAM I don't think she heard you. \nCLIVE I was talking to you. \nGRAHAM Oh, sorry. \nVOICE Hello? GRAHAM opens the door. RUTH BEHE, a young woman in her mid- twenties stands outside. She is pretty but has no idea. She wears glasses, one eye of which is blacked out. GRAHAM stares at her. We hear the slide guitar moment from Olivia Newton John's \"Hopelessly Devoted To You\"\u009d. \nRUTH Good evening, I'm Ruth Behe. \nCLIVE Hello Ruth. Do you mind if we come in? \nRUTH Sure. Park in Bay 9. The charge is $50 for the night, plus $10 for hook ups an I'll need to hang onto an ID too. CLIVE disappears, leaving GRAHAM and RUTH alone. \nGRAHAM We're just a couple of regular guys on tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest. \nRUTH Where you heading next? \nGRAHAM Uh, east... apparently. CLIVE returns with his passport. RUTH looks at it. \nRUTH England? \nCLIVE Yes. London. \nRUTH I love London. \nCLIVE Have you been? \nRUTH No. Did you know it was founded by the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium? \nGRAHAM/CLIVE Yes. \nRUTH Oh. I'd love to go someday. \nGRAHAM You should. \nRUTH There's lots a places I wanna go. Europe. Asia. The Antipodes. The world's a big place. I need one of these though. \nCLIVE You don't have a passport? RUTH shakes her head forlornly. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) RUTH! RUTH! Get in here! I'm hungry \nRUTH That's my father. I'll come over and take your money in the morning. Have a pleasant night now, won't you? RUTH opens the gate to allow CLIVE to drive through. GRAHAM watches RUTH intently as they pass. \nCLIVE Doors to manual and cross check. Graham? Graham? \nGRAHAM Hmmm? PAUL re-materializes next to GRAHAM and CLIVE. \nPAUL \nBOO! \nEXT. RV PARK - NIGHT \nPAUL I know, right? Time flies when you're confined to a U.S. military installation. \nCLIVE Why did you come to earth? \nPAUL I'm the vanguard of a highly aggressive invading force. \nCLIVE What?! \nPAUL I'm fucking with you, man. I was on a science mission actually. Meteorological reconnaissance. We were surveying atmospheric conditions on CO2 spiking, M-Class planets. My specialist subject is tornadoes right? So I'm buzzing around the mid-west, looking for twisters and all of a sudden my A.G.G. goes offline and I crash in the middle of some field. \n(MORE) \nPAUL (CONT'D) Next thing I know, this little girl is pulling me out of the wreck and then a bunch of army guys come along and cart me off to Area 52. \nCLIVE \nPAUL No, it's 52. Area 51 is just full of old Pan Am jets and mini disc players and shit. It's another \"clever subterfuge.\"\u009d GRAHAM joins them with the food. \nPAUL Just telling him about Area 52. \nGRAHAM Ha ha yeah. \nPAUL So, with my cover blown and the natives cautious but friendly, I figured we might as well indulge in a little file sharing. \nCLIVE Mulder was right! \nPAUL Mulder was my idea. They chuckle. CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas. \nCLIVE Would you like a go? PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the Hendrix face. They laugh loudly. \nEXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT \nRUTH watches through her window. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL are on the other side of the RV. Nevertheless, RUTH can see three pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle, silhouetted against the campfire. She frowns. \nMOSES BEHE (O.S.) \nRUTH! RUTH backs away into the shadows. \nINT. RV - MORNING \nIt is very early in the morning. PAUL is asleep on the sofa. There is a knock at the door. PAUL vanishes. GRAHAM and CLIVE emerge from the bedroom in dressing gowns. \nCLIVE Who is it? \nRUTH (O.S.) It's Ruth. GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other nervously. CLIVE opens the door, as GRAHAM straightens his hair. \nRUTH Good morning. \nCLIVE Good morning. \nRUTH May I come in? \nGRAHAM Yes. CLIVE give GRAHAM a \"\u0098what the hell are you thinking?' Look as RUTH comes aboard. RUTH surveys the interior of the RV. \nRUTH Was everything to your liking? \nCLIVE Yes, thank you. \nRUTH Where's the other one? \nCLIVE The other one? \nRUTH It's okay, we don't charge by the person. That was three pairs of legs I saw last night cavorting round the camp fire, right? \nCLIVE Oh the other one. Um... \nPAUL I'm in the can. I ate a closed mollusc. PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point. GRAHAM and CLIVE look embarrassed. GRAHAM changes the subject. \nGRAHAM I like your shirt. The shirt has a picture of Jesus shooting Charles Darwin in the head. Underneath it reads, \"Evolve this!\"\u009d \nRUTH Thanks. I got it at my church. \nGRAHAM Why would Jesus want to shoot Charles Darwin? \nRUTH \n(BRIGHTLY) Because of his theories. Are you men of God? \nGRAHAM Would you like a coffee? \nCLIVE I suppose we're men of science. \nGRAHAM \nPAUL burst out of the BEHE RESIDENCE, pursued by MOSES who is loading a shotgun. \nPAUL \nGO! GO! GO! The RV start to move forward. The door swings open and GRAHAM appears, beckoning to PAUL. PAUL reaches the door, just as MOSES levels the gun at his target. PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a booming shot. The BEHE mailbox explodes into pieces, as the RV careens off out of the trailer park. \nINT. RV - DAY \nBlackness. RUTH wakes up. Panic in her eyes. CLIVE drives, GRAHAM sits on the sofa, biting his nails. \nGRAHAM Hi. \nRUTH Where am I? PAUL leans round from the Chewie seat and smile. \nPAUL Hey, look who's up. \nRUTH \nDEMON! \nGRAHAM Would you like a cup of tea? RUTH starts to pray furiously. \nGRAHAM I'm so sorry it had to be this way Ruth. We're definitely not going to hurt you and we'll let you go as son as we can. We were just a little concerned that you might call the police. \nRUTH You have been deceived. Deceived by an agent of Satan himself. \nPAUL (O.S.) You know I'm sitting right here? \nGRAHAM He's not a demon Ruth, he's from another world and we're helping him get home. He's not evil. He's just very rude. \nRUTH How can he be from another world? There is only one world. Our world, created by God the Father. PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM. RUTH whimpers. \nPAUL Look, if it makes you feel any better, my existence only disproves the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo- Christian God, as well as all single earth theologies. Science still hasn't categorically rule out the notion of divinity, even though evolutionary biology suggest the non-existence of a creator by probability alone. \nRUTH How could that possibly make me feel any better? \nPAUL Jesus Christ, I was just trying to be nice! \nGRAHAM I think what Paul's trying to say is, just because there are other inhabited planets, it's not the end of the world. \nRUTH This isn't happening! You're a hallucination. You're not real. You're a test. A test from God. \nPAUL You can't win can you? RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an awful noise. \nCLIVE I can't drive like this. We'll have to drop her off and take our chances. \nGRAHAM No! \nPAUL Oh, for God's sake. PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAUL telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind. They collapse in a heap on the floor. PAUL sparks up a cigarette. \nGRAHAM What did you do to her?! \nPAUL I broadened her horizons. \nGRAHAM Can you broaden mine? \nPAUL No, it's tiring. GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying. \nGRAHAM Oh please. \nPAUL Come here then. PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all fluttery. We don't see the images this time. GRAHAM falls. \nCLIVE Oh great! Everyone knows the secrets of the universe apart from me. He always knew what was going on in Buffy before me because his mum had cable. \nPAUL Can't I just tell you? \nCLIVE No spoilers! PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps CLIVE who falls to the floor. Everyone lays inert. \nGRAHAM \n(WEAKLY) Maybe I should make that tea? \nEXT. RV PARK - DAY \nTHREE BLACK SEDANS are parked in the BEHE RV park. \nMOSES BEHE (O.S.) I didn't call the government. I called the po-lice. \nINT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY \nZOIL Given your description of the intruder, the police felt your call was perhaps better directed to us. \nMOSES BEHE And who are you? \nGRAHAM Are you alright? \nRUTH He can't be from space. It's not possible. \nGRAHAM Ruth, you saw for yourself. It's not just possible, it's probably. There's probably millions of intelligent civilizations. \nRUTH So, where is everybody? \nGRAHAM Well, one of them is right there. RUTH and GRAHAM look back at the RV. PAUL is stood on the dashboard with his bare buttocks pressed against the window. CLIVE is trying not to laugh. \nRUTH Everything I've ever been told is a lie. My purpose. My truth. All false. DO you know how that feels? To suddenly have nothing? \nGRAHAM Just because your truth wasn't the truth, it doesn't mean there is no truth, Ruth. \nRUTH Huh? \nGRAHAM I understand you're probably feeling very confused right now. Religious belief systems are devised to give us context and security. To stop us feeling lonely and unimportant. \nRUTH I do feel lonely and unimportant! How can this all be an accident? It doesn't make sense. Did you know the reason we have solar eclipses is because the sun is exactly 400 times bigger than the moon and the moon is exactly 400 times closer to the earth? GRAHAM considers saying \"\u0098yes' but decides against it. \nRUTH How can that be an accident. \nGRAHAM It isn't, it's a coincidence. Or it probably is. That's the beauty of the universe. \nRUTH But what's the point? If there's nothing afterwards, what's the point in living? \nGRAHAM This is the point, Ruth. Right now. This conversation. That tree, your next cheeseburger. Life is a miracle. People spend so much time focusing on rescuing the princess, they forget how much fun it is to fight the dragon. \nRUTH Huh? \nGRAHAM Carl Sagan said \"\u0098A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.' \nRUTH Huh? \nGRAHAM It's okay not to know, Ruth. It's wonderful because it means we still have things to learn. We still have life to live. \nRUTH I'm frightened. \nGRAHAM So am I, but it passes, sort of. Ruth, we're on an amazing adventure and I think you should come with us. I know you feel confused and lost but if you get back on board that RV, you might just find the very thing you're looking for. \nRUTH I... I'm not sure. \nGRAHAM I'm sure Ruth. I'm sure because I can honestly say, I have never talked to a woman for this long without blushing. \nRUTH That's so sweet. GRAHAM blushes, deep, dark, red. \nINT. RV - DAY \nGRAHAM and RUTH get back onto the RV. GRAHAM looks pleased with himself. \nGRAHAM She's going to be fine. I think your hair looks good by the way. You look like Storm. \nRUTH Who's Storm? \nPAUL From X-Men. \nGRAHAM Exactly. RUTH goes to the bathroom. \nRUTH (O.S.) \nAAARRRRGGGHHHHH! MY FREAKIN' HAIR! \nEXT/INT. RV - DAY \nThe RV drives across the rugged countryside. GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL appear in various combinations. GRAHAM drives with PAUL in the Chewie seat, CLIVE sleeps on the sofa, RUTH can be seen sitting on the bed at the back. CLIVE drives with GRAHAM in the Chewie seat. PAUL just behind, RUTH on the sofa. She is staring at PAUL. PAUL turns round, she looks away. PAUL drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat, GRAHAM and RUTH just behind. The RV weaves from side to side. \nCLIVE Small corrections! Small corrections! RUTH drives. Everyone else is asleep. \nEXT/INT. ZOIL'S CAR/HAGGARD'S CAR/O'REILLY'S CAR - DAY \nWe see ZOIL's convoy. ZOIL drives, his eyes intent on the road, searching. He reaches down out of shot, then brings a taco to hi mouth and takes a bit. A truck passes. We see HAGGARD in his car, talking animatedly on his cell phone. The truck passes. We see O'REILLY in his car, he is asleep at the wheel. The truck passes, horn blaring. O'REILLY wakes up suddenly, looking rattled. \nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY \nThe RV is parked up. It is a little speck on an enormous landscape. Next to the highway is a sign which reads \"\u0098YOU ARE NOW LEAVING UTAH.' Underneath this a separate sign reads \n\"\u0098LEAVING PACIFIC TIME ZONE ENTERING MOUNTAIN TIME ZONE.' PAUL leaps back and forth over the line. \nPAUL 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock. Come on! It's fun. We see CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH standing in the middle of the road watching PAUL. \nRUTH This is the furthest I've ever been. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nCLIVE Thank you. He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers. \nGRAHAM You can sleep in my bunk if you'd like. She smiles at him. He goes to leave but turns back. \nGRAHAM I'd use a pen to push the tissues off the bed. I've had a cold. \nEXT. DESERTED TOWN - NIGHT \nGRAHAM and PAUL stand outside a liquor store on the main drag of a quiet town. Next door is a Western themed clothing store. PAUL looks in the window. \nPAUL Hey Graham. Check this out. What d'ya think? PAUL indicates to a small cowboy outfit, big enough for a child, displayed in the window. \nPAUL I'd look pretty hot, right? \nGRAHAM Space cowboy. \nPAUL Steve Miller Band. I love that song. Speaking of midnight tokers, I got a littler herbal refreshment in my pants. Do you guys partake? \nGRAHAM No. \nPAUL Shame. I get it from the military. This is the shit that killed Dylan. \nGRAHAM Bob Dylan's still alive. \nPAUL Is he? CLIVE comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer. \nCLIVE Let's party! \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nGRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL have made a camp fire in a woodland clearing on the other side of town. They sit round drinking beers and chatting. PAUL rolls a joint. \nGRAHAM So why \"\u0098Paul'? It's not very, you know, alien. \nCLIVE Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or something? \nPAUL No. \nGRAHAM P-o-o-u-r-l? \nPAUL No, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or the little guy from Simon and Garfunkel. \nCLIVE Paul Simon. \nPAUL Paul Simon. Paul's not my real name. It's a name I got given. \nGRAHAM What's your real name? \nPAUL You won't be able to pronounce it. \nCLIVE I can speak Klingon. \nPAUL What a geek. \nCLIVE Hey! \nGRAHAM Come on, what's your real name. PAUL opens his mouth and screeches. \nPAUL Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa. \nCLIVE Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa. \nPAUL That's pretty good. \nGRAHAM Rootchaa? That sounds like Roger. \nPAUL Fuck you! \nCLIVE Calm down, Rog. More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint. \nGRAHAM You look like a poster on a student's wall. \nPAUL That was my gag! \"\u0098Take me to your dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine. Never saw a dime. \nGRAHAM You never answered my question. Why Paul? Who called you Paul? \nPAUL The little girl who found me when I crashed. It was terrible actually. I killed her dog. I didn't mean to! My ship sort of landed on it. When the military arrived I was delirious; I kept saying \"Paul? Paul?\"\u009d It was the only English I knew, because I'd heard the little girl saying it over and over. Spooks thought it was my name. \nCLIVE She called her dog Paul? \nPAUL Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles. \nGRAHAM What happened to the little girl? \nThe sun has just risen. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL lie round the smoldering camp fire sleeping soundly. PAUL is very white. His eyes open. He looks around. \nPAUL Oh shit! Hey, wake up. Wake up. We fell asleep. \nCLIVE How did that happen? \nPAUL Sorry, I get this thing when I get high. It's called \"\u0098projective empathy'. You feel what I feel. \nGRAHAM Like in E.T.? \nPAUL Exactly. \nCLIVE Oh, thank God. For a second there I thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer. The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood. Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet town of last night has become very busy indeed. \nGRAHAM Oh dear! \nPAUL I can't walk through there. \nCLIVE How are we going to get back? Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life. \nEXT. TOWN - DAY \nGRAHAM and CLIVE walk down the busy main street, between them is PAUL. He is dressed in the little cowboy suit from the shop window, his hat pulled down low over his face. \nGRAHAM Maybe we should hold hands, so that we look like a family. \nPAUL That's great! Two grown men who look like sex offenders holding hands with a child cowboy. \nCLIVE You could be a midget. \nPAUL You're obsessed with midgets! They continue on, trying to look as if nothing is strange. \nGRAHAM Seem to be working, Clive. Clive? GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them. He looks back to see CLIVE, gawping thought the window of a COMIC SHOP, at a sword resembling the one they saw at Comic-Con. The tag reads \"\u0098Genuine \"\u0098BLADE' Katana'. $299.99. \nGRAHAM Clive, no. CLIVE walks into the shop. GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly behind. As they enter the COMIC SHOP, MOSES BEHE emerges from the adjacent Drug Store. He takes a couple of pain killers and flexes his sore shoulders. He wanders up the road, scanning the passers by. \nINT. COMIC SHOP - DAY \nGRAHAM approaches CLIVE who is at the counter. \nGRAHAM Now's not really the time, Sausage. \nCLIVE I must have it. \nGRAHAM It's very cheap. Are you sure you don't want to save up and get a proper on? \nCLIVE Oh, come on, we've got time. \nINT/EXT. RV - DAY \nClose on RUTH's watch. She paces, worried. \nKNOCK KNOCK. \nRUTH Where have you been? I was worried. She opens the door. AGENT ZOIL flashes his badge. \nZOIL Good morning, Ma'am. Sorry to trouble you. Agent Zoil, Secret Service. Your wagon here matches the description of a recreational vehicle we're currently looking for. May I ask, are you alone? RUTH pauses a second. \nRUTH Yes, I'm alone. \nZOIL Do you mind taking a look at these pictures? ZOIL pulls out three pictures and hands them to RUTH. CCTV shots of GRAHAM and CLIVE at the gas station and MOSES's pic of RUTH, looking younger, with dark hair and no glasses. \nZOIL Do you recognise any of these people, Miss? She lingers on the picture of herself. \nZOIL Miss? \nRUTH No, sorry I don't. \nZOIL Where are you coming from, Ma'am? \nRUTH Christian ministry in Seattle. I've been driving for 5 days. \nZOIL Going far? \nRUTH Austin. \nZOIL Great town. \nRUTH Oh yes. It has an impressive bat population you know? \n(MORE) \nRUTH (CONT'D) Folks gather by the rive in the evening to watch them fly out. Turn the sky black. Quite a sight. \nMRS. NASH Oh, come on now, Keith. If you carry on like this, you'll have to come with me to Dress Barn. \nKEITH NASH Honestly Mommy, he was an alien and his name was Paul! \nMRS. NASH Whoever hard of an alien called Paul? \nHAGGARD is suddenly kneeling at KEITH NASH's side. O'REILLY stands nearby. \nHAGGARD What did you say, kid? \nMRS. NASH Excuse me. Who are you? \nHAGGARD Agent Haggard Ma'am, Secret Service. \nMRS. NASH Secret Service?! \nHAGGARD Kid? \nKEITH NASH He was in the shop. \nHAGGARD Is he still in there? KEITH shakes his head. \nO'REILLY Did he say where he was going? KEITH looks at his comic. The ZOIL style agent, shooting the PAUL style alien. He looks back at HAGGARD and points him in the entirely wrong direction. \nHAGGARD South. Toward New Mexico, huh? KEITH nods. HAGGARD stands, his mind racing. He looks meaningfully at O'REILLY not noticing the RV rumbling up the street behind him with CLIVE at the wheel. \nO'REILLY We've got him man! We're going to get a fucking promotion. \nHAGGARD You did good kid. Want a candy? \nKEITH NASH No thanks. \nHAGGARD Let's go. The two agents rush off. \nO'REILLY What about Zoil? \nHAGGARD Screw Zoil! \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nMOSES BEHE kicks at the remains of the campfire. He bends down and picks something up. It is Ruth's handkerchief, now stained with dirt and blood. He screws it into his shaking hand. An engine roars. He looks up to see the RV rumbling up the road. It turns onto the Eastbound Highway. MOSES' pick up is parked about 200 yards away. MOSES starts to lumber towards it as fast as he can, which isn't very fast. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nHAGGARD and O'REILLY sprint up to their vehicles. \nZOIL (O.S.) Where the hell do you think you're going? HAGGARD can't hide his frustration. \nHAGGARD We picked up a lead, sir. Little kid in the town said he saw an alien. Said he was heading toward New Mexico. \nZOIL And you were just gonna take off? \nHAGGARD Thought it best to take the initiative, sir. We were going to radio you. \nZOIL Well now, that's mighty civil of you. We have a chain of command. I expect you to abide by it. Where d'you say he was headed? \nHAGGARD New Mexico sir. \nZOIL Well, then let's move it. They scramble. \nZOIL Oh, and Haggard? Don't go getting ideas about your station again. ZOIL gets into his car leaving HAGGARD looking pissed. \nINT. MOSES'S PICK UP - DAY \nMOSES drives, Ruth's bloody handkerchief gripped between his hands and the wheel. He listens to his police scanner. \nVOICE (O.S.) Zoil, what the hell's going on? \nZOIL (O.S.) They've double back sir. They're heading toward New Mexico. \nVOICE (O.S.) You better be right about this, Zoil. I'm getting a little tired of this shit. I want that little fucker's brain in a jar by sundown. MOSES smiles darkly. \nMOSES BEHE Looks like you're going the wrong way, Agent Zoil. That's what happens when you don't got the Lord on your side. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nMOSES BEHE's pick up roars through shot, revealing a large roadside sign proclaiming LUCIFER'S CUT PRICE FIREWORK WAREHOUSE. Creep in on the sign. \nINT. RV - DAYBREAK \nThe RV is parked outside the firework warehouse. RUTH and PAUL sit opposite each other at the dining table. RUTH is holding the X-Men action figure, Storm. PAUL watches her. \nPAUL He likes you, y'know? \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - EVENING \nCaption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL stare through the window of the RV at the farmhouse glimpsed in the first scene. \nGRAHAM You don't think she's still there do you? \nPAUL That's what you're going to find out for me. \nCLIVE Us? \nPAUL I can't just knock can I? What if she's moved on and someone else answers? I'm sick of people fainting on me. I'll hang back with my buddy Ruth, you two make first contact. Just enjoy it. \nCLIVE What shall we say if it's her? We're here with the alien that killed your dog sixty years ago? \nPAUL Yes. Hurry up, there's going to be a really big storm in exactly 34 minutes. \nRUTH How do you know? \nPAUL It's my job to know. \nEXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY \nGRAHAM knocks on the door. \nGRAHAM Hello? \nCLIVE Knock again. \nVOICE (O.S.) Who's there? \nCLIVE Tara Walton? \nVOICE (O.S.) Leave me alone! \nGRAHAM Okay. GRAHAM goes to leave. CLIVE stops him. \nCLIVE Miss Walton, I'm the writer, Clive Gollings and this is my friend and colleague, Graham Willy. We're from England and we're here with the alien that killed your dog 60 years ago. Silence. The sound of multiple locks. The door opens to reveal a woman (68). Grey, dishevelled but with fire in her eyes. She scowls at GRAHAM and CLIVE. \nTARA What is this, some kind of joke? \nCLIVE It's no joke. PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE. \nPAUL Hello Tara. TARA's faces sickens. She falls backwards into the house. \nPAUL Aw nuts. \nINT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY \nGRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL all sit on a sofa. TARA sits opposite, staring at PAUL. \nRUTH Maybe I should make some tea. \nTARA Where are my manners? I never really have guests. Nobody comes up here. I go whole weeks without seeing a soul. \nTARA goes to the kitchen. She can be seen from where they are sitting. She turns the gas on and strikes a cooking match. PAUL looks pained, struggling for something to say. \nPAUL Can I do anything to help? TARA stand in the kitchen doorway, the lit match in her hand. PAUL stands and walks toward her, she watches him. \nTARA I've only just stopped believing in you, y'know? Spent a very long time trying to convince folk about what happened that night. My parents, my friends. Everyone thought I was mad. They told me it was a meteor that squashed little Paul. Took me away and did tests they did, said it was for cosmic radiation. They said I was concussed, hallucinating, but I knew you were real. I pulled you from that spaceship myself. Sat with you till the men came and took you away. If Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he would have seen you too. They kept telling me I'd imagined it but I knew different. Pop tried to understand but they filled his head with \"\u0098delayed this' and \"\u0098post- traumatic that'. He just used to smile and say \"\u0098there, there Tara'. He got sick when I was seventeen and died a few years later. I inherited this place. Word got out about my story not long after it happened, so I didn't really have any friends. Kids used to throw stones at the house and call me names. I just kinda retreated into myself. I'd spend whole nights up on the roof, staring at the sky, hoping to catch a glimpse of you again. I always believed that one day you\"\u0098d come back and here you are. The match flame reaches her fingers, she shakes it out. \nTARA Listen to me gabbing. Milk and sugar? \nPAUL I'm so sorry. \nTARA What for? \nPAUL For killing your dog and ruining your life. \nTARA That doesn't matter. Don't you see? You're real. I was right and all those folk that said I was crazy? Well, they can all go fuck themselves. \nPAUL It's good to see you, Tara. The tinkle of glass. Something hits the floor. A tear gas canister spins at their feet, spewing thick fog. \nTARA Now, where do you suppose that came from? \nPAUL Fuck a duck! Get out! \nGRAHAM/CLIVE Shit! \nPAUL Tara, where's the back door? \nTARA In back. The gang bustle out of the room just as the front door splinters inward, revealing O'REILLY in a gas mask. \nINT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY \nTARA My weed! \nEXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY \nZOIL is blackened and dazed, draped over HAGGARD's shoulder. His eyes focus on a figure in the near distance. MOSES BEHE picks himself up and lumbers off towards his truck. HAGGARD drops ZOIL and runs to his car. \nZOIL Damnit Haggard, wait! HAGGARD takes off. ZOIL staggers to his car and with great difficulty, takes off in pursuit, narrowly avoiding MOSES BEHE's truck. Lightening flashes. Loud thunder. \nINT. RV - DAY \nCLIVE floors it. RAIN lashes down. The sky is almost black. \nGRAHAM Your dad's persistent, isn't he? \nRUTH You have no idea. CLIVE sees their pursuers in his wing mirror. \nCLIVE I think we have a problem. \nGRAHAM What do we do? \nPAUL Go left. \nCLIVE What? \nPAUL \nGO LEFT! CLIVE hauls the wheel left. The RV leaves the road and bounces across the scrub. TEAM PAUL hang on for dear life. \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY \nHAGGARD, ZOIL and MOSES follow the RV across the scrub. \nINT. ZOIL'S CAR - EVENING \nZOIL \n(TO HIMSELF) What the hell is he doing?! \nVOICE (O.S.) Zoil. Progress report! \nZOIL Sir, I- \nINT. HAGGARD'S CAR - EVENING \nHAGGARD In pursuit, sir. \nVOICE Who the hell is this? \nHAGGARD Haggard, sir. Agent Zoil has been compromised. I'm assuming command. \nZOIL (O.S.) Now wait a goddamn minute! \nVOICE I don't give a shit who's in command. Where' my fucking mooncoon?! \nHAGGARD Just ahead of me sir. We're heading East across scrubland just North of Mitchell Creek. \nVOICE I don't wanna hear from either of you jokers until that little mother fucker is under glass. \nHAGGARD Yes sir! HAGGARD floors it. He is manic and wild eyed. \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY \nWe see the chase from above, the RV is in the lead, gaining behind them, is HAGGARD, followed by ZOIL, then MOSES. HAGGARD draws level. He looks up into CLIVE's eyes. \nINT. RV - DAY \nCLIVE They're trying to overtake. \nPAUL Don't let him get past. \nCLIVE Shall I ram him? \nRUTH/TARA/GRAHAM/PAUL \nYES! CLIVE wrenches the wheel hard to the left. \nEXT. SCRUB - EVENING \nThe RV nudges the BLACK SEDAN which spins out of control and skids to a stop, ZOIL and MOSES scream past. HAGGARD turns the engine over. Nothing. He yells. Lightening explodes overhead, hail pings and bounces off the hood. \nINT. RV - EVENING \nCLIVE What are we doing exactly? \nHAGGARD (O.S.) You're not running this show any more Zoil. You had your chance. \nZOIL Haggard, he knows what he's doing. \nHAGGARD (O.S.) So do I. \nZOIL It's a trap! \nINT. RV - EVENING \nCLIVE They're still coming! \nRUTH \nWHAT ARE WE DOING TO DO? \nPAUL Ruth, why don't you count back from \nRUTH Okay. 10...9... \nPAUL Back where I'm from, tornadoes are part of our daily life. We've learnt how to live with them, how to understand them. \nCLIVE They're gaining! \nPAUL We've learnt to anticipate their behavior, know their personalities, know when they're playing games. \nRUTH \nGRAHAM What games? \nRUTH \nPAUL Hide and seek? \nRUTH \nCLIVE looks into his wing mirror, just as the tornado snakes down out of the sky between them and HAGGARD. \nCLIVE Great Caesar's ghost! \nRUTH How did you do that? How did you know? \nPAUL Evolution baby. \nEXT. SCRUB - EVENING \nThe tornado touches down hear HAGGARD's car. He barely has time to scream before his is lifted into the vortex. \nINT. MOSES'S PICK UP - EVENING \nA wide eyed MOSES yanks hard on the wheel, spinning the truck round, heading back in the opposite direction. \nEXT. SCRUB - EVENING \nMOSES's truck hurtles past ZOIL's car. \nMOSES BEHE (O.S.) Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! ZOIL looks back toward the no unreachable RV. \nINT. RV - DAY \nCLIVE We've lost them. TEAM PAUL erupt into cheers. PAUL jumps in the air and whoops. He high five GRAHAM and pats CLIVE on the back. GRAHAM embraces RUTH and tries to kiss her, she pulls away. \nGRAHAM Sorry. \nRUTH Wait, what about Papa? \nCLIVE I only saw one car following us. \nPAUL Where's Tara? TARA comes out of the toilet. \nTARA The bulb's gone in there. \nGRAHAM That was just awesome. Amazing driving Clive. It was like G.T.A. but potentially fatal. Wasn't it, Clive? Clive? A knocking and a gurgling sound is coming from the engine. \nCLIVE Oh no. \nEXT. SMALL ROAD - EVENING \nThe RV splutters to a halt. Steam rises from the radiator. It whines, coughs and dies. Cut to TEAM PAUL stood around surveying their fallen companion. A single bullet hold in the grill, reveals the cause of her downfall. \nGRAHAM There goes the deposit. \nCLIVE Fare thee well friend. You were a faithful and mighty steed. \nZOIL \nPAUL! \nPAUL Lorenzo?! PAUL spins round. We go into slow motion. ZOIL fires. The bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes past him, slamming into one of the soldiers. ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward, holding a smoking gun. \nVOICE It was you! You told him. I should've known. \n(MORE) \nVOICE (CONT'D) You've never made a mistake in your life. That's why I put you in charge of this fucking mission. \nZOIL He's my friend! I've known him for twenty years. He introduced me to my wife damnit! \nVOICE You stupid son of a bitch. In five years, you could have been where I am. \nZOIL I don't want to be where you are. \nVOICE Too bad, seeing as I'm the one hold'ng all the cards and when I say \"cards\"\u009d, I of course mean big fucking gun. VOICE points his gun at PAUL. \nPAUL How'd you find me? \nVOICE It was pretty easy once we got a fix on the geek-mobile. Wasn't hard to figure out where you were headed. You always did have a flare for the dramatic. PAUL nods, a sad smile creeping across his mouth. \nVOICE Let's go. TARA stands in front of PAUL, then RUTH, then GRAHAM then CLIVE, who summons every ounce of bravery in his body. \nCLIVE He's not going anywhere. \nVOICE Be honest with yourself, two scoops. What is it that you think you can possibly bring to the table at this stage in the game? CLIVE reaches beyond his back and produces his KATANA SWORD, he holds it like a proud Samurai. \nCLIVE Blind fury. The blade falls off. \nCLIVE Bloody low grade Turkish alloy. \nVOICE Step aside, you fat nerd. \nCLIVE \n(IN KLINGON) Graham, his this man. CLIVE steps aside. GRAHAM slams his fist into the face of the unsuspecting VOICE. He staggers back but rallies quickly, blocking GRAHAM's second blow and delivering a heavy rebuke. RUTH leaps onto VOICE's back and starts pummeling his head. \nRUTH Leave him alone! VOICE hits out at RUTH. GRAHAM renews his attack. \nGRAHAM Leave her alone! VOICE throws them off and comes face to face with TARA. \nTARA Leave them alone. WHAM! She whacks VOICE across the face with a large stick. \nTARA You're not taking him away again. He staggers backwards and falls to the ground, unconscious. \nPAUL Thank you, Tara. \nTARA Don't mention it. PAUL rushes to ZOIL who lies on the ground, wounded. \nZOIL The things I do for you, huh? \nPAUL You know I appreciate it. \nZOIL Do you have any idea how difficult it was to catch you guys? \nPAUL \n(LAUGHS) Let me take a look at that. Ruth, shine the torch down here? RUTH grabs a torch and steps in behind PAUL. \nBLAM! RUTH lurches forward, suddenly limp. Everyone turns to see MOSES BEHE, shotgun smoking in his and. His face white, his eyes wide. \nMOSES BEHE Oh Lord, Ruth. My little Ruth. \nGRAHAM Noooooooooo! GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of blood around her mouth. \nMOSES BEHE I...I never meant to shoot her. I was aiming for the goblin. \nCLIVE He's not a goblin he's from another planet. \nMOSES BEHE But he can't be. He... he... \nGRAHAM He's an alien you stupid man! Oh Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I should have never persuaded you to come with us. RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly. \nRUTH What, and miss all this? Graham, I've lived more in the last 48 hours that I ever did in that trailer park. Isn't that what you said living was all about? Right now? This conversation? That tree? My next cheeseburger? I'm not afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold though. Hey, where is everybody? RUTH shudders and dies. TARA and ZOIL look aghast. GRAHAM buries his head in RUTH's hair. CLIVE, his eyes are filled with tears, puts his and on GRAHAM's shoulder. \nMOSES BEHE What have I done? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. A shadow is cast across RUTH. Everyone looks up to see PAUL, silhouetted against the moon. His eyes glint. \nPAUL There is no way this thing isn't gonna end happy. \nPAUL drops to his knee and places his hands on RUTH's chest. MOSES drops his shotgun and lumbers over, distraught. \n", "test1_input": "PAUL \nWritten by \nSimon Pegg & Nick Frost \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT \nCaption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming 10:19pm 28/07/47 \nThe air is filled with the sounds of a warm, summer night. A light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window. The door opens, a small dog and a young girl emerge. \nGIRL Go on now Paul, don't be long. \nThe dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch. The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground, bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness. \nGIRL Paul...

PRESENT - DAY \nGRAHAM WILLY (32) and CLIVE GOLLINGS (33) stand in the blazing San Diego sunshine, waiting to cross the road. GRAHAM is thin but his clothes seem too small. He has long greasy hair, buck teeth and thick glasses. CLIVE is bigger and wears a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots. His hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid. Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by. GRAHAM and CLIVE shrug derisively. The cross-walk beeps. As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the road towards the San Diego Convention Centre. They make their way through a throng of costumed Comic-Con attendees. \nINT. CONVENTION CENTRE. CONVENTION FLOOR - LATER \nGRAHAM and CLIVE are at a fantasy weapons stand. CLIVE is brandishing a KATANA SWORD. He test the balance, the weight, the sharpness. He closes one eye and looks down the length of the blade. He nods appreciatively. \nCLIVE Beautiful piece. \nVENDER Damn straight. Practical performance. 100% Japanese, folded steel. Real hero shit. \nCLIVE How much? \nVENDER \nCLIVE nods, puts the sword down and walks away. \nGRAHAM Aren't you gonna get it? \nCLIVE No, it's rubbish. \nINT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY \nWe see them on an escalator, walking down a wide corridor, passing people in a variety of costumes. Finally, they join a line of people waiting to meet the actor, MICHAEL BIEHN. \nGRAHAM What are you going to ask? \nCLIVE Do you feel that the killing of Hicks and Newt in Alien 3, invalidates Ripley's struggle at the closed of the previous installment? \nGRAHAM I was going to ask that! \nCLIVE \n(IN KLINGON) Tough tits four eyes. \nSECURITY Alright, next! Suddenly nervous, GRAHAM approaches. MICHAEL BIEHN is signing pictures. He is pleasant, if business like. \nMICHAEL BIEHN Hey there. Who's it to? \nGRAHAM Graham. \nMICHAEL BIEHN Graham. \nGRAHAM Uh... are you... did you? \nMICHAEL BIEHN There you go. SECURITY moves GRAHAM on. CLIVE approaches. \nMICHAEL BIEHN Hey there. Who's it to? \nCLIVE Clive. \nMICHAEL BIEHN Clive. \nCLIVE Uh... are you... did you? \nMICHAEL BIEHN There you go. SECURITY moves CLIVE on. CLIVE scrambles for his camera. \nCLIVE I... I need to photograph him. \nSECURITY You can take it from there. CLIVE and GRAHAM huddle together and try to position themselves with MICHAEL BIEHN in the background. CLIVE takes the shot. We see a frozen image of CLIVE and GRAHAM, with MICHAEL BIEHN barely visible in the background. The pair move off, looking at their spoils. \n", "test1_true": "(HIGH FIVING) \nYES! \nGRAHAM That was amazing. I was actually a bit nervous. \nCLIVE Really? I wasn't. \nGRAHAM Good egg, wasn't he? \nCLIVE Yes, very unaffected. Damn, I forgot to give him my card. CLIVE points at SECURITY. \nGRAHAM Give it to Colossus. \nCLIVE Nah. Hey, Rosario Dawson's here! \nGRAHAM She NEEDS to call me. \nINT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER \nGRAHAM and CLIVE sit at a table fiddling nervously with pens. On either side of them are stacks of their new book; JELVA - ALIEN QUEEN OF THE VARVAK. A banner hangs behind, displaying the tome's cover, a muscular green woman in a gold bikini rides a blue rhino. She lashes at the beast with a laser whip. She has three tits. A lanky publicist paces up and down, making sure everything is in order. \nPUBLICIST Looks good, right? \nCLIVE Yes, it's very impressive. \nPUBLICIST It really does the image justice. I never noticed the third tit. \nCLIVE That was Graham's idea. \nPUBLICIST Ladies man, huh? You guys happy? You got enough pens? You wanna Snapple? You wanna a Diet Coke? \nCLIVE I'll have a fat Coke please? \nPUBLICIST A fat what? \nCLIVE Coke. \nPUBLICIST Oh you man a FAT Coke. \nCLIVE A what? \nPUBLICIST Fat coke. \nCLIVE Yes please. \nGRAHAM When do we start? \nPUBLICIST Ten minutes ago. \nCLIVE Why is it so quiet? \nPUBLICIST Sylar's doing a Q and A in the main pavillion. \nCLIVE Oh man! I wanted to go to that . I wanted to find out if he actually eats the brains. \nPUBLICIST I can make a call. \nCLIVE Please. \nPUBLICIST It'll pick up when he's done. \nGRAHAM I'm nervous. \nCLIVE Don't be. The hard work's done, we have a great story and as usual your renderings jump from the page. \nPUBLICIST Yeah man. Three tits. Awesome. \nGRAHAM Thank you. \nCLIVE All we have to do now is sit back and enjoy. A child approaches. \nCLIVE Queen Jelva welcomes thee. \nCHILD Do you know where Sylar's on? \nCLIVE Main pavillion. \nCHILD Thanks. Hey, three tits. Awesome. \nINT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER \n", "test1_id": 204, "test2_input": "CLIVE \n(TO GRAHAM) How come you know so much? \nGRAHAM We had quite a long chat while you were unconscious. CLIVE looks miffed. \nGRAHAM ...while you were asleep. \nPAUL You want a bagel Clive? \nCLIVE No thanks. \nPAUL Graham? \nGRAHAM Yes please. \nCLIVE Go on then, I'll have half. \nPAUL (O.S.) You want anything on it? \nCLIVE Jam. \nPAUL (O.S.) What? \nCLIVE Jelly. \nPAUL Gotcha. PAUL heads to the kitchen. The boys drive in silence. \nGRAHAM I gave your jeans a swill and hung them up. \nCLIVE Thank you. So, do you know where we're going? \nGRAHAM Just North. He said we had to make a right at Utah. \nCLIVE Why can't he tell us? \nGRAHAM He said it was a surprise. \nCLIVE Do you trust him, Graham? I mean, is he Strider or Black Rider? \nGRAHAM Strider, definitely. \nCLIVE You'd better be right. I don't want to wake up and find him inserting a probe into my anus. \nGRAHAM It's okay, he doesn't do that. PAUL returns with three bagels on one long finger. \nPAUL Bagel time! The dashboard beeps. PAUL jumps throwing them into the air. \nGRAHAM Fuel level's critical. \nPAUL Sorry, I had a warning light just like that on my ship. \nGRAHAM For fuel? \nPAUL Anti-grav failure. CLIVE is looking at the sat-nav on the computer. \nCLIVE There's a place called Ely five miles from here. It's small but there should be a gas station. \nGRAHAM Roger that, number one. \nCLIVE smiles at GRAHAM and flashes PAUL a triumphant look. PAUL coughs loudly, barely disguising the word \"Geeks\"\u009d. \nINT. RV - MORNING \nGRAHAM and CLIVE peer out at the gas station. It appears deserted. PAUL has his head in the fridge, he cracks open a V8, strolls to the front of the RV and honks the horn. An OLD MAN peers out of the gas station window and waves. \nCLIVE Paul, don't do that! \nPAUL Here's what I need. Some organic beef mince, organic pork, some veal, red onions, pine nuts, pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a fistful of fresh basil and 3 war ciabattas. \nCLIVE You know this is a gas station? PAUL looks disappointed. \nEXT. GAS STATION - DAY \nThe door to the RV opens, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out onto the forecourt, trying to look as casual as they can. \nCLIVE Ready? \nGRAHAM Ready. HOOOONNNNNKKKK! GRAHAM and CLIVE jump. \nPAUL (O.S.) Get me some more peanut M&Ms. GRAHAM goes into the store, CLIVE to the pumps. A POLICE CRUISER pulls onto the forecourt. CLIVE goes pale and fumbles the nozzle back into the pump. He walks toward the checkout as a STATE TROOPER exits his car. No matter how hard he tries, CLIVE cannot avoid reaching the door at the same time as the STATE TROOPER. He is tall, wide and bald. \nSTATE TROOPER After you. \n", "test2_true": "EXT. DESERT ROAD - MORNING \nClose up on O'REILLY. He covers his face with his hands. \nO'REILLY Coming... ready or not! O'REILLY uncovers his eyes and comes face to face with ZOIL. ZOIL is eating an orange, he offers a segment to O'REILLY. \nZOIL Orange? \nO'REILLY No thanks. \nZOIL Nice and juicy. \nO'REILLY I don't want to spoil breakfast. \nZOIL Do you mind telling me what's going on, Agent? \nO'REILLY Just keeping ourselves occupied sir. Things are pretty slow. \nZOIL Where's the other one? \nO'REILLY I don't know, let's see. Haggard? HAGGARD steps out from behind the only man shaped cactus on the entire desert plain. O'REILLY can't help but let out a snort of delighted surprise. HAGGARD hurries over. \nHAGGARD Sorry, I was just... hiding. \nZOIL I see. You fellas had much traffic through here? \nHAGGARD Just a big RV driven by a couple of nerds. \nZOIL Nerds, huh? \nHAGGARD Yeah, they'd been to Comic-Con and met Michael Biehn. \nZOIL I've heard he's nice. \nHAGGARD Good egg. \nO'REILLY Very unaffected. \nZOIL Did you search the vehicle thoroughly? \nO'REILLY Yes sir. \nZOIL Find anything? \nO'REILLY Not really. Just Michael Biehn's autograph and some pissy jeans. Close in on ZOIL. He seems suddenly motivated. \nZOIL Did you get the license plate? HAGGARD and O'REILLY look sheepish. \nZOIL Make? More sheepishness. \nHAGGARD It was big. \nZOIL I want everything you can remember. Descriptions of the occupants, height, hair, distinguishing features. We can do it on the way. \nHAGGARD On the way? \nZOIL You're coming with me. \nO'REILLY What about the road block sir? \nZOIL It didn't work. \nINT. GAS STATION - MORNING \nGRAHAM joins CLIVE at the check out, clutching a bag of jerky, a bottle of chocolate milk, a burrito, a Coke, some mini doughnuts and a massive bag of peanut M&Ms. \nCLIVE Don't you think that's a bit much? Put it all back. Except the burrito... and the doughnuts... and the chocolate milk. Let's just pay for it and leave. \nGRAHAM We need bulb for the toilet. \nCLIVE Essential only, Graham! They head to the counter. So does the STATE TROOPER. \nSTATE TROOPER Morning Chris! \nCHRIS Hey Dean. \nSTATE TROOPER Who do you think I had in my office this morning? \nCHRIS Jeremy Piven? \nSTATE TROOPER No. The Secret Service. GRAHAM bumps into a display of sunglasses and just stops it tumbling. CHRIS and the STATE TROOPER glance over. \n", "test2_id": 205, "test3_input": "INT. HIGHWAY. ROADSIDE - NIGHT \nZOIL talks on a satellite phone. HAGGARD works on a laptop nearby. O'REILLY listens in. \nZOIL Where are you? Where are you headed? \nRUTH (O.S.) I don't know. \nZOIL Look, I know you think you're doing the right thing but I promise you, I'm only thinking about you. And Paul. You care about Paul, don't you? \nRUTH (O.S.) I don't know how I feel about him. He's weird and also, rude. \nZOIL Yes he is. \nRUTH (O.S.) I asked him why he wore shorts and he said if he didn't I'd see his big spaceman balls. \nINT. BAR. PAY PHONE - NIGHT \nLoud giggles, followed by angry shushing from ZOIL. \nRUTH Who's there with you? \nZOIL (O.S.) Ruth, please listen to me. Your father is worried about you. We want to get you home. I need you to tell me where you are. \nRUTH He showed me things. \nZOIL You're not still talking about his balls, are you? \nRUTH I... i just want to know what's real. I'm confused. I... I... RUTH struggles. Her expression shows great conflict. \nHAGGARD (O.S.) \nWE GOT HER! \nZOIL (O.S.) Damnit, Haggard! RUTH panics and slams down the phone. She realizes what she may have done and rushes back toward the bar, slamming into two men. The MEATHEADS, drunk, look down at her, amused. \nJAKE Hey, slow down there cyclops. \nRUTH I need to get to my friends. \nGUS Why the hurry? You know I got a friend with one eye who'd love to meet you. \nRUTH I happen to have two eyes actually. I just have a severe stigmatism. \nJAKE You should get that fixed up. Reckon you'd be kinda pretty in the right light. \nGUS Yeah, the dark. \nRUTH Papa said the Lord would fix it. \nGUS The Lord ain't gonna fix nothing sweetheart. \nRUTH No shit. RUTH plants her knee firmly into the groin of GUS. He doubles up knocking his friend over. RUTH bolts. \nINT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER \nGRAHAM and CLIVE are clutching brown paper bags full of food, RUTH returns from the Phone. \nGRAHAM How's your dad? \nRUTH We need to leave now. \nCLIVE We're still waiting on a wet fries. The two MEATHEADS emerge from the pay phone. Angry. \nJAKE Holy shit! It's the space faggots that dinged the fuck-mobile! \nCLIVE Look, I'm terribly sorry. Perhaps we can exchange insurance details? \nJAKE I'm sorry I don't speak \"\u0098nerd'. GRAHAM and CLIVE look terribly offended. \nGUS These the \"\u0098friends' you told us about, baby? \nRUTH Yes, they are. \nJAKE Well whaddya know? Small world. \nRUTH We were just leaving. \nGUS I don't think so. \nJAKE grabs RUTH. GRAHAM pushes him hard in the chest. \nGRAHAM Leave her alone! \n", "test3_true": "CLIVE (timid but resolute) He said, leave her alone. At this, JAKE pulls his fist back to hit CLIVE, knocking a tray of drinks all over a table full of men. They immediately spring up and lunge after the MEATHEADS who turn their attention to the attack. The fight spreads like fire. GRAHAM grabs RUTH's hand and follows CLIVE as he scrambles through the fracas. As they reach the door RUTH is yanked back and comes face to face with her father. \nMOSES BEHE \nRUTH?! \nRUTH \nPAPA?! \nCLIVE Graham? \nMOSES BEHE I'm taking you home. \nRUTH I... I can't. \nMOSES BEHE Don't talk back to me, girl! \nRUTH \nPAPA I- A chair smashes across MOSES's head, knocking him out. Behind him, bloodied and angry are the two MEATHEADS. \nEXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nCLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH explode out of the bar and run toward the RV. The MEATHEADS crash out after them. \nRUTH What about Papa?! \nJAKE Hey, we ain't finished with you. \nCLIVE Graham, take Ruth into the RV and lock the door. I don't want either of you to see this. CLIVE turns back to the MEATHEADS. BANG! CLIVE is struck in the face, he falls, nose bleeding. They turn to RUTH and GRAHAM, who back up against the RV. The MEATHEADS approach ominously. The RV door bursts open. PAUL stands silhouetted against the interior lights. \nPAUL Yo fucknuts! The MEATHEADS freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears a few feet from them, their eyes bulge. \nPAUL So, who wants to get probed first? The MEATHEADS swoon and simultaneously hit the deck. \nGRAHAM Ha! Only one of us fainted! \nPAUL Tell me you got the food? CLIVE gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food. Sirens wail in distance. RUTH turns white. \nRUTH It's them. \nGRAHAM Who? \nRUTH It wasn't my fault. They answered the phone. He knew all about us. \nCLIVE Who? Who are you talking about? \nPAUL Get in the RV! SMASH CUT. The RV roars to life, backing up at speed into the MEATHEAD's vehicle. MOSES BEHE bursts out of the bar, just as the RV passes. RUTH sees him out of the window. MOSES locks eye with his daughter. He runs to his pick up but realises he doesn't have his keys. The RV tears off into the night, leaving MOSES BEHE bellowing with anger and the Lincoln Escalade, shiny, mean, fucked. \nINT. RV - NIGHT \nThe RV pulls off the road into a secluded lay-by. The gang sit in silence for a while. \nGRAHAM Was that your dad, Ruth? RUTH nods. \nCLIVE He was so angry. \nRUTH He's always angry. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL all exchange looks. \nGRAHAM Are you alright, Ruth? RUTH nods, still distant. \nPAUL I'm feeling pretty amped up. Anyone wanna take a walk? \nCLIVE I'm game. \nGRAHAM You want to come for a walk, Ruth? \nRUTH Thanks, but I think I'm going to turn in. It's been a long day what with meeting you guys, being abducted by and alien and having my whole belief system called into question. \nPAUL Sorry about that. \nGRAHAM It was amazing though, wasn't it? Remember when Paul said \"\u0098Yo fucknuts'? That was brilliant. \nPAUL You gotta talk the talk, right? \nCLIVE What about when I got smacked in the nose? \nPAUL Yeah yeah Snorlax, you're a real hero. Come on. Let's skedaddle. You want anything Ruth? \nRUTH No, you go, I'll be fine. Here Clive. RUTH hands CLIVE her handkerchief. It is embroidered with the words \"\u0098JESUS SAVES'. \n", "test3_id": 206}

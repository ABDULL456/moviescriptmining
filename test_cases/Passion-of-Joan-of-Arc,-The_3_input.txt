Why are you wearing men's clothes? 
Joan refuses several times to answer and remains sitting motionless, stiff as a ramrod. The judge says: 
Are you willing to wear a woman's dress? 
30   Massieu leans towards her and advises her to accept this suggestion, which he thinks must be very easy for her to do. But Joan looks at him with the air of one treasuring a great secret, and says no to the judge. When the judge presses her to tell him why she refuses, she answers: 
When I have completed the task which God has entrusted to me, then I will wear women's clothes again. 
Whispering among the judges - 
31   An indication that another trap is being prepared. Then one of the judges says: 
So it is God who has commanded you to go about in men's clothes? 
Joan answers unhesitatingly: 
Yes! 
A smile of triumph spreads from face to face among Joan's judges. 
32   The Promoter, Jean d'Estivet, complacently makes some notes. Then he leans forward over his desk, smiles and asks in an insincere tone of voice: 
And what reward do you hope to obtain from the Lord? 
33   Joan, whose expression is that of a saint, folds her hands on her breast and raises her eyes to heaven: 
The salvation of my soul!

CUT TO: 
INT. POOL HALL -- MORNING 
Dupree chalks his cue, positions for a shot. 
DUPREE No? (off dull stares from Deeks and Elmore) Then you've both been living under the same rock, 'cuz these cocksuckers are infamous. Three brothers, same skank mom, different deadbeat dads, used for that suicide-kamikaze style shit. You heard about that huge shoot- out in Cleveland? 
DEEKS Is that the club that got wiped out a couple months back? 
ELMORE What happened? 
DUPREE The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. DINNER CLUB -- NIGHT 
THE TREMOR BROTHERS pilot a Dodge Barracuda right through the front window with wrecking ball bravado. Bodies scatter as the Tremors deploy from the car in full body kevlar, doing doomsday on the club. One of them fires up a chainsaw, chewing into the panicked crowd. Bodyguards blast back, but bullets play like spitballs against the Tremor's body armor. 
DUPREE (V.O.) Donald McGarey, the local union rep, is the mark. The Tremors go ripshit riot on the whole club, seven people dead, twenty-eight wounded. Just to get to this one guy. 
Shotguns roar-- blast spreads obliterate-- a shitstorm of blood, spilled booze and busted glass-- 
DUPREE (CONT'D) --And they get it about as good as they give it. In the melee, one of the brothers catches blowback from a jammed piece and is temporarily blinded, the other takes bullets to the lower back and can't walk. The third gets popped in the neck and passes out. McGarey gets out of the club alive...and not much further... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DINNER CLUB -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT 
The blind Tremor, walking wounded, piggybacking his brother with the bum back, dragging the other by the scruff of his neck, unconscious across the concrete. Police sirens squeal. McGarey, the union guy, hairpiece hanging by a thread, crawling toward his car. The piggyback Tremor brother reaches into his blind brother's coat, grabs a revolver and unloads. 
Long live the teamsters...Not tonight. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. POOL HALL 
Dupree chalks his cue. 
DUPREE They're speed freaks, neo-nazi's. Sworn to the swastika, supposedly read and recite "Mein Kampf" like Mother Goose...And these motherfuckers can go megaton at the drop of a hat. 
SYKES (V.O.) What's the name again? 
INT. DINER -- NIGHT 
Wyman, Sykes and Watters, back at the greasy spoon. 
WYMAN "Soot, Lazlo Soot." Lotta folks want this white boy clapped. Soot could be workin' for one 'em. 
EXT. STREET -- DAY 
Crammed pedestrian crossing, noon hour a trio of SUITS converse, shrouded by bodyguards. 
WYMAN (V.O.) Nobody really certain where he come from... 
The party proceeds through the crosswalk, approaching them is a dark-suited man, expressionless, hands in his pockets. Others move past; a woman with shopping bags, a skateboard punk, a geriatric dog-walker and a man, full paralysis, mouth- op wheelchair, "My Left Foot" palsy. 
WYMAN (CONT'D) ...and when he moves on somebody, they the last ones t'see it comin'-- 
The bodyguards perk up, sensing something. Dark-Suit, removing his hands from his pockets-- cellphone...Wrong guy. 
The crippled cat, throwing a quilt off his lap, contorted face vanishing, two Uzi machine-pistols up, safeties off, triggers pulled-- BAP! BAP! BAP! BAP! BAP! BAP! 
The bodyguards get caught napping-- bullets blaze point blank. The three suits collapse. The phony invalid empties both guns, hops up from the wheelchair, hooks a passing truck and flees the scene...that, was LAZLO SOOT. 
DUPREE (V.O.) So what do you think? 
INT. POOL HALL -- BAR 
The boys have retired to the bar for a round of dollar drafts. 
ELMORE I think it's idiotic to continue this conversation. (turns, to Deeks) We're ex-cops which means we weren't great cops or even good ones. 
DEEKS Paying bills with bullshit casino jobs, sitting watch on slot machines. 
ELMORE Which was a great gig until we we walked in here and started drinking. 
DUPREE The bond on Israel expires in eighteen hours, after that, it's a jump ball. Our window is now. 
DEEKS Who posted his bail? 
Dupree pats himself down, searching for his cigs. 
DUPREE His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since. 
ELMORE Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.

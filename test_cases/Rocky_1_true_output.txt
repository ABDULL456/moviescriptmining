ROCKY Ain't your fault - Here's the problem. 
Adrian nods... Though charmed, she is slightly intimidated. 
ROCKY The last food I got here had more moths than flies -- An' the moths get caught in my turtle's throat -- That makes them cough -- 
The OWNER, a squat woman of forty, steps out of the back and waves at Rocky. 
ROCKY (continuing) Yo, Gloria -- I was talkin' about the turtle food -- Like I was sayin', the moths get caught in the turtle's throat an' makes 'em cough... (coughs) A little cough an' I gotta smack 'em on the shell -- An' whatta think they get? 
Adrian shrugs. 
ROCKY (continuing) I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What? 
ADRIAN ... I don't know. 
ROCKY Shell-shocked! 
Both the Owner and Adrian smile. 
OWNER Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh. 
ROCKY Inventin' jokes ain't easy. 
Rocky steps over to a large cage at the rear of the shop... Inside is a huge dog. 
ROCKY (continuing) How's Butkus this mornin'? 
OWNER Ain't had time to check 'em. 
Rocky opens the cage and the large dog jumps out and looks very happy. 
ROCKY Yo, Butkus -- Dead.  Play dead. 
The dog plays dead. 
ROCKY ...What kinda dog is this again? 
OWNER Bullmastiff. 
ROCKY The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago. 
OWNER We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days - We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know. ...Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. (Adrian nods.) 
Rocky waves goodbye to Adrian and exits the shop. 
EXT. LEHIGH ST. TRAIN TRESTLE - DAY 
Gazzo picks up Rocky. 
INT. GAZZO'S CAR - MOVING - DAY 
MR. GAZZO and his YOUNG BODY GUARD sit in the front seat... Rocky is in the back seat. 
ROCKY He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo. 
GAZZO (patiently) Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it... 
Gazzo hands Rocky a twenty. 
GAZZO Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night? 
ROCKY ... Fine. 
Gazzo's Bodyguard looks at Rocky's bruised face in the mirror and smiles. 
BODYGUARD Did ya get the license number? 
ROCKY Of wa? 
BODYGUARD ... Of the truck that run over your face. 
Gazzo steps out of the car and beckons to Rocky. 
GAZZO Yo Rock.  Did I give you a job this mornin?  How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya?  When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid. 
ROCKY I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin no more.

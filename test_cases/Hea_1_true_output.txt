takes the girl and folds her into his bear-like chest. He carries her off. He holds onto her and wraps his jacket around her. Tears stream down his face.

is unconscious on the table. BOB, a veterinarian of 55 in a white coat and bald head, works on him. DOGS BARK O.S. from the kennels. 
A CLAMP CLATTERS into the bowl. Chris moans in a dry rasp and convulses. Bob motions to Neil to hold Chris' shoulders. 
NEIL 
holds Chris down. 
BOB (O.S.) Bottom tray. 
With one hand Neil gives Bob a tray of syringes. 
WIDE - THE SURGERY 
Bob's back obscures a series of injections into Chris' neck and shoulder. 
It's a veterinarian surgery and the metal table Chris is an is for holding down dogs. Long leather straps aren't buckled. There's pictures of cocker spaniels on the walls. Spent syringes CLATTER into pans.

INT. DR. BOB'S OFFICE - DR. BOB - DAY 
washes his hands in the sink. Neil sits on his desk.     A tv plays news footage from Bosnia. 
DOC Blood loss and shock and he'll have a lot of pain in the shoulder and back, but I'll give you quarter-grain phials of morphine. Subcutaneous injections. 
NEIL (nods) What's the bottom line? 
DR. BOB Missed the carotid artery by millimeters. There is mostly tissue damage. And the collar a bone's smashed. Can he rest awhile? 
NEIL Six, seven hours.   What do I owe you? 
News coverage switches to scenes from the robbery with the commentator in a window. 
DR. BOB It's got to be twenty thou. 
NEIL What is this? 
DR. BOB You're number one with a bullet on the six o'clock news. It's at least double the risk. So I'm doubling my price. 
Neil opens a shopping bag and stacks packets of bills. News coverage switches to sports and weather. 
NEIL You're wrong. It's four times the risk. 'Cause something happens to him, I'm coming back for you. And I'm double the worst trouble you ever had. 
Bob looks at Neil's eyes and believes it.

on his stomach, breathing heavily. 
NEIL I'll be back for you. 
CHRIS (a little dazed; rasp) Charlene? Get her out! 
NEIL First, I got to know if our escape route got ratted-out along with everything else. 
CHRIS (rasps) Who... 
NEIL Who wasn't around Towner. 
Chris hacks, coughs; Neil helps him spit into a steel pan.

It's the taped-off crime scene where Michael Cerrito dropped. News media are all over. Spectators mill. Emergency vehicles FLASHERS spin. Motorcycle cops re-route traffic. 
ANGLE 
The battered Mercury wagon is still in situ, being dusted by two TECHNICIANS for prints. We HEAR a car pull in o.S. and. 
ELAINE (O.S.) (screaming; shouting) Get out of my way! (shrieks; sobs) Michael. Michael. Michael. Michael!!! 
ELAINE CERRITO 
knocks over a Uniformed Cop and runs down the sidewalk to the chalked outline of Cerrito's body on the cement and lawn.

CLOSER 
Another cop moves to stop her. She dodges him. Disheveled, screaming, hysterical - she throws herself on the bloodied ground Michael Cerrito died upon and clutches at the outline drawing of his body and blood stains as if it were him. 
NEWS CAMERAMAN 
with lights moves in and tapes her. A Police woman tries to help Elaine up. Elaine bats her away.

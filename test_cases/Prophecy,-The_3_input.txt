The second deputy has walked over to Gabriel. 
DEPUTY Is he alive? 
DEPUTY #2 He's alive. 
DEPUTY Cuff him. We'll take him to the hospital in our car. 
DAGGETT -- No, you don't understand. You have to let me have him -- 
The volunteer fire engine growls up through the weeds, drowning out Thomas's words. Two firemen kneel down beside him with medical kits. 
The deputy has walked over to his partner and the two are dragging back between them a cuffed, comatose Gabriel. 
DAGGETT (hoarse, faint) You'll never hold him. 
Thomas tries to get up, but the pain and a hand from the firemen keep him down. As the deputies pass, he manages to desperately grab the one's pant cuff. 
DAGGETT Take off his sunglasses... Jesus Christ, just take off his sunglasses... 
Gabriel's head lies low between the shoulders. The deputy looks with concern at the firemen. 
FIREMAN (re Thomas) He'll be all right. Just a bad hit. 
The deputy nods. As they carry on to the car with Gabriel, the angel turns his head slightly and smiles a smile only for Thomas. 
FIREMAN (to partner) Let's get a splint. 
The patrol car pulls away. As the firemen walk back to their engine, Thomas looks frantically at Katherine. 
DAGGETT We have to get out of here. 
KATHERINE But your head... 
DAGGETT If you want Mary to stay alive past sundown we have to leave, and we have to do it now. 
They lock eyes. Then Katherine without a word helps Thomas up into the passenger side of the pickup. Mary gathers her grandmother into the pickup's bed and climbs up beside her as Katherine starts the engine. The firemen turn in confusion as the truck peels out of the lot and up onto the road. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
Katherine's truck shoots by. Just before town, near the copper mine, it slows down at a junction. 
And there, lying on its side down the embankment, is the sheriff's patrol car. A single, bent tire turns aimlessly. 
Katherine hits the gas and takes the junction that leads away from town, out onto the endless expanse of the plateau. 
INT. TRUCK 
The bandage on Thomas's forehead covers most of one eye. He closes the other tightly, riding a spasm of pain, before letting his forehead rest against the door glass and gazing out at the empty tracks of land. 
DAGGETT Where are we going? 
KATHERINE Mary's village. 
Katherine looks over her shoulder to Mary's grandmother sitting in the truck bed. She nods in understanding. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Katherine's pickup passing alone through the wrinkled desert. 
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 
A trading post with a few pumps, growing orange in the weakening afternoon light. A scruffy dog barks constantly as the teenage Indian sticks the nozzle in Katherine's pickup. Still glassy-eyed with throbbing pain, Thomas takes another handful of aspirin and climbs out of the cab. 
There's a tiny, weatherbeaten church across the weedy lot from the trading post with a pay phone bolted to it. Thomas crunches across the lot, picks up the receiver, and punches in some numbers. 
TELEPHONE VOICE County Coroner's office, Assistant Coroner Raphael speaking. 
DAGGETT Willie? 
VOICE Tom? 
DAGGETT You weren't crazy, man. 
And Thomas hangs up. He backs away from the phone and for the first time notices the church it's attached to. 
INT. CHURCH 
Thomas steps inside. It's empty and there's some doubt whether it's been used in a generation. The pews are dusty and scraped, some broken down completely. Thomas sits in one and looks across the space and dust and years to the crucifix hanging behind the altar. 
DAGGETT So what's the deal, huh? 
The pew creaks and groans as he shifts his weight. 
DAGGETT I mean, do you have any kind of plan here? Cause I'm just about of ideas, friend.

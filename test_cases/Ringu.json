Sunday.\u0094 \nINT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD \u0096 TOMOKO\u0092S ROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSEUP on a TELEVISION SET.  There\u0092s a baseball game on, but the sound is turned completely down.  Camera PANS to show two cute high school girls, MASAMI and TOMOKO.  Masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee table, TEXTBOOK in front of her. Tomoko is at her desk.  There are SNACKS all over the room, and it\u0092s obvious there hasn\u0092t been much studying going on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly. \nMASAMI They say that some elementary school kid spent the night with his parents at a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid wanted to go out and play with everybody, right, but he didn\u0092t want to miss the program he always used to watch back in Tokyo, so he records it on the VCR in their room.  But of course the stations in Izu are different from the ones in Tokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty channel, so he should\u0092ve recorded nothing but static.  But when the kid gets back to his house and watches the tape, all of a sudden this woman comes on the screen and says-- \nMasami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko actually jumps in her seat. \nMASAMI (cont\u0092d) \u0093One week from now, you will die.\u0094 \nShort silence as Masami pauses, relishing the moment. \nMASAMI (cont\u0092d) Of course the kid\u0092s completely freaked, and he stops the video. Just then the phone rings, and when he picks it up a voice says-- \nHer voice drops voice almost to a whisper. \nMASAMI (cont\u0092d) \u0093You watched it, didn\u0092t you?\u0094  That same time, exactly one week later... he\u0092s dead! \nMasami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance. Tomoko, however, is completely silent.  She begins looking more and more distressed, until finally Masami notices. \nMASAMI What is it, Tomoko? \nTomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her friend.  Her words are quick, earnest. \nTOMOKO Who did you hear that story from? \nMASAMI Who?  It\u0092s just a rumor.  Everybody knows it. \nTOMOKO Youko told you? \nMASAMI No, it wasn\u0092t Youko... \nTomoko looks away, worried.  Masami slaps her on the knee, laughing. \nTomoko nods, uh-huh.  Masami dives forward, pinching her friend\u0092s cheeks and grinning wildly. \nMASAMI So, how far did you and he get? \nTOMOKO Oh... I can\u0092t remember. \nMASAMI You can\u0092t remember, huh? \nMasami laughs, then slaps Tomoko on the knee again as she remembers the trick her friend played on her. \nMASAMI Man, you had me freaked me out. I-- \nJust at that moment, the phone RINGS.  They are both suddenly, instantly serious.  Tomoko\u0092s eyes go off in one direction and she begins shaking her head, -No-.  Masami looks over her shoulder, following her friend\u0092s gaze. \nTomoko is looking at the CLOCK, which currently reads 9:40. \nThe phone continues to ring.  Tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her friend, looking panicked. \nMASAMI (softly) Was it true? \nTomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly.  Masami has to forcibly disengage herself in order to stand.  The phone is downstairs, so Masami opens the bedroom DOOR and races down the STAIRS.  Tomoko calls out to her from behind. \nTOMOKO Masami! \nINT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD \u0096 STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nTomoko and Masami run down the staircase, through the hallway towards the kitchen.  Tomoko cries out again just before they reach the kitchen. \nTOMOKO Masami! \nINT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD \u0096 KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMasami has come to a halt before a PHONE mounted on the wall.  She pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone.  She takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly.  The tension continues to mount as nothing is said. Masami suddenly breaks into a huge grin. \nMASAMI I\u0092ll put her on. \nStill grinning, she hands the phone to Tomoko.  Tomoko snatches it quickly. \nTOMOKO (softly) Yes? \nShe is silent for a moment, then smiling widely. \nTOMOKO Oh, man! \nShe is so relieved that all the strength seeps out of her and she sinks to the kitchen floor.  Masami, equally relieved, slides down the wall and sits down next to her. \nTOMOKO (on the phone) Yeah, I\u0092ve got a friend over now. Yeah.  Yeah, OK.  Bye. \nTomoko stands to place the phone back in its wall cradle, and then squats back down onto the kitchen floor. \nYOUNG GIRL Sorry. \nASAKAWA Let\u0092s do it again. \nAsakawa glances over her shoulder, makes sure that Komiya is ready. \nASAKAWA Have you heard what kind of video it might be? \nYOUNG GIRL What I heard was, all of a sudden this scaaarry lady comes on the screen and says, \u0093In one week, you will die.\u0094 \nGIRL #2 I heard that if you\u0092re watching TV late at night it\u0092ll come on, and then your phone\u0092ll ring. \nASAKAWA Watching TV late at night... do you know what station? \nGIRL #2 Mmmm... I heard some local station, around Izu. \nASAKAWA Izu? \nGIRL #2 Mmm-hmm. \nASAKAWA And, do you know if anyone\u0092s really died from watching it? \nThe girl flashes a look at her two friends. \nYOUNG GIRL Well, no one that we know, right? \nGirl #2 nods her head. Girl #3 nods slowly, opens and closes her mouth as if deciding whether to say something or not.  The reporter notices. \nASAKAWA What is it? \nGIRL #3 I heard this from a friend of mine in high school.  She said that there was this one girl who watched the video, and then died a week later. She was out on a drive with her boyfriend. \nASAKAWA They were in a wreck? \nGIRL #3 No, their car was parked, but they were both dead inside.  Her boyfriend died because he\u0092d watched the video, too.  That\u0092s what my friend said. \nGirl #3 grows suddenly defensive. \nGIRL #3 (cont\u0092d) It\u0092s true!  It was in the paper two or three days ago. \nASAKAWA Do you know the name of the high school this girl went to? \nGIRL #3 No... I heard this from my friend, and it didn\u0092t happen at her school. She heard it from a friend at a different school, she said. \nINT. NEWS STATION \u0096 DAY \nAsakawa is seated at her DESK.  The station is filled with PEOPLE, scrabbling to meet deadlines.  Komiya walks up to Asakawa\u0092s desk and holds out a MANILA FOLDER. \nKOMIYA Mrs. Asakawa? \nASAKAWA Okazaki, can I ask you a favor? \nOKAZAKI Sure. \nAsakawa points to the newspaper. \nASAKAWA Could you check out this article for me?  Get me some more info.? \nOKAZAKI I guess... \nASAKAWA Good.  Call me as soon as you know more, OK? \nOKAZAKI Ma\u0092am. \nAsakawa walks off.  Okazaki, still carrying the videotapes, leans forward to take a look at the article. \nEXT. APARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY \nAsakawa drives her car into the lot and parks quickly.  She gets out, runs up the STAIRCASE to the third floor.  She stops in front of a door, sticks her KEY in the lock, and opens it. \nINT. ASAKAWA\u0092S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM \u0096 DAY \nA BOY of about 7 is sitting in an ARMCHAIR facing the veranda.  We can see only the back of his head. \nASAKAWA (O.S.) Yoichi! \nHearing his name, the boy puts down the BOOK he was reading and stands up, facing the door.  He is wearing a white DRESS SHIRT with a brown sweater-type VEST over it.  He sees Asakawa, his mother, run in the door.  She is panting lightly. \nASAKAWA Sorry I\u0092m late.  Oh, you\u0092ve already changed. \nYOICHI Yup. \nHe points over to his mother\u0092s right. \nYOICHI (cont\u0092d) I got your clothes out for you. \nAsakawa turns to see a DARK SUIT hanging from one of the living room shelves.  She reaches out, takes it. \nASAKAWA Aargh, we\u0092ve gotta hurry! \nShe runs into the next room to change. \nINT.  BEDROOM \u0096 DAY \nAsakawa has changed into all-black FUNERAL ATTIRE.  Her hair is up, and she is fastening the clasp to a pearl NECKLACE.  Yoichi is still in the living room. \nASAKAWA Did grandpa call? \nYOICHI (O.S.) Nope. \nGIRL MIDDLE They say she won\u0092t go anywhere near a television. \nINT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH \u0096 DAY \nAsakawa and YOSHINO, another news reporter, are watching scenes from the Yokohama car death.  In the footage there are lots of POLICEMEN milling about, one of them trying to pick the door to the passenger side.  Yoshino is giving Asakawa the blow-by-blow. \nYOSHINO The bodies of those found were Tsuji Youko, age 17, a student of the Seikei School for Women, and Nomi Takehiko, age 19, preparatory school student.  Both their doors were securely locked. \nOnscreen, the policeman has finally picked the lock.  The door opens, and a girl\u0092s BODY half\u0096falls out, head facing upwards.  Yoshino flicks a BUTTON on the control panel, scans the footage frame by frame.  He stops when he gets a good close-up of the victim. \nHer face is twisted into an insane rictus of fear, mouth open, eyes wide and glassy. Yoshino and Asakawa lean back in their seats. \nYOSHINO This is the first time I\u0092ve -ever- seen something like this. \nASAKAWA Cause of death? \nYOSHINO Couldn\u0092t say, aside from sudden heart failure. \nASAKAWA Drugs? \nYOSHINO The autopsy came up negative. \nYoshino takes the video off pause.  Onscreen, a policeman has caught the young girl\u0092s body from completely falling out, and is pushing it back into the car.  As the body moves into an upright position, we can see that the girl\u0092s PANTIES are mid-way around her left thigh. \nYOSHINO These two, about to go at it, suddenly up and die for no apparent reason. \nHe sighs. \nYOSHINO (cont\u0092d) Do -you- get it? \nEXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DAY \nAsakawa\u0092s CAR is already halted before a modest-sized, two-story HOUSE with a small covered parkway for a garage.  She gets out of her car, closes the door.  She stares at the house, unmoving. \nINT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD \u0096 KITCHEN - DAY \nAsakawa stands before her SISTER RYOMI, who is seated at the kitchen TABLE.  Ryomi is staring blankly away, making no sign of acknowledging her sister.  The silence continues unabated, and Asakawa, pensive, wanders idly into the adjoining dining room.  She takes a long look at the television, the same television that had puzzled Tomoko by suddenly switching itself on, sitting darkly in one corner.  Her reflection in the screen looks stretched, distorted. \nRYOMI\t(O.S.) They tell me that Yoichi came to the funeral, too. \nAsakawa steps back into the kitchen.  She addresses her sister, who continues to stare out at nothing. \nASAKAWA Mmm-hmm. \nRYOMI They used to play a lot together, didn\u0092t they?  Upstairs. \nASAKAWA Yeah... \nRyomi lapses back into a silence.  Asakawa waits for her to say more, but when it is clear that nothing else is forthcoming, she quietly gives up and exits the kitchen. \nYoichi walks off.  Asakawa goes back to the stove, but stops after only a few stirs, staring off and thinking. \nCaption-- \u0093September 13th.  Monday.\u0094 \nEXT. ROAD \u0096 DAY \nAsakawa drives her car speedily along a narrow country road, LEAVES blowing up in her wake. \nINT. ASAKAWA\u0092S CAR - DAY \nAsakawa mutters to herself, deep in thought. \nASAKAWA There\u0092s no way... \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD \u0096 DAY \nAsakawa\u0092s car drives past a sign reading: \nIZU PACIFIC LAND \nEXT. IZU PACIFIC LAND - DRIVEWAY \u0096 DAY \nAsakawa has left her car and is walking around the driveway of what is less a bed and breakfast and more like a series of cabin-style rental COTTAGES. \nShe wanders about for a while, trying to get her bearings.  She pauses now in front of a particular cottage and reaches into her PURSE.  She withdraws the PICTURE from the photomat, the one that showed Tomoko and her friends with their faces all blurred.  The four are posing in front of their cottage, marked in the photograph as \u0093B4.\u0094  Asakawa lowers the photo to regard the cottage before her. \nB4 \nShe walks to the door, turns the handle experimentally.  It\u0092s open. Asakawa walks in. \nINT. PACIFIC LAND - COTTAGE B4 \u0096 DAY \nAsakawa lets her eyes wander around the cottage.  It looks very modern, all wood paneling and spacious comfort. \nHer eyes rest on the TV/VCR setup at the front of the room.  Crouching before the VCR now, she presses the eject button.  Nothing happens. She fingers the inside of the deck, finds it empty, then reaches behind to the rear of the VCR, searching.  Again, there is nothing.  Asakawa presses the power button on the television, picks up the REMOTE, and takes a seat on the SOFA.  She runs through a few channels but they\u0092re all talk shows, no clues whatsoever.  She flicks the TV off and leans back in the sofa, sighing. \nJust then, she spies a LEDGER on the coffee table.  These things are sometimes left in hotels in Japan, so that guests can write a few comments about their stay for others to read.  Asakawa picks the ledger up, begins thumbing through it.  She stops at a strange PICTURE obviously drawn by a child, that shows three rotund, almost entirely round personages.  She reads the handwritten MESSAGE. \nASAKAWA \"My dad is fat.  My mom is fat. That\u0092s why I\u0092m fat, too.\" \nShe smiles in spite of herself. \nAsakawa flips through the rest of the ledger, but there\u0092s nothing else of any import. \nShe tosses it back onto the coffee table and, sighing again, leans into the sofa and closes her eyes. \nEXT. OUTDOOR CAF\u00c9 - DUSK \nAsakawa eats silently, alone. \nIt\u0092s not the moon at all, she realizes.  The shape is round like a full moon, but it seems to be made up of thin RIBBONS of cloud streaking against a night sky.  And there\u0092s a FACE, she sees, a face hidden in shadows, looking down from above. \nWhat is this? \nThe scene changes now, and Asakawa notes that the tape has that kind of grainy quality one sees in 3rd or 4th generation copies.  The scene is of a WOMAN brushing her long hair before an oval-shaped MIRROR.  The nerve- wracking grating as if of some giant metallic insect sounds in the background, but the lady doesn\u0092t seem to notice.  The mirror the lady is using to brush her hair suddenly changes position from the left part of the wall before which she stands, to the right.  Almost instantly the mirror returns to its original position, but in that one moment in its changed location we see a small FIGURE in a white GOWN.  The woman turns towards where that figure stood, and smiles. \nThe screen next becomes a twitching, undulating impenetrable sea of the kanji characters used in the Japanese language.  Asakawa can pick out only two things recognizable: \nlocal     volcanic eruption \nNow the screen is awash in PEOPLE-- crawling, scrabbling, shambling masses, some of them moving in reverse.  A sound like moaning accompanies them. \nA FIGURE stands upon a shore, its face shrouded.  It points accusingly, not towards the screen, but at something unseen off to one side.  The insect-like screeching sounds louder. \nClose up on inhuman, alien-looking EYE.  Inside that eye a single character is reflected in reverse:  SADA, meaning \"chastity.\" \nThe eye blinks once, twice.  The symbol remains. \nA long shot of an outdoor, uncovered WELL. \nSudden loud, blinding STATIC as the tape ends. \nAsakawa turns the TV off, looking physically drained.  She sighs shakily and slumps forward, resting on her knees.  Just then, she glances at the television screen.  She sees, reflected, a small FIGURE in a white gown standing at the rear of the room.  Shocked, Asakawa draws in breath, spins around. \nThe room is empty.  Asakawa runs to the sofa to collect her jacket-- \n--and the RINGING of the telephone stops her dead in her tracks.  Zombie- like, she walks towards the telephone, picks it up wordlessly. \nFrom the other end comes the same metallic, insectoid SQUEAKING heard on the video.  Asakawa slams the phone down and glances up at the CLOCK. It\u0092s about seven minutes after 7 P.M. \nASAKAWA (to herself) One week \nAsakawa grabs her coat, pops the tape out of the deck, and runs out the door. \nEXT. STREET \u0096 DAY \nIt is dark and raining heavily.  Yoichi, Asakawa\u0092s son, is walking to school, UMBRELLA firmly in hand.  The sidewalk is quite narrow, and Yoichi comes to a halt when a second PERSON comes from the opposite direction, blocking his way. Yoichi slowly raises his umbrella, peers up to look at this other pedestrian.  It is a MAN, a BAG slung over one shoulder.  He has a beard; unusual for Japan where clean-shaven is the norm. \nThe two continue looking directly at each other, neither moving nor speaking.  Yoichi then walks around the person\u0092s left and continues on his way.  The man resumes walking as well. \nCaption-- \u0093September 14th.  Tuesday.\u0094 \nEXT. OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT DOOR - DAY \nThe bearded man, whose name is RYUJI, reaches out to press the DOORBELL, but the door has already opened from within.  Asakawa leans out, holding the door open for him.  Neither of them speaks.  Wordlessly, Ryuji enters the apartment. \nINT. ASAKAWA\u0092S APARTMENT - DAY \nRyuji puts his bag down, looks around the apartment.  The interior is dark, ominous somehow.  He takes his JACKET off and wanders into the living room. Asakawa is in the kitchen behind him, preparing TEA.  Ryuji spies the collection of FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS in living room. \nAsakawa re-enters her apartment. \nINT. ASAKAWA\u0092S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY \nRYUJI Well, it looks like your phone\u0092s not ringing. \nRyuji pops the tape from the deck, hands it to Asakawa. \nRYUJI Make me a copy of this, will you? I\u0092d like to do a little research of my own. There\u0092s no reason to write us off as dead just yet. \nHe dramatically takes a seat. \nRYUJI\t(cont\u0092d) If there\u0092s a video, that means that somebody had to make it. \nASAKAWA There\u0092s the guest list from the cottage to look into... and the possibility of someone hacking into the local station\u0092s broadcast signals. \nAsakawa pulls a NOTEPAD from her purse and begins busily scribbling away. \nINT. NEWS STATION - DAY \nOkazaki putters around. \nCaption-\u0097 \u0093September 15th.  Tuesday.\u0094 \nINT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH \u0096 DAY \nAsakawa sits by herself, reviewing the videotape.  She is replaying the very last scene, an outdoor shot of a well.  She stares at it carefully, and notices... \nThe tape ends, filling the screen with static.  A split-second afterwards, there is a KNOCK on the door and Okazaki enters, holding a FILE.  Asakawa momentarily forgets about the video. \nOKAZAKI (handing her the file) Here\u0092s that guest list you wanted. \nASAKAWA Oh, thanks. \nOKAZAKI What are you gonna do with this? \nASAKAWA Uh... sorry, I\u0092m working on something personal. \nEXT. IN FRONT OF A TRAIN STATION - DAY \nSome quick shots of a FOUNTAIN gushing water, PIGEONS flapping away looking agitated.  CUT to Ryuji sitting on a BENCH.  He\u0092s deep in thought, writing in a NOTEPAD. There are multitudes of PEOPLE about him, and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going.  A PAIR OF LEGS attached to a woman in white dress, hose, and pumps appears, heading directly for Ryuji.  Her pace is slow, rhythmical, and as that pace progresses all other sounds FADE into the background, so that all we can hear is the CLOMP, CLOMP as those legs walk to stand just before Ryuji.  The pumps are scuffed, dirtied with grime. \nA gust of WIND rips by.  Ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his ears rings the same hollowed, multi-voiced BABBLING heard on the videotape.  The sound grows stronger. \nRYUJI (VO) So, it was you.  You did it. \nThe babbling fades, disappears as slowly the world\u0092s normal background sounds return.  Ryuji looks up, but the woman in white is nowhere to be seen. \nEXT. OUTSIDE RYUJI\u0092S APARTMENT \u0096 AFTERNOON \nShe takes the remote from Ryuji, rewinds it a ways.  Onscreen, the woman begins coming her long hair again. \nASAKAWA From this angle, the mirror should be reflecting whoever\u0092s filming. \nRYUJI So, what does that mean? \nAsakawa lets out a short sigh. \nASAKAWA Well, if the person who made this is a pro, there\u0092d be a way around that, I guess, but still... \nThe screen changes, showing the mass of squiggling kanji characters again. \nRYUJI (reading) Volcanic eruption... Eruption where? \nHe pauses the screen, trying to make sense of what is written. \nASAKAWA This is gonna be impossible to figure out on just a regular TV screen, don\u0092t you think? \nThey are both still staring at the screen when from behind them comes the SOUND of someone opening the front door.  Ryuji turns off the TV, ejects the tape from the deck. \nRYUJI Come on in. \nAsakawa flashes a look at Ryuji and then turns her head back towards the front door to see who has entered.  A cute, nervous-looking young GIRL with short hair approaches slowly.  She is carrying a PLASTIC BAG filled with groceries. \nRYUJI Asakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai. \nHe turns, addresses Mai. \nRYUJI\t(cont\u0092d) This is Asakawa, my ex-wife. \nRyuji gets up and walks conveniently away. \nMAI Nice to meet you.  I\u0092m Takano. \nASAKAWA Asakawa. * \n> * As you may already be aware, Japanese name order is the >opposite of English\u0092s, and even close friends may continue to >address one another by their last names.  Incidentally, Asakawa\u0092s >first name is \u0093Reiko.\u0094  In this scene, Mai deferentially refers >to Ryuji as sensei, meaning \u0093teacher.\u0094 \nMai sets the bag of groceries down and chases after Ryuji.  He is putting on his jacket and getting ready to leave. \nMAI Sensei, the people from the publishing company called about the deadline on your thesis again. \nRYUJI (brusquely) What\u0092re they talkin\u0092 to you about it for? \nMAI Because they can never get a hold of you. \nRyuji picks up his keys, video firmly in hand. \nRYUJI Ask them to wait another week. \nAsakawa nods.  Ryuji is already writing it down excitedly. \nASAKAWA What does that mean? \nRyuji tears the sheet of paper off the notepad, folds it, and tucks it into his shirt pocket. \nRYUJI I\u0092m gonna check it out. \nEXT. ASAKAWA\u0092S APARTMENT COMPLEX - MORNING \nYoichi is walking to school.  He looks back over his shoulder, just once,then resumes walking. \nINT. ASAKAWA\u0092S APARTMENT - MORNING \nAll the lights are turned off, and she is sitting on the living room couch watching the footage of her caf\u00e9 interview with the junior high school girls. \nCaption-- \u0093September 16th.  Thursday.\u0094 \nJust when the girl in the interview mentions that whomever watches the video is supposed to afterwards receive a phone call, Asakawa\u0092s own phone RINGS, startling her. She runs to answer it. \nASAKAWA Hello? \nRYUJI (O.S.) I\u0092ve got it.  It\u0092s a dialect, just like I thought.  SHOUMON means \u0093playing in the water\u0094 and BOUKON means \u0093monster.\u0094 * \n>* Translated from standard Japanese, the phrase from the videotape >would initially have sounded like, \"If only SHOUMON then the >BOUKON will come.\"  These two capitalized words, later identified to >be dialectical, were at the time completely incomprehensible to Ryuji >and Asakawa.  Dialect can vary dramatically from region to region in >Japan, to the point of speakers of different dialect being unable to >understand one another. \n>The phrase on the tape can now be rendered, \"If you keep playing in >the water, the monster will come for you.\" \nASAKAWA But, dialect from where? \nRYUJI Oshima.  And the site of our \u0093eruption\u0094 is Mt. Mihara. \nINT. LIBRARY - NIGHT \nRyuji and Asakawa are seated at cubicles, looking through bound ARCHIVES of old newspaper articles.  Asakawa sneaks a look at Ryuji, stands up and walks off a little ways.  She has already pulled out her cell phone. \nASAKAWA (whispering, on phone) Yoichi?  I\u0092m gonna be a little late tonight, honey. \nRyuji looks over his shoulder at her, scowls. \nASAKAWA You can do it yourself, right?  OK. Sorry.  Bye. \nShe hangs up, returns to her seat at the cubicle.  She resumes her scanning of the newspaper articles, and Ryuji shoots her another scowl. Asakawa turns a page and then stops, frowning.  She has spied an article that looks like... \nNervously, Asakawa puts the thumb and forefinger of each hand together, forming the shape of a rectangle.  Or a screen.  She places the rectangle over the article she has just discovered, its headlines reading: \nMount Mihara Erupts \tLocal Residents Urged to Take Precautions \nRyuji notices her, leans forward excitedly. \nKAZUE And for your rooms, how shall we...? \nRYUJI Separate, please. \nKAZUE \u0091Sir. \nINT. YAMAMURA VILLA - 2ND FLOOR \u0096 DAY \nKazue gives a little bow. \nKAZUE This way. \nKazue turns to the right.  Almost immediately after reaching the top of the steps, however, a strange look crosses Ryuji\u0092s face. He heads down the opposite end of the corridor, Asakawa close behind. \nKAZUE (alarmed) Sir! \nRyuji flings open the SLIDING DOOR to one of the older rooms.  There, hanging from one of the walls, is the oval-shaped MIRROR from the video, the one used by the mysterious lady to brush her long hair. Ryuji stares at the mirror, almost wincing.  He turns around as if to look at Asakawa,but continues turning, looks past her.  Asakawa follows his gaze, as does Kazue.  Standing at the end of the corridor is an old man, MR. YAMAMURA. \nYamamura regards them silently, balefully.  Breaking the silence, Kazue gestures for Asakawa and Ryuji to follow. \nKAZUE (softly) Please, this way. \nAsakawa races past the innkeeper towards the old man.  He keeps his back turned towards her. \nASAKAWA Please!  If you could just answer a few questions, about Shizuko... \nYAMAMURA I got nuthin\u0092 to say. \nASAKAWA It\u0092s about Shizuko\u0092s daughter. \nThe old man says nothing. \nASAKAWA She did have a daughter, didn\u0092t she? \nYamamura regards her for a moment, then turns to walk away. \nYAMAMURA You\u0092re wasting your time. \nINT. YAMAMURA VILLA - DINING ROOM \u0096 NIGHT \nThe TABLE is laid out with an elaborate-looking DINNER.  Asakawa sits alone, knees curled up to her chin, eyes wide and frightened. She is whimpering softly to herself.  Just then, the DOOR slides open and Ryuji walks in.  He sits at the table and picks up a pair of CHOPSTICKS. \nRYUJI Aren\u0092t you gonna eat? \nASAKAWA Umm... \nRYUJI Hm? \nASAKAWA You\u0092ll stay with me won\u0092t you? When it\u0092s time for me to die. \nVOICE Shoumon bakkari... boukon ga kuru zo... \nEXT. IZU SEASHORE - DAY \nAsakawa watches Ryuji stride down the shore. \nCaption-- \u0093September 19th.  Monday.\u0094 \nRyuji strolls up to find old man Yamamura sitting alone, staring out at the sea.  Yamamura glances up to see Ryuji approaching. Ryuji takes a seat next to the old man, but it\u0092s Yamamura who speaks first.  The deep basso of his voice emphasizes the drawl of his accent. \nYAMAMURA Y\u0092all\u0092d do best to be off soon. Sea\u0092s probably gonna be rough tonight. \nRYUJI What kind of a child was Shizuko? \nYAMAMURA Shizuko was... different.  She\u0092d come out here by herself ever\u0092day an\u0092 just stare out at the ocean.  The fishermen all took a dislikin\u0092 to her.  Ocean\u0092s an unlucky place for us, y\u0092see: every year it swallows up more of our own. You keep starin\u0092 out at somethin\u0092 ike that... \nRYUJI Shoumon bakkari shite\u0092ru to, boukon ga kuru zo.  \u0093If you keep playing in the water, the monster will come for you.\u0094 \nYamamura looks at Ryuji, surprised. \nRYUJI Shizuko could see \u0093inside\u0094 people, couldn\u0092t she?  Down to the places they\u0092d most like to keep hidden.  It must have been difficult for her... \nYamamura rises unsteadily to his feet, features twisted angrily. \nYAMAMURA Please leave!  Now! \nRyuji stands, takes hold of Yamamura\u0092s arm. \nRYUJI I\u0092ve got a little of that ability myself.  It was you who spread the word about Shizuko, wasn\u0092t it? And you who first contacted Professor Ikuma? \nYAMAMURA What\u0092re you--? \nRYUJI You thought you\u0092d be able to make some money off her.  You even got some, from one of the newspapers. \nYAMAMURA Leave me the hell alone! \nMr. Yamamura strides angrily off.  Both Ryuji and Asakawa take pursuit, Ryuji calling out from behind Yamamura\u0092s back. \nRYUJI Tell us about Shizuko\u0092s daughter. Who was she? \nYAMAMURA I don\u0092t know! \nRYUJI She was there, with Shizuko. She had to be. \nYamamura\u0092s pace, which has become increasingly erratic, finally causes him to stumble and fall.  Ryuji comes up behind him, grasping him firmly.  At their touch Ryuji\u0092s power awakens, and as he peers into the old man\u0092s mind there is a sudden blinding \nFLASH \nThe setting is a large MEETING HALL.  A number of people are seated in folding chairs before a STAGE, on which are a four MEN in BUSINESS SUITS and a WOMAN in a KIMONO.  A BANNER hangs above the stage, which reads PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION ON THE EXISTENCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE. \nSHIZUKO Sadako?  Was it you? \nCUT to Ryuji on the beach.  He looks up excitedly. \nRYUJI Sadako?! \nHe recalls the image from the video, the alien eye with the single character SADA reflected in reverse. * \n>* The majority of girls' names in Japanese end in either -mi (\"beauty\") >or -ko (\"child\").  Thus, Sadako means \"Chaste child.\"  Sadako is, of >course, the mysterious daughter of Shizuko and Professor Ikuma. \nRYUJI Sadako killed him?  She can kill just with a thought? \nYAMAMURA She\u0092s... a devil spawn. \nCUT back to the demonstration hall.  Sadako, her face completely hidden by her long hair, runs offstage... and heads directly for Asakawa. Asakawa instinctively raises her arm, and Sadako grasps it fiercely. All the nails on Sadako\u0092 hand are stripped away; her fingers are raw, bloody stumps. \nCUT back to the beach.  Asakawa, still caught in the throes of the vision, has begun to swoon.  Finally her legs give out and she crumples to the beach.  Ryuji grabs hold of her supportively.  He glances down at her wrist, sees an ugly, purple BRUISE already beginning to form. \nThe bruise is in the shape of five long, spindly fingers. \nMr. Yamamura slowly rises to a sitting position, and together the three watch the approach of ominous, dark STORM CLOUDS. \nINT. MR. HAYATSU\u0092S HOUSE \u0096 DUSK \nAsakawa is on the phone, her voice almost frantic. \nASAKAWA That\u0092s right. After Yamamura Shizuko committed suicide, Professor Ikuma took the daughter and ran.  No, no one knows where they went.  That\u0092s why I need -you- to find out where they are. Even if the professor\u0092s dead, Sadako should still be in her forties.  I\u0092ll explain it all later, but right now just hurry! \nAsakawa slams the phone down.  PAN to show Ryuji slumped in one corner of the room, his back to the wall. \nRYUJI Sadako\u0092s probably already dead.  She could kill people with just a thought, remember?  Her mother wasn\u0092t even close to that. \nASAKAWA (flustered) Well, what about that video?  If Sadako\u0092s dead then who made it? \nRYUJI Nobody made it. It wasn\u0092t made at all. That video... is the pure, physical manifestation of Sadako\u0092s hatred. \nRyuji turns to regard Asakawa, his eyes blank. \nRYUJI We\u0092ve been cursed. \nThere is a moment of silence before Mr. Hayatsu slides the door open, almost falling into the room.  He is out of breath, and speaks rapidly. \nHAYATSU It\u0092s no good.  With the typhoon coming in, all ships are temporarily staying docked. \nRYUJI What about the fishing boats? Tell their captains I\u0092ll pay. \nHAYATSU Fishing boats?  Sir, without knowing whether this typhoon is going to hit us or not, I think it\u0092d be better to wait and see how things turn-- \nRyuji interrupts him, slamming both palms on the table.  Glasses rattle wildly. \nThe three fall into silence as they realize the powerlessness of their situation.  Suddenly, a deep VOICE booms from behind them. \nYAMAMURA (O.S.) I\u0092ll take you out. \nThe three spin around to see Mr. Yamamura, his ROBES flapping in the gusty night air. He begins walking towards them. \nYAMAMURA Sadako is callin\u0092 y\u0092all, reckon. Mayhap to drag you down under the water. \nShort silence.  Ryuji shoots a short questioning glance at Asakawa, turns back to face Mr. Yamamura. \nRYUJI Please.  Take us out. \nEXT. OCEAN \u0096 NIGHT \nA tiny FISHING BOAT is tossed about on the waves.  Mr. Yamamura stands at the wheel, his face expressionless. \nINT. MR. YAMAMURA\u0092S FISHING BOAT \u0096 NIGHT \nRyuji and Asakawa are crouched close together in the cabin.  Asakawa\u0092s expression is dreamy, faraway. \nASAKAWA It\u0092s funny.  I\u0092m not afraid at all. \nRyuji leans over, rubs her hand comfortingly.  Suddenly he switches back into analytical mode. \nRYUJI Sadako probably died back out there at Izu, before the rental cottages were ever built. \nASAKAWA So, Sadako was Professor Ikuma\u0092s daughter? \nRYUJI (nodding) Ikuma smuggled her out in secret. His relationship with Shizuko was already a scandal, and one of the reasons he got drummed out of the university... We\u0092ve gotta find Sadako\u0092s body. \nASAKAWA (excitedly) Is that going to break the curse? Will Yoichi be all right? \nRYUJI It\u0092s all we\u0092ve got left to try. \nASAKAWA Just one more day... \nRyuji puts his arm around Asakawa. \nEXT. MR. YAMAMURA\u0092S FISHING BOAT - DAWN \nRyuji stands on deck, looking out over the water.  He heads down below toward the captain\u0092s area.  Mr. Yamamura is at the wheel. \nRYUJI We made it.  Maybe Sadako doesn\u0092t have it out for us after all. \nLong pause as Mr. Yamamura says nothing. \nYAMAMURA Shizuko... she used to -speak- to the ocean, just ramble away.  One time I hid, listenin\u0092 to one of her conversations. \nMr. Yamamura pauses again. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD \u0096 DAY \nThe white rental car tears past the SIGN reading Izu Pacific Land. The car continues into the LOT, screeching around corners before coming to an abrupt halt.  Asakawa, her face still oddly expressionless, gets out of the passenger side.  Ryuji exits as well, the hint of a shudder running through him as he regards the series of rental cabins. \nRYUJI -Here-. \nCUT to Asakawa and Ryuji walking up the gravel PATH towards the rental cabins.  Ryuji looks back over his shoulder as both he and Asakawa stop before cabin B4.  The cabin is on STILTS, its underbelly fenced off by wooden LATICEWORK.  Ryuji drops most of his supplies to the ground, but keeps hold of the PICK.  He raises the pick over one shoulder and begins smashing away at the latticework.  When he has cleared enough space for passage, he begins picking up supplies and tossing them hastily within. When finished, he holds a hand out for Asakawa.  The two enter the earthen basement. \nUNDER COTTAGE B4 - DAY \nRyuji pulls a FLASHLIGHT out, flicks it on.  The BEAM arcs outwards, illuminating what looks more like an old mine shaft than a modern rental cottage.  The beam halts when it suddenly encounters an old STONE WELL.  The well is badly chipped on one side, and sealed off with a solid-looking stone LID.  Ryuji rushes quickly towards it. \nRYUJI I knew it!  The well. \nHe squats down beside the well, setting the flashlight on the lid.  Asakawa sinks slowly down beside him. \nASAKAWA The well... \nRyuji reaches out and takes Asakawa\u0092s hand.  He sets their enclasped hands onto the lid, and together they begin lightly tracing the surface of the lid with their free hands.  Asakawa closes her eyes in concentration... and suddenly, as with the incident on the beach, Asakawa finds herself drawn into Ryuji\u0092s psychometric VISION. \nFLASH \nThe picture is black and white, grainy like old film.  A YOUNG GIRL in a WHITE GOWN walks slowly towards an open well. She places her hand on the LIP of the well, peers curiously down. \nFLASH \nAsakawa looks up, her eyes wide open. \nFLASH \nThere is now a second person in the vision, an ELDERLY MAN in an old- fashioned tweed SUIT standing behind the young girl.  He suddenly produces some BLADED OBJECT, and strikes the girl savagely across the back of the head. \nThe girl falls forward. The man drops to the ground, grabbing the girl behind the knees and hoisting her limp BODY over the lip and into the well.  The body falls into its depths. \nPanting heavily, the man leans forward and grasps the lip of the well with both hands, looking down.  He flashes a guilty look in either direction, checking that his crime has gone unnoticed, and as he does so Asakawa realizes that she knows this face.  The image from the videotape, like a face in the moon: it had been Sadako inside the well, looking up to see this man staring back down at her. \nThis man whose name is Professor Ikuma Heihachiro. \nFLASH \nASAKAWA Her own father! \nThe energy seems to drain out of Asakawa in a rush, and her body crumbles.  Ryuji catches hold of her. \nRYUJI It was Ikuma who put this lid on. And Sadako\u0092s still inside. \nRyuji stands quickly, takes hold of the crowbar.  He inserts it under the lid and begins trying to pry it off, face scrunched with effort. Asakawa digs her fingers in and lends her own strength as well. Slowly, the lid begins to move.  Ryuji tosses the crowbar aside and the two lean the combined weight of their bodies into it.  The lid slides off, dropping to the earth with a dull THUD.  Ryuji sits to one side, winded with effort, as Asakawa takes hold of the flashlight.  She shines it down into the well, but it only seems to intensify the gloom. What WATER she can see looks fetid and brackish.  Ryuji sees her expression and begins removing his JACKET. \nRYUJI I\u0092ll go. \nShe lifts her head up but says nothing as Ryuji walks over to her. \nRYUJI We\u0092ll change.  You\u0092re in no condition to keep this up. \nAsakawa suddenly springs into life.  Her voice is frantic, fearful. \nASAKAWA: No! \nRYUJI Who do you expect to pull up these buckets, then? \nASAKAWA But, we don\u0092t even know if it\u0092s doing any good... \nRyuji strides forward and slaps Asakawa painfully across the cheek. He begins shaking her roughly for good measure. \nRYUJI And what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his mother not coming to pick him up after all? \nHe releases his hold on her.  The two stare at each other a long time, saying nothing. \nCUT to an overhead shot of Asakawa being lowered into the well. CUT now to Asakawa inside the well, her face and clothes covered with grime, body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright. Unable to resist the impulse, Asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder and down into the well.  The dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic. \nRYUJI Don\u0092t look down! \nShe returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward.  CUT to Ryuji leaning over the rim of the well, peering down at her.  For an instant, everything becomes monochrome. It\u0092s not Ryuji looking down at her at all; it\u0092s Professor Ikuma, checking to see if she\u0092s still alive or if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off.  CUT to Asakawa, her eyes wide with fright. \nAsakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well.  A FLASHLIGHT hangs from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness. Asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water. She calls out pleadingly. \nASAKAWA Where are you?  Please, come out. \nAsakawa straightens, unties herself from the rope.  A full bucket already awaits.  She tugs on the rope and Ryuji pulls it up. \nShe scoops up a second bucket, but something stops her from sending it up.  Instead, she begins running her arms through the water again, her voice close to tears. \nASAKAWA Please.  Where are you? \nAsakawa continues her blind fumbling, which sends up little splashes of stagnant water.  With a start, she realizes that her fingers have caught something.  Seaweed?  Asakawa draws her hands close for a better look... and sees that is HAIR.  A thick clump of long, black hair. \nSuddenly a pale, thin ARM shoots out from beneath the water, catching Asakawa just below the wrist.  Asakawa\u0092s ears are filled with a SOUND like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber.  It is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair.  CUT to a shot of Asakawa\u0092s face.  Far from being frightened, her features are oddly placid.  She regards the fearsome thing before her with an almost tender look.  Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long hair. \nASAKAWA It\u0092s you... \nShe strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head with a loud SQUELCH. Revealed is not a face at all but a SKULL.  Its sockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the green SLUDGE it has pulled up from the bottom of the well.  Like a mother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly. Her eyes begin to glaze. \nCUT to Ryuji racing up to the rim of the well, leaning down intently. \nRYUJI Hey!  Asakawa!  It\u0092s already 10 minutes past seven!  We did it! \nDown in the well, Asakawa continues staring blankly ahead.  Her body suddenly falls forward, limp. \nEXT. OUTSIDE COTTAGE B4 \u0096 NIGHT \nAsakawa emerges, taking in the dawn.  At first her face is calm and tranquil... but her features change as the sun almost noticeably darkens and a WIND begins to kick up her hair.  She now looks very anxious. \nCaption-- \u0093September 21st.  Tuesday.\u0094 \nNOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP reading this now and watch the scene for itself. \nINT. RYUJI\u0092S APARTMENT \u0096 MORNING \nRyuji is busy scribbling away at his notes again.  His hand suddenly ceases, eyes dancing worriedly as he hears a faint... \nNo. \nBreath rattling fearfully in his throat, Ryuji spins around to face the TELEVISION SET.  He gets out of his seat for a better look, falling to his knees on the tatami. \nThe image that fills the screen is the last scene from the videotape; the shot of the well. \nThe SOUND from before comes louder now, more insistent, a metallic screeching that both repulses and beckons him closer. Ryuji crawls on all fours towards the SCREEN, stares at its unchanging image with terrible foreboding. \nThere is a flash of MOTION as something shoots out of the well. A hand. First one, and then another, as Sadako, still in her grimy white dress, face hidden beneath long, oily strands of hair, begins slowly pulling herself out.  The television screen jumps unsteadily, fills with static as if barely able to contain her image. \nCUT back and forth between Ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic, and the television, which shows Sadako lurching ever closer. \nRYUJI (almost frantic) Why?! \nThe TELEPHONE rings, and Ryuji spins round towards it, breath catching in his throat.  He looks at the phone, over his shoulder at the television, back to the phone. \nRYUJI That\u0092s it!  Asakawa... \nRyuji scrambles wildly towards the phone.  He takes the receiver but is unable to do more than clutch it fearfully as his gaze is drawn inexorably back to the television.  Sadako\u0092s shrouded face has filled the entire screen... and then, television popping and crackling, she jerks forward and emerges from the television onto the floor of Ryuji\u0092s apartment.  Ryuji backs away, screaming in terror. \nRYUJI Aaargh! \nSadako lies prone, collapsed, hair splayed out like a drowned corpse. Only her FINGERS are active, crawling, feeling.  The TIPS of her fingers are little more than bloodied stumps, not a single fingernail on them.  She uses the strength in those fingers to pull herself forward, coming jerkily to her feet.  The joints of her body twist unnaturally, more insect-like than human. \nRyuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment as if looking for cover.  The strength has already begun to fade from his body, however, and his movements are clumsy, exaggerated. He falls to the floor, panting heavily. \nSadako turns to regard him, and for just an instant we can see beneath her impenetrable shroud of hair; a single EYE burns with manic, unbridled hatred. \nIts gaze meets Ryuji\u0092s, and his face twists into a grimace as he SCREAMS loudly. \nFLASH \nEXT. KOUJI\u0092S HOUSE - FRONT YARD \u0096 DAY \nYoichi sits on the lawn, doodling into a large SKETCHPAD.  He suddenly stops, eyes registering that he has somehow felt his father\u0092s death. \nINT. ASAKAWA\u0092S APARTMENT \u0096 DAY \nAsakawa clutches the RECEIVER to her ear.  She can still hear the sounds of metallic SCREECHING coming from the video, though they are now becoming softer. \n", "test1_input": "KOUICHI She\u0092s resting inside right now. She\u0092s shaken up pretty badly, you know.  It\u0092s best she just take things easy for a while. \nAsakawa nods. \nASAKAWA I\u0092ll go check on auntie and them, then. \nKOUICHI OK.  Ah, Yoichi.  Why don\u0092t you sit here for a little while? \nHe grabs the young boy and seats him on a cushion next to the two guests. As the guests resume their conversation with Asakawa\u0092s father, Yoichi\u0092s eyes wander to the ALTAR at the front of the room set up to honor the deceased.  It is made of wood, and surrounded by candles, flowers, and small paper lanterns.  At the center is a PICTURE of the deceased, a teenage girl.  A small wooden PLAQUE reads her name: Tomoko Ouishi. It is the same Tomoko from the first scene. \nYoichi continues to stare at Tomoko\u0092s picture.  He makes a peculiar gesture as he does so, rubbing his index finger in small circles just between his eyes. \nINT. HALLWAY \u0096 NIGHT \nAsakawa walks down the hallway, looking for her aunt.  She walks until finding the open doorway to the kitchen.  There are a few people in there, preparing busily. Asakawa sees her AUNT, who rushes into the hallway to meet her, holds her fast by the arm.  The aunt speaks in a fierce, quick whisper. \nAUNT Have you heard anything more about Tomo-chan\u0092s death? \nASAKAWA No, I... \nAUNT But the police have already finished their autopsy! \nASAKAWA Well, they said there was no sign of foul play. \nAUNT (shaking her head) That was no normal death.  They haven\u0092t once opened the casket to let us see the body.  Don\u0092t you think that\u0092s strange? \nAsakawa looks away, thinking. \nINT. HALLWAY \u0096 NIGHT \nYoichi has wandered off by himself.  He stops at the foot of the steps, looking up-- and catches a glimpse of a pair of BARE FEET running up to the second floor. \nA guarded expression on his face, Yoichi walks slowly up the stairs. \nINT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKO\u0092S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nYoichi has wandered into Tomoko\u0092s bedroom.  The lights are all off, and there is an eerie feel to it.  Yoichi\u0092s eyes wander about the room, finally coming to rest on the TELEVISION SET.  Suddenly, he hears his mother\u0092s voice from behind him. \nASAKWAWA (O.S.) Yoichi? \nYoichi turns to face her as she approaches, puts an arm around him. \nASAKAWA What are you doing up here?  You shouldn\u0092t just walk into other people\u0092s rooms. \nWithout replying, Yoichi\u0092s gaze slowly returns to the television set.  Asakawa holds him by the shoulders, turning him to meet her. \nASAKAWA You go on downstairs, OK? \nYOICHI OK. \n", "test1_true": "INT. OUSHI HOUSEHOLD - TOP OF THE STAIRS \u0096 NIGHT \nJust as Yoichi and Asakawa are about to descend the steps, Asakawa\u0092s CELL PHONE rings.  She opens the clasp to her PURSE. \nASAKAWA (to Yoichi) You go on ahead. \nYOICHI \u0091K. \nHe walks down the steps.  Asakawa brings out her cell phone, answers it. \nASAKAWA Hello? \nOKAZAKI Uh... this is Okazaki.  I\u0092ve got some more info on that article for you.  The girl was a student of the uh, Seikei School for Women in Yokahama City. \nAsakawa blinks at this, looks disturbed. \nASAKAWA (softly) Thanks. \nShe hangs up the phone. \nEXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT \nAsakawa stands now at the entrance of the house.  Dazedly, she walks toward a large, hand-painted PLACARD.  The placard reads that the wake is being held for a student of the Seikei School for Women. \nAsakawa stares at that placard, making the mental connections. She turns abruptly, walks towards a nearby TRIO of HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS. \nASAKAWA Excuse me.  This is, um, kind of a strange question, but by any chance were you friends of that young girl that died in the car as well? \nThe three girls turn their faces to the ground. \nASAKAWA Please.  If you know anything... \nGIRL RIGHT They all died the same day.  Youko. Tomoko.  Even Iwata, he was in a motorcycle accident. \nGIRL LEFT Because they watched the video. \nASAKAWA Video? \nGIRL LEFT That\u0092s what Youko said.  They all watched some weird video, and after that their phone rang. \nASAKAWA Tomoko-chan watched it, too? Where? \nGirl Left shakes her head. \nGIRL LEFT She just said they all stayed somewhere. \nGIRL RIGHT There was a girl with Tomoko when she died.  She\u0092s had to be hospitalized for shock. \n", "test1_id": 2487, "test2_input": "Yoichi tries to scoop up the fish his grandfather is pointing out. \nKOUICHI Oh, oh!

KOUICHI\u0092S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nYoichi is passed out asleep on the tatami mats.  A TELEVISION looms inone corner of the living room, but it is switched off.  The SLIDING DOORS to the adjacent guest room are open and we can see futons set out, ready for bed. \nAsakawa enters the living room and, seeing Yoichi, scoops him up in her arms and carries him over to the guest room. \nYOICHI (sleepily) How was work, mommy? \nAsakawa tucks him into the futons and walks silently off. \nINT. KOUICHI\u0092S HOUSE - STAIRCASE \u0097 NIGHT \nAsakawa stands at the foot of the staircase, telephone RECEIVER in hand.  The phone rests on a small STAND by the staircase. \nASAKAWA Hello? \nRYUJI (O.S.) Yeah.  Your Oshima contact came through.  It looks like the woman who predicted the Mihara eruption is the same woman from the video. \nINT. RYUJI\u0092S APARTMENT \u0097 NIGHT \nRyuji is crouched in front of the TV, REMOTE in hand.  The screen is paused on the scene of the woman brushing her long hair. \nRYUJI Her name is Yamamura Shizuko.  She committed suicide forty years ago by throwing herself into Mt. Mihara. \nINT. KOUJI\u0092S HOUSE \u0096 STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nASAKAWA Have you got anything else? \nRYUJI (O.S.) I\u0092m gonna have to check it for myself.

I\u0092ll be in touch. \nRyuji hangs up.  Asakawa, deep in thought, slowly places the phone back in its CRADLE.  She turns around to walk back down the hallway only to find her father standing there, face full of concern. \nKOUJI What\u0092s happened? \nAsakawa shakes her head. \nASAKAWA Nothing.  I just had some things left over from work. \nShe walks past her father, who glances worriedly after her over his shoulder. \nINT. KOUJI\u0092S HOUSE - GUEST ROOM \u0097 NIGHT \nThe lights are all off and Asakawa is asleep in her futon.  Her eyes suddenly fly open as a VOICE sounding eerily like her deceased niece Tomoko calls out to her. \nTOMOKO (O.S.) Auntie? \nAsakawa looks around the room, gets her bearings.  Her eyes fall on the futon next to hers. \nASAKAWA Yoichi? \nThere is a BODY in that futon, but it is full-grown, dressed all in black.  It is curled into a fetal position and has its head turned away. \nSuddenly, the IMAGE from the video of the figure with its face shrouded springs to Asakawa\u0092s mind.  Just an instant, its pointing visage materializes, and then disappears.  It reappears a moment later, pointing more insistently now, and disappears again. \nAsakawa blinks her eyes and realizes that the futon next to hers is empty.  Yoichi is nowhere to be seen. \nJust then, she hears that high-pitched, metallic SQUEAKING from the video.  Eyes wide with horror, she flings the sliding doors apart-- --and there, seated before the television, is Yoichi. \nHe is watching the video. \nIt is already at the very last scene, the shot of the outdoor well. CLOSEUP on the screen now, and for just an instant we can see that something is trying to claw its way out of the well.  The video cuts off, and the screen fills with static. \nShrieking, Asakawa races over to Yoichi, covers his eyes though it is already too late.  She scoots over to the VCR, ejects the tape and stares at it uncomprehendingly.  She is then at Yoichi\u0092s side again, shaking him roughly. \nASAKAWA Yoichi!  You brought this with you, didn\u0092t you?  Why?!? \nYOICHI Tomo-chan... \nAsakawa freezes, her eyes wide. \nYOICHI Tomo-chan told me to watch it. \nEXT. OCEAN \u0097 DAY \nWAVES are being kicked up by a large PASSENGER SHIP as it speeds on its way.  CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji standing on deck, looking out over the waves. \n", "test2_id": 2488, "test3_input": "RYUJI I should\u0092ve been more careful. When I was at your place that day, I could feel something there.  I thought it was just because of the video... \nASAKAWA You mean that Tomoko\u0097 \nRYUJI That\u0092s not Tomoko.  Not anymore. \nASAKAWA Yoichi... he can see them too, can\u0092t he? \nRyuji nods his head, lowers it sadly. \nASAKAWA It\u0092s all my fault.  First Tomoko died, then those three others.  It should have stopped there, but it didn\u0092t.  Because of me. \nRYUJI I wonder... \nAsakawa turns to Ryuji suddenly. \nASAKAWA How did the rumors about the video even start in the first place? \nRYUJI This kind of thing... it doesn\u0092t start by one person telling a story.  It\u0092s more like everyone\u0092s fear just takes on a life of its own. \nASAKAWA Fear... \nRYUJI Or maybe it\u0092s not fear at all. Maybe it\u0092s what we were secretly hoping for all along. \nEXT. PORT \u0097 DAY \nThe ship has docked, its GANGPLANK extended.  Ryuji and Asakawa walk the length of the gangplank towards the shore.  A man named MR. HAYATSU is already waiting for them.  He holds up a white SIGNBOARD in both hands. \nASAKAWA Mr. Hayatsu? \nHAYATSU Aah, welcome!  You must be tired after your long trip.  Please, this way. \nMr. Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to an awaiting minivan. \nCaption-- \u0093September 18th.  Saturday.\u0094 \nINT. HAYATSU\u0092S MINIVAN - DAY \nRyuji and Asakawa sit in the back.  Mr. Hayatsu is behind the wheel, chattering away. \nHAYATSU Back in the old days, the Yamamuras used to head fishing boats out in Sashikiji, though they don\u0092t much anymore.  You know, one of Shizuko\u0092s cousins is still alive. He\u0092s just an old man now.  His son and his daughter-in-law run an old-fashioned inn.  I went ahead and booked reservations for y\u0092all, hope that\u0092s alright... \nAsakawa gives the briefest of nods in reply, after which the minivan lapses into silence.  Asakawa looks dreamily out at the mountain-studded landscape, then suddenly snaps to. \nASAKAWA (to Ryuji) Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit suicide? \nRYUJI She was taking a real beating in the press, being called a fraud and all sorts of names. After a while she just lost it. \nCUT to a scene of the minivan speeding along a country road. \n", "test3_true": "RYUJI Shizuko was getting a lot of attention around the island after predicting the eruption of Mt. Mihara.  Seems that for some time she\u0092d had a rather unique ability: precognition. It was around then that she attracted the attention of a certain scholar whom you may have heard of; Ikuma Heihachiro. \nASAKAWA He was driven out of the university, wasn\u0092t he? \nRyuji nods. \nRYUJI This Professor Ikuma convinces Shizuko to go to Tokyo with him, where he uses her in a series of demonstrations meant to prove the existence of ESP.  At first she\u0092s the darling of the press, but the next thing you know they\u0092re knocking her down, calling her a fraud.  Hmph.  Forty years later, the media still hasn\u0092t changed that much. \nAsakawa continues, ignoring Ryuji\u0092s barb. \nASAKAWA I\u0092ve heard this story.  But... I\u0092m sure I remember hearing that somebody died at one of those demonstrations. \nA strange look crosses Ryuji\u0092s face.  He looks away, ignores her for a moment. \nRYUJI After getting kicked out of university, Ikuma just vanished, and no one\u0092s been able to get hold of him since.  He\u0092s probably not even alive anymore. \nASAKAWA But, why even try looking for him? \nRYUJI Because he\u0092s supposed to have had a child with Shizuko.  A daughter. \nAsakawa freezes.  In her mind, she sees a small FIGURE dressed in white, its face hidden by long, black HAIR.  It is the figure from the video. \nEXT. OUTSIDE YAMAMURA VILLA - DAY \nMr. Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to the entrance. \nHAYATSU Hello? \nThe INKEEPER, a middle-aged lady named KAZUE wearing a traditional KIMONO, comes shuffling up.  She addresses Mr. Hayatsu. \nKAZUE Thank you. \nShe turns to Asakawa and Ryuji. \nKAZUE (cont\u0092d) Welcome. \nHAYATSU Well, I\u0092ll be off then. \nHe gives a little bow and is off.  Kazue, meanwhile, has produced two pairs of SLIPPERS, which she offers to Ryuji and Asakawa. \nKAZUE Please. \nRyuji and Asakawa begin removing their shoes. \nINT. YAMAMURA VILLA \u0096 STAIRCASE - DAY \nKazue leads Ryuji and Asakawa up a shadowed, wooden STAIRCASE. \n", "test3_id": 2489}

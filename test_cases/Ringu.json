{"test1_input": "Tomoko nods, uh-huh.  Masami dives forward, pinching her friend\u0092s cheeks and grinning wildly. \nMASAMI So, how far did you and he get? \nTOMOKO Oh... I can\u0092t remember. \nMASAMI You can\u0092t remember, huh? \nMasami laughs, then slaps Tomoko on the knee again as she remembers the trick her friend played on her. \nMASAMI Man, you had me freaked me out. I-- \nJust at that moment, the phone RINGS.  They are both suddenly, instantly serious.  Tomoko\u0092s eyes go off in one direction and she begins shaking her head, -No-.  Masami looks over her shoulder, following her friend\u0092s gaze. \nTomoko is looking at the CLOCK, which currently reads 9:40. \nThe phone continues to ring.  Tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her friend, looking panicked. \nMASAMI (softly) Was it true? \nTomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly.  Masami has to forcibly disengage herself in order to stand.  The phone is downstairs, so Masami opens the bedroom DOOR and races down the STAIRS.  Tomoko calls out to her from behind. \nTOMOKO Masami! \nINT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD \u0096 STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nTomoko and Masami run down the staircase, through the hallway towards the kitchen.  Tomoko cries out again just before they reach the kitchen. \nTOMOKO Masami! \nINT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD \u0096 KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMasami has come to a halt before a PHONE mounted on the wall.  She pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone.  She takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly.  The tension continues to mount as nothing is said. Masami suddenly breaks into a huge grin. \nMASAMI I\u0092ll put her on. \nStill grinning, she hands the phone to Tomoko.  Tomoko snatches it quickly. \nTOMOKO (softly) Yes? \nShe is silent for a moment, then smiling widely. \nTOMOKO Oh, man! \nShe is so relieved that all the strength seeps out of her and she sinks to the kitchen floor.  Masami, equally relieved, slides down the wall and sits down next to her. \nTOMOKO (on the phone) Yeah, I\u0092ve got a friend over now. Yeah.  Yeah, OK.  Bye. \nTomoko stands to place the phone back in its wall cradle, and then squats back down onto the kitchen floor. \n", "test1_true": "They burst out laughing with relief again, and are soon both clutching their stomachs. \nTOMOKO Jeeezus, my parents... \nMASAMI Oh man, I\u0092m tellin\u0092 everybody about this tomorrow! \nTomoko shakes her head, -Don\u0092t you dare-. \nMASAMI I\u0092m gonna use your bathroom.  Don\u0092t go anywhere. \nTOMOKO \u0091K. \nMasami walks out of the kitchen. Alone now, Tomoko stands and walks toward the SINK, where she takes a GLASS from the DISH RACK.  She then goes to the FRIDGE and sticks her face in, looking for something to drink.  Suddenly there is the SOUND of people clapping and cheering.  Tomoko, startled, peers her head over the refrigerator door to check for the source of the sound. \nShe begins walking slowly, following the sound to the DINING ROOM adjacent the kitchen. \nINT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe lights are off, and there is no one in the room.  Tomoko pauses a moment, bathed in the garish LIGHT from the TV, which has been switched on.  Playing is the same baseball game they had on the TV upstairs; the same game that Tomoko\u0092s parents are currently at.  The VOLUME is up quite high. \nA puzzled look on her face, Tomoko takes the REMOTE from the coffee table and flicks the TV off.  She walks back to the kitchen. \nINT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD \u0096 KITCHEN - NIGHT \nA bottle of SODA that Tomoko had earlier taken from the fridge is on the kitchen table.  She picks the bottle up, pours herself a drink. Before she can take a sip, however, the air around her becomes suddenly charged, heavy.  Her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight comes a popping, crackling SOUND underscored by a kind of GROANING. Trembling now, Tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt lurking behind her.  She draws in her breath to scream. \nThe screen goes white, and fades into: \nCAMERA POV \nThe screen is filled with the visage of a nervous-looking YOUNG GIRL. She is being interviewed by ASAKAWA, a female reporter seated offscreen. \nASAKAWA (O.S.) There seems to be a popular rumor going around about a \u0094cursed\u0094 videotape. \nYOUNG GIRL Uh-huh. \nASAKAWA (O.S.) Have you heard what kind of video it might be? \nYOUNG GIRL Uh-huh. \nThe girl looks directly at the camera, her mouth dropping into an \u0093O\u0094 as she\u0092s suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright.  She continues staring, silently, at the camera. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nKOMIYA, the cameraman, has lowered his camera. We can now see that the young girl being interviewed is seated at a table between two friends, a SHORT-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL#2) and a LONG-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL #3). They are all dressed in the UNIFORMS of junior high school students. Opposite them sits Komiya and Asakawa, a pretty woman in her mid- twenties.  A BOOM MIKE GUY stands to the left. \nKOMIYA Uh, don\u0092t look right at the camera, OK? \n", "test1_id": 2487, "test2_input": "YOUNG GIRL Sorry. \nASAKAWA Let\u0092s do it again. \nAsakawa glances over her shoulder, makes sure that Komiya is ready. \nASAKAWA Have you heard what kind of video it might be? \nYOUNG GIRL What I heard was, all of a sudden this scaaarry lady comes on the screen and says, \u0093In one week, you will die.\u0094 \nGIRL #2 I heard that if you\u0092re watching TV late at night it\u0092ll come on, and then your phone\u0092ll ring. \nASAKAWA Watching TV late at night... do you know what station? \nGIRL #2 Mmmm... I heard some local station, around Izu. \nASAKAWA Izu? \nGIRL #2 Mmm-hmm. \nASAKAWA And, do you know if anyone\u0092s really died from watching it? \nThe girl flashes a look at her two friends. \nYOUNG GIRL Well, no one that we know, right? \nGirl #2 nods her head. Girl #3 nods slowly, opens and closes her mouth as if deciding whether to say something or not.  The reporter notices. \nASAKAWA What is it? \nGIRL #3 I heard this from a friend of mine in high school.  She said that there was this one girl who watched the video, and then died a week later. She was out on a drive with her boyfriend. \nASAKAWA They were in a wreck? \nGIRL #3 No, their car was parked, but they were both dead inside.  Her boyfriend died because he\u0092d watched the video, too.  That\u0092s what my friend said. \nGirl #3 grows suddenly defensive. \nGIRL #3 (cont\u0092d) It\u0092s true!  It was in the paper two or three days ago. \nASAKAWA Do you know the name of the high school this girl went to? \nGIRL #3 No... I heard this from my friend, and it didn\u0092t happen at her school. She heard it from a friend at a different school, she said. \nINT. NEWS STATION \u0096 DAY \nAsakawa is seated at her DESK.  The station is filled with PEOPLE, scrabbling to meet deadlines.  Komiya walks up to Asakawa\u0092s desk and holds out a MANILA FOLDER. \nKOMIYA Mrs. Asakawa? \n", "test2_true": "KOMIYA Here you are. \nASAKAWA (taking the folder) Thanks. \nKomiya has a seat. \nKOMIYA This same kind of thing happened about ten years ago too, didn\u0092t it? Some popular young singer committed suicide, and then suddenly there was all this talk about her ghost showing up on some music show. \nASAKAWA But I wonder what this rumor\u0092s all about. Everyone you ask always mentions \u0093Izu.\u0094 \nKOMIYA Maybe that\u0092s where it all started. Hey, where was that Kuchi-sake Onna * story from again? \n>* Literally \u0093Ripped-Mouth Lady,\u0094 a kind of ghastly spectre from >Japanese folk stories who wears a veil to hide her mouth, which >has been ripped or cut open from ear to ear. She wanders the >countryside at night asking men \u0093Do you think I\u0092m beautiful?\u0094 then >lowering her veil to reveal her true features. \nASAKAWA Gifu, but there was some big accident out there, and that ended up being what started the rumor. \nKOMIYA A big accident? \nASAKAWA Mmm-hmm.  Something terrible like that is going to stay in people\u0092s minds.  Sometimes the story of what happened gets twisted around, and ends up coming back as a rumor like this one. That\u0092s what they say, at least. \nKOMIYA D\u0092you think something like that happened out at Izu? \nASAKAWA Maybe. Well, anyway, I\u0092m off.  See you tomorrow. \nKOMIYA See you. \nAsakawa gets up from her desk and begins walking towards the exit. She takes only a few steps before noticing a RACK of recent DAILY EDITIONS. \nShe takes one from the rack, sets it on a nearby TABLE.  She begins flipping the pages, and suddenly spies this story: \nSTRANGE AUTOMOBILE DEATH OF YOUNG COUPLE IN YOKOHAMA \nThe bodies of a young man and woman were discovered in their passenger car at around 10 A.M. September 6th.  The location was a vacant lot parallel to Yokohama Prefectural Road.  Local authorities identified the deceased as a 19-year old preparatory school student of Tokyo, and a 16-year old Yokohama resident, a student of a private all-girls\u0092 high school. Because there were no external injuries, police are investigating the possibility of drug-induced suicide... \nJust then two men walk by, a GUY IN A BUSINESS SUIT and a youngish intern named OKAZAKI.  Okazaki is carrying an armload of VIDEOTAPES. \nGUY IN SUIT OK, Okazaki, I\u0092m counting on you. \nOKAZAKI Yessir. \nThe guy in the suit pats Okazaki on the shoulder and walks off. \nOkazaki turns to walk away, spots Asakawa bent over the small table and peering intently at the newspaper article. \nOKAZAKI Miss Asakawa?  I thought you were going home early today. \nAsakawa turns around and begins speaking excitedly. \n", "test2_id": 2488, "test3_input": "She lifts her head up but says nothing as Ryuji walks over to her. \nRYUJI We\u0092ll change.  You\u0092re in no condition to keep this up. \nAsakawa suddenly springs into life.  Her voice is frantic, fearful. \nASAKAWA: No! \nRYUJI Who do you expect to pull up these buckets, then? \nASAKAWA But, we don\u0092t even know if it\u0092s doing any good... \nRyuji strides forward and slaps Asakawa painfully across the cheek. He begins shaking her roughly for good measure. \nRYUJI And what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his mother not coming to pick him up after all? \nHe releases his hold on her.  The two stare at each other a long time, saying nothing. \nCUT to an overhead shot of Asakawa being lowered into the well. CUT now to Asakawa inside the well, her face and clothes covered with grime, body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright. Unable to resist the impulse, Asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder and down into the well.  The dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic. \nRYUJI Don\u0092t look down! \nShe returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward.  CUT to Ryuji leaning over the rim of the well, peering down at her.  For an instant, everything becomes monochrome. It\u0092s not Ryuji looking down at her at all; it\u0092s Professor Ikuma, checking to see if she\u0092s still alive or if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off.  CUT to Asakawa, her eyes wide with fright. \nAsakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well.  A FLASHLIGHT hangs from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness. Asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water. She calls out pleadingly. \nASAKAWA Where are you?  Please, come out. \nAsakawa straightens, unties herself from the rope.  A full bucket already awaits.  She tugs on the rope and Ryuji pulls it up. \nShe scoops up a second bucket, but something stops her from sending it up.  Instead, she begins running her arms through the water again, her voice close to tears. \nASAKAWA Please.  Where are you? \nAsakawa continues her blind fumbling, which sends up little splashes of stagnant water.  With a start, she realizes that her fingers have caught something.  Seaweed?  Asakawa draws her hands close for a better look... and sees that is HAIR.  A thick clump of long, black hair. \nSuddenly a pale, thin ARM shoots out from beneath the water, catching Asakawa just below the wrist.  Asakawa\u0092s ears are filled with a SOUND like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber.  It is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair.  CUT to a shot of Asakawa\u0092s face.  Far from being frightened, her features are oddly placid.  She regards the fearsome thing before her with an almost tender look.  Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long hair. \nASAKAWA It\u0092s you... \nShe strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head with a loud SQUELCH. Revealed is not a face at all but a SKULL.  Its sockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the green SLUDGE it has pulled up from the bottom of the well.  Like a mother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly. Her eyes begin to glaze. \nCUT to Ryuji racing up to the rim of the well, leaning down intently. \nRYUJI Hey!  Asakawa!  It\u0092s already 10 minutes past seven!  We did it! \nDown in the well, Asakawa continues staring blankly ahead.  Her body suddenly falls forward, limp. \nEXT.

His own daughter... \nRYUJI Maybe she wasn\u0092t his daughter at all. \nASAKAWA What? \nRYUJI Maybe her father... wasn\u0092t even human. \nThe two exchange glances.  Ryuji\u0092s gaze falls to Asakawa\u0092s WRIST, which he suddenly takes and holds close to his face.  The ugly bruise where Sadako had grabbed her has disappeared. \nRYUJI It\u0092s gone... \nHe shakes his head, clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal. \nRYUJI Enough, already.  It\u0092s over.  C\u0092mon. I\u0092ll take you home. \nRyuji stands, pulls Asakawa to her feet. \nEXT. OUTSIDE ASKAWA\u0092S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRyuji\u0092s white CAR pulls up into the parking lot.  He and Asakawa get out, regard each other from opposite sides of the car. There is a long moment where neither of them says anything. \nRYUJI Get some rest. \nHe flashes her the slightest of grins. \nRYUJI (cont\u0092d) I still have a thesis to finish. \nCUT to a shot of Ryuji and Asakawa, the car creating an almost metaphoric distance between them. \nASAKAWA ...thank you. \nRyuji nods silently by way of reply.  He gets into his car and drives off.  Asakawa watches him go, and then walks towards the entrance of her apartment. \nINT. ASAKAWA\u0092S APARTMENT \u0096 BEDROOM \u0096 MORNING \nAsakawa walks into her room, sits on the edge of her bed.  It is now morning, and she sits dazedly watching the sun come up. \nINT. RYUJI\u0092S APARTMENT \u0096 MORNING \nRyuji sits busily scribbling into a NOTEBOOK.  He stops writing a moment to regard his notes while taking a sip of COFFEE.  He glances over at his BLACKBOARD for confirmation when a small scowl crosses his brow.  It\u0092s gone a moment later as he chuckles wryly to himself. \nRYUJI That girl... \nRyuji stands, walks over to the blackboard.  He fixes Mai\u0092s little prank with a single chalk stroke. \nEXT.

Typical waiting room. Big sofas and chairs. A table is in the middle of the floor, magazines and pocketbooks. A water jug is in the corner. A ceiling fan is circling fast up above. 
An assortment of men and women of different races and colors. They look mainly middle class. Jennie and Ruby are the youngest people in the room. 
A man in a three-piece suit slowly walks by. Jennie tries to see his face but he is turned the wrong way. Ruby continues to talk. 
The same fat black nurse walks out with a clipboard. She begins to cough tremendously. 
RUBY ... I don't know, I think he's mad at me, but who cares... 
Ruby and Jennie stop talking and look at the black nurse. She is coughing uncontrollably. She looks like a large shaking figure. A skinny nurse walks by, pounds her on the back, and she stops coughing. 
The black nurse has a smile on her face, her eyes watery. She turns and looks at Ruby. 
BLACK NURSE Woowee! It must have been something I ate! (coughs then smiles) Ruby, follow me. 
Ruby stands up and looks at Jennie. Ruby crosses both her fingers and raises them in the air. 
RUBY Wish me luck. 
JENNIE Good luck. 
Ruby follows the black nurse. This should be one long shot, as Ruby follows the nurse through the hectic testing clinic. The two of them enter the same room as before. 
INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY 
The skinny white nurse picks up a folder with Jennie's name on it. She opens the door to the waiting room and looks at Jennie sitting down with her eyes closed. 
WHITE NURSE Jennie. 
Jennie stands up and smiles. She walks towards the door. 
INT. TESTING CLINIC - DAY 
Ruby is sitting down in a chair. The black nurse picks up a file from the back of the door. She opens it and smiles. 
BLACK NURSE (cough, pause) Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections. 
RUBY Yes! 
BLACK NURSE You're clean. 
RUBY Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night. 
BLACK NURSE Now you gotta be careful. 
The black nurse pulls out a bunch of pamphlets. 
BLACK NURSE Here take these pamphlets home and read them. 
INT. TESTING CLINIC - DAY 
Jennie is standing up. She is hugging herself. The white nurse is sitting down at her desk. The nurse looks real closely at the folder and then shuts it. 
WHITE NURSE Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection. 
JENNIE What? 
WHITE NURSE The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should... 
JENNIE I tested positive? 
WHITE NURSE I'm sorry. 
JENNIE But I only had sex with Telly. 
The nurse is quiet.

[Scene Peter's room. He dreams that they're in court, with Rob as their lawyer.] 
JUDGE And now the sentence for these heinous crimes committed against Initech. I hereby sentence you, Michael Bolton and Samir Na...Ananajibad...to a term of no less than four years in federal- pound-me-in-the-ass-prison. Peter Gibbons, you've lead a trite and meaningless life. And you're a very bad person. 
The judge bangs the gavel and Peter wakes up. 
[Scene The living room. Peter is up, feverishly writing a confession. He tears it out and puts it into an envelope with the checks.] 
[Scene Flingers parking lot. Peter sits on the hood of his car, trying to figure out what to do. Joanna comes out.] 
JOANNA Hey. 
PETER Hey. You're not working at Chotchkie's anymore. 
JOANNA No, no, I got fired. 
PETER What happened? 
JOANNA I flipped off my boss. And some customers - actually a line just happened to be standing there, so... 
PETER I'm going to go away for awhile. Uh, to jail. Yea, about that computer scam, you were rightÂ…it was a bad idea. I'm going to take the blame for it, I decided. I'm going to return the money and leave the confession under Lumbergh's door. Joanna, I wanna apologize. I had no right to get pissed off at you, Lumbergh isn't my problem. It wasn't even the right Lumbergh. I don't know why I can't just go to work and be happy, like I'm supposed to like everybody else. 
JOANNA Peter, most people don't like their jobs. But you go out there and find something that makes you happy. 
PETER Yeah. I may never be happy with my job. But if I could be with you, I think that I could be happy with my life. But if you could give it another shot, I promise, Joanna - 
JOANNA Oh shut up. 
They hug and kiss. 
BRIAN Hey, what's going on here? Get a room you two! 
He makes an annoying noise and gives them the finger. 
JOANNA I hate that guy. 
[Scene Initech. Peter drives up.] 
Cut to inside. Peter sticks the envelope under the door of William Lumbergh, Division Vice President. He walks away but frantically runs back and tries to get the envelope. He can't reach it and finally gives up. 
[Scene Initech. Morning. Milton is talking to an secretary. Lumbergh hasn't gotten to work yet.] 
MILTON ...to Mr. Lumbergh and he told me to talk to Payroll and then Payroll, they told me to talk to Mr. Lumbergh. And I still haven't gotten my paycheck and they stole my stapler and they told me to move my desk to Storage Room B and there was garbage all over it and I don't appreciate that.

KIMMY (O.S., sobbing) In here, you bitch! 
Now everybody's really interested.  Julianne ignores them, strides to the stall.  KNOCKS, like it's a door.  No answer. 
JULIANNE Let me in, baby, or I'll rip this damn thing off its non- code-compliant hinges... 
WOMAN (O.S.) GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY FACE OR I'M GONNA MESS YOUR SHIT UP!! 
Some scattered APPLAUSE.  From down the line... 
KIMMY (O.S., still sobbing) Over here, nitwit! 
Oh.  Scattered laughter.  Julianne moves down the line.  Stares at the door.  We hear the soft, muted crying from within.  Slowly, Julianne... 
... drops to her knees.  Bends her head low.  PEERS under the door. What she sees, prompts a sad warning... 
JULIANNE Incoming. 
And she crawls UNDER the door, on her belly.  We go WITH her to see... 
... Kim fully dressed, perched on the closed toilet lid, her knees drawn up, her arms around them. 
JULIANNE Pitiful. 
And pulls herself up to her knees.  Kimmy tries to glare, but it just isn't in her. 
KIMMY Haven't you done enough? 
The world gets real quiet.  An entire bathroom is listening. Julianne cocks her head to one side. 
JULIANNE In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish. 
KIMMY WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART? 
JULIANNE Have you ever heard of. Irony? 
Irony? Kimmy sniffles. 
JULIANNE I threw my arms around your husband.  And kissed him with all my heart.  Because I was so happy.  For you.  Nitwit. 
And leans close.  As Kimmy flinches. 
JULIANNE (whispers) He's going to take... (big grin) The job! 
A stunned pole-axed moment.  And Kimmy's eyes SPRING open.  You mean...? 
JULIANNE (beaming) With your dad, yeah.  Can you guess why?  Bitch? 
Everything inside Kimmy BURSTS free in a torrent of tears... 
KIMMY HE LOVES ME!! 
And DISSOLVES, sobbing, into Julianne's arms.  A beat, for Julianne to reflect, and then she strokes her tenderly. 
JULIANNE Well, of course, he loves you. 
Kisses the top of Kimmy's head. 
JULIANNE (very soft) Hell, even I love you. 
Kimmy holds her tight.  From her heart... 
JULIANNE I never want to go through this again. 
KIMMY That's entirely understandable. 
ANGLES... outside the stall.  Julianne's feet sticking out under the door. 
KIMMY (O.S.) Shit!  THE TIME! 
The two BURST out of the stall, hand-in-hand, at a desperate DEAD RUN past us.  HEAR them EXPLODE out the door, and... 
... five stalls OPEN.  Women exit, crying. 
EXT.  UNIVERSITY CHAPEL - TWILIGHT 
A taxi pulls up in front of an ivy-covered CHAPEL, fronted by nearly a hundred souls, milling about in attitude ranging from overstimulated curiosity to clinical hyperanxiety.  Our girls JUMP out of the cab, and half the crowd starts running toward us, twins in the lead... 
SAMMY Whatever hap... 
JULIANNE (cutting this short) We were bonding, we lost track, we're officially sorry, now let's put it behind us. 
Kim WAVES at her mom by the chapel entrance.  And takes Julianne's hand for support. 
JULIANNE Believe me, we got a bride who's worth waiting for, yes? 
Everybody nods. 
JULIANNE Out of our way. 
EXT.  DRESSING ROOM - TWILIGHT 
White.  Pure blinding white.  Across FRAME floats more white, this gauzy and ethereal.  It settles, its roots planting deeply in the bride's hair.  TILTS UP to... 
... the face of the woman who placed it there.  Julianne's eyes, appraising this bride we cannot see.  And so softly... 
JULIANNE Don't worry, sugar. 
Don't worry. 
JULIANNE When he looks at you, it will be as if... 
The words stronger.  Because there is no smile.

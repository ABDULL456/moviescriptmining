The cop pulls out a Breathalyzer and holds it up to Greg's mouth. 
MARK Wait, officer. Don't do that. 
COP I don't think you can afford my bribe, son. 
MARK How much does it cost to bribe you? 
COP At least five grand. 
MARK AND GREG Wow, that's high. 
COP I need to feel that I've got some sense of integrity. 
Greg blows in the Breathalyzer. 
COP Whoa, that's off the charts. Step out of the car, son. You're drunk and going to jail. 
Greg opens the door. 
MARK Wait. (PAUSE) He's not drunk. 
Greg stumbles and falls, passing out in the dirt. The cop stares at Mark for a long beat while his brain wraps around this. 
COP Oh. 
The cop bangs his Breathalyzer against his leg. 
COP Damn thing must be broken. 
In the background we can hear Greg vomiting profusely. The cop picks up Greg and puts him back in the driver's seat. 
COP (to Greg) Son, you might want to drive yourself to the nearest hospital. You have food poisoning or some kind of flu. 
Mark is basically passed out, vomit drooling down his chin. He couldn't look more drunk. The cop and Mark stare at him for a beat. 
COP (to Mark) Maybe you oughta drive, son. 
MARK Good idea. 
MOMENTS LATER 
Driving away with Greg in the passenger seat, a giant smile comes across Mark's face as he begins to laugh. 
MARK That was awesome! 
GREG Stop laughing, I'm sick. 
MARK You're gonna be all right, Greg. 
GREG Oh good! 
Greg vomits all over himself. 
GREG Stupid stomach flu. (PAUSE) Where are we going? 
MARK Vegas, baby. Vegas. 
EXT. BELLAGIO - NIGHT 
Mark pulls in front of the Bellagio hotel and casino. Both Mark, and a very hungover looking Greg, pop out of the car. Mark hands the keys to the valet and they both stumble inside. 
INT. BELLAGIO - NIGHT 
It's the Bellagio. We've all been there. 
GREG What are we doing here? We don't have any money to throw away. 
MARK Sure we do. 
Mark pulls out a small wad of money. 
GREG What is that, a few hundred bucks? That's not going to last us very long. 
MARK Sure it will. 
Mark and Greg step up to the chip counter. Mark slides his small wad through the window. 
MARK Chips please.

VICTOR Sparky? Sparky? 
Victor pushes open the gate. His flashlight casts long, scary shadows. 
He is drawn towards Sparky's grave and as his flashlight sweeps across the tombstone, he sees Sparky's frightened face peeking out from behind. 
Could it be... 
VICTOR Sparky? 
Sparky peers around the edge of the tombstone and realizes that it's Victor and hangs his head in shame. 
VICTOR Sparky! 
Sparky is nervous and confused but slowly rests his head in Victor's arms. 
VICTOR Sparky it's OK boy, it's just me. I thought that you were gone. I never want to lose you. Promise you'll never go running off. Okay? 
Victor hold him tightly and Sparky licks him happily. 
VICTOR Come on boy. 
Victor leads Sparky away through the cemetery when he sees the open grave of Shelley and the Colossus mausoleum door ajar. 
VICTOR Was someone else here? 
EXT. CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS 
Bob runs past the pet cemetery and hides behind a mail box to avoid the phalanx of sea monkeys who charge past like supernatural hooligans, craving mayhem and destructive mischief. 
Panting with relief, Bob turns to see Victor in the cemetery.

BOB Victor! I need your help. 
VICTOR Did you see those things? They were like.... 
BOB Sea Monkeys. You know how on the package, they're like in a happy kingdom and everyone's smiling? 
VICTOR Yeah. 
BOB They're not like that at all. 
Toshiaki runs up, yelling from the sidewalk. 
TOSHIAKI Victor!     I need your help! 
BOB I asked him first! 
TOSHIAKI My problem's bigger! 
Toshiaki points to the distance - a towering, giant Turtle is walking past. Its a suburban Gamera. Sparky barks defensively. 
Bob has to admit -- 
BOB Yeah.    He's right. 
A beat. Victor has to think fast. This is all his fault. 
He looks down at Sparky and gets an idea. 
VICTOR Ok let's go! 
Victor, Sparky and Bob rush off. Toshiaki starts to laugh and reveals his video recorder. He is secretly quite pleased with his science project.

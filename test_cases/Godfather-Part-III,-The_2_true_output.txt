CONTLVIIED 
SAN'TINO I'm still young enough to whip your ass. As x'rankie starts to rise, Hagen puts a stop to any further discussion. 
HAGR"`N All-right. That's it. 
(THEN) We all agree -- except Santino -- that what Tony proposes is possible although not. easy. 
(THEN) Of course, financial arrangements will have to be worked out -- 
TONY There's no problem there. Every- thing will be handled through me and in cash. 
HAGZN You can tell your friends that they have a deal. 
TONY. Good. 
SAGE Tell them this too --- what the Corleone family wants for its part in this operation is the uncondi- tional pardon of Danny DeVito. And that will have to come first. 
TONY I don't know if they'll accept that. 
RAGE It's a non-negotiable condition. 
(THHEN) We'll start getting things lined up, but we won't move until Danny walks out of Leavenworth.

EXT. CAMP PEARY, VIRGINIA - DAY 
Camp Peary is the clandestine training facility of the CIA, under military cover. It is near Williams- burg, Virginia, a couple of hours drive from. Washington. .cwa by the official cryptonym "ISOLATION" it is un- officially called The Farla" - The enormous, thickly-wooded area is divided intern- ally into tightly controlled training areas. A high chaintlink._fence topped with barbed wire surrounds the base. Signs an it read: "U.S. GOVE.SNMENT RESER- 
VATION. NO TRESPASSING." We are presently on such a sign. We hold for a moment as we hear ---- 
INSTRUCTOR'S VOICE A doomsday car is a vehicle which is loaded with a high explosive, such as gelignite, and left in an area where it will do the most dam- age when detonated -- 
EXT. TRAINING AEA (CAMP P_.ARY) - DAY. 
We are on the Instructor, a lean, mean-lacking A=Y Sergeant is impeccable fatigues. His manner of speech is Southern.

( C O N T I N U ED) 
CCNT NUED : Although he doesn't answer the Instructor, we can read something less than total approval on his face. 
INSTAUC'R'OR In view of the fact that we're getting our butts kicked rosey all over the world, it might behoove us to take a lesson from the IRA and the PLO. 
(THEN) Now, the first thing those boys'l1 do when they aim to spread a little unhappiness in the ranks of the righteous, is steal a motor vehicle -- 
(THEN) You know how to steal a motor vehicle, Mister Adams?

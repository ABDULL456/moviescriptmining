erek and Beth confer with Reyes.       Beth is very agitated. 
REYES Apparently Lisa stole her sister's ID to buy a ticket and board a plane to LA earlier today, then used her sister's credit card to rent a car. The sister didn't even know she was gone until a few hours ago. She said Lisa had been doing well in therapy. She didn't know she checked herself out this morning... 
BETH (EMPHATIC) She was in our house -- alone with our son. 
DEREK he doctor says he's fine. 
BETH Well, I'm not fine. to Reyes; demanding) I want you to find her. 
REYES We will. She violated the restraining order so we can arrest her. Look, Mrs. Charles, I know you're upset. I'm a mother, too... 
BETH How would you feel if it was your child? 
REYES Exactly the same as you.

CONTINUED: 
BETH Find her. 
Beth goes back into the examining room to join Kyle. 
DEREK Now what? Am I supposed to go out and buy a gun or something? 
REYES She didn't physically harm him. 
DEREK No, but she could have. Is that the message she's trying to send? R EYES Either that or...maybe she was trying to show you she could love him. off Derek's sickened reaction) People like Lisa... their emotions can turn on a dime. What you don't want is her feelings for you to change to rage. I don't know. But there's a good chance she'll try to get in touch. If she does, you need to call me right away. Meanwhile, you might want to beef up your home security. 
erek nods.

Kyle is asleep as Derek tucks him in.    Beth CRIES OUT from another part of the house. 
BETH Derek! 
Derek races out of the room. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM 
The bedroom has been trashed. The bed has been stripped. The ceiling mirror is now a spider-webs of cracks. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The closet is open and clothes are strewn about. Derek discovers Beth on her knees, holding up a family photograph in which Beth's head has been torn off. 
BETH She never left.   She was here the whole time. 
Beth scrambles over and finds a wedding photo of herself and Derek. Again, her head has been removed. B ETH (cont'd) What kind of sick person... 
Derek crouches down and holds Beth who begins to cry, her body shaking. 
DEREK It's all right, it's all right... 
BETH No Derek! It's not all right!!! We have to do something. We can't live like this. 
As he holds his wife, Derek looks up and sees their reflection in the mirror -- twisted and distorted, like Lisa's mind.

CHINGACHGOOK Leave them. 
Heyward stops. Hawkeye and Uncas follow Chingachgook, leaving the cabin. 
CORA (hasn't moved) Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial! 
HAWKEYE (shaking his head) Let us go, miss. 
CORA I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference. 
Hawkeye turns back and rapidly approaches her. She takes a step back, fearful. 
HAWKEYE (contained) Miss Munro. (pause) They are not strangers .... And they stay as they lay ...! 
CORA 
realizes Hawkeye knew these people and is deeply affected. She also realizes for the first time this is a whole new world with dynamics and complexities, behavior and rhythms she doesn't understand. He turns away from her and walks on. She hesitates a moment. 
WIDE ON THE SMALL CLEARING IN FRONT OF THE FARMHOUSE 
as Chingachgook and Hawkeye, extremely alert and cradling their cocked flintlocks, walk to camera, eyes sweeping the forest perimeter; they're followed by Cora, Heyward helping Alice and Uncas as rearguard. 
The ruined cabin and the dead dream of a family smolders behind them. 
CUT TO ... 
EXTERIOR GLADE - PROFILE: HAWKEYE - NIGHT 
moves through to where the trees seem sparse and are unnaturally white birch and some thin grass grows. The land rises into a mound. Chingachgook and the others avoid stepping on the grass and cross to the other side of it. 
CHINGACHGOOK 
mutters something to Uncas. He nods and disappears amongst the white birch, soundlessly. 
HAWKEYE 
throws Heyward a blanket. Heyward spreads the blanket below the top of the mound and - maintaining silence - he gestures for Cora & Alice to rest there. 
ALICE'S HEAD 
hits the blanket. She curls into a fetal position and she's out. Heyward is nearby on watch. Hawkeye has taken a position two-thirds of the way around the crescent shaped mound. Cora has sought him out. 
HAWKEYE 
doesn't react as Cora enters. He's scanning the trees; not looking at her. They whisper ... 
CORA Why didn't you bury those people? 
HAWKEYE Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing ... 
CORA You knew them. 
Hawkeye looks at her and nods. 
CORA (stiffly) You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you. 
HAWKEYE Well that is to be expected. My father ... 
CORA Your "father"? 
HAWKEYE Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you. 
CORA He did? 
HAWKEYE Yes. He said ... "do not try to make them understand you." 
CORA What?! 
HAWKEYE Yes. And "do not try to understand them. That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense ..." 
Cora's indignation is cut off because ... 
UNCAS 
moving fast. He gestures back the way he came and it means they're in jeopardy. Uncas disappears around the mound. 
CUT TO ... 
EXTERIOR BIRCH FOREST - TREES - NIGHT 
Nothing. Imperceptibly we move closer and start to see shapes blocking out part of the white birch. 
RED-PAINTED FACE 
white eyes. A ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back of the large man's head. Slit and monstrously elongated earlobes are weighted with silver. He's followed by others. Wary, silently, they hunt. 
DEEPER: MORE OTTAWA 
Towards the rear are two French Rangers ("Coureurs des Bois") from Le Regiment de la Sarre. They're bearded, dirty, dressed Indian-style in moccasins, leggings and breechcloths with hooded hunting shirts. There's nothing clumsy about them. They're the 18th century version of Special Forces who've gone indigenous. If they and the Ottawa find our people, it's all over. 
ALICE 
seeing the red-painted Ottawa approach, starts to panic. Her hyperventilating and involuntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position. A hand covers her mouth and silences her struggling. WIDEN. It's Uncas. His other arm is around her, holding her, looking towards the advancing Ottawa.

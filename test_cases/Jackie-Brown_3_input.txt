Jackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records leaned up against the wall on the floor. 
JACKIE I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair. 
MAX It looks nice. 
She finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the album from the sleeve, and places it on her stereo turntable. 
MAX (CONT'D) You never got into the whole CD revolution? 
JACKIE I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records. 
The song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number from the early seventies. 
MAX Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on records. 
Jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table. 
JACKIE I don't buy new stuff that often. 
Jackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max. She lights a cigarette and stands. 
Max listens to the soul song. 
MAX This is pretty. 
JACKIE Uh-huh. 
MAX Who is this? 
JACKIE The Delfonics. 
MAX 
JACKIE '74, I think. 
MAX It's nice. 
They listen for a moment. 
JACKIE I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available. 
MAX Are you? 
JACKIE I don't know yet. 'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens. 
MAX What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you. 
JACKIE I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money. 
MAX Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point. 
JACKIE It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin in. 
MAX How'd you find that out? 
JACKIE He told me last night. 
MAX He called you? 
JACKIE He came by. 
MAX What?... What'd you do? 
JACKIE We talked. 
Jackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee's almost there, but not quite. She pulls down two mugs from a cabinet. 
JACKIE (CONT'D) He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can. 
MAX Why? 
JACKIE He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar? 
MAX No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out. 
She pours the coffee. 
JACKIE Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever used. He can't trust his other people. They're crooks. He can try bringing I in himself, but Ordell sure don't want to go through no Customs line. Either he recruits another Cabo stewardess, or he continues to trust me. I made him feel he still can. 
Jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and sits down. 
MAX How do you get it out? 
JACKIE Same way I been don', but first they got to let me go back to work. 
MAX You're gonna offer to set him up? 
JACKIE If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em. 
MAX It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody. 
JACKIE I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again. 
Max watches her a moment 
Jackie takes a drink of coffee. 
JACKIE (CONT'D) How do you feel about getting old? 
MAX You're not old. You look great. 
JACKIE I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you? 
MAX It's not really something I think about. 
JACKIE Really? 
MAX Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it. 
JACKIE How'd you feel about it? 
MAX I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me. 
JACKIE It's different with men. 
MAX You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department. 
Jackie smiles. 
MAX (CONT'D) In fact, I'd make a bet that except possibly for an Afro - you look exactly the same as you did at twenty nine. 
Jackie smiles into her coffee. 
JACKIE My ass ain't the same. 
MAX Bigger? 
JACKIE Yeah.

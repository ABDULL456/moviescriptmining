Krebbs:  Ooo... a lovely ladies' purse. 
Frank:   (crying) I don't want to go as a purse.  (begging) Please, please, don't let 'em do it! 
Cody:    Don't worry, we're gonna get out of here. 
Frank:   We are? 
Cody:    Yeah!  If we all put our heads together, I'm sure we'll think of something. 
Frank:   Yeah, something, something.... (begins to pant and think hard) 
Cody:    Frank, what's wrong? 
Krebbs:  Oh, here he goes again. 
Red:     Take it easy mate, you don't want to hurt yourself again. 
Frank:   (straining to think) I got it!!  All we gotta do, is get the keys!! 
Krebbs:  (sarcastically) Ohhh!! Is that all??  Well then, we better start packing our bags. 
Cody:    No wait, he's right.  If we could get these long pieces of wood.... (Cody strains to reach some long pieces of wood through his cage) 
Frank:   Wood, yeah, wood, wood, wood, yeah good. 
Cody:    Maybe we could.... (a bird in a "tire cage" helps knock the wood so Cody can reach it.)  that's right just a little more... there, (he gets a piece of wood) Come on everybody, get some more stuff!! 
Red:     The kid's right, what are we waiting for?

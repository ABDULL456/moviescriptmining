KALE I didn't peg you as a conformist. 
Ashley glares, furious. She picks up the DV cam and binoculars, approaches Kale, hands them over with: 
ASHLEY Try to keep these in your drawers tonight, will ya? 
Ashley leaves.      A sullen Kale stares after her --

PRELAP - CROWD WALLA and THWUMPING MUSIC. 
67   INT. DAD'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING                                    67 
Kale sits in the darkness at dad's desk. He's on the phone, pressing his other finger to his ear, trying to drown out the NOISE emanating from Ashley's party next door. 
Kale, on phone, gets Ronnie's VOICE MAIL. 
RONNIE (phone filter) This is Ronnie, leave a message. 
Kale slams the phone down, sits there a beat.     JUMP CUT: 
- The white pages THWUMP onto the desk.     JUMP CUT: 
- Kale on the phone: 
KALE (into phone) Yeah, I'm calling about the Jeep Cherokee that was brought in with the flat and the stripped lug -- it's ready? Listen, did they have to replace the whole tire -- they patched it? Is there any way to tell if it was slashed or -- But a nail usually acts like its own plug for awhile, doesn't it? I mean it's a really slow leak, it can't flatten a tire in twenty minutes. (beat as Kale listens) -- Yeah, I guess anything's possible. 
A ROAR of LAUGHTER O.S. makes Kale jump from his chair.       He grabs the binoculars, heads to the window. 
BINOCULAR POV - Kale scans the crowd until he finds Ashley, talking with a group of PARTYGOERS. She pretends to listen to one of the guy's stories as she furtively glances toward Kale's window. But it's quick. We can't be a hundred percent sure if it was on purpose. 
KALE (CONT'D) Wait, what was that? You think I'm watching? Well, I'm not... Nope, I am minding my own business... 
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley excuses herself from the group and approaches the drink and food table where MINNIE TYCO (a.k.a. "Skinny Psycho") is standing, nitpicking over her snack choices. Ashley hugs her then taps the cute GUY next to her on the shoulder. The guy turns around.

Ashley mouths "Oh my God" like he's some long lost lover. Ashley hugs the surprised guy who wastes no time in hugging her back. 
KALE (CONT'D) You think I'm buying that? 
Kale keeps watching. 
KALE (CONT'D) I'm not biting -- 
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley glances up in Kale's direction again -- it's more obvious this time as she keeps HUGGING THE GUY. 
KALE (CONT'D) That's it. 
Kale tosses the binoculars, heads out. 
68   EXT. 2ND FL PORCH - EVENING - SHORT TIME LATER                      68 
Kale SLAMS a ladder up against the roof. 
69   EXT. ROOF - EVENING - SECONDS LATER                                 69 
Kale SLAMS a speaker down on the edge of the roof facing Ashley's. Makes sure the speaker wires are securely clamped in place, then unwinds the roll of wire back across the roof toward the ladder... JUMP CUT: 
70   INT. 2ND FL PORCH - EVENING - SECONDS LATER                         70 
Kale runs the wire down the hall... 
71   INT. DAD'S OFFICE - EVENING - MOMENTS LATER                         71 
SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS: 
CU - Kale's hand flips on dad's bookshelf amplifier, CRANKS THE VOLUME CONTROL KNOB. 
CU - Kale's I-POD LCD SCREEN lights up.    His thumb hovers over the PLAY button. 
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley's party comes into focus. 
Kale presses play. The speaker EXPLODES with the ROAR OF BARRY MANILOW (or AIR SUPPLY). 
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley's party comes to a grinding halt. 
Kale PANS AROUND, picks up Ashley again. Glaring. Fire in her eyes as she storms O.S. Kale smiles with perverse

satisfaction as he tilts his head, anticipating the doorbell to ring. Another beat, then -- DING DONG. 
72   INT. ENTRY HALL - EVENING - SECONDS LATER                          72 
Kale descends the stairs, maintaining his wicked grin. He opens the door for Ashley, but instead -- gets PELTED WITH A BARRAGE OF WATER BALLOONS.

I use it every day. \nYusuf hands it to Cobb, who considers the white liquid inside. \nCOBB For what? \nYusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy, to a METAL DOOR. He STOPS- second thoughts. \nYUSUF Perhaps... you will not want to see. \nCobb motions to continue. Yusuf pulls out a large key. \nINT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS \nA dark room with ROWS of low COTS. Each with a sleeping occupant. Tubes connect their wrists. An ELDERLY BALD MAN watches over them. \nEAMES (counting) Eighteen, twenty-all connected, bloody hell. \nYUSUF They come every day. To share the dream. \nYusuf nods at the Elderly Bald Man, who moves to the nearest bed. Reaches out to the OCCUPANT. Gives his face a FIRM SLAP. The sleeper does not even stir. \nYUSUF See? Very stable. \nCOBB How long do they dream? \nYUSUF Three, four hours. Every day. \nCOBB How long in dream time? \nYUSUF With this compound... about forty hours. Each and every day. \nSaito surveys the room, appalled. \nSAITO Why do they do it? \nYUSUF Tell him, Mr. Cobb. \nCOBB After a while... (looks at Saito) It becomes the only way you can dream. \nYUSUF Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb? \nCobb STARES at the sleepers. Uneasy. \nEAMES They come here every day to sleep? \nELDERLY BALD MAN (O.S.) No. \nCobb turns to the Elderly Bald Man, who looks fondly at his dreamers. \nELDERLY BALD MAN They come to be woken up... the dream has become their reality... \nThe Elderly Bald Man pokes a crooked finger at Cobb's chest. \nELDERLY BALD MAN And who are you to say otherwise? \nCobb STARES at the Elderly Bald Man. DISTURBED. Cobb turns to Yusuf. TOSSES him the bottle. \nCOBB Let's see what you can do. \nINT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER \nCobb is lying on an empty cot, asleep. Yusuf stands over him. As we move in on Cobb's SLEEPING FACE we hear the sound of a FREIGHT TRAIN, BUILDING, and we- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WASTELAND - DAY \nCLOSE ON Cobb's face as he lies, EYES CLOSED, cheek pressed to a METAL RAIL- THE SOUND OF THE TRAIN IS DEAFENING- Cobb is BREATHING, BREATHING, BREATHING, and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - DAY \nCobb's eyes open. Yusuf is watching him. \nYUSUF Sharp, no? \nCobb nods. Gets to his feet, looking around- \nINT. BATHROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS \nCobb SPLASHES water on his face, breathing hard- INSERT CUT: A CURTAIN BILLOWS. MAL TURNS TO US, HAIR BLOWING, SMILING. Cobb fumbles in his pockets, pulls out his spinning top. He tries to set it spinning on the back edge of the sink, but it FALLS to the floor and rolls towards the door- Saito is there. WATCHING Cobb. He looks down at the spinning top. \nSAITO Everything alright, Mr. Cobb? \nCobb dries his face with a paper towel. Picks up his top. \nCOBB Everything's fine. \nINT. BACK ROOM, WORKSHOP - NIGHT \nClose on a small BRASS CHESS PIECE. Ariadne tips it over. Frowning, she picks up a micro drill, peels back the felt on the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its base. Tests the TIPPING POINT again. A NOISE makes her look up. \nINT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS \nAriadne comes into the main space. Someone is there, unpacking one of the MECHANISMS. Cobb. \nARIADNE You're back. \nCobb looks up with a start. Caught out. \nARIADNE Are you going under on your own? \nCOBB I just-I need to test some things. I didn't realize anyone was here. \nARIADNE Just working on my totem. \nAriadne holds up the chess piece. Cobb reaches for it. \nCOBB Let me see- \nAriadne SNAPS it out of his reach. Smiles. Cobb nods. \nCOBB You're learning. \n", "test1_true": "COBB No. Mal's. \nCobb pulls out his spinning top. Looks at it. \nCOBB This one was hers. She'd spin it in a dream and it would never topple. Just spin and spin... \nARIADNE Arthur told me she died. \nCOBB She did. How are the mazes coming? \nAriadne indicates three large ARCHITECTURAL MODELS. \nARIADNE Good. Each level relates to the part of the subject's subconscious we're trying to access. I'm making the bottom level a hospital, so that Fischer will bring his father there- \nCOBB Don't tell me. Remember, you only want the dreamer to know the layout. \nARIADNE Why's that so important? \nCOBB In case one of us brings in part of our subconscious. You wouldn't want any projections knowing the layout. \nARIADNE In case you bring Mal in. \nCobb says nothing. \nARIADNE You won't build yourself because if you know the maze, then she knows it. And she'd sabotage the operation. You can't keep her out, can you? \nCobb says nothing. \nARIADNE Do the others know? \nCOBB No. \nARIADNE You have to warn them if it's getting worse- \nCOBB (gentle) I didn't say it's getting worse. Look, Ariadne, I need them for this job. I need you for this job. Without your help, I'll never get back to my children. And that's all I can care about right now. \nARIADNE Why can't you go home, Cobb? \nCobb looks at her, deciding what to say. \nCOBB They think I killed her. \nARIADNE How did she die? \nCobb thinks. \nINSERT CUT: Mal, wind BLOWING her hair, smiles at Cobb. Now we see Cobb- SHAKING HIS HEAD, TEARS STREAMING, BEGGING- COBB Thank you. \nARIADNE For what? \nCOBB Not asking whether I did. \nINT. WORKSHOP - DAY \nAriadne, Arthur, Yusuf, Eames and Saito sit around the room, looking at FILES. Cobb presides. \nCOBB The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to the Australian energy conglomerate, Fischer Morrow. \nCobb opens a large presentation pad. \nCOBB (reads aloud) \"I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S EMPIRE.\" \nCobb turns to the team. \nCOBB An idea Robert Fischer's conscious mind would never accept. We have to plant it deep in his subconscious. \nARTHUR How deep? \nCOBB Three levels down. \nARTHUR A dream within a dream within a dream? Is that even possible? \nCOBB Yes. It is. \nCOBB Now, the subconscious motivates through emotion, not reason, so we have to translate the idea into an emotional concept. \nARTHUR How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion? \nCOBB That's what we have to figure out. Robert and his father have a tense relationship. Worse, even, than the gossip columns have suggested... \nEAMES Do you play on that? Suggest breaking up his father's company as a 'screw you' to the old man? \nCOBB No. Positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time. We yearn for people to be reconciled, for catharsis. We need positive emotional logic. \nEames thinks. Paces. Looking back at the board. \nEAMES Try this... \"MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS.\" \nCOBB That might work. \nARTHUR Might? We'll have to do better than that. \nEAMES Thanks for the contribution, Arthur. \nARTHUR Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames. \nCOBB Inception's not about specificity. When we get inside his head, we're going to have to work with what we find. \nArthur shrugs, frustrated. And we- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY \nThe team are in the middle of a DESERTED intersection. Ariadne is showing Yusuf aspects of the geography. \nEAMES We could split the idea into emotional triggers, and use one on each level. \nCOBB How do you mean? \nEAMES On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father.... Say: \"I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS.\" Next level down we've accessed his ambition and self-esteem. We feed him: \"I WILL CREATE SOMETHING MYSELF.\" Then, the bottom level, we bring out the emotional big guns... \nCOBB \"MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE HIM.\" \nEAMES That could do it. \nARTHUR How do you produce these emotional triggers? \nEAMES I forge each emotional concept in the style and manner of Peter Browning, a key figure in Fischer's emotional life. \n", "test1_id": 2127, "test2_input": "COBB What did he add? \nAriadne looks at Cobb. \nARIADNE I shouldn't tell you. If Mal- \nCOBB There's no time-what did he add? \nARIADNE Utility closets, trap doors... \nCOBB What about service features? Did he add any large pipes or- \nARIADNE Ducts. He added an air duct system- it doesn't follow the maze. They can use it to go straight from the outer walls to the upper tower. \nCOBB Explain it to them. \nARIADNE (into radio) Saito? \nEXT.

FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS \nEames shoots out of the trees, then FALLS to the snow as he sees a great CRACKING up ahead- the SLOPE IS FALLING AWAY IN AN AVALANCHE- \nEXT. CLIFF FACE BEHIND COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS \nSaito hears the RUMBLE above them. He looks down, Fischer is below, near the bottom of the sheer face- \nSAITO Look out! \nSaito CUTS the rope- they FALL- HIT the icy face and SLIDE down the slope, clearing the path of the avalanche- and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT.

I figure Arthur's got a couple minutes and we've got about twenty. \nCobb and Ariadne MOVE towards the base of the complex. \nEXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS \nSaito and Fischer RUN around the base of the building. They find a large EXHAUST PORT. Lay a charge on the GRILL. They blow the charge.

DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS \nSaito and Fischer hurry through the duct system. Saito is falling behind, coughing up blood. \nEXT. UPPER TERRACE, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS \nCobb GRABS a Security Guard from behind, strangling him unconscious. He beckons to Ariadne, covering her as she runs towards him. They enter the base of the south tower. \nINT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS \nA guard is manning the tower. Cobb and Ariadne enter- Cobb SHOOTS the guard and moves to the window. \nARIADNE (she points) That's the antechamber outside the strongroom. \nCobb looks at the large windows of the antechamber. \nCOBB What about the strongroom? Doesn't it have any windows? \nARIADNE Wouldn't be very strong if it did. (off look) Look, if you wanted to design it yourself- \nCOBB It's fine. Better hope that we like what Fischer finds in there. \nCobb sets up his sniper rifle. Through the scope he can see three guards on the balcony outside the chamber. Three more inside. Cobb casually picks them off with his rifle. Ariadne watches through binoculars, appalled. \nARIADNE These projections, they're part of his subconscious? \nCOBB Yeah. \nARIADNE Are you destroying those parts of his mind? \nCOBB No, of course not. They're just projections. \nEAMES (OVER RADIO) Cobb? Something's wrong? \nEXT.

DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - DAY \nSaito and Fischer approach the grate covering the exit to the anteroom. Saito SLUMPS to the floor of the duct, pulls out his radio.

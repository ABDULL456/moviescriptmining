{"train": "INT. HALL, JAPANESE CASTLE-CONTINUOUS \nCobb SLIPS through the shadows towards a GUARD stationed at the head of a GRAND STAIRCASE... \nThe Guard HEARS something- TURNS- PEERS into the shadows... \nCobb FLASHES out of the shadows, silenced pistol up, AIMING- \nPHHT- head shot- the Guard starts to drop... but Cobb is already there to CATCH him, sliding on his knees and lowering the Guard SILENTLY to the floor. \nINT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS \nCobb moves to a PAINTING. With practiced hands he removes it from the wall, revealing a SAFE. Cobb spins the dial, pulls it OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it into his waistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVELOPE. \nLIGHTS COME ON. Cobb freezes. \nSAITO (O.S.) Turn around. \nCobb turns. At the far end of the room: Saito. Next to him is Mal, gun in hand. She smiles at Cobb. \nMAL The gun, Dom. \nCobb doesn't move. Mal motions outside- two GUARDS drag Arthur into the room. Mal puts the gun to his head. \nMAL Please. \nCobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then SLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to rest HALFWAY down the length or the table. \nSAITO Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb. \nCobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the envelopes, SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, hands raised. \nCOBB Did she tell you, or have you known all along? \nSAITO That you're here to steal from me? (beat) Or that we're actually asleep? \nArthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look. \nSAITO I want to know who your employer is. \nMal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple. \nCOBB No point threatening him in a dream. \nMAL That depends on what you're threatening. Killing him would just wake him up... but pain? Pain is in the mind... \nMal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the leg- Arthur drops, SCREAMING- Mal looks at Cobb, cold. \nMAL And, judging by the decor, we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur? \nCobb watches Arthur's PAIN. Mal aims at Arthur's other leg... \nCobb SPRINGS for the table, SKIDDING along its polished surface- he GRABS his gun- SHOOTS ARTHUR BETWEEN THE EYES- \nArthur DROPS- the room starts to SHUDDER in a MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE- Cobb SPRINGS for the door- Arthur's eyes stare at the ceiling, DEAD, and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY \nArthur's EYES OPEN as he WAKES IN THE ARMCHAIR- he GRABS at the tubes at his wrist, YANKING them free- \nNASH What're you doing?! It's too soon- \nFLUID spurts from the tubes as Arthur STRUGGLES with the SILVER CASE on the bathroom floor. \nARTHUR I know! We have to reconnect the loop before they wake up! \nArthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the bedroom- following the tubes to where they meet Saito's wrist- SAITO LIES ON THE BED ASLEEP. Saito STIRS and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. JAPANESE CASTLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nCobb LURCHES towards the stairs, as all around him the building BUCKS and HEAVES- \nINT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS \nSaito and the Guards PANIC. Mal walks calmly through the destruction, picks up the envelope and turns to Saito. \nMAL He was close. Very close. \nEXT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS \nCobb runs up the stairs, pulling out the SECOND ENVELOPE- \nINT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS \nSaito RIPS open the envelope, pulls out sheets of paper. He looks at Mal, PANICKED. He turns to the Guards- \nSAITO Stop him! \nMal, confused, looks at the sheets of paper: THEY ARE BLANK. Mal smiles, amused. \nINT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS \nAs Cobb runs up the stairs he reads the TYPEWRITTEN SHEETS from his envelope, and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nArthur OPENS the silver case: a COMPLEX MECHANISM of TUBES, SYRINGES, DOSAGE CONTROLLERS. Arthur's hands fly across the machine's controls as he glances at Saito's STIRRING face- \nARTHUR I'm not going to make it! Wake Cobb! \nINT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nNash turns to Cobb. Raises his hand and SMACKS him across the face, and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT \nCobb is SMASHED sideways off his feet... \nINT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT \nThe CEILING CRACKS above Saito- he looks up as a TON of STONE floods down, CRUSHING HIM and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nIn the distant background, strange MASSIVE low-end MUSICAL start, sounding like DISTANT HORNS... \nSAITO So leave me and go. \nCOBB You know the corporation who hired us won't accept failure. We won't last two days... \nThe DISTANT, SLOWED-DOWN MUSIC is becoming LOUDER, as are the SHOUTS coming up the stairs. Arthur looks at his watch, its SLOW SECOND TICKING MARKS TIME WITH THE MASSIVE MUSIC. \nARTHUR Come on, Cobb. \nCOBB So now I have to do this the old- fashioned way- \nCobb GRABS SAITO AND PUTS HIS HEAD TO THE FLOOR, gun pressed into his cheek. Saito looks into Cobb's eyes- sees he will pull the trigger. Saito BLINKS, looks away in shame- \nWhen he NOTICES SOMETHING. And starts LAUGHING. \nSAITO I've always hated this carpet. \nCobb's eyes flick to the carpet and back. \nSAITO It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways... \nCobb looks up at Nash, who shrugs, at a loss. \nSAITO But very definitely made of wool. Right now I'm lying on polyester. \nCobb glares at Nash, and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY \nTodashi watches the first of the countdowns hit ZERO- He looks up at Arthur, STIRRING, and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-DAY \nSaito turns from the carpet to look up at Cobb. \nSAITO Which means I'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment... (smiles) You've lived up to your reputation, Mr. Cobb... I'm still dreaming. \nCobb looks over to Arthur, but ARTHUR HAS VANISHED, and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY \nArthur's eyes flicker open, AWAKE. He RIPS at his tubes. \nTODASHI How'd it go? \nARTHUR Not good. \nArthur checks the remaining three countdowns, and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nSaito gets to his feet, looking admiringly at Cobb. \nSAITO A dream within a dream-I'm impressed. \nCobb lowers the gun. Defeated. Glances at his watch. The music REVERBERATES, the RIOTERS BANG ON THE DOOR, and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY \nArthur retracts the tubes into the case as he watches the next countdown hit ZERO, and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nAnother BANG on the door- Saito, confident now, approaches Cobb. Nash is behind Saito. \nSAITO But in my dream, we really ought to be playing by my rules... \nNASH Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito- \nSaito turns to Nash- \nCOBB We're not in your dream- \nSaito turns back to Cobb, BUT COBB HAS VANISHED- \nNASH We're in mine. \nSaito SPINS back to Nash- the DOOR SMASHES OFF ITS HINGES AS RIOTERS POUR INTO THE ROOM, SWARMING OVER NASH... BUT NASH IS GONE. The music DIES. Saito and the rioters stand there in the SILENCE, the light DWINDLING... and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY \nNash' eyes open, AWAKE. \nARTHUR (O.S.) Asshole! \nNash BLINKS. Arthur is in his face, furious. \nARTHUR How could you get the carpet wrong?! \nNASH It wasn't my fault! \nARTHUR You're the architect- \nNASH I didn't know he was going to rub his damn cheek on it! \nCobb pulls Arthur away from Nash. \nCOBB Lets go. \nARTHUR And you-what the hell was all that? \nINT. HELICOPTER ON PAD - CONTINUOUS \nNash, BEATEN BLOODY, sits on the far side, slumped against the wine. Beside him: SAITO. He nods politely at Cobb. \nSAITO He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life... \nSaito's BODYGUARD offers Cobb a GUN. \nSAITO So I offer you the satisfaction. \nCOBB That's not how I deal with things. \nSAITO Would you work with him again? \nCobb shakes his head. Saito's BODYGUARDS PULL Nash from the chopper. Saito motions Cobb and Arthur to sit. The chopper RISES. Cobb watches Nash DRAGGED across the pad. \nCOBB What will you do to him? \nSAITO Nothing. But I can't speak for your friends from Cobol Engineering. \nSaito looks out at the city slipping by. \nCOBB What do you want from us? \nSAITO Inception. \nArthur raises his eyebrows. Cobb is poker-faced. \nSAITO Is it possible? \nARTHUR Of course not. \nSAITO If you can steal an idea from someone's mind, why can't you plant one there instead? \nARTHUR Okay, here's planting an idea: I say to you, \"Don't think about elephants.\" (MORE) ARTHUR (CONT'D) (Saito nods) What are you thinking about? \nSAITO Elephants. \nARTHUR Right. But it's not your idea because you know I gave it to you. \nSAITO You could plant it subconsciously- \nARTHUR The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake. \nCOBB No, it isn't. \nSAITO Can you do it? \nCOBB I won't do it. \nSAITO In exchange, I'll give you the information you were paid to steal. \nCOBB Are you giving me a choice? Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol. \nSAITO Then you do have a choice. \nCOBB And I choose to leave. \nEXT. AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER \nThe helicopter sets down next to a PRIVATE JET. \nINT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS \nSaito indicates the plane. \nSAITO Tell the crew where you want to go, they'll file the plan en route. \nCobb and Arthur look at each other. Then move for the door. \nSAITO Mr. Cobb...? There is one other thing I could offer you. (Cobb stops) How would you like to go home? To America. To your children. \nCobb turns back to Saito. \nCOBB You can't fix that. Nobody could. \nSAITO Just like inception. \nCobb considers this. Arthur touches his arm. \nARTHUR Cobb, come on- \nCOBB How complex is the idea? \nSAITO Simple enough. \nCOBB No idea's simple when you have to plant it in someone else's mind. \nSAITO My main competitor is an old man in poor health. His son will soon inherit control of the corporation. I need him to decide to break up his father's empire. Against his own self-interest. \nARTHUR Cobb, we should walk away from this. \nCOBB If I were to do it. If I could do it... how do I know you can deliver? \nSAITO You don't. But I can. So do you want to take a leap of faith, or become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone? \nCobb looks at Saito. Barely nods. \nSAITO Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And choose your people more wisely. \nINT. PRIVATE JET - LATER \nCobb reclines his seat. Arthur picks at a salad, angry. \nARTHUR I know how much you want to go home- \nCOBB (sharp) No, you don't. \nARTHUR But this can't be done. \nCOBB It can. You just have to go deep enough. \nARTHUR You don't know that!- \nCOBB I've done it before. \nArthur is taken aback. Cobb turns to the window. \nARTHUR Did it work? \nMILES If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer to discuss with you. \nARIADNE A work placement? \nCOBB (smiles Not exactly. \nEXT. ROOFTOP, \u00c9COLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MOMENTS LATER \nAriadne leans against the parapet, overlooking Paris. She unwraps a sandwich, watching Cobb pull out a pad of GRAPH PAPER and a PEN. He offers them. She bites her sandwich. \nCOBB A test. \nARIADNE (mouth full) Aren't you going to tell me anything? \nCOBB Before I describe the job, I have to know you could do it. \nARIADNE Why? \nCOBB It's not, strictly speaking, legal. \nAriadne raises her eyebrows. \nCOBB You have two minutes to draw a maze that takes me one minute to solve. \nAriadne takes the pad and pen. Cobb looks at his watch. \nCOBB Go. \nShe starts DRAWING LINES on the grid, constructing a maze. \nCOBB Stop. \nAriadne hands the pad and pen to Cobb. He glances at the pad, then, looking her in the eye, TRACES the solution. She is taken aback. Cobb RIPS off the sheet, hands the pad back. \nCOBB Again. \nShe traces straight lines, CONCENTRATING... \nCOBB Stop. \nShe hands Cobb the pad, a touch pleased. Cobb solves the puzzle instantly, as before. Her smile falls. \nCOBB You'll have to- \nShe GRABS the pad, frustrated... but this time she FLIPS it over and starts drawing on the BLANK CARDBOARD of the back. Cobb watches, surprised. He smiles as he sees that she's drawing CIRCLES, creating a maze based on concentric rings. \nAriadne hands back the pad, defiant. Cobb takes the pen, starts the maze. This time he gets stuck. Nods. \nCOBB (working the maze) More like it. \nEXT. NARROW STREET, PARIS - DAY \nArthur stops at a warehouse door. Consults a piece of paper. \nINT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS \nA large, dusty warehouse. The SLIDING DOOR cracks open. Arthur enters. Looks around, approvingly. \nINT. SAME - LATER \nArthur DRAGS LAWN CHAIRS into the middle of the room. He erects a table. Lays out several SILVER CASES, unpacking them, laying out lines of tubing, MECHANISMS... \nEXT. PARISIAN CAFE - DAY \nCobb and Ariadne sit at an outdoor table. \nCOBB They say we only use a fraction of the true potential of our brains... but they're talking about when we're awake. While we dream, the mind performs wonders. \nARIADNE Such as? \nCOBB How do you imagine a building? You consciously create each aspect, puzzling over it in stages... But sometimes, when your imagination flies- \nARIADNE I'm discovering it. \nCOBB Exactly. Genuine inspiration. \nCobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cloth. \nCOBB In a dream your mind continuously does that... \nCobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows. \nCOBB It creates and perceives a world simultaneously. So well that you don't feel your brain doing the creating. That's why we can short- circuit the process... \nARIADNE How? \nCOBB By taking over the creating part. \nCobb draws a straight line between the two arrows. \nCOBB This is where you come in. You build the world of the dream. We take the subject into that dream, and let him \u00a3111 it with his subconscious \nARIADNE But are you trying to fool him that the dream is actually real life? \nCOBB (nods) While we're in there, We don't want him to realize he's dreaming. \nARIADNE How could I ever get enough detail to Convince him that it's real? \nCOBB Our dreams reel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up we realize things were strange, \nAriadne gestures around them- \nARIADNE But all the textures of real life- the stone, the fabric. cars... people... your mind can't create all this. \nCOBB It does. Every time you dream. Let me ask you a question: You never remember the beginning of your dreams, do you? You just turn up in the middle of what's going on. \nARIADNE I guess. \nCOBB So... how did we end up at this restaurant? \nARIADNE We came here from... \nAriadne trails off, confused. \nCOBB How did we get here? Where are we? \nAriadne THINKS, unable to remember. A FAINT RUMBLE begins. \nARIADNE Oh my God. We're dreaming. \nCOBB Because building dreams out of your own memories is the surest way to lose your grip on what's real and what's a dream. \nARIADNE Did that happen to you? \nCobb says nothing. He stands there, starinq at Ariadne. PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile. \nCOBB Look, this isn't about me- \nCobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him- \nARIADNE Is that why you need me to build your dreams? \nA passerby GRABS Ariadne's shoulder- \nCOBB Leave her alone- \nMore of the crowd join in, PULLING at Ariadne, holding her arms open- Cobb PULLS people off- the crowd PUSHES him away- Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd towards the helpless, Ariadne- it is Mal. She approaches with even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy. \nARIADNE Wake me up, Cobb. \nAs Mal walks, she pulls out a LARGE KNIFE- \nCOBB Mal, no! \nARIADNE Wake me up! \nAriadne SCREAMS as Mal LUNGES at her with the knife and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. WORKSHOP-DAY \nAriadne WAKES, BREATHING HARD. Arthur moves to her- \nARTHUR It's okay. \nARIADNE Why couldn't I wake? \nARTHUR The only way to wake from inside the dream is to die. \nCobb, in the lawn chair opposite, PULLS his tubes out. \nCOBB She'll need a totem. \nARIADNE What? \nARTHUR Some kind of personal icon. A small object that you can always have with you, and that no one else knows, \nCobb gets to his feet, Ariadne stares at him, furious. He heads to the bathroom. \nARIADNE That's some subconscious you've got, Cobb. (calls after him) She's a real charmer! \nARTHUR Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb. \nARIADNE (surprised) She's his wife? \nArthur nods, pulling off Ariadne's tubes. \nARTHUR So. A totem. You need something small, potentially heavy... \nINT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS \nCobb takes out his PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the marble counter... \nINT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS \nAriadne looks at Arthur, puzzled. \nARIADNE Like a coin? \nARTHUR Too common. You need something that has a weight or movement that only you know. \nINT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS \nCobb STUDIES the spin of the top as it decays, becoming more and more ECCENTRIC... \nINT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS \nARIADNE What's yours? \nArthur holds out a DIE. \nARTHUR A loaded die. \nAriadne reaches for it- Arthur snatches sit away- \nARTHUR I can't let you handle it. That's the point. No one else can know the weight or balance of it. \nARIADNE Why? \nARTHUR So when you examine your totem... \nINT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS \nCobb's spinning top WOBBLES OVER. \nARTHUR (O.S.) You know, beyond a doubt, that you're not in someone else's dream. \nCobb GRABS it like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline. \nINT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS \nAriadne thinks this over. \nARIADNE That's not an issue for me. \nARTHUR Why not? \nARIADNE Arthur, maybe you can't see what's going on, maybe you don't want to. But Cobb's got problems he's tried to bury down there. I'm not going to open my mind to someone like that. \nAriadne gets to her feet. Walks away. \nCOBB (O.S.) She'll be back. \nArthur turns. Cobb is standing in the bathroom doorway. \nCOBB I've never seen anyone pick it up so fast. And one reality won't be enough for her now. When she comes back, get her building mazes. \nARTHUR Where will you be? \nSAITO This time, it would seem there is. \nCobb looks at him, uneasy. Yusuf pulls out another bottle. \nYUSUF Of course. I use it every day. \nYusuf hands it to Cobb, who considers the white liquid inside. \nCOBB For what? \nYusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy, to a METAL DOOR. He STOPS- second thoughts. \nYUSUF Perhaps... you will not want to see. \nCobb motions to continue. Yusuf pulls out a large key. \nINT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS \nA dark room with ROWS of low COTS. Each with a sleeping occupant. Tubes connect their wrists. An ELDERLY BALD MAN watches over them. \nEAMES (counting) Eighteen, twenty-all connected, bloody hell. \nYUSUF They come every day. To share the dream. \nYusuf nods at the Elderly Bald Man, who moves to the nearest bed. Reaches out to the OCCUPANT. Gives his face a FIRM SLAP. The sleeper does not even stir. \nYUSUF See? Very stable. \nCOBB How long do they dream? \nYUSUF Three, four hours. Every day. \nCOBB How long in dream time? \nYUSUF With this compound... about forty hours. Each and every day. \nSaito surveys the room, appalled. \nSAITO Why do they do it? \nYUSUF Tell him, Mr. Cobb. \nCOBB After a while... (looks at Saito) It becomes the only way you can dream. \nYUSUF Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb? \nCobb STARES at the sleepers. Uneasy. \nEAMES They come here every day to sleep? \nELDERLY BALD MAN (O.S.) No. \nCobb turns to the Elderly Bald Man, who looks fondly at his dreamers. \nELDERLY BALD MAN They come to be woken up... the dream has become their reality... \nThe Elderly Bald Man pokes a crooked finger at Cobb's chest. \nELDERLY BALD MAN And who are you to say otherwise? \nCobb STARES at the Elderly Bald Man. DISTURBED. Cobb turns to Yusuf. TOSSES him the bottle. \nCOBB Let's see what you can do. \nINT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER \nCobb is lying on an empty cot, asleep. Yusuf stands over him. As we move in on Cobb's SLEEPING FACE we hear the sound of a FREIGHT TRAIN, BUILDING, and we- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WASTELAND - DAY \nCLOSE ON Cobb's face as he lies, EYES CLOSED, cheek pressed to a METAL RAIL- THE SOUND OF THE TRAIN IS DEAFENING- Cobb is BREATHING, BREATHING, BREATHING, and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - DAY \nCobb's eyes open. Yusuf is watching him. \nYUSUF Sharp, no? \nCobb nods. Gets to his feet, looking around- \nINT. BATHROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS \nCobb SPLASHES water on his face, breathing hard- INSERT CUT: A CURTAIN BILLOWS. MAL TURNS TO US, HAIR BLOWING, SMILING. Cobb fumbles in his pockets, pulls out his spinning top. He tries to set it spinning on the back edge of the sink, but it FALLS to the floor and rolls towards the door- Saito is there. WATCHING Cobb. He looks down at the spinning top. \nSAITO Everything alright, Mr. Cobb? \nCobb dries his face with a paper towel. Picks up his top. \nCOBB Everything's fine. \nINT. BACK ROOM, WORKSHOP - NIGHT \nClose on a small BRASS CHESS PIECE. Ariadne tips it over. Frowning, she picks up a micro drill, peels back the felt on the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its base. Tests the TIPPING POINT again. A NOISE makes her look up. \nINT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS \nAriadne comes into the main space. Someone is there, unpacking one of the MECHANISMS. Cobb. \nARIADNE You're back. \nCobb looks up with a start. Caught out. \nARIADNE Are you going under on your own? \nCOBB I just-I need to test some things. I didn't realize anyone was here. \nARIADNE Just working on my totem. \nAriadne holds up the chess piece. Cobb reaches for it. \nCOBB Let me see- \nAriadne SNAPS it out of his reach. Smiles. Cobb nods. \nCOBB You're learning. \nTwo AFRICAN PEDESTRIANS wander into view. \nARTHUR Are those yours? \nEames shakes his head. Cobb turns to Yusuf. \nARTHUR Yusuf? \nYUSUF Yup. Sorry. \nCOBB Suppress them. We don't bring our own projections into the dream-we let Fischer's subconscious supply the people. \nEAMES Saito, when do I get to see Browning? \nSAITO You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday. We've arranged for you to spend several days... \nINT. ANTEROOM, MAURICE FISCHER'S OFFICE - DAY \nEames sits in the crowded room. Boxes and files are piled high. Browning stands by a pair of double doors. \nSAITO (V.O.) ...as part of a consulting litigation team working for Browning. \nBROWNING I'm not smelling settlement here-we take them down. \nLAWYER Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of avoiding litigation- \nBrowning turns to the lawyer. Calm, but POWERFUL. \nBROWNING Shall we relay your concerns directly to Maurice? \nBrowning opens the doors to Maurice Fischer's inner office. Eames leans in to watch as Browning beckons the Lawyer into- \nINT. MAURICE FISCHER'S INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nThe office is a MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL ROOM: a BED where the desk should be. Browning addresses a figure at the window. ROBERT FISCHER, 30'S, abstracted. \nBROWNING How is he? \nFischer turns to Browning. Motions silence, as he glances at his FATHER in the bed. Wheezing gently. \nBROWNING I don't want to bother him unnecessarily but I know he- \nFATHER Robert! I've told you to keep out the damn!- \nMAURICE LASHES OUT, KNOCKING things from his bedside table. A NURSE calms Maurice as Fischer crouches to retrieve a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH. He looks at the photo through the broken glass- a YOUNG BOY holds a PINWHEEL CLEARLY MADE BY A CHILD (each of the points is numbered in pen), his FATHER blows on it. \nBROWNING Must be a cherished memory of his- \nFISCHER I put it by his bed. He hasn't even noticed. \nBROWNING Robert, we have to talk about a power of attorney. I know this is hard for you, but it's important that we start to think about the future- \nFISCHER Not now, Uncle Peter. \nBrowning looks at Fischer, considering. Biding his time. \nEAMES (V.O.) The vultures are circling. The sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the stronger Peter Browning becomes... \nEames WATCHES Browning, STUDYING his every move . \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nEames gestures at a mirror, as if offering to shake hands... \nEAMES (V.O.) I've had time to learn Browning's physical presence and mannerisms... In the mirror: BROWNING GESTURES BACK. \nINT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS \nEAMES Now, in the dream, I can impersonate Browning and suggest the concepts to Fischer's conscious mind... (draws a diagram) Then we take Fischer down another level and his own subconscious feeds it right back to him. \nARTHUR (impressed) So he gives himself the idea. \nEAMES Precisely. That's the only way to make it stick. It has to seem self-generated. \nARTHUR Eames, I'm impressed. \nEAMES Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DESERTED HOTEL LOBBY - DAY \nThe team sit on the steps of the large marble lobby, debating. Ariadne is showing Arthur the lobby. \nEAMES He's not scheduled for surgery, no dental, nothing. \nCOBB I thought he had some knee thing? \nEAMES Nothing they'd put him under for. Besides, we need a good ten hours. \nSAITO Sydney to Los Angeles. \nThey turn to Saito. \nSAITO Twelve hours and forty-five minutes-one of the longest flights in the world. He makes it every two weeks... \nEXT. AIRFIELD - DAY \nFischer steps out of a black town car and walks across the tarmac towards a GULF STREAM JET, accompanied by two aides. \nCOBB (V.O.) Surely he flies private? \nSAITO (V.O.) Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane. \nFischer is met at the steps by a DISTRAUGHT FLIGHT OFFICER. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY \nCobb chews this over. Arthur comes over. \nARTHUR It'd have to be a 747. \nCOBB Why? \nARTHUR On a 747 the pilots are up above, first class is in the nose so nobody walks through the cabin. We'd have to buyout the whole cabin, and the first class flight attendant- \nSAITO We bought the airline. \nEveryone turns to Saito. \nAriadne looks into the room to see Cobb and Mal talking, arguing. A private moment. Mal brushes at Cobb's hair, trying to convince him. We hear snatches of conversation- \nMAL You remember when you asked me to marry you? \nCOBB Of course... \nMAL You said you had a dream... \nCOBB That we'd grow old together. \nMAL And we can. You know how to find me... you know what you have to do. \nCobb is shaking his head, gently. Mal looks into Cobb's eyes- gentle, loving... Mal SPOTS Ariadne spying on them. \nFREEZES, staring, hostile. Cobb turns, sees Ariadne, moves towards her, leaving Mal. \nCOBB You shouldn't be in here. \nCobb guides her back into the elevator. \nARIADNE I wanted to know what \"tests\" you need to do on your own every night. \nINT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - DAY \nCobb shuts the CAGE DOOR. Ariadne hits a button. The elevator RISES. Through the GRILL Ariadne can see a BEACH stretching off into the distance. The elevator stops. Mal sits on the sand. Beside her, the two children are crouched, away from us, building a SANDCASTLE. \nARIADNE Why do you do this to yourself? \nCOBB This is the only way I can still dream. \nARIADNE Is it so important to dream? \nCobb stares at his family. \nCOBB In my dreams... we're still together. \nThe kids, WITHOUT TURNING AROUND, jump up and RUN AWAY. \nINT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS \nThe elevator descends. \nARIADNE But these aren't just dreams, are they? They're memories. You said never to use memories. \nCOBB And I shouldn't. \nARIADNE You're keeping her alive. \nCOBB No. \nARIADNE You can't let her go. \nCOBB No. These are moments I regret. Moments I turned into dreams so I could change them. \nAriadne's fingers move across the buttons- stop at the \"B.\" \nARIADNE What've you got buried down there that you regret? \nCobb pushes her hand away. Hits the third floor button. \nCOBB There's only one thing I need you to understand about me... \nINT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nAriadne follows Cobb into the kitchen. A THIN MAN is there, standing by the table. He holds a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER. \nARIADNE This is your house? \nCOBB Mine and Mal's. \nARIADNE Where is she? \nCOBB She'd already died. \nThe Thin Man offers Cobb the piece of paper. A CHILD'S SHOUT- Cobb TURNS. Ariadne follows his gaze to the garden. A small blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his haunches to look at something on the ground. \nCOBB It's James. My boy. He's found something. Maybe a worm. \nA slightly older girl RUNS into view. \nCOBB And there's Philippa. \nShe crouches beside the boy. Their FACES ARE AWAY FROM US. They point and discuss whatever is on the ground. \nCOBB I thought about calling out, so they'd turn and smile those incredible smiles... but I'm out of time- \nThe Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand. \nTHIN MAN Right now. Or never, Cobb. \nCobb nods, turns from the window- \nCOBB Then I panic that I'll always wish I'd seen them turn, that I can't waste this chance... \nCobb TURNS BACK to call out- but the children RACE OFF... \nCOBB But the moment's passed. And whatever I do, the dream's always the same... When I'm about to call... they run. \nCobb watches them run off, calling for grandma, FACES UNSEEN. \nCOBB If I'm going to see their faces again-I've got to get back here in the real world... \nBehind him, Ariadne SLAMS the grill shut. Cobb TURNS. \nINT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS \nAriadne hits the BASEMENT button. The elevator starts to DESCEND. ariadne STARES, fascinated as glimpses of floors slip past: Mal's childhood bedroom, a thundering wall of freight train... The elevator STOPS. Through the grill Ariadne sees a HOTEL SUITE. She pulls open the grill, steps cautiously out into- \nINT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (NOW NIGHT) \nDISHEVELED bedclothes, UPENDED room service table, STRAWBERRIES across the floor. A STRUGGLE. Ariadne steps forwards- SMASH- she looks down to see that she has kicked over a CHAMPAGNE FLUTE. Ariadne feels a draught. The CURTAIN BILLOWS. \nMAL (O.S.) What are you doing here? \nAriadne TURNS. Mal is there. \nARIADNE My name is- \nMAL I know who you are. What are you doing here? \nFischer takes a beat. But Cobb seems harmless. \nFISCHER Actually, he was my father. \nCOBB I'm very sorry for your loss. He was an inspiring figure. \nThe Flight Attendant brings their drinks- Cobb takes them. \nCOBB Thanks. \nAs he turns to Fischer he LOWERS his right hand ... a CLEAR LIQUID DROPS into Fischer's water as Cobb hands it to him. \nCOBB To Maurice Fischer. (they drink) I'll leave you in peace. \nFischer grants him a smile. \nEXT. 747 - LATER \nThe great plane SOARS through a burning cloudscape. \nINT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER \nCobb reaches into the overhead for a blanket- lets it fall onto Fischer's head- Fischer doesn't flinch. ASLEEP. Cobb SIGNALS the others. The First Flight Attendant unlocks a CUPBOARD in the galley, then leaves, closing the curtain. Arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a MECHANISM CASE. \nCobb and Arthur open the mechanism- uncoil the tubes- feed them around the window side of each of the seats. Arthur rolls up Fischer's cuff- PUSHES the needle cap into Fischer's wrist. Arthur pulls Fischer's cuff down and hides the tubes behind the armrest of Fischer's seat. \nArthur runs the next tube to Ariadne. Cobb puts the case on Yusuf's lap. Yusuf checks the TIMERS, tapping the syringes. The others recline their seats. Yusuf HITS A BUTTON- closes the case- places it at his feet. He settles back, and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. SEDAN - DAY \nCobb DRIVES. Saito and Arthur are in the back. Rain BEATS down. Cobb pulls over- \nEXT. NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nYusuf stands on the corner, silver briefcase in hand, collar turned up against the rain. He reaches for the door. \nINT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS \nYusuf clambers into the back, brushing rain from his face. \nARTHUR (indicates rain) Couldn't you have peed before you went under? \nYUSUF Sorry. \nThe front door OPENS and Eames climbs in, soaked. \nEAMES Bit too much free champagne before takeoff, Yusuf? \nYUSUF Ha bloody ha. \nCOBB At least we know he'll be looking for a cab in this. \nINT./EXT. SEDAN ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nCobb pulls out into the heavy traffic. He weaves around several cars before lining up behind a YELLOW CAB. \nCOBB Brace yourselves. \nCobb hits the gas- REAR ENDS the cab with a CRUNCH. The CABDRIVER gets out, fuming. Heads to Cobb's window- \nCABDRIVER Hey, asshole! Why don't you try driving without your thumb up- \nHe sees the SILENCED PISTOL Cobb is holding at his belly. \nCOBB Walk away. \nThe Cabdriver backs off. Arthur climbs into the cab. Both cars pull away. \nINT./EXT. CAB ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS \nArthur SLOWS in front of the TRAIN STATION, peering at the pedes pedestrians. He SPOTS Fischer, lights the cab's sign. Fischer FLAGS him down. Fischer JUMPS into the back, brushing rain from his shoulders. \nFISCHER Third and Market. Snappy. \nEames JUMPS in from the other side. \nFISCHER What're you doing? \nEAMES Sorry, I thought it was free. Maybe we could share. \nFISCHER Maybe not. \nSaito gets into the front passenger seat. Pointing a gun. \nFISCHER Great. \nArthur pulls away. Fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses it at Eames. \nFISCHER (contemptuous) There's 500 dollars in there. And the wallet's worth more than that. For that you ought to at least drop me at my stop. \nEames smiles at this. \nEAMES I'm afraid- \nA SHOT SHATTERS the window by Eames's head- another SHOT IMPACTS by Saito- \nEAMES Get us out of here! \nArthur hits the gas, but a BLACK S.U.V. SKIDS sideways in front, BLOCKING the path- \nA BLOCK BEHIND- Cobb is at a light. ARIADNE is getting in the front. Cobb has HEARD the GUNFIRE- \nCOBB Come on!- \nCobb looks ahead to the AMBUSH, hits the gas- the sedan ROCKETS forwards... but BAM- A FREIGHT TRAIN CLIPS THE FRONT OF THE SEDAN, SHOVING IT SIDEWAYS AS AN ENDLESS TRAIN BARRELS PAST, A WALL BETWEEN COBB AND THE AMBUSH- \nA SECOND S.U.V. is behind the cab- PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY MEN advance through the traffic, weapons trained on the cab. Bullets RIP into the cab as Eames throws himself on top of Fischer, PULLING a SACK over his head- \nInside the sedan, Ariadne watches the train passing- \nARIADNE This wasn't in the design- \nCobb BACKS UP, SPINS around, heading for the tail of the train- \nA Security Man emerges from the front S.U.V. carrying an AUTOMATIC RIFLE- he steps towards the cab through the rain, raises his weapon and BLASTS THE CAB'S WINDSCREEN- \nCobb clears the end of the train, and SKIDS across the tracks- \nARTHUR Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out great, didn't it, Cobb? \nCobb grabs Arthur. \nCOBB You don't know anything about that. This was the only way to do this job, Arthur. I did what I had to do to get back to my children. \nEAMES So you led us into a war zone with no way out. \nCOBB We have a way out. The kick. We just have to push on, do the job as fast as possible and get out using the kick. \nEAMES Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes. I'm sitting it out on this level. \nCOBB You'll never make it, Eames. Fischer's security is surrounding this place as we speak. The ten hours of the flight is a week at this level-you'll never make it without getting killed. Downwards is the only way forwards. We have to carry on. \nSaito groans. Cobb looks at him- \nCOBB And we have to do it fast. \nEames and Arthur weigh this. \nCOBB Eames, go get ready. Arthur, let's get in there and soften him up. \nINT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - LATER \nCobb and Arthur, wearing BALACLAVAS, PULL the sack from Fischer's head. He is chained to the radiator. \nFISCHER I'm insured against kidnapping up to ten million-this'll be simple- \nCOBB No, it won't. \nFischer looks at Cobb, unnerved. \nARTHUR In. your lather's office, below the bookshelves, is his personal safe. We need the combination. \nFISCHER I never noticed a safe- \nCOBB Doesn't mean you don't know the combination. \nFISCHER Well, I don't. \nARTHUR We have it on good authority that you do. \nFISCHER Whose? \nINT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nYusuf looks through Fischer's wallet. Eames is opening a HINGED, THREE-WING MIRROR. \nYUSUF Five hundred dollars, this cost? \nEAMES What's inside? \nYUSUF Cash, cards, ID... and this- \nYusuf holds up a SNAPSHOT: the photo from Maurice Fischer's office- YOUNG ROBERT holds his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his FATHER blows on it. Eames takes it from Yusuf. STUDIES it. Cobb enters. Eames hands him the snapshot. \nEAMES Useful? \nCobb studies the snapshot. Eames examines himself in the hinged mirror from multiple angles: ONE BY ONE the myriad Eames reflections BECOME BROWNINGS. Cobb pockets the photo. \nCOBB You're on. You've got an hour. \nEAMES An hour? I was supposed to have all night to crack him. \nCOBB And Saito was supposed to keep his guts on the inside. You've got an hour-get something we can use. \nEames turns from the mirror AS BROWNING. He glances at his watch, then SCREAMS, as if begging for mercy- \nINT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nBrowning's CRY reverberates- Fischer looks up, concerned- \nFISCHER What's that? \nARTHUR Good authority. \nAnother cry rings out. Fischer recognizes the voice. \nFISCHER Uncle Peter?! Make them stop- \nARTHUR The combination. \nFISCHER I don't know it! \nARTHUR Why would Browning tell us you did? \nFISCHER Let me talk to him-I'll find out. \nINT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nCobb pushes Browning (Eames), bloody and bruised, into the room and forces him down next to Fischer. Cobb handcuffs Browning's wrist to a metal bracket on the side of the sink. \nCOBB You've got an hour. Get talking. \nCobb leaves. \nBROWNING (EAMES) They've had me for two days. They've got someone with access to your father's office and they're trying to open his safe-they thought I'd know the combination, but I don't- \nFISCHER Neither do I, Uncle Peter. \nBROWNING (confused) Maurice told me that after he passed only you would be able to open it. \nFISCHER He never gave me the combination. \nBrowning thinks for a minute. Realizes something. \nBROWNING He did, he just didn't tell you that it was a combination. \nFISCHER What, then? \nBROWNING Something only you would know. Some meaningful combination of numbers from your experiences with Maurice- \nFISCHER We didn't have a lot of meaningful experiences together. \nBROWNING Perhaps after your mother died... \nFISCHER After my mother died, I went to him in my grief. (MORE) FISCHER (CONT'D) You know what he told me? \"There's really nothing to be said, Robert.\" \nBROWNING He always had a hard time with emotional- \nCOBB She... she believed they weren't real. That our real children were waiting. Somewhere above... \nINT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nMal shakes her head at Cobb as he USHERS the children out of the room, FACES UNSEEN- \nCOBB Calm down, Mal- \nMAL They're projections, Dom. Your dreams. I'm their mother-don't you think I can tell the difference? \nCobb closes the door- turns to her, eyes full of bitter tears. \nCOBB If it's my dream then why can't I control it? Why can't I stop this? \nMAL (it's obvious) You don't know you're dreaming. \nCOBB You keep telling me I am- \nMAL And you don't believe me! \nCOBB (V.O.) She was certain. But she loved me too much to go without me. So she made a plan... \nINT. ELEGANT HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nCobb walks along, checking door numbers against a key. \nCOBB (V.O.) For our anniversary... \nINT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK) \nCobb enters the lavish suite. He notices the DISHEVELED BEDCLOTHES. \nHe steps forwards- SMASH- he has tipped over a champagne glass with his foot... dinner for two is SPREAD ACROSS THE FLOOR. He looks at the DEBRIS, confused... next to the broken glass is a SPINNING TOP. He picks it up, studying it, thinking. He feels a draught, looks to the window. The CURTAIN BILLOWS. \nEXT. EXTERIOR ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK) \nCobb looks out the window: Mal sits on the ledge of the opposite window. HAIR BLOWING. Feet dangling over the dizzyingly high atrium. She smiles. \nMAL Join me. \nCOBB Mal, come back inside. \nMAL No. I'm going to jump. And you're coming with me. \nCOBB No, I'm not. This is real-if you jump, you're not going to wake up, you're going to die. Let's go back inside and talk about this, please. \nMAL We've talked enough. \nShe KICKS off a shoe and watches it DROP. \nMAL Come out onto the ledge or I'll jump right now. \nShe means it. Cobb swings his legs out, sitting on the ledge opposite is wife. He looks down at the drop. \nMAL I'm asking you to take a leap of faith. \nCOBB I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave our children. \nMAL If I go without you, they'll take them away, anyway. \nCOBB What do you mean? \nMAL I filed a letter with our attorney. Explaining how I'm fearful for my safety, how you've threatened to kill me... \nCobb looks back at the wrecked hotel suite, PANICKING... \nMAL (CONT'D) I love you, Dom. I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them. We're going home to our real children. \nCOBB Out children are here, Mal. \nMal CLOSES HER EYES. Cobb looks for some way to reach her... \nMAL You're waiting for a train... \nCOBB NO! MAL, NO, I CAN'T! \nMAL A train that will take you far away... \nCOBB DON'T DO THIS! \nMAL You know where you hope this train will take you, you can't know for sure... \nCOBB DON'T! \nMAL But it doesn't matter... \nCOBB NO! \nMAL Because you'll be together... \nMal SLIPS FORWARD INTO SPACE. Cobb SCREAMS after her. Then tries to bury his face in the wall... \nINT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY \nCobb stares as he remembers. \nCOBB He letter to the authorities refuted all the claims about her sanity that she knew I'd make... \nINT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nCobb stands with the Thin Man, who has a piece of paper. \nCOBB (V.O.) She'd had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists. \nCobb hears a SHOUT- turns to the garden. James CROUCHES, Philippa joins him, examining the ground, FACES UNSEEN... \nCOBB (V.O.) (CONT'D) It was impossible for me to explain the nature of her madness... \nThe Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand. \nTHIN MAN Right now. Or never, Cobb. \nCobb turns back to the window- about to call out- James and Philippa RUN OFF. Cobb turns from the window. Looks at the paper in his hand. It is an AIRPLANE TICKET. \nCOBB (V.O.) So I ran. And I've been running ever since, trying to buy my way back to my family... \nINT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY \nCobb looks across at Ariadne. \nEAMES We need the imagery, the words... \nARIADNE So you destroy his one positive relationship? \nCOBB No. We repair his relationship with his father and expose his godfather's true nature. \nEAMES Hell, we should be charging Fischer as much as Saito. \nARTHUR What about his security? It's going to get worse as we go deeper. \nCOBB We bring in Mr. Charles. \nARTHUR No. \nEAMES Who's Mr. Charles? \nARTHUR A bad idea. \nCOBB Arthur, the second we approach Fischer in that hotel, they're gonna mow us down-we run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job. \nEAMES So you've done it before? \nARTHUR Sure. But it didn't work. The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces. \nEames takes this in. \nEAMES You learned a lot, though. Right? \nCOBB (to Eames) I'll need a decoy. \nEAMES No problem. How about a pretty young lady I've used before? \nCOBB Fine- \nCobb looks back: a second S.U.V. pulls out, tailing them. \nCOBB (CONT'D) (to Yusuf) I know you've got to stay ahead of them, but drive with kid gloves, okay? The world down there is going to be very unstable- \nARTHUR And don't make the jump too soon- that kick is our only way back, we have to be ready to catch it- \nYUSUF I'll use the music to let you know when it's coming, but the rest is up to you. \nArthur puts the mechanism onto the front seat. \nYUSUF (CONT'D) Everyone ready? \nNods all round. \nYUSUF (CONT'D) Sweet dreams- \nYusuf hits a button and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET \nFischer nurses a drink. Staring at the ice cracking. \nBLONDE (O.S.) Am I boring you? \nFischer looks up. A beautiful BLONDE is next to him. \nBLONDE (CONT'D) I was telling you my story. I guess it wasn't to your liking. \nFISCHER I have a lot on my mind. \nFischer looks around the bar. There are several STERN-LOOKING CHARACTERS paying him too much attention. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nArthur and Ariadne sit at a table across the lobby. They spot Cobb moving across the lobby towards Fischer. \nARTHUR And there goes Mr. Charles. \nARIADNE Who or what, exactly, is Mr. Charles? \nARTHUR It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS \nCobb approaches the bar, watched closely by Fischer's Sub- security. \nCOBB Mr. Fishcer! Good to see you again. Rod Green, Marketing. (to Blonde) And you must be... \nBLONDE Leaving. \nShe presses against Fischer as she slides off her stool and deposits a cocktail napkin in front of him. \nBLONDE (CONT'D) In case you get bored. \nCobb watches her walk away. The Sub-security FOLLOWS her. \nCOBB I think you just got blown off... unless her phone number really does have only six digits. \nFischer glances at the napkin: \"528-491.\" \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nArthur watches the Sub-security follow the Blonde. \nARIADNE And why don't you approve? \nARTHUR Because it involves telling the mark that he's dreaming. Which involves attracting a lot of attention to us. \nARIADNE Didn't Cobb say never to do that? \nARTHUR You must've noticed by now how much time Cobb spends doing things he says never to do. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS \nCobb turns to Fischer. \nCOBB Strange way to make friends. (off look) Lifting your wallet, I mean. \nFischer pats his pocket. Empty. He looks to the lobby where he sees the Sub-security trailing the Blonde. \nFISCHER Goddamn it. The wallet alone's worth- \nCOBB Five hundred bucks. I know. Don't worry, my guys are on it. \nCOBB Let's find out what. \nCobb nods at Arthur, who starts unpacking the mechanism. Browning watches. Silent. \nCOBB Let's do to him what he was going to do to you. \nCobb rolls up his sleeve. Nods at Fischer to do the same. \nCOBB We'll penetrate his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know. \nFischer looks Cobb in the eye. Decides- rolls up his sleeve, offering his bare arm. The team run tubes to each other- Arthur injects Fischer, whose head slumps. \nARTHUR He's out. \nARIADNE Wait, Cobb-I'm lost. Whose subconscious are we going into? \nCOBB Fischer's. I told him it was Browning's so he'd come with us as part of our team. \nARTHUR (impressed) He's going to help us break into his own subconscious. \nCOBB That's the idea. He'll think that his security is Browning's and fight them to learn the truth about his father. \nArthur hits buttons on the mechanism. The team goes out one by one. Cobb is last. \nCOBB Fischer's subconscious is going to run you down hard. \nARTHUR I'll lead them on a merry chase. \nCOBB Be back in time for the kick. \nARTHUR I'm on it. \nCobb is no longer listening- he stares at the net curtains, BILLOWING like those in Mal's suite- a GLIMPSE of someone (Mal?) As the screen goes WHITE, and we are- \nEXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY \nCLOSE ON Cobb's face, staring. Fixed. \nARIADNE (O.S.) Cobb? Cobb? \nAriadne is beside him. They stand on a cliff, dressed in white snowsuits, carrying white-painted weapons like WWII commandos. Cobb checks his SNIPER RIFLE, examines their objective: a massive FORTIFIED MEDICAL FACILITY a mile below. \nARIADNE What's down there? \nCOBB Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn. \nARIADNE I meant what's down there for you? \nCobb turns to her. Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive, SKIING down from the hill above. Cobb pulls Eames out of Fischer's earshot. \nCOBB You're the dreamer. I need you to draw the security away from the complex. \nEAMES Then who guides Fischer in? You? \nCOBB If I know the route... we could be compromised. \nEames looks as Cobb, uneasy. Ariadne comes over. \nARIADNE I designed the place. \nCOBB No. You're with me. \nSAITO (O.S.) I could do it. \nThey turn to Saito. Saito shrugs at Eames. Eames smiles. \nCOBB Eames, brief Saito on the route into the complex. What we're looking for is going to be in the most heavily fortified section. That north tower. \nCobb moves to Fischer. Saito COUGHS. SPITS. Eames sees BLOOD on the snow. Looks at Saito. \nCOBB Mr. Fischer, you're going in with Mr. Saito. \nFISCHER You're not coming in? \nCOBB You have to do this on your own. You have to get in there, break into your godfather's mind and find out the truth about your father. \nCobb taps Fischer's radio mike. \nCOBB Keep this live at all times. I'll be listening in, covering you. (holds up the sniper rifle) The windows on the upper floors are big enough that I can cover you from that south tower. \nCobb slips into his skis, shoulders his rifle. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT \nArthur checks the mechanism. He hears LOW BOOMS like thunder. He checks his watch- THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS FORWARDS. With a last look at the sleepers, he heads out into the corridor... \nINT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY \nA GUNSHOT slams into the van as Yusuf DRIVES- he glances back to see a MOTORCYCLE pulling up behind him, the REAR PASSENGER FIRING A SHOTGUN- the bike pulls alongside Yusuf's window as the passenger RELOADS- Yusuf YANKS the wheel TOWARDS the bike, bringing the shotgun barrel into the cab so he can GRAB it, spin the wheel back- PULLING the passenger from the back of the bike... Yusuf turns a corner, heading into a disused MARKET- \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nArthur walks towards the elevator. It OPENS- a SECURITY MAN emerges, heading right for him. Arthur takes a TURN, speeding up. The BOOMS are louder, and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY \nThe bike crosses behind the van, catching up again as the driver pulls a handgun and starts BLASTING. Up ahead, an S.U.V. sits in a side road, lining up to head off the van- the SECURITY MAN driving the S.U.V. guns it, as the bike creeps up on the other side of the van- Yusuf HITS THE BRAKES, forcing the bike out into the path of the S.U.V., tossing the rider like a rag doll- \nHeading out of the market, the van races onto a FREEWAY ON RAMP, approaching the BRIDGE. An S.U.V. SMASHES into the van's side, FORCING it up against a CRASH BARRIER... the van starts to SLOWLY TILT OVER THE BARRIER as the S.U.V. PUSHES- \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nAs Arthur hurries down the corridor, the corridor starts to TILT, and Arthur is forced to run UP ONTO THE WALL- he rounds a corner- STRAIGHT INTO another Security Man- Arthur HEAD BUTTS him and they STRUGGLE- as they struggle, the corridor SPINS around, THROWING THEM UP ONTO THE WALLS, THE CEILING- as wall becomes floor they DROP through a door into- \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe fight continues all over the spinning room- and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY OFF RAMP NEAR BRIDGE - DAY \nSLEEPING ARTHUR BOUNCES around as the van TILTS, SCRAPING along the barrier- the van CLEARS THE END OF THE BARRIER AND ROLLS DOWN THE EMBANKMENT, and we- \nCOBB What did he add? \nAriadne looks at Cobb. \nARIADNE I shouldn't tell you. If Mal- \nCOBB There's no time-what did he add? \nARIADNE Utility closets, trap doors... \nCOBB What about service features? Did he add any large pipes or- \nARIADNE Ducts. He added an air duct system- it doesn't follow the maze. They can use it to go straight from the outer walls to the upper tower. \nCOBB Explain it to them. \nARIADNE (into radio) Saito? \nEXT. CLIFF FACE BEHIND COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS \nSaito is using a hammer to tap in a belay. \nSAITO Go ahead. \nAnd we- \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RAISED BRIDGE - DAY \nYusuf looks at the Security Man in the S.U.V., gives him the finger and hits the GAS- RACING BACKWARDS at the barrier... and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nArthur RUNS UP the stairs, gun in hand- rounds a corner and- IMPOSSIBLY- arrives behind the Security Man, who looks at him, CONFUSED, then looks down to realize he is now at the edge of a dangerous drop- Arthur shrugs. \nARTHUR Paradox. \nArthur PUSHES him over the edge- he falls- Arthur races up to the fourth floor- throws open the door- and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RAISED BRIDGE - DAY \nIn SLOW MOTION- the van SMASHES THROUGH THE CONCRETE BARRIER- and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nArthur is SPRINTING down the corridor when a TREMENDOUS CRASH sends him FLYING into the air- and we- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY \nA MASSIVE RUMBLE prompts Cobb to look across the valley- \nEXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS \nEames shoots out of the trees, then FALLS to the snow as he sees a great CRACKING up ahead- the SLOPE IS FALLING AWAY IN AN AVALANCHE- \nEXT. CLIFF FACE BEHIND COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS \nSaito hears the RUMBLE above them. He looks down, Fischer is below, near the bottom of the sheer face- \nSAITO Look out! \nSaito CUTS the rope- they FALL- HIT the icy face and SLIDE down the slope, clearing the path of the avalanche- and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. VAN - DAY \nIn EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van emerges from the concrete balustrade and starts FALLING- and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nArthur is still FLYING through the corridor, NOT LANDING- GRAVITY HAS DISAPPEARED... he scrambles for a handhold, GRABBING a sconce- and we- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY \nCobb watches the avalanche cloud slide past the complex. \nARIADNE What was that? \nCOBB The kick. \nEAMES (OVER RADIO) Cobb? Did we miss it? \nCOBB Yeah, we missed it. \nEXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS \nEames is lying on the snow. \nEAMES What the hell do we do now? \nCOBB (OVER RADIO) Finish the job before the next kick. \nEAMES What next kick? \nEXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS \nCobb looks at Ariadne as he talks into the radio. \nCOBB When the van hits the water. I figure Arthur's got a couple minutes and we've got about twenty. \nCobb and Ariadne MOVE towards the base of the complex. \nEXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS \nSaito and Fischer RUN around the base of the building. They find a large EXHAUST PORT. Lay a charge on the GRILL. They blow the charge. Climb into the open vent. \nCobb turns to her- \nCOBB How can you know that? \nINT. ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS \nFischer moves into the antechamber, cautious- \nFISCHER I'm in. \nFischer turns up the volume- \nARIADNE (OVER RADIO) Fischer, look out!- \nMal DROPS gracefully to the floor behind him- \nMAL Hello. \nINT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS \nCobb looks at Ariadne- \nARIADNE Cobb, she's just a projection. Fischer... he's real. \nCobb thinks.

ANTECHAMBER, HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY \nEames jumps out of the vent to find Cobb and Ariadne standing over the bodies of Fischer and Mal. \nEAMES What happened? \nARIADNE Mal killed Fischer- \nCOBB I wouldn't shoot her. \nEames grabs a defibrillator from the wall and pulls Fischer's jacket open- \nCOBB It won't do any good- \nEames SHOCKS Fischer's chest... \nCOBB Even if you could revive his body, his mind's trapped down there. It's over. \nEames listens for a pulse. Looks up at Cobb. \nEAMES So that it, then? We failed. \nCOBB I'm sorry. \nEAMES It's you who doesn't get back to your family. \nEames looks down at Fischer. Then over to the double doors. \nEAMES I wanted to know what was going to happen in there. I think we had this one. \nARIADNE There's still a way: We follow Fischer down- \nThey look at her. \nEAMES We're almost out of time- \nARIADNE Down there they'll be enough time. We'll find him-soon as you hear Arthur's music start, you use the defibrillator to revive him-we give him his own early kick from below. (MORE) ARIADNE (CONT'D) Get him in there- (points to doors) Then, as the music ends you blow the hospital and we all ride the kick back up through the layers. \nEames looks at her, then to Cobb. \nEAMES Okay, Saito can hold them off while I plant the rest of the charges. \nCOBB Saito's not going to last, Eames. \nARIADNE We have to try! \nEAMES Go for it, but I'm taking the kick whether you're back or not... \nEames pulls the mechanism from his pack. Offers it to Ariadne. Cobb watches. Silent. Ariadne pulls out the tubes- \nARIADNE Can I trust you to do what's needed? Mal's down there- \nCOBB And I can find her. She'll have Fischer. \nARIADNE How do you know? \nCOBB She wants me to come after him. She wants me back down there with her. \nCobb rolls up his sleeve. Ariadne rolls up her own sleeve. Eames NODS. Cobb and Ariadne lie down. Eames hits the button- WATER. BUBBLES. DROWNING. And we are- \nEXT. COAST (LIMBO) - DAY \nCOBB I know what's real. \nMAL What are the distinguishing characteristics of a dream? Mutable laws of physics? Tell that to the quantum physicists. Reappearance of the dead? What about heaven and hell? Persecution of the dreamer, the creator, the messiah? They crucified Christ, didn't they? \nCOBB I know what's real. \nMAL No creeping doubts? Not feeling persecuted, Dom? Chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces? The way the projections persecute the dreamer? \nMal puts her hand on his face. Pitying. \nMAL Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in one reality anymore. So choose. Choose your reality like I did. Choose to be here. Choose me. \nCOBB (rising anger) I have chosen, Mal. Our children. I have to get back to them. Because you left them. You left us. \nMAL You're wrong, Dom. You're confused... our children are here- \nA child's SHOUT draws Cobb- James CROUCHES on the porch, back to us. Philippa joins him, also turned away. Cobb watches, moved. Mal leans in close. \nMAL (whispers) And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you, Dom? \nCOBB Our real children are waiting for me up above. \nAnd we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nArthur scrambles to arrange the sleepers on the floor of the car- as his hand comes away from Saito, he sees BLOOD on it.

Philippa?! \nThe children START TO TURN to us- BUT COBB CLOSES HIS EYES. \nCOBB They're not real, Mal. Our real children are waiting for us- \nThe children run off. Cobb opens his eyes. \nMAL You keep telling yourself that but you don't believe it- \nCOBB I know it- \nMAL And what if you're wrong? What if I'm what's real? \nCobb is silent. \nMAL You keep telling yourself what you know... but what do you believe? What do you feel? \nCobb looks at Mal. Struggling. \nCOBB Guilt. I feel guilt. And however confused I might get. (MORE) COBB (CONT'D) However lost I might seem... it's always there. Telling me something. Reminding me of the truth. \nMAL What truth? \nCOBB That you were wrong to doubt our world. That the idea that drove you to question your reality was a lie... \nMAL How could you know it was a lie? \nCOBB Because it was my lie. \nMAL (realizing) Because you planted the idea in my mind. \nCOBB Because I performed inception on my own wife, then reaped the bitter rewards... \nARIADNE Why? \nCOBB We'd become lost in here. Living in a world of infinite possibilities. A world where we were gods. I realized we needed to escape, but she'd locked away her knowledge of the unreality of this world... \nINSERT CUT: Mal opens the doll's house. Takes the spinning top, lies it down in the safe.

He heads inside... \nCOBB And when I found that place, that secret place where she had shut away her knowledge years before, I broke it open... \nINSERT CUT: Cobb looks around Mal's childhood bedroom. Comes to the doll's house... \nCOBB I broke into the deepest recess of her mind, to give her the simplest little idea. \nINSERT CUT: Cobb throws open the safe doors. Sitting on the shelf of the safe is a spinning top. On its side. \nCOBB A truth that she had once known, but had chosen to forget... \nINSERT CUT: Cobb picks up the totem. He SPINS it in the safe. IT SPINS AND SPINS WITHOUT END. Cobb CLOSES THE DOOR of the safe... \nCOBB That her world was not real. \nINSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL ARRIVE AT TRAIN TRACKS CUTTING THROUGH WASTELAND. \nCOBB (V.O.) That death was a necessary escape. \nThey lie on the tracks looking into each other's eyes. Mal is crying. Cobb takes her hand, reassuring. He starts to speak- \nCOBB What're you doing? \nARIADNE Improvising. \nShe KICKS Fischer off the roof- AIMS again at Mal- \nFischer DROPS as the sky LIGHTS UP WITH ELECTRICITY- Fischer SCREAMS, then GASPS, no longer falling, and we are- \nINT.

His Father reaches out a trembling hand but when Fischer tries to hold IT, he SHAKES his son's hand away... \nHe is reaching for the SAFE next to his bed. His fingers fumble at the keypad, he can't open it. His son pushes 5,2,8,4,9,1 into the keypad. Opens it. Inside the safe is the WILL. And beside it is a HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, clearly made by a child. By Fischer. He takes it out, MARVELING at it. He turns to his father, but his father is dead. \nEames, watching from the door, HITS THE DETONATOR- \nEXT.

I'm staying here to find Saito. (turns to Mal) And to say goodbye. \nAriadne loosens her grip on the railing... \nARIADNE Don't lose yourself. Find Saito.

The Bearded Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He COLLAPSES. \nThe barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE. \nINT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER \nThe Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us. \nATTENDANT (in Japanese) He was delirious. But he asked for you by name. And... (to the Security Guard) Show him. \nSECURITY GUARD (in Japanese) He was carrying nothing but this... \nHe puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating. \nSECURITY GUARD ...and this. \nThe Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating.

A third man is at the table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch- \nARTHUR What Mr. Cobb is trying to say- \nCOBB An idea. \nSaito looks at Cobb, curious. \nCOBB Resilient, highly contagious. Once an idea's taken hold in the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. A person can cover it up, ignore it- but it stays there. \nSAITO But surely-to forget...? \nCOBB Information, yes. But an idea? Fully formed, understood? That sticks... (taps forehead) In there, somewhere. \nSAITO For someone like you to steal? \nARTHUR Yes. In the dream state, conscious defenses are lowered and your thoughts become vulnerable to theft. It's called extraction. \nCOBB But, Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extractor. \nSAITO How can you do that? \nCOBB Because I am the most skilled extractor. I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks, and I can teach them to your subconscious so that even when you're asleep, your guard is never down. \nCobb leans forwards. Holding Saito's gaze. \nCOBB But if I'm going to help you, you have to be completely open to me. I'll need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife, your analyst, anyone. (gestures around) If this is a dream and you've got a safe full of secrets, I need to know what's in that safe. For this to work, you have to let me in. \nSaito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD opens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY. \nSAITO Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I consider your proposal. \nThey watch Saito leave.

He's playing with us. \nCOBB I can get it here. The information's in the safe- he looked right at it when I mentioned secrets. \nArthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder. \nARTHUR What's she doing here, Cobb? \nCobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed, staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her. \nCOBB You just get to your room. I'll take care of the rest. \nARTHUR See that you do. We're here to work. \nArthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb. Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR- \nMAL If I jumped, would I survive? \nCOBB With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal, why are you here? \nShe turns to look at him. Amused. \nMAL I thought you might be missing me... \nShe smiles. He leans in, mesmerized. \nCOBB I am. But I can't trust you anymore. \nShe stares up at him, inviting. \nMAL So what? \nINT.

Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels at Mal's feet. She looks down at him. \nMAL Tell me... \nCobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS. \nMAL Do the children miss me? \nCobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's ankle.

Cobb gets to his feet, letting out the rope as he moves back to the window. \nMAL What're you doing? \nCobb tosses the rope out- \nCOBB Getting some air. \nHe tugs on the rope, testing.

PENROSE STEPS - LATER \nArthur leads Ariadne down some busy steps in a large glass and steel ATRIUM in an office complex. \nARTHUR You're going to have to master a few tricks if you're going to build three complete dream levels. \nA SECRETARY DROPS some papers as they pass... \nARIADNE What sort of tricks? \nThey take a tight turn and continue down the next flight. \nARTHUR In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes. (MORE) ARTHUR (CONT'D) That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps. The infinite staircase. \nAriadne FREEZES- THEY ARE IN THE EXACT SPOT THEY STARTED DESCENDING FROM, next to the Secretary gathering her papers. \nAriadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs. \nARTHUR See... \nArthur stops her gently- they are on the highest step, with a LARGE DROP to the next step. Arthur gestures at the drop. \nARTHUR Paradox. A closed loop like this helps you disguise the boundaries of the dream you've created. \nARIADNE How big do the levels have to be? \nARTHUR Anything from the floor of a building, to an entire city. But it has to be complicated enough for us to hide from the projections. \nARIADNE A maze. \nARTHUR And the better the maze- \nARIADNE The longer we have before the projections catch us. \nAriadne looks around. Sees people LOOKING at Arthur. \nARIADNE My subconscious seems polite enough. \nARTHUR You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one likes to see someone else messing around in their mind. \nARIADNE Cobb can't build anymore, can he? \nARTHUR I don't know if he can't, but he won't. He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts. \nARIADNE Why? \nARTHUR He won't tell me. I think it's Mal. I think she's getting stronger. \nARIADNE His ex-wife? \nARTHUR She's not his ex. \nARIADNE They're still together? \n", "test2_true": "ARTHUR No. No, she's dead, Ariadne.

ROOFTOP, OLD TOWN, MOMBASA - DAY \nSaito deposits a FILE in front of Cobb: PHOTOS, DOCUMENTS. As Cobb runs through them, he passes them to Eames. \nSAITO Robert Fischer, 32. Heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate. He's spent his whole life being groomed as successor-breaking up his father's empire will take a radical shift in his thinking. \nCOBB What's your problem with Fischer? \nSAITO That's not your concern. \nCOBB This isn't the usual corporate espionage, Mr. Saito. This is inception. The seed of the idea we plant will grow in this man's mind. It'll change him. It might even come to define him. \nSaito looks at Cobb. \nSAITO My sources suggest you might not have always been so cautious. \nCOBB Then you need new sources, Mr. Saito. \nSaito considers Cobb. Shrugs. \nSAITO Fischer Morrow has the regulators in their pockets. We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance and we can no longer compete. Soon they'll control the energy supply of half the world. They'll be able to blackmail governments, dictate policy. In effect, they become a new superpower. The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind. \nEAMES That's where we come in. How's Robert Fischer's relationship to his father? \nSAITO Rumor is the relationship is complicated. \nCOBB We'll need more than rumor, Mr. Saito. \nEames picks up a photo: a distinguished executive (68). \nEAMES Can you get me access to him? Browning. Fischer senior's right- hand man. Fischer junior's godfather. \nSAITO It should be possible. If you can get the right references. \nEAMES References are something of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito. \nEXT. DECREPIT BUILDING, MOMBASA - LATER \nEames leads Cobb and Saito down uneven steps to a doorway. \nINT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS \nPeeling paint, buzzing flies.

At the far end, a portly 40-year-old man rises from behind his desk, beckoning. This is YUSUF. \nYUSUF Come, come. \nEames shakes Yusuf's hand. Yusuf stops at Cobb. \nYUSUF Ah, yes. Mr. Cobb. I've heard so very much about you. (indicates chairs) please. \nYusuf chases a CAT off Saito's chair. \nYUSUF Bloody cats. \nYusuf moves to a shelf and runs his fingers over the glass bottles. None of them has a label. \nYUSUF You work using Somnacin, I think, Mr. Cobb? \nCOBB You're well informed, Mr. Yusuf. \nYusuf places a bottle on the desk in front of Cobb. \nCOBB (dubious) Somnacin? \nYUSUF (proudly) Yusuf's Somnacin. \nYusuf pulls the stopper, holds it towards Cobb's nose. \nCOBB As good as the real thing? \nYusuf WHIPS the bottle away from Cobb, offended. \nYUSUF Better. \nYusuf holds the bottle to the light, marveling. \nYUSUF Binds the dreamers tight. Let's them dream as one. Makes it real. Of course, if you'd prefer, you could use Somnacin brand. If you could explain to the international control council what you wanted it for. \nYusuf puts the bottle back onto the shelf. Sits. \nYUSUF You are seeking a chemist? (Cobb nods) To formulate compounds for a job? \nCOBB And to come into the held with us. \nYUSUF I rarely go into the held, Mr. Cobb. \nCOBB We need you there to tailor compounds to our particular requirements. \nYUSUF Which are? \nCOBB Great depth. \nYUSUF A dream within a dream? Two levels? \nCOBB Three. \nYUSUF Not possible. That many dreams within dreams would be too unstable. \nCOBB I've done it before. You just have to add a sedative. \nYUSUF A powerful sedative. How many team members? \nCOBB Five. \nSAITO Six. (to Cobb) The only way to know you've done the job is if I go in with you. \nCOBB There's no room for tourists on these jobs, Mr. Saito. \n", "test2_id": 2128, "test3_input": "The liquid in Fischer's drink RISES UP AGAINST ONE SIDE OF THE GLASS- Fischer notices, confused. \nCOBB Very odd-the weather, the gravity... \nFischer looks around the bar- it's as if THE ENTIRE ROOM IS SET AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE- glasses SLIDING off tables... \nCOBB (CONT'D) But I can explain all this. You've actually been trained for this. (Fischer nods) Think of the strangeness of the weather, the shifts in gravity. None of this is real... (MORE) COBB (CONT'D) (beat) We're in a dream. \nFischer looks at the room around them. Back to Cobb. All through the bar, patrons turn to look at Cobb IN UNISON. \nCOBB (CONT'D) The simplest test of what I'm saying is for you to try and remember anything about the way you arrived in this hotel... okay? \nFischer stares at Cobb, trying to process this. All around them, people STARE at Cobb. Several get up as if to approach. \nCOBB (CONT'D) Breathe. Remember the training. Accept the fact that we're in a dream. That's why I'm here protecting you. \nAs Fischer considers this we- \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY \nYusuf STRAIGHTENS UP the van, RACING down the street, swerving through traffic and we- \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - EVENING \nThe building gradually EASES BACK INTO ALIGNMENT- \nFISCHER So you... you're not real? \nThe bar patrons start to ignore Cobb again. \nCOBB No. I'm a projection of your subconscious. I was put in place to protect you in the event that extractors pulled you into a dream. I believe that's what has happened. \nFischer takes this in. Then looks at the Security Men approaching across the crooked floor, he nods at Cobb- \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING \nCobb escorts Fischer across the lobby. As he does so, he walks past the two CHILDREN, backs to us- Cobb ignores them- The two Sub-security fall in behind. Cobb hurries Fischer up the stairs- then PUSHES him into- \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nFischer stumbles in- turns to Cobb, angry- \nFISCHER Hey- \nCobb reaches into his jacket- the First Man BURSTS in- Cobb KICKS him to the ground- DRAWS his gun as the SECOND MAN comes through the door, moving towards Fischer- \nBLAM! Cobb BLASTS the Second Man in the back- TURNS and SHOOTS the First Man. \nFISCHER (CONT'D) Jesus Christ! What are you doing?! \nCobb turns to Fischer, calm. Convincing. \nCOBB Look at the gun in his hand. \nFischer looks: the Second Man was holding a pistol. Cobb opens the First Man's jacket to show Fischer his holster and sidearm. \nCOBB (CONT'D) These men were sent to abduct you. \nCobb pulls out the gun and HANDS it to Fischer. \nCOBB (CONT'D) If I'm going to help you, I need you to be calm. \nFischer remembers something. \nFISCHER If this is a dream, I have to kill myself and wake up- \nFischer raises the gun towards his head- \nCOBB I wouldn't do that-they've probably got you sedated. If you pull that trigger, you might not wake up, you might drop into a lower dream state. (MORE) COBB (CONT'D) Mr. Fischer, you know all this, you just have to remember it... \nFischer lowers his gun. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nSaito walks down the corridor, followed by a Security Man. Saito DUCKS around the corner, moves to a GARBAGE CHUTE and DROPS Fischer's WALLET into it. He SLIPS into the stairwell as the Security Man comes abreast of the chute and pauses. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nArthur leads Ariadne to a particular room: 491. \nINT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS \nArthur leads Ariadne in. He opens the closet, opens the room safe, pulls our FOUR BRICKS OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE. \nARTHUR So, if everything's correct, this room should be directly below 528. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCobb looks reassuringly at Fischer. \nCOBB What do you remember from before this dream? \nFISCHER (thinking) Rain... gunfire... Uncle Peter. (looks up) Christ-we've been kidnapped. \nCOBB Where were they holding you? \nFISCHER They had us... in the back of a van... \nCOBB Your body's bouncing around in the back of a van right now-that explains the gravity shifts. \nFISCHER It was... to do with a safe... Christ, why's it so hard to remember? \nCOBB It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up. It takes years of practice to do it easily. So, you and Browning have been pulled into this dream so they can steal something from your mind. What? \nFISCHER They wanted a combination to a safe... they demanded the first numbers to pop into my head. \nCOBB That's them extracting a locator. \nFISCHER A locator? \nCOBB A number from your own subconscious. It can be used any number of ways... (thinking) This is a hotel. Room numbers. What was the number you gave them? \nFISCHER 5, 2... something... it was a long number. 528... 528, 4 something. \nCOBB (opens phone) Well, we know where to start. (into phone) Fifth floor. \n", "test3_true": "Arthur hangs up the phone. He is standing on a chair, attaching the explosives to the ceiling. \nARIADNE Do you use a timer? \nARTHUR No, I have to judge it myself. Once you're all asleep up in room 528, I wait `til Yusuf starts his kick... \nARIADNE How will you know? \nARTHUR His music warns me it's coming, then the van hitting the barrier of the bridge should be unmistakable- that's when I blow the floor out from underneath us and we get a nice synchronized kick. Too soon, and we won't get pulled out; too late and I won't be able to drop us. \nARIADNE Why not? \nARTHUR The van will be in free fall. I can't drop us with no gravity. \nArthur finishes setting the charges. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nSaito moves through the lobby. Browning is coming in the other direction. Saito assumes him to be Eames. \nSAITO I see you've changed. \nBROWNING I'm sorry? \nEames comes up behind Browning, catching Saito's eye. \nSAITO I'm... I mistook you for a friend. \nBROWNING Good-looking fellow, I'm sure. \nBrowning moves off. Saito approaches Eames. \nEAMES That's Fischer's projection of Browning. We'll keep an eye on how he behaves- \nSAITO Why? \nEAMES How he acts will tell us if Fischer's starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, FIFTH FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER \nCobb leads Fischer around a corner. Arthur and Ariadne are waiting in the corridor. \nCOBB They work for me. \nFischer starts looking at room numbers. Stops at 528. Cobb draws his gun, steps back from the door and KICKS it open. \nINT. ROOM 528 - CONTINUOUS \nCobb JUMPS into the room, gun up. The room is empty. Arthur and Ariadne search the room. Saito and Eames arrive. Eames shuts the door. Arthur FINDS something- \nARTHUR Mr. Charles! \nArthur holds up a MECHANISM CASE. Cobb shows it to Fischer. \nCOBB You know what this is? \nFischer's eyes roam over the dials and plungers. \nFISCHER I think so. But I don't understand. \nCOBB They were going to put you under. \nFISCHER I'm already under. \nCOBB Under again. \nFISCHER A dream within a dream? \nARTHUR Shhhh! \nArthur is at the door. Someone is there. A key goes into the lock- the door starts to open- Arthur REACHES OVER and GRABS the person entering, THROWS THEM TO THE FLOOR- puts his gun in their face. IT IS BROWNING. \nFischer stares, disbelieving, at his own godfather. \nFISCHER Uncle Peter. What's going on? \nCobb pulls the key from Browning's hand: ROOM 528. \nCOBB You said you were kidnapped together? \nFISCHER Not exactly, they already had him. They'd been torturing him... \nCOBB You saw them torture him? \nFischer shakes his head. Looks at Browning. Thinking. \nFISCHER The kidnappers are working for you. \nBROWNING No, Robert- \nFISCHER You're trying to get that safe open. To get the alternate will. \nBrowning looks up at Fischer. \nBROWNING Fischer Morrow's been my entire life. I can't let you destroy it. \nFISCHER I'm not going to throw away my inheritance. Why would I? \nBROWNING I couldn't take the chance of you rising to your father's final taunt. \nFISCHER What taunt? \nBROWNING That will. I'm sorry, Robert, but it's his final insult. A challenge to build something for yourself. He's telling you that you aren't worthy of his achievements. \nFischer takes this in. Devastated. \nFISCHER That he was \"disappointed?\" \nBROWNING I'm so sorry. But he was wrong. You'll make his company even greater than he ever could. \nCOBB Your godfather's lying, Robert. \nFischer turns to Cobb. \nFISCHER How do you know? \nCOBB It's what I do. He's hiding something. \nCobb looks at Browning. \n", "test3_id": 2129}

There is a long silence, terribly heavy. 
Finally, Lipnik explodes  at Lou. 
LIPNIK You lousy sonofabitch! You're telling this man  this ARTIST  what to do?! 
Lou Breeze is stunned. 
LOU Mr. Lipnik, I  
LIPNIK This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired! 
Barton is staring, aghast. 
BARTON Mr. Lipnik, that's not really necessar- 
Lipnik, still staring at Lou, gives no sign of hearing Barton. He rises and points. 
LIPNIK Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet! 
LOU Mr. Lipnik, please  
BARTON I  Mr. Lipnik  
LIPNIK KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!! 
Lou, aghast, looks at Barton. 
Barton, aghast, can only return the same stunned look. 
Lipnik snarls at Lou: 
LIPNIK ...Okay, get out of here. You're fired, you understand me?  Get out of my sight. 
Lou gets stiffly to his feet and stumbles away. 
BARTON Mr. Lipnik, I  
LIPNIK I apologize, Barton. 
BARTON No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help  
LIPNIK You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business. 
BARTON Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider  
LIPNIK Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts. 
He gets down on his knees in front of Barton. 
LIPNIK ...You know in the old country we were taught, as very young children, that there's no shame in supplicatin' yourself when you respect someone. 
Barton stares, horrified, at Lipnik, on the ground at his feet. 
LIPNIK ...On behalf of Capitol Pictures, the administration, and all a the stockholders, please accept this as a symbol of our apology and respect. 
BARTON'S POV 
Lipnik kisses his shoe and looks up at him. 
Behind Lipnik the pool glitters. 
BARTON'S ROOM 
The cut has a hard musical sting. Out of the sting comes a loud but distorted thumping noise. 
We are looking down, high angle, form one corner of the room. We are presented with a motionless tableau: Barton sits, hunched, in the far corner, elbows on knees, staring at the bed in front of him. He wears only trousers and a T-shirt and his body and face glisten with sweat. The bed's sheets have been stripped and the ratty gray mattress has an enormous rust-red stain in the middle. 
After a beat, in the foreground, the only motion in the scene: A bead of tacky yellow wall-sweat dribbles down the near wall. 
Silence, then the thumping repeats, resolving itself to a knock at the door. 
Barton rises slowly and crosses to the door. 
THE DOOR 
Barton opens it to Charlie, who is dressed in a baggy suit, his hair slicked back, a tan fedora pushed back on his head. It is the first time we have seen him well turned out. 
A battered briefcase is on the floor next to him. He holds a parcel in his left hand, about one foot square, wrapped in brown paper and tied up with twine. 
CHARLIE Barton. Can I come in? 
Barton stands back from the door and Charlie picks up his briefcase and enters. 
THE ROOM 
As the two men enter. 
BARTON Jesus... You're leaving. 
CHARLIE Have to, old timer. Just for a while. 
Barton sounds desperate:

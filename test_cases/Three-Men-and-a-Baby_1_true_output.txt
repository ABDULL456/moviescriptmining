63   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                       63 Michael comes into the living room with his box of diapers and a bag of groceries. In addition to the two cops there are now THREE NARCOTIC AGENTS who are interrogating Peter. He is holding Mary. The basket is on an armchair. MICHAEL Hello, Officers... What's going on? PETER Don't worry, Michael, it's nothing serious, just a little misunderstanding. MICHAEL Did you give her the 5:30 bottle? PETER Yeah, I just gave it to her. 
MICHAEL Did you change her? PETER No, she's soaking wet. 
MICHAEL Okay, I'll do it. Michael puts down his bag of groceries, takes Mary from Peter and disappears with the box of diapers. In his room, he lays Mary down on his bed and starts undressing her. 
64   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                    64 AGENT #1 And who's he? PETER He's my roommate. AGENT #1 (raising an eyebrow) Oh, I see, I see... PETER No, you don't see. There are three of us sharing this place. AGENT #1 Oh, three, huh? A regular 'mirage a trois'! PETER It's 'menage'... and it's not. We all have lots of girlfriends, thank you. AGENT #1 Uh-huh, so what's your friend do? PETER He's a cartoonist. AGENT #1 What about the other guy? PETER He's a pilot. AGENT #1 Ah-hah... Now that's interesting... (to his colleague) 
... Get me those photographs, the ones taken at Newark Airport. Agent #1 looks in his attache case. AGENT #1 So does this friend of yours ever fly to South America? PETER No.   Never.   Only North America. The PHONE RINGS. AGENT #1 Would you object if I answered it for you? PETER Not at all, go right ahead.    I've got nothing to hide. Agent #1 picks up the phone and listens. AGENT    #1 It's a collect call    from a Jack Collins in La Paz,    Bolivia. That wouldn't happen to    be your pilot friend, would it?     The one who never goes to South    America? PETER Yes, it is him. Agent #1 hands him the phone. PETER Hello, yes, operator, I accept the charges. Agent #1 gestures to Agent #3 to take a look around the apartment. Agent #3 slips away. AGENT #1 Would you mind very much if I listened? PETER Please, go right ahead. Agent #1 picks up the other telephone. PETER Hello, Jack? Fine, yeah. How're you? Yeah, he's fine, too. Yeah, we left a message for you, right... No, it was nothing 
special, it was just, I mean... to see how you were doing and all ... No, no emergency. Everything's fine. PETER (CONT'D) (loud) I said everything's fine! The what?... I don't know what you're talking about... Oh yeah, the package! Yeah, yeah, it got here ... and was picked up, uh-huh. Hey! Why didn't you call sooner? Huh? 'Cause what?... Oh, you're onto something hot -- well, aren't you the lucky one!... So when are you getting married?... Forget it, I was just kidding... Well, everything's fine up here. So have a good time. See you in a couple of weeks. 'Bye. Peter hangs up.   So does Agent #1. AGENT #1 Now that's interesting. So you wanna tell me about this package and the hot something-or-other your friend lucked onto... in La Paz... Bolivia... South America? Peter sits down, stunned. 
65   INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - DAY                                  65 Mary is lying on Michael's bed. He has just finished putting a regular diaper on her. Then Michael looks for the tampered-with diaper in the box. He finds it, checks that it is well-sealed, and places it under Mary's bottom. Just then Agent #3 appears in the doorway. Michael calmly finishes putting the dope-filled diaper on the baby on top of the other one. MARY is COOING. Every- thing appears normal. However, a trained eye might be very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper covering the young lady's backside. But a narcotics agent is not necessarily the most qualified person to notice something odd like this. Agent #3 silently observes Michael, who gives him a big smile as he slips on Mary's pajama bottoms. Michael picks Mary up and for the first time talks to her in the kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents. 
MICHAEL Okey-dokey, honeybunch, it's time to go beddy-bye now... We're gonna take a nice long nappy-wappy... He goes back to the living room, followed by Agent #3. 
Agent #1 is in the process of showing Peter a photograph. AGENT #1 Do you recognize anyone in this picture? Peter looks: it's the photo of Jack and Paul that was taken at the beginning of the movie.

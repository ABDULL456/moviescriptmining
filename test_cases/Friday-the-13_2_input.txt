JACK turns to BILL. 
JACK Give me a hand? 
BILL For sure. 
CUT TO: 
61    INT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON 
JACK steps in and, in CU, we see there is a puddle where he is standing.  The puddle is somehow significant. 
BILL leans over JACK's shoulder to see what he's doing. 
BILL This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine. 
JACK Here we go. 
The CAMERA watches JACK's actions tightly.  In a REVERSE POV we see JACK's tongue come out the side of his mouth as he concentrates.  He bites down on it. 
ANOTHER ANGLE:  as JACK pulls the starter cord.  The engine roars into action. 
JACK (yelling) Now ya' close the switch. 
CU as JACK's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal switch.  A spark arcs and we PULL BACK to see JACK with a perfect connection running through his body.  There is a sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, JACK screams, the generator chugs roughly.  Hundreds of volts are streaking through JACK's body and grounded through his wet shoes. 
BILL reacts quickly:  knowing better than to touch him and continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop- kick on his friend, severing the contact. 
JACK stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead.  The machine stops. 
CUT TO: 
62    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON 
JACK lands, almost unconscious.  BILL kneels into FRAME and cheeks JACK's vital sign:  his eyes, his carotid pulse, his breathing. 
JACK shakes his head. 
JACK I'll be okay.  Holy shit... 
BILL Don't get up.  Take a second... 
JACK lies back down.  Covers his eyes with his arm. 
JACK You saved my life. 
BILL I had to. 
JACK Thanks. 
BILL I figured if I didn't save you.  I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite. 
JACKS looks up and smiles.  BILL give him a hand and the groggy athlete gets to his feet. 
JACK Whew. 
Satisfied that JACK won't fall down, BILL goes to the shed and looks in. 
We can look in over BILL's shoulder and see a smoke-scarred switch and a now-silent generator. 
BILL This puddle was enough to ground you all the way to China. 
JACK looks in, too. 
JACK Floor probably leaks.  This area is full of springs. 
BILL A short somewhere.

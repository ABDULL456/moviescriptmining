{"train": "the Ghost and the Darkness - by William Goldman \n\"THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS\" \nby \nWilliam Goldman \nFADE IN ON \nA TINY FIGURE OF A MAN hurrying toward camera. The figure gets larger as he approaches. But as yet we cannot tell who he is or where we are. \nMALE VOICE (over) This is the most famous true story of Africa. It happened a hundred years ago, but even now, when children ask about it, you do not tell them at night. (The FIGURE continues to grow) It began with the race to build a railroad across Africa. (beat) But this is not about building a railroad- it is about Patterson. \nAnd now we can tell that the FIGURE is a YOUNG MAN, A LIEUTENANT COLONEL. This is PATTERSON. He is gifted and bright and serious, serious about his life, serious about his career. He has been successful in everything he's attempted, in part because of his talents, in part because he is willing to outwork anybody. \nAND THIS IS WHERE WE ARE: ENGLAND. \nMore specifically, in a high-ceilinged corridor of an elegant building - lovely woodwork all around. Everything is neat, everything is clean and in order. \nMALE VOICE (over) Patterson was thirty. A brilliant engineer. A fine man, but do not become attached to him- there are many fine men in this story but do not become attached to any of them. (beat) So many of them die. \nPatterson stops at a large ornate door, knocks. Waits. \nMALE VOICE (over) And remember this: only the impossible parts of what follows really happened... (Now the door opens and we-) \nCUT TO \nJust a wonderfully handsome man standing in the doorway. This is ROBERT BEAUMONT - 40, with an irresistable smile. We're in his office and the place reflects the man - clean, cold. There are maps and charts on the walls. He ushers Patterson inside. \nBEAUMONT (The great smile flashes) John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont. (They shake hands) Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you- (beat) -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree. (Surprised, uncomfortable, Patterson nods) Winning personality, heaps of charm? \nPATTERSON My wife is the game player in the family, sir. \nBEAUMONT Games? (staring dead at Patterson) Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself. (again the smile - only now it's chilling) One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, as he realizes Beaumont is serious. Beaumont turns sharply and moves to a large map. \nCUT TO \nTHE MAP. It covers a great deal of East Africa with a very clear line that ends at Lake Victoria, a distance of some 600 miles. \nBEAUMONT (pointing along the line) We are building this railroad across Africa for the glorious purpose of saving Africa from the Africans. And, of course, to end slavery. The Germans and French are our competition. We are ahead, and we will stay ahead providing you do what I hired you to do- \nCUT TO \nA MORE DETAILED MAP. This one ends at \"Tsavo,\" 130 miles in. \nBEAUMONT -build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that? \nPATTERSON I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge. \nBEAUMONT You've never built in Africa. \nPATTERSON But I have in India- every country presents problems. \nBEAUMONT You'll need your confidence, I promise you. \nPATTERSON I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes. \nBEAUMONT Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me. (beat) But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment- (the smile) -don't make me break you. \nPATTERSON (smiling right back) You won't have the chance. (glancing at his watch) Any further words of encouragement? (silence) Then I've a train to catch. \nThey look at each other a moment in silence - and it's very clear they do not like each other. Patterson turns, leaves and we \nCUT TO \nA RAILWAY STATION, IMMEDIATELY AFTER \nA train is loading up. A lot of activity, a lot of noise. Patterson stands in the midst of it, anxiously looking around. \nCUT TO \nHELENA PATTERSON, hurrying through the crowd. Early 20s, with the kind of serene beauty of Jean Simmons. She is still slim, has not begun to show. She spots him, puts a smile on, goes straight into his arms. \nHELENA I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone. \nPATTERSON (They are nutty about each other - he nods) We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena. \nHELENA (brightly) Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you? \nPATTERSON It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments. \nThey start to walk hand in hand along the platform toward a quieter place. Patterson is suddenly very serious- \nHELENA Oh dear- (beat) -you're geting that downtrodden look again- \nPATTERSON -well, it's just... (beat) ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time- \nHELENA (not unkindly) -oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life. \nPATTERSON What if there are complications?- \nHELENA -not \"what if\"- there will be, there always are. Which only means that our \"son\" and I- note my confidence- will have an excuse to come visit. \nTHE TRAIN WHISTLE sounds. \nHELENA Go, now. (He kisses her hand) Such a gentleman. (Now he holds her) \nPATTERSON I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving. \nCUT TO \nHELENA. She hates it, too. \nHELENA You build bridges, John- (beat) -you've got to go where the rivers are. \nThey hold each other a moment more, then break, then back into each other's arms a final time, then- \nCUT TO \nTHE TRAIN, and thick clouds of steam- \nSTARLING (laughs) I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here? \nPATTERSON (looks at his watch) Almost three hours. (beat) But I've been getting ready all my life. (Now, from them-) \nCUT TO \nA BUNCH OF IMPOVERISHED-LOOKING NATIVE WOMEN. They hold children who wave at the passing train. The children are more impoverished looking than their mothers. \nSTARLING (suddenly touched) Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls. \nPATTERSON Beaumont says it's to end slavery. \nSTARLING (shrugs) We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes- (interrupts himself) -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me. \nPATTERSON (They really like each other) Have you got that in writing? (Starling, amazingly good natured, laughs. And now-) \nCUT TO \nA WHITE CLAW. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nHundreds of white claws. \nKEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL \nThey aren't claws at all, they're thorns as sharp as claws and they're on a twenty-foot high thorn tree. \nAnd there are dozens of those trees, packed together. All mixed in with other trees, low and stunted, and thick underbrush and baked red rocks- \n-now the train begins to slow. \nSmoke drifts across. \nA bunch of wildebeest scatter off the tracks. \nSTARLING (over) Welcome to Tsavo. (on the word) \nCUT TO \nTSAVO. \nWe have arrived at the train station area and what we see is a place that is still being built. There are tin shacks; a water tower is under construction- \n-men are working everywhere, for that's what Tsavo is: a place for work. \nTHE TRAIN goes slower still. \nNo one stands idly around here. \nBut no one looks happy either. \nONE MAN is apart from the rest: this is SAMUEL. \nAn ageless Masai, tall and slender, he has a smile that can light the world. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND STARLING as they step off the train. \nSTARLING (indicating Samuel, who is approaching) Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts. \nPATTERSON (softly) Does he speak English? \nSAMUEL (not softly enough) And very poor French. \nSTARLING (introducing) Samuel- John Patterson. \nSAMUEL (as they shake) The bridgebuilder- (gesturing to the working men) -we have been getting ready for you. \nPATTERSON Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? (Samuel nods) \nSTARLING I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. (starting off) \nSAMUEL I will bring him, Nigel. \nWe should realize by now that Samuel's was the voice we heard at the very beginning of the picture. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL, starting to walk. They pass the water tower. \nStanding on top of it in a precarious position is an extremely powerful INDIAN. He waves to Samuel who waves back. This is SINGH. \nWORKERS study Patterson as he moves by. Not smiling. Up ahead, some SIKHS are erecting tents. Not smiling. \nPATTERSON Why do the workers look unhappy? \nSAMUEL Because they are here. (beat) Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world. (He points ahead) Come, John- to the bridge. (And on that-) \nCUT TO \nTHE RAILROAD TRACKS as the camera pans along. \nCUT TO \nTHE RIVER in the distance as they walk toward it. \nAnd here is as good a place as any to explain just what the spot where the movie takes place was like. \nThere were five hundred men working for Patterson. And they lived in a spread out area. A bunch of Indian coolies who might have come from the same town back in their country might choose to live in one cluster of tents. A group of natives might be in another cluster. \nWhat we have then, as far as living places are concerned, are dozens of clusters of tents. (Eventually, as the terror began, these areas all got surrounded, each with its own thorn fence.) \nThe places we'll come to know best are, among others, Patterson's living area, the hospital tent area, the area by the river where the bridge is to be built, etc., etc. \nAs they move, Samuel points out various camps. \nA SECT OF INDIANS is getting ready for prayer. \nANOTHER SECT OF INDIANS is eating. \nA GROUP OF AFRICANS are cleaning their tent area. \nAnyway, you get the idea. Just remember that the place covered a wide expanse, maybe a mile square, maybe more. \nPATTERSON Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl. \nHe goes into his tent with some books now and we go with him. There is a photo of Helena on a small table. A photo of an ELDERLY COUPLE, clearly his parents. His clothes are stacked with precision. He arranges his books precisely too. \nClearly, John Patterson is a man who believes in order. \nSTARLING (calling out) You said \"of course\" you'd need the donkey. Why \"of course\"? \nPATTERSON (taking a rifle, moving outside) We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up. \nCUT TO \nSTARLING, sipping his tea and there's no hiding it, he's excited. But also a bit reluctant. \nSTARLING I don't suppose I could watch. \nPATTERSON (delighted) Might be exciting for you. \nSTARLING I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way? \nPATTERSON I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life. \nSTARLING (gathering courage) Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced. (standing, teacup in hand) Why not, indeed! (Now from that-) \nCUT TO \nA SLIGHTLY WOUNDED DONKEY \nIt's roped loosely to a tree, bells around its neck. When it moves, they make a sound. Middle of the night. A night wind. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nWe're in a clearing with thick trees all around. \nKEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL \nPATTERSON AND STARLING, seated uncomfortably in a tree on the edge of the clearing, twelve feet up in the air. Patterson has his rifle ready. This next is all whispered. \nSTARLING (embarrassed) I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse. (Pulls up his trousers- his leg is knotted) The pain is actually quite unbearable now. \nPATTERSON Shhh. \nSTARLING I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but- \nPATTERSON (interrupting) -you'll have to deal with it, Nigel. \nSTARLING That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. (And he begins to climb down) \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, grabbing him. \nPATTERSON They own the night- nobody moves when there's a man-eater out there. \nStarling glumly obeys. Then- \nSTARLING John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but- \nPATTERSON What? \nSTARLING Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions? \nPATTERSON Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one. \nCUT TO \nSTARLING, not pleased with this news. He massages his calf, tries to get comfortable, which is impossible. Patterson just stares at the night. \nCUT TO \nJUST BEFORE DAWN \nThe donkey dozes. So does Starling. Patterson has not so much as moved. \nNow the bushes behind the donkey shake just a little. \nAnd the donkey is suddenly awake and scared- \n-and then it all goes crazy- the donkey screams and a lion appears from the bushes and Patterson fires one shot and the sound EXPLODES- \n-and Starling topples from the tree to the ground, landing shocked but unhurt- \n-he has landed close to the dead lion- he stares at it. \nSTARLING (amazed) ...one shot... \nPATTERSON (even more amazed) So that's what a lion looks like. (Now from the tree-) \nCUT TO \nTHE HOSPITAL TENT AREA - JUST AFTER DAWN \nHOLD for a moment. \nSAMUEL (over) One shot- one- \nKEEP HOLDING \nNow Samuel comes walking into the shot, really excited- \n-it's the first time we've seen his wonderful smile. \nSAMUEL Patterson has made the nights safe again. \nKEEP HOLDING FOR JUST A MOMENT MORE. \nAs he walks on, behind him come THREE COOLIES carrying the body of the lion. As dozens of men come running in from all over to see the dead man-eater- \nSAMUEL (mimes shooting) BOOM! (Now as the crowd continues to grow-) \nCUT TO \nA ROUGH ENGINEER'S DRAWING OF WHAT WILL BE THE BRIDGE \nIt has two embankments on either side of the river. \nPATTERSON, as the wind continues to blow. He continues to stare at the spot where the pattern stopped. \nCUT TO \nSINGH. As before. Except for one thing: suddenly, he begins to shiver, as if from cold. \nCUT TO \nTHE BUILDING SEQUENCE \nAnd what we see are a lot of cuts of a lot of activity. \nHuge wooden logs are carried in and hammered to each other and driven deep into the ground- the framework for the embankments. \nAnd Singh carries the heaviest loads and leads the workers- and as the structure rises, he is the one darting along the top, high in the air, pulling more logs up, helping here, helping there. \nAnd alongside him is his assistant, ABDULLAH, a little man with glasses and very bright eyes. \nMeanwhile, Starling is leading construction on the embankment that is on the far side of the river. And he does his best, tries to help on the top part as it rises- but alas, he is a bit on the clumsy side and balance is a problem for him. But he stays with it, does well. \nAnd Patterson, in tremendous spirits, helps when needed, but mostly he is dealing with other aspects of the bridge- such as the placements of the three stone foundation pillars- \n-he wades into the water, climbs the structures, takes it all in- and at the start he is still in the uniform he has worn since the start of the story- but it's clumsy for labor- \n-so he changes halfway through to civilian clothes- \n-which is all he wears from now on. \nAnd the workers tire in the heat- but Singh keeps them going, working with the power of three- \n-and there are accidents and explosions, injuries and falls- and Hawthorne appears when needed to help with the wounded- \n-it's hard, brutal work- \n-but gradually, the wooden structure part is finished- two huge skeletons facing each other across the Tsavo River- and now work on the roadbed is going full blast and in the river, the three foundation pillars are taking shape- \nCUT TO \nTONS OF RED ROCK- being shoved into the wooden skeleton to complete the embankments. As this goes on- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL in the river- the foundation pillar work is going very quickly. \nPatterson stops working, looks across the river- \n-movement in the grassy area on the far side. \nCUT TO \nSEVERAL NANDI TRIBESMEN as they rise out of the grass, gesture to Samuel who gestures back. The Nandi are a tribe of powerful little men, primitive, with teeth that have been sharpened to points. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL watching them. \nPATTERSON What are they looking at? \nSAMUEL You- they cannot believe you're still here. \nPATTERSON Nonsense. \nSAMUEL You don't know what Tsavo means, do you? (Patterson doesn't) It means \"slaughter\"... \nCUT TO \nTHE NANDI TRIBESMEN, staring at Patterson, shaking their heads. \nCUT TO \nTHE TWO EMBANKMENTS, as more and more red rock is shoved and pushed into shape. \nCUT TO \nTHE THREE FOUNDATION PILLARS- almost finished. \nCUT TO \nTHE ROADBED. The same. \nCUT TO \nTHE NEAR EMBANKMENT as still more rock is forced in and \nCUT TO \nTHE FAR EMBANKMENT done at last- \nCUT TO \n-and Singh stands on the top of the near one while across the river, Patterson pulls Starling to the top of the other. \nAnd they all look at each other- the embankments are both finished- THE THREE OF THEM are flying- \n-and what they do is this: hold their hands out toward each other, in Singh's gesture. It's kind of become their password. \nHOLD. A big moment for them all! \nCUT TO \nSINGH'S TENT AREA \nHe sits around a fire and the man is exhausted. His dinner plate is beside him, untouched. He's too tired to eat. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON'S TENT AREA \nStarling is there, getting ready for bed. He's wiped out, too. \nCUT TO \nSINGH, going into his tent, lying down, breathing deep. \nCUT TO \nSTARLING I am immune to your disdain. (He looks at them now) When I came here, I had but one small goal: to convert the entire continent of Africa. (shakes his head) Now I've decided to move on to something really difficult: I will not rest until both of you are safely in the fold. \nSAMUEL I've had four wives, good luck. \nSTARLING The struggle is the glory... (HOLD ON the three friends) \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, the next morning, working with Abdullah and some others at the bridge. \nCUT TO \nSTARLING completing work on the fence from the day before. It's high and taut and he's done a terrific job. \nCUT TO \nTSAVO STATION \nA BUNCH OF OTHER MEN are working near a large grassy field. One of the men starts a chant. The others pick it up. It's really pretty. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON wading into the river- he stops as the sound of the chant comes distantly to him on the wind. \nCUT TO \nTHE WORKMEN CHANTING LOUDER. It's turning into a stunner of a day- glorious blue sky broken up by pale clouds. \nCUT TO \nSTARLING. Pauses briefly, listening to the sound of the men. \nCUT TO \nTHE MEN WORKING AND SINGING. As before. \nCUT TO \nTHE GRASSY FIELD. As before- \n-except it isn't. Because if you looked carefully, something flicked in a 180 degree arc. No telling what it was, it was gone too quickly. \nCUT TO \nTHE MEN WORKING, SINGING ON. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON waist deep in the river, listening to the sound of the men, of the birds. The sun is higher in the sky. \nCUT TO \nTHE GRASSY FIELD- \n-and here it comes again, only the other way this time, flicking back in another 180 degree arc- \n-still hard to tell for sure what it was but maybe it was this: a tail. Now quickly- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON wading out of the river as Samuel comes into view. He holds an envelope. \nSAMUEL For you. \nPATTERSON (taking it) Thank you, Samuel. \nSAMUEL (watching as Patterson opens it) Good news? \nPATTERSON (glancing at the letter) I expect so- it's from my wife. \nSAMUEL Do you love her? \nPATTERSON I do, actually; very much. \nSAMUEL (his wonderful smile) You give me hope, John. (As he walks away-) \nCUT TO \nSTARLING, probing at the thorn fence, searching out any last weaknesses. \nBehind him now, in the tall grass, something moves. \nStarling, intent on his work, notices nothing. \nCUT TO \nTHE SINGING MEN, getting more and more into it. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, by the river, reading the letter. \nThere is a large tree up the riverbank. It casts a large shadow. \nIn the shadow now, something moves. \nPatterson, intent on his reading, notices nothing. \nHELENA (over) Darling one- the big excitement yesterday was when some school- children spotted a whale- (pause) -they were looking at me, John- \nCUT TO \nHELENA, in their bedroom, moving across to the window, staring out. She now has a considerable stomach. \nHELENA That was an attempt at humor but I don't feel very funny these days. I miss you terribly and after our son- I still have total confidence- well, after he's born I think travel might be broadening. As he kicks me at night I'm quite sure he's telling me he definitely wants to come to Africa. (pause) Thought you might need reminding. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON by the river. He smiles, folds the letter. Now- \nCUT TO \nTHE SINGING WORKMEN at Tsavo station- and they sense how good they sound, and they really concentrate on it, on making that sound even better- \n-there must be twenty of them, working and singing- \nCUT TO \nSTARLING, doing the same and \nCUT TO \nTHE WHITE LION, growling louder and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, taking aim and \nCUT TO \nSAMUEL, crying out and pointing and suddenly we're into super slow motion- \n-Samuel has pointed back toward the roof of the shed and- \n-and this thing is suddenly there- \n-this huge dark thing and it seems to suddenly appear from the flat roof of the shed and \nCUT TO \nTHE SUN, blocked out as this dark thing moves across it, fully stretched, it seems to go on forever and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, turning around to see and \nCUT TO \nSTARLING, turning too, and we're coming back into regular motion now as we \nCUT TO \nThis enormous BLACK-MANED LION diving into the three, sending them all sprawling and \nCUT TO \nTHE WHITE MANED LION roaring and \nCUT TO \nTHE BLACK MANED LION roaring, running to the other and \nCUT TO \nTHE TWO LIONS IN CLOSE UP. \nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, for that is how they will be referred to- \n-and The Ghost has blood and bits of flesh on its mouth- \n-The Darkness has eyes that are crazed- \n-they are destruction bringers, these two, they can kill the old and the young and the fat and the strong- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, lying in pain, dazed, shoulder bleeding, trying to reach for his rifle and \nCUT TO \nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, the white and the black, as they move toward the field of tall grass, roaring and \nCUT TO \nSAMUEL, lying in pain, his leg is bleeding and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON'S RIFLE and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, as he reaches it, manages to lift it and the roaring sounds are deafening now and \nCUT TO \nTHE TWO GIGANTIC MALES, backing into the tall grass- \n-they roar one final time- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, gun ready to fire but it's futile and he knows it as we \nCUT TO \nTHE TALL GRASS and they're gone, the grass is full of moving patterns from the wind- that's all we see- just the grass blowing this way, that way- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, staggering to his feet, staring at the grassy field. \nPATTERSON (dazed) Jesus, two of them... \nCUT TO \nSAMUEL. Dazed too. He points. Patterson registers, turns and \nCUT TO \nSTARLING, LYING DEAD, his throat ripped open. HOLD briefly on the young man, then- \nCUT TO \nTHE STATION AREA \nA train from Mombassa is slowly pulling in. And things are fairly chaotic- there is the usual activity of what is ordinarily one of the busier parts in camp- \n-but now, something new has been added: Abdullah is there with several dozen coolies who work under his command. THey are waiting for the train. \nPatterson and Samuel are there too- and at the moment, Abdullah and Patterson are in the middle of a screamer- first one of them walking away, then coming back, then the other doing the same. \nCUT TO \nHALF A DOZEN NATIVES CARRYING STARLING'S COFFIN. They start to put it on the train and as they do- \nCUT TO \nBEAUMONT. Stunned. And furious! He storms off the train and we- \nCUT TO \nTHE BRIDGE \nas Beaumont sees it. Patterson and Samuel are with him. \nLittle more work has been done than the last time we saw it. A few men are working slowly. \nAnd now there are guards with rifles patrolling it. \nCUT TO \nBEAUMONT. A deadly look at them. He storms off. \nCUT TO \nTHE HOSPITAL \nas Beaumont sees it- Patterson, Samuel, and Hawthorne stand quietly. \nIt's much more crowded than the last time. Still under control, but barely. \nBeaumont is icy now. He gestures sharply toward Hawthrone to join them. \nCUT TO \nOUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL \nTHE FOUR MEN speak low and fast- \nBEAUMONT What in hell is going on? \nSAMUEL The Ghost and The Darkness have come. \nBEAUMONT (snapping) In English. \nPATTERSON It's what the natives are calling the lions- (beat) -two lions have been causing trouble- \nBEAUMONT -what's the surprise in that, this is Africa? \nPATTERSON It hasn't been that simple so far. \nBEAUMONT What have they done besides kill Starling? (beat) How many have they killed? (Patterson nods for Hawthorne to answer) \nCUT TO \nHAWTHORNE. Doing his best. \nHAWTHORNE Well, of course, I can't supply a totally accurate answer because there are those that are actually authenticated and there are those that we once thought were workers killing each other or deserting from camp so any number I give is subject to error- \nBEAUMONT (cutting through) How many? \nHAWTHORNE Thirty, I should think. \nBEAUMONT (stunned) Christ! (whirling on Patterson) What are you doing about it? (Now from there-) \nCUT TO \nSOMETHING VERY ODD: \nWe are looking at a small railroad car in a deserted area. This is not near the track but off by itself, in an area surrounded by thorn trees. \nSeveral workers are erecting a cloth tent to cover it, trying to disguise the fact that the small railroad car is, indeed, nothing but a small railroad car. \nIt is difficult work and they are perspiring heavily. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nPATTERSON AND BEAUMONT looking at it. \nBEAUMONT This is supposed to be salvation? (staring at Patterson) What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here? \nPATTERSON (keeping control) I'm calling it my \"contraption\"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door. \nCUT TO \nTHE RAILROAD CAR. There is, in fact, an open front door. Patterson gestures for Beaumont to follow him inside. \nCUT TO \nINSIDE THE CAR AS THEY ENTER. It has been divided in half by thick metal bars from floor to ceiling. The bars are close together, only a few inches between them. \nPATTERSON In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off- (points to the open doorway) -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor. \nBEAUMONT (The smile is back) Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him. \nPatterson nods. Beaumont explodes. \nBEAUMONT Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it? \nPATTERSON I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger. \nBEAUMONT (incredulous) And it worked? \nPATTERSON (He hates to say this) In point of fact, it didn't. (hurrying on) But I'm convinced the theory is sound. \nCUT TO \nTHE TWO OF THEM. They move outside. The tension between them is considerable. Beaumont looks at Patterson for too long a moment. \nPATTERSON What? \nBEAUMONT I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. (Silence. Then-) \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. CLOSE UP. \nTHE BRIDGE AGAIN AS NIGHT FALLS - MORE CROWDED THAN BEFORE. \nSTILL MORE MEN are moving into the river. They wade til the water is up to their necks. Then they reach out, hold hands, start to sing. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON moving high into a tree. He listens to the sound. Lovely. \nCUT TO \nMOONLIGHT ON THE WATER. The men stand as before, singing softly. The river here is calm, no current to speak of. The men are safe- \n-or rather they should be. \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS swimming softly, his great jaws silently encircling the neck of the last man in line, pulling him silently away and as the others start to scream- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, watching another flare rise, helplessly listening. \nCUT TO \nA CATTLE PEN. THE CATTLE ARE NERVOUS- \n-one of them kicks wildly at the wind. \nThey should be nervous- \n-The Ghost walks among them, chooses which one to kill, leaps on it, brings it to earth as the dust rises. \nCUT TO \nANOTHER FLARE IN THE NIGHT. \nCUT TO \nTHE HOSPITAL. DAY. PACKED. \nHAWTHORNE seems overwhelmed. \nCUT TO \nSOMETHING. \nAnd for a moment we don't know what it is. There is a faint light and now we see what it is we're looking at: a wire. \nHOLD ON THE WIRE. \nAnd now a paw walks across it- \n-and the instant that happens- \nCUT TO \nTHE THREE COOLIES, the brothers, in the contraption, two of them asleep, a flickering lamp the only illumination in the railroad car and \nCUT TO \nTHE DOOR OF THE RAILROAD CAR slamming loudly down and \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nTHE DARKNESS, standing alone in one half of the railroad car- it's incredible, just incredible but Patterson's idea actually worked and \nKEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL \nThe entire of the car- the thick bars separating the two halves. In one half, the huge lion. In the other, the three armed, tough coolies. \nFor a moment, it could be a frozen tableau- both sides are too startled and surprised to do anything but stare- \n-and then all hell just explodes as we \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, and this incredible roar comes from his throat, the kind of roar that can be heard five miles away in the night but this one in the enclosed room sounds even louder and more terrifying and \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, throwing his huge body at the bars and \nCUT TO \nTHE BARS and both his front claws are slashing through and \nCUT TO \nTHE THREE TOUGH COOLIES and they retreat against the rear wall of the car. \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, rage building, throwing its body at the bars again and \nCUT TO \nTHE COOLIES, pressed in fear against the far wall, unable to do anything but stare and \nCUT TO \nTHE CLAWS, ripping at the air and \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, leaping forward, smashing into the bars and \nCUT TO \nTHE CEILING WHERE THE BARS are connected and the sheer power of his leap has made them jiggle just the least bit and \nCUT TO \nTHE COOLIES, staring up at the ceiling and \nCUT TO \nPatterson stands where The Darkness was. The three Coolies are where they spent the night, on the other side of the bars. \nThis was the lowest point yet for Patterson. Not only had his notion come so close to working, he could never fully comprehend how the coolies missed. It never seemed possible- but of course, it really happened. \nPATTERSON Not once?- you didn't hit it once?- \nMIDDLE COOLIE -I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving- \nPATTERSON -well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing- \nMIDDLE COOLIE I assure you we came close many times- \nAbdullah is in the doorway near Patterson now- with several dozen men. And from Abdullah's face, this is clearly going to be a confrontation. \nMIDDLE COOLIE -the next time we will do better. (Patterson makes no reaction; moves outside) \nCUT TO \nABDULLAH, simmering, moving straight to Patterson as soon as he's out. \nABDULLAH The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo- \nPATTERSON (not in a mood for this) -that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it- \nABDULLAH (moving in- tension rising as others crowd behind him) -now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so- \nCUT TO \nTHE BUSH just beyond- something is moving- an animal?- Impossible to say. \nPATTERSON I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo- \nABDULLAH (cutting in) -at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo- \nPATTERSON -careful, Abdullah- \nPatterson and Abdullah and suddenly it's dangerous. \nABDULLAH You do not tell me \"careful\"- you do not tell me anything- you listen while I talk- (Now suddenly a shadow seems to cross-) \nCUT TO \nABDULLAH. CLOSE UP. His eyes widen. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nAN ENORMOUS PISTOL. Pressed hard against Abdullah's temple. \nMAN'S VOICE (over) -change in plan- you listen while I talk- because you have a question that needs answering. (beat) Will I pull the trigger? \nPULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL \nREDBEARD. \nWe are looking at one of those legends- ageless and powerful, with a tanned face and a thick grey beard. He has seen everything and is capable of anything. \nJust now he seems more than capable of killing Abdullah. Very calmly, he cocks the pistol. \nSAMUEL (over) It's Redbeard, Abdullah- he'll kill you. \nREDBEARD (not looking around) No hints, Samuel. \nABDULLAH (The name has registered) You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo. \nREDBEARD You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil. \nCUT TO \nABDULLAH, staring at Redbeard. Right now Redbeard just could be. \nABDULLAH (louder) I am a man of peace. \nREDBEARD Am I to take it you want to live? \nABDULLAH Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes. \nREDBEARD Excellent decision. (Now he suddenly reaches out, shakes Abdullah's hand) Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning. \nABDULLAH (dazed- leaving) I think it's been a pleasure. \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD, and now he does another surprising thing: embraces Samuel. \nREDBEARD (three words) You got old. (Now he releases Samuel, turns to Patterson) I'm sure you're John Patterson. (before Patterson can reply) Stay out of my way. (And without another word, he's gone) \nCUT TO \nTHE HOSPITAL \nas Redbeard moves through, taking it all in. It's even worse than when we last saw it- bodies crammed everywhere and always the sound of pain and sickness. \nPatterson stands in the doorway, watching, waiting. \nPATTERSON (as Redbeard approaches) I didn't have a chance to thank you. \nREDBEARD (preoccupied) What did I do? \nPATTERSON Got me out of trouble. \nREDBEARD (matter of fact) Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. (starts to move on) \nPATTERSON We need to talk. \nREDBEARD Let me save time- (1) you are the engineer; (2) you are in charge; (3) you're sorry I'm here. Right so far? (Patterson nods) Good- because (1) I am not an engineer, (2) I don't want to be in charge, and (3) I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems? \nPATTERSON Actually, no. \nREDBEARD All right- let's go into battle. (suddenly taking Patterson's hand) I'm Redbeard. (as they shake) \nPATTERSON Somehow I guessed. (As they move outside-) \nCUT TO \nTHE FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL \nREDBEARD VOICE (over) I'll need you by me in the morning. \nSAMUEL VOICE (over) Whatever you wish. \nCUT TO \nWHERE WE ARE- IT'S PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. Patterson, Redbeard, Hawthorne, and Samuel sit around a fire. \nTHey are cleaning their guns, getting ready. \nA WORD ABOUT THEIR WEAPONS. Patterson's is a good rifle and he cleans it expertly. \nRedbeard's surprisingly, is the oldest. And the way his hands move as he assembles it, he might be bathing a child. \nHawthorne is the least skilled of the three. But his rifle is clearly the finest. Bigger than the others, with great killing power. \nThere is a tremendous tension- Patterson, Hawthorne, and Samuel show it. Redbeard is as before. \nHAWTHORNE (terribly tense) You're certain about tomorrow? (Redbeard is) But you don't seem excited. (Redbeard isn't) \nPATTERSON You don't enjoy killing, do you? (Redbeard doesn't) \nHAWTHORNE Then why do it? \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD. CLOSE UP. He stares at the fire. Then- \nREDBEARD I have a gift. \nCUT TO \nTHE CAMPFIRE. Silence for a moment except for the sound of the weapons being reassembled. Redbeard's hands fly. His rifle is back together. He stands, nods, goes. \nCUT TO \nHAWTHORNE, watching him. \nHAWTHORNE Strange man. (to Samuel) Has he always been this way? \nSAMUEL Much gentler now. \nHAWTHORNE (shakes his head on that) John?- (He holds out his beautiful rifle) Change guns with me- mine's much more powerful. I'll be finishing the hospital tomorrow so I won't be with you- but if you'll use this... (beat) ...then I will. \nPatterson, touched, changes weapons. \nPATTERSON Thank you. (He turns to Samuel) Why does he need you by him? \nSAMUEL He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times... (beat) ...he knows I am afraid of lions... \nHOLD ON THE FIRELIGHT UNTIL WE SHARPLY- \nCUT TO \nTHE BRIDGE. BEFORE DAWN. \nMisty- hard to see much. \nThen GHOSTS appear- \nKEEP HOLDING \n-they're not ghosts, they're MASAI WARRIORS emerging from the mists. They are powerful and painted and they carry noisemaking equipment- tin cans and tom toms and as more and more of them materialize- \nCUT TO \nA HUGE THICKET. \nRedbeard, Patterson, and Samuel wait as the Warriors approach. \nREDBEARD (whispered) I spotted one of them- (gesturing toward the thicket) -in there. \nCUT TO \nTHE THICKET again- alive with thorn trees. Dark, filled with long dark shadows. \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. A lot of tension. \nREDBEARD The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers? \nPATTERSON (He hasn't) I can try. \nREDBEARD (no good) Samuel says you killed a lion. \nPATTERSON It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting. \nREDBEARD You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck. (points- hand out straight) Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. (He gestures for Patterson to take off and as he does-) \nCUT TO \nTHE WARRIORS as Redbeard goes to them- \nREDBEARD (as Samuel translates) -all of you- spread the width of the clearing- no gaps- go- (claps his hands once) \nCUT TO \nTHE WARRIORS, spreading apart. \nCUT TO \nTHE SUN. Starting to appear more strongly on the horizon. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, running like hell. \nCUT TO \nTHE WARRIORS, moving quickly, silently. \nCUT TO \nA THICK CLUSTER 0F THORN TREES. \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD- starting to suddenly get louder and point- \n-because something is there- \nCUT BACK TO \nTHE THICKET AHEAD, and we didn't see it before, only Redbeard saw it before- \n-but now something begins to move and \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and it's all going crazy now, and they're starting to move faster and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON IN THE SHADOW. \nThe noise has kicked up and all the time it's coming closer and \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and the movement up ahead is more distinct and the Warriors are almost in a frenzy as we \nCUT TO \nA FLASH OF THE GHOST IN THE THICKET- eyes bright- it starts to move away from the sound- \n-and toward where Patterson is waiting. \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD. Faster, screaming louder and \nCUT TO \nSAMUEL and the fear starting to leave and he screams louder too and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON- he fingers the weapon. \nCUT TO \nTHE GHOST, angrily retreating faster from the sound- and now instead of going straight back it begins to veer left and \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD, immediately spotting the shift, gesturingto the Warriors to get left and \nCUT TO \nTHE WARRIORS, shifting over as Redbeard directed, blocking The Ghost's intended path and \nCUT TO \nTHE GHOST, shifting, trying to go the other way this time and \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD; he spots that too, gestures for the Warriors to shift the other way and \nCUT TO \nTHE WARRIORS, racing to thier new positions, blocking the animal's path again and \nCUT TO \nTHE GHOST, rattled, upset, and now it starts retreating back in the original direction- toward Patterson and \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD AND THE WHOLE LONG LINE OF MEN, and it's as if mass hysteria has gripped them, because their sound keeps building and sure, their throats must ache and yes, their arms must tire, but you couldn't tell that from what they're doing- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. Waiting by the anthill. Waiting. Then, at last- \nCUT TO \nTHE GHOST, backing into view, staring back at the sound, unaware of Patterson's existence behind him. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. Noiselessly he steps away from the anthill into the sunlight. He raises Hawthorne's gun. \nCUT TO \nTHE GHOST, backing toward Patterson. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, sighting along the glistening barrel. \nCUT TO \nTHE GHOST, starting to turn. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, ready to fire. \nCUT TO \nTHE GHOST IN CLOSE UP, CAUGHT IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE RIFLE. And now its lips go back as it sees Patterson. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, CLOSE UP, and this is it, this is the moment and as he squeezes the trigger- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND THE GHOST, and a totally unexpected sound- a dull snap- Hawthorne's rifle has misfired. \nCUT TO \nA SECOND TENT, as it starts to collapse and \nCUT TO \nTHE MEDICINE TENT, as The Ghost and The Darkness enter and \nCUT TO \nMEDICINE, flying across the tent and \nCUT TO \nGLASS, shattering and more medicine is destroyed and \nCUT TO \nA BLIZZARD OF CUTS, of lions' claws and lions' teeth and those terrible bright blazing eyes and \nCUT TO \nA TENT POLE, being pulled out of the ground and \nCUT TO \nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS and what they are doing is this: destroying the New Hospital and \nCUT TO \nMORE TENTS collapsing and \nCUT TO \nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS. CLOSE UP. Eyes crazed. \nCUT TO \nHAWTHORNE ALONE IN THE NIGHT, scared shitless as he runs. \nCUT TO \nSHADOWS, moving, as Hawthorne's torch lights the surroundings and \nCUT TO \nHAWTHORNE, heart pounding, looking around and then he gasps as we \nCUT TO \nTHE AREA NEARBY- TWO LARGE EYES are staring at him. \nCUT TO \nHAWTHORNE, panicked, stumbling, falling, getting up, staring around- \nCUT TO \nTHE AREA AROUND HIM- the eys are gone- \n-and now there are loud shrieks in the night coming from the New Hospital and the instant they are heard \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON, grabbing torches, throwing the gate open and they're off as we \nCUT TO \nHAWTHORNE, running toward the New Hospital just up ahead now. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, tearing through the night. \nCUT TO \nTHE NEW HOSPITAL. (We see all this next through Hawthorne's eyes.) The tents are all down. The place is devastated. \nCUT TO \nINSIDE THE FIRST TENT. Filled with the dead and the dying. \nCUT TO \nHAWTHORNE. Ashen. Moving on. \nCUT TO \nPAN ALONG THE TENT \nDead. Blood. Pain. \nPAN TO THE SECOND TENT \nMore dead. \nMore dying. \nIt's a slaughterhouse. \nCUT TO \nHAWTHORNE. He's crushed. His body sags. He takes a breath, his last. \nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS are on him, roaring. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD as the roar reverberates- they glance at each other- \n-then they slow. \nBecause the New Hospital has come into view. \nCUT TO \nCUT TO \nA RAVINE. They are moving along the edge. It's tricky going- if you fell you wouldn't much like it. They are both concentrating on their movements, paying no attention to each other as Redbeard starts to speak. They don't stop moving. \nREDBEARD In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place. (beat) But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem. (beat) One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone. (beat) Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed. \nPATTERSON What happened to them? \nREDBEARD (pause) I got big. (They move on) \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD working their way up a steep ravine. It's hard going. They help each other. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving along the edge of the ravine now. Slow. Silent. Redbeard stops, points- \nCUT TO \nA TANGLE IN THE BUSHES AND THORNS with one odd thing about it: there is a clearly defined archway, as if a buffalo or rhino used it as a regular passage. \nCUT TO \nTHE TWO OF THEM at the archway. They look at each other, without a word move through it. \nCUT TO \nTHE OTHER SIDE. A small clearing. And at the end of the clearing: a cave. \nCUT TO \nTHE CAVE MOUTH. Dark. \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They each check their guns, move toward it. \nCUT TO \nTHE CAVE MOUTH. Closer. Suddenly it's getting eerie. \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD, moving slowly, Patterson right with him. \nCUT TO \nTHE CAVE MOUTH. They're by it- Redbeard squints inside. \nCUT TO \nWHAT HE SEES: it's dark and dangerous and there is a long low tunnel you have to half-crawl through. \nWithout a word, they start inside. \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON, crouched low, moving through the tunnel. Ahead there is light. They move on. \nCUT TO \nTHE END OF THE TUNNEL- they can see the cave beyond. \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They glance down. Nothing much there- just a copper bracelet, the kind a native might wear. \nNow they move past it and as the tunnel ends, they stand up. \nCUT TO \nINSIDE THE CAVE - IT'S BIG. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving deeper into the cave. It's scary- dark with shafts of light coming from cracks in the rock. It's dank. It all feels as at any moment, the world could end. \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Thunderstruck- \nREDBEARD Dear God- (And on those words-) \nCUT TO \nTHE FLOOR OF THE CAVE. More copper bracelets. And still more- \n-and now bones- \n-the floor of the place is littered with human bones- \n-eyeless skulls peer up at them from all around. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nThe rest of the cave. We are looking at a carpet of bones. \nPATTERSON Their den? (Redbeard nods) Have you ever seen anything like this? \nREDBEARD Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this- (beat) -they're doing it for pleasure. \nCUT TO \nSEVERAL TUNNELS, dark and ominous, leading from the cave- \n-and now there is a sound from one of the tunnels- \n-something is coming close and coming fast and \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON as Redbeard fires into the tunnel and the sound explodes- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON I'll be bait alone? \nREDBEARD Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever. (beat) Can you control your fear? \nPATTERSON I'll have to. \nREDBEARD I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me. \nPATTERSON Was that supposed to make me feel better? (Redbeard doesn't reply. Now-) \nCUT TO \nA DONKEY BEING LED IN. LATER. \nTHE MEN start to tie it down, across the clearing from the machan. \nPatterson takes a long look at the machan. He tests the support poles- they're rickety. \nCUT TO \nDUSK. The sun quickly beginning its quick fall. \nCUT TO \nTHE WATER TOWER IN THE STATION AREA. Samuel is with the remaining men who clamber up to the platform on top. \nCUT TO \nTHE DONKEY IN THE CLEARING. Quiet. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nRedbeard, holding a wooden ladder that is propped against the plank. Patterson climbs his slow way up. It's dangerous. \nCUT TO \nTHE PLANK as Patterson makes it, clambers off the ladder, manages to sit. \nCUT TO \nTHE VIEW. Nothing is around the machan. He is totally vulnerable. \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD, taking the ladder down. Patterson tries to get comfortable. He can't. \nREDBEARD (glancing around) It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you. \nPATTERSON You think they'll come then? (Redbeard does) Why? \nREDBEARD (not answering) Good luck. \nPATTERSON Why? \nREDBEARD (beat) Because I think they're after you. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. This registers. Finally, he nods. Redbeard starts to leave. \nPATTERSON How many do you think they've killed? \nREDBEARD (reluctantly) The most of any lions... a hundred...? (beat) Probably more. (Now Redbeard looks up at the younger man) Johnny...? \nThey study each other in the gathering darkness. They've been through a lot together, these two. They're not what they were when they first met. An emotional moment clearly is at hand. \nREDBEARD Don't fuck up. (And he turns, never looks back, just goes) \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. He is alone now. \nCUT TO \nSHADOWS. Growing longer. \nCUT TO \nSAMUEL. On top of the water tower. The remaining men are with him. \nCUT TO \nTHE DONKEY. It peers around. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. His fingers move slowly along his rifle barrel- \n-there is no noise- but you have the sense that, at any second, the world could explode. \nCUT TO \nTHE EDGE OF THE CLEARING, a good distance away. A bunch of trees. Nothing unusual. \nMOVE IN CLOSER: \nRedbeard, motionless, rifle in hand, is high in the branches. \nCUT TO \nTHE SUN. About to die. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, trying to get comfortable. It's not possible. \nCUT TO \nTHE DONKEY, tethered, but able to move. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, testing the machan- not a good idea- it trembles. He stops, stares out at the setting sun, the light hitting his skin, giving it color. \nCUT TO \nCUT TO \nTHE EYES OF THE GHOST. NARROWING. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. Involuntarily, a shiver. \nCUT TO \nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, but the angle shifts- \n-what's happening of course is this: The Ghost is circling around the platform in the safety of the bushes and the mist. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, following the whispered sound of the bushes moving. He half turns the other way quickly, making sure that nothing is behind him. \nCUT TO \nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON shifting as the angle continues to change. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON as the realization hits: the beast doesn't care about the donkey anymore, it's stalking him. \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD. In the tree. The mist obscures everything. \nCUT TO \nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Still circling, still closer. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, and it's scary now, this thing circling and circling, always closer, never visible and his throat is dry and you know he's just dying to blast it with his weapon or scream for it to do anything but this constantly circling movement. (In truth, the lion circled him for two hours, always coming closer, never quite seen.) \nCUT TO \nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, always the circling around. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, trying to turn on his shaky plank, trying to never to let the animal's position out of his sight. \nCUT TO \nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer... \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, staring, staring at the goddamn mist, about to come apart now with the tension as it builds and builds and builds and \nCUT TO \nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, gripping his weapon tightly as his head keeps on turning. \nCUT TO \nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, suddenly yelling out loud as an owl lands on him- that's right, a goddamn owl landed on him, thinking he was a tree, almost knocking him off the plank and \nCUT TO \nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, starting to slip off the platform and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, fighting the owl away, but his balance is going and he's trying not to fall and \nCUT TO \nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, beginning to topple off and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, helpless, balance going, going- \nCUT TO \nTHE GHOST, starting to charge forward and Christ he can move and as he starts his leap- \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD, racing from the tree to the edge of the clearing, firing his rifle, firing again and \nCUT TO \nTHE GHOST, as this incredible roar comes from him, and he spins, lands, and sure, he's been hit but he's gone, back into the bushes and the night has him and \nCUT TO \nSUDDEN DAWN AND PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, running, stopping, staring at the ground- \nCUT TO \nTHE GROUND. Blood. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving quickly forward again- \nCUT TO \nTHE GROUND. More blood and... \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came. (They toast each other) \nSamuel, with his own bottle of champagne has wandered over, joins them. \nSAMUEL (drunk) Where do you go next? \nREDBEARD Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You? \nSAMUEL Help finish the railroad. \nPATTERSON I want to meet my son- he must be what, two months old? \nThey look at the fire a moment. Then- \nSAMUEL Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once. \nPATTERSON I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it. \nREDBEARD Too soon to tell. \nThey look at him. \nREDBEARD My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell. \nSAMUEL (drinks) Some mysteries should not have solutions. \nREDBEARD (finishes his bottle, rises, looks at Patterson) Hold your son high. (And he turns, goes to his tent) \nPATTERSON (beat- quietly) He has children? \nSAMUEL (beat- quietly) Once... (HOLD on the two in the firelight. Then-) \nCUT TO \nTHE STATION MASTER AT TSAVO STATION, WORKING IN HIS OFFICE. THE NEXT DAY. \nFEMALE VOICE (over) I'd like to see John Patterson, please. (As he looks up-) \nCUT TO \nHELENA standing there in Tsavo; she looks weary from travel, but still lovely. She holds their son in her arms. The kid is adorable. \nHELENA Could you tell him that his wife- (catches herself, smiles) -that his family has come to see him. (On that-) \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AT THE BRIDGE- Samuel hurries to him with the news- Patterson takes off running and \nCUT TO \nTSAVO STATION and Helena; she holds the sleeping child, walks back and forth along the shaded front of the building, no sound at all but her heels. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, running like crazy and up ahead now is the station area. \nCUT TO \nHELENA- and now, in the distance, she sees him and she leaves the building, walks out into the open, smiling and waving excitedly and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, excitedly waving back and \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, moving out of the grassy area behind Helena and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, suddenly screaming \"Get back- back-\" \nCUT TO \nHELENA, and she's too far away- his words are lost on the wind- she smiles again, waves again and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, screaming now, all he has, \"GET BACK\" and \nCUT TO \nHELENA, and she still can't make out what he's saying but just the same, she stops and \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, stalking silently, closing on the mother and child. \nCUT TO \nHELENA, and the baby wakes, smiles and \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, starting to run and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON and now it shows on his face- he's not going to get there, he's never going to get there- \nCUT TO \nHELENA, and at last she knows something is terribly wrong and she turns- \n-but too late, too late as we \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, flying toward her now and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, in agony. \nCUT TO \nCUT TO \nA LARGE BABOON. ONE LEG IS TIED TO THE END OF THE BRIDGE. GETTING DARK NOW. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL, both armed, climbing the crane tower in use at the bridge, not far from the baboon. \nPATTERSON You're positive lions hate baboons? (Samuel is) Pebbles? (Samuel holds up a bag) Let's get it over with. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL as they reach the crane tower platform, fifteen feet from the baboon. \nThey help each other into position. Almost night. \nCUT TO \nTHE LARGE BABOON, baring its enormous teeth, shrieking out into the darkness. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL on the platform. Samuel tosses a pebble toward the baboon and the baboon cries out again, not in pain but irritation- \nCUT TO \nTHE PLATFORM. PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ARE FLOODED BY MOONLIGHT. IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. \nThey're both tired. Samuel throws another pebble. The baboon cries out. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, TENSE, ON THE PLATFORM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. \nHe's tossing pebbles now as Samuel dozes. Paterson looks wild; only nervous energy is keeping him going now. \nCUT TO \nTHE SKY. The moon. Peaceful- then it turns bright yellow and frightening black clouds gather and \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, blinking, coming hard back to reality because the sky is not yellow nor were there black clouds- he's starting to hallucinate. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL ON THE PLATFORM. \nSamuel is awake now. Patterson stares at the river which is calm. \nCUT TO \nTHE RIVER, raging and black and lethal. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, hallucinating again. \nCUT TO \nJUST BEFORE DAWN \nand The Darkness suddenly is there, creeping across the bridge toward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. Firing- \nCUT TO \n-THE DARKNESS, and it's hit and it roars and goes down and- \nCUT TO \n-PATTERSON, turning, reaching for Samuel's rifle, grabbing it, turning back, ready to fire again- \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS- gone. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL, blinking, looking around. \nPATTERSON Where is it? \nSAMUEL (pointing down) Underneath. (beat) Somewhere. \nCUT TO \nWHERE HE'S POINTING. The superstructure for the bridge- it goes several levels beneath the level where the railroad will run. \nThey look at each other- not good news and we find out why when we \nCUT TO \nEARLY MORNING LIGHT. \nPatterson and Samuel climb carefully down from their platform to the railroad level. They reach the railroad level. PAtterson releases the baboon which races away. \nCUT TO \nWHERE THEY ARE. At the end of the bridge where they began construction. The bridge, two thirds finished, stretches away before them. \nCUT TO \nThey begin to walk the incomplete bridge... carefully... \n..as they go the look down through the crevices of their level, making sure they miss nothing. \nCUT TO \nSAMUEL. Terrified.

(Now from that-) \nCUT TO \nFLAMES RISING IN THE DARKENING SKY. NOW- \nCUT TO \nABDULLAH in tears. Where are we? \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nThis is Singh's funeral pyre. \nSingh's body is being burned. \nA LOT OF INDIANS are there. We've caught sight of some of them before- they worked with Singh on the embankment or lived with him in his tent. \nThere is a terrible sense of shock. \nPatterson stands at the rear. He is terribly moved. Now, unseen by the others, he holds his hands out in Singh's gesture one final time. \nCUT TO \nTHE FLAMES; they continue to rise... \nCUT TO \nSINGH'S TENT \nNight. The flaps that were open when Singh was alive are now shut and tied. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, the middle of the night. He is alone, fifteen feet up in a tree near Singh's tent. He holds his rifle, ready for anything. He cannot get comfortable. \nCUT TO \nTHE AREA- nothing, no movement. \nCUT TO \nSINGH'S TENT. As before. \nCUT TO \nTHE AREA. No sign of movement of any kind. Dead. \nCUT TO \nTHE MOON. Lower in the sky. The night is growing to a lose but there is still darkness. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. Battling fatigue- but now, for a moment, losing- his eyes, against his will, start to close, and as they do- \nCUT TO \nTWO HUGE YELLOW EYES. That's all we see, just the eyes and they are near Patterson's tree and they are staring up at him and- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, startled, grabbing his rifle more tightly, staring down and- \nCUT TO \nTHE HUGE YELLOW EYES- only they're gone. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, blowing on his hands, looking toward the sky. \nCUT TO \nTHE SUN, RISING, THE NIGHT DONE. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, wrinkled and weary, frustrated and sore, walking back toward his tent area. Now he stops. \nCUT TO \nABDULLAH and a large group of workers- only they're not working. They smoke, play cards, sit around. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, steaming, going up to Abdullah. \nPATTERSON You were contracted to work- \nABDULLAH (gesturing around) -malaria epidemic; very sudden. \nPATTERSON Let me see the sick. \n", "test1_true": "PATTERSON There is no reason for fear. \nABDULLAH On that I choose to remain dubious.

Where?- \nSTARLING (gesturing) -far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now. (beat) There's even less of him than of Singh. \nPATTERSON (just shakes his head) But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon. (getting control- he looks to Samuel) Samuel? \nSAMUEL We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night. \nPATTERSON Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night. (to Abdullah) Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two. (Abdullah nods) And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge. \nABDULLAH Of course you will, you are white, you can do anything... (They look at each other. They are not friends. Now-) \nCUT TO \nTHE THORN BUSHES WE SAW ON OUR ARRIVAL TO TSAVO \nENDLESS NUMBERS OF THEM.

They do it with care- these are claws- \nCUT TO \n-STARLING, in charge of another area, and he's not hanging back, he's taking less care than the others, hacking away with his machete, moving in between bushes and \nCUT TO \nONE OF THE BUSHES, SNAPPING BACK into Starling, and Starling taking the blow with his arms- the claws cut his clothing- \n-his arms are starting to bleed- \n-he is unmindful, continues to wade into the bushes, chopping at them, cutting them down. He is a good man doing a good thing and right now, he is possessed. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, leaving his tent area, lost in thought, going toward the bridge. Up ahead is a grassy area. \nCUT TO \nTHE GRASSY AREA \nFor a moment, nothing. Then there is the same kind of movement we saw with Singh. Something is making the grass move- \n-only now there is no wind... HOLD. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. Did he see it? We'll never know. \nCUT TO \nSTARLING, in charge of a thorn fence that is halfway finished. His clothes are shredded. A WORKER has finished with a section and satisfied, moves on- \n-but Starling is far from finished. He grabs the thorns with his bare hands and squeezes them together. \nSTARLING Not good enough- look, it's got to be tighter. Tighter. \nCUT TO \nTHE AREA IN WHICH HE'S BEEN WORKING. FENCES ARE WELL ALONG TOWARD COMPLETION. IT'S LATE AFTERNOON. \nPULL UP \nWe see more fences around more camp areas. \nKEEP PULLING UP \nThe entire place is filled with fences now, all the individual areas protected. \nThe skies are starting to darken- dusk is coming fast. \nFires start up. Dozens of them. \nStill darker. \nNow workers come racing home to their camps, anxious for safety before darkness takes over. They zig-zag this way, that way, dodging past each other sometimes they slam into each other, fall, get up, run on- \nCUT TO \nTHE SUN. Falling out of the sky. \nCUT TO \nTHE CAMP. The fires rise higher. No one moves... HOLD. \nCUT TO \nSTARLING in the main tent area. He is bathing his bloody hands. Samuel is with him. Both are exhausted. \nPatterson brings them each drinks. They nod thanks, drain them. They stand there together, lit by the flames of their fire. You get the sense these three will be friends forever. \nSTARLING What a good week. \nPATTERSON You mean nobody died? \nSTARLING (shakes his head) We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor. (beat) My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands. (looks at them) I like the blood, is that strange? \nSAMUEL Oh yes, I think so. (Starling smiles, starts to speak) \nPATTERSON Look out, Samuel, here it comes. \nSTARLING Even you two must admit that it is a glorious thing, what Man can accomplish. When there is a common splendid goal, there are no limits. Think what we will accomplish when we all have God's warmth in our hearts. (Samuel's eyes have closed; he begins to snore.

He stalks the perimeter now too, on the far side from Redbeard- and suddenly a different and frightening sound- the ripping of flesh- \nCAMERA MOVES UP \nNow we can see both Patterson inside and also outside where, in shadow, The Ghost and The Darkness are devouring a hunk of meat. \nRedbeard moves quickly across the perimeter, gestures for Patterson to switch positions with him. \nAs he reaches where Patterson was, the eating sound stops. \nSilence again. \nPatterson reaches the far side of the fence. \nNow the eating sound comes again, and again, BOTH LIONS are outside, directly across from Patterson. \nCUT TO \nREDBEARD looks across the perimeter at Patterson.

Your idea? (Patterson nods) Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once. \nPATTERSON But of course yours worked. \nREDBEARD In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound. \nHe goes back to walking the perimeter.

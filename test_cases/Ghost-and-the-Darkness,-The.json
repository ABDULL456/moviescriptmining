{"test1_input": "STARLING (laughs) I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here? \nPATTERSON (looks at his watch) Almost three hours. (beat) But I've been getting ready all my life. (Now, from them-) \nCUT TO \nA BUNCH OF IMPOVERISHED-LOOKING NATIVE WOMEN. They hold children who wave at the passing train. The children are more impoverished looking than their mothers. \nSTARLING (suddenly touched) Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls. \nPATTERSON Beaumont says it's to end slavery. \nSTARLING (shrugs) We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes- (interrupts himself) -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me. \nPATTERSON (They really like each other) Have you got that in writing? (Starling, amazingly good natured, laughs. And now-) \nCUT TO \nA WHITE CLAW. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nHundreds of white claws. \nKEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL \nThey aren't claws at all, they're thorns as sharp as claws and they're on a twenty-foot high thorn tree. \nAnd there are dozens of those trees, packed together. All mixed in with other trees, low and stunted, and thick underbrush and baked red rocks- \n-now the train begins to slow. \nSmoke drifts across. \nA bunch of wildebeest scatter off the tracks. \nSTARLING (over) Welcome to Tsavo. (on the word) \nCUT TO \nTSAVO. \nWe have arrived at the train station area and what we see is a place that is still being built. There are tin shacks; a water tower is under construction- \n-men are working everywhere, for that's what Tsavo is: a place for work. \nTHE TRAIN goes slower still. \nNo one stands idly around here. \nBut no one looks happy either. \nONE MAN is apart from the rest: this is SAMUEL. \nAn ageless Masai, tall and slender, he has a smile that can light the world. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND STARLING as they step off the train. \nSTARLING (indicating Samuel, who is approaching) Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts. \nPATTERSON (softly) Does he speak English? \nSAMUEL (not softly enough) And very poor French. \nSTARLING (introducing) Samuel- John Patterson. \nSAMUEL (as they shake) The bridgebuilder- (gesturing to the working men) -we have been getting ready for you. \nPATTERSON Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? (Samuel nods) \nSTARLING I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. (starting off) \nSAMUEL I will bring him, Nigel. \nWe should realize by now that Samuel's was the voice we heard at the very beginning of the picture. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL, starting to walk. They pass the water tower. \nStanding on top of it in a precarious position is an extremely powerful INDIAN. He waves to Samuel who waves back. This is SINGH. \nWORKERS study Patterson as he moves by. Not smiling. Up ahead, some SIKHS are erecting tents. Not smiling. \nPATTERSON Why do the workers look unhappy? \nSAMUEL Because they are here. (beat) Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world. (He points ahead) Come, John- to the bridge. (And on that-) \nCUT TO \nTHE RAILROAD TRACKS as the camera pans along. \nCUT TO \nTHE RIVER in the distance as they walk toward it. \nAnd here is as good a place as any to explain just what the spot where the movie takes place was like. \nThere were five hundred men working for Patterson. And they lived in a spread out area. A bunch of Indian coolies who might have come from the same town back in their country might choose to live in one cluster of tents. A group of natives might be in another cluster. \nWhat we have then, as far as living places are concerned, are dozens of clusters of tents. (Eventually, as the terror began, these areas all got surrounded, each with its own thorn fence.) \nThe places we'll come to know best are, among others, Patterson's living area, the hospital tent area, the area by the river where the bridge is to be built, etc., etc. \nAs they move, Samuel points out various camps. \nA SECT OF INDIANS is getting ready for prayer. \nANOTHER SECT OF INDIANS is eating. \nA GROUP OF AFRICANS are cleaning their tent area. \nAnyway, you get the idea. Just remember that the place covered a wide expanse, maybe a mile square, maybe more. \n", "test1_true": "PATTERSON (as they pass the INDIAN tent area where prayer is starting) It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job. \nSAMUEL Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly. \nPATTERSON The workers don't get on? \nSAMUEL Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. (As they move on) \nCUT TO \nRAILROAD TRACK. \nPAN ALONG TO \nMORE RAILROAD TRACK. \nKEEP PANNING \nAnd suddenly the track just stops in mid-air as we \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL standing high above the Tsavo River. The track has come to the edge of the area above the riverbank- where it just stops- \n-and picks up on the far side. All that's missing, in other words, is the hundred-yard-long bridge that will connect the pieces of track. \nSAMUEL (to the far side) Railhead is across there. \nCUT TO \nTHE DISTANCE. Nothing can be made out clearly but there are great clouds of dust. \nSAMUEL Three thousand men laying track- when the bridge is done, it all joins up. \nPatterson nods, says nothing, but goes to his haunches, staring at the space where the bridge is to be. \nSAMUEL Did it look like this in your mind? \nPATTERSON (shakes his head) This is more difficult- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Excited. \nPATTERSON (eyes bright) -but how wonderful that it's difficult, it should be difficult- what better job in all the world than build a bridge?- make things connect- bring worlds together- and get it right! (Now from Patterson-) \nCUT TO \nTHE HOSPITAL TENT \nas Patterson and Samuel walk in. Patterson glances around- \n-it's not bad at all. Of course there are some patients, injured or with fever. But like the rest of the camp we've just seen, everything is working well, everything is under control. Starling approaches. \nSTARLING Finish your tour? \nPATTERSON (nods) And anxious to get started. (indicating the hospital) What is this, mostly malaria? \nSTARLING Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain. \nMAN'S VOICE (over) That's just vomitous talk, Nigel- the poor bastards will relapse if you keep on that way. (As they turn-) \nCUT TO \nDOCTOR DAVID HAWTHORNE. A tough, middle-aged cockney. And a heavy drinker. A man who hasn't been tactful in twenty years. \nHAWTHORNE (to Patterson) I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, \"don't get sick in front of it.\" (beat) That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack. \nSTARLING You never had it. \nHAWTHORNE Nigel and I don't like each other much. \nSAMUEL (breaking the tension) I am also liaison between these two. \nPATTERSON (to Hawthorne) Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad? \nHAWTHORNE This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer. \nPATTERSON Then why do you stay? \nHAWTHORNE Who else would hire me? (to Starling) Beat you to it, didn't I? (beat) Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. (Now he gestures and we-) \nCUT TO \nA NERVOUS ORDERLY who approaches them. He has been freshly bandaged across one shoulder. \nHAWTHORNE This is Karim, one of my orderlies- attacked by a man-eater earlier today- first incident of that kind here. \nPatterson says not a word, just studies the wounded man. \nSTARLING (incredulous) A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it? \nHAWTHORNE Well, he got away, didn't he? (to Patterson) Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. Listening. No emotion on his face. \nCUT TO \nHAWTHORNE. He's kind of enjoying this. Bearing down. \nHAWTHORNE I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey- (beat) -but what are you going to do about it? \nPATTERSON (a long pause, then evenly-) Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey. (beat) With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. (And he walks out, leaving an astonished Starling staring after him) \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON'S TENT AREA \nStarling has a tent there, too, as do Samuel and Hawthorne. And there are half a dozen ORDERLIES. \nRight now, Patterson is unpacking, moving in and out of his tent. Starling, sipping tea, sits and watches. \nSTARLING I couldn't believe it when you said \"sort it out.\" As if it were the most normal thing in the world. \"Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway.\" \n", "test1_id": 3129, "test2_input": "CUT TO \nTHE VULTURES screeching and screaming, taking off, and as we watch them soar into the morning sky- \nHAWTHORNE'S VOICE (over) What the lion must have done, once he'd killed Singh, was lick his skin off so he could drink his blood- \nCUT TO \nTHE HOSPITAL \nHawthorne is examining Singh's body, trying to be professional, but he's clearly upset- it's awful. \nHAWTHORNE -then he feasted on him, starting with his feet- \nSTARLING (evenb more upset) -please- you needn't be so graphic- \nHAWTHORNE You intend \"sorting this out\" tonight? \nPATTERSON I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size. \nSTARLING (maybe a little alarmed) But you said they were always old. \nPATTERSON That's what the books say... (Now from that-) \nCUT TO \nFLAMES RISING IN THE DARKENING SKY. NOW- \nCUT TO \nABDULLAH in tears. Where are we? \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nThis is Singh's funeral pyre. \nSingh's body is being burned. \nA LOT OF INDIANS are there. We've caught sight of some of them before- they worked with Singh on the embankment or lived with him in his tent. \nThere is a terrible sense of shock. \nPatterson stands at the rear. He is terribly moved. Now, unseen by the others, he holds his hands out in Singh's gesture one final time. \nCUT TO \nTHE FLAMES; they continue to rise... \nCUT TO \nSINGH'S TENT \nNight. The flaps that were open when Singh was alive are now shut and tied. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, the middle of the night. He is alone, fifteen feet up in a tree near Singh's tent. He holds his rifle, ready for anything. He cannot get comfortable. \nCUT TO \nTHE AREA- nothing, no movement. \nCUT TO \nSINGH'S TENT. As before. \nCUT TO \nTHE AREA. No sign of movement of any kind. Dead. \nCUT TO \nTHE MOON. Lower in the sky. The night is growing to a lose but there is still darkness. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. Battling fatigue- but now, for a moment, losing- his eyes, against his will, start to close, and as they do- \nCUT TO \nTWO HUGE YELLOW EYES. That's all we see, just the eyes and they are near Patterson's tree and they are staring up at him and- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, startled, grabbing his rifle more tightly, staring down and- \nCUT TO \nTHE HUGE YELLOW EYES- only they're gone. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, blowing on his hands, looking toward the sky. \nCUT TO \nTHE SUN, RISING, THE NIGHT DONE. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, wrinkled and weary, frustrated and sore, walking back toward his tent area. Now he stops. \nCUT TO \nABDULLAH and a large group of workers- only they're not working. They smoke, play cards, sit around. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, steaming, going up to Abdullah. \nPATTERSON You were contracted to work- \nABDULLAH (gesturing around) -malaria epidemic; very sudden. \nPATTERSON Let me see the sick. \n", "test2_true": "PATTERSON There is no reason for fear. \nABDULLAH On that I choose to remain dubious. (beat) Two are dead now in two nights. (And on that news-) \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. Rocked. He didn't know. Behind him now, Starling hurries up, Samuel alongside. \nPATTERSON (to Starling) Second death? Where?- \nSTARLING (gesturing) -far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now. (beat) There's even less of him than of Singh. \nPATTERSON (just shakes his head) But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon. (getting control- he looks to Samuel) Samuel? \nSAMUEL We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night. \nPATTERSON Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night. (to Abdullah) Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two. (Abdullah nods) And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge. \nABDULLAH Of course you will, you are white, you can do anything... (They look at each other. They are not friends. Now-) \nCUT TO \nTHE THORN BUSHES WE SAW ON OUR ARRIVAL TO TSAVO \nENDLESS NUMBERS OF THEM. There is a machete-like sound as we \nCUT TO \nA BUNCH OF WORKMEN, led by Samuel, chopping down branches. They do it with care- these are claws- \nCUT TO \n-STARLING, in charge of another area, and he's not hanging back, he's taking less care than the others, hacking away with his machete, moving in between bushes and \nCUT TO \nONE OF THE BUSHES, SNAPPING BACK into Starling, and Starling taking the blow with his arms- the claws cut his clothing- \n-his arms are starting to bleed- \n-he is unmindful, continues to wade into the bushes, chopping at them, cutting them down. He is a good man doing a good thing and right now, he is possessed. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, leaving his tent area, lost in thought, going toward the bridge. Up ahead is a grassy area. \nCUT TO \nTHE GRASSY AREA \nFor a moment, nothing. Then there is the same kind of movement we saw with Singh. Something is making the grass move- \n-only now there is no wind... HOLD. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON. Did he see it? We'll never know. \nCUT TO \nSTARLING, in charge of a thorn fence that is halfway finished. His clothes are shredded. A WORKER has finished with a section and satisfied, moves on- \n-but Starling is far from finished. He grabs the thorns with his bare hands and squeezes them together. \nSTARLING Not good enough- look, it's got to be tighter. Tighter. \nCUT TO \nTHE AREA IN WHICH HE'S BEEN WORKING. FENCES ARE WELL ALONG TOWARD COMPLETION. IT'S LATE AFTERNOON. \nPULL UP \nWe see more fences around more camp areas. \nKEEP PULLING UP \nThe entire place is filled with fences now, all the individual areas protected. \nThe skies are starting to darken- dusk is coming fast. \nFires start up. Dozens of them. \nStill darker. \nNow workers come racing home to their camps, anxious for safety before darkness takes over. They zig-zag this way, that way, dodging past each other sometimes they slam into each other, fall, get up, run on- \nCUT TO \nTHE SUN. Falling out of the sky. \nCUT TO \nTHE CAMP. The fires rise higher. No one moves... HOLD. \nCUT TO \nSTARLING in the main tent area. He is bathing his bloody hands. Samuel is with him. Both are exhausted. \nPatterson brings them each drinks. They nod thanks, drain them. They stand there together, lit by the flames of their fire. You get the sense these three will be friends forever. \nSTARLING What a good week. \nPATTERSON You mean nobody died? \nSTARLING (shakes his head) We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor. (beat) My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands. (looks at them) I like the blood, is that strange? \nSAMUEL Oh yes, I think so. (Starling smiles, starts to speak) \nPATTERSON Look out, Samuel, here it comes. \nSTARLING Even you two must admit that it is a glorious thing, what Man can accomplish. When there is a common splendid goal, there are no limits. Think what we will accomplish when we all have God's warmth in our hearts. (Samuel's eyes have closed; he begins to snore. Patterson can't help laughing) \nCUT TO \nSTARLING. As good natured as ever. \n", "test2_id": 3130, "test3_input": "THE BRIDGE AGAIN AS NIGHT FALLS - MORE CROWDED THAN BEFORE. \nSTILL MORE MEN are moving into the river. They wade til the water is up to their necks. Then they reach out, hold hands, start to sing. \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON moving high into a tree. He listens to the sound. Lovely. \nCUT TO \nMOONLIGHT ON THE WATER. The men stand as before, singing softly. The river here is calm, no current to speak of. The men are safe- \n-or rather they should be. \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS swimming softly, his great jaws silently encircling the neck of the last man in line, pulling him silently away and as the others start to scream- \nCUT TO \nPATTERSON, watching another flare rise, helplessly listening. \nCUT TO \nA CATTLE PEN.

DAY. PACKED. \nHAWTHORNE seems overwhelmed. \nCUT TO \nSOMETHING. \nAnd for a moment we don't know what it is.

In the other, the three armed, tough coolies. \nFor a moment, it could be a frozen tableau- both sides are too startled and surprised to do anything but stare- \n-and then all hell just explodes as we \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, and this incredible roar comes from his throat, the kind of roar that can be heard five miles away in the night but this one in the enclosed room sounds even louder and more terrifying and \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, throwing his huge body at the bars and \nCUT TO \nTHE BARS and both his front claws are slashing through and \nCUT TO \nTHE THREE TOUGH COOLIES and they retreat against the rear wall of the car. \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, rage building, throwing its body at the bars again and \nCUT TO \nTHE COOLIES, pressed in fear against the far wall, unable to do anything but stare and \nCUT TO \nTHE CLAWS, ripping at the air and \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, leaping forward, smashing into the bars and \nCUT TO \nTHE CEILING WHERE THE BARS are connected and the sheer power of his leap has made them jiggle just the least bit and \nCUT TO \nTHE COOLIES, staring up at the ceiling and \nCUT TO \n", "test3_true": "CUT TO \nTHE CEILING- and the bars shake- \n-but they're not giving way. \nCUT TO \nTHE TOUGH COOLIES, as they begin to realize this and \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, clawing for them and \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, raging and roaring on his side of the bars and \nCUT TO \nTHE FIRST COOLIE, raising his gun and \nCUT TO \nTHE SECOND COOLIE, his gun raised too and \nCUT TO \nTHE THIRD COOLIE and he's ready and \nCUT TO \nALL THREE AS THEY FIRE- \n-and reload- \n-and fire again, and reload, and- \nCUT TO \nTHE RAILROAD CAR- and suddenly the lamp is knocked over- \n-and a fire starts, flames grow and it's starting to look like hell in there- \n-only it gets worse as we- \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS at the bars- \n-and suddenly it stands up- it seems to fill the car, towering over everything, it's like a nightmare come to kill you- \nCUT TO \nTHE COOLIES staring up at this giant thing, and of course they're more terrified now than they've ever been in their lives- but these are tough men and they ignore the flames, ignore the deafening roars of the beast and \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, standing there, going crazy on his side of the bars, trying to knock them down but they're holding and \nCUT TO \nTHE TOUGH COOLIES, reloading and \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, racing around the enclosed area now and he's trapped and the flames make him seem like something unalive and his eyes have never been so bright, his roars as deafening and \nCUT TO \nTHE THREE COOLIES, firing again and \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, leaping at the bars again, and they shake, sure they shake, but they keep on holding and \nCUT TO \nTHE COOLIES, firing, reloading, firing, reloading and as they do, something's starting to come clear- \n-amazing as it may seem, impossible as it may be to conceive, they're missing. \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, whirling on his side, roaring and leaping and \nCUT TO \nTHE COOLIES and sure they fire, but they're still so goddam scared and \nCUT TO \nTHE DOOR THAT SLID DOWN- it's held in place by some thick wooden bars- \n-and now the Coolies start to hit something- the wooden bars because they begin to splinter and \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS, whirling, leaping at the bars and \nCUT TO \nTHE COOLIES firing and then- \nCUT TO \nTHE DOOR as it flops open and just like that- \nCUT TO \nTHE DARKNESS.

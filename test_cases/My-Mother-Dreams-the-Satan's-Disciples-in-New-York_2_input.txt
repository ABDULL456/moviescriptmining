HIGH DOWN WIDE of Marian standing forlornly at the end of the street, a Dayton's shopping bag in one hand, her luggage strapped to the tote in the other.

Marian pulling her luggage apprehensively down the street. 
She passes THE SQUATTERS, a motley group of homeless teenagers, pierced, tattooed, wild hairdos and even wilder attire. 
SQUATTER #1 Hey, lady, can you help us out with some change today? 
Marian, shocked by their circumstances, rolls her luggage past them, smiling faintly. 
SQUATTER #2 Come on.  Every little bit helps.  A little food, you know? 
MARIAN Maybe some other time.

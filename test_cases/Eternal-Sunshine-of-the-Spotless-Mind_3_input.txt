Mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught.  She is silent for a long moment. 
MARY No. (beat) Besides, Howard's married, Stan.  He's a very serious and ethical man.  I'm not going to tempt him to betray all he believes in. 
Stan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to Mary. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Patrick, bundled up and carrying a full backpack, trudges through the snow. 
INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Clementine watches out the window as Patrick nears.  She's crying.  He makes his way up her front stairs.  She swings open the door and hugs him. 
PATRICK Oh, baby, what's going on? 
CLEMENTINE I don't know.  I'm lost.  I'm scared.  I feel like I'm disappearing.  I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me. 
PATRICK Oh, Tangerine. 
CLEMENTINE Nothing makes any sense.  Nothing makes any sense. 
She pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at Patrick. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Come up to Boston with me? 
PATRICK Sure.  We'll go next weekend and -- 
CLEMENTINE Now.  Now!  I have to go now.  I have to see the frozen Charles!  Now!  Tonight! 
PATRICK Um, okay.  I'll call my study partner. 
CLEMENTINE Yay!  It'll be great!  I'll get my shit. 
She runs into the bedroom.  Patrick is at the phone and realizes he doesn't know Joel's number.  After a moment's thought, he *69's.  The phone rings. 
JOEL'S VOICE Hi, it's Joel.  Please leave a message after the beep. 
Beep. 
PATRICK (whisper) Stan, it's Patrick.  Pick up. 
STAN'S VOICE Hey, where are you? 
PATRICK I got into a situation with the old lady. Can you handle things tonight alone?  I'm really sorry, man. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Stan is on the phone.  He's really stoned and watches Mary, stoned herself, dancing in a sexy trance to something soft and low on the stereo. 
STAN I can handle it.  He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway. 
INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
PATRICK Thanks, Stan.  I owe you. 
Patrick hangs up, rifles quickly through his backpack.  He pulls out a silver bracelet, puts it in his pocket, then pulls out a journal, flips through it, keeping an eye on the bedroom door.  The handwriting is a woman's.  He finds what he's looking for.  He reads: 
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE I took Joel to walk on Charles River with me last night.  It was so beautiful and charming.  Joel was nervous about stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to please me so much -- he's so sweet -- that he came out after me.    We lay down right in the center and watched the stars.  He took my hand and said "I could... 
EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT 
Joel and Clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen river.  They look up at the stars. 
JOEL ...die right now, Clem.  I'm just... happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm just exactly where I want to be. 
Clementine looks over at him.  Her eyes are filled with love and tears.  Then they get vague.  The scene is being erased. Joel is panicked. 
JOEL (CONT'D) Clem, no!  This can't keep happening. Please!  Oh, fuck!  Please! 
Crazily, Joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed scenes: He and Clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled cheese and tomato soup together in bed, Joel watching her sleep, them drinking at a bar.  He arrives at a decayed version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak. 
MIERZWIAK We can help you through this.  Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about -- 
JOEL You have to stop this! 
MIERZWIAK What?  What do you mean? 
JOEL I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased!  Stop it now! 
MIERZWIAK Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining.  What can I do?  I'm in your head, too. 
INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Patrick reads the journal. 
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE ... and we made love right on the ice. It was absolutely freezing on my ass!  It was wonderful.

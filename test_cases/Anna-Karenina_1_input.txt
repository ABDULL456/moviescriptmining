INT. OBLONSKY'S DRESSING ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE--DAY 
Oblonsky has been bunking down on his couch. He moans and groans. He gets up and tries the door to the bedroom. It's locked. He knocks timidly. 
OBLONSKY (PITEOUSLY) Dolly . . . please think of the children . . . 
He listens hopefully. The other door, leading to the upper landing, is opened violently by Dolly. 
DOLLY You think of the children! Their lives are ruined now! 
She slams the door behind her. 
INT. BEDROOM LEVEL, OBLONSKY HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY 
Oblonsky comes out of his dressing room to see the main bedroom door slammed. He attempts to go in but the door is locked. 
OBLONSKY Oh, Dolly . . . I beg you . . . 
Matvey come to the top of the stairs with a telegram. 
MATVEY Telegram. Should I send up the barber? 
OBLONSKY No, just the razor. 
Oblonsky tears open the telegram. 
MATVEY Don't worry, sir, things will shape them- selves, you'll see. 
OBLONSKY (RELIEVED) My sister Anna's coming tomorrow. We're saved. 
INT. OBLONSKY'S OFFICE, MOSCOW--DAY 
Inner doors open and Oblonsky comes out of his private office. He is his genial self. Everyone in the general office-- minor officials, clerks-- stands up for him and bows. Oblonsky is wearing government uniform--green coat with gold embroidery on the collar--instead of his own coat. Oblonsky is helped out of one coat into the other. 
DOORKEEPER Some man came without an appointment, Your Excellency . . . waiting outside. 
Oblonsky opens the door to look. Levin is sitting waiting on a bench, wear- ing a sheepskin coat, cap and scuffed boots. 
OBLONSKY Levin! Where did you disappear? 
He seizes Levin and kisses him. 
LEVIN (NERVOUS) I'm very anxious to see you. I need your advice. 
OBLONSKY Well, then, come into my room. 
Oblonsky leads Levin back through the general office, where everyone stands up again. Levin's sheepskin and boots attract curious glances. 
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) This is my oldest friend, Konstantin Dmit- rich Levin! Someone send word I'll be a few minutes late. 
INT. OBLONSKY'S PRIVATE OFFICE, SAME TIME--DAY 
Oblonsky leads Levin inside and closes the door. 
OBLONSKY I've been hard at it. Sit down. 
Levin undoes his coat and sits down. 
LEVIN Hard at what exactly? 
OBLONSKY Why, we're overwhelmed with work! 
LEVIN Oh--paperwork. 
OBLONSKY Paperwork is the soul of Russia. Farming is only the stomach. When am I going to come and shoot some snipe? 
Seeing the clothes Levin is wearing, he laughs. 
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Oh, but look at you, in Western clothes you told me you'd never wear again. Some- thing's up. 
LEVIN Yes. I'm in love. I've come back to propose. Have you guessed who she is? 
OBLONSKY (rolls his eyes comically) I have a suspicion. Why didn't you propose when you were here? 
LEVIN I decided it was impossible. Kitty is of the heavens, an angel, and I am of the earth-- but then I thought and thought, and . . . there's no life for me without her! . . . Do I have a chance? 
OBLONSKY Of course you do. The Shcherbatskys are giving a soiree this evening. Get there early before the crowd. If I may suggest . . . 
LEVIN Anything! What? 
OBLONSKY New boots. 
LEVIN Right. Anything else? 
OBLONSKY (HESITATES) We'd better have dinner together. 
Come on, we'll meet later at l'Angleterre. Or do you prefer the Hermitage? 
Oblonsky ushers Levin back into the general office. 
INT. GENERAL OFFICE, SAME TIME--DAY 
. . . Everyone stands up as before. The Doorkeeper produces Oblonsky's top- coat and helps him into it. 
OBLONSKY No--five-thirty at l'Angleterre--I owe them more than the Hermitage, so it wouldn't be fair to withdraw my custom. (taking his hat) Boots, and a coat. And a proper hat. 
He ushers Levin out. 
EXT. L'ANGLETERRE RESTAURANT, MOSCOW--DAY 
Firstly, a Moscow street scene, busy with people going about their business, on foot and in conveyances.

Air flows through the space, swirling dust along the floor. A banner hanging from the ceiling ripples from the breeze. 
SCENE 33 INCORPORATED INTO SCENE 34 
INT. MUSEUM/ALINE'S OFFICE - AT THAT MOMENT Aline sits at her desk, her back to the shelving units. She inspects the stone tablet and takes notes. 
In one of the shelving units, a faint glow emanates out of a closed drawers. 
Something in another drawer begins glowing. Then the contents of a third drawer start to glow. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Out of the three drawers, a LOW HUM is emitted. Aline looks up, tilting her head to hear the LOW HUMMING. 
She turns around to face the shelving units. She is surprised to see the strange glow coming out of the three drawers. 
She cautiously approaches the shelving units. She reaches a hand out to open the first glowing drawer. 
SCENE 35 OMITTED 
EXT. SHIP DECK - AT THAT MOMENT As the First Mate and Crewman Barnes watch in anticipation, Captain Chernick opens the gold container all the way. 
The container is empty. 
The lights along the Deck start to flicker. 
INT. SHIP STORAGE ROOM The lights in the Storage Room start to flicker on and off. Hudgens looks up at the lights. 
HUDGENS They're faster than I thought... 
SCENE 38 OMITTED 
INT. SHIP DECK he lights continue to flicker. Captain Chernick turns to the Storage Room door. He looks back at the First Mate and Crewman Barnes. 
CAPTAIN CHERNICK Kill him. 
The First Mate and Crewman Barnes pull out revolvers. They approach the Storage Room door. 
There's a WHOOSH of movement behind them. The three men all turn, surprised. But nothing is there. 
Suddenly, Captain Chernick is thrown back by something invisible. He is hoisted into the air. He looks shocked. 
Captain Chernick seems to be floating just above the ground, although it is clear something invisible is holding him up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The First Mate and Crewman Barnes look on, stunned, their revolvers aimed at the floating Captain. 
Captain Chernick's body contorts, as if something had been thrust into it. With a burst of blood, a hole is ripped into his torso, killing him. 
Captain Chernick's lifeless body is dropped to the ground. 
Terrified, the First Mate and Crewman Barnes aim their 4    revolvers at the empty air. They OPEN FIRE. 
INT. SHIP STORAGE ROOM Hudgens stands at the door, listening to the GUNFIRE. 
He looks through the peephole in the door. The peephole is dirty, hard to see through. Something frantic is happening outside the door, but it's hard to see exactly what. 
There is more GUNFIRE and then SCREAMING. Short BURSTS of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE follow, and more SCREAMING. 
And then, all is quiet. 
Hudgens grabs a discarded metal rod and jams it into the door handle, wedging it closed. He backs away from the door. The only weapon he can see is a box-cutter. He grabs it, holding it out in front of him. 
Suddenly, there's a CRASH at the door. Something pushes at the door, trying to get in. The door RATTLES and THUMPS from the impact. 
Hudgens, still holding the box-cutter, strains against the door, using all the effort he can muster to keep it shut. The metal rod wedged against the door is starting to buckle. 
Suddenly, the door is still. Hudgens waits. Nothing. 
There's a CRASH as another impact hits the door. The RACKET is even more intense. But the door holds. 
Finally, the thrashing stops. All is quiet again. 
The lights in the Storage Room stop flickering. They come back on. Hudgens listens, straining to hear anything at all. 
Cautious, Hudgens pulls away the metal rod. He gingerly touches the door. With a long CREAK, it slowly swings open. The crowbar was shaken loose from all the impacts.

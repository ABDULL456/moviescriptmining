Carrie looks up at the stage ­ at the massive thrones all in white. 
CARRIE They're beautiful. 
TOMMY You're beautiful. 
Carrie meets his eyes and blushes; it's all overwhelming her, and she has to look away ­ at the tiny party favor boat on the table in front of her, at the tiny pencil next to it. 
CARRIE Who do we vote for? They're more your crowd than mine. 
TOMMY Whatever you like. 
CARRIE In fact, I don't really have a crowd. 
TOMMY Let's vote for ourselves. To the devil with false modesty. 
She laughs aloud ­ the sound of her own laughter is so foreign to her that she claps a hand over her mouth, at her own daring. She takes the pencil and quickly circles their names ­ so quickly that the pencil breaks, bringing a small drop of blood to her finger. She gasps. 
TOMMY Hurt yourself? 
CARRIE No. (trying to smile) But I broke it and it was a souvenir. 
TOMMY There's still your boat. (he pushes it gently toward her) Toot, toot. 
196 INT. SCHOOL ­ NIGHT 
as Sue ­ hardly in formal attire ­ stares through the same small window in the gym door that Carrie stared through earlier ­ she stares inside as: 
197 INT. GYM ­ STAGE AREA 
The ballots are being counted, Morton and Fish helping Ernest separate them into piles. We ought to notice either De Lois or Trennant hanging around the voting tables ­ perhaps Norma Watson as well. 
198 ANGLE ­ TOMMY AND CARRIE'S TABLE 
Carrie is holding Tommy's hand tightly ­ too tightly. 
TOMMY Hey, hey. 
CARRIE 
Sorry. 
TOMMY Don't know your own strength. Whew. 
He sees she's taking him seriously. Sensitive to her reaction, he smiles at her. 
TOMMY Hey, it's okay. 
In the background Josie and the Moonglows provide a flourish of drums. 
199 THE STAGE 
as Ernest walks up to the microphone and almost drops the ballots in the process. 
ERNEST We've sort of hit a snag. Mr. Morton says this is the first time in the history of the Spring Prom that ­ 
VOICE How far does he go back? 1800? 
LAUGHTER, CATCALLS. 
ERNEST We've got a tie. 
GEORGE Polka-dot or striped? 
ERNEST Sixty-three votes for Frank Grier and Cora Wilson, and sixty-three votes for Tommy Ross and Carrie White. 
Silence, then the APPLAUSE begins and starts to swell as we... 
CUT TO: 
200 TOMMY's POV ­ CARRIE 
An island in the APPLAUSE around her, her head lowered... 
201 TOMMY 
Watching her intently, his mouth slightly open... 
202 THE STAGE ­ ERNEST 
Vainly trying to speak over the APPLAUSE. 
ERNEST Attention! If I could have your attention, please... 
203 TOMMY AND CARRIE 
Tommy still staring at her. 
ERNEST (o.s.) We're going to have a run-off ballot. When you get yours, please write the couple you favor on it. 
204 CARRIE 
Slowly looking up, seeing Tommy. 
CARRIE They're not applauding for us. It can't be for us. 
TOMMY Maybe it's for you.

HAMMAKER Corporal Carl Edward Hammaker, Marine Barracks, Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Charlie. 
ROSS Corporal, were you present at a meeting that Lt. Kendrick held on the afternoon of August 6th with the members of second platoon. 
HAMMAKER Yes sir. 
ROSS Would you tell the Court the substance of that meeting? 
HAMMAKER Lt. Kendrick told us that we had an informer in our group.  That Private Santiago had gone outside the chain of command and reported to the NIS on a member of our platoon. 
ROSS Did that make you mad? (pause) You can tell the truth, corporal, it's alright. Did it make you mad? 
HAMMAKER Yes sir. 
ROSS How mad? 
HAMMAKER Private Santiago betrayed a code that we believe in very deeply, sir. 
ROSS Were the other members of the squad angry? 
KAFFEE Object -- 
ROSS Were Dawson and Downey? 
KAFFEE Please the Court, is the judge advocate honestly asking this witness to testify as to how the defendant felt on August 6th? 
RANDOLPH Sustained. 
ROSS Corporal, did Lt. Kendrick leave a standing order at that meeting? 
RANDOLPH Yes sir. 
ROSS What was it? 
HAMMAKER Well it was clear that he didn't want us to take matters into our own hands, sir. 
ROSS What was the order? 
HAMMAKER Sir, he said that Santiago wasn't to be touched. 
ROSS (to KAFFEE) Your witness. 
KAFFEE Corporal Hammaker, were you in Dawson and Downey's barracks room ten minutes after this meeting? 
HAMMAKER No sir. 
KAFFEE Thanks, I have no more questions. 
HAMMAKER gets off the stand, and KAFFEE watches while walks past DAWSON and DOWNEY. A barely perceptible exchange occurs between the eyes of DAWSON and HAMMAKER. 
KAFFEE makes a decision. 
ROSS The Government calls Corporal Raymond Thomas -- 
KAFFEE Please the Court, I understand Lt. Ross is planning on calling all the other members of Rifle Security Company Windward to testify. 
ROSS In light of the defense that Lt. Kaffee is planning to mount, the explicit instructions of the platoon leader seems particularly relevant testimony. 
KAFFEE The defense is willing to concede that all 23 witnesses will testify substantially as Corporal Hammaker did, if the Government is willing to concede that none of them were in Dawson and Downey's room at 16:20 on August 6th. 
RANDOLPH (to ROSS) Lieutenant? 
ROSS The Government'll agree to the stipulation, sir. 
RANDOLPH Then we'll adjourn for the day. You can call your next witness in the morning.

CUT TO: 
INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY 
COMMANDER STONE, a Navy doctor in his mid-40's, is on the stand. 
STONE ...And he was pronounced dead at zero-zero-thirty-seven. 
ROSS Dr. Stone, what's lactic acidosis? 
STONE If the muscles and other cells of the body burn sugar instead of oxygen, lactic acid is produced. That lactic acid is what caused Santiago's lungs to bleed. 
ROSS How long does it take for the muscles and other cells to begin burning oxygen instead of sugar? 
STONE Twenty to thirty minutes. 
ROSS And what caused Santiago's muscles and other cells to start burning sugar? 
STONE An ingested poison of some kind. 
KAFFEE Your Honor, we object at this point. The witness is speculating. 
ROSS Commander Stone is an expert medical witness, in this courtroom his opinion isn't considered speculation. 
KAFFEE Commander Stone is an internist, not a criminologist, and the medical facts here are ultimately inconclusive. 
RANDOLPH A point which I'm confident you'll illustrate to the jury under cross- examination, so I'm sure you won't mind if his opinion is admitted now. 
KAFFEE Not at all, sir. Objection withdrawn.

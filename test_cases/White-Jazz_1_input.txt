GLENDA BLEDSOE Or desperation. Depends on the day. 
The laughter ebbs, her eyes still shine. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT'D) I'll get there though. (beat) I'll get there. 
I let the silence take...try not to shatter it with: 
ME Dwight Gillette. 
She doesn't blanch. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE He asked me to take his `niece and nephew' to their cousin in Oxnard. These beautiful, funny little kids. (tears she doesn't swipe) I dropped them off. Didn't ask any questions -- I believed Dwight. A week later I saw their pictures in the Post Office. A week after that their little bodies came in on the tide near San Pedro. (beat, tears stream) I'll never shake the thought that maybe those poor kids thought I was part of it. That I knew what was going to happen to them. So I pray to God that he let them look in when I put that knife into Dwight. (beat) But I'll never ask his forgiveness for doing it... (beat, clears her eyes) Why do they call you `Enforcer?' 
She actually gets closer, I can feel her breath on me. 
ME I've killed 44 men. 
She blanches, but never blinks...never takes her eyes away from mine. 
ME (CONT'D) 33 for War. 2 for principle. 9 for profit -- mostly. Why did you sign with Hughes, knowing what he was? 
GLENDA BLEDSOE `For profit -- mostly.' 
Silence. A feeling like: `and there we are...' 
ME I'm not much good. 
GLENDA BLEDSOE Me neither. 
She touches my quake. Two breaths with her hand on mine and it all goes quiet: the shakes, the images, the fear. She takes my head, pulls me to her bare breasts. The only things audible: my breathing, a clock ticking. Both slowly fade out. 
BLACK. 
Wake up quiet, look at my Hamilton. 6 AM. Sit up slow. 
Look back at her, sleeping, just stare. I lean down, kiss her lightly, her taste lingers, inhale her, hold that...it's the last good thing you'll get today. 
88   INT. MEG'S HOUSE - EARLY A.M.                                88 
Dark. Stay quiet. Maneuver into the kitchen. Turn on a light. On the table: safe open, it's contents laid-out neatly, short- stacks of files, $1000 in twenties. I sit, start searching for something else...Pete's voice behind me: 
PETE (O.C.) The Knife ain't there. File on top of that middle pile: George Ainge in an `undisclosed locale.' 
I don't turn. Pete sits next to me. Sets a shotgun down. 
PETE Junior documented everything like a fucking Monk. (pulls a file) Like here: `has evidence' you murdered Sanderline Johnson. (MORE) 
PETE (cont'd) Kept track of `suspected contract killings' you pulled for the mob. 
Look at Pete. Dark rings, deathbed eyes. 
ME You been up all night? 
PETE In-case Stemmons made a house-call. He's got every goddamn address of everybody you know... (beat, hard) And you should've told me about the Bledsoe broad. 
ME There's nothing to tell. 
Feature Pete, righteously pissed: 
PETE Then call Milteer about this dead Pimp Gillette. I'm no legal mind like you, but I'll bet a murder beef would violate her morals clause quick. (beat, hands phone) Collect the rest of your money. 
ME I don't want it anymore. 
PETE Then give that five grand back. 
ME Junior stole it. 
Pete pauses, scoffs, turns back toward Meg's bedroom walks: 
PETE People are gonna start lining-up to see you bleed, Pal. 
Door closes. I flip through Junior's files: the same architect-neat block printing. Find a Glenda entry: 
SUBSEQUENT TO HER FATAL STABBING OF DWIGHT Gillette, MISS BLEDSOE SECRETED THE MURDER WEAPON WITH GEORGE AINGE. I HAVE ACQUIRED THIS KNIFE. IT IS A SIX-INCH BLADE WITH A MOTHER-OF-PEARL GRIP WHICH SUSTAINED RIGHT THUMB AND RIGHT INDEX PRINTS WHICH MATCH ELEVEN COMPARISON POINTS TO FINGERPRINTS ON FILE FROM MISS BLEDSOE'S 1946 JUVENILE SHOPLIFTING ARREST. 
Shred it. Grab another file. Hyper-detailed: subscript clarifications, attachments, pictures, procedural notes to the U.S.A.W.N.: United States Attorney Welles Noonan. 
Then I see the tab of the file furthest down: BOYCE BRADLEY. Open it: Noonan's business card stapled to the front cover. Flip forward. Scan. See Bradley's name, finger tracks across a page. A company name: `HURWITZ HOLDINGS' 
I read it all...and feel my jaw slowly unhinge...

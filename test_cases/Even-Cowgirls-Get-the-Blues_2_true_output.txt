THE BARE-ASSED COWGIRLS storm into the beauty parlor and exercise rooms. 
SOUNDS OF breaking glass and wood splintering. The air is singing with cries of "Wahoo," Yippee," "Let 'er buck" and "The vagina is a self-cleaning organ." 
INT. KITCHEN 
SISSY flees the house as she hunkers down out the back door. 
EXT. CROQUET COURT 
Sissy running across it. She passes the pool, and falls in. Climbing out, wet, scared, she runs to the base of Siwash Ridge and southward along the mountain's foot. 
EVENTUALLY Sissy comes to a place where the juniper bushes are broken to reveal a crude path beginning a steep ascent. Sissy decides to climb up it. 
She shoulders her way through low, slivery boughs. 
Approximately halfway up the ridge she rests on a flat rock from which she can look down on the... 
BURNING RUBBER ROSE smoking away, distant yahoos and carryings on can be heard. Horses whinney in the corral. A few gunshots are thrown into the soundtrack if things aren't lively enough. 
MISS ADRIAN'S CADILLAC, ON FIRE, roars out of the drive. 
Sissy looks up to the quiet mountain. Pauses. Then she looks back to the chaos below. 
THE CINEMATOGRAPHERS' RENTED CONVERTIBLE AND THEIR EQUIPMENT VAN drive away. 
Sissy sits and wonders. The sun is setting on the horizon, mixing well with the firelight that the Rubber Rose is giving off. 
BUT SHE is aware of something watching her. Looking about she sees nothing. 
VIEW of an empty trail. 
VIEW OF a quivering bush. 
Sissy turns to the sound of the CHINK. 
CHINK Ha ha ho ho hee hee. 
AND THERE HE IS. Standing only ten yards away. 
The Chink's problem is that he looks like he rolled out of a Zen scroll, as if he says "presto" a lot, knows the meaning of lightning and the origin of dreams. He LOOKS as if he drinks dew and fucks snakes. 
Sissy and the Chink scrutinize one another with mutual fascination. 
CHINK Ha ha ho ho and hee hee. 
Sissy is just about to speak, but before she does THE CHINK whirls, and scampers up the mountainside.

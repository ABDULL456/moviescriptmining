WEAVER (taking Azteca's hand) Right...because every ant's important! 
WORKER #2 (scoffs) But that would mean I'm important. 
WORKER #1 I'm outta here, this sounds like trouble to me. 
But more ants are gathering 'round. 
WEAVER We can all be individuals!  Just like Z! 
Weaver and Azteca hold hands.  More ants are gathering around, dropping their tools... 
EXT. BIKE PATH - DAY 
LONG SHOT.  A glimmering desert landscape (think of "The Sun's Anvil" in Lawrence of Arabia).  Two small figures can be seen, tiny dots moving across the arid whiteness. 
They're Bala and Z, who are crossing a concrete path in the park, which they perceive to be a "desert". 
BALA Water...water... 
Z Water...water -- oh, you already said that. 
BALA (walking along) My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life. 
Z I ruined your life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was happily miserable. 
Over Z's line, we can see a GIGANTIC WHEEL, getting larger and larger and heading right towards them, a GIGANTIC WHEEL (the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards them). 
BALA Look out! 
Bala pushes Z out of the way just as the wheel rolls past with a cacophonous CRUNCHING, GRINDING noise -- like a gigantic millwheel. 
BALA We're going to die! 
Z Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again? 
No sooner has he said it than the rear wheel of the bike thunders past. 
Z Well I'll be. 
Bala notices that they're clutching one another in fear; she pushes him away. 
BALA Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's wrong with me? 
Z Want a list? 
BALA (urgent) Wait, I hear something! 
We can, in fact, hear a low, musical PLUNK.. there's a pause and then we can hear it again... 
Z and Bala walk over a rocky "dune" (the soft shoulder of the path).  Beyond, the grass starts up again.  They have come to the end of the "desert" (i.e. the other side of the path) Through the blades of grass, we can see... 
Z It's...it's... 
BALA WATER!!! 
EXT. LAKE - DAY

13    INT. COFFEE BAR. DAY                                       13 
Jenny and two school friends, HATTIE and TINA, are sitting at a table in a typical late-50s coffee bar, sipping cappuccinos. Jenny is easily the most attractive of the three - and also, we will see, possibly the cleverest. HATTIE is slower than the other two, and a lot frumpier; TINA is pretty, and sharp rather than clever. She is also the least middle-class of the three - she's clearly a scholarship girl. They are all dressed in an unflattering and unambiguous school uniform - no attempts to disguise it with more fashionable accessories. Jenny is smoking pretentiously, and seems to be practising some kind of pout. Tina starts to slurp the froth from her cappuccino with a spoon, inelegantly and noisily. Jenny tuts her disapproval. Tina sighs, and puts her spoon down. 
JENNY The whole point about him is that he doesn't feel. 
TINA We still don't have to like him. 
JENNY Camus doesn't want you to like him. What he's trying to say is that feeling is bourgeois. Being engagee is bourgeois. His mother dies and he doesn't feel anything. He kills this Arab and he doesn't feel anything. 
TINA I wouldn't feel anything if my mother died. Does that make me an existentialist? 
JENNY No. That just makes you a cow. 
HATTIE Une vache. 
Laughter. 
14   EXT. STREET/COFFEE BAR. DAY                                   14 
Jenny, Hattie and Tina emerge from the cafe, talking. 
JENNY Well I'm going to be French. I'm going to Paris and I'm going to smoke and listen to Jacques Brel and wear black. And I won't speak. Ever. C'est plus chic, comme... 
She breaks off. Parked outside a tobacconists on the other side of the road is the red Bristol. She looks towards the shop, and David emerges with a copy of the Times and a packet of cigars. Jenny crosses the road to talk to him while the others watch. 
DAVID Hello. 
JENNY Hello. Thank you. 
DAVID How did it go? 
JENNY Oh, fine. I think. I mean, I didn't mess my bit up, anyway. And no-one got thrown out of the orchestra afterwards. 
DAVID Always the mark of a cultural triumph. Listen. I'm glad I ran into you. What are you doing on Friday? 
JENNY Going to school. 
DAVID I meant the evening. 
JENNY (embarrassed) Oh. Yes. Of course. Nothing. 
DAVID Because I'm going to listen to some Schubert in St John's, Smith Square. My friends Danny and Helen will be going too, so it wouldn't be...I'll tell you what. I'll come and pick you up, and if your mother and father disapprove, then you can have the tickets and go with one of them. How does that sound? 
Jenny doesn't know what to say. She looks at David, and his eagerness to please seems to convince her. 
JENNY Thank you. And I'd like you to take me. I'd like to go with someone who knows when to clap. 
DAVID I usually watch Danny. He knows that sort of thing. 
Jenny smiles. 
DAVID Seven? And we'll probably go for a spot of supper afterwards, if you...But if you, if that's not...Well, we can always put you in a taxi. 
JENNY (flat disbelief) Supper. 
DAVID If you want. 
JENNY The trouble is, we'll already have eaten. 
DAVID Well. I mean, if you'd like supper, then, perhaps on Friday you could...not eat? 
JENNY (embarrassed again) Oh. Yes. Of course. 
Jenny smiles, and rejoins her friends on the other side of the road. Tina and Hattie are standing there almost with their mouths open, amazed. She doesn't say anything and starts to walk on. 
TINA I'm sorry. I just had the strangest dream. I dreamed you crossed the road and spoke to a handsome man with the most beautiful car I've ever seen. And then you came back and you didn't mention it. 
Jenny smiles enigmatically. Tina grabs Jenny mock-urgently. 
TINA `Oo wazzee? 
JENNY (light, playful) Just a man who's been trying to pick me up. We're going to a concert on Friday night. And then we're having a spot of supper. 
TINA (shrieking) A spot of supper? 
JENNY You've heard of supper? 
HATTIE We've heard of it. But we've never eaten it. 
JENNY Neither of you is interested in the concert part, I notice.

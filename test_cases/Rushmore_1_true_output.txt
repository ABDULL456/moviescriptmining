He's really making a go of it over at Grover Cleveland. 
MISS CROSS 
I think he's on track. It's nice, isn't it? 
Mr. Blume nods. Silence. 
MISS CROSS 
You want a carrot? 
MR. BLUME 
Yeah. I'll have one of those. 
Mr. Blume takes one of the carrots and has a bite of it. Miss Cross watches him chewing. She smiles slightly. 
MR. BLUME 
Well. Max had said something about us all going to the horseraces, so I'm sure I'll see you soon. 
Miss Cross nods. Mr. Blume takes another bite of his carrot and throws the rest of it into the yard. Miss Cross laughs. Mr. Blume smiles and shrugs. He starts to go. 
MISS CROSS 
Or we could go for a walk, if you want. 
Mr. Blume stops and turns around quickly. 
MR. BLUME 
Sure. 
MISS CROSS 
It's nice out, don't you think? 
Kind of brisk. 
Mr. Blume nods. 
MISS CROSS 
Let me get a sweater. I'll be right back. 
She goes inside. Mr. Blume stands alone on the doorstep. He rubs his hands together to warm-up. 
INT. MUSEUM. DAY 
A class of Rushmore FOURTH GRADERS file past a big painting of a ship caught in a storm and disappear into the next room. One of them immediately comes back and looks around the corner. It is Dirk. He has seen something: 
Miss Cross and Mr. Blume are sitting on a bench in front of a Rembrandt. They are holding hands. 
Dirk narrows his eyes. 
EXT. RUSHMORE. DAY 
Mr. Blume is parked at the curb, staring off into space. Ronny and Donny jump into the car and slam the doors. 
RONNY 
Let's go. 
Mr. Blume automatically puts the car in gear. He slams on the brakes. Dirk is standing in front of the car, blocking them. He stares at Mr. Blume. Mr. Blume rolls down his window. 
MR. BLUME 
Dirk? 
Dirk does not budge. Mr. Blume gets out of the car and leaves it idling. He closes the door. 
MR. BLUME 
Dirk? What's wrong? 
DIRK 
I know about you and the teacher. 
Silence. Mr. Blume looks very worried. 
MR. BLUME 
Does Max know? 
DIRK 
No. And I don't want him to know. I just want it to stop. Right now. 
They stare at each other. 
DIRK 
You're a married man, Blume. And you're supposed to be his friend. 
MR. BLUME 
Look, Dirk. I am his friend - 
DIRK 
Yeah. And with friends like you, who needs friends? 
Dirk turns and walks off. Mr. Blume looks puzzled. 
MR. BLUME 
Jesus Christ. 
Mr. Blume sighs. He turns around and tries to open the car door. Ronny and Donny have locked him out of the car. He can see them inside laughing. He says fiercely: 
MR. BLUME 
Unlock it! 
CUT TO: 
Dirk walking across the lawn with a hard look on his face. He walks past Magnus Buchan. Magnus is throwing Chinese throwing stars at a tree trunk. 
MAGNUS 
Little Calloway 
Dirk stops and looks to Magnus. 
MAGNUS 
You're standing up for the wrong bloke. Fischer ain't your mate. 
DIRK 
(angry) 
What are you talking about, Buchan? 
MAGNUS 
(shrugs) 
He thinks your mum's good for a bonk. That's why he picked you as his chapel partner. 
Dirk looks deeply wounded. But he doesn't want to believe it:

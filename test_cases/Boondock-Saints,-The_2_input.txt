CHECKOV You insult me. I would never drink that sewage. Especially with you people. You are fools. 
Checkov slaps the beer to the floor. 
CHECKOV This is no game! If you won't go, we will make you go! 
The boys look at each other, remembering what Mom said. 
They still hold the shots. 
CONNOR If ya want a fight, you can see you're outnumbered. We're trying ta be civil here, so I suggest you take our offer. 
CHECKOV I make the offers, ass-hole. 
Rocco pushes off the bar. He's had enough. 
ROCCO (standing between the two brothers) Hey, there Boris. What would you say if I told you that your pinko, commie mother sucked so much dick... 
Wham! Ivan punches him in the face. He is quickly down and out. Connor and Murphy's faces turn to stone as they speak the next few lines in flawless fluent Russian with English subtitles. 
CONNOR "Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?" 
MURPHY "I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan." 
Checkov is completely taken aback. All the Irish are fairly impressed as well. 
CONNOR I don't think Ma would mind. 
They clink the glasses together, throw back the Hennessey, ball up the thick glasses in their fists, drop to one knee and both deliver a devastating blow to each of Checkov's quads. Murphy on the left, Connor on the right. He's down for the count, writhing on the floor. 
The boy's each take a Russian guy and start fighting as the others start kicking and spitting on Checkov. This is a bar brawl, lots of punches don't connect. Connor dismantles his man quickly. Murphy is still fighting as all the Irish try to jump in and help Murphy but Connor goes into psycho mode, pushing them all back. 
CONNOR Let the boy go. He knows what the fuck he's doing! 
They all back off and start to cheer him on. Murphy and Vladdy are ripping each other apart. Vladdy backs him against a wall and pulls back, exhausted, for one good punch. Murphy reaches up behind his head with both hands and pulls two bottles of wine from a wall rack. He swings them toward each other with Vladdy's head as the mid-point. The bottles haphazardly connect, one on each side of his head. He crumples to the ground in an explosion of glass and wine. 
There is shock and silence. 
CONNOR Nicely done, boy! 
INT. MCGINTY'S PUB  NIGHT  A FEW MINUTES LATER 
They have Ivan Checkov tied down to the bar on his stomach. 
Connor stands with an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips next to Ivan. He pours Hennessey all over Checkov's buttocks. 
They all cheer. Ivan's face is battered as Rocco wakes and approaches. He punches Checkov in the face in complete rage. 
Two friends subdue him as all chuckle. 
CONNOR Now, like my fine brother says, on St. Patty's everyone's Irish. And this piece of shit is about to be initiated. 
As they cheer, Connor lights up his smoke and tosses the match on Ivan's butt. 
The Hennessey is instantly ablaze and Checkov is screaming and wiggling in horror. Some just stand there stunned, but most of the remaining onlookers leap to Ivan's aid. They furiously pat him out and turn on Connor. 
FRIEND #1 Are ya tryin' ta kill him, ya fuck? 
INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY NEXT MORNING 
Connor and Murphy, fairly beat up, sit up on their beds. 
They wear tattered bathrobes and boxer shorts. They put their feet down into their leather boots. The boys examine the extent of one another's injuries and reflect on their hangovers. They both laugh and grab their heads in pain. 
Boom! The door breaks open and in hobbles Checkov and Vladdy, guns drawn. Checkov is all beat up and the ass of his pants is burnt out. A bulky bandage covers his buttocks. Vladdy has a large bandage around his head. The boys stand in surprise. 
Ivan smashes Connor in the forehead with his gun, sending blood gushing down his face as he falls to the floor. Murphy helplessly yells his brother's name as he is brought to his knees by Vladdy. Ivan positions Connor on his knees before the toilet, which is open to the room. Checkov puts his foot on Connor's head and proceeds, as he struggles, to hand cuff him to the old toilet. So now Connor is bleeding and hugging the commode with his hands cuffed behind the bowl base. 
CHECKOV (almost whispering) I was going to kill you. But I'm not... I'm going to kill your brother. I'm going to take him down to the dumpster and I'm going to shoot him in the head. Then I'm going to throw his dead body in the garbage. (looks at this watch) Trash guys are coming in 10 minutes, gotta go. 
Checkov walks towards the door and says "let's go" to Vladdy. 
MURPHY It was just a bar fight. You guys are fuckin' pussies!

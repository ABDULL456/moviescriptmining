She leans over, grabs the gun and sticks it in her purse. She finds her chub card inside. She sighs. 
EXT. DELLA'S HOUSE - EVENING 
She remembers her shoulder hurts when she climbs out of the car. That her arm hurts when she pushes the car door closed behind her. That her heart hurts when she sees the star of the tree still lying there in the snow. 
The whole side of the car is scratched to hell and the windshield is shattered. She makes her way down the path to the front door. She kicks off her wrecked muddy boots on the front step. Turns the adjoining key, on the car key chain, in the front door lock. Pushes open the door. 
INT.   DELLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING 
KENNETH Where the hell have you been? 
Scene 132Page 95 
Kenneth's voice meets her as she steps into the house. Nice welcome. 
She doesn't respond. Closes the door behind her. Walks into the house. 
There he is ahead, leaning against the office door. Beer in one hand, remote in the other. The TV blaring behind him. 
KENNETH (CONT'D) I said.... 
He's about to begin shouting again when he notices something's not right about her. 
KENNETH (CONT'D) Della? 
He switches the TV volume down using the remote. 
KENNETH (CONT'D) Della honey are you all right? 
She stares back at him coldly. 
DELLA Please don't call me that. Don't ever call me that again. 
KENNETH What? 
She steps slowly towards him. Sees a violent adventure flick wrapping up behind him on TV. The end credits scroll down the screen. 
DELLA I just wanted to get home to my babies. 
Kenneth cannot understand her garbled words. He sees the dried blood on her chin, matted mud on her coat. 
KENNETH What happened to you? 
She just stares. 
KENNETH (CONT'D) Was there an accident? 
Scene 132Page 96 
She keeps staring, looks at him with a cold odd expression. She needs to be held like a child but he doesn't even move towards her. Just stands there like a jerk, unsure of what to do, so he takes a swig of beer. 
KENNETH (CONT'D) Are you hurt? 
That swig of beer turns what was left of her love for him to stone. 
A beat. 
DELLA Are they okay? 
Without waiting for an answer. 
INT. STAIRWAY - EVENING 
She turns and races up the stairs. 
INT. THE TWINS BEDROOM - EVENING 
She opens the door softly. The night light casts a pale glow out low across the carpet. There they are, all tucked up in their quilts, breathing gently, little faces flushed with sleep. 
She sighs, closes her eyes with relief, softly closes the door behind her. 
INT. STAIRWAY - EVENING 
Walks back downstairs. 
INT. KITCHEN - EVENING 
Kenneth is pacing about the kitchen, opening another beer. 
KENNETH Sound asleep, huh?

MORRIS Oh, Lord... 
(68) INT. CLUB (1ST AVE. ST. BAR.) -- DAY 
CU--Clock.  We SEE 11:25 
Prince cuts through the back entrance, walks onto the floor.  Lisa and Wendy are onstage PLAYING a SONG we immediately recognize as the one they had given Prince to listen to.  The DRUM RIFF is provided by the Linn Machine (a synthesized drum unit).  Wendy plays guitar, her back to Prince.  Lisa, at the keyboards, spots him and stops-- 
WENDY What's wrong? 
Lisa points to Prince.  Wendy immediately rips into the guitar solo of "G-Spot."  She stops suddenly-- 
WENDY Is that better? Do you like that? 
He ignores her-- 
PRINCE Where is everybody? 
LISA You're late -- they left. 
PRINCE So what are you doing here? 
Lisa immediately launches into the opening bars of "Let's Get Crazy"-- 
LISA (imitating Prince) But I'm here to tell you that there's something else -- our music--. 
The Girls bust up -- he glares at them-- 
PRINCE Can't you guys get off it? Can't you just leave it alone? 
Wendy meets his glare with one of her own... 
WENDY Yeah -- we'll get off it. 
She turns, snaps off the Linn Machine angrily, plunging the club into silence. 
(69) INT. REHEARSAL HALL --DAY 
The Time is JAMMING like MAD, deep in the heart of "Sex Shooter."  Brenda and Susan move furiously to the beat, trying their best to get it right.  They are watched by ... 
...Morris, Vanity  and Jerome standing off to the side.  Morris has a contented look on his face, even though his girls are screwing up.  Vanity's eyes are wide with excitement 
MORRIS As you can see, we need someone with your special qualities. 
(70) INT. PRINCE'S ANTECHAMBER AND BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
CU--Clock.  We See: 8:15. 
Prince sits, on his bed, staring at the clock, seemingly lost in thoucht.  He gets up, rummages through his coat pockets, pulls out Lisa's and Wendy's tape.  He snaps it into the player, settles back. 
MUSIC fills the room.  He listens intently a moment, his face placid.  He closes his eyes, tries to relax ... 
Suddenly a DOOR SLAMS in the far reaches of the house.  Harsh FOOTSTEPS echo through the upstairs hallway.  Prince remains still, his eyes closed... 
Then another deathly DOOR SLAM!  GLASS dissolves in its frame and trickles to the floor like icicles.  Resentment surges in him like a tornado.  He rises purposefully, turns the MUSIC up... 
...And then his door SMASHES open and his Mother LUNGES into the room in a PANIC.  She flings herself onto his bed as his Father streaks in and WHACKS! WHACKS!  WHACKS!  at her with a strap, SCREAMING at her with an ominous growl of rage-- 
FATHER You ain't got no business leaving here!  All your sneaking around -- you're just a sinner!  You're nothing but a low life sinner! 
The Mother throws herself at him drunkenly, starts slapping, scratching at his face-- 
MOTHER Shut up!  You don't care about me!  Leave me alone! 
Prince claws desperately at his Father's back-- 
FATHER Don't I keep the heat on? Isn't there food in the refrigerator? 
MOTHER (crying) I don't like it here.  You never talk to me! I'm always alone! 
Prince drags his Father away--

ALEX The basket was very lovely. 
JULIE Tammy wrapped all of them. 
Tammy waves. 
JULIE (CONT'D) Ryan, you look so grown up. 
RYAN Me? You're the one getting married. 
JULIE I know, right? You haven't even seen my ring. 
Julie shows off her ring. It's not quite balanced and seems to favor quantity over quality. 
JULIE (CONT'D) (PROUDLY) Jim designed it. 
JIM raises a hand. This is Julie's husband-to-be and we can tell immediately that Ryan isn't thrilled. 
Ryan thinks of something. He pulls out the 5X7 PHOTOS they took of the JIM & JULIE CUT OUT. 
RYAN I brought those photos you were asking for... 
JULIE (LIGHTS UP) Oh great! They go over there. 
Julie points to a table and Ryan walks over. When he gets there, we see almost a hundred photos pinned to a map of America. It's overwhelming. All of a sudden, his effort seems miniscule. 
Ryan begins to pin his photos on the map over the cities where they were taken. He backs away to see it as a whole and his addition has already become invisible. 
Ryan returns to the conversation with his sister and Alex. 
RYAN There were quite a few already up there. Almost couldn't find room. 
JULIE I know, isn't it great how everyone chipped in? 
RYAN What gave you the idea to do something so... 
ALEX (HELPS) ... Substantial? 
JULIE Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg invested in this real estate venture right now. So when we went over our finances, a honeymoon just didn't seem affordable this second... So I thought... Hey, just because we can't travel doesn't mean we can't have pictures. 
The idea of this lands on Ryan pretty hard. 
ALEX It was a great idea. 
JULIE Thanks. 
CUT TO: 
AN HOUR LATER 
Ryan is stuck with Jim, talking real estate. Alex is having a chat with the brides maids about local relationship drama. 
JIM It's sixty acres up against the foothills. I subdivided the old Lazy W Ranch and took a nice slice for myself. 
RYAN Sounds nice. 
Jim makes an exhale noise that means "you bet your ass". 
JIM Homes will go in the high fours. 
RYAN Must be a nice development. 
JIM (CORRECTING) It's a community, not a development. The concept is turn-key everything. You buy a maintenance contract with the home. We'll whack your weeds, we'll even change the light bulb. Furniture? You buy your own or choose a package. Seamless traditionalism, yet all the perks. 
RYAN Nice. 
Ryan and Alex make eye contact. There's a joy in their connection amongst the ramblings of their company. 
JIM We all need a place to call our own. This is America. This is what we were promised. 
RYAN That's a nice touch. 
JIM What? 
RYAN That bit at the end about promise... I like it. 
JIM (a little embarrassed) Thanks. (LEADING) So, you still renting that one- bedroom? 
RYAN I gave it up. 
JIM (SURPRISED) You own now? 
RYAN No.

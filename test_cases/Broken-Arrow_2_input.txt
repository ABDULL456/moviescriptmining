INT. NEST HELICOPTER 
SIX very serious-looking SOLDIERS are in black radiation suits, listening to COLONEL HUNT, 45, over headsets. 
HUNT Listen up, sportsfans. Word is, this particular broken arrow has broken open. Our ETA Utah is ninety-six minutes. I want everyone to take that time to triple-check the seams and seals on their E-suits. Let's go! 
INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM 
Giles looks at Wilkins. 
GILES You think I'm nuts. You don't think NEST or the satellite will find anything weird. 
WILKINS That's right. 
(BEAT) But it wouldn't hurt to get some gunships fueled just in case. Wilkins reaches for a phone. Giles smiles. 
EXT. HELICOPTER EXPLOSION SITE 
The helicopter wreck burns. Hale looks over the terrain. 
HALE How do they get out of here? 
TERRY Get out? I don't think that helicopter's going anywhere. 
HALE Deak'd have a back-up. He'd be prepared. 
TERRY If they've got trucks they could take the four-wheel-drive trail we were on. 
HALE He wouldn't want to go towards town. 
TERRY He could go to the river. Hale looks at Terry -- that's exactly what Deakins would do. 
EXT. 4WD TRAIL 
The two Humvees roll along the narrow, twisting trail. 
IN THE SECOND HUMVEE Kelly drives, Deakins beside him, Johnson and Pritchett in back. 
DEAKINS You a fan of boxing, Mr. Pritchett? 
PRITCHETT I think it's barbaric. 
DEAKINS Me, too! I love it! Two men trying to do as much damage to the other as he can. As basic as you can get, don't you think? 
PRITCHETT I think it should be banned. 
DEAKINS So do I! God, wouldn't that make it more exciting? Having to go into dark alleys and basements to see a fight? I bet we see eye-to- eye on a lot of things, Mr. Pritchett. Deakins grins; Mr. Pritchett steams. 
EXT. CANYONLANDS 
Hale and Terry stand on an outcropping overlooking the 4WD trail. 
THEIR POV The two Humvees make their way along the trail. 
HALE See the one in front? It just has a driver? They wanted to keep the weight down. It has the nukes. Hale takes Terry's gun from her. 
TERRY You gonna shoot out the tires? 
HALE Humvees can reseal and inflate with the flick of a switch. That's why Deak chose 'em. Terry looks at Hale -- then what is he going to do? 
HALE I'm gonna steal it. (checks gun) You get to a phone and call McMurran. 
TERRY The nearest phone is a two-hour walk. 
HALE Then you better start walking. 
TERRY Look, I know my way around here. You're gonna need me.

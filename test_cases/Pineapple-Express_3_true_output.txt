Dale notices Red quivering as he lights a cigarette and becomes increasingly suspicious. 
SAUL We were in the forest laying low. Thinking. 
DALE Uh, Red...what...uh, is your lip okay? 
Saul finally notices Red's dishevelled appearance. 
SAUL Whoa! Dude, have you been crying? 
RED What? Oh, I uh... (feeling his split lip) ...I got a cold sore, I've never got one before. I started crying. 
SAUL A cold sore? Is that fucking herpes? 
RED ...uh, yeah, man. 
SAUL Ewwww! That's sick, man. Do you know how many joints we've shared? I told you, man. This is from that time you ate the lollypop straight from the strippers sna- 
DALE Saul. Ask him. 
SAUL (to Dale) Okay, Captain Demando. Can you just chill out, maybe? So, Red. I gotta ask- 
RED Okay, first of all, stop. What's this all about? That's what I want to know. 
SAUL Alright. Well, Dale's a servant for protest lawyers, and- 
DALE Whoa, whoa! Saul, I don't think...well, Red, I don't mean to be rude but I don't think we should tell you any more than you need to know. 
RED Fuck that, Dale. This is my house, I deserve to know. 
SAUL Dude! Let's just tell him. It is his house. 
DALE Look. Red, I just don't want to pull you into the shit we're in. It's just trouble. 
SAUL Don't be weird about this. If he wants trouble, it's his right to have it. 
RED Whoa! Whoa! I don't want trouble. 
DALE That's why we only need to clarify one thing - nobody's called about Saul or the pineapple express or anything like that? 
RED No one. Nada. 
SAUL Awesome! Look at that! Everything's fine. We had a crazy night in the woods, which I assume we can both put behind us like grown ups, and now we can use Red's giant bong to get super-duper high. 
Dale doesn't seem convinced. Saul picks up Red's huge bong and starts to pack a bit of Red's weed into it. 
RED Alright, well, wicked. Make yourselves at home. I'm just going to use the ol' telephone-o. 
Saul sits down and picks up a lighter as Red walks towards the phone. Dale watches Red, suspicious of his odd behavior. Red begins to dial... 
SMACK! Dale knocks the phone out of Red's hand. 
RED (CONT'D) What the fuck! 
Saul jumps up. Dale SNATCHES the phone and backs up. 
DALE I'm sorry! I'm sorry! 
SAUL Dale!   What the fuck are you doing? 
DALE (to Saul) We can't let him call anyone! He's acting weird! 
RED Fuck you man - this is my house! 
DALE I'm sorry. I just, I don't think I can- 
SAUL Dale! You fucking nut. You're stoned and paranoid. Just chill the shit out, guy! (to Red) I'm sorry, Red. I shouldn't have brought this guy over here, he's a total lunatic. 
Without warning, Red grabs a LARGE ASHTRAY filled with cigarette butts and WHIPS it at Dale. BAM! It smashes him in the head!!! 
DALE (in pain) AAAHHH! 
Ash EXPLODES everywhere as Dale drops the phone and clutches his head. 
SAUL Holy cock! 
Red approaches the cowering Dale. Saul intercedes. 
SAUL (CONT'D) Dude! He's sorry! Wait!

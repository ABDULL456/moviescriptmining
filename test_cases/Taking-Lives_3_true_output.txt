INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - LATE NIGHT 
Grace drives.     Costa in the passenger seat. 
COSTA 
The night started out great. Everything gelled. Everyone was happy. You helped land a big fish and the feeding frenzy started. Six figure pieces were flying off the wall. (shivers) He said he was going to blow out my spine. I was thinking surgery. Six months in bed. Exercise pools. Never walking again. Grace looks at him.     Costa is worried. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COSTA 
He was in my bathroom and none of you could stop him. I need to leave town. 
GRACE 
That might be a good idea. Until then I'll check under your bed for monsters. Costa looks at her.     Grace gives him a warm, open stare. 
COSTA 
I would appreciate that very much. (a beat) Can I profile you? I read your book. 
GRACE 
Please, don't. 
COSTA 
Thirty-something, single white female. Best schools best grades. Discovers adrenaline policing the inner city. 
GRACE 
(cuts in) John, stop it. Please. Let's shift the conversation from me and my business onto something inbounds. 
COSTA 
Okay. Are you going to my funeral when Martin Asher cuts my throat? They both know she's been lowballing the threat. We can tell Grace is truly concerned for Costa's welfare. 
COSTA 
You let him get away. Grace takes that hard. 
GRACE 
No excuses.   I'm sorry. 
COSTA 
I meant you in the general sense. (a beat) Can you catch him? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GRACE 
We got his name. We catch everyone sooner or later. 
COSTA 
Sooner, please. 
INT. COSTA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (3:33 A.M.) 
Spacious, lofty.     Costa and Grace enter. 
COSTA 
Careful. Costa scoots aside a pile of clothing.       The newspapers. Cool art, sketches, images all over the walls. Reminiscent of Grace's hotel room. And a very cool view of downtown. Grace taking everything in. Art books, sketch pads. Piled high on the desk. She looks at the ceiling. SEES notes and sketches taped up. Grace laughs to herself. 
COSTA 
I'm sorry. It's a sty.    Must be a profiling mother lode. 
GRACE 
I'm done profiling you.   I got you figured out. 
COSTA 
A failed healer, a failed artist. Grace looking at a drawing on the wall.       Costa winces, he didn't want her to notice it. 
GRACE 
Is that how you see yourself? 
COSTA 
No. That's you. I did it last night. 
GRACE 
This is how you see me? 
COSTA 
No. It's how I think you see yourself. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GRACE 
And how do you see me? Costa licks his lips.

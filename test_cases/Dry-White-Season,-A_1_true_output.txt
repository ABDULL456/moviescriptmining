At the back of police headquarters, John Vorster Square. An elderly black cleaner, emptying garbage, is being shown Jonathan's photograph. He looks -- and nods -- pointing down as meaning the basement. 
K) CLOSE ON STANLEY'S FACE END MONTAGE. 
INT. LEWINSON'S OFFICE - DAY He is with a client.    He pushes a button on the intercom. 
LEWINSON ... Freda -- I said no calls... Oh... Right... put them through. Hallo! Yes! How are you?... that is correct. 
He listens -- his face slowly becoming solemn -- LEWINSON Very well. Thank you for finally letting us know. He replaces the receiver... looks at it for a long second ... before lifting his eyes to the client. 
LEWINSON (to client) Sorry. He dials a number. INT. DAN PIENAAR SCHOOL - STAFF ROOM - DAY Tea break for the teachers, Ben       among them. He is enjoy- ing a laugh with his colleagues       -- maybe in Afrikaans -- we should hear the language here       where we need not com- prehend. An African serves the        tea. There's a KNOCK -- a monitor comes in and talks to Ben who follows him outside. INT. SCHOOL - DAY Ben at the phone. 
BEN Hello, Dan... No... it's all right... 
INT. LEWINSON'S OFFICE - DAY LEWINSON I'm sorry. They have just officially informed me. The boy was never in detention. He died ... the day of the riots and as nobody came to claim the corpse he was buried a month ago. 
INT. SCHOOL - DAY Ben at the phone. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: BEN Thanks a lot, Dan... I'll tell Gordon. 'Bye. Ben hangs up and stays there... thinking... until the BELL snaps him out of his thoughts. 
EXT. DAN PIENAAR SCHOOL - PLAYING FIELDS - DAY The playing fields, not of Eton but as good as... 
... Cries and whistles rise through the still, warm air from a game of schoolboy rugby being played below us by immaculately-fitted teams. 
On another part of the field Gordon's lawnmower off to the side -- two figures pace -- slowly -- one white, one black -- A VOICE overlays all this... strange... ironically African. GORDON Mister Ben, sir. If it was me, all right. And if it was Emily, all right. We are not young. But he's out child. My time and your time, it's passing. But the time of our children is coming. And now if they kill our children -- if we let them -- what is it that we lived for? BEN (places a hand on Gordon's shoulder -- comforting) What can we do, Gordon? You or I... We can't change it. GORDON That day, Mr. Ben, sir, when they whipped Jonathan, you also said we can do nothing. But if we had... if someone heard what we had to say this would not have happened. 
BEN It's a terrible thing, Gordon -- God knows I'm sorry. But you have other children to live for... I'll help them too with their schooling. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: GORDON (interrupting) How did he die, Mister Ben, sir? BEN I told you, Gordon... He died on the day of the riots. 
GORDON That's what  they say. But I got to know for  certain. How can I have peace?   I must know how my son died and  where they buried him. 
The game on the next pitch finishes with a pierce of the whistle. The kids run off past Ben and Gordon. Gordon climbs onto the small lawn mower and STARTS the ENGINE. BEN Gordon.   The police -- if they've said... GORDON I don't care what they say. He is my child. God is my witness today: I cannot stop before I know what happened and where he lies. His body belongs to Emily and me. And drives away -- chugging across the field... leaving Ben -- helpless -- behind him -- watching. From his: OFFICE WINDOW 
in the school behind -- a worried headmaster watches. We hear his voice over. 
CLOETE (V.O.) ... This business of Gordon's son. Be careful, Ben. These are not normal times -- one has to make allowances. 
CUT TO: EXT. CAR PARK 
The car park. He and Ben are getting into their cars at the end of the day. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: BEN Don't worry! I'm no crusader. I've known Gordon a long time, that's all. CLOETE I understand -- it's your Christian duty to your neighbor. BEN Something like that -- yes. 
CLOETE Just don't get too close. Teachers must stay out of politics. Love to Susan! 
And drives off, leaving Ben watching him, shaking his head at the man's obtuseness. EXT. NGUBENE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON Emily is watering a tiny vegetable plot in the yard, with a bucket and a pierced tin. Robert is playing nearby with the youngest child. Robert sees Gordon walking slowly to their house and says playfully to the baby: ROBERT Look who's coming? It's baba! Emily turns to look. She immediately realizes that some- thing is wrong. She drops the tin and walks a few steps toward the gate. 
Gordon sees her and stops. Emily starts to break down. 
EMILY Oh, no... oh no, Lord. Gordon hurries to embrace her. 
EMILY (sobbing and repeating) Please don't tell me... 
Gordon starts to lead her to the house. 
Margaret, Emily's neighbor, comes, hurries, helps her, comforts her, escorting them to the house.

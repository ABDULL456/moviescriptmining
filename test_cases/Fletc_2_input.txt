MRS. STANWYK Oh God, I hate things that start like that.... 
FLETCH Gail, please. 
She sits in a chair. he hands her the wedding photo. 
FLETCH I got this from Alan's parents. By the way, they see him all the time. 
First she looks at Fletch with puzzlement. Then, she looks at the photo and can't seem to decide what to think of it. But she knows it's bad. 
MRS. STANWYK What is this.... 
FLETCH I checked. There was no divorce. 
MRS. STANWYK Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist??? 
FLETCH I'm telling you he's not your husband at all. 
She is stunned. 
FLETCH And they're leaving the country tomorrow night. 
MRS. STANWYK (rocked) Bastard. 
FLETCH I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow. 
MRS. STANWYK I'm calling the police. Right now. 
FLETCH You cant do that. 
MRS. STANWYK Don't tell me I can't --- 
FLETCH They're trying to kill me! 
She is taken aback by that, but there is a determination in her eyes. 
MRS. STANWYK Your twenty-four hours are up, Fletch. 
She starts for the phone, but he stops her. 
FLETCH You're going to have to trust me, Gail. You have to. Now listen to me: he's expecting you to go to your meeting tomorrow night. Do it. Stay out of the house. 
There is a long beat. 
MRS. STANWYK I'm terrified. 
FLETCH Come here. 
He puts his arms around her and holds her tight against him. After a few seconds she raises her head and turns the hug into a kiss. Then the kiss turns passionate.

234 EXT. BEACH - DAY - WIDER 
The usual scene-- a mix of teeny-boppers, junkies and surfers. Into the f.g. step a couple of "surfers." They're wearing wet suits and carrying surfboards, but they're obviously cops. They sit down. Across the beach, a Sufi, dressed in a turban and flowing garments, crosses the sand. 
SURFER COP A Sufi junkie. 
The cops laugh derisively and turn their attention else-where.

It's Fletch. he's got a beard pasted on, and nervously scans the beach.

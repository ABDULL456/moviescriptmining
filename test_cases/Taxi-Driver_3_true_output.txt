Travis does not respond. 
YOUNG PASSENGER Huh? (a beat) What do you think of that, huh? 
Travis shrugs, gesturing toward meter. 
YOUNG PASSENGER I'm gonna kill her with a .44 Magnum pistol. 
CAMERA returns to SEVENTH FLOOR WINDOW. Woman is standing in the light. 
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.) Did you ever see what a .44 can do to a woman's face, cabbie? (pause) Did you ever see what it can do to a woman's pussy, cabbie? 
Travis says nothing. 
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.) I'm going to put it right up to her, cabbie. Right in her, cabbie. You must think I'm real sick, huh? A real pervert. Sitting here and talking about a woman's pussy and a .44, huh? 
CAMERA CLOSES IN on Travis' face: He is watching the woman in the seventh floor window with complete and total absorption. It's the same glazed-over stare we saw in his eyes as he watched the porno movie. 
FADE TO: 
BROOKLYN STREET CORNER - DAY 
Travis stands near the corner wearing his boots, jeans, western shirt and army jacket. 
He pulls his aspiring bottle out of his pocket, shakes three or four into his palm, pops them into his mouth and chews. 
An "Off Duty" taxi pulls up to the curb. Travis gets in. 
INSIDE TAXI 
Dough-Boy leans back from the wheel and greets Travis as he enters. 
DOUGH-BOY Hey Travis. This here's Easy Andy. He's a travelling salesman. 
In the back seat, beside Travis, sits ANDY, an attractive young man about 29. He wears a pin-striped suit, white shirt and floral tie. His hair is modishly long. 
ANDY Hello Travis. 
Travis nods as the taxi speeds off. 
Dough-Boy slows down near an economy hotel. Not a flop house, but not do fancy they care what the guests do in the privacy of their rooms. 
ANDY This is fine, Dough-Boy (to Travis) Pay Dough-Boy here. 
Travis pulls a twenty out of his pocket and gives it to Dough-Boy. 
TRAVIS 20 bucks? 
DOUGH-BOY (takes bill) Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis. 
Travis and Andy get out of the cab and walk toward the hotel. Dough-Boy pulls away. 
As they enter the hotel, they pass a JUNKIE, stoned out and spread-eagled across the hood of a derelict old blue dodge. 
INT. HOTEL 
Travis follows Andy up the worn carpeted stairs and down the hallway.  Andy unlocks the door to one of the rooms. 
The HOTEL ROOM is barren and clean; there's no sign anyone is staying in it. The fire escape is appropriately near. 
Andy locks the door behind them, steps over to the closet, unlocks it and pulls out two grey Samsonite suitcases - the kind you can drive a truck over. 
ANDY Dough-Boy probably told you I don't carry any Saturday Night Specials or crap like that. It's all out of State, clean, brand new, top-of- the-line stuff. 
Andy places the suitcases on the white bedspread. The suitcases are equipped with special locks, which he quickly opens. 
Andy opens the suitcases: Stacked in grey packing foam are rows and rows of brand new hand guns. 
TRAVIS You got a .44 Magnum? 
ANDY That's an expensive gun. 
TRAVIS I got money.

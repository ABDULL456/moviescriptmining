HOOKER (urgently now) Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything? 
LORETTA No. 
HOOKER All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there. 
LORETTA What the hell for? 
HOOKER Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake. 
Cracks of concern begin to appear in Loretta's marble. 
LORETTA What does this guy want? 
HOOKER (evenly) He'd like to kill me. 
Loretta just looks at him a second.  Realizing that this is no joke, she turns and walks slowly but steadily to the bathroom.  Hooker waits until she's out of sight. 
EXT. STREET 
Hooker goes to the front door and steps outside.  Cole looks up at the sound of the door.  Hooker makes a big show of spotting him, and runs back into the diner.  Cole, his cover blown, draws his gun and races across the street in pursuit. Arriving just in time to see -- 
INT. DINER 
Hooker go into the bathroom, he charges in after him, only to find the place empty.  He goes quickly from stall to stall, on the chance that Hooker might be hiding in one of them. 
He comes to one that's closed, and seeing a pair of woman's legs under the door, rejects that, and moves on to the next one. 
We cut inside the stall to reveal Loretta sitting on the toilet with her skirt hiked up.  Right behind her, crouched on the back of the seat, is Hooker. 
Cole has finished his rapid inspection now, and having found nothing, looks around for Hooker's probable escape route. He sees the open window and climbs out to find himself in a small air shaft, from which he knows Hooker could not escape. Hooker, seizing the time, bursts out of the stall and runs back out through the diner.  Cole sees him, but too late to get off a shot.  He climbs back in the window and gives chase. 
EXT. STREET 
We pick up Hooker barreling down the street with Cole a hundred yards or so behind.  Hooker makes a sharp cut into an alley, and we see immediately that it's a hopeless dead end.  Inexplicably, he makes no attempt to run back out. 
Cole draws up and cuts into the alley, anticipating the kill which should be easy now.  He prepares to sight down his victim, when suddenly he realizes there is no victim in sight.  Hooker, miraculously, has vanished.  Cole scans the alley frantically for some trace of him.  There are no windows or doors at the street level.  Not even a drain pipe. Just brick wall.  It's impossible.  Hooker has disappeared into thin air. 
Cole slams his gun into his shoulder holster with a curse, and starts back out of the alley, when all of a sudden he stops in utter terror.  His mouth drops open and he chokes out the words: 
COLE Salino, hey look.  I didn't mean to move in on... 
Before anything else can come out, two bullets rip into his chest.  He falls to the concrete, coming to rest on a manhole cover, which we notice is slightly ajar.  We: 
CUT TO: 
THE SEWER PIPES 
Beneath the manhole.  We see Hooker making his way through the slop, having gained another reprieve, but unaware that with two down, there is still one to go. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOOKER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING 
Hooker comes in the front entrance and goes to the elevator, one of the old-fashioned kind with the iron grid on the inside.  He's still a little rattled and waiting for the elevator is making him restless.  It finally arrives, and he steps inside, closing the grid behind him.  As he starts to push the button for his floor, he realizes for the first time that he's not alone.  He looks to the corner to find Snyder, holding a gun on him.  This time there's not much doubt that he'll use it if necessary. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - EVENING 
Snyder brings Hooker into the crate room where Capt. Polk and the other Agents are waiting.  Polk, as usual, has his coat off, revealing his shoulder holster. 
POLK Hello, Mr. Hooker.  Captain Polk, F.B.I... (shoving a chair over to him) Have a seat. 
Hooker remains standing. 
POLK (ignoring it, drinking from a cup) You want a drink or something? 
HOOKER No. 
POLK We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff. 
HOOKER Don't think I know him. 
POLK Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.

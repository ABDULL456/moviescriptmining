PEASANT (pleading) Traficante de drugas, traficante de drugas! 
SUPER:  SUBTITLES -- "Drug dealer, drug dealer!" 
The soldier lets the peasant go. 
SOLDIER (to second peasant) Traficante de drugas o communista? 
SUPER:  SUBTITLES -- "Drug dealer or communist?" 
The peasant panics and bolts from the line.  The soldiers FIRE. 
SOLDIER Communista! 
He runs up to THE HOTEL MONTENEGRO.  A sign reads, "TV, POOL, WATERBEDS, DONKEY, KLEENEX" -- All but "KLEENEX" are crossed out.  He runs inside. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY 
A clean-cut AMERICAN COUPLE argue with Desk Clerk. 
YOUNG MAN (to Desk Clerk) We've lost all our travelers' checks! 
YOUNG WOMAN What are we going to do?! 
CLERK Calm down.  What kind were they? 
YOUNG MAN American Excess! 
The Clerk throws up his hands and strikes the same pose as the Karl Marden look-alike in the "AMERICAN EXCESS" poster, b.g. 
CLERK I'd say you're fucked. 
The boy passes them and bounds up the stairs. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM 
CLOSEUP of Ted pacing. 
TED (to self) Next thing I know, I'm the chief test pilot for the XR-2300, NASA's first Mercury shuttle.  That is, until I report she's got more flaws than the Titanic. 
LOOSEN slowly to find the Cross empty and the man who was on it hanging, his feet dangling next to Ted. 
TED Now I'm testing old F-l8s for some crazy Generalissimo who thinks there's a commie behind every tree in the Amazon. 
SUDDENLY the boy bursts in. 
BOY Senor Ted!  Look! 
Ted spins and the paper stays still.  He stops. 
TED My God!  They're launching the ZR-2300. Do you know what that is, Jose? 
BOY The muffler bracket for a '78 Pinto. 
TED No, that's an XR-2200.  The XR-2300 is the Mercury shuttle.  They can't do it! 
EXT. HOTEL MONTENEGRO 
Ted races out. 
TED Taxi! 
SFX:  A DOZEN CARS SCREECH AND CRASH INTO EACH OTHER.  HORNS STICK. 
ANGLE ON PILE OF CARS 
Ted jumps into the taxi on bottom of pile.  The driver POUNDS on his HORN -- it CONTINUES TO BLARE as they pull away, dragging other taxis. 
TED Houston, Texas. 
DRIVER Houston, Texas, senor?? 
TED Right at the corner, left at the light. Here's a map and step on it! 
Ted throws a map onto the floor of the front seat.  The driver steps on the map. 
EXT. TERMINAL, PASSENGER ARRIVALS - NIGHT 
An old truck loaded high with furniture pulls up.  A YOUNG MAN and his PARENTS, looking like the family from THE GRAPES OF WRATH, get out. 
SON We finally made it, Ma.  Mercury.  We're gonna start all over agin.  A whole new life. 
MUSIC:  OPTIMISTIC. 
SON Where the soil is rich. 
He bends down and takes a handful of earth from the terminal sidewalk and lets it run through his fingers. 
SON And the union strong.  Where men are free to realize their true potential. 
A black PORTER approaches and grabs a bag at the bottom of their pile of junk. 
PORTER Can I help you? 
SON Where black men and white men, working together, can move mountains. 
The Porter pulls the bag and the entire mountain of junk cascades to the ground. 
ANGLE ON TED'S TAXI ARRIVING 
It is covered in mud, flames shoot out from under the hood, the HORN BLARES.  The driver flips off the meter which reads, "874,567,004,500,000,000."  The numbers run off the meter along a special attachment. 
DRIVER That'll be eight hundred and seventy-four zillion quastavitas.

{"train": "AFTER.LIFE \nWritten by \nAgnieska Wojtowicz-Vosloo \nREVISED 10/07/08 \nINT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - DAY \nBLINDING WHITENESS We hear a MAN GASPING softly.     Rhythmically. A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing whiteness. Gradually we realize we're moving across the ALABASTER BODY of a WOMAN. Her skin translucent. \nON THE WOMAN'S FACE Ethereal.   Her eyes closed.     Her face lifeless.   Then... ...her eyes open. She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes. This is ANNA (late 20s). We pull back. PAUL (30s) makes love to Anna. Their movements perfunctory. Passionless. He turns to look at her. Realizes she's not there. He suddenly stops. Rolls off her. Sits on the edge of the bed. \nPAUL What's wrong? \nANNA Nothing. Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor. \nPAUL \n(SIGHS WEARILY) You used to enjoy it. Now it's... He shakes his head.    Frustrated.   Lights a cigarette. \nPAUL ...it's like fucking a corpse. Paul immediately realizes he's gone too far.      Turns to Anna. \nPAUL Shit.   I'm sorry.   That was-- Anna gets out of bed. Walks towards the bathroom.       Paul puts his head in his hands. \nINT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThrough the fogged shower partition we see the blurred ghostly figure of Anna. Paul walks in. \nPAUL Anna. I'm sorry. That was a stupid thing to say.   But you know sometimes... sometimes it's like you're not here anymore. Like you're somewhere else. \nAnna doesn't reply. \nPAUL Is this about us? \nON ANNA her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her. \nANNA It's not about us. \nPAUL (O.C.) Then what is it? \nANNA I don't know. \nPAUL (O.C.) I just want us to be happy. Anna doesn't move.    We sense the emptiness inside her. \nPAUL (O.C.) Are you happy? She closes her eyes.    Forces herself to reply. \nANNA I'm happy. \nA DROP OF BLOOD falls into the water.   Then another drop. \nON ANNA her nose is bleeding. She touches her lips. Looks impassively at the blood on her fingertips. The SOUND OF WATER carries into the next scene... \nFADE TO WHITE. \nA STREAM OF CRYSTAL BLUE WATER A MAN'S HANDS penetrate the water. Thin and elegant. Perfectly manicured. Turning slowly as he washes them meticulously. He picks up a crisply folded white towel. Dries his hands carefully. Snaps on white latex gloves. \nEXT. CEMETERY - MORNING \nA beautiful morning. We move through a tranquil cemetery. Pastoral and idyllic. Dappled light falls through old trees onto statues of grieving angels. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS \nA path leads to an old well-kept house. Amongst a blaze of violet tulips we see a sign: Eliot Deane. Funeral Home. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. CASKET DISPLAY ROOM - MORNING \nJACK I think it's dead. Anna reaches in.   Tenderly picks up the chick. \nANNA No.   The poor thing's just scared. \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - DAY \nSchool's over. Anna listlessly corrects a stack of exercise books. She can't focus. Pulls out a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes a pill into her hand. Swallows it dry. \nINT. LAW OFFICE. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nPaul works with half a dozen COLLEAGUES around a large conference table covered with documents and thick files. He reaches across to a pizza box. It's empty. \nPAUL OK.   Who took the last pepperoni? A PREPPY GUY slides across another pizza box. \nPAUL Great.  Broccoli. (lifts out a slice) Who the fuck ordered broccoli? NEAL, a thin pallid guy, looks up. \nNEAL Oh that's just disgusting. \nPREPPY GUY What's wrong with vegetarian pizza?   It's healthy. \nNEAL Pizza isn't supposed to be healthy. Paul glances at his watch. Suddenly realizes the time. He quickly picks up his cell phone. Heads for the door. \nNEAL You ordering in another pizza? \nPAUL Yeah.    With wheatgrass and alfalfa sprouts. Everyone laughs. \nPREPPY GUY \n(MUTTERS) Yeah. Yeah. Smart asses. \nINT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER \nPaul walks into the corridor dialling his cell phone. \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - SAME TIME \nAnna's cell phone rings as she closes her locker. She fishes it out from her bag as she heads to the door. Checks the ID. Hesitates. Then takes the call. \nINT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME \nPaul cups his cell.    Worried he'll be overheard. \nPAUL Hi baby.    I'm really sorry about this morning.    I fucked up. I know. \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME \nAnna steps into an empty corridor. \nPAUL (O.S.) \n(FILTERED) We still on for tonight? \n(BEAT) Anna? \nANNA I don't know Paul. \nINT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME \nPaul's anxious.    We sense he's hiding something. \nPAUL Please Anna.    It took me weeks to get the table. \nANNA (O.S.) \n(FILTERED) Maybe we can change it to Thursday-- \nPAUL No.     It has to be tonight. \nJACK Yes.    It will be fun. \nThey reach Anna's car.    Stand in silence for a moment. \nANNA Jack. Those boys.    Do they bother you a lot? Jack hesitates.    Then slowly nods his head. \nANNA You know you can always talk to me about it if you want to. He nods.   Anna's clearly worried about him. \nANNA You sure you don't need a ride? Jack shakes his head.    Anna glances at her watch. \nANNA Well.   I better run. \nJACK Where are you going? \nANNA \n(HESITATES) I have to go to a funeral.   My old piano teacher. \nJACK (with sudden interest) Can I come? \nANNA No Jack.   Funerals are very private affairs. \nJACK I've never been to a funeral. \nANNA It wouldn't be appropriate Jack. Anyway wouldn't your mom worry about you? \nJACK \n(SHRUGS) Not really. \nANNA I'm sure she would. I'll see you tomorrow in class. Have a wonderful birthday. Jack nods disappointed.   Anna watches him walk away then gets in her car. \nINT. ANNA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER \nAnna slips her key into the ignition. Loud music suddenly blares from the car radio. She switches it off. Squeezes the bridge of her nose. She pulls out a bottle of pills from her bag. It's empty. She rummages in the glove compartment. Finds another bottle. Empty. She sighs. \nEXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER \nJack sits on the bench. Watches Anna drive away. Then unzips his backpack. Something moves inside. A strange jerky movement. Jack closes the backpack. Glances up and down the empty street. Then walks away on his own. \nEXT. STRIP MALL. PHARMACY - DAY \nAnna steps out of the Pharmacy. As she washes down a pill with a bottle of water she notices a small Hair Salon. Looks critically at herself in the Pharmacy window. Anna moves over to the Salon. Reaches for the door handle... then hesitates. She's about to walk away when the Salon door suddenly opens. Anna smiles shyly as a freshly COIFFURED WOMAN politely holds the door for her. \nINT. HAIR SALON - DAY \nAnna leans back against a washbasin.    Her neck tightly cradled against the white porcelain.    The light's harsh and not particularly flattering. She    closes her eyes. Behind her the HANDS of a HAIRDRESSER   in latex gloves begin to rinse dye from Anna's hair. \nON SINK Startling white. A stream of water flows into the sink. Then after a moment the spiralling clear water gradually turns a deep crimson red. \nINT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. HALLWAY - DAY \nAnna closes the front door behind her. She smiles as she catches her reflection in the hallway mirror. Her hair a dark vibrant red. Just then, from another room, we hear an OLD WOMAN'S hacking cough. \nOLD WOMAN (O.S.) Anna?   Is that you? \nANNA Yes Mother. \nINT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nAnna's mother, BEATRICE (50s), sits in bed, knitting with swift, violent precision. The bedside table's stacked with medication. She's clearly been bed-ridden for some time. An electric wheelchair in the corner of the room. Anna appears at the door. Beatrice scrutinizes her for a second. Then returns to her knitting. \nBEATRICE Terrible color. Anna moves to the beside table.   Picks up a dirty plate. \nANNA Can I get you something to eat? \nBEATRICE I'm not hungry. \nMRS. HUTTON White roses. They were his favorite. How did you know? \nELIOT They just seemed appropriate somehow. \nMRS. HUTTON He looks so peaceful. As if he's only sleeping. Anna approaches Mrs. Hutton.   She doesn't notice Eliot watching her carefully. \nANNA Mrs. Hutton.    I'm so sorry. \nMRS. HUTTON Thank you Anna. You were always his favorite student. \nAnna smiles awkwardly.     Uncomfortable. \nMRS. HUTTON How's your mother? \nANNA Fine.   She sends her condolences. \nMRS. HUTTON You look tired dear. \nANNA No.   I'm fine. Everything's fine. But we can see in her eyes that everything's not fine. Mrs. Hutton nods, then turns to greet another MOURNER. Anna steps nervously up to the coffin. \nANNA'S POV James Hutton lies peacefully amongst the velvet trimming. Suddenly his LIPS PART... as he GASPS SOFTLY. \nVIEWING ROOM Anna steps back terrified. Stares at Hutton. His face serene again. It must have been her imagination. She glances up quickly. Embarrassed. Eliot's still observing her.     He nods to her cordially. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY \nA spartan room at the top of the house. Eliot carefully pins a POLAROID of Hutton lying in a coffin to the wall. Next to Hutton's photograph, we briefly glimpse the edge of ANOTHER POLAROID. Eliot stares intently at Hutton's image for a moment, then takes off his jacket and moves to the window. \nELIOT'S POV Anna's by her car rummaging in a bag for her keys. Getting increasingly frustrated. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY \nAnna suddenly looses it. Angrily dumps the contents of her bag onto the driveway. She kneels down. Grabs the keys. Throws the rest of her things back into the bag. She stands. Leans against the car. She looks weary. She glances up at the sky desperately trying to hold back her tears. Black storm clouds gather on the horizon. \nAnna brusquely wipes away her eyes with the back of her hand. Pulls herself together. Angry with herself. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY \nEliot watches intently as Anna drives away. \nINT. RESTAURANT - EVENING \nPaul sits at a window table. It's raining hard outside. He glances at his watch then nervously checks his pockets. Pulls out a RING BOX. He looks at it for a moment then slips it back into his pocket. As he refills his glass, Anna appears outside holding her raincoat above her head. She stares at Paul for a moment through the window marbled with rain. Paul suddenly notices Anna at the window.   He starts. Spills some of his red wine on his shirt. CLOSE on the red stain. It unfurls like a flower. Spreading out over the white material. \nANNA (O.C.) Sorry about that. Paul dabs the stain with a napkin. \nPAUL You scared the life out of me. Anna laughs as she sits down.   Paul looks up at her. \nPAUL Your hair. \nANNA You don't like it. \nPAUL I didn't say that. It's just very... red. I mean it's not really you is it? A WAITER appears at the table before Anna can reply. \nWAITER Are you ready to order? \nPAUL Yes.    We'll have the duck. \nANNA Paul. \nPAUL What?    You always have the duck here. \nANNA (picks up the menu) I don't always have the duck. Paul shrugs. Pours Anna some wine as she looks through the menu. The Waiter taps his pen on his pad impatiently. Anna sighs. Puts the menu aside. \nANNA I'll have the duck. Paul smiles as the Waiter leaves. Anna tries to ignore him. But after a second she can't help smiling back. \nPAUL The duck is very good. Anna's smile broadens. The tension between them broken for the moment. Paul reaches across. Touches her hand. \nPAUL Anna. Open the door. Please. I want you to come with me. I want to... \nINT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nAnna can't hear him above the sound of the RAIN HAMMERING onto the car. She shakes her head. Puts the car in drive. \nEXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS \nPaul stumbles aside as Anna's car pulls away. She stops at the parking lot exit a short distance away. \nINT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nAnna looks up into the rearview mirror. \nON REARVIEW MIRROR Paul stands forlornly in the rain.      Their eyes meet. \nANNA'S CAR She hesitates.       For a moment we think she might go back to him... \nEXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS \n... but then Anna pulls out and drives away. Leaving Paul alone in the parking lot. The rain pounding the asphalt. \nINT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nAnna peers through the blurred windshield as the wipers battle with the TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR. A LARGE TRUCK plows past menacingly on the rain-slicked highway. Anna's still upset. She wipes away her tears. On the dashboard the kitschy doll bobs its head from side to side. Anna picks up her cell phone. Glances down as she dials a number. She looks up... a WHITE VAN with black tinted windows cuts in front of her. \nANNA Shit! Anna swerves into the next lane.      We hear the blaring horn from the car behind her. \nANNA (into rear-view mirror) OK. OK. I saw you. \n(MUTTERING) Jerk. The cell phone connects.      We hear Paul's answering machine. \nANNA Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up?      I just don't want it to end like this. Anna drops the phone into her bag on the passenger seat. Wipes away the mist on the inside of the glass. A TRACTOR TRAILER shudders past loaded with metal pipes. \nON METAL PIPES The badly loaded pipes BANG OMINOUSLY against each other. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING \nDarkness.   A bright light comes on. CLOSE ON a MAN'S HANDS. Turning slowly under a stream of crystal blue water. We pull back. Eliot dries his hands. Opens a cabinet. Takes out a pair of latex gloves. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EARLY MORNING \nA large room. Tall vaulted ceilings. White tiles. Soft morning light seeps in from a small round window set high on one wall. The room is silent. Still. Like a chapel. In the semi-darkness we see a BODY on a porcelain slab covered with a white sheet. We hear a key turn in a lock. Then another lock.       The room's suddenly flooded with a harsh white light. Eliot steps inside the room. He takes off his jacket. Carefully places it on a coat-hanger. Puts on a pale blue smock then snaps on the latex gloves. His every move meticulous. Measured. Like a ritual. Eliot walks over to the slab, his surgery clogs softly clacking against the tiled floor. He looks at the slab for a moment then slowly pulls the sheet away revealing... ANNA'S BODY. Pale and lifeless. An ugly gash above her eyebrow. Cracked violet lips. A rip in her black dress soaked with a dark stain. She's only wearing one shoe. Eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist. Places it inside a brown paper bag. Eases off the shoe. Picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel trolley. Delicately slices open her dress. Peels it off. He's about to cut the straps of her RED SLIP when... Anna OPENS HER EYES. She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes. Strangely Eliot's not surprised.   He calmly steps back. Watches her carefully. Anna's eyes slowly focus on Eliot.     She's groggy.   Confused. \nANNA Where am I? She talks with difficulty.       Her breathe labored. \nELIOT You're in a funeral home. \n(BEAT) You're dead. Anna's vacant eyes widen in shock. She struggles to sit up but she can't even raise her head. Her body stiff. Rigid. Eliot speaks to her calmly. Soothingly. \nELIOT You had a car accident. It was raining. You hit a truck loaded with metal pipes. She looks fearfully at the bloodied dress in Eliot's hand. \nANNA I'm not dead. \nELIOT You were pronounced dead eight hours ago. Your blood no longer circulates through your body. Your brain cells are slowly dying. Your body's already decomposing. \nANNA I'm not dead. Eliot looks at her sadly for a moment. He places the bloodied dress on the trolley. Then picks up a document. Holds it up for her. \nON DOCUMENT It's Anna's death certificate. \nELIOT (O.C.) This is your death certificate. Cause of death. Massive internal trauma. Time of death. 8.23PM. \nPREP ROOM \nELIOT You were dead on arrival. The attending physician signed here... (points to document) ...at 9.45 last night. I picked up your body from the hospital morgue at 12.10 this morning. Anna stares with horror at her death certificate, then at Eliot. He looks away. It pains him to see her so distressed. \nPAUL \n(INTO PHONE) It's me again. I must have just missed you at home. Call me when you get this. OK? \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - DAY \nPaul strides down an empty corridor. The flowers in his hand. Searching for Anna's classroom. \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nA TEACHER stands in front of the class holding a shell. \nTEACHER ... the shell grows slowly... The door opens. Paul steps into the classroom.    His smile fades as he realizes it's not Anna. \nPAUL Oh hi.   I'm looking for Anna Bryant. The Teacher quickly moves over.    Hustles Paul to the door. \nTEACHER \n(INDIGNANT) I'm sorry but you just can't-- \nPAUL I'm Anna's... fianc\u00e9e. Paul Conran.     I thought this was her class. The Teacher glances suspiciously at the flowers in his hand. \nPAUL We had a little misunderstanding last night. \nTEACHER \n(HESITATES) She didn't come in today. Jack's in the front row.   Following the conversation. \nPAUL Did she call in sick? \nTEACHER She hasn't called in at all. It's not like her. She always calls in. Paul's worried now.   Something's wrong. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY \nAnna lies rigidly on the slab. Her head turned to one side. Staring blankly at the wall. Her eyes glazed. Suddenly classical music fills the room. Anna frowns. Disoriented. She moves her head with difficulty. Nervously looks around. For a moment she doesn't know where she is. Then she sees Eliot by a CD player. She watches with trepidation as he approaches her. \nANNA Please don't hurt me. \nELIOT \n(SMILES) How can I hurt you?     You're already dead. \nANNA But I'm not dead. \nELIOT Then why are you here? Anna doesn't know what to say.   She turns her head away. A tear falls down her cheek. \nANNA Please. Just let me go. I won't go to the police. I won't tell anyone. Eliot moves her head back.   Gently wipes away her tear. \nELIOT You're still in denial. You have to trust me. I'm only here to help you. Eliot slides a wooden head-rest under her neck and studies her wounds, touching them delicately. Thinking about how to conceal them. He turns to a tray of instruments. Picks up a needle. Leans over Anna. The needle pierces her brow. Sliding cleanly through her skin. She doesn't feel any pain as Eliot carefully sews the wound. He's meticulous. Clearly very good at his job. Eliot glances at his watch. Picks up a SYRINGE and an AMPOULE OF AMBER LIQUID. Draws up the amber liquid. Anna's alarmed. She tries to pull back. \nELIOT Don't be scared. \nANNA What are you doing? \nELIOT This will relax your muscles. Stop the rigor mortis setting in so I can work on your body. He INJECTS Anna in the neck. Just then we hear a car pull up on the gravel driveway outside. \nELIOT \n(TO HIMSELF) Your mother's early. Anna's eyelids feel very heavy. Slowly her eyes close. Eliot pulls the white sheet over her body. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nA Nurse, DIANE (30s) follows Beatrice in her wheelchair as Eliot leads them through the hallway. \nELIOT I'm so very sorry Mrs. Bryant. It's always so tragic when you lose a child. \nBEATRICE I lost her years ago. He glances at her curiously.    Then gestures to his office. \n(WITHOUT TURNING) Anna was in a car accident last night. My daughter's dead. That's what happened. Paul stares at Beatrice's back in disbelief. \nPAUL A car crash?     When? Beatrice turns her wheelchair round to face Paul. \nBEATRICE \n(IRRITABLY) I don't know. \nDIANE They said it happened just before 8.30. \nPAUL But... we were at the restaurant... Beatrice glares at him.    She clearly blames him for Anna's death. \nBEATRICE You shouldn't have let her drive in that weather. Paul looks down guiltily at the flowers in his hand. \nPAUL No. She can't be dead.    There must be some mistake. \nBEATRICE There's no mistake. We just got back from the funeral home. Beatrice pushes a joystick on her wheelchair.   As she whirs past Paul she notices the flowers. \nBEATRICE \n(DRYLY) Flowers? How appropriate. Paul's not listening anymore.   Stunned. \nPAUL Why didn't you call me? \nBEATRICE You took her away from me.   I don't want you anywhere near her. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - DAY \nEliot turns on the taps.   Fills a copper kettle. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME \nSilence. O.S. a shuddering pipe bangs ominously. Anna opens her eyes abruptly as if waking from a deep sleep. She stares at us. Numb. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nCLOSE ON an exploding BLUE FLAME from a gas ring. We pull back. Eliot places a kettle on the ring. Then measures out exactly two spoons of tea from an ornate tin into a teapot. Meticulous in everything he does. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME \nCLOSE ON Anna's hand. Her fingers FLEX slightly. She pushes herself up awkwardly. Suddenly realizes something. She touches her wrist. Desperately searching for her pulse. Then frantically checks her neck. Panicking. She can't find her heartbeat. She stares at her hand. Then abruptly SLAMS it against the slab. Hard. She feels no pain. She does it again. Harder. Still nothing. \nANNA I must be in shock.     That's all.   It's just shock. She struggles to her feet. Stumbles groggily to the door. Tries the door handle. It's locked. She bangs on the door feebly. Then she hears something. She cocks her head. Follows the sound of Eliot's footsteps upstairs. \nANNA \n(HOARSE) Let me out! \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S OFFICE - DAY \nEliot's by his desk. Checking his appointment book. Whistling softly to himself. We can't hear Anna's cries. He pours a cup of tea. Adds a drop of milk. As he stirs his tea, he hears the sound of feet CRUNCHING on the gravel outside. He glances out the window. \nELIOT'S POV Paul stands in the middle of the driveway staring blankly at the Funeral Home. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nEliot steps out of the Funeral Home.     Heads towards Paul. \nELIOT Can I help you? Paul turns to him.   Pulled away from his thoughts. \nPAUL Mr. Deane? \nELIOT Yes. \nPAUL My name's Conran.      Paul Conran. Eliot smiles.    Holds out his hand. \nELIOT Of course. The lawyer. (off Paul's surprised look) It's a small town. In my line of work you get to know everyone eventually. As they shake, Eliot looks at Paul's hand strangely.    As if he senses something. \nANNA I don't believe you.   Why are you doing this to me? He shakes his head as he drops the towel into a small bin. \nELIOT You're all the same. You all blame me for your death. As if it were my fault. \nANNA No. You drugged me.    So my mother \nWOULDN'T-- \nELIOT The others. They just see you as a dead body on a slab. Only I can see you as you really are. \nANNA You're crazy! Eliot's taken aback.    Hurt. \nELIOT I'm a busy man. I don't have time for this. He heads to the door. Pulls out his keys and unlocks it. Just then he remembers something. Turns to her. \nELIOT Oh I nearly forgot.    How tall are you? \nANNA What!? He looks her up and down.   Gauging her height. \nELIOT Five seven. \nANNA Why..? \nELIOT I need to know how tall you are.   For your coffin. Anna's stunned. Eliot looks at her for a moment.     Then switches off the main lights. \nANNA Wait! He ignores her.   The door CLICKS shut behind him. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nEliot steps into the hallway. Stops by a vase of flowers. He plucks a dead petal. Crushes it. Curiously sniffs his fingers. Then heads to the casket room. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY \nCLOSE ON Anna's face. She looks empty. Dispirited. Just then something catches her attention... The light from the window glints off a pair of LARGE SCISSORS on the steel trolley. Anna stumbles to the trolley. Feeling her way through the semi-darkness. Grabs the scissors. Just then she notices a BODY, covered with a white sheet, lying on a gurney in the corner. She turns away. Scared. But then, almost against her will, she approaches the gurney. As if drawn to the body. She slowly pulls the sheet away... The dead body of an OLD WOMAN. Staring blindly at Anna with cloudy opaque eyes. Long greasy gray hair. Shaken, Anna pushes herself against the wall. \nANNA Oh God.   Please. I don't want to die. \nINT. JACK'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY \nJack carefully cuts something out of a local newspaper. The loud sounds of a TV blare from another room. \nON NEWSPAPER Schoolteacher Dies in Tragic Car Crash. \nINT. JACK'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThe curtains are drawn. JACK'S MOTHER sits in an armchair with her back to us watching TV. Jack walks in. \nJACK You were supposed to pick me up from school yesterday. His mother doesn't reply.   Jack moves in front of the TV. \nJACK I waited. His mother doesn't respond. \nEXT. STREETS - DAY \nJack furiously cycles through empty streets. Past identical suburban houses with identical prim lawns. He stops suddenly. Considering something. Then turns and cycles away purposely. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY \nEliot walks out of the funeral home. We pull back. Jack stands by his bicycle in the bushes watching him. Eliot looks up. As if sensing someone was spying on him. Jack steps back quickly behind a tree. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nA POLICE OFFICER talks on the phone as Paul walks in. \nPOLICE OFFICER \n(INTO PHONE) Hang on a sec. \n(TO PAUL) Mr. Conran. Heard about your girlfriend. I'm sorry. Paul nods.    Clearly doesn't want to talk about it. \nGIRL I am you. I've been waiting for you. You shouldn't have disappointed me. The Girl now looks strangely malevolent. Anna steps back terrified. Turns. But there's no door anymore. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME \nThe Old Woman stands alone in the middle of the room. Braiding her long hair. \nOLD WOMAN You're not ready. \nCUT TO A SEARING WHITENESS. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY \nA small congregation of MOURNERS sit in the white chairs. \"AVE MARIA\" plays quietly in the b.g. A MAN leans over the casket paying his respects. \nON CASKET The Old Woman.   Her long hair braided.   She looks serene. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME \n\"AVE MARIA\" filters into the room. Anna opens her eyes. She's confused. She gets up awkwardly. Looks around the room. The other slab's empty. The Old Woman's gone. Anna stumbles over to the trolley. Pushes it aside. Desperately searching for the tiny door. She touches the wall. There's nothing there. Frustrated she turns to a counter crowded with instruments. She sweeps her arm across the counter top in rage. Sending everything crashing to the floor. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY \nThe funeral's over. Eliot takes out a wilted bouquet of flowers from a vase. \nIn the b.g. Jack stands half-hidden in the doorway. Glancing around in fascination. A flower in his hand. \nELIOT (to Jack without looking up) Can I help you? Jack steps back timidly.   Eliot looks up.   Smiles. \nELIOT Then perhaps you can help me. (holds up the withered flowers) Could you throw these away for me? Jack nods hesitantly.   Moves over and takes the flowers. \nELIOT Thank-you. Eliot turns and arranges fresh flowers in the vase. \nON JACK as he looks at the wilted flowers.    He crushes a petal then sniffs his fingers. \nELIOT (O.C.) There's no life left in them. \nVIEWING ROOM Jack looks up.   Eliot's watching him carefully. \nELIOT They belong in the garbage. Jack turns to leave. \nELIOT I've seen you round here before. Jack's suddenly nervous. \nELIOT Did you know Mrs. Whitehall? \nJACK I thought it was Miss Bryant's funeral. \nELIOT Ah. Miss Bryant. No.       Her funeral's not until Friday. \nJACK Where is she now? Eliot considers the question for a moment. \nELIOT She's downstairs. \nJACK Why? \nELIOT Why?  Because she's not ready. \n(BEAT) Is the flower for her? \nJACK \n(NODS) She was my teacher. \nELIOT And you are? \nJACK Jack. Jack holds out his hand. A serious look on his face. Eliot's amused. He shakes Jack's hand. \nELIOT Well Jack.      What did you think? \n(WHISPERS) Paul. Paul turns quickly. Sees the open window. It's only the wind. He shivers. It suddenly got very cold. He gets up and closes the window. The WHISPERING starts again. This time from the bathroom. Paul walks over to the bathroom door. As he touches the door handle... the whispering STOPS. Paul hesitates. The room's strangely silent. He slowly opens the door... \nINT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nNothing. The bathroom's empty. Paul looks around nervously. He catches the reflection of his pallid face in the mirror. Leans wearily against the washbasin. \nWater DRIPS from a leaky pipe. The fluorescent bulb over the mirror CRACKLES softly. Paul turns on the taps. Splashes cold water on his face. He's about to reach for a towel when he senses something. He cocks his head slightly. A feeling. He turns and checks out the bathroom. Nothing. Paul dries his face. As he replaces the towel... the sound of dripping water ABRUPTLY STOPS. Silence. Suddenly the SHOWER STARTS RUNNING. Paul's paralyzed with fear. Steam wreathes the room in a cloud of vapor. He turns slowly towards the shower. \nPAUL'S POV Anna stands in front of the shower with her back to him. She slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook. Then her hand moves to her chest. There's a STRANGE WET SUCKING sound... ...as Anna rips out her heart and hangs it casually on the hook next to her bathrobe. \nON THE STILL BEATING HEART dripping crimson blood onto the bone white tiles. \nBATHROOM \nPAUL \n(WHISPERS) Anna. Anna turns slowly. Her skin's like alabaster. Unnaturally translucent. A bloody gash where her heart used to be. The steam from the shower curls around her like a mist. She looks hauntingly beautiful. Mesmerizing. A line of thick black fluid trickles from her nose. Paul turns away. Horrified. When he turns back a second later Anna's not there. The bathroom's empty. The shower's not even running. \nINT. JACK'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - EVENING \nJack opens the fridge. It's almost empty. He takes out a carton of milk. Sniffs it. Recoils from the smell. From the living room we hear the LOUD sound of a TV. \nJACK \n(SHOUTS) Mom!    We're out of milk. There's no reply.      Jack grabs his jacket. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EVENING \nAnna's still sitting on the floor. The place is clean and ordered again. She watches Eliot unzip a garment bag. He lifts out a plain black dress. \nANNA What's that? \nELIOT It's your dress. For your funeral. Your mother brought it round this morning. As Eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a plastic bag, Anna moves haltingly over to the dress. She touches the material puzzled. \nANNA This isn't my dress. (realizes with shock) This is my mother's dress! It was supposed to be for her funeral. Why has she given it to me? Eliot starts folding the plastic bag. He notices something else inside. He opens the bag. Hesitates then takes something out. \nON ELIOT'S HAND An old-fashioned wooden rosary. \nPREP ROOM Eliot looks at it for a moment. Then glances over at Anna. She's still staring at the dress. He opens a drawer beneath the counter. It's full of rosaries and printed Holy cards. He quickly drops the rosary into the drawer. Closes it. Then turns back to Anna. \nANNA It should have been her not me. (turns to Eliot) She was the one dying. Not me. Eliot unlocks the door. Jams it open with a door stop. Slips his keys back into his jacket pocket. Takes off his jacket and hangs it up. He moves over to a collapsible gurney folded on the floor. Bends down and snaps open the side-rails. Anna looks at the open door. \nANNA I'm not ready to die. Eliot looks up at Anna sadly. \nELIOT Why are you still struggling? \nANNA \n(PLAINTIVELY) I'm not ready to die.   Not yet. She glances at the open door again.    Eliot follows her look. \nELIOT There's nothing out there for you anymore. As Eliot turns back to the gurney, Anna notices Eliot's jacket hanging beside her. Realizes the KEYS are in the pocket. She quickly glances back at Eliot. He's still busy adjusting the gurney. She leans over to his jacket. \nON ELIOT as he gets up and turns to Anna. \nPREP ROOM Anna looks at him calmly. We can't tell if she managed to get his keys or not. Eliot pulls on his jacket and wheels the gurney through the door. He steps back into the room. Nudges the door stop away with his foot. \nELIOT I'll be back soon. The door locks behind him with a CLICK. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nEliot pushes the gurney to a WHITE VAN with black tinted windows (Note: The same kind of van that cut in front of Anna just before the accident). \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME \nAnna listens anxiously to the CRUNCH of Eliot's feet on the gravel outside. After a moment she hears the van drive away. She unfurls her fist revealing Eliot's keys. \nINT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. STREETS - MOMENTS LATER \nHe stands very still.    Watching.   Waiting.   We pull back. \nJUST AROUND THE CORNER Anna pushes herself against the wall clutching the knife. \nHALLWAY Eliot turns towards her... then at the last moment changes his mind. Heads in the opposite direction towards the viewing room. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nEliot steps carefully into the viewing room. Looks around. Just then we hear the sound of bare feet STAMPING along the hallway behind him. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME TIME \nAnna runs to the front door. It's locked. She glances around anxiously. Sees a staircase leading upstairs. She weakly stumbles up the stairs. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER \nAnna walks along the corridor. She peers into a room. Notices a TELEPHONE on a table. She moves over to the telephone. The door CREAKS closed behind her. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME TIME \nEliot hears the CREAKING DOOR upstairs.    He cocks his head upwards. Straining to listen. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nAnna frantically punches the buttons on the phone. \nINT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nA telephone RINGS in the empty kitchen. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME \nAnna rocks back and forth as she anxiously listens to the RINGING on the other end. \nANNA \n(DESPERATELY) Please pick up. Please pick up. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. STAIRS - SAME TIME \nEliot slowly climbs the stairs. \nINT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nThe phone continues to RING. We pull back. Paul stares at the phone blankly. A drink in his hand. He looks worse than before. Dark circles under his eyes. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME \nAnna glances back to the door in panic. \nANNA Paul.   Please pick up. \nINT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nFinally Paul reaches across and picks up the phone. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME \nAnna cups her hand around the mouthpiece. \nANNA \n(FRENZIED WHISPER) Paul. I'm here. \nINT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nANNA (O.S.) \n(RELIEVED) Oh God. \nPAUL Bad dream? \nANNA I was dead. I had a car accident.     Did you ever dream you were dead? Paul doesn't reply.    She turns... the bed's empty. \nANNA Paul? \nPAUL (O.C.) Yes? Anna looks up. Paul's in the doorway.    She gets up. Suddenly the light goes off. \nANNA Paul. The light comes back on.   Paul stands by the light switch. \nANNA What are you doing? \nPAUL (puts his finger to his lips) Ssh. Don't talk so loud. You'll wake the neighbors. \nAnna's getting nervous.    Something's not right. \nANNA What neighbors? You don't have any neighbors. Suddenly he looks at her reproachfully. \nPAUL Did you ever love me Anna? CLOSE ON Anna's face.    She looks away guiltily. \nPAUL (O.C.) Did you? Anna closes her eyes.    Unable to answer. \nPAUL (O.C.) Say it.     Say you love me. Suddenly we hear the strident ringing of a phone. \nANNA Aren't you going to pick it up? \nPAUL (O.C.) Me?   No.    It's probably for Eliot. Anna's eyes snap open in shock... \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEliot stands over her. We're back in the PREP ROOM.   We hear the faint ringing of a phone from upstairs. \nANNA Is it always like this? \nELIOT What do you mean? \nANNA I thought when you died you wouldn't feel anything. You wouldn't feel any more pain. You wouldn't have to struggle anymore. \n(BEAT) But it just doesn't stop does it? Upstairs the phone keeps on ringing. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nEliot takes notes as he talks on the phone. He looks at a day calendar on his desk. Idly flips over the page from Tuesday to Wednesday. \nELIOT No.   It's no problem at all. He glances at his watch. \nELIOT I'll pick up the deceased from the hospital. Yes. This afternoon? That'll be fine. It's my pleasure Mr. Merano. \nINT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - DAY \nGRAY BODIES lie on steel tables. Eliot moves over to one of the CORPSES. Examines it with professional interest. Just then the Old Guy walks in with the Pale Assistant pushing a gurney with a BODY wrapped in plastic sheeting. \nOLD GUY Well here he is. Frank Merano. The Old Guy hands Eliot a clipboard. The Assistant unties the rope. Pulls the plastic sheeting away. \nON BODY FRANK (40s), the top half of his head has been flattened. His head split open. Grotesquely distorting his face. \nASSISTANT (O.C.) Ouch.   That had to hurt. \nMORGUE Eliot glances at the Assistant with disdain. Signs the release form and hands the clipboard back to the Old Guy. \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - DAY \nPaul stands by a PRINCIPAL as they watch a JANITOR snap off the padlock on Anna's locker. \nPRINCIPAL \nELIOT I'm glad I could help. \nVINCENT Do you mind if I have a couple of minutes alone with him? Eliot hesitates.      Then smiles. \nELIOT No.   Not at all. I'll wait outside. As Eliot leaves, Vincent looks at Frank's body. After a moment he glances at Anna again. Then at the door. He quickly moves over to Anna. Looks at her curiously then pulls down the sheet. He reaches over... and CARESSES HER BREAST. Mesmerized by her naked body. As Vincent's hand moves down her body, he bumps against the trolley. Instruments CRASH to the floor. He pulls back the sheet just as Eliot enters the room. \nVINCENT I'm sorry.    I didn't see... \nEliot notices the sheet covering Anna's body is slightly askew. He reaches over and straightens it. Then looks coldly at Vincent. There's an uncomfortable silence. \nVINCENT Well. I guess I should be off then. I'll see you at the service. Thanks again. Vincent glances one last time at Anna then leaves. The door locking shut behind him. Eliot stares at the door. \nELIOT I just told you. That was your brother. (turns to Frank) You had an accident. You're dead. Why do you people never listen to me? Frank doesn't move.    His mouth still wired shut. \nELIOT No.   It's not a gift.   It's a curse. Eliot picks up a compact. Roughly layers Frank's cheeks with thick rouge. With every word he gets more agitated. \nELIOT I take care of each of you as if you were my children. I wash the shit from your bodies. I dress you. I do everything to make you look more beautiful than when you were alive. And what do you do? Eliot's extremely irritated now.     He grabs a garish red lipstick. Smears Frank's lips. \nELIOT You argue with me. As if it were my fault you're dead. As if I was to blame. (slams down the lipstick.) What? You're not talking to me now? You don't want to? \nON FRANK'S FACE The crudely drawn bright red lips.     Clown-like circles of rouge. Gaudy and macabre. \nELIOT (O.S.) You don't talk because you have nothing to say. And you have nothing to say because you're a corpse. \nPREP ROOM From Eliot's reaction it seems as if Frank has started to talk again. \nELIOT No. Now I don't want to talk to you anymore. \nINT. JACK'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nThe curtains are drawn. Jack's Mother, still motionless, in front of the blaring TV. Jack stops in the doorway. \nJACK I'm off to school now. His mother doesn't reply. Jack leaves. After a moment she slowly turns her head. Stares at the empty doorway. \nEXT. CEMETERY - LATER \nJack cycles through the cemetery. He pulls up by a bush. Stares at the Funeral Home in the distance. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThe service hasn't started yet. Jack walks nervously through the empty room to an open casket. He glances back, then leans over the coffin. \nJACK'S POV Frank Merano lies nestled in the velvet interior.    His face placid. No sign of the gaudy make-up. \nVIEWING ROOM Jack stares in fascination at Frank's body. He reaches into the casket. Touches Frank's cold hand. In the b.g. Eliot walks into the viewing room.     He stops surprised. Watches Jack intently. \nON JACK \nJACK \n(TO FRANK) What's it like? Are you afraid? \nELIOT (O.C.) Jack. \nVIEWING ROOM Jack turns quickly.    Eliot stands over him. \nELIOT You have empathy with the dead. You're drawn to them. Just as they're drawn to you. It's a rare gift. Jack can't look Eliot in the eye. \nELIOT I know you saw Anna. Jack hesitates.   Then nods his head. \nELIOT You're frightened by it. I was scared too the first time. But you shouldn't be. Christ had the same gift. He raised Lazarus and spoke to the dead. \nJACK \n(INTRIGUED) You spoke to Miss Bryant? \nELIOT Yes. \nON STORE WINDOW A RED-SLIP on a mannequin.       Just like ANNA'S RED SLIP. \nSTREET The light's turned green. The DRIVERS HONK angrily. Paul doesn't hear them. He places his hand against the plate glass. Stunned. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY \nEliot prunes a low hedge by the front door. \nPAUL (O.C.) Deane. Eliot turns.   Paul's clearly agitated. \nELIOT Mr. Conran.   A pleasure. Eliot stands stiffly.   Rubs his back. \nELIOT I love gardening, but I'm not sure gardening loves me anymore. \nPAUL She's not dead is she? \nELIOT \n(AMUSED) Mr. Conran. \nPAUL Someone saw her. \nELIOT I'm sorry? \nPAUL One of Anna's students. (nods towards the funeral home) In the window. \nELIOT Do you mean Jack? Paul's momentarily taken aback. \nPAUL You know him? \nELIOT Of course I know him. He's often round here. He seems to have a strange fascination with death. He's eleven years old Mr. Conran. And like all young boys has a vivid imagination. Now if you'll excuse me-- \nPAUL I don't think he imagined it.   I think he really saw her. \nELIOT Maybe you just want to believe he saw her. \nPAUL Fuck you. Paul pushes past Eliot and strides into the Funeral Home. \nELIOT Mr. Conran! \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nPaul moves quickly through the hallway. \nPAUL \n(SHOUTS) Anna! Eliot calmly heads towards Paul. \nELIOT Mr. Conran. I think you should leave before I call the police. Paul notices the stairs leading down to the Prep Room. \nPAUL What's down there? \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER \nPaul runs over to the Prep Room door. He grabs the handle. It's locked. Eliot appears behind him. Paul turns. \nPAUL She's in here isn't she?     Give me the key. Eliot stares at Paul with pity. \nPAUL Give me the fucking key. Paul turns back.   POUNDS the door in rage. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME \nThe POUNDING echoes through the room. Anna awkwardly sits up. Struggling with her emotions. She wants to call out but knows she has to let Paul go. \nPAUL (O.S.) Anna! \nAnna gets up.   Hesitates.   Weakly stumbles to the door. \nTOM \n(IRRITATED) So?   That's standard procedure. \nPAUL There was no EEG. Nothing. He could have drugged her to make it look like she was dead. \nTOM Drugged her?     Are you serious? Jeff looks up eagerly from his desk. \nJEFF There are drugs like that chief. Hydronium Bromide. Total paralysis within seconds. The heartbeat slows to almost nothing. Tom shoots Jeff a look. \nPAUL See? I'm telling you. She's not dead. The boy at school. Jack. He saw her. \nVINCENT (O.C.) I saw her. Paul turns hopefully. Finally someone believes him. Vincent Merano stands by Jeff's desk. \nVINCENT She was on the slab.     Dead. \nPAUL No! \nVINCENT I've seen dead bodies.       Believe me, she was definitely dead. \nPAUL Tom. Just go down there and check the place out. \nTOM On what grounds Paul?       Do you have any evidence? \nPAUL No.     But-- \nTOM Do you have anything? Paul hesitates.    We sense his uncertainty. \nPAUL I think she called me. \nTOM Called you? \nPAUL \n(WEAKLY) On the telephone. Jeff snickers. Paul's beginning to realize how absurd this all sounds. \nVINCENT Collect or long distance? Jeff snorts with laughter. \nTOM First you hit a fucking kid. Then you attack Deane. And now you're telling me your dead girlfriend called you? What the fuck's going on? You're loosing it Paul. Merano and Jeff shake their heads, looking at Paul as if he were crazy. Tom's voice softens. \nTOM I know you feel guilty but you've got to pull yourself together. Paul slumps in the chair.       Rubs his face. \nPAUL Maybe you're right.    But why won't he let me see her? Tom signals to Merano and Jeff. Merano walks back to his desk. Jeff turns back to his work. \nTOM Look Paul. The funeral's tomorrow. You'll see her then. It'll help. It will give you closure. Trust me. \nEXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe sun's low on the horizon. Eliot whistles softly to himself as he digs a grave. Working meticulously. Like everything else he does. Suddenly a SHADOW falls over Eliot. He calmly looks up. The sun's behind the figure. For a moment Eliot can't tell who it is. \nJACK You said you could teach me. Eliot smiles. Gestures to Jack to come inside the grave. Jack steps back. The grave terrifies him. \nELIOT It's only a hole in the ground.   I'm digging it for-- \nJACK Miss Bryant. \nELIOT Exactly.   For Anna.   She belongs here. \nJACK Because she's dead. \nELIOT No.   Because there's no life left in her. Jack carefully considers Eliot's words. \nELIOT Don't you see? I have no choice. I'm the only one who can see all these corpses. Wandering the earth aimlessly. All they do is piss and shit. Suffocating us with their stench. Doing nothing with their lives. Taking the air away from those who actually want to live. I have to bury them all. I have no choice. \n(BEAT) Now there's two of us. \nEliot holds up the shovel. Jack looks at him for a moment then reaches for the shovel. \n(QUIETLY) I wanted love. \nELIOT You had love. Paul loved you. \nANNA No. You don't understand. I was scared. I wanted to love but I didn't know how. I was... \n(BEAT) When I was a child... my mother. Anna struggles to pull together her thoughts. \nANNA When I was a child. I learnt that love. That when you love someone. You get hurt. So I learned not to love. That way no one could ever hurt me again. She looks down at the slab.     Touches the cold marble. \nANNA I was always pushing Paul away.      He thought I didn't love him. \nELIOT Did you? \nANNA He was the only one I ever loved. But I never told him that. And then he stopped loving me. Eliot stares at her intently.    Comes to a decision. \nELIOT What would you do if you had another chance? Anna's puzzled. Eliot goes to the door and unlocks it. Moonlight floods in from upstairs. Washing it with a cold light. Anna doesn't move. \nELIOT Well?   Isn't this what you wanted? Eliot holds out his hand.   Anna takes it hesitantly and rises from the slab. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT \nMist drifts through the cemetery. Anna stands in the driveway. Pale and ghoulish in her black funeral dress and shiny black shoes. She starts walking. \nEXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAnna approaches her mother's house.    Paul opens the door. He's not surprised to see her. Beatrice stands just behind him.     A black shawl over her head and arms. \nINT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nIn the candlelight we can see the house is full of OLD WOMEN. Their faces deeply lined. Wearing identical black shawls. They stare at Anna, whispering in different rhythms. Unintelligible words undulating like an ANCIENT PRAYER. \nINT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nPaul and Beatrice lead Anna to the bed. As she lies down we realize the bed is full of BLACK SOIL. Clouds of ugly flies hang in the air. BUZZING noisily. The Old Women surround Anna in a tight circle. Leaning over her. Making her feel claustrophobic. She can smell their rotting breath as their prayers grow LOUDER. Through the chaos of words we begin to make out... \nOLD WOMEN Spit it out. Anna doesn't understand. Then she feels something in her mouth. Growing. Gagging her. The Women are SCREAMING. \nOLD WOMEN Spit it out. Anna spits out... white maggots.     She gags again.   Closes her eyes. Shakes her head. \nANNA No. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT \nAnna's eyes snap open. She's still in the Prep Room. She steps back from the doorway. Terrified. \nELIOT I thought you were different. You all say you're scared of death. But the truth is you're more scared of life. Eliot switches off the lights. \nANNA (O.C.) I'm glad I'm dead. I'm glad it's over. \nEXT. ROAD BY FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT \nPaul sits in his car. Staring out at the Funeral Home as he nervously smokes a cigarette. The light in Eliot's room goes off. Paul waits for a moment. Then gets out of his car. Stubs out his cigarette. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER \nPaul treads carefully along the side of the Funeral Home. It's a full moon. The trees rustle ominously in the wind. Casting eerie shadows against the dark house. He finds a window. Tries to open it. It won't budge. Just then he hears a noise in the bushes. He crouches down quickly. Listens hard. Nothing. \nFROM THE BUSHES Someone watches Paul tentatively move to another window. \nFUNERAL HOME Paul strains to open the window when suddenly... he's caught in a circle of bright light. Paul turns quickly. A DARK FIGURE stands over him. Menacing. \nMAN'S VOICE What the fuck are you doing here? The Figure lowers the flashlight.   It's Tom. \nTOM I'm taking you home. \nEXT. JACK'S HOUSE. GARDEN - NIGHT \n(AMUSED) Mr. Conran. We're at a wake.      You should show more respect. \nPAUL I know she wasn't dead. \nELIOT Wasn't she? Eliot's suddenly tired of Paul's allegations. \nELIOT Mr. Conran. You come to my Funeral Home, making wild accusations. You have no idea what happens when someone dies. What happens to their body. What happens to their soul. \n(TAUNTING) You think Anna was alive after the accident? Maybe you're right. Paul's stunned. \nELIOT Maybe she's still alive. You obviously don't believe a word I say. So why don't you go and find out for yourself Mr. Conran. Find out whether she's alive or dead. Paul grabs Eliot by his lapels.   Shoves him against the wall. \nPAUL \n(LOUDLY) You twisted fuck. The room's SILENT. Everyone turns towards Paul.   Eliot whispers in Paul's ear. \nELIOT You don't have much time left. Father Graham puts his hand on Paul's arm. \nFATHER GRAHAM Please.   Paul. You're not well. Paul pushes his hand away. Eliot shakes his head sadly. Everyone looks at Paul with pity as he runs out. \nEXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nPaul sprints across the lawn to his car. \nINT. PAUL'S CAR - NIGHT \nPaul slips his key into the ignition.   His hand's shaking. \nEXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nEliot watches Paul's car ROAR OFF. \nINT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME \nWe can't see a thing. But we can hear Anna's SHORT SHALLOW GASPS. And the sound of her nails desperately SCRATCHING at the coffin lid. \nINT/EXT. PAUL'S CAR. ROAD - NIGHT \nPaul drives fast. Accelerating then quickly braking as he weaves through heavy traffic. He comes up behind a slow Tractor-Trailer. Hits the HORN. \nPAUL Come on.   Come on. He swerves into the middle of the road. There's a blind curve ahead... suddenly an SUV comes out of the corner. A bright white light sweeps through his car.     Paul's momentarily blinded. \nTHE SCREEN FLASHES TO WHITE. Paul opens his eyes. The ROAD'S EMPTY. No sign of any traffic. He's confused. The road was busy a moment ago. Just then flashing red and orange lights illuminate the car. Paul looks in his rear-view mirror. \nON REARVIEW MIRROR An AMBULANCE moves quickly towards him.     Blasts past. \nCAR Paul looks through the front windshield.     Nothing.   He frowns. Where did the ambulance go? \nUP AHEAD We see the Funeral Home.   Bone white in the moonlight. The cemetery next to it. \nEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nEliot's White Van sits by the side of the road. \nEXT. CEMETERY. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nPaul's car slams to a halt. He jumps out. In the distance the candles still burn on Anna's grave. \nEXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - MOMENTS LATER \nPaul grabs a shovel by the grave. Starts digging. Then the shovel clunks against wood. He kneels down. Scrapes away the earth from the coffin. Then pulls open the lid. Anna's eyes are WIDE OPEN.     Her fingernails torn and bloody. Paul grabs her shoulders. Pulls her out of the grave.      Her body slumps limply like a rag doll. \nPAUL Anna.   I'm here. Please God.     Anna. He desperately tries to revive her. But there's no life left in her. He's about to give up when... Anna's hand TWITCHES. Then after a moment she GASPS. Her eyes slowly focus on Paul. \nANNA Paul? \nPAUL Baby.   Thank God. Paul gently helps Anna to her feet.    She looks round. Dazed. Turns back to Paul. \n", "test1_input": "BEHIND ANNA'S BACK her hands clutch the large scissors. \nPREP ROOM Eliot opens a cabinet full of boxes of hair dye with photographs of smiling women. As he prepares the dye he looks across at Anna. She's staring at something behind him. Eliot turns. Sees the uncovered body of the Old Woman on the gurney. He quickly walks over. Carefully pulls the white sheet over the Old Woman. \nANNA Who is she? \nELIOT Mrs. Whitehall. He mixes the dye in a bowl as he moves over to Anna. \nELIOT You shouldn't be afraid of her.   The dead can't harm the dead. \nANNA \n(FORCEFULLY) But I'm not dead! Anna's hand suddenly FLIES UP...   she slashes at Eliot's face with the SCISSORS. The sharp edge misses his cheek by inches. Eliot drops the bowl. Stumbles back against the steel trolley. Instruments crash to the floor. Anna staggers to the door. Her legs weak. Her long lank hair falling over her eyes. She frantically wrenches at the door handle but it's locked. Eliot gets up. Slowly moves towards Anna. She turns. Raises the scissors. \nANNA Stay where you are. \nELIOT (holds out his hand) Give me the scissors. I only want to help you. \nANNA Don't come any closer.     I swear to God I'll kill you. Eliot walks right up to her.     His face now inches from hers. \nELIOT \n(CALMLY) Go ahead. Anna doesn't move. Eliot looks her steadily in the eye. He reaches for her hand. Slowly. Deliberately. He brings the scissors to his cheek. Then lets go of Anna's hand. \nCLOSE ON ELIOT'S FACE The sharp tip pushes into his skin. \nELIOT Go on. \nPREP ROOM For a moment we think she might do it.      But then she wavers. \nELIOT What are you waiting for? Anna's confidence falters. She slowly lowers her hand. The scissors fall onto the floor. Anna looks down defeated. Her breath labored. Suddenly she realizes... \nANNA I'm breathing! (raises her head) Look. I'm still alive! \nELIOT You think you're still alive because you're still attached to life. It's normal. You're just imagining you still have symptoms of life. She's not listening. Eliot takes a roll of paper towels. Kneels down, picks up the bowl of dye and mops up the mess. \nANNA Maybe I was in some kind of coma. The doctors made a mistake. They're always making mistakes. \nELIOT You died.   Everyone dies. \nANNA How can I be dead if we're talking? He stands up.    Sighs wearily. \nELIOT We're talking not because you're alive. But because I have a gift. \n(BEAT) I can talk to those between life and death. \nANNA Why? \nELIOT To help them make the transition. Anna's stunned. For the first time we sense a seed of doubt in her mind. \nANNA Is this what happens when you die? \nELIOT It depends on how you lived your life. \nANNA What do you mean? \nELIOT Not everyone needs my help. Some let go as soon as their body dies. Others don't let go until long after they're in the grave. \nANNA Am I a ghost? Is that why I'm here? \nELIOT You're here so I can bury you. Anna's silent. Trying to make sense of what she's just heard. Eliot takes her arm. Leads her to the slab. \nELIOT Come.    We've wasted enough time already. She lies down submissively. Suddenly very tired.       Eliot leans over her to apply what's left of the dye. \nANNA \n(WHISPERS) No.    Please. I don't want-- \n", "test1_true": "ANNA But I can breathe.     I must be alive. She weakly pushes him away. Anger flashes across Eliot's face, but just as quickly he controls it. \nELIOT You people. You all think that if you breathe, shit, piss you're alive. Anna doesn't know what to say. \nELIOT You clutch onto life as if your life was worth clutching onto. Was your life worth clutching onto Anna? Anna turns her head away.   Clearly he's struck a chord. \nELIOT Was it?   Maybe you died a long time ago. Eliot rips off his latex gloves.    Tosses them into a bin. \nELIOT I have to tell you I'm surprised you're still arguing with me. You don't have much time left. (gestures to the Old Women) Look. She's accepted her death. Her life has been examined. She has no more regrets. And now she's at peace. She used her time well. You still have so much to learn. \nANNA I have nothing to learn! \nELIOT Are you sure? Eliot stands in the doorway. He switches off the light. His body silhouetted by the light from the hallway. \nELIOT Your funeral's in three days. Soon you'll be enclosed in a coffin. Then buried in the ground. No-one will hear you then. No-one will talk to you there. The door clicks shut behind him. Anna doesn't move. Clearly unsettled by Eliot's words. After a moment she looks at the Old Woman. She moves over. Hesitantly pulls away the white sheet. Stares at the Old Woman curiously. Then tentatively touches her cheek. \nANNA Are you cold? \nShe takes the Old Woman's hand.      Strokes her paper-thin skin. \nANNA I'm so cold. Anna notices the Old Woman's plastic ankle tag. \nON PLASTIC ANKLE TAG Name: Carol Whitehall.     Sex: F.   DOB: 11.02.30. \nPREP ROOM \nANNA You had a long life. Anna turns back.   Studies the Old Woman's serene face. \nANNA You look so peaceful. \n(BEAT) Aren't you scared? Anna's eyes fill with tears. \nANNA I'm scared.    I'm so scared. \nINT. JACK'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJack lies in bed staring at the ceiling. On his bedside table an alarm clock reads 2.38AM. He looks across at an Anglepoise lamp in the corner of the room bent over an open shoebox. He gets up. Walks towards the muted light. The SMALL CHICK huddles in the shoebox. It looks dead even though it's eyes are open. Jack's about to reach into the box. Then changes his mind. He looks at the lamp. Switches it off. After a moment he switches it back on again. \nINT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nPaul stands motionless in the middle of the room. Staring blankly into space. The room feels empty and depressing. He suddenly looks around. Not quite sure why he came into the room in the first place. He moves over to a CD player. Mechanically switches it on. Music fills the room. He turns the volume higher. Then all the way up. The music's unbearably loud but Paul just stands there. Numb. \nON PAUL The music's strangely distorted now.        Almost silent.   As if we were inside Paul's head. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT \nAnna lies on the slab. Curled in a fetal position. O.S. we hear the UNNATURALLY LOUD metallic drip of a faulty faucet. Slow. Rhythmical. Anna opens her eyes. Stares at us. Terrified. Then she turns her head. The Old Woman sits on the other slab. Slowly brushing her tangled gray hair with a silver backed brush. Anna looks around anxiously. The room is strangely larger. The perspective not quite right. Certain objects look absurdly small or abnormally large. She notices a TINY DOOR. Half hidden by a steel trolley. The door's slightly ajar. Anna's surprised. The Old Woman shakes her head. Staring blindly at Anna with opaque eyes. Anna ignores her. Moves quickly to the tiny door. As she approaches, the door seems to grow to normal size. Then we realize it's Anna who has shrunk. The steel trolley now towers high above her. The massive instruments on the trolley look like menacing insects cast in surgical steel. She opens the door. Revealing a solid wall of DARKNESS. \nFROM INSIDE THE DARKNESS the small shape of Anna in the doorway. The huge dark space engulfs her. The only light comes from the Prep Room behind her. \nPREP ROOM Anna reaches forward. Her hand disappears into the thick blackness. She snatches her hand back. Scared. Then... ...a CHILD'S HAND darts out of the darkness. Grabs Anna's wrist. Pulling her in with surprising strength. Anna struggles to free herself. But the hand drags her deeper into the darkness. The door slams shut behind her. \nINT. DARKNESS \nAnna stands in the black empty space. \nGIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) I'm disappointed with you. An innocent looking YOUNG GIRL (6) materializes out of the blackness. She looks like a young Anna. \nANNA Who are you? \nThe Young Girl walks slowly towards Anna. \nGIRL You promised me so many things. \n(AMUSED) You don't recognize me? Anna shakes her head. \n", "test1_id": 2580, "test2_input": "TOM You didn't believe him did you? \nPAUL No.   Of course not. Tom's relieved. Paul turns back to the monitors.     The ghostly figure of a YOUNG FEMALE TEACHER drifts hypnotically across the screen. \nPAUL It's just... I'm having these... \nTOM What? \nPAUL Nothing.   Forget it. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY \nEliot leans over Frank's body on the slab. Rolling a ball of wax in his hands to warm it up. He gently moves Frank's head to one side. In the b.g. Anna lies on her slab watching Eliot work. \nANNA'S POV Frank stares back at her with open dull eyes. His face partially reconstructed with plaster of Paris. \nPREP ROOM Eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give Frank's face a more natural texture. Then picks up a piece of wire with a fishhook-like barb at each end. \nANNA (O.C.) What's that for? Eliot looks up surprised. Anna stands beside him.        He leans down. Peels back Frank's upper lip. \nELIOT His mouth.   To keep it closed. Eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back Frank's lower lip. He attaches the other barb into the lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. He picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs. \nELIOT Now his eyes. He inserts the caps into Frank's eyes. Pulls his eyelids over them. Glues the eyelids together. \nANNA Is this how you'll prepare my body? Eliot looks at her for a moment.   Smiles reassuringly. \nELIOT No. There's no need. I had to rebuild his face. You're still beautiful. \nANNA Does he have family? \nELIOT Yes.    A brother. He's coming in later. Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank's body. \nANNA My mother... She didn't cry did she? When she came to see me? \nELIOT (shakes his head) I'm sorry. \nANNA And Paul? \nELIOT It's not important anymore. \nANNA I need to know. \nELIOT \n(HESITATES) No.    He didn't cry. We see a brief flicker of pain in Anna's eyes. \nANNA I knew he wouldn't.     He always got upset when I cried.     He said crying never helped. Anna suddenly looks very weary. She leans heavily against the slab. As if she's about to fall. \nELIOT You should rest. He guides her back to the slab.    Helps her lie down. \nELIOT You're getting weaker.    It's almost time. Eliot strokes her hair tenderly.    She looks up at him. \nANNA Can I ask you something? \nELIOT Yes.   Of course. \nANNA Why do we die? A long beat. \nELIOT To make life important. Anna's fingers curl around his hand. Like a vulnerable child. Totally trusting in him. Eliot looks down at Anna sadly. We sense he's conflicted. Confused. Wavering. But then reluctantly he reaches for a SYRINGE filled with AMBER LIQUID on the steel trolley. He injects her gently in the neck. Watches over her for a moment. Then moves to the window. He picks up a window pole. Pulls the shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY \nEliot moves through the Funeral Home pulling heavy drapes over the windows and closing doors. It feels like a ritual. The once airy sunlit rooms are darker now. More ominous. Claustrophobic. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY \nCLOSE ON a stream of crystal blue water.    We pull back. Eliot picks up a white towel. Dries his hands. Deep in thought. He moves to his desk. Picks up a Polaroid. \n", "test2_true": "ELIOT (O.C.) Mrs. Whitehall. Susan. I hope you found what you were looking for. \nROOM Suddenly Eliot looks up sharply.   As if someone had spoken to him. \nELIOT Think nothing of it Mr. Houseman.    No need to apologize. Eliot moves over to the wall. \nELIOT I really enjoyed our time together. We pull back slowly. Eliot's talking to a POLAROID of an OLD MAN. We pull back further... the wall's covered in HUNDREDS OF POLAROIDS of BODIES in open coffins. Most of them have closed eyes but we glimpse some with their eyes wide open. Eerily staring at us. Eliot touches the Polaroid of a YOUNG MAN. We see the fear in the Young Man's eyes. \nELIOT (O.C.) Anthony.    Anthony. Always confused. Just then we hear the doorbell ringing downstairs.    Eliot moves to the window. \nELIOT'S POV A POLICE OFFICER stands at the front door.    A SQUAD CAR parked on the driveway. \nELIOT'S ROOM Eliot steps back.    Calmly continues to dry his hands. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - DAY \nEliot leads the Police Officer through the hallway. \nELIOT How can I help you Officer? \nOFFICER I'd like to see the body. \nEliot stops.   We see a brief flicker of unease in his eyes. \nOFFICER Frank Merano. I'm his brother.    Vincent Merano? I called this morning. \nELIOT Mr. Merano.   Yes. Of course. \nVINCENT (OFFICER) I hope it's no trouble. I'd just like to see him before the funeral. Eliot glances at his watch.   Smiles at Vincent. \nELIOT It's no trouble at all. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nEliot leads Vincent to Frank's covered body. Vincent looks over at Anna. The white sheet only comes to her shoulders, her head facing straight upwards. \nELIOT Your brother's here. Vincent turns back to Eliot. We're not sure if Eliot was speaking to Frank or to Vincent. Eliot pulls the sheet away. Frank's face is flawless. No sign of any damage. \nVINCENT He looks so peaceful. You've done a beautiful job. Thank-you. \nELIOT You should remember him as he used to be. Suddenly we hear a FAINT RUSTLING sound. Vincent glances again at Anna's body. Her head is now turned to one side. Wasn't she facing upwards a moment ago? Vincent's puzzled for a second then shrugs. Must have been his imagination. \nVINCENT That's the schoolteacher isn't it? Eliot pulls the sheet over Anna's face. \nELIOT \n(QUICKLY) Yes. Very tragic. Now is there anything else I can help you with? Vincent frowns.   Turns back to Eliot. \nVINCENT Something's not right here. \nELIOT (looks up sharply) Not right? Vincent nods towards Frank's body. \nVINCENT His smile.    It was a bit more... Vincent raises his fingers to his mouth, trying to find the right word. \nVINCENT ...smiley. \nELIOT Smiley. \nON FRANK'S MOUTH Eliot manipulates Frank's lips. \nVINCENT (O.C.) A touch more. \nPREP ROOM \nVINCENT That's much better. Thank-you. \n", "test2_id": 2581, "test3_input": "ANNA You lied to me. Eliot injects her in the side of the neck. Anna tries to raise her hand to push him away but she's too weak. \nELIOT (O.C.) You're still clutching onto life. Don't give in to your fears. You're so close. Anna's fading away.    Her hand drops limply to her side. \nANNA \n(WHISPERS) Why did you lie to me? She stops struggling.    Stares blankly at us. Eliot looks at her for   a moment. Sadly. Regretfully. He picks up a Polaroid   camera. The flash explodes in a blinding white light.    He pulls out the Polaroid. Peels off the front and fans   it in the air. Then... \nON ANNA ...delicately closes Anna's eyelids. \nELIOT (O.C.) Good bye Anna. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nAnna's funeral is in progress.   Eliot stands by her casket. Surrounded by wreathes of tulips and lilies. Beatrice, in her wheelchair, in the front row. Diane beside her. A SCHOOLTEACHER sits behind them with Jack and other CHILDREN. \nFATHER GRAHAM (O.C.) I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live. Tom and Paul appear at the door.   Tom guides Paul to a seat near the back. \nFATHER GRAHAM (O.C.) They that sleep in the earth will awake and shout for joy; and the earth will bring those long dead to birth again. \nON CASKET Anna lies in an open casket. Her eyes closed.     She can hear the DISTORTED VOICE of the Priest. \nFATHER GRAHAM (O.C.) We have come here today to remember before God our sister Anna. To give thanks for her life. \nON ANNA'S FACE We see an almost imperceptible frown. \nVIEWING ROOM Eliot gestures to Beatrice. Diane wheels her to the casket. Beatrice looks at Anna for a moment, then touches the violets in Anna's hands. \nDIANE Violets. They were her favorite flowers. (turns to Eliot) How did you know? \nELIOT Violets just seemed appropriate somehow. \nNext we see Mrs. Hutton at the casket. Then Jack. He stares at Anna's body before being moved on by the Schoolteacher. Finally Paul and Tom approach the coffin. \nPAUL'S POV Anna looks serene. \nVIEWING ROOM Paul takes out the ring box from his pocket. Gently slides the engagement ring onto Anna's stiff finger. Suddenly he looks alarmed. Turns quickly to Tom. \nTOM \n(WHISPERS) What is it? \nPAUL She's so cold. Paul turns back to Anna.    Tears prick his eyes. He touches her cheek again.    Finally accepting her death. \nPAUL I'm sorry Anna. He kisses her lips. Eliot watches him carefully. It's almost as if he's jealous. Jack notices Eliot's look then turns and stares at Paul. As Paul and Tom walk away Eliot closes the casket. Begins to screw down the lid. \nINT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME \nIt's dark. We hear the screws TIGHTENING.      Anna's eyes FLICKER OPEN then close again. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - SAME TIME \nJust then Paul turns back sharply.      As if he sensed Anna's reaction inside the casket.      Tom gently stops him. \nTOM (shakes his head) She's at peace now. Paul glances at the casket again, then reluctantly allows Tom to lead him away. Eliot tightens the last screw. His back to the room. Suddenly the screwdriver slips. Gashes his finger. \nON COFFIN A drop of blood falls onto the polished wood. \nVIEWING ROOM Eliot stares at the blood for a moment. Takes out a pristine white handkerchief. Carefully wipes off the blood. Then places his hand on the coffin. \nELIOT \n(SOFTLY) Don't be scared. It's better this way. Eliot turns.   Signals to the PALLBEARERS standing nearby. \nEXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe Pallbearers slowly lower Anna's casket into the open grave. The casket lurches as it settles in the grave. \n", "test3_true": "Anna's eyes SNAP OPEN in terror. She tries to scream out. But only a SOFT RATTLING WHISPER escapes from her throat. \nEXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - SAME TIME \nThe TEACHER throws a handful of earth onto the coffin. Jack steps up. Looks down curiously. As if he could sense Anna. Then slowly pours the soil from his hand. \nFATHER GRAHAM (O.C.) We have but a short time to live. Like a flower we blossom and then wither. In the midst of life we are in death. \nINT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME \nBlackness. Earth CLATTERS HEAVILY onto the wooden lid. Anna GASPS softly. Hyperventilating. The earth keeps falling. The sound becoming SOFTER with each shovelful. She struggles. Bangs her fists against the wood. \nEXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - LATER \nThe grave's covered with a stone slab now. Votive candles flicker on top. In the b.g. MOURNERS head to their cars. Paul and Tom stand by the grave. \nTOM You sure you're going to be OK? \nPAUL Yeah.   Thanks Tom. Tom squeezes Paul's shoulder then walks away. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - SAME TIME \nEliot carefully pins Anna's Polaroid to the wall. \nON POLAROIDS We pan slowly across the other photographs we saw before. But now we look at them differently. In some faces there is the glimmer of life. In some a despairing pleading look. In others passive resignation. \nELIOT'S ROOM Eliot moves towards the window. \nELIOT'S POV The dark cemetery. In the distance flickering candles illuminate Anna's grave. \nELIOT (O.C.) Imagine Anna. The whole world, your mother, your fianc\u00e9e, your friends. Everyone has buried you. They've placed a stone above your body. \nELIOT'S ROOM \nELIOT They've said their good byes and gone back to their TV dinners and shopping malls. Thinking that this is never going to happen to them. Until it's their turn to be buried. Think about it Anna... Eliot glances at his watch. \nELIOT ...think about it while you still can. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nPaul unlocks his car. He's about to open the car door when he feels someone watching him. He turns. Jack's observing him carefully. \nPAUL You said she was alive. \nJACK I never said she was alive.     I just said I saw her. Paul simply nods his head.        Too drained of emotion to react. \nPAUL You need a ride? Jack shakes his head. \nPAUL OK.   See you. Paul opens the car door. \nJACK Mr. Conran? \n(PAUL TURNS) Don't forget to fasten your seat belt. Paul nods. Gets in his car.        Jack looks up at the Funeral Home. \nJACK'S POV Eliot stands in the window smiling at him. \nINT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nWe're at Anna's wake.      PEOPLE talk quietly in small groups. Paul fills a glass with whiskey. Knocks it back in one. PEOPLE stare disapprovingly. WHISPERING to each other. \nELIOT (O.C.) Don't you think you've had enough to drink? Paul turns. Eliot stands beside him.        Paul pours himself another drink. \nPAUL Go to hell. An ELDERLY COUPLE shake their heads and walk away. \nELIOT \n", "test3_id": 2582}

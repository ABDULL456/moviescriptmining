{"test1_input": "JACK Yes.    It will be fun. \nThey reach Anna's car.    Stand in silence for a moment. \nANNA Jack. Those boys.    Do they bother you a lot? Jack hesitates.    Then slowly nods his head. \nANNA You know you can always talk to me about it if you want to. He nods.   Anna's clearly worried about him. \nANNA You sure you don't need a ride? Jack shakes his head.    Anna glances at her watch. \nANNA Well.   I better run. \nJACK Where are you going? \nANNA \n(HESITATES) I have to go to a funeral.   My old piano teacher. \nJACK (with sudden interest) Can I come? \nANNA No Jack.   Funerals are very private affairs. \nJACK I've never been to a funeral. \nANNA It wouldn't be appropriate Jack. Anyway wouldn't your mom worry about you? \nJACK \n(SHRUGS) Not really. \nANNA I'm sure she would. I'll see you tomorrow in class. Have a wonderful birthday. Jack nods disappointed.   Anna watches him walk away then gets in her car. \nINT. ANNA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER \nAnna slips her key into the ignition. Loud music suddenly blares from the car radio. She switches it off. Squeezes the bridge of her nose. She pulls out a bottle of pills from her bag. It's empty. She rummages in the glove compartment. Finds another bottle. Empty. She sighs. \nEXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER \nJack sits on the bench. Watches Anna drive away. Then unzips his backpack. Something moves inside. A strange jerky movement. Jack closes the backpack. Glances up and down the empty street. Then walks away on his own. \nEXT. STRIP MALL. PHARMACY - DAY \nAnna steps out of the Pharmacy. As she washes down a pill with a bottle of water she notices a small Hair Salon. Looks critically at herself in the Pharmacy window. Anna moves over to the Salon. Reaches for the door handle... then hesitates. She's about to walk away when the Salon door suddenly opens. Anna smiles shyly as a freshly COIFFURED WOMAN politely holds the door for her. \nINT. HAIR SALON - DAY \nAnna leans back against a washbasin.    Her neck tightly cradled against the white porcelain.    The light's harsh and not particularly flattering. She    closes her eyes. Behind her the HANDS of a HAIRDRESSER   in latex gloves begin to rinse dye from Anna's hair. \nON SINK Startling white. A stream of water flows into the sink. Then after a moment the spiralling clear water gradually turns a deep crimson red. \nINT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. HALLWAY - DAY \nAnna closes the front door behind her. She smiles as she catches her reflection in the hallway mirror. Her hair a dark vibrant red. Just then, from another room, we hear an OLD WOMAN'S hacking cough. \nOLD WOMAN (O.S.) Anna?   Is that you? \nANNA Yes Mother. \nINT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nAnna's mother, BEATRICE (50s), sits in bed, knitting with swift, violent precision. The bedside table's stacked with medication. She's clearly been bed-ridden for some time. An electric wheelchair in the corner of the room. Anna appears at the door. Beatrice scrutinizes her for a second. Then returns to her knitting. \nBEATRICE Terrible color. Anna moves to the beside table.   Picks up a dirty plate. \nANNA Can I get you something to eat? \nBEATRICE I'm not hungry. \n", "test1_true": "BEATRICE I don't have to do anything. \nANNA The doctor said-- \nBEATRICE The doctor's an idiot. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Anna sighs. Trying hard not to let her Mother provoke her. Beatrice glances up. Anna avoids her look. \nBEATRICE Why did you do it? Today of all days. \nANNA What have I done wrong this time? Anna goes to the window.   Draws back the curtains. \nBEATRICE You've forgotten haven't you? \nANNA No I haven't forgotten.   The service isn't till six. \nBEATRICE Then you've got plenty of time to wash it out. \nANNA It's permanent. You can't wash it out. \nBEATRICE Then dye it back. You can't show up at the funeral looking like that. Like some prostitute. \nANNA I don't look-- \nBEATRICE Don't argue with me. Why are you constantly arguing with me? Anna bites her tongue.    Heads to the door. \nBEATRICE Where are you going? \nANNA To do the washing up. \nBEATRICE The sheets need changing.    They haven't been changed in months. \nANNA I changed them Monday. Anna goes to the cupboard.    Takes out clean sheets. \nBEATRICE You weren't here Monday. You never sleep at home anymore. What if something happened to me in the middle of the night? \nANNA Nothing is going to happen to you. \nANYWAY DIANE-- \nBEATRICE \n(SNORTS) Fat lot of good she is. I wouldn't have to pay for a Nurse if my only daughter wasn't living in sin with that lawyer of hers. Doing God knows what. They always leave you in the end. You'll see. Just like your father-- \nANNA That's enough Mother! Anna dumps the sheets on the bed. As she turns to leave Beatrice's hand darts out and grabs Anna's wrist. \nBEATRICE That's it.     Go and cry to Paul. \nAnna pulls herself free.   Moves to the door. \nBEATRICE Go and bitch to Paul about your mean old mother. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY \nA warm intimate room. Peaceful. Rows of chairs filled with ELDERLY MOURNERS. Eliot stands respectfully beside a casket. FATHER GRAHAM (50s) reads at a lectern. \nFATHER GRAHAM We have entrusted our brother James Hutton to God's mercy in sure and... \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS \nAnna, in a black dress, walks quickly along the gravel driveway. She stops. Stares out over the cemetery. \nFATHER GRAHAM (O.S.) ...certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died and rose again for us. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nAnna slips into the back of the room. Eliot leads MRS. HUTTON (60s) to the body of her husband, JAMES HUTTON (70S), lying in the casket. Mrs. Hutton touches a bouquet of white roses by the casket. \n", "test1_id": 2580, "test2_input": "(WITHOUT TURNING) Anna was in a car accident last night. My daughter's dead. That's what happened. Paul stares at Beatrice's back in disbelief. \nPAUL A car crash?     When? Beatrice turns her wheelchair round to face Paul. \nBEATRICE \n(IRRITABLY) I don't know. \nDIANE They said it happened just before 8.30. \nPAUL But... we were at the restaurant... Beatrice glares at him.    She clearly blames him for Anna's death. \nBEATRICE You shouldn't have let her drive in that weather. Paul looks down guiltily at the flowers in his hand. \nPAUL No. She can't be dead.    There must be some mistake. \nBEATRICE There's no mistake. We just got back from the funeral home. Beatrice pushes a joystick on her wheelchair.   As she whirs past Paul she notices the flowers. \nBEATRICE \n(DRYLY) Flowers? How appropriate. Paul's not listening anymore.   Stunned. \nPAUL Why didn't you call me? \nBEATRICE You took her away from me.   I don't want you anywhere near her. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - DAY \nEliot turns on the taps.   Fills a copper kettle. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME \nSilence. O.S. a shuddering pipe bangs ominously. Anna opens her eyes abruptly as if waking from a deep sleep. She stares at us. Numb. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nCLOSE ON an exploding BLUE FLAME from a gas ring. We pull back. Eliot places a kettle on the ring. Then measures out exactly two spoons of tea from an ornate tin into a teapot. Meticulous in everything he does. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME \nCLOSE ON Anna's hand. Her fingers FLEX slightly. She pushes herself up awkwardly. Suddenly realizes something. She touches her wrist. Desperately searching for her pulse. Then frantically checks her neck. Panicking. She can't find her heartbeat. She stares at her hand. Then abruptly SLAMS it against the slab. Hard. She feels no pain. She does it again. Harder. Still nothing. \nANNA I must be in shock.     That's all.   It's just shock. She struggles to her feet. Stumbles groggily to the door. Tries the door handle. It's locked. She bangs on the door feebly. Then she hears something. She cocks her head. Follows the sound of Eliot's footsteps upstairs. \nANNA \n(HOARSE) Let me out! \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S OFFICE - DAY \nEliot's by his desk. Checking his appointment book. Whistling softly to himself. We can't hear Anna's cries. He pours a cup of tea. Adds a drop of milk. As he stirs his tea, he hears the sound of feet CRUNCHING on the gravel outside. He glances out the window. \nELIOT'S POV Paul stands in the middle of the driveway staring blankly at the Funeral Home. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nEliot steps out of the Funeral Home.     Heads towards Paul. \nELIOT Can I help you? Paul turns to him.   Pulled away from his thoughts. \nPAUL Mr. Deane? \nELIOT Yes. \nPAUL My name's Conran.      Paul Conran. Eliot smiles.    Holds out his hand. \nELIOT Of course. The lawyer. (off Paul's surprised look) It's a small town. In my line of work you get to know everyone eventually. As they shake, Eliot looks at Paul's hand strangely.    As if he senses something. \n", "test2_true": "ELIOT That's strange. She wasn't wearing an engagement ring. \nPAUL Well not quite fianc\u00e9e... \nELIOT I'm very sorry for your loss Mr. Conran. \nPAUL I'd like to see her. \nELIOT I'm afraid the viewing isn't until-- \nPAUL I'd need to see her now.    If that's possible. \nELIOT I'm sorry. It's not possible.     You're not family and-- \nPAUL Please.   It'd only take a minute. \nELIOT I understand. But-- \nPAUL \nNO.   YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME \nAnna suddenly hears Paul's loud voice outside. \nANNA \n(WEAKLY) Paul! I'm here! Paul! She frantically beats her fists against the door. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME \nPaul quickly controls his anger.    His eyes smart with tears. \nPAUL I tried to stop her.     She didn't hear me. Paul's voice breaks with emotion. He can't go on. Eliot gently takes him by the elbow. Leads him back to his car. \nELIOT Mr. Conran.  There really is nothing I can do. I'm so sorry. Paul looks defeated. He simply nods his head.     Eliot watches him get into his car and drive away. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - LATER \nAnna sits by the door in the darkness. Suddenly the room's flooded with light. Eliot walks in. Looks at Anna for a moment. She just stares back at him coldly. He heads over to the sink. \nANNA Who was that? \nELIOT No one. \nANNA No one? A long beat. \nELIOT It was Paul. \nANNA \n(CALMLY) I know. I heard you talking to him. Why didn't you let him see me? Eliot smiles. Amused she caught him out.   He continues washing his hands. \nELIOT Did you love him? Anna looks up sharply.   Eliot's clearly hit a nerve. \nANNA That's none of your business. Eliot shrugs.   Dries his hands on a white towel. \nANNA You weren't going to tell me Paul was here, were you? \nELIOT No. \nANNA Why not? \nELIOT Because it would only hurt you. You have to let go of the living. Just like they have to let go of you. \n", "test2_id": 2581, "test3_input": "ON STORE WINDOW A RED-SLIP on a mannequin.       Just like ANNA'S RED SLIP. \nSTREET The light's turned green. The DRIVERS HONK angrily. Paul doesn't hear them. He places his hand against the plate glass. Stunned. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY \nEliot prunes a low hedge by the front door. \nPAUL (O.C.) Deane. Eliot turns.   Paul's clearly agitated. \nELIOT Mr. Conran.   A pleasure. Eliot stands stiffly.   Rubs his back. \nELIOT I love gardening, but I'm not sure gardening loves me anymore. \nPAUL She's not dead is she? \nELIOT \n(AMUSED) Mr. Conran. \nPAUL Someone saw her. \nELIOT I'm sorry? \nPAUL One of Anna's students. (nods towards the funeral home) In the window. \nELIOT Do you mean Jack? Paul's momentarily taken aback. \nPAUL You know him? \nELIOT Of course I know him. He's often round here. He seems to have a strange fascination with death. He's eleven years old Mr. Conran. And like all young boys has a vivid imagination. Now if you'll excuse me-- \nPAUL I don't think he imagined it.   I think he really saw her. \nELIOT Maybe you just want to believe he saw her. \nPAUL Fuck you. Paul pushes past Eliot and strides into the Funeral Home. \nELIOT Mr. Conran! \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nPaul moves quickly through the hallway. \nPAUL \n(SHOUTS) Anna! Eliot calmly heads towards Paul. \nELIOT Mr. Conran. I think you should leave before I call the police. Paul notices the stairs leading down to the Prep Room. \nPAUL What's down there? \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER \nPaul runs over to the Prep Room door. He grabs the handle. It's locked. Eliot appears behind him. Paul turns. \nPAUL She's in here isn't she?     Give me the key. Eliot stares at Paul with pity. \nPAUL Give me the fucking key. Paul turns back.   POUNDS the door in rage. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME \nThe POUNDING echoes through the room. Anna awkwardly sits up. Struggling with her emotions. She wants to call out but knows she has to let Paul go. \nPAUL (O.S.) Anna! \nAnna gets up.   Hesitates.   Weakly stumbles to the door. \n", "test3_true": "PAUL I'm here Anna. \n(DESPERATE) I'm sorry. Please Anna. He places the palm of his hand against the door. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME \nAnna places her palm against the door. As if touching Paul's hand. A tear falls down her cheek. \nPAUL (O.S.) We'll be happy again. I promise. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SAME TIME \nPAUL I can't live without you. Eliot looks up at Paul with sudden interest. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME \nAnna shakes her head. Takes her hand away from the door. Walks back to her slab. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SAME TIME \nPAUL Anna! Eliot gently puts his hand on Paul's shoulder. \nELIOT Mr. Conran.   She's dead. Paul pushes him away. \nELIOT I know what you're going through. Denial's a natural part of grieving... \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME \nAnna lies down on the slab. Closes her eyes.     ELIOT'S VOICE seems far away now. Receding. \nELIOT (O.S.) ...but you've got to accept she's gone. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nPAUL She needs my help. Eliot looks at him for a moment. \nELIOT You can't help her anymore.    Believe me. \nINT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nAn open plan office. Paul weaves quickly through the rows of desks. He seems unbalanced. Manic. DETECTIVES cautiously watch Paul approach Tom sitting at his desk, his head bent over paperwork. \nPAUL I need you to issue a search warrant. Tom looks up.       He's shocked by Paul's appearance. \nPAUL \n(LOUDLY) I need a fucking search warrant.    Now are you going to help me or what? JEFF (20s) a Young Detective at a nearby desk stands. Tom nods to him. It's under control. \nTOM Paul.    Sit down. Paul hesitates for a second. \nTOM \n(FIRMLY) Sit.    Down. Paul sits.    Tom leans forward.    He's not amused. \nTOM Just what the hell do you think you're doing? I got a call from Eliot Deane. Are you out of your fucking mind? \nPAUL Anna's not dead Tom. He won't let me see her. He's keeping her there-- \nTOM Anna was in a car accident. Her car was wrecked Paul. Remember? It's downstairs. \nPAUL She's not dead. Tom calmly gets up. Moves to a filing cabinet.   Takes out a file. Hands it to Paul. \nTOM Here's the Coroner's report. Paul manically rifles through the file. \nPAUL Look. (shows file to Tom) The paramedics phoned it in. They only checked for eye dilation and pulse. The doctor signed the death certificate without even seeing her body. \n", "test3_id": 2582}

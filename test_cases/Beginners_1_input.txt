INT. HAL FIELDS HOME. 
A single daisy stands in a vase in an empty kitchen. 
INT. HAL'S BEDROOM 
OLIVER FIELDS clicks on the light to the closet. He looks at the rack of his parents' clothes. He begins to put some in a box marked "home", some in a box marked "thrift". 
INT. HAL'S BATHROOM 
Oliver enters the bathroom and flushes bottle after bottle of pills and liquids down the toilet. Next he struggles as he looks over the old toothbrush, hairbrush, all the bottles and tubes besides the sink. He stares for a beat, then throws them all away. 
INT/EXT. HAL'S TRASH AREA 
Oliver hauls trash outside, adding it to a very large pile of bags. An older Jack Russell Terrier, ARTHUR, follows him. 
INT. HAL'S OFFICE 
Oliver and Arthur sit on the office floor surrounded by papers, boxes, books and trash bags. He finds a photo of HAL FIELDS in an open Jean jacket, no shirt, it's attached to a personal ad application which he begins to read. 
CUT TO PAST 
EXT. LARGE EMPTY PARKING LOT NIGHT 
In the dark, OLIVER FIELDS has a tape recorder and microphone, he follows ANDY as he excitedly prepares, a group of friends looks on. 
ANDY Okay. Is it on? (recorder) 
OLIVER Yeah yeah.

(CONTINUED)

Andy quickly lights a rack of large fireworks, they shoot up into the night and explode - smoke - more explosions - everyone's laughing. Oliver looks up at the fireworks, recording the sounds, happy. 
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

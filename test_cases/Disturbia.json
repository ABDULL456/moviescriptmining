{"train": "DISTURBIA \nWritten by \nChristopher Landon \nRevised by \nCarl Ellsworth \nMarch 2006 \nOVER BLACK: \nKALE (V.O.) (tense) Do you think he sees us? \nJEFF (V.O.) No, he can't see us. But he feels us watching. \nFADE IN: \nDEEP BLUE WATER FILLS THE FRAME. \nAnd there... a few feet beneath the surface... something SHIMMERS in the sunlight. As ripples dissipate, we make out the shape of a bright yellow CRANKBAIT waiting patiently for its prey on the end of a 10-pound line. \nWe hold on this for another silent beat... then -- a huge BLACK BASS suddenly swoops into frame, circling the bait! \nON KALE BRECHT (17) AND HIS DAD, JEFF BRECHT (45) \nBoth startle at the sight. Kale, a clean-cut all-American kid, reflexively yanks back on his rod and reel. \nKALE Whoa, did you see that thing? \nKale anxiously winds the spool -- \nJEFF Settle down, slow it down... \nJeff lightly puts his hand on Kale's, slowing the cranking to a slight, steady pull as we WIDEN TO REVEAL them standing near the stern of their 16-foot BASSMASTER. We are... \n1   EXT. BISHOP LAKE - DAY                                           1 \nThe undisturbed beauty of nature serves as our backdrop as we MOVE CLOSER to Kale and Jeff, taking note of their t- shirts: Jeff's has a silkscreened cartoon rendition of a Bass wearing aviator goggles with mounted missiles on its fins. Beneath it, the slogan: \"Weapons of Bass Destruction.\" The fish on Kale's shirt wears a stock car uniform, a single word across the bottom: BASSCAR. \nAs Jeff steadies Kale's hand and pulls away: \nJEFF You don't want to scare him off. You've got his attention, now just play with him. Tease him a little. \n(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso \n1   CONTINUED:                                                          1 \nKale and Jeff watch the water in anxious silence... Kale inching the line back toward the boat. One more crank, then -- \nThe BLACK BASS suddenly ATTACKS THE LURE with a tremendous SLOSH OF HIS TAIL! \nKALE Holy shit! \nJEFF It's all you, Kale, keep cranking! \nKale cranks fast and furious.    But this is one fish that's going down fighting. \nKALE I need reinforcements! \nJeff moves in, grabs the rod and reel from behind Kale. \nJEFF Heave, laddie! \nThey PULL.    The rod curls under the weight. \nJEFF (CONT'D) (pirate accent) Give it all ya got, mate, or you're gonna lose him! \nKALE (laughing; pulling; struggling) Dad, your pirate -- impersonation -- sucks!! \nJEFF How would ya know, have ya ever met one? I doubt it -- \nThe BASS SLOSHES FURIOUSLY around the bait, now just a few feet from the boat! \nKALE He's freakin' pulling us in! \nJEFF (laughing) Never! No Brecht has ever -- lost a fight -- to a fish! \nThe BASS suddenly snaps free. The line goes limp. Jeff and Kale lose their balance, nearly falling backward. Then -- \n(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso \n1   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                     1 \nAll becomes silent save for Jeff and Kale's heavy breathing. Kale winds the empty line back to the boat, shoots a glance to Jeff, then throws the rod aside in mock disgust. Jeff takes a seat in the captain's chair. \nJEFF (CONT'D) Throw me a -- \nKale is already in the cooler. He throws Jeff a Coke.        Both sit in silence for a beat. Then -- \nJEFF (CONT'D) Hey, at least the weather's great... we're spending quality time together. \n13   CONTINUED:                                                      13 \nPARKER (CONT'D) a sixty-foot radius from this guy here. \nParker points to a big black box (the CENTRAL TRACKING UNIT) on the kitchen counter. \nPARKER (CONT'D) He's like a modem. He gets a constant signal from Mr. Bracelet that he sends through your phone line to the monitoring station downtown. So they know where you are, where you've been and what you're thinkin' 25/7. \nJULIE What if he accidentally goes beyond -- \nPARKER (anticipating; re: red light on bracelet) Red light flashes. Means you've got about ten seconds to get your butt back to green, or else -- \nKALE The execution squad shows up? \nPARKER And they don't bring blindfolds. It's also tamper proof and waterproof. So don't try sticking your foot in a bucket of water and hopping across the line. It won't work, and you'll look stupid. Now, I'll be checking up on you a lot. Here's my card -- You're set up to pay his incarceration fee, Ms. Brecht? \nJULIE Automatic withdrawal. (to Kale) Twelve bucks every day. \nPARKER (re: a booklet) Everything else is in the manual. (making her way out) Oh, except this -- House arrest might sound like a breeze, but trust me, I've seen all kinds of folks get a bit loopy before too long, some after just a day or two. So make sure you find lots of constructive things to keep yourself busy. \nD.J. Caruso \n14   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER                                14 \nKales sits in his video game chair, wearing his X-box live headset, playing HALO 2 -- he's on the final \"boss level.\" GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS BLARE over his stereo speakers. \nKALE (into headset as needed) Hobby, you read me? I said come around my left flank and draw his fire -- damn straight I'm trying to get you smoked, you've been hiding behind my ass the whole game -- \nThe TV SCREEN suddenly GLITCHES. \nKALE (CONT'D) Hobby, Jet, you guys still there? \nThe screen goes black. The XBOX LIVE LOGO APPEARS along with the words: SERVER ERROR. Kale throws the headset aside, makes sure all the wires are connected. Checks the TV screen. Same thing. \nKale glares at the screen another beat, then gets up, wanders out of his room... \n15   INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                               15 \nKale slowly heads down the stairs, rounds the corner into... \n16   INT. KALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                   16 \nKale runs into Julie who wears a black blouse and slacks, the required uniform of the steakhouse she works at. She's just thrown a couple of microwave dinners on the kitchen table. She's scrambling around, eating a couple bites, gathering her things... \nJULIE Dinner's on the table. I'm closing at the restaurant the next few nights. Could be some late ones, but hey... the extra tips couldn't hurt. \nKale sits at the table, picks through his food. \nJULIE (CONT'D) (glancing around) Where's my apron... apron... \nShe heads O.S. for a beat, comes back in with her apron and purse, sets them on the counter. Eyes her watch, sits at the table, takes a couple more quick bites. Then -- \n(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso \n16   CONTINUED:                                                             16 \nJULIE (CONT'D) You wanna talk about anything? \nKALE I got nothin'. \nJULIE Y'know, when we're finally free of all this legal stuff with the accident, the other families' lawyers... there might be a little insurance money left... maybe you should go back and see Dr. Phillips? \nKALE What, so he can tell me I'm ADD, have PTSD, and severe IAD? \nJULIE IAD? \nKALE (messing with bracelet) Freakin' irritated ankle disorder. \nJulie can't help but crack a little smile: \nJULIE Well, that one could've been avoided. \nKale looks back up. He's not smiling. Whatever chance we had of a lighter conversation panning out here quickly fizzles. Another beat, then -- Julie pushes her chair back, heads to the counter, grabs her apron and purse. \nJULIE (CONT'D) (heading out) Do the dishes. (pleading) Please? \nJulie leaves. Kale glances around the kitchen.       A mess of dirty dishes, stacks of paper... screw that. \n17   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER                                    17 \nKale, looking disheveled and very perplexed, now has his TV pulled out from the wall. He's behind it, meticulously checking and re-connecting all the wires and ethernet cable. Carefully studying the manual as he goes. \nHe blows on the Halo 2 CD, wipes it down with his sweatshirt, gently puts it in the tray, giving us the idea this might not be his first attempt at this. \n(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso \n17   CONTINUED:                                                           17 \nHe powers up the Xbox, grabs a controller... so far, so good... he scrolls through the screens, a little hope returning... SERVER ERROR. \nKale throws a mini-fit, slams the controller to the floor. Rips the controller cord out of the XBOX -- \n18   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING                               18 \nKALE (CONT'D) What are you, mental? \nJULIE (a very stern tone) One more look at that kitchen and I will be. \nJulie picks up her keys and briefcase, pecks Kale on the forehead, leaves. \nJULIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) You heard what I said about the lawyer? \nKALE Yes! \n25   INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY - LATER                                    25 \nKale furiously stuffs clothes in the washer, blindly cranks the knob, presses start. \n26   INT. KITCHEN - DAY - LATER                                         26 \nKale SHOVELS dishes and glasses into the dishwasher, breaking a couple as he goes. He pours half the box of Cascade in the dispenser, kicks the door up and closed, cranks the knob. \n27   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER                                  27 \nKale sits on his bed, staring into space. He eyes the clock. Tick tick tick... We hear KIDS PLAYING IN THE STREET O.S. \nKale glances out the window. \nHIS POV - Kids on bikes, NEIGHBORS out on walks... ahh... the sights and sounds of summer... And Kale's not invited. He glares down at his ankle bracelet. It glares back. \n28   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER                                  28 \nKale sits on the floor as he spreads a line of Elmer's glue across the bottom of a Twinkie. He's just completed the first couple of floors of what will be... TWINKIE TOWER. \n29   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY                                          29 \nKale, on cell, sits in his video game chair painting his toe nails. \nKALE (into phone as needed) Dammit, Ronnie, I'm losing my mind. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso \n29   CONTINUED:                                                           29 \nKALE (CONT'D) Give me some details, what's happening out there? \nRONNIE (V.O.) (phone filter; party sounds in the b.g.) Dude, the chicks here in Oahu rock the houusse! Oh my god, this one is totally showing me her kite board. Belay that, she wasn't pointing at me. Look, Kale, I've gotta hop -- \nKALE Wait, Ronnie -- Hello? \nKale tosses the phone and the nail polish aside. Sits there in silence for a beat. Then eyes a racketball on the floor. Picks it up. Starts mindlessly bouncing it against the wall... and keeps bouncing it... and keeps bouncing it... \nHARD CUT TO: \n30   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER                                    30 \nKale reclines in his chair, now FURIOUSLY SWATTING the racketball against the wall -- with a racket. We PULL BACK to reveal SCUFF MARKS on the walls and CEILING where Kale has figured out the exact points to hit it allowing him to bounce the ball off multiple walls and return it perfectly to his hand. He SWATS it... and SWATS it... \n31   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - STILL LATER                              31 \nKale's passed out in his chair, the racket still in his hand. He's about to fall out of the chair when a loud BANG O.S. JOLTS him awake. \n32   INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY/WINDOW - DAY - SECONDS LATER                  32 \nKale goes to the window, tilts his head, trying to see where the noise is coming from. \nKALE'S POV - He's able to make out some bits of movement next door, but his VIEW is OBSTRUCTED by the architecture of his house. \nKale steps back from the window, studies it a beat -- then opens it, slowly sticks his head out. \nHIS   POV - A U-HAUL TRUCK comes into view. It's backed into the   driveway next door. ALAN NORRIS, 43, appears from inside the   truck's cab, carrying a moving box. He hands it down to his   wife, BONNIE, 42, who walks back in the house. \n(CONTINUED)     D.J. Caruso \n32   CONTINUED:                                                             32 \nKale's about to pull his head in when another PERSON comes out of the moving truck. She's carrying a box that's obscuring her face as she carefully negotiates the incline of the moving truck's ramp. \nBut her blonde hair and perfect legs look to be about 17. We'll soon know her as ASHLEY, the Norris' daughter. \nShe reaches the end of the ramp. Bends over to retrieve another smaller box, her back and ass to Kale who stares in utter disbelief. Ashley stacks the boxes, picks them up and heads into the house, her face still a mystery. \nKale watches her go.   Mesmerized. Suddenly, the DOORBELL RINGS O.S. Kale snaps to, yanks his head back in -- and KERBONGS it on the underside of the window. He drops to the floor. \nKALE GODDAMMIT! \nKale staggers to his feet... \n33   INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY - SECONDS LATER                                  33 \nMore doorbell RINGING.       Kale heads down the stairs to the front door. \nKALE I'm coming!! \nKale swings the door open to see -- A BURNING PAPER BAG on the welcome mat. \n34   EXT. KALE'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS                     34 \n48   EXT. KALE'S FRONT YARD - THE NEXT DAY                             48 \nON KALE - now clean-shaven, sitting on the front steps. He eyes his watch, then stretches his neck. Yawns. Then he sees something O.S. \n(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso \n48   CONTINUED:                                                          48 \nKALE'S POV - peering down the street, Ashley's stationwagon rounds the corner -- \nKale hops to his feet, quickly fixes his hair as the stationwagon draws closer. \nKale casually strides into the yard, approaching the kite string boundary and mailbox. Then -- keeping his feet planted in what looks to be a very practiced maneuver, he suddenly falls forward against the mailbox. Reaches around with his free hand, opens the door, going to grab the mail inside just as \nASHLEY \npulls the car into and up the drive.    She glances at Kale who nods and smiles back. \nAs the stationwagon heads up the driveway, Kale tries to push himself upright -- but his feet SLIP. He pitches forward more. He glances back over his shoulder, sees Ashley getting out of the car and looking his way. Kale struggles under his own weight, trying to keep his feet from crossing the line -- he looks back to Ashley who's now heading toward him. A slight smile crosses Kale's face as -- \nASHLEY Can I help you? \nKALE Nope, no I'm fine. \nASHLEY (helping him up) Too late. \nKALE Thanks, that was really humiliating. \nAshley reaches in the box, grabs the mail, hands it over. \nASHLEY Please. I think any pride you had left was gone a while ago. \nKALE Oh, you mean that thing with the cops? They had the wrong guy, total foul up. I'm Kale by the way. \nAshley nods with a semi-polite smile, starts to head away -- \nKALE (CONT'D) Hey, so -- how'd the move go? \n(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso \n48   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 48 \nASHLEY Still going. \nKALE I'd help, but... (re: ankle bracelet) I'm a little spatially challenged at the moment. \nAshley walks closer to Kale, checks out his ankle bracelet. \nASHLEY Yeah, you've kinda got the whole Martha Stewart thing going on -- \nKALE (nodding) But minus the 48-hour allowance for office visits. And no lame \"Apprentice\" spin-off. (off her laugh) So where'd you move from? \nASHLEY I'm a city girl. Born, raised, and now... (glances around; sighs) Forcefully relocated. \nKALE That doesn't sound good. \nASHLEY I'm telling you, if I have another clueless jock hit on me or one more soccer mom cuts me off in her oversize SUV, I'm gonna go postal. \nKALE Oh, sorry, I was just gonna see if you wanted to hop in my Hummer and cruise to a kegger. (turning away) Nice talking to you. \nASHLEY (cracking a smile) Wait, I -- \nBONNIE (O.S.) (from inside house) Ashley? Can you come in here, please? \n(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso \n48   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                  48 \nASHLEY (quietly to Kale) My mom -- she's very polite, always says \"please\" but she's got that tone, did you notice? \nKALE I know the tone. \nASHLEY (heading away) Oh, I'm Ashley -- \nKALE Noticed that, too. \nAshley smiles, disappears inside.    Kale's in love. \n49   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                           49 \nThe wind HOWLS outside. Kale sits on the couch flipping channels. Julie's in the chair, nodding off. \nON THE TV - Kale lands on that same photo of PATRICIA WALSH, the MISSING REDHEAD we saw earlier. \nNEWS ANCHOR (ON TV) ...attended a friend's birthday party at a local nightclub before she was last seen alone at a diner outside Madison, 50 miles east of here. A waitress said Ms. Walsh was picked up around 10:30 P.M. by an unidentified person driving a black 1960's era Mustang that was dented on the left side and may have -- \nKale CLICKS the TV off -- looks over to Julie who's now sound asleep. Kale's watch ALARM suddenly BEEPS. He quickly shuts it off, eyes Julie. She stirs but doesn't wake up. \nKale quietly gets up, grabs the blanket off the sofa, covers Julie up. He then picks up his soda and bowl of popcorn from the coffee table, heads away... \n50   INT. DAD'S OFFICE - NIGHT - SECONDS LATER                          50 \nKale, immersed in shadow, enters. He quietly pulls Dad's leather chair toward the window, positions it just right, and sits. \nBINOCULAR POV - Ashley sits on the roof leaning against her closed window. She's reading Lolita. \nRONNIE (O.S.) So you don't know what year the Mustang is? \nREVEAL RONNIE - sitting at dad's computer looking at the FBI'S OFFICIAL WEBSITE. \nKALE (now flipping through magazine) '65 or '66, couldn't tell. \nRONNIE Check this out. The feds think your missing girl might be related to three murders in Austin. All redheads. \nKale processes that as we suddenly hear a car door SLAM O.S. \nBINOCULAR POV - Kale TILTS DOWN to see Ashley's mom backing out the driveway. Kale TILTS UP to Ashley's window -- Ashley ducks back inside her room, disappears. \nKALE Movement. \n(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso \n53   CONTINUED:                                                        53 \nBINOCULAR POV - Kale TILTS DOWN to the pool, sees Ashley emerging from the house with a towel that she throws on the lounge chair. \nKALE (CONT'D) Better late than never. \nRonnie joins Kale at the window. \nTHEIR POV - Ashley flips her sandals off one at a time, pulls her tank off revealing her bronzed back and bikini top. \nRONNIE Dude... \nAshley slinks out of her shorts revealing a \"near-thong\" bikini this time. \nRONNIE (CONT'D) DUDE!! \nKALE (re: bikini) That's definitely new. \nAshley crouches down, runs her fingers through the water. \nRONNIE Oh, it's so warm, baby... \nAshley cups her hands, scoops a handful of water from the pool, splashes her face... runs her hands through her hair... She stands, takes a deep breath, holds it -- then exhales... \nRONNIE (CONT'D) Cleansing breath... \nAshley stretches her arms high above her head. \nRONNIE (CONT'D) Concentrate now. This is for the gold. \nRonnie grabs the binoculars from Kale, puts them to his eyes, moves closer to the window -- but his zoomed-in vision causes him to underestimate the distance -- THWUMP. The end of the binoculars HIT THE WINDOW just as Ashley dives into the pool -- Ronnie and Kale hit the deck as we hear the splash O.S. \nKALE Jackass! \nRONNIE Dude, there's no way she heard that. \n(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso \n53   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                      53 \nKALE Dick, my deaf aunt in Omaha heard that. \nKale grabs the binoculars from Ronnie. \nBINOCULAR POV - Ashley's underwater at the far end of the pool. She tucks and pushes off the wall, swims back... \nRONNIE (peering out) She's got great lung capacity. \nON ASHLEY - She suddenly surfaces, hoists herself from the water. She spins and sits on the ledge, rings the water from her hair. But she suddenly stops -- and shifts her GAZE UP toward Kale and Ronnie! \nKALE (pulling Ronnie down) I think she saw me -- \nRONNIE There's no way -- \nRonnie grabs the binoculars back. \nRONNIE (CONT'D) (re: Ashley O.S.) Okay, maybe she did. \nKALE Seriously? \nKale peeks out -- \nTHEIR POV - Ashley's slipping back into her shorts and tank top. She heads to the back door, tries the knob. Locked. Over this, Ronnie turns to Kale: \nRONNIE Her swims always that short? \nKALE (growing concern) No, she usually takes her time -- \nThey turn back.     Ashley's gone. \nRONNIE Now where is she? \nThe DOORBELL RINGS.       Kale and Ronnie freeze.   Then -- \n(CONTINUED)     D.J. Caruso \nAshley picks up the binoculars from the window sill, peers outside. \nASHLEY (CONT'D) Anything interesting out there? \nKale and Ronnie trade looks. Ashley turns around, binoculars still raised, aiming them like a gun at Kale. \nASHLEY (CONT'D) Are you spying on the neighbors, Kale? \nKale freezes. \nRONNIE (stepping in) Actually, he is. \nKale's eyes widen in panic. \nRONNIE (CONT'D) See, he has this neighbor -- who I guess by definition would also be your neighbor -- who may, in point of fact, be a cold-blooded killer. \nASHLEY Is that so. \nRonnie points out the window to Giles' house. \nRONNIE Exhibit A, Robert Giles. \n(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso \n55   CONTINUED:                                                           55 \nASHLEY Yeah, I've seen him.   So? \nKALE So you hear about that missing girl from Madison? \nASHLEY (realizing; then pointing out to Giles') What, you think he -- \nKALE He drives a car like the one she was seen in. \nRONNIE Black Mustang. \nKALE 60's era Mustang. \nASHLEY Gee, that really narrows it down. \nKALE They said it was dented.     His has a bashed-in fender. \nASHLEY (re: binoculars) So this is why -- you're -- \nSuddenly seeing something O.S., Kale RIPS the binoculars out of Ashley's hand, goes to the window. \nRONNIE What? \nBINOCULAR POV - Giles pulls the Silver Toyota out of the garage and out the driveway. \nAshley suddenly grabs the binoculars from Kale, peers out. \nKALE Hey -- \nASHLEY So that's the infamous black mustang, huh? \nKALE Yeah -- \n(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso \n55   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                   55 \nASHLEY The one with no dent? \nKALE (grabbing the binocs) What? \nBINOCULAR POV - Sure enough, the Mustang NO LONGER HAS A BASHED-IN FENDER. The garage door starts to close -- \nKALE (CONT'D) How'd he fix it so fast -- \nASHLEY Because it was never there in the first place? \nKale eyes Ashley. Shit, could he have imagined it?       Ashley playfully grabs the binoculars back from Kale. \nBINOCULAR POV - Ashley catches a glimpse of a faded TEXAS LONGHORNS BUMPER STICKER. \nASHLEY (CONT'D) Sorry guys, no bashed-in fender, just a Longhorns bumper sticker. \nKALE (grabbing the binocs) You serious? (then to Ronnie) She's right. \nTHEIR POV - Giles' garage door finally SLAMS CLOSED. \nKALE (CONT'D) (off Ashley's questioning look) They think it might be linked to some murders in Texas two years ago. \nRONNIE Austin, Texas. Texas Longhorns. \nKale and Ronnie eye Ashley as if to say \"see?\"      Ashley eyes them another beat -- then: \nASHLEY Okay, fine, stakeout. (grabs binoculars) Who's on my shift? \nOff Kale and Ronnie, their dreams realized -- \nD.J. Caruso \n(CONTINUED)       D.J. Caruso \n57   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                    57 \nASHLEY Something like that. (eyeing the bracelet) So... what're your issues, Kale? \nKale hesitates. We see in his eyes that he's flashing to the past... \"going there...\" There's an uneasy beat as Ashley picks up on it: \nThen -- HEADLIGHTS APPEAR OUTSIDE. Kale quickly turns away from Ashley, pulls one of the DV Cams off its tri-pod, flips out the three-inch LCD SCREEN. \nKALE That's him. \nDV CAM POV - Giles' silver Toyota pulls in the driveway. Stops. Engine and headlights turn off. \nASHLEY Another car -- \nDV CAM POV - Kale ZOOMS IN. The GRAINY IMAGE finally steadies to reveal a SECOND CAR pulling in behind Giles. A thirty- something attractive WOMAN -- a REDHEAD -- is at the wheel. She pulls in next to Giles' car. \nASHLEY (CONT'D) You seen her before? \nKALE No. \nDV CAM POV - Giles gets out.      Wearing a suit, no tie. \nASHLEY (re: Giles) Cute for a killer. \nGiles goes to the woman's car, opens her door. \nASHLEY (CONT'D) Who said chivalry's dead? \nThe woman gets out, wearing a black cocktail dress. \nASHLEY (CONT'D) There's a club girl for you. \nKALE How do you know? \n(CONTINUED)    D.J.

Sure enough, she's wearing both a green and a purple bracelet, and has a black stamp blotch on her hand. \nKALE (over the above) Missing girl was seen at a club. Didn't say which one though... (then aside to Ashley) Your I.D. must be pretty good. \nASHLEY (with a smile) I don't need one. \nThey turn back to the window, watch as Giles escorts the woman to the house, shows her in. A light comes on inside. \nDV CAM POV - Kale ZOOMS IN on one of the living room windows, spots the woman moving around inside, looking at artwork... she sits on the sofa as Giles enters with two glasses and a bottle of wine. He sits down, pours the wine. They toast, take sips. Giles moves in for a kiss -- \nKALE He's going in. \nDV CAM POV - The woman shies away from Giles, stands from the sofa. \nASHLEY Denied... \nThey watch as the woman gets up, moves to the center of the room, and starts to get a little groove on... \nASHLEY (CONT'D) (been there, done that) Oh no, he put on music... \nDV CAM POV - Giles watches the woman as she seductively moves her body to the music we're not hearing. \nASHLEY (CONT'D) Oh, c'mon, Giles, all she wants to do is dance. \n(CONTINUED)   D.J.

See if you can find the station. \nKale sets the camera down, turns on his receiver. As he toggles through radio stations -- Rock, Alternative... \nASHLEY (CONT'D) (watching the woman & Giles) No... no... \nKale flips to an easy listening R & B station playing Lou Rawls \"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine.\" \nASHLEY (CONT'D) Stop. \nBINOCULAR POV - Ashley watches as Giles takes the woman's hand and dances with her. Their rhythm fits the music perfectly. \nON RONNIE - he stirs on the bed, still asleep. \nRONNIE (eyes closed; grinning re: music) Hmmm... \nAshley and Kale eye Ronnie for a beat.     Then turn back to the window. \nDV CAM POV - Kale pans back to the woman and Giles. They're really dancing close now. Kale's and Ashley's eyes shift to each other, then quickly flick away. A beat. Then -- Ashley raises the binoculars, faces back toward Giles' with: \nASHLEY Now's the time to bust your move. \nGILES You're in no condition -- \nWOMAN Give me my keys. \nGILES Sorry. \nASHLEY'S POV - She sees Giles make a motion toward the fence. Suddenly, the woman's CAR KEYS WHACK the other side of the fence, then PLOP DOWN underneath it just a couple of feet from Ashley's position! \nON ASHLEY - she startles, looks over, sees the keys. \nASHLEY'S POV - She looks back toward Giles and the woman. Hears the woman start to LAUGH. Giles, not laughing, purposefully steps toward the woman, takes her arm. \nGILES (CONT'D) C'mon... \n(CONTINUED)   D.J.

Giles helps her back toward the house. \nWITH KALE - He's seeing it all. \nKALE (whispering) Ashley, come on... \nWITH ASHLEY - she glances down, eyes the car keys sparkling in the moonlight. She scoots toward them as -- \nWE CRANE UP TO REVEAL - Giles - heading back toward the fence! \nON KALE - seeing this. \nKale tries to get Ashley's attention, but she's not looking -- \nCU - ASHLEY'S HAND - she reaches for the car keys -- \nCLOSER - ASHLEY'S FINGERTIPS barely TOUCH them when -- \nGILES' HAND - suddenly SWOOPS IN from O.S., BRUSHES ASHLEY'S FINGERS just before grabbing the keys and swiping them back to his side! \nSomehow Ashley keeps herself from screaming as she YANKS HER HAND BACK, PRESSES HERSELF AGAINST THE FENCE. She puts her hand over her mouth to silence her own breathing -- \nKALE'S POV - Giles stands frozen in the shadows behind Ashley. \nWITH ASHLEY - She slowly turns her head, sees Giles through one of the cracks -- STANDING RIGHT THERE. \nAshley starts to slowly SLIIIDE away... when suddenly -- a TWIG SNAPS under her foot! Ashley FREEZES. She peers back through the nearest crack. \nASHLEY'S POV - searching for Giles -- doesn't see him -- \nAshley presses herself even harder against the fence as we... \nTILT UP AND PAN OVER TO REVEAL GILES - peering over the fence. We can only hope it's tall enough to keep him from looking down and seeing Ashley. \nWITH KALE - He's seeing it all. \nON GILES - He raises up, standing on his tip toes to get a better look down. Shifting his head back and forth. \nWITH KALE - He ducks behind the shrub, contemplating his next move. He glances down, picks up a large pebble. He pops out and tosses it over into Giles' yard. \n(CONTINUED)    D.J.

He then peers back out -- \nHIS POV - Giles lowers back down, turns and heads back toward the house. \nKale sighs in relief. Waves Ashley the \"all clear.\" Ashley heads back over to Kale, breathless. \nASHLEY (oddly exhilarated) That was intense. \nKALE Are you nuts?! \nAshley silences Kale with a finger to his lips. She then leans in, gives him a peck on the cheek and bolts away -- Off Kale, utterly stupefied -- \n59   INT. DAD'S OFFICE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER                          59 \nExhilarated, Kale SLAMS through the office door, binoculars in hand.

The wind picks up outside as we PAN TO REVEAL Kale asleep in the leather chair. \nWe suddenly hear GLASS SHATTER O.S. \nKale's eyes POP OPEN. He looks around. Did he hear something or did he dream it -- he pulls himself out of the chair, makes his way to the door, slowly swings it open... \n61   INT. 2ND FL HALL OUTSIDE DAD'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS         61 \n(CONTINUED)   D.J.

He delivers it to Giles as Julie brings the coffee, sits at the table. \nGILES (CONT'D) Thanks, man. \nKale turns to leave again. \nGILES (CONT'D) Oh, hey, Kale... (as Kale turns back) Nice to finally meet you. \nOff Kale -- \nASHLEY (V.O.) (prelap) Oooh. That's creepy. \n66   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER                                    66 \nAshley sits on the bed. She looks damned good, too.        Dolled up, lipstick. She's just heard the story from Kale. \nKALE I know, he's a total freak, right? \nASHLEY And very vague... did he genuinely mean it was nice meeting you or was he sending you a \"sinister message?\" \nKALE Are you messing with me? \nASHLEY Maybe a little. Did you even notice my hair? \nKALE So you think it's all a coincidence. We've got the car -- \nASHLEY With the non dent dent -- \nKALE The bumper sticker, the argument, the staring contest -- And now he's showing up in my kitchen -- \nASHLEY Why, because he slashed your mom's tire? \n(CONTINUED)    D.J.

Nobody moves after a night like that. \nKALE Well what if she's really \"not moving?\" What if she's tied in the dungeon with the other girl, starving to death -- \nASHLEY (getting up) Then come up with a rescue plan and get back to me. \nKALE You're leaving? \nASHLEY Have to.    Party. \nKALE Whose? \nASHLEY Uh, mine? \nKALE How is that possible? \nASHLEY Excuse me? \nKALE Well, I mean... Sorry, I just didn't think you knew anybody -- \nASHLEY I don't, I didn't -- (off Kale's confusion) I met this girl earlier, Minnie Tyco? \nKALE Oh my god, \"Skinny Psycho?!\" I sat next to that bitch in Spanish -- \n(CONTINUED)   D.J.

So I figured I can either shut myself in and keep hating it or... try to make the most of it. \nKALE Hey, I get it. You don't have to explain. \nASHLEY Kale, you're welcome to come, but -- \nKale looks at Ashley, realizes what she's referring to as he glances down to the ankle bracelet. \nKALE (with attitude) Well, I appreciate the thought. Really. \nASHLEY (returning the tude) Glad to hear it. \nAshley turns to leave. \nKALE It's funny, though. \nKale stands there, frozen as the two BRATS jump from the bushes, AD LIB MOCKING Kale as they laugh and race away into the shadows. Kale's about to pursue when the sound of a DOOR OPENING O.S. stops him cold.

He stands in her way. \nASHLEY (peering out the window as if shocked by something) Oh my God -- \nKale falls for it. He looks. Ashley shoves him out of the way, grabs the I-pod.

Wait, that's wrong. According to you, I'm trying to conform -- \nKALE Coulda fooled me. \nASHLEY What does that mean? \nKALE Forget -- \nASHLEY No, I'm not gonna forget it. \nKALE You wanna blend in with that crowd, fine, then stop looking up and trying to get a rise outta me. \nASHLEY (realizing) So you were watching me. Question is for how long? Just tonight?    Or maybe a week? Two weeks?

What else have you seen? \nKALE What else have I seen? \nASHLEY Yeah.   What else? \nKALE Okay -- I've seen how you always pull your kleenex from the box in groups of three. Not two, not four, always three. I've seen you're the only one in the world who eats pizza- flavored Pringles. And you never stuff the chips in, you savor each one by dividing it into four precise bites. I didn't know that was even possible. You're also the first girl I've ever seen who spends more time on her roof than in her own house. And what do you do out there? You don't talk on the phone, you don't paint your nails, you read books. Now one would think with the whole numbers thing you've got going on that you'd put them on your shelf alphabetically, but you don't. Your system's much more perfect. The ones you like go on the bottom, the ones you love go in the middle, and the ones you need, the ones you keep going back to... well they go straight to the top next to the dream encyclopedia. You know what all this tells me? You know how things should be. The world according to Ashley. And guess what? It's a very entertaining and beautiful thing. Even when it takes a hit. When you end up in a place like this... when your parents dump their baggage on you, or just... when it seems like those curveballs are never gonna stop -- It sucks, but just so you know -- I get it.

They always go up the next day -- no matter what. And even if no one else has, I've noticed that. And I ain't sorry. The only thing I'll even consider apologizing for is... not dropping the binoculars and telling you this a lot sooner. \nA long beat as Ashley peers into Kale's eyes.      She slowly steps closer to him: \nASHLEY That was either the creepiest... or the sweetest thing I've ever heard. \nKale leans in and kisses her. They pull away, lock eyes. Then -- Ashley pulls Kale by his soaking wet t-shirt, kisses him back even harder. Heavy make-out.

Now look, his remote's in the glove compartment of his Toyota. All you have to do is pop it open and read me the switch settings. \"On\" or \"off.\" \nRONNIE For the later purpose of doing what? Breaking in to his house? \nKALE No, not breaking in. We're just talking about having access to his garage so we can go in on our own time - when he's not there - to just... to get a closer look at the car, the bag -- \nRONNIE (to Ashley) All this sounds reasonable to you? \nASHLEY I don't know about that, but -- \nKALE (re: universal remote) This is good up to thirteen digits -- \nRONNIE (realizing) How long have you been planning this? \nRonnie eyes Kale with concern.

Sure he kept to himself, but he was always nice to me.\" That's what they all say. That's what all the neighbors always say -- after the fact.

Curious NEIGHBORS are now gathering across the street. \nGILES Absolutely, be my guest. \nGiles ushers them through the door and follows them into the house.

Uniform #2 unties the bag, pulls the sides away. Everyone gathers around, peers inside, then suddenly yank themselves back at the horrible STENCH emanating from within. \nKale eyes Uniform #1 who gestures him to look.       Kale steps toward the bag. \nKALE'S POV - We peer into the bag to reveal the WIDE OPEN eyes of a dead -- DEER. \nGILES (to the cops) I hit it the other night. Thought I'd save a few steps and get it off the road myself. I was gonna bury it sooner, but it's been a helluva week -- \nKALE So why'd you have to have the car fixed in record time, huh? Because it was covered in her blood -- \nGILES (talking over him; re: Mustang) Because it's a classic, I got it out of storage for the auto show, I needed it in pristine condition. \nUNIFORM #2 It's one of the biggest in the world.

He came through the inside door -- (re: TV screen) This is where I ducked low and started... \nON THE TV - Ronnie's feet start motoring across the concrete floor, racing through the doorway onto the hardwood floor... \nRONNIE (CONT'D) ...hauling aaaass... \nKALE That's great. \nON THE TV - As before, we're mostly watching Ronnie's feet as they scamper around Giles' house.

All that running around... \nRonnie heads from the room. \nKALE (re: video) I'm gonna burn this. \nKale gets up, heads to the camera. About to eject the tape, when a thought stops him. He pulls the camera off the TV, sits on the floor, presses \"PLAY\", scans back through the tape. \nON THE TV - The same footage. Nothing glaring stands out. The camera falls from Ronnie's hand, slides to the bookcase. Ronnie quickly scoops the camera up, keeps running... \nKALE (CONT'D) You're not fooling me, Giles... \nKale scans the tape back again, this time just to the point where Ronnie drops the camera. \nON KALE - his eyes suddenly narrow -- did he see something? \nKale scans back again. \n92   INT.

He picks it up, flips through it. \nGILES (CONT'D) It's funny, I hear a lot of authors say their first books were easy, it's the second one that's really hard. Wonder if your dad thought that. (off Kale's glare) See with me, it's the opposite. The very first one was... (sickly reminiscing) ...Very difficult... she was very beautiful... fragile... a lot of promise... the others in Texas were flings, low class... Patty Walsh had potential, but so did Amy. You saw her, right? When you were watching me? You should feel good, Kale, you guys saved her life. I was headed in to kill her when your girlfriend showed up. So, you're a hero, Kale. Savor the moment. (tosses the book) You have Microsoft Word? (off Kale's questioning look; re: computer) Turn it on. \nKale doesn't move.

I'm hitting a damned deer... Man, that was some shitty luck. (then) Anyway, it's pretty clear how we've gotta clean this up. The irony is, you've done all the hard stuff. Whaddaya think: \"Troubled youth finally snapped.\" Maybe because he was jealous of his girlfriend, or maybe he just couldn't deal with the guilt from not saving daddy. (off Kale) Hey, you Googled me. \nGiles steps away, turns back to the bed as Kale suddenly does SNAP. He leans forward, grabs the LCD computer monitor with his taped wrists, stands, whirls around, and HURLS it at GILES, SMACKING HIM on the side of his head -- a one in a hundred shot! Giles goes down. \nBut the forward momentum of Kale's throw combined with his taped ankles causes him to lose his balance. Kale falls to the floor, scrambles for the BASEBALL BAT just inches away -- \nGILES \nstaggers to his feet and charges Kale. Kale grabs the bat, rolls around and swings up at Giles, WHACKING HIM IN THE CHEST. Giles doubles over as Kale frantically plants the bat on the floor, using it as a \"cane\" to pull himself back to his feet. He HOPS toward Giles, raises the bat, swings it, but Giles anticipates, grabs the bat, pulls it forward, and REVERSE JABS KALE in the face!

Giles BANGS on the door. \nAshley goes to Kale, RIPS the duct tape off his mouth.   Kale SCREAMS in PAIN as Ashley heads for the desk phone. \nKALE It's dead. \nAshley grabs a pair of scissors off dad's desk, cuts Kale's ankles and hands free. Kale reaches down to the ankle bracelet, furiously tugs at it. \nASHLEY Let me try -- \nAshley moves in, tries to cut it loose with the scissors as Giles suddenly SLAMS SOMETHING against the door, trying to break it down! \nASHLEY (CONT'D) Where's your mom -- \nKALE (tugging on bracelet) Living room -- tied up -- he got Ronnie -- in the kitchen -- (then; re: bracelet) GODDAMN YOU!! \nASHLEY (giving up with scissors) Okay, just -- I'll get your mom, you figure out a way to call the cops -- \nKALE No, I've gotta get her -- \nASHLEY Kale, you've gotta get outside, get over the boundary -- do you hear me? \nKALE (beat; then; an idea sparking) Okay, but -- just follow my lead -- we're gonna need stuff -- \nCU - Kale cringes from the pain as Giles, now right behind him, wraps the SPEAKER WIRE around Kale's NECK and pulls.

Gutierrez shakes his head, zeros in on the student behind Ronnie. Sleeping with his arms folded on his desk, a grey hoodie pulled over his head. \nSENOR GUTIERREZ Senor Brecht... \nSenor Gutierrez takes some chalk, flicks it at the kid.       He still doesn't budge. Ronnie nudges him. \nRONNIE Dude -- \nThe kid stirs, raises his head. The hoodie falls away to reveal KALE. Longer, disheveled hair. The spark in his eye's been replaced with an empty haze. \nSENOR GUTIERREZ So Kale, think you can stay conscious long enough to tell us your plans for the three wondrous summer months ahead? \n(CONTINUED)    D.J.

Kale gets up, heads to the front of the class. He pauses. Trying to focus.

I haven't gotten that far. \nSENOR GUTIERREZ Did you do the homework or not? \nKALE (no eye contact) Guess not. \nSENOR GUTIERREZ (in Kale's face) You \"guess\" not. I don't know who you think you are or who you think you're dealing with. You can't give me a straight answer, fine, give me one good reason why I shouldn't fail you right now? \nKale CLOCKS Gutierrez. \n12   INT.

Kale's eyes shift her way, but his head never turns. The JUDGE mulls over his notes... \nJUDGE Okay, Mr. Brecht... \nKale's lawyer prompts him to stand. \nJUDGE (CONT'D) You're six months shy of eighteen, that means the assault-two charge you've pled guilty to carries a max of one year in juvey. With these priors, you're up to three. \nThe judge lets that sink in.       Kale remains silent. \nJUDGE (CONT'D) But losing a parent isn't easy. Which is why I'm sentencing you to three months house arrest. \nJulie closes her eyes in relief. \nJUDGE (CONT'D) You can thank your counselors and lawyer later. Mr. Brecht, I just cut you a break. Don't test me. \nThe judge taps his gavel. \n13   INT.

Kale's foot quickly steps back. GREEN LIGHT. A beat, then -- \nA SMILING GARDEN GNOME SLAMS DOWN INTO FRAME. \nWIDER - Kale ties kite string around the gnome's hat, then unspools it across the yard to a waiting croquet mallet already hammered into the ground. He pulls the string taut and ties it off. \nWe PULL BACK to REVEAL Kale's emerging KITE STRING PERIMETER -- a crude SEMI-CIRCULAR ARC around the yard tied off at different points using makeshift \"stakes\" -- gnomes, mallets, shovels, screwdrivers... \n40   EXT.

He ties some string to it as he glances over to the other neighbors' (the PILCH's) yard, sees their black Labra-doodle watching him. \nKALE Hey doggie, come here... \nThe dog trots toward Kale. It almost reaches his outstretched hand when it suddenly gets ZAPPED by the underground electric fence. It YELPS away. Spins back around, sits and stares. \nKALE (CONT'D) (re: his ankle bracelet) Hey, you and me both. \nOVER KALE'S SHOULDER IN THE B.G. - ASHLEY \nlifts more boxes from the back of their station wagon. She sets them on the drive, SLAMS the liftgate. Kale turns around. Ashley throws him a quick glance, then heads around the back of her house. Kale stares after her. \n41   INT. 2ND FL HALL OUTSIDE DAD'S OFFICE - DAY                        41 \nCU - The doorknob. Kale's hand enters frame, slowly turns it. Click. Kale pushes. \nD.J. Caruso \n42   INT. DAD'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS                             42 \nKale stands in the doorway. He takes a moment, considering what he's about to do. Then -- HIS FOOT steps inside. He goes to the window, gently pulls the blind up to reveal the \nBACK OF ASHLEY'S HOUSE \nHe peers down, sees Ashley and her mom standing by the swimming pool. Ashley disappears through the back door. \nKale tilts his head up, curiously gazing through the pair of OPEN WINDOWS on the SECOND FLOOR of Ashley's house. \nHIS POV - ASHLEY'S BEDROOM \nUnmade bed, stacks of open moving boxes, poster frames waiting to be hung... Kale squints, steps closer. \nASHLEY \nenters the room. Digging clothes from boxes, stuffing them in her dresser, then -- she pulls her hair back, yanks off her t-shirt, revealing a black bra. \nON KALE - he continues to watch as Ashley digs a towel out of a moving box, and, with her back to us, pulls off the bra and disappears into the bathroom.

He's wearing aviator shades, half a dozen leis and a hawaiian shirt. \nRONNIE (hula dancing) Aloooha Senor Ka-- Dude, you look like hell. \nREVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL KALE - now with a patchy stubble, wearing a bathrobe and a SHRUNKEN t-shirt that used to be white but is now LIGHT PINK. He holds his bat in one hand, quart of Haagen Dazs in the other. He smiles, hugs Ronnie.

Ronnie looks out. They peer down to the Pilch's backyard.       A Ford Escort is in the drive. Besides that, all's quiet. \nRONNIE -- Fascinating. \nKALE (eyeing his watch) Just wait... and... (then) Three... two... one... dog... \nThe Pilch's dog darts out the back door -- then -- \nKALE (CONT'D) ...Mrs. Pilch... saying goodbye to Lonnie... \nRONNIE Husband? \nKALE (shaking a \"no\") Maid. \nOver the above, Mrs. Pilch, wearing an unflattering tennis skirt, exits the house.

As they walk away, the dog tries to follow but gets ZAPPED by the electric fence and YELPS back into the house. \nKALE (CONT'D) And... ladies disappear... cue white Mercedes... Mr. Pilch... arriving from the office... \nA white mercedes pulls in the driveway.    MR. PILCH, 63, gets out, carrying briefcase and flowers. \nRONNIE Great, that still doesn't explain why you're in a bathrobe at four in the afternoon. \nKALE (pulls Ronnie closer) Will you just look -- \nRONNIE Dude, he's gonna see -- \nKALE He can't. We don't have any lights on. Plus the angle's sharper from ground level, it only seems like he could see us. I did the math. \nRONNIE Oh, you did the math. \nKALE Optical illusion, line-of-sight doesn't apply to the subject. \nRONNIE Kale -- \nKALE Now tilt your gaze up... \nRONNIE AND KALE'S POV - TILTING UP TO THE PILCH'S BEDROOM WINDOW - Lonnie vacuums as Mr. Pilch enters the room behind him. Mr. Pilch flips off the light switch, cutting the power to the vacuum. Lonnie startles, turns around, sees Pilch standing there with the flowers and a big smile. \nA beat, then -- Lonnie jumps in Pilch's arms, kissing him passionately. \nRONNIE DAMN!! \n(CONTINUED)   D.J.

Ronnie pulls away, reaches in his pocket, yanks out his ASTHMA INHALER and takes a hit. Then -- \nRONNIE (CONT'D) (re: hallway and window) Seal this area off, Kale. \nKALE C'mon, there's more. \nRONNIE What, I go to Maui, you become a stalker? \nKALE No, stalking's for psychos. These are just simple observations... natural side effects of chronic boredom. \nAs Kale heads away: \nRONNIE (pleading) Find your passion, Kale. \n45   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY                                          45 \nKale leads Ronnie to the window. Ronnie takes in the mess in Kale's room -- the scuff marks on the walls, the completed TWINKIE TOWER. He glances to the desk, sees a penciled GEOMETRIC DIAGRAM of Kale's line-of-sight spying theory -- shit, Kale wasn't lying -- he did do the math. \nKALE (pointing out) So... Robert Giles... \nKALE AND RONNIE'S POV - In the yard across from Kale's back yard, find ROBERT GILES, gassing up his lawnmower in the driveway. He's early 40's, clean-cut, fit, decent looking. He closes the garage door via remote, then fires up the mower, pushes it around the side of his house toward the front yard. \nKALE (CONT'D) He's lived there a couple of years, but I've never noticed he mows his lawn every two days. \nRONNIE Huh, I guess he likes his grass short. \n(CONTINUED)   D.J.

Ronnie yawns, starts snoring. Kale's hand is about to grab the knob -- \nRONNIE (V.O.) BOO! \nKALE Goddamn you!! \nKale flips the phone closed, throws it to the bed. He turns back to the door just as IT SUDDENLY PUSHES OPEN, SMACKING KALE IN THE FOREHEAD! Kale STUMBLES BACK, screams, raises the bat. \nJULIE Kale, Kale, it's me!! \nKale doesn't immediately drop the bat as he focuses on Julie, dressed in her serving uniform, barely visible in the darkness. She flips the light on. \nKALE No, don't! \nJULIE What's going on, who were you talking to?! \nKALE Ronnie -- just Ronnie. \nKale falls back to the bed. \nKALE (CONT'D) I heard the door -- \nJULIE I'm sorry, the wind caught it -- \nKALE Fine.

He opens the fridge, sees a new Mountain Dew twelve-pack.

It rolls to Giles' feet. \nGILES (picking up the can) Whoa, whoa, settle down, slow down. Robert Giles, your neighbor -- (gesturing outside) Behind you? \nKale glares, breathing hard. Giles taps on the top of the dented soda can, hands it to Kale. Kale doesn't take it. Note: Giles' shirt should have BURNT ORANGE somewhere in it, either in the pattern, stripes, etc... \nKALE I know, how did you -- \nGiles puts the soda on the counter as Julie comes through the kitchen door carrying groceries. \nGILES (to Julie) Think I startled him. \n(CONTINUED)   D.J.

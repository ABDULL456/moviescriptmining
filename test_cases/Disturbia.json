Then -- keeping his feet planted in what looks to be a very practiced maneuver, he suddenly falls forward against the mailbox. Reaches around with his free hand, opens the door, going to grab the mail inside just as \nASHLEY \npulls the car into and up the drive.    She glances at Kale who nods and smiles back. \nAs the stationwagon heads up the driveway, Kale tries to push himself upright -- but his feet SLIP. He pitches forward more. He glances back over his shoulder, sees Ashley getting out of the car and looking his way.

Then her dad appears in the doorway. Looking pissed. Kale leans closer -- \nAshley stops the DVD. From her body language, she's clearly annoyed at the interruption. The scene quickly devolves into a heated argument. But Ashley's dad gets the last word in and leaves. Ashley SLAMS the door behind him, flips off the TV, storms in the bathroom and SLAMS that door, too. \nKale watches the vacant room... waiting... another beat, then -- Ashley emerges from the bathroom with a box of tissues.

Giles appears, ducking underneath, heads back to the Mustang, gets in. Giles maneuvers the car around the driveway. The front end of the car swings around, revealing a bashed-in right front fender. \nKALE (CONT'D) Holy shit.   A dent -- \nKale races to his closet, pulls down a pair of binoculars, heads back to the window. \nBINOCULAR POV - In the garage, Giles is already out of the car, rounding the back as the garage door lowers...

Not two, not four, always three. I've seen you're the only one in the world who eats pizza- flavored Pringles. And you never stuff the chips in, you savor each one by dividing it into four precise bites. I didn't know that was even possible. You're also the first girl I've ever seen who spends more time on her roof than in her own house. And what do you do out there? You don't talk on the phone, you don't paint your nails, you read books. Now one would think with the whole numbers thing you've got going on that you'd put them on your shelf alphabetically, but you don't. Your system's much more perfect. The ones you like go on the bottom, the ones you love go in the middle, and the ones you need, the ones you keep going back to... well they go straight to the top next to the dream encyclopedia. You know what all this tells me? You know how things should be. The world according to Ashley. And guess what? It's a very entertaining and beautiful thing. Even when it takes a hit.

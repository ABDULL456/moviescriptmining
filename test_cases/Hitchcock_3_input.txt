ALFRED HITCHCOCK (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D) ..they opened the door only to discover - voila... 
He produces the manila envelope from behind his back and empties THE HORRIFICALLY GORY CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS inside onto the coffee table. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) ... Ten female heads with the tops sawn off, a dozen masks of human skin, and a pair of lips on a drawstring for a window shade. 
Hitch looks down sweetly at the circle of quietly horrified expressions... 
HEDDA HOPPER TYPE Is this really going to be you're next picture, Mr. Hitchcock? 
HITCHCOCK That is my intention, madam. Yes. 
Hitch taps the photo of ED GEIN. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I only wish he looked more like William Holden and less like Elmer Fudd. 
The other columnists scribble down the quote. 
HEDDA HOPPER TYPE Am I the only one who finds this offensive? 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I was hoping everyone would. I mean life is deeply offensive and disgusting, isn't it? 
Hitch glides off without missing a beat, past the Servers arriving with more hors d'oeuvres from the kitchen. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Try the finger sandwiches -- they're real fingers. 
He snags a martini and collars Peggy while he's at it. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Peggy. I'm going to need some research detailing a typical unmarried 30-year-old secretary from Phoenix, Arizona. 
He looks over at the pantry, where Alma can be glimpsed through the swinging door, putting food onto trays. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Her monthly rent, what she wears, what she reads, which scent or perfume she prefers... 
Hitch sees WHIT lean into view and innocently whisper something into Alma's ear making her laugh. 
PEGGY ... How she deals with a demanding boss when she's trying to relax on her weekends off? 
Hitchcock doesn't notice the joke. He now only has eyes on the pantry ahead. 
He forges on through the guests only to get waylaid by Lew. It is a classic Hitchcock moment, a character needing to get someplace being held up by someone who wants to chat -- 
LEW WASSERMAN (re: the faces of the GOSSIP COLUMNISTS) I told you, Hitch. This thing's strictly for the drive-in crowd. 
Hitch smiles tightly and extricates himself, heading on to the kitchen through more annoying guests -- 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, PANTRY - SIMULTANEOUS 
Whit leans against the stove watching Alma expertly arrange the next round of hors d'oeuvres coming in from the kitchen. 
WHITFIELD COOK Now, if this were a Hitchcock picture what would two characters like us, married to other people, be saying? 
ALMA You don't have to pretend you're not upset he hasn't read it yet, you know. 
WHITFIELD COOK I'm a big boy. I can take it. 
ALMA Well, I loved it. What terrific fun it must have been to research. 
WHITFIELD COOK Certainly more fun than reading those reviews. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D) (THEN) Do you think he really will read it? 
Suddenly, over Whitfield's shoulder, Alma sees Hitch looming in the doorway. Whit notes the tiny change in her eyes and turns. 
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D) Speak of the devil. 
Hitch stares blankly at him while Alma turns and busies herself over the sink, hiding an almost imperceptible blush. 
WHITFIELD COOK (CONT'D) I have to admit, Hitch, I ran all over town looking for a copy of "Psycho" but couldn't find a single one. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK I wonder how that could have happened. 
Hitch sips his martini, a picture of innocence. Then leans in to Whit's ear and whispers - just like Whit leaned into Alma's ear a moment earlier. 
ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D) Don't stop looking on my behalf. 
Peggy appears in the pass-through, beckoning Hitch to hurry back into the living room. 
INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

{"test1_input": "(yells, warning-like) I'm Walking Around The house! ERICA Laughs. Even she knows this is funny. Harry arrives at her open doorway, timidly pokes his head in. \nERICA \nListen, I've decided to get over the whole \"you saw me naked\" thing. So, we don't have to deal with it anymore. Okay? \nHARRY \nGood, 'cause I've been hiding from you all day. \nERICA \nI know. You want to come in? \nHARRY \nI don't want to break your rhythm or anything. \nERICA \nThat would be wishful thinking. Harry ENTERS cautiously and curiously. \nHARRY \nBeautiful painting. So I'm gonna venture out there and go for a short walk... \nERICA \nYou up to that? \nHARRY \nMy doctor recommended it. I gotta build up to stairs and stuff like that. You wouldn't want to join me? \nERICA \nThat means you don't want me to? \nHARRY \nNo, I was asking if you wanted to. \nERICA \nOh, well, I would but...I don't usually like to break once I've started writing so I probably shouldn't, not that a little fresh air would hurt but... \nHARRY \nIt's just a walk Erica, not a marriage proposal. \nERICA \nYou know my name. \nHARRY \nErica Jane Barry. I looked you up on the internet. \nEXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER - LATE .IN THE DAY \nErica and Harry walk by the water's edge. They are the only two people on the beach. \nHARRY \n-- Did you know there are over eight thousand websites that mention you? \nERICA \nThat can't be possible. \nHARRY \nNo, it's true. I know everything about you now. And not because of last night, but... \nE \nRICA \nYeah, I understood. I actually looked you up too. You grew up in L.A., which I thought nobody did. \nERICA (CONT'D) \nYou were the road manager for a group I sorta never heard of, started your own record label at 29, sold it at 45, then started buying and selling boutique companies then invested in a small record company which you turned into the 2nd largest Hip Hop label in the world. \nHARRY \nIt's exhausting just hearing about it. \nERICA \nI know, but the truth is, it goes fast doesn't it? \nHARRY \nLike the blink of an eye. Erica bends down and picks up A FLAT WHITE STONE, then another and another... \nHARRY \nI noticed you have bowls of those all over your house. \nERICA \nI know, I'm crazy, I just think they're so beautiful... \nHARRY \nBut why do you only pick up the white ones? \nERICA \nI don't only pick up the white ones. \nHARRY \nOh, so you really are crazy. \nERICA \nI pick up only the white ones? (looks in her hand) Oh, God, what does that mean? I'm controlling, unadventurous, what? \nHARRY \nSo you're as hard on yourself as you are on everyone else. Erica is stunned that he caught on to that. Harry bends down, picks up a BROWN stone, places it in her palm among the white stones. \nHARRY \nSomething to remember me by. \nErica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all. \nERICA \nSo can I ask you something Harry? What's with all the young girls? I mean, what's the story there, really? \nHARRY \nI just like to travel light. \n", "test1_true": "You just like to travel light? Oh, please, what the hell does that mean? \nHARRY \nNow see a thirty year old gets that. \nERICA \nYou mean falls for that. \nHARRY \nI mean, accepts it. \nERICA \nIf that's what you want... a non threatening woman, who won't get your number, you get to run the show... \nHARRY \nI think our relationship is growing by the way. Have you noticed? There he goes again. She can't believe he's cute like this. \nHARRY \nI'm serious. Maybe we just needed to get out of the house. Now, you may notice, interestingly, we're walking back toward the house and its getting a little rocky again. \nERICA \nOf course it's getting a little rocky, we're talking about you. \nHARRY \nSee, I'll accept that slight hostility because I'm enjoying your company so much. \nT \nhey're reached the bottom of the beach stairs. Harry looks up, daunted. \nERICA \nYou okay? \nHARRY \nYeah, but I think I'11 stay down here and watch the sunset. You interested? Erica checks her watch. \nHARRY \nBig dinner date? \nERICA \nWell, yeah, as a matter of fact. With your doctor. \nHARRY \nOhhhhh, my doctor, 'cause he's not too young for you, huh? \nERICA \nNo, he's totally too young for me. But we're just having dinner. It's not a date. \nHARRY \nDoes he know that? \nERICA \nWell, I'll tell him, but I doubt that he thinks of it that way. \nHARRY \nI doubt that you doubt that. Anyway, you may like it. Think of it this way -- he's not threatening, won't get your number, you get to run the show. You might have a hell of a time. Over, we HEAR, DING DONG. \nTHAT NIGHT - THE FRONT DOOR - SWINGS OPEN \nAnd we find Julian. Looking just as any girl would hope. Dream Date. \nAND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR \nis Harry, in his robe and PJ's. \nJULIAN \nHey, look who's answering the door. \nHARRY \nAnd look who's at the door. \nJULIAN \nBrought you something. \nJulian hands him a take-out food box. \nJULIAN \nA heart healthy dinner from our cafeteria. \nERICA (O.S.) \nHello... Both guys turn at once. She looks beautiful, wearing a dress, probably the sexiest one she owns. No turtleneck tonight. Julian walks to her, kisses her on the cheek. \nJULIAN \nYou look beautiful. \nERICA \nThank you. Behind Julian's back Harry gives Erica the 'OK' sign. \nERICA \n(thrown) We ready..? \nJULIAN \nLet me just see how Harry's doing. It'll take two seconds. Har, have a seat. . \nANGLE - HARRY \nsitting, self-conscious in his new role - The Sick One. Julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse. Harry looks straight ahead. \nWHAT HE SEES - ERICA'S LEGS \nas she sits right in front of him. She crosses her legs and her dress hikes up a little, exposing her thigh. JULIAN furrows his brow. \nHARRY \nWhat? That's not the face you want to see your doctor making. \nJULIAN \nYour pulse is a little fast but maybe you're just excited about something. Harry LOOKS AT ERICA'S LEGS again. \n", "test1_id": 1425, "test2_input": "HARRY \nWhat are you leaning towards? \nERICA \nDeath. (Harry reacts) It's funnier. \nHARRY \nHe dies of a funny heart attack? \nERICA \nHe's sort of a schmuck who screwed around with our heroine, so it won't be too sad. \nHARRY \nSchmucks are people too you know. Death doesn't seem a little harsh? \nERICA \nI just went where the story took me. It's a work of fiction, Harry. Really...just stuff I made up. \nSTAGE MANAGER \n(approaching) Erica, we're ready to do the hospital, 'Do You Take Viagra scene... Should we wait for you? \nErica nods, horrified. \nHARRY \nSo I'm going to be the laughing stock of Broadway. \nERICA \nHarry, he's not you. He's a version of the truth of you. So to speak. \nSTAGE MANAGER \nSorry to interrupt again but Dave wants to know, when Henry says, \"I love ya\", you want that to be 'Ya', not 'You', right? \nERICA \nRight. We now HEAR Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose play throughout the theater. The BEACH backing is 'raised and an EIFFEL TOWER BACKING is lowered behind them. They both try to ignore the music, but it's impossible. \nE \nRICA \nWell, you look really nice. You feeling all right? As they stand in front of the Eiffel Tower backing, FAKE SNOW FALLS from above... \nHARRY \nYou know it isn't like I wanted to stop seeing you. We could've carried on a fun thing for awhile. Why is it you dames want all or nothing? \nERICA \nI don't know, we're just goofy when it comes to love... Look, Harry, if it's all right with you, I'd like to be friends \nHARRY \nI'm not ready to be your friend. How's that? \nERICA \nFine. I understand. \nHARRY \nAnyway, do you actually buy that horse shit.. .that men and women can be friends once they've had sex? \nERICA \nI'm friends with my ex-husband, but then again, we didn't just have sex. \nHARRY \nWe didn't just have sex either. \nERICA \nThen what was it? Love to know. \nHARRY \nCan I e-mail it to you when I figure it out? (laughs) This is perfect. I have given the `Can't We Be friends' speech for 40 years. I think I invented the 'Can't We Be Friends' speech. But you know what,now I get why they never went for it. You dames got one thing right. Sometimes sex does change everything. Call me crazy, but I just don't see us out on the town, being pals, having dinner, 'cause I'd bet you anything, at some point, one of us will have very unfriend like thoughts about the other then pass the bread becomes anything but pass the bread. You get what I'm saying? \nERICA \nYou don't want to be friends. \nHARRY \nNot \"don't\". Can't. Can't be friends. Doesn't work that way. (tries to calm down) Okay, I'm moving into another phase of this thing. I'm mad at you. (realizes) It almost feels good. \nERICA \nI think I'm mad at you too. \nHARRY \nExcellent. 'Cause I don't like thinking about you so much and worrying about how you are and if I ruined your life or... \nERICA \n-- You've worried about me? \nHARRY \nYes honey, the schmuck who deserves to die, worries about you. \nHARRY(cont'd) Sometimes worrying about you feels like a full time job. \nERICA \nWell, doll, I'm doing fine. So you don't have to work that shift anymore. Again, The Stage Manager... \nSTAGE MANAGER \nErica, they want you to take a look at the costumes for the dancing Henry's. These gonna work for you? Harry and Erica TURN and SEE a CHORUS LINE of BALDING 60 YEAR \nOLD MEN IN HOSPITAL GOWNS AND SOCKS. \nEXT. THEATER - DAY \nHarry FLIES OUT the Stage Door, right into the street, is almost hit by a motorcycle, doesn't seem to care. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY \nHarry walks briskly through the park, still pissed, his pace starting to get to him. He spots a bench with a WOMAN JOGGER at one end. He parks himself at the other end of the bench, out of breath. Tries H reason with himself. to \nARRY \nGod is a woman, I know that now. No man would punish me like this. \nWOMAN JOGGER \n", "test2_true": "HARRY \nDo you know me or are you just talking to me as \"man\" in general, the beast women love to hate. \nWOMAN JOGGER \nNo, no, I know you Harry. \nHARRY \nOh. Don't tell me. I dated your daughter. (the Woman laughs) Right? I broke her heart then she married some hard working Joe on the rebound, has three great kids. What is so funny? \nWOMAN JOGGER \nYou dated me and you broke my heart but after you I met the right guy. I've been married thirty-seven years, have four kids, eight grandkids and a ninth on the way. Harry now fully turns in her direction, totally clueless. \nHARRY \nI dated you. .? (the Woman nods) Did we. ever...? \nWOMAN JOGGER \nNo...we did not. He looks at her hard but still doesn't remember her. \nHARRY \nCan you give me hint? A year? A decade? \nWOMAN JOGGER \nThe sixties. (Harry squints at her) You took me to Shea Stadium. \nHARRY \nTo a Mets game?    I must've really liked you. \nWOMAN JOGGER \nYou took me to see The Beatles. \nHARRY \nOh, God, I really liked you. You're Sandra. ..Cook. We did. We saw The Beatles together. How the hell have you been? What happened to you? \nSANDRA \nWell, let's see, after we stopped going out, I went back to school, got my doctorate in marine biology, went around the world a few times, met the man of my dreams at Oxford, married him, we lived in London for 25 years. I wrote and taught, we raised 3 sons and a daughter. I've just finished my ninth book and now I'm training for my first marathon. Now, I must confess, I actually remember the very last thing you ever said to me. \nSANDRA(cont'd) You walked me to my door, I was tearful and you looked at me with those puppy dog eyes and said, \"Honey, I just don't know how to be a boyfriend.\" Now, tell me, what have you been up to since 1964? OVER Harry's face, we HEAR the SOUND of a SIREN BLARING. \nINT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nHarry is wheeled through the ER with the gurney. Dr. Martinez runs along with the gurney. \nDR. MARTINEZ \nMr. Langer... Back so soon. \nHARRY \nThis is it, I'm dyin', I've had 20 minutes of severe chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, blood pressure's gotta be 170 over 100. (sticks out his arm) Give me the nitrate, I didn't take viagra. (rips open his shirt) Plug me in to the EKG, I need an aspirin, I'm taking 2 beta blockers, blood thinner, Lipitor, Procardia and if I were you, I'd be pounding my chest. Ow! \nMALE NURSE \nYou're a doctor, huh? \nHARRY \nJust a very sick man. \nCLOSE - THE PAPER TAPE FROM HARRY'S EKG \nDr. Martinez reads it. \nDR. MARTINEZ \nMr. Langer, your diagnosis although fascinating, was entirely incorrect. \nHARRY \nThat's impossible. \nDR. MARTINEZ \nYour realize a severe anxiety attack can masquerade as a heart attack. \nHARRY \nSo I'm nuts? Perfect! The one thing I'm not taking pills for. \nDR. MARTINEZ \nIf you don't want ,to end up in here every week, I suggest you do whatever it takes to decompress. Try something with me, okay? (takes his pulse) Close your eyes...now give yourself a visual image of something that gives you a feeling of peace and serenity. \nHARRY \nI don't know. A hammock... \nDR. MATINEZ \nOkay, good...what else..? \nHARRY \nPalm trees...clear blue water... We hear the SOUND OF LAPPING WATER, SEA GULLS. . . . \nDR. MARTINEZ \nAnybody there with you? \nHARRY \nYes. Beautiful women...in thongs... \nDR. MARTINEZ \n(disgusted) Okay. What else do you see, feel, taste... \nHARRY \nA margarita...a Cuban cigar. ..miles of soft beach.. . \nDR. MARTINEZ \nKeep going...you're doing great... And as Harry keeps listing things, Camera MOVES IN ON HIM as the STEEL BAND gets LOUDER AND LOUDER. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE WORDS. . . \nSIX MONTHS LATER \nFALLING SNOW FILLS THE FRAME \nBoom down to see the THEATER MARQUEE of Erica's play on Broadway. On the Marquee are raves from critics, \"****\", and a banner that brags, \"Sold Out!\". \n", "test2_id": 1426, "test3_input": "C \nAMERA CONTINUES DOWN to street level. Couples walk by, bundled up against the cold. Harry ENTERS FRAME. \nHe looks different. He has a beard and has lost some weight: And in his eyes, a calm we haven't seen before. He pauses in front of the theater -- loo~s at the PUBLICITY PHOTOS. He SEES Henry in his boxer shorts at the refrigerator meeting \"Emily\" and her Sister. He sees ANOTHER PHOTO of The Dancing Henrys kicking up their legs like Rockettes. Then, finally, A PHOTO of Henry and Emily in bed, both wearing glasses. Harry OPENS THE DOOR TO THE THEATER, steps inside and listens, hearing Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose, then, the audience breaks out in LAUGHTER. Harry smiles to himself. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING \nThe elevator opens. Harry steps out, looks around for an apartment number, finds it, rings the bell and clears his throat. The door quickly OPENS and we see MARIN. She looks relaxed and happy to see him. \nMARIN \nI couldn't believe you were calling from downstairs. (hugs him) So great to see you. \nHARRY \nYou couldn't look better. \nMARIN \nThank you. Come on in. \nHARRY \nNo, no, I just wanted to stop by and say hi and tell you I'm sorry if I ever did anything to you that wasn't on the up and up or... \nMARIN \nWhat do you mean? You were great to me. \nHARRY \nI was? \nMARIN \nAlways. \nHARRY \nThat's refreshing. Good. Well, I don't know what you've done to yourself but you look absolutely radiant. \nMARIN \nI'm three months pregnant, that might have something to do with it. \nHARRY, \nReally? Who's ..the, lucky guy? \nMARIN \nMy husband, hold on, he really wants to meet you. (calls) Danny... A Solid Citizen of a Guy joins Marin, loosened tie, glasses... \nMARIN \nHarry Langer, my husband, Danny Yellin. \nDANNY \n(shaking Harry's hand) I've heard so much about you... \nHARRY \nI bet.. . \nDANNY \nYeah, with Hthe play and all... \nARRY \nI'm famous,huh? \nMARIN \nJust to us. In every interview my Mom does, she always says she made you up. \nHARRY \nSo the guy in the play, he doesn't make it, does he? \nDANNY \nHe basically dies at the end of the second act, but it's very funny. (as if that's some consolation) \nHARRY \nWas hopin' she'd give me a reprieve, but... \nMARIN \nYeah, well... \nHARRY \nYeah. Okay...Best of luck, kids... Marin is stumped by this little visit. Harry heads toward the elevator, pushes the button, then turns back. \nHARRY \nHow is she? \nMARIN \nShe's. . . (Harry waits) Really good.     Up to her old tricks. Learning Italian, remodeling her apartment in the city. \nHARRY \nNow if I wanted to see her...how would that go over? \nMARIN \n(encouragingly) Only one way to find out, except she's out of town right now. \nHARRY \nOh yeah? Where is she? \nMARIN \nParis. She left two days ago, for her birthday. But she'll be back next week... The Elevator arrives. Harry salutes his goodbye and steps INSIDE THE ELEVATOR. He turns, FACES CAMERA. \nHARRY \nParis... \nANOTHER ELEVATOR.OPENS \nAnd a clean shaven, dapper looking Harry steps off, cashmere coat, gorgeous scarf. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM out of the elevator and through a BEAUTIFUL LOBBY OF A HOTEL then right onto THE STREET. CAMERA does a 360 and we catch glimpses of PARIS AT NIGHT. CAMERA SETTLES ON HARRY just as the LIGHTS OF THE EIFFEL TOWER POP ON, sending a flood of golden lights high into the night sky directly behind him. \nHARRY \nShowtirne. \nINT. LEFT BANK BISTRO - NIGHT \nErica sits alone at a table in the back of the room, drinking a glass of wine. She looks vibrant. She glances up from her drink and sees what looks like Harry making his way around the tables. She leans to the side for a better look, to make sure it's him. It is him and he's corning right toward her. Her stomach sinks, her mind races... and before she can come up with a single thought that makes any sense -- there he is. \n", "test3_true": "(proud of himself) I knew you'd be here. \nERICA \nYou did? \nHARRY \nI've come a long way to see you, Erica. \nERICA \nYou mean we're not bumping into each other..? You came here to see me? \nHARRY \nYes, I did. (she seems to shiver) I'm aware it was a bold move, one of those impulses that grabs you,' but...so far, we're okay; right? \nERICA \nWell, uh, I mean, I'm just... \nHARRY \nI'll take that as a 'Yes'. Harry takes off his coat and scarf, hangs them on a hook. \nERICA \nYou want a glass of wine or something? \nHARRY \nI was just gonna give you a kiss hello. \nERICA \nOh, Okay. Neither is sure where to go. Cheek? Lips? He lands on her chin. .Not what he wanted, but he takes a seat across from her. She looks at him - utterly speechless. \nHARRY \nI remember you said if we still know each other we should go to Paris for our birthdays, well, we still know each other..\". \nERICA \nThat's true, but, Harry, I haven't heard from you in six months. \nHARRY \nI know but I've certainly been thinking about you. There's a lot I have to say. First thing is... I'm not mad at you anymore. \nERICA \nGood, 'cause I'm not mad at you anymore either. \nHARRY \nThat's a relief...since I did come all the way to France and everything. And... Happy Birthday. \nERICA \n(afraid of everything he could possibly say) Thank you. \nHARRY \nAnd congratulations on your amazing success... \nERICA \nIt's been quite a ride. Funny, I thought maybe I'd hear from you when it opened. Where've you been? \nHARRY \nAfter I saw you in the theater that afternoon, I had another \"episode... \nERICA \nOh, I'm sorry. \nHARRY \nI was actually okay, but I was sure I was dying and the doctor in the ER said I needed to decompress. So I did. I walked out of there and changed my life, sold most of my businesses, packed my bags and moved to an island in the Caribbean. \nE \nRICA \nThat's where you've been all this time? In the Caribbean? \nHARRY \nActually...No. \nEXT. CARIBBEAN BEACH - FLASHBACK \nHarry lies on a chaise under a palm tree, drink in hand, Hawaiian shirt, shades. A steel drum plays in the distance. \nHARRY (V.O. \nI was there about ,six hours, when it occurred to me that wasting away on an island in the Caribbean wasn't going to remotely cure what was ailing me. Harry sits straight up into CAMERA. \nBLACK SCREEN \nA LIGHT POPS ON and we realize we are in HARRY'S CLOSET. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nSo I decided to take another kind of pilgrimage...into my past. Harry ENTERS THE CLOSET, reaches onto a top shelf ,and starts pulling down dozens of what used be called, \"Little Black Books\". \nHARRY (V.O.) \nMy thought was -- if I retraced my steps and visited all the women I've dated... He blows dust off of the books. \nBACK IN PARIS \nHARRY \n-- maybe I could figure out how I got so screwed up. \nFLASHBACK - HARRY'S PILGRIMAGE \nHarry STANDS at one FRONT DOOR after the NEXT, EACH ONE \nSLAMMING IN HIS FACE. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nA lot of the women wouldn't see me. Then, we see WOMEN of various ages SLAP HIM ACROSS THE FACE. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nOr speak to me. Harry reels backwards from one Hefty Mama. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nBut I was on a mission to save my soul. \n", "test3_id": 1427}

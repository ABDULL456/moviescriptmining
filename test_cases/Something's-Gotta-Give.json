{"train": "SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE \nNancy Meyers June 14, 2002 \nOVER BLACK \nWe hear, Ja Rule's \"Livin' It Up\"... \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT - MUSIC OVER \nMIDTOWN. A Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body. A Club in THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT. A long line waits to get in. A couple of Gorgeous Girls show up at the velvet rope and are promptly\" let inside. SOHO. A Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk. A Confident Knock Out in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking a beer out of the bottle. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nAhhhh... The sweet, uncomplicated satisfaction of The Younger Woman. That fleeting age when everything just falls right into place. It's magic time and it can render any man, anywhere -- absolutely helpless. Some say I'm an expert on The Younger Woman. Guess that's 'cause I've been dating them for over forty years... \nINTO AN EMPTY FRAME COMES HARRY LANGER \nWhat is it about him? Could be his eyes, the turn of his mouth...something about this guy is just so damn appealing. Maybe it's just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his arm. He's confident, cool, enviable. We're in: \nA CHIC EATERY - DOWNTOWN \nThe place is full. Everybody is somebody here. \nHARRY \n(to Hostess) Langer. .. The Maitre'd snaps to attention at the sight of him. \nMAITRE'D \nMr. Langer, got your table waiting. As Harry and his Girl wend their way around tables, we pass Other Couples. Young Couples. Middle-aged couples. Not talking Couples. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nSo what does a life of bucking the system all add up to? \nHARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) \nTo never settle down with the right woman for a life of leftovers and Christmas mornings. No his and her IRA accounts, no mini van parked in the garage. I think it's made me what I am today. (Harry smiles to someone across the room) The luckiest son of a bitch on earth. Look at me. I'm positively debonair. I should be illegal I'm lookin' so good. Harry passes a table where a BEATEN SIXTY YEAR OLD dines with his AGE APPROPRIATE, WELL-FED WIFE. IN SLOW MOTION, Harry and The Beaten Man catch each other's glance. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nIt isn't as if I haven't wondered what my life would be like if I was a Regular Joe and came in here once a month with a dame my age' for a porterhouse and a side of I         spinach. I've wondered... \nNT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION \nHarry ENTERS all over again. This time he looks older, something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket. With him is a regular looking, nothing-to-write-home-about WOMAN \nIN HER FIFTIES. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nNo, come on, let's be honest. ..a dame really my age. . . \nINT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION - TAKE TWO \nAgain, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he looks ten years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The twinkle in his eye, long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD BATTLE AX, built just like Harry. The Maitre'd reluctantly shows them to a shitty table. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nThere you have it. The story in a nutshell. Not exactly debonair, am I? (Harry TRIPS, his wife looks disgusted) Awww, man, it's down right sad. Look at me. I look like I'm about to die. God help me. I do not want to die. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nA LONG STRETCH OF PRISTINE COUNTRY ROAD - THE HAMPTONS - DAY \nA Silver Mercedes convertible bursts into FRAME. Harry's behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. Next to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An \"IT\" Girl. Smart, sexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art. Her hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year age difference between them. Her name is MARIN. She SINGS along with Ja Rule, now coming from a CD. \nMARIN \n( singing) To all my thugs that be livin' it up, we say, what I do. To all my... (stops) Oh! This is it. Make a right. \nHARRY \n(admiring the neighborhood) So baby, you're rich... . \nMARIN \nWell, my mother is, sort of. Not really... \nHARRY \nIf she lives within a mile of here, she's rich. \nMARIN \nI guess a hit play will buy you a house in The Hamptons. \nHARRY \nI'd like to meet your mother. \nMARIN \nNo you wouldn't. I mean, she's great. She's totally brilliant, but she's not your type. \nHARRY \nYou're overlooking one of the great things about me. I don't have a type. \nMARIN \n(very directly) She's over thirty. Harry looks to Marin, feigning hurt. \nMARIN \nOh, what?! Like you don't know you have a slight reputation for... \nJust then the CAR PHONE RINGS. Harry keeps looking at Marin. \nHARRY \n-- For what? Harry waits. RINGGG! He doesn't look away. \nMARIN \nFor never dating anyone over 30. Don't look at me like that. \nHARRY \nIt's just not true. \nMARIN \nOkay. Sorry. Over 31? \nHARRY \nOh, so you wait 'til we get out to The Hamptons to let me know you're a wise ass. (answers phone) Hold on. . . (then to Marin) It just so happens, my dear, that women of a certain age, don't date me. You ever think of it that way? No, it's always me. You dames are all alike. (then into phone) Hey... \nMARIN \n(amused, to herself) Dames... Marin continues singing along with Ja Rule as Harry confidently slips his hand onto her thigh. \nBARRY \n(into phone) Vh-huh.. .I'll call back Monday. Who else? Monday... Monday... Say you couldn't find me. Who? (glances at Marin, she's not listening) I'll call her later. No, I have it. Harry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if' she caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that card. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass and the ocean stretch before them. \nHARRY \n(eyeing the knife) Do you... live here? \nERICA \nOkay, Mister, look, I'm gonna dial 911 and you're not gonna move. Zoe, hand me the phone. (reaches out to Zoe without looking at her) \nHARRY \nYou don't understand. I'm a friend of your daughter's. With that, Harry SHUTS the fridge door. The Women see he's naked except for a Pair of Boxers. They both GASP. Zoe FUMBLES the phone over to Erica who dials quickly.. \nERICA \nYeah? I don't think so. My daughter's in the city and you what, wandered in here,like high on Ecstasy..?. (looks at phone) Shit. I dialed 8-1-1. (redials) \nHARRY \n(calmly starts to move) Honestly, if you just... \nERICA \nBack off. She was in the Israeli army. She can break you in half. Zoe can't believe she just said that -- no truth in it whatsoever. \nERICA \n(into phone) Yes. I have an intruder in my house. 29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack. \nHARRY \nI'm dating your daughter Marin. She invited me here for the weekend. She's in her room right now, changing. \nERICA \n(GASPS even louder, really scared now) You're dating my daughter? \nHARRY \n(amused) Now who would've thought that would be worse news? With that, Marin ENTERS, in a tiny bikini, sees Harry in his shorts, Zoe holding the knife and Erica frozen, holding the phone. \nMARIN \nOh, fuck. \nERICA \nOh, God. (into phone) I'm sorry. False alarm. Yeah, no, I'm sure. No, he's not a burglar (with enormous difficulty) He's dating my daughter. \nMARIN \nMom, I had no idea you were coming out this weekend, you said you had to write. \nERICA \nI do. I thought I'd do it out here. \nMARIN \nOh, man, this is really.... \nERICA \nAwkward. \nMARIN \nTotally.. .but.... (starts laughing) You gotta admit, sorta funny You thought he was a burglar? In his boxer shorts? \nERICA \nYeah, well, the world's nuts, I don't know the man. . . \nMARIN \n(still laughing) I'm sorry, it's not really funny. I'm an idiot. I should've told you I was bringing someone out. \nE \nRICA \nNo, no, I should've told you we were coming. Well. Anyway, here we are. (waves to Harry) Hello. I'm the mother. \nAll three Women turn to Harry who now dangles a long Lobster shaped oven mitt over his \"privates\"... \nHARRY \nHarry Langer. How are ya? \nMARIN \nYes. Sorry... Mom, this is my friend, Harry. Harry, my Mom, Erica... my Aunt, Zoe. (they all shake hands) Harry's sort of a new friend. I think I mentioned him in an e-mail. We just, totally spur of the moment thought we'd get out of the city for a few days. \nERICA AND ZOE \nOf course...Right...Great... \nERICA \n(can't look at him) Honey, does Harry have a robe? \nHARRY \n(backing out) You know what? Actually, I think I should just take off. Let you gals enjoy your weekend... Marin shoots her Mom a look. Help! \nERICA \nNo, no, no. Don't be silly. Uh, look, here's what we'll do. Zoe and I will leave. We took a great walk on the beach, we'll go into town for lunch. You two stay. Harry, apologize about the near arrest. \nHARRY \nNo, you were impressive. Very strong, very... \"macho\". \nERICA \n(a little thrown) I don't think I was exactly \"macho\" \nHARRY \nTrust me, if I ever catch a guy in his underwear in my refrigerator I hope I'm half the man you were, Mrs uh... \nERICA \n(already hating him) Yeah. Okay. Whatever... Marin watches. Dying. \nHARRY \nAll righty then...I'm definitely gonna hit the road. (salutes Erica and Zoe) Ladies...sensational meeting you. (then to Marin) Doll, call me. \nZOE \nHold on. Hold on. Let's not get so dramatic here. What are we four teenagers? We're all sophisticated people. Why can't we all stay, for the weekend? Your mother's got work to do I've got papers to grade. You'll do your thing, whatever that is and if we want to hang together, we'll hang together. If we don't, we don't. There's no reason why any of us should give up this spectacular weekend. \nMARIN \nSeriously. I can handle it. \nZOE \nHip Hop? Oh, rap? Oh, right. Well. (with disdain) Okay. That's... \"interesting\"... \nHARRY \nLet me see if I get where you're headed here. . . \nERICA \nI'm sorry, but, look, you know I hate rap, I mean I do. It's sort of violent and crude for my taste, not to mention just a tad misogynistic. \nHARRY \nHey, a lot of people see rapping as poetry. \nERICA \nYeah, but come on, how many words can you rhyme with 'Bitch'? Erica places her groceries on the check out counter. \nMARIN \n(joining Harry) How we doin? \nHARRY \nShould've left when she tried to arrest me. \nINT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT \nMarin serves plates of pasta with lobster. Zoe pours wine and Erica tosses a salad. Harry is the only one sitting. \nMARIN \nSo, Mom, how's the new play? You gettin' happy with it? Marin places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger along \"the nape of his neck. They smile at each other as she continues on. Erica notices, tries not to respond. \nERICA \nWell, the thing with me is that I'm about 90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the talent part hasn't exactly kicked in yet. \nZOE \nYeah, right... \nHARRY \nWhat's your play about? Marin and Zoe stop what they are doing and turn to Erica. She's hesitant to reveal this. \nERICA \nAbout? Well, I'm not exactly sure which is a bit of a problem, but so far it's about a divorced woman, a writer, she's this high strung, over-amped, controlling, know it all neurotic. . . (everyone stares at her) Who's incredibly cute and lovable. (more stares) It's a comedy. (takes a seat next to Zoe) \nM \nSo, how did you two meet? \nARIN \nAt a Wine Auction at Sotheby's. Harry was the big buyer of the night. \nHARRY \nI kept winking at Marin as she was conducting the auction and apparently every time I did that she misunderstood and I ended up buying cases of outrageously expensive wine. \nZoe and Marin laugh. \nERICA \nEver been married, Harry? \nHARRY \nNo. No, I haven't. \nERICA \nWow. Now why do you think that is? \nHARRY \nSome people just don't fit the mold. And so far... \nERICA \nHey, if it ain't broke. \nHARRY \nExactly. Harry leans back, places his arm around Marin's chair. Erica takes note. \nZOE \nWait a second, aren't you like a famous bachelor? \nHARRY \nI wouldn't say I'm famous. \nZOE \nNo, I think I read a piece on you in New York Magazine. \nHARRY \nI guess people find it interesting that I've escaped the noose for so long. \nZOE \nYeah, wasn't the name of the article, \"The Escape Artist\"? \nERICA \nWait. I read that article. That was you? You were once engaged to somebody big. Who was it? Not Joan Collins.. .Wait. ..Carly Simon? \nZOE \nYeah, it was somebody cool like that. (trying to remember) Not Martha Stewart.... \nMARIN \nYou could just ..'ask him. \nHARRY \nNo, this is more fun. It's like I'm not here. \nMARIN \nHarry was once engaged to Diane Sawyer. Okay? \nZOE \nRight. Diane Sawyer. I love her. \nERICA \n(stunned) I'm impressed. \nHARRY \nMARIN \n(hugs her back) I love you more. This is obviously a ritual between them. Erica kisses Marin's cheek in a flutter of kisses, then Marin \nEXITS. \nZOE \nNo chance he said we were nice. \nERICA \nPlease. None. They HEAR MUSIC coming from Marin's bedroom. \nZOE \nWhat are they listening to? \nERICA \nI don't care... (listens) Oy. Marvin Gaye. . . Erica turns on the garbage disposal. Zoe sings along, \"Let's get it on\". .., Erica shoots her a look, turns off the garbage disposal, doing the dishes with vigor. \nERICA \nI know she'll never see him after this weekend. She can't commit either. Then they hear Marin GIGGLING. \nZOE \nHe does sound fun. Marin YELPS. \nZOE \nAdmit it, he's got something. You felt it, right? Then they hear Marin SCREAM. \nERICA \nOh, this is nuts... Erica covers her ears with her hands. Then they hear Marin SCREAM \"MOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!\" \nERICA \nDid she say, Mom? \nINT. MARIN'S ROOM - ANGLE - THE DOOR \nErica and Zoe bust into the room and find Harry .on the floor, leaning against the bed, a clenched fist on his chest. His shirt is open, he's sweating, his complexion is grey. Marin stands back, freaked out, afraid to get near him. \nMARIN \nWe were fooling around and he said he felt funny Hthen he just collapsed. \nARRY \n(out of breath) It's nothing. I'm okay maybe it was the lobster... \nERICA \nDoes your chest hurt? \nHARRY \nLike an elephant's standing on it. \nERICA \n(to Marin) Call 911...tell them to send an ambulance. . . Marin hesitates. \nERICA \nMarin! Now! \nHARRY'S POV - THE ROOM \nSpinning. When he shuts his eyes, it goes BLACK. Spinning. BLACK. Spinning. BLACK. He sees Marin, soft in the background, on the phone and Erica coming toward him. He hears Zoe: \nZOE(O.S.) \nWhat are you doing? \nERICA \n(coming closer) Mouth to mouth... \nON HARRY \nEven in this state he gets that Erica is about to place her. mouth on his. His eyes WIDEN IN HORROR, he reels back. Erica catches this. \nERICA \nYou fucking guy... \nShe does it anyway. Her-mouth on his, her breath into his lungs, over and over. Harry's eyes roll back in hi-so head. As. Erica pounds on his chest, we HEAR THE BLARE OF A \nSIREN... \nAND A LOUD CLANG \nAs the DOORS to SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL FLY OPEN. Paramedics WHEEL Harry through the corridors and into the ER with dizzying speed. Two Nurses jostle Harry OFF the gurney and \nONTO A BED. \nDR. JULIAN MERCER arrives at Harry's side. Julian is in his early-thirties and has finally just graduated out of the 'you look too young to be a doctor' syndrome. Julian is a man whose goodness makes him sexy. He wears his hair shaggier than you'd expect but then again, this is a Johns Hopkins graduate who chose to live near the beach and work nights. The Nurses place oxygen in Harry's nose, .;hook him up to a heart monitor and connect him to an IV. \nJULIAN \nHow we doing here? \nPARAMEDIC #1 \nHe's had 30 minutes of chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, blood pressure's 170 over 100, pulse 104, respirations 18... \nJULIAN \nLet's get an EKG. Mr. Langer, I'm Dr. Mercer. Are you in any pain right now? The Nurse wheels over an EKG machine, Julian helps hook it up. \nHARRY \nFeel some pressure in my chest...it's real tight. \nJULIAN \nCan you show me where the pain is? Harry clenches his fist over his sternum. \nJULIAN \nWhat were you doing at the onset of the pain? \nHARRY \nI was uh, kissing a beautiful... \nJULIAN \n(watching the monitor) Where you having intercourse? \nHARRY \n-- Unfortunately, no. \nJULIAN \nNo, whoever got him here so fast should be thanked. Another half hour and I don't know if this would've worked. Marin pats her Mom on the back. \nERICA \nOh, man... (realizing it all now) This was...intense. Erica wipes away a tear. Nothing could surprise her more. \nJULIAN \nWe're out of the woods. I've given him something to sleep, it might make him a little loopy at first but then it should knock him out. (to Erica) You're Mrs. Langer? \nERICA \nNo, no I'm just... No. I'm Erica Barry. . He was having dinner at our house. I just met him this afternoon. \nJULIAN \nYou're Erica Barry? \nERICA \nYes. \nJULIAN \nThe playwright? \nERICA \nYes... \nJULIAN \nWhat a pleasure. I'm a huge fan. Huge fan. \nERICA \nReally? Oh, thanks... This is my daughter, Marin, my sister, Zoe... \nJulian says Hi to each then returns his attention fully and devotedly to Erica. Takes her in. \nJULIAN \nWow. \nCLOSE - A JAPANESE TEA POT \nJulian pours steaming hot tea into 3 paper cups. \nMARIN - CLOSE \nSitting in the hospital corridor as JULIAN'S HAND ENTERS HER FRAME and hands her a cup of tea. She looks up at him with more adorableness than most men could handle. She blows on \nM \nthe steam. \nARIN \nThanks. Camera Pans to ZOE. Sitting next to Marin. She is also handed a Cup of Tea. Even she softens as she looks up at Julian. \nZOE \nThank you Doctor. This is all beginning to feel a little like the Step Sisters trying on the Glass Slipper. Until we get to Erica, not paying any attention at all as she is handed her Tea. \nERICA \nOh. . .Hey. . .Ew. . .Hot. Thanks. \nJULIAN \n(eyes on Erica) You're welcome. May I join you? \nERICA \nYeah. Sure. This is very nice of you. \nJULIAN \nFirst year of medical school you learn what can keep you up all night without making you nuts. Green Tea beats everything plus it's a great antioxidant. Cheers. \nMARIN \n(turning on the charm) So, urn, do you always work nights? \nJULIAN \nUsually two or-three a week, gives me a chance for a real life during the day. . . (immediately turns back to Erica) You know, I heard you had a place in the Hamptons. I really am a very big fan. I honestly think I've seen every play you've ever written. \nERICA \nI think some were written before your time. There are some Marin's never even seen. \nJULIAN \nNo, I'm pretty sure I've seen them all and I saw the last one twice. Zoe nudges Erica as a Nurse enters from the ER. \nNURSE \nDoctor, we've got a walk in, may need stitches. . . \nJULIAN \n(rises) I'll check on MI. Langer...if he's asleep; you all might want to get some shut eye and come back in the morning. Great to meet you Erica. Ladies. . . The Women wave and watch him exit. The second he's gone: \nERICA \n(to Marin) Okay, now that's a perfect a guy for you. He's adorable. \nMARIN \nMother! I've never seen a man less interested in me. \nZOE \nOr more interested in you. \nERICA \nMe? He's thirty years old. \nMARIN \nNo, he's older than that. \nZOE \nWho cares how old, he is. I mean, he's not my type, he's like a gorgeous wholesome doctor but, he's perfect for you and hot for you, which makes him really perfect. \nERICA \nStop it. He likes my work. Not me. (they just stare at her) It's insane. I would never. (off Zoe's look) Shut. Up. Just then, Harry stumbles into the corridor in his Hospital \nZ \nGown, pretty out of it. \nHARRY \nGirls... .my Doctor, Julian Mercer. (then) Honey, did you bring the CDs? Kim hands Harry a shopping bag full of CDs. \nHARRY \n(to Julian) These are for you... (to the Girls) The man loves Hip Hop. \nJULIAN \n(checking out the bag) Maybe not this much but... \nHARRY \nAnd did you bring the other thing? Lexi hands Harry another bag. Harry reaches in and pulls out a small leather box, hands it to Julian. \nHARRY \nThis is just to thank you for your brilliance the other night. I hope it suits you. \nJULIAN \n(opening the box) Wow. This is.. .Jesus, this is the most gorgeous watch I've ever seen. \nHARRY \n- Oh, good. It's a Piaget. (to Girls) He likes it. \nJULIAN \nNo, I love it and this is incredibly generous of you but I can't accept it. \nHARRY \nYou save my life and you end up with some CDs? \nJULIAN \nNo, I end up seeing you walk out of here and I do get paid you know - \nMARIN (O.S.) \n-- Knock, knock. \nT \nhey all turn, see Marin at the door. She waves to Harry, more reserved than normal. \nJULIAN \nHarry, I'll see you on the way out. \nLOWELL \n(whispers) We'll pull up the car. Everyone EXITS leaving Marin and Harry alone. Harry sits on the bed. Marin joins him. Harry places his hand on her thigh. All she notices is his hospital bracelet. \nHARRY \nSo, I'm some great date, huh? \nMARIN \nYeah... Mr. Excitement. \nHARRY \nTell me somethin', we haven't actually had sex yet, have we? \nMARIN \nNo we haven't. You're correct on that one. \nHARRY \nSomething to live for. Marin smiles, kisses Harry on the cheek. \nHARRY \nDown to the cheek. (that's big, he digests that one) Come on, let's get outta here. \nEXT. SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL - DAY \nHarry is wheeled out in a wheelchair, Marin and a Nurse on either side. In the parking lot is a Town Car with Lowell and the Girls standing next to it. Next to them is Erica, waiting by her car. She's on her cell phone. Harry spots them and tries to get out of the wheel chair before it stops. \nNURSE \nHold on Tarzan, we're still movin' ... (she stops) Okay, now slow-ly. To prove her wrong, Harry rises quickly. Everyone stands by, ready to help. \nHARRY \nLook at these faces. Will you tell them I'm fine. As soon as Harry spots Erica, he starts to wobble. \nERICA \nWhoa! Whoa! WHOA! Everyone grabs for Harry as he FALLS OUT OF FRAME AND THE \nSCREEN GOES BLACK. \nCLOSE ON JULIAN \ntaking Harry's pulse as Harry lies on the ASPHALT OF THE HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. Lowell, the Two Assistants and Marin huddle around. Erica steps back a bit. \nJULIAN \nHarry, I'm sorry, but I think we jumped the gun.. .can't let you travel quite yet. \nHARRY \nI ain't goin' back in there. \nJULIAN \nYou don't have to but I can't put you in a car right now and I can't leave you in the parking lot. I'd like you to stay nearby for a few days and let me keep an eye on you 'til you get your strength back. \nHARRY \nDoc, I'm out in the middle of the Hamptons. Where do you want me to go? Marin turns to Erica who very clearly mouths, \"FORGET IT!\" \nEXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY. \nThe Town Car sits in the driveway, Lexi leans on the hood, talking on her cell. A Market Delivery Van pulls away as a Drugstore Delivery Van pulls in. A Flower Delivery KID holding a large bouquet, knocks at the front door. \nI \nNT. THE GUEST BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nHarry sits up in bed wearing silk pajamas, holding an unlit cigar, and is on the phone. Zoe enters, placing the new bouquet on the already flower filled dresser. Lowell lifts a LUNCH TRAY off the bed as Kim stands nearby on the cell phone. Marin packs her bag. \nHARRY \n(into phone) Just promise me you won't make a decision until we talk. Thinking about it ain't promising me. Okay, man, I'm seein' you Friday... (hangs up, then to Lowell) Lowell, what was that? \nLOWELL \n(looking down at the Tray) Your lunch. \nHARRY \nERICA (O.S.) \nBack here??? \nHARRY \nI-I got confused..! It was dark. I didn't really see anything. Just your tits and a little of your- Erica SLAMS HER DOOR. Photos on the wall shake. \nHARRY \nThis is gonna be murder. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING \nA very wide MIDDLE AGED NURSE gruffly crosses thru the room toward the Front Door. Just as she opens the door, Erica ENTERS in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck, long skirt. Pretty much no skin is showing whatsoever. She carries a few packages. \nNURSE \nGood bye Mrs. Barry. \nERICA \nGood bye? You're leaving? That's not good. \nNURSE \nBeen fired. \nERICA \nFired?   You just started. \nHARRY \nNot fired darlin'. Just not needed. Erica hardly looks at You Know Who who appears to be fresh out of the shower, wet hair, silk robe, bare chest and legs. \nERICA \nWhat do you mean, not needed? Of course we need her. She's gonna take care of you and feed you and... \nHARRY \n-- No, no, I'm actually feeling pretty perky today. Making quite a recovery. . . (opening the screen door) Sorry for the trouble Mrs. Gimble... Take care, dear. Harry hands her a wad of bills like she's a Maitre'd. Mrs. Gimble gives Erica a look of pity as she exits. Erica, now alone with Harry, self-consciously adjusts her sunglasses. Harry, on the other hand, slips his hand onto his bare chest, pats it. \nHARRY \nListen, about last night. \nERICA \nYeah. How 'bout we never talk about that? (hands him some pills) I was at the drugstore. Your prescriptions were ready. They said take these two with food and this one without. \nHARRY \nHonestly, you were in silhouette. \nERICA \nI think that's talkin' about it. \nHARRY \nI really didn't see all that much. \nERICA \n(heading toward her room) Yip. There you go. \nHARRY \nOkay. Won't mention it again but... \nERICA \n(almost out of the room) Goin' to work, Harry. \nHARRY \n(yells) You saw my ass, you don't see me acting nuts, wearing hats and glasses and weird get ups... The Sound of a DOOR SLAM. - Harry flinches. \nINT. HARRY'S BEDROOM \nHarry and Julian sit on the bed. Julian takes Harry's blood pressure. \nHARRY \nYes or no. What's the deal, can I go? \nJULIAN \nYou still getting dizzy? \nHARRY \nNot as much. \nJULIAN \nOut of breath? \nHARRY \nOnly sometimes. \nJULIAN \n(listens with stethoscope) How's Erica treating you? \nHARRY \nWho? \nJULIAN \n(nods toward Living Room) Erica. . . \nHARRY \nHer? Oh, she's a major piece of work. The woman wears turtlenecks in the middle of the summer. \nHARRY (CONT'D) \nShe's beyond uptight. Almost makes her fun to be around. \nJULIAN \nUptight? That's funny. I haven't noticed that. \nHARRY \nTry livin' with her. Julian takes Harry's pulse. \nHARRY \n(with secret glee) I actually saw her naked last night. \nJULIAN \n(yells, warning-like) I'm Walking Around The house! ERICA Laughs. Even she knows this is funny. Harry arrives at her open doorway, timidly pokes his head in. \nERICA \nListen, I've decided to get over the whole \"you saw me naked\" thing. So, we don't have to deal with it anymore. Okay? \nHARRY \nGood, 'cause I've been hiding from you all day. \nERICA \nI know. You want to come in? \nHARRY \nI don't want to break your rhythm or anything. \nERICA \nThat would be wishful thinking. Harry ENTERS cautiously and curiously. \nHARRY \nBeautiful painting. So I'm gonna venture out there and go for a short walk... \nERICA \nYou up to that? \nHARRY \nMy doctor recommended it. I gotta build up to stairs and stuff like that. You wouldn't want to join me? \nERICA \nThat means you don't want me to? \nHARRY \nNo, I was asking if you wanted to. \nERICA \nOh, well, I would but...I don't usually like to break once I've started writing so I probably shouldn't, not that a little fresh air would hurt but... \nHARRY \nIt's just a walk Erica, not a marriage proposal. \nERICA \nYou know my name. \nHARRY \nErica Jane Barry. I looked you up on the internet. \nEXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER - LATE .IN THE DAY \nErica and Harry walk by the water's edge. They are the only two people on the beach. \nHARRY \n-- Did you know there are over eight thousand websites that mention you? \nERICA \nThat can't be possible. \nHARRY \nNo, it's true. I know everything about you now. And not because of last night, but... \nE \nRICA \nYeah, I understood. I actually looked you up too. You grew up in L.A., which I thought nobody did. \nERICA (CONT'D) \nYou were the road manager for a group I sorta never heard of, started your own record label at 29, sold it at 45, then started buying and selling boutique companies then invested in a small record company which you turned into the 2nd largest Hip Hop label in the world. \nHARRY \nIt's exhausting just hearing about it. \nERICA \nI know, but the truth is, it goes fast doesn't it? \nHARRY \nLike the blink of an eye. Erica bends down and picks up A FLAT WHITE STONE, then another and another... \nHARRY \nI noticed you have bowls of those all over your house. \nERICA \nI know, I'm crazy, I just think they're so beautiful... \nHARRY \nBut why do you only pick up the white ones? \nERICA \nI don't only pick up the white ones. \nHARRY \nOh, so you really are crazy. \nERICA \nI pick up only the white ones? (looks in her hand) Oh, God, what does that mean? I'm controlling, unadventurous, what? \nHARRY \nSo you're as hard on yourself as you are on everyone else. Erica is stunned that he caught on to that. Harry bends down, picks up a BROWN stone, places it in her palm among the white stones. \nHARRY \nSomething to remember me by. \nErica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all. \nERICA \nSo can I ask you something Harry? What's with all the young girls? I mean, what's the story there, really? \nHARRY \nI just like to travel light. \nHARRY \n(quickly) I don't think so. I'm not excited about anything. Erica shifts, the hem of her skirt RISING even higher. \nJULIAN \nThere it goes again. Racing. \nHARRY \nDoc... Impossible! Erica rises, leaving Harry's eye-line. \nJULIAN \nOh, there we go, now I feel better. Back to normal. Harry winces then rises, looks to Erica as she throws a pashmina over her shoulders in SLOW MOTION. Harry rushes them \nOUT THE DOOR. \nHARRY \nOkay, all right, good, have fun, don't rush back for me and don't do anything I wouldn't do. \nERICA \nWell that wouldn't leave us too many options would it? \nHARRY \nAnd do we wonder how she writes that snappy repartee. (whispers to Erica) Let him pick up the check. It'll make him feel older. On Erica's shocked expression, the DOOR SLAMS. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT - A BEN WEBSTER CD PLAYS \nHarry lies on the sofa. CAMERA MOVES UP Harry's body, past the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to \nM \nhis face. As the CAMERA moves we HEAR: \nARIN (O.S.) \nHi, it's Marin, I'm not in so leave a message and I'll call you back. \nHARRY \nHey, it's me...just sitting around looking at your baby pictures... Thinking about you... \nHe hangs up, dials another number. \nANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) \nHi and HI, you've reached Brooke and Shannon. For Brooke push one, for - Harry hangs up then slowly sits up, letting himself feel as funky as he wants. \nHARRY \nEverybody's out but old Har.. .Old, old old old Har... Harry rises dizzily, crosses to the bookshelves. He rummages around, finds ERICA'S SCRAPBOOK, pulls it out, randomly opens it, finds a photo of Erica in the 70's, wearing a turtleneck. Harry smiles. \nINT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nHarry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. He notices a bowl filled with white beach stones. Harry's brown stone sits at the top of the pile. \nHARRY \n(complimented) Top of the heap... \nCLOSE ON JULIAN \nStaring at Erica. He can't get enough of her. They're in a ROMANTIC SEASIDE RESTAURANT. And Erica's blushing for the first time in twenty-five years. \nERICA \n-- So, when the land came up, I snatched it and the house was built in record time and... (blushing to death) It's like a thousand degrees in here. \nJULIAN \nYou know, they say doctors fall for people who need rescuing, that we have a need to take care of someone. \nERICA \nReally? I never heard that one. (starts fanning herself with the menu) Julian, how old are you, like... \nJULIAN \n-- Thirty-three. \nERICA \nThirty-three.-Okay, so, I'm twenty years older than you. More than twenty years older than you. \nJULIAN \nYou look fabulous. \nERICA \nThank you   but you know, I'm not sure where you   were headed with that thing you were just   saying, but in terms of us, you just want   to be friends, right? \nJULIAN \nHonestly? No. \nERICA \nWell, then, what is it that you... want to be? \nJ \nULIAN \nI think I'd embarrass you if I told you. \nERICA \nI was embarrassed just getting dressed to see you. \nJULIAN \nThis may surprise you but some women consider me quite the guy. I've never been married. I'm a doctor. You wouldn't believe what catnip that is for some women. \nERICA \nOh yes I would. But, you don't like girls your own age? \nJULIAN \nI do very much. But I've never met one I've taken to quite like this and when something happens to you that's never happened to you before, don't you have to at least find out what it is? \nERICA \nI suppose but, see, I don't date all that much or all that well... \nJULIAN \nOh, come on, you must beat them away with a stick. \nERICA \nNow you're kidding, right? No, guys my age, the ones I've met...well, I'm not that regular a person and they really like regular. \nHARRY \nOkay. \nERICA \nI mean, if you had an opinion, I'd be curious but...' \nHARRY \nwill you tell me first why you only miss being married at night? \nERICA \n(cracking eggs) Oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much at night and the \"alone\" thing happens at night and sleeping by myself took some getting used to. But I got the hang of it. You gotta sleep in the middle of the bed. It's absolutely not healthy to have a side when no one has the other side. She starts mixing the batter. \nHARRY \nOkay, now I'm convinced what I think of you is right. (Erica waits. . . ) You are a tower of strength. \nERICA \n(shoulders sagging) Ughhhhhhhhhh... . \nHARRY \nTry not to rate my answer. \nERICA \nI'm sorry. It's just...I'm sorry. \nHARRY \nYou're like a thoroughbred in a world of mutts. No, you know what you are, you're like a great portrait over a fireplace. Words have been invented to describe women like you. \nERICA \n( fearful) Such as? \nHARRY \nFlinty   and...Impervious. \nERICA \nSo you think I'm inhuman. \nHARRY \nNo. I think you're formidable. \nERICA \nBut cold and distant. Like I'm frozen in some painting... \nHARRY \nNot at all. I think you're strength defines you. (sees how sensitive she is) But it's thrilling when your defenses are down arid you're not isolated. That, I believe, is your winning combo. A killer combo actually. \nERICA \n... So I can't decide if you hate me or if maybe you're the only person who ever got me. \nHARRY \nI don't hate you. The moment is broken when they HEAR the FRONT DOOR OPEN and \nHIGH HEELS APPROACHING. \nERICA \nHello? Marin ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY in a knockout of a dress holding a bag from Zabars. She looks fresh, vibrant, sexy. \nMARIN \nRoom service! \nERICA \nWhat are you doing here at this hour? \nErica and Harry have the air of kids caught making out by one of their parents. Harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths down his hair. Erica catches all this. \nMARIN \n(enters, kisses Erica) \nI \nhad this big photography auction tonight, then I went out with a bunch of people, I checked my messages and got this so sad message from Harry so bored out here. I thought I should come out and at least see how he was doing. (kisses Harry on the cheek) Thank you for the gorgeous flowers by the way. They were so huge... Erica nods to herself. Oh, God, he sends them all flowers. Harry notes Erica's reaction. \nMARIN \nSo how are you guys? (sets down the Zabar's bag) Oh, this is too sweet. You're making pancakes? Awwww. And you're both in your pj's. Now I feel I'm interrupting. \nERICA \nDon't be silly. You know I never sleep and this one doesn't sleep either. It's... .What's in the bag? \nMARIN \n(reaches into the bag) A quart of matzoh ball soup for Harry. I know it's not the remedy for heart problems but it is low cholesterol. \nERICA \n(hating to correct her) But high sodium. \nMARIN \nOh, sorry. Stupid. For Mom, your favorite raisin-bread. And for me... (reaches into the bag) My favorite Vodka. Marin's cell phone RINGS. \nMARIN \n(into phone) Hello? No I'm here, babe. Made record time. Everyone's still there? Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair. Harry watches her. She catches him and shrugs. Marin flips her phone shut and tosses it in her purse. \nERICA \nSo, Mar, now that you're here, why don't you finish the pancakes and I'll get back to work... \nMARIN \nMom! I just got here, hold on. She pours a healthy Vodka into a glass, grabs some ice. \nMARIN \nSo your ex-husband stood me up today. We were supposed to have lunch at Barneys . He never showed up. Was he always like this? \nERICA \nHoney, I don't know... \nMARIN \nThis is what happens after a couple gets divorced, the kid inherits all the problems. Not that I'm a kid. (then to Harry, the flirt in her coming back) So how are you, how do you feel? When can you go home? Just as harry is about to answer, Marin's cell RINGS. She picks it up, looks at her caller ID, throws it back in her bag. \nERICA \nERICA \n(into the phone) Hello. \nHARRY \n(from the beach) Thought you'd like to know your daughter broke up with me. Harry and Erica talk while looking at each other through the Kitchen Window. \nERICA \nI heard. \nHARRY \nMade up a story about meeting another guy. Guess I wasn't so cute with an IV in my arm. \nERICA \nNo, I think she really did meet someone else. \nHARRY \nHey, it's alright. Her mother didn't like me anyway. \nERICA \n(smiles) How 'bout I bring you out some lunch and a couple of blood \nH \npressure pills? \nARRY \nYou're a great woman, Erica. (Erica relaxes) Is this why my doctor is falling in love with you? \nTHE BEACH - MUSIC OVER \nErica and Harry sit on a blanket on a cloudy day having a picnic lunch. Harry is telling Erica a story and she screams with laughter. \nBROWN STONES IN THE SAND - MUSIC CONTINUES \nErica picks them up as.she walks with Harry by the water's edge. They talk non-stop. \nA LITTLE LATER - LIGHTNING STREAKS THE SKY \nOut of nowhere, a downpour. Erica and Harry gather their picnic things. The blanket starts to fly and Harry grabs it as Erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nErica and Harry, wet from the rain, quickly shut all the doors and windows. Lightning crackles across the sky and THE \nLIGHTS IN THE HOUSE GO OUT. \nA MATCH IS STRUCK \nand a CANDLE is lit. Then ANOTHER ONE, and ANOTHER ONE. Erica turns and finds Harry just looking at her. Before either of them has time to think, they kiss. \nERICA \nI'm sorry. \nHARRY \n(truly confused) For what? \nERICA \nI just kissed you. \nHARRY \nNo, honey, I kissed you. Relieyed, Erica kisses him. \nERICA \nI know that one was me. \nHARRY \nTry not to keep score. He kisses her again and again. \nHARRY \nSoft lips... \nERICA \nI'm so glad they still work. I haven't used them for kissing in so long. They've been more like for wearing lipstick and whistling and... He kisses her quiet. Relieved, she finally fully kisses him back. A big gorgeo~s kiss. \nHARRY \nWell, well, now look who's got something that works... They both look down at Harry. Hello, Mr. Midnight. \nERICA \nAnd you didn't even take Via- \nHARRY \n(puts his finger on her lips) Kiss me before you make it go away. \nS \nhe kisses him long and sweet. \nERICA'S BED \nThey're kissing on it. The rain pelts against the windows as the sun goes down. \nHARRY \nThis could be world class interesting. (Erica nods) Having any doubts? \nERICA \n(as they kiss) Yes. \nHARRY \nMe too. \nERICA \nBut so far the kissing is spectacular. (He looks at her) I'm not grading you, just mentioning it. Brilliant. He tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way. He pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get to her. \nHARRY \nCan't get past your damn turtleneck. . . He tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he doesn't want to be down there yet. He comes back up when Erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer, takes out a SCISSORS and hands it to him. \nERICA \n(breathless) Cut it off... Please. What a brilliant invitation. He takes the scissors and starts cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso, between her breasts. The turtleneck falls open from the center. When he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and it easily rips apart and there she is. He takes her in. \nHARRY \nYou're beautiful. She shakes her head, 'no' ...shuts her eyes. \nMARIN \nWhat do you mean, it's like a hurricane. The news said the winds are like a zillion miles an hour. \nERICA \nOh, that. Oh, no, we're fine... \nMARIN \nAre you having sex? Tell the truth. You are, aren't you. \nERICA \nAbsolutely not. No. That is not going on now. \nMARIN \nOh my God, you already did it. Was it amazing? \nERICA \nI have to go. \nMARIN \nJust tell me, was it amazing? \nERICA \nYes and thank you for the wonderful opportunity. Marin SCREAMMMMMMMMMMMS. Erica flips the phone shut, looks to Harry, embarassed. \nERICA \n(to Harry) Am I interested in buying aluminum siding. . . \nHARRY \nReally? Marin's selling aluminum siding? Erica buries her face in his chest. \nLATER \nHarry and Erica SIT ON STOOLS AT THE KITCHEN ISLAND, drinking wine and eating scrambled eggs right out of the pan. Candles light the room. \nHARRY \n--But why Paris? \nERICA \nI just always wanted to write a play that ended there. \nERICA (CONT'D) \nPeople need romance like that. And if someone like me doesn't write it, where they gonna get it? Real life? \nHARRY \n(slightly insulted) Excuse me. What do you call this? Eating eggs by candlelight in our robes after... She kisses him, starts to say, \"I'm sorry\" when he pulls her back, kisses her again, then looks at her hard, perplexed. \nCLIMBING BACK UNDER THE COVERS \nHARRY \nSo where do you like to eat in Paris?    E \nRICA \nOh, I love this place called Le Balzar, it's just a little bistro on the Left Bank, best roast chicken in the universe. \nHARRY \nYou'd be fun to go to Paris with. \nERICA \nIt's a great city to stay up all night in. (then) When's your birthday? \nHARRY \nFebruary. \nERICA \nMine's in January. So, how 'bout if we still know each other by then we go to Paris for our birthdays. \nHARRY \n(a beat, then) Maybe. . . \nERICA \nOh. Sorry. You just... (sees the look on his face) . I have no idea how to do this...be intimate but not...The color is draining from your face. Okay, look, I'm gonna pee,take one of your blood pressure pills then when I get back, let's not talk anymore. \nShe gets out of bed. \nHARRY \nYou're the funniest girl I ever had sex with. She has no idea how to take that. Decides to accept it. \nERICA \nThat's somethin'... \nHARRY \nHoney... ? She turns, sees he's getting out of bed, approaching her. \nHARRY \nI think I'm gonna go back to my room...let you sleep. \nERICA \nLet me sleep? Oh, right...you usually send the girls home. . .but I am home... so...okay. \nHARRY \nI'm an old dog, you' know. \nERICA \nHey, it's perfectly. .. whatever. Good night. This was..This was a great night. For me... \nHARRY \nMe too. At one point I even thought soul mates, you know... Erica nods. She knows. \nHARRY FLOPS ONTO HIS BED \nstares straight up at the ceiling. \nINT. ERICA'S ROOM - SAME TIME \nErica gets back in her bed. She lies there for a second,securing her armor back in place. She routinely moves to the middle of the bed,neatens out the covers and shuts her eyes. Then a small KNOCK on her open door. She sees Harry in the doorway. \nHARRY \nYeah and totally changing their tastes. Like suddenly really liking something they never thought they could like...ever...and I'm talking really liking it. It's...unnerving. \nJULIAN \nI think you can expect just about anything right now. People have done some wild things after having a heart attack...selling businesses, getting divorced, moving... Some people say it saved their lives. \nHARRY \nBut most people go back to being themselves, right? I'll go back to being me, won't I? \nJ \nULIAN \nWe'll see. \nERICA - TYPING - HER PHONE RINGS \nShe wears a blouse with more buttons unbuttoned than ever in her life. She picks up the phone. \nHARRY DRIVES ERICA'S CAR, TOP DOWN. \nHARRY \n(on his cell) Hi. \nERICA \nHey.    What'd he say? \nHARRY \nHe said you're wonderful. \nERICA \nNo, really, what'd he say...How are you? \nHARRY \nHe said I'm good..that I can go. \n. ERICA \n(obviously conflicted) Oh. So... Congratulations. That's really. . . great. \nHARRY \nYeah, he said... by tomorrow for absolute sure. You think you can deal with me for one more night? \nA CROWDED CLUB - SOUTHAMPTON - THAT NIGHT \nPacked with Young People. In the middle of this twentysomething sun burnt beach crowd, we find, Erica and Harry, the two coolest people in the room, dancing with each other. \nA LITTLE 'LATER - THE KARAOKE ROOM \nHarry leads Erica through a crowd listening to a Girl singing Britney Spears' Oops, I Did It Again. When she finishes the crowd enthusiastically applauds. \nHARRY \n(big breath) Okay, here goes... \nERICA \nHere goes what? \nHARRY \nHere goes me singing to you... (pulling a DISC out of his pocket) Bought my own music. \nERICA \nYou knew they had karaoke? \nHARRY \nBaby, it's why we're here. . Harry makes his way TO THE STAGE, hands them his disc. He's handed a microphone. He looks right at Erica. \nHARRY \nThis is for you, Ace... (then, under his breath) wish me luck. The Music begins and it is an instrumental version of one of Erica's French Songs, \"I Wish You Love\". \nHARRY \n(sings) I wish you bluebirds in the spring... To Give your heart a song to sing... And then a kiss, but more than this... I wish H         you love... arry takes out a sheet of paper and his glasses. \nHARRY \nDon't want to blow this part... Now Harry sings the rest of the song IN FRENCH. . . \nHARRY \n(sings) Et en juillet une limonade...Pour vous refroidir dans quelque lefy glade... And so on... Erica watches knowing something in her life has just that second, forever changed. And as Harry continues singing, we: \nCUT TO: \nLOWELL - THE NEXT DAY \nPacking the Trunk of the Town Car in front of Erica's house. \nINT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME \nHarry tosses his pills in a leather bag. .. Erica enters doing the worst job she's ever done of being strong. \nERICA \n(holding some cigars) Here you go, you can have these back now. (Harry looks confused) I confiscated them your first night here... \nHARRY \n(smells them) Thank you darlin' ... \nERICA \nTry not to smoke them... (hands him a small bag) And I packed you a sandwich, just in case your blood sugar got low. And some of that iced-tea you like, and a nonfat, low cholesterol cookie. And a peach. \nHARRY \nwhat a doll... (notices) Got something else? From behind her back Erica pulls out a Mason Jar filled with all dark beach stones with ONE WHITE STONE in the center. \nERICA \nSomething to remember me by. Harry hugs her. Erica awkwardly throws her arms around him and kisses him, then kisses him better. He's moved by her. \nHARRY \nThere is that... \nERICA \nAnd hey, we'll always have Paris. \nHARRY \nHoney, no words can ever express my gratitude for taking me in and taking care of me and... \nERICA \nI have never lied to you. I have always told you some version of the truth. \nERICA \n(freaking on that one) The truth doesn't have versions. \nHARRY \nCan you cut me a little slack? My life's been turned upside down. \nERICA \nYeah. Mine too. \nHARRY \nThen let's each get our bearings. \nERICA \nI don't want my bearings. I've had my bearings my whole fucking life. I felt something with you that... Oh, you don't want to- \nHARRY \nYes I do. (she won't open up) Tell me. \nERICA \nI felt something with you, I didn't know really existed. You know what that's like after a twenty year marriage? To feel something for another person that's so off the charts, that - (Harry looks down) Okay, not your problem. This is why I'm not good in relationships. You know writers are like teachers, those who can - do, those who can't - write romantic comedies where THIS does not happen in the third act...and it certainly does not happen to a 55 year old woman. In the play I'll be 36 so it won't be as pathetic. I'm just too old to feel crushed.I've written this feeling but I never really got it. (realizes) You know what this is? (pointing to herself) This is heart broken. How's that for impervious? \nHARRY \nYou're killin' me. \nERICA \nI just wish it had lasted more than a week. \nHARRY \nMe too. \nERICA \nThat's a horrible thing to say. (walks off, comes back) The life I had before I met you. I knew how to do that, could do that forever. Now look at me...what do I do with all this? \nHARRY \nCan we talk tomorrow? \nERICA \nWhat for? I saw your friend you were having dinner with, if that's what you want, it's never going to work with me. Look at me. I'm a middle aged woman, don't let this brown hair fool you, I don't have a real brown hair on my head, I'm almost all grey...that would freak you out, wouldn't it? And I have. high cholesterol and my back hurts every morning and I'm post menopausal and I have osteoperosis and I'm sure arthritis is just around the corner and I know you've seen my vericose veins. Let's face it man, that's not quite the buzz you're lookin' for. A TAXI pulls up. \nERICA \nAnd you know what? Everyday, I'm gettin' older. ..just like you. Erica opens the back door of the Taxi. \nHARRY \nWait. Erica turns. This is his chance. \nHARRY \nI just... the truth is... I don't know how to be a boyfriend. \nERICA \nThat's what you have to say after all this? You don't know how to be a boyfriend. \nHARRY \nThat's not a small thing. They're both out of words. \nERICA \nAre we done? \nHARRY \nI don't know. She nods. He doesn't give. She ducks into the CAB and it PULLS AWAY. Harry stands on the street, watching her go. \nHARRY \n(winces) Ouch. He grabs his heart. \nHARRY \nOh, God... \nHARRY - ON A GURNEY \nwheeled through the Emergency Room of Beth Israel Hospital. This is not the Hamptons. This place is crawling with patients. Harry's delivered to a Latina Doctor in her thirties, DR. MARTINEZ. As he's taken off the gurney, he's immediately hooked up to a heart monitor, given oxygen and an \nIV. \nNURSE \nCame in by cab, 15 minutes of chest pain, no nauseau, some shortness of breath, was hospitalized a week ago with a coronary thrombosis. \nDR. MARTINEZ \nHang a nitro drip. \nHARRY \nYou can't. I took Viagra. \nDR. MARTIINEZ \nYou have been through this before. Give him 5 mgs of Metoprolol. You h~ving chest pain right now? \nH \nARRY \nNo, and the pain I was having was sharp, not like before. \n. DR. MARTINEZ \nThat's good. Not like before is we like to hear. (reads EKG) Give him aspirin. \nDR. MARTINEZ (CONT'D) \nBased   on what I see so far, your heart   is not in distress but I'm gonna   do a rapid enzyme test to be sure.    What were you doing at the onset   of the pain? \nHARRY \nHaving a fight with someone. A woman. Can a woman give you chest pain? \nDR. MARTINEZ \nAre you kidding? Love hurts, haven't you heard? \nHARRY \nYeah, but so far, I've only given pain, I never got any. \nLOWELL \nYes but you gave them to me, you said you never wore them. \nHARRY \nI know. But why would I do that? They're so elegant. Nice piping... \nLOWELL \nMr. Langer, you're always giving away beautiful things. \nHARRY \nAwwwww... How did I get like this? (eyes fluttering shut) I'm gonna shut my eyes for a few minutes. Keep Lucy on... Harry nods off and Lowell TURNS OUT THE LIGHT. \nEXT. BEACH - THE HAMPTONS - MORNING - MUSIC OVER \nErica and Zoe are taking a walk. Erica, still crying, picks up a brown stone, explains its meaning to Zoe. Zoe holds the stone, makes an `awwww' face.Erica nods, then Zoe tosses the stone in the ocean, fed up with hearing about him already. Then, Zoe stops Erica, points to something. \nMARIN AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND \nfrolicking on the beach. He's a YOUNG HUNK in a tank top, shorts, highlighted hair. Erica rolls her eyes. \nEXT. BEACH STAIRS - DUSK \nMarin rushes down the stairs. Erica sits near the bottom of the stairs, watching the sunset. \nMARIN \nMom, we're going into town... Erica turns, wiping tears. \nMARIN \nAre you crying? (joining her) I didn't know you did that. \nERICA \nYeah, it's my new thing. I've gotten abnormally great at it. \nMARIN \n(sitting on the step with her) Is it Harry? \nERICA \nSeems I gotta learn how to do that love 'em and leave 'em stuff. \nMARIN \nFucking men. You don't care when I say fuck, do you? \nERICA \nNot really. Sometimes. Not right now. \nMARIN \nSo now you get my theory about love? You gotta self protect. It's too dangerous. \nERICA \nMarin, that theory... how can I put this so your feelings won't get hurt. It's just so crazy, it makes me want to SCREAMMMMMMMMMMM!!!! \nMARIN \nAnd how would you put it if you wanted to hurt my feelings? \nERICA \nListen to me... you cannot hide from love for the rest of your life because maybe it won't work out and maybe you'll become unglued. That's not a way to live. \nMARIN \nSo you're telling me you're happy right now? This is good what happened to you? \nERICA \nNo. This was bad. But for the three days it was good, it was electrifying. Marin's eyes fill up. \nERICA \nI think you must consider the possibility that we are more alike than you realize. I let someone in and I had the time of my life. \nMARIN \n(tearful) I've never had the time of my life. \nERICA \nI know. And bubbee, I say this from the deepest part of my heart. . ... what the fuck are you waiting \"for? \nINT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NYC - NIGHT \nA PARTY is in progress. It's loud. The place is crawling with characters from the Hip Hop world. Harry winds his way down his crowded STAIRCASE, Girls grabbing at him as he passes by. As hard as he tries, he can't quite bring to life the guy he knew how to be. \nLOWELL \n(as Harry passes) \nH \naving fun? \nHARRY \nNot quite. Harry makes his way down the stairs, through the crowded entry and OUT THE FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE, Harry steps into the QUIET STREET, looks up at his house and the party inside. \nEXT. ROADSIDE FARM STAND - EAST HAMPTON - DAY \nZoe is picking corn, when she notices Julian across the way. He glances up, looks right past her, obviously doesn't remember her, keeps on shopping. Zoe thinks for a see, wondering how she can get his attention when he looks right back at her, his face full of hope. \nINT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - LATER \nErica sets the table for two. Zoe pokes her head in the door. \nZOE \nI got you something great at the farm stand. \nJ \nZoe fully opens the door revealing Julian holding a bouquet of fresh cut flowers. \nJULIAN \nThese are for you to give me when you apologize. \nINT. DINING ROOM - LATER - MUSIC OVER \nCandlelit. Zoe, Erica and Julian share a bottle of wine and a home cooked meal. The CAMERA does a 360 around the table, their faces saying it all. The Women bask in Julian's warmth as he entertains them with stories. Zoe looks from Julian to Erica, relieved to see her sister smiling again. \nINT. KITCHEN - LATER \nErica places coffee cups in the sink. Julian is next to her, leaning against the counter, holding a glass of wine. \nERICA \nHARRY \nWhat are you leaning towards? \nERICA \nDeath. (Harry reacts) It's funnier. \nHARRY \nHe dies of a funny heart attack? \nERICA \nHe's sort of a schmuck who screwed around with our heroine, so it won't be too sad. \nHARRY \nSchmucks are people too you know. Death doesn't seem a little harsh? \nERICA \nI just went where the story took me. It's a work of fiction, Harry. Really...just stuff I made up. \nSTAGE MANAGER \n(approaching) Erica, we're ready to do the hospital, 'Do You Take Viagra scene... Should we wait for you? \nErica nods, horrified. \nHARRY \nSo I'm going to be the laughing stock of Broadway. \nERICA \nHarry, he's not you. He's a version of the truth of you. So to speak. \nSTAGE MANAGER \nSorry to interrupt again but Dave wants to know, when Henry says, \"I love ya\", you want that to be 'Ya', not 'You', right? \nERICA \nRight. We now HEAR Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose play throughout the theater. The BEACH backing is 'raised and an EIFFEL TOWER BACKING is lowered behind them. They both try to ignore the music, but it's impossible. \nE \nRICA \nWell, you look really nice. You feeling all right? As they stand in front of the Eiffel Tower backing, FAKE SNOW FALLS from above... \nHARRY \nYou know it isn't like I wanted to stop seeing you. We could've carried on a fun thing for awhile. Why is it you dames want all or nothing? \nERICA \nI don't know, we're just goofy when it comes to love... Look, Harry, if it's all right with you, I'd like to be friends \nHARRY \nI'm not ready to be your friend. How's that? \nERICA \nFine. I understand. \nHARRY \nAnyway, do you actually buy that horse shit.. .that men and women can be friends once they've had sex? \nERICA \nI'm friends with my ex-husband, but then again, we didn't just have sex. \nHARRY \nWe didn't just have sex either. \nERICA \nThen what was it? Love to know. \nHARRY \nCan I e-mail it to you when I figure it out? (laughs) This is perfect. I have given the `Can't We Be friends' speech for 40 years. I think I invented the 'Can't We Be Friends' speech. But you know what,now I get why they never went for it. You dames got one thing right. Sometimes sex does change everything. Call me crazy, but I just don't see us out on the town, being pals, having dinner, 'cause I'd bet you anything, at some point, one of us will have very unfriend like thoughts about the other then pass the bread becomes anything but pass the bread. You get what I'm saying? \nERICA \nYou don't want to be friends. \nHARRY \nNot \"don't\". Can't. Can't be friends. Doesn't work that way. (tries to calm down) Okay, I'm moving into another phase of this thing. I'm mad at you. (realizes) It almost feels good. \nERICA \nI think I'm mad at you too. \nHARRY \nExcellent. 'Cause I don't like thinking about you so much and worrying about how you are and if I ruined your life or... \nERICA \n-- You've worried about me? \nHARRY \nYes honey, the schmuck who deserves to die, worries about you. \nHARRY(cont'd) Sometimes worrying about you feels like a full time job. \nERICA \nWell, doll, I'm doing fine. So you don't have to work that shift anymore. Again, The Stage Manager... \nSTAGE MANAGER \nErica, they want you to take a look at the costumes for the dancing Henry's. These gonna work for you? Harry and Erica TURN and SEE a CHORUS LINE of BALDING 60 YEAR \nOLD MEN IN HOSPITAL GOWNS AND SOCKS. \nEXT. THEATER - DAY \nHarry FLIES OUT the Stage Door, right into the street, is almost hit by a motorcycle, doesn't seem to care. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY \nHarry walks briskly through the park, still pissed, his pace starting to get to him. He spots a bench with a WOMAN JOGGER at one end. He parks himself at the other end of the bench, out of breath. Tries H reason with himself. to \nARRY \nGod is a woman, I know that now. No man would punish me like this. \nWOMAN JOGGER \nA Woman In Her Fifties, purposively walks down a SMALL TOWN MAIN STREET carrying groceries. \nHarry, at her side, keeps talking at her, even though she picks up her pace and ignores him. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nMy losing streak finally ended when I got one to open up to me. In a HOSPITAL ROOM, an Older Woman on life support, scrawls out a note and shows it to Harry who sits in a chair by herside. A Priest stands in the background. The note says, \"As I remember it, you were wildly insensitive\". Harry lowers his head in shame. She places another note in front of him. It says, \"I forgive you.\" Relieved, he smiles. Then, one last note: \"Now, scram.\" \nHARRY (V.O.) \nHearing what they had to say was no picnic. In an Upper West Side COFFEE SHOP, Harry pas coffee with a Woman in her Mid Forties. She talks his ear off. Harry can' t deal with it. He looks away ~ The woman places her hand on his chin and pulls him right back to her and keeps talking at him. \nH \nARRY (V .O.) \nBut I stuck it out and I listened. Then I listened harder. Harry WALKS down THE STREET with a ANOTHER WOMAN in her Thirties, who carries a cello.   She never shuts up. \nHARRY (V. O. ) \nAnd one of the things I realized was, I was actually giving closure to generations of women. At the corner, the Woman hugs Harry goodbye. \nHARRY (V. O. ) \nAlthough I admit, some refused to give, no matter what I did. . . \nCLOSE - DIANE SAWYER \nOn the set of GOOD MORNING AMERICA. She glances out the STUDIO WINDOW and sees Harry ON THE STREET among the folks holding signs. He HOLDS A SIGN that says, \"DIANE, YOU WERE RIGHT.   I WAS ENTIRELY WRONG.   I`M SORRY.\"   She looks him straight in the eye and gives 'him the finger. \nHARRY - FULLY DRESSED - LYING ON HIS BED - TOP SHOT \nHARRY (V. O. ) \nWhen you hear the same story about yourself over and over, your life begins to make sense and the future becomes your only salvation. \nINT. PARIS BISTRO - THE PRESENT \nHARRY \nIt took me six months to find them all. I visited 18 different states but I came the furthest to see you. A HAND lands on his shoulder and he HEARS: \nA MAN'S VOICE \nI don't believe it. Harry looks up and sees handsome young Julian in a beret. Harry looks to Erica, instantly deflated.. \nHARRY \nMe either. Harry stands. The two Men hug, then Julian squeezes in next to Erica. Harry slowly takes his seat across from them. \nERICA \nI should have told you he was coming, but I was so engrossed in your story. \nJULIAN \nWhat story..? \nHARRY \nOh, maybe another time. ..So... (looks from Erica to Julian, it all dawns on him) I guess I should've seen your play, then I would've Jknown how this ended. \nULIAN \nYeah, big twist, huh? So what are you doing over here, man? \nHARRY \nJust a uh, vacation...never been to Paris in January... \nJULIAN \nIt's amazing to run into you. You look wonderful. \nERICA \nYou do. \nHARRY \nHaven't been on a gurney in six months so that's somethin'... \nJULIAN \nWell, I've just been to every store in the city, this woman is impossible to buy for... But I think I finally found the right gift. He puts what can only be a RING BOX on the table between Erica and Harry. \nJULIAN \nHappy Birthday baby. He kisses her. Harry watches, dying. \nERICA \n(reaching for it) I'll open it later... Harry rises, reaches for his coat. \nHARRY \nNo, no, you know what, I'll let you two celebrate... \nERICA \nHarry, stay. \nHARRY \nI can't really. \nJULIAN \nWhy? You have somewhere to go? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE WAITER POURING THE END OF A WINE BOTTLE \nEveryone at the table is laughing, mid-meal. Julian is doing the talking as well as laughing. Harry laughs along, trying to be an approving part of their romance but he's totally faking it. \nTHREE GLASSES OF BRANDY ARE SERVED - A LITTLE LATER \nJULIAN \n-- To the forces of destiny that brought us together tonight. \nErica lights a cigarette. \nJULIAN \nWhat are you doing, you don't smoke? \nERICA \nI'm in Paris, the second hand smoke will kill you anyway... \nJULIAN \nShe's very brilliant, but the woman can not hold her liquor. Julian puts his arm around her, pulls her close. \nERICA \n", "test1_input": "She never changes... \nERICA \n(setting him straight) Yes. Maybe that's a good thing. \nEXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - SUNSET \nNo cars are out front. Quiet and peaceful. On the Soundtrack we hear the French tune, I wish You Love sung in French. \nINT. ERICA'S KITCHEN - THE SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER \nErica cooks, softly singing along in French. \nHARRY (O.S.) \nSmells great in here. Surprised, Erica turns to find Harry leaning in the doorway in his pajamas, robe and slippers. No one's ever had more gorgeous clothes to sleep in. His presence disarms her. \nERICA \nCoq au Vin... (he looks confused) \nH \nChicken cooked in red wine... \nARRY \nFrench Food... French music... \nERICA \nPart of my play takes place in Paris so I'm hoping this helps me think. I'm hopin'...How you feeling? \nHARRY \nWell, I walked all the way in here, only bumping into two chairs and an ottoman. \nERICA \nEveryone bumps into that ottoman. Harry appreciates the thought. Before it has time to become awkward, the Phone RINGS. \nHARRY \nHey, thanks for letting me... \nERICA \nYeah, no...it's fine. (answering the phone) Hello. Yes, he is. (hands the phone to Harry) \nHARRY \n(into phone) Hello. Hey sweets... (Erica hates this) Oh, you got the flowers? Are they pretty? Erica can't stand this. She puts on her glasses and skims her recipe. \nHARRY \nHey, can I call you in a little bit. What's your number doll? (spots a pad and pencil) Harry squints, can't see what he's writing...backs his head away from the pad. Erica hands him her glasses. \nHARRY \n(slips them on, jots down the number) Okay... Call you in a little. \nHarry hangs up and hands the glasses back to Erica. \nHARRY \nSame prescription... \nERICA \nLook, Harry, it's not like in any stretch of the imagination, I think you're all that right for my daughter but I don't really appreciate hearing you on the phone with other women. It's like I'm an accomplice to you cheating, it's... \nHARRY \nYour daughter knows I see other women. \nERICA \nShe does? I mean, fine, it's none of my business...but... (struggles to open a bottle of wine) \nHARRY \nShe knows I'm not monogamous...We've discussed it. \nERICA \nGreat? And that's what? Why are you proud of that? \nHARRY \nNot proud. Just honest. Your daughter said she likes that about me. (takes the wine and opens it with ease.) \nERICA \nMy daughter is confused when it comes to men. \nHARRY \nI don't blame her. We're confusing. Harry hands her the open wine bottle. \nEXT. BEACH PATIO \nWIDE SHOT - ALMOST NIGHT \nErica and Harry sit not so close together at a long table, under a purple sky. Another French Tune plays. If this wasn't them, this would look romantic. \nN \nothing is said. Just two people eating. Harry lifts the salt shaker, about to add salt to his chicken. \nERICA \nShould I just call the ambulance now? Harry shoots her a look and places the salt shaker back on the table. \nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - OVER - LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S LA VIE EN ROSE \nA starry sky gives the house a storybook setting. We HEAR THE \nPHONE RING. \nINT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC CONTINUES \nErica works at a laptop at a cluttered table. The CLOCK tells us it's a little after ONE A.M. Annoyed by the ringing phone, she points her remote at the CD Player and stops' the song. Harry answers the phone in his room. A moment of quiet. Erica points her remote, starts the song again, starts typing again. Now the other line RINGS. She looks over at the phone watching one RED LIGHT \"BLINK, while the other line is answered. \nERICA \nWhat am I doing? She throws a piece of paper over the phone so she can't see it. She clicks on her AOL ICON and is told: AOL CANNOT CONNECT. LINE BUSY. She's pissed. Then, worse, she SMELLS something. \nINT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nHarry is on the phone, smoking a cigar. His pajama top is unbuttoned, his hair is allover the place. His bed is a mess, laptop open, newspapers spilling onto the floor. Erica stands in the doorway. He quickly hides his cigar. \nHARRY \n(into phone) Can you hold a see, doll? (looks to Erica) Hey. \nERICA \n", "test1_true": "Erica holds out a partially filled water glass for Harry to deposit his cigar in. \nHARRY \nI have a question for you. She waits. She doesn't say anything. \nERICA \nWhat? Do I Hhave to say what? \nARRY \nHave you always been like this or do I bring this out in you? She shakes the water glass, waiting for the deposit. He drops the cigar in. \nHARRY \nI don't think I've ever had this effect on a woman before. \nERICA \n(picking up the newspapers) And what effect do you think you're having on me? \nHARRY \nI don't quite recognize it, that's how I know I've never had it before. Erica rolls her eyes as she finishes cleaning up. \nHARRY \nSo you don't sleep? \nERICA \nI only need about four hours a night. \nHARRY \nMe too. Never slept eight hours in my life. \nERICA \nMe either. I wish I could. ..but... (re: curtains) Want me to shut these, sun comes in pretty strong in the morning. \nHARRY \nSure. . . thanks. . . \nERICA \n(drawing the drapes) Who you talking to at this hour? \nHARRY \nA friend in L.A. It's only ten out there. \nERICA \nAnd that's not past her bedtime? \nHARRY \nSo you don't get more mellow as the hours pass? \nERICA \n(heading out) Good night, Harry. \nHARRY \nCan I ask you one other thing? (Erica turns) What's with the turtlenecks? It's the middle of summer. \nERICA \nNow seriously, why do you care what I wear? \nHARRY \nJust curious. \nERICA \nI like them. I've always liked them. I'm just a turtleneck kinda gal. \nHARRY \nYou ever get hot? \nERICA \nNo. \nHARRY \nNever? \nERICA \nNot lately. \nINT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAlmost TWO. Erica is writing, her eyes go to the phone with the typing paper over it. She LIFTS a corner of the paper, takes a peek. The one lit line GOES OUT. Finally. \"Erica turns off her computer, sits for a second. No one has rattled her cage like this in quite some time. And no, she doesn't like it. She stands, starts to undress. \nANGLE - THE FLOOR \nAs Erica's TURTLENECK lands on it. Then her BRA, then her PANTS then her PANTIES. \nERICA - NAKED - TIGHT SHOT \nShe crosses through the room on her way to the Bathroom. She passes by her partially open door, happens to look out INTO \nTHE HALLWAY AND SEES: \nHARRY - PLANTED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER \nSeeing it all. \nERICA - SCREAMS \nand DROPS OUT OF FRAME. \nHARRY \nflustered, spins around, loses his balance, crashes into the wall, covers his eyes. \nHARRY \nI'm sorry! Oh, God am I sorry. \nERICA (O.S.) \nWhat are you doing?!? \nHARRY \nTrying to find the kitchen! \n", "test1_id": 1425, "test2_input": "Absolutely not. No. \nMARIN \nPlease. He wants me to meet her and I can not go alone. I already asked him if you could come and he said it was fine and she said it was fine. Look, you're gonna have to meet her too, so, we might as well meet her together. Come on, you know you can handle it. \nErica pauses, thinks M about it. She knows she can too. \nARIN \nOkay. That's it. See that look on your face. That's the gene I didn't get. \nINT. SOTHEBY' S - MOMENTS LATER \nMarin, now all pulled together, stands at the podium in front of a packed house. If' you didn't know, you'd never guess. \nMARIN \nGood evening and welcome to Sotheby's and this evening's sale of Impressionistic and Modern Art. Bidders should know that the auctioneer may open bidding on any lot below the reserve by placing a bid on behalf of the seller. Okay...Let's start with Lot I, the Bonnard drawing. And $5.000 starting with my bidders, $5000 is bid, 5500, 6000, 6500 is mine, 7000 gentleman's bid, 7500 is here, 8000 on the phone. . . \nON ERICA \nin the back of the room, watching with pride and worry. She slips out her cell, checks her messages. Her phone lights up and tells her she has \"0\" Voice Mail. \nA CLOCK ON THE WALL - IT'S 8:30 \nWe are in ERICA'S EMPTY KITCHEN in The Hamptons and her phone is RINGING. \nANGLE - A CELL PHONE \nas A Man's HAND turns it off. We are: \nINT. HAMPTON'S RESTAURANT \nJulian sits at a table, by himself, in a coat and tie, tucking away his phone. The Waiter sympathetically approaches the table. \nJULIAN \nGuess I got stood up. \nWAITER \nWould you like to order or...? \nJULIAN \nWhy not, I put. on the tie and everything. And can you bring me another. . . (indicating his drink) Julian takes a look at the menu, then looks away. \nTWO DINNER PLATES ARE CARRIED THROUGH THE RESTAURANT \nand as the CAMERA WIDENS we realize we are: \nIN A CHIC CAFE IN MANHATTAN - LATER THAT NIGHT \nCamera takes us to Erica, Marin, Dave and DAVE'S FIANCE, KRISTEN, a combo of a hot tie and a young professional. Everyone has menus and drinks. A Waiter delivers two new Martinis for Marin and Erica. They both go right for them. Erica drinks too much too fast.                D \nAVE \n(to Erica) Thirsty? \nERICA \nI've had a big week Dave, forgot how these slip right down. I'm fine. So, Kristen, where'd you go to... (burps) --medical school? Excuse me. \nKRISTEN \nUniversity of Pennsylvania. \nERICA \nI went to school in Philadelphia too. \nDAVE \nBryn Mawr girl. \nKRISTEN \nThat's amazing. My Mom went to Bryn Mawr . . . \nMARIN \nWow. So not only are you marrying my father but our mothers went to the same college. Marin takes out a pack of cigarettes. \nMARIN \nAnyone mind? \nKRISTEN \nActually I do. \nMARIN \nOkay, I'll just..have one. (lights up) So, this isn't going badly so far is it? I mean for a totally surreal situation like this. \nDAVE \nShall we order? \nKRISTEN \nAbsolutely. \nDAVE \n(peruses menu) Erica, do I like duck? \nERICA \nYes. It's rabbit you hate. (to Kristen) I'll give you a list of everything he likes and dislikes. \nDAVE \nLet's let her figure some things out on her own. \nERICA \nI didn't mean those things, Dave. She did go to medical school. \nMARIN \n(pointing to herself and Kristen) Hey, not in front of the kids. \nERICA \n(polishing off her Martini) I will tell you this...Dave has one truly great love in his life. \nKRISTEN \nReally? What's that? \nERICA \nHis balls. \nDAVE \n", "test2_true": "E \nERICA \nWhat? It's not true? The man can not watch TV or read without the hand down the pants-- Here's my advice after 21 years I say who cares, they're his balls,let him enjoy 'em. \nMARIN \n(chokes) I think I swallowed my olive, whole. Erica looks up and sees something that takes her breath away. \nA COUPLE ZIGZAGGING AROUND TABLES \nand headed in her direction. A sexy Young Thing followed by her date -- no other than Harry. Harry stops to shake someone's hand, holds his date around the waist. Suddenly, the SOUND DROPS OUT of the restaurant as Harry and his Date walk right by Erica's table in SLOW MOTION, not noticing her. \nM \nOVING IN ON ERICA \nas the room comes alive again. Her eyes follow Harry as he is seated only one table away, his back to Erica, his Date facing her. Marin hasn't seen him. Erica tries her hardest to act normal but apparently isn't. \nMARIN \nMom, you okay? \nERICA \nYeah, fine. Erica looks at her menu then her eyes go right back to Harry. His Date is laughing at something Harry is saying. Harry leans in to her, whispers something to her. She touches his hand. \nRICA \nYou know what? Maybe I need a little air... Erica rises; grabs her purse, almost bumps into a Waiter as she passes Harry's table, knocks into someone's chair, a glass breaks. Everyone turns to her, including Harry. She now stands right at his table. He smiles up at her. \nHARRY \nHey. \nERICA \nHello... Harry. (to his Date) Hello... \nEXT. RESTAURANT \nErica rushes out. She's a little high and her heart is pounding. She heads down the street. \nERICA \nOh, God, I'm so stupid... She picks up her pace, starts running. Her cell phone RINGS. \nERICA \nHello? Intercut Harry and Erica on their cells, a block apart. \nHARRY \n(walking quickly) Slow down. You want to kill me? She considers it. \nERICA \nHarry, I gotta go... \nHARRY \nErica, she's just a friend. \nERICA \nYeah, she looks like a buddy kind of a girl. Erica reaches a corner, can't get across, turns the corner. Harry ARRIVES NEXT TO HER. \nHARRY \nCome on, it's just a dinner... \nERICA \nLook, Harry, here's the problem. I really like you. \nHARRY \nI really like you. \nERICA \nYeah, but I love you like you. (that stops him) I do. I love you. Harry swoons and not in a good way. \nHARRY \nI think maybe you should consider that you're in love with the idea of being in love. \nERICA \nD \no you? Okay. Oh, God... (stomps her feet) I'm like the dumb girl who doesn't get it. (tries not to cry in front of him) I've never been the dumb girl before. It ain't so great. \nHARRY \nLet's just calm down. This was just a a meal with a friend. \nERICA \n-- Did you know I called you seven hours ago? \nHARRY \nI was gonna call you. I've been jamming all day, it's my first day back. \nERICA \nUh-huh. . . \nHARRY \nI had these plans before I met you. But I do like seeing you. I do. I'm always surprised by it. \nERICA \nWhat was I thinking? \nHARRY \nMaybe you weren't thinking for once and look what a good time we had. Let's not ruin something great. \nERICA \nHarry, I won't be good at this. \nHARRY \nAt what? \nERICA \nActing like I don't care. \nHARRY \n", "test2_id": 1426, "test3_input": "C \nAMERA CONTINUES DOWN to street level. Couples walk by, bundled up against the cold. Harry ENTERS FRAME. \nHe looks different. He has a beard and has lost some weight: And in his eyes, a calm we haven't seen before. He pauses in front of the theater -- loo~s at the PUBLICITY PHOTOS. He SEES Henry in his boxer shorts at the refrigerator meeting \"Emily\" and her Sister. He sees ANOTHER PHOTO of The Dancing Henrys kicking up their legs like Rockettes. Then, finally, A PHOTO of Henry and Emily in bed, both wearing glasses. Harry OPENS THE DOOR TO THE THEATER, steps inside and listens, hearing Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose, then, the audience breaks out in LAUGHTER. Harry smiles to himself. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING \nThe elevator opens. Harry steps out, looks around for an apartment number, finds it, rings the bell and clears his throat. The door quickly OPENS and we see MARIN. She looks relaxed and happy to see him. \nMARIN \nI couldn't believe you were calling from downstairs. (hugs him) So great to see you. \nHARRY \nYou couldn't look better. \nMARIN \nThank you. Come on in. \nHARRY \nNo, no, I just wanted to stop by and say hi and tell you I'm sorry if I ever did anything to you that wasn't on the up and up or... \nMARIN \nWhat do you mean? You were great to me. \nHARRY \nI was? \nMARIN \nAlways. \nHARRY \nThat's refreshing. Good. Well, I don't know what you've done to yourself but you look absolutely radiant. \nMARIN \nI'm three months pregnant, that might have something to do with it. \nHARRY, \nReally? Who's ..the, lucky guy? \nMARIN \nMy husband, hold on, he really wants to meet you. (calls) Danny... A Solid Citizen of a Guy joins Marin, loosened tie, glasses... \nMARIN \nHarry Langer, my husband, Danny Yellin. \nDANNY \n(shaking Harry's hand) I've heard so much about you... \nHARRY \nI bet.. . \nDANNY \nYeah, with Hthe play and all... \nARRY \nI'm famous,huh? \nMARIN \nJust to us. In every interview my Mom does, she always says she made you up. \nHARRY \nSo the guy in the play, he doesn't make it, does he? \nDANNY \nHe basically dies at the end of the second act, but it's very funny. (as if that's some consolation) \nHARRY \nWas hopin' she'd give me a reprieve, but... \nMARIN \nYeah, well... \nHARRY \nYeah. Okay...Best of luck, kids... Marin is stumped by this little visit. Harry heads toward the elevator, pushes the button, then turns back. \nHARRY \nHow is she? \nMARIN \nShe's. . . (Harry waits) Really good.     Up to her old tricks. Learning Italian, remodeling her apartment in the city. \nHARRY \nNow if I wanted to see her...how would that go over? \nMARIN \n(encouragingly) Only one way to find out, except she's out of town right now. \nHARRY \nOh yeah? Where is she? \nMARIN \nParis. She left two days ago, for her birthday. But she'll be back next week... The Elevator arrives. Harry salutes his goodbye and steps INSIDE THE ELEVATOR. He turns, FACES CAMERA. \nHARRY \nParis... \nANOTHER ELEVATOR.OPENS \nAnd a clean shaven, dapper looking Harry steps off, cashmere coat, gorgeous scarf. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM out of the elevator and through a BEAUTIFUL LOBBY OF A HOTEL then right onto THE STREET. CAMERA does a 360 and we catch glimpses of PARIS AT NIGHT. CAMERA SETTLES ON HARRY just as the LIGHTS OF THE EIFFEL TOWER POP ON, sending a flood of golden lights high into the night sky directly behind him. \nHARRY \nShowtirne. \nINT. LEFT BANK BISTRO - NIGHT \nErica sits alone at a table in the back of the room, drinking a glass of wine. She looks vibrant. She glances up from her drink and sees what looks like Harry making his way around the tables. She leans to the side for a better look, to make sure it's him. It is him and he's corning right toward her. Her stomach sinks, her mind races... and before she can come up with a single thought that makes any sense -- there he is. \n", "test3_true": "(proud of himself) I knew you'd be here. \nERICA \nYou did? \nHARRY \nI've come a long way to see you, Erica. \nERICA \nYou mean we're not bumping into each other..? You came here to see me? \nHARRY \nYes, I did. (she seems to shiver) I'm aware it was a bold move, one of those impulses that grabs you,' but...so far, we're okay; right? \nERICA \nWell, uh, I mean, I'm just... \nHARRY \nI'll take that as a 'Yes'. Harry takes off his coat and scarf, hangs them on a hook. \nERICA \nYou want a glass of wine or something? \nHARRY \nI was just gonna give you a kiss hello. \nERICA \nOh, Okay. Neither is sure where to go. Cheek? Lips? He lands on her chin. .Not what he wanted, but he takes a seat across from her. She looks at him - utterly speechless. \nHARRY \nI remember you said if we still know each other we should go to Paris for our birthdays, well, we still know each other..\". \nERICA \nThat's true, but, Harry, I haven't heard from you in six months. \nHARRY \nI know but I've certainly been thinking about you. There's a lot I have to say. First thing is... I'm not mad at you anymore. \nERICA \nGood, 'cause I'm not mad at you anymore either. \nHARRY \nThat's a relief...since I did come all the way to France and everything. And... Happy Birthday. \nERICA \n(afraid of everything he could possibly say) Thank you. \nHARRY \nAnd congratulations on your amazing success... \nERICA \nIt's been quite a ride. Funny, I thought maybe I'd hear from you when it opened. Where've you been? \nHARRY \nAfter I saw you in the theater that afternoon, I had another \"episode... \nERICA \nOh, I'm sorry. \nHARRY \nI was actually okay, but I was sure I was dying and the doctor in the ER said I needed to decompress. So I did. I walked out of there and changed my life, sold most of my businesses, packed my bags and moved to an island in the Caribbean. \nE \nRICA \nThat's where you've been all this time? In the Caribbean? \nHARRY \nActually...No. \nEXT. CARIBBEAN BEACH - FLASHBACK \nHarry lies on a chaise under a palm tree, drink in hand, Hawaiian shirt, shades. A steel drum plays in the distance. \nHARRY (V.O. \nI was there about ,six hours, when it occurred to me that wasting away on an island in the Caribbean wasn't going to remotely cure what was ailing me. Harry sits straight up into CAMERA. \nBLACK SCREEN \nA LIGHT POPS ON and we realize we are in HARRY'S CLOSET. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nSo I decided to take another kind of pilgrimage...into my past. Harry ENTERS THE CLOSET, reaches onto a top shelf ,and starts pulling down dozens of what used be called, \"Little Black Books\". \nHARRY (V.O.) \nMy thought was -- if I retraced my steps and visited all the women I've dated... He blows dust off of the books. \nBACK IN PARIS \nHARRY \n-- maybe I could figure out how I got so screwed up. \nFLASHBACK - HARRY'S PILGRIMAGE \nHarry STANDS at one FRONT DOOR after the NEXT, EACH ONE \nSLAMMING IN HIS FACE. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nA lot of the women wouldn't see me. Then, we see WOMEN of various ages SLAP HIM ACROSS THE FACE. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nOr speak to me. Harry reels backwards from one Hefty Mama. \nHARRY (V.O.) \nBut I was on a mission to save my soul. \n", "test3_id": 1427}

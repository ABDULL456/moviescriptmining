FANTASOS . Does Kepheus worry about you? No! Only the Princessa... And still, the Kraken comes! Does the King build his defenses at the water's edge? "NO!" cries the crowd. Peshet is shocked to find herself replying with them -- "NO1" Fantasos motions for Agenor to continue the harangue, while Fantasos hurries off the stage. 
AGENOR No! He makes his stand at his daughter's chamber door!... We will show Kepheus we're not sacrificial fodder. We will tremble the walls of his Basilica! RABID SUPPORT from the mob. Peshet stops suddenly, peering ahead.

AGENOR (O.S.) Andromeda is the one Tiamat wants! We die so she may live... As the crowd EXPLODES, Andromeda hurries away in tears. Peshet fights through the crush to follow her. 
EXT. THE ACROPOLIS - ALLEY.- NIGHT 
Peshet rounds a corner, frustrated. Andromeda is gone. A hand grabs Peshet's shoulder, startling her. It is Fantasos. 
FANTASOS Peshet, you've come at the right time. Fantasos engages her with hypnotic power. Peshet nods, trance-like. 
FANTASOS One night soon, a gong will sound three times. When you hear it, unlock the back gate of the Basilica. Then go to Andromeda's chambers... (hands her a dagger) . and bring the Princess out. My men will take her to Leviathan. Peshet just stares at the dagger, hands trembling. 
FANTASOS Do you understand me? (harshly, off her non- 
RESPONSE) Peshet, do you understand how important your part is? She nods, horrified by her predicament.

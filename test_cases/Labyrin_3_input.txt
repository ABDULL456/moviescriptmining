38	EXT: HEDGE MAZE - DAY 
SARAH rushes up to HOGGLE and throws her arms around him. 
SARAH: What happened to you? I was afraid I'd never see you again! 
HOGGLE: Ya know that trick with the wall? Damn, if it don't work with the floor, as well! 
SARAH laughs and hugs him again. 
39	INT : HEDGE MAZE - DAY 
SARAH and HOGGLE have been walking through the maze a long time. They are tired and bedraggled. SARAH pulls the watch out of her pocket and sighs. 
SARAH: An hour's gone by and I don't think we're more than four feet from where we started. 
HOGGLE: That's 'cause ya won't do what I tells ya. It's clear as day we should be goin' this way ... 
He turns a corner and walks smack into a hedge dead end. He howls in pain and SARAH sighs and follows him. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
HOGGLE disentangling himself from the hedge. 
SARAH: Got any more suggestions? 
Before HOGGLE can answer they are interrupted by a terrible gut-wrenching scream. It is positively unearthly. SARAH whirls around. 
SARAH: It sounds like it came from over there! 
HOGGLE points in the opposite direction. 
HOGGLE: Then let's go this way. 
SARAH frowns at him as the scream begins again. 
SARAH: Hoggle! It sounds like someone's being hurt! 
HOGGLE: Exactly why we should be headin' in the othermost direction! 
SARAH shakes her head in disgust and runs off as the screams become more unbearable. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
SARAH, running through the hedge maze. Driven by the sound of the screams, she has an unconscious ability to find her way through. HOGGLE, trying to keep up with her, keeps running into dead ends. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
SARAH emerging from the maze. She is stopped in her tracks by what she sees and quickly covers her mouth to prevent herself from screaming. HOGGLE emerges a moment later, barely pauses before he heads right back into the maze. 
40	EXT: CLEARING - DAY 
SARAH'S POV - FOUR GOBLINS are torturing a huge creature (LUDO) that they have hung by his ankle from a tree limb. They have also taken pains to bind the CREATURE, who it is obvious could take an most of them and win in a fairer fight. He is about nine feet tall, powerfully built, and his screams of frustrated agony are truly unbearable. The GOBLINS have devised a unique method of harassing him. They ALL carry long sticks which have small, fierce, biting CREATURES on the end of them. The GOBLINS bat their sticks at LUDO, who bellows and tries to swat back. Since he is tied, the NIPPERS are free to bite him whenever they get near. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
SARAH, distraught, peeking out from behind a hedge. 
SARAH: The poor thing! 
HOGGLE peeks out from behind SARAH, then quickly ducks back. SARAH looks for a way to stop the torture. She picks up a rock and carefully aims it at the nearest GOBLIN. It hits his head and knocks his helmet visor over his eyes. Blinded, the GOBLIN lurches around, swinging his nipper stick at the OTHER THREE. 
BLINDED GOBLIN: Hey! Who turned out the lights? 
The OTHER GOBLINS see a new target and poke their nipper sticks towards him. He takes off and runs blindly into the hedge maze. The OTHER THREE chase him, carrying the nipper sticks upright no that WE CAN SEE their progress in the BG.

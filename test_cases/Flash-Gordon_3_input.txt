FLASH What are you waiting for? 
BARIN glares at him, takes a breath, jams his hand into the fourth of the six holes. 
BIG CU BARIN 
His eyes widen horribly, he makes a choked sound. PULL BACK FAST as he whips his hand out, unbitten. His face twists into a grin. 
BARIN Fooled you, didn't I? 
AURA laughs, turns her smile on FLASH. 
AURA It's an even chance now, Flash Gordon -- that's better than Daddy would have given you -- 
FLASH Boy. You oughta be handled with a forked stick yourself. 
BARIN If I were you, I'd choose the sword -- 
The point touches FLASH again. Just two holes left. He does a silently mouthed eeny-meeny-miney-mo between them, plunges his hand into one. 
INSIDE THE STUMP 
The snake's head MOVES fast. 
BACK TO SCENE 
QUICK CU - FLASH'S FACE 
Wincing, contorting. 
As FLASH whips his arm out again. Amazingly, he has hold of the terrible serpent, grasping it just below the head. CRIES from the astounded TREE MEN, and then FLASH is leaping INTO ACTION. 
Whirling, FLASH swings the hissing snapping writhing beast at the nearest TREEMEN, scattering them, and thrusts the serpent's head at BARIN. 
BARIN slashes with his sword, misses. The serpent's tail coils around the blade, rips it from BARIN'S hand as the Prince of Arboria dives backwards. 
FLASH whirls again, SLAMS the serpent's head into a post, and SNATCHES the sword from the tail before it hits the floor. 
MOVING WITH FLASH 
He dashes for the ramp to the ground.. The TIGER MAN is right in front of him, struggling in the net. FLASH pauses, SLASHES at the cords. TIGER MAN is freed, bounds to his feet with a ROAR, clobbers a pair of TREE MEN just jumping on him and FLASH. Snatching one's CROSSBOW and QUIVER OF GLASS ARROWS, he races down the ramp behind FLASH. 
BACK TO TOP LEVEL 
FEATURE BARIN 
Picking himself up, wheeling furiously on AURA, who has been watching all this with her lips half parted, her tongue flicking teeth in supersensuous excitement. 
BARIN (CONT'D) A mere toy of yours, eh? 
AURA (TAUNTING) Maybe I was wrong -- surely the Prince of Arboria wouldn't be beaten by a toy. 
BARIN snatches a horn from his belt, blows a BLAST. 
BARIN The hunt's on, my Tree Men! 
TREE MEN To the hunt with Barin! 
EXT. FOREST - FLASH AND TIGER MAN (FLASH, TIGER MAN) 
They run through the green tangle. FLASH trips over a vine. TIGER MAN picks him up. 
TIGER MAN Thank you for freeing me. 
FLASH You can speak?

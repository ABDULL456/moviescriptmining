TREVOR Rita, would you please read Young's rule for me? 
RITA (hesitates and...) ... 'Young's rule formulates proper dosage levels for children and adolescents.' 
TREVOR Thank you. 
Resume the lesson now.     Trevor indicates the amber bottle... 
TREVOR ... In the brown bottle I have a prescription for liquid Demeral. 
STEVIE Where'd that come from, sir? 
TREVOR A doctor. 
Cesar grudgingly watches as Trevor places a measured drop of the liquid demeral into the petri dish and stirs the solution. 
TREVOR Demeral is a morphine sulphate... and is soluble in water. 
Using the pipette, Trevor administers two drops of the demeral and water solution to the sugar cube, which he has placed inside Snowball's cage. As Snowball eats the sugar cube... 
TREVOR Young's rule says, divide the age of the patient by the patient's age plus twelve, giving us the fraction of the adult dosage suitable for the patient. (MORE)

53   CONTINUED:                                                     53 
TREVOR (CONT'D) In Snowball's case, I've calculated the dosage necessary to tranquilize a one-year-old child... then further divided that fraction by 30, based on his weight, to arrive at .002 milligrams. 
Having eaten most of the sugar cube, Snowball is rendered unconscious. 
TREVOR ... Don't worry, he'll be back to normal in exactly 10 minutes. 
Trevor peers at his pocket watch. 
54   INSERT - FULL SCREEN - TREVOR'S POCKET WATCH                   54 
The hour and minute hands read 2:40.    HOLD as we... 
TIME DISSOLVE TO: 
55   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - TEN MINUTES LATER                          55 
Trevor's pocket watch now reads 2:50... 
RITA ... He shoulda woke up by now? 
Snowball isn't moving. HOLD for an uncomfortably long moment ON the class, clustered around Trevor's desk. 
The class, for once, is completely silent. Beads of perspiration form on Trevor's upper lip as he resolutely watches the sleeping rat. 
CESAR (accusatory) You just caught a murder case, homes. 
Now Snowball begins to stir and the class reacts with scattered applause. A thin smile flickers across Trevor's face. As the BELL RINGS.... 
TREVOR Okay, anyone who didn't finish answering the questions on 246, finish them for homework. 
(CONTINUED) 
55   CONTINUED:                                                     55 
As students head for the doors, he pulls off his latex gloves and looks for his pocket watch... but it's gone. 
TREVOR Hold it, Cesar. 
Cesar and Stevie are almost out the door. 
TREVOR Where's my watch? 
CESAR (urgently) Hey, I gotta go. I ain't got no watch. 
TREVOR Empty your pockets, both of you. 
CESAR Want me to break it down to you? I gotta catch a bus. 
Cesar heads out the door. 
56   EXT. BUNGALOW #86 - MOMENTS LATER                              56 
Trevor locks bungalow #86, picks up his briefcase, and along with the rest of the foot traffic, heads in the direction of the "A" building. 
57   EXT. JQA - ON EDGE OF BUNGALOWS                                57 
As Trevor rounds a corner and runs smack into Ellen on the opposite side of a chain link fence. 
TREVOR (making excuses) Sorry. I'm trying to catch Hyland before he leaves. 
Trevor keeps moving. 
TREVOR I've been meaning to come by your room. 
ELLEN (keeping it light) ... It's almost been a week.   My guess is you're avoiding me. 
(CONTINUED) 
57   CONTINUED:                                                      57 
Trevor's tongue-tied. Now he removes the Proventil inhaler from his pocket, take an innocuous hit. 
ELLEN You okay?

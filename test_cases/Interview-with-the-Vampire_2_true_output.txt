DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 
The camera drifts through the graveyard where Louis' wife is buring. Everything is lit with an eerie glow, as if seen through some unearthly eye. 
LESTAT Vampires, that's what we are. Creatures of darkness, only we see it that darkness more clearly than any mortal has ever seen... 
Louis and Lestat drifting, dreamlike, through the overhanging vines, comes to the grave of his wife and child. Above the crypt, the statue of angel, mother and child. 
LESTAT Wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain goodbye? To wave away anguish and grief? To embrace the peace of the unending night? 
The marble fingers of the child on the statue move. The angel raises her head and has the face of Louis wife, Diane. she raises her hand and touches Louis tear- streamed face. The child speaks. 
MARBLE CHILD Papa... 
Louis reaches out to embrace them and finds himself touching cold marble. He cries out in anguish- 
LOUIS Diane!!!! 
LESTAT They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy... 
LOUIS NO!!!!! 
INT. LOUIS BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Louis, thrashing on the bed in a delirium. Lestat places a hand on his forehead and soothes him. 
LESTAT You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me? 
LOUIS Give it to me!!! 
LESTAT Vampires. We thrive on blood. 
LOUIS I want it! 
Lestat bends close as if to drink Louis' blood. Louis does not shrink back, but stares into his eyes. Lestat draws back, then stands up and goes to the French doors. 
LESTAT Tomorrow night. You must prove yourself. I will give you the choice I never had. 
He looks outside. 
LESTAT The sun's coming up. Watch it carefully. If you come with me tomorrow, you'll never see it again. 
He leaves. Louis sits dazed, staring at the empty French window. The sun rises with unnatural beauty, over the swamplands and the plantation, filling the room, striking water-pitcher, glass, mirror, and the picture of his dead wife. 
LOUIS (V.O.) My last sunrise. That morning I was not yet a vampire, and I saw my last sunrise. I remember it completely, yet I don't remember any sunrise before it. I watched the whole magnificence of the dawn for the last time, as if it were the first. And the I said goodbye to sunlight and went out to become what I became. 
EXT. PLANTATION - NIGHT 
Lestat and Louis walk through the slave quarters, huddles groups around fires, music, singing. The sound of whipping is heard. 
LESTAT Your grief has unhinged you. You've let your estate rot. 
In the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is whipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery. 
LESTAT You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him. 
LOUIS How do you mean, start? 
LESTAT Call him. 
Louis calls. 
LOUIS Carlos!!! 
The overseer turns and comes towards them, with the bloodied whip. 
LESTAT Why the bloody whip, Carlos? 
The overseer looks into his eyes, shivers with terror, drops the whip and runs for the trees. Lestat is on him in an instant. He sinks is teeth in his neck. Louis runs to him, tries to pull him off. But Lestat turns to Louis and smiles, with his bloodied mouth. 
LESTAT Let's call that a start. 
LOUIS I can't do it. 
LESTAT You've just done it - 
LOUIS Kill me if you will, but I can't do this... 
He flees, as Lestat ends to finish off the overseer. 
EXT. POINTE DU LAC - NIGHT

RITA (shaking her head) Oh, no. I can't believe I fell for it. This whole day was just one long set-up. And I ate fudge. Yucchh! I hate fudge. 
PHIL No, it was real. I love you. 
RITA Stop saying that! Do you really expect me to trust you? The whole secretarial pool is a Phil Connors recovery group. 
PHIL But I can change! I really can-- Rita slaps him hard on the cheek. 
RITA That's for making me care about you. She turns and stomps off, leaving Phil standing there hurting. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MAIN STREET - ANOTHER NIGHT 
The snowball fight with the kids is going on as before. Phil falls into the snowbank with Rita and they almost kiss. 
CUT TO: 
INT. QUALITY INN MOTEL - LATER 
Phil is trying (MOS) to talk his way into Rita's room. She ^pushes him away and slams the door in his face. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT 
The streets are deserted except for Phil, staring up at Rita's window in the Quality Inn. Rita comes to her window and looks out. She sees Phil looking up at her and draws the curtains. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWN 
"I Got You, Babe" is playing. Phil hits the clock radio to turn it off. He lies there for a moment, then hefts himself heavily out of bed, not eager to repeat the day yet another time. With the radio off, Phil does the deejays' morning routine himself, seemingly for the millionth time. 
PHIL 
(DULLY) Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's cooooold out there today. Phil continues the radio report at his own pace, obviously fatigued. 
PHIL It's cold out there everyday. What is this -- Miami Beach? Haw. Not hardly. And you can expect hazardous travel later today with that, you know, blizzard thing. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - DAWN 
Phil is walking through the crowd. He spots Nancy, walks up to her and greets her half-heartedly . 
PHIL Hi, Nancy. 
NANCY 
(PLEASANTLY) Hi. Do I know you? Phil can't manage enough enthusiasm to pursue her yet again. 
PHIL No, I guess not. I thought you were someone else. Phil wanders over to where Rita and Larry are setting up the camera. Rita comes over to him. 
RITA Are you all right, Phil? You look terrible. Phil looks at her sadly, then turns away. 
PHIL 
(VACANTLY) I ' m fine. 
CUT TO: 
INT . BIKER BAR - NIGHT The balls CRACK as the cue ball breaks the rack. Phil is walking around the table, cue in hand, sinking ball after ball, while several admiring HUSTLERS look on. 
FIRST HUSTLER Who is this guy? 
SECOND HUSTLER I don't know. Hey, mister-- (Phil doesn't stop 
SHOOTING) Who are you, anyway? Phil shoots, sinks a tough one. 
PHIL You don't know me? I've been playing here every day for two months. 
FIRST HUSTLER Oh, yeah? So how come I ain't seen you? 
PHIL I don't know. I seen you.

INT. FLATBED                                                            188 
Inside the machine, Coffey is fighting for control. 
He has no buoyancy or motors and the craft continues its mad plunge.  As the pressure intensifies the hull begins to groan, and steel fitting scream with the enormous load. 
A tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble.  Grows. Coffey gives up fighting.  Just stares, wide eyed, at his death.  A damned soul dropping into the bottomless pit. 
The fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port. 
Suddenly, a scythe-like curtain of seawater, under tons of pressure, slashes into him.  A moment later the bubble implodes, and Coffey disappears in a bloody froth of churning water, air and glass shards. 
EXT. CANYON WALL                                                        189 
Flatbed looks like a toy, tumbling away down the wall. 
Soon its lights vanish. 
INT. CAB ONE                                                            190 
They're both going to have a lot of bruises... 
Lindsey is surveying the damage.  Water is spraying down on them like a shower, and lights are flickering. 
LINDSEY You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed. 
BUD Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek. 
LINDSEY Not in this thing. 
Lindsey is flipping switches.  Nothing works. 
BUD You totaled it, huh? 
LINDSEY Yeah.  So sue me. 
Bud looks down.  There's already about a foot of water sloshing around the floor at their feet. 
BUD It's flooding like a son of the bitch. 
LINDSEY You noticed. 
She picks up and hand-mike of the underwater telephone. 
LINDSEY Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab One, over. 
She waits.  No response. 
BUD Try again. 
LINDSEY Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this-- 
With a SEARING CRACKLE or arc-light, a power panel shorts out and everything goes black. 
LINDSEY Well, that's that. 
BUD Wonderful. (looking around) There's some light from somewhere... 
A faint illumination, dimmer than moonlight, washes in through the front port. Lindsey scrunches up against the acrylic and scans the darkness. 
LINDSEY Over there.  It's the rig. 
A glow, beyond a rock promontory... like the lights of a town just over the hill in the desert. 
BUD Good hundred yards, I'd say. 
LINDSEY They'll come out after us. 
BUD Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped. 
He picks up his helmet and clicks on the light.  Using the thing like a bulky flashlight.  The water is really pouring in, spraying them like a shower... almost two feet deep already. 
LINDSEY You see where it's coming in? 
BUD Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this. 
She takes the light and he tries to reach the burst weld, which is blocked by a steel switch panel and a bunch of conduit. 
BUD Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools? 
LINDSEY I don't know, look around. 
Bud scans the cramped interior, feels around under the water.  It's past his knees. 
BUD Nothing.  Son of a bitch.  All I need's a goddamn crescent wrench. 
He grabs the panel in both hands and starts torquing on it, trying to wrench it off the wall.  Heaves on it repeatedly.  Finally stops, panting.  He's breathing hard now, and it's not just effort.

ARTHUR Elliot Goff? 
Elliot looks up and suddenly recognizes -- 
ELLIOT Arthur Baylor? 
ARTHUR Yes. 
Elliot is stunned and flattered. He stands quickly. 
ELLIOT Arthur Baylor, oh my God. I ahh, would you ahh... are you here to see me? 
ARTHUR Yes. 
Arthur shuts the door. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 
Door opens. Joe is lead into the room by the JAIL GUARD. Joe looks even better now. His stay in jail has broken his dependency on alcohol. His hair is clean and combed. And he's not as depressed. He stops upon seeing Elliot and Arthur at the table. Both men stand. The guard shuts the door. Arthur looks at Joe for a moment, then says -- 
ARTHUR William. 
Joe stares at Arthur as if fighting a lost memory, then -- 
WILLIAM ...yes. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY - HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY 
HELEN What are you telling me?! 
Richard Stein is facing a not very happy Helen. She is seated behind her desk stacked high with case files. 
HELEN She missed the appointment? She forget you were coming? What?! 
RICHARD STEIN If you want my best guess, I'd say she split. 
HELEN She split, our witness split... Can't we keep our evidence and witnesses from disappearing around here? I mean what do I have to do, lock them in the trunk of my car? What the fuck is going on?! I want that bitch back here and on the stand or in jail! 
Richard Stein nods quickly. 
RICHARD STEIN I'll get her. 
And he exits fast. He doesn't like it when his boss is pissed. And right now his boss is really pissed. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - DAY 
A seedy side street near the courthouse and jail. The unmarked car pulls up and Divinci gets out. 
INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - DAY 
The interior is sparse. Several FRAMED FIGHT POSTERS on the walls. All with MANNY LADREW, a young tough fighter in the featherweight division, in his best pose, explaining where and when the next bout will be -- but all these posters are at least fifteen years old. 
Two desks. One for the secretary, who is on vacation, and the other for MANNY LADREW, the ex-pugilist. He's put on some pounds in the intervening years, plus an added thin mustache. Manny is on the phone -- 
MANNY -- yeah, uh-huh. (takes notes) Why you think he'd go there? 
Divinci enters. 
DIVINCI We need to talk. 
MANNY (covers phone) Just a second. 
DIVINCI Not just a second, now! 
Manny glares at Divinci. He doesn't like Divinci, never has, never will. But he's a cop. Cop's you have to make room for. 
MANNY (into phone) I'll call you back. (hangs up) What d'you want, Divinci? 
Divinci pulls some papers out of his pocket, hands them to Manny. 
DIVINCI I got a witness who took off. I gotta get her back. I don't got a lotta time. 
MANNY You're the fuckin' police. What're you comin' to me for?! 
DIVINCI Don't ask fuckin' questions, you just find her! 
Manny, annoyed, looks at the papers -- photo of Cynthia included. 
MANNY Where've I seen her before? 
DIVINCI She dances. 
MANNY Yeah, right, okay. So what'd she take off for? 
DIVINCI I said -- 
MANNY -- I know what you fuckin' said, but you want me to find her I gotta know why the fuck she took off! So I know where not to look! Okay?! 
DIVINCI ...she's supposed to testify. She got scared, thinks somebody might kill her, so she's hidin'. That's why I want you to find her. If somebody is tryin' to pop her, I don't want anyone knowin' where she is. Manny eyes Divinci. He doesn't believe anything anybody tells him. Especially in his business.

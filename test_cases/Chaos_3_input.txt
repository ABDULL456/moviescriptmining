Dekker scans the line up of people.      Nothing. 
BY THE MEN'S ROOM-- 
A MAN, 40's, in DISGUISE (Brown Wig), SPIES Dekker.          He picks up a CELLPHONE, DIALS... DEKKER'S CELLPHONE RINGS.           He quickly picks it up. 
CONNERS (VO) There's a passage in the Surangama Sutra which, roughly translated means: "Things are not what they appear to be: nor are they otherwise."

DEKKER Conners? 
Dekker again scans the line -- he's not there.         He scans all the faces AGAIN, but still nothing. 
CONNERS (VO) Think about that a minute... Doesn't that blow your mind? (beat) What gave me away? 
DEKKER Ten bucks. 
CONNERS (VO) At the diner. That's right...       Well, to err is human. 
Dekker SPOTS A MAN ON A CELLPHONE, he runs up to him, SPINS HIM AROUND, BUT... It's not Conners. 
CONNERS (VO) Was it Harry that gave him up? 
DEKKER Harry and the phone call. He called me, said Callo was insignificant. Threw up a red flag. 
CONNERS (VO) That wasn't him. That was my mistake. I called you.

Dekker at his car... On the phone, listens.       But on this ends it sounds like...

CONNERS (VO) York always thought "the plan" was flawless. He was cocky. I told him you have to leave room for error. You can't always predict how it's all going to play out. A random camera catches an image of Richards, the scent on the money... you. You were the biggest wrench of the day. The Chaos Theory... When you got that... I was impressed. 
DEKKER All day long, we were trying to find out who the inside source was... it was you. 
CONNERS The more information you gather, from as many sources as possible, no matter how unpleasant the methods are, the better. And while I'd like to take sole credit it was a team effort. 
DEKKER (beat) Teddy's pretty devastated about your death. 
CONNERS (VO) She'll get over it.

Conners PUSHES DEKKER OUT OF THE WAY, just in the nick of time! 
DEKKER TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS!      Vincent breaks his fall. 
Conners FIRES TOWARDS THE DOOR!      After... 
Conners takes out a small remote detonator.     Pushes the FIRST BUTTON! 
A VENT...   A FLASH GOES BY!

ON THE FLOOR... next to the base of the door is a FUSE. It runs from the wall into the vent. Teddy follows it into THE KITCHEN. 
TEDDY Gas.   Get out of here!    Get out of here NOW! 
The fuse comes out of the vent... IT'S LIT! THE OVEN... HEAR the gas emission... The spark. The Gas.

{"test1_input": "\"JAWS 2\" \nFinal Draft Screenplay \nby \nCarl Gottlieb \nBased on a Story \nby \nHoward Sackler \nFADE IN: \nUNDERWATER - DAY \nDramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface. \nA dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the distance. Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming side by side. They are wearing minimal rubber, considering the cool New England waters: \"Farmer John\" wetsuits with cut- off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including an expensive camera with a flash attachment. \nOne motions \"Down there,\" the other signals \"OK, I see it,\" and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and floating vegetation into cathedral-like columns of illumination. \nSEA BOTTOM - DAY \nThe wreck of the working fisherman's boat \"ORCA,\" formerly under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these four years. \nBuried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting strands of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage, glimmering with stainless steel highlights. A fitful flash of yellow from under a mossy beard -- a battered barrel, similarly tangled. \nThe divers, Bert and Ernie, appear. They're fascinated by the find, and Bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash shots. The rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor drive camera. \nANOTHER POINT OF VIEW \nDistant flashes, obscured by vegetation in the foreground. \nSEA BOTTOM, THE ORCA \nErnie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut, moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage. \nAn occasional \"Flash!\" lights up the bottom as Bert continues snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark. \nBERT'S POINT OF VIEW - CAMERA VIEWFINDER (PROCESS) \nErnie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit. A big hand, f.g., motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait. \nHe obliges. Now he floats in front of us, gently paddling his flippers to maintain vertical stability. One flash. \nAnother. Then a large, dim movement in the b.g. \nSomething's out there, moving towards us. \nFlash. It's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel. \nFlash! It's on us. Flash! Teeth? Blood? Flash! Blackness, Death. \nOCEAN BOTTOM, INSERT \nThe camera floats gently down and settles in the sand. A dark red mist eddies by. A last weak flash. \nMATCH DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. OCEAN - SUNDOWN \nFlash! An expensive cabin cruiser, the \"Diver Working\" flag fluttering limply in the breeze, is riding alone at anchor. \nFlash! A distant lighthouse beacon winks at us. The boat rocks in the ceaseless swell. \nOn the stern, \"Elizabeth T. - Newport, R.I.\" A long way from home... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY \nA blue-and-white police jeep is bouncing over the sand. A figure in civilian clothes driving alone on some urgent mission. It's Martin Brody, Chief of Police on Amity. \nThe jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs leading to a concrete patio two at a time. A classical trumpet solo is playing in the background. Brody charges through a door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a hotel interior: The Holidome, a three-story extravaganza of a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony is already in progress. A banner announces: \"Grand Opening Ball -- Amity Scholarship Fund Benefit.\" Brody crosses under a High School band, arranged dance-band style on a balcony; the trumpet player, Polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled crowd applauds politely. Brody is taking his place with some dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority, Amity Mayor Larry Vaughn, begins speaking. \nVAUGHN Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that eloquent solo. Now, for that point in the ceremonies where we formally dedicate this magnificent resort- hotel complex, a worthwhile addition to the recreational paradise we call Amity. \nANGLE ON THE DAIS \nSeated on folding chairs, wearing their good suits, several of Amity's Selectmen, Real Estate Developer Len Peterson, and Ellen Brody, very chic. Brody slips into the vacant chair next to her. The following is conducted in urgent whispers, sotto voce, while Vaughn drones on. \nELLEN Where the hell were you? \nBRODY Late. \nELLEN I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal? \nBRODY Couldn't help it. Hendricks over there... (he indicates his deputy) ...still has the keys to the jeep in his pocket, and I couldn't find the spares. \nELLEN Terrific. Act as if you've been here all along. \nBRODY How'm I supposed to do that? \nELLEN Look bored. \nVAUGHN (droning along) Holiday Inn joins the Amity Shores development condominium complex in a welcome expression renewed interest in Amity Island as the hub of the Northeast Recreational Vacation Wonderland. We're happy once again to be in the center of things, where the action is... We've had our share of hard times and long winters and the past few years have not been easy. But today, the sun is rising on a new Amity, a new island filled with promise. (applause) Len Peterson's Amity Shores Development is an exciting addition to our island. The Holiday Inn we stand in is likewise a new friend who we welcome as family. Amity means 'friendship' and our community extends its friendship to all who seek her shores in peace and harmony. (applause) \nBrody settles into polite attentiveness, acknowledging a wave from Hendricks, a politely bland young town cop in his idea of civilian finery. Hendricks is fussing with the banner on an attractive young lady in a bathing suit... \nANGLE ON VAUGHN \nVAUGHN ...And now, Tina Wilcox, this year's Miss Amity, will cut the ribbon that officially opens this luxurious new hotel... \nTina (the girl in the bathing suit) escapes Hendricks' attentions, and teeters on high heels towards the ribbon, while Phil Fogarty, the local photographer, snaps away. \nVAUGHN Tina was selected from more than 20 of this island's lovely young ladies in the Miss Amity competition held every spring, and she'll represent Amity Island in the Miss Massachusetts Competition in Worcester next month. When she cuts this ribbon, she will be opening our island to growth, to development, to planned expansion with full employment for our thriving community. \n", "test1_true": "Paul Lohman (\"Polo\" to his friends) is exchanging whispers with Lucy, a flute player nearby. \nLUCY I don't think she's such hot stuff. \nPOLO When are we going out? You and me? \nLUCY Not tonight. \nPOLO You going with Patrick? \nLucy nods, Polo shrugs, and turns to Jane, a girl nearby. \nPOLO Listen, Jane -- you want to dance as soon as we get out of these monkey suits? \nShe nods happily, they whisper together, while we: \nCUT TO: \nANGLE ON DAIS \nMartin and Ellen have been joined by their youngest son, Sean. \nSEAN Mom, Michael won't talk to me. \nBRODY (to Ellen) Shouldn't he be at home? \nELLEN Mrs. Silvera couldn't come. \nVAUGHN This money tree, you may have noticed, is made entirely of twenty-dollar bills, donated by Len Peterson, the builder of Amity Shores Condominiums, as a gesture of goodwill towards the community. $500 as a special gift to the Amity township scholarship fund... \nApplause from the crowd, Len takes a bow. \nVAUGHN (prompting) Go ahead, Tina. \nANGLE ON TINA \nas she reaches out with the scissors. Something catches her eye, and she winks at her boyfriend, Ed Marchand, smirking in the crowd. He winks back, and makes \"Cut it\" motions with his fingers. \nANGLE ON THE CEREMONY \nTina cuts the ribbon, and Tom Andrews, a local diver, pushes a decorated float out into the pool; sparklers sputter, balloons drop from the ceiling. \nVAUGHN Thanks to Tom Andrews, of Amity Aqua- Sports, for contributing the special decorations. And now, the Amity High School band. Refreshments on the patio, everyone... \nThe band swings into \"Downtown,\" and the crowd gets up to dance, to eat, and to break into small groups to talk. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOLIDOME - LATER \nEllen is dragging Brody over to where Len Peterson and Larry Vaughn, the mayor, are in conversation. They pass vignettes: \nTina and Ed, Tom Andrews and Jane, Marge, other interesting Amity townspeople. \nBRODY (seeing Peterson and Vaughn) Do I have to talk to those two? \nELLEN My boss and your boss. Sure. \nVAUGHN Hello, hello. It went well, I thought. \nBRODY Very impressive ceremony. Good speech. \nVAUGHN Thank you, thank you. You know my son, don't you? \nHe beckons over their heads to Larry Vaughn, Jr., a young man uncomfortable in his correct tie and blazer. They exchange perfunctory greetings. \nPETERSON The speech was right on the money. (to Ellen) Be a love and make sure the bar's open, will you? \nHe puts his arm around her, a little too familiarly for Brody's liking. \nPETERSON (to Brody) Fantastic lady. Don't know what I'd do without her. \nBRODY Me neither. \nPETERSON (looking around) Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town. \nBRODY All of us thank you, okay? \nELLEN Watch Sean for a minute? \nAnd she hands Sean off to Brody, leaving him with an over- active 10 year old, while she's gone. \nSEAN Can I go swimming? \nBRODY No. Find your brother, okay? \nSean nods and runs off, happy to have a mission. \nCUT TO: \nANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY - NEAR THE BAND \nHe is talking to Brooke Peters, a mop-maned teen-ager with a pleasant face. \nTimmy Weldon, a grade behind, lurks nearby. A plumpish, curly- haired buddy, Andy Nicholas, is enjoying a cup of punch. \nMIKE How old is your cousin? \nBROOKE Seventeen. She's a senior. \nMIKE I'm not crazy about blind dates. \nANDY They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups. \nBROOKE That's awful. \nANDY What the hell.

OCEAN - DAY \nSitting snug and ship-shape on Mike's Green Machine are Mike, Andy, Brooke, and Jackie. They are heeled over in a brisk wind, making good headway; sailing nearby in the b.g. are Patrick and Lucy and Donny and Denise, in their boats. \nLUCY (from her boat) Where're we going? \nANDY Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse. \nBROOKE The lighthouse? \nANDY No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic. \nMIKE We got some stuff at the store. Ed and Tina are going to be there. \nBROOKE Oh, sure, they would be. \nJACKIE What's the lighthouse? \nMIKE It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse. We sometimes hang out there, you know... \nJACKIE Great. I got some wine. \nShe opens her big floppy bag, revealing the top half of a jug of Mountain Red. Brooke slides over to her. \nANGLE ON BROOKE AND JACKIE \nBROOKE (aside) The lighthouse is a make-out spot. \nJACKIE Now I really want to see it. \nBROOKE You going to fool around with Mike? (Jackie shrugs) Well, I'm not doing anything with him. \nShe indicates Andy, who pretends great indifference. \nJACKIE Well, maybe I will, then. \nAndy does about a triple take before he regains his cool. \nMike concentrates on his sailing, Jackie grins an impish, vixen grin, Brooke shrugs. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAY \nspectacular view from the top of the old lighthouse, showing ocean, sandy beach, some of the Kids' catamarans pulled up on the sand, other pleasure boats cruising in the b.g. \nEd and Tina are running down the stairs, laughing. \nED Come on back up here! \nTINA Nope. \nED Give me back my hat! \nTINA Double nope! \nANGLE ON THE SAND \nwhere Andy, Mike, Jackie, and Brooke are camped around a blanket listening to a portable radio. Ed and Tina run by. \nANDY Why'd they decide to move? \nBROOKE Too hot in the lighthouse? \nMIKE Too hot for those two? I can't believe it. \nJACKIE Is there something I don't know about? \nBROOKE I told you, remember? \nJACKIE Oh, yeah. So why aren't they doing it now? \nThere's a little round of giggling. \nANDY Maybe by now they are. \nMIKE They're moving pretty fast. \nJACKIE He's cute... \nANGLE ON ED & TINA \nrunning towards a dune and over it. \nANGLE ON MASSIVE SHAPE \nin f.g., covered with birds. Ed and Tina appear over the crest of a dune, and the frame explodes in a flurry of seagulls, suddenly disturbed. The whir and drumbeat of wings, and the shrieking of the gulls is a jarring shock. \nCLOSEUP - TINA \nreacting. \nTINA Yech! \nHER POINT OF VIEW \nThe huge hulk of a beached, decomposing dead whale, a few birds still pecking at scraps of blubber and entrails. Big festering red holes mark its sides. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLONG SHOT -  SAND AND WHALE \nFrom the top of the lighthouse, we can see a group of interested spectators, clustered around the whale like ants at a picnic. A few more boats are beached and riding at anchor just off the shore, including the Amity police boat. \nThree Ants are walking towards the crowd, one of them gesturing. \nCUT TO: \nANGLE ON BRODY, HENDRICKS AND A WOMAN \n", "test2_true": "BRODY As soon as I heard about it, I called you. This thing is big! \nHis arms indicate big. \nELKINS After we've looked, we'll talk. \nHENDRICKS This is it. \nHe moves forward to clear the crowd. Some kids are poking the massive hulk with sticks. A tourist couple is snapping away with a Polaroid SX-70. The whole mess stinks, too. \nHENDRICKS Move back, please... back off... open it up a little... \nThe crowd edges back, giving way to Brody and Elkins. \nBRODY See? What'd I tell you? \nANGLE ON THE WHALE \nBrody is holding a handkerchief to his nose as he approaches the dead thing, indicating a huge open wound on the side. \nBRODY Look at that! \nELKINS First things first. \nShe produces a tape measure and gives one end to Brody. \nELKINS From the tip of the snout, please. \nElkins is measuring the length of the creature. She calls off numbers to Hendricks, who is officiously writing it all down, repeating numbers as he hears them. \nELKINS Length, 22 feet, 8 inches. \nBRODY Come on, let's check the bite radius. \nELKINS (cold) The what? \nBRODY Bite radius. You know, the size of the mouth? \nELKINS The whale's mouth? \nBRODY The Shark's mouth. \nELKINS What shark? \nBrody pitches his voice low, so that the crowd won't listen. \nBRODY The shark that did this. It was a shark, wasn't it? \nELKINS We don't know that, do we? \nBRODY But that's what we're here to find out, right? \nELKINS You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay? \nHENDRICKS I can't hear you if you're going to whisper. \nMIKE Can we go now? \nHe turns to join the kids as they slip through the crowd to return to their blanket, ad-libbing good-byes. \nBRODY (to Mike) You stay here a minute. \nMIKE Oh, c'mon. \nBRODY You heard me. \nJACKIE We'll be over by the lighthouse. \nMIKE I'll be right there. Wait up. \nThey hang around, waiting for him. Elkins has reclaimed Brody's attention. \nELKINS Could be a shark. But maybe not. \nBRODY Look, I know a little bit about sharks. \nELKINS Do you? \nBRODY I know that this was probably a Great White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan... \nHe fumbles for the correct Latin. \nELKINS (helping out) Carcharadon Carcharias. \nBRODY That's it. \nELKINS Okay, so that's it. \nBRODY Is there one in these waters? \nELKINS What makes you think there might be? \nBRODY Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish... \nELKINS This is a mammal, not a fish. \nBRODY Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want to know if a Great White Shark did this. \nELKINS Probably. \nBRODY That's it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around... \nELKINS And sound. \nBRODY (this is a new one) Sound? \nELKINS Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency vibration. \nBRODY So there's one around here. \n", "test2_id": 598, "test3_input": "ON THE WATER \nLarry Vaughn, Jr. comes skimming in close to the surf. Bob is handling the sheets, Larry is giving young Jackie sailing lessons -- at the moment he's showing her how the tiller works.  He's on her like glue. \nJACKIE This is fun! Can we go faster? \nLARRY (to Bob) Trim. \nBob does, Larry trims the main, and the hull lifts. \nJACKIE Yay! \nShe snuggles in Larry's arms. He waves to someone. \nLARRY That's my dad! \nJackie waves without seeing. \nON THE BEACH \nVaughn waves back, preoccupied. Near him, Mike Brody looks up, his face grim, jealous, and now a little nuts. He splashes paint onto the wood with angry abandon. \nVAUGHN (to Peterson) Wave to my son. \nPETERSON (waving) How the hell do we get him down from there? \nVAUGHN Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus. \nMrs. Bryant approaches them, tugging her daughter. \nMRS. BRYANT Renee wants to know what that man is doing way up there? \nPETERSON He's, ah, watching. A lookout. \nMRS. BRYANT For what? \nRENEE (a precocious little girl) It's a shark tower. I saw one in Florida. He's looking for sharks. \nVAUGHN It's an observation platform. That's our Chief of Police. He's just checking it. \nPETERSON Normally, it's used for, ah, bird watching. Nature observation. Weather measurements, that sort of thing. (a little desperate) Ellen, we're running late! \nELLEN Okay. Folks, if we could get back on, we'll show you the country club, and stop for lunch... \nAt the mention of lunch, the prospects, all hungry, begin flocking back into the van.

There's something out there. He mashes his binoculars to his eyes, trying to get a better look. \nHIS POINT OF VIEW (PROCESS) \nThrough the binoculars, something big and black, moving under the buoys and into the swimming area. \nBRODY AGAIN \nHe can't believe it. But looking past him, we can see it with the unaided eye: a seething dark mass, moving through the water towards the unprotected bathers. \nBRODY (screaming) Out of the water! Everyone out of the water! \nNo one can hear him. A few little faces look up, unable to catch what he's saying. He starts climbing down the ladder shouting. \nBRODY Get out of the water! Tell everyone to get out! Now! Out of the water! \nANGLE ON PETERSON, VAUGHN, AND NICHOLS \nreacting. \nVAUGHN (recalling another panic) Oh, my God... \nPETERSON What the hell is he doing? \nNICHOLS Oh, no! \nELLEN, MIKE, AND SEAN \nLooking up, startled at Brody's sudden panic. \nTHE WATER \nThe dark mass almost on top of the swimmers, who are starting to look around. Most of them are oblivious to what's happening on shore. \nFOLLOW BRODY \nas his feet hit the sand and he starts running for the water, fumbling for his gun and the speed-loader with the cyanide bullets. He is bumping into people, knocking little kids over, stepping on blankets and umbrellas, a madman. \nBRODY Out of the water! Now! Everyone! \nVAUGHN \nRunning too, half-stumbling, half-believing, remembering... \nELLEN \nMoving after her husband, while Mike steadies Sean, holding the impulsive kid back. \nELLEN (seeing something) Martin! No! \nANGLE ON BRODY AGAIN \nThe gun is out now, he's trying draw a bead on the shape in the water; chest heaving, he tries to steady his shaky grip. People see the gun and scream, throwing themselves flat on the sand, running, some of them going into the water. \nBRODY No! Don't go in! Stay out! Stay clear! \nHe fires. Again. Bullets ricochet off the water, howling towards the horizon. Real panic now. Four more shots. \n", "test3_true": "ANGLE ON A LIFEGUARD \nstanding on his platform, shocked, watching the Chief of Police fumbling with his gun. \nLIFEGUARD It's bluefish! It's a school of bluefish! Chief! It's bluefish! \nANGLE ON THE WATER \nIt is bluefish -- a tight mass of them, churning up the water in a dark, dense group. The swimmers look around, confused by the shots and excitement. \nA SWIMMER What's going on? \nANOTHER SWIMMER Fish! Anyone got a net? \n3RD SWIMMER Someone get me a rod and reel! \nLaughter defuses the tension in the water; bathers move around, some getting closer to see the fish, others leaving the water to join friends and families on the sand. \nANGLE ON THE BEACH \nwhere Brody is now standing, panting, coming down as a crowd collects at a safe distance around him: Ellen emerges from a group that includes Vaughn, Peterson, and Nichols. \nBRODY Sorry. I'm sorry. False alarm... \nCurious crowd murmurs as they watch this lunacy. Brody realizes he's fired his weapon, that spent shells litter the sand at his feet. \nBRODY Okay, it's all over, go on, it's over. No trouble... \nEllen joins him. \nELLEN It's okay. It's over... \nBrody drops to his knees, fumbling for the cyanide bullets in his gun, trying to put things in order, scrabbling in the sand for the empty shells. \nThe crowd is curious and embarrassed. Some turn away, others \ndrift back to their blankets, talking about what's just happened, others stare rudely. Brody is coming apart. \nBRODY It's all right, everything's all right... \nSean emerges from the crowd, and helps his daddy pick up the bullets, Ellen moves to disperse the rudely curious. \nELLEN (O.S.) Let's go, everyone... Mrs. Bryant, Len, please... \nCLOSE ON BRODY AND SEAN \nHe sees Sean, his eyes fill with tears, and he grabs the kid in a fierce hug. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. TOWN HALL - DAY \nA hurriedly called meeting of the town's Selectmen is in session: Vaughn, Peterson, and three others: Kaiser, an old man still in his grocery clerk's apron; Sansom; and Nichols, the woman on the beach. \nVAUGHN Brody's a good man. \nKAISER Nobody says he isn't. \nPETERSON You should've been out there. You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac. There were shots fired! \nVAUGHN He thought he had a good reason. \nMS. NICHOLS But that's not rational behavior! \nPETERSON That's what I'm saying! \nVAUGHN How many people were there? \nMS. NICHOLS Hundred! Literally hundreds. What are they going to say about us? \nPETERSON (to Vaughn) Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else. \nVAUGHN So? So? \nPETERSON So it can't be done like that. The man's a menace, plain and simple. \nVAUGHN Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over. We have to deal with the consequences. \nSANSOM That's what we're here to do. \nVAUGHN All right.

What's done is done, and Brody is trying to figure out how to live with it. The phone rings, is answered in the other room. The buzzer sounds. Brody picks up his end. \nBRODY Polly, no calls, please... (she insists) Okay, okay. (he punches a button) Hello... Phil? Fogarty? What pictures... I'll be right down... \nHe slams down the phone and gets up to go, suddenly possessed with a purpose. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DARKROOM - DAY \nAmid the equipment, clutter and proofs, some shots of the holidome opening, drying on wires. Phil Fogarty, the indignant fat man and town photographer, is locking the door behind an impatient Brody. \nPHIL I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped. I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days. Believe me, it's a pleasure... \nBRODY You said something about a camera. \nPHIL Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in-law, in Montauk, he works at a hi-fi store, and they sell cameras, so he... \n", "test3_id": 599}

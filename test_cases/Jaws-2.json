{"train": "\"JAWS 2\" \nFinal Draft Screenplay \nby \nCarl Gottlieb \nBased on a Story \nby \nHoward Sackler \nFADE IN: \nUNDERWATER - DAY \nDramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface. \nA dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the distance. Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming side by side. They are wearing minimal rubber, considering the cool New England waters: \"Farmer John\" wetsuits with cut- off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including an expensive camera with a flash attachment. \nOne motions \"Down there,\" the other signals \"OK, I see it,\" and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and floating vegetation into cathedral-like columns of illumination. \nSEA BOTTOM - DAY \nThe wreck of the working fisherman's boat \"ORCA,\" formerly under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these four years. \nBuried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting strands of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage, glimmering with stainless steel highlights. A fitful flash of yellow from under a mossy beard -- a battered barrel, similarly tangled. \nThe divers, Bert and Ernie, appear. They're fascinated by the find, and Bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash shots. The rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor drive camera. \nANOTHER POINT OF VIEW \nDistant flashes, obscured by vegetation in the foreground. \nSEA BOTTOM, THE ORCA \nErnie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut, moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage. \nAn occasional \"Flash!\" lights up the bottom as Bert continues snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark. \nBERT'S POINT OF VIEW - CAMERA VIEWFINDER (PROCESS) \nErnie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit. A big hand, f.g., motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait. \nHe obliges. Now he floats in front of us, gently paddling his flippers to maintain vertical stability. One flash. \nAnother. Then a large, dim movement in the b.g. \nSomething's out there, moving towards us. \nFlash. It's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel. \nFlash! It's on us. Flash! Teeth? Blood? Flash! Blackness, Death. \nOCEAN BOTTOM, INSERT \nThe camera floats gently down and settles in the sand. A dark red mist eddies by. A last weak flash. \nMATCH DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. OCEAN - SUNDOWN \nFlash! An expensive cabin cruiser, the \"Diver Working\" flag fluttering limply in the breeze, is riding alone at anchor. \nFlash! A distant lighthouse beacon winks at us. The boat rocks in the ceaseless swell. \nOn the stern, \"Elizabeth T. - Newport, R.I.\" A long way from home... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY \nA blue-and-white police jeep is bouncing over the sand. A figure in civilian clothes driving alone on some urgent mission. It's Martin Brody, Chief of Police on Amity. \nThe jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs leading to a concrete patio two at a time. A classical trumpet solo is playing in the background. Brody charges through a door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a hotel interior: The Holidome, a three-story extravaganza of a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony is already in progress. A banner announces: \"Grand Opening Ball -- Amity Scholarship Fund Benefit.\" Brody crosses under a High School band, arranged dance-band style on a balcony; the trumpet player, Polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled crowd applauds politely. Brody is taking his place with some dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority, Amity Mayor Larry Vaughn, begins speaking. \nVAUGHN Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that eloquent solo. Now, for that point in the ceremonies where we formally dedicate this magnificent resort- hotel complex, a worthwhile addition to the recreational paradise we call Amity. \nANGLE ON THE DAIS \nSeated on folding chairs, wearing their good suits, several of Amity's Selectmen, Real Estate Developer Len Peterson, and Ellen Brody, very chic. Brody slips into the vacant chair next to her. The following is conducted in urgent whispers, sotto voce, while Vaughn drones on. \nELLEN Where the hell were you? \nBRODY Late. \nELLEN I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal? \nBRODY Couldn't help it. Hendricks over there... (he indicates his deputy) ...still has the keys to the jeep in his pocket, and I couldn't find the spares. \nELLEN Terrific. Act as if you've been here all along. \nBRODY How'm I supposed to do that? \nELLEN Look bored. \nVAUGHN (droning along) Holiday Inn joins the Amity Shores development condominium complex in a welcome expression renewed interest in Amity Island as the hub of the Northeast Recreational Vacation Wonderland. We're happy once again to be in the center of things, where the action is... We've had our share of hard times and long winters and the past few years have not been easy. But today, the sun is rising on a new Amity, a new island filled with promise. (applause) Len Peterson's Amity Shores Development is an exciting addition to our island. The Holiday Inn we stand in is likewise a new friend who we welcome as family. Amity means 'friendship' and our community extends its friendship to all who seek her shores in peace and harmony. (applause) \nBrody settles into polite attentiveness, acknowledging a wave from Hendricks, a politely bland young town cop in his idea of civilian finery. Hendricks is fussing with the banner on an attractive young lady in a bathing suit... \nANGLE ON VAUGHN \nVAUGHN ...And now, Tina Wilcox, this year's Miss Amity, will cut the ribbon that officially opens this luxurious new hotel... \nTina (the girl in the bathing suit) escapes Hendricks' attentions, and teeters on high heels towards the ribbon, while Phil Fogarty, the local photographer, snaps away. \nVAUGHN Tina was selected from more than 20 of this island's lovely young ladies in the Miss Amity competition held every spring, and she'll represent Amity Island in the Miss Massachusetts Competition in Worcester next month. When she cuts this ribbon, she will be opening our island to growth, to development, to planned expansion with full employment for our thriving community. \nANDY Is she responsible for the punch? \nMIKE No. \nANDY Good. It's terrible. \nBROOKE My cousin will be here tomorrow. \nMIKE Great. \nSean finds them, and bursts into their group. \nSEAN Michael, Michael, Dad said to find you. \nANDY Okay, you did that. \nSEAN Come on, Mikey, come on... \nHe tugs at Mike's sleeve; Mike allows himself to be dragged off. \nMIKE Okay, okay. Got to go. \nAndy and Brooke are left standing together, Tim moves in. \nTIM (to Brooke) Want to dance? (she shakes her head \"no\") Okay. Later? \nOn her shrug, as she turns to Andy: \nCUT TO: \nINT./EXT. HOLIDOME PATIO/TERRACE - NIGHT \nIt's later; night has fallen, the band is playing its version of \"When I Fall in Love.\" Many teen-agers are dancing out on the patio, some adults are dancing inside, the buffet is ravaged, Timmy is watching Brooke, who's dancing with Polo. \nDouglas Fetterman (\"Doug\") joins him, after asking Marge for a dance and striking out. \nDOUG Get a dance yet? \nTIMMY Nope. \nDOUG Me neither. \nTIMMY Who'd you ask? \nDOUG Tina Wilcox. \nTIMMY You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend. \nDOUG Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest. \nTIMMY That's a crock of shit. \nDOUG I know. \nBob Burnside, a tall pal of Larry Vaughn Jr.'s, turns up by their side. \nBOB Same tired old faces. You see Vaughn? \nDOUG The mayor? \nBOB Larry Vaughn Junior? (Doug shrugs) If you see him, tell him I got a six- pack, a blanket, and the Brebner twins. \nHe exits, on the prowl. \nTIMMY No class. \nDOUG None at all. (pause) I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night. \nANGLE ON BRODY AND ELLEN \nBRODY Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man? \nELLEN Why? \nBRODY Because they're playing our song. \nAnd sure enough, they are -- the band has turned to a Fifties slow-dance standard: \"I Wish You Love.\" Peterson approaches. \nPETERSON May I have this dance? \nBRODY Sorry, I'm all booked up... (taking Ellen) Come, m'dear. \nThey slowly fox trot out onto the terrace. Both of them nodding greetings to townspeople and kids -- everyone knows the chief. \nBRODY Remember 1959, the Jersey shore? \nELLEN And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me. \nBRODY I did, I did. \nThe music and the summer moon are working their magic. \nBRODY Listen -- what are you doing later? \nELLEN Fooling around? \nBRODY Right. \nHe dips with her; they look up and notice Sean, sound asleep on a bench. \nELLEN Let's get the kid home. \nBRODY Home it is. \nHe crosses to the sleepy Sean and hoists him with a grunt. \nBRODY (to the kid) You're getting a little big for this. \nSean murmurs sleepily and hugs his dad. Mike, dancing with Marge, waves good-bye. The Brodys start to leave, passing a bucket with a bottle of champagne still in it. They exchange a look, nod agreement, and Brody boosts the bottle, sneaking it out of the building while Ellen giggles. \nSKIPPER You got a gold-plater drifting in the main channel. Big cruiser. \nHENDRICKS Whereabouts? \nSKIPPER Off the Point. No running lights, just a diver's flag. \nHENDRICKS (aside to Brody) Want me to run out there? \nBRODY On your own time? \nHENDRICKS Happy to do it. \nBRODY Then check it out. I'll be in the office. \nHendricks nods, and starts the engine importantly. \nHENDRICKS Cast off your bow line. And your stern line. Spring line... \nWhile Red grumbles, Brody and Sean are walking up to the street. \nMichael and some teen-agers are headed down to the dock. \nANGLE ON BRODY AND THE KIDS \nIt's Mike, Polo, Patrick, Lucy, Brooke, Ed and Tina. \nBRODY Where to? \nMIKE No place special. Just hanging out. \nBRODY Sailing? \nMike nods. \nBRODY Watch your kid brother, huh? \nHe gets into his jeep, leaving Sean with the teen-agers. \nBROOKE Bye, Mr. Brody. \nThe others ad lib appropriate greetings/good-byes, as Brody drives off in his jeep. \nEXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY \nThe Kids busy themselves with their boats while Sean hovers around Mike, who's not happy at baby-sitting his kid brother. \nPOLO Anyone want to sail to the lighthouse? \nPATRICK Machs nix to me. \nLUCY Anyone got a spare mooring line? Mine's shot. \nTINA I've got one... \nSEAN Can I go too? \nMIKE No. \nSEAN Please. \nMIKE I said, 'No.' \nTina's in her boat, \"Tina's Joy,\" a neat sloop. Mike is going over his \"Green Machine,\" a sleek catamaran. \nBROOKE You're not going out right away, are you? \nMIKE Waiting for Andy. \nBROOKE I want you to meet my cousin. \nMIKE I will, I will. \nSEAN I want to go out with you. You need a crew, don't you? \nBefore Sean can protest further, Mike spots his crew: Andy Nicholas, a round-faced, frizzy-haired pal, wearing a bathing suit, and carrying some scuba gear from an early-morning diving class. Marge and Denise, two other divers, are with him, with their gear. They ad-lib \"good-byes.\" \nMIKE I don't need you. Andy's here. \nSEAN You always go with Andy. \nMIKE (to Andy) How was dive class? \nANDY Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble- bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean. \nBROOKE Shells and lobsters and stuff? \nANDY Mostly old garbage. Today we found a '48 Hudson. \nSEAN Do I have to play with the little kids? \nMIKE Yeah. Go on, beat it. \nSean mopes away while Andy and Mike get their boat ready for sea. \nFOLLOW SEAN OFF THE DOCK \nUp on the street, where a pretty girl with a sexy face and a provocative post-pubescent walk is asking him directions. \nHe points down at the dock. The Girl, Jackie Peters, waves at her cousin, Brooke. \nJACKIE Brooke! Hey! \nOne of the boats has a portable radio going. It's playing some medium-hot salsa. Jackie does a couple of dance steps on her way down the dock. \nCLOSE ON ANDY AND MIKE \nANDY Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love. \nMIKE I hope that's the cousin. \nBrody is trying to reason with an indignant fat man. \nINDIGNANT MAN I can't watch the news, I can't watch a ball game, I can't watch movies -- all I hear is that rotten kid with his rotten radio... \"Breaker, Breaker...\" \nBRODY I'll do what I can, but you're talking about a federal jurisdiction... \nINDIGNANT MAN (leaving in a huff) So call the FBI! \nPOLLY Black, two sugars. \nBRODY Thanks. What else is out there? \nPOLLY One petty theft, one domestic disturbance, and an exhibitionist. \nBRODY I'll take the exhibitionist, you handle the others. \nWOMAN Chief Brody? I want you to do something about my first husband. \nBrody is caught in the open. \nWHITE-HAIRED MAN Martin, you have got to demand that Grace Kinney keep her shades down. \n2ND MAN What about enforcing the \"No Parking\" ordinance on Beach Road? \nBRODY In a minute, in a minute -- talk to Mrs. Prendergast, please... \nWOMAN (continuing) Albert keeps coming around when I'm with gentlemen friends and he throws mud on their cars... \n2ND MAN (eager to be heard) Every time there's an out- of-state car in my driveway, I lose another mailbox. Those little iron sailboats cost thirty-two dollars each! \nBRODY (to White Haired Man) Talk to me about Mrs. Kinney. \nWHITE-HAIRED MAN Her bedroom window faces my oldest boy's bedroom, and she's teasing him, dancing around in a towel, or less... \nBRODY Dancing? \nHendricks has entered, carrying the camera brought up from the bottom by the divers. \nHENDRICKS Chief... \nBRODY Hendricks. I want to go over your reports and your Form 908. \nThey go into Brody's inner office; the uproar continues behind the door, but it's calm in here. \nHENDRICKS I never heard of a 908. \nBRODY I just made it up. It means, \"Get me out of there.\" (notices the camera) What the hell's that? \nHENDRICKS Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser. \nBRODY Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that. \nHENDRICKS Rich people. Home port is Newport, Rhode Island. \nBRODY If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel. \nHENDRICKS If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation. \nHendricks puts the camera in an informal \"Lost & Found\" box sitting in the office. Brody makes the mistake of opening the door, revealing the White-Haired Man. \nWHITE-HAIRED MAN Grace Kinney is driving my boy to distraction. \nBRODY Hendricks, get a description of that dance. \nLARGE MAN (to Brody) Chief Brody? I want to talk to you about my daughter... she's 15, but mature for her age... \nWOMAN Chief, I've been telling Mrs. Prendergast that it's no good just talking about Albert, she's got to do something... \n2ND MAN Look -- the township is responsible for protecting life and property, and my property is unprotected... \nAs Brody turns to deal with the mess, we: \nCUT TO: \nUNDERWATER \nLooking up at the surface, where a hull floats in silhouette against the daylight. There's a commotion, and a water ski drops into view. Then another one. Pale legs churn the water. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OCEAN - DAY \nOff Amity Beach, a bilious green lap-straked boat is bobbing in the water, the engine idling. Two girls are fooling around; the one in the water is Terry, the one driving the boat is Diane. \nTERRY Did you ever see a dolphin? \nDIANE Sure. They like to play. We may see some today. \nTERRY Great! \nShe fumbles with her skis. \nTERRY Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play with the dolphins without skis... \nDIANE Ready? \nTERRY Hang on, hang on... Okay, go. \nDiane goes to the controls, and puts the engine into gear, starting forward. Terry waves \"okay,\" Diane opens up the throttle, the boat surges forward, pulling Terry upright. \nA wake boils out from under her skis. \nANGLE ON THE BEACH \nEd and Tina are camped on a blanket, necking in the shelter of the dunes. There's a portable radio, a cooler with some beer, and some sandwiches -- a perfect afternoon alone. Above the dune, behind them lies the ocean, where the girls' ski boat can be seen, raising a big wake. Tina disengages, and sits up, brushing sand out of her hair. \nTINA Take a break for a minute, okay? \nED Huh? \nEXT. OCEAN - DAY \nSitting snug and ship-shape on Mike's Green Machine are Mike, Andy, Brooke, and Jackie. They are heeled over in a brisk wind, making good headway; sailing nearby in the b.g. are Patrick and Lucy and Donny and Denise, in their boats. \nLUCY (from her boat) Where're we going? \nANDY Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse. \nBROOKE The lighthouse? \nANDY No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic. \nMIKE We got some stuff at the store. Ed and Tina are going to be there. \nBROOKE Oh, sure, they would be. \nJACKIE What's the lighthouse? \nMIKE It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse. We sometimes hang out there, you know... \nJACKIE Great. I got some wine. \nShe opens her big floppy bag, revealing the top half of a jug of Mountain Red. Brooke slides over to her. \nANGLE ON BROOKE AND JACKIE \nBROOKE (aside) The lighthouse is a make-out spot. \nJACKIE Now I really want to see it. \nBROOKE You going to fool around with Mike? (Jackie shrugs) Well, I'm not doing anything with him. \nShe indicates Andy, who pretends great indifference. \nJACKIE Well, maybe I will, then. \nAndy does about a triple take before he regains his cool. \nMike concentrates on his sailing, Jackie grins an impish, vixen grin, Brooke shrugs. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAY \nspectacular view from the top of the old lighthouse, showing ocean, sandy beach, some of the Kids' catamarans pulled up on the sand, other pleasure boats cruising in the b.g. \nEd and Tina are running down the stairs, laughing. \nED Come on back up here! \nTINA Nope. \nED Give me back my hat! \nTINA Double nope! \nANGLE ON THE SAND \nwhere Andy, Mike, Jackie, and Brooke are camped around a blanket listening to a portable radio. Ed and Tina run by. \nANDY Why'd they decide to move? \nBROOKE Too hot in the lighthouse? \nMIKE Too hot for those two? I can't believe it. \nJACKIE Is there something I don't know about? \nBROOKE I told you, remember? \nJACKIE Oh, yeah. So why aren't they doing it now? \nThere's a little round of giggling. \nANDY Maybe by now they are. \nMIKE They're moving pretty fast. \nJACKIE He's cute... \nANGLE ON ED & TINA \nrunning towards a dune and over it. \nANGLE ON MASSIVE SHAPE \nin f.g., covered with birds. Ed and Tina appear over the crest of a dune, and the frame explodes in a flurry of seagulls, suddenly disturbed. The whir and drumbeat of wings, and the shrieking of the gulls is a jarring shock. \nCLOSEUP - TINA \nreacting. \nTINA Yech! \nHER POINT OF VIEW \nThe huge hulk of a beached, decomposing dead whale, a few birds still pecking at scraps of blubber and entrails. Big festering red holes mark its sides. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLONG SHOT -  SAND AND WHALE \nFrom the top of the lighthouse, we can see a group of interested spectators, clustered around the whale like ants at a picnic. A few more boats are beached and riding at anchor just off the shore, including the Amity police boat. \nThree Ants are walking towards the crowd, one of them gesturing. \nCUT TO: \nANGLE ON BRODY, HENDRICKS AND A WOMAN \nELKINS Not necessarily. These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. None of them are immediately fatal. Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further. \nHENDRICKS (chiming in) We got a helluva tide this month. \nBRODY Could you just keep that crowd back, please? \nMIKE (fidgeting) Pop... \nBRODY You stay right here. You're going in with me. \nANGLE ON BRODY AND MIKE \nAs Elkins examines the whale, calling her observations to Hendricks. \nMIKE We came out in my boat. \nBRODY Andy can sail in it. \nMIKE I got a date! \nBRODY She'll understand. \nMIKE She won't. \nELKINS Lower jaw displaced and lacerated by predator attempt to seize the tongue. Additional large tissue loss in the dorsal and sub- dorsal areas, as well as the caudal. Oriamal bite radius 37 inches, allowing for salt-water erosion and subsequent small predator and scavenger tissue attacks... \nThe Kids have moved a little closer to hear what's going on between father and son. \nBRODY I don't want to discuss it. \nElkins crosses to Brody. \nELKINS It's either a Great White, or another killer whale. \nBRODY Can't you tell? \nELKINS Not when it's like this. This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least. Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite. \nBRODY Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate? Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an enemy... \nELKINS Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally. \nMIKE Dad, please... \nBrody turns on him.  This at least, is something he can do something about. \nBRODY No more sailing. You come back with me, and that's it. \nMIKE Why me? \nBRODY Because I say so. \nANDY I'll tie up at the town dock, don't worry, man. \nJACKIE See you later, Mikey... \nED AND TINA Later, bye... (ad lib) \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. AMITY TOWN HALL - DAY \nVaughn and Brody enter, walking through the spare, empty town meeting hall, towards the conference table. They are alone. \nVAUGHN I'm showing summer rentals. We got a helluva season going. \nBRODY We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone. \nVAUGHN We're alone. \nBRODY Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one. \nVaughn stares at him, then unlocks the door to his private office -- \"Mayor\" -- and leads Brody in. \nINT. VAUGHN'S OFFICE - DAY \nSmall, expensively furnished in antiques, with a few symbols of Amity boosterism cluttering one wall: a photo of the beach, featuring a shark tower; an architect's rendering of the new Holiday Inn, some charts and graphs showing upward progress, a few stills of businessmen's luncheons, plaques, awards, etc. \nVAUGHN Are you serious? \nBRODY Of course. Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator... \nVAUGHN No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing. Be realistic. \nBRODY I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you? \nVAUGHN Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money. \nBRODY We have to do something. \nVAUGHN We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know. \nBRODY I know, I know... \nVAUGHN And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches! In New England? We all lost on that one. \nBRODY It's still a good idea. \nVAUGHN Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have everything you want; right now, the town's broke. \nBRODY Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers... \nVAUGHN (interrupting) A tragedy. But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident. \nBRODY Two of them are still missing! \nVAUGHN There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up. Are they all shark victims? \nBRODY Maybe they are! \nBRODY You got it. \nThe Deputy rummages in the locker, happy to be on the trail. \nHENDRICKS I know just where to go. \nBRODY Not the drugstore! \nHENDRICKS Of course not, They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me. \nBRODY The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it? \nHENDRICKS Nine-thirty, ten maybe. \nBRODY Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay? \nAnd he runs for the door, the speed-loaders with the Cyanide bullets safely in his pocket. \nBRODY (at the door) Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone. \nHENDRICKS Right. \nBrody pats his pockets to make sure the speed-loaders are safe inside, then exits. As Hendricks watches him go, \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT \nBrody's jeep pulls up, and he gets out, beat. He is slouching towards the door when he hears the phone ring inside. He perks up, and starts to move faster. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT \nEllen is on the phone in the den as Brody enters the house. \nThe Kids are on the floor in front of the TV, playing an electronic video game that pings and beeps softly under the following. \nELLEN (into the phone) Thank you. I'll tell him. \nBRODY For me? \nELLEN (hanging up) Sort of -- Matthew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring. \nBRODY Damn. \nHe starts upstairs, casually concealing the towel-wrapped package of gun and ammunition. \nMIKE Is Hooper coming to dinner? \nBRODY Not till next year. \nHe goes upstairs, Ellen waits a few beats, then follows him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BRODY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT \nBrody comes up the stairs and goes into the bedroom, where he carefully puts the gun in the bed table. Ellen finds him. \nBRODY Oh, hi -- How was dinner? \nELLEN Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you? \nBRODY (getting up) Santos' place. \nThey both know what that means -- the morgue. Brody goes into the bathroom and starts scrubbing his hands compulsively. \nINT. BRODY HOUSE - BATHROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT \nEllen follows Brody, watches as he washes under too-hot water. \nBRODY Oww! \nELLEN Careful. What's wrong? \nBRODY Nothing. \nELLEN Nothing, huh? \nBRODY That's what I said. Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff? \nELLEN Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos'? \nBRODY Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal. \nELLEN Oh. Want to talk about it? \nBRODY No. \nELLEN Terrific. \nMike comes up the stairs, and is starting into his room when Brody spots him; Sean is just behind him. \nBRODY Michael. \nMIKE Yeah? \nBRODY You want to come here a minute? \nMike shrugs and crosses to his father; Sean whizzes past on into his room. \nSEAN Hi Dad. \nBRODY Hiya yourself. \nMIKE What is it? \nHe expects something: this is a formal audience with the Head of The House. \nON THE WATER \nLarry Vaughn, Jr. comes skimming in close to the surf. Bob is handling the sheets, Larry is giving young Jackie sailing lessons -- at the moment he's showing her how the tiller works.  He's on her like glue. \nJACKIE This is fun! Can we go faster? \nLARRY (to Bob) Trim. \nBob does, Larry trims the main, and the hull lifts. \nJACKIE Yay! \nShe snuggles in Larry's arms. He waves to someone. \nLARRY That's my dad! \nJackie waves without seeing. \nON THE BEACH \nVaughn waves back, preoccupied. Near him, Mike Brody looks up, his face grim, jealous, and now a little nuts. He splashes paint onto the wood with angry abandon. \nVAUGHN (to Peterson) Wave to my son. \nPETERSON (waving) How the hell do we get him down from there? \nVAUGHN Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus. \nMrs. Bryant approaches them, tugging her daughter. \nMRS. BRYANT Renee wants to know what that man is doing way up there? \nPETERSON He's, ah, watching. A lookout. \nMRS. BRYANT For what? \nRENEE (a precocious little girl) It's a shark tower. I saw one in Florida. He's looking for sharks. \nVAUGHN It's an observation platform. That's our Chief of Police. He's just checking it. \nPETERSON Normally, it's used for, ah, bird watching. Nature observation. Weather measurements, that sort of thing. (a little desperate) Ellen, we're running late! \nELLEN Okay. Folks, if we could get back on, we'll show you the country club, and stop for lunch... \nAt the mention of lunch, the prospects, all hungry, begin flocking back into the van. Peterson herds them along. \nPETERSON The country club has an 18-hole course, putting greens, and twelve tennis courts... \nCUT TO: \nBRODY IN THE TOWER \nstill scanning. His body suddenly tenses. There's something out there. He mashes his binoculars to his eyes, trying to get a better look. \nHIS POINT OF VIEW (PROCESS) \nThrough the binoculars, something big and black, moving under the buoys and into the swimming area. \nBRODY AGAIN \nHe can't believe it. But looking past him, we can see it with the unaided eye: a seething dark mass, moving through the water towards the unprotected bathers. \nBRODY (screaming) Out of the water! Everyone out of the water! \nNo one can hear him. A few little faces look up, unable to catch what he's saying. He starts climbing down the ladder shouting. \nBRODY Get out of the water! Tell everyone to get out! Now! Out of the water! \nANGLE ON PETERSON, VAUGHN, AND NICHOLS \nreacting. \nVAUGHN (recalling another panic) Oh, my God... \nPETERSON What the hell is he doing? \nNICHOLS Oh, no! \nELLEN, MIKE, AND SEAN \nLooking up, startled at Brody's sudden panic. \nTHE WATER \nThe dark mass almost on top of the swimmers, who are starting to look around. Most of them are oblivious to what's happening on shore. \nFOLLOW BRODY \nas his feet hit the sand and he starts running for the water, fumbling for his gun and the speed-loader with the cyanide bullets. He is bumping into people, knocking little kids over, stepping on blankets and umbrellas, a madman. \nBRODY Out of the water! Now! Everyone! \nVAUGHN \nRunning too, half-stumbling, half-believing, remembering... \nELLEN \nMoving after her husband, while Mike steadies Sean, holding the impulsive kid back. \nELLEN (seeing something) Martin! No! \nANGLE ON BRODY AGAIN \nThe gun is out now, he's trying draw a bead on the shape in the water; chest heaving, he tries to steady his shaky grip. People see the gun and scream, throwing themselves flat on the sand, running, some of them going into the water. \nBRODY No! Don't go in! Stay out! Stay clear! \nHe fires. Again. Bullets ricochet off the water, howling towards the horizon. Real panic now. Four more shots. \nHe tosses the photo sloppily on the desk. \nELLEN What? \nBRODY What'd I say? \nELLEN That you were fired. \nBRODY Then that's what I meant. Fired. Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police. Just like that. \nELLEN Because of today? The beach? \nBRODY (expansively) No sweat. A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat... we're surrounded by water here, you realize that? Me, surrounded by water... Ridiculous. \nELLEN Stop that! We're not going any place. You love it here. Tell me what the hell happened! \nBRODY Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it. Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture... He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me... \nELLEN (studying the photo) Honey, this is nothing... I don't know what it is. What did they... \nBRODY (going on) ...Everybody wants the job. No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks. Fine. He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me. Call me in New York... tell him to kiss my ass... \nELLEN (seeing his pain) They have no right to treat you like that. You've given them everything. For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island... \nBRODY Fired me! (at Ellen) I'm not a hysterical man. I'm responsible. I know what I saw... \nELLEN I know you did... \nBRODY I try. Goddamnit, I tried... Now, I'm tired... I can't keep fighting it... I'm too tired... I'm... I'm... \nBrody's slipping under; the beers and the day have finally overcome him. He slumps in Ellen's arms. \nELLEN You're drunk is what you are... \nShe eases him onto the couch, tucking a comforter over his inert shape. \nELLEN Take it easy... Easy... \nANGLE ON THE STAIRWELL \nSean comes down the stairs, sleepy, in his pajamas. \nSEAN Is dad home? I heard something... \nHe comes into the darkened den. \nELLEN AND SEAN \nELLEN Shhhh. Go back upstairs. Daddy's sleeping. \nSean finds the photo, and stares at it idly. \nSEAN What's this? \nELLEN Nothing, sweetheart. Seaweed. \nShe takes him by his sleepy hand and leads him out of the room, leaving Brody tucked in on the couch, dead to the world. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NEWSSTORE - NIGHT \nThis is the Amity teen-ager's hangout -- a newsstand and pinball arcade with a minimal refreshment counter where soft drinks and submarine sandwiches are dispensed. A jukebox is blaring some n.d. rock music. Present are Donnie, Doug, Timmy, Bob, Larry Vaughn Jr., Brooke, Marge, Denise, Jane, Andy, and Mike. The boys are passing around hot-rod van and custom boat magazines; the girls are looking at Silver Screen, Tiger Beat, People, and Time. Andy and Mike are at the counter, splitting a sandwich. \nDOUG (holding a book) That's what I want -- a gaff rig. \nTIMMY Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail schooner? Go anywhere. Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner. \nBOB Hey, Mike -- I saw your dad over at the town hall. \nMIKE I know. \nDOUG (innocently) Did he really freak out at the beach? \nMIKE I don't know. \nANDY Hey, it's all bullshit. Anyone want to play pong for money? \nNo one does. There's a bustle at the door, and some couples enter from the movies: Patrick and Lucy, Ed and Tina, Polo and Jackie. There are a lot of ad-lib greetings; \nLARRY How was the show? \nED Yech. \nTINA It was okay. \nPATRICK I'd rather go the lighthouse. \nLUCY Who wouldn't. \nPOLO Anyone want to go the lighthouse? \nBROOKE Now? At night? \nPOLO Nah. Tomorrow. Early, spend the day. My folks left two cases of beer in the garage. \nPATRICK Is it still there? \nPOLO Nope. Got it in my boat. \nLUCY All-right. \nJACKIE Let's go for it. \nThere's a general ad-lib agreement to organize a day's sailing picnic. \nTINA Mike, you going? \nMIKE Why shouldn't I? \nBRODY Mike left early. Couldn't wait to make out. Must be a morning man. \nEllen and Brody sip their coffee quietly for a few moments. \nMrs. Silvera arrives, carrying groceries. \nMRS. SILVERA Morning. Anything special today? \nELLEN Sean's not up yet. You know what he likes, just some Fruit Loops and milk. No candy. \nBRODY The sink upstairs is busted. Try some Drano, or a plunger, maybe. Or call your brother, the plumber, what's his name... \nMRS. SILVERA Frankie. He's my cousin. \nBRODY Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs an apprentice. \nBrody and Ellen are at the door. \nMRS. SILVERA Have a nice day. \nThey leave. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY \nThe Kids are into their boats, fitting out for a day of recreational offshore sailing. Mike and Andy are readying his Tornado, while Sean gets in the way. In the b.g., Hendricks can be seen puttering around on the Amity police boat. \nANDY If you're beached, why are we doing this? For practice? \nMIKE Yeah. \nANDY Then why are we futzing around the dock? We can make a few bucks working at the beach. \nSean knocks something over, Mike snaps at him. \nMIKE Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home. \nSEAN I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in the way? \nANDY You're always in the way. \nMarge joins them, scooping Sean up. \nMARGE This guy giving you any trouble? \nSEAN Put me down! \nANDY Put him down in the water. \nMARGE (to Sean) You want to go out in my boat? \nSEAN Yeah. \nMIKE Would you take him? \nMARGE Sure. \nANDY You've just made someone very happy. \nMarge and Sean go over to her Lightening. Brooke and Jackie come down the dock, dressed for sailing. \nBROOKE Mike! Are you going out? \nMIKE Maybe. \nJACKIE I thought you were grounded. \nMIKE I can go out if I want to. \nANDY You can? \nJACKIE You going to the lighthouse? \nMIKE Why not? \nANDY I could give you a dozen good reasons. \nMIKE (to Andy) Shut up. \nANDY Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you. \nJACKIE Is there room on your boat for all of us? \nMike looks: Andy, Jackie, Brooke, himself... Timmy moves in, sensing the chance of a lifetime. \nANDY Well, we're pretty crowded, and I don't know when we're leaving... \nTimmy makes his move. \nTIMMY I've got room. \nBROOKE Great. (to Andy) That's okay -- I'll go with Timmy. \nTIMMY You will? \nBROOKE Sure. \nAnd she walks towards his boat, looking back for him to follow. He's dumbstruck by his sudden good fortune. \nTIMMY Fan-tas-tic! \nHe runs to join her, untying mooring lines like crazy; they're together again at last for the first time. Andy is left shuffling with Mike and Jackie. \nJACKIE I'm ready. \nAnd she plops down in Mike's boat, ready to be taken. Anywhere. \nJACKIE Come on, you guys. \nDECK OF THE DIVING BOAT - DAY \nAndrews is on his side, bloody froth on his lips. One of the class is clinging to his legs, trying to arrest his convulsions. Sparky is holding his shoulders, trying to administer mouth-to-mouth. \nSPARKY Get us in! For Christ's sake, get us in! \nIn his arms, Andrews writhes, pain knotting his limbs. \nBehind them, in the water, the fin surfaces, and casually turns towards... the ocean. The Shark is headed for the sea. And for the now distant Kids in their sailboats, dotting the horizon in their familiar bright colors. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OCEAN - ED AND TINA'S SANDPIPER - DAY \nThey are alone. In the middle distance, the rest of the Kids' sails can be seen, headed for the lighthouse in the distance. The Sandpiper's sails are luffing, they're making no headway. \nTINA You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this? \nED (snuggling close) Just like this. \nTINA What about sailing? \nED The tide's running. It'll take us to the light. \nTINA It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful. \nEd is lashing the rudder as they continue to drift with the current. \nED First things first. \nHe fumbles in a cooler chest, produces a bottle of wine. \nTINA What about the others? \nED They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started. \nTINA What're we going to do in the mean time? \nED I dunno. We'll think of something. \nHe pours the wine into the two paper cups. \nED But first, a little juice... \nTINA And second? \nED (kissing her) Mmmmmm. \nTINA (resisting) Wait a minute. Promise me something. \nED Anything. Anything. \nTINA That you'll put down a blanket. I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them. \nED You got it. \nAnd he fumbles for a blanket in a locker, thumping and banging gear around as he rummages for it. Tina sips wine contentedly, satisfied to wait. \nUNDERWATER \nThe Sandpiper's hull, alone above us, as the Shark rises with dreadful certainty, attracted by the erratic sounds of Ed's hasty search. \nANGLE ON TINA - WATCHING THE OCEAN \nThe terrible fin breaks the surface, about 20 yards out, then dips and disappears. Then, impossibly fast, the entire Sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge, as the Shark lunges up against it from below, an unseen horror. \nEd is knocked over the side, into the water. \nANGLE ON ED \nas he breaks the surface, shaking the hair out of his eyes, trying to orient himself, finding the boat. He starts to swim for it, Tina extending an arm to help him climb aboard. \nANGLE OVER THE GUNWALE, TOWARDS ED \nHe has barely taken two strokes when a powerful force takes him from below the surface, rushing him towards us through the water. Tina screams. Before Ed can react to the pain, he is slammed face first into the boat. His jaw breaks, blood smears his nose and lip. \nHis hands grab the wooden-cap rail with a death-grip. \nREVERSE \nTina is staring down at the water, terror-stricken; Ed's arms and head are f.g., as he locks onto the boat with desperate hands. \nINSERT \nEd's hands on the rail, knuckles white, an iron grip. With awful finality, the force pulls down, and the wood shatters and splits away as Ed's hands are pulled down and under by the awful force. \nTINA \nher mouth working silently, unable to scream, staring down at the blood and froth on the water, swirling in a grim eddy under her, the Sandpiper rocking gently in the diminishing swell. \nEXT. OCEAN - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT \nOn the way to the lighthouse, but away from the harbor, the Kids are sailing in fairly close order: The sloops (Polo, Timmy, Marge) heeled well over in the stiff breeze, the faster cats (Mike, Larry, Donny, etc.) skimming around, tacking more often, faster and more maneuverable. \nCLOSE ON PATRICK AND LUCY \nLUCY Faster! Faster! \nPATRICK Coming about... \nShe ducks under the boom, handling the jib sheets with easy familiarity. They come about and scoot off on a new tack. \nCLOSE ON POLO \nReading the wind, trimming sail expertly, competent and alone. \nPOLO (to a near-by boat) Great day! I think the wind's going to change... \nCLOSE ON TIMMY AND BROOKE \nIt approaches the sailboats, losing altitude fast, rotor blades chuffing up a storm. \nThe Pilot has his microphone to his lips, and his voice is blaring down at them. \nPILOT (V.O.) This is the Harbor Patrol. Return to port immediately. Return -- to -- port -- immediately. \nTHE BOATS \nThe Kids look at each other, some coming about awkwardly, others luffing, wondering what this is all about. \nANDY (to Mike) Your dad must be really pissed. \nMIKE We better go back in. \nANDY It's not going to be easy. \nJACKIE What's wrong? \nMIKE We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide. \nANDY Putz -- that won't be for hours. \nMIKE I was counting on hours. \nCHOPPER (V.O.) Return -- to -- port. \nMIKE We're trying, we're trying. \nHe waves acknowledgement, and puts about. The others take their cue from him, and set a rough course back, but without much success. \nPATRICK AND LUCY \nLUCY Heading back? \nPATRICK Might as well. \nANGLE ON THE THREE SLOOPS \nPolo, Timmy and Brooke, Marge and Sean. They see the faster catamarans come about and try to beat back. \nPOLO They're turning around. \nLUCY Coming about, then. \nSEAN Are we going back? \nMARGE Going to try. Lighthouse, everybody... \nShe puts about, the three of them start back towards the lighthouse, not making much headway. Doug's inflatable is the slowest, and he is now, by virtue of his position, at the head of the line beating back towards the island. \nDOUG'S BOAT \nThe others in the b.g. \nDOUG Make way for the Carrier Enterprise! \nINSERT - A WEAK PATCH IN THE RUBBER \nIt whistles and visibly leaks under the strain. \nDOUG \nlooking down in dismay. \nDOUG Make that the Titanic. \nHe rigs a little foot pump, and begins thumping away, trying to breath air back into the raft. \nINT. CHOPPER - LOOKING DOWN AT THE SAILBOATS \nPILOT Patrol One to Base. Looks like they're turning back. \nCONTROL All right, Patrol. Go back to work. You've wasted enough time. \nUNDERWATER \nLooking up at the scattered hulls of the sailboats, the turbulence from the low-flying chopper making a vast circular pattern of irregular vibrations. \nLOOKING UP AT THE CHOPPER \nIt wheels around, and heads back towards land. \nCUT TO: \nABOARD THE AMITY POLICE BOAT - DAY \nRushing through the seas under full power. About three hundred yards ahead, a small, seemingly empty sailboat; Ed and Tina's Sandpiper. Further off, a day-sailing power cruiser, sport fishing. \nELLEN Michael? \nBRODY It's not his boat. \nHendricks maneuvers closer, slowing the engine, reversing in time to bring them alongside with a gentle bump. Ellen watches apprehensively as Brody drops into the little boat. \nELLEN Be careful... \nHENDRICKS Anything? \nBRODY (on the Sandpiper) Nope... (he sees something) Hold on... \nBrody moves around on the deck of the Sandpiper, until he discovers Tina, cowering in shock; a sudden revealing of a terrorized victim. \nBRODY Tina! \nTINA (a moan) N-o-o-o-o-o-o... \nBRODY It's okay, it's okay. What's the matter? Tina? Honey? Hey -- \nTINA No! It's still there! \nMARGE How about a skyhook? \nDOUG You sail your boat, I'll sail mine. \nA fin rises partially, almost invisible to most of the kids, but Mike notices it, believing it to be a porpoise. \nMIKE Hey, Fetterman -- You got company. \nDOUG Company? The place is a mess... \nBefore anyone can react, the shape rises behind Doug, striking his raft a terrible blow. \nDOUG Whoops. \nCUT TO: \nTHE OTHERS, WATCHING \nNot making any headway themselves, they casually watch the class clown, wondering what he's up to this time. \nDOUG'S BOAT \na distance from the rest. It shakes, then blows up as big teeth grip it from below. Doug goes flying into the drink. \nThe Shark has the inflatable in his teeth, and is shaking it from side to side. Doug's eyes bug out as he sees what's going on. He begins treading water, backing away as fast as he can, waving his arm in the air frantically -- \"pick me up, quick...\" \nMIKE'S BOAT \nMIKE Doug's down! \nHe sails to where Doug is being carried along by the current. \nThe inflatable is a mess -- shredded rubber and dead engine; the Shark didn't like it. \nANDY Doug! This way! \nDoug carefully -- oh, so carefully -- strokes over to where Mike and Andy can pull him abroad. Some of the others sail closer to get a look. \nPATRICK What was that about? \nMARGE You okay? \nLUCY What was that? \nLARRY So much for the rubber duck. \nTHE GROUP, DRIFTING TOGETHER \nThis incident hasn't yet touched them -- no one actually saw what it was, except Doug, who's never been serious about anything. Until now. \nDOUG A shark ate my boat. \nBOB Come on. \nDOUG I'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate my goddamn boat! \nANDY If he liked your boat, I got some sneakers he'll love. \nThere's nervous laughter from all around as they examine the remains of Doug's inflatable. Some of those jagged rents could be made by teeth... \nKIDS (ad lib) ...Jeez -- what did that?... A porpoise, maybe...Nah, killer whale... I think he snagged it... I hate to pop his balloon... (Etc.) \nANGLE ON MIKE'S BOAT \nDoug's inflatable is draped over the tip of one hull, forward. \nWithout warning, the Shark hits. Screams, terror, confusion. \nMike, Andy, Jackie into the water. \nCLOSE ON MIKE \nHis head bangs on a metal fitting as the boat turns over. \nON THE GROUP \nPatrick and Lucy ram into Timmy's boat, locking into it, knocking Timmy into the water as Brooke screams. \nCONFUSION \nAs the following events take place: \n--  Larry's red cat rams and locks onto Mike's Tornado. \n--  Marge's boat capsizes, putting Sean and Marge into the drink. \n--  Marge scrambles up on the over-turned hull, pulling Sean up with her, just in time. \n--  Polo, under full sail, scoops Mike out of the water before the Shark can get to him. \n--  The Shark dips out of sight. \nSURFACE, WIDE OVER THE STERN OF POLO'S BOAT \nshowing the results of the turmoil: \nANGLE ON THE SURVIVORS \nAs they make ineffectual, frightened moves towards grouping together, Andy is the first to gain any composure. \nANDY Raft up! Raft 'em up! \nHe reaches towards a drifting line, and pulls Timmy's Doughdish towards them, tying it off as it comes close. \nLARRY Tie off to your strongest point. \nPATRICK Anyone need an extra line? \nPolo has Mike and Timmy aboard his boat.  Timmy is looking up from examining Mike's dazed body. \nPATRICK First we got to get there. \nLARRY How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...? \nBOB Anyone got another set of sails? \nThe Kids scramble to rig whatever canvas is available. \nSEAN Is that big thing still out there? \nMARGE Shhhh. \nCUT TO: \nHELICOPTER (AERIAL) FLY-BY \nA panorama of open ocean; a quick fly-by to orient us: First, Cable Junction, then, a mile or so ahead, the raft. \nTHE RAFT \nMore sail, some improvised rigging, Patrick and Lucy trimming what there is, trying to steer the clumsy contraption. From afar, the distant sound of an approaching chopper. \nLARRY Hey! \nBOB (waving) Over here! \nThe Kids react with enthusiasm to the arrival of the rescue chopper. \nANDY Don't everyone jump around! \nBut they ignore him. The copter is descending. \nINT. COPTER - DAY \nA one-man light spotter; the space next to the pilot cluttered with tools and floats, lashed in place. Below, seen through the plastic bubble, the raft growing larger as the chopper sets down. \nPILOT Air One to Base. I have a positive location on that sailing party. Disabled and adrift... (he checks chart on his knee board) ...about 3/4 miles west of Cable Junction, wind and current carrying them just about due east. I count ten juveniles. \nTHE RAFT \nThe helicopter is creating a lot of turbulence as it sets down, a huge circular pattern of prop-wash on the surface as the rotors slow to a halt. The Kids are waving and jubilant. \nANGLE ON THE COPTER \nAs the Pilot unbuckles, opens the door, and steps out on one pontoon; he speaks through a bullhorn. \nPILOT Everyone okay? Any injuries? \nThe Kids ad-lib in the affirmative. \nANDY Can you put us on Cable Junction? \nPILOT I got no room for passengers. \nANDY How about a tow? Can you rig that? \nThe Pilot nods. Larry heaves a line to him, the Pilot catches it and makes it fast to a convenient tie-off on the undercarriage. \nLARRY As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in. My dad's the mayor... \nANDY (interrupting) There's a shark... \nThe other Kids all chime in, adding their ad-lib shouts describing what happened, calling for help, etc. It's all a noisy jumble, the Pilot ignores it, trying to do his job. \nANGLE ON THE RAFT \nThe Kids all shouting at once; Jackie is screaming. \nJACKIE You have to take us off! You have to! Why don't you take us! \nDOUG (calming her) It's an observation spotter, he doesn't have the room... \nANGLE ON THE PILOT \nHe finishes tying off, and yells through his bullhorn at the Kids. \nPILOT Listen. I'm going to give you an assist to get you on Cable Junction. Then I'll call in, and get the Coast Guard to send a cutter. Hang on to something. \nHe climbs into his bubble, shuts the door, gives the Kids a \"thumbs up,\" and starts the engine. \nQUICK CUTS - RAFT AND CHOPPER \nEngine turning over. \nA line tied off to one of the ringbolts on an overturned hull; it pulls taut out of the water. \nINT. CHOPPER, THE PILOT INTENT ON HIS JOB. \nThe raft, Kids watching in fascination and anticipation. \nThe whole operation, getting under way. \nUNDERWATER \nlooking up at pontoons, wreckage, wind turbulence on the surface, the heavy \"thud-thud-thud\" of chopper blades. \nWIDE ON THE RAFT AND CHOPPER \nIn the f.g., the fin rises, and starts for the scene. \nFollow it. \nCLOSE ON THE CHOPPER \nas it starts to lift, inexplicably. The Pilot reacts as; \nTHE SHARK \nattacks one of the pontoons, biting down on it, clamping great scarred jaws onto the bulbous floats. \nCUT TO: \nON THE SURFACE - THE RAFT \nA parallel struggle for survival, as the current separates Sean from the other Kids; Marge is gone, the little boy is clinging alone to the free-floating Lightening. \nPATRICK Sean! Sean! \nANDY Don't move! \nSEAN Andy! Please help! Help! \nON THE SURFACE - A DISTANCE AWAY \nCopter wreckage is bubbling up from underneath, like a submarine destroyed by depth charges; an oil slick, pieces of broken blade, a seat cushion, then, suddenly, the Pilot, and Marge, almost choked to death, their air run out. They cling to a section of pontoon, panting, looking around with oxygen-starved eyes. \nThey are alone on the ocean; a half-mile away, the distant sails of the broken raft, and the low-lying shape of Cable Junction. Safe, for now... \nCUT TO: \nBRODY - ALONE IN THE POLICE BOAT - DAY \nHe throttles down, and the boat slumps in the water. He looks around, sees nothing, in all directions. He hits his radio. \nBRODY Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One, come in. \nStatic, no answer. He tries a couple of times, checking the knobs and dials to make sure the unit's working. \nBRODY Harbor Air, do you read? Over? \nPATROL VOICE Brody? This is Patrol Base. \nThe familiar voice is tinged with annoyance. He's had a long shift, and nothing's going right. \nBRODY Where the hell is Air One? \nPATROL VOICE That's what I'd like to know. Lost transmission at Cable Junction. \nBRODY Did he raise the Kids? \nPATROL VOICE Last transmission said ten juveniles. \nBRODY Yeah? Then what? \nPATROL VOICE Then nothing. If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself. \nBRODY Did you say Cable Junction? \nPATROL VOICE That's what he said. \nBRODY When? \nPATROL VOICE 1530 hours. Might still be there. Base out. \nBrody revs up, and powers out, headed for Cable Junction. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE RAFT \nSean is crying on his isolated perch, clinging to the upturned keel. The other Kids are throwing a rope, trying to get him back. Patrick heaves, and misses. \nLARRY Sean! Catch the rope! \nBOB The rope! The rope! \nThe others shoot fearful glances at the waters. \nPATRICK He's got to help or it won't work. \nLUCY Sean, baby, please... \nSean is ignoring the efforts to rescue him, paralyzed by fear, he shivers alone. Jackie is near catatonia herself, Brooke and Doug trying to soothe her. \nJACKIE It killed her. It ate her. \nBROOKE Shh. Shhh... \nDOUG It's okay, it's okay... \nANDY Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean. \nThe kid looks up dully. \nANDY Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me? \nLUCY Listen to Andy, Sean. \nANDY We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear? \nSean nods. The other Kids are encouraged. The rope is thrown -- it misses. \nANDY (to Bob) Keep an eye out for that fish. \nBob climbs to a vantage point, watching. \nLARRY Throw it. \nANDY Sean! Catch it! \nAnother miss. In his haste to help, Larry overreaches to fish the trailing rope out of the water, and falls headlong into the sea. Shrieks of fright from the others. \nLUCY Larry! \nHe scrambles out, hardly wet, that's how fast he's moving. \nFinally -- Patrick takes the crucial throw, and the rope practically knocks Sean off his perch, but he clutches and holds it. As Andy carefully calls instructions, Sean secures the rope and the others carefully, carefully begin to pull him in. \nANGLE - ON SEAN \nBrody jerks the mooring line holding them together, freeing it. He starts for his controls, obsessed. \nMIKE Dad, I'm sorry... \nBRODY Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just stay here. \nHe indicates the lighthouse, then guns his engine. \nBRODY Stay at the lighthouse! \nHe roars off, headed towards Cable Junction. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE RAFT \napproaching Cable Junction the rafted boats are drifting towards the Cable Junction.  Larry, Patrick and Andy are working on improvised tiller lines to a jury rudder made out of wreckage. Lucy has another line out to a sea anchor, trying to slow their drift. \nANDY Bring her to port a little. That's it -- steady. \nDOUG I think we're changing course a little. \nBROOKE Can we land on it? \nLUCY If we can get to it. \nJACKIE We're going to die. \nBROOKE (comforting her) It's all right, we're okay. \nANDY More to port. \nBOB It's all the way over. \nANDY Shit. \nSEAN Are we going to go on the island? \nBROOKE You bet, kiddo. \nANDY (the realist) I don't know. \nLARRY What the hell, we're steering for it. \nDOUG The wind drift is lateral. \nLARRY What's that mean? \nDOUG Sideways -- For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way... \nHis hands illustrate the predicament. \nLUCY But we had it! We were headed right for it! \nANDY Shit. Shit, shit, shit! \nJACKIE We're going to miss it! \nThe others are silent. It's true. \nANGLE ON THE RAFT \nLarry, Bob and Brooke try to alter its course by padding. \nANDY Don't! \nDOUG Stop paddling! \nLUCY But the island! \nANDY The Shark. \nThey freeze, as the raft grinds against something. \nUNDERWATER \nThe inverted mast of one of the wrecked boats is snagged on the rocks on the bottom. \nANGLE ON THE RAFT \nas it slows, then stops, hung up from below. \nBROOKE What is it? \nANDY We're hung up on something. \nDOUG Maybe the bottom. \nJACKIE (hysteria) It's that thing. It's going to kill us now... We're going to die! \nLARRY Shut up! Just shut Up! \nBROOKE Leave her alone! \nBOB Lighten up, man... \nLARRY It's bad enough without her freaking out. \nPATRICK She's hysterical, goddamn it! \nLUCY Don't yell at her! \nThe group dissolves in bitter exchanges. No one is rational. \nLucy is the first to notice something... \nLUCY Wait a minute! Listen! Listen! \nThe group subsides, only Jackie is left, keening to herself. \nHe sees the winch and hooks on his launch, and makes the towline fast to the steel winch cable; puts it in neutral. \nThe Kids haul their line, trying to bring the steel cable to them. \nThe shark rams their raft, impatient now. Screams and scrambling as they let go their line and try to avoid the beast. Brooke huddles with Sean, Jackie cowers alone.

Pull! \nThey do, but now the winch cable is snagged under the surface. \nIt comes taut, but doesn't budge. Brody watches, helpless for the moment. \nBRODY Son of a bitch is stuck! \nBRODY \nclimbs back onto the boat, starts the winch engine, trying to pull the cable free. \nTHE SHARK \non the offensive now, takes an outrigger pontoon, biting it, tearing it off the raft, shaking everything. \nON THE RAFT \nthe Kids react to this fresh attack. \nDOUG It's killing us! \nJACKIE I don't want to die! Mommy! \nIN THE BOAT \nThe winch smokes and stalls, the weight it's pulling almost too much. \nBRODY Come on, you bastard, come on, pull. Pull! \nTHE RAFT \nbursts apart from the center as the Shark lunges up through the canvas trampoline of the Sizzler. The Kids, screaming, fall into the water as the attack forces the fragile structure into pieces. Only Sean, Brooke, and Jackie are left on the remaining segment. \nANGLE ON BRODY \nwatching the destruction, seeing Sean practically alone in the water. \nBRODY Sean! Hang on! \nHe looks around the deck frantically, spots a rubber emergency inflatable in its case. He wrestles it off its brackets, and breaks the seals urgently. He hits the auto-inflate. \nBRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN \nAlone on the raft, Brooke and Jackie helpless nearby, the other Kids flailing in the water. The huge bulk of the Shark, fin cutting the water as it closes in on the confusion. \nIN THE WATER \nWhile Brody inflates the rubber raft and throws it in the water, the Kids scramble for safety, swimming for their lives. Each one is sure this moment is going to be his last. \nANDY Get on the rocks! \nDOUG Swim for it! \nAndy is pulling himself towards the boat, scrambling up on the exposed wooden hull. \nPATRICK Lucy! Look out! \nANGLE ON LUCY AND BOB \nAs she looks over her shoulder and screams -- the monster is sliding past her, intent on Bob. The rough hide scrapes her, tearing her clothes, leaving raw bleeding lacerations on her torso. \nLUCY I'm bleeding! \nLarry and Patrick help her towards the rocks. \nBOB Help! \nHe's clinging to a piece of broken boat; the Shark lunges at him. \nINSERT - WINCH \ngrinding, smoking, hauling something out of the water -- heavy, slimy, dripping metal cable, the main powerline from the mainland! \nBRODY IN THE WATER \npaddling the raft towards Sean with desperate strokes, heedless of the danger around him. \nBRODY Hang on! Just hang on! \nHe fights to see in the gathering gloom. Suddenly, a strange glare snaps on, then more illumination, in a series of escalating clicks. \nCABLE JUNCTION \nSilhouetted against the evening sky. Automatic timers are turning on navigation and worklights, illuminating the barren rocks and rusty steel with their glare -- throwing dark shadows, putting the surrounding water into black limbo by their contract. \nANGLE ON BRODY \nstraining to see what's going on. Looking for his son. \nSEAN (O.S.) Dad! Help! Daddy! \nBRODY I'm coming! \nHe looks around desperately, sees Andy safe on the launch. \nBRODY Andy! Use the lights!

Mrs. Witherspoon is waiting in the b.g. \nNearby, we can see a sign: \"BURIED CABLE: Call New England Light and Power Before Digging.\" The cable itself surfaces in a chain-link fenced enclosure, and climbs a power pole for distribution to the island. Ed and Tina are also there, having given statements. \nBRODY There should be bodies. Witnesses say two people; one in the boat, one skiing. \nHENDRICKS (O.S.)

I don't care how long it takes. \nHENDRICKS (O.S.) \nBrody turns to Ed and Tina, and takes out his notebook. \nTINA We heard this noise, like a 'boomp' out there, and when we looked, there was just this cloud of smoke. \nGRACE That was the explosion. One minute they were having a wonderful time, the next, bang! \nBRODY \nGRACE I don't know what could've done that. \nBrody stares out at the quiet sea -- what's lurking under that calm surface? \nTINA Can we go now? \nBrody's still looking past them, towards the ocean. \nTINA Chief Brody -- can we go?

And cold. And most of all, bored. \nINSERT - THE WINCH CABLE \nIt goes taut with a sudden strain. \nANGLE ON HENDRICKS \nHe sees it, too. \nHENDRICKS I think we got something. \nRed moves to the winch, watching warily as it slows to a near stall with the weight. \nRED About damn time. \nHENDRICKS What the hell is it? \nThere's a strain on the cable -- it's pulling the stern of the boat down as it struggles with the weight. \nHENDRICKS Here it comes... \nANGLE ON THE WATER \nlit by the harsh worklights on the deck of the launch. The cable from the winch is taut, pulling something up from the black depths. What? The coupling appears, then the hook, and an oily cable. \nRED Oh shit. Drop it. \nHENDRICKS What is it? \nRED Power line. \nHENDRICKS Oh, great. \nHe hits the release on the winch, and the cable whines as it spins out and settles back on the bottom.

He's another one. \nELLEN One what? (she finds the book) Ah-ha! \nBRODY Boat nut. What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating? \nELLEN It's an island.

Look at the diffusion, though... \nBRODY What else you got? \nPHIL Let's see -- you got a minute? \nBRODY Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around. \nPHIL Okay, okay -- stand over there... \nHe gestures, Brody steps to one side of a table with some big enamel pans for washing and developing prints. Phil switches to a red light, and takes some printing paper, putting it under the enlarger. \nQUICK CUTS: \n--  Enlarger light going on. \n--  Timer ticking, the hand turning. \n--  Quick negative images: water, boat, diver, hand, boat again, tantalizing fragments of the opening sequence projected on the enlarger's flat base. \n--  Hypo and Developer sloshing in a pan under Phil's hands. \n--  Brody staring down. \nINSERT (PROCESS) \nQuietly gaining contrast in a pan of developer, a print of what at first looks like seaweed, then is unmistakably the grinning jaws of the Great White. \nSUBLIMINAL FLASH CUT - SHARK \nA quick nightmare vision of Brody, alone in a sinking Orca, trapped in a battered cabin interior; a Great White crashes through the glass, its head huge as it lunges. \nINSERT PHOTOGRAPH IN DEVELOPER (PROCESS) \nThe close-up detail of this otherwise blurred and unreadable photo is unmistakably a detail from a very close view of the snapping jaws of a Great White; if you hadn't seen it as a memory, it would make no sense at all. For Brody, the meaning is all too clear; for anyone who's never seen the monster face-to-face, it's nothing. \nBRODY (O.S.) (shaken) That one there.

Uh... sure... The question's out of left field. Why are they asking? \nNICHOLS So Jeff could handle things? He knows the routine, he has the authority? \nBRODY Yeah. Why? \nPETERSON It came up during the meeting. \nBRODY Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty. It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers.

Will you just listen to him? (to Brody) You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody decides to sue us? That could ruin us. \nBRODY Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? I'll pay for it. Take it out of my salary. \nPETERSON You don't make enough. \nBRODY Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way. \nPETERSON What's that supposed to mean? \nBRODY It means I don't like all that grab- ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.

It bumps the dock, hard. \nHENDRICKS You're too close. Back off. \nBRODY Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there. \nHendricks goes to the bow, jumps aboard and frees the bow line. The boat slips into reverse, the water boiling as Brody guns it away from the dock. \nHENDRICKS Let me. Please. \nHe takes the wheel, eases off on the rudder, and comes about, pointing the launch out to sea. \nELLEN Hurry, please. \nHENDRICKS What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?

GARE (getting panicked) C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't-- 
HECTOR I need to see his habitat. 
As he drops in. 
GARE Please.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water. 
HECTOR He's not gonna hurt me. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Kelly, Jack and Keough with Bickerman. 
BICKERMAN Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  No.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile... 
KEOUGH You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest. 
BICKERMAN Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat. 
GARE (O.S.) (through walkie-talkie) Hank!  We got a problem with Hector. 
KEOUGH (into walkie-talkie) What problem? 
GARE (O.S.) 
(through walkie-talkie) He went swimming. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS 
Hector is underwater, exploring. 
ANGLE GARE ON THE CHOPPER 
Her radar is up, she heard something.  But she doesn't see anything.  She scans the surface closely. 
EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS 
The water is slightly more visible as Hector swims.  Other than the odd school of fish, an otter, a snapping turtle... nothing extraordinary.  Then, a flash shadow looms over him.  He looks up, but sees nothing.  Probably just the sun ducking under a cloud.  It does make him sufficiently nervous, however, to head for the surface.  He swims upward. 
EXT. LAKE (SURFACE) - CONTINUOUS 
Hector breaks the top.  Lifts his mask, looks toward the chopper, which he sees about forty yards out.  He continues to breaststroke on the surface.  Suddenly... the croc's head rises up right behind Hector, who's oblivious.  He continues to swim. The croc follows.  Then... maybe divine intuition... Hector gets a feeling he's being followed.  He then turns to look the other way, upon which his face goes rigid. 
HIS P.O.V. 
About three feet from his nose... are two giant eyes staring at him. 
ANGLE HECTOR 
ashen. 
HECTOR (weakly) Oh.... my. 
The croc doesn't move.  It just stares at him.  Then end of his snout is almost touching Hector.  Hector himself doesn't dare move, for fear of spooking the croc into action.  We get the idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling any spiritual voids.  A beat. 
HECTOR (CONT'D) I suddenly feel a bit foolish. (then) You're different from the others. 
The croc raises his head now to reveal the snout.  And his deadly smile.  Hector just tries to tread water with as little motion as possible.  He deathly fears a quick movement will cause his life to be over.  Perhaps this is what he came for. To be judged by this symbol of mythology. 
He backswims ever so slightly.  The croc pursues just as slowly, their eyes are locked.  He could snap off Hector's head in an instant. 
HECTOR (CONT'D) (terrified; trying to convince himself) Holy spirit of Sobek.  Holy ghost. (swallows) Holy shit.

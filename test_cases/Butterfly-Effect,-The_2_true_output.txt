SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM - DAY - 1989 
Evan, seven, COMES TO in an old familiar place. WE are back in Mrs. Boswell's first grade class. All of the children draw colorful pictures. Evan sees some paper spindles sitting on Mrs. Boswell's desk. As he heads over to them, Mrs. Boswell firmly grabs his shoulders and steers him back to his own desk. 
MRS. BOSWELL No monkey business, Evan. Sit still and finish your drawing. 
Evan, defeated, looks over at his blank piece of paper. He smiles mischievously, and grabs some colored pencils. 
MRS. BOSWELL That's great everyone! Just imagine anything you want to be. There are no limits. 
Soon enough, an image emerges: Evan holding a knife, stands over a heap of several dead inmates Karl and Rick. 
When done, he sneaks over to Mrs. Boswell's desk, where the two paper spindles sit. The metal needles reach up and skewer a number of paper notes and messages. 
Evan looks over to see Mrs. Boswell holding up his drawing, horrified. 
EVAN (musically) Oh, Mrs. Boswelllllllll? 
She looks over in time to see Evan using all of his seven- year old strength to WHIP his hands down toward the spindles! 
The moment before his palms reach them there's a brief instant where SOUNDSCAPES COLLIDE and the world behind him VIBRATES. 
AND WE'RE BACK TO: 
INT. EVAN'S PRISON CELL - DAY - 2002 
Evan comes to as ECHOES OF SCREAMING CHILDREN FADE. Alertness slowly creeps back up on him as he hears: 
CARLOS Oh sweet Jesus. It's true. It's a miracle! A miracle! 
Evan looks up to see Carlos staring at him with reverence. 
CARLOS Your hands. The stigmata! 
Evan looks to see two scars in the center of each palm. 
EVAN What did you see? What did it look like? 
CARLOS (laughing) Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco! 
EVAN So you believe me? 
Carlos simply stares at him, awestruck, and hands over a box of cigarettes. 
INT. KARL'S CELL - CONTINUOUS 
Evan nervously approaches. A CREW of Aryans block his path. 
EVAN I want to make a deal. 
The Aryans laugh, make discrete eye contact with Karl, who grins and signals to let Evan pass. 
INT. KARL'S CELL - CONTINUOUS 
Karl and Rick wait expectantly as Evan nervously enters. They say nothing, relishing the fearful silence. 
EVAN Look. I'm new to all this but I think I get how things work. You gotta join a gang or else end up dead meat. 
They continue to stare. 
EVAN Well it sure ain't gonna fucking be with no niggers or spics. So how do we do this? You gotta work your way up, and I'm the new guy. (looking ill) So... should I... I mean, do I suck your dicks right now? 
Karl and Rick exchange looks. 
KARL Is your blood pure? 
EVAN (angry) I ain't no fucking kike if that's what you mean. 
Rick stands. All muscle. 
RICK Let's see what you got. And watch the fucking teeth or you'll be leaving without 'em. 
Evan nods reluctantly and peacefully drops to his knees. Karl and Rick lower their pants to their ankles. Evan looks miserable, about to do the deed when -- CARLOS bulldozes past the Aryans into the room, slamming Karl into the wall and jamming a shank into Karl's crotch! 
Rick instantly charges Carlos, but trips on the pants around his ankles. Evan, anticipating Rick's fall, stomps Rick's face before snatching his journals from Karl's shelf. 
Evan frantically flips through them, hunting for something, as the other WHITE SUPREMACISTS charge the cell. 
EVAN Carlos! 
Carlos drops Karl's writhing body to the floor and presses his girth against the cell door. 
Evan locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as the other supremacists force the door open -- Evan focuses on the words. Chanting quickly. 
EVAN We took the woods behind the junkyard just to make sure we wouldn't bump into Tommy. We hadn't seen the smoke yet.

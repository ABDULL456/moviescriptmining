MOVING ANGLE - THE STREET BELOW 
COPS below, COPS in the chopper, everyone rushing parallel to Eric, trying to keep up. 
ERIC'S POV - THE STREET, THE HELICOPTER 
PAN QUICK to the next ledge.  COPS right behind him on the roof as well. 
WITH ERIC - AS HE RUNS TO THE EDGE. 
and finds a void waiting there.  No connecting building. 
ANOTHER MOVING ANGLE - ERIC 
staying ahead of the search light.  A fantastic series of artful moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof. 
ANGLE - SWAT MEN ON NEXT ROOF 
sighting Eric as the light picks him out.  Eric glances at them... then jumps. 
CHOPPER PILOT (O.S./FILTERED) He's off the roof.  We can't see him. 
CLOSE-UP - LEAD SWAT 
pulling his weapon off target, because there is not target. 
LEAD SWAT Dammit to hell! (beat; to men) Come on. 
ANGLE - ALLEY - STREET LEVEL 
Eric lands like a falling safe, scattering garbage.  But he's okay, up and running. 
ANGLE - ERIC'S RUNNING POV - END OF ALLEY 
as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a stop, blocking the exit. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC 
as he backpedals, scanning for an alternate escape. 
ALBRECHT (from car) Come on! 
CLOSER ANGLE  - POLICE CAR 
We can see Albrecht.  Eric dives inside and the car burns rubber. 
INT. ALBRECHT'S CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT 
Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control. 
ALBRECHT Keep your head down! 
He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit. 
Gradually he calms down. 
ALBRECHT (CONT'D) I figured you might need a ride home. 
Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch. 
ERIC It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy. 
ERIC Funboy had to leave this mortal coil. 
ALBRECHT Yeah, among others. (sees Eric's condition) Hey, man -- you're hit. 
ERIC It's only a flesh wound. 
ALBRECHT It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds. 
Eric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff. 
ERIC You shouldn't smoke these. 
He pitches the smoke out the open car window. 
ALBRECHT Great.  Litterbug of the Living Dead. 
Eric turns back to Albrecht. 
ERIC I'm finished. 
Eric shoots him a doubtful look. 
ERIC (CONT'D) I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass... 
ALBRECHT (not buying it) Right. (beat) You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward? 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ON ALBRECHT'S CAR

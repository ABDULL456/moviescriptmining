A MAN in a Flight Attendant's uniform is standing at the window of the Apartment he shares with the Stewardess. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A cordless phone to his ear, he is looking down at the House where the dance Couple was murdered. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT The weird thing is that they closed their curtains, at first they were open like they always were and they were making love, which they always did, and then when I looked again the curtains were closed, and there were what looked like camera flashes coming from behind the curtains. 
INTERCUT with Detective Atwood. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Camera flashes? 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT That's what it looked like. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD (almost to herself) That's why he poses them. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT I'm sorry? 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Nothing. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT I wish I could be more helpful, I didn't see the killer or anything like that, but since it was weird I thought I should call. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD You've been very helpful. This answers a lot of questions for me. Thank you very much, Mr. Struber. 
She's about to hang up when Struber speaks again. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT The guy you should talk to is the guy on the floor below us... (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D) eh, I can't remember his name, but he told me once that he'd taken some great pictures of that Couple making love, he's the one you should speak to. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Would that be, Mr. Baffert? 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Yeah, I think Jim or James... 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Thank you very much. 
Atwood disconnects then quickly dials. 
DETECTIVE ATWOOD Snyder, meet me at Baffert's apartment with a Search Warrant... Listen to me, this is what you tell the judge. 
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING Ñ NIGHT 
Coming up the back STAIRS we arrive at a LANDING and make a right. In front of us is Mr. Smith watching Mr. Brooks pick the deadbolt in the Service door. 
CLICK! 
Mr. Brooks straightens up, twists the handle and pushes the door inward. It's caught by a chain. He takes the bent rubber- tipped forceps from one pocket, from another he hands Mr. Smith a pair of latex gloves. 
MR. BROOKS Put these on. 
INT. APARTMENT Ñ NIGHT 
In the middle of the large darkened KITCHEN, Mr. Brooks pauses to listen to the sounds of the Apartment. 
The gun with the silencer is already in his right hand. Both are encased in a Ziplock bag. 
Beside him, Mr. Smith is wide eyed with fear and anticipation. His teeth are even chattering. 
MR. BROOKS Try a couple deep breaths through your nose. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. SMITH I have to take a crap so bad. 
MR. BROOKS This won't take long. 
Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith come out of the Kitchen. The LIVING ROOM is quite well appointed. There's a fire going in the Fireplace. 
The sound of a T.V. is coming from a ROOM off a HALL up ahead. That is where Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith are headed. 
They're more than half way across the LIVING ROOM when DING! DONG!, the doorbell rings. 
Mr. Smith gasps and looks beseechingly at Mr. Brooks. Without an ounce of hurry, Mr. Brooks maneuvers him back into the shadows of the KITCHEN. 
The doorbell rings again. 
A wet spot appears in Mr. Smith's crotch and runs down his pant leg. Pee drips onto the linoleum. 
A Man comes out of the Hallway. The Living Room light goes on. 
The Man is Jesse, Detective Atwood's estranged husband. 
He opens the Front Door. 
The Woman who comes in is Sheila, his divorce lawyer. 
They kiss, tongues. His hands brush over her breasts. He begins to unbutton her blouse. The kiss breaks. As he continues unbuttoning. 
SHEILA I called your wife's lawyer. They're thinking about the five million dollars. 
Jesse opens the blouse and looks at the breasts under the bra. 
JESSE Realistically how much do you think we can get?

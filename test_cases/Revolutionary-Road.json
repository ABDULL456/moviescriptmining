{"test1_input": "REVOLUTIONARY ROAD \nWritten by \nJustin Haythe \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT, 1947. FLASHBACK. \nCity lights. The soaring bridges and glowing windows of New York City. The SOUNDS of a cocktail party. \nINT. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT, 1947. FLASHBACK. \nA party   of bohemian types in the village. Artist's canvases propped   up against the walls. A narrow hallway with couples talking   intimately. Two rooms crammed with young people smoking   and drinking. \nA man and a woman in their 20's stand alone in a corner... \nFRANK WHEELER, intelligent good-looks, and APRIL JOHNSON, a patrician beauty, a woman amongst girls. He's been making her laugh. \nFRANK So, what do you do? \nAPRIL I'm studying to be an actress. You? \nFRANK I'm a longshoreman. \nAPRIL (smiles) No, I mean really. \nFRANK I mean really too. Starting Monday, though, I'm doing something a little more glamorous. Night cashier at a cafeteria. \nAPRIL (smiles) I don't mean how you make money.   I mean what are you interested in? \nFRANK Honey - if I had the answer to that one, I bet I'd bore us both to death in half an hour. \nShe laughs.   He smiles, revelling in her attention. \nINT. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT, 1947, LATER. \nLater, Frank and April dance. They move well, in sync, looking into each other's eyes. He slides his hand down the silk of April's dress until it rests in the small of her back. \nClose on their hands. Their fingers slowly entwine as they lose themselves in each other... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, PRESENT. \nClose on Frank's face, seven years later, full of doubt and tension as he watches his wife, April, on stage and as we hear the hollow VOICES of a very bad amateur play... \nFinally, mercifully, the curtain falls.   Nothing.   Then vigorous, relieved applause. \nFrank hears a voice from behind, through the applause: \nWOMAN Thank God that's over... \nApril takes the final bow. She's fighting not to cry. Frank applauds her loudly. Looks around to see who else is joining him. But there is no noticeable crescendo in the applause. \nThen Frank hears the voice again: \nWOMAN (CONT'D) ...And she was very disappointing. \nHe can't argue. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER. \nFrank now moves against the crowd of exiting audience members towards the stage. He keeps his head lowered, avoiding eye- contact, until he feels a hand on his sleeve. \nMR. AND MRS. GIVINGS, an older couple, are standing in his way. \nMRS. GIVINGS Frank! Very nice Frank! \nFRANK Thanks, Mrs. Givings. \n", "test1_true": "MRS. GIVINGS I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it. You have a very talented wife. \nFrank forces a smile as he goes. \nFRANK I'll pass it along! \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT. \nApril sits alone at her dressing table crying. \nINT. BACK STAGE - NIGHT. \nThe CAST mills backstage. The mood is subdued, but some have decided to make light of the disaster. \nFrank moves through the crowd.    Across the room, he sees - \nMILLY CAMPBELL, 30's, determinedly bright, up on her tip- toes. Her husband SHEP, 30's, heavy-set, is still in costume, shell-shocked and pebbled with sweat. \nMILLY Frank! \nFRANK Hi! \nMILLY She's through there...! (points) You `bout ready for that drink? \nFRANK Couple of minutes! \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT. \nFrank enters. The chair in front of the mirror is empty. A cigarette burns in the ashtray. Frank glances at a standing screen in the corner. April's costume is draped over the top. He goes towards it, deciding what to say. \nFRANK (heartfelt) April, sweetheart.   You were great. I mean it. \nThe door to the bathroom opens. April enters in street clothes. Frank's been talking to an empty room. \nAPRIL Hi. You about ready to leave? I've just got to get this makeup off, then we can go. \nShe sits in front of the mirror, too embarrassed to look at him. FRANK can see that her face is blotchy from crying. He puts his hand on her shoulder. \nFRANK Well... I guess it wasn't a triumph or anything, was it? \nAPRIL looks at him in the mirror. She holds his look just a second. And from her expression, he knows he said exactly the wrong thing. \nAPRIL I guess not. I'll be ready in a minute. \nFRANK Take your time. \nHe removes his hands and lights a cigarette.     APRIL begins to take off her makeup. \nAPRIL Will you do me a favor? Milly and Shep wanted us to go out with them afterwards. Will you say we can't? Say it's because of the baby sitter or something? \nFRANK Well, the thing is, I already said that we could. I mean, I just saw them out there and I said we would. \nAPRIL (tense) Oh. Then would you mind going out again and saying you were mistaken? That should be simple enough. \nFRANK Don't you think that's a little bit rude, April? \nAPRIL Well I'll tell them myself. \nFRANK Okay. Okay. Take it easy. I'll tell them. \nHe backs to the door. \nINT. HIGH-SCHOOL CORRIDOR - NIGHT. \nApril and Frank walk down a long empty echoing corridor, past school lockers, booster club posters and silent classrooms. \nThey don't touch.   They don't speak.   The tension between them is palpable. \n", "test1_id": 1830, "test2_input": "April is sitting with the box at the kitchen table. It contains various sentimental knickknacks from her past, including photos of the kids, of her and Frank in New York with friends, and a photograph of Frank in uniform beneath the Eifel tower on liberation day... She studies it. \nINT. BETHUNE STREET APARTMENT - DAWN, 1947. FLASHBACK \nFrank fixes coffee in the tiny kitchen. \nApril is sitting up in bed in the first blue light of day wearing Frank's T-shirt. She holds a curled collection of black and white photographs in her lap. She stops on the same picture of Frank and the Eifel Tower. \nFrank comes over with the coffee, and two cigarettes.     He lights them both, and gives her one. \nFRANK You ever been to Paris? \nAPRIL I've never really been anywhere. \nFRANK Maybe I'll take you with me. \nHe lies down with his cigarette between his teeth. \nFRANK (CONT'D) I'm going back first chance I get. People are alive there. \nHe stares up at the ceiling.    She studies him.   Appraising. \nFRANK (CONT'D) All I know now is that I want to feel things. Really feel them. How's that for an ambition...? \nAPRIL Frank Wheeler? \nFRANK Mm? \nAPRIL I think you're the most interesting person I've ever met. \nHe looks at her, overwhelmed by her face in the light. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) I mean it. \nINT. MAUREEN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON \nFrank stands at the mantle tying his tie. \nFRANK Well, I guess this wasn't what you had in mind when you went to work this morning? \nMaureen covers herself with the sheets. \nMAUREEN No.   It certainly wasn't. \nFrank inspects the contents of the mantle: photos of Maureen at the prom; Maureen with her parents. \nMaureen tentatively fingers her hair that has now gone to frizz. The sheet slips down. She grabs at it. Then wills herself to calm down and act sophisticated. \nMAUREEN (CONT'D) Do you have a cigarette, Frank? \nHe turns and smiles at her. \nFRANK Sure, here. \nHe comes over and gives her one. Lights it with his Zippo. She exhales, slowly gaining confidence. \nFrank gets up and pulls on his jacket. \nMAUREEN Can I get you a drink or anything? \nFRANK No thanks, Maureen. Actually, I guess I'd better be cutting out, it's getting kind of late. \nMAUREEN Gee, that's right.   Have you missed your train? \nFRANK It's all right, I'll get the next one. \nHe comes over to her.   Bends down, kisses her gently on the lips. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Listen: you were swell. Take care now. \n", "test2_true": "Frank's station car turns into the driveway.     He sits there a moment in the darkness. \nEXT. WHEELER FRONT DOOR - NIGHT. \nFrank approaches the door with his key. He takes a moment to gather himself, but before he can, the door opens. \nApril is dressed in a black cocktail dress. She looks wonderful. She smiles. She steps forward and takes his face in her hands. She kisses him. \nAPRIL Frank... \nFRANK Why are you all dressed up? \nShe hands him a glass of whiskey and closes his fingers around it. \nAPRIL First of all, I missed you all day and I want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the way I've been since that stupid play. I'm sorry for everything and... And I love you... Now wait here till I call you. Okay? \nShe goes, leaving Frank in stunned silence.    He takes a large drink. \nFrom inside the house, the sound of the children's voices. Whispering, giggling. Then April's voice: \nAPRIL (O.S.) (CONT'D) Alright Frank! You can come in now! \nINT. WHEELER LIVING AND DINING ROOMS - NIGHT. \nFrank enters the house.    Walks through the darkened living room towards the light.    Enters the dining room. \nThe room is lit by the candles burning on a birthday cake. \nJENNIFER, 7, MICHAEL, 5, and April sit around the table wearing paper birthday crowns. \nThey sing Happy Birthday. \nINT. SHOWER - NIGHT. \nFrank scrubs his skin, his scalp, his face: trying to wash away Maureen. \nHe turns off the water.   He stands there in the silence, regaining control. \nINT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. \nFrank steps out of the bathroom. April turns from the mirror wearing the silk negligee and comes towards him with two glasses. \nAPRIL Frank. I have had the most wonderful idea. I've been thinking about it all day. \nFRANK What's all this about? \nAPRIL You know how much money we have saved...? \nShe hands Frank a glass of brandy. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) Enough to live on for six months without you earning another dime. And with the money we could get from the house and the car, longer than that. \nFRANK What we get for the house...What are you talking about? Where are we going to live? \nAPRIL ...Paris. \nFrank stares. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) You always said it was the only place you'd ever been that was worth living. So why don't we go there? \nFRANK You're serious? \nAPRIL Yes.   What's stopping us? \nFRANK What's stopping us? Well, I can think of a lot of things. For instance, what kind of a job could I possibly get? \nAPRIL You won't be getting any kind of job, because I will. \n", "test2_id": 1831, "test3_input": "April suddenly stands up.    Frank and Shep watch her walk down to the water's edge. \nSHEP She okay? \nFrank stares after her. \nEXT. LONG ISLAND SOUND BEACH, WATER'S EDGE - AFTERNOON. \nApril stands in the water staring out over the sea. The waves break against her ankles. Whether it occurs to her or not, she's staring in the direction of Europe. \nFrank comes up beside her. \nAPRIL I thought you turned the job down? \nFRANK (shrugs) Not yet... It's just an option, that's all. With the money they're talking, things could be different for us here. We could get a better place. Travel. \nApril shakes her head and drags on her cigarette. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Look, the point is - we could be happy here. At least for a while. \nShe stares out at the sea. \nFRANK (CONT'D) It is possible that Parisians aren't the only ones who know how to lead interesting lives, April. \nShe turns to him. \nAPRIL So you've made up your mind? \nFRANK No.   Like I said, it's an option. \nAPRIL ...And supposing you're right. You make all this money and we have this interesting life here. Won't you still be wasting your life toiling away at a job you find ridiculous? Just like your father. \nFRANK (sharp) Maybe we let that be my business. \nAPRIL (incredulous) Your business? \nFRANK (exhales) It's too hot for this.    I'm going to get wet. \nShe just looks at him. He walks into the ocean.   She stands on the shore, watching him swim away from her. \nINT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT. \nApril paces the family room. Her hair is a defiant mess. She still wears her bathing suit under her clothes. \nFrank sits on the couch. \nThe windows are open, and most of the lights are off. It's a very hot night. \nAPRIL You don't want to go, do you? \nFRANK Come on, April.   Of course I do. \nAPRIL You don't! Because you've never tried at anything. And if you don't try at anything you can't fail. \nFRANK What the hell do you    mean I don't try? I support you,     don't I? I pay for this house.     I work ten hours a day at a job    I can't stand. \nAPRIL You don't have to! \nFRANK Bullshit! I'm not happy about it. But I have the backbone not to run away from my responsibilities! \nAPRIL It takes backbone to lead the life you want, Frank. \nHe shakes his head and gets up. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) Where are you going? \nFRANK Is it alright with you if I go to the bathroom? \nShe disgustedly twists out her cigarette, and immediately lights another. \n", "test3_true": "Frank splashes water on his face like a boxer between rounds. He looks up at his reflection. \nHe reaches for a towel, but there isn't one. He turns to the shelf behind him and pulls down a fresh towel. Something catches his eye. \nHe reaches to the back and retrieves a small brown paper package. \nHe opens it, his face slowly registering what it means... \nINT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT. \nApril wheels around as - \nFrank storms in, a rubber syringe in his hand. \nFRANK What the hell are you going to do with this? \nAPRIL And what do you think you're going to do? You're going to stop me? \nFRANK You're damn right! \nAPRIL Go ahead and try! \nHe comes at her across the room with the syringe in his hand. She moves away. \nFRANK Listen. Listen to me. You do this - you do this and I swear to God I'll - \nAPRIL You'll what? You'll leave me?   Is that a threat, or a promise? \nHe shakes it in her face. \nFRANK When did you buy this, April?   I want to know! \nAPRIL You know you really are being melodramatic about the whole thing. As long as it's done in the first twelve weeks, it's perfectly safe. \nFRANK That's now April!   Don't I get a say? \nAPRIL Of course you do! It would be for you, Frank, don't you see? So you can have time. Like we talked about. \nFRANK How can it be for me if the thought makes my stomach turn over? \nAPRIL Then it's for me... Tell me we can have the baby in Paris, Frank. But don't make me stay here. Please. \nFRANK We can't have the baby in Paris. \nAPRIL Why not? I don't need everything we have here. I don't care where we live! I mean who made these rules, anyway? The only reason we moved out here was because I got pregnant. Then we had another child to prove the first one wasn't a mistake. I mean how long does it go on? \nHe turns away. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) Frank. Do you actually want another child? Well, do you? \nHe won't answer. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) Come on, tell me. Tell me the truth, Frank. Remember that? We used to live by it. You know what's so good about the truth? Everyone knows what it is, however long they've lived without it. No one forgets the truth, Frank, they just get better at lying. So tell me: do you really want another child? \nFrank turns towards her. \nFRANK All I know is what I feel. And anyone else in their right mind would feel the same way. \nAPRIL (quiet) But I've had two children.    Doesn't that count in my favor? \nFRANK Christ! The fact that you even put it that way! You make it sound like having children is a punishment. \nAPRIL I love my children. \nFRANK And you're sure about that? \nAPRIL What the hell is that supposed to mean? \n", "test3_id": 1832}

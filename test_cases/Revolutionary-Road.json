{"train": "REVOLUTIONARY ROAD \nWritten by \nJustin Haythe \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT, 1947. FLASHBACK. \nCity lights. The soaring bridges and glowing windows of New York City. The SOUNDS of a cocktail party. \nINT. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT, 1947. FLASHBACK. \nA party   of bohemian types in the village. Artist's canvases propped   up against the walls. A narrow hallway with couples talking   intimately. Two rooms crammed with young people smoking   and drinking. \nA man and a woman in their 20's stand alone in a corner... \nFRANK WHEELER, intelligent good-looks, and APRIL JOHNSON, a patrician beauty, a woman amongst girls. He's been making her laugh. \nFRANK So, what do you do? \nAPRIL I'm studying to be an actress. You? \nFRANK I'm a longshoreman. \nAPRIL (smiles) No, I mean really. \nFRANK I mean really too. Starting Monday, though, I'm doing something a little more glamorous. Night cashier at a cafeteria. \nAPRIL (smiles) I don't mean how you make money.   I mean what are you interested in? \nFRANK Honey - if I had the answer to that one, I bet I'd bore us both to death in half an hour. \nShe laughs.   He smiles, revelling in her attention. \nINT. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT, 1947, LATER. \nLater, Frank and April dance. They move well, in sync, looking into each other's eyes. He slides his hand down the silk of April's dress until it rests in the small of her back. \nClose on their hands. Their fingers slowly entwine as they lose themselves in each other... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, PRESENT. \nClose on Frank's face, seven years later, full of doubt and tension as he watches his wife, April, on stage and as we hear the hollow VOICES of a very bad amateur play... \nFinally, mercifully, the curtain falls.   Nothing.   Then vigorous, relieved applause. \nFrank hears a voice from behind, through the applause: \nWOMAN Thank God that's over... \nApril takes the final bow. She's fighting not to cry. Frank applauds her loudly. Looks around to see who else is joining him. But there is no noticeable crescendo in the applause. \nThen Frank hears the voice again: \nWOMAN (CONT'D) ...And she was very disappointing. \nHe can't argue. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER. \nFrank now moves against the crowd of exiting audience members towards the stage. He keeps his head lowered, avoiding eye- contact, until he feels a hand on his sleeve. \nMR. AND MRS. GIVINGS, an older couple, are standing in his way. \nMRS. GIVINGS Frank! Very nice Frank! \nFRANK Thanks, Mrs. Givings. \nINT. WHEELER CAR - NIGHT. \nFrank drives. April stares ahead.    Their faces are lit by the dashboard. After a while... \nFRANK I mean it, baby. You were the only person in that play. \nAPRIL Thank you. \nHe looks over at her. \nFRANK We just never should've let you get mixed up in the damned thing. \nAPRIL All right. \nFRANK You've studied for Christ's sake. \nAPRIL Could we sort of stop talking about it now? \nFRANK Sure. I just don't want you feeling bad about it, that's all. Because it's not worth it. I mean, it's bad enough having to live out here among these damn people - what'd you say? \nAPRIL I said yes. All right, Frank. Could you just stop talking now, before you drive me crazy, please? \nFrank clenches his jaw and flips on the indicator. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) What are you doing? Why are we stopping? \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT. \nThe car comes to a stop at the side of the road. \nINT. WHEELER CAR - NIGHT. \nFrank turns off the ignition.   He slides towards her. \nAPRIL No, Frank, please don't... \nHe puts his arms around her. \nFRANK Baby, it's okay... \nAPRIL Please don't touch me. \nFRANK April... \nAPRIL Why can't you...just... LEAVE ME ALONE! \nFrank slides back behind the wheel.    Beat. \nFRANK It strikes me, that there's a considerable amount of bullshit going on here.... And there's one or two things I'd like to clear up. Number one, it's not my fault the play was lousy. Number two, it's sure as hell not my fault you didn't turn out to be an actress, and the sooner you get over that little piece of soap opera the better off we'll both be. Number three, I don't happen to fit the role of dumb, insensitive suburban husband; you've been trying to hang that one on me ever since we moved here. Number four - \nShe opens the door and is out of the car, flashing across the headlights. Frank struggles with his door. \nEXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER - NIGHT. \nApril stands in the dark 30 yards from the road looking over an expansive countryside. There's only a few lights in the distance. This is still farmland. \nFrank comes up behind her, careful to keep his distance. \nFRANK What the hell are you doing?     Come back to the car. \nAPRIL No. Just let me stand here a second. \nFrank raises his arms in exasperation. A car approaches.    He puts a hand in his pocket and tries to look casual. The car's headlights light up April's back, then pass. \nFRANK April? \nShe doesn't move. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Look, can't we sit in the car and talk about it, instead of running all over Route Twelve? \nINT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - MORNING. \nAn empty stairwell in Grand Central: a tide of grim, determined commuters rise into view. A mass of suits and hats. Frank is amongst them. \nEXT. MIDTOWN STREET - MORNING. \nKnox Headquarters -- a squat, formidable structure.   Thick HONKING traffic. Crowded sidewalks. \nFrank walks with the crowd past a display window: bright cardboard images of fashionable women grin and point their pencils at a list of product benefits - \"SPEED, ACCURACY, CONTROL.\" \nPride of place at the center of the display is a new Knox 500 Electronic Computer with a sign that reads: \"Performs A Man's Lifetime of Work in Just 30 Minutes!\" \nINT. KNOX BUILDING ELEVATOR - MORNING. \nFrank rides crushed against the wall in a crowded elevator. He glances over at - \nMAUREEN GRUBE, 23, ripe, a little obvious, but undeniably sexy.   She meets his look. And looks away. \nINT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, FRANK'S CUBICLE - MORNING. \nFrank opens the bottom right drawer of his desk, props up his feet and lights a cigarette. \nJACK (O.S.) I'm going to need your help this morning, Old Scout. \nSeated beside Frank, JACK ORDWAY, 40's, tall and effete with greying hair, appears to be hard at work, hunched over a file. He is, in fact, propping up his head with his hand while shielding his eyes. \nJACK (CONT'D) For the next few hours, you're to warn me of Bandy's every approach and you may have to screen me from public view in the likely event I that I throw up. It's that bad. \nFRANK Good morning, Jack. \nJACK Nothing good about it, I assure you. \nEXT. WHEELER HOUSE - DAY. \nApril drags two overflowing garbage cans to the curb. She stops and looks down the empty road. Not a single human being in sight. \nClose on April's face. \nINT. MRS. GIVINGS' CAR - DAY, 1948. FLASHBACK. \nMrs. Givings sits behind the wheel, driving slowly along a suburban street talking at high speed. \nFrank sits beside her wearing sunglasses.    April sits in the back. \nWe don't yet see what Mrs. Givings is describing, only as it plays on their faces. \nMRS. GIVINGS Of course, I knew the moment you came off the train what you were looking for... A small remodeled barn, or a carriage house \u00ad And I just hate to be the one to tell you that sort of thing just isn't available anymore... But I don't want you to despair. There is one place down here I want to show you... Now of course it isn't very desirable at this end. (gestures) As you see, Crawford Road is mostly these little cinder-blocky, pick-up trucky places \u00ad plumbers, carpenters, little local people of that sort. \nFrank turns around to April, lowers his glasses. April stifles a giggle. \nMRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) But eventually... (she points, her arm fully extended) Eventually it leads up to Revolutionary Road, which is much nicer. Now, the place I want to show you, is a sweet little house and a sweet little setting. Simple, clean lines, good lawns, marvelous for children. It's right around this next curve... Now, you'll see it \u00ad there. \nThey all look. \nMRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) See the little white one? Sweet isn't it? The perky way it sits there on its little slope? Charming, isn't it? \nApril smiles.    A smile full of promise. \nAPRIL Oh, yes. \nINT. BANDY'S OFFICE - DAY. PRESENT. \nFrank's FIST raps against the door of an office... \nTED BANDY, 46, tight and precise, looks up from behind a well- organized desk. \nFRANK You wanted to see me? \nBandy holds out an envelope from behind his desk. \nThe waiter brings over the phone. Frank dials. He holds his finger to his lips. He uses an authoritative tone. \nFRANK Hello Mrs. Jorgensen. Frank Wheeler here. Just wanted to let you know that I've had to send Maureen Grube down to Visual Aides for me. I'll probably need her the rest of the day... Okay? Fine. You too. \nFrank hangs up and smiles at Maureen. \nMAUREEN I never even heard of Visual Aides. \nFRANK That's because it doesn't exist. \nMaureen smiles. \nINT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY. \nNow we're moving behind April as she moves through the silent house. She carries a basket of dirty laundry on her hip. She pulls the bedding off the couch. The distant SOUND of children playing. \nMRS. GIVINGS (O.S.) Yoo-hoo! \nShe turns to see Mrs. Givings at the screen door. \nApril manages a friendly smile. \nAPRIL Hi Helen. \nMRS. GIVINGS I can't stay a minute... My, don't you look comfy! I just wanted to bring this sedum for that messy patch in the front yard. \nShe puts it on the table. \nMRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) All it wants is just a tiny dollop of water for the first few days, and you'll find it absolutely thrives. \nAPRIL Well, thank you... You want some coffee? \nMRS. GIVINGS Only if you're having some. \nHelen sits down. With the end of her finger, she pushes a dirty dish out of her way. \nAPRIL Is there something I can do for you, Helen? \nMRS. GIVINGS Oh... yes, I almost forgot. I do have a small favor I'd like to ask... (quiver of anxiety ) It's about my son, John. He's been in the hospital. \nAPRIL I'm sorry to hear that. \nMRS. GIVINGS Well, actually, just for the present, he's in Pleasant Brook... Psychiatric. \nApril's face.   She knows what it means. \nAPRIL ...I'm so sorry. \nMRS. GIVINGS Oh... Nothing serious. He just got a little run down. Things can just get the better of us sometimes. Don't you think? \nAPRIL Yes.    Of course. \nMrs. Givings smiles. Then, pretending to read the titles on a stack of books on the table... \nMRS. GIVINGS It really is a marvellous facility and the treatments seem to be doing him wonders... Anyway, they said getting out for an afternoon might do him some good. \nShe pauses on Sartre's `Nausea', looks at it vaguely. \nMRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) I think he finds my friends a little conventional, frankly. I mean, he's travelled. He has a PhD in mathematics. I suppose you could say he's an intellectual. It would do him a world of good to meet a young couple like you. \nAPRIL We'd love to Helen. \nMRS. GIVINGS So, I thought perhaps if you had some time... \nAPRIL We'd love to. \nMRS. GIVINGS (flushed with relief) Thank you, dear... Thank you. \nApril smiles generously. \nApril is sitting with the box at the kitchen table. It contains various sentimental knickknacks from her past, including photos of the kids, of her and Frank in New York with friends, and a photograph of Frank in uniform beneath the Eifel tower on liberation day... She studies it. \nINT. BETHUNE STREET APARTMENT - DAWN, 1947. FLASHBACK \nFrank fixes coffee in the tiny kitchen. \nApril is sitting up in bed in the first blue light of day wearing Frank's T-shirt. She holds a curled collection of black and white photographs in her lap. She stops on the same picture of Frank and the Eifel Tower. \nFrank comes over with the coffee, and two cigarettes.     He lights them both, and gives her one. \nFRANK You ever been to Paris? \nAPRIL I've never really been anywhere. \nFRANK Maybe I'll take you with me. \nHe lies down with his cigarette between his teeth. \nFRANK (CONT'D) I'm going back first chance I get. People are alive there. \nHe stares up at the ceiling.    She studies him.   Appraising. \nFRANK (CONT'D) All I know now is that I want to feel things. Really feel them. How's that for an ambition...? \nAPRIL Frank Wheeler? \nFRANK Mm? \nAPRIL I think you're the most interesting person I've ever met. \nHe looks at her, overwhelmed by her face in the light. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) I mean it. \nINT. MAUREEN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON \nFrank stands at the mantle tying his tie. \nFRANK Well, I guess this wasn't what you had in mind when you went to work this morning? \nMaureen covers herself with the sheets. \nMAUREEN No.   It certainly wasn't. \nFrank inspects the contents of the mantle: photos of Maureen at the prom; Maureen with her parents. \nMaureen tentatively fingers her hair that has now gone to frizz. The sheet slips down. She grabs at it. Then wills herself to calm down and act sophisticated. \nMAUREEN (CONT'D) Do you have a cigarette, Frank? \nHe turns and smiles at her. \nFRANK Sure, here. \nHe comes over and gives her one. Lights it with his Zippo. She exhales, slowly gaining confidence. \nFrank gets up and pulls on his jacket. \nMAUREEN Can I get you a drink or anything? \nFRANK No thanks, Maureen. Actually, I guess I'd better be cutting out, it's getting kind of late. \nMAUREEN Gee, that's right.   Have you missed your train? \nFRANK It's all right, I'll get the next one. \nHe comes over to her.   Bends down, kisses her gently on the lips. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Listen: you were swell. Take care now. \nFrank laughs. \nFRANK Oh, right. \nAPRIL Don't laugh -- listen a minute! Have you any idea what they pay for secretarial positions in the government agencies in Europe? Embassies and those things. \nFrank laughs again. \nFRANK No, I don't. \nAPRIL I'm serious about this Frank. Do you think I'm kidding or something? \nFRANK No, I know, I know. I just have a couple of questions, is all. For one thing, do you mind telling me what exactly I'm supposed to be doing while you're out earning all this money? \nShe draws back, shocked that he doesn't get it. \nAPRIL Don't you see that's the whole idea? You'll be doing what you should've been allowed to do seven years ago. You'll have time, Frank. You'll have time to find out what it is that you actually want to do, and when you figure it out you'll have the time and the freedom to start doing it. \nFRANK Sweetheart, it's just not very realistic, is all. \nAPRIL Well, I happen to think this is unrealistic. I think it's unrealistic for a man with a fine mind to go on working like a dog year after year at a job he can't stand, coming home to a place he can't stand, to a wife who's equally unable to stand the same things. \nFrank is silent.   How could anyone possibly argue with her? \nAPRIL (CONT'D) You want to know the worst part? Our whole existence here is based on this great premise that we're somehow very special and superior to the whole thing, and you know what I've realized...? We're not! We're just like everyone else. Look at us!   We've bought into the same ridiculous delusion. This idea that you have to resign from life and settle down the moment you have children. And we've been punishing each other for it. \nFRANK Listen: we decided to move out here. No one ever forced me to take the job at Knox. (MORE) \nFRANK (CONT'D) I mean who ever said I was supposed to be a big deal, anyway? \nAPRIL When I first met you, there was nothing in the world you couldn't do or be. \nFRANK I was a little wise guy with a big mouth, that's all. \nAPRIL You were not! How can you even say that? \nFRANK ...All right... So, I'll have time. And God knows that's appealing. It's very appealing. And I mean, everything you say might make a certain amount of sense, if I had some definite talent maybe. If I were an artist or a writer. \nAPRIL But Frank, listen to me: It's what you are that's being stifled here. It's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life. \nFRANK And what's that? \nAPRIL Don't you know...? \nHe looks at her.   She gazes back at him. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) You're the most valuable and wonderful thing in the world... You're a man. \nFrank looks at her. In that moment, he loves her more than ever before. He kisses her. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) This is our chance, Frank.   This is our one chance. \nBeat. \nFRANK Okay. \nAPRIL Okay? \nFRANK Why not...? Why the hell not? \nApril throws her arms around him. \nINT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, ELEVATOR BAY - MORNING. \nDING. The elevator doors slide open.   Frank steps onto the fifteenth floor, full of energy. \nINT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, FRANK'S CUBICLE - MORNING. \nFrank arrives at his desk.   Casually tosses his briefcase down. Lights a cigarette. \nFRANK (CONT'D) This one's on me. \nEXT GRAND CENTRAL STATION - AFTERNOON \nFrank is standing leaning against a coffee bar in Grand Central Station. He is finishing a beer. \nIt is rush hour, and amidst the sea of people, he is the only one not moving. \nHe is watching all the people walking by with an air of detached amusement. As if he were now above them all. \nEXT. SPACE BETWEEN TRAIN CARS - AFTERNOON. \nFrank rides between train cars. The wind whips his hair. He takes a deep pull from a pinched cigarette - then flicks it straight as a bullet into the passing countryside. \nHe feels alive. \nEXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD TRAIN STATION - AFTERNOON. \nThe commuter train slows into the station. A door swings open. And Frank leaps from the still moving train onto the platform. He slows to a walk. \nEXT. WHEELER HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON. \nThe kids dance back and forth through the sprinkler, shrieking with pleasure. \nApril sits on the steps in front of the house reading some material from the American Express office. \nShe looks up as Frank's car pulls into the drive. He steps out of the car and comes towards her. She looks up and smiles. He drops his brief case on the ground and walks towards her. She meets him in the middle of the lawn, and they embrace. \nINT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - EVENING. \nCLOSE UP - two fingers walk the journey from New York to Paris across the page of an atlas. \nMichael and Jennifer, dressed for bed, sit sandwiched between April and Frank under the bedclothes. \nAPRIL ...All the way to... here. \nA pause as the two kids stare at the Atlas. \nJENNIFER But why? \nAPRIL Well, sweetheart. It's a big world out there and we thought maybe we should go see a little bit of it. \nMICHAEL How far is it? \nAPRIL A long way. We have to take a boat ride over the sea to get there. \nJENNIFER I won't know anyone there. \nAPRIL I know. And neither will I. But remember when you started school? And now look how many friends you have... \nFrank senses that they are a little concerned.   April and Frank look to one another. \nFRANK You'll never guess what they eat in Paris. You'll never guess... \nJENNIFER What? \nFRANK Snails. \nJENNIFER/MICHAEL Snails?! \nAPRIL And frog's legs! \nThe children dissolve into disgusted laughter.    April and Frank laugh with them. \nINT. CAMPBELL FRONT HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON. \nAt the bottom of the stairs, Shep hums a big band number as he vigorously shines his shoes. \nSHEP Buddappa banh!     Banh!   Banh! \nJOHN (CONT'D) (suddenly serious) But, hey... Listen, though. You got a high-ball glass...? Put a couple-three ice cubes in it, pour it up to the brim. That's the way I like it. \nFRANK I think I can do that. \nMr. Givings eats his sandwich, watching his son. \nMRS. GIVINGS Oh, this is the most wonderful egg salad, April. You must tell me how you fix it. \nFrank hands John his high-ball glass. \nJOHN You a lawyer Frank? \nFRANK No, I'm not. \nJOHN I could use a lawyer. \nMR. GIVINGS John, let's not get started again about the lawyer. \nJOHN Pop, couldn't you just sit there and eat your wonderful egg salad, and quit horning in? \nMr. Givings gives his son a level, warning look. \nJOHN (CONT'D) See, I've got a good many questions to ask and I'm willing to pay for the answers... Now, I don't need to be told that a man who goes after his mother with a coffee table is putting himself in a weak position legally; that's obvious. \nFrank and April exchange a look. \nMRS. GIVINGS John, come and have a look out this fabulous picture window. \nMrs. Givings gets up and goes to the window. \nJOHN If he hits her with it and kills her, that's a criminal case. \nMRS. GIVINGS Oh, look, the sun's coming out! \nJOHN If all he does is break the coffee table and give her a certain amount of aggravation and she decides to go to court over it, that's a civil case. \nMRS. GIVINGS Maybe we'll see a rainbow!   John, come have a look. \nJOHN Ma, how about doing everybody a favor? How about shutting up! \nApril's face.   She's not smiling now. \nMR. GIVINGS Steady down, now. \nWith her back to the room, Mrs. Givings closes her eyes. \nFRANK I can look into it.   Maybe recommend someone. \nJohn stares at Frank for any sign of condescension. \nJOHN So, what do you do, Frank? \nFRANK I work for Knox Business Machines. \nJOHN You design the machines? \nFRANK Nope. \nJOHN Make `em, sell `em, repair `em? \nMRS. GIVINGS All these questions. \nFRANK I sort of help sell them, I guess. I work in the office. Actually, it's sort of a stupid job. I mean there's nothing \u00ad you know, interesting about it or anything. \nMRS. GIVINGS Oh, Frank... \nJOHN Whaddya do it for then? \nMR. GIVINGS Maybe Frank doesn't want to be questioned like this, son. \nJohn stares at April.    He smiles. \nJOHN I like your girl, Frank. \nFRANK Me too. \nJOHN So, what do a couple of people like you have to run away from? \nFRANK We're not running. \nJohn comes to a stop. \nJOHN And what's in Paris? \nAPRIL A different way of life. \nFRANK So maybe we are running... We're running from the hopeless emptiness of the whole life here. \nJOHN The hopeless emptiness? Now, you've said it. Plenty of people are on to the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness... Wow. \nJohn continues walking.   Frank and April watch him go. \nINT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DUSK. \nFrank and April at the kitchen table. \nAPRIL You know, he's the first person who seemed to know what we were talking about. \nFRANK That's true. Maybe we are just as crazy as he is. \nAPRIL If being crazy means living life as if it matters then I don't care if we are completely insane. (beat) Do you? \nFRANK No. \nAPRIL I love you so much. \nEXT. WHEELER HOUSE - DAY \nThe small, attractive house bathed in sunlight. \nINT. MIDTOWN HOTEL RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON. \nFrank follows Bart Pollock as he cuts a swathe through an impressive midtown eatery. A small MAITRE D' scuttles in front of them. Bart nods, points at well-wishers, and makes a politician's show of knowing the staff. \nBART POLLOCK Tell you something, Frank. I'm a little sore at Bandy for the way he's kept you under a bushel all these years. This place okay, for you? \nFrank smirks at the performance. \nFRANK This is just fine, sir.   Fine. \nINT. MIDTOWN HOTEL RESTAURANT - LATER. \nBart Pollock sits across an expanse of white tablecloth gripping a martini glass in one of his enormous paws. \nBART POLLOCK One thing interests me, Frank, and one thing only: selling the electronic computer to the American businessman... \nBART POLLOCK (CONT'D) That's why I'm assembling a team. Men like you, not your average salesmen... It'll mean more money, and I got to be honest, maybe more of a time commitment. But you'll be part of something exciting, Wheeler... Computers. \nFRANK Well, sir, it sounds exciting. \nBART POLLOCK Bart! \nFRANK Bart... \nFrank looks down at his plate.   He can't help himself. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Do you happen to remember an Earl Wheeler? \nBart looks at him blankly. \nMAUREEN (CONT'D) maybe I should buy you a drink or something? You know...? Celebrate. \nFrank's face.   We don't know which way he'll go.   He smiles. \nFRANK Yeah.   Maybe. \nShe smiles.   She can't quite believe it. \nMAUREEN I'll just get my coat. \nFrank sits there a moment longer, thinking.    Then he follows. \nINT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - DAY. \nOn a television. Elmer Fudd points a gun at Bugs Bunny, and pulls the trigger. \nFrank frowns into his French phrase book.   Mike is watching the TV. \nApril works a sewing machine with a cigarette burning beside her. Jennifer stands beside her holding a stuffed Giraffe and a list, which she reads. \nJENNIFER I'm going to take my doll carriage and my bear and my three Easter rabbits and my giraffe and all my dolls and my doll house. \nAPRIL I thought maybe we'd give the doll house to Madeline. \nJENNIFER No! I don't want to give it to Madeline. \nApril has to stop to re-thread and she's losing patience. \nAPRIL I already explained to you, the big things are going to be hard to pack. \nFrank lowers the book.   He recognizes her tone. \nJENNIFER But Madeline can have my bear and my Easter rabbits - \nAPRIL No! Just the big things. Look. Wouldn't you rather go outside and play with Michael. \nJENNIFER I don't feel like it. \nAPRIL You've been inside all day. \nJENNIFER I don't feel like it! \nAPRIL Well, I don't feel like explaining everything fifteen times to somebody who's too bored and silly to listen! \nJennifer turns and runs up the stairs, upset. \nApril lets out a defeated sigh. She turns to the kitchen to see to the supper. Steam rises from the vegetables. \nFrank stands in the entrance silently watching for a moment. \nFRANK What's the matter? \nAPRIL Nothing. \nShe carries a pot of steaming, overcooked vegetables to the sink, slops them into a colander. \nFRANK I don't believe you. Did something happen today or what? \nAPRIL Nothing happened today that I haven't known about for days and days. \nFRANK What? \nAPRIL Oh God, Frank, please don't look so dense. Do you mean you haven't guessed or anything? \nFRANK What are you talking about? \nShe finally stops and looks at him. \nAPRIL I'm pregnant, that's all. \nApril suddenly stands up.    Frank and Shep watch her walk down to the water's edge. \nSHEP She okay? \nFrank stares after her. \nEXT. LONG ISLAND SOUND BEACH, WATER'S EDGE - AFTERNOON. \nApril stands in the water staring out over the sea. The waves break against her ankles. Whether it occurs to her or not, she's staring in the direction of Europe. \nFrank comes up beside her. \nAPRIL I thought you turned the job down? \nFRANK (shrugs) Not yet... It's just an option, that's all. With the money they're talking, things could be different for us here. We could get a better place. Travel. \nApril shakes her head and drags on her cigarette. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Look, the point is - we could be happy here. At least for a while. \nShe stares out at the sea. \nFRANK (CONT'D) It is possible that Parisians aren't the only ones who know how to lead interesting lives, April. \nShe turns to him. \nAPRIL So you've made up your mind? \nFRANK No.   Like I said, it's an option. \nAPRIL ...And supposing you're right. You make all this money and we have this interesting life here. Won't you still be wasting your life toiling away at a job you find ridiculous? Just like your father. \nFRANK (sharp) Maybe we let that be my business. \nAPRIL (incredulous) Your business? \nFRANK (exhales) It's too hot for this.    I'm going to get wet. \nShe just looks at him. He walks into the ocean.   She stands on the shore, watching him swim away from her. \nINT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT. \nApril paces the family room. Her hair is a defiant mess. She still wears her bathing suit under her clothes. \nFrank sits on the couch. \nThe windows are open, and most of the lights are off. It's a very hot night. \nAPRIL You don't want to go, do you? \nFRANK Come on, April.   Of course I do. \nAPRIL You don't! Because you've never tried at anything. And if you don't try at anything you can't fail. \nFRANK What the hell do you    mean I don't try? I support you,     don't I? I pay for this house.     I work ten hours a day at a job    I can't stand. \nAPRIL You don't have to! \nFRANK Bullshit! I'm not happy about it. But I have the backbone not to run away from my responsibilities! \nAPRIL It takes backbone to lead the life you want, Frank. \nHe shakes his head and gets up. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) Where are you going? \nFRANK Is it alright with you if I go to the bathroom? \nShe disgustedly twists out her cigarette, and immediately lights another. \nFRANK April, you just said our daughter was mistake. How do I know you didn't try to get rid of her, or Michael for that matter? How do I know you didn't try to flush our entire fucking family down the toilet? \nAPRIL No that's not true. Of course I didn't. \nFRANK But how do I know April? \nAPRIL Stop.   Please just stop, Frank. \nFRANK April, a normal woman, a normal sane mother doesn't buy herself a piece of rubber tubing to give herself an abortion so she can, go live out some God damn fantasy. \nApril's face. \nFRANK (CONT'D) (sober) All I'm saying is you don't seem entirely rational about this thing... And maybe we should get someone to help you think about it. \nAPRIL ...And the new job's going to pay for that too? \nFRANK April if you need a shrink, it'll be paid for. Obviously. \nApril turns to the book shelves.   Her back to him. \nFrank waits, his heart beating quickly. \nAPRIL ...Okay. I guess there isn't much more to say, then, is there? \nHer eyes are bright with tears. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) So I guess Paris was a pretty childish idea, huh? \nEverything hangs on Frank's answer... \nFRANK I guess maybe it was. \nApril closes her eyes. Tears run down her cheeks.   He walks over to her, but he doesn't touch her. \nFRANK (CONT'D) We can be happy here April...   I can make you happy here. \nShe cries quietly. \nFRANK (CONT'D) We've had a great few months.   It doesn't have to end... \nShe turns to face him. \nFRANK (CONT'D) We're going to be okay. \nAPRIL I hope so Frank.   I really hope so. \nINT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - MORNING. \nFrank stands at the picture window watching... \nApril approach the children. She squats on the ground so she can be at their height and talks to them. Michael tries to get into her arms. Jennifer turns away and walks sulkily across the grass. \nFrank looks into his coffee cup.   He doesn't look like a man who won an argument. \nINT. KNOX WAITING ROOM - DAY. \nFrank sits smoking nervously in an oak-paneled waiting room. The door opens behind him. He gets to his feet. \nRECEPTIONIST Thank you for waiting.   Mr. Pollock can see you now. \nHe follows her through the door.    The door closes behind her. \nWe see the scene in dumb-show through the glass door. Bart looks up as Frank enters. An \"I knew it all along\" smile spreads across Pollock's face. He offers his hand to Frank. Frank smiles thinly. They shake. \nJACK (O.S) Foiled by faulty contraception. \nINT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT - DAY. \nFrank, Ed, Vince and Jack sit in the same booth in the same crowded luncheonette. \nMILLY (CONT'D) (tipsy) Guess April's pretty blue `bout Paris, huh? \nFRANK Think she'll be okay? \nMILLY Oh, sure. Give us girls a couple of days and we can get over anything! \nFrank turns his attention to Milly. He's a good dancer. His movements are fast and aggressive, his mind on April. \nMilly is a little too drunk, and hurries to keep up, perspiring through her dress. He spins her around and around, back and forth into his arms. Milly begins to look slightly dizzy. \nMILLY (CONT'D) ...Frank. \nHe doesn't hear her over the music, or he doesn't care. \nMILLY (CONT'D) Frank... I... \nFRANK (sudden remorse) You okay? \nMILLY Gee...I'm afraid I'm not very... \nHer body spasms with the need to be sick. She turns and rushes for the lady's room. \nEXT. VITO'S LOG CABIN - NIGHT. \nFrank leads the way through the cars. \nShep supports Milly who is now falling down drunk. \nApril walks alone a few paces behind... \nThey reach Shep's car, which is trapped behind several other cars. \nSHEP Of all the inconsiderate... \nA beat.   Frank looks to April. \nAPRIL Look - why don't you take Milly home, then go home yourself and that would take care of both sitters. Then Shep can take me home later. \nSHEP All right with me. \nFRANK (to April) You'll be alright? \nAPRIL Sure. \nFrank holds April's look an instant, then walks away with car keys in hand. \nINT. VITO'S LOG CABIN - NIGHT. \nSteve Kovack performs an exhausting, sweat-drenched drum solo. \nApril and Shep now sit alone in the booth. \nSHEP I'm sorry you're not going away anymore. I know it was important to you. \nApril distantly nods her thanks. \nSHEP (CONT'D) Don't take this wrong; I've been there and...they don't have so much we don't have here. \nAPRIL It didn't have to be Paris. \nShep sips his beer, trying to figure out how to connect with her... \nSHEP You just wanted out, huh? \nAPRIL I wanted in. I just wanted us to live again. \nShep nods, not entirely sure what she means. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) For years I thought we shared a secret...that we would be wonderful in the world. I didn't exactly know how, but just the possibility...kept me hoping. \nHe walks over to her.   He takes her in his arms.   She stiffens. \nFRANK Look, this has been kind of a crazy summer. We've both been under a strain. I mean I know you're upset. \nAPRIL You know I'm not sleeping with you and you want to know why? \nShe looks him straight in the eye. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) Well, I'm sorry Frank, but I don't really feel like talking about it. \nShe pulls herself free of his grasp. He watches as she adds the vegetables in the pot on the stove. \nFRANK Okay. What do you feel like talking about? \nAPRIL Would it be all right if we didn't talk about anything? Can't we just take each day as it comes, and do the best we can, and not feel we have to talk about everything all the time? \nHe smiles patiently. \nFRANK I don't think I suggested we talk about everything all the time. My point was, we've both been under a strain and we ought to be trying to help each other as much as we can right now. \nShe's utterly uninterested and it's making him nervous. \nFRANK (CONT'D) I mean God knows my own behavior has been pretty weird lately... I mean, as it happens... there is actually something I'd like to tell you about... \nShe continues folding the napkins. \nFRANK (CONT'D) I've been with a girl in the city a few times. \nFinally, she stops moving.   She looks at him. \nFRANK (CONT'D) A girl I hardly even know. It was nothing to me, but she got a little carried away. She's just a kid... Anyway, it's over now. It's really over. If I weren't sure of that I guess I could never have told you about it. \nAPRIL Why did you? \nFRANK (relieved) Baby, I don't know. I think it was a simple case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business. Some kind of neurotic, irrational need to prove something. \nAPRIL No. I don't mean why did you have the girl; I mean why did you tell me about it? \nHe is suddenly unsure. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) I mean what's the point? Is it supposed to make me jealous, or something? Is it supposed to make me fall in love with you, or back into bed with you, or what? I mean what am I supposed to say? \nHe tries that same patient smile, but it's not convincing. \nFRANK Why don't you say what you feel? \nAPRIL I don't feel anything. \nFRANK In other words you don't care what I do or who I fuck or anything? \nAPRIL No; I guess that's right; I don't. \nShe is frighteningly calm. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) Fuck who you like. \nHis panic mounts. \nFRANK Don't you see...Don't you see, I want you to care. \nAPRIL Oh, I know you do. And I suppose I would if I loved you. But you see I don't think I do anymore. And I only just figured that out. And that's why I'd just as soon not do any talking right now. \nShe goes back into the kitchen. Frank follows her. \nFRANK Oh, now don't give me this shit! You know God damn well you love me! \nAPRIL You think so?! \nFRANK You know GOD DAMN WELL! \nJohn holds up his hand. \nJOHN What happened, Frank? You get cold feet, or what? You decide you're better off here after all? You figure it's more comfy here in the old Hopeless Emptiness after all, or -- \nFrank's face. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Wow, that did it! Look at his face! What's the matter, Wheeler? Am I getting warm? \nFrank stares at John, his rage increasing.   Mr. Givings gets to his feet. \nMR. GIVINGS (CONT'D) All right, son. I think we'd better be -- \nJOHN Boy! \nHe lets out his braying laugh.   April starts to laugh. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Boy! You know something? I wouldn't be surprised if you knocked her up on purpose just so you could spend the rest of your life hiding behind that maternity dress. That way you never have to find out what he's made of. \nFRANK Now look, I think that's just about enough out of you. I mean, who the hell do you think you are? You come in here and say whatever crazy God damn thing comes into your head and I think it's about time someone told you to keep your God damn - \nMRS. GIVINGS He's not well, Frank. \nFRANK Not well, my ass! I don't give a damn if he's sick or well or dead or alive, he should keep his fucking opinions in the fucking insane asylum where they belong! \nApril stares at Frank. \nMR. GIVINGS Let's go, son. \nMr. Givings moves John towards the door. Mrs. Givings slowly stands. April is the only one left seated. \nJOHN Big man you got there, April. \nHe winks at April and puts his hat on. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Big family man, solid citizen. I feel sorry for you. Still, maybe you deserve each other. \nApril's face. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Matter of fact, the way you look right now, I'm beginning to feel sorry for him, too. I mean, you must give him a pretty bad time, if making babies is the only way he can prove he's got a pair of balls. \nFRANK You... fucking..! \nFrank lunges at John. Mr. Givings tries to hold Frank back. Mrs. Givings leaps between them. She's crying. \nMRS. GIVINGS He's not well, Frank! \nSilence.   Mr. Givings slowly releases Frank.   He is breathing heavily. \nMR. GIVINGS All right, John. Let's get on out to the car now. \nHe guides him from the room. \nMRS. GIVINGS I'm sorry April, I'm so sorry... \nJOHN Right... Sorry, sorry, sorry! Okay Ma? Have I said `Sorry' enough times? I am sorry, too. Damn; I bet I'm just about the sorriest bastard I know. Course, get right down to it, I don't have a whole hell of a lot to be glad about, do I? \nHe takes another step towards the door, then stops and turns back, laughing again. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Hey, but I'm glad about one thing, though. \nHe points a yellow-stained finger at April's stomach. \nJOHN (CONT'D) You know what I'm glad about? I'm glad I'm not gonna be that kid. \nThey go out. \nFrank goes to the liquor cabinet, pours a whiskey and drinks it. \nApril watches him from across the room. \nFrank enters the bedroom and slams the door. \nHe paces, slowly calming. \nHe sits on the bed with his head in his hands... His mind racing. Then he's on his feet again. He rushes for the door. \nINT. WHEELER KITCHEN - EVENING. \nFrank enters, running, but the kitchen is empty.   Frank runs out of the room into living room. \nINT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - EVENING \nThe living room is empty.   He goes straight for the front door. \nEXT. WHEELER HOUSE - EVENING. \nFrank bursts out the front and comes to a stop. \nShe's across the street - climbing unsteadily into the woods... \nFrank breaks into a sprint. \nEXT. WOODS - EVENING. \nApril walks through the woods. \nFrank runs up behind her, scrambling through the muddy bracken. \nApril wheels around. \nAPRIL Don't come any closer. \nFRANK April, listen, I -- \nAPRIL Don't come any closer. Can't I even get away from you in the fucking woods? \nHe stops moving. \nFRANK April, listen, I didn't mean that. Honestly; I didn't mean what I said. \nAPRIL Are you still talking? Isn't there any way to stop your talking? I NEED to think. Can't you see that? \nShe backs up against a tree trunk, looking down at him. \nFRANK Please come back.     What're you doing out here? \nAPRIL Do you want me to scream again, Frank? Because I will, if you say another word! I mean it! \nFrank has no choice - they're outside. The neighbors would hear and call the police. He reluctantly backs away, then turns back the way he came, glancing over his shoulder as he goes. \nINT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT. \nFrank stands at the window watching the section of woods where he left April. \nThen, he sees her come back across the street. She walks around the side of the house. He turns and runs into the kitchen. \nINT. WHEELER KITCHEN - NIGHT. \nFrank goes to the window. He watches April walk up into the yard and stop against a tree. \nFrank pours a drink and takes the bottle with him to the window. He looks out, drinking. \nIn the darkness, he can make out the glow of April's cigarette deep in the woods. \nINT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT, LATER. \nFrank falls back on the bed. \nHe's now very drunk. \nHe stands.    April stands up too, smoothing her skirt. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Listen, though, April; this was really nice... I mean it was a swell breakfast. Really; I don't know when I've ever had a -- a nicer breakfast. \nAPRIL Thank you... I'm glad; I enjoyed it too. \nThey stand there gazing at one another across the table. Suddenly, inexplicably, his eyes are filled with tears. \nHe turns and walks to the door. He puts his hand on the handle and turns back once more. \nFRANK Then you don't -- You don't hate me, or anything? \nAPRIL No; of course I don't. \nShe comes over to him. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) Have a good day. \nHe leans down and kisses her tenderly.   They look at one another a moment longer. \nFRANK Okay, then... So long. \nHe steps through the door. She catches the door before it shuts and watches him through the screen. \nEXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING. \nApril walks out onto the driveway as the car reverses away down the drive. \nINT. WHEELER CAR - MORNING. \nFrank backs the car onto the road. He slides the car into drive and then catches sight of April in the driveway. \nEXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING. \nApril sees Frank looking back at her.    She waves.   Frank waves from the car and drives off... \nThen April is alone. She shivers from the morning chill. She turns and looks back at the house. \nINT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING. \nApril enters through the screen door and goes to the table. She looks down at Frank's diagram and carefully places it aside. \nShe carries the dishes to the sink and begins to wash them. \nSuddenly, her body convulses as she tries to hold back from crying. And then there is no stopping the tears... \nINT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING. \nApril is standing by the phone, with her hand on the receiver, rehearsing. She is smoking. She dials. \nAPRIL Hello... Milly? Everything all right? My voice sounds what...? \nApril uses both hands to grip the receiver. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not feeling any better... If it's not an inconvenience for you... This evening would be great. What...? Oh, well- no, not if they're outdoors playing. Don't call them in. \nThe cigarette shreds in April's hand. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) Just give them - you know, give them each a kiss for me, and give them my love, and tell them - you know... All right, Milly. Thanks. \nShe hangs up and begins to cry again.   Takes a breath. \nINT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING. \nFOOTSTEPS... \nWe move behind April as she walks through the silent house. \nThe distant SOUND of children playing outside. \n", "test1_input": "Overlapping: \nMILLY What? \nSHEP When? \nMILLY Why? \nFRANK September. \nBeat.   Then: \nMILLY But what for? \nFRANK What for? Because we've always wanted to. Because the kids are still young. Because it's beautiful. Shep, you tell her. \nSHEP ...It's a great city. \nMilly glances nervously at Shep. \nMILLY When did you make this decision? \nAPRIL Oh... about a week ago... its hard to remember. We just suddenly decided to go, that's all. \nMILLY About a week ago, and you tell us now! \nAPRIL We had to get used to the idea. \nShep forces himself across the room and hands the Wheelers their drinks. \nSHEP So, what's the deal, Frank? You get a job over there, or what? \nFRANK (smiles) No. Not exactly. \nSHEP What do you mean, `not exactly?' \nAPRIL Frank won't be doing any kind of a job, because I will. \nSHEP (to Frank) And what are you going to do? \nFRANK I'm going to study... and I'm going to read and... I suppose I'm going to finally figure out what I want to do with my life. \nSHEP ...While she supports you? \nBeat. \nFRANK Yes. While she supports me...   At least in the beginning. \nAPRIL You wouldn't believe what they pay for secretarial work in government agencies over there. NATO and E.C.A. and those places. \nFRANK The cost of living is dirt cheap compared to here, so we should be all right. \nBeat. \nAPRIL The truth is we just need something different. (MORE) \nAPRIL (CONT'D) We're not getting any younger and we don't want life to just pass us by. \nMILLY Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids. I mean it; it really sounds wonderful. We'll certainly miss you, though - won't we, sweetie? Golly. \nSHEP Sure. \nMILLY Paris.   Wow. \nA   silence.   Shep's face. \nINT. MILLY AND SHEP'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. \nMilly sits on the edge of the bed in her night gown.   She is brushing her hair. \n", "test1_true": "SHEP You know what I think? \nMilly looks up. \nSHEP (CONT'D) I think this whole plan sounds a little immature. \nMilly's face brightens. \nMILLY Oh God, I'm so relieved. Me too... I was thinking that the whole time. \nSHEP What kind of man is going to sit around in his bathrobe picking his nose while his wife works all day? \nMILLY I don't know, Shep.   I just don't know. \nMilly is crying. \nSHEP What is it? \nMILLY Nothing.   I'm just so relieved. \nHe sits down beside her.   She falls into his arms. \nSHEP Come on. Don't cry. Please. It's all right. It's going to be all right. \nA kid's shout from somewhere in the house.     Milly sits up. \nSHEP (CONT'D) I'll go. \nINT. WHEELER KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT. \nFrank and April burst into the kitchen, laughing. \nFRANK Jesus, their faces! You'd think we'd told them that we were swimming up the Yangtzee river or something. \nLaughing, April hands Frank a drink. \nFRANK (CONT'D) You know what this is like, April? Talking like this? The whole idea of taking off to Europe this way? It's like the way I felt going up to the line the first time, in the war. I was probably just as scared as everyone else, but inside I never felt better. I felt alive. I felt full of blood. (MORE) \nFRANK (CONT'D) And everything looked more real. The guys in their uniforms. The snow on the fields, the trees. And all of us just... walking. I mean I was scared of course. But I kept thinking: this is it. This is the truth. \nAPRIL I felt that way once too. \nHe looks at her.   And there's something in her eyes. \nFRANK When? \nAPRIL The first time you made love to me. \nHe walks over to her and kisses her passionately. \nAnd they make love that way, face to face, with the lights on, looking into each other's eyes, fully clothed, until he comes inside her. \nAs he comes, she makes a sound, almost inaudible, but it sounds like... \nAPRIL (CONT'D) ...No \nHe holds her, breathing heavily.    She strokes his head. \nINT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR - DAY. \nFrank walks across the 15th floor, the atmosphere unusually abuzz. \nHe arrives in his cubicle. Jack, Ed and Vance are talking in hushed tones. \nFRANK What's up? \nED Bart Pollock is here. \n", "test2_input": "VINCE He's in Bandy's office. \nFRANK (unimpressed) Yeah? \nA small signal light illuminates on Frank's desk. \nED Looks like he wants to talk to you. \nFrank looks around. They're all looking at him.     He looks over in the direction of Bandy's office. \nJACK Hey.   Keep my name out of it. \nINT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, BANDY'S OFFICE - DAY \nBandy looks up from his desk.   An uncharacteristic smile. \nBANDY (warm) Frank. How are you? You know Bart Pollock? \nFRANK Well, we've never met, but - \nA massive MAN in tan gaberdine rises up from a chair. \nBART POLLOCK Glad to know you Frank. \nHe holds a file in his enormous hand. \nBART POLLOCK (CONT'D) Speaking of production control? \nFrank looks away, ready for a dressing down. \nBART POLLOCK (CONT'D) Frank... This is a crackerjack. They're just tickled to death in Toledo. \nHe slaps the file on the desk.    Frank can't believe it. \nINT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DAY. \nClose of a book: \"Brighter French.\" \nFrank sits on the couch, flipping absently. \nFRANK You wouldn't have believed this guy. \nApril enters carrying a plate of sandwiches. \nFRANK (CONT'D) He's perfect Presidential material in the worst sense. A million dollar smile and about three pounds of muscle between his ears. (mimicking Pollock's booming voice) \"Frank, this is a crackerjack.\" \nApril looks around to be sure everything's in place. \nAPRIL Wish I saw his face when you told him you were leaving. \nFrank looks away. \nFRANK ...Horse's ass. \nTOOT of a car horn.   April goes to the window. \nAPRIL I think this is them. \nINT./EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - DAY. \nThrough the picture window, we see the Givings' car is parked in the driveway. \nMrs. Givings gets out of the car holding a tinfoil covered baking pan. Mr. Givings opens the backseat. \nOut steps JOHN, 30's, an institutional haircut and ill- fitting suit. He looks around the sunny neighborhood. \nINT. WHEELER KITCHEN - DAY. \nThe kitchen is suddenly crowded with the Givings, Frank and April. \n", "test2_true": "MRS. GIVINGS Sorry to be late. \nAPRIL You're not late. \nMRS. GIVINGS The traffic was terrible. \nMR. GIVINGS Good to see you. \nMRS. GIVINGS Wasn't it terrible, Howard? \nMR. GIVINGS Route 12. \nHands are shook, the baking dish exchanged. \nAPRIL You didn't have to do that. \nFRANK The time they finish that stretch of road, they'll have to start all over again. \nJohn stands by himself closest to the door. \nAPRIL And you must be John? \nSilence settles over the room. \nMRS. GIVINGS Say hello, John. \nJOHN Nice to meetcha.   Heard a lot aboutcha. \nJohn smiles, exposing a mouthful of deeply-stained yellow teeth and high, eroded gums. \nINT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DAY. \nMrs. Givings leads the group into the living room. \nMRS. GIVINGS Where are your darling children? \nAPRIL They're at a birthday party.     Sorry they couldn't be here. \nJohn walks around the room, stiff-legged, examining the book shelves, the paintings. \nJOHN Don't worry. If I had a certified lunatic coming around the house, I'd probably get the kids out of the way too. \nApril and Frank exchange a quick glance. \nMRS. GIVINGS Oh, look at all this food! You didn't have to go to any trouble for us. \nAPRIL It's just some sandwiches. \nApril lifts the plate and offers it to John. \nAPRIL (CONT'D) John, would you like a sandwich? \nHe avoids her look, but he takes four. \nJOHN Helen's been talking it up about you people for months. (MORE) \nJOHN (CONT'D) The nice young Wheelers on Revolutionary Road, the nice young Revolutionaries on Wheeler road. \nPolite laughter. \nFRANK Who'd like some sherry? \nMRS. GIVINGS Please, don't bother Frank. \nJOHN I'd like some sherry. And I'll drink Helen's if she doesn't beat me to it. \nApril can't suppress a smile. \n", "test3_input": "FRANK My God. \nSHEP Here, have a cigarette. \nShep offers the pack.   Frank doesn't take one. \nFRANK She did it to herself, Shep. \nShep's face as he realizes what he's saying. \nFRANK (CONT'D) She did it to herself. \nShep takes a cigarette for himself.   He lights it with trembling fingers. \nSHEP I'll get some coffee. \nFrank looks over at Shep as if he'd forgotten him.   He nods. \nShep stands and walks down the hall. \nINT. HOSPITAL - COFFEE MACHINE - AFTERNOON. \nShep stands at a coffee machine, gathering himself. He looks up. He begins to feed coins into the machine. His hands are trembling. He drops a coin. It rolls under the machine. He has to get down on his hands and knees to retrieve it... \nINT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON. \nShep walks tentatively, holding a cup in each hand, slopping coffee onto the floor... \nHe rounds the corner and stops. \nFrank is no longer in his chair at the end of the long echoing hallway. Shep looks around... \nThen suddenly, the double doors are flung open and a number of nurses hurry out. Behind them, comes Frank, supported by two Doctors. \nShep runs to them as they move Frank over to a chair.    He's in shock. \nFRANK No.   No.   No. \nThey try to make him sit, but he stays stubbornly on his feet, the chair skidding behind him. \nDOCTOR Try to sit down, Mr. Wheeler. \nSHEP Sit down Frank. \nFrank looks at Shep - his face is a terrifying blank. \nEXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD - MAGIC HOUR. \nA toyland of white and pastel houses along the road. The crisp green lawns. The blue televisions flickering behind the glass. \nWe hear the WHISK of running footsteps on the asphalt, the rush of a man's breath... \nFrank is running down the middle of the street, tears streaming silently down his face... \nINT. CAMPBELL LIVING ROOM - EVENING, ONE YEAR LATER. \nFour high-ball glasses with glistening cubes of ice. \nShep puts the finishing touches on four drinks. \nMR. and MRS. BRACE, a pleasant looking young couple fresh from the city sit on the couch. \nMILLY ...It was the worst experience of my life. Such wonderful people. Weren't they Shep? Poor April. \nShep picks up the drinks and carries them across the room. He stands there beside the three of them, but he can't bring himself to sit down and join in. \nMILLY (CONT'D) Frank lives in the city now.       Where is it he works? \nSHEP Bart Pollock Associates. \n", "test3_true": "Mr. Brace removes his pipe and looks at it. \nMRS. BRACE Have you seen him since? \nMILLY No. Too many memories, I think. Shep's seen him. In the city. \nShep nods. \nMILLY (CONT'D) He's just dedicated to those kids. Every spare moment he has, he spends with them... \nShep turns and walks out of the room. \nEXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - EVENING. \nShep walks across the lawn to the edge of the property. He looks out over the suburban houses. At what was once the Wheeler house. \nShep's face, looking out. His eyes are filled with tears. Milly comes up behind him. \nMILLY You okay? \nSHEP Mm-hmm. \nShe takes his arm and holds him close. \nSHEP (CONT'D) I don't want to talk about The Wheelers any more. \nMILLY Okay. We don't have to.     We don't have to. \nShep and Milly look out over Revolutionary Road. \nEXT. CITY PARK - DAY. \nThe same silence over a beautiful day in the city.    And from the silence, the faint sound of wind through the leafy branches of trees. \nTwo children play in a playground in a small park. \nIt's Jennifer and Michael.    They seem happy, engrossed. Other kids play around them. \nWatching them from a bench is Frank.   He is a little older, a little thinner. \nClose on Frank's face.   The SOUND of his children playing. \nINT. GIVINGS' LIVING ROOM - DAY \nMrs. Givings crouches on a cotton work sheet painting varnish onto a chair. Mr. Givings sits reading the paper. \nA new puppy sleeps curled up on the rug nearby. \nMRS. GIVINGS I can't tell you how pleased I am about the little Revolutionary Road place, Howard. Remember how dreary it looked all winter? All cold and dark and -- well, spooky. Creepy- crawly.

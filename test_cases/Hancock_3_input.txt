ADAMS Games. I don't need it. 
RUTGER Fuck games, fuck dames. 
ADAMS I got a'wife, I don't need the aggravation... 
RUTGER Take a donut hole. The entrance. Horus wanders in, lost in this environment. He finds the front counter. The cops watch him. 
HORUS A cup of coffee, please. Holly takes the order. Leaves to fetch it. 
ADAMS (O.S.) Longfellow. 
HORUS (turns; with dread) How are you, John? 
(RUTGER) Frank? 
ADAMS (god, I'm funny) Observe anything worth recording, lately? 
HORUS You know... things are slow. 
RUTGER Not for Samsone Electronics on fifth. Got hit on Thursday. 
ADAMS The guard, he was cut-up like a piece of meat. 
RUTGER Anything go wrong, you make sure you notify us, the authorities. No heroics without a license. You know the procedure. Horus - he knows the procedure. 
ADAMS Of course he does. 
RUTGER Of course. Holly returns with the coffee. Hands it to Horus - free of charge. From the back, Soon-yi intervenes... 
SOON-YI He no have gun. Not copper. 
HOLLY Oh, I thought... 
SOON-YI He regular guy. Sixty-five cents for regular.guy. Horus - somebody shoot him. 
INT. AARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Mary's folding clothes by the dresser, busy with thought. Aaron squats on the bed, his brain going a mile a minute. He plops back against the bed. Brings his hand up to his face. Makes a fist. Thinking. Wondering. 
MARY What're you doing? She's taken by this scene. 
AARON (releases fist) Thinking. Mary goes over to the bed. Sits. 
MARY About him? 
AARON No. Not really. Are you? 
MARY No. They're lying through their collective teeth. 
AARON Me neither. I was thinking.., about tomorrow. 
MARY Go to sleep. You know what dad says. Tomorrow always feels better... 
AARON I know, mom... after a good night sleep. He says that but he's the one working every night. Does that mean he never feels better? He's always feeling terrible? 
MARY 
(AMUSED) Go to bed, anyway. She tucks him-in.. Turns off the lamp. And as she's out the door... 
AARON Mom? She turns. 
AARON (CONT'D) 
(CONTINUING) Who is Mr. Penis?

DANTE I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even. 
CUSTOMER (considerably calmer; takes money) This is the last time I ever come here. (to RANDAL) And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open! 
The CUSTOMER leaves, wiping water from his face. RANDAL salutes him. 
DANTE (angrily) What the fuck did you do that for? 
RANDAL Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines. 
DANTE Jesus! 
RANDAL And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior. 
DANTE What? 
RANDAL If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice. (extends opened palm) Agreed? 
DANTE (shakes his head; hands over keys) You're a danger to both the dead and the living. 
RANDAL I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny. 
DANTE Please, get the hell out of here. 
RANDAL I know I'm your hero. 
RANDAL exits. 
CUT TO: 
INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY 
DANTE waits on a customer (TRAINER). He lifts the gallon of milk into a paper bag, letting out a slight grunt. 
TRAINER Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym. 
DANTE Excuse me? 
TRAINER I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds. 
DANTE I didn't strain. I sighed. 
TRAINER I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape. 
DANTE I don't think so. 
TRAINER Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized. 
DANTE They are not. 
TRAINER Yes, they are. You're out of shape. 
DANTE What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body. 
TRAINER No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise. 
A female customer (HEATHER) leans in the doorway. 
HEATHER Are you open? 
DANTE Yes. 
HEATHER (grabs a paper) Just the paper. 
DANTE (to HEATHER) Thirty-fire. 
TRAINER (to HEATHER) Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape? 
HEATHER (studies DANTE) I don't know. I can't really tell from here. 
TRAINER He is. 
DANTE I am not. 
TRAINER How much can you bench? 
DANTE I don't know. 
HEATHER (studying DANTE) I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops. 
DANTE I know I can bench more than that! 
TRAINER I think the lady called it. 
HEATHER My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy. 
TRAINER I do about three-fifty, four. 
HEATHER No way! 
TRAINER (rolling up sleeve) Feel that. 
HEATHER That's tight. Solid. 
TRAINER Now feel his. (to DANTE) Roll up your sleeve, chief. 
DANTE Oh for God's sake!

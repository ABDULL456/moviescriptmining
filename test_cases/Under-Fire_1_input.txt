The soldier stops at Tacho's name. Price turns. 
P.O.V. ALEX AND CLAIRE KISSING GOODBYE 
PRICE TURNS AGAIN, embarrassed, faces the soldier. 
PRICE Don't look, huh? (beat) No mire! 
The soldier, confused, turns away, and as he does: 
ALEX SLAPS PRICE ON THE SHOULDER, AND THEY TOO EMBRACE 
ALEX Don't get hurt. 
PRICE Ahh, I'm a chicken, don't worry. (beat) Alex, listen to me... 
ALEX Yeah? 
PRICE Within a year you're gonna be one of the "Ten Most Admired Men in America." 
Alex is amused, Price is serious. The cabbie comes out and Alex heads into the airport.

EXT. SOMOZA'S COMPOUND - A PRESS LUNCHEON - DAY 
Daisy and her combo from the Viking Club perform "The Girl From Ipanema" as ONE HUNDRED PRESS MEMBERS and V.I.P.'s sit at long tables in the garden. The pleasantness of the surroundings is countered by the presence of dozens of SOLDIERS in the background, guarding the house, etc. Visible at the head table are: TWO GENERALS AND THEIR WIVES, MRS. SOMOZA, TWO WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN, MISS PANAMA IN A FLOPPY HAT. Elsewhere mingling are: JAZY, ISELA, PRICE, REGIS. An elaborate array of food sits on the table. 
INT. SOMOZA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Overlooking the gathering from his private living room, Somoza grants Claire her interview. He close the window to muffle the singing. 
CLAIRE You're late to your own luncheon, Mr. President -- we can schedule this for another time. 
SOMOZA Nonsense -- let them wait. We are a stunning couple, eh? My stomach is very flat -- I've been working out. 
CLAIRE We are a stunning couple. Mr. President, you own one fifth of all the land in Nicaragua, you own the shipping port, the national airlines, the Mercedes dealership... 
SOMOZA I am on a salt free diet... 
He takes her hand and leads her to two large portraits hanging on a wall -- his parents. 
CLAIRE Do you always hold hands with reporters? 
SOMOZA (ignores her) This is my mother and father. They were very special to me. Every Sunday morning I drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on their grave. I think people should know that. 
CLAIRE Would you care to comment on the fall of Leon to the rebels? 
Somoza just smiles unaffected by her questions; she knows the game is undaunted.

EXT. THE LUNCHEON TABLES - DAY 
Hub Kittle is bending Price's ear in the crowd. Price seems ammused and watches the anthem contest as he munches food. 
HUB Listen, Russell, let's grow up. It's very easy to fall in love with the underdog, eh? But there's an upside and downside to this thing -- just wanta remind you... this stuff about a "Revolution of Poets" is crap. 
PRICE But it's great P.R. So what's the upside? 
HUB Simple. And it could happen. Somoza destroys the terrorist insurgents, rebuilds the country, shitcans the purveyors of excess, stabilizes the cordoba, and is finally beloved as the savior of Nicaragua. (beat) Our pal. Got a smoke? 
Price gives him a cigaret. 
PRICE What's the downside? 
HUB The Commies take over the world. 
It's simple, and Hub is pleased with his presentation. A SOLDIER moves through the crowd looking quite out of place, finds Hub and hands him a note. Hub reads it, seems delighted, and excuses himself from the table. 
HUB Excuse me, gentlemen, but the war may be over. 
Price and Regis look at each other strangely -- what's he talking about? They shrug, Regis bites into a papaya, and Hub hurries inside. Price and Regis watch the singer.

INT. SECOND FLOOR OF SOMOZA'S HOUSE - DAY 
SOMOZA My people love me. My stomach is flat. Did I say that already? No matter. It is flat. 
CLAIRE There are reports that the Guardia operates a torture chamber at Coyotepe. 
Somoza ignores the question and reopens the window, flooding the room with the Tony Bennett classic. 
SOMOZA I like this song. 
CLAIRE Since the earthquake in 1972 destroyed half of Managua, over three hundred million dollars in foreign relief aid have poured into the country, yet nothing has been re-built. It is said that the money has gone into your pocket. 
SOMOZA I love the press, I really do. Some of my best friends are journalists.

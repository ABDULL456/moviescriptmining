SUSAN Get back! 
SOUNDS OF KIDS GRIPING 
Susan and Peter fall backwards. 
IN NARNIA 
SUSAN Impossible! 
LUCY Don't worry, it's probably just your imagination 
PETER I don't suppose saying we're sorry would quite cover it? 
LUCY No, it wouldn't. But this might! 
Lucy nails Peter in the face with a snowball, he throws one back at her and a snowball fight 
begins. Susan hits Ed in the arm with one 
EDMUND Ow! (rubs his arm) Stop it! (They all realize that Ed lied) 
PETER You little liar! 
EDMUND You didn't believe her either! 
PETER Apologize to Lucy. (He just looks at her) 
PETER Say you're sorry! (Peter steps up to him) 
EDMUND Alright! I'm sorry. 
LUCY That's alright, some little children just don't know when to stop pretending. (looks at him smugly) 
EDMUND (mutters): Very funny. 
SUSAN Maybe we should go back 
EDMUND Can't we at lease take a look around?

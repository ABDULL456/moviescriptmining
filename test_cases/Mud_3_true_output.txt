102 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT 102 
Ellis and Neckbone motor away from the island in the flat bottom boat. They look back at the shore. 
ELLIS You think it's all right to leave him alone?! 
NECKBONE I doubt it! Neckbone sees Ellis' concern. 
NECKBONE (CONT'D) I'll sleep over at your house tonight! We can check on him first thing tomorrow! Ellis nods. As they head further up river, the island grows smaller, silhouetted by the moonlight. 
103 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - MORNING 103 
Neckbone snores, sprawled out on top of a sleeping bag on the floor. Ellis sits up in bed with something on his mind. He gets up and steps gingerly over Neckbone to exit the room. 
104 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - CONTINUOUS 104 
The house is silent. Ellis slips into the kitchen and picks up the phone receiver mounted on the cabinet. 
He pulls the cord out to stand with his face in the corner. He dials, waits, and speaks softly into the receiver. 
ELLIS Hello? Is May Pearl there...This is Ellis...I called yesterday, you give her my message?...My name is Ellis. I'm her boyfriend...Oh, she's asleep...I said she's asleep? The front door flies open. Senior storms headlong toward Ellis. He shouts. 
SENIOR 
MARY LEE! Ellis turns as Senior yanks the phone by the cord. It snaps out of Ellis' hand and smashes apart on the floor. Ellis flinches at the sight of his father flying at him. 
SENIOR (CONT'D) What the hell have you been doing? 
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOIN'?!! Senior grabs Ellis by the arms and shoves him against the den wall. Mary Lee comes running from her room. 
MARY LEE 
SENIOR! SENIOR DAMMIT! She slaps at her husband's arms and back. He swats her away. 
SENIOR You tell her. You tell her what you've been up to. 
ELLIS I don't know what you're sayin'. 
MARY LEE Take your hands off him Senior! Senior keeps Ellis pinned to the wall with his left hand. He opens up and addresses Mary Lee with his right. 
SENIOR J.J. Crawford said a boat motor went missin' from his stock yard. Said his daughter saw this one and his friend haulin' it off. This makes Mary Lee pause. 
SENIOR (CONT'D) Now you tell me right now, did you steal that motor? 
ELLIS We didn't steal it. 
SENIOR Lie to me again. 
ELLIS We thought it was junk. We didn't think it was worth anything. 
MARY LEE Ellis? A cool anger rushes over Senior's face. He releases Ellis and takes a step back. 
SENIOR You tell me I raised a thief? 
ELLIS I'm not a thief. 
SENIOR You take property that's not yours. Property that belongs to another man. That junk is his livelihood. I'm ashamed of you. Ellis drops his head. His face flushed. 
MARY LEE Senior. 
SENIOR (to Mary Lee) Shut your mouth. You think you can take things and not have him see it? Neither one of you has any respect for a man's livelihood. A life that puts clothes on your back and food in your stomach. 
MARY LEE Don't you blame this on me. One doesn't have a thing to do with the other and you know it. 
SENIOR Don't tell me what I know. If you can steal a man's life out from under him in front of your son and think he won't take a lesson from it than you're even dumber than you look. 
ELLIS Stop it dad. 
Senior volleys a finger at Ellis. 
SENIOR She's raisin' you a snake like herself, and you can curl up with her `fore I give a damn. You just remember this when you watch them rip this house apart board by board. You Hear Me! Mary Lee slaps Senior hard. He turns to her, saying nothing. 
MARY LEE You're a man who's never had the strength to support his own life. I never asked you for a thing, and I've never took a thing from you that I couldn't provide for on my own. If they do tear my home apart the only joy I'll have in my heart is knowin' that they'll be tearing you out of my life for good. She wipes her eyes and turns her attention to Ellis.

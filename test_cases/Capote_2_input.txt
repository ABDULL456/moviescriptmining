TRUMAN He's as short as I am. And almost as pretty. I'd be with him right now but he's being given new accommodations -- 
Guests laugh. 
TRUMAN Most people assume he's a monster. I don't see him that way. The book I'm writing will return him to the realm of humanity -- it's the book I was always meant to write... 
Nelle and Jack stand back, watching. 
JACK Watch out. This is the start of a great love affair. 
NELLE Oh yes. Truman in love with Truman. 
INT. LE PAVILLON RESTAURANT - DAY 
Truman is being interviewed over lunch. 
TRUMAN ...I was in Marilyn's apartment just last week. I had to break it to her that, of the four Matisses hanging on her wall, two were upside down. 
The REPORTER laughs. A waiter passes. Truman taps his glass. 
TRUMAN Another. (to reporter) To answer your question, I'm following "Breakfast at Tiffany's" by blazing a different path -- by inventing an entirely new kind of writing: the non-fiction novel. 
REPORTER You have a subject? 
Truman takes a last sip of his drink -- utterly serious now. 
TRUMAN On the night of November 14, two men broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family. Why did they do that? It's been suggested that this subject is tawdry -- it's not worthy of literature. I disagree. Two worlds exist in this country -- the quiet conservative life, and the life of those two men -- the underbelly, the criminally violent. Those worlds converged that bloody night. I spent the past three months interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by that violence. I spent hours talking to the killers -- and I'll spend more. (waiter brings his drink) Researching this work has changed my life, altered my point of view about almost everything. I think those who read it will be similarly affected. (he sips) Such a book can only be written by a journalist who has mastered the techniques of fiction -- 
REPORTER You're speaking of yourself. 
TRUMAN You're really very clever. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY 
Truman sits in bed, writing on a yellow LEGAL PAD, surrounded by PILES of notes. He squints his eyes, concentrating. Jack enters, delivers a CUP OF COFFEE. Truman doesn't notice. 
INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER 
Truman is rifling through the boxes, looking for particular notes. He can't find what he needs. The phone RINGS. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET, BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON 
Jack and Truman walk. 
TRUMAN Perry's decided to appeal. He claims their attorney was incompetent -- that he never raised the issue of temporary insanity. 
JACK So you find them a new lawyer. 
TRUMAN They're facing execution in six weeks, Jack. They need someone to argue whether or not that's right. 
JACK Okay. 
TRUMAN I'd also like to see them alive, yes, thank you very much. I need to hear their story. 
They walk in silence for a few moments. 
TRUMAN If you met him you'd understand. It's as if no-one's ever asked him a single question about himself. He's so... damaged -- and strange -- unexplored... (then) I don't trust this Hickock fellow. Perry's the only person who can describe to me what happened that night. I need to hear him say it. 
JACK Just be careful what you do to get what you want. 
TRUMAN I'm finding them a lawyer. 
JACK Truman. You're finding yourself a lawyer. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR, DRIVING, TWO-LANE KANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY

EXT. KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY (KSP), LANSING - DAY 
A turreted, Civil War-era fortress an hour's drive from Kansas City. Truman pulls up to the GUARDHOUSE.

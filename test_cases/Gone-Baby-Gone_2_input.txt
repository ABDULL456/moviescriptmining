The Police look at him. 
PATRICK (CONT' D) Look, I've cooperated. Unless you want me to go out there and start calling the papers to give 'em my Police corruption exclusive, I'm leaving. 
He gets up. 
CAPTAIN Calm down. 
(BEAT) You're released. But Mr. Kenize-- 
(WINKS) I hope you don't get pulled over any time soon. 
INT. PATRICK AND ANGIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Patrick comes into the office/living room. Angie is there. 
ANGIE What happened? 
PATRICK They kept my shoelaces. 
She smiles. 
ANGIE We'll go down to Zayre's tomorrow and get you some new ones. 
PATRICK I don't want to do that tomorrow. 
ANGIE What do you want to do? 
PATRICK Take a trip. 
EXT MASS TURNPIKE - DAY The car speeds along the empty highway, carving through thick forests of pine trees. Inside the car it's quiet. Patrick's stare is fixed to the road -- the rhythm of the white lines that pulse by. Angie rests her head against the passenger window, the BLUR of the tree-line reflected in her eyes. 
EXT . RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY A 2-LANE ROAD winds them through rolling hills and past a SIGN welcoming them to: 'WEST BECKETT, MA. Pop. 974' -- a Rockwell painting in the heart of the Berkshire Mountains. 
EXT TOWNSEND ROAD - MOMENTS LATER The car rolls down a quiet road where small COTTAGES nestle in clumps of birch and pine trees. Patrick parks opposite a long driveway. A MAILBOX at its mouth reads: DOYLE 
ROAD - AFTERNOON 
EXT. TOWNSEND 
Patrick and Angie sit in the car.   They look down a driveway. 
She takes a beat. 
ANGIE You want to tell me where our trip has taken us? 
PATRICK You know where we are. 
ANGIE 
(BEAT) He would never, ever do something to endanger a child. 
PATRICK Are you sure? 
ANGIE Yes. 
PATRICK He was a part of it. They don't tape calls. He handed us a transcript like it was evidence and he knew it was a forgery- -maybe he forged it himself. He knew what they were doing, he supported it and he covered it up. 
ANGIE Why? For a third of a hundred and thirty grand? What for? 
He just looks at her. 
PATRICK Had to be for something. 
ANGIE When you're talking about ruining an old man who lost his child and gave years of service . . . "something" isn't enough. 
PATRICK For a guy who tried to ruin us, something' s plenty. 
ANGIE This is the kind of thing where if you do it, you want to be sure. 
(BEAT) Are you sure? 
PATRICK No. 
(BEAT) Are you coming? 
ANGIE No. 
And he goes down the road. 
EXT DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
They start down the driveway towards a small, red cottage set a hundred yards or so off the road. But after only a few steps, they stop. PATRICK & ANGIE'S POV: Through the trees, Doyle emerges from the cottage. He carries 2 FULL SUITCASES to a SUBURBAN and loads them in the back. His wife, FRANCINE, follows. Patrick & Angie take a beat before resuming down the drive. Only to FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS at the sight of: 
AMANDA MCCREADY CHARGING ONTO THE PORCH, clutching a BACK- PACK, and wearing a look of utter determination. 
AMANDA Don't forget mine, gramma. 
FRANCINE I'd never forget yours, sweetheart. Doyle lifts Amanda off the porch and carries her to the Suburban. He dips down, allowing Amanda to place her back- pack inside. 
AMANDA Can I have a, please a sandwich? 
DOYLE What kind do you want. 
AMANDA Grill Cheese.

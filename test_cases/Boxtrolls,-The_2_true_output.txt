FISH (GURGLING EXCITED HELLOS) 
EGGS It's not just us. All the others are alive too! 
EGGS (CONT'D) We saw them! 
WINNIE (behind the crowd) What's going on?! 
EGGS (IGNORING HER) Oil Can, Wheels, all of them! 
SPECS (GURGLES) 
EGGS Yes! 
CLOCKS (GURGLED) Where are they? 
EGGS I don't know, but The Redhats have them building something in their factory. 
WINNIE (SHOUTING) I said what's going on? Why aren't they ripping out our eyeballs and eating our faces? 
The boxtrolls wince at the sound of Winnie's screaming voice and some of them drop into their boxes. Eggs turns to look at her. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) And where are the rivers of blood and mountains of bones?! I WAS PROMISED MOUNTAINS OF BONES! 
The rest of the boxtrolls squeak in fear and drop into their boxes. Eggs looks pointedly at the boxtrolls, then back at Winnie. 
EGGS I TOLD you, we don't eat people! 
WINNIE Why do you keep saying "we"? You're not one of them! You're a boy! 
EGGS (INCREDULOUS) No I'm not, I'm a boxtroll! Eggs the boxtroll. 
He points to his box like it's the most obvious thing in the world. 
WINNIE Oh really? Then let's see you fit in your box. 
EGGS I... I can't right now. 
WINNIE Mm hmm. 
EGGS (DEFENSIVELY} I'm long-boned. 
The surrounding boxtrolls gurgle in agreement with Eggs. But as his argument with Winnie gets louder the boxtrolls shrink away from the two humans. 
WINNIE You don't talk like them! 
EGGS I- I have a speech impediment! 
WINNIE Your ears aren't pointy! 
EGGS (tugging on his ears) I slept on them funny! 
Winnie is getting exasperated. 
WINNIE Oh for goodness sake. Give me your hand! 
Winnie lunges forward and grabs Eggs' hand, but he resists. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) (WRYLY) I don't bite. 
Eggs stops resisting and she quickly unwraps the rags from his hand. 
EGGS Hey! 
Winnie takes Fish's hand and holds it up next to Eggs hand. 
WINNIE See? You're not like them. 
She drops Fish's hand and holds up her own. She presses her hand to his hand, five fingers to five fingers. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) You're one of us. You're a boy, Eggs. Or should I call you the Trubshaw baby? 
A beat. Eggs pulls his hand away and stares at it, his face confused. 
Then he looks at Fish, who is looking at his own hand in bemusement. 
EGGS It's not true is it Fish? I'm a boxtroll like you, aren't I? 
Fish shakes his head, "No". Eggs looks dumbstruck. 
WINNIE See?! I was right! (TO FISH) Now admit it, admit you stole him! 
FISH Gurglegurglegurgle! 
WINNIE (TO EGGS) Is he confessing? 
EGGS He says I was... given to him. 
WINNIE Ha, right again! I- ...wait, what? 
Winnie and Eggs are both flabbergasted. 
EGGS I was given to you? 
Fish nods his head. Yup. 
Eggs' legs give way beneath him.    He stumbles back and sits down on the floor. 
EGGS (CONT'D) Who gave me to you?

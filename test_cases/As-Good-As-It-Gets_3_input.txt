MELVIN (as he turns toward her) I think of a man and take away reason and accountability. 
The fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close. 
EXT. STREET NEAR CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY 
A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home. She is suddenly wary -- SOUND DIALED DOWN -- as we MOVE CLOSER. 
CAROL'S POV 
A car at the curb with "MD" license plate. 
BACK TO SCENE 
As Carol breaks into a run. 
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWAY/HALLWAY - DAY 
As she bounds the stairs, comes to her apartment door and jiggles with the keys, a strange prescient whimpering sound coming from her. As she enters the apartment. 
CAROL Hello? Hello? 
VOICE (O.S.) Mrs. Connelly, I'm in here. 
The worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway, her innards squirting the same chemicals that drives elk on opening day of the hunting season. 
INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - DAY 
CAROL What? Please? Now? Tell me?! 
DR. BETTES Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes. 
CAROL Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he? 
DR. BETTES He's in the bathroom...  He's fine. 
CAROL (overlapping) Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold. 
And so she does. Wow does she... and gives us some notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it takes to subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer enters from the bathroom. All at hyper speed now. Salvation as farce. 
SPENCER (to his mother) Hi... (they kiss) Did you know there are doctors who come to your house? 
CAROL No, I didn't. (to Bettes) So why are you h... 
Beverly, Carol's mother, enters the room. She is ebullient which, if life allowed, would be her natural state. 
BEVERLY I didn't know you had a secret admire. 
CAROL Huh? 
BEVERLY You met the gift. 
SPENCER He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors. 
CAROL (to Spencer) Stay out of this...  Doctor? 
DR. BETTES My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher. (as Carol reacts) She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do? 
CAROL I'm a waitress. 
ON Dr. Bettes' reaction her mother adds a saving grace. 
BEVERLY In Manhattan. 
VOICE (O.S.) Dr. Bettes? 
DR. BETTES In here. 
A NURSE enters. 
NURSE Sorry it took so long. I don't know Brooklyn.

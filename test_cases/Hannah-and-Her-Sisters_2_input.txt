HOLLY Well...you know, uh...I sing a little, I mean... (chuckling self-consciously) 
HANNAH (realizing she's hurt Holly, reacting) Ohh! 
HOLLY (overlapping, shaking her head) You know. 
HANNAH (hanging the blouse back on the rack) I know, no-- (chuckling) I know. 
HOLLY (overlapping, still chuckling self- consciously, gesturing) I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I-- 
HANNAH (interrupting, touching her sister's shoulder) No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that. 
The two sisters walk away from the rack, Hannah slightly in the lead.  Behind them are some more racks of clothing and a large window with closed venetian blinds. 
HOLLY (gesturing) Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song. 
HANNAH (nodding as she looks around the store, pulling up her shoulder bag strap) Uh-huh. 
HOLLY Easily. 
Holly pauses, looking at her sister.  They continue to walk. 
HOLLY (looking at Hannah) W-why?  You don't think it's realistic? 
HANNAH (putting her hand on Holly's shoulder) No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just... (gesturing) hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take... 
HOLLY (overlapping, nodding) Yeah. 
They walk over to a table laid out with colorful scarves and decorated with hurricane lamps bordering its edges. 
HANNAH (continuing, looking at some clothes hanging beneath the table) ...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something? 
HOLLY (overlapping, nodding) Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. (chuckling and gesturing) 
HANNAH (overlapping, looking at the clothes) I hope. 
Holly looks at her sister for a beat. 
HOLLY (sighing) Boy, you really know how to cut me down. 
HANNAH (looking at Holly, reacting) What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything? 
HOLLY (gesturing) Tch, well, I sing! (suddenly shouting) For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing! 
A female customer, who'd come over to the table, browsing through the rack of clothes near Hannah, looks up, reacting. She walks away. 
HANNAH (overlapping, reacting to her sister's outburst) Okay! (looking at her sister) Okay.  I-- What happened?  You know, we were having a really nice time, a-and suddenly, everything went to bad feeling. 
She walks past Holly and briefly looks at a different rack of clothes beneath the table. 
HOLLY (shaking her head) Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why. 
HANNAH (gesturing) Look, everything's going your way. 
She walks offscreen to a nearby rack; the camera remains focused on Holly. 
HOLLY You're right. (pausing) I'm happy. (shrugging, looking at the offscreen Hannah) Why must I let my insecurities spoil everything? 
Holly chuckles and begins to look through the scarves on the table. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THEATER - DAY 
A group of theater executives, including the producer, the director, and two assistants, sit in a cluster in the empty audience, talking; they look up at the offscreen Holly, who is auditioning on the stage.  She is singing "I'm Old- Fashioned," accompanied by a piano. 
HOLLY (offscreen, singing softly) "This year's fancies Are passing fancies..." 
The film moves from the audience to the stage where Holly, her hands clasped in front of her, continues to sing her song.  A large group of other hopefuls are seen in the background behind her. 
HOLLY (continuing her singing, barely moving her body) "But sighing sighs Holding hands This my heart Understands I'm old-fashioned And I don't mind it It's how I want to be As long as you agree To stay old-fashioned with me." 
The camera moves from Holly back to the executives in the audience.  As it passes the empty audience seats, they are heard offscreen. 
PRODUCER (offscreen) Thank you. 
DIRECTOR (offscreen) Thank you. 
PRODUCER (offscreen) It was very nice. 
ASSISTANT #1 (offscreen, overlapping) Terrific. 
The camera has reached the executives in the audience.  They are now chattering among themselves, Holly forgotten. 
STAGE MANAGER (offscreen, overlapping the executives' chatter) April Knox? 
The film cuts back to the stage, where April, handling the audition pianist some sheet music, prepares herself to sing "The Way You Look Tonight." The stage is very black, stark, except for April and the pianist. 
APRIL (singing) "Someday When I'm awfully low When the world is cold I will get a glow Just thinking of you And the way you look Tonight..." 
CUT TO: 
EXT. A STREET OUTSIDE THE THEATER - DAY 
A theater marquee can be seen on the busy street as Holly and April walk down the street towards the camera, moving closer and closer as they talk.  Workmen and various street noises can be heard indistinctly in the background. 
HOLLY I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised. 
APRIL (sighing) Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money. 
HOLLY Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health. 
APRIL Oh, uh, listen, David called me up. 
HOLLY (reacting) What? 
APRIL (gesturing) Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera. (chuckling) I didn't know what to say.

The hall is fifty feet long.  At the far end a few soldiers running through. 
SERGEANT 
Seal off that sector! 
A soldier runs to obey, working the door controls. 
VRIESS 
No! 
The soldier sees him, but the fear on the boy's face telegraphs his- decision. 
Vreiess starts pumping toward the door.  He's strong, picking up speed, but the alien rounds the corner and bolts after him. 
Vriess can't even look back as the thing gains on him.  The door begins to come down, the soldier finishing the sequence and running off. 
Vriess rolls, face set -- the alien a few feet behind, reaching for him 
An EXPLOSION far away ROCKS THE SHIP -- the hall tilted momentarily, Vriess gets a  boost as he rockets downhill, the beast still on him, the door closing, too low for him to clear. He gets there and SLAMS a lever, his chair FLATTENS out to a dolly  position, his head just CLEARS the closing door as the alien SLAMS into it, Vriess spinning out and flying off the chair it tilts, landing in a heap next to him. 
Lying still on the ground, he listens as the beast slams against the door a few more times, then fades off. 
VRIESS 
Fuck everything.... 
He reaches up for the chair and from the back of it he pulls out a shotgun. 
CUT TO: INT.  LIFEBOAT BAY 5 - CONTINUOUS 
Perez is trying to maintain order. He is failing. Grabs a corporal. 
PEREZ 
Muster a squad to search for survivors! 
CORPORAL 
Fuck no! Fuck no! Fuck you! 
Perez slams him to the ground with his fist. 
An ALIEN LEAPS OUT at him from the ceiling. The soldiers scatter, Perez just leaping out of the way -- 
PEREZ 
Shoot it! Fry it! 
A couple of men fire their burners, to little effect. 
One soldier runs up to the action. His head is bloodied, his expression vengefully grim. 
The soldier whips out a pistol, private.issue, he takes a bead on the thing -- 
PEREZ 
NO! 
And the soldier FIRES -- pumps three bullets into the beast sends it flying back toward the window. 
Perez is riveted by the sight of: ANGLE: DROPS OF BLOOD 
big ones, hitting the window. Everything seems to move slowly now - the alien,  struggling as the soldier pumps two more bullets into it, the other soldiers, Perez -- the monster falls and the BLOOD EATS THROUGH THE WINDOW.. 
PEREZ 
Get out!  Everyone!  Now! 
Soldiers are beginning to get it.. The window CRACKS, begins to SHAKE as the blood is almost through it. 
Even the soldier who shot the alien has stopped, his face frozen in horror at what he's about to accomplish. 
Perez shoves him, herds the rest out, looking back -- 
PEREZ 
Clear the sector! 
at the window, the blood is almost through -- 
Men are pouring out of the hall -- some move down a side hall and SLAM the door shut  behind them, but most are making for the main exit anyway. 
FATHER 
Warning.  Potential hullbreach.  Clear sector. 
The blood eats a hole in the window -- the nearest soldier is sucked back against the  window -- he SCREAMS as he is sucked through a hole no bigger than his fist. 
Still men are falling over each other, Perez herding them out. 
A huge CRACKING sound, and Perez shuts his eyes. 
The window explodes outward, the air blowing everything int space. Debris, vehicles, men, all tangled and dead as they blown out into the black. 
ANGLE: THE SECTOR DOORS 
SLAM shut instantly one cutting right through a soldier halfway out. 
ANGLE: AIR VENTS 
Gates slam down here as well. 
ANGLE: ELECTRICAL DUCTS 
Foam SHOOTS into them, hardening instantly, sealing the breached sector. 
FATHER 
Breach contained. Sector five nonfunctional. 
CUT TO: INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS 
As the crew moves quickly through.  They come to a shut door, red lights along it indicating it's locked. 
ELGYN (to DiStephano) 
Open it. 
DISTEPHMO 
I can't. 
Johner puts his gun to the soldier's head. 
WREN 
He can't!  The sector's closed.  The hull's been breached! 
ELGYN 
Okay, which way? 
WREN 
We'll have to go through the holding cells.  Here. 
ELGYN 
All right. 
They turn left, entering

KINGDOM 8/18/06   22. 
32   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - UNKNOWN TIME              32 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI, Saudi Police, 45 years-old, mustache as thick as Sykes'. A firecracker-loud crack makes him flinch. He stands in the back of the room, not participating in the interrogation. Just observing. Clearly not happy about what he's observing. 
His POV: The Officer from the second Land Cruiser that rammed the fake and killed those inside, Sergeant Haytham. slab- cuffed and being worked over hard buy a couple of thick- fisted SAUDIS.. Silent tears roll off his cheek, left ear split ghastly. A MAN standing far right of him beats him: the firecracker sound again. 
Al-Ghazi looks away, biting his tongue. Obviously wants this over. 
In-charge of the interrogation: GENERAL ABDUL MALIK. He doesn't appear sadistic, but very determined to get the truth from Sergeant Haytham by any means necessary. Those distinctions blur easily. Malik gives a `hold-up' signal. The following exchange in Arabic: 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK No falsehoods, Sergeant Haytham. What was your involvement? 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM Killing those I saw responsible. 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK So none could be questioned? 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM (puzzled, angry) I don't understand. 
A nod from General Malik: another vicious crack. 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK You were born and raised in Suweidi- 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM -that is not a crime- 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK -it should be. 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM It's not. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06   23. 
GENERAL ABDUL MALIK Do you know Abu Hamza? 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM I do not. 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK Your brother was killed fighting the Americans. True or false? 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM I am not my brother. 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK Your brother-- 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM I am NOT my brother! 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK TRUE or- 
Al-Ghazi interrupts. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI He has answered the question. 
Malik shoots Al-Ghazi a unequivocal SHUT THE FUCK UP hard eye. Then back on Haytham. 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK We found six more uniforms than you were assigned in your possession -- that is a crime: especially when you consider the Attackers wore our Uniform... 
Another nod, another crack. Al-Ghazi, flinching, becomes more alert. 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM Uniforms? 
General Malik in Haytham's face: 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK Truth! 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM I sweat. I'll say it again because it is true. I need more uniforms because I must change during shifts...look at my shirts. 
KINGDOM 8/18/06     24. 
GENERAL ABDUL-MALIK I am not interested in your sweat. 
SERGEANT HAYTHAM -then look at my jackets. Please. Permanent stains...no matter how many times they're cleaned... 
Colonel Al-Ghazi grimacing now, leaves the room. 
33   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD - STORAGE - NEXT MOMENT            33 
We follow. Al-Ghazi hustling into an evidence storage room. Searching. Finds a Locker labelled `Haytham.' Opens it. Pulls out several shirts still in the plastic dry-cleaning sheaths: yellowed, permanent stains on the armpits of each. 
34   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM        34 
Al-Ghazi walks back into the room with the shirts, lays them down on the table in front of the General -- all business. 
COLONEL AL-GHAZI He's telling the truth. 
The only sound for a long, unsettled moment: Sergeant Haytham's labored breathing. Malik looks at the shirts, then Al-Ghazi, hesitates, steps away. 
GENERAL ADBUL-MALIK You were injured when you used your vehicle to protect your country. Do you understand? 
Al-Ghazi moves in, begins uncuffing Haytham's bloody-raw wrists, hard-eyeing Malik the whole time. These men clearly don't like each other. 
35   EXT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - LATER                     35 
Al-Ghazi and Haytham sit alone. Al-Ghazi smokes. Haytham looks down at his feet.

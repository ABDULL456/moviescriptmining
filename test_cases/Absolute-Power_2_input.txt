Kate. She hesitates, then decides on the front table. She takes a breath. Sits. Motionless.

McCarty as before, with his weapon. He pulls the trigger again and again, there is the "CLICK" -- now he flicks away a grain of dust from the barrel -- 
-- then he puts the weapon down, reaches out and -- 
ONE BULLET. It's supersonic ammo. McCarty picks it up, blows on it gently. He might be holding a child. 
233   INT. CAFE ALONZO BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY                      233 
Burton and Seth.    They can see Kate sitting alone in the late afternoon. 
SETH (mutters) Fuck... 
-- And a goddamn WAITER has appeared and is walking out toward Kate. He is Asian and very young. 
234   EXT. CAFE ALONZO                                             234 
Kate, startled as the Waiter calls out from behind her. 
WAITER Miss? (as she spins around) What you want please? 
His English could be a lot better. 
KATE Nothing, thank you. 
(CONTINUED) 
234   CONTINUED:                                                     234 
WAITER Got to. 
KATE Pardon? 
WAITER (gesturing) You sit you eat please. 
235   INT. CAFE ALONZO BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY                        235 
Seth and Burton.       Stunned. 
SETH This is not part of my brilliant master plan. 
More Tums. 
BURTON Unfuckingbelievable. 
They both crunch away. 
236   INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY                                          236 
McCarty, watching the Waiter and Kate. He's not happy either. He points a finger at the Waiter, goes "Boom." 
237   EXT. CAFE ALONZO - DAY                                         237 
Kate, and it's almost four o'clock and she's not at her best. 
KATE (gesturing around) I'm waiting for someone. 
WAITER He must eat too, please. 
KATE Oh he will, we both will -- we'll order half the menu -- but just not now -- 
The Waiter nods, finally he turns, starts off. 
Kate.   Trembling. 
(CONTINUED) 
237   CONTINUED:                                                      237 
The Waiter returning. 
WAITER Cheesecake gone. 
KATE Thank you so much. 
The Waiter nods again, and this time he does go. 
Kate, watching him, making sure.       Now she sits straight -- 
238   CLOSEUP - KATE                                                  238 
Very shaky, trying to hold it together. And now crosshairs cover her face as we PULL BACK to reveal -- 
239   EXT./INT. UNMARKED VAN ON STREET NEAR CAFE BUILDING -           239 DAY 
Collin. He holds a very high-powered weapon. It looks like it could kill from a thousand yards away. 
Where he is -- and it's not a thousand yards away -- he's in an unmarked van on the street, even closer than McCarty. 
Collin, loading his weapon.       His movements are skilled. His concentration is total. 
240   INT. BROWNSTONE -    DAY                                        240 
McCarty, glancing out at the office building area. The three workmen on the scaffolding are fighting to right the glass panel. One of them grabs a rope connected to a block and tackle. 
He pulls on the rope.      Slowly, the piece begins to rise.

Roy shines his flashlight over the rail. 
ROY There's something in the water! 
Suddenly Roy wheels overboard, yanked into the murky sea. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011           3. 
The Skipper drops the mic and rushes to the rail with Greg. 
SKIPPER Roy! 
Roy's glowing flashlight bobs in the water. 
SKIPPER Can you see him?! 
A hundred yards off on the opposite starboard side, far behind them, Roy surfaces SCREAMING! 
Greg and the Skipper rush to the starboard rail. 
Roy's gurgled, tortured cries mist in the air. 
The Skipper snaps into action.   Seconds count. 
SKIPPER Don't lose him! 
Greg points, fixing Roy's position. 
The Skipper grabs a lifebuoy, lights it up and throws. 
SKIPPER Roy! Don't panic, mate.     Swim for the buoy! 
GREG C'mon, Roy, kick! 
Roy's head strains the surface, his arms flailing in agonised spasms ... 
... And then silence as he goes under.   The sound of water sloshes and laps against the hull. 
The Skipper stares hopelessly at the water.      Greg's pointed hand trembles. He lowers it. 
The Skipper shoves a lifejacket into Greg's chest. 
SKIPPER Put it on. 
GREG What happened? 
SKIPPER Just do it, boy. 
Greg does, fumbling. GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011          4. 
The Skipper loads a flare gun and aims it overhead -- WHOOSH! The glowing red beacon graffities the starry sky. 
COASTGUARD (O.S.) (VIA RADIO) Merry Widow. Merry Widow. This is Coastguard Haven Point. Please respond. Over. 
SKIPPER Radio a mayday! (off Greg's hesitation) Move! 
Greg scrambles back to the helm -- 
INT. PILOTHOUSE / MAIN DECK - INTERCUT 
-- and snatches the radio mic. 
GREG (INTO MIC) Mayday-Mayday-Mayday. (SEARCHES CHART) Merry Widow, uh, echo whiskey niner ait fife. Man overboard. Man overboard. Emergency assistance required. Position -- 
The Skipper scans the glassy sea with a flashlight. 
SKIPPER ROY?!   ROY?! 
Subtly at first, the buoy's bight of rope twinges.    The Skipper sees it. His eyes narrow -- 
-- it jerks like a fishing line.    The Skipper grabs it and reels it in. 
SKIPPER C'mon, Roy, mate. Fight. 
UNDERWATER 
The buoy's rope moves towards the boat. 
INT. PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT 
Suddenly the trawler keels steeply.     Greg grips the fittings for support as debris rains on him. 
GREG Jesus Christ! GRABBERS - Production Draft (GOLD) 28/1/2011             5. 
COASTGUARD (O.S.) Received Mayday, Merry Widow. Emergency rescue team dispatched. How many aboard? Over. 
Water laps over Greg's feet as the boat rights itself.       Greg surveys the flooded deck. The Skipper's gone. 
GREG (INTO MIC) Please hurry.

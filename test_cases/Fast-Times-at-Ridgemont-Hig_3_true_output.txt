EXT. FIELD AND SCOREBOARD 
The half-time gun fires and the score is 36-7... Ridgemont. Even the Ridgemont players steer clear of Charles Jefferson as they return to their locker room. 
EXT. THE HAMILTON POOL - HOT AFTERNOON - SEVERAL WEEKS LATER 
Linda and Stacy are sitting by the pool, dressed in string tie bathing suits. They are listening to the music of Tom Petty's "Breakdown" playing on the living room stereo. Linda luxuriously applies suntan lotion to her chest and legs, in long and writhing strokes. Stacy reads a book. It's called Total Orgasm. Several beats pass. 
LINDA I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here. 
STACY (engrossed in book) You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school. 
LINDA Why don't you put your mother's secret book back? 
Linda continues regally applying lotion. 
STACY Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?' 
LINDA (automatic) Okay, penis, that's one, balls... 
STACY Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category? 
LINDA You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck. 
STACY All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?' 
LINDA Climax together. 
STACY Does that ever happen? 
LINDA No. But it's a nice idea. 
STACY Listen to this ... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.' 
Linda stops applying lotion, considers that thought. 
LINDA Well... they obviously don't know about Doug. 
They laugh. Linda resumes applying the lotion. Stacy continues reading the book. A couple of beats pass. 
STACY How long does Doug take? 
LINDA I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes. 
STACY (pause) What's Doug do in Chicago? 
LINDA He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him. 
Stacy looks at Linda, almost disbelieving. 
LINDA (CONT'D) (wistful) He's no high school boy. 
There is a noise by the side fence leading into the Hamiltons' backyard. It is Mark Ratner and Mike Damone. They are already wearing swimsuits. 
DAMONE Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework! 
STACY Oh, really? 
THE RAT Really. We figured you needed the help. On such a hot day. 
Stacy quickly stashes the book in a stack of towels beside her. She leans over to Linda and speaks confidentially. 
STACY What do you think? 
LINDA I think they're both virgins. 
Stacy smiles, gets up and goes over to the fence. 
STACY I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda? 
LINDA No. 
DAMONE Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi. 
STACY O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay? 
EXT. HAMILTON POOL 
Mike Damone yells "banzai!" and dives into the small pool. At one end of the pool is the jacuzzi, which is separated by a tile wall. Damone has already poured the Wisk into the jacuzzi, and the detergent has created a huge bubble bath effect. Damone surfaces and flips into the jacuzzi. 
Stacy, looking great in a green bikini, sits kicking her legs by the side of the pool. Linda stands on the board. She is poised to dive. The Rat treads water and stares at both girls. Inside the Hamilton living room, the family stereo plays the music of Deep Purple's "Woman From Tokyo". 
DAMONE Hey, Linda! I'll judge your dive. I'm a champion diver myself. 
Brad arrives home by the side gate and slams it behind him. He is home from a bad day at work. He walks out onto the patio and stands with his hands on his hips. For the first time, our former campus hero looks absurd. He is still in his uniform from Captain Kidd Fish and Chips -- it is a blue and white striped Pirates of the Caribbean outfit, complete with black plastic sword at the side, and a ridiculously large Ponce de Leon-esque hat. Brad carries the hat under his arm.

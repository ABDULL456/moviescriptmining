ROHEIM They-jumped me. That bastard Scarpo and his boys. They were waiting on me. Returns to get more clean towels. And comes back. 
HORUS Why didn't you come through the back... standing out there in the dark? 
ROHEIM -Couldn't find my keys. Must've dropped them'in the fight. (feels his lip) Shit... He works himself off the chair. Heads inside the bathroom. 
HORUS What're you doing? 
ROHEIM (into the mirror) the old man Look at what they did.. gave a fat lip to match his big mouth. I'm for shit. 
HORUS 
(FRUSTRATION) Sit down Could you knock it off, please. so I can clean the cuts. He leads the old wretch back to the chair. 
ROHEIM I'm a waste of time... 
HORUS Stop. 
ROHEIM I'm too old for this. 
HORUS You're not old. 
ROHEIM What am I... I'm biologically challenged. Any way you look, I'm a waste of effort. 
(BEAT) 
I Use to be, I blame the job. The job. think, bullshit job. Not right for a man. "To observe and record..." I say, what a t's for the hell is DIo nly dogs. They got a d o o gs in t g g hisn reason we're he d re, we don't shit on the carpet. Horus looks away. Doesn't want to hear it. 
ROHEIM (CONT'D) 
(CONTINUING) But you know what, Horus. That's all wrong. It ain't the job. The job don't make the man. It's me. Not the uniform. It starts right here... 'cause I can't do anything right. Fuck up my ABC's. (a beat; at Horus) But you. Why do you put up with this crap? A wife. A kid. There... waiting for you at home. Horus - he just doesn't know anymore. 
EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT 
On the rooftop of this building - Hancock, on another end of a Marlboro. Eyes red. Hair in wet dishevelment. He's a mess. 
HANCOCK got to do what you got to do. He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other hand. We sense a decision brewing... 
INT. THE LONGFELLOW BEDROOM - NIGHT 
A desk clock points to 2:30 am. Mary - awake undercover. She twists, turns... A shadow engulfs the side of her wall, smothering the light in the room. Mary catches it. Rises above her blanket. What she sees - outside the window, Hancock hanging there in non- gravity. He stares directly at her. 
HANCOCK I know you're up, Mary. I know you can hear me. Please meet me on the boardwalk tomorrow morning. Nine o'clock. It's important that I talk to y ou, then. 
(GRAVELY) Please, Mary. And with that, he's off and away. Mary.- stunned. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY 
We're in the staircase - where Horus is, supporting Roheim up the stairs. 
ROHEIM They're going to can me. 
HORUS No one's canning anyone. No one saw us... watch your step... leave. 
ROHEIM Should be an extra key over the door. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
In the kitchen, Mary and Aaron - the morning routine. Something is off this morning, like someone threw a wrench into the machinery. Mary appears a bit frazzled, handing her son toasts. She rushes back to the stove - her eggs beckoning. 
AARON The toast's burnt. 
MARY What? Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox. 
AARON We're late... you forgot the corn chips. Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down... and all over the place.

"PET SEMATARY II" 
FADE IN: 
INT.  LEMARCHE CASTLE, TOMB - NIGHT (1865) 
A storm is raging outside. We hear the clap and roll of THUNDER. 
TOMB STAIRWAY - 
RATS scurry away down the scum-covered steps as the GLOW OF A LANTERN and FOOTSTEPS herald someone's arrival... 
GENVIEVE LEMARCHE 
emerges around the bend. Mid-30s. Cultured beauty. Her dress and face are smeared with grime and... is that blood we see too? God only knows what's happened to her. 
Genvieve ducks under a monstrous cobweb as she passes an open window. 
WINDOW 
LIGHTNING streaks across the night sky outside. We catch a glimpse of the MOON disappearing behind the clouds. 
Genvieve reaches the bottom of the stairs. The tomb itself. 
Water trickles in through cracks in the lichen-covered walls, pooling on the tomb floor. 
Genvieve moves forward, her lantern throwing distorted shadows over everything... 
In front of her is Anton LeMarche's stone sarcophagus. Genvieve kneels in the water, one hand resting on the spiked iron railing which surrounds the tomb. She reaches the other hand towards a scum-covered plaque, brushing the grime away... 
THUNDER and LIGHTNING reach a crescendo as... 
A SKELETAL HAND rises out of the water, reaching for her. 
Genvieve SCREAMS. The lantern falls from her grasp, sputtering out. The hand reaches for her arm and inadvertently clutches her breast instead... 
Genvieve starts to laugh hysterically. 
DIRECTOR (O.S.) (exasperated) Cut! Thank you, Renee. Can we throw some light on the set? 
GENVIEVE I'm sorry... 
Suddenly it is lighter. Genvieve can't stop laughing. The groping monster hand disappears back beneath the water. 
WE PULL BACK, REVEALING - 
It's not 1865. The LeMarche Castle tomb is in fact, a 90s movie set. We are inside a soundstage, on a raised set, so the slugline should really read... 
INT.  SOUNDSTAGE, LEMARCHE CASTLE TOMB SET - 
A FILM CREW scurries about. Everyone is LAUGHING now. The DIRECTOR sits to the right. He and the DP are already huddled over the video-assist monitor. We see the previous scene rewinding at high- speed. 
The FIRST A.D. moves in. 
FIRST A.D. Water in the pool's running low, fill her up! 
Crewmembers move towards the set. 
An SFX PUPPETEER (i.e., the skeletal arm) crawls out from under, followed by an ELECTRICIAN. 
PUPPETEER I can't see shit down there! I'm working blind! 
GENVIEVE/THE ACTRESS 
rises out of the water. Her name is actually RENEE HALLOW and her beauty is undeniable, even in such a disheveled state. 
RENEE This is great, I could've spent four months on a romantic comedy with Warren Beatty, and instead, I've got a horny zombie trying to cop a feel! 
The crew members LAUGH. She's well-liked on the set. Renee grins. Wardrobe and make-up personnel move in to adjust Renee's appearance. 
RENEE Uhgh, there's water everywhere... (beat) Can I get a cigarette? 
The MAKE-UP GIRL pulls a pack of cigarettes from her fanny-pack and offers Renee one. In a flash, a P.A. appears with a lighter. Renee mumbles "thanks" as she fires up. She squints her eyes, trying to see past the set lights. 
RENEE (calling out) Geoff? (beat) Anybody see my boy?

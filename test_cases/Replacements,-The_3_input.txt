IN STANDS 
Even the hardcore Todd, Rob and Bob can hardly look at the carnage. 
OUTSIDE STANDS 
A contingent of strike players like Eddie 
Martel and Wilson Jones huddle in the parking lot. They are laughing their asses off as they watch on a personal TV. 
ON FIELD 
Cheerleaders are down and screaming in pain. Annabelle is running from girl to girl, doing triage. 
ON BATEMAN 
He's sheepishly standing to one side as trainers come out to assist. 
INT. BLOWUP HELMET 
Jamal and Shane are examining the trip wire. Obviously, they were sabotaged. 
JAMAL Bastards. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And now... uh, the rest of the Washington Redskins. 
The rest of the team walks unceremoniously out of the helmet and onto the field. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FIELD - DAY 
BOOM! The Patriot kicker puts one in the end zone for a touchback. 
The ball is placed on the twenty as Shane and the offense walk out onto the field. 
Shane walks slowly toward the huddle that's forming. 
IN HUDDLE 
Andre and Mickey Lee are arguing. 
ANDRE That's where I stand. 
LEE No it's not. 
ANDRE Come on, man, that's my spot in the huddle. 
ON SHANE 
As he walks, we hear McGinty's voice in Shane's helmet. Yes, they do it by one-way helmet radio so the filtered voice you hear is McGinty, speaking into his headset mike. 
McGINTY (V.O.) All right, son, nice and easy now. Let's run our ten planned plays, get a feel for the land... 
Shane walks into the huddle and chaos. 
ANDRE ... Fat fucking nip! You don't know shit! 
LEE What did you call me?! 
ANDRE You heard me, you tub a rice shit! 
SHANE Hold on, what's the problem here? 
Andre and Lee ignore Shane and start pushing each other. 
LEE I'm gonna kick your black ass... 
ANDRE You ain't kickin' jack shit... 
Now Jamal gets involved as Shane tries to get 
between them. 
JAMAL (to Lee) Don't be messing with my brother... 
SHANE Hey, hold on... 
ON REF 
He's watching the play clock and when it gets to zero he pulls his penalty flag and throws it. 
REF Delay of game!    Five yards! 
IN HUDDLE 
Lee suddenly punches Andre through his face guard. Andre knocks into Shane and spins him around. Jamal then goes to punch Lee, he misses and nails Shane in the back of the helmet. 
Shane goes down hard. 
ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL 
They look confused. 
SUMMERALL ... I don't know. Something seems to be going on in the huddle. It looks like... yes, Shane Falco is on his back. They haven't run a play yet but Falco is down. 
MADDEN This is not a good sign. 
ON FIELD 
Trainers race out to Shane, who is lying face up with the huddle standing over him. 
SHANE (clearing the cobwebs) What happened? Am I hurt already? 
Shane sits up.   Suddenly, he remembers what happened. 
SHANE God damn it! I am the quarterback! I am the only one supposed to talk in the huddle!

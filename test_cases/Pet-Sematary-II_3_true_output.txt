A HUGE EYE joins her reflection in the distorting mirror. Marjorie nearly jumps out of her skin. She spins around... 
MARJORIE Jesus, Geoff! Don't sneak up on me like that! 
...but no one is there. 
THE MAKE-UP MIRROR catches another glimpse. Renee's RED LIPS, magnified tenfold. The lips begin to move... 
RENEE (a whisper) Did you really think you could be like me? 
Renee's fist swings in, SMASHING a panel of the mirror... 
Marjorie raises her hands to protect herself against the flying glass. And as her hands come down, she finds... 
Renee standing before her. Her ghostly form silhouetted by moonlight. Curtains billowing around her. We never fully see her. 
Marjorie's face goes white with fear. 
RENEE Such a young face... but you've got potential... 
Renee grabs a fistful of Marjorie's hair, viciously YANKING her head back... 
RENEE We'll do the eyes first. You always start with the eyes... 
Renee lashes out, SLASHING a mirror shard across the skin beneath Marjorie's right eye. Marjorie SCREAMS. 
INT.  GEOFF'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Geoff awakens at the commotion upstairs. He rocks forward, rising from his bed.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Geoff pauses at the base of the attic stairway, looking up at the open door. All he hears are the faint SOUNDS of movement. 
GEOFF Marjorie? You know you're not supposed to be in the attic. 
Geoff starts up the stairs. 
INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT 
Geoff trepidatiously enters. He weaves through the maze of gauzy curtains. And then he sees her... 
Renee is standing in the midst of the attic. She's perfectly made up. Gorgeous. Just as she was on the day she died. She smiles warmly. 
GEOFF Mom... 
RENEE I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again. 
Renee raises her outstretched arms to receive him. Through the haze of his tears, Geoff doesn't see the sinister, vacant gleam in her eyes. 
INT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT 
Reaching the house, Chase SKIDS to a stop across the lawn.

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT 
Chase cautiously enters with the gun in his grasp. The spring coil swings the CREAKING door shut behind him. 
From Chase's vantage point, he can't see them yet. He makes his way around the stripped dressmaker's model, past an upright dressing mirror. And then he sees... 
MARJORIE 
Slumped against Renee's bed like a ragdoll. We can only see half of her face. It looks untouched. Chase reaches for her... 
CHASE Marjorie? 
Marjorie's head rolls sideways, exposing the other half of her face. The skin has been stripped from her skull and peeled back... 
Chase turns his head away. And that's when he sees them... 
RENEE AND GEOFF 
Holding each other tightly. Geoff has his head buried in Renee's breast. Renee looks up from her son, meeting Chase's gaze. Her voice is both seductive and terrifying. 
RENEE Hello, Chase. 
Chase gasps. The word "horror" doesn't do the moment justice. 
CHASE Oh my God... 
RENEE We can try again, Chase. We can make it work this time. 
Chase sinks back against the wall. He's lost a lot of blood and his strength is leaving him.

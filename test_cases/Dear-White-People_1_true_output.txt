COCO Hey there muffins. How do I look? Why are white folks so obsessed with being Black? And why are Black folks so addicted to Blonde Barbie doll weaves? Honeys it's a strange symbiosis we're here to explore... 
Coco's voice cracks as she stares into her own image on her iPhone. She pauses it and takes a breath. 
80B   HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                        80B 
Lionel leads George through the dense crowd towards the kitchen - George pulls Lionel into a hallway and into... 
80C   BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS                                       80C 
...the bathroom and up against the door. George inhales Lionel's lips. Runs his fingers through Lionel's hair. 
LIONEL Ouch. 
GEORGE Sorry. 
LIONEL It's okay. Can't wait to cut all this off. 
GEORGE Don't you dare. 
George plunges his fingers into Lionel's fro once again. Pulls a touch too hard. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I could eat you like a Hershey's. 
This sets something off in Lionel. 
LIONEL I'll be right back. 
Lionel breaks George's grasp and heads out the bathroom... 
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
...and back out into the party. He's trapped in a nightmare of caricatures and reveling students. Can't breathe. 
EXT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Lionel squeezes his way outside. Something goes off in his head as he starts walking away from the party. 
Just then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some friends. Looks at Lionel then at the house. 
KURT What the hell? 
81   INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - NIGHT                              81 
Lionel paces the halls. His mind churns as he passes the dining hall. Sam and Reggie are engaged in something intense. 
DINING HALL 
SAM For a genius dude you're a fucking idiot. 
REGGIE I did it, we did it for you. 
SAM I didn't ask for it Reggie. I look like I betrayed this house. 
REGGIE Yeah? Well you betrayed me. 
Sam gets up and storms out - brushes past Lionel. 
LIONEL Sam? Can we talk? 
Sam turns back around fiercely. 
82   INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    82 
A turntable is uncovered and rolled out - as a DUDE DRESSED LIKE SERENA WILLIAMS starts up a MYSTIKAL record. 
The crowd starts to get live now. 
Coco continues to make her way through the party - her face visibly perturbed by the time she reaches the kitchen. She continues out back... 
83   EXT. KURT'S BACKYARD - NIGHT                                 83 
...and sits pulling out a cigarette. She sees Annie put on a long straight Black wig and brag to friends... 
ANNIE Hey who am I? "Bitch it's weave. Noun. Present tense ho!" 
Right in the gut. She's playing Coco. Coco grabs her phone... 
84   INT. KURT'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                               84

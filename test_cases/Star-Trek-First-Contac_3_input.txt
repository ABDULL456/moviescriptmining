RUBY "Money." So you can get dome money... 
PICARD I can try. 
RUBY You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet? 
Picard hesitates, smiles at her, tries to laugh it off. 
PICARD No... but sometimes I feel that way. (beat) What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs. 
RUBY Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer. (beat) Who are you? And how do you know Zephram? 
PICARD I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in -- 
RUBY (cuts him off) 'Fraid not. 
Ruby walks past him with the X-ray... 
106   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                        106 
Picard follows Ruby out into the corridor. She has a satisfied smile on her face -- it's not easy to put one over on this woman. And the truth is, she's enjoying Picard's frustration. As they walk along... 
PICARD What? 
RUBY (casual) You're lying. 
PICARD What makes you say that? 
RUBY You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me. 
PICARD Are you always sucha good judge of character? 
She stops, turns, looks at him. 
RUBY Always. 
Ruby turns and walks off. Picard follows her, doggedly determined to get those photos... 
107   INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT                     107 
Beverly is holding the X-ray glass Ruby made up to the light, as the Doctor seen earlier looks on. 
BEVERLY The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones... 
DOCTOR I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage. 
As Beverly and the Doctor examine the X-ray, we MOVE TO Ruby, who's looking down at Cochrane. He's still in bed and on a respirator. She smoothes his hair with affection. Picard stands on the other side of the bed, watching her. 
PICARD Were the two of you... involved? 
RUBY No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be. 
PICARD (surprised) How did you know about that? 
Ruby looks at him with a smile. 
RUBY I didn't. 
Her smile widens, and then she leaves the bed to join the Doctor and Beverly. Picard shakes his head and smiles after her -- chagrinned and amused at the same time. 
RUBY (to Doctor) We can't take any more X-rays until I can mix up a new batch of the silver halide. 
DOCTOR Can you do it tonight? We may have to operate. 
RUBY Sure. It'll be ready by morning. 
Ruby turns and heads for the door. Picard moves after her. 
PICARD Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important. 
RUBY I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow. 
PICARD It can't wait until tomorrow... 
RUBY Too bad. (beat) Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies. 
She flashes him that smile again, then darts out the door. Picard is left frustrated -- he knows that he can't let it go at that... 
CUT TO: 
108   INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING                              108 
Worf and a team of TEN SECURITY GUARDS are preparing for battle. They're setting up large, heavy-duty phaser equivalents of machine guns --  big, mean-looking weapons on tripods. There are two of these weapons aimed at each entrance to Engineering. The Security Officers are strapping on body armor, checking weapons, building makeshift barricades over each of the doors. 
Worf is in command, directing the action.

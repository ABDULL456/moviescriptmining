BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES FADE IN: 
1      EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT                             1 MOVING IN FAST MOTION -- a kaleidoscopic jewel box -- glittering, shining and speeding PAST our eyes. 
2      ANGLE                                                      2 MOVING south TO north FROM the Battery and the World Trade Center, streets and buildings FLIPPING PAST like black diamonds spilling INTO our peripheral vision and DISAPPEARING as we SPEED uptown TOWARD... 3      FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT                                       3 
Cars and people caught in the same frantic ballet of shining lights as we RACE UP the avenue, and the voice of Peter Fallow speaks to us... PETER (V.O.) Yes. We're getting closer. Can you feel it. Can you see it? The heat. The brilliance. Moving fast into the heart of it. Buzz. Buzz. Can you feel the buzz? The city is pulling you in. The city of light. The city of diabolical promise. The city of answered prayers. 4      OMITTED                                                    4 thru                                                              thru A11A   EXT.

pulls up to the World Financial Center and drives into the lower garage. A11B   INT. LOADING AREA - LIMOUSINE - NIGHT                      A11B 
pulls up. A male and female aide -- both carrying walkie-talkies -- rush to open the door. They pry PETER FALLOW from the back seat. He is wearing a tuxedo and dark glasses. He is very drunk, disheveled and cheerful beyond his means. CONTINUE IN ONE SHOT as... TWO AIDES 
try to lead Fallow into the building. Fallow is clutch- ing a whiskey decanter and a seltzer bottle. He leans heavily on the aides, stumbles and can barely stay on his feet.

approaches. The aides flag it down and throw Fallow onto the cart. The cart carries him past the garbage con- tainer into a long tunnel-like corridor. 
FALLOW 
sways on the cart, trying to mix a drink for himself -- he pulls a glass out of one pocket and some ice cubes out of another pocket. But he is physically incompetent. 
FEMALE AIDE jumps onto the cart and tries to hold him up.   The male aide runs alongside the cart. 
VARIOUS WAITERS in black tie carry covered silver trays as they trot through the tunnel. VARIOUS BUSBOYS 
come running in the other way, pushing carts filled with dirty dishes and glasses. CART 
comes to the end of the tunnel and jerks to a halt. Fallow loses his balance and sprays the female aide with soda water. MALE AIDE pulls Fallow off the cart and continues to lead him through a dark, red-lit area. Several security guards run to meet them. The guards and the aide now escort Fallow through the area. A FEW PHOTOGRAPHERS 
pop out of nowhere, trying to get a picture. The guards push them away and lead Fallow into a lighted corridor. 
FOREIGN DIPLOMAT 
and his wife and daughter join the entourage as they head for an elevator. The diplomat offers Fallow a pen and a book to autograph.

STAN No.   I'll get out. 
They each get out. 
EXT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS 
Zoe and Stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the POURING RAIN. Zoe crosses her arms. 
ZOE Now what? 
STAN I don't know. You tell me. 
That question is answered by the cabbie, who now peels out. 
ZOE What? Where's he going?! (waving her hands, then) Come back! 
They both stand there with a taxi's width between them. 
ZOE (CONT'D) Well, that was stupid. Why'd you get out, you, stupid-head? 
STAN You said you were in a great mood and I was ruining it. I felt bad. (then) Did you just call me stupid-head? 
Zoe storms off with her little steps. 
INT. 68TH STREET SUBWAY STATION - DAY 
Stan and Zoe each swipe their Metrocards at the same time. 
They enter the subway platform which is jam packed with all the other NEW YORKERS who are shit-out-of-luck in the cab department. Rain droplets drip from the ceiling above. 
ZOE Oh, man... 
STAN How's your great mood now? 
INT. 6 TRAIN - DAY 
A packed subway car. Zoe and Stan are back-to-back, pushed together by the crowd. Zoe tries to read her paper. 
STAN How `bout now? 
ZOE Please stop talking to me. 
INT. UNION SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - DAY 
Zoe and Stan walk up the stairs a few feet apart from each other. Zoe does her best to ignore the obvious. 
STAN So, why are you in such a good mood anyway? 
They reach the top of the stairs. The rain has stopped, and the sun is just starting to peek through. Everything is wet and has a magical quality. 
ZOE Not that it's any of your business, but...good things are happening to me. 
Stan is moved by this.   What a thing to say. 
STAN That's nice. I hope it continues. 
ZOE Thanks. Well, have a nice life. Try not to steal any more cabs. 
STAN You do the same. 
They nod and separate. 
INT. HUDSON PETS - DAY 
Hudson Pets is a small but quaint West Village pet store filled with dogs, cats and a few rabbits. 
Zoe enters. Her dog, NUTS, a raggedy, pug-like dog with hind legs in a WHEELCHAIR, bounds/wheels towards her, barking. 
ZOE Hey, Nutsy. How's it going? 
She gives Nuts a good scratch. JALISA, mid-30s, Latina hottie, and Bobby run from the back. 
BOBBY Oh, my God, you're glowing. (to Jalisa) She's glowing, right? 
JALISA Glowing.   Tell us everything. 
BOBBY Everything. 
ZOE There's not much to tell. 
BOBBY You just got shot up with a wad of red-headed-freckle sperm. There's something to tell. 
JALISA He had red hair and freckles?

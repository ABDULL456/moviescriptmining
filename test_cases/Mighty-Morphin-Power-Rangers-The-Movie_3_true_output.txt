From the sky, the six new ANIMAL ZORDS BURST FORTH LIKE THUNDERING, MECHANICAL GODS.  The Rangers look up at the TOWERING ASSAULT VEHICLES in awe. 
81   INT.   COCKPITS                                             81 
We see VARIOUS SHOTS of the Rangers DROPPING INTO their respective cockpits. 
81A   EXT.  MONORAIL STATION - NIGHT   (OLD SC 69)               81A 
Fred, Bulk and Skull watch a sleek monorail pulling in.  Skull talks with a mouth full of pizza. 
SKULL Look, kid, I don't think you realize who you're dealing with. 
FRED I don't think he realizes who HE'S dealing with. 
The train glides to a complete stop and the doors SLIDE OPEN . 
FRED EVERYBODY ON BOARD! 
The youngsters pile through the doors, quickly filling up the entire monorail. 
81B   EXT.  CITY STREET                                          81B 
The parents round a corner, advance down the street like machines. 
82    EXT.   THE ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES                         82 
ATTACK WITH A RELENTLESS FEROCITY.  There's all kinds of CRASHING and BASHING and EXPLOSIONS! 
There's a BLAM, BLAM, BLAM as Scorpitron REPEATEDLY FIRES his cannon arm at the Bear Zord, who in turn DEFLECTS THE VOLLEYS. 
Hornitor shoots a BLAST from it's stinger, the Crane Zord dodges the FIERY ERUPTION. 
KIMBERLY (V. O.) Nice try,  Pinhead! 
Scorpitron repeatedly KICKS at the Frog Zord with it's BLADED FEET, SENDING UP OSCILLATORY DISCHARGES, at the same time SLASHING WITH IT'S LETHAL CLAWS. 
ADAM  (V. O.) Somebody back me up, here! 
Hornitor BORES IT'S DRILL ARM INTO THE APE ZORD, SENDING EXPLOSIONS OF SPARKS. 
ROCKY  (V. O.) These things are FEROCIOUS! 
The Bear Zord CHARGES HORNITOR and the two Mastodons go CRASHING BACKWARD. 
AISHA  (V.O.) The bear kicks butt! 
Hornitor SEARS the Wolf Zord with it's needle-nose.  In retaliation, the Wolf Zord POUNCES, KNOCKING HORNITOR INTO THE STREET.  Now the Falcon Zord SWOOPS THROUGH THE AIR. 
TOMMY  (V.O.) Heads up! 
He FIRES BOOSTER ROCKETS, STRAFING SCORPITRON WITH AN INTENSE FUSILLADE. 
Hornitor gets back up -- the Ape Zord SWINGS DOWN FROM BILLBOARD, RAMS HIM FEET FIRST, SENDS HIM CATAPULTING BACK. 
ROCKY  (V.O.) Hope you've got a good mechanic. 
Scorpitron FIRES A VOLLEY at the Frog Zord -- the Zord BOUNDS THROUGH THE AIR, AVOIDING THE BLAST, COMES CRASHING DOW ON TOP OF SCORPITRON. 
The Falcon Zord swoops in and blasts Scorpitron who BLOWS UP INTO A BILLION FLAMING PARTICLES! 
KIMBERLY (V.O.) WE GOT HIM!! 
IVAN (outraged) These brats are ruining EVERYTHING!

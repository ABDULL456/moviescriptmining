INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3 
They are stunned to hear his voice. Peters answers: 
PETERS Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it. 
STARCK Keep him talking. 
PETERS Do you know what it was? 
JUSTIN (muffled) It gets inside you. It shows you things... horrible things... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3 
JUSTIN ...can't describe it... there are no words... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE 
Weir sits alone, listening to the VOICES on the intercom. 
PETERS (O.S.) (intercom) What, Justin, what shows you? 
JUSTIN (O.S.) (intercom) It won't stop, it goes on and on and on... 
PETERS (O.S.) (intercom) What does? 
JUSTIN (O.S.) (intercom) The dark inside me. 
A LOW MOAN escapes Weir's lips. He cradles his head in his hands. 
EXT. EVENT HORIZON - (MILLER'S CROSSING) 
Miller races across the surface of the Event Horizon, the only sounds, his LABOURED BREATHING, and Justin's tortured VOICE, patched through on his radio: 
JUSTIN (O.S.) (radio) ...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left. 
PETERS (O.S.) (radio) "The dark inside..."? I don't understand. 
JUSTIN (O.S.) (radio) From the Other Place... 
BACK TO: 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3 
JUSTIN The other crew, they're there, they're waiting for me. They're waiting for you. I won't go back there... I won't... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3 
Peters presses her face against the Airlock window, trying to calm him: 
PETERS Justin, look at me. Look at me. Open this door. 
DJ runs up with his medkit. 
STARCK I don't think she can talk him down. We need a sedative. 
DJ If he opens the outer door he'll turn inside-out. 
Starck's hands fly as she re-wires the circuits. Sweat beads her face. 
STARCK Almost got it. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3 
PETERS (O.S.) (muffled) Come on, Baby-bear, open this door... 
Justin looks at her with dead eyes. He reaches out to gently touch the glass between them. 
JUSTIN If you could see the things I've seen, you wouldn't try to stop me. You'd come with me. 
Justin's hand moves to the OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR control. Hesitates... then floats to the OUTER AIRLOCK control. Hits it. 
PETERS (muffled) NOOO! 
A yellow warning light flashes. A warning klaxon WHOOPS, deafening. 
Justin jerks his hands to his ears, closes his eyes... 
COMPUTER Stand-by for decompression. Thirty seconds... 
Justin opens his eyes as if waking from a dream... 
JUSTIN Hey, Mama-Bear... what are doing...? 
And then he realizes where he is...and what is about to happen. 
JUSTIN Oh my god OH MY GOD... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3 
PETERS Starck! 
STARCK I can't! The inner door can't open once the outer door has been triggered, it would decompress the entire ship! 
JUSTIN (muffled) You gotta open, you gotta stop it, please... 
PETERS We have to do something, oh God... 
STARCK (into radio) Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...

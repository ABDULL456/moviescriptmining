PRECIOUS Now? 
MARY No stupid. Got to be there at 7 in the A.M. if you gonna talk to anybody... 
Precious shakes her head, huffs and turns on the stove. Mary then presses the mute button on the remote and whirls around with a cold cigarette between her fingers. 
MARY -Oh you too good for that? Is that what you is now, too good for welfare? (beat)

And while we at it, let's take out son-in-laws, country clubs, white motherfuckers and then call it a day.

MARY Now hurry yo ass up. I'm gon die of starvation over here. Then where you be at then?

A picturesque plate of pork chops and mashed potatoes. 
Precious delivers it to the couch with a fork and knife. 
THE APARTMENT HAS TRANSFORMED INTO THE PRISTINE WORLD OF THE TV SITCOM THEY WERE WATCHING. Precious and Mary are well- dressed and done-up like TV stars. 
MARY What you gon' have? 
PRECIOUS I ain' hungry. I ...

Precious starts eating slowly. Mary lights her cigarette. 
MARY ...Best feed like a pig and not a cow so's you can git yo ass back to the stove. If I croak off starvation, where in the world you be at then? 
Precious eats reluctantly. 
CUT TO: 
56   INT. KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT                                   56 
Pots and pans sit drying on the counter. 
Precious wipes her hands on a dishcloth. 
The room is quiet and empty now. 
Precious stares blankly out of the window. 
...She goes to the television, presses the remote and sits down. "THE COSBYS" is still on. Tired and full, she turns the TV off. She watches Mary's face snoring rhythmically but with extremely unpleasant noises. Finally, she backs away and goes to her bedroom. 
57   INT. PRECIOUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT                                 57 
Precious falls back across her bed with her arms spread. 
She stares up at the crack in her ceiling... 
A hand darts into frame, touches Precious' side and then quickly withdraws. Precious ignores it. The hand returns for another jab. Precious restrains a grin. Finally the hand tickles her fiercely.

57   CONTINUED:                                                57 She giggles uncontrollably. The hand belongs to Tom Cruise. He wears a leather jacket with a cherry red motorcycle helmet tucked under one arm. The helmet has a golden bow stuck on its crown. 
...Precious chases him out of frame for some revenge tickling as they both laugh quietly. 
...The helmet falls to the floor with a bounce. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) ...Claireece, would you like to talk about your home life? 
58   INT. CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY                    58 
Precious sits on a small couch in a modest office containing 2 bookshelves, several plaques and 2 file cabinets. 
MS. WEISS -40's, CAUCASIAN, CONSERVATIVELY DRESSED sits across from Precious with a clipboard on her lap and glasses low on her nose. A strap hangs down from the glasses and snakes around the back of her neck.

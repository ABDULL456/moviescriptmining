INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
MARION is dressed in a suit, preparing to leave. She throws her nightgown into a laundry basket. JACK is asleep. She bends to kiss him. He wakes. 
MARION When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep. 
JACK (dreamily) I'll see you in my dreams. 
INT. SITTING ROOM - DAY 
MARION drops a set of keys into her bag, glances at JACK'S covered computer. She draws the curtain back. Daylight illuminates the old etching of Cape Town. 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
JANI DE VILLIERS is 30-something, blonde, tanned, expensively dressed in designer clothes. She gives JACK ten £50 notes. 
JANI In 20s, please... 
He slots the cash into the "bank" beneath the table, then counts out £500 in £20 chips. He slides the chips towards her, looks at her. She smiles. 
There are ten other PEOPLE at the roulette table. An ARABIC- LOOKING MAN with a moustache behind JANI is looking down the front of her dress. 
JACK (frowns) Place your bets. 
Around the table the PUNTERS move their chips onto numbers, lines, colours. JANI throws three chips to JACK and calls the numbers: 
JANI 
JACK places them for her. 
JACK'S VOICE Jack could see this woman was an experienced gambler. Professionals always place their bets through the croupier. That way there are no comebacks. 
The wheel spins, 11 is the number. JACK calls the number and puts the 'dolly' on 11. JANI smiles faintly. JACK pays out across the table. JANI leaves two chips on 11 The MAN behind JANI puts his chips on 11.  JANI glances up at him. She sees the MAN is betting with her. JACK spins the wheel again. 33 comes up. 
INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT 
JANI bets again on number 11. The MAN follows suit. The wheel spins. JACK watches the table. JANI glances at him. The MAN moves closer to the table to one side of JANI. Concealed in his hand is a chip. As the ball bounces round and lands again on number 11, the MAN deftly adds the chip to the square. JACK clocks it. 
JACK I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet. 
MAN (in Arabic accent) What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady. 
JACK (carefully) You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet. 
MAN I put them on together. 
JACK I'm afraid that's not so, sir. 
REYNOLDS, who has been watching the tables, sees the beginning of an incident. He comes over. The MAN is getting angry. JANI watches. 
MAN Now look here, you... 
REYNOLDS Is there a problem, sir? 
MAN Yes. This croupier is accusing me of cheating. 
JACK It was a late bet. This gentleman has been following the lady's numbers and... 
The MAN interrupts JACK and touches JANI's arm. 
MAN (to Jani) Do you think I cheated? 
JACK and REYNOLDS wait. JACK glances at JANI. 
JANI In my opinion... it was a late bet. 
REYNOLDS I think we should talk about this, sir. Away from the table. 
MAN (angrily) No. I won. I want to be paid. 
He bangs his fist on the felt. JACK waits for REYNOLDS'S decision. REYNOLDS looks at JACK. 
REYNOLDS Pay the gentleman. In full.

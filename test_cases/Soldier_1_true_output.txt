MEKUM watches TODD climb, then looks at CHURCH who is looking at him expectantly. 
MEKUM grins at CHURCH. 
Then MEKUM looks back at TODD, not hurrying. 
TODD is thirty feet up and climbing, passing the eight inch circular "platforms" or footholds in the chain every ten feet. MEKUM (sharply) Melton, on the double!  Up a chain! 
MELTON (saluting) Sir! 
MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD. 
CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters. 
Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks. 
CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him. 
ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS 
Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently. 
His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away. 
Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all... 
LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP 
CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM. 
CHURCH What about...spirit? 
MEKUM (as in "what's that?") Spirit? (...a grin) Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"? 
CHURCH Whatever the latest jargon is. 
MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's all aggression. 
SLOAN (dryly) Real men! 
CHURCH (sharply, to Sloan) At ease, Lieutenant. (turning to Mekum, serious) What if they fought? 
A sudden silence. 
SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look. 
Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there? 
CHURCH (to Rubrick) Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No! 
They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight? 
CHURCH "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up. 
Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance. 
MEKUM Go ahead. 
RUBRICK shrugs, turns to the VETERANS still sitting stoically in a group on the cement floor. 
RUBRICK Romero, A. -- Goines, D.L. -- up the chains. 
Two of the veterans, ROMERO and GOINES, leap immediately to their feet and climb rapidly. 
SLOAN, CHURCH, and RUBRICK exchange a look as MEKUM smirks confidently. 
ANGLE ON TODD AND MELTON ABOVE.  They're still facing each other across the sixty foot drop. 
MELTON glances down...without losing sight of TODD. 
ROMERO and GOINES are coming up the chains fast, hand over hand. They're within ten feet, their impassive faces look dangerous. 
Nothing shows on MELTON's machine-face, but he starts a slight motion in his chain so that he spins slowly.  That way, as the veterans surround him, he keeps a continual eye an all three. 
TODD, his face impassive, eyes MELTON vigilantly. 
ANGLE ON RUBRICK BELOW 
For a long moment, RUBRICK looks up at the three men dangling around the new soldier, then he shouts loudly at them. RUBRICK Get him, men! 
ANGLE ON TODD as SMASH!  TODD is hit hard in the face even as he starts to swing.  WHAM!  MELTON hits him again and TODD loses his grip on the chain, starts to fall, grabs at the chain, clutches, slides... 
ANGLE ON MELTON, CRUNCH!, hit as he swings at MELTON.  WHAM! MELTON hits him again, hard. 
GOINES swings against MELTON from behind, smashing at him with his free hand and with both feet. 
MELTON ignores the blows from behind as he grabs ROMERO by the face with one hand, yanks the face close to his own, and squeezes mercilessly. 
ANGLE ON TODD, TWENTY FEET BELOW.  He's managed to get a foothold on one of the mini-platforms.  His face horribly bloody, he looks up at the action twenty feet above him and sees MELTON suddenly hurl ROMERO downward. 
ROMERO rockets down past TODD... 
ANGLE ON THE FLOOR as SMASH!  ROMERO's body crunches against the cement not far from RUBRICK, SLOAN, and CHURCH, splattering them with blood. 
Their eyes are wide with disbelief and horror as they look up again... 
ANGLE ON MELTON in the girders as he turns to face the man who's been clubbing him from behind...GOINES! GOINES swings his chain wide and MELTON, eyes merciless, deadly, swings after him. 
ANGLE ON TODD, bloody, struggling up the chain hand over hand. His eyes follow MELTON above as the new soldier swings and swings, trying to get a blow at GOINES. 
Just then, GOINES lunges at MELTON, SMACK, SMASH, he hits him hard, and WHAM!  MELTON hits him back... 
ANGLE ON TODD who has climbed to a "platform" foothold on his chain five feet above the swinging fighters.  TODD looks down on MELTON's back as the big man swings close, watching, tensing, then... 
TODD dives off his chain and lands on MELTON's back, crooking one arm around the new soldier's neck and pounding him with one free hand and strangling him with the other arm.

FILBY I don't think I can. 
GROUP SHOT                                             414 
A still unimpressed Hillyer slams his hands on the table, stands up, looks around and then down to Kemp. 
DR. HILLYER Are you coming, Kemp. 
Rising hesitantly, Kemp turns to the Time Traveller. 
KEMP It's getting late and you look exhausted.  You had better get some rest. 
Everyone gets up, Bridewell with difficulty, and starts to leave. 
COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)                415 
The snow falls softly, big flakes wobbling down from the sky.  The front door opens letting out the four guests wearing hats, capes and overcoats. They walk toward a waiting carriage, Kemp helping the staggering Bridewell.  Filby is the last to leave.  He pauses at the step of the carriage looking back to the Time Traveller who stands motionless in the doorway. 
FILBY Goodnight, George. 
AT THE ENTRANCE                                        416 
The Time Traveller lifts his hand and waves. 
TIME TRAVELLER Thank you, David, for being such a good friend - always. 
With this he turns and goes into the house, closing the door slowly. 
AT THE CARRIAGE                                        417 
Those inside are waiting for Filby to get in, but he, deep in thought, still stands gazing back. Kemp thrusts his head from the window. 
KEMP What do you think, Filby? 
FILBY (after a pause) One thing is certain.  Those flowers couldn't have possibly bloomed in the winter-time. 
HILLYER (in the b.g.) You don't really think that story was true? 
Filby reaches a decision. 
FILBY Look, you chaps go on.  It's just a short walk home for me. 
HILLYER (o.s.) Go on, driver! 
The WHIP CRACKS. 
THE DRIVEWAY                                           418 
As the carriage rolls off leaving Filby standing in the falling snow.  He waits until the carriage disappears, then retraces his steps to the front door and raps on it.  He pauses a moment, then uses the heavy knocker.  There is still no answer. He steps back and looks off toward the: 
EXT. LABORATORY WING - FILBY'S P.O.V.                  419 
No light shines through its windows. 
BACK TO FILBY                                          420 
He raps once more, and getting no reply tries the door.  It is unlocked.  He steps into the house. 
INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               421 
The coals still glow in the grate as Filby enters the fully lit room, looking for his friend. Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES ONCE.  Filby turns, goes toward it and stops at the doorway. 
DINING ROOM - FILBY'S P.O.V.                           422 
The table is cleared, candles extinguished.  The pendulum clock is TICKING lazily.  The time is 
FILBY - PANSHOT                                        423 
He calls into the darkness.

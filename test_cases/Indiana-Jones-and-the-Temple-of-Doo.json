{"test1_input": "SHORT ROUND You come to America with me, and we can get job in the circus -- you like that? \nThe baby elephant trumpets affirmitively. \nA ways off, Willie stands wrapped in a blanket watching Shorty and the elephant as she dries her hair by a campfire.  Now Indy comes up and drops an armload of wood for yet another fire. \nWILLIE Where'd you find your little body- guard? \nINDIANA I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket. \nIndiana kneels and arranges the wood. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai.  He was living on the streets. \nWILLIE (smiling) He'll be okay.  He's a good kid. \nIndy strikes a match and lights the new fire. \nWILLIE (Cont'd) All these fires -- you expecting more snakes, Dr. Jones? \nShe smiles snidely and continues drying her hair. \nINDIANA By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai? \nWILLIE Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that \"a girl could go places in the Orient...\" So, look where I got. \nIndy picks up a blanket and spreads it on the ground. \nINDIANA What about the future? \nWILLIE Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, in- credibly rich prince. \nIndy lies down on the blanket. \nINDIANA I'd like to find one of those myself. \nWILLIE (raising an eyebrow) Oh really? \nINDIANA Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years. (smiling) Fortune and glory... \nWILLIE Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones? \nINDIANA Maybe... \nIndy reaches into his pocket and removes the old piece of cloth. \nWILLIE What's that? \nShe walks over to where he's lying down and sits on a boulder. He hands her the cloth and she looks at it by the firelight. \nINDIANA Something that kid gave me last night.  It's a piece of an old manuscript. \nWillie sees a crude drawing in reds, blue and gold. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago. \nWILLIE What does the writing say? \nINDIANA It's Sanskrit.  It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva. \nWILLIE (examining it) That's Shiva?  What's he giving the Priest? \nINDIANA Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil.  To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers. \nWILLIE (looking at Indy) You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village? \nIndy looks at her meaningfully. \nINDIANA It could be. \nWillie seems frightened.  She hands him the piece of cloth and stands up. \nWILLIE (quietly) Fortune and glory...sweet dreams, Dr. Jones. \nShe picks up a blanket and starts off. \nINDIANA I think you should sleep closer. (seeing her sus- picious look) I meant for safety. \nWILLIE (smiling) I'd be safer sleeping with that snake. \nShe steps over to a tree by the fire where her clothes are dry- ing.  Indy watches her pull her dried clothes from the lower branches. \nShe reaches up to remove another piece of her clothing -- it's stuck to the tree and she looks up and yanks it.  Suddenly the piece of clothing moves! \nTwo enormous winds open and the hideous face of a GIANT BAT screeches and hisses at Willie!  She screams hysterically as the bat flaps against her, biting and scratching at her before it fi- nally takes off. \nThe bat flies off into the darkness and Indy chuckles as he watches Willie shanking as she backs slowly toward the fire -- \nWILLIE Did you see it?!  It was one of those bats! (staring into the darkness) God, what else is out there...?! \nShe quickly picks up her blanket and lays it out very close to Indy. \nINDIANA Couldn't keep away, huh? \n", "test1_true": "Indiana watches her lie down and wrap herself in her blanket. then he rolls over and tips his hat down over his eyes to get some well-deserved shut-eye. \nIn a moment, however, we see something grotesque and snake-like slide into frame and move towards Indy -- finally, we realize it's an elephant's trunk.  The trunk nudges Indy's shoulder. \nINDIANA (without looking) Still scared?  Okay, Willie, you can get closer if you want... \nThe elephant's trunk moves closer and nuzzles Indy's neck. \nINDIANA Honey, I knew you'd be the first one to give in... \nNow, we see that Short Round is guiding the baby elephant's trunk with a prod.  Willie watches, stifling a laugh as the elephant's trunk sniffs Indiana's ear -- \nINDIANA (Cont'd) You're going to start something I'm going to have to finish. (moaning) Okay, doll, you asked for it. \nIndiana rolls over, lifts his hat and hollers!  He nearly jumps out of his pants as he stares into the elephant's trunk.  Willie and Short Round dissolve into laughter. \nCUT TO: \n54.    EXT.  THE JUNGLE - DAY                                         54. \nTall, vine-covered trees sway in the wind.  Beneath them, the el- ephants plough through the dense tropical forest.  The sounds of the teeming jungle multiply as Short Round surveys the distant hills. \nSHORT ROUND Indy, look! \nINDIANA That's it.  Pankot Palace. \nWillie looks off at the resplendent while Moghul-style palace ri- sing in the distance above the jungle. \nCUT TO: \n55.    EXT.  A JUNGLE CLEARING - LATER                                55. \nTheir Mayapore guide walks toward the camera and suddenly looks frightened.  He barks commands and the elephants stop.  Indiana jumps down an joins the fearful guide. \nThey stare at a small statue of a malevolent goddess with eight arms.  Around the goddess's neck, a carved necklace displays small human heads -- her eight hands hold other heads by their hair. \nIndiana moves closer to the statue as the terrified guide backs away.  Indy is fascinated by the ritual objects adorning it: leaves, dead birds, rodents and turtles.  Indiana grimaces as he lifts a necklace of real pierced human fingers... \nWILLIE (O.S.) Why are we stopping here? \nIndiana goes back and joins the scared, jabbering guide who is helping Willie down from the elephant.  Short Round jumps down. \nSHORT ROUND What you look at, Indy? \nINDIANA Just a statue. \nWILLIE What's the guide talking about? He hasn't said a word the whole trip. \nIndy listens to the agitated guide and then speaks a few words in Hindi back to him.  They watch the distressed guide trun the ele- phants and start away with them as fast as possible. \nWILLIE He's afraid of something. \nINDIANA He said he couldn't take us any farther.  He has to go sell the elephants. \nWILLIE You mean we have to walk the rest of the way? \nWillie moans and follows Indy.  Short Round watches the elephants trudging away.  The little elephant turns and looks back.  Short Round quickly wipes a tear from his face. \nCUT TO: \n56.    EXT.  A PALACE APPROACH - AFTERNOON                            56. \nIndiana and Short Round hike up a rock-paved road beside a high wall.  Exhausted, carrying her high heels, Willie trudges along behind them. \nWILLIE -- shot at, fallen out of a plane, nearly drowned, squashed by a snake, attacked by a bat -- I smell like an elephant! (yelling) I tell you I'm not going to make it! \nIndiana finally stops.  He walks back to Willie, suddenly picks her us in his arms and starts carrying her the remaining way. Willie is surprised and puzzled. \nINDIANA Any more complaints? \nWILLIE (smiling faintly) Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner... \nShe doesn't seem to mind being carried by Indy.  He arrives at the entrance to the palace and puts her down -- she stands close to him and he gently smoothes the collar of her dress. \nINDIANA It doesn't feel like there's been any permanent damage. \nShe smiles at him again and then turns around -- and whistles as she sees Pankot Palace:  a sprawling, monumental mixture of Mo- ghul and Rajput styles, the palace is an extravaganza of Princely architecture. \n57.    EXT.  A BRIDGE                                                 57. \nThe three travelers start across a marble bridge toward the main entrance.  Lined along the bridge, palace guards stand with lances. \nAs the threesome passes, the first Rajput guard snaps noisily to attention and Willie jumps.  As Willie continues across the bridge, the other guards snap to attention in sequence and she grins, enjoying the attention. \n58.    INT.  THE OUTER COURTYARD                                      58. \nShort Round and Willie follow Indiana through a dark archway into a glittering courtyard.  The palace seems deserted and forebod- ing. \nINDIANA Hello?...(hello?)...(hello?) \nIndy's voice echoes off the marble facades -- three enormous Raj- put guards with curved swords in their sashes appear silently at opposite sides of the courtyard. \nWILLIE (frightened) Hi...(hi)...(hi)... \n", "test1_id": 1851, "test2_input": "NAINSUKH They will make me drink blood of Kali.  Then I fall into black sleep of Kali Ma... \nINDIANA What is that? \nNAINSUKH I become like them.  I be  alive -- nut like in nightmare.  You drink the blood, you not wake up from nightmare of Kali Ma. \nThere's a noise and they see two guards and a priest outside the cell.  Nainsukh cowers in the darkness at the back of the cell, like a trapped animal awaiting the inevitable. \nCUT TO: \n125.   INT.  A MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT                                    125. \nIndiana and Short Round are pushed down a tunnel by guards.  They are stopped at a door and shoved inside. \n126.   INT.  MOLA RAM'S CHAMBER                                       126. \nIndiana and Short Round stumble into the chamber.  It is a terri- fying gallery of occult yantras, ritualistic statues and grisly icons of the evil Thuggee sect. \nGrotesque statues of Kali's baleful minions line the walls.  In a corner, there is another statue of Kali herself, draped with flowers, necklaces of real human skills and slithering belts of live snakes. \nFresh blood has been splashed over the statue and at its base are the three Sankara Stones recovered from Indiana.  Mola Ram sits in a yoga position near the statue of Kali. \nMola Ram opens his eyes and he sees Indiana and Short Round standing in chains before him. \nMOLA RAM You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones. \nINDIANA (shrugging) Nobody's perfect.  The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village. \nMola Ram stands and gazes transfixed at the stones glowing on the altar. \nMOLA RAM There were five stones in the beginning.  Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you... \nINDIANA Two are still missing. \nMOLA RAM No.  They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest his the last two stones down here in the catacombs. \nINDIANA That's what you've got these chil- dren -- these slaves digging for? \nMOLA RAM They dig for the gems to support our cause.  They also search for the last two stones.  Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful! \nINDIANA Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination. \nMOLA RAM You do not believe me?  You will, Dr. Jones.  You will become a true believer. \nThe door opens and Mola Ram bows slightly as the little Maharajah enters.  Indy looks surprised and Short Round tenses. \nMOLA RAM (Cont'd) Your Highness will witness the thief's conversion. \nMola Ram nods and two guards grab Indy.  They drag him struggling to a rock and chain him to it.  Short Round scuffles as he's pulled aside to watch. \nRemembering the High Priest's earlier open-heart surgery, Indi- ana looks worried as Mola Ram approaches him -- \nMAHARAJAH You will not suffer.  I recently became of age and tasted the blood of Kali. \nNow the young initiate comes forward and Indiana looks startled -- it's Nainsukh.  He is wearing robes and his eyes are glowing strangely.  Nainsukh hands Mola Ram a hollow human skull full of blood! \nThe guards hold Indiana's head back and force his mouth open. Mola Ram tips the skull and blood spills out of its death- grinning jaws and flows into Indiana's mouth.  Indy gags -- \nSuddenly he spits the blood, spraying Mola Ram and the little Maharajah.  Looking at his blood-splattered clothes, the Mahara- jah is furious. \nMOLA RAM Hold him! \nThe little prince's eyes glow angrily and he hisses at Indy -- \nMAHARAJAH You will learn to obey because you are powerless! \nThe little Maharajah pulls a small krtya from his robes -- Indy sees that the doll has been crudely fashioned to resemble him. \nMAHARAJAH (Cont'd) I control you now! \nThe Maharajah turns and sticks the doll into a flaming urn.  In- diana suddenly cries out and twists in pain as he is burned!  The little prince smiles evilly and puts the doll back into his robes. \nThen he goes over to where Indy's whip and bag have been laid. He grabs the bullwhip. \nMAHARAJAH (Cont'd) You told me that a whip could be an enemy to its owner.  We shall see!  Turn him over! \nAs the guards turn Indy face down, they rip off his jacket and chain his ahnds to the rock.  The Maharajah uncurls the whip -- he notices Short Round smiling snidely -- \nSuddenly the Maharajah cracks the whip -- it lashes out and cuts into Short Round's shoulder.  Blood appears and Short Round looks stunned by the lash and by the fact the Marahajah knows who to use the whip. \nMAHARAJAH (Cont'd) As Dr. Jones suggested, I have been practicing. \nThe little Maharajah whirls and lashes the whip again.  Indiana jerks as the bullwhip rips through his shirt and tears open his flesh.  The Maharajah lashes again and again -- blood spurts across Indy's tattered shirt. \nAs the whipping continues- Short Round jumps as if he is also be- ing beaten.  His eyes fill with tears as he watches Indy suffer. \nFinally, the little Maharajah lets the whip fall limp.  As the Maharajah approaches Indy, Short Round lunges as him angrily but the guards restrain him. \nIndiana groans as he's turned over.  Blood trickles from his mouth and he stares up hatefully at Mola Ram. \nMOLA RAM The British in India will be slaughtered.  Then we will over- run the Moslems and force their \"Allah\" to bow to Kali. \nMola Ram is once again given the human skull by a priest and he lifts it toward Indy's face -- \n", "test2_true": "Indy's head is held back and Mola Ram spills the blood -- it flows out of the mouth of the skull into Indy's mouth. \nMOLA RAM (Cont'd) Soon Kali Ma will rule the world! \nIndy's eyes look horrified as the blood flows from the skull down his choking throat -- some of the blood spills and falls to the floor -- \nWe see the very earth trembling as the evil spreads -- a fissure appears beneath Indy's feet and a small line of crimson lava oozes out and smiles evilly across the floor... \nCUT TO: \n127.   INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE - NIGHT                                   127. \nDiaphanous curtains billow silently into the moonlighted room. Two exotic birds sit on a golden perch, their eyes clicking watchfully.  Suddenly the brids shriek and flap away -- \nWillie stumbles through the secret door and falls into the room. Insects cover her and she shimpers as she knocks them off.  She manages to stagger to her feet and she heads for the door. \n128.   INT.  THE PALACE - NIGHT                                       128. \nWillie rushes out of her room and runs through the deserted pal- ace looking for help.  She flies down the moonlit corridors, past the huge wall paintings. \nShe stops by a courtyard and calls out desperately, but there is no one around.  She backs away down a hallway and then jumps -- seeing something in a mirror:  a face looms behind her and she screams! \nWillie whirls and sees Chattar Lal, the Prime Minister, approach- ing her. \nWILLIE Oh my God, you scared me!  Listen, you've got to help.  We found this tunnel -- \nCaptain Blumburtt comes around a corner and interrupts -- \nCAPT. BLUMBURTT (to Chattar Lal) Jones isn't in his room.  Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi -- \nWILLIE No -- you can't go!  Something aw- ful's happened.  They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been -- \nCAPT. BLUMBURTT What? \nWILLIE We found a tennel that leads to a temple below the palace!  Please, come with me, I'll show you! \nThe two men exchange dubious looks.  Willie grabs Blumburtt by the arm and they start down the hall. \nCHATTAR LAL Miss Scott, you're not making any sense. \nWILLIE I'm afraid they'll kill them!  We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out! \nCAPT. BLUMBURTT Who? \nWILLIE It's some kind of cult!  And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for. \nCHATTAR LAL I sense the fumes of opium in all this.  Prehaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai. \nWILLIE What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend!  I saw it!  I'll show you! \n129.   INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           129. \nShe leads them into her suite.  Willie points to the dark opening in the wall.  Blumburtt picks up an oil lamp and holds it toward the opening -- suddenly he jumps back as Indiana emerges! \nINDIANA (smiling faintly) What're we playing, hid and seek? \nThey're all startled.  Willie looks relieved and rushes over to Indy and puts her arms around him. \nWILLIE Oh, Indy, you got away!  Tell them what happened, they won't believe me -- \nHe puts his arms around her and feels her trembling from fear and anger.  He walks her to the bed and helps her sit down -- \nINDIANA It's okay.  You're all right now. \nWILLIE They think I'm insane.  Tell them I'm not, Indy.  Please -- help me ... \nThe awful events have taken their toll and Willie covers her face and cries like a scared kid.  Indy gets her to lie down on the bed.  He sits beside her and smiles and touches her hair -- \nINDIANA Hey, I thought you were supposed to be a real tropper.  Willie? \nHe wipes the tears from her face and she holds his hand -- \nWILLIE (quietly) What? \nINDIANA You've got to go to sleep now. \nWILLIE (softly) I want to go home... \nINDIANA I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vaca- tion... \nShe smiles a little despite herself and he touches her cheek. He eyes are already closing and he stands up. \nA servant is entering the suite to take care of Willie.  She cov- sers her with a blanket and start dropping the mosquito netting as Indy walks off toward the verandah with Blumburtt and Chattar Lal. \n130.   EXT.  THE VERANDAH - DAWN                                      130. \nThe first light is breaking over the mountain peaks.  Coming out onto the verandah, Indy and the other two men see the cavalry troops breaking camp below and readying their horses and trucks. \nINDIANA I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me. \nCAPT. BLUMBURTT Miss Scott panicked? \nINDIANA When she saw the insects she passed out cold.  I carried her back to her room.  She was sleeping when I re-entered the tunnel to look around. \n", "test2_id": 1852, "test3_input": "WILLIE (Cont'd) No -- no! \nWillie cries is disbelief as Indiana calmly betrays her. \n140.   INT.  THE MINES BELOW                                          140. \nShort Round races up a tunnel and then flattens himself behind a corner.  He peers anxiously into a large carven and sees two guards walking away. \nWhen the coast is clear, Short Round darts across the cavern to a long wooden ladder tilted up against a wall.  Short Round looks up the high ladder and sees a kid with a sack of rocks descending from a burrow-hole half-way up the wall. \nThe exhausted kid nearly collapses at the bottom -- then jumps seeing Short Round.  Shorty motions for him to keep quiet. Amaxed, the kid watches Short Round scramble up the ladder. Shorty continues until he is high above the floor. \nDirty faces stare out of the high burrow as Short Round stops climbing.  The kids are astonished as Short Round suddenly grunts and kicks the ladder away from the wall! \nThe high ladder falls in an arc and what seem like sure suicide slowly resembles a mini-Indiana Junes stunt as Short Round swings to the other side of the falling ladder -- \nShort Round holds on for dear life as the ladder crashes against the opposite cavern wall -- giving Short Round access to the roof-hole that leads up to the temple! \nShort Round scurries up the ladder and pulls himself up into the chamber behind the altar.  He looks at the light flaring around the statue of Kali -- \nSHORT ROUND Indy -- ! \n141.   INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      141. \nChains clank and gears grind as the sacrificial frame is raised over the crevasse.  Stretched out on it, Willie looks horrified as she hangs suspended face down above the boiling lava! \nThe frame and victim descend slowly into the crevasse and the crowd around the little Maharajah changs louder. \n142.   INT.  THE REAR CHAMBER                                         142. \nShort Round dashes across the dark chamber behind the altar.  He peers out and sees Willie disappearing into the crewasse!  He sees Indiana watching impassively -- \nSHORT ROUND No -- Indy -- wake up! \nThen Shorty sees a flaming torch hanging on a wall bracket and he has an idea. \n143.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                143. \nShort Round suddenly darts out onto the altar and Mola Ram sees him and yells.  Several priests grab for Shorty.  He eludes the first priest, smashes the second in the stomach with his head, and runs like a little quarterback toward the fiery torch -- \nShort Round snatches the torch from the wall and charges toward Indiana.  Seeing him coming, Indy's eyes start glowing yellow and when Short Round runs up to him, Indiana suddenly swings and backhands the little guy brutally across the face! \nThe torch flies out of Shorty's hand as he's knocked against at wall by Indy's vicious blow -- Short Round wipes a little blood from his chin and stares at his hero in wounded disbelief. \nChattar Lal watches approvingly -- a priest moves toward Shorty. Chattar Lal looks back toward the crevasse -- \nWillie hangs on the lowering frame, heat waves rising up now to scald her skin and she chokes as the sulphuric air burns her lungs! \nMeanwhile Short Round is crawling backwards across the floor with a look of terror on his face -- Indiana stalks him, hissing, snarling, his eyes lgowing -- \nShort Round springs to his feet and tries to run -- Indy grabs him and pulls him -- Shorty's hand grabs for another wall torch and just manages to yank it free! \nIndiana spins Short Round and clutches his throat.  As Indy strangles him, Short Round struggles and finally jams the torch into Indy's side.  The fiery torch burns Indy, smoking as it sears his flesh, and he yells in pain. \nSHORT ROUND Wake up!  It's just a nightmare, Indy!  Wake up, please Indy! \nIndiana writhes in pain and Short Round sees the evil yellow glow in Indy's eyes getting dimmer and finally going out.  Now it seems like theold Indiana staring at him -- \nSHORT ROUND (Cont'd) Indy, you back? \nSuddenly a priest grabs Short Round and pulls him off Indiana. \nINDIANA No!  Give him to me! \nShort Round is firghtened as Indy grabs him from the priest. Indy lifts Short Round into the air -- \nSHORT ROUND No, Indy, no! \nHe sets Short Round down on the brink of the crevasse an inch from doom.  Shorty looks down at the lava and is terrified. Indiana finally flahses him a quick smile and winks! \nThen Indiana whirls and punches the priest in the face!  Short Round cheers, realizing that Indiana is back. \nSHORT ROUND (Cont'd) We got to help Willie! \nIndiana springs into action, stopping another priest with a quick punch in the stomach.  Then he rushes over to the crankwheel and pulley platform.  Indy jumps onto it, yanking one priest off who spills onto the floor. \nA second priest, who works the controls lowering the sacrificial frame, sees Indy and releases the crankwheel -- \nDown in the crevasse, Willie screams as the iron frame suddenly plummets toward the fulminating lava! \nOn the platform, the priest lunges at Indiana -- Indy uses the man's own momentum to throw him over his head.  Indy then dives for the crankwheel and manages to stop it -- \nDown in the crevasse, the fram jolts to a stop only yards above the spumes of fiery lava.  The heat is so intense now that Wil- lie's clothes start smoking and she passes out... On the platform above, Indiana cranks furiously, raising the sa- crificial frame. \n144.   INT.  THE TEMPLE                                               144. \nThe chanting stops at the Kali worshippers notice the battle on the altar.  The little Maharajah looks concerned and leaves, shoving through the crowd behind his bodyguards. \n145.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                145. \nMola Ram shouts at his priests and another one of them runs to- ward Indy on the platform.  Short Round dives and tackles the priest. \nChattar Lal finally leaps onto the crankwheel platform and Indy sees him pull a dagger.  He slashes at Indiana and Indy has to let go of the crankwheel -- the gears scream and the chains screech! \n", "test3_true": "On the platform, Indy hears the frame lowering and looks pan- icked.  Chattar Lal slahses again with the dagger -- keeping Indy away from the cogwheel mechanism -- \nIndy suddenly kicks the dagger from Chattar Lal's hand slugs him in the stomach and dives toward the cogwheel mechanism.  He grabs a iron rod and throws it into the gears -- \nthe gears mangle the iron rod but finally grind to a stop.  Indi- ana grabs the crankwheel and starts winding it up furiously. \nMeanwhile, Short Round jumps onto the platform with Indy and grabs a long wrench.  He starts swinging the wrench, keeping the last priests off the platfrom. \nThe sacrificial frame finally rises up into view and Indiana grabs it and swings it over onto the platform.  He looks at Wil- lie anxiously as he releases her bindings -- \nWillie moans and moves her head.  Indy pulls her off the frame and she starts coughing.  Gasping for breath, Willie ervives as fresh air flows into her lungs. \nFinally Willie opens her eyes and she sees Indiana.  Then she notices something else and manages to cry out hoarsely -- \nWILLIE Look out -- ! \nChattar Lal grabs a pistol from an unconscious guard and Indiana whirls to see him pointing it -- Indy kicks the gun from his hand and suddenly Chattar Lal starts shouting in a terrifying voice -- \nChattar Lal's eyes glow as he lunges suicidally at Indiana, at- tempting to take Indy with him as he dives from the platform! \nCrashing into Indy, Chattar Lal knocks both of them back onto the sacrificial frame which swings out over the crevasse -- \nIndy manages to dive off the frame just in time.  He grabs hold of the platform as the crankwheel screams and the frame falls! \nLooking up from the depths of the crevasse, we see the frame with Chattar Lal on it plummeting downward into the sulphurous smoke! The frame finally crashes, splashing into the molten lava. \nChattar Lal's body explodes inot flame friefly -- his flesh is broiled off in an instant -- we glimpse a skeleton momentarily -- and then all is consumed and obliterated by the blazing lava. \nscramble over to Short Round who jumps off the platform and they follow him across the altar. \nIndy sees Mola Ram quickly collecting the sacred Sankara Stones. Indiana rushes over and spins Mola Ram around -- \nHe slugs the High Priest in the face and Mola Ram keels over backwards against the statue of Kali.  Short Round helps stuff the Sankara Stones into Indiana's shoulder bag. \n146.   INT.  THE REAR CHAMBER                                         146. \nShort Round, Willie and Indiana rush across the chamber behind the altar.  They run over to the ladder and start climbing down into the mines. \n147.   INT.  THE MINES \nWillie follows Short Round.  Indiana jumps down last and pulls the ladder away, letting it crash to the floor so they won't be followed. \nThey draw the attention of the slave children working in the tun- nels around the cavern.  But it's the sight of the approaching guard that worries Indy -- \nINDIANA Come on, quick! \nThey duck into one of the tunnels.  As they hide, Indy watches the guard passing. \nWILLIE What're we going to do? \nIndiana looks around at the silent, frightened children who've stopped working in the tunnel and his anger darkens -- \nINDIANA We're going to get them out of here -- ! \nThen he looks at the bag holding the Sankara Stones and grows still more determined -- \nINDIANA (Cont'd) And then we're going to get these out of here -- ! (seething) And somehow I'm going to see this place destroyed. \n148.   INT.  THE CAVERN - MOMENTS LATER                               148. \nA gaurd passing hears a voice and stops -- \nINDIANA (O.S.) Ah, sir?  Excuse me -- \nThe guard turns and looks amazed to see Indy smiling at him from the mouth of the tunnel. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) Listen, I'm from the union and I'd like to talk about the working conditions here.  Could you step inside a minute? \nIndy smiles again and disappears into the tunnel.  In astonished rage, the guard draws his sword and goes after Indy into the tun- nel -- there's a pause and then we hear the guard yell! \n149.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               149. \nWillie flattens against the wall as Indiana catapaults the big guard past her back into the mine where he's set upon bu a horde of rebellious slave children. \nThe kids swarm over the guard like jackalas and we see Short Round pull a key from the struggling guard's robe. \nCUT TO: \n150.   MONTAGE - THE MINES                                            150. \nA key is twisted and the chains are pulled from kids' legs... \nElsewhere, more chains are unlocked and rattle free.  Liberated kids spill out of the tunnels... \nA guard is tripped and attacked by a horde of ex-slaves... \nIn another location, kids wrap captured guards in layers of chains... \nHigh up on a ledge, a fleeing gaurd skids to a stop when he sees kids charging at him.  He sees more kids rushing from behind him. The guard scrams as he dives off the ledge... \n(END MONTAGE) \n151.   INT.

{"train": "INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM \nSTORY BY: \nGEORGE LUCAS \nSCREENPLAY BY: \nWILLARD HUYCK AND GLORIA KATZ \nTM* & (c) Lucasfilm Ltd., 1984 \nFADE IN: \n1.     INT.  \"THE DRAGON\" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                            1. \nA Chinese GONG SOUNDS and the glittering doors of an art Deco pa- poda slide open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway down which rows of beautiful women start descending   (BEGIN MAIN TITLES) \nThe lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange, haunting melody -- one might think them a heavenly choir, if it weren't for their sexy, clinging lame gowns. \n2.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                             2. \nFrom the ethereal beauties, we cut to a street urchin's dirty face: SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kis wearing a beat- up American baseball cap. \nSneaking into the club, Short Round weaves past the fancy gowns and silk suits, heading toward the music in the main ballroom. \n3.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                              3. \nShort Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub.  On the stage, he sees a giant paper-mache dragon laying curled around the pagoda. \nNow, the dragon's eyes light up, its nostrils exhale smoke and its enormous jaws open.  Out of the dragon's mouth walks the star of the stage show: \nWILLIE SCOTT, a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the or- chestra wails the accompaniment. \nBut Short Round's not here to ogle crooning dames.  He surveys the rich Chinese, American and European revelers.  Jewels flash and champagne flows.  Short Round finally spots a table of somber-looking Chinese men in suits. \nShort Round chews gum and stares at the men.  Then he turns to go.  WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches Short Round leave. \n4.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                            4. \nAs Short Round hurries toward the exit, he bumps into a man in a tuxedo entering the club.  Short Round looks up at the man, but we don't see his face. \nThen Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a door- man hustles him out the door, Short Round yelling insults all the way. \nA maitre d' apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-check girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the ballroom. We notice something incongruous:  the man in the tuxedo is wear- ing work boots caked with mud. \n5.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                             5. \nThe man in the tuxedo stops to watch Willie Scott singing sexily on the stage.  Then he looks around and sees the table of somber Chinese men that Short Round spotted earlier. \nAs the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table, he removes a cigarette from a silver case.  He arrives at the table just as the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo -- \nAnd on the stage, a glistening, muscular slave swings a huge ham- mer toward an enormous brass gong -- \nThe man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a cigarette- girl and, as the GONG BOOMS, the match flares to reveal his face for the first time: \nIt's INDIANA JONES.  Elegant in a tuxedo -- dressed to kill.  The TITLES END and over this a legend appears on the screen: \nSHANGHAI - 1935 \nAt the table, the four Chinese man in suits stare coldly at Indi- ana. \nLAO Dr. Jones. \nINDIANA Lao She. \nLAO Nee chin lie how ma? \nLao's men laugh and assume that Indy doesn't understand his joke. \nINDIANA Wah hung how, nee nah?  Wah hwey hung jing chee jah loo nee kao soo wah shu shu. \nLAO SHE looks angry and his men's smiles fade. \nLAO You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones. \nINDIANA I don't like to show off. \nIndiana takes a seat across the table from Shanghai's notorious crime-lord.  Lao is fifty, wealthy enough to now display some fat, but still muscular from his fight to the top of the garbage heap. \nLAO For this special occasion, I ordered champagne and caviar. \nIndiana looks at the pile of caviar on the plate in front of him -- and stubs his cigarette out in it.  The cigarette sizzles and Lao's smiles dies with it. \nThere's applause as Wille Scott finishes her song.  At the table, Lao stares at Indiana with a strange intensity. \nLAO So, it is true, Dr. Jones?  you found Nurhachi? \nINDIANA Sure, I found him.  Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat. \nIndiana looks across the table at Lao's son, CHEN, who resembles a bulldog and snarls like one now. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) It was dark, but I think one of your sons tried to get Nurhachi without paying for him. \nINDIANA (sadly) Wu Han's not coming, Shorty. \nUnaware of what happened at the club, Short Round thinks a mo- ment. \nSHORT ROUND Don't worry, Indy.  Short Round number one bodyguard now! \nWillie reaches for the extra ticket. \nWILLIE I'll take the extra ticket. (grabbing it from Indy) Where's this plane going anyway? \nINDIANA Siam. \nWILLIE Siam?  But I'm not dressed for Siam... \n12.    EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                   12. \nLeaving behind the squalid port, the Duesenberg flies along the highway through the trees.  In a moment, Lao's two sedans race by. \n13.    EXT.  NANG TAO AIRFIELD - NIGHT                                13. \nThe Duesenberg swings around a curve and skids through gravel to- ward the airfield.  In the distance there is a small terminal but Short Round wheels the car toward the cargo area -- \nA two-engine passenger plane is revving its motors and the last passengers are boarding.  The Duesenberg squeals to a stop and Indy jumps out with Willie and Short Round right on his heels. \nA contingent of airport Military Police move to bar their way until WEBER, a heavy-set Englishman, runs up pufffing and shout- ing. \nWEBER No, no, they're all right! Let them through please. \nINDIANA Thanks, Weber. \nWEBER Dr. Jones, this is positively the last time our airline can hold a plane for you.  Now you must hurry! \nWhile Short Round grabs a small bag out of the car, Weber and a stewardess take their tickets and rush them all toward the air- plane. \nMeanwhile, the two sedans skid to a stop and Lao and his son Kao Kan jumpsout with their henchmen.  The puzzled military police advance on them usspiciously  -- \nRealizing he's outnumbered, Lao instructs his men to stay back and to put away their weapons. \n14.    EXT.  THE AIRPLANE                                             14. \nWillie and Short Round charge up the ladder and onto the plane. Indy pauses at the top of the steps to give Lao a cocky farewell salute.  Indy boards the plane and the co-pilot slams the door. \n15.    EXT.  THE AIRFIELD                                             15. \nThe plane starts taxiing.  By the cars, Lao is buffeted by the prop wash as he angrily watches the plane roll away.  Behind Lao, his son, Kao Kan, stares at the plane taking off  -- a look on Kao Kan's face indicates that he hasn't given up yet... \nThe plane lifts off the airfield, silhouetted against the clouds and the first light of dawn. \nCUT TO: \n16.    EXT.  THE DKY - MORNING                                        16. \nThe sun flashes above the horizon and the plane banks through white billowing clouds at it heads west. \n17.    INT.  THE PLANE                                                17. \nA door opens at the rear of the plane and Indiana Jones exits wearing more familiar attire:  a beat-up leather jacket over a khaki shirt and a snap-brim hat.  He passes a dozen passengers as he moves up the aisle carrying his rolled-up tuzedo. \nIn the first row, Willie is busy fixing her make-up.  Shorty sits in the seat across the aisle from her.  Indy comes up and drops his tuxedo onto the floor. \nWillie sees him hook his coiled bullwhip over a coat-peg. \nWILLIE So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer? \nINDIANA Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest?  Okay, doll? \nIndy pats her leg -- she removes his hand and reaches down and picks up his tuxedo coat.  She slips it on. \nWILLIE I'm freezing.  What do you mean, tag along?  From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me. \nINDIANA Oh yeah? \nHe smiles and tips his hat down over his eyes to go to sleep... \n18.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              18. \nAt the same moment, the Chinese co-pilot tips his hat up off his eyes -- and looks scared to death!  He exclaims in Chinese -- \nCO-PILOT (*subtitled*) Good lord! \nHe and the pilot see two biplanes materialize out of the clouds and dive directly toward them!  Suddenly, machine gunfire erupts! \nPILOT (*subtitled) Dive for the clouds!  Dive! \n19.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            19. \nThe DC-3 banks into the clouds as the two biplanes attack.  In the back seat of the first biplane, we see Kao Kan watching the DC-3 like a hawk about to bring down a sparrow. \n20.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              20. \nThe biplanes swoop past both sides of the plane and bursts of gunfire rip along the fuselage. \nCO-PILOT (*subtitled) They hit a fuel line! \nAs the first fighter appears off their side, Short Round blasts out the open door!  The machine gun explodes to life, chewing bullets, smoking and spitting shells at Willie -- \nWillie hollers terrified by manages to feed the ammo belt as Short Round sights the blazing machine gun -- suddenly he shoops! \nWillie sees the fighter hit -- it smokes and veers away -- and then EXPLODES! \nSHORT ROUND I get it! \nWILLIE You got it! \nThe second plane swoops down and Short Round blasts away.  This time as he swivels the gun, he misses and hits one of the DC-3's own engines and it explodes! \nSHORT ROUND Oh oh -- big mistake! \n28.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              28. \nTrying to figure out the controls, Indy looks up to see their en- gine explose into flames -- \nINDIANA (angrily) Short Round, what in the hell are you doing? \nSuddenly the DC-3 emerges out of a cloud and Indy sees they are headed directly for a mountain!  He pulls back hard on the con- trols as a rocky peak looms lethally in front of them. \n29.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            29. \nThe DC-3 lifts at the last second and smashes some snow off the uppermost pinnacle as it clears the mountain by inches! \nKao Kan's fighter is glued to the DC-3's tail and continues to strafe -- but the fighter pilot pulls up too late -- and the fighter explodes as it hits the peak of the mountain! \n30.    INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      30. \nIndy rushes out of the smoking cockpit to find Willie and Short Round crawling out from under the debris that's fallen on them. Then Indy spots something in the wreckage -- \nHe pulls at some yellow canvas and Willie sees as sign: EMERGENCY LIFE RAFT.  Indy drags the folded canvas over to the open door. \nWILLIE Are you crazy, a lift raft?!  We're not sinking, we're crashing! \nINDIANA Get over here, damn it!  Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight! \nWillie sees Short Round rush over to Indiana and grab him around the waist from behind.  Willie finally jumps up and runs over -- \nWILLIE Wait for me! \nShe throws her arms around Indy's neck so that she and Shorty are both hugging him from behind.  Indy clutches the folded lift raft in front of him and surveys the mountainside rushing close be- neath the skinking airplane -- \nFinally, an instant before the plane will hit, Indy dives and pulls the inflation cord! \n31.    EXT.  THE SKY                                                  31. \nAs the smoking DC-3 screams out of control toward the mountain, skimming the rocky snow-covered slopes, we see the lift raft spilling out the open door -- \nThe raft pops into its full shape, acting now as a spoiler, soar- ing against the rushing wind and finally crashing and bouncing against the snowy mountainside. \nIn the distance, we see the DC-3 finally kiss the earth and ex- plode in a cloud of flame against a rocky escarpment -- metal and earth mushrooming in a million directions! \n32.    EXT.  THE MOUNTAINSIDE                                         32. \nAs the raft rockets down the snow, Indiana clutches the front and Willie and Short Round hold on for dear life on either side of him. \nThe raft plummets down the mountain, crossing the timber-line and entering a forest.  Bouncing over a snow-hidden log, the raft shoots directly for a tree -- \nIndiana pulls on the perimeter rope, rolls on his side and man- ages to swerve the raft so it caroms offthe snow-drifted side of the tree trunk. \nContinuing its downhill run, the raft smashes across a small steam, sending silvery water spraying. \nAs the raft skids below the snow-level, it starts bouncing over rocky ground and its three passengers' teeth start chattering. \n33.    EXT.  A BLUFF                                                  33. \nThe yellow raft crashes through a tangle of bushes and then plum- mets toward a bluff!  The raft goes airborne over a small bluff and lands with a splash in a slow-moving river. \n34.    EXT.  THE RIVER                                                34. \nThe life raft drifts down the river and Indy looks around and smiles cockily at Willie and Short Round -- \nTheir faces don't show gratitude, but horror -- Indy hears some- thing and turns to see: \n35.    EXT.  WHITE WATER RAPIDS                                       35. \nThe raft is heading directly toward a surging stretch of treach- erous rapids.  Indiana looks less cocky as he and Willie and Short Round hold on again for dear life! \nThe raft plunges into the roaring torrent, bouncing over rock- swollen waves, twisting and spinning through narrow gaps.  The three helpless passengers are drenched in the thundering cascades of white water. \nWillie is hallering, Short Round hangs on wide-eyed and even Indy looks terrified as the raft crashes down the rapids.  Finally, after one heart-stopping bounce, the raft seems to slow. \n36.    EXT.  RIVER CLEARING                                           36. \nThe raft drifts out of the main part of the river and glides to- ward a clearing.  Its three soaked and bedraggled passengers lie motionless in the bottom. \nIndy's hand drags alongside the raft, his fingers leaving a trail in the almost still water.  Battered and exhausted, but always Indy's \"bodyguard\", Shorty looks over at him worriedly -- \nSHORT ROUND Indy? \nINDIANA Okay, Shorty. \nINDIANA Hasn't the Pankot palace been de- serted since the Mutiny of 1857? \nSHAMAN (darkly) No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again. \nThe shaman looks around at his unfortunate people. \nSHAMAN (Cont'd) It is Pankot Palace that kills my village. \nINDIANA I don't understand.  What's hap- pened here? \nSHAMAN The evil starts in Pankot.  Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country. \nINDIANA What evil? \nSHAMAN They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village. \nWillie looks over at Indiana -- \nWILLIE Took what? \nINDIANA It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village. \nSHAMAN It is why Krishna brought you here. \nINDIANA (politely firm) Nobody brought us here.  Our plane crashed.  We were shot down by -- \nSHAMAN (interrupting) No.  We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone.  It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace.  To find siva- linga -- and bring back to us. \nIndy's about to object -- then he looks at the sad chieftain, the elders and peasants who are watching him helplessly.  And he sees again the dark steady eyes of the old shaman. \nCUT TO: \n40.    EXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE - NIGHT                                 40. \nTorches falre eerily and dogs howl as the peasants accompany the shaman, elders and three visitors out ot the edge of the dark village.  Short Round walks beside Indy. \nSHORT ROUND Indy, they make out plane crash? To get you here? \nINDIANA It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story. \nShort Round looks plenty scared as they all stop walking.  The shaman motions and the men with torches circle around a pile of rocks to illuminate them.  The shaman makes a gesture of devotion to the primitive shrine and Indy speaks to the village chieftain. \nCHIEFTAIN Yes. \nIndiana seems skeptical as he kneels to study the shrine.  On top of the pile of rocks, there is a carved niche.  The niche is empty but an indentation indicates the conical shape of the stone that was stolen. \nINDIANA Was the stone very smooth? (he sees the chieftain nod) It was probably brought here from a sacred river. \nSHAMAN (joining Indy and the chieftain) Long ago -- before my father's father. \nINDIANA And it had three lines painted across it? (seeing the shaman nod) The lines represent the three levels of the universe.  I've seen stones like the one you lost. \nIndy stands slowly.  Willie is beside him looking at the shrine. \nWILLIE I don't understand how losing one rock could destroy this village. (whispering to Indy) Is it really powerful? \nIndy gives a doubtful smile.  He turns again to the old shaman. \nINDIANA But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone? \nSHAMAN They say we must pray to their evil god.  We say we will not. \nThe old shaman looks off and fights the tears in his eyes as he starts speaking in Hindi. \nINDIANA (translating) He says that when the sacred stone was taken the village wells dried up first and then the river stopped. \nIndy turns and asks the shaman a question in Hindi.  The shaman answers in Hindi. \nINDIANA (translating) He says their crops dies and then the animals died. \nThe shaman walks to the edge of the torchlight and looks out into the darkness as he continues speaking emotionally in Hindi -- \nINDIANA (translating) And then they took their children. \nWILLIE Their children? \nShe looks at Short Round and finally understands the sorrowful faces always watching him.  Indy asks another question in Hindi and the shaman continues his story -- \nINDIANA (translating) He says one night there was a fire in the fields.  The men went to fight it.  When they came back, they heard the women crying in the darkness.  And the children were gone. \nThe shaman walks slowly toward Indiana. \nSHAMAN You will find them when you find sivlalinga. \nINDIANA I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here. \nThe shaman and the chieftain stare and Indiana, refusing to accept that. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) The English authorities who con- trol this area are the only ones who can help you. \nCHIEFTAIN They do not listen. \nINDIANA I have friends in Delhi and I will make sure they investigate this... \nCUT TO: \n46.    EXT.  THE COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                    46. \nThe elephants move across the desolate countryside toward the distant hills. \n47.    EXT.  THE TRAIL                                                47. \nIndiana rides the lead elephant.  Sajnu passes on foot guiding Willie's elephant.  With the tuxedo jacket wrapped around her waist, Willie is dabbing perfume behind her ears. \nWILLIE (to her elephant) I think you need this more than me. \nWillie leans forward and puts perfume behind the elephant's ears. Grimacing at the animal's smell she simply dumps the rest of the perfume on the elephant's back. \nWillie yelps when the elephant's trunk comes back, sniffs the foriegn fragrance and suddenly trumpets in disgust. \nWILLIE (Cont'd) What're you complaining about, this is expensive stuff! \nCUT TO: \n48.    EXT.  LOWER JUNGLES - DAY                                      48. \nFrom a cliff, we see the elephants below passing into the lower jungles. \nSpotting something on an overhanging tree branck, Short Round stands up precariously on the baby elephant's back.  He pulls a vine from the tree as they pass under it.  Plopping down onto the baby elephant's back, he picks the wild fruit from the vine -- \nSHORT ROUND Here you go, lunch time! \nThe baby elephant's trunk comes back and takes the fruit.  Shorty looks up in the sky. \nSHORT ROUND (Cont'd) Indy, look! \nIndiana and Willie look up and see hundreds of enormous winged creatures flapping across the afternoon sky. \nWILLIE Those are very big bird. \nSajnu says something and Indiana nods. \nINDIANA Those aren't birds -- those are giant bats. \nWillie shudders as she watches the bats. \nCUT TO: \n49.    EXT.  THE HILLS - AFTERNOON                                    49. \nAn enormous sun silhouettes the three elephants trekking west- ward. \nCUT TO: \n50.    EXT.  A RIVER - LATER AFTERNOON                                50. \nThe three elephants stand sucking up river water with their trunks.  Seated on the huge beasts, Willie, Short Round and Indi- ana watch the thirsty animals. \nWILLIE They must be pretty dumb to drink that awful-looking water. \nIn response, Willie's elephant calmly lifts its trunk and sprays her in the face.  Short Round and Indy laugh as Willie sits soaked and shocked. \nINDIANA I think maybe we'll camp here. \nCUT TO: \n51.    EXT.  THE RIVER - SUNSET                                       51. \nA plume of water sprays.  The three elephants submerge in a deep, wide spot in the river.  Indy wades in the current with his shirt off.  He and the guide splash water on the weary animals. \nShort Round laughs and plays with the baby elephant.  Wrapped in its trunk, he's swung in the air and lands on the elephant's back.  Shorty makes a swan dive back into the water and the baby elephant gives him a shower when he surfaces. \n52.    EXT.  UPRIVER                                                  52. \nThirty yards upstream, birds and monkeys chatter in a tree.  In the shady river beneath, Willie surfaces cooly and wipes hair from her eyes.  She hums contendedly. \nIndiana wanders up the riverbank in his dripping trousers.  He notices Willie's wet clothes spread over a tree limb hanging low over the water and then he sees Willie paddling around. \nINDIANA Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now. \nWILLIE Stark naked?  You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach. \nINDIANA Me seduce you?  Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off. (shrugging) I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water. \nWILLIE Somehow I feel safer in here. \nAs Indy turns and starts off, Willie reaches up to the tree branch above her head and grabs her underwear.  At this moment we notice something awful: \nA BOA CONSTRICTOR is moving out along the branch, the enormous snake slithering over Willie's clothes. \nWillie watches Indiana walk away as she reaches up for her dress -- her hands feel something strange -- not the dress and not the tree limb -- \nWillie looks up and sees that she's pulling on a snake! She SCREAMS as the boa constrictor falls off the t-ee on top of her! \nIndy hears the scream and hears Willie calling to him.  He runs back toward the river.  Stopping on the riverbank, he sees Willie backing away in the water -- Indiana's already starting to pull his boots off -- \nWILLIE Indy!  Help me! \nSHORT ROUND You come to America with me, and we can get job in the circus -- you like that? \nThe baby elephant trumpets affirmitively. \nA ways off, Willie stands wrapped in a blanket watching Shorty and the elephant as she dries her hair by a campfire.  Now Indy comes up and drops an armload of wood for yet another fire. \nWILLIE Where'd you find your little body- guard? \nINDIANA I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket. \nIndiana kneels and arranges the wood. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai.  He was living on the streets. \nWILLIE (smiling) He'll be okay.  He's a good kid. \nIndy strikes a match and lights the new fire. \nWILLIE (Cont'd) All these fires -- you expecting more snakes, Dr. Jones? \nShe smiles snidely and continues drying her hair. \nINDIANA By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai? \nWILLIE Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that \"a girl could go places in the Orient...\" So, look where I got. \nIndy picks up a blanket and spreads it on the ground. \nINDIANA What about the future? \nWILLIE Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, in- credibly rich prince. \nIndy lies down on the blanket. \nINDIANA I'd like to find one of those myself. \nWILLIE (raising an eyebrow) Oh really? \nINDIANA Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years. (smiling) Fortune and glory... \nWILLIE Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones? \nINDIANA Maybe... \nIndy reaches into his pocket and removes the old piece of cloth. \nWILLIE What's that? \nShe walks over to where he's lying down and sits on a boulder. He hands her the cloth and she looks at it by the firelight. \nINDIANA Something that kid gave me last night.  It's a piece of an old manuscript. \nWillie sees a crude drawing in reds, blue and gold. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago. \nWILLIE What does the writing say? \nINDIANA It's Sanskrit.  It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva. \nWILLIE (examining it) That's Shiva?  What's he giving the Priest? \nINDIANA Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil.  To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers. \nWILLIE (looking at Indy) You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village? \nIndy looks at her meaningfully. \nINDIANA It could be. \nWillie seems frightened.  She hands him the piece of cloth and stands up. \nWILLIE (quietly) Fortune and glory...sweet dreams, Dr. Jones. \nShe picks up a blanket and starts off. \nINDIANA I think you should sleep closer. (seeing her sus- picious look) I meant for safety. \nWILLIE (smiling) I'd be safer sleeping with that snake. \nShe steps over to a tree by the fire where her clothes are dry- ing.  Indy watches her pull her dried clothes from the lower branches. \nShe reaches up to remove another piece of her clothing -- it's stuck to the tree and she looks up and yanks it.  Suddenly the piece of clothing moves! \nTwo enormous winds open and the hideous face of a GIANT BAT screeches and hisses at Willie!  She screams hysterically as the bat flaps against her, biting and scratching at her before it fi- nally takes off. \nThe bat flies off into the darkness and Indy chuckles as he watches Willie shanking as she backs slowly toward the fire -- \nWILLIE Did you see it?!  It was one of those bats! (staring into the darkness) God, what else is out there...?! \nShe quickly picks up her blanket and lays it out very close to Indy. \nINDIANA Couldn't keep away, huh? \nThen, a tall severe-looking Indian in an English suit material- izes out of the shadows and comes forward slowly.  CHATTAR LAL appraises the intruders suspiciously: \nHe sees a whoozy beauty in a weary evening gown;  a dirty Chinese kid with a baseball cap; a rugged-looking American carrying a bullwhip... \nCHATTAR LAL I would say you look rather lost. (disdainfullt) But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home... \nINDIANA (smiling evenly) Lost?  No, we're not lost.  We're on our way to Delhi.  This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round.  My name's Indiana Jones. \nCHATTAR LAL (surprised) Dr. Jones?  The eminent archae- ologist? \nWILLIE Hard to believe, isn't it...? \nCHATTAR LAL I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford.  I Am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot. \nHe bows and Willie sort of curtsies. \nCHATTAR LAL (Cont'd) Welcome to Pankot Palace. \n59.    INT.  PANKOT PALACE - AFTERNOON                                59. \nThey walk along the marble halls, past dazzling walls inlaid with pieces of mirror and semi-precious stones.  Fountains spray in ivory countyards and they gaze in awe at the ornate splendour. \nAs Willie walks with Shorty she appraises the chronolgoical portraits of the Pankot Prices that line the hall.  Dissipated faces, elegant faces, evil faces -- she reacts to them. \nWILLIE (to Short Round) How'd you like to run into him in a dark alley...that one's kind of cute...I could see myself married to a prince like that... \nAhead of them Chattar Lal  walks with Indy and questions him suspiciously -- \nCHATTAR LAL The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible. \nWILLIE You should have been there... \nINDIANA We'd appreciate it if the Mahara- jah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morn- ing. \nCHATTAR LAL I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice. \nWILLIE Is that him? \nThey've come to the last in the row of Princes portraits.  Wil- lie stops and looks up disappointedly at a picture of an aged, immensely corpulent Rajput prince. \nWILLIE (Cont'd) (politely) He's not exactly what we call \"a spring chicken\". \nCHATTAR LAL No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father. \nWILLIE Oh -- good.  And maybe the pres- ent Marahajah is a little younger? And thinner? \nTwo female servants approach silently and bow. \nCHATTAR LAL They will escort you to your rooms now.  You will be provided with fresh clothes.  Tonight you will be dining with His Highness. \nWILLIE Dinner?  And with a prince?!  My luck is changing.  But look at me -- my god, I've to to get ready! \nShe hurried off with one of the servants toward her room.  Chat- tar Lal smiles cooly at Indiana -- \nCHATTAR LAL Eight o'clock in the Pleasure Pavilion. \nCUT TO: \n60.    EXT.  THE PLEASURE PALIVION - NIGHT                            60. \nAn extraordinary gold dome rises in the middle of the eleaborate gardens.  The Pleasure Pavilion is ablaze with torch lights, flickering candles and exotic music. \nIndiana comes out of the palace with Short Round.  Indy has on a tweed jacket and a nectie -- his university professor's outfit. Short Round has been cleaned up, but still sports his baseball cap. \nWillie joins them, looking stunning is a silk Western-styled gown.  She's also been loaned some Moghul jewelry which sparkles on her neck and arms. \nINDIANA You look like a princess. \nWillie's flattered by the first nice thing Indy's said to her. \nWILLIE It's sort of like being in heaven. \nThey cross the garden toward the pavilion and Willie's eyes are like a kid's at Christmas. \n61.    INT.  THE PLEASURE PAVILION                                    61. \nAs they enter, Indiana gives a half-dressed dancing girl the once-over as she spins to the music of drums and \"vinhas\". \nINDIANA (smiling) I've always had a weakness for folk dancing. \nWILLIE (snidely) She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub. \nThey walk among the rich court ministers and Indian merchants. Chattar Lal approaches with a British cavalry captain in unifrom. \nCHATTAR LAL We are fortunate tonight to have some many unexpected guests.  his is Captain Phillip Blumburtt. \nBlumburtt bows to Willie and Indiana. \nCHATTAR LAL (Cont'd) Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the \"natives\". \nCAPT. BLUMBURTT (politely) Just a routine inspection tour. \nCHATTAR LAL The British worry so about their Emprie -- it makes us feel like well-cared-for children. \nSHORT ROUND Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy!  Then he talk in this real scary voice! \nIndy tousles Short Round's hair. \nINDIANA He was afraid of you.  He knows a tough  guy when he sees one. \nSHORT ROUND (not so shure) Yeah, that's what happened... \nThey reach their room and Short Round opens the door. \nINDIANA I better see how Willie is. \nShort Round shakes his head scornfully as Indy crosses the hall and knocks on another door.  After a moment, the door opens and Willie is standing there in a tempting nightgown. \nINDIANA I brought you something. \nHe holds up something wrapped in a piece of silk. \nWILLIE (disgusted) Not leftovers? \nINDIANA No -- real food. \nWillie opens the bundle suspiciously -- then her hace lights up as she examines the breads and fruits inside. \nWILLIE Oh, it is real food...it's beautiful. \nShe bites happily into a piece of fruit -- its juice runs down her chin and Indy wipes it off gently with his hand.  The mouth deliberately seductive and Willie is not displeased. \nWILLIE (Cont'd) You're nice.  Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave? \nINDIANA (smiling) Wearing your jewels to be, prin- cess? \nIndy touches her necklace -- then his hand caresses her neck and ear.  She shivers slightly and speaks softly. \nWILLIE Yeah -- and nothing else. (smiling) That shock you? \nINDIANA (shaking his head) I'm a scientist.  I like doing research on certain \"nocturnal activities\" -- \nShe smiles and puts a grape to his lips.  He opens his mouth takes it and chews it. \nWILLIE You mean like love rituals... \nHe swallows the grape and they move toward each other slowly to kiss, revealing the passion that's simmering. \nINDIANA And mating customs... \nThey kiss again more heatedly. \nWILLIE Primitive sexual practices? \nINDIANA You're taling to an authority in that area. \nThey kiss again hungrily -- \nWILLIE You're dying to come into my room, aren't you? \nINDIANA You want me so bad, why don't you invite me? \nWILLIE Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones? \nINDIANA I think you're too used to get- ting you own way, Willie... \nThey kiss yet again -- and Indy breaks it off, just to show he's still in control.  He backs away toward his room. \nWILLIE (watching him) We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open. \nINDIANA Don't catch cold. \nWILLIE Dr. Jones -- ? \nIndy stops by his door and sees Willie smiling as she holds up five fingers -- \nWILLIE (Cont'd) Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes... \nINDIANA You're dreaming, Willie.  You want to make it real, just knock on my door. \nHe winks.  She waves.  But neither one will surrender first. Willie does into her room, leaving the door ajar.  Indy opens his door. \n65.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          65. \nIndy comes in and closes the door -- leaving it open a crack.  He stands and listens, waiting for her to come over. \n66.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           66. \nWillie stands likewise by her door, waiting to hear Indy come back over. \n67.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                           67. \nIndiana shrugs and walks over to a couch and starts taking off his tweed jacket and necktie -- \nINDIANA Five minutes... fat chance. \n68.    INT.  WILLIE SUIT                                              68. \nINDIANA What -- the bug? \nWillie is petrified and shaking. \nWILLIE Get -- the -- bug -- off! \nINDIANA Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that! \nSHORT ROUND (grinning) Uh uh -- me neither! \nWillie looks at the man-of-action like he's insane.  Then she feels the bug crawling onto her cheek -- \nWILLIE Oh no -- oh no!! \nINDIANA (studying the bug) You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner. \nWILLIE Please -- oh please, I'm going to die!  Get it off! \nIndiana shrugs and leans over and casually swats the horrible bug off her face.  He and Short Round watch the insect skid across the floor -- and suddenly disappear as if by magic! \nPuzzled, they wander toward the wall, leaving Willie behind, bathed in sweat, staring at the ceiling -- \nWILLIE What did I do to deserve this trip?! \nKneeling by the wall, Short Round examines the baseboard -- \nSHORT ROUND It went under.  Hey, I feel wind, Indy. \nIndiana knocks on the wall and considers the hollow sound.  He moves back and looks at the whole wall.  Behind him, Willie moves past -- \nWILLIE I'm packing!  I'm getting out of here right now tonight! \nShe dashes behind a screen to start getting dressed.  Meanwhile Indy feels the marble walls.  He moves to a niche in which there is a small statue of Ganesha, the friendly elephant god. \nIndiana lifts the statue -- and a panel in the wall opens slow- ly.  Short Round looks amazed.  Indy watches the light fall across the far wall of a tunnel as the door opens slowly. \nIndy peers into the tunnel at an old wall painting.  Spiderly San- skrit calligraphy runs under a flanking illustration of a prince bowing before a god. \nINDIANA *(He reads aloud an inscription in Sanskrit). \nSHORT ROUND What does it mean, Indy? \nINDIANA (translating) \"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva.  Do not betray his truth.\" \nIndy takes out the piece of cloth the boy gave him in Mayapore, the similarities are striking.  It is also a picture of Shiva Sankara. \nINDIANA *(He repeats aloud the inscrip- tion also written on the cloth) \nOver behind the screen, Willie's getting into some silk pants with an Indian-style brocade bodice top -- \nWILLIE I don't care if I have to walk to Delhi, I'm -- hey! \nShe notices Indy and Short Round bending to enter the dark tunnel behind the wall. \nWILLIE (Cont'd) Wait a minute!  What're you -- where're you going?! \nIndy pokes his head back into the room -- \nINDIANA Lock your door and don't leave until we get back. \nHe disappears behind the wall and Willie looks worried. \n75.    INT.  A PALACE TUNNEL - NIGHT                                  75. \nIndy and Short Round enter the secret passage and move forward slowly into the inky darkness. \nSHORT ROUND I don't think we suppose to be in here, Indy... \nThey creep slowly down the dark tunnel.  It grows smaller and Indy ducks his head. \nSHORT ROUND (Cont'd) I step on something. \nTheir footsteps crunch on the tunnel floor. \nINDIANA You're right, there's something all over the floor... \nEven Short Round has to duck and Indy finally kneels to his hands and knees. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) We'll have to crawl. \nAs they crawl, their hands and knees continue to crunch on what- ever it is littering the ground. \nSHORT ROUND Indy, the floor -- there is some- thing alive! \nIndiana gets a match out of his pocket.  He snaps it with his thumb and the match flares -- a hideous insectarium: a living collection of the world's ugliest antropods, hexapods and arch- nids. \nSHORT ROUND Holy smoke -- I'm scared, Indy! \nIndiana turns and sees something else -- \nINDIANA There's a chamber here.  Come on -- \nIndy finds an oil lamp on the wall and lights it.  Short Round happily scampers into the chamber and Indy follows him.  Suddenly the door slides shut -- trapping them inside! \nINDIANA GET US OUT!  Willie, shut up and listen!  There's got to be a ful- crum release!  Look around! \nWILLIE (O.S.) A what?! \n86.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               86. \nWillie whines and frantically searches the wall.  Insects are crawling and jumping on her and she kicks at them! \nINDIANA (O.S.) A fulcrum release lever! \nWILLIE I can't find any lever!  Help me Indy! \n87.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        87. \nIndiana and Short Round are backed against the wall and the spikes are a foot away and moving in -- \nINDIANA Look around, Willie!  There's got to be a liever hidden somewhere!  Come on, you can do it! \n88.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               88. \nInsects drop onto Willie from the ceiling and fly at her as she flattens against the wall.  Then her elbow hits something -- a loose stone.  She claws at it and it falls out of the wall leaving a hole. \nWILLIE There's a hole!  I found a square hole! \nINDIANA (O.S.) That's it -- the release lever -- look inside! \nWILLIE I am -- it looks horrible! \nThe hole is revolting :  covered with squirming insects, it also oozes some kind of glistening mucus. \nINDIANA (O.S.) Reach inside! \nWillie moves her hand toward the nauseating hole then pulls back. \nWILLIE I can't, Indy!  I can't! \n89.    INT.  THE SPIKE TUNNEL                                         89. \nIndiana turns his head sideways and sucks in his breath, but the deadly spikes are poking into his leater jacket now -- \nINDIANA The lever!  Willie, do it!  NOW! \n90.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               90. \nWillie screams and jams her hand into the gross hole -- \nWILLIE Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving! \nINDIANA (O.S.) Willie! \n91.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        91. \nShort Round is frightened to death and crying -- \nSHORT ROUND Willie, help us!  Hurry! \n92.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               92. \nShe hears Short Round crying and twists her hand in the disgust- ing hole.  Suddenly the door springs open!  Willie pulls her hand out and stares in horror -- her hand and arm are covered with greenish slimey mung! \n93.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        93. \nThe spikes suddenly retract, disappearing into the wall and clos- ing.  Indy pulls Willie inside the chamber and the door slams shut again.  Willie dances around, yelling about the hideous slime on her arm. \nWILLIE Get is off me -- get it off! \nIndy helps her wipe it off.  Willie falls back against the door. \nWILLIE (Cont'd) You left me out there!  What in the hell were you doing in here?! I want to leave this place right now!! \nShe sees the same lever that Short Round pulled earlier and grabs for it.  Indiana dives and manages to stop her from activating the spikes agian. \nINDIANA Not that one!  We had enought of that one, thank you... \nHe looks around and spots a small rock protruding from the wall. Cautiously, praying htat it won't activate another booby trap, Indy pushes the rock. \nA large door opens on the other side of the chamber -- a soft wind howls past outside the chamber. \n94.    INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          94. \nIndiana, Short Round and Willie exit the spike chamber and head down a larger tunnel through which a roaring wind intermittantly blows, howling eerily like a note of gloomy music. \nIndiana follows a curve in the tunnel and they see light approaching. The wind holws another dramatic note which gales past them as they reach the mouth of the tunnel. \nIndiana is joined by Willie and Short Round.  They all stop in astonishment at the sight below them: \n95.    INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      95. \nAs the camera pulls back,  the mouth of the wind tunnel in which they are standing becomes just a small hole overlooking the stag- gering vastness of the incredible TEMPLE OF DEATH. \nThe colossal subterranean temple has been carved out of a solid mass of rock.  A vaulting cathedral-like ceiling is supported by rows of carved stone columns. \nBalconies overlook the temple floor.  Pillared halls leading to dark side chambers.  Moving out of these chambers, hundreds of faithful worshippers chant as they enter the temple. \nWillie is crying and her voice is shoking as she turns awa from the hideous ritual -- \nWILLIE Let's go!  Let's get out of here! \nINDIANA Quiet! \n109.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                109. \nThe priests reverently unwrap three conical pieces of crystallized quartz.  The place the three stones below the sta- tue of Kali and slowly the smoke around the altar swirls -- \nThe smoke is drawn to the three stones and they actually start in- haling the piraling smoke.  The smoke disappears into the stones and the air clears.  Then the three stones start to glow a haunting incandescent white. \n110.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          110. \nShort Round looks scared.  Willie is still crying -- Indy waits, horrified but fascinated. \nINDIANA The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones... \nSHORT ROUND Why they glow like that? \nINDIANA Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow. \nWillie wipes her eyes and becomes more interested -- \nWILLIE Diamonds...? \n111.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                111. \nThe Sankara Stones shimmer brightly, and inside the crystallized quartz, the enormous sparkling diamonds of legend are now re- vealed. \nMola Ram stands facing Kali with his arms outstretched and kneels and bows and then walks off the altar and disappears. \n112.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          112. \nIndiana sees the woshippers below start to leave the temple.  He looks at Willie and Short Round. \nINDIANA Okay -- now listen -- you wait here and keep quiet.  Shorty, keep an eye on her. \nShort Round nods and hands Indy his bullwhip and shoulder bag. Willie sees Indiana peering down at the sheer drop below the mouth of the wind tunnel. \nWILLIE Wait -- what're you doing? \nINDIANA I'm going down. \nWILLIE Down?  Down there?!  Are you crazy --! \nINDIANA I'm not leaving without those stones. \nWILLIE You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory! \nINDIANA (looking at her) Maybe...someday. (smiling) Not today. \nSHORT ROUND I keep my eye peeled, Indy. \nIndiana nods and looks down at the now empty temple.  Then he slips down from the mouth of the wind tunnel. \n113.   INT.  THE TEMPLE WALL                                          113. \nIndiana skillfully clumbs down an enormous tmeple column -- find- ing footholds on stone cobras, carved lions and the stone breasts of dancing girls.  Slowly, he makes his way down and swings across a balcony. \n114.   INT.  THE BALCONY                                              114. \nIndiana walks quietly along the balcony overlooking the temple. He stops -- between him and the altar is the crevasse with the lava bubbling fire at the bottom. \nIndiana looks across the gulf and sees another column near the altar at the top of which stone elephants are perched.  Indy curls his whip and suddenly lets it fly -- \nThe whip cracks and its end wraps tightly around the tusk of one of the stone elephants.  From the balcony, Indy tugs the whip taut, takes a breath and runs -- \n115.   INT.  THE CREVASSE                                             115. \nIndiana leaps and swings out on the whip, arching down and up, over the chasm of fiery lava in a spectacular curving jump! \n116.   INT.  THE LATAR                                                116. \nIndy lands on his feet and turns to release the whip.  Short Round waves to Indy that the coast is clear.  Indy snaps the whip -- it releases from the elephant tusk and drops. \nRecurling the whip, Indy attaches it to his belt and moves to- ward the towering statue of Kali.  The three Sankara stones start to glow and Indiana approaches them cautiously. \nReaching the stones, Indy's face is lighted by them.  He notices that one of them (sthe stone from Mayapore village) has strange lines painted across it. \nSuspiciously, Indy touches the stone, but it doesn't burn.  He lifts it carefully and peers into it.  The enormous diamond sparkles inside.  He places the stone in his shoulder bag and reaches for the others. \n117.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          117. \nShort Round and Willie watch apprehensively as Indiana bags the three stones. \n118.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                118. \nIndiana backs away and looks up at the horrific statue of Kali. It seems to be watching him.  He turns and is about to go when he hears something -- \nIt sounds like a voice and Indy is afraid to turn -- could it be Kali?  The he hears other noises echoing and turns slowly.  Real- alizing the sounds are coming from behind the altar, Indy moves around it toward the back. \n119.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          119. \nNAINSUKH They will make me drink blood of Kali.  Then I fall into black sleep of Kali Ma... \nINDIANA What is that? \nNAINSUKH I become like them.  I be  alive -- nut like in nightmare.  You drink the blood, you not wake up from nightmare of Kali Ma. \nThere's a noise and they see two guards and a priest outside the cell.  Nainsukh cowers in the darkness at the back of the cell, like a trapped animal awaiting the inevitable. \nCUT TO: \n125.   INT.  A MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT                                    125. \nIndiana and Short Round are pushed down a tunnel by guards.  They are stopped at a door and shoved inside. \n126.   INT.  MOLA RAM'S CHAMBER                                       126. \nIndiana and Short Round stumble into the chamber.  It is a terri- fying gallery of occult yantras, ritualistic statues and grisly icons of the evil Thuggee sect. \nGrotesque statues of Kali's baleful minions line the walls.  In a corner, there is another statue of Kali herself, draped with flowers, necklaces of real human skills and slithering belts of live snakes. \nFresh blood has been splashed over the statue and at its base are the three Sankara Stones recovered from Indiana.  Mola Ram sits in a yoga position near the statue of Kali. \nMola Ram opens his eyes and he sees Indiana and Short Round standing in chains before him. \nMOLA RAM You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones. \nINDIANA (shrugging) Nobody's perfect.  The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village. \nMola Ram stands and gazes transfixed at the stones glowing on the altar. \nMOLA RAM There were five stones in the beginning.  Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you... \nINDIANA Two are still missing. \nMOLA RAM No.  They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest his the last two stones down here in the catacombs. \nINDIANA That's what you've got these chil- dren -- these slaves digging for? \nMOLA RAM They dig for the gems to support our cause.  They also search for the last two stones.  Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful! \nINDIANA Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination. \nMOLA RAM You do not believe me?  You will, Dr. Jones.  You will become a true believer. \nThe door opens and Mola Ram bows slightly as the little Maharajah enters.  Indy looks surprised and Short Round tenses. \nMOLA RAM (Cont'd) Your Highness will witness the thief's conversion. \nMola Ram nods and two guards grab Indy.  They drag him struggling to a rock and chain him to it.  Short Round scuffles as he's pulled aside to watch. \nRemembering the High Priest's earlier open-heart surgery, Indi- ana looks worried as Mola Ram approaches him -- \nMAHARAJAH You will not suffer.  I recently became of age and tasted the blood of Kali. \nNow the young initiate comes forward and Indiana looks startled -- it's Nainsukh.  He is wearing robes and his eyes are glowing strangely.  Nainsukh hands Mola Ram a hollow human skull full of blood! \nThe guards hold Indiana's head back and force his mouth open. Mola Ram tips the skull and blood spills out of its death- grinning jaws and flows into Indiana's mouth.  Indy gags -- \nSuddenly he spits the blood, spraying Mola Ram and the little Maharajah.  Looking at his blood-splattered clothes, the Mahara- jah is furious. \nMOLA RAM Hold him! \nThe little prince's eyes glow angrily and he hisses at Indy -- \nMAHARAJAH You will learn to obey because you are powerless! \nThe little Maharajah pulls a small krtya from his robes -- Indy sees that the doll has been crudely fashioned to resemble him. \nMAHARAJAH (Cont'd) I control you now! \nThe Maharajah turns and sticks the doll into a flaming urn.  In- diana suddenly cries out and twists in pain as he is burned!  The little prince smiles evilly and puts the doll back into his robes. \nThen he goes over to where Indy's whip and bag have been laid. He grabs the bullwhip. \nMAHARAJAH (Cont'd) You told me that a whip could be an enemy to its owner.  We shall see!  Turn him over! \nAs the guards turn Indy face down, they rip off his jacket and chain his ahnds to the rock.  The Maharajah uncurls the whip -- he notices Short Round smiling snidely -- \nSuddenly the Maharajah cracks the whip -- it lashes out and cuts into Short Round's shoulder.  Blood appears and Short Round looks stunned by the lash and by the fact the Marahajah knows who to use the whip. \nMAHARAJAH (Cont'd) As Dr. Jones suggested, I have been practicing. \nThe little Maharajah whirls and lashes the whip again.  Indiana jerks as the bullwhip rips through his shirt and tears open his flesh.  The Maharajah lashes again and again -- blood spurts across Indy's tattered shirt. \nAs the whipping continues- Short Round jumps as if he is also be- ing beaten.  His eyes fill with tears as he watches Indy suffer. \nFinally, the little Maharajah lets the whip fall limp.  As the Maharajah approaches Indy, Short Round lunges as him angrily but the guards restrain him. \nIndiana groans as he's turned over.  Blood trickles from his mouth and he stares up hatefully at Mola Ram. \nMOLA RAM The British in India will be slaughtered.  Then we will over- run the Moslems and force their \"Allah\" to bow to Kali. \nMola Ram is once again given the human skull by a priest and he lifts it toward Indy's face -- \nCHATTAR LAL As she slept, she undoubtedly had nightmares. \nIndiana looks at him and nods. \nINDIANA Then she must have run out of the room and you found her. \nCAPT. BLUMBURTT Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones? \nIndiana stares into the rising sun. \nINDIANA Nothing.  Just a dead end.  That tunnel's been deserted for years. \nA sergeant-major shouts up to Blumburtt that the troops are ready. \nCAPT. BLUMBURTT Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my re- port will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot. \nCHATTAR LAL I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain. \nCAPT. BLUMBURTT (to Indiana) As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi. \nINDIANA Thanks, but I don't think Willie is ready to travel yet. \nCUT TO: \n131.   EXT.  THE PALACE ROAD - MORNING                                131. \nDust swirls as the British cavalry moves off with their Highland Pipers at the head playing a military bagpipe tune.  Capt. Blum- burtt comes out of the palace and gets into an open car. \nBlumburtt's car moves off behind the cavalry and then the supply trucks follow. \n132.   INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           132. \nThe whine of the bagpipes is eerily muted in the dark room. Through the gently swaying mosquito netting, we see Willie asleep on the bed. \nThen through her side of the gauzy netting, we see the door opening across the room.  Indiana enters quietly and moves toward the bed, his eyes fixed on Willie's sleeping body. \nIndy sits down on the bed slowly.  Willie turns in her sleep and opens her eyes.  Through the mosquito netting she sees Indy sit- ting with his back to her. \nWILLIE Indy?  Did you walk to them? \nINDIANA Yes. \nWILLIE So now they believe me. \nINDIANA Yes, they believe you. \nIndiana speaks in a strange monotone. \nWILLIE Then they'll send the soldiers down into the temple... \nWillie looks at Indiana's back and continues quietly. \nWILLIE (Cont'd) I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you. \nINDIANA No... they won't kill me. \nWILLIE (smiling faintly) You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you... \nNow Indiana starts to turn slowly. \nINDIANA You won't lose me, Willie... \nShe sees him turn and his face slowly comes toward the mosquito netting -- his face pushes into the netting and Willie looks stunned as Indy's mouth opens -- \nHe starts hissing grotesquely, smoke billows out of his mouth and the mosquito netting BURNS OPEN to expose his terrifying face moving toward Willie -- \nShe is forzen with fear and unable to utter a sound as Indy's malevolent face looms at her -- and then she notices his eyes -- his eyes glowing a hellish luminscent yellow! \nWillie SCREAMS!! \nShe suddenly bolts from the bed and tries to run -- Indiana goes into a rage, ripping the mosquito netting from the bed as he fol- lows her. \nINDIANA No!  I've found it -- you can't -- Kali knows! \nWillie tries the door but it's locked.  She sees Indiana moving toward her ranting incoherently as he smashes a vase out of his way -- \nINDIANA -- been too many lies -- there's no god's heaven -- just -- the horror! I've seen it -- life preying on life! \nWillie cowers in a corner, horrified by the transformation she sees in Indiana.  Shouting and pacing Indy holds his head against the pain of his terrible thoughts -- \nINDIANA -- rivers -- destroying mountains -- a comet in space -- exploding! (holding his head) Aaahh! -- the screams -- pitiful people -- their pain -- the hate -- and greed -- always greed! \nThe light throws his shadow over Willie -- a giant shadow float- ing back and forth over her as she cries in the corner, unable to fight the evil devouring Indiana. \nINDIANA -- but I've found -- Kali's touch! Death -- no more lies -- the death I've been searching for! (shouting) Quit crying!  She can hear you -- Kali knows fear -- don't you under- stand -- Kali is freedom! \nIndiana stops pacing and Willie freezes in terror.  Now a bizarre yellow light wipes across the room.  Indiana turns and watches silently as two Thuggee guards emerge from a secret doorway that's opened -- \nThe shadows of the Thuggee guards loom over Willie and she SCREAMS again! \nCUT TO: \n133.   INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH - DAY                                133. \nWILLIE (Cont'd) No -- no! \nWillie cries is disbelief as Indiana calmly betrays her. \n140.   INT.  THE MINES BELOW                                          140. \nShort Round races up a tunnel and then flattens himself behind a corner.  He peers anxiously into a large carven and sees two guards walking away. \nWhen the coast is clear, Short Round darts across the cavern to a long wooden ladder tilted up against a wall.  Short Round looks up the high ladder and sees a kid with a sack of rocks descending from a burrow-hole half-way up the wall. \nThe exhausted kid nearly collapses at the bottom -- then jumps seeing Short Round.  Shorty motions for him to keep quiet. Amaxed, the kid watches Short Round scramble up the ladder. Shorty continues until he is high above the floor. \nDirty faces stare out of the high burrow as Short Round stops climbing.  The kids are astonished as Short Round suddenly grunts and kicks the ladder away from the wall! \nThe high ladder falls in an arc and what seem like sure suicide slowly resembles a mini-Indiana Junes stunt as Short Round swings to the other side of the falling ladder -- \nShort Round holds on for dear life as the ladder crashes against the opposite cavern wall -- giving Short Round access to the roof-hole that leads up to the temple! \nShort Round scurries up the ladder and pulls himself up into the chamber behind the altar.  He looks at the light flaring around the statue of Kali -- \nSHORT ROUND Indy -- ! \n141.   INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      141. \nChains clank and gears grind as the sacrificial frame is raised over the crevasse.  Stretched out on it, Willie looks horrified as she hangs suspended face down above the boiling lava! \nThe frame and victim descend slowly into the crevasse and the crowd around the little Maharajah changs louder. \n142.   INT.  THE REAR CHAMBER                                         142. \nShort Round dashes across the dark chamber behind the altar.  He peers out and sees Willie disappearing into the crewasse!  He sees Indiana watching impassively -- \nSHORT ROUND No -- Indy -- wake up! \nThen Shorty sees a flaming torch hanging on a wall bracket and he has an idea. \n143.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                143. \nShort Round suddenly darts out onto the altar and Mola Ram sees him and yells.  Several priests grab for Shorty.  He eludes the first priest, smashes the second in the stomach with his head, and runs like a little quarterback toward the fiery torch -- \nShort Round snatches the torch from the wall and charges toward Indiana.  Seeing him coming, Indy's eyes start glowing yellow and when Short Round runs up to him, Indiana suddenly swings and backhands the little guy brutally across the face! \nThe torch flies out of Shorty's hand as he's knocked against at wall by Indy's vicious blow -- Short Round wipes a little blood from his chin and stares at his hero in wounded disbelief. \nChattar Lal watches approvingly -- a priest moves toward Shorty. Chattar Lal looks back toward the crevasse -- \nWillie hangs on the lowering frame, heat waves rising up now to scald her skin and she chokes as the sulphuric air burns her lungs! \nMeanwhile Short Round is crawling backwards across the floor with a look of terror on his face -- Indiana stalks him, hissing, snarling, his eyes lgowing -- \nShort Round springs to his feet and tries to run -- Indy grabs him and pulls him -- Shorty's hand grabs for another wall torch and just manages to yank it free! \nIndiana spins Short Round and clutches his throat.  As Indy strangles him, Short Round struggles and finally jams the torch into Indy's side.  The fiery torch burns Indy, smoking as it sears his flesh, and he yells in pain. \nSHORT ROUND Wake up!  It's just a nightmare, Indy!  Wake up, please Indy! \nIndiana writhes in pain and Short Round sees the evil yellow glow in Indy's eyes getting dimmer and finally going out.  Now it seems like theold Indiana staring at him -- \nSHORT ROUND (Cont'd) Indy, you back? \nSuddenly a priest grabs Short Round and pulls him off Indiana. \nINDIANA No!  Give him to me! \nShort Round is firghtened as Indy grabs him from the priest. Indy lifts Short Round into the air -- \nSHORT ROUND No, Indy, no! \nHe sets Short Round down on the brink of the crevasse an inch from doom.  Shorty looks down at the lava and is terrified. Indiana finally flahses him a quick smile and winks! \nThen Indiana whirls and punches the priest in the face!  Short Round cheers, realizing that Indiana is back. \nSHORT ROUND (Cont'd) We got to help Willie! \nIndiana springs into action, stopping another priest with a quick punch in the stomach.  Then he rushes over to the crankwheel and pulley platform.  Indy jumps onto it, yanking one priest off who spills onto the floor. \nA second priest, who works the controls lowering the sacrificial frame, sees Indy and releases the crankwheel -- \nDown in the crevasse, Willie screams as the iron frame suddenly plummets toward the fulminating lava! \nOn the platform, the priest lunges at Indiana -- Indy uses the man's own momentum to throw him over his head.  Indy then dives for the crankwheel and manages to stop it -- \nDown in the crevasse, the fram jolts to a stop only yards above the spumes of fiery lava.  The heat is so intense now that Wil- lie's clothes start smoking and she passes out... On the platform above, Indiana cranks furiously, raising the sa- crificial frame. \n144.   INT.  THE TEMPLE                                               144. \nThe chanting stops at the Kali worshippers notice the battle on the altar.  The little Maharajah looks concerned and leaves, shoving through the crowd behind his bodyguards. \n145.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                145. \nMola Ram shouts at his priests and another one of them runs to- ward Indy on the platform.  Short Round dives and tackles the priest. \nChattar Lal finally leaps onto the crankwheel platform and Indy sees him pull a dagger.  He slashes at Indiana and Indy has to let go of the crankwheel -- the gears scream and the chains screech! \nFreed children scramble up numerous ladders to escape the mines below.  They follow the mass of children moving toward the front altar. \n152.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                152. \nOn the altar, under the statue of Kali, Willie and Short Round are helping Indy and some of the bigger children rip down a long wooden panel decorated with hideous Kali figures. \nThe childrens' escape is blocked by the chasm separating the altar from the deserted sorshippers' area of the temple.  The swelling crowds of children push and teeter dangerously on the edge of the fire pit. \nIndiana and the others carry the wooden panel through the crowd toward the chasm.  They stand it up and when Indy gives thw word they drop it -- \nThe panel crashes across the chasm forming a plank across which the children now begin running to safety. \n153.   INT.  BEHIND THE ALTAR                                         153. \nThe last of the children scramble up the ladders and run toward the front of the altar. \n154.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                154. \nThe childrens' bare feet stomp across the wooden plank -- below them the lava of the fire pit bubbles and shows outbursts of flame. \nIndy stares at the plank and sees that it's starting to smoke from the intese heat rising up. \nOn the far side of the plank, the children safely across scatter through the deserted temple toward freedom. \nWillie and Short Round help the last kids out onto the plank -- Indy sees one child's foot break though the smoldering wood -- the kid in front pulls the child to safety. \nWillie and Short Round start to go out onto the plank but Indy shouts at them -- \nINDIANA No, wait! \nHe runs over and pulls them aside -- he steps out onto the plank and takes a few steps to test it -- suddenly the plank bursts into flame in the middle. \nIndy takes one more step -- and then the plank breaks!  Indy dives back to the ledge of the altar and Willie and Short Round grab him and pull him up and the wooden plank plummets into the fiery chasm. \nWILLIE What're we going to do?! \nINDIANA There's got to be another way out. \nCUT TO: \n155.   INT.  A TUNNEL                                                 155. \nIndiana, Willie and Short Round run through the deserted mine tunnels.  They hear a rumbling noise and Indy leads them down a side tunnel.  They stop and peer into a quarry. \n156.   INT.  THE QUARRY CAVERN                                        156. \nA large cavern is the depository for the mine cars rolling in with loads of rock.  Emaciated children (still unaware of the re- volt and the other childrens' escape) break their backs shoving the heavily-loaded mine cars. \nThuggee guards supervise the deadening work, while others oper- ate the pulley-and-hoist system used to drag  the cars up the sloped dump ramp. \nBehind this operation, a thunderous waterfall cascades into a huge cistern.  From there, chutes deply the rushing water to power the large conveyor belt below it. \nAs the cars rise up the ramp, they tip and spill rocks onto the conveyor belt which carries them toward an awesome stone cylinder that rolls relentlessly , crushing the rocks into sand. \nFrom the side tunnel, Indiana watches the noisy operation. \nINDIANA Those empty cars have got to go out of the mines. \nWillie and Short Round watch the children push the empty mine cars.  The cars gain momentum and roll away down two dark tun- nels. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) Come on, let's see if we can catch a ride... \nTey duck out of the tunnel and run for cover behind a slag heap. Loaded mine cars roaring down from the mines hurtle past them and crash to a stop against the cars in front. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) Okay, Shorty -- go! \nHe pushes Short Round who darts out after a mine car roars past and dodges across the tracks before the next one descends.  Indy pushes Willie  into  position and holds her ready -- \nWILLIE I can't! \nINDIANA Go! \nAfter another car crashes past, Indy shoves her.  Willie runs out -- her shoe gets stuck and she freezes in the tracks!  Willie sees a rock-filled car blasting down out of a tunnel directly toward her! \nIndiana dives, knocking Willie safely to the ground on the other side of the tracks -- the heavy car hurtles past and crashes into the cars in front. \nIndy pulls Willie behind a massive wooden post holding up the dump ramp and they hide from a passing gaurd. \nINDIANA We've got to get across to the empty cars.  Wait here until I signal you. \nThey watch him run and hurdle a pile of lumber, bound up three steps and duck behind a tool shack on the platform.  Indy reaches out and grabs one of the passing slave children. \nThey see Indy put his hand over the kid's mouth and whisper to him.  He releases the kid who sneaks away, alerting the other children who start making their escapes into side tunnels. \nNow Indy motions to Short Rounds and Willie to follow.  As they start to move out they freeze dead in their tracks and Indy motions again angrily -- \nINDIANA Come on! \nWillie and Short Round see a guard coming up the steps on the other side of the platform.  As the man rises he gets taller and taller -- until they see it's a Thuggee giant coming up behind Indiana. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) Come one, what's wrong? \nSHORT ROUND Behind you! \nWILLIE Get down here, Shorty!  I got us a ride! \nWillie shirls as another quarry guard rushes toward her.  She yanks the iron brake-handle off the mine car and holds it threat- eningly like a baseball bat -- \nWILLIE (Cont'd) Come on, let's see hoe hand your head is! \nUp on the rock balcony, Short Round lowers himself over the edge. The little Maharajah grabs his arm -- \nMAHARAJAH Please -- listen -- to go out you must take the left tunnel. \nShorty looks at him and he knows he's telling the truth. \nSHORT ROUND Thanks pal. \nMAHARAJAH I'm going to try to find the English soldiers. \nSHORT ROUND Good luck. \nShort Round slips over the edge and slides down a wet stalactite to the floor of the cavern. \nThere he finds Willie swinging the brake-handle and smashing the guard in the gut.  The man doubles in pain -- Willie kicks his putt and he splashes into the pool of water. \nWILLIE I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry! \nSHORT ROUND Willie, come on! \nWillie starts pushing the empty mine car with Short Round. \nSHORT ROUND (Cont'd) You do pretty good for a girl! \nAcross the quarry, Mola Ram and six temple guards run out onto a high platform next to the waterfall.  Mola Ram sees Willie and Short Round pushing the mine cat. \nMola Ram shouts to his men -- two of them pull pistols and open fire! \nBullets ricochet off the mine car and Short Round shoves Willie to the far side of the car where they both take cover. \nMeanwhile, up on a catwalk, a guard slices a sword through the air and Indiana ducks!  The sword slashes into a wooden railing and the guard tries frantically to pull it out -- \nIndiana slams kis knee up into the guard's stomach and then smashes his fist down on his neck -- the man collapses.  Indy hears more gunfire. \nIndiana rushes along the catwalk toward the platform above.  He edges against the wall below the platform, staying out of sight as he unfurls his whip. \nOne of Mola Ram's guards fires again from the high platform and Indiana lashes the whip -- the whip wraps around the gunman's arm and Indy yanks on it -- \nThe gunman topples through the air and crashes down onto the cat- walk.  Indy grabs the gun.  He kicks the guard off the catwalk and the man falls into the waterfall pool. \nAs the other guards fire down at him, Indiana dodges along the catwalk and fires back at them.  A bullet explodes near Mola Ram and he ducks back -- \nMeanwhile, Short Round and Willie have the mine car rolling and they jump into it -- \nSHORT ROUND Indy!  Hurry! \nIndiana spots the rolling mine car racing across the quarry.  Indy takes off and runs along the catwalk -- bullets explode around him, splintering wood.  Indy reaches the end of the catwalk -- \nSuddenly he dives into the air and catches hold of a block and tacke!  Indy skids along the pulley system, sliding down a cable toward the mine car in which Short Round and Willie are riding. \nBullets whiz past as Indiana sails in the air above the speeding mine car - when they are in sync, Indy lets go and drops into the mine car next to Willie and Short Round! \nMola Ram rushes forward and watches the speeding mine car rolling down the track toward the tunnels -- \nMOLA RAM They've stolen the Sankara Stones -- they must be stopped! \nIn the speeding  mine car, Indy sees the tracks separating in two directions -- one back into the quarry, the other toward two tun- nels that lead out of the mines. \nIndiana lifts a shovel from the floor of the car and swings it just in time -- he hits a switch which CLANGS as they speed by and the car is shunted tipsy-turvy onto the track toward the two tunnels. \nWillie hangs on as the car tears down the track toward the tunnel on the right -- and Short Round looks worried -- \nSHORT ROUND No, Indy, it's left tunnel. \nBut it's too late and they all hold on as the mine car shoots donw into the darkness of the echoing tunnel. \n157.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               157. \nThe wind rushes past Indiana as the car descends into the tunnel and picks up speed.  Willie hangs on with Short Round -- the mine car roars around a curve and flies fater along the rails. \n158.   INT.  THE QUARRY                                               158. \nBack in the quarry, Mola Ram supervises the guards as they shove empty cars toward the tunnel.  Carrying long Khyber rifles, they jump aboard the cars.  The first one rolls into the dark tunnel and the second car speeds after it. \n159.   INT.  THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE                                      159. \nThe two Thuggee cars shoot past, descending into the darkness in pursuit of the infidels who stole the Sankara Stones. \n160.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               160. \nThe mine car hurtles past.  Indy sits in front, pulling back on the brake-lever to control their speed and keep them from careen- ing off the tracks. \nExpecting trouble, Short Round peers over the back end of the car.  Willie ducks low, watching the heavy beams flashing danger- ously close above their heads. \nThen Willie's eyes go wide and she groans in terror like a girl on a roller coaster as the mine car suddenly plunges downward, taking their stomachs with it. \nA gunshot rings out and Short Round sees the first Thuggee car appear around a curve behind them.  Mola Ram's gunmen start blasting.  Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Indy yells back to Short Round. \nThe sledgehammers continue -- until two of the rock supports give way!  There are shouts as the guards run for cover. \nMola Ram stands on a platform watching the huge cistern slowly keel over -- the noise is incredible as the colossal tank crashes to the ground! \nSuddenly a half-million gallons of water explode across the cav- cern and surge in a tidal wave toward the tunnels! \n168.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               168. \nThe walls of the tunnel flash past and curves appear suddenly out of the darkness as the hair-raising chase continues -- \nShort Round and Willie struggle to help Indy lift a large boulder from the bottom of the speeding mine car. \nThe cars descend again into a stretch of much lower tunnel where the beams flash past inches above them.  Indy judges the beams -- \nINDIANA Okay  -- one -- two -- NOW! \nAll three of them groan as they raise the boulder and shove it off the back of the car -- ducking instantly to avoid being de- capitated by the next beam! \nLooking back, they see the gunmen pop up between the beams -- and they see the looks of terror on the gunmen's faces as they see the boulder in front of them! \nThe Thuggee car hits the boulder and upends!  The guards scream horribly as the car tumbles end over end, slamming against the tunnel walls, getting ripped to shreds so that finally only pieces of metal, wheels and debris fly like a meteorite shower down the tunnel! \nWillie whoops for joy and hugs Indy who smiles modestly -- \nINDIANA Okay, Shorty, hit the brakes! \nShort Round dives for the front of the car and ahppily pulls the brake lever -- it doesn't work!  Short Round yanks on it harder -- the brake level suddenly breaks off! \nSHORT ROUND Indy!! \nIndy sees Short Round holding up the broken brake lever!  Indy crawls quickly toward Shorty while Willie holds on for dear life! \nCompletely out of control, the car hurtles down a decline into a section where the tunnel if larger again -- \nIndiana bends over the front of the car and looks underneath.  He sees the brake tension hanging loose from the brake-pad.  Indiana pulls himself back up and looks at Willie and Short Round. \nINDIANA Grab onto me -- I'm going to try and slow us down from underneath! \nWillie looks terrified but helps Short Round grab onto Indy's arm and the back of his jacket.  He skips over the front of the car and swings a leg underneath -- \nIndy is inches above the rails and the rocky ground blurring be- neath the car as he tries to kick at the brake-pad.  His feet fall and he bumps along, dragged dangerously for a moment -- \nIndy manages to find a foothold on the undercarriage of the car. As they hold onto him, Indy kicks again and his foot hits the brake-pad.  He shoves it and slowly the pad closes against the spinning wheel... \nWILLIE Oh no! \nWillie and Short Round look up and see that the tunnel is ending ahead and the track dead-ends into a stone wall! \nINDIANA What's wrong? \nHe looks around -- and sees the car rocketing directly toward the stone wall! \nIndy's foot starts kicking in high-gear underneath the car -- he slams at the brake-pad with all his strength -- the pad screeches against the spinning wheeel and starts sparking! \nThe car seems to slow as it shoots toward the end of the tunnel. Indy groans and pushes hard against the smoking brake-pad. \nThe car slows more and more until it runs down the last few yards to the dead-end and rolls gently to a stop, just nudgeing Indy's back against the wall.... \nINDIANA Ouch... \nWillie looks faint as Indiana gets to his feet and Shorty jumps out of the car.  They help Willie out and she stands shakily -- \nWILLIE I'm okay -- I'm fine -- I love to flirt with death... \nIndiana sees that the tunnel ahead continues without any more tracks.  Then they hear something -- \nA strange rumbling sound echoing down the tunnel from behind them.  The walls seem to reverberate.  Looking worried, they start walking away down the tunnel. \nThey walk faster as the noise behind them becomes louder and they keep glancing over their shoulders -- \nWILLIE What's that?...Indy?! \nIndiana isn't sure and he pulls Willie by the arm and all three of them start jogging. \nThe rumbling behind them sounds increasingly ominous and finally they start running full tilt.  They rush down the tunnel and the awful noise becomes defening!  Willie looks around again and slows suddenly -- \nWillie stops dead in her tracks -- paralyzed -- awestruck -- DOOMED! \nWillie sees a monster wall of water (released from the quarry) as it thunders around a curver -- a mammoth tidal wave crashing spec- tacularly against the opposite tunnel wall! \nA veritable \"tsunami\" caroming off the tunnel wall and spewing furiously forward like a hydrous Juggernaut! \nWILLIE (frozen in her tracks) Oh... shit... \nIndiana and Short Round notice that Willie's sloed and they stop running -- they also see the cataclysm of water crashing down the tunnel toward them. \nIndy runs back and grabs Willie.  All three of them take off, running faster than they've ever run in their lives! \nThe tidal wave smashes forward, booming behind them and Indiana realizes quickly that they're going to lose this race.  Suddenly he sees a small side-tunnel in a bend ahead -- \nINDIANA There!  Dive! \nThey lunge toward the hole and Short Round dives in it first. Indiana shoves Willie into the hole and jumps in after her just as the colossal tidal wave explodes  past! \n", "test1_input": "LAO You fool! \nWILLIE Ow, you're hurting me, you miser- able little hood! \nINDIANA Let go of her, Lao.  And give me the antidote. \nLao just laughs evilly -- until a waiter moves up behind Lao and the crimelord suddenly stiffens.  He lets go of Willie's wrist and raises his hands off the table.  Chen stops collecting the money and jewels. \nKao Kan tenses and Indy smiles at Wu Han, the Chinese waiter with the scar, who is standing behind Lao.  Wu Han has a towel over his hand  --  under it, he has a pistol pressed against Lao's spine. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) (smiling at Wu Han) I like the service here. \nWILLIE (puzzled) Hey, he's not a waiter... \nINDIANA No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along. (to Lao) So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao. \nLao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass vial of liquid next to the cash, gold, jewels, poison and sacred box. Indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial of antidote -- then he hears a muffled report!  And another! \nWu Han groans and sways.  Indy starts to stand but Chen immedi- ately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that he used to kill Wu Han -- Indy sees it pointed at him now and he remains in his seat. \nKao Kan stands and grabs Wu Han, easing the phoney waiter into the chair he just vacated.  The muffled shooting hasn't attracted any attention.  The nightclub activity continues an Indy speaks emotionally to his dying friend. \nINDIANA Wu Han  --  listen to me  --  I'm going to get you out of here. \nIn pain, Wu Han looks at Indy and struggles to speak -- \nWU HAN Not this time, my friend... (smiling bravely) I followed you on many adventures -- but into the great Unknown Mystery, I go first, Indy... \nWu Han dies and slumps forward.  Indiana is shattered by the death of his old friend. \nLAO Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you will soon join him. \nIndy's gaze shifts from his dead friend to Lao's sneering face. Then Indy sees the murderous Chen giggling perversely.  Indy's anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut and his vis- ion of Chen's ugly face blurs into a double image -- \nIndy stands up unsteadily.  Chen assumes he's about to keel over from the poison -- but Indy suddenly turns and grabs a real wai- ter at another table.  The waiter holds a long skewer of roasted pigeons that he's just set afire -- \nIndy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambee and hurls is across the table!  Chen fires and misses -- and screams as the skewer stabs into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front of his hor- rified face! \nThis the other tables definitely notice.  There are screams and all hell breaks loose.  Indiana shoves past Willie and reaches for the vial on the table -- \nINDIANA The antidote -- ! \nBut he's grabbed from behind by Kao Kan.  Indy elbows the punk, reaches back and grabs his head -- and somersaults Kao Kan onto the table! \nAs nubmer two son crashes into the table, the impact sends the Emperor Nurhachi's ashes billowing into Lao's stricken face! \nIndiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across the table -- and falling! \nIndiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits the floor -- then Indy's hand is brutally stomped on by one of Lao's henchmen and the vial rolls away. \nIndiana angrily raises his head, smashing it up into the hench- man's groin -- the man howls like a banshee and hobbles away. \nMeanwhile, Willie watches Lao grabbing for cash from the table. Willie lunges past the pigeon-skewered Chen to snatch the jewels, but unfortunately Kao Kan knocks them off the table as he leaps to attack Indy. \nIndiana scrambles on his hands and knees after the rolling vial. People keep kicking it -- he almost has it when Willie runs into him, trips and lands on her back. \nINDIANA Look out, damn it, I need that antidote! \nWILLIE Who cares?  Where's that diamond! \nGunfire explodes and they both scramble in different directions. Indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons and slides be- hind a water-spewing fountain.  Water kicks up as Indy is shot at by Lao and his henchmen. \nIndy sees the vial of antidote kicked again and it spins across the marble floor -- feeling the poison, Indy shakes his head groddily and splashes water on his face. \nMeanwhile, Willie is chasing her diamond, shoving through the panicked crowd.  She spots the diamond!  Another elegantly dresses soman is bending to pick it up -- \nWILLIE (acidly polite) Excuse me, but I believe that's my diamond! \nWillie smiles and suddenly kicks the woman in the butt!  Willie reaches to get the diamond but not before the other woman tackles her. \nBehind the fountain, Indiana makes a break -- he runs and dives on top of a serving cart.  The wheeled cart hurtles toward an un- suspecting gunman, crashes into him from behind and sends him flying head first into a row of ice buckets. \nNearby, Willie slugs the other lady in the jaw and grabs for the elusive diamond just as the ice buckets showers ice across the floor -- which camouflages the diamond! \nWILLIE Aw nuts! \nSearching desperately for the jewel, Willie sees the vial of antidote spinning across the floor --as it slides by, she grabs it. \nINDIANA (O.S.) Hey,doll!  Don't move! \nShe sees Indy speeding by atop the serving cart.  Lao and his gunmen rush out to block the way.  Indy rolls off the cart and slides behind a potted palm as Lao's men open fire again. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) (shouting to Willie) Hey, don't go away!  I need that! \nWillie smiles meanly as she slips the vial down the front of her dress, thumbs her nose at Indiana and walks away. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) If I wasn't dying, I'd kill her... \nHiding behind the palm tree, Indiana looks around and spots a gi- ant statue at the side of the stage.  Indy makes a break for it. \nAs the gunmen open fire, Indy springs onto a chair -- jumps onto a table -- and leaps onto the stage.  He grabs the golden broad- sword from the Chinese warrior statue! \nAs bullets smash into the statue, Indiana hides behind it.  Then he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous brass gong. \n", "test1_true": "The giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble steps.  Indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls across the dance floor. \nUsing the gong as an enormous shield, Indy evades the gunfire ex- ploding -- bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as Indy runs behind it. \nAhead, Willie hurries toward an exit -- she hears something and turns -- her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing down on her! \nWillie yells as Indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the gong with him -- \nLao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to get better firing positions -- and more henchmen come into the club now and start firing machine guns! \nAs bullets clang against the gong, Indiana and Willie run behind it.  Willie hollers as they head directly for a towering, floor- to-ceiling window! \nIndiana grabs Willie around the waist and, after the huge gong crashes through the stained-glass window, they both fly after it! \n6.     EXT.  \"THE DRAGON\" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                           6. \nIn a shower of sparkling glass, the enormous gong sails out and crashes down a sloping green-tiled roof.  Indiana Jones and Wil- lie Scott hurtle into the night air after it! \nThe gong rolls down the roof and they hit the tiles behind it, Indiana holding onto Willie as they roll one-over-the-other toward the edge -- Willie screams as they fall into thin air! \nTheir entwined bodies plummet three stories:  ripping through a third-floor awning, crashing through an old man's mattress on a second-floor balcony -- \nFinally they smash through the convertible top of a parked Duesen- berg and fall into the back seat! \n7.     INT.  THE DUESENBERG                                           7. \nWillie sits up wide-eyed, speechless and amazed to be alive. Then she sees an equally astonished Short Round looking at them from the front seat. \nSHORT ROUND Wow!  Holy smoke!  Crash landing! \nINDIANA Step on it, Short Round! \nSHORT ROUND Okey doke, Indy!  Hold onto your potatoes! \nThe twelve-year-old Chinese kid turns his baseball cap bill- backwards and steps on the gas!  The tires squeal as the car roars off -- \nWILLIE For crying out loud, a kid's driv- ing the car?! \nINDIANA Relax, I've been giving him lessons. \n8.     EXT.  THE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                                    8. \nThe Duesenberg races past the entrace to the nightclub as Lao and his man rush out and jump into two black sedans.  The sedans screech off in pursuit of the Duesenberg. \n9.     INT.  THE DUESENBERG                                           9. \nAs Short Round eagerly swerves around a corner, Willie holds on for dear life.  Indiana suddenly puts his hand down the front of Willie's dress -- \nWILLIE Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of gril! \nINDIANA Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote? \nIndiana withdraws his hand, having finally found the vial.  He opens is quickly, tips the vial to his lips and grimaces as he swallows the stuff. \nWILLIE You don't look very good. \nINDIANA Poison never agrees with me. (shouting forward) Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge! \nSHORT ROUND Check!  Gotcha! \nAs the car accelerates, Indy peers out the back window at their pursuers.  Willie notices her reflection in the side window -- \nWILLIE Look at what you've done to me! I'm a mess!  My lipstick's smeared, I broke two nails, I've got an aw- ful run in my stocking -- ! \nGunfire suddenly explodes, bullets whizz through the canvas top and the rear window shatters and sprays glass!  Willie ducks and cringes terrified in the corner -- \nINDIANA Somehow I think you've got bigger problems. \nIndy grabs his shoulder bag and pulls a pistol out of it.  He pokes the gun through the broken window and starts firing back at their pursuers -- then he turns and looks ahead. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) There, Shorty!  Through the tunnel! \nThrough the windows we see the car racing into a tunnel.  Lights from the pursuing cars flash through the rear window and gunfire echoes in the tunnel. \nWILLIE What're we going to do?!  Where're we going?! \nINDIANA The airport...No, look out, Short Round!  Left, left! \nIndy reaches over the front seat and helps Short Round navigate. \n10.    EXT.  A SHANGHAI SQUARE - NIGHT                                10. \nThe Duesenberg tears around the square, followed by Lao's two se- dans.  People on the street dive for cover -- coolies pulling rickshaws go into hyper-jov --lanterns spanning the street crash down and are dragged behind the Duesenberg.  Bullets exlode and amazed prostitutes watch the cars zoom past. \n11.    INT.

You, me and Wu Han -- \nShorty throws an envelope back and Indy looks at the three tickets. \n", "test1_id": 1851, "test2_input": "CHATTAR LAL Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century. \nCAPT. BLUMBURTT Of course.  The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices.  The Brit- ish Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857. \nShort Round avoids the dinner by feeding it to his little monkey as he listens to the scary conversation. \nThe talk is bad enough, but Willie finds the food unbelievable! A servant leans overher shoulder and places a six-inch long BUG on her plate! \nWillie whimpers quietly as she watches the fat merchant next to her lift one of the black, shiny baked-beetles -- and crack it in two!  The man proceeds to enthusiastically suck the gooey innards out. \nMERCHANT (looking at Willie) But you're not eating! \nWILLIE (weakly) I uh -- had bugs for lunch. \nMeanwhile, Indiana continues to politely needle Chattar Lal. \nINDIANA I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard. \nCHATTAR LAL There are no stories anymore. \nINDIANA Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peas- ants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- becuase of some ancient evil. \nIndiana smiles and shrugs. \nCHATTAR LAL (sneeringly) Their stories are just fear and folklore. \nINDIANA (cooly) Maybe.. but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace? \nIndy catches a glance between the little Maharajah and the prime minister, who answers slowly -- \nCHATTAR LAL The local peasants are just as superstitious.  You're very ob- servant, Dr. Jones.  But you're beginning to worry Capt. Blum- burtt. \nBlumburtt's phlegmatic attitude has changed to curiosity. \nCAPT. BLUMBURTT I'm not worried, Prime Minister, just interested. \nDuring their conversation, Willie listens to beetles SNAPPING and she watches revolted as the other dinner guests suck the gooey insides out of the bugs. \nWILLIE (to Short Round) Give me your hat... \nSHORT ROUND What for? \nWILLIE I'm going to puke in it... \nMeanwhile, Indy continues ingenously with Chattar Lal. \nINDIANA You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them. \nCHATTAR LAL Dr. Jones, it our country a guest does not usually insult his host. \nINDIANA Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore. \nCAPT. BLUMBURTT (trying to make peace) I'm sure it's nothing.  Just ru- mors. (but interested) What was it they claimed was stolen? \nINDIANA Something magical.  A sacred rock. \nCHATTAR LAL (condescendingly) There, you see, Captain.  A rock! \nINDIANA When they lost this rock their fields and animals dies.  They also said their children were taken from them. \nCHATTAR LAL I think that's enough  of this nonsense, Dr. Jones... \nIndiana smiles faintly at Chattar Lal's anger.  Across the table, Willie looks pale and motions to the waiter. \nWILLIE So you have something, you know, simple -- like soup or something? \nThe servant goes off and returns with a covered bowl.  He uncov- ers it and Willie looks at a soup with a dozen eyeballs floating in it. \nMERCHANT Looks delicious! \nWILLIE I wanna go home... \nWillie whimpers and tears start down her cheeks. \nINDIANA (to Chattar Lal) I was dubious muself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones... \nCHATTAR LAL (controlling himself) Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors.  I seem to re- member that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist. \nINDIANA (shrugging) The newspapers exaggerated the incident \nCHATTAR LAL And didn't the Sultan of Madagas- car threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his coun- try? \nINDIANA That was a misunderstanding. \nCHATTAR LAL (smiling) Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones. \nMAHARAJAH I have heard the terrible stories of the evil Thuggee cult... \nWhen the little Marahajah speaks it surprises everyone and there is silence. \nMAHARAJAH (Cont'd) I thought the stories were told to frighten children.  Later, I learned that the Thuggee cult was once real and did unspeakable things. \nThe Marahajah looks at Indiana. \n", "test2_true": "INDIANA (after a moment) I'm sorry if I've offended you. \nNow, more trays are whisked in by servants. \nMERCHANT Ah, dessert! \nShort Round's monkey suddenly screeches and takes off.  Willie closed here eyes in dread - but curiosity gets the best of her and she looks -- it's worse than she could imagine: \nPlates full of small, dead monkey heads!  (*Production note: be- cause of his extremely sensitive nature, the director has reque- ted that these monkey heads be simulated). \nThe tops of the monkey's skulls have been cut off and sit loose like little covers.  Willie watches in utter dismay as the Maha- rajah and his guests remove the skull-tops and start dipping spoons into what's inside -- \nMERCHANT (Cont'd) Chilled monkey brains! \nWillie keels over, crashing backwards in a dead faint! \nCUT TO: \n62.

THE PELASURE GARDEN - NIGHT                              63. \nHundreds of lanters illuminate the garden where after dinner drinks are served, cigars lighted and hookah pipes puffed on. \nIndiana comes out of the pavilion into the garden with Capt. Blumburtt and they talk quietly. \nCAPT. BLUMBURTT Rather bizarre menu, woundn't you say? \nINDIANA Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat. (looking around) Makes you wonder what these people are... \nNow, the little Maharajah comes over with his retinue and he reaches for Indy's whip which Short Round is carrying. \nMAHARAJAH I have seen this thing.  What is it, Dr. Jones? \nSHORT ROUND Hey, nobody touches Indy's whip! \nShort Round grabs for it, but Indiana restrains him. \nINDIANA We're guests here, Shorty. \nThe Maharajah glares are Short Round and five the whip to Indy. \nMAHARAJAH You will show me how it works please. \nIndy bows to the little prince and smiles ironically -- \nINDIANA You wish is my command, your Highness. \nWhile Short Round watches angrily, Indiana walks across the gar- den and unfurls the whip.  Indy sees a servant lighting a candle. \nSuddenly the whip flies and CRACKS like a pistol shot.  The candle disappears!  Indiana whirls and CRACKS the whip again, snagging a flower out of a dancing girl's hair. \nThe Maharajah reacts like any kid -- he shoops happily. \nMAHARAJAH That is wonderful!  Please teach me how! \nShort Round sulks as he listens to Indiana instructing the Maha- rajah on how to hold the whip.  As the young prince practises the grip, Indy notices Chattar Lal slip behind a fountain to talk to a dark figure in robes who appears. \nIndiana sees Chattar Lal bow to the dark figure -- and Indy catches a glimpse of the stranger's pale face and dark hollow eyes.  Then the robled apparition seems to disappear. \nMeanwhile everyone watches respectfully as the Maharajah unfurls the whip for his first attempt.  He flings the whip but it flies back and snaps  -- biting his own  cheek. \nThere's a stunned silence -- then Short Round laughs  at the little prince who is holding his wounded cheek.  The incensed Ma- rahajah suddenly flashes the whip as Short Round. \nShort Round grabs the end of it and pulls hard -- the whip is tugged taut between the two hostile boys.  As they draw near each other, Short Round sees something weird: \nThe little Maharajah's eyes begin glowing yelloe and he hisses softly in a strange voice.  Nobody else sees or hears the bizarre transformation... \nIndiana finally intercedes -- he grabs Short Round by the neck. \nINDIANA Okay, Short Round, let go of it. \nShort Round lets go and Indy gently takes the whip back from the little prince. \nINDIANA (Cont'd) The Turks say that a whip can be an enemy even to its owner.  If you get some rope, it'll be easier to learn with, your Highness. Now, I think we'll say goodnight. \nThe Maharajah and Short Round stare hostiley at each other as Indy recoils his whip. \nCUT TO: \n64.    INT.  A PALACE HALL - NIGHT                                    64. \nShort Round walks beside Indiana down the shadowy hall toward their room.  Short Round has Indy's whip curled around his shoul- der.  The little fellow yawns and shakes his head. \nSHORT ROUND That little Maharajah think he big stuff. \nINDIANA You don't like him do you? \nSHORT ROUND Next time I flatten him!  Did you see his eyes? \nINDIANA No. \n", "test2_id": 1852, "test3_input": "Mola Ram motions and the guards move farther out on both sides of the bridge -- suddenly Indiana swings the sword and it cuts into one of the bottom rope-spans! \nThe rope is half-severed and frays slowly under the tension! \nMOLA RAM Impressive, Dr. Jones. But I don't believe you would kill yourself! \nMola Ram motions again the his guards (looking more nervous now) step farther out onto the bridge, mvoing closer to Indy from both sides. \nIndy swings the sword again, cutting into the other rope-span! It, too, is now partially severed and frays slowly.  The bridge jolts and Indy and the guards sway precariously! \nSuddenly Mola Ram shoves Short Round out onto the bridge.  The High Priest draws a dagger and pushes Willie onto the swaying span, holding the knife behind them both. \nMOLA RAM (Cont'd) Your friends will die with you! \nIn different times this would be called a Mexican stand-off Indiana looks at the guards in front and behind him.  He sees Willie and Short Round out on the bridge now with Mola Ram at their backs. \nINDIANA Then I guess we're all going to take a big dive! \nIndy and Short Round's eyes meet -- and the kid realizes that his hero isn't kidding.  Willie looks at Shout Round anxiously -- she notices that Shorty is surreptitiously wrapping his foot around a rope support. \nPetrified, Willie also secretly wraps her foot around a rope and does likewise with her arm -- \nMOLA RAM Give me the stones! \nINDIANA Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell! \nIndiana swings the sword with all his might -- it whooshes through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom ropes --! \nImmediately Mola Ram's guards start to flee in panic -- too late! Indiana swings the sword again and the two ropes on the other side are severed -- \nThe rope bridge is sheared in two!  It breaks in the middle and both halves fall apart!  The guards scream horribly in the air as they plunge down into the rocky gorge! \nWillie and Short Round cling to their established footholds and fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge.  Mola Ram spills forward, clutching desperately at the ropes and slats -- \nBelow them, Indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically now, dang- ling from its moorings at the top. \nThere's an instant of suspended animation as all who remain alive realize they are alive.  Short Round and Willie cling near the top of the now vertical bridge. \nBelow them, Mola Ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear life. \nShort Round and Willie struggle upwards, clutching ropes and stepping on slats.  Finally, Short Round heaves himself up onto solid ground and turns to help Willie up. \nMeanwhile, dangling below on the bridge, Indy reaches up and grabs Mola Ram's leg.  The High Priest kicks and tries to break Indy's grip.  He kicks again and smashes Indy in the face. \nIndy won't let go.  Suddenly the High Priest reaches up and grabs his own Thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his shirt -- \nMola Ram shoves the luckless guard down onto Indy, trying to dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming Thuggee.  Indy manages to hang on.  The Thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming to his death. \nThen Mola Ram looks across the gorge and yells.  Indy sees a dozen of the last Thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel -- only to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge. \nIndy starts climbing up after Mola Ram again.  He grabs at the back of Mola Ram's robe and pull him down.  Slipping, Mola Ram turns and it's Indy's chance to punch Mola Ram in the face. \nMola Ram's eyes are glowing yellow and he's shouting incoherent- ly.  He grabs the strap of Indy's shoulder bag and stamps on In- dy's hand -- Indy falls! \nIndiana slips downward, scrambling to catch hols of something -- meanwhile, Mola Ram now has the bag with the Sankara Stones. \nIndy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously near the bottom of the bridge. \nAcross the gorge, the Thuggee guards run up a path to a small gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge.  The guards have bows and arrows and take firing positions -- \nAt the top of the bridge, Mola Ram keeps climbing until rocks start poundinghim from above -- Willie and Short Round pely him with rocks which he tries to block with his arm. \nIndiana starts to climb again, using all his strength.  He reaches for a wooden slat -- suddenly a flaming arrow smashes into the wood! \nIndy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing across the chasm directy for him! \nAcross the gorge, by the grove of trees, a Thuggee priest yells orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming arrows. \nIndiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the continu- ing bursts of fiery arrows.  At the top, Mola Ram reaches up des- perately for a hand old -- Willie smashes his hand with a rock! \nThe High Priest yells in pain and slips down to where Indy slugs him again in the face!  They struggle as the fire burns up from beneath them. \nOn the cliff above the fallen bridge, Willie watches the fire rising toward Indy and Mola Ram as they fight.  Short Round turns and sees something -- \nSHORT ROUND Willie, look! \nThey see horses galloping through a narrow pass -- the British cavalry is returning.  Captain Blumburtt and the first troops draw up their forses and dismount quickly. \nA fussilade of flaming arrows force the British to take cover -- they quickly start firing back at the Thuggees with rifles. \nAs the battle above the gorge continues, Indy and Mola Ram fight below on the dangling bridge -- \nIndiana sees the High Priest's eyes begin glowing and he hisses insanely.  Mola Ram's hand thrusts out toward Indiana's chest and Indy yells in pain -- \nIndy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Ram's hand starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's chest during the temple sacrifice)! \nMola Ram's finger are inching into Indy's body --  Indy clutches at Mola Ram's piercing hand, trying to keep the deadly fingers away from his heart. \nSlowly, Indy is able to push Mola Ram's hand away and his fingers withdraw from Indy's chest.  Indiana suddenly slugs the High Priest in the face and grabs for the bag of Sankara Stones -- \nMOLA RAM No, the stones are mine! \nINDIANA You're betrayed Shiva. *(He re- peats in Sanskrit Sankara's warn- ing) \n", "test3_true": "INDIANA (Cont'd) *(He repeats Sankara's warning in Sanskrit) \nThe blazing stones sear Mola Ram's flesh and he screams in pain. The light suddenly dies in his eyes and for one instant he looks at Indy as if awakened from a nightmare -- \nMola Ram loses his balance and Indy grabs for the stones.  He manages to clutch only one of them as Mola Ram screams and falls! \nIndy sees the stone in his hand suddenly cool.  He watches Mola Ram plummeting downward into the chasm and finally crashing into the jagged rocks at the bottom. \nThe irritated crocodiles are disturbed once more -- but soon wel- come the meal that just dropped in.  Jaws flash and teeth rip at the High Priest's likeless corpse. \nAnd Indy's bag with the Sankara Stones sinks into the murkly cur- rent and disappears down the river ... \n173.   EXT.

They pull him up onto the cliff and they all look around exhausted -- \nAcross the gorge, more British troops emerge from the mine tun- nels to subdue the remaining Thuggee guards on that side. \nFinally the little Maharajah comes out of the dark mine tunnel. He sees Short Round across the gorge -- and bows to thank him for his help.  On the other side, Short Round waves his cap, saluting him back. \nWillie stands at the edge of the gorge looking down into the riv- er far below. \nWILLIE I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted. \nINDIANA Not quite. \nShe sees Indy reach into his pocket.  He pulls something out slowly -- as she watches he reveals a crystal stone -- \nINDIANA (Cont'd) The last Sankara Stone. \nShort Round watches Willie take it carefully from Indiana.  She gazes at it and looks delighted -- \nWILLIE And the diamond hidden inside... \nWillie holds the stone up to the sun and it sparkles and flashes \nCUT TO \n174.   EXT.

Behinf them we see more smaller silhouettes appearing over the rise. \nIndiana, Willie and Short Round walk back down the dirt road into Mayapore -- followed by a multitude of children returning to their homeland. \nWillie looks at the changed landscape and seems astonished:  the barren countryside has been reborn.  They see streams flowing beneath green trees, flowers blooming and peasants harvesting golden grain in the fields. \n175.   EXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE                                         175. \nIndiana, Willie and Short Round lead the children down the village road.   Ahead they see villagers rebuilding their primi- tive dwellings. \nNow they hear shouts of joy from the peasants.  The children returning home start running to meet their parents who are rush- ing out to greet them. \nThere is laughter and tears as families are reunited.  Indiana sees the old shaman approaching with the chieftain and the village elders. \nThe shaman touches his fingers to his forehead and bows.  The three travelers return his greeting and the shaman is quite moved as he speaks to Indiana -- \nSHAMAN We know you are coming back -- (indicating the countryside) -- when life returns to our village. \nWILLIE It's a real miracle. \nSHAMAN Now you see the magic of the \"rock\" you bring back. \nThe old shaman smiles wisely at Indiana.  Indy takes the stone out of his bag and unwraps it. \nINDIANA Yes, I've seen its power \nWillie watches the shaman take it reverently and bow to them. The shaman joins the elders and they walk to the village's small sacred mound.  Indy and Willie stay back.  They see him kneel and replace the stone in its niche. \nINDIANA The last Sankara Stone. \nWILLIE And they don't even know what it really is. \nINDIANA (smiling at her) Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond. \nWILLIE You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've got- ten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about. \nINDIANA It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen. \nShe looks at him like he's crazy. \nWILLIE Oh no, I'm finding a native guide who knows the way.  No more de- tours for me, thank you Dr. Jones. \nShe turns and starts walking away continuing to complain -- \nWILLIE (Cont'd) If you think I'm going to Delhi or anyplace else with you, after all the trouble you've gotten me into... \nSuddenly the bullwhip CRACKS and wraps around her waist.  Star- tled Willie looks angry as Indiana reels her in, pulling her to- ward him and into his arms.  But when he finally kisses her, she doesn't seem to mind at all... \nShort Round shakes his head, but looks sort of pleased.  When he turns away, his face lights up! \nShort Round runs toward the sunset, toward the three elephants being brought back to the village.  The baby elephant starts walking faster, as if he recognizes Short Round running out to meet him... \nTHE END \n", "test3_id": 1853}

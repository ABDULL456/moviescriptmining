This is a check for ten grand- \nHe holds up his hand. \nCLAY We're not mercenaries. \nAISHA Operational capital, that's all. (holding out the check) You've been waiting three years for a shot at this guy. You're not gonna get another. You want Max, this is it. He takes it. She hands him some papers along with it. \nAISHA (CONT'D) Intel on the shipment. You check it out, you check me out, you decide - are you in or not? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MEXICO - BEACH CAMPSITE - NIGHT \nCOUGAR chilling by a small fire. Working his way through a bottle of tequila. His blackberry rings... \nINT. VIRGINIA MOTEL - NIGHT \nPOOCH in a Motel 6 Laying in bed alone, watching an old Jimmy Stewart movie. Blackberry rings... INT. ARIZONA MOTEL - MOTEL \nJENSEN's in bed with TWO GIRLS from his spin class. Blackberry rings... \nTIGHT ON THE THREE BLACKBERRY MESSAGES: \nNOW THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO \nEXT. DELHI, INDIA - MIDDAY \nThe city midday is UTTERLY PACKED. Overflowing. The capital of the next great Superpower. Delhi, India. \nINT. DELHI, INDIA - OFFICE TOWER \nA TOP FLOOR OFFICE SUITE of a high end technology company. Degrees on the walls. A Bollywood musical BLARES from a TV loud enough to cover up the SOUNDS OF BEGGING... \nTHREE INDIAN SCIENTISTS -- A short guy, a tall guy, and a really fat guy -- On the floor, BOUND, terrified, looking up at a tough looking bastard standing over them -- \nWADE. Our burly man from the safe-house. Now he works for the suit in the brown French club chair. The Big Man, Master of Disaster, Trouble on a Firestick... MAX. \nSHORT SCIENTIST You know we cannot do this... We cannot do what you ask... \nMAX Tell me - is this a moral issue or a financial issue? \nFAT SCIENTIST A moral issue. \nMAX (ACTUALLY CURIOUS) Really? You object morally to this deal? \nFAT SCIENTIST Yes. I'm sorry. Please leave... \nMax takes a moment. Thinks. MAX Okay, here's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing \"No.\" I'm hearing \"Leave,\" and I'm hearing \"I'm sorry.\" Is that what I'm hearing? \nFAT SCIENTIST Please... you must leave... \nMax nods to himself. He thought so. \nMAX Right. Okay, so that is what I'm hearing. Now, I want you to listen. Listen carefully because I want you to hear this. Wade? \nWade hauls him up the FAT SCIENTIST. Without hesitation, he walks him over to the large glass window looking down FIFTY THREE STORIES above Delhi and HURLS HIM OUT... \nEXPLODING through the glass. As the poor bastard FALLS AND SCREAMS... The other scientists scream at the sight. Max turns to Wade, bewildered: \nMAX (CONT'D) What the hell was that? \nWADE You gave me the nod. \nMAX A \"hit him in the face\" nod, not a \"throw him out the window\" nod. \nWADE I thought that's what you wanted. \nMAX At most--at most that was a \"break his fingers\" nod. (slams his fist) I mean Jesus, Wade, the man was scientific genius. Granted his weight signaled that he had certain impulse control issues, but that's no reason to throw his fat ass out a fifty story window. \nWADE Sorry... MAX (as if to a child) I think I speak for everyone here when I say that your actions were excessive and, yes, more than just a little wasteful... \nMax looks over at the cowering scientists. \nMAX (CONT'D) ...then again, it seemed to have had the desired effect - toss Short Round out next. \nWade starts for the Short Scientist. \nSHORT SCIENTIST Wait! \n", "test1_true": "SHORT SCIENTIST (CONT'D) We have a different moral perspective than our late colleague. \nMAX The hell you say. (PAUSE) I need one to test and one to use. \nSHORT SCIENTEST One to test?

DELHI, INDIA - OFFICE TOWER CORRIDORS -- DAY \nMax and Wade, striding towards the elevators. Passing cubicles that Indian workers cower under - we realize Max's heavily armed Henchmen had SEIZED THE ENTIRE FLOOR. MAX Call our people at Goliath, tell them we'll have a special package arriving on the 17th. \nHe snaps his fingers and the Henchman follow... \nEXT. NEW ORLEANS - WAREHOUSE DISTRICT -- NIGHT \nNew Orleans. A non-descript warehouse among many. \nROQUE (O.S.) So this is what your girl came up with, huh? \nINT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT \nLarge and empty. Clay and Roque take a look around it. \nCLAY Better than a ball pit... \nROQUE You sure you're thinking clear on this? (off Clay's look) I know you. When you slip, it's always cause of a woman. \nCLAY Name one time that- ROQUE (INSTANTLY) Carla. \nCLAY Carla wasn't the problem, Carla's husband was the problem- \nROQUE Carla's husband wasn't the one who SHOT YOU- \nCLAY Okay. Yes. She shot me. (PAUSE) But only in the leg. \nROQUE What about Emma? \nCLAY Emma doesn't count, we never slept together. \nROQUE Because she put a bomb in your car. \nCLAY I admit, that took some of the romance out of the relationship. \nROQUE And now this chick, first time you meet her, burns down our hotel. Also, she kills people for a living. These are not good signs... \nCLAY I'm clear, Roque. \nRoque studies Clay long and hard. \nROQUE You better be. Or we're done. \nINTERRUPTED as a DOOR CREAKS OPEN - Clay and Roque immediately have their PISTOLS OUT facing down an entering POOCH Damn. We missed you too. \nCOUGAR is with him. Clay and Roque lowers their weapons and go to embrace them... Pooch BEAR-HUGS Roque. Cougar nods to Clay. \nPOOCH (CONT'D) So what's this I hear about Clay gettin' us killed over a girl? \nFrom the SHADOWS: \nAISHA (O.S.) Been a long time since anyone called me a girl. \nThe guys START as she emerges. All woman. POOCH Jesus, Lady! Ten outta ten for stealth and shit, but next time could you just knock? \nROQUE How long you been back there? \nAISHA Long enough. (TO CLAY) She put a bomb in your car? \nCLAY She was volatile. Aisha, meet Pooch, Roque, and Cougar. \nA beat as she takes this motley bunch in. \nAISHA Really? You can't hang out with anyone just named \"Phil\"? \nAnother CREAK - Jensen enters. \nJENSEN Hail, hail, the gang's all here! Colonel. Roque. Pooch. Silent Bob. Hottie. (TO AISHA) I'm gonna need a moment alone with the boys if you don't mind, but I'd like to reserve the right to awkwardly hit on you later? \n", "test1_id": 2100, "test2_input": "CLAY (CONT'D) You want to go over the plan? \nShe steps into the room towards him. Reaching for her: \nCLAY (CONT'D) Let's go over the plan... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOTEL ROOM BALCONY -- NIGHT \nClay and Aisha. After. Looking out at the city. \nAISHA So, what really happened to you in Afghanistan? \nClay looks over at her. Down at the TEDDY BEAR tattoo... And shakes his head. \nCLAY (SOFTLY) That's not for you. \nShe traces her fingers over it... CLAY (CONT'D) Why do you want Max dead? \nAisha, taken aback by the suddenness of the question. \nAISHA He's a bad man. Isn't that enough? \nCLAY No. \nA beat. She looks at him. \nAISHA When you tell me about Afghanistan? I'll tell you about Max. \nCLAY Fine. It's hot. There's lots of sand. Your turn. \nAisha smiles at this. Shaking her head. \nAISHA Why were you alone when I found you? \nThat takes Clay off guard. Looking out at the city. \nCLAY The guys got sick of it. \nAISHA Sick of what? \nCLAY Of hearing about Max. Of hearing me say we had to do something when there wasn't anything to do. They wanted to be around their families. Jensen has a sister. Pooch has a wife and daughters. \nAISHA And he hasn't told them he is alive? \nCLAY Would you? The people you loved the most, would you put them in that kind of danger? Aisha, side-stepping the question: \nAISHA So Roque has no one. \nCLAY He's got me. \nAISHA And you have... \nCLAY Enough hate to get us both through the day. He stuck with me when no one else would. And I ain't the easiest guy to stick with. \nAisha studies him. AISHA If you two really fought, he would kill you, I think. \nCLAY You think. \nAISHA I'm almost sure of it. \nCLAY Why? \nAISHA Because you care what happens to the others. You wouldn't put them at risk to save yourself. \nCLAY And you think that's a weakness. \nAISHA I know it is. Law of the jungle. \nCLAY We're not in the jungle. \nShe looks at him. AISHA Oh, yes we are... \nINT. VAN -- MORNING \nIdling. Blacked out windows. Pooch behind the wheel, Cougar shotgun, Roque in back. Back door slides open and Clay and Aisha enter. Together. It doesn't go unnoticed. \nROQUE Well, that's just great. \nThat's it. Fed up, Pooch SHUTS THE ENGINE like dad in the family truckster. \n", "test2_true": "Pooch takes the keys out of the ignition and folds his arms. Clay sighs. Looks over to Roque. A beat. Then: \nCLAY (CONT'D) Sorry I hit you. \nPOOCH Good. Roque? \nA longer beat... \nPOOCH (CONT'D) Roque? \nFINALLY: \nROQUE Sorry I threatened to cut your head off. \nPOOCH Verrrry good. Now don't you two feel better? \nCLAY AND ROQUE (IN UNISON) No. \nPOOCH I don't give a shit, I do.

One large one stands out -- The GOLIATH HEADQUARTERS TOWER. \nJENSEN heads towards the building. Street bicycle, bike shorts, messenger bag. He's disguised as a Bike Messenger. \nJENSEN (SINGING) I got jungle fever, you've got jungle fever, we've got jungle fever, we're in love... INT. GOLIATH TOWER -- RECEPTION -- DAY \nJensen enters the reception area singing. Moves to the receptionist desk. A PRETTY RECEPTIONIST answering phones. \nJENSEN (STILL SINGING) ...she's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy, ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love... \nHe looks down at the Receptionist... \nJENSEN (CONT'D) Yo! Package for Henderson! \nThe Receptionist looks up. She's on the phone, distracted: \nRECEPTIONIST Excuse me one moment- (TO JENSEN) I'll take that, thank you. \nJENSEN No can do, chica, gotta put it in his hands. He's gotta sign. \nRECEPTIONIST (back on phone) I'm sorry--could you say that again? \nJENSEN Babydoll, I'm on the clock here! \nThe Receptionist looks up at Jensen, not particularly amused. She points towards the elevators. \nRECEPTIONIST Forty fifth floor. \nINT. ELEVATOR -- GOLIATH TOWER -- CONTINUOUS \nTIGHT ON JENSEN as the elevator doors close on him. \nJENSEN (SINGING) I got jungle fever, you've got jungle fever, we've got jungle fever, we're in love... \nDOORS CLOSE. INT. ELEVATOR / HENDERSON'S OFFICE - GOLIATH TOWER \nAlone, Jensen opens the messenger bag. REVEAL A SUIT. Pre-set, ready to slide on over his bike clothes. Dials a cell phone while he dresses super fast. \nJENSEN (ON PHONE) Mr. Henderson, please. \nINTERCUT WITH HENDERSON'S OFFICE: \nA SECRETARY sitting in the outer office. \nSECRETARY Who's calling, please? \nJENSEN - DRESSING IN THE ELEVATOR: \nJENSEN Richard Hertz from Internal Security. \nSECRETARY One moment, please... \nJENSEN, PANTSLESS, as the elevator STOPS. The 25th FLOOR. The DOORS OPEN. Two SECRETARIES about to enter the elevator freeze at the sight of PANTSLESS JENSEN. JENSEN Ladies... hi. \nThe ladies stare at Jensen. He calculates their gazes. \nJENSEN (CONT'D) Liking the angle of the dangle? \nDOORS SHUT before they can protest... \n", "test2_id": 2101, "test3_input": "ROQUE Last thing they'll expect... \nPOOCH Yeah, cause it's dumb. \nCLAY Jensen's already got the layout, and Cougar can spot on site.

All that's left is \nCLAY Pooch? \nPooch, struggling with the decision... \nPOOCH Last time we went in blind on an op, we lost everything... \nCLAY So? \nA beat. Pooch looks up. \nPOOCH So let's go get it back. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK HARBOR -- DAWN \nESTABLISHING. The harbor is enormous. A small TWIN HURRICANE BOAT cuts through the morning waves. Half mile from the Goliath docks. At the controls, Clay and Roque. THROUGH CLAY'S BINOCULARS: \nGOLIATH EMPLOYEES going about their business, preparing for a tanker docking. All seems normal until we look a bit closer: FOUR-MAN Par Sec security patrols. Bomb sniffing DOGS. Two Cobra ATTACK CHOPPERS. \nCLAY You ready? \nA GOLIATH TANKER approaches from behind. Roque looks back at the tanker. Not answering - he seems to have something on his mind. \nCLAY (CONT'D) Roque? \nROQUE I'm ready. \nClay drops the twin throttles and spins the speed boat towards the APPROACHING TANKER. Several TUGS and SECURITY LAUNCHES are maneuvering around it... \nINT. SECURITY LAUNCH - NEW YORK HARBOR \nClay and Roque approach one of the launches from behind. Climbing aboard. They take the two SECURITY MEN from behind with TASERS, then strip off their outer gear, revealing PAR-SEC UNIFORMS. \nCLAY (INTO RADIO) We're in. Status. \nEXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - PERIMETER STREET \nA block off the front gate. A blacked out Chevy van. Pooch sits behind the wheel. Ready for exfiltration. \nPOOCH The Pooch is good. \nCLAY (O.S.) Cougar, squelch if you're in position. \nEXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - SHORELINE \nA drainage pipe with a thick security cage covering it. We PUSH IN HARD, reveal a small opening cut in the cage it -- THROUGH the opening -- FIRE 70 FEET into the pipe -- through a second opening -- down another long pipe and \nSLAM UP HARD ON COUGAR. Crouched BELOW the terminal. Looking up through a grilled man hole at Par-sec Guards. \nCOUGAR Squelch. \nEXT. NEW YORK HARBOR \nClay and Roque dock their Launch and hop out. Blending in perfectly with the Par-Sec Guards. \nCLAY Jensen, we're coming. You ready? \nINT. GOLIATH SHIPPING ROOM - SAME \nA huge shipping room with hundreds of crates. We push in on a LARGE WOODEN CRATE. The side of the crate STARTS TO FLEX... and SPLINTERS as Jensen breaks out of his box! \nJENSEN And the crowd goes wild... \nINT. / EXT. GOLIATH - SHIPPING ROOM DOOR \nClay and Roque approach. Knock. From the inside, Jensen leaning up against the door. \n", "test3_true": "Jensen opens the door. Clay and Roque quickly move in. \nJENSEN Drive should be in the Computer Room, two skylights over. \nCLAY Roque and I will set the charges here but we won't detonate until you have the drive. \nROQUE You can't settle for stealing the drive, you gotta blow up Goliath's shit too. CLAY What can I say, I hold a grudge. (TO JENSEN) Get gone. \nJensen nods. Knows how important his job is. Heading for a ladder. Clay and Roque begin to set CHARGES throughout the room... \nCLAY (CONT'D) Be ready to move the second Cougar hits the fire alarm... \nEXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - DAY \nCougar avoiding security. SCALING A LARGE OIL TANK, taking up a sniper position on top of it... \nACROSS THE TERMINAL \nJensen hopping rooftop to rooftop... \nBACK TO \nCougar in full sniper fire position. His sights dead on: A MASTER FIRE ALARM -- 300 yards down. His RADIO CRACKLES: \nPOOCH (O.S.) Guys, we got a problem... EXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - PERIMETER STREET \nPooch in the van, seeing through BINOCULARS... \nPOOCH Wade's here. \nAnd he is. Being given a TOUR by PAR-SEC GUARDS... \nINT. GOLIATH SHIPPING ROOM \nCLAY Are you kidding me? \nPOOCH (O.S.) No. I say we roll. \nEXT. GOLIATH ROOFTOPS Jensen, by a MIRRORED SKYLIGHT (so you can't see down into the room). Attaching a HARNESS to his waist... \nJENSEN I'm above the computer room, maybe thirty seconds from the drive... \nINT. GOLIATH SHIPPING ROOM \nClay, listening through the radio: \nPOOCH (O.S.) Wade's headed your way - last chance to get the duck out of Fodge... \nCLAY Something's not right. Something... \nFROM OFF CAMERA: \nROQUE (O.S.) Clay. \nCLAY What? \nRoque, standing in front of a HUGE CARGO CONTAINER. \nROQUE I think you should see this. Roque's got the doors of the container opened that he's looking in. Clay approaches... \nEXT. ROOFTOP \nJensen, finally ready to hit the computer room, GENUFLECTS once for luck... \nINT. GOLIATH SHIPPING ROOM \nClay and Roque staring... \nCLAY You think... Aisha? \nTHE CONTAINER -- Top to bottom, completely loaded with fresh minted stack BUNDLES OF CASH. More physical money than we have ever seen. By a lot. Ever. Then: ROQUE No. Not Aisha. \nClay turns to him as -- WHAM! -- a CROWBAR SMASHES DOWN on his head! Roque, gripping it, looking down at Clay... \nROQUE (CONT'D) You know, for a revenge driven conspiracy nut, you're pretty fucking gullible... \nEXT. ROOFTOP \nJensen, leaping through the SKYLIGHT...

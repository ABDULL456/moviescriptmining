{"train": "THE LOSERS \nWritten by \nPeter Berg & James Vanderbilt \nFebruary 2007 \nFADE IN ON: \nTHE DESERT. Sizzling dunes. Harsh. Unforgiving. \nAfghanistan - Three Years Ago \nWe hear faint SCREAMS. A man BEGGING... \nMAN (O.S.) No... please... There's no way... \nSand dunes stretch to the horizon. Nowhere to run... \nMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Nothing... can defeat... A SHADOW FALLS across the sand. Then a second. One looks like a Dog's Head. The other like... \nMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Gojira. \nHAND PUPPET SHADOWS. LAUGHTER from OTHER MEN. \"Godzilla\" pursues \"Dog Head\", catches him, and begins HUMPING HIM. \nMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Ooooh, Gojira! You the best! Me love you long time! \nSECOND MAN (O.S.) C'mon Jensen, you in or not? \nWHIP PAN to the Puppeteer and FREEZE-FRAME ON: \nJensen. 20's, Lennon glasses, wild blonde hair, shirt open. Bald eagle tattoo on his chest. RESUME SPEED: \nJENSEN And get cheated again? \nWHIP PAN to and FREEZE-FRAME ON: \nPooch. Mid 30's, black and solid. Eagle tattoo on right bicep, his NINE MONTH OLD DAUGHTER'S FACE tattooed on his left. Currently mock offended. RESUME SPEED: \nPOOCH The Pooch don't cheat. The Pooch may lie, the Pooch may steal-- \nJENSEN --the Pooch may refer to himself in the third person-- \nPOOCH --but the Pooch will not cheat. \nJENSEN The Pooch can rest easy, I was referring to Cougar. \nWHIP PAN and FREEZE FRAME ON: \nCougar. Age unknown. Tan camo cowboy hat pulled low over his eyes, long hair. Sniper Rock-God. He doesn't say or move much. Ain't no rattling him. RESUME SPEED: ROQUE (O.S.) It's Liar's Poker, Jensen, how in the hell is the man gonna cheat you at Liar's Poker? \nWHIP PAN as he asks the question and FREEZE FRAME ON: \nRoque. 30's. Close cropped black hair. If Lance Armstrong bred with Darth Vader. Doesn't smile much, but he's smiling now. The four are in \nEXT. HUMVEE -- DAY \nOpen air, the guys sit in the back. In the middle of the desert with nothing to do but wait. Roque holds the deck. \nROQUE Cards. The four take them. Lick the back, slap them to their foreheads -- two deuces (Jensen and Roque), a three (Pooch), and an eight (Cougar). Pitiful cards. \nJENSEN Got a feeling about this one, Roque. \nROQUE Your mama had that feeling too. \nAt which point, JENSEN PULLS A KNIFE... \n...and tosses it into the center of the circle. HIS BET. Roque responds by tossing a .357 MAGNUM from his belt in. \nROQUE (CONT'D) Raise you. \nPOOCH (INTRIGUED) That the one with the hollow points? \nROQUE Yup. \nPOOCH Oh, shit, I'm definitely in then. \nHe puts in a Desert Eagle. Jensen pulls a second, meaner looking knife. Twirling it. JENSEN This even me up? \nROQUE Exactly how many knives do you have, anyway? \nJENSEN (INTO RADIO) Dropkick, we strongly recommend cancellation of payload delivery- \nRADIO VOICE (O.S.) Abort order can only come from MISSION CONTROLLER- \nClay GRABS THE RADIO from Jensen: \nCLAY Mission Controller is Agency, Codename Max, repeat, Codename Max, so get him on the horn and- \nRADIO VOICE (O.S.) Already have, Pinball, your orders stand. Prep for exfil. \nSTATIC. A beat. The others stare at Clay. \nCLAY Cougar? \nCougar takes the butt of his rifle and SMASHES THE LASER DESIGNATOR TO BITS! Clay, into the radio: \nCLAY (CONT'D) Dropkick, this is Pinball, targeting equipment has suffered system failure, am calling an abort. \nSTATIC. Then, a DIFFERENT VOICE: \nMAX (O.S.) Well, that was stupid. \nThe voice is even. Distinctly unmilitary. Almost stoned. \nCLAY Who is this? This is a secure MILITARY NETWORK-- MAX (O.S.) Very stupid, Colonel... Franklin... Clay. \nClay blinks - no one uses names on comms. \nCLAY Max? There are children on site- \nMAX (O.S.) And you think I didn't know that? Not the sharpest of knives in the drawer, are you? We locked coordinates the moment you painted; delivery will occur on schedule. Max out. \nSTATIC. Clay hits the send button to respond - gets a SQUELCH. Cursing, tossing the radio to Jensen: CLAY Shit! Jensen, call the General at the Firebase, get him to abort- \nJENSEN Can't, they're jamming us- \nROQUE Then contact the plane directly- \nJENSEN (trying all channels) Negative, we're screwed! (LOOKING UP) There's nothing we can do... \nHis face, stricken. They all are. And then: \nCLAY There's something we can do. \nClay hefts his rifle. \nThe others stare at him. Automatically begin checking their own weapons. Roque runs it down for them: \nROQUE Five against a fortress, and we've got maybe six minutes before an airstrike sets the world on fire. \nCLAY So? \nROQUE So, I'll drive. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. AL GHOZAR FORT -- DAY \nWHAM! BAD GUYS firing wildly as our guys' HUMVEE PLOWS through the GATE! \nPOOCH I guess we're going with the fifty mujas with AK's option after all! \nA SERIES OF SHOTS -- We see just how good these guys are. Cougar on his knee in the back -- snipes SINGLE SHOT KILLS -- takes out SEVEN MEN. Roque pulls to a halt in the center of the compound -- Bad Guys, coming out of the woodwork with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. As the guys hop out: \nCLAY Pooch and Jensen, get a truck for the kids, the rest of us will be out in five- \nROQUE (CHECKING WATCH) -airstrike's in four and change- \nCLAY -out in four. On me! \nClay leads ZONE COVERAGE toward the building -- Roque and Cougar run middle -- QUICK DEATH STRIKES. Images BLAST fast and savage as these men KILL THEIR WAY INTO THE FORT. \nINT. AL GHOZAR FORT - KHYBER PASS - CONTINUOUS \nRoque calmly kicks in the door -- kills FIVE MEN sitting around a table with TWO YOUNG GIRLS in the middle -- the terrified girls run to him. The BAD GUYS have no chance -- Fast. Precise. SPECTACULAR. Our crew takes the fort. \nMOVING THROUGH a tight hallway, they find the children locked in a large empty room. They start leading them out. One LITTLE BOY stops Clay. In PASHTUN: \nLITTLE BOY \nClay checks the time. 3 MINUTES TO AIRSTRIKE... \nIN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRESTORM: All Pooch can see is FLAMES through the WINDSHIELD as they plow through the destruction. Glances in the REAR-VIEW: \nPOOCH Uh, Coug? \nCougar's sleeve, FULLY ABLAZE. He casually rips it off and tosses it out the back. \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - The fire clears... to reveal a 30 FOOT DROP. The guys scream as they PLUNGE OVER IT... \nWHOOMP! The Truck buries itself nose first in the sand. \nEXT. AFGHAN DESERT -- DAY \nSilence. Smoke rises from a crater that was once the Fort. The doors of the truck creak open. Most of the YOUNGSTERS GIGGLE. Fun ride. As the guys help them out: \nJENSEN Yeah, that was great, wasn't it? My favorite part was when we were completely on fire. What was yours? \nSounds of a BLACKHAWK CHOPPER APPROACHING... \nPOOCH Exfil incoming. How are we gonna explain the kids, Colonel? \nClay doesn't seem to hear him. \nPOOCH (CONT'D) Colonel? (Clay looks up) The kids. What do we tell 'em? \nA beat. Clay seems to shake off his daze as the BLACKHAWK sets down. Walking up to the chopper: \nCLAY Lieutenant, you're to evac these civvies to the Firebase immediately- \nBLACKHAWK PILOT Negative, our orders are to transport a five-man team only. \nClay's eyes dart down to the Pilot's neck. A SILVER CRUCIFIX hangs around it. Clay, softer: \nCLAY You really want to leave twenty three kids in the desert to die? \nA beat. \nBLACKHAWK PILOT Not enough room for them and you... \nCLAY Then it's them. \nThe Pilot nods. Our guys begin loading the kids on... \nJENSEN \nClay helps Omar on last. The kid looks at him. He knows perfectly well what Clay saved him from in that basement. OMAR \nClay nods. A beat. The Pilot pulls the stick back and the CHOPPER ASCENDS. The kids wave goodbye to our guys. \nOmar, holding Clay's gaze as they rise. Only broken as the chopper begins to recede into the distance. The last Clay sees of him is that ratty little TEDDY BEAR... \nPOOCH Cute little buggers. Hope they can make it to our court-martial. \nROQUE Relax, Pooch, we're not going to be court-martialed - if anything, we're going to die of thirst wandering the desert, right Colonel? \nCLAY (IGNORES THIS) Jensen, see if you can cut into that Blackhawk's chatter--I want to know if he rats us out. \nAs Jensen tunes his radio... \nPOOCH So, how we getting back? Hitchhike? Magic carpet? I say magic carpet... \nROQUE (NOTICING) Guess they hustled up some air support after all - that's a Pakistani MiG up there... \nJensen's tuning into the MIG's frequency. Looking nervous. \nJENSEN Guys... This is bad... \nTURNS UP THE VOLUME: \nMIG PILOT (O.S.) Max, Cobra One. Bandit locked, twelve o'clock low... Their eyes go wide with understanding.... \nMAX (O.S.) Understood, Cobra One. Kill Bandit. \nClay and Cougar have ALREADY BEGUN RUNNING towards the receding chopper on the horizon. As the MIG SWINGS IN BEHIND THE BLACKHAWK.... \nMIG PILOT (O.S.) (CALMLY) Fox One. \nWOOSH... The MIG FIRES - AIR TO AIR MISSILE... WHOOMP! The Blackhawk's tail rotor SHEARED OFF, the chopper spinning and falling but still intact... \nPooch, the pilot, from somewhere SCREAMING: \nPOOCH Auto-rotate, go with it, you can still put her down if you- \nROQUE Shut up. \nPOOCH Hurry... \nROQUE Shut up... \nThird set out, ripping the frame from the window... \nEXT. KARACHI SAFE HOUSE -- SAME \nWIDE ON THE CITY BLOCK: As the SAFE HOUSE EXPLODES! Debris flying far enough to shower the open air bazaar being held two blocks East. HOLD on the smoldering ruins. AS WE SLOWLY FADE TO... \nEXT. NEW HAMPSHIRE AIRBASE -- NIGHT \nA rain slicked tarmac. MARINES carrying FIVE FLAG DRAPED COFFINS off a troop transport carrier. Our guys' FAMILIES watching. Clay's mother. Jensen's girlfriend. Pooch's wife and daughters. Tears in their eyes. \nINTERCUT WITH... \nINT. CIA BACKROOM -- NIGHT \nSomewhere secret. Our guys' PERSONNEL FOLDERS. Each being opened. Each being stamped \"DECEASED\". BACK TO... \nEXT. NEW HAMPSHIRE AIRBASE -- NIGHT As the Marines SALUTE the passing coffins. POOCH'S WIFE lowers her head, weeping. CUT TO: \nBLACK SCREEN. OVER IT IN SMALL LETTERS: \nTHE LOSERS \nFADE UP: \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT \nA nice quiet neighborhood. White picket fences, the whole nine. WE'RE WATCHING from outside the kitchen window of a Cape Cod two story. POOCH'S WIFE JOLENE doing dishes. \nOlder. Hair cropped. Springfield, Massachusetts - NOW. \nShe dries her hands and heads upstairs. We catch a glimpse of her in the upstairs hall. Then in her DAUGHTER's bedroom. 4 YEARS OLD NOW. Mom, putting her down. \nIn the backyard, by the swingset, a figure watches. POOCH. Indulging in a nightly ritual... \nEXT. CITY STREETS -- NIGHT \nMexico City. CARNIVALE. Day of the Dead. Jesters and masks. Music. A man with a cowboy hat walks among them. COUGAR. Sees Mexican Police eyeing him. Walks a little faster. Hat pulled low as fireworks explode above... \nEXT. DESERT STRIP MALL -- NIGHT Phoenix, Arizona. A late night internet cafe, wedged between a donut shop and spinning studio. JENSEN sits. Alone. Playing INTERACTIVE ON-LINE COMBAT... \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD, FL - HOLLYWOOD DOG TRACK -- MORNING \nHollywood, Florida. DOGS IN FULL SPRINT. A few thousand SPECTATORS. Not the Derby, but reasonably enthused. \nIN THE CHEAP SEATS -- CLAY and ROQUE. Three years older. But in no way bolder. They look almost... Broken. \nRoque's got his feet up. Sucks lazily on a straw embedded in what looks like a SODA POP. Clay's got BINOCULARS, following the action on the track -- Muscle shredded greyhounds tearing over the dirt. One crosses the FINISH LINE. Roque checks their ticket. Yawns. \nROQUE (FLAT) You lost again. \nCLAY We lost again. \nClay's got the binoculars up, slow-checking the track. \nROQUE You placed the bet. \nCLAY You gave me the money. \nROQUE Well, that was stupid of me, wasn't it? \nClay drums his fingers along the binocs as he scans. We see on his right hand, between his thumb and index finger - A TATTOO. A TEDDY BEAR. Looks just like Omar's... \nROQUE (CONT'D) That makes, what, three in a row? \nCLAY Four. \nSomething glint-flashes...catches Clay's eye. He looks across the track, towards the PARKING LOT. ROQUE You know where you're messing up? You're putting all our money on the dogs with the best odds. \nCLAY Yeah, I've just gone crazy with that approach. \nCLAY SCANS THE LOT -- A YOUNG WOMAN in tight jeans walks towards a black pick up, carrying a PAIR OF BINOCULARS. \nROQUE Never play a longshot, you're never gonna win. \nClay doesn't respond. Watching her. Roque exhales. ROQUE (CONT'D) We're at a dogtrack at 10 a.m. - could this get any more sleazy? \nCLAY (turning to her) I know you? \nAISHA Relax, slugger... I like arms. That's all. \nCLAY Do I not look relaxed? \nAISHA No. (PAUSE) Think we can change that? \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. HOLLYWOOD, FL. - GOLD COAST MOTEL - LATER \nClay and Aisha enter his motel room. Aisha checks out the sparse accommodations. \nAISHA (DEADPAN) Wow, it's everything a girl could dream of. Got a bathroom? \nCLAY No, I specifically requested the only hotel room in the world that doesn't have a bathroom. AISHA You lookin' to turn a \"yes\" into a \"no\" here? \nClay points to the bathroom. \nINT. HOLLYWOOD, FL - GOLD COAST - BEDROOM / BATHROOM \nAisha checks herself in the mirror. A touch of lip gloss. \nAISHA So what brings you to Florida? \nClay IN THE BEDROOM. Leans over - stretching his hamstrings. Does a few subtle twists - Loosening up. \nCLAY Convention. \nAISHA (O.S.) Convention for what? \nShit. Clay looks around. Weakly: \nCLAY ...Air conditioners. \nIN THE BATHROOM - Aisha studies herself in the mirror. Stretching her arms, prepping for some physical activity... \nAISHA They have whole conventions devoted to air conditioners? \nIN THE BEDROOM \nCLAY You'd be surprised. \nAisha comes back out. Both now stretched and loose. \nAISHA Bet I would. Where were we? \nThey study each other. Aisha slowly moves towards Clay. \nCLAY You were about to tell me how much you enjoy spending time at the dog track... Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down his stomach... \nAISHA Saw me there did you? \nClay strokes her cheek... \nCLAY Uh-huh... \nAISHA Didn't see me at the McDonald's though... \nTheir lips, inches from touching... \nAISHA (CONT'D) I have a proposition for you... \nWHAM! Clay DECKS HER. She REELS BACK -- LOADED GLOCK up and out and -- Clay ducks left -- BACKHANDS HER with his forearm -- sends her FLYING across the room -- PAUSE. Both breathing hard. Staring at one another: \nAISHA (CONT'D) Just hear me out. I don't want to hurt you. \nCLAY You're not going to. \nAISHA Yes, I am. \nHe foot-plants, spins, re-attacks and IT IS ON! INSANELY VISCOUS: tearing the room to utter shreds. Fists SMASHING. A FACE KICK, plaster SMASHES. \nShe HURLS a twenty six inch color TELEVISION at him. This EXPLODES against a wall. Sparks give to flame as the room starts to burn hot around these two warriors... \nThey continue to fight like RABID WOLVES. And they're GRINNING. Enjoying this. THEN FREEZE -- \nAISHA ON TOP OF CLAY -- Each has a BUCK KNIFE up and tight against the other's throat. Blades on skin. TIE GAME. Neither giving. FLAMES AROUND THEM: \nAISHA (CONT'D) Room's on fire. CLAY Noticed. What do you want? \nCLAY Show-off. Then? \nAISHA Then I stopped auditioning for you. This is a check for ten grand- \nHe holds up his hand. \nCLAY We're not mercenaries. \nAISHA Operational capital, that's all. (holding out the check) You've been waiting three years for a shot at this guy. You're not gonna get another. You want Max, this is it. He takes it. She hands him some papers along with it. \nAISHA (CONT'D) Intel on the shipment. You check it out, you check me out, you decide - are you in or not? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MEXICO - BEACH CAMPSITE - NIGHT \nCOUGAR chilling by a small fire. Working his way through a bottle of tequila. His blackberry rings... \nINT. VIRGINIA MOTEL - NIGHT \nPOOCH in a Motel 6 Laying in bed alone, watching an old Jimmy Stewart movie. Blackberry rings... INT. ARIZONA MOTEL - MOTEL \nJENSEN's in bed with TWO GIRLS from his spin class. Blackberry rings... \nTIGHT ON THE THREE BLACKBERRY MESSAGES: \nNOW THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO \nEXT. DELHI, INDIA - MIDDAY \nThe city midday is UTTERLY PACKED. Overflowing. The capital of the next great Superpower. Delhi, India. \nINT. DELHI, INDIA - OFFICE TOWER \nA TOP FLOOR OFFICE SUITE of a high end technology company. Degrees on the walls. A Bollywood musical BLARES from a TV loud enough to cover up the SOUNDS OF BEGGING... \nTHREE INDIAN SCIENTISTS -- A short guy, a tall guy, and a really fat guy -- On the floor, BOUND, terrified, looking up at a tough looking bastard standing over them -- \nWADE. Our burly man from the safe-house. Now he works for the suit in the brown French club chair. The Big Man, Master of Disaster, Trouble on a Firestick... MAX. \nSHORT SCIENTIST You know we cannot do this... We cannot do what you ask... \nMAX Tell me - is this a moral issue or a financial issue? \nFAT SCIENTIST A moral issue. \nMAX (ACTUALLY CURIOUS) Really? You object morally to this deal? \nFAT SCIENTIST Yes. I'm sorry. Please leave... \nMax takes a moment. Thinks. MAX Okay, here's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing \"No.\" I'm hearing \"Leave,\" and I'm hearing \"I'm sorry.\" Is that what I'm hearing? \nFAT SCIENTIST Please... you must leave... \nMax nods to himself. He thought so. \nMAX Right. Okay, so that is what I'm hearing. Now, I want you to listen. Listen carefully because I want you to hear this. Wade? \nWade hauls him up the FAT SCIENTIST. Without hesitation, he walks him over to the large glass window looking down FIFTY THREE STORIES above Delhi and HURLS HIM OUT... \nEXPLODING through the glass. As the poor bastard FALLS AND SCREAMS... The other scientists scream at the sight. Max turns to Wade, bewildered: \nMAX (CONT'D) What the hell was that? \nWADE You gave me the nod. \nMAX A \"hit him in the face\" nod, not a \"throw him out the window\" nod. \nWADE I thought that's what you wanted. \nMAX At most--at most that was a \"break his fingers\" nod. (slams his fist) I mean Jesus, Wade, the man was scientific genius. Granted his weight signaled that he had certain impulse control issues, but that's no reason to throw his fat ass out a fifty story window. \nWADE Sorry... MAX (as if to a child) I think I speak for everyone here when I say that your actions were excessive and, yes, more than just a little wasteful... \nMax looks over at the cowering scientists. \nMAX (CONT'D) ...then again, it seemed to have had the desired effect - toss Short Round out next. \nWade starts for the Short Scientist. \nSHORT SCIENTIST Wait! \nAISHA I'd expect no less. (TO CLAY) Have fun... \nThe guys admire her form as she leaves. When she's gone: \nCLAY What do you have on her? \nJENSEN Besides a pants-busting crush? (OPENING LAPTOP) Her intel checks out. The cargo will be arriving here in two days. \nROQUE (DEADPAN) Wow, I completely trust her now. \nCLAY What else? \nJENSEN Grew up in Afghanistan, Mom was a local, Dad was white devil... oh, and CIA's got a kill order out on her. (MORE) \nJENSEN (CONT'D) As does Hamas, Sien Fein, MOSAAD-- pretty much everyone with the exception of PETA wants this chick amscrayed. \nPOOCH Why? \nJENSEN Last CIA email flagged with her name says she was digging for information about a special project... (looks up at them) \"Codename: MAX\". A moment as this sinks in. \nPOOCH They want to wet her cause she's lookin' into Max. That sounds familiar... \nROQUE (DUBIOUS) Could those files- \nJENSEN (finishing his question) -have been planted for us to find? (shaking his head) CIA timestamp, digital watermark... Someone would've had to go to a lot of trouble, and I mean a lot, to fool me. \nClay nods. Looks to the others. \nCLAY I say we go with her. Pooch? \nA beat. Pooch nodding: \nPOOCH I'm in. \nCLAY Jensen? \nJENSEN Hell yeah. Cougs? \nCougar nods his assent. Only one left. ROQUE. They all turn to him. A beat. \nROQUE For now. \nJensen smacks his fist on the table, excited: \nJENSEN Hot damn! Back with the Colonel, doing another bid for God and COUNTRY- ROQUE Country turned her back on us, and God can screw. This one's for us. \nCLAY And anyone who calls me \"Colonel\" better be ready to take a beating or an order. We ain't soldiers anymore. \nPOOCH (HAPPY NONETHELESS) So what's the plan, my civilian brothers? \nCLAY Sleep. We start tomorrow. \nJENSEN Start where? \nCLAY We're going bird hunting. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIJI - BLUE ISLAND SKY - DAY \nA White Bell AB-139 CHOPPER glides into frame -- FLYING over a small series of white sanded jungle islands... \nMAX (V.O.) It used to be so simple. A post 9/11 world... \nLOOKING UP FROM ONE ISLAND: \nHOWLER MONKEYS taunt-scream up as the chopper slow-circles over the beautiful deserted island. Outer Fijian Islands. \nMAX (V.O.) (CONT'D) As a country we spoke with one voice, moved with one purpose. We had a wicked boner for doing the right thing, and now look at us! \nINT. BELL AB-139 - SAME \nMax wearing a Hawaiian shirt and Raybans. ZINC on his nose, rubbing suntan lotion on his forearms. To Wade: MAX 90 percent of the globe is tooling up to whack us and we're too busy losing our nerve to notice. It's Us versus Them and right now my money would be on them... \nCAMERA DROPPING FAST out of the chopper -- SOARING DOWN low -- TRACKING WITH a howler monkey up a PALM TREE -- Then airborne as the monkey leaps twenty feet to another. \nMAX (V.O.) (CONT'D) Wasn't it Thomas Jefferson who once said the tree of freedom must be watered with etcetera, etcetera? We need to wake people up, Wade. We need to hit them in the face, angry up the blood, give them their balls back. We TRACK WITH our lead monkey up to something very un- monkey like... Something SINISTER. A metallic, trunk- like object. Flashing lights and transponder devices... \nMAX (CONT'D) We need to give them a ten megaton reality check. (ala John Lee Hooker) Boom Boom Boom Boom... \nA half-millisecond breath. Then, UTTER DESTRUCTION! \nINT. BLACKED OUT COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCLAY Go. \nThe sound of HEAVY IRON RELEASING as the WALLS START TO SEPARATE, revealing we are INSIDE THE BROKEN-DOWN TRUCK. \nCLAY (CONT'D) Make the call. \nJensen taps into the military emergency band. Takes a breath, centers himself, then... \nJENSEN Base One, this is Cavalier 415! We have been in a collision with a civilian vehicle! Carvey's dead an' Freeman's hurt bad! He's messed up his neck! He can't move! Oh god, it's horrible! We need medevac immediate! HE'S GOT KIDS, BASE ONE, HE'S GOT KIDS! \nBASE ONE (O.S.) Roger, Cavalier 415! We're scrambling a chopper, hang in there! Jensen, all smiles, looks up at Clay. \nJENSEN Robert De Niro who? \nPooch and Roque have the four drugged soldiers laid out on the sand. All four are clearly breathing. \nPOOCH Sleeping like babies. \nROQUE What about their ride? \nClay steps off the trailer with a heavy duty air hoist. \nCLAY Flip it. TIGHT SHOTS of the air ram attached to the undercarriage of the Humvee. The tires start to lift off the ground... higher... Four pairs of hands start rocking the truck... \nPooch and Jensen, on one side. Quietly: \nPOOCH What do you think's up with that \"don't call me Colonel\" stuff? \nJENSEN Classic loss of identity. Clay defined himself by his place in the military structure. (MORE) \nJENSEN (CONT'D) It was his way of measuring the good he did in the world. Without it, he's just another loser like the rest of us. \nPooch blinks, impressed. Then: \nJENSEN (CONT'D) You know there's a website where you can download MP3's of donkeys farting? How cool is that? \nA FINAL PUSH... and the Humvee FLIPS. FROM JENSEN'S RADIO: \nBASE ONE (O.S.) Cavalier 415 this is Medevac Delta. Be advised, we are airborne and in- bound to your position! \nCLAY All right, everyone get into character... \nCUT TO: \nJensen and Roque LIE ON THE GROUND by the flipped Humvee. \nJENSEN Lot of work to bum a ride. \nROQUE Shut up, Jensen. \nJENSEN You shut up, Roque. You're dead, I'm the spinal injury - Spinal injury can talk, dead can't. \nROQUE Stop talking or I'll break your neck for real. \nJENSEN Seriously, you have to get more into your role! Dead guy! No talking! Dead guy! \nClay leans against the truck. In the distance, the faint outline of a massive DOUBLE ROTOR TROOP TRANSPORT CHOPPER. \nCLAY Here we go... \nINT. CHOPPER - NEW MEXICO SKY - SAME \nBehind the pilot as he moves in on the accident scene... \nPILOT (INTO RADIO) Base One, this is Medevac Delta. We have visual on Cavalier 415. \nEXT. CRASH SITE - NEW MEXICO DESERT - CONTINUOUS \nClay waves the chopper in. It lands on the road. TWO EMTs leap out and race towards the fallen soldiers. The first EMT kneels by Jensen. \nEMT Alright buddy, we're gonna get you patched up in no time... \nJENSEN Y-you ever treat anyone who'd been gut shot... \nEMT Sure, in Iraq. What a mess... \nJensen pulls his COLT, presses it up into the EMT's GUT. \nJENSEN Means you know what's coming to you if try to play hero. Now, lose the radio mic, Bones. INT. CHOPPER COCKPIT - SAME \nCLAY No, you're not. \nROQUE Yes, I am. \nCLAY No. \nROQUE Right now. \nHe thumbs back the hammer... A TENSE MOMENT... And then Roque lowers the gun. \nCLAY See? \nROQUE She's coming with us. And if anything feels like a set-up, I put a bullet in her skull. (TO AISHA) Sound fair? \nAISHA Oh, completely. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for prayers. \nROQUE You're Muslim? \nAISHA You know, you are a sharp one--and don't let any of these other boys tell you different. \nWith that, she turns and walks away into the shadows. Roque lowers the weapon. A beat. To Clay: \nROQUE I don't like this. \nCLAY I picked up on that. \nPOOCH I'm with Roque, man. Agency thinks we're dead. We show up alive and kickin', start waving our dicks around in public, they're gonna make it their business to bury us. They'll call us terrorists, all KINDSA SHIT- \nCLAY What do you think we are now? (to all of them) Best case scenario, this gets us face to face with Max- ROQUE What if it doesn't? What if we never get face to face with him. Are you gonna be able to live with that? Ever? \nClay doesn't reply. A pall, cast over the guys. Finally: \nPOOCH Hell, let's just say it out loud... (PAUSE) We do this, we're declaring war on the Central Intelligence Agency. \nSilence, as the guys take this in. Then, from the corner: \nCOUGAR They started it. \nSMASH TO: \nEXT. NEW ORLEANS -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY \nSWOOPING DOWN over the waterways, threading our way between buildings, past the islands slamming into \nEXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT, NEW ORLEANS \nA G-550, tire chalked. A fork lift removes a large VAULT- LIKE PACKAGE from the back of the plane -- THE CARGO. \nA fifteen ton ATTACK-STABILIZED CASH TRANSPORT RIG idles, surrounded by TWENTY ASSAULT TROOPERS, loading up. Machine guns, frag grenades, body armor. \nBY THE JET -- WADE and FENNEL, our briefcase bomb friends, talks with a G. Gordon Liddy wrinkle muscleman. \nFENNEL As of this moment, the truck is designated an extraterritorial zone of immunity. Under no circumstances whatsoever are you or your men to allow the package to leave the truck before it's secure in the compound - to do so would be considered an act of treason and punishable as such. \nLIDDY Understood and acknowledged, sir. As the package is loaded into the MONSTER ARMORED RIG... \nWADE Ten men ride with the package and another ten ride chase. \nTen rock hard WARRIORS in a beefed up chase van. \nWADE (CONT'D) Let's go. \nEXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT -- DAY \nThe two truck armored convoy pulls out of the private airport and passes a parked TOWN CAR... \nINT. TOWN CAR - SAME \nClay, Roque, and Jensen watch the armored trucks pass by. Roque has a silenced long gun out as the second truck passes. As Roque PULLS THE TRIGGER... \nEXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS \nA silenced AIR BLAST -- we TRAVEL FAST with Roque's ordinance -- SMACKING SILENT onto the rear bumper of the lead truck. A ballistic, putty-coated recon tracker. \nINT. TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS \nJensen's laptop GPS goes hot. Green dot indicates CONVOY. CLAY Are we wired? \nJENSEN Like Belushi. (INTO RADIO) Target is westbound. Heading for the bridge... \nClay fires up the Town Car and follows. \nHe stalks away. Roque glowers. Heads the other direction. \nJENSEN Don'tcha hate it when Mom and Dad fight? \nCougar grunts in response. \nPOOCH So what do we do about the nuke? (PAUSE) Did I just actually say that? \nOn Aisha. A smile forming... \nAISHA I have an idea... \nINT. NEW ORLEANS POLICE DEPARTMENT -- DAY \nThe DESK SERGEANT sips a cup of coffee. Doing the Sunday crossword. Poorly. A quiet afternoon... \nA HUB-BUB outside. Rising voices. \nPATROLMAN (O.S.) Holy- Sarge, come quick! \nThe Sergeant rises, and we follow him through the station towards the front doors. Moving faster and more nervously as the NOISE OUTSIDE GROWS. Finally stepping out into \nEXT. NEW ORLEANS POLICE DEPARTMENT -- DAY \nThe street where a CROWD has gathered. Lookie-loos with camcorders. The Sergeant pushes through them to find \nFENNEL. Eyes wide with fear. DUCT TAPED TO THE WARHEAD. \nA SIGN hangs around his neck that reads Death to America! in big cheery letters and has a SMILEY FACE on it... \nMATCH WITH: \nINT. SMOKED UP ASIAN BAR -- BACK ROOM -- DAY \nThe image of FENNEL tied to the bomb, broadcast on the THAI NEWS on a black and white TV. Wade squints at it. \nWADE That's gonna be a quick trial... \nMAX Wonderful guy, salt of the earth, he'll be missed--who took my bomb, Wade? \nWADE You're not gonna like it... MAX Because I've been such a fan of how things have gone up till now? \nWade shrugs and slides some PHOTOS across the table to him. SCREEN-GRABS from TRAFFIC CAMERAS -- CLAY, ROQUE, and JENSEN in the towncar during the heist. A long beat... \nMAX (CONT'D) Who the hell are these people? \nWADE Colonel Clay and his unit. You had them killed three years ago? \nMAX I also had several African nations overthrown three years ago, I'm a BUSY GUY- WADE The Jamal al-Fadhil situation? \nA beat. \nMAX Shit. \nWADE Yeah. \nMAX Okay, they need to get dead. Get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours. \nWADE So what's the plan? \nMAX What's the plan? The plan is - get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours. \nWADE Okay. \nMAX Are we now clear on the plan or do you want to try a third go-around? \nWADE WE'RE CLEAR- \nMAX Because what I'm going to need you to do is get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours. You get that, right? \nWADE I get it. \nWade heads for the door... \nMAX And Wade? \nWade turns back. Max, SMILING: \nMAX (CONT'D) We're gonna need a new bomb. \nINT. NORTH DELHI - PRIVATE HANGAR - DAY \nCLAY (CONT'D) You want to go over the plan? \nShe steps into the room towards him. Reaching for her: \nCLAY (CONT'D) Let's go over the plan... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOTEL ROOM BALCONY -- NIGHT \nClay and Aisha. After. Looking out at the city. \nAISHA So, what really happened to you in Afghanistan? \nClay looks over at her. Down at the TEDDY BEAR tattoo... And shakes his head. \nCLAY (SOFTLY) That's not for you. \nShe traces her fingers over it... CLAY (CONT'D) Why do you want Max dead? \nAisha, taken aback by the suddenness of the question. \nAISHA He's a bad man. Isn't that enough? \nCLAY No. \nA beat. She looks at him. \nAISHA When you tell me about Afghanistan? I'll tell you about Max. \nCLAY Fine. It's hot. There's lots of sand. Your turn. \nAisha smiles at this. Shaking her head. \nAISHA Why were you alone when I found you? \nThat takes Clay off guard. Looking out at the city. \nCLAY The guys got sick of it. \nAISHA Sick of what? \nCLAY Of hearing about Max. Of hearing me say we had to do something when there wasn't anything to do. They wanted to be around their families. Jensen has a sister. Pooch has a wife and daughters. \nAISHA And he hasn't told them he is alive? \nCLAY Would you? The people you loved the most, would you put them in that kind of danger? Aisha, side-stepping the question: \nAISHA So Roque has no one. \nCLAY He's got me. \nAISHA And you have... \nCLAY Enough hate to get us both through the day. He stuck with me when no one else would. And I ain't the easiest guy to stick with. \nAisha studies him. AISHA If you two really fought, he would kill you, I think. \nCLAY You think. \nAISHA I'm almost sure of it. \nCLAY Why? \nAISHA Because you care what happens to the others. You wouldn't put them at risk to save yourself. \nCLAY And you think that's a weakness. \nAISHA I know it is. Law of the jungle. \nCLAY We're not in the jungle. \nShe looks at him. AISHA Oh, yes we are... \nINT. VAN -- MORNING \nIdling. Blacked out windows. Pooch behind the wheel, Cougar shotgun, Roque in back. Back door slides open and Clay and Aisha enter. Together. It doesn't go unnoticed. \nROQUE Well, that's just great. \nThat's it. Fed up, Pooch SHUTS THE ENGINE like dad in the family truckster. \nINT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE \nHENDERSON, a middle aged mid-level manager reaches for his phone as the secretary looks on from her desk. \nHENDERSON This is Henderson. \nINTERCUT WITH JENSEN IN ELEVATOR JENSEN Good afternoon, Mr. Henderson, Richard Hertz from Internal Security. If you'd be kind enough to make your way down to the lobby? \nHENDERSON Uh... Can I ask what this is about? \nJensen is just about dressed. \nJENSEN It's a matter of a somewhat sensitive nature involving an (MORE) \nJENSEN (CONT'D) individual exposing himself to women in the elevators--best discussed in person. If you'd just head on down... \nEXT. HALLWAY BY ELEVATORS -- CONTINUOUS \nHenderson plods into his elevator. As the DOORS CLOSE on his elevator, the DOORS OPEN on the SECOND ELEVATOR. JENSEN, suited and pressed, steps out. Briefcase in hand. \nINT. HENDERSON'S OUTER OFFICE \nJensen enters, looking down at Henderson's secretary. JENSEN Hi, I'm Skippy from tech support. Is Henderson around? I'm supposed to install a firewall on his system- \nSECRETARY Oh, you just missed him by like two seconds. Can you come back in like an hour or so? \nJensen checks his watch. Big sigh. \nJENSEN Oooooh - no can do. Upstairs breathing down my neck. They want security upgraded for the senior managers all of a sudden. \nJensen, already moving into HENDERSON'S OFFICE: JENSEN (CONT'D) Five minutes and I'll be out of your hair! \nINT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE \nQUICK TIGHT SHOTS OF JENSEN doing what Jensen does best: Tearing into Henderson's computer. FROWNING... \nHenderson's secretary reaching for her phone... \nSECRETARY Security? \nBACK IN HENDERSON'S OFFICE: \nJensen checking his download. Smiles at the Secretary, then looks back to he screen. Pressing his RADIO EARPIECE... \nJENSEN According to this, the drive exists, Clay. \nINTERCUT WITH THE VAN: Clay shoots a look at Roque. \nCLAY You're sure? \nJENSEN Abso-tootly. \nCLAY Is it in the building? \nJENSEN No, somewhere off-site. It's gotta be a remote location, stand-alone. I'm checking their security logs-- wherever they've detailed the most guys is probably where it'll be... \nFROM BEHIND JENSEN: \nSECURITY GUARD 1 (O.S.) \"Skippy\"? \nJensen turns. He's face to face with a solid looking SECURITY OFFICER. He tries a smile: SECURITY GUARD 1 (CONT'D) Show me some ID. Real easy. \nJensen stands up, holding his briefcase. \nJENSEN Whoa! Take it easy. You're the- \nWHAM! Jensen SMASHES his metal briefcase across the security guard's face! The guard is unconscious before he hits the ground. Keying his RADIO EARPIECE: \nJENSEN (CONT'D) Get me out of here, Clay... \nCLAY (O.S.) (THROUGH RADIO) There's a fire exit thirty yards north of your position. \nJensen, heading for it... \nBIG SECURITY 1 (O.S.) Freeze like a statue, pretty boy! \nJensen slow turns to find THREE GUNS trained straight at him. Major security. These guys look extremely competent. \nJENSEN I'm warning you, man, I'm a lethal weapon... Jensen turns on the big fellah. \nJENSEN (CONT'D) It was this secret government project. They did stuff to me. Spooky stuff. Anal stuff. Turned me into a dangerous Telekinetic. (wiggles index fingers) As the old saying goes - you don't start none... there won't be none. \nJENSEN They've hired Par-Sec. A beat. This clearly means something bad to all of them. \nCLAY (HONESTLY) Oh, shit... \nAISHA Who's Par-Sec? \nJENSEN Paradigm Security Services. Ex- Special Forces. \nPOOCH Basically guys like Cougar but without the warm and cuddly side. \nCougar just glowers. CLAY Goliath must have brought them in after we hit their truck... \nSilence as they ponder the significance of a Par Sec security force. \nJENSEN Our drive is being guarded by military trained, trigger repressed, blood thirsty, stone cold killers... Am I the only one who's thinking maybe we just chill out and go to Six Flags? \nSilence. \nCLAY Comb that drive for every last scrap of info. We're on a plane for New York tomorrow... \nINT. BEAT TO SHIT MOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT \nClay's room again. Knock at the door again. Aisha again. \nCLAY Oh, hi. \nShe covers his mouth with hers... \nINT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT Jensen and Pooch sitting at a table. Both with laptops. Jensen tapping his keys. Roque enters, carrying a coffee. Stops short, seeing the others. Surprised. \nROQUE Thought you guys'd be back at the hotel. \nPOOCH Couldn't sleep. \nROQUE Me neither. Grabbed a coffee from the machine - you want one? \nHe slides into a chair. \nPOOCH No thanks. JENSEN You won't believe how detailed these files are. Every Goliath executive they've ever insured, their policies, their payouts- \nROQUE Life insurance? \nJENSEN Yeah. \nROQUE What's the biggest payout? \nJENSEN (STILL TYPING) Gotta be wrongful death... \nROQUE Pretty much what we're gonna be risking. (TO POOCH) What are you doing up? \nPOOCH Jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier. \nROQUE The hell you need a satellite for? Pooch shows him the screen of his computer - RECORDED VIDEO from earlier in the day. An OVERHEAD VIEW of a Playground - POOCH'S DAUGHTERS PLAYING. They both watch for a bit. The only sound, Jensen's typing. Then: \nPOOCH When we first went over in 2001, Jolene and my oldest Tina wanted to do the yellow ribbon thing, right? Only problem was there was no yellow ribbon to be found - all the stores had been cleaned out. \nROQUE Military neighborhood... \nPOOCH No doubt. And Tina's four at the time, and what she can't understand is why the ribbon's gotta be yellow. So Jolene sings her the song, right? To show her where the idea comes from. And when she's all done, Tina, four years old, looks my wife dead in her eye and says \"that's the dumbest song I ever heard.\" (LAUGHING) So my wife and my four year old ended up tying a frilly purple ribbon round the old oak tree in our yard to bring Daddy home... \nROQUE (SMILING) Thought that counts, right? \nPOOCH Yeah... \nTHEN: \nPOOCH (CONT'D) Jolene dated a guy last summer. Didn't turn into anything and I sure as hell can't blame her, but that man was in my house, Roque. I know you're not a hundred percent on this op, but if it can get me back to them... \nROQUE I hear you, man. \nA moment between them. Broken by: \nJENSEN (READING) Okay, biggest payout on a Goliath exec ever - 14 million and it was wrongful death - Vice President of Operations in Afghanistan, three years ago, paid to his daughter... \nHE TRAILS OFF IN SHOCK. Looking to Pooch and Roque: \nJENSEN (CONT'D) We're going to need to drive fast... INT. BEAT TO SHIT MOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT \nClay and Aisha, in bed. After. She traces her fingers along his Teddy Bear tattoo. Clay looks down at her. She gives him a smile. Mixing just the right amount of sensitivity and curiosity... \nCLAY You really want to know about Afghanistan? \nRoque, looking out the back window: \nROQUE Here they come... \nSure enough, the COBRAS are now tracking the VAN. Spotlights, swinging towards them... \nThe asphalt behind them ERUPTS. CANNON-FIRE blowing HUGE CHUNKS OF ROAD into the sky! SCREAMING over the SOUND: \nCLAY Somebody shoot something! \nCougar HEFTS HIS RIFLE. Setting up shop in the back. Sighting the choppers through his scope. Jensen, excited, and a little delirious from blood loss: \nJENSEN I think Cougar's got a plan! Coug, do you have a plan? (to the others) He's got a plan! \nPOOCH (trying to steer) Stop yelling at the sniper! THROUGH THE SCOPE -- Cougar sights the TAIL ROTOR of the chopper on the left... Smiles, PRESSES THE TRIGGER... \nAnd we see how one bullet can bring down two helicopters. \nThe bullet strikes the tail rotor DEAD CENTER -- it SHORTS and spins off -- sending the chopper itself into a spin -- COLLIDING with it's TWIN CHOPPER on the right -- they both twist and hink up -- their ROTORS SLICING INTO EACH OTHER -- both FINALLY CAREENING ONTO THE FREEWAY BEHIND \nOur guys. Driving away from the carnage of two exploding Cobra Helicopters splattered across the road... \nSafe. \nEXT. LEAR JET 550 (FLYING) -- DAY Coming in for LANDING... \nINT. LEAR JET 550 -- DAY \nAs it taxis towards a HANGAR. Max straightens his suit. Wade on the phone, frowning. Bad news. He flips the phone shut. To Max: \nWADE They got away. \nMAX So? (MORE) \nMAX (CONT'D) (off Wade's look) We know exactly where they're going, Wade. Port of New York, for their big final awesome stand against the forces of evil where they die. \nHe claps Wade and the shoulder and heads down the steps... \nINT. HANGAR -- DAY \n...where the TWO INDIAN SCIENTISTS wait. The Indian THUG CREW has been beefed-up to about TEN BIZARRE LOOKING, BLACK SUITED TOUGH GUYS. \nSHORT SCIENTIST Do you have the money? \nMAX Jesus, always with the money! So impersonal! How are you? How have you been? \nSHORT SCIENTIST I recently attended the funeral of my best friend who you had thrown out a window. How have you been? \nMAX Can't complain. I'm thinking of getting satellite radio in my car... \nSHORT SCIENTIST I think you're a freak. Too much Ronald McDonald. Too much fantasy football. \nMax smiles and spreads his arms... \nMAX Hey, I'm all about the bombs, baby. \nSHORT SCIENTIST We have your ordinance. You have twenty four hours to get the money. \nMax looks over to Wade. \nMAX Time to go make a withdrawal... \nAs he turns back to the plane... \nSHORT SCIENTIST New change of plan. You stay. \nMAX I've got to go get your money. \nSHORT SCIENTIST He'll get your money. You stay right here. \nA PAUSE as Max contemplates this little twist. \nMAX God, are you short. SHORT SCIENTIST Twenty three hours, fifty nine minutes... \nMax looks at Wade. \nMAX Get it done. \nWade heads for the jet. Max watches him go. As Wade boards the jet Max takes a big sigh. For the first time, looks like a guy who might not be quite as sure of things as he would like. Max Looks back to the Short Scientist. \nMAX (CONT'D) How much do you weigh? Seriously. \nROQUE Last thing they'll expect... \nPOOCH Yeah, cause it's dumb. \nCLAY Jensen's already got the layout, and Cougar can spot on site. Right? \nCougar nods. He's in. \nCLAY (CONT'D) Jensen? \nJENSEN Yeah, cause gettin' shot is awesome, I'm totally up for doing it again... \nHe gives a weak thumbs-up. In. All that's left is \nCLAY Pooch? \nPooch, struggling with the decision... \nPOOCH Last time we went in blind on an op, we lost everything... \nCLAY So? \nA beat. Pooch looks up. \nPOOCH So let's go get it back. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK HARBOR -- DAWN \nESTABLISHING. The harbor is enormous. A small TWIN HURRICANE BOAT cuts through the morning waves. Half mile from the Goliath docks. At the controls, Clay and Roque. THROUGH CLAY'S BINOCULARS: \nGOLIATH EMPLOYEES going about their business, preparing for a tanker docking. All seems normal until we look a bit closer: FOUR-MAN Par Sec security patrols. Bomb sniffing DOGS. Two Cobra ATTACK CHOPPERS. \nCLAY You ready? \nA GOLIATH TANKER approaches from behind. Roque looks back at the tanker. Not answering - he seems to have something on his mind. \nCLAY (CONT'D) Roque? \nROQUE I'm ready. \nClay drops the twin throttles and spins the speed boat towards the APPROACHING TANKER. Several TUGS and SECURITY LAUNCHES are maneuvering around it... \nINT. SECURITY LAUNCH - NEW YORK HARBOR \nClay and Roque approach one of the launches from behind. Climbing aboard. They take the two SECURITY MEN from behind with TASERS, then strip off their outer gear, revealing PAR-SEC UNIFORMS. \nCLAY (INTO RADIO) We're in. Status. \nEXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - PERIMETER STREET \nA block off the front gate. A blacked out Chevy van. Pooch sits behind the wheel. Ready for exfiltration. \nPOOCH The Pooch is good. \nCLAY (O.S.) Cougar, squelch if you're in position. \nEXT. GOLIATH TERMINAL - SHORELINE \nA drainage pipe with a thick security cage covering it. We PUSH IN HARD, reveal a small opening cut in the cage it -- THROUGH the opening -- FIRE 70 FEET into the pipe -- through a second opening -- down another long pipe and \nSLAM UP HARD ON COUGAR. Crouched BELOW the terminal. Looking up through a grilled man hole at Par-sec Guards. \nCOUGAR Squelch. \nEXT. NEW YORK HARBOR \nClay and Roque dock their Launch and hop out. Blending in perfectly with the Par-Sec Guards. \nCLAY Jensen, we're coming. You ready? \nINT. GOLIATH SHIPPING ROOM - SAME \nA huge shipping room with hundreds of crates. We push in on a LARGE WOODEN CRATE. The side of the crate STARTS TO FLEX... and SPLINTERS as Jensen breaks out of his box! \nJENSEN And the crowd goes wild... \nINT. / EXT. GOLIATH - SHIPPING ROOM DOOR \nClay and Roque approach. Knock. From the inside, Jensen leaning up against the door. \nAisha's had enough, thumbing the hammer back: \nAISHA Did you kill him? \nClay, about to respond when: COUGAR (O.S.) I did. \nThey turn to see our LONG TALL SNIPER standing above them. \nCOUGAR (CONT'D) He asked us. It was mercy. But you're his family, so I understand. \nAnd then, incredibly, Cougar lays his rifle at her feet. \nSURRENDERING... \nCOUGAR (CONT'D) But only me. \nClay and Jensen blink, shocked. Aisha stares at Cougar, equally surprised. She levels her pistol AT HIS HEAD... Silence. We CUT WIDE to see... \nA GUNSHOT. Muzzle flash from Aisha's gun. COUGAR FALLS... \nIn close again. Aisha stands over Cougar's body. \nThe others, stunned... And then Cougar rises. Face BLOODY. Cheek ripped open, from where the bullet creased his flesh. She FIRES AGAIN - BLAM! \nIdentical scar on his other cheek. Blood runs down his face. He doesn't move to wipe it away. \nAISHA Wear it. Remember him. \nCougar nods. Leans down, picks up his rifle. Debt paid. \nJENSEN Okay, excellent, very tribal--We need to go. \nAs if on cue, BULLETS kick up DUST around them! A new Par-Sec team, incoming. Clay, Jensen, Aisha, and Cougar hightail it back to where Pooch lies. \nCLAY Can you stand? \nPOOCH This is stupid question day, isn't it? It's stupid question day and someone forgot to tell me... \nClay slings Pooch over his shoulders fireman carry style. Looks across the Terminal to where Pooch's van is parked. PUSH IN on Clay's face for: \nCLAY Let's go. \nAnd they do. Sprinting across the open space IN SLO-MO, Cougar and Aisha WASTING EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. A full on ballet of fully automatic mayhem... \nThey make it to the van! Piling in! Cougar behind the wheel GUNS THE ENGINE and they PEEL OUT... \nINT. VAN (MOVING) -- NIGHT \nPulling on to the HIGHWAY. Silence sets in. The high of the firefight, over. Just pain and loss now. \nFive people, some terribly wounded, with nowhere to go. Just the rocking of the van as it heads down the road. \nFINALLY: \nCLAY They won. We lost. Way it goes. \nSilence. \nPOOCH Way it always goes. \nClay looks at him. \nPOOCH (CONT'D) Guess we should just head home. Oh, wait, that's right. We don't have homes. \nClay doesn't respond. Aisha studies him. Nods. Knows what has to be done. They all do. From behind the wheel: \nCOUGAR Where to, Colonel? \nClay looks up at the use of rank... \nEXT. PRIVATE AIRSTRIP -- NIGHT \nWade pulls up in a Corvette. Gets out and walks over as Roque finishes supervising Par-Sec guards finish loading the CASH onto a HUGE TRANSPORT PLANE. \nWADE Your friends jack-rabbitted. Should we be worried? \nROQUE Clay doesn't take risks. It's why I'm here and he's not. \nWADE You're sure? \nRoque nods. \nROQUE It's a distinct possibility... \nThey begin circling one another. Clay, still weaponless. \nROQUE (CONT'D) You don't have a knife? \nCLAY Don't need one. \nROQUE Bit of as longshot for you... \nCLAY (SMILING) No. It's not. \nRoque LUNGES AT HIM... \nBut Clay does have a knife. He PULLS IT and SLAMS IT into Roque's belly! Roque, stunned! Staggers back... \nFor most men, that would be the end of the fight. But not these two. Roque gives Clay a bloody grin. \nROQUE Now I really am gonna cut your head off... \nHe LUNGES AGAIN! And now it is FULLY ON... \nThe blades whip up and down - almost too fast to see Roque gets Clay with a left cross, then buries his knife in Clay's shoulder. Clay twists free, slashes at Roque. \nTen seconds in, the men separate again. Breathing hard... \nClay sees Roque doesn't have his knife. Looks - realizing it's still embedded in his own shoulder. Pulls it out, TOSSES IT BACK TO ROQUE. They stand there, both panting... Then RUN AT EACH OTHER full tilt! \nHere's how it ends. And pay attention, IT HAPPENS FAST: \nClay goes low -- coming up to grab Roque's knife hand, which is arcing DOWNWARDS TOWARDS CLAY'S THROAT -- Clay manages to HALT THE HAND, blade inches from his Adam's apple -- and there's a moment where Roque could overpower him and actually cut his head off... But Clay THROWS HIS WEIGHT FORWARD and BREAKS ROQUE'S RIGHT ARM! \nAnd for the first time, Roque SCREAMS. \nWhich seems to make Clay happy. \nSo he BREAKS ROQUE'S LEFT ARM too. \nRoque falls to his knees, BROKEN, BLOODY, AND BEATEN... TO REVEAL -- The PILOT. Leaning out of the cockpit, DESERT EAGLE levelled at Clay. \nCLAY SHIT- \nThe Pilot PULLS THE TRIGGER. The bullet slams into Clay's abdomen and BLOWS HIM off his feet backwards -- FLYING OUT OF THE PLANE -- And landing on hood of \nTHE CORVETTE \nClay SMASHES DOWN ON the windshield -- Cougar pumps the brakes and spins the wheel -- desperately trying to keep Clay from rolling off the hood... \nTHE PLANE \nTURNING AROUND at the end of the runway. Beginning it's final run to get up to speed... \nTHE CORVETTE \nNow driving TOWARDS IT on a chicken-like collision course when WHOOSH! WADE FLIES PAST ON HIS MOTORCYCLE! Clay turns to Cougar through the spiderwebbed windshield: \nCLAY (CONT'D) Rifle... \nCougar passes Clay his SNIPER RIFLE and FLOORS IT... VISUALIZE THIS -- \nAT ONE END OF THE RUNWAY, the plane starting to take off. \nAT THE OPPOSITE END, Wade's motorcycle heading full speed at the approaching plane. Cougar and Clay, chasing Wade. \nAnd then AISHA steps out INTO THE MIDDLE of the runway. The ROCKET LAUNCHER clutched in her hands. \nShe takes a knee. Aims at the plane, which is almost at lift speed. ROQUE sees her from the cockpit. \nShe locks eyes with him and GRINS -- FIRING into the LANDING GEAR of the plane AS... \nTHE CORVETTE \nPULLS EVEN WITH WADE. Instead of shooting, Clay THROWS Cougar's RIFLE BETWEEN THE SPOKES of Wade's FRONT TIRE, causing the bike to \nCATAPULT WADE OFF and FORWARD... \n...THROUGH THE AIR and into the RIGHT NUMBER TWO JET ENGINE of the now flying cargo plane. The ENGINE EXPLODES. \nAisha, somehow safe on the ground, looking up at the escaping plane. Clay looking up. All of them watching... \n...as Roque dies very badly. \n", "test1_input": "EXT. CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION -- DAY \nWade slumps against the burnt out wreckage of the chase van. Sighing in relief. SILENCE. His radio crackles: \nCHOPPER PILOT (V.O.)

CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- DAY \nThe SWAT Guys pull off their masks and high-five. They think they kicked ass. Fennel, reaching for the cockpit door handle...

CHINOOK COCKPIT -- DAY We hear the FAINT YELLING of Fennel and the Swat Guys in the hold. The Chinook Pilot flips up his goggles to reveal -- \nIt's POOCH! AISHA sitting co-pilot.

The men gather themselves. Weapons up. Checking clips, safeties off. \nFENNEL We're down, okay! You go the second the ramp lowers! Hit them hard, three round bursts, center mass! \nEXT. CHINOOK -- EVENING \nAisha clambers onto the Chinook's hull, clutching a RUBBER HOSE. Screws the end to an inlet valve marked \"FIRE RETARDANT SYSTEM\". Looks down at Clay. With a grin: \nAISHA Open the valve. \nTIGHT ON a 3-inch turn valve. Hard hands grab and open... \nINT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- EVENING \nFENNEL These guys are about to get the surprise of their lives... \nCut off as a CLEAR LIQUID begins to rain down on them from the SPRINKLER SYSTEM... \nFENNEL (CONT'D) What the hell they trying to do, drown us? SOLDIER 1 Sir, that smell! It's- gasoline! \nTheir EYES GO WIDE... \nHYDRAULICS WHINE. The RAMP LOWERS. The gas drenched soldiers BURST OUT, weapons up. Squinting through the fumes... \nCLAY STANDS ALONE. The men fan out around him. Multiple rifles TRAINED AT HIS HEAD from every direction. Fennel blinks, surprised to see him alive. Nevertheless: \nFENNEL Eat the ground, or they blow your head off! \nCLAY I don't think so. \nFENNEL First and only warning, Clay! \nClay calmly LIGHTS A CIGARETTE. TIGHT ON THE BURNING CHERRY: The soldiers, wide eyed... \nCLAY Gasoline. Muzzle flash. Think about it. AS THAT SINKS IN -- Fennel looks like his puppy just died. \nGASOLINE DRIPS from the muzzle of his own tooled up H&K G36 assault rifle... Clay takes a long smooth drag. \nCLAY (CONT'D) Things'll kill you. \nA beat... and then the fight just goes out of the SWAT Team. They DROP THEIR GUNS and RAISE THEIR HANDS... \nCLAY (CONT'D) Good boys. Now, let's see what kind of cargo you got in there. \nFENNEL Clay, no bullshit - you open that box and we all die. Clay steps up to him. Near nose to nose. \nCLAY I'm already dead, remember? \nWHAP! Clay's fist to Fennel's jaw. Knocking him cold. \nCUT TO: \nTIGHT ON FENNEL as he and the Team sit bound and gagged in the back of the Chinook. As the ramp rises, he shoots panicked glances to Clay.

Lifting the casing off the bomb housing - looking down at the MULITITUDE OF COLORED WIRES... \nPOOCH I got wires - red, blue, green, white, yellow- \nJENSEN (STILL TYPING) Okay, just hold position! \nPOOCH There's also pink- JENSEN Hold position! \nHe's typing like the damn wind now -- IMAGES on his laptop, FLYING PAST as he HACKS THE D.O.D... \nAISHA Are you trying to make this more dramatic? \nJENSEN Almost... Almost... Shit! \nAISHA What? JENSEN Computer crashed! \nHis screen, FROZEN. \nPOOCH Are you kidding me? \nJENSEN Yes, cause this is the time for HUMOR- \nCLAY JENSEN- \nJENSEN I told you, I'm not good at bombs! \nCLAY Do you have time to reboot? \n", "test1_id": 2100, "test2_input": "No way. They're fucked. \nPOOCH Okay, someone pick a color! \nAISHA (STRANGELY CALM) Pull out all the wires. ROQUE What? \nAISHA You ever hear of a clock radio that exploded cause you unplugged it--pull out all the wires. \nWith no other options POOCH DOES. The clock, STILL GOING: \nThe end of the wires FIZZLE. Then NOTHING. \nSILENCE. \nJENSEN Opening it without the code must have triggered the timer... \nPOOCH You think? \nAnd then Roque PULLS HIS GUN. Levelling it at Aisha: \nROQUE Did you know? \nAISHA I just saved our lives- \nROQUE (FEVER PITCH) Did you know? \nAISHA Of course not! \nClay TURNS SUDDENLY, stalking towards the Chinook... \nROQUE (CONFUSED) Where the hell are you- \nCLAY Fennel. \nINT. CHINOOK -- WINDOWLESS HOLD -- NIGHT \nThe Losers stand around Fennel, who's been CRYING. Urine stain on his pants. Sniveling, spilling his guts rapidly: FENNEL Max thinks the country's lost it's way, gone soft in the War on Terror! This is his solution! \nClay JAMS A GUN to his temple... \nCLAY Elaborate. \nFENNEL He wanted us to nuke a U.S. target, pin it on the ragheads and boom - freedom is on the march again! The same people who want us to pull back will be screaming to turn the place into a parking lot! POOCH What was the target? \nFENNEL I CAN'T- \nBLAM! Clay FIRES - INCHES FROM Fennel's HEAD! Fennel SCREAMS \nFENNEL (CONT'D) The Mall of America! Christ! \nThey stare down at him in disbelief... \nFENNEL (CONT'D) I'm serious! It's his sense of humor! He told us we could choose between there and Epcot Center... \nA beat as our guys take this in. \nJENSEN (AMAZED) Holy shit, it's like we were framed by Dr. No... \nAISHA What about Goliath? \nJENSEN Yeah, what would an oil company want with the Middle East? \nFENNEL (STILL FREAKED) The ships that service their offshore oil rigs are exempt from US Customs! It's how Max gets the drugs in and out of the country- \nROQUE This is conspiracy theory bullshit- \nFENNEL It's not! There's proof! \nCLAY Where? FENNEL Max's heroin operation - Goliath keeps accounts of the shipments! \nJENSEN Come on, dude, they'd be morons to keep records of shit like this- \nFENNEL It's on a stand-alone hard drive! It's their insurance policy against Max - they know he's crazy, this way they have something on him! \nCLAY So this hard drive - it contains evidence of what Max has been doing? \nFENNEL Yes! \nOur guys exchange looks... \nCLAY Can you get us this drive? \n", "test2_true": "FENNEL I don't know where it is! They don't let me have access! But- \nFennel goes pale when he sees Clay MOVE TOWARD HIM: \nFENNEL (CONT'D) No, wait! Please don't kill- \nClay plasters DUCT TAPE over Fennel's mouth. Stepping outside the Chinook. The others, going with him... \nEXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- NIGHT \nThe Warhead, still sitting there. Nobody speaks for a bit. Then: \nCLAY I say we hit Goliath headquarters. \nROQUE And do what - go after this non- existent hard drive? \nCLAY We find out if it exists. If it does, we steal it and trade it for immunity. \nRoque stares at him. \nROQUE That's your plan? \nCLAY You got a better one? (MORE) \nCLAY (CONT'D) Max gives us back our lives or we upload the data to the net, show the American people what's being done in their names. \nROQUE Why risk our lives again when we already have something to trade? \nHe gestures to the WARHEAD. Clay, shocked. \nCLAY You want to give it back to him? \nROQUE I want to at least discuss it before signing up for another suicide mission on the say-so of some flunky- \nCLAY It's not happening. \nRoque blinks at Clay's abruptness. Pissed. \nROQUE So you want to take down Goliath now? Then who? McDonald's? American Airlines? Microsoft? \nCLAY You don't want Max to pay? \nROQUE I want my life back! This is supposed to be us getting clear - not saving the world! \nPOOCH ROQUE- \nROQUE We're not the goddamn good guys anymore! I love you guys, but I had a life before this shit, and I sure as hell am not going to risk getting it back because you came down with a case of the Dudley Damn Do-Rights! \nCLAY Don't raise your voice at me- \nROQUE I will raise whatever the hell I want - you got a death wish because you got beat by a voice on a radio- \nWHAP! Clay throws a STRAIGHT RIGHT to Roque's jaw! Roque, surprised and staggered by the blow... Then he SMILES through the blood, DRAWING A KNIFE: \nROQUE (CONT'D) I'm gonna cut your head off... \nThis got serious quick. Pooch steps between them. A really dangerous beat... \nClay and Roque, full on eyefucking one another... \nOn Aisha - she seems to be DIGGING IT... Broken by: \nPOOCH I say we hit Goliath. Jensen? \nJENSEN Goliath. Cougs? \nCougar nods. \nCLAY Aisha? \nROQUE She doesn't get a vote- \nAISHA (staring at Roque) Goliath. \nSilence. Roque, ODD MAN OUT. His fingers tighten around the handle of the knife... \nPOOCH (SOFTLY) Put it away... \nA long beat... and Roque slides the knife back into it's SCABBARD. Clay, staring at him: \nCLAY You want your life back, you're gonna have to steal it. We hit them in two days. \n", "test2_id": 2101, "test3_input": "...And landing in an EMPTY ROOM. \nNo computers. No stand-alone drives. No nothing. Except for PAR-SEC GUARDS with weapons trained at his head... \nINT. CHEVY VAN - GOLIATH TERMINAL \nPooch sitting in the van, into the radio: \nPOOCH Jensen, you get it? Jensen? \nDoes not see the FIVE PAR-SEC SOLDIERS moving in on his car, long guns up and out... EXT. GOLIATH OIL TANK - SAME \nCougar flexed and aimed. Scope locked in on the fire alarm... CLICK! Safety off on a gun pressed to his temple. Fuck. He LAYS DOWN THE GUN and puts his hands behind his head. Furious at himself for GETTING CAUGHT... \nINT. GOLIATH SHIPPING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nFrom the shadows, WADE ENTERS. Clay looks up at him. \nWADE Hello, Clay. Been awhile. (NODDING) Roque. \nHead wounds bleed bad. The crowbar caused a mother of a gusher on Clay. He wipes blood from his eyes. Manages: CLAY When...? \nROQUE After the truck. I got tired of waiting for you to save us, so I up and saved myself. Reached out like I said and cut a deal - I set this up, I go free. \nHe begins walking around Clay as he talks. \nCLAY Traitor... \nROQUE You gave me no choice. It was always gonna end like this, Clay. Us captured or dead. It was always a dead end. You made sure of it. \nCLAY (SPITTING BLOOD) Bullshit... \nROQUE Not bullshit. You were gonna keep planning missions and ways to hit Max until it got us all killed. \nCLAY No... \nROQUE Yes, Clay. Yes. Only difference with this situation is at least I get to walk away. \nCLAY We all could have walked... used the drive... \nROQUE Don't you get it yet? There is no drive. There never was... \nWade BEGINS LAUGHING. Clay looks like he's been slapped. \nROQUE (CONT'D) Fennel made it up to save himself. When I told Wade, he planted the info at Goliath to lead you here. \nClay stares at him. \nROQUE (CONT'D) You really thought there was a happy ending coming? Pooch was gonna get his family back, we were gonna get to be soldiers again? (leans down; softly) We lost the moment we went off mission. This is just the logical conclusion of that playing out. You didn't want to hear it. (MORE) \nROQUE (CONT'D) You just wanted your revenge. Your face-to-face with the big bad wolf. I'm sorry, buddy, but it's the way of the world... \nRoque straightens back up, shaking his head: \nROQUE (CONT'D) Guys like us don't beat guys like him. \nIn the corner, Wade nods at this. Behind him, A LARGE SEMI pulls up to the CASH CONTAINER. Over the following, a hydraulic lift hoists the cash container onto the truck: CLAY Kill me now... Maybe you live through this. \nWADE Oh, we're not gonna kill you. Someone's gotta get away with the cash. Your crew? I'm definitely wasting them. But you? \nHe nods to the HYDRO-WINCH slowly lowering the CASH CONTAINER onto the flat bed, with a smile... \nWADE (CONT'D) You're about to steal a billion dollars from the Central Intelligence Agency. \nClay stares at daggers at both of them. WADE (CONT'D) It's for our replacement nuke. When a billion goes missing, people tend to ask who took it. (CHUCKLING) Max really does love to frame you... \nSeveral Par-Sec Guards arrive. Wade points to Clay: \nWADE (CONT'D) Take him away. Drop him in Newark. (TO ROQUE) I'll see you at Turner Airfield. \nThe Guards handcuff Clay and drag him to his feet. Pushing him towards the door. As he hustled past Roque: \nROQUE Wait. \nThey stop. Roque looks at his old friend. \nROQUE (CONT'D) I'm sorry it had to end this way. \nClay stares back at him. \nCLAY You're going to die very badly. The guards hustle Clay out the door... \n", "test3_true": "PAR-SEC GUARDS lead the Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar towards the far end of the terminal. Each, bound. Cougar looks up to see a separate set of Guards leading CLAY the opposite way. Their eyes connect - both knowing: \nThey've lost. \nCLAY (answering the question) Roque. \nCougar lowers his head, sadly. Clay's pushed into A TRUCK. \nGone. The Guards take Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar BEHIND A WAREHOUSE. Looking at each other. Knowing, this is the end of the line. The Lead Guard RACKS HIS MACHINE GUN. \nLEAD GUARD On your knees. \nPooch SPITS AT HIM. The Lead Guard calmly SHOOTS HIM in BOTH LEGS! \nPooch SCREAMS. Falls. The Par-Sec boys force Cougar and Jensen down too, CLUBBING THEM with their rifles. Pooch looks up at his assailant. Gasps through the pain: \nPOOCH Get on with it... \nThe Lead Guard smiles. Looks to Cougar, who's shredding his skin to the bone trying to claw out of the cuffs... \nLEAD GUARD That's a nice hat. \nHe steps forward to take it, but Cougar is too quick for the man, MOVING HIS HEAD AWAY. He reaches for Cougar again. Again, Cougar evades. The guards laugh at their colleague, who continues trying to grab Cougar's hat. \nThe Lead Guard has had enough of Cougar's antics. Levelling the rifle at his head... \nLEAD GUARD (CONT'D) Don't really care of there's a hole in it. One wash, good as... (NOTICING) What are you smiling at? \nCougar's nods past him... \nAs the Guards turn to see ON TOP OF AN OIL TANK... \nAISHA \nAs she rises up to standing, A SLANT-K 600 ROCKET HIP BLASTER locked and loaded. Looking like an Old Testament style Goddess of Vengeance and Destruction. A moment of FROZEN SHOCK on the rest of Wade's Hit Crew... \nAnd she pulls the trigger. A HIGH PITCHED WHISTLE as \nTHE ROCKET STREAKS across the Terminal! Headed straight for an ENORMOUS FUEL TANK... KA-BOOM! The explosion ROCKS THE ENTIRE TERMINAL... \nINT. TRUCK (MOVING) \nThe Truck Clay is prisoner in is BLOWN INTO THE AIR by the SHOCKWAVE... SMASHING down onto it's side, skidding... \nEXT. BY THE WAREHOUSE \nCougar and Jensen DESTROY the remaining Par-Secs with legs. Grabbing cuff keys and freeing themselves. \nJENSEN Shouldn't have gone after the hat... \nWHAM! Cougar kicks the Guard in the face, knocking him cold. Aisha rappels off the Oil Tower in the distance. VARIOUS PAR-SEC TEAMS fire at her! Cougar scoops up two rifles and tosses one to Jensen - they give her covering fire as she comes! As he shoots, to the wounded Pooch: \nJENSEN (CONT'D) Can you stand? \nPOOCH I've been shot in both legs, what kind of dumbass question is that? \nJENSEN Oh, so we're Mr. Grumpy now? You're not the only one who's been shot recently, you know! \nHe empties a full clip into a Par-Sec team and reloads... \nAISHA -- Pinned down forty yards away. Almost out of AMMO. Par-Sec Team, almost on top of her when \nA FIGURE emerges from an OVERTURNED TRUCK. GUN in each hand, BLAZING. The Par-Secs cut down one by one. The figure lowers his guns. Desert Eagles. Walks up to her. Underneath the blood, oil, and grime, it's \nCLAY. They stare at each other... \nThen, incredibly, Aisha RAISES HER WEAPON AT HIM. \nAISHA Did you kill my father? Jensen comes running up, interrupting: \nJENSEN Clay? \nCLAY Kind of in the middle of something here, Jensen- \nAISHA Did you kill him? \nJENSEN There was no drive, Clay- \nCLAY (eyes on Aisha) I KNOW- \nJENSEN There was no drive and Roque's gone and Par-Sec's regrouping and Pooch could bleed out- \n", "test3_id": 2102}

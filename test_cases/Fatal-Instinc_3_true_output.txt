NED You what? 
Lola CLAPS her hands twice and all the LIGHTS COME ON. She smiles at him... drops her car keys on the hall table, then goes up the stairs. 
Ned drops his car keys on the table too and follows her. 
EXT. PORCH OFF BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Lola clicks on a porch light. She and Ned step out. Dozens of small boxes hang around the perimeter of the porch. 
LOLA My wind chimes. 
Ned steps over, running his hands along the boxes. They "thud" against each other. 
NED You know, these would work a lot better if you took them out of the boxes. 
He slips several boxes off, releasing clusters of the metal chimes. They "tinkle" and "clang" melodically in the breeze. 
LOLA Well well... I guess you have been around. I'm impressed. 
She moves close, coming on to him. Ned feels uneasy. 
NED Why don't we take a look at those... papers? 
LOLA (remembering) Papers. Right. 
INT. DRESSING AREA OFF BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Lola comes in, looks around, then down. She removes her shoe, pulling off two scraps of paper stuck to the gum on her heel. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Ned is looking through a book... "KAMIKAZE KAMA SUTRA - The Encyclopedia of Deadly Sexual Positions." Lola comes back in, hands Ned the two scraps of paper. 
NED That's it? These are the... papers? 
LOLA Yes. They're so confusing to me. Can you tell me what they are? 
He checks them out... shrugs. It's obvious. 
NED This one's a laundry receipt... and the other one's an expired lottery ticket. 
He hands them back to her, but she gently pushes them away. 
LOLA No. You keep them... as a memento of our time together. 
She slips them into his jacket pocket... then sensuously slides her hands around him, grabbing his buns, pulling him closer. 
LOLA I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay you for all you've done? 
NED Cash would be nice. 
LOLA Isn't there some other way? 
NED I suppose you could wash my car. 
LOLA No, I mean, isn't there something else you want? Something I could give you? 
She seductively starts to slide the jacket off his shoulders. 
NED Hey... slow down... there's a speed limit in this state. Sixty-five miles an hour. 
LOLA How fast was I going, officer? 
NED Oh, about a hundred and twenty-three. 
LOLA Suppose you pull me over and frisk me? 
NED Suppose I let you off with a warning? 
LOLA Suppose I find a cop with a bigger nightstick? 
NED Suppose I put you under arrest for being a bad girl with bad thoughts? 
LOLA Suppose you handcuff me to the bed? 
NED (rapid run-on) Suppose I do and then we lose the key and while I'm gone to get a duplicate made the house catches on fire and I can't get back to save you because the bridge is washed out and so you die a horrible death toasted like a Polish sausage on a flaming spit! (shakes his head) Nah... I better be going. 
He turns and leaves. She is stunned, confused, breathless. 
EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 
Ned opens the door, pauses, turns... as Lola joins him there. She looks into his eyes with desire. 
LOLA You're not so tough. Last chance. 
She moves her lips close to his, about to kiss him. Then... 
NED No thanks. I got a cold shower and a wife who trusts me waiting at home. 
LOLA What's the matter? Don't you want me? It's the way I look, isn't it?

BRAND I've got you. 
Creatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as if imitating them. 
Cooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool. 
INT. CAVE -- NIGHT 
Brand CRACKS a glow stick, basking the cave around them in a soft light. 
As they watch, horrified, the pool and the rocks in front of the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal. 
For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed. Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps its way toward the entrance to the cave. Another follows, and another, until the cave entrance is full. 
Cooper looks around the cave, frantic. He picks up a rock. Brand, scared but still thinking, takes the rock from his hand and drops it back to the ground. 
BRAND It's game theory. The best move is always to cooperate at first. 
COOPER By "cooperate" do you mean let it eat me? 
BRAND These organisms have no interest in us. They survive by photosynthesis. All they need is light. 
COOPER Then why are they killing each other? 
BRAND I don't know. (LOOKS AROUND) But we're outnumbered, Cooper. So unless you have a better idea, I suggest we make nice. 
The creatures move toward them hesitantly, then faster. 
Cooper stands stock still as the creatures gather around him. Several of them join up into bigger animals to get a better look at him. 
One of them wraps itself around his chest and begins prodding at his shoulders, then his neck. 
COOPER (trying to be calm) What is it doing? 
BRAND It's a colony organism. It's trying to incorporate you into its structure. 
COOPER I don't want it to incorporate me. 
BRAND Don't open your mouth. 
COOPER WHY N- 
As he speaks, the creature on his chest extends four spindly, pointed feelers and reaches gently into his mouth. 
Cooper holds his breath as the organism taps against his teeth. Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete, and it appears to be searching for the same texture on Cooper's skin, without much luck. 
Bored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. The last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away. 
Cooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he and Brand are left alone again. 
Brand steps to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated, as the creatures resume wrestling and battling each other. 
COOPER (CONT'D) They're killing each other. 
BRAND No. They don't bleed... they don't die... they're just competing... trying out different shapes, looking for the best one. 
Cooper watches as a hideously-awkward-looking, five-legged beast stumbles past and tackles another animal. 
COOPER I'd say they have a long way to go. 
BRAND (AMAZED) They do this every night. 
As they watch, a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw scuttles along the ground, grabbing smaller opponents and smashing them apart, then sorting through the wreckage and adopting some of the writhing parts as its own. 
Something about the movement is endearing, the way it experiments with each piece -- less like a massacre and more like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set. 
Suddenly, a massive, lumbering creature SMASHES down in front of the claw beast. No match, the smaller creature turns to scuttle away. Too slow. The larger organism brings one club-like limb smashing down on top of it. After a moment, it lifts its claw -- the two animals have become one. 
The new organism lumbers away through the jungle, happily snapping its new claw at larger opponents. 
BRAND (CONT'D) The behavior changes as the animals get bigger and bigger. More sophisticated. More calculated. 
Two of the larger organisms square off, circling each other, lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display. 
COOPER But what are they competing for? 
BRAND I don't know. 
Brand shivers -- it's getting colder. 
INT. CAVE -- NIGHT 
Brand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've brought with them. 
Brand looks at the sample of the fractal wildlife in her case. It's moving around, splitting apart, reforming, trying to find a way out. 
BRAND These creatures are billions of years older than we are. But they're relatively primitive. They haven't developed tools, culture, language. 
COOPER Why not? 
BRAND I don't know. No one knows how intelligent life began on Earth. But the surface of this planet has virtually no craters. No impacts. It's been sheltered by the local black holes. 
COOPER What difference would that make? 
BRAND Maybe not enough has gone wrong here. Maybe bad luck is the key to intelligent life. 
COOPER (QUIETLY) Murph's Law. 
BRAND Exactly. Maybe our interaction with them will push them over the top. Maybe that's part of the plan. 
COOPER (shakes his head) The plan. 
BRAND Why is it so hard for you to accept that someone might be trying to help us? 
Cooper is silent for a moment. His mood darkens. 
COOPER I was in Denver during the first year of the famine. I was just a kid. We kept waiting for someone to come help us. People starved to death sitting on the ground, waiting for someone to come. (MORE) 
COOPER (CONT'D) (looks at her) I only made it because I realized that nobody was coming to save us. We were on our own. 
Cooper looks away. The memories are never that far away. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Honestly? After the things I saw... you want to know why I don't believe that someone would be trying to help us? Because I'm not sure we're worth saving. 
They sit in silence for a while. 
EXT. CAVE -- NIGHT 
Cooper sleeps. After a moment, Brand steps back out into the darkness. 
EXT. PLAIN -- DAWN 
Brand exhales great streams of frosted breath -- the temperature is well below freezing. The first flickers of light are visible in the ice above.

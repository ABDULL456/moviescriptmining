SAM ROGERS No... never.... not even close. 
SAM takes a deep drag off his cigarette. 
PETER Oh... 
SAM ROGERS Yeah. 
PETER looks down at his watch, then thinks about what to say next. 
PETER Do you really think this is the only... or the... right thing to do? 
SAM ROGERS For who? 
PETER I'm not sure. 
Now SAM looks around and thinks. 
SAM ROGERS I'm not either. 
PETER So this is gonna make a pretty big mess of it, then? 
SAM ROGERS I don't even want to think about it. 
(CONTINUED) 62   CONTINUED: (5)                                                 62 
PETER Yeah. 
SAM ROGERS Just doesn't quite seem... 
Takes another long drag. 
PETER I know. 
SAM ROGERS (Very slightly shakes his head.) 
PETER Well. I guess we should get back. 
SAM ROGERS Yeah. 
They both stand in place for a long beat then finally turn and head into the building. 
INT. LOBBY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 
The camera follows them through the long marble lobby. Through security. They comfortably don't talk to each other the entire time till they get into the elevator. 
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
Staring ahead in silence. 
SAM ROGERS Well good luck, you know, in the future... Seems like you'll probably be just fine. 
PETER Thank you. 
The doors open. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
INT. EXECUTIVE BATHROOM STALL 
A very tight shot of SETH sitting fully clothed on the toilet with the lid on. He is crying very, very intensely but almost silently. He puts his head in his hands and just once or twice lets out a loud noise. 
(CONTINUED) 65   CONTINUED:                                                     65 
Eventually someone comes into the room and he hears the person go over to the sink and start running water. SETH tries to stop himself from crying. Eventually he accepts that the guy is not leaving and he comes out of the stall and walks over to the sinks. JARED is standing in front of the mirror with his shirt off shaving. His new shirt and tie are on a hanger next to him. SETH walks up to a sink next to him and it is very obvious that he has been crying. He undoes his collar and starts to wash his face. Finally JARED speaks. 
JARED COHEN You alright? 
SETH sends him a dagger of a look through the reflection in the mirror. 
SETH You just fired me.

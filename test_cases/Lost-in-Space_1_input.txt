Robot is on line. 
(OVER) a KNOCKING has begun. WILL looks up, puzzled. 
WILL 
It sounds like old morse code. 
Chapter 18: Danger Will! 
INT.-CORRIDOR 
Will walks down the corridor. (OVER) The KNOCKING continues. Will follows the SOUND until he comes to the door of Smith's prison. 
Smith is visible through the door window, sitting at a table, hammering out the code with his boot. He beckons Will inside. 
Will shakes his head. Smith begins TAPPING again. 
WILL 
(sounding out the code) 
Danger. 
INT.-SMITH'S CELL 
The door slides open and Will ENTERS, a laser pistol in hand. 
WILL 
You said someone is in danger. 
SMITH 
We all are. You are wise to arm yourself. 
Smith eyes the weapon, moving towards the boy. 
WILL 
This gun is set to fire for me only so don't try anything funny. 
Smith barely misses a beat as he adjusts, passing the child, going instead to the window and opening the blast shield. 
SMITH 
William, you misjudge me. I only want to help you. 
WILL 
Help us? You tried to kill us all. 
SMITH 
But now our fates are intertwined. if your father and that idiot West fail, I will have no chance of getting home. It is in my best interests they succeed. And I always follow my best interests. 
Smith gazes out at the exotic terrain. (OVER) an inhuman WAIL. 
SMITH 
What monsters roam these alien wilds? Fools. To set off blindly across this savage land. Much as I hate to admit it, it will be harder to manage without them. 
WILL 
What are you talking about? They'll be back. They'll be okay. 
Smith is silent. A long, lethal beat. 
WILL 
Someone should go after them. 
SMITH 
Will, I forbid it. You're a boy. A clever one, certainly, but a child nonetheless. This planet is likely full of predators. Even if you found them, what if they're hurt, ravaged, dying, what good could you do? 
WILL 
But you're a doctor. 
Smith turns away, hiding his smile. 
EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY 
Judy and Maureen are hanging on repelling lines before the crater wall, shipping away ore that glitters like diamonds. 
JUDY 
It's impossible. 
MAUREEN 
Not really. Geologists have speculated that Dimondium might be naturally occurring in many older worlds. Part of a biosphere's way of rejuvenating itself. 
JUDY 
This one is ten times more powerful then that on Alpha Prime. There's enough here to save Earth. 
Penny stands in the f.g. with Blip on her arm, taking plant samples, talking into her video recorder. 
PENNY 
After much deliberation, the Space Captive has decided to accept her new role as member of the crew. The Robinsons, after all, can  obviously use her help... 
Blip jumps up on Penny's arm, knocking her recorder to the ground. 
PENNY 
(flaring) 
Now look what you've done. Stop hanging all over me. 
Blip stares at her, frightened by her tone, begins backing away to the edge of the forest. She looks at Penny, then disappears into the thick brush.. 
PENNY 
Blip. Wait. I'm sorry. Damn. 
Penny heads after the creature. HOLD on her recorder. Forgotten. 
CHAPTER 19: A Different Future 
EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY 
Will and Smith are walking down a forest path. The boy has a radiation tracker in his hand. 
WILL 
I've got a fix on Dad's suit beacon. 
Dead ahead is a field of beautiful, alien flowers, their purple leaves moving in the wind like an azure sea. 
WILL 
Wow, that's Mom's favorite color. 
SMITH 
How droll. 
(OVER) a tremendous RUMBLING. The WIND ROARS. Suddenly, the air in the distance begins to twist, a rushing distortion sweeping towards them, flowers growing, landscape aging rapidly within. 
SMITH 
Run, child, run. 
Smith turns, begins to flee, pulling Will with him, away from the rushing warp. Smith trips, falls, closes his eyes, waiting for the distortion to overtake him. A beat. He opens his eyes. 
SMITH-POV. A glowing, stationary portal shimmers behind him, revealing beyond a forest ever older, darker, more overgrown.

BEHIND THEM 
Oxford enters. They don't notice, though. He instantly realizes he shouldn't say anything. He listens as: 
WIDER 
ESSEX (CONT'D) Think, Henry, if James owes Cecil his throne, Cecil will have more influence in the next reign than he does in this one. And after William Cecil, his hunch-backed son will take his place... (careful) That is why we must do everything in our power to ensure that the right man succeeds her. (beat) A man deserving of the Tudor crown. 
Southampton stiffens at that last phrase. 
ESSEX (CONT'D) I ask you for the support of you and your men, Henry.... if it comes to a fight. 
pg. 19 
Southampton looks at Essex hard. 
SOUTHAMPTON You know you need not ask. I stand with you, as I always have. 
Essex smiles at him warmly. They both HEAR something shuffle behind them. They turn, and see: 
WHERE OXFORD WAS STANDING 
Nothing.   He is gone. 
BACK TO SOUTHAMPTON AND ESSEX 
They exchange a slightly worried look. 
CUT TO: 
20   EXT. ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                                         20 
Moments later, Oxford and Southampton are exiting the elaborate building that serves as Essex's London residence. 
OXFORD Essex played rather poorly, didn't he? 
Southampton just nods, distracted.   Oxford reaches out to him, and touches his shoulder. 
OXFORD (CONT'D) (warning) Henry... The Cecils brook no rivals. 
Southampton pauses, confused for an instant, then-- 
SOUTHAMPTON (re: his discussion with Essex) You heard? 
Oxford nods. 
SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D) Always concerned for me, aren't you Edward? 
They keep walking towards Southampton's men. 
SOUTHAMPTON (CONT'D) And what would you have me do? 
pg. 20 
OXFORD I would have you deny him. 
SOUTHAMPTON The son of the Queen? 
OXFORD That is rumor only, Henry-- 
They stop. Southampton makes sure that his men are out of earshot. 
SOUTHAMPTON Rumor? My god, all you have to do is look at Essex to see the Queen's reflection. Everyone thinks he's her son, everyone! And I for one would rather bow to a Tudor, bastard though he may be, than a Scotsman! 
OXFORD I desire nothing more than to see the next king be the rightful king. But what Essex contemplates will surely lead to Civil War. (beat) No. If this is to be done, it must be done carefully, skillfully. 
SOUTHAMPTON As I heard it, Elizabeth exiled you from her presence for the last twenty years because of your "skill" at Court politics. 
And then he feels instantly ashamed of having said that. 
OXFORD I only have your interests in mind, Henry. For as you so rightly point out, my interests are already lost. 
SOUTHAMPTON I know. Forgive me. You know how I feel about you. You have been a great friend to me ever since my father died. I promise you that I will do nothing rash without consulting you first. 
Oxford nods, still worried, and Southampton heads for his horse. 
pg. 21 
OXFORD Henry! Will you do me one thing more? Deliver a gift for me? A rather... elaborate gift? 
21   EXT. CECIL HOUSE - SUNSET                                  21 
The stone house is nothing like a stereotypical Tudor house; it's enormous, and very ornate and intricate in design. 
It faces the river, and has an elaborate docking area which is now filled with all sorts of longboats letting the noblemen off for a week-end get away. 
22   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DUSK                       22 
Most of England's nobility is assembled in small groups, talking. It's a dour, quiet affair. Some music, no life. Quite Puritan. 
Southampton is there, but Essex and Oxford are nowhere to be seen. 
A HUNCH-BACKED MAN 
--makes his way through the room, causing conversations to cease as he walks by. Even the most senior of the nobles bow their heads slightly in greeting him. This is Sir ROBERT CECIL (mid 30's). 
He pauses near Southampton. 
SOUTHAMPTON Sir Robert. 
ROBERT CECIL My lord of Southampton. (looking around) Have you seen Essex? 
SOUTHAMPTON I believe he is still in the viewing chamber with her majesty... 
ROBERT CECIL (sharp, annoyed) Alone? 
pg. 22 
SOUTHAMPTON (smiles) With your father in London dealing with all the troubles in Ireland, who else should the Queen turn to but Essex? 
Robert Cecil looks annoyed, but holds his tongue as the SOUND of pikes HITTING the floor silences the hall.

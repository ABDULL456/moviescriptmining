JACOB yells. 
JACOB Louis! I'm here! In here! 
INT.  JACOB'S ROOM - DAY 
LOUIS storms through JACOB's door followed by several NURSES and ORDERLIES. 
JACOB LOUIS! 
NURSE 1 You can't go in there! 
ORDERLY You're going to have to leave. 
LOUIS stares furiously at JACOB stretched out on the traction apparatus. He begins to yell. 
LOUIS Good God, Jake. What have they done? (he examines JACOB and screams at the NURSES) What is this, the Middle Ages? And they call this modern medicine. This is barbaric! Barbaric! (turning to JACOB) It's okay, Jake. It's not serious. I'll get you out of here. (yelling at the ORDERLY) What is this, the Inquisition? Why don't you just burn him at the stake and put him out of his misery? 
LOUIS charges over to the traction equipment and begins working the pulleys that suspend JACOB over the bed. The NURSES and ORDERLIES become instantly hysterical and start screaming. 
ORDERLY What the hell do you think ... ? 
LOUIS Don't you come near me. 
NURSE 2 You can't do that! 
LOUIS What is this, a prison? Stay back. 
NURSE 1 You can't. Call the police. 
One of the ORDERLIES lunges at LOUIS who swings back at him with one of the pulley chains. It just misses. 
LOUIS (to the ORDERLIES) You take one step and I'll wrap this around your neck. 
LOUIS lowers JACOB into a wheelchair while holding the others at bay. 
LOUIS (continuing) Hold on, Jake, we're getting out of here. 
NURSES and ORDERLIES part as he pushes him quickly from the room. 
OMIT 
INT.  CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - EVENING 
LOUIS helps JACOB over to an adjusting table in a room that, compared with the hospital, is comfortable and serene. He pushes a lever and the table rises to a vertical position. JACOB leans against it and rides it down to a horizontal position. Every moment is agony for him. 
LOUIS Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words. (JACOB barely hears them) Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you? 
JACOB (nearly whispering) Am I dead, Louis? (LOUIS leans over to hear) Am I dead? 
LOUIS (smiling) From a slipped disc? That'd be a first. 
JACOB I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis. 
LOUIS Well, I'll see what I can do about it. 
JACOB I've seen it. It's all pain. 
LOUIS (working on JACOB's spine like a master mechanic) You ever read Meister Eckart? (JACOB shakes his head "no") How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart? (LOUIS takes hold of JACOB's legs and yanks them swiftly) Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side. 
JACOB turns to his left. LOUIS shakes his head in dismay. 
LOUIS The other "right," okay? (he helps JACOB turn over) You're a regular basket case, you know that? (he moves JACOB's arm over his head) Eckart saw Hell, too. 
LOUIS positions JACOB's other arm, bends his legs, and then pushes down on his thigh. His spine moves with a cracking sound. JACOB groans. 
LOUIS (continuing) You know what he said? The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of your life; your memories, your attachments. They burn 'em all away. But they're not punish- ing you, he said. They're freeing your soul. Okay, other side. 
He helps JACOB and repositions him. Again he pushes and the spine cracks. 
LOUIS (continuing) Wonderful. So the way he sees it, if you're frightened of dying and hold- ing on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth. It's just a matter of how you look at it, that's all. So don't worry, okay? Relax. Wiggle your toes. 
JACOB's toes dance as LOUIS gives him a quick, unexpected jab to the lower vertebrae in his back. 
LOUIS (continuing) Perfect. We got it. (LOUIS pushes a lever and the table rises back up) Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand. 
JACOB What? By myself? 
LOUIS You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try. 
JACOB steps cautiously away from the table. He moves hesitantly, with deliberate restraint. LOUIS encourages him like a faith healer coaxing the lame. His first steps have an aura of the miraculous about them. JACOB walks slowly, without help. LOUIS smiles impishly. He looks like a giant cherub. 
LOUIS Hallelujah. 
LOUIS puts his arm around him. Then JACOB tries again, gradually rediscovering his balance and strength. With each step his confidence returns. LOUIS is pleased. Then, suddenly, without warning, JACOB turns and heads toward the door. 
LOUIS What are you doing? 
JACOB There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.

DR. BRONSCHWEIG This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest. 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen. 
DR. BRONSCHWEIG Of what? 
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community. (beat) Maybe a small roadside memorial. 
He watches the CSM exit, then back to the prostrate fireman. 
CLOSE ON PROSTRATE FIREMAN 
There is more movement within his body. Within his chest and neck, as if the creature gestating inside is continuing to stretch and grow. So that now we can see one of its BLACK EYES staring from through the clear flesh of the fireman. An eye which BLINKS at us. As we:

INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Mulder and Scully appear at the end of a long hall. Moving TOWARD CAMERA where a YOUNG NAVAL GUARD sits in f.g. As a LEGEND appears, to establish. 
Mulder and Scully moving the long distance to the Guard's station. Where the Guard looks up at them with military scrutiny. 
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD ID and floor you're visiting. 
They both show their FBI IDs. 
MULDER We're going to the morgue. 
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel. 
MULDER On whose orders? 
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD General McAddie's. 
Mulder doesn't miss a beat. 
MULDER General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately. 
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD I don't know anything about that. 
MULDER Well, call General McAddie. 
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD I don't have his number. 
MULDER They can patch you in through the switchboard. 
The Guard is nervous about this, checking his watch. He picks up the phone, going through a large directory. 
MULDER Hey! We don't have time to dick around here watching you demonstrate your ignorance in the chain of command. The order came direct from General McAddie. Call him. We'll conduct our business while you confirm authorization. 
Mulder is already directing Scully past the Naval Guard who tentatively picks up the phone again. 
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD (to their backs) Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization. 
MULDER Thank you. 
LEADING Mulder and Scully, moving they've pulled off a con. 
MULDER Why is a morgue suddenly off limits on orders of a general? 
CUT TO: 
INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - MORGUE FREEZER - NIGHT 
TRACKING TABLE HEIGHT across gurneys where white sheet-wrapped bodies lie. CAMERA LANDING ON Scully. Standing next to Mulder who is undoing the peculiar ropey stitching on the sheet used to secure the bodies. 
SCULLY This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas? 
MULDER According to this tag. 
SCULLY And you're looking for? 
SCULLY I can tell you that without even looking at him. (off Mulder's look) Conclusive organ failure due to proximal exposure to source and flying debris. 
Scully pulls out an autopsy report that was laid on the gurney under the body of the sheet-wrapped corpse. 
SCULLY This body has already been autopsied, Mulder. You can tell from the way it's been wrapped and dressed. 
Undeterred, Mulder works to get the sheet off. The first thing we notice is that he's still in his fireman's uniform. His face looks familiar to us, not because we know him, but because of the translucency of skin we saw in the other fireman. (We will also notice he's missing an arm, a leg and large part of his torso.) 
MULDER Does this fit the description you just read me, Scully? 
Scully comes around, reacting to what she sees. 
SCULLY Oh my God. This man's tissue... 
Scully is quickly removing a pair of latex gloves, stretching them on to palpate the man's tissue.

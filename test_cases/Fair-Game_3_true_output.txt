CUT TO: 
INT. LANGLEY MESS. DAY. 
With some colleagues, Valerie in the mess watching -- 
COLIN POWELL'S PERFORMANCE in New York at the U.N. 
Aluminium tubes. Yellowcake. The Nuclear program. 
She watches motionless. She looks at Mike. 
INT. SA'AD'S HOUSE. BAGHDAD. NIGHT. 
Sa'ad sits in his kitchen while his wife plays with the children next door. HE IS WATCHING THE SAME THING: Colin Powell in the U.N. He catches his wife's eye through the open door. Slowly he shakes his head. 
Our eye moves off - across the TV - past the photo of SAWSAN and daughter - out of the window to the street outside. 
Cars. Buses. Stalls. Children playing. The end of a long day. 
SLOWLY THE SHOT DECAYS IN A TIME DISSOLVE to 
NIGHT -- THREE MONTHS LATER -- 
In the full force of an air-raid. Many of the same buildings are gone. The whole world shakes and trembles as a PAVEWAY GE101 laser guided bomb streaks in and impacts.. 
Dust. Shrapnel. Cars on fire. A vision of utter hell. 
A FIGURE -- DARTS BETWEEN BURNING CARS, clutching a bag of food, amid the firestorm. He disappears into our building. Our eye leaves the street - back inside: Sa'ad bursts in as - 
Another missile lands nearby. The building shakes. The picture of Sawsan shifts. Dust falls like fine rain over the small kitchen. Sa'ad unpacks food on the rickety table. Under it, his wife, children cower. He passes down bread. Cheese. The baby is crying. 
There is a KNOCK AT THE DOOR. On the other side are two men. 
SA'AD What you doing? They're watching- 
SCIENTIST No one's watching. Not anymore. I think the Secret Police have their hands full. 
SCIENTIST 2 We're free. Free to be blown to smithereens. 
SA'AD Least no Mukbarat gets to watch it. 
They all laugh at the gallows humor. And hug 
SA'AD It's good to see you, my dear fellow doctors... 
CUT TO: 
SA'AD children, sleeping in bunks. 
CUT TO: 
Next door. The three nuclear scientists are drinking tea at the same table. 
SA'AD My sister said the Americans could get us over the border. 
SCIENTIST And you trust them? Open your eyes. 
SCIENTIST 2 And your ears. Your American friends are calling you right now. 
The rumble of the now distant bombs. Small arms fire. 
SA'AD It's our only hope. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PARKING LOT. LANGLEY. NIGHT. 
BILL, Valerie's chief walks to his car. Valerie shouts after- 
VALERIE Bill. Wait up. 
CUT TO: 
They talk by his car. Valerie is agitated. 
BILL Val, every Mobile Exploration Team is combing the desert looking for WMD. I can't- 
VALERIE                            BILL All I need's a couple units      We're at full stretch Val. to bring these men and their     Listen to me.. families into Camp Lima and on an air transport into Annandale. 
BILL Say we extract these guys. Bring `em home. Put `em on CNN. What are they going to tell us that the White House wants to hear? "Thank you oh and by the way there was no nuclear programme. There's no WMD. PS you all knew that." You want me to go to the DCI, ask him to sign off on his own funeral?

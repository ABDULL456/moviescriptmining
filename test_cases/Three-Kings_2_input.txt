Suddenly, THE SOUND of an APPROACHING TANK. They turn. 
A tank rolls toward them fast, down a narrow side street, followed by a truck with a rocket launcher. 
TROY Great, a fucking tank. That should send us on our way. 
VIG Grenade launcher, sir. 
Vig struggles to lift the grenade launcher. 
ARCHIE GATES No. Let's get out of here. 
TROY It's about fucking time. 
Troy jumps into the luggage-packed truck, starts the engine. Vig starts the Humvee; Archie jumps in next to Vig. 
PAN TO the eight Shiites, plus the Man In Glasses and the Little Girl, jam into the crowded Humvee. Doc jumps in. 
The tank approaches. The Humvee pulls away. The tank rolls in from the side, but the tank turret WHINES and CLICKS, stuck in place. An Iraqi pops out the top of the tank. 
TANK IRAQI Hazal mafan. 
He gestures to the whining, stuck, turret. Another Iraqi tries pushing the turret. The truck with the small rocket launcher pulls up. 
INT./EXT. HUMVEE 
as it bounces along fast. Archie is in pain while Doc pours disinfectant over Archie's gunshot wound in his lower left arm, and wraps it. Vig looks terrified as he drives. 
INT. TRUCK 
Troy, driving alone, speeds the truck as fast as it will go, bouncing along the road. 
TROY We were home free, you stupid son of a bitch. 
WIDE AERIAL SHOT 
the truck is 60 yards behind the Humvee 
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.) What's the tank doing? 
POV 
through Doc's jiggling binoculars of the tank turning. 
DOC (O.S.) Lining us up -- 
BACK TO THE SCENE 
Vig pushes the Humvee's accelerator to the floor. 
The Shiite Man In Glasses and his Little Girl cling to the Humvee as they sit on top of the Vuitton hat cases with eight other Shiites, including TWO FIVE YEAR OLDS, A BOY AND GIRL. 
EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY 
Two Iraqi soldiers take a THIN ROCKET, four feet long, and load a clear plastic canister of brown fluid into it. A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT, a soldier is hit in the arm. 
WHIP PAN TO a Shiite boy with an old rifle in the third floor window of a small stone building. Iraqis shout and point at the sniper. The tank turns to the building. 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
The Humvee drives fast over the bumpy two-lane road. 
EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY 
The tank fires a round at the building which COLLAPSES. 
INT. SHIITE BUILDING - DAY 
A SHIITE MOTHER, FATHER, AND TWO CHILDREN pray at a crude table when the ceiling collapses. 
EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY 
The Iraqi soldiers fire the rocket launcher. 
DOC (O.S.) Incoming. 
EXT. DESERT -  DAY 
Vig turns the speeding Humvee off the road. Archie jerks the wheel back. 
ARCHIE GATES Stay on the road. 
VIG I don't wanna get hit. 
SLOW MOTION: Doc looks straight up with the binoculars. 
SLOW MOTION: a rocket streaks a squiggly white line of smoke across the sky. 
REAR OF HUMVEE, SLOW MOTION: half the Shiites hunch down, bracing for an explosion while the other half crane their necks, looking straight up into the sky. They cower when there is an EXPLOSION above. 
PAN UP TO - REGULAR SPEED: the ROCKET EXPLODES in the sky a hundred yards above the Humvee -- INTO A BROWN CLOUD. 
DOC Gas. 
Troy leans out the window of the moving truck and squints up at the brown gas cloud above as he drives fast. 
Archie and Doc grapple to put on their gas masks. Vig reaches around behind him for his mask as he drives. 
VIG Where's my mask? 
He accidentally veers off the road into the open desert. 
ZOOM IN TO a field of mines sitting right on top of the sand, 20 yards ahead. [Iraqi mines were often placed this way] 
ZOOM IN ON Archie's alarmed face

APRIL No, he called late last night. 
HOLLY (sadly) I, uh, I'm very surprised. 
APRIL (chuckling, gesturing) He wants to take me to see Rigoletto. 
HOLLY (looking briefly at April) And you, you-you're going? 
APRIL Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me. 
HOLLY (pausing) But I'm seeing him. 
APRIL (gesturing) I know.  I said that, but... (shrugging) he said it was something he really felt like doing. 
HOLLY (stopping and facing April) Gee, um... (looking off, sniffing) I...I don't know what to say. 
APRIL Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting? 
Holly looks away sadly; she shakes her head. 
APRIL (continuing) Huh? 
CUT TO: 
The big leap. 
The film cuts to Father Flynn's rectory office.  The Catholic priest looks out a simple stained-glass window, then turns to an offscreen Mickey. 
FATHER FLYNN (gesturing) Now why do you think that you would like to convert to Catholicism? 
The camera moves back to reveal Mickey, his back to the camera, sitting in front of Father Flynn's desk.  A lamp is lit in the background; the Father's desk is neat.  The room is comfortably decorated in wood and leather. 
MICKEY Well, uh, because, y-you know, I gotta have something to believe in, otherwise life is just meaningless. 
FATHER FLYNN (pacing behind his desk and gesturing) I understand.  But why did you make the decision to choose the Catholic faith? 
The movie cuts to Mickey's face.  He's very neat in a tie, sweater, and sports jacket. 
MICKEY (gesturing) Tch.  Well, y-you know...first of all, because it's a very beautiful religion.  It's very well structured. Now I'm talking now, incidentally, about the-the, uh, against-school- prayer, pro-abortion, anti-nuclear wing. 
FATHER FLYNN (offscreen) So at the moment you don't believe in God. 
The camera cuts back to Father Flynn, who walks over to a leather armchair next to a table set for tea.  He begins to pour the tea into china cups. 
MICKEY (offscreen) No.  A-a-and I-I want to.  You know, I'm-I'm willing to do anything. I'll, you know, I'll dye Easter eggs if it works. (walking over to Father Flynn and sitting down in an adjacent chair) I-I need some evidence.  I gotta have some proof.  Uh, you know, i- i-if I can't believe in God (gesturing, his raincoat in his lap) then I don't think life is worth living. 
FATHER FLYNN (stopping his tea pouring) It means making a very big leap. 
Father Flynn clasps his hands in his lap. 
MICKEY (nodding, fiddling with his raincoat) Yes, well, can-can you help me? 
The film abruptly cuts to the long hallway in Mickey's parents' apartment. 
In the foreground, a section of the living room can be seen, with a bureau holding a lamp and a framed photo.  The hallway itself is crowded with pictures and a wall shelf. At the other end of the hallway, in the background, is another bureau, with candlesticks on top and a framed picture on the wall above.  Mickey's mother stands in the front of this bureau at the hallway's end, screaming at the top of her lungs, holding her heart dramatically. 
MOTHER (crying) Why?  Oh, my God! 
She sobs hysterically, staggering offscreen to the bathroom; she shuts the door.  Mickey walks into view, in the living room, looking after his shocked mother, who continues to cry over the scene. 
MICKEY (overlapping and gesturing) I don't understand. (turning to his offscreen father) I thought that you would be happy. 
FATHER (offscreen) How can we be happy? 
His father walks into view, carrying a teacup and a candy dish.  He strides past Mickey towards the kitchen. 
MICKEY (following his father) Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought. 
FATHER (offscreen, in the kitchen) But Catholicism?  Why not your own people? 
MICKEY (gesturing at the kitchen door to his offscreen father) Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER (offscreen) You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ? 
MICKEY (gesturing) I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try. 
FATHER (offscreen) But why?  We raised you as a Jew. 
MICKEY (shrugging) So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision. 
Mickey's father walks into view; he stands by the stove near the kitchen doorway, picking up a dirty glass and some bowls to clean. 
FATHER But why Jesus Christ?  Why, for instance, shouldn't you become a Buddhist? 
Holding the dirty dishes in his hand, Mickey's father looks at his son. 
MICKEY (gesturing) A Bud--?  That's totally alien to me.  Look, you're getting on in years, right?  Aren't you afraid of dying? 
Mickey's father walks offscreen again, to the kitchen sink. 
FATHER (offscreen) Why should I be afraid? 
MICKEY (loudly gesturing) Oh! 'Cause you won't exist! 
FATHER (offscreen) So? 
MICKEY (gesturing) That thought doesn't terrify you? 
Mickey's father walks out of the kitchen, past his son, to the living room. 
FATHER (waving his arm) Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead. 
MICKEY (following his father, gesturing) I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened? 
FATHER (offscreen) Of what?  I'll be unconscious. 
MICKEY (turning and walking down the hallway) Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again! 
FATHER (offscreen) How do you know?

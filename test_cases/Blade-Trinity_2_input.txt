CRASH!  The three of them come FLYING DOWN in a spray of glass, landing atop one of the police cruisers below.  The roof buckles under their weight, windows SHATTERING -- 
CUMBERLAND Take him down! 
An FBI AGENT raises a CODA net gun atop his shoulder, taking aim.  BA-BANG!  Four projectiles expand out from the barrel, carrying a STEEL NET which has been strung between them. 
The netting hits Blade, wrapping around him, restricting his movements.  Immediately, a small army of agents DIVE on top of him, PUMMELING AWAY, trying to beat him into submission -- 
INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT 
On the verge of losing consciousness, Whistler props himself against a piece of machinery.  He's bleeding, been shot to hell.  One of his hands is closed, clutching something. 
Agents warily close in around him, guns raised. 
AGENT Move a finger and you're dead. 
WHISTLER (flipping them off) How 'bout this one? 
Whistler lets his other hand uncurl. He's got a REMOTE in his palm, with a tiny digital timer counting-down. 
AGENT #2 He's got something in his-- 
00:03.  00:02.  00:01.  The timer reaches zero. 
A SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS 
rock the workshop, knocking the agents back. 
EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT 
CLOUDS OF FIRE and FLAMING DEBRIS MUSHROOM OUTWARD, catching all unawares, sweeping them up off their feet with a hurricane force.  In the midst of the conflagration -- 
-- Blade briefly manages to tear free of his captors -- 
BLADE WHISTLER!!! 
-- but the wall of FIRE and LIGHT is rushing onward, sweeping up everything in its path, turning the world to white. 
INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 
FADE IN.  We are CLOSE ON Blade's perspiration-beaded face. His eyelids flutter as he slowly regains consciousness. 
CUMBERLAND (O.S.) Rise and shine, sleepyhead. 
PULL BACK.  We are in a room with a one-way mirrored window. Blade sits, hands cuffed behind him, BRIGHT LIGHTS shining down on him.  He looks disoriented, battered.  Very weak. 
Cumberland and Hale are sitting across from Blade. 
BLADE Who --? 
CUMBERLAND Special Agents Ray Cumberland and Wilson Hale, FBI.  We've been tracking you for a long time. 
BLADE Whistler -- 
HALE Dead.  Just like all of your victims. 
Blade shuts his eyes -- as if he could just wish them away. 
CUMBERLAND How many people have you killed?  Thirty? Forty?  A hundred? 
BLADE Those were familiars -- people who worked for them -- 
CUMBERLAND And by "them" you mean vampires, right? I suppose next you'll be telling us that Bigfoot's in on the conspiracy too? So what kills these bloodsu~kers, tough guy? Maybe you can give us some pointers. (counting on his ringers) You can stake 'em, right?  Then there's sunlight -- what about crosses, Wilson? Do those still work? 
HALE I don't know, Ray.  What if a vampire's Jewish? 
CUMBERLAND That's a good point.  And does garlic work on a Hindu vampire?  Or do you need saffron or something? 
Hale laughs.  Cumberland shakes his head, his smile fading. 
CUMBERLAND You can keep doing your song and dance as long as you want, Blade, but it's not going to play.  You're a stone-cold killer.  And you're sick as fuck. 
VANCE (O.S.) Let's leave the diagnosis to the professionals. 
ANGLE ON DR. EDGAR VANCE, 
standing in the doorway.  He's the man we saw on Larry King. He takes a seat by Blade, sets a leather case on a table. 
VANCE Hello, Blade.  My name is Doctor Vance. I'm with the Department of Mental Health. I've been charged with conducting a psychiatric evaluation of you. (to Cumberland and Hale) Gentleman, would you mind giving us a few moments alone? 
Cumberland nods.  They rise, exiting the room.  Vance smiles, trying to project a sympathetic air.

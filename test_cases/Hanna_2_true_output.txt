MILES Hey, again. 
SOPHIE Did you walk here? 
MILES She looks different. 
SOPHIE Do you want to hang with us? 
MILES Are you hungry? 
SOPHIE Miles is always hungry. 
HANNA I'm thirsty. 
94 EXT/INT. STRIP CLUB. HAMBURG. 94 
The Reeperbaln, the main street of Hamburg's red light district. Tough and unglamorous. MARISSA WIEGLER gets out of a taxi, checks the sign of the strip club and crosses the road. She is on the phone and we hear. 
LEWIS (O.S.) The Swedish borders are sealed. I have Swedish, Norwegian and Danish border patrols on high alert and Interpol have briefed the police. 
MARISSA I don't want any bad news Lewis. Neither of us can afford a fuck up. MARISSA hangs up. She enters a converted car park which is now a lap dancing bar. It's early in the day and the patrons are as scarce as the clothes on the dancers. At the far end of the room is the reason Marissa is there, MICHAEL ISAACS. Mid fifties. Rumpled suit, bleary, unshaven and drinking a scotch. ISAACS smiles coldly at MARISSA. 
ISAACS I didn't think they let women in here. 
MARISSA They let them in, they just don't let them get dressed. He smiles, drinks, she eyes the scotch. 
MARISSA (CONT'D) Still drinking on the job. You haven't changed. 
ISAACS You have. 
MARISSA Adapt or die. 
ISAACS You want a drink? 
MARISSA I'll wait until I really need one. He grins and drinks. She sits, with a sigh, looks him in the eye. 
MARISSA (CONT'D) Erik Heller's still alive. ISAACS glances up from his drink. 
ISAACS You don't say. 
MARISSA There's more. MARISSA passes him a newspaper. He opens it. Hidden inside is a picture of Hanna. He looks it over, surprised. 
ISAACS (IRONIC) Wow. All grown up. 
MARISSA He did a good job. 
ISAACS Did she turn out like you hoped? 
MARISSA She just tried to kill me. 
ISAACS Isn't it always the way? 
MARISSA The fuck does that mean? 
ISAACS You bring them into this world, teach them how to kill and maim... and then they turn against you. 
MARISSA I didn't teach her. 
ISAACS No, it's better than that. You bred her from a test tube. MARISSA turns to the BARMAN and signals for a round of the scotches, âTwo of these...â 
MARISSA Here's the problem: She thinks we killed her mother. He smiles wryly. 
ISAACS Just get her sectioned or something.

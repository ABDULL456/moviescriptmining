A beat. Then, as Daria reaches out and slips her hand into Odion's, smiling at him -- 
INT. SU'S T-BIRD - DAY Su and Archie. SU They have boxing matches in the day? ARCHIE Not exactly boxing. More dangerous. No gloves. No rules. Big money. Very illegal... Started holding 'em during the daytime to fool the cops. SU The man you remembered -- how do you know he will be here? ARCHIE I don't. But Chambers owns the operation, so I figure it's a good place to start. (then) This is it. They turn into... 
EXT. FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION A cavernous industrial building.   Cars parked on the perimeter. 
INT./EXT. SU'S T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION As they park -- 
SU How will you recognize him? ARCHIE I didn't see his face.   But I'll know his pinkie ring when I  see it. Ten carats. Round cut with   square mount. Good color and clarity.   I remember thinking what it would  do to my face if he hit me. OFF Su's dubious look, as Archie crams on a baseball hat to help disguise himself... 
INT. FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION Archie and Su exit the car and approach a GUARD manning a gate to the fight arena beyond. SU How do we get in? ARCHIE Leave that to me. Then, to the Guard -- ARCHIE Hey, man, how you doing? Got a fighter here I want to enter. Su shoots him a surprised look. ARCHIE My man's gonna put the rest of these bums to beddy-bye. He'll go in there and get all Chinese on 'em -- the teeth are gonna fly, the blood's gonna run... Gonna be fun. GUARD Whatever... You're number twelve, Bruce. He hands a card reading "12" to Su. As Archie and Su make their way toward the arena -- SU I didn't come here to fight. ARCHIE You won't have to. That was just to get us in. 
They reach the arena. It's also huge. Packed with men. Hazy with smoke. Loud with betting, cheers and boos. A large, chain-link cage stands at the center of the room. Inside, two battered and bloodied fighters are beating the shit out of each other. 
Like at    a Gallagher concert, front row fans have sheets of plastic    over their laps. Whenever a hard kick or punch lands,    the nearest fans quickly raise the plastic sheets to shield    themselves from flying blood. ARCHIE Good day, over a million dollars'll pass hands in here. 
SU Find the ring. ARCHIE Yeah.    Okay. He looks around.      Lotta African-American males. ARCHIE Could take a little while. As Archie starts moving through the crowd, looking at hands, and Su follows... 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY Daria and Odion enter, and Odion closes the door. He starts to take her in his arms. Daria slows him up. Guides him back toward a sofa. DARIA Sit down. Odion sits. DARIA Put on some music. Odion puts a DISC in the STEREO.        Cranks up some HIP-HOP. DARIA Nah.    Something slower. Odion SWITCHES MUSIC.        A SLOW TUNE fills the room. DARIA That's good... Now just relax... And watch...

Then, to no one in particular: \nJERRY He wants to be you so freaking bad. This kid has issues. At some point, you gotta trust somebody... \nBut Eazy's not paying attention.

Ron says it's the only way to protect everything I built. \nTomica looks to Ron, who nods. She stares off into space, slowly shaking her head.

He walks to the bed. Looks down at his friend, whom he hasn't seen in four years: Eazy's eyes are closed, a RESPIRATOR doing his breathing for him. \nNOTE: The BONE TAPE is still sitting, untouched, on the bedside table. Eazy never got a chance to listen to it. \nDre stands there, staring down, in this extended, surreal moment. He bends down, so his mouth is close to Eazy's ear. \nDRE (softly) Yo, Eazy. Wanna tell you somethin'. I know you can hear me. I know you're still in there -- \nWe PULL BACK, so WE CAN'T HEAR WHAT DRE IS SAYING. And we won't hear it, because that's between Dre & Eazy. \nAfter a few moments, Dre stands up straight. Whatever he had to say to Eazy, he's finished now.

He spots DRE walking out, looking glazed. Cube gets up. They stand there looking at each other. \nCUBE S'up Dre? \nDRE Good to see you, Cube. \nIt's been awhile. Lot of water under the bridge. They finally step to each other, and hug quickly, intensely. \nCUBE You see him? How he look? \nDRE He looks the same -- like Eric just sleeping. But he's in a coma. Got a machine breathing for him -- \nCube frowns, looks at the ground, pained. \nCUBE Can't see him like that, man. This is bad. I asked one of his homies to call me when he wakes up. \nDre nods, doesn't push it. He understands. As they exit together, they pass the Police Guards, in tight formation by the door, protecting the Hospital. Protecting Eazy. \n140   EXT. CEDARS - COURTYARD - LATER                            140 \nMORE PEOPLE keep arriving to the VIGIL. A steady flow. They all stare up at the Hospital, watching, waiting.

The PHONE RINGS on the bedside table. Cube stares at it -- \n142   EXT. DRE'S HOUSE - PORCH - DAY                             142 \nPhone to his ear, Dre listens a while, nods, face desolate. Seated beside him, Nicole rubs his back, consoling her man. \nDRE Okay. \nDre hangs up. Looks over to Nicole. \nDRE (CONT'D) He's gone. \nShe hugs him tight as we -- \n143   EXT.

From hazy, sun-blasted MORNING, to an explosively-hued SUNSET, into the electricity of NIGHT. \nWe hear EAZY'S VOICE, one last time, through some of the final words he released to his fans. \nThe TIDES on the beach rise and fall. Endless VEHICLES swarm the FREEWAYS like teeming blood vessels in veins. Clouds race across the sky like an avalanche, a river -- \n144   INT. DEATH ROW RECORDS - DAY                               144 \nDre strides down the lipstick red hallway, lined with platinum records, a determined look on his face. Enters -- \nTHE CONFERENCE ROOM \nTo find Suge, looking confused, sitting at the end of the long conference table. He's wearing another absurd Red-Devil suit, fedora, gold watch on a chain, flanked by a couple of jacked-up BLOODS.

You can't just up and go. \nDre does not avoid Suge's gaze. He looks right at him. \nDRE Gonna do my own thing now. Start fresh. Nobody to answer to but myself. It's time, Suge. \nSUGE You're one stupid muthafucka. You just gonna throw away all this money? `Cause if you leave, everything we created is mine. \nSuge starts to breathe hard through his nose.

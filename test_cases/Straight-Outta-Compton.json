{"train": "STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON \nWritten by \nJonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff \nStory by \nS. Leigh Savidge & Alan Wenkus and Andrea Berloff \n1   TITLE/CREDIT SEQUENCE:                                        1 \nAn AVALANCHE of SOUNDBITES, colliding and overlapping. Coming so fast, we can barely process them. A virtual sound book... \nWAR ON DRUGS. NANCY REAGAN. CRACK. DARYL GATES. CRIPS & BLOODS. Everything from KNIVES to PISTOLS to ASSAULT RIFLES. All these images add up to a minute and a half recap of not just black history but American history. As soon as they're done, we find ourselves plunged into -- \nTOTAL DARKNESS: \nFADE UP: ON; \n2   EXT. BROWN HOUSE - COMPTON - NIGHT                            2 \nA bucket pulls up in front of a shitty-looking BROWN HOUSE with ugly bars on the windows and doors. A rusted swing-set leans sideways on the dirt/grass they call a front lawn. \nSUPERIMPOSE: COMPTON, CA 1986 \nInside the car is ERIC WRIGHT, 21, but you know him as -- \nSUPERIMPOSE: ERIC WRIGHT AKA EAZY-E \nA man who is completely in his element -- comfortable and poised, ready for anything. \nHe hops out of the car, moves quickly to the TRUNK -- pops it open and reaches inside. With an electric screwdriver, Eazy unscrews a CERWIN-VEGA sub-woofer. Grabs a bulging BROWN BAG out of the speaker... and a 9mm -- SLAMS the trunk. \nON THE ROOF, a LOOKOUT clocks Eazy as he walks up to the front door of the decrepit house... \nEazy KNOCKS BY CODE. A dude, TONE (20s), opens a slat in the door. Gauges Eazy, EYES SKEPTICAL. \nTONE Who is it? \nEAZY Eric! Man, we been through this shit a thousand times. \nMultiple DEADBOLTS UNLOCK and an irritated Eazy enters -- \nEAZY (CONT'D) What's the use to having this dumb ass knock if I gotta tell you my name anyway? \n3   INT. BROWN HOUSE - MINUTES LATER                              3 \nIt's not what you'd call \"cozy.\" The carpet is torn up, stained, cigarette-burnt. Walls covered in TAGS. A PITBULL stares menacingly from the kitchen. \nIn addition to Eazy and Tone, there are THREE other people spread around the room: one GIRL lounges on a vinyl couch, eyes glazed; another girl, TASHA, loudly SCRAPES soul food onto the pitbull's plate; and a JITTERY DUDE steady keeps an EYE out the WINDOW, tense, occasionally clocking -- \nEAZY spreads the CONTENTS of the BROWN BAG before them on a long TABLE: three FREEZER BAGS each containing 10 ounces. He looks up, ALL BUSINESS. \nEAZY Now where the money at? \nTONE Man, you heard what happen? My best runner got cracked. They sent his young ass to Y.A. -- \nEAZY The fuck that got to do with me? \nTone turns to Tasha in the kitchen, nods. \nTONE Tasha, get this dude a 40. \nTASHA opens the fridge, grabs a 40oz. -- \nEAZY Do I look thirsty to you? (beat) Where my ends at? \n-- hands it to Tone who CRACKS it open. Drinks... \nTONE Why you so ruthless, Eric, damn! You don't want nothin' to drink? What you want -- (re: the girls) -- you want some pussy? \nEAZY Yep. But not from these strawberry bitches you got right here. \nTONE So you just gonna disrespect my house like that, Cuz? \nEAZY Dumb ass, this a dope house! It's already disrespected. \nJITTERY DUDE (re: Eazy's drugs) Well fuck it then -- You gonna have to let us hold on to that right there. \nON THE COUCH, the GIRL grabs a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN FROM UNDER A PILLOW. Levels it at Eazy, face grimaced, hard, strung out. \nEAZY Yeah, do what you gotta do -- `Cause I got my homies parked across the street from your momma's house. I don't show up. They show out... \nEazy just stares right back at them. The tension's like a pressure cooker about to burst. Until -- \nA WHISTLE echoes in from outside (THE LOOKOUT) -- \nSuddenly, everyone notices a deep RUMBLING coming from outside. Jittery Dude steps back from the window, eyes wide -- \nJITTERY DUDE Oh, shit -- \nBecause there's a MASSIVE ARMORED VEHICLE rolling down the street toward them. 6 TONS of steel, with a 14-foot BATTERING RAM mounted on the front. LAPD emblazoned on the side. \nJITTERY DUDE (CONT'D) Fuckin' Batter-Ram! \nEveryone in the room FLIES into action, STASHING the WEAPONS and the MONEY into hidden STASH SPOTS all over the HOUSE: Behind fake-panel LIGHT SWITCHES, hidden HATCHES beneath the FLOORBOARDS, in a fake-panel inside the FRIDGE. It's some serious MACGYVER SHIT. \nEazy grabs his ROCKS, BEE-LINES for the BACK of the HOUSE, eyes wide, amped on adrenaline as the RUMBLING ESCALATES to an almost UNBEARABLE LEVEL -- \nCRASH!!! The 14-foot BATTERING RAM PUNCHES THROUGH THE WALL. DEBRIS FLIES EVERYWHERE. The RAM keeps coming until -- \nThe GIRLS SCREAM! The ARMORED VEHICLE REVERSES, the BATTERING RAM POLE YANKING THE ENTIRE WALL OUT WITH IT, leaving a MASSIVE RAGGED HOLE where we can see -- \nTYREE Can I come with you? \nDRE You been fightin' for your own room this whole time and now you wanna come with me? \nThey share a CHUCKLE. Then -- \nTYREE You know she's just want the best for you. \nDRE I know, T. I want the best for me too -- that's way I gotta go. \nHim and Dre have special brother-to-brother embrace. Then Dre hops into his car. \nDRE (CONT'D) When I get set up right, I'mma have you come with me. Don't worry about it. It's gonna be sooner then you think. \nTyree sullenly nods. \nDre triggers the ignition, MUSIC BLASTING, and PEELS away -- \nDRE (CONT'D) Call you later. \n6   INT./EXT. DRE'S CAR - COMPTON - MINUTES LATER                    6 \nDre rolls along   in that ugly-ass Datsun. It's still early, but the STREETS   are starting to FILL UP. Dudes in doorways, on the corners,   clocking him as he passes. An LA SHERIFF'S DEPT. SQUAD CAR   slides past, disappears around a corner. \nWE HEAR a HELICOPTER SOUND, as WE GO WIDE -- \n7   EXT. LOS ANGELES - WAY UP IN THE SKY - DAY                       7 \nFlying high over the city, it's quiet up here, only the sound of WIND. BELOW, we see the tight grids of SOUTH LOS ANGELES, and the densely-packed TRAFFIC heading north along the 110 FREEWAY, as it angles toward the SKYSCRAPERS of DOWNTOWN L.A. \nWe move NORTH and there's DODGER STADIUM plunked at the southern tip of ELYSIAN PARK, and the LA RIVER twisting snakelike up into GRIFFITH PARK -- \nAnd NORTHWEST past the mountains of Griffith, descending into the VALLEY, where we suddenly DIVE DOWN into WOODLAND HILLS and settle upon the low-slung sprawl of -- \n8   INT./EXT. YELLOW BUS - TAFT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY                    8 \nWe track backward through a school bus full of STUDENTS. Almost exclusively black and Latino kids. Late 80's fashions. All the way in the BACK ROW we settle on O'SHEA JACKSON, who we now know as -- \nSUPERIMPOSE: O'SHEA JACKSON AKA ICE CUBE \nRaiders cap pulled low over a shoulder-length Jheri curl. Hunched over, wearing a soon-to-be-iconic FROWN of concentration, he SCRIBBLES LYRICS into a NOTEBOOK: \n\"BORED AS HELL AND I WANNA GET ILL. SO I WENT TO THE SPOT WHERE MY HOMEBOYS CHILL --\" \nThe ROAR of a powerful sports car snaps Cube's concentration. He gazes out the school bus window to see that -- \nIn stark contrast to those on the bus, just beyond the glass is a sea of WHITE STUDENTS. They hang out, shoot the shit in their nice clothes, hop into their nice cars. It's a club that Cube isn't a part of and it's clear that he can feel it. \nHe frowns, looks back down at his notebook as the bus pulls away from Taft High... \n9     INT./EXT. YELLOW BUS - LATER                                  9 \nThe BUS cruises Southbound on Crenshaw. And compared to the Valley, it looks like BEIRUT out there: Graffiti tags, liquor stores everywhere, boarded-up shops, DUDES loitering, drinking, slanging. Crip throws a rock and hits the bus. \nFIND CUBE sitting halfway back, still doing his thing, writing rhymes, minding his own. \nNEAR HIM, a few KIDS goof around, flash GANG SIGNS out the window at the passing CARS, PEDESTRIANS, not noticing -- \nA10   INT./EXT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS                             A10 \nPulling out of a side street onto Crenshaw, we see two hard- looking O.G. BLOODS. As the bus passes, they CLOCK THE KIDS flashing SIGNS. They can't believe it. Driver Grits his teeth. SPEEDS OUT after the bus -- \n10    INT./EXT. YELLOW BUS - MOMENTS LATER                         10 \nThe bus rolls to a stop. Before any KIDS can get off -- the O.G. Bloods' truck pulls in front of the bus, blocking the road. Passenger hops out. \nNoticing, the BUS DRIVER goes to shut the doors, but he's too late -- O.G. Blood gets on, strides past the BUS DRIVER -- glock 9mm in hand. \nBUS DRIVER Hey what's going on? -- \nO.G. BLOOD Shut the fuck up, Blood! (Addresses the whole bus) You young muthafuckas wanna die today?! \nEveryone on the bus falls SILENT. By the shocked expression on the kids' faces, they have no clue how or if they're gonna get out of this alive. \nO.G. BLOOD (CONT'D) HUH!? \nHe makes his way back to the WANNABE KIDS near the expressionless Cube. Sensing shit is about to jump off, Cube slowly reaches for the WINDOW next to him, starts SLIDING IT OPEN. He edges closer to the window, grabs his NOTEBOOK, fully prepared to jump the fuck out that window. \nO.G. BLOOD (CONT'D) You little Crab ass niggas could've got this whole bus shot the fuck up! We saw that bullshit you was throwing up out the window! Hit me up now! \nWANNABE KID 1 Didn't mean nothin' by it -- just playing around. \nO.G. BLOOD That's yo muthafuckin problem, Blood! This shit ain't nuthin' ta play wit! It's real in the field, nigga! Shit's life and death! I kill Crips for breakfast, Blood! So keep yo' mothafuckin hand down when you see me, Understand?! \nWANNABE KID 1 Yes. \nThe O.G. Blood looks over his shoulder, scowls at all the terrified faces staring back at him. \nO.G. BLOOD What you little muthafuckas need to do is start gangbang them got damn books! Learn some shit better then what we doing! If not, I might be the one that kill yo' dumb ass! Remember me! This that Crenshaw Mafia, Blood! \nAnd with that, the O.G. Blood tucks his gun, and calmly exits the bus -- leaving behind the stunned kids. \nTheir truck pulls away into traffic. \nCube grab his books, get up to exit the bus along with a few others, but not before glancing over at the kids, who sit there sweating, shell-shocked. \nCube shakes his head at the wannabes. No way he's going out like that. \n11   EXT. SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY                                    11 \nCube walks along the streets, Pee Chee folder and notebooks in hand, books under his arm as -- \nWe're given tour of the sights and sounds of South Central. The pervasive shudder of LAPD CHOPPERS TAUNT OVERHEAD, DOGS BARKING, as an LAPD SQUAD CAR CRUISES MENACINGLY PAST like a shark in festive waters. \nWHAM! Crash Cop 2 SLAMS Block Dude 1. Forces him to interlock his fingers behind his head -- \nCUBE Officer, can you please explain why you jackin' us? \nCRASH COP 2 We don't have to explain shit! \nBlock Dude 1 HOWLS in pain as Crash Cop 2 viciously SQUEEZES his interlocked knuckles. Crash Cop 1 shoots a look to Uniform Cop 2: Settle down, dude! \nTWO MORE SQUAD CARS SCREECH onto the scene. Four UNIFORMED POLICE climb out, to make an even bigger deal out of nothing. \nCube's Dad, HOSIE, appears up on the porch, pissed. \nHOSIE JACKSON Hey! What the hell's goin' on out here? Those boys all live on this block! \nThe Cops ignore him as Cube's mother, DORIS, appears beside Hosie, shocked to see her son getting assaulted -- \nDORIS JACKSON (re: Cube) Officer, that's my son! \nUNIFORM COP 2 Get back inside, ma'am! \nBut she starts coming down the steps toward the Cop -- He UNSNAPS his holster, hand grasping his pistol. \nDORIS JACKSON I just wanna know what's going on -- \nThe COP jams a FINGER inches away from Doris' face! \nUNIFORM COP 2 Get the FUCK BACK INSIDE, Lady, or I promise I will ruin your night! \nDoris' mouth drops open. The disrespect is incredible. \nICE CUBE You ain't gotta talk to my moms like that, man! \nUniform Cop 1 leans down, WHISPERS to Cube -- \nUNIFORM COP 1 You think we give a fuck? This LAPD, boy! Crash Unit! We the only gangstas around here! \nWIDE SHOT: Cube, his parents, and the Block Dudes helpless, held hostage in their own neighborhood. After every pocket is turned out, body patted down and rights violated -- \nUNIFORM COP 2 All right, they check out. We got cards on all of `em already. (to Cube and Co.) Stay out of trouble. \nThe cops pile back into their cars leaving behind the stunned neighborhood. Cube grabs his NOTEBOOKS, cleans them off as -- \nA CHOPPER ABOVE DEAFENS ALL SOUND in a PRIMORDIAL ROAR. \n14    OMITTED                                                     14 \nA15   INT. DOO-TO'S CLUB - ENTRYWAY - MOMENTS LATER               A15 Muffled MUSIC seeps into the area as SECURITY GUARDS thoroughly SEARCH everyone. One of them stares Eazy down. \nSECURITY GUARD You really wanna be here? This club is full of Pirus. \nREN We straight. \nEazy LAUGHS, doesn't give a fuck. \nEAZY Thanks for the tip, homie. \nThe Security Guard frowns as he allows them into -- \n15   THE MAIN FLOOR                                               15 \nMUSIC PUMPING, we FOLLOW EAZY and REN into the CLUB, which is PACKED, people partying their asses off. Everyone's here: REGULAR FOLKS, BLOODS, SKINNY GIRLS, BIG GIRLS, DEALERS, ATHLETES. A true hood cross-section. \nAS WE MOVE through the place, we see CUBE, JINX and TYREE standing near the wall: JINX and TYREE are busy clocking the GIRLS, but CUBE is studying a ripped-out page of LYRICS. \nON STAGE, wearing purple satin jackets with WORLD CLASS WRECKIN CRU on the back, DRE spins some `80s R&B while his boy, YELLA, leans down, hollers at a GIRL in the crowd. \nDre spots someone moving through the mass of people -- \nDRE Yo, Yella, man -- Lonzo comin'! \nYella quickly moves to the record crate, starts sifting through them to look like he's busy as -- \nLONZO WILLIAMS, club PROMOTER and Dre's BOSS approaches. He leans over to Dre: \nLONZO Gonna make sure nothin's poppin' off outside. Keep them fat asses shakin'. None of that rap bullshit, you hear? I want people thinkin' `bout pussy not pistols. (then) And Yella, I saw you talkin to my lady. Keep your fuckin hands to yourself. \nLonzo shoots Yella a look, then disappears from the stage. \nDRE Why you fuckin with that nigga's girl, man? \nYELLA Why not? \nDre chuckles, immediately searches the crowd, locking eyes with CUBE. Dre gives him a NOD, and Cube takes a breath, heads toward the Stage -- Moment of truth. \nIN THE BACK, EAZY and REN are surrounded by ladies. But Eazy's attention is clearly -- \nON STAGE. Cube appears next to Dre, who's cuing up a new record. He stops the music, grabs the mic: \nDRE Compton! I got my homie -- he's about to get his rhyme on for y'all! Give it up for Ice muthafuckin' Cube! \nDre hands the mic to Cube as the crowd eyeballs him with suspicion and restraint. They're clearly not gonna give him respect til he earns it. Cube steels himself, clenches his jaw, puffs out his chest. And time turns eternal before -- \nDRE drops the needle on Steve Arrington's funked-out WEAK AT THE KNEES (hardcore NWA fans will recognize this track as the original sample for GANGSTA GANGSTA). \nCube starts rapping, his voice powerful, thick with attitude: \nICE CUBE Here's a little somethin' about a nigga like me. Never shoulda been let out the penitentiary. Ice Cube would like to say, That I'm a crazy muthafucka from around the way. Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out, Now I'm the muthafucka that ya read about. Takin a life or two, that's what the hell I do. Don't like how I'm livin', well fuck you! \nAfter only a few lines, the crowd's CHEERING. HOLLERING. Dancing. An infectious vibe. \nAnd we DRIFT back to Eazy, standing with Ren, feeling the fuck out of this music, pensive look on his face. Something crystallizing as we -- \n16   INT. DOO-TO'S CLUB - LATER                                   16 \nBut Dre just stands his ground, head cocked to the side, defying the Officer. In a flash -- \nBAM! Dre finds his face planted into the hood of the squad car! Cuffs slapped on! Same for Tyree and the Dude as we -- \n18   EXT. COMPTON POLICE STATION - EARLY MORNING                  18 \nDRE emerges from the Police Station, police property bag in hand, to find EAZY waiting for him beside a fresh `63 IMPALA LOWRIDER. \nEAZY They got you for carrying records? That's some gangsta shit, Dre. \nDre smiles, chuckles -- He's clearly beyond exhausted. \nDRE Cops will throw a nigga in jail for anything. \nAt Eazy's car, Dre and Eazy pound hug. \nEAZY Lonzo just left you here, huh? \nDRE Guess he's sick of bailing my ass out. \nDre kneels down on the pavement, takes his shoelaces from the police property bag and casually starts lacing his sneakers. But Eazy clocks a couple POLICE OFFICERS eyeballing him and Dre. Clearly, he's not comfortable here. Hops into the car. \nEAZY Mind gettin' your funny lookin' ass in the car before they arrest you for some other dumb shit? \nEazy gestures like, we in front of the police station! Dre realizes. My bad. Hops in. Keeps lacing his sneakers... \nEAZY (CONT'D) Man, I was thinkin' about what you said last night. \nDRE Yeah, and..? \nEAZY It's interestin' -- \nDRE Interestin'? Tell me this, how long you think that shit you doin' gonna last, huh? You ever heard of a happy ending in that game? \nEAZY Shit, man, this all comin' from the nigga I just bailed out. \nDRE Listen, if you can slang dope, you can slang records. You got a mind for this shit, E. \nEAZY Okay so what then -- That nigga last night? Is that what we doin'? \nDRE What, Cube? Nah, he in a group right now, got some other business goin' on. But I got this group called H.B.O. from the east coast. Dope voices, and Cube wrote a song for `em that's crazy. \nEazy considers for a long moment as we -- \n19   INT. LONZO'S STUDIO - DAY                                    19 \nDre sits in front of a huge MIXING BOARD, adjusting the levels on a hard-driving BEAT. \nA small CREW of Kangol-wearing RAPPERS (HOME BOYS ONLY, aka HBO) are gathered around, reading pages we recognize as CUBE'S LYRICS with befuddled expressions. \nHBO 1 What the fuck is \"Gankin\"? And what's a \"6-4\"? \nCUBE (O.S.) It's a car. A `64 Impala. \nEveryone turns to look at CUBE, off to the side, annoyed. \nCUBE (CONT'D) Gankin's when somebody jacks you. Ain't a big deal. Just sounds better that way. \nAnother HBO dude chimes in -- \nHBO 2 I dunno, too much cussin' to get radio play. And honestly, nobody gives a fuck about Compton -- \nDre interrupts from the board, no back down in him. \nDRE Y'all got somethin' to say about Compton? Cause we might have a problem up in this bitch. \nNobody says a thing. Deafening silence. Then: \nDRE (CONT'D) Then do the lyrics. We losin' time and I'm losin' patience. \nThe vibe is tense, unpleasant. Finally: \nHBO 1 This ain't us. I ain't fuckin' with this Jheri curl bullshit -- \nCUBE Fuck you then. Wearing a Kangol don't make you L.L. Cool J nigga, remember that. \nHBO 1 CRUMPLES the Lyrics sheet into a ball. \nHBO 2 Yeah. Now what? \nCUBE What you wanna do, mark ass nigga? \nCube and the HBO dudes square up, swelling and huffing -- Without hesitation, Eazy gets up, stands beside Cube. Dre whips off his headphones and flanks Cube from the other side. These dudes have each other's back, ready to throw down. \nThe HBO clowns start exiting, talking shit. \nEazy wanders back over to the couch, plops down, sighs: \nEAZY Well there goes the talent. Don't know a whole lot about the music game, but we can't start a label without talent. \nThe three of them chuckle. Eazy sighs, shakes his head. \nEAZY (CONT'D) Okay, I put up my money -- I held up my side of the deal, Dre. When you gonna deliver your side? \nDRE Well shit, why don't you get on the mic and try it? \nEAZY What? Fool, I ain't no rapper. \nOff Eazy's unsure look -- \nDRE You already spent the money. Don't you get it? Man, this song is all about you! This song is about Eazy-muthafuckin'-E! Now get in the booth. Let me deliver my side of this shit. \n20   INT. LONZO'S STUDIO - LATER                                 20 \nLaughter as Dre cues it up, the SONG RESUMING, as we -- \n22   INT. MACOLA RECORDS - LOS ANGELES - DAY                     22 \nBOYZ IN THA HOOD is PLAYING OVER -- \nA STACK of VINYL RECORDS moves through a PRESS. A machine STAMPS a RED LABEL onto the MIDDLE. CLOSE ON the RED RUTHLESS LABEL -- BOYZ N THA HOOD. \nIN THE RECEIVING AREA, EAZY picks up a couple BOXES of RECORDS. He PAYS for them, and hauls them away. \n23   INT. RECORD STORE - CENTRAL AVE - COMPTON - DAY             23 \nBOYZ keeps on THUMPING -- \nDRE and TYREE stand at the counter of a RECORD STORE, with a BOX OF RECORDS. The CLERK takes about SIX RECORDS -- \n24   EXT. RUN-DOWN HOUSE - COMPTON - DAY                         24 \nBOYZ continues OVER -- \nEazy emerges from a RUN-DOWN HOUSE, jogs across the street to his BUCKET, climbs inside, opens his STASH SPOT, stuffs a large WAD of CASH inside. A hustler is always hustlin -- \n25   EXT. BACK YARD HOUSE PARTY - SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY            25 \nSome local TEENAGERS are partying, drinking and listening to BOYZ N THE HOOD wax. And that shit has the party bumpin'. \nA sense that this song is going VIRAL, in a contagious, pre- internet sort of way -- \n26   EXT. ROADIUM SWAP MEET - LOS ANGELES - DAY                  26 \nBOYZ continues as Eazy brings TWO BOXES of RECORDS to a SWAP MEET BOOTH operated by STEVE YANO. Yano excitedly collects the two boxes, hands over some cash. Deal done. Before Eazy can even bounce, some KIDS bumrush Yano for copies -- \n27   INT. K-DAY RADIO STATION - LOS ANGELES - DAY                27 \nBOYZ slowly fades, iconic KDAY Disc Jockey GREG MACK spinning the TRACK over the airwaves of Los Angeles. He grins, bobbing his head, digging this shit for real. \nGREG MACK 1580 KDAY, this is Greg Mack -- Mack Attack. That was \"Boyz n tha Hood\" by Eazy-E, local rapper out of Compton. Sounds like he's about 15 years old -- \nHe glances over to the TELEPHONE SWITCHBOARD, which suddenly LIGHTS UP like crazy, with dozens of CALLERS. \nGREG MACK (CONT'D) -- I know you like it. It's been the most requested record on this station ever since I played it. The freshest song of 1986 -- \n28   INT. MACOLA RECORDS - RECEIVING AREA - DAY                28 \nEazy pays for another couple boxes of records. Grabs them -- \nJERRY HELLER (O.S.) I heard your record. \nEazy turns to find -- \nJERRY HELLER, a middle-aged guy in a velvet track suit. His face is craggy, seasoned, wise. He's got terrible posture, but lively, hyper-alert eyes. He extends his hand to Eazy. \nJERRY Jerry Heller. \nEAZY Eric Wright. \nJERRY Pleasure to meet you. Would it be possible to have a word with you, Eric? \nEAZY About what? \n29   INT. MACOLA RECORDS - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER              29 \nJerry at his desk, Eazy on the ratty couch. Eazy lets his eyes wander around the shabby office. The sad furniture, the old and irrelevant posters on the walls. \nJERRY I thought your record was good. \nEAZY Just good? Why you call me in here then -- \nEazy gets up and heads for the door -- \nJERRY No-no-no, hang on. (beat) I thought it was exceptional. Please, sit back down. \nEazy indulges Jerry. Sits back down and stares, cold, unreadable. Jerry rubs his eyes, frustrated, his regular spiel isn't having its usual effect. \nJERRY (CONT'D) Let's try this again. As a music manager, let me tell you what I can do for you, Eric -- \nEAZY Maybe I'm the one who can do somethin' for you. \nJERRY You think because I don't have some flashy office, that means I don't know what I'm talking about? Elton John, War, Styx, REO Speedwagon -- \nEAZY You manage anybody this decade? \nJerry leans on his elbows on the desk, cocks his head at Eazy. The balls on this kid. \nJERRY Let me tell you what I see. Lotta raw talent. Lotta braggadoccio. But if you think anyone's gonna talk to you, if you think anyone's gonna let you into the building where you might talk to somebody -- somebody who matters -- you're crazy. \nEazy frowns, looks away -- \nJERRY (CONT'D) That's what I do for you. I will make you legit. I will take you into that building. I will protect you. I will block out all the noise of this business and we can build something big. (MORE) \nJERRY (CONT'D) But you're gonna have to believe in me like I believe in you. If you don't think you can do that... \nEazy doesn't budge. Satisfied, Jerry continues -- \nJERRY (CONT'D) You got more music for me? \nEAZY I got everything you need. \nJERRY Good, cause you're gonna have to follow this up. So what does N.W.A. stand for anyway? (with a smile) No Whites Allowed? \nEazy looks at Jerry. Cold as ice. \nEAZY \"Niggas With Attitudes.\" \nTHE CROWD DOPE MAN PLEASE CAN I HAVE ANOTHER HIT??? \nCUBE The Dopeman said Cluck I don't give a shit, if your girl kneels down -- \nTHE CROWD AND SUCKS MY DICK!!! \nwith each other, like, Oh my God, this is sick! \nIN THE CROWD, we find JERRY and the RECORD EXECS. One of the EXECS looks disgusted, WALKS OUT. Jerry watches him go... \nJERRY So what do ya think? \nRECORD EXEC Jerry, we're friends, but Compton? (laughs) I don't think so. Queens..? Maybe. But. If you find another Bon Jovi, you call me. \nThe Exec brushes past Jerry and WALKS OUT. Jerry turns and sees that BRYAN TURNER is the only Exec still there. And he's WATCHING with wide eyes, overwhelmed while -- \nUP ON STAGE, EAZY tears into his verse -- \nEAZY Yeah high-rollin', big money I'm foldin, Bitch on my tip for the dick I'm holdin'. Strung strawberry, jockin' me so early. Ho you want a hit -- \nCROWD YOU GOTTA GET YOUR KNEES DIRTY!!! \nIN THE BACK OF THE CLUB, from a corner, a big man is watching, mind going, This is SUGE KNIGHT. \n33   INT. SKATELAND RINK - LATER                                33 \nThe last raucous PARTY-GOERS exit, leaving behind some CLEANING CREW and OUR GUYS, still riding the high of performing. \nDOC Damn Dre, ya'll wrecked these mothafuckas tonight! \nDRE I know. Stage was shaking so much-- thought my needles was about to jump off the record! \nCUBE I'm still trippin' that they knew all the words! That's Crazy... \nREN Compton is definitely on the map my nigga! \nYELLA Did you see all the freaks that was out there? Lord, thank God for biker shorts! \nEverybody shoots YELLA a look. \nCUBE We talkin' about the power of N.W.A. and all you saw tonight was pussy? \nYELLA Man, pussy is power. \nThey chuckle at Yella in disbelief as SUGE KNIGHT approaches. \nSUGE (surprisingly friendly) Man, I had a feelin' y'all was gonna represent tonight. Good shit. \nEAZY Wuddup, Suge -- What you been up to, homie? Still out in Vegas? \nSUGE Back and forth. Doing some bodyguard work among other things. If ya'll need my services, just let me know. \nEAZY Aight. But we don't need no body guards. \nSUGE You never know what you need until you need it. \nSomewhat of an uncomfortable pause of dead air. \nJERRY rounds the corner, sweating through his misshapen suit, along with BRYAN TURNER. \nSUGE (CONT'D) I just came back here to give ya'll your props. I got my people out here waiting on me. But I'll be around. \nSuge exits... as DOC clocks his flavor-- our attend goes to Jerry and Bryan. \nJERRY That was quite a show, gentlemen. Nice job. Very, very nice. \nThey all keep STARING at him, waiting. Jerry grins, enjoying stretching out this moment. \nJERRY (CONT'D) This is Eazy E and NWA. Guys, this is Bryan Turner. \nCUBE (brazenly) Ice Cube, `Sup? \nJERRY Uh, Bryan runs Priority Records. He wants to sign you. \nBRYAN TURNER Immediately. Fellas, I loved the show. You really had the crowd on their feet. I think you'll fit perfectly with our label. \nDRE That'll work. Priority Records? I'm not familiar with your label. What artist do you got over there? \nBryan looks at Jerry, who folds his arms, chin on his chest. \nBRYAN TURNER Nothing big. Just an R&B group. \nREN Who dat? \nBryan hesitates, almost ashamed to say -- \nBRYAN TURNER Uh-- The California Raisins. \nEveryone in NWA grimaces -- \nCUBE Them little-ass raisins on the commercial? Singin', \"I Heard it Through the Grapevine\"? \nYep. They all LAUGH in Bryan's face. He smiles too. \nBRYAN TURNER Laugh all you want. Those little fuckers went gold last year. \nThe laughing stops -- This gets their attention and respect. \nEAZY Gold? \nJERRY Yep, almost platinum. Bryan has a great distribution platform. \nThis is the perfect time for Jerry Heller to seal the deal. \nThe TORRANCE P.D. CRUISER pulls up fast, two COPS popping out. One black the other white. Weapons drawn. \nTORRANCE COP 1 (BLACK) Everybody down on the ground now! \nThe guys are confused. Food in hand. \nREN What we do?! \nThese cops aren't playing and they don't want to be questioned. \nTORRANCE COP 2 (WHITE) (Shoving Ren to the ground) Get your fuckin ass on the ground before I shoot you! That's what you did! \nAfter peeping out the cops overly aggressive posture. The guys start to comply. Mexican food hits the ground first then all the guys go face down-- spread eagle. \nDRE Why you got on the ground like this, officer? \nTORRANCE COP 1 For our protection. It's 6 of you, only two of us. So just sit there and shut up. (to his partner) Call for back up. \nTorrance Cop 2 starts to call it in. \nTorrance Cop 1 starts to roughly frisk the guys. \nTORRANCE COP 1 (CONT'D) This is Torrance. You niggas supposed to be somewhere? \nEAZY Yeah. Here. We workin'. \nTORRANCE COP 1 Working? Yeah, I bet. \nDRE What we do? \nTORRANCE COP 2 We'll find out what you did in a minute. \nWithin seconds, the Cop has Dre legs spread, frisking him roughly, hyper-extending his arms -- \nDRE What the fuck -- \nTORRANCE COP 1 Shut your hole! \nThe whole group is getting frisked one by one. Until Jerry Heller comes to the rescue. \nJERRY Excuse me officer, what's going on out here?! \nTORRANCE COP 1 Step back sir! Just making sure these thugs are clean! \nJerry keeps coming. \nJERRY These are not thugs, they're artists! \nAs Jerry gets into the officers face, we see the contrast of the black guys face down on the ground with the Cops and Jerry's shoes standing over them talking. \nTORRANCE COP 1 Artists? What kind of artists? \nJERRY They're rappers working in the studio right here. \nTORRANCE COP 2 Rappers? Rap is not art. It's jungle music. And who are you supposed to be? \nJERRY I'm the manager. \nTORRANCE COP 1 Well you're wasting your time, Mr. Manager, `cause your rappers look like typical gang bangers to me. \nAs the insults continue-- We LINGER ON CUBE, consuming his incendiary eyes, his flared nostrils. He's just about had enough of this shit. \nTORRANCE COP 2 Why don't you spend your time managing real music like Lynyrd Skynyrd! \nTORRANCE COP 1 Or Con-Funk-Shun! Real instruments. Real music! Not this bullshit rap! \nTORRANCE COP 2 Fuckin' fad. \nTORRANCE COP 1 (laughing) Tell me about it. \n37   INT. AUDIO ACHIEVEMENTS STUDIO - EMPTY OFFICE - LATER        37 \nDimly lit, Cube sits hunkered over a desk, writing furiously in his notebook. As if he's possessed. He slaps a page aside, scribbling on the back. WE CATCH GLIMPSES of ICONIC WORDS ON THE PAGE -- \nGOT IT BAD CAUSE I'M BROWN .... SEARCHIN' MY CAR, LOOKIN' FOR THE PRODUCT .... THINKIN' EVERY NIGGA IS SELLIN' NARCOTICS. \n38   INT. AUDIO ACHIEVEMENTS STUDIO - CONTINUOUS                  38 \nDre is at the mixing board working on the instruental track for FUCK THA POLICE. The instrumental is playing without any lyrics or the hook on it. \nCUBE (O.S.) Yo! \nCUBE enters the studio -- Hands the open notebook over to Eazy, who scans it, hands it over to Dre for a look. \nEAZY (sly smile) This gonna start some shit, Cube. \nCUBE (a grunt) Yeah, fuck the police. \nDre smiles as we cut to -- \nDre is scratching in the iconic hook. FUCK THA POLICE-- FUCK, FUCK, FUCK THA POLICE. He continues to scratch... \n38pt2   Ice Cube on the mic spitting the venomous lyrics of Fuck Tha 38pt2 Police. \n40      EXT.

ARENA - STAGE                                     46pt5 \n-- Cube destroys GANGSTA, GANGSTA, nostrils flared, giving it his all. As the CHORUS KICKS IN -- \nCUBE Indianapolis in the muthafuckin' house! \n47pt1   INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                47pt1 \nMuffled MUSIC, LAUGHTER THUMPS through the WALLS as we find DRE sitting on a bed in an empty hotel room, talking to -- \nDRE (INTO PHONE) I can't do it, T. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n47pt2   EXT. VERNA'S HOUSE - PORCH - CONTINUOUS                47pt2 \nTYREE, who's chillin' in a chair, surveying the street, all smiles talking to his cool-ass big brother. \nTYREE (INTO PHONE) Come on. I could meet up with y'all in Dallas or -- Yo, you gotta let me come fuck with you in Miami! \nDre laughs. Misses his baby brother. \nDRE (INTO PHONE) Oh, you wanna partake in some of those fat asses, huh. \nTYREE (INTO PHONE) You know it! \nDRE (INTO PHONE) So what you think moms will say about you comin' on tour? \nTyree's silence is telling. \nDRE (INTO PHONE)(CONT'D) Exactly. `Cause you got school and you know she won't let you miss that many days. \nTYREE (INTO PHONE) You did. \nDRE (INTO PHONE) Exactly my point. \nTYREE (INTO PHONE) So I'm paying for your shit? \nDRE (INTO PHONE) How it is, T. Youngest always do. \nTyree deflates... \nDRE (INTO PHONE) (CONT'D) How moms doin'? Is she there? \nTYREE (INTO PHONE) She good, but nah, you know her, constantly workin'. \nDRE (INTO PHONE) Well make sure you take care of her, aiight? I'll tell you what, you stay your ass outta trouble and I'll call you when I'm on the way to Miami-- we'll see about getting you on a flight. \nTYREE (INTO PHONE) (perks up) Aiight, man... You promise, Dre! \nDRE (INTO PHONE) I got you. Just bring a lot of rubbers. \nDre and Tyree have a nice laugh together. \nSuddenly there's a BANGING at Dre's FRONT DOOR -- \nDRE (INTO PHONE) (CONT'D) Hold on a second, somebody at the -- \nCLICK. TYREE'S GONE. Dre sets the phone down. Walks to the door. OPENS it to find -- \nA BIG DUDE, standing outside, looking PISSED! \nBIG DUDE Yeah nigga, I'm looking for my girl Felicia. Heard she was up here in one of these rooms. \nDRE No Felicia in here, man. \nDre starts closing the door, and the DUDE jams his BOOT in, stopping Dre from closing the door. \nBIG DUDE Mind if I take a look? \nDRE Get your foot out my door -- \nBig Dude pulls up his SHIRT, PISTOL poking out of his waistband -- Dre SHOVES him back and SLAMS the door! Quickly OPENS the DOOR to the adjacent room where -- \n47pt3   ON THE OTHER SIDE                                      47pt3 \nThere's a PARTY going on. EAZY, CUBE and REN are all partying with GIRLS, most of whom aren't wearing any shirts. Titties are everywhere, booze flowing freely. \nYELLA's in the middle, FUCKING A GIRL on one of the beds. \nDRE Yo! Any of y'all named Felicia? \nAll the GIRLS shake their heads. \nYELLA (to the girl under him) Hey baby. You Felicia? \nGIRL You forgot my name, muthafucka? \nShe looks pissed, but they keep on fucking anyway. \nDRE I think her man's outside. And that nigga strapped. \nEyes wide, Eazy quickly pulls the GUN DUFFEL out from under one of the beds, unzips it, fishes through and pulls out an AK. \nYELLA Whoa! Eazy, you can't be blastin inside the hotel -- \nCube raises his hand in the air, quickly SNAPS HIS MIDDLE FINGER to attention. Ren does the same with BOTH HANDS -- \nThe CROWD RESPONDS by getting LOUDER THAN WE'VE EVER HEARD, and RETURNING the gesture. \nWe're talking THOUSANDS of people, all with BOTH MIDDLE FINGERS RAISED -- this is the real shit, this is what they came here for -- \nCUBE (CONT'D) This NWA -- We do what the fuck we wanna do! We say what the fuck we wanna say! So, all I wanna tell that cop talking shit back stage is -- Yo Dre, I got something to say! \nDre DROPS IT. Cube jumps right into it, pure adrenaline -- \nCUBE (CONT'D) FUCK THE POLICE COMIN' STRAIGHT FROM THE UNDERGROUND. A YOUNG NIGGA GOT IT BAD CAUSE I'M BROWN -- \nThe crowd goes ape-shit! BOUNCING and THRASHING like a MOSH PIT. Pure ELECTRICITY-- \nJerry Heller is suddenly alarmed by the song selection. \nAs Cube slices throughout the first verse -- \nCops are getting agitated -- Waiting for the order to pounce. After their CAPTAIN has seen enough-- He gives the order. \nAt that moment, the PLAINCLOTHES COPS in the crowd pull out their BADGES and start MOVING FORWARD through the sea of people, trying to make their way to the STAGE -- \nCube keeps SPITTING -- lyrics are approaching that mighty hook. \nThe UNDERCOVER COPS are causing a lot of commotion in the crowd... When CUBE hits the hook the CROWD JOINS IN, because they know all the lyrics -- \nCUBE & CROWD FUCK THA POLICE! -- FUCK! FUCK! FUCK THA POLICE!-- FUCK THAT POLICE! \nPOP-POP-POP -- Cube stops rapping -- the CROWD is momentarily STUNNED! What the hell was THAT? Gunfire? A fucking BOMB? Whatever it was, TOTAL CHAOS BREAKS OUT -- \nThe CROWD starts SURGING for the EXITS. Suddenly, DOZENS MORE COPS have MATERIALIZED OUT OF NOWHERE -- \nAll the members of NWA DROP their mics and rush off stage, while the Arena descends into mayhem behind them -- \n59   INT. JOE LOUIS ARENA - BACK STAGE - CONTINUOUS               59 \nIt's CHAOTIC. Tons of COPS, both UNIFORMED and UNDERCOVER, SWARM as the Guys RACE past a LIVID Eazy and Jerry -- \nEAZY What the fuck did you DO!? \nNo time for answers, THEY RUN TOO. Jerry can't believe the cops are on their tails. \n60   EXT. JOE LOUIS ARENA - LOADING AREA - CONTINUOUS             60 \nAll the GUYS try to make their way to an idling VAN which is waiting to whisk them away to safety, but -- \nREN Aw fuck... \nBecause they all just noticed TWO THINGS: 1) there are DOZENS of rabid FANS gathered outside, and 2) there are also A SHIT- LOAD OF POLICE, holding back the FANS. The GROUP is spotted by some COPS, who peel off and head STRAIGHT FOR THEM -- \nICE CUBE Here we go y'all... \nThe COPS are immediately ON them, grabbing, frisking, CUFFING, and DRAGGING them all toward a PADDY WAGON which has materialized outside. \nAnd as soon as the CROWD sees their beloved NWA being hauled away, they go NUTS, and start throwing BOTTLES and ROCKS at the COPS, who DUCK and SWERVE to avoid the projectiles. \nThe CROWD starts CHANTING, at a deafening volume -- \nCROWD FUCK THE POLICE. FUCK THE POLICE. FUCK THE POLICE. FUCK THE POLICE -- \nBefore it gets any hairier, the COPS start PILING NWA into the PADDY WAGON. JERRY HELLER tries to shove his way over -- \nJERRY You have no right! This is illegal! You can't do this -- \nBut the Detroit Cops don't give a shit, they SLAM Jerry up against a wall, hold him there. \nCOP Stay fucking put, old man! \nJerry watches helplessly as the Paddy Wagon PEELS AWAY into the night, taking our heroes away -- \n61   OMITTED                                                        61 \n62   INT./EXT.

TOUR BUS - MOVING                                         63 \nSilence, save the rumble of the road. Everyone sits by himself, semi-secluded. Nobody talks. They all just stare out the windows, embroiled in thought. Exhausted. Shell-shocked. \nJerry watches a NEWS REPORT on the riot at the Detroit show. \nJERRY What the fuck were you guys thinking? They can hold us libel for inciting a riot! No one cares that the police started it... \nDre, Ren and Yella start paying attention as Eazy switches channels. Finds another report about the riot. And another. And another. Images blurring by of the concert. \nJERRY (CONT'D) Whether you like it or not, you are a political group. Never give these assholes a reason to hurt you. Next time they might take it. \nThe guys watch, realizing that they're becoming a part of the zeitgeist. No longer in the news, they are the news. \nKURT LODER (PRE-LAP) The explosive Compton rap group, N.W.A. -- \nHARD CUT TO: \n64   CLOSE ON MTV NEWS REPORT (STOCK FOOTAGE)                       64 KURT LODER -- aka Niggers With Attitudes, officially had their video banned here at MTV due to gang-like images that could incite violence. This is not the first scrape with controversy for the band -- \n65   INT. HOTEL - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                 65 \nCLICK! CLICK! CLICK! NWA sit at a long table being interviewed for a PRESS JUNKET, dozens of microphones thrust in their faces, cameras flashing. All the members are engaged, leaning forward, elbows on the table. They got each other's back as WE PARACHUTE IN: \nJOURNALIST 1 How do you explain insighting a riot in Detroit? What do you have to say about that? \nEAZ We didn't insight shit. \nCUBE That's my money anyway, Jerry. I earned it. I wrote a lot of hit songs. I been on tour for months. (MORE) \nCUBE (CONT'D) Performing. Gettin' arrested and shit. And you gonna try to gank me? \nJERRY That's ridiculous. \nCUBE Give me my money, Jerry. \nJERRY You're kidding me, right? Who do you think pays for everything? All the hotel rooms, the parties, the transpo? You think that's free? \nCube closes his eyes. Takes a deep breath. He must literally will himself to not implant his fist in Jerry's face. \nCUBE Why all this now,   Jerry? Back in the beginning, if   you thought we were so good, why   didn't you just give us contracts   then? \nJERRY Nothing's a sure thing, Cube. Even a great talent can crash and burn. Too much ego, too much excess, too many expectations -- it tends to ruin things. You oughta keep that in mind. \nCube stares hard. Knows exactly what Jerry's implying. \nCUBE I'm gonna ask one more time. Are you sayin' I can't have the money I earned, unless I sign this contract, right now, without showin' it to anybody? \nJerry just crosses his arms, looks at Cube, says nothing. \nCUBE (CONT'D) Bye, Jerry. \nHe turns and walks out of the room -- \n69   INT. DOUBLETREE SUITES - LOBBY - DAY                        69 \nDre, Ren and Yella lounge on the lobby couch, packed bags beside them. And they couldn't be happier. \nREN I'mma get me a El Camino with some gold Daytons and a Phantom top. \nYELLA I can't wait to get out of that \"po- man's Porsche\" and get me some real shit -- \nFace crumpled with anger, Cube approaches. Drops his bags. \nCUBE Y'all signed that Ruthless contract without a lawyer? \nREN Yeah -- And we got paaaaaid! \nYELLA For $75,000 dollars, I don't give a fuck what's in that contract! \nDre and Ren chuckle at Yella's candor. \nDRE You ain't signed? \nCUBE Hell naw I ain't signin' that bullshit. Don't y'all think it's a little fucked up that Jerry won't let us show it to nobody? That seem honest to y'all? If he offered us seventy-five thousand, he probably owes us double that. (to Ren) Thought we talked about this, dude? \nREN It is what it is... I don't trust Jerry but I trust Eric. \nCube's disgusted by their ignorance. Only Dre seems to be considering Cube's words -- \nCUBE At this point, Eric and Jerry in this thing together. Believe dat! \n70   EXT. LEIMERT PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                           70 \nThe bus is parked back where the tour began. Exhausted, D.O.C. \nexits the bus and heads toward a BURGUNDY CHEVY BLAZER, where SUGE KNIGHT waits to pick him up. D.O.C. throws his bags in the back. Kicks it with Suge for a minute as -- \nEazy exits the bus with Yella. They watch D.O.C. and Suge. \nEAZY What up with Doc and Suge? \nYELLA Guess that dude's \"managing\" him now. One day you Bobby Brown's bodyguard, next day you reppin' talent. Everybody wanna get into the act... \nDre exits, looking discouraged. And we understand why when an equally despondent Cube exits the bus and begins to move away from the crew. Dre catches up to him -- \nDRE Yo Cube-- You can't just sign that shit, homie..? Keep making history..? \nCUBE Naw man, not like this. I'd rather be broke then get fucked -- Why did you sign that shit, Dre? \nDRE Nigga, I got bills to pay -- and I need to put some money in my Momma's hands after Tyree passed. \nCUBE Yo, I get it. Everybody gotta do what they gotta do. They're gonna take care you. You they're bread and butter. \nDRE Cube, we Ruthless. \nCUBE Nah, we NWA. They Ruthless. \nT-BONE (O.S.) You comin', Cube? \nCube turns to find T-BONE from the Lench Mob and Jinx, waiting for him in his CAR. He looks back at Dre -- I'm out. They pound hug and Cube heads off. Hops into T-Bone's ride. \nBACK WITH DRE, considering the scene as everyone drives away, going in separate directions: \nCube leaves with T-Bone... Yella leaves with Ren... Eazy leaves with Jerry... And D.O.C. leaves with Suge... \nDre finds himself all alone, confronting a new reality. \nA71   INT./EXT. T-BONES CAR - MOMENTS LATER                       A71 \nCube rides in the passenger seat, pretty low at this point. No money, no group. JINX MOUTH IS RUNNING, but Cube's in a daze -- doesn't hear a word he's saying. \nJINX Can't believe you left the group, man. What you gonna do now? Guess we gotta start working on some solo stuff, huh? Cube? Cube?! \nAs the car pulls up to a stop light, Cube looks over, spots a beautiful YOUNG LADY in a nice jeep on rims. She's looks back over at him, their eyes locked. Is this love at first sight? After a few magical moments. Cube finally speaks. \nCUBE How you doing? My name O'Shea. What's yours? \nKIM Kim. \nCUBE Hey Kim-- You the best thing I've seen all day. \nD.O.C. Interrupts -- \nD.O.C. Wuddup, Dre. There's some bitches up in here, right? (to Suge) Yo, you take care of that shit for me? \nSUGE I'm on it. \nDre takes notice of the exchange as we -- \nA74   INT. PRIORITY RECORDS - BRYAN TURNER'S OFFICE - DAY      A74 \nCube is standing in Bryan Turner's office, and we can tell, right off, things are tense. \nCUBE I'm just tellin' you what you told me. If Amerikkka's Most blew up, you'd advance me for the follow-up. That's what you said. \nBRYAN TURNER It's more complicated than that, Cube, there's metrics -- \nCUBE Come on, Bryan. I don't even know what that means. (MORE) \nCUBE (CONT'D) Man, I got a kid on the way -- and I just bought a house on the strength of what you told me. You gave me your word. \nBryan stands up, holds his hands out, tries to soothe -- \nBRYAN TURNER Cube. Relax. We're on the same team here. I'm your biggest fan -- \nCUBE It's like this shit keeps happenin' to me, no matter what I do. When people do the work, they should get paid. Why you making it seem like I'm begging for some shit that's technically mine? \nBRYAN TURNER Of course your not begging -- and I'm not trying to be difficult. \nCube glances around at all the GOLD and PLATINUM records adorning the walls in Bryan's office. \nCUBE But you can't help me. That's what you're sayin'. \nBryan puts his hands in his pockets, hangs his head. The answer is obvious. Cube stares at him a beat, then turns his back, heads out the door -- \nBRYAN TURNER Cube, wait, Cube, come back -- \nB74   INT. PRIORITY RECORDS - BRYAN'S OFFICE - LATER              B74 \nBryan's still in his office, grinding through some work. \nCUBE (O.S.) Shoulda kept your word, Bryan. \nCUBE and THE LENCH MOB (same dudes we saw at Greene Street) enter, Cube holding a METAL BASEBALL BAT! IN A FLASH, he's SMASHING THE FUCK OUT OF THE OFFICE. His boys split up, block Bryan, block the doorway -- no one in, no one out. \nBRYAN TURNER STOP! STOP! WHAT THE FUCK, CUBE!??! \nCube SMASHES the GOLD and PLATINUM RECORDS on the WALLS, the ARTWORK, the GLASS COFFEE TABLE. Pretty much everything else that's breakable. \nBRYAN TURNER (CONT'D) FINE! FINE, I'LL GET YOU YOUR MONEY! JUST STOP! \nBut Cube keeps on SMASHING, until there's nothing left to smash. THE OFFICE IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED. \nCube's out of breath, but he looks pretty exhilarated. He drops the bat on the floor, walks out of the decimated office, followed by the other guys. \nBryan remains standing there, speechless, in shock -- \n74   INT. AUDIO ACHIEVEMENTS STUDIO - LATER                       74 \nDre, Eazy, Ren and Yella work on their follow-up album. D.O.C.'s here, too, drinking gin, straight, buzzing. \nIN THE BOOTH, Ren's recording REAL NIGGAZ... \nREN ... Prisoner like a hostage. You shoulda covered your muthafuckin' head like an ostrich. Deep in the dirt cause you a sucka. And your ass up high so I can kick the muthafucka -- \nDre watches from the board, uncharacteristically detached. \nEAZY That's what I'm talkin' about. Cube ain't shit. \nDRE How you figure? That record's still the hottest shit out there. \nYELLA For real. Cube killed it -- \nEAZY That's why we gotta go hard at him. We gonna look like some bitches if we just take that shit. \nD.O.C. Take what? (beat) I don't know what the fuck you talkin' about. I like that shit. \nYella nods, but Dre doesn't even respond. Just keeps plodding away on the board as D.O.C. proceeds unsteadily toward the door, bumping into Eazy on the way -- \nEAZY Man, why you gotta be drunk all the time? Get your shit together. \nD.O.C. keeps on walking, barking back: \nD.O.C. Get your own shit together, lil nigga -- \nAs he exits we focus back on the studio. One thing's clear: no one's enjoying themselves anymore. \n75   INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                 75 \nEazy enjoys dinner with a lovely, put-together young woman, TOMICA. She's nobody's groupie. She's serious, and smart. \nTOMICA This place is nice. Wow, I didn't realize this was a real \"date\" date. I thought we were just going out to eat. You bring all your females here? \nEAZY Only the special ones. (beat) Actually I've never been here before, but I heard it's good. (Jokingly) High as it is, it better be. \nHe smiles. She laughs affably, shakes her head. \nTOMICA You know I have a job, right? \nEAZY Excuse me, Miss Record Executive. \nTOMICA Executive Assistant. Ya know, you don't have to impress me. We could've went to Fat Burgers. I just like hangin with you. You make me laugh. That's good enough for me, you know? We can just chill. \nEazy nods, knows she's right. His eyes catch a SEXY WOMAN sashaying past. He SMILES at her, and she SMILES back. \nDre and D.O.C. sit and listen to NO VASELINE-- with every line D.O.C. makes a different \"dunk face\" indicating how embarrassed he is for his homie Dre. \nCUBE (ON TRACK) Yella Boy's on your team so you're LOSIN'! And yo, Dre? Stick to producin'. Callin' me Arnold, but you Been-A-Dick. Eazy saw your ass, and went in it QUICK. \nAs we pan over to Dre, we can see that he kind of digs the creativity and lyrics. He confirms it with a slight smirk and chuckle. Clearly blowing the song off. \n78    INT. JERRY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                              78 \nNO VASELINE CONTINUES over -- \nJerry and N.W.A., minus Dre and D.O.C., listen to the track, faces grimaced: \nCUBE (ON TRACK) Y'all disgrace the C-P-T. `Cause you gettin' fucked out your green by a white boy, with No Vaseline. \nRen and Yella slouch in the corner, looking very unhappy. \nCUBE (ON TRACK) (CONT'D) ... So don't believe what Ren say, cause he goin out like Kunta Kinte. But I got a whip for ya, Toby; used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me -- \nBut Cube has saved the best for last. He unleashes upon EAZY and JERRY, who LISTEN intently, jaws dropped. \nCUBE (ON TRACK) (CONT'D) You little maggot, Eazy E turned faggot. With your manager, fella, fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella. But if they were smart as me, Eazy E would be hangin' from a tree. With no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline. Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on. Til that Jheri curl is gone. On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation. Heard you both got the same bank account -- Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' about? Get rid of that Devil real simple: put a bullet in his temple. Cuz you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew with a white Jew tellin' you what to do -- \nJerry looks absolutely livid, while Eazy just looks caught off guard. Jerry gets up and TURNS OFF the music -- \nYELLA That shit's kinda funny. \nEverybody gives YELLA the look. \nREN Mothafucka got us! What we gonna do? I got my pen ready to serve that fool. Just say the word. \nEazy is still trying to digest the track. \nJERRY We'll sue that worthless fuck. Defamation, libel... That anti- Semitic piece of shit, I'm gonna call up my friends at the J.D.L. and we'll see how he likes that, little bastard. (off Eazy's despondent look) Eric, come on, we gotta get organized here, we gotta fight -- \nEAZY Stop it, Jerry. Relax man. Niggas don't know what anti-Semitic means - - It's just a battle rap. \nJERRY (still hopping mad) I always knew Cube was a rotten human being. And people are gonna know the facts. I'll make sure of it. I can't believe you're not as angry as I am, what's wrong with you? Didn't you hear what he said? \nEAZY I heard it, Jerry. You deal with it your way, I'll deal with it mine. All we got to do is hit the studio and end this boy career. \nYELLA I don't know about all that. \nJERRY Well call Dre and you guys go do it! \nAnd Jerry storms out, leaving the crew behind -- \nREN Damn, E. Who work for who? \nEAZY Who you see sitting in the big chair mothafucka?! \nEazy re-establishes that he's the top dog at Ruthless. \n79   OMITTED                                                    79 \n80   OMITTED                                                    80 \n81   EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE - FRONT - NIGHT                         81 \nJerry pulls into his driveway, gets out of the car, carrying a bag of groceries, starts walking toward the door. He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM, and he TURNS, sees a gleaming-new EL CAMINO parked across the street. A very large BLACK MAN we haven't seen before has emerged, and is walking toward him. \nThe Man STOPS about fifteen feet away from Jerry, and stands there, just staring, patiently, ominously. \nJERRY Help you with something? \nLARGE MAN This your house? \nJerry looks at the Man. Glances up and down the street. There's nobody around. It couldn't be quieter. \nJERRY Who's asking? \nLARGE MAN It's a real nice house. \nJerry glances at the front door of the house. Seems to be gauging, in his mind, how long it will take to get there. \nJERRY Who are you? Are you with Suge Knight? Someone else? Ice Cube? \nThe Man doesn't answer. Instead, he just gazes upon the house, the lush surrounding lawn, the trees. \nLARGE MAN Have yourself a good night, Jerry. \nHe makes a hat-tipping gesture to Jerry. Except he's not wearing a hat. Then he walks back to the car, climbs inside. Jerry watches him go, alarmed -- \n82   INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - NEW YORK CITY - DAY                     82 \nWe are in a HALLWAY adjacent to the AUDITORIUM where a RAP PANEL is about to take place. \nFind CUBE drifting down the escalator along with THE LENCH MOB, and they're all decked out in their Lench Mob Gear. \nComing up the escalator on the other side, is the rap group ABOVE THE LAW (ATL), all wearing gear blazing the RUTHLESS RECORDS logo. \nAs the two groups approach each other, they both get QUIET, and their faces pull into angry sneers. The animosity between the two groups is tense, palpable, dangerous. \nJust as they're about to PASS each other -- \nATL GUY 1 (under his breath) Fuckin' traitor... \nBut Cube and his boys heard that shit. \nCUBE Fuck'd y'all say!? \nATL GUY 2 Ruthless, muthafuckas! \nAND THEN IT POPS OFF! Some of the ATL CREW hop the escalator divider, others sprint down the other side to attack -- \nJOURNALIST Are you Anti-Semitic? \nCUBE What? I thought this interview was about the Rodney King trial? \nJOURNALIST The J.D.L. has recently gotten involved, saying that the lyrics regarding your former manager Jerry Heller -- \nBut Cube's too smart to fall for this crap. \nCUBE I'm not Anti-Semitic. I'm Anti- Jerry Heller. Let me ask you a question -- do they condone Jerry's behavior when it comes to my situation? Him trying to get me to sign a contract without legal representation? \nJOURNALIST I have no idea. \nCUBE Well, you get me that answer and then we can continue on this topic. Until then, let's talk about the beating of an unarmed motorist -- Rodney King and the trial of 4 guilty L.A.P.D. Officers who seem to be Darryl Gates' standard issue - \nJOURNALIST But it isn't just the Jewish community. The Korean grocer community have also accused you of racism, mostly because of your song \"Black Korea\" -- \nCUBE Come on, man. That don't even make no sense. Black Korea is just a warning. That's it. I'm a journalist, just like you! Reporting on what's going on in the hood. But the difference is that I'm brutally honest about it. Cause sugar coating will get you diabetes. \nA couple of members of the Nation of Islam are quietly seen in the background as the journalist struggles, tries to gain a foothold -- \nJOURNALIST What's your relationship with the Nation of Islam? \nCube just smiles, shakes his head. \nCUBE There my brothers. That question alone just proves how unprepared of a \"sandbag reporter\" you really are. You wanna talk about Anti- Semitism? Then it's \"Black Korea,\" and now you wanna talk about the Nation of Islam? Seriously, man. What's your agenda? You can't focus on one thing? Ask me something interesting. I'm not an elected official. I'm an artist. You haven't asked me one damn question about music. I'm America's conscience. I represent the good, the bad and the ugly. What you represent? \n92   INT. DRE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                      92 \nThe massive room's focal point is a BASIC STUDIO SETUP: SSL, some turntables, a mic, some keyboards, a tower of speakers. \nSUPERIMPOSE: SIX MONTHS LATER \nDre sits in the epicenter of it all, motionless, lost. It's the first time we've seen him anywhere near a soundboard and not creating on it. He just stares into the nothingness -- \nA TAP ON GLASS alerts us to SNOOP, Warren G and DOC (small scare on DOC's neck) outside. Dre stands. Opens the window. \nDRE What you fools doin' out here? \nWARREN G Watching you daydream for the last five minutes. \nDOC (raspy voice) Looking stupid as a mothafucka. \nSNOOP Come take a ride with us Dr. Dre. You gotta get out this house, Cuz and get your mind right. \nINT. DRE'S CAR - LOS ANGELES - MINUTES LATER \nSnoop at the wheel, they ride listening to ATOMIC DOG by George Clinton. Snoop's at the wheel, smoking a JOINT (surprise), Dre shotgun, Warren G and D.O.C. in the back. \nSNOOP What you so tense for, Cuz? \nDRE I'm cool. \nWARREN G No you not. You been up in that house for a month now, and not one track? Wassup, what's wrong? \nDRE First time in my life, I feel like I'm forcin' it. \nWARREN G Why? \nDRE Too much outside interference -- Eazy and Jerry tryin' to starve me out. Playin' games with my money. Tryin' to get me back in there on my hands and knees -- \nSNOOP Is that why you ain't got no furniture? \nSnoop holds out the jay. \nSNOOP (CONT'D) This shit'll chill you out. \nDRE Nah, that ain't me. I'm good. \nWARREN G Come on, big bro. Loosen up. \nDRE (reconsidering) Fuck it, gimme that shit. \nDre takes a deep pull, holding it in before COUGHING out a massive cloud. They all laugh. And Dre takes another hit. An even bigger one. \nDRE (CONT'D) Wow. What is in this shit? \nSNOOP That shit right there? That's the Chronic. \nDre TURNS UP the music. \nSNOOP (CONT'D) You never smoked before? \nDRE No. I can feel it in my nuts, man. Is that normal? \nDre finds himself laughing with the guys as they cruise on... \n94   INT. DRE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                         94 \nDre's behind the SSL, listening to a rhythm based on Leon Heywood's I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING FREAKY TO YOU. Warren G, Snoop, and D.O.C are in different corners of the room. Smoke floats over Snoop's head like a halo. \nThe vibe is positive and laid back, but as we look at Dre's face we can tell what he's thinking: something's missing. \nDre turns to the MOOG Keyboard situated on the side of the board and starts noodling with a melody. It's almost familiar. But not quite. \nThen he hits it: Da do dee dah dee dah dah dee do deee... \nJust like that, we've witnessed the birth of AIN'T NUTHIN' BUT A G THANG. \nSNOOP Oh shit. Keep playing that. \nDre does the same ten notes -- That's it! It's G THANG. \nSNOOP (CONT'D) (freestyling) One. Two. Three into the Four. Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door... (rap continues) \nCUBE Hey Darrell. What you been doing? -- playin' with Shea? \nDarrell nods as Kim picks up the remote, starts FLIPPING channels. She STOPS when it lands on THE BOX, which just happens to be playing NWA's STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON. Cube watches for a bit, lost in thought -- \nKIM Look how young you guys look. \nCube looks for a moment -- shakes his head, in disbelief. \nCUBE Damn... We left some good records on the table... \nKim walks closer-- rubs his shoulders lovingly... \nKIM Well-- ain't nobody burnt down the table did they? Ever thought about getting back together? \nCUBE All the time. But we've been feuding for so long. It might be \"ON\" on sight when we see each other. I really don't know. \nKIM That's a shame. It's terrible how money tears us apart. \nCUBE Yeah-- When it should be bring us together. Somebody always wants more then they're suppose to get. As that's when shit get funky. \nShe nods in agreement -- as he continues working on his script. A movie called \"FRIDAY\". \n112   INT. NICE RESTAURANT - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                  112 \nDre's having dinner with NICOLE -- the woman who rejected him at his party. Even though they're both clearly feeling this. \nDRE Aren't you glad I tracked you down? \nNICOLE I wasn't exactly hiding. \nThey both chuckle. \nDRE So wassup, you been havin' good time? \nNICOLE Yeah... Why? \nDRE Well I mean, I like comin' over your place, but you know, your neighbors be complainin' about \"the noise\" -- \nNicole smiles, shoos Dre. He smiles at her, mesmerized. God damn this girl is special. He fills up their champagne. \nDRE (CONT'D) I think a little more privacy would be better. \nNICOLE So what, you want me to move? \nDRE Yeah, maybe. I know of a perfect spot. Plenty of room, and I know the owner. \nNicole finally gets what Dre's saying. Smiles. \nNICOLE After a few months, you sure you're ready for that, Andre? \nDRE Yeah. I'm really feelin' you like that. \nNICOLE I'm feelin' you too, but... \nNicole considers, conflicted. Dre can't stand it any longer. \nDRE Hey you know what, don't worry about it right now. Was just a thought... \nDre drinks his glass of champagne down. \nDRE (CONT'D) Listen, I don't mean to change the temperature in here. But it had to be crazy, bein' married to a Laker. \nNICOLE Wasn't what I'd call a good fit. It got crazy once we moved to L.A. I definitely went through some unnecessary shit when he started acting like an asshole. But I have a beautiful son and all that other nonsense is behind me now. \nDRE Look, no offense, but I'm a little glad he was an asshole. (raising his glass) His loss is my gain. To assholes. \nNICOLE (playfully) Chin-chin. \nThey share a laugh as Nicole raises her glass -- CLINK. Dre downs his glass as we -- \n113   EXT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT - WESTWOOD - LATER                113 \nDre walks Nicole to her door, and pretty soon they're kissing. It's nice, but after a bit, she pulls away. \nNICOLE All right -- Good night. \nDre looks surprised. \nDRE Really? Good night? \nNICOLE Are you okay to drive? \nDRE No. \nThey both laugh. \nNICOLE Good night, Andre. \nDRE See, I can't help thinkin', maybe you want me to come inside... \nNICOLE Of course I do. \nDRE So what's different now? \nNICOLE I got a lot of things to think about. (beat) You're asking me to move in... That's a big step. I like you, Andre. But there's a lot going on around you. \nDRE What do you mean? \nNICOLE I read the papers. I'm not stupid. I know about the whole Death Row business, the assault charges, the shooting... Just seems dangerous. My son's my world. \nDRE But I thought we been havin fun. \nNICOLE Fun is fun, Andre. But I refuse to walk away from one crazy life into another. \nCop raises the glass. \nDRE (CONT'D) Really, ok... \nSUGE (laughing) Who fuckin' shit up! You trippin. We can do anything we want to do. We started this shit. This is us. \nDRE Nah, Nigga. Death Row is us. (pointing around) This other shit -- is you! \nSuge's Goons get in position. \nGOON #1 Better watch ya mouth, Blood. \nDRE 'Tha fuck you talking too? \nGOON #2 (dismissive) Nigga, you ain't nothing but a producer around here. \nDRE What the fuck?!!! \nThis sends Dre into orbit. He goes after Blood #1. The whole conference room jumps in between them -- keeping these two human pit bulls from scrappin'. Everybody jumps but Suge who amused by the whole thing -- puffs on his cigar. Dre is being held back by the Off Duties. While Goon #1 is being held back by Goon #2 and a few others. World War III averted for now. \nDRE (CONT'D) Get the fuck off me. \nDre breaks free and storms out. \nSUGE Man don't even trip off this muthafucka. What he going to do? Where he going to go? \n113pt2 TESTAROSA                                             113pt2 \nAnd just sits there, seething. Reaches in the back seat, grabs a bottle of Hennessey. Takes a swig... Then -- \nA sudden look of determination washes over him. He TEARS out into the street, tires SQUEALING -- ERRRR! \nPASSING CARS, swerving, Dre punches the gas, RPMs maxed out. Shifts, flying through an intersection -- the needle passes 100mph. Keeps going, loving the release, the control... \nA POLICE CRUISER, coming the opposite direction, spots Dre's Testarosa -- In a flash, they bang a U-turn, peeling so fast, smoke clouds the night air -- \nON DRE, distant police lights now strobing off of his face from the rear view mirror. Fuck! Thinking fast, he switches off his headlights. Hits the gas, needle bottoming-out! \nAs he reaches the next intersection, Dre makes a hard left -- SCREECHES to a stop, tucking into a spot along the side of the road. Shuts off his car. Waits, breathing fast, as -- \nDRE (TO HIMSELF) Come on, come on, come -- \nTHE POLICE CRUISER barrels around the corner -- SLAMS THE BRAKES! Two LAPD OFFICERS fling open their doors, guns leveled at Dre's car! \nEyes wide, adrenaline coursing through his veins, chest heaving, Dre grits his teeth. He's stuck... and he knows it. \nLAPD OFFICER 1 (VIA LOUDSPEAKER) Driver! Put your hands out of your window where we can see them! Now! \nDre complies, reaches his hands out of his window. \nThe two officers carefully approach, guns at the ready. OFFICER 2 slaps the cuffs on Dre, regret immediately registering on his face as we -- \nSMASH CUT TO: \n114   EXT. JAIL - PASADENA - ESTABLISHING - DAY                   114 \nNicole hops out of her car and hurries into -- \n115   INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY                             115 \nDre and NICOLE sit across from each other, Plexiglas between them, talking via phone receivers. \nNICOLE Anybody else been here to see you, your so-called friends at Death Row? \nDRE Nope. You're the only one I wanna see anyway. \nShe surveys him, pain in his eyes. \nNICOLE 112 days? That doesn't even make sense. \nDRE Yeah, well... That's what happens when you violate your probation. \nThey sit there, just being in the awkward, contrived moment. \nNICOLE You got one phone call and you called me? \nDRE `Cause you were right. Only other person that tells it to me like it is-- is my moms. So I know you care. \nShe looks at him, nods, dabs at her wet eyes. \nDRE (CONT'D) I fucked up. But I've had a lot of time to think in here, and I promise you, things are gonna be different from now on. \nThat lies there a minute. Then -- \nNICOLE You take care of yourself, Andre. \nShe stands, heads away... And we see the reflexive disappointment on Dre's face before... \n116   INT. EAZY'S NORWALK HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                 116 \nTomica and Eazy lie in bed together. He stares at the ceiling, and she runs her hand soothingly down his arm. \nEAZY I feel like I don't know what I'm doin' anymore. I don't even know where the money's going. \nTomica props herself up on her elbow, looks at him. \nTOMICA I can help, you know. Show me the files, the bills, the contracts. I know the business, I know how it all works. Let me look. Baby, if you're feelin' this way, Jerry's not doin' right by you. \nEazy puts his arm around her, pulls her close. They both lie there a little longer, just breathing. \nEAZY Okay. After New York. Workin' on that International Distribution with Sony. Jerry don't know about that. I wanna keep it that way. \nTomica nods, smiles. Encouraged he has a plan again. \nJerry has the PAPERS on the counter for Eazy's signature. But something's different this time. Eazy doesn't just sign. Instead, he starts GATHERING the papers into a pile. \nJERRY Wait, aren't you gonna sign -- \nEAZY I'mma take these home with me. I'll sign 'em. Get'em back to you in a couple days. \nJerry looks alarmed. \nJERRY But this is how we've always done it. You have a lot on your plate Eric, there's no need to add to it -- \nEAZY It's cool, Jerry. They're my bills, my checks. I mean look, my name's right there. \nEazy grins at Jerry, points to his name on the checks. \nJERRY I just wish we could do it here. I don't want anything to get misplaced or lost -- \nEAZY Don't worry so much, Jerry. I can handle it. \nEazy picks up the pile of papers and heads for the door. Jerry stares after him, visibly shaken -- \n123   INT. EAZY'S NORWALK HOUSE - NIGHT                           123 \nTomica watches on as Eazy finishes READING the immaculately- organized PAPERS she's laid out for him. He puts them down. \nTOMICA You had to know the truth sometime. Now you do. \nEAZY Cube tried to warn me. So did Dre. And I didn't listen. I fucked up. \nAnd we stay with Eazy a moment, reeling, pissed.... \n124   INT. JERRY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER                        124 \nEazy walks into their familiar meeting place to find Jerry slumped at the table. \nJERRY Where the fuck have you been? I've been calling you -- \nJerry glances down at the PAPERS in Eazy's hand, sees the flat look on Eazy's face... and gets it. \nJERRY (CONT'D) So what was it, the groupie? The executive assistant? Did she even go to college? Come on. You're smarter than that, Eric -- \nEAZY This ain't about Tomica, Jerry. It's about you. And you really gotta stop acting like you never did anything wrong. \nJERRY Look, I know you're upset. But I'd strongly advise you to take a breath, let me look at the paperwork -- \nEric lets out a low, rumbling laugh. \nEAZY Jerry, for real? You can stop givin' me advice. As of, like, now. I'm getting NWA back together. It's happening. But you ain't gonna have nothing to do with it this time. \nJerry's voice starts to RAISE in volume, desperation growing. \nJERRY Why would you say something like that? You're not thinking straight. (MORE) \nJERRY (CONT'D) I know what's best for you, and for Ruthless, and we've built a trust over years of hard work. That trust is our foundation, Eric. \nEazy laughs again, but this time... the laugh deteriorates into a ragged, hacking COUGH. Jerry watches, concerned -- \nJERRY (CONT'D) Are you okay? You don't look -- \nEAZY Trust. God damn, that's a word. Let me tell you somethin', Jerry. Trust is a muthafucka. \nJerry is now full-on YELLING at Eric, who remains calm. \nJERRY Look, if what I've done is so illegal, why have I never been sued? I'm such a thief, such a liar, such a motherfucker, how come nobody's come to collect? This is business. This is how it works. It's not always pretty, but all of it, everything I've put into this company, my whole LIFE for all these years, it's for you, Eric. \nEazy absorbs this. Then -- \nEAZY You're fired, Jerry. \nJerry, who is now beet-red, starts to BELLOW with rage -- \nJERRY Goddammit, Eric! This is not how we do things! This is a business and I won't let you -- \nBut Eazy's already out the door. Enraged, Jerry wipes his arm across the table sending everything SMASHING onto the floor! \n125   INT. DRE'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY                          125 \nLong gone are the days of the infamous Dr. Dre pool parties as Dre and Nicole relax by the pool. Dre's huge, early-model CELL PHONE rings from a table beside him. He picks it up -- \nDRE Hello? \nAfter a short pause, a familiar, gravelly voice comes on. \nEAZY'S VOICE Wassup Andre, it's Eric. \nDre's eyes widen. Eazy's the last person he ever expected to hear from. \nDRE Yeah? Wassup wit you? \nINTERCUT WITH: \n126   INT. EAZY'S NORWALK HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS         126 \nChilling by his modest pool, Eazy looks worn but determined. \nEAZY Just felt like callin' -- \nDre is still vaguely mystified, at a loss. \nDRE Yeah. Okay. (beat) Wassup? \nEAZY You know. Doin' my thing. Makin records. Killin' all that pussy out there. \nSeated a few feet away from Eazy, Tomica rolls her eyes. \nDOCTOR Mr. Wright. You need to understand. You're very, very sick -- \nEAZY But I don't even feel that bad... \nDOCTOR With treatment, and palliative care, we can probably keep you comfortable for... maybe six months. At the very most. \nPanic washes over Eazy in a flood -- \nEAZY Comfortable? What you mean comfortable? Six months!? \nDOCTOR I'm truly sorry, Mr. Wright. \nEazy realizes that he's dying. \nHARD CUT TO: \n130   B-ROLL OF A CROWD OUTSIDE OF CEDARS SINAI (STOCK FOOTAGE) 130 \nREPORTER (V.O.) Last week, the rap world was stunned to learn in a press conference held by his lawyer, that Eazy-E had been admitted to Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles and diagnosed as suffering from full- blown AIDS. \n131   INT. CUBE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                             131 \nWE HEAR the STOCK FOOTAGE CONTINUE over -- \nAt home, sitting on the couch with Kim and their KIDS, Cube watches on, stunned. Kim kisses him, leans on his shoulder as they try to process the shock -- \nRON SWEENEY (ON TV) Eazy started getting sick about a month ago but hadn't shown signs of improvement, so he checked into the hospital. They ran extensive tests and as a result we found out that... he has what he has... \n132   EXT. CEDARS - COURTYARD - DAY                              132 \nOutside the hospital, we see PEOPLE have started to GATHER. About a dozen or so. They stand there quietly, shuffling around, staring up at the Hospital -- \n133   INT. CEDARS - EAZY'S ROOM - THE NEXT DAY                   133 \nTomica sits in a chair pulled right beside Eazy's bed. They hold hands, look at each other. They've both been crying. \nEAZY Just glad you're okay. You and the baby. \nTomica takes his hand, kisses it, cries. \nTOMICA No. We can beat this. Together. \nEazy nods reassuringly, but you can see in his eyes he doesn't believe it. Eazy's PHONE rings. He answers it. \nEAZY Yo. \nREN'S VOICE (filtered) Eazy! What the fuck, cuz? People been sayin' some crazy shit. Like you got AIDS or somethin'? Can you believe that? Muthafuckin' Eazy-E got AIDS? Niggas be starting too many rumors, huh? \nSILENCE. Ren is hit with the reality as Eazy TURNS OFF the phone -- Sticks it in the bedside table drawer. It's pretty clear he's never gonna turn it on again. \nTOMICA Who was that? \nEazy doesn't respond, just lies there, despondent. \n134   EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - VIDEO SHOOT - DAY                       134 \nDre's chilling on a couch as NICOLE appears from around the corner holding a wireless phone -- \nNICOLE It's for you. \nHe grabs the phone, leans it on his shoulder. \nDRE What up. \nDre's face contorts with confusion as he listens... \n135   INT. CEDARS - EAZY'S ROOM - NIGHT                         135 \nTomica and Yella stand by Eazy's bedside. Eazy looks drained, depressed. Various members of Eazy's FAMILY are also present. Yella holds a CASSETTE in his hand. \nYELLA It's Bone Thugs' new LP. It's good, Eric. It's gonna be huge when it drops. Everybody thinks so. Want me to play it for you? \nEAZY Put it on the table.

It's gotta happen, baby. I'm having my surgery tomorrow, so it has to happen now. Because I might not. Wake up. \nEazy's clearly struggling to come to terms with this. \nTOMICA Don't say that. \nEAZY It's true, Tomica. I gotta make this right. Ron says it's the only way to protect everything I built. \nTomica looks to Ron, who nods. She stares off into space, slowly shaking her head. Her life has become a nightmare. \nTOMICA It's so... fucked up -- \nEAZY Hey. Listen to me. It doesn't matter what people think. They don't know. They don't understand. There's no other way. Please. I know it's not the way you pictured it. You deserve better. \nHe reaches out, puts his hand on her stomach. \nEAZY (CONT'D) But if we don't do this, I won't be able to protect either of you. \nAfter looking deep into Eazy's eyes -- He needs her. \nTOMICA Okay. I love you, Eric. \n", "test1_input": "The sound of FOOTSTEPS as Ren, Yella, Cube, and Eazy exit the bus, surround Dre. They can tell something is very wrong. \nYELLA Yo, Dre. What's goin' on? \nON DRE as he forces back the tears that wanna come, his voice barely a whisper: \nDRE My Moms called. Tyree. He's dead. Somebody killed my little brother... \nShocked: \"What?\" \"Hell naw!\" \"What happen?\" are heard amongst Cube, Eazy, Yella and Ren-- they crouch down next to Dre. Not sure what else to say or do. They wait for Dre to say more... \nDRE (CONT'D) He got into a fight near Leimert Park. A big mothafucka fell on top of him -- broke his neck. He killed Tyree. I can't believe this shit. \nFace buried in his hands, Dre quietly weeps. \nJinx, Laylaw and DJ Speed gather in the front window of the bus. Not wanting to interrupt the group's moment. \nCube rests a hand on Dre's shoulder as the others tighten the circle. There's silence... until: \nCUBE Never told y'all, but when I was twelve, my sister got murdered by her own husband-- A fuckin' wanna be cop who couldn't make it in the academy. Life changed for me that day. Everything became serious-- \nEAZY Dope game took my cousin's life. I remember when they found him. \nDRE He shoulda been out here with me. If he was out here-- It never woulda happened... \nREN Or it could've happened in another way. Can't blame yourself, Dre... Life has to end for all of us, but love don't. Feel me? Tyree is always gonna be with you. No matter what. \nEazy moves closer. Slowly, he places a hand on Dre's head. Rubs it. It's a bit startling -- Eazy's not one for tenderness. But it's clear he feels Dre's pain. \nEAZY Gonna be aiight, Dre... We with you. \nPULL BACK as the guys remain clustered around Dre.

She cries without end or apology, surrounded by family, including his other brother, WARREN G, plus Eazy, Cube, Ren and Yella. \nIt's solemn and quiet. Dre remains stoic, staring hard, trying his best to remain strong for his mother. All members of the band keep a close eye on him, as the pastor wraps up his eulogy. \nPASTOR Death is a threshold we all have to pass through. No one is exempt. Tyree will set a place for us on the other side and we will see him again. The flesh will always return to the earth. But our spirits will live on forever. Amen! \nThe congregation repeats the pastor with a follow up \"Amen.\" \n54   INT.

Keeps his head bowed. \nVERNA (CONT'D) Andre. \nDRE We was supposed to kick it... Next chance I got -- \nVERNA This is not your fault. Understand me? Stop this nonsense. Stop it now. \nHe looks at his momma. This strong woman. \nVERNA (CONT'D) Your brother looked up to you. And you took great care of him. We both did. It's time to let someone else take care of him now. \nWith that, she can no longer hold back the tears. Dre hugs her, mother and son comforting each other. \nVERNA (CONT'D) I'm proud of you... So proud of you, baby... \nDre fights back tears of his own, the words he's longed to hear. As Verna slowly turns and walks away, Cube, Eazy, Ren and Yella surround him, brothers in arms. They walk out the Mausoleum. \n55      TOUR BUS MONTAGE:                                            55 \n55pt1   -- Rural farmland. Flyover-ville.

As long as it keeps 'em off my back for a minute. \nYELLA Maybe you should think about diversifying into my kinda shit. There's money in there, too. \nEazy laughs, shakes his head. \nEAZY What, makin' pornos? No thanks, man. That's your thing. I'll stick with this music shit. Once my new album right here's done, I'mma be fine -- \nEazy starts COUGHING. It doesn't sound great. \nREN You all right, man? \nEAZY Yeah. Just tired. All this shit, downsizin' to a new crib, just weighin' on me. I'll figure it out though. I always do. \nJERRY (O.S.) Eric -- \nJerry enters. Approaches Eazy. \nJERRY (CONT'D) Can you come by my office? I need you to sign some checks -- \nBut Eazy doesn't even look up at Jerry. \nEAZY I'll come when I can, Jerry. \nJERRY Eric -- \nBut Eazy just keeps ignoring him. Annoyed, Jerry exits -- \n108   EXT. DEATH ROW RECORDS - LOS ANGELES - DAY               108 \nDeath Row's a thriving office space, especially in contrast to Ruthless. A few DOPE CARS sit parked out front as -- \nDre SCREECHES up in his brand-new, WHITE FERRARI TESTAROSA -- Suge's just behind him in a RED MERCEDES SL AMG CONVERTIBLE. A car is parked in Suge's parking space. Suge blocks the car in. Suge's Goons wait for him to exit his car. Dre and Suge hop out, ALL EYES ON THEM -- \nDRE Man, this is just the beginning... We're building an empire. \nDre LAUGHS as ... \nSuge storms off, flanked by his GOONS, bee-lining for the EMPLOYEE'S. He grabs the Employee by the collar and hauls him out of his car to his feet. \nSUGE You're in my spot! \nThe Employee just gapes at Suge, speechless... \nDRE Suge, it's cool -- \nSuge shakes the Employee like a rag doll... \nSUGE Did you park in my muthafuckin' parking space or not? \nEMPLOYEE I didn't know, I -- \nSuge pulls out a PISTOL and CRACKS the Employee across the face with it, blood gushing from his nose -- \nStartled, Dre shoots to a stand. What the fuck!? Even more so when Suge drags the bleeding Employee across the parking lot before tossing him against a car. Suge give the guy his keys. \nSUGE Now move yo' piece of shit and park my car. \nWow... The guy is scared and confused at Suge's \"power drunk\" request. He slowly takes the keys. \nSUGE (CONT'D) -- And I bet not see one drop of blood in that mothafucka. \nAnd everyone watches in utter silence as Suge spins and struts into Death Row Records brand new offices. LOUD SILENCE. \nOff Dre, disturbed by Suge's violent display. \n109   OMITTED                                                     109 \n110   OMITTED                                                     110 \n111   INT. CUBE'S HOUSE - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                     111 \nCube sits in the living room, watching basketball, and doing something we haven't seen before: WRITING A SCREENPLAY. \nKim walks through, visibly PREGNANT, holding SHEA (1). Hands Cube a beer. He reaches for her, kisses her belly as their toddler, DARRELL (3), runs in. Hops up on Cube's lap. \n", "test3_id": 647}

LUCA I'm not sure. 
MICHELLE You asshole! 
Michelle moves off. 
ALONGSIDE THE BARN 
Luca runs up. 
MICHELLE I don't believe this.    You slept with that guy?! 
LUCA It's not what you think. 
MICHELLE Oh, please! What about Max? 
LUCA What about him? 
MICHELLE Don't you care about him at all?! 
LUCA Not like that: I'm straight!   I'm attracted to you! 
MICHELLE Oh, who cares, you idiot! And sorry to break it to you, but I'm straight too. 
LUCA No. This'll sound crazy, but I'm not who you think I am- 
MICHELLE Oh, Christ, Luke, -Luca: I know who you are! 
Luca stares, stunned. 
LUCA You know I'm a Zerophiliac?! 
MICHELLE Yes! So you can just go fuck yourself. -Literally! 
LUCA Does Max know who I am? 
MICHELLE What if he does? Do you? 
LUCA He's a guy! 
MICHELLE And you're a girl! 
LUCA I'm not! 
Michelle gestures "Oh really?!" 
LUCA (CONT'D) I'm not supposed to be! 
MICHELLE There's no supposed to be anything, you just ARE! 
LUCA Is that what you think?!   NO! 
MICHELLE Well, then congratulations! You're a guy, just like every other guy I ever met! I can't believe you slept with him! 
LUCA He was a woman! I was tricked.   I didn't know I'd switch. 
Michelle stares, incredulous. 
MICHELLE You're gonna' tell me he's a Z too?! Both of you?! 
LUCA Yes! 
MICHELLE Well, that's just perfect. What, is there something in the water around here?! 
LUCA She told me it would make it stop. That it would keep me from turning into a girl. 
MICHELLE So what?! Why's that so important to you?! There's no way this was gonna' work. 
LUCA Because I'm a Zerophiliac. 
MICHELLE Because you can't stand being one! Bye, Luca. 
LUCA (correcting her) Luke.

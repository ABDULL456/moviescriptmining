AMELIA And your surprise is, you robbed a bank. 
GEORGE Actually.    A university. They stop.    What on earth...? 
GEORGE (CONT'D) I've sort of persuaded Ed Elliot to create an Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at Purdue. And suggested a budget item of... He shrugs. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) ...oh, eighty grand. For a suitable `flying laboratory.' Her eyes just bug out.      No!   He nods, slowly.   Uh-huh.   And she... ...THROWS her arms around his neck, KISSING him hard enough 
G to startle passersby. It only makes him chuckle. 
EORGE (CONT'D) As I said, I've sort of persuaded Ed. There are a bunch of trustees and donors, tho. We have to get them on board. 
AMELIA Think I could help? He looks in her eyes. 
GEORGE Nah. She grins. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) By the way. That's not the surprise. It's not?    Uh-uh.   And he glances to... ...the window of the GALLERY they've stopped at. She sees a magnificently carved CHEST. On a crest in the front: AE. We PAN the surface, to see planes, oceans, a shamrock for the Londonderry landing, dozens more symbols of her triumphs, and in a bottom corner, looking up at all of this in wonder... ...a small cat.     In a long frock coat. GEORGE (a whisper) Merry Christmas. Her tears just come. She's standing on Park Avenue and she can't do anything about it. He reaches a tender hand... ...and strokes her hair.      He is her hero.   See it in her eyes. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Can't wait to see what you got me. She sniffles. 
AMELIA Cat food.    A whole case. 
INT. HOME, RYE - DAY 
Amelia at her writing desk.       Determined, focused.   She begins to write... 
AMELIA (O.S.) Dear Mr. President: Some time ago I told you and Mrs. Roosevelt about my confidential plans for a world flight. The chief problem is the jump westward from Honolulu... 
A s she writes, DISSOLVE TO... 
INT. DINING ROOM, PURDUE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT 
A glittering table surrounded by high rollers. George and President Elliot sit on either side of Amelia, who has risen to speak. 
AMELIA As President Elliot has said, it would be a shining adventure, beckoning with new experiences. Making me more useful to the program here at Purdue. She looks into the eyes of each in turn... 
AMELIA (CONT'D) It is much more. I believe that women should do for themselves what men have done - and occasionally what men have not. Yes? 
AMELIA (CONT'D) This might encourage other women toward greater independence of thought and action. And I know how deeply you gentlemen desire that. There is gentle laughter.   Amelia reacts in mock surprise. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) I know, of course, from my chats earlier in the evening. With each of your wives. More laughter.   Applause from a wife, then the others, then all. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) In that spirit, I want each of you to reach for your checkbooks... She regards their amusement.   And losing none of the warmth of her own smile... 
AMELIA (CONT'D) I mean that quite literally. This is an opportunity for me to exhibit the quality my husband admires most. 
G eorge and Amelia gaze at each other.

AMELIA (CONT'D) The capacity. To be relentless. 
INT. HANGAR - DAY 
The LOCKHEED ELECTRA, a sleek state-of-the-art aircraft with its gleaming metallic surface, nose up in the center of a huge space. Its engines are on hoists, being worked on by a team of MECHANICS. Eight-year-old Gore gazes up, as if he has never seen anything quite so wondrous. Amelia and Gene watch, with barely suppressed smiles. He's in a suit. She's in grease- stained overalls from working with the mechanics. 
GORE So you'd be the first one, right? ou always like that. First one? 
GORE (CONT'D) To fly around the world. 
AMELIA Well, there's Magellan, 400 years go. Actually, he didn't make it. And he died. And he used a boat. 
GORE So it's almost the same, except it's completely different. 
AMELIA Pretty much. He glowers at her.    She glowers back.

CONTINUED: 
LEONARD (re: snack cakes) Some provisions. 
RUDY We're only gonna be here a couple of hours. 
LEONARD When two o'clock rolls around, you'll be begging for one of these. 
Rudy shakes his head, removes his BAT from his backpack. 
LEONARD (cont'd) (re: baseball bat) I didn't bring my glove. 
RUDY Moron, the bat is for Jeff and Kenny. You know, to scare them a little. 
He swings it hard. 
RUDY (cont'd) Maybe it's best if we don't talk. Just listen. Listen for them, and don't fall asleep. 
LEONARD I'm wide awake. I could stay up all night. 
EST. EXT. WOODS - LATER THAT NIGHT 
The treehouse is illuminated by the full moon, which rests in the sky above. The thunderous sound of a million crickets fills the air. 
INT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Both boys lie asleep. A mosquito flies in through the window and buzzes past Leonard's ear. He haphazardly swipes at it in his sleep, wakes himself up. 
LEONARD Oh, shit. 
Rudy jumps awake. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RUDY What... What is it?    They here? 
LEONARD No. 
Leonard rises, picks up his bag and opens the TRAP DOOR in the floor. He is about to exit. 
RUDY Where you going? 
LEONARD They're not gonna show up, I'm goin' home. It's three o'clock- 
Suddenly, a FLAMING COCKTAIL comes flying through the window. It hits Rudy in the head, explodes and engulfs him in flames. 
EXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME 
Jeff and Kenny stand a few yards away from the treehouse. Both laugh at the sight of the flames inside. 
KENNY Now yours.     And aim for the window. 
Jeff lights his COCKTAIL. It misses the window and smashes into the side of the tree house. 
KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Ha ha, you suck. 
Jeff and Kenny hear Leonard and Rudy screaming from inside. 
JEFF You hear that? 
INT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME 
Rudy, now covered in flames, rolls on the floor, screaming. 
RUDY Put it out! Put it out! 
Leonard struggles to put out the flames with his backpack, but it's of no use. He spins around and finds the wall behind him, engulfed with flames. He screams, terrified. 
EXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME 
Jeff and Kenny are frantic. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JEFF They're in there!   They're in there! 
Jeff turns around and runs back home through the woods. 
INT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME

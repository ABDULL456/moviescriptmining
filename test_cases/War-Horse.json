{"train": "WAR HORSE \nWritten by \nLee Hall & Richard Curtis \nEXT. DEVON, ENGLAND. A SUMMER'S DAY, 1912. \nThe bucolic magnificence of the Devon countryside. We fly low over the high, thick hedges untouched for hundreds of years. The thick verdant countryside in all its splendor, ancient woodlands, fields of corn, and finally a paddock in a typical Devonshire dale. \nWe come to rest beside three farmers standing over a pregnant mare. The mare is in distress - she is about to give birth. The farmers calm the mare and tend to her gently with assurance and authority. \nWe pull back to see, ALBERT, a fifteen-year-old farm boy, watching the whole drama with delight from the paddock gate. \nFARMER Come on, easy, girl. Easy, girl. Easy. \nThe men hold the mare firmly, but clearly this is a difficult birth. \nFARMER 2 This is a stubborn one, huh? \nFARMER 3 There we go. Who's a clever girl? \nMoments later - the summer's sun glints off the wet, sticky hide of the foal (JOEY) - red hide, four white socks and a distinctive white cross on its forehead. \nSoon the creature is attempting its first clumsy steps. It is both awesome and comical to see the new born creature struggle to his feet, but eventually, he succeeds. Title: WAR HORSE \nEXT. PADDOCK/FIELD, DEVON. VARIOUS. \nWe follow Joey's progress over the course of his first year. His initial fearfulness, his connection with his mother, the intimacy of their relationship. \nAs Joey gets strong they run together, frolicking gayly in the last dregs of summer. Albert looking on. Joey notices him at the fence and they share a moment of connection. \nSpring: flowers are beginning to sprout by the hedgerows. Our boy Albert runs into the field. He takes an apple from his pocket - he holds it out tentatively. Joey approaches Albert with suspicion. Albert gently encourages him. \nHis mother paws the ground and neighs at Joey. He turns and runs over the field at her beck and call. \nAlbert tosses the apple to himself, ruefully - watches in awe as Joey races away with his mother. \nHe is a magnificent one year old. His distinctive red coat gleaming, now it is clear that he is half thoroughbred. He runs quickly around the field enjoying his own power and strength. \nLater - the three farmers open the gate and come into the field. Both Joey and his mother instinctively canter over to the two men, expecting food. The three men gently greet the horses and pet them, then we see one man has a noose made of a rope. He slips it round Mum's neck. She pulls back, Joey is shaken and bewildered but before he knows what's happening the second farmer is trying to get a similar rope around his neck. Joey balks and pushes the farmer aside, distressed to see his mother tethered. The farmer grabs Joey again and struggles with him, enlisting the help of the second farmer. With some effort they get the rope around his neck and calm him down. \nFARMER 2 Easy does it. Easy does it. Come on, steady does it. \nUnused to being tethered Joey pulls at the rope but the farmers are solid and firm. They gently lead Joey and his mother across the field to the gate and out into the road. \nThe whole road becomes overtaken by a flock of sheep on their way to the market. In the distance we hear the bustle of Market Day. \nEXT. THE MARKET. THE SAME. The farmers lead Joey and his mother through the chaos of the market and into an auction pen. They find themselves amongst a hoard of pigs, sheep and cows. Joey is agog at all of these creatures and all this life he had no idea existed. \nThe farmers lead the horses into a stall to await the auction. Joey is bewildered by all the noise - buttressed against a couple of mules and a cow. He is uncomfortable in this tight space. \nAn AUCTION WORKER holds a clipboard out for the lead farmer. \nAUCTION MAN 1 Mornin', pop. Put your mark here. Good luck. \nEXT. JOEY'S PEN. THE SAME. \nTwo men approach the pen. \nAUCTION MAN 2 Get the colt... \nOne man grabs Joey and pulls him out of the pen. Suddenly there is a look of horror on his face. His terrified mother realises they are being separated. Joey panics and desperately tries to get back to his mother, he rises up throwing the man who is leading him aside. Joey is out of control. The man regains control of Joey. \nAUCTION MAN 3 Whoa! Whoa! \nHe pulls Joey away from his mother, who lets out a heart- rending cry, paws the ground, and crashes her foreleg against the fence. Joey remains disoriented in the midst of the market day chaos. \nAUCTION MAN 3 (CONT'D) Easy... \nINT. MAIN AUCTION RING. THE SAME. \nThe auction ring is full of people of all shapes and sizes. There is a sense of celebration and busyness about market day. \nThey all look at Lyons in his suit and bowler hat. \nAUCTIONEER Do I hear twelve guineas? Twelve guineas? \nSI EASTON That's top price for a workin' animal. Ted! Save it for the shire! \nDAD There are big days and there are small days. Which will it be? \nAUCTIONEER Do I hear any advance on eleven guineas? \nAll eyes are on Lyons and his son - David is 15, smartly dressed. \nDAVID LYONS Just let him go, dad, I don't care for him, he's too... jumpy. \nLyons isn't listening to David; he's looking hard at Ted. \nLYONS Shall we say - twenty five? \nThe crowd gasps. This is clearly personal. \nSI EASTON Well, he's got you there. Nice try, Ted. \nANDREW You were great, Mr N. Gave him a run for his money. \nBut when he looks at Ted, Ted's eyes are locked into the eyes of his rival. \nAUCTIONEER Going, going... \nDAD Thirty. Thirty guineas! \nTotal silence. He stares hard at Lyons. Who simply smiles, raises an eyebrow, tips his hat and walks away. It dawns on Dad that he's won the auction. He breaks into a sweat. \nAUCTIONEER Thirty guineas. Thirty guineas. Going going gone - to Mister Ted Narracott. \nHe bangs his gavel. It's a done deal. \nSI EASTON What have you done, Ted? What have you done? \nDad doesn't acknowledge Si. \nMoments later - Ted stands staring at Joey, who looks back. Ted holds his reins numbly, accepts his receipt from the auction man in a kind of daze. \nSuddenly, Lyons appears at Dad's shoulder. \nLYONS Quite a beast, there. But what you gonna do with him - on a working farm? I hope you got the rent, Ted. I'll be around for it when it comes due. \nDad does not acknowledge Lyons. Lyons smiles and walks away with son David, and his cronies. Si shakes his head at Dad. \nSI EASTON You're a fool, Ted. And our Rosie'll never forgive you. \nEXT. NARRACOTT'S FARM. SUNSET. \nMRS. NARRACOTT kneels in her garden, digging up some carrots, when she sees Ted returning. \nDad walks down the hedged lane as the sun sets pulling Joey with him, his bad leg always moving slightly to the side. \nMrs. Narracott looks in horror and bewilderment at Joey and then at Dad. She is a good-looking, intelligent woman, but clearly her life is always hard. \nMRS. NARRACOTT What have you done? \nDad stands shamefaced as Albert - the boy we have already met - runs out of the house to join them. \nALBERT That's Mooney's colt! \nMRS. NARRACOTT You were supposed to buy a plow horse. \nALBERT You bought him? MRS. NARRACOTT What'd you pay for him? \nAlbert is totally taken by the horse. \nMRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D) How much, Ted Narracott? \nDAD I won't tell you a lie - though I would love to. Thirty guineas. \nEXT. FARMYARD. NEXT DAY. \nDad, with a hangover, hobbles off to work the fields. As he reaches the gate, HAROLD the goose snaps at his heels. Dad dismisses him with a stare and heads for the stables. \nEXT. THE FARMYARD, DAY. \nThe training episode: Albert walks Joey around the yard on the rope. It all seems to be going well. Mum looks on. Albert is clearly proud of his progress. \nEXT. PADDOCK. ANOTHER DAY. \nAlbert's friend, Andrew Easton, sits on a rock with an apple in hand to watch the training. \nAlbert sets Joey in a spot and tells him to wait. \nALBERT Whoa. I want you to stay there, Joey. Stay. That's it. Good boy. That's it, you've got it. \nOf course when Albert walks away, Joey follows. \nA game of \"Grandma's footsteps\" ensues as Albert patiently places Joey then walks away. \nANDREW Hey, look at him, Albie. He's playing \"Grandma's Footsteps.\" \nAlbert patiently leads Joey back to his starting position. \nALBERT Right, come on, Joey. Back you go. Come on. Back you go. (MORE) ALBERT (CONT'D) You're all right. That's it. Good boy. Right. You've gotta stay there, understand? \nAlbert walks away again. \nALBERT (CONT'D) That's it. Good boy. You've got it. Good boy. \nFinally Joey stays put. Andrew smiles, impressed. \nANDREW Good boy. Good. (TO ALBERT) Now call him. Whistle. \nALBERT Come now, Joey. Come on. \nAlbert whistles like an owl. Joey stands completely still. \nALBERT (CONT'D) You can come now, Joey. \nHe whistles again. Joey remains still. \nANDREW Don't think he fancies your owls. \nAlbert walks back to Joey, frustrated. \nALBERT No, I read it in a story. It's how the Indians used to summon their horses. He gently strokes Joey's nose. \nALBERT (CONT'D) Now, Joey, when I whistle, you've gotta come, understand? \nANDREW My dad had a dog who stayed when you called him. He used to run up behind you when you weren't looking, and uh... \nALBERT He's not a dog. He's just puzzling it through. \nAlbert runs further away than before and whistles. After a moment, Joey trots over to him. Andrew smiles broadly. \nANDREW Brilliant. Look at you. \nWith the basis established, Albert begins to train Joey to react to the owl whistle without his prompting. It's not all easy going - sometimes Albert makes progress, sometimes not. \nQUICK MONTAGE - Mrs. Narracott fills a bucket at the pump, then promptly spills it when Joey trots past her in response to an owl whistle. She calls off, frustrated. \nMRS. NARRACOTT Albie. \nDad heads out to the fields with a rake on his shoulder. There's an owl call and Joey trots past him in the background. Dad sees Albert welcome Joey by the haystacks, stroking his nose affectionately. Dad walks on, his expression inscrutable. \nJoey trots up a path, pursuing another owl call. After several more calls, he still can't spot Albert, until he cranes his neck up and sees Albert sitting in a nearby tree. Albert laughs. \nINT. FARM HOUSE. LATER. \nLyons is there with his son, David, and his unlikable cronies. He holds a meager handful of cash. Dad and Mum look chastened. The mood is sombre. \nLYONS There's only fifteen here. DAD The rest will come. \nDad is mad with anger and frustration - and in pain. He staggers to his feet and leaves. Albert calms Joey down. Mrs. Narracott returns the harness to its hook. \nMRS. NARRACOTT I knew this would happen soon as I laid eyes on him.... \nBut then she notices Dad has returned. He has a gun. \nMRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D) Ted. No. Ted, no! \nDAD He's worth nothing to me! If he won't take the collar, he's not worth a damn thing! \nALBERT Dad? He grabs the rifle, but Dad shoves him away. \nDAD Move aside. \nDad raises the rifle, but Albert wrestles for it again. \nALBERT Dad. Stop. \nFurious with frustration Dad throws Albert to the ground and takes aim at the horse. \nMrs. Narracott quickly pulls the gun aside. \nMRS. NARRACOTT You shoot that horse we have nothing. \nDad whips the gun back towards Joey to find Albert standing between them - right in front of the gun's barrel. For a second we think Albert will be inadvertently shot. \nMRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D) NO! \nDad pauses his finger just in time. Albert gently holds the barrel of the gun. Speaks calmly. \nALBERT You were right what you said, Dad. \"He'll do it,\" you told Lyons, \"He'll plow that field.\" And he will! You'll see. He'll show you. We'll show you. We'll get it done. \nDad looks at him, frozen. Mrs. Narracott eases the gun away from him - MUM Let go. Let go. \n- and hands it to Albert, telling him - \nMUM (CONT'D) Go back to the house. \nAs Albert leaves, Ted takes out his flask. But Rosie takes it from him gently. He doesn't resist. \nMRS. NARRACOTT Here, here. Some days are best forgotten. Today ain't one of them. Come on. \nThey exit the stable together, leaving Joey in his stall. \nINT./ EXT. STABLES. DAWN. Albert walks towards the stables - enters. And talks to Joey as he prepares the harness. \nALBERT How are you today, Joey? I don't know much about life, boy, but I do know that there are big days and there are small days. And most days are small days, and, well, they don't matter much to anyone - but this - well, this is a big one. This is our big day. Well, it's cold out there. So I'm going to take this off - (he takes off his coat) Well, if it's tough for you - it should be tough for me, too... \nHe is left in just a loose-fitting white shirt.... \nALBERT (CONT'D) Now, I'm gonna teach you how to plow and you're gonna learn. Is that understood? And then we can be together, which is how I believe things are meant to be. \nJoey instinctively balks, but Albert is stern with him. \nALBERT (CONT'D) Boy. Steady, boy. Here we go. Here we go. \nAs he approaches Joey with the harness, Harold the goose enters the stable to watch. Albert approaches gently and slowly puts the harness over his own neck and shoulders to demonstrate - \nALBERT (CONT'D) Easy, easy... Look at me, Joey. See? See? You've just gotta put your nose through. \nIt is a moment between them. The horse looks Albert in the eye, then yields. Albert comforts him and show there is nothing to fear. Finally he gets the harness in place. \nALBERT (CONT'D) That's it. See? You've got it. You've got it. Good boy. There... \nHarold honks his approval. \nAlbert leads Joey out across the yard, through the broken gate. \nEXT. LOWER FIELD. THE SAME. \nIt is a grey day as they walk across the plowed fields towards the huge lower field. They come to a rusty, primitive plow left in the grass. Albert looks around the field - it is overgrown, it seems to go on forever - even if Joey was a plow horse this would be a heavy task. \nSi Easton and Andrew stroll up the road to watch. \nThe plow skips and Albert falls. Joey's legs buckle and he goes to his knees. Albert rushes to his side. \nALBERT (CONT'D) Whoa. Whoa. Lyons calls from the crowd as rain starts to fall. \nLYONS You've got no chance, lad. He'll not turn over half an acre. Give it up now. You've done well. You've tried hard. You're more of a man than your father. \nAlbert examines the collar - he sees it is ripping into Joey's flesh. He grabs his shirt, tears a piece off it, tenderly folds it and puts it between Joey's shoulder and the collar. \nSI EASTON Come on now, Mr. Lyons, that's a bit rough, isn't it? LYONS (A SHRUG:) Well, he'll destroy that horse. \nThe crowd's beginning to disperse. One of Lyons' cronies holds his umbrella as he returns to his car. He passes Ted. \nLYONS (CONT'D) I'll be over Thursday. Give you a day to close it up. \nMrs. Narracott emerges from the house and heads to the fence - holding her knitting in the rain, ignoring the leaving crowds. A SYMPATHETIC NEIGHBOR hands her: \nNEIGHBOUR Your wool. (THEN) I'm sorry, Rosie. \nLyons passes behind her, almost speaks, but then thinks better of it. \nAs the rain intensifies, Albert digs his toe into the wet soil and notices how it has softened. Suddenly something flashes through Albert's mind. He leaps into action, runs through the rain to shout at Joey. \nALBERT Now, boy! You've got to do it, Joey. You don't know, so I'm gonna have to do the knowing for you when the rest of our lives depend on this! So get set to pull - and pull straight! And pull hard! \nHe races back to the plow and sets himself. \nALBERT (CONT'D) Now, boy! Go! \nJoey pulls firmly and finally the inertia is broken - the rain has softened the earth. \nALBERT (CONT'D) Walk on, Joey! Walk on! That's it! Good boy, Joey! Good boy! \nFinally, the plow bites deep into the soil. \nANDREW Walk on! Walk on! Walk on! Walk on, Joey! \nAt the fence, Mrs. Narracott looks on in amazement. \nAlbert notices a large rock in their path. Andrew sees it, too. \nANDREW (CONT'D) (YELLING) Go around it!! \nALBERT Whoa, Joey! Whoa, Joey! Joey! Joey, whoa whoa whoa! Joey, stop! You'll break the blade - \nAlbert hauls back on the reins, but Joey throws his flanks forward, straining and lurching until the plow blade splits the rock completely in half and now the plow moves more easily through the wet ground. \nThe ground yields. Soon Albert and Joey are making great progress. The wet earth slipping open beneath them. \nAndrew is loving it, speaks in wonder. \nANDREW Will you look at you? \nMrs. Narracott looks very happy, a smile breaking slowly across her face... \nThe crowd begins to return. Lyons notices and looks out from his car - sees the plow digging through the field. Annoyed at the progress Albert's making, he gets out of his car and walks over to Mrs. Narracott. With great disdain he SAYS: \nLYONS I'd not let a child of mine slip in the mud alongside a plow blade. He could lose a foot! \nMrs. Narracott brandishes her knitting needles, backing him up. \nROSIE NARRACOTT You'll likelier lose an eye, Mr. Lyons, if you carry on prating at me how to manage my son! Or my plow, or my horse, or my field, or my farm! Dad sits nearby, watching this exchange with silent approval. Lyons stares at her, gape-mouthed, as she turns her attention back to Albert. \nMRS. NARRACOTT Come on, Albie! Push on through! \nThe rain becomes torrential. Lyons turns towards the car - gestures, frustrated, to his driver, who runs forward with the umbrella to shield his boss from the rain. David remains on the running board, watching Albert plowing. \nThe plow speeds through the earth. The boy and the horse are working as one. It is a moment of triumph. \nANDREW Get it done, Albie! Get it done! \nWe pull back to see they have made only the smallest dent in the enormous field. \nAs Lyons' car passes, Dad steps forward, takes in the scene, and almost smiles. \nALBERT (CONT'D) I'm not stealing it. I'll give it back to him, someday. \nEXT. FIELD. DAY. \nEarly morning. Dad hobbling across the furrows, alone, planting the field by hand. \nEXT. NARRACOTT FARM. DEVON COUNTRY MONTAGE. Albert and Joey are now in a meadow. They trot past the field he plowed, now packed with a strong and sturdy crop, which Ted tends to. \nThe sun is breaking through and Joey starts to run across the field and up a small incline. As both Joey and Albert gain confidence they pick up speed. Albert pushes Joey on, they are going faster and faster, Albert yells with the exhilaration of it all. Joey races flat out across the countryside. Albert hanging on for dear life. \nAlbert and Joey pull up beside a sleek red car. It's Lyons' car, being driven by David Lyons, every inch the expensively- tailored rural gentry. \nDAVID Um, I'm the only boy that drives in the village. No one else drives but me. \nYOUNG WOMAN Oh, yeah? \nDAVID That's right and this is my dad's car. You're lucky that you're in it. I'm not normally allowed to drive it `cause it's so - \nAlbert urges Joey to go faster, till they're neck and neck beside the car, racing it. David Lyons looks to see Albert and Joey running alongside his car. He feigns disinterest. Albert glances at David, but he's much more interested in the very pretty young woman seated next to David, her hands trying to control her hair, flying in the wind. Forgetting himself momentarily, Albert stares at her, dazzled. The woman turns to David: \nYOUNG WOMAN Is he a friend of yours? \nShe smiles at Albert, encouraging him. David Lyons, annoyed, pushes the accelerator down, and the car edges ahead of Joey. \nBut not for long. The sound of the acceleration and Albert's eagerness to impress the young woman make Joey go faster, and again he moves out ahead of the car. The young woman grins at Albert. \nUp ahead Albert sees that the wall alongside of which he's been racing turns the corner, presenting him and Joey with an obstacle. Albert encourages Joey to go faster. \nALBERT Come on, boy, let's show her how to fly! \nThey head right for the wall, but at the very last moment, Joey balks and comes to a dead standstill, sending Albert sailing over the wall. \nBack in the car, the girl gasps and covers her mouth, concerned. David says nothing, but allows himself a small smile. \nOn the other side of the wall, Albert stands a bit battered, but unfazed. \nALBERT (CONT'D) Well...you're clearly not gonna be a jumper. \nThunder starts to rumble ominously in the background. \nEXT. NARRACOTT FARM. NIGHT. \nAlbert and Joey return, driving sheep before them. Angry storm clouds stretch to the horizon. \nEXT. NARRACOTT FARM. NIGHT. \nAs Albert leads Joey to the stable, lighting blasts across an angry sky. The rain is falling in torrents. \nINT. FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. Another crack of thunder - and a piece of wood in the roof gives way - water gushes in - Dad rushes to support the roof as the wind forces a window open. \nAt that moment, the door suddenly swings open with the violence of the storm, smashing against the wall - Dad and Rosie turn - and there is Harold the goose, who scuttles in without his usual arrogance and hides himself in a corner. \nMRS. NARRACOTT Shoo, Harold. Shoo, shoo, shoo! \nThe thunder cracks again and... \nEXT. LOWER FIELD. DAY. \nAlbert and Dad walk across the field. Mrs. Narracott digs through the mess. The entire crop is flat - ruined by the storms. The ground squelches beneath their feet. The whole field is a write off. \nALBERT We can try planting something else, or we could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob. \nDad doesn't answer. He shakes his head and limps away. \nALBERT (CONT'D) How else we gonna pay Mr. Lyons' rent? \nTed doesn't turn around. \nINT. KITCHEN. EVENING. \nMrs. Narracott makes some coffee. Ted sits alone on a chair. \nMRS. NARRACOTT What we gonna do? \nAlbert bursts into the square just in time to see Nicholls and Dad shake hands. Their business concluded. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS Thank you. \nAlbert races towards Joey. Ted grabs him. Albert fights to get free. He looks at his father in anger and betrayal. \nALBERT You can't! You can't, he's mine! I trained him! \nDAD Albert. \nAlbert is hysterical. \nALBERT You can't have him. He's my horse, sir. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS I'm afraid it's too late, lad. I've just paid thirty guineas for him. \nALBERT (TO TED:) Please, I'll get you money. I will, I'll get you money. I'll...I'll work for it! I'll work for it. (TO NICHOLLS:) He won't obey anyone else. He won't be any good in the war, neither. He...he shies at every sound! \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS I'm sorry. \nAlbert snaps to attention. \nALBERT Well, if Joey's going, I'm going, too. I'm volunteering. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS I see. What's your name, lad? \nALBERT Albert, sir. CAPTAIN NICHOLLS And how old are you, Albert? \nALBERT Nineteen, sir. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLS Is that the truth? \nALBERT No sir. But, but I look nineteen and I'm bigger than most nineteen-year- olds, sir! And I'm strong, sir! And I...I'm not afraid of anything. \nNICHOLLS INTERJECTS: \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS I don't doubt your qualifications, Albert, but the law is very clear about the proper age for soldiering, and your father's done what he had to do. You know that. Thirty guineas isn't nearly enough to purchase a horse as fine as your Joey, I know that. But it's all I've got. Will you lease him to me, Albert, to be my own mount? (he removes his cap, EARNEST) I promise you, man to man, that I'll look after him as closely as you've done, I'll respect him and all the care that you've taken with him. And if I can - I'll return him to your care. \nAlbert looks at him. Although Nicholls speaks with authority he has a kindness which Albert recognizes. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D) Now say goodbye. \nAlbert kisses Joey. \nALBERT It's all right, boy... \nBut at that moment, Sam Perkins pulls Joey away: \nSAM PERKINS All right, turn it in, eh? That's enough. He's a horse, not a dog. Now, on your way. (TO JOEY) Come on. \nNicholls walks away into the crowd. The Sergeant pulls Joey, but Joey does not want to be separated from Albert. His reaction is implacable, reminiscent to the separation from his mother. Perkins leads Joey away. They disappear into the crowd and Rosie is suddenly there. Ted senses her silent judgment. \nDAD Do you want to lose the farm, Rose? \nROSIE It's the way you did it. \nDAD But we're at war. \nROSIE Aren't we just. \nShe looks at Albert. Implacable. Forever. \nEXT. VILLAGE SQUARE. THE SAME. \nThe recruits march through town under pennants and the strains of a familiar song(\"The Jolly Plowboy\") - it is a song they all know, which means a lot to them - full of soul - a song of harvest or a Celtic hymn, something relating specifically to the lives they have led together. Everyone of every age - everyone in the village knows this song - it is theirs. \nNicholls passes in his car and we see those they are leaving behind - cheering - a whole generation of young men is marching off to war. One girlfriend rushes up to kiss her leaving boyfriend. \nAlbert watches Joey, then remembers the campaign pennant dangling from his pocket. He runs up to Joey - \nALBERT Joey... \n- and tucks the pennant into Joey's halter. \nCaptain Nicholls, resplendent in full uniform rides Joey out over the vast expanse of the plain. Both Nicholls and Joey are dressed up like something from the last century, out of the Boer War, even the Charge of the Light Brigade. Nicholls is proud and confident. They gather before hundreds of men and horses all lined up to be inspected. Charlie joins them, looking pretty good on Blenheim. Finally, Nicholls and Charlie reach Stewart and Topthorn waiting in position. \nMAJOR STEWART Thought you two had bottled out. \nCHARLIE WAVERLY As if. \nNicholls looks at his friend tolerantly. \nMAJOR STEWART All right, then, let's see what you two jokers are made of, shall we? \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS This is what quiet confidence looks like. \nCHARLIE WAVERLY I'll wait for you two at the Duke of York. \nNicholls and Stewart and Charlie prepare themselves for the charge. Joey and Topthorn size up to one another. \nMAJOR STEWART Over to you, Captain Nicholls. \nTopthorn bristles at Joey. Everyone is highly charged. The competition between Stewart and Nicholls seems to have been absorbed between the horses. Topthorn and Joey square up for the practice charge like two athletes before a race. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS Draw...swords! \nNicholls raises his sword. It glints in the summer air. It seems to hang there forever. Every man follows suit. \nTopthorn and Joey glance at each other, ready to charge. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D) Give...point! \nEvery sword is pointed directly ahead at arm's length. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D) Charge!!!! \nA roar goes up from the men and a deafening pounding of hooves breaks the silence. The huge line of horses start running straight ahead of them. Joey and Topthorn run off at top speed. Dust and earth rise up behind them. Bugles, the deafening thunder of hooves. It is exhilarating. We see the scale of the operation, we enjoy the speed and the splendor of the mass of men and horses. The soldiers shout in glee and excitement. Each man pushes his horse to out-run those around him, Nicholls and Stewart seem locked in mortal combat. \nNicholls smiles at Stewart, confidently. \nTopthorn starts to pull away, ahead of all the other horses in the line. Nicholls pushes Joey on. Topthorn seems too strong, Joey will never catch them. Nicholls is determined not to be beaten. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D) Come on, Joey. I know you've got it. Come on, boy! Come on! \nHe pushes Joey on. Joey digs in and finds hidden strength and speed. He starts to catch up with Topthorn and draws along side. Nicholls and Stewart exchange tense looks. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D) Come on, boy! \nStewart is amazed and pushes Topthorn harder. \nNow both riders are going at their top speed. They are neck and neck - they fight for every inch of advantage, every fibre of their being invested in the race. Nicholls pushes Joey on and Joey pulls away. Joey inches forward till he is almost a length ahead of Topthorn. The effort is enormous. Nicholls looks back at Stewart, very happy. Stewart's frustration shows. He knows he is beaten. \nThen suddenly they race over the line. Nicholls spears a ring decorated with a blue ribbon and pulls Joey to a halt. They have crossed the enemy line. Nicholls is ecstatic. Topthorn comes to Joey's side. \nMAJOR STEWART Whoa. Whoa. \nNicholls laughs, grinning. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS Nice of you to turn up. \nThe horses are nose to nose, snorting, we sense the heat, the exertion. Topthorn and Joey are brought together by the effort. We sense Topthorn's newly minted respect for Joey. And Joey is no soft touch - he slightly holds his head up in victory, letting Topthorn know that he knows he won. \nThe other horses come charging in. There is a real sense of achievement and congratulation amongst the regiment. \nMAJOR STEWART He's got speed...I'll give him that. But has he got stamina? \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS He has everything. \nThe two men enjoy the moment of rivalry and the exhilaration of it all. The two horses, face to face rub against each other for the first time. A bond has been formed... \nINT. OFFICERS' STUDY. DAY. \nStewart enters. A phonograph plays \"Roses of Picardy.\" The walls are decorated with etchings of famous battles, and a large map of Western Europe that depicts how the English troops are crossing the channel to confront the Germans near Belgium. Nicholls is writing a letter - though actually at this moment, he is making a little pencil drawing of Joey to enclose with it. \nMAJOR STEWART What are you up to? \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS I'm writing a letter. \nSGT. MAJOR SINGH The grass to the left is taller than we are - it's perfect cover. \nMAJOR STEWART Excellent work, Sergeant Major. Time spent on reconnaissance is rarely wasted. \nAs Stewart departs: \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS Thank you, Singh. (CALLING AFTER) Jamie! \nNicholls catches up to Stewart, concerned. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D) They have no idea we're coming. \nMAJOR STEWART Not having scruples, are you, Jim? \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS No. I understand the surprise is everything. But if it must be done, let's do it quickly. \nNicholls notices Charlie nervously attending his horse. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS (CONT'D) Are you alright, Charlie? \nCHARLIE WAVERLY Never been better. Literally, never better. \nWe worry for him - he is afraid. \nStewart rides through the lines astride Topthorn. \nMAJOR STEWART Prepare to mount! Mount! \nAs the cry is echoed throughout the regiment, Nicholls accepts Joey from an attending soldier. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS Thank you, Standley. (TO JOEY) Hey, Joey. My bonny boy. You're all right, aren't you, Joey? Hey? \nNicholls takes the red campaign pennant from his pocket and threads it through Joey's reins. \nMinutes later - Stewart addresses the men. \nMAJOR STEWART Gentleman. It is an honour to ride beside you. Make the Kaiser rue the day he dared to cross swords with us. Let every man make himself, his King, his country, and his fallen comrades proud! Be brave. Fear God. Honor the King! \nTROOPERS (in unison shout) Fear God. Honor the King! \nEXT. OVER GROWN CORN FIELD. DAY. \nCut to an elegant field of tall grass, waving in the gentle breeze. Then suddenly three hundred men seem to rise out of it. They are in fact our soldiers, mounting their horses - but the horses are invisible in the height of the grass. \nStewart gives a signal. We see the intense anticipation on his face. He takes out his sabre. \nMAJOR STEWART Draw swords! The men draw their sabres in silence. The birds chirping, oblivious. \nThen Nicholls just turns to his two friends and almost whispers... \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS Good luck, my friends. \nHe pats Joey's side. And then... \nMAJOR STEWART Forward, to walk! Walk...march! \nThe regiment begins moving through the field. \nMAJOR STEWART (CONT'D) Forward to canter! Canter...march! \nThe men start to float over the grass - swept along by their invisible horses, until... \nSuddenly they emerge from the tall grass - the immense power of the galloping horses - silence explodes into a violent crashing of hooves. The noise is immense, swords are flying in the air. Hundreds of horses racing towards the German encampment. \nOn the German side, TWO SOLDIERS wake to the sound of hoofbeats. They pull their tent flap aside to find the invincible charge coming towards them. The Germans are totally unprepared. We see them scramble back towards tents, rush towards their guns - one man pulling up his trousers rushes for cover. One German drops some dirty dishes into a wash pot, screaming: \nGERMAN SOLDIER Kavallerie! \nTopthorn and Joey race each other like a rerun of their practice on Salisbury Plain. The swords and uniforms glint in the sun, the German troops look terrified - some run in panic, others prepare to stand their ground. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS CHARGE! \nThe British head in for the kill, the men scream battle cries with sheer exhilaration. \nMICHAEL Gunther! It's hopeless - we can't help them. \nAnd suddenly Joey moves up and presents himself, with his strange self assurance and self sacrifice. And instinct for survival. \nHe sniffs the harness and places his head through it, which helps to calm Topthorn enough that Gunther can slip the collar onto the big black horse. Gunther turns to Joey, impressed. \nGUNTHER Well, well, look at you. Whoever taught you this has just saved your life. \nGunther spots the red ribbon in Joey's saddle, removes it, folds it, and places it in his pocket. \nLater - Gunther and Michael are returning from the battlefield with Topthorn and Joey, pulling an ambulance with British and German wounded. Amongst the wounded, we see a hand gripping a battered, silk lined hat. It is Waverly, wounded but alive. \nEXT. NARRACOTT'S FARM. DEVON. DAY. \nSi Easton lets himself in through the gate. Ted pulls up turnips from their three acre crop. \nRosie, just across a furrow, is also engaged in the harvest. It's hard work. Si holds a parcel. \nSI EASTON Hello the farm! \nROSIE (looking up, wiping her BROW) Hello, Si Easton! \nAlbert passes carrying a crate laden with turnips, but pulls up short when he hears: \nSI EASTON I was at the post office and while I was there, Mrs. Allen said a parcel had come for Albert, from the, from the, from over there - and I thought I could go up that way in the morning. And - here it is. \nALBERT Well, who'd be sending me a parcel over there? \nDAD Well, open it and see. \nAlbert opens the parcel and pulls out a leather sketchbook... \nALBERT It's a sketchbook... (gasp of realization) That's Captain Nicholls' sketchbook! See that? That's a picture of Joey! ROSIE It's a picture of Joey. Well, I never! \nALBERT (EXCITED) And there's a letter... \nROSIE Well, go on then, go on. \nALBERT All right. (READING) \"Dear Albert Narracott. (MORE) ALBERT (CONT'D) Captain Nicholls, who died...Captain Nicholls, who died in action today left you this. Yours, Sergeant Sam Perkins. \nSi Easton drops his head guiltily. Rosie catches this. \nROSIE You weren't to know it was bad news. \nALBERT He was riding Joey when he died. \nROSIE You don't know that he was riding him... \nALBERT \"In action,\" it says. \nEverybody falls silent. Albert goes to the fence and looks down at the sketches of Joey. Rosie looks at her son, her heart breaking for him. Dad returns to the harvest without a word. Albert looks off to the horizon and - over there. \nEXT. GERMAN BASE CAMP. EVENING. \nCLOSE -- A step stool. \nMichael mounts the stool next to Joey and Topthorn, removes their harnesses and carries them across the road. \nMichael slips and falls into the mud. Gunther dashes over and pulls him up just before a military convoy pulls into the camp, running over the tack. \nThe BASE CAMP OFFICER appears on a motorbike. BASE CAMP OFFICER. Gentlemen! We move forward to the frontline tonight. Full marching orders. Get moving! \nAs the soldiers hop to their orders, the officer turns to - \nBASE CAMP OFFICER Schroeder! Schroeder! \nBoth Michael and Gunther turn to him. But it's Gunther the Officer wants to talk to. \nBASE CAMP OFFICER (CONT'D) No, not you - you. Come. \nGunther picks up the dropped harnesses as he approaches. \nBASE CAMP OFFICER (CONT'D) I'm keeping you here. You are best with the horses and we need to move the camp quickly if the enemy continue to push through from the west. \nThey spot a lonely house and burst past a line with some drying clothes. \nAs they ride, they grab civilian shirts and jackets and trousers, the clothes pegs pinging off and falling to the ground. \nAnd on they ride - though all too soon day starts to break in the far distance. They see a very dilapidated windmill. They aim for it as the sun begins to seriously break over the horizon. \nINT. / EXT. WINDMILL. DAWN. \nThey reach the windmill. It feels very unused. The machinery of the windmill creaks in the dawn. The brothers untether the horses, careful now that it is light outside. \nMICHAEL I'm hungry. Did you bring food? GUNTHER I'm sorry. \nMichael fingers the pennant on Joey's reins. Then... \nMICHAEL Will Father be ashamed? \nGUNTHER He will pretend to be. Maybe at first he will be. But in the end, he will be glad. \nMICHAEL And us? What about us? \nGunther looks at him - but doesn't reply. As Michael removes JOEY'S SADDLE: MICHAEL (CONT'D) I was ready to go. I was proud to go. (after a beat, in a very SMALL VOICE) I wanted to go. \nLater - They sit in silence, waiting for sleep. \nMICHAEL (CONT'D) The food in Italy is good. \nGUNTHER Yes. \nMICHAEL What about the women? \nGUNTHER Not as good as the food. \nMICHAEL Because...they've eaten too much of the food? \nGUNTHER You are too young for war. And you're too young for women! \nGunther laughingly pushes him over. \nMICHAEL I don't feel so young. Not anymore. \nMICHAEL (CONT'D) Michael. MICHAEL (CONT'D) What? \nGUNTHER Go to sleep - we have a big night of riding ahead. Goodnight, Michael. \nHe jokingly strokes Michael's cheek. Michael swats him away, but as he settles in the hay: \nMICHAEL Night night, Gunther. \nEXT. WINDMILL. DUSK. \nGunther and Michael sleep. Suddenly something awakens Joey. He stirs and then rises. Hear the sound of engines and see lights through the slats sweeping across Joey's face. Michael and Gunther are stirring in their sleep as we hear a car and several motorcycles approaching. Head-lamps filter through the cracks in the windmill walls stabbing the brothers awake. \nGERMAN SOLDIER Hei! In die windm\u00fchle! \nThe boys spring up, speaking in terrified whispers. \nGUNTHER Go, go, go... \nMICHAEL Okay. \nThey race up a nearby ladder, but Michael stumbles against a table, upsetting some gear. It clatters loudly. They cower as they hear boots tromping up the steps outside. Then the windmill doors are thrown open, pinning them in the bright headlights of the vehicles. \nAs they're marched out, we see what they see: A German car - two motorcycles. Six Germans, including the officer who was in charge of them. \nBASE CAMP OFFICER Schroeder. \nGUNTHER Yes, sir. \nBASE CAMP OFFICER A mistake? He's offering an excuse, but - \nGUNTHER A promise. \nThe officer accepts this grimly, nods. \nGRANDFATHER They must belong to someone. Horses like this don't just appear from a fairy-tale. \nEMILIE Yes - I know, Grandp\u00e9re. They are not unicorns - so I will be fair and wait -- one day. \nGRANDFATHER Emilie... Emilie... \nEMILIE And if no one comes to get them by night-time, then they belong to me. \nGRANDFATHER Emilie. Look at me. You cannot ride. \nEMILIE Mother used to tell me how my bones would give way with the slightest bump or fall. \nGRANDFATHER Yes. That's right. So it is settled? She kisses his cheek -- \nGRANDFATHER (CONT'D) Good girl. \n-- but then calmly leads the horses back to the windmill. \nEMILIE It will only be settled when I decide which one to ride first. \nGRANDFATHER But it's - Over my dead body! \nEMILIE At least I won't have long to wait. \nThat is the end of the conversation as far as she is concerned. \nEXT. FARM HOUSE. DAY. \nEmilie is with the horses in the little stable at the end of the courtyard - a bit away from the farm house - she is feeding them out of a bucket - not very nice gruel.... WE SEE THAT SHE IS HESITANT WITH THEM - that she has spent no time around horses. \nEMILIE (TO JOEY) I was in love with a boy called Fran\u00e7ois - who had your lovely eyes. (TO CLAUDE) Unfortunately he was in love with a girl called Marie, who had your teeth. She fell for a boy called Claude - who broke my heart. And who I intend to marry one day. \nINT./EXT. FIELD IN FRONT OF FARMHOUSE. DAY. \nGrandfather watches Emilie from inside the house as he makes jam. \nEMILIE (O.S.) Eyes on me. No talking. \nOutside, Emilie has fashioned two jumps. The big one for Joey and a little demonstration obstacle for herself. She leads Joey to a starting point about 30 yards in front of some crates supporting a stick about four feet off the ground. The red pennant hangs from the stick. Joey stands quietly as Emilie hobbles to the big jump, making a jumping gesture with her hand. EMILIE (CONT'D) Today we learn to jump. Did you know the French cleared one meter eighty- five at the Paris Olympics to win the gold medal? Today we will beat that record. \nGrandfather chuckles. Emilie indicates the larger barrier. \nEMILIE (CONT'D) This is your jump. When I call you....be very brave and leap over it. \nShe claps, but Joey doesn't move. \nEMILIE (CONT'D) Leap over it! Watch me. \nShe turns to her demonstration jump and easily steps over her six-inch high barrier. \nEMILIE (CONT'D) And now it's your -- \nShe turns to find Joey already stepping over her mini-jump, stopping in front of her. He's only interested in the apple in her hand. She takes a bite herself. \nJUMP TO: \nEmilie returns Joey to the starting line and runs back behind the big jump. From behind her back she produces three big carrots dripping soil. Joey's ears perk and he takes off quickly but at the last moment veers right and passes between the two jumps. \nINT. FARMHOUSE. DAY. \nGrandfather is watching through the window as he prepares his strawberry jams. He laughs and goes back to work. \nBACK TO FIELD \nAware she's being watched, she slings the carrots over her shoulder, frustrated. \nJUMP TO: \nEXT. BARN. LATER. \nJoey slowly emerges from the barn with Emilie out in front leading him with one hand. In the other hand, she carries a small wooden step ladder. \nEMILIE He doesn't think we can do it. But we will show him, won't we? \nBRANDT - or until the war is over. \nGRANDFATHER It will never be over! \nBRANDT You have your answer then. \nThe motorbikes start up and drive off. The Grandfather hugging tiny Emilie as she coughs. \nThe Germans disappear up the lane leaving the old man and the child bereft in the bitter cold. \nEXT. GERMAN CAMP. LATER. \nTwo grooms trail Brandt, leading Joey and Topthorn toward a makeshift corral. \nBRANDT Heiglemann - these are yours. \nFRIEDRICH Yes, sir. \nBRANDT They look strong - should last a month or two. FRIEDRICH is an unprepossessing, chubby man. He marvels at Topthorn. \nFRIEDRICH You are beautiful. \nBut then he looks to the other horses penned nearby, haggard and weak. He turns to Joey. \nFRIEDRICH (CONT'D) It's a pity they found you. \nHe takes the leads of the pair of them. He sighs... \nFRIEDRICH (CONT'D) Such a pity... \nIn a strange way, there are many humans Joey meets, but also just one, the spirit of goodness and consideration for animals, joined by little echoes throughout the film. \nAnd then they go over a ridge - and we suddenly see the explanation of Friedrich's comment. The road they can see below them is the main through road of the area - and it is a scene of horse horror - huge, massive guns and cannons and artillery being dragged by teams of horses that are in a terrible condition. \nFor Joey and Topthorn, this is a moment like when soldiers arrived to liberate the prisoners who had been kept in Changi prison by the Japanese during World War 2. They have never seen horses in this condition. You can see in their eyes the confusion. This is a whole different world, where horses can turn into creatures that look like this. \nAnd it is also a vision of their future. This may be the moment the mighty Topthorn begins to lose hope. For Joey it is another level of knowledge - another mighty thing he will fight through - because he always fights through. \nEXT. STEEP INCLINE. DAY. \nFriedrich leads Joey and Topthorn in the wake of THE HUGE MORSER - an elaborate 15 ton monstrosity with a six inch bore. It takes a team of six horses to haul it with a dozen men pushing from behind. \nARTILLERY OFFICER Pull together! \nA soldier calls from the front of the heavy cannon - pulled by a particularly wretched group of horses. ARTILLERY SOLDIER Halt! Halt! Stop! \nLower down the hill, Friedrich waves down the rest of the column. \nFRIEDRICH Stop! Stop! \nAt the front of the Morser, one of the lead horses collapses - he will never get up again. \nBrandt steps up, pulls a revolver out of his pocket and shoots the horse dead. It has come to this. \nJoey, Topthorn, and all the other horses are spooked by the pistol shot. \nBrandt shouts to Friedrich from the road. BRANDT Heiglemann, bring up another one! \nARTILLERY OFFICER Heiglemann, bring up another horse! \nBRANDT That one! \nFriedrich begins leading Joey up the hill, but -- \nBRANDT (CONT'D) No, no. The big black one! \nFriedrich hauls Topthorn, hesitantly, while Joey watches. \nAs he reaches Brandt: \nFRIEDRICH He's a good horse, sir. But if you move him up to the heavy gun, he will be no use at all. Prince is already losing condition. His leg, sir. \nBRANDT You have given them names? \nIt is David - Lyon's son - now in charge of this small group of men. Still arrogant - looking older than Albert in his uniform - and clearly enjoying his superior rank. \nDAVID I hear you and your mate were doing bird imitations again. You gonna write a letter to your horse? \nAlbert ignores him. Andrew can't help but giggle. DAVID (CONT'D) After you find your horse, I've lost my needle in a haystack, and I could use some help. \nDavid takes up a bucket and walks down the line of soldiers. \nDAVID (CONT'D) Anything valuable. Anyone who comes back gets to share it out. \nALBERT (TO ANDREW) Stay here. \nAlbert follows David down the trench. \nALBERT (CONT'D) Remember that day me and Joey raced you in your car? \nDAVID I remember you somersaulting through the air. \nALBERT Who was that girl you were with? \nDAVID There was a girl? \nAlbert nods. \nALBERT There was. Don't you remember? \nDAVID It was just some girl, I suppose. I don't recall which one. I do remember you falling on your bum in a ditch. \nAndrew laughs amiably. David points to him, smirking. \nDAVID (CONT'D) You see? Always entertaining, Narracott, I'll give you that. \nAs David walks on, Andrew smiles at Albert. \nANDREW You did that? You fell on your bum? \nAlbert leaves without answering. Andrew keeps smiling until a large shell explodes nearby. Troops surge towards their ladders as officers scream indistinct orders. \nNow David leads his troop through the trenches to the front line where they stop, lean against the enemy-side wall nervously and wait - each man in private contemplation. \nSergeant Martin moves along the lines, pushing men forward. \nSERGEANT MARTIN Be ready! Be ready! Let's go, men, get ready to go! Get ready to move out! Stay in position! \nDavid calls out from atop a trench ladder. \nDAVID Hold your nerve, boys. Remember, it's not far to go. There's a way through. (he moves down the line) Run fast, keep your wits about you, keep your eyes open and God and the King will keep an eye on you. Company will fix bayonets! Fix bayonets! \nThe echo of `fix bayonets' goes down the line - and every man fixes the brutal shining bayonet to the end of his gun. \nThen Albert turns to Andrew. \nALBERT You know what it reminds me of out there? \nANDREW What? \nALBERT That bloody impossible lower field the day me and Joey plowed it. Best day of my life that was and you were there. \nANDREW And this here is the worst day of my life, about to begin, and you're here cheering me on. Us two, always. And him. \nHe nods at David Lyons, who gives instructions to another soldier. DAVID Once you're in no man's land, go to the flanks. Stay on the flanks. \nSOLDIER Yes, sir. \nDavid turns to Albert and Andrew. \nDAVID Come on, boys, come on. To the ladder! \nALBERT (TO ANDREW) Stick close to the gentry, that's our ticket, yeah? We have the pluck but they have the luck. They both smile. And then the fear takes over again. Andrew particularly feels as though he is on the very edge now. David urges them forward. \nDAVID You, too, Narracott. (TO ANDREW) And you, too. \nAndrew and Albert pass by the bucket. They throw some valuables in. But a moment later, Albert goes back to the bucket and pulls something out - a worn piece of paper - he unfolds it - it is the little sketch that Captain Nicholls drew of Joey the night before they left for France. He slips it inside his shirt, next to his heart. \nAlbert pauses just in time. Then he collapses against the side of the trench, overwhelmed. \nANDREW (CONT'D) Albie. \nAndrew grabs Albert and holds him up, embracing him. Albert can barely whisper: \nALBERT We made it. We made it. \nA moment later, the pair of them hurry through the trenches. Albert spots more comrades around a corner and calls ahead to Andrew. \nALBERT (CONT'D) Andrew, this way out! Suddenly ANOTHER SOLDIER leaps from a trench branch between them, shouting in panic. \nSOLDIER Gas! Gas! Gas! \nAn instant later, a gas cloud blasts through the trench. Andrew and Albert look in horror. It spreads towards them, too powerful to avoid. Andrew is closest, turns to Albert with a helpless - \nANDREW Albie... \n- before he takes the full power of it. An instant later, the white, deadly cloud encompasses Albert, too... \nEXT. EDGE OF THE BATTLEFIELDS. DUSK. Close on hooves and boots, slogging through muddy water, several inches deep. \nFriedrich is walking along, leading Topthorn and Joey. Topthorn is limping. \nSomething is wrong - Topthorn seems to be failing - he coughs badly, breathes strangely. Friedrich stops to check on him. An officer notices. \nGERMAN OFFICER Hey, there's no stopping here. Keep them moving. \nFRIEDRICH Sir, there's something wrong. This one needs to rest. \nGERMAN OFFICER There's no rest for them. Move them along. Move them along! \nInstead, Friedrich leads the horses under the cover of a low bridge for a brief respite. A moment later, Topthorn collapses. \nFRIEDRICH Please, please, please. Stay on your feet. No, please. No no no... \nFriedrich tries to help Topthorn valiantly struggling to get up but finally sinks to the ground again. This time he lies semi-conscious. He is dying. \nFRIEDRICH (CONT'D) Please please... Stay on your feet. \nJoey deeply upset nuzzles his nose into Topthorn but the life drains out him. Friedrich is in panic at Topthorn's quick DECLINE: \nFRIEDRICH (CONT'D) Come on. Please please... \nFriedrich continues to stroke Topthorn's head. Joey pushes Topthorn as if to stop him falling into unconsciousness. For a moment we think Topthorn will come round but he slips away and all life leaves his body. Friedrich solemnly strokes the horse, knowing all is lost. \nJoey does not understand. He pulls at Topthorn's reins, as if trying to pull him upright. Topthorn's body is inert, his head falls to the earth. Joey will not give up, he pulls at him desperately not understanding that Topthorn has died. \nSuddenly, Friedrich looks around. Chaos - all the German soldiers stream back past their position, scrambling to get their guns and helmets. An officer charges down the bank next to the bridge, screaming orders at Friedrich. \nGERMAN OFFICER They're coming! Leave it, private! \nFriedrich tries to pull Joey away to safety but Joey will not leave Topthorn's body. Friedrich pulls at Joey, but Joey is too lost in his grief to care about or even notice the danger. \nGERMAN OFFICER (CONT'D) Leave it! Come with me! \nFRIEDRICH Go to hell! \nThe officer nods to two other soldiers who pull Friedrich to safety. As he's dragged away, he screams at Joey: \nFRIEDRICH (CONT'D) Run. Run! Run! Run! \nBut this is all background noise to Joey's profound refusal to accept Topthorn is dead. He paws at the ground next to Topthorn, a horse standing over his best friend in a field, and he will never leave him. \nAnd then suddenly - from around a blind turn in the streambed, a huge, remorseless tank turns, heading right for Joey. He bolts, galloping down the streambed, until he reaches a barbed wire barrier - a dead end. He attempts to run up the banks, but they're blocked, as well. He rears up, but the tank keeps advancing. \nThe tank is about to crush Joey. He has left it too late. He is about to die. \nBut then, counter-intuitively, he runs straight towards the tank and...leaps over it - a leap he learnt from Emilie. Then scrambles up and over it and leaps down behind. \nJoey keeps on running. He is wild, frightened. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE / VILLAGE / TRENCH. THE SAME. \nGEORDIE Yet we taught `em opposite. Running into the fray. \nPETER War horse. \nGEORDIE Yeah. War horse. And there he is. What a strange beast you've become. \nThe Geordie grabs hold of Joey's halter, though Joey shows no sign of running. \nJoey is finally free. \nThe two men look at each other. \nPETER And now? GEORDIE I take him back with me, yeah? \nPETER Since I supplied the cutters, the horse is mine. This is fair, no? \nGEORDIE In a pig's eye. He's English, plain to see. \nPETER Oh, you mean because he's so filthy? \nGEORDIE Because he's so smart. And you're none too clean yourself. \nPETER We could box. And the winner gets the horse. \nThe Geordie smiles. \nGEORDIE No, thanks, pet. Must be careful not to start a war. (patting his pockets:) Do you have a coin of any sort? \nPETER Coin toss? \nGEORDIE Yeah. He takes a coin from his pocket, hands it to the Geordie, who looks at it. \nGEORDIE (CONT'D) All right, Fritz - you're on. \nHe flips the coin back to Peter. \nPETER My name is not Fritz - it is Peter. \nGEORDIE Peter - I'm Colin. \nPETER You call it, Colin. \nGEORDIE Heads. Peter spins it in the air and lets it fall into the mud. They look down. Peter shakes his head, resigned. \nPETER That's the face of my Kaiser and he does not look pleased with me. The horse is yours. \nThey collect their helmets as snow begins to blow around them. \nGEORDIE Gone quiet, hasn't it? \nPETER Yes. (PAUSE) (MORE) PETER (CONT'D) But wait half an hour and we'll be shooting again. \nGEORDIE I'm a terrible shot, Pete, don't believe I'll ever hit the target. \nHe hands back the cutters. \nPETER Thanks. \nHe notices the Geordie has offered his hand, as well. A beat, then Peter shakes with him. \nPETER (CONT'D) Cheerio, mate. (RE JOEY:) You'll take good care of him, yes? \nGEORDIE I will. \nPETER Our strange beast. \nGEORDIE And you take care of your own strange self. \nPeter tosses Geordie his cutters. \nPETER Colin! A pair of German cutters - in memory of your handsome friend from Dusseldorf. \nGEORDIE Thanks. \nALBERT What kind of an horse? \nAN ORDERLY Bloody miraculous kind of an horse, be my guess. Nothing makes it out of No Man's Land. \nAlbert lies there, but can't let go of the thought: \nALBERT Miraculous horse... \nEXT. HOSPITAL AREA. SAME. \nJoey stands - breathing very deeply. The Doctor touches his wounded leg. \nThe men from all over the medical area gather around Joey concerned about their new hero's pain. \nThe doctor looks at the Geordie and frowns shaking his head \"no.\" \nGEORDIE (to the doctor:) He was alive, y'see, sir, where nothing survives, so to me and me mates, to the men, sir, he's - Well, we have high hopes for him - DOCTOR You should shoot him now. \nThe Geordie is broken hearted. \nGEORDIE Oh, but I can't. \nDOCTOR It'd be a mercy, lad, that leg's not going to mend. \nThe Doctor sadly addresses a nearby Sergeant. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) Sergeant. Put him out of his misery. \nThe doctor nods his head towards Joey. The sergeant, SERGEANT FRY, takes his gun from his holster, checks that it's loaded. He turns to some nearby NURSES, urging them away. \nSERGEANT FRY Ladies, if you please. \nTotal silence from the crowd who have gathered. They thought they were there to see something wonderful. And now they find that they've gathered for an execution - but can't take their eyes off it. The Sergeant waves them back. \nSERGEANT FRY (CONT'D) All right, back off. Back off. \nThe Geordie is the last to step away from Joey. The sergeant draws breath - before he steps forward to take aim. Joey is totally still, sensing the atmosphere. The sergeant cocks his pistol. \nSuddenly there is a strange owl like whistle from fifty yards away. Joey looks around startled. \nThe sergeant turns Joey's head back around, raises his pistol once more. \nThen, the whistle again. Even the doctor notices this time. \nJoey turns. Slowly, the crowd parts - another owl whistle - and we see Albert, his eyes bandaged - walking forward blindly - guided by the hands of the crowd. \nOne soldier urges Albert gently. \nSOLDIER Go on. Do it again. One more whistle. \nALBERT Joey? \nAnd this time, Joey trots over to Albert. The horse nuzzles into him. Albert can't see Joey but he touches him. \nALBERT (CONT'D) (SOFTLY:) Hello, Joey. Hello boy. Where you been then, hey? Where in the world you been? \nHe strokes Joey's mane. Joey responds, becoming very still. The Doctor approaches with the Geordie. \nDOCTOR (to the Geordie:) Do you know this man? \nThe Geordie shakes his head, no. The Doctor speaks to Albert, gently; clearly he thinks he's dealing with a traumatized, possibly crazy soldier. \nDOCTOR (CONT'D) What's your name? \nAlbert, realizing he's being addressed, turns to the doctor. \nALBERT Narracott, Private Albert Narracott, sir. \nDOCTOR This is a random horse, Narracott, and too badly injured. (to the orderly) Is this man in your care? \nAN ORDERLY Yes, sir. \nALBERT He's not random at all, sir! He's my horse, I raised him, in Devon. Sir, look at his legs! He's got four white socks, he's brown all over - (points to his own FOREHEAD) - and he has a white mark here - like so... \n", "test1_input": "GERMAN SOLDIER What is that? \nGRANDFATHER The wind. It plays tricks in the attic. \nBrandt licks his finger and tests: \nBRANDT There is no wind. \nGRANDFATHER An old house creaks. (TO EMILIE) Go - close the shutters. \nEmilie runs out of the room. The soldier picks up the medicine bottle. \nGERMAN SOLDIER She's sickly, no? GRANDFATHER If you or any of your friends harm her, as old as I am, I will kill you. \nThe soldier looks shocked and then begins to laugh. He slaps the medicine flask into Grandfather's chest. \nGERMAN SOLDIER You know, I was going to give you back your pot. But now I'm going to keep it. For soup. \nHe slings the huge pot he had put back up on his shoulder and leaves the house with the other soldiers. \nBRANDT We will be back in the new season. \nAs the Germans leave, we cut to the upstairs bedroom where Emilie lies curled up on the bed - and there, standing on either side of the bed - are the two horses. They look huge in the tiny room. \nINT. KITCHEN. LATE THAT NIGHT. \nThe sound of shells exploding. A huge bombardment somewhere in the deep distance. But much closer than before. The distant, malicious giants of war growl. \nIt is like a lightning storm on the horizon. \nThe kitchen has been emptied. The war has finally come to them - and we can see it on Emilie's face. EMILIE Tell me what happened to them. To my mother and father. \nGrandfather doesn't respond. \nEMILIE (CONT'D) You said you would tell me how they died. On my birthday. And tomorrow's my birthday! They died fighting, didn't they? But when the soldiers COME - \nShe finally turns to face him. \nEMILIE (CONT'D) - you do nothing. You are a coward, aren't you? GRANDFATHER Yes. Yes. It was your parents who were brave. I make jams. \nEMILIE And you've never done a brave thing in your life? \nHe eases himself into a chair and shrugs. \nGRANDFATHER Maybe there are different ways to be brave. Did you know the French have the best carrier pigeons? And this could be the difference in the war - our messages getting through. \nEMILIE I don't want to hear about the birds. \nGRANDFATHER They are released at the front and told to go home - this is all they know. But to get there they must fly over a war. Can you imagine such a thing? Here you are flying over so much pain and terror - and you know you can never look down. You have to look forward or you'll never get home. I ask you - what could be braver than that? \nEmilie sheds a single tear. INT. THE BARN. DAWN. \nGrandfather enters the barn, strokes Topthorn's nose as he passes. He sweeps aside a rug from the barn floor, to reveal a trap door. Then, he opens it. \nNow from out of the trap door, he lifts a big ungainly object, covered in another rug. \nINT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN. MORNING. \nEmilie comes down the stairs as Grandfather waits proudly by the stove. She stops when she sees the OBJECT COVERED BY THE RUG. \nEMILIE What is that? \nGRANDFATHER A present. \nEmilie moves toward the object that is covered. \nEMILIE I hope you have not bought me a disgusting dress that I then have to wear like last year. \nGRANDFATHER (LAUGHING) It was disgusting? \nEMILIE Yes. I looked like an ugly nun. \nThen she stops herself and turns to Grandfather with a parental rebuke. \n", "test1_true": "The grandfather smiles and gives Emily a hug. \nGRANDFATHER Anything you say, my sweet one. Anything-you-say! You are, of course, the boss. It's just an old thing I found - don't worry yourself - leave it, I'll put it back. He leaves the room. Now Emilie is alone and she can't help it when she brings her eyes back to the object covered by the rug. She looks back over her shoulder to make sure she's not being watched and then lifts one corner of the rug. Her face explodes with a gorgeous smile. She pulls off the rug that is covering the big thing and...it is a gorgeous old saddle. She runs her hand along the saddle -- can hardly believe it. \nINT. A HILL. JUST BEYOND THE FARMHOUSE. NEAR THE WINDMILL. DAY. \nGrandfather helps to swing Emilie up and into the saddle. All at once, the Grandfather's charity evaporates. \nGRANDFATHER It was your mother's. I hid it, so as not to encourage you. Emilie, I want you to ride very slowly, very carefully. And promise me you won't go far -- \nEMILIE Of course. Okay, I promise. \nGRANDFATHER To the top of the hill and straight back again. \nEMILIE I promise. \nEmilie unties her hair and tosses the red pennant to Grandfather, releasing her hair to spill down her back and shoulder. \nEMILIE (CONT'D) My hero. \nShe sets off on Joey - and quickly spurs him to a gallop. \nGRANDFATHER Slowly...slowly... \nShe rides - past the windmill - and then over the top of a nearby hill - she speeds over it and out of sight. \nBack to the hill - a sudden change of mood. An empty shot. No movement, no returning girl. \nGRANDFATHER (CONT'D) Emilie! \nCut again to the top of the hill, then back to the Grandfather, very worried. \nGRANDFATHER (CONT'D) Emilie! \nTopthorn suddenly rears up - and charges off following, sensing danger. Grandfather starts to run in the direction of the hill. \nTopthorn charging over the brow of the hill. \nThe Grandfather running - out of breath. \nHe hears an indistinct scream from Emilie! \nHe reaches the top of the hill - comes over the brow - and there is not the fallen body of Emilie, which he has been fearing, but a brutal line of German soldiers - and motorbikes. It is like a line of Indians in a Western - total, alien fear. \nAnd there amongst them is Emilie, astride a panicked Joey, surrounded by soldiers. Another one holds Topthorn, who bucks and rears, but to no avail. Grandfather starts down the hill towards his granddaughter. \nEXT. GERMAN COLUMN NEAR THE WINDMILL. THE SAME \nThe Germans are moving through the horses they have gathered. Emilie, unhorsed, tries to get to Joey, who is being roughly led away by a German soldier. \nEMILIE No! Let go of me! No! \nGrandfather grabs her. She is screaming. He tries to calm her down. Joey is tied up as is Topthorn. Emilie is kicking and screaming - but also desperately short of breath. \nGRANDFATHER She is my granddaughter! Emilie, stop! Don't hurt her, please! Don't hurt her. \nA soldier roughly shoves Emilie at him. \nBrandt approaches. Emilie screams at him, in tears. \nEMILIE You don't need them! There are so many others! \nEmilie is still sobbing. Grandfather hugs her - in horror that she is now struggling so hard for breath. \nGRANDFATHER Please, take the bigger one and leave the smaller one. You are breaking my granddaughter's heart. \nBRANDT (LEAVING) The war has taken everything from everyone. \nGRANDFATHER (CALLING AFTER) What will happen to them? \nBRANDT They will pull artillery until they DIE - EMILIE (COUGHING) Fran\u00e7ois! \n", "test1_id": 1497, "test2_input": "EXT. GERMAN TRENCH. THE SAME. \nPeter lowers his binoculars. \nPETER He's caught on the wire. \nEXT. BRITISH TRENCHES, THE SAME. \nGEORDIE SOLDIER Oh sod it... \nGeordie climbs up the side of the trench, and waves a white handkerchief tied to the end of his bayonet. \nBRITISH CAPTAIN What do you think you're doing? Get back, do you hear me? Corporal, that's an order! Get back! \nGeordie, not receiving fire, is emboldened to stand up. \nBRITISH SOLDIER Listen to him, sir. We can't leave him. \nHe waves the handkerchief to clearly signal he is no threat. \nEXT. GERMAN TRENCH. THE SAME. \nThe Germans look at the young soldier making his way over No Man's Land. PETER What's he doing? \nSECOND GERMAN It's a trap. \nPETER No, I don't think so. I think he's trying to help. \nThe second German cocks his rifle and starts to take aim. \nTHIRD GERMAN Scare him back into his hole. \nThe second German takes a shot aimed over the Geordie's shoulder. \nEXT. NO MAN'S LAND. THE SAME. \nThe Geordie crouches for cover, waving his handkerchief more frantically. \nGEORDIE It's a white flag, ent it? You see the white flag!? I'm just after tending to this here horse, is all! \nThe Georgie marshals his courage and stands again, waving the handkerchief. \nBRITISH CAPTAIN Get back, you stupid git! \nThere's no fire from the German trenches. Muttering to himself, the Geordie marches forward towards Joey: GEORDIE The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he leadeth me into green pastures, he lay me down beside the still waters... \nThe Geordie walks very slowly across the mud - there are bodies - the ground squelches beneath his feet. He waves his handkerchief as he walks. He crosses a narrow bridge that spans a flooded bomb crater. \nJoey, lying on his side, wrapped head to toe in barbed wire, covered in mud, watches Geordie approach. When Geordie gets too close, Joey freaks out and begins thrashing about. Joey whinnies a high scream of pain, because wire is cutting into his hide in several places, and as he thrashes it cuts him deeper. Particularly worrisome is a strand that's wrapped around his head, crossing right over his eye, threatening to slash it. The Geordie calls out in a soothing voice: \nGEORDIE (CONT'D) Poor beastie. Poor babbie. It's alright. It's alright. Don't buck and wriggle so, you're only shredding yourself. \nJoey calms a little, still moving his head up and down. \nGEORDIE (CONT'D) You'll blind yourself. \nHe reaches Joey and surveys the formidable tangle of wire in which Joey's bundled. The Geordie soothes and at the same time gingerly tests other strands, trying to figure out where to begin. \nGEORDIE (CONT'D) Bugger me worthless - I didn't think to bring gloves or something to cut THE - \nHe stabs his hand on one of the barbs. \nGEORDIE (CONT'D) OW! DAMN! OW!! \nThere's a noise behind him, and the Geordie turns around to see the Peter (the German from the trench) standing several feet away, holding some wire cutters. \nPETER I thought perhaps you might need these. He holds out the wire cutters. The Geordie, still frightened, stares stupidly at them. \nPETER (CONT'D) For the barbed wire? \nGEORDIE Yeah, yeah I... Ummm, thanks. Cheers. Cheers... \nHe reaches out and takes the proffered cutters. \n", "test2_true": "He returns to Joey, nervous about turning his back. He tries to figure out where to begin cutting. He lifts a long strand of wire that wraps around Joey's neck, stretches across his shoulder and torso and around one of his front legs. He puts the wire in the crux of the cutters and is preparing to snip when Peter steps closer to him. \nPETER That...That's a very long strand. When you cut it, it's going to release this - \nHe points to a wire wrapped around the wire the Geordie's lifting. Then he points to two other wires, similarly ENTANGLED: \nPETER (CONT'D) - and this, and this, and they'll coil back rather violently, which I'm afraid will only wound the poor fellow further. \nThe Geordie nods. \nGEORDIE You speak good English. \nPETER I speak English well. (re: the cutters) May I? \nThe Geordie hands them over and Peter surveys the wires. \nPETER (CONT'D) What if we cut his head free first? So he won't try to stand up and blind himself? And then - \nGEORDIE Pity you didn't bring a second pair. Then I could cut the wire here - \nHe points to one of the wires entangled with the strand he'd been prepared to cut. \nPeter stands and shouts in the direction of his trench. \nPETER WE NEED MORE WIRE CUTTERS! \nAll at once one, two, three, six pairs of cutters come soaring through the air and splash into the watery crater. \nMoments later - Peter and the Geordie kneel beside Joey, each with a pair of cutters. \nJoey is calming down again. The Geordie positions himself across Joey's body so that when he's cut the wire, it won't coil back and cut Joey. Peter positions himself to be able to cut the two wires in quick succession, holding the first wire to stop it from springing back. \nJoey's completely still now. \nPeter points between Joey's eyes. \nPETER (CONT'D) His blind spot. The cutters won't frighten him. If you could cut here, holding this wire - \nHe points to wires that intersect the wire that crosses Joey's eye. Then he points to the wire across Joey's eye. \nPETER (CONT'D) I could - \nGEORDIE Say no more, I'm right behind you. \nAs they reposition themselves, the Geordie says to Joey: \nGEORDIE (CONT'D) And you understand what's happening, do you not, O Best Beloved? That you must lay so very nice and still. There's a lad, you're a remarkable horse, you are, helping us help you. There's a lad. There's a remarkable lad. \nThe Geordie looks into Joey's huge eye as he and Peter get to work on their cutting. Joey returns his gaze. \nGEORDIE (CONT'D) So how's things in yonder trench? \nPETER Delightful. We read, we knit sweaters, and we train our rats to perform circus tricks. \nGEORDIE Well, if ever you need any more rats, we can always send ours over. `Cause we've more than we need, strictly speaking. Besides, they scare off all the pretty girls. \nPETER Our girls aren't afraid of rats. GEORDIE Big strapping German girls, eh? Kind what gives robust massages? \nThey laugh. \nPETER Every Thursday! And they bring rum cake on your birthday. \nBoth men smile at this while Joey is completely still; they work quickly, in concert, cutting the horse's head free of the wire. \nJoey raises his head, gives it a shake, neighs and then stirs a little. The two soldiers smile at one another. Then they set about cutting the rest of the wire; it's much easier now. \nThe Geordie cuts through the last wire binding Joey's legs. The two soldiers help as the horse staggers upright. \nGEORDIE Look at that horse! Look at the muscles he's got, them long legs. They're made for running, horses. Runnin' away from danger. \nPETER Running away is all they have. \n", "test2_id": 1498, "test3_input": "GEORDIE (CONT'D) - even asked the Major to say that Joey was his, an officer's horse, so that he could go back with the others. \nAlbert is amazed. He is about to show his gratitude when the sergeant major shouts: \nSERGEANT FRY Come on, Narracott! Get a move on. We don't want to miss the show. \nAlbert snaps to attention and begins to lead Joey out of the parade ground with the other horses. \nAs they walk off, the sergeant silently adds some of his own money to the notes in Albert's hand. \nEXT. MARKET PLACE. DAY. The intense bustle of the market. Farmers are gathered, bidding for horses. \nAUCTIONEER Seven pounds! Seven pounds there! Seven pounds! Eight pounds here! \nA groom leads Joey to the auction pen with other horses. \nAUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Eight pounds! Ten pounds here! Any advance? Sold! \nINT. AUCTION PEN. THE SAME. \nAlbert waits anxiously, the Geordie lad by his side, as Joey is led into the pen. \nGEORDIE You're alright. Nobody's gonna bid more than fifteen for a thoroughbred. They want work horses. \nThe auctioneer starts the bidding on Joey. \nAUCTIONEER Next one. We start at four pounds. Four pounds. \nThe farmers seem disinterested, shaking of heads. The bidding starts. Five pounds, six, seven, now it goes slowly, eight, nine, ten. Albert looks pleased at how it's going. He feels the cash in his hand. It seems to stick on ten, then a new hand comes up at the back of the auction - it is a nasty looking moustached man. THE BUTCHER Eleven. \nSergeant Fry scowls. \nSERGEANT FRY It's the butcher from Cambrai. He's been bidding for the best all morning. \nAUCTIONEER Eleven. Eleven pounds. Eleven pounds. \nSERGEANT FRY Let me handle this, private. (he calls out) ) Fifteen, and let that be an end to it. \nHe looks daggers at the Butcher. AUCTIONEER Fifteen pounds. \nBUTCHER Sixteen. \nAUCTIONEER Sixteen pounds. \nSERGEANT FRY Seventeen. \nBUTCHER Twenty of your English pounds. And let THAT be the end of it, my friend. \nAUCTIONEER Twenty pounds. \nSERGEANT FRY Twenty Five. \nAUCTIONEER Twenty five pounds. \nBUTCHER Twenty Six. \nAUCTIONEER Twenty six pounds. \nThe men are all looking very worried... There's not much left. SERGEANT FRY Twenty seven. \nBUTCHER Twenty eight. \nAUCTIONEER Twenty eight pounds. \nSERGEANT FRY Twenty nine. \nBUTCHER And thirty. \nAUCTIONEER Any advance at thirty pounds? \nThen, from the back, another, new French voice... FINAL BIDDER One hundred pounds. \nHe steps to the front of the crowd, and suddenly we see who it is. It is Emilie's Grandfather. \n", "test3_true": "Everyone looks at Albert who is devastated. Albert is reeling. He hears the auctioneer repeat the final amount and brings down his gavel. \nAUCTIONEER One hundred pounds. Going, going, gone. \nThe soldiers slowly disperse, leaving Albert to stare at Joey. It really is all over. \nEXT. THE AUCTION. THE SAME. \nThe Grandfather finishes paying for Joey. Albert and the Geordie stand in front of the grandfather. \nALBERT Sir, I'll give you all your money. Everything you paid when we get back to England. I'll give you twice - \nGRANDFATHER You don't know anything about him. \nALBERT Oh, but you're wrong, sir, I know everything! \nGRANDFATHER Yes, you found him! I heard you found a horse in the wire between the armies - \nGEORDIE No, I found him, he raised him - \nThe Grandfather goes to Joey and takes his reins. \nGRANDFATHER When I heard about the miracle horse, I traveled three days because I knew whose horse it was. My granddaughter's. She saved his life! He was everything to her. \nHe pauses, briefly, to collect himself. \nGEORDIE Where is your granddaughter? \nGRANDFATHER The war has taken everything from everyone. He is all that I have left of her. \nThe Grandfather leads Joey away. Joey pulls, firmly but not wildly, on the rein the grandfather's holding. The grandfather lets go. \nHe watches as Joey walks to Albert and nuzzles him. They have a moment together. The Grandfather watches carefully. \nAlbert puts his face right near Joey - speaks gently. \nALBERT Don't be worried, boy, when I go. I won't worry over you none. Hey, I found you, didn't I, and you found me. \nGrandfather softens and begins to wonder about this soldier. \nALBERT (CONT'D) And we'll both... we'll both know that we made it through. Now go on. \nHe leads Joey back to the Grandfather. ALBERT (CONT'D) We're the lucky ones. Always have been. Lucky since the day I met you. \nHe quietly hands over the reins. \nALBERT (CONT'D) God be with you, sir. \nThe grandfather looks at Albert, then takes the regimental pennant from his pocket: \nGRANDFATHER Do you know what this is? \nAlbert's amazed. \nALBERT It's my father's. It's his regimental pennant. How did you come by this, sir? \nGrandfather hands Albert the pennant. \nGRANDFATHER You may have this. \nAlbert takes the pennant and looks at it, his eyes filling with tears. \nALBERT Thank you ever so much for this, sir... \nGRANDFATHER (with a sigh) ... And this. \nHe hands Albert Joey's reins. Albert turns to face him, almost mute with disbelief. He reaches for his money. \nGRANDFATHER (CONT'D) No no, not necessary. He belongs to you. That is, of course, what my little girl would have wanted. And she was the boss. \nGrandfather laughs, then turns and slowly walks away. \n", "test3_id": 1499}

{"test1_input": "WAR HORSE \nWritten by \nLee Hall & Richard Curtis \nEXT. DEVON, ENGLAND. A SUMMER'S DAY, 1912. \nThe bucolic magnificence of the Devon countryside. We fly low over the high, thick hedges untouched for hundreds of years. The thick verdant countryside in all its splendor, ancient woodlands, fields of corn, and finally a paddock in a typical Devonshire dale. \nWe come to rest beside three farmers standing over a pregnant mare. The mare is in distress - she is about to give birth. The farmers calm the mare and tend to her gently with assurance and authority. \nWe pull back to see, ALBERT, a fifteen-year-old farm boy, watching the whole drama with delight from the paddock gate. \nFARMER Come on, easy, girl. Easy, girl. Easy. \nThe men hold the mare firmly, but clearly this is a difficult birth. \nFARMER 2 This is a stubborn one, huh? \nFARMER 3 There we go. Who's a clever girl? \nMoments later - the summer's sun glints off the wet, sticky hide of the foal (JOEY) - red hide, four white socks and a distinctive white cross on its forehead. \nSoon the creature is attempting its first clumsy steps. It is both awesome and comical to see the new born creature struggle to his feet, but eventually, he succeeds. Title: WAR HORSE \nEXT. PADDOCK/FIELD, DEVON. VARIOUS. \nWe follow Joey's progress over the course of his first year. His initial fearfulness, his connection with his mother, the intimacy of their relationship. \nAs Joey gets strong they run together, frolicking gayly in the last dregs of summer. Albert looking on. Joey notices him at the fence and they share a moment of connection. \nSpring: flowers are beginning to sprout by the hedgerows. Our boy Albert runs into the field. He takes an apple from his pocket - he holds it out tentatively. Joey approaches Albert with suspicion. Albert gently encourages him. \nHis mother paws the ground and neighs at Joey. He turns and runs over the field at her beck and call. \nAlbert tosses the apple to himself, ruefully - watches in awe as Joey races away with his mother. \nHe is a magnificent one year old. His distinctive red coat gleaming, now it is clear that he is half thoroughbred. He runs quickly around the field enjoying his own power and strength. \nLater - the three farmers open the gate and come into the field. Both Joey and his mother instinctively canter over to the two men, expecting food. The three men gently greet the horses and pet them, then we see one man has a noose made of a rope. He slips it round Mum's neck. She pulls back, Joey is shaken and bewildered but before he knows what's happening the second farmer is trying to get a similar rope around his neck. Joey balks and pushes the farmer aside, distressed to see his mother tethered. The farmer grabs Joey again and struggles with him, enlisting the help of the second farmer. With some effort they get the rope around his neck and calm him down. \nFARMER 2 Easy does it. Easy does it. Come on, steady does it. \nUnused to being tethered Joey pulls at the rope but the farmers are solid and firm. They gently lead Joey and his mother across the field to the gate and out into the road. \nThe whole road becomes overtaken by a flock of sheep on their way to the market. In the distance we hear the bustle of Market Day. \nEXT. THE MARKET. THE SAME. The farmers lead Joey and his mother through the chaos of the market and into an auction pen. They find themselves amongst a hoard of pigs, sheep and cows. Joey is agog at all of these creatures and all this life he had no idea existed. \nThe farmers lead the horses into a stall to await the auction. Joey is bewildered by all the noise - buttressed against a couple of mules and a cow. He is uncomfortable in this tight space. \nAn AUCTION WORKER holds a clipboard out for the lead farmer. \nAUCTION MAN 1 Mornin', pop. Put your mark here. Good luck. \nEXT. JOEY'S PEN. THE SAME. \nTwo men approach the pen. \nAUCTION MAN 2 Get the colt... \nOne man grabs Joey and pulls him out of the pen. Suddenly there is a look of horror on his face. His terrified mother realises they are being separated. Joey panics and desperately tries to get back to his mother, he rises up throwing the man who is leading him aside. Joey is out of control. The man regains control of Joey. \nAUCTION MAN 3 Whoa! Whoa! \nHe pulls Joey away from his mother, who lets out a heart- rending cry, paws the ground, and crashes her foreleg against the fence. Joey remains disoriented in the midst of the market day chaos. \nAUCTION MAN 3 (CONT'D) Easy... \nINT. MAIN AUCTION RING. THE SAME. \nThe auction ring is full of people of all shapes and sizes. There is a sense of celebration and busyness about market day. \n", "test1_true": "SI EASTON Forget it, Ted. He's half thoroughbred and not got a day's work in him. (points to a plow horse next to JOEY) Now, there... There's your ticket. \nIn contrast to Joey, the solid and bulky plow horse stands like a rock. But Dad remains fixated on Joey. \nDAD But look at him, Si. Look at that creature. \nIndeed, Joey is magnificent, his power clearly emerging because of his upset. \nSI EASTON Don't be daft. You need something solid to plow a field. \nDAD (fixed on Joey) Yeah, but he's something else, that one. \nThe AUCTIONEER announces the start of the auction... \nAUCTIONEER Alright gentlemen - settle down - settle down - horses on my right - men with money in their pockets on my left - it's the perfect combination. Is Fred Goddard here? FRED shouts his reply from the crowd. \nFRED YES! I's here. \nAUCTIONEER Good - more money than sense. Dave Hill? \nDAVE I'm here. Yes! \nAUCTIONEER Bugger off, you tight bastard - you've been coming here for 20 years - never bought so much as a pork scratching. \nThe crowd are loving all this. Dad notices a figure across the ring, LYONS, clearly a man of money. You can see something light up in Dad's eyes - a combination of dislike and alcohol. \nJoey is led into the auction pen. \nAUCTIONEER (CONT'D) Okay - first up today - a gorgeous young horse - prettiest thing I've seen since my wife on our wedding day. Let's get going, shall we? Who wants this wonderful creature. \nBut no-one bids. \nDAD One guinea. \nAUCTIONEER One guinea, one guinea, one guinea... \nYOUNG ANDREW EASTON I thought you needed a plow horse, Mister Narracott. \nAUCTIONEER Any advance on one guinea? Any advance on one guinea? \nJoey is still trying to get back to his mother. A voice from the crowd pipes up: \nLYONS Two guineas. DAD Three! \nSI EASTON Ted Narracott - it's completely the wrong animal. \nLyons whispers to his son, DAVID, 15, next to him. David eyes Joey skeptically. \nDAD Si Easton - I'm not gonna let that bastard see me off. \nLYONS Five guineas. \nDAD Six! SI EASTON Oh for the love of...! \nJoey is straining to get to his mother, the men are pulling him back. \nLYONS Seven. \nDAD Greedy sod thinks he can just buy anybody. (BIDDING) Eight. \nSI EASTON Stop it - he's your landlord - you can't be picking fights with him. \nLyons looks over. There is now tension in the crowd as they sense a Battle Royal for the horse. \nLYONS Ten guineas. \nHe smirks at Dad. \nSI EASTON You haven't got the money. Let's go home - let's have a pint. \nDAD Eleven guineas, sir, from as good a man as any in this town. \n", "test1_id": 1497, "test2_input": "Dad is mad with anger and frustration - and in pain. He staggers to his feet and leaves. Albert calms Joey down. Mrs. Narracott returns the harness to its hook. \nMRS. NARRACOTT I knew this would happen soon as I laid eyes on him.... \nBut then she notices Dad has returned. He has a gun. \nMRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D) Ted. No. Ted, no! \nDAD He's worth nothing to me! If he won't take the collar, he's not worth a damn thing! \nALBERT Dad? He grabs the rifle, but Dad shoves him away. \nDAD Move aside. \nDad raises the rifle, but Albert wrestles for it again. \nALBERT Dad. Stop. \nFurious with frustration Dad throws Albert to the ground and takes aim at the horse. \nMrs. Narracott quickly pulls the gun aside. \nMRS. NARRACOTT You shoot that horse we have nothing. \nDad whips the gun back towards Joey to find Albert standing between them - right in front of the gun's barrel. For a second we think Albert will be inadvertently shot. \nMRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D) NO! \nDad pauses his finger just in time. Albert gently holds the barrel of the gun. Speaks calmly. \nALBERT You were right what you said, Dad. \"He'll do it,\" you told Lyons, \"He'll plow that field.\" And he will! You'll see. He'll show you. We'll show you. We'll get it done. \nDad looks at him, frozen. Mrs. Narracott eases the gun away from him - MUM Let go. Let go. \n- and hands it to Albert, telling him - \nMUM (CONT'D) Go back to the house. \nAs Albert leaves, Ted takes out his flask. But Rosie takes it from him gently. He doesn't resist. \nMRS. NARRACOTT Here, here. Some days are best forgotten. Today ain't one of them. Come on. \nThey exit the stable together, leaving Joey in his stall. \nINT./ EXT. STABLES. DAWN. Albert walks towards the stables - enters. And talks to Joey as he prepares the harness. \nALBERT How are you today, Joey? I don't know much about life, boy, but I do know that there are big days and there are small days. And most days are small days, and, well, they don't matter much to anyone - but this - well, this is a big one. This is our big day. Well, it's cold out there. So I'm going to take this off - (he takes off his coat) Well, if it's tough for you - it should be tough for me, too... \nHe is left in just a loose-fitting white shirt.... \nALBERT (CONT'D) Now, I'm gonna teach you how to plow and you're gonna learn. Is that understood? And then we can be together, which is how I believe things are meant to be. \nJoey instinctively balks, but Albert is stern with him. \nALBERT (CONT'D) Boy. Steady, boy. Here we go. Here we go. \nAs he approaches Joey with the harness, Harold the goose enters the stable to watch. Albert approaches gently and slowly puts the harness over his own neck and shoulders to demonstrate - \nALBERT (CONT'D) Easy, easy... Look at me, Joey. See? See? You've just gotta put your nose through. \nIt is a moment between them. The horse looks Albert in the eye, then yields. Albert comforts him and show there is nothing to fear. Finally he gets the harness in place. \nALBERT (CONT'D) That's it. See? You've got it. You've got it. Good boy. There... \nHarold honks his approval. \nAlbert leads Joey out across the yard, through the broken gate. \nEXT. LOWER FIELD. THE SAME. \nIt is a grey day as they walk across the plowed fields towards the huge lower field. They come to a rusty, primitive plow left in the grass. Albert looks around the field - it is overgrown, it seems to go on forever - even if Joey was a plow horse this would be a heavy task. \nSi Easton and Andrew stroll up the road to watch. \n", "test2_true": "ANDREW Yet he will, I say. \nSI EASTON You'd swear he'd sprout wings and fly if Albert had told you so. (smiling at his son:) It's a fine thing, loyal to your mate. Even if he is a bit barmy. A team of two might manage, given a month and good weather. \nThey're interrupted by the honk of a horn as Lyons and David pull up in a car. Lyons and David get out. Their driver remains inside. \nLYONS Ted too squeamish to watch, is he? SI EASTON `Course he's watching. \nSi nods in the direction of the house. \nAlbert steadies Joey and starts to tie on the heavy plow. It just seems too big and bulky for Joey's sleek frame. Albert sets Joey right and fixes the plow. \nLyons, David, Si, and Andrew walk towards Dad, who looks on anxiously from a nearby hedgerow. Lyons gestures at David to stay back and walks over to Ted alone. He stands beside him and begins to talk gently. \nLYONS Well, you've raised him up a true Narracott, Ted, picture of his father, he is: not a dollop of ordinary sense but that thick stubbornness that'll lead him to insist on the impossible. \nDown in the field, Albert continues to prep the plow. \nLYONS (CONT'D) Wasn't a farmer in Devon didn't admire you, myself among `em, leaving your brothers that fine farm and setting yourself at this stoney patch of unpromising ground. You've fettle enough for twenty men, but with a gimpy leg and the drinking - for the pain, isn't it, that you drink? (MORE) LYONS (CONT'D) - yeah, none of us could have anticipated an ending better than this. Makes me question the wisdom of the charity that urged me to rent you this place, not only looking at you, me old pal, but that pretty little wife of yours, thought you were a spark, she did. \nTed hasn't acknowledged Lyons for a second; he's never taken his eyes off Albert. He simply stands and walks away as LYONS CONCLUDES: \nLYONS (CONT'D) And now your son's sinking into the selfsame bog that's swallowing you. \nAlbert has been meticulously preparing everything, positioning Joey, checking the tethers, digging the rusty plow in the earth. He takes his position behind the plow, throwing the rear leather harness over his own neck. \nALBERT See Joey - I got the collar, too! \nAlbert gently snaps the reins. Joey doesn't move, confused by the whole affair. \nALBERT (CONT'D) Come on, boy. Walk on. That's it. Walk on! Walk on, Joey. Come on, boy, walk on. \nLYONS You'd be better off startin' at the top of the hill and goin' down! Gravity's the only friend you're gonna have today, young lad. ALBERT Walk on, Joey! Walk on! Come on, Joey, walk on. Walk on, boy. \nAt the house, Mrs. Narracott opens an upstairs window to look on, anxiously. Ted, standing alone by the fence, only looks at Albert. \nALBERT (CONT'D) Walk on. Come on, walk on. \nTED (TO HIMSELF:) It'll take the whip to move him. \nJust as Ted is saying this, Albert, as if hearing his father, takes a breath and then abruptly produces a whip. Joey's ears prick up. Albert, grimly determined, snaps the whip at Joey. Joey panics and bolts. The plow spins to its side, pulls Albert off his feet. Joey drags them all the way to the top of the hill, right by the farmhouse. \nLyons, yelling, starts laughing and can't stop. \nLYONS Bravo! You've reached the top of the hill! Off you go again, boy! You'll make even better time comin' down!! \nHe continues past Dad, laughing. \nINTERCUT - Mrs. Narracott looks on from the house. He glances back at her. Her face is full of angry concern for their son. \nTownsfolk begin arriving, climbing the hill to the lower field. \nTed looks down, ashamed. Mrs. Narracott looks back at Albert, mortified, bruised, setting the plow right again. \nMrs. Narracott moves away from the window, takes a seat, and picks up her knitting. \nLater - Albert has made no progress. Joey is moving, but only in a useless circle. \nALBERT Good boy. Good lad. Good lad. Now walk on. Good boy. \nMore townsfolk clamor to the fence. Andrew calls out. ANDREW Albie, we're all with ya! \nAlbert tries to encourage him forward but Joey still isn't pulling sufficiently. The plow skips uselessly over the surface stones. \nLYONS Look look look! The plow hasn't even cut yet! \nAs Albert struggles with the plow, he sees Dad walking up the hill behind the spectators. He doesn't even turn to his son. \nJoey strains as Albert pushes with all his might. We sense the strain on the horse and the inappropriateness of the task. But Joey perseveres. The plow limps along. \nALBERT Do you know - I believe we can do it, Joey. I knew when I first saw you that you'd be the best of us. That's why he bought you. He knows you've all the courage he never had. I knew when I first saw you that you'd be the one who'd save us. \n", "test2_id": 1498, "test3_input": "ALBERT (CONT'D) I'm not stealing it. I'll give it back to him, someday. \nEXT. FIELD. DAY. \nEarly morning. Dad hobbling across the furrows, alone, planting the field by hand. \nEXT. NARRACOTT FARM. DEVON COUNTRY MONTAGE. Albert and Joey are now in a meadow. They trot past the field he plowed, now packed with a strong and sturdy crop, which Ted tends to. \nThe sun is breaking through and Joey starts to run across the field and up a small incline. As both Joey and Albert gain confidence they pick up speed. Albert pushes Joey on, they are going faster and faster, Albert yells with the exhilaration of it all. Joey races flat out across the countryside. Albert hanging on for dear life. \nAlbert and Joey pull up beside a sleek red car. It's Lyons' car, being driven by David Lyons, every inch the expensively- tailored rural gentry. \nDAVID Um, I'm the only boy that drives in the village. No one else drives but me. \nYOUNG WOMAN Oh, yeah? \nDAVID That's right and this is my dad's car. You're lucky that you're in it. I'm not normally allowed to drive it `cause it's so - \nAlbert urges Joey to go faster, till they're neck and neck beside the car, racing it. David Lyons looks to see Albert and Joey running alongside his car. He feigns disinterest. Albert glances at David, but he's much more interested in the very pretty young woman seated next to David, her hands trying to control her hair, flying in the wind. Forgetting himself momentarily, Albert stares at her, dazzled. The woman turns to David: \nYOUNG WOMAN Is he a friend of yours? \nShe smiles at Albert, encouraging him. David Lyons, annoyed, pushes the accelerator down, and the car edges ahead of Joey. \nBut not for long. The sound of the acceleration and Albert's eagerness to impress the young woman make Joey go faster, and again he moves out ahead of the car. The young woman grins at Albert. \nUp ahead Albert sees that the wall alongside of which he's been racing turns the corner, presenting him and Joey with an obstacle. Albert encourages Joey to go faster. \nALBERT Come on, boy, let's show her how to fly! \nThey head right for the wall, but at the very last moment, Joey balks and comes to a dead standstill, sending Albert sailing over the wall. \nBack in the car, the girl gasps and covers her mouth, concerned. David says nothing, but allows himself a small smile. \nOn the other side of the wall, Albert stands a bit battered, but unfazed. \nALBERT (CONT'D) Well...you're clearly not gonna be a jumper. \nThunder starts to rumble ominously in the background. \nEXT. NARRACOTT FARM. NIGHT. \nAlbert and Joey return, driving sheep before them. Angry storm clouds stretch to the horizon. \nEXT. NARRACOTT FARM. NIGHT. \nAs Albert leads Joey to the stable, lighting blasts across an angry sky. The rain is falling in torrents. \nINT. FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. Another crack of thunder - and a piece of wood in the roof gives way - water gushes in - Dad rushes to support the roof as the wind forces a window open. \nAt that moment, the door suddenly swings open with the violence of the storm, smashing against the wall - Dad and Rosie turn - and there is Harold the goose, who scuttles in without his usual arrogance and hides himself in a corner. \nMRS. NARRACOTT Shoo, Harold. Shoo, shoo, shoo! \nThe thunder cracks again and... \nEXT. LOWER FIELD. DAY. \nAlbert and Dad walk across the field. Mrs. Narracott digs through the mess. The entire crop is flat - ruined by the storms. The ground squelches beneath their feet. The whole field is a write off. \nALBERT We can try planting something else, or we could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob. \nDad doesn't answer. He shakes his head and limps away. \nALBERT (CONT'D) How else we gonna pay Mr. Lyons' rent? \nTed doesn't turn around. \nINT. KITCHEN. EVENING. \nMrs. Narracott makes some coffee. Ted sits alone on a chair. \nMRS. NARRACOTT What we gonna do? \n", "test3_true": "ROSE Well, I might hate you more - but I'll never love you less. Then somewhere in the distance, an unfamiliar sound... \nEXT. LANE LEADING TO THE VILLAGE. EVENING. \nA motorbike rumbles along the lane at huge speed creating a cloud of dust as it goes. The noise of the motorbike is drawing attention from all over the valley. It can be heard fields away and everyone is drawn to this completely unheard of sound. \nEXT. THE VILLAGE. EVENING. \nThe motorbike whizzes through the village. Heads turn in astonishment. \nMOTORBIKE RIDER It's war! The bike comes to a stop in the market place. The rider takes off his goggles. \nMen of the village start to flock around the machine, with great curiosity. \nMOTORBIKE RIDER (CONT'D) We are at War with Germany. You hear? England is at war with Germany. \nShock and amazement. The rider takes off his goggles: \nMOTORBIKE RIDER (CONT'D) They're going to ring the bells at six o'clock - and then never ring them again until the war is over. \nEveryone across England knows that their lives are about to change. \nEXT. FARM YARD. DAY. \nDawn rises over the farm. \nEXT. FARM YARD. DAWN. \nAlbert races to the stables, excited with the campaign pennant. \nINT. STABLES. THE SAME. \nAs Albert enters the stables, he calls out: \nALBERT Look smart, Joey lad, it's the Tavistock Fair! \nAlbert opens the doors and stops dead. He looks at the empty stables. \nEXT./ INT. KITCHEN / YARD. DAY. \nAlbert runs out. \nHe rushes into the kitchen. His mother stares out the window. She has been crying. \nALBERT What has he done with him? \nShe says nothing, but her face gives everything away. Albert in a panic turns and runs out into the lane. Mrs. Narracott tears up again. EXT. SQUARE OF A MARKET TOWN. THE SAME. \nThe market square is full of military men. The Union Jack is flying up the flagpole. A group of girls has gathered to check out the army boys. Eager young men crowd a table staffed by recruiting officers: \nRECRUITING OFFICER Last name first. First name, middle name, last. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS is in the square inspecting Joey, knowledgably. He is a handsome, attractive, modest, upper class man. Dad stands beside him. He checks Joey's teeth, his feet and finally, looks him straight in the eye. \nDAD Take my word for it - finest horse in the parish. Goes like a racer, strong, decent, very fine. \nCaptain Nicholls has immediately connected with Joey and puts him at his ease. SAM PERKINS, a tough sergeant, is physically inspecting Joey. \nSAM PERKINS No curbs, no splints, good feet and teeth. He's as sound as a bell, sir. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS And how much are you charging, sir - for this strong, decent, and very fine animal?! DAD Forty. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS I'll give you twenty and not a penny more. \nDAD Twenty is no good to me, Captain. Thirty five and he's yours. \nCAPTAIN NICHOLLS I don't even know how he rides. \nDAD Oh, he rides... Splendidly. You'll be astonished. I promise you that. (his heart's in his throat, fighting back GRIEF) Finest horse in all of Devon. Finest horse I ever seen. \nEXT. SQUARE OF A MARKET TOWN. THE SAME. \n", "test3_id": 1499}

1 EXT. GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 1 
From high above we see the castle gardens covered in a blanket of snow. We hear the tread of footsteps then see a beautiful WOMAN in a fur-lined cloak heading towards an unseen object. 
ERIC (V.0.) Once upon a time, in deep winter, a Queen was admiring the falling snow when she saw a rose blooming in defiance of the cold. The rose looks miraculously red. Nearby, a RAVEN looks on. The Queen gazes at the flower, then bends down. 
ERIC (V.0.) Reaching for it, she pricked her finger and three drops of blood fell. BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell, a DROP OF BLOOD lands in the snow. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. The Queen startles, then calmly touches her stomach. 
ERIC (V.0.) And because the red seemed so alive against the white, she thought, if only I had a child as white as snow, lips as red as blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and all with the strength of that rose. A beat, then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby -- 
2 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 2 
We find ourselves in a crowded chamber full of MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS. Moving through the chaos we glimpse buckets of water, dirty sponges, astrology charts and protection charms -- until we see a BABY GIRL in the arms of her happy mother. 
ERIC (V.O.) Soon after, a daughter was born to the Queen and was named "Snow White." With a radiant smile, the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her proud father, KING MAGNUS. The baby's CRIES grow louder as the King cradles her gently in his arms, turning towards a mirror. 
ERIC V/O And she was adored throughout the kingdom as much for her defiant spirit as for her beauty. 
3 EXT. WOODS NEAR CASTLE - DAY. 3 
A wounded MAGPIE is twitching in a puddle of water. SNOW WHITE, aged 7 now, steps towards it hesitantly, looking concerned.

YOUNG SNOW WHITE Pick it up, William. Her companion, William, also 7, braces himself, reaches down, then steps back in alarm as the bird starts flapping wildly. He tries to cover his embarrassment by sounding knowledgeable. 
YOUNG WILLIAM It's dying. It doesn't want to be touched. Snow White ignores him, approaching the bird herself. She kneels down, hesitates, then reaches out and strokes the magpie, calming its flapping before she picks it up. High up on a tree, ANOTHER MAGPIE looks on. 
4 EXT. SEASIDE VILLAGE/ CASTLE BRIDGE - DAY 4 
SNOW WHITE runs, cupping the wounded bird in her hand, William dashing after her. The sun is out and the fields and forests are lit up in all their glory. The children sprint through a BEAUTIFUL SEASIDE VILLAGE -- thatched homes with flower gardens, HAPPY FARMERS and FAIR VILLAGE MAIDENS -- 
YOUNG SNOW WHITE Hurry, William! Hurry! They run down the dunes, waves crashing, the sand gleaming in the sunlight, until they see the BEAUTIFUL CASTLE up ahead -- 
5 EXT. CLOISTER GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY 5 
A single apple tree stands in the middle of the cloisters. It stands out. Snow White and William dash past it into the castle.

7 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 7 
Snow White bursts into her parent's chamber. The King and Queen turn from the window. Two PHYSICIANS are in attendance. Snow White is too young and preoccupied to notice but her mother's smile is tinged with sadness and her father looks heartbroken. 
YOUNG SNOW WHITE We found it in the woods. The Queen takes the wounded magpie from Snow White. The King looks on sadly as she pulls a RIBBON from Snow White's hair and carefully binds the magpie's wing. William watches from the doorway, noticing how frail the Queen looks. The magpie's flapping gradually calms, its pain easing. 
QUEEN It will heal in time. Snow White's eyes are fixed on the little bird.

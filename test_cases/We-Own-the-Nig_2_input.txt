BOBBY GREEN I'm real glad you're home... 
The two separate, both smiling gently. Breaking the moment: (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SANDRA GRUSINSKY Everyone, let's, let's move inside-- there's plenty to eat! 
Soft laughter. Small talk begins. The group dissipates, moves to eat, etc. Burt moves to Joseph: 
BURT GRUSINSKY Joseph--we got some things we need to discuss, when you get the chance. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY We could do it now if you want, Pop. In the den. 
Burt nods, reluctantly. All our men walk to the den-- except for Bobby, who hears: ROSARIO, down the hall. She approaches him. 
ROSARIO DIAZ Bobby, I'm gonna go back to the motel. 
BOBBY GREEN What're you talking about? They got a lot of food over there--why don't you go eat something? 
ROSARIO DIAZ (shakes her head) N--I'm gonna go back. 
A beat. Bobby senses she's not completely right. Looks into her eyes, then, more an accusation than a question: 
BOBBY GREEN (WHISPERED) You fucked up? 
A muttered "no" from Rosario, hardly a committed denial. Before he can say anything, from the DEN, Burt peeks his head out: 
BURT GRUSINSKY Bobby--you should hear this too, for the trial. 
Burt motions for Bobby to enter the den.       Back to Rosario: 
BOBBY GREEN We gotta straighten this out later. 
Bobby then moves to the den. 
INT. JOSEPH'S HOUSE - DEN 
Burt and Joseph and Jack and Mike.    Bobby enters the room. As he does, we HEAR: 
MICHAEL SOLO Nezhinski's cache was huge, about 40 keys--yayo, some angel dust too. 
BURT GRUSINSKY We're gonna try and turn him, get him to tell us how they're bringing it in. But don't worry--we'll make sure he does plenty of time. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY He ain't gonna be reliable, Pop. 
Bobby closes the door behind him softly.       Joseph sees Bobby, is surprised he's here... 
BURT GRUSINSKY Well, you marry an ape, you don't complain about the stench of bananas. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Where is he? 
JACK SHAPIRO He's at Rikers. Tucked in, nice and comfy. We're taking him to the A.D.A. next week, for a meeting. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY I wanna go with you on that. See his fuckin' face. 
Jack nods. 
MICHAEL SOLO I'll tell you, though--streets're dead. Junkies're waitin' out there for something big, no question. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY That's `cause we got their number one. Dried it up at the source. 
All of a sudden, a VOICE from behind: 
BOBBY GREEN That don't mean nothing. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Everyone turns around, slightly surprised Bobby's opened his mouth here: 
BURT GRUSINSKY What's that, Bobby? 
BOBBY GREEN There's a whole network full of suppliers. The organization goes deep. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY Bobby--you done a lot for us already. You don't gotta get involved in this anymore. Okay? 
BURT GRUSINSKY I asked him to come in, Joe. If he's gonna have to testify, he should know all this. 
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY This's police business, Pop--you gonna make him an honorary member of the Force now? 
An ugly beat.    Then: 
BOBBY GREEN I'll be outside if you need me. 
Bobby exits, and Burt watches him depart. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
The unaware crowd is having a great time. Children run around the rooms. Bobby SEES GUARD #2, approaches. Burt comes up next to him, takes him into a corner: 
BURT GRUSINSKY BOBBY-- (SOTTO) What was said in there, he--he didn't mean it. 
Bobby contemplates this; we SEE that he tacitly accepts his father's words. Then: 
BOBBY GREEN Well, why's he goin' back to work so soon, anyway? He ain't ready.

SAMMY Um, OK. 
INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 
SAMMY comes down the stairs, fully dressed, into the living room, where Terry and Rudy are still watching TV. 
SAMMY Um -- I have to go out for a minute. Do you want anything? 
TERRY Like what? 
SAMMY I don't know. 
RUDY Where are you going? 
TERRY Yeah, where are you going? 
SAMMY I just have to go out for a little while. 
RUDY Where? 
TERRY Yeah, where? 
SAMMY I just have to go to Mabel's house. 
RUDY Why? 
SAMMY You know what, Rudy? It's personal. This is a personal matter that has to do with Mabel. I just have to go see her for a little while. 
Terry gives Sammy a look like, "You've got to be kidding." Sammy tries to shush him with a conspiratorial look back. She goes out. 
LATER. Terry and Rudy sit in front of the TV, alone. 
TERRY Listen. Listen. I'm sorry I said you squealed on me. I was totally out of line, and I really owe you an apology. (Pause) Did you hear what I said? 
RUDY (Staring at the TV) I don't care.

INT. CHURCH -- RECTORY -- OFFICE. DAY 
RON the MINISTER and Sammy drink coffee in silence. 
RON (Gently) What's on your mind, Sammy? 
SAMMY Well, a lot. But principally... I was just wondering if you had an opinion. If you know someone, in your family, or just someone you really care about, and they just can't seem to get ahold of themselves...

As Anna walks inside. Olaf starts counting. 
OLAF (CONT'D) One...two... 
Kristoff joins in. 
OLAF AND KRISTOFF Three...four... 
INT. ELSA'S PALACE -- DAY 
Anna walks into a great foyer. The place is beautiful, but also eerie. 
ANNA Elsa? It's me...Anna?! 
Anna slips. Steadies herself. 
ELSA (O.S.) Anna. 
Elsa steps out of the shadows onto a balcony. She sees Anna, looks to her longingly. 
Anna can't help but be struck by Elsa's beauty. 
ANNA Elsa, you look different.... It's a good different.... And this place is amazing. FROZEN - J. Lee 
ELSA (cautious, polite) Thank you, I never knew what I was capable of. 
Anna starts to climb the stairs. 
ANNA ...I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd known-- 
Elsa backs up, away from Anna. 
ELSA (on guard) No, it's okay. You don't have to apologize.... But you should probably go, please. 
ANNA But I just got here. 
ELSA ...You belong in Arendelle. 
ANNA So do you. 
Anna takes another step up. Elsa backs up more. 
ELSA No, I belong here. Alone. Where I can be who I am without hurting anybody. 
ANNA ...Actually, about that-- 
OLAF (O.S.) 
ELSA Wait. What is that? 
Olaf comes running in the front door. He waves. 
OLAF Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs. 
ELSA (shocked) Olaf? 
Olaf stops beside Anna, looks up at Elsa, intimidated. FROZEN - J. Lee 
OLAF (bashful) You built me. You remember that? 
ELSA (astonished) And you're alive? 
OLAF Um...I think so? 
Anna kneels down beside Olaf. 
ANNA He's just like the one we built as kids.... We were so close. We can be like that again. 
Elsa smiles, but then a memory returns to her. 
FLASH CUT TO: 
FLASHBACK: Young Anna is struck by Elsa's powers. 
YOUNG ELSA Anna! 
Young Anna falls unconscious. Young Elsa races to her. 
FLASH CUT TO: 
THE PRESENT: Elsa's face sinks in pain. 
ELSA No, we can't.

Paul shakes off his boots. 
PAUL Oh I see.  No, you see that must have been Raymond.  (beat) Very much so.  No, no one was more surprised than we were. (beat)  No, he's... indisposed right now, but I'm sure you'll see him again.  He's going to stay at the cabin for a while until he... leaves.  And bless you too.

47    EXT. WILDERNESS ROAD - NIGHT                                                  47 
A "Moose Xing" sign is briefly illuminated by Paul's car's headlights as it heads up a snow packed mountain road.  The distant lights of the city are swallowed by the thick forests of fir trees that line the road. 
48    INT. PAUL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                  48 
Paul, nervous, sings along to "Escape" on the radio. 
PAUL "...It was my own lovely lady, and she said, oh it's you..." 
A48   EXT. WILDERNESS ROAD / TURNOUT - NIGHT                                       A48 
Paul pulls off.  Kills his headlights.  Pops the trunk. 
49    EXT. FOREST - LATER                                                           49 
The corpse, now in Raymond's clothing and the blue parka, lies face up on the Aloha Airlines promotional surfboard being lurched forward by Paul, who wears a pair of snowshoes.  On the body's chest lies a second pair of snowshoes. Somewhere, a WOLF HOWLS. 
50    EXT. TOP/BOTTOM OF A RIDGE - LATER                                            50 
Paul at the top of a 25 foot drop.  He rolls the corpse, now wearing the other set of snowshoes, over the side.  It BOUNCES down, landing in the snow with a soft WHUMPH! 
51    OMITTED                                                                       51 
52    INT. PAUL'S HOME / KITCHEN - DAWN                                             52 
Paul sits in a seeming stupor at the kitchen table.  A DING from the microwave snaps him out of his catatonic state.  He walks to the appliance, takes out his now re-heated coffee, checks his watch and heads out. 
53    EXT. TOP OF THE RIDGE / FOREST - MORNING                                      53 
Paul, wearing snowshoes and carrying the surfboard, peeks over the edge. 
PAUL'S POV: down at the corpse, exactly as it was last night. 
PAUL Well come on!  How much easier do I have to make this? 
His words echo in the cold wilderness. 
54    INT.  PAUL'S KITCHEN  - DAY                                                   54 
Jodie the dog is in a complete frenzy, jumping up and down at the feet of Paul who stands over a SIZZLING frying pan full of bacon.  He checks the bacon's consistency with a fork.  Still pretty raw.  He takes the bacon and lays it on a plate. 
Beside the pan on the counter sit a baseball cap and a stapler.  Paul carefully takes each strip of bacon and staples it to the peak of the ball cap.  He holds it up.  The bacon hangs down like fringe. 
Margaret appears in the doorway. 
MARGARET Paul? 
PAUL (startled) Holy-- Margaret, you scared the wits out of me. 
Margaret lifts up Jodie, who's desperately trying to get at the hat. 
MARGARET She just wants that bacon. 
PAUL Such a little puppy.  How late is "Rudys" open? 
55    EXT. SHOPPING CENTER / RUDYS MARKET  - LATE AFTERNOON                         55 
A large sign outside advertises "Fresh Moose Meat". Paul runs out with a shopping bag, jumps in his car and drives off. 
56    EXT. BOTTOM OF THE RIDGE - SUNSET                                             56 
Paul, carrying the shopping bag, he painfully picks his way down the rock face toward the corpse. 
PAUL (really bad British accent) You may want to take a gander.  You may want to take a gander... 
CUT TO: 
57    EXT. BOTTOM OF THE RIDGE - SUNSET                                             57 
THE BACON HAT -- as Paul pulls it snug on the corpse's head.  He pulls the bloody steaks from the shopping bag and starts to smear them on the corpse's parka.  Drops of blood hit the snow at the body's feet and disappear.

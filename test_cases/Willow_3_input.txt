Willow swallows hard.  He and Madmartigan follow Raziel inside. 
INT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY 
Daylight is soon replaced by the orange glow of molten lava. 
WILLOW Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places. 
MADMARTIGAN Want me to carry Elora? 
WILLOW I'm used to her.  How's she doing? 
Willow wears the papoose on his back.  Madmartigan looks in at the baby's face. 
MADMARTIGAN She's doing a lot better than we are, Peck. 
Willow and Madmartigan laugh, which breaks the tension. Then a geiser of steam hisses near them and a bat screeches somewhere and the tension's back.  They keep going. 
INT. DEEPER IN THE CAVE 
Hot liquid drips from the ceiling.  Hissing steam bub- bles from the floor.  they go single-file along a ledge over a foaming lava pit.  Raziel is squawking way ahead in the distance. 
MADMARTIGAN Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong? 
WILLOW She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress. 
MADMARTIGAN She's a bird, Willow. 
WILLOW That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and-- 
MADMARTIGAN Watch it! 
WILLOW Ahhh! 
Madmartigan lunges and grabs Willow just as he is about to fall into the lava pit.  He hauls him to safety. They gasp with relief. Then they head deeper into the cave.  They stop.  They hear something.  Something strange. 
Then, something moves on the wall. 
WILLOW I hate this. 
The cave walls come to life.  Down them crawl ugly ROCK PUFFERS, pillow-sized wall crabs that screech horribly like bats.  Madmartigan fights them off with his sword. The Rock Puffers bloat themselves up, tripling their size.  Madmartigan stabs one and it hisses away like an untied balloon. 
Suddenly, distant hoofbeats thunder and echo.  Madmar- tigan flashes his sword and turns around, ready to de- fend Willow and the baby against the army. 
MADMARTIGAN Go, Willow!  Run!  Run! 
Willow listens as the hoofbeats get louder and louder. At last he turns and runs deeper into the cave.  Mad- martigan waits. 
The Nockmaar soldiers, now increased to eighty, come charging down the cave.  Kael rides in the lead along- side the turncoat Cuth.  As they gallop along the ledge, Cuth makes the mistake of crowding Kael, who an- grily elbos him, horse and all, into the boiling pit. 
The army tramples over the Rock Puffers, which explode underfoot.  Madmartigan braces himself as they stampede toward him.  But suddenly the horseman all screech thir horses to a halt.  The horses rear and back away. 
Madmartigan stands there, wondering.  Then suddenly a shadow looms behind him.  He turns. 
The EBORSISK roars and the cave shakes and thunders. It's an enormous two-headed monster that doesn't like visitors. 
MADMARTIGAN Willow!  Willow! 
He looks around frantically.  Willow is nowhere to be seen.  Then the baby cries out.  Madmartigan sees them, cowering behind a rock.  He runs toward them.  The Eborsisk exhales flames over his head. 
KAEL Go after them! 
Soldiers obey Kael and go after Madmartigan.  He fights them, hacking down a few, while a few others are in- cinerated by the Eborsisk.  Sorsha's horse rears as she watches Madmartigan battle for his life.  Archers shoot arrows, which pierce the Eborsisk and make it even an- grier. 
Willow digs one of his magic acorns out of his pocket. A head of the Eborsisk gnashes at Madmartigan.  Madmar- tigan looks to Willow for help. 
MADMARTIGAN Hurry, Willow!  Throw it! 
Willow winds up and throws with all his might.  The Eborsisk blasts a flame, which startles Willow, wreck- ing his aim.  Madmartigan's eyes pop open and he ducks as the acorn whistles by his ear.  The acorn bounces off a rock and flies back, trickles along the ground and hits a Nockmaar soldier, who is already dead.  The soldier's body turns to stone. 
RAZIEL Look out! 
One of the Eborsisk's heads lunges toward the baby. Raziel dives like a rocket and attacks the monster's eye as Willow whisks the baby away. 
Then Madmartigan leaps up on the Eborsisk.  He climbs up over its flaming head and drives his sword down through its skull.  The Eborsisk howls horribly and its wounded head falls.  Madmartigan topples down its back and leaps onto a horse, knocking its rider off and, all in one swashbuckling move, scooping Willow and the baby up onto the back of the horse and galloping away. 
KAEL After them!! 
But as his horsement charge forward, the Eborsisk falls to its knees, half-dead.  The surviving head blasts the soldiers with fire.  They rear back on their horses and continue to battle the monster with arrows and spears.

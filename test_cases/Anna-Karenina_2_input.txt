LEVIN How can she? I mean, look at me! Suppose she's only marrying me to get married? Suppose she's still in love with Vronsky? 
She's making a terrible mistake! I'll go to her and tell her she's free, that's what I must do . . . 
MATVEY Your coat, sir. 
Levin snatches the coat and puts it on, and dashes out of the room. 
INT. ENTRANCE HALL, SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE-- DAY 
Levin, in disarray, is let into the house. The entrance hall is crowded, loud and chaotic with children, maids, governesses and Kitty's mother. Tanya, Masha and Lili are bridesmaids. Grisha is a page. Princess Shcherbatsky, trying to create order among last-minute bouquet distribution, hair- adjustments, shoe-changing, etc., sees Levin and explodes. 
PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY Konstantin!--what-- ? 
LEVIN I have to talk to Kitty. 
PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY You're not allowed to see her! 
Levin gallops up the stairs. 
INT. KITTY'S ROOM, SHCHERBATSKY HOUSE--DAY 
Kitty, dressed for the church, is whispering into the crack of the bedroom door. 
KITTY No. I don't understand at all! What's the matter with you? 
INT. OUTSIDE KITTY'S ROOM, SAME TIME--DAY 
LEVIN You can't love me. Think it over! Let people say what they like! 
KITTY ( FRIGHTENED) Are you mad? Have you changed your mind? 
LEVIN Yes. If you don't love me. 
KITTY But I do love you! 
Levin hesitates, desperate. 
LEVIN Do you? Well, I love you! 
KITTY Oh, Konstantin! 
They link hands through the opening, each with a hand to kiss. 
OVER-- CHURCH ORGAN MUSIC 
INT. CHURCH--DAY 
A mere fragment of a long and ornate marriage ceremony . . . 
The grizzled Priest lights two decorated candles, holding them askew in his left hand, and he uses his right hand to touch Levin and, more tenderly, Kitty. He gives the couple the candles, Kitty taking hers in her gloved hand. Levin looks blissfully at Kitty. 
MIX TO 
The Priest lifts crowns from their heads, and invites them to kiss each other, relieving them of their candles. 
The Choir bursts with pride. 
INT. NURSERY, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY 
The baby girl, two months old, is being fed by a Wet Nurse. Replete, the baby is given over to the Nursemaid who lays the child in her crib. 
Karenin watches all this. The women ignore him: they are used to him now, and Karenin is harmless. Karenin stares fascinated at the baby, who stares back. 
INT. BOUDOIR, KARENIN HOUSE, ST. PETERSBURG-- DAY 
Anna stares at herself in the mirror. The act of raising a pair of scissors is an effort. She isolates a thick lock of her hair, and snips it off. 
INT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY 
Anna's hair is short all over. She sits up in bed, listening to Princess Betsy, who has brought the current gossip. 
BETSY . . . and there was her husband wearing her best ballgown, rouge all over his face . . . ma chere, le scandale! . . . But I'd better tell you some regimental news . . . 
INT. ENTRANCE HALL, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY

KARENIN Who is here?

INT. BEDROOM LEVEL, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY 
Karenin approaches the bedroom door. 
anna (O.C.) No--I don't want to see him.

INT. BEDROOM, KARENIN HOUSE, SAME TIME--DAY 
Anna sees Karenin who is about to retreat. 
KARENIN Please excuse me. 
ANNA No--stay. 
BETSY I am so glad to see you. Everyone asks after you. 
Karenin bows to her and kisses Anna's hand.

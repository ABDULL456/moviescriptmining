A GREENE AND GREENE BUNGALOW IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS, AMERICAN ART POTTERY ALL AROUND.  MOSS IN BLUEJEANS AND A HAWAIIAN HAT, PACING BACK AND FORTH, SMOKING LIKE A CHIMNEY. 
MOSS But at some point they gotta know. 
BREAN Who? 
MOSS The... (HE GESTURES OUT OF HIS WINDOW, MEANING, "THE PUBLIC") 
BREAN "They Got To Know?"  Stan...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk Driver.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The truth, I was in the building when they shot that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building. 
MOSS Is that true? 
BREAN How the fuck do we know.  You take my point? 
MOSS (SHAKING HIS HEAD) ...going to War... 
BREAN It's not "war."  It is a Pageant.  It's a Pageant... Like the Oscars... why we came to you... 
MOSS I never won an Oscar. 
BREAN N'it's a crying shame.  But you staged the Oscars... 
MOSS Yes.  Indeed I did. (PAUSE) 
HE LOOKS OVER AT HIS WALL FULL OF PLAQUES AND TROPHIES. 
MOSS (CONT.) You know, you're a writer, that's your script.  You're a director... (HE GESTURES, ET CETERA.) But if you're the producer ... what did you do? (PAUSE) What did you do?  All you've got is the credit... (PAUSE) Some plaque on the wall... 
HE SHAKES HIS HEAD SADLY. 
BREAN And if you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... (PAUSE) 
MOSS Hell, I'd just do it for the hell of having done it, for a story to tell... 
BREAN Well, no, well, you couldn't tell any... 
MOSS Hey, I know that, hey, I'm kidding... (PAUSE) "It's a pageant" 
BREAN ...that's what it is. 
MOSS (TO HIMSELF) "The Country Is At War." (PAUSE) 
BREAN It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. (PAUSE) 
MOSS ...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha. (PAUSE) Why Albania? 
BREAN Because. 
MOSS They got to have something that we want. 
BREAN I'm sure they do. 
MOSS What do we have that they want? 
BREAN "Freedom." 
MOSS Why would they want that? 
HAKAN They're Oppressed. 
MOSS No, no, no.  Fuck Freedom.  No.  Fuck Freedom. They.... They Want... They Want To Destroy the Godless Satan of the United ... They want to destroy our Way of Life.  Okay, okay, okay, could we ... okay:  the President is in China.  He is dealing with a Dispatch of the B-2 Bomber to Albania.  Why? (HE SHRUGS, HOLDS UP HIS HANDS, TO SAY, "YOU TELL ME...") 
AMES Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically... 
MOSS GESTURES FOR SILENCE. 
MOSS We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The Bomb, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not there -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a suitcase Bomb.  Ooookay.  It's a suitcase bomb, and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA. 
AMES You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's cost effective.  This is.... 
MOSS (SHRUGS) It's producing. 
AMES No, this is great. 
MOSS I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant, 
GRACE COMES IN WITH A PHONE, TO AMES. 
GRACE I have the White House on the Line. 
MOSS ...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot. 
AMES (TAKES THE PHONE) Ames here.  Yessir... (HE LISTENS.) 
MOSS Okay.  Okay.  The Suitcase Bomb...

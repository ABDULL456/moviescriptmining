The kids reluctantly shuffle off. 
BRIAN 'Bye, Gabriel. 
GABRIEL See ya, kids. Be sure to study your math. 
He has the same sunglasses as Simon. The same cold, creepy air about him. 
KATHERINE Who are you? 
GABRIEL It's a long story. 
Jerry suddenly snorts loudly, trying to retrieve a sticky red glop that starts running out of his nose. 
GABRIEL Ignore him. 
JERRY Everyone else does. 
KATHERINE I don't know what the hell is going on, but you both better get out of here. Right now. 
GABRIEL You're right... 
He climbs to his feet and stands close to her. 
GABRIEL ...You have no idea what's going on. 
He stands there a beat. That terrible coldness that swirls about him. The shriek of ghosts under his breath. Then he climbs into the rambler with Jerry and pulls away. Katherine watches the car drive off, then yells over to the school janitor. 
KATHERINE Al! Keep an eye on the children for me. I'll be right back. And call the sheriff. 
JANITOR Sheriff? What the hell do I tell him? 
KATHERINE Just call. 
Katherine gets into her pickup and starts the engine. 
EXT. THE TOWN - DAY 
Katherine drives through the main drag and out past the fringe of town. As she passes the old copper mine she sees, parked near the mine's tunnel entrance, Gabriel's rambler. 
EXT MARY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER - DAY 
As Katherine pulls up, she's surprised to see Thomas climbing out of his own car. 
KATHERINE You weren't suppose to be here till noon. 
DAGGETT You're a little early yourself. 
KATHERINE I wanted to check on her. 
DAGGETT That makes two of us. 
CUT TO: 
On the sandy lot that extends back from the trailer is a wizened cottonwood tree. Katherine, Thomas, and Mary are seated beneath its shade. Katherine is protective of the little girl, running a hand maternally through her hair. 
KATHERINE How are you feeling, pumpkin? 
MARY Better. 
KATHERINE This is Mr. Dagget, Mary. He'd like to ask you some questions. You don't have to answer if you don't want to. 
MARY It's okay. 
There's a dreamy, far-away look in Mary's eyes. It worries Katherine. 
DAGGETT Mary, when you talked to man up in the building -- 
MARY -- Simon. 
DAGGETT Yes, Simon. What did Simon say? 
MARY (smiles) That's funny. "Simon says". 
DAGGETT Right. Like the game. 
MARY I'm good at it. I'm very clever. 
DAGGETT We'll have to play together sometime. 
MARY Simon even said so. He also asked if I could keep a secret. 
DAGGETT And what was that? 
MARY Something he gave me.

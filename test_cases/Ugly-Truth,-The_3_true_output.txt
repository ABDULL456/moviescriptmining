JONAH It's like she's in his brain! 
116   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    116 
Mike pushes through the crowd of balloon lovers. 
117   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    117 
Abby continues her impassioned tirade. 
ABBY Even if they have a moment in a hotel elevator that's totally romantic and filled with potential, men are completely incapable of copping to it. Because men are weak. 
MIKE (O.S.) Let me tell you something about women. 
She turns to see -- 
MIKE standing there. He pushes past Joy and climbs into the balloon. Grabbing the mic from Abby's hand. 
ABBY Hey -- 
MIKE (ignoring her; to camera) Women would have us believe that they are the victims. They aren't. They want us to think that we break their hearts for sport. That's crap. They say they want romance. They say they want true love, but all they want is a checklist. Is he perfect? Is he handsome? Is he a doctor? 
118   INT. KPHX - CONTROL ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS                      118 
A confused Cliff looks at Stuart, who's still on the phone. 
CLIFF I thought he quit. 
(CONTINUED) 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 118   CONTINUED:                                                    118 
STUART (now elated; into phone) See? I told you she'd get him back. 
119   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                 119 
Abby glares at Mike. 
ABBY That is not true. 
BY THE CAMERAMAN, Joy shrugs. 
JOY Well, kinda true. 
Mike continues his rant. 
MIKE You men that fit the criteria -- don't kid yourselves. They're not sleeping with you. They're sleeping with a carefully calculated set of venal choices. Money over substance. Looks over soul. Polish over principles. No gesture, no matter how real or romantic, will ever compensate for a really impressive list of credentials. 
ABBY Says the man who's never made a gesture except for this one -- 
She makes the universally known "jack-off" hand gesture. 
MIKE So, the elevator wasn't a gesture? 
ABBY The elevator was a moment of passion, followed by a moment of panic on your part, apparently. 
120   INT. KPHX - CONTROL ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS                   120 
Stuart looks at Cliff. 
STUART What elevator? 'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 
121   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                 121 
Mike glares at Abby. 
MIKE I came by your room! 
ABBY And then you ran away. 
MIKE Well, that wasn't panic, sweetheart. It was an unwillingness to compete with the walking checklist that was in your bed. You should be thanking me. 
NEARBY, Joy taps her watch. 
JOY We have ten seconds. 
An OVERZEALOUS BALLOON PILOT walks up. 
PILOT Are we ready to soar up, up and away? 
IN THE BASKET, Mike looks at the camera. 
MIKE And that's the Ugly Truth, folks. A girl in heat for two guys will always pick the one with the better resume. 
BEHIND HIM, the Pilot silently boards the balloon. 
ABBY That is bullsh -- 
The TORCH of the BALLOON is suddenly fired, covering her FBC violation. 
The cameraman follows the balloon as it slowly starts to rise.

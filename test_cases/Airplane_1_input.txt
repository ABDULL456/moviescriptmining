CAREY You do? Who is it? 
We hear A THUNK. REAR PROJECTION shows he has run oyer a bicyclist, who stands and gives the finger. 
KRAMER His name is Ted Striker. I flew with him during the war. And that won't make my job any easier tonight. 
REAR PROJECTION SPEEDS UP to obvious FAST MOTION. 
KRAMER Ted Striker was a crack flight leader up to a point. But he was one of those men who, well, let's just say he felt too much inside. Maybe you know the kind. 
Now REAR PROJECTION indicates car is turning and then weaving, but Kramer does not move wheel. 
KRAMER It takes a certain type to perform under pressure. Striker didn't have it. 
By now REAR PROJECTION is cowboys and Indians on horseback chasing and shooting at Kramer's car. 
KRAMER Ate his heart out over every name on the casualty lists. The upshot of it is that he went all to pieces on one particular mission. Let's just hope it doesn't happen again tonight.

ELAINE Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane! 
STRIKER That's what I've been trying to tell these people. 
DR. RUMACK Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got. 
STRIKER Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights. 
He flips a switch. The plane dives.

MUDDY It's that Candy, too... 
Then comes Mr. Rose, slyly smiling, taking it all in--there's no hiding what's going on. Homer and Candy are caught, their shirts untucked and half-unbuttoned--they're still out of breath. The pillows lie crazily on the beds, each one of which has been stepped on. 
MR. ROSE Don't this place look like home? 
PEACHES It look nicer then home! 
MR. ROSE What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice? 
Rose Rose enters. She looks hardened, toughened--not happy. She plops down her stuff on her bed, looking only at Candy. 
ROSE ROSE How is that Wally doing? 
CANDY Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places... 
Homer tries to help out. 
HOMER (mumbling) ...bridges, oil refineries, fuel depots... 
He peters out, knowing how sick of hearing this Candy is. He tries to change the subject. 
HOMER Where's Jack? 
There is an uncomfortable silence. 
MUDDY He just wasn't up for the trip. 
More silence. 
MR. ROSE That Jack just never knew what his business was. 
One look at Muddy and we know something pretty bad happened to Jack. 
EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY 
The pickers on their ladders, all picking. Homer is now a good picker; he looks over at Rose Rose. She is slumped against the ladder, not picking, completely ignoring an argument beneath them in the aisle between the trees. (Mr. Rose is checking over the apples Peaches has just picked.) 
MR. ROSE You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that. 
PEACHES They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree! 
MR. ROSE Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider. 
EXT. ORCHARDS - DUSK 
In the aisle between the trees, Homer and Candy are arguing in one of the work vehicles. 
CANDY Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally? 
HOMER So we should "wait and see." For how long? 
CANDY I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him. 
HOMER Fine. That's all there is to it then. 
CANDY No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do. 
HOMER Okay, okay--I know you do, too. 
CANDY (bitterly) It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it? 
Her sudden hardness leaves him speechless as they go their separate ways. Candy drives on. 
EXT. CIDER HOUSE - SUNNY MORNING 
Breakfast time at the picnic table. Rose Rose by herself, away from the table. She does not look well; she suddenly goes back inside the bunkhouse. 
PEACHES (calling after her) Ain't you eatin' with us, Rose? (to the men) She used to eat with us. Now we ain't good enough for her, I guess. 
HERO She ain't hungry, maybe. 
MUDDY She ain't hungry every mornin' 'cause she's sick every mornin'. 
Homer gets up to take his dishes inside. 
INT. KITCHEN AND BUNKHOUSE - MORNING 
When Homer comes in, Rose Rose is throwing up in the sink. 
HOMER You okay, Rose? 
ROSE ROSE I guess you must like watchin' me be sick... 
HOMER I don't like watching anyone be sick. 
Rose Rose lies down on her bed with the curtain open. There is something familiar about the way Homer approaches her bedside; he does so with the authority of a doctor. He sits on the edge of her bed with such complete self-assurance that she doesn't protest. 
HOMER How many months are you? 
She just stares. But she doesn't stop him when he touches her abdomen. It's as if she knows that he knows what he's doing.

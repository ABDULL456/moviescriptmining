Another aspect of the dog's being affected by the Haunting, could be for the family to see it roll over on its back, as if it is being tickled on the tummy; and without anything obviously petting it, he wags his right leg, the common reaction of most dogs when being tickled above the abdomen. 
One possible ending for NIGHT TIME could be the evacuation of the town by the townspeople. As we slowly pan through the empty town and its deserted homes, we see ghost fires being lit. The town burns, TV sets imploding; the burial ground has not been consecrated, and the souls are set to rest in peace.

CADEN God. You're just perfect. 
HAZEL I'm a mess. But we fit, don't we. They kiss, then Hazel climbs into bed. 
CADEN It doesn't always happen for me now. Because of the medication and everything. I take a lot of pills. 
HAZEL I don't care. It's okay.

CADEN (climbing into bed) I'm embarrassed. I just want you to know it's not you. And it's not me. It's the medication. They are tender and quiet and intensely focused. The smoke in the room is dense. When it's over, they lie there quietly, with the occasional cough from both of them. Caden cries quietly. 
CADEN (CONT'D) I'm sorry. 
HAZEL It's okay. It's different crying this time. I can tell. I'm crying, too. And I cried last time. After you left. I never told you. But I cried, too. Caden kisses her again. 
CADEN I have a title. The Obscure Moon Lighting an Obscure World. 
HAZEL I think it might be too much. 
171INT. BURNING HOUSE - KITCHEN - 2035 - MORNING171 
Caden agitatedly paces through the dense smoke. He passes a scrapbook on the table. It's open to a page with ripped-up napkin pieces glued to it. He's crying hard. There's mumbling, quiet conversation coming from somewhere. He walks into -- 
172INT. BURNING HOUSE - BEDROOM - 2035 - CONTINUOUS 172 
Hazel lies in bed. A medic hovers over her, swabs in her mouth and pulls out cotton black with soot. 
MEDIC Might be smoke inhalation. Caden just nods his head for a long time. 
173INT. CADEN'S CAR - 2041 - DAY173 
Caden drives. He stops at a school crossing as a group of young children are led across the street in front of his car. A young girl with red hair is among them.

MARIA Olive wants to see you. God knows why; the way you abandoned her. 
CADEN MARIA Oh, shut up.She's had a fucked-up life with issues, thanks to you. 
CADEN MARIA You're insane.She's dying, asshole. Is that insane enough for you? 
MARIA (CONT'D) Anyway, she wants to say goodbye to you. God knows the fuck why. 
174 INT. NYC HOSPITAL ROOM - 2041 - DAY 174 
Maria leads Caden into the room. Olive, 40, lies in bed, emaciated and pale. Maria and Olive speak only in German. 
MARIA OLIVE Hello, darling. Hi. 
MARIA This is him. 
OLIVE CADEN Hello.Hi, Olive. I've missed you so much. 
OLIVE Maria, would you leave us? Maria kisses Olive again on the forehead. 
MARIA In heaven, my darling. Maria exits. 
OLIVE (broken English) Forgive me but no longer remember English. Speak German?

CADEN OLIVE No. I'm sorry.I had hope you have learned. Weakly, Olive points to a headset on her night table. She pantomimes putting it on. Caden puts it on. Olive puts on her own. There follows a slightly delayed and staticky translation, in an accented male voice, of everything Olive says, with a delay between what Caden says and Olive's response, as she listens in translation. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) I'm dying, as I'm sure Maria told you. The flower tattoos have become infected and they're dying. So I am, as well. This is life. Olive pulls down her hospital gown a bit to show Caden the now sickly and decayed flower tattoos. 
CADEN It's Maria. She did this. 
OLIVE Maria gave me reason to live once you left. The flowers defined me. 
CADEN Your mother and Maria took you away. I tried for years to find you. I didn't leave you. 
OLIVE You did something. Caden is affected by this. It resonates. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) I want to talk to you about your homosexuality. 
CADEN What? I'm not a homosexual! 
OLIVE Maria said you would deny it. 
CADEN She's lying to you. 
OLIVE I had the same struggle when I first fell in love with Maria and we began to have dirty, aching sex.

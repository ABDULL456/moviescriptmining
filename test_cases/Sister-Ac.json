THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR. \nAs they sing, their moves and gestures are carefully choreographed in vintage girl group style. \nPage 7. \nA lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the number.  While Christy does her best, her singing voice is not on a par with those of the other Ronelles. \nThe lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few drunken Shriners and a couple of college kids.  POLICE LIEUTENANT EDDIE MULCAHY sits at a ringside table with his eyes locked on Christy.  An easygoing charmer, Eddie gives her a wink, but she responds with an up-yours look and a turn to the other half of the room as the song continues. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER \nA small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a sputtering fan for ventilation.  Christy has her own dressing table and mirror, and the Ronelles share a table a few feet away.  Clothing and costumes hang on nails or are draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear. \nCHRISTY Screw this dump.  It's a roach motel with sequins.  Every guy I meet is either married, a cop, or a lush from Des Moines. \nMICHELLE But what about us? \nTINA You taught us the act.  The songs, all the moves. \nCHRISTY And where did it get me?  I'm stuck in this rathole!  You're holding me back, just like Vince!  I should be headlining! \nA pock-faced weasel of a man named JOEY opens the door and leans into the room. \nCHRISTY What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost! \nJOEY You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen. \nCHRISTY Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road. \nJoey takes a step into the room and sets a box on the chair near Christy. \nJOEY From Vince. \nPage 8. \nCHRISTY His ashes? \nJOEY With love. \nJoey leaves.  Michelle and Tina hover around the box, very excited.  They pick it up, trying to tempt Christy. \nMICHELLE From Vince! With love! \nTINA Michelle and Tina can't restrain themselves: they open the box.  Inside is a rather gaudy fur coat.  Michelle and Tina are impressed. \nMICHELLE It's a fur! \nTINA It's new! \nCHRISTY It's a bribe.  Five years of my goddamned life! \nMICHELLE So you earned it! \nTINA Vince owns the casino!  Cash in \nCHRISTY I should throw this in his facet \nThere's a KNOCK on the door, and Tina opens it. Lieutenant Eddie Mulcahy enters.  Christy is not pleased. \nCHRISTY Oh, Jesus.  What is going on here? (to heaven) Why me?  Whose dog did I kill? \nMICHELLE Hi, Lieutenant. \nTINA Hello, Eddie. \nEddie picks up the coat. \nEDDIE From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang. \nCHRISTY At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift. \nEDDIE I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other. \nCHRISTY Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron? \nEDDIE So I don't shop. \nCHRISTY 'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard! \nEDDIE Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker! \nMICHELLE Calm down, you two.  It's always like this. \nEDDIE Yeah, well, now, she goes out with a' better class of people.  Vince Laflocca. \n", "test1_true": "EDDIE A what? When are you qonna wake up? \nCHRISTY When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills? \nEDDIE Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience. \nCHRISTY Think again!  And get out of here. \nPage 10. \nEDDIE I'm going.  My regards to Vince,   And the Mrs. \nChristy hurls a jar of cold cream at Eddie's head.  He ducks, and the jar hits the door. \nEDDIE Ladies. \nEddie leaves.  Christy is standing, absolutely furious. \nCHRISTY That's it!  I'm not taking it from him, and I'm not taking it from Vince!  From now on, it's all about me!  And if I can't spend it, drink it, or sleep with it -- it's gone.  Like Sister Immaculata used to say, \"Life is short, and then you fry.\"  So long, girls -- see you in church! \nChristy grabs the mink and heads out the door. \nINT. VINCE'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nERNIE SCHMIDT sits across the enormous mahogany desk from Vince.  The young man's throat is dry; he's sweating bullets.  The presence of Joey the weasel and WILLY, a brutal thug, increases Ernie's tension. \nVINCE Ernie Schmidt.  How long you been with us, Ernie Schmidt? \nERNIE Three years, Mr. LaRocca.  One behind the bar, two as croupier. \nVince gestures to the lush office and its furnishings. \nVINCE Ernie, you know what's important to me? What counts?  It's not all this.  This is '-- what?  Frosting.  Loyalty.  That's me, Ernie.  That's home. \nVince gestures to Joey, who takes out a revolver and points it at Ernie's head. \nVINCE You ain't been loyal, Ernie.  What did you tell the cops? \nErnie's eyes open wide with denial as the gun comes closer to his temple. \nPage 11. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY \nHolding the coat, Christy waits by the elevator.  It arrives; she gets in. \nINT. VINCE'S OFFICE \nThe interrogation continues. \nERNIE I didn't tell the cops anything. I swear. \nVINCE Joey? \nJoey slams Ernie on the side of the head with the gun. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nChristy steps out of the elevator and faces a maze of office cubicles with half-wall partitions.  The floor is deserted and dark as she makes her way through the cubicles. \nINT. VINCE'S OFFICE \nVince is standing over Ernie, holding his head up by the hair. \nVINCE Who else, Ernie?  Who else was in on it? \nERNIE (moaning) No one... \nVINCE (dropping Ernie's head in disgust) Why am I wasting my time? \nINT. EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR \nBeyond the cubicles, Christy strides down a lush corridor to an executive suite.  She tries the knob, but finds the door locked.  Pulling a key from her purse, she unlocks the door to the suite and enters a large outer office with a reception area and doors to several inner offices.  She tosses the key onto the receptionist's desk. \nCHRISTY Won't need that anymore.  Ta-ta. \nCrossing to Vince's office, Christy squares her shoulders and narrows her eyes with anger as she reaches for the doorknob.  She pauses for a second, and then doubles her resolve. \nPage 12. \nINT. VINCE'S OFFICE \nVINCE Do it. (to Joey) \nANGLE on the door to the office, which opens.  Christy appears, with the mink coat in her arms. \nCHRISTY Stuff this up your... \nA GUNSHOT is heard, 0.S.  Christy's eyes widen, and her jaw drops, at what she has just witnessed. \nANGLE on the office.  Ernie is slumped in the chair, dead. Joey stands over him, holding the revolver.  Joey, Willy and Vince stare at Christy. \nVINCE Babe.

REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY \nThe rehearsal room is filled with high energy as the choir is separated into several groups.  Christy has got the whole thing running like a disciplined Broadway cast. \nMary Patrick leads one group in the corner as they practice synchronized movements with tambourines.  Colorful streamers are tied to the tambourines, and they make colorful patterns in the air. \nSister Alma pounds the piano with newfound energy, as Mary Robert and the sopranos reach higher and higher for notes they've only dreamed of in the past. \nChristy and Mary Lazarus have corralled the rest of the nuns into a practice of intricate dance steps, somewhat like the Temptations in skirts.  Mary Lazarus keeps the beat with a yardstick. \nCHRISTY Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again! \nMARY LAZARUS Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn! \nCHRISTY Hopeless I \nMARY LAZARUS Amateurs 2 \nCHRISTY Babies \nMARY LAZARUS Again! \nEXT. CRACK HOUSE - NIGHT \nOne of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as a car suddenly pulls up to the curb.  He starts toward the car as the DRIVER rolls down the window, but before he gets there, Christy and several nuns surround the car. \nPage 75. \nCHRISTY We're here to pray for you, brother. \nDEALER What?  Get the hell out of here. \nCHRISTY We know you don't want to sell drugs. You just had an unhappy childhood, and maybe a learning disability.  You just need someone to pray for you. \nMARY PATRICK We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work. \nCHRISTY And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers. \nDRIVER What is this?  Outta my way! \nThe nuns give him room, and the Driver zips off down the street.  A small crowd has begun to gather, and it is growing by the moment, murmuring encouragement for the nuns.  Christy turns to the Dealer, as other cars drive slowly past. \nCHRISTY Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house. \nMARY ROBERT (to the Dealer) We're nuns! \nMARY PATRICK (to cruising cars) Free prayers right over here!  Drive up and get your prayers! \nDEALER You're hassling my customers!  That's not legal!  I know my rights.  This is restriction of trade. \nCHRISTY You wanna call a cop? \nPage 76. \nThe Dealer's eyes turn ugly as he takes a gun from his pocket.  Mary Patrick steps forward. \nMARY PATRICK Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy? \nMARY LAZARUS Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here. \nCHRISTY (to the crowd) Can I get a witness? \nThe Dealer glances at the surly crowd, then gives the nuns a disgusted look.  He puts the gun away. \nDEALER So I'll find another neighborhood to do my business.  You can' t stop me. \nCHRISTY If we can stop you here, they can stop you there. \nThe Dealer turns and walks back to his house with anger. The crowd APPLAUDS and CHEERS. \nThe picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice of a NEWS REPORTER. \nNEWS REPORTER (V.0.) It was a truly remarkable scene, as the nuns from St. Katherine's literally drove the crack dealers from the neighborhood, led by the feisty Sister Mary Clarence. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK and we see a TV screen with an image of the nuns and neighbors still celebrating.  On top of the TV are several framed photographs of Vince Laflocca, his wife and children. \nINT. VINCE LaROCCA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCONNIE LaROCCA, Vince's wife, watches the TV NEWS STORY and calls to Vince in the kitchen. \nCONNIE Vinnie, get in here.  You gotta see this! \nCarrying a roast beef sandwich and a can of beer, Vince appears from the kitchen and glances at the TV screen to see a shot of the convent.  He looks at Connie and makes a sour face. \nPage 77. \n", "test2_true": "Vince turns away from the TV just as a closeup of Christy appears on the screen. \nCONNIE Look -- she's adorable! \nVince leaves the room, and we see Christy again as she leads the choir. \nINT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nEddie is cooking spaghetti in his efficiency apartment and watching the NEWS on TV at the same time.  He pours himself a glass of wine and stirs the spaghetti sauce. \nNEWS REPORTER This tiny convent has experienced an amazing turnaround.  The sisters have revitalized and taken back their neighborhood, all due to the energy and talent of the convent choir, a group led by this gifted young nun.  Tell us, Mary Clarence1 what makes you so special? \nCHRISTY (trying to appear modest and nun-like) Oh, I'm not special, Bob.  It's just hard work... and prayer. \nEddie all but spits out his wine.  His eyes are wide as he watches Christy being interviewed.  In one stride, he grabs his hat and coat and is out the door on the run. \nEXT. CONVENT - DAY \nThe Sunday morning bell is CHIMING as crowds of people stream into the convent.  The entire neighborhood looks cleaner, and the people walk with a spring in their step. Three local TV stations have remote news crews on the scene doing follow-ups on the story. \nINT. CHAPEL HALLWAY \nLast in line, Christy follows the other choir members down a hallway toward the chapel.  Suddenly, a hand reaches out and grabs her, and a second hand covers her mouth as she is pulled into an empty cell. \nINT. CELL \nShocked and terrified, Christy struggles to free herself, but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is Eddie. \nPage 78. \nEddie releases her, and she falls onto the bed. \nCHRISTY Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me! \nEDDIE What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV? \nCHRISTY It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent. \nEDDIE You're supposed to be hiding out! \nCHRISTY I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do. \nEDDIE Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity. \nCHRISTY I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them. \nEDDIE Jesus, look at you   You're glowing. \nCHRISTY I am? \nEDDIE Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it.. \nCHRISTY (flirting) Really?  Lieutenant? \nEDDIE I've been worried about you. \nEddie sits on the bed beside Christy. \nCHRISTY You mean -- worried about my testimony? \nEDDIE No -- worried about you.  Personally. \nPage 79. \nCHRISTY Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun. \nEDDIE Me too. \nCHRISTY You're not... seeing anybody? \nEDDIE No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed. \nCHRISTY I have? \nEDDIE You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different... \nEddie and Christy are gazing into each other's eyes; they are just about to kiss.  Their lips are less than an inch apart. \nEDDIE You're... you're a nun. \nEddie and Christy jump apart, their intimacy has frightened them both, particularly given Christy's outfit, and their location. \nCHRISTY We're in a convent! \nChristy goes to the door. \nCHRISTY I've got to go. \nEDDIE Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.? \nCHRISTY (trying to think straight) I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try. \nChristy begins to leave, and then she turns, filled with a performer's excitement. \nCHRISTY Magic time! \n", "test2_id": 1795, "test3_input": "MOTHER SUPERIOR A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party. \n(MORE) \nPage 86. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D) You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate. \nCHRISTY Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence. \nCHRISTY But... \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Good day. \nChristy, frustrated, leaves the room.  Mother Superior looks up, she is truly torn, a proud woman unsure of her choices. \nEXT. CONVENT - NIGHT \nThe moon casts shafts of silver light down to the courtyard of the convent.  Most of the lights in the neighborhood are out at this late hour. \nCHRISTY'S VOICE (whispering) Come on... I've got a surprise... \nINT. CONVENT KITCHEN - NIGHT \nThe kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle carried by Christy.  Three more candles appear, carried by Mary Robert, Mary Patrick and Mary Lazarus.  The door to the freezer opens, and light spills out.  Christy removes several pints of ice cream and distributes them to the nuns. \nMARY ROBERT (delighted) Ice cream! \nMARY PATRICK Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this? \nMARY LAZARUS It's a sin.  It's a wicked indulgence. Is this butter almond? \nPage 87. \nChristy and the nuns sit on stools, enjoying their ice cream by candlelight. \nCHRISTY It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift. \nMARY ROBERT A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking. \nMARY LAZARUS Is there any syrup? \nCHRISTY Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up. \nMARY ROBERT Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes. \nMARY PATRICK Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us. \nMARY LAZARUS We could cut a demo.  Look for a label. \nCHRISTY (knowing she has to leave) That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow. \nMARY ROBERT (worried) Are you leaving us? \nCHRISTY (sincerely) Oh no.  We'll always be together. \nMARY LAZARUS That's what Diana Ross said. \nPage 88. \nChristy and the nuns qiggle, and continue eating their ice cream, in a spirit of true friendship. \nMother Superior watches this scene, hidden in the shadows by the door to the kitchen.  She has begun to see Christy in a new light.  She looks thoughtful, and walks off. \nINT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY \nTate sits at his desk in the detective room, reading the sports section.  HENRY PARKER, the accountant for the police department, looks stressful as he enters the room and heads for Eddie's glassed-in office.  Tate glances up as Parker passes his desk. \nTATE You're too late.  Mulcahy just left. \nPARKER I need his signature on some things. They can't be processed without it. \nTATE Leave 'em.  He'll sign 'em later. \nParker looks annoyed -- he doesn't like deviations from procedure -- but after a moment of indecision, he sets the file folder on Tate's desk and walks away. \nTate finishes the newspaper and shoves it aside.  Bored, looks at his watch, then flips the file folder open and glances at its contents;  routine money vouchers for equipment, supplies, etc.  Tate is about to close the folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye. \nTATE What the hell is this...? \nHe examines a money voucher for a generous donation to St. Katherine's Convent in San Francisco.  It only takes a moment to put two and two together, and Tate scrambles for his phone and dials a number. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nHenry Parker waits for the elevator.  When it opens, he's surprised to see Eddie step out. \nPARKER Tate said you were gone. \nEDDIE I get all the way down to my car, and, of course -- where are the keys? \nPage 89. \nPARKER I left the money vouchers with him.  He said you'd sign them in the morning. \n", "test3_true": "INT. VINCE'S OFFICE \nVince is on the telephone.  He signals Joey and Willy, and they move quickly toward him. \nVINCE This is it.

Give me the address. \nVince begins to write down the address. \nINT. SQUAD ROOM \nTate is hunched over the telephone, talking quietly with his back to the rest of the room.  The voucher for St. Katherine's is in his hand as Eddie moves quickly toward him. \nTATE St. Katherine's Convent on East Barton. It's gotta be the place. \nTate hangs up the phone and BOOM!  Eddie hits him from behind like a linebacker, drilling him to the floor.  Other detectives look up from their desks with confusion and alarm.  Eddie pins Tate to the wall and snatches the voucher from his hand. \nEDDIE You're the leak, you son-of-a-bitch! \nClarkson and another detective restrain Eddie before he can hit Tate. \nEDDIE Get him out of here!  Downstairs, in the cell!  I want his ass locked up now! \nNobody dares even question Eddie at this moment, and two detectives drag Tate away.  Eddie grabs Tate's phone and dials long distance. \nEDDIE Clarkson, get on the other line.  Call Frisco Central.  Tell 'em to get two squad cars outside St. Katherine's convent, and stop anybody with an out-of- state license plate from getting near the place. \nClarkson dials quickly.  Eddie listens to Tate's telephone as it RINGS and RINGS and RINGS. \nINT. CONVENT - DAY \nAll the nuns are in the chapel as the choir rehearses a hymn, along with Gina and her girlfriends.  Those who are not in the choir clap their hands in rhythm.  War in the background, we can hear the telephone RINGING. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nEddie's police car streaks past an entrance ramp with the SIREN screaming.  It blazes through traffic, weaving in and out at breakneck speeds.  A moment later, Joey and Willy pull onto the highway at a fast rate.  The race is on, with Eddie securely in the lead. \nINT. CONVENT - DAY \nIn the rehearsal room, the choir members are putting on their robes.  Christy and several nuns are all trying to primp in front of one small mirror. \nMARY ROBERT The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words? \nCHRISTY Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus? \nMARY PATRICK It should be here any minute. \nMARY LAZARUS (with a clipboard) Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.

KATE'S - THE GREATEST!\", \"GOOD LUCK TONIGHT!\" \nA Catholic school bus pulls up to the convent and parks in front.  Several nuns in choir robes come outside and hurry onto the bus.  A moment later, Eddie's police car streaks up to the side entrance of the convent, parking around the corner from the bus. \nINT.

Let's go! \nEveryone makes a final check of their appearance, and then the group leaves the room to head for the bus.  Mary Robert and Mary Patrick are the last to leave, except for Christy. \nMARY PATRICK Hurry, Sister! \nCHRISTY Get moving.  I'm right behind you. \nChristy primps in the mirror one last time, then leaves the room.

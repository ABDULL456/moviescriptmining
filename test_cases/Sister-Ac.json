{"train": "SISTER ACT \nWritten by \nPaul Rudnick \nJuly 19, 1991 \nPage 1. \nSISTER ACT \nFADE IN: \nINT. ST. ANNE'S ACADEMY - AKRON, OHIO - CLASSROOM We are in a parochial school classroom, in the late Sixties.  The children all wear uniforms and sit at little desks.  SISTER IMMACULATA stands at the front of the room; she is a middle-aged nun, very severe.  The children are all terrified of her. \nSISTER IMMACULATA Who can name all the Apostles?  Yes? \nANGLE ON CHRISTINE CARTER \nA thirteen-year-old girl sitting at a desk.  She raises her hand. \nSISTER IMMACULATA Christine? \nCHRISTINE Sister, may I be excused? \nSISTER IMMACULATA Christine... \nCHRISTINE It's an emergency.  Real bad. \nSister Immaculata nods, pursing her lips.  Christine stands and heads for the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GIRLS ROOM \nChristine is now in the deserted St. Anne's girls room. She is standing on tiptoes, looking in the mirror.  She has taken her hair out of its neat barrettes; she is combing it out.  She applies lipstick. \nChristine reaches into her schoolbag; she pulls out a stack of glittery bracelets and slips them on.  She unbuttons the top few buttons of her stiff white blouse. She sprays herself with dime store cologne. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HALLWAY \nChristine opens the girls' room door; she looks both ways. No one is around; she saunters down the hall. \nPage 2. \nANGLE ON A DOOR MARKED BROOM CLOSET Christine opens this door.  She looks into the closet. There is a very nervous thirteen-year-old BOY waiting for her inside. \nCHRISTINE Hi, Jimmy. \nChristine slips inside the closet and closes the door behind her. \nANGLE ON SISTER IMMACULATA \nStriding down the hall, with a bloodthirsty look in her eye, and a nasty-looking wooden ruler in her hand.  She flings open the broom closet door, \nANGLE ON CHRISTINE AND JIMMY \nin the broom closet.  Jimmy's face is covered with lipstick.  Christine's hair is awry.  The couple has clearly been making out. \nSISTER IMMACULATA (outraged) Miss Christine Carter!  Again!  Don't you know what happens to girls like you? Don't you know what they become? \nINT. CHRISTY'S APARTMENT - ANGLE ON A LARGE, TATTERED POSTER-NIGHT (TODAY) \nTaped over a crack on a wall.  The poster shows a glittering CHRISTY VAN CARTIER:  singing star of a fifth- rate Vegas lounge.  Christy wears tight spangles and a major wig on the poster.  She has clearly lived up, or down, to all of Sister Immaculata's expectations. \nThe CAMERA PANS through the dark bedroom in which the poster hangs; a neon sign flashes outside the window, casting a red and blue haze over the premises.  A dressing room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail polish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry are scattered everywhere. \nWe hear the movement of BED SPRINGS as someone sits up in the dark. \nCHRISTY'S VOICE Come on, Vince -- hold me a minute. \nVINCE'S VOICE I'd love to. babe -- but I've got to go. It was great.  Like usual. \nCHRISTY'S VOICE It was twenty minutes.  Like usual. \nPage 3. \nVINCE'S VOICE The best. \nVINCE LAROCCA stands at the mirror, adjusting his clothing and checking his hair.  Vince is a powerful, charismatic man who rules an organized crime empire with personal magnetism and threat.  Vince's hold over Christy is obvious, if unfortunate; he can seem expansive and generous one minute, ruthless and dangerous the next. \nVINCE (half to Christy, half to the mirror) You are something else. \nChristy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette. \nCHRISTY Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say? \nVINCE What did who say? \nCHRISTY Who?  The other woman.  Your wife. \nVince turns to face Christy, turning on the charm. \nRONELLES Oh my! (sighing) \nCHRISTY He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's... \nRONELLES Yes, Betty? \nCHRISTY (singing) HE'S SO FINE. \nRONELLES D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG. \nCHRISTY WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR. \nAs they sing, their moves and gestures are carefully choreographed in vintage girl group style. \nPage 7. \nA lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the number.  While Christy does her best, her singing voice is not on a par with those of the other Ronelles. \nThe lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few drunken Shriners and a couple of college kids.  POLICE LIEUTENANT EDDIE MULCAHY sits at a ringside table with his eyes locked on Christy.  An easygoing charmer, Eddie gives her a wink, but she responds with an up-yours look and a turn to the other half of the room as the song continues. \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER \nA small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a sputtering fan for ventilation.  Christy has her own dressing table and mirror, and the Ronelles share a table a few feet away.  Clothing and costumes hang on nails or are draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear. \nCHRISTY Screw this dump.  It's a roach motel with sequins.  Every guy I meet is either married, a cop, or a lush from Des Moines. \nMICHELLE But what about us? \nTINA You taught us the act.  The songs, all the moves. \nCHRISTY And where did it get me?  I'm stuck in this rathole!  You're holding me back, just like Vince!  I should be headlining! \nA pock-faced weasel of a man named JOEY opens the door and leans into the room. \nCHRISTY What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost! \nJOEY You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen. \nCHRISTY Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road. \nJoey takes a step into the room and sets a box on the chair near Christy. \nJOEY From Vince. \nPage 8. \nCHRISTY His ashes? \nJOEY With love. \nJoey leaves.  Michelle and Tina hover around the box, very excited.  They pick it up, trying to tempt Christy. \nMICHELLE From Vince! With love! \nTINA Michelle and Tina can't restrain themselves: they open the box.  Inside is a rather gaudy fur coat.  Michelle and Tina are impressed. \nMICHELLE It's a fur! \nTINA It's new! \nCHRISTY It's a bribe.  Five years of my goddamned life! \nMICHELLE So you earned it! \nTINA Vince owns the casino!  Cash in \nCHRISTY I should throw this in his facet \nThere's a KNOCK on the door, and Tina opens it. Lieutenant Eddie Mulcahy enters.  Christy is not pleased. \nCHRISTY Oh, Jesus.  What is going on here? (to heaven) Why me?  Whose dog did I kill? \nMICHELLE Hi, Lieutenant. \nTINA Hello, Eddie. \nEddie picks up the coat. \nEDDIE From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang. \nCHRISTY At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift. \nEDDIE I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other. \nCHRISTY Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron? \nEDDIE So I don't shop. \nCHRISTY 'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard! \nEDDIE Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker! \nMICHELLE Calm down, you two.  It's always like this. \nEDDIE Yeah, well, now, she goes out with a' better class of people.  Vince Laflocca. \nVINCE Christy.  Is there a problem?  With the coat? \nChristy glances around the room; she doesn't move.  She quickly sizes up the situation.  She tries to appear matter-of-fact. unaffected by what she's just seen. \nCHRISTY No... it's fine. \nVINCE Yes? \nCHRISTY Thanks.  A lot. \nVINCE Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me? \nCHRISTY Sure. \nVINCE And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten. \nCHRISTY (catching the subtext) Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten. \nPage 13. \nVince crosses the room, to Christy.  He takes her hands in his, and kisses them. \nVINCE That's my girl.  My girl in mink.  Will you be home?  Soon? \nChristy kisses Vince, quickly. \nCHRISTY Right.  I'll be... at the apartment. Call me.  Thanks.  Again. \nChristy reaches for the doorknob, without looking at the door.  She fumbles a bit.  She finds the door. \nCHRISTY Mink.  Wow. \nChristy walks backwards, out the door.  She turns; she is gone. \nJOEY Vince -- is she... okay? \nVINCE Maybe. (considering this) \nWILLY I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset. \nVINCE She did. (making a decision) Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk. \nJOEY And if she runs? \nVINCE (icy) Take care of it. \nWith guns drawn, Willy and Joey run after Christy. \nINT. RECEPTION AREA \nChristy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from Vince's office.  She passes through a glass door which leads to the cubicle area. \nLONG SHOT of the cubicle area, which resembles a darkened maze.  Christy hears Joey approaching; she runs into the cubicle area. \nJOEY Christy?  He only wants to talk to you! \nPage 14. \nANGLE on Christy, crouched behind a half-wall.  She is clutching the coat. \nWILLY Christy? \nThere is a stuffed toy, a \"Garfield the Cat,\" attached to the wall near Christy, with suction cups.  Christy tries to pull the cat's feet off the wall, very quietly. \nJOEY Christy? \nChristy finally just yanks the cat off the wall.  She hurls it as high and as far as she can, to the opposite end of the room. \nANGLE on the flying stuffed cat. \nJoey sees the blur of the cat; he SHOOTS it, and the cat explodes. \nJOEY Come on, Christy!  There's no place to go! \nChristy steadies herself against a Xerox machine.  She accidentally activates the machine, which lights up and starts HUMMING. \nANGLE on Willy, as he hears the Xerox machine.  He quickly moves toward the SOUND. \nWilly reaches the Xerox machine; the area is deserted.  He starts moving quickly down the aisle   A chair, the kind on casters, comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways; the chair hits Willy and he falls. \nChristy runs out of the cubicle; Willy is on the floor, struggling to get up.  As Christy sprints away, Willy SHOOTS at her.  He misses, but a glass partition SHATTERS. \nChristy runs for an open elevator, but it has been summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to close. She runs even faster.  A BULLET whistles past her ear and hits the back wall of the elevator.  She reaches for the doors a moment too late, and the elevator is gone. \nChristy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs into a stairwell as two more BULLETS bite pieces out of the door. \nINT. STAIRWELL \nTaking the stairs three at a time, Christy is flying, still clutching the mink.  The thugs are gaining on her.  A BULLET hits metal and RICOCHETS off several walls and steps. \nPage 15. \nAt the next landing, Christy opens the door and ducks into a corridor. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nLarry covers his ears with both hands. \nLARRY I can't hear this.  I'm an attorney, Vince, and you're just an honest casino owner.  Object of a witch hunt. Innocent victim. \nVINCE Keep the message vague, but let 'em know.  The price has gone up.  Christy Van Cartier -- a quarter of a million. Dead or nearby. \nVince looks grim and vindictive, as he gets into the car. \nEXT. CONVENT VEGETABLE GARDEN - DAY \nThe vegetable patch is located behind the convent, on a patch of land surrounded by high walls.  Various sections have been partitioned with string and then furrowed. \nSeveral nuns are working in the patch, weeding and raking. They wear large, ungainly straw hats over their wimples. \nChristy has been given a hoe and a straw hat.  She is hacking at the dirt, with great disinterest.  She picks up a carrot from the vegetable patch; she looks around to see if anyone is watching.  She starts to gnaw on the carrot. She becomes aware that someone is watching her.  She looks up. \nSister Mary Robert is watching Christy eat the carrot, breaking her fast.  Christy drops the carrot on the ground, as if it burned her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing in the next furrow over. \nChristy stares at Mary Robert, narrowing her eyes. Christy looks around; all the other nuns are busy at their tasks.  Christy decides that she will try and make Sister Mary  Robert talk.  She picks up the carrot and tosses it at Mary Robert.  Mary Robert jumps.  She waggles a finger at Christy, scolding her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing. \nPage 31. \nChristy is now determined.  She takes her hoe, and tiptoes nearer to Mary Robert.  Very gently, she uses the handle of the floe to lift Mary Robert's skirt, and gooses her. \nMary Robert vips, very loudly.  All the other nuns turn and stare at Mary Robert, scolding her.  Christy waggles her finger at Mary Robert, scolding her. \nChristy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing.  She sees Mother Superior, standing at the end of the furrow.  Mother Superior looks extremely grim; she has not missed anything. \nEXT. SUNSET - THAT NIGHT \nLONG SHOT of the sun going down, ending the nuns' Vow of Silence. \nWe hear Christy SCREAM, O.S. \nINT. CONVENT HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT \nThis hallway is marked by a series of heavy wooden doors with tiny, grilled windows.  These are the cells where the nuns sleep.  Nuns are entering their cells and closing their doors for the night. \nMother Superior glides down the hall, followed by a dusty, bedraggled Christy.  Christy is devouring a slice of brown bread. \nCHRISTY Is this all the food I get? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Yes.  Until breakfast. \nCHRISTY That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines? \nThey stop by a door. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence. \nCHRISTY My what? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Your cell.  Your room. \nINT. CHRISTY'S CELL \nThe door swings open, and Mother Superior and Christy enter.  The room is tiny, with bare plaster walls.  There is a narrow wooden bed, with a thin muslin-covered mattress.  There is a small nightstand and a wooden stool. \nPage 32. \nCHRISTY (looking around) You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions. \nCHRISTY Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Useless distractions. \nCHRISTY (sinking to the bed) It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR And whom would you call? \nCHRISTY Oh, I don't know... Satan? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (not amused) Your cell is more than adequate. \nCHRISTY Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams. \nCHRISTY Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof. \nCHRISTY (indignant) What's wrong with my life? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. (MORE) \nPage 33 \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D) If you're fooling anyone, it's only yourself.  God has brought you here. Take the hint. \nMother Superior leaves. \nAfter the door shuts, Christy stands and looks out the one small window in her cell.  She leans her head against the wall.  She is trying not to think about what Mother Superior has said.  Still, the mess her life has become overwhelms her.  She fights back tears. \nMary Lazarus leaves the bathing room, and the other nuns resume scrubbing themselves.  Christy looks around. \nCHRISTY Anybody got conditioner? \nINT. CHAPEL - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nBishop O'Hara is leading the Sunday mass.  He stands in the pulpit.  The choir nuns stand in a fenced-in area to his left.  The remaining nuns, including Christy and Mother Superior, sit in the first few pews. \nO'HARA We are a small congregation this morning.  Too many mornings.  Something has gone terribly wrong.   Where is faith?  Where is celebration?  Where is everyone?  Still, rather than regret the absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice in the fellowship of those present.  Our choirmistress, Sister Mary Lazarus, has informed me that our choir, while always superior, has been toiling especially hard on this week's selection.  Sister? \nMary Lazarus raises her hand, and the choir begins singing. They sing a traditional hymn, \"Let Thy Thoughts Be Guided.\" As always, their singing is dreadful; they have no tempo or pitch, and the hymn becomes an off-key drone. \nAs the hymn continues, the CAMERA PANS OVER the chapel. Aside from the nuns, it is almost empty; only a few elderly people are in attendance. \nANGLE ON CHRISTY \nsitting with the other nuns.  She is clearly about to fall asleep.  Then the choir hits a particularly horrendous note, and Christy jerks awake.  She immediately tries to assume a pious expression, tilting her head and folding her hands in prayer; she looks like a somewhat demented Sunday School calendar. \nEXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT \nDetective Clarkson gets out of his car and hurries into the police station. \nINT. POLICE STATION \nClarkson crosses the busy room to Eddie's glass-walled office.  Along the way, he signals Detective Tate to follow him. \nPage 37. \nINT. MULCAHY'S OFFICE \nEddie looks up from his desk as the two detectives enter. \nCLARKSON There was a raid on a pawnshop in L.A. this morning.  The place was fencing stolen property.  They found this. \nClarkson gives Eddie a fax sheet, showing a publicity photograph of Christy. \nEDDIE Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world. (reading the fax sheet) Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive. \nTATE Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her? \nEDDIE Where's who? \nTATE You won't even tell us? \nEDDIE I wouldn't even tell the Pope. \nINT. CONVENT SCHOOLROOM - AN HOUR LATER \nA plain whitewashed classroom, with battered student-style desks.  A group of about eight local TEENAGE GIRLS has gathered.  The girls wear extremes of hair, makeup and clothing; they are bored and scruffy, clearly the local bad Girls.  Sister Mary Patrick is leading the class, in her usual perky manner. \nMARY PATRICK Good afternoon, young ladies.  And welcome to our Christian Youth Group. \nThe Girls make grunting noises. \nMARY PATRICK Hi.  I hope we'll have some fun, and maybe learn a little something, too. Now, today's topic is something very up-to- date -- \"Teenage Promiscuity.\"  My. Now, can anyone tell me -- just what is promiscuity? \nANGLE on the Girls, exchanging glances and rolling their eyes. \nPage 38 \nMARY PATRICK Anyone?  Yes? \nMary Patrick points to a Girl in bicycle pants. a bustier and a leather baseball cap.  Her name is Lawanda. \nLAWANDA Uh, it's like, you know, doin' it.  A whole lot.  Till your head falls off. \nMARY PATRICK (blushing) Well, yes.  That is one way to put it. \nMother Superior enters the classroom accompanied by Christy \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Sister Mary Patrick? \nMARY PATRICK Yes? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence? \nCHRISTY Yeah? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood? \nCHRISTY I got it. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (to Mary Patrick) Come, Sister. \nMother Superior and Mary Patrick leave the classroom. Christy now stands at the front of the room.  She is visibly uncomfortable. \nCHRISTY So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about? \nLAWANDA We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity. \nPage 39 \nCHRISTY (after a beat) Really. \nCHARLENE Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin. \nINT. VINCE'S OFFICE - DAY \nVince is on the telephone in his office at the Moonlight Hotel and Casino.  He clearly has a new mistress or two. \nVINCE (very seductive) Baby, you know I do... of course... I feel it too... I'm blushing... can you hold? \nA second telephone RINGS, and Willy answers it.  Vince meanwhile has pushed a button on his phone and is involved in a second romantic call. \nVINCE Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely? \nWILLY It's that call you were expecting, Vince. \nVINCE Can you hold?  Can you try? \nWilly passes the phone to Vince. t \nPage 43 \nVINCE Have you found out where Christy is yet? Hey, bozo, you re on my payroll! You want to try making it on a cop's salary?  Find her, and find her now! \nVince passes the phone back to Willy. \nVINCE Raise the ante to three hundred grand. \nWilly heads for the fax machine.  Vince regains his composure, and picks up his own phone; he pushes a button. \nVINCE Sorry, baby... you are?  Totally?  Not a stitch?... Yeah, I'm naked too... inside... \nINT. CONVENT CRAFTS ROOM \nThis is a large, open room where the nuns create various gift items which the convent sells to support itself. Several nuns sit at a table, diligently hand-painting Christmas cards and making Christmas tree ornaments. \nOn the other side of the room is a large, free-standing loom, which resembles a grand piano.  The loom is wooden; a tapestry is half-completed.  Mary Patrick is seated at the loom, which is a complicated mechanism.  Christy stands beside her. \nMARY PATRICK The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom? \nCHRISTY Not in years. \nMARY PATRICK Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent. \nCHRISTY Why? \nMARY PATRICK To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money. \nCHRISTY But don't you get money?  From the Vatican? \nPage 44. \nMARY PATRICK Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours. \nCHRISTY Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom. \nMARY PATRICK Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in. (as she deftly works the loom) You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear? \nCHRISTY (pretending to be fascinated) Just about.  Show me again. \nMARY PATRICK You betcha. \nCRAFTS ROOM - AN HOUR LATER \nANGLE on the wall hanging, which has progressed considerably. \nANGLE on Christy, leaning against the wall, thumbing through a magazine. \nANGLE on Mary Patrick, hard at work at the loom. \nMARY PATRICK Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles. \nCHRISTY I love my heddles.  Show me again. \nMother Superior appears. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing? \nMARY PATRICK Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother - \nPage 45. \nCHRISTY Really catching on. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on. \nMother Superior gestures to the loom.  Christy sits at the loom, and waves as Mother Superior and Mary Patrick exit. \nChristy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her face.  She has not been paying attention to Mary Patrick's instructions.  She cracks her knuckles, as if she were about to play the piano.  She grabs two parts of the loom, at random.  She moves these parts. \nANGLE on the loom.  As a result of Christy's movements, the loom collapses, piece by piece.  The tapestry unravels, the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and falls to the floor, as Christy watches, aghast. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nMother Superior is striding down the hall; she is livid. Christy trails behind her, trying to keep up. \nCHRISTY I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver! \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined! \nCHRISTY Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows? \nMary Robert bursts into tears. \nCHRISTY Whoa!  Bob!  What's going on here? What'd I say? \nPage 49. \nMARY ROBERT (still sobbing) You have to help me \nCHRISTY Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer. \nMARY ROBERT No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in? \nCHRISTY Excuse me? \nMARY ROBERT Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me! \nCHRISTY She won't?  Why not? \nMARY ROBERT She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner. \nCHRISTY She said that?  Reverend Mother? \nMary Robert nods, solemnly.  Suddenly, from the streets outside the convent, we hear a BLAST OF hot dance MUSIC, and the SOUND of laughter and carefree conversation. \nCHRISTY Well, then there's only one thing to do. \nMARY ROBERT What? \nCHRISTY Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait. \nChristy stands, and goes to the crucifix hanging on the wall.  She speaks to the crucifix, and listens, as if Jesus is advising her. \nPage 50. \nCHRISTY (to Jesus) Must I do this thing, 0 Lord?  Please help me.,. yes, I know... I must put my selfish cares aside... I must think of others... yes, she's here... (she gestures to Mary Robert) He says hi... yes, I understand... let thy will be done.  Amen.  You too. \nChristy turns to Mary Robert, having received a holy message. \nCHRISTY We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert. \nMARY ROBERT (desperate) Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it? \nCHRISTY (shutting her eyes, for the full spiritual effect) We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place. \nMARY ROBERT Are you sure? \nAnother BLAST OF MUSIC from the street.  Christy turns to the crucifix.  She gets confirmation. \nCHRISTY (to Jesus) We hear you. \nEXT. STREET \nThe outer wall of the convent.  A door swings open, and Christy sticks her head out.  She looks both ways, and steps outside.  She beckons to Mary Robert, who appears from behind her.  Mary Robert looks very wary.  Christy pulls her along. \nEXT. A STREET NEARBY \nChristy and Mary Robert walk along a street a few blocks from the convent. \nMARY ROBERT (looking around cautiously) Are you sure this is what Reverend Mother had in mind? \nPage 51. \nCHRISTY I know it is.  It's life.  Experience. Take a deep breath. \nChristy breathes deep, and then lets out a whoop.  She spins, letting her habit billow around her. \nMARY ROBERT (shocked) Mary Clarence! \nCHRISTY Now you. \nMary Robert's eyes widen.  She points to herself -- \"Me?\" Christy nods.  Mary Robert lets out a tiny little whoop, and does a little, timid hop. \nCHRISTY It's a start. \nEXT. SOCIAL CLUB \nA neighborhood hang-out, the windows bright with neon beer signs.  The exterior is colorfully painted; the club all but explodes with good times.  A group of teenagers lounge on the steps, sipping beers and smoking.  Among the teenagers are the girls from Christy's Christian Youth group.  Christy and Mary Robert approach, and the group falls silent. \nCHRISTY How are you doing. \nLAWANDA (puzzled) Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there? \nCHRISTY You know it. \nMARY ROBERT We need experience. \nCHRISTY (remembering she's a nun) It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over. \nLawanda reluctantly hands over her cigarettes.  Christy turns to a TEENAGE BOY who's drinking beer. \nPage 52. \nCHRISTY And you, with the devil's brew passing through your lips. (holding out her hand) A mind is a terrible thing to waste. \nCHRISTY (to Mary Robert) Run! \nChristy shoves Mary Robert towards an alley.  As she does so, the gun GOES OFF with a red flash.  The shot misses the two women and SHATTERS a plate glass window of the store behind them. \nEXT. ALLEY \nRunning up the alley, Christy and Mary Robert hear Mike's FOOTSTEPS chasing them, growing louder as he gains on them. \nMARY ROBERT Mary Clarence! \nCHRISTY Keep moving! \nChristy grabs the ladder of a fire escape, and shoves Mary Robert up the ladder ahead of her. \nCHRISTY Climb!  Now! \nAs Christy and Mary Robert climb the fire escape, another GUNSHOT ECHOES in the alley, ricocheting off the fire escape. \nThe nuns climb higher up the building.  Mike pursues, looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but not finding any openings.  He takes the steps two at a time and begins to gain ground. \nAt the fourth floor landing, Christy's heel gets stuck in the grating.  She pulls frantically at the laces. \nPage 56. \nCHRISTY Goddamn it! \nMARY ROBERT Mary Clarence! \nMike arrives at the landing just as Christy twists her toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for the gun.  Mike's hand is knocked back against the metal frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, RATTLING down the metal steps to the landing below.  Christy shoves Mary Robert into the open window of an apartment, and follows her in. \nINT. TENEMENT APARTMENT \nChristy and Mary Robert leap into the bedroom of an Hispanic couple, their arms wrapped around each other in bed.  At the women's entrance, the couple looks up, stunned to see two nuns in their bedroom. \nMARY ROBERT Oh my Lord! \nCHRISTY (pushing Mary Robert forward) Experience! \nThe couple continues to look stunned as the nuns race out of the room. \nEXT. CONVENT - NIGHT \nChristy and Mary Robert run up to the side door of the convent; they catch their breath. \nMARY ROBERT What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us? \nCHRISTY I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler. \nMARY ROBERT We could have been killed!  But you saved me! (throwing her arms around Christy) Thank you, Mary Clarence! \nThe door to the convent swings open.  Mother Superior is waiting. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Yes -- thank you so much. \nPage 57 \nINT.CONVENT CORRIDOR - DAY \nChristy sits alone outside Mother Superior's office, listening to the loud TICKING of the clock on the wall. She seems small and vulnerable, like a child sent to the principal's office. \nThe door opens and Eddie emerges from the office. \nCHRISTY What'd she say? \nEDDIE You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back. \nCHRISTY Does she know people are trying to kill me out there? \nEDDIE She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival. \nCHRISTY So what am I supposed to do in the meantime? \nEDDIE Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt. (urging her) Go. \nReluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door.  She looks at Eddie, who motions her to go in.  She finally does. \nINT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE \nMother Superior is working on some papers at her desk as Christy enters.  Christy is trying to figure out a strategy. \nCHRISTY So... hi there. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (not amused and not looking up) I don't believe we have anything to say to each other. \nCHRISTY Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen! \nPage 58. \nMother Superior glances up from her work.  She is justifiably outraged. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable! \nCHRISTY I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at! \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself. \nJOEY A nun! \nINT. CHOIR REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY \nThe choir continues its dreadful rendition of the hymn Let Thy Thoughts He Guided.  Christy is not singing; she is clearly in pain.  Mary Lazarus stops the song.  One of the nuns has to nudge Sister Alma to stop her playing. \nMARY LAZARUS Mary Clarence, are you with us? \nCHRISTY Um, I don't really know this one... \nMARY ROBERT Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said. \nMARY PATRICK (eagerly) Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress? \nCHRISTY Sure.  Kind of... free-lance. \nMARY LAZARUS (circling Christy) Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother. \nCHRISTY What? \nMARY LAZARUS You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old. \nPage 62. \nCHRISTY Hold on. \nMARY PATRICK Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but... (to Christy) Could you help us? \nANOTHER NUN Please? \nANOTHER NUN You've heard us. \nMARY LAZARUS Well. \nEveryone falls silent.  Mary Lazarus walks across the room, eyeballing each member of the choir. \nMARY LAZARUS There's a word for this -- mutiny. (to Christy) So, Mary Clarence, you think you can do better.  I believe I'd like to see that. (she hands Christy her pitchpipe and baton) I'm out to pasture.  Dry dock.  The glue factory.  Go ahead, Sister -- make 'em sing. \nEveryone watches Christy. \nCHRISTY Well... (to Nary Lazarus) With all due respect... let's have a look at this. \nChristy goes over to the piano.  She examines the sheet music for \"Let They Thoughts He Guided.\"  She sits at the piano, beside Sister Alma.  Christy picks out the hymn on the piano, accompanying herself. \nCHRISTY LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED LET THY SOUL BE HEALED \nChristy's singing voice is, as usual, not very good.  She stops singing.  For perhaps the first time in her life, she has really heard herself. \nCHRISTY Man.  I sound like you guys. \nPage 63. \nMARY LAZARUS (victorious) Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to. \nCHRISTY (standing) Mary Robert. \nMary Robert jumps, startled by the attention. \nMARY ROBERT What? \nCHRISTY Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out. \nMARY ROBERT I don't want to mess anyone up... \nCHRISTY (to Sister Alma) Give me a C. (because Sister Alma is hard of hearing) A C! \nSister Alma plays the note.  Christy points the baton at Mary Robert.  Mary Robert whispers the note. \nCHRISTY Louder!  Like you're onstage. \nMary Robert sings a little louder. \nCHRISTY Like people are eating, and there's silverware, and you want them to hear you. \nMary Robert sings louder still. \nCHRISTY Think about that guy you were dancing with! \nMary Robert finally lets out her full voice, which is huge and glorious.  After singing a single perfect note, she stops abruptly; she has scared herself. \nMARY ROBERT Oh my! \nPage 64. \nCHRISTY You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops. \nMARY PATRICK (puzzled) Chops? \nCHRISTY The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos. \nThe two nuns trade places. \nCHRISTY Sister Alma -- a C. \nSister Alma plays the note, and the nuns try to duplicate it, but the results aren't much better than before. Christy uses her pitchpipe; she circulates among the nuns, giving each her note, urging them closer to pitch. \nMother Superior takes one more glance around, then leaves. \nNow that the coast is clear, the singing begins again, quietly, to the rhythm of the machine. \nNUNS GOING TO THE CHAPEL... \nINT. CHAPEL \nBishop O'Hara is leading the Sunday Mass. \nBISHOP O'HARA Welcome this Sunday morning, 0 ye few and faithful. \nPage 68. \nAs usual, the chapel is almost empty, except for the nuns. The choir is in place behind the pulpit. \nBISHOP O'HARA The choir, I am told, has elected a new director -- Sister Mary Clarence, who will lead them in Hymn 127. \nChristy nods to the Bishop, and signals to Sister Alma, who begins the accompaniment. \nCHOIR LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED LET THY SOUL BE HEALED \nThey sound fantastic.  Their voices blend with a heavenly harmony as they sing the slow, melodic hymn.  Mother Superior is startled by this new sound. \nEXT. STREET \nLawanda and her friends glance at the convent with curiosity as the beautiful MUSIC drifts out to the street. A few other heads turn, but with only mild reactions. \nINT. CHAPEL \nAt the end of the first verse, Christy signals the choir to stop.  There's a hush in the chapel as Christy glances at the vacant pews.  Then she turns to Sister Alma and nods. Sister Alma strikes a bold, stirring chord. \nSeveral of the nuns blink.  Bishop O'Hara glances at the organ with surprise.  Mother Superior sits up with a stiffened back and a severe expression. \nAs the chord grows in force, Christy gives the choir a beat. \nCHRISTY One, two, three... \nThe choir begins a radically new version of the same hymn. Christy strides up and down in front of the choir, transforming the song into a rousing gospel anthem, with a passionate call-and-response format. \nCHOIR LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED \nCHRISTY What you say? \nCHOIR LET THY SOUL BE HEALED \nPage 69. \nCHRISTY But how? \nCHOIR BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH \nCHRISTY I think I hear it! \nCHOIR LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED \nCHRISTY You know, I just might! \nCHOIR LET THY SOUL BE HEALED \nCHRISTY AND CHOIR LET THY SPIRIT TAKE WING AND FLY! \nSpontaneous reactions from everyone in the church. \nEXT. STREET \nThe gorgeous, exciting MUSIC pours into the street. Everyone turns to look.  Windows open and people glance out. The street takes on a new movement. \nINT. CHAPEL \nThe choir really lets loose flow. \nCHRISTY AND CHOIR LET THY THOUGHTS BE STRENGTHENED LET THY PRAYERS BE HEARD LET OUR LORD REJOICE IN YOUR PRAISE LET HIS GOODNESS LIFT YOU TO A HIGHER PLACE AND LET LOVE AND PEACE FILL YOUR DAYS \nLawanda and her friends peer in at the back door of the chapel.  Bishop O'Hara sees them, and beckons them to come in. \nCHRISTY Sister Alma! \nSister Alma, inspired by Christy and the choir, burns up the organ with a solo.  More people from the street begin to enter; tentative, curious, drawn by the music. \nAt the end of the solo, Christy makes a gesture to the choir, and each member produces a tambourine.  The chapel is full of energy, music and life. \nCHRISTY Mary Robert! \nPage 70. \nMary Robert sings, really letting the power of her voice ring out.  She is astonishingly good. \nMARY ROBERT LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED LET THY SOUL BE HEALED BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED LET THY SOUL BE HEALED LET THY SOUL TAKE WING AND FLY! \nThe new visitors to the church begin to clap in rhythm to the music, and after a few beats, the nuns join in.  Mother Superior is aghast. \nThe choir builds to a huge gospel finish, all keeping their eyes on Christy. \nCHOIR LET THY SPIRIT \nMARY ROBERT (rapping) HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU \nMARY PATRICK (rapping) BELIEVE IN THE LORD, HIS WILL BE DONE COME TO CHURCH, IT'S TONS OF FUN \nPage 74. \nMARY LAZARUS (rapping) DIG DOWN DEEP, GIVE ALL YOU CAN TRUST ME, CHILDREN, THERE'S A HEAVENLY PLAN! \nThe parade goes on, the crowd gathers, and a general air of jubilance prevails. \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY \nThe rehearsal room is filled with high energy as the choir is separated into several groups.  Christy has got the whole thing running like a disciplined Broadway cast. \nMary Patrick leads one group in the corner as they practice synchronized movements with tambourines.  Colorful streamers are tied to the tambourines, and they make colorful patterns in the air. \nSister Alma pounds the piano with newfound energy, as Mary Robert and the sopranos reach higher and higher for notes they've only dreamed of in the past. \nChristy and Mary Lazarus have corralled the rest of the nuns into a practice of intricate dance steps, somewhat like the Temptations in skirts.  Mary Lazarus keeps the beat with a yardstick. \nCHRISTY Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again! \nMARY LAZARUS Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn! \nCHRISTY Hopeless I \nMARY LAZARUS Amateurs 2 \nCHRISTY Babies \nMARY LAZARUS Again! \nEXT. CRACK HOUSE - NIGHT \nOne of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as a car suddenly pulls up to the curb.  He starts toward the car as the DRIVER rolls down the window, but before he gets there, Christy and several nuns surround the car. \nPage 75. \nCHRISTY We're here to pray for you, brother. \nDEALER What?  Get the hell out of here. \nCHRISTY We know you don't want to sell drugs. You just had an unhappy childhood, and maybe a learning disability.  You just need someone to pray for you. \nMARY PATRICK We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work. \nCHRISTY And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers. \nDRIVER What is this?  Outta my way! \nThe nuns give him room, and the Driver zips off down the street.  A small crowd has begun to gather, and it is growing by the moment, murmuring encouragement for the nuns.  Christy turns to the Dealer, as other cars drive slowly past. \nCHRISTY Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house. \nMARY ROBERT (to the Dealer) We're nuns! \nMARY PATRICK (to cruising cars) Free prayers right over here!  Drive up and get your prayers! \nDEALER You're hassling my customers!  That's not legal!  I know my rights.  This is restriction of trade. \nCHRISTY You wanna call a cop? \nPage 76. \nThe Dealer's eyes turn ugly as he takes a gun from his pocket.  Mary Patrick steps forward. \nMARY PATRICK Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy? \nMARY LAZARUS Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here. \nCHRISTY (to the crowd) Can I get a witness? \nThe Dealer glances at the surly crowd, then gives the nuns a disgusted look.  He puts the gun away. \nDEALER So I'll find another neighborhood to do my business.  You can' t stop me. \nCHRISTY If we can stop you here, they can stop you there. \nThe Dealer turns and walks back to his house with anger. The crowd APPLAUDS and CHEERS. \nThe picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice of a NEWS REPORTER. \nNEWS REPORTER (V.0.) It was a truly remarkable scene, as the nuns from St. Katherine's literally drove the crack dealers from the neighborhood, led by the feisty Sister Mary Clarence. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK and we see a TV screen with an image of the nuns and neighbors still celebrating.  On top of the TV are several framed photographs of Vince Laflocca, his wife and children. \nINT. VINCE LaROCCA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCONNIE LaROCCA, Vince's wife, watches the TV NEWS STORY and calls to Vince in the kitchen. \nCONNIE Vinnie, get in here.  You gotta see this! \nCarrying a roast beef sandwich and a can of beer, Vince appears from the kitchen and glances at the TV screen to see a shot of the convent.  He looks at Connie and makes a sour face. \nPage 77. \nPage 80. \nChristy hurries toward the chapel, leaving Eddie to shake his head and wonder. \nINT. CHAPEL \nSister Alma plays the organ, and the choir hums quietly as Christy addresses the congregation.  Cameras from several TV stations are focussed on her from various places in the chapel. \nCHRISTY This Sunday's hymn is inspired by the lesson of Mary Magdalene.  You know the one.  Mary Magdalene was a young lady with a past.  She was no stranger to sin. She was no stranger to practically everybody.  Many condemned her.  The whole neighborhood.  But one man refused to do so.  One man said, hey now, wait a minute.  Listen to the story. \nSister Alma starts playing a doo-wop vamp.  Mary Patrick and Mary Robert step forward from the choir, standing beside Christy the way the Ronelles used to do. \nCHRISTY Hey, girls. \nMARY PATRICK AND ROBERT Hail, Mary. \nCHRISTY Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me. \nMARY PATRICK AND ROBERT Oh-huh. \nCHRISTY People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really. \nMARY PATRICK AND ROBERT Really. \nCHRISTY But -- wait. \nMARY PATRICK What is it, Mary? \nCHRISTY That man -- who is he? \nMARY ROBERT He's a carpenter. \nPage 81 \nMARY PATRICK He's not like other guys. \nMARY ROBERT He's decent. \nMARY PATRICK He's kind. \nCHRISTY He's... dreamy.  He's... \nCHOIR Yes, Mary? \nCHRISTY HE'S SO FINE... \nThe full choir sings back-up while Christy, Mary Patrick and Mary Robert perform intricate girl group choreography. \nCHOIR DOO- LANG, DOO-LANG, DOO- LANG. \nCHRISTY/MARY ROBERT/ MARY PATRICK WISH HE WAS MINE THAT HANDSOME GUY OVER THERE THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR \nSister Alma is surrounded by several STREET KIDS who play guitar, bass and drums to accompany the organ and choir. \nLawanda and her friends sit in a pew, moving joyously to the music. \nEddie stands in the back of the chapel, watching a Christy he has never seen before.  Christy is now glowing with happiness and confidence. \nAs the song continues, we see the chapel is packed to the rafters.  A tin bucket is passed around as a collection plate, and it overflows with money. \nEXT. CONVENT \nChurch services are over, and happy people stream out of the convent, but they don't hurry home.  Standing in groups, they talk pleasantly and make plans for the day. There is a real sense of neighborhood up and down the block. \nEddie comes down the steps, glances back at the convent, smiles to himself, then crosses the street to his car. \nPage 82. \nINT. CHAPEL \nChristy and the choir stare at the collection plate that is filled with money. \nCHRISTY Jackpot!  Two buckets \nMARY PATRICK This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing. \nMARY ROBERT I'd rather sing than do anything! \nMARY PATRICK It's better than ice cream. \nMARY ROBERT It's better than springtime. \nCHRISTY It's better than sex! \nEveryone looks at Christy with astonishment. \nCHRISTY (catching herself) I imagine. \nEveryone's attention suddenly turns to Bishop O'Hara as he approaches. \nO'HARA Better and better, Sisters, you are truly an inspiration.  And I bear gladsome tidings. \nThe choir gathers around O'Hara with curiosity. \nO'HARA I've kept the Cardinal informed of your progress in the neighborhood.  He has been most impressed.  And he has invited you to attend a special evening Mass at St. Matthew's Cathedral on Sunday night1 to sing for the Council of Cardinals. \nEddie grabs her hand and pulls her toward the side staircase. \nEDDIE Vince knows you're here. \nCHRISTY (shocked and scared) How? \nEDDIE Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now! \nChristy and Eddie hurry down the steps to the side entrance, and she almost trips on her choral robes.  Eddie opens the door and starts outside, but Christy stops in her tracks. \nCHRISTY I can't go with you. \nEDDIE What? \nCHRISTY I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals. \nEDDIE You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here! \nEddie jerks her hand, and Christy follows him reluctantly to the car. \nINT. EDDIE'S CAR \nEddie takes off at a fast clip up the street.  As the car cruises through an intersection, Christy looks back at the bus with confusion and sadness.  She sees the other nuns rushing back into the convent to look for her. \nINT. REHEARSAL ROOM \nSeveral members of the choir rush into the room with panic in their eyes. \nMARY PATRICK Mary Clarence!  Sister! \nMARY ROBERT It's no use.  She just isn't here. \nPage 93. \nMARY PATRICK It doesn't make any sense.  She was right behind me... \nThe HORN on the school bus blows loudly down in the street. \nMARY ROBERT We can't sing without her!  What should we do? \nMARY PATRICK (calming herself) We'll pray -- and she'll be there. \nThe nuns are calmed by the tone of Mary Patrick's voice. They leave the room to join the others on the bus. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nEddie's police car streaks through crowded streets. \nINT. EDDIE'S CAR \nChristy still looks unsettled. \nCHRISTY Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them. \nEDDIE I think they'd understand. \nCHRISTY That's not the point!  They need me! \nEddie glances at her, impressed by the influence the convent has had. \nEDDIE They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips? \nCHRISTY You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... \"Star Search.\" If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this. \nEDDIE (goading her) Nuns? \nPage 94. \nCHRISTY They're not nuns.  They're like.. people.  With one outfit. \nEXT. CONVENT - DAY \nJoey and Willy park their car in front of the convent, get out quickly and climb the steps to the front door.  They ring the bell. \nJOEY So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun? \nWILLY Yeah, right -- when I see it. \nLawanda and her friends watch Joey and Willy pounding on the convent door. \nLAWANDA You dudes looking for nuns?  They all went to St. Matthew's. \nJOEY St, Matthew's?  Thanks. \nLAWANDA Praise the Lord. \nJoey and Willy run past the girls, get into their car and take off. \nINT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY \nEddie glances at the dashboard and sees that the fuel gauge is close to empty.  He wheels into a gas station and pulls up to the tanks.  Christy starts to open the door, but he stops her. \nEDDIE What're you doing? \nCHRISTY Even nuns have to pee. \nPage 98. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nJoey and Willy wrestle the two nuns to the open door of their car.  They shove Christy and Mary Robert into the back seat, and Willy climbs in next to them. \nWILLY Go! \nJoey starts the car, and it takes off with SQUEALING tires.  Willy has his gun pointed at Christy, who sits beside Mary Robert. \nMARY ROBERT But what do they want?  Where are we going? \nCHRISTY (to Joey and Willy) She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go. \nJOEY Yeah, right to the cops.  No way. \nCHRISTY Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience? \nJOEY What? \nCHRISTY (quickly, to Mary Robert) You can handle this. \nThe car comes to a stop at an intersection.  Christy reaches across Mary Robert and opens the car door.  She shoves Mary Robert into the street. \nCHRISTY Go! \nMary Robert executes a perfect somersault onto the sidewalk.  She looks to heaven, crosses herself and runs back to the cathedral. \nWilly grabs Christy before she can escape. \nJOEY She's gettin' away! \nWILLY Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it! \nJoey takes off again. \nPage 99. \nEXT. STREET \nEddie's car is tied up in traffic, but he turns on his blinker lights and peels over to the opposite lane.  Cars stop to let him through. \nINT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL - DAY \nIn the rehearsal room, Mary Robert has just finished telling the nuns what happened to Christy. \nMARY PATRICK You mean -- they kidnapped her? \nMARY ROBERT Yes -- two men -- and they had guns. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger. \nMARY PATRICK But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun? \nMARY LAZARUS Were they Catholics? \nMother Superior suddenly steps forward. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR She isn't a nun.  Her real name is Christy Van Cartier, and she is a professional entertainer.  She witnessed a vicious crime, and has been hiding in our convent. \nThe nuns all react with shock and emotion. \nMARY ROBERT An... entertainer? \nMARY PATRICK She wasn't a nun? \nANOTHER NUN She lied to us? \nMARY ROBERT But... but... she was such a wonderful nun. \nMARY PATRICK Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully. \nMARY LAZARUS That should have tipped us. \nPage 100. \nMARY ROBERT Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her! \nMARY PATRICK She's our inspiration! \nMARY LAZARUS She's the act! \nMARY ROBERT Reverend Mother, I know that you and Mary Clarence didn't always agree, but -- we've got to help her. \nMARY PATRICK We've got to save her! \nMARY LAZARUS We can't leave it up to the Feds! \nThe nuns all look to Mother Superior for an answer. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were? \nMARY ROBERT She said they were from her old convent. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent. \nVince follows Joey out of the casino with a grim expression. \nINT. STORAGE ROOM \nVince and Joey enter a storage room that is cluttered with boxes.  Christy is tied to a chair in the back of the room, with Willy standing guard over her. \nChristy sits very calmly, despite the anger she is in. She seems distinctly nun-like in her radiant serenity. \nVINCE (turning on the charm) Babe. \nChristy does not reply. \nVINCE Babe, what happened here?  Look at you. \nCHRISTY Good evening, Vincent. \nVINCE What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you? \nCHRISTY I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours. \nVince, Willy and Joey all look at each other, perplexed. \nWILLY She's a nun, Vince. \nVINCE (kneeling by Christy) I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love? \nCHRISTY You will be judged, Vincent.  We all will. \nVince stands; the charm hasn't worked.  He's getting angry. \nVINCE What do you mean -- judged?  I don't get judged, baby. (MORE) \nPage 104. \nVINCE (CONT'D) And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind. \nWILLY She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up. \nJOEY It's spooky.  It's like she ain't even afraid or nothing. \nVince grabs the front of Christy's habit and squeezes it tightly around her throat. \nVINCE She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid. \nCHRISTY (calmly) I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you. \nThis really throws Vince, and angers him further.  He glares at Christy, and then releases her.  He turns to Joey and Willy. \nVINCE Who gives a damn?  Waste her. \nJoey and Willy look a little unsure as Vince storms out of the room. \nINT. PLANE \nThe nuns are mesmerized by the bright skyline with its colorful flashes of neon. \nMARY PATRICK It's so beautiful... \nMARY ROBERT And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas... \nMOTHER SUPERIOR And Gommorah. \nThe plane sets down at the Vegas airport.  Mother Superior and the nuns climb out. \nINT. BAR AREA \nJoey and Willy find Vince near the bar. \nPage 105. \nVINCE It's done? \nJOEY Not... totally. \nVINCE (disturbed) What's the problem? \nWILLY She's... she's a nun. \nVINCE Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe! \nJOEY But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent? \nVINCE It didn't happen. \nWILLY She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car. \nJOEY No smart-ass remarks or nothing. \nVINCE I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time. \nJOEY Yeah... \nWILLY Right.  That way we'd never know which bullet got to her brain and killed her first.  It could always be the other guy. \nThey all look happy with this solution as Joey and Willy leave. \nCHRISTY What? \nJOEY That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off. \nChristy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray. \nWILLY What's she doing? \nJOEY She's praying. \nCHRISTY And God bless Joey and Willy, who are only trying to do their jobs. (faking Latin) Pox fibula tibia vobiscum.  Et marcus domino's pizza.  Have mercy.  Amen. (she looks up at the guys) I'm finished now.  Help me up. \nAs Joey and Willy bend down to help her up, Christy suddenly grabs their neckties in each hand.  With a fierce jerk, she pulls the neckties with all her might, smashing Joey's head against Willy's. \nPage 109. \nStunned, Joey and Willy stagger backward, holding their heads.  Christy scrambles out the door while the two men groan in pain. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nJoey and Willy burst out of the room with guns drawn.  At the far end of the corridor, they spot a glimpse of black clothing as Christy starts down the stairs. \nJOEY There she goes!  she's taking the stairs I \nThey run quickly after her. \nINT. STAIRWAY \nChristy runs down the stairs as a SHOT rings out.  Christy screams and runs even faster. \nINT. CASINO \nA door swings open into the casino, and Christy appears, looking frantic.  A MUFFLED SHOT is heard behind her, and she sprints into the casino. \nSeconds later, Joey and Willy appear. \nJOEY Find Vince and tell him what happened. I'll take this side of the room. \nWilly hurries away to find Vince, and Joey starts searching the crowd. \nEXT. THE MOONLIGHT HOTEL AND CASINO \nThree cabs ROAR up in front of the building and nuns tumble out. \nINT. CASINO ENTRANCE \nThe nuns enter the casino and stop dead in their tracks. Before them is a large room filled with glitter and sin, the SOUND of jackpots and crap tables. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Brace yourselves, Sisters. \nIn unison, the nuns all cross themselves. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Spread out and look for Mary Clarence. Try to blend in. \nThe nuns spread to every part of the room, looking for Christy. \nPage 110. \nINT. CASINO \nA blackjack table; a game is in progress, with several players.  Mary Patrick rushes up to the table. \nMARY PATRICK Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun? \nMARY ROBERT A Benedictine. \nThe CROUPIER and the players stare at the two nuns. \nINT. CASINO \nChristy is making her way past a roulette table. Suddenly, she sees Joey coming toward her, making his way through the crowd.  Christy grabs the arm of a SALESMAN playing roulette. \nCROUPIER Place your bets. \nCHRISTY (to the Salesman) Red 21. \nSALESMAN You sure?  How do you know? \nChristy looks up to heaven. \nSALESMAN (to the Croupier) Red 21. \nJoey stands at the opposite side of the roulette table, glaring at Christy.  The crowd around the table watches Christy for a moment, then they all put their chips down on Red 21. \nJoey starts working his way around the table toward Christy as the Croupier spins the wheel.  The ball falls into a slot. \nCROUPIER Black 14. \nEveryone at the table turns toward Christy, outraged.  She gives them a reprimanding look. \nCHRISTY Did you learn something? \nChristy suddenly realizes that Joey is almost at her side. She shoves the Salesman against him and runs away. \nPage 111. \nJOEY There! \nBefore he can shoot, there is another flash of fabric on the opposite side of the room. \nVINCE (aiming) No -- there! \nAnd a third flash of fabric near the stage. \nJOEY Over there! \nWilly has found the lights, and the lounge is suddenly brightly lit.  The mobsters blink for a moment, then find all the nuns bunched together in a corner, trying to find an exit. \nVINCE Freeze!  Everybody! \nPage 114. \nThe nuns turn and face the mobsters, shielding Christy. \nVINCE Joey? \nJOEY Where is she? \nChristy steps forward, to the front of the stage. \nCHRISTY Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this. \nVINCE Joey -- do it. \nJOEY But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun. \nVINCE She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad! \nMother Superior steps forward. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (with authority) I guarantee you, she is no broad.  She is Sister Mary Clarence, of St. Katherine's Convent.  She is a model of generosity, virtue and love.  You have my word, gentlemen.  She is a nun. \nWILLY Hear that?  Now aren't you glad we didn't shoot her? \nVince has had enough.  Facing Christy, he raises the gun and points it right between Christy's eyes, only inches away.  The nuns all recoil with horror. \nBLAM!  The gun goes off, but Christy isn't hit.  She blinks her eyes open, shocked to be alive.  Instead, it's Vince who falls, crumpling to the floor, and clutching his shoulder. \nAcross the room, Eddie holds a smoking police revolver. The nuns all swarm around Christy joyously. \nMARY ROBERT Mary Clarence -- you're alive! \nMARY PATRICK (smiling) Christy. \nPage 115. \nMARY LAZARUS (also smiling) Van Cartier. \nCHRISTY You know?  About me?  About everything? \nChristy breaks away from the jubilant nuns. She faces Mother Superior. \nCHRISTY Reverend Mother -- Thank-you. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Oh? \nCHRISTY You saved my life. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR I'm a Christian. \nPolice pour into the room and gather up Joey, Willy and Vince.  Eddie walks over to Christy and Mother Superior. \nEDDIE Don't you have a concert to go to? \nCHRISTY That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true. \nMARY ROBERT Not a note. \nMARY PATRICK Impossible. \nMary Lazarus coughs, and points to her throat, as if she has laryngitis.  All the other nuns imitate her. \nCHRISTY (to Mother Superior) Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Very well. (she turns to Eddie) I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger. (sincerely, with a smile) Thank-you. \nPage 116. \nANGLE on Christy, watching this.  She grins. \nCHRISTY Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun? \nEDDIE I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure. \nCHRISTY Yeah, like what? \nEddie takes Christy in his arms, and they begin a kiss. As they do so, Vince struggles toward Christy, as two cops hold him back.  He is furious. \nVINCE I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp! \nCHRISTY (staring at Vince, seeing him for the scum that he is) That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are... \n", "test1_input": "EDDIE You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street. \nCHRISTY All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify! \nEDDIE (to Tate) Get a stenographer. \nPage 18. \nTate leaves.  Christy looks to Eddie for a bargain now. \nCHRISTY Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service. \nEDDIE Maybe Hawaii. \nCLARKSON Diamond Head. \nCHRISTY Yeah.  And I'll need a new look.  Like a disguise. \nEDDIE Maybe Armani. \nCLARKSON No -- Calvin Klein. \nCHRISTY For sportswear.  And a limo.  And my hair -- up? \nCLARKSON It could work. \nEDDIE Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight. \nCHRISTY (confused) Okay -- no limo. \nEDDIE No nothing. \nCHRISTY What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me? \nEDDIE I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you. \nEddie smiles.  Christy doesn't like the sound of this at all a \nPage 19. \nINT. STAINED CLASS WINDOW - DAY \nJesus delivers the Sermon on the Mount in vibrant red, blue and green stained glass.  An ORGAN plays a hymn -- badly.  Notes are missed, skipped over and mutilated. \nPAN DOWN to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel at the ancient St. Katherine's Convent.  The organ isn't getting any better, and we see it is being played by SISTER ALMA, a seventy-year-old nun with arthritis and a hearing aid.  Apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning, because Sister Alma doesn't seem to realize how badly she's playing. \nAs the last nun in the procession enters the chapel, she closes the door behind her.  Across the lobby, the front door opens and Eddie enters with a very reluctant Christy. \nCHRISTY (to Eddie) I hate you.  I totally hate you. \nEDDIE Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here? \nAs Christy looks around the lobby, various religious artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V. ANGLE on a crucifix, casting an ominous shadow, a stack of hymnals, and a large, framed Sunday School-style portrait of St. Katherine.  Christy shudders. \nCHRISTY Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em. \nEDDIE It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along. \nCHRISTY With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince. \nChristy turns to head back to the entrance, but Eddie catches her arm. \nEDDIE Vince has put out a contract on you.  A hundred grand.  You've seen him in action. \nChristy searches his eyes for a lie, but realizes he's telling the truth. \nCHRISTY But... but Vince loves me.  How could he... I mean, five years... \nPage 20. \nEDDIE And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take. \nCHRISTY (suddenly scared) But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me! \nEDDIE Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can. \nCHRISTY (panicking) I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do? \nEDDIE Pray. (smiling) \nFrom inside the chapel, the CHOIR begins to sing a hymn -- horribly.  The voices don't blend, and individual notes are real migraine material.  Christy looks aghast.  Eddie urges her into a corridor, and she follows. \nINT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE \nThe office is bare and austere.  MOTHER SUPERIOR sits at her desk with her hands folded.  Like all the nuns at the convent, she wears the traditional full-length habit and wimple. \nMother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as she rules.  Control is her passion; within the walls of the convent, she has created a world she can trust because it's a world she controls. \nBut Mother Superior is not in control at this particular moment.  BISHOP GEORGE O'HARA stands before her with a majestic presence and some bad news. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no. \nO'HARA We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture. \nPage 21. \n", "test1_true": "O'HARA And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters. \nO'HARA Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR But, Bishop... \nO'HARA St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR I lied. \nO'HARA I know. (smiling) \nMother Superior's jaw locks.  She realizes she is stuck with the situation and will have to control it as best she can.  There is a KNOCK at the door, and Eddie and Christy enter. \nO'HARA Welcome, Lieutenant.  Everything is in order. \nEDDIE Aces.  Bishop -- maybe a cup of coffee, down at the corner? \nThe thought of being left alone with Mother Superior panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's office. \nCHRISTY Hey, you're not leaving me alone... \nO'HARA (reassuringly) You're never alone in this house, my child. \nEddie touches her gently on the arm. \nPage 22. \nEDDIE One month, two tops.  Behave yourself. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Bishop... (a last-ditch attempt) \nO'HARA (opening the door to leave) Lieutenant? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE CONVENT - A FEW SECONDS LATER \nEddie and Bishop 0'Hara are leaving, by the convent's front door.  As they exit, they hear the CHOIR, singing horribly. They both wince at the sound, and then chuckle. \nINT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE \nChristy is pacing, outraged at her new situation. \nCHRISTY A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (very calm) What is your full name?  Your Christian name? \nCHRISTY Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished! \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Your name? \nCHRISTY Christy.  Christy Van Cartier. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Enough joking. \nCHRISTY That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Very well. \nCHRISTY Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's! \nPage 23. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR St. Anne's? \nCHRISTY Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR You were unhappy? \nCHRISTY I was expelled!  When I was fifteen? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR The reason? \nCHRISTY Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR I see. \nCHRISTY You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun! \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (very stern) Sit down. \nCHRISTY What? \nMother Superior rises.  She is an extremely imposing woman. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Sit. \nChristy sits in a wooden chair across from Mother Superior. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Miss Van Cartier. \nCHRISTY What? (belligerent) \n", "test1_id": 1794, "test2_input": "MOTHER SUPERIOR Your cigarette -- out. \nChristy inspects her cigarette. \nPage 24. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (ruefully) It has come to pass. \nCHRISTY What? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs. (staring at Christy's outfit) Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls. \nCHRISTY Are you talking about me? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR And all those like you. \nCHRISTY You mean black people? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines. \nCHRISTY (very suspicious) What's a concubine? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Check your driver's license. \nChristy stands, facing off with Mother Superior. \nCHRISTY Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (suspiciously gracious) Of course.  But it's almost lunch. \nPage 25. \nCHRISTY Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change \nCHRISTY (sniffing her clothes, the same outfit she's had on since the night at Vince's office) Deal. \nINT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM \nA small room, with a sewing machine, some bolts of fabric, and several wooden cabinets.  There is a wooden screen in a corner, marking a changing area.  Christy is behind the screen; we hear her, but do not see her,  Mother Superior stands beside the screen, catching the various items of clothing which Christy tosses to her. \nCHRISTY (O.S.) How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  \"Guest of St. Katherine's\" \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Would you like that? \nMother Superior takes Christy's skirt and blouse, and tosses them down a chute marked \"INCINERATOR.\" \nCHRISTY (O.S.) You should hand-wash that blouse, and send somebody out for some things.  I look good in reds, purples, hot pink -- and shoes.  Five-inch heels.  Fuck-me pumps.  Oh, man -- sorry.   'Scuse my mouth. \nMother Superior carries Christy's lacy bra at the end of a ruler; it goes down the incinerator. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire. \nCHRISTY (O.S.) Can do. \nINT. CHAPEL \nA group of nuns are praying, their heads bowed.  They hear a muffled SCREAM, from elsewhere in the convent. They look up, puzzled. \nPage 26. \nINT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM \nChristy is standing before a full-length mirror, staring at herself, in complete shock.  She now wears a habit and wimple.  Mother Superior is doing final adjustments on the wimple. \nCHRISTY (almost unable to speak) No!  No!  I can't do this! \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way. \nCHRISTY (furious, in disbelief) But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin! \nMOTHER SUPERIOR As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence. \nCHRISTY (outraged) Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy? \nINT. CONVENT HALLWAY - A MINUTE LATER \nMother Superior is striding down the hall.  Christy is beside her, trying to get the hang of her new outfit. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty... \nCHRISTY (pulling out her pockets) No problem. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR The vow of obedience. \nCHRISTY Like to who? \nPage 27. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR And the vow of chastity. \nCHRISTY I'm outta here. \nChristy starts to leave; Mother Superior grabs her by the wimple \n", "test2_true": "A large, whitewashed gothic room, with oak beams and a crude iron chandelier.  There is a long, central wooden table, with rough wooden benches. \nThe convent's population is standing around the table in silence.  There are about thirty nuns in all. \nMother Superior moves to the head of the table, with Christy following her.  She motions for Christy to stand at her right. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Good afternoon, Sisters.  I apologize for my tardiness.  I would like you to welcome a new member of our order, Sister Mary Clarence. \nANGLE on SISTER MARY ROBERT, the nun standing beside Christy.  Sister Mary Robert is naive and mouse- like, but very sweet.  She has only been at the convent a few years; she wears the simpler habit of a novice.  She sneaks a look at Christy.  Her eyes widen, and then she resumes staring at her hands. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Mary Clarence comes to us from a somewhat more progressive convent.  She is eager for a more disciplined life, and will make every effort to conform to our ways. \nEveryone sits, including Christy.  SISTER MARY PATRICK, a nun seated at the middle of the table, waves her hand. Mary Patrick is extremely cheerful, a truly upbeat person. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Yes, Mary Patrick? \nMARY PATRICK Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's. \nANGLE on Christy, looking thoroughly disgusted. \nPage 28. \nMARY PATRICK As part of our welcome, I've had a little thought, just for fun.  Could we have our new friend offer today's blessing? \nANGLE on the nuns, watching Christy. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (reluctantly) Very well.  Mary Clarence, rise please. \nChristy stands up slowly, aghast. \nCHRISTY A blessing?  Like, for lunch? \nANGLE on Mary Patrick, beaming.  She and the other nuns bow their heads. \nCHRISTY (trying to recall a blessing) For what we are about to receive... \nSo far, so good.  Mother Superior has one eye open. \nCHRISTY may the Lord... prepare us and... watch us and... walk through the valley and be our shepherd and... to the republic for which it stands... God bless us every one, hallowed be thy name.  Hallelujah. Ave Maria. Boyardee.  Amen. \nANGLE on the nuns, staring at Christy. Mother Superior rises, very quickly. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence. \nCHRISTY A what? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard. \nCHRISTY Silence?  No talking?  All day? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Until sundown. \nPage 29. \nCHRISTY (mouthing the words. without speaking aloud) Oh my God. \nChristy reaches for a piece of bread. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR And Mary Clarence? \nChristy looks up. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast. \nCHRISTY (mouthing the words) A what? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat. \nCHRISTY (mouthing) No food? \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (taking away Christy's plate) No food.  Not until sundown. \nANGLE on Christy, clutching her fork, hungrily watching the other nuns eat. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nVince leaves the police station with his henchmen, Joey and Willy, and LARRY NARREN, an attorney.  Vince is steaming as they walk through the parking lot. \nVINCE They grilled me for six hours in there. And my hotshot lawyer -- where the hell were you? \nLARRY It takes time, Vince.  Slow and steady. We've been through this before. \nVince reaches his car.  As Joey opens the door for him, another car drives by, and stops.  Eddie is driving; he leans out the window. \nEDDIE So long, Vince.  See you soon. \nPage 30. \nVince lurches toward Eddie; Larry restrains him.  Eddie drives off, chuckling. \nVINCE He's so damn cocky.  This is different. \nJOEY It's a bluff, Vince. \nVINCE You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got. \n", "test2_id": 1795, "test3_input": "MOTHER SUPERIOR A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party. \n(MORE) \nPage 86. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D) You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate. \nCHRISTY Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going. \nMOTHER SUPERIOR I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence. \nCHRISTY But... \nMOTHER SUPERIOR Good day. \nChristy, frustrated, leaves the room.  Mother Superior looks up, she is truly torn, a proud woman unsure of her choices. \nEXT. CONVENT - NIGHT \nThe moon casts shafts of silver light down to the courtyard of the convent.  Most of the lights in the neighborhood are out at this late hour. \nCHRISTY'S VOICE (whispering) Come on... I've got a surprise... \nINT. CONVENT KITCHEN - NIGHT \nThe kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle carried by Christy.  Three more candles appear, carried by Mary Robert, Mary Patrick and Mary Lazarus.  The door to the freezer opens, and light spills out.  Christy removes several pints of ice cream and distributes them to the nuns. \nMARY ROBERT (delighted) Ice cream! \nMARY PATRICK Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this? \nMARY LAZARUS It's a sin.  It's a wicked indulgence. Is this butter almond? \nPage 87. \nChristy and the nuns sit on stools, enjoying their ice cream by candlelight. \nCHRISTY It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift. \nMARY ROBERT A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking. \nMARY LAZARUS Is there any syrup? \nCHRISTY Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up. \nMARY ROBERT Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes. \nMARY PATRICK Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us. \nMARY LAZARUS We could cut a demo.  Look for a label. \nCHRISTY (knowing she has to leave) That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow. \nMARY ROBERT (worried) Are you leaving us? \nCHRISTY (sincerely) Oh no.  We'll always be together. \nMARY LAZARUS That's what Diana Ross said. \nPage 88. \nChristy and the nuns qiggle, and continue eating their ice cream, in a spirit of true friendship. \nMother Superior watches this scene, hidden in the shadows by the door to the kitchen.  She has begun to see Christy in a new light.  She looks thoughtful, and walks off. \nINT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY \nTate sits at his desk in the detective room, reading the sports section.  HENRY PARKER, the accountant for the police department, looks stressful as he enters the room and heads for Eddie's glassed-in office.  Tate glances up as Parker passes his desk. \nTATE You're too late.  Mulcahy just left. \nPARKER I need his signature on some things. They can't be processed without it. \nTATE Leave 'em.  He'll sign 'em later. \nParker looks annoyed -- he doesn't like deviations from procedure -- but after a moment of indecision, he sets the file folder on Tate's desk and walks away. \nTate finishes the newspaper and shoves it aside.  Bored, looks at his watch, then flips the file folder open and glances at its contents;  routine money vouchers for equipment, supplies, etc.  Tate is about to close the folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye. \nTATE What the hell is this...? \nHe examines a money voucher for a generous donation to St. Katherine's Convent in San Francisco.  It only takes a moment to put two and two together, and Tate scrambles for his phone and dials a number. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nHenry Parker waits for the elevator.  When it opens, he's surprised to see Eddie step out. \nPARKER Tate said you were gone. \nEDDIE I get all the way down to my car, and, of course -- where are the keys? \nPage 89. \nPARKER I left the money vouchers with him.  He said you'd sign them in the morning. \n", "test3_true": "INT. VINCE'S OFFICE \nVince is on the telephone.  He signals Joey and Willy, and they move quickly toward him. \nVINCE This is it.  Get ready to move.  No mistakes.  Grab her, get her to the Moonlight.  We meet there, and we take care of her. (into phone) We're on it.  Give me the address. \nVince begins to write down the address. \nINT. SQUAD ROOM \nTate is hunched over the telephone, talking quietly with his back to the rest of the room.  The voucher for St. Katherine's is in his hand as Eddie moves quickly toward him. \nTATE St. Katherine's Convent on East Barton. It's gotta be the place. \nTate hangs up the phone and BOOM!  Eddie hits him from behind like a linebacker, drilling him to the floor.  Other detectives look up from their desks with confusion and alarm.  Eddie pins Tate to the wall and snatches the voucher from his hand. \nEDDIE You're the leak, you son-of-a-bitch! \nClarkson and another detective restrain Eddie before he can hit Tate. \nEDDIE Get him out of here!  Downstairs, in the cell!  I want his ass locked up now! \nNobody dares even question Eddie at this moment, and two detectives drag Tate away.  Eddie grabs Tate's phone and dials long distance. \nEDDIE Clarkson, get on the other line.  Call Frisco Central.  Tell 'em to get two squad cars outside St. Katherine's convent, and stop anybody with an out-of- state license plate from getting near the place. \nClarkson dials quickly.  Eddie listens to Tate's telephone as it RINGS and RINGS and RINGS. \nINT. CONVENT - DAY \nAll the nuns are in the chapel as the choir rehearses a hymn, along with Gina and her girlfriends.  Those who are not in the choir clap their hands in rhythm.  War in the background, we can hear the telephone RINGING. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nEddie's police car streaks past an entrance ramp with the SIREN screaming.  It blazes through traffic, weaving in and out at breakneck speeds.  A moment later, Joey and Willy pull onto the highway at a fast rate.  The race is on, with Eddie securely in the lead. \nINT. CONVENT - DAY \nIn the rehearsal room, the choir members are putting on their robes.  Christy and several nuns are all trying to primp in front of one small mirror. \nMARY ROBERT The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words? \nCHRISTY Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus? \nMARY PATRICK It should be here any minute. \nMARY LAZARUS (with a clipboard) Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp. \nChristy looks out the window, but sees no bus. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nEddie's police car streaks toward L.A. \nPage 91. \nEXT. CONVENT - DAY \nThe neighborhood has turned out to see the choir off. Banners hang from the fire escapes of the building across the street:  \"ST. KATE'S - THE GREATEST!\", \"GOOD LUCK TONIGHT!\" \nA Catholic school bus pulls up to the convent and parks in front.  Several nuns in choir robes come outside and hurry onto the bus.  A moment later, Eddie's police car streaks up to the side entrance of the convent, parking around the corner from the bus. \nINT.

{"test1_input": "OFF Dale's defeated look -- \nCUT TO: \n39 INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER 39 \nStacy lies on the chair with the nitrous mask over her nose. Julia and Dale stand beside her. \nSTACY (LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS) Ten, nine... eight... seh... \nAnd she's out. Immediately, Julia pounces on Dale, feverishly trying to unbuckle his belt. \nDALE Hey! Stop it, what are you -- ? \nJULIA You're gonna give me that dong, Dale! \nDALE NO! \nStacy groans softly. Dale pushes Julia away. \nDALE I knew you only brought her in here to mess with me. \nJULIA Let's have sex on top of her. Let's use her like a bed! \n(CONTINUED) 39 CONTINUED: 39 \nJulia begins to clamber up onto Stacy's supine body. Dale pulls her off. \nDALE All right, that's it, Julia. This is over. You're out of your mind. I quit! \nHe goes to turn off the gas but before he can -- \nJULIA I'll tell her you fucked me! \nDALE What? \nJULIA If you don't fuck me, I'll tell her you fucked me. \nDALE Tell her whatever you want. She'd never believe you. \nJulia opens a nearby drawer and tosses an envelope onto Stacy's chest. \nJULIA She already knows you're a sex offender. And once she sees these, I think she'll believe me. \nDALE What is that? \nJULIA You remember your first week here when I replaced the crown on your second bicuspid? \nDALE (NERVOUSLY) ... Yeah? \nJULIA I took a few snapshots of the procedure. For my files. \nDale lunges at the envelope and pulls out the photos. \n40 CLOSE ON THE PICTURES 40 \n-- Dale lies on the dentist chair, his eyes open and his hands behind his head with Julia at his crotch, apparently fellating him. \n-- Julia, now nude, straddles Dale, who is naked from the waist down on the chair. She holds one arm in the air like a rodeo cowboy. \n-- Julia is on the floor, her legs splayed while Dale lies limply on top of her. \n-- Julia is on all fours. Dale is limply draped over her back, apparently doing her doggy-style. \n41 BACK TO SCENE 41 \nDALE (SHOCKED) You... you did all this while I was unconscious? \nJULIA Yup. \nDALE How did you make it look like I was awake? \nJULIA Taped your eyes open. \nDALE This is rape! You raped me! \nJULIA Don't get all dramatic. Your dick wasn't hard. But it will be next time. Or else Stacy here gets a look at my photo album. \nShe holds up the packet of photos. \nJULIA (SUDDENLY PROFESSIONAL) Now, let's repair this patient's filling, shall we? \nDale gapes at her, dumbstruck. \n42 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - THAT EVENING 42 \n", "test1_true": "DALE Let's kill the bitch. \nKURT Huh? \nNICK What bitch? \nDALE My boss. Our bosses. They need to die. \nNick and Kurt exchange a look. \nNICK We were drunk last night, man. And didn't you say killing was wrong? \nDALE That was before Julia tried to fuck me on top of my fianc\u00e9e's unconscious body. \nKURT Whoa! \nDALE I say we kill them all. Are you guys in or out? \nKURT I was in last night. \nDALE Yes! Nick? \nThey both turn to Nick who is uncertain. Kurt spots the photo of Nick with his GRANDMOTHER and grabs it off the wall. \nKURT Look at her. Look at Bubby. \nNICK Gam Gam. \n(CONTINUED) 42 CONTINUED: 42 \nKURT Look at Gam Gam. Getting a smooch from her favorite grandson. Little does she know that she'll never get to say goodbye to him. And why? Because his shithead boss wouldn't let him leave. What would Gam Gam want you to do? \nNICK Probably not kill him. \nKURT This isn't about Gam Gam. This is about you. What do you want, Nick? \nNICK I want him to die. \nKURT Damn straight! \nNICK Okay, I'm in. \nKURT All right! Let's do this. (THEN) How do we do this? \nDALE I was thinking about that on my way over. Stacy and I watch a lot of `Law & Order' and there's a ton of ways criminals mess up. Things we'd never think of. They leave behind clothing fibers, bullet casings, hair, skin cells -- \nKURT Skin cells?! I can't even keep track of my keys! \nDALE Exactly. And that's why we need a professional. \nNICK What are you talking about, a hitman? \nDale nods. \n(CONTINUED) 42 CONTINUED: (2) 42 \nKURT You know, that's not bad. I mean, we don't clean our own apartments, right? We hire someone to clean them for us. \nDALE Maybe you do, moneybags. \nNICK But where are we supposed to find a hitman? \nDALE That's the only problem. I have no idea. \nThere's a beat. Kurt's eyes light up. \nKURT I do. Meet at my place tomorrow after work. And make sure you're not followed. \nNICK Why would anyone follow us? \nKURT I don't know. People get followed. \nDALE What people? \nKURT Just meet me at my place. \n43 INT. KURT'S APARTMENT - NEXT EVENING 43 \nKurt opens the door on Nick and Dale. The decor of Kurt's place is best described as a middle-income bachelor pad. \nKURT Come in. The guy should be here pretty soon. \nNICK Wait. You actually found someone?! \nKURT It was as easy as buying a used futon. (CONTINUED) 43 CONTINUED: 43 \n", "test1_id": 2919, "test2_input": "73 INT. KURT'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 73 \nKurt and Nick begin pulling on their gloves. \nDALE Can I have a pair? \nNICK You know, last time with the three of us, it got a little... messy. What if Kurt and I go in and you stay here and watch out for Harken? \nDALE Okay -- again, I don't know what he looks like. \nNICK If anyone approaches the house, assume it's him and give us a signal. \nDALE Fine. I'll honk the horn six times. \nKURT Maybe something a little more subtle? \n(CONTINUED) 73 CONTINUED: 73 \nDALE Honk the horn four times? \nNICK How about you just honk once? \nDALE People honk once all the time. You'll be running in and out of the house. \nKURT Fine. Honk twice. \nDALE (SKEPTICAL) Okay... \nNick and Kurt get out of the car. After a beat, Dale remembers his sandwich and pulls it out of his pocket. \n74 EXT. HARKEN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 74 \nKurt and Nick sneak up to the front porch which is camouflaged by shrubs. They peek inside. \nNICK (WHISPERING) Looks like the coast is clear. \nKurt tries the windows. They're locked. \nKURT Damn. Guess we'll have to break in the old-fashioned way. \nKurt looks around and spots a small rock beside the porch. He picks it up and winds back to throw it at the window. \nNICK Kurt, wait! \nBut it's too late. Kurt has released the rock. It HITS the window, but instead of breaking the glass, the rock itself BREAKS into two pieces. \nKURT Holy shit. I broke the rock. \nNICK No, it's one of those hide-a-key things. Look... \n(CONTINUED) 74 CONTINUED: 74 \nNick shows Kurt a key concealed in one half of the fake rock. He grabs it and inserts it into the front door lock. \n75 INT. HARKEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 75 \nThe guys tiptoe in, whispering and tense. The place is tastefully decorated with attractive furniture and modern art. There is a vase of flowers on a table. \nNICK Wow. This is not how I pictured his place. \nKURT For all we know, he's got a closet full of skin suits. \nA CAT springs out of nowhere, startling them, then runs off. \nNICK Jesus! \nKURT Stupid cat. (THEN) Let's check upstairs. \nThey head up. \n76 INT. KURT'S CAR - SAME TIME 76 \nDale is finishing the last of his peanut butter sandwich. He checks the rearview mirror. No sign of anyone. \nDALE (singing a la Cher, SIMULATING AUTO- TUNE) `Do you believe in love after love/I can feel something inside me say/I really don't think you're strong enough now...' \n77 INT. HARKEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 77 \nJust as Kurt and Nick enter, the cat suddenly jumps out from behind the door, startling them again. \n(CONTINUED) 77 CONTINUED: 77 \nKURT God damn it! How many cats do they have? \nNICK I think that was the same one. \n", "test2_true": "Kurt notices a framed wedding photo on the dresser of Harken and Mrs. Harken. \nKURT Damn. That's Mrs. Harken? I'd like to cover her in cock yogurt. \nNICK You want to cover every woman in... did you say `cock yogurt'? \nKURT I did. \nYet again, Kurt and Nick jump as the cat LEAPS out of hiding with a YOWL then runs off. \nKURT Ahhh! \nNICK If he's so scared of us, why doesn't he just leave us alone?! \n78 INT. KURT'S CAR - SAME TIME 78 \nDale plays a bowling game on his cell phone. \nDALE C'mon, c'mon... yes! \nA breeze blows through the open windows of the car, catching the plastic bag from Dale's sandwich and carrying it out the window. \n79 EXT. KURT'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 79 \nJust then, Harken, in running attire, comes jogging up the street. His eye is caught by the plastic bag falling from the car window onto the street. He stops and angrily picks up the bag. \n(CONTINUED) 79 CONTINUED: 79 \nHARKEN Hey, schmuck. \nDale, surprised, turns to the window. \nDALE Excuse me? \nHARKEN You want to tell me why you're littering on my street? \nDALE Oh, I'm sorry, that blew out the window. I wasn't littering. \nHARKEN I don't care if it blew out of your twat. Now, get your fucking Chevy Cavalier the hell off my block! \nDALE Whoa. Sir, there's no need to be hostile. \nHARKEN Hostile? You want to see hostile? How about I go in the house and get my -- \nSuddenly, Harken begins to choke and his face grows increasingly red. \nDALE Get your what? \nWith one hand Harken grabs his throat and with the other he looks at the plastic bag he's holding. \nHARKEN (STRAINED) Peanuts? \nDALE Huh? Oh, yeah. It was a peanut butter sandwich. \nHarken collapses to his knees. His face is turning blue now. Dale quickly steps out of the car. \nDALE Oh god! What should I do?! Tell me what to do! \n(CONTINUED) 79 CONTINUED: (2) 79 \nHarken yanks up the right leg of his jogging pants revealing an EPI-PEN strapped to his ankle. He reaches for it, but Dale moves faster. \nDALE What do I do with this? Should I inject you?! \nHarken nods urgently as his eyes begin to roll back. \nDALE Okay, hold on! I got this. \nDale takes the cap off the epi-pen, raises his arm and jams the needle into Harken's chest. Harken lets out a grunt. \nDALE Did I do it? Did I get enough in?! I'm gonna do it again! \nDale raises his arm again. \n80 INT. HARKEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 80 \nNick continues to search around the bedroom. Kurt is by the window. \nNICK Do you see a Day Runner or an address book? \nKURT NO -- (glances out the WINDOW) What the...? Dude, check this out. \nNick joins him at the window and they both react as they see what appears to be Dale repeatedly STABBING Harken in the chest, neck and arms. Harken lies motionless on the sidewalk. \nNICK (EXCITED) That's Harken! Dale's killing Harken! \n", "test2_id": 2920, "test3_input": "NICK Okay, stay close. (CONTINUED) 122 CONTINUED: 122 \nKURT (NOT LISTENING) Gotcha. \nThe three of them head toward the study. \n123 INT. HARKEN'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 123 \nJust as Nick and Dale enter, Harken looks up and sees them. \nHARKEN What the hell are you doing here? (TO DALE) You come to stab me a few more times, you lunatic? (TO NICK) And my wife invited you? Are you fucking her too? \nNick tries his best to suppress his nervousness and be cool and threatening. \nNICK We know what you did, Harken. \nHARKEN What does that mean? \nNICK We were there. We saw you kill him. \nHARKEN (TURNING DEAD SERIOUS) So what is this? A shakedown? You think you can blackmail me because you saw me kill my wife's lover? \nNick winces. So close. \nDALE (BLURTING OUT) Say his name. \nNick and Harken turn to Dale. \nHARKEN What? \n(CONTINUED) 123 CONTINUED: 123 \nDALE The guy you killed. What was his name? \nHARKEN Trust me, Pellit's name doesn't matter anymore. \nNICK There it is! (turning to Dale) Let's go, guys -- \nHe freezes as he sees for the first time that Kurt didn't accompany them into the study. It's just him and Dale. Nick looks around, panicked. \nHARKEN Yeah, I killed Pellit -- \nNICK Hang on. Hold that thought, because I want to get my friend, KURT -- \nHARKEN I walked right up to his door and I shot him in his fucking chest, and I'll tell you something: I liked it. So if you think I'm a pussy who won't do the same exact thing to some half-assed blackmailer, guess again. \nNICK (looking back at the LIVING ROOM) You know who really thinks you're a pussy is my friend Kurt. Let me go grab him and you can tell him exactly what you just -- \nHARKEN You're pathetic, Waters. You come into my home, on my goddam birthday and try and pull this shit? Well, guess what? You're a dead man. You... (TO DALE) ... you, and your friend Kurt, whoever the fuck he is. Dead. Men. \n(CONTINUED) 123 CONTINUED: (2) 123 \nDALE (SOFTLY) We didn't know it was your birthday. \nHarken has crossed to a drawer and taken out a small safe. He begins turning the combination lock. \nNICK What are you doing? What's in that? \nHARKEN My gun. Just give me a second. \nNick and Dale exchange a look, then quickly rush out of the room. \n124 INT. HARKEN'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 124 \nlooking thoroughly freaked out, Nick and Dale push their way through the partygoers. \nNICK We had him! We had the whole thing. What happened to Kurt? \nJust then, the door to a guest bathroom opens and Kurt emerges, buckling his belt and looking strangely red in the face. \nKURT Oh, hey. \nNICK `Hey'?! Where were you?! \nKURT Uh, I had to go to the bathroom. Bad salmon puff. Are we ready to record Harken? \nNICK You're too late, Kurt! He confessed the whole damn thing! \nDALE More than once! Then he told us we were dead men! He's getting his gun right now! \nKURT Oh, man, I'm so sorry. I fucked up.

KURT'S CAR - MINUTES LATER 126 \nNick sits steaming mad as Kurt drives. Dan fiddles with the tape recorder in the back. \nKURT Look, I wasn't thinking. She's so hot and I'm so weak. I'm a weak, weak man. I admit it. \nFrom the back seat, we hear from the tape recorder: \nKURT (V.O.) In here? But all those people are right outside. \nMRS. HARKEN (V.O.) I know. That makes it even hotter. \nWe hear unbuckling and unzipping. \nMRS. HARKEN (V.O.) Your balls are so smooth. \nKURT (V.O.) I wax them. \nDALE Is there anything you don't wax? \nKurt shrugs. We hear some WET, SMACKING SOUNDS. \n(CONTINUED) 126 CONTINUED: 126 \nNICK Ugh. Turn it off, Dale! \nKURT (V.O.) Oh yeah... oh shit! \nMRS. HARKEN (V.O.) Whoops. That was fast... \nKURT (QUICKLY) Yeah, Dale, turn that off! \n127 EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION 127 \nA short distance behind a car is following Kurt's. As it comes closer we see it's a Porsche. And it's driven by a determined-looking Harken. \n128 EXT. KURT'S APARTMENT - SHORT TIME LATER 128 \nKurt's car turns the corner and stops short. \n129 INT. KURT'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 129 \nFrom the guys' POV we see an unmarked car and a police squad car parked outside of Kurt's place. Hagan and Samson stand with two UNIFORMED OFFICERS. \nKURT (O.S.) Holy shit! They must have found my DNA. \nNICK (O.S.) Turn around! Get us out of here! \n130 EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION 130 \nKurt quickly does a U-turn and ZOOMS off in the direction they came, inadvertently SPEEDING through a red light. We see a traffic camera FLASH. \n131 INSERT - A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH 131 \nclearly showing the three guys, their faces distorted with panic. \n132 INT. KURT'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 132 \nKURT Okay, it's clear that none of us can go home again. Probably ever. \nDALE What?! \nKURT I'm sure they have cops at all our places. I think our best bet is to get out of the country. \nNICK Where are we going to go? \nKURT Mexico? \nDALE Everyone flees to Mexico. That's the first place they'll look. \nKURT You're right. What about Asia? We could become kick boxers. \nNICK What the fuck are you talking about? \nKURT What if our entire lives have been leading up to this moment? What if we were destined from the very beginning to become Asian kick boxers? \nNICK What if I was destined to smack you right in the face? \nKURT That seems like a lesser destiny. \n", "test3_id": 2921}

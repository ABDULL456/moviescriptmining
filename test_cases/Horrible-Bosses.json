{"train": "HORRIBLE BOSSES \nWritten by \nMichael Markowitz \nApril 14, 2010 \nFADE IN: \n1 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 1 \nLooking incredibly weary, NICK WATERS, 30's, enters his apartment in his business suit. He stumbles into -- \n2 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 2 \nHe drops his briefcase, strips off his jacket, loosens his tie and collapses onto the bed like a dead man. PAN OVER TO the alarm clock which reads \"1:23 AM.\" \nMATCH CUT TO: \n3 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 3 \nThe alarm clock now reads \"4:59 AM.\" It switches to \"5:00\" and a BLARING BUZZER goes off. Nick sits up in bed, shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself out of bed. He hurries out of the bedroom, passing the saddest, deadest houseplant in history. \n4 INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 4 \nNick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy leftover containers and crusty condiments. The orange juice container he grabs is empty. \nNICK Damn. \nHe opens the freezer. It contains nothing but multiple boxes of \"Jimmy Dean's Breakfast Bowl -- with Bacon!\" He pops one in the microwave, then glances over at a framed photo of a slightly younger Nick kissing a smiling OLD WOMAN on the cheek. The frame reads: \"I Y Grandma!\" Nick sighs sadly. \n5 INT. NICK'S BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER 5 \nNick sits on the toilet eating his breakfast bowl with a fork. He takes some toilet paper from the roll and wipes his mouth with it. \n6 INT. NICK'S SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER 6 \nNick showers while simultaneously brushing his teeth and shaving. He loses track and brushes his face with the toothbrush. \n7 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 7 \nNick hastily grabs work clothes from his messy drawers and closet. Clearly, no laundry has been done in a while. \n8 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER 8 \nNick hurriedly buttons his shirt, tucks it in and begins tying his tie as the elevator reaches the lobby. \n9 INT. NICK'S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER 9 \nAs he drives to work, he dials a number and transfers it to speakerphone. \nJENNA (V.O.) (GROGGY) Hello? \nNICK (CHEERY) Hey, Jenna, it's Nick. \nJENNA (V.O.) It's five-thirty in the morning, Nick. \nNICK Yeah, sorry. This is like the only time I have to make any personal calls. I just wanted to see if you felt like going out again because I had a great time with you on our last date. \nJENNA (V.O.) Our last date was two weeks ago. You haven't called me since. \nNICK I know and that's my bad. I've been swamped at work -- \nJENNA (V.O.) Yeah, I remember. Work was all you talked about when we went out. \nNICK Right. Well, I'm up for a promotion which will give me a lot more free time -- \n(CONTINUED) 9 CONTINUED: 9 \nJENNA (V.O.) Listen, I'm actually seeing someone. And even if I weren't, the last thing I need is some career-obsessed guy complaining about work all the time. See you around, Nick. \nShe hangs up. \n10 EXT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES - SHORT TIME LATER 10 \nA soulless four-story building in a drab office park. Nick exits his car and runs full-speed to the entrance. \n11 INT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 11 \nNick bursts through the doors and looks at his watch. It reads \"6:02.\" He looks up at a security camera with a flashing red light, indicating he is on tape. \nNICK Fuck! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nHARKEN My pleasure. \nHarken returns to his chair and sits. \nNICK Aren't you having one? \nHARKEN It's 8:15, Nick. I'm not an alcoholic. \nNICK Oh. Well, I only took it because I thought you were having one. \nHARKEN You took a drink because you thought I was going to have one? (MORE) (CONTINUED) 15 CONTINUED: (2) 15 HARKEN (CONT'D) That doesn't exactly sound like something a Senior VP would do. \nNICK Well, I -- \nHARKEN What if you thought I was going to dip my balls in honey and shaved coconut? Would you do that too? \nNICK (LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) Of course not. \nHARKEN Of course not. Anyway, we've moved up the date of the AGM so you're gonna need to complete your due diligence by Monday. You'll probably need to be here all weekend. \nNICK (SIGHS) Okay. \nHARKEN Hey, you want a promotion, you've gotta earn it. Life's a marathon and you can't win a marathon without putting a few Band-Aids on your nipples. \nNICK (huh?) Got it. \nNick gets up to go. \nHARKEN Nick. \nNick turns back. \nHARKEN That's 18-year-old Scotch. I can't really pour it back into the bottle. \nNick, unsure of what to do, picks up the glass and gulps it down. \n(CONTINUED) 15 CONTINUED: (3) 15 \nHARKEN That should carry you till lunch, huh? \n16 EXT. DENTAL OFFICE - DAY 16 \nA car pulls up outside the modest building. \n17 INT. STACY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 17 \nSTACY, cute, 30's, is dropping off DALE STEVENS, 30's, who wears the scrubs of a dental hygienist. \nSTACY Boy, I have to get used to driving with this heavy ring on. I keep swerving to the left. \nDALE Aww. You really like it? \nSTACY I love it. I feel like a queen. \n18 CLOSE ON HER ENGAGEMENT DIAMOND 18 \nIt's tiny and yellowish. \n19 BACK TO SCENE 19 \nDALE Well, you're my queen. I love you, Stacy. \nSTACY Have a great day at work. \nThey kiss. Dale exits the car. \n20 EXT. DENTAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 20 \nStacy drives off. Dale steels himself for what lies ahead, then goes inside. \n21 INT. DENTAL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 21 \nDale enters the waiting room, passing a few PATIENTS. He grabs a mask and goggles from a supply room, then heads INTO -- \n22 INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 22 \nDale finds his boss, DR. JULIA HARRIS, 30's, sexy but with something a little off, hovering over a patient, MR. ANDERTON, 50's. Dale seems visibly uneasy. \nJULIA All right, Mr. Anderton, I'm going to give you the nitrous now and your root canal will be over before you know it. (TO DALE) Dale? Please. \nDale turns the valve on the tank and soon Mr. Anderton's eyes roll back in his head. Julia shuts the door, picks up a drill and begins boring into the patient's molar. \nJULIA (loudly, over the DRILL) How are you today, Dale? \nDALE I'm fine. Thanks. \nKURT GAMBLE, 30s, good-looking, sits at his desk. Unlike Nick and Dale, Kurt seems content in his workplace. A reasonably cute, but by no means drop-dead gorgeous, UPS GIRL approaches his desk with a package. \nUPS GIRL Excuse me? Can you sign for this, please? \nKURT (TAKING IT) Sure. (LOOKING UP) Whoa, whoa. Hold on. What is this? \nUPS GIRL I'm sorry? \nKURT This is one of those hidden camera shows, isn't it? \nUPS GIRL What do you mean? \nKURT Come on. You're way too good- looking to be a UPS girl. What are you, a model? An actress? What's gonna happen when I open this box? Is something going to jump out at me? \n(CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: 24 \nUPS GIRL (GRINNING) Nothing's gonna happen. I'm just a UPS girl. \nKURT Shut up. \nUPS GIRL (PLAYFULLY) You shut up. It's true. \nKURT Well, then, I need to take you out to dinner. \nUPS GIRL Why? \nKURT Because I want to be able to tell my friends that I took out the hottest UPS girl in America. Come on, what do you say? \nShe considers this briefly, then scribbles her number on a Post-it note. \nKURT Awesome. I'm Kurt. \nUPS GIRL Myrna. \nKURT Pretty name. How's Tuesday? Macaroni Grill? \nUPS GIRL Okay. \nKURT See you then, Myrna. \nShe heads off. Kurt opens his DATEBOOK and scribbles \"UPS Girl\" in the Tuesday slot. We see every night of the week is filled with appointments with other women: \"Barnes & Noble girl,\" \"Lauren? Laura?,\" \"Blonde Chick\" and so on. \nJACK (O.S.) Busy week? \nKurt looks up at JACK PELLIT, 70s, the kindly, affectionate owner of the company. (CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: (2) 24 \nKURT Hey, Jack. Yeah, just doing my part for the women of America. \nJACK (CHUCKLING) You're what we used to call a rapscallion. \nKURT That sounds a lot more innocent than `sex addict.' \nJACK Walk with me, Kurt. \nThe two of them head toward the exit. \nJACK I wanted to talk to you about -- \nKURT Last quarter's profits? I ran the numbers. We're down by 11 percent year-to-year. \nJACK It's this damn recession. What about cost-cutting measures? \nKURT Well, I know you don't want to cut STAFF -- \nJACK No way. These people have worked their asses off for me. There's no reason they should suffer. \nKurt looks at his boss with admiration. There's a lot of love between these two. \nKURT There's also the issue of our hazardous waste disposal. We're paying a lot right now and the Bolivians have come back with a very good offer. \nJACK You know why it's good? Because they'll dump our chemicals in rivers, pollute water supplies and hurt people. I've spent my life building this company. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 24 CONTINUED: (3) 24 JACK (CONT'D) Would you want the Pellit name to be associated with something like that? \nKURT No, I wouldn't. \nAs they pass the unisex rest room, they see MARGIE, 30s and clearly pregnant, looking uncomfortable as she waits to get in. \nJACK Everything okay, Margie? \nMARGIE Oh hi, Mr. Pellit. Kurt. I've just been waiting to get in there for a while now... \nJACK Who's in there? \nMARGIE It's... your son. \nJACK (SIGHS) Of course it is. (then, knocking on THE DOOR) Bobby? There's someone waiting. You almost done in there? \nNICK There's gotta be other dental hygienist jobs out there. \nDALE I can't apply for another job, remember? \nKURT Oh, right. Because you'd have to tell them you're a child molester. \n(CONTINUED) 26 CONTINUED: (2) 26 \nNICK He's not a child molester. He just took his dick out in a playground. \nDALE It was nighttime and I was peeing! And it's bullshit that I got put on the registered sex offender list for that! \nKURT It worked out. Julia probably hired you because she's a sexual deviant herself. \nDALE Why would they put a playground next to a bar anyway? That's entrapment. \nA SEMI-CUTE GIRL walks past. \nKURT (WITH JOYLESS RESIGNATION) Well, I should go see if that girl wants to bone. \nKurt groans as he pulls himself out of the booth. \nNICK I thought you were all broken up about your boss dying. \nKURT This is how I grieve, okay? \nKurt heads off after the girl. \nDALE Man. He must be grieving all the time. \n27 INT. COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES CONFERENCE ROOM - NEXT DAY 27 \nNick sits alongside five other CO-WORKERS at a conference table. Harken's chair at the head is empty. Nick pours himself some water from a glass pitcher on the table. \nNICK He did say ten o'clock, right? \n(CONTINUED) 27 CONTINUED: 27 \nCO-WORKER Yeah. Do you know what this is about? \nNICK It just said `staff meeting' on the memo. (WHISPERING) Funny how he gets all over me if I'm a minute late, but he makes us wait fifteen. \nHARKEN (O.S.) You were two minutes late, Nick. \nNick jumps as Harken enters. \nHARKEN And I didn't know I had to punch a clock with you. \nNICK You don't. Of course you don't. I'm sorry -- \nHARKEN I'm going to attribute this to your drinking problem. \nNICK I don't have a -- \nHARKEN (with a smile to the OTHERS) Let's get started. Shall we? \nNick's eyes narrow. Suddenly, he grabs the heavy glass pitcher from the table and SHATTERS IT AGAINST HARKEN'S FACE. Shards of glass fly everywhere as Harken falls from his chair onto the floor. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n28 SAME SCENE (REALITY) 28 \nHarken is fine. Nick is as we left him. \nHARKEN Okay, have we figured out our best sales distribution plan for the new model year handsets? \n(CONTINUED) 28 CONTINUED: 28 \nNick's CO-WORKERS bury their heads in their notes. Nick tensely raises his hand. \nHARKEN Yes? \nNICK I simulated a number of sales cycles, factoring in likely end- users, point-of-sale limitations and specific demographic variables. \nHARKEN And? \nNICK And in my opinion, an open plan selling process in our top 30 markets along with targeted upgrade offers to existing customers promises the greatest yield. \nHarken nods. Is he impressed? \nHARKEN Thank you, Nick. Did everyone see how he did that? Yes, he may be a pathological liar and have a crippling drinking problem, but when the chips are down, Nick has what it takes. \nNick glows. \nHARKEN Which brings us to our next order of business. I've decided who I want as our new Senior VP of Sales. He's sitting right here among you. \nPELLIT Bullshit. Look, I know you and my dad were pals. Frankly, I always thought it was weird and gay and I never understood why my dad thought you were so great. But it doesn't matter now because he's in the ground and I'm your boss. And there's gonna be some changes around here. First of all... (pointing to a BALANCE SHEET) What is this `EnviroTech Waste Management' shit that we're paying so much for? \nKURT Your father made the decision to pay a little more to dispose of our chemical waste responsibly. \nPELLIT Yeah, fuck that. We've got an offer from Bolivia to dump the stuff for a third the cost. \nKURT But that would endanger thousands of local residents. \n(CONTINUED) 31 CONTINUED: 31 \nPELLIT So some jungle tribesmen get cancer. Boo friggin' hoo. \nKURT They're not tribesmen. It's a MODERN -- (THEN) Look, Bobby, your dad told me very clearly he'd die before he'd save money by hurting people. \nPELLIT Well then, we're right on schedule, aren't we? \nKurt's eyes narrow. He reaches into the trash can and grabs one of Jack's discarded ACHIEVEMENT TROPHIES and PLUNGES its pointy end deep into Pellit's chest, impaling him in his chair. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n32 SAME SCENE (REALITY) 32 \nKurt sits across from an unharmed Pellit. \nPELLIT Oh, and we also need to trim the fat around here. \nKURT (snapping out of it) What do you mean? \nPELLIT I want you to fire the fat people. They're slow and lazy and they make me sad to look at. Start with Large Marge. \nANGLE ON Margie at her desk. \nKURT Margie's not fat. She's pregnant. I'm not firing her. \nPELLIT Fine. Then fire Professor Xavier over there. \nANGLE ON a balding, middle-aged man in a wheelchair, HANK, who sits at a desk near Margie's. \n(CONTINUED) 32 CONTINUED: 32 \nKURT Hank? \nPELLIT He creeps me out. Rolling around in that weird little chair of his. \nKURT I'm not firing anyone! It's like you don't care about this company at all. \nPELLIT No shit. You think when I was a kid I dreamed of running a fucking chemical company? No. I dreamed of retiring. Of being fed tropical fruit on a beach by a model while she blows me. And as soon as I squeeze all the profit out of this place, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. So here's the deal. You either fire the fatty or the cripple, or I fire both of them. \n33 INT. PELLIT CHEMICAL CO. - MOMENTS LATER 33 \nKurt sighs as he looks from Margie to Hank and back. At last, he gathers his resolve and crosses to Hank's desk. From a RESPECTFUL DISTANCE we watch as Kurt breaks the news to Hank who reacts with sad resignation. \nKurt turns to see Pellit standing directly beside him. \nPELLIT (loudly, to the room) Everyone, can I have your attention please? I've just learned that Kurt has fired our dear friend Hank here. I want you to know that I am as surprised and angry about this as you are. \nKURT What are you -- ?! \nPELLIT This is entirely an accounting department decision. My hands are tied. (then, to Kurt) You are one heartless bastard, Gamble. (CONTINUED) 33 CONTINUED: 33 \nPellit heads off. Hank glares at Kurt. \nKURT Look, Hank, this was not my -- \nHANK Fuck you, Kurt. \nHank wheels away, leaving Kurt to face the angry looks of his CO-WORKERS. \nCUT TO: \n34 INT. DENTAL OFFICE - DAY 34 \nDale, dressed for work, knocks on Julia's office door. \nJULIA (O.S.) Come in. \n35 INT. JULIA'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 35 \nDale enters. \nDALE You wanted to see -- \nHe looks up to find Julia sitting at her desk in nothing but an unbuttoned white lab coat. \nDALE (AVERTING EYES) Oh, God. \nOFF Dale's defeated look -- \nCUT TO: \n39 INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER 39 \nStacy lies on the chair with the nitrous mask over her nose. Julia and Dale stand beside her. \nSTACY (LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS) Ten, nine... eight... seh... \nAnd she's out. Immediately, Julia pounces on Dale, feverishly trying to unbuckle his belt. \nDALE Hey! Stop it, what are you -- ? \nJULIA You're gonna give me that dong, Dale! \nDALE NO! \nStacy groans softly. Dale pushes Julia away. \nDALE I knew you only brought her in here to mess with me. \nJULIA Let's have sex on top of her. Let's use her like a bed! \n(CONTINUED) 39 CONTINUED: 39 \nJulia begins to clamber up onto Stacy's supine body. Dale pulls her off. \nDALE All right, that's it, Julia. This is over. You're out of your mind. I quit! \nHe goes to turn off the gas but before he can -- \nJULIA I'll tell her you fucked me! \nDALE What? \nJULIA If you don't fuck me, I'll tell her you fucked me. \nDALE Tell her whatever you want. She'd never believe you. \nJulia opens a nearby drawer and tosses an envelope onto Stacy's chest. \nJULIA She already knows you're a sex offender. And once she sees these, I think she'll believe me. \nDALE What is that? \nJULIA You remember your first week here when I replaced the crown on your second bicuspid? \nDALE (NERVOUSLY) ... Yeah? \nJULIA I took a few snapshots of the procedure. For my files. \nDale lunges at the envelope and pulls out the photos. \n40 CLOSE ON THE PICTURES 40 \n-- Dale lies on the dentist chair, his eyes open and his hands behind his head with Julia at his crotch, apparently fellating him. \n-- Julia, now nude, straddles Dale, who is naked from the waist down on the chair. She holds one arm in the air like a rodeo cowboy. \n-- Julia is on the floor, her legs splayed while Dale lies limply on top of her. \n-- Julia is on all fours. Dale is limply draped over her back, apparently doing her doggy-style. \n41 BACK TO SCENE 41 \nDALE (SHOCKED) You... you did all this while I was unconscious? \nJULIA Yup. \nDALE How did you make it look like I was awake? \nJULIA Taped your eyes open. \nDALE This is rape! You raped me! \nJULIA Don't get all dramatic. Your dick wasn't hard. But it will be next time. Or else Stacy here gets a look at my photo album. \nShe holds up the packet of photos. \nJULIA (SUDDENLY PROFESSIONAL) Now, let's repair this patient's filling, shall we? \nDale gapes at her, dumbstruck. \n42 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - THAT EVENING 42 \nKURT Actually, I do find Atmanand a little off-putting. \n(CONTINUED) 48 CONTINUED: 48 \nGREGORY (V.O.) (FLAT) You have arrived at your destination, sir. \nDALE/NICK Thank you, Gregory./Thanks, Gregory. \n49 EXT. DIVE BAR - SHORT TIME LATER 49 \nKurt's car pulls up on a grimy-looking South-Central street and stops in front of a dingy bar. The guys get out and look around warily. \nKURT This must be the place. \nDALE Aren't you worried about your car? \nKURT Nah, Gregory's watching it. \nNICK You really think we're gonna find a hitman in there? \nKURT I think we're gonna have a hard time deciding between all the hitmen in there. Trust me, these are the lowest of the low. \n50 INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 50 \nThe three guys enter the squalid, smoky place. The room is full of surly-looking PATRONS, none of them white. People turn to stare. \nNICK Oh, real nice, Kurt. Way to be racist. \nKURT This isn't a race thing. We need a criminal and this neighborhood is where they live. I'm not saying that's because there are a lot of black people here. That's the fault of our society that discriminates and disenfranchises them. (CONTINUED) 50 CONTINUED: 50 \nDALE You said they were the lowest of the low. \nKURT I was speaking socio-economically. \nNICK So what do we do now? Yell out `anyone here kill people for money?' \nKURT Let me handle this. \nThey each take a seat at the bar where a no-nonsense BARTENDER walks over to them. \nBARTENDER Yeah? \nKURT Hey. How you doing? Nice place. (LEANING IN) Listen, does anyone here kill people for money? \nNICK Kurt! \nAn intense-looking GUY on the next stool notices them. \nBARTENDER The fuck did you just say? \nKURT Don't get me wrong. This isn't about race. Our society discriminates and disenfranchises YOU -- \nDALE (head in hands) Oh my God. \nBARTENDER I'm a small business owner. Who are you calling disenfranchised? \nKURT I didn't mean you in particular. \nBARTENDER Right. You mean all black people. \n(CONTINUED) 50 CONTINUED: (2) 50 \nNICK Maybe we should go? \nBARTENDER You could do that. Or I could take the aluminum baseball bat I'm holding in my right hand and disenfranchise your teeth from your mouth. \nDALE I vote we go. \nThe three stand and head for the door. \nKURT Okay, we're going. I'm sorry if I offended you. It was never my -- \nBARTENDER Oh shit, please shut up. \nKURT Okey doke. \n51 EXT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 51 \nThe guys come out onto the sidewalk. \nDALE This is ridiculous. We're never gonna find someone to do this for us. \nCOCKSUCKER JONES (O.S.) Yo! \nThey turn to see COCKSUCKER JONES, 30s, the guy who was sitting next to them at the bar. \nDALE Or plastic. I read an article that plastic is actually better for the environment than paper. \nCOCKSUCKER JONES Fuck the environment! Just put that shit in a briefcase. \nNICK Got it. Thanks. Come on, guys. \nThey turn to go, when Dale turns back. (CONTINUED) 52 CONTINUED: (4) 52 \nDALE Should we deduct the cost of the briefcase? \nCOCKSUCKER JONES What?! \nDALE I mean, assuming we don't get the case back... We're not getting the case back, right? \nCocksucker glares at him. \nDALE Well, that's like an extra eighty bucks. Only seems fair that we should take that out of your end. \nNICK We'll cover the briefcase, Dale. \nDALE Then let's get a cheap one. It doesn't have to be real leather. (then to Cocksucker) Are you cool with faux -- ? \nKurt grabs Dale by the shoulder and hustles him to the car. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n53 SERIES OF SHOTS 53 \nMUSIC CUE: Frank Sinatra's \"(Forget Your Troubles, Come On) Get Happy\" \n-- Dale, Kurt and Nick each take a turn at an ATM machine, withdrawing the maximum amount they can. \n-- Nick at his desk at work. He looks over his cubicle wall and his eyes narrow as he sees Harken directing a WORKMAN who stencils the words \"Senior Vice President of Sales\" below where it already says \"President.\" Another WORKMAN uses a sledgehammer on the wall of the office. Nick grins malevolently. \n-- Kurt is at his desk in the chemical company. He looks up to see Bobby Pellit open his office door and lead out two obvious HOOKERS. Pellit has white powder around his nostrils. He spots Kurt watching him and he sneers back. Kurt smiles devilishly. \n(CONTINUED) 53 CONTINUED: 53 \n-- CLOSE ON Dale as he places tooth X-rays into plastic contact sheets. PULL BACK to reveal Julia is licking his neck while tweaking his nipples through his scrubs. In contrast to earlier, Dale appears to be unfazed and almost amused by Julia's antics. \n54 EXT. ALLEY - THAT NIGHT 54 \nCocksucker Jones holds an open briefcase that's empty but for a single stack of taped together 20-dollar bills. \nCOCKSUCKER JONES Looks like it's all here. \nDALE Turns out we didn't really need the briefcase after all. Could've just used a manila envelope. \nKURT Shut up, Dale. \nNICK So, Cocksucker, how long do you think it'll be before you've... taken care of business? \nCOCKSUCKER JONES Here's the thing. I just got out of doing a dime for some pretty ugly shit and I'm still on probation. They're watching me. So if I step out of line, I go right back inside. \nKURT You told us you could take care of it. \nCOCKSUCKER JONES And I'm gonna. I'm gonna be your professional advisor. Think of me as your murder consultant. \nNICK We don't want a murder consultant. We want a murderer. \nDALE I knew we were getting ripped off! \nKURT Okay, look. This isn't what we talked about. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 54 CONTINUED: 54 KURT (CONT'D) Can we just get our money back, please? Then we'll be on our way. \nCOCKSUCKER JONES Sorry, no refunds. \nNICK That's five thousand dollars. You think we're just gonna walk away and let you keep that? \nCOCKSUCKER JONES (getting in his face) I think you're forgetting who you're talking to. \nCocksucker pulls back the lower edge of his jacket to reveal what appears to be the holster of a gun. \nDALE Whoa, whoa! We don't want any trouble. \nCOCKSUCKER JONES Now either I give you the advice you paid for, or you can walk away with nothing. Up to you. \nKURT Look, the whole reason we came to you is because we don't have the experience to do it ourselves. \nCOCKSUCKER JONES Most killers are first-timers. Look, the key to a good murder is making it look like an accident. Gas leak, brakes failing, suicide, that sort of thing. If you do it right, you won't even have to be there when it goes down. \nNICK That makes sense. But how would we fake three accidents? \nCOCKSUCKER JONES You need to stalk your prey, track their movements, get to know them inside and out. Where do they go? What do they eat for breakfast? Who're they fucking? \n(CONTINUED) 54 CONTINUED: (2) 54 \nNICK Are we even sure he's home? \nThey exchange looks. \nKURT (opening his door) Let's go check it out. \nThey get out of the car. Dale pockets his sandwich. \n60 EXT. PELLIT'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 60 \nThe three guys creep around Pellit's patio, peeking in doors and windows. Finally: \nNICK I don't see him. \nKurt is about to try a window when Dale stops him. \nDALE What are you doing? \nKURT We're not gonna get intel standing on his lawn. We have to go in. \nDALE What about fingerprints? We don't have gloves. \nKURT Here, do this. \nKurt pulls his shirt sleeves down over his hands. Dale does the same. Nick, who wears a T-shirt, tucks his hands inside the bottom of the shirt. With some difficulty, Kurt slides open the window. \nKURT Here we go. \nThe three of them manage to wriggle through the window. It's not graceful: Dale's foot gets caught on the sill, causing him to tumble on top of Nick and Kurt. At last, all three are inside. \n61 INT. PELLIT'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 61 \nKURT Dale, keep an eye out. Let us know if Pellit's coming. \nDALE Got it. Wait, I don't know what he looks like. \nNICK It doesn't matter. Just tell us if anyone comes. \nDALE Got it. \nThey take in Pellit's living room. There's a leather sofa, a 60-inch plasma and enormous speakers. On the wall are framed Ed Hardy posters depicting dragons and half-naked girls. \nKURT Wow. This guy's a bigger douchebag than me. \nNICK Okay, let's split up. Look for any intel we can use on him. \nKURT What kind of intel? \nNICK I don't know. I guess we'll know it when we see it. \nKurt heads upstairs while Dale and Nick look around the living room. \nDALE Hey, Nick? Does this count as intel? \nNick looks over to see Dale holding in his sleeve-covered hands an open wooden box filled with white powder. \nNICK Holy shit, that's a lot of blow. \nDALE God, this must be worth, like, ten thousand -- oh shit! \n(CONTINUED) 61 CONTINUED: 61 \nSuddenly, the box slips out of Dale's hands. It hits the floor, sending a cascade of cocaine all over the rug. \nNICK What the fuck?!! \nDALE Sorry, my sleeves were slippery! \nNICK We've got to get that back in the box. \nDALE I've got it. \nHe kneels and begins trying to scoop up the coke in his hands. It's an impossible task. \n62 INT. PELLIT'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 62 \nKurt looks around the room. He doesn't see anything useful so he heads into -- \n63 INT. PELLIT'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 63 \nHe flips on the light. His eyes land on Pellit's toothbrush. He grins slyly. \n64 INT. PELLIT'S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 64 \nDale is still on his knees, scooping up coke, as Nick returns from the kitchen cradling a Dustbuster in his T- shirt. \n73 INT. KURT'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 73 \nKurt and Nick begin pulling on their gloves. \nDALE Can I have a pair? \nNICK You know, last time with the three of us, it got a little... messy. What if Kurt and I go in and you stay here and watch out for Harken? \nDALE Okay -- again, I don't know what he looks like. \nNICK If anyone approaches the house, assume it's him and give us a signal. \nDALE Fine. I'll honk the horn six times. \nKURT Maybe something a little more subtle? \n(CONTINUED) 73 CONTINUED: 73 \nDALE Honk the horn four times? \nNICK How about you just honk once? \nDALE People honk once all the time. You'll be running in and out of the house. \nKURT Fine. Honk twice. \nDALE (SKEPTICAL) Okay... \nNick and Kurt get out of the car. After a beat, Dale remembers his sandwich and pulls it out of his pocket. \n74 EXT. HARKEN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 74 \nKurt and Nick sneak up to the front porch which is camouflaged by shrubs. They peek inside. \nNICK (WHISPERING) Looks like the coast is clear. \nKurt tries the windows. They're locked. \nKURT Damn. Guess we'll have to break in the old-fashioned way. \nKurt looks around and spots a small rock beside the porch. He picks it up and winds back to throw it at the window. \nNICK Kurt, wait! \nBut it's too late. Kurt has released the rock. It HITS the window, but instead of breaking the glass, the rock itself BREAKS into two pieces. \nKURT Holy shit. I broke the rock. \nNICK No, it's one of those hide-a-key things. Look... \n(CONTINUED) 74 CONTINUED: 74 \nNick shows Kurt a key concealed in one half of the fake rock. He grabs it and inserts it into the front door lock. \n75 INT. HARKEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 75 \nThe guys tiptoe in, whispering and tense. The place is tastefully decorated with attractive furniture and modern art. There is a vase of flowers on a table. \nNICK Wow. This is not how I pictured his place. \nKURT For all we know, he's got a closet full of skin suits. \nA CAT springs out of nowhere, startling them, then runs off. \nNICK Jesus! \nKURT Stupid cat. (THEN) Let's check upstairs. \nThey head up. \n76 INT. KURT'S CAR - SAME TIME 76 \nDale is finishing the last of his peanut butter sandwich. He checks the rearview mirror. No sign of anyone. \nDALE (singing a la Cher, SIMULATING AUTO- TUNE) `Do you believe in love after love/I can feel something inside me say/I really don't think you're strong enough now...' \n77 INT. HARKEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 77 \nJust as Kurt and Nick enter, the cat suddenly jumps out from behind the door, startling them again. \n(CONTINUED) 77 CONTINUED: 77 \nKURT God damn it! How many cats do they have? \nNICK I think that was the same one. \nKURT Holy shit! He's really doing it! (REALIZING) Out where everyone can see him. \n(CONTINUED) 80 CONTINUED: 80 \nNICK What the hell is he thinking?! \nKURT He's not stopping. He's gonna get us all caught. We've gotta get out of here. \nNICK What about Dale? \nKURT He's a psychopath. We leave him behind. \nNICK Right. Let's go through the back! \nAs they hurry to leave the room, Kurt stumbles over the CAT which has appeared yet again. Unseen by either of them, PELLIT'S BLACKBERRY SLIPS out of his pocket and lands on the floor at the foot of Harken's bed. \n81 EXT. HARKEN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 81 \nAs Dale kneels over Harken to check his breathing, a car pulls up alongside and MRS. HARKEN steps out. Seeing her husband on the ground, she rushes over. \nMRS. HARKEN Oh my god! What happened?! \nDALE He had an allergic reaction. But I think he's coming around. Do you know him? \nMRS. HARKEN He's my husband. \nMrs. Harken kneels beside Harken and supports his head. \nMRS. HARKEN Honey? Can you hear me? \nHarken groggily looks down at his torso which is perforated by dozens of tiny needle marks. \nHARKEN (groggy, to Dale) Wha-- What did you do to me? \nDALE I injected you with your thing. (CONTINUED) 81 CONTINUED: 81 \nMRS. HARKEN He saved your life, honey. (TO DALE) Thank you so much! \nShe grabs Dale in a warm hug. \nDALE Oh, it was nothing. \nHARKEN (to Mrs. Harken) What's this? What's with the hugging? \nMRS. HARKEN I'm just thankful that he was here. \nHARKEN I'll bet you are. Do you know this guy? \nMRS. HARKEN No. We just -- \nHARKEN Are you fucking him, Rhonda? \nMRS. HARKEN Oh, come on. \nHARKEN (TO DALE) What were you doing out here, anyway? Waiting to fuck my wife? \nDALE (FLUSTERED) I've never met your wife -- \nStill a bit woozy, Harken gets to his feet and points at Dale. \nHARKEN You need to get the hell out of here. \nMRS. HARKEN Dave, stop it. You should be thanking him. Why are you being so suspicious? \n(CONTINUED) 81 CONTINUED: (2) 81 \nHARKEN Why? Because I know you sleep around on me. And I'm going to find out who it is. \nMRS. HARKEN You're being ridiculous. \nHARKEN Am I? What about Maurilio? I see the way you look at him. \nMRS. HARKEN I am not having sex with the gardener! \nAs Harken and his wife continue to bicker, Dale quietly retreats to Kurt's car. \n82 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - LATER 82 \nNick and Kurt pace nervously. \nNICK I can't believe that idiot Dale. You realize we're all going to jail because of him. \nKURT I can't go to jail. Look at these eyes. Look at this ass. They'll be all over me. \nNICK Yeah, me too. \nNICK (ON PHONE) Hey. Have you learned anything about Julia yet? \nKURT Well, I've learned that Dale is a homosexual because this chick is unbelievably hot. How's it going over there? \nNICK I'm just waiting for Pellit to go to sleep. I wonder how Dale's doing with Harken. \n86 EXT. HARKEN'S STREET - SAME TIME 86 \nDale's car is parked. \n87 INT. DALE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 87 \nDale watches the movie Precious on his laptop. He glances over to see Harken turn on the light in his bedroom. On the seat beside Dale, we see a large jar of Planters peanuts. \n88 INT. HARKEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 88 \nHarken looks around suspiciously, then goes to Mrs. Harken's closet. He opens it and begins looking through her clothing. He sniffs one of her dresses and his eyes narrow. He sniffs himself, then compares it to the smell of the dress. Unsatisfied, he continues searching around the room for any incriminating evidence. Suddenly, his foot comes in contact with something on the floor. He reaches down and picks up... \nPELLIT'S BLACKBERRY. \nHe turns it on and scrolls down the contacts list to \"HOME\" which shows Bobby Pellit's name and address. Harken's face turns beet red. \n89 INT. DALE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 89 \nDale ducks down as he sees Harken's garage door opening. Harken's Porsche 911 pulls out and zooms up the street. Still scooched down, Dale dials his phone. \n90 INT. NICK'S CAR - SAME TIME 90 \nNick watches Pellit performing a series of sweaty KUNG FU MOVES in a full-length mirror. \nNICK Jesus, where does he get the energy? (REMEMBERING) Oh yeah. \nCELL PHONE RINGS. \nNick answers. \nNICK What's up, Dale? (CONTINUED) 90 CONTINUED: 90 \nDALE Harken just left his house. I'm going in. \nNICK Good luck, man. \nDALE Thanks. \n91 INT. HARKEN'S BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER 91 \nDale flips on the light and enters clutching the peanut jar in his gloved hands. He slides open the shower curtain and Harken's CAT LEAPS OUT at him. \nDALE Ahhh! \nHe regains his composure and finds a bottle of men's shampoo. As he nervously removes the cap from the shampoo and the lid from the peanuts, he notices that MR. PEANUT is STARING right at him. Despite his jaunty top hat and little monocle, there is something almost accusing in his look. Dale stares back at Mr. Peanut as we see his resolve soften. \n92 INT. NICK'S CAR - SAME TIME 92 \nNick watches as Pellit finally gets into bed and turns off his bedside lamp. \nNICK Okay. Here we go. \nNick reaches for the door handle as -- \nSFX: Nick's cell phone rings. Nick jumps, then answers the phone. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n93 INT. HARKEN'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 93 \nDALE (INTO PHONE) Nick? \nNICK What? \n(CONTINUED) 93 CONTINUED: 93 \nDALE I'm not sure if I can do this. \nNICK Where are you? \nDALE In Harken's bathroom. About to pour the nuts in his shampoo. But, I just... I know he's a real shithead, but he's still a person, y'know? \nLights appear in Nick's rearview mirror. \nNICK (looking down at the rat poison, RELUCTANTLY) Yeah. I know. \nHarken's Porsche pulls up and stops just behind Nick's car. Harken gets out and heads toward Pellit's front door. \nDALE What should I do? Should I do it? \nNICK You think when it came down to it, you would've been able to murder Julia? \nKurt softens. \nKURT I don't know. I mean, afterwards, it was kind of hard to imagine killing her. \nNick and Dale turn to him, quizzically. \nDALE `Afterwards'? \nKurt realizes what he said. \nNICK You slept with her, didn't you? \nDALE (TO KURT) Oh god. Please tell me you didn't sleep with her. \nKurt lowers his head. \nNICK You are a mess. \nKURT I know, I know. But it's not my fault. \nCUT TO: \n100 FLASHBACK - EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 100 \nKurt's car is parked across the street. \nKURT (V.O.) At first I was surveilling her just like I was supposed to... \n101 INT. KURT'S CAR - NIGHT 101 \nKurt watches through her bedroom window as Julia undresses sexily. \nKURT (V.O.) Then she started deliberately undressing in front of the window. With the lights on. She must've known I was there. \nAs Julia removes her bra, we see Kurt's face pressed against his car window, his breath fogging it up. \n102 INT. KURT'S CAR - LATER 102 \nJulia enters her bedroom with a tray of food. She wears a skimpy kimono-style robe. She sits on her bed and unwraps a Popsicle. \nKURT (V.O.) Then she made herself a little snack. A Popsicle... \nWe see Julia eat the Popsicle as suggestively as humanly possible. Then she picks up a banana and peels it. \nKURT (V.O.) ... then a banana.... \nJulia eases the whole banana into her mouth. Then she picks up a hot dog. \nKURT (V.O.) ... and finally a hot dog. I mean, three penis-shaped foods cannot be coincidence. And in that weird order? That's not a proper meal. \n103 EXT. JULIA'S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER 103 \nDALE (V.O.) So you took that as an invitation to fuck her? \nJulia opens her front door, stares straight at Kurt and beckons him inside with one finger. She walks back inside, leaving the door wide open. \nKURT (V.O.) No. I took her invitation to fuck her as an invitation to fuck her. (CONTINUED) 103 CONTINUED: 103 \nKurt opens his car door so quickly he tumbles out headfirst, planting his face on the street. He jumps up, but one ankle is tangled in the seatbelt. He finally extricates himself and hurries to the house as fast as he can. \n104 INT. BRADFORD'S BAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT) 104 \nNICK There is something clinically wrong with you. \nKURT I know. I'm a rapscallion. \nDALE You're not a rapscallion. You're a whore. A filthy whore. \nKURT Hey. Not nice. And besides, I think I actually solved your problem, Dale. Julia just needed a good fucking. I bet she's not going to mess with you anymore. \nNICK Whatever. We have bigger fish to fry right now. What do we do about Harken? \nKURT Here's what we do. We call the cops and make an anonymous tip that Harken killed Pellit. Boom. Harken's in jail. Pellit's in hell. Julia's had the crazy fucked out of her. Our problems are solved. Boom. \nNICK Okay, but we should find a payphone. We don't want them tracing the call to us. \n105 EXT. BRADFORD'S BAR - MINUTES LATER 105 \nNick, Kurt and Dale emerge from the bar. \nNICK Come on, we'll take my car. \nThe three of them climb into Nick's car. \nDALE (WRY) You want me to get you a Kleenex? \nKURT I can't believe this. (TO NICK) What were you doing near his house?! \nNick looks at him, pissed. \nNICK Where were you during the murder? \nKURT I was making love. \nDALE (SNORTS) `Making love.' \nKURT (to the cops) Let me ask you something, Detective. Let's say one of us knew who the shooter was and was willing to hand you that perp on a platter. Would he be entitled to some sort of immunity for that information? \nBoth Dale and Nick shoot daggers at him. \nHAGAN No. But he would be entitled to some sort of jail time. Because if he knew who the shooter was and didn't tell us, that would be obstruction of justice. \nA beat. \nKURT Well, then I'm glad we have no idea who the shooter is, right, guys? \n(CONTINUED) 110 CONTINUED: (2) 110 \nSAMSON (LOSING PATIENCE) If you expect us to believe this is all just a big coincidence, we're going to be here for a long time. \nDALE Okay wait! \nNow it's Kurt and Nick who look nervous. Is Dale about to crack? \nDALE Saying that we'll be here for a long time implies that we can't leave. Does that mean we're under arrest? \nSamson looks to Hagan who grimaces. \nHAGAN No. We just brought you in for questioning. \nDALE So, you don't have evidence constituting probable cause to arrest us? \nSAMSON Not yet. \nDALE Well then, we're free to go? \nHAGAN Technically. \nDale nervously stands up, half expecting to be hit. \nDALE Come on, guys. \nKurt and Nick, impressed and relieved, stand and head out. \n111 INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION 111 \nThe three guys head for the exit. \n(CONTINUED) 111 CONTINUED: 111 \nNICK (TO DALE) Nice work. Where'd that come from? \nDALE `Law & Order.' \nKURT We really showed those guys. \nNICK `We'? You were gonna turn us in! \nKURT For, like, a second. \nSAMSON (O.S.) Stop! \nThe guys turn to see Samson holding out a traffic citation. \nSAMSON (handing it to Nick) For speeding and running a red light. (THEN) Don't get too comfortable out there, boys. Our forensics team is sweeping Pellit's house for fingerprints and DNA. And they don't miss much. \nWe HOLD ON Kurt's face and -- \nCUT TO: \n112 FLASHBACK - INT. PELLIT'S BATHROOM - DAY 112 \nKurt pulls Pellit's toothbrush out of his butt and returns it to its holder. \n113 BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT) 113 \nKurt suddenly looks nauseous. \n114 INT. KURT'S CAR - MINUTES LATER 114 \nKURT Hold on. You're telling me we've been taking murder advice from someone whose biggest crime was taping an Ethan Hawke movie?! \nCOCKSUCKER JONES So you do know it. \nDALE If you're not a murderer, why do you carry that gun on your belt? \nCOCKSUCKER JONES Gun? \nHe pulls back his jacket to reveal the holster we saw earlier. \nCOCKSUCKER JONES This is a motherfucking iPhone. \nHe pulls the phone out and shows them. \nNICK I feel like such a moron. \nCOCKSUCKER JONES Well, you are a moron. You don't walk into a bar and hand a guy five thousand dollars just because he's black. \nKURT Come on, guys. Let's get out of here. \nThe three of them turn to go. \nCOCKSUCKER JONES (calling after them) Trust me on the wire thing, though. Worked for Donnie Brasco. Bootlegged that movie too. \n116 EXT. POLICE CRIME LAB - NEXT DAY 116 \nHagan and Samson pull up in their car and get out. \n117 INT. FORENSICS LAB - MOMENTS LATER 117 \nThe detectives enter to find a CRIME TECH leaning over his computer. (CONTINUED) 117 CONTINUED: 117 \nHAGAN You got something for us? \nCRIME TECH We didn't find any foreign prints in the house, but we did get a DNA match for one of your suspects, Kurt Gamble. \nSAMSON Where was it? \nCRIME TECH Pellit's upstairs bathroom. His toothbrush. It had traces of Gamble's fecal matter. \nHAGAN That sick bastard. \nCRIME TECH That's not all. We found feces on Pellit's hairbrush, face soap, floss and razor. \nSAMSON Razor?! \nCRIME TECH The handle. Not the blade. This Gamble guy put just about everything in that bathroom up his ass. \nHAGAN All I care about is that it puts him inside the house. That's enough for a warrant for him and his drag racing, sex offender friends. (takes out cell) I'll call the DA. \n118 EXT. HARKEN'S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT 118 \nKurt's car pulls up with the lights off and parks. \n119 INT. KURT'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 119 \nKurt is at the wheel, Nick sits shotgun, Dale in back. \n(CONTINUED) 119 CONTINUED: 119 \nKURT Okay, looks quiet. Is the tape recorder ready? \nDale pulls out a mini-tape recorder and hands it to Nick along with a roll of surgical tape. \nDALE Fresh batteries, fresh six-hour tape, voice activated. \nNICK One of us needs to tape it to our chest. \nKURT I'll do it. I'm the only one without hair on my chest. \nNICK That's `cause you shave it. \nKURT I don't shave it. I wax it. \nNick gives Kurt the recorder and Kurt tapes it to his chest then lowers his shirt. \nDALE So what do we do now? Wait for Harken to come home and ambush him? \nNICK I have a better idea. Let's be in the house when he walks in. He'll be so mad, he'll be more likely to confess. \nKURT Right. We'll sit there in the dark till he comes in, and then switch on a lamp. That'll freak him out. \nDALE Hey, we should find an office chair so one of us can dramatically spin around and face Harken. \nNICK I'll be in the chair. \nSFX: Dale's cell phone rings. \nDALE (ANSWERING PHONE) Hello? \nINTERCUT WITH: \n133 INT. JULIA'S BATHROOM - SAME TIME 133 \nJulia lies in a bubble bath, a glass of wine on the edge of the tub. \nJULIA Hello, lover. \nDALE Oh God. Look, Julia, I can't talk right now -- \nKurt reacts at hearing it's Julia. He makes an \"I'm not here\" gesture. \nJULIA No worries, baby. I actually meant to call your home phone. You know, to tell Stacy about us. \nDALE No! Wait! \nJULIA I think I've waited long enough. I'm tired of you playing with my emotions. \nDALE I'm not playing. I'm going to do it. I swear! \nJULIA This Friday. At the office. \nDALE Fine! \nJULIA Wait. What are you going to do to me? \nDALE I'm going to... have sex with you. \nJULIA Details! And be explicit. \nDALE Right now? You want me to say it? \nKURT Oh, shit. We've got company. \n(CONTINUED) 133 CONTINUED: 133 \nHe points out the back window and the guys react as they see Harken driving directly on their tail. \nNICK It's Harken! Lose him! \nKURT Lose him? Sure, Nick. His 500 horsepower is no match for my 150. \nJULIA (ON PHONE) Say it! \nDALE (BLURTING OUT) I'm gonna put my penis in your pussy! \nDespite the danger, Kurt and Nick turn curiously to look at Dale. \nJULIA Oh, come on, Casanova. You can do better than that. \nDALE (WITH DIFFICULTY) I'm gonna make you feel good. With my tongue... and my fingers. And whatnot. \nJust then, Harken speeds up and SLAMS into the tail of Kurt's car. Kurt struggles to stay on the road. \nNICK Jesus Christ, this guy's nuts! \nJULIA You going to slap me with your cock, Dale? \nDALE Yes! Yes! I'm going to beat your face with my cock! \nJULIA More! \nBANG! Harken again HITS Kurt's car from behind. A tail light shatters. \n(CONTINUED) 133 CONTINUED: (2) 133 \nDALE (FRANTIC) I'm gonna put my balls in your hair! I'm gonna spit on your arms! \nKurt and Nick exchange a baffled look. \nJULIA See you Friday, you dirty bird. \nJulia hangs up. Dale looks like he's been violated. \nDALE Nice job `fucking the crazy out of her,' Kurt! \nKURT Maybe I should've spit on her arms. \nON STAR REP (V.O.) Good evening, Mr. Gamble. \nThe three of them JUMP, startled by the sudden voice in the car with them. \nHARKEN Is it? Because I don't see a shred of evidence proving that I killed Pellit. It's like I've always told you, Nick. Life is a marathon and you can't win a marathon without putting a few Band-Aids on your nipples. \nNick deflates. The three guys realize Harken's won. Then, from the car's open window they hear: \nON STAR REP (V.O.) Did I mention that this conversation is being recorded? \nKurt, Nick and Dale exchange a look of shock and relief. \nHARKEN Who said that? \nKURT (GRINNING) That's Gregory, our On Star rep. \nON STAR REP (V.O.) (PROUDLY) My name is Atmanand! \nHarken's face falls. He looks around nervously as the police cars come to a halt. \nHARKEN You can't -- this isn't -- \nAnd with that, Harken BOLTS AWAY as fast as his injured leg will take him. It's not very fast. The guys watch him for a beat as they share a joyful, exhausted moment together. \n(CONTINUED) 134 CONTINUED: (3) 134 \nNICK I think this is gonna work out okay for us. \nKURT I told you. \nDALE (RE: HARKEN) Should we stop him? \nKURT Probably. \nNICK I've got this. (looking to heaven) This is for you, Gam Gam. \nNick sprints off after his hobbling boss and in SLOW MOTION, violently TACKLES Harken to the pavement. Harken goes down hard, his face SLAMMING against the asphalt. \nAs the COPS hurry toward them, Nick kneels on the back of Harken's neck, pinning him. \nHARKEN Get the fuck off me! \nKurt steps up and kneels beside the battered figure. \nKURT (GENTLY) Hey, Harken, one last thing? \nHARKEN (BARKING) What?! \nKURT Your wife gives great head. \nHarken struggles wildly but he's helpless. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \n135 EXT. PELLIT CHEMICAL CO. - MORNING 135 \nSUPERIMPOSE: ONE WEEK LATER \n(CONTINUED) 135 CONTINUED: 135 \nThe sun is shining. Birds are chirping. It's a bright, new day as Kurt heads into the building. \n136 INT. PELLIT CHEMICAL CO. - DAY 136 \nKurt enters and looks over at what was Pellit's office. He smiles when he sees Margie, the pregnant employee, now running the company. He heads over. \n137 INT. MARGIE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 137 \nKurt knocks on the doorframe and enters. \nMARGIE Oh, hey, Kurt. Come in. \nKURT Thanks, Margie. I just wanted to congratulate you on taking over Bobby's job. \nMARGIE Thank you. Terrible what happened to him. \nKURT Yeah. Tough month for the Pellit family. Anyway, if there's anything I can do to help out before the baby gets here, please let me know. \nMARGIE (CONFUSED) What baby? \nKURT Your baby. \nMARGIE (beat, offended) I'm not pregnant. \nKURT (CHUCKLING) Yeah, right. Look at that big belly. \nKurt pats her belly. Margie now looks genuinely pissed off. \n", "test1_input": "DALE Easy, Kenny. \nKENNY It's just not fair. I was making high six-figures. Now I can't even afford this drink. (holds up glass) Seriously, you think you guys can help me out at all? \nThe three guys exchange uncomfortable looks as they reach for their wallets. \nDALE Uh, sure. Here's a few bucks, Kenny. \nKENNY Okay, y'know that's not really gonna do it for me. (looking around, LEANING IN) I'll tell you what? What if I give you guys handjobs? Forty bucks. We can do it in the bathroom right here. I'll do the three of you for a hundred. \nKURT You're gay now? \nKENNY No, I'm not gay. \nThey look skeptical. \nKENNY I'm the opposite of gay! \nThey guys look at each other with eyebrows raised. Nick mouths \"opposite.\" \nKENNY Come on. Handjobs for the Three Musketeers. Let's do this! \nThe BARTENDER spots Kenny and points at him. \nBARTENDER (YELLING) I thought I told you to stay out of here! \n(CONTINUED) 36 CONTINUED: (3) 36 \nKENNY Whoops. Gotta go, guys. Call me if you change your minds. I'm at my mom's. \nHe hurries out. There's a silent beat as the guys process what they've just witnessed. \nCUT TO: \n37 EXT. STREET - LATER 37 \nThe three guys are walking home, all mildly buzzed. \nKURT So I guess we're just gonna be miserable for the rest of our lives. \nDALE What do you mean? \nKURT What options do we have? We can quit our jobs and turn into Kenny. Or keep our jobs and turn into sad, ball-less losers who spend their days dreaming of ways to kill their bosses. \nThere's a beat as Nick regards Kurt. \nNICK You do that too? \nKURT Of course. Everyone does. It's the only thing that keeps us from going totally bat-shit. \nNICK The other day I imagined shoving one of those jugs from the water cooler in Harken's mouth and making him drink until his bladder explodes. \nDALE Jeez. \nKURT That's so funny. I had the same idea for Pellit. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 37 CONTINUED: 37 KURT (CONT'D) Only using gasoline instead of water. And his ass instead of his mouth. \nDALE You guys are sick. \nKURT What's sick about it? It's just a way to let off steam. \nNICK Yeah, Dale. It's not like we're actually going to kill our bosses. \nThey continue walking. After a beat. \nKURT You have to admit though, our lives would be a lot better if our bosses were dead. \nNICK Well, of course. It's the one thing that keeps me from being happy. \nDALE Me too. \nThere's another beat. \nKURT Let's just consider this, for one second. \nDALE Consider what? \nKURT Killing our bosses. I'm just being hypothetical here. \nDALE (laughing it off) Yeah, right. \nNICK Very funny. \nKURT Well, it's not like they're gonna live forever. These pieces of shit are going to die someday. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 37 CONTINUED: (2) 37 KURT (CONT'D) We'd just be accelerating that natural process. \nNICK Shut up, Kurt. \n", "test1_true": "KURT (EARNEST) Frankly, I don't see any reason not to do it. \nDALE Well, first of all, killing someone is illegal and immoral -- \nKURT It may be illegal but I'm not sure it's immoral. Sometimes one evil person has to die for the greater good of the community. If Bobby Pellit has his way, hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent Bolivians will suffer. It would actually be immoral not to kill him. \nNick begins to warm to the idea. \nNICK I didn't get to say goodbye to Gam Gam because of Harken. \nKURT Exactly! Who knows how many other Gam Gams have died alone. \nDALE I can't believe you guys are actually talking about this. I don't care how bad our bosses are. We're not murderers. \nNICK No, we're not, Dale. We're just trying to live our lives. But what are we supposed to do when someone makes it impossible for us to live our lives? Do we just bend over and take it up the ass forever? \n(CONTINUED) 37 CONTINUED: (3) 37 \nKURT No, we do not! \nDALE What you guys are talking about is wrong and you know it. \nNICK Julia's ruining your life. That's wrong. \nKURT Yeah! \nDALE She's not ruining my life. If anything's ruining my life it's you guys and your drunk bullshit. \nKURT If it's bullshit, Dale, then how come we all want to do it so much? \nThey reach the corner where they part ways. \nDALE I don't want to do it. And when you sober up neither will you. We're not killing anyone. \nDale heads off. \nKURT (TO NICK) I was just being hypothetical. \nNICK (QUICKLY) Yeah, me too. \nOFF their ambivalent looks -- \n38 INT. DENTAL OFFICE - NEXT DAY 38 \nDale is organizing some equipment when a pair of woman's hands suddenly cover his eyes. \nWOMAN (O.S.) (SUGGESTIVELY) Guess who? \n(CONTINUED) 38 CONTINUED: 38 \nDALE (WEARILY) I'm really not in the mood for this now -- \nHe turns and reacts as he sees it's not Julia, but his fianc\u00e9e, Stacy. \nDALE Stacy?! \nSTACY Not in the mood for what? \nDALE For... nothing. What are you doing here? \nJulia appears in her office doorway. \nJULIA I invited her. \nSTACY She called and said now that we're engaged, she wanted to offer me free dental work. And you know I've had that loose filling for a while. It's so sweet of you, Julia. \nJULIA It's my pleasure. You're part of the family now. \nDALE (VISIBLY UPTIGHT) Uhhhh... I don't know if this is a good idea. \nSTACY Why not? \nDALE We don't want to take advantage of Julia. \nJULIA Dale, there's nothing you could do that would be taking advantage of me. Nothing. (then, to Stacy) Now what do you say we pump you full of gas? \n(CONTINUED) 38 CONTINUED: (2) 38 \nJulia leads Stacy into the exam room. Dale cuts them off. \nDALE Wait -- no gas. She doesn't need to be out. \nSTACY What are you talking about, Dale? You know I'm not good with drills. \nJULIA (POINTEDLY) You don't want your fianc\u00e9e to suffer, do you? \n", "test1_id": 2919, "test2_input": "He points to his computer. On the screen is a listing FROM -- \nDALE Craigslist?! You found a hitman on Craigslist. \nKURT Yup. But they don't post it as `hitman.' That would be stupid. They use code words, like `liquidation,' `pest control,' `wet work.' Check it out. This is our guy. \nNick reads the listing. \nNICK `Skilled professional with years of experience in domestic and international wet work. Fast and discreet. No children or political figures.' \nKURT See? He's principled. \nDALE This is so dangerous. What if he's a narc? \nNICK Yeah, Kurt. Call him back and cancel. \nKURT It's too late. He's on his way. \nDALE What do we do if this guy gets here and he asks for so much money that we can't afford him and he gets mad and kills all of us? \nKURT I don't think he'd stay in business long if he killed everyone who couldn't afford him. \nNICK (looking out window) Guys! I think this is him! \nThe others hurry to look. From -- \n44 THEIR POV 44 \nWe see a black Mercedes SLK pull up. A distinguished- looking MAN in a well-tailored suit steps out. He wears sunglasses and carries a briefcase. \n45 BACK TO SCENE 45 \nNICK Nice car. \nKURT Whoa. This guy's legit. \nDALE I bet that briefcase has one of those guns you have to screw together. \nNICK All right, let's just be professional here. We don't want to seem all giddy. \nA knock at the door. \nKURT (HUSHED) How's my hair? \nNICK (SOTTO) It doesn't matter! \nKurt opens the door on the Man who looks even smoother up close. \nMAN (BRITISH ACCENT) Is one of you Kurt? \nDALE (whispering to Nick) Oh my God, he's like James Bond! \nKURT (to the Man) Yes, hi, I'm Kurt. Please come in. \nMAN Thank you. Are all three of you participating in this? \n(CONTINUED) 45 CONTINUED: 45 \nNICK Yes, we are. \nMAN Very well. Now before we go any further, I need to know if there are any hidden recording devices in this room. I will find out if there are. \nDALE No, no! We definitely don't want to record this, sir. \nMAN Then let's get started. \nHe walks to the middle of the living room, opens his briefcase and takes out a plastic tarp which he proceeds to unfurl over the carpet. \nKURT Whoa, whoa. What's that for? \nMAN For the mess. \nNICK We don't want you to kill us! \nDALE (FREAKING OUT) Oh my God! I knew it! \nMAN Kill you? What are you talking about? \nThe guys exchange a confused look. \nKURT Your ad said you do wet work. \nMAN That's correct. I urinate on other men for money. \nNICK/KURT What?! \n", "test2_true": "(CONTINUED) 45 CONTINUED: (2) 45 \nNICK (TO KURT) You were looking in `men seeking men'?! \nKURT Yeah! We're men seeking a man, aren't we? \nNICK You are such a moron. \nMAN So you're telling me I drove all the way to the Valley and no one wants to be pissed on? \nDALE Please don't kill us. \nMAN I don't kill people! (then, sighing) Can I use your rest room? I've stored up rather a large amount of pee for this. \nKURT (POINTING) It's right through there. \nThe Man heads off. After a beat -- \nKURT Good thing I didn't call the guy who was offering to do `dirty work.' \n46 INT. KURT'S CAR - THAT NIGHT 46 \nKurt drives. Nick is in the passenger seat. Dale in back. \nKURT All right, I'll take the blame for that one. \nNICK That's big of you. \nKURT I'm going to make it up to you. I figured out a much better way to find a contract killer. (CONTINUED) 46 CONTINUED: 46 \nDALE What's that? \nKurt reaches up and pushes a button on the rear-view mirror. A male voice comes over the speaker. \nON STAR REP (V.O.) (INDIAN ACCENT) Hello, Mr. Gamble, thank you for contacting On Star -- \nDALE Oh, come on! \nNICK (TO KURT) This is your plan? \nON STAR REP (V.O.) -- my name is Gregory. How can I be of service this evening? \nKURT Gregory, I need you to direct me to the most dangerous bar in Los Angeles. \nON STAR REP (V.O.) I'm sorry? \nKURT We need to find the bar with the most scumbags, lowlifes and hardcore shitheads. Can you help us out? \nON STAR REP (V.O.) I'm afraid our listings are not organized by danger, sir. I do see there is a Bennigan's three blocks from your current LOCATION -- \nKURT Okay, Gregory? That's unhelpful. While I'm sure there are plenty of shitheads there, they're not the kind of shitheads we need. \nON STAR REP (V.O.) I can direct you to the neighborhood with the greatest number of car-jackings in your area. \n(CONTINUED) 46 CONTINUED: (2) 46 \nKURT Now we're talking. \nON STAR REP (V.O.) Very good, sir. You may wish to lock your doors. \nKurt and the others lock their doors. \n47 EXT. SCARY NEIGHBORHOOD - SHORT TIME LATER 47 \nKurt's car drives down a depressed-looking block. \n48 INT. KURT'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 48 \nThe guys are still chatting with Gregory. \nNICK So, do you like living in Bangalore? \nGREGORY (ON STAR REP)(V.O.) It's not bad. Humid. \nDALE Now, `Gregory.' Is that your real name? \nGREGORY (V.O.) No, sir. My real name is Atmanand. \nKURT Atmanand? How did you get Gregory from that? \nGREGORY (V.O.) `Gregory' was assigned to me by On Star. \nNICK Why don't they let you use your real name? \nGREGORY (V.O.) Many Americans find our real names off-putting. \n", "test2_id": 2920, "test3_input": "NICK Okay, stay close. (CONTINUED) 122 CONTINUED: 122 \nKURT (NOT LISTENING) Gotcha. \nThe three of them head toward the study. \n123 INT. HARKEN'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 123 \nJust as Nick and Dale enter, Harken looks up and sees them. \nHARKEN What the hell are you doing here? (TO DALE) You come to stab me a few more times, you lunatic? (TO NICK) And my wife invited you? Are you fucking her too? \nNick tries his best to suppress his nervousness and be cool and threatening. \nNICK We know what you did, Harken. \nHARKEN What does that mean? \nNICK We were there. We saw you kill him. \nHARKEN (TURNING DEAD SERIOUS) So what is this? A shakedown? You think you can blackmail me because you saw me kill my wife's lover? \nNick winces. So close. \nDALE (BLURTING OUT) Say his name. \nNick and Harken turn to Dale. \nHARKEN What? \n(CONTINUED) 123 CONTINUED: 123 \nDALE The guy you killed. What was his name? \nHARKEN Trust me, Pellit's name doesn't matter anymore. \nNICK There it is! (turning to Dale) Let's go, guys -- \nHe freezes as he sees for the first time that Kurt didn't accompany them into the study. It's just him and Dale. Nick looks around, panicked. \nHARKEN Yeah, I killed Pellit -- \nNICK Hang on. Hold that thought, because I want to get my friend, KURT -- \nHARKEN I walked right up to his door and I shot him in his fucking chest, and I'll tell you something: I liked it. So if you think I'm a pussy who won't do the same exact thing to some half-assed blackmailer, guess again. \nNICK (looking back at the LIVING ROOM) You know who really thinks you're a pussy is my friend Kurt. Let me go grab him and you can tell him exactly what you just -- \nHARKEN You're pathetic, Waters. You come into my home, on my goddam birthday and try and pull this shit? Well, guess what? You're a dead man. You... (TO DALE) ... you, and your friend Kurt, whoever the fuck he is. Dead. Men. \n(CONTINUED) 123 CONTINUED: (2) 123 \nDALE (SOFTLY) We didn't know it was your birthday. \nHarken has crossed to a drawer and taken out a small safe. He begins turning the combination lock. \nNICK What are you doing? What's in that? \nHARKEN My gun. Just give me a second. \nNick and Dale exchange a look, then quickly rush out of the room. \n124 INT. HARKEN'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 124 \nlooking thoroughly freaked out, Nick and Dale push their way through the partygoers. \nNICK We had him! We had the whole thing. What happened to Kurt? \nJust then, the door to a guest bathroom opens and Kurt emerges, buckling his belt and looking strangely red in the face. \nKURT Oh, hey. \nNICK `Hey'?! Where were you?! \nKURT Uh, I had to go to the bathroom. Bad salmon puff. Are we ready to record Harken? \nNICK You're too late, Kurt! He confessed the whole damn thing! \nDALE More than once! Then he told us we were dead men! He's getting his gun right now! \nKURT Oh, man, I'm so sorry. I fucked up. (CONTINUED) 124 CONTINUED: 124 \nNICK Yeah, you -- \nSuddenly, the bathroom door opens again and out steps Mrs. Harken, also looking disheveled. She adjusts her dress then rejoins the party. \n", "test3_true": "Overcome with rage, Nick PUNCHES Kurt in the arm then rushes to the door.

KURT'S CAR - MINUTES LATER 126 \nNick sits steaming mad as Kurt drives. Dan fiddles with the tape recorder in the back. \nKURT Look, I wasn't thinking. She's so hot and I'm so weak. I'm a weak, weak man. I admit it. \nFrom the back seat, we hear from the tape recorder: \nKURT (V.O.) In here? But all those people are right outside. \nMRS. HARKEN (V.O.) I know. That makes it even hotter. \nWe hear unbuckling and unzipping. \nMRS. HARKEN (V.O.) Your balls are so smooth. \nKURT (V.O.) I wax them. \nDALE Is there anything you don't wax? \nKurt shrugs. We hear some WET, SMACKING SOUNDS. \n(CONTINUED) 126 CONTINUED: 126 \nNICK Ugh. Turn it off, Dale! \nKURT (V.O.) Oh yeah... oh shit! \nMRS. HARKEN (V.O.) Whoops. That was fast... \nKURT (QUICKLY) Yeah, Dale, turn that off! \n127 EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION 127 \nA short distance behind a car is following Kurt's. As it comes closer we see it's a Porsche. And it's driven by a determined-looking Harken. \n128 EXT. KURT'S APARTMENT - SHORT TIME LATER 128 \nKurt's car turns the corner and stops short. \n129 INT. KURT'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 129 \nFrom the guys' POV we see an unmarked car and a police squad car parked outside of Kurt's place. Hagan and Samson stand with two UNIFORMED OFFICERS. \nKURT (O.S.) Holy shit! They must have found my DNA. \nNICK (O.S.) Turn around! Get us out of here! \n130 EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION 130 \nKurt quickly does a U-turn and ZOOMS off in the direction they came, inadvertently SPEEDING through a red light. We see a traffic camera FLASH. \n131 INSERT - A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH 131 \nclearly showing the three guys, their faces distorted with panic. \n132 INT. KURT'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 132 \nKURT Okay, it's clear that none of us can go home again. Probably ever. \nDALE What?! \nKURT I'm sure they have cops at all our places. I think our best bet is to get out of the country. \nNICK Where are we going to go? \nKURT Mexico? \nDALE Everyone flees to Mexico. That's the first place they'll look. \nKURT You're right. What about Asia? We could become kick boxers. \nNICK What the fuck are you talking about? \nKURT What if our entire lives have been leading up to this moment? What if we were destined from the very beginning to become Asian kick boxers? \nNICK What if I was destined to smack you right in the face? \nKURT That seems like a lesser destiny. \n", "test3_id": 2921}

Another Neo-Nazi, RICK, swats Evan's journals out of his hands and onto the floor. Life springs back into Evan as he rushes for the journals. He and Rick grab the journals at the same time. A minor tug of war. 
EVAN Let go! They're mine! 
Rick tears them away, Evan coming up with only a few torn pages. Evan sees the damage and goes mental. 
EVAN Motherfucker! 
Evan swings at Rick and misses. INMATES CHEER! It's on! Rick lunges for Evan, a brief and painful scuffle ensues, the journals getting trampled. Suddenly -- The sounds of COCKED RIFLES echo through the air. The fight stops instantly as Rick and Evan look up to see -- 
ANGLE ON 
OFFICER STATION. Officers aim rifles at the pair. From an upper tier, even more officers with more rifles. 
Their barrels sight directly at Evan. Rick steps away, quick to maliciously scoop up Evan's torn journals. 
KARL We'll be comin' for you tonight, sister. 
Evan catches his breath, then looks at the remaining few pages on the floor. 
INT. EVAN'S CELL - DAY 
Evan enters the cell with a few entry pages. He looks through them. Nothing there. 
Evan nods depressed, then sees the page from his "Age 7" journal, grabs Carlos' duct tape and tapes the page over his bed. 
INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY 
Evan, walking toward some White Supremacists, flinches whenever the occasional INMATE brushes against him. Evan is completely paranoid, waiting for an inevitable attack. Karl makes himself visible among them, holding a journal. He reads: 
KARL (from Evan's journal) Today I found my grandfather's death certificate. He died in a nut house, just like my father. Mom denies it, but she thinks I'm gonna end up the same way... 
The other Supremacists start laughing and calling "looney" and "nut job." Evan rushes past them and they make chicken clucks at him. 
EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY 
Evan and Carlos sit on BLEACHERS that overlook the other prisoners working out. 
Evan closely watches Karl and Rick who stare daggers at him from across the yard. A SKINHEAD PASSES SOMETHING with a white-taped handle to Karl but no officers seem to notice. 
Evan slides closer to Carlos and stares at the Jesus Christ tattoos all over Carlos' back. 
EVAN You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?" 
CARLOS Straight up. 
EVAN Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me. 
CARLOS Shit. I knew you were crazy. 
EVAN I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams. 
Carlos scoffs whatever. 
EVAN Pack of smokes says I can prove it to you. 
Carlos is suddenly interested. 
INT. EVAN'S CELL - LATER 
Evan holds a tattered journal entry in his hand and finishes up a conversation. 
Carlos looks dumbfounded. 
EVAN So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely. 
CARLOS You need to see the prison shrink, man. 
Their conversation stops when a convict rolls a mail cart by, Evan looking up expectantly. 
EVAN Anything today? 
CONVICT Yep. Just not for you. 
Disappointed, Evan turns back to Carlos. Holds up his journal entry. 
EVAN Just tell me if anything weird happens. 
CARLOS Weirder than this? 
EVAN Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess. 
Evan studies the page. 
JOURNAL ENTRY 
"On Wednesday I got in trouble for a drawing that I didn't do. Mommy wont let me see it."

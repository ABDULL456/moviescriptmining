COLL That song takes me back to the battle of Tylweth Gate. A small horde versus an army. Pickaxes against swords and spears. 
DUIR Them were the days. 
(BEAT) What happened to your quailing cough? Coll shakes his head, "dunno". The two of them smile then join in the singing. A drunken GORT takes a swig of ale and staggers over to GUS. 
GORT Play louder, you whey-face, I can still hear those harpy fairies. He takes another swig and sings at the top of his voice, out of tune, trying to drown out the humming of the unseen fairies. Snow White and the huntsman look on, smiling. 
ERIC Legend has it dwarves were created to uncover all the riches hidden on earth. Not just gold and precious stones, but the beauty in people's hearts. 
SNOW WHITE Really? 
ERIC Ask me, they've lost the art if they ever had it. When the Queen seized their mines she stole their treasure but more than that she stole their pride. And as if to prove it, GORT and NION sing and share from a flask of rum before they tumble to the ground-near Muir as the song ends. Eric notices the tumble and chuckles. 
GORT What are you pribbling at, longshanks?! 
ERIC Nothing half-wit. 
GORT I'm half of nothing.you canker blossom.

130 CONTINUED: 130 
MUIR Son?... Sing the one. Perched on his stone, QUERT nods; sings a more CHEERFUL SONG. Eric watches as Snow White walks over to Muir. Before she can say anything...

130 CONTINUED: (2) 130 
MUIR That seat's not taken, if that's what you were about to ask. She sits on the log beside him. Gort and Nion eye her. 
SNOW WHITE Thank you so much, sir. 
MUIR It's only a log, no need to praise me. 
SNOW WHITE No. For before. For defending me. 
MUIR Your father was a good man. The kingdom prospered. Our people prospered. 
SNOW WHITE There were more of you? 
MUIR Aye. And that is all Muir will say on the subject. Gort fills in. 
GORT One day the group you see before you went down into the mine for a month long shift. Gus was only a boy. When we came back to the surface... nothing. The land was black, everything, everyone... dead, gone. We searched but... Gort surprises himself by choking up a bit. Muir helps out. 
MUIR That was the month your father died. 
SNOW WHITE I'm so sorry. 
MUIR As am I, princess. As am I. GUS walks over to Snow White. 
GUS I know I'm a bit spongy to look at, Miss, but would you care to dance-with a little 'un? 
SNOW WHITE I'd be honored. Snow White gets up and dances with Gus as the song picks up. 
(CONTINUED) 
130 CONTINUED: (3) 130 Nion and Gort watch her dance with Gus. Nion's not impressed, leans in to Gort... 
NION I don't trust her. And I don't believe in her, no matter what Muir says. Gort is still melancholy... 
GORT Just you and me,... do you think there are any of us left? Do you think perhaps they were merely banished? 
NION As long as the Queen's in charge we'll never know. 
GORT Well, maybe that's the point, isn't it? (beat; out of the blue) I feel funny. Queer almost.

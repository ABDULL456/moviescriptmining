THE CITY HALL PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATEER \nBucky exits and sees Lee leaning against an unmarked car talking with a striking woman in an auburn pageboy cut. \nLee waves Bucky over. \nLEE Bucky I'd like you to meet Kay Lake. \nBUCKY Hello. \nFAY I saw you fight a couple times. You won. \nBUCKY I always won. You a fight fan? \nKAY Lee used to drag me. I was taking somme art classes so I'd sketch the boxers. \nLee puts his arm around her. \nLEE Made me quit fighting the smokers. Didn't want me doin' the \"vegetable shuffle.\" \nHe staggers around like a punch-drunk fighter. \nBUCKY I'll try not to hurt you. \nA flicker of anger in her eyes. \nLEE Sure make Loew happy. \nBUCKY He's got money on me, I gather? \nLEE Seems that way. \nBUCKY And if I win I get Warrants? \nLEE Seems that way. \nBucky shakes his head. Turns to Kay. \nBUCKY What do you think of all this, Miss Lake? \nKAY For moral reasons I hope the LAPD gets ridiculed for perpetrating this farce. For financial reasons I hope Lee wins. And for aesthetic reasons I hope you both look good with your shirts off. \nBucky and Lee break into laughter. Bucky sticks out his hand. Lee takes it. \nBUCKY Luck short of winning. \nLEE You, too. \nBucky tips his hat to Kay and turns to go. \nKAY Luck, Dwight. \nHe stops at hearing his real name. But he knows she's waiting to see his reaction so he keeps walking... \nBUCKY'S BOXING MONTAGE \n--Bucky hits the heavy bag in the police gym while Lee spars in the background \nVOICE OVER The 77th Street lieutenant tapped as official LAPD bookmaker had Lee as an early 3 to 1 favorite... \n--Bucky runs through Elysian Park with two pound weights on his ankles. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) ...while the real bookie line had Mr. Fire favored by knockout at 2 1/2 to 1, and decision by 5 to 3. \n--Bucky spars with a fighter, peppering him with jab after jab. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) Even the dicks in Ad Vice had suspended bookie shakedowns because Mickey Cohen was raking ten grand a day and kickin' back five percent to the advertising agency promoting the bond issue. \n--Cops exchange betting markers during roll call... \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) I was a local celebrity again. \nEXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - LINCOLN HEIGHTS - DAY \nBucky pulls up in front of a small ugly house in a tired neighborhood. He exits the car carrying a cardboard box full of canned goods and old girlie magazines. \nON THE PORCH OF THE HOUSE \na bony old man sits in a broken chair, aiming a BB pistol at some balsa wood airplanes scattered in the yard. \nON BUCKY'S FACE \ndisgust and sadness. \nThis is DOLPH BLEICHERT, Bucky's father. Bucky approaches, pulling a chair up next to his father. Up close it's even worse: white skin stretched tight over blue veins, yellow rimming his rheumy eyes. Flecks of dirt and vomit on a filthy shirt. \nBUCKY Papa? \nDOLPH Guten tag, Dwight. \nBUCKY Speak English, papa. \nDOLPH Englisch Schiesser! Amerikan Schiesser! \nHe aims the BB gun and fires at an airplane: the gun's empty. \nBucky enters the house. Half-eaten cans of beans on the dining room table, an entire legion of broken balsa wood airplane kits. Alley cats wander in and out of the kitchen, nosing their faces into open tuna fish cans... \nBACK ON THE PORCH \nDolph leans on the porch rail. Bucky returns. \nBUCKY Say something, Papa. Get me mad. Tell me how you can fuck this place up so bad in one month. \nDOLPH Du, Dwight? Du? \nBUCKY Speak...English. Papa, please. \nHe searches his father's eyes for a response and gets none. \nHe surveys the house again. Somewhere in the corner of his eye we see the glint of an idea... \nINSIDE THE HOUSE \nBucky on the phone. \nBUCKY ...He's had another stroke. If you could just come by and clean the place up and keep an eye on him for week or so...a hundred dollars is fine. No more than ten days. I promise. I do. Thank you. \nINT. THE POLICE BOXING GYM \nBucky leans against a wall watching Lee spar. Studying him. Mentally fighting the sparring partner's fight. \nVOICE OVER He was better than I thought. It made what came next easier. \nINT. A BANK - DAY \nBucky sits at a desk with an assistant manager and fills out forms. The manager counts out approximately $4,500 in cash. Bucky slides him the forms. The manager slides him the cash. \nINT. THE GOOD LUCK BAR - NIGHT \nBucky slides into a booth across from PETE LUKINS. \n", "test1_true": "Bucky pushes an envelope across to Pete. He looks in it. \nPETE (cont'd) I guess what I hear is correct. Then you'll be wantin' to place this with Mickey Cohen's indie. He's got Blanchard 2 to 1-- \nBUCKY I'm not bettin' on me, Pete. \nPETE (a beat) Oh. (another beat) Then as a friend I feel it's my duty to tell you this: you better make it look good. \nBUCKY Knockout between rounds eight and ten. \nPete nods his head, thinking. \nPETE Dragna's got a guy really sold on you. Even money. Best you're gonna get. \nBUCKY Thanks, Pete. \nPete sticks out his hand. \nPETE Luck. \nBUCKY Short of winning? \nPETE Luck. \nBucky takes his hand. \nINT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY \nBucky takes apart his sparring partner with a series of lightning quick counterpunches. \nVOICE OVER I'd almost finished the Police Academy when the background check turned up my father's German-American Bund membership. Pressured by the FBI goons to confirm my patriotism, I gave the Alien Squad Sam Murakawa, a guy I'd grown up with, in order to secure my LAPD appointment. \nEXT. DOLPH BLEICHERT'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBucky watches from across the street as AN OFF-DUTY NURSE tries to get Papa Bleichert to eat a sandwich. \nVOICE OVER The old fuck never knew any better. Never knew what he cost me. Or Sammy, who'd died at Manzanar. I was a good fit in the snitch's jacket and with a little alteration I slipped easily into the whole suit. \nINT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY \nBucky watches Lee spar. His quick eyes spying: \n--scar tissue over Lee's right eye \n--Lee dropping his left when throwing the right hook \n--Lee tucking his elbows too tight and opening up his ribcage \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) I had traded Warrants for a close-out on bad old debts, the eight grand I was gonna clear enough to maintain the old man in a good clean rest home for three years; the late round tank job enough to convince myself I wasn't a complete coward. \nINT. THE BOXING GYM - DAY \nKay approaches Bucky as he studies Lee. \nKAY At least he looks good with his shirt off. \nShe waves to Lee between rounds. He blows a kiss back. \nBUCKY Where's your sketch pad? \nKAY I was never very good. Ended up with a degree in History. Masters. Lee's fight money paid for it. \nBUCKY Education's an expensive habit to kick. (beat) He shouldn't have quit fighting. \nKAY I asked him to. Besides, catching animals gave him a sense of order. You have a girlfriend, Dwight? \nBUCKY Saving myself for Rita Hayworth. \nA roar from the gym onlookers. Lee's sparring partner hits the deck, blood spraying from his mouth. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Quits fighting for you. Puts you through school. Quite a guy. Quite a pair. \nKAY (flirting) We're not getting married if that's what you're wondering. \nBUCKY Why not? Shacking's against the regs. Probably cost him a stripe. \nKAY I have to go, Dwight. Good luck tomorrow night. \nBUCKY You didn't answer my question-- \nKAY (a throwaway) Lee and I don't sleep together, Dwight. \nShe keeps walking. He just stares... \nINT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA half-eaten steak and two beers gone. It's six hours later and Bucky's still thinking about Kay's exit line. Restless. He grabs his jacket. \nINT. HEARST BUILDING - HERALD-EXAMINER MORGUE - NIGHT \nBucky flashes his badge to a late-night clerk who escorts him into the newspaper's morgue. Pulls a bound stack of newspaper clippings and gives them to Bucky. He begins poring through them... \nA newspaper photo of a BANK shifts into live action: \nA GRAINY NEWSREEL-TYPE FLASHBACK (SLO-MO) \nAn armored truck idles in front of the Boulevard-Citizens Bank. Three men dressed in guard uniforms run out of the front of the bank, an alarm keening in the background. \nThree police cars converge on the scene and a gun battle ensues... Two of the bank robbers are shot as the third man (the one carrying the money) jumps into the truck. The truck takes off, able to escape when someone from inside the truck throws open the doors and pushes the naked and bound legitimate guards out the back and into the line of pursuit... \nVOICE OVER With no lead on the two escaped men, the heist quickly went from page one to page five. Two weeks later... \nA newspaper clipping headline: \"Tip from Ex-boxer cop breaks B-C Bank Job\" \nA still photo of Lee which becomes live action as... \nINT. A SMALL VENICE BEACH APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nA younger Lee and four other cops tear apart a small flat. In a closet they find BANK GUARD UNIFORMS, BANK BAGS, and a small stash of MARIJUANA. \nVOICE OVER One of Lee's snitches fingered Bobby DeWitt, a greasy little pimp with a yard long rap, as the brains behind the bank job. \nCUT TO: \nFLASHBACK: A HATCHET FACED MAN (DEWITT) LED BY HANDCUFFS THROUGH A GIANT CROWD... \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) DeWitt howled frame-up the entire trial, never ID'ing the driver or coughing up the dough, even after damning character testimony from some of his employees, including one Katherine Lake, formerly of Sioux Falls, South Dakota and looking to go straight. \nFLASHBACK: LEE LEADING KAY FROM THE COURTROOM, HAND ON HER ELBOW... \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) DeWitt got ten to life at San Quentin; Lee got Kay, or maybe the other way around. \nBACK TO PRESENT: Bucky walks through downtown L.A., hands stuffed in his pockets like James Dean... \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) They both got a few weeks in the gossip pages before Kay dove into her college education and Lee down the hero's road ending in Warrants and a shack job with a woman he loved but wouldn't touch... \nBucky passes A WHORE on the corner, their eyes meet for a moment and he walks on. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) You come off a winning fight. Sweat- drenched, tasting blood, still wanting to go. The handbooks who made money on you bring you a girl. A pro, a semi-pro. You do it in the dressing room, or a hallway. The eleventh round of a ten round fight. And when you go back to an ordinary life, it's just weakness, a loss. \nBucky turns back to give the whore a second look but she's gone. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) To a fighter, sex tastes like blood and resin and suture scrub. I wondered if some day that would ever be different. \n", "test1_id": 2172, "test2_input": "RED MANLEY I didn't hurt her-- \nHARRY SEARS Tell God! \nHarry smashes the sap down the table once more and then hurls the whole thing over onto its side. \nRed fumbles out of the chair onto his knees. He clasps his hands together-- \nRED MANLEY The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want... \nHe begins to weep. Completely broken. \nHarry turns to the one way mirror, looking straight out at his audience: self-loathing etched into his flabby, juicehound face. \nHe gives the thumbs-down sign and walks out of the room. \nOUTSIDE IN THE HALLWAY \nRuss Millard meets him at the door and leads him away from the general crowd of officers. \nBACK IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM \nBucky watches as Lee and another officer handcuff Red and take him outside. Lee has his hand on Red's shoulder like a kindly uncle. \nOUTSIDE THE STATION \nBucky stands on the steps, taking fresh air. Russ steps out. \nRUSS MILLARD Good report yesterday, Bleichert. \nBUCKY Thanks. \nRUSS MILLARD What next? \nBUCKY You send me back to Warrants? \nRUSS MILLARD Wrong again. But keep going. \nBUCKY Canvass around the Biltmore. If Red dropped her off there on the tenth maybe we can start reconstructing the last days before she got snatched. \nRUSS MILLARD Bright penny. You're doing well, Bucky. Run with the ball. \nBUCKY All I know is you should keep an eye on Loew and his boys. I didn't put it in my report, but Betty sold it outright when she needed money bad enough, and Loew's been trying to keep it kiboshed so it'll look better if he ever takes it to trial. \nRUSS MILLARD (smiles) You calling your boss an evidence suppressor? \nBUCKY And a grandstanding son of a bitch. \nRUSS MILLARD You're a brighter penny than I thought. (hands him a sheet of paper) Betty sightings. Wilshire Division. I need smart pennies to eliminate the phonies from the tip sheet. \nBUCKY What are you gonna do? \nMILLARD Keep an eye on the evidence suppressor son of a bitch and his minions to make sure they don't try to coerce a confession out of that innocent man in the holding tank. \nHe pats Bucky on the shoulder and walks inside. \nCUT TO: \nBUCKY CANVASSING THE WILSHIRE DISTRICT \nRestaurants, bars, juke joints. Bucky interviews every drunk on Western and Normandie... \nVOICE OVER Barflies. Daytime juicers...The longer I listened the more they talked about themselves, interweaving their sad tales with the Black Dahlia, who they actually believed to be a glamorous siren headed for Hollywood stardom... \nBucky cruises in his car into Lee and Kay's neighborhood. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) It was as if they would have traded their own lives for a juicy front-page death. I decided my report would consist of two words: \"All bullshit\". \nIN FRONT OF LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBucky pulls up just as Kay storms out the door and down the steps, hurling an armful of paper onto the lawn. Lee storms beside her, shouting and waving his arms as they go back inside. \nBucky walks over and kneels down besides the papers: carbons of LAPD report forms, tip sheets, evidence tickets, the autopsy...all with \"E. Short\" typed at the top. \nBUCKY Oh Jesus. \nKay and Lee come back out again, Kay tossing out more files. \nKAY It's sick and it's insane! After everything...And all that might happen-- \nLEE I need this, babe. You know it. I'll rent a room for the stuff but-- (noticing Bucky) You tell her Bucky. Reason with her. \nBUCKY She's right, Lee. You've pulled at least three misdemeanors here. It's out of control-- \nBucky stops himself short, studying Lee's strained face. \nBUCKY (cont'd) (to Kay) I promised him a week on it. Four more days and it's over. \nKAY Dwight, you can be so gutless sometimes. \nShe turns on them both and goes back inside. Before Lee can make a wisecrack Bucky kicks his way through the LAPD papers back to his car... \nINT. LAVERNE'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT \nBucky sits low in his car, watching THE WHITE PACKARD parked near the front of LaVerne's. He's been there awhile... \nFinally the woman from the night before exits and heads for her car. He jumps out and walks quickly to intercept her while she's fumbling for her keys. \nBUCKY Slumming, Miss Sprague? \nShe sighs, exasperated. \nMADELEINE I am now. Daddy spying on me again? \nShe pulls a wad of cash out of her purse. Switching to a very deft imitation of a Scotchman's burr: \nMADELEINE (cont'd) Maddy, girl, ye shouldn't be congregatin' in such unsuitable places-- \nBUCKY I'm a policeman. \nMADELEINE Well that's a new one-- \nShe peels off another bill. Hands it to Bucky. He counts it out. Over a hundred dollars. \nBUCKY Homicide. \nHe hands the money back. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Let's try Elizabeth Short. Linda Martin. \nAll of her bravado drops. Bucky sees it immediately. He grabs her purse and keys and tosses them on the hood of her car. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Here or downtown? I know you knew her so don't jerk me off on that or it's downtown and a whole lot of publicity. \nShe opens the door to her car and slides in. Bucky gets in next to her. By the roof light he can see that her similarity to the Dahlia is more in her clothes and hair, but the resemblance is still there nonetheless. \nMADELEINE (gathering herself) This is all a fluke. I met them at LaVerne's last fall. Betty maybe one time. Linda a couple. She'd come in to cadge a drink or a meal off a sister. \nBUCKY You sleep with either of them? \nMADELEINE No. Just cocktail lounge chitchat. \nBUCKY Are you lez? \n", "test2_true": "Bucky's charmed by her, but stays focused. \nBUCKY Why'd you rabbit last night? \nMADELEINE (exasperated) Mister, my father is Emmett Sprague. The Emmett Sprague. He built half of Hollywood and Long Beach, and what he didn't build he bought. Imagine the headlines. \"Tycoon's Daughter Questioned in Black Dahlia Case--Played Footsie with Dead Girl at Lesbian Nightclub\". Get the picture? \nBUCKY In Technicolor. (beat) What did you talk about? \nMADELEINE Linda talked about her boring boy back in Hicktown, Nebraska, or wherever. Betty talked about the latest issue of Screen World. Hollywood dreams, the sad nine yards. \nBUCKY Betty ever tell you about a movie she did? Show you a viewfinder? Anything specific? \nMADELEINE On a conversational level they were right down there with you, only they were better looking. \nBUCKY You're cute. \nMADELEINE You're not. Look, I'm tired. You want to hear my alibi so I can end this farce and go home? \nBUCKY That's all anyone ever wants to volunteer: the alibi. Go ahead. \nMADELEINE My family and I were at our house in Laguna from Sunday through Thursday along with our live-in servants. If you want verification, call Daddy. But be discreet about where we met. \nShe turns in the seat to face him directly. \nMADELEINE (cont'd) Don't suppose I can convince you to keep my name out of the papers? \nBUCKY I don't need your cash if that's what you're saying. \nShe touches his leg. \nMADELEINE Ah, Laddie...'S not what I'm saying... \nHe knows exactly what she's saying. \nBUCKY Convince me. \nMADELEINE Tomorrow night. Eight o'clock. My address is 482 So. Muirfield. \nBUCKY I know the address. \nMADELEINE Not surprised. Pick me up. Like a gentleman. \nHe starts to get out of the car. \nMADELEINE (cont'd) One more thing--What's your name? \nBUCKY Bucky Bleichert. \nMADELEINE I'll try to remember. \nHe pulls the purse off the hood and tosses her the keys. As he walks away he lets out a deep breath, as if he'd been holding it the whole time... \nINT. THE SQUAD ROOM - NEXT DAY \nBucky enters and finds Lee at a desk, manning the tip phones. \nLEE Yes, ma'am. I understand. A werewolf and Red Manley. Oh no. The werewolf is Red Manley. Yes that would be more efficient... \nLee dutifully writes down the crank on a routing slip. Bucky slides into a chair across from him, brushing imaginary dust off of the phone in front of him. \nLee rings off. Smiles at Bucky. \nLEE (cont'd) I love tip duty. \nBUCKY So...You smooth things with Kay? \nLEE Yeah. I rented a room for the stuff at the El Nido Motel. Nine scoots a week. Chump change if it makes her feel good. \nBUCKY De Witt gets out tomorrow, Lee. I was thinking maybe I should lean on him. Get Fritz Vogel and Koenig to do it-- \nLee swings away in his rotating chair, knocking over a wastepaper basket. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Lee-- \nThe phone in front of Lee rings. He snatches it-- \nLEE Blanchard. Homicide. \nLee listens to the call, not saying anything. It goes on for some time. Finally Bucky catches Lee's eye. Lee makes the \"looney\" sign with his finger. \nBucky's phone rings. He picks it up. \nBUCKY Bleichert. Homicide. \nThe person on the other line starts rambling on. Bucky takes notes diligently as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. THE SQUAD ROOM - LATER \nBucky's on another call. His pile of tip sheets and routing slips have grown. Behind him Lee pulls on his jacket and gives Bucky a two-fingered salute as he saunters out. \nVOICE OVER I logged forty-six phone tips, about half of which were reasonably coherent. Lee left early, dodging any talk about De Witt. Ellis Loew stuck me with writing up the summary report, most of which concerned the numerous dead end leads, bogus confessions and three hundred new Dahlia sightings per day. It left me gut certain of one thing: \nCUT TO: \nA CLOSE UP OF THE BETTING POOL TABLE \nas Bucky drops twenty dollars on \"Unsolved - pay 2 to 1\". \nINT. ANOTHER CASTING OFFICE - DAY \nElizabeth Short in another dress, her hair fixed differently. Clapsticks come in again: \"Elizabeth Short...Screen Test \nMAN #2 (O.S.) Where are you from? \nELIZABETH SHORT Boston. Massachusetts. \nMAN #2 How long have you lived here? \nELIZABETH SHORT Two years. \nMAN #2 You've lost your accent. \nELIZABETH SHORT Well, you know, when in Rome... (looks nervously into camera) Why? Do you want a girl with an accent? \nFADE OUT \nEXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT \nBucky rings the bell dressed in his Sunday best blazer. Madeleine answers, a knockout in a skirt and cashmere sweater. \nMADELEINE Look. I hate to pull this, but Daddy has heard about you. He insisted you stay for dinner. I told him we met at that art exhibit at Stanley Rose's Bookshop, so if you have to pump everybody for my alibi, be subtle. All right? \nBUCKY Sure. \nShe leads him inside. \nINT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS \nThick Persian carpets, tapestries, giant rooms with a men's club atmosphere. \nNext to the fireplace Bucky notices A STUFFED SPANIEL with a yellowed newspaper rolled into its mouth. \n", "test2_id": 2173, "test3_input": "MADELEINE (re the dog) That's Balto. The paper is the LA Times for August 1, 1926. Balto was bringing in the paper when Daddy's accountant told him he'd made his first million. Daddy wanted to consecrate the moment so he shot him. Here we go-- \nINT. A SMALL SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe Sprague family sits in matching easy chairs. No one stands up. \nMADELEINE Bucky Bleichert. May I present my family. My mother, Ramona Cathcart Sprague. My father, Emmett Sprague. My sister, Martha McConville Sprague. \nEmmett Sprague jumps to his feet, pumping Bucky's hand. \nBUCKY A pleasure, Mr. Sprague. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE Saw you fight Mondo Sanchez. Boxed the pants off him. Another Billy Conn you were. \nBUCKY Thanks. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE Mondo gave a good show. What ever happened to him? \nBUCKY Died of a heroin overdose. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE Too bad. Shamed his family. (beat) Speaking of families-- \nBoth Martha and Ramona stand up. Martha is 19, plain and serious, with a tenacious resemblance to Emmett. (Neither of whom look much like Madeleine.) \nRamona, on the other hand, possesses a pushing-fifty resemblance to Madeleine combined with the flaccid face and unfocused features of a booze or drug addict. \nRAMONA (trace of a slur) Madeleine says nice things about you. \nMADELEINE Daddy can we eat? Bucky and I want to catch a nine-thirty show. \nINT. THE DINING ROOOM - LATER \nA black maid serves large portions of corned beef and cabbage. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE Dig in, lad. Hearty fare breeds hearty people. Haute cuisine breeds degenerates. \nBucky smiles politely and begins eating. \nMARTHA I want to draw Mr. Bleichert, Daddy. \nOn Emmett's nod Martha pulls out a small sketch pad. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE You're in for a cruel caricaturing, Bucky. Maddy's my pretty one, but Martha's my certified genius. \nA wince from Martha. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE (cont'd) What kind of name is Bleichert? Dutch? \nBUCKY German. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE A great people, the Germans. Hitler was a bit excessive, but mark my words that someday we'll regret not joining forces with him to fight the Reds. I killed a lot of your countrymen during the war. \nMARTHA Did you meet Balto out in the hallway? \nBUCKY Very realistic. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE An old friend stuffed him. We were in the Scots regiment together. Georgie Tilden. He wanted to work in the flickers. \nBUCKY So when did you come here? \nEMMETT SPRAGUE 1920. Hollywood was a cow pasture, but the silent flickers was booming. Georgie got work as a lighting man, and me building houses. Georgie got me introduced to Mack Sennett and I helped him build that housing project he was putting up--Hollywoodland-- underneath that godawful sign. \nBUCKY I always loved the Keystone Kops. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE Old Mack knew how to squeeze a dollar dry, he did. He had extras moonlighting as laborers and vice versa. I used to drive 'em over to Hollywoodland after twelve hours on a Keystone Cops flicker and put in another six hours by torchlight. Even gave me as assistant director credit a couple times, so grateful he was for the way I squeezed his slaves-- \nA SCREECH interrupts Emmett's monologue. Bucky looks across the table to see Ramona trying to corral a potato with her fork (the source of the sound). \nEMMETT SPRAGUE (cont'd) Mother? Are you feeling well? Would you like to contribute to the conversation? \nRamona forks a small bit of food and chews it daintily. \nRAMONA Did you know, Mr. Bleichert, that Ramona Boulevard was named after me? \nBUCKY No Mrs. Sprague, I didn't. \nRAMONA When Emmett married me for my father's money he promised my family that he would use his influence with the City Zoning Board to have a street named after me. But all he could manage was a dead-end block in a red light district in Lincoln Heights. Are you familiar with the neighborhood, Mr. Bleichert? \nBUCKY I grew up there. \nRAMONA Then you know that the Mexican prostitutes expose themselves out of windows to attract customers. I hear many of them know Mr. Sprague by name-- \nEmmett Sprague SLAMS the table. Plates rattle. Silence. Bucky stares into his lap as Madeleine grabs his knee tightly. \nRAMONA (cont'd) I'll sing for my supper when Mayor Bowron comes to dinner, but not for Madeleine's male whores. A common policeman. My God, Emmett. How little you think of me. \nShe struggles to her feet and leaves the room. Her husband follows. \nMADELEINE I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. \nMARTHA (cheery) Mr. Bleichert? \nMartha tears a piece of paper out of her sketch pad. Bucky takes it as she walks away. \nANGLE ON THE SKETCH: \nA caricature of a naked Bucky having sex with Madeleine. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER \nA cinderblock auto court filled with pre-war jalopies. The camera closes on a dingy door. Room 11. \nINT. THE RED ARROW INN - ROOM 11 - SAME \nA single yellow light illuminates the dreary flop as Bucky and Madeleine fuck on the bed. \nMADELEINE I'm so...sorry. Don't hate my family-- don't--they're not so bad-- \nBucky grabs her hair-- \nBUCKY Not them, me. Do me. Be with me. \nFocusing, Madeleine pins Bucky with her knees and pulls him deep into her until they're no longer common policeman and rich girl slut. They're one. \nINT. THE RED ARROW INN - ROOM 11 - SAME \nThey hold each other, sweaty and spent. \nBUCKY Well. I think you kept your name out of the papers. \nMADELEINE Until we announce the wedding? \nBUCKY Your mother would love that. \nMADELEINE She's a hypocrite. She takes pills the doctor gives her, so she's not a hophead. You know how Daddy really made his money? \nBUCKY How? \nMADELEINE He bought rotten lumber and abandoned movie facades from Mack Sennett and built houses out of them. He's got firetraps all over LA registered to phony corporations...His \"good friend\" George? Disfigured in a car crash while running Daddy some errands. Daddy throws him scraps now--odd jobs tending some rental property-- \nBUCKY You don't have to tell me this-- \n", "test3_true": "BUCKY I like you, too. \nShe looks at him earnestly. \nMADELEINE Bucky, I didn't tell you all about Betty Short. \nBUCKY Jesus-- \nMADELEINE Don't be mad at me. It's nothing. I just don't want to lie to you. \nBUCKY What is it? \nMADELEINE Last summer I was bar-hopping a lot. Straight bars. I heard about a girl who looked like me. I got curious and left notes at a couple places: \"Your lookalike wants to meet you\", things like that. I left my number. She called. That's how I met her at LaVerne's with Linda. \nBUCKY And that's all of it? \nMADELEINE Yes. That's all of it. \nBUCKY Then be prepared, babe. There's fifty cops out there combing every bar in town looking for Dahlia info. You could be headed for the papers no matter what. \nMADELEINE Serve my family right. \nBUCKY You don't mean that. \nMADELEINE No. I don't. \nHe strokes her dark hair. \nBUCKY Tell me something. Why'd you want to meet Betty Short? \nMADELEINE I've worked pretty hard to be loose and free. But the way people described Betty. It sounded like she was a natural. \nBUCKY How do you mean? \nMADELEINE Hmmm...She was this poor girl...Came from nothing...But then she carried nothing with her, either. I don't know...when you're rich sometimes you romanticize the poor... \nBUCKY I wouldn't know. \nAn awkward silence as she considers her foot in her mouth. He studies her for a moment. Pulls her close, kisses her mouth...the arch of her neck...They begin to move together again... \nAnother LAPD FORM: \"Witness Report: Lorna Martikova...aka Linda Martin...\" \nEXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - MOVING \nBucky weaves fast through traffic. He whips a right turn... \nEXT. THE CALEDONIA LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS \nBucky's car screeches into the parking lot just as LINDA MARTIN bursts through the doors and takes off running. \nBucky jumps from the car and sprints after her, the girl clutching an oversized purse to her chest as she dashes in and out of busy traffic. \nThe girl runs like a fucking antelope as Bucky barely misses being hit by a large BEER TRUCK and gets to the other side of the street just as Linda stumbles over a curb--sending her sprawling on the sidewalk. \nBucky jumps on her, grabbing her tiny fists as she kicks and screams like a hell cat. \nHe cuffs her and pulls her up, dragging her to where she spilled her purse. \nLINDA MARTIN I'm an emancipated minor and if you touch me without a matron present I'll sue you! \nHe picks it up her purse. Surprised by the heft, he opens it and pulls out A METAL FILM CAN. \nHer demeanor changes instantly to fear: \nLINDA MARTIN (near tears) Please, mister...My...my parents. \nINT. JUVENILE DETENTION HALL - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER \nRuss, Harry and Bucky sit opposite Linda Martin. She's pretty and small, and about to get smaller... \nRUSS MILLARD ...and you don't recall any of the names Betty went out with last fall? \nLINDA MARTIN They were just pickups. \nRUSS MILLARD No one who would do her harm? \nThe girl thinks hard, shakes her head \"no\". \nBUCKY You made the casting rounds together. Ever get any movie work? \nLINDA MARTIN No. \nBUCKY So what about the film can? \nHer eyes go to the floor, tears begin to drop. \nLINDA MARTIN It's...a movie. \nBUCKY A dirty movie? \nShe nods her head silently. \nRUSS MILLARD You have to tell us the whole thing, sweetheart. So think it through. \nHarry pours her a paper cup of water. She takes a sip. \nLINDA MARTIN I was...cadging at a bar in Gardena. This Mexican man - Raoul or Jorge or something - starting talking to me. I thought I was pregnant, and I was desperate wicked bad for money. He said he'd give me two hundred dollars to act in a nudie film. \nShe takes a large gulp of water. \nLINDA MARTIN (cont'd) He said he needed another girl so I asked Betty. The three of us drove down to Tijuana and we made the movie at this big house outside of town. (beat) Then he drove us back to LA. \nHer head bowed. Russ and Harry stare at her impassively. \nBUCKY Was this around Thanksgiving? \nShe nods yes. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Did the Mex give Betty a viewfinder? \nShe raises her head in recognition and nods yes. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Did he seem particularly interested in Betty? Did she see him again? \nShe shakes her head \"no\". \nBUCKY (cont'd) But you saw him again, didn't you? How else could you have gotten a copy? \nLinda looks sadly at Bucky. \nLINDA MARTIN After Betty...After I read about Betty...I went looking for him in Gardena. He was about to go back to Mexico and I conned him out of a print. \nRUSS MILLARD Where was that? \nLINDA MARTIN I don't remember. On Aviation somewhere. \nRUSS MILLARD Why would you do that? \nLINDA MARTIN A Black Dahlia stag film? I thought...I could sell it if I had to. (ashamed) It was...a collector's item. \nRUSS MILLARD And he willingly gave you a copy of the film? For nothing? \nLINDA MARTIN No. Not for nothing. \n", "test3_id": 2174}

{"train": "The Black Dahlia \nWritten by \nJosh Friedman \nBased on the novel by \nJames Ellroy \nCREDITS ROLL OVER \nBlack and white newsreel footage from the 1930s. Clips from prize fights featuring two different boxers against various opponents. One a light heavyweight--pure finesse, a counterpunches; the other, stouter and stronger, a headhunting puncher. \nThe intercutting of the two fighters suggests a possible showdown at the end of the newsreel. No such luck. \nEND CREDITS \nCLOSE UP ON: \nA TRIPLE CARBON LAPD \"INCIDENT REPORT\" FORM trapped in an old Corona typewriter. The keys pound letters into the blank spaces. \nINCIDENT: THE ZOOT SUIT RIOTS...JUNE 10, 1943... REPORTING OFFICER...DWIGHT \"BUCKY\" BLEICHERT \nEXT. BOYLE HEIGHTS - EVERGREEN AND WABASH - DUSK \nA WORLD WAR II ERA PERSONNEL CARRIER transports twenty silent LAPD officers into the heart of downtown Los Angeles. The sounds of glass breaking and men screaming serves as backdrop for their arrival. \nWe focus in on BUCKY BLEICHERT, 26, (The counterpuncher from the newsreels) as he jumps from the carrier. \nBucky's minus his gun but plus a WWI tin helmet and a three pound truncheon. \nBUCKY'S POV: \nHundreds of in-uniform GI's use baseball bats and two-by- fours to beat the shit out of Zoot Suit-wearing Mexicans. \nMost of the cops wander to the edge of the race riot and hobnob with the pockets of MPs and Shore Patrol who've chosen to \"restore order\" by cheering on their countrymen against the outnumbered but equally fierce zooters. \nSailors shatter streetlights and shop windows. Darkness falls quickly on what Bucky rightly realizes is chaos. \nSuddenly Bucky's RUNNING-- \naway from the action... \ndown a side street and onto a \nQUIET RESIDENTIAL BLOCK. \nHe slows to a jog, trying to gather his thoughts. And then a voice: \nVOICE Bleichert! Bleichert! \nEXT. A BUNGALOW COURTYARD - SAME \nA POLICE OFFICER has THREE MARINES IN DRESS BLUES and ONE ZOOT SUITER cornered in a center walkway. \nThe marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their two-by- fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet, dodging the blows like the ex-fighter he is. \nVOICE OVER I already knew him by reputation, had our respective records down pat: Lee Blanchard, 43-4-2 as a heavyweight, formerly a regular attraction at the Hollywood Legion Stadium. \nThe terrified Mexican stands frozen on one side of Blanchard, trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the marines' blows with his own truncheon. \nLEE BLANCHARD Code three, Bleichert! \nBucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in, fending off the marines' blows to jab at them with his stick. \nVOICE OVER And he knew me, Bucky Bleichert, light- heavy, 36-0-0, ranked tenth by Ring magazine in 1937 fighting no-name opponents in no-man's-land division. \nOn instinct, Bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the marines with his fists, connecting hard punches with soft midsections. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) In our first year at Central we'd never spoke--but people spoke of us. Opinions about a fantasy Bleichert-Blanchard fight, and who would win. \nAnd now Blanchard moves in, lashing vicious truncheon blows to the shoulders of the marines, sending them one by one into a heap. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) I'd heard almost all of 'em: Blanchard by early KO; Bleichert by decision; Blanchard stopped on cuts--everything but Bleichert by knockout. \nThe marines reduced to rubble, Lee Blanchard turns his attention to the Zooter: he slaps handcuffs on him and leads him away. He motions for Bucky to follow. \nLee turns back to the marines: \nLEE To the halls of Tripoli, shitbirds. \nOne of them flips Lee off. The Zooter kicks him in the chest as Lee pulls him away from them, laughing. \nThe three men start back toward the riots. Gunshots can be heard. Palm trees blaze up into the night. \nLEE (cont'd) (re the Zooter) Bucky Bleichert, meet Senor Tomas Dos Santos, subject of an all-points fugitive warrant for manslaughter committed during the commission of a Class B Felony. Snatched a purse off a hairbag and she keeled of a heart attack. \nBUCKY You come all the way down here to roust-- \nLEE (smiling) I came all the way down here same as you did. (jerks a finger to the riots) Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar-- (nudging Dos Santos) Habla Ingles, Tomas? \nThe man shakes his head \"no\". \nLEE (cont'd) He's dead meat. Manslaughter Two's a gas chamber jolt for spics. Hepcat here's about six weeks away from the Big Adios. Been better off getting a couple cracked ribs from our Privates First Class back there. \nBlanchard spies a home with newspapers stacked on the front porch. \nLEE (cont'd) We'll never get him booked tonight. \nCUT TO: \nLEE JIMMYING THE FRONT DOOR... \nINT. THE KITCHEN - LATER \nTomas Dos Santos cuffed by his ankles to a radiator. The three men are on their second fifth of Cutty Sark swiped from the kitchen cupboard. \nDos Santos sings a drunken Spanish version of \"The Chattanooga Choo Choo\" before slumping to his side and passing out. \nBucky covers him with a blanket. \nLEE Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle. \nBUCKY (not impressed) Impressive. \nLEE (not impressed either) Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you could take me. \nLee gets up and wanders into the living room. From the kitchen Bucky watches Lee stare out at the flames. \nBUCKY Whatta we do about the Mex? \nLEE We'll take 'em in the morning. \nBUCKY You'll take him. \nLEE He's half yours, partner. \nBUCKY He's all yours. And I'm not your partner. \nLEE (without turning) Someday. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nBUCKY Uh, yes sir. \nEXT. THE CITY HALL PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATEER \nBucky exits and sees Lee leaning against an unmarked car talking with a striking woman in an auburn pageboy cut. \nLee waves Bucky over. \nLEE Bucky I'd like you to meet Kay Lake. \nBUCKY Hello. \nFAY I saw you fight a couple times. You won. \nBUCKY I always won. You a fight fan? \nKAY Lee used to drag me. I was taking somme art classes so I'd sketch the boxers. \nLee puts his arm around her. \nLEE Made me quit fighting the smokers. Didn't want me doin' the \"vegetable shuffle.\" \nHe staggers around like a punch-drunk fighter. \nBUCKY I'll try not to hurt you. \nA flicker of anger in her eyes. \nLEE Sure make Loew happy. \nBUCKY He's got money on me, I gather? \nLEE Seems that way. \nBUCKY And if I win I get Warrants? \nLEE Seems that way. \nBucky shakes his head. Turns to Kay. \nBUCKY What do you think of all this, Miss Lake? \nKAY For moral reasons I hope the LAPD gets ridiculed for perpetrating this farce. For financial reasons I hope Lee wins. And for aesthetic reasons I hope you both look good with your shirts off. \nBucky and Lee break into laughter. Bucky sticks out his hand. Lee takes it. \nBUCKY Luck short of winning. \nLEE You, too. \nBucky tips his hat to Kay and turns to go. \nKAY Luck, Dwight. \nHe stops at hearing his real name. But he knows she's waiting to see his reaction so he keeps walking... \nBUCKY'S BOXING MONTAGE \n--Bucky hits the heavy bag in the police gym while Lee spars in the background \nVOICE OVER The 77th Street lieutenant tapped as official LAPD bookmaker had Lee as an early 3 to 1 favorite... \n--Bucky runs through Elysian Park with two pound weights on his ankles. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) ...while the real bookie line had Mr. Fire favored by knockout at 2 1/2 to 1, and decision by 5 to 3. \n--Bucky spars with a fighter, peppering him with jab after jab. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) Even the dicks in Ad Vice had suspended bookie shakedowns because Mickey Cohen was raking ten grand a day and kickin' back five percent to the advertising agency promoting the bond issue. \n--Cops exchange betting markers during roll call... \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) I was a local celebrity again. \nEXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - LINCOLN HEIGHTS - DAY \nBucky pulls up in front of a small ugly house in a tired neighborhood. He exits the car carrying a cardboard box full of canned goods and old girlie magazines. \nON THE PORCH OF THE HOUSE \na bony old man sits in a broken chair, aiming a BB pistol at some balsa wood airplanes scattered in the yard. \nON BUCKY'S FACE \ndisgust and sadness. \nThis is DOLPH BLEICHERT, Bucky's father. Bucky approaches, pulling a chair up next to his father. Up close it's even worse: white skin stretched tight over blue veins, yellow rimming his rheumy eyes. Flecks of dirt and vomit on a filthy shirt. \nBUCKY Papa? \nDOLPH Guten tag, Dwight. \nBUCKY Speak English, papa. \nDOLPH Englisch Schiesser! Amerikan Schiesser! \nHe aims the BB gun and fires at an airplane: the gun's empty. \nBucky enters the house. Half-eaten cans of beans on the dining room table, an entire legion of broken balsa wood airplane kits. Alley cats wander in and out of the kitchen, nosing their faces into open tuna fish cans... \nBACK ON THE PORCH \nDolph leans on the porch rail. Bucky returns. \nBUCKY Say something, Papa. Get me mad. Tell me how you can fuck this place up so bad in one month. \nDOLPH Du, Dwight? Du? \nBUCKY Speak...English. Papa, please. \nHe searches his father's eyes for a response and gets none. \nHe surveys the house again. Somewhere in the corner of his eye we see the glint of an idea... \nINSIDE THE HOUSE \nBucky on the phone. \nBUCKY ...He's had another stroke. If you could just come by and clean the place up and keep an eye on him for week or so...a hundred dollars is fine. No more than ten days. I promise. I do. Thank you. \nINT. THE POLICE BOXING GYM \nBucky leans against a wall watching Lee spar. Studying him. Mentally fighting the sparring partner's fight. \nVOICE OVER He was better than I thought. It made what came next easier. \nINT. A BANK - DAY \nBucky sits at a desk with an assistant manager and fills out forms. The manager counts out approximately $4,500 in cash. Bucky slides him the forms. The manager slides him the cash. \nINT. THE GOOD LUCK BAR - NIGHT \nBucky slides into a booth across from PETE LUKINS. \nCUT TO: \nA HAMMER HITTING A BELL \nand the fight is on. \nINSIDE THE PACKED ACADEMY GYM \nCops and mobsters sit shoulder to shoulder, cigar smoke like L.A. haze as \nLEE CHARGES BUCKY, the big man trying to cut of the ring. Bucky engages, dodging Lee's thundering blows and peppering back with counterpunches... \n**The general fight storyline is this: a very even and brutal match see-sawing back and forth, Bucky doing all he can to make it into the middle rounds. Somewhere around the fourth or fifth round his competitive juices take over and he begins trying to win at all costs. The two men hurt each other badly, and in the eighth round it's anybody's fight. Bucky punches toe-to-toe with Lee, abandoning his strategy. Lee knocks Bucky out. \nINT. BUCKY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nBucky lies in bed, radio playing jazz. He looks horrible-- face swollen, lip split, stitches across his nose. He sips whiskey from a bottle through a straw. \nThe phone rings and rings. He refuses to answer it... \nINT. A REST HOME - ANOTHER DAY \nBucky, bruised but somewhat better, stands in the hallway of a very nice rest home. He surreptitiously watches his father as the old man tries to grab at a nurse. \nEXT. THE REST HOME - MINUTES LATER \nPete Lukins waits outside on the porch for Bucky. \nPETE Well? \nBUCKY He'll catch on soon enough. \nThe scene widens behind the two men and we see the sign on the facility: \nKING DAVID VILLA \nJewish stars adorn the sign. \nINT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nBucky stands in front of his mirror clipping at his stitches with scissors. He hears a voice outside his window. \nVOICE OVER Hey. Canvasback! \nBucky recognizes the voice and goes to the window. \nEXT. THE COURTYARD - SAME \nLee Blanchard, his own bruises fading, stands in the yard. \nLEE You gonna hide in there another week? Ain't you bored yet? \nBUCKY Gettin' there. \nLEE Wanna work Warrants with me? \nBUCKY What? \nLEE Harrell's been callin' to tell you. You been hibernating-- \nBUCKY But I lost. Loew's deal-- \nLEE Don't you read the papers? The bond issue passed yesterday. Want the job, partner? \nOff Lee's devilish grin: \nVOICE OVER Mister Fire. Mister Ice. The hero and the snitch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CENTRAL WARRANTS - MORNING \nA door marked \"DETECTIVE'S MUSTER ROOM\". Bucky, wearing his best SPORTS COAT AND SLACKS, pushes through the door. \nINSIDE THE MUSTER ROOM \nFull of the LAPD's plainclothes hotshots. All stand and give Bucky a standing ovation. Lee's there, too, playing to the crowd. \nOn the blackboard at the front of the room: 8%!!! \nCAPTAIN JACK TIERNEY is at the podium. \nTIERNEY (as introduction) Officer Bleichert, the men of Central Dicks, Homicide, Ad Vice, Bunco, et cetera. I'm Captain Jack Tierney. You and Lee are the white men of the hour, so I hope you enjoyed your ovation. You won't get another one until you retire. \nEveryone laughs. Tierney raps the podium and speaks again. \nTIERNEY (cont'd) Enough horseshit. This is the felony summary for the week ending November 14, 1946. First, three liquor store stickups... \nTierney begins the summary as Bucky's eyes wander around the room, taking in his new surroundings... Older men, coats and ties... He tunes back in... \nTIERNEY (cont'd) And here's a collar'd please Cap'n Jack to no end. Sergeants Vogel, Koenig, have you read the SID memos on the Bunker Hill burglaries? \nFRITZ VOGEL AND BILL KOENIG, both hulking and unpleasant- looking (Fritzie being the elder version of his son Johnny). The two men shake their heads \"no\". Tierney disapproves. \nTIERNEY (cont'd) Set of latents at the last break-in ID's one Maynard Coleman, two sodomy priors. A surefire baby raper. Highland Park's got four child sodomy unsolveds. Maybe he's our boy, maybe not. But between that and the B&E's I'd put Maynard as a high priority lamster right now. There's a list of his known associates on the bulletin board. Let's all take a look... \nINT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER \nThe meeting's breaking up. A tall, elegant man (RUSS MILLARD) and a squat disheveled man (HARRY SEARS) approach Bucky. \nRUSS MILLARD (introducing himself) Russ Millard, homicides. Wife and kids thank you for the raise, Officer. \nBucky smiles a dumb smile, not knowing what to say. \nRUSS MILLARD (cont'd) (re the other man) My partner, Harry Sears. \nHARRY (stuttering) Y-y-y-yes.  Th-th-thanks Officer B-B- Bleichert. \nBefore Bucky can answer ELLIS LOEW grabs him by the elbow and leads him away. \nELLIS LOEW Officer Bleichert. Welcome to Central Warrants-- \nWhen he gets him out of ear shot: \nELLIS LOEW (cont'd) You shouldn't have slugged with him. You were ahead on all three cards. \nBUCKY The proposition passed, sir. \nELLIS LOEW Yes but some of your patron's lost money. Play things smarter here. Don't blow this like you blew the fight. \nBucky's about to respond when Lee saves him-- \nLEE Ready to roll, canvasback? \nHe grabs Bucky and they head out the door. \nINT. LEE'S CAR - LATER \nLee cruises them through downtown, rambling about the job description. \nBUCKY Why'd you really quit fighting? \nHe pulls the car into a parking lot of a Mexican restaurant. \nBUCKY Hm? \nFAY The house. You and Lee partners. Fairy tale. \nBUCKY Can't say I believe in fairy tales. \nKAY Then you've never really had to. Lucky man. (beat) Lee! Dinner! \nINT. THE DINING ROOM - LATER \nThe food is finished. So is a bottle of champagne. Kay pops another one, hitting Lee in the chest with the cork. Everyone laughs hysterically. They fill the glasses again. \nLEE A toast...To Proposition B! \nBUCKY To the Bleichert/Blanchard rematch! Bigger than Louis/Schmeling! \nKAY To fairy tales! \nBUCKY (abruptly, drunk) To...us! \nHe's referring to all three of them--something which doesn't escape or displease anyone. They clink glasses and drink. \nANOTHER LAPD TRIPLE CARBON INCIDENT REPORT: \nJANUARY 10, 1947...Raymond \"Junior\" Nash... \nINT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING \nLee and Bucky enter the Loew's inner sanctum where they are joined by Russ Millard and Harry Sears. A stack of L.A. \nHeralds sit on the desk, the top one folded to the headline: \"Criminal Division's DA to try for Boss's Job in '48 Primary?\" \nBucky's look of disgust says it all just as Loew walks into the room-- \nLEE Goin' into politics, Ellis? Give us a quote. (as FDR) \"The only thing to fear is fear itself.\" \nLoew smiles thinly and hands over a photo and a rap sheet. \nELLIS LOEW Here's the man to fear. \nANGLE ON THE MUG SHOT AND RAP SHEET: \nRAYMOND \"JUNIOR\" NASH:  Statutory raps, armed robbery, felony mayhem...Texas State Prison...Alcatraz... \nThe cops are impressed. \nBUCKY Give us the good news. He's in LA and actin' uppity? \nELLIS LOEW Witnesses made him at a stickup near Leimert Park over the weekend. Pistol- whipped an old lady. She died about an hour ago. \nRUSS MILLARD Anything common in the sex beefs? \nELLIS LOEW Negro girls. Young ones. All the complainants have been colored. \nLEE Seeya in Leimert Park. \nAs they walk out... \nELLIS LOEW Sergeant Blanchard? Try not to kill the man. I'd like to do it in court. \nLee flashes a demon smile. \nEXT. CRENSHAW BOULEVARD - DAY - LATER \nA montage of shots as Lee and Bucky cruise south on Crenshaw Boulevard. The beginning of the post-war boom. \nVOICE OVER From November through the New Year, Lee and I captured a total of eleven hard felons, eighteen traffic warrantees and three parole and probation absconders... \nOn Crenshaw's northern end, once grand and now dilapidated houses in the process of demolition, their faces replaced by giant billboards advertising department stores, jumbo shopping centers and movie theaters. \nVOICE OVER After tours of duty, Lee and I would go to the house and find Kay. Sometimes she made dinner for us, other times the three of us would go dancing, or see a flick. \nSouthbound, older wooden structures looking more and more unkempt. Empty lots... \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) Always she'd be there, never in between us, but always in the middle. It was the best time of my life. \nEXT./INT. THE CAR - A FILLING STATION - CONTINUOUS \nLee pulls the car into the parking lot. Jumping out of the car-- \nLEE This grand tour stuff's for shit. I'm callin' in some favors. \nHe heads to a payphone and beings pumping coins into it. \nBACK IN THE CAR - MINUTES LATER \nLee gets back in the car. He's pale, sweating. \nLEE Got a tip. Snitch a mine says he's shacking with some poon in a crib near Slauson and Hoover. \nBUCKY It's all colored down there-- \nLEE We fuckin' roll. \nHe pulls out. \nCUT TO: \nEXT./INT. THE CAR - HOOVER AVE - MINUTES LATER \nLee and Bucky roll up on four men loitering on a corner. Three are black and one is white. \nLEE Hopheads. Let's shake 'em for an address or a name. \nAs Lee and Bucky exit the car, the four men immediately start the slow walk to the wall, arms over their heads. The white guy glances at Lee: \nWHITE HOPHEAD What the---Blanchard? \nLEE Shut up, shitbird. \nLee pushes him closer to the wall and starts frisking him. Bucky starts with one of the other men, pulling out some marijuana cigarettes. \nOut of the corner of his eye, Bucky sees the black man closest to Lee reaches for something shiny in his belt-- \nBUCKY Partner! \nBucky pulls his .38... \nTHE WHITE GUY swings around and LEE SHOOTS HIM twice in the face-- \nTHE FIRST BLACK MAN pulls a SHIV free and BUCKY SHOOTS HIM in the neck-- \nANOTHER OF THE MEN goes for his trousers, fumbling for something as BUCKY SHOOTS HIM THREE TIMES. \nLEE Bucky duck! \nBucky hits the cement and gets an upside down view of Lee and the last man drawing guns on each other--Lee's three shots cutting down the man before he can fire his tiny derringer. \nBucky pulls himself to his feet, stumbling past the blood- covered sidewalk and vomits in the gutter. \nFROM THE DISTANCE: THE SOUND OF SIRENS. \nBucky pulls out his badge and pins it to his jacket pocket. Behind him, Lee is busy turning the dead men's pockets inside out--scattering shivs and reefers onto the sidewalk away from the blood. \nThe two men walk out, disgusted. \nLEE Jesus fuck. We just got handed the entire U.S. Armed forces as suspects. \nBUCKY Flip to see who writes it up? \nLEE I'm staking Nash's pad for the night. See if we get any strange drive-bys at the murder sight. Do me a favor and drop in on Kay. She's worried about me. \nBUCKY She's a smart woman. \nINT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBucky opens the front door to find Kay reading a book on the couch. She doesn't even look up. \nKAY Hi, Dwight. \nBUCKY How'd you know it was me? \nKAY Lee stomps, you tread lightly. \nBucky appreciates her subtext. \nBUCKY Lee's-- \nKAY Let me guess...Lee's up all night-- probably on Benzedrine again--working that poor girl's murder-- \nShe says this as fact, not judgement. She knows him. \nKAY You're worried about him. And he's worried about me. (beat) But who's worried about you? Is that left for me? \nBUCKY No need for that. \nKAY For such a cautious man you're quite a hardcase. \nBUCKY It's just...He's done a lot for me. \nKay smiles, sweeps her arms around the perfect living room as if to reinforce to Bucky all Lee's done for her. \nThe point is not lost on him. \nShe crosses to him and kisses him softly on the cheek. \nKAY (cont'd) Good night. \nINT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nBucky sits at their kitchen table, eating a ham sandwich with a glass of milk and filling out the police reports. \nINT. THE HOMICIDE BULLPEN - MORNING \nBucky walks in reading the Herald front page: A picture of Elizabeth Short in a striking black dress. Underneath:\"The Black Dahlia\". \nHe stops at a room where two detectives are sorting through a steamer trunk full of letters and assorted personal effects. \nRUSS MILLARD (O.S.) (re trunk) Found it in storage down at the railway. Carbons of mash notes to sailors. Hundreds of 'em. \nBucky shows him the newspaper. \nRUSS MILLARD Thank our friend Bevo Means at the Herald. Bevo's painting Betty and her black dress like some actress in that Alan Ladd movie, The Blue Dahlia. Should triple our confessions. \nBUCKY Great. \nRUSS MILLARD (cont'd) Hollywood will fuck you when no else will. What do you think? \nBUCKY I think I want to go back to Warrants. \nRUSS MILLARD No dice. You're a bright penny and I want you here. (hands him a piece of paper) Betty's last known residences and KA's. Go to University Station and pick up Bill Koenig. Fritzie's sick. Keep Bill on a tight leash, and you write the report because Billy's practically illiterate. \nBUCKY Lieutenant-- \nRUSS MILLARD Call me Russ and get out of here. \nMillard gestures for him to leave. \nEXT. AN APARTMENT HOUSE - LATER \nBucky and Koenig walk up to the steps of an apartment house. \nBUCKY How do you want to play this, Sarge? \nKOENIG Fritzie usually does the talking and I stand back up. (re a leather sap in his belt) Muscle job? \nBUCKY Let's try talk job. \nBucky checks names on the doorbells against a couple names on his piece of paper. He stops at \"S. Saddon\". \nINT. THE HALLWAY UPSTAIRS - LATER \nBucky knocks on the door. \nBUCKY Miss Saddon? \nA young woman dressed in a metallic Egyptian costume opens the door. \nSHERYL You the driver from RKO? \nBUCKY Police. \nThe woman shuts the door. Seconds later the TOILET FLUSHES. She returns and opens it again. \nSHERYL If this is about those jaywalking-- \nBUCKY It's about Elizabeth Short. \nSHERYL I did all this on the phone this morning. Nine thousand questions about Betty's nine thousand boyfriends and I don't remember any of the names. Can I go now? The extras truck is due any minute. \nBUCKY How about you sit dawn and answer my questions or I bust you for the reefer you flushed. \nShe lets him in and sits defiantly. \nBUCKY (cont'd) First question. Does a... (re to his paper) Linda Martin or a Marjorie Graham live here? \nSHERYL That's Betty's other place. DeLongpre and Orange. \nBUCKY She moved around quite a bit. You know why? Was somebody threatening her? \nSHERYL Betty's problem wasn't enemies. It was too many friends. \nBUCKY I've gathered that. Let's change the subject. \nSHERYL How 'bout \"the world of high finance\"? \nBUCKY (cont'd) How about movies? You girls are all tryin' to break in, right? \nSHERYL (re her extras costume) I'm in mister. \nBUCKY Congratulations. What about Betty? \nSHERYL Maybe once. Maybe not. 'Round Thanksgiving she showed up bragging about gettin' her big break...Had one of those viewfinders around her neck? But who knows where she really got it. Betty had a tendency to-- \nBUCKY ...stretch the truth? \nSHERYL Lie. \nCLOSE-UPS OF BLACK DAHLIA CRIME SCENE PHOTOS \nspread out on Lee and Kay's dining room table. \nBucky stands just inside the door watching Lee study the photos, Kay a pace or two back, smoking nervously. Neither of them seem to notice him. Finally Kay sees him: \nKAY Hi, Dwight. \nLEE (wired) It ain't a random job. Horseshit. Guy who did this...hated her. Bad. Wanted the whole goddamn world to know. Babe, you took pre-Med, whattya think? Mad doctor? \nKAY Lee, Dwight's here. \nLEE Oh, hey partner. Bucky listen to Kay. Babe's got ideas. Good stuff-- \nKAY This kind of theorizing's nonsense, but I'll give you a theory if you'll eat something to calm yourself down. \nLEE Theory on, teach. \nKAY Well. Just a guess. But maybe there were two killers. Because the torture cuts are crude, while the bisection and the cut on the abdomen are neat and clean... \nCLOSE ON: Lee's face, somehow both intense and unfocused... \nVOICE OVER Three days 'til Bobby De Witt hit LA. Three days since we killed four men. \nBACK ON: BUCKY, who turns on his heels and exits, catching Kay's eye as he goes. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) Maybe nobody cared. Maybe they cared too much. \nEXT. 39TH AND NORTON - DUSK - LATER \nBucky cruises by the crime scene. Rubberneckers gawk around the vacant lot while vendors peddle greasy food and cheap portrait glossies of the Dahlia in a black dress. \nINT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - BUCKY'S DESK - NIGHT \nBucky sits at his desk staring at RAYMOND NASH'S MUGSHOT. \nHIS EYES DRIFT TO: \nA WAGER POOL SIGN-UP LIST POSTED ON THE WALL: a crude felt craps table with various betting spaces: \"Solved--2 to 1\", \"Random Sex Job--4 to 1\", \"Uhsolved--Even Money\", \"Boyfriend(s)--l to 4\"... \nNext to it are TWO HALVES OF A BLACK DRESS on separate hangers...a crude joke. \nBucky opens up his desk drawer and drops the Nash mugshot inside. He dials the phone: \nBUCKY Administrative Vice Squad? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE SWANK SPOT LOUNGE - THE VALLEY - NIGHT \nBucky pulls his car up to a low-slung building with a log- cabin facade and swinging Western doors. He enters. \nINT. THE SWANK SPOT LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS \nA dimly lit LESBIAN BAR. Butch women in GI khakis mix with soft girls in cashmere skirt suits. \nBucky approaches a bartender. The woman sizes him up and slides him a whiskey. \nBARTENDER Beverage Control? \nBUCKY (downing the whiskey) LAPD Homicide. \nBARTENDER Who got snuffed? \nBucky slides her a photo of the Dahlia and Linda Martin's ID. \nBUCKY Seen either of 'em? \nBARTENDER Huh. The Dahlia's a sister? \nBUCKY You tell me. \nBARTENDER Never seen her 'cept in the papers. And the little schoolgirl twist I've never seen. We don't truck with underaged stuff. Capice? \nBUCKY Capice when your girls tell me that. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE BAR - SOON AFTER \nas the photos are passed from patron to patron. Aside from a few raised eyebrows over the Dahlia, nothing to indicate anyone knows anything. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. A DIFFERENT LESBIAN BAR - LATER \nThis time an Olde English motif. Bucky sips another free whiskey as a dozen more women pass the photos around. Bucky watches their reactions closely but doesn't see anything out of the ordinary. \nHe takes another shot of whiskey and heads out the door. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LAVERNE'S HIDEWAY - LATER \nA tropical motif. Faux bamboo wrap-around booths shield women snuggled deep into the dark corners. \nA bit buzzed and embarrassed to have to go booth to booth and break up couples, Bucky slowly makes his way around the bar with the two photos. More of the same... \nHe approaches a woman polishing glasses at the bar. Slides over the photos. \nBUCKY Black Dahlia. \nBARTENDER No shit. \nHe taps a finger onto Linda Martin's ID. \nBUCKY What about this girl? \nThe bartender picks up the card and squints at it. Bucky sees a flicker of recognition in her eyes. She hesitates-- \nBARTENDER Never seen her. \nHe leans over the counter. \nBUCKY Don't you fuckin' lie to me. She's fifteen fucking years old. So you come clean or I slap a contributing beef on you, and you spend the next five years servin' raisinjack to bulldykes in Tehachapi. \nThe bartender looks again at the ID card. \nBARTENDER A couple times. Two, three months ago. Just to cadge drinks off the sisters, though. She liked boys, I'm sure. And not the Dahlia. Never. \nOut of his peripheral vision Bucky sees another woman just starting to sit down on a bar stool but at the last minute, change her mind and make for the door. \nA baby spotlight catches her face; a fleeting resemblance to Elizabeth Short. \nBucky takes a deep breath, counts to ten and then goes out after the woman. \nEXT. THE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS \nThe woman gets into a beautiful snow-white Packard. \nCUT TO: \nSHOTS OF VARIOUS STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nRED MANLEY I didn't hurt her-- \nHARRY SEARS Tell God! \nHarry smashes the sap down the table once more and then hurls the whole thing over onto its side. \nRed fumbles out of the chair onto his knees. He clasps his hands together-- \nRED MANLEY The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want... \nHe begins to weep. Completely broken. \nHarry turns to the one way mirror, looking straight out at his audience: self-loathing etched into his flabby, juicehound face. \nHe gives the thumbs-down sign and walks out of the room. \nOUTSIDE IN THE HALLWAY \nRuss Millard meets him at the door and leads him away from the general crowd of officers. \nBACK IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM \nBucky watches as Lee and another officer handcuff Red and take him outside. Lee has his hand on Red's shoulder like a kindly uncle. \nOUTSIDE THE STATION \nBucky stands on the steps, taking fresh air. Russ steps out. \nRUSS MILLARD Good report yesterday, Bleichert. \nBUCKY Thanks. \nRUSS MILLARD What next? \nBUCKY You send me back to Warrants? \nRUSS MILLARD Wrong again. But keep going. \nBUCKY Canvass around the Biltmore. If Red dropped her off there on the tenth maybe we can start reconstructing the last days before she got snatched. \nRUSS MILLARD Bright penny. You're doing well, Bucky. Run with the ball. \nBUCKY All I know is you should keep an eye on Loew and his boys. I didn't put it in my report, but Betty sold it outright when she needed money bad enough, and Loew's been trying to keep it kiboshed so it'll look better if he ever takes it to trial. \nRUSS MILLARD (smiles) You calling your boss an evidence suppressor? \nBUCKY And a grandstanding son of a bitch. \nRUSS MILLARD You're a brighter penny than I thought. (hands him a sheet of paper) Betty sightings. Wilshire Division. I need smart pennies to eliminate the phonies from the tip sheet. \nBUCKY What are you gonna do? \nMILLARD Keep an eye on the evidence suppressor son of a bitch and his minions to make sure they don't try to coerce a confession out of that innocent man in the holding tank. \nHe pats Bucky on the shoulder and walks inside. \nCUT TO: \nBUCKY CANVASSING THE WILSHIRE DISTRICT \nRestaurants, bars, juke joints. Bucky interviews every drunk on Western and Normandie... \nVOICE OVER Barflies. Daytime juicers...The longer I listened the more they talked about themselves, interweaving their sad tales with the Black Dahlia, who they actually believed to be a glamorous siren headed for Hollywood stardom... \nBucky cruises in his car into Lee and Kay's neighborhood. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) It was as if they would have traded their own lives for a juicy front-page death. I decided my report would consist of two words: \"All bullshit\". \nIN FRONT OF LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBucky pulls up just as Kay storms out the door and down the steps, hurling an armful of paper onto the lawn. Lee storms beside her, shouting and waving his arms as they go back inside. \nBucky walks over and kneels down besides the papers: carbons of LAPD report forms, tip sheets, evidence tickets, the autopsy...all with \"E. Short\" typed at the top. \nBUCKY Oh Jesus. \nKay and Lee come back out again, Kay tossing out more files. \nKAY It's sick and it's insane! After everything...And all that might happen-- \nLEE I need this, babe. You know it. I'll rent a room for the stuff but-- (noticing Bucky) You tell her Bucky. Reason with her. \nBUCKY She's right, Lee. You've pulled at least three misdemeanors here. It's out of control-- \nBucky stops himself short, studying Lee's strained face. \nBUCKY (cont'd) (to Kay) I promised him a week on it. Four more days and it's over. \nKAY Dwight, you can be so gutless sometimes. \nShe turns on them both and goes back inside. Before Lee can make a wisecrack Bucky kicks his way through the LAPD papers back to his car... \nINT. LAVERNE'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT \nBucky sits low in his car, watching THE WHITE PACKARD parked near the front of LaVerne's. He's been there awhile... \nFinally the woman from the night before exits and heads for her car. He jumps out and walks quickly to intercept her while she's fumbling for her keys. \nBUCKY Slumming, Miss Sprague? \nShe sighs, exasperated. \nMADELEINE I am now. Daddy spying on me again? \nShe pulls a wad of cash out of her purse. Switching to a very deft imitation of a Scotchman's burr: \nMADELEINE (cont'd) Maddy, girl, ye shouldn't be congregatin' in such unsuitable places-- \nBUCKY I'm a policeman. \nMADELEINE Well that's a new one-- \nShe peels off another bill. Hands it to Bucky. He counts it out. Over a hundred dollars. \nBUCKY Homicide. \nHe hands the money back. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Let's try Elizabeth Short. Linda Martin. \nAll of her bravado drops. Bucky sees it immediately. He grabs her purse and keys and tosses them on the hood of her car. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Here or downtown? I know you knew her so don't jerk me off on that or it's downtown and a whole lot of publicity. \nShe opens the door to her car and slides in. Bucky gets in next to her. By the roof light he can see that her similarity to the Dahlia is more in her clothes and hair, but the resemblance is still there nonetheless. \nMADELEINE (gathering herself) This is all a fluke. I met them at LaVerne's last fall. Betty maybe one time. Linda a couple. She'd come in to cadge a drink or a meal off a sister. \nBUCKY You sleep with either of them? \nMADELEINE No. Just cocktail lounge chitchat. \nBUCKY Are you lez? \nMADELEINE (re the dog) That's Balto. The paper is the LA Times for August 1, 1926. Balto was bringing in the paper when Daddy's accountant told him he'd made his first million. Daddy wanted to consecrate the moment so he shot him. Here we go-- \nINT. A SMALL SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe Sprague family sits in matching easy chairs. No one stands up. \nMADELEINE Bucky Bleichert. May I present my family. My mother, Ramona Cathcart Sprague. My father, Emmett Sprague. My sister, Martha McConville Sprague. \nEmmett Sprague jumps to his feet, pumping Bucky's hand. \nBUCKY A pleasure, Mr. Sprague. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE Saw you fight Mondo Sanchez. Boxed the pants off him. Another Billy Conn you were. \nBUCKY Thanks. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE Mondo gave a good show. What ever happened to him? \nBUCKY Died of a heroin overdose. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE Too bad. Shamed his family. (beat) Speaking of families-- \nBoth Martha and Ramona stand up. Martha is 19, plain and serious, with a tenacious resemblance to Emmett. (Neither of whom look much like Madeleine.) \nRamona, on the other hand, possesses a pushing-fifty resemblance to Madeleine combined with the flaccid face and unfocused features of a booze or drug addict. \nRAMONA (trace of a slur) Madeleine says nice things about you. \nMADELEINE Daddy can we eat? Bucky and I want to catch a nine-thirty show. \nINT. THE DINING ROOOM - LATER \nA black maid serves large portions of corned beef and cabbage. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE Dig in, lad. Hearty fare breeds hearty people. Haute cuisine breeds degenerates. \nBucky smiles politely and begins eating. \nMARTHA I want to draw Mr. Bleichert, Daddy. \nOn Emmett's nod Martha pulls out a small sketch pad. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE You're in for a cruel caricaturing, Bucky. Maddy's my pretty one, but Martha's my certified genius. \nA wince from Martha. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE (cont'd) What kind of name is Bleichert? Dutch? \nBUCKY German. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE A great people, the Germans. Hitler was a bit excessive, but mark my words that someday we'll regret not joining forces with him to fight the Reds. I killed a lot of your countrymen during the war. \nMARTHA Did you meet Balto out in the hallway? \nBUCKY Very realistic. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE An old friend stuffed him. We were in the Scots regiment together. Georgie Tilden. He wanted to work in the flickers. \nBUCKY So when did you come here? \nEMMETT SPRAGUE 1920. Hollywood was a cow pasture, but the silent flickers was booming. Georgie got work as a lighting man, and me building houses. Georgie got me introduced to Mack Sennett and I helped him build that housing project he was putting up--Hollywoodland-- underneath that godawful sign. \nBUCKY I always loved the Keystone Kops. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE Old Mack knew how to squeeze a dollar dry, he did. He had extras moonlighting as laborers and vice versa. I used to drive 'em over to Hollywoodland after twelve hours on a Keystone Cops flicker and put in another six hours by torchlight. Even gave me as assistant director credit a couple times, so grateful he was for the way I squeezed his slaves-- \nA SCREECH interrupts Emmett's monologue. Bucky looks across the table to see Ramona trying to corral a potato with her fork (the source of the sound). \nEMMETT SPRAGUE (cont'd) Mother? Are you feeling well? Would you like to contribute to the conversation? \nRamona forks a small bit of food and chews it daintily. \nRAMONA Did you know, Mr. Bleichert, that Ramona Boulevard was named after me? \nBUCKY No Mrs. Sprague, I didn't. \nRAMONA When Emmett married me for my father's money he promised my family that he would use his influence with the City Zoning Board to have a street named after me. But all he could manage was a dead-end block in a red light district in Lincoln Heights. Are you familiar with the neighborhood, Mr. Bleichert? \nBUCKY I grew up there. \nRAMONA Then you know that the Mexican prostitutes expose themselves out of windows to attract customers. I hear many of them know Mr. Sprague by name-- \nEmmett Sprague SLAMS the table. Plates rattle. Silence. Bucky stares into his lap as Madeleine grabs his knee tightly. \nRAMONA (cont'd) I'll sing for my supper when Mayor Bowron comes to dinner, but not for Madeleine's male whores. A common policeman. My God, Emmett. How little you think of me. \nShe struggles to her feet and leaves the room. Her husband follows. \nMADELEINE I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. \nMARTHA (cheery) Mr. Bleichert? \nMartha tears a piece of paper out of her sketch pad. Bucky takes it as she walks away. \nANGLE ON THE SKETCH: \nA caricature of a naked Bucky having sex with Madeleine. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER \nA cinderblock auto court filled with pre-war jalopies. The camera closes on a dingy door. Room 11. \nINT. THE RED ARROW INN - ROOM 11 - SAME \nA single yellow light illuminates the dreary flop as Bucky and Madeleine fuck on the bed. \nMADELEINE I'm so...sorry. Don't hate my family-- don't--they're not so bad-- \nBucky grabs her hair-- \nBUCKY Not them, me. Do me. Be with me. \nFocusing, Madeleine pins Bucky with her knees and pulls him deep into her until they're no longer common policeman and rich girl slut. They're one. \nINT. THE RED ARROW INN - ROOM 11 - SAME \nThey hold each other, sweaty and spent. \nBUCKY Well. I think you kept your name out of the papers. \nMADELEINE Until we announce the wedding? \nBUCKY Your mother would love that. \nMADELEINE She's a hypocrite. She takes pills the doctor gives her, so she's not a hophead. You know how Daddy really made his money? \nBUCKY How? \nMADELEINE He bought rotten lumber and abandoned movie facades from Mack Sennett and built houses out of them. He's got firetraps all over LA registered to phony corporations...His \"good friend\" George? Disfigured in a car crash while running Daddy some errands. Daddy throws him scraps now--odd jobs tending some rental property-- \nBUCKY You don't have to tell me this-- \nShe looks down again. The cops look at each other. Linda's harder and more desperate than they imagined. \nLINDA MARTIN (cont'd) You'll let me have it back, won't you? You won't let people look at it? \nNow its the cops turn to look away. \nEXT. THE HALLWAY - AFTER \nRuss and Bucky. \nRUSS MILLARD Whattya think? \nBUCKY I think she's covering on the Mex angle. Maybe she knows him and doesn't want him taking a smut rap. Maybe he's white. The TJ stuff is sound, though. I'd detach Meg Caulfield from Wilshire Clerical to play cellmate for a day. \nRUSS MILLARD Bleichert you are a very bright penny today. (beat) Well. Looks like it's blue movie night at City Hall. \nINT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER \nA projector and screen has been set up. All the big-wigs are present: Ellis Loew, Jack Tierney, Thad Green and Chief of Police C.B. Horrall. Millard, Harry and Lee. \nA clerical assistant threads the projector as Bucky settles into a seat next to Lee. On Lee's lap is a newspaper with the headline: \"Boulevard-Citizen's Mastermind to be Released --LA Bound after 8 years of Custody\" \nLEE (raggedy) Gettin' any? \nBucky's about to respond when the lights dim and a blurred image hits the screen. It begins to focus. \nA title: \"Slave Girls From Hell\" \nThe movie: A big high-ceiling room with Egyptian hieroglyphics on the walls. Pillars shaped like coiled serpents are stationed throughout the room; the camera zooms in for a close-up of two inset plaster snakes swallowing each other's tails. The snakes dissolve into Betty Short, wearing only stockings and doing an inept hoochie koochie dance... \nAn audible breath in the muster room. \nA hand reaches into frame, passing Betty a large cylindrical object: a dildo, scales covering the shaft, fangs extending from the circumcised head. Betty puts it in her mouth, sucks it, eyes wide open and glassy. \nAn abrupt cut: Linda Martin, naked, lying on a divan. Betty enters the frame with the dildo; she puts it between Linda's legs, pushing it inside her. Linda rotates her hips, trying her best to fake ecstasy instead of pain and sadness. \nAnother cut: Betty mouthing the words \"No, please\" to the camera. A hand pushing her head down towards Linda's crotch. Betty tonguing next to the dildo... \nBACK ON THE MUSTER ROOM \nThe atmosphere is somber, but calm. The film continues... \nCHIEF HORRALL Whattya think, Russ? This got anything to do with the girl's murder-- \nRUSS MILLARD Long shot, Chief. Harry and I are headed down to TJ tonight. The Mex doesn't play as the killer. But maybe he showed it to someone-- \nSuddenly Lee jumps up, standing in front of the screen. \nLEE Who gives a fuck if he didn't kill her! I've sent Boy Scouts to the green room for less than this! \nHe yanks down the screen with a crash and storms out of the room. The movie continues on the chalked up blackboard. \nINT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER \nLee sits on the ground, head in his hands. Bucky enters and sits on a bench next to him. \nLEE Did you see her face, Bucky? Did you see? \nBUCKY Yeah. I did, partner. I did. \nBucky notices Lee's still clutching the De Witt article in his fist. He pries it loose. \nEllis Loew and Russ Millard enter. \nELLIS LOEW Goddammit, Blanchard! I got you Warrants. You're my man, and you made me look like a fool in front of the two most powerful men in the Department. If you weren't Mr. Fire you'd be suspended from duty already. You've gotten personally involved in the Short case-- \nBUCKY (holding up the newspaper) Mr. Loew, it's not just Betty Short-- \nELLIS LOEW Shut up, Bleichert. (back to Lee) You're back on Warrants as of tomorrow. Report to me at 0800 with letters of apology for Green and Horrall. For the sake of your pension I'd suggest you grovel. \nLEE I want to go to TJ-- \nELLIS LOEW Blanchard! \nPoison hangs in the air. Ellis turns on his heels. \nINT. THE SQUADRON - DAY \nBucky sits in his cubicle searching the Dahlia files. The clock behind him reads \"12:30\". Loew approaches. \nELLIS LOEW You've been skating around all morning, Bleichert. Vogel and Koenig went to Tijuana an hour ago so I need you to check out a radio car and get out there. \nBUCKY Yes, sir. \nELLIS LOEW And if you see that phantom partner of yours, tell him this no-show's gonna cost him three days pay. \nLoew walks off. Bucky dials the phone. \nMADELEINE (VO) Hello. \nBUCKY It's me. You want to get together? \nMADELEINE (VO) When? \nBUCKY I'll pick you up in forty-five minutes. \nMADELEINE (VO) Not at the house. Daddy's having a business soiree. The Red Arrow. \nBUCKY I have an apartment, you know. \nMADELEINE (VO) Room 11. Forty-five minutes. \nShe hangs up. \nINT. RED ARROW MOTEL - ROOM 11 - LATER \nThey lie naked in the bed. Bucky's lost in thought. \nMADELEINE Smile at me. Look soft and sweet. \nHe looks anything but. \nBUCK They picked up Linda Martin yesterday. She had a stag film of her and Betty Short playing lez. Spooky stuff. \nMadeleine sits up. \nMADELEINE Did she mention me? \nBUCKY No. And I checked through the case file. There's no mention of that note-leaving number you pulled. (beat) Babe, I'm withholding evidence for you. It's a fair trade for what I'm getting, but it still shakes me. Is there anything you haven't told me about Betty and Linda? \nShe runs her fingers down his ribcage, teasing his boxing scars. \nMADELEINE Sugar, Betty and I made love once, that one time we met last summer. I just did it to see what it would be like to do it with someone who looked like me and-- \nBUCKY Jesus Christ. \nHe jumps from the bed and pulls on his pants. \nMADELEINE Bucky that's it, I swear. Please stay-- \nHe pulls on his shirt, his handcuffs and his .38. Grabs his jacket-- \nMADELEINE (cont'd) Stay sugar stay-- \nBucky and Fritz Vogel drive past beggars swarming tourists, hookers dispensing front seat blow jobs, zoot suit youths prowling for drunks to roll... \nEXT. THE TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS \nThe two men park the car in the middle of a car-choked street and decide to try walking. They're immediately swallowed up by kid beggars shoving crucifixes in their faces. \nBucky tosses handfuls of coins into the gutters and the children scatter, squabbling over the coins. \nIN THE BACKGROUND \nFritz Vogel approaches a Rurale and talks to him. The Rurale nods yes, gesturing down an alley to a squat cinderblock building. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A FILTHY MEXICAN JAIL - SOON AFTER \nVogel and Bucky walk quickly down a corridor lined with empty cells. A Mexican jailer unlocks the last cell and the two cops walk in to face \nBOBBY DEWITT \nthe hatchet-faced tough of 1939 now a grizzled and bloated well-used piece of work. He stands up, full of con bravado. \nDEWITT Cops, huh? Well at least you're American. Never thought I'l be glad to see you guys. \nVOGEL Why start now? \nVogel kicks in the balls, dropping him to his knees. Vogel smashes him with a thick backhand across the face. \nCUT TO: \nBUCKY HANDCUFFING BOBBY DEWITT TO A CHAIR \nVogel stands over him. \nVOGEL Lee Blanchard's here in TJ, and you came here flush out of Big Q. That's a goddamned strange coincidence and I don't like it. I don't like you and I don't like being down in this rat-infested country when I could be home with my family. \nDeWitt pisses his pants. \nVOGEL (cont'd) Did you know Blanchard was in TJ? \nDEWITT Ain't seen Blanchard since my fuckin' trial. \nVogel smashes him across the face. \nVOGEL Do not use profanity with me, and address me as sir. \nDeWitt's head bobs up and down. \nVOGEL (cont'd) Now Blanchard's scared of you. Why? \nDEWITT Man o Manieschewitz, what a laugh. Lee beauty gotta be scared of me 'cause of how I flapped my trap at trial, but all I know is what I read in the papers. Maybe I was thinkin' revenge, maybe talkin' trash to my cellies, but when Lee beauty killed them niggers-- \nVogel topples DeWitt with a right hook and then picks him back up by the neck, squeezing the life out of him. \nVOGEL Bobby boy I do not like Sergeant Blanchard but he is a fellow officer and I will not have syphilitic scum like you defaming him. Now you risked a parole violation for a trip down here. \nHe lets go of his neck, the color returning to DeWitt's face. \nVOGEL (cont'd) Why are you here, Bobby. You tell me. \nDEWITT (a beaten dog) I came down to cop some heroin and move it back to LA. I'm meeting a guy, Felix Casco, at the Gardena Motel. Please. Don't hurt me no more. Please. \nVogel claps his hands together, gleeful with this bonus bust. \nVOGEL (heading out of the cell) I'm gonna call Ellis. \nBucky turns back to De Witt, who's much more relaxed now that Vogel's left the cell. \nBUCKY Finish up with you and Blanchard. \nDEWITT Sir, all that's between me and Blanchard is that I fucked this cunt Kay Lake-- \nIN SLOW MOTION-- \nBucky leaps on De Witt, grabbing him around the neck and choking him. De Witt turns blue, his eyes bulging out-- \nBEHIND BUCKY, VOICES IN SPANISH \nand then hands on his shoulders as Ducky is hurled backwards into the cell bars. And then \nBLACKNESS \nwhich slowly becomes grey, and then back to normal as Bucky finds himself awakening on the floor of the cell. \nRefocusing on the scene: \nTwo Rurales in jodhpur boots pick their teeth with matchsticks as Fritz Vogel pulls Bucky to his feet. \nBUCKY How long-- \nVOGEL I let Bobby boy go so we could tail him to his pal. But he blew his tail while you were catching up on your beauty sleep, which is too bad for him. \nCUT TO: \nA STUDEBAKER PATROL CAR WITH LIGHTS FLASHING \nINSIDE THE STUDEBAKER \nVogel, Koenig, a Rurale, and Bucky (holding a piece of ice to the back of his head). \nThe car arrives at a horseshoe-shaped auto court. Two Mexican policeman stand guard outside one of its rooms. \nINT. THE MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER \nAs the American cops walk in on a cordite-reeking slaughterhouse. Bobby De Witt and a Mexican man lay dead on the floor, bullet holes oozing blood all over them. \nBucky notes the bruises on De Witt's neck from where he choked him. Bucky squints at the men, still a little disoriented... \nVOGEL The spic's Felix Casco, a known dope trafficker. Maybe it was other dope scum, maybe Lee, maybe it was God. I say let our Mexican colleagues handle their own dirty laundry and we go back to LA and find the son of a bitch who sliced the Dahlia. \nINT. KAY AND LEE'S HOUSE - DAY \nKay sits curled into a corner of the couch, defensively. Bucky sits on a small chair next to Lee's large easy chair. \nKAY I spent the morning with Internal Affairs. I told them...everything I knew. I gave them so much...and in the end it didn't seem like anything at all. \nBUCKY He'll came back, Kay. I'm sure of it. \nKAY You don't know anything, Dwight. But that's what I like about you. \nBUCKY Kay-- \nKAY I've been offered a job. Teaching sixth grade at Fairfax Primary. With Lee gone now-- \nBUCKY He's coming back. \nShe nods, mollifying him. \nCUT TO: \nA NEON SIGN: THE EL NIDO MOTEL \nCLOSE ON: ROOM 204 \nBucky smiles weakly; Russ knows him. \nRUSS MILLARD It's not as much fun once it moves to the back pages, is it? (changing subjects) I hear they arrested two Mexicans in Juarez for the Bobby De Witt murder. \nBUCKY I heard that, too. \nRUSS MILLARD You must be relieved. \nBUCKY They've rescinded the APB on Lee. If he doesn't show up in thirty days he's out. \nRUSS MILLARD He'll be found if he wants to be found. \nBUCKY Like the guy who killed the Dahlia? \nRuss smiles grimly. \nEXT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - EVENING \nBucky rings the doorbell. Fritz Vogel answers. \nVOGEL Boyo! Glad you could make it. \nHe claps Bucky on the shoulder and leads him into the house. \nINT. FRITZ VOGEL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe interior decorating equivalent of highballs and pretzels, which is exactly what Vogel, Bucky and Ellis Loew are consuming. Bucky drinks with the trepidation of the King's food taster. \nELLIS LOEW I called this little meeting for a couple reasons, Bucky. We'd both like to see the Short case closed out and get back to normal business. \nBucky looks impatient and Ellis senses this. \nELLIS LOEW (cont'd) We're both comers, Bucky. Fritzie wants you for his partner when he gets his lieutenancy, and-- \nBUCKY Russ Millard wants me when Harry retires. \nVOGEL You're too raw for him, boyo. Old Russ is a sob sister, and I'm much more your type. \nBucky considers the truth in this. To Loew: \nBUCKY What do you want, Ellis? \nELLIS LOEW Very well, Dwight. I'll tell you. There are four confessors still being held at City Jail. They've got no alibis, weren't coherent when they were first questioned, and they're all violent, frothing-at-the- mouth lunatics. I want them reintegrated. It's a muscle job. \nVOGEL I wanted Bill Koenig-- \nELLIS LOEW But Bill's a bit too enamored with violence. So it's you, Dwight. Yes or no? Because if it's yes, I'll make sure you're back on Warrants tomorrow with an inside track to some stripes. If not, it's Homicide shitwork until Russ Millard gets tired of you. We both know that Russ is a patient, forbearing man, Dwight. That could be a long time. Yes or no? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE CITY JAIL PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nas four manacled men are being loaded into a drunk wagon while Bucky flips through their rap sheets and mug shots. \nINSIDE THE DRUNK WAGON \nthe four men sit in the back as Bucky drives the truck. The camera pans their faces. The first, LOREN BIDWELL, pale, old and palsied. \nVOICE OVER On my way over I played out their rap sheets in my head, trying to work up a head of hate...Loren Bidwell, three time Atascadero loser, falls for aggravated sexual assault on minors. Between prison jolts he confessed to all the big sex crimes. \nEXT. AN OLD WAREHOUSE BUILDING \nBucky pulls the drunk wagon up to a building, its street facade illuminated: \"KOUNTY KING LUNCH MEAT--SERVING L.A. COUNTY WITH INSTITUTIONAL FOOD SINCE 1923\"... \nTHE CAMERA finds the second man, CECIL DURKIN. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) Cecil Durkin--hophead, knife fighter and a jailhouse rape-o who played jazz drums with some good combos. He took two Quentin jolts for Arson and was caught masturbating at the scene of his last torch. \nAT THE FRONT OF THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING \nFritz Vogel opens the door and leads the men inside. \nINT. THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS \nA huge sawdust-covered roam, meathooks dangling from the ceiling. Beef dangles over half the hooks. The four men look terrified. \nThe camera finds the third man, CHARLIE ISSLER: \nVOICE OVER Charlie Issler was a pimp and a career confessor specializing in copping to hooker homicides. His three procuring beefs had netted him a year county jail time, his phony confessions two ninety day observation stints at the Camarillo nut farm. \nAnd the fourth man, PAUL ORCHARD: \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) And finally Paul Orchard. Jack roller, male prostitute, and a former San Bernardino County deputy sheriff. \nThe group reaches a back wall of the warehouse where FOUR UNUSED MEATHOOKS DANGLE OVER FOUR CHAIRS. \nBucky studies the men's apprehensive faces as Vogel stands each one on a chair with their manacled hands hooked over their respective meathooks. \nBucky's gaze drifts back behind a large box where he sees A SHEET-COVERED TABLE sticking out. Before his curiosity draws him over Vogel addresses the prisoners. \nVOGEL You all confessed to killing the Dahlia. We can't prove you did, so you're gonna have to convince us... Query on, Bucko. \nBucky takes a deep breath and heads first to old man Bidwell. The man's palsy has him shaking and Bucky grabs the meathook above him to steady him. \nBUCKY Tell me about Betty Short, pops. Why'd you kill her? \nBidwell looks at him with beseeching eyes. \nVOGEL Don't be timid, boyo. That bird made little boys suck his hog. \nBucky's hand twitches on the meathook. \nBUCKY Come clean, pop. \nBIDWELL I didn't kill her mister. I just wanted a ticket to the honor farm. Three hots and a cot, that's all. Please, mister. \nThe man's weakened state makes his argument for him. Bucky moves on to Cecil Durkin. \nBUCKY Tell me about it, Cecil. \nDURKIN (laughing) You get that line from Dick Tracy or Gangbusters? \nBucky catches Vogel out of the corner of his eye. Measuring... \nBUCKY One more time, shitbird. Tell me about you and Betty Short. \nDURKIN I fucked Betty Short and I fucked your mama! I'm your fucking daddy! \nBucky one-two's him in the solar plexus. His legs buckle, but he keeps his feet on the chair. \nDURKIN (cont'd) You think you clever, don't you. You the bad guy, your buddy the nice guy. Older than vaudeville. \nBUCKY I'm the nice guy, Cecil. Keep that in mind. \nThis shuts Durkin up. Bucky moves to Charlie Issler. \nISSLER (sincere) Please. I didn't kill Liz. I don't know why I do these things, and I apologize. So please don't let that man hurt me. \nBUCKY Convince me. \nISSLER I...can't. I just can't. \nBUCKY You're a pimp. You know Betty Short? \nBUCKY Issler did. \nRUSS MILLARD The pimp? I thought he said he'd never heard of her. \nBUCKY You know what else he said? \nA FLASHBACK - THE WAREHOUSE \nAs Vogel cracks Issler's ribs. \nVOGEL What did you know about the Dahlia's missing days? \nISSLER I knew you at Ad Vice-- \nINT. THE POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nHarry Sears cradles the phone in his ear as he flips through a large metal file cabinet. Behind him the glass door reads in reverse: \"ADMINISTRATIVE VICE'. \nHARRY SEARS (INTO PHONE) N-n-no, Russ. No file on Issler. Gone. \nBACK AT THE EL NIDO - SAME \nBucky and Russ sit in silence, thinking. They know they're onto something... \nBUCKY Fritzie didn't give a damn about those other three. It was all about Issler. Never occurred to me before. \nBucky gets to his feet. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Meet me back here. Late. \nRUSS MILLARD Bright penny-- \nBut Bucky's already out the door. \nEXT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nBucky stakes out the dark house. \nEXT. VOGEL'S SERVICE PORCH - LATER \nBucky slips an oil dipstick into the narrow crack of the back door and flips the simple hook and eyehole lock. He slides into the house... \nINT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nas Bucky creeps through the house until he gets to a closed door. He opens it, entering \nFRITZIE'S STUDY \nHe stumbles along the wall until he finds a standing gooseneck lamp and turns it on. The walls are covered with pictures of Fritzie in uniform, dating back twenty-five years. \nBucky bends down in front of the small mahogany desk and begins rifling through its file drawers. What he finds surprises him: \n--carbons of official LAPD intelligence reports, lists of account balances, financial dealings, payments made--all cross-referenced to each individual being investigated. \nA veritable how-to primer on how to extort from criminals.. \nBucky digs deeper into the files and pulls out: \nISSLER'S AD VICE FILE complete with mug shots. \nBUCKY Hello, Charlie. Get lost? \nBucky scans the file, running his finger down the list of names, looking for something familiar. He stops at one: \"SALLY STINSON\". Beside her name a handwritten note: \"Biltmore Hotel\". \nHe writes it down and moves to another list of names: \"Known Associates, no Prostitution Record\". \nAnd there it is: \"Betty Short\". \nINT. BUCKY'S CAR - LATER \nBucky bops to jazz on his radio, pumped with adrenaline. \nINT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT \nBucky tears through a file as Russ watches. \nRUSS MILLARD So good ol' Fritzie's shaking down crooks, maybe sellin' 'em tip-offs before a roust. \nBUCKY I want him nailed. \nRUSS MILLARD Easy, penny. They'd have to testify against him first. And that's not likely after he burns those carbons. But this Issler business--why hide the Issler- Betty connection? \nBUCKY (finding a file) Maybe Charlie pimped her out...to somebody Fritzie doesn't want us to know about... \nA FLASHBACK - THE WAREHOUSE \nas Fritz beats on Charlie-- \nFRITZIE Tell me what you know about the Dahlia's missing days-- \nBACK TO THE EL NIDO \nBucky reads through a letter. \nBUCKY I knew it. Here. Betty writes to one of her phantom servicemen boyfriends: (reading aloud) \"...had drinks with a great girl, Sally Stinson, who thinks she way be able to help me get a job cocktailing...\" \nRUSS MILLARD Cocktailing. \nBUCKY Yeah, I know. That's what made it stick with me...What next, padre? \nRUSS MILLARD You sit tight. Go hack to swingwatch. Me and Harry'll poke around. \nBUCKY (displeased) I want him. \nRUSS MILLARD You'll get him, too. But you've got to cool your temper. It's all patience with the big fish or they wriggle off. \nINT. KAY'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nBucky lies awake while Kay sleeps. \nVOICE OVER What kept me up that night wasn't the idea of Fritz Vogel extorting criminals, or Fritz Vogel bracing Charlie the pimp to see if Betty had told him something about one of her johns...maybe even Vogel, himself...No... \nA FLASHBACK - FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE \nEllis Loew, Fritz Vogel and Bucky drink cocktails and eat pretzels... \nVOICE OVER ...what kept me up was this thought: if Issler blabbed about Liz and her tricks I would have overheard. Fritz was confident he could keep me quiet. \nEllis and Fritz clink glasses...Smile at Bucky. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) And that was an underestimation I would bleed him for. \nBACK IN KAY'S BED \nHer hand brushes against his cheek. He reaches for it. \nOVER THIS SCENE WE HEAR A PHONE RING AND THE FOLLOWING EXCHANGE. \nBUCKY (VO) Hello? \nRUSS MILLARD We've found her. Meet me at 1546 North Havenhurst in half an hour. \nINT. THE POLICE STATION - SAME \nRUSS MILLARD Yes. Fritzie. He wanted you to lose your cherry. He bought you a woman for two days. Is that right? \nJOHNNY Not a woman. Not a real one. A hoooer. \nJohnny turns the syllable into a long laugh. \nRUSS MILLARD This was at the Biltmore? \nJOHNNY Daddy got a good rate on the room. He knew the house dick...This ain't right... \nRUSS MILLARD We'll be done soon, Johnny. You met Liz Short at the Biltmore, too? \nJOHNNY What's her name introduced me...the hooer. \nRUSS MILLARD And what did you and Liz do? \nJOHNNY We...played horse and rider. Gave her the Big Schnitz. \nRUSS MILLARD Did you whip her? \nJohnny thinks back, his head lolling to and fro... \nJOHNNY Softly. So so softly. Horse and Rider. \nRUSS MILLARD Johnny. Did you kill Liz Short? \nJohnny jerks back spasmodically. \nJOHNNY No no no no! I didn't kill her! \nRUSS MILLARD Easy son-- \nJOHNNY I didn't slice her! \nRUSS MILLARD It's all right...Do you know who did? JOHNNY No! No! \nJohnny's starting to sweat. Russ and Bucky lean in... \nRUSS MILLARD When your Daddy found out you'd been with her, he tried to fix things didn't he? \nJohnny nods yes. \nRUSS MILLARD (cont'd) He found out Charlie Issler had been picked up and he knew Charlie had this confessing problem, right? \nJOHNNY Daddy...went to Ellis...to the Jewboy. Wanted to get Charlie released...but the Jewboy said no...Daddy had a morgue friend owed him a favor and got this DOA cooze...Daddy wanted Uncle Bill but Ellis Jewboy said take Bleichert. (looking right at Bucky) Daddy said you'd do it cuz without Blanchard you were jelly. Said you were a sob sister, weak sister... \nJohnny starts laughing hysterically, shaking his chained hands like a zoo animal trying to get loose. Russ steps in front of a red-hot Bucky-- \nRUSS MILLARD (to Bucky) I think you should go outside. \nEXT. THE FIRE ESCAPE - LATER \nBucky sits out on the fire escape watching cars drive by. Russ leans out the window and hands Bucky the statement. \nRUSS MILLARD His statement. Signed. \nBucky reads it and slips it into his pocket. \nRUSS MILLARD We should sit on this for a little bit. Until I can talk to a legal officer. \nBucky shakes his head no, climbs back inside the window. \nINT. THE HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nBucky handcuffs Johnny's hands behind his back as the big man cries... \nJOHNNY Daddy... \nRUSS MILLARD (to Bucky) It's the shithouse until you retire, you know that. \nBUCKY I owe her this one. \nHe squeezes Johnny's handcuffs tighter. \nINT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - BOOKING - NIGHT \nReporters follow Bucky and Johnny inside, piqued by the sight of a plainclothes officer escorting a cuffed uniform inside. \nBUCKY No comment...No comment... (whispering in Johnny's ear) Tell your Daddy I know everything. Including his extortion deal. Tell him I'm goin' to the papers tomorrow. \nHe approaches the desk sergeant. \nDESK SERGEANT What the hell is this? \nA flashbulb goes off in their faces. Johnny sobs. \nBUCKY I'm Officer Dwight Bleichert and this is Officer John Vogel. \nHe hands over Johnny's signed statement. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Book him. \nAnother flashbulb. \nEXT. CENTRAL STATION - LATER \nBucky jogs up the steps inside. \nINT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER \nHe dresses in his blue uniform, preparing to go back to work. \nINTERCOM Officer Bleichert, go to the watch commander's office immediately. \nBucky brushes imaginary dust off his shirt and grabs his hat. \nINT. LIEUTENANT JASTROW'S OFFICE - SOON AFTER \nBucky walks in, saluting like an idealistic rookie. Jastrow stands, ignoring the salute. \nJASTROW You're on two weeks vacation leave as of now. When you return to duty, report to Chief Green. He'll reassign you to another division. \nBUCKY Why? \nJASTROW Fritz Vogel just blew his brains out. That's why. \nAll Bucky can think to do is salute again, rock firm. He walks outside and crosses into \nINT. THE MUSTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCrammed with blues awaiting roll call. They all stare at Bucky; he meets the eyes that seek his, making them look down. Defiant. \nAs he passes he can hear the hisses: \"Traitor\". \"Bolshevik\". He continues towards the door, almost out when suddenly he hears applause. \nBucky turns to see,Russ Millard, Harry Sears and Thad Green clapping good-bye... \nINT. THE CASTING OFFICE - DAY \nClapstick: \"Elizabeth Short Screen Test #4\" \nShe sits on an ugly brown sofa, sides in her hands. Silence. \nMAN #4 (O.S.) Are you all right, Miss Short? \nKAY Floorboard's loose near the closet. Think you could fix it? \nBUCKY (relieved) Sure, babe. \nThe phone rings. Bucky answers it. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Hello...Hey Vic... \nBucky writes something on a piece of paper. Hangs up. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Gotta go. Work-up on a probable gunshot suicide. \nKAY Sounds lovely. Where is it? \nBUCKY Hancock Park. \nEXT. A COLONIAL MANSION - JUNE STREET - MORNING \nBucky rings the bell. He's dressed plainclothes and carries a technician's canvas bag. \nAn attractive woman in her early fifties opens the door. \nWOMAN Yes? \nBUCKY I'm Officer Bleichert. LAPD. My I express my condolences, Mrs.-- \nWOMAN Jane Chambers. Condolences accepted. You're the lab man? \nHe nods yes. She lets him in and he follows. \nJANE CHAMBERS It's the study in back of the dining room. You'll see the police rope. If you'll excuse me, I'll be in my garden. \nHe notices for the first time she's dressed for gardening. \nINT. THE STUDY - MORNING \nBucky steps over the police rope and into the study. A large desk chair lies overturned an the ground next to A TAPE OUTLINE OF A BODY. Three feet away lies A SHOTGUN. \nBehind the chair the brown spattering of blood and brains decorates the white wall and crown mouldings. \nCUT TO: \nA SERIES OF SHOTS \nas Bucky measures the splatter marks on the walls, scrapes tissue from the muzzle of the gun, dusts it for latent prints, etc. At the end he wraps the gun in a plastic bag. \nINT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nas Bucky steps over the police rope and walks back towards the main foyer. He stops short. \nON THE OPPOSING WALL \nhangs a disturbing PAINTING: the portrait of a clown, a young boy done up in court jester's garb. His body is gnarled and hunched. He wears a stuporous ear-to-ear smile that looks like one continuous deep scar. \nIt is eerily reminiscent of Elizabeth Short's death wound. \nSpooked, Bucky pulls his eyes away and settles them on nearby family photos--two young women linked arm in arm. \nJANE CHAMBERS The other survivors. Pretty aren't they? \nShe arrives next to him, dusty with soil. \nBUCKY Like their mother. How old are they? \nJANE CHAMBERS Twenty-one and twenty-three. Are you finished in the study? \nBUCKY Yes. Tell whoever cleans it up to use pure ammonia... (looking at the two girls) Mrs. Chambers-- \nJANE CHAMBERS Jane. \nBUCKY Jane, do you know Madeleine and Martha Sprague? The next block over? \nJANE CHAMBERS (snorts) Those girls and that family. How do you know them? \nBUCKY I did a little work for them once. \nJANE CHAMBERS Consider it lucky if it was a brief encounter. \nBUCKY How do you mean? \nThe hallway phone rings. Jane moves to answer it. \nJANE CHAMBERS Back to condolences. Thank you for being so nice, Mr.-- \nBUCKY Bucky. Good-bye, Jane. \nJANE CHAMBERS Good-bye. \nINT. THE CRIME LAB - LATER \nBucky writes up a report. VIC pokes his head in. \nVIC You finish working up the suicide, Bucky? \nBUCKY Yeah. Pretty routine. Whattya know about the husband? \nVIC Eldridge Chambers? Widow said he was depressed, failing health. The terrible burden of all that money'll get you every time. \nBUCKY Wonder how he made it? \nVIC No mystery there. Real estate. \nBUCKY Oh really? \nINT. THE GARAGE - EVENING \nThe garage door is open to the evening air. Bucky's heavy bag and speed bag hang on hooks. Bucky leans against a stool, a large box open on the work bench. \nINSIDE THE BOX \nBucky brushes aside a clutter of junk and pulls out A PHOTO ALBUM. He opens it and begins flipping through: articles and photos concerning Elizabeth Short. MOSTLY PHOTOS. \nIt's like a man in a mid-life crisis fantasizing about his high school sweetheart. \nOFF ONE OF THE PHOTOS WE DISSOLVE TO: \nANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION \n\"Elizabeth Short...Screen Test #5\" \nShe rambles on, almost oblivious of the camera. \nELIZABETH SHORT ...I had a fiance, Captain Matt Durand. He was in a tank battalion. A Commander. He had...the fiercest blue eyes. Like the deep water you see from a fishing boat... \nShe's lost in thought...we're not sure whether this is a scene, her real life, or just a sad lie... \nTHE NOISE OF A CAR APPROACHING \nBACK TO SCENE \nBucky drops the album back in the box as Kay's car pulls into the driveway. He covers it back up. \nKAY (getting out) What're you doing? \nJANE CHAMBERS (cont'd) Sorry. \nBUCKY So how well do you know the Spragues? \nJANE CHAMBERS Eldridge and Emmett went way back. They served on the California real estate board together. But Emmett was a bit of a crook. My husband got him kicked off the board for building dangerous buildings under phony corporations. \nBUCKY Your husband sounds like a good man. \nJANE CHAMBERS He had his moments. Most of it was out of guilt. He owned slum blocks in San Pedro. When he learned he had cancer, he really started feeling guilty. He voted Democratic last year. Even went in and had meetings with the City Council. I'm sure he gave them dirt on Emmett. \nBUCKY I read an article in the paper. \nJANE CHAMBERS Same day Eldridge killed himself. Apropos, I guess. \nBUCKY Maybe your husband-- \nJANE CHAMBERS My husband was rich and did a mean Charleston. I loved him until I found out he was cheating on me. Now I'm starting to love him again. How strange. \nBUCKY It's not so strange. \nThey watch each other, enjoying each other's company. A strange emotional peace. \nJANE CHAMBERS You're very accepting of other people's frailties. You're young. You should have illusions. \nBUCKY I'm a cop. Illusions aren't standard issue. \nJANE CHAMBERS So how'd a cop get mixed up with Madeleine Sprague? It was Madeleine, I assume? \nBucky's gut clenches. \nBUCKY I stopped her at a red light. One thing led to another. Why do you assume it was Madeleine? \nJANE CHAMBERS Don't play dumb, Bucky. The girl's a roundheels. Always has been. \nBUCKY Jane. Don't be catty. \nJANE CHAMBERS I'm sorry. She can't help it I'm sure. She probably inherited it from her mother. \nBefore Bucky can press Jane stands up with the tray of iced tea. The visit is over. \nJANE CHAMBERS You figure out the rest, officer. \nHe follows her back inside. \nINT. THE HALLWAY - SAME \nAs they stop momentarily in front of the scary clown painting. \nBUCKY God that is spooky. \nJANE CHAMBERS Valuable, too. Eldridge bought it for my birthday a couple years ago. I hate it. Want to take it with you? \nBUCKY No thanks. \nJANE CHAMBERS Thank you, then. You were my best condoler. \nBUCKY And you mine. \nJane gives Bucky a warm handshake. \nEXT. THE STREET - HANCOCK PARK - SOON AFTER \nBucky pulls out of June Street, and passes Muirfield. He slows for a moment, squinting down the street, trying to discern the Sprague mansion. He drives on. \nWe hang on the sign for Muirfield Avenue as the day turns to night... \nAnd down Muirfield Road, we see Bucky's car parked in the shadows. Watching the Sprague house. A voyeur. \nINT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nBucky sleeps soundly as Kay readies herself for work. She watches him for a moment, considering whether to wake him. She decides not to and leaves. \nThe minute she goes, Bucky opens his eyes... \nEXT. MUIRFIELD ROAD - HANCOCK PARK - EVENING \nBucky spies on the Spragues. He digs back into his seat as Madeleine comes down the walk and puts mail in the mail box. Just for a second it looks like she sees him...maybe not... \nINT. CRIME LAB - DAY \nBucky dozes, his tie almost catching on fire in a Bunsen burner. \nEXT. THE MUIRFIELD ROAD STAKEOUT - EVENING \nBucky leans against the window, propping himself up. \nACROSS THE STREET \nMadeleine's Packard pulls out and roars up the street. Bucky guns his car to follow... \nEXT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT \nBucky follows the Packard into a crowded GI bar parking lot. He parks a distance away. But as he watches Madeleine get out of her car he is staggered: \nIt's ELIZABETH SHORT. \nOr, more accurately, it's Madeleine dressed up exactly like the Dahlia in one of her famous portrait photos. Slinky black dress, upswept hair, down to the yellow barrette. She strides into the bar... \nINT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT \nBucky ducks into a smoke-filled GI bar where a commotion is already taking place. \nMadeleine is surrounded by soldiers fawning all over her. Other men simply point and whisper--her Dahlia act isn't lost on anybody. Bucky slides into a booth in the corner to watch. He signals for a drink. \nINT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nFour bourbons later. Bucky watches as Madeleine settles into a more intimate conversation with one soldier. Bucky downs his drink as Madeleine grabs the GI's elbow and escorts him out of the bar. \nEXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER \nBucky sits in his car in the parking lot watching the soldier loiter outside of A motel room. Madeleine returns from the office with the key and lets the two of them in. \nHe watches as the light goes on; and then off. \nINT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - LATER \nBucky comes into the bedroom to find Kay waiting up for him. \nKAY Dwight-- \nHe moves to her, pulling off his clothes as quickly as he can. \nKAY (cont'd) Dwight-- \nHe's on top of her, his bourbon stained kisses go and down her neck and her breasts. \nShe responds, but not quickly enough for him. He rushes into her before she's ready. Still, she tries to be there for him, hoping to catch up with his lust. \nShe doesn't. And they both know it. They embrace, trying to cover up the hollow awkwardness with familiar affection. \nIt doesn't work... \nINT. THAD GREEN'S OFFICE - DAY \nHe reaches for her and she backs out of grabbing range. \nKAY Whoremonger. Coward. Necrophile. \nShe spins out of his grasp and makes for her car. She guns the engine and disappears. \nINT. THE HOUSE - SECONDS LATER \nBucky stands in the middle of the living room, cataloguing the little things. No periodicals on the coffee table, half the record collection gone, no candlesticks. \nHe picks up the largest chair (Lee's favorite) and throws it at the wall. Next, Kay's rocking chair shatters the glass cabinets. The coffee table goes through the front window. \nIN THE BEDROOM \nBucky yanks out all the drawers, turns over the bed. \nIN THE BATHROOM \nhe takes a pipe wrench to the sink, crushes the mirror with one blow... \nIn a terrible ten rounder with the ghosts of his past Bucky demolishes the dream house, pulls his uniforms out of the closet and bolts out of the house, leaving the door open so scavengers can pick the place clean... \nINT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT \nBucky sits on the bed, his back pushed up against the wall. Eyeball to eyeball with Elizabeth Short, Betty, Liz, the Black Dahlia. \nA collage of photos and file folders... \nVOICE OVER It came on then, big and ugly: bye-bye Bleichert at the bus stop, adios shitbird, has-been, never-was, stool pigeon harness bull. \nEXT. THE SLUMS - LATE NIGHT \nBucky stands in the worst of slums, his blue uniform a beacon to anyone who would do him harm. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) You traded a good woman for skunk pussy, you've turned everything that's been handed you to pure, undiluted shit, your \"I will's\" amount to the eighth round at the Academy gym when you stepped into a Blanchard right hand--pratfalling into clover that you turned into horse dung. \nANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION \nNo clapsticks this time. Just Betty Short sitting an the couch. She reaches down and pulls off her pumps. Now she reaches under her dress and begins unrolling her stockings. Not sexy. Empty and resigned. \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) Bye-bye Betty, Beth, Betsy, Liz, we were a couple of tramps, too bad we didn't meet before 39th and Norton, it just might have worked. Maybe us would've been the one thing we wouldn't have fucked up past redemption... \nEXT. 39TH AND NORTON - NIGHT - LATER \nAn apartment complex has been erected at the murder site. \nEXT. AN AERIAL VIEW OF LOS ANGELES - DAY \nANGLE ON: THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN. As we watch the sign changes, the \"D\" dropping off the end. It now reads \"HOLLYWOODLAN\". \nEXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DAY \nBucky, unshaven and out of uniform, leans against his car on a working class residential street. He stares across at a modest Victorian house and the garage behind it. We recognize it hopefully; we've been here before. \nEXT. A GARAGE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nIt's Cleo Short's apartment. Or at least it used to be. Bucky peers in a window and sees it's filled with junk. \nHe walks back towards the street, intent on heading back to his car. on a hunch, he walks up onto the porch of the Victorian house and rings the bell. \nEXT. THE PORCH - SAME \nFootsteps at the door. It opens to reveal another identical twin to Elizabeth Short. \nBucky is stunned and can't find his tongue. \nGIRL (Boston accent) Can I help you? (no response). Great. Take a hike you big sicko-- \nBUCKY Wait-- \nShe begins to shut the door but someone behind her pulls it back open. \nCleo Short, Elizabeth's father. \nCLEO SHORT It's all right, dear. I know this pug. \nINT. THE SITTING ROOM - LATER \nThe two men arrange themselves in chairs while the Betty look- a-alike makes herself busy in the kitchen behind Cleo. \nBucky tries not to stare. He forces himself to focus on Cleo, who, while five years older, looks much better than last time Bucky saw him. \nCLEO SHORT Came into a little change a while back, managed to trade in that shit shack out back for these digs. (beat) And I don't give a fuck what you think, you and your partner ain't much to look at now. I read the papers. \nBucky can't deny that. \nThe young woman brings in two beers for Bucky and Cleo. Bucky checks her out again. Cleo knows why. \nCLEO SHORT (cont'd) My youngest, Christine. \nHe squeezes her hand affectionately. \nCLEO SHORT (cont'd) Best housekeeper of the bunch. Can't cook a damn, though. Got her sister's star-eyes for the pictures, damn straight. Thinks she's gonna be another goddamn Jayne Mansfield. Get out of here, Chrissie... \nShe rolls her eyes, picks up a newspaper and heads out on the porch. \nCLEO SHORT (cont'd) Used to be dozens'd stop by, you know. Drive up from Dago or San Berdoo just to snap a shot of the goddamn garage back there. Thought maybe they'd find one of Betty's dresses in the garbage. Jackals. \nBUCKY You didn't move far. \nCLEO SHORT Wouldn't a mattered if I did. (beat) Whatcha here for, mug? I know you ain't smart enough to solve the case, and you ain't dumb enough to still think I did it...I had an alibi. \nBUCKY Tighter'n a popcorn fart. \nCLEO SHORT And that's air tight, mug. Air tight. \nBucky takes a swig of his beer. Cleo's eyes scour Bucky. \nCLEO SHORT (cont'd) You're hooked on her still, ain't ya? Ha. That's a plug nickel you can't spend, ain't it, mug? Ha. Yea. Betty'll do that to a fella. Especially someone like you. (off Bucky's look) Like I said, I know you mug. \nBUCKY I just thought...Maybe after all this time...There's something you might have forgot...Anything she might have said... \nCleo studies him, knows Bucky's a lost soul. He softens for the first time. Leans forward, elbows on knees. Almost looking like a father who'd lost a daughter. \nCLEO SHORT She was a terrible actress. I'm sure folks've told you that. She'd practice in front of the john mirror. Once or twice she got me in on it...Reading parts with her for some audition. She stunk. Even a parent could tell. What Beth was good at was writing. All her teachers used to say that. Not that a grease like me'd know the difference. Maybe she coulda written for the pictures. But she wanted to be an actress like every other silly girl. \nHis gaze drifts outside to his youngest daughter. \nCLEO SHORT (cont'd) Your folks still alive? \nBUCKY My father. \nCLEO SHORT (poking) He proud of his son, the ace copper? Or maybe he thought you'd end up champ? \nBucky shrugs off any talk of his father. Cleo gets it. \nCLEO SHORT Your momma? \nBUCKY She killed herself a long time ago. \nCleo takes a swig of his beer. \nCLEO SHORT Probably better off then. \nINT. THE BUNGALOW - SAME \nA scattering of trash in the front room, animal shit, a bicycle tire, rags. \nThey move through the house, each roam, each closet and corner creeps with potential violence. Still, nothing. \nFrom the kitchen: \nRUSS MILLARD Bucky. \nBucky joins Russ at the back door, the screen rotted off. Through the empty window they see: \nAN ALUMINUM GARDENING SHED, the door wide open. \nYou know it before they even get there. But as soon as they step inside... \nINT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS \nThey know something bad happened here... \nHalf the room is taken up by a mattress, its blue ticking stained dark brown with blood. A gas lantern sits in the corner, leaning against a stack of blood-spattered books, including a copy of Gray's Anatomy and Victor Hugo's The Man Who Laughs along with a clutch of pornographic pictures. \nRUSS MILLARD God help her. \nBucky's already pulling on a pair of rubber gloves from his SID days. For the first time we notice he's carrying his forensic kit. \nHe opens it, revealing the test tubes, fingerprint powder, tweezers, etc. \nBUCKY (throwing Russ gloves) Box up the books and papers. Maybe light that lantern. \nRuss grants Bucky his take-charge attitude. He snaps on a pair of gloves. \nA GRUESOME MONTAGE \n1. Bucky scrapes blood off a wall and into a test tube. \n2. Russ flips through the pornographic material--some of it very intense. \n3. Bucky fills up another test tube with dark hair tweezed from the caked blood on the mattress. \n4. Underneath the mattress, Bucky finds small pieces of rope... \n5. Bucky measures a bloody sole print and traces it onto a piece of paper. \n6. Bucky finger prints the whole fucking place, pulling good prints from the door jamb, the door, and the wall near the head of the mattress. \nOUTSIDE THE GARDENING SHED \nRuss fiddles with the books, making himself busy. Finally he walks back inside. \nINT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS \nBucky sits on the floor, his hands shaking as he holds a fingerprint plate in one hand and a piece of paper in the other. \nRUSS MILLARD You all right? \nBucky hands him the fresh plate. Russ studies it. Bucky hands him the piece of paper with a blown-up set of prints on it. The two sets of prints are identical. Russ sees the name at the top of the paper: ELIZABETH SHORT. \nHe exhales deeply. \nBUCKY Thing is, Russ. Thing is...There's another set of latents up there on the doorjamb...And my hands're shaking so bad I can't transfer 'em. \nCUT TO: \nRUSS MILLARD HACKING A FOUR INCH SECTION OF THE DOOR JAMB OFF WITH HIS KNIFE AND SLIPPING IT INTO A PLASTIC BAG. \nBucky sits on the ground outside. \nEXT. UNDERNEATH THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN - LATER \nThe last of the \"LAND\" letters has come down and a party has ensued. A marching band plays \"There's No Business Like Show Business\". \nBucky and Russ stumble out of the woods, carrying the evidence of Betty Short's death in their hands. \nINT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT \nBucky sits on the bed, the evidence spread out around him. Russ stands in the doorway. \nBUCKY We finally have it, Russ. All of it. All of her. (gesturing around the room) All right here. \nRUSS MILLARD Are you sure you don't want to came home? Mrs. Millard'll fix up the couch. \nBUCKY No. Thanks. I'll stay here. (re the doorjamb piece) I want to get up early and confirm these prints. \nRuss nods. \nRUSS MILLARD You're a very very bright penny, Officer. \nHe closes the door, leaving Bucky alone with Elizabeth. \nINT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT \nBucky lies on the bed, staring at the ceiling. \nBUCKY (cont'd) That night I pictured myself the way I wanted Elizabeth to picture me--her knight in shining armor, a reborn two-bit harness bull who cracked the biggest unsolved homicide in California history. A war hero, a heavyweight champion. \nINT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - DAWN \nBucky flips through Gray's Anatomy, killing time. \nBUCKY (cont'd) I stayed with her that night and dreamed of all the bullshit that would never happen. Not if I wanted to keep my job at all. Because there was no way for me to make the arrest without admitting that I'd suppressed evidence years ago. The case would always be open. And so while it killed me to wait 'til morning, in some ways...this was our last night together. \nINT. THE CRIME LAB - MORNING \nBucky transfers the killer's prints from the doorjamb to a plate. \nINT. A LARGE ROOM WITH FILE CABINETS \nBucky pulls a fingerprint card from a cabinet. He shuts the cabinet. The tab on the outside reads: \"City Employees\". \nEXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - MORNING \nBucky edges his way along the side of the house. A side window is open and he pulls himself inside. \nINT. THE MANSION - CONTINUOUS \nMoving boxes fill the front hallway. Bucky hears voices coming from the main hall. Madeleine and Emmett. \nBucky unholsters his gun; from his pocket he pulls out a SILENCER and screws it on the muzzle. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE (O.S.) ...besides, one of my foremen said the goddamn pipes are spewing gas...There'll be hell to pay. It's about time I showed the three of you good ol' Scotland. \nMADELEINE I don't wanna go to Europe, Daddy. You're always talking about how dreadful and provincial it is. \nEMMETT SPRAGUE ...they've got what you need, lassie. \nBucky steps into the main room, gun prominent at his side. \nBUCKY And what is that, Emmett? Saps like me? Direct line to the straight dope? Or is that what you needed? \nEMMETT SPRAGUE Aaah, laddie. \nHe eyes the gun. \n", "test1_input": "BUCKY Nash is renting a room in that building over there. \nRUSS MILLARD Blood on the premises? \nBUCKY No. This isn't him. \nRUSS MILLARD The lab'll be the judge of that. \nMillard and Bucky look dawn the street to see cars swinging onto Norton, beelining for the commotion. Reporters and photographers begin pouring out of their cars, quickly coming up against a line of cops keeping them from the body. \nBucky makes his way over to Lee, unable to stop staring at the body. \nBUCKY Hey. Junior Nash, remember? \nLEE He didn't do this. \nBUCKY No. He beat an old woman to death. That's why he's our priority warrantee. \nLEE Not anymore. \nBUCKY This ain't ours, partner-- \nLEE (on edge) It is now, partner. \nEXT. THE CRIME SCENE - LATER \nToo sheet-covered stretchers are shoved into the coroner's wagon. The doors slam shut and the car pulls away. \nCUT TO: \nRUSS MILLARD DIVIDING A STREET ATLAS INTO FOOTBEATS \nas fifteen officers (including Lee and Bucky) wait for their assignment. \nA MONTAGE OF QUESTIONING \nCops ring doorbells throughout Leimert Park: \nOFFICER (to an old woman) Have you heard female screams... \nBUCKY (to an off-duty serviceman) ...anyone discarding women's clothing? \nLEE (to a little kid) ...seen anyone in the lot on 39th... \nBUCKY (to a housewife) ...and what about this man? (holds out a photo of Junior Nash) \nTo all of these questions a big fat \"no\". \nINT. THE OLYMPIC BOXING ARENA - NIGHHT \nBucky watches two Mexican bantamweights beat each other bloody. An EMPTY SEAT next to him. Irritated, he gets up and leaves. \nENT. 39TH AND NORTON - NIGHT - LATER \nBucky gets out of his car and finds Lee standing inside the crime scene rope watching lab techs poke around in the weeds. The entire area is lit up by arclights, illuminating the two quicklime outlines of the body parts. \nBUCKY You were supposed to meet me at the fights tonight, remember? \nLEE Priority. Remember. \nBUCKY Priority for the Bureau. Not for us. \nLEE Nice white girl gets snuffed. Gotta show the voters they did the right thing passing the bond issue. It's a showcase. It's A-plus, Buck. We don't miss this. \nBUCKY We've had enough headlines for the week. \nLee points to the body outline. His hand shakes a bit and maybe for the first time we sense he's wired on something. \nLEE With or without you, partner. \nBucky shakes his head and begins walking away. \nLEE (cont'd) With or without you. \nBUCKY I heard you. \nINT. THE SQUAD ROOM - NEXT DAY \nBucky enters a mob scene. One cop holds up a front page headline: \"Hunt Werewolf's Den in Torture Slaying\" \nAlong a bench, five derelict-looking men are manacled to a bench. A cop walks by, notes Bucky's confusion: \nOFFICER Confessors. \nJust then the interrogation room door opens and Bill Koenig leads a doubled-over fat man out of the door. \nKOENIG He didn't do it. \nA couple officers clap satirically at their desks. \nBUCKY (to another cop) Blanchard? \nOFFICER In with Loew.(beat) And reporters. \nOff Bucky's concerned look we \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING \nBucky walks in to see Loew holding a press conference, Lee dressed in a suit and sitting at his side. \nELLIS LOEW ...and the heinous nature of this killing makes it imperative to catch this fiend as soon as possible. A number of specially trained officers, including Mr. Fire and his partner Mr. Ice... \nON BUCKY'S FACE \nDisbelief. Disgust. \nBACK IN THE WARRANTS CUBICLE - LATER \nLee catches up with a pissed off Bucky. \nBUCKY You got us detached? \nLEE Slow and easy, Bucky. First I gave Loew a memo saying Nash blew our jurisdiction-- \nBUCKY You did what? \nLEE It's all right. The APB still stands. We've got the pad staked. He's covered. \nBucky's face says he's not sold on Lee's reasoning. \nLEE (cont'd) One week. Just one week. After that, it's back to Junior. I promise. \nBucky studies Lee's resolve; he relents. \nLEE (cont'd) Copacetic. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PATHOLOGY ROOM - LATER \nAntiseptic white with metallic slab tables. Two objects covered in sheets lay on the table. \n", "test1_true": "LEE Jesus, Bucky. \nCORONER On gross pathology, we have a female Caucasian between sixteen and thirty. Cadaver is presented in two halves with bisection level with the umbilicus. \nThe nun scribbles furiously to keep up. The officers are torn between staring at their shoes and at the body. \nCORONER (cont'd) ...Through-and through laceration from both mouth corners...no visible signs of neck bruises...massive depressed skull fractures...Inspection of upper half abdominal cavity reveals no free-flowing blood. Intestines, stomach, liver and spleen removed. \nThe doctor stops to allow the nun time to catch up. Russ Millard clears his throat. \nRUSS MILLARD Is it...all right to smoke, doctor? \nCORONER She's not going to mind. \nBoth Russ and Harry light up. \nCORONER (cont'd) Lower half of the cadaver reveals removal of reproductive organs...Both legs broken at the knee, and healing, light lash marks on the upper back and shoulders... \nThe door opens and a police officer enters, handing a sheet of paper to Millard and speaking to him briefly. Millard reads the sheet and hands it to Harry, who then hands it to Lee. \nLEE (reading) Bingo. \nHe hands it to Bucky. \nThe note: \"Girl ID'd as Elizabeth Ann Short, DOB 7/29/24, Medford, Mass.\" \nThe coroner steps back from the table. \nCORONER Questions? \nRUSS MILLARD What's your best guess? \nCORONER Here's what she wasn't. She wasn't raped, she wasn't pregnant, dried semen indicates voluntary intercourse within the last week...She took what I'd call a gentle whipping in the last ten days...In terms of the nitty-gritty...She was probably tortured with a knife for thirty- six to forty-eight hours before death. The cause of which is either the mouth wound or more likely she was beaten to death with something like a baseball bat. \nLEE What about her insides? \nCORONER They came out after death. Then I'd say he drained the blood from the body and washed it clean, probably in a bathtub. \nLEE Did the guy know anything about medicine or anatomy? \nCORONER Maybe. Probably not a surgeon type--but that doesn't rule out veterinary training, biological training, or my Pathology for Beginners class at UCLA. Has she got a name yet? \nThe cops look to each other, hesitant to speak her name. \nRUSS MILLARD Elizabeth Short. \nCORONER (saluting heaven) God love you, Elizabeth. (to Millard) Russell, when you get the son of a bitch who did this to her, give him a kick in the balls and tell him it's from Frederick D. Newbarr, M.D. Now all of you get out of here, I've got a date with a jumper suicide in ten minutes. \nINT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - LATER \nJack Tierney posts mug shots of Elizabeth Short as Russ, Harry, Lee and Bucky look over his shoulder. (In the background we can hear the by-now constant droning of Ellis Loew to reporters, both in person and over the phone) \nCAPTAIN JACK Cops popped her in '43. Santa Barbara. Underage drinking. Other than that she's clean. Four sisters. Parents divorced. Father's here in LA. Hear he sold some old portrait photos of her to the Herald. \nRuss makes a noise of disgust. \nRUSS MILLARD How many confessions so far? \nCAPTAIN JACK Eighteen. \nRUSS MILLARD Double that by morning. More if Loew got the press excited with his purple prose. \nLOEW (he's been eavesdropping) I'd say my prose fits the crime, Lieutenant. \nReveal Loew with Koenig and Fritz Vogel behind him. \nRUSS MILLARD Too much publicity is a hindrance, Ellis. If you were a policeman you'd know that. \nLoew flushes and gives Millard a dark look. \nELLIS LOEW (to Tierney) Captain have you sent men to talk to the victim's father? \nCAPTAIN JACK Not yet, Ellis. \nELLIS LOEW How about Vogel and Koenig? \nTierney looks to Millard. The second in command shakes his head ever so slightly. We understand that even though he's second in command to Jack he's in charge. \nCAPTAIN JACK Aaah, Russ, who do you think we should send? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DUSK \nA garage apartment at the rear of a big Victorian house. Lee and Bucky amble up and ring the buzzer. \nA skinny man (CLEO SHORT) in his fifties opens the door, eyeing them narrowly. \nCLEO SHORT Cops, huh? \nHe leads them inside. The apartment resembles its resident, soiled, worn and ugly. \nCLEO SHORT (cont'd) I've got an alibi, just in case you think I did it. Tighter than a crab's ass, and that is air tight. \nThe two cops sit down, sizing up his hostility. \nBUCKY I'm Detective Bleichert, Mr. Short. This is Sergeant Blanchard. We'd like to express our condolences for the loss of your daughter. \nCLEO SHORT I know who you are. Neither of you'da lasted a round with Gentleman Jim Jeffries. (beat) As for Betty, c'est la vie. She called the tune, she paid the piper. (beat) You wanna hear my alibi? \nLEE Since you're so anxious to tell it. \nCLEO SHORT Johnny on the spot at my job. Twenty- seven straight hours. Refrigerator repairman. Twenty-seven straight and the last seventeen overtime. Call my boss. He'll alibi me up tighter than a popcorn fart, and that's air tight. \nBUCKY When was the last time you saw your daughter? \nCLEO SHORT Betty came west in '43 with stars in her eyes. I promised her three squares and a five-spot if she kept the house tidy. \nThe cops look around at the squalor. \nCLEO SHORT (cont'd) Gave her the boot in July. She moved to Santa Barbara. Sent me a postcard couple weeks later. Some soldier beat her up bad. Last I heard from her. \nBUCKY Was that soldier her boyfriend? \nThe old man lets out a hoot. \nCLEO SHORT They were all her boyfriends! Not so ugly and wearing a uniform, can't go wrong there. Betty believed in quantity before quality. \nLEE You calling your own daughter a tramp? \nCLEO SHORT Got five daughters. One bad apple ain't so bad. \nLee's about to burst. Bucky motions for him to take a walk. Lee goes through the den into the bathroom. From his view Bucky can see Lee chase a couple pills with a glass of water... \nBUCKY Any names, Mr. Short? \nCLEO SHORT Tom, Dick, Harry. Don't matter. (he drifts for a moment) Said she was looking for movie work but...just paraded the Boulevard in those black get-ups of hers. \nLee returns to the room. \nCLEO SHORT (cont'd) Who wouldn't get herself killed doin' that? Who? Who wouldn't? \nEXT. CLEO SHORT'S APARTMENT - MINUTES LATER \n", "test1_id": 2172, "test2_input": "CLOSE ON THE WALL OF STILLS: \nA row of light-heavies: Gus Lesnevich, Billy Conn, and Bucky. Three stills over, next to Joe Louis, is Lee's photo. They all look so young...So good... \nAn old voice in English breaks his reverie: \nOLD MAN Bleichert? Jesus. First Blanchard, then you. Who's next? Willie Pep? \nBucky wheels and finds himself face to face with an old man. \nBUCKY Blanchard? You've seen him? When? \nOLD MAN Couple months ago. Heavy rains in February. Musta talked fights for ten hours straight. You know Blanchard thinks the feathers are the best division? me, it's the middies for sure. La Motta, Graziano-- \nBUCKY Is he still in town? \nOLD MAN Don't think so. I own this place. He ain't been back. You lookin' for a rematch? \nBUCKY I'm looking to get him out of a shitload of trouble. \nThe old pug looks him up and down. \nOLD MAN Well. I'll tell ya the little I know. Heard he caused a ruckus over at the Club Satan, had to bribe his way out big with Captain Vasquez. Talk to Ernie the cook. Tell him I said to be kosher with you. \nBUCKY Thank you. \nOLD MAN You ain't been in there. \nINT. CLUB SATAN - LATER \nBucky walks into the biggest sewer you have ever seen. The bar is a urinal trough where marines and sailors masturbate while going down on nude women squatting on the bartop. Blow jobs are being dispensed underneath tables facing the bandstand. \nUp on the stage a man in a Satan costume is fucking a woman on a mattress. Next to him, a donkey with red velvet horns pinned to his head eats hay out of a bowl while drunken servicemen shout \"Donkey! Donkey!\" \nBucky is accosted by a disgusting old woman. \nOLD WOMAN You wan' the bar, handsome? Breakfast of champions, one dollar. Round the world, two dollars. \nBUCKY Ernie. I need to see Ernie. \nOLD WOMAN Vamanos! \nAnd grabs him by the arm... \nINT. THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nERNIE, a half-Mexican half-Chinese man, stands next to a huge vat of stew. Bucky flashes Lee's photo. \nBUCKY I heard this man gave you some trouble a while back. \nERNIE Who wants to know? \nBucky flashes his badge, giving him a glimpse of his gun. \nERNIE You his friend? \nBUCKY He's my best friend. \nThe chef tucks his hands into his aprons, fidgeting. \nERNIE Your friend drink fourteen shots of my best Mescal, a house record. That I like. He make toasts to dead women. That I don't mind. But he try to fuck with my donkey show, and that I don't take. \nBUCKY What happened? \nERNIE Four of my guys he take, the fifth he don't. Rurales take him home to sleep it off. \nBUCKY That's it? \nErnie casually pulls a switchblade out of his apron and scratches the back of his neck with it. \nERNIE Finito. \nEXT. THE CLUB SATAN - LATER \nBucky walks outside and begins weaving his way back through the crowds. Out of the corner of his eye he catches a couple Rurales who seem to have taken an interest in him. \nHe dodges down an alley and cuts down another street, breaking into a slow jog. \nEXT. ANOTHER STREET - SECONDS LATER \nBucky walks backwards, checking the crowd. He's lost them. \nINT. THE FLEABAG MOTEL - LATER \nBucky stands in front of his door. He runs his finger up and down the door jamb. The hairs are gone. \nWith one swift kick he breaks down the door. \nINT. THE MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER \nA white man stands with his hands raised. \nMAN Whoa, Bleichert. I'm a friend-- \nBucky gestures with his gun for the man to hit the wall. He frisks him, pulling out a wallet and tossing on the bed. \nMAN (cont'd) Milton Dolphine, citizen of San Diego and a licensed private dick. I got seventy bucks in there but that money's jackshit compared to what Blanchard was holding. You go partners with me and it's easy street-- \nBucky kicks the man's legs out and pushes his to the floor. \nBUCKY You tell me all of it and you watch what you say about my partner, or it's a B&E roust and the Ensenada jail. \nDolphine pulls himself up. \nDOLPHINE You mean Vasquez? How do you think I knew to follow you? He's got a vested interest in you not finding out about Blanchard. \nBucky eyes the door. \nBUCKY Does he know I'm staying here? \nDOLPHINE No. \nBucky steps back from Dolphine. \nBUCKY So. Let's hear it. \nDOLPHINE About a month ago this Mexican woman shows up at my office in Dago. Chubby, ten tons a makeup, but dressed to the nines. Offers me five hundred to find Blanchard. Just like you I track him here where he's playing the rich gringo-- \nA FLASHBACK - LEE TEARING UP AN ENSENADA BAR \nDOLPHINE I even see him beat up two spics who insult this Senorita--Rurales stand by and do nothing. So I know he's paying protection dough. A lot of it. Then  I hear he paid off two plainclothes Rurale to snuff a coupla guys in TJ-- \nA FLASHBACK - BOBBY DE WITT AND FELIX CASCO BLOWN AWAY... \nDOLPHINE I leave a message in Dago for the woman tellin' her what I know... \nBUCKY What's her name? \nDOLPHINE Delores Garcia. But it was obviously a phony. Casco ran with some rich bimbos and I'm betting she's one of his. Revenge on Blanchard for offin' Felix. \nBucky tightens his grip on the slats of a wooden chair. This is hitting him hard. \nBUCKY Go on. \n", "test2_true": "Bucky's jaw clenches. \nDOLPHINE (cont'd) You wanna hear this? \nBUCKY Go on. \nDOLPHINE Blanchard's dead. Bullet in the cabeza. (beat) Rumor is they never found any money. \nBucky's head begins to reel... \nDOLPHINE (cont'd) Maybe the Rurales. Maybe that woman or friends of hers. Who knows? I figured Blanchard was rogue, figured someone like you'd come lookin' for him. Maybe have a line on where the cash was. You knew Blanchard, maybe we can-- \nBucky backhands Dolphine hard, knocking him off the chair. \nDOLPHINE (cont'd) Look I didn't know it was personal! Don't hit me again-- \nBucky has his gun out, leveled at Dolphine. \nBUCKY Prove it to me. Prove it! \nEXT. THE BACKROADS OF ENSENADA - NIGHT \nDolphine drives his car while Bucky trains his gun on him. \nThey come over a ridge and find themselves on a big bluff overlooking the ocean. A HUGE WOODEN BURNING CROSS marks the spot. \nDOLPHINE The locals keep the damn thing lit up. They got a lotta missing relatives. \nBUCKY You got a shovel? \nDOLPHINE Gardening tools-- \nBUCKY Good enough. \nEXT. THE BLUFF - LATER \nBucky scavenges a spare piece of picket fence, wraps it in a rag and lights a torch off of the cross. Dolphine kicks at a filthy American flag in the sand. \nDOLPHINE Here. Supposed to be near el bannero. \nCUT TO: \nA SMALL SHOVEL PUSHING INTO THE GROUND \nas Dolphine digs at gun point. After a few strokes the crunch of the shovel hitting bone. \nBucky terrified to look but has to know-- \n--a white jumper-- \nDOLPHINE Sailor's uniform. It's a sailor... \nBucky breathes out hard. Unbearable. Dolphine digs on, pushing the corpse out of the way and digging further into he sand. \nBucky can't stand the suspense. He tucks his gun into his waistband and grabs the shovel. After a few more strokes the thump of something solid. \nAnd suddenly it's there--sunburned pink skin, blond hair and stitch scars on the eyebrows. \nLee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard. \nAnd Bucky's in Dolphine's truck while Dolphine's screaming for him to wait and Bucky slams the truck in reverse, knocking the burning cross to the ground and grinding out out of the sand onto the road, heading north and leaving Dolphine and Lee alone at the grave...Heading north like a refugee... \nEXT. KAY'S HOUSE - DAWN \nBucky's car rolls up slowly as he kills the engine, trying not to make any noise. \nThe sun comes up, illuminating Bucky's filthy face as he watches the picture-perfect house, wishing time would stand still. Or better yet, wishing it would go back... \nFinally he gets out of the car and begins a long walk into the house. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA LAPD CHAPLAIN READING SOLEMNLY FROM A BIBLE \nBut as the camera PULLS BACK we see Bucky in his dress blues standing next to Kay in a wedding dress. \nEXT. THE BACKYARD OF KAY'S HOUSE \nRuss Millard and Harry Sears stand by as the only two guests. \nVOICE OVER Lee and Kay had lived in sin; not because their shack job was against department regs, but because the ghosts of their past had forced them to choose between love and passion, the veneer of a \"fairy tale\" only a band-aid for a fractured life. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLEE AND KAY DANCING TOGETHER \nas Harry and Russ drink from a punch bowl... \nVOICE OVER Our true vows were made in private; bury the past, bury our ghosts, and as Kay said, \"bury that fucking girl\"... \nANOTHER LAPD TRANSFER FORM: \"Officer Dwight Bleichert...Reassigned to: Scientific investigation Detail\" \nINT. THE LAPD SCIENCE LAB - DAY \nBucky with plastic gloves on typing blood with an eye dropper and a test tube. Meticulous and boring. \nNews radio plays in the background... \nA Detective pokes his head in: \nDETECTIVE Bleichert? You got those prints for me? \nBucky pulls a file out of a stack and gives it to him. The nonchalance of a man whose job has become routine. \nDETECTIVE (cont'd) Thanks. We gotta hot one I think. \nBucky smiles politely and returns to his desk. The radio: \nANNOUNCER ...results in the 1948 Republican primary are final...John Dougdale trouncing D.A. Ellis Loew 64% to 36%...In county primaries... \nThis gets a smile from Bucky as he returns to his test tubes and beakers. \nINT. AN APARTMENT - CRIME SCENE - DAY \nDetectives comb through a murder scene as Bucky collects latent fingerprints off doorknobs. No one pays him any attention. He's been relegated to the worst kind of purgatory. \nINT. THE KITCHEN - MORNING \nBucky and Kay drink coffee and read the morning paper. She absently strokes his free hand. \nBucky intently reads the front page. \nThe headline reads: \"CITY COUNCIL INVESTIGATES '20s BOOM BARONS FOR SHODDY HOME CONSTRUCTION\". \nUnderneath, a picture of Sprague and Mack Sennett posing in front of the HOLLYWOODLAND sign. \nHe's startled by Kay tapping her finger on the photo. \nKAY That reminds me of something, Dwight. \nBucky tries to hide his panic. \nBUCKY What? \n", "test2_id": 2173, "test3_input": "JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd) It's so nice of you to stop by again. Of course you've been staking out the Sprague house. Four nights in a row. (off his surprise) I walk my dog every night. And I'm almost as nosy as you. \nBUCKY (covering) Yeah, well. Old habits die hard. \nHe gets up from the table. \nINT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nBucky wanders over and stares at the slash-mouthed clown painting, always transfixed by it. \nJANE CHAMBERS (re the painting) I'd been thinking about giving it to charity, but it's too valuable. I found Eldridge's receipt... \nShe wanders into the study and fishes out some papers from her late husbands desk while Bucky continues to stare at the clown. She returns, reading from the sale slip. \nJANE CHAMBERS (cont'd) It's a Frederick Yannantuono original, inspired by an old classic novel--The Man Who Laughs by Victor Hugo. \nA FLASHBACK - THE GARDENING SHED \nA blood-spattered copy of The Man Who Laughs on the pile of pornography-- \nBACK TO SCENE \nAs the slash-mouthed clown towers over Bucky, his head buzzing... \nJANE CHAMBERS (cont'd) The clown in the painting is the book's main character, Gwynplain. When he was a child he had his mouth slashed ear to ear and then sold to the 16th century Spanish aristocracy to be used as a court jester. \nBucky steps back. \nJANE CHAMBERS (cont'd) Are you all right, Bucky? \nBUCKY Yes, I'm fine. \nHe focuses on her. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Where'd Eldridge get the painting? \nJANE CHAMBERS You'll appreciate the coincidence-- \nShe hands him the receipt. \nANGLE ON THE RECEIPT: \n\"Received from Eldridge Chambers, $3500 for the sale of the F. Yannantuono painting. Ramona Cathcart Sprague, January 15, 1947.\" \nSpeechless. \nJANE CHAMBERS What is it-- \nHe's out the door. \nEXT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - SAME \nBucky runs to his car, pulls out his gun. He sprints off down the street... \nEXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - SAME \nBucky waits outside, watching from behind a tree. He watches as the last of the cars, Madeleine's, pulls out of the driveway. \nHe crosses the street. He tries the front door, surprised to find it unlocked. He goes inside. \nINT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS \nGun drawn, Bucky cases the downstairs. He hears a noise. \nRAMONA I'm in here, officer. \nA red wave of sweat washes over him. He walks carefully into \nRAMONA'S SITTING ROOM \nwhere the matriarch sits on a tiny sofa, her arms lost in a silk dressing gown. Her face puffy and her eyes dark, her gray hair frizzy. \nBucky trains a gun on her. \nBUCKY I know what you did, Ramona. You and Georgia. I've seen the painting. You sold it the day of the murder. You know I've got the book. And now I've got you. \nShe smiles. Very slowly she withdraws one of her hands from the folds of her dressing gown. She holds a tiny ladylike revolver in her fingers and drops it at her feet. When she speaks, it's with complete control. \nRAMONA We see you out there, you know. Every night. We see you. You don't fool us. You didn't hurt Georgie. You didn't hurt Madeleine. And as much as I wish you would, you didn't hurt Emmett. You're a voyeur. That's all the lesser classes have. Pressing their nose up against the glass. \nBUCKY So tell me. Let me see. \nShe smiles at him again, loving his need. \nRAMONA Emmett slashed his face, I'm sure you know. Madeleine was eleven and she looked just like Georgie. When he got out of the hospital I gave him the Hugo book as a present. My Gwynplain. But he was afraid of Emmett's rage...After that...we rarely spoke. \nBucky eases himself into a chair opposite her. \nBUCKY Tell me about Betty Short. \nHer face hardens. \nRAMONA (cont'd) (with venom) It was the cruelest of jokes. He'd become obsessed with her...That filthy film. \nBUCKY Your husband bought her for George. \nRAMONA Emmett never stopped hating me. \nBUCKY For George-- \nRAMONA For being richer than he was. \nShe looks over her nose at him. \nRAMONA (cont'd) I followed them to the bungalow. There was a baseball bat under...under a tree...She tried to run from me...but she was drunk. The first swing knocked her out. I made Georgie tie her to the mattress....The second swing woke her up. \nBUCKY You tortured her. \nShe seems to drift. \nRAMONA (cont'd) She looked so much like my Maddy. It was...the cruelest of jokes. \nHer thousand yard stare gradually returns to Bucky. \nRAMONA (cont'd) Martha mustn't know. She's all that's left of this family that isn't dying. You consider her when you decide whether we're worth it. \nBucky's not sure what to say next. She fills the space quite well. \nRAMONA (cont'd) Honestly, though. Sometimes I thought Martha was going to bring the whole family down around her by chance. Her little stunt about tipping the police to LaVerne's-- \nBUCKY She lied about that. To get Madeleine's goat. \nRamona's eyes brighten up. \nRAMONA Oh is that so? You poor boy. Your life is worse than mine. Maybe the cruel joke is on you. \nShe speaks with such an insanity and calm it frightens him.

You knew it all! He took that hundred thousand and split to Mexico and you let him go! \nKay fingers the edges of an exam. She looks him in the eye. \nKAY You are so, so good at some things. \nHe absorbs the blow and waits for her to continue. \nKAY He was going to leave no matter what. I didn't know if I was ever going to see him again, and I wanted him to be comfortable if such a thing was possible. Dwight, he knew I was in love with you, and he wanted us to be together. \nBUCKY He didn't leave, he ran. He ran from the bank job, ran from the frame on DeWitt. He knew who killed Elizabeth Short and fucking ran away! This whole time. You both knew everything-- \nKay slams down a book. \nKAY Goddammit, Dwight! That girl--that girl! I don't give a damn about that girl. She ruined our lives! \nThe room grinds to a halt. \nKAY (cont'd) He loved us. Don't take that away from him. And I love you.

(beat) So if you're aware of something more important than that...I'd like to hear what it is. \nBucky looks like he's about to burst. He wants to go to her, lock her in his arms and forgive. instead, he just backs up three steps, slowly turns on his heels, and walks out. \nINT. A BAR - NIGHT \nBucky sits in the back of the bar, shrouded in smoke and loud music. He drinks bourbon and watches Madeleine over at the bar. She's got her hand on a soldier's knee. \nEXT. THE RED ARROW INN - NIGHT \nMadeleine Sprague and the soldier boy walk from the office over to the now familiar Room 11. They enter, shutting the door and flicking on the light to reveal \nBUCKY \nsitting on the back of a chair with his feet on the seat. He trains his silenced pistol on them. Flashing his badge, he points the soldier to the door: \nBUCKY (quoting Lee) Adios yourself back to the Halls of Tripoli, shitbird. I've got business with the lady. \nYou don't have to tell the soldier twice. He backs out and shuts the door. \nBUCKY I've been pointing my gun at a lot of people this week. But I haven't had much of a chance to shoot anybody. Whattya think? \nMADELEINE I think you'd rather fuck me than kill me. But you don't have the guts to do either. You're a boxer. Not a puncher. \nBucky smiles. \nBUCKY (Scotchman's burr) Aaaah, lassie. You wanna sell me short to the very end, eh? \nNow she's curious. \nBUCKY (cont'd) It's not as good as yours, I'll admit. But then again you've got an ear for accents. Accents, dressing up in costumes... \nMaybe a trace of fear in her eyes... \nBUCKY (cont'd) Do another one for me. Play someone else. Rich little slut...Lez...Daddy's girl...Dahlia...Play someone else. Do another. \nMADELEINE I don't know what you're talking about-- \nHe cocks the gun. \nBUCKY How 'bout the Mexican accent you used when you hired the private dick to track down Lee. Let's see the make-up job. Let's see the fucking dress, mamacita, that you wore when you chased after poor daddy's money. Tell me something--you shoot Lee yourself? \nShe steps back against the door as he advances. \nBUCKY (cont'd) Did you at least have the guts to shoot him yourself? \nHe puts the gun to her forehead. \nMADELEINE You'll never do it. Never. Remember...I look like her. \nShe grins wickedly. \nHe pulls the gun from her head and shoots her in the kneecap. \nEXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER \nCap cars, flashing lights, an ambulance. \nVOICE OVER We took the fall together. \nINT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER \nMadeleine is interrogated by Homicide dicks. \nVOICE OVER Ever the consummate actor, Madeleine Sprague confessed to killing Lee by concocting a love triangle from the three of us...The Bleichert/Blanchard rematch fought over her hand, with Lee beating Emmett and demanding he \"hand over\" his daughter when she preferred me. \nEXT. THE ENSENADA STREETS - NIGHT - FLASHBACK \nAs Madeleine, dressed as a Mexican woman in heavy makeup and a large hat, tails Lee back to his motel... \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) Madeleine stalking Lee...Revenge-killing him in Ensenada to avenge the Sprague honor...No mention of the Black Dahlia murder case at all. \nEXT. THE COURTHOUSE - DAY \nMadeleine led away amongst a flock of photographers. Her family linked arm-and-arm in the background, crying, only Martha looking like she might survive... \nVOICE OVER (cont'd) Her story's enough to get her a psych tag as a delusional schizophrenic and ten years at Atascadero State Hospital. \nINT. THE POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY \nBucky sits at a table, staring into the one-way mirror. \n", "test3_id": 2174}

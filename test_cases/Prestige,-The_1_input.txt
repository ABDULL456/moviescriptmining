The Judge follows Cutter, approaching a collection of magical apparatus, including a MASSIVE CRATE. Cutter looks up at it with AWE, touching the side where it says "COLORADO SPRINGS". 
JUDGE What's in there? 
Cutter OPENS it, revealing metal and glass MACHINERY within. 
CUTTER Angier's machine. 
JUDGE You built this, Mr.Cutter? 
CUTTER 
(SHAKES HEAD) Oh no. This wasn't built by a magician... it was built by a wizard. 
(OFF LOOK) A man who can actually do the things a magician pretends to... 
Cutter closes the crats. The JUDGE turns to other props. 
CUTTER (CONT'D) your honour, what will happen to these things when the trial is over? 
The Judge is staring at a large glass tank. 
JUDGE They've benn sold to a Lord Caldlo. An avid collector, apparently very interested in the case. 
CUTTER Don't let him take this. 
The Judge looks over. Cutter is touching the crate. 
JUDGE Why ever not? 
CUTTER It's dangerous. 
JUDGE I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's get some simple and disappointing trick. 
CUTTER The most disappointing of all- it has no trick. It's real. 
The Judge looks at Cutter. Smiles indulgently. Turns. 
JUDGE This is the tank Angier drowned in? 
Cutter turns to look at the empty, smashed glass of the tank. Nods. Cutter indicates the top of the tank, where there is a PADLOCK. Cutter pushes down on a panel of the lid- 
CUTTER This lets the performer's hands reach the trick padlock... 
-a small section POPS open. 
JUDGE A standard magical apparatus for escapes? 
CUTTER With one important difference... 
Cutter grabs the PADLOCK. Rattles it. 
CUTTER (CONT'D) This isn't a trick lock... it's been switched out for a real one. 
The Judge stares at the tank, appaled. 
JUDGE What a way to kill someone. Why in God's name go to such lengths? 
CUTTER These are magicians, you honour. Showmen. Men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths to amaze. To shock. 
JUDGE Even without and audience? 
Cutter stares at the tank- 
INSERT CUT: ANGIER SCREAMING BUBBLES. 
CUTTER There was and audience. (looks at Judge) See, the water tank had a particular signinficance for the two men... 
INT. THEATRE -- EVENING 
Onstage, A SIMILAR TANK FILLED WITH WATER. 
CUTTER (V.O.) A particular awful significance... 
Julia stands next to the tank. Milton adresses the audience. 
MILTON Which of you brave souls is willing bind this lovely young woman? 
Milton gestures to Julia- the crowd goes wild. Julia makes a show of deciding. She picks up Angier and Borden, who are made up to look different from the last performance. As they leap up onto stage, Borden makes eye contact with Cutter in the wings- Cutter's is a WARNING GLANCE. 
As Angier ties Julia's ankles he can't resist tickling just under her toes- she KICKS him in the chin. 
Borden starts to wrap the rope around Julia's wrists in a particular fashion. Stops. Reconsiders. Julia NODS at him, encouring. Borden starts RETRYING the knot. 
Cutter watches. His hand checking for the axe handle. 
Borden tests the rope- it is tight. Julia gives him the sign with her eyes- he steps back. Angier rises to his feet, grinning at Julia. As she raises her arms to the hook, she can't quite hide her smile back at him. 
Milton gives the sign and Julia is HOISTED into the air. Cutter slips his STOPWATCH out of his pocket as Milton moes the tank under Julia's bare feet. 
Angier looks up at Julia. Proud. She stares out over the audience, preparing herself. Looks down at Angier, smiling... 
Julia PLUNGES into the tank- Milton SLAMS the lid shut- Cutter checks his stopwatch, hand caressing the axe handle... 
Milton raises the curtain around the tank, then circles it, working his "magic". Angier shifts a little. Time passing... Milton looks at Cutter- TOO MUCH TIME... 
Cutter GRASPS his axe and SPRINT at the tank- Milton RIPS the curtain down- Julia, one arm free, is CONVULSING... 
Angier and Borden look on in HORROR as Cutter SWINGS his axe into the glass- which CRACKS... cutter SWINGS again and again- the web of crackes GROWING, Julia's convulsions SLOWING, her eyes PLEADING with Angier's, until- 
CRASH- the glass gives way, FLOODING the stage- Cutter and Angier GRASP at Julia- FULL her onto the stage- Cutter ELBOWS Angier out of the way to POUND on Julia's chest- Borden wacthes, stunned, as Julia FLOPS, LIFELESS, onto the boards. Cutter looks up at Angier, stricken. 
Angier takes Julia in his arms, looking down at her staring eyes. He desperately BRUSHES water from Julias cheeks and forehead. Borden looks on, shen. 
BORDEN (V.O.) How often I've fought with my self over that night .. one half of me swearing bling that i tied a simple slip knot... the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double. I suppose I'll never know for sure- 
INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- DAY

Cut to Paul screaming horribly in the desert. 
235. INT. JESSICA'S ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT 
Alia walks forward in the very dark room.  Blood rushes from her nose.  She forces herself to walk to Jessica's bed.  She finds that Jessica's nose is bleeding also.  Jessica wakes in pain.  They stare at each other in the darkness. 
JESSICA ALIA! 
ALIA Mother - help me! 
JESSICA (struggling) Alia!  What is it? ALIA It's Paul.  He's taken the Water of Life. 
233C.     INT. PAUL'S MIND 
Cut to quiet black - dissolve again to blue - another drop - low thud - quietness - fade to black. 
245A.     EXT. EMPEROR'S SPACESHIP - SPACE 
The Emperor's space ship soars towards us. 
246. INT. EMPEROR'S SPACE SHIP - SPACE 
The Reverend Mother Helen Mohiam is on the floor, bleeding from the nose and weak from pain.  The Emperor looks on in horror. 
233D.     INT. PAUL'S MIND 
Suddenly screaming towards us is white rings, stars and a huge Guild Navigator. 
233E.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 
Cut to Paul's eyes - tightly closed, oozing fresh blood.

SCREAMING SOUND.  Paul's mouth opens and a giant wind is stirred on the desert. 
234. (Deleted) 
235A.     INT. PAUL'S MIND 
Navigator chewing giant eye and spewing blood and light and sounds.  Paul's mouth double exposes over Navigator and eye.  The sound from Paul's mouth destroys the Navigator and opens the Alam. Navigator bursts into a huge light ring and we quickly travel through ring after ring and masses of liquid stars.  The light increases until it is blinding and then in the light... 235B.     EXT. FLOWER BLOSSOMING 
A golden flower blossoms and glows brilliantly - suddenly the powerful sound of an approaching worm.

240. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 
Chani and the Fedaykin freeze and watch in horror as seven giant worms converge on them.  The worms break the desert surface and rise, towering over them. The worms hover and wait.

240A.     EXT. DESERT - DAY 
Chani looks to the Fedaykin, then they look at Paul who lies motionless.  She cuts the rope bonds with her crysknife.  Her fingers tremble as does the whole of the desert. 
Paul's eyes snap open.  He sits up slowly.  Chani stares at him in awe. 
CHANI Paul... Paul. 240B.     EXT. WAVE CRASHING 
A huge wave crashes and Paul sees the image of his father.  Paul slowly gets to his knees, then stands. 
240C.     EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 
PAUL Father!...  Father!  THE SLEEPER HAS AWAKENED. 
Giant echoes of this phrase reverberate across the vast desert.  The worms bend back into the sand and leave with thundering power. 
MUSIC FULL.

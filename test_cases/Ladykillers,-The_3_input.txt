DORR Madam, I shudder. I quake. The revulsion I feel for modern popular music, and all other manifestations of contemporary decay, is, I have no doubt, the equal of y'own. Why, we play music that was composed to the greater glory of God. Devotional music. Church music. 
MRS. MUNSON Gospel music? 
DORR Well-inspired by the gospels, certainly. The vintage, of course, is no more recent than the Rococo. 
MRS. MUNSON Rococo, huh? Well, I guess that'd be okay. 
DORR But I certainly don't propose to inflict our rehearsals on you. May I enquire -- do you have a root cellar? 
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT 
Dorr ducks while descending the steep, narrow stair in order to avoid an overhead beam. He is followed by Mrs. Munson. 
DORR Yes, yes, yes, this looks promising... 
He pulls on a hanging string to light a bare bulb overhead. 
MRS. MUNSON Little dank, ain't it? 
DORR Oh, indeed, but that only improves the acoustics... 
He experimentally claps his hands. 
DORR ...Marvelous. These earthen walls are ideal for baffling the higher registers of the, uh, lute and, uh, sackbutt. That's why so much music of the cinquecento was played in crypts and catacombs. Yes, this will do nicely... 
He dry-washes his hands with enthusiasm, but his tone remains mournful. 
DORR ...This is perfect. This is more than perfect. I can scarcely contain my glee. 
MRS. MUNSON You containing it okay. 
He starts to peel cash out of a large, well-worn billfold: 
DORR Allow me to pay you a week in advance. Allow me to pay you two weeks in advance. Allow me to pay you a month in advance. I cannot countenance the thought of these charming apartments being tenanted by someone unappreciative of their special je ne sais quoi. 
MRS. MUNSON That would be a shame. 
INT. CASINO - DAY 
TRACKING ON A GARBAGE CART 
On the cart is a boombox. It is playing "I Left My Wallet in El Segundo." 
It is being pushed through a casino empty of customers. 
As the cart stops and a wastebasket is emptied into it: 
VOICE (V.O.) You gotta peel this shit out sticks to the bottom. 
WIDER 
shows two youngish black men in the khaki uniforms of custodians. Emptying the wastebasket is WEEMACK-MACKATEE FUNTHES. He is instructing GAWAIN MACSAM. 
WEEMACK ...You wouldn't believe this shit, sometimes even out here on the casino floor you gonna find sanitary napkin shit stuck there, Tucks, I don't know what the fuck people do while they're gambling here man. 
GAWAIN I ain't peelin' funky shit with my human hands, man. That's a prescription for disease and viruses and shit, attackin' y'insides. 
As they roll on we see more of the gambling floor, which is on something less than the scale of a Las Vegas casino. The floor is not yet open and dealers stack and count chips at the tables, pit bosses with clipboards looking over their shoulders. Other dealers strap on visors and sleeve garters, preparing to work. 
WEEMACK You gotta do it. Mr. Gudge checks everything. Man is a motherfuck. Shit -- looka this. 
After a furtive look around he plucks a chip from the next wastebasket and slips it in his pocket. 
WEEMACK ...You keep an eye out, man. I found a hundred-dollar chip once. 
GAWAIN Fuck that, man. I ain't pawin' through used Tucks for a fi' dollar chip. 
WEEMACK I said it was a hundred. 
GAWAIN Man, your guts gonna turn to soup'n leak outcha fuckin' asshole. 
SERVICE HALL 
The cart jitters loudly on the dimpled plastic floor. 
WEEMACK This tunnel leads back onto land. To the office for all the people work for Mannex. Mannex Corporation. Owns the Lady Luck 'n three other boats... 
INT. CASINO - SERVICE HALL - DAY 
The two men are entering a windowless fluorescent-lit office area. A row of wooden office doors and one heavy steel door. 
WEEMACK ...This is where they think on their corporate shit, Gudge and them. 
He stops to empty a wastebasket. 
WEEMACK ...The lights is ugly but it ain't as many Tucks. 
He bangs on the steel door: 
WEEMACK ...YO, motherfuck! Lemme in!

STOKELY Cause he does all his best work on his knees. 
Stokely almost chokes with laughter- 
MACEO Never mind him, he just a drunk- 
STOKELY I hear she put a ring through it and use it to yank him around the house. 
Slick starts to rise but Maceo puts a hand on his arm- 
MACEO You know Tyrone don't allow no scufflin here, Slick. 
STOKELY I oughta get me a old woman too, take care of the groceries. Just got to sweet-talk her some, give her a good poke now and then- 
MACEO You gonna drink, Stokely, or you gonna lay out back recoverin from that busted head you about to get? 
DELILAH Gentlemen- 
They all turn to see DELILAH, Ty's wife, coming out from the back of the club. She is dressed for church- 
SLICK (doffs his hat)    Miss Delilah- 
DELILAH Let's behave ourselves. (sees) What are you boys doing in here? Out! 
Lonnie and Scratch, busted, hurry out.   Delilah turns her attention to China Doll- 
DELILAH And what are you doing behind that bar? 
CHINA DOLL It's just for a minute. 
DELILAH That's sixty seconds too long. Maceo, you get back there and take that child's place. 
China Doll mopes as she steps out from behind- 
DELILAH You bring people their food. Don't you be messing with their liquor. 
CHINA DOLL Nobody's eating. 
DELILAH That's cause nobody's here but these couple lost souls, haven't had an appetite since they give over to the devil. 
Maceo gets behind the counter as Delilah heads for Ty at the door- 
BERTHA MAE At Pinetop's Honeydripper That's where I get my cold can beer At Pinetop's Honeydripper That's where I get my cold can beer- 
Maceo reluctantly moves down to take the order of NADINE, a large, handsome woman with a prominent gold tooth who has just stepped in- 
NADINE Evenin, Maceo. You lookin good tonight. 
MACEO Likewise, Miss Nadine.   What can I do for you? 
NADINE (flirting) You know what you can do for me, sweet man. 
Maceo tries to slip the hook and be polite at the same time- 
MACEO What would you like to drink? 
DOORWAY 
Ty watches the CROWD in front of the Ace of Spades.   Delilah comes up to join him, indicates his drink- 
DELILAH How many is that tonight? 
TY Don't dog me about that, baby.   Not tonight. 
DELILAH I don't want China Doll behind that bar. 
TY She got to help out. 
DELILAH Not there she doesn't. You know she's not sposed to get excited- 
TY Not much chance of that in here. (wistful) Harvest hands all been crowdin into Toussaint's place. The young ones. 
DELILAH You'll get some of them. 
TY They stick their noses in here, get one little sniff of the music, and they gone. 
DELILAH (joking)   Maybe that's the wages of sin.

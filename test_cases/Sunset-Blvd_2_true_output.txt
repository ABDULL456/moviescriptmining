GILLIS Where are your...? 
He realizes he's forgotten them, takes the dollar and hands it back to her. 
GILLIS Norma, you're smoking too much.

D-7     LIVING ROOM, NORMA DESMOND'S HOUSE (EARLY AFTERNOON) 
Start on a tiny                       GILLIS' VOICE parasol being             Whenever she suspected I twirled...Norma           was getting bored, she peeks out from one        would put on a live show side of the parasol,      for me: the Norma Desmond a bandanna tied           Follies.  Her first number around her head with      was always the Mack Sennett a rabbit's-ear bow.       Bathing Beauty. She bats her eyes, winks roguishly. 
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that Norma's black pyjama trousers are rolled up over her knees and her black stockings rolled down below them.  The whole effect approximates a Mack Sennett bathing costume pretty effectively.  She points at a leather pour. 
NORMA This is a rock. 
She climbs on it, pantomimes timidity, an attempted dive, then jumps off. 
Gillis lolls on a couch, watching the performance, very bored. 
NORMA I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum? 
GILLIS (Lighting a cigarette with a match) Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more. 
NORMA (Taking the match) All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes. 
She runs out of the                 GILLIS' VOICE picture.  Gillis has      Something was the matter, closed his eyes.          all right.  I was thinking THE CAMERA MOVES to       about that girl of Artie's, his face.                 that Miss Schaefer.  She was so like all us writers when we first hit Holly- wood -- itching with am- bition, panting to get your names up there: Screenplay by.  Original Story by.  Hmph!  Audiences don't know somebody sits down and writes a picture. They think the actors make it up as they go along. 
NORMA'S VOICE Open your eyes. 
Gillis opens his eyes. 
Norma has equipped herselr with a derby hat, a cane, and blacked in a small moustache.  She goes into a little Chaplin routine.  While she is doing it, the telephone rings.  After a moment Max comes to the living room door. 
MAX Madame is wanted on the telephone. 
NORMA You know better than to interrupt me. 
MAX Paramount is calling. 
NORMA Who? 
MAX Paramount studios. 
NORMA (To Gillis) Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it. 
MAX It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important. 
NORMA Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me! 
MAX I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners. 
NORMA Say that I'm busy, and hang up. 
MAX Very good, Madam. 
He bows and exits. 
NORMA How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes. 
GILLIS Maybe deMille is shooting. 
NORMA I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.

ALLEN Because I don't want to be the person they think I am. I'm on academic probation. I could be kicked out. You can't leave. You started something and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do next. 
Lucien, moved. 
ALLEN It's our turn. Let's show them what we can do. 
At the thought of payback, Lucien awakens. Allen grins. 
ALLEN You in? 
INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY 
A hard STAMP on a library request: RESTRICTED. 
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN You must not drink while you're handling it. And no writing in it. 
Allen, Lucien, Jack and Bill spy on the PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN and a female PAGE at the main desk. The librarian places a KEY RING in a drawer. 
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN It must come back exactly as you found it. 
The Permissions Librarian heads off. Seeing the young page alone, Jack tucks in his shirt, SLICKS his hair down. Jabs a piece of gum from his mouth into Lucien's palm. 
JACK No telling Edie, got it? 
Jack strolls up to the desk. Winks at the page. 
JACK I see you checking out all these books. And I'm asking myself: do you ever get checked out? 
She radiates. Bill looks at his watch. 
BILL 25 seconds. Masterful. 
But then, another page, GWENDOLYN (20, sweet and saucy), joins the first. 
LUCIEN Damn! Shift's over. 
Jack looks back, shrugs as he walks off with the first page. Lucien groans, plan's 86'd. But Allen sits up. 
ALLEN I'll go. 
INT. PERMISSIONS DESK, LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY 
Allen walks up to the desk. 
ALLEN Hi. 
Gwendolyn looks up. Allen is smiling nervously. 
ALLEN I wondered if you could help me. 
GWENDOLYN Sure. 
ALLEN I'm looking for a book. 
GWENDOLYN Okay. Does this book have a title? 
ALLEN It's called The Day Amanda Came. 
GWENDOLYN (knowing look) Well, you'll have to wait. I can't leave the desk. 
Allen turns back to Lucien who nods, eggs him on. 
ALLEN But...I really need it. 
Gwendolyn looks around. 
GWENDOLYN (flirting) Okay. Only for you. 
She places a sign on the desk: "HELPING A READER. BACK IN 5 MINUTES." 
They head off the stacks, Lucien bounds up to the desk, glides over the top, and digs through the drawer. 
Old cards. Broken pencils. NO KEYS. 
LUCIEN Shit! 
60   INT. STACKS - DAY                                           60 
CLOSE UP: THE KEYS in Gwendolyn's hand as Allen and Gwendolyn walk through the stacks.

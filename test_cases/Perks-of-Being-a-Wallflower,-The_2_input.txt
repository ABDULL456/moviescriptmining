GANG "Merry Christmas!" "Good luck at your dad's!" "See you at New Year's!" 
Patrick approaches Charlie in the doorway. 
CHARLIE Have a good time at your mom's. 
PATRICK Thanks. And Charlie... since you were born on Christmas Eve, I figure you don't get a lot of birthday presents. So, I thought you should have my clock. From the heart. 
CHARLIE Thank you, Patrick. 
Sam gives Charlie one last hug.       Patrick and Sam watch their friends leave. 
PATRICK I love you guys!

We fly as high as Charlie feels.      Above the city on Christmas Eve. 
69   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         69 
The front door opens, revealing Charlie's dad. 
FATHER Hey!   Look who's here! 
He moves out of the way, and standing there is Charlie's older brother, CHRIS KELMECKIS (19). Chris is handsome, charismatic, and an all around winner. 
CHRIS Come here, little sister. 
CANDACE Hey, Chris. 
Big hug.    Chris smiles big and "son flirts" with his mom. 
CHRIS Ma, you look so thin! 
MOTHER 10 pounds... Weight Watchers. 
Big kiss.   When he lets go, he sees Charlie and smiles. 
CHRIS Charlie... 
Chris and Charlie look at each other in silence. Then, hug. As the family moves into the dining room to celebrate, Chris gives him a quiet... 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Happy birthday. 
70   INT. CHARLIE'S DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                           70 
MOTHER Make a wish, honey. 
We move closer to Charlie as he makes his wish and blows out his 16 candles.

71   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (PRESENT)                            71 
The wind blows out a candle in one of the luminaria bags. The suburb is quiet. Not a creature is stirring. Except... 
Charlie. He fills a brown paper bag with    sand and a candle. He lights the candle, making the bag glow   like a beautiful lantern. He looks down his street, where    families are out with their kids, doing the same luminaria   ritual. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
72   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          72 
The same street. Christmas Eve. Many years ago. Aunt Helen and the kids finish their luminaria bags. Aunt Helen lights up the candles. They glow. 
AUNT HELEN Can you see it, Charlie? The luminaria is a landing strip for Santa Claus. 
The image goes wide. All of these bags glowing.     Beautiful. Aunt Helen rattles her keys. Whispers. 
AUNT HELEN (CONT'D) Keep an eye out for him with your brother and sister. I'll be right back. 
She bends down and whispers into his ear. 
AUNT HELEN (CONT'D) I'm going to get your birthday present.

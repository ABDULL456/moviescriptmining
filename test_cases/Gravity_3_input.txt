TITLE- 
GRAVITY 
BLACK- 
OUTER SPACE, 600 KILOMETERS ABOVE- 
PLANET EARTH. 
Like all images of Earth seen from space, this image of our planet is mythical and majestic. 
The globe seems almost tangible, slowly spinning, floating in the endless void of space. It is a blue planet, and bright white clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the deep blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents: green, yellow and brown. 
It is noon in Cape Town and early night in India. 
The sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened sliver on its Eastern edge. It is beautiful! And so full of life. 
But not here. 
Here it is completely silent. 
SILENCE- 
IN THE DISTANCE- 
A small metal object crosses the empty space surrounding Earth. If it appears to be a small satellite that is only because it is far away from us. It is the size of one football field. It is- 
The INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS). 
It resembles a dragonfly. Its solar panels stretch out, like wings, from the long body made of connected pressurized modules. 
It floats with a sense of proud achievement. 
It orbits at an altitude of 500 km above sea level. It moves at an average of 27,700 kilometers per hour, completing 15.7 laps around the Earth per day. 
It is cruising over Zimbabwe. To the East, the island of Madagascar. Up to the North, the expansive dry lands of Somalia and Ethiopia. 
Soon, the ISS curves around the spherical planet, and it becomes smaller, almost indistinguishable, no more than a small bright spec grazing over the blue atmosphere. 
CLOSER TO US- 
Orbiting at an altitude of 600 km- 
The EXPLORER SPACE SHUTTLE becomes visible. 
This icon of space exploration has played a key role in all of NASA's missions since the late 90's. 
Faintly we hear static, voices murmuring over radio frequences. As the babble bulds we might hear one conversation amongst the REST: 
MISSION CONTROL (On radio, faint) Explorer, please verify that the P1 ATA removal on replacement cap part 1 and 2 are complete. EXPLORER CAP (On radio, faint) DMA M1, M2, M3 and M4 are complete. 
MISSION CONTROL (On radio, faint) Copy that Explorer. Dr Stone-Houston, requesting status update... 
A fizz of static and then the voice continues with sudden, starling clarity. 
RYAN Installation ninety-five percent complete. Running level one diagnostics on circuits, sensors, and power. Standby. 
MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO) Standing by. Looks like we're on schedule. Dr. Stone, Medical is concerned about your ECG readings. 
RYAN I'm fine Houston. 
MISSION CONTROL (RADIO) Well, medical doesn't agree doctor. Are you feeling nauseous?

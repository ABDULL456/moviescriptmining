{"train": "EXT. SPACE A vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity. \nThere is unrest in the Galactic Senate Several hundred solar systems under the leadership of the rebel leader, Count Dooku, have decalred their intentions to secede from the Republic. \nThis separatist movement has made it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Kights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy. \nSenator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to Coruscant to vote on the critical issue of creating an army to assist the overwhelmed Jedi. \nPAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters. \nEXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet. \nEXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN Two Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform. \nA small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden. \nOne of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT. \nCAPTAIN TYPHO We made it. I guess I was wrong, there was no danger at all. \nThe ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation. \nThe DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed. \nKlaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA. \nPADM\u00c9 Cord\u00e9... \nShe gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Cord\u00e9's eyes are open. She looks up at her. \nCORD\u00c9 ... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I... \nCORD\u00c9 dies. PADM\u00c9 hugs her. \nAMIDALA No!... No!... No!... \nPADM\u00c9 lowers CORD\u00c9 to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the devastation. There are tears in her eyes. \nAMIDALA I should not have come back. \nCAPTAIN TYPHO M'Lady, you are still in danger. \nAmidala says nothing. \nCAPTAIN TYPHO This vote is very important. You did your duty and Cord\u00e9 did hers. Now come. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady, please! \nShe turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them. \nEXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off. \nINT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter. \nMAS AMEDDA Order! We shall have order! The motion for the Republic to commission an army takes precedent, and that is what we will vote on at this time. \nEverything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium. \nPALPATINE ...My esteemed colleagues, excuse me... I have just received some tragic and disturbing news. Senator Amidala of the Naboo system... Has been assassinated! \nThere is a shock silence in the vast arena. \nPALPATINE (continued) This grievous blow is especially personal to me. Before I became Chancellor, I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great leader who fought for justice, not only in this honourable assembly, but also on her home planet. She was so loved she could have been elected queen for life. She believed in public service, and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom... and as a dear friend. \nThere is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena. \nSENATOR ASK AAK How many more Senators will die before this civil strife ends! We must confront these rebels now, and they need an army to do it. \nA second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM. \nAMBASSADOR DARSANA Why weren't the Jedi able to stop this assassination? We are no longer safe, under their protection. \nSenator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod. \nMACE WINDU You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He wouldn't assassinate anyone, it is not in his character. \nKI-ADI-MUNDI He is a political idealist, not a murderer. \nYODA In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are. \nPALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city. \nPALPATINE Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end? \nPADM\u00c9 I don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it... \nAfter gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to Mace. \nPALPATINE Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces. \nBAIL ORGANA Do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times? \nPADM\u00c9 Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the... \nPALPATINE ...\"situation is that serious.\" No, but I do, Senator. \nPADM\u00c9 Chancellor, please! I don't want any more guards! \nPALPATINE I realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... Master Kenobi... \nPALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back. \nMACE WINDU That's possible. He has just returned from a Border dispute on Ansion. \nPALPATINE You must remember him, M'Lady... he watched over you during the blockade conflict. \nPADM\u00c9 This is not necessary, Chancellor. \nPALPATINE Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is unbearable. \nAMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave. \nMACE WINDU I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, M'Lady. \nYODA leans into her ear. \nYODA Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padm\u00e9. Accept our help. \nAs the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his desk. \nPALPATINE I will not like this Republiv, that has stood for over a thousand years, be split in two \nEXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - TWILIGHT A graceful skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant. \nINT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR - EVENING The door to the apartment slides open. JAR JAR walks into the corridor, where TWO JEDI are exiting the elevator. He recognises OBI-WAN and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his hand. \nJAR JAR Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo! \nOBI-WAN smiles. \nOBI-WAN It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar. \nJAR JAR Oops! Wheresa mesa manners? Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I completely forgot myself for a moment there. I have had to learn Diplodiaclect... speak it like a native now. Don't really see the point, actually, but members of the Senate seem to prefer it... \nJAR JAR notices OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE. \nJAR JAR (continuing) ...and this, I take it, is your apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie? Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie? (Looks at Anakin) Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen! Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no believen. \nANAKIN Hi, Jar Jar. \nJAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug. \nJAR JAR Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii! \nINT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT - EVENING PADME is in a conference with CAPTAIN TYPHO and DORME. JAR JAR enters the room, followed by the TWO JEDI. \nOBI-WAN (continuing) You know I don't like it when you do that! \nANAKIN Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now! \nZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN. \nOBI-WAN What are you doing? He's gonna blast me! \nANAKIN Right - this isn't working. \nANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops. \nOBI-WAN That was too close! \nANAKIN Clear that! \nOBI-WAN What?? \nANAKIN Clear the flag! We're losing power! Hurry! \nOBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power. \nOBI-WAN Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I don't  like it when you do that! \nANAKIN So sorry, Master. \nThey chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery. \nOBI-WAN It's dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Don't go through there! \nHuge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass. \nOBI-WAN (continuing) Yiiii, what are you doing? \nANAKIN Sorry, Master! \nOBI-WAN (sarcastically) Oh, that was good... \nANAKIN That was crazy!!! \nZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches. \nANAKIN (continuing) Ahh, damn. \nOBI-WAN Stop!! \nANAKIN No, we can make it. \nANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder. \nOBI-WAN I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm crazy. \nANAKIN But it worked... we made it. \nOBI-WAN (angrily) It didn't work... we've stalled! And you almost got us killed! \nANAKIN I think we're still alive. \nANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life. \nOBI-WAN (very angrily) It was stupid! \nANAKIN (sheepishly) I could have made it... \nOBI-WAN (furious) But you didn't!!! And now we've lost him. \nSuddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off. \nANAKIN No we didn\u0092t... \nOut of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right \nANAKIN I try, Master. \nINT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them \nOBI-WAN Why do I think you are going to be the death of me?! \nANAKIN Don't say that Master... You're the closest thing I have to a father... I love you. I don't want to cause you pain. \nOBI-WAN Then why don't you listen to me?! \nANAKIN I will. I'll do better, I promise. \nOBI-WAN Do you see him him? \nANAKIN I think he's a she... \nOBI-WAN Then be extra careful... (nods to a room) Check it out. \nOBI-WAN goes away. \nANAKIN Where are you going, Master? \nOBI-WAN To get a drink. \nOBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN. \nCLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass. \nELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO Wanna buy some death sticks? \nOBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly. \nOBI-WAN You don't want to sell me death- sticks. \nELAN I don't want to sell you death- sticks. \nOBI-WAN moves his fingers. \nOBI-WAN You want to go home and rethink your life. \nELAN I want to go home and rethink my life. \nHe leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back. \nCLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar. \nANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back. \nThe drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads. \nThe room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing. \nANAKIN Easy... Official business. Go back to your drinks. \nSlowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out. \nEXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods. \nOBI-WAN Do you know who it was you were trying to kill? \nZAM WESSEL The Senator from Naboo. \nOBI-WAN Who hired you? \nZAM glares at OBI-WAN. \nZAM WESSEL It was just a job. \nANAKIN Tell us! \nZAM WESSEL That Senator's gonna die soon anyway, and the next one won't make the same mistake I did... \nPADM\u00c9 I'm sorry... You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when he didn't get his way. \nANAKIN I'm not whining! I'm not. \nPADME just smiles at him. DORME laughs in the background. \nPADM\u00c9 I didn't say it to hurt you. \nANAKIN I know... \nThere is a brief silence. PADME comes over to ANAKIN. \nPADME Anakin... \nThey look into each other's eyes for the first time. \nPADM\u00c9 (continuing) Don't try to grow up too fast. \nANAKIN I am grown up. You said it yourself. \nANAKIN looks deep into PADME'S eyes. \nPADM\u00c9 Please don't look at me like that. \nANAKIN Why not? \nPADM\u00c9 Because I can see what you're thinking. \nANAKIN (laughing) Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers too? \nDORME is watching with concern. \nPADM\u00c9 It makes me feel uncomfortable. \nANAKIN Sorry, M'lady. \nANAKIN backs away as PADME turns and goes back to her packing. \nEXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant's Industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of starships. The bus stops before a huge intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an overhang. \nINT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY ANAKIN and PADME, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and head for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME and OBI-WAN are waiting to hand them their luggage. DORME is dressed to look like Senator Amidala. \nCAPTAIN TYPHO Be safe, m'lady. \nPADM\u00c9 Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme... the threat's on you two now. \nDORME He'll be safe with me. \nThey laugh, and PADME embraces her faithful handmaiden. DORME start to weep. \nPADM\u00c9 You'll be fine. \nDORME It's not me, M'Lady. I worry about you. What if they realise I'm not you? \nPADM\u00c9 (looks to Anakin) Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is. \nDORME and PADME smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him aside. \nOBI-WAN Anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council. \nANAKIN Yes, Master. \nOBI-WAN (to Padme) I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be back here in no time. \nPADM\u00c9 I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi. \nANAKIN Time to go. \nPADM\u00c9 I know. \nPADME gives DORME a last hug. ANAKIN picks up the luggage, and the TWO PEASANTS exit the speeder bus, where ARTOO is waiting for them. \nPADM\u00c9 We went into lightspeed a while ago. \nANAKIN looks into PADME'S eyes. \nANAKIN I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever seen... \nPADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare. \nPADM\u00c9 You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception. \nANAKIN I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception. \nPADM\u00c9 It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like... \nANAKIN Or be with the people I love. \nPADM\u00c9 Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi. \nANAKIN Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love. \nPADM\u00c9 You have changed so much \nANAKIN You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either. \nPADM\u00c9 It hasn't... \nANAKIN I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force, those hills are what I see. \nANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this. \nANAKIN (continuing) I love Naboo. \nThere is an awkward moment. \nPADM\u00c9 (changing the subject) Were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you? \nANAKIN Yes... I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don't want to lose it. Recently I've been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. I worry about her. \nPADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look. \nEXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET - MORNING OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional \"shiny freighters\" hissing through. \nOBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windowa it says \"DEX'S DINER\" in alien lettering. He goes inside. \nINT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNING A young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating - TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER DRIVERS etc. HERMIONE looks up as OBI-WAN comes in. \nHERMIONE Can I help ya? \nOBI-WAN I'm looking for Dexter. \nHERMIONE'S eyes narrow. \nHERMIONE BAGWA Waddya want him for? \nOBI-WAN He's not in trouble. It's personal. \nHERMIONE stares at OBI-WAN. There is a brief pause. Then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter. \nHERMIONE BAGWA Someone to see ya, honey (lowering her voice) A Jedi, by the looks of him. \nSteam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through. \nDEXTER JETTSTER Obi-Wan! \nOBI-WAN Hey, Dex. \nDEXTER JETTSTER Take a seat! Be right with ya! \nOBI-WAN sits in a booth. \nHERMIONE BAGWA You want a cup of ardees? \nPADM\u00c9 I think so too. \nANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow. \nINT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON QUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors. \nQUEEN JAMILLIA We've been worried about you. (takes her hand) I'm so glad you're safe, Padm\u00e9. \nPADM\u00c9 Thank you, Your Highness. I only Wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote. \nSIO BIBBLE Given the circumstances, Senator, you know it was the only decision Her Highness could have made. \nQUEEN JAMILLIA How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists? \nPADM\u00c9 About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war. \nSIO BIBBLE It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic! \nQUEEN JAMILLIA Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic? \nPADM\u00c9 Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help. \nQUEEN JAMILLIA The armies of commerce! Why has Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them? \nPADM\u00c9 I'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds. \nSIO BIBBLE It's outrageous! After all of those hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything? \nQUEEN JAMILLIA Remember, Counsellor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies. That's a move in the right direction. \nPADM\u00c9 There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered. \nANAKIN The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told. \nQUEEN JAMILLIA We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it. \nPADM\u00c9 Let's pray that day never comes. \nQUEEN JAMILLIA In the meantime, we must consider your own safety. \nSIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room. \nSIO BIBBLE (to Anakin) What is your suggestion, Master Jedi? \nPADM\u00c9 Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking... \nANAKIN (nettled) Hey, hold on a minute! \nPADM\u00c9 Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated. \nANAKIN Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady. \nSIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here. \nPADM\u00c9 Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance. \nANAKIN (takes a deep breath) Sorry, M'Lady. \nSIO BIBBLE (to Anakin, amused) She is right. The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain. \nQUEEN JAMILLIA Perfect. It's settled then. \nANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave. \nQUEEN JAMILLIA (continued) Padm\u00e9, I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave... your family's very worried about you. \nPADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase. \nEXT. JEDI TEMPLE - DAY The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going. \nINT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face. \nPADME (continuing) What? Don't say you're shy! \nANAKIN (untruthfully) No, but I... \nSuddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO (age 6) and POOJA (age 4). They come running toward PADME. \nRYOO & POOJA Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!! \nPADME Ryoo!! Pooja!! \nPADME scoops up RYOO and POOJA and hugs them. \nPADME (continuing) I'm so happy to see you! This is Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja. \nANAKIN and the GIRLS say hello shyly. Then: \nRYOO & POOJA Artoo!!! \nAs they see the droid, they hug him. ARTOO WHISTLES and BEEPS. PADME laughs. ANAKIN and PADME go on toward the house. The GIRLS stay and play with ARTOO. \nINT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON SOLA, PADME'S beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food. \nSOLA (over her shoulder) They're eating over at Jev Narran's later, Mom. They just had a snack. They'll be fine. \nSOLA puts the bowl down on the table, where ANAKIN, PADME and RUWEE NABERRIE (Padme's father) are coming into the room. \nPADME Anakin, this is my sister, Sola. \nSOLA Hello, Anakin. \nANAKIN Hello. \nSOLA sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padme's mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food. \nJOBAL You're just in time for dinner. I hope you're hungry, Anakin. \nANAKIN A little. \nPADME He's being polite, Mom. We're starving. \nRUWEE (grinning) You came to the right place at the right time. Sit down, son. \nEVERYONE sits and starts passing food. \nJOBAL (to Padme) Honey, it's so good to see you safe. We were so worried. \nPADME gives JOBAL a dirty look. RUWEE smiles as he watches. \nRUWEE Dear... \nJOBAL I know, I know... but I had to say it. Now it's done. \nSOLA Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin, you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought home? \nPADME (rolls her eyes) Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me. \nJOVAL A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They didn't tell us it was that serious! \nPADME It's not, Mom, I promise. (glances at Jobal) Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis? \nThey nod. \nPADME (continuing) He grew up. \nJOBAL Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven't you had enough of that life? I certainly have! \nPADME Mom, I'm not in any danger. \nRUWEE (to Anakin) Is she? \nANAKIN ...Yes... I'm afraid she is. \nShe looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause. \nANAKIN May I tell you something? \nPADME I don't know. \nANAKIN Then how can I tell you? \nPADME Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition. \nANAKIN It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you. \nPADME Anakin, don't... \nANAKIN From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask... \nSilence. The logs flame in the hearth. \nANAKIN (continuing) If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me. \nPADME ...I can't. We can't. It's just not possible. \nANAKIN Anything's possible. Padme, please listen... \nPADME You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other. \nANAKIN Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that. \nPADME Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me. \nANAKIN I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't. \nPADME I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love. \nThere is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking. \nANAKIN It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret. \nPADME Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that? \nSilence for a moment. \nANAKIN ...No, you're right. It would destroy us. \nEXT. SPACE It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet. \nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world. \nThe Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through the bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE A Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face. \nTAUN WE Welcome to Tipoca City, Master Jedi. \nOBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond shaped eyes. \nTAUN WE Everything is ready. The Prime Minister expects you. \nOBI-WAN (warily) I'm expected? \nTAUN WE Of course! He is anxious to see you. After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now please, this way! \nOBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor. \nObi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY The door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light. \nTAUN WE May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino... and this is Master Jedi... \nOBI-WAN Obi-Wan Kenobi. \nANAKIN Well, if it works... \nPADME stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile. \nPADM\u00c9 You're making fun of me. \nANAKIN (sarcastic) On no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator. \nPADM\u00c9 You're so bad! \nPADME picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them. \nANAKIN You're always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders. \nANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh. \nANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK. \nThe SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away. \nANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away. \nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY OBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF STORMTROOPERS, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred. \nLAMA SU (beaming) Magnificent, aren't they? \nOBI-WAN nods slowly. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMINSSARY - DAY LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE follows as they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black. They are seated at tables, eating. \nLAMA SU We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question. \nOBI-WAM Who was the original host? \nLAMA SU A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand- picked Jango Fett himself. \nOBI-WAN Where is this bounty hunter now? \nLAMA SU Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he's free to come and go as he pleases. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY The tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube, the CLONE goes to sleep. \nLAMA SU Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious isn't it? \nOBI-WAN Unaltered? \nLAMA SU Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration... \nOBI-WAN I would like to meet this Jango Fett. \nTAUN WE I would be most happy to arrange it, for you. \nTAUN WE bows, and leaves. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM - DAY The tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY CLONES. \nOBI-WAN You mentioned growth acceleration... \nLAMA SU Oh yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time. Those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago, when Sido-dyas first placed the order, and they're already mature... \nOBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES. \nOBI-WAN And these? \nLAMA SU About five years ago. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY - DAY They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended. \nLAMA SU They're immensely superior to droids, capable of independent thought and action. \nOBI-WAN Very impressive. \nANAKIN'S opens his eyes and looks at her. \nANAKIN I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering, Padme. She is in pain...They're killing her! (getting up) I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a choice. \nPADME Annie, I told you I wouldn't let you give up your future for me. I'll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won't be disobeying your mandate. \nANAKIN What about Master Obi-wan? \nPADME smiles and takes his hand. \nPADME I guess we won't tell him, will we? \nEXT. NABOO LAKE, FLOATING LANDING PLATFORM - DAY ANAKIN and PADME step onto the landing platform from the water speeder. They enter the Naboo Starship. ARTOO BEEPS, and follows them on board. The ramp retracts. \nPADDY ACCU drives the water speeder away from the platform as Anakin's Starship takes off. \nEXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY Rain lashes the city. Below, mightly waves pound the stilts, breaking almost to the height of the platforms. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY TAUN WE conducts OBI-WAN to the door of Jango Fett's apartment. TAUN WE waves his hand, and a muted bell RINGS. \nAs they wait, OBI-WAN notes the door lock entry mechanism. Then the door opens, and a ten-year-old boy, BOBA FETT, looks at them. He is identical to the boys in the classroom. \nTAUN WE Boba, is your father here? \nThere is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods. \nTAUN WE (continuing) May we see him? \nBOBA FETT Sure. \nAnother brief pause, then BOBA FETT steps aside, and TAUN WE and OBI-WAN go through. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY OBI-WAN, TAUN WE, and BOBA FETT enter the apartment. OBI-WAN looks around the room. \nBOBA FETT Dad! Taun We's here! \nJANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion. \nTAUN WE Welcome back, Jango. Was your trip productive? \nJANGO FETT Fairly. \nOBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies both of them. \nTAUN WE This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He's come to check on our progress. \nJANGO FETT That right? \nJANGO FETT'S eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly. \nOBI-WAN Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud. \nJANGO FETT I'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe, Master Jedi. \nOBI-WAN Aren't we all? \nOBI-WAN eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. JANGO FETT registers OBI-WAN'S look. He moves in front of him, blocking the view. \nOBI-WAN (continuing) Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant? \nJANGO Once or twice. \nOBI-WAN Recently? \nJANGO (eyes Obi-Wan carefully) Possibly... \nOBI-WAN Then you must know Master Sido- Dyas? \nJANGO Boba, close the door. \nBOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at OBI-WAN. \nWATTO Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine no more. I sold her. \nANAKIN Sold her... \nWATTO Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you know, business is business. Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. Least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her. Can ya beat that? \nANAKIN Do you know where they are? \nWATTO Long way from here... someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think... \nANAKIN I'd like to know. \nANAKIN'S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly. \nWATTO Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's go look in my records. \nANAKIN and WATTO go into the shop. \nEXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY The waves crash against the water city as the storm continues. Light suddenlyt streams from the base of a landing platform as a door slides open. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY OBI-WAN stands with LAMA SU and TAUN WE just inside the open door. \nLAMA SU Tell your Council the first battalions are ready. And remind them that if they need more troops, we will need time to grow them. \nOBI-WAN I won't forget. \nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY OBI-WAN comes out from the tower into the driving ran. The door closes behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale. \nBelow, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone. \nOBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter. \nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to swing it, when: \nBOBA FETT Dad!! \nJANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on. \nJANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT. \nThe bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi. \nJANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour. \nIN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN. \nOUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting. \nIN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN. \nOUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as: \nIN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires. \nOUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand. \nThe lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand. \nIN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as: \nOUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface. \nJANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform. \nOBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge. \nLocked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts. \nANAKIN To find my mother. \nPADME No, Annie! \nCLIEGG She's daed, son. Accept it. \nANAKIN I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she's alive. \nANAKIN turns abruptly. \nEXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADME comes running out of the homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to PADME. \nANAKIN You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padme. You'll be safe. \nOWEN Take my speeder bike. \nPADME Anakin... \nPADME hugs him. ANAKIN walks over to Owen's speeder bike, which is standing close by. \nANAKIN I trust you'll watch over her, Owen. \nOWEN Don't worry. \nANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires. \nANAKIN I won't be long. \nANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADME watches him go. \nEXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS The red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that form rings. Jango Fett's ship appears, heading toward it. \nINT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS JANGO FETT grins at BOBA FETT. \nJANGO FETT Nearly there, son. \nJANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly: \nBOBA FETT Dad, look!! \nOn the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN. \nJANGO FETT Hang on! \nThe ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT. \nEXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan's fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through. \nFinally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids. \nIn JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very close by. \nBOBA FETT Dad! Watch out! \nJANGO FETT Stay calm, son. We'll be fine. That Jedi won't be able to follow us through this. \nBut Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them. \nIN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid. \nIN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid. \nBOBA FETT Got him! Yeahhhhh! \nJANGO FETT We won't see him again. \nBOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis. \nEXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP - SUNSET ANAKIN stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them from directions. The JAWAS confer exicitedly, then the CHIEF JAWA points in a particular direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds off to where the JAWA pointed. \nEXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE - TWILIGHT ANAKIN rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the distance. \nEXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) - NIGHT ANAKIN pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the huts at the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN GUARDS outside it. \nEXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) - NIGHT ANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut, flattening himself against the wall,s overhearing snatches of Tusken conversation from inside, using the shadows to him him until he arrives at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the black. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall. \nINT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHT The lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere. \nA shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut. \nHe cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly. \nANAKIN Mom... Mom... Mom... \nSHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open. They are caked with blood. \nSHMI Annie...? Is it you? \nSHMI'S eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp. \nANAKIN I\u0092m here, Mom. You\u0092re safe. Hang on. I\u0092m going to get you out of here... \nSHMI I\u0092m so glad... to see you, Annie... Now... I am complete... \nANAKIN Just stay with me, Mom. I\u0092m going to make you well again. Everything\u0092s going to be fine. \nSHMI You look so handsome. My son... my grown-up son. I\u0092m so proud of you, Annie... so proud... I missed you so much... I love... \nSHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms. \nEXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT OBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stop, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly. \nOBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below. \nSLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships. \nEXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground. \nAs she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakin\u0092s lightsaber switches on. \nEXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT OBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit. He settles into his seat. His ARFOUR DROID beeps a happy greeting. OBI-WAN switches on his comlink. \nOBI-WAN \"Guiding light\" to \"old folks home.\" \nEXT. CORUSCANT, REPUBLIC EXECUTIVE BUILDING - DAY LOW ANGLE. A line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome building. \nINT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE A hologram of OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi (YODA, MACE WINDU, and KI-ADI-MUNDI) and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, ASK AAK, LUMINARA, and JAR JAR). PALPATINE and MAS AMEDDA are in the middle of the group, watching with growing concern. \nOBI-WAN ...Starships from the Trade Federation and the Commerce Guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on Geonosis. \nBAIL ORGANA That's outrageous! The treaty forbids the Trade Federation from building up an army. What are they doing?! \nOBI-WAN The droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity. I am going to go down and investigate. I will bring Jango Fett back home for interrogation. \nPALPATINE Those Geonosian foundries are part of the Techno Union. We will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions. \nOBI-WAN One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be? \nYODA With the forename Darth, a Sith he must be. \nMACE WINDU Our missing apprentice. They are playing their hand at last. \nOBI-WAN Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the deal for the clone army? \nYODA Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are. \nMACE WINDU Be careful, Obi-Wan. This investigation is becoming less than routine. Do you need help? \nOBI-WAN Let me see if I can figure out what's going on first. \nThe hologram of OBI-WAN fades off. PALPATINE stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief. \nBAIL ORGANA The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war... there can be no doubt of that. \nThe GEONOSIANS part, and COUNT DOOKU appears. He bows courteously. \nCOUNT DOOKU Senator Amidala, I've heard so much about you. \nPADM\u00c9 Count Dooku, I assume. \nCOUNT DOOKU I'm delighted to meet you at last. We have a great deal to discuss, Senator. I hope you can keep your young Jedi under control. \nPADM\u00c9 Don't worry he's housebroken. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) - DAY COUNT DOOKU sits at a large conference table with PADME on the far side. ANAKIN stands behind her with FOUR GEONOSIANS GUARDS standing behind him. JANGO FETT stands behind COUNT DOOKU, and SIX GEONOSIAN GUARDS stand behind him. \nPADM\u00c9 You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi- Wan Kenobi. I am formally requesting you turn him over to me, now. \nDOOKU He has been convicted of espionage, Senator, and will be executed. In just a few hours, I believe. \nCOUNT DOOKU smiles. \nPADM\u00c9 He is an officer of the Republic. You can't do that. \nDOOKU We don't recognise the Republic here, Senator. But if Naboo were to join our Alliance, I could easily hear your plea for clemency. \nANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on. \nPADM\u00c9 And if I don't join your rebellion, I assume this Jedi with me will also die? \nDOOKU I don't wish to make you to join our cause against your will, Senator, but you are a rational, honest representative of your people and I assume you want to do what's in their best interest. Aren't you fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't you? Be honest, Senator. \nPADM\u00c9 The ideals are still alive, Count, even if the institution is failing. \nDOOKU You believe in the same ideals we believe in! The same ideals we are striving to make prominent. \nPADM\u00c9 If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right. \nDOOKU The Chancellor means well, M'Lady but he is incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no? Senator, the Republic cannot be fixed. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, a shell game played on the voters. It will not be long before the cult of greed, called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom. \nPADM\u00c9 I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it's business becoming government! \nDOOKU Are you willing to betray your Jedi friends? Without your co-operation I can do nothing to stop their execution. \nPADM\u00c9 What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also? \nDOOKU I wouldn't think of such an offence. But, there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise, M'lady. It has nothing to do with politics, I'm afraid. It's purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. I'm sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. I'm sorry but if you are not going to co-operate, I must turn you over to the Geonosians for justice. I've done all I can for you. \nJANGO FETT moves over to ANAKIN. \nJANGO FETT I'll take that weapon. \nANAKIN hesitates. \nDOOKU You may cause a lot of bloodshed, my young Jedi, but you will not escape. \nPADM\u00c9 Anakin... \nANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT. \nINT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY ANAKIN and PADME are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom. Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is POGGLE THE LESSER, Archduke of Geonosis. He is accompanied by his underling, SUN RIT. Off to one side the Separatist Senators PO NUDU, TESSEK, and TOONBUCK TOORA. Next to them are the Commerce Dignitaries, SHU MAI, NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along the wall about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a verdict. \nSUN RIT You have been charged and found guilty of Espionage. \nPOGGLE Do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out? \nPADM\u00c9 You are committing an act of war, Archduke. I hope you are prepared for the consequences. \nPOGGLE laughs. COUNT DOOKU simply smiles. \nPOGGLE We build weapons, Senator... that is our business! Of course we're prepared! \nNUTE GUNRAY Get on with it. Carry out the sentence. I want to see her suffer. \nPOGGLE Your other Jedi friend is waiting for you, Senator. Take them to the arena! \nIn the archducal box: \nNUTE GUNRAY Foul!! She can't do that... shoot her or something! \nIn the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK. \nANAKIN You okay? \nPADME (nods, gasping) Sure! Well, sort of. \nANAKIN Jump!!! \nThe NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS. \nIn the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU. \nNUTE GUNRAY This isn't how it's supposed to be! Jango, finish her off. \nCOUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle. \nCOUNT DOOKU (smiling enigmatically) Patiece, Viceroy... she will die. Maybe this is the way it's supposed to end. \nOBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them. \nINT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY ARTOO BEEPS \nC-3PO Yes, it has been rather a long time. Do you suppose something's happened to them? \nARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES. \nC-3PO (continuing) Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think so. It looks a very dull planet to me. They should be back shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo. \nEXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY In the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit. \nCOUNT DOOKU Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us. You're just in time for the moment of truth. I would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training. \nMACE WINDU Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku. This party's over. \nMACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement. \nCOUNT DOOKU (to Mace Windu) Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi friend. You're impossibly outnumbered. \nMACE WINDU I don't think so. One Jedi has to be worth a hundred Geonosians. \nCOUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows. \nCOUNT DOOKU It wasn't the Geonosians I was thinking about. How well do you think one Jedi will hold up against a thousand battle droids? \nCOUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena. \nMACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect. \nThe REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. \nAmong the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS. \nINT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP ARTOO whistles. \nC-3PO I don't hear anything. (Artoo beeps) You're scaring me! Stop imagining things! \nEXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY Among the tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed heaps of GEONOSIANS and have kncoked out piles of DROIDS, but sheer numbers are telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/ The rest are retreating into the arena. \nANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter's body falls to the ground. \nMACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS. \nOBI-WAN Someone's got to - shut down - these droids. \nMACE WINDU Don't worry! It's being - taken care of! \nEXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAY KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Battle Starships. They cut a swath through masses of DROIDS until they arrive at the Command Starship. Some JEDI fall. The rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship. \nANAKIN (continuing; to pilot) Put the ship down! Down! \nOBI-WAN No! Forget her. We have to go after Dooku. \nANAKIN No we're not!! Land this ship! \nOBI-WAN Don't let your personal feelings get in the way. We've got a job to do. \nBelow, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU. \nANAKIN I don't care!.. Go back. \nOBI-WAN Anakin! She's all right! Look. \nANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS. \nOBI-WAN (continuing) Follow that speeder! \nOn the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows. \nCount Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower. \nINT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open. \nDROID CAPTAIN Your Excellency! \nCOUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons. \nCOUNT DOOKU That won't be necessary, Captain. Stand down. And leave them to me. \nThe DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement. \nOBI-WAN (to Anakin) We move in together - you slowly on the... \nANAKIN I'm taking him now! \nOBI-WAN Anakin, no! \nANAKIN You'll pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku. \nANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN \nCOUNT DOOKU Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now, back down. \nOBI-WAN I don't think so. \nOBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles. \nCOUNT DOOKU Ah, but if I must. \nCOUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other. \nCOUNT DOOKU (continuing) I have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the Dark Side. It gives me infinitely greater power. \nOBI-WAN You will have to prove it. \nOBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style. \nCOUNT DOOKU Grand Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. Yoda holds you in such high esteem. \nCOUNT DOOKU parried another cut. \nCOUNT DOOKU (continuing) Surely you can do better...? (parries) No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me? (cuts) Which is it? \nCOUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath. \nCOUNT DOOKU (continuing) come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me out of my misery. \nOBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat. \nCOUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes. \n", "test1_input": "MACE WINDU Why couldn't we see this attack on the Senator? \nYODA Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force. \nMACE WINDU The propecy is coming true, the Dark Side is growing. \nYODA And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future. Only going through the Dark Side can we see. \nMACE WINDU It's been ten years, and the Sith still have no shown themselves. Do you think they are behind this? \nYODA ...Out there, they are. A certainty that is. \nMACE WINDU Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice will be able to bring balance to the Force? \nYODA Only if he chooses to follow his destiny. \nThere is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard. \nINT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT PADME is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off. \nINT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHT ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt. \nThe door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters. \nOBI-WAN Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here? \nANAKIN Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her. \nOBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed. \nOBI-WAN What's going on? \nANAKIN shrugs. \nANAKIN She covered that camera. I don't think she liked me watching her. \nOBI-WAN What is she thinking? \nANAKIN She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder. \nOBI-WAN It's not an intruder I'm worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator. \nANAKIN I know, but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we, Master? \nOBI-WAN You're using her as bait?? \nANAKIN It was her idea... No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me. \nOBI-WAN It's too risky... and your senses aren't that attuned, young apprentice. \nANAKIN And yours are? \nOBI-WAN Possibly. \nINT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT As PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window. \nARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME. \nINT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment. \nOBI-WAN You look tired. \nANAKIN I don't sleep well, anymore. \nOBI-WAN Because of your mother? \nANAKIN I don't know why I keep dreaming About her now. I haven't seen her since I was little. \nOBI-WAN Dreams pass in time. \nANAKIN I'd rather dream of Padm\u00e9. Just Being around her again is... intoxicating. \n", "test1_true": "ANAKIN She's not like the others in the Senate, Master. \nOBI-WAN It's been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds. \nANAKIN Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics.... It's too early in the morning... and besides, you're generalising. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt. \nOBI-WAN Palpatine's a politician, I've observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators. \nANAKIN I think he is a good man. My instincts are very positive about... \nANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WAN \nOBI-WAN I sense it, too. \nINT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out. \nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber. \nOBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window. \nEXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city. \nINT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT ANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders. \nANAKIN Stay here! \nCAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out. \nEXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off. \nEXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT ANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above. \nEXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN. \nOBI-WAN I have a bad feeling about this. \nFINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN. \nANAKIN That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic. \nOBI-WAN What took you so long? \nANAKIN Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color... \nThey zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol. \nOBI-WAN If you'd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman. \nANAKIN I thought I already did. \nOBI-WAN Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!! \nAs this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them. \nANAKIN Sorry, I forgot you don't like flying, Master. \nOBI-WAN I don't mind flying... but what you're doing is suicide! \nThey barely miss a commuter train \nANAKIN Master, you know I've been flying since before I could walk. I'm very good at this. \nOBI-WAN Just slow down! \nZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel. \nOBI-WAN (continuing) Wait! Don't go in there! \nANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport. \n", "test1_id": 2076, "test2_input": "INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - DAY OBI-WAN walks through the main hallway to the training area. \nINT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so FOUR-YEAR-OLDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them. \nYODA Don't think... feel... be as one with the Force. Help you, it will. (he sees Obi-Wan) Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him. \nThe CHILDREN take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers. \nYODA (continuing) Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan. \nCHILDREN Welcome, Master Obi-Wan! \nOBI-WAN I am sorry to disturb you, Master. \nYODA What help to you, can I be? \nOBI-WAN I\u0092m looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesn\u0092t show up on the archive maps. \nYODA An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will try... \nThe map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display. \nOBI-WAN This is where it ought to be... but it isn\u0092t. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isn\u0092t. \nYODA Most interesting. Gravity\u0092s silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be? \nThere is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods. \nJEDI CHILD JACK Because someone erased it from the archive memory. \nCHILDREN That\u0092s right! Yes! That\u0092s what happened! Someone erased it! \nJEDI CHILD MAY If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away. \nOBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles. \nYODA Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will. \nOBI-WAN But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? That\u0092s impossible, isn\u0092t it? \nYODA (frowning) Much harder to answer, that question is. \nEXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADME are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake. \nEXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON ANAKIN and PADME walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA, as they carry the bags into the Lodge. \nANAKIN and PADME stop at the balustrade. PADME looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN looks at her silently. \nPADM\u00c9 When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water. \nANAKIN I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet. \nPADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her. \nPADM\u00c9 ...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing. \nANAKIN I don\u0092t like sand. It\u0092s coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything\u0092s soft... and smooth... \nHe touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous. \nPADM\u00c9 There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical. \nANAKIN (looks into her eyes) Everything here is magical. \nPADM\u00c9 You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasn\u0092t. \nANAKIN Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway... \nThey look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin. \nPADM\u00c9 I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself. \n", "test2_true": "ANAKIN kisses PADME. She doesn't resist. She comes to her senses and pulls away. \nPADM\u00c9 I shouldn't have done that. \nANAKIN I'm sorry. When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own. \nPADM\u00c9 It's the situation... the stress... \nHe looks at her. \nANAKIN ...the view. \nEXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON Obi-Wan's Starfighter is ready for takeoff. OBI-WAN and MACE WINDU stand beside it. \nMACE WINDU Be wary, this disturbance in the Force is growing stronger. \nOBI-WAN I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own. \nYODA The Council is confident in this decision, Obi-Wan. \nMACE He has exceptional skills. The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, he weill be the one to bring balance to the Force. \nOBI-WAN But he still has much to learn. And his abilities have made him... well... arrogant. I realise now what you and Master Yoda knew from the beginning... the boy was too old to start the training and... \nOBI-WAN hesitates. \nMACE WINDU There's something else? \nOBI-WAN Master, he should not have been given this assignment. I'm afraid Anakin won't be able to protect the Senator. \nMACE WINDU Why? \nOBI-WAN He has a... an emotional connection with her. It's been there since he was boy. Now he's confused... distracted. \nMACE-WINDU Obi-Wan, you must have faith that he will take the right path. \nOBI-WAN climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter. \nOBI-WAN Has Master Yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about? \nMACE WINDU Probing the Dark Side is a dangerous process. He could be in seclusion for days... May the force be with you. \nINT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA'S QUARTERS - LATE AFTERNOON YODA sits with his eyes closed, meditating. Silence. \nEXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE, LATE AFTERNOON The setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the rose-tinted light. Floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge. \nINT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON NANDI place dessert in front of PADME. TECKLA does the same for ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADME picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again -the fruit moves. She lokk up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his plate. \nPADME You did that? \nANAKIN looks up - wide-eyed innocence. \nANAKIN What? \nPADME scowls at him. PADME jabs at the fruit - ANAKIN subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her. \nPADME That! Now stop it! \nPADME laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops. \nPADME (continuing) Anakin!! \nANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand. \nANAKIN I'm not really supposed to do that... for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be very grumpy. \nANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to PADME. She bites it out of the air and laughs. \nINT.

That is your priority. \nANAKIN Understood, Master. \nThe hologram switches off. PADME is looking at the readout on the ship's control panel. \nPADME They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away. \nPADME starts to hit buttons and flick switches. ANAKIN puts a hand over hers, stopping her. She stares at him. \nANAKIN If he's still alive. \nPADME Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He's your friend... your mentor... \nANAKIN ...He's like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here. \nPADME He gave you strict orders to protect me... \nPADME pulls her hand free and flicks more switches.

JAR JAR grips the edge of the podium. \nJAR JAR In response to the direct threat to the Republic from the Confederacy of Independent Systems, I propose that the Senate gives immediate emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor. \nUproar. JAR JAR looks a little sheepish. \nJAR JAR (continuing) Who can deny these are exceptional times? Exceptional times demand exceptional measures! Exceptional measures demand exceptional men! \nORN FREE TAA We won't support a dictator. \nSHOUTS of agreement. \nJAR JAR That is the sentiment every one of us agrees with! And when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has dawned once again, the power we now give to the Supreme Chancellor will be gladly, and swiftly returned. Out ancient liberties will be restored to us, burnished even more brightly than before! \nBrief silence, then a rolling wave of APPLAUSE. JAR JAR beams and bows. \nPALPATINE rises. \nPALPATINE It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling. I love democracy... I love the Republic. The fact that this crisis is demanding I be given absolute power to tule over you is evident. But I am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic process. The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has abated, I promise you. And all I ask in return is when my current term of office is over, you allow me to reture and live out my life in peace. \nMAS AMEDDA We shall proceed to the vote.

PADME is in the co-pilot's seat. She gets up. \nANAKIN Hey, where are you going? \nPADME To find Obi-Wan. \nANAKIN gets up and goes over to her. \nANAKIN No! You're not! \nHe grabs her arm. \nPADME Let go of me! \nANAKIN I'm not letting you go out there. It's too dangerous. \nPADM\u00c9 What?!? \nANAKIN It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going, and that's final! \nPADM\u00c9 Don't you give me orders, Annie! I'm a Senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me! You remember your place, young man. (standing up) Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It's up to you. \nPADME storms out of the cockpit of the Naboo Starfighter. ANAKIN stands scratching his head, then follows. \nARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES. \nC-3PO Yes, it is, Artoo. Most confusing. One moment they're generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of violent hostility. Even though I'm programmed to understand them, I doubt if I ever shall. \nARTOO WHISTLES a plaintive sigh. \nINT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS - DAY ANAKIN and PADME enter the stalagmite city. They stop, looking around in wonder at the emptiness. \nPADME (in a low voice) It's empty! \nThey start forward. As they pass, the surface of the pillars seems to pulse slowly and move. High above WINGED CREATURES grow from the pillars and detach themselves. \nINT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY ANAKIN and PADME cross the square, reaching the middle. They stop suddenly as FOUR GEONOSIANS grabs them. ANAKIN reaches for his lightsaber. \nPADME Wait! \nTWENTY WINGED GEONOSIANS carrying weapons alight on the flagstones in front of them. \n", "test3_id": 2078}

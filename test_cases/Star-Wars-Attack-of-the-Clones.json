{"test1_input": "MACE WINDU You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He wouldn't assassinate anyone, it is not in his character. \nKI-ADI-MUNDI He is a political idealist, not a murderer. \nYODA In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are. \nPALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city. \nPALPATINE Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end? \nPADM\u00c9 I don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it... \nAfter gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to Mace. \nPALPATINE Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces. \nBAIL ORGANA Do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times? \nPADM\u00c9 Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the... \nPALPATINE ...\"situation is that serious.\" No, but I do, Senator. \nPADM\u00c9 Chancellor, please! I don't want any more guards! \nPALPATINE I realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... Master Kenobi... \nPALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back. \nMACE WINDU That's possible. He has just returned from a Border dispute on Ansion. \nPALPATINE You must remember him, M'Lady... he watched over you during the blockade conflict. \nPADM\u00c9 This is not necessary, Chancellor. \nPALPATINE Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is unbearable. \nAMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave. \nMACE WINDU I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, M'Lady. \nYODA leans into her ear. \nYODA Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, Padm\u00e9. Accept our help. \nAs the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his desk. \nPALPATINE I will not like this Republiv, that has stood for over a thousand years, be split in two \nEXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - TWILIGHT A graceful skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant. \nINT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR - EVENING The door to the apartment slides open. JAR JAR walks into the corridor, where TWO JEDI are exiting the elevator. He recognises OBI-WAN and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his hand. \nJAR JAR Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo! \nOBI-WAN smiles. \nOBI-WAN It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar. \nJAR JAR Oops! Wheresa mesa manners? Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I completely forgot myself for a moment there. I have had to learn Diplodiaclect... speak it like a native now. Don't really see the point, actually, but members of the Senate seem to prefer it... \nJAR JAR notices OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE. \nJAR JAR (continuing) ...and this, I take it, is your apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie? Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie? (Looks at Anakin) Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen! Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no believen. \nANAKIN Hi, Jar Jar. \nJAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug. \nJAR JAR Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii! \nINT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT - EVENING PADME is in a conference with CAPTAIN TYPHO and DORME. JAR JAR enters the room, followed by the TWO JEDI. \n", "test1_true": "PADME and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the SENATOR. OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADME. She glances at him. \nOBI-WAN It's a great pleasure to see you again, M'Lady. \nPADM\u00c9 It has been far too long Master Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths have crossed again... but I must warn you that I think your presence here is unnecessary. \nOBI-WAN I'm sure the Jedi Council have their reasons. \nShe moves in front of ANAKIN \nPADM\u00c9 Annie?? (stares) My goodness you've grown. \nThey look at each other for a long moment. \nANAKIN (trying to be smooth) So have you... grown more beautiful, I mean... and much shorter... for a Senator, I mean. \nOBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADME laughs and shakes her head. \nPADM\u00c9 Oh Annie, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine. \nThis embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO smile. \nOBI-WAN Our presence will be invisible, M'Lady. \nCAPTAIN TYPHO I am very grateful you are here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit. \nPADM\u00c9 I don't need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me. \nOBI-WAN (frowning) We're here to protect you Senator, not to start an investigation. \nANAKIN We will find out who is trying to kill you Padm\u00e9, I promise you. \nHe's done it again. He bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a dirty look. \nOBI-WAN We are not going to exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner. \nANAKIN I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course. \nOBI-WAN We are not going through this exercise again, Anakin. You will pay attention to my lead. \nANAKIN Why? \nOBI-WAN What??!! \nANAKIN Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate. \nOBI-WAN We will do as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one. \nPADM\u00c9 Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed.  Now if you will excuse me I will retire. \nEveryone gives AMIDALA a slight bow as she and DORME leave the room. \nCAPTAIN TYPHO Well, I know I feel a lot better having you here. I'll have an officer on every floor and I'll be at the command centre downstairs. \nJAR JAR Mesa busten wit happiness seein Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad times, bombad times. \nCaptain Typho leaves. \nANAKIN She didn't even recognise me, Jar Jar. I thought about her every day since we parted... and she's forgotten me completely. \nJAR JAR Shesa happy. Happier den mesa see-en her in longo time. \nOBI-WAN Anakin, you're focusing on the Negative again. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was glad to see us.

Shmi... she's not mine no more. I sold her. \nANAKIN Sold her... \nWATTO Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you know, business is business. Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars.

Can ya beat that? \nANAKIN Do you know where they are? \nWATTO Long way from here... someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think... \nANAKIN I'd like to know. \nANAKIN'S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly. \nWATTO Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's go look in my records. \nANAKIN and WATTO go into the shop. \nEXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY The waves crash against the water city as the storm continues. Light suddenlyt streams from the base of a landing platform as a door slides open. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY OBI-WAN stands with LAMA SU and TAUN WE just inside the open door. \nLAMA SU Tell your Council the first battalions are ready. And remind them that if they need more troops, we will need time to grow them. \nOBI-WAN I won't forget. \nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY OBI-WAN comes out from the tower into the driving ran. The door closes behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale. \nBelow, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it. \nINT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone. \nOBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter. \nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to swing it, when: \nBOBA FETT Dad!! \nJANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on. \nJANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT. \nThe bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi. \nJANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour. \nIN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN. \nOUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting. \nIN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN. \nOUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as: \nIN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires. \nOUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand. \nThe lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand. \nIN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as: \nOUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface. \nJANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform. \nOBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge. \nLocked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts. \n", "test2_true": "JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR. \nOUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky.

A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold. \nEXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - LATE DAY The Naboo Starship descends, hovers, and land on a bluff. ANAKIN and PADME get out. They look down from the edge of the bluff to where the homestead is seen on the desert floor below. \nPADME Stay with the ship, Artoo. \nARTOO WHISTLES as ANAKIN and PADME start down the trail toward the homestead. \nEXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY C-3PO is working outside the homestead. He still lacks an outer covering; his inner parts and wiring show. He looks up as ANAKIN and PADME arrive, \nC-3PO Good evening. May I help you? \nANAKIN Threepio? \nC-3PO Oh, my... oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Padme. \nPADME Hello, Threepio. \nANAKIN I've come to see my mother. \nC-3PO Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry, Master Annie. \nPADME Threepio, what's happened? \nC-3PO I think we'd better go inside. \nEXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD - LATE DAY ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO arrive in the courtyard. THREEPIO shuffles ahead. \nC-3PO Master Lars - Master Owen! Somebody to see you! \nOWEN LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard. \nANAKIN I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here looking for my mother. \nOWEN Owen Lars... I guess I'm your step-brother. (they shake hands) This is my girlfriend, Beru. \nBERU Hello. \nPADME I'm Padme. \nOWEN I had a feeling you might show up some day. \nANAKIN Is my mother here? \nCLIEGG No, she's not. \nCLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand. \nCLIEGG (continuing) Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife... Come on inside. We have a lot to talk about. \nINT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN - LATE DAY BERU puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the kitchen... \nCLIEGG (O.S.) It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party of Tusekn Raiders. \nINT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - LATE DAY CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME and ANAKIN sit around the table, BERU brings the drinks from the kitchen. \nCLIEGG Your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporatos. From the tracks, she was about halfway when they took her. Those Tuskens walk like men, but they're vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. Three more are still out there looking. I'd be with them, only... I just couldn't ride any more... until I heal. \nCLIEGG grimaces, easing his throbbing leg. \nCLIEGG (continuing) This isn't the way I wanted to meet you, son. This isn't how your mother and I planned it. I don't want to give up on her, but she's been gone a month. There's little hope she's lasted this long. \nSilence. Then ANAKIN stands up. \nOWEN Where are you going? \n", "test2_id": 2077, "test3_input": "In the archducal box: \nNUTE GUNRAY Foul!! She can't do that... shoot her or something! \nIn the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK. \nANAKIN You okay? \nPADME (nods, gasping) Sure! Well, sort of. \nANAKIN Jump!!! \nThe NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS. \nIn the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU. \nNUTE GUNRAY This isn't how it's supposed to be! Jango, finish her off. \nCOUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle. \nCOUNT DOOKU (smiling enigmatically) Patiece, Viceroy... she will die. Maybe this is the way it's supposed to end. \nOBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them. \nINT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY ARTOO BEEPS \nC-3PO Yes, it has been rather a long time. Do you suppose something's happened to them? \nARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES. \nC-3PO (continuing) Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think so. It looks a very dull planet to me. They should be back shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo. \nEXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY In the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit. \nCOUNT DOOKU Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us. You're just in time for the moment of truth. I would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training. \nMACE WINDU Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku. This party's over. \nMACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement. \nCOUNT DOOKU (to Mace Windu) Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi friend. You're impossibly outnumbered. \nMACE WINDU I don't think so. One Jedi has to be worth a hundred Geonosians. \nCOUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows. \nCOUNT DOOKU It wasn't the Geonosians I was thinking about. How well do you think one Jedi will hold up against a thousand battle droids? \nCOUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena. \nMACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect. \nThe REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. \nAmong the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS. \nINT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP ARTOO whistles. \nC-3PO I don't hear anything. (Artoo beeps) You're scaring me! Stop imagining things! \nEXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY Among the tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed heaps of GEONOSIANS and have kncoked out piles of DROIDS, but sheer numbers are telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/ The rest are retreating into the arena. \nANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter's body falls to the ground. \nMACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS. \nOBI-WAN Someone's got to - shut down - these droids. \nMACE WINDU Don't worry! It's being - taken care of! \nEXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAY KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Battle Starships.

COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE - DAY THEY burst onto the bridge and chop down the COMMAND DROIDS. The NEIMOIDIANS flee in all directions. KE-ADI-MUNDI leans over the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE! \nThere is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back. \nPLO KOON We've done it! Now we have a chance! \nSuddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADI-MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay. \nKI-ADI-MUNDI The system's off but they're still active. That's a new feature. They are independent of the control system. \nEXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY MACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI. \nAt the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father's battered helmet. He picks it up. \nKI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly. \nIn the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI. \nCOUNT DOOKU Master Windu! \nSilence. \nCOUNT DOOKU (continuing) You have fought gallantly. Worthy of recognition in the history archives of the Jedi Order. Now it is finished. (pauses briefly) Surrender - and your lives will be spared. \nMACE WINDU We will not be hostages for you to barter with Dooku. \nCOUNT DOOKU Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You will have to be destroyed. \nThe DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADME clasps hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN. \nPADME Look! \nAbove, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships. \nYODA Come on - hurry! Hurry! \nThe SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim. \nEXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA - DAY The massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the DROIDS surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. Beyond, more Republic Starships are landing and spewing out troops. \nINT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE - DAY MACE WINDU stares at the incredible sight. \nYODA More battalions to the left. Encircle them we must, then divide. \nThe CLONE TROOPERS open fire with artillery. EXPLOSIONS wreck the parked Battle Starships. CLONE TROOPERS advance, firing at the massed DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships and JEDI fighters. \nINT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY THREEPIO and ARTOO see flashes outside of the ship, exploding everywhere. \nC-3PO I'm sure I heard something, this time. Didn't you? It's probably just a celebration \nARTOO lets out an EXHAUSTED BLEEP. \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE - DAY Gunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids. \nINT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below. \nThe Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently. \nOBI-WAN Hold on! Look over there... \nThrough the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU. \nANAKIN It's Dooku, go after him! \nThe PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out. \nANAKIN (continuing) Padme!!! \nANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below. \n", "test3_id": 2078}

JEREMY (CONT'D) So what are you up to? 
SAM Trying to get money... not very successfully. 
JEREMY I've gotta pick up some cash too. Need some supplies for the lab. I don't think I've even slept since I got my hands on that meteorite. You should come by the lab with me and check it out. 
SAM I can't... 
Sam starts to walk away from him. 
JEREMY I could let you borrow some money... if you need some. 
SAM I don't even know you. 
JEREMY That's okay. I trust you. 
SAM Thanks anyway. 
JEREMY You're sure you don't want to check out the lab? 
SAM Sorry... I've gotta find Corey. 
Sam turns to leave. 
JEREMY Maybe some other time. 
I/E. RANDY'S CAR - AFTERNOON 
Corey rides shotgun in Randy's car, chewing on some greasy FAST FOOD, looking quite content. Randy is behind the wheel with a BEER in his hand, and Mike, Jeff and Ruth are packed into the back, passing around a JOINT. 
MIKE How many cheeseburgers did we get? 
RUTH Like eight. 
Mike passes the joint up to Corey and she takes a big hit, chases it with some beer... 
JEFF Wait, did we get smokes? 
Everyone in the car is stunned into momentary silence when they turn a corner and see what's left of the church. 
MIKE                            RANDY Whoa!                           Jesus Christ... 
POV FROM THE CAR - THE CHURCH RUINS 
POLICE and FIREMEN swarm. Father Homeijer stands with Officer O'Dell, gazing at the soggy ruins. The only things standing amid the charred mess are the THREE BARE CROSSES of Mount Calvary. But they aren't completely intact -- 
EXT. CHURCH RUINS - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - DEFORMED CROSSES 
All three are bent drastically forward, sagging down toward the murky ground... 
OFFICER O'DELL (O.S.) Musta' melted from the heat. 
Father Homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis, beside himself with bitterness and sorrow. 
FATHER HOMEIJER They're made of silver-plated steel. A simple fire couldn't do that. 
OFFICER O'DELL What are you sayin'? 
FATHER HOMEIJER This is an extension of Satan's own hand... I've seen it coming. 
Rolling his eyes, O'Dell walks away, leaving the priest to grieve for his church in private. 
EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON 
Vietnam Tom continues to toil over his SCULPTURE, but progress has been made... 
It has begun to take on a recognizable form: a GROTESQUE COUNTENANCE with TWO LONG EARS, BULGING EYES and a devilish, TOOTHY GRIN... 
EXT. RANDY'S CAR/STREET IN FRONT OF DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON 
Sam is walking in front of a DEPARTMENT STORE when Randy's car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the passenger side window. 
COREY What happened to you? 
SAM What happened to me...? Where the hell've you been? 
COREY I crashed at Randy's. We just got food. Want a burger? 
SAM My stomach's fucked up. 
JEFF                             MIKE Awww...                         Poor tummy... 
Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers. 
SAM (CONT'D) We gotta talk about what we're gonna do.

Alex appears unaware as he simply runs past Billy, who curiously turns his head to watch Alex race up the street. O.S., the CRACKLING OF FIRE. CAMERA MOVES INTO Billy as he turns back, reacting with shock to Ms. Lewton's house. 
THE HOUSE 
from inside, an intense EXPLOSION propels glass from the windows. Flames engulf the entire house. 
ALEX 
even down the street, he is knocked to his feet by the blast. In the distance, SIRENS from approaching POLICE AND FIRE trucks are HEARD. He stands, looks to the now suspicious Billy... then opts to run off away from the scene. Escaping into the dark backyards of the neighborhood. 
CUT TO: 
INT./EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVERS' HOUSE - DAY - CLEAR RIVERS 
Tense, her eyes look left, then right... 
CLEAR I don't know where he is. He's not talking to me. 
WIDER 
Agents Schreck and Weine stand before Clear in her garage. 
WEINE Why? 
She studies the men before averting her eyes. 
CLEAR Because I didn't believe him. 
The agents study her. Weine accepts the explanation. Schreck's eyes take a walk around the artwork in the garage, pausing on a piece of twisted metal from the crash. Clear tenses, however... 
SCHRECK If he should contact you, it would be in the best interest of your own safety to contact us. 
Schreck hands his card. She takes it and nods. Schreck pauses, once again eyeing the painting before moving out of the garage on their way to their car. 
CAMERA PUSHES IN ON CLEAR as she looks at the business card. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MT. ABRAHAM HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT 
CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Flight 180 Memorial, lit for dramatic effect at night, but only achieving an eeriness. Carter Horton and Billy Hitchcock ENTER FRAME, moving toward the monument. Billy is riding his bicycle, wearing a New York Rangers jersey with "Hitchcock" across the back of the shoulders. Nearing the shadows, the two boys stop looking at the monument. 
Carter pulls put a heavy pocket knife and starts attempting to cut into the stone. 
Clear Rivers appears from the shadows. 
CLEAR What are you doing? 
CARTER Terry's name should be on this wall. 
Clear is touched by the action. 
CARTER (CONT'D) So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now? 
CLEAR They're watching me, see if I go to Alex. 
BILLY Are you? 
CLEAR They'll follow my car. (beat) That's why you're taking me. 
CARTER Why would I want to see him? 
Clear eyes the two of them. With the memorial standing behind them... 
CLEAR Because he knows which one of us is next. 
As Carter and Billy feel the chill of their inner fears... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
The muscle car ROARS onto U.S. 17 on ramp. A sign near the road indicates: "Middletown - 25 mi. New York City - 105 mi." 
INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT 
Carter checks the rearview mirror. Clear looks out the front passenger window. She shakes her head, as if "no one's following us." Billy leans forward from the backseat... 
BILLY Um... okay... drive the speed limit, right? 
He sits back, OUT OF FRAME, but quickly darts forward. 
BILLY (CONT'D) And don't pass on the right. 
CARTER Billy! I'm gettin' a vision! You're the next one... BILLY (nervous) Hey, man, why'd you say that?! 
CARTER 'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya! 
Billy sits back, gesturing, "hear ya. Got it." Clear pays no attention to their exchange as she stare out into the darkness, her thoughts a million miles away. 
EXT. SEASHORE - JONES BEACH SATE PARK - NIGHT 
A posted sign indicates "ACCIDENT SITE. ANY DEBRIS FOUND SHOULD BE REPORTED TO THE NTSB (212)555-NTSB." CAMERA FINDS Carter's car pulling up to a stop. Clear opens the passenger door and pauses in the car a while... 
CLEAR He could be anywhere from here to a mile down the shore. You guys drive down there, start this way and we'll meet around the middle. It'll take half the time. Clear closes the door. Carter and Billy drive off. As she looks to the beach.

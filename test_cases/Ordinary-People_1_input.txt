Golf ball being wished out of sight by a club. Beth, Calvin, Ward (Beth's brother) and his wife Audrey, are having drinks sitting at a table on a golf course under a parasol. 
WARD lifts his golf club and demonstrates a clumsy hesitating swing, and how it misses. 
WARD Watch this. Pessimistic golfer. Pessimistic golfer. 
Ward arms his club as if to strike, then stops. 
WARD (cont'd) Oh. Damn! 
They laugh. 
WARD (cont'd) Are we two up? Two? 
GOLF PLAYER (OS) Two! 
WARD All right. Let's hustle up. We're close here. 
CALVIN I'll never get over how flat it is here. I'll never get over...

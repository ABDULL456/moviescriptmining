{"train": "ROB You're crazy! \nALVY No, I'm not.  We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, \"Jew.\" \nROB Alvy, you're a total paranoid. \nALVY Wh- How am I a paran-?  Well, I pick up on those kind o' things.  You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said ... uh, \"Did you eat yet or what?\" and Tom Christie said, \"No, didchoo?\" Not, did you, didchoo eat?  Jew?  No, not did you eat, but Jew eat?  Jew.  You get it? Jew eat? \nROB Ah, Max, you, uh ... \nALVY Stop calling me Max. \nROB Why, Max?  It's a good name for you.  Max, you see conspiracies in everything. \nALVY No, I don't!  You know, I was in a record store.  Listen to this -so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, \"Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner.\" Wagner, Max, Wagner-so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner. \nROB Right, Max.  California, Max. \nALVY Ah. \nROB Let's get the hell outta this crazy city. \nALVY Forget it, Max. \nROB -we move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max. \nALVY No, I cannot.  You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light. \nROB (Checking his watch) Right, Max, forget it.  Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie? \nALVY I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left.  Right? \nEXT. BEEKMAN THEATER-DAY \nAlvy stands in front of glass doors of theater, the ticket taker behind him just inside the glass doors.  The sounds of city traffic, car horns honking, can be heard while he looks around waiting for, Annie. A man in a black leather jacket, walking past the theater, stops in front of, Alvy.  He looks at him, then moves away.  He stops a few steps farther and turns around to look at Alvy again.  Alvy looks away, then back at the man.  The man continues to stare. Alvy scratches his head, looking for Annie and trying not to notice the man. The man, still staring, walks back to Alvy. \n1ST MAN Hey, you on television? \nALVY (Nodding his head) No. Yeah, once in a while.  You know, like occasionally. \n1ST MAN What's your name? \nALVY (Clearing his throat) You wouldn't know it.  It doesn't matter. What's the difference? \n1ST MAN You were on ... uh, the ... uh, the Johnny Carson, right? \nALVY Once in a while, you know.  I mean, you know, every now- \n1ST MAN What's your name? \nAlvy  is getting more and more uneasy as the man talks; more and more people move through the doors of the theater. \nALVY (Nervously) I'm ... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford. \n1ST MAN (Laughing) Come on. \nALVY Alvy Singer. It was nice nice ... Thanks very much ... for everything. \nThey shake hands and Alvy pats the man's arm.  The man in turn looks over his shoulder and motions to another man. All excited now, he points to Alvy and calls out. Alvy looks impatient. \n1ST MAN Hey! \n2ND MAN (Off screen) What? \n1ST MAN This is Alvy Singer! \nALVY Fellas ... you know-Jesus!  Come on! \n1ST MAN (Overlapping, ignoring Alvy) This guy's on television!  Alvy Singer, right?  Am I right? \nALVY (Overlapping 1st man) Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ! \n1ST MAN (Still ignoring Alvy's protestations) This guy's on television. \nALVY I need a large polo mallet! \n2ND MAN (Moving into the screen) Who's on television? \n1ST MAN This guy, on the Johnny Carson show. \nALVY (Annoyed) Fellas, what is this-a meeting o' the teamsters?  You know.. . \n2ND MAN (Also ignoring Alvy) What program? \n1ST MAN (Holding out a matchbook) Can I have your autograph? \nALVY'S VOICE (Off screen, laughing) Oh, I can imagine.  P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut. \nANNIE'S VOICE Then there was Jerry, the actor. \nCUT TO: \nFLASHBACK OF BRICK-WALLED APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe younger, Annie and Jerry lean against the wall. Jerry is running his band down Annie's bare arm. Annie and Alvy walk into the room, observing the younger Annie, in jeans and T-shirt, with Jerry. \nALVY'S VOICE (Laughing) Look at you, you-you,-re such a clown. \nANNIE'S VOICE I look pretty. \nALVY'S VOICE Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you ... \nJERRY Acting is like an exploration of the soul. I-it's very religious.  Uh, like, uh, a kind of liberating consciousness.  It's like a visual poem. \nALVY (Laughing) Is he kidding with that crap? \nYOUNGER ANNIE (Laughing) Oh, right.  Right, yeah, I think I know exactly what you mean, when you say \"religious.\" \nALVY (Incredulous, to Annie) You do? \nANNIE (Still watching) Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger. \nALVY Hey, that was last year. \nJERRY It's like when I think of dying.  You know how I would like to die? \nYOUNGER ANNIE No, how? \nJERRY I'd like to get torn apart by wild animals. \nALVY'S VOICE Heavy!  Eaten by some squirrels. \nANNIE'S VOICE Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat-looking and he was emotional ... Y-hey, I don't think you like emotion too much. \nJerry stops rubbing the younger Annie's arm and slides down to the floor as she raises her foot toward his chest. \nJERRY Touch my heart ... with your foot. \nALVY'S VOICE I-I may throw up! \nCUT BACK TO: \nEXTERIOR.  BEACH-DUSK \nIt's now sunset, the water reflecting the last light.  The camera moves over the scene.  The off screen voices of Alvy and Annie are heard as they walk, the camera always one step ahead of them. \nANNIE He was creepy. \nALVY Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along. \nANNIE (Laughing) Oh, really?  Well, la-de-da! \nALVY La-de-da.  If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like \"la-de-da\" . . . \nANNIE Oh, that's right.  That you really like those New York girls. \nALVY Well, no ... not just, not only. \nANNIE Oh, I'd say so.  You married- \nCUT TO: \nINT. NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT-NIGHT \nA cocktail party is in progress, the rooms crowded with guests as Alvy and Robin make their way through the people.  A waiter, carrying a tray, walks past them.  Alvy reaches out to pick up a glass; Robin reaches over and picks it of the tray first.  There is much low-key chatter in the background. \nANNIE (Off screen) -two of them. \nROBIN There's Henry Drucker.  He has a chair in history at Princeton.  Oh, the short man is Hershel Kaminsky.  He has a chair in philosophy at Cornell. \nALVY Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set. \nROBIN Why are you so hostile? \nALVY (Sighing) 'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television. \nROBIN (Squinting) Is that Paul Goodman?  No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book.  Hi, Doug!  Douglas Wyatt. \"A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of-the-Heart.\" \nThey move through the rooms, Robin holding a drink in one hand, her arm draped in Alvy's; the crowd mills around them. \nALVY (Taking Robin's hand) I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery. \nRob and Alvy, carrying tennis rackets, come through the door of the locker room to the lobby.  They are dressed in tennis whites.  They walk toward the indoor court. \nROB Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers- \nALVY Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism. \nROB Max, the city is terribly worried. \nALVY But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics.  This is foreskin. \nROB No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out.  Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism. \nALVY Don't you see?  The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here. \nROB Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun. \nALVY Sun is bad for yuh.  Everything our parents said was good is bad.  Sun, milk, red meat, college ... \nINT. TENNIS COURT \nAnnie and Janet, in tennis whites, stand on the court holding tennis rackets and balls.  They are chattering and giggling. \nANNIE (Laughing) I know, but ooh- here he comes.  Okay. \nRob and Alvy enter the court and walk over to the two women.  Rob kisses Janet and makes introduction. \nROB You know Alvy? \nJANET Oh, hi, Alvy. \nANNIE (To Rob) How are yuh? \nROB (To Alvy) You know Annie? \nJANET I'm sorry.  This is Annie Hall. \nALVY Hi. \nANNIE Hi. \nAnnie and Alvy shake hands. \nJANET (Laughing) Alvy. \nROB (Eager to begin) Who's playing who here?  Alvy Well, uh ... you and me against them? \nANNIE (Overlapping Alvy) Well ... so ... I can't play too good, you know. \nJANET (Laughing) I've had four lessons! \nThe group, laughing and chatting, divide up-Rob and Annie moving to the other side of the net, Alvy and Janet standing where they are.  They start to play mixed doubles, each taking turns and playing well. At one point in the game, Annie starts to talk to Rob, then turns and sees a ball heading toward her. \nALVY (Hitting the halt back) Holy gods! \nINT. LOBBY \nAlvy, dressed, puts things into a gym bag.  One knee is on the bench and his back is turned from the entrance. Annie walks toward the entrance door dressed in street clothes and carrying her tennis bag over her shoulder.  Seeing Alvy, she stops and turns. \nANNIE Hi.  Hi, hi. \nALVY (Looking over his shoulder) Hi.  Oh, hi.  Hi. \nANNIE (Hands clasped in front of her, smiling) Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door. \nALVY (Clearing his throat) You-you play ... very well. \nANNIE Oh, yeah?  So do you.  Oh, God, whatta- (Making sounds and laughing) whatta dumb thing to say, right?  I mean, you say it, \"You play well,\" and right away ... I have to say well.  Oh, oh ... God, Annie. (She gestures with her hand) Well ... oh, well ... la-de-da, la-de-da, la-la. \nShe turns around and moves toward the door. \nALVY (Still looking over his shoulder) Uh ... you-you wanna lift? \nANNIE (Turning and aiming her thumb over her shoulder) Oh, why-uh ... y-y-you gotta car? \nALVY No, um ... I was gonna take a cab. \nANNIE (Laughing) Oh, no, I have a car. \nALVY You have a car? (Annie smiles, hands folded in front of her) So ... (Clears his throat) I don't understand why ... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say \"Do you have a car?\"... like you wanted a lift? \nANNIE I don't ... (Laughing) I don't ... Geez, I don't know, I've ... I wa- This ... yeah, I got this VW out there ... (Laughing and gesturing toward the door) What a jerk, yeah.  Would you like a lift? \nALVY (Zipping up his bag) Sure.  W-w-w-which way yuh goin'? \nANNIE Me?  Oh, downtown! \nANNIE I live over here.  Oh, my God!  Look! There's a parking space! \nWith brakes squealing, Annie turns the VW sharply into the parking spot. Annie and Alvy get out, Alvy looking over his shoulder as he leaves the car. \nALVY That's okay, you ... we-we can walk to the curb from here. \nANNIE Don't be funny. \nALVY You want your tennis stuff? \nANNIE Huh?  Oh ... yeah. \nALVY You want your gear?  Here you go. \nAlvy reaches into the back of the car and takes out tennis equipment.  He hands her her things.  People pass by on the street. \nANNIE (Laughing) Yeah, thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Well... \nALVY (Sighing) Well, thanks, thank you.  You-you're a wonderful tennis player. \nANNIE (Laughing) Oh. \nAlvy shakes hands with Annie. \nALVY You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life . . . that's including any place ... the worst ... Europe, United ... any place ... Asia. \nANNIE (Laughing) Yeah. \nALVY And I love what you're wearin'. \nAlvy touches the tie Annie is wearing around her neck. \nANNIE Oh, you do?  Yeah?  Oh, well, it's uh ... this is, uh ... this tie is a present, from Grammy Hall. \nAnnie flips the bottom of the tie. \nALVY Who?  Grammy?  Grammy Hall? \nANNIE (Laughing and nodding her head) Yeah, my grammy. \nALVY You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting? \nANNIE (Laughing) Yeah, I know. \nALVY Your grammy! \nANNIE I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it? \nALVY Jesus, my-my grammy ... n-never gave gifts, you know.  She-she was\ttoo busy getting raped by Cossacks. \nANNIE (Laughing) Well ... \nALVY Well ... thank you again. \nANNIE Oh, yeah, yeah. \nALVY I'll see yuh. \nANNIE (Overlapping, gesturing) Hey, well, listen ... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh ... and have a glass of wine and something?  Aw, no, I mean ... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ... \nALVY No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure. \nANNIE You sure? \nALVY (Overlapping) No, I got time. \nANNIE Okay. \nALVY Sure, I got ... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment. \nThey move toward Annie's apartment building. \nANNIE Oh, you see an analyst? \nALVY Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years. \nANNIE Fifteen years? \nALVY Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes. \nANNIE Fifteen-aw, come on, you're . . . yeah, really? \nINT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT \nAlvy, standing, looks around the apartment.  There are lots of books, framed photographs on the white wall.  A terrace can be seen from the window.  He picks up a copy of Ariet, by Sylvia Platb, as Annie comes out of the kitchen carrying two glasses.  She hands them to Alvy. \nAgain, Annie's thoughts pop on: He probably thinks I'm a yo-yo \nALVY Photography's interesting, 'cause, you know, it's-it's a new art form, and a, uh, a set of aesthetic criteria have not emerged yet. \nAnd Alvy's: I wonder what she looks like naked? \nANNIE Aesthetic criteria?  You mean, whether it's, uh, good photo or not? \nI'm not smart enough for him.  Hang in there \nALVY The-the medium enters in as a condition of the art form itself.  That's- \nI don't know what I'm saying-she senses I'm shallow \nANNIE Well, well, I ... to me-I ... I mean, it's-it's-it's all instinctive, you know.  I mean, I just try to uh, feel it, you know?  I try to get a sense of it and not think about it so much. \nGod, I hope he doesn't turn out to be a shmuck like the others \nALVY Still, still we- You need a set of aesthetic guide lines to put it in social perspective, I think. \nChrist, I sound like FM radio.  Relax \nThey're quiet for a moment, holding wine glasses and sipping.  The sounds of distant traffic from the street can be heard on the terrace.  Annie, laughing, speaks first. \nANNIE Well, I don't know.  I mean, I guess-I guess you must be sorta late, huh? \nALVY You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon ... otherwise I- Hey ... well, are you busy Friday night? \nANNIE Me?  Oh, uh. (Laughing) No. \nALVY (Putting his band on his forehead) Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something.  Well, what about Saturday night? \nANNIE (Nodding) Oh ... nothing.  Not-no, no! \nALVY Oh, you ... you're very popular, I can see. \nANNIE (Laughing) I know. \nALVY Gee, boy, what do you have?  You have plague? \nANNIE Well, I mean, I meet a lot of ... jerks, you know- \nALVY Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too. \nANNIE (Overlapping) -what I mean? \nALVY I think that's, uh- \nANNIE (Interrupting) But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they ... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean (Laughing) oh, shoot!  No, Saturday night I'm gonna- (Laughing) gonna sing.  Yeah. \nALVY You're gonna sing?  Do you sing?  Well, no, it isn't (Overlapping) No kidding? (Overlapping) -this is my first time.  Oh, really?  Where? I'd like to come. (Laughing) Oh, no, no, no, no, no!  No, I'm interested! \nANNIE (Laughing) Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club.  I don't- \nALVY (Overlapping) No, so help me. \nANNIE (Overlapping) -it's my first time. \nALVY That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like.  Listen- \nANNIE (Interrupting) Yeah. \nALVY (Overlapping) -you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun. \nINT. NIGHT CLUB-NIGHT \nAnnie stands on center stage with a microphone, a pianist behind her.  A Bright light is focused on her; the rest of the club is in darkness.  There are the typical sounds and movements of a nightclub audience: low conversation, curling smoke, breaking glass, microphone bum, moving chairs, waiters clattering trays, a ringing phone as Annie sings \"It Had to Be You. \nEXT. CITY STREET-NIGHT. \nAlvy and Annie walk quickly down the sidewalk. \nANNIE I was awful.  I'm so ashamed!  I can't sing. \nALVY Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless. \nANNIE Whatta you mean, a tad restless?  Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me. \nALVY No, they didn't.  You have a wonderful voice. \nANNIE No, I'm gonna quit! \nALVY No, I'm not gonna letcha.  You have a great voice. \nANNIE Really, do you think so, really? \nANNIE (Overlapping) No. \nALVY No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing. \nANNIE (Laughing) Here, you want some? \nALVY No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and \nANNIE Yeah? \nALVY -tried to take my pants off over my head ... (Annie laughs) ...  my ear. \nANNIE Oh, I don't know, I don't really.  I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er ... relaxes me at first. \nALVY M'hm. (He pushes himself up from the bed and looks down at Annie) You're not gonna believe this, but- \nANNIE What?  What? \nCUT TO: \nINT. BOOKSTORE-DAY \nAnnie and Alvy browsing in crowded bookstore.  Alvy, carrying two books, \"Death and Western Thought\" and \"The Denial of Death\", moves over to where Annie is looking. \nALVY Hey? \nANNIE H'm? \nALVY I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them.  You know, instead of that cat book. \nANNIE (Looking at the books Alvy is bolding) That's, uh ... (Laughing) that's pretty serious stuff there. \nALVY Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think.  Big- \nANNIE (Overlapping) Yeah? \nALVY -big subject with me, yeah. \nANNIE Yeah? \nThey move over to the cashier line. \nALVY (Gesturing) I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable. \nANNIE M'hm. \nALVY Those are the two categories ... \nANNIE M'hm. \nALVY ... you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know? \nANNIE M'hm. \nALVY And blind people, crippled ... \nANNIE Yeah. \nALVY I don't-don't know how they get through life.  It's amazing to me. \nANNIE M'hm. \nALVY You know, and the miserable is everyone else.  That's-that's all.  So-so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky ... to be ... (Overlapping Annie's laughter) ... to be miserable. \nANNIE U-huh. \nEXT. PARK-DAY \nIt's a beautiful sunny day in Central Park.  People are sitting on benches, others strolling, some walking dogs.  One woman stands feeding cooing pigeons. Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard off screen as they observe the scene before them.  An older man and woman walk into view. \nALVY Look, look at that guy. \nANNIE M'hm. \nALVY There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know? (Over Annie's laughter) He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third. \nANNIE (Laughing) M'hm.  Yeah.  Yeah. \nThe camera shows them sitting side by side relaxed on a bench. \nALVY (Watching two men approach, one lighting a cigar) Look at these guys. \nANNIE Yeah. \nALVY Oh, that's hilarious.  They're back from Fire Island.  They're ... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean? \nANNIE Mine. \nALVY Ye-ah.  Was it ... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately. \nANNIE I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? (putting pictures on the mantel) ALVY No-what, what ...? I ... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together.  Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh? \nHe moves over to the carton of books on the window seat and reaches in.  He starts tossing books off screen. \nANNIE (Looking up at Alvy) How is it any different? \nALVY (Gesturing) It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment. (Holding a book, he starts walking around the room) Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft ... that we know that we're not married. \nHe tosses the book on the bed and walks back to the window seat. \nANNIE (Still sitting on the bed) That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy. \nALVY (Looking at Annie) That place is four hundred dollars a month? \nANNIE Yes, it is. \nALVY (Whistling) It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs.  Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it. \nANNIE (Shaking her head) You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about. \nALVY Hey, don't be ridiculous. \nAlvy moves over to the bed and sits down next to Annie. \nANNIE Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something? \nALVY (Putting his hand to his forehead) 'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating. \nEXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY \nAnnie and Alvy, in Annie's VW, driving to their summerhouse.  The camera moves with them as they pass a house with a lighted window, blooming foliage.  There is no dialogue, but it is a comfortable quiet.  Classical music plays in the background. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT \nAnnie, sitting cross-legged on a wooden chest in the bedroom, is browsing through a school catalogue.  Alvy lies in bed reading. \nANNIE (Reading) Does this sound like a good course? Uh, \"Modern American Poetry\"?  Uh, or, uh-let's see now ... maybe I should, uh, take \"Introduction to the Novel.\" \nALVY Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf. \nANNIE What? (Laughing) Hey, listen, what-what do you think?  Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight? \nAlvy leans over and kisses her shoulder. \nALVY No, don't be silly.  What-what do we need other people for? (He puts his arms around her neck, kissing her, Annie making muffled sounds) You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something. \nANNIE (Laughing) Well, okay.  Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay? \nALVY (Yelling out to her as she leaves the room) Yeah, grass, right?  The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday. \nANNIE (Off screen) Well, have you ever made love high? \nALVY Me, no.  You ... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful.  I get too, too wonderful for words.  You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love. \nANNIE (Moving back into the room and lighting a joint) It relaxes me. \nALVY Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed? \nANNIE (Closing the door) Well, what's the difference, anyway? \nALVY Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal.  You can sleep through it. \nANNIE Oh, come on, look who's talking.  You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. (She gets into bed and takes a puff of marijuana) You should smoke some o' this.  You'd be off the couch in no time. \nALVY Oh, come, you don't need that. \nAlvy, sitting down on the bed, moves over to Annie and takes the weed from her. \nANNIE What are you doing? \nALVY (Kissing her) No, no, no, what ... You can once, you can live without it once.  Come on. \nANNIE Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please. (Laughing and making sounds) M'mrnm. \nALVY M'm, wait, I got a great idea. (He gets up and goes over to the closet, taking out a light bulb. He goes back to the bed and turns out the lamp on the night table) Hang in there for a second.  I got a little-little artifact.  A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect. (He turns the lamp back on, having replaced the bulb with the red one from the closet) I just ... there ... There's a little Old New Orleans ... essence.  Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to.  There, now there. (He undresses and crawls into bed, taking Annie in his arms) M'mmm.  M'mmm.  Hey, is something wrong? \nANNIE \nUh-uh-why? \nANNIE No, I don't think so.  No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all.  On the contrary, I think- \nALVY Yeah. \nANNIE It's Easter.  You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat.  I think they're gonna really like you. \nEXT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' HOME-DAY \nThe camera shows a neat two-story house surrounded by a well-manicured green lawn, then cuts to: \nINT. DINING ROOM. \nAlvy and the Halls are eating Easter dinner.  The sun is pouring through a big picture window, shining on a large, elegantly laid out table. Alvy sits, at one end,- rubbing his nose and chewing, the Halls flanking him on either side: Mr. and Mrs. Hall, Grammy, and Annie's brother, Duane. \nMOM HALL (Holding her wine glass) It's a nice ham this year, Mom. \nGrammy Hall takes a sip of her wine and nods. \nANNIE (Smiling at Duane) Oh, yeah.  Grammy always does such a good job. \nDAD HALL (Chewing) A great sauce. \nALVY It is. (Smacking his lips) It's dynamite ham. \nGrammy Hall stares down the table at Alvy; a look of utter dislike. Alvy tries not to notice. \nMOM HALL (To Dad Hall, smoothing her hair) We went over to the swap meet.  Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames. \nANNIE We really had a good time. \nGrammy continues to stare at Alvy; he is now dressed in the long black coat and hat of the Orthodox Jew, complete with mustache and heard. \nMOM HALL (Lighting a cigarette and turning to Alvy) Ann tells us that you've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. \nALVY (Setting down his glass and coughing) Yes.  I'm making excellent progress. Pretty soon when I lie down on his couch, I won't have to wear the lobster bib. \nMom Hall reacts by sipping from her glass and frowning.  Grammy continues to stare. \nDAD HALL Duane and I went out to the boat basin. \nDUANE We were caulkin' holes all day. \nDAD HALL Yeah. (Laughing) Randolph Hunt was drunk, as usual. \nMOM HALL Oh, that Randolph Hunt.  You remember Randy Hunt, Annie.  He was in the choir with you. \nANNIE Oh, yes, yes. \nAlvy, leaning his elbow on the table, looks out toward the camera. \nALVY (To the audience) I can't believe this family. (Making chewing sounds) Annie's mother.  She really's beautiful. And they're talkin' swap meets and boat basins, and the old lady at the end of the table (Pointing to Grammy) is a classic Jew hater.  And, uh, they, they realty look American, you know, very healthy and ... like they never get sick or anything.  Nothing like my family.  You know, the two are like oil and water. \nThe screen splits in half - on the right is Alvy's family - his mother, father, aunt and uncle-busily eating at the crowded kitchen table.  They eat quickly and interrupt one another loudly.  On the left the Halls in their dining room. Both dialogues overlap, juxtaposed. \nALVY'S FATHER Let 'im drop dead!  Who needs his business?! \nALVY'S MOTHER His wife has diabetes! \nALVY'S FATHER Di-diabetes?  Is that any excuse? Diabetes? \nALVY'S UNCLE The man is fifty years old and doesn't have a substantial job. \nALVY'S AUNT (Putting more meat on her husband's plate) Is that a reason to steal from his father? \nALVY'S UNCLE Whatta you talkin' about?  You don't know what you're talking about. \nALVY'S AUNT Yes, I know what I'm talking about. \nALVY'S MOTHER (Interrupting) George, defend him! \nALVY'S UNCLE (Over Alvy's father's muttering) No Moskowitz he had a coronary. \nALVY'S AUNT You don't say. \nALVY'S MOTHER We fast. \nMOM HALL Stupid Thelma Poindexter ... to the Veterans Hospital. \nDAD HALL My God, he's the new president of the El Regis.  Let me tell you, the man is somethin' else. \nMOM HALL That's Jack's wife.  We used to make that outta raisins. \nANNIE Oh, yes, that's right.  Did you see the new play? \nMOM HALL Oh, you remember her, Annie. \nANNIE That is the worst kind of paranoia. \nALVY Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh.  Pick you up after school. \nANNIE Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase. \nALVY Oh, stop it.  But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course \"Contemporary Crisis in Western Man\"! \nANNIE \"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature\"! You're really close. \nALVY What's the difference?  It's all mental masturbation. \nANNIE (Stopping for a moment) Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about! \nShe walks away. \nALVY (Catching up to her) Hey, don't knock masturbation!  It's sex with someone I love. \nANNIE (Continuing to walk quickly) We're not having an affair.  He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat. \nALVY (Still walking next to her) \"Neat\"!  There's that- What are you-twelve years old?  That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions!  \"He thinks I'm neat.\" \nANNIE Who cares?  Who cares? \nALVY Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know?  Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass! \nThey both stop in the middle of the street. \nANNIE You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him! \nALVY David?  You call your teacher David? \nANNIE It's his name. \nALVY Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name.  Right?  W-What does he call you?  Bathsheba? \nHe walks away. \nANNIE (Calling after him) Alvy!  Alvy!  You're the one who never wanted to make a real commitment.  You don't think I'm smart enough!  We had that argument just last month, or don't ou remember that day? \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN. \nAlvy is at the sink washing dishes as the screen cuts to the scene of last month's argument.  Annie's voice is heard. \nANNIE (Off screen) I'm home! \nALVY (Turning) Oh, yeah?  How'd it go? \nANNIE (Comes into the kitchen and puts down a bag of groceries on the kitchen table) Oh, it was ... (Laughing) really weird.  But she's a very nice woman. \nALVY Yeah? \nANNIE And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up.  So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother. \nALVY M'm. \nANNIE And then she mentioned penis envy ... Did you know about that? \nALVY Me?  I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so ... you know. \nANNIE M'hm. \nALVY G-go on, I'm interested. \nANNIE Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children. \nALVY M'hm. \nANNIE And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love. \nALVY Tsch.  Rea- All this happened in the first hour? \nANNIE M'hm. \nALVY That's amazing. I-I-I ... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got ... nothing like that in- \nANNIE Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried. \nALVY You cried?  I've never once cried. Fantastic ... \nANNIE (Taking groceries from the bag) Yeah. \nALVY I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine. \nYOUNG MAN And I'm exactly the same way. \nALVY I see.  Well, that's very interesting. So you've managed to work out something, huh? \nYOUNG MAN Right. \nYOUNG WOMAN Yeah. \nALVY Oh, well, thanks very much for talking to me. \nHe continues to walk past some other passersby and moves into the street. A mounted policeman comes by and stops near him. Alvy looks at the horse, as if to speak. \nALVY'S VOICE-OVER You know, even as a kid I always went for the wrong women.  I think that's my problem.  When my mother took me to see Snow White, everyone fell in love with Snow White.  I immediately fell for the Wicked Queen. \nThe scene dissolves into a sequence from the animated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  The Wicked Queen, resembling Annie, sits in the palace before her mirror.  Alvy, as a cartoon figure, sits beside her, arms crossed in front of him. \nWICKED QUEEN We never have any fun anymore. \nCARTOON FIGURE ALVY How can you say that? \nWICKED QUEEN Why not?  You're always leaning on me to improve myself. \nCARTOON FIGURE ALVY You're just upset.  You must be getting your period. \nWICKED QUEEN I don't get a period!  I'm a cartoon character.  Can't I be upset once in a while? \nRob, as a cartoon figure, enters and sits down on the other side of the Wicked Queen. \nCARTOON FIGURE ROB Max, will you forget about Annie?  I know lots of women you can date. \nCARTOON FIGURE ALVY I don't wanna go out with any other women. \nCARTOON FIGURE ROB Max, have I got a girl for you.  You are going to love her.  She's a reporter- \nThe cartoon figures of Alvy and Rob walk past the Wicked Queen; the screen dissolves into the interior of a concert ball.  Rob's voice carries over from the cartoon scene as the screen shows Alvy with the female reporter.  It's very crowded, noisy; policeman and reporters are everywhere. Alvy stands with his hands in his pockets, watching the commotion. \nCARTOON FIGURE ROB'S VOICE-OVER -for Rolling Stone. \nFEMALE REPORTER I think there are more people here to see the Maharishi than there were to see the Dylan concert.  I covered the Dylan concert ... which gave me chills. Especially when he sang \"She takes just like a woman And she makes love just like a woman Yes, she does And she aches just like a woman But she breaks just like a little girl.\" (They move toward the aisles as a guard holds up his hands to stop them) Up to that I guess the most charismatic event I covered was Mick's Birthday when the Stones played Madison Square Garden. \nALVY (Laughing) Man, that's great.  That's just great. \nREPORTER You catch Dylan? \nALVY (Coughing) Me?  No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis. \nREPORTER You have a raccoon? \nALVY (Gesturing) Tsch, a few. \nREPORTER The only word for this is trans-plendid. It's trans-plendid. \nALVY I can think of another word. \nREPORTER He's God!  I mean, this man is God!  He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment. \nALVY Really?  It must be a tremendous hem. \nREPORTER I'm a Rosicrucian myself. \nALVY Are you? \nREPORTER Yeah. \nALVY I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics.  Look- (The Maharisbi, a small, chunky man, walks out of the men's room, huge bodyguards flanking him while policemen bold back the crowds) there's God coming outta the men's room. \nREPORTER It's unbelievably trans-plendid!  I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember? \nALVY Yeah, were yuh?  I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes. \nINT. ALVY'S BEDROOM-NIGHT \nThe reporter is sitting up in bed, lighted cigarette in her hand.  Alvy, lying next to her, rubs his eyes and puts on his eyeglasses. \nREPORTER (Looking down at him) I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish. \nALVY (Sighing) Oh, no, no, don't be ... tsch ... don't be silly.  You know, (Yawning) I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now. \nREPORTER Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience. \nALVY Oh, tsch, thank you.  H'm. \nREPORTER I mean that as a compliment. \nALVY (Making sounds) I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life. \nANNIE Yeah? \nALVY Two ... Yeah.  Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em. \nAlvy starts walking down the ball again, Annie following. \nANNIE Two? \nALVY (Opening a closet door) Yep.  I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider.  You got a broom or something with a- \nANNIE Oh, I-I left it at your house. \nALVY (Overlapping) -snow shovel or anything or something. \nANNIE (Overlapping) I think I left it there, I'm sorry. \nReaching up into the closet, Alvy takes out a covered tennis racquet. \nALVY (Holding the racquet) Okay, let me have this. \nANNIE Well, what are you doing ... what are you doing with- \nALVY Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick. \nHe walks into the bathroom, Annie looking after him. \nANNIE Well, okay.  Oooh. \nAlvy stands in the middle of the bathroom, tennis racquet in one band, rolled magazine in the other.  He looks over at the shelf above the sink and picks up a small container.  He holds it out, shouting off screen to Annie. \nALVY Hey, what is this?  You got black soap? \nANNIE (Off screen) It's for my complexion. \nALVY Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez. (Alvy turns and starts swapping the racquet over the shelf, knocking down articles and breaking glass) Don't worry! (He continues to swat the racquet all over the bathroom.  He finally moves out of the room, hands close to his body.  He walks into the other room, where Annie is sitting in a corner of her bed leaning against the wall) I did it!  I killed them both.  What-what's the matter?  Whatta you- (Annie is sobbing, her band over her face) -whatta you sad about?  You- What'd you want me to do?  Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em? \nANNIE (Sobbing and taking Alvy's arm) Oh, don't go, okay?  Please. ALVY (Sitting down next to her) Whatta you mean, don't go?  Whatta-whatta -what's the matter?  Whatta you expecting -termites?  What's the matter? \nANNIE (Sobbing) Oh, uh, I don't know.  I miss you.  Tsch. \nShe beats her fist on the bed.  Reacting, Alvy puts his arm around her shoulder and leans back against the wall. \nALVY Oh, Jesus, really? \nANNIE (Leaning on his shoulder) Oh, yeah.  Oh. (They kiss) Oh!  Alvy? \nALVY What? \nHe touches her face gently as she wipes tears from her face. \nANNIE Was there somebody in your room when I called you? \nALVY W-w-whatta you mean? \nANNIE I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice. \nALVY Oh, I had the radio on. \nANNIE Yeah? \nALVY I'm sorry.  I had the television set ... I had the television- \nANNIE Yeah. \nAlvy pulls her to him and they kiss again. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ALVY'S BED \nAlvy is lying in bed next to Annie, who is leaning on her elbow looking down at him.  He rubs her arms and she smiles. \nANNIE Alvy, let's never break up again.  I don't wanna be apart. \nALVY Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that. \nANNIE Living together hasn't been so bad, has it? \nALVY It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages.  See, 'cause. . . 'cause there's just something different about you.  I don't know what it is, but it's great. \nANNIE (Snickering) You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and ... Yeah. \nALVY I don't know. \nANNIE Alvy, what about ... what if we go away this weekend, and we could- \nROB (Pointing) Hey, Max!  Who's that? \nAs the three friends watch Alvy's old living room, the scene has suddenly shifted.  A huge crowd stands around the room, laughing, eating, chatting and vibrating with the turns of the roller-coaster ride. \nALVY It-it-it's the welcome-home party in nineteen forty-five, for my cousin Herbie. \nADULT ALVY (Pointing) Look, look, there's-there's that one over there, that's Joey Nichols, he was my- (Young Alvy stands next to Joey Nichols, who's sitting in one of the easy chairs.  They smile at each other; people and noise all around) -father's friend.  He was always bothering me when I was a kid. \nJOEY Joey Nichols. (Laughing) See.  Nichols.  See, Nichols! (Joey shows young Alvy his cuff links and a tie pin, which are made from nickels, as Alvy stands with hands on hips, unconcerned. Joey then slaps his band to his forehead and puts a nickel on his forehead) Yuh see, nickels!  You can always remember my name, just think of Joey Five Cents. (Laughing) That's me.  Joey Five Cents! \nJoey grabs Alvy's cheeks and pinches them. \nYOUNG ALVY (Turning away) What an asshole! \nA group of women stands near a buffet table eating and listening to Alvy mother and her sister, Tessie, and a young girl, as the three friends watch. \nALVY'S MOTHER I was always the sister with good common sense.  But Tessie was always the one with personality.  When she was younger, they all wanted to marry Tessie. \nShe touches Tessie's shoulder.  Tessie starts to laugh. \nADULT ALVY (Pointing, to Rob) Do you believe that, Max?  Tessie Moskowitz had the personality.  She's the life of the ghetto, no doubt. \nALVY'S MOTHER (To the young girl) She was once a great beauty. \nTessie nods her head \"yes.\" \nROB Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality. \nTESSIE (Addressing the young girl) I was a great beauty. \nROB Uh, how did this personality come about? \nTESSIE (Grabbing the young girl's cheek) I was very charming. \nROB There were many men interested in you? \nTESSIE (To the young girl) Oh, I was quite a lively dancer. \nTessie gyrates back and forth imitating a dancer while Annie and the adult Alvy lean on each other laughing. \nROB (Laughing) That's pretty hard to believe. \nEXT. STREET. \nAlvy and Annie walk contentedly down a street; Alvy's arm is draped around Annie.  People walk by them on the street as they move toward their apartment building. \nANNIE Well, I had a really good day, you know that?  It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday. \nALVY Ah?  Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh. \nANNIE Yeah, but it's real close. \nALVY Yeah, but no presents till midnight. \nANNIE (Laughing) Oh, darn it. \nINT. APARTMENT \nAnnie and Alvy sit on the sofa.  Annie's unwrapping a gift while Alvy watches. \nANNIE (Making sounds) This is- (Making sounds) Huh? \nShe pulls out flimsy black lingerie from the box. \nALVY Happy birthday. \nANNIE What is this? Is this a...Present? (Laughing) Are you kidding? \nALVY Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on? \nANNIE Uh, yeah, uh ... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's- \nALVY Try it ... it'll add years to our sex life. \nANNIE (Looking up at Alvy and laughing) Uh huh.  Yeah.  Forget it. \nAlvy leans over and hands her another box as she puts down the lingerie. \nALVY Here's a real present. \nANNIE (Opening the gift) What... huh? \nALVY Check it out. \nANNIE Oh, yeah?  What is this, anyway? (continuing) Let me see.  Okay, let's... oooh, God! (She takes out a watch from the box) Oh, you knew I wanted this ... (Laughing) God, it's terrific, God! \nTONY Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now ... that's fine, too.  W-w-w-we'll do it another time. \nANNIE Hey- \nTONY Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and ... and we'll meet there. \nHe shakes hands with Annie. \nANNIE (Reacting) Oh. \nTONY It was a wonderful set. \nANNIE Oh, gosh. \nTONY (Smiling) I really enjoyed it. (Looking at Alvy) Nice to have metcha.  Good night. \nENTOURAGE Bye-bye. \nANNIE Nice to see you ... bye.  Yeah.  Bye. \nShe turns and looks at Alvy. \nALVY (Reacting) What's ... you ... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party? \nANNIE (Looking down at her hands, then up at Alvy) I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people. \nALVY (Sighing) I'm just not ... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to ... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot.  You know, and it's-it's not good for my ... (Making sounds) \nANNIE All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do? \nINT. MOVIE THEATER. \nThe screen is projecting the beginning of \"The Sorrow and the Pity\": a street filled with fleeing cars, belongings tied on top and piled in the back seats. Subtitles pop on: \n\"The Jewish warmongers and Parisian plutocrats tried to flee with their gold and jewels\" \nas a narrator explains in German. \nCUT TO. \nSplit screen: Annie and her psychiatrist on the left; Alvy and his on the right. Annie, talking, sits in a white molded chair, as does her doctor. The office is very modern: stark, white and chrome. Alvy, talking to his psychiatrist, lies on a deep leather sofa, the doctor seated away from him. This office looks more like a well-worn den: bookcases overflowing, dark wood. The dialogue is separated in each screen, though no one talks simultaneously. \nANNIE (To her doctor) That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time. \nALVY (To his doctor) Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem. \nANNIE Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied. \nALVY'S PSYCHIATRIST How often do you sleep together? \nANNIE'S PSYCHIATRIST Do you have sex often? \nALVY Hardly ever.  Maybe three times a week. \nANNIE Constantly!  I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex. \nALVY She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's- \nANNIE And ... I don't know ... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it.  I woulda done it, just to please him. \nALVY I mean ... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my-my red light bulb, and ... \nANNIE But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings.  I think you woulda been happy because ... uh, uh, I really asserted myself. \nALVY The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed. \nANNIE I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him.  But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings.  I don't know I-I can't win. \nALVY (Simultaneously, with Annie) You know ... it's getting expensive ...my analyst ... for her analyst.  She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress.  Her progress is defeating my progress. \nANNIE (Simultaneously, with Alvy) Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman. \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT \nAlvy and Annie sit close together on the sofa in some friends' apartment. Their friends, another couple, stand behind the sofa in the background. Excited, they talk almost all at once. \nWOMAN FRIEND Wow, I don't believe it ... you mean to tell me you guys have never snorted coke? \nANNIE Well, I always wanted to try, you know, but, uh, Alvy, uh ... he's very down on it. \nALVY Hey, don't put it on me.  You kn- Wh-what is it, I don't wanna put a wad of white powder in my nose 'cause the-the nasal membranes ... \nThey all start talking at once. \nALVY Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke. \nROB Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging. \nALVY There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here. \nROB While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show.  And we're invited to a big Christmas party. \nThey continue driving, now in a less residential area, passing a hot-dog stand. \"Tail-Pup\" concession; people mill about eating hot dogs. \nVOICES (Singing, louder now) Remember Christ our Savior Was born on Christmas day To save us all ... from Satan's power As we were gone astray. \nThey pass a theater, the marquee announcing \"House of Exorcism Messiah of Evil. Rated R.  Starts at 7:15.\" \nINT. TV CONTROL ROOM. \nSeveral monitors line the wall in front of an elaborate console.  Rob and Alvy, along with Charlie, the technician, stand in the small room watching the screens showing Rob as a television star on a situation comedy.  They chatter, analyzing the footage, over the sounds of the taped television comedy. \nALVY (Overlapping the chatter) Oh. \nROB Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here. \nROB ON TV SCREEN A limousine to the track breakdown? \nROB (Watching) A little bigger. \nTV monitors go black as the technician turns of the monitors to fix the laugh track. \nALVY Do you realize how immoral this all is? \nROB Max, I've got a hit series. \nALVY Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs. \nTechnicians turn the monitors back on, showing Rob on the screen with another character, Arnie. \nARNIE Oh, I'm sorry. \nROB ON TV SCREEN Arnie. \nARNIE Yeah. \nROB (Turning to the technician) Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie. \nALVY Look, uh ... \nLoud laughter from the TV monitors. \nROB (To Alvy) We do the show live in front of an audience. \nALVY Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny. \nROB Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite. \nROB ON TV SCREEN You better lie down.  You've been in the sun too long. \nROB (To the technician) Yeah ... uh, now give me a like a medium-size chuckle here ... and then a big hand. \nThe sounds of laughter and applause are heard from the TV. \nALVY (Removing his glasses and rubbing his face) Is there booing on there? \nThe monitors show a woman on the screen. \nWOMAN We were just gonna fix you up with my cousin Dolores. \nALVY (Overlapping the TV) Oh, Max, I don't feel well. \nROB What's the matter? \nALVY I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy... (Coughing) I feel dizzy, Max. \nROB Well, sit down. \nALVY (Sitting down) Oh, Jesus. \nROB You all right? \nALVY I don't know, I mean, I- \nROB (Crouching before Alvy, looking at him) You wanna lie down? \nALVY No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning.  I just started getting ... \nROB How about a ginger ale? \nALVY I think he has a little thing for Annie. \nROB Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max.  He goes with that girl over there. \nALVY Where? \nRob nods his head toward a tall woman dressed all in white conversing with a group of people close-by. \nROB The one with the V.P.L. \nALVY V.P.L.? \nROB Visible panty line.  Max, she is gorgeous. \nALVY Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're -you're used to twos, aren't you? \nROB There are no twos, Max. \nALVY Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering. \nROB M'hm. \nALVY And ... uh- \nROB (Interrupting) How do you like this couple, Max? \nA couple moves over toward Rob and Alvy.  The man's arm is around the woman; they stand very close.  In the background, Annie and Tony are still talking. \nROB And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson. \nALVY Yeah, intensive care ward. (Watching the woman in white) My God-hey, Max, I think she's ... I think she's giving me the eye. \nAs Rob and Alvy observe the guests, the woman in white starts walking toward them. \nROB If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole. \nALVY I'll handle it.  I'll handle it.  Hi. \nGIRL IN WHITE You're Alvy Singer, right?  Didn't we meet at EST? \nALVY (Reacting) EST?  No, no, I was never to est. \nGIRL IN WHITE Then how can you criticize it? \nALVY Oh. \nROB Oh, he-he didn't say anything. \nALVY (Laughing) No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I ... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met? \nROB (Shaking his head) Hi.  How do you do. \nGIRL IN WHITE Do you taste to see if the food's poisoned? \nALVY Yeah, he's crazy. \nThe girl in white laughs. \nALVY (Looking at Rob and the girl) Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars. \nROB Yeah.  Right. \nALVY Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace. \nROB We're gonna operate together. \nRob and the girl walk of together as the camera moves in on Tony and Annie standing by the buffet table. \nTONY We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album. \nANNIE I don't know, this is strange to me, you know. \nTONY just ... that's all you need.  You can come and stay here. \nANNIE Oh. \nTONY There's a whole wing in this house. \nANNIE (Laughing) Oh yeah, stay here?  U-huh. \nTONY You can have it to use.  Why-why are you smiling? \nANNIE (Laughing) I don't know.  I don't know. \nShe picks up an hors doeuvre. \nANNIE'S VOICE-OVER (To herself) That was fun.  I don't think California is bad at all.  It's a drag coming home. \nALVY'S VOICE-OVER (To himself) Lotta beautiful women.  It was fun to flirt. \nANNIE'S VOICE-OVER (As she sips coffee) I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore. \nALVY'S VOICE-OVER (An open magazine lies in his lap) I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight.  Whatta I need this? \nANNIE'S VOICE-OVER If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him. \nALVY'S VOICE-OVER If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out.  It'd probably wreck her.  But I should be honest. \nHe looks over at Annie. \nANNIE (Looking back at Alvy) Alvy, uh, let's face it.  You know something, don't think our relationship is working. \nALVY Tsch, I know.  A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know?  It has to constantly move forward or it dies. (He sighs) And I think what we got on our hands (Clearing his throat) is a dead shark. \nINT. ALVY'S LIVING ROOM-DAY \nA lighted Christmas tree stands in the middle of boxes, books, and the general disarray of packing and figuring out what belongs to whom as Alvy helps Annie move out. \nALVY (Holding up a book) Whose \"Catcher in the Rye\" is this? \nANNIE (Walking into the room with an armload of books) Well, let's see now ... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine. \nALVY (Reacting) Oh, it sure has ... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come. \nANNIE (Putting down the books and flipping back her hair) Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do. \nALVY (Riffling through the books) There's no-no question in my mind.  I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt. \nANNIE (Holding a framed picture and moving about) Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine. \nALVY (Looking down at a book) This \"Denial of Death\".  You remember this? \nANNIE Oh- \nALVY This is the first book that I got you. \nAnnie goes over to Alvy.  They both look down at the book; the fireplace, burning nicely, is behind them. \nANNIE -God. \nALVY Remember that day? \nANNIE Right.  Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back.  M'mmm. \nALVY Thanks, honey. \nANNIE (Patting Alvy's shoulder) Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that. \nShe walks away. \nALVY There's no-there's no question about that, 'cause we've given this ... uh, uh, I think a more than fair shot, you know? \nHe tosses the book into the carton. \nANNIE (Off screen) Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me. \nALVY (Off screen) Yeah, and I-I tru-  you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her. \nANNIE (Walking in with another armload of books) Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway? \nALVY Right.  And you-and you know what the beauty part is? \nANNIE What? \nALVY (Holding a small box of buttons) We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause ... Right. \nANNIE (Overlapping) Exactly, but ... exactly.  Ooooh! \nALVY You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this.  You know, they could just break up and remain friends. \nANNIE (Taking a button from a box) Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem- \nALVY (Interrupting) Yeah. \nANNIE I guess these are all yours.  Impeach, uh, Eisenhower ... Impeach Nixon ... Impeach Lyndon Johnson ... Impeach Ronald Reagan. \nEXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET-DAY \nPeople milling about on the sidewalk as Alvy walks out of a store and moves toward the foreground. \nALVY (Into the camera, to the audience) I miss Annie.  I made a terrible mistake. \nANNIE (Adjusting her sunglasses) Oh, Alvy, come on. \nALVY Why?  You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land. \nANNIE (Looking around) Well, whatta you mean?  I mean, it's perfectly fine out here.  I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and-and we play tennis. I mean, that's ... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean ... (Reacting, Alvy looks down at his hands, then up) I'm able to enjoy people more. \nALVY (Sadly) So whatta you ... You're not gonna come back to New York? \nANNIE (Smiling) What's so great about New York?  I mean, it's a dying city.  You read \"Death in Venice.\" \nALVY Hey, you didn't read \"Death in Venice\" till I bought it for yuh. \nANNIE That's right, that's right. (Still smiling) You only gave me books with the word \"death\" in the titles. \nALVY (Nodding his head and gesturing) That's right, 'cause it's an important issue. \nANNIE Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that?  I mean, your life is New York City.  You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself. \nALVY (Toying with his car keys) I can't enjoy anything unless I ... unless everybody is.  I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's ... you know, I-I ... it puts a crimp in my evening. (Looking down at his hands, sadly) So wanna get married or what? \nANNIE (Seriously) No. We're friends.  I wanna remain friends. \nALVY (In disbelief) Okay. (Louder, to the waitress) Check, please.  Can I -can I ... Can I ... Can I ... \nANNIE (Interrupting) You're mad, aren't you? \nALVY (Shaking his head) No. (Then nodding) Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that. \nANNIE Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life.  I really just can't say that that's true.  I mean, you know how wonderful you are.  I mean, you know ... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and-and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap.  Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh (Laughing) h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh? \nALVY (Shrugging his shoulders) The usual, you know. Uh, tryin't'write. I'm workin' on a play. (Sighing) Jesus.  So whatta yuh saying?  That you're not comin' back to New York with me? \nHe nods his head in disbelief. \nANNIE (Nodding) No! (Pauses) Look, I gotta go. \nShe starts to rise. \nALVY You mean that ... (He gets up and starts following her past diners at other tables) I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you. \nANNIE I'm late. \nALVY Air miles, you know.  I mean, you know what that does to my stomach? \nThey move down the steps of the cafe' toward the parking lot. \nANNIE If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony.  The Grammys are tonight. \nALVY The what? \nANNIE The Grammys.  He's got a lotta records up for awards. \nALVY You mean they give awards for that kind o' music? \nANNIE Oh! \nALVY I thought just earplugs. \nAnnie gets into her car.  Alvy moves over to his rented convertible. \nANNIE Just forget it, Alvy, okay?  Let's just forget the conversation. \nShe closes the door, starts the motor. \nALVY (Yelling after her) Awards! They do nothing but give out awards!  I can't believe it.  Greatest, greatest fascist dictator, Adolf Hitler! \nAnnie drives away. Alvy gets behind the wheel, starts the motor. Putting the car in gear, he inadvertently moves forward, hitting a bunch of trash cans with a loud crash. Putting the car in reverse, Alvy notices a beige car that has just turned into the parking lot. For a brief moment, the screen shows a flashback of the bumper-car ride at the Brooklyn amusement park.  Alvy's father is on the Platform directing traffic; young Alvy is in a small car bumping others right and left.  Alvy, hack in the parking lot, backs up his convertible, purposefully smashing the side of the beige car as another flashback of bumper- car ride appears, this time-as, Alvy's father directs traffic-a Marine in a small car bits the back end of a soldier's car, and Alvy, back in the parking lot, moves his car over to another parked car and bits it full force. \nAnother flashback appears. people in the small cars really racing around the track now, bumping into one another over and over again, Alvy's father directing the flow, as the film cuts back to the parking lot, where Alvy reverses the convertible and rams it into the front end of yet another car. \nHe sits behind the wheel as people rush out of various cars and as sirens start blaring, coming closer and closer, stopping finally as a motorcycle cop gets off beside Alvy's car and walks over to him. \nALVY (Getting out of the car) Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with-with-with- \nOFFICER (Interrupting) May I see your license, please? \nALVY Sure. (Searching, he finally fishes his license out of his pocket) just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean?  'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here.  You know, it's a rented car.  And I've ... \nHe drops the license and it falls to the ground. \nOFFICER Don't give me your life story (Looking at the piece of paper on the ground) -just pick up the license. \nALVY Pick up the license.  You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day.  You know, my girl friend- \nOFFICER (Interrupting) Just give me the license, please. \n", "test1_input": "ANNIE HALL \nANNIE HALL \nwritten by Woody Allen Marshall Brickman \n(Sound and Woody Allen monologue begin) \nFADE IN: \nWhite credits dissolve in and out on black screen.

He wearing a crumbled sports jacket and tieless shirt; the background is stark. \nALVY There's an old joke.  Uh, two elderly women are at a Catskills mountain resort, and one of 'em says: \"Boy, the food at this place is really terrible.\" The other one says, \"Yeah, I know, and such ... small portions.\" Well, that's essentially how I feel about life.  Full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness, and it's all over much too quickly.  The-the other important joke for me is one that's, uh, usually attributed to Groucho Marx, but I think it appears originally in Freud's wit and its relation to the unconscious.  And it goes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ... \"I would never wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member.\" That's the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women.  Tsch, you know, lately the strangest things have been going through my mind, 'cause I turned forty, tsch, and I guess I'm going through a life crisis or something, I don't know. I, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging. I'm not one o' those characters, you know. Although I'm balding slightly on top, that's about the worst you can say about me.  I, uh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get older, you know?  I think I'm gonna be the- the balding virile type, you know, as opposed to say the, uh, distinguished gray, for instance, you know?  'Less I'm neither o' those two. Unless I'm one o' those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria with a shopping bag screaming about socialism. (Sighing) Annie and I broke up and I-I still can't get my mind around that.  You know, I-I keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind and-and examining my life and tryin' to figure out where did the screw-up come, you know, and a year ago we were... tsch, in love.  You know, and-and-and ... And it's funny, I'm not-I'm not a morose type.  I'm not a depressive character. I-I-I, uh, (Laughing) you know, I was a reasonably happy kid, I guess.  I was brought up in Brooklyn during World War II. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE-DAY \nAlvy as young boy sits on a sofa with his  mother in an old-fashioned, cluttered doctor's office.  The doctor stands near the sofa, holding a cigarette and listening. \nMOTHER (To the doctor) He's been depressed.  All off a sudden, he can't do anything. \nDOCTOR (Nodding) Why are you depressed, Alvy? \nMOTHER (Nudging Alvy) Tell Dr. Flicker. (Young Alvy sits, his head down.  His mother answers for him) It's something he read. \nDOCTOR (Puffing on his cigarette and nodding) Something he read, huh? \nALVY (His head still down) The universe is expanding. \nDOCTOR The universe is expanding? \nALVY (Looking up at the doctor) Well, the universe is everything, and if it's expanding, someday it will break apart and that would be the end of everything! \nDisgusted, his mother looks at him. \nMOTHER (shouting) What is that your business? (she turns back to the doctor) He stopped doing his homework. \nALVY What's the point? \nMOTHER (Excited, gesturing with her hands) What has the universe got to do with it? You're here in Brooklyn!  Brooklyn is not expanding! \nDOCTOR (Heartily, looking down at Alvy) It won't be expanding for billions of years yet, Alvy.  And we've gotta try to enjoy ourselves while we're here.  Uh? \nHe laughs. \nCUT TO: \nFall shot of house with an amusement-park roller-coaster ride built over it.

HOUSE \nAlvy as a child sits at the table eating soup and reading a comic book while his father sits on the sofa reading the paper.  The house shakes with every move of the roller coaster. \nALVY'S VOICE -coaster in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.  Maybe that accounts for my personality, which is a little nervous, I think. \nCUT TO: \nYoung Alvy at the food-stand concession watching three military men representing the Army, the Navy and the Marines arm in arm with a blond woman in a skirted bathing suit.  They all turn and run toward the foreground.  The girl stops before the camera to lean over and throw a kiss.  The sign over the concession reads \"Steve's Famous Clam Bar.  Ice Cold Beer, \"and the roller coaster is moving in full gear in the background. \nALVY'S VOICE You know, I have a hyperactive imagination. My mind tends to jump around a little, and have some trouble between fantasy and reality. \nCUT TO: \nFull shot of people in bumper cars thoroughly enjoying bumping into each other as Alvy father stands in the center of the track directing traffic. \nALVY'S VOICE My father ran the bumper-car concession.

But I-I-I-I used to get my aggression out through those cars all the time. \nAlvy backs up his car off screen. \nINT. SCHOOLROOM - DAY \nThe camera pans over three austere-looking teachers standing in front of the blackboard.  The chalk writing on the board changes as each teacher lectures. While Alvy speaks, one of the male teachers puts an equation on the blackboard. - \"2 X 10 = 20 \" and other arithmetic formulas. \nALVY'S VOICE I remember the staff at our public school.  You know, we had a saying, uh, that \"Those who can't do, teach, and those who can't teach, teach gym.\" And ...uh, h'h, of course, those who couldn't do anything, I think, were assigned to our school.

Step up here! \nAs the teacher, really glaring now, speaks, Alvy rises from his seat and moves over to her.  Angry, she points with her band while the students turn their heads to watch what will happen next. \nALVY What'd I do? \nTEACHER Step up here! \nALVY What'd I do? \nTEACHER You should be ashamed of yourself. \nThe students, their heads still turned, look back at Alvy, now an adult, sitting in the last seat of the second row. \nALVY (AS ADULT) (First off screen, then onscreen as camera moves over to the back of the classroom) Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity. \nTEACHER (The younger, Alvy standing next to her) Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds. \nALVY (AS ADULT) (Still sitting in the back of the classroom) I did. \nThe girl the young Alvy kissed turns to the older Alvy, she gestures and speaks. \n1ST GIRL For God's sakes, Alvy, even Freud speaks of a latency period. \nALVY (AS ADULT) (Gesturing) Well, I never had a latency period.  I can't help it. \nTEACHER (With young, Alvy still at her side) Why couldn't you have been more like Donald? (The camera pans over to Donald, sitting up tall in his seat, then back to the teacher) Now, there was a model boy! \nALVY (AS CHILD) (Still standing next to the teacher) Tell the folks where you are today, Donald. \nDONALD I run a profitable dress company. \nALVY'S VOICE Right.  Sometimes I wonder where my classmates are today. \nThe camera shows the full classroom, the students sitting behind their desks, the teacher standing in the front of the room.  One at a time, the young students rise u from their desks and speak. \n1ST BOY I'm president of the Pinkus Plumbing Company. \n2ND BOY I sell tallises. \n3RD BOY I used to be a heroin addict.

MANHATTAN STREET-DAY \nA pretty Manhattan street with sidewalk trees, brownstones, a school; people mill about, some strolling and carrying bundles, others buried.  The screen shows the whole length of the sidewalk, a street, and part of the sidewalk beyond.  As the following scene ensues, two pedestrians, indistinguishable in the distance, come closer and closer toward the camera, recognizable, finally, as Alvy and his best friend, Rob, deep in conversation.

My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem!  Huh? \nThe man in front of them turns to look at them, then looks away. \nALVY I never read that.  That was-that was Henry James, right?  Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw?  My Sexual ... \nMAN IN LINE (Even louder now) It's the influence of television.  Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?

I mean, it's just maddening! \nThe man in line moves toward Alvy.  Both address the audience now. \nMAN IN LINE Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion?

General Eisenhower is not ... \nALLISON (Looking out at the stage) Allison. \nALVY Yeah?  Allison what? \nALLISON (Still looking off screen) Portchnik. \nCOMEDIAN ... a group from the ... \nALVY (Coughing) Thank you. I-I don't know why they would have me at this kind of rally 'cause ... (He clears his throat) Excuse me, I'm not essentially a political comedian at all. \nThe audience starts to laugh. \nALVY I ... interestingly had, uh, dated ... a woman in the Eisenhower Administration ... briefly ... and, uh, it was ironic to me 'cause, uh . . . tsch . . . 'cause I was trying to, u-u-uh, do to her what Eisenhower has been doing to the country for the last eight years. \nThe audience is with him, laughing, as Allison continues to watch offstage. \nINT. APARTMENT BEDROOM. \nAllison and, Alvy are on the bed, kissing.  There are books all over the room; a fireplace, unlit, along one of the walls. Alvy suddenly breaks away and sits on the edge of the bed. Allison looks at him. \nALVY H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison ... it's obsessing me! \nALLISON Well, I'm getting tired of it.  I need your attention. \nAlvy gets up from the bed and starts walking restlessly around the room, gesturing with his hands. \nALVY It-but it-it ... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound.  So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once?  It doesn't make sense. \nALLISON Alvy. \nAlvy, stopping for a moment at the fireplace mantel, sighs.  He then snaps his fingers and starts walking again. \nALVY I'll tell you this!  He was not marksman enough to hit a moving target at that range.  But ... (Clears his throat) if there was a second assassin ... it- That's it! \nAlvy stops at the music stand with open sheet music on it as Allison gets up from the bed and retrieves a pack of cigarettes from a bookshelf. \nALLISON We've been through this. \nALVY If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle. \nALLISON (Moving back to the bed and lighting a cigarette) Okay.  All right, so whatta yuh saying, now?  That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right? \nALVY Well, why not? \nALLISON Yeah, Earl Warren? \nALVY (Moving toward the bed) Hey ... honey, I don't know Earl Warren. \nALLISON Lyndon Johnson? \nALVY (Propping one knee on the bed and gesturing) L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician.  You know the ethics those guys have?  It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester. \nALLISON Then everybody's in in the conspiracy? \nALVY (Nodding his head) Tsch. \nALLISON The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House? \nAlvy touches Allison's shoulder, then gets up from the bed and starts walking again. \nALVY I-I-I-I would leave out the men's-room attendant. \nALLISON You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me. \nALVY Oh, my God! (Then, to the camera) She's right!  Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik?  She was-she was beautiful.  She was willing.  She was real ... intelligent. (Sighing) Is it the old Groucho Marx joke?  That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member? \n", "test3_true": "Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard over the wind-browned exterior of a beach house in the Hamptons. As they continue to talk, the camera moves inside the house. Alvy is picking up chairs, trying to get at the group of lobsters crawling on the floor.  Dishes are stacked up in a drying rack, and bags of groceries sit on the counter.  There's a table and chairs near the refrigerator. \nANNIE Alvy, now don't panic.  Please. \nALVY Look, I told you it was a ... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house. \nANNIE Stop it!  Don't ... don't do that!  There. \nThe lobsters continue to crawl on the floor.  Annie, bolding out a wooden paddle, tries to shove them onto it. \nALVY Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad. \nANNIE Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake. \nALVY If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up. \nANNIE Oh, all right.  All right!  It's all right.  Here. \nShe drops the paddle and picks up one of the lobsters by the tail.  Laughing, she shoves it at Alvy who jerks backward, squeamishly. \nALVY Don't give it to me.  Don't! \nANNIE (Hysterically) Oooh!  Here!  Here! \nALVY (Pointing) Look!  Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator.  It'll turn up in our bed at night. (They move over to the refrigerator; Alvy moves as close to the wall as possible as Annie, covering her mouth and laughing hysterically, teasingly dangles a lobster in front of him) Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus! \nANNIE (Laughing, to the lobster) Get him! \nALVY (Laughing) Talk to him.  You speak shellfish! (He moves over to the stove and takes the lid of a large steamer filled with boiling water) Hey, look ... put it in the pot. \nANNIE (Laughing) I can't!  I can't put him in the pot.  I can't put a live thing in hot water. \nALVY (Overlapping) Gimme!  Gimme!  Let me do it!  What-what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies? \nAnnie hands the lobster to Alvy as he takes it very carefully and drops it gingerly into the pot and puts the cover back on. \nANNIE (Overlapping Alvy and making sounds) Oh, God!  Here yuh go!  Oh, good, now he'll think- (She screams) Aaaah!  Okay. \nALVY (Overlapping Annie) Okay, it's in.  It's definitely in the pot! \nANNIE All right.  All right.  All right. \nShe moves hurriedly across the kitchen and picks up another lobster.  Smiling, she places it on the counter as Alvy stands beside the refrigerator trying to push it from the wall. \nALVY Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator.  I can't get it out. This thing's heavy.  Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean? \nANNIE (Overlapping) Yeah.  I'm gonna get my ... I'm gonna get my camera. \nALVY You know, I-I think ... if I could pry this door off ... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs.  They don't run around. \nAnnie rushes out of the room to get her camera as Alvy picks up the paddle. Trying to get at the lobsters, he ends up knocking over dishes and hitting the chandelier.  Holding the paddle, he finally leans back against the sink. Annie, standing in the doorway, starts taking pictures of him. \nANNIE Great!  Great! (Screaming) Goddammit! (Screaming) Ooooh!  These are ... p-p-p-pick this lobster up.  Hold it, please! \nALVY All right!  All right!  All right!  All right!  Whatta yuh mean?  Are yuh gonna take pictures now? \nANNIE It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful ... Ooooh, lovely! \nALVY (Picking up the lobster Annie placed on the counter earlier) All right, here!  Oh, God, it's disgusting! \nAlvy drops the lobster back down on the counter, sticking out his tongue and making a face. \nANNIE Don't be a jerk.  One more, Alvy, please, one more picture. (Reluctantly Alvy picks up the lobster again as Annie takes another picture) Oh, oh, good, good! \nEXT. OCEAN FRONT-DUSK. \nThe camera pans Annie and Alvy as they walk along the shore. \nALVY So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what ... (He clears his throat) Am I your first big romance? \nANNIE Oh ... no, no, no, no, uh, uh.  No. \nALVY Well, then, w-who was? \nANNIE Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School. \nCUT TO: \nFLASHBACK OF DENNIS LEANING AGAINST A CAR - NIGHT \nBehind him is a movie theater with \"MARILYN MONROE, 'MISFITS' \" on the marquee. He looks at his watch as the younger Annie, in a beehive hairdo, moves into the frame.  They kiss quickly and look at each other, smiling. \nALVY'S VOICE (Off screen) Dennis-right, uh, uh ... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night. \nANNIE'S VOICE Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then. \n", "test3_id": 1700}

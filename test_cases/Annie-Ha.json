He's one of the most indulgent film makers.  He really is- \nALVY (Overlapping) Key word here is \"indulgent.\" \nMAN IN LINE (Overlapping) -without getting ... well, let's put it this way ... \nALVY (To Annie, who is still reading, overlapping the man in line who is still talking) What are you depressed about? \nANNIE I missed my therapy.  I overslept. \nALVY How can you possibly oversleep? \nANNIE The alarm clock. \nALVY (Gasping) You know what a hostile gesture that is to me? \nANNIE I know-because of our sexual problem, right? \nALVY Hey, you ... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse? \nMAN IN LINE - It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't ... he doesn't hit me on a gut level. \nALVY (To Annie) I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level. \nThe man in line continues his speech all the while Alvy and Annie talk. \nANNIE Stop it, Alvy! \nALVY (Wringing his hands) Well, he's spitting on my neck!  You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks. \nMAN IN LINE And then, the most important thing of all is a comedian's vision. \nANNIE And you know something else?  You know, you're so egocentric that if I miss my therapy you can think of it in terms of how it affects you! \nMAN IN LINE (Lighting a cigarette while he talks) Gal gun-shy is what it is. \nALVY (Reacting again to the man in line) Probably on their first date, right? \nMAN IN LINE (Still going on) It's a narrow view. \nALVY Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books.  \"Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy.\" (He sighs; then to Annie) Whatta you mean, our sexual problem? \nANNIE Oh! \nALVY I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn. \nANNIE Okay, I'm very sorry.  My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem!  Huh? \nThe man in front of them turns to look at them, then looks away. \nALVY I never read that.  That was-that was Henry James, right?  Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw?  My Sexual ... \nMAN IN LINE (Even louder now) It's the influence of television.  Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium ... as opposed to a ... \nALVY (More and more aggravated) What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure. \nMAN IN LINE ... as opposed to a print ... \nAlvy steps forward, waving his hands in frustration, and stands facing the camera. \nALVY (Sighing and addressing the audience) What do you do when you get stuck in a movie line with a guy like this behind you?  I mean, it's just maddening! \nThe man in line moves toward Alvy.  Both address the audience now. \nMAN IN LINE Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country! \nALVY I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud?  I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that?  And-and the funny part of it is, M-Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's...work! \nMAN IN LINE (Overlapping) Wait a minute!  Really?  Really?  I happen to teach a class at Columbia called \"TV Media and Culture\"!  So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan-well, have a great deal of validity. \nALVY Oh, do yuh? \nMAN IN LINE Yes. \nALVY Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here.  So ... so, here, just let me-I mean, all right.  Come over here ... a second. \nAlvy gestures to the camera which follows him and the man in line to the back of the crowded lobby.  He moves over to a large stand-up movie poster and pulls Marshall McLuban from behind the poster. \nMAN IN LINE Oh. \nALVY (To McLuban) Tell him. \nMCLUHAN (To the man in line) I hear-I heard what you were saying.

BEDROOM-NIGHT \nAnnie is sitting up in bed reading. \nALVY (Off screen) Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know?  Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much. \nANNIE M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture. \nALVY (Off screen) You?  You kiddin'? (He moves into the frame, lying across the bed to touch, Annie, who makes a face) If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything. \nANNIE That movie makes me feel guilty. \nALVY Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to. \nHe starts kissing Annie's arm.  She gets annoyed and continues to read. \nANNIE Alvy, I ... \nALVY What-what-what-what's the matter? \nANNIE I-you know, I don't wanna. \nALVY (Overlapping Annie, reacting) What-what-I don't ... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together.  You know, it's been a long time. \nANNIE I know, well, it's just that-you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice. \nALVY (Overlapping Annie again) It's always some kind of an excuse.  It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy.  What ... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly ... We're- we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records. \nANNIE (Patting Alvy's band solicitously) I know.  Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all. \nALVY M'm. \nANNIE I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get.  You were very hot for Allison at first. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BACK STAGE OF AUDITORIUM - NIGHT. \nAllison, clipboard in band, walks about the wings, stopping to talk to various people.  Musicians, performers and technicians mill about, busy with activity. Allison wears a large \"ADLAI\" button, as do the people around her.  The sounds of a comedian on the stage of the auditorium can be heard, occasionally, interrupted by chatter and applause from the off screen audience.  Allison stops to talk to two women; they, too, wear \"ADLAI\" buttons. \nALLISON (Looking down at the clipboard) Ma'am, you're on right after this man ... about twenty minutes, something like that. \nWOMAN Oh, thank you. \nAlvy moves into the frame behind Allison.  He taps her on the shoulder; she turns to face him. \nALVY (Coughing) Excuse ... excuse me, when do I go on? \nALLISON (Looking down at the clipboard) Who are you? \nALVY Alvy ... Alvy Singer.  I'm a comedian. \nALLISON Oh, comedian.  Yes.  Oh, uh ... you're on next. \nALVY (Rubbing his hands together nervously) What do you mean, next? \nALLISON (Laughing) Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act. \nALVY (Gesturing) No, it can't be, because he's a comic. \nALLISON Yes. \nALVY So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row? \nALLISON Why not? \nALVY No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't ... I don't wanna go on after that comedian. \nALLISON It's okay. \nALVY No, because they're-they're laughing, so (He starts laughing nervously) I-I-I'd rather not.  If you don't mind, I prefer- \nALLISON (Overlapping) Will you relax, please?  They're gonna love you, I know. \nALVY (Overlapping) I prefer not to, because ... look, they're laughing at him.

It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately. \nANNIE I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? (putting pictures on the mantel) ALVY No-what, what ...? I ... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together.  Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh? \nHe moves over to the carton of books on the window seat and reaches in.  He starts tossing books off screen. \nANNIE (Looking up at Alvy) How is it any different? \nALVY (Gesturing) It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment. (Holding a book, he starts walking around the room) Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft ... that we know that we're not married. \nHe tosses the book on the bed and walks back to the window seat. \nANNIE (Still sitting on the bed) That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy. \nALVY (Looking at Annie) That place is four hundred dollars a month? \nANNIE Yes, it is. \nALVY (Whistling) It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs.  Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it. \nANNIE (Shaking her head) You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about. \nALVY Hey, don't be ridiculous. \nAlvy moves over to the bed and sits down next to Annie. \nANNIE Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something? \nALVY (Putting his hand to his forehead) 'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating. \nEXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY \nAnnie and Alvy, in Annie's VW, driving to their summerhouse.  The camera moves with them as they pass a house with a lighted window, blooming foliage.  There is no dialogue, but it is a comfortable quiet.  Classical music plays in the background. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT \nAnnie, sitting cross-legged on a wooden chest in the bedroom, is browsing through a school catalogue.  Alvy lies in bed reading. \nANNIE (Reading) Does this sound like a good course? Uh, \"Modern American Poetry\"?  Uh, or, uh-let's see now ... maybe I should, uh, take \"Introduction to the Novel.\" \nALVY Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf. \nANNIE What? (Laughing) Hey, listen, what-what do you think?  Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight? \nAlvy leans over and kisses her shoulder. \nALVY No, don't be silly.  What-what do we need other people for? (He puts his arms around her neck, kissing her, Annie making muffled sounds) You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something. \nANNIE (Laughing) Well, okay.  Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay? \nALVY (Yelling out to her as she leaves the room) Yeah, grass, right?  The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday. \nANNIE (Off screen) Well, have you ever made love high? \nALVY Me, no.  You ... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful.  I get too, too wonderful for words.  You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love. \nANNIE (Moving back into the room and lighting a joint) It relaxes me. \nALVY Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed? \nANNIE (Closing the door) Well, what's the difference, anyway? \nALVY Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal.  You can sleep through it. \nANNIE Oh, come on, look who's talking.  You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. (She gets into bed and takes a puff of marijuana) You should smoke some o' this.  You'd be off the couch in no time. \nALVY Oh, come, you don't need that. \nAlvy, sitting down on the bed, moves over to Annie and takes the weed from her. \nANNIE What are you doing? \nALVY (Kissing her) No, no, no, what ... You can once, you can live without it once.  Come on. \nANNIE Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please. (Laughing and making sounds) M'mrnm. \nALVY M'm, wait, I got a great idea. (He gets up and goes over to the closet, taking out a light bulb. He goes back to the bed and turns out the lamp on the night table) Hang in there for a second.  I got a little-little artifact.  A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect. (He turns the lamp back on, having replaced the bulb with the red one from the closet) I just ... there ... There's a little Old New Orleans ... essence.  Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to.  There, now there. (He undresses and crawls into bed, taking Annie in his arms) M'mmm.  M'mmm.  Hey, is something wrong? \nANNIE \nUh-uh-why? \n", "test2_true": "ANNIE No, I'm fine. \nAs Annie speaks, her inner self (ghostlike, moves up from the bed and) sits down on a chair, watching. \nALVY Really? \nANNIE U-huh. \nALVY I don't know, but you seem sort of distant. \nANNIE Let's just do it, all right? \nALVY (Kissing and caressing Annie) Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions? \nANNIE'S SPIRIT Alvy, do you remember where I put my drawing pad?  Because while you two are doing that, I think I'm gonna do some drawing. \nALVY (Reacting) You see, that's what I call removed. \nANNIE Oh, you have my body. \nALVY Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing. \nANNIE (Sighing) Well, I need grass and so do you. \nALVY Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass (Clearing his throat) because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian- \nANNIE (Overlapping) M'hm. \nALVY (Overlapping) -so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count.  You know-'cause they're always laughin'. \nANNIE Were you always funny? \nALVY Hey, what is this-an interview?  We're supposed to be making love. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OFFICE. \nA typical old-fashioned theatrical agency in a Broadway office building. Autographed 8 X 12 is plastered in the sloppy room.  The agent, chewing a cigar, sits behind his desk talking to one of his clients, a comedian, who stands with his hands in his pockets.  A young Alvy sits stiffly in a chair nearby watching. \nAGENT This guy is naturally funny.  I think he can write for you. \nCOMIC (Buttoning his jacket) Yeah, yeah.  Hey, kid, he tells me you're really good.  Well, lemme explain a little bit o' how I work.  You know, you can tell right off the bat that I don't look like a funny guy when I come-you know, like some o' the guys that come out.  You know, right away (Gesturing) they're gonna tell yuh their stories, you're gonna fall down, but I gotta be really talented.  Material's gotta be sensational for me 'cause I work, you know, with very, very ... Come on, I'm kinda classy, you know what I mean?  Uh ... uh ... lemme explain.  For instance, I open with an opening song.  A musical start like (Ad-lib singing) and I walk out (Ad-lib singing) \"Place looks wonderful from here and you folks look wonderful from here! (Singing) \"And seein' you there With a smile on your face Makes me shout This must be the place.\" Then I stop right in the middle and then I open with some jokes.  Now, that's where I need you, right there.  For instance, like I say, \"Hey, I just got back from Canada, you know, they speak a lotta French up there.  The only way to remember Jeanne d'Arc means the light's out in the bathroom!\" (He laughs.  Seated Alvy looks up smiling) \"Oh, I met a big lumberjack ...\" \nALVY'S VOICE (To himself) Jesus, this guy's pathetic. \nCOMIC (Overlapping above speech) ... big lumberjack ... \nALVY'S VOICE (To himself while the comic continues his routine) Look at him mincing around, like he thinks he's real cute.  You wanna throw up.  If only I had the nerve to do my own jokes.  I don't know how much longer I can keep this smile frozen on my face. I'm in the wrong business, I know it. \nCOMIC (Overlapping above speech) \"'Cherie, come back.  I love you. (Shaking his lips and mimicking) But, uh, Cheri, what will I do with this, uh?' He says, 'Aw, Marie, sometime you make me so mad.\"' (Laughing) Oh, they scream at that.  Now, write me somethin' like that, will yuh?  Kinda French number, can yuh do it?  Huh, kid? \nINT. THEATER - NIGHT \nThe darkened auditorium is filled with college students applauding and cheering, excited, as Alvy stands on spotlighted stage holding the microphone. \nALVY (Gesturing) W-where am I? I-I keep ... I have to reorient myself.  This is the University of Wisconsin, right?  So I'm always ... I'm tense and ... uh, when I'm playin' a col- I've a very bad history with colleges. You know, I went to New York University and, uh, tsch, I was thrown out of NYU my freshman year ... for cheating on my metaphysics final. You know, I looked within the soul of the boy sitting next to me- (The audience laughs; they're with him) -and when I was thrown out, my mother, who's an emotionally high-strung woman, locked herself in the bathroom and took an overdose of mah-jongg tiles. (More applause and laughter) And, uh, tsch, I was depressed.  I was ... in analysis, I-I, uh, was suicidal; as a matter of fact, uh, I would have killed myself but I was in analysis with a strict Freudian and if you kill yourself ... they make you pay for the sessions you miss. \nINT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER. \nStudents mill around Alvy banding him pens and paper for autographs. Annie is next to him, talking over the chattering fans. \nANNIE Alvy, you were ... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding.  It was- You were so neat. \nALVY C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful. \nANNIE Yeah.  Yeah.  And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too. \nALVY Are yuh? \nANNIE Yeah. \nALVY Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine. \nYOUNG WOMAN (Interrupting) May I have your autograph? \nANNIE (Over lapping above speech) Oh. \nALVY (To Annie, while autographing) You're so sure about it. \nANNIE Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow.  I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father. \nThey start moving toward the exit, a girl snapping a picture of Alvy with a flash camera as they walk through the crowd. \nALVY Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.

It's a drag coming home. \nALVY'S VOICE-OVER (To himself) Lotta beautiful women.  It was fun to flirt. \nANNIE'S VOICE-OVER (As she sips coffee) I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore. \nALVY'S VOICE-OVER (An open magazine lies in his lap) I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight.  Whatta I need this? \nANNIE'S VOICE-OVER If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him. \nALVY'S VOICE-OVER If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out.  It'd probably wreck her.  But I should be honest. \nHe looks over at Annie. \nANNIE (Looking back at Alvy) Alvy, uh, let's face it.  You know something, don't think our relationship is working. \nALVY Tsch, I know.  A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know?  It has to constantly move forward or it dies. (He sighs) And I think what we got on our hands (Clearing his throat) is a dead shark. \nINT. ALVY'S LIVING ROOM-DAY \nA lighted Christmas tree stands in the middle of boxes, books, and the general disarray of packing and figuring out what belongs to whom as Alvy helps Annie move out. \nALVY (Holding up a book) Whose \"Catcher in the Rye\" is this? \nANNIE (Walking into the room with an armload of books) Well, let's see now ... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine. \nALVY (Reacting) Oh, it sure has ... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come. \nANNIE (Putting down the books and flipping back her hair) Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do. \nALVY (Riffling through the books) There's no-no question in my mind.  I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt. \nANNIE (Holding a framed picture and moving about) Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine. \nALVY (Looking down at a book) This \"Denial of Death\".  You remember this? \nANNIE Oh- \nALVY This is the first book that I got you. \nAnnie goes over to Alvy.  They both look down at the book; the fireplace, burning nicely, is behind them. \nANNIE -God. \nALVY Remember that day? \nANNIE Right.  Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back.  M'mmm. \nALVY Thanks, honey. \nANNIE (Patting Alvy's shoulder) Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that. \nShe walks away. \nALVY There's no-there's no question about that, 'cause we've given this ... uh, uh, I think a more than fair shot, you know? \nHe tosses the book into the carton. \nANNIE (Off screen) Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me. \nALVY (Off screen) Yeah, and I-I tru-  you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her. \nANNIE (Walking in with another armload of books) Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway? \nALVY Right.  And you-and you know what the beauty part is? \nANNIE What? \nALVY (Holding a small box of buttons) We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause ... Right. \nANNIE (Overlapping) Exactly, but ... exactly.  Ooooh! \nALVY You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this.  You know, they could just break up and remain friends. \nANNIE (Taking a button from a box) Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem- \nALVY (Interrupting) Yeah. \nANNIE I guess these are all yours.  Impeach, uh, Eisenhower ... Impeach Nixon ... Impeach Lyndon Johnson ... Impeach Ronald Reagan. \nEXT.

Kissinger taught there. \nThe couple strolls away as an older woman walks up to Alvy while others walk by. \nOLD WOMAN Don't tell me you're jealous? \nALVY Yeah, jealous. A little bit like Medea. Lemme, lemme-can I show you something, lady? (He takes a small item from his pocket to show the woman) What I have here ... I found this in the apartment.  Black soap.  She used to wash her face eight hundred times a day with black soap. Don't ask me why. \nOLD WOMAN Well, why don't you go out with other women? \nALVY Well, I-I tried, but it's, uh, you know, it's very depressing. \nRECENT FLASHBACK - INT. ALVY'S COUNTRY KITCHEN \nAlvy's arms and legs fill the screen as he slowly gets up from the floor bolding up a live lobster.  He puts it on a grill tray. \nALVY (Pointing to the lobster) This always happens to me.  Quick, g-go get a broom. \nHis date, a girl wearing short shorts, leans against the sink and lights a cigarette.  She makes no move to help. \nGIRL DATE (Smoking) What are you making such a big deal about? (As she talks, the lobster drops from the tray to the floor.  Alvy jumps away, then gingerly scrapes the tray toward the lobster) They're only lobsters.  Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster. \nALVY (Looking up in stooped-over position) I'm not myself since I stopped smoking. \nGIRL DATE (Still leaning against the sink, her hand on her hip) Oh, when'd you quit smoking? \nHe gets up of the floor with the lobster on the tray. \nALVY Sixteen years ago. \nGIRL DATE (Puzzled) Whatta you mean? \nALVY (Mocking) Mean? \nGIRL DATE You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said?  Oh, I-I don't understand.  Are you joking, or what? \nCUT TO: \nA solitary Alvy walking along the FDR Drive where he had walked with Annie. - The New York skyline is still in the background, the sea gulls go by, the fog horn blows.  He walks slowly, moving off screen. \nINT. ALVY'S BEDROOM - DAY \nAlvy sits on his bed talking on the phone. \nALVY Listen, honey, Central Park's turning green ... Yeah, I sa-I saw that lunatic that we-where we used to see ... with the, uh, uh, pinwheel hat and, you know, and the roller skates? . . . Listen, I-I want you to come back here ...

I'm at the Los Angeles Airport. I flew in ... (Sniffling) Tsch, I-well, I flew in to see you ... (Muttering) Hey, listen, can we not debate this on-on the telephone because I'm, you know, I-I feel that I got a temperature and I'm-I'm getting my-my chronic Los Angeles nausea. I-I don't feel so good. \nAlvy's conversation is still heard as the screen shows him behind the wheel of a car on a busy street; he causes a near-accident by jerking the car too slowly toward an intersection. \nALVY'S VOICE-OVER Well, where-wherever you wanna meet, I don't care.  I'll-I'll drive in.  I rented a car I'm driving ... that ... Whatta you mean?  What-why is that such a miracle?  I'm driving myself -- \nEXT. OUTDOOR CAF\u0083 - DAY \nPeople sit at umbrellaed tables with checkered tablecloths at a Sunset Boulevard outdoor cafe.  Street traffic goes by while they dine.  There's a mild California breeze.  The restaurant is somewhat crowded as Alvy makes his way around the tables looking about.  He finally sits down at an empty table; nearby sits a woman with a younger man.  A waitress brings Alvy a menu and waits for his order. \nALVY (To the waitress) I'm gonna...I'm gonna have the alfalfa sprouts and, uh, a plate of mashed yeast. \nAnnie, wearing a flowered dress and wide hat, moves into view.  Alvy, noticing her, watches as she walks over to his table.  He rises and they shake hands. \nANNIE Hi. \nAlvy wipes at his nose as he stares.  He smiles, the street traffic moving behind him. Annie smiles back. \nALVY You look very pretty. \nANNIE Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.

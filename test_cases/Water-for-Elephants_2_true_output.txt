INT. RESTAURANT - ALTOONA, PA - DAY 
Camera discovers a DISHWASHER and REX THE LION, both quivering, huddled opposite each under beneath a sink. 
JACOB (V.O.) I don't know who was more scared - the rubes or the animals. 
EXT. NESCI BROS. TRAIN - CIRCUS GROUNDS - ALTOONA, PA - DAY 
THE NESCI BROS. CIRCUS TRAIN is pulling up alongside the "ghost town"¬ù of the Benzini Bros - the ruins of the circus are highlighted by strong winds blowing up dust and dirt. 
JACOB (V.O.) When the Nesci Bros. Circus showed, we were officially belly up. A MAN SCREAMS after unrolling a canvas and making a discovery inside. A crowd forms. When Jacob reaches it, he sees: 
BLACKIE, DEAD, WITH A MAKESHIFT GARROTTE AROUND HIS NECK. 
INT. MENAGERIE TENT - ALTOONA, PA - DAY 
DICK NESCI and the Sheriff fight with Jacob over Rosie... 
SHERIFF ...These animals are now the property of Altoona and we're here to sell them to Mr. Nesci. 
JACOB Not all of them! Some of these animals are mine, like this bull. 
DICK NESCI Do you have any proof? Jacob is stalled. Greg appears. 
GREG He's right. He's just an elephant tramp. The bull is his. 
JACOB You don't want her anyway. She can't do anything. Dumb as a box of peanut shells. Skeptical, Dick Nesci steps up to Rosie. 
DICK NESCI What's her name? 
JACOB Gertrude. Jacob and Rosie exchange eye contact. Nesci is skeptical. 
DICK NESCI Gertrude! Gertrude, step up! UP! Rosie blows and swings her trunk, throwing dirt across the people around her. Dick Nesci takes the bull hook and prods under her leg, ordering her UP! Rosie just swings her ears and sniffs Dick Nesci with her trunk. Then checks his pockets for treats. Jacob exchanges a look with Rosie. 
EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - ALTOONA, PA - LATER - DAY. 
Jacob is walking Rosie, holding the Orangutan, with Bobo atop Rosie. Through the wind and dust, they look for Marlena. 
FROM OUT OF A WALL OF WIND BLOWN DUST APPEARS MARLENA AND SIX OF HER BLACK AND WHITE HORSES. Marlena looks spent - shocked, relieved, tearful, hopeful. She reaches Jacob. 
MARLENA What happens now? 
JACOB I wish I knew. Marlena exhausted, eases into Jacob's arms. It's over. WIDE ANGLE: Jacob and Marlena and their animals, as the giant tent of the Benzini Bros. Big Top falls to the ground. 
INT. CHARLIE'S TRAILER - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT 
Jacob is finishing his story. Charlie is enthralled. The first bottle of scotch is gone. The second half full. 
JACOB I convinced my dean to let me take my finals. Marlena was right. With my degree, our animals and Marlena's acts, Ringling got a sweet deal. Our son was born our first season. We named him Walter. He spent the first seven years of his life with Ringling. 
(BEAT) That's why I...I just can't understand how he forgot to show up today. (His eyes glitter 
CHILDLIKE) There was a circus in town. Charlie understands. He looks affectionately at Jacob. 
JACOB (CONT'D) By the time our third son came, we'd had enough. Rosie was tired. (Charlie smiles. ) Luckily, the vet at the Albany Zoo dropped dead, so I got the job. 
(MORE) 
JACOB (CONT'D) We bought some property so we could keep the horses...Rosie...then five kids...Bobo and that Orangutan...Never named that Orangutan. Nothing ever sounded.. elegant enough for her. Just called her Ma'am. (Smiles with great joy) Man oh man that was...that was a life, boy, I'll tell ya... Charlie smiles, appreciating this old man's big life. 
JACOB (CONT'D) And then before you know it, the kids are borrowing the car and moving out. Marlena and I on our own again...until she passed. This moment causes Jacob to pause. He still loves her. 
JACOB (CONT'D) I never told Marlena it was Rosie who got August. I didn't want her to know. When Rosie passed on, she cried for days. I owe that bull my whole life...my kids, everything.. A KNOCK. Charlie peeks through the window and sees a COP: 
CHARLIE It's the heat.

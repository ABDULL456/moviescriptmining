DAVID Ms. Bloom. I'm an anti-death row activist on death row. Doesn't that strike you as odd? 
A beat. She nods. 
BITSEY Any ideas who 'they' are? 
DAVID No. 
A beat. 
DAVID But I have someone on it, someone I'm hoping will one day find an answer. 
BITSEY Belyeu's hired a detective? 
He shakes his head. 
DAVID A journalist. 
It takes Bitsey a second to understand. David smiles. 
DAVID (mimicking Belyeu) 'She's a smart one.' 
ACCELERATED ROTATING ZOOM OUT TO LONG SHOT.

WHITE. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. U.T HALLWAY - LONG SHOT - DAY 
ACCELERATED ROTATING ZOOM IN. 
David and Constance stand by the double doors. He's concentrated; she's biting her lip. They're looking onto a large parking lot. 
The lot is practically empty except for Sharon and Chase, who stand near their Jeep. It's packed with various household items, things not entrusted to movers. 
CONSTANCE I'll drop by your office after. 
He nods and goes out. 
EXT. U.T. PARKING LOT - DAY 
As David approaches them, Chase runs to them -- still carrying Cloud Dog. He jumps on his dad. 
CHASE Wear me like a fur, Daddy! Wear me like a fur! 
As he walks, David drapes the boy sideways over his shoulders (like a fur). Chase squeals with pleasure. 
DAVID Who's your hero? 
Chase bonks him on the nose. David sets Chase down when he reaches his WIFE. He kiss him goodbye as the boy struggles to move on to something else. A long beat as David and his wife stand uncomfortably. 
DAVID Call me when you get to Boston? 
SHARON (WIFE) Yeah. 
A beat. 
DAVID I wish you -- 
SHARON Don't. 
She turns and walks to the Jeep. The door's open. 
SHARON Chase, get in, Sweetie. 
Chase climbs in, sits in the driver's seat. 
CHASE (turning to his dad) See ya later, Alli-gator. 
DAVID After awhile, Crocodile. 
CHASE Take it easy, Japa-ne-se. 
DAVID Okey-dokey, Artichokey. 
SHARON (to Chase) Scoot. 
Chase scoots over to the passenger seat. Sharon gets in the driver's seat. 
SHARON I sent you an e-mail. 
DAVID Okay? 
SHARON Just read it. 
She closes the door. Suddenly, Chase opens the passenger side door, runs around the Jeep carrying Cloud Dog. He runs to his dad, hugs him one last time.

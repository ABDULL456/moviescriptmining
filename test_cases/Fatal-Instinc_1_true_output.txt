LOLA Lola Cain. 
Laura sets the heavy load of books on the desk and steps toward Lola, extending her hand. Lola takes her time removing the long white glove... finally reaching out and shaking Laura's hand with a condescending air. 
LOLA (sarcastic) So lovely to meet you, Laura. 
Ned grabs the books and turns to the bookshelf, replacing each lawbook in its proper slot. 
The "handshake" between Lola and Laura turns tense, then aggressive, eventually becoming a "standing Indian wrestle" as they try to force each other off balance with sheer force. Ned is oblivious to the battle behind him, chattering away. 
NED Gotta keep these darn books in their right place or we'll never find the ones we need. Let's see, Q thru M... R thru B... W thru F... 
Laura suddenly whirls Lola around, putting her in an arm lock. But Lola elbows Laura in the stomach! Laura doubles over. Lola feigns sympathy, taking her hand... then spins, twisting Laura's arm, flipping her head over heels! 
Laura lands on the couch... upside down... gasping. Lola strikes a haughty pose, still holding her lit cigarette. She takes a drag. Laura checks her watch, then tumbles off the couch, landing on her feet. She straightens her skirt. 
LAURA It's getting late. I'll give you a ride home, Ned. 
Finished with the books, Ned turns... smiles. 
NED I have my car. 
LAURA I'll tow you. 
NED Not today. You don't need to wait. I'll see you tomorrow. 
Lola looks at Laura... icy, haughty, triumphant. Laura moves reluctantly toward the door, sees the lock and door frame chewed to pieces... whirls around, heads back toward Ned. 
LAURA I should call someone to fix this... 
NED Tomorrow... 
She instantly spins around, heads back toward the door... 
LAURA I'll call from home. 
...and exits. Ned sits down on the corner of the desk. Lola sits in the chair across from him. 
LOLA I think I should warn you, Mr. Ravine... I'm not wearing any underwear. 
She crosses her legs suggestively... then slowly, enticingly, re-crosses them in the other direction. 
Unimpressed, Ned opens Laura's desk drawer... pulls a pair of sexy lace panties from a Kleenex-style dispenser box labeled "PANDORA'S POP-UP PANTIES"... which pulls another pair up into position. He tosses the panties to Lola. 
NED Try these on. 
She does... very, very slowly and seductively... as they talk. 
NED So... what can I do for you? 
LOLA I've run across some... papers... and I thought you might be able to tell me what they are. You see, I'm not very experienced when it comes to... papers. 
NED I'll help you Miss Cain, if I'm able. Do you have the... papers... here? 
LOLA No... they're at home. I thought you might stop by... 
NED I'm on duty tonight. 
LOLA Don't they ever give you a night off? 
NED Yeah. Tomorrow. 
LOLA (picks up cigarette) Why don't we meet tomorrow evening then? 
She finishes pulling the panties on with a sultry smile... "snapping" the elastic waistband. She goes to the door, pauses... turns to him. 
LOLA I'll let you know where. 
NED (steps over to her) What's wrong with my office? 
She looks around, exhaling another cloud of smoke. 
LOLA Nothing a good interior decorator couldn't fix. 
She opens the door. Behind her, in the hall, we see Dizzy, the saxophone player, wailing away on "Lola's Theme." 
CLOSE ON LOLA 
She takes a final, long drag on her cigarette, then reaches O.S. with it... toward Ned. 
LOLA Take care of this for me, will ya? 
With a sultry smile, she turns and leaves, closing the door. 
ANGLE ON NED 
The cigarette is stuck in his nose. 
INT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The front door swings open. Frank is standing there, dressed in a cheap, loose-fitting suit and a T-shirt.

PHILIP goes over to the television.. 
PRINCE PHILIP I can't watch this. 
ELIZABETH No, wait. Leave it. 
PHILIP stares at the screen.. 
DIANA (ON TV) "Every strong woman in history has had to walk down a similar path.." 
ELIZABETH We encouraged the match. And signed off on it. Both of us. a beat) You were very enthusiastic, remember. 
RINCE PHILIP She was a nice girl. Then. 
DIANA (ON TV) "And I think it's this strength that causes the confusion and the fear." 
PRINCE PHILIP shakes his head.. 
PRINCE PHILIP And I was sure he'd give the other one up. Or, at least make sure his wife towed the line. (a gesture) Isn't that what everyone does? 
A flicker behind the QUEEN's eyes. 
ELIZABETH Is it? 
Her knuckles momentarily whiten. Unaware, PHILIP stares at the television.. 
DIANA (ON TV) "Why is she strong? Where is she getting it from? Where is she going to take it? How is she going to use it?" 
He rolls his eyes in disbelief.. 
PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd) I can't bear it any more. If you're watching, I'll sleep in here. Early start tomorrow.. (kisses her on the forehead) See you in the morning. 
PHILIP goes, leaving the QUEEN staring. Still stinging from his remark about adultery. 
ZAP', she angrily hits the remote. The picture goes black. 
INT. DOWNING STREET - BLAIR'S HOME - NIGHT 
TONY BLAIR and CHERIE at home, watching television. It's 10 o'clock. The KIDS are in bed, but their TOYS are still strewn around the sitting-room. TONY is tidying them up into boxes.. 
ON SCREEN: British historian DAVID STARKEY is lambasting CHARLES. TONY and CHERIE sit on the sofa, watching television, eating pasta on their knees. STARKEY defends the QUEEN. Part of an older generation. She knows no better. 
CHERIE (cont'd) How much of all this could be the first stirrings of.. 
TONY W hat? 
HERIE ..I don't know...something more interesting. Maybe this time people have finally seen them for what they are. 
TONY Which is? 
CHERIE A bunch of freeloading, emotionally retarded...nutters. 
TONY (rolls eyes) That's just absurd. 
CHERIE Why? They exist in a ludicrous cocoon of privilege and wealth. They don't pay tax. 
TONY Yes, they do. 
CHERIE The Queen alone costs us what? Thirty, forty million a year.. 
TONY reaches the door, and turns.. 
TONY ot you, too. Look...if you want to have a serious conversation about this.. 
CHERIE I do.. 
TONY ..about the Constitution.. 
CHERIE e don't HAVE one.. 
TONY ...or about ways in which we as a Government could begin to phase out hereditary privileges, then fine. 
HERIE (indicating plates) If you're going, take the dishes..

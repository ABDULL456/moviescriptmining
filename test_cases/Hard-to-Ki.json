HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - EARLY EVENING \nA modest but handsome home in the foothills above Gower. \nSUPERIMPOSE: \"1983\" \nA young boy, SONNY STORM, rushes out -- excited but pouty and a little peeved. He glowers at a 1981 Mercury, parked at the curb -- then turns back toward the house. \nSONNY (calls back to house) Daddy! I don't want you to go! \nMASON STORM \nemerges from the house -- wearing a dark Gianni Versace sport coat with a black vest underneath, carrying some kind of case in his hand. He looks great -- a man of action, not dandified at all by the snappy attire. He squints down toward Sonny, proudly -- very much the family man. \nMason's pretty wife, FELICIA, appears in the doorway. \nFELICIA (calls to Sonny) Your father has work to do, Sonny ... but he'll be home soon. And we'll all watch it together. \nSONNY You promise, Dad? \nSTORM I promise. \nStorm and Felicia come down to car, his arm around her. Sonny grabs his father's shirtsleeve. \nSONNY Daddy ... (very serious) Daddy, is E.T. gonna win? \nSTORM He's got my vote. \nStorm laughs and ruffles his son's hair. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              2. \nFELICIA (tight to Storm) I want you back early. Tonight's the night those little starlets are crawling all over town. \nSTORM Don't worry. I'll beat 'em off with a stick. \nHe kisses Felicia, ready to leave. \nSONNY Daddy (wants him to stay) What about my joke? \nStorm lifts Sonny up into his arms. He gives the boy 100% of his attention, speaks just for him. \nSTORM Knock knock. \nSONNY Who's there? \nSTORM Old lady. \nSONNY Old lady who? \nSTORM I didn't know you could yodel. \nSonny may not get the joke, but he laughs delightedly -- just because it's his dad telling it. Storm kisses him and sets him down. \nFELICIA (to Storm) Take my advice: Don't give up your day job. \nTITLES BEGIN. \nINT. STORM'S CAR - MOVING - POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD NIGHT \nFreeway traffic. Smoke in the sky ... flames ... the oil refineries south of Torrance. A police RADIO is on, LOW, and we can hear the SQUAWKING COMMUNIQUES in the b.g. \nWe become aware of a black limousine, ahead in the traffic. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 3. \nThe two Shadow Men are obscured by the shack and the position of Calabrese and Vitale. \nSTORM \nStarts his camera soundlessly whirring. He positions his high-tech directional mike, slipping on earphones. \nWHARF - CONSPIRATORS \nThere is NOISE from various wharf MACHINERY on adjacent piers, but the high-tech listening equipment still brings in the sound with acceptable clarity. \nCALABRESE -- Murder is a serious business, my friend. And an expensive one. \nSHADOW MAN WITH HAT You'll be well compensated, Calabrese. Money now -- and a lot more when I get into that office. You can take that to the bank. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               6. \nTHROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS \nDespite the shadows, it's plain the Man With The Hat is in his prime, full of vigor and impatience. Calabrese, by contrast, is clearly older, more circumspect. \nCALABRESE Slowly ... slowly. Always with caution. \nSHADOW MAN WITH HAT I'm up to here with caution! That fuck lives on bean curd and alfalfa sprouts -- he ain't gonna die of natural causes. \nCALABRESE All I'm counseling is a little patience. The man is public. He's in the paper every day. \nSHADOW MAN WITH HAT Yeah? Well, the next time I read about him, it better be in the obituaries. \nON STORM \nHe squints over the camera, straining to see with the naked eve Frustration \nANGLE - CALABRESE AND VITALE \nGlancing to each other. They're tough guys, but in some hard-to-define way, the two Shadow Men are tougher. \nBAREHEADED SHADOW MAN Enough bullshit. Can you do the job or not? If you can't - \nVITALE We'll do it. \nSTORM \nKnowing he's on to something super hot. \nSTORM (to himself, soft but intense) Who are you? Get out of those shadows -- \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              7. \nIt's driving him crazy that he can't make out the Shadow Men's faces. He peers around the wharf, looking for some better vantage point. \nSHACK - CONSPIRATORS \nkeep talking. \nANGLE - STORM \nDarting closer, using the row of bulk containers for cover. He takes up a new position, nearer the shack re-aims the camera. \nLOOKOUT #1 (MIKEY) \nhears something -- peers directly at the spot where Storm is hiding. \nSTORM \nducks quickly back out of sight. As he does this, his earphone cord catches on something. yanking the phone off Storm's head. He cannot hear what the conspirators say next -- but the audience can. \nCONSPIRATORS \nSHADOW MAN WITH HAT The job is a light plane ... a Lear P61. We want it to take off -- we don't want it to land. \nCalabrese becomes aware of Mikey checking out the noise; he motions the conspirators to shut up, then signals Mikey to proceed. Mikey cocks his pistol, moves swiftly toward the line of containers. \nSHADOW MAN WITH HAT \nsteps forward into the light. His face comes clearly into view. Well dressed, magnetic, Bobby Kennedy-ish -- he is L.A. Assemblyman VERNON TRENT. \nTRENT (SHADOW MAN WITH HAT) (to Calabrese, with menace) You told us this dock was clean -- \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 8. \nSTORM'S HIDING PLACE - MIKEY \nSTORM Screw his happiness.

I know we got something here. \nKARL You bringing it in tonight? \nSTORM I promised my kid I'd be home. I'll be at the lab before dawn. \nStorm hangs up. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                11. \nEXT. MINI-MALL - NIGHT \nA crummy mini-mall around Torrance. Storm exits the phone booth -- crosses toward a liquor store, which is still open this late at night. \nINT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT \nStorm enters. A grimy, high-crime booze store.    Not exactly the place to find Mumm's '36. \nSTORM How ya doing? (looking around) Got any champagne? \nThe grizzled MAN behind the counter checks out Storm's Versace threads. \nCOUNTER MAN Right next to the caviar. (winks; points) There's some in the big cooler. \nStorm likes the guy.    He notes the man's MINI-TV tuned to WRESTLING. \nSTORM You're not watching the Oscars? \nCOUNTER MAN The Oscars?    I hate the Oscars. \nStorm crosses to the cooler. \nCOUNTER MAN Who needs the goddam movies? I get it all in here every night. (indicates his view from behind counter) Horror. Sex. Freaks. Violence. And I ain't gotta pay no four bucks. \nStorm pulls a bottle from the cooler. He notices, on a high shelf, a big stuffed toy. Something for Sonny. Storm stretches up, grabs it. Suddenly: \nHe notices something in the big convex shoplifting mirror. Something approaching from outside. \nSTORM (to Counter Man) You got a phone back there? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              12. \nCOUNTER MAN Why ? \nSTORM (orders him) Punch nine-one-one. \nThe Man hesitates, letting a few precious seconds pass. Three Latino PUNKS enter the store. One of them carries a long-barreled shotgun. \nCOUNTER MAN Sonsofbitches! You creeps ripped me off two weeks ago! \nSHOTGUN PUNK Shut up. \nHe gestures to the register. \nCOUNTER MAN Take it, man.   Take my life's savings. \nHe scoops bills from the cash drawer (about twenty bucks) shoves them to the Shotgun Punk. The Punk scowls -- \nCOUNTER MAN Where is a cop when you goddam need one? (to Punks, threatening) I got half a mind to come out there and teach you sonofabitch -- \nShotgun Punk FIRES without warning -- point blank into the counter display and the Man! The Counter Man is BLOWN backwards -- cabinets crash; he crumples, groaning and bloody onto the floor! \nSHOTGUN PUNK Now you got half a mind, old man. \nPunk #2 scoops up the money.   The three Punks saunter up and surround Storm. \nStorm looks down at their feet, then to their faces and smiles. Shotgun Punk points the gun at Storm's face. \nSHOTGUN PUNK What are you grinning at, pindejo? \nSTORM We ... ell ... there's only three of you and you only got one shot left. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                13. \nThe Punks don't know whether to laugh or just shoot him, but it is too late for either option, as Storm suddenly spins between the Punks and behind the gun. \nThe SHOTGUN GOES OFF and BLOWS away part of the back WALL -- BOTTLES EXPLODE -- Storm locks the Punk's fingers into the gun, rotates the gun as a bar, breaking the Punk's arm. \nThe others make their move -- but now Storm has the shotgun and is using it as a sword or staff. He looks like a true master conductor in an almost magical manipulation. These pour stupid Punks have become the instruments in his spontaneous orchestra. \nPunk #2 takes a vicious swipe at Storm with his long knife. Storm ducks, goes to his knees, and uses the gun to foot- sweep the Punk. The Punk's legs fly skyward and his head slams against the floor. As soon as he hits, the shotgun is slammed through his teeth. \nSONNY Is that for me, Dad? \nStorm stops, toy in hand -- \nSTORM You faker. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             16. \nHe comes into the room, sits on the edge of Sonny's bed -- tousling his son's hair with great affection. Sonny takes the stuffed toy sleepily, pulls it into bed beside him. \nSONNY E.T. lost. \nStorm knows E.T. is not just a movie character to Sonny; he's a real person. \nSTORM Who won? \nSONNY I dunno.   Candy. \nSTORM Candy? \nFELICIA (from doorway) Mahatma Candy. He was a great man. \nStorm moves closer to his son. He sees how much E.T.'s loss has hurt his son, and wants to make it better. \nSTORM (very gently) You know why E.T. lost? \nSONNY Why? \nSTORM Cause they only let grownups vote. If kids had voted -- \nSONNY (cheered by this) -- We would have gave E.T. everything! \nSTORM We would have given him everything. \nSONNY Yeah. \nStorm starts to rise. \nSONNY (wants him to stay) Daddy -- tell me a knock-knock. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              17. \nSTORM You know the rules. (pulls covers up) One joke a day. I have to make 'em last. \nAlready Sonny is most of the way back to sleep.   Storm kisses his forehead -- \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nINSERT - JOHNNY CARSON - 1982 \"TONIGHT SHOW\" \nIn mid-joke behind his famous desk. \nStorm and Felicia forms obscure part of the screen -- standing close to each other, beside the bed. Felicia helps him off with his jacket. \nFELICIA There's blood on your jacket. \nSTORM It's okay.   It's not mine. \nStorm's hands dump his stuff onto the bedside table -- camera, tapes from case, gun. He gathers the glasses, pours champagne. \nFelicia watches her husband. She plainly loves him deeply -- and is held and excited by his contradictions. They come closer together, clinking their glasses, sipping. \nFELICIA If people knew how sweet you are, they'd never be scared of you. \nShe kisses him seductively, unbuttoning his shirt at the collar. Storm still wears the vest. \nFELICIA I'm not scared of you. \nSTORM Maybe you should be. \nFELICIA (closer, increasing passion) Why? Are you planning on doing something to me? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             18. \nSTORM A couple of things crossed my mind, in the car coming home. \nAnother kiss. They get their glasses out of the way, Storm lowers his wife languidly onto the bed. They begin kissing more deeply. Storm helps Felicia slide out of her teddy top; her beautiful breasts rise into the light. Storm begins to kiss them, she moans with pleasure. The lovemaking increases in intensity, Felicia's hand groping to open Storm's pants. He begins to help her, guiding her legs apart -- \nFELICIA (in mid-kiss) Door's open. \nNot missing a beat, Storm grabs a heavy pillow, heaves it -- without looking -- at the door. \nLittle Man is just about to search Storm's vest when he looks up and sees: \nBEDROOM DOORWAY - SONNY \nStorm's little boy stands there, in his Woody Woodpecker pajamas, holding the stuffed toy. He stares in numb horror. \nLITTLE MAN (FORD) \nwithout hesitation pumps his SHOTGUN, aims at the boy. Sonny dashes from the bedroom as the BLAST rips the door behind him! \nSONNY'S ROOM - SONNY \nstreaks to the window, heaves against the sash -- \nHALLWAY - TWO MEN \nBig Man (Dunne) boots Sonny's door open, crashes in -- \nSONNY'S ROOM - WINDOW \nSonny plunges out just as both men OPEN FIRE. They pound ROUND after ROUND into and through the window, blowing GLASS everywhere and ripping the windowframe and half the wall to shreds. An ALARM begins BLARING. The men glance to each other, flee. \nEXT. STORM'S HOUSE - FRONT WALK - NIGHT \nALARM CONTINUING. The men emerge walking swiftly but not running, shotguns tight to their sides. They cross the street to a sedan parked in shadows. Up goes the trunk: in go shotguns, plastic bag with tapes -- and their masks, which they have just torn off. \nINT. SEDAN - NIGHT \nLittle Man whips behind the wheel. He is Jack Ford, an extremely bad hombre we've never seen before. He STARTS the CAR. Big Man in the passenger seat. We recognize him! He is Max Dunne -- the burly man who took Storm's phone call in the police station and passed the receiver to Karl. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 22. \nDUNNE (BIG MAN) Punch it. \nEXT.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - TRACKING SHOT - LIEUTENANT O'MALLEY - NIGHT \nA tall and heavy Irishman, built like a tank, with beautiful baby-blue eyes. \nHe hurries down the corridor, radiating intensity. Several cops with him. They turn a corner into a second corridor. \nO'MALLEY Jesus Christ. \nO'MALLEYS POV - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EMERGENCY ROOM \nJammed with cops, officials, newspeople.     A circus. \nO'MALLEY \nstrides forward into the crush. \nASSEMBLYMAN TRENT AND CAPTAIN HOLLAND \nside by side in the mob scene. We recognize the two Shadow Men from the wharf -- the ones who ordered Storm's murder. Under the glare of a mini-cam lamp, a female TV reporter tries to get Trent to talk. \nTRENT (emotional) knew Storm from when I was City Attorney ... and he was a young homicide detective - (choking back tears) We worked on... cases ... together (can't go on) I'm sorry ... sorry -- \nTrent's grief is so sincere, he himself almost believes it; his aides shield him from the camera, steer him away, in the direction of where O'Malley is. Holland goes the opposite way. The reporter picks up her V.O.: \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                23. \nTV REPORTER (V.O.) That was Assemblyman Vernon Trent, deeply moved by the loss of an officer he knew, (etc.). \nMedics wheel Felicia's body past, one bloody forearm visible beneath the sheet. \nTRENT What makes people do this? (in tears, agony) Will you tell me? Will someone please tell me?!! \nO'Malley watches Trent pass, weeping, escorted out by police and aides. \nAcross the crowd O'Malley spots Captain Holland, who apparently is the man he's searching for. \nO'MALLEY (calls) Holland! Captain Holland! \nIn the general hubbub, Holland doesn't hear -- conferring with some other officers. \nANGLE PAST HOLLAND - EMERGENCY ROOM \nTHROUGH the glass partition, we see doctors and nurses going about their examination of Storm's body. \nCLOSE - STORM \nThe man could be dead, but the reality is he has survived and still lives. \nQUICK FADE TO: \nMONTAGE - WITH SCORE \nA) L.A.

She barely pays attention as Andy comes up, starts unloading her stuff. \nMARTHA You're early again. \nANDY (deadpan) You won't report me, will you? \nAndy gulps from Martha's coffee cup.

I almost shit! \nThe nurses laugh. But Andy's glance toward Storm's bed is full of deep care and hope. \nINT. COMA WARD - CLOSE ON STORM - LATER \nChanged in seven years, softer. His shaggy    hair is manicured in a sleeker, longer length and he   wears a smartly short, perfectly trimmed beard.

He's heading back -- frustrated, angry out toward the hall when... the elevator BELL DINGS. \nAT ELEVATORS \nStorm struggles to push himself inside. Everything an excruciating effort. The doors slap into his litter, trying to close. Reopen. Close. Reopen. Hindering him as he throws a look toward -- \nINT.

Her view into the coma room suddenly brings the realization that Storm's bed is still gone. \nSTORM'S ELEVATOR \nThe doors open -- revealing   a dark, deserted seventh floor still under construction.    He registers the opposing elevator rising his way --   jabbing again at the control panel ... exposed there ...   doors wide open.  Wild stabs. Any button will do -- just   close the goddam door! \nDING! Ford's ELEVATOR arrives. Doors open. We make out the killer's form -- just as Storm's doors close. \nStorm blows huge relief. Looks to see what he finally pushed ... Shit! -- the 3RD FLOOR button. He puts the mop to the side wall and shoves himself with all he's got.  The gurney wheels around and places him right next to the control panel. Storm twists onto his side and slams a hand over the EMERGENCY STOP button. But the button jams! And Storm's thrusting hand has pushed his gurney even farther away! He can't reach it! \nHe feels the elevator about to stop at a floor ... claws at the mop, as a weapon ... raises it with all his feeble strength.

She watches for several moments as Storm, weak but on his feet, holds on to the kitchen counter. He steps out, in wobbly balance. Not too good at first, he tries again. This time he does better, but not by much. He turns to look at Andy, conscious of her look of sympathy. \nSTORM (re: himself) That bad ... huh? \nShe silently hands him a set of newspaper photocopies. He glances at them... at her ... and understands. \nANDY I'll be in the other room. \nStorm slowly seats himself and begins to read. \nINSERT - NEWSPAPER PHOTOCOPIES \nOne headline: \nOFFICER SLAIN IN ALLEGED SCANDAL DRUG DEAL FALLOUT SUSPECTED \nSecond headline with photos of Storm, Felicia, Sonny: \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                48. \nPOLICEMAN, FAMILY SLAUGHTERED \nCLOSE - STORM \nBattling his sorry and grief. \nLIVING ROOM AND KITCHEN - ANGLE - ANDY \nShe can see Storm in this moment of agony. \nINT.

When it's deep enough, he places the boards down into the hole and begins to fill it in, packing the earth tightly. He goes to the top of the boards and around them wraps a length of old hemp rope. Around and around. The boards stand up about six feet high. Storm steps back, observes the height, taps it lightly testing the recoil tension. Now he begins to punch it, harder and harder.

RETIREMENT HOME (REDONDO BEACH) - DAY \nAndy gets out of her car in a sunny parking lot. She's wearing dark glasses and a big floppy hat, so we can barely see her face. She passes a sign: \"REDONDO BEACH RETIREMENT VILLA.\" \nINT. RETIREMENT HOME - OFFICE - DAY \nAndy sits across from the Old Lady from the phone call. A plaque on the desk reads: \"HENRIETTA WADE.\" Both she and Andy look frustrated, irritated. \nANDY Mrs. Wade, I'll be honest with you -- I'm not from the police pension board. My name is Andrea Simpson, I'm a nurse from U.C.I. Medical Center. \nThe Lady listens skeptically, revealing nothing.   We see that she is in a wheelchair. \nANDY You probably have no connection to this, and what I'm about to say (MORE) \nShe looks at him. She has a good idea what's tormenting his mind. She reaches her hand, gently touches his shoulder ... \nStorm pulls back. \nSTORM Please. \nHe gets up, backing slowly away from her -- seeing the pain in her eyes, feeling his own pain. In frustration, he slams an elbow punch into a piece of gym equipment -- furiously venting rage! Andy flinches at the sound, the violence. \nSTORM I'm sorry -- (wracked with emotion) Sorry. I -- (MORE) \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                58. \nSTORM (CONT'D) (another furious punch) Why am I still in this fucking cage?! What's wrong with my body? Why won't it heal faster?!! \nHe slams another furious punch.     Andy gets up, tries to approach Storm. \nANDY Mason, please (wants to ease his pain) I love you. \nSTORM Don't say that! \nANDY Why not?! \nSTORM Because I can't love you! Don't you see? It's seven years to anyone else. But it's only days for me. \nAndy draws a sharp, pained breath. \nSTORM How can I be with you ... how can I want you and take you, when -- \nHe can't finish, torn by guilt. He stares at Andy. Suddenly his tone becomes harsh, accusatory. \nSTORM You seduced me. You came in here, looking that way, knowing just what the hell you were doing -- \nANDY (defiant) Yeah, I knew. What of it? I wanted you -- \nSTORM You have no right to want me! \nANDY Then who does?!     I've risked my life for you -- \nSTORM Who asked you to? Not me! \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              59. \nANDY You haven't stopped me! \nSTORM Then don't risk it! Don't do shit for me! I don't need you! \nFor a second it look's like he's going to strike her. Instead he kicks the tray and GLASSES -- which smashes into the floor-to-ceiling MIRROR, SHATTERING like a bomb? \nAndy glares at him, stalks for the door -- \nEXT. APUMSTEAD DRIVE - IRON GATE - NIGHT \nAndy's CAR ROARS out the dirt drive past the iron gate. \nINT. ARMSTEAD BEDRROM - NIGHT \nStorm stalks in, slamming the door behind him -- crosses in fury and despair to the desk. On the desktop: the news photo of Felicia, Sonny and himself. \nStorm stares at the photo in agony for a moment, then rips the desk drawer open, rummages fiercely. He finds: keys! \nINT. ARMSTEAD GARAGE - NIGHT \nStorm strides in, punches the garage door button; the door starts to open. He grabs the corner of a dusty canvas cover -- jerks it off an Army-style Jeep. \nEXT.

CEMETERY - NIGHT \nThe Jeep parked at the edge of a cemetery road. \nSTORM \nstands in the midst of the graveyard, staring at -- \nTHREE TOMBSTONES \nIn the light from the road lamp, we read the names: FELICIA STORM...

The old lady was his mother. (beat) And Andy ... my son's alive. \nAndy raises her face to Storm's, her eyes welling with emotion. He kisses her. They are standing there, just inside the front door, which has a wood bottom-half and a frosted-glass top-half. Suddenly: \nStorm jerks Andy sideways into the room with all his strength! He dives with her as - \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               68. \nThe TOP of the FRONT DOOR EXPLODES inward in a SHOWER of flying GLASS! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Three more point-blank SHOTOGUN BLASTS BLOW the rest of the DOOR to hell. \nANGLE - HALLWAY \nStorm hurls Andy so hard and fast it looks like she will land in pieces. He somehow ends up in front of her on the floor as a masked man plunges through the front door into the hallway, shotgun spinning to cover his advance. Too late. \nWe hear TWO LOUD ROUNDS and the masked man's head snaps violently back and he falls into a pile. \nEXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - DAY \nJones and   Ford pull masks over their faces and sprint for the other   doors. Both carry assault rifles. An enormous powerful   third man (Joe Bear), his mask already in place, vaults to   low balcony, hauls himself up to a second story window --   his huge Bowie knife glinting in the sun. \nINT. HALLWAY - STORM AND ANDY \nhurry toward a staircase, their attention focused behind them -- on the first floor. \nINT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - INTERIOR BALCONY \nJoe Bear waits concealed at  the top of the stairs, on an interior balcony overlooking  the living room, atrium-style. Through the mouth opening of  his ski mask, we see he is smiling a sick smile -- and  sensually stroking his Bowie knife. \nANGLE - TRACKING - STORM \nStorm and Andy scramble up the staircase onto the atrium balcony and out steps Joe Bear with his knife and his smile. \nJoe Bear, for the first time in his life, is surprised when Storm smiles too. Joe Bear screams like an animal and lunges with his knife. \nStorm stabs out his left arm like a spear and tilts his body ever so slightly, then clamps Joe Bear's wrist with his right hand. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                69. \nAllowing his tremendous momentum to culminate like a hurricane, Storm manipulates him in a full circle, catapulting Joe Bear unbelievably into a tall T'ang Dynasty cabinet filled with priceless Oriental artifacts! \nLIVING ROOM \nFord and Jones, masked, hurtle into the living room, just below the atrium balcony. They raise their automatic weapons, but before they can fire -- \nSTORM \nhurls Joe Bear's massive body down upon the attackers! Jones takes the tonnage head-on and is crushed beneath it! Ford dodges, unleashes a burst of AUTOMATIC FIRE straight up at the balcony. Storm shoves Andy to safety onto the exterior balcony and dives there himself, just as the whole interior balcony is RIDDLED by Ford's BULLETS! \nFord bolts for the staircase, coming after Storm. Storm, crouched around the corner on the exterior balcony, waits till Ford hurtles INTO VIEW at the top of the staircase. Storm FIRES his .45 furiously ... Ford springs back, Storm's BULLETS BLAST the staircase WALL to ribbons. His .45 CLICKS empty! \nEXT. BALCONY - STORM \nrips a magazine from his pocket, slams it into the butt of his .45, reloading. He has it half-raised when: \nFord appears -- right in his face, assault rifle leveled at Storm's guts. Storm strikes an instantaneous blow, sending the rifle flying. In one motion, he pinwheels Ford over his head, sending him flying off the exterior balcony and crashing down into the Oriental fountain below! \nEXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - BALCONY AND FOUNTAIN \nStorm swings down to the ground. Andy leaps into his arms, he breaks her fall and helps her alight safely. \nHe reaches to Ford in the fountain, rips the mask off his face. \nHe recognizes the man. \nSTORM I know this fuck.

HOUSE - FRONT WALK - DAY \nAndy making Storm put the gun away. \nANDY Goddamit ... for once, do something the non-violent way! \nStorm is reacting to the sight of his old home -- the first time he's seen it since the slaughter seven years ago. He struggles with his pain and rage. \nAndy, aware of his turmoil, takes his hand. Her hair is done up in a businesslike style; she wears a jacket and carries a briefcase. They cross to the front door -- \nINT. STORM'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DAY \nA pleasant, chatty (and very pregnant) HOUSEWIFE speaks through the open door to Storm and Andy. Sounds of HAMMERING, ETC. in other rooms O.S. \nHOUSEWIFE -- Gee, my husband and I aren't really thinking about selling. In fact, we're adding a nursery -- \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              74. \nANDY Oh, that's the best time for us to see it! Then when you do come to sell, our office will know the upgrades you've made and we can market your home more effectively. \nTwo plasterers troop past, a carpenter with them. \nHOUSEWIFE Hell, come on in. Everyone else does. \nStorm and Andy enter. Andy immediately begins to steer the Housewife away from the kitchen, into the living room. \"Oh what a cute place! \nI'd love to see what you're doing with the nursery...\" \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nStorm casually lingers behind, drifting into the kitchen. He crosses immediately to the alcove where, seven years earlier, he stashed the camera case. \nBut the spot has been remodeled!   There's a new wall there! \nSTORM New wall ... fucking yuppies! \nWithout hesitation, he slams his fist through -- \nWALL \nBang! Gypsum wallboard splinters, revealing a fake panel of brick adjacent to a real brick wall, six inches behind the new wallboard. Storm reaches into the hole, yanks out the camera case. He shakes his sore knuckles from the blow as: \nHOUSEWIFE AND ANDY \narrive from the living room. The Housewife stares in shock at this strange man -- with his hand halfway through her new wall. \nHOUSEWIFE (very cool) Just checking for termites He tucks the camera case under his arm -- takes Andy by the elbow. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               75. \nSTORM (to Housewife) Better have this place fumigated -- quick. \nHe leads Andy out -- crisply, businesslike.

Suddenly Storm slows -- \nANGLE ON ESPOSITO \nas Max Dunne moves INTO FRAME seizing Esposito -- subtly, not drawing any attention. Another man in a suit reinforces Dunne from the other side. Esposito shows terror, but no surprise. Clearly the men have had the drop on him for several minutes -- but there was nothing he could do about it. Dunne's posture indicates he has a concealed gun pressed to Esposito's ribs. \nDunne and Storm make eye contact.    The message is clear: Try anything and Esposito dies. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               79. \nAs Dunne and the other man hustle Esposito from the plaza -- \nANOTHER SECURITY-TYPE IN SUIT \nmoves into Storm's peripheral vision. Coat over his arm, concealing a short-barreled automatic weapon. \nSECURITY-TYPE Someone wants to talk to you, Storm. \nThe man gestures with his coat arm.   Storm's eyes follow to: \nSTORM'S POV - PARK BENCH - TRENT \nThe Senator himself. Big, as life and cool as a cucumber. Alone and unrecognized on a bench, shelling and munching from a bag of peanuts. Behind him: a caged vulture. \nANGLE - PARK BENCH \nas Storm MOVES INTO FRAME.    He stops, standing above Trent. \nTRENT What a day, huh? Beautiful!

Take a load off. \nStorm glances to the coat-over-the-arm-man, who has taken up a subtle position about twenty feet away. \nAfter a beat ... Storm sits. \nTRENT You do have the film somewhere, I assume? \nStorm's hard look says yes. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             80. \nTRENT Developed yet? \nSTORM Still in the camera. \nTRENT Good.

Sonny flops onto his back atop the tall equipment box, kicks up hard -- the hatch pops open! \nANGLE - ROOF OF EQUIPMENT ROOM - SONNY \nclimbs out onto the \"roof\" of the room. He sees a short catwalk leading to the huge, high wall of the dynamo room. Against the wall are big windows. \nSonny scoots to the windows, which are cracked open awning style.

We see the cabbie shouting after him -- and Sonny arguing, gesturing toward the nursing home. \nMrs. O'Malley emerges from the nursing home wheelchair. Sonny rushes to her ... they embrace joyfully. \nO'Malley comes out too, more cautiously than his mother. He is armed. He also hurries to Sonny, hugs him tight. \nSONNY Malley! \nO'MALLEY It's okay, sport. It's okay... it's okay -- \nStill hugging Sonny, O'Malley shoves a bill at the cabbie. Whatever it is, the cabbie is thrilled. He boogies off ecstatically. \nINT.

Suddenly Storm grabs the cop with the badge in front of his face and uses him as a human battering ram for him and Andy to escape, plunging the man through two layers of glass windows of the adjoining Hertz rental office and out into the street in front of the hotel! Andy follows through the newly formed exit. People scream. Chaos. The other cops react in pursuit of Storm and Andy. \nEXT. CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT \nStorm dumps his \"battering ram body\" and he and Andy sprint toward the valet booth at the main entrance of the hotel, where numerous cars are coining and going. \nVALET AREA \nThe valet is a big fat man in a red Beefeater costume. He is presently handing keys to a large \"good old boy\" -- boots, ten-gallon hat and all.

But almost equally as fast, two cop cars start to close in on him. It looks like Storm is trapped! But he slams the pedal to the metal and blasts between them, escaping.

The 11:10 to Albuquerque leaves on track 12. \nThe waiting area is quiet at this time of night except for a few travelers and stragglers. \nSonny Storm, quiet and apprehensive, focuses on tearing open the packet of mustard for his hot dog. He sits on top of a battered suitcase. \nO'Malley returns with the tickets and sits next to Sonny on a bench. \nO'MALLEY Be careful you don't get any    of that guck on your sweater ...    let me comb your hair before your    old man gets here, it's stinking    up in the back. \nO'Malley takes a comb out of his jacket pocket. \nSONNY Quit it, will you ...    you're making me more nervous than    I am already.

Sonny pushes the comb aside. \nO'MALLEY I think I'm more nervous than you are, kid. We got out of my mother' place about two shakes ahead of the landlord ... know what I mean? \nSONNY My dad'll get 'em. You guys'll nail them all.

His plan is to try to make it out of the house in one piece. What was once careful stalking has turned into panicked blundering. \nCONTINUE TRACKING Holland as he bumps into things, knocking them over, retreating wildly. He passes a raging fireplace and suddenly out of the shadows comes a voice: \nSTORM (O.S.) How does it feel to know you're about to die? \nHolland FIRES in the direction of the voice, and Storm comes out of the shadows standing in plain view -- his .45 pointed at Holland. \nSTORM I'll give you more time than you and Trent gave my wife. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                98. \nHolland changes the point of his aim and FIRES again.    As he fires, Storm EMPTIES his GUN straight at Holland. \nWALL BEHIND HOLLAND \nA Louis XIII portrait -- where a silver dollar-sized group of holes has just appeared, two inches above Holland's head. They are both out of ammo. \nSTORM'S POV \nHolland picks up a fireplace poker. He's swinging like maniac and we hear the sound of the poker SLASHING the AIR. \nBut he gets too close to Storm, who snatches the poker away from him. \nThey are like two vicious cats whirling. We see Holland gasping in agony and hear the sound of BONES BREAKING. \nStorm then begins the search for Trent. He casually strolls through the house calling as if he's playing hide and seek with a childhood friend. \nSTORM Vernon, oh, Verrrrrnon, where are you? \nStorm opens closets, looks in drawers, under the toilet seat, and then proceeds into -- \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM \nSTORM (loud enough for Trent to hear) Let's see ... where could that bad boy be? \nFrom the tragic violent rage to what almost seems like a kiddie game, we are not sure if: Storm has gone mad or what. He approaches the master closet as he continues the taunting melody. \nMASTER CLOSET \nStorm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks aside -- looking for something that's probably not there. Trent is too smart for this shit ... he's probably on a jet to the Bahamas by now. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             99. \nOne more rack of clothes in the farthest-back section. Storm reaches to shove it aside when, with shocking and deafening suddenness: a SHOTGUN BLAST erupts point-blank ... shredding $10,000 worth of suit jackets and barely missing Storm's head. Instantly a figure leaps out. Storm gently disarms him, and the two men are for a moment frozen eye to eye. \nSTORM AND TRENT \nStorm seems to drift off somewhere far away, and then violently slams Trent up against the wall, pinning his chest with the left hand. Storm takes the sawed-off shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight into Trent's mouth. The barrel simply goes through the teeth and in his mouth. It appears Storm has made up his mind about what to do. Trent's eyes bug out of his head. \nStorm now takes Trent by the hair and leads him through the house, shotgun still in his mouth. \nSTORM You know, Trent, I want to kill you so bad I can barely contain myself. But I keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you, and that a nice petite white-bread boy like you in a federal penitentiary ... (pause) -- let me put it this way -- I doubt whether you could remain anal retentive for very long. Yeah... I think that's best for you -- \nTrent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about to go out of his mind. About this time in their journey through the house, Storm has stopped before Holland's mangled and lifeless body. If you think Trent was scared before, you should see him now. \nStorm curiously turns his back on Trent for a moment, to pick up handcuffs off the floor. Trent sees his last chance. \nTrent seizes the poker and does his most mighty Babe Ruth impression. Just as Storm stands up, the poker comes flying. It looks like Storm is dead but somehow he steps inside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms Trent and flips him backwards head-first into the fire. \nTrent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron arrows of the fireplace. He is stuck -- struggling to free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire ... a fate somewhat worse than prison. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              100. \nStorm turns away -- \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nEXT.

Behind all of them is a hearse, being nobly escorted by  mounted police. \nFULL SHOT \nNow we see them fully: the colors, the feeling, the emotion of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen comrade. \nCAMERA PAN'S OVER to reveal a section of mourners -- mostly police but with some civilians. The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER and PANS TO the front row, where we see Storm in full police regalia, a medal of valor around his neck.

Your charts go back for seven years. \nSTORM (staggered) Seven... years? \nHe can't absorb this.   It's too much.   His mind reels. \nSTORM Who ... who knows I'm awake? \nANDY (innocent enthusiasm) It's all over the hospital. You're the first one that's come out of a coma of this duration. You'll probably be on the news! (beat) You'll be famous! \nSTORM (struggles to sit up; fails) Listen to me carefully -- (reads her name tag) -- Andy. I don't have the strength to talk much.

Listen to me - \nANDY I'll have one of the aides take you down the hall for hydrotherapy. It'll help you relax. \nSTORM No -- \nANDY Listen... I've got work to do.

His body collapses in a heap there in the entry. \nINT. THIRD-FLOOR CORRIDOR \nDanny wheels Storm through the big swinging doors.

Danny sprawls onto the floor, dead. \nINT. CLOSE ON STORM \nDoesn't need to see to recognize that sound. He gropes at once for the wall corner, trying to propel his litter back through the swinging doors and out of sight. \nStorm strains for it, his limbs maddeningly uncooperative ... stretching, pawing ... until -- he claws far enough to reach where the janitor's mop rests against the wall. \nCOMA WARD - HALLWAY - FORD \nsteps into the hallway, peering up and down -- just as Storm slides out of view. The killer grabs Danny's body by the ankles, to drag it back out of sight. Just then: \nANDY \nbacks   through the double doors at the other end of the hall,   trying to balance an overloaded tray of supplies she's   carrying. She and Ford are momentarily in full view   of each other ... but backs turned. Suddenly -- Ford   hears Andy!

Try a few weeks. \nStorm braces against the cane, ready to try to stand. Andy gets up, to catch him. This infuriates Storm's pride. \nSTORM You helped me, okay? I'm grateful. But every day you keep helping puts you in more danger. \nANDY (deadpan) Danger is my middle name. \nThis is no joke to Storm. \nSTORM I've been dead, Andy.      You wouldn't like it. \nHe tries to get up.    Andy stops him. \nANDY Hey, hey -- I don't think you get the picture here.

First step -- okay. Second -- okay. Third -- blam! The cane slips and he falls flat on his face. Too weak to break the fall. \nLOW ANGLE - STORM \nWe see his face on the carpet and a mean desperate conviction in these eyes not to fail and not to give up. He struggles to rise -- it is pitiful. He's on his knees growling with effort. Cane propped up, he manages to somehow stand again. One step ... two steps ... three, four ... he's absolutely exhausted. Boom! Falls flat again. \nANOTHER LOW ANGLE \nStorm's face on the floor. \nEXTREME CLOSEUP \nFury, frustration, despair -- \nANDY \ngrabs his arm and helps him back onto the couch. She exits the room and comes back momentarily with a bowl of rice and begins to try to feed him. Of course he takes the fork away and tries it himself, but by now his arms are so fatigued from the previous strain that they shake, his hand trembles and he misses his mouth -- getting the rice all down his beard. Spilling a little too much to ignore and at first it looks like he's going to explode. He looks up at Andy, who looks so sad. \nStorm breaks out laughing and so does Andy.

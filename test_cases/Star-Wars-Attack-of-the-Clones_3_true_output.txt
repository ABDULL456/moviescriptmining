EXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. ANAKIN rids the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes. In one shot, he stops and looks down at some tracks. Then he starts up his speeder and rides off. 
EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT The lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close by, a night animal HOWLS. 
EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT PADME is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the animal HOWLING nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard. 
INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD - GARAGE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT PADME stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage. Short silence. Then: 
C-3PO Please don't leave us, Miss Padme. These people need your help. 
THREEPIO is parked in a corner. 
PADME I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just can't sleep. 
C-3PO That's something I cannot relate to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm either active or inactive. There's no in-between. 
PADME I guess you're lucky. 
C-3PO Do you really think so..? I suppose I shouldn't expect... 
PADME You're not happy here? 
C-3PO Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my masters here ar so kind I wouldn't wish to trouuble them, it's just... being like this... well, it's embarrassing. 
PADME Being like what? 
C-3PO Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see, when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. It's so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing? 
PADME I guess I wouldn't like it at all. 
C-3PO Of course you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's simply not protocol. 
PADME looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal and tools. 
PADME Maybe we can do something about it. 
C-3PO I don't think so. Only Master Annie... 
PADME Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here. 
C-3PO Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padme. Of course, I'm just not mechanically minded... if you see what I mean. 
PADME picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him. 
PADME Let's see, if we put this... here... 
C-3PO Ooooh! That's tickles. 
PADME You'll have to be quiet, Threepio. Hold still, please. 
EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS A huge chunk of rock tumbles slowly through the asteroid bely. CAMERA CLOSES, to discover Obi-Wan's Starship hidden in a blasted-out area on the pitted back side of the great rock. 
INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS OBI-WAN looks out toward Geonosis and sees in the distance a large fleet of Trade Federation Ships hidden among the asteroids. He starts the engines of his fighter. 
Obi-Wan's Fighter moves out from the back side of the asteroid and heads away from the asteroid field, descending toward Geonosis. 
EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT Obi-Wan's ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of a rocky ridge. He maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands. He gets out of the Fighter and walks onto the mesa. The wind whips at him. He looks around. 
Geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains. 
The night is quiet, except for an occasional WEIRD CRY. OBI-WAN checks his bearings, then heads away. 
EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT OBI-WAN climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard close by. OBI-WAN stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness. 
OBI-WAN listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it. 
He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering fangs! The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up. 
A SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around and cuts it in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING. It plummets to its death hundreds of feet below.

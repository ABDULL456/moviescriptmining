VALKA Come here. SMITH returns the stare, then slowly approaches. 
VALKA (CONT'D) Take off your coat. A silence, the criminal gang sensing a showdown. There's something about SMITH, something steely, unpredictable. The fire crackles loudly. SMITH all the while holding VALKA's stare. 
[THE DIALOGUE RETURNS TO RUSSIAN.] 
VALKA (CONT'D) Worth shit! He looks at SMITH's companion. 
VALKA (CONT'D) You. ANDREI goes pale, removes his coat to reveal a decent- looking patterned wool sweater. He offers the coat. 
VALKA (CONT'D) Let's have the sweater. 
ANDREI Take the coat. 
VALKA I want the sweater. ANDREI doesn't move. 
VALKA (CONT'D.) (CONT'D) Your babushka make it for you? Come on, hand it over. 
ANDREI is visibly shaking. 
(CONTTNTTFD ) 
3 CONTINUED: (4) 3 
ANDREI You have no authority, here. VALKA gets up, moves slowly to ANDREI, a smile on his lips. Then he casually reaches down as if to tuck his trousers deeper into his boots, reaches for something, and in one slow balletic movement, swings up and stretches out his hand to ANDREI, and ANDREI sobs and leans to one side. 
BOHDAN Was that really necessary? In the dim light ANDREI's face is grey as he sags to the floor. None of the other prisoners move to help him, nor do they show any sign of concern, as VALKA places the knife back in his boot and returns to the game. YURI steps forward and strips the sweater from the dead man, handing it on to VALKA, who passes it to BOHDAN. BOHDAN examines it professionally, wipes a little blood off his hands. 
BOHDAN (CONT'D) OK. For the sausage. The game resumes. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE UP ON: 
4 EXT. GRAVEYARD, FOREST NEAR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 4 
Freshly dug graves. Close on one of these, stones piled in a mound over the grave. Hands into frame moving aside the stones. Wider to see two PRISONERS, breath steaming from their mouths, as they work quickly and quietly to uncover the grave. The older of the two is KHABAROV, late thirties, the other, LAZAR, late twenties. Furtive looks over their shoulders as an occasional blade of light from the watchtower throws them into silhouette. 
KHABAROV Here he is. He reaches out to touch a human toe poking out of the rocks. As they work - Close on the face of ANDREI, as they continue to uncover his body.

4 CONTINUED: 4 
KHABAROV (CONT'D) He's not frozen yet, that's lucky. The remaining stones are removed to find the corpse dressed in nothing but underwear. 
LAZAR Damn! Picked clean! Bloody thieves. 
KHABAROV Keep your voice down, be grateful there's anything left. They reach into the grave to retrieve the underwear. 
A5 OMITTED AS 
AB5 INT WASH-HOUSE - NIGHT AB5 LAZAR's hands in water, some kind of tin sink, water running red as the underwear is rinsed clean of blood. 
5 EXT. BARRACKS, CAMP 105 - DAWN 5 
A Soviet guard beats a hammer against a hanging length of iron. 
6 INT. BARRACK BUILDING - SAME TIME - DAWN 6 
Close on the barrack stove, the underwear drying, KHABAROV's hands into the frame. As the prisoners rise, follow a hand to hand exchange of the set of underwear for a hank of tobacco. KHABAROV having done the deal splits the tobacco with LAZAR. Moving quickly to complete a second deal, KHABAROV swaps half his share of the tobacco with another prisoner for two slices of bread. He waits until the last of the men leave then he carefully breaks off a corner from one piece of bread, concealing the rest in a hiding place in the dirt at the base of his bunk - a glimpse of a cache of hoarded food and other items. 
6 CONTINUED: 6 The saved morsel he places on his tongue, and closes his eyes. He doesn't chew, just lets it dissolve like the Eucharist. Then it's gone in a slow swallow and he opens his eyes. He can hear a guard shouting outside, but he hesitates, carefully licking his fingers. He stares at his hand. Close on a spot between his fingers - there's a crumb there. Into frame, the tip of his tongue as it slowly and carefully retrieves the tiny speck of bread. 
7 EXT. LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - DAWN 7 
The camp seen in a distant view - surrounded by double wire, a collection of weathered timber buildings with watchtowers placed at regular intervals along the perimeter. In the distance, dense forest. Entering frame a column of close to a hundred men march toward the camp. Following behind is a lorry, carrying six guards, supplies for their recent journey, and a camp stove. 
8 EXT. CAMP GATES - DAWN 8

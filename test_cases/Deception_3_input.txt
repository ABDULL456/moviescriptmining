SAME SCENE - SHORT TIME LATER Jonathan is standing awkwardly beneath the Eloise portrait, glancing at his watch, growing restless, unsure --

WOMAN'S VOICE                                                    (O.S.) Pardon me, but may I ask you something - personal? Jonathan quickly looks.up, to find standing before him an attractive BLONDE WOMAN. She's. around his age, slender to the point of stark, dressed in a chic grey business suit. 
THE BLONDE Are you waiting for me? 
JONATHAN I                                                                - think so, yes. You're here for Wyatt, right? 
THE BLONDE Excuse me? (hesitates, appraising him) I'm sorry, did we speak earlier? 
JONATHAN Yes. Yes we did - 
THE BLONDE Good. Let's go then. 
INT. PLAZA - ELEVATOR 
Jonathan and the Blonde stand in an elevator alongside an ELDERLY COUPLE. The couple smile at the handsome pair. Jonathan fidgets uncomfortably. The Woman is staring at the lit numbers. He notices a ROOM KEY in her hand. 
JONATHAN (whispers aside) Look, I don't think I'm -- I mean; you and I., we don't know each other...? She turns to him, the slightest smile on her thin lips. 
THE BLONDE No fooling. DING. The doors open. She steps out. A beat. He follows. 
THE HALLWAY Walls, carpeting - details all classically gorgeous. The Blonde keeps a quick pace, headed toward a room. 
JONATHAN What I mean to say is, I'm fairly certain there's been some kind of mistake. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: She stops dead in her tracks, her back to him. 
THE BLONDE You're not who I spoke with on the phone? 
JONATHAN No - I mean, yes, but - 
THE BLONDE You're not attracted to me? 
JONATHAN Oh no, it's not that at all, it's just                          - 
THE BLONDE It's just what... exactly? She turns, steps toward him. Jonathan opens his mouth to explain -- when she covers it with hers. It takes him a moment to succumb to her kiss... but not too long. 
INT. PLAZA -- A ROOM - LATER 
A smooth plane of pressed sheets creases as two bare bodies lower to them. The Blonde hovering over him, Jonathan's tentativeness is all but gone. Jonathan cradles her to him, her features softening under waves of pleasure as she gasps, and whispers in soft, slow annunciation as if it were the sweetest word in our language: 
THE BLONDE Fuck. LATER: Jonathan lies post-coital. A smile. And then a look of mild anxiety, 'what's going on'? He turns to the Blonde but she's fast asleep. 
INT. PLAZA - THE', ROOM - EARLY MORNING 
On the sound of a DOOR SHUTTING, Jonathan's eyes squint open. Still naked, he props himself up, leans over to find he's all alone. A clock radio reveals itself as the source of the FAINT CLASSICAL MUSIC we hear. The time reads:                  6:18   am. He rises, glances around the room. No sign of her. 
INT. PLAZA - RECEPTION DESK - MORNING 
Showered and dressed, Jonathan is talking with a DESK CLERK. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DESK CLERK Sir, I'm showing that room as having checked out at                                                 6:20                                   this morning. 
JONATHAN Well could you tell me the name of the guest who was staying there? 
DESK CLERK I'm afraid we're not allowed to disclose information regarding our guests. If you give me her name, I can confirm if she was registered here. 
JONATHAN Actually, the thing is... it's okay. Forget it. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - MORNING

EDWARDS A brand new 1958 Edsel! 
The audience applauds. Frances smiles guardedly. 
FRANCES Thank you, Ralph. 
EDWARDS Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel! 
Applause. 
EDWARDS So, Frances Farmer, this is your life. Good night. God bless you. 
The audience applauds. Frances smiles wearily and accepts congratulations. 
EXT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - HOLLYWOOD - DAY 
A group of PEOPLE are coming down the front steps, Frances among them. They all talk happily, Frances is silent but smiling. 
WOMAN Where shall we drop you, Frances? Home? 
FRANCES (vaguely) No... no, someone's picking me up. 
The people all excuse themselves, calling goodbye. Frances waits by herself for a few moments, but soon begins to walk away down the sidewalk. 
HARRY (O.S.) Hey. 
She turns. Harry is leaning against the side of a building, looking much as he did when they first met. But there is very little light of recognition in Frances' eyes. 
HARRY C'mere. I want to talk to you. 
FRANCES (flatly) Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you. 
Harry is a little puzzled by her reaction. 
HARRY How... how ya doin', Farmer? 
FRANCES Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show? 
HARRY Sure I did, that's why I'm here. 
FRANCES (concerned) How did I look? 
HARRY Oh, you... (smiling) ...ennh. 
FRANCES (a glimmer, but she does not pick up on the cue) Well... you're looking well. 
They are both silent a long moment. 
FRANCES I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died? 
HARRY Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that. 
FRANCES Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry... 
HARRY Why do you say that? 
FRANCES I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner. (she smiles) ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but... 
Harry is alarmed now. 
HARRY (taking her by the arm) Frances! 
She angrily bares her teeth; then just as suddenly she relaxes and becomes lucid. 
FRANCES Don't get mad at me, Harry. Please. It's just... Some things happen for the best. 
Beat. 
She takes his hand as if to shake it. 
Harry clasps hers tenderly. 
She holds on like an old woman, stroking his hand. For an instant she gets lost in time, just holding his hand. Then she looks up. 
FRANCES It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry? 
HARRY I'm not sure. 
FRANCES Very slow. (uncertainly) But we're not going to stop, are we? 
HARRY No. 
FRANCES (reassured) No, we're not. 
It is as if she is able to express in words the last remnant of her indomitable will... but the words bear no emotional power. 
FRANCES Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again. 
HARRY Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you? 
FRANCES That would be okay. 
HARRY Just a little way. 
He offers his arm. She takes it. All rather formal. They stroll on together.

INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Wally and Estelle watch the three semi-clothed boys shovel in fried liver with no complaint. 
ESTELLE Wally was a friend of Jerry's. He came to help me in my time of mourning. 
NICK What happened to Lance? Estelle's face registers "none of your business," but a kind look from Wally and she softens. 
ESTELLE Lance is busy training to be a detective. He isn't around as much as he used to be. Nick nods and goes back to eating. 
ESTELLE Mr. Rumpkin is very smart. Ask him a question, Nick. 
NICK Okay. Mr. Rumpkin, what famous actress was married to Frank Sinatra, Artie Shaw, and Mickey Rooney? 
LEFTY Whoever she is, she sure gets around. 
WALLY Ava Gardner. Estelle smiles with pride. Nick and the other boys regard the gentle giant with admiration. He bashfully averts his eyes. 
ESTELLE That's nothing. You should see what he did with the living room. 
INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Nick and the other two boys pause in the doorway. Where once the Chevy occupied the space, the living room was now fairly returned to it's normal uncluttered state with all the furniture placed back in the original positions. At some point Wally must have sawed a hole in the wall shared by the living and dining areas because the Chevy now occupies that hole and has been painted and decorated such that it has achieved an almost seamless blend with the wall. Estelle goes and takes a seat on the couch. 
ESTELLE Go ahead, Wally. Show them. Wally blushes before he flips a switch and the tail lights come on, giving the living room a warm, flattering glow. 
NICK, LEFTY, VIJAY Ooooooh. Wally flips another switch and the car's radio turns on. 
NICK, LEFTY, VIJAY Aaaaaaah. Wally makes a slightly embarrassed gesture of scratching his head before lumbering over to the couch and taking a seat next to Estelle. Nick watches as Wally puts his arm around his mother and they listen to the Chevy play them Elvis' LOVE ME TENDER. The two adults snuggle in the glow of the tail lights and it brings an unexpected rush of caring in his expression. 
EXT. UKIAH - DAY 
The truck rumbles to a stop and the three boys climb out. Nick looks, over his shoulder at Wally blushing behind the wheel of the truck. 
WALLY Well, uhm... It was nice meeting you, Nick. 
NICK You too, Mr. Rumpkin. Wally blushes even more. He closes the door and starts to turn the truck around. Nick watches him go. Wally waves goodbye. Nick turns and the three boys make their way down the dusty road. 
INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY 
Lacey works up a sweat to Billy Blank. Nick comes through the door. He's still in his underwear. 
NICK Where's Dad? 
LACEY In the bedroom. I wouldn't bother him, Nick. He's in a foul mood. He's on with the police. Apparently someone broke in and stole his Beamer. Lacey gives Nick an amused smile. 
GEORGE (O.S.) Lacey! Get in here! 
Lacey rolls her eyes and heads for the bedroom. Nick sits down with Dwayne at the breakfast table. 
DWAYNE Nick, you got a girlfriend? 
NICK Yes, I do. 
DWAYNE If you asked your girlfriend as a favor, would she do it with me? 
NICK Guys don't share their girlfriends. 
DWAYNE I get ya. You're worried `cause your girlfriend might get knocked up. What if I pull out, Nick? Nick seethes inwardly. There comes a ruckus from the back bedroom and Lacey emerges. 
LACEY It's not my fault, you tight-assed, critical, nonfeeling, sexist drunk. 
GEORGE (O.S.) Sticks and stones. It doesn't bother me if you sleep on the couch from now on. 
LACEY Does it bother you that you're a selfish, uptight, boring lover? 
NICK You forgot lousy driver! George appears in the doorway. 
GEORGE That's strike two, jerkoff! Nick hangs his head. George moves about the kitchen chugging from a jug of zin. Lacey picks up the ringing phone. 
LACEY Hello? 
(PAUSE) Thank you. Lacey hangs up the phone. 
LACEY They found your car in Davenport, George. Go pick it up.

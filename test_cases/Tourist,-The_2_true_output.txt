Frank puts one bare foot on the stonework. He grimaces as he HEAVES himself onto the railing of the balcony adjacent to his. 
He hangs desperately, flailing, 100 feet over the street below. He gets a tentative hold... 
A PALLID FRENCH WOMAN drops her coffee and screams. 
The Russians sprint out to the balcony.    They spot Frank... 
Who shoves the Pallid Woman inside, struggles past her breakfast table, and prepares to leap again-- but slips on the spilled coffee. 
Bullets shatter China around him. He cuts his foot on a broken plate. He grabs his bleeding foot. 
FRANK Goddamn it!   I'm a fucking tourist! 
Another round of shots ring out.    They don't seem to care. 
Frank goes over the railing with another awkward HEAVE. 
His pursuers scale the adjoining stone work and step onto the Pallid Woman's balcony. 
This time Frank lands in the lap of a BURLY WELSHMAN. 
BURLY WELSHMAN Are ya bloody mad? 
The Burly Welshman PUNCHES Frank in the stomach, which drops him out of the way of... 
TWO SHOTS 
Which explode into the Welshman's shoulder.   He cries out and falls down on top of Frank. 
The Russians stand on the Pallid Woman's balcony and prepare to JUMP... 
as Frank crawls out from under the wounded Welshman and peers over the next balcony... 
Which is at least TWENTY FEET from the roof. 
He misjudged the distance. 
FRANK Shit... 
INT. THE WELSHMAN'S ROOM - SECONDS LATER 
Frank runs through the hotel room, past the Welshman's wife to the door. 
A SHOT behind him and pounding feet send him out into the corridor past a room service steward to an... 
ELEVATOR 
Which   will not do but the-- 
INT.    SERVICE STAIRCASE - SECONDS LATER 
STAIRS will and Frank flies down the steps, three at a time, hearing his pursuers above him, running harder than he's run in his entire life... 
But he's slow and they gain on him enough to aim weapons through the railing... 
P-CHING, several bullets ricochet like pinballs in the metal stairwell. 
Frank pants as he pushes out a side door... 
EXT. RIO DEL VIN CANAL, VENICE - DAY 
Frank sprints along the edge of the canal, dodging tourists and children, vendors and locals. He spots a VENDOR'S three wheel BICYCLE and jumps on. 
As he pedals, he realizes it's too slow so he JUMPS OFF... 
and FALLS - a painful spill, he cuts his hand - but clambers to his feet as the Russians bear down. Running up hidden stairs he finds the roof of a shop on the Riva Degli Schiavoni... 
EXT. RIVA DEGLI SCHIAVONI, VENICE - DAY 
Frank runs down the ridge of the roof.   A silenced shot hits roof tile nearby and throws him off balance. He FALLS... 
...bumping down the other side of the roof until, as he topples over the edge, he thrusts a hand at the gutter, smashing his head against the wall. He drops onto the pavement along the edge of the small canal. 
He doubles back towards the lagoon. Looking back, he sees the men still in pursuit. 
He turns into the Campo San Zaccaria, scattering the flapping and fluttering PIGEONS.   The Gondolieri and their passengers watch the half-naked man run past and cheer. 
A GONDOLIER (in Italian) Run faster, man! 
The Russians force their way past the pedestrians.    They have almost caught him when...

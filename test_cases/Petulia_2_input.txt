FIRST GENTLEMAN Wonderful. i.sn g t - t ? They sell like hot cakes. Gives you something alive in all this stone. 
ARCHIE There must be some mistake. He sags down on a chair, draped in his research books. The two old gentlemen couldn't be more pleased. 
FIRST GENTLEMAN Mac and I get a, big kick out of people's first reaction. Its not a toy. It's a working greenhouse. You control heat and humidity with these. (he indicates dials) You've got a little bit of everything. Ornamental plants,, Zinnias, Asters. Even a little vegetable garden. The most important thing to remember is to keep the sun out. These new kind of lights work so much better, there's no comparison. 
ARCHIE You've got the wrong apartment l 
FIRST GENTLEMAN 
(CHEERFULLY) No we have not s Dr. Bollen3 
ARCHIE What screwball ...?I Then he stops, He knows what screwball. 
ARCHIE No gift card? 
FIRST GENTLEMAN It might come by mail. Archie starts chuckling. He crosses to the green- house, still chuckling. 
9L. 
95 CONTINUED 
ARCHIE This one heat, and this one humidity, right? 
FIRST GENTLEMAN Exactly. We've left a manual of operations, and wetll check everything out in a month. Okay, Dr. Bollen? 
ARCHIE (still chuckling) Okay, okay! Goodbye,' He enters the greenhouse, having to stoop almost double, as the two old gentlemen exit from the apartment. 
96 INT. GREENHOUSE 
Though extremely uncomfortable, Archie is entirely happy. Suddenly he is ripping up flowers and vegetables to make a kooky bouquet. He is positively exultant. He adds radishes and turnips to the bouquet. This is the happiest we have ever seen Archie. 
97. EXT. DANNER HOUSE DAY 
Archiets car is parked on the cliff. The Danner house is dark, deserted, abandoned. Archie is standing by himself on the wharf bouquet in hand. The yacht has gone. And so has Petulia. Archie feels utterly alone, and as a matter of fact, he is. He tosses the bouquet into the water. The lettuce floats. 
97A EXT. THE YACHT DAY 
Theoretically, we should be at some flea bag port in South America. Mostly, we SEE the yacht. 
97A Continued Petulia is sunbathing on the yacht. She looks much better now. Weeks have passed, she has a golden tan. Beside her, a transistor radio has picked up a local broadcast which would be in either Spanish or Portuguese and which consists mostly of music. David hops onto the yacht carrying a bag of groceries. He, too, is deeply tanned, marvelously healthy, but somehow uneasy. 
DAVID Hi. 
PETULIA Did you get mama on the plane all right? 
DAVID Sure. But what a dinky plane. Poor mamats stomach problems are far from over. He enters the cabin. Petulia sits up after a moment, looks about, sees no one else, then then in alarm peers into one of the windows that looks down into the cabin. 
97B INT. CABIN 
David is stowing food into the refrigerator. 
PETULIA You didn't leave papa alone in that horrible little town? 
DAVID It's not such a horrible little town. (he holds up a can) Hearts of artichokes' 
PETULIA 
(UNEASILY) David... 
DAVID? Take your "Vitamer Zed," you blinkint Limey. 
0 97B Continued He uses the English way of saying "vitamin," and then a bit too rakishly he tosses an orange up through the window. Instinctively, Petulia makes an effort to catch, misses, and it hits her lightly on the shoulder. Though it causes no damage,'David is suddenly in terror. He races up out of the cabin to Petulia.

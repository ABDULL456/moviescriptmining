REY I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it. 
HAN Escape now. Hug later. 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY 
The X-Wings DOGFIGHT with the TIE Fighters on the surface of the snowy planet. INTERCUT BETWEEN the ships SCREAMING past each other, and the COCKPITS of the Resistance and First Order fighters. Poe's fighter NEARLY COLLIDES with a close- passing TIE Fighter! 
SNAP I got one behind me. See it? 
JESS Yeah, I'm on it! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: A heavy cannon emplacement launches a missile that shreds an X-wing fighter. 
JESS Furillo's been hit! 
SNAP Watch out for ground fire! 
EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY 
The X-wings ROAR across the sky, BLASTING and DODGING the TIE Fighters and missiles. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Han, Finn, Rey and Chewie, who run out here, into the snow, stopping, eyes on the sky, watching the lop-sided battle. 
THE FOUR HEROES TURN TO EACH OTHER, RESOLVE IN THEIR EYES. A long moment of communication. 
HAN They're in trouble. We can't leave. (to Finn, re: Chewie) My friend here has a bag full of explosives. Let's use 'em. 
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY 
A Resistance Technician turns to Leia: 
KAYDEL KO CONNIX General, are you seeing this? 
VOBER DAND Two more X-wings down. That's half our fleet destroyed. 
C-3PO And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes! It would take a miracle to save us now. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS 
Han and Chewie arrive here to find THREE SECURITY STORMTROOPERS approaching a Maintenance Hatch. Instantly, Chewie takes out the middle one with his Bowcaster. Han and the other two Stormtroopers OPEN FIRE, but Han's aim is true. 
ALARMS START BLARING! 
INT. JUNCTION STATION - NEAR DARKNESS 
Running inside from a parked snowspeeder, Rey opens a service hatch. Finn behind her, as she reaches into the mechanics of the place, very much like the very first shot we saw of Rey. And she YANKS a piece of TECH from the machinery and: 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS 
The HATCH OPENS! Han and Chewie, having been on the lookout, step inside, weapons poised. Chewie MOANS. 
HAN That girl knows her stuff. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS 
Han and Chewie divide the explosives. Talk in hushed tones. 
HAN We'll set the charges at every other column. He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders. 
HAN (CONT'D) You're right. That's a better idea. (checks his detonator) You take the top. 
(CHEWIE DOES) I'll go down below. Detonator. We'll meet back here. They head off in opposite directions. 
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS 
Han finishes placing an explosive. Checks he's all-clear and hurries down to the next level. Chewie climbs up a level. 
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NEAR DARKNESS 
A SQUAD of Stormtroopers SNAP to alert as Kylo Ren approaches. CONTROLS ARE HIT and the huge DOOR OPENS. Without hesitation, Kylo walks INTO THE OSCILLATOR. 
INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS 
A COLOSSAL CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURE. DARK CORRIDORS and CATWALKS. Kylo Ren comes to a stop. Scans the structure. SENSING SOMETHING, he motions the Stormtrooper Squad upwards. 
KYLO REN Find them. They rush past him. Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN. 
INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS 
The Stormtroopers move up the ramp, weapons ready, checking carefully where blind corners intersect from the perimeter. They come round to the next higher level and PASS CLOSE TO CAMERA. When they've passed, TILT to find CHEWIE, in the shadows of the grillwork.

LINDA What's a toby? 
HARRY You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child. (beat) In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since. 
LINDA I thought you weren't old fashioned. 
HARRY In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X. 
Harry is aware that Babe Brother is interested in the knife. After cleaning his last fingernail, he hands the knife to Babe Brother. 
Harry looks at the cards in his hand. He smiles to himself. 
HARRY Did you have your child at home? 
LINDA No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door. 
HARRY Some folks take that natural stuff too far. 
LINDA Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now. 
HARRY Country people got so many strange ways, 
Harry looks again at the chicken that he is boiling. 
BABE BROTHER Did you ever have to use this thing? 
HARRY That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out. 
Linda picks up a card and looks at it. There is a naked woman on the back. 
BABE BROTHER Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die? 
HARRY I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets. (beat) I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me. 
Sunny is busy playing in the curtains. 
The SOUND of Gideon and Suzie arriving makes them scurry to get the cards put away. Harry puts his knife away just as Suzie and Gideon enter. Linda feels a little embarrassed. 
LINDA How was church? 
Gideon and Suzie are surprised to see Linda. They don't know what to say. 
EXT. MRS. BAKER'S BACKYARD - DAY 
Rodney walks around in the yard BLOWING his trumpet as loud as he can. The SOUND of the trumpet frightens Skip's birds. 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
Gideon is repairing the pipes under the face bowl. Harry is leaning against the door. 
HARRY How often is your wife called to help delivery? 
GIDEON It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home. 
Gideon takes the pipe off. It has rotted. Gideon cannot believe it. 
GIDEON (CONT'D) What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing. 
HARRY Everything these days is made overseas. 
GIDEON You and Babe Brother hit it off so well. 
HARRY Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy. 
GIDEON I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.

MUMBLE (spent) You're welcome. 
ON AN ICEBERG. NIGHT 
The entire sky is ablaze with the shimmering LIGHTS of the AURORA AUSTRALIS. 
The PENGUINS stand below, looking up in wonder. They sing: 
ELLA AND THE OTHERS "Gotta keep those lovin' good Vibrations a happenin' with her, "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh..." 
The HARMONIES are exquisite until... 
MUMBLE (very loud and tuneless) "...Good, Good, Good...Good VibRatiOns..." 
The singing STOPS. 
MALE PENGUINS ...Mumble, ...Knock it off. 
The singing RESUMES. 
ELLA AND THE CHOIR "Gotta keep those lovin' good Vibrations A happenin' with her." 
Another CRESCENDO... 
ELLA AND THE CHOIR (CONT'D) "Ahhh..." 
It's too much for MUMBLE. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MUMBLE "...AaahhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhh..." 
This stops the whole thing dead. ELLA pads over to him. 
ELLA (gently) Mumble, the thing is... 
MUMBLE I know. I know 
ELLA ....It's better if you just listen. 
She returns to the choir. The singing resumes...a perfect harmonic MUMBLE can't help himself. He begins to TAP DANCE. 
ELLA AND THE OTHERS MUMBLE!!! 
MUMBLE (retreating) OK! I'll quit. OK! 
AN ICE-FLOE 
We find MUMBLE on his own small ice-floe separate from the others on their iceberg. 
As their singing drifts across to him, MUMBLE does an exquisite little SOFT-SHOE SHUFFLE. 
TIME LAPSE 
As night slowly pales to a misty dawn and Mumbles lonely floe drifts off, turning slowly in the current 
Music Over: "The tracks of my tears" 
MORNING 
He is woken by A NUDGE at his little raft of ice. 
MUMBLE (sleepily) Woah. Whose there. 
Another nudge.

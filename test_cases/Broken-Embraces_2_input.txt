JUDIT Thank you. I am feeling better... and I'll fall asleep soon. 
DIEGO Call me, if you are not feeling well... 
He kisses her twice and exits. The curtains that cover a large window that looks out into an interior terrace are made from the same material as those that Mateo has in his bedroom. 
168. HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAWN. 2008. 
The next day. Standing over his desk, Mateo searches the desk drawer under the computer. It's open. There are not many things inside (credit cards, envelopes with money, a jump drive, the MP3, etc.), he goes through it meticulously until he finds the note that Ray X had left him the day he came to ask him if they could write a script together. Ray X has hand-written his own telephone number on the note. He goes over it with his fingertips, as if he could see through them. 
He dials a familiar number, Diego's. 
169. JUDIT'S HOME. DIEGO'S BEDROOM. INT. DAWN. 2008. 
Diego's mobile phone vibrates four or five times. But Diego is sleeping and he doesn't wake up. The mobile phone stops vibrating. In all the scenes where Mateo is alone at home, he never turns on the light. He will be in the dark, lightly illuminated by any light that the cracks in the windows let through. 
RETURN TO 168. 
Mateo leaves him a message: "I am sorry to call you so early. Tell your mother to call me as soon as she can." 
170. HARRY'S STREET. EXT. DAY. 2008. 
As usual, Mateo buys his newspaper at the same news-agent. He turns his body toward the Modeling Agency, but no one there enters or exits whose odor or whose clacking heels rings familiar. There are a few people on the sidewalk and those he crosses are all heading, like zombies, to work. 
171. BAR ACROSS. 8 IN THE MORNING. EXT. INT. DAY. 2008. 
He enters the bar where his Waiter Friend works. The place has just opened. There are very few clients. He greets him. 
WAITER FRIEND Why here so early? 
MATEO I couldn't sleep. Would you mind dialing this number? 
He hands him the phone and the piece of paper where Ray X's number is written. 
172. KITCHEN, JUDIT'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008. 
Diego is meticulously preparing breakfast for himself and Judit. He works hard to ensure that they both start their day with the help of a generous and varied breakfast, toast, juice, coffee and tea, marmalade, toasted bread spread with oil and tomato, etc.. Judit appears through one of the kitchen doors, calm, with a look of having rested (but also with the hangover of having survived a nightmarish day, the day before). Diego does not hear her approach. The mother takes advantage of this to observe her son with a tender smile. When Diego turns to look, the tenderness disappears a little, more out of modesty and a lack of habit. In any case, Judit enjoys the peacefulness of the moment: her son caring for her after the storm. Judit looks over the culinary display. 
JUDIT How impressive! 
DIEGO I am specializing in breakfasts. I would do the same for Mateo... 
Judit's expression changes, now a bit more somber. 
DIEGO Are you OK? 
JUDIT Yes, (still a bit beaten down) don't worry about last night. It's horrible, but it only happens occasionally and I know how to stop it... 
DIEGO It scared me, it seemed as though an alien would pop out of your stomach. 
JUDIT 
It's not a bad way of describing a panic attack... (Changing the topic, one can tell she's made the decision before she arrived in the kitchen). Diego, there was one last thing I didn't tell you yesterday. 
Assuming it will be painful, he attempts to dissuade her: 
DIEGO About Mateo? 
JUDIT Yes. 
DIEGO You can tell me some other time. Now it's time for breakfast. 
JUDIT If I don't tell you now, I may never do so... At the end of the eighties, in `77, to be exact. 
DIEGO The year of punk. 
JUDIT Yes, in the year of punk, Mateo and I became involved... 
DIEGO In a love affair? 
JUDIT Yes... We were just getting started in film, and we are still at it, but our love affair ended, at least on his side... That didn't keep us from working together... until now... 
DIEGO I knew all that, or I imagined it... 
JUDIT There's one more thing... Mateo is your father... 
Diego looks at her, astonished. 
DIEGO And that fleeting lover, my supposed biological father? You made him up? 
JUDIT No... I... can hide things... but I never make things up... I don't know how to make up... The fleeting lover existed, he was gay and our affair was short-lived. His name was Vicente and it was while I was with him that you were conceived, but your biological father was Mateo, not Vicente. 
Still thinking about what he has just heard, Diego places the breakfast on the main kitchen table and serves his mother a cup of tea. Judit begins to drink it, one tiny sip at a time. 
DIEGO (Assimilates the news. He is not displeased) Does Mateo know? 
JUDIT No. At that time, he asked me and I denied it, of course. I didn't want to put pressure on him, I didn't want our relationship to change because of it. After all, I had never asked him if he wanted to become a father. 
The pieces begin to fall together. 
DIEGO I see... 
JUDIT

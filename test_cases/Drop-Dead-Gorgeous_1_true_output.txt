SHAKY VIDEO of a 15 year-old rocker KID from the NECK ROCKER KID #1 (Beavis with a MN accent) Yah-dude, put another fuckin' book under it. 
ROCKER KID #2 (O.S.) Don't say "fuckin'." My ma's got the windows open. 
CAMERA MOVES, then steadies.  We see all of Rocker Kid #1.  Rocker Kid #2 runs into the shot with his guitar. 
ROCKER KID #2 (cont'd) kKay-dude, hurry.  We gots like two fuckin' minutes left on the battery. 
ROCKER KID #1 A one...two...one-two-three... 
SUDDENLY Annette's' trailer EXPLODES behind them!  Rocker Kids turn to see a BODY (Annette's) FLY through the air. 
ROCKER KIDS SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!! 
INT. HOSPITAL - ANNETTE'S ROOM 
ANNETTE (to Amber) I shoved your tap shoes in my jeans before I was blown outta the house, Honey.  Check with the guy who cut my pants off.  He should have kem. 
AMBER Mom, uh, about that...I-I'm-oh God... 
Amber starts to cry and runs out. 
ANNETTE Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant! (calling after her) If you are - come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU! 
LORETTA (running after Amber) Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit. 
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Loretta and Amber face off. 
LORETTA You're what?! 
AMBER I-I'm quittin' the pageant. 
LORETTA I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind.  Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart! 
AMBER Oh God, I'm dead... 
A candy striper approaches them. 
CANDY STRIPER Hey, lil' Miss Sad-pants and her friend Serious Sally, how kbout some nice cool mints to turn those frowns upside-down. "S." 
LORETTA (to candy striper) D'ya think a nice cool mint'd help if I shoved your head up your ass? 
Fear sweeps over the Candy Striper - she bolts down the hall!  Loretta puts an arm around Amber and starts to walk down the opposite direction. 
AMBER So, what do I say? 
LORETTA Simple.  Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything - relationships, dreams - your tummy, ass and thighs - all to bring me into this world.  All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant - the same one you were in.  But, y'know what?  I'm quittin'." There.  Easy as pie. 
AMBER Oh my God.  I'm so dead... 
LORETTA Yeah, you betcha... 
INT. HOSPITAL - ANNETTE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Follow Amber in past the now crying candy striper. 
ANNETTE (throwing mints) Go on!  Get out! 
AMBER Mom, look, don't say anything.  First of all, I'm not pregnant. 
Amber sits on the bed.  Annette grabs her shirt. 
AMBER (cont'd) Mom! 
ANNETTE I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up.  I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails. 
AMBER (deep breath) Okay.  Yesterday I...I got this picture.  So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no.  I'm gonna, I-I-I'm gonna quit the pageant.

KIM He's creepy. 
ALEX I heard he's wacko. 
HAIIOND The man is not... wacko. 
KIM Kelly says he's a pervert, spying on the girls undressing in the locker room. 
HAIIOND Sykes may have some problems, but he's no Peeping Tom. He's been thoroughly checked out. 
(CONTINUED) 
23 CONTINUED: 23 They climb the broad front steps of the high school. Hammond glances at his watch. 
HAMNIOND 
(CONTINUING) You're early today. Plenty of time to study with no one to bother you. Kim reaches up.and kisses her father on the cheek. Pulling out a fashion magazine, she rushes off, call- ing back over her shoulder. 
KIM I'.ve got to decide on my hair style for tonight. 
HAMMOND 
(WRYLY) Wonderful. Alex? 
ALEX I'm building an atomic bomb in shop. Smiling, he moves inside. Hammond shakes his head and hurries off. 
24 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 24 
Hammond moves through the empty hallway, stopping at a door which reads: PRINCIPAL: RAYMOND HAMMOND. He is fumbling for his key when he sees through the frosted glass a figure moving around in his office. Reaching for the doorknob, he very quietly opens the door. 
25 INT. OFFICE DAY 25 
As the door slowly swings open, Hammond sees the outer office covered with pieces of paper; sheets are scattered across desks and chairs and over most of the floor. Stepping inside, Hammond spies a WOMAN bending over, frantically picking up paper from the floor. He slams the door. At the sudden SOUND, the startled Woman whirls around, still squatting, and falls on her rear. 
HAMMIOND Who are you? 
25 CONTINUED: 25 Flustered, the attractive young Woman hastily gets to her feet and straightens her skirt. 
WOMAN 
(BADLY FLUSTERED) Oh God! They told me you wouldn't be in till nine! 
HAMMOND 
(INCREDULOUS) What're you doing, robbing me? 
WOMAN 
(GIGGLING 
NERVOUSLY) Oh... no, I'm your Working Girl Hammond stares, wide-eyed. 
WOMAN 
(CONTINUING) your temporary secretary. What's-her-name is sick. (extends her hand) Hi. I'm Adele.

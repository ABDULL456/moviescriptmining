FADE TO: 
Our boys stop.  The pass has seemingly came to an end.  For a short ways the face of the mesa is almost sheer.  The three soldiers take it in. 
EPPS Not much of a pass. 
WES Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now. 
EPPS Picks up again just on the other side. 
They all take a good look at what little there is to cross on, and how far down it is to the hard, jagged rocks below. 
JAEGER Think we can make it? 
WES We make it, or we go back empty handed. 
EPPS Looks like we make it. 
Epps and Wes edge their way towards what's left of the pass. Jaeger just stands there staring down.  Way down. 
FADE TO: 
Epps, Wes and Jaeger inch along the pass hugging the face of the mesa.  Small rocks churn beneath their feet and tumble to the ground below.  No man says a word, they're too busy trying to keep alive, and the air is filled with the sounds of labored breathing. 
Each step so very careful:  Testing the pass for purchase, making sure the footing is solid.  They inch one foot forward, then slide over the next.  Their hands probe the cliff face, fingers crawling like spider legs, looking for something, anything, to take hold of. 
Sweat drips into Epps eye.  He blinks hard and fast trying to clear his vision.  Right now he can't really afford distractions. 
Slowly, carefully, inch by inch the little death dance goes on. 
Jaeger steps.  He steps wrong.  The pass gives way under his foot and begins to slide down.  Instinctively Wes rockets out an arm grabbing Jaeger by the uniform.  At first Jaeger smiles, glad for the save.  But then he realizes something: Wes is literally holding his life in his hands.  All Wes has to do is loosen his grip, and... 
The color drains from Jaeger's face.  Wes stares back blank as a bowl of water. 
Eternity goes on for a second. 
Finally Wes yanks Jaeger back up against the mesa's face, then slides on.  Jaeger just hangs where he is for a beat clutching the rocks for dear life. 
FADE TO: 
Epps makes it to the far side of the broken pass.  He holds out a hand to Wes and reels him in.  Together they both help bring in Jaeger.  Wes looks back over the path they've just crossed. 
WES The US Army:  Always an adventure. 
EPPS Let me see the map. 
Jaeger hands the map to Epps who gives it a going over.  THEY WALK AS THEY TALK. 
EPPS(CONT) Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot. 
WES What do you figure it to be? 
EPPS Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive. 
JAEGER X marks the spot. 
EPPS Something like that. 
JAEGER But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something. 
EPPS I hope it means something, otherwise... 
WES Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere. 
EPPS Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to-- 
Our boys step past a grouping of rocks.  They stop dead. Sitting before them, in what looks like a small camp, is FIVE IRAQI SOLDIERS.  Time clicks by real slow for an instant. It's a delayed reaction, like the beat it takes after you pick up a hot pan before you realize that, yeah, it is burning the flesh from your hand. 
EPPS(CONT) Take cover! 
Our three soldiers turn and bolt back the way they came. They run like wild rabbits for a bit, jumping over a rock formation and hitting the deck using the rocks as cover. Like well-trained warriors they peel their weapons from their shoulders, lock and load, and stand ready.  They wait a bit, taking several deep breaths like divers about to go under. Finally Epps gives the order. 
EPPS(CONT) Let's hit 'em! 
Simultaneously they spring up from behind the rocks and bear down on the Iraqis with their M-16s ready to blow them to kingdom come. 
One problem:  No Iraqis. 
For a beat our three don't move.  They hold position, breath coming hard like sprinters at the end of a race.  They're eyes flint back and forth scanning for something...anything. There's nothing. 
EPPS(CONT) Cover me. 
M-16 still at the ready, Epps raises up taking a tactical stance.  He inches forward, sweeping his weapon back and forth before him for any potential target.  There is none. The Iraqis have vanished.  Epps lowers the M-16, but does not shoulder it. 
EPPS(CONT) Clear.

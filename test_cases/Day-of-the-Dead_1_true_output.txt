SPLASH!!! She steps down off a hidden ledge into A KNEE-DEEP RIVER. She manages to keep her balance but her MACHETE falls into the water and drops to the bottom invisible in the dark silt. Slowly she bends down and reaches into the water. A SNAKE swims past just inches away. SARAH recoils. Before she can reach down again she hears A LOUD, ANIMAL SNORT followed by A GREAT SPLASHING SOUND. Then ANOTHER. She squints to see. 
SHAPES approach on the black water. ALLIGATORS, big ones, just their very tops showing as they move on a straight course toward the woman. 
She backs up feeling for the shore, for the ledge behind her. THE FIRST ZOMBIE GRABS HER SHOULDERS. She spins and sees the thing. It has one eye dangling out of its socket and there's a broken-off length of wooden pole stuck clean through its torso just under the left breast. 
SARAH smashes her RIFLE BUTT INTO THE THING'S HEAD. AGAIN. AGAIN. It keeps coming. (So do the gators. They're getting to within a few yards.) SARAH swings a fourth time. THE ZOMBIE grabs her rifle. She pulls with all her might and the creature, hanging on to the gun, topples off the ledge and into the water. 
When SARAH starts to climb up on the ledge, ANOTHER ZOMBIE lurches towards her from dry land. She spins around, looking for options. The gators are just about close enough to bite her ass and THE ZOMBIE that fell into the river is rising up again, covered with moss and slime and looking pissed. 
SARAH faces THE ZOMBIE on the bank. She has no choice. She aims her AUTOMATIC. She's just about to fire when SOMETHING FLASHES out of the darkness. It's A MACHETE. IT CLEAVES OPEN THE ZOMBIE'S SKULL. From out of the night big JOHN appears. He struggles to free his blade from the dead creature's head. 
SARAH scrambles up onto the muddy ledge. THE GATORS are still moving in and THE ZOMBIE, its moss-covered arms reaching out rigidly like the arms of Frankenstein's monster, is growling ferociously (almost swallowing its own dangling eyeball in the process). 
SARAH Are you gonna pause to say words over the dead this time or can we be on our way? 
Without answering, JOHN steams off through the bush pulling SARAH along behind him, his big hand tight around her arm. 
79	INT. THE CAVE - NIGHT 
CLOSE on: A TELEVISION SCREEN. First there is only VIDEO NOISE, then an image blinks onto the screen. 
MONTAGE: OTHER VIDEO SCREENS on MONITORS in various places throughout the huge underground facility. ZOMBIES watch the screens gathered in groups of four, six and eight, like children in ranked classes. 
The screens show scenes of ZOMBIES taking FOOD from humans in ORANGE CIRCLE VESTS. GUNS are pointed at ORANGE CIRCLES then lowered harmlessly. GUNS are pointed at HUMANS without orange circles and FIRED. The images repeat and repeat and repeat. THE ZOMBIES watch the scenes with dumb curiosity. 
80	INT. COMMUNICATION CENTER IN THE CAVE - NIGHT 
This is the central area for all varieties of communication. There are RADIO CONSOLES, both intercom and outgoing, there are VIDEO CONTROL PANELS and there are LARGE COMPUTER TERMINALS. Reflecting the panic to set up operations back when the disaster first struck, much of the equipment is placed haphazardly and not built in. WIRES run every which way, BARE ANTENNAS AND LOOSE CONNECTORS clutter the place. ENGINEERS scurry with TOOL BOXES constantly repairing, patching, trouble shooting. 
Most of the personnel are TECHNICIANS but there is a group of SCIENTIFIC TYPES, obvious in their white lab coats. Among these is MARY HENRIED, who we caught a glimpse of outside Entrance Two. 
At A SECURITY STATION, A GUARD notices something on one of his own VIDEO SCREENS which monitor key locations inside The Cave. 
GUARD There's activity in the dormitory! 
MARY and one of her assistants, JULIE GRANT, a younger girl, move over to the video console. ONE SCREEN there shows what looks like a prison corridor. CELLS WITH HEAVILY BARRED DOORS run down both sides. We can see the distinct MOVEMENT OF SHADOWS in the corridor. MARY reacts instantly stepping over to AN INTERCOM and pressing A SEND- BUTTON. 
VOICE (o.s. - filter) Gate twenty-three. 
MARY This is Mary Henried. Did anyone enter the dormitory? 
VOICE (o.s. - filter) Yes, ma'm. Captain Rhodes. 
MARY clicks off, infuriated. She hurries towards AN EXIT followed by JULIE GRANT. 
81	INT. THE DORMITORY IN THE CAVE - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: THE MOUTH OF A LARGE PLASTIC BAG. A HAND wearing A BLACK LEATHER GLOVE pulls A HUMAN HEAD out of a bag by its hair. It's the head of one of the dead soldiers from Rhode's platoon. The hand belongs to RHODES himself. 
In the darkness of A CELL, A RED COAT ZOMBIES takes a hesitant step forward. RHODES tries to shove THE HEAD through the bars but IT STICKS. When RHODES lets go it stays there, wedged at shoulder height. 
RHODES Take it, friend. Take it. It's a present. From me to you. 
THE RED COAT steps forward and lays its hand on THE HEAD. 
RHODES Just remember who gives you favours. 
THE ZOMBIE pulls hard and THE HEAD pops through onto its side of the bars. The creature lurches off towards A COT in the shadows at the rear of the cell where it hunkers down and begins to RAVISH THE HEAD, TEARING FLESH OFF, EATING IT hungrily. 
On the cell door we notice A PLAQUE with a number (5) and, written in marker, the Red Coat's nickname, "BLUTO".

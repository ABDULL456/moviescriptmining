BABE BROTHER (shouts) I pay my own way. 
GIDEON Since when? 
He reaches for Babe Brother but Suzie comes between them. 
SUZIE Take Sunny home, please. 
She pushes Babe Brother away. Babe Brother walks away, staring back at his father. 
INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT 
Gideon is lying in bed. Suzie gets in beside him. 
GIDEON Your feet are cold. 
SUZIE Go back to sleep. 
GIDEON I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes. 
SUZIE You all act like two roosters. 
GIDEON I'm not going to let him get away with murder. 
SUZIE You and Babe Brother are so much alike... 
GIDEON He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him. 
SUZIE Hush. 
GIDEON You're always taking his side. 
SUZIE Hush. 
GIDEON I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him. 
SUZIE You're going to find yourself on the floor. 
INT. BABE BROTHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
The bedroom is tastefully furnished with modern art and paintings by Barns. 
Babe Brother wakes up with Sunny standing in the doorway looking at him. It takes Babe Brother some time to fully wake up. 
Finally he sits reluctantly on the side of the bed and Sunny comes over and sits next to him, trying to get his weary father interested in his remote-control racing car. 
BABE BROTHER I want you to be the richest man in the world so I can be the richest father in the world. 
SUNNY I don't want to be rich. I want to work on the railroad like grandfather. 
BABE BROTHER Son, if you are going to have a family, you can't always choose a job just because you like it. (beat) I don't want you to shine anybody's shoes or be a porter. You let somebody else carry your bags. 
Sunny quietly gets up and follows his car out of the room. 
INT. BABE BROTHER'S HOUSE - DAY 
Babe Brother, having showered but still wearing his pajamas, drags himself to the kitchen table where his wife LINDA has a huge coffee mug with the inscription, "I'm the boss", waiting for him. 
Linda is about thirty years old and materially oriented like her husband. She is wearing a conservatively cut business dress. 
Sunny stops playing with his car and gets himself an empty cup. Babe Brother is about to pour him some of his coffee when Linda objects. 
LINDA NO. 
Sunny pleads with her in silence but Linda refuses to yield.

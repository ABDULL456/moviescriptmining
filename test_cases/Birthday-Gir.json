The engine shrieks and wails like a soul in torment. A terrible, mournful grinding noise. Silence. \nNADIA (O.S.) Car trouble? \nJohn tries to start it.

He looks suddenly very sad. \nNADIA I can't see anything. It's too dark. \nShe puts them back in her bag. John watches her. He sees her wrist again. She lights a cigarette, and blows the smoke into the air. \nNADIA What happened between you and the blonde? \nJOHN What? \nNADIA The thin... the girl with small eyes.

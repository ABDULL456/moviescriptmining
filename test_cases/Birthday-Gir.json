{"train": "\"BIRTHDAY GIRL\" \nScreenplay by \nTom Butterworth and Jez Butterworth \nFADE IN: \nIn a Russian summer meadow, a young girl spins around and around. A simple guitar theme plays as the low sun catches her hair. Around her neck is a pair of field binoculars, and she runs through the meadow with them pressed to her face, spying butterflies, birds, rabbits. She reaches the top of a hillock, and jumps into the air, and flies up into the sky. We float up and up with her as she aims the binoculars up, up, into the sun. \nFADE THROUGH SUN TO: \nAn aerial shot of the rolling English countryside. Nothing but fields and trees for miles. The shot describes a panorama before looking directly down, at the earth, and we begin to move. \nWe fly low over a field, a ditch and straight out over six lanes of motorway. Cars and lorries tear below at a hundred miles an hour. We fly over the hard shoulder to another field beyond. \nWe descend on two young boys in the field. A pornographic magazine is spread out of the flattened grass. One of the boys puts a match to the centre page and as the flames lick up, we begin to move again, across the field, over a path and into a suburban garden. \nWe fly over five or six gardens, over a barbecue, over children splashing in a pool, over a woman sunbathing, a man mowing his lawn, a young boy bouncing up and down on a garden trampoline, to arrive on the patio of John Buckingham. He walks out onto the patio, where he sits in a chair, facing his house, setting down a mug of tea. \nCUT TO: \nA blurred face sharpening into focus, John Buckingham, about thirty-two, sitting on his patio, his garden behind, fields beyond. \nJOHN Hello. \nHis hand adjusts a microphone on his lapel. \nJOHN Hello, hello. Hello... \nHe shifts in his chair. Coughs. He looks straight at us. \nJOHN I don't believe in perfect love. You know, love that comes out of the sky like a thunderbolt and uh... This is ridiculous. \nHe removes the microphone. He sits there, thinking very hard. \nJOHN No. No no no. Nope. \nHe stands, turns and stretches. \nBLACKOUT: \nFADE UP: \nHe is sitting as before, looking at us. \nJOHN Running. Reading. Going out. Staying in. The countryside. Films, if they're good. \nBLACKOUT: \nFADE UP: \nJOHN Thoughtful. Outgoing. Ambitious. Well-read. Reasonably popular. Balanced. Trusting. Quite attractive. Outgoing. \nBLACKOUT: \nFADE UP: \nJOHN Someone intelligent, of course. Kind. Pretty I suppose. But its not critical. \nEXT. JOHN'S STREET - DAY \nJohn watches while two removal men lift a new double bed from the back of a van. \nJOHN (V.O.) Someone with a sense of humour. Someone you can communicate with on the same level. Someone you can really talk to. I think communication is key. \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nJohn's hands smooth a crisp white sheet over the double mattress. An ant runs across the sheet. John squashes it and picks it carefully off. \nJOHN (V.O.) I think that by the time most people turn thirty they know where they're going. \nThey shake hands. \nJOHN Welcome. (pause) Well. Look I didn't have a speech but... \nA distorted passenger announcement breaks above us. It's too loud to talk. It ends and they stand there in silence. He points to her luggage. \nJOHN Is that everything? \nNADIA Yes. \nJOHN Right. Okay. Good. \nThey stand there. \nINT. AIRPORT LIFT - DAY \nNadia and John stand side by side in a huge lift. \nJOHN We can talk in the car. \nA deafening roll of thunder. \nEXT. AIRPORT CAR PARK - DAY \nIt's pouring with rain as they cross the car park towards a patched up yellow Rover. John stows the suitcase in the boot and opens the passenger door for her. \nINT. / EXT. JOHN'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY \nJohn turns the key in the ignition. The MG wheezes and coughs. He tries again. Nothing. The third time it just catches and he coaxes it to life. The colour's drained from his cheeks. \nThey head for the motorway. The silence in the car lasts just long enough for John to feel he is breaking it. \nJOHN It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand \"ants\"? \nNADIA Yes. \nJOHN I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it. \nNADIA Yes. \nJOHN I'm pretty nervous. Are you? \nNADIA Yes. \nJOHN I mean... \"Ants.\" \"I've got a problem with ants.\" \nHe shakes his head. \nJOHN I had this... \nHe pulls a sign from his jacket which says \"Nadia!\" \nJOHN As a joke but uh... \nHe tosses it onto the back seat. \nThey drive. He sees Nadia looking at England. \nJOHN So. Is it different to how you imagined it? \nNADIA Yes. \nJOHN I bet. (pause) What about me? Am I how you imagined? \nNADIA Yes. \nHe double-takes, changes lanes. \nJOHN And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you? \nNADIA Yes. \nBRANCH MANAGER (V.O.) Initiative. John is reasonably quick to volunteer whenever others need help. Although he is sometimes reluctant and or unwilling to ask for it himself... \nShe opens some pickled onions and pops one in her mouth. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nCradling the jar of onions, she scans his bookshelf. \nBRANCH MANAGER (V.O.) He is adequate at resolving difficult or emotional customer situations... \nBluffers guide to the Internet. She opens an old copy of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. Inside is written 'John Buckingham Class 3F'. \nBRANCH MANAGER (V.O.) He usually fulfills commitments made to customers within expected time frames. \nINT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - DAY \nShe opens the wardrobe. In a shoebox she finds some photos. \nBRANCH MANAGER (V.O.) Customer Service. John shows a high degree of respect for customers... \nOne of John as a little boy, holding a football, flanked by his parents. On the back someone has written \"Summer 1973\". \nBRANCH MANAGER (V.O.) John still has some reluctance to / or has problems in, carving out new relationships face to face. \nThere is a photo of John, about three years ago, arm in arm with a plain, thin-looking girl, with small eyes. Another of him kissing her on the cheek. \nINT. BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY \nJohn listening. \nBRANCH MANAGER Judgment -- John makes able decisions in most areas of his job. \nINT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - DAY \nNadia sees something at the bottom of the cupboard. She bends down to retrieve a black dustbin liner. She reaches in and pulls out a small stack of hardcore pornographic magazines. \nBRANCH MANAGER (V.O.) John follows instructions conscientiously and responds well to personal directions. \nShe upends the bag and a half dozen videos fall out. She picks up a magazine and begins flicking through it impassively. \nINT. LOUNGE - DAY \nNadia downstairs kneels in front of the T.V. and slips a video into the machine. Nadia's face is lit up by the screen. The sound of sex. \nBRANCH MANAGER (V.O.) John is normally very punctual and in most situations assumes responsibility for his own actions and outcomes. \nShe pops a pickled onion in her mouth, and watches. We see the images close and pixellated, as we did the marriage videos in the titles. It's a bondage scene, the woman wears a gag. \nINT. BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY \nJohn back in the room. The report has finished and the manager is scrutinising him in silence. \nJOHN Thank you -- I think that's very fair. \nINT. / EXT. JOHN'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY \nJohn drives his Rover through the centre of town, the low orange sun on his face. \nEXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - DAY \nThe Rover pulls into the driveway. John opens the glove compartment and removes the ring Nadia gave him, and puts it back on. He collects a brown paper package from the passenger seat. \nINT. JOHN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nJohn and Nadia at the supper table. She is knitting the jumper. Despite the silence, John seems more relaxed, in shirtsleeves and loosened tie. He puts his fork down, and places the brown bag on the table, pushing it across to Nadia. She opens it and removes a big hardback Russian - English dictionary. John smiles and nods \"open it\". She flicks through it. \nShe turns it over in her hands, nods, puts the book down, reaches under the table and surfaces with the stack of porn magazines. She puts them on the table next to the dictionary. \nJohn beholds the pile. \"Wet N' Wild\" is on top. \nHe rises slowly from the table and sleepwalks from the kitchen. \nRain coming down in John's garden. The pair sit under the shelter of the back porch. John has his hands out as Nadia is winding red wool it into a ball. The jumper is half finished. \nThe rabbits shelter from the rain under broad leaves. \nJohn in a pub with a four colleagues from the bank. He sips his half, half listening to the conversation. It all seems so dull. He finishes his drink and looks at his watch. They ask him if he's staying for another. \nA knitting needle is drawn from a row of red stitches on the nearly-finished jumper. \nNadia kneels over John holding the knitting needles. She presses one to his skin and we watch it drawn across his chest in close up, up to his neck. \nHis eyes are fixed on hers. \nClose up on Nadia's face. Her mouth is gagged and she's lying on her front, head half-buried in a pillow. We can just make out John behind, on top of her. Both are lying still and breathing hard, covered in sweat. Catching her breath Nadia yanks the gag off and wriggles out from underneath him. She snatches up a towel and covering herself hurries to the bathroom. \nThe guitar theme ends. \nINT. LANDING - NIGHT \nJohn presses his ear to the bathroom door. The sound of retching. \nThe toilet flushes. John pads back to his bedroom. Through the gap in the door he sees Nadia coming out, go to her room, and shut the door. He rests his head against the door frame. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOUNGE - DAY \nA beautiful morning. Through the patio window, John watches Nadia in the garden, sitting on the lawn reading her dictionary in the sunlight. In dungarees with her hair up, she looks very young. \nEXT. GARDEN - DAY \nHe walks warily out into the sunlight. She looks up, then back to the big book in her lap. He places the tea next to her on the grass. \nJOHN Are you O.K.? \nShe looks at him, then down at her tome. She speaks slowly, in a heavy accent: \nNADIA Today is bath day. \nJOHN Sorry? \nShe studies her book. Looks up. \nNADIA Today is bath day. \nHe shakes his head. \nJOHN Bath day? \nShe nods. \nJOHN I don't understand. \nNADIA Happy bath day. \nThe penny drops. \nJOHN Today? \nShe frowns. John leafs through the dictionary. \nJOHN Syevodnya? \nNADIA Syevodnya \nJOHN Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. \nHe puts his hand on her shoulder. \nNADIA Party. (pause) Party. Syevodnya. \nJohn nods, smiling. \nYURI (to John) You don't speak Russian? Pratsteetye! This explains your cold eyes. \nNadia begins gabbling to Yuri in Russian. Yuri says the English word -- \"Friends\". \nNADIA (to John) \"Frenzy\". \nJOHN Yes I know. \nYURI (himself) Yuri. (Rasputin) Alexei. Alexei and Yuri. \nAlexei speaks. \nJOHN What did he say? \nYURI He says he feels safe here. \nNadia talks fast to Yuri. \nYURI She says she wanted to tell you but her English is shit. And no one speaks Russian, it's very hard for her. The light please. \nAlexei turns off the light again. Nadia blows out her candles. They are plunged back into darkness. John turns the light on again. Yuri is already sitting down. \nJOHN I need to know who you are first please. \nYURI Oh. (Yuri stands) We are Russian. \nJOHN Yes. I know. \nYURI Good. (he sits down) \nJOHN And... \nYURI And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you. \nHe hands John another bottle of vodka. \nJOHN Hold on. \nYURI Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us. \nVodka is splashed into their glasses. Yuri raises his glass and shouts a toast in Russian: \"Vashe Zdarovye!\". They down their vodka, John sips at his, then realises he must finish it. Yuri makes as if to throw his in the fireplace. \nYURI Just kidding. \nSausages, cheese, bread and pickle bottles rain onto the table from Yuri's rucksack. \nJOHN (to Yuri) So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins? \nYURI (shaking his head) Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem. \nJOHN Right. \nYURI We better watch him. He's crazy. \nJOHN Right. \nYURI I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me. \nYuri mimes giving a blow-job. \nYURI I mean he smokes me. Do you say \"smoke\" in U.K.? \nHe mimes the blowjob again. \nJOHN No. \nYURI Right. So I can say he smokes me. So. \nPause. \nJOHN So? \nYURI \"I have these uh...\" She explains to you... \"When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses.\" Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds. \nWe see John's face. \nJOHN Binoculars. \nYURI Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war. \nCUT TO: \nScene 1 reprise. \nEXT. SUMMER MEADOW - DAY \nA young girl runs through a summer meadow with a pair of Russian Army field binoculars, around her neck. \nYURI (V.O.) I would run around with them taking pictures of things I liked with my mind. If I saw something beautiful I would take a picture. \nWith the binoculars pressed to her face, she spies butterflies, birds, a rabbit. She stops running and aims the binoculars up, up, into the sun \nINT. JOHN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nYuri translates. \nYURI The day before I left Russia my father gave me the old binoculars. He said that when I saw you I was to stand far away and look at you with these, and to examine your face closely. And if you were a bad person I could run away. \nNadia looks at the table. \nYURI She says she took a picture. \nJohn watches Nadia looking at the table. She glances up once and catches his eye. \nAlexei suddenly slams his hand down on the table. He raises his palm. There is an ant squashed there. He shows Yuri. \nALEXEI Nasyekski. \nEXT. JOHN'S GARDEN - NIGHT \nThe small party has moved outside to the patio, where they sit around a low wooden table in the mellow candlelight. A huge late Summer moon hangs over the fields. Alexei tinkles beautifully on his guitar. \nHe stops asks a question in Russian. \nJOHN What was that? \nYURI Oh nothing. \nJOHN Tell me. \nYURI No. It is too judgmental. \nJOHN Tell me what he said. \nYURI He says why did you send to Russia for a wife. \nSilence. John suddenly looks sick. \nYURI You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love. \nJOHN No. It's not that. \nYURI Do you believe in love? \nJOHN I suppose it's... I mean define your terms. \nYURI It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something. \nHe takes a plate and starts reaching for the food. \nYURI Here look, something beautiful from Russia. Here is Life, there, take it. \nJohn accepts the plate. \nNext to the rabbit skin is a hand-drawn map. A dotted line winds around the map and ends with an X in a small wood. \nHe looks at the rabbit skin, with its eyeless sockets. \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nJohn follows a path through a big silent wood, the low sun flaring and catching his white work shirt. \nP.O.V. OF JOHN \nthrough binoculars, a long way off and squinting into the sun. \nNadia lowers the binoculars and looks past us. \nCUT TO: \nJohn spots some figures lying on the grass in the distance. He heads towards them, and watches them for a moment from thirty yards away. \nAlexei, Yuri and Nadia sit in a small clearing. A blanket, cushions, bread and vodka are scattered around. Yuri is strumming a guitar. Alexei and Nadia are laughing and chatting. He removes a small twig from her hair and flattens it under his big hand. John watches the gesture. It's so intimate they could be lovers. \nYURI (calls) John. We can see you hiding. \nJohn steps out of his hiding place and approaches the group. Alexei has Nadia falling about laughing about something. He smiles at her then nods to John. \nPieces of cooked rabbit lie in tin foil. Alexei feeds a piece to Nadia with a big hunting knife. Nadia smiles at John, and starts knitting. \nYURI How is bank? \nJOHN Fine. I thought you were leaving today. \nYURI To be indoors on such a day. It's crime. \nNadia stops knitting and takes her shirt off and stretches back to sunbathe in her black bra. Alexei takes the knife he has just finished cleaning and holds the cold wide blade flat above Nadia's bare stomach. Just before pressing it down he looks across at John. Nadia yelps and sits up. They laugh, and Yuri joins in. John laughs uneasily. \nAlexei notices marks on Nadia's midriff. He asks her about them in Russian. \nJohn goes white, unable to understand Nadia's explanation. He has no idea what she told him. \nEXT. LAKE IN FOREST - DAY \nAt sunset, the four run towards a lake in their underwear. They jump and dive in, and begin splashing each other. \nJohn duck-dives under the water and swims through the sunlit streaked green water. We see him under the water, swimming towards us, caught by the sun's rays. \nJohn surfaces, and wipes the water from his eyes. He spots Alexei and Nadia playing in the water. Alexei grabs her and throws her in the air and she comes down with a splash. \nJohn treads water nearby. He watches them both hold their noses and disappear under the surface. \nThey've both vanished. John ducks under the water. \nJohn's underwater P.O.V.: It's too murky to see anything. \nThe two surface, breathing hard, laughing. John watches them. \nAlexei holds Nadia tight and looks like he might even kiss her. But instead he ducks her and holds her under the water. \nJohn treads water nearby. She's been under a long time. \nJOHN Hey. \nJohn begins to swim toward Alexei. Just as he gets near, Alexei lets Nadia surface, coughing and spluttering -- she shouts at Alexei in Russian, angry. \nAlexei makes for her again but she pushes him away, twice, almost slapping him. She is very uncomfortable. She swims away. \nYuri admonishes his friend in Russian. Alexei stares at John, then swims off powerfully back towards the shore. \nYURI He's just having fun. He's maybe too strong you know... \nJohn watches Nadia walk out of the lake towards her clothes. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAlexei and Yuri shout at each other. Nadia begins crying. \nYURI Sit down please. \nJohn sits across the table from Nadia. \nJOHN Tell him to stop and let her go, and we'll talk. \nThe kettle boils. Alexei takes the kettle and holds it over Nadia's head. \nJohn springs up. \nJOHN Put the fucking kettle down. \nYURI John. \nJOHN Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him. \nYuri translates -- Alexei replies. \nYURI He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says. \nJOHN What? What does he want? \nAlexei speaks. \nJOHN What did he say? Tell me! \nYURI He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry. \nJOHN What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ? \nYURI He wants money. \nJOHN Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money. \nYuri translates this for Alexei. Alexei has a reply. \nYURI He wants a lot of money. \nJOHN I'll give him money. Tell him to put the... \nYURI He wants the money from your bank. \nJOHN I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there. \nYURI You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank. \nJOHN I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus. \nThe penny drops. \nJOHN Oh Jesus. \nYURI He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not. \nJOHN Oh Jesus. Of course I can't. \nAlexei doesn't need the translation he tilts the kettle, and a small amount of boiling water trickles onto Nadia's hair. She screams through the gag. \nJohn tries to reach across to her but Alexei draws the knife and holds it to his face. \nJOHN Just leave her alone. \nYURI I'm so sorry. \nJOHN Leave her alone. \nCLOSE UP On Nadia's terrified eyes, imploring John to help her. \nINT. / EXT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY \nJOHN Yes. \nBRANCH MANAGER We're starting to see results. This is Karen, who's uh... taking uh... it. \nThey say hello to each other and MOSELEY asks her a couple of questions. \nJOHN Excuse me. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nJohn nips out and fetches his guitar cases. He rounds the corner, down a couple of steps. He checks himself into the Safe Area. A Colleague passes him. \nCOLLEAGUE Morning John. Hey, Moseley's here. \nJOHN I'll give you a tune later. \nINT. SAFE ROOM DOOR - DAY \nJohn punches in the security code. He opens the safe door and goes inside, closing it behind him. We see his stricken face peering through the toughened glass. \nINT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY \nRobert Moseley falls backwards into the arms of an employee. \nMOSELEY It's weird isn't it. \nA little bored perhaps, Moseley gazes out through the open door. He sees... \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nJohn bowling out of the safe-room backwards heaving two guitar cases. One bursts open spilling bundles of fifties onto the floor. \nINT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY \nMoseley, the Branch Manager, Clare, and five Trust and Letting Go catchers all watch... \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY \nJohn scoops up the money, refasten the case and stand to see them all watching him, as the five Trust and Letting Go fallers crash to the ground in unison. \nEXT. SIDE STREET - DAY \nJohn hauls ass towards us straight down the middle of the road, a guitar case in either hand, footsteps clapping loudly on the wet cobbles. Alarms sound, dogs bark. \nEXT. STREET CORNER - DAY \nHe skis around a corner, and sprints up this other street. We are close by his head, as he sprints one hundred metres. \nEXT. CAR PARK ROOF - DAY \nRunning flat out across the car park. Yuri throws open the car door and John hurls the guitar cases inside. He dives in, turns the key in the ignition. The Rover coughs and wheezes. He tries again. It spits and misfires. The third time it catches and lives. John grinds the gears and lurches off. \nINT. MULTI STOREY CAR PARK - DAY \nThe Rover hurtles down the ramps. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nIt careens down a side-street. \nINT. / EXT. MOVING ROVER - DAY \nAlexei opens one of the cases and looks inside. He takes a deep breath and swears in Russian. \nHe shows what is in the case to Nadia. Her eyes widen. \nAlexei gently lowers the gag and kisses her on the mouth. She returns the kiss hungrily. \nJohn spots them in the mirror and nearly crashes the car. \nHe looks desperately across at Yuri. Yuri is now pointing the big knife at John's ribs. The Russian shrugs almost apologetically. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nYuri in the bathroom, he undoes his flies pees. At the other end of the bathroom, tied to the bidet, gagged, is John. \nYURI How you doing? \nJohn refuses to meet his eye. Yuri flushes and wipes his hands. \nYURI I'll show you something. It should make all this easier I think. \nFrom his back pocket, Yuri takes out an old envelope. He opens it and removes a dozen or so Polaroids. \nJohn looks down at the first Polaroid. Nadia, Alexei and a man John doesn't recognise at a birthday party. There is a cake with candles and everyone is smiling. The next picture is the same. And the next. \nSometimes Germany, sometimes France, but otherwise the pictures are the same, each 'fiancee' beaming with his arm round Nadia, Alexei looking on. \nJohn studies the faces of his fellow dupes and at last comes to his own picture. Despite himself tears come to his eyes. \nYURI Not all these bastards were like you, believe me. You should not too feel bad. \nYuri takes John's left hand and pulls off Nadia's ring. He puts it in his pocket. \nINT. MOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAlexei smokes on the bed. Nadia is lying the other way. She holds her hand out for his cigarette and he passes it. They have the relaxed air of longtime lovers. \nSubtitles again. \nNADIA It's enough isn't it? \nALEXEI What do you mean? \nNADIA You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop. \nALEXEI Do you want to stop? \nNADIA Yes. \nALEXEI We'll stop then. \nThey kiss. He takes her hand, and notices the tie marks on her wrists. \nALEXEI What's this? \nNADIA It's nothing. I burnt myself. \nALEXEI That's not a burn. \nNADIA It is. I did it cooking. \nThey sit there looking at each other. \nALEXEI On both wrists? \nNadia looks back at him. The seconds pass. \nNADIA What? I did it cooking. \nAlexei studies her face. She pulls a face. He keeps staring. \nNADIA What? \nThey sit there in silence. Alexei is so big, and she is so small. \nNADIA Listen, I made you something. \nNadia leans over the bed, and searches in her bag. Alexei watches her closely. She comes back up with the jumper she has knitted. \nNADIA Put it on. \nHe looks at the jumper, then back at her. \nThey sit side by side in the waiting room, not talking. Nadia looks resigned to her fate. John is tight-jawed, unyielding. \nThey wait as the the Duty Sergeant deals with a woman who's lost her hat. \nNADIA (quietly, to John) Where's the restroom? \nJOHN What? \nNADIA I'm going to be sick. Where's the... \nJOHN What? No you're not.. \nNADIA I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick. \nJOHN (overlapping) No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ? \nNadia stands and addresses the Duty Sergeant. \nNADIA Where's the restroom? \nSERGEANT The what, love? \nNADIA The toilet. Where's... \nSERGEANT Down there on the left. \nShe heads off. John springs up. He seizes her arm as casually as possible. \nINT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY \nJohn frog marches Nadia down the corridor to the Ladies. She wrestles her arm free again and disappears inside. \nJohn lurks outside. He seems certain she's got one leg out the window RIGHT NOW. \nHe can't bear it any longer. He looks both ways and nips inside. \nINT. LADIES - DAY \nStanding in the Ladies, John hears Nadia in a cubicle, throwing up. He hears the toilet flush. \nNadia comes out. He looks at her. \nJOHN You're pregnant. \nNadia looks at the floor. \nINT. POLICE CORRIDOR - DAY \nJohn walks out of the toilet and stands against the wall of the corridor. He looks both ways. After a few seconds Nadia appears in the corridor. They stand there. John isn't looking at her. \nA policeman appears from round the corner, and walks towards them. He stops, and addresses John. \nPOLICEMAN Can I help you? \nJohn looks at the Policeman, then at Nadia. The seconds pass. \nPOLICEMAN Sir? Can I help you? \nJohn is still looking at Nadia -- He closes his eyes. \nJOHN No. \nEXT. OUTSIDE POLICE STATION - DAY \nJohn walks back to the Rover, Nadia behind. They reach the car. Nadia looks at John over the roof of the car. \nNADIA What are you doing? \nJohn looks sick. He speaks very quietly. \nJOHN Get in the car. \nINT. / EXT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY \nNadia puts a cigarette in her mouth and pops the dashboard lighter. John takes the cigarette and throws it out the window, followed by the lighter. Nadia just gazes out of the window. \nJOHN So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name... \nNADIA I don't want to talk about him. \nJOHN Fine. \nNADIA It's none of your business. \nJOHN Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock. \nNadia ignores him. \nJOHN So uh... \nNADIA Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is. \nJOHN Oh Jesus. \nNADIA If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does. \nJOHN (overlapping -- bigger) Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks. \nNADIA But, you know, so what? \nThey drive. \nJOHN It's his baby I take it. \nShe doesn't answer. \nJOHN Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed. \nNADIA He will come back. \nJOHN Excuse me? \nNADIA He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again. \nJOHN Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too. \nNADIA No. But you tend to tie them up. \nJohn freezes. He looks across. Nadia gives nothing back. \nJOHN Fuck off. \nNadia is just looking at him. \nJOHN Fuck off. You started it. \nShe is just looking at him. \nJOHN I don't want to talk about it. \nNADIA Why not? \nJOHN Shut up. I'm not listening. \nNADIA You don't want to talk about it. \nJOHN No. \nNADIA Okay we won't talk about it. \nNadia looks out the window. \nNADIA We'll pretend it never happened. \nJohn turns to her. \nNADIA It's no big thing. You are the same as most men. You are a man so you are a savage. Not a monster, but half animal. You put on a tie and you go to the bank, but really you are a beast. But also you are from woman so you have a soul. Half beast, half soul. But you hide your beast in the bottom of the wardrobe. It's not so healthy. It's fucked you up, no? \nJohn stops the car. \nJOHN Get out. \nShe sits there. \nNADIA Excuse me? \nJOHN Get out \nNADIA You are throwing me out. \nJOHN Get out. \nShe collects her bag from the back seat, her cigarettes, gathers up her belongings, clicks open the door and gets out, leaving the shot. John sits there staring ahead. We hear her voice offscreen. \nNADIA (O.S.) You prefer your women mute. \nJohn turns the key in the ignition. The engine bellows and screams. Silence. \nHe tries again. The engine shrieks and wails like a soul in torment. A terrible, mournful grinding noise. Silence. \nNADIA (O.S.) Car trouble? \nJohn tries to start it. It lets out a whimper, a crying, a few juddering moving sobs, and dies. \nJohn sits in his dead car. He shakes his head. He rubs his face. He sits there. \nEXT. ROADSIDE VERGE - DUSK \nThe two of them on a verge ten feet apart. John stares into the distance. \nNadia studies the map. \nNADIA It's another twenty miles. It's going dark. \nShe gets her holdall from inside the car and stuffs the map inside. \nNADIA What now? \nNadia scans the horizon with her binoculars. John watches her. \nJOHN Jesus. You weren't even on the plane. \nNadia lowers her binoculars and looks at John. \nFLASHBACK - INT. AIRPORT - DAY \nJohn watches the passengers stream out of the arrivals gate. A woman is greeted and spun around. \nAcross the airport, Nadia lowers her binoculars. We pull back to see she is standing next to Alexei. \nThey say goodbye in Russian. Even though we don't see subtitles, it's a telling exchange. She kisses him, and he watches her leave him and walk across the floor. \nAlexei watches Nadia approach John, and see him shake her hand. \nThey walk away together. \nFLASHBACK - EXT. JOHN'S STREET - NIGHT \nAlexei, dressed in a suit, stands outside John's house, looking up. Nadia is in the window, her lipstick smeared. They gaze at each other. \nEXT. DIFFERENT FOREST - NIGHT \nIn a clearing, John watches Nadia carry a pile of sticks to a fire she is building. She lights it with her gun cigarette lighter, and teases the flames to life. \nEXT. FOREST - NIGHT \nNADIA Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John? \nJOHN She's dead. \nPause. \nNADIA I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I'm sorry. That's awful. Forgive me. \nPause. \nNADIA I'm sorry. \nJOHN I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all. \nNadia looks at John. \nNADIA What? \nJOHN I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry. \nNADIA She's alive? \nNadia starts to laugh. Long and loud. We have never seen her laugh before. \nNADIA She's alive!! She is not dead? \nJOHN Laugh it up. \nShe starts to cough. She gets on her hands and knees and coughs like fury. \nJOHN You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog. \nNADIA I'm trying to quit. \nJOHN I've got news for you. It's not working. \nNADIA I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy. \nJOHN Nobody's that unhappy. \nNADIA Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die? \nJOHN I don't want anyone to die. \nNADIA Except for Small Eyes. \nJOHN Except for Small Eyes. \nShe laughs again. \nNADIA So why did it end? \nJohn thinks. It looks as if he's going to tell the whole story. In the end he shrugs. \nJOHN I don't know. \nNADIA What was her name? \nJOHN What's your name? \nThe fox cries out again. \nNADIA Listen. It's definitely a fox. Now I'm scared. \nThey listen to the fox crying in the night. \nNADIA You know you can come under the blanket. \nJOHN It's alright. \nThe scene from bird's eye view. John lies back and stares at the stars. Nadia curls up on the other side of the fire, and hugs herself. \nNADIA No it wasn't. \nJohn shrugs. He takes them. \nNADIA Goodbye. \nJohn nods and turns. Nadia watches him walk away. \nINT. / EXT. AIRPORT EXIT - NIGHT \nOn the other side of the airport, John stands in front of the exit to the taxi ranks. He's got nowhere to go. Passengers swirl around him. \nHe looks at the binocular in his hands. He removes the binoculars and looks at them. Suddenly he stops. In the case is a folded note marked John. John holds it in his hands -- Slowly, deliberately, he screws it up, and drops it in the case like a bin. \nP.O.V. OF JOHN \nThrough the binoculars. Passengers criss-cross, but we find Nadia sitting alone, waiting for her call. \nJohn lowers the binoculars and gazes across the airport. He raises them for one last look. \nNadia, glimpsed through the crowd. We spy someone standing about twenty feet behind her. It is Alexei. \nWe watch Alexei approach her. She looks up and is completely thrown. \nYuri stands about ten feet away, in shades. \nJohn lowers the binoculars, horrified. He looks again. \nNadia pulls her arm away. Alexei crouches down in front of her and puts a hand on her knee, coaxing her. \nAlexei takes her by the arm and leads her away. \nEXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT \nJohn hurries out of the exit to catch the trio leaving a different exit fifty yards away, where they get into a taxi. \nEXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT \nJohn runs across a car park and over a low fence. \nEXT. SLIP ROAD TO AIRPORT - NIGHT \nHe chases down a slip road, as the taxi rounds the corner behind us. He takes cover behind a van as they drive past, and away. \nEXT. GRASS VERGE - NIGHT \nJohn runs across a grass verge and another car park. He sees the taxi rounding the corner and head down the road in front of him. \nJohn runs as fast as he can up this road, but the taxi is getting away. Eventually he gives up, and he drives away. \nEXT. ROUNDABOUT - NIGHT \nAt the roundabout it turns round and starts coming back up the road. John hides behind a car, and watches the taxi pull up outside a small hotel about fifty yards away. He watches the trio head into the hotel. \nEXT. HOTEL PERIMETER - NIGHT \nJohn skirts around the edge of the hotel. He peers in through one of the windows. It's the foyer. He heads around the back. \nEXT. BACK OF HOTEL - NIGHT \nAt the back of the hotel he looks through another couple of windows. Suddenly he drops like he's been shot, and sits on the grass. \nWarily he looks again. \nEXT. / INT. THE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW \nAlexei stands smoking in the middle of the room. Nadia is sitting in a chair crying. \nAlexei kneels again and appeals to her. Nadia is resisting and yells back, but something Alexei says seems to melt her resolve. \nHe holds her face, and kisses it. She turns her face. He tries again, and this time she accepts the kiss. Slowly she kisses him back. \nNADIA What are you doing here? \nJohn and Nadia look at each other. \nALEXEI What the fuck is he doing here? \nHe looks at the little gun. \nALEXEI That's that cigarette lighter I gave you isn't it? \nAlexei stands. John takes a step back. Alexei walks calmly towards John and throws a punch. It catches John right on the chin and he hits the wall and goes down very fast. \nNADIA Stop. \nAlexei turns round to see Nadia holding the knife. He is dumbstruck. \nALEXEI What? What are you doing? \nNADIA (to John) What are you doing here? \nAlexei kicks John in the ribs. \nNADIA (in Russian) Stop it! \nHe looks at Nadia, the girl he came back for, angrily pointing the knife at him. He suddenly looks completely punctured. John has struggled up again and stands behind him. They are both looking at Nadia. \nALEXEI What. You're what? You're with this creep now. \nNADIA Leave him! \nALEXEI You have. You've actually fallen for this prick. \nNADIA No I haven't. \nAlexei looks dumbstruck. He laughs emptily \nALEXEI Babe it's me. I won't let you get away. \nNadia stares back at him. The seconds pass. She speaks in a whisper. \nNADIA I'll kill you if you try. \nIn the impasse, John picks up a lamp and hurls it at Alexei's head. It is going to hit him, but reaches the length of its cord and stops six inches short. In the confusion. Alexei grabs Nadia's wrist and forces her to the ground. He grabs the knife, just as John brains him with one of the guitars. It emits a fruity final chord. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR / ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT \nWhistling, Yuri comes out of his suite, knocks briskly on the door of Alexei's and enters. We walk with him down the hallway into the bedroom to find Alexei, heartbroken, tied and bound to a desk chair. \nYuri murmurs something in Russian. \nSUBTITLE Fuck a duck. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT \nNadia stands at the window and stares at her reflection, or past it into the blackness. \nNADIA Get their passports. \nJohn finishes tying up Yuri, and removes his passport from his jacket. Behind Nadia another plane arcs up into the night sky. \nHe takes Alexei's passport from his pocket, but Alexei is only watching Nadia. \nALEXEI Don't do this. \nShe carefully places tape across his mouth. \nAlmost as if having second thoughts she bends down to kiss his cheek. The 'kiss' suddenly makes Alexei's eyes widen in pain. As she stands her lips are bloody. She's bitten him on the cheek. A single streak of blood runs from the gash. \nNADIA (to John) Get your money. \nPause. \nJOHN Yeah, you see when I said I didn't speak Russian I wasn't actually just making it up. \nShe leans forwards and whispers in his ear. John looks at her. He looks to the four corners of the airport. And back at her. \nJOHN Why? \nNADIA I'm not asking you to marry me. \nJOHN No. What? No. I know. \nNADIA It's more like a date. \nJOHN It's a long way to go for a date. \nNADIA Tell me about it. \nPause. She speaks softly in Russian. We see the subtitle: \nNADIA All that matters is to try... \nJohn frowns. \nNADIA (in Russian) We can only try. Say it. \nJohn repeats the phrase in Russian. \nJOHN What does it mean? \nNADIA Maybe you will find out. \nPause. Nadia kneels and opens the guitar case. She stealthily removes about five hundred. \nNADIA Hurry. I'll wait for you here. \nJOHN Right. \nINT. TICKET SALES - NIGHT \nJohn runs across the airport to the ticket desk. He joins a queue of about three people. He works his way to the front. \nJOHN Is the flight full? \nOFFICIAL I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed. \nJOHN Please check. Is it full? Please could you check. \nBACK TO: \nINT. AIRPORT - NIGHT \nNadia stands alone holding her unlit cigarette, thinking. She looks at the two guitar cases at her feet. She looks across at John, anxiously drumming on the ticket sales counter. What is she thinking? \nINT. TICKET SALES - NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT on the photo of Yuri in his passport. \nThe Aeroflot desk official holds the passport and studies at John. With his four day beard there is a resemblance, but it's far from perfect. \nOFFICIAL You have excellent English. \nJOHN Thanks. \nOFFICIAL How do you want to pay? \nJOHN Cash. \nJohn collects his ticket, turns and heads back to where he left Nadia with the guitar cases. He suddenly stops. \nShe's gone. \n", "test1_input": "INT. SPARE BEDROOM - DAY \nNadia peers around the door to find John standing next to a narrow monk-like single bed. \nJOHN The uh... the other bedroom... \nShe looks at it, then up at John. She turns and walks out. \nNow she's back, with her camouflaged hold-all, dumps it onto the floor, heaves the suitcase onto the bed and smoking no- hands, starts unpacking. John plugs in the lamp by the bed. To show Nadia how it works he switches it on, off, on, off, and then feels stupid. \nJOHN I'll get an ashtray. \nWith John gone, Nadia stops unpacking. She walks to the window and stares out over the rooftops of the estate. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOUNGE - DAY \nJohn on the phone. \nANSWER MACHINE You have reached From Russia with Love. Our office reopens on Monday. If you are interested in our services... (etc. etc.) Thank You. \nJOHN This is John Buckingham from St Albans. I need to speak to you urgently. There's a critical problem. It's... Call me back as soon as possible. It's critical. \nINT. STAIRS / LANDING - DAY \nJohn climbs the stairs holding a saucer for an ashtray. He knocks lightly on the spare room door. \nINT. SPARE ROOM / LANDING - DAY \nNadia is lying asleep on the bed in only her black underwear. We duck straight back out. \nJohn composes himself. He puts his head back round the door as if there's a real chance it will be shot off. She's facing away, arms folded, still holding the cigarette. It has burnt out, leaving a long curl of ash on her bare hip. \nHe approaches the bed with immense trepidation, eases the cigarette from between her fingers and drops it in the bin. He stares at her bare hip, with the ash on it. Holding the saucer under the ash, he blows on it gently. It takes three careful breaths before it drops in the saucer. Unseen by John, her eyes are wide open as he steals out onto the landing. We stay with her a moment. \nCUT TO: \nA pot of stew, bubbling on the hob. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nJohn is stirring a pot on the hob. By his expression he might be defusing a bomb. \nHis head cocks, he stiffens. Nadia walks right into the kitchen. She's changed, jeans and a tee shirt. Nadia takes the spoon from him, says something in Russian, gestures for him to sit. \nShe tastes the stew. Now she stirs the pot. He watches her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nJohn and Nadia sit opposite each other. She takes a mouthful. They catch one another's eye. And again. \nOn the wall across, six ants careen in crazy circles. John can see them, but doesn't move. \nHe puts his fork down. \nJOHN I don't know what to say. Your letters were in English. Good English. You said you'd studied English. \nNadia reaches down into her bag and pulls out a small box wrapped in brown paper. She places it in front of him. \nHe warily unwraps a little wooden box. He opens the lid and fishes out a simple gold ring. He holds it in his palm. \nJOHN I can't take this. \nHe puts it back in the box, hoping it will disappear. \nShe fishes it out again and holds it on her palm for him to take. \nJOHN I can't take it. I'm not really a ring guy. \n", "test1_true": "JOHN Okay. No big deal. Thank you. Yes thanks. Thank you. \nINT. LOUNGE - NIGHT \nJohn and Nadia sit next to each other on the couch watching T.V. John's gaze seems to go through the T.V. and a thousand yards beyond. Nadia is knitting a half-finished jumper, blood red. \nJohn stands and disappears out of shot. \nJOHN (O.S.) If anyone gets this message please call as soon as possible. It's an emergency. \nJohn sits back down. He steals side-glances at her. Her mouth. Her red-painted fingers knitting fast. \nJohn flips through the channels -- \nThe Money Programme. Antique's Roadshow. Cup Rugby. \nEventually he offers Nadia the remote control. She takes, aims it at the T.V. but doesn't press it. Just as it seems she won't, she does: University Challenge. \nThey watch University Challenge with Nadia still aiming the control and smoking. After another long pause she flips the button -- \nThe Money Programme. Antiques Roadshow. Rugby. \nShe flips again then hands the controls back to John and they watch University Challenge. \nNadia puts down her knitting, stretches and yawns. \nINT. LOUNGE / STAIRS - NIGHT \nNadia climbs the stairs. John watches her, hovering in the doorway of the darkened lounge. \nHe hears the bathroom door close before venturing up. \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nJohn sits on the edge of his bed. He cocks his head: \nDoor opening and shutting; feet padding along landing; door closing. Silence. He squeezes his door open and peers down the dark landing. The coast is clear. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nBrushing his teeth, staring accusingly at his reflection. Spits. Finished, he takes a deep breath and opens the door, and gives a small shout. \nNadia is standing right outside the door; Nightshirt, damp hair, toothbrush in her mouth. \nJOHN Good night. \nHe squeezes past and quick-steps down the landing. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHe climbs into the big bed, fully clothed, turns off the light and lies there in the moonlight. \nAfter twenty seconds, the bedroom door clicks open. John climbs out of bed as casually as possible and stands around. \nJOHN You should go now. We'll talk in the morning. \nHis eyes widen but he can't speak. He wants to but she's placed her hand across his mouth. She reaches down and takes his hand, and draws it towards her, slowly tracing his fingers across her breasts. She unbuttons her shirt and pulls his hand inside. \nHe's breathing hard, her right hand still clasped over his mouth. Her free hand lowers to press against him, and unzip his fly. He lets out a moan. \nWe concentrate on their faces. Above the silence all we can hear is John's breathing -- Before long Nadia looks down -- He's come. \nNadia turns and walks out, leaving John marooned, gasping in and blowing out, angry almost, buttoning his trousers. \nEXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - NIGHT \nExterior view of John's darkened house. A fox trots across the Cul-De-Sac and sits under John's car, where it curls up. \nINT.

Nadia opens her eyes in the sun-filled room. \nINT. LANDING - DAY \nShe pads down the hall in her nightshirt and opens the door to the bathroom. There on the toilet, naked, is John. He gives another short shout. Nadia holds his eye for a couple of seconds too long, before shutting us inside with him. \nEXT. JOHN'S GARDEN - DAY \nJohn sprints down his lawn, scattering the big black crows eating his garden. He jumps the fence, and across the fields. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nJohn jogs along by a river in the countryside behind his house, wearing shorts and a tee shirt. His breath billows around him in the sharp morning air. \nHe stops running by a gate overlooking a small hill. He doubles up to recover, panting hard. \nINT. JOHN'S GARDEN - DAY \nTwo wild rabbits are nibbling the remains of a big breakfast left on the lawn. John climbs heavily back over his fence. \nThere's a deck chair out there, surrounded by the remains of breakfast. Some glossy Russian magazines, a full ashtray, Nadia's knitting. \nThe patio door is ajar, the net curtain billowing. He scans the garden jumpily. The boy next door is on his trampoline, bouncing up and down, watching John at the top of each bounce. \nINT. JOHN'S HOUSE - DAY \nSweating from the run, John peers up the stairs. The house is silent. In the lounge he picks up the phone and dials a number. \nANSWER MACHINE You have reached From Russia With Love. If you are interested... \nHe hangs up. \nINT. LANDING - DAY \nJohn stands with his ear to the bathroom door. The shower's on. \nINT. NADIA'S BEDROOM - DAY \nIt's empty. He slips inside. \nStuff everywhere. Cigarette cartons, several lighters, spare wool, suitcase, rucksack. Huge poster of Bruce Springsteen on wall. \nWarily, he opens the bedside drawer: Different coloured bras and knickers. \nIn her open suitcase lies a small wooden chest. He lifts it out and puts it on the bed, hesitates, then opens it. \nA pair of Russian Army field binoculars. He puts them on the bed beside him. A small silver pistol, the size of a Derringer. He studies it, and pulls the trigger. It's a cigarette lighter. \nA brochure of prospective husbands provided by the marriage agency. After a dozen or so photos he comes across his page but the photo has been cut out. He sees his name in the strange lettering, under the hole. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nNadia in the shower, eyes shut, water pouring over her face. \nINT. NADIA'S ROOM - DAY \nJohn flicks through a stack of photographs. One of Nadia as a young girl in a meadow, with binoculars around her neck -- John looks at the same binoculars on the bed next to him. He turns them over in his hands. \nHe looks through them. He slowly lowers them. He's seen something. He stands and crosses the room. \nOn the mantelpiece, in a silver frame, is his picture, cut from the brochure. He holds it in his hands. \nThe shower has stopped. In a panic he replaces the picture, the photographs, the gun lighter, the brochure, and the binoculars. \nINT. LANDING - DAY \nNadia leaves the bathroom, hair wrapped in a towel, and heads straight towards us. \n", "test2_true": "John shuts the chest, drops it back into the suitcase. \nThe photo of the binoculars girl is on the pillow. He whips it under the bed just as Nadia enters. \nShe doesn't seem surprised to see him standing there, in her room, in his tee shirt and running shorts. \nJOHN Nadia. This isn't going to work. I'm sorry. It's been a terrible mistake. You must go. \nHe takes the ring off and holds it out to her. She doesn't take it. He puts it on the bed. \nJOHN I'm booking a flight for tomorrow. I'm sorry. \nJohn and Nadia on her bed, Nadia tearing off his tee shirt. She gets on top. \nEXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - DAY \nThe milkman hops a low fence between two houses.

NATWEST BANK, ST ALBANS - DAY \nThe large oak doors of the bank swing open. \nVOICE OVER Most of the time he develops several alternative solutions to problems... \nWe move fast through the banking hall to the furthest counter. The blind snaps up to reveal John, wearing a smart suit. \nVOICE OVER He usually resolves or minimises most problems before they grow into larger problems... \nINT. BEHIND THE GLASS - DAY \nJohn's skilled hands loading a stack of banknotes into a drawer. The cashier next along, Clare, smiles at him. \nCLARE Good weekend? \nJOHN Uh. Yeah. Pretty good. \nCLARE Do anything special? \nJOHN Uh. No. \nVOICE OVER Communications. John listens and comprehends well. \nINT.

SMALLER MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY \nTied to the radiator, gagged with duct tape, is Nadia. \nJohn looks down at her. She looks away as her eyes fill with tears. \nHe sits on the bed facing her. They stay like that for a long moment before he reaches over and starts untying her knots. He peels the tape off her mouth. Suddenly he slaps her across the face. \nHer head hits the radiator. Nadia gasps hard from the shock of the blow. Without warning she slaps his face, equally hard. \nThis starts a long silent fight; kicking, hitting, biting, a real struggle. \nIts intensity is almost sexual, but has the edge of real violence. They end up on opposite sides of the room, both panting, hurt and beaten. \nNADIA (in English) Great. You've split my fuckin, lip. \nJohn lies there on the floor, panting, and he hears the English words. \nExhausted, John stands, wipes his mouth, and rushes her anew. Nadia dodges out the way and cuffs him painfully on the ear. The whole fight starts again and ends only when neither has the strength to go on. Nadia staggers into the bathroom where she shuts the door and begins to sob uncontrollably. John lies on the bed listening to her cry. \nEXT. DUAL CARRIAGEWAY - DAY \nThe mid morning traffic flows by on the dual carriageway. \nINT. HAPPY EATER - DAY \nNadia and John sit in silence in the half empty diner. Nadia has a cut lip and a graze on her chin. John has a Thousand Yard Stare and a lesion over his left cheekbone. \nThe Waitress comes over. \nWAITRESS Good morning. What can I get you? \nNADIA I'll have an espresso, with a small pastry, a croissant or something. \nWAITRESS We only do a croissant with the Continental breakfast. \nNADIA Just get me a coffee. \nWAITRESS One coffee. And for you Sir ? \nJohn doesn't answer. \nNADIA He'll have a coffee. \nThe waitress leaves them. Nadia lights a cigarette and they sit in tense silence, the pain of betrayal, and recent violence, thick in the air. \nJOHN You can't smoke in here. \nNadia ignores him. John bellows \nJOHN YOU CAN'T SMOKE IN HERE! \nThe diner falls silent, people stare. She takes a last drag and crushes the butt on the floor. A waitress comes over and puts down two coffees. \nNADIA I don't expect you to understand. \nIt seems as if John has no intention of replying. He sips his coffee, and puts it down. He begins speaking very calmly. \nJOHN Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber. \nNADIA You don't understand anything. \nJOHN I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously. \nHe sips his coffee. \nJOHN Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee. \nNADIA It's makes it easier. Okay. \nJOHN I don't want to know. \n", "test3_true": "JOHN That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy. \nPause. \nNADIA So what are you going to do? \nJOHN I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison. \nNADIA They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank. \nJOHN Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me. \nNADIA Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute. \nJOHN Well as it turns out I did. \nShe slaps his face. He slaps hers back. The waitress comes over. \nWAITRESS More coffee? \nJOHN Yes please. \nNADIA No. \nShe pours for John. \nJOHN Splendid. Thank you. \nWAITRESS Pleasure. \nShe smiles and leaves them. John watches her walk away. \nNADIA John, I need your help. \nThis really tickles John. He has to put his coffee down. \nJOHN You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world. \nNADIA No I don't. \nJOHN In the world. \nNADIA I know you just want to punish me -- \nJOHN I do. I want to very badly. \nNADIA So you're just going to be vindictive \nJOHN In every sense. If at all possible. \nNADIA You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already. \nJOHN Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash. \nPause. \nNADIA My name isn't Nadia. \nJohn stares back at her. \nEXT.

37   CLOSE ON COBB                                                37 He laughs, cackling madly at Stump. 
COBB Drive, motherfucker, drive! 
38   STUMP'S POV                                                  38 The black Chrysler rushes down the mountain into the raging storm. 
STUMP struggles to see through the windshield -- snow is swirling everywhere. 
STUMP'S POV Cobb's car disappears into the blizzard, fishtailing as it goes. 
BACK TO SCENE STUMP Jesus... 
39   EXT. HIGHWAY                                                 39 
Stump's car creeps along the edge of a deep ravine that plunges to a raging, icy river. The car fishtails, straightens, and continues on, slowly groping down the mountain. 
40   CLOSE ON STUMP                                               40 
Sheer terror. It takes his full powers of concentration to keep the car on the road. STUMP (to himself) He's a goner, Al, save your own God damn ass... (CONTINUED) 
40   CONTINUED:                                                  40 CLOSER ON STUMP 
He sees something. 
41   EXT. HIGHWAY                                                41 
His car lights reveal tire tracks in the snowdrifts on the highway. The tracks skid wildly, clearly out of control, and head straight off the road. 
42   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               42 Stump stops his car and gets out -- He hurries to the edge of the road where the bank drops away quickly. 
POV SHOT - COBB'S CAR lies nose down at the bottom of a snow-filled ravine, thirty feet away. The tail lights are still on. The car is totalled. 
BACK TO SCENE STUMP Cobb! Stump plows his way on foot down the embankment, fighting bad footing and snowdrifts, until -- He arrives at the car -- Surely nobody could survive this. With difficulty, he makes his way to the back door of the huge car and wrestles it open. 
Stump sticks the top half of his body into the car. STUMP Cobb? 
Cobb lies upside down, ass in the air, his face buried under the dash of the car. There's blood on his face. 
COBB It's about fucking time you got here! STUMP You've alive? 
Cobb struggles to right himself, twisting and turning free. 
(CONTINUED) 
42   CONTINUED:                                                    42 COBB I wouldn't call it living but it'll do. Help me outta here. Stump helps Cobb back out of the car.    It is an awkward, clumsy, difficult task. 
STUMP There's blood! COBB Of course there's blood! I just put my head through the windshield of a car, what the hell ya think, ya big fucking jerk. 
STUMP Shut up! COBB Ty Cobb can't die like this! They'll bury me and nobody'll know who it is! 
STUMP I said shut up. Stump drags Cobb awkwardly through the snowbank back up to the highway. When they get to the edge of the high- way, Cobb stops to stare at the tire tracks leaving the road. COBB Look't that! No guard rail! I'm suing the State Highway Commission, I'm suing the Governor, I'm suing every God damn body! (outraged) I coulda been killed! STUMP God damn it, shut up and get in the car! The blizzard swirls around the two men, now at Stump's car on the highway. 
COBB Gimme your keys, I'm driving. 
STUMP I'm driving. (CONTINUED) 
42   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              42 COBB Do you know how to get to Reno? Hell, no! I'm driving. STUMP Over my dead body!

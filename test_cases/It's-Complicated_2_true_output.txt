GABBY So weird. Still is. 
JAKE I loved tonight. 
GABBY Yeah. That's why it was so weird. Just seeing you in your robe in our kitchen. Remember when you weren't even allowed in. Mom used to go out to the car to talk to you... 
LUKE (handing Gabby his Tupperware) You know, I don't even really remember you and Mom as a couple. 
JAKE What do you mean... you were ten when we broke up. 
LUKE I was eight actually and I don't know...it's all foggy to me now. 
JAKE You don't remember us in Hawaii or all sleeping in that tent in the backyard. 
LUKE Yeah, of course, but I don't remember like you and Mom hugging or waking up together... 
Jake grabs his heart, moans. 
LUKE -- It's okay. I'm not damaged or anything. You've been good parents... 
GABBY Speak for yourself dude. I'm definitely damaged from the divorce. 
Harley and Lauren ENTER.   Lauren turns the tea kettle on. 
LAUREN Hello troops. 
JAKE Why are you still here? 
LAUREN I don't know, you and Mom sleeping in the same house. Harley thought we should stay. 
Jake turns his beams on Harley. 
HARLEY She exaggerates. I just thought perhaps you might want to talk later, or ... Is that the noodle thing? 
JAKE Oh. Sorry. I think I ate it all. 
GABBY Dad! 
JAKE I didn't know anyone wanted any. 
102   INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER                        102 Jane, sits on her bed, talking to Adam via iSight. On her LAPTOP SCREEN, we see Adam but he's a bit of a BLUR. 
JANE Wait, I can't see that one.    Can you back up a little? 
CLOSE ON JANE'S LAP TOP SCREEN - ADAM IN HIS BEDROOM 
He back ups from the lens and models a rather ridiculous ski sweater. 
JANE (hmmm) Very festive... 
ADAM O-kay. Thank you. (into lens) Gift from my ex-sister-in-law. Have no idea why I kept it. (pulls sweater off) Into the pile. Hey, check out the pile, Jane. 
Adam POINTS HIS LAPTOP to the floor to show a HUGE STACK OF OLD CLOTHES. 
JANE Nice! (then) Hey, the pile's moving.... 
ADAM Murphy, get out of there! 
A small Mutt scurries out of the pile.   Jane laughs. ADAM (re-enters in an odd shirt) What about this?   I was in India and I had it made. (MORE) ADAM(cont'd) The guy ran out of fabric so he didn't make me long sleeves. (looks down) Or short sleeves. It's weird.

BABE 
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them? 
LONGFELLOW 
I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12] 
(awkwardly) 
Except you, of course. 
(a pause) 
People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live 
(thoughtfully; leans back) 
Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them. 
145. REVERSE ANGLE 
Favoring Babe. She stares at him curiously. 
LONGFELLOW 
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls. 
BABE 
I'm from a small town too, you know. 
LONGFELLOW 
(interested) 
Really? 
BABE 
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls. 
LONGFELLOW 
(finding a kindred soul) 
Gosh! What do you know about that! 
Babe leans her head back in a reminiscent mood. We get a feeling that, for the moment, she has forgotten she is Babe Bennett, out on a story. 
BABE 
Ah, it's a beautiful little town, too. A row of poplar trees right along Main Street. Always smelled as if it just had a bath. 
146. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO 
Longfellow watches her face intently. 
BABE 
I've often thought about going back. 
LONGFELLOW 
You have? 
BABE 
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain." 
LONGFELLOW 
He sounds like a person worth while knowing. 
There is a pause while Longfellow watches her, and she is lost in thought. 
BABE 
(continuing) 
He played in the town band, too. 
LONGFELLOW 
He did? I play the tuba 
BABE 
Yeah, I know. 
LONGFELLOW 
What did he play? 
BABE 
The drums. He taught me to play some. 
LONGFELLOW 
He did? 
BABE 
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me? 
LONGFELLOW 
(enthusiastically) 
Sure! 
147. MEDIUM SHOT 
She picks up a couple of branches. With the two sticks she drums on the bench seat - and sings "Swanee River." 
When she is finished, though clearly delighted, he shows her a long face of mock-disappointment. 
BABE 
Oh, I suppose you could do better. 
LONGFELLOW 
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque." 
BABE 
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes. 
LONGFELLOW 
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you. 
BABE 
It had better be good. 
She starts again, and he sings "Humoresque" in counterpoint to her drumming. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARK - BEHIND SOME BUSHES 
148. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND FRANK 
They wait with their camera. When they hear the singing, they look up, and then at each other in surprise. 
BOB 
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet. 
FRANK 
Shhh! 
149. MEDIUM SHOT 
Longfellow and Babe. They are having a grand time with their singing. A policeman saunters into the scene and stands watching them for a few seconds, without their being conscious of his presence. He smiles, shakes his head and passes on out of scene. Over the shot we hear the low moan of a siren in the distance. 
150. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO 
They reach the climax of their song - and laugh joyously. At this moment, the shrieking of the siren is nearer and louder. Longfellow looks up quickly. Excited, he jumps up and runs toward street. Babe looks up, surprised. 
LONGFELLOW 
(as he runs off) 
Fire engine! Fire engine! I want to see how they do it. Wait for me, will you? 
151. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND FRANK BEHIND BUSHES 
Frank grabs the camera. 
FRANK 
Looks like the evening is not going to be wasted! 
152. MEDIUM SHOT 
They dash by the policeman, who looks up, startled. 
153. LONG SHOT 
As the fire engine slows down - and people are beginning to gather. We see Longfellow running toward the truck and hopping aboard. 
154. MED. SHOT AT FIRE TRUCK 
As Longfellow jumps on. 
FRANK 
Hello - what do you want? 
LONGFELLOW 
(short salute) 
Captain Deeds - fire volunteer - Mandrake Falls. 
FIREMAN 
(amused) 
Hi, Cap! Boys, meet the Captain! 
155. LONG SHOT - REVERSE ANGLE 
Bob and Frank running with their cameras toward Longfellow. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM OF MABEL DAWSON'S STUDIO 
156. CLOSEUP 
Of typewriter carriage. It contains a paper upon which the following is typed: 
"CINDERELLA MAN FIRE-EATING DEMON" 
"Longfellow Deeds, 'The Cinderella Man,' last night threw a 'defy' into the teeth of the New York Fire Department, that when it comes to extinguishing conflagrations - they had better look to their laurels" 
CAMERA PULLS BACK and we find Babe, staring at the sheet of paper in front of her. Her eyes have a distant look. 
157. FULL SHOT

{"test1_input": "WINK (CONT'D) Come on. One more time. \nINT. EDISON'S HOUSE - FLOODED - NIGHT \nHushpuppy has enclosed herself under a table with a tablecloth on it. She's drawing on the floor with charcoal. \nSomething alive hits the roof and scurries across. We hear the entire house MOAN, or was it a distant ROAR? \nHUSHPUPPY Daddy? \nWink's hacking cough, which has gotten worse since last we heard it, fills the room. Hushpuppy tries to shake him awake. \nHushpuppy looks through the gap in his shirt. \nOn Wink's chest, surrounding his heart, a corroded spider web of purple bruises shows through the skin, like varicose veins covering his entire heart. \nHushpuppy's eyes go wide with horror. \nEXT. EDISON'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe beacon pulses on the distant horizon. \nHUSHPUPPY Mamma? Is that you? \nThe beacon does not respond. \nHUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) I've broken everything. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nA cloud of dust circulates particles. The Haze is blinding. A distant RUMBLING grows. \nDark shapes tear through the haze in a deafening stampede. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Strong animals, they know when your hearts are weak. That makes them hungry and they start coming. \nWe see one at first, then more join rank around it. The Aurochs are charging in a pack. They are a biblical terror; the horsemen of the apocalypse. \nEXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY \nThe turck moves through the cypress forest, signs are strewn everywhere pointing to Lady Jo's bar. It appears abandoned. \nSuddenly, the door SQUEAKS open. Walrus winces at the sunlight and pops a beer. \nHe steps out the door and SPLASHES into the water. \nWALRUS Holy bowlegged Sarah! \nWINK Hey partner! Hey Walrus! \nWink pulls in the Turck and paddles to rescue the thrashing drunkard. \nThey leverage Walrus aboard and lay him out on deck. \nWALRUS (gauging his surroundings) I musta passed out. \nWink starts chuckling silently. His chuckle builds to a laugh. \n", "test1_true": "They enter the bar, empty bottles, half eaten crabs, and general party debris are littered everywhere. \nLittle Jo is sprawled on the floor under a table. Is she dead or just wasted? \nWINK Little Jo! \nShe awakes with a start and bangs her head on the table. \nLITTLE JO Wink!? \nWink and Walrus run to help her up. \nLITTLE JO (CONT'D) (TO WALRUS) You don't touch me you filthy bastard! (TO WINK) Wink, you get me. \nThey both lift her. \nLITTLE JO (CONT'D) Goin' on all night `bout how tonight's the last night on earth we gotta make it count. Talkin' dirty right in front of Peter T. \nWALRUS Sorry Peter T. \nPeter T enters from the Bathroom. \nWINK Peter T, my man! I knew you wasn't gonna leave me man! \nPeter T speaks in his polite, level-headed, soft sweet voice. \nPETER T Oh no, oh no. \nWALRUS (re: Peter T) That is one classic dude right there. \nWINK Peter T, you are a titan! Glad you stayed man! RHHAAAA! \nWink jiggles Peter T's ample belly. Peter T giggles with glee. \nWink puts one arm around Walrus and the other around Peter T. He smiles to Hushpuppy. \nShe laughs too, the first smile in quite some days. \nINT. LADY JO'S BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT \nThe Bathtub crew are lolling in the later party stages. There is a rooster on the table looking like the most sober creature in the room by far. \nWALRUS If I had wings, I know I could have flown in that bad boy. But I would have probably bounced off a tree, or... \nHushpuppy lays on the table in pile of empty crab shells. \nWINK Hushpuppy! Did I ever tell you the story of your conception? \nThe bar crowd chuckles. \nWINK (CONT'D) When me and Hushpuppy's Mamma first met we was so shy, we used to sit around, and drink beer, and smile at each other. One day we was so shy we just napped... \nWink's voice FADES DOWN as Hushpuppy's fantasy takes over. She closes her eyes. \nEXT. FANTASY HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY \n", "test1_id": 2379, "test2_input": "BABYSITTER Hushpuppy needs a hug. \nHUSHPUPPY I don't want your hug! \nThe Babysitter squeezes Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy tries to squirm away. \nBABYSITTER Hushpuppy, that's not how nice girls act. Say \"I'm sorry ma'am.\" Hey! Say it. Say it or you're going to corner time. \nHushpuppy's eyes meet Wink's and she freezes at his horrifying appearance. \nWink grabs a sofa trying to stop the wheelchair as it rolls by. His fingers slips off, too weak to hold on. He tries to scream and nothing but a SEDATED MOAN comes out of his mouth. He tries to pull the tubes out of his arm. \nORDERLY (gently moving Wink's hand AWAY) There there, sir. \nHushpuppy stares in shock as Wink is wheeled away. \nINT. REFUGEE CAMP - WINK'S ROOM - NIGHT \nHushpuppy watches in hiding as a hand covered in a rubber glove changes the bandage on a surgical scar; it looks infected and mishandled. \nThe same hand puts pills in Wink's mouth. \nINT. REFUGEE CAMP - TERMINAL WARD - DAY \nHushpuppy stands over an old man on an artificial respirator. She's creeps closer, examining him. She puts her head on his chest. His heart is beating. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When an animal gets sick here, they plug it into the wall. \nShe whispers in his ear. \nHUSHPUPPY They're coming for you. \nINT. REFUGEE CAMP - TERMINAL WARD - A DIFFERENT BED - DAY \nShe repeats the process with another vegetable. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy says, if he ever got so old he couldn't drink beer, or catch catfish, that I had to put him in a boat, and set him on fire, so no one could come plug him into the wall. \nINT. REFUGEE CAMP - WINK'S ROOM - NIGHT \nHushpuppy peeks through the curtains at another terminal bed. \nShe sees two orderlies force pills into Wink's mouth. He's regaining his strength and is able to hold them off momentarily before submitting, and going limp. \nHushpuppy bolts, unable to take it. \nWe stay in the room as the orderlies walk away. \nWink peeks to make sure they're gone, then spits his pills on the floor. \nWink stares at the ceiling for a long beat. Then, with a burst of energy he grabs his morphine drip and topples himself onto the floor. He pulls his wires out. \nINT. REFUGEE CAMP - KID'S ROOM - MORNING \nHushpuppy lies asleep in a pile with Tee-Lou, Lizard, and Joy. Wink enters and jostles her awake. \nWINK Boss. Let's go. \n", "test2_true": "INT. REFUGEE CAMP - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nWink and the girls hustle to the entrance of the Refugee center. \nWalrus comes running down the hall, pushing Peter T on a gurney. \nWink looks bewildered, the rest of the team seems to have their own plan afoot. \nINT. REFUGEE CAMP - COTS - MORNING \nJean Battiste and Little Jo charge through the cots riling refugees into revolt as the orderlies chase them trying to maintain decorum. \nJEAN BATTISTE Go home! Everybody get up! Don't you want to go home? Lets go! These people don't care about you! \nLittle Jo fights off an orderly with a syringe. \nLITTLE JO You live in this hell hole! \nINT/EXT. REFUGEE CAMP - EVACUATION BUS - DAY \nWink runs the kids toward the bus, they pass two busses labeled for Salt Lake City, Des Moines. \nWink helps Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard get on. Then Hushpuppy. \nSuddenly Wink's hand slips out of Hushpuppy's. He steps away from the evacuating bus. Hushpuppy turns and the bus door slams between them. \nWINK (from outside the door) Make sure you put her somewhere good ok? \nWink sags. He's giving her away. He turns to leave.. \nHUSHPUPPY (banging on the door) NO! I ain't running! No! \nWink walks away from the bus, his chest heaving, his face clutched in the horror of what he's done. \nBehind him, the bus pulls forward, then veers violently. \nHushpuppy charges the driver clawing at her face, punching and kicking. \nHUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) Let me go! \nThe driver pulls the break and Hushpuppy bangs the doors open. \nShe charges Wink from behind, gives him a diving shove. \nHe topples over. \nHUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) You trying to get rid of me! You trying to get rid of me! \nWINK No! \nHUSHPUPPY Why you trying to get rid of me? \nWINK I ain't trying to get rid of you. \nHUSHPUPPY You is. \n", "test2_id": 2380, "test3_input": "The Aurochs ROARS. Then, inches away from Hushpuppy, she stops. She SNORTS, blowing Hushpuppy's hair back. Hushpuppy doesn't flinch. \nThe Aurochs stares face to face with Hushpuppy. Sniffs. \nEXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY \nWink is frozen in wonder, unable to believe his eyes. \nEXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY \nHushpuppy raises her chin in confident defiance. \nNow in full profile, we see the Aurochs towering 15-feet tall, she takes a step forwards, sniffs again. A low SNORT, or is it a purr? \nThe Aurochs lowers her head with respect. \nHer eyes well with emotion, recognizing one of her own. A ferocious warrior. \nThe Aurochs steps back, takes a knee, and with a BELLY FLOP that rattles the very earth, she lays down. Her three companions follow suit, their fat tummies settling into an almost joyful, lazy, repass. \nA strange calm has settled over Hushpuppy. Almost a smile, but more of a peace and an affection for her equal. They're both children in their way. \nHUSHPUPPY You're my friend, kind of. \nMother Aurochs grunts, a sentence only Hushpuppy can understand. \nHUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) I gotta take care of mine. \nWith weary and clumsy steps, the Aurochs stand and retreat. \nEXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY \nHushpuppy approaches the shacko. It's like walking the plank, but she's unafraid, at one with her destiny. \nThe Bathtub crew look on her in awe. They part ways to let her pass. \nShe reaches the door, steeling her reserve. \nHushpuppy opens the door. \nINT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY \nWink is curled up on Hushpuppy's bed-- very, very thin. His eyes are closed. His chest heaves up and down in short violent breaths. Hushpuppy stands and stares. \nWink looks at Hushpuppy in reverence. He knows it's the last time. \nWink motions for her to come closer. \nHushpuppy inches toward him. It takes all of her might. She sits on his bed. \nHushpuppy takes her to-go container from Elysian Fields out of a paper bag and pops it. She unwraps a gator nugget, dips it in hot sauce, and holds it out for Wink to take a bite. \nHushpuppy watches as Wink chews weakly. She eats one herself. \nWink and Hushpuppy draw it out. They don't want it to end. It takes a full minute for him to swallow the first bite, and she paces herself to finish when he does. \nWINK (BARELY AUDIBLE) Real good. \n", "test3_true": "WINK (CONT'D) (CHOKING UP) No crying, you hear? \nShe holds them back, being tough for her Daddy. \nHUSHPUPPY No crying. \nHushpuppy's face hardens, and even as the tears fall, we see a strength and composure that only Wink could have put there. \nShe falls into his arms and he embraces her. \nHushpuppy squeezes Wink. She does not let go. She stays strong. \nWink's hand trembles on her back. \nShe holds him as his deep, warm, heartbeat slows, slows, and stops. His weight slumps over her. She keeps on holding him, but she knows. \nEXT. GRAVEYARD BY THE WATER - DAY \nSteadfast, Hushpuppy holds a torch on the edge of the Bathtub. The Turck, piled with branches, floats in front of her. \nShe lowers the flame and lights a cloth covering Wink's body aflame. She pushes the funeral pyre out into the current. We watch the boat flames drift into the foreground, covering Hushpuppy face with flames. She looks into them in all her grief and wisdom. \nThe group begins a funeral prayer, playing quiet in the background as Hushpuppy contemplates the pyre. \nPETER T As I stand by the bayou, \nEveryone else joins him. \nEVERYONE A ship at my side starts her motors and sails for the gulf. I watch her until she disappears. \"There! (MORE) \nEVERYONE (CONT'D) She's gone!\" Gone where? Gone from my eyes, that's all. She's just as big as when she left me. And somewhere else, other voices are calling out, \"Here she comes!\" And that is dying. \nThey raise their drinks to the sky and shout in unison. \nEVERYONE (CONT'D) HERE! SHE! COMES! \nHushpuppy gazes into the sparks leaping off the top of the fire are foregrounded in front of Hushpuppy, particles of Wink jumping into the sky. HORNS ENTER, droning low, and building into an funeral dirge. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When I relax behind my eyes I see everything that made me flying around in invisible pieces. When I look too hard it goes away, but when it all goes quiet, I see they are right here. \nThe Turck almost disappears over the horizon. The HORNS take a hopeful turn, the melancholy of the dirge mixing with the anthem of the Bathtub. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) I see that I'm a little piece of a big, big universe, and that makes things right. \nHushpuppy stands tiny on the ledge of the Earth, framed in front of an expanse of endless water. \nEXT. CAUSEWAY - POST-FLOOD - DAY \nThe Bathtub gang marches across the marsh road. Hands touch the town sign, saying goodbye. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When I die, the scientists of the future, they gonna find it all. They gonna know, once there was a Hushpuppy, and she lived with her Daddy in the Bathtub. \nWe CUT WIDE to reveal that the water is rising and washing over the road. Our heroes are marching on the final sliver of land. The camera flies backwards, and our view of the road disappears into mist and churning waves. They appear to be walking on water. \nHushpuppy leads them forward, into the future. \n", "test3_id": 2381}

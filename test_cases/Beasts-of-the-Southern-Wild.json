{"train": "They stand on a long and crumbling road surrounded on both sides by water. The rag tag band of revelers charge forward WHOOPING and SHOUTING. \nHushpuppy kisses her hand and smacks the town sign. \"Isle de Charles Doucet\" is crossed out and someone has graffitied \"The Bathtub.\" Each party-goer repeats Hushpuppy's kiss and smack in wild, ritualistic fashion. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The Bathtub's got more holidays than the whole rest of the world. \nEXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY \nThe townspeople charge in a rousing parade. Everyone drags trails of beer cans, boat parts, anything they can tie to themselves that makes a lot of noise. \nThey are the hard faces of fishermen and their feisty wives, downtrodden but with a sense of fortitude among them, a community of heart, spirit, passion, and reckless abandon. \nWe see none of the separations that we're used to in modern society. There is no evidence of politics, religion, class, race or any other divisive ideology. The Bathtub is a place of true and honest unity. \nMegaphones sticking out a gutted mini-van broadcast the Cajun band playing inside. Fiddle, saw, guitar, and double-bass players struggle to hold onto their instruments and the truck bounces them down a dirt road. \nThey drive under a banner reading \"Welcome to the Bathtub Storm Season!\" \nWink and Hushpuppy rattle along on a float made from the front end of a pickup truck. Over the front cabin rears a giants sculpture of a horse-head made out of wooden spikes, metal plates, and heavy chains. Carnival-dressed maniacs clamber on top. \nWink hollers and waves to people. He fires jets of beer into the mouths of the crowd. \nHushpuppy dances on the back of the float. Though she's the tiniest member of this very adult parade, she's right in the thick of everything. No one is checking I.Ds Here. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy always saying, that up in the dry world, they got none of what we got. \nEXT. LAFOURCHE SQUARE - DAY \nThe town dances around the band in a clearing in the woods. Everyone is bouncing to the music, smiling and joking with one another. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They only got holidays once a year. \nSix babies, each with a racing number pinned to their diaper, are placed by their enthusiastic mammas at a starting-line on a track marked by two adjacent crowds of onlookers. Bets are flying between the spectators as if they're about to watch a cock-fight. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) All babies to the race! Come up to the starting line! The baby race is about to begin. \nHushpuppy dances in the cheering crowd, swigging a bottle of something she probably shouldn't have. \nA STARTING GUN fires, and the babies make a crawl for it. Most of them are paralysed in tears or bewilderment, but one brave soul toddles towards victory. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They got fish stuck in plastic wrappers, they got their babies stuck in carriages, and chickens on sticks and all that kind of stuff. \nHushpuppy looks up at Wink who is dancing with his best friend WALRUS (60), a slack jawed, white haired, pinked nosed, handsome devil. \nA baby crosses the finish line, ahead of the rest, victorious. The crowd goes wild. \nEXT. MARINA PAUPIER NET - NIGHT \nWink opens his trawl net and dumps a massive catch into a picking pan. There's food to feed a hundred in the haul. No one is a bit fazed though, this is just your average night fishing in the Bathtub. \nShrimp, crabs, and small leaping fish struggle over one another for dear life. \nHushpuppy helps him sort the catch. Winks's hands move with virtuosic ease, separating the crabs from the shrimp. She studies Wink's every move and tries to measure up to her Dad's proficiency. He doesn't demonstrate or explain anything, but we sense there is a system of education in place here. \nHushpuppy focuses in on a tiny fish, wriggling and sucking it's last breaths of air. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) One day, the storm's gonna blow, the ground's gonna sink, and the water's gonna rise up so high, there ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a whole bunch of water. \nShe points to a map showing a ragged coastline. On the wrong side of a giant line marked \"levee\" is an island labeled \"The Bathtub.\" \nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a whole bunch of water. Y'all better learn to survive. \nA mysterious COLD WIND fills the air. Hushpuppy stares into a wall poster of an ice cliff reading: THE SOUTH POLE. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Way back in the day, the Aurochs was king of the world. \nEXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF - DAY \nCRASH CUT to the PANORAMA of an ice cliff, but now it's real. \nWe CUT CLOSER to overwhelming white light accompanied by intermittent FROZEN CRACKS that build in frequency and volume. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) If it wasn't for giant snowballs, and the iced age. I wouldn't even be Hushpuppy, I would just be breakfast. \nThe light dims in intensity to reveal, frozen deep inside the ice wall, barely visible- a fanged, hairy, bloated, stone aged creature, the same as on Miss Bathsheba's leg. This is an Aurochs. \nINT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - EVENING \nHushpuppy climbs a metal ladder made from a railing, up to Wink's shanty in the trees. Windell, her dirty Chihuahua, follows behind. \nHUSHPUPPY Daddy? Feed-up time. Feed-up? \nHushpuppy bangs on the door of the shacko. \nHUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) Daddy? \nNothing. \nShe goes inside. \nThe house is empty. \nShe checks the Shacko for food. Nothing. \nEXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - EVENING \nSeveral hours later, Hushpuppy stands on a metal bin looking into the distance. \nHUSHPUPPY DADDY!? \nLike some sort of animal call, she SHRIEKS. \nINT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nHushpuppy draws a picture of Wink on a foldout mattress... \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Kids that got no Mamma, no Daddy and nobody. They got to live in the woods, and eat grass, and steal underpants. \nHushpuppy lays down next to her drawing of Wink. \nEXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - MORNING \nWindell, the Chihuahua and the potbelly pig awake to greet the day. \nHushpuppy peers into the ground floor of the shacko. \nMARIETTA'S VOICE Hushpuppy what you doing there? You being good like I taught you? \nHUSHPUPPY Yes, mamma. \nHushpuppy turns on the gas. \nHushpuppy goes through her safety precautions: oven mitts, a helmet, she flips the table and hides behind it. \nShe aims the stove lighter: a flame thrower made from a cigarette lighter and a can of spray deodorant. A spray of flames ignites the stove in a FIREBALL. \nCUT TO: \nMOMENTS LATER. Hushpuppy behind the bubbling stove. She ties on an apron and sways to the music. She is dressing like her mom. \nMarietta's Voice sings to her. \nMARIETTA'S VOICE You're good, you make me happy / you're good, you make me happy. \nHUSHPUPPY That's pretty Mamma. \nMARIETTA'S VOICE You're pretty Hushpuppy. \nHushpuppy stares into the floating islands of cat food frying in fat, which in her POV is a surreal churning vision, like the bubbling lava at the center of the earth. \nShe's SHOCKED out of her vision by a YOWLING CAT being flung across the yard. \nWINK (O.S) Get out of my way you fat animal! \nHushpuppy jumps down from the stove, grabs a bowl of water, and runs to greet Wink, \nEXT. WINK'S COMPOUND - MORNING \nShe clambers down the oil drum ladder spilling her water everywhere in her excitement. \nHUSHPUPPY Daddy! Daddy, Daddy! \nWink doesn't turn to acknowledge her as he trudges across the field toward his Shacko. He's wearing a hospital patient's smock and no shoes, it seems he checked himself out. \nHUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) I learned lots of stuff while you gone. If I drink all this here I can burp like a man. \nHushpuppy gulps down water, all of it. Wink keeps walking. Hushpuppy BURPS like a man, but he doesn't turn around. \nHushpuppy stops to examine the situation. Something's not right here. \nHUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) How come you wearing a dress? \nHushpuppy tugs his patient's smock and he shrugs her off violently. \nWINK Leave me alone, Man. \nShe sees his hospital I.D bracelet still on. \nHUSHPUPPY You wearing a bracelet too? \nWINK Go in your house, you wouldn't understand. \nHUSHPUPPY I wanna come in your house. \nEXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY \nSTRINGS SWELL under HOWLING WINDS. We follow behind a little boy running down the road with an alarm bell as the people of the Bathtub mobilize in a frenzied evacuation. \nBOY The storm's coming! The storm's coming! \nEXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY \nHushpuppy sulks out of the woods, feeling sorry for herself. She looks up and freezes like she's seen a ghost. \nWink hobbles down the road, looking shell-shocked. The traffic on the road moves in one direction: out. Wink walks back into town in the opposite direction. \nIn Hushpuppy's POV Wink arrives at Lady Jo's bar where a band of drunken sweethearts are in their regular positions. They are watching the evacuation go by like it's a Veteran's Day parade. They giggle and hurl good-natured curses out to a family making their way to safety. \nLITTLE JO Look at these assholes running around all over the damn place. C'est la vie assholes! \nWINK I know y'all with me. Y'all doin' the storm. \nLITTLE JO Lady Jo's ain't never closed honey. \nWINK That's what I'm talking about. Walrus my big man, you staying? \nWALRUS Wrong number buddy. I'm outta here as soon as I finish my beer. \nWink dismisses him with a wave of his hand. \nWINK You ain't goin nowhere. \nWALRUS This ain't no sneeze comin' out the gulf. I'm gone brother. \nWINK I'll see you tomorrow Walrus. Lookit there, Winston's with me. \nWINSTON is passed out on the stairs. \nWINK (CONT'D) What you doing about the storm Winston? \nWithout opening his eyes, Winston raises an umbrella over his head. Wink laughs. \nWALRUS Hey! It's Hushpuppy. \nEVERYBODY Hushpuppy! Hushpuppy's here. \nThey burst into a round of drunken applause. \nWINK Hushpuppy? Where you been? \nHUSHPUPPY What happened to y- \nWINK Shut-up! \nHe lifts her up by the britches and carries her away. \nWINK (CONT'D) You don't talk! \nINT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - GROUND FLOOR - DAY \nThrough the bus window, Hushpuppy watches Wink prepare for the storm as branches and debris fly by him. He RANTS to himself and drinks. He ties the Turck onto the house. \nHushpuppy runs to the window and peeks out. \nOUTSIDE. The frenzy of the hurricane propels Wink at full sprint through the 100 MPH winds. He tears his clothes off and guzzles moonshine as branches fall all around him. \nWINK (CONT'D) Look at me! Look at me Hushpuppy! Watch me kick butt. \nWink fires his shotgun at the heavens. \nWINK (CONT'D) Hell yea! I'm right here! I'm right here I ain't going nowhere. AHHHHHH!!! \nA THUNDER CLAP shakes the house so hard a ceiling beam CRASHES down. \nHushpuppy runs to her bed as if it might keep her safe. \nWindell, swinging from a basket tied to the ceiling, BARKS, panicking herself. \nHUSHPUPPY Mamma!? MAMMA!? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PATAGONIAN COAST - NIGHT \nStill in the rainstorm, a glacial cube SHATTERS, flopping a mammoth body onto the shoreline. \nIt's chest heaves and a LOW SNORT is heard. The animal begins to roll over. \nHer dinosaur size hoof plants in the mud as she lifts herself up. We stare over the muscular haunch of her body as she stares into the distance. \nThe massive creature turns, testing her limbs after thousands of years of sleep. \nShe looks up to the storm and lets loose a GURGLING ROAR. \nWe sit close on one of her black eyes. There is something dangerously sad in her cold gaze. Her head moves from the frame as she starts forward on her journey. \nEXT. AERIAL BATHTUB - DAY \nSilence. The storm has passed. \nThe camera flies high over the Bathtub. The tops of houses poke out from the massive water like lily-pads in a pond. \nEXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - FLOODED - MORNING \nA slab of metal stares at us, surrounded by water. \nSomething under the metal BANGS TWICE and an axe dislodges a roof panel. The axe twists and leverages off the slab. \nWink hefts Hushpuppy on top of the roof. Then Windell. Dishevelled and hung-over, he pulls himself up too. \nThe three survivors stare in stunned silence at their new world. \nEXT. FLOODED LAFOURCHE ROAD - TURCK - MORNING \nWink slowly navigates the Turck in through the flooded landscape where their town had once been. Neither he nor Hushpuppy can say a word. Everything is submerged. Every organism is dead or has fled. The quiet is overwhelming. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) For every animal that didn't have a Dad to put it in a boat, the end of the world already happened. They're all down below, trying to breathe through water. \nThey pass abandoned house, after abandoned house, the ones on stilts have water up to the porches. Trees are bashed through roofs, walls are blown through, bathrooms exposed. \nWINK (CONT'D) Come on. One more time. \nINT. EDISON'S HOUSE - FLOODED - NIGHT \nHushpuppy has enclosed herself under a table with a tablecloth on it. She's drawing on the floor with charcoal. \nSomething alive hits the roof and scurries across. We hear the entire house MOAN, or was it a distant ROAR? \nHUSHPUPPY Daddy? \nWink's hacking cough, which has gotten worse since last we heard it, fills the room. Hushpuppy tries to shake him awake. \nHushpuppy looks through the gap in his shirt. \nOn Wink's chest, surrounding his heart, a corroded spider web of purple bruises shows through the skin, like varicose veins covering his entire heart. \nHushpuppy's eyes go wide with horror. \nEXT. EDISON'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe beacon pulses on the distant horizon. \nHUSHPUPPY Mamma? Is that you? \nThe beacon does not respond. \nHUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) I've broken everything. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nA cloud of dust circulates particles. The Haze is blinding. A distant RUMBLING grows. \nDark shapes tear through the haze in a deafening stampede. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Strong animals, they know when your hearts are weak. That makes them hungry and they start coming. \nWe see one at first, then more join rank around it. The Aurochs are charging in a pack. They are a biblical terror; the horsemen of the apocalypse. \nEXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY \nThe turck moves through the cypress forest, signs are strewn everywhere pointing to Lady Jo's bar. It appears abandoned. \nSuddenly, the door SQUEAKS open. Walrus winces at the sunlight and pops a beer. \nHe steps out the door and SPLASHES into the water. \nWALRUS Holy bowlegged Sarah! \nWINK Hey partner! Hey Walrus! \nWink pulls in the Turck and paddles to rescue the thrashing drunkard. \nThey leverage Walrus aboard and lay him out on deck. \nWALRUS (gauging his surroundings) I musta passed out. \nWink starts chuckling silently. His chuckle builds to a laugh. \nWink, younger and prettier, naps in an uncharacteristically colorful lawn chair. \nA LOW, GURGLING GROWL wakes him up. \nThere in the yard, crawling slow and lazy, is a massive 15- foot alligator, breathing the heavy, slutty way alligators breathe. \nA topless woman steps in front. Sweat beading on her perfect shoulder blades, down her perfect, back ending in a pair of boys' underpants- just like Hushpuppy's. \nThroughout Hushpuppy's vision, we never see Marietta's face, it's always covered, shot from the back, or out of frame. \nMarietta cocks the shotgun with one hand, Terminator 2 style. \nLowers it on the gator... \nBLAM. Wink sits up in SLOW MOTION- her panties, and her long naked legs are covered with gator blood. \nShe turns to Wink, her head ABOVE FRAME. \nCLOSE UP on her eye. She winks. \nINT. FANTASY HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWe follow behind Marietta's supple curves as she walks into the kitchen. Her white slip is almost see through...almost. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Back when Daddy used to talk about Mamma, he'd say she was so pretty she never even had to turn on the stove. \nShe runs her fingers along the counter and the burners IGNITE one by one as she passes. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) She just walk into a room and water start to boil. \nWater starts to bubbles like a spontaneous volcanic eruption. \nMarietta reaches into the frigidaire, and pulls out two ice- cold beers. \nIce melts down the bottles. \nShe opens them on the counter, flawlessly. \nShe walks over to Wink. Stands there. A hot mess. \nWink's voice FADES UP. \nWINK (V.O.) Your Momma battered that gator up, and set it to fry. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LADY JO'S BAR - NIGHT \nWink tips his drink. \nWINK ...and Hushpuppy popped into the universe maybe four minutes later. \nHe empties the glass, sufficiently drunk now. \nWINK (CONT'D) I got it under control. \nWink looks away, lost in his own fantasy. \nLITTLE JO You ain't drinkin' no water. \nMiss Bathsheba pour shots and toasts. \nMISS BATHSHEBA Yea, tastes like more, alright! \nHushpuppy struggles to peel her shrimps, sitting on top of the table. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) For the ones we'd never find, we make a funeral the Bathtub way, with no crying allowed. \nDrunken Wink is giving drunken Walrus a bath as he eats. \nWALRUS When the water goes down, I'm gonna French kiss the dirt! \nMISS BATHSHEBA Water's not goin' down man. \nWINK Nah, that's my beautiful place under there. \nMISS BATHSHEBA Man you know they got plenty of salt coming into that water, everything beautiful is gone. Trees are gonna dies first, then the animals, then the fish. \nWINK I got it under control. \nHushpuppy picks up a crab. She tries to pound it open, tries yanking on a leg. She can't shell it. \nJEAN BATTISTE Come on Hushpuppy, come over here lemme show you how. \nHushpuppy sits down next to Jean, a good pupil. \nJEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D) Here baby. You hold like this, then you turn it over like that. \nHushpuppy follows instruction in deep concentration, but a bit tentative. \nWe see Wink look away from Walrus and Jo's bawdy humor extravaganza and focus in on Hushpuppy. His disdain is palpable for this froufrou shelling technique. \nJEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D) Don't be scared of it now. Now, you take this knife, and you pop this off. \nJean holds Hushpuppy's hand and guides a knife to open the belly of the crab. \nJEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D) Atta girl. \nWINK NO! Hushpuppy-- \nWink POUNDS the table. And the party falls suddenly silent. \nWink pushes the utensil away. He grabs a crab, opens it in three virtuosic hand motions. \nGrease and spice explode everywhere and Wink sucks the face of the crab clean. It is beautiful to watch. \nHe slams a fresh crab in front of Hushpuppy. \nWINK (CONT'D) Beast it! \nHushpuppy looks to Miss Bathsheba for guidance. \nMISS BATHSHEBA You heard your Daddy. Beast it. \nHushpuppy pulls on the crab shell with all her might. She doesn't have the power. \nTee-Lou returns and pours water on Lizard's head, cooling her. \nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) This is most important thing I can ever teach y'all. You got to take care of people that's smaller and sweeter than you are. \nHushpuppy registers this advice, takes it to heart. She rubs Lizard's chest with delicacy and affection. \nLizard's breathing returns to normal, and she sits up peacefully. Hushpuppy is awestruck. Bathsheba gets to her feet. \nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) That's better. \nINT. SCHOOLHOUSE - NIGHT \nHushpuppy watches Wink sleeping. His breathing has gotten worse. \nShe tiptoes up with her red basketball jersey and lays it down on Wink, tucking him in just right. \nA DISTANT RUMBLING is heard. Cutting off suddenly as we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BRAZILIAN FAVELLAS - DAY \nA quiet town, not unlike the Bathtub, but with tangled power- lines, electrical towers, and layered hills. \nA stone flies from behind a house and bounces down the street, denting the silence. \nSlowly, the peaceful morning transitions into MORE RUMBLING, a distant CRACK. \nSuddenly the house in the foreground explodes to smithereens and the head of an Aurochs drives through it. \nWithout breaking step, Aurochs maraud the village, trampling it into oblivion. We settle close on an Aurochs eye, emotionless and relentless in its calm. \nEXT. BATHTUB MARSH WATER - TURCK - MORNING \nWink, Hushpuppy, and the Bathtub crew pole the Turck through a lake blanketed with carcasses, pushing through the dead fish, dead porpoises, dead alligator garfish like they were lily pads. There is no wind, only dense wet heat searing on the faces of the characters. The once green foliage has gone brown and thirsty. \nHUSHPUPPY V.O. Two weeks later, everything started to die. \nWINK (to the water) Come on fishes, where y'at? \nWink empties his net- nothing but a pile of carcasses. He tips it back into the water. Wink pulls himself to the edge and sticks his head under to look for fish. \nHushpuppy looks at him with an air of doubt for the first time. Wink looks ridiculous, a dead fish drifts off his head. \nHUSHPUPPY (WHISPERING) You wanna leave the Bathtub, Walrus? \nWALRUS (WITHOUT THOUGHT) Nah. \nWink pulls his head back up. \nWINK I heard that. \nHushpuppy fidgets guiltily. \nWINK (CONT'D) Nobody's leaving the Bathtub! You don't know nothing! \nWink lowers his net back in the water. \nWater recedes in the Bathtub, revealing the tragic, mud- soaked remnants of their paradise. \nHushpuppy slogs through the muck, each step going two feet down into the stinking filth. \nThe crew trudges behind her in silence. \nEXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY \nThe blow-up crew crests a hill and sees the remains of the ark sprawled across an open field. \nWink's and Hushpuppy's eyes well up as they beholds the state of their island. The water has drained. Everything is dead. \nMore striking than the ripped-up houses, the land surrounding the island has disappeared. Trees are gone. Shards of marsh that had been attached float in the distance. What was a dense, green landscape is barren. The Bathtub is a scorched hell. \nEXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST-FLOOD - EVENING \nHushpuppy picks through the rubble of the Shacko in the Backo. She finds their grill, and a window made from a dryer door and brings them to Wink. \nThe Shacko has crash landed under the stilts of a house that's been entirely washed away. Wink has done some work reassembling the walls and broken parts into a semi- functional enclosure. \nEXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST-FLOOD - LATER THAT NIGHT \nHushpuppy find nails and brings them to Wink, who leans wall panels against the stilts from the previous house. \nHe hammers nails wearily. His strength is sapped. He HACKS out bile. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) It didn't matter that the water was gone. Sometimes, you can break something so bad, that it can't get put back together. \nINT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - EVENING \nHushpuppy climbs the stairs of the original house to get to the top of the Shacko. \nShe looks down through the hole in the floor. \nIn her POV Wink climbs into bed, he painfully takes his shirt off. The bruise on his chest has extended all the way across his stomach. \nHushpuppy looks out on the water for some sign that Marietta's still with her. The light shining on the water is off. She sees nothing but dead trees and a defunct oil rig. \nHUSHPUPPY Mamma!? \nNothing. \nHUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) Mamma where you at!? \nAs if in response, we hear a HELICOPTER LOUDSPEAKER. \nPILOT This is a mandatory evacuation area, you can no longer live here. Everyone in this area, has to leave. I repeat.... \nEXT. DEAD FOREST - MORNING \nHushpuppy wades through the muck in what used to be a lush forest, now reduced to toothpick trees and mud. \nShe finds her storage unit in the tree hollow, and lifts out the medicine jar. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When you're small, you gotta fix what you can. \nINT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - NIGHT \nWink's smiles disappears. \nWINK Hey. No crying. Don't you cry man. Don't you cry! \nHe threatens her with a shoe. Hushpuppy hides behind an overturned chest. \nWINK (CONT'D) HEY! Don't cry damn it! \nWink hangs his head and catches his breath against the wall. \nWINK (CONT'D) Shit. \nHe pull himself to his feet and grabs a bottle of moonshine. \nHe sets up two cups on the table. \nWINK (CONT'D) Come on get a drink. \nWink pours Hushpuppy a shot. \nHushpuppy sips. Winces. Looks suspiciously at her father. Sips again. \nWink takes one straight from the bottle. \nWINK (CONT'D) This counts as I'm sorry for a whole buncha things. Lord. \nHUSHPUPPY You gonna be gone? \nWINK What? No! \nHUSHPUPPY You gonna leave me alone? \nWINK I ain't gon' leave nothing. \nHUSHPUPPY Cause if you be gone, I be gone too. \nWINK Hushpuppy, that is not how it works. \nHUSHPUPPY I will. Sometimes in the bed I start shaking and can't stop. I got what you got. \nWINK No man. That's just a side effect of being a stupid little girl. \nHUSHPUPPY I ain't gonna be dead? \nWINK No. You? No! You gonna live a hundred years more. You know what, show me the guns. \nHushpuppy shoves Wink. \nWINK (CONT'D) Show me them guns man. \nWink clears everything off the table with one sweep. \nWINK (CONT'D) Show me the guns! Guns! guns! guns! guns! guns! \nHushpuppy flexes her biceps. She begins to chant, fierce and TRIUMPHANT-- \nHUSHPUPPY Guns! Guns! Guns! Guns!..... \nThe Aurochs move into a desolate, barren, wasteland, looking exhausted and starved. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Strong animals got no mercy. \nCold wind blows them backwards. An old Aurochs falls behind the pack. Its legs give out and it lays down. It's not going to make it. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They the type of animals that eats their own Mommas and Daddies. \nCUT TO: \nThe Aurochs cannibalize their fallen comrade, ripping skin and organs in a storm of flesh and gore. \nThe CRIES of the screaming mother melt together with another, sound, more MECHANICAL... \nINT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - MORNING \nThe SOUND becomes recognizable as a HELICOPTER PROPELLER. \nHushpuppy opens her eyes, still tucked in Wink's arm. Through the wall she sees FOUR WELL-DRESSED men. They are out of place like aliens exiting their space ship. \nShe rouses Wink, he hears the FOREIGN SOUNDING VOICES and yanks Hushpuppy up. He instinctively pulls him and Hushpuppy behind the over-turned table and grabs a broken chair leg to defend them with. \nEVACUATOR (O.S.) (from outside the door) This is a mandatory evacuation area. Everyone in this region has to leave. \nWink hurls the chair leg at the intruders as they try to enter. \nWINK We ain't going nowhere! \nHushpuppy grabs a chair leg as well. It's a standoff. \nINT. LADY JO'S HOUSE - POST FLOOD - MORNING \nThree evacuation workers ram the door of Little Jo's house. \nLittle Jo greets the intruders brandishing a cutting knife and civil war era pistol. \nLITTLE JO You gonna have to shoot me cause I'm not going. \nEVACUATOR 2 Ma'am we're not gonna shoot you. \nLITTLE JO I ain't never left here and I won't never will. \nShe spits. They get closer. \nLITTLE JO (CONT'D) Son, don't make me cancel your birth certificate. \nThe Muscle grabs her by the weapons and in the struggle, slam her to the ground. It's horrible. \nEVACUATOR 2 Relax, relax ma'am. \nLITTLE JO YOU SON OF A BITCH! \nThey drag Little Jo out of the house. \nINT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - MORNING \nMATCH CUT to Wink and Hushpuppy pinned and being dragged out. \nBABYSITTER Hushpuppy needs a hug. \nHUSHPUPPY I don't want your hug! \nThe Babysitter squeezes Hushpuppy. Hushpuppy tries to squirm away. \nBABYSITTER Hushpuppy, that's not how nice girls act. Say \"I'm sorry ma'am.\" Hey! Say it. Say it or you're going to corner time. \nHushpuppy's eyes meet Wink's and she freezes at his horrifying appearance. \nWink grabs a sofa trying to stop the wheelchair as it rolls by. His fingers slips off, too weak to hold on. He tries to scream and nothing but a SEDATED MOAN comes out of his mouth. He tries to pull the tubes out of his arm. \nORDERLY (gently moving Wink's hand AWAY) There there, sir. \nHushpuppy stares in shock as Wink is wheeled away. \nINT. REFUGEE CAMP - WINK'S ROOM - NIGHT \nHushpuppy watches in hiding as a hand covered in a rubber glove changes the bandage on a surgical scar; it looks infected and mishandled. \nThe same hand puts pills in Wink's mouth. \nINT. REFUGEE CAMP - TERMINAL WARD - DAY \nHushpuppy stands over an old man on an artificial respirator. She's creeps closer, examining him. She puts her head on his chest. His heart is beating. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When an animal gets sick here, they plug it into the wall. \nShe whispers in his ear. \nHUSHPUPPY They're coming for you. \nINT. REFUGEE CAMP - TERMINAL WARD - A DIFFERENT BED - DAY \nShe repeats the process with another vegetable. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy says, if he ever got so old he couldn't drink beer, or catch catfish, that I had to put him in a boat, and set him on fire, so no one could come plug him into the wall. \nINT. REFUGEE CAMP - WINK'S ROOM - NIGHT \nHushpuppy peeks through the curtains at another terminal bed. \nShe sees two orderlies force pills into Wink's mouth. He's regaining his strength and is able to hold them off momentarily before submitting, and going limp. \nHushpuppy bolts, unable to take it. \nWe stay in the room as the orderlies walk away. \nWink peeks to make sure they're gone, then spits his pills on the floor. \nWink stares at the ceiling for a long beat. Then, with a burst of energy he grabs his morphine drip and topples himself onto the floor. He pulls his wires out. \nINT. REFUGEE CAMP - KID'S ROOM - MORNING \nHushpuppy lies asleep in a pile with Tee-Lou, Lizard, and Joy. Wink enters and jostles her awake. \nWINK Boss. Let's go. \nWINK No. Hushpuppy... I can't take care of you no more. \nHUSHPUPPY Yes you can. \nHushpuppy stares him down, accusing. \nWINK Daddy's dying! \nHushpuppy's chest heaves up and down. \nWINK (CONT'D) My blood is eating itself. You know what that means? \nHUSHPUPPY Don't be sayin' about dying. \nWINK Everybody's Daddy dies. \nHUSHPUPPY Not my Daddy. \nWINK Yes, your Daddy! \nHer defiance is broken and the information starts to sink in. It hurts Wink as much as it hurts her. \nWINK (CONT'D) I didn't want you to watch that, ok? You understand? \nWink doubles over hacking. He COUGHS horribly. \nHushpuppy looks down and sees blood spotting the grass, dripping from his mouth. \nThe Bathtub gangs charges out the door! \nAcross the parking lot they go in a spree of euphoria, coming to a halt around Wink. \nHushpuppy is trying to drag his limp body across the parking lot. \nHUSHPUPPY Come on! Come on! \nLittle Jo hold Hushpuppy away from him. \nWINK Walrus, get me home. \nEXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY \nThe Bathtub crew carries Wink through the entrance to town. His arms slug over Walrus and Jean Battiste, he's barely able to help walk. \nWe sense from the weary faces and silent eyes that it's been a long journey home. \nINT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY \nThey drag Wink through the Shacko entrance. \nEveryone goes in except Hushpuppy who stops outside the door as they lay him down in convulsions. She stays and tries to watch. \nWink tries to say something to Walrus and can't. Blood bubbles out of his mouth. Wink catches Hushpuppy's eye then looks away as fast as he can. \nReeling, but steady, Hushpuppy backs out the door. \nEXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY \nSERGEANT MAJOR Don't matter baby, this boat'll take you exactly where you need to be. It's just that type of boat. \nHushpuppy and Sergeant Major share an ease unlike anyone else we've seen Hushpuppy interacted with. The speak like an old teacher with his favorite disciple. They let their silences last. \nSERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D) You want a chicken biscuit? \nHushpuppy shakes her head `no'. \nSERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D) They're good for you. \nA deep, far away melancholy settles over him. He munches on a chicken biscuit, then tosses the wrapper on the floor. The wheelhouse is wall to wall with chicken biscuit wrappers. \nSERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D) I been eating these all my life. I keep the wrappers in the boat, `cause they remind me who I was when I ate each one. The smell make me feel cohesive. \nHUSHPUPPY I wanna be cohesive. \nSERGEANT MAJOR Oh you will be, I got no doubt in my mind. \nThey let this thought settle, then Hushpuppy turns her swivel chair back toward the water \nThe beacon appears through the mist. Hushpuppy's eyes go wide. \nAs they approach, another boat comes into view. A half- sunken barge that looks as though its been rusting in the same position for a century. As we move in we see a lit up sign: \"Elysian Fields Floating Catfish Shack GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS.\" \nEXT./INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - ENTRANCE - EVENING \nHushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard disembark onto the barge with Sergeant Major following behind. They circle around a hatch in the floor with light pulsing out of it. Far-away JAZZ echoes up from the bowels of the ship. They look to each other in wonder. \nINT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT \nHushpuppy descends a ladder into a glimmering wonderland. Christmas lights swallow the ceiling, and a light smoke facade encompasses everything. We feel like we're looking at a portal into the past, a Belloq-esque turned New Orleans Jazz parlor. The regulars are all oil-workers wooing their ladies of the night. \nThere is a stage with a DJ and two singers, karaokeing along with \"Until the Real Thing Comes Along\" by Fats Waller. \nThe hyperactive MISS FRANKIE, the matriarch of this establishment, comes a'hoppin'. \nMISS FRANKIE Holy crap you have toddlers! \nSERGEANT MAJOR Good afternoon, Miss Frankie. \nMISS FRANKIE Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit! How you, Sergeant Major? You need some grits? \nSERGEANT MAJOR Yes ma'am. \nMISS FRANKIE Holy Sugar, they are so precious! Y'all just as cute as a tub of puppies! \nWomen descend on the kids who recoil, not knowing what to do with all this affection. Joy Strong puts up her fists. \nHushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry of doting ladies. They are not who she is looking for. They are not who she is looking for. \nShe scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up all over the ceiling, each of them with a bra hung on it, none of them right. \nBar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes, ladies smile and return to their drinks, drunk flirtatious dancers giggle at her, but she remains unfazed. \nShe reaches two swinging doors that lead to the kitchen. \nHushpuppy stops. Sniffs. Heaven. \nCOOK (CONT'D) (encouraging a smile) Awwwwwwwww. \nA real smile emerges across Hushpuppy's face. \nCOOK (CONT'D) Mmm-hmm. \nINT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT \nMagic soars as the couples rock back and forth on the dance floor. Strippers cradle their dates. It's all very sweet and tender. This seems to be the M.O of this strip club, slow-dance not pole-dance. \nThe kids are each dancing with a stripper, glowing with love. They are orphans in a heaven of mothers. \nWe float back to Hushpuppy, the camera dances with her and the Cook. \nThe Cook squeezes Hushpuppy and spins her. Each time we catch their face their eyes are wetter and wetter. \nHUSHPUPPY You can take care of me. Me and Daddy. \nAfter a long beat. \nThe Cook shakes her head `no.' \nCOOK I don't know nothing bout your Daddy, I can't take care of nobody but myself. \nThis sinks into Hushpuppy. \nCOOK (CONT'D) You can stay if you want. \nHushpuppy considers this for a moment, squeezes the Cook. \nHUSHPUPPY This is my favorite thing. \nCOOK I know. \nA far-away look has come over her. Her mind is somewhere else. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) I can count all the time I've been lifted. \nINT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY \nWe look up at a face that's slowly coming into focus- it's Wink, younger and healthier. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) I can count all the times I've been lifted on two fingers. \nHe is the first sight of the slimy newborn baby girl tucked in his arm. Baby Hushpuppy stares up at him as he carries her. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S) Wink! Bring my baby here! They need to wash her off. \nWINK Naw, that waits. \nBaby Hushpuppy's huge-eyed, warped facial expression ogles Wink. She coos. \nWINK (CONT'D) (TO HUSHPUPPY) Alright fatso, breathe some air. \nThey pass through a doorway and sun washes over Baby Hushpuppy. She smiles and smiles at the world. \nINT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCEFLOOR - NIGHT \nThe Aurochs ROARS. Then, inches away from Hushpuppy, she stops. She SNORTS, blowing Hushpuppy's hair back. Hushpuppy doesn't flinch. \nThe Aurochs stares face to face with Hushpuppy. Sniffs. \nEXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY \nWink is frozen in wonder, unable to believe his eyes. \nEXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY \nHushpuppy raises her chin in confident defiance. \nNow in full profile, we see the Aurochs towering 15-feet tall, she takes a step forwards, sniffs again. A low SNORT, or is it a purr? \nThe Aurochs lowers her head with respect. \nHer eyes well with emotion, recognizing one of her own. A ferocious warrior. \nThe Aurochs steps back, takes a knee, and with a BELLY FLOP that rattles the very earth, she lays down. Her three companions follow suit, their fat tummies settling into an almost joyful, lazy, repass. \nA strange calm has settled over Hushpuppy. Almost a smile, but more of a peace and an affection for her equal. They're both children in their way. \nHUSHPUPPY You're my friend, kind of. \nMother Aurochs grunts, a sentence only Hushpuppy can understand. \nHUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) I gotta take care of mine. \nWith weary and clumsy steps, the Aurochs stand and retreat. \nEXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY \nHushpuppy approaches the shacko. It's like walking the plank, but she's unafraid, at one with her destiny. \nThe Bathtub crew look on her in awe. They part ways to let her pass. \nShe reaches the door, steeling her reserve. \nHushpuppy opens the door. \nINT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY \nWink is curled up on Hushpuppy's bed-- very, very thin. His eyes are closed. His chest heaves up and down in short violent breaths. Hushpuppy stands and stares. \nWink looks at Hushpuppy in reverence. He knows it's the last time. \nWink motions for her to come closer. \nHushpuppy inches toward him. It takes all of her might. She sits on his bed. \nHushpuppy takes her to-go container from Elysian Fields out of a paper bag and pops it. She unwraps a gator nugget, dips it in hot sauce, and holds it out for Wink to take a bite. \nHushpuppy watches as Wink chews weakly. She eats one herself. \nWink and Hushpuppy draw it out. They don't want it to end. It takes a full minute for him to swallow the first bite, and she paces herself to finish when he does. \nWINK (BARELY AUDIBLE) Real good. \n", "test1_input": "BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD \nWritten by \nLucy Alibar & Benh Zeitlin \nFINAL DRAFT \nBased on the stage play \"Juicy and Delicious\" by Lucy Alibar EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAWN \nAn abandoned looking trailer sits on top of two 15-foot-tall oil drums. Distant thunder trembles through the peeling metal panels. The structure is in such disrepair, that surely no one lives here. \nBut then, a light goes on. \nINT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - MORNING \nA tiny hand sculpts the mud on top of a crawfish hole placed on the floor. We pan up to reveal a little girl examining a baby chicken that appears to be dead. This is HUSHPUPPY, an unkempt and seemingly uncared for six-year-old with a gaze of unmistakable wisdom. \nHushpuppy places the chick on the crawfish hole, like a queen on her throne and the chick twitches to life, cheeps twice. Hushpuppy's esoteric science experiment is interrupted by DISTANT THUNDER. Her eyes stand to attention. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY \nAn eerie, harsh wind whips hay and dust through over a giant slumbering pot-belly pig. \nHushpuppy, donned in boys' underpants and a child-sized wife- beater, tip-toes behind the epic creature. She studies it, wonderful, is this the source of the thunder? \nWith the utmost delicacy, she lays a hand on the pig's belly. We hear his HUGE BEATING HEART. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - VARIOUS \nA series of glimpses of Hushpuppy's scientific method. She chases geese, chickens, ducks, dogs around the property- a cross between an abandoned farm and salvage yard. \nHushpuppy grabs a baby chick and puts it to her ear. A TINY HEARTBEAT. She listens with focused wonder and intensity. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) All the time, everywhere, everything's organs be beatin' and squirtin' and talkin' to each other in ways I can't understand. Mosta the time they probably just sayin' \"I'm hungry,\" or \"I gotta poop,\" but sometimes they talkin' in codes. \nHushpuppy's eyes dart up as a MAN'S VOICE yells- \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Get up, get out of here! \nWe hear a YOWL as a cat is flung across the room. \nA window made from a gas station sign opens in a Robinson Crusoe style tree house patched together from storm debris and discarded appliances. \nA wild man with severe features, a frazz of unkempt hair, and brawler's scars opens a window made from a metal sign. This is WINDELL EMMETT DOUCET, known to all as WINK (39). \nWINK Get your pants on, man! \nWink kills a beer and sends it out the hole in the wall into a basketball hoop attached to a fishing net that stretched 15 feet down to the ground. The net is overflowing with beer cans. \nEXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY \nHushpuppy obediently climbs a series of increasingly bigger and bigger oil drums that function like a ladder, up to the door of her house. \n", "test1_true": "We now see Wink in his morning ritual. He opens a cooler with a butchered chicken inside it and tosses the bird on the grill. \nHe goes to the front porch and pours down a bag of dog food. \nHe pulls a clothesline that leads to Hushpuppy's trailer. A BELL RINGS. \nWINK Feed up time! Feed up! \nHushpuppy, now wearing pants and a slightly more proper T- shirt, comes running down the oil barrels to her house. She echoes her Daddy. \nHUSHPUPPY Feed up time! Feed up! \nINT. ABANDONED BUS - DAY \nHushpuppy devours the whole roast chicken with her hands, getting right in there like it was a candy apple. It looks really yummy. \nPigs, dogs, chickens, and cats are chowing down all around her. \nA hatch opens above her and we realize we're in the bottom of the Shacko. Wink sticks his head through the hatch and throws corn to the chickens. \nWINK Share with the dogs. \nHushpuppy rips off a piece of chicken and flings it to a filthy chihuahua with no hair on the back half of its body. This is WINDELL, in spite of her circumstances, quite a handsome young pup. \nEXT. BATHTUB MARSH WATER - THE TURCK - EVENING \nWIDE, we see Hushpuppy and Wink drift through the marsh. They ride in a severed truck bed floating on top of oil drums. A motor is strapped to the back. A sign on the boat reads \"The Turck\", Hushpuppy's spelling of \"Truck\". \nThey look out to where the water goes all the way to a monolithic, 20 foot wall stretching infinitely into the distance. This levee, the first piece of modern construction we've seen, encloses the civilized world, protecting it from rising water. The Bathtub is on the wrong side of wall. \nWink stares out at the distant factories behind the wall with a peaceful and confident disdain. \nHushuppy matches his relaxed defiant expression. \nWINK Ain't that ugly over there? \nHe takes a long pull on his beer. \nWINK (CONT'D) We live in the prettiest place on earth. \nHushpuppy looks over the wall to the Dry Side. It's an endless sprawl of oil processing power plants without a tree or bird in sight. This is the engine that runs the Northern world. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy says, up above the levee, on the dry side, they're afraid of the water like a bunch of babies. They built the wall that cuts us off. \nEXT. AERIAL BATHTUB - DAY \nWe fly over marsh and water, coming upon a tiny crop of shanties on an island perched at the very bottom of the land. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They think we all gonna drown down here. But we ain't goin' nowhere. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

TRAIL BEHIND WINK'S COMPOUND - DAY \nThey run deeper into the swamp. \nHUSHPUPPY I'm tearing off! \nWINK You ain't tearing off nothin', I'll bust your ass! \nHUSHPUPPY I'm tearing off just like my Momma. \nWINK Come on! \nWink tried to yank her toward home and Hushpuppy refuses. She digs her heels in. \nWINK (CONT'D) See what happens. See what happens to you! \nHushpuppy hooks her leg around a tree and holds on. \nWink slaps Hushpuppy and she falls face down. \nHe looks away, disgusted with himself. \nWINK (CONT'D) See what you making me do? You're killing me! \nHe reaches down and tries to pick her up. \nWINK (CONT'D) Get up and now come on. \nHushpuppy jumps up on her own. \nHUSHPUPPY I hope you do die! And after you die, I come to your grave and eat birthday cake all by myself! \nHushpuppy punches Wink in the heart and suddenly EVERYTHING GOES QUIET, as if all the insects in the forest have hushed. \nAll at once, we hear-- \nA HUMAN HEART, beating until there is a SONIC BOOM, an earsplitting CRACK of glacial ice. \nHushpuppy turns toward the sound. When she turns back Wink's face has transformed, wrenches with fear and pain. \nWink keels over clutching his arm. \nHushpuppy stares, her breath accelerating. \nWink's eyes roll back in his head, he begins to seizure. \nANOTHER GLACIAL CRACK rings out. The SPLITTING builds to a DEAFENING ROAR. She covers her ears. \nEXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF / WOODS - DAY \nFissures appear like lightning through the massive ice cliff from the opening of the movie. \nHushpuppy runs from the sound, hands over her ears. We INTERCUT with shots of falling glaciers. The universe is coming unravelled. \nAn ice shelf COLLAPSES into the ocean in a MASSIVE AVALANCHE, a wave rolls toward camera. \nEXT. GRAVEYARD BY THE WATER - DAY \n", "test2_true": "Hushpuppy calls out to a distant beacon flashing on the horizon. \nHUSHPUPPY Momma!? Momma!? MOMMA!? I think I broke something. \nEXT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY \nHushpuppy runs out of the woods toward school in a total panic. \nIn front of the school parents pile their children into a pickup trucks and vans. \nHUSHPUPPY Miss Bathsheba! Miss Bathsheba! My Daddy fell down! \nMiss Bathsheba takes Hushpuppy's hands as she tries to catch her breath to speak. Clutched in her hand is the hospital bracelet that Wink had been wearing. \nBathsheba turns over the diagnostic bracelet and reads it, her eyes widen in recognition and alarm. \nINT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY \nHushpuppy watches Miss Bathsheba frantically pull herbs and roots from her containers of medicinal oddities and pack it into a large medicine jar. \nMISS BATHSHEBA It's gonna be OK baby. \nBathsheba hands Hushpuppy the medicine jar. \nMISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Ok, Hushpuppy, here's what I need you to do. You take this medicine and run as fast as you can. Go! \nEXT. SWAMP CLEARING - DAY \nWe see glimpses of nature protecting itself from the impending disaster. Flowers curl up, insects horde food underground, RUSTLING sounds fill the air. Black birds, and bats, and all manner of flying creatures fill the sky. They're all getting the hell out of dodge. \nHushpuppy, quaking with fear, runs through a menacing swamp clutching her medicine jar. The rising winds swirl the marsh grass all around her. \nHushpuppy runs to the spot where Wink collapsed. \nHe's gone. \nHushpuppy looks around the swamp, unable to understand. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy could have turned into a tree, or a bug. There wasn't any way to know. \nHushpuppy hides her medicine jar in her storage unit- a leather flap laid over the hollow of an oak tree. The hollow is filled with trinkets and objects she's collected over the years. \nHushpuppy flinches as a shrieking animal calls out. \nShe looks up to see a leaf covered in writhing caterpillars. One of them has been skewered by a beetle and is fighting for it's life. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The whole universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If one piece busts, even the smallest piece, the entire universe will get busted. \nEXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF - DAY \nBlocks of glaciers roll out of the avalanche and away from Antarctica like floating ice cubes. Embedded in each cube, is an Aurochs. \nA single ice cube takes over the frame and the mammoth dead Aurochs' eye stares right at us. Its jaw wide, its fangs bared, the ferocious beast appears to have fossilized mid- pounce. THUNDER BOOMS. \nWe drift upwards into the cloud cover. As we rise above the white canopy, the spiral of a hurricane forms. \n", "test2_id": 2380, "test3_input": "Wink, Jean Battiste, and Peter T keep their heads above water as they float under the tarp behind the truck bed. Peter T is wearing a life jacket and still has his top hat on. \nWINK (WHISPERING) Peter T, don't hold onto me, hold onto the boat. You gonna be fine. \nJean Battiste duct tapes fireworks around the bomb: a propane tank with an igniter made from a battery and a pouch of black powder. \nHe inserts the bomb into the stomach cavity of a giant garfish carcass. \nWink shoves two propane tanks inside the belly of the garfish. \nHe hands a rope attached to the igniter to Peter T. \nWINK (CONT'D) Peter T, you hold the trip-line. \nPETER T (Soft and sweet) Ok then. \nWINK Just don't pull `til I say. \nPETER T Ok then. \nWINK You can do it. I have complete faith in you. \nPETER T Ok. \nJean Battiste is hesitant. \nWink gives Jean Battiste a confident nod. \nJEAN BATTISTE Lock and load. \nJean Battiste carefully unravels the string that leads to the fuse. He shoves the igniter down the mouth of the garfish. \nEXT. LEVEE WALL, IN THE WATER - DAY \nThe Turck pulls into an enclosed segment of the levee, Wink bobs out from under the Turck and latches a pre-made tether running out of the garfish to a handle on the wall. He bobs back under the boat. \nEXT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY \nHushpuppy dives under the fishing net on a motor boat just before Miss Bathsheba charges outside and keys the ignition. \nHushpuppy peeks out and the boat roars to life and rips across the water. \nHUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The entire universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If you can fix the broken piece, it can all go right back. \nINT. UNDER THE TURCK TARP/SANTA MARIA - DAY \nWINK Peter T hand me the- \nHe looks, Peter T has both hands on the Turck. \nWINK (CONT'D) Peter you didn't drop the trip- line? \nPETER T No I did not. \nPeter T thinks a moment. \nPETER T (CONT'D) Oh, yes I did. \n", "test3_true": "PETER T I'm sorry. \nWink dunks under water. \nEXT. LEVEE - DAY \nWink surfaces in front of the igniter rope. \nAs he grabs the rope, Bathsheba's snake catcher snares his hand and pulls his arm against the side of her Jon boat. \nMISS BATHSHEBA Here's how we do with wild animals. \nWINK AHH! Get off me woman! I'm trying to save the Bathtub \nHushpuppy watches the struggle in hiding. \nBathsheba wrenches the rope out of Wink's hand and chucks it. \nThe igniter rope lands in front of Hushpuppy under the net pile. She grabs it. She reels it in. \nMISS BATHSHEBA Get in the Boat! I'm hauling you're ass back home, little boy. \nJean Battiste swims out of hiding. \nJEAN BATTISTE Wink!? \nWINK Jean Battiste, get the trip line! \nSuddenly, Hushpuppy pops out from under the nets, holding the rope taught. She stumbles and almost sets if off by accident. \nMISS BATHSHEBA Hushpuppy!? \nJEAN BATTISTE She got it! Pull! Pull! \nWINK NOW BOSS! \nMISS BATHSHEBA No! Hushpuppy! \nHushpuppy, contemplates in an eerie peace. \nThe screaming chorus FADES and she is alone in her quiet, eyes darting between Bathsheba and Wink. Courage and certainly clench inside her her. You listen to your Daddy. She pulls the rope. \nEXT. LEVEE WALL IN THE WATER - DAY \nThe trip-line releases the detonator. \nEXT. LEVEE - NORTH SIDE - DAY \nThe levee DETONATES. Shattered wood and cement fire towards camera. \nDebris propels Hushpuppy backwards. \nHer quiet resumes as she lands on the deck of the boat in slow motion.

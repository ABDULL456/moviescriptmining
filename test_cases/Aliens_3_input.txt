RIPLEY (indicating door) Locked. 
HICKS Stand back. 
Hicks snaps the torch off his belt and cuts into the lock.  Inhuman shapes enter the far end of the corridor. Vasquez hands her flamethrower to Gorman and unslings her rifle.  She starts loading 30mm grenades into the launcher, like oversize 12-guage shells. 
GORMAN You can't use those in here! 
VASQUEZ Right.  Fire in the hole! 
She pumps a round up and fires.  The grenade EXPLODES and the blast almost knocks them down.  Hicks kicks the door open, molten droplets flying. 
HICKS (shouting at Vasquez) Thanks a lot!  Now I can't hear shit. 
VASQUEZ (shouting) What? 
INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      156 
Vasquez slides the door almost closed, then fires three grenades rapid-fire through the gap.  She slams the door home as the grenades detonate, the explosion sounding gonglike through the metal. 
Ripley sprints across the room, trying the far door. Burke has locked it as well.  Hicks switches his hand-torch from CUT to WELD and starts sealing the door they just passed through. 
INT. MED LAB                                            157 
Burke, hyperventilating with terror, backs across the dark chamber.  Gasping, almost paralyzed with fear, he crosses the chamber to the door leading to the main concourse.  His fingers reach for the latch.  It moves by itself.  The door opens slowly. 
ON BURKE  his eyes wide, transfixed by his fate.  We hear the BULLWHIP CRACK of a tail-stinger striking as we: 
CUT TO: 
INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      158 
The door dimples with a clanging impact, separating slightly from its frame.  Another crash, the squeal of tortured steel.  Newt grabs Ripley by the hand and tugs her across the room. 
NEWT Come on!  This way. 
She leads Ripley to an air vent set low in the wall and expertly unlatches the grille, swinging it open.  Newt starts inside but Ripley pulls her back. 
RIPLEY Stay behind me. 
Ripley trades her rifle for Gorman's flamethrower before he can protest and enters the air shaft, which is a tight fit.  Newt scrambles in behind, followed by Hicks, Gorman and Vasquez on rearguard.  Glancing back fearfully Newt pushes on Ripley's butt as they crawl rapidly through the shaft. 
NEWT Come on.  Crawl faster. 
RIPLEY DO you know how to get to the landing field from here? 
NEWT Sure.  Go left. 
Ripley turns into a larger MAIN DUCT where there is enough room to crab-walk in a low crouch.  She runs, scraping her back on the ceiling.  The troopers' armor clatters in the confined space.  They approach an intersection.  She fires the flamethrower around the corner, the looks.  Clear. 
NEWT Go right. 
They sprint into the narrow connecting duct, the maze becoming a blur.  Ripley fires the flamethrower periodically, as they pass side ducts covered by louvered grilles or vertical shafts going to higher or lower levels. 
HICKS (into headset) Bishop, you read me?  Come in, over. 
There is a long pause then Bishop's VOICE, almost unintelligible with interference, comes over the radio. 
BISHOP (voice over; static) Yes, I read you.  Not very well... 
EXT. UP-LINK RELAY - LANDING FIELD                      159 
Bishop is huddled against the base of the telemetry mast, out of the wind which is now gusting viciously. 
BISHOP (yelling; over enunciating) The ship is on its way.  ETA about sixteen minutes.  I've got my hands full flying... the weather's come up a bit. 
Bishop's fingers are blurring over the terminal keys and he squints, watching the screen as the flight telemetry updates rapidly. 
In the b.g. the AP station has become a raging demon, wreathed in boiling steam and electrical discharges. 
INT. AIR DUCT                                           160 
HICKS All right, stand by there.  We're on out way.  Over. 
The beam of Ripley's light wavers hypnotically in the tunnel ahead.  She blinks, seeing something...not sure. A GLINTING OBSCENE FORM MOVING TOWARD THEM, filling the tunnel at the absolute limit of the light's power. 
RIPLEY Back.  Go back! 
They try to crawl back, jamming together.  Behind them, the way they have come, a GRATING is battered in with a FEROCIOUS CLANG and the deadly silhouette of a warrior flows into the duct.  They are trapped.  Vasquez uses her flamethrower, bathing the tunnel in fire.  Hicks snaps out his hand-welder and cuts into the wall of the duct.  Molten metal spatters him, as sparks fill the tunnel with lurid light.  Vasquez' flamethrower sputters.

Johnny takes it in his mouth. His tear away shirt is torn away. Johnny stands at the post alone. Corporal Bronski, a big man with an unhappy task, unrolls his whip. 
C.O. You may carry out the sentence. 
BRONSKI One. CRACK !	Johnny's face wrenched by pain, spontanous tears, a terrible sound stifled by the bright red mouthpiece. 
BRONSKI Two. CRACK !	Again. Dizzy flinches for Johnny. 
BRONSKI Three. 
CRACK !	Ace looks away. 
BRONSKI Four. 
CRACK !	Zim watches without any apparent emotion. 
BRONSKI Five. 
CRACK !	Johnny faints, sagging against his tether. 
FADE OUT

cruises past, 600,000 metric tons of star class destroyer, FIGHTERS and LANDING BOATS lining her open hangar deck. 
79	INT	ATHENA - COMMAND AND CONTROL - NIGHT CYCLE - CARMEN 
works alone on the empty bridge. She yawns. Zander brings coffee for himself and Carmen. 
CARMEN Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever. 
ZANDER Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with. 
He caresses her hair. She kisses his hand. Zander notices the plot map. 
ZANDER Profile's wrong... there. 
CARMEN No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way. 
ZANDER Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ? 
CARMEN Hey, check it. 
Zander slides into his chair, runs a check. 
ZANDER You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said... 
CARMEN Don't change the subject. Am I right ? 
ZANDER Well, whad'ya know... 
CARMEN Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ? 
ZANDER She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together. 
CARMEN You and me, huh ? 
Zander turns his chair so they are very close, moves a finger along her hand, up her arm and playfully around her breasts. 
ZANDER I have a feeling about us. We're good together, way ahead of the curve in every department. I seem to be able to anticipate your needs. You know what I want... 
Carmen grabs him between his legs. 
CARMEN No, what do you want ? 
Zander pulls her to him and they kiss passionately. She brteaks it off, gets serious for amoment. 
CARMEN I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet... 
ZANDER Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle. 
They start to caress again when suddenly ALARMS sound. Captain Deladier appears on the hot screen, still waking up. 
DELADIER Report. 
ZANDER Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed... 
Carmen and Zander frantically check their displays. 
CARMEN WHERE IS IT ? 
ZANDER THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG ! 
CARMEN It looks like an... asteroid. 
DELADIER In this part of the system ? 
Carmen and Zander see it through the front screens:		A huge ASTEROID tumbles directly towards them at terrific speed.

LORD PORTLEY-RIND (DESPERATE) Very well. Every boxtroll gone. With proof! 
Snatcher stops halfway down the stairs in the pouring rain, his back still turned to Portley-Rind. 
SNATCHER (LOW PURR) For a white hat? 
CLOSE ON: Snatcher's grinning face as he turns back toward Portley-Rind. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) I will destroy every last boxtroll in this town! 
LIGHTNING CRASHES as Snatcher laughs maniacally.

(0100 MON) MONSTERS 
EXT. CHEESEBRIDGE - WORLD VIEW - SUNSET 
WIDE VIEW OF CHEESEBRIDGE, a steep hill-town that looms over the countryside. A jumble of roofs, a tangle of twisting alleys, and perched at the summit, the imposing Cheese Guild Hall. The last rays of the setting sun disappear. 
EXT. CHEESEBRIDGE STREETS 
--a deep voice echoes out of a scratchy MEGAPHONE. 
SNATCHER (O.S.) Hear ye! Hear ye! Good citizens of Cheesebridge, the curfew is in force. Don't dawdle or the beasts will tear you limb from limb! 
CLOSE ON: A FABRIC BANNER reading "BOXTROLL EXTERMINATORS". 
The banner hangs on a strange rattletrap TRUCK that winds its way up the city streets. Sinister looking men in BLOOD RED TOP HATS hang onto the running boards. The most sinister of them all, Snatcher, rides on the roof. 
SNATCHER (O.S.) (CONT'D) They will add your flesh to their rivers of blood and mountains of bones. 
As the truck passes, PEDESTRIANS gasp and hurry into their houses, heeding the amplified warning. A CHEESEMONGER at The Cheesery pulls his FOLDING SIGN from the sidewalk and hurries inside. A COUPLE stops mid-conversation and heads indoors. A MAN CARRYING A CRATE brings his load into his shop, abandoning the crate sitting at the curb. Two FEMALE TOWNSFOLK head off down the street. 
CLOSE ON: Archibald Snatcher as the truck rounds a corner. He holds a MEGAPHONE TUBE to his mouth and orates as he zeros in on a BOY playing ball in the street. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) Child! Do you want to end up like the Trubshaw Baby? 
The boy watches the truck as it passes, curiosity changing to horror. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) Dragged underground and feasted upon one year ago this very night?! 
The terrified boy shakes his head and GASPS as he is yanked inside by his MOTHER. His BALL bounces out of his hands and rolls across the cobbles. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) Lock your windows! Bolt your doors! Hide anything that is not bolted down. 
One man grabs his DOOR KNOCKER and bolts inside. 
Another man grabs his MAILBOX. 
Another a BARBER POLE. 
With a terrified look the last man peers out of the peep hole in his door, then slams it shut. 
SNATCHER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Hide your cheese. Hide your tender and delicious babies! 
EXT CHEESEBRIDGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 
The wind blows trash down the empty streets. Snatcher's vehicle, rattling from its boiler, prowls past with Snatcher still calling out his warning until the sound fades in the distance. 
SNATCHER (O.S.) Beware the bloodthirsty monsters! They'll fry your eyes, gnaw on your knees, gobble your gizzards... Beware! BEWARE! 
After Snatcher's truck has passed the CAMERA lands on: A MANHOLE. Carved in the heavy iron cover is a warning: "HERE BE MONSTERS". 
A LONG BEAT OF SILENCE. The manhole cover slowly twists and lifts, a pudgy blue hand emerges. Two pairs of yellow, glowing eyes peer out. The creatures talk in expressive but unintelligible GURGLES. Down the street, two more manhole covers lift. 
In pairs and in gangs, these BOXTROLLS -- so called for the cardboard boxes they wear -- emerge from the sewers and scurry through the streets of the besieged town. Their long, forboding SHADOWS creep across walls plastered with posters that read: "CHEESEBRIDGE: A GOUDA PLACE TO LIVE", "REDHATS - BOXTROLL EXTERMINATORS". 
We watch them scurry through streets and alleyways, gurgling quiet directions to each other. They move swiftly and travel in packs. We see a lone boxtroll jump and pull himself in to his box as a DOG BARKS. He pops back out of his box and moves along quickly. 
CLOSE ON: what appears to be a LARGE BOXTROLL MONSTER peering around the corner of a moonlight street. Its glowing eyes turn toward the camera as it sways slowly. Five more pairs of eyes light up within the large, boxy shadow and SIX BOXTROLLS separate from the mass, popping off to run their errands while the coast is clear. 
BIRDS EYE VIEW: Groups of two and three boxtrolls snake their way down streets, skirting carefully around areas lit by street lamps. 
In a small lane, groups of boxtrolls stop to collect mechanical stuff. They work together, using their boxes as tools and props. 
SIX BOXTROLLS stack up in the background to steal a SHOP SIGN, while THREE BOXTROLLS cooperatively steal the WHEEL from a WOODEN CART. 
One boxtroll uses his box to prop up a       corner while the other two release the wheel from the axle. A       LONE BOXTROLL crosses the frame to see what treasures he may       find in a trash bin; as he knocks it over with a CLANG, TWO       BOXTROLLS scurry past and stack together, stealing the HOUSE       NUMBER from the front of a brownstone. 
CLOSE ON: the boxtrolls' booty - the shiny brass number `2', the shop sign for `TIMELESS TIMEPIECES', the wheel that rolls along between two boxtrolls. 
Six other boxtrolls on the hunt stack together against a fence. We watch as one boxtroll makes it over the top, cooperatively pulling the others into the alley behind him.

EXT. CHASE ALLEY - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: The inside of a trash can as the lid is removed. Two BOXTROLL HANDS wriggle into view over the rubbish, fill of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, an APPLE CORE, a BANANA PEEL, and a FISH CARCASS. The boxtroll gurgles "EWW" and "BLECH" sounds as he moves these unwanted items aside. He gurgles with joy when a bit of brass is revealed. 
FISH, a nervous 4-foot tall, wonky-toothed, pointy-eared, gangly-limbed boxtroll, pulls an old broken ALARM CLOCK from the trash barrel. He is in a large alley, filled with old boxes, crates, broken items and tarps strewn about. 
Fish stares curiously at the object, turning it over in his hands and holding it to his ear, listening. He shakes the clock and hears loose gears RATTLE. 
FISH Hmm... 
Fish opens the clock face        and gurgles, intently toying with the mechanical interior.         After a moment, the clock begins to TICK with activity. Fish         gurgles excitedly and closes the clock face, holding it to        his ear to listen to the rhythmic ticking.

EXT. POOL - DAY Franklin is in the water. Roy lifts Fred out of his wheelchair and gently puts him in the shallow end. Franklin receives him. Fred's face is ecstatic as he floats on his back in the water. 
ELEANOR (V.O.) "I hope you are finding your work to be gratifying in both mind and heart. Your beloved, Eleanor." 
EXT. MERIWETHER INN - DAY A very old car comes coughing in, steam hissing from its engine. 
HELENA MAHONEY, 43, gets out of the driver's seat. Her iron will is matched only by her deep reserves of empathy. She gets a good look at the Inn. This is what she has come for? 
EXT. COTTAGE PORCH - DAY Franklin and Roy, having finished lunch, are playing checkers. Fred is sitting nearby eating a piece of pie. 
Helena approaches. Roy pulls off a triple jump. 
FRANKLIN Damn! 
ROY King me. 
Franklin reluctantly tops Roy's checker. 
FRED You're losing, Doc. 
HELENA Doc? I'm sorry, you're Franklin Roosevelt, aren't you? 
FRANKLIN Depends. (suspiciously) Are you a lawyer? 
HELENA No. 
FRANKLIN Then Roosevelt it is. Wait! 
He jumps one of Roy's checkers. 
HELENA I'm Helena Mahoney. I'm a physical therapist. (off their blank looks) You have no idea who I am, do you? 
FRANKLIN Should I? 
HELENA I wrote you a letter right after I saw the article in the paper. Didn't you read it? 
FRANKLIN It got read, I assure you. But probably not by me. 
Helena glances down at the checkerboard and points to it. 
HELENA (to Roy) He's open right there. 
ROY He sure is. 
Roy trounces Franklin with three swift moves. 
ROY Thank you, ma'am. 
Helena sits at the table with them. 
HELENA I've been studying the effects of moist heat on polio patients and I think with repeated exercise in warm water... 
FRANKLIN It can help them regain lost strength. 
HELENA Yes. 
FRANKLIN Incredibly I've come to the same conclusion myself. 
HELENA (a half-smile) Well, you're the doctor. 
EXT. MERIWETHER INN - DAY 
Helena is wheeling Franklin around the grounds. 
HELENA No ramps, no running water, no doctors... from the article in the newspaper I assumed this was a rehabilitation center. F RANKLIN Don't believe everything you read. 
HELENA I feel like I was brought here under false pretenses. 
FRANKLIN Join the club. 
INT. A BARN - DAY Franklin lies across a makeshift examining table. Helena's examination is in progress. 
She is completely absorbed -- all business -- pouring over his muscles inch by inch. She kneads, bends and stretches them with a laser-like focus, finally picking up Franklin's leg and rotating it out and around. 
HELENA Push against my hand.

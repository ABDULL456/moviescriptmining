CARTER Let's get him into recovery. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER 
The chamber is half constructed out of Plexiglas at the end of the Hallway of Habitats. 
On the recovery bed, a sheet drapes over Sebastian's invisible body. The gentle bleatings of medical machinery pound out a dulling rhythm. 
Linda sleeps in a corner chair as Matt slips into the room. He checks the readouts on Sebastian then takes a seat by Linda. She wakes with a start. 
MATT S'okay. You nodded off. 
LINDA His breathing's hypnotic. How long's it been? 
MATT Seventeen hours. 
LINDA Where are the others? 
MATT In the lab crunching numbers. We've got enough data there for two lifetimes of research. 
Linda rubs her temples and gestures to the bed. 
LINDA I keep looking at that hole, wondering if he's really there. 
She notices something out of the corner of his eye. The sheet twitches. 
LINDA (cont'd) Did you see... 
The sheet twitches again. 
MATT He may be coming out of it. 
Linda and Matt watch intently. Then suddenly... the sheets thrash violently. A yell of pain. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE The lights! Turn off the goddamn lights! Ah Christ! 
Linda jumps up and crosses to Sebastian. Matt rushes to the wall and turns off the lights. Darkness. The room is lit by the glow of machinery. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) I can't... I can't close my eyes. I can't close my eyes. 
LINDA Your eyelids are transparent. 
The sheets slowly stop thrashing. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE So I ... I'm... 
LINDA Yes. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE My arms. I can.. where? ... I can feel them... 
LINDA Your arms ... your whole body... It worked, Sebastian. It worked. 
The sheet rises and slips away. The wires, seemingly connected to thin air, spread out like a spider's web and then fall away one-by-one. The monitors all go dead. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE Mirror. I ... I want to see. 
MATT Over here in the corner. 
Matt motions to a dark corner of the room, toward a mirror and sink. We push in on the mirror. No reflection. Suddenly it fogs up ... Sebastian's breath. A finger tracing appears in the fog ... but of course we see no finger. The sink faucet twists on and water runs. It cups into the shape of hands and lifts into the air, splashing against the surface of Sebastian's face. Beads of water cling to his f ace, outlining it I shape f or a moment before dripping away. 
MATT (cont'd) What was it like? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE I ... It's hard to think. 
Sebastian's voice is now behind him. Matt turns around. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) The transformation... I remember every molecule in my body shattering. 
MATT It was painful? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE At first... but then everything went black. I couldn't see or hear or feel anything. It was all just black... like I wasn't connected. 
LINDA Your system received quite a shock. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE At least my senses are starting to return... You're wearing your Shalimar, aren't you? 
Linda realizes that he's standing very close by. Her hair lifts slightly and Sebastian inhales. Chills go down her spine. 
LINDA Sebastian. 
Linda's hair drops back to her shoulders. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE This is weird. I'm looking through myself at the floor. I'm looking right through myself. I can't tell ...

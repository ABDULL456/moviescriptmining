PEGGY (sotto) This is never going to work. 
The old men form a circle in front of Peggy. They begin to circumambulate east to west, intoning together, their heads bowed. As Barney passes in front of Peggy, he winks at her. She smiles back. 
MEN Fount of life, Chariot of the Spirit, Womb of the Mother, reclaim thy child of light. 
We HEAR a clap of distant THUNDER. Peggy trembles. The artificial bird falls off the plant. Peggy is struck with amazement. She begins to glow, poised to take off. The men continue to chant while: 
LEO (O.S.) The name of your love is sacrifice. We offer up this girl, that her soul may find its home. 
Suddenly a door is opened, a gust of wind pours in and extinguishes the candles, plunging the hall into darkness. 
LEO (0.S.) Nothing to worry about. Somebody get the lights. 
The LIGHTS are TURNED ON. All the men look to the throne. 
Peggy is gone. They are speechless for a couple of beats. 
GEORGE (chipper) Well, the girl's gone. Let's play some poker. 
CLOSE ON BARNEY  He smiles, happy that she made it. George crosses to the wall, reaches behind the drapes and presses a button. The wall slides open to reveal a fullyequipped card room. The men shuffle in. 
EXT. BEHIND THE LODGE 
Charlie carries Peggy off towards his car, one hand covering her mouth. Peggy struggles. When they reach the car, he puts her down. She's still wrapped in her golden robe. 
PEGGY What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here? 
CHARLIE I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you. 
PEGGY Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there. 
CHARLIE You're going to listen to me. 
Charlie tries to Lead Peggy into the car. 
PEGGY I'm not getting in that blue monstrosity. 
Charlie pushes her inside, Peggy climbs back out. Charlie takes her hand and drags her up a hill behind the lodge hall. 
PEGGY Let me got! Where are you taking me? 
CHARLIE Right here. Now sit down. 
Charlie sits her down on the ground. She's impatient and hopping mad. 
CHARLIE Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore. 
PEGGY How could you possibly know what I've been going through? 
Thunder and lightning. It starts to rain. 
CHARLIE Because I love you, damnit! I had a long talk with your father yesterday and we decided that the best thing for us to do is get married and settle down. Right away. 
Peggy jumps up, exploding to Charlie. 
PEGGY What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice. 
CHARLIE What? 
PEGGY You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless. 
CHARLIE You're crazy! You're really out of your mind! 
PEGGY I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie. (tears start) I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that. 
Charlie bends down to comfort her, in tears. He hugs Peggy and strokes her hair. 
CHARLIE Oh, Peggy. My poor Peggy. It's all my fault. I'm so sorry. I won't bother you anymore. I promise. Please stop crying. Please. 
Peggy starts to compose herself. 
PEGGY Will you take me back to my grandparents? 
CHARLIE Of course. 
Charlie helps her up. Be reaches into his pocket and takes out a small box, handing it to Peggy. 
CHARLIE It's almost your birthday. I wasn't sure when you were coming back, so I brought your present up here. 
With a slow, growing remembrance, Peggy opens the box. Inside is the gold locket Peggy was wearing at the reunion. 
PEGGY (anguished) Oh, Charlie.

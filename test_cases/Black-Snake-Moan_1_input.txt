RONNIE You feelin' sick? 
RAE I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get. 
RONNIE Yeah, I know. 
Ronnie tries to look away, trying to make an awkward moment less awkward. Rae's anxiety is hitting her. 
RAE I think it'd be better if you talk to me. 
RONNIE Yeah? 
RAE Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'. 
Ronnie nervously considers this before agreeing to open his mouth. He points into the tub. 
RONNIE Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick. 
RAE Are you wasted? 
RONNIE No. I just got a messed up stomach. 
RAE (remembering) Holy shit! 
RONNIE What? 
RAE Holy shit, Ronnie! (smacks him on the arm) You're a fuckin' rock star. 
RONNIE I'm a what? 
RAE All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal... 
Ronnie leans over and dry heaves into the tub. It is painful. Rae leans forward and touches his back, comforting him. 
RAE Hey? You okay, Ronnie? 
Ronnie falls back, gripping his stomach, there are tears in his eyes from the dry heaving. Suddenly emotion hits him. 
RONNIE (through tears and clenched teeth) Box of cereal... well, Goddamn... (looks at his trembling fists) Everybody keeps sayin' things to me take make me feel great. But I don't feel great at all. I feel like I'm comin' outta my skin. Like I'm losin' control of my mind. (looks into Rae's eyes) I'm not like this. I'm not usually so... afraid. (really starts crying) I don't know what's... wrong... 
Rae pulls Ronnie to her. He cries into her shoulder. She gently rubs his wet face and sings her words of comfort. 
RAE Is'okay... Is'okay... 
Ronnie begins to calm down. The sobbing abates. 
The metal music from the party outside is muffled through the door. The two hold onto each other in silence. 
Rae pees. They both giggle, a welcome release of tension. 
RAE I feel better. Do you? 
RONNIE Yeah, I do. 
EXT. LAZARUS' BARN - NIGHT 
Ronnie lifts his head from sleep - his memory of Rae has vanished. 
He is leaning against the corner of the barn, his .45 in his grip. His gaze slowly turns toward Laz's darkened house. 
His hand begins to shake. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
EXT. LAZARUS' HOME - EARLY MORNING 
A crow squawks in the rows of corn. A bright morning is coming. 
INT. LAZARUS' HOME - THE BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 
Laz is still asleep. The sound of clumsy guitar playing, accompanied by a tiny voice, can be heard. 
RAE (plucking, trying to find the right note) You... are my... sunshine. 
Laz opens his eyes. 
INT. LAZARUS' HOME - EARLY MORNING 
Laz quietly creeps into the doorway to watch Rae struggle with the guitar playing. He could stay there for hours watching this little girl play his guitar. 
Rae looks up and sees Laz. She stops playing. 
RAE Sorry. 
LAZARUS Looks like you know a song.

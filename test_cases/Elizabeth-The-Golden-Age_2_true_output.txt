(looking at Raleigh) When I love, I love for myself. (pause) 
You have had many loves, I think. 
RALEIGH (with a smile) Some... ELIZABETH You've yet to meet your equal? Raleigh hesitates. She understands him. RALEIGH I would want someone who knows me as I am. Now it is Elizabeth who hesitates. He understands her as well. ELIZABETH You want a friend, not just an equal. You want someone to share your joy when you're happy. 
Double Blue - july 8 - p.43B ELIZABETH(cont'd) Someone to cry with when you're sad. Someone to talk to when there's nothing to say. Someone to find by your side when you wake in the night. Someone who remembers what you once were, when you've grown old. She turns to him with a smile. ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Ah yes. I know all about it. There. I'm rested now. She turns her horse around in the direction from which they came. Raleigh follows. ELIZABETH (CONT'D) We can be something to each 
other, I hope, Mr. Raleigh. 
She spurs her horse, and suddenly she's racing away, back across the park to the distant band of mounted courtiers 
and Queen's ladies, including Bess. Raleigh spurs his horse to follow, also fast, but this time careful to keep a distance behind. As they near the courtiers, Raleigh splits off. Bess watches as Elizabeth turns and looks after him as he rides away. 
INT. BESS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Bess creeps out of her bedroom, pulling on a cloak. 
INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - NIGHT Bess makes her way down the dark palace corridor, stepping over sleeping courtiers as she goes. Margaret watches her from the shadows. 
EXT. LONDON ALLEY - NIGHT Cloaked and hooded, Bess passes quietly down an alley, stepping over more sleeping forms. London's homeless. 
She finds a door, checks a note she holds, glances round to be sure no one sees her, knocks and enters. 
INT LONDON HOUSE - NIGHT A man closes the door behind his visitor. Bess shakes off her hood. It's George Throckmorton, one of the conspirators. They embrace. 
Double Blue - july 8 - p.43C 
BESS George! What's wrong? Is your father alright? THROCKMORTON He's old. He won't live long now. Thank you for coming, dear Bess. BESS I was worried. You must send me no more letters. You know what would happen if I was caught. THROCKMORTON I need your help. BESS Do you need more money? THROCKMORTON My father is a tired old man. We don't want to hide like this 
anymore. We both want to get back to court. BESS You are known Papists. 
THROCKMORTON The Queen loves you. Speak to her. BESS I cannot betray the Queen. 
THROCKMORTON You are not betraying her. My 
father and I will embrace the new faith. Bess is suspicious and starts to leave. BESS Don't put me in danger like this. THROCKMORTON Cousin Bess, we've known each other all our lives. I would do nothing to harm you. BESS I'm sorry. THROCKMORTON If they catch us, they will kill us. Our lives are in your hands.

INT. HALLWAY, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY A group of the Queen's ladies make their way down the hallway, Bess among them. The others are gossiping in low whispers as they go. Bess is silent with anxiety. 
Then she looks ahead, and her face fills with fear. Walsingham is coming down the hallway towards them. The ladies curtsey. He nods, and throws a glance at Bess. The ladies move on. 
Bess looks back. Walsingham is also looking back, and seems to be watching her. 
INT. PRIVY CHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY Bess hurries ahead of the others through the Privy Chamber to the Queen's private quarters.

ess passes ladies organising the Queen's wardrobe. She finds the Queen laughing with Raleigh - not alone, but unusually informal. 
LIZABETH Don't tease me, Mr Raleigh. There's nothing I'd like to do more. 
RALEIGH So why don't you? 
ELIZABETH Alright, then. I will. 
He blinks: caught by surprise. 
ELIZABETH See! You lie! You don't want me on your ship at all. (turning towards Bess) You're a liar! Elizabeth now takes in Bess.

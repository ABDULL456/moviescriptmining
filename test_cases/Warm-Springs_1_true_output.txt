LOUIS Your turn. 
Eleanor rises and goes into the cottage as Louis takes her seat next to Helena. 
INT. COTTAGE - CONTINUING ELEANOR Roy, so good to see you. 
ROY Very good to see you, Mrs. Roosevelt. 
She approaches a surprised Franklin. Leaning in, she runs a hand across his stubbly beard. He looks up at her. 
ELEANOR You're a mess. 
FRANKLIN The report. I'll never... 
She sits by his side and Franklin begins to cry. His sobs grow louder connecting to the despair deep inside him. It unleashes an avalanche of grief. 
ELEANOR Oh my darling... 
FRANKLIN I'm useless, Eleanor. I feel so useless. 
ELEANOR That's not true. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. 
Finally, his sobs subside. 
F 
E 
ELEANOR You have done a brilliant thing here -- a magnificent thing. 
Eleanor picks up the E doctor's report and puts it in the fire. 
LEANOR Let's get you in the water. 
EXT. THE POOL - DAY Franklin is wheeled down to the pool by Roy and Eleanor. When they get closer, Franklin makes out someone already swimming. 
ELLIOT Hi, Pop! 
FRANKLIN (squinting) Who's that? 
ELLIOT ROOSEVELT is now 17 years old. He has his mother's enormous blue eyes and his father's natural charisma. 
FRANKLIN Elliot! 
LLIOT Come on! You getting in? 
Louis and Helena approach the pool. 
FRANKLIN I sense a conspiracy. 
LOUIS You ain't seen nothin' yet. 
ranklin smiles, warily. 
EXT. A CLEARING - DAY Elliot is climbing a rope dangling high from a tree as Franklin and Eleanor look up at him. Franklin is standing on crutches. 
Elliot descends with a flourish as Helena approaches Franklin with a single cane. 
HELENA Franklin, let go of your crutches. You're not going to need them. 
FRANKLIN What? 
HELENA We're going to make your arms function as your legs. 
FRANKLIN How is that possible? 
HELENA Elliot, go to your father and stand on his left side. 
ELLIOT Think this may work, Pop. 
HELENA Eleanor, take the crutch. 
Eleanor takes one crutch as Helena takes the other, replacing it in Franklin's hand with a cane. 
Then, with Elliot on Franklin's left side she bends Elliot's arm at a right angle, like a parallel bar, and hooks Franklin's left arm around his.

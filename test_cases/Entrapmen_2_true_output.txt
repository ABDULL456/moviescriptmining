...something peculiar. The right leg has no stripe. Touches the cloth.  Slightly sticky where the stripe should be.  Odd. 
ANGLE...the bathroom.  Shower running full BLAST.  But there's no one in it. 
ANGLE...a storage closet.  Mac crouching in the smallspace.  We see the travel bag.  The luggage tag, VIRGINIA ROMAY, a Darien, Connecticut address.  The embossed initials VR.  But there is something else in Mac's hand... 
...a prescription bottle.  Prilosec.  And a name, GINGER BAKER. Chicago address.  Mac puts the pills in the pocket of his robe... 
...exits the closet.  Locks the door. 
ANGLE...Mac ambling into the bedroom, toweling his hair with one hand.  Holding his billfold in the other.  Gin is starting a room service breakfast.  Eggs, sausage, Belgian waffles.  The girl can eat. 
MAC I'm so glad I didn't leave Tokyo. 
She looks up.  Trademark dry grin... 
GIN I love a guy who knows how to sweet talk. 
He stands over her.  Smiling.  What he meant was... 
MAC There was a call.  While you were sleeping. 
A call. 
MAC An art dealer I know.  He has a Monet.  Minor, but it is Giverny. He'll let me have it for 5.3 million. 
She stares at him. 
GIN (cautiously) We can maybe beat that. 
MAC (pulling plastic from his billfold) I agree.  This is a bank debit card. It gives the bearer access to an account containing 4.6 and change. I dislike round numbers. 
And hand. the card to her.  As her eyes move over it... 
MAC I'd like you to go down there, and pick up the painting.  If that's all right. 
Without looking up... 
GIN Me. 
MAC If I'm there, he'll haggle.  You just hand him the debit card, with that...luminous smile.  And say, take it or leave it. 
Now her eyes come up.  She says nothing.  Hesitant. 
MAC Oh, dear.  I thought you so wanted to make a good impression. 
GIN Thought I already did th... 
MAC And along with making an excellent impression.  You will also make 2 percent of the purchase price. 
She blinks. 
MAC That's $92,000.  And change.. For two hours work. 
The look holds.  He goes to the desk.  Lifts a cellular phone. TOSSES it to her. 
MAC Any problems.  Just give me a ring. 
GIN Stolen painting is it? 
MAC Of course not. 
And on his way out the door... 
MAC If it was.  I wouldn't pay more than three. 
EXT. WHARF, YOKOHAMA - DAY 
Gin climbing out of a taxi at a scruffy section of Yokohama's Bund. Sleazy shops, pachinko parlors, hostess bars, sidewalk noodle counters, all built along a tall rickety PIER nearly thirty feet above the pounding surf.  The harbor is gigantic.  Every type and size of vessel imaginable. 
Gin carries a long neoprene-covered tube with watertight seals and a lightweight bright orange foam cover.  She looks at her slip of paper.  Then across at the place...KENDO SOUVENIRS, a schlock kickback parlor, with a tourist bus parked out front. 
This can't be right.  Pulls out the cellular phone.  Dials. 
MAC'S RECORDED VOICE (O.S.) You have reached the voice-mail of AMD Investments.  And, yes, you are at the right place. 
Fucking great. 
GIN (into phone, pissed) I like men with a sense of humor. This does not qualify. 
SNAPS the phone shut.  Checks the slip again.  Walks firmly across the street, through the mobs of tourists, and into... 
INT. KENDO SOUVENIRS - DAY 
The place is huge, ramshackle, loaded with every piece of tourist crap imaginable.  The only paintings on display are renderings of big cats on black velvet.  She winds her way through, to a counter at the back.  One guy there... 
GIN (subtitled Japanese) May I please speak with Mr. Okati. 
OKATI You doin' it. 
The best we can say for the pudgy, balding fellow in the Hawaiian shirt and spectacularly baggy trousers, is that he does not seem to be the guy who is selling you a Monet.  Even a minor one. 
GIN I think there's some mista... 
OKATI You from Mac? 
She stops.  Jesus.  The guy COUGHS horribly. 
GIN I'm from Mac. 
OKATI Lemme see card.

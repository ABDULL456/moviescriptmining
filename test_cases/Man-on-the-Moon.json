{"train": "Man on the Moon \nMan on the Moon (1999) by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. \nFADE IN: \nINT. VOID - DAY \nStanding in a nonexistent set is ANDY KAUFMAN, looking a bit nervous.  Wide-eyed, tentative, he stares at us with a needy, unsettling cuteness.  His hair is slicked-down, and he wears the \"FRIENDLY WORLD\" costume from the Andy Kaufman special. \nFinally, Andy speaks -- in a peculiar FOREIGN ACCENT. \nANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) Hallo.  I am Andy.  Welcoom to my movie. (beat; he gets upset) I hoped the story of my life would be nice...but it turned out terrible!  It is all LIES!  Tings are mixed up... real people I knew play different people.  WHAT A MESS! So I broke into Universal and cut out the junk.  Now it's much shorter.  In fact, this is the end of the movie.  So tanks for comink! Bye-bye! \nAndy puts a needle on a phonograph, and swelling CLOSING CREDITS MUSIC starts to play.  FINAL CREDITS roll. \nAndy stands frozen, awkwardly looking at the audience. Every time the music ends he picks up the needle and restarts the music.  He does that as many times as the credits require. \nFinally, CREDITS END.  And then--a sly smile.  He leans in. DROPS HIS ACCENT and WHISPERS. \nANDY (AS REGULAR VOICE) Okay!  Just my friends are left.  I wanted to get rid of those other people... they would have laughed in the wrong places. (beat) I was only kidding about the movie... it's actually PRETTY GOOD! It shows everything... from me as a little boy until my death -- (his eyes pop; he covers his mouth) Oops!!  I wasn't supposed to talk about that!  Oh.  Eh, uh, we better just begin.  It starts back in Great Neck, Long Island... \nAndy turns to a primitive 16mm PROJECTOR and turns it on. WHIR!  He smiles at the flickering light. \nANDY Oh, yes.  I remember it well... \nWe PUSH INTO the white light.  It fills our frame, blazing whiter, whiter... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - 1957 - DAY \nA BLACK AND WHITE image slowly becomes COLOR.  Great Neck, 1957.  An upper-class Jewish neighborhood.  In the street, crewcut BOYS play t-ball, laughing and shouting.  A fat convertible pulls up to the smallest house, and STANLEY KAUFMAN, 40, gets out.  Still in his suit, he's a well- meaning slave to his job -- tired, responsible. \nStanley goes over to admire the t-ball game.  At bat is his son MICHAEL, 6, a natural charmer.  Michael swings -- crack! -- and hits a solid single.  Stanley smiles. \nSTANLEY That's my boy!  Good swingin', kiddo. (warm beat; then a look) Hey -- Michael... where's your brother? \nMICHAEL He's inside. \nInstantly -- Stanley's mood turns black.  He frowns angrily, then snatches his briefcase and marches in. \nINT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, KITCHEN - 1957 - DAY \nBaby CAROL is crying.  Mom JANICE, 35, quickly peels carrots, trying to get dinner made.  Stanley marches past. \nSTANLEY Is he in his room? \nJANICE Of course he's in his room. (aggravated) All his \"friends\" are in there. \nStanley glowers.  He huffs upstairs. \nINT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, HALLWAY - 1957 - DAY \nStanley hurries up to Andy's shut door.  We hear little Andy doing VOICES. \nANDY (O.S.) (as WORRIED GIRL) But professor, why are the monsters growing so big? (now as BRITISH PROFESSOR) It's something in the jungle water. I need to crack the secret code. \nStanley rolls his eyes.  He opens the door... \nINT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY \n...revealing ANDY, 8, performing for the wall.  Andy is happy and enthusiastic... as long as he's acting. \nANDY (as BRITISH PROFESSOR) Maybe I should talk to the natives. (as dancing NATIVES) Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba -- \nSTANLEY Andy! \nANDY (startled) Oh! \nThe boy suddenly turns off, becoming introverted... awkward. Frustrated, Stanley stares at his son. \nSTANLEY Andy, this has to stop.  Our house isn't a television station.  There is not a camera in that wall. \nAndy glances over at the wall.  Hmm. \nSTANLEY (cont'd) (trying to cope) Son... listen to me.  It isn't healthy.  You should be outside, playing sports. \nANDY But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five. \nSTANLEY (he blows his top) You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience! \nANDY (he points at the wall) B-but I have them. \nSTANLEY No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?! \nAndy thinks, considering his options.  Then, he nods. CUT TO: \nINT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - 1957 - LATER THAT DAY \nBaby Carol sits in her crib.  Andy's hands suddenly YANK her out. \nINT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY \nAndy hurries in and plops Carol down on the floor.  She dutifully sits there, deadpan. \nAndy returns to the center of the room.  He resumes his show. \nANDY (as KIDDIE SHOW HOST) And now, boys and girls!  It's time for... TV Fun House! (he makes an APPLAUSE SOUND) Hi, everybody!  Are you ready for a singalong?  I'll say the animal, and you make his sound!  Okay...?  Okay! (he starts to SING) \"Oh, the cow goes.........\" \nSECRETARY (O.S.) He says he's an associate of Andy Kaufman's. \nGEORGE Oh. (back to the phone) Sammy, think about it.  I gotta go. (he punches a line) Hello?  George Shapiro here. \nOn the phone, a STACCATO, ABRASIVE NASAL VOICE blares. \nTONY CLIFTON (V.O.) Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO? \nGEORGE (beat) Er, yes.  Speaking. \nTONY CLIFTON (V.O.) \"Speaking\"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking! \nGeorge is baffled. \nGEORGE Can I help you with something? \nTONY CLIFTON (V.O.) Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you! \nGEORGE (stunned) Who is this? TONY CLIFTON (V.O.) You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear. (beat) Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear. \nGEORGE Look... I don't know what your problem is... \nTONY CLIFTON (V.O.) Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU! \nCLICK.  Clifton hangs up.  George is bewildered. \nINT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CLASSROOM - DAY \nThe light is magical.  Soothing SITAR music plays.  Andy and fifteen other BAREFOOT STUDENTS sit on mats in a semi- circle.  Eyes shut, bodies in different yoga positions, they are all meditating. \nFacing them on a throne-like chair sits a reverent, Indian YOGI.  At his feet is the class teacher, LITTLE WENDY, a teeny lady with an absurdly high-pitched voice. \nLITTLE WENDY Now, while continuing your deep breathing, slowly open your eyes. You should feel rested, relaxed, and alert. \nThe students all open their eyes. \nYOGI Do any thoughts come...? \nSTUDENT #1 My mind is clear.  I feel great. \nYOGI Good... \nSTUDENT #2 All the tension is gone from my body. \nThe Yogi's eyes go to Andy.  Andy smiles sweetly. \nANDY I want to thank you, your Holiness. My heart is radiating with pure energy. \nThe Yogi nods kindly. \nYOGI You always had a good heart.  But I'm proud of the progress you've made in your discipline. ANDY Yes.  TM got me focused.  In fact, my manager got me a TV gig!  It's just some new show with no budget, but I'm still excited. \nOh.  The Yogi peers intently. \nYOGI Are you at peace with your family? \nANDY Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here. \nYOGI Goals are important. \nANDY I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life... \nYOGI We are all impressed. \nAndy smiles beatifically.  This means a lot. \nLITTLE WENDY Okay.  Anyone else --? \nANDY Oh, wait!  I have a question. (beat; working up his nerve) Is there... is there a secret to being funny? \nHuh?  The Yogi thinks hard... squinching up his face. Then... he finally speaks. \nYOGI Yes.  Silence. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SNL SET - NIGHT \nAn AUDIENCE sits, waiting for the commercial to end. TECHIES tweak lights.  CAMERAMEN get ready. \nSitting in VIP seats are Andy's FAMILY.  Stanley and Janice are in their late 50's, Michael and Carol in their 20's. They're all anxious. \nCAROL I still can't believe my brother's gonna be on TV...! \nJANICE I hope he doesn't get nervous. STANLEY What's the difference?  This thing's on in the middle of the night -- no one's even gonna see it. \nThe commercial ends, and the \"APPLAUSE\" sign blinks.  The crowd APPLAUDS.  An \"ON THE AIR\" sign lights up. \nHOST Welcome back to Saturday Night Live! And now, as a special treat on our first show... musical guest ANDY KAUFMAN!!! \nThe SNL orchestra starts the intro into a song.  Andy enters the stage with a boom box, and positions himself in front of the microphone.  When the vocals are supposed to start, Andy doesn't open his mouth.  Instead he looks around -- frightened.  The band stops... and starts again.  Andy remains mute.  The Band stops again. \nINT. SNL SET, BOOTH - NIGHT \nThe SNL producer, LORNE MICHAELS, looks worried. \nLORNE MICHAELS What's happening to him? \nINT. SNL SET - NIGHT \nAndy clicks his pen, done.  George smiles and takes the list.  He scans it... then his face gets totally befuddled. \nGEORGE Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS! \nANDY (blas\u0439) Those are my terms. \nGEORGE They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus! (he points at one item) I mean -- \"two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton\"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?! \nANDY He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that. \nGeorge gets a look. \nGEORGE This Clifton called me up.  He's a loon!  He HATES you! ANDY Nah, he just talks tough.  But I owe him one. \nAndy smiles ingenuously, then turns stern. \nANDY (cont'd) If I'm the new Fonz... ABC's just gonna have to give me what I want. (a sarcastic FONZIE IMPRESSION) Heyyyyyy! \nGeorge winces.  He stares at the list. \nINT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY \nGeorge sits across a conference table from three NETWORK SUITS.  He stoically reads the men his demands. \nGEORGE Mr. Kaufman will only appear in half the episodes. (beat) Mr. Kaufman requires an undisturbed 90 minutes of meditation prior to filming. (beat) Mr. Kaufman won't rehearse. (beat) Mr. Kaufman gets his own network Special. \nThe execs are stupefied.  Finally -- George delivers the clincher. \nGEORGE (cont'd) And Taxi must guarantee two guest appearances to... Tony Clifton. \nNETWORK GUYS WHO??? \nGEORGE Tony Clifton. \nNETWORK GUY #1 Who is he?! \nGEORGE (solemn) I don't know. \nLong pause.  The execs stare at George like he's lost his mind. \nGEORGE (cont'd) But Andy says he's fabulous. (awkward) He also says, these are the terms. \nThe execs' leader, MAYNARD SMITH, shudders hopelessly. \nNETWORK GUY #2 Couldn't Kaufman ask for more money, like everyone else? \nGeorge slowly, sadly shakes his head:  No. \nMaynard glances at his team -- then frowns. \nMAYNARD (cont'd) George, we don't book phantom performers.  The deal's off. \nINT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY \nGEORGE throws his attach\u0439 case on the desk, then slumps into his chair.  He picks up the phone and dials. \nGEORGE Andy? \nANDY (O.S.) Hi George! \nGEORGE Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere? \nANDY (O.S.) Of course. (beat) But only on Monday nights. \nGEORGE That's alright.  Where...? \nINT. MAMA ROMA'S - NIGHT \nMama Roma's, a dark Italian restaurant with red booths, wise guys, and cigarette smoke. \nThe Maitre'd guides George to a booth.  A small BAND fills the \"stage\" -- a six-foot space in the back of the room. \nThe lights dim.  A BLARING ANNOUNCER speaks. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) And now, Mama Roma's is proud to present International Singing Sensation... a man who has sold more records than Elvis and the Beatles combined... \nGeorge is skeptical. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd) Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Entertainment... TONY CLIFTON! \nThe DRUMMER starts a drum roll.  Patrons APPLAUD.  A LIGHT SPOT hits the entrance area... and nobody enters.  The spot is waiting... waiting... still waiting... until the drum roll slows down and stops.  The announcer BOOMS again. ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd) Ladies and Gentlemen, out of respect for Mr. Clifton's vocal demands, could everyone please extinguish your cigarettes and cigars. \nThe crowd GRUMBLES angrily -- then irritably complies.  One ANGRY GUY thrusts his cigar into a water glass. \nANGRY GUY Goddamn, I paid five dollars for this. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) And now!  A man who needs no introduction... TONY CLIFTON! \nThe band starts playing lounge standard \"VOLARE\".  And then, obnoxious TONY CLIFTON swaggers out.  Tony has a rubbery face, black wig and moustache, sunglasses, a padded belly, and a peach tuxedo with blue shirt and velvet piping. \nTony stops, smirks at the audience, and sucks on a cigarette.  He blows smoke rings at them. \nTONY CLIFTON Heh-heh.  How ya all doin'? \nThe crowd is furious. \nANGRY GUY Fuck you! \nPeople light back up and start talking.  Tony ignores the ruckus.  He starts SINGING, pinched and off-key. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY \nMaynard and the ABC suits sit at the table, mesmerized. George is confidentially whispering to them. \nGEORGE This has to stay in the room... but here's the thing: Andy is Tony.  And Tony is Andy!  They'll deny it up and down, but I swear to God, they're the same person! (with urgency) It's smart business!  You'll get two Andy Kaufmans for the price of one! \nMaynard thinks about this, quite methodically.  A beat, and then he cracks a smile... \nINT. ALPHA BETA SUPERMARKET - NIGHT \n1 a.m. in the supermarket.  Just a few people linger... including Andy, who's at the Space Invaders videogame.  Andy stares intently at the screen, eyes piercing, fingers hammering the buttons while he blows up Martians.  Andy is oblivious to all around him. \nIn the b.g., George suddenly enters.  He looks around the market, then spots Andy.  He feverishly runs up. GEORGE Andy! \nANDY (still playing the game) What's up? \nGeorge grins crazily, ecstatically. \nGEORGE Andy... THEY SAID YES!  They agreed to it all!  They thought your terms were a shining example of your \"irreverent wit\" -- and precisely why they want you! (beat) You're getting EVERYTHING! \nWhoa.  Andy looks up, astonished.  His space station EXPLODES, but he doesn't notice.  He turns to George... and slowly smiles sweetly.  Genuinely. \nANDY Well thank you very much...! \nCUT TO: \nINT. TAXI SET - DAY \nThe first week of \"TAXI.\"  The CAST rehearses on the Taxi set.  PRODUCERS watch from the bleachers. \n(The actual TAXI scene will be determined.)  JUDD HIRSCH, TONY DANZA, and MARILU HENNER read their lines. \nThen... a bored BLACK STAND-IN reads Latka's line. \nThe cast glances around.  Tony Danza loses his temper. \nTONY DANZA Man, this is bullshit! (he marches up to the PRODUCER) Where's Kaufman?  Why isn't he here?? \nOne producer stands.  This is tightly-wound ED WEINBERGER. \nED You'll see him on Friday when we shoot.  Now run the lines with Rodney. \nAn angry beat.  The actors resume... \nINT. TAXI SET - DAYS LATER \nThe AUDIENCE is filtering in.  They fill the studio bleachers. \nINT. TAXI SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY \nActors mingle outside the dressing rooms. \nJUDD HIRSCH I'm taking bets we do the show with the stand-in. \nMARILU HENNER No, I hear Andy arrived.  Rumor is he's locked inside his dressing room. \nJudd is surprised. \nINT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nAndy is meditating.  He's tranquil, at total inner peace. \nSilence -- until a little clock radio CHIRPS. \nAndy snaps his eyes open.  He exhales a few calm breaths, then sits upright.  Andy reaches for a sealed envelope, rips it open, and removes a SCRIPT. \nAndy sighs, opens the script, and starts scanning the pages like a speedreader. \nINT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY \nBleachers are full.  They're now filming TAXI (the same scene as earlier).  On cue, Andy enters as LATKA -- wide- eyed, endearing, in mechanic's overalls. \nAndy is hilarious.  The crowd HOWLS with laughter. \nMONTAGE - TAXI \nIn quick succession, a series of Andy's best Latka moments. He's beloved.  The applause grows louder, louder, LOUDER... \nINT. TAXI SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY \nTAXI curtain calls.  The whole cast takes bows, then runs offstage.  Everyone is grinning -- except Andy. \nHe soberly strolls up to Zmuda. \nANDY I'm gonna quit. \nZMUDA What?!? \nANDY Each show is worse than the next. \nZMUDA Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week! \nANDY So?  What do they know? \nZMUDA Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty! (he lowers his voice) It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads! \nHmm?!  Andy raises an eyebrow. CUT TO: \nANDY Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice. (pause) That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together. \nMimi is bewildered, and offended. \nMIMI What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago. \nANDY (calm) No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling. \nMIMI I don't wanna talk about it! \nAn awkward silence.  They continue walking.  She points up. \nMIMI (cont'd) The sunset is really beautiful. \nANDY What do you mean? \nMIMI (a bit offput) I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day. \nANDY (he shrugs dully) I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark. (pause) But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED??? \nANGLE - MIMI \nFear.  She shivers, then hoarsely speaks. \nMIMI I think I wanna go home. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY \nGeorge screens Andy's TV Special for Maynard and his team. The network execs look constipated. \nON THE TV - Andy speaks tenderly, lovingly to Howdy Doody. ANDY (ON TV) You know... I was once in your gallery.  I was just sitting there and I wanted to touch you.  I was kind of depressed because I could see what everyone was like, and I was wondering if, now, maybe I could... touch you. \nVery gently, Andy touches Howdy's cheek and starts weeping. \nTHE EXECS -- are horrified. \nANDY (ON TV) (cont'd) Howdy, I've been watching you ever since I was a little boy... (choked up, nervous) You're the first friend from television I ever had.  I always wanted to meet you... and now ...I finally am. \nEXEC #2 This is NOT funny. \nEXEC #3 (ominous) \"Artsy Fartsy shit\"... \nGEORGE (worried at this response) No... eh, the Special isn't all like this... just wait... it will be hysterical. \nAt that moment, the picture turns to FUZZY SNOW.  Maynard scowls. \nMAYNARD Christ!  We're the Number One Network -- can't we afford decent TVs?! \nMaynard angrily jumps and POUNDS on the TV.  BANG, BANG! George winces -- then mutters awkwardly. \nGEORGE No, um... it's part of the snow. \nAn awful beat. \nMaynard is embarrassed.  Finally -- he explodes. \nMAYNARD Tell Kaufman we will NEVER air this program!! \nINT. JERRY'S DELI - NIGHT \nA delicatessen.  Andy wears an apron and angrily cleans tables.  He stacks dirty dishes and wipes up the food.  Two BLUE COLLAR GUYS gesture from a booth. \nBLUE COLLAR GUY 1 Excuse me, could I please have more coffee? \nANDY Yeah, yeah, in a sec'. (he lugs the dishes to the kitchen) That was decaf, right? \nThe guy nods.  Andy hurries over with the coffeepot and starts pouring. \nBLUE COLLAR GUY 1 You know, you look just like Andy Kaufman. \nANDY Yeah, I get that all the time. \nAndy hurries off.  The guy's buddy leans in, whispering. \nBLUE COLLAR GUY 2 I'm telling you, it's him. \nBLUE COLLAR GUY 1 You wanna bet??  If that was him, he wouldn't be workin' here, pouring my coffee! \nNEAR THE KITCHEN \nAndy dumps out wet coffee grounds.  He is sweating.  In the b.g., George enters the restaurant.  He sees Andy, sits at a table and YELLS OUT. \nGEORGE Hey!  Could you clear this table and bring me a piece of poundcake? \nAndy turns.  They stare down each other. \nGEORGE (cont'd) Andy, this is ridiculous.  Take off that apron. \nANDY (infuriated) NO!  I'd rather work here, than at ABC.  There's no lying in a restaurant.  They don't promise you a job as a cashier, then suddenly make you a frycook! \nAndy hurries off with a water pitcher.  George chases him. GEORGE Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like -- \nANDY The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special! \nGEORGE (trying to calm him) Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it -- \nANDY (bitter) Yeah, we can have a garage sale. \"Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!\" \nWEAK VOICE Do Latka. \nAndy looks up, shocked.  Insulted, he \"blows his temper.\" \nANDY (BRITISH) Look!  I don't have to tolerate this impoliteness!  Forget it -- I'm gonna stop the show.  GOODBYE! \nHe slams the book shut.  People CHEER.  Andy starts to storm off -- then turns. \nANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd) No, no, I'm only fooling. \nThe audience GROANS. \nANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd) I'll tell you what.  Would you rather have me continue reading or would you like to hear the phonograph record? \nThe audience ROARS for the record.  Andy smiles, puts the needle on and to everyone's horror more \"Gatsby\" comes out. ANDY (BRITISH-FROM THE RECORD) \"His presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness - it stands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer...\" \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT NIGHT \nThere are six people left in the audience.  Andy reads on. \nANDY (BRITISH) \"Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning - So we beat on, boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past.\" \nAndy somberly shuts the book. \nANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd) The End. \nA moment of quiet personal euphoria.  Andy looks enraptured, the man who has just climbed Everest. \nA pause -- but no applause.  It's dead silence.  Andy looks out... and realizes the few audience members are asleep. \nAndy shrugs, then shuffles off-stage. \nIn the wings, Zmuda snores loudly in a folding chair. \nEXT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - DAWN \nAndy and Zmuda walk out, Zmuda squinting groggily.  They drag the suitcase containing the props.  They walk slowly towards their rental car, the campus totally deserted. \nZMUDA Nobody likes anarchy more than me... but this is science fiction! \nAndy nods uncomprehendingly. \nANDY Let's get some breakfast. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY \nGeorge is yelling at Andy and Zmuda.  They are seated on his couch, heads bowed in shame. \nGEORGE What kind of show was this??! (angrily reading off a LIST) There were three-hundred walkouts! The promoter wants a refund! \nAndy mumbles in a pipsqueak whimper. \nANDY I'm sorry, George... \nGEORGE You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry! (turning on Zmuda) And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him! \nZMUDA (a guilty sigh) We might have lost our focus... \nGeorge paces furiously. \nGEORGE When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude. (beat) If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!! \nANDY But George, I like to push the boundaries... \nGEORGE And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care! \nHmm.  Andy thinks. \nANDY How long would they let me sleep? \nGEORGE I don't know! (he composes himself and lowers his voice to a hush) Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself? \nANGLE - ANDY \nHe doesn't know the answer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SHAPIRO/WEST, BATHROOM - DAY \nAndy is manically washing his hands.  Using liquid soap from the dispenser, then rubbing his hands under the water.  Then more liquid soap.  More rubbing.  Then more liquid soap... \nINT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY \nGeorge sighs at Zmuda. \nGEORGE I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work. \nZMUDA (he thinks) Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out. \nGEORGE Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice... \nZmuda mulls this over. \nCUT TO: \nHe points at Tony, swaggering around on the set.  George shakes his head. \nGEORGE But that's Tony down there.  That's not Andy.  Trust me, it's like \"Sybil\" -- Andy's nowhere on the premises! \nEd glares. \nED Well whoever the fuck that is, I'm firing him! \nGEORGE (he sighs) Okay.  But we'll have to warn Andy first.  I think he's up in San Francisco, doing a concert. \nHeh?  Ed raises his eyebrows. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - SECONDS LATER \nGeorge is on the phone.  Ed hovers. \nGEORGE (INTO PHONE) Hi, Diane, this is George.  I'm trying to reach Andy up in San Francisco. (a stilted pause) Yeah, I'll wait. \nEd glances down at the stage... and suddenly Tony is no longer there.  He's magically vanished. \nBeat. \nGeorge turns on the SPEAKERPHONE, then CLICK!  Andy's happy voice pops on the line. \nANDY (V.O.) Hi, George!  Good to hear from you! \nGEORGE Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there? \nANDY (V.O.) Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy! \nEd looks totally off-balance.  George winks at him. \nGEORGE I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony. \nANDY (V.O.) Oh no!  Did he get hurt? \nED No, no, Andy, nothing like that. (nervous beat) But... Tony's not fitting in.  His style of performance is too... burlesque. \nINTERCUT: \nINT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nTony is on the phone.  Little Wendy is busily refilling his whiskey bottle with canned ice tea.  He looks up, insulted. \nTONY CLIFTON (AS ANDY) \"Burlesque\"? \nBACK TO: \nINT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - DAY \nED Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him. \nANDY (V.O.) Oh dear! (upset) George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break. \nGEORGE There'll be other shots. \nED Andy, I have to do it.  He's a terrible actor. \nAndy thinks about this. \nANDY (V.O.) I guess I understand.  But Ed -- please... let him down gentle. \nED Yes, Andy, I will. \nAndy hangs up.  A relieved Ed turns to George. \nED (cont'd) Thank you. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY \nTony SCREAMS insanely. \nTONY CLIFTON FUCK YOU!  I AIN'T GOIN'!! \nWIDE \nEd is stupefied.  The cast stands nervously behind him. \nED We had a deal!! \nTONY CLIFTON I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else -- \nED Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman! \nTONY CLIFTON I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places. \nEd is livid.  He gazes harshly at Tony -- Tony's burning eyes piercing through the rubber features. \nED Get off my stage!  You're fired! \nTONY CLIFTON I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR! \nSuddenly -- FLASH!  Ed looks over.  A REPORTER has a camera. \nED Who're YOU?! \nANDY (V.O.) Okay.  See you next week. \nAndy hangs up.  Ed just sits there, astounded. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LA HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nAndy, Zmuda, George and Little Wendy are squeezed in a booth, laughing and celebrating.  They eagerly read the LA Times. \nINSERT - The headline says \"WHO IS TONY CLIFTON?\"  Below is a PHOTO of Tony being thrown off the Taxi set. \nThey all HOWL. \nANDY This is great!  It makes Tony REAL - - three-dimensional!  It's very good for his career. \nZmuda reads one paragraph. \nZMUDA \"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?\" \nANDY (he chortles) Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy! \nHmm.  A few awkward glances. \nThen -- Andy grins at his meal. \nANDY (cont'd) Boy, this is tasty. (he shouts to a WAITER) Hey, can I please have some more seaweed?! \nCUT TO: \nINT. BOOKER'S OFFICE - DAY \nA slick BOOKER, sitting in a crowded office full of head shots.  He's on the phone.  He's reading the LA Times story. \nBOOKER Mr. Shapiro, this is Gene Knight, up at Harrah's Tahoe.  We'd like to book Andy Kaufman for our showroom. \nINTERCUT: \nINT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY \nGeorge on the phone. \nGEORGE Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him. \nBOOKER (O.S.) Oh. \nDisappointed beat.  The booker thinks. \nBOOKER (O.S.) (cont'd) What about Tony Clifton? \nGEORGE (startled) Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe?? \nBOOKER (O.S.) (being tricky) Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman. \nGeorge winces. \nGEORGE Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman. \nBOOKER (O.S.) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know! (he LAUGHS merrily) Wink wink!  Nudge nudge! \nGEORGE (frustrated) No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY. \nBOOKER (O.S.) (LAUGHING harder) I'll take my chances!! \nGeorge rolls his eyes in annoyance.  Finally, he shrugs. \nGEORGE Fine, be my guest!  Book him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY \nGeorge is driving in his convertible.  Suddenly, something catches his eye -- and in shock he HITS the brakes.  Three cars behind him SCREECH crazily, trying not to hit each other. \nGeorge is oblivious.  He's staring up at a BILLBOARD. The BILLBOARD: It says \"HARRAH'S TAHOE PRESENTS, ANDY KAUFMAN & TONY CLIFTON!  TOGETHER ON STAGE!  ONE NIGHT ONLY!\" \nGeorge is flabbergasted. \nEXT. SUNSET BLVD, PHONEBOOTH - DAY \nGeorge is shouting into a payphone. \nGEORGE Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them! (upset) It's physically impossible! \nBOOKER (O.S.) Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman -- \nGEORGE Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen! \nBOOKER (O.S.) Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me! \nGeorge is stupefied.  He looks at his watch. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAKE TAHOE - DUSK \nMagnificent HARRAH'S dominates the skyline.  The marquee blares \"TONY CLIFTON AND ANDY KAUFMAN!\"  George screeches up in a rental car.  He jumps out and runs inside. \nINT. HARRAH'S SHOWROOM - NIGHT \nANDY Uh-huh!  See, with all these articles, people think they're insiders.  They see Tony Clifton, and they say, \"Ah, that's really Andy Kaufman.\"  But that spoils it. So NOW, Tony denying being me is the truth!  Tony's not me!  But maybe he is!  The audience will never know... (giddy) They'll think they're laughin' at me -- but actually I'll be laughin' at them, because they're wrong and I'm right! \nGeorge is dazed. \nGEORGE So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe. (dry) You... and you. \nZMUDA Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head! \nGEORGE (he turns serious) But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world? \nHmm.  Andy contemplates this. \nANDY George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do. (thoughtful) 'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them. \nGEORGE But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore. \nA perplexed beat. \nANDY George, it never was. (pause) Didn't you know that? \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nArnold Schwarzenegger, in his glory days as a body-builder, on the cover of a magazine.  Magazines are everywhere.  Body- building.  Women's.  Wrestling. \nANDY is sifting through them.  Zmuda watches, worried. \nANDY Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy! \nZMUDA What is this, World War Two...? \nANDY You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler... \nZMUDA No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge! \nAndy's face drops.  He realizes Zmuda's right. \nBeat -- then Andy notices an issue of Sumo Magazine, with a picture of a wrestler and his cute little fianc\u0439e on the cover.  He slowly lifts it up, intrigued. \nANDY Maybe I'll pick on someone smaller than me...! \nINT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - DAY \nCLOSE UP on Andy and Merv Griffin.  Andy wears a goofy wrestling outfit that resembles thermal underwear.  He is shouting like a wrestler. \nANDY ... And I vow to continue wrestling until I am BEA TEN, in a three- minute match, with my shoulders pinned to the mat!! \nMERV (nonplussed) By a woman. \nANDY Yes!  BY A WOMAN! (emphatic) I'm doing this because I feel that a woman cannot beat a man in wrestling.  Even if they train with weights... it requires a certain mental ability -- (a clumsy pause) And, uh -- I just don't feel they have that... \nThe audience MURMURS uncomfortably.  Andy laughs and backpedals. \nANDY (cont'd) No no!  Women are superior in many ways.  When it comes to cooking and cleaning, washing the potatoes, scrubbing the carrots, raising the babies, mopping the floors, they have it all over men.  I believe that! \nAn appalled silence. \nMerv winces.  Some people start BOOING.  We can tell Andy is pleased. \nANDY (cont'd) But when it comes to wrestling, forget it!  If there's a woman that can prove me wrong, come up here. I'll shut my mouth and pay her 500 dollars. \nMerv baitingly turns to the crowd. \nMERV Any... volunteers...? \nWIDE \nAll the WOMEN'S hands angrily shoot up! \nWe move through the crowd, finally picking out... a feisty woman, LYNNE.  She mutters, half hateful, half laughing -- \nLYNNE I wanna kill that jerk. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - MINUTES LATER \nAndy and Lynne stand in the ring.  She scornfully watches him preen about.  Zmuda is in a referee's uniform. \nZMUDA (AS REFEREE) Will you please shake hands, go to your corners, and come out wrestling. \nLynne extends her hand.  Andy fakes a shake -- then snidely refuses and struts away.  The crowd HISSES. \nDING!  It's the bell.  The match begins.  Lynne barrels at him, craving a victory, but terribly unprepared for this experience.  Andy immediately grabs her by the legs and flips her over. \nWHUMP!  She's down.  Andy has trained for this. \nZmuda gets on his knees, watching, trying to look official. Lynne struggles and slithers away. \nShe grabs Andy's arm and forces him down.  People CHEER. His torso hits the mat.  LOUDER CHEERS.  But suddenly he rolls over and pulls her hair!  Her head snaps back.  The crowd is INCENSED.  Zmuda hurries over and pantomimes a stern warning. \nAndy nods, and they separate.  They do a little dance around the ring, Lynne looking for a hole.  Suddenly, Andy spins her into a Half-Nelson.  Her arms are pinned.  They struggle, then he throws her down on her stomach.  One! Two!  Three! \nAnd DING!  It's OVER.  Andy jumps up and sneers at the crowd. \nANDY I'm the winner!  I've got the BRAINS! (he points at his head) Now baby, don't fight nature!  Get back in the kitchen where you belong!!! \nLynne glares. \nANDY (cont'd) Okay.  Let's go. \nLynne is baffled. \nLYNNE Andy, the theater's that way! \nANDY Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through \"On Golden Pond.\" \nLynne stands in place.  Andy smiles. \nANDY (cont'd) C'mon.  We'll go for a walk. \nLYNNE (beat; then she laughs) Fine. \nShe throws down her ticket and runs after him. \nEXT. MOVIE THEATER, STREET - DAY \nThey leave the theater and walk down the sidewalk. \nLYNNE Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you. \nANDY Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY \nANDY is standing in front, waiting.  A CAB stops and out steps -- Lynne. \nANDY Hi... \nLYNNE Hi... am I late? \nANDY No, I'm sure we'll be fine. \nAndy gives Lynne her ticket.  They enter the theater. \nINT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY \nAndy hurries up to the candy counter. \nANDY Popcorn? \nLYNNE No thanks. \nANDY I really want one. (at the counter) One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter. \nThe CANDY GIRL makes Andy his popcorn.  He pays... then heads to the exit. \nANDY (cont'd) Okay.  Let's go. \nLynne is baffled. \nLYNNE Andy, the theater's that way! \nANDY Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through \"On Golden Pond.\" \nLynne stands in place.  Andy smiles. \nANDY (cont'd) C'mon.  We'll go for a walk. \nLYNNE (beat; then she laughs) Fine. \nShe throws down her ticket and runs after him. \nEXT. MOVIE THEATER, STREET - DAY \nThey leave the theater and walk down the sidewalk. \nLYNNE Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you. \nANDY Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. \nLYNNE You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television. \nAndy is shocked. \nANDY Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you. \nLYNNE I'm here, ain't I? \nA charged moment.  Andy's eyes widen.  His speech gets faster. \nANDY Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married? \nLYNNE (incredulous) Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married? \nANDY Yes. \nBeat. \nLYNNE Why Memphis? \nANDY (he SPEAKS VERY FAST) Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say??? \nWhoa.  Lynne stares into his eyes. \nLYNNE And all this will be for real? \nANDY (a soft smile) If you want... \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRIDAYS SET, CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT \nThe tech crew is freaking out.  Maynard is oddly calm. \nTECH DIRECTOR Go to three!  Eh, go to four! \nCUT TO: \nINT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME \nStanley and Janice are flabbergasted.  Jaws wide. \nOn their TV - fists are flying.  Suddenly, the BAND kicks in and the show abruptly cuts to COMMERCIAL. \nThey stare at the TV.  Until -- \nSTANLEY I shoulda made him play outdoors. \nINT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT \nAndy and Jack are socking each other.  A FLOOR DIRECTOR screams at the top of his lungs. \nFLOOR DIRECTOR We've gone to commercial!  I said, WE'VE GONE TO COMMERCIAL!! \nAndy turns.  He notices the red lights are off -- and... instantly stops fighting.  Just like that.  Jack instantly stops too.  They glance at each other -- hold a beat -- then break into GUFFAWS.  They laugh and joyously kid each other. \nIn the audience, Michael is STUNNED. \nMELANIE Oh my God --! \nAll the commotion stops.  The audience doesn't know whether to laugh or boo.  The actors are flabbergasted -- then furious. \nMELANIE (cont'd) He's a fuckin' psycho! \nMARY Why didn't someone tell us??? \nSuddenly Maynard runs out of the booth, beaming.  People watch curiously. \nAndy seems discombobulated.  Maynard shouts out to EVERYBODY assembled. \nMAYNARD Excuse me!... I have an announcement to make!  You've all just participated in a \"happening.\"  To make it real, some of you knew, and some of you didn't. \nThe audience LAUGHS and APPLAUDS wildly.  The actors stare in disbelief.  One laughs hysterically.  Most are pissed. \nMAYNARD (cont'd) But we don't want to upset the folks at home.  So now Andy is now going to apologize and explain that it was all a prank.  Right, Andy? \nANDY (very quiet) Right... \nMAYNARD Okay, great!  So let's reset! \nCrew members start moving things around. \nIn the audience, Michael locks eyes with Andy.  An odd, knowing moment between the brothers.  Michael whispers, getting worried. \nMICHAEL Andy...! \nCUT TO: \nINT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME \nStanley and Janice feel as if the commercials are lasting forever. \nJANICE Why is Andy doing this?  Why?... Why? \nThe Fridays JINGLE starts, and Andy's face fades in on the TV.  He looks directly into the camera, nervous, stiff and serious. \nANDY (ON TV) During the commercial, the people at ABC asked me to apologize... and to tell you the truth.  They wanted me to explain that this whole fighting episode was staged... \nINT. FRIDAYS SET - NIGHT \nThe sign above blinks \"APPLAUSE\".  The audience obediently APPLAUDS.  In the booth, Maynard grins. \nANDY And... um... (choking up) I can't do this. (beat) I-I can't say it. (upset) It's a lie!  A cover-up! \nMaynard is suddenly very confused.  The crowd laughs nervously. \nANDY (cont'd) Why are you laughing?  I'm not trying to be funny!  They threatened to fire me from Taxi, unless I gave in to their demands! (shaken) But... I won't!  Because what you saw was REAL!! \nINT. FRIDAYS SET, CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT \nMaynard looks like he's gonna faint. \nMAYNARD Cue the commercial! \nANDY (ON TV) These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials. (he talks extremely fast, to get in as much information before he's cut off) Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis... \nAnd BLINK!  Andy gets CUT OFF. \nMaynard jumps up, furious.  He snaps. \nMAYNARD I'm gonna STRANGLE George Shapiro! \nINT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - SAME TIME \nThe parents stare at the commercials.  They're totally disoriented. \nJANICE What's in Memphis? \nSTANLEY Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) It's a side suplex!! \nAndy lies on the mat, unmoving.  Lawler doesn't care.  He picks up Andy's prone body and grips it upside-down.  Janice covers her eyes.  Stanley is worried. \nREFEREE (frantically gesturing) NO!  NO! \nLawler disregards the Ref and slams Andy's head in a pile- driver!! \nA horrible THUD. \nDING!  The BELL immediately RINGS. \nJANICE opens her eyes and SCREAMS. \nJANICE JESUS CHRIST!!!!! \nSTANLEY Why isn't he MOVING?? \nAndy's parents' reaction is a fiesta for photographers. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Lawler has committed a PILEDRIVER, which is an AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFICATION!  Match goes to Kaufman by disqualification, after two minutes, twelve seconds! Andy is splayed unconscious. \nRaging Lawler promenades around the ring, arms over his head.  The crowd SHOUTS CRAZILY, rooting him on. \nLynne runs to the ropes, SCREAMING for help. \nLYNNE ANDY!!!

A stretcher is lifted into the ring.  Andy is loaded on.  MUSIC fights the deafening NOISE. \nBEDLAM.  Andy is carried through the crowd, followed by his entourage.  A soft object HITS Stanley on the head. \nINT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nAndy is being carried by the Coliseum EMPLOYEES into the dressing room.  The entourage follows.

(beat) It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in. \nDeadpan, Andy sits up. \nTotal silence.  Stanley stares... then a FURY comes over him. \nSTANLEY Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking! \nAndy is splayed unconscious. \nRaging Lawler promenades around the ring, arms over his head.

Then KNOCKING. \nANDY Go away. \nLYNNE (O.S.) It's me. \nANDY Oh, it's open. \nThe door opens.  Lynne enters, holding a carton of ice cream. \nLYNNE I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate. \nANDY (mournful) I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person. \nLYNNE Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated. \nANDY You don't know the real me. \nLYNNE Andy... there is no real you. \nTIGHT - ANDY \nAn astonished silence. \nAnd then... he slowly smiles. \nANDY You're probably right. \nThey both giggle. \nAndy studies her... looking at Lynne's face, body, eyes. Pause. \nANDY Do you wanna move in together? \nLynne smiles slyly.  She leans down and kisses him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DAY \nA moving van outside a funky 60's house.

Mirrors get leaned against opposing walls -- and he finds himself looking into multiple reflections of himself. \nIn the b.g., Lynne arranges some vases, then hurries out. Andy opens a box and pulls out his old Howdy Doody doll.  He smiles, then places Howdy on the shelf next to the vases. \nSuddenly a phone on the floor RINGS.  He grins. \nANDY Hey!  Our first phone call! (he scrambles for the phone) Hello? \nGEORGE (V.O.) Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news. (long beat) Taxi's been canceled. \nSilence. \nAndy has no response. \nGEORGE (V.O.) (cont'd) Do you want me to come over?  Talk about it? \nANDY Um... no.  Uh, I'm sorta busy right now.  Thanks.  We'll get together next week. \nAndy hangs up.  He just sits there... confused... unsure how to react. \nAndy scratches his head -- then feels something odd.  He goes over to the mirror.  On the back of his neck... is an inflamed red pimple.  Andy grimaces. \nANDY (cont'd) Yuck! \nINT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - LATE NIGHT \nVery late -- a clock says 1:15.  A YOUNG COMIC is onstage, performing to the DOZEN audience members left. \nIn back walks... Andy.  Unshaven, morose, he quietly approaches paternal owner BUDD FRIEDMAN.  Budd sees him, grins, and gives him a hearty hug.  Andy points at the stage and asks for something -- Budd eagerly nods. \nINT.

Lynne leads George into the shrouded living room... and Andy is sitting in a Lotus position, concentrating.  In front is a WILD-HAIRED MAN in a purple robe. \nWILD-HAIRED MAN I want you to visualize.  Visualize big, healthy white cells in your body.  Now visualize little cancer cells.  Now those big white cells are attacking the cancer cells... \nANDY I see them... I see the white cells... \nIn the corner -- George stares.  He's fighting his skepticism. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY \nThe drapes are open.  Sunlight streams in.  Andy hugs the teacher goodbye, and the man leaves. \nGeorge has been waiting in back. \nGEORGE What was that all about? \nANDY It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease. \nLong beat. \nGEORGE He's an actor.  I remember him in \"The In-Laws.\" \nAh.  Andy's eyes widen.  His wheels are spinning fast. \nANDY Uh, yes... that's true.  But he's also ordained in holistic medicine. \nON GEORGE - He glares, stewing.  George is fed up. \nON ANDY - An unspoken tension.  Then suddenly, he breaks down. \nANDY (cont'd) George, what am I supposed to do?! I'm sick, and I'm tryin' to get better... but everyone's lookin' at me funny!  Even you come to my home and act like I'm puttin' on a skit! \nGEORGE You must take a little pleasure in it. \nANDY Of course! (beat) But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy. \nGeorge shakes his head. \nGEORGE Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy. \nANDY (thrown) Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead. \nAndy struggles to remain composed.  George sighs. \nGEORGE So how can I help you...? \nANDY I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show. (bright-eyed) The best show anybody's ever seen! \nGEORGE Do you wanna tour the clubs? \nANDY No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP! (beat) Carnegie Hall...! \nGeorge gently smiles. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NATIONAL ENQUIRER OFFICES - DAY \nA STAFF meeting at the National Enquirer. \nREPORTER #1 I'm working on a great cover story: I've got a guy in the lab at Cedars.

He's burned us too many times! \nREPORTER #2 Yeah, he's definitely not dying. He's playing Carnegie Hall next month! \nThe Reporter frowns. \nREPORTER #1 Jesus.  Only Kaufman would use cancer as a publicity stunt. \nINT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - NIGHT \nA 16mm PROJECTOR runs a scratchy 1930's movie short on the wall.

The crowd's gonna love this! (giddy; thinking) Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive? \nZMUDA I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80. \nANDY Well, call SAG.

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, CAFETERIA - NIGHT \nThe audience crowds inside... and LADY CAFETERIA WORKERS in hairnets are dispensing milk and cookies.  It's remarkable. \nAt a little kids table sit Andy and Lynne.  Andy's face is pure joy.

He squeezes Lynne's hand, then whispers. \nANDY I don't want this to ever end... \nEXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAY \nA stucco SPA RESORT sits in the middle of the rocky desert. \nINT. SPA - SAME TIME \nA room with soft lighting and billowing curtains.  A New Age HEALER is laying crystals upon Andy's body. \nAndy COUGHS.  His hat is off, revealing he's bald. \nHEALER Now we'll place a blue crystal. Very high vibrations.  It's wonderful for it's healing powers. \nANDY (spellbound) Okay.  Let's try two of those... and one of the pink ones. \nEXT. SPA - DAY \nZmuda stands with a swarmy ADMINISTRATOR. \nADMINISTRATOR Your friend is doing four crystal sessions a day, but it's just not helping. \nZMUDA I know... (beat) The cancer's terminal. \nADMINISTRATOR Yes.  That wasn't made particularly clear to us when he checked in... \nZMUDA (irked) Look, personally, I think rubbing rocks on people is a load of horseshit.  But if it makes Andy happy, that's all that matters. \nThe man purses his lips. \nADMINISTRATOR I'm sorry to sound crass -- but we don't want to be \"that health resort in New Mexico where Andy Kaufman died.\" (beat) I'm going to have to ask you to leave. \nZmuda is speechless. \nINT. SPA, ANDY'S ROOM - LATER THAT DAY \nZmuda angrily packs Andy's bags.  Zmuda is seething. \nBut Andy is strangely calm and unaffected. \nANDY It's okay, Bob.  It wasn't really working.

BAGUIO CITY, PHILIPPINES - DAY \nBaguio, a tiny scratched-in-the-dirt Philippine city. \nSuddenly, a rattletrap COMMUTER PLANE lurches out of the sky.  It hits a dirt runway.  Dust flies.  Chickens squawk and run. \nINT. BEAT UP TAXI, PHILIPPINES - DAY \nAndy, Lynne, and Zmuda ride through the impoverished city. \nAndy stares in amazement. \nEXT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY \nThey reach a brick building.  A sign says \"CLINIC,\" with an eye over a triangle. \nINT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY \nA NURSE hurriedly helps weakened Andy sign a bunch of forms. Money is handed over. \nAndy's clothes are stripped off.  They're thrown in a locker. \nINT. CLINIC OPERATION ROOM, PHILIPPINES - DAY \nA large white tiled room.  Lynne and Zmuda roll in pallid Andy, his limp body unmoving. \nAndy looks up... and there's a LONG LINE OF SICKLY PEOPLE. Primarily Japanese, emaciated, all stripped to their underwear and barely able to stand. \nThey have a look of desperation and reverence. \nAt the head of the line is JUN ROXAS at his work station: A bench, a sink, and ATTENDANTS with clean towels. \nA SICKLY WOMAN crawls onto the bench.  Jun impassively presses his hand into the fatty flesh of her stomach, kneading, searching.  Pause, then he removes some BLOODY GUTS. \nHe flings them into a bucket. \nThe woman cries out. \nAndy gasps. \nThe woman is helped away. \nJun turns to wash his hands.  An attendant gives him a towel to dry with.  Then a SICKLY MAN crawls up... \nAndy rolls closer.  He stares at all this with fear. Nervousness.  Hope. \nJun impassively presses his hand against the man's head.  He concentrates, searching... then pulls out some BLOODY GUTS. \nHe flings them into a bucket. \nThe man shakes.  He is helped away. \nAndy is wide-eyed.  He gets closer... closer... \nMore patients.  More bloody guts.  More sobbing. \nAndy's excitement builds. \nThen -- he reaches the front. \nA moment. \nLynne and Zmuda stare into Andy's eyes, drawn in by his total belief.  They are overcome.  It feels like they're saying goodbye.  Lynne gives Andy a tender kiss.  Zmuda starts to shake his hand -- and instead hugs him tightly. \nAndy smiles, then the attendants lift him from the wheelchair.  They help him up to the bench. \nAndy lies down.  Fluorescent lights buzz overhead. \nHe looks over, and Jun Roxas is washing his hands from the previous patient. \nAndy shivers, anticipating the miracle. \nJun turns.  An attendant gives him a towel to dry off. \nAndy relaxes, readying for it all... \nHe glances at Jun's hands.  Jun hands back the towel -- and under it the attendant quickly slips Jun a sack of animal intestines. \nJun discreetly palms it.  He's a fake. \nCLOSEUP - ANDY \nA moment of stunned disbelief. \nHe is shocked.  Outraged.  Disappointed.  Flabbergasted. \nThe faith is meaningless.  The joke is cosmic.  The con man has been conned. \nAndy's overpowering emotions coalesce... and he starts to LAUGH. \nIt's sidesplittingly funny.  Andy LAUGHS, and LAUGHS, and LAUGHS, like a crazy man with no salvation, the joy releasing him, the tears rolling down his cheeks. \nHis face flushes with color.  Life sparkles in his eyes. Andy laughs and guffaws until he's hoarse.  This is the best gag of them all. \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO: \n", "test1_input": "The thugs are dismayed. \nTHUG #1 Goddamn immigrants! \nTHUG #2 This guy's pathetic.  Let's go. \nHarsh glances.  They angrily turn and leave. \nAndy takes a nervous breath, then starts picking his things off the street.  He shouts after the guys: \nANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) Tank you veddy much...! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NY IMPROV - 1975 - NIGHT \nThe Improv, the biggest comedy club around.  People are lined up, waiting.  The man strides up -- GEORGE SHAPIRO, a Hollywood talent manager.  George is old school: Bronx accent, shmooze and a hug... but with a surprising sweetness that is quite disarming.  A DOORMAN sees him, grins, and waves George in. \nINT. NY IMPROV, BAR - 1975 - NIGHT \nThe bar is packed with COMICS and SHOW BIZ TYPES.  A few turn and smile -- \"George!\"  \"Hey, George!\"  George takes a couple hands, whispers to someone else, then drifts into the... \nINT. NY IMPROV, SHOWROOM - 1975 - NIGHT \nWhere the show's in progress.  Owner BUDD FRIEDMAN sees George and gives him a bear-hug.  Then he hustles George to a table. \nGeorge sits -- and gives the stage his undivided attention. Up there is a WISEASS COMIC. \nWISEASS COMIC So I'm getting my mother-in-law a special Christmas present: A pre- paid funeral!  The mortician asked me if I wanted her buried, embalmed or cremated.  I said, \"Make it all three!  I'm not takin' any chances!\" (the crowd LAUGHS) Thank you.  Good night! The comic waves and exits.  APPLAUSE.  George politely claps.  A PIANO PLAYER jumps in with an upbeat show tune. \nWe think there's a break... when Andy suddenly, awkwardly steps on stage.  He is in character as Foreign Man.  Pink jacket, tie, hair slicked back, frightened like a deer in headlights.  He puts down his big case, pulls out various junk, and arranges it on chairs. \nThe room hushes, uncertain as to who the hell this guy is. Andy tentatively grabs the mike.  The stagefright is agony. \nANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) Now?  Now...? (looking around) Tank you veddy much.  I am very happy to be here.  I tink -- this is a very beautiful place.  But one ting I do not like is too much traffic.  Tonight I had to come from, eh, and the freeway, it was so much traffic.  It took me an hour and a half to get here! \nAndy chuckles, as if this were a punchline. \nSilence.  The crowd is baffled. \nANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) But -- talking about the terrible things: My wife.  Take my wife, please take her. \nYikes.  A few NERVOUS LAUGHS. \nAndy gestures, as if they got the joke. \nANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) No really, I am only foolink.  I love my wife very much.  But she don't know how to cook.  You know, one time, she make a steak and mashed potato.  Ehh, and the night before, she make spaghetti and meatballs.  Her cooking is so bad... is terrible. \nPeople are embarrassed.  Some avert their eyes.  A couple hipsters laugh mockingly. \nGeorge leans forward.  Andy wipes the sweat from his brow. ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) Right now, I would like to do for you some imitations.  So first, I would like to imitate Archie Bunker. (no change in his voice) \"You stupid, everybody ees stupid! Ehh, get, get out of my chair Meathead... go in the, eh, Dingbat get into the kitchen, making the food!  Ehh, everybody ees stupid!  I don't like nobody, ees so stupid!\" Tank you veddy much. (pleased, he proudly bows) Now I would like to imitate Jimmy Carter, the President of the United States. (no change in his voice) \"Hello, I am Jimmy Carter, the President of the United States.\" \nSome people BOO and walk out.  A few giggle, getting into the groove. \nGeorge is intrigued. \nANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd) And now... I would like to imitate the Elvis Presley. \nA woman LAUGHS caustically.  Andy grins stupidly, then turns his back to us.  He presses \"Play\" on a CASSETTE RECORDER... and the THEME FROM 2001 starts playing. \nHouse lights dim dramatically.  With a flourish, Andy pulls tape off his pants -- revealing rhinestones.  He removes his pink coat -- putting on a white jeweled jacket. \nHe combs his hair. \nThen he brushes his hair. \nThen he combs his hair some more. \nFinally he picks up a guitar, strikes a pose -- and spins around. \nHe is ELVIS.  CONFIDENT.  SEXY.  LIP CURL.  DEAD-ON PERFECT. \nThe crowd is blown away. \nVegas Elvis INTRO MUSIC suddenly blasts.  Andy/Elvis swaggers stage left and takes a bow.  Then he goes stage right and takes a bow.  Then he returns stage left for another bow. \nMusic STOPS. \nANDY (AS ELVIS) Thank you very much. \nWow.  Flabbergasted, people APPLAUD.  This man is Elvis. \nSuddenly -- \"JAILHOUSE ROCK\" guitar kicks in. \nANDY (AS ELVIS) (cont'd) (SINGING) \"Warden threw a party In the county jail! Prison band was there And they BEGAN to WAIL!\" \nANGLE - GEORGE \nHe is astonished.  George cannot quite figure out what's going on... but he wants in. \nHe waves Budd over.  Budd leans down, and George WHISPERS. \nGEORGE Pst.  What's the story with this guy? \nBUDD I think he's Lithuanian.  None of us can understand him. \nGeorge nods admiringly. \nGEORGE He does a hell of an Elvis. \n", "test1_true": "INT. NY IMPROV, BACKSTAGE - 1975 - LATER THAT NIGHT \nAndy is packing up his things.  He very methodically folds each item of clothing, then checks the creases. \nGeorge strolls up. \nGEORGE Hey, I really enjoyed your set. \nANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) Tank you veddy much. \nGEORGE So I understand you're from Lithuania? \nANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) No.  Caspiar. \nGeorge is puzzled. \nGEORGE Caspiar?

(beat) Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk. \nGeorge hands him a BUSINESS CARD.  Andy reads it -- then his eyes pop.  He DROPS the accent. \nANDY Mr. Shapiro, it's an honor!! \nGeorge realizes it's all been an act.  He laughs heartily. \nGEORGE Caspiar, huh?! \nCUT TO: \nINT. SOHO HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA Bohemian health food restaurant, staffed by hippie waitresses in sandals.  Andy and George sit together, trying to get a sense of each other. \nANDY You see, I want to be the biggest star in the world. \nGeorge is surprised at this hubris. \nGEORGE People love... comedians. \nANDY I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent. (he shrugs) I'm a song-and-dance man. \nGeorge looks up at Andy -- and inexplicably there is a giant MOIST BOOGER hanging from Andy's nostril. \nGeorge cringes.  He doesn't know what to say. \nA waitress brings over two plates of awful 70's HEALTH FOOD -- seaweed, beans, stringy paste.  George frowns.  Andy beams. \nANDY (cont'd) Mmm!  I particularly recommend the Lotus root. \nAndy pulls out a little Handi-wipe and cleanses his hands. Then he starts arranging the food in compulsive little piles: Beans in pinwheel shapes.  Sprouts in piles. \nGeorge peers at the bizarre food behavior. GEORGE You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself? \nANDY (bright) I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall. \nGeorge is unsure if that's a joke. \nGEORGE Yeah, ha-ha.  That's funny. \nAndy dips his silverware in the water glass.  Two dunks, then he dries it with his napkin. \nGeorge stares, perplexed.  He looks back up -- and Andy's booger has suddenly switched nostrils. \nHuh? \nANDY See, I don't want easy laughs. \nAndy's about to eat -- but first bows his head in silent prayer.  George raises an eyebrow.  Andy snaps his head back up. \nANDY (cont'd) I want gut reactions!  I want that audience to go through an experience.  They love me!  They hate me!  They walk out -- it's all GREAT! \nAndy triumphantly eats a bean.  George peers, unable to take the booger anymore.  He hands Andy a napkin and points to his nose.  Andy nods, removes the rubber booger, and carefully puts it in a little box. \nANDY (cont'd) After I'm famous, I can sell these as \"Worn by Andy Kaufman.\" \nAnd at that... George is won over.  He smiles broadly. \nGEORGE You're insane. (then sincere) But -- you might also be brilliant. Alright, Andy... let's do it. \nGeorge warmly extends his hand. \nAndy slowly smiles, then takes George's hand.  The men shake.  A moment of supreme importance. EST. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY \nThe glitz strip of Los Angeles.  Money.  Beauty. \nINT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY \nReal working showbiz offices.  No glamour at all.

You've lost touch with reality! \nANDY (ingenuous) What, you don't think I can beat him? \nGEORGE He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you. (very disapproving) First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed! (dry) And I did the bookings. \nAndy shrugs, lacking a response.  He eats more cake. \nGEORGE (cont'd) Andy, look... there's a job I want you to take -- guest-hosting the TV show \"Fridays.\"  It's not so hot... but this is a great opportunity for you.  The show's live, they'll give you carte blanche, and you can get back to the business of making people laugh. \nAndy gets a strange gleam.  He only heard one thing. \nANDY You said -- live? \nINT.

He empties the clean clothes, puts them in a basket, and carries them to the rug.  Then he sits down and starts laying out pairs of socks in highly symmetrical patterns.  Focused, impassive, Andy pointlessly orders the socks like the world depended on it. \nLynne enters, emotionally wrecked.  She stares in frustration at Andy's behavior. \nLYNNE How can you be so casual??! \nANDY (he shrugs) Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks. \nLYNNE You're NOT DYING! \nANDY Okay.  You're probably right. \nHe keeps working.  Lynne loses it. \nLYNNE God, you're so detached!! \nLynne storms out. \nAndy finishes his socks.  Satisfied... he turns on the TV. \nON THE TV: It's \"Lassie.\"  Little TIMMY is laid-up in bed, with a broken leg.  Suddenly LASSIE runs in, holding a book. Lassie places the book on his lap.  The boy smiles gratefully. \nTIMMY (ON TV) Thank you, girl.  You're my best friend. \nTimmy warmly embraces the dog. \nANDY - is terribly touched.  Tears start rolling down his face. \nGenuine sobbing.  Terrible grief, until he wipes his cheeks. Andy collects himself, then reaches for a phone.  He dials a long number. \nANDY (on phone) Dad...? \nCUT TO: \nINT. CEDARS SINAI, RADIATION ROOM - DAY ANDY lies under the machine.  It bombards his body with powerful radiation. \nINT. CEDARS SINAI, DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe whole Kaufman family is gathered.  Stanley, Janice, Michael and Carol listen to a BLAND DOCTOR in a white coat. \nDOCTOR The cancer started in Andy's left arm and spread to his lungs.  We've initiated an aggressive radiation program... see if we can eradicate the affected cells. (his BEEPER goes off) Excuse me.  I'll be right back. \nThe doctor leaves.  A somber silence -- and then Janice bursts into tears.  Stanley hugs her tightly. \nCarol watches the doctor with great hostility.  His old tennis shoes are grabbing her attention.  He leaves, and she frowns. \nCAROL What a crock. \nSTANLEY (angered) How dare you make light of this! \nCAROL Dad, I cried when he broke his neck. He's not gettin' me again -- \nSTANLEY (impassioned) Jesus!  He's got lung cancer! \nA standoff moment.  Carol loses it. \nCAROL See, that's exactly it!  He picked lung cancer, because he doesn't smoke.  That makes it weird!  If he'd picked leukemia, it'd be totally believable, and we'd all be going, \"Poor Andy, he's really sick.\"  So he chose lung cancer, because he WANTS us to be scratching our heads, saying, \"Is this real?\" \nJANICE (trying to convince herself) Of course it's real.  We're in a hospital... \nMICHAEL Mom, it's Cedars-Sinai!  It's a showbiz hospital!  Andy's studio friends probably run this place! \nCAROL He plans these things out.  He takes over, hires actors... (beat) Personally, I didn't think that \"doctor\" was very convincing. \nMICHAEL Did you notice his costume had the wrong shoes? \nCAROL (excited) Yeah!  He didn't have doctor shoes! \nA moment of total silence.  All four of them look at each other.  Is there... a glimmer of hope? \nMICHAEL We all know he's talked about faking his own death... \nSTANLEY Sure -- but what if he isn't? (sad; poignant) My son could be dying... and we're actin' like we're on Candid Camera. \n", "test3_id": 2819}

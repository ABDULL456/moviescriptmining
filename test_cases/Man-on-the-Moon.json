We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman. \nGeorge winces. \nGEORGE Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman. \nBOOKER (O.S.) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know! (he LAUGHS merrily) Wink wink!  Nudge nudge! \nGEORGE (frustrated) No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY. \nBOOKER (O.S.) (LAUGHING harder) I'll take my chances!! \nGeorge rolls his eyes in annoyance.  Finally, he shrugs. \nGEORGE Fine, be my guest!

How can they be the same person --? \nPUSHY MAN Trust me!  You'll never see them on stage at the same time! \nThe onstage ORCHESTRA hits a fanfare.  LIGHTS DIM.  Sharp SPOTLIGHTS meet at the foot of the stage.  Suddenly -- Tony swaggers out, hands over his head in a gesture of triumph. \nThunderous APPLAUSE.  Tony beams.  The music stops. \nGeorge leans in, curious as to how Andy will wiggle out of this. \nTony bows theatrically, turns back to face the orchestra, and waits.  The NOISE LEVEL slowly drops -- but not entirely.  Tony waits, and waits, and waits... until suddenly he turns towards the audience and SCREAMS FURIOUSLY. \nTONY CLIFTON SHUT UP!!!!!! \nEverybody looks up, alarmed.  The general murmur almost dies.  Tony stands there, eyes flashing with anger at all the unruly people.  As they quiet down... Tony turns back to the orchestra and raises his arms.  The MUSICIANS lift their instruments.  Silence is total -- except for the clank of china. \nWaiters are serving coffee. \nTony spins back around, livid. \nTONY CLIFTON (cont'd) THAT APPLIES TO YOU, TOO, PENGUINS!!! \nPeople signal \"shh\"!  The waiters realize Tony's addressing them, and they stare back in disbelief!  This is their job! \nTONY CLIFTON (cont'd) Yeah!  Yeah!  YOU!  I'm talkin' to YOU!!  And you better freeze, or I'll get your asses fired!!! \nTony's outburst is so commanding that they all freeze.  The waiters stand there like statues, staring in terror. \nSatisfied, Tony burns back to the orchestra and raises his arms.  Again, the musicians lift their instruments.  In anticipation of loud music, the waiters start moving about. Audience members start whispering.  Tony hears this -- and drops his arms and head in despair. \nThe musicians lower their instruments.  Tony waits for absolute silence.  Only then does he signal the musicians to get ready again.  They do.  And then at that precise moment -- somebody DROPS a spoon. Tony jolts, as if hit by a current.  He drops his hands again, turns, and gives the perpetrator a murderous look. Then he turns again, lowers his head, and waits.  And waits. And waits. \nThe man at George's table WHISPERS to his wife. \nPUSHY MAN He's never gonna start!  Kaufman thinks this is funny! (beat) We've paid forty bucks for a show that's never gonna start! \nGeorge grins stupidly.  The silence is now deafening. Slowly, very slowly, Tony raises his arms.  Slowly... the musicians get their instruments ready.  Tony stands there, and stands, and stands, waiting for something... anything... to disturb the silence.  In vain.  Somebody COUGHS.  The whole scene repeats itself. \nFinally -- finally -- Tony is surrounded by total silence. Then, (only a moment before the length of this scene would become unbearable), he begins to move.  Tony pivots around, looks at the audience... \nAnd the entire room looks like Tussaud's Wax Museum.  Tony starts LAUGHING hysterically.  The audience's reaction is mixed: \nSome people LAUGH.  Some BOO.  Some ask perplexed questions. Some SCREAM OBSCENITIES.  Some even APPLAUD. \nTony is very happy.  He turns to the orchestra, raises his baton -- and commences the downbeat!  The MUSIC BEGINS. \nA SPOTLIGHT hits the wings... and then ANDY STRIDES OUT. \nGeorge's jaw drops. \nWIFE OF PUSHY MAN You see!  I told you!  They're not the same person! \nThe whole audience BURSTS INTO APPLAUSE.  Life is back to normal.  Andy bows shyly and takes his place in front of a prepared row of congas.  He starts to play. \nTony Clifton grabs the microphone. \nTONY CLIFTON Thank you!  Thank you!  I wrote this tune for my friend Frank Sinatra. He had a nice little success with it... but forgot to thank me on the album. \nHe starts to BELT \"I Gotta Be Me\". \nGeorge squints his eyes, trying to figure out who this is. \nTONY CLIFTON (cont'd) \"Whether I'm right Or whether I'm wrong Whether I find a place in this world Or never belong! I gotta be me!  I gotta be me! What else can I be, but what I am?\" \nTony's singing is awful.  Andy happily accompanies on congas.  The audience doesn't know what to think. \nTony's SINGING reaches the end... aggressive and off-key. \nTONY CLIFTON (cont'd) Let's bring it on home -- (he hits his screeching CLIMAX) \"I GOTTA BE MEEEEEE!\" \nThe BAND ends with a brassy punch.  The crowd responds with LOUD BOOING. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HARRAH'S, BACKSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT \nGeorge wanders the corridor, looking for the dressing rooms. He turns and finds a door marked \"KAUFMAN\".  Next to it is a door marked \"CLIFTON\". \nGeorge stares.  He thinks, then opens the \"KAUFMAN\" door. \nAndy is inside alone, gathering his things.  He's pleasantly surprised to see George. \nGeorge doesn't enter.  He goes to the \"CLIFTON\" door.  Andy follows.  George opens the mystery door... \nINT. HARRAH'S, CLIFTON'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT \nand inside, taking off the rubber Tony makeup, is Zmuda. \nGeorge starts hyperventilating.  Shaking, he tries to sit himself down.  Andy enters, beaming.

Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say??? \nWhoa.

But Andy remains in his corner, running down the clock.  He nonchalantly peels off his robe.  Foxy dances around impatiently.  Andy casually removes a towel from his neck. People BOO.  Still stalling, Andy then takes off his watch. \nPeople SCREAM so furiously they're red-faced.  Andy is tormenting them.  A TATTOOED GUY jumps up. \nTATTOOED GUY Are you scared??? \nAndy sneers.  He cracks his knuckles, finally walks over... and commences a WINDMILL.  Absurdly, he spins his arms around and around, daring Foxy to get near him. \nShe rolls her eyes and waits.  The REF jumps out of the way. A minute has counted down.  Finally, Andy stops -- and the real wrestling begins.  Foxy lunges at him and immediately goes for a choke-hold.  The crowd CHEERS, relieved.  Lawler motions signals.  Foxy yanks -- but Andy jerks away. \nAndy is intrigued.  She's coming to play!  Andy gestures to the Ref and points UP.  The Ref looks away -- and Andy SLAPS Foxy. \nThe crowd furiously JEERS.  The Ref spins around, and Andy shrugs innocence.  He then runs at Foxy and theatrically pushes her into the ropes.  She bounces off, stumbles back - - and Andy drops to his knees.  She trips over him and hits the mat. \nAndy aggressively jumps onto Foxy's shoulders and pins her. The Ref counts:  One!  Two!  Three!  DING!! \nIt's over.  But Andy stays on her, shaking his ass, leering rudely.  Jerry Lawler yells from the corner. \nLAWLER Alright, you won.  GET OFF HER! \nAndy remains, flapping his arms like a chicken. \nTHE BOOING grows.  Louder.  More emotional. \nANGRY VOICES Jerry, help her!  Get in there!  Do something! \nLawler hesitates -- then suddenly climbs in the ring and lifts Andy off!  Lawler angrily PUSHES Andy down. \nAndy is flabbergasted. \nANDY W-what are you DOING?  I don't fight men! \nLawler snickers and walks away.  Completely overreacting, Andy grabs the mike. \nANDY (cont'd) I'm gonna SUE YOU! (he starts RANTING berserkly) Let me tell you something, Lawler! I am not a hick -- I'm a national TV star!  And I DON'T like a dumb cracker pushing me around in the ring!  I never agreed to wrestle you!  So you know what I'm gonna do??? (seething) I'm gonna hire a lawyer to sue you for every cent you've got!  This was assault and battery!  In a court of law, I'm gonna kick your Southern- fried rump!!! \nLawler snatches the mike and bellows. \nLAWLER YEAH?!  Well I got news for you, Andy Kaufman!  Wrestling is a serious sport to me!  I don't like anyone makin' fun of it, and I hate anyone insultin' the South!  So we can settle this two ways: We can go to court... or you can get in the ring with a man, and wrestle for REAL! \nAndy watches, fuming.  He is INFURIATED. \nANDY He -- can't get away with this.

You wanna \"WRAAASTLE\" me???  Okay, Lawler -- let's rumble!  Yeah, I've only wrestled women, but they were bigger than you!  In fact, they're probably smarter than you, 'cause you're from \"Maaamphis, Taaanassee!\" (back to his regular voice, he points at his head) I'm from Hollywood.  I have the brains.  That's how I win.  And Mr. Lawler, I'm gonna make you cry \"Mama!\" \nAndy bears his teeth.  Enraged, Lawler tries to take a swing at him.  HANDLERS run in and separate the angry men. \nEXT.

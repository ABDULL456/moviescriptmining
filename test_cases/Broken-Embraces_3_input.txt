ERNESTO I don't know. But the mother has told me he is a bit faggot. If I ask him to come I would like for you to tell me if that's true... and whether you think there's any remedy... 
LENA And how would I know?! What an idea! 
ERNESTO I am not asking you to fuck him, but you good-looking girls can tell these things. 
LENA Call him, but you can't count on me for the rest. 
Ernesto approaches the telephone and dials a number. 
46. ERNESTO MARTEL'S MANSION. (2008). INT. NIGHT. 
Fourteen years later ­ in the same room, decorated differently, (more modern, more colorful), although it still retains some noble and timeless furniture pieces and the same layout ­ Ernesto Junior (we in effect confirm that this is Ray X) speaks on the telephone while getting dressed to leave for a party. In that very room, another man (young, handsome and ambitious) is getting dressed in front of a piece of furniture equipped with a mirror, at the very spot Lena had been 
earlier. (This piece of furniture is not the same one as the one fourteen years earlier, this is a more masculine piece, the other one was a type of boudoir). 
OFF EX-WIFE I am not reproaching you for our separation but that you live with a man... What will your children think! 
ERNESTO JUNIOR (On the phone) That their father is a homosexual (he gazes at his handsome boyfriend) and that he has very good taste. If they love me and you don't set them against me, they will accept it. 
OFF EX-WIFE You should have told me before we married! 
ERNESTO JUNIOR If you hadn't been so exclusively concerned with my father's fortune you might have noticed it yourself. 
The ex-wife grumbles furiously. The beautiful boyfriend continues to dress and smiles at Ernesto. Another telephone rings. 
ERNESTO JUNIOR I have to go, I have another call. 
47. ERNESTO SON'S MANSION. INT. NIGHT 2008 
47 A. JUDIT'S PRODUCTION OFFICE. INT. NIGHT. 
ERNESTO J.'s LOVER Will it be your other ex-wife? 
ERNESTO JUNIOR I hope not. (Into the headset) Yes? 
JUDIT (Dryly) It's Judit Garcia. 
ERNESTO JUNIOR Oh, hello, Judit. (In an amiable tone) Did you get the money? 
JUDIT I don't want it! I just sent it back, Ernesto! 
She emphasizes his name. 
ERNESTO JUNIOR You won't call me Ray? It's my artistic name... 
JUDIT Artistic? What are you up to? 
ERNESTO JUNIOR Hoping to erase my father's name. 
JUDIT And what does that have to do with Harry? 
ERNESTO JUNIOR I've been wanting to see him for a long time. And it's true that I want to shoot a movie and that I want him to write the script. (Looks at the boyfriend) I've got the protagonist. 
The boyfriend catches the allusion. 
JUDIT You are not a director! 
ERNESTO JUNIOR You should take a look at my documentary, you'd change your mind. 
JUDIT Ernesto, forget about us! 
ERNESTO JUNIOR Don't be afraid of me. I am not my father. 
JUDIT Do not come near Harry again. If you ever stop by his house again I will report you for harassment. 
And she hangs up the phone. At that very moment Judit is in her office with the American production team. She apologizes and attempts to recover her calm before undertaking the subject of the meeting at hand. 
48. JUDIT'S HOME. JUDIT'S BEDROOM. INT. NIGHT. 2008 
The house is not very big, but it is large enough for two people. It's discretely feminine and very practical. The details indicate that an independent woman lives there, as well as a young-man, twenty- five years old. There is some detail of the décor (the curtains, for example) that is replicated in Harry's home. It is clear that Judit has had a hand in setting up the writer's home. 
Judit is packing her bags, she paces back and forth. She is a bit overwhelmed, with multiple thoughts crossing her mind. At times, she asks for Diego's help. 
JUDIT I am not at all pleased with having to scout outside Madrid, but the Americans pay a bundle and we need money. 
DIEGO You can leave without concerns. Don't worry about me. 
JUDIT I am also worried for Harry. (Sounds more like an order than a request) Please, look after him during my absence... 
DIEGO (Protests) I have things to do, mom. I can't look after him all day. 
JUDIT It's only two weeks! 
DIEGO Harry manages perfectly on his own and right now we are not writing anything. 
Acknowledges the reason for her worry. 
JUDIT I am worried about Ernesto Junior's visit. I would like for you to be on guard in case he appears or calls and then let me know immediately! 
DIEGO Why are you so worried? 
Judit stops what she's doing, and takes a moment to take a deep breath.

ROSASHARN An' you won't let nobody touch me? 
MA No--an' look what I got for you. 
Smiling mysteriously, Ma fishes in a pocket in her dress and brings out the envelope of her treasures. From it she produces the earrings and holds them up in front of Rosasharn's wide eyes. 
MA (softly) I used to wear these--when your pa come callin' on me. (Then as she puts them on Rosasharn's ears) You'll look pretty in 'em tonight. 
They smile at each other, proud in the luxury of ornaments. 
Down the road from the GATE a touring car with six men pulls of the pavement and stops. Three men get out. They are bareheaded and dressed similar to the other migrants. They stroll down the highway toward the gate. The other men, deputies, sit watching them. 
WITHIN THE GATE: 
WILKIE They tell me you're half Injun. You look all Injun to me. 
JULE No, jes' half. Wisht I was full- blooded. Gov'ment'd be lookin' out for me an' I'd be ridin' around in a Buick eight. 
The three men from the touring car are at the gate. Wilkie and Jule watch them. 
COMMITTEE MAN Who give you the invitation? 
MAN Fella named Jackson--Buck Jackson. 
COMMITTEE MAN Okay. Come on in. 
The three men stroll past Wilkie and Jule, whose eyes follow them. 
JULE Them's our fellas. 
WILKIE How you know? 
JULE Jes' got a feelin'. They're kinda scared too. Follow 'em an' get a holt of Jackson. See if he knows 'em. I'll stay here. 
Wilkie moves after them. 
We see the DANCE FLOOR. The musicians are at it and the fiddler is calling turns. 
FIDDLER Swing your ladies an' a dol ce do. Join han's roun' an' away we go! Swing to the right an' a swing to the lef'. Break, now break--back to back! 
Well in front, among the older folks and children who surround the floor, are Ma and Rosasharn, clinging close. A young man stops in front of them. 
MA (quietly) Thank you kin'ly but she ain't well. 
As Rosasharn's eyes drop. Ma bends toward her, a shy smile on her face. 
MA Maybe you wouldn't think it, but your pa was as nice a dancer as I ever seen, when he was young. (With a little sigh) Kinda makes me think a ol' times. 
The three men stroll into sight and stand watching the dancing. One glances at Ma and Rosasharn but does not speak. Ma has smiled back at him. 
WILKIE AND JACKSON are seen; removed somewhat from the dance floor they are peering in the direction of the three men. 
JACKSON I seen 'em before. Worked at Gregorio's with 'em. But I never ast 'em. 
WILKIE Awright. Keep your eye on 'em. Jus' keep 'em in sight, that's all. (He moves quickly away) 
We find ourselves INSIDE TIM WALLACE'S TENT.  The five members of the central committee, Tim Wallace, chairman, look grave as a 15-year-old boy reports. 
BOY I seen 'em, Mr. Wallace. A car with six men parked down by the euc'lyptus tree an' one with three men on the main road. They got guns, too. I seen 'em. 
TIM Thank you, Willie. You done good. (As Willie exits) Well, it looks like the fat's in the far this time. 
FIRST MAN (angrily) What them deppities want to hurt the camp for? How come they can't leave us be? 
SECOND MAN What we oughta do, we oughta git us some pickhandles an'-- 
TIM (quickly) No!  That's what they want. No sir. If they can git a fight goin', then they can run in the cops an' say we ain't orderly-- (He stops as Wilkie enters followed by Tom)

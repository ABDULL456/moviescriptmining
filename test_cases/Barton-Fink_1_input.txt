HIS POV 
The empty hallway, a pair of shoes before each door. At the end of the hall a dim red bulb burns over the door to the staircase, punctuating the sick yellow glow of the line of wall sconces. 
The laughter, though still faint, is more resonant in the empty hall. 
Perhaps its quality has changed, or perhaps simply because it is so insistent, the laughter now might be taken for weeping. 
Barton pauses, trying to interpret the sound. He slowly withdraws into his room. 
HIS ROOM 
Barton looks down at his typewriter for a beat. The laughter/weeping continues. 
He walks over to his bed, sits down and picks up the house phone. 
BARTON Hello... Chet? This is Barton Fink in room 605. Yes, there's uh, there's someone in the room next door to mine, 604, and he's uh... He's uh... making a lot of... noise. 
After a beat: 
BARTON ...Thank you. 
He cradles the phone. The laughter continues for a moment or two, then abruptly stops with the muffled sound of the telephone ringing next door. 
Barton looks at the wall. 
The muffled sound of a man talking. 
The sound of the earpiece being pronged. 
Muffled footsteps next door. 
The sound of the neighbor's door opening and shutting. 
Footsteps approaching the hall. 
A hard, present knock at Barton's door. 
Barton hesitates for a beat, then rises to go get the door. 
ON THE DOOR 
As Barton opens it. Standing in the hall is a large man  a very large man  in short sleeves, suspenders, and loosened tie. His face is slightly flushed, with the beginnings of sweat. 
MAN Did you... Somebody just complained... 
Hastily: 
BARTON No, I didn't  I mean, I did call down, not to complain exactly, I was just concerned that you might  not that it's my business, but that you might be in some kind of... distress. You see, I was trying to work, and it's, well, it was difficult  
MAN Yeah. I'm damn sorry, if I bothered you.  The damn walls here, well, I just apologize like hell... 
He sticks his hand out. 
MAN ...My name's Charlie Meadows. I guess we're neighbors... 
Without reaching for the hand. 
BARTON Barton Fink. 
Unfazed, Charlie Meadows unpockets a flask. 
CHARLIE Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink. 
BARTON That's all right, really, thank you. 
CHARLIE All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say? 
As he enters: 
CHARLIE ... You got a glass? It's the least I can do. 
BARTON Okay... a quick one, sure... 
He gets two glasses from the wash basin.  Charlie sits down on the edge of the bed and uncorks his flask. 
CHARLIE Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door. 
BARTON That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work  
CHARLIE What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking? 
BARTON Well, I'm a writer, actually. 
CHARLIE You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine. 
BARTON Can be. Not easy, but  
CHARLIE Damned difficult, I'd imagine. 
As he hands Charlie a glass: 
BARTON And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?

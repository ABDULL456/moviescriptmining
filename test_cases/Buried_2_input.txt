PAUL I should have never come here. You were right. I'm sorry. 
LINDA Sweetie, I don't care. I just want you home. Please come home to me. 
PAUL I will. 
LINDA Swear it. 
PAUL I will. I swear I will. Paul then receives a call on the other line. He checks to see who's calling. It's Dan Brenner. 
PAUL (CONT'D) They're here! 
LINDA The people? 
PAUL They're calling me right now. I have to go. 
LINDA Call me right away. 
PAUL I will. I love you. 
LINDA I love you. Swear it again. 
PAUL I swear. I have to go. Paul clicks over to the other line, where Dan Brenner waits to speak with him. We hear Dan yelling to people who are with him. A great deal of commotion and action is heard through the phone. 
DAN Move! Move! Let's go. 
PAUL Brenner? 
DAN Paul? Paul? 
PAUL It's me. 
DAN We're here! Dan yells to one of the soldiers who are with him. 
DAN (CONT'D) Corporal, get your men over here! Dan gets back on the phone with Paul 
DAN (CONT'D) He brought us right to you. 
DAN (CONT'D) (to the soldiers) Start digging! Let's go, let's go! The flashlight fades. Paul hits it, momentarily returning it to full strength. Meanwhile, the sand inside the coffin has almost reached the very top. It continues to pour in from the crack, seemingly faster than ever. Paul struggles to keep his head above the sand, giving him only a few inches between his face and the top of the coffin. 
PAUL You have to hurry. It's almost full. 
DAN Just hang in there!

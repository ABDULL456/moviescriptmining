We see and hear a huge roaring fire. Jimmy has zoomed the lens in so close that we can't tell what it is that's burning. 
As he pulls out, it's revealed that the dead homeless guy is roasting in the fire. 
JUDY (O.C.) (coughing) Oh, my god. The hair burning is making me nauseous. 
Judy coughs more violently before. 
JIMMY (O.C.) Yeah, God damn. Burning bodies fucking stinks. That bum's body odor is being cooked right off him. 
Jimmy pokes the flaming skull with his stick. 
JUDY (O.C.) Jimmy! 
Jimmy pokes some more at the body, then flips the camera up at Judy. 
JUDY What?    I'm not in the mood. 
JIMMY (O.C.) (making light) Don't have to be in the mood. Doesn't matter. The camera's on, it's on. (changes the subject) You wanna know where we're gonna go? 
JUDY Okay, where are we gonna go? 
JIMMY (O.C.) We're going to Lincoln to visit Dinko. 
JUDY Who's Dinko, Jimmy? 
JIMMY (O.C.) He's cool. And he's got his own place, and he said I could stay there whenever ever I wanted. Plus he knows about you and he wants to meet you. And he doesn't like cops, so he's not gonna call 'em. Okay? Now gimme a smile. 
JUDY No. 
JIMMY (O.C.) Gimme a smile, and I'll let you see my smiley face again. 
Judy begins coughing. 
JUDY I can't get sexy with that smell. I just can't. 
Camera shuts down. 
CAMERA ON: 
INT. DINKO'S TRAILER - NIGHT 
Music is playing extremely loud in a funky ass trailer as Judy dances with DINKO (late 20s) a completely drunk trailer trash dude wearing a pizza delivery outfit. 
Empty whiskey and beer bottles are scattered throughout the tiny living room as cigarette smoke hovers around them due to a ridiculously low ceiling. 
Judy is dancing in a very sexy manner with Dinko who is dancing like a complete dork. Dinko has no moves, rhythm, or beat whatsoever, but dances with as much vigor as a dog on crack. 
Jimmy is sitting on the couch filming them dancing in front of him. Dinko is forced to scream over top of the music to be heard. He looks directly at Jimmy noticing that Jimmy's turned on the camera. 
DINKO Hey! The video-man. I remember that shit when we was in together. Said you video-ed everything. 
JIMMY (O.C.) Yep. 
DINKO Hey man, it's cool if you guys stay here for a while, but I have a small business to run man. There's going to be some people knocking on the door and shit. I can't have you guys answering the door or the phone. That's the only rule. Other than that man, we're going to getting fucked up together all the time. I got a shit load of crank dude, that shit is off the fucking hook. Here, take a hit. 
Dinko tries to hand off some crank to Jimmy. 
JIMMY (O.C.) No thanks, I just want to film Judy dancing. 
Jimmy pans the camera over towards Judy.    She's doing her best sexy dance into the camera. 
We can still hear Dinko talking to Jimmy. 
DINKO (O.C.) Right man. That's cool. Hey um... If I tell you to stop taping though, man, you gotta stop. I got some hard core junkies coming over here. Sometimes, if they see shit like that, they fucking flip. Crank junkies are a whole different kind of breed man. They're fucking hard core mother fuckers. You don't know what they're gonna fucking do. This one guy got paranoid about something. He used to climb on his roof to take a dump. That's the only place he would shit! How fucked up is that? 
Dinko laughs at his own joke. 
JUDY You're not even paying attention to me Jimmy. 
Judy takes her dancing up a notch to get Jimmy's attention. 
JUDY Don't I look sexy? 
Jimmy doesn't get a chance to respond. 
DINKO (O.C.) Yeah, you look real sexy baby. Real nice. 
Dinko starts in with Jimmy again. 
DINKO (O.C.) Hey, I may have some work for you if you're cool with that. 
Jimmy turns the camera back to Dinko while he goes to the kitchen to get a beer. 
JIMMY (O.C.) What kind of work? 
DINKO You know some hustling, some good money. I'll teach you how to mix the shit. Your girlfriend too if she wants. 
JIMMY (O.C.) (sarcasm) Yeah. That's what I've always wanted to do. Learn to make and sell crystal methamphetamine. You're a fucking genius Dinko. 
Dinko is too stupid to recognize sarcasm. 
DINKO (big smile) Yeah, man! Fuckin' high five.

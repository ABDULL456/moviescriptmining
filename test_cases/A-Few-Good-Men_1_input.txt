JO Where I've earned two distinguished service medals and two letters of commendation. 
KAFFEE Why are you always giving me your resume? 
JO Because I want you to think I'm good lawyer. 
KAFFEE I do. 
JO No you don't. (beat) I think you're an exceptional lawyer. I watch the jurors, they respond to you, they like you. I see you convincing them. I think Dawson and Downey are gonna end up owing their lives to you. 
KAFFEE (pause) Jo... I think you have to prepare yourself for the fact that we're gonna lose. (beat) Ross's opening speech, it was all true. (beat) I mean, let's pretend for a minute that it would actually matter to this jury that the guys were given an order. We can't prove it ever happened. (beat) We'll keep doing what we're doing, and we'll put on a show, but at the end of the day, all we have is the testimony of two people accused of murder. 
JO We'll find Markinson. 
KAFFEE Jo, we're gonna lose. And we're gonna lose huge. 
We HOLD on then for a moment, and in VOICE OVER hear 
HOWARD (V.O.) Corporal Jeffrey Owen Howard, Marine Barracks Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
CUT TO: 
CORPORAL HOWARD, the young marine who drove the lawyers around Cuba, is on the stand. 
KAFFEE Corporal Howard, name some reasons why a marine would get a code red? 
HOWARD Being late for platoon or company meetings, keeping his barracks in disorder, falling back on a run... 
KAFFEE Have you ever received a code red? 
HOWARD Yes sir. We were doing seven man assault drills, and my weapon slipped. It's just cause it was over a hundred degrees and my palms were sweaty and I'd forgot to use the resin like we were taught. 
KAFFEE And what happened? 
HOWARD That night the guys in my squad threw a blanket over me and took turns punching me in the arm for five minutes. Then they poured glue on my hands. And it worked, too, 'cause I ain't never dropped my weapon since. 
KAFFEE Was Private Santiago ever late for platoon meetings? 
HOWARD Yes sir. 
KAFFEE Was his barracks ever in disorder? 
HOWARD Yes sir. 
KAFFEE Did he ever fall back on a run? 
HOWARD All the time, sir. 
KAFFEE Did he ever, prior to the night of August 6th, receive a code red? 
HOWARD No sir. 
KAFFEE (beat) Never? 
HOWARD No, sir. 
KAFFEE You got a code red 'cause your palms were sweaty. Why didn't Santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one? 
HOWARD Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir. 
KAFFEE Dawson wouldn't allow it. 
HOWARD The guys talked tough about Santiago, but they wouldn't go near him. They were too afraid of Dawson, sir. 
ROSS Object. The witness is characterizing. 
KAFFEE I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever want to give Santiago a code red? 
HOWARD Yes sir. 
KAFFEE Why didn't you? 
HOWARD 'Cause Dawson'd kick my butt, sir. 
KAFFEE Good enough. Lt. Ross is gonna ask you some questions now. 
ROSS takes three books out of his briefcase and puts them on the table. He brings one to HOWARD. 
ROSS Corporal Howard, I hold here The Marine Guide and General Information Handbook for New Recruits. Are you familiar with this book? 
HOWARD Yes sir. 
ROSS Have you read it? 
HOWARD Yes sir. 
ROSS Good. (hands him the book) Would you turn to the chapter that deals with code reds, please. 
HOWARD Sir? 
ROSS Just flip to the page in that book that discusses code reds. 
HOWARD Sir, you see, Code Red is a term we use -- it's just used down at GITMO, sir. I don't know if it actually -- 
ROSS has produced another book. 
ROSS We're in luck, then. The Marine Corps Guide for Sentry Duty, NAVY BASE Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I assume we'll find the term code red and its definition in this book, am I correct? 
HOWARD No sir. 
ROSS No? Corporal Howard, I'm a marine. Is their no book, no manual or pamphlet, no set of orders or regulations that let me know that, as a marine, one of my duties is to perform code reds? 
HOWARD (pause) No sir. No books, sir. 
ROSS No further questions.

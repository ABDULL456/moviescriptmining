OCK takes a sip from the THERMOS and flicks on the small TAPE RECORDER. 
OCK We are new inserting Peter Parker's data on tonight's Planetary Conjunction. 
INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays Peter Parker's name and ID number and the title, "The Planetary Conjunction and it's effect on Earth Gravity." 
OCK Yes, yes! Go on! Go on! 
INSERT: NUMBER SEQUENCES appear on the SCREEN. Then a GRAPHIC of the EARTH moving into line with SATURN, JUPITER, the SUN and the MOON. In the corner a NUMBER rises. 
OCK Enormous. It's enormous. (to recorder) The Parker calculations add 4% gravitational force at the moment of full Planetary Conjunction. (hits some keys) Adding this to present maximum power potential, I get... 
He looks up and sees the SCREEN a GRAPHIC "HOLE" opening up right through the EARTH! The widening HOLE is swallowing everything! 
OCK I knew it. I knew it! Universal destruction! It's doable! I am putting a countdown clock on the Planetary Conjunction now! 
A LARGE DIGITAL DISPLAY reads, "13:00:03." The last seconds count down to, "12:59:59!" 
OCK (playing the computer) Okey, dokey. Now let's see if I have enough power to drive this beast. 
He starts hitting KEYS on his COMPUTER. 
INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
PETER is working on LIZ'S COMPUTER. There is a KNOCK at his brand new, unpainted DOOR. He hurries to it and pulls the KNOB so quickly (forgetting his own strength) that the whole assembly comes off in his hand. 
PETER (pulling Harry aside) I gotta remember to have that fixed. (opens the door) There you are, I've been looking for you all over town. 
HARRY What happened? 
PETER Where were you? 
HARRY I went to the wrestling, wanted to see that Amazing Spider-Man, but he didn't show up. 
PETER Listen, Harry something terrible happened. 
HARRY What? What? 
PETER My Planetary Conjunction papers... they were stolen... 
HARRY Oh my God... Are you sure...? Who would do such a thing? 
PETER Ock... 
HARRY Of course... but why...? 
PETER We have to find out, sit down. (indicates computer) I want to access Dr. Octavius' main program. I want to know about his experiments with the cyclotron. Can you do it? 
HARRY (starts hacking) I can try. I could access the system in the dorm. Okay. And through that I could crack the main line. 
PETER Alright. Now if we can just disrupt the Octavius file... 
HARRY Okay, let's try. 
HARRY cracks his knuckles like a safe cracker and bends to the task. The PHONE RINGS. PETER hits his jerry-rigged SPEAKER PHONE. HARRY keeps hacking. 
PETER Yeah? 
JAMESON (V.O.) Parker? Peter Parker? This is J. Jonah Jameson! 
PETER (looking over Harry's shoulder) Mr. Jameson, you got me at a bad time. 
JAMESON (V.O.) I need pictures of your friend, the Amazing Spider-Man. But I need bad guy shots, you got it? Lots of bad guy shots. We're gonna pin that insect to the wall. Whaddaya say? 
PETER hangs up. The DIAL TONE cuts off JAMESON. 
INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Only he and the PHOTO ASSISTANT are there. 
JAMESON What about that kid? On the job already? 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 
OCK is pacing around the hot rodded room. He checks this and that. He looks at the COUNTDOWN CLOCK (06:00:10) and throws himself down in his CHAIR. He resumes his check- down. 
OCK Fusion cells...? All up. Internal temperature... okay. Risk? (a long beat) Acceptable. (another beat) Let's fly. 
He starts flicking on SWITCHES and DIALS. The WHINE whirs up. He throws the RED POWER THROTTLE. The POWER DIAL goes to 90! 
INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
PETER and HARRY are at a COMPUTER. The LIGHTS flicker and dim. Then they go back on. PETER and HARRY look at each other and shrug. 
HARRY Got something! 
INSERT: DIGITAL CLOCK display: "06:00:03"

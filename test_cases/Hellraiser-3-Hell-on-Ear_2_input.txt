Thick green jungle foliage obscures the view of a POV camera. 
The sounds of confused battle are heard OFF; helicopters, gun- fire, distant explosions, screams of the dying and the wounded 
Leaves and branches SMACK against the frame as the unseen dreamer rushes confusedly through the dense forest. 
The voices of the Soldiers - distant, echoed, repeated - are heard over the roar of battle. 
SOLDIER 1 (off) He's going.  He's going.  He's going ... 
SOLDIER 2 (off) We're losing him.  We're losing him. We're losing him ... 
The sound of their voices seems to prompt the POV camera to more furious endeavor. 
It turns rapidly left and right, forcing its way through the greenery until suddenly, with one last push through foliage thick enough to be a single bush, the view changes completely. 
EXT.  FLANDERS FIELD (WW I)   DAY      (JOEY'S DREAM) 
The POV camera (Joey) walks out into another battlefield, one of a different character. 
It appears to be early morning.  The skies are grey and overcast.  In the distance plumes of black smoke spiral upward 
No jungle, no trees or grass.  The ground is baked mud disfigured with deep trenches, re-inforced by wooden slats. 
The atmosphere is post-conflict; guns are silent, there are no cries or sound of machinery. 
Scattered around are corpses of many khaki-clad soldiers. 
Nothing moves.  No birds sing.  It is a horrible, desolate image from the bloody pages of history.  The fields of Flanders in World War One. 
A noise begins to be heard OFF.  A low angry BUZZING. 
ANGLE ON DEAD SOLDIER 
A cloud of buzzing flies are feeding on the flesh of his poor dead face. 
JOEY (off) Noooooooooo ....... 
The buzzing and Joey's anguished cry both CONTINUE OVER as we 
CUT TO 
INT.   JOEY'S BEDROOM   NIGHT 
Joey sitting up in bed, eyes wide, still screaming. 
JOEY Nooooooooooo! 
The cry cuts off abruptly as Joey realizes where she is. 
She catches her breath and then freezes as she realizes that the buzzing sound from her dream is present in her bedroom. Are the flies still feeding?  She glances around her room. 
ANGLE ON BEDROOM TV - JOEY'S POV 
Her TV set is on.  The buzzing sound comes from white noise. 
Joey is puzzled and scared. 
JOEY Is somebody here?  Is somebody here!? Terri ... ? 
She half gets out of bed and then stops, transfixed, as the TV screen's white noise is replaced by an image. 
ANGLE ON TV 
As in the editing suite, the image is grainy black-and-white. 
The buzzing continues, now joined by HISSING and WHISTLING that fades in and out as if unseen hands are trying to tune into an impossibly distant station. 
Somewhere in the sound-montage we can almost hear GHOSTLY VOICES whispering; "Joey, Joey, Joey ... " 
On the screen, an English Officer - Elliott - is sitting cross- legged on the floor of a Quonset hut. 
On the floor in front of him is something at which he stares - something that the image is not sharp enough to show. 
WIDER ANGLE - JOEY AND TV

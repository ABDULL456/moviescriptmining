FADE UP: 
INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Jean watches "The Little Rascals" on TV in the living room. The sound is turned off and a record player PLAYS Gypsy music loudly. 
Rolled up in a large drop cloth, Gina is asleep on the floor. Next to her, Jean works on all fours, drawing figures, crowns, and houses. 
Working feverishly, he writes "HEY, HEY, HEY" in big clusters, then writes other words: SHARK, IMMORTALITY, JOHN THE REVELATOR, FAME, INK, TEETH, HAWAII SUPERMARKET, POLE STAR, BABOON and TAR. 
He has an acoustics manual and Bible open    on the floor. He copies the technical blueprints from the manual.    He reads the Bible, following the text with a dirty finger. It    seems that he watches TV, draws, listens to the music and reads    at the same time. 
He mixes Liquitex paints and puts some colors on the drawings. He draws a long blue line and carries it over onto the floor. Up the wall. Through the fridge. Across the window. 
He takes off his paint-covered clothes and changes into Gina's black slip. He rummages around the room, gathering pieces of his and Gina's clothes. 
He spreads the clothes on the floor, and selecting wide brushes with long bristles, picks up the cans of Liquitex paint. 
When paint spills on the clothes, he spreads it into shapes. 
Gina wakes up. She reaches for one of the painted shirts. 
GINA (in disbelief) Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing? 
BASQUIAT C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now. 
GINA I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear? (she begins to cry) How could you do that to me? 
Jean wipes his hands off on his thighs and puts his arms around Gina, holding her. 
BASQUIAT ... I'll buy you some new ones. 
GINA 
You don't have any fucking money.. 
Jean lets her cry for a moment, then notices the music playing on the stereo - a Gypsy song sung in Spanish. 
BASQUIAT Do you know what he's saying? 
GINA What who's saying? 
BASQUIAT Manzanita.... (translating song) ... if one day I die, and    you read this piece of paper, I want you    to know how much I love you. Although I'll    never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your    hair, your hair, your face, your face' 
Gina looks up at him. 
BASQUIAT (CONT'D) 'Even though you were never mine And you never will be You have a piece of my heart You have, you have, you have...' (he reaches down, wiping off Gina's face) 'Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face.' 
No longer crying, Gina leans her head against Jean. 
We HEAR a CALL from the window: 
BENNY (O.S.) Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!! 
BASQUIAT (at the window) Come on in! 
CUT TO: 
Benny and two GUYS come barreling into the apartment. Immediate chaos. Benny holds up a packet of drugs and jiggles it temptingly. They make themselves at home. Jean sits with them and starts to chop up the drugs. 
Gina gives Jean a look. She stands, still wrapped in the drop cloth. She lets it fall to the floor. She's wearing only her underwear. She walks to the bedroom. Benny watches her. 
BASQUIAT Gina, don't you want any of this? You could use some. 
Gina doesn't respond. She comes out of the bedroom with a small suitcase. 
GINA See you later. 
She leaves. 
Silence. 
GUY #1 Nice underwear... 
They start to laugh. 
INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Kneeling on the floor,    Jean    covers the surface    of the refrigerator door with    fast,    rushing strokes.    He mixes paint in a large soupbowl and dips    his    hair in the bowl.    Pressing his head to the door, he paints    with    his hair. He stops    to examine the marks. 
He HITS his head against the door harder and harder.

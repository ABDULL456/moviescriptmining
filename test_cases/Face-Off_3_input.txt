Walton watches as Dubov throws Archer across the room. Archer staggers to his feet -- and sees the encircling inmates and guards looking at him -- unimpressed. 
Especially his "brother" Pollux -- who watches uncertainly. 
Dubov attacks again -- but Archer is ready.  He grabs Dubov's fist -- just before it hits his face. 
ARCHER Never -- in -- the -- face. 
Holding Dubov's fist firmly, Archer kicks Dubov repeatedly in the groin.  Metal boot meeting soft flesh. 
Dubov staggers back -- hurt.  Archer moves in for the kill, savoring it. 
Walton looks skyward. 
WALTON Lock 'em down. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
UP ABOVE - CENTRAL SECURITY 
The prison's nerve center -- with video-feeds and monitors designed to keep problems and privacy to a minimum. 
The two deputies react to Walton's call.  Identifying Archer and Dubov's signature-blips -- they throw the appropriate switches and... 
ZAP!  The magnetic boots lock both inmates to the floor. Dubov flails hopelessly -- but Archer's just out of reach. 
Crack!  Walton punches Archer in the diaphragm. 
ARCHER What?  He started it! 
Walton smashes Archer harder -- he hits the floor. 
ARCHER When I get out of here -- 
WALTON You'll what? 
ARCHER I'm going to have you fired. 
His statement is so ludicrous, Walton laughs.  Everyone does.  From the inmates' reactions, Archer knows he's been accepted. 
WALTON (to Dubov) That's two strikes, Dubov.  One more and you know where you're going. (to the others) Back to your 'suites' -- or no dinner. 
As Archer drops into the line of cons -- he spots Pollux waiting for him.  Girding himself for this first encounter -- he's got a plan. 
POLLUX Hey, bro... 
ARCHER -- Pollux? 
POLLUX Of course it's Pollux, what the fuck's wrong with you? 
Archer stares -- feigning confusion until Walton prods him forward.  Pollux watches his "brother" go -- very concerned. 
INT. ARCHER'S CELL - NIGHT 
Archer lies on his cot -- staring at the ceiling. Isolated, lonely, he realizes how easy it would be to go insane here. 
EXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - NIGHT 
An insanely starry night.  Van Gogh's night.  The night he cut off his ear, anyway. 
INT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT 
Castor's body lies inert.  His life-support MACHINES BLIPPING away.  Until the EEG spikes.  Once -- twice -- three times.  Brain wave activity increases -- and stabilizes. 
Castor's fingers twitch.  Then his fist clenches -- hard. Castor's head is swathed in gauze.  But his eyes pop open. 
Reflexively, Castor wrenches from the bed -- tearing out the tubes and wires that tether him to life support.  He goes down -- in agony -- groaning. 
He struggles to his feet -- staggering through the lab -- until he catches the reflection of his bandaged face in the window.  He quickly unwraps the gauze. 
The discarded bandages fall at his feet... we don't see what CASTOR sees -- but we hear him MOAN... then CHOKE... then SCREAM -- the only moment Castor ever loses his cool. 
Finally composing himself -- Castor's hand grips the phone and he dials. 
CASTOR Lars... okay, Lunt, then. (rifling desk documents) Something really fucked-up happened... I'm in trouble... so listen very carefully... 
EXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - NIGHT (LATER) 
A RANGE ROVER SCREECHES up.  At gunpoint, Lars and Lunt manhandle Hoag into the lab. 
INT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT 
Lars and Lunt hustle Hoag in.  The lab is on.  The screens run -- scrolling through the video log of Archer's surgery. 
Hoag sees his terrified assistants -- bound with duct tape. 
HOAG What's this about?  What do you want? 
Lars shoves Hoag into a towering figure... we ZOOM IN ON Hoag's glasses.  And THROUGH the REFLECTION we see...

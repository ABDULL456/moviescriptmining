LISA Sounds ominous. 
DELANEY You could say that. It's where Category A patients are held. The criminally insane. 
LISA Really? Doctor Mixter didn't mention that. 
DELANEY Yes, well, these patients are beyond help so they've become athe hospital's secret. Many of them were transferred from prisons and other institutions. Doctor Mixter probably thought he could help them. He can't. The staff call this place Blood Row. 
Delaney opens the door. 
CUT TO: 
22.INT. STAIRCASE ­ CONTINUOUS 
Lisa follows Delaney down a winding staircase. As they descend down the steps, the light fades. 
CUT TO: 
23.INT. WARD X ­ CONTINUOUS 
Delaney and Lisa enter a long dark corridor with a row of thick metal doors either side. Two light bulbs hang from the ceiling at each end of the corridor, providing only minimal illumination. Lisa's nose twitches. 
LISA What's that smell? 
DELANEY It always hangs in the air. No matter how much we bleach the floor there is always that smell of death. 
Lisa looks concerned. 
LISA These patients are dangerous? 
DELANEY Yes. But don't worry, we never have to interact directly or anything like that. You will just be mopping the corridor and dusting. 
Delaney walks over to the first door on the right. There is a hatch on the door. Delaney slowly slides it open and beckons Lisa over. She peers inside. The cell is very basic, white walls with the only furniture being an uncomfortable looking bed and a toilet without a seat. There are thick iron bars on one small window. A skinny man in his thirties sits on a basic bed in a white vest, rocking back and forth. He has wild hair and a scraggly beard. 
DELANEY That's Jerry Kimble. He was convicted of stabbing a young mother forty-nine times in front of her two year-old son, then killing and sexually assaulting a woman before smothering her four-year-old daughter. They call him the Green Chain Rapist. He was in Sing Sing but was certified insane and his lawyer got him transferred here. He doesn't make any noise or fuss, but he is a dangerous man. Especially towards women. This next inmate is even worse. Delaney slides the hatch shut and walks over to the next door. He slowly slides open the hatch and Lisa peers inside. Another basic white cell with only a bed and toilet. A man stands in the centre of the room with his hands behind his back. His hair is slicked back, as jet black as the eyes that stare at Lisa. He smiles. Delaney slides the hatch shut. DELANEY That's Dennis Palmer. Also known as The Long Island Cannibal. He was abused as a child so his targets were always paedophiles and rapists. He'd track them down and torture them. He would eat parts of their body while they were still alive. 
LISA That's horrible. 
DELANEY The most horrible thing is that a lot of the public thought he was a hero. 
Delaney walks over to a door on the opposite side of the hallway. He slides open the hatch. 
DELANEY Sadie Krenwinkel. 
Lisa looks inside. Inside the basic cell a woman sits cross legged on her bed. She has long flowing black hair, intense eyes and a pentagram carved into her forehead. She looks up and smiles at Lisa. Delaney slides the hatch shut. 
LISA What's her deal? 
DELANEY She was a member of a Witchcraft cult. They kidnapped six people for a demonic ritual. Five were killed but one got away and led police to the cult. She turned her trial into a circus, talking about lots of crazy stuff. The media enjoyed it but she got certified insane by the court. She's been around a few institutions since. Now she's here. 
LISA Some strange stories here. 
DELANEY Well those aren't the strangest.

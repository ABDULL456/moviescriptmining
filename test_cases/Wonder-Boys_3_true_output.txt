Grady, laboring badly on his ankle", enters and finds a DUFFEL BAG open on the floor, its contents a tangle of quickly-packed clothes. Everything else in the room feels of another time. PHOTOGRAPHS are everywhere, documenting a PRETTY GIRL'S life, from first recital to cap and gown. 
One photograph lies face down. GRADY turns it over and finds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman, standing in a white gown next to a younger Grady--on their wedding day. 
61	INT. DEN 
James enters, FRENCH ROLL in hand, and sees a REMOTE CONTROL atop the BAR. Taking it, he points it at the WIDE- SCREEN TELEVISION imbedded in the opposite wall and, seconds later, GEORGE SANDERS walks into his CLOSE-UP. 
GEORGE SANDERS There's no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral... 
62	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Grady, a PINK PRINCESS PHONE to his ear, lies on the bed next to a huge TEDDY BEAR. 
GRADY (into phone) Yes, I' m looking for the Chancellor... I don't know. She should be in the main hall ...Thank you. 
63	INT. DEN 
James runs through the channels, pauses on MARTIN MILNER and GEORGE MAHARIS, riding in their curvy Corvette. 
64	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
A Nelson Riddle's THEME FROM ROUTE 66 BOOMS from below, GRADY cups a hand over his ear. 
GRADY Sara? Hi. It's Grady. 
SARA'S VOICE Where are you, Grady? An elevator? 
GRADY I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about... 
SARA'S VOICE (evenly) You're in Kinship? 
GRADY Yes. But that's not why I called... 
SARA'S VOICE With Emily? 
GRADY What? No'. There's no one here. I'm just ...just.... 
SARA'S VOICE Just what? Doing a little dusting? 
As GRADY endeavors to respond, TWO YOUTHFUL VOICES, CHEERFULLY SINGING, rise from below. 
CHEERFUL VOICES Good Morning! Good Morning! 
GRADY (yelling) James! For Christ sake, will you turn that thing down! 
SARA'S VOICE James? He's still with you? 
65	INT. DEN 
James, in the midst of pouring himself a tumbler of Bushmills, smiles as JUDY GARLAND and MICKEY ROONEY sing their hearts out in Babes In Arms. 
JUDY/MICKEY We talked the whole night through! 
66	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 
GRADY shakes his head, carries the phone toward the bedroom WINDOW. 
GRADY Look, Sara. ..I'm not here. ..I'm not here to 
As GRADY watches, a late-model PONTIAC BONNEVIlLE turns into the driveway below him. 
GRADY (cont'd) ...reconcile with Emily. 
SARA'S VOICE Are you there to not reconcile with her? 
The Bonneville's trunk pops open, revealing THREE BAGS OF GROCERIES, and HANK and IRENE WINTERS, both in their 60's, get out. An enormous NEWFOUNDLAND vaults from the backseat. 
Sara, eating phone static this whole time, interprets Grady's silence her own way. 
SARA'S VOICE (cont'd) Goodbye, Grady. 
GRADY No. Sara, you don't understand... 
SARA'S VOICE Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady. 
GRADY (dreading it) Yea? 
SARA'S VOICE How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else. 
As the line goes dead, GRADY watches Hank and Irene Winters disappear below him. 
69	INT. DEN       69 
James--Irish whiskey in one hand, the pride of Humboldt County in the other--watches with deep absorption as Judy and Mickey have a heartfelt conversation. Then, sensing something ...he turns. 
Hank and Irene Winters, grocery bags in arm, stand frozen. 
JAMES LEER Hullo. 
FOOTSTEPS are HEARD on the staircase and GRADY hobbies into view. He tries a smile.

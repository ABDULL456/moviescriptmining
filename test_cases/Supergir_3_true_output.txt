Inside the translator's booth, the entire panorama of the enormous hall is visible through the glass window. The eight TRANSLATORS stop translating and stare at the scene below. 
BACK TO GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
Selena is about to speak in the microphone, when two SECURITY GQUARDS attempt to step onto the podium. Selena reaches out toward them. A field of force from her hands stops them in their tracks, knocking them backwards off the steps to land on their butts. The delegates gasp at this act of magical violence. 
SELENA Nations of the world! I bring you tidings of a new age! 
The President of the General Assembly starts to shout at her and bang on the podium with his gavel. Selena looks over her shoulder with mild annoyance. Instantly the President's gavel turns into a live eel. The President drops it with horror. Selena continues her speech. 
SELENA I bring you a return to the ancient true worship of Nature, our Sovereign Queen and Mother. And I bring you myself as her representative here on Earth. 
The URITANIAN suddenly recovers his wits and tries to place a hand on Selena's shoulder. A whirlwind hurls him off the podium into the desks of the front row delegates. The delegates babble in consternation but keep to their seats. Selena raises her voice to be heard over the uproar. 
SELENA From this moment forth, all science, religion and other unnatural beliefs are forbidden. And in their place I will teach the One True Way of our ancient grandmothers. 
The President of the General Assembly has recovered enough from the surprise of the eel to interrupt Selena. 
PRESIDENT You are talking about the end of Civilisation as we know it. 
SELENA And it's about time too. 
PRESIDENT I do not know who you are, or what evil force you represent, but it will take more than a few threats from you to make mankind turn back the clock and abandon thousands of years of progress. 
Selena has listened with a mocking smile as he speaks. He finishes to a smattering of applause from some of the delegates. 
SELENA Threats? I don't need threats to destroy civilisation. I have something better. 
She snaps her fingers in the air. Immediately a RAIN OF MONEY BEGINS TO FALL ALL OVER THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. PAPER MONEY AND COINS OF ALL NATIONS. Selena looks at her work with pleasure. Then she disappears in a FLASH OF LIGHT. 
The delegates blink with astonishment. The only trace of her presence is the tang of sulfur in the air---and the money. One delegate forgets his dignity and starts scooping up money from his desk and stuffing it into his pockets. Suddenly all the delegates are doing the same thing. The only exception is the delegate from the United Kingdom who thinks it might be beneath his dignity, and looks about with mild disapproval. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE PHANTOM ZONE 
Supergirl walks across the rolling monotony of the Phantom Zone. We have never seen her like this before: sweating, her hair unkempt, streaks of dirt and grit on her face, exhausted and full of despair. She stumbles at the crest of a low ridge and falls down to the bottom of the slope, banging her head on a rock. She sits there, a big rip in her ,uniform, rubbing her bruised forehead. It is hard to imagine her any worse off. 
She hears a sound, vaguely familiar. She looks around for its source. She follows the sound, crawling slowly along the base of the ridge. The sound gets louder and as she, approaches. It is a sound of celestial, spiritual beauty: the music of the spheres. 
Suddenly she comes out into a tiny valley in the Phantom Zone and sees before her the most beautiful sight she could imagine. The harsh monochromatic sterility of the Phantom Zone gives way to a riot of bright colours. A dome-like building protrudes from the ground. All around it are gorgeous singing sculptures in the style of Argo City. A sculptor. in the clothing of Argo City is modeling a glassy statue with a matterwand. He turns and catches sight of Supergirl. It is Zaltar. 
SUPERGIRL Zaltar. 
Zaltar drops his wand and comes running over to Supergirl. He kneels beside her on the sandy ground. 
ZALTAR Kara? Is it you? 
Supergirl nods. She is obviously exhausted. Zaltar takes the bulb full of liquid off his belt and offers her a drink. She drinks thirstily of the refreshing green liquid, and feels strength returning to her body. 
SUPERGIRL What is this place? 
ZALTAR This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City? 
SUPERGIRL I was on Earth... 
ZALTAR Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself? 
SUPERGIRL Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source... 
ZALTAR Shouldnt've done that. 
SUPERGIRL ...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone. 
ZALTAR It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces--- 
SUPERGIRL I know. 
ZALTAR Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people. 
He helps her to her feet and over to his house, a sort of Argonian gothic cathedral half-buried in the sand. The curves of the arches and the materials are strongly reminiscent of Zaltar's work on Argo City. 
SUPERGIRL Others? 
ZALTAR Criminals. 
Zaltar gestures vaguely to the horizon on his right.

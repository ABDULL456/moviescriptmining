CRANE Wow, you're a really good cook. 
MANTIS I wish my mouth was bigger. 
The others laugh. But not Tigress. 
MONKEY Tigress, you gotta try this. 
Tigress looks up from her meal. 
TIGRESS It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months at a time on nothing but the dew of a single gingko leaf and the energy of the universe. 
On the others for a beat. Then Po shrugs. 
PO I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna need a lot more than dew. And, uh, universe juice. 
Po laughs. He picks up his bowl and takes a giant gulp. When he lowers the bowl, we see a noodle hanging from his face -- it looks like a moustache. Mantis snickers. 
PO (CONT'D) What? 
MANTIS Oh, nothing... Master Shifu! 
The rest start laughing. Po realizes he's wearing a noodle moustache. He plays it up. 
PO (imitating Shifu) You will never be the Dragon Warrior, unless you lose five hundred pounds and brush your teeth! 
The Five LAUGH. 
PO (CONT'D) (imitating Shifu) What is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it! 
The Five keep LAUGHING. Po reaches over and grabs two empty bowls and holds them up like ears. 
PO (CONT'D) (imitating Shifu) Work hard, Panda. And maybe, someday... you will have ears like mine. 
As the rest of the Five laugh, Tigress sneaks a moment to smell Po's soup. Leaning towards the bowl, she suddenly looks up and stops. The Five also look up and stop laughing. 
Reveal Shifu has entered behind Po. He is holding Oogway's staff. 
PO (CONT'D) (normal) Ears. It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good. 
Po looks at the stone-faced Five. Tigress jumps to her feet. 
MONKEY It's Shifu. 
PO Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing? 
He finally notices Shifu standing there, doing a slow burn. Embarrassed, he places the soup bowls on his chest like a bra. 
PO (CONT'D) Ooh! Master Shifu! 
Po slurps up the noodle moustache. Monkey can't help but snicker. 
SHIFU You think this is funny? Tai Lung has escaped from prison and you're acting like children! 
PO What? 
SHIFU He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him. 
The bowls fall off. A beat as this sinks in... then Po starts to laugh. 
PO And here I am saying you got no sense of humor. I'm gonna stop Tai... 
Shifu just stares at him, deadly serious.

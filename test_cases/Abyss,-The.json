The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands? \nLINDSEY He's got the shakes? \nBUD Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.

Eternal night. \nANGLE FROM OUTSIDE.  Coffey's face in the window.  Stuck to the acrylic bubble beside him is one of those Garfields, suction cups on its paws.  Coffey stares out.

In the mess hall, Catfish and Bud are crashed out on the tables, wrapped in blankets.  The cold has gotten intense.  Water drips.  The walls sweat with condensation.  Lindsey can see her breath as she makes coffee.  She carries a cup over to Monk, who is a face in a pile of blankets.  A hand comes out, takes the coffee. \nMONK Thanks. \nLindsey sips hers, staring.  Her thoughts are far away... in the bottomless pit.  She is leaning up against the table where Bud is sleeping.  His soft snoring downshifts into a loud rasp.  Lindsey touches him gently on the shoulder. \nLINDSEY Virgil, turn on your side. \nBud grunts and turns without waking, an automatic response.

Hey, I told you to wipe that grin off your face. \nHe yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor door.  Switches off the lights.  Goes out. \nQuiet lapping of water in the moonpool.  A beat.  Then... \nA cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening, sending shadows shifting across the top of the chamber.  The surface begins to pulsate. \nSuddenly, the water itself rises, forming itself into a shifting, shimmering pseudopod as big around as a man's body.  The transparent form pulses... an amoebic mass shivering in the air. \nIt stretches, becoming a more refined form.  Like a blindly probing glass python, it elongates and weaves across the room.  It extends and extends, stretching out from the moonpool, a shimmering tentacle.  The 'head' or tip, a featureless liquid bulb, seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward, as if it can see where it's going. \nINT.

Lindsey has even fallen asleep in her chair, her head buried in her arms on the table.  The shimmering tentacle enters the room in total silence.  It sways gracefully in to air, searching. It undulates across the room, hanging about five feet in the air, surveying everything.  It moves past Lindsey.  Sensing something, she lifts her head, turning... sees the apparition next to her. \nHer eyes go wide.  Amazement, but not fear.  The tentacle is moving on, still searching.  Lindsey shakes Bud awake, clapping her hand over his mouth. \nBud blinks twice, then freezes.  When she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging open like a total goon. \nBud chucks his pillow are Catfish, on the next table. \nCatfish cracks one eye open.  Turns away.  Turns right back... both eyes open now.  Sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them.  It seems to recognize Lindsey.  It doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to her.  She holds her ground, fascinated. \nThe bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face... her face.  It is water, still clear and undulating... but definitely Lindsey.  She gasps in surprise. The liquid-Lindsey gasps soundlessly... a perfect mimic of her expression. Lindsey laughs involuntarily.  It laughs... without sound.  Lindsey makes a face, sticking out her tongue... testing it. \nThe liquid-Lindsey does the same.  Bud has just had the rug jerked out from under his sense of what is possible and what isn't, but he's taking it pretty will, considering. \nBUD (whispering) I think it likes you. \nLINDSEY It's trying to communicate. \nHer liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of Bud's. \nShe reaches out her hand slowly.  Gingerly, her fingers touch the surface. Ripples extend outward from the contact, across Bud's features. \nHer fingertips break effortlessly through the surface, just like she's dipping her hand into a bowl of water, except sideways.  She draws her wet fingers out and studies them, amazed.  Touches one fingertip to her tongue. \nLINDSEY Seawater. \nThe pseudopod pulls back from her.  It loops in the air dramatically, full circle... and ties itself into a knot.  As the knot tightens down, it melts back into the body.  The 'disappearing knot' trick. \nLindsey laughs, grinning with the open wonder and delight of a child at a magic show.  She is transported. \nLINDSEY Show off. \nShe looks at Bud.  He grins broadly.

In a flash of insight, he runs to the big sliding door through which the pseudopod stretches into the corridor.  He and Schoenick heave on the door.  Like a guillotine blade it slices effortlessly through it. \nVARIOUS ANGLES -- CORRIDORS, MESS HALL, LADDERWELL, MAINTENANCE... as the body of the pseudopod collapses, splashing on the floor.  It reverts to nothing more than a long puddle of simple seawater.  As the tendrils dissolve, the warhead slams back down onto the cart, unharmed.

Don't poke at the rattler. \nBUD You done impressing yourself, ace? \nONE NIGHT No way that could just be seawater. \nLINDSEY They must've learned how to control water...

The shape extends beyond the limits of visibility. Towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface.  It dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it, approaching an opening that soon yawns like a vast mouth. \nThey are picking up speed, swept along by a powerful current, into the mouth- like opening. \nINT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE                                                   224 \nBud stares around in awe as smooth, pearlescent walls blur past him.  It is a curving three-dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system, where controlled currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional space.  Tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main-routes hundreds of feet across, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur. \nINT. FINAL CHAMBER                                                      225 \nEntering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor, and the NTI moves back a few feet. \nA shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the chamber.  The seawater divides, like the Red Sea, into two rippling walls. They move apart.  Leaving Bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway. \nWeakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free.  Drops to his knees. Doubles over as spasms wrack him.  Breathing fluid explodes from his lungs. He lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what he can only hope is air.  It is. \nBud slowly recovers, sitting up.  His head is clearing.  This really is happening.  Beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the NTI being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven is gathered watching him. \nBUD Howdy, Uuuh... how you guys doin'? \nHis voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber.  Soft laps of water from the 'walls'. \nIn the air a pattern of glowing lines appears, a series of what appears to be circuit diagrams.  Bud staggers back from this strange 'screen' hanging in mid-air.  The image is about twenty feet across. \nThere is a rolling jumble of static and interference which resolves into... the face of Dan Rather, doing the evening news.  STATIC, then another newscast.  And another.  Fragments of the same story.  The world on the brink of war. \nBUD You watch out TV?  That what you're trying to say?  That you know what's been going on up there? \nThe NTIs are impassive.  Static... then another newscast. \nThis time, we're allowed to focus on the story.  An on-the-scene interview outside a high-tech seismology lab.  There is an air of hysteria about the scene... technicians running across the background of the shot, people shouting, the reporter jamming his mike at the harried-looking scientist. \nREPORTER ... a Caltech scientist who is among those reporting an unprecedented disturbance in the world's oceans.  Dr. Breg, can you give us a clearer explanation then we're getting? \nBerg is edgy and distracted.  People keeps handing him pieces of paper, computer hardcopy.  The biggest thing in his life is happening... \nBERG They're acoustic shockwaves, like tsunamis, but with no seismological source.  The waves are propagating toward the shorelines of every continent-- \nAn assistant runs up, face shiny with fear, beckoning.  We see that Berg is running scared.  The impossible bringing the greatest terror to the rational mind. \nBERG Yeah.  I'll be right there... I have to go. Look, we don't know what it is!  Okay?  Not the slightest goddamn idea! \nThe image dissolves into static, fades out.  Bud turns to the NTIs. \n", "test3_true": "Static again, then a brilliant flash.  Grainy stock film of a hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific. \nThe film repeats, and then again, faster, and again until is merges into an unbroken white glare.  Bud gets the message. \nBUD Hey, you don't know they're really gonna do it. Where do you get off passing judgment on us, when you can't be sure?  How do you know? \nThe screen exploded into a staccato series of searing images, stark moments from recent history... \nUS soldiers fighting in Vietnam, street warfare in Beirut, a car bomb in Belfast, a suspect shot in the head in the streets of Saigon, burned and bleeding children, grainy footage of corpses bulldozed into mass graves at Auschwitz, Wermacht soldiers marching in goose-step review, a 13-year-old contra with an AK-47...  Just glimpses, strobing... a few frames of each. But enough.  The images continue. \nHOLD ON BUD, as the lights flicker on his face, the ongoing indictment of humanity. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. OCEAN FRONT WALK, SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA -- DAY                  226 \nA video news crew leaps from a Jet Ranger helicopter in a parking area and runs to set up near the railing, facing the ocean.  Pandemonium reigns around them, people running, driving, evacuating inland. \nOn the horizon, out to sea, a dark line has appeared. \nIt grows in height as it comes closer, a wall of water stretching across the horizon, already hundreds of feet high and growing. \nEXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    227 \nLONG LENSE SHOT, looking seaward past the Statue of Liberty, out past the Verazzano Narrows.  Stacked up by perspective, the distant wave is a wall of water impossibly high, still miles out. \nEXT. NAVAL BASE, KAMCHATKA PENINSULA, U.S.S.R. -- NIGHT                 228 \nThe scene repeats on the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Penninsula in Russia, where a full moon shimmers along the crest of a vast wave. \nSIRENS wail as Russian sailors run from the docks of Petropavlovsk Naval Base. Some stand rooted as the black glacier of water, a thousand feet high and growing, thunders toward them in nightmarish slow motion. \nEXT. OCEAN FRONT, SANTA MONICA -- DAY                                   229 \nThe minicam crew reporter is speaking rapidly, faltering with emotion, his voice cracking like the famous broadcast from the scene of the Hindenburg disaster. \nREPORTER The horizon has gone dark... the crowd is starting to run... some are just staring, unable to move... the wave... the wave is... it's... I don't know... maybe a thousand feet high already... getting bigger as I'm watching... still miles out... oh my God, Jesus... I can hear it... \nA roar fills the air, a thunder which drowns out the people's screams, even the rotors of the news chopper as the camera teams scrambles aboard.  They leave the announcer standing transfixed, his face blank, eyes tracking upward and upward as the ground begins to shake. \nEXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    230 \nThe Statue of Liberty looks like a souvenir figurine at the afternoon sun is blocked out by the cresting tsunami, an escarpment of water 2500 feet tall. \nEXT. SAN FRANSISCO -- DAY                                               231 \nLONG LENS SHOT -- The Golden Gate Bridge and the hills of the city, the buildings downtown.  Beyond, FILLING FRAME is the wall of sea green which defies our comprehension.  The image shakes with the THUNDER. \nEXT. MALIBU -- DAY                                                      232 \nA diehard surfer looks over his shoulder as the mountain of water which transcends his worst nightmare.  He lies paralyzed on his board. \nEXT. MIAMI -- DAY                                                       233 \nDowntown Miami crouches in terror at the feet of the shimmering monolith. \nIn a penthouse office suite, an executive watches the wave towering above him, blocking out the sun, a line of raging foam appearing as it arches over, about to break upon the teeming city. \nAnd then... \nThe wave slows as it crests... \nAnd stops. \nIT SIMPLY STOPS. \n2600 feet high and motionless except for a shimmering undulation of its surface in the bright sun.  There is quiet, a faint wind and calling of confused gulls.  Various reactions, as the thunder fades and people recover, only to stand awed before the vast, inexplicable manifestation.  A news helicopter passes in front of it like a dragonfly. \nEXT. MALIBU                                                             234 \nThe surfer just blinks, starting. \nEXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    235 \nOn the East Coast it's the same, as the World Trade Centers are dwarfed by a shimmering blue wall which stands... waiting. \nEXT. PETROPAVLOVSK NAVAL BASE, U.S.S.R. -- NIGHT                        236 \nRussian seamen, lining the harbor breakwall at Petropavlovsk Naval Base on the Kamchatka Peninsula, stare upward at the monolith of water, undulating in the moonlight.  It seems poised to crash down, inflicting inconceivable devastation... but it doesn't. \nEXT. OCEAN FRONT WALK, SANTA MONICA                                     237 \nWhen all have seen... \nThe wave soundlessly subsides, slowly slipping back and down until the surface of the sea is normal again. \nVIDEO SHOT, HANDHELD, of a crowd of people watching the sea.  Moving from face to face.  Various reactions as people respond to what they can only understand as a miracle.  The faces... awed, stunned, tear-streaked... laughing.  The cameraman is just walking.  Some people turn to him and smile, or laugh, or whoop. \n", "test3_id": 2756}

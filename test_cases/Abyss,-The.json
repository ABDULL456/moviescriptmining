OCEAN/UNDERWATER -- DAY                                            3 \nBlue, deep and featureless, the twilight of five hundred feet down. PROPELLER SOUND.  Materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but sleek form of an Ohio-class SSBN ballistic missile submarine. \nINT. U.S.S. MONTANA -- DAY                                              4 \nIn the attack center, darkened to womb-red, the crew's faces shine with sweat in the glow of their instruments.  The SKIPPER and his EXEC crowd around BARNES, the sonarman. \nCAPTAIN Sixty knots?  No way, Barnes... the reds don't have anything that fast. \nBARNES Checked it twice, skipper.  It's a real unique signature.  No cavitation, no reactor noise... doesn't even sound like screws. \nHe puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to the intruder's acoustic signature, a strange THRUMMING.  The captain studies the electronic position board, a graphic representation of the contours of the steep-walled canyon, a symbol for the Montana, and converging with it, an amorphous trace, representing the bogey. \nCAPTAIN What the hell is it? \nEXEC I'll tell you what it's not, it's not one of ours. \nBARNES Sir!  Contact changing heading to two-one-four, diving.  Speed eighty knots!  Eighty knots! \nEXEC Eighty knots... \nBARNES Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet. \nFRANK (simultaneously) Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet. \nTension builds in the attack room as the Montana surges to intercept the intruder.  The exec tensely watches the vector-graphic readout for the side- scan sonar array.  The sub is running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls. \nEXEC (low, to Captain) It's getting tight in here. \nCAPTAIN We can still give him a haircut.  Helm, come right to oh six niner, down five degrees. \nHELMSMAN Coming right to oh six niner, sir.  Down five degrees. \nNAVIGATOR Port side clearance one hundred twenty feet narrowing to seventy-five.  Sir, we have a proximity warning light. \nEXEC That's too damn close!  We've gotta back off. \nBARNES Range to contact, two hundred.  Contact junked to bearing two six oh and accelerated to... one hundred thirty knots, sir! \nEXEC (really freaked now) Nothing goes one thirty! \nSuddenly the control room lights dim almost to blackness. \nEXT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     5 \nWe see only the effect, not the source, as a large diffuse light passes rapidly under the sub's hull.  Moments later a shockwave, like an underwater sonic boom, impacts the sub, slamming it sideways. \nINT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     6 \nThe bride crew are knocked off their feet, as the ship is buffeted. \nEXEC Turbulence!  We're in its wake! \nSIRENS.  Everyone shouting at once.  The power flickers low. \nCAPTAIN Helm, all stop!  Full right rudder! \nHELMSMAN All stop.  Full right rudder.  Hydraulic failure. Planes are not responding, sir! \nPower returns in time for the sonarman to get a glimpse at the side-scan display... AS THE SHEER CLIFF WALL LOOM BEFORE THEM. \nHELMSMAN Hydraulics restored, sir. \nEXT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     7 \nThe cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the port bow with nightmarish slow-motion.  The sub slams into it with horrific force, scraping along and bouncing off.  One tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw prangs the wall with an earsplitting K-K-KWANG! \nINT. PORT TO TORPEDO ROOM                                               8 \nWith the outer tube-doors torn off, seawater slams in, busting the inner hatches.  Two-foot thick columns of water, like fire-hoses of the gods, blast into the room.  Everything vanishes instantly in white spray. \nINT. CONTROL RM/ATTACK CENTER                                           9 \nCATFISH (Kentucky drawl) That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss. \nOMITTED                                                                 19 \nINT. DRILL ROOM                                                         20 \nBud turns from the window and crosses the drill floor.  The working heart of the rig.  THUNDEROUS MECHANICAL ROAR.  The drill crew, in hardhats and mud- plastered overalls, tend the massive spinning turn-table in the center of the chamber.  The semi-automated system requires only five men to operate.  The others are LUPTON MCWHIRTER, DWIGHT PERRY, JAMMER WILLIS, and TOMMY RAY DIETZ.  Bud hears his names called above the din by Jammer, a massive roughneck/diver who stands a good head taller than the rest. \nJAMMER (yelling) Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man. \nBUD Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry! \nOne of the roustabouts, a wiry Texan, turns to him. \nBUD Do me a favor and square away the mud hose and those cable slings.  This place is starting to look like my apartment. \nPerry chuckles and sets to the task cheerfully.  Bud EXITS, ducking his head through a low watertight hatch. \nINT. CORRIDOR/TOOLPUSHER'S OFFICE                                       21 \nBud tromps down the narrow corridor, his work boots gonging on steel. \nP.A. (HIPPY'S VOICE) BUD, PICK UP THE TOPSIDE LINE URGENT. \nBUD I'm coming.  Keep your pantyhose on. \nHe enters his office, a tiny cubicle with stacks of paperwork, dust- gathering tech manuals and waterstained Penthouse fold-outs.  He picks up the phone... punches down a line. \nBUD Brigman here.  Kirkhill?  What's going on? (pause) I am calm.  I'm a calm person.  Is there some reason why I shouldn't be calm? \nHOLD ON Bud's expression, darkening, as he listens. \nINT. CORRIDOR/CONTROL MODULE                                            22 \nThe control module is a long narrow cabin like the inside of a Winnebago, packed with instrumentation.  At the end is a small bay with multiple viewports.  Outside, at a 'Christmas tree' pipe installation, a lone diver can be seen welding.  He is accompanied by a large submersible, FLATBED, and by a Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, call LITTLE GEEK.  Little Geek is an underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable-like control TETHER. It has a single video 'eye' in front, by which the operator pilots the little machine.  The rig's ROV pilots is ALLEN 'HIPPY' CARNES, who stands by the window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee.  His pet white rat, BEANY, crawls contentedly around his shoulders.  The door BANGS OPEN. \nHippy jumps, slops his coffee.  Bud strides in.  Not calm. \nBUD Son of a bitch. \nHe kicks a chair out of the way and slams his palm down on a switch marked DIVER RECALL.  A SIREN, blasting through the water from a big hydrophone loudspeaker. \nBUD All divers.  Drop what you're doing.  Everybody out of the pool. \nEXT. DEEPCORE/CHRISTMAS TREE                                            A22 \nFlatbed's pilot, LISA 'ONE NIGHT' STANDING, can be clearly seen behind a bubble canopy.  She is a no-nonsense lady who holds her own in the mostly male environment by being one of the best submersible drivers in the business.  She controls a hydraulic manipulator arm, assisting the diver, ARLISS 'SONNY' DAWSON, in his work.  Little Geek hovers around them like a tiny helicopter.  One Night moves the Flatbed arm to Sonny and hands him the pipe. \nONE NIGHT Here you go, hon'. \nSONNY Just in time, sugar. \nThey react to Bud's recall, looking toward him up in the control module. \nONE NIGHT Dammit, we just got out here. \nSONNY There was a time when I would have asked why. \nOne Night makes a grab for his butt with the manipulator claw, which he narrowly avoids. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER SUB-BAY                                             23 \nFlatbed moves underneath the rig, a few feet above the seafloor, with Sonny riding on its top deck.  It passes under a lit opening and rises toward the surface of the water in the chamber above.  Little Geek follows like an obedient dog. \nINT. SUB-BAY/MOONPOOL                                                   24 \nThe opening is called the moonpool, and Deepcore's submersibles are launched through it.  From inside the sub-bay it looks just like a swimming pool. Flatbed surfaces, nearly filling it.  The chamber also contains CAB ONE, a similar submersible.  Jammer, Perry, and some of the other drill-room boys are helping the divers out of the water.  The water at this depth is only about six degrees above freezing, and these folks are cold and prune- fingered.  Finler pulls off his demand-helmet, revealing a round, boyish face. \nFINLER What's goin' on?  How come we got recalled? \nSONNY Hell is I know. \nOne Night jumps 'ashore' from Flatbed's broad deck and joins them.  Catfish is unzipping his bulky dry-suit. \nCATFISH Just follow standard procedure, will ya... flog the dog till somebody tells us what's happening. \nJAMMER Hey, Catfish, I'll sell you my October Penthouse for twenty bucks. \nONE NIGHT Save you money, darlin'... the pages are all stuck together by now. \nBud enters, approaching the group. \nJAMMER What's goin' on, Boss? \nBUD Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig. \nSONNY She-hit. \nMcBride appears on the bridge monitor, holding a sheet of weather-fax. \nMCBRIDE (on screen) Well, it's official, sportsfans.  They're calling it Hurricane Frederick, and it's going to be making our lives real interesting in a few hours. \nINT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                             32 \nBud responds via video. \nBUD Fred, huh?  I don't know.  Hurricanes should be named after women. \nMcBride looks up as the bridge door opens.  Lindsey enters in a blast of wind, wet as a wharf rat and twice as pissed off.  Maybe Bud is right. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            33 \nBud is surprised to see Lindsey's face appear on the monitor screen. \nLINDSEY I can't believe you let them do this! \nBUD (unpreturbed, almost cheerful) Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston. \nLINDSEY I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud? \nBUD Wasn't up to me. \nLINDSEY We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig! \nBUD Your rig? \nLINDSEY My rig.  I designed the damn thing. \nBUD Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me. \nLINDSEY You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap-- \nBUD I'm switching off now. \nLINDSEY Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You-- \nBud hits the switch and the screen goes dead. \nBUD Bye. \nHippy looks over him, trying very hard not to crack up. \nHIPPY Virgil? \nBUD God, I hate that bitch. \nHIPPY Yeah, well you never should have married her then. \nBud nods fatalistically. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EXPLORER DECK/LAUNCH WELL                                          34 \nTen foot waves crash through the launch-well, sending up geysers of spray. Next to the launch-well, crewman have attached a lifting cable to CAB THREE, eighteen feet of ugly yellow submersible.  It slams violently in its steel cradle as the drill-ship rolls.  Coffey and Schoenick hand the gear bags in to Wilhite and Monk though the hatch under the rear of the submersible. \nLindsey approaches, wearing a borrowed roustabout's coverall. \nShe looks down at the larger of the two equipment cases brought by the SEALs, lying on the deck.  Stenciled on it are the words: F.B.S./DEEP SUIT/MARK IV. Coffey and Schoenick push past her to pick it up. \nLINDSEY Let's go, gentlemen!  We either launch now or we don't launch. \nCoffey looks up in surprise as she nimbly climbs the side of Cab Three and grabs the lifting shackle, circling her raised hand to signal the crane man. \nLINDSEY Take her up, Byron! \nCab Three, with Lindsey riding its back, is pulled up out its cradle and starts to swing violently as Explorer pitches.  The submersible is then swung out to the center of the launch well.  It sways and gyrates above the furious water below.  Lindsey drops into the upper hatch. \nINT. EXPLORER BRIDGE/D.O.C.                                             35 \nKirkhill leans suddenly over the console to look out the window. \nKIRKHILL What the hell is she doing out there?  Son of a bitch... (into microphone) Lindsey... get out of Cab Three.  Bates is taking her down. \nINT. CAB THREE                                                          36 \nLindsey pulls her headset as she dogs down the inside locking levers of the hatch. \nLINDSEY Bates is sick.  Besides I've got more hours in this thing than he does. (to Coffey) A little change of plan. \nThe little sub is swinging like a pendulum on the cable, and the SEALs, jammed in with their equipment in the tiny space, are getting slammed into the walls.  Lindsey is calmly flipping switches as she talks. \nCOFFEY Lady, we better fish or cut bait. \nLINDSEY Just hold your water, okay? (to Kirkhill) So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it? \nBUD Shit. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DEEPCORE                                                           57 \nThe platform is stopped, hovering in place.  Like a great spacecraft setting down on a barren planet, the rig settles into the bottom ooze.  Flatbed releases its tow lines and heads back to its berth inside. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUB-BAY                                                            58 \nCLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH, actually a computer-composited down-looking scan from a towed LIDAR (laser imaging sonar) rig.  It shows a faint, blurry outline of the Montana lying on her side on a ledge part-way down the canyon wall.  There is no detail.  A finger points to a flat ledge nearby.  An \"X\" has been put on with a grease pencil. \nCOFFEY (V.O.) This is us.  We're just on the edge of the Cayman Trough.  The Montana is here, on its side, 300 meters away and 70 meters below us.  We think she slid down the wall, and lodged against this outcropping. \nCUT WIDE, showing the rig crew gathered around a worktable in the sub-bay. The divers, Bud, Catfish, Sonny, Finler, Jammer, and the four SEALs have their dry-suits on.  The pre-dive briefing.  Lindsey, One Night, and Hippy will crew the submersibles.  Wilhite is going around clipping DOSIMETER BADGES on everybody. \nSONNY This tells us how much radiation we get? \nHIPPY Hey, whoah... I can't handle no radiation, man. Forget it!  Include me out. \nCATFISH Hippy, you pussy. \nHIPPY What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months? \nCOFFEY We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple. \nBUD Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek. \nBud pats the top of a small ROV, sitting next to its larger brother, Big Geek. \nHIPPY No way!  No way!  He can't fly an ROV worth shit.  I'll go.  Shit! \nCOFFEY (to all) On the dive, you will do absolutely nothing without direct orders from me, and you will follow my instructions without discussion.  Is this clear?  Alright, I want everyone finished prep and ready to get wet in fifteen minutes. \nThe rig crew disperses, picking up helmets and diving gear.  Some are studying the diagrams of the Montana's interior layout.  Bud takes Coffey aside as the others prepare. \nBUD Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack. \nCOFFEY I can't afford slack, Brigman. \nBUD Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here. \nCOFFEY I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive. \nEnd of discussion.  Coffey is walking away.  Burning, Bud crosses to his gear locker.  Picks up his helmet.  Finler is suiting out next to him. \nFINLER Hey, you know your hand is blue? \nBUD Shut up and get your gear on. \nNEARBY, Monk comes over to pick his helmet up off the worktable.  Hippy points to the heavy equipment case that says F.B.S. DEEP SUIT/MARK IV. \nHIPPY I've been meaning to ask you what this thing is. \nMink opens the case and shows them an unfamiliar diving suit, what looks like a space helmet, and a large backpack. \nMONK Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep. \nHIPPY How deep? \nMONK Deep. (shrugs) It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you. \nCatfish is grappling with the concept. \nCATFISH You're saying you get liquid in your lungs? \nMONK Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion. \nMonk take a clear plastic box full of O-rings off the shelf and dumps them out.  He opens a valve on the backpack and allows some of the fluid inside it to drain into the box.  Then he take Beany by the tail off Hippy's shoulder. \nHIPPY Hey! \nMONK Check this out. \nHe drops Beany in the box and, before Hippy can protest, closes the lid. Beany is forced under the surface.  He struggled for a second, and bubbles come out of his mouth.  Then he casually swims around in there, completely submerged... breathing liquid.  Catfish and the others stare into the box, amazed. \nMONK See?  He's diggin' it. \nMonk takes Beany out and hold him by the tail for a few seconds to drain his lungs.  Then hands him back to Hippy.  The rat is annoyed, but otherwise alright. \nCATFISH This is no bullshit hands down the goddamnedest thing I ever saw. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DEEPCORE/DROPOFF                                                   59 \nThree sets of moving lights move outward from Deepcore.  Cab One and Three, with Lindsey and Hippy at the controls respectively, and One Night in the Flatbed.  Lindsey is in the lead.  She approaches the cliff-like drop-off and starts to descend. \nHippy nods and Perry drops Little Geek through the hatch into the water and feed out a length of tether.  Hippy picks up the control box and watches the video screen, guiding the ROV toward the Montana's hatch. \nEXT. MONTANA HATCH AREA                                                 64 \nThe three SEALs have unlatched the deck cover and revealed the hatch.  They open the out hatch and Monk swims down into to narrow escape trunk.  He bangs on the inner hatch with a wrench, listening carefully with his helmet pressed against it. \nMONK It's flooded.  Alright, I'm opening her up. \nStraining hard in the confined space, he get the lower hatch open, then swims backs out immediately.  He gestures to Hippy, via Little Geek's vision, and Hippy flies the ROV into the hatch. \nEXT./INT. CAB ONE/MISSLE DECK                                           65 \nMeanwhile Cab One and Flatbed have proceeded forward along the hull.  Beyond Lindsey's front port, the great hatches of the Trident missile tubes roll toward us in procession.  Several of the hatch covers have been forced partway open by the warping of the hull. \nCOFFEY (V.O.) Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact. \nLINDSEY How many are there? \nCOFFEY (V.O.) 24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile. \nLINDSEY That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they? \nSCHOENICK Your MIRV is a tactical nuke, 50 kilotons nominal yield.  Say times time Hiroshima. \nLINDSEY (V.O.) Jesus Christ... this is World War Three in a can. \nCOFFEY (V.O.) Let's knock off the chatter, please. \nINT. CAB THREE                                                          66 \nTIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN -- LITTLE GEEK'S CAMERA.  Passing through a hatch, into a large grotto filled with pipes and machinery.  The engine room. \nMONK (V.O.) Getting a reading? \nHIPPY It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe. \nEXT. MONTANA MIDSHIP HATCH                                              67 \nMonk moves into the opening. \nMONK Alright.  Let's get in there. \nWilhite and Schoenick follow him through the escape trunk, into the dark corridor beyond. \nEXT. MONTANA/BOW SECTION                                                68 \nOut of the darkness ahead emerges the trailing edge of the sail, big as a five-story building.  Far below her, Flatbed moves along the edge of the ledge which supports the vast sub.  Its lights, and Lindsey's strobes, reveal the tremendous damage to the forward section as they pass the sail.  The torn and twisted hull looms above Flatbed as it sets down. \nCoffey indicated an enormous rent where the bow section is almost torn away from the rest of the hull. \nCOFFEY We'll go in through that large breach. \nBUD Let's go, guys. \nBud's team leaves Flatbed, swimming forward.  The opening is a black mouth in their lights.  Coffey moves inside.  Bud attaches one end of an orange nylon line to a piece of pipe and moves into the wreck behind him. \nBUD Take it slow, stay on the line, and stay in sight.  Watch for hatches that could close on you, or any loose equipment that could fall. \nJammer, Catfish, Finler, and Sonny follow him inside. \nINT. MONTANA/FORWARD BERTHING SECTION                                   69 \nThey find themselves in the forward berthing compartment with its rows of bunks.  The room is twisted and disheveled, with bedding hanging from the bunks like the lolling tongues of dead dogs.  Papers float in gentle eddying currents, letters, pages from paperback novels, photos of girlfriends. Bud pays out the line and follows Coffey forward.  As they pass sealed doors, Coffey pounds with a tool, listening.  All flooded. \nINT. ENGINE ROOM                                                        70 \nMonk leads his team along a corridor, following Little Geek's tether.  Through a hatch into the engine room.  Their lights play over flooded machinery. \nINT. COMPANIONWAY/CONTROL ROOM AND ATTACK CENTER                        71 \nFrom the berthing Coffey's team swims up a companionway towards the attack center.  He pulls at a buckled watertight door. \nCOFFEY It's jammed.  Give me a hand. \nJammer and Bud squeeze in around Coffey.  Together they wrench the door open on its squealing hinges.  It give way suddenly, flying open.  The suction pulls SOMETHING THROUGH.  It slams Bud's shoulder.  He turns.  A FACE... RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!  He jerks back, gasping. \nFace to face with Barnes, the sonarman.  The ensign seems unmarked, merely dismayed at his own mortality, judging from his wide eyes and mouth.  Coffey reaches past Bud and pushes the ensign's body out of the way. \nCOFFEY Alright, let's keep moving.  We knew we were going to see this. \nThey enter the control room.  Their lights play over the high-tech wreckage. Floating debris and bodies make shifting shadows on the walls as they swirl in the currents.  A languid, weightless waltz.  They move through the carnage. Their lights pick out tableaux... the planesman still strapped in his chair, someone jammed into the ceiling pipes, hanging down.  Dead faces, pale in the lights.  Still.  We see only glimpses. \nCoffey locates the captain's body and rolls it over.  Removes the missile arming key which hangs on a chain around the dead man's neck.  Moves on. All business.  Bud turns back to his guys.  Checking them.  He notices Jammer is breathing so rapidly he's fogging his helmet.  Catfish, Finler, and Sonny aren't much better.  A wave a panic seems imminent. \nBUD How you guys doing? \nSONNY I'm alright, I'm dealing. \nCATFISH Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry... \nThe glare pulses subtly, hypnotically.  The shifting shadow falls across Jammer.  He finally snaps out of his fixity... \nScreaming and gulping air he spins away and starts clawing hand over hand through the treacherous wreckage. \nHis harness catches on a twisted pipe. \nHe struggles, totally out of control... the big man reduced to a blind panic. \nJammer heaves forward with all his adrenalized strength. \nHe tears free of the entangling debris.  Launches like a torpedo... slamming his backpack full force into the top sill of the hatchway.  His tri-mix regulator takes the full brunt of the impact. \nON BUD, swimming furiously back toward Jammer's position.  The strange radiance is gone.  His dive light flare back to full brightness. \nBUD Jammer?  Answer me, buddy,  JAMMER?! \nHe reaches Jammer only to find him thrashing violently in place.  A seizure. Bud grapples with him. \nBUD Hang on, big guy.  Hand on! \nCatfish, Sonny, and Finler arrive from the corridor a moment later.  They leap into the fray. \nBUD He's convulsing! \nCATFISH It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen! \nThen they're all yelling at once, grappling with the big man, struggling with the valves on his breathing gear. \nFINLER Crank it down, man!  We're gonna losing him... \nBUD SHIT, it's stuck... goddamnit! \nSONNY You got it?!  You got it? \nBUD Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning. \nJammer's convulsion ends.  He goes limp. \nBUD We gotta get him out of here.  Come on! (to Jammer) Hang on, buddy. \nThey drag Jammer's slack form into the corridor, hauling their way rapidly back along the lifeline. \nINT./EXT. CAB ONE & MONTANA SAIL                                        79 \nLindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail, maneuvering to clear the horizontal diving plane.  Then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose power. \nSuddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and SOMETHING appears right in front of her, a glowing object moving like a bat out of hell right at her!  It is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get a glimpse.  What we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid, open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside... like some hallucinatory jet engine.  And it's hauling ass. \nLindsey jinks left.  The object jogs right.  She fights the control as her sub slews around, slamming broadside into the sail.  K-BAM!  Her power comes back up.  Righting Can One, she spins to look through the aft viewport in time to see the object racing away in a broad arc.  It pulls a high-G turn and dives straight down. \nWe see the object zip behind Flatbed.  One Night can't see it.  The thing spirals down into the darkness like a hit-and-run drunk, diving along the wall into the abyss until it is lost to view. \nHOLD ON Lindsey excited, amazed... dazed.  Her hands are shaking.  Suddenly Bud's voice blares out over the open frequency. \nBUD (V.O.) CAB ONE!  CAB ONE!  Meet me at Flatbed!  This is a diver emergency!!  Do you copy?  Lindsey?! \nShe has a hard time focusing on what he's saying.  Finally... \nLINDSEY Copy you, Bud.  On my way. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DEEPCORE INFIRMARY -- AN HOUR LATER                                80 \nJammer is unconscious on a folding cot set up in the tiny cubicle of the infirmary.  Monk, who is cross-trained as a medic as well as a demolitions man, has hung an IV of something.  Bud and the SEAL are in the room, the others hovering outside. \nBUD Whattya think? \nMONK I'm a medic, which is mostly about patching holes.  This type of thing... there's not much I can do.  The coma could last hours or days. \nBud, torn by guilt, gazes at the big man lying pathetically on the cot. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CONSOLE MODULE                                                     81 \nThe SEALs, minus Monk, are all gathered inside, debriefing with DeMarco via closed-circuit video. \nDEMARCO (video) Did any of you see it? \nCOFFEY Negative.  But there was definitely a Russian bogey.  The Brigman woman saw it. \nDEMARCO CINCLANTFLT's gonna go apeshit.  Two Russian attack subs, a Tango and Victor, have been tracked within fifty miles of here... and now we don't know what the hell they are.  Okay, I don't have any choice.  I'm confirming you to go to Phase Two. \nWilhite and Schoenick glance uneasily at each other. \nCoffey is silent.  He is vibrating with tension... his fists clenched to prevent the shaking.  He is wrestling with the moment, knowing it is, in a way, a point of no return. \nDEMARCO Is there any problem? \nBUD Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy. \nHIPPY Everything is. \nOne Night is pounding down the corridor from the sub bay. \nONE NIGHT Hurry up!  Coffey's splitting with Flatbed! He got me to show him the controls, then his guys suited up and they're rolling. \nBud breaks into a run, passing her. \nBUD Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now? \nONE NIGHT I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP. \nINT. SUB BAY                                                            85 \nBud clears the door in time to see an empty moonpool, roiling with turbulence. He runs to the edge and looks down.  Flatbed is a vague shape moving off. \nBUD Unbelievable. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                             86 \nThe sky is charcoal, the sea is a mountain range of gray slopes.  Waves thunder over the foredeck, whipped by eighty-know winds.  Men in life jackets scurry like insects.  Off the port bow, the ASW destroyer ALBANY vanishes and reappears among waves sixty feet tall.  McBride scream orders that can't be heard to the crewmen on deck.  He staggers back along the bridge railing. \nINT./EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                87 \nMcBride steps into the quiet of the control room.  He turns on De Marco. \nMCBRIDE We're trying to get unhooked and get out of here... and your boys go sightseeing! \nDEMARCO They'll be back in two hours. \nMCBRIDE Two hours?!  We're gonna be getting the shit kicked out of us by our friend Fred in two hours! \nDe Marco's expression is infuriatingly calm... icy.  McBride looks at his watch and swears under his breath. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. USS MONTANA WRECK SITE                                             88 \nFor a second time the black hull of the ballistic missile sub is illuminated by diver's lights.  Tiny figures, the divers move like moths around a distant streetlight.  Wilhite, Monk and Schoenick are clustered around an open missile hatch.  Using a large lift bag, they are removing the frangible fiberglass, or 'diaphragm'.  Coffey pilots Flatbed with increasing deftness, deploying the big arm to aid in the work. \nDOWN ANGLE as the diaphragm lifts away... revealing the blunt nose of the TRIDENT C-4 MISSLE.  Like looking down the barrel of a gun at the bullet aimed right at you. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Little is known at this hour about the events leading up to the collision.  The US Navy guided missile  cruiser Appleton apparently struck the Soviet 'Udaloy' class destroyer in low visibility conditions... \nVARIOUS CUTS of men in life jackets among huge waves...

Bathed in the light of the video screen. \nNEWSCASTER (V.O.) ... just learned that Soviet negotiators have walked out of the strategic arms limitation summit in protest over the incident this morning. \nBud switches the channel. \nANOTHER NEWSCASTER ... US and NATO military forces have been put on full alert worldwide this morning in the wake of... \nBUD It's on every channel. \nLindsey is working, up to her knees in water.  She is covered with grease, tools scattered around.  Bud puts his hand on her shoulder.  She looks up, blows some hair out of her eyes. \nBUD What's the scoop, ace? \nLINDSEY I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down. \nRather than trigger anger and invective, the disaster seems to have affected her in a different way.  She's accepted the situation, now that's it's done, and is immersing herself in technical tasks, which are for her therapeutic. \nBUD Need some help? \nLINDSEY Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker. \nBUD What about O-2? \nLINDSEY Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using. \nBUD The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours. \nLINDSEY I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them. \nShe goes back to her task, working efficiently with a socket wrench. \nBUD Hey, Lins... (she looks up) I'm glad your here. \nLINDSEY Yeah?  Well I'm not. \nOMITTED                                                                 121 \nOMITTED                                                                 122 \nThe sub bay is still a mess.  Dark.  A few battery-operated lamps.  Flatbed is back, floating in the moonpool. \nOne Night and Hippy are in deep concentration, piloting the two ROVs in a damage survey of the rig.  Bud comes up behind them, check her screen first. BIG GEEK'S MONITOR shows a view of the aft section of the rig.  The drilling derrick had collapsed across Cab Three, totaling it.  A girder is jammed through its acrylic front dome. \nONE NIGHT Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss. \nBUD (to Hippy) Where're you? \nHIPPY Quarters.  Level two. \nINT. TRIMODULE A/QUARTERS                                               A123 \nLittle Geek rises up through the open central hatch, pivoting in a circle to scan the flooded interior. \nINT. SUB BAY/R.O.V.

The lights of the little robot fall upon a figure... Perry. Lying on the deck, almost looking like he's asleep. \nHIPPY That's Perry. \nBUD (lets his breath out slowly) That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus. \nHIPPY (gestured at the screen) Do we just leave him there? \nBUD Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

Walking, they pull their umbilicals behind them and head out through the twisted wreckage.  Little Geek follows along like a dog at their heels.  They settle beside a valve assembly at the base of the wrecked module. \nLINDSEY Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out. \nCATFISH You watch yourself. \nHe begins to attach one end of a coiled-up high-pressure hose to a manifold. She takes the other end of the hose and moves off into the darkness.  Little Geek goes with her faithfully. \nINT.

Bud is nearby, tending hose for the divers and handing her tools.  Talking while they work.  Hippy is across the moonpool running Little Geek. \nONE NIGHT Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension. (he hands it to her) So there you were-- \nBUD There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together. \nONE NIGHT Doesn't mean you had to marry her. \nBUD We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks. \nONE NIGHT Okay, good reason.  Then what? \nBUD It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago. \nONE NIGHT She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it. \nBUD Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!! \nHe's jammed his fingers with a wrench torquing down a bolt.  Whips his hand out. \nLINDSEY Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent... \nHIPPY You mean like Coffey? \nLindsey is reddening.  Despite her conviction, this is really hard. \nLINDSEY A non-terrestrial intelligence. \nHIPPY Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects. \nHippy is not really mocking her.  He's actually into it.  But it has that effect.  Catfish is eyeing Lindsey like he's never seen her before. \nCATFISH Are we talkin' little space friend here? \nHIPPY Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who-- \nLINDSEY Hippy, do me a favor... stay off my side. \nBud takes her firmly by the arm.  Heads her out into the corridor. \nBUD Lindsey, will you step into my office for a minute... \nINT. CORRIDOR/LADDER WELL                                               130 \nHe propels her along the corridor, away from the mess hall doorway.  They face each other in the narrow space. \nBUD Jesus, Lindsey-- \nLINDSEY Bud, something really important is happening here. \nBUD Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria-- \nLINDSEY Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical! \nThey're talking across each other, not connecting.  Bud weary and frustrated. Lindsey is cranked up with the afterglow of her encounter. \nBUD All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around. \nLINDSEY I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry. \nBUD God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew. \nLINDSEY I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech? \nBUD No. \nLINDSEY Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. \nBud is stilled by her intensity.  She moves close to him.  Eyes alive and luminous. \nLINDSEY It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling. \nBUD How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'? \nLINDSEY We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that. \nBud has been taking this all in.  His eyes tracking her face.  He closes his eyes, taking a deep breath.  It's so hard for him to do this, but... \nBUD I can't, Lindsey.  I'm sorry.  How can I? \nCUT TO: \nINT. MESS HALL -- LATER                                                 131 \nCoffey has Bud, Lindsey and several of the rig crew gathered for a little summit.  Lindsey is withdrawn, sitting far from the others, a self-imposed exile.  They're all wearing warm clothes and hugging themselves.  Their breath shows in the air. \nCOFFEY I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion. \nLINDSEY (rolling her eyes) Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian. \nCoffey looks at her for a moment, then goes on as if she hadn't spoke. \nCOFFEY (to One Night) Why haven't you finished repairs on the hydrophone transmitter yet? \nONE NIGHT I was having my nails done. \nCoffey is sweating, despite the chill.  Keeps his hands clenched in fists so they won't see how bad the tremors have gotten. \nCOFFEY Get something straight.  You people are under my authority-- \nCATFISH Look, podner... we don't work for you, we don't take orders from you, and we don't much like you. In addition to which your momma dresses you funny. \nCoffey's eyes are straight razors.  He slashes them from face to face.  You can see him tightening up like a clockspring, losing control of the situation in front of his own men.  Bud defuses it. \nBUD 'Fish'? \nCATFISH Yuh? \nBUD Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay? \nINT.

I mean it. \nHIPPY Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands? \nLINDSEY He's got the shakes? \nBUD Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while? \nHIPPY Man, I give this a sphincter-factor of about nine point five. \nINT.

Eternal night. \nANGLE FROM OUTSIDE.  Coffey's face in the window.  Stuck to the acrylic bubble beside him is one of those Garfields, suction cups on its paws.  Coffey stares out.  Behind his eyes, his brain is like that cat, just hanging on, spreadeagle and screaming. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

The ROV grins maniacally with goofy shark teeth. \nLINDSEY Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right? \nHIPPY Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada. \nLINDSEY Let's go for it.  We could get lucky. \nINT.

Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little. \nHIPPY (V.O.) I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J.

In the mess hall, Catfish and Bud are crashed out on the tables, wrapped in blankets.  The cold has gotten intense.  Water drips.  The walls sweat with condensation.  Lindsey can see her breath as she makes coffee.  She carries a cup over to Monk, who is a face in a pile of blankets.  A hand comes out, takes the coffee. \nMONK Thanks. \nLindsey sips hers, staring.  Her thoughts are far away... in the bottomless pit.  She is leaning up against the table where Bud is sleeping.  His soft snoring downshifts into a loud rasp.  Lindsey touches him gently on the shoulder. \nLINDSEY Virgil, turn on your side. \nBud grunts and turns without waking, an automatic response.  The snoring stops.  It is a quiet, intimate moment, a reminder of the mileage these two have logged together. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

On the main passive-sonar screen, an almost imperceptibly faint trace appears.  A HUM, which is by now familiar, becomes audible.  Sonny shifts in his seat.  Doesn't wake. \nINT.

Hey, I told you to wipe that grin off your face. \nHe yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor door.  Switches off the lights.  Goes out. \nQuiet lapping of water in the moonpool.  A beat.  Then... \nA cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening, sending shadows shifting across the top of the chamber.  The surface begins to pulsate. \nSuddenly, the water itself rises, forming itself into a shifting, shimmering pseudopod as big around as a man's body.  The transparent form pulses... an amoebic mass shivering in the air. \nIt stretches, becoming a more refined form.  Like a blindly probing glass python, it elongates and weaves across the room.  It extends and extends, stretching out from the moonpool, a shimmering tentacle.  The 'head' or tip, a featureless liquid bulb, seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward, as if it can see where it's going. \nINT. CORRIDOR                                                           143 \nHippy trudges along the dark corridor.  He reaches the men's head and goes in. As the door closes, the tip of the liquid pseudopod extends into the corridor B.G.  It 'looks' left and right.  Then extends the length of the corridor, holding itself a couple feet off the floor like a weightless snake. \nINT.

The pseudopod enters and undulates upward. \nFROM INSIDE THE MAKESHIFT BUNKROOM, we see its tip extend inside. \nCATFISH Maybe I oughta shave. \nCoffey stands abruptly, snags Schoenick with his eyes, and leaves, walking through the group as if they were smoke.  This cold behavior brings the mood down a notch. \nINT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                        151 \nOutside the mess hall, Coffey pauses, listening to the conversation resume. Bright speculation, a few jokes.  Coffey is visible shaking.  Breathing hard. Pupils dilated.  Schoenick looks at him with concern. \nCOFFEY It went straight for the warhead.  And they think it's cute. \nSCHOENICK You need to get some sleep. \nCoffey walks away without hearing him.  Schoenick catches up. \nINT.

Unzips it.  Pulls out a short-barreled CAR-15 assault rifle. \nCOFFEY We have no way of warning the surface.  Do you know what that means? \nSchoenick doesn't know.  He hopes Coffey knows.  Because he's a fearless man who's discovering what it is to be afraid.  Coffey inserts the magazine with a CLACK!  Snaps the bolt.  Tosses the rifle to Schoenick. \nCOFFEY It means... whatever happens is up to us. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Or from... you know. \nShe jerks her thumb toward the ceiling. \nLINDSEY I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light. \nCATFISH Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly. \nINT. CORRIDOR/SUB BAY                                                   155 \nHippy freezes in the corridor as he hears a loud ratcheting sound echoing from the sub-bay.  He edges forward slowly, trying to keep his feet silent on the steel floor.  Slides up along the wall next to the door.  Inches his eye around the doorframe.  Across the room. Schoenick is working with a chainfall, lowering Big Geek onto the MIRV warhead, which is still on its cart.  He begins to attach them together with a sling of tie-down straps. \nHippy lets his breath out slowly.  His expression is Holy Shit. \nHe slides back along the corridor wall, silently.  Away from the door.  Then turn turns quickly to go... WHAM!  Coffey slams him up against the wall! .45 pressed to Hippy's temple.  Hippy gulping air as Coffey ears back the hammer. \nCOFFEY Sniff something did you, rat boy? \nINT. MESS HALL                                                          156 \nThe meeting is breaking up as the door CLANGS open and Hippy is thrusted inside.  His hands are taped behind his back and he stumbles onto his face. Coffey steps through smoothly, straight-arming the .45.  Schoenick flanks him with the assault rifle aimed at the group. \nCOFFEY FREEZE!  Don't move.  That's it. (to Monk) Here, hold this a second.  We're going to phase three. \nHe hands his gun to Monk, with the assumption of absolute loyalty from a team member.  Monk's eyes move between Coffey and the pistol.  We can't tell what he's thinking.  Coffey grabs Hippy and shoves him onto a chair. \nHIPPY They're using Big Geek to take the bomb to the NTIs!  We set it up to go right to them. \nLindsey looks stricken.  Her plan is betraying them all. \nLINDSEY Oh my God...  Oh no... (steps toward Coffey) Please, you can't.  Coffey, think about what you're doing... for God's sake-- \nCoffey lets her approach him, his eyes glittering. \nWithout warning he grabs her by the hair and hurls her against the Coke machine, pinning her there with one hand.  Bud leaps forward. \nSCHOENICK GET BACK! \nBud freezes.  The rifle's muzzle is aimed for a heart-shot. \nCoffey moves up close to Lindsey. \nCOFFEY This is something I've wanted to do since I first met you. \nHis hand reaches down, OUT OF FRAME.  We hear something RIP.  His hand comes back up... holding a piece of gaffer's tape. \nHe slaps it over her mouth.  Then pushes her down into a chair. \nHippy looks at Monk and Schoenick. \nHIPPY You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside! \nMONK What's the timer set for? \nSCHOENICK Three hours. \nBud surges up into the lock.  Catfish jams into the tiny airspace with him. They try the upper hatch.  Jammed.  They're both panting with the exertion and intense cold. \nBUD Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way. \nCATFISH I can't... make it... podner. \nBud looks at Catfish, shivering and heaving, wide-eyed. \nBUD Okay, Cat.  You head back. \nBud hyperventilates rapidly and pikes over diving back out through the hatch. \nEXT. DEEPCORE                                                           164 \nBud is stroking rapidly through the tangle of pipes and conduit.  He sees the lit rectangle of the moonpool far ahead. \nINT. SUB BAY                                                            165 \nIn the moonpool, Bud surface with an explosive gasp beside the full of Flatbed.  His wracked breathing is masked by the WHINE of HYDRAULICS as Coffey uses the external controls to extend Flatbed's big hydraulic arm, locking the Geek/MIRV in its gripper. \nBud strokes to a point where Coffey can't see him and heaves up out of the water onto the deck of the pool.  He lies gasping behind Cab One's cradle. His limbs are wooden and unresponsive from the cold.  His fingers are completely numb.  He hugs himself, putting his hands under his armpits. Scans the situation.  He can't get to the door, which is across the room, without Coffey seeing him. \nINT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     166 \nLindsey watching the whole thing going down, ON THE SCREEN, a high angle of the sub bay... Bud moving up on Coffey. \nHIPPY He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself. \nLINDSEY He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty. \nON THE SCREEN, Bud picks up a piece of pipe.  Hefts it.  Moves forward, crouched... stalking.  Lindsey yells at the screen in frustration. \nLINDSEY BUUUUUD!! \nINT. SUB BAY                                                            167 \nBud chucks a tool across the chamber, creating a clattering distraction, then wades in with the pipe in a vicious swing to the back of Coffey's knees, taking him down.  Coffey spins even as he falls, catching Bud in a scissor kick that topples him. \nGrappling, they fall together into the freezing water. \nCoffey is momentarily stunned by the cold, giving Bud time to haul himself out, hoping to make it to the door. \nCoffey launches from the water and grabs him legs. \nHe pulls himself up as Bud kick out.  Claws his way viciously over Bud's body until he has him pinned to the deck.  Then he pulls out the .45. \nPut it unceremoniously to Bud's forehead. \nINT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     168 \nLINDSEY NOOO!! \nINT. SUB BAY                                                            169 \nCoffey pulls the trigger... CLICK.  Bud flinches, then opens his eyes, staring cross-eyed at the muzzle of the .45.  Coffey cocks it and tries again.  CLICK.  Nothing.  Really pissed off beyond description, Bud hurls the commando off him with a powerful heave, sending him clattering against a rack of equipment.  They face off, panting. \nINT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     170 \nThe rig crew turns from the screen at the sound of Monk's voice. \nMONK I tool the liberty of removing this before I gave it back to him. \nMonk pulls his hand out from under his blanket and holds up the magazine from the .45. \nINT. SUB WAY                                                            171 \nEven so Bud is getting his ass kicked.  Coffey's really trying to put him out of business.  It's mostly duck and dodges on Bud's part.  Throw a few things. When Coffey connects, Bud goes down hard.  Give him credit, though.  He manages to scramble back up. \nThe fight wrecks the room, scattering tools and gear. \nCompressed air cylinders roll dangerously around the floor. \nCoffey slips on one and Buds get in a couple of good licks. \nSlams the SEAL's head in an equipment locker door. \nBut the Navy man is just too massive.  Bud is hammered back into a wall. Coffey has his fist cocked back for the coup de grace.  Spins around at the sound of a VOICE. \nCATFISH Hey! \nCatfish is right behind him.  Dripping wet.  A trail of water goes back to the moonpool a few feet away. \nCRACK!  Catfish's 'Hammer' punch comes in so hard and so fast, Coffey is knocked right on his ass.  He doesn't get up.  Just sort of flops around. \nCatfish helps Bud to his feet.  They advance on Coffey, who crab-scuttles sideways, his eyes rabid. \nHe picks up a helium tank and hurls it at them.  As they duck he sprints to Flatbed and drops through the hatch and slams it down. \nBUD (to Catfish) Get the door! \nCoffey releases the ROV with the gripper and makes a grab at Bud with the steel claw.  Bud dives.  The gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow.  Bud kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out.  We see he has managed to tie one end to Geek's skids.  Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder.  The little robot, pregnant with its load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void. \nCoffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud.  Bud strokes rapidly to a large jumble of wreckage.  He loops the rope around a twisted pipe.  Big Geek is hauling ass away from him.  The line snap taut an instant later.  The ROV strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go.  The rope is slipping as Bud fights to make a knot. \nFlatbed slews around, thrusters whining.  As it banks, it hurls up clouds of sediment from the escarpment face. \nThrough the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls. \nThe big arm extends menacingly.  The smaller from manipulators open.  An enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring. \nThe big machine roars forward.  Straight at Bud. \nBud gets his knot partly done.  See Flatbed looming. \nGlare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as Coffey closes the last few feet. \nOne manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside rakes across his legs as it passes over.  Flatbed crushes into the tangle of pipework.  K-CRUUUNCH!! \nINT. FLATBED                                                            182 \nCoffey is slammed hard over the controls, up into the front dome port.  He gets back in the seat.  Strains to free his machine. \nEXT. DEEPCORE/BIG GEEK/FLATBED                                          183 \nBud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in Coffey's blind area.  Flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris. It pivots toward Bud.  Moves after him. \nNearby, the ROV is whining mindlessly, trying to please.  Trying to GO. DETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip.  The nylon line starts to play through the knot slowly. \nBUD has gotten himself into a bad position.  Along the bare rock face of the cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a truck.  Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward. Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic.  There's no cover, side to side, up or down. \nCoffey has him head in his lights.  Suddenly a bright glare blasts in, blinding Coffey.  He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full throttle. \nAt the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab.  Coffey is smashed sideways by the shock.  He fights to control his vehicle.  Lindsey looks up to see Coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight.  She cruises up over Bud. \nLINDSEY (V.O.) Get in! \nBud gets the lockout hatch open and clambers up into Cab One's belly. \nINT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       184 \nBud flops over the lip of the hatch and slams it shut.  He ditches his helmet. Lindsey raises her vehicle warily above the wall.  Through the front port there is not sign of Coffey. \nLINDSEY You owe me one, Virgil. \nBUD Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek. \nHe points.  Through the front port, they can see the ROV still straining at its leash.  Lindsey dives toward it, simultaneously working the controls to open her own small manipulator claws. \nEXT. DEEPCORE/WALL, ETC.                                                185 \nThe last few feet of the rope slip through the knot. \nBig Geek happily surges forward.  It dives gracefully down into the void, trailing the yellow rope like a kite tail. \nONE CAB ONE, Bud and Lindsey through the front port. \nBUD Go after it!  We gotta catch it! \nFLATBED DROPS INTO FRAME BEHIND THEM, dwarfing little Cab One.  They are slammed viciously as Coffey's submersible hammers into them.  She hits full throttle.  Coffey floors it after Lindsey, ramming her from behind with his more powerful vehicle.  With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim. \nShe arcs back toward the rig.  Flatbed slams her again, for the side.  She fights for control. \nINT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       186 \nBud is tossed around, ricocheting off the walls.  Lindsey flies with her jaw set.  Fighting hard for control.  The A-frame of the rig looms before her. She shoots through at full throttle. \nEXT. DEEPCORE AND OCEAN TERRAIN                                         187 \nNow the fight is really on.  The two subs are dodging between the cylindrical modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure hulls. \nCoffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways.  It screeches along the flank of one of the trimodules. \nThey head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run. \nLindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing up the bottom with its powerful backwash.  Lindsey carves hard around a rock pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon. Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side. \nLindsey snarls.  He's pissing her off.  He shouldn't do that. \nAhead, out of the blackness, another outcropping. \nLindsey rises, cuts right. \nSmashes down into Coffey's craft.  Timing it just right.  He skids catch in the rocks. \nFlatbed slews violently, nosing down.  Crushing into the rocky bottom. Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind. \nIt smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control. \nTangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the wall.  With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds her crippled sub.  Flatbed tumbles over the edge. \nBUD Son of a bitch! \nLINDSEY Calm down, Bud. \nA nervous edge in her voice now.  Bud's turning all around, looking around for anything, trying to think fast.  Water up to their waists.  The sea closing in. \nBUD Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here. \nLINDSEY How? \nBUD I don't know how! \nLINDSEY We've only got one suit. \nBUD I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something. \nLINDSEY Aaargh!!  I'm freezing! \nShe climbs up on the pilots seat, scrunching right up against the ceiling, keeping as much of herself as possible out of the frigid water.  She's shaking all over with the cold, and getting drenched from above by water pouring in. \nLINDSEY Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit. \nBUD Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this... (the rate of flooding) Time I get back you'll be-- \nThat stops the conversation for a second.  About two feet of airspace left. Bud can't believe what this is coming down to.  They both stare at each other for a long moment. \nHe makes a decision.  Starts pulling off his backpack. \nBUD Alright, put this on. \nLINDSEY What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on. \nBUD Don't argue, goddamnit, just-- \nLINDSEY No way!  Forget it.  Not an option. \nBud has his pack off uncoupling it.  She keeps fighting his hands, stopping him, hooking it back up.  The desperation of the situation fuel the struggle. \nBUD Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up-- \nLINDSEY NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're-- \nBUD FUCK LOGIC!! \nThey're both right up against the ceiling, water up to their chests. Lindsey's lips are blue and trembling from the cold. \nLINDSEY Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan... \nBUD What's the plan? \nLINDSEY I drown, you tow me back to the rig-- \nBUD WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!?? \nLindsey's gut-scared... shaking violently, her eyes wide.  But she's keeping it together.  Thinking it out.  Bud see the bottomless pit opening to take her and he can barely think. \nLINDSEY Look, this water is only a couple degrees above freezing.  I drown.  I go into deep hypothermia... my blood like icewater.  I can maybe be revived after ten, fifteen minutes.  You got all the stuff to do it on the rig. \nBud stops moving and looks into her face, inches from him.  The water is up to their necks.  He knows that, as always, infuriatingly, Lindsey is right. \nBUD It is insane. \nLINDSEY It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me. \nShe takes a deep breath.  Before her nerve fails she busies her hands on his suit, rehooking everything. \nBUD Jesus, I don't believe this is happening. \nShe raise his helmet.  Water up to their chins.  They lock eyes, inches apart.  He can feel her breath on his face... maybe for the last time. \nBUD Oh God, Lins... I-- \nLINDSEY Tell me later. \nHe grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his.  They lock together in a fierce kiss, fueled by passion and terror... the naked realization of love hanging over the abyss of death. \nShe breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet over his head.  Seats is down over the neck ring.  Lock the bail-out handle, sealing it.  Even with her head press up into the highest point of the ceiling, Lindsey's mouth is barely above water.  She give a scared little laugh. \nLINDSEY This is maybe not such a great plan, is it? \nShe is half-paralyzed with the cold, shaking pathetically.  Puts her face to the glass of his helmet.  Seconds to go. \nLINDSEY Hold me.  Hold me, Bud... I'm so scared... \nHe can't hear her, but he read her lips.  They clutch each other desperately. The embrace last while the water rises over her mouth and nose.  She starts to choke.  Her hands grip his shoulders like claws.  She bucks and thrashes. Bud holds her, and a scream tears loose from him, a pure agony of the soul. \nBUD NOOOOO!!! \nThe freezing seawater races into her lungs.  Her finger go slack, and her hands float lifelessly. \nBUD No!  NO!  She's not... her heart is strong, she wants to live... can't you see that?  Come on, Lins.  Come on, baby!  Zap her again!  Do it... DO IT! \nThey do.  And Bud works, feverishly.  He lock his lips over hers and starts mouth-to-mouth.  It is frantic, passionate... the kiss of life. \nBUD Come on, breath!  Goddamn it, you bitch, you never backed down from anything in life... now fight! \nHe slaps her face, hard.  Her head lolls.  He smacks her the other way. \nBUD Fight, Goddamnit! \nLINDSEY's POV, from the bottom of the great well.  The circles of faces and light rockets toward us in the blackness, as we soar upward from the pit.  We see Bud yelling, but his voice is distant, windlike. \nBUD FIGHT!! \nTIGHT ON LINDSEY, still.  Then something incredible happens.  Something they will never forget as long as they live.  Lindsey coughs once, weakly, and her hands clench in a spasm. \nBud see it and his expression becomes beatific. \nBUD Come on, Lins.  You can do it... fight your way back, baby... \nThe others look on in wonder as Bud wills this woman back. \nShe starts to cough, weakly at first... then more violently as she draws air into her lungs.  Bud crouches over her, rubbing her limbs... trying to re- establish circulation.  It is like a difficult birth.  Lindsey comes hacking and howling back into the world, wet and naked and fighting for breath. \nBud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath after agonized breath.  He pushes her wet hair back from her face with his trembling hands, and watches her breathe.  Color is returning to her skin as she lies there, gasping weakly. \nONE THE GROUP... Catfish, Hippy, One Night, Jammer, the others... they're all grinning, crying, beaming... gazing at the miracle of her rebirth. \nON BUD... tears are streaming down his face. \nBUD (a whisper, fierce and harsh) You did it, ace. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DEEPCORE/QUARTERS -- LATER                                         196 \nTIGHT ON LINDSEY, sleeping peacefully.  WIDER shows Bud hovering over her, attentive.  They are alone in Bud's tiny cubicle.  Perhaps twenty minutes have passed.  She is completely swaddles in blankets, except for her face, and looks like a waif. \nLindsey's eyes flutter and open.  The first thing she sees is Bud, bending over her.  He can't help himself.  The tears break again and roll down his cheeks.  She seems terribly fragile, but bright and aware.  She smiles, faintly... touches his cheek. \nLINDSEY Hey... big boys don't cry, remember? \nBUD Hi, lady. \nLINDSEY Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh? \nBUD 'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel. \nLINDSEY I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay? \nBud's expression turn inexplicably grim. \nBUD Well, you got that right. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Everybody is grouped around, buckling and zipping.  He is hyperventilating with an oxygen mask, part of the procedure for transitioning from air to fluid breathing.  Monk, on his stretcher, is presiding.  The resident expert.  Lindsey is wrapped in a blanket, still looking wan and frail.  She doesn't have the strength to resist Bud's will, but she's trying. \nLINDSEY No, Bud, no... not you. \nBUD Who then? \nShe looks around at the others.  Sees their eyes.  The fear.  Has her answer. He lowers the helmet over his head.  Catfish clamps it down.  We see what's driving him... his sense of responsibility for these people, for not being able to prevent this situation. \nHe touches her cheek, one last time.  She sees his fingers are trembling. Then he puts on the gloves.  Catifsh is strapping a KEYPAD UNIT onto Bud's forearm.  Lindsey wants to scream... to stop this madness. \nBUD (muffled) So I'll hear you, but I can't talk? \nMONK The fluid prevents your larynx from making sound.  It'll feel a little strange. \nBUD (muffled) Warning you now, folks, I'm a lousy typist. (a beat) The moment of truth, huh? \nHis breathing is shallow and tense.  He looks at Lindsey.  The eyes of a condemned man.  She squeezes his hand.  He takes a deep breath. \nBUD Okay.  Let's rock and roll. \nMonk gently cracks a valve on the suit's feed line.  The breathing fluid (3M fluorocarbon emulsion FX-80) swirls into the helmet.  Bud reflexively raises his chin.  The liquid fills toward his mouth. \nMONK Relax now, Bud.  Just keep breathing as it fills... don't fight it.  Take it in.  Just let yourself take it in. \nSuddenly, there's nothing in there to breathe but liquid.  His eyes go wide, instant panic.  He starts to thrash.  Chest heaving. \nMONK Hold him.  Hold him.  This is normal... it'll pass in a second.  You're gonna be okay.  We all breathe liquid for nine months, Bud.  Your body will remember. \nLindsey grabs Bud's shoulders, steadying him.  He finds her eyes, the look calming him.  He's passed into a realm from which she has already returned. His spasms subside.  He begins to \"breathe\" normally.  He gets a goofy look of wonder on his face, not really believing what he's experiencing.  He is alive, alert and quite completely drowned inside the FBS helmet.  He grins. Gives a big thumbs up.  Lindsey picks up a microphone. \nLINDSEY No!  You can make it!  You hear me?  Drop your weights... you... can breathe shallow... you... it could be wrong-- \nLindsey's voice has twisted into a sob.  She begins to weep, quietly. \nLINDSEY Oh God, Virgil, please... \nDONT CRY BABY \nA pause.  Then the words... \nWE KNEW THIS WAS A ONE WAY TICKET WHEN I PUT THIS THING ON.  BUT YOU KNOW I HAD TO COME. \nLindsey sobs at the mike.  The others look away.  The signal is weakening. One Night boosts it and the screen clears briefly. \nLOVE YOU WIFE. \nShe stares at the printout. \nLINDSEY Love you. \nThere is no reply. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE ABYSS                                                          222 \nA tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert ROV, an Indian dying with his horse in the desert. \nBud's eyelids close.  His chest barely moving. \nA strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open.  He blinks.  Weakly, he raises his head, facing the source of the radiance. \nBUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision.  It seems to be an angel.  Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish.  Its body and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass.  A delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer.  The head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a cold, dispassionate wisdom. \nIt is stunningly beautiful. \nThe creature settles toward him.  Unafraid, Bud extends his hand. \nIts slender, blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove.  It pulls him up from the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the abyss. \nAt the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below.  They resolve into NTI ships.  Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey nearly collided with at the Montana wreck.  The larger manta-ships.  And others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish. \nSuddenly the darkness explodes with light.  A vast, reticulated pattern of brightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below them, covering the floor of the abyssal trench.  It sweeps outward from the center, as if the light were surging through channels.  The NTIs are revealing their home to Bud.  The ships move among the spires like air traffic over a major city. \nEXT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE                                                   223 \nBud and the creature descend until, between the lines of light, we see a dark surface of inhuman design.  The shape extends beyond the limits of visibility. Towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface.  It dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it, approaching an opening that soon yawns like a vast mouth. \nThey are picking up speed, swept along by a powerful current, into the mouth- like opening. \nINT.

It is a curving three-dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system, where controlled currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional space.  Tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main-routes hundreds of feet across, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur. \nINT. FINAL CHAMBER                                                      225 \nEntering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor, and the NTI moves back a few feet. \nA shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the chamber.  The seawater divides, like the Red Sea, into two rippling walls. They move apart.  Leaving Bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway. \nWeakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free.  Drops to his knees. Doubles over as spasms wrack him.  Breathing fluid explodes from his lungs. He lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what he can only hope is air.  It is. \nBud slowly recovers, sitting up.  His head is clearing.  This really is happening.  Beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the NTI being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven is gathered watching him. \nBUD Howdy, Uuuh... how you guys doin'? \nHis voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber.  Soft laps of water from the 'walls'. \nIn the air a pattern of glowing lines appears, a series of what appears to be circuit diagrams.  Bud staggers back from this strange 'screen' hanging in mid-air.  The image is about twenty feet across. \nThere is a rolling jumble of static and interference which resolves into... the face of Dan Rather, doing the evening news.  STATIC, then another newscast.  And another.  Fragments of the same story.  The world on the brink of war. \nBUD You watch out TV?  That what you're trying to say?  That you know what's been going on up there? \nThe NTIs are impassive.  Static... then another newscast. \nThis time, we're allowed to focus on the story.  An on-the-scene interview outside a high-tech seismology lab.  There is an air of hysteria about the scene... technicians running across the background of the shot, people shouting, the reporter jamming his mike at the harried-looking scientist. \nREPORTER ... a Caltech scientist who is among those reporting an unprecedented disturbance in the world's oceans.  Dr. Breg, can you give us a clearer explanation then we're getting? \nBerg is edgy and distracted.  People keeps handing him pieces of paper, computer hardcopy.  The biggest thing in his life is happening... \nBERG They're acoustic shockwaves, like tsunamis, but with no seismological source.  The waves are propagating toward the shorelines of every continent-- \nAn assistant runs up, face shiny with fear, beckoning.  We see that Berg is running scared.  The impossible bringing the greatest terror to the rational mind. \nBERG Yeah.  I'll be right there... I have to go. Look, we don't know what it is!  Okay?  Not the slightest goddamn idea! \nThe image dissolves into static, fades out.  Bud turns to the NTIs. \nA woman is collapsed on a bench, crying. \nA man is on his knees, shaking. \nTotal strangers hug each other. \nA black guy, tears pouring down his face, turns to the camera with a beautific grin. \nGUY Somebody just laid it down to us, man.

You could've done it.  Why didn't you? \nThe screen darkens.  Then letters appears on it, slowly printing out, as if someone was clumsily typing them. \nWE KNEW THIS WAS... \nAnd we've seen this before so we know the rest... \nWE KNEW THIS WAS A ONE WAY TICKET WHEN I PUT THIS THING ON.  BUT YOU KNOW I HAD TO COME. \nA pause, then: \nLOVE YOU WIFE \nThe last message expands to fill the entire screen. \nBud stares at the screen, at his message of self-sacrifice, then at the aliens.  They bow their heads, just for a moment.  A sign of respect. \nCLOSE ON BUD as he begins to realize what has happened. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Withdrawn. \nThe others are conserving oxygen and heat, huddling in the dark. \nThe air is looking pretty thick.  The speaker of the hydrophone transceiver crackles to life. \nMCBRIDE (V.O.) Deepcore, do you read?  This is Benthic Explorer, over. \nCATFISH Hell yes, we read!  Good of you to join us.  How's that storm doin'? \nMCBRIDE Well, it's strange... it just kind've blew itself out all of the sudden.  We're up here in a flat sea with no wind.

You better get us a line down here, we're in moderately poor shape. \nLATER, Hippy, Catfish, and Monk are conferring B.G. on how to get a new umbilical hooked on.  One Night is talking to McBride on the hydrophone. \nMCBRIDE They figure is was over a half mile high. \nONE NIGHT I wish I could have seen it-- \nShe glances down at the telemetry screen, seeing movement. \nONE NIGHT Hey.  Hey!  HEY!!  Look... it's Bud. \nMONK That's impossible. \nLindsey bolts to the screen.  Stares at the message printing out. \nA huge grin wraps around her face. \nLINDSEY No it's not. \nMCBRIDE (V.O.) What's it say? \nLindsey take the mike and sits before the screen.  During the message, her voice will go through an emotional spectrum from confusion to wonder, to a childlike joy. \nINTERCUT BETWEEN DEEPCORE AND EXPLORER BRIDGE DURING THE FOLLOWING: \nLINDSEY It says... \"VIRGIL BRIGMAN BACK ON THE AIR/HAVE SOME NEW FRIENDS DOWN HERE/I GUESS THEYVE BEEN HERE AWHILE/ THEYVE LEFT US ALONE BUT IT BOTHERS THEM TO SEE US HURTING EACH OTHER/GETTING OUT OF HAND LATELY\" \nLindsey grins as she reads the next part... \nLINSEY \"THEY SENT A MESSAGE/HOPE YOU GOT IT\" \nCATFISH I'd say that's a big 10-4, jack. \nLINDSEY \"THEY WANT US TO GROW UP A BIT AND PUT AWAY CHILDISH THINGS/OF COURSE ITS JUST A SUGGESTION.\" \nINT.

Everyone silent... leafing through beat-to-hell magazines or just staring.  Lindsey has her feet propped up on the smaller of the SEALs' two equipment cases.  She casually toes open one of the latches, then the other.  Glances at Coffey.  He's reading.  She begins to lift the lid with her toe.  Gets a GLIMPSE INSIDE, of packing foam, and what looks like a SMALL BLACK METAL BOX.  Then... WHAM!  Coffey's foot comes down on the lid, slamming it shut.  Startled, she looks up into his cool gaze. \nCOFFEY Curiosity killed the cat. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Lindsey exists first, followed by Monk, Wilhite, and Schoenick.  Coffey bends to relatch the small equipment case.  He is alone for one moment in the chamber.  He raises his hand and stares at it.

I don't remember a wall here.  Oh, Jammer!  Hi. \nThe 'wall' grins down to her. \nJAMMER Howdy, there, little lady. \nCoffey emerges behind them and, ignoring Lindsey, faces Jammer. \nCOFFEY (to Jammer) Show us the dive prep area.

He is making kissing sounds at Beany, who has his inquisitive nose right up to Hippy's lips. \nLINDSEY Hippy, you're going to give that rat a disease. \nWIDER, as Hippy and Bud to see Lindsey leaning in the doorway.  She and Bud size each other up.  He opts for a jovial approach, his eyes wary. \nBUD Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman. \nLINDSEY Not for long. \nLindsey crossed past him, her eyes scanning the banks of equipment, almost unconsciously checking, checking... getting the pulse of her big iron baby. \nBUD You never did like being called that, did you? \nLINDSEY Not even when it meant something. (looking through the front port) Is that One Night up in Flatbed? \nBUD Who else? \nLindsey leans past Bud to the gooseneck mike on the console. \nLINSEY Hi, One Night, it's Lindsey. \nINT.

She tweaks some knobs. \nBUD I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb. \nLINDSEY Look, I didn't come down here to fight. \nShe crosses past Bud and exits into the corridor.

He almost slams into her.  She moves on, climbing down the ladder to the lower level. \nLINDSEY You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done? \nBUD Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.

Her eyes rove constantly over fittings, gauges, circuit panels. \nBUD (yelling) You wanna know what I think? \nLINDSEY Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons. \nShe scowls at a pressure gauge and turn a valve minutely. \nBUD I think you were worried about me. \nLINDSEY That must be it. \nLindsey's on the move again, and Bud scrambles through the pipes to keep up. \nBUD No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it. \nLINDSEY I was worried about the rig.

You can grab a couple hours before we get there. \nLindsey slips past him into his tiny state-room, the only private bunk on the rig.  Rank had its privileges.  His hand on the door is just level with her eyes.  She notices his wedding ring, a massive band of pure titanium (something your fiancee might have picked out if she had a degree from M.I.T.). \nLINDSEY What are you still wearing that for? \nBUD I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off. \nBud stays in the doorway.  Lindsey takes a heaps of Bud's cloths off the narrow bunk.  Start unconsciously straightening the room. \nLINDSEY I haven't worn mine in months. \nBUD Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit. \nLINDSEY Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael. \nLindsey takes off her borrowed tennies and socks. \nBud eyes her, sounding too causal. \nBUD So what about \"Michael\" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him? \nLINDSEY No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks. \nBUD What happened? \nLINDSEY Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more. \nBUD I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh. \nLINDSEY You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms. \nShe closes the watertight door, forcing him out.  Locks it.  She turns and throws her shoe hard against the far wall. \nLINDSEY AAAARRRGGH! \nShe flops down on the bed, sitting... staring at the wall.  Her armor is gone.  She looks small and vulnerable.

He pulls the ring off roughly and throws it into the toilet.  He reaches forward to flush.  Can't do it.  Now really pissed off at himself, he reaches into the toilet bowl, wrist deep in the chemical-blue water, and salvages the ring. He puts it on and washes his hands.

The rig is twisted and dented, covered with loops of umbilical, trimodule-A a mass of wreckage. The ROV passes across the front of the control module.  Through the front port, two figures can be seen in the light of a single emergency lamp. \nSONNY (V.O. static) Mayday, mayday.  This is Deepcore Two calling Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over? \nINT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     B118 \nSonny flips some switches on the UQC acoustic transceiver.

The power off... everything lit by emergency lights.  Makeshift quarters have been set up in the mess hall, with blankets laid out on the tables, and with folding cots in the storage room across the hall.  Jammer is still unconscious.  Coffey and Schoenick bring Monk in on a stretcher, and set him up on a table.  He is conscious but dazed with painkillers, his led splinted. \nBUD Did you find Wilhite? \nCOFFEY No. \nHe and Bud lock eyes.  Bud bites back on his recriminations, but his gaze blames Coffey.  He turns away. \nCOFFEY Brigman. (Bud turns) I was under orders.  I had no choice. \nCoffey's manner is subdued, contrite.  A marked contrast to his previous brusque arrogance.  He's wrestling with his own loss, a sever blow to the tight brotherhood of a SEAL unit.  Bud's anger is not dispelled.  But he can't address it now.  He moves on. \nPAST THE INFIRMARY, where Sonny Dawson is rigging a sling over his own broken arm.  He cries out in pain, cursing at himself.  LOOKING DOWN THE CENTRAL WELL as Bud crosses.  Down through the grill decking we can see the bottom level of the module is flooded.  Catfish is down there welding, sending shivering reflections through the chamber. \nINT.

Thousands of then glide in ghostly arcs around him, filling the black void as far as the eye can see.  He stares at them in wonder.  Reaches out and touches one, catches it, lets it go.

He stares upwards, transfixed.  BUD'S POV, the ghostly blizzard of luminescence above him.  A spectral form takes shape in the patternless glow... resolving into Lindsey's face, a hundred feet wide. Gazing down at him, her expression sad.  Her image receded away from him into the darkness above as he falls. \nDOWN ANGLE ON BUD, reaching up in anguish. \nINT.

His eyes keep rolling back, and he's having a hard time staying conscious.  He tries to type a message and he can't.  The tons of pressure per square inch are short-circuiting his nervous system.  Suddenly K-BAM!  Little Geek's pressure hull implodes.  Its lights go out.  BLACKNESS. \nINT.

Then a bright light appears... he's lit a MAGNESIUM FLARE. \nIt's fierce, flickering glare lights his plunge.  Bud discards the stalwart little ROV and free-falls like a skydiver without a chute.  Out of control, he hits a ledge and rolls off.  Tumbles forward in a cloud of debris.  He hits another outcropping, limp as a rag doll.  Rocks and sand rain down with him as he continues his descent. \nBud us quivering, teeth locked in a titanic rigor. \nHe pulls his arms and legs slowly into a fetal position. \nIn the plunge toward death he has gone he has gone full circle, returned to the womb in which we all breathe the water of life before we know the world of air and light.  Still, there is Lindsey's voice, faintly in his helmet. \nLINDSEY (V.O.) You remember that time, you were pretty drunk, you probably don't remember... the power went out at the old apartment, the one on Orange Street... and we were staring at that one little candle, and I said something really dumb like that candle is me, like every one of us is out there alone in the dark in this life... \nINT.

His expression is rapt. \nLOOKING DOWN, past his to a ghostly landscape.  His last flare sputters out, but there is light.  Bioluminescent algae carpet the walls of the canyon below him.  And he's right... it is beautiful. \nThe water is so clear we can see down 500 feet past Bud's tiny, silhouetted figure, to a vast landscape faintly revealed in spectral pastels.  Barren as the moon but exquisite, serene.  Changeless.  A place unseen by human eyes. Like a firefly below, the lights of Big Geek are visible.  Bud descends toward the ROV, which has grounded on a narrow shelf.  Below the shelf, the wall slopes out, suggesting we are near the bottom of the canyon but can't see it. \nONE BIG GEEK/MIRV, sitting there like a dumbshit.  Bud's feet thump into the sediment next to it, stirring it luminous particles.  Touchdown... three and half miles of water over his head.  Bud leans over the warhead in a swarm of fireflies. \nINT.

It's the blue wire with the white stripe, not... I repeat... NOT the black wire with the yellow stripe. \nBud is staring.  Blinking.  The two wire look big as sewer pipes, and they're miles away... way down there where his hands are. \nThe only light he has left is a CYALUME STICK.  He pulls out the little plastic tube.  Breaks and shakes.  It starts to glow, a tiny wand of green light.  He fumbles with his tool pouch, takes out a pair of side-cutters. CUTING NNOW he types to them.  He reaches into the detonator. \nDETAIL, THE WIRES... in the green Cyalume glow, the look identical.  The cutters go over on wire.  A long beat.

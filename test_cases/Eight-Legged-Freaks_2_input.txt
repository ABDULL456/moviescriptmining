ARAC ATTACK! 
FADE IN: 
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 
A rabbit hops across rough terrain. 
EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT 
Three trucks from Chemical Technologies carry barrels of toxic waste. They pass a sign: PROSPERITY, NEVADA, POP 
INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT 
A sleepy trucker called PIG PEN drives the third truck. 
SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.) I will be self-assured and confident around women. 
PIG PEN I will be self-assured and confident around women. 
EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT 
The rabbit stops at the edge of the road. The first truck speeds past. Then the second. The rabbit crosses the highway in front of the third. 
INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT 
SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.) I will not fear the unexpected. 
PIG PEN I will not fear the unexpected. 
The rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights. 
PIG PEN Ahhhhhhhhhh! 
Pig Pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the bunny. 
EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT 
The truck slews crazily.    Missing the bunny by a whisker. 
INT. THIRD TRUCK (BRIDGE, DESERT) - NIGHT 
Pig Pen sees a bridge ahead. If he doesn't regain control, he will crash. At the last second, he gets the rig together. 
EXT. BRIDGE (DESERT) - THIRD TRUCK - NIGHT 
The rim of a wheel tags the curb. One of those toxic waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the water below. 
EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHT 
A biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips beneath the surface. Glowing toxic waste seeps from a gash in its side. Spreading through the pool like neon ink. 
EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY 
The ditch is littered with garbage. The DRONE of INSECTS. No visible traces of toxic waste. A butterfly net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized horsefly. 
JOSHUA TAFT (70s), scrutinizes the bug. This old codger is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with people. 
JOSHUA Hey, Mike.   Check this one out. 
MIKE PALMER (12) steps over for a look.     Puberty hit hard and fast for this bright, little nerd. 
MIKE He's huge! 
JOSHUA They've been like this all week. Must be something extra tasty in the water. 
MIKE Like what? 
JOSHUA Dead coyote. Snake maybe. Back in the 'Nam we'd eat python with a dash of habanero sauce. Mighty satisfying.

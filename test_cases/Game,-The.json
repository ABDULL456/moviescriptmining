{"train": "\"The Game\", early draft, by John Brancato & Michael Ferris \nThe Game \nby \nJohn Brancato & Michael Ferris \nREVISED October 19, 1995 \nA1. TITLES OVER \"HOME MOVIES\" from the 1960's -- FLICKERING, GRAINY, HAND-HELD, KODACHROME COLORS.  MUSIC OVER. \n1.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (HOME MOVIES) \nA SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BIRTHDAY BOY with a blindfold spins round and round, the HANDS of OTHER CHILDREN keep him spinning.  MAIN TITLE. It's a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey.  The dizzy boy is given a strip of felt, and the CAMERA follows as he stumbles toward a large cardboard donkey.  He pins the tail on its nose. \n2. QUICK, RAGGED CUTS-- the BOY blows out candles... opens gifts... a CLOWN ties balloon animals.  CHILDREN, MAIDS and BUTLERS hover about; there's even a real-live PONY.  The party take splace in the gardens of a massive Pacific Heights MANSION. \n3. THE BOY is SCHUYLER VAN ORTON (7), and this is his birthday party.  He's a serious-looking child, who adjusts his glasses as he poses for a shot with his mother, MRS. VAN ORTON, a stiff-looking society matron.  A NANNY brings over an INFANT and gently places the baby in Schuyler's arms.  Schuyler is ultra-careful, over- whelmed by the responsibility of holding his tiny BROTHER (DAVID). \n4. THE BOY and the other children sit spellbound, watching a magic show in the front GARDEN-- a MAGICIAN waves a colored handkerchief, a DOVE FLIES OUT.  CAMERA FOLLOWS the bird UP toward the house... \n5. THE CAMERA FINDS MR. VAN ORTON, a pinched, depressive man of about 40, wearing glasses.  He stands on a high balcony at the top story of the mansion, in a bathrobe, smoking a cigarette.  The unseen photographer ZOOMS IN jerkily on the man.  When he realizes he's being photographed, Mr. Van Orton turns his back and goes inside the house.  The film SOLARIZES and runs into LEADER-- \nCUT TO: \n6.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (PRESENT DAY) \nTITLES CONTINUE.  Early morning, the same mansion (ideally an ornate Victorian or Arts & Crafts).  The landscaping has changed, there are some modern touches, such as an iron gate surrounding the carriageway, a black 500-class MERCEDES in the drive. \nMUSIC DOWN, SEGUE to a CNN NEWS BROADCAST OVER as the CAMERA MOVES IN ON THE UPPER BALCONY where we'd seen Mr. Van Orton earlier... it's now COVERED and GLASSED-IN.  We move THROUGH THE GLASS... \n7.  I N T .   M A S T E R   B E D R O O M  -  D A Y \nTRACK THROUGH a large master bedroom; neat, masculine and Spartan, free weights, a treadmill.  Atop the bed a LAPTOP COMPUTER runs STOCK QUOTES.  A LARGE-SCREEN TV plays UNWATCHED, a familiar CNN ANCHOR (we'll assume BERNARD SHAW).  The Bang & Olufsen CLOCK RADIO CLICKS ON, 6:30 am; CLASSICAL MUSIC now DUELS with the TV report. HAND-ANNOTATED PAPERWORK and STOCK READOUTS cover a NIGHT TABLE, where the ringing multi-line TELEPHONE JOINS the cacophony. \nEND TITLES as we MOVE TOWARD a DOOR, it's open a crack-- from this adjacent bath we hear the SOUND OF A SHOWER RUNNING... \n8.  I N T .   M A S T E R   B A T H R O O M  -  D A Y \nIn the steam-filled bathroom, we make out SCHUYLER VAN ORTON, now 38.  He's handsome, fit and apparently in complete control of his world.  He steps out of the shower, wraps a towel around himself and grabs the BATHROOM PHONE. \nSCHUYLER (on phone) Van Orton... Yes, it is my birthday, Bob, is that why you called...?  Ah... No, I'm not carrying Alan Baer another inch, fuck him, BG Lumber is history... \nAs he speaks, he continues his morning ritual-- hair combing, Q- tips, etc.  (Schuyler is a man in almost constant motion.) \n9.  E X T.   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T S  -  D A Y \nThe black Mercedes moves quickly through morning traffic. \n10.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   C A R  -  D A Y \nSCHUYLER is on his car phone, NEWS RADIO LOW in BG, maneuvering aggressively through traffic.  His laptop RUNS in the passenger seat, its cellular antenna up. \nSCHUYLER (on carphone) Ignore the rumors, Alan, you know me, of course I'm behind Baer- Grace a hundred per cent... great, see you at the shareholders' meeting next month... \nHe hangs up and HONKS at another driver, displaying no emotion. \n11.  I N T .   V A N   O R T O N   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y \nTRACK WITH SCHUYLER through an elegant suite of offices.  He passes a discreet sign: \"THE VAN ORTON GROUP.\"  Schuyler is on a cell- phone, carrying the laptop, trailed by MARIA, his middle-aged secretary.  She bears paperwork and patiently awaits his attention. \nSCHUYLER (on cellphone) I've got buyers for the BG paper mill, goose the lawyers, final papers in three weeks... sure it's sad, but an old dog loses its teeth and pisses itself, you put it to sleep... \nAs Schuyler walks, he's GREETED by passing UNDERLINGS, whom he ignores.  He SHUTS OFF the phone, Maria hands him a couple of items, follows him into his office. \nMARIA Carol from the museum called. She's sending architect's sketches of the wing... \n12.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  D A Y \nThe office is large, tasteful, reeks of old money.  A window overlooks the San Francisco skyline and the Bay. \nMARIA That Business Week reporter called again-- \nSCHUYLER Tell him to fuck himself.  Nicely. \nMARIA (awkwardly) --and, um, somebody who identified himself as, um, P.P. Willy. \nSCHUYLER FREEZES at this, stares at her. \nMARIA Sorry, I figured it was a crank, but he swore you'd know who he was.  He wanted to meet you for lunch, I told him you had appointments all-- \nSCHUYLER Cancel.  Cancel the whole afternoon. \nMARIA But you-- \nSCHUYLER Do it.  Did he leave a number? \nMARIA No.  He just said he'd be at Leo's in the Haight.  At noon. \nMaria hands him a slip of paper, lingers, awaiting explanation... \nSCHUYLER That's all, Maria. \nShe heads out quickly.  Schuyler stares at the slip, then turns to look out the window, lost in thought. \nShe moves off as Schuyler tries to order, raising a finger-- \nSCHUYLER Just a cheesebur... how'd you find this place? \nDAVID Old connection used to meet me here.  So you gonna call 'em? \nSCHUYLER (a sigh, carefully) You know, David, this is sweet, but it's an awfully busy time, I'm in the midst of a delicate liquidation-- \nDAVID (mimicking him bitterly) \"A delicate liquidation,\" God, you would do this... \nSCHUYLER David-- \nDAVID We can't get together once without you making me feel like shit.  That's important to you, isn't it? \nSCHUYLER What are you talking about? \nDAVID Forget about it, don't bother. \nDavid slumps in his seat, won't meet Schuyler's eyes. \nSCHUYLER Are you still on medication...? \nDavid glares at him.  With the impeccable timing of all waitresses, CHRISTINE appears, chipper. \nCHRISTINE You guys know what you want? \nDAVID Go away. \nShe curls her lip and departs before Schuyler can open his mouth. He sighs, resigned to the idea of not eating.  Calmly: \nDAVID I just thought you'd like it.  I did, it was a blast, best thing that ever happened to me.  And for your information, I'm not on anything anymore, I'm not even seeing a shrink, I'm in a better place than I've ever been, I'm even happy-- but that's something else I wouldn't be able to explain to you. \nSCHUYLER OK, OK, I'll give them a call... \nDAVID Whatever. \nSCHUYLER Look, take a pill.  Just be normal for thirty seconds and tell me what this is.  I hate surprises. \nDAVID I know. \nDavid WINKS, puts a finger to his lips-- not another word. \nCLOSE as Schuyler slips the brightly-colored CARD into his pocket. \nCUT TO: \n14.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   O F F I C E   B U I L D I N G  -  N I G H T \nESTABLISH the moonlit exterior of an older, classy building in downtown San Francisco.  MOVE IN on a high window, one of the few LIT at this hour.  We hear the SOUND OF A PHONE CHIRPING OVER. \nlS.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  N I G H T \nCOMPUTERS run, stacks of PAPERWORK, etc. PHONE continues to RING. \nFIND SCHUYLER as he punches the SPEAKER: \nSCHUYLER Van Orton. \nELIZABETH (on speaker) Hello, Schuyler. \nELIZABETH is Schuyler's ex-wife-- an earnest woman, a stranger to subtlety.  STAY WITH SCHUYLER, who half-smiles, looks at his watch. \nSCHUYLER Eleven forty, you almost didn't make it. \nELIZABETH (on speaker) I always call on your birthday. How was it? \nSCHUYLER Oh, the usual, big party, circus clowns, naked lady in a cake... \nELIZABETH (on speaker) (slight chuckle; serious) How are you, Sky? \nShe has the concerned, forthright tone of a \"recovery person,\" someone who's been through a lot of therapy and wants to reach out. Schuyler GRIMACES, then mimics the tone: \nSCHUYLER I'm just fine.  How are you? \nELIZABETH (on speaker) It wasn't a trick question. Thirty-eight, I thought that might be a-- a difficult year for you... \nSCHUYLER Hm?  Just another birthday, another year closer to death. \nELIZABETH (on speaker) I meant-- because of your father. \nSCHUYLER Oh that's right, I guess he was 38, wasn't he?  I hadn't thought about it, to tell the truth, but thank you for the reminder. \nELIZABETH (on speaker) Why do I call you... \nSCHUYLER I honestly don't know, but it's a nice change of pace from talking to your attorneys.  So, still working at the hospice? \nELIZABETH (on speaker) Mm-hmm, couple days a week... \nSCHUYLER Great, that's great.  Well, give my regards to Dr. Mel and the baby-- \nELIZABETH (on speaker) She has a little brother on the way... we just did the ultrasound. \nSCHUYLER Really.  Congratulations-- two kids, an official nuclear family, you must be very happy. \nELIZABETH (on speaker) We are, Sky.  Very happy. \nWHAM, a BALL SLAMS against a wall. \nTHROUGH A WINDOW, we see SCHUYLER playing violently, pumping sweat... he's alone.  We hear the sound of a PHONE CALL OVER: \nSCHUYLER (V. O.) David, where the hell are you, we were supposed to meet at the club-- \nDAVID (V. O.) Oh, shit, sorry Sky, I spaced-- next Tuesday? \nSCHUYLER (V. O.) I'll be in Seattle. \nDAVID (V. O.) Buy you lunch soon as you get back, I swear... \nFed up with playing alone, Schuyler lets the ball bounce, exits the court and heads for a LOCKER ROOM down the hall... \nSCHUYLER (V. O.) I checked out CRS by the way-- \nDAVID (V. O.) Hey, great, you gonna go for it? \nSCHUYLER (V. O.) Haven't decided yet... \nS C E N E   3 6   D E L E T E D \n37(NEW).  E X T .   C O U N T R Y   C L U B   B A R  -  D A Y \nSCHUYLER, in casual clothes, hair still wet from a shower, comes out of a locker room area toward an outdoor BAR by a SWIMMING POOL at this upscale country ciub.  He passes PETE and JOHN, two middle- aged RICH MEN sitting at a table near the bar; he overhears a snippet of their conversation-- \nJOHN --like fuckin' wildfire, just opened an office in Frisco here-- \nPETE I played my game in New York... What do you think John, will CRS ever go public? \nJOHN (laughs) Not likely, would you? \nSchuyler slows down, eavesdropping, then moves toward the bar, addresses the BARTENDER with a nod toward John and Pete. \nSCHUYLER New members? \nBARTENDER I believe so. \nSCHUYLER This round's on me. \nSchuyler moves casually toward the men-- \nDISSOLVE TO: \n38(N). SAME LOCATION, LATER, the bartender brings another round of drinks to the table, Schuyler and the men have been chatting a while, all seem relaxed.  Pete, the friendlier (drunker) of the two, puffs a CIGAR as he speaks: \nPETE ...last time I played Pebble, I swore I'd never pick up a club again... \nThe others CHUCKLE knowingly.  Schuyler sips his drink, blinking and coughing discretely at the smoke; there's a slight pause. \nSCHUYLER Great thing about golf, the way it takes you out of your life... Speaking of games-- I take it you two are familiar with CRS...? \nJOHN Uh-oh.  Time to piss... \nHe slides off his stool.  Pete studies Schuyler, sizing him up. \nPETE Why do you ask, Schuyler? \nSCHUYLER I couldn't help overhearing-- \nPETE We don't usually talk about it. \nSCHUYLER I only bring it up because, well, I recently tested for it. \nPETE Did you?  Kudos. \nSCHUYLER I just wasn't sure if they're for real, whether it's worth it-- \nPETE Worth it... Gee, I dunno... they did save my fucking life... \nSCHUYLER Sorry? \nPETE Look, I don't know you, you don't know me, but... I hit a certain point, nothing meant anything.  My work, the wife and kids-- hell with 'em, I was sick of it all, y'know?  But CRS... they changed everything.  \"Are they for real?\"  Who cares, maybe nothing is. (raises his glass) To reality. \nSchuyler raises his glass, numbed by this outpouring.  Pete drains his drink, chuckling to himself.  His friend comes back, looking concerned, takes the man's arm. \nJOHN C'mon Pete. \nPETE (winks at Schuyler) Good luck, pal.  You'll need it. \nSchuyler stares after the two men dubiously as they move off. \nCUT TO: \n39.  I N T .   L A W   F I R M   C O N F E R E N C E   R O O M  -  D A Y \nA slick, designery conference room, filled with BABBLING LAWYERS-- at the head of the table stands BOB PLYMPTON, a trustworthy man in his late 50's.  MURMURING CONTINUES during Plympton's address. \nPLYMPTON Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Postponing the Baer-Grace meeting is out of the question.  Schuyler gets on a plane for Washington tomorrow morning at seven with every contract, every side agreement, the complete closing package! \nSchuyler has been going through paperwork in the back of the room, he steps forward during the above. \nLAWYER But there's simply no-- \nTHWAP!  Schuyler DROPS the stack of papers on the table, SILENCE. \nThis gets Schuyler's attention, he squints toward the television. \nBERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) The U. S. geological service has detected a massive disturbance in the earth's crust deep beneath the northern segment of the San Andreas fault... \nSCHUYLER scrambles for his glasses, as Shaw struggles to continue. \nBERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) ...they have issued a warning that a major earthquake of magnitude eight or greater is likely to hit the San Francisco Bay area within... (a beat) Oh my God, the next fifteen minutes-- \nSCHUYLER sits on the bed, breathes hard, stares at the tube. \nBERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) There is no time for an evacuation. The federal government has issued the following instructions for all residents of central and northern California... \nSCHUYLER is freaking out, paces frantically, moves toward a phone-- who's he going to call?  He makes a low MOAN. \nSHAW'S voice CRACKS, he speaks very rapidly. \nBERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) Locate emergency shut-offs for all power and gas-- \nSCHUYLER starts moving out of the room-- \nBERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) Wait, there's no time for that-- just stay away from windows and doors-- \nSCHUYLER doubles back, avoiding a window, his panic mounting-- \nBERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV) Find a heavy piece of furniture such as a desk or table and get under it-- \nSCHUYLER looks around, sees no such appropriate spot in the room. \nBERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV) If no such furniture is immediately available, go to a window or doorway-- \nSCHUYLER blinks, hesitates starts to move toward the doar-- \nBERNARD sHAW (cant., on TV) But first turn off all power and gas. Crouch in a comfortable position, put your head between your knees and cover it with your arms-- \nSCHUYLER, confused, crouches as instructed-- \nBERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV) Then KISS YOUR LILY-WHITE ASS GOODBYE! \nOn this last line, Shaw's voice starts to ECHO and CHANGE. \nSCHUYLER rises, staring at the TV, mouth agape. \nSHAW WINKS.  His VOICE is utterly transformed. \nBERNARD SHAW (on TV) Howdy Sky. \nHIS FACE RIPPLES and MORPHS into a SKULL, it's becoming clear that this is a computer-generated Bernard shaw. \nCYBERSHAW (on TV) Que pasa? \nAs CYBERSHAW speaks, his face will continue to transform, sometimes back to a recognizable human state, other times into abstract images, a talking piano, a dog, etc. \nCYBERSHAW (on TV) Welcome to the Game! Congratulations on your decision to let Consumer Recreation Services entertain you. \nThe combination of relief, amazement and anger is a bit much for Schuyler to absorb.  Smiling sickly: \nSCHUYLER Fuckers! \nCYBERSHAW (on TV) This might be a good time to lay out a few ground rules, help you enjoy your adventure.  You've received the first key.  There will be others. Pay attention-- you never know where you'll find 'em, you never know when you'll need 'em, so keep 'em with you at all times... \nAs he speaks, Schuyler reaches for the gold key on his bedside table.  He starts putting it onto his keychain. \nON TV SCREEN-- below CyberShaw, a PHONE NUMBER SCROLLS PAST. \nCYBERSHAW (on TV) You might want to write this number down, it's the CRS hotline, operators are standing by to assist... but please don't call to ask what the object of the game is-- figuring that out is the object of the game... \nSCHUYLER has snatched up the CRS pen to write down the number-- it doesn't work.  SWEARING, he tosses it aside, grabs another. \nON TV, CyberShaw MORPHS back into the original Bernard Shaw. There's a quick VISUAL GLITCH on the tube as the original TV feed resumes-- Bernard Shaw is delivering a normal news story. \nBERNARD SHAW (on TV) --reaction on wall Street was muted following the Fed's announcement of... \nSCHUYLER is taken with the display of electronic pyrotechnics, in spite of himself.  He hits the speaker button on his phone, dials. \nOPERATOR VOICE (filter) You've reached CRS... \nSCHUYLER Yeah, this is pretty impressive but listen-- \nOPERATOR VOICE (filter) Our office is closed.  Please call back during business hours. (BEEP) \nSCHUYLER My name is Schuyler Van Orton, my game just started.  Look, this is a bad time, I'm about to leave town-- \nA DIAL TONE, CRS doesn't take messages.  Schuyler sighs, HANGS UP. \n44.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T \nSCHUYLER crouches by a coaxial cable line emerging from the side of the house.  He fingers a box with a miniature LOOP and RABBIT EAR ANTENNA that's been spliced into the line with a tiny S-shaped WIRE.  He starts to unscrew it, then thinks twice, heads back in. \nWIDER, as Schuyler enters his mansion, a GIBBOUS MOON OVERHEAD. \nCUT TO: \n45.  E X T .   S E A - T A C   A I R P O R T  -  D A Y \nMist in the air, a jet taxis to a terminal. \nSCHUYLER Never mind... we'll just have to go with the earlier draft. \nIn BG, one exec picks up a page, WHISPERS to an ASSISTANT, who moves out of the room.  Schuyler moves to his briefcase.  It's LOCKED.  He starts patting his pockets. \nBAER Can't find your keys? \nBaer has a malevolent expression.  Schuyler looks at him. \nSCHUYLER Where are they. \nBAER Up your ass? \nA couple of execs stifle chuckles.  Schuyler's suspicions mount. \nSCHUYLER Up my ass, very funny... \nHis eyes drift to a piece of CORPORATE STATIONARY on the table in front of him.  He picks it up: \nINSERT - UNDER BAER-GRACE LETTERHEAD we see a handscrawled note: \"CRS CALLED.\"  We don't see what's written below. \nSCHUYLER is reeling, paranoia confirmed. \nSCHUYLER I don't-- OK.  OK, you're with CRS... \nBaer stares at him blankly.  Schuyler puts a hand over his eyes, seems disoriented, trying to piece it all together. \nSCHUYLER So the game, it's just a screen, to blow this deal... \nBAER I'm not following you. \nSCHUYLER Like hell you aren't.  How did you get my brother involved, that's unforgivable. \nThe assembled execs are looking at Schuyler in utter confusion.  As he speaks, the ASSISTANT returns with some PAPERWORK.  Schuyler stares at him menacingly.  Hesitantly: \nASSISTANT Um... sorry to interrupt.  We've been having some trouble with this fax, so they re-sent the material. It's all OK now. \nThe assistant comes over, cheerfully places the crucial documents in front of Schuyler.  The assistant fishes in his pocket. \nASSISTANT Oh and Mr. Van Orton-- are these yours?  The pilot found 'em on the floor of the chopper... \nSchuyler gingerly takes the KEYS which the assistant holds out, looks from them to the paperwork.  Then he glances back at the handwritten note on the table: \nINSERT NOTE:  It actually reads \"CBS CALLED.\"  (Schuyler's thumb or a Post-It note covered the base of the B before, making it look like an R.)  It continues \"Re: Interview with Alan B. on Sun...\" \nSCHUYLER takes a breath, reassembles his composure and consults his watch.  He rises, anxious to put the last few minutes behind him. \nSCHUYLER Everything seems to be in order. Please disregard my last comments. The shareholders meeting is about to get underway... Shall we? \nHe heads for the door.  As he leaves, the execs exchange looks. \nCUT TO: \n51.  I N T .   S E A - T A C   T E R M I N A L  -  N I G H T \nSchuyler wanders through the terminal, carrying his bags, glancing periodically at the DEPARTURES monitor and the clock.  His manner now has changed, he eyes every PASSERBY, especially the ODD ONES. \nP. A. VOICE (filter) Flight 177 to San Francisco is now boarding at Gate 14... \nSuddenly a leg is thrust out from behind an advertising kiosk, Schuyler TRIPS and goes sprawling.  The Rasta Man steps out, now wearing SUNGLASSES with PINK LENSES. \nRASTA MAN Shit mon sorry oughta pay more attention. \nSchuyler gets up, dusts himself off.  As calmly as possible: \nSCHUYLER Listen, I quit. \nRASTA MAN Free at last... you won't be needin' this, then. \nHe snatches up the briefcase, dances back a few paces.  Schuyler speaks as if to a child. \nSCHUYLER No, cretin.  I'm quitting the game. \nThe rasta man keeps backing away, puts a hand to his ear. \nRASTA MAN Wha's that, mon?  I didna hear you. \nSchuyler is pursuing the man, walking faster and faster. \nSCHUYLER I said I-- shit! \nThe rasta turns and RUNS, Schuyler bolts after him, unable to believe this is happening.  They draw a lot of looks during the brief chase through the terminal, the suited businessman, garment bag flapping behind him, in pursuit of the crazy rasta. \nRASTA MAN Help, help!  The mon is crazy! \nHe runs into a MEN'S ROOM, Schuyler follows a moment later. \n52.  I N T .   A I R P O R T   M E N ' S   R O O M  -  N I G H T \nSchuyler has the rasta cornered now-- but he doesn't have the briefcase.  Both are out of breath.  PISSING MEN look wary. \nSCHUYLER Where is it? \nRASTA MAN Got something better. \nThe rasta men holds out a SHINY KEY on a chain.  Schuyler narrows his eyes, he's trying not to lose control of his temper. \n63.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  N I G H T \nSchuyler emerges, shoes in hand. \nSCHUYLER Basically.  Beats working, huh? \nChristine sits on his desk, with her bag slung over her shoulder, eating an APPLE.  She slides off the desk, flirting rather bluntly. \nCHRISTINE You don't look so bad, without the tie. \nSCHUYLER Look, I hope you haven't been too put out... I could probably get you another job, I have a stake in a couple of restaurants-- \nCHRISTINE I'm not much of a waitress, really. Y'know, today's been kind of-- \nSCHUYLER Can you type? \nCHRISTINE Kind of a turn-on, you know? (getting no response) I didn't mean-- just, the danger... Like fucking in a graveyard. \nSCHUYLER Mm.  So where do you live? \nChristine realizes her come-on is falling flat, she pulls back, tossing her unfinished apple in the trash. \nCHRISTINE Out in Concord, with my folks, unfortunately.  They're never gonna believe that I've been hanging out with a guy like you. \nSCHUYLER What do you mean? \nCHRISTINE Nothing, just-- most of the guys I see have tats, y'know? (off his confused look) Tattoos... \nSCHUYLER Of course.  We'd better head downstairs, the limo's waiting. \nChristine nods disappointedly as Schuyler moves to the door. \nCUT TO: \n64.  I N T .   L I M O  -  N I G H T \nSchuyler and Christine ride in silence in the back seat. \nCHRISTINE Mind if I smoke in here? \nSCHUYLER Yes. (leaning forward) Up here on the left. \nAs the limo pulls over, he and Christine turn to each other.  It's a somewhat awkward moment. \nCHRISTINE So what's our next move?  I mean, in the game.  Obviously we need to figure out what that crank thing is for-- \nSCHUYLER I'm not playing anymore. \nCHRISTINE (disappointed) Why not? \nSCHUYLER I have a life.  Jack'll take you home, or wherever you want to go. \nCHRISTINE Yeah, maybe I'll get in a little ballroom dancing before bed-- \nThe limo has stopped now.  Schuyler has started to open the door. \nCHRISTINE Wait, what about your clothes? \nSCHUYLER Forget it. \nCHRISTINE C'mon it's a brand new sweatshirt. \nSo saying, she pulls it off.  She's wearing a black bra... a ROSE is tattooed on her shoulder.  Schuyler can't help but react.  She thrusts the shirt at him, he's half out of the car. \nSCHUYLER No, it's not-- just-- back from the cleaners. \nCHRISTINE (throatily) You dry clean your sweatshirts... \nHe nods slightly... as he reaches to take it-- \n--CHRISTINE leans forward, cups the back of his head and gives him a LONG, HARD KISS. \nJACK THE DRIVER, middle-aged and trustworthy, turns and catches a glimpse of this, quickly turns away. \nCHRISTINE breaks the kiss, sinks back against the red leather seat, waiting for Schuyler to make the next move. \nCHRISTINE See ya. \nSchuyler nods again, torn.  She's looking at him expectantly.  He's clearly aroused, but this is such an inappropriate female.  Sadly, he waves a hand. \nSCHUYLER Good night. \n65.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  N I G H T \nSchuyler shuts the door, sweatshirt in hand, the dome light slowly DIMS OUT out on the crestfallen Christine-- we see her mouth a CURSE.  Schuyler moves toward his MBZ, the limo IDLING.  He's about to get inside when he sees a TICKET IN AN ENVELOPE under the windshield wiper.  He SNORTS-- insult to injury-- tosses it on the dash as he climbs in. \n66.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T \nHe sits behind the wheel, watching the lights of the limo disappear.  He sniffs the sweatshirt a moment, then STARTS at the sound of a MOTOR STARTING across the street. \nANGLE THROUGH SIDE WINDOW-- an MBZ the same year, model and color as Schuyler's-- pulls away from the curb, Schuyler gets a glimpse of something REFLECTING STREET LIGHT in the window of the car-- a gun?  A camera with a long lens?  The car makes a quick U-turn and drives in the same direction as the limo. \nSCHUYLER, curious, STARTS THE ENGINE as if to pursue.  Then he glimpses the envelope on the dash out of the corner of his eye.  He doesn't put the car in gear, picks up the envelope instead... \nCLOSE ON ENVELOPE-- The words \"OPEN ME\" are printed in BLOCK LETTERS on the outside.  He opens it quickly-- there's no ticket inside, but he shakes out a RAINBOW-COLORED CONDOM in a clear wrapper and a NOTE in KIDNAPPER LETTERS:  \"BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY.\" \nSCHUYLER (grabbing him) I can't!  Listen to me-- \nDAVID Fuck you! \nDavid SLUGS HIM in the face, Schuyler staggers back, clutches his BLEEDING nose.  David runs, full tilt, into the woods near the Japanese Tea Garden. \nSCHUYLER pursues amidst the trees and vegetation, running out of breath, calling after David, who's vanished.  He leans against a tree, PANTING, dabbing at his bleeding nose with a SCRAP OF TISSUE from his pocket.  He hears a PHONE RINGING, moves toward it, emerging through bushes near the ACADEMY OF SCIENCE... \nHe pauses at the RINGING PAYPHONE.  He decides not to pick it up, looking around at the deserted MUSEUM BUILDINGS and hurrying toward civilization.  He passes other PAYPHONES en route to the park exit... each one STARTS RINGING as he approaches it.  He moves faster, freaked.  At the edge of the park, he snatches one up-- \nSCHUYLER (on phone) What have you done to my brother, you bastards?!  This is over, I'm not playing anymore-- (beat) Hello, is anyone there-- \nPHONE VOICE If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and dial again-- if you need help-- \nSCHUYLER slams the phone down.  He dabs his nose one more time, tosses the paper scrap into the trash. \nCLOSE ON SCRAP-- \"CRS\" with the emergency NUMBER, the blue ink has BLED with the rain and Schuyler's BLOOD... \nSCENE 75 DELETED \n76(NEW).  E X T .   F U L T O N   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T \nPOV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD, as Schuyler emerges from the park.  The car suddenly MOVES FORWARD-- \nWITH SCHUYLER.  He walks to the curb, distractedly raises a hand for a cab, which pulls up instantly.  He climbs in. \n77.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T \nAn aged, battered CAB; PLEXIGLAS between the CABBIE and the back. \nSCHUYLER Six three six Mission, please. \nThe cabbie nods and hits the gas. \n78.  E X T .   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T \nThe cab roars down the street, KICKING UP WATER from the gutters. \n79.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T \nSchuyler bites his cuticle, not watching where they're going; the windows are wet and fogged.  Then he looks out, narrows his eyes and RAPS on the PLEXIGLAS PARTITION. \nSCHUYLER You're heading the wrong way. \nCABBIE (filter) Relax, pal, you'll get where you're going. \nThe cabbie turns IN PROFILE for a moment.  He appears to be wearing a HEARING AID, a round piece of plastic, a tiny WIRE disappearing into his shirt.  And there's something familiar about his face. Schuyler glances at the driver ID on the back of the seat-- \nCLOSE ON PHOTO, the man is the RASTA from the airport, with a new hairdo.  The COMPANY NAME-- \"CONSOLIDATED REGENCY SEDANS.\"  CRS. \nSCHUYLER rubs his head, very angry. \nSCHUYLER Why are you doing this-- \nCABBIE/RASTA (filter) We do it all for you!  We're the best friends you got, no one ever worked so hard to make you feel alive... but you gotta let it happen... \nThe cab STOPS at a RED LIGHT.  SCHUYLER tries the doorhandle-- it doesn't work. \n80.  E X T .   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T  -  N I G H T \nThe cab PEELS OUT when the light turns green, heads for a pier. \n81.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T \nSchuyler looks around in increasing panic. \nSCHUYLER What the fuck is this-- \nCABBIE/RASTA Have a nice day... \nThe cabbie opens his own door and leaps out of the MOVING CAB-- \n82.  E X T .   W H A R F  -  N I G H T \nThe cabbie/rasta hits the ground and ROLLS in a perfect stunt fall. The cab rockets to the end of the disused wharf and-- \n--GOES FLYING off the edge into the San Francisco Bay, illuminated by SPOTLIGHTS from the end of the wharf. \n83.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T \nSchuyler SCREAMS as the cab plunges and HITS the water. \n84.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T \nThe STEAMING cab's nose slowly DIPS below the surface. \n85.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T \nFILLING WITH WATER from the car's floor, from overhead.  EERIE LIGHT from the front of the cab.  Schuyler tries to roll down the window, the handle SPINS, nothing happens. \n86.  E X T .   B A Y  -  N I G H T \nThe cab GOES UNDER with a BURBLE of BUBBLES. \n87.  I N T .   C A B  -  N I G H T \nGIRL They said you'd figure out what to do with it. \nSCHUYLER takes it from her gingerly, undoes the bow, opens the lid: \nANGLE IN COFFIN-- an ornate HATCHET with a KEY DESIGN on the blade. \nSCHUYLER REMOVES it from its QUILTED resting place.  THE GIRL backs away, nervous to see SCHUYLER with a weapon. \nSCHUYLER I'm supposed to carry a fucking hatchet around...?  Relax.  I don't want it. \nHe drops the AXE and the COFFIN into the water with a SPLASH-- \n95PT. THEY GO UNDER and DISAPPEAR... \nCUT TO: \n96.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  D A Y \nEarly morning, the RAIN has stopped-- a RAINBOW arcs behind the office building.  TWO COP CARS, marked and unmarked, pull up at the curb, lights FLASHING. \n97.  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y  -  D A Y \nSchuyler, in the clothes from the boat, and Plympton, his lawyer, are joined at the elevators by two plainclothes detectives-- BARNETT and GALLO-- and two UNIFORMS. \nPLYMPTON Thank you for your promptness, officers.  I'm Robert Plympton, Mr. Van Orton's attorney-- \nSCHUYLER Let's go.  Seventh floor. \n98.  I N T .   C R S   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y \nSchuyler enters, followed by the others.  He stops short, reacts. WIDE SHOT reveals-- the same offices, now entirely empty.  The partitions, the desks, everything has been removed.  A small amount of TRASH is scattered on the floor-- the move was evidently hasty. \nCUT TO: \n99. LATER.  UNIFORM #1 SPEAKS into his walkie-talkie, COP TALK; #2 pokes around in a box full of SHREDDED PAPER; Plympton CONFERS with Barnett, nods, then both of them cross to Schuyler, who sits on the carpet, back to an empty wall.  Barnett checks his notes. \nBARNETT Management company for the building said this floor hasn't been rented.  We checked with the Secretary of State and the county recorder, there's no listing of a \"consumer research service.\" \nPLYMPTON Recreation service. \nBARNETT Right.  No sign of the boat or the girl.  Divers got the cab's vehicle ID, the company junked it a month ago. \nGallo, who'd been talking on a phone IN BG, approaches. \nGALLO The numbers you gave us are disconnected, sir, this was the only address the phone company had.  And we found your car-- it's in impound. \nBARNETT I'm a little confused as to motive here.  You said your brother sent you to these people... \nSCHUYLER It's not his fault, he's unstable, he didn't know what he was doing-- \nBARNETT And they were supposed to show you a, a good time? \nGALLO (a cautioning look at Barnett) My guess is this Feingold guy's using an alias... is there anything else you can tell us about him? \nSchuyler spots an empty CHINESE FOOD CARTON crumpled in the corner. \nCLOSER as SCHUYLER picks up and fingers the container-- Chinese characters on it, the name TUNG HOY. \nSCHUYLER He likes Chinese food... \nBARNETT Don't worry, Mr. Van Orton, we'll get these jokers. \nSCHUYLER nods, unconvinced. \nCUT TO: \n100(NEW).  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   M A N S I O N  -  D A Y \nPLYMPTON pulls up in his LEXUS, SCHUYLER gets out wearily. \nPLYMPTON There's clearly a civil case once we locate the defendant... \nSCHUYLER Whatever. \nPLYMPTON Y'know, Sky, things are quiet since the closing-- you could take some time off. \nSCHUYLER sighs and nods, closes the car door and waves good-bye. He climbs the steps to his front door and Plympton pulls away. \n101(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   F O Y E R  -  D A Y \nSCHUYLER enters and automatically reaches for a LIGHTSWITCH-- \nBLUE SPARKS leap to his fingers, the switch has been RIPPED OUT, leaving exposed WIRING. \nSCHUYLER CURSES and shakes his hand out.  He looks around in disbelief-- the walls are covered in GRAFFITI. \n\"GAME OVER\" is the first one we see in the foyer, above the HARLEQUIN, who still sits in the only upright chair... but now a GLOSSY BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO is stuck in its teeth. \nSCHUYLER pulls out the picture, looks at it, hand trembling-- \nA POLICE PHOTO of MR. VAN ORTON, his body sprawled in a pool of blood.  It's stamped \"PROPERTY SFPD\" in red... \nSCHUYLER Oh, God-- \nSCHUYLER tosses the picture aside, moves into his living room-- \nDESK CLERK Mr. Van Orton.  Here's your credit card... and the maid found this under the bed... \nFrom under the desk he removes a small ATTACHE CASE, places it gingerly in front of Schuyler. \nSCHUYLER That isn't mine. \nDESK CLERK It has your initials on it, sir. \nSCHUYLER examines the case closely for the first time, sees the gold monogram, \"S. V. O.\" \nDESK CLERK We'd just as soon you took it with you, in any event... and in the future, you might consider choosing another hotel for your... \nThe man trails off and moves away. \nSCHUYLER I've never been here before in my life! \nThe man ignores him now.  Schuyler pockets his credit card, thinks a beat, then grabs the briefcase. \nSCENES 103-104 DELETED \n105.  I N T .   C O M P A N Y   L I M O  -  D A Y \nJACK drives, Schuyler in back, studying the open briefcase in his lap.  He seems extremely upset, fighting to maintain his wits... \nSCHUYLER Jack... the woman you took home the other night, where did you go? \nJACK (puzzled) Out to Concord... \nSCHUYLER I know, what was the address? \nJACK is a bit nervous, he doesn't want to piss off the boss. \nJACK Mmm... it was... Beulah Drive, I think, yeah, offa Oakdale... but didn't you-- never mind. \nSCHUYLER What? \nJACK Just-- I thought you followed us there.  There was a black 500SE behind us the whole way, I just assumed... \nSCHUYLER Shit.  Shit!  It wasn't me, Jack. \nJACK Of course, sir.  It was a white house, I remember... big tree in the front... with one of those, you know, tire swings... \nSCHUYLER Jack, I'm serious.  It wasn't me. \nJACK It wasn't you, sir. \nSchuyler looks at the man, who stares straight ahead, not believing him for a second.  Schuyler shakes his head, looks down at the open briefcase in his lap. \nANGLE IN BRIEFCASE-- a set of HANDCUFFS, assorted BONDAGE GEAR... and a few BLURRY POLAROID PHOTOS, showing a NAKED WOMAN with a LEATHER MASK chained to a bed.  ONE SHOT shows her shoulder clearly-- we see a ROSE TATTOO. \nCUT TO: \n106.  E X T .   I M P O U N D   L O T  -  D A Y \nA female IMPOUND WORKER with paperwork leads SCHUYLER through a maze of SMASHED CARS, etc.  IN BG, the COMPANY LIMO pulls away. \nIMPOUND WORKER Triple A changed your tire... bad blow-out was it?  Anyone hurt? \nSchuyler shakes his head.  They've reached his MBZ. \nIMPOUND WORKER Oh.  Just... we were a little curious about the mess in the back... \nSCHUYLER bends down to look in the window. \nHIS POV-- THE BACKSEAT has been SLASHED.  A few SPLASHES OF BLOOD, not too much.  Schuyler's HARVARD SWEATSHIRT is torn and STAINED with blood, crumpled in a corner of the seat. \nSCHUYLER swallows, recovers quickly. \nSCHUYLER A friend's dog-- he'd been hit by a car, I drove him to the vet... (as the cop nods slowly) Golden retriever, beautiful animal. \nIMPOUND WORKER (handing Sky a receipt) He OK? \nSCHUYLER Too early to say. \nHe quickly gets behind the wheel. \nCUT TO: \nSCENE 107 DELETED \n108.  E X T .

He parks the Benz.  A WHITE VAN is parked just up the street, a LOOP AND RABBIT EAR on the roof.  PAN to show THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR... A cartoonish logo with the CRS MAN holding a wrench by a TV SET in front of a RAINBOW, the words \"CABLE REPAIR SPECIALISTS.\" \nON THE HOUSE, MOVE from a WHITEWALL TIRE hanging on a rope from a tree to SCHUYLER as he RINGS the front doorbell of a WHITE HOUSE. \nAT THE DOOR, an older, working-class man in a T-shirt appears-- Christine's dad, MR. KAMINSKY. \nMR. KAMINSKY Yes? \nSCHUYLER Mr. Kaminsky?  Schuyler Van Orton-- \nMR. KAMINSKY Is that a name?  Look, I'm kinda busy. (starts to close the door) \nSCHUYLER You have a daughter named Christine?  I'm afraid she might be in danger. \nShe kisses him, he doesn't open his mouth, neither shuts their eyes.  Then she gets up quickly, moves to a corner of the room. \nCHRISTINE (back in character, accented) OK, I know a good place we could go and like, be alone... \nShe glances up quickly to indicate something on the ceiling-- \nON CEILING, a large SMOKE DETECTOR with a RED LIGHT, a cable from it-- there's a small LENS in the center... A HIDDEN CAMERA. \nSCHUYLER looks at this, starting to rise.  She moves to a window, out of range of the camera, beckons him over. \nCHRISTINE It's a beautiful night, isn't it? \nSchuyler comes up beside her, she nods for him to look outside-- \nPOV-- THROUGH WINDOW-- the CRS VAN.  Christine WHISPERS urgently: \nCHRISTINE There's four of them in the van, they're armed.  Just play along, I'll get us out of here-- \nSCHUYLER turns to her, his voice is tired. \nSCHUYLER Fuck you. (to surveillance camera) OK, that's it, game over-- \n112.  I N T .   C R S   V A N  -  N I G H T \nCLOSE on a video monitor, Schuyler framed in a FISHEYE SHOT: \nSCHUYLER (FILTER) --you can come out now, assholes-- \nHe moves toward the front door, a panicked Christine behind him-- \nRASTA MAN'S VOICE We're blown, let's do it-- \nWe hear MEN GETTING TO THEIR FEET, see BODIES MOVE in FG. \n113.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  N I G H T \nChristine's furious and terrified, dashes in front of him, LOCKS and THROWS A CHAIN across the front door. \nCHRISTINE You idiot!  Come on! \nShe starts to pull him away from the door, he throws off her arm. \nSCHUYLER No, enough already.  I've had it. \nHe goes to the window and opens the curtain. \nTHROUGH WINDOW-- the Hack/Cabbie, the Rasta/Pilot and a pair of CRS AGENTS (JOHN and PETER from the men's club) hurry toward the house, the older men reach inside their jackets-- \nSCHUYLER Now what. \nCHRISTINE Get away from there!! \nSCHUYLER (steps toward her) Oh, now I suppose they're going to-- \nTHE WINDOWS BLOW IN, GUNFIRE, Christine TACKLES HIM and pulls him to the ground as-- \nKNICK-KNACKS fly to pieces directly behind where he was standing. \nCHRISTINE AND SCHUYLER keep low as they dash for the kitchen-- \nSCHUYLER Holy shit!! \n114.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   K I T C H E N  -  N I G H T \nChristine pulls him toward a basement door-- \n115.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   G A R A G E  -  N I G H T \nThey dash down steps to the darkened one-car garage, mostly empty with a few random tools.  MR. KAMINSKY looks up from a game of SOLITAIRE, a day player confused by the sudden commotion. \nSCHUYLER What is this!? \nCHRISTINE God, wake up, it's a con game! \nTHE GARAGE DOOR OPENS, Christine pulls Schuyler against a wall-- \nA \"PARAMEDIC\" charges out of the shadows, pulling a handgun-- \nIN BG MR. KAMINSKY dives for cover with a frightened NOISE-- \nCHRISTINE grabs a WRENCH and CLUBS THE PARAMEDIC, who falls with a CRY, clutching his skull.  They hear FOOTSTEPS on the stairs they just came down.  Christine hustles the dazed Schuyler out of there. \n116.  E X T .

He's not some dweeb flunkie, he runs the whole show. \nEND SERIES OF SHOTS, DISSOLVE TO: \n128. SCHUYLER'S FACE... LIGHTS through the FRAGMENTED WINDSHIELD cast weird PATTERNS on it.  He's pumping sweat now, reaches for his cell phone, dials, hand shaking.  Christine flicks her cig out the window; she sounds regretful. \nCHRISTINE I'm sorry.  They already did your brother, I guess they figured you for a family of suckers... \nSCHUYLER (on phone) Overseas operator?  Please dial the number for Allgemeine Bank in Zurich... \nCHRISTINE Bet you haven't really been taking care of business the past few days, huh?  This \"game,\" the psych shit about your dad going sui... \nSCHUYLER (on phone) Guten tag-- Vilen dank, Englisch... \nCHRISTINE All of it was just to buy time, keep you from paying attention... \nSCHUYLER (on phone) Blue Two-Five... 6-9-0-D... Yes, I consent to voice-print... My name is Schuyler Van Orton.  I'd like to know my balance, please... that account is closed?! \nCHRISTINE (nervously) I think maybe you should pull over... \nSchuyler sets his jaw, drops the phone-- and turns the wheel hard. \n129.

Christine stands out of earshot, arms folded, staring at the dark horizon. \nSCHUYLER (on phone) Bob, listen carefully, this is an emergency.  Feingold and his people, I've called all my banks, they've drained the accounts, personal and corporate, everything-- tell the cops I've got one of them with me, we'll make her testify.  They're trying to kill us, I'm heading for the island in Oregon, if I can still find it. Bob-- call when you get this message and-- be extremely careful... \n131.  I N T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T \nSTART ON-- a thermos full of coffee, foodstuffs, miscellaneous camping supplies as a CLERK holds a credit card, hangs up a phone. He looks up at SCHUYLER and CHRISTINE. \nCLERK They say I gotta confiscate your card... \nSchuyler sighs, \"of course,\" Christine fishes in her pocket. \nCHRISTINE I think I have some cash. \n132.  E X T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T \nThey emerge from the store with a couple of grocery bags, Christine sucks an ice cream pop.  They toss the bags in the trunk. \nCHRISTINE Money isn't everything, right? \nSchuyler is seething, clutching the trunk lid for a beat, then SLAMS it hard when she steps back, making her jump. \nSCHUYLER It might be best if you didn't speak.  I very nearly crushed your skull just now. \nCHRISTINE C'mon chill, what'd they take you for, a couple hundred G's?  Chump change for a guy like you, chalk it up to experience. \nSCHUYLER (quietly, restraining himself) Just under a billion dollars. \nCHRISTINE A bil--? (nervous laugh) You're kidding, right? \nSCHUYLER Do I look like I'm kidding? This is about more than my personal lifestyle-- your pals raided pension plans, charitable foundations, company payrolls... \nCHRISTINE Oh my God-- \nSCHUYLER I don't know what kind of jerk-off con games you've played in the past, but now you're in the big leagues, hon.  You just helped sabotage a small portion of the national economy-- and destroy a whole lotta lives. \nHe stares at her, she looks sick and truly scared.  He climbs in the car.  For once without a comeback, she gets in the car quietly. \nCUT TO: \n133.  E X T .   D I R T   R O A D  -  D A W N \nThe Benz ZIPS AROUND a logging truck on a DIRT ROAD. \n134.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   C A R  -  D A W N \nSchuyler, bleary-eyed, drains coffee from the thermos and tosses it aside.

O R E G O N   L A K E  -  D A Y \nA beautiful Northern lake-- dense forests on the mainland, pines and fall foliage.  A STORM coming in, ominous CLOUDS.  The Benz is parked at the shoreline.  MOVE TO FIND Schuyler and Christine, as they paddle a rowboat toward a small island with a surprisingly humble, somewhat decrepit cabin on it.  A FLASH OF LIGHTNING. \nCUT TO: \n136.  I N T .   O R E G O N   C A B I N  -  D A Y \nCHRISTINE pours a cup of coffee from a metal pot on a wood-burning stove in which a FIRE CRACKLES.  This cabin is genuinely rustic and run-down-- hewn wood, fishing rods, cobwebs, rain damage, dust. WATER DRIPS from the ceiling in a few places.  LIGHTNING FLASHES in BG through the scene, the STORM has gotten pretty bad. \nSCHUYLER finishes taking out his contacts, DROPPING them in cups full of water. He slips on his glasses, then looks at a few framed family photos on the coffee table in front of him.  Christine, barefoot, brings him a cup of coffee, which he sips gratefully. \nSCHUYLER You're not having any? \nCHRISTINE Never drink it.  Makes my tits hurt. \nSchuyler gives her a sidelong glance, looks back at a photo. \nCHRISTINE We needed you to call your banks. Cellular calls can be intercepted, rerouted, y'know. \nShe crouches by him, flicking ashes a few inches from his nose. \nCHRISTINE All those calls to Switzerland and Chase Manhattan-- you were talking to our people.  See, we were still missing a lotta pieces-- access codes, passwords, stuff even Plyrnpton didn't have-- but now we have I everything.  I guess you are pretty fucking stupid-- but thanks. \nHe CLAWS at her helplessly with a GROAN, but misses.  His glasses fall off, he collapses again. \nSCHUYLER'S POV-- everything a BLUR NOW, except in EXTREME FG-- the photo of himself and his father, which now lies on the floor. \n137. FLASH-CUT TO:  FLASHBACK POV-- THE MOMENT OF IMPACT, as MR. VAN ORTON'S FACE SMASHES into the ground, his GLASSES SHATTERING, BLOOD SPRAYING from his head. \n138.

SCHUYLER'S POV-- FROM FLOOR-- Christine moves INTO FOCUS, crouches near him, studying her victim almost clinically. \nCHRISTINE It's over.  Just let go... \nThe SFX POUNDING STOPS, and-- \nCUT TO BLACK \nBREATHING... THEN SCREAMING, POUNDING and KICKING... \n141.  I N T .   C R Y P T  -  D A Y \nA WOODEN LID SPLINTERS as SCHUYLER pounds his way out of a COFFIN. DIM LIGHT through CRACKS in the walls, this is an old and moldering MAUSOLEUM, other COFFINS nearby.  FRESH FLOWERS surround his resting place, otherwise everything is completely DECAYED. \nBy the time SCHUYLER gets out of the coffin, his arms are BLOODIED. He's been dressed in an ALL-WHITE BURIAL SUIT.  A RED ROSE is TAPED to his chest.  He blinks and stares about wildly-- \nHIS POV-- BLURRY, can't make out much. \nSCHUYLER blinks, breathing hard, utterly freaked.  He notices the ROSE on his chest, tears it off, SNIFFS it, then THROWS IT aside with a frustrated CRY.  He stumbles to the heavy door of the crypt, tugs, then realizes it opens the other way-- he gives it a PUSH-- \n142.  E X T .   C E M E T E R Y  -  D A Y \nIT COLLAPSES immediately.  SCHUYLER tumbles out of the crypt into the HOT SUNLIGHT.  He's in a ramshackle city of the dead, a SPANISH GRAVEYARD.  There are endless rows of TOMBS, rioting tropical VEGETATION, many FLOWERS, impossibly bright COLORS.  It should be quite beautiful and peaceful... \nSCHUYLER What? \nHe walks around tentatively, SQUINTING.  AN OLD WOMAN in black sits contemplating a grave, fingering her rosary.  SCHUYLER slips a hand absently into his pocket, and finds something there, pulls it out-- \nSCHUYLER'S POV-- BLURRY shot of a NOTE in SPANISH, with a KEY on the stationery... \nSCHUYLER blinks, slips the note in his pocket. \nCUT TO: \n143.

The world's a BLUR, FACES move in and out of FOCUS.  They're dark, foreign, many POOR PEOPLE, poverty-scarred features.  Scraps of SPANISH.  He grabs a DARK MAN. \nSCHUYLER Where am I?! \nThe man replies with an EXCLAMATION in SPANISH, pushes Schuyler away, CAMERA TUMBLES-- \nOBJECTIVE SHOT-- Schuyler's on his knees in the middle of this third-world thoroughfare, utterly disoriented.  STREET VENDORS sell weird-looking foods, squads of SQLDIERS march with rifles, MUSICIANS PLAY odd instruments... Schuyler clutches his head, as if trying to wish it all away. \nA COP IN BEIGE UNIFORM suddenly prods at him with a nightstick, YELLING AT HIM in SPANISH to move on. \nSCHUYLER'S POV-- the COP looming over him, a BLURRY menace, the end of the nightstick SHARP in FG as it POKES at him. \nANOTHER ANGLE-- Schuyler pleads with the man: \nSCHUYLER Please, help me, I'm an American! I'm lost!  Please!! \nThis doesn't seem to help.  He tries to get away from the stick, but the cop pursues.  He bangs into people as he tries to move quickly, the stick right behind him. \nSchuyler FALLS over a BEGGAR on the ground, in far worse shape than he is.  The cop YELLS at him.  Schuyler covers his head, holding out the NOTE WITH THE KEY, which the cop finally snatches away.  He studies it for a moment, then BARKS with LAUGHTER. \nSCHUYLER'S POV-- the cop reaches down to him-- \nOBJECTIVE ANGLE-- Schuyler cringes, expecting a blow, but the cop just pulls him to his feet.  He drags him away with him, speaking more gently IN SPANISH, amused.  Schuyler nods thankfully. \nHIGH ANGLE-- the THRONGS on this crowded street. \nCUT TO: \n144.  I N T .

Tegucigalpa? \nSCHUYLER That's gibberish! \nDESK SERGEANT (annoyed) It is the capital of Honduras. \nSCHUYLER buries his face in his hands, nods.  He's relieved to have found an English speaker at least. \n152A(NEW). IN THE KITCHEN, SCHUYLER gobbles handfuls of dry cereal, grabs for anything he can find in the refrigerator. \n153. IN THE SHOWER, Schuyler scrubs away the grime. \n154. IN THE BATHROOM, he inserts a CONTACT LENS. \n154A. IN A DESK DRAWER he finds a few $20.00 bills. \n154B. IN THE BEDROOM-- Schuyler changes into jeans and a sport jacket, tucking the MONEY and the POSTCARD into the pockets.  As he turns to leave, he spots something on his dresser-- \nA WHITE ENVELOPE, with a handwritten \"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN...\" \nSCHUYLER frowns at this. tears it open. reacts with fear... \n155. IN THE KITCHEN, SCHUYLER holds the handwritten note to the BLUE FLAME.  He tosses the BURNING PAGE into the sink. \nCLOSE SHOTS on the curling, burning note, we make out KEY WORDS: \n\"MY FATHER WAS RIGHT,\" \"NO REASON TO CONTINUE,\" \"TAKE MY OWN LIFE,\" \"I WANT ONLY DEATH...\" and finally the signature, \"SCHUYLER VAN ORTON...\"  This suicide note is no joke. \nSCHUYLER backs away from the sink.  Quiet, determined: \nSCHUYLER No.  Fuck you... I'm going to live... \n156.  I N T .   S T U D Y  -  N I G H T \nSchuyler moves to a bookshelf, looking for a volume, finds-- \nCLOSE-- a large, leather-bound BLACK BOOK with no title. \nSCHUYLER clutches the volume.  HEADLIGHTS shine in the window, a VEHICLE in the drive.  Schuyler moves for a back door. \n157.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T \nA CAR DOOR CLOSES, we see a UNIFORMED FIGURE MOVE O. S., revealing A POLICE STYLE CREST, the words \"CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL SECURITY,\" the initials \"CRS\" in the center. \nSCHUYLER, sneaking around the side of the house, takes this in, waiting for the RENT-A-COPS with FLASHLIGHTS and WEAPONS to enter his house.  Then he hurries away, book under his arm. \n157A(NEW).  E X T .   P A C I F I C   H E I G H T S   S T R E E T  -  D A W N \nUNDER A STREET LAMP on a hilly street, SCHUYLER reaches into his pocket and squints at THE POSTCARD-- \nINSERT POSTCARD, the message side:  \"S - IT'S SAFE HERE - D.\"  An ARROW points to a printed ADDRESS.  Schuyler FLIPS the card over-- a PAINTING of a COLONIAL MANSION down a tree-lined DRIVE... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n158.  E X T .   M A N S I O N   G A T E S  -  D A Y \nTHE SAME VIEW of the same mansion, a very beautiful, peaceful spot. SCHUYLER moves down the drive toward the entrance.  He carries the thick book, as he will through following scenes. \n159.  I N T .   S A N I T A R I U M   C O R R I D O R  -  D A Y \nA NURSE leads Schuyler down a door-lined corridor, no one in sight. This place turns out to be an incredibly ritzy SANITARIUM. \nNURSE The medication seems to be helping. Unfortunately we're going to have to transfer your brother to a public institution in a few days, his funds are entirely exhausted-- unless you're prepared to take responsibility... \nShe KNOCKS at a door, OPENS IT a crack and lets Schuyler in. \n160.  I N T .   S A N I T A R I U M   R O O M  -  D A Y \nA pleasant bedroom, and safe-- no sharp objects or primary colors in sight, discreet decorative BARS on the window. \nDAVID, in pajamas, sits in a chair, eating bland food from a plastic lunch tray.  He watches a GOLF MATCH on a tiny WATCHMAN TV, we'll hear it IN BG-- CLAPPING, etc.  He doesn't react as Schuyler enters, moves to his side. \nSCHUYLER David... \nDavid turns to him, half-smiles; food particles on his lips. \nDAVID Hello Sky... \nSchuyler sits close to David, upset. \nSCHUYLER What are you doing here? \nDAVID Sorry, I was just eating...  I'm much better.  Really. \nDavid does seem in control now, if a little hazy. \nSCHUYLER Thank God... Listen, I know you put them onto me-- but I understand, we're both victims of this thing... They've stolen everything we ever had, they're trying to drive us both crazy-- but we won't let them. We'll find a way.  There's gotta be a way to beat these bastards!  We're in it together... \nHe clutches his brother's hand.  David narrows his eyes, confused. \nDAVID In what together? \nSCHUYLER The game. \nDAVID Oh, Schuyler, there is no game.  It was just a fantasy of mine, a self- aggrandizing delusion... I can't believe you took that shit seriously. \nSCHUYLER (clutching his hand) No, David-- please... \nDAVID (pulling away) Oh, man, stop fucking with me! You know the game doesn't exist... it never did!  It never did... \nSchuyler stares at him for a beat-- no getting through.  David leans forward, turns UP THE TV VOLUME, aiming the set at Schuyler. \nDAVID Can you see? \nSCHUYLER (cold, deadly) Come on, you're not going to put me through all this shit and then kill me on a fucking train, it won't look like a suicide... \nAs Schuyler speaks he sits up, the PUNK grabs the bag-- Schuyler grabs the guy's knife hand, they wrestle on the floor of the car, clawing at each other.  The punk drops the knife, it gets knocked beneath the seat, both men reach for it... \nTRANSIT COP Freeze assholes! \nSchuyler and the punk look up to see a TRANSIT COP pointing his WEAPON.  The punk throws his hands up, scrambles to his feet-- \nPUNK Psycho pulled a knife on me! \nThe cop has grabbed the still prone Schuyler, flipping him over and slapping a handcuff on him-- \nSCHUYLER What do you think you're doing, this guy attacked me! \nThe cop has dropped his guard; the punk spins and bolts into the next car, squeezing through the door.  The TRANSIT COP hastily cuffs Schuyler to an armrest-- \nTRANSIT COP Wait here-- \nHe dashes into the next car after the punk.  Schuyler looks at the floor of the car, sees-- \nTHE SMALL RADIO and its EARPLUG attached by a WIRE.  The radio has a tiny LOOP/RABBIT EAR antenna on it.  He snatches it up, then YANKS at the cuff.  He spots the knife under the seat, grabs it, starts using the blade to unscrew the armrest from its post. \nFROM THE NEXT CAR he hears SHOUTS, SCREAMS, a serious commotion going on, he doesn't know who's winning.  Schuyler's almost gotten free as the TRAIN SLOWS, when-- \n--the DOOR at the far end of the car opens, it's the PUNK, bruised and bloody, ready to kill. \nHe lunges at Schuyler just as he PRIES THE ARMREST off the seat and CLOBBERS him with it.  The punk reels back.  The train has stopped, the doors have opened-- Schuyler grabs his bag and squeezes out onto the platform just before they shut again. \n166.  I N T .   B A R T   S T A T I O N  -  D A Y \nSCHUYLER locks the free cuff on to the same wrist as the other, sliding his jacket over them, moving briskly up the stairs. \n167.  E X T .   B E R K E L E Y   S T R E E T  -  D A Y \nSCHUYLER emerges and walks quickly, checking over his shoulder, BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT MORNING SUN.  He fiddles with the RADIO, the PLUG to his ear.  We hear STATIC, BLEEPING NOISES, FILTERED VOICES. For a few moments the VOICES ON THE RADIO become CLEARER. \nRADIO VOICE #1 --can't let him get away with this, he's outta control!  The next thing you know, he'll push the wrong button and we'll all be dead-- \nSCHUYLER listens intently, leaning against a wall in the shadows, breathing hard.  He stares nervously at a couple of nearby STREET PEOPLE huddled by a shopping cart, they stare back.  Another VOICE on the radio talks OVER the first: \nRADIO VOICE #2 --Whoah whoah whoah-- OK the guy's a moron, sure, but he doesn't have the balls to end the world!  Anyway I'm sicka talking politics, let's get back to the business of nipple piercing-- you got a ring, don't ya Robin? \nWe hear the HYSTERICAL GIGGLING of ROBIN QUIVERS.  SCHUYLER blinks, recognizing the voice of RADIO DJ HOWARD STERN. \nRADIO VOICE #2 (HOWARD STERN) Ugh, we gotta do commercials, this is the Howard Stern show... \nSCHUYLER fiddles frantically with the dial and antennas, calling up RANDOM RADIO MUSIC, COMMERCIALS, etc. \nCLOSE ON A TRASH CAN-- Schuyler tosses his hollowed leather book into it.  It falls open, we see the gun is gone. \nCUT TO: \n168(NEW).  I N T .   H O S P I C E  -  D A Y \nTRACK DOWN an institutional corridor, a few EMACIATED PATIENTS in wheelchairs... they only come here to die.  ELIZABETH, Schuyler's ex, 4Oish, fit and attractive, a few months pregnant, READS to a couple of sad PATIENTS in a lounge area.  She trails off as she looks up, astonished to see-- \nSCHUYLER, bruised, frightened, almost looking like he belongs here. \nSCHUYLER Hello Elizabeth... \n168A(NEW).  I N T .   S P O R T S   C A R  -  D A Y \nElizabeth backs out of a parking lot in a 3OO-ZX CONVERTIBLE and pulls into traffic, Schuyler beside her, babbling emotionally. \nSCHUYLER I'm sorry, I shouldn't be bothering you-- you're a genuinely good person, your work is important, it's real, nothing that happens to me is real anymore-- \nELIZABETH What has happened to you, Sky? \nSCHUYLER I need your help, you're the only one left, the only one I can trust-- not that I deserve your help, God how could you have even married me, I was a shit to you-- \nELIZABETH No you weren't-- \nSCHUYLER Yes I was.  Sometimes I think I'm being punished for my sins, I mean, there has to be a reason... \nCUT TO: \n169.  I N T .   B R E A K F A S T   P L A C E  -  D A Y \nELIZABETH FLIPS THE PAGES of Schuyler's notebook-- page after page of psychotic-looking scribbling, dense UNDERLINES, many EXCLAMATION POINTS.  ON ONE PAGE-- \"CRUEL RANDOM SHIT.\" \nWIDER-- a few BUSINESS PEOPLE read papers, pick at eggs; A LARGE- SCREEN TV plays MORNING PROGRAMS.  Schuyler stares at Elizabeth, awaiting reaction... she seems incapable of speech.  He puts the tiny radio and earplug on the table between them. \nSCHUYLER This is one of their devices, I pulled it off their assassin in the subway.  It's how they communicate with each other. \nElizabeth picks the thing up, studies it, puts the plug to her ear. \nELIZABETH It's... a radio... \nSchuyler waves dismissively, \"you don't understand,\" takes the radio back from her and pockets it. \nSCHUYLER I can't find the right channel... Listen, I may not make it through this-- if anything happens, get that notebook to, to, the press, or the FBI or something.  Someone you can trust, I don't know, assuming you can trust anyone.  I just want you to know I'm not crazy, and I didn't kill myself, no matter what they say-- \nShe stares at him, trying to be strong, but she's very freaked out. A BARMAID brings their order.  Schuyler stares at the barmaid suspiciously as she puts a cup of coffee before Elizabeth, and gives him a bottle of water and a glass.  He tests the seal. \nSCHUYLER Has this been opened? \nSCHUYLER He's an actor, does TV commercials, I know he's ordered from you, he had food delivered to an office building on Mission-- \nCHINESE WOMAN Many customers, very busy, I don't know, I don't know-- \nSCHUYLER Damn it! \nSchuyler stalks away from her, finds himself facing the wall of signed photographs-- \nON WALL, old and stained pictures, the most famous being the likes of ED McMAHON and CHARO.  Among them is a newer HEAD SHOT of FEINGOLD with a shit-eating grin... below, the name WILLIAM FISHER. \nSCHUYLER leaps on the counter and tears the photo off the wall-- \nCHINESE WOMAN Stop that, what you doing?! \nSchuyler's already leapt off the counter, bolts out the door. \n175B(NEW).  I N T .   E L I Z A B E T H ' S   C A R  -  D A Y \nSCHUYLER is on the CARPHONE, glances from the road to-- \nTHE OBVERSE OF THE HEAD SHOT in his hand, a PHONE NUMBER before the (short) list of credits, he flips it to show Feingold/Fisher. \nSCHUYLER (on phone) Yes, Mrs. Fisher, I know it's short notice but we were hoping your husband could come in for an audition today, he's perfect... \nSCHUYLER looks annoyed at what he's hearing. \nSCHUYLER Isn't there any way we can get in touch with him now...?  I see... \nHe makes a quick U-TURN, the tires SCREECHING. \nSCENES 176-179 DELETED \n180.  E X T .   Z O O  -  D A Y \nLate afternoon.  PAN FROM THE ENTRANCE to find SCHUYLER buying a ticket and hurrying in. \n181. IN THE ZOO, Schuyler prowls the crowd with manic energy. \nSCHUYLER'S POV-- ZOO-GOERS gazing at the ANIMALS... CAMERA FINDS Feingold/Fisher, wearing casual clothes, eating a popsicle.  He's doing his best to supervise THREE OBNOXIOUS CHILDREN, two boys and an older girl.  He's just another dad at the zoo, far from impressive-- the Wizard of Oz after the curtain's been pulled. \nWhen he makes eye contact with Schuyler, he pales, trying to herd the children together as Schuyler moves in on him... he can't get away.  Schuyler grabs the man's shirt. \nSCHUYLER Bill Fisher, hi!  I really admire your work... \nFEINGOLD Oh please... I got my kids here... \nSchuyler releases him, Feingold sheepishly avoids his eyes. Schuyler casually shows him the gun, the man's eyes widen. \nSCHUYLER Get rid of them. \nFEINGOLD (to the kids) Hey, everyone-- here's a twenty! Snack time! \nHe dangles the bill over their heads, the KIDS CHEER, leap like dolphins after fish.  The girl's tallest, grabs the cash, they run for a nearby concession.  Schuyler and Feingold stroll together. \nFEINGOLD Look, buddy, it was just a job-- nothing personal, y'know?  I play my part, improvise a little, that's what I'm good at, I still do a little stand-up-- \nSCHUYLER I've seen your resume.  I'm sick of foot soldiers, I've gotta get to whoever's in charge. \nFEINGOLD Of CRS?  Christ, nobody knows, nobody gets the big picture-- (looking away) Jason, Tommy, cut it out! \nFEINGOLD'S BOYS ARE THROWING ROCKS at the monkeys.  They give their father a look and saunter along. \nSCHUYLER's not interested in the zoo drama. \nFEINGOLD Goddammit, why do they do that. \nSCHUYLER How do I find them!?  Their offices were abandoned-- \nFEINGOLD They own the whole building, they just move from floor to floor. \nSchuyler takes this in for a moment, thinking. \nSCHUYLER OK... They know you, you've worked for them.  You're going to get me inside. \nFEINGOLD (shaking his head) Uh-uh, I'm sorry and all, but-- \nSCHUYLER Tell them anything, tell them the cops are after you, you've gotta talk to someone or you'll blow the whistle. \nFEINGOLD No way, it's too dangerous. \nSchuyler cocks his head, steps in front of him.  Right in his face: \nSCHUYLER You don't seem to understand.  Right here, right now-- I'm the danger. \nFeingold gets the message. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n182.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  N I G H T \nLIGHTS OFF in the building.  A battered STATION WAGON rounds a corner, PAUSES before the ramp to the garage entrance-- the same garage he and Christine were once tormented in. \n183.  I N T .   S T A T I O N   W A G O N  -  N I G H T \nFEINGOLD drives, looking very tense; a kiddie seat strapped next to him, junk galore; he's apparently alone. \nEven though she's keeping a surface cool, he notices the GLASS and SILVERWARE on her tray RATTLING.  She starts to move toward a table, he blocks her path. \nSCHUYLER You're not going anywhere. Feingold, or or Fisher, was that just a game too? \nCHRISTINE What are you talking about? \nSCHUYLER I watched him die... \nSchuyler shows her his BLOOD-STAINED HAND.  Christine looks utterly perplexed, then shrugs, finding a place to put down her tray. \nSCHUYLER Seemed like a nice guy, actually, father of three-- \nCHRISTINE Well, look, I'm sure it's just another stunt-- that can't be real, taste it. \nSCHUYLER You taste it, you fucking vampire. \nHe pushes his palm in her face, she flinches, swipes him away, then puts a finger to her ear as-- \nTHE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and the guard and security man from downstairs burst into the commissary. \nSuddenly the ROOM QUIETS, many others are touching their ears. \nThey all TURN in the direction of Schuyler and Christine.  The gate guard gestures at Schuyler, attempting a smile. \nGATE GUARD Could you come with us, please? You're not authorized to be here. \nSchuyler grabs Christine, wraps an arm around her throat, puts his GUN to her neck. \nSCHUYLER Back off.  Everybody back off. \nHe uses his knee in the small of her back to push her brutally toward the nearest door, she CHOKES and GASPS. \n188.  I N T .   S T A I R W E L L  -  N I G H T \nThe door shuts behind them, the stairs only lead UP. \nSCHUYLER Shit, how do we get out-- \nChristine STOMPS his foot and ELBOWS his gut, breaks free and bolts up the stairs.  Schuyler catches his breath and pursues.  Beneath him, the stairwell door opens, GUARDS PURSUE. \n189.  E X T .   C R S   R O O F  -  N I G H T \nA HIGH LEDGE surrounds the roof on all four sides, a ROOF ENTRANCE at each side as well.  The NUMBER \"636\" is painted large for helicopters; there are air conditioning vents, ducts, etc.  A MUFFLED ALARM sounds as Christine bursts through the door, followed by Schuyler.  She spins, her back to the EDGE of the atrium, a black pit in the center of the roof with a sunken GLASS SKYLIGHT, a white RAILING around it. \nSchuyler SLAMS the door, a large number 1 painted on it in BLUE. He throws the HEAVY BOLT.  He and Christine circle each other warily, his gun trained on her.  POUNDING from the other side, MUFFLED VOICES that can't be heard. \nFor the first time, Christine focuses on the gun in his hand, then clutches the railing. \nCHRISTINE Wait a minute.  What's that? \nSchuyler addresses her as if speaking to a child: \nSCHUYLER It's my gun... \nCHRISTINE We didn't give it to you?  Where did it come from? \nSCHUYLER A gun store. \nCHRISTINE We searched your house! \nSCHUYLER Guess you fucked up again. \nChristine touches her ear, listening to something, then puts her hand to her mouth, speaks urgently. \nCHRISTINE He's armed, he's got a real gun. Real Situation, real-- \nSchuyler steps forward and violently wrenches the EAR PIECE and HAND MIKE away from Christine, the wire tears her blouse open. \nSCHUYLER Yeah, it's real all right. \nCHRISTINE Schuyler this is all fake, tricks, it's all part of the game-- \nSCHUYLER Stop it.  Every word out of your mouth is a lie-- \nChristine's desperately panicked, fumbling for words. \nCHRISTINE The key!!  They, we gave you a key to the elevator!  Why would we do that?!  We wanted you to come up-- \nSCHUYLER Of course you did.  So you could kill me or, or frame me for murder-- \nCHRISTINE No, no, it's THE GAME!!  Blanks, squibs, high-tech special effects, none of it's real!  Just open that door and I'll show you! \nSchuyler hesitates a moment, looking in the direction of the door. \nSCHUYLER I open the door and I die. \nON THE DOOR-- POUNDING DESPERATE, but the ALARM DROWNS out the sounds of VOICES on the other side. \nSCHUYLER turns quickly as she takes a step towards him.  He points the gun at her again.  He looks ready to use it.  The following DIALOG overlaps and collides, growing AURAL CHAOS-- \nSCHUYLER You move again I swear I'll kill you, you bitch. \nCHRISTINE THINK ABOUT IT!!  They followed you every step of the way, the cab, in the trunk, we had a diver-- \nSCHUYLER They?  We? \nSHIFT TO SLOW MOTION: \nSCHUYLER moves for the edge of the atrium pit... \nTHE OTHERS react in HORROR, SHOUT \"NO!!\", lunging TOWARD HIM... \nDAVID'S HEAD suddenly MOVES, he BLINKS... \nSCHUYLER leaps onto the safety barrier around the atrium pit. \nCHRISTINE jumps to her feet, perfectly alert, a hand extended, SCREAMING, just as-- \nSCHUYLER CATAPULTS HIMSELF INTO SPACE, and-- \nDAVID SITS BOLT UPRIGHT. \nDAVID SKY, NOOOO!! \nSCHUYLER sees this, too late-- \nHE AND DAVID make terrified, helpless eye contact across the void, arms outstretched.  Schuyler has time to register his irrevocable error as he seems to hang suspended above the glass skylight for an agonizing MOMENT. \nTHEN HE FALLS...  LEAVE SLOW MOTION. \n190.  I N T .   A T R I U M  -  N I G H T \nSCHUYLER CRASHES through the skylight, TUMBLING-- SPARKLING SHARDS surround him like stars as he PLUNGES, SPINS, SCREAMING. \n191. RAPID CUTS-- the CLOWN, CHRISTINE's face, SCHUYLER and DAVID as CHILDREN, HIS FATHER's head striking the landing.  These FLASH PAST so rapidly we can't quite process them. \n192. INTERCUT WITH:  INCREASING DARKNESS, GROUND RUSHING CLOSER... \nON SCHUYLER'S FACE as he experiences the epiphany that comes before the end.  BRILLIANT ANGELIC LIGHT suddenly illuminates him, his eyes roll into his head, closing-- \nANGLE FROM ABOVE-- the LIGHTS are real, they've COME ON to show-- \nSCHUYLER'S IMPACT-- he LANDS on his back, arms outstretched, eyes squeezed shut-- \n--and is swallowed by an ENORMOUS INFLATED LIFESAVING CUSHION that covers the floor of the atrium. \nSCHUYLER BOUNCES in the cushion a few times, gradually coming to a rest, harmless bits of BREAKAWAY GLASS showering down around him. \nHe doesn't move a muscle, his eyes still closed. \nCLOSER ON HIS FACE... muscles twitch.  His eyes open. \nHIS POV-- UP the now illuminated tunnel formed by the walls of the building around the atrium.  THE FULL MOON in the very center through the hole in the glass. \nAll the lighted GLASS ELEVATORS COME TO EARTH, packed with people. \nSCHUYLER stares upward, mouth open, motionless. \nDAVID comes running from an elevator, leaps up onto the cushion and bounces over to Schuyler, a huge smile on his face. \nDAVID Hey, bro, how you doin'? \nGetting no response, David hops closer, squats by Schuyler's side. \nDAVID Admit it, you weren't bored... \nSCHUYLER remains motionless, David's worried now, grabs his arm and starts shaking him. \nDAVID Jesus.  Sky, c'mon Sky-- \nSCHUYLER begins to LAUGH, a tremendous catharsis.  DAVID laughs too, greatly relieved as he helps Schuyler to his feet. \nTHE TWO BROTHERS clutch each other for support on the BOUNCING surface, LAUGHING.  CRS EMPLOYEES have gathered around the cushion, CHEERING and APPLAUDING. \nSCHUYLER wipes his eyes, shaking his head with amazement.  Then he hauls back and SLUGS DAVID in the jaw, sending him flying onto his back on the cushion.  MORE CHEERS from the crowd, as if they were watching a boxing match. \nCUT TO: \n193.  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y  -  N I G H T \nTHE HALLELUJAH CHORUS from Handel's \"Messiah\" plays.  SCHUYLER and DAVID enter together from the atrium, the CUSHION deflates behind them.  David licks blood from his lips, rubs his jaw. \nDAVID You've been wanting to do that for a long, long time, haven't you? \nSchuyler half-smiles.  The SECURITY MAN unlocks Schuyler's handcuffs, giving him back his gun, which Schuyler stares at. \nDAVID Like they'd really leave a loaded gun lying around.  They went over the whole place with a metal detector, then packed that thing with blanks. \nThey turn a corner into the main lobby, Schuyler absently pockets the gun, looks up in wonder... \nSCHUYLER'S POV-- a SURPRISE PARTY:  A STEREO, STREAMERS and BALLOONS, a CHAMPAGNE FOUNTAIN, CAKE and FOOD.  CRS EMPLOYEES (mostly ordinary-looking office workers) CLAP and CHEER for Schuyler.  They wear PARTY HATS, blow PLASTIC HORNS. \nSMILING PEOPLE eager to offer CONGRATULATIONS surround him.  He's pretty shaky, like a newborn calf.  JOHN and PETE shake his hand. \nJOHN Good one, buddy, really had you going, didn't we? \nPETE Wait'll you try level two... (a wink) Joke. \nThe RASTA SLAPS his back, Schuyler instinctively looks over his shoulder for a gag message. \nRASTA That look on your face up there? Shit, man, I almost lost it. \n", "test1_input": "Partitioned work areas, terminals, clutter and disarray.  Office doors open off a reception area.  CRS EMPLOYEES move about hectically.  Schuyler enters, wanders about for a moment, confused. A friendly female RECEPTIONIST glances up from her desk. \nRECEPTIONIST Can I help you? \nSCHUYLER Is this Consumer Recreation Services?  I have an appointment, the name's Van Orton. \nThe woman flips through an appointment book with a logo, CRS.  IN BG, JIM FEINGOLD pays a CHINESE DELIVERY GUY for a BAG OF FOOD. \nRECEPTIONIST Hm... I don't seem to-- \nSCHUYLER Schuyler Van Orton, I called last week. \nThe woman shakes her head.  FEINGOLD slows as he crosses past Schuyler, carrying the bag.  He's 30-40, a no-nonsense engineer, looks a bit dull, but he exudes competence and trustworthiness. \nFEINGOLD Problem? \nRECEPTIONIST This gentlemen says he has an appointment, but... \nFeingold glances at Schuyler, shrugs. \nFEINGOLD Van Orton, huh?  I'll take him. (shakes his hand) Jim Feingold, v. p. in charge of engineering and data analysis. \nThe man leads Schuyler to a row of open boxes on the floor, looks in a couple, then finds what he's after.  He snatches up a couple of pages, hands them to Schuyler.  Then he finds a clipboard on the floor, tosses it to him like a frisbee. \nFEINGOLD Sorry about the chaos, we're still in the process of moving... follow me, I've got an office around here someplace. \nHe reaches into a box of PENS, passes one to Schuyler. \nCLOSE ON PEN-- the CRS LOGO. \nCUT TO: \n29.  I N T .   F E I N G O L D ' S   O F F I C E / H A L L W A Y  -  D A Y \nA modern, dramatic office.  Swoopy furniture, imposing ART, all very cool-looking.  Feingold moves behind the desk, unpacks a couple of white cartons. \nFEINGOLD I can't remember the last time I ate in a restaurant, all I do is work... \nSCHUYLER sits on a couch, looking at the forms. \nSCHUYLER I know what you mean.  Look-- what is all this? \nThe fast-talking Feingold moves energetically through the office, occasionally picking at his food or poking at the air with chopsticks-- he's a bit hyper and fidgety in general. \nFEINGOLD Application, MMPI and TAT tests, financial statement... (indicating food) Want some?  Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown... (as Schuyler shakes his head) The tests serve a threefold purpose. First off, are you right for us? Are we right for you?  Unfortunately, there's a limited number of slots-- \nSCHUYLER Let's back up here-- \nFEINGOLD (over him) B, we need an idea of your abilities and limitations, what turns you on, and off.  Numero tres, our insurance company requires it. (a beat, studying Schuyler) You're familiar with our service, aren't you? \nSCHUYLER Not at all.  What are you selling? \nFEINGOLD Well... it's a game. \nSCHUYLER A game. \nFEINGOLD Recharges the batteries, gets you off the treadmill, it's an experience.  Sort of a-- vacation for the guy who's been everywhere. \nSCHUYLER This really doesn't sound like my sort of-- \nFeingold sits on the edge of his desk, arms crossed, nodding and smiling condescendingly-- he raises a hand to stop Schuyler. \nSCHUYLER What's so amusing? \nFEINGOLD Nothing.  I know who you are. You're David Van Orton's brother, he got you in here. \nSCHUYLER So. \nFEINGOLD (remembering fondly) David was-- impressive, one of the better I've seen.  But frankly, I can see you're not the type. \nSCHUYLER The type. \nFEINGOLD You know, a player. \nSCHUYLER I'm not a player. \nFEINGOLD I don't mean anything personal by it-- I know you're an important guy, powerful guy, you're used to being on top.  It's just, this isn't for everyone.  Not everyone can handle it. \nSCHUYLER (nearly losing it) What kind of fu-- game is this? \nFEINGOLD The ultimate fucking game.  I wish I could tell you more, but it's different every time. (rising) Thanks for coming in-- \nSCHUYLER (doesn't move) I'm not an idiot.  I see what you're doing.  First the vague yet intriguing pitch, then I'm supposed to feel like my manhood's in question because I'm not up for, what, some motivational role-playing fantasy nonsense-- \nFEINGOLD Interesting, you don't know the first thing about it but you've already decided what it is... Listen, I don't wanna waste any more-- \nSCHUYLER Please, Jim, cut the hard-to-get shit.  I've got the afternoon free, I'll take your silly tests. \nFeingold cocks his head, reappraising him.  Then, with a smile, he calls to an attractive young WOMAN passing in the hall; Schuyler, meanwhile, flips through the pages of the tests. \nFEINGOLD Ms. Nelson, are you busy?  We need someone to run Mr. Van Orton. \nMS. NELSON This way, sir... \nAs she leads Schuyler out the door, Feingold WINKS at him. \n", "test1_true": "Schuyler reacts-- a physical?  He throws up a hand and follows the woman into the hall.  Alone now, Feingold cracks a fortune cookie and glances at the slip of paper inside.  He furrows his brow with concern at the fortune-- then tosses it aside. \nCUT TO: \n30. CRS OFFICES - SERIES OF SHOTS \nDuring the following QUICK CUTS, SOUNDS will be layered in and CONTINUE over one another, e. g. the SOUND of a scraping pencil, the BLIPS of machinery, HEAVY BREATHING, MURMURING VOICES of TECHNICIANS giving instructions... \nA. X-CLOSE:  A #2 pencil FILLS IN box after box on a long MMPI form.  CLOSE on a couple of these:  \"I sometimes hurt animals... I feel guilty when I masturbate...\" each followed by TRUE and FALSE boxes. \nB. A WHITE-WALLED ROOM:  Schuyler concentrates on a drawing held by a stone-faced PSYCHOLOGIST, a TAT test; he laughs as he speaks into a tape-recorder, analyzing the pictures. \nC. X-CLOSE:  The DRAWING, a large ant with an apron feeding a TV dinner to a human child.  The card moves just as we register it to reveal another DRAWING of a smiling man toppling backwards in a chair, perched on the edge of a cliff. \nD. A LAB:  Electronic MONITORS and PRINTERS record Schuyler's EEG and EKG.  We see him on a doctor's table, wearing a medical gown with the CRS logo.  He's hooked up to the wires, a female TECHNICIAN studying the readouts while a NURSE takes his blood pressure. \nE. X-CLOSE:  The traveling trace of intersecting colored waves. \nF. A DARKENED ROOM:  Schuyler in FG, still in the gown, watches a screen as images FLASH-- geometric SHAPES, WORDS, PHOTOS.  His finger hovers over a bank of three buttons, he presses different ones from time to time.  There's a MIRROR to one side of the room-- \nG. X-CLOSE:  A COMPUTER SCREEN shows green columns of NUMBERS-- SCHUYLER'S NAME is steady at the top of the screen, with an account number.  CAMERA MOVES FROM THE SCREEN to show an unseen COMPUTER OPERATOR watching Schuyler through the one-way glass. \nThe CACOPHONY of the MONTAGE ends abruptly as we CUT TO: \n31.  I N T .   C U B I C L E  -  N I G H T \nSchuyler, in the gown, sits on an examination table with his hands in his lap in a small, featureless cubicle-- he seems vulnerable, looks around blankly.  To himself, irritated and bemused: \nSCHUYLER David, you suck. \nFEINGOLD BURSTS IN, a slew of COMPUTER PRINT-OUTS under his arm. \nFEINGOLD Sorry to keep you waiting, a client's head exploded... (grins) You can get dressed, we're done. \nHe throws open a closet door.  Schuyler reaches inside for his clothes, which are neatly folded and on hangers.  Feingold turns his back on him as he DRESSES, perching on the examination table and studying the unburst print-outs. \nFEINGOLD Looks promising at this point. You test well, you're in decent shape for someone in your tax bracket... Hm, some resistance to the psych questions, but we got the general idea... \nHe heads out, beckons for Schuyler to follow. \n32.  I N T .   C R S   M A I N   F L O O R  -  N I G H T \nFeingold leads him through the office-- SECRETARIES and other WORKERS pack up at the end of the day. \nFEINGOLD We design the game around your schedule, you're free to give it as much or as little time as you wish.  And of course, you can call it quits at any point. \nSCHUYLER This was actually a gift.  Did my brother pay in advance? \nFEINGOLD You'd have to ask our billing department... the price varies.  But our service comes with a guarantee. If you're not satisfied, there's no charge.  And we've never had an unsatisfied customer... \nSCHUYLER You mean dissatisfied. \nFEINGOLD (looking at a form) Mm, that's right-- you're a left- brain word fetishist. \nSCHUYLER I get that all the time. \nFeingold smiles tightly and leads Schuyler back into his office. \n33.  I N T .   F E I N G O L D ' S   O F F I C E  -  D A Y \nCLOSE ON PAPERWORK as it's dropped on the desktop. \nSCHUYLER, CRS pen in hand, looks at this dubiously. \nSCHUYLER So I'm supposed to sign up for a game when I don't know the rules, I don't know the object, I don't know how much it costs... \nFEINGOLD It's a leap of faith.  But at this stage, there's no commitment-- we just need to process your application.  And if you qualify, you're in for the ride of your life.  What have you got to lose? \nSchuyler CLICKS the ballpoint pen, they both lean over the papers. \nFEINGOLD Initials-- initials-- sign here. \nSchuyler's about to sign when Feingold grabs his wrist. \nFEINGOLD In blood. (a WINK) ---Just kidding. \nCLOSE, as Schuyler SIGNS on the dotted line. \nFEINGOLD snatches up the forms, suddenly seems in a hurry for Schuyler to go. \nFEINGOLD Very good, Mr. Van Orton.  Please, keep the pen. \nSchuyler shrugs, sticks it in his breast pocket, starts out. \nSCHUYLER When can I expect to hear-- \nFEINGOLD We'll be in touch. \nFeingold gently shuts the door on schuyler's face. \nS C E N E   3 4   D E L E T E D \nCUT TO: \n35(NEW).

Could you--? \nShe waves a hand at him, \"go away\" and ducks out of view, finishing dressing into punk-grungy street clothes.  She SLAMS the locker, starts to push past him, pulling on her backpack bag. \nSCHUYLER Don't you have something for me? \nCHRISTINE Uh-huh sure, here you go. \nShe puts her hand into her side pocket, pulls it out with her middle finger extended, moving away from him in a hurry. Schuyler's face falls-- he made another mistake. \nSCHUYLER Wait, you really work here-- \nCHRISTINE Not anymore, thanks to you. \nShe's out the SWINGING kitchen door.  Schuyler absorbs his blunder for a moment, then hurries after her. \n56.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y \nSchuyler catches up as Christine hurries toward a MUNI station, LIGHTING a cigarette.  A few PEDESTRIANS come off the steps from the arriving elevated train in this residential SF neighborhood. \nSCHUYLER Slow down-- you don't understand, I thought it was a gag. \nCHRISTINE No, you don't understand.  I carry mace and I know how to use it. \nShe reaches into her purse/backpack, Schuyler backs off. \nSCHUYLER I was only trying to apologize. \nCHRISTINE Shit, it's in here somewhere-- \nSCHUYLER Fine. \nHe starts to move away, then they both hear GASPING O. S.-- \nON THE STEPS, a HEAVY MAN, 60, in a coat and tie has collapsed, struggling for breath, very pale.  Christine and Schuyler are the only pedestrians around now. \nCHRISTINE Shit-- \nShe rushes to help the guy, loosening his tie-- he JOLTS. \nSCHUYLER looks up at them dubiously, brushing a scrap of food still clinging to his suit. \nCHRISTINE reaches in to clear the guy's throat, starting CPR.  She shoots a look at Schuyler. \nCHRISTINE You got a fucking phone, call an ambulance! \nSchuyler approaches slowly, pulling out his phone, studying the guy as Christine gives him mouth-to-mouth. \nSCHUYLER This is just too weird-- it can't be real-- \nCHRISTINE You really are insane! \nSCHUYLER leans close to look at the man. \nON THE MAN'S FACE-- sweating, contorted, unnaturally pale, his eyes rolling back as he GAGS his last... \nCHRISTINE grabs the phone away from Schuyler, dials. \nCHRISTINE We need an ambulance, guy's having a heart attack near the MUNI station at 5th and Market-- (to Schuyler) What's the number on this thing?! \nSCHUYLER I don't give it out-- (off her horrified look) \nCHRISTINE 731-5723-- yeah, thanks-- \nShe stuffs the phone in a pocket and pumps the man's chest, returns to the mouth-to-mouth.  Schuyler looks around uncomfortably, starting to believe this is a real heart attack. \nSCHUYLER Is there anything I can do? \nCHRISTINE ignores him, all attention on saving this guy's life... \n56A. WIDE as an AMBULANCE pulls up, SIREN BLARING.  A couple of MALE PARAMEDICS hurry out with a stretcher. \nON THE STEPS, the two PARAMEDICS lift the unconscious HEAVY MAN onto the stretcher while Christine and Schuyler stand aside.  Both have small EARPIECES that look like hearing aids, with wires into their clothes.  Throughout the following, there's a lot of MEDICAL BUSINESS-- feeding the victim OXYGEN, giving him INJECTIONS, etc. \nPARAMEDIC #1 (to Schuyler) Could you come with us, help us fill out a few forms-- \nSCHUYLER No!  I have work to do-- \nCHRISTINE I'll go. \nShe climbs into the back, they start to shut the doors. \nSCHUYLER Wait a minute, you've got my phone-- \nHe climbs in to get it back, they SLAM THE DOORS and start moving. \nTHE AMBULANCE peels out.  We now see the LOGO on the back: \"CITYWIDE RESCUE SYSTEMS,\" with the C, R and S in RED. \n57.  I N T .   A M B U L A N C E  -  D A Y \nThe PARAMEDICS are intent on the gasping man.  The SIREN BLARES, a bit MUFFLED in here.  Schuyler, looking out the back, is extremely pissed, makes a fist and almost punches the wall of the ambulance. \nCHRISTINE Chill, will you?! \n", "test2_true": "CHRISTINE Neither do I, now siddown, get outta their way! \nA BUMP almost sends him flying atop the stretcher.  Schuyler sits near Christine on a ledge near the back doors.  Petulant: \nSCHUYLER I'd like my phone back please. \nCUT TO: \n58(NEW).  I N T .   H O S P I T A L   E N T R A N C E / G A R A G E  -  D A Y \nAn UNDERGROUND RAMP, signs reading \"EMERGENCY VEHICLES ONLY,\" a set of DOORS leading into the lobby of an EMERGENCY ROOM; MEDICAL PERSONNEL visible inside, INJURED PEOPLE, etc., a few PEOPLE mill outside the doors. \nTHE AMBULANCE SCREECHES to a stop, the back doors fly open, the PARAMEDICS wheel out the dying man and rush into the entrance, automatic doors OPEN and CLOSE for them.  Schuyler and Christine climb out, disoriented, walking more slowly to the doors.  The AMBULANCE pulls away behind them.  Schuyler nearly slips in a mysterious dark PUDDLE. \nSCHUYLER Oh, this day keeps getting better. \nCHRISTINE What is your problem, you think the whole fucking world revolves around you? \nAs she says this, she walks right into the ELECTRIC DOORS, which fail to open for them. \nTHEIR POV-- THROUGH THE DOORS the gathered STAFF and PATIENTS all turn at once to regard Christine and Schuyler.  They GRIN and WINK. \nON SCHUYLER AND CHRISTINE, who barely get the chance to register this before-- \nTHE LIGHTS GO OUT... PITCH BLACKNESS and SUDDEN SILENCE.  We hear only SCHUYLER'S BITTER LAUGHTER.  Dialogue OVER DARKNESS: \nSCHUYLER As a matter of fact... \nCHRISTINE What the fuck is going on?! \nWe hear RUSTLING in a purse, but still see next to nothing. \nSCHUYLER It's a little hard to explain... \nCHRISTINE Try! \nWe hear the STRIKING OF A MATCH, there's some ORANGE LIGHT-- CHRISTINE holds the match.  The whole area is DESERTED, except for the two of them.  SCHUYLER kicks at the glass doors-- they're not going to give, nothing is visible beyond them. \nSCHUYLER I seem to be playing a game.  This is supposed to be funny-- \nCHRISTINE I don't get it. \nSCHUYLER --a challenge, a puzzle. \nCHRISTINE OK, I'm puzzled.  Where are we? \nSCHUYLER has found a STEEL DOOR with a GLOWING RED SIGN:  EMERGENCY USE ONLY.  He yanks it open and a PAIL swings down, dumping WATER on his head.  He's facing a BRICK WALL through the door. \nCHRISTINE can't help but LAUGH, then YELPS in pain as the match burns her fingers.  LIGHTS another.  Schuyler flips open his phone. \nSCHUYLER Damn it, no signal. \nCHRISTINE Here's a lightswitch-- \nSCHUYLER I wouldn't-- \nShe flips it on, A BLINDING STROBE FLASHES for a few seconds-- both CRY OUT-- then the BULB EXPLODES in a shower of sparks. \nSCHUYLER I don't know the rules, if there are any, but it seems the obvious move usually backfires... \nCHRISTINE Of course.  I have no idea what you're talking about. \nThey've taken a few steps forward, exploring the DARK.  She LIGHTS a cigarette with the next match, nearly running into ANOTHER DOOR. She RATTLES it-- locked. \nCHRISTINE Son of a bitch. \nSCHUYLER I think I have a key. \nSchuyler pulls out his keyring and tries the gold CRS key-- nope. \nSCHUYLER Damn it... (a beat, thoughtful) Wrong key... \nCHRISTINE Last match. \nIn the matchlight, we see Schuyler fumbling in his pockets, pulling out the ROSY SUNGLASSES from the Rasta.  He puts them on. \nCHRISTINE Too bright for you, is it? \nSCHUYLER'S POV as the last MATCH GOES OUT-- CHRISTINE GLOWS RED in the matchlight for a moment, then as soon as it goes out, we see a GLOW of FLUORESCENT PAINT on the ground... a series of STRIPES and ARROWS in DIFFERENT COLORS, GLOWING.  These start PARALLEL near where he stands, then RADIATE in different directions.  CHRISTINE is but a SILHOUETTE against the COLORED LINES. \nSCHUYLER I can see now.  Grab my arm. \nCHRISTINE No way!  You're crazy! \nCHRISTINE moves away from him. \nSCHUYLER Stay on the path! \nA BURST OF FLAME erupts from the GROUND close enough to scare the shit out of CHRISTINE, who SCREAMS.  SCHUYLER hurries toward her. \nThe FLAMES VANISH, she lurches in a differrent direction-- \nSCHUYLER Christine, don't move! \nCHRISTINE Leave me alone! \n", "test2_id": 1351, "test3_input": "She LOSES HER FOOTING on a slippery surface, falls, sliding down a gentle SLOPE. \nCHRISTINE Help! \nSCHUYLER follows.  FALLING himself.  They try to reach toward each other for purchase, but it's no good, the slope is getting steeper. \n58A. In a moment SCHUYLER tumbles on top of Christine in a four- foot deep round CHILDREN'S POOL, but it isn't full of water. There's a bit of BLACK LIGHT here, enough to make out-- \n--COCKROACHES, thousands of them, a TEEMING ROIL OF INSECTS in a CHURNING LIQUID.  There's a BUZZING NOISE, both SCREAM. \nCHRISTINE Aaggh!  BUGS!! \nSCHUYLER quickly helps lift Christine out.  She starts to pull him upward, but-- \nSCHUYLER Where are the glasses?! \nCHRISTINE Fuck the glasses! \nSCHUYLER We can't get out of here without them! \nHe steels himself and rummages amidst the bugs, about to get sick, finally coming up with the glasses.  He shakes them free of INSECTS and clambers out to join Christine, who's GASPING and brushing the bugs off of her.  SCHUYLER puts on the glasses and holds up a BUG. \nSCHUYLER They're rubber.  Hold onto me, I'll get us out of here. \nCHRISTINE Ha! \nSCHUYLER Fine, stay. \nCHRISTINE No! \nShe grabs his arm; both are now covered in MUCK from the bug soup. \nSCHUYLER What's your favorite color? \nCHRISTINE ...Blue? \nHe takes off the glasses, puts them on her.  She looks around. \nHER POV-- the RAINBOW of COLORED LINES on the FLOOR... \nCHRISTINE Wow... OK, this is kinda cool.  Hey! \nSCHUYLER slips the glasses off her, puts them back on. \nSCHUYLER Sorry, it's my game.  But we'll take blue. \nHIS POV-- a BLUE LINE moves in a snaking path ahead of them, going in circles now and then, INTERSECTING or moving PARALLEL to other colors, up a series of ramps.  This space sometimes resembles a PARKING GARAGE, scmetimes a SEWER or a STEAM TUNNEL. \nCHRISTINE keeps a hand on Schuyler as he follows the path. \nCHRISTINE Talk about the blind leading the blind... what's your name anyway? \nSCHUYLER Sky Van Orton. \nCHRISTINE Sky?  Were your folks hippies or something? \nSCHUYLER Far from it. \nCHRISTINE I'm Christine Kaminsky. \nSCHUYLER Nice to meet you. \n58B. LATER, CHRISTINE almost hugs Schuyler now, as they move in a seemingly random pattern in the darkness. \nSCHUYLER It's a company called Consumer Recreation Services, CRS.  I never know what's gonna happen next. \nCHRISTINE Well, who does. \nSCHUYLER Until recently, I had a pretty good idea... Duck. \nThe BLUE LINE has led them into a NARROW TUNNEL, soon they're crawling on hands and knees. \nCHRISTINE So are you like a serious masochist, or just really, really bored? \nSCHUYLER I'm sorry, you shouldn't have been dragged into this. \nCHRISTINE Well... I have to tell you something.  Some guy came into Leo's yesterday, showed me your picture, offered me 250 bucks to spill that food on you. \nSCHUYLER Ah. \nCHRISTINE Said it was a practical joke.  I figured what the hell, I can use the money-- I got him up to 500. I hated that fucking job anyway-- \nSCHUYLER Wait, so the heart attack, you knew that was a joke too-- \nCHRISTINE No!  It scared the shit out of me-- \nSCHUYLER But that CPR routine-- \nCHRISTINE I used to be a lifeguard. \nSCHUYLER (points) We're getting somewhere... \nThe TUNNEL has opened up again.  There's even a tiny bit of VISIBLE LIGHT now.  He takes off the glasses, gives them to her. \nHER POV-- the COLORED LINES are all joining up from different directions.  A few steps onward they all converge at a point, like the spokes of a wheel, at a WHITE SPOT on the ground... \n", "test3_true": "A WHITE RING overhead... it looks like the underside of a MANHOLE COVER, with an illuminated CIRCLE OF LIGHT around the rim, a halo. \nCHRISTINE How do we get up there? \nSCHUYLER steps on the circle of WHITE-- it's a BUTTON.  A ROPE LADDER drops down. \n59.  E X T .   W A L K W A Y  -  E V E N I N G \nA MANHOLE COVER slides aside, SCHUYLER climbs out and helps Christine up.  It's a short, covered WOODEN WALKWAY in an alley. \nCHRISTINE Well, that was pointless... but different... kind of fun... \nSCHUYLER Mm, a different kind of fun. What's your middle name? \nCHRISTINE Louise... why? \nSCHUYLER points to some GRAFFITI-- a HEART with \"SVO + CLK.\" \nSCHUYLER You're supposed to be here... they picked you for a reason. \nCHRISTINE But-- why? \nThey start to move shakily down the CONSTRUCTION WALKWAY, both bedraggled, covered in goo.  HANDBILLS cover one wall. \nSCHUYLER Probably knew you'd play Good Samaritan for that guy, drag me along-- but they could have hired an actor for that, less of a risk... \nON THE WALL, a series of HANDBILLS say, \"AREN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMETHING?\"  SCHUYLER puzzles over these as they move, gets to one last one-- \"BEHIND YOU, STUPID.\" \nSCHUYLER looks back toward the end of the alley-- \nA YELLOW DUMPSTER with the logo, \"CONSOLIDATED REFUSE SUPPLY\" and the smaller image of a KEY.  SCHUYLER moves quickly to it, throws open the lid. \nANGLE IN DUMPSTER-- a MOUNTAIN of SHREDDED PAPER. \nSCHUYLER rolls his eyes, sorting through it.  Christine approaches. \nCHRISTINE This is really sick.  I think they're trying to fix us up. \nSCHUYLER Maybe you can't play alone-- \nCHRISTINE Who says I want to play? (a sigh) OK, what the fuck are you doing in the dumpster. \nSCHUYLER There's something in here I need. \nHe climbs inside, dives in... and pops up again in a moment with-- \nCLOSE-- A Z-SHAPED WINDOW CRANK.  Sure enough, there's a KEY embossed on the side. \nSCHUYLER climbs out again, brandishing the small crank. \nCHRISTINE What's that for? \nSCHUYLER I imagine I'll find out. \n60.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  E V E N I N G \nSCHUYLER pockets the crank as he and CHRISTINE emerge from the alley.  PEDESTRIANS give them a wide berth.  To a PASSERBY: \nCHRISTINE What are you looking at? \nSchuyler heads straight for the CRS doors, the large numbers 636 printed above-- it's LOCKED.  He tries his little GOLD KEY on a deadbolt, it's USELESS of course. \nSCHUYLER This is their offices.  We must have been in their garage... my office is just a few blocks from here, we can get cleaned up there. \nHe walks a few steps on, she stands still for a moment, then nods agreeably and follows. \nCUT TO: \n61.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  N I G H T \nSTART ON THE SKYLINE-- SCHUYLER moves from the window, as we hear a DOOR OPEN.  CHRISTINE emerges from the attached dressing area and bath, toweling damp hair, in an oversized Harvard sweatshirt and gym shorts, with a large plastic bag containing her filthy clothes. She looks good, clearly she put some effort into her make-up. \nCHRISTINE Your turn. \nSCHUYLER (moving past her) Find everything you need? \nCHRISTINE You're outta conditioner. \nSCHUYLER My apologies, I'll have it taken care of.  Help yourself to the fridge. \nHe points to a MINI-FRIDGE, shuts the door, a moment later we hear WATER RUNNING.  She looks around the office, letting down her facade.  She seems quite impressed, and intimidated, by the place. She looks back toward the bathroom door-- maybe this guy isn't so bad after all.  From this point, she takes a more seductive tack. \n62.  I N T .   D R E S S I N G   A R E A / B A T H  -  N I G H T \nLATER, Schuyler has cleaned up, is finishing dressing, pulling a pair of jeans over boxer shorts, tucking in a sport shirt. Christine talks through the closed door. \nCHRISTINE (O. S.) So um... how rich are you anyway? \nSCHUYLER (amused) Rich enough.  Bit forward, aren't you? \nCHRISTINE (O. S.) Well, what exactly do you do? \nSCHUYLER Manage investments, some venture capital, I'm on the board of a number of publicly traded companies... \nCHRISTINE (O. S.) So you just like, move money around? \n", "test3_id": 1352}

He passes PETE and JOHN, two middle- aged RICH MEN sitting at a table near the bar; he overhears a snippet of their conversation-- \nJOHN --like fuckin' wildfire, just opened an office in Frisco here-- \nPETE I played my game in New York... What do you think John, will CRS ever go public? \nJOHN (laughs) Not likely, would you? \nSchuyler slows down, eavesdropping, then moves toward the bar, addresses the BARTENDER with a nod toward John and Pete. \nSCHUYLER New members? \nBARTENDER I believe so. \nSCHUYLER This round's on me. \nSchuyler moves casually toward the men-- \nDISSOLVE TO: \n38(N). SAME LOCATION, LATER, the bartender brings another round of drinks to the table, Schuyler and the men have been chatting a while, all seem relaxed.  Pete, the friendlier (drunker) of the two, puffs a CIGAR as he speaks: \nPETE ...last time I played Pebble, I swore I'd never pick up a club again... \nThe others CHUCKLE knowingly.  Schuyler sips his drink, blinking and coughing discretely at the smoke; there's a slight pause. \nSCHUYLER Great thing about golf, the way it takes you out of your life... Speaking of games-- I take it you two are familiar with CRS...? \nJOHN Uh-oh.  Time to piss... \nHe slides off his stool.  Pete studies Schuyler, sizing him up. \nPETE Why do you ask, Schuyler? \nSCHUYLER I couldn't help overhearing-- \nPETE We don't usually talk about it. \nSCHUYLER I only bring it up because, well, I recently tested for it. \nPETE Did you?  Kudos. \nSCHUYLER I just wasn't sure if they're for real, whether it's worth it-- \nPETE Worth it... Gee, I dunno... they did save my fucking life... \nSCHUYLER Sorry? \nPETE Look, I don't know you, you don't know me, but... I hit a certain point, nothing meant anything.  My work, the wife and kids-- hell with 'em, I was sick of it all, y'know?  But CRS... they changed everything.  \"Are they for real?\"  Who cares, maybe nothing is. (raises his glass) To reality. \nSchuyler raises his glass, numbed by this outpouring.  Pete drains his drink, chuckling to himself.  His friend comes back, looking concerned, takes the man's arm. \nJOHN C'mon Pete. \nPETE (winks at Schuyler) Good luck, pal.

MURMURING CONTINUES during Plympton's address. \nPLYMPTON Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Postponing the Baer-Grace meeting is out of the question.  Schuyler gets on a plane for Washington tomorrow morning at seven with every contract, every side agreement, the complete closing package! \nSchuyler has been going through paperwork in the back of the room, he steps forward during the above. \nLAWYER But there's simply no-- \nTHWAP!

We apologize, we hope it hasn't caused you any inconvenience-- \nSCHUYLER This is absurd-- \nCYNTHIA (filter) Thank you for thinking of CRS. \nCLICK and a DIAL TONE.  Schuyler shuts the phone and replaces it in his pocket, his mind suddenly far away from the meeting at hand. PLYMPTON, a wel1-meaning man with a fatherly attitude toward Schuyler, steps close to him and speaks quietly, concerned: \nPLYMPTON Bad news, Sky? \nSCHUYLER No, nothing.  Sorry, Bob.

You dead? \nHe crouches by the wino, winces at a strong smell, covers his nose. He reaches out to touch the body, but hesitates, pulls back.  Alive or dead, he doesn't want to have anything to do with this person. \nSCHUYLER Shit, shit, shit... \nThe \"wino\" suddenly SPRINGS UP like a jack-in-the-box, bending backwards impossibly at the hips.  Schuyler lets out a CRY and scrambles back toward his car. \nTHE HEAD swivels to face him-- it's a grotesque HARLEQUIN, its head made of COLORED GLASS, LIT from within.  The MOUTH DROPS OPEN and a tongue in the shape of a corkscrew SPRINGS OUT. \nA SMALL KEY ON A HOOK dangles from the tip of the tongue.  One of the harlequin's glass eyes WINKS. \nSCHUYLER stares in amazement for a few moments. \nCLOSE on the dangling KEY as Schuyler fingers it.

He's been packing a leather GARMENT BAG, which hangs from a door, slips the toiletries into a \"side pouch.

David runs, full tilt, into the woods near the Japanese Tea Garden. \nSCHUYLER pursues amidst the trees and vegetation, running out of breath, calling after David, who's vanished.  He leans against a tree, PANTING, dabbing at his bleeding nose with a SCRAP OF TISSUE from his pocket.  He hears a PHONE RINGING, moves toward it, emerging through bushes near the ACADEMY OF SCIENCE... \nHe pauses at the RINGING PAYPHONE.  He decides not to pick it up, looking around at the deserted MUSEUM BUILDINGS and hurrying toward civilization.  He passes other PAYPHONES en route to the park exit... each one STARTS RINGING as he approaches it.  He moves faster, freaked.  At the edge of the park, he snatches one up-- \nSCHUYLER (on phone) What have you done to my brother, you bastards?!  This is over, I'm not playing anymore-- (beat) Hello, is anyone there-- \nPHONE VOICE If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and dial again-- if you need help-- \nSCHUYLER slams the phone down.

Then he looks out, narrows his eyes and RAPS on the PLEXIGLAS PARTITION. \nSCHUYLER You're heading the wrong way. \nCABBIE (filter) Relax, pal, you'll get where you're going. \nThe cabbie turns IN PROFILE for a moment.  He appears to be wearing a HEARING AID, a round piece of plastic, a tiny WIRE disappearing into his shirt.  And there's something familiar about his face. Schuyler glances at the driver ID on the back of the seat-- \nCLOSE ON PHOTO, the man is the RASTA from the airport, with a new hairdo.  The COMPANY NAME-- \"CONSOLIDATED REGENCY SEDANS.\"  CRS. \nSCHUYLER rubs his head, very angry. \nSCHUYLER Why are you doing this-- \nCABBIE/RASTA (filter) We do it all for you!  We're the best friends you got, no one ever worked so hard to make you feel alive... but you gotta let it happen... \nThe cab STOPS at a RED LIGHT.

She could be a Playboy centerfold. \nSCHUYLER Uh, no.  I'm fine.  These fit... (buttoning his pants) ...perfectly. \nHe turns slowly, just as the girl reaches behind her. \nGIRL Sure I can't do something for you? \nShe WINKS as she lets her top drop.  Schuyler smiles strangely. She takes this for lust, approaches him with open arms.  He GRABS her by the hair.  Menacingly: \nSCHUYLER I am finished playing. \nGIRL OW!  Let go! \nShe pounds at him, tries to kick.  He wrestles her to the floor, kneels on top of her.  He seems about to hit her. \nSCHUYLER This has got to fucking STOP! \nGIRL You're hurting me! \nSCHUYLER Who are you!? \nGIRL I just got hired to show you a good time!  C'mon please get off me... \nSchuyler gets his rage under control, horrified at himself.

They said you had this wild fantasy, I should just wait in the boat... \nSchuyler realizes he's not going to get anything more out of her, pulls on a shirt, grabs his wet clothes and leaves the cabin. \n95.

FRESH FLOWERS surround his resting place, otherwise everything is completely DECAYED. \nBy the time SCHUYLER gets out of the coffin, his arms are BLOODIED. He's been dressed in an ALL-WHITE BURIAL SUIT.  A RED ROSE is TAPED to his chest.  He blinks and stares about wildly-- \nHIS POV-- BLURRY, can't make out much. \nSCHUYLER blinks, breathing hard, utterly freaked.  He notices the ROSE on his chest, tears it off, SNIFFS it, then THROWS IT aside with a frustrated CRY.  He stumbles to the heavy door of the crypt, tugs, then realizes it opens the other way-- he gives it a PUSH-- \n142.  E X T .   C E M E T E R Y  -  D A Y \nIT COLLAPSES immediately.  SCHUYLER tumbles out of the crypt into the HOT SUNLIGHT.  He's in a ramshackle city of the dead, a SPANISH GRAVEYARD.  There are endless rows of TOMBS, rioting tropical VEGETATION, many FLOWERS, impossibly bright COLORS.  It should be quite beautiful and peaceful... \nSCHUYLER What? \nHe walks around tentatively, SQUINTING.  AN OLD WOMAN in black sits contemplating a grave, fingering her rosary.  SCHUYLER slips a hand absently into his pocket, and finds something there, pulls it out-- \nSCHUYLER'S POV-- BLURRY shot of a NOTE in SPANISH, with a KEY on the stationery... \nSCHUYLER blinks, slips the note in his pocket. \nCUT TO: \n143.

He grabs a DARK MAN. \nSCHUYLER Where am I?! \nThe man replies with an EXCLAMATION in SPANISH, pushes Schuyler away, CAMERA TUMBLES-- \nOBJECTIVE SHOT-- Schuyler's on his knees in the middle of this third-world thoroughfare, utterly disoriented.  STREET VENDORS sell weird-looking foods, squads of SQLDIERS march with rifles, MUSICIANS PLAY odd instruments... Schuyler clutches his head, as if trying to wish it all away. \nA COP IN BEIGE UNIFORM suddenly prods at him with a nightstick, YELLING AT HIM in SPANISH to move on. \nSCHUYLER'S POV-- the COP looming over him, a BLURRY menace, the end of the nightstick SHARP in FG as it POKES at him. \nANOTHER ANGLE-- Schuyler pleads with the man: \nSCHUYLER Please, help me, I'm an American! I'm lost!  Please!! \nThis doesn't seem to help.  He tries to get away from the stick, but the cop pursues.  He bangs into people as he tries to move quickly, the stick right behind him. \nSchuyler FALLS over a BEGGAR on the ground, in far worse shape than he is.  The cop YELLS at him.  Schuyler covers his head, holding out the NOTE WITH THE KEY, which the cop finally snatches away.  He studies it for a moment, then BARKS with LAUGHTER. \nSCHUYLER'S POV-- the cop reaches down to him-- \nOBJECTIVE ANGLE-- Schuyler cringes, expecting a blow, but the cop just pulls him to his feet.

There's one other CUSTOMER, a shabbily-dressed but honest-looking HONDURAN MAN, looking through a BIN full of sports equipment.  He seems to have been eavesdropping, the pawn shop owner now exchanges a few words with him IN SPANISH, clearly they're coming to some kind of deal.  Meanwhile, Schuyler puts on a rhinestone-studded pair of woman's glasses, looks around. \nSCHUYLER Huh, close enough... \nPAWN SHOP OWNER I throw them in.

He munches on a mango, peeks out a hole in the tarp at the passing scenery. \nHIS POV-- a VISTA of spectacular beauty, ideally jungle-encrusted MAYAN RUINS against the backdrop of the rising sun. \nSCHUYLER's quite taken with the view, despite his troubles. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n149.

INT. TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
They cross a huge foyer, passing a big sign reading `TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS INC' to the elevator. 
ARTHUR But what if this is the one? 
HOBSON This is just like the Komodo dragon. Everyone else is happy to see one in the zoo and leave it there. You had to own one. Thank goodness that handbag manufacturer was prepared to take the poor lizard away. 
ARTHUR (HORRIFIED) You said he's in London Zoo! 
HOBSON He is, Arthur. Are you the only one allowed to joke now? 
INT. TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS. RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
Reception is manned by GRANT, a too-cool-for-school, young Aryan beefcake straight out of an Abercrombie & Fitch spread. Arthur and Hobson enter. 
ARTHUR I don't like it here. 
HOBSON Of course you don't. People work here. 
GRANT (HATES ARTHUR) Good afternoon, Mr Bach-Templemead. 
ARTHUR Hi Grant. Tell me - which of your parents are you most like? Abercrombie or Fitch? 
GRANT (doesn't get the joke) I have no connection with that store. My family name is Von Krausehoff. Take a seat please. 
Arthur and Hobson sit down. Grant picks up a phone. 
GRANT (CONT'D) Vivienne? (conspiratorial, flirty) White mid-rise briefs...mmmm. 
HOBSON Don't fret, Arthur. This won't take long. Then we'll have ice cream. 
A LARGE OFFICE DOOR opens spookily of its own accord. 
VIVIENNE (O.S.) Come in, Arthur. 
Arthur heads to the door. VIVIENNE BACH-TEMPLEMEAD a formidable, tanned American widow in her sixties, shakes his hand. 
VIVIENNE (CONT'D) Arthur. 
ARTHUR Vivienne. 
VIVIENNE You know I prefer `mother'. 
ARTHUR I'm sorry. You look more like a Vivienne. 
Vivienne nods to Hobson as the door to her lair shuts. An icy breeze passes between biological mother and surrogate. 
INT. VIVIENNE'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
The office boasts many glass cases full of trophies and framed photos of Vivienne's younger self showjumping and holding trophies aloft. There's one small photo of Vivienne, Arthur's late father GERALD and Arthur as a toddler. 
Vivienne's engrossed in a document, making notations. Arthur, clearly uncomfortable here, sits in a low sofa before her. 
VIVIENNE (not looking up) So. How are you, Arthur? 
ARTHUR Quite busy. I have a riding boot shoot for Petrie Dressage... 
But Vivienne's buried in her work, not listening. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) What else...I'm meeting Ivanka Trump for brunch to discuss the environment. She's sending her helicopter to avoid the traffic... 
Vivienne's still not listening. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Crashed my Batmobile into the bronze bull on Wall Street... 
She's still not listening. Has it always been like this? 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) ...which caused a hole to swallow up the New York Stock Exchange... 
She's still not listening. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) ..the world economy to collapse and the planet to descend into looting and cannibalism. 
Still not listening. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) What else? Um...tripped over in the shower this morning. Head split open, found a family of meerkats hiding in there! Hated the thought of the little lads being homeless so I bricked up the remaining half of my brain, popped them back in and Hobson glued my skull back together. 
Still not listening. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) I'm thinking of buying a giant. I think the market's right for it.

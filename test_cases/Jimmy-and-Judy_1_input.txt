No movement. 
No movement. 
No movement. 
She begins to breath heavily. 
Then no movement. 
She leans her head down towards the floor. 
Then no movement. 
Still no movement or any reaction for that matter.   It's like she is in a trance and can't wake up. 
Jimmy (O.C.) continues to roll without budging. 
Still no movement. 
It looks like she's about to turn around. She moves her head in the direction of the camera, then assumes her original position facing the TV. 
Then... no movement. 
Still no movement. 
Then Judy collapses onto the bed. Jimmy, still rolling, gets off the bed and begins filming her as she lies on the floor crying hysterically. 
Judy cries and cries and cries and cries. She then lets out a cry from the depths of her soul. The cry is long, hard, and loud. 
Jimmy gets up, then stands above her with the camera. 
She rolls over on her back and is now facing directly into the camera. She tries to collect herself. 
JUDY Why did you do that? 
JIMMY (O.C.) I had to. 
JUDY Why? 
JIMMY (O.C.) I did it for you. 
JUDY I don't understand. 
Judy tries hard to stop, but just sobs harder and louder than before. 
JUDY Please tell me. 
JIMMY (O.C.) I felt like if I didn't save you then no one else would. 
JUDY (screams) Please turn off the FUCKING CAMERA! 
A muffled voice comes through the door from downstairs. 
JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.) Jimmy! What the hell are you guys doing up there? 
Judy stops, realizing suddenly that she's been screaming. 
Camera shuts down. 
CAMERA ON: 
INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY/ENTRYWAY/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Jimmy's behind the camera. He stands at the head of the stairs shooting down. Sounds of a dinner party just getting started come from downstairs. He walks down the steps into the party. 
A generic "Happy Twentieth Anniversary" sign hangs above the front door. Camera pans awkwardly to a lame K-Mart style studio portrait on the wall. It's Jimmy's parents wearing saccharine sweet smiles, Dad's hair slicked back, Mom in an overdone hair-do and in way too colorful clothing. 
Gifts sit on the entry-way table. Party Guests are dressed nicely and are mingling in the house, drinks in hand. Dinner is yet to start. As Jimmy moves into the... 
ENTRY-WAY 
People at the party all turn to camera, a look of shock on their faces as Jimmy walks through. 
More and more people react with gasps and revulsion at camera, but we can't tell why. Jimmy moves camera to the... 
LIVING ROOM 
The place is full of More Party Guests. Frame moves across a huge mirror on the wall over a cocktail bar. We catch a glimpse of Jimmy's image and realize... 
Jimmy is completely NAKED and has PAINTED HIS ENTIRE BODY SILVER. 
Camera quickly turns away from the mirror as some people run from the room. 
One of the Female Party Guests (#1) SCREAMS. 
FEMALE PARTY GUEST #1 (covers her mouth) Oh my God! 
Jimmy keeps filming, catching people's reactions. 
He points the camera at a Female Party Guest #2. 
JIMMY (O.C.) Hey, great party, huh? I'm making a tape for my parents. Want to say something to them?

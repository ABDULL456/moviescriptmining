HARRY But don't worry... he can never use it without Plutonium. 
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.) He's got the Plutonium, and he's on his way back to the lab! And he's got two prisoners with him... Liz and Flash! 
HARRY Don't worry... he needs a huge amount of power... thousands of volts of electricity... to get to the Anti-Force. 
SPIDER-MAN He can get to the power. Electrical power... to the max. Nuclear power... SL 270. And now, at the moment of full Planetary Conjunction. When all the planets line up with the sun... maximum gravitational power. The Conjunction is Ock's final power source. 
HARRY Damn... the Conjunction is due at midnight! What are we going to do? 
EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT 
The BLUE MG arrives and comes to a stop. OCK looks at his two prisoners in the back seat and smiles to himself... Picks up one DRUM on each shoulder. 
OCK Okey, dokey... have fun, young ones... for the last time. 
OCK leaves. LIZ and FLASH are tied together in the back seat of the CAR. 
LIZ (still ministering) What do we do now? 
FLASH We kiss the world goodbye. If he is right, all there is left to do is... 
LIZ Wait... I think I can release my right hand... 
INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
HARRY How much time is left? Wait... I can find out... my God... 59 minutes! 
INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT 
SPIDER-MAN The only way we can interfere with Ock's plan is to find a computer center... fast. 
HARRY (V.O.) Our University has the biggest center in town. 
SPIDER-MAN Yeah, but who's gonna work 'em? 
EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT 
Professor OCK comes for some more drums. He sees that LIZ and FLASH have disappeared. OCK picks up TWO DRUMS. HARRY seeing FLASH and LIZ come running to the school grounds. 
HARRY I think I can get some help... I can teach anyone how to work a code in five minutes. 
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.) Then do it! 
INT. COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT 
The LIGHTS are off, but the COMPUTERS are on. HARRY looks over LIZ'S shoulder as she cracks through a code. Her SCREEN reads out, "CONNECTICUT. TECH. Fully Op, Line Backlog, Security Max Level." The last line is FLASHING. 
KIM Hey, this is easy. 
They all run from COMPUTER to COMPUTER. 
FLASH Hey, Harry I need help. 
HARRY Coming! 
HARRY types in KARNAKY LTD and gets the same response. He looks at his DIGITAL WRISTWATCH. "01:00:02" becomes "00:59:59" as we watch. Then a WARNING BUZZER! 
KIM I got one! I got one! 
LIZ Harry! Get over here! 
HARRY hurries to KIM'S side and elbows her out of the CHAIR. The SCREEN is flashing "WARNING, Security Breach!" HARRY'S hands fly over the keys. The KIDS gather around. LINE DRAWINGS of the CYCLOTRON (progressing from large to small detail) appear one after the other. Finally, a PIPE. There is a CIRCLE around a JOINT. And the legend "H20". 
HARRY A goddamn water leak... 
FLASH Hey, look at this. Empire State University. This is our cyclotron, right? 
HARRY (serious) What does it say? 
FLASH (hits two keys) It says "no information on net." 
HARRY Damn... we can't do it... 
KIM You mean... we can't stop loony Ock... 
HARRY I mean the world is in danger... 
FLASH We must find Peter, he knows these computers better than all of us. 
HARRY Yes, but where the hell is he? 
LIZ (mysteriously) I bet he is with Spider-Man... 
Suddenly the lights dim. A heavy noise. An earth quake. 
EXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK 
The EARTH is moving into line with the other PLANETS of the CONJUNCTION.

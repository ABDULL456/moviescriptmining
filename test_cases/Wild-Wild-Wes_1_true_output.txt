EYE-CROSSED REB Hey, c'mere!   Who the hell are you anyway?! 
McGRATH She's... mine! 
Blam! McGrath emphasizes his claim by gut-shooting the Reb. The shot makes Dora/Gordon jump and the room go quiet. As the Reb crumples, McGrath turns back to Gordon/Dora, oddly inspired. 
McGRATH I feel like... a ditty! 
GORDON/DORA A ditty? But General... (trying to be coquettish again) ... my talents really lay elsewhere. 
McGRATH Nothing stokes the fire in my loins like a ditty. 
McGrath hauls him/her over to the piano player. 
McGRATH You've got some pretty fair lungs on ya, girl, now use 'em! 
He punctuates with a slap to Gordon/Dora's rump.      The other singer (Rita) watches too. 
17   INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT                                           17 
Gordon/Dora is sweating. Reluctantly, he/she whispers something to the piano player. He clears his throat and begins singing. 
(CONTINUED) 
17   CONTINUED:                                                      17 
GORDON/DORA (weakly) 'Buy a drink for the boys In the backroom for me...' 
18   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - WILD WAGON RIDE - NIGHT                     18 
West spots the contents of an open box.    Eyes widen. 
CLOSE - BOX - DOZEN GLASS VIALS 
stuck in sand. But clinking together ominously as the wagon races over the cobblestones. 
WEST Backwards-ass bumpkins got a wagon full of nitro...! 
West tries to steady the glass vials with his hands... but it's no use. He quickly climbs over the boxes, onto the buckboard seat. But the reins are dragging on the ground beneath the frothing horses. 
West leaps onto the horses as the wagon careens down the street. He pulls himself over the first one's neck... onto the next horse. And as he tries for the lead horse, he falls between them! 
19   INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT                                          19 
Gordon/Dora singing. He/she struggles through the song in a very tough room. 
GORDON/DORA 'And tell them I tried... And tell them I cried...' 
Just when it looks like the stone-faced rowdies might rip him/her apart, McGrath starts tapping a mud-caked toe. Encouraged, Gordon/Dora belts out the next verses OVER... 
20   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - WILD WAGON RIDE - NIGHT                     20 
West's custom boots drag in the dirt as he's about to be trampled under the hooves of the freaked-out horses. And if he hasn't got enough problems, the lynch pin attaching the team to the wagon has almost worked its way out. 
CLOSE - BACK OF WAGON - NITRO VIALS 
(CONTINUED) 
20   CONTINUED:                                                     20 
CLANKING together like chimes... 
CLOSE - WEST 
Straining with every ounce of strength in his body, he pulls himself up by the harness onto... 
CLOSE - WILD-EYED LEAD HORSE 
West grabs for the halter. 
WEST Whoa now...! 
But it doesn't whoa. The wagon goes around a corner up on two wheels! It's about to tilt over when West grabs both the horses' ears, yanks them back -- screaming into them. 
WEST I said, whoa!!! 
This approach seems to work. 
21   EXT. RISE ABOVE FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT                              21 
The team comes to an abrupt stop... and with it the wagon hanging over the edge of a steep drop. 
Jim carefully climbs off. He slaps the dust on his jacket, straightens the crease in his trousers. When he looks up, a bitter smile. 
WEST Well, well, this is workin' out to be a perfect day. My man... 
HIS POV - VICTORIAN BUILDING - ACROSS STREET 
The tasteful sign under the red light reads: "FAT-CAN CANDY'S." And framed in the window, General McGrath with his singing soiled dove. 
WEST (O.S.) ... General Bloodbath McGrath. 
22   INT. FAT-CAN'S - CLOSE - McGRATH                              22 
McGrath is clapping with the crowd of misfits who are now singing along with Gordon/Dora. He/she's won over the room. 
GORDON/CROWD (rousing finish) And tell them I tried just the same...! 
He/she curtsies to rousing applause. McGrath beams like a man with the fire in his loins roaring. He grabs his little songbird and up the stairs they go. 
Out the WINDOWS, we see West tracking them.    Simul- taneously going up outside steps. 
23   INT. FAT-CAN'S - UPSTAIRS - GORDON/DORA                       23

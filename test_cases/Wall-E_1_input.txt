ON M-O'S DISPLAY 
Reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT" 
The tracks lead to the elevator. M-O's neurosis takes over. Must clean dirt. He makes a radical decision and... ...jumps off his line. Starts methodically cleaning the dirt trail. 
INT. ELEVATOR 
Gopher waits patiently as the floors pass. Wall-E hidden behind the transport. Peeks at Eve. Pets her blank faceplate. 
WALL-E (quiet beeps) [It'll be okay, Eve.] 
The ELEVATOR DOORS suddenly open. 
INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 
DOZENS OF ROBOTS speed along a multi-lane passageway. All following glowing lines on the floor. Wall-E's head whipsaws back and forth. Tries to process it all. Doesn't notice Gopher's transport merge into traffic... ...without him! 
Wall-E shrinks from the high-speed traffic. Timidly attempts to merge. Sticks out one tread... -- Instantly causes a ROBOT PILE-UP. Wall-E boxes up. Guns it. Weaves across all the lines on the floor. Bounces off robots like bumper cars. 
Barely able to navigate the chaos. Takes refuge in the middle of an INTERSECTION. Scans for Eve... 
ON WALL-E'S POV DISPLAY 
...a PAINT-BOT paints a wall sign... ...A GARBAGE-BOT dumps trash into a wall chute... ...Down the hall, Eve's transport glides up a ramp... 
WALL-E EE-VAH! 
Wall-E chases after them. 
INT. UPPER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Wall-E flies up the ramp. Nearly collides with a merging HOVER CHAIR. It blocks his way. Wall-E gains alongside it, and discovers 
A HUMAN PASSENGER 
sitting, reclined, in the chair. He is large, round and soft - like a big baby. Wears a red, BNL jumpsuit. The chair seems to be steering itself. Guided by floor lines, just like the robots. Speaker headrests block his peripheral vision. A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN floats inches in front of his face. He converses with a SECOND PASSENGER on screen: 
PASSENGER #1 Well, I've been in my cabin all morning so let's hover over to the driving range and hit a few virtual balls into space. 
PASSENGER #2 (ON SCREEN) Nah, we did that yesterday. I don't want to do that. 
PASSENGER #1 Well then what do you want to do? 
ON WALL-E 
He looks over his shoulder. Passenger #2 is floating right next to them. Isolated in his own hover chair. Also in a red jumpsuit. Also a big baby. 
PASSENGER #2 I don't know. Something. 
Both humans are totally unaware of the other's presence. They all exit the hallway. Merge into the... 
ECONOMY CLASS COURTYARD 
Wall-E is in awe. Hundreds of floors of GUEST ROOMS rise on all sides. THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS fill the giant space. All reclined and riding on hover chairs. MULTIPLE FLOOR LINES guide their chairs in all directions. 
Humans have become the most extreme form of couch potatoes. Absolutely no reason to ever get up. No purpose. Every one of them engrossed in their video screens. Cocooned in virtual worlds. Over-developed fingers tap ARMREST KEYPADS. The controls allow them to steer... ...order food... ...play games... ...and most of all... 
...CHAT MINDLESSLY with other passengers: 
The CHATTER is deafening. No one notices Wall-E at all. He drives into the endless human traffic. 
MISC. FEMALE PASSENGER Bot, over here! 
A DRINK-BOT floats over to a passenger. Puts a fresh drink in her open hand. Wall-E flows with the traffic into a LARGE TUNNEL.

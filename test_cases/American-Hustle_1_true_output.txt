Ed Malone holds up two packages of cold cuts. Also holding the cold cuts are the two that frisked everyone at Simone's office. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) Whose party we were at when Sydney and I first met. 
Cut to Irving first meeting Sydney. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ALFONSE SIMONE'S OFFICE - DAY - FLASHBACK 
Ed Malone, dressed as Alfonse Simone, steps to camera to shake Richie's hand. 
ED MALONE Alfonse Simone. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANTHONY AMADO'S OFFICE - DAY - BACK TO PRESENT 
EDITH GREENSLY People believe what they want to believe Richie. 
RICHIE DIMASO That's because you conned me! You both fucking conned me. You both got under me. You did! 
IRVING ROSENFELD Well that doesn't sound so good, either. I mean -- and I don't know what you're talking about, but -- let's just assume you want to go with that story. Really? That's the story you want to go with? That's what you want the New York Times to hear? That you got conned by the very con men who you forced to entrap the members of Congress in the first place. That's what you want to go with? That doesn't sound so good for your whole thing. 
Richie looks like he's going to be sick. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D) And how ironic that the most creative minds, the ones who are working hardest to get the economy of New Jersey going, those are the ones that you round up. And why? Because what, they're the easiest to go after? And what about the real bullshit artists? You didn't even come close to the big leagues. Those big guys. The money men. 
RICHIE DIMASO That's what I was trying to go after. 
IRVING ROSENFELD I'm sorry to tell you, you got none of 'em. 
STODDARD THORSEN You know, Richard, I think we may call you as a witness, but otherwise you're done. I think you better go home. 
Richie disoriented, appeals to Stoddard. 
RICHIE DIMASO Stoddard -- 
STODDARD THORSEN Go on home, Richard. 
ELO's "10538 Overture" reprises on the soundtrack. 
EXT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY 
Camera tilts down from the Federal Building to find Richie coming down the stairs, emotional. Richie walks wiping his eyes, his innocence and Edith, lost. 
CUT TO: 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) We took down some very big guys. 
-REP. SANDERS SWARMED BY PHOTOGRAPHERS WALKING OUT OF BUILDING, ESCORTED BY FBI AGENTS. 
-REP. SIMMONS ESCORTED OUT OF CITY HALL. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) Some of whom were just doing business as usual helping their communities or their states. 
-REP. KESHOYGAN IS GRABBED AS HE APPROACHES HIS CAR IN A GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT WITH A BAG FULL OF GROCERIES. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) But some of them knew they had larceny in their blood-- 
-REP. O'CONNELL COVERS HIS FACE AS PHOTOGRAPHERS SWARM HIM AS HE'S ARRESTED OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE AS WIFE AND DAUGHTER LOOK ON. 
CARL ELWAY IS CHELSEA HOTEL OFFICE IN HIS BATHROBE WITH HIS SECRETARY IN TEARS. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) And they even admitted it. 
GREY HAIRED SENATOR HORTON MITCHELL, wife by his side, denies any wrongdoing and is photographed and humiliated as he then sits with her in a Federal car. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) But in all it was six Congressmen, one United States Senator, and my friend, Carmine Polito. 
THE DOOR TO CARMINE'S CLAPBOARD HOUSE OPENS, CARMINE STANDS IN THE DOOR, STARES AT THE AGENTS, HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN IN TEARS STAND BEHIND HIM AS HE SERVED A WARRANT. CARMINE IS HANDCUFFED. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) We gave the two million back so Carmine got the reduced sentence. 18 months. The loss of his friendship would haunt me for the rest of my life. 
CROWDED FEDERAL BUILDING PRESS CONFERENCE - MANY FLASHBULBS AS STODDARD STANDS NEXT TO AMADO WHO MAKES THE ANNOUNCEMENT. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) And when the story was written, Richard Dimaso's name was never mentioned. 
CAMERA PANS THROUGH CROWD TO FIND RICHIE IN THE WAY BACK, LEANING AGAINST A PILLAR. FADE TO WHITE ON HIS SOBERED FACE. 
209   EXT. LONG ISLAND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY                        209 
FADE IN FROM WHITE, PAN DOWN FROM WHITE SKY TO SCHOOLYARD, CHILDREN LEAVING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IRVING AND SYDNEY WALK UP TO THE SCHOOL TO PICK UP DANNY. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) Syd and I moved in together. And Rosalyn -- 
ROSALYN IN A NECK BRACE and off white trench coat and sunglasses - 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD The car is a little dinged up and I'm a little stiff but I don't want to talk about it. 
Irving stares at Rosalyn. 
IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) She would always be interesting. 
Rosalyn gets in to a car, revealing Pete Musane in the driver's seat. Irving leans in. 
PETE MUSANE (to Irving) You know my boss knows you did him a solid. 
IRVING ROSENFELD Yes I did. He never took a nickle so they can't get him for nothing. I was never going to let that happen.

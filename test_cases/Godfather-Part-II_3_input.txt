An exhausted Hyman Roth, ill-shaven, and in shirt-sleeves in taken into custody by a swarm of Customs, and FBI men.  They allow him to be photographed by press people; and television cameramen. 
FBI MAN Mr. Roth, we have to take you into custody. 
ROTH Yes, I know. 
Some flashbulbs go off. 
REPORTER Can you give us your reaction to the High Court of Israel's ruling. 
ROTH I am a retired investor on a pension, and I wished to live there as a Jew  in the twilight of my life... 
LAWYER Mr. Roth is not a well man; he's tired of running. 
ROTH I'm an old man; at my age, it's too late to start worrying. 
REPORTER Is it true you are worth over three hundred million dollars, Mr. Roth? 
ROTH I'm a retired investor, living on a pension... I came home to vote in the Presidential election, because they wouldn't give me an absentee ballot... 
The newsmen and photographers all laugh, as the FBI men move him away. 
CLOSE VIEW 
One of the newspapermen laughing we recognize to be Rocco Lampone. 
He moves closer to Roth, and shoves his revolver right against his head, and in a second, on camera, assassinates Roth.  People scream, as Rocco attempts to run down the airport corridor, limping as he does. 
FBI men easily pick him off. 
FADE OUT. 
EXT. THE DRIVEWAY BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY 
A taxi cab waits by the house; its driver sleeping with a newspaper over his face. 
INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY 
The cleaning woman, Esther, who had been with Kay for years, sits by the dining room table, weeping profusely.  Behind her, in the recreation room, we can see the tableau of Kay sitting on the couch, her little daughter Mary, between her knees, talking quietly about things we cannot hear.  Her son Anthony sits by himself, in another chair by the side of the room. 
MED. VIEW 
Connie comes into the house quickly, and moves toward them. 
CONNIE Kay, you have to go. 
This prompts Esther to weep all the more.  Kay hugs her daughter, and kisses her many times. 
CONNIE You have to hurry; he's coming. 
Kay puts her coat on; then stands, and reaches out for her son. 
KAY Anthony, kiss Mama goodbye. 
He doesn't move. 
CONNIE (angrily) Anthony, you kiss your Mother goodbye! 
He rises, and walks to her.  Hugs her lifelessly. 
MED. CLOSE VIEW 
on Kay, kissing her boy. 
KAY Anthony, say goodbye; your Mama loves you. 
ANTHONY Goodbye. 
She restrains any tears; she has become too strong for tears. Kay starts to go; picks up Mary, kisses her, and starts to go. 
NEW VIEW 
She steps out the kitchen door; then she cannot help herself. Crouches down, outside, and calls to her son. 
KAY Anthony, kiss me once. 
Then she looks up, and slowly rises. 
HER VIEW 
Michael has stepped into the dining room.  He seems older somehow; as though some sickness has taken more years away from him. 
VIEW ON KAY 
looks at him; instinctively, she takes a step back. 
VIEW ON MICHAEL 
slowly steps toward her. 
VIEW ON KAY 
Another step back; the door is still open. 
VIEW ON MICHAEL 
He moves closer to the door; stops, looks at her.  And then closes it obscuring any view of her. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY 
It is late fall -- most of the leaves have fallen on the grounds and there is quite a wind. 
MED. VIEW 
The water is whipped up by the wind, and the waves are high as they break against the pavilion.  We HEAR the MUSIC of time passing, of Michael, of the Godfather over these images. 
VIEW ON THE SWIMMING POOLS 
They have not been used in several months; they are drained and the bottoms are mossy and dark. 
VIEW ON THE MAIN GATE 
Leaves blowing past it; we don't see the button men; only a hint of someone in the gatehouse. 
VIEW ON THE HOUSES 
Some of the houses have had the summer awnings taken down, and put away.  Some of the windows have been boarded up. 
VIEW ON THE KENNELS 
There are still the guard dogs; some sleeping, some moving impatiently. 
As the MUSIC concludes its statement. 
MED. VIEW 
The peninsula of the private Corleone Harbor.  We see the figures of two people, seated at a table. 
MED. VIEW 
Michael sits at a table having a sparse lunch.  He is attended by his sister Connie, who seems to be the closest person now living on the estate with him.  We see from the way she pampers him with his lunch, that she has fallen into the role of a surrogate Mother-Wife.  He seems older than his years, as though his illness, diabetes, has taken its toll.

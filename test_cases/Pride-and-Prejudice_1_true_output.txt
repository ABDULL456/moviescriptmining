MR BENNET Well, my dear, if your daughter does die it will be a comfort to know it was all in pursuit of Mr Bingley. 
MRS BENNET People do not die of colds. 
ELIZABETH Though she might well perish with the shame of having such a mother. Mr Bennet laughs. 
ELIZABETH I am going to Netherfield at once. 
MRS BENNET Nonsense, the horse is with Jane. And the girls took the carriage to town. 
ELIZABETH Then I will walk there. We should not leave Jane alone in her condition. 
MRS BENNET Walk! You will not be fit to be seen by the time you get there.

ELIZABETH I will be fit for Jane which is all I care about.

FOOTMAN Miss Elizabeth Bennet. Lizzie comes in, her face flushed, her skirt covered in mud. She looks ravishing. Darcy stares at her, then quickly rises to his feet. Caroline Bingley, astonished, looks her up and down. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY Good Lord, Miss Bennet. Have you walked here? 
ELIZABETH I'm so sorry. How is my sister? 
DARCY 
(MORE KINDLY) She's upstairs. 
(TO FOOTMAN) Show Miss Bennet the way, Alfred. Lizzie leaves. A beat. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY Goodness, did you see her petticoat? Six inches deep in mud! No response. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY And her hair, so blowsy and untidy! 
DARCY I think her concern for her sister does her credit. A little pause, Caroline recovers. 
CAROLINE BINGLEY Oh yes, its shocking to have a bad cold. I dislike excessively being ill myself.

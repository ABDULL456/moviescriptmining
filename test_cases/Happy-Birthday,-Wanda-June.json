{"test1_input": "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, WANDA JUNE \nHAPPY BIRTHDAY, WANDA JUNE \nby \nKurt Vonnegut \nACT ONE \nSCENE ONE \nSILENCE.  Pitch blackness.  Animal eyes begin to glow in the darkness.  Sounds of the jungle climax in animals fighting. A SINGER is heard singing the first bars of \"All God's Chillun Got Shoes.\"  HAROLD, LOOSELEAF, PENELOPE, and WOODLY stand in a row in the darkness, facing the audience.  They are motionless.  A city skyline in the early evening materializes outside the windows. \nThe lights come up on the living room of a rich man's apartment, which is densely furnished with trophies of hunts and wars.  There is a front door, a door to the master bedroom suite, and a corridor leading to other bedrooms, the kitchen and so on. \nPENELOPE How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't. \nHAROLD I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport. \nWOODLY I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed. \nPENELOPE (to LOOSELEAF) Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel? \nLOOSELEAF (embarrassed) Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows? \nPENELOPE Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash. \nLOOSELEAF I dunno, boy. \nPENELOPE You don't know? \nLOOSELEAF It was a bitch. \nPENELOPE Thank you. (to all) You can leave now.  We'll begin. \nWOODLY (to the audience, making a peace sign) Peace! \nAll but PENELOPE exit. \nPENELOPE (to the audience) This is a tragedy.  When it's done, my face will be as white as the snows of Kilimanjaro. (hyena laughs) My husband, who kills so much, has been missing for eight years.  He disappeared in a light plane over the Amazon Rain Forest, where he hoped to find diamonds as big as cantaloupes.  His pilot was Colonel Looseleaf Harper, who dropped the bomb on Nagasaki. (hyena laughs) I should explain the doorbells in this apartment.  They were built by Abercrombie and Fitch.  They are actual recordings of animal cries. The back doorbell is a hyena, which you've just heard.  The front doorbell is a lion's roar. (to the wings) Would you let them hear it please? (lion roars) Thank you. \nPAUL, her twelve-year-old son, enters from corridor, a sensitive, neatly dressed little rich boys. \nPENELOPE And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared. \nPAUL (radiantly, sappily) He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived. \nPENELOPE (to audience) I told you this was a simple-minded play. \nPAUL Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday. \nPENELOPE I know. \nPAUL Stay home tonight! \nPENELOPE (ruefully, for they have been over this before) Oh, Paul-- \nPAUL You're married!  You've already got a husband! \nPENELOPE He's a ghost! \nPAUL He's alive! \nPENELOPE Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore. \nPAUL If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad? (sick) Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks? \nPENELOPE (resentfully) Thank you, kind sir. \n", "test1_true": "PENELOPE A what kind of doctor? \nPAUL A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer. \nPENELOPE (knowing better) That's an interesting piece of news. \nPAUL You're the only woman he ever took out. \nPENELOPE Not true. \nPAUL Still lives with his mother. \nPENELOPE You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet? \nPAUL How did she lose her feet? \nPENELOPE In a railroad accident many years ago. \nPAUL I was afraid to ask. \nPENELOPE Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother. \nPAUL I didn't know that. \nPENELOPE A lot of people don't. \nPAUL J. Edgar Hoover plays sports. \nPENELOPE I don't really know. \nPAUL To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign. (makes the peace sign and says the word effeminately) Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody. \nLion doorbell roars. \nPENELOPE (cringing) I hate that thing. \nPAUL It's beautiful. \nHe goes to door, admits WOODLY, whom he loathes openly. \nWOODLY (wearing street clothes, carrying a rolled-up poster under his arm) Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope. \nPAUL You're taking Mom out tonight? \nWOODLY (to PENELOPE) You're going out? \nPENELOPE Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight. \nWOODLY Take plenty of cigars. \nPENELOPE (an apology, secret from PAUL) We made the date three months ago. \nWOODLY I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact. \nPENELOPE She quit this afternoon. \nPAUL We don't have a maid any more. \nWOODLY Oh? \nPENELOPE The animals made her sneeze and cry too much. \nWOODLY I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry. (winking at PAUL, acknowledging PAUL's low opinion of him) I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines? \nPENELOPE They made her so sleepy she couldn't work. \nWOODLY Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease. \n", "test1_id": 2595, "test2_input": "PENELOPE I'm saying no--and thank you. \nSHUTTLE I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful. \nPENELOPE You were wonderful. \nSHUTTLE What's so wonderful if I lost the sale? (turning to PAUL) You poor kid. \nPAUL Don't touch me. \nSHUTTLE Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him? \nPAUL No. \nSHUTTLE (moving dazedly toward the front door) All my dreams have suddenly collapsed. (pause) We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope. \nPENELOPE It's true. \nSHUTTLE Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories. \nHe exits. \nSilence.  A toilet flushes loudly and complicatedly. \nPENELOPE Is Norbert still here? \nPAUL No. \nPENELOPE Then who flushed the toilet? \nPAUL Father's friend. \nPENELOPE What's his name? \nPAUL Don't know. \nPENELOPE For Heaven's sakes! \nHAROLD enters, still adjusting his trousers. \nPENELOPE How do you do? \nHAROLD How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here? \nPENELOPE Not at all. \nHAROLD I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again. \nPENELOPE has now recognized him, but attempts to protect herself from shock by pretending that she has not. \nPENELOPE Our family physician has asked me to marry him.  Paul needs the guidance and companionship that only a man can give.  He isn't at all like Harold.  But then again, I'm not the woman I was eight years ago. \nShe slumps into a chair, buries her face in her hands. \nPAUL Mom? \nPENELOPE (pointing weakly) That man is your father. \nPAUL What? \nPENELOPE There stands the loins from which you've sprung. \nPAUL I don't get it. \nPENELOPE It is you, isn't it, Harold? \nHAROLD (enjoying the drama hugely) Yes, wife, it is. (to PAUL) Come here, boy.  Your father is home. \nPAUL Sir? \n", "test2_true": "PAUL goes to HAROLD dazedly.  They embrace clumsily. \nHAROLD                         PAUL Son, son, son...               Father, father, father... \nThey part, unsatisfied and confused.  HAROLD goes to PENELOPE, his arms outstretched. \nHAROLD Wife, wife, wife... \nPENELOPE struggles to her feet, her face blank.  HAROLD embraces her, finds himself wrestling with a rigid, unresponsive object. \nHAROLD Wife, wife, wife... \nHAROLD lets go, backs away from her. \nHAROLD What's the matter? \nPENELOPE (tearful) Give us time. \nHAROLD Like hugging a lamp post. \nPENELOPE Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive. \nHAROLD You were well adjusted to my being dead? \nPENELOPE We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can. \nHAROLD What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour? \nPENELOPE I don't know.  This is a new disease to me. \nHAROLD Disease? \nPENELOPE Situation. \nHAROLD This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be. \nPENELOPE A telegram--a phone call might have helped. \nHAROLD Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed. \nPENELOPE Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock. \nHAROLD You feel that you're behaving as a woman should? \nPENELOPE Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown. \nLion doorbell roars. \nPENELOPE Who's that?  Teddy Roosevelt? \nPAUL answers the door, admits WOODLY. \nWOODLY (to PAUL) Safe and sound, I see. (to HAROLD) Oh--you came back. \nHAROLD I came back. \nPENELOPE You know each other? \nWOODLY We met here earlier this evening. \nPENELOPE How neat.  How keen. \nHAROLD How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope. \nWOODLY A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab. \nHAROLD Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee. \n", "test2_id": 2596, "test3_input": "LOOSELEAF I dunno.  Who knows?  You know-- you're up there, and you're in some plane nobody ever flew before.  You put her into a dive, and everything starts screaming and shaking, and maybe some pipe breaks and squirts oil or gasoline or hydraulic fluid in your face.  You wonder how the hell you ever got in such a mess, and then you pull back on the controls, and you black out for a couple of seconds.  When you come to, everything's usually fairly okay--except maybe you threw up all over yourself.  It's just another job, but you try and tell Alice that. \nHAROLD Insurance! \nSHUTTLE You actually sold insurance! \nLOOSELEAF I tried. (indicating HAROLD) I sold him some.  That was the only insurance I ever sold. \nHyena doorbell laughs. \nSHUTTLE What an awful sound! \nHAROLD Get used to it. (to PAUL) Back door, Paul. \nPAUL exits to the kitchen. \nHAROLD (to SHUTTLE) It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa. \nSHUTTLE I've considered that. \nHAROLD Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have. \nSHUTTLE I just want one true adventure before I die. \nHAROLD That can be arranged. \nPAUL appears at the mouth of the doorway.  He has something amazing to announce. \nPAUL Dad? \nHAROLD Who was it? \nPAUL It's Mom. \nHe steps aside.  PENELOPE appears.  HAROLD and SHUTTLE stand, HAROLD angrily. \nLOOSELEAF (openly, cheerfully) Hi, Penelope. \nHAROLD (to LOOSELEAF) Shut up, you ninny! (to PENELOPE) You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever! \nPENELOPE I came for my clothes. \nHAROLD Sneaking in the back door. \nPENELOPE I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use. \nHAROLD Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation. \nPENELOPE I came for Paul as well. \nHAROLD If he wants to go. \nPENELOPE You took him to the funeral, I hear. \nHAROLD He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now. \nPENELOPE A dozen? \nHAROLD It's a big and busy funeral home. \nPENELOPE (to PAUL) Did you like it, dear? \nHAROLD It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything. \nPENELOPE Unless she has nerve. \nHAROLD More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin? \nPENELOPE He knows you shattered his violin. \n", "test3_true": "PENELOPE He cried. \nHAROLD About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat. \nPENELOPE Two hundred years old. \nHAROLD He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention. \nPENELOPE (moving toward the violin, and, incidentally, placing herself much closer to SHUTTLE) He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now. \nHAROLD (echoing, expressing the futility of such long-term expectations) Hope. \nHe spots the vacuum cleaner, probes it with his toe, asks SHUTTLE with seriousness. \nHAROLD Do you hope with all your heart that someone will be using this vacuum cleaner two hundred years from now? \nSHUTTLE starts to answer, but stops, supposing that he is being made sport of. \nHAROLD Fifty years? \nSHUTTLE You're making a joke. \nHAROLD (not joking) I'm interested in long-term expectations. \nSHUTTLE (flatly, protecting his dignity) It's engineered to last about fifteen years. \nHAROLD (downstage center, addressing the civilized world) Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things. \nPENELOPE (to SHUTTLE, as HAROLD reflects majestically on the emptiness of materialism) You and Harold are friends? \nSHUTTLE (revealing how mixed and worried his feelings are) He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him. \nHAROLD Things. \nPENELOPE You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him? \nSHUTTLE (almost hypnotized) If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out. \nHAROLD (directly to the audience) Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things! \nPENELOPE (to LOOSELEAF) And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know. \nLOOSELEAF I dunno. \nHAROLD (to the audience) Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know? \nHAROLD What's this? \nLOOSELEAF I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know? \nHAROLD In what way, pray tell? \nLOOSELEAF I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad. \nHAROLD Tit for tat--as simple as that. \nLOOSELEAF You never played a violin. \nHAROLD You did? \nLOOSELEAF Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, \"Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again.\" That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, \"Jesus--who could blame her?\" \nHAROLD Maybe it's time you got out. \nLOOSELEAF Me? \nHAROLD You. \n", "test3_id": 2597}

{"train": "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, WANDA JUNE \nHAPPY BIRTHDAY, WANDA JUNE \nby \nKurt Vonnegut \nACT ONE \nSCENE ONE \nSILENCE.  Pitch blackness.  Animal eyes begin to glow in the darkness.  Sounds of the jungle climax in animals fighting. A SINGER is heard singing the first bars of \"All God's Chillun Got Shoes.\"  HAROLD, LOOSELEAF, PENELOPE, and WOODLY stand in a row in the darkness, facing the audience.  They are motionless.  A city skyline in the early evening materializes outside the windows. \nThe lights come up on the living room of a rich man's apartment, which is densely furnished with trophies of hunts and wars.  There is a front door, a door to the master bedroom suite, and a corridor leading to other bedrooms, the kitchen and so on. \nPENELOPE How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't. \nHAROLD I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport. \nWOODLY I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed. \nPENELOPE (to LOOSELEAF) Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel? \nLOOSELEAF (embarrassed) Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows? \nPENELOPE Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash. \nLOOSELEAF I dunno, boy. \nPENELOPE You don't know? \nLOOSELEAF It was a bitch. \nPENELOPE Thank you. (to all) You can leave now.  We'll begin. \nWOODLY (to the audience, making a peace sign) Peace! \nAll but PENELOPE exit. \nPENELOPE (to the audience) This is a tragedy.  When it's done, my face will be as white as the snows of Kilimanjaro. (hyena laughs) My husband, who kills so much, has been missing for eight years.  He disappeared in a light plane over the Amazon Rain Forest, where he hoped to find diamonds as big as cantaloupes.  His pilot was Colonel Looseleaf Harper, who dropped the bomb on Nagasaki. (hyena laughs) I should explain the doorbells in this apartment.  They were built by Abercrombie and Fitch.  They are actual recordings of animal cries. The back doorbell is a hyena, which you've just heard.  The front doorbell is a lion's roar. (to the wings) Would you let them hear it please? (lion roars) Thank you. \nPAUL, her twelve-year-old son, enters from corridor, a sensitive, neatly dressed little rich boys. \nPENELOPE And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared. \nPAUL (radiantly, sappily) He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived. \nPENELOPE (to audience) I told you this was a simple-minded play. \nPAUL Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday. \nPENELOPE I know. \nPAUL Stay home tonight! \nPENELOPE (ruefully, for they have been over this before) Oh, Paul-- \nPAUL You're married!  You've already got a husband! \nPENELOPE He's a ghost! \nPAUL He's alive! \nPENELOPE Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore. \nPAUL If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad? (sick) Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks? \nPENELOPE (resentfully) Thank you, kind sir. \nPAUL Everything stays as it is! \nWOODLY A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat. \nPAUL (hotly) My father! \nWOODLY I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma? \nPAUL Don't worry about it. \nWOODLY How's the fungus around your thumbnail? \nPAUL (concealing the thumb) It's fine! \nWOODLY It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now. (unrolling the poster) Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety. \nPENELOPE (reading) \"War is not healthy for children and other living things.\" How lovely. \nWOODLY No doubt Paul thinks it stinks. \nLion doorbell roars. \nWOODLY I hate that thing. \nPAUL (going to the door) Keeps fairies away! \nHe admits HERB SHUTTLE, who carries an Electrolux vacuum cleaner. \nSHUTTLE (to PAUL affectionately, touching him) Hi kid. (seeing WOODLY) Would you look what the car dragged in. \nWOODLY I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner. \nSHUTTLE Is that a fact? \nWOODLY That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom. \nPENELOPE Please-- \nSHUTTLE He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom. \nPENELOPE I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon. (to all) Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone? \nAll freeze, except for PENELOPE, who comes forward to address the audience.  Lights on set fade as spotlight comes on. \nPENELOPE Most men shunned me--even when I nearly swooned for want of love.  I might as well have been girdled in a chastity belt.  My chastity belt was not made of iron and chains and chickenwire, but of Harold's lethal reputation. \nSHUTTLE comes into the spotlight. \nSHUTTLE I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us. \nPENELOPE Doing what? \nSHUTTLE He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is. \nPENELOPE Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know. \nSHUTTLE He'd assume we had. \nPENELOPE That's something I suppose. \nSHUTTLE All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up. \nPENELOPE I'm glad. \nSHUTTLE I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University. \nPENELOPE I know. \nSHUTTLE If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt. \nWOODLY Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines. \nSHUTTLE (to PAUL) You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day? \nWOODLY He died of a massive rupture. \nSHUTTLE You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny. (to PAUL) Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow. \nWOODLY You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque? (to PAUL) Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains! \nPENELOPE enters from the bedroom, dressed for the fight. She wears barbaric jewelry HAROLD gave her years ago, a jaguar-skin coat over her shoulders. \nPENELOPE (brightly) Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long. \nSHUTTLE Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat. \nPENELOPE Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go? \nWOODLY (sick about the slain jaguars) Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool. \nPENELOPE What? \nWOODLY Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you. \nSHUTTLE She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks. (to PAUL) Your mother looks beautiful--right? (PAUL pointedly declines to answer) Kid? (PAUL walks away from him) Doesn't your mother look nice? (he goes to PAUL, wondering what is wrong) Paul? \nPAUL (smolderingly) I don't care what she wears. \nSHUTTLE Something's made you sore. \nPAUL Don't worry about it. \nSHUTTLE You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong? \nPAUL (close to angry tears) It's my father's birthday--that's all. (facing everybody, raising his voice) That's all.  Who cares about that? \nSHUTTLE (horrified, raising his hand to swear an oath) I had not the slightest inkling. (to PENELOPE, feeling betrayed) Why didn't you say so? \nPAUL (bitterly) She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun! (to PENELOPE) I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it. (to WOODLY) Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far. \nSHUTTLE (reaching out for PAUL) Kid--kid-- \nPAUL (to SHUTTLE) And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts! \nSHUTTLE (reaching out again) What's this? \nPAUL (recoiling) Don't! \nSHUTTLE (aghast) You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight. \nPAUL Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here. \nHe grabs a jacket from a chair.  SHUTTLE is in his way. \nPAUL Don't touch me.  Get out of the way. \nSHUTTLE Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl? \nPENELOPE (to PAUL) Where will you be? \nPAUL Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten. \nSHUTTLE I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment. \nPAUL (at the door) Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too. \nHe exits through front door, slams it. \nSHUTTLE (heartbroken) Kid--kid-- \nWOODLY Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me. \nPENELOPE And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there! \nWOODLY They didn't murder me. \nPENELOPE Paul's only twelve years old. \nWOODLY He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound. \nPENELOPE We've got to rescue him. \nWOODLY If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that. \nPENELOPE He's not your son. \nWOODLY No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, \"You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight.\" (pause) On that we can build. \nPENELOPE It's a jungle out there. \nWOODLY That's been said before. \nPENELOPE He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged. \nLion doorbell roars. \nWOODLY I hate that thing. \nHe opens the door, admits SHUTTLE, who carries a bakery box. \nPENELOPE Did you see him? \nSHUTTLE Yeah. \nPENELOPE Is he all right? \nSHUTTLE Far as I know. \nPENELOPE Is he coming home? \nSHUTTLE He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park. \nPENELOPE The park! \nSHUTTLE It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is! \nSHUTTLE I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another. \nPENELOPE (disgusted with him) You figure! \nSHUTTLE Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake. \nPENELOPE A what? \nSHUTTLE For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake. \nPENELOPE How nice. \nSHUTTLE They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, \"Happy Birthday, Somebody Else.\" \nWOODLY \"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!\" \nSHUTTLE We can take off the \"Wanda June\" with a butter knife. \nPENELOPE Did you talk to Paul? \nSHUTTLE Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door. \nPENELOPE We've got to find him. (preparing to exit through front door) I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last. (to WOODLY) And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home. (to SHUTTLE) That's all he said--the thing about the key? \nWOODLY I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency. \nHAROLD is unstirred. \nWOODLY I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later. \nHAROLD Ahh--then she's still alive. \nWOODLY She's fine.  Please-- \nHAROLD And still Mrs. Harold Ryan? \nWOODLY Will you please go?  An emergency! \nHAROLD She still has just the one child-- the boy? \nHe moves slowly toward the front door, with WOODLY trying to hustle him and LOOSELEAF out. \nWOODLY Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy! \nHAROLD (stopping) And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan? \nWOODLY Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall. \nHAROLD And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters? \nWOODLY Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now! \nHAROLD moves a little more, stops again. \nHAROLD Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all? \nWOODLY (at the end of his patience, blurting) And her fianc\u00e9! \nHAROLD (delighted) And her fianc\u00e9!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman? \nWOODLY I've got to run! \nHe turns out the overhead light. \nHAROLD You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes. \nWOODLY (holding open the front door) I've literally got to run! \nHAROLD I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was. \nAll three exit.  A moment later, HAROLD lets himself and LOOSELEAF in again with a key.  He turns on the light again, roams the room, reacquainting himself with his beloved trophies.  LOOSELEAF is jangled by the adventure.  HAROLD chucks a lioness under her chin. \nHAROLD Miss me, baby? \nLOOSELEAF I dunno, boy. \nHAROLD Hm? \nLOOSELEAF It's a bitch. \nHAROLD (quietly) A bitch. \nLOOSELEAF Didn't recognize you. \nHAROLD We've never met. \nLOOSELEAF I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants. \nHAROLD I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't. \nLOOSELEAF I'm gonna wet my pants. \nHe laughs idiotically. \nHAROLD ignores this, attempts to savor the ghosts in the room. \nLOOSELEAF You know what gets me? \nHAROLD Go home! \nLOOSELEAF Thank God we found the fucking diamonds! \nHAROLD The hell with the diamonds! \nLOOSELEAF You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich. \nHAROLD Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change! \nLOOSELEAF Can I have the Cadillac? \nHAROLD Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care. \nLOOSELEAF What'll you do for transportation? \nHAROLD I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home! \nLOOSELEAF You know what gets me about that Cadillac? \nHAROLD Go home! \nLOOSELEAF When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch. \nHAROLD Go home. \nLOOSELEAF I'm liable to find anything! \nHAROLD That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up. \nLOOSELEAF I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was. \nHAROLD So long, Colonel. \nLOOSELEAF You know what gets me? \nHAROLD (taking hold of LOOSELEAF and steering him to the front door) Let's talk about it some other time. \nLOOSELEAF How short the skirts are. \nHAROLD (opening the door) Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful. \nLOOSELEAF Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone. \nHAROLD shoves him out of the apartment and shuts the door. HAROLD starts to roam the room again, but the lion doorbell roars. \nHAROLD (going to the door) Hell! \nHAROLD opens the door.  LOOSELEAF comes in. \nLOOSELEAF You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy! \nHAROLD Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months! \nLOOSELEAF Months? \nHAROLD I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways. \nLOOSELEAF (bleakly, shrugging) I'm lonesome already. \nHe exits. \nHAROLD (roaming the room again) The moon.  The new heroism--put a village idiot into a pressure cooker, seal it up tight, and shoot him at the moon. (to his portrait) Hello there, young man.  In case you're wondering, I could beat the shit out of you.  And any woman choosing between us--sorry, kid, she'd choose me. (pleased with the room) I must say, this room is very much as I left it. (sees the cake) What's this?  A cake? \"Happy Birthday, Wanda June\"?  Who the hell is Wanda June? \nBlackout. \nPAUL (slightly dismayed at such murderousness) \"The sting.\" \nHAROLD Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis. \nPAUL Tell me that. \nHAROLD I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand. \nPAUL (his excitement rising) Tell me that!  Tell me that! \nHAROLD Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia. \nPAUL Wow. \nHAROLD We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name! \nPAUL Mhravitch. \nHAROLD We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound. \nPAUL (involuntarily) Uck. \nHAROLD Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet? \nPAUL I don't know. \nHAROLD The story gets hairier.  Should I stop? \nPAUL Go on. \nHAROLD We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there. \nPAUL Where did you get the poison? \nHAROLD We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time. \nPAUL And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, \"Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia.\" \nBlackout. \nSCENE SEVEN \nSILENCE.  Pitch blackness.  The sounds of a Nazi rally come up slowly: \"Sieg Heil!  Sieg Heil!  Sieg Heil!\"  Spotlight comes up on MAJOR SIEGFRIED VON KONIGSWALD, and officer in the dreaded SS.  He is in full ceremonial uniform.  The sounds fade. \nVON KONIGSWALD (sadly, resignedly, remembering) Ja ja.  Ja ja. (pause) I am Major Siegfried von Konigswald. They used to call me \"The Beast of Yugoslavia,\" on account of all the people I had tortured and shot--and hanged.  We'd bop 'em on the head. We'd hook 'em up to the electricity. We'd stick 'em with hypodermic syringes full of all kinds of stuff. One time we killed a guy with orange juice.  There was a train wreck, and two of the freight cars were loaded with oranges, so we had oceans of orange juice.  It was a joke--how much orange juice we had. And we were interrogating a guy one day, and he wouldn't talk, and the next thing I know--somebody's filling up this big syringe with orange juice. (pause) There was a guerrilla war going on. You couldn't tell who was a guerrilla and who wasn't. Even if you got one, it was still a civilian you got.  Telling Americans what a guerrilla war is like--that's coals to Newcastle. How do you like that for idiomatic English? \"Coals to Newcastle.\" (laughs) That Harold Ryan--he says he spoke to me in perfect German?  He talks German like my ass chews gum.  I'm glad to hear the wonderful thing he said before he killed me.  I sure didn't understand it the first time around.  I figured he was a Lithuanian or something, which will give you an idea of how wrong you can be.  All I knew was he was very proud about something, and he had a machine pistol, and it was aimed at me.  The woods were full of all kinds of nuts who were proud of some damn thing or other, and they all had guns.  They were always looking for revenge.  You find a way to bottle revenge--that's the end of Schnapps und Coca-Cola. (pause) Harold Ryan said he killed maybe two hundred guys.  I killed a hundred times that many, I bet. That's still peanuts, of course, compared to what that crazy Looseleaf did.  Harold and me--we was doing it the hard way.  I hope the record books will show that. There should be a little star or something by the names of the guys who did it the hard way. (pause) I'm up in Heaven now, like that little Wanda June kid.  I wasn't hit by no ice-cream truck.  Harold Ryan killed me with his bare hands. He was good.  My eyes popped out. My tongue stuck out like a red banana.  I shit in my pants.  It was a mess. (pause) When I got up on the day I died, I said, \"What a beautiful day this is. What a beautiful part of the world.\" The whole planet was beautiful.  Up here I meet guys from other planets. (laughs) We got some really crazy-looking guys up here.  Their planets weren't anywhere near as nice as Earth.  They had clouds all the time.  They never saw a clear blue sky.  They never saw snow.  They never saw an ocean.  They had some little lakes, but you couldn't go swimming in them.  The lakes were acid.  You go swimming, you dissolve.  We got some guys up here who got shoved in them lakes.  They dissolved. (pause) Harold Ryan stopped talking German to me there in Yugoslavia.  He switched to English, so I finally got some kind of idea what he was so burned up about.  He wanted revenge for the guy we killed with orange juice.  I don't know how he ever found out about it.  There was just three of us there when we did it--me and two regular military doctors.  Somebody who cleaned up afterwards must have squealed.  If I'd lived through the war, and they tried me for war crimes and all that, I'd have to tell the court, I guess, \"I was only following orders, as a good soldier should. Hitler told me to kill this guy with orange juice.\" \nBlackout. \nSCENE EIGHT \nDARKNESS.  Lights come up on living room.  HAROLD has just finished telling his true war story to PAUL. \nHAROLD Mhravitch.  Remember that name. \nPAUL Mhravitch. \nHAROLD The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch. \nPAUL When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch. \nHAROLD It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more. \nPAUL Sir? \nHAROLD The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout. (abruptly) Play lots of contact sports? \nPAUL I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt. \nHAROLD You're supposed to get hurt! \nPENELOPE I'm saying no--and thank you. \nSHUTTLE I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful. \nPENELOPE You were wonderful. \nSHUTTLE What's so wonderful if I lost the sale? (turning to PAUL) You poor kid. \nPAUL Don't touch me. \nSHUTTLE Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him? \nPAUL No. \nSHUTTLE (moving dazedly toward the front door) All my dreams have suddenly collapsed. (pause) We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope. \nPENELOPE It's true. \nSHUTTLE Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories. \nHe exits. \nSilence.  A toilet flushes loudly and complicatedly. \nPENELOPE Is Norbert still here? \nPAUL No. \nPENELOPE Then who flushed the toilet? \nPAUL Father's friend. \nPENELOPE What's his name? \nPAUL Don't know. \nPENELOPE For Heaven's sakes! \nHAROLD enters, still adjusting his trousers. \nPENELOPE How do you do? \nHAROLD How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here? \nPENELOPE Not at all. \nHAROLD I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again. \nPENELOPE has now recognized him, but attempts to protect herself from shock by pretending that she has not. \nPENELOPE Our family physician has asked me to marry him.  Paul needs the guidance and companionship that only a man can give.  He isn't at all like Harold.  But then again, I'm not the woman I was eight years ago. \nShe slumps into a chair, buries her face in her hands. \nPAUL Mom? \nPENELOPE (pointing weakly) That man is your father. \nPAUL What? \nPENELOPE There stands the loins from which you've sprung. \nPAUL I don't get it. \nPENELOPE It is you, isn't it, Harold? \nHAROLD (enjoying the drama hugely) Yes, wife, it is. (to PAUL) Come here, boy.  Your father is home. \nPAUL Sir? \nHAROLD enters, drained but recovering.  He chews on a root. He has slept in the shirt and trousers he wore the night before.  He is barefoot.  PAUL knocks again. \nPAUL Dr. Woodly? \nThere is the sound of WOODLY's door opening.  WOODLY and PAUL speak unintelligibly, WOODLY evidently inviting PAUL in for a moment.  WOODLY's door closes. \nHAROLD What's that all about? \nPENELOPE We thought a doctor might help. \nHAROLD Your old beau? \nPENELOPE We thought it was an emergency. \nHAROLD I don't want that chancre mechanic in here. \nPENELOPE He's a very decent man, Harold. \nHAROLD We all are. \nPENELOPE Shouldn't you lie down? \nHAROLD When I'm dead-- (throwing it away) or fucking. \nPENELOPE Paul said you were awfully sick. \nHAROLD I was, I was.  It never lasts long. \nHe hears WOODLY's door open, is alert to WOODLY's approach, continues to speak to PENELOPE absently. \nHAROLD The Indians call it \"Zamba- keetya\"--the little cloudburst. \nWOODLY and PAUL enter.  WOODLY is correctly professional and carries a little black bag. \nWOODLY Ah!  You're ambulatory! \nHAROLD What a brilliant diagnosis! \nPENELOPE You know what I want? (all look at her) I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends. \nHAROLD Nothing would please me more. \nPENELOPE (believing him) Thank God! \nWOODLY (pleased but careful) Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps? \nHAROLD I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats. \nWOODLY You've been bitten by bats? \nHAROLD Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe. \nWOODLY You have chills? \nHAROLD Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: \"the Woodly galloping crud.\" \nWOODLY enjoys the joke and the blooming friendship. \nHAROLD You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure. \nWOODLY I was going to ask. \nHAROLD Pacqualinincheewa root. \nWOODLY Would you say that again? \nHAROLD Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means \"cougar fang.\" Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back. \nWOODLY I've never heard of it. \nHe exits instantly. \nHAROLD Now that's what I call fun. \nPENELOPE Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary. \nHAROLD You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up. \nPENELOPE I did? \nHAROLD We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now. \nPENELOPE A trip, you mean? \nHAROLD I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here. (to PAUL) Go out and play. \nPAUL Play? \nHAROLD Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours. \nPENELOPE He hasn't had breakfast yet. \nHAROLD Buy yourself breakfast. (takes his billfold from his hip pocket, hands PAUL a $100 bill) There we go. \nPAUL A hundred dollars! \nHAROLD The smallest thing I've got. \nPAUL Can I get dressed first? \nHAROLD Make it fast. \nPAUL exits to his bedroom.  HAROLD turns to PENELOPE. \nHAROLD Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon! \nPENELOPE It's so--so stark. \nHAROLD You used to like it stark! \nPENELOPE Just--bang--we have a honeymoon. \nHAROLD (beginning to stalk her cunningly) I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves! \nPENELOPE wants to run, but doesn't. \nHAROLD Good!  You held your ground. \nHAROLD is very close now, but not touching her. \nHAROLD Now--turn around, if you would. \nPENELOPE Turn around? \nHAROLD (laughing) I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around. \nPENELOPE obeys. \nHAROLD I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream. (touches her shoulders gently, expertly) So tense, so tense. \nPENELOPE You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way. \nHAROLD You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time. \nPENELOPE I have a brain. \nHAROLD We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl. \nPAUL (entering, dressed to go out and play) Dad-- \nPENELOPE What happened? \nLOOSELEAF Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, \"Guess who?\" She conked right out. \nPENELOPE How horrible. \nLOOSELEAF Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody? \nHAROLD Could have happened to anybody. \nLOOSELEAF First Nagasaki--now this. \nHAROLD How about breakfast, wife? \nPENELOPE Breakfast? \nHAROLD (as though to a waitress) Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand? \nPENELOPE turns away. \nHAROLD And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice. \nPENELOPE Mrs. Wheeler is dead. \nHAROLD All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler. (regarding LOOSELEAF, resigning himself to being stuck with his company for a little while longer) Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow. \nPENELOPE That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips. \nHAROLD (honestly mystified) Which one? \nPENELOPE (chokingly) \"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.\" \nHAROLD She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that. (suddenly, angrily, slamming a table with his fist) Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow! \nPENELOPE What a honeymoon. \nHAROLD Honeymoon temporarily canceled. (catching sight of PAUL, whose physical appearance really offends him) The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators. \nPENELOPE You're wrong. \nHAROLD Then let me see him go out and get some exercise. (explosively) Right now! \nPAUL goes reeling in terror to the front door, opens it. \nPAUL (to HAROLD, abjectly) What kind of exercise? \nHAROLD Beat the shit out of someone who hates you. \nPAUL exits.  HAROLD pounds on a table. \nHAROLD Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment! \nPENELOPE We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday. \nHAROLD You're a woman, aren't you? \nPENELOPE nods. \nHAROLD Then we have a cook. \nPENELOPE hesitates. \nHAROLD Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now. \nPENELOPE People don't use that word any more. \nHAROLD Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook! \nPENELOPE You leave me so--so without-- without dignity. \nPENELOPE I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me. \nHAROLD That's what you're supposed to say. \nPENELOPE This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness. \nHAROLD You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you! \nPENELOPE I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel. \nHAROLD It couldn't! \nPENELOPE I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours. \nHAROLD (shaking his head) Fish can't feel. \nPENELOPE Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more. (an unexpected, minor insight) Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you. \nHAROLD (sensing danger) Such as?... \nPENELOPE The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots. \nHAROLD Tell me about its sexual roots. \nPENELOPE It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth. \nHAROLD I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had. \nPENELOPE Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there. \nHAROLD Go on. \nPENELOPE (blurting) And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say-- (pause) for revenge. \nHAROLD You learned this in some college course? \nPENELOPE I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that. \nHAROLD (darkly) The doctor. \nPENELOPE Yes. \nHAROLD And what is his most cherished possession? \nPENELOPE (not sensing the drift of the conversation) His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess. \nHAROLD And he keeps it in his apartment? \nPENELOPE (still at sea) Yes. \nHAROLD And no one's there now? \nPENELOPE I don't think so. \nHAROLD That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do. \nPENELOPE (suddenly catching on, sick with fear) What are you going to do? \nHAROLD He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin. \nPENELOPE No you're not! \nHAROLD Why not? \nPENELOPE Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD (promptly and emotionlessly) Goodbye. \nBlackout. \nSCENE TWO \nVON KONIGSWALD                 WANDA JUNE (making peace sign)            (making peace sign) Peace.                         Peace. \nBlackout. SCENE THREE \nSILENCE.  Darkness. \nWOODY WOODPECKER VOICE Ha ha ha ha ha! (pistol shot) You got me, pal. \nSilence.  A baby cries.  Silence.  The lights come up. \nLOOSELEAF Go to the funeral? \nHAROLD Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform! \nLOOSELEAF That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore. \nHAROLD Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare. \nLOOSELEAF Alice would be absolutely tear-ass. \nHAROLD When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear. (raises his glass) To our women. \nLOOSELEAF I didn't know we had any women left. \nHAROLD The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy. \nLOOSELEAF Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap. \nLion doorbell roars. \nHAROLD (going to the door) This could be my next wife. \nHe admits HERB SHUTTLE, who carries a bouquet of roses. \nSHUTTLE (puzzled by HAROLD) Hello. \nHAROLD How are you, honeybunch? \nSHUTTLE Is Penelope in? \nHAROLD The posies are for her? \nSHUTTLE I wanted to apologize. \nHAROLD You've come to the right man. \nSHUTTLE I forgot my vacuum cleaner. \nHAROLD I forget mine for years on end. \nSHUTTLE (suddenly realizing who HAROLD is) Oh my God-- (pause; points) And you are Looseleaf Harper. \nLOOSELEAF Hi. \nSHUTTLE faints. \nHAROLD (crowing) It's what I've dreamed of all my life, Looseleaf!  To have a grown man realize who I was--and faint! (to audience) End of Act Two. \nBlackout. \nACT THREE \nSCENE ONE \nMILDRED enters drunkenly up aisle, sits precariously on apron of stage and speaks to audience. \nMILDRED Two days later.  The afternoon of the day of Looseleaf Harper's mother-in-law's funeral.  You got it?  Two days later. (pause) You know what happened in Heaven today?  There was a tornado.  I'm not kidding you--there was a Goddamn tornado.  Tore up fifty-six houses, a dance pavilion and a Ferris wheel.  Drove a shuffleboard stick clear through a telephone pole.  Nobody got killed.  Nobody ever gets killed.  They just bounce around a lot.  Then they get up-- and start playing shuffleboard. (pause) I never saw a tornado when I was alive, and I grew up in Oklahoma. There's this big, black, funnel- shaped cloud.  Sounds like a railroad train without the whistle. I had to come to Heaven to see a thing like that.  A lot of people got photographs. (pause) After the tornado was over, a man had some film left and he wanted to take pictures of me--to use up the roll.  I don't like people who go around taking pictures of everything. Nothing's real to some people unless they've got photographs. (pause) Two days later--right? \nShe exits clumsily, the way she came.  Silence.  Lights come up on the living room, which has become a pigpen.  LOOSELEAF, HAROLD, SHUTTLE and PAUL sit around a dinner of nearly raw beefsteak set on the coffee table.  LOOSELEAF wears an ill- fitting uniform, which he has rented. \nLOOSELEAF I dunno.  Who knows?  You know-- you're up there, and you're in some plane nobody ever flew before.  You put her into a dive, and everything starts screaming and shaking, and maybe some pipe breaks and squirts oil or gasoline or hydraulic fluid in your face.  You wonder how the hell you ever got in such a mess, and then you pull back on the controls, and you black out for a couple of seconds.  When you come to, everything's usually fairly okay--except maybe you threw up all over yourself.  It's just another job, but you try and tell Alice that. \nHAROLD Insurance! \nSHUTTLE You actually sold insurance! \nLOOSELEAF I tried. (indicating HAROLD) I sold him some.  That was the only insurance I ever sold. \nHyena doorbell laughs. \nSHUTTLE What an awful sound! \nHAROLD Get used to it. (to PAUL) Back door, Paul. \nPAUL exits to the kitchen. \nHAROLD (to SHUTTLE) It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa. \nSHUTTLE I've considered that. \nHAROLD Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have. \nSHUTTLE I just want one true adventure before I die. \nHAROLD That can be arranged. \nPAUL appears at the mouth of the doorway.  He has something amazing to announce. \nPAUL Dad? \nHAROLD Who was it? \nPAUL It's Mom. \nHe steps aside.  PENELOPE appears.  HAROLD and SHUTTLE stand, HAROLD angrily. \nLOOSELEAF (openly, cheerfully) Hi, Penelope. \nHAROLD (to LOOSELEAF) Shut up, you ninny! (to PENELOPE) You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever! \nPENELOPE I came for my clothes. \nHAROLD Sneaking in the back door. \nPENELOPE I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use. \nHAROLD Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation. \nPENELOPE I came for Paul as well. \nHAROLD If he wants to go. \nPENELOPE You took him to the funeral, I hear. \nHAROLD He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now. \nPENELOPE A dozen? \nHAROLD It's a big and busy funeral home. \nPENELOPE (to PAUL) Did you like it, dear? \nHAROLD It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything. \nPENELOPE Unless she has nerve. \nHAROLD More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin? \nPENELOPE He knows you shattered his violin. \nLOOSELEAF Okay. (pause) Okay. \nHAROLD You're an imbecile. \nLOOSELEAF I know you think that. \nHAROLD Everybody thinks that. \nLOOSELEAF Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb. \nHAROLD The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life! \nLOOSELEAF (shaking his head) I don't think so. (pause) It could have been. \nHAROLD If what? \nLOOSELEAF If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, \"Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live.\" \nHAROLD They were enemies.  We were at war. \nLOOSELEAF Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, \"Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much.\" You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb. (pause) I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one. \nHAROLD Goodbye, Looseleaf. \nLOOSELEAF walks around and gathers his things. \nLOOSELEAF So long, you guys. \nPENELOPE What will you do, Colonel? \nLOOSELEAF I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys. \nPENELOPE kisses LOOSELEAF.  Everybody but HAROLD acknowledges his departure is some way.  HAROLD turns his back.  LOOSELEAF exits, closes door.  Silence. \nSHUTTLE Who's going to fly our helicopter now? \nHAROLD (blackly, tautly) What? \nSHUTTLE We got to get another pilot. \nHAROLD For what? \nSHUTTLE For Africa. \nHAROLD Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman? \nSHUTTLE You invited me. \nHAROLD To make an ass of yourself. \nSHUTTLE What went wrong? \nHAROLD We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive. \nSHUTTLE Gee whiz-- \nHAROLD It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us. \nSHUTTLE I wouldn't drop my gun. \nHAROLD You're hollow, like a woman. \nSHUTTLE I'm smarter than Looseleaf. \nHAROLD He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one. \nSHUTTLE (close to tears) How do you know how I'd act in Africa? \nHAROLD Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me! \nWOODLY I agree. \nWOODLY closes the door.  PENELOPE backs away from the phone, drifts toward PAUL, who still holds his rifle. \nHAROLD This is man to man. \nWOODLY It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing? \nHAROLD What brought you back? \nWOODLY The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. \"Honor, \" if you like. \nHAROLD (to PENELOPE) He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are. \nPENELOPE This is suicide. (to PAUL) Go get the police. \nHAROLD Stop! \nPAUL stops. \nHAROLD There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth. (to WOODLY) Am I correct? \nWOODLY Yes. \nHAROLD I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct? \nWOODLY Correct. \nHAROLD What an hallucination! (laughs) Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me. \nWOODLY You haven't heard me yet. \nHAROLD You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess? \nWOODLY We'll find out now, won't we? \nPENELOPE No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death? \nHAROLD There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking. \nWOODLY You're a filthy, rotten bastard. \nHAROLD (pretending to be wounded) Oooooo.  That hurt. \nWOODLY You're old--so old. \nHAROLD Now who's being cruel? \nWOODLY A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs. \nHAROLD We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon. \nPENELOPE takes the rifle from PAUL. \nWOODLY You're a son of a bitch. \nHAROLD Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm. \nPENELOPE (leveling the gun) I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything. \nHAROLD Ah!  The lady is armed. \nPENELOPE I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone. \nHAROLD (to WOODLY) Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way. \nPENELOPE I mean it! \nHAROLD Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun. \nHe bellies and bullies PENELOPE and PAUL out the front door. \nHAROLD Get the police!  No time to lose! \nHe slams the door, turns to WOODLY. \nHAROLD You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that? \nWOODLY I'm high as a kite. \nHAROLD Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again. \nWOODLY You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown. \nHAROLD I love you!  Have a cigar! \nWOODLY (ignoring the cigar) Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete! \nHAROLD I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze? \nWOODLY If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else. \nHAROLD This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that? \nWOODLY You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man. \nHAROLD I'm an honorable clown? \nWOODLY King Arthur. \nHAROLD You hope. \nWOODLY In any event, I will not beg for mercy. \nHAROLD No quarter asked. (taking a sword) No quarter given. \nWOODLY Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew? \nHAROLD (offering sword) Cut me open.  Find out. \nWOODLY I've struck my blow. \nHAROLD With spittle? \nWOODLY I've poisoned you. HAROLD (pointing at WOODLY in horror) Lucretia Borgia? (looking around frantically) Something I drank or touched? (understanding) You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace! \nWOODLY I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, \"Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete,\" and, \"Clown, clown, clown.\" \nHAROLD Poison. \nWOODLY You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, \"Is Harold Ryan really a clown?\" And the answer is, \"Yes.\" \nHAROLD (touching his forehead experimentally) I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there. \nWOODLY You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive? \nHAROLD (blankly, as though in a dream) No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife. \nHAROLD (blankly) I see. \nWOODLY You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself! \nHAROLD (quietly) Don Quixote. \nWOODLY My violin is avenged! \nHAROLD Something seems to have happened to my self-respect. \nWOODLY And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed. \n", "test1_input": "HAROLD Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me. \nPENELOPE What do you do for a living? \nHAROLD My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there. \nPENELOPE Some kind of animal? \nHAROLD The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man. \nBlackout. \nSCENE SIX \nCURTAIN rises on empty living room.  PAUL lets himself in with a key. \nPAUL Mom? (silence) Herb? (silence) Dr. Woodly? (advances into room uneasily) Hello? (sees the cake) A cake?  Who's Wanda June? \nHAROLD enters quietly from the kitchen, holding a can of beer. \nPAUL Anybody home? \nHAROLD As a matter of fact-- \nPAUL (nearly jumping out of his skin) Sir? \nHAROLD As a matter of fact--I am home. \nPAUL (thinking HAROLD may be a burglar) Hello. \nHAROLD (simply) Hello. \nPAUL Are you-- \nHis voice fails him. \nHAROLD (hoping to be recognized) You were about to ask a question? \nPAUL Are you--do you-- \nHAROLD Ask it! \nPAUL (blurting) Do you know who Wanda June is? \nHAROLD Life has denied me that thrill. \nPAUL Do you mind if I ask who you are? \nHAROLD Mind? (aside) God, yes, I mind. (to PAUL) I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago. \nPAUL Dr. Woodly. \nHAROLD Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list. \nPAUL Is anybody besides you here now? \nHAROLD The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth. \nPAUL Where's Mom? \nHAROLD You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night? \nPAUL She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess. \nHAROLD You think you could find me a pencil and paper? \nPAUL I'll see. \nHe rummages through a drawer. \n", "test1_true": "PAUL I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much. (gives HAROLD pencil and paper) When did you know my father? \nHAROLD Man and boy. \nPAUL Everybody says he was so brave. \nHAROLD Even this--\"Herb Shuttle\", you said? \nPAUL He worships Father. \nHAROLD (pleased) Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper? \nPAUL He's a vacuum cleaner salesman. \nHAROLD (deflated) I see. (recovering) And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille-- \nPAUL She met him at college. \nHAROLD (startled) College! \nPAUL They were in the same creative writing class. \nHAROLD College? \nPAUL She has a master's degree in English literature. \nHAROLD What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops. (pause) And the doctor?  He worships your father, too? \nPAUL He insults him all the time. \nHAROLD (delighted) Excellent! \nPAUL What's good about that? \nHAROLD It makes life spicy. \nPAUL He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother. (indicating HAROLD's portrait) You know what he called Father one time? \nHAROLD No. \nPAUL \"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy.\" \nHAROLD (measuring his opponent) What does he do--of an athletic nature? \nPAUL Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet. \nHAROLD Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure. \nPAUL He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War. (pause) Were you in a war with Father? \nHAROLD Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise. \nPAUL Tell me some true stories about Dad. \nHAROLD (unused to the word) \"Dad?\" (accepting it) Dad. (to himself) The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country. \nPAUL England? \nHAROLD (disgusted) Oh hell. \nPAUL Dad was never in England? \nHAROLD Behind a desk for a little while. (contemptuously) A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him \"La Picadura\"--\"the sting.\" \nPAUL (echoing wonderingly) \"The sting.\" \nHAROLD As in \"Death, where is thy sting?\" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more. \n", "test2_input": "WOODLY (puzzled by PENELOPE's mood) Are--are you crying, Penelope? \nHAROLD She's crying because she's so happy. \nPENELOPE That's why I'm crying. \nPAUL Dr. Woodly? (indicating HAROLD) You know who this is? \nWOODLY I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father? \nPAUL He isn't any friend of Father. \nWOODLY He isn't? \nPAUL He is my father. \nWOODLY No! \nPENELOPE Eeeeeeeeeeee-yup.  Dr. Woodly--I would like you to meet Harold, my husband.  Harold, this is Dr. Woodly, my fianc\u00e9. \nShe crosses to the door of the master bedroom, kissing each male lightly as she passes. \nPENELOPE Good night, dear.  Good night, dear. \nShe stands in the doorway. \nPENELOPE Stay or go, talk or sulk, laugh or cry--as you wish.  Do whatever seems called for.  My mind is gone. Good night. \nShe exits into bedroom, closes the door firmly, locks it audibly. \nWOODLY (dazedly) I feel the same way.  What next? \nHAROLD What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is-- \nWOODLY None. \nHAROLD Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc\u00e9 is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night. \nWOODLY (crushed, without any possible comeback) Good night. \nHe exits through the front door.  HAROLD goes at once to PENELOPE's door, tries it, finds it locked. \nHAROLD Penelope!  God damn it!  Penelope! \nHe considers kicking down the door, thinks better of this, turns away. \nHAROLD Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt. \nPAUL Is Looseleaf Harper alive? \nHAROLD Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable? (not waiting for an answer, calling again) Penelope! \nPAUL She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes. \nHAROLD Why don't you go to bed--son. \nPAUL I can't take my eyes off you. \nHAROLD Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you? \nHAROLD Can't it keep till morning? \nPAUL She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, \"Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes.\" \nHAROLD That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning. \nPAUL Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead. \nHAROLD Penelope! \n", "test2_true": "HAROLD Penelope! \nPAUL She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her. \nHAROLD (sharply) Will you go to bed? \nPAUL (stung) Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks. \nHAROLD (stamping his foot) Scat! \nPAUL exits hastily down the corridor to his room.  HAROLD goes to PENELOPE's door, attempts to woo her through it. \nHAROLD Penelope--darling--can you hear me? Wife--you know what kept me alive all these fevered, swampy, nightmare years?  Your heavenly face, Penelope, my wife--shimmering before me, coaxing me up from my knees, begging me to stagger one step closer to home.  Has love ever reached so far?  Has love ever overcome more hardships than mine? (silence) Has love ever asked more manliness of a man, more womanliness of a woman?  Has ever a man done more for a woman's reward? \nThe bedroom door opens, revealing PENELOPE. \nPENELOPE (hollowly, to the world at large) There is no one in here of any earthly use to anyone tonight. Tomorrow is another day. \nShe closes the door and locks it. \nHAROLD (to audience) End of Act One. \nBlackout. \nACT TWO \nSCENE ONE \nDARKNESS.  PAUL, alone in the living room, hammers on his mother's door.  He wears pajamas. \nPAUL Mom!  Mother!  Mom! \nToilet flushes.  Lights come up on the living room.  It is morning. \nPAUL Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom! \nHAROLD (a moment of exhaustion) Damn. \nPAUL Mom? \nDoor to the master bedroom suite opens.  PENELOPE appears in the doorway.  She has decided during an almost sleepless night that she owes it to PAUL and to her own self-respect to explore the possibility of beginning her life with HAROLD anew.  She is terrified of him.  She hopes that if she can keep calm and open, her fears will diminish.  Perhaps she can love him again. \nPENELOPE (attempting to behave mechanically as a good wife should) What are his symptoms? \nPAUL Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do? \nPENELOPE What does he say to do? \nPAUL He can hardly talk. \nHAROLD (responding to a last twinge of nausea) Bluh. \nPENELOPE You'd better get Dr. Woodly. \nPAUL Really? \nPENELOPE It is an emergency, isn't it? \nPAUL (uncertainly) Yeah. \nPENELOPE Then get him. \nPAUL (thinking she has made a mistake) Okay. \nHe exits through front door, leaves door open.  We hear him knocking on a door in the hallway. \nPAUL Dr. Woodly? \n", "test3_input": "PENELOPE Like what? \nHAROLD (becoming dangerously physical, seizing a battle-ax) Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response! \nHe splits a coffee table with the ax. \nPAUL (rushing in with his .22 rifle at a high port arms) Mom? \nHAROLD What's this? \nPAUL wilts instantly, attempts to make his rifle inconspicuous, harmless, meaningless. \nHAROLD What's this? \nPAUL Nothing. \nHAROLD That's a rifle you have? \nPAUL No. \nHAROLD Of course it is.  Is it loaded? \nPAUL No. \nHAROLD Open the bolt! \nPAUL obeys.  A cartridge pops out. \nHAROLD That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it. \nHAROLD Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs. \nPAUL Gee whiz, Dad-- \nHAROLD Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun! \nPAUL (bleatingly) Dad-- \nHAROLD Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!` \nPENELOPE He's a child! \nHAROLD With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy. \nPENELOPE You're begging him to kill you? \nHAROLD If he thinks he's man enough. \nPENELOPE (amazed by sudden insight) That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead. \nHAROLD I'm teaching my son to be a man. \nPENELOPE So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you. \nHAROLD I plan to live one hundred years! \nPENELOPE No you don't. \nHAROLD If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself? \nPENELOPE Honor, I suppose. \nHAROLD What a handsome word. \nPENELOPE (wonderingly) But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed. \nHAROLD If you've lived a good life, fought well-- \nPENELOPE It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all. \n", "test3_true": "PAUL shakes his head. \nHAROLD Load it! \nPAUL refuses. \nHAROLD Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words? \nPAUL I don't want to fight you. \nHAROLD Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home! \nPAUL (weakly) It's your house, Dad. \nHAROLD (throwing up his hands) Everybody simply evaporates! (including the audience, inviting it to share his indignation) There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin. \nPENELOPE The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore. \nHAROLD I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here. \nPENELOPE No. \nHAROLD (emptily, turning away) No. \nPause.  He contemplates PAUL. \nHAROLD And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too? \nPENELOPE I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being. \nHAROLD (to PAUL, quietly) You hope this, too? \nPAUL I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me. (indicating PENELOPE) You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same. \nHAROLD I'm talking to you gently now. \nPAUL Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again. \nPENELOPE He's right, Harold.  To you, we're simply pieces in a game--this one labeled \"woman,\" that one labeled \"son.\" There is no piece labeled \"enemy\" and you are confused. \nLion doorbell roars.  PAUL goes to answer it. \nHAROLD There won't be anybody out there. That's the new style: nobody anywhere. \nPAUL, aghast, admits NORBERT WOODLY.  WOODLY is high as a kite on his own adrenaline. \nPENELOPE (aghast, chokingly) Get out of here. \nWOODLY It's really that bad? \nHe comes farther into the room, bravely. \nPENELOPE You fool, you fool. \nWOODLY Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you? \nHAROLD It died for your sins. \nWOODLY This little corpse is intended as a lesson? \nHAROLD There's a certain amount of information there. \nWOODLY Lest we forget how cruel you are. \nPENELOPE (moving to the telephone) I'm going to call the police. \nHAROLD (frighteningly) Don't! \n"}

BETSY Uncle Bill, you're going to miss your train! 
MURIEL Jim, you clean up this mess. I'll drive Bill to the station and pick up some cold cuts for dinner. 
Betsy and Joan pick up some boxes and walk into the dining room. 
BETSY You'd better hurry! 
BILL (indicating upstairs closet) Kind of hate to leave that little place. Just four walls and a couple of mothballs, but to me it'll always be home. 
JIM (preoccupied with timetable) So long, Bill. 
Bill and Muriel exit. 
INT. THE DINING ROOM 
As Jim drifts in, still preoccupied with timetable: 
JOAN It's certainly going to be fun this summer when Uncle Bill comes up for his vacation. 
BETSY We'll get in a lot of doubles. 
JIM Hmm? (looks up from timetable) What are you talking about? Bill's going to Europe. 
BETSY No, he's not. I heard him and mother talking. He's going to move his vacation up and take a place in Lansdale. 
JIM (vaguely annoyed) Uh-huh... Mm-hm. Mm-hm... Uh-huh. (then, covering up) All right, come on, come on. Get busy. 
DISSOLVE 
INT. THE BLANDINGS' CAR - (PROCESS) 
Evening is beginning to fall as Muriel drives Bill into town. 
MURIEL I'll scout around and find you a place in Lansdale. (quickly) Now, you're not going to change your mind about coming up? 
BILL Don't worry, I'll be on the job. 
MURIEL It won't be easy. I promise you a Cook's tour of every lamp maker, rug weaver, and antique shop in Lansdale County. 
BILL (philosophically) When I married you two I suppose I took you for better or for worse. 
Muriel smiles warmly, and in a friendly gesture reaches over and pats his hand. 
MURIEL Good old Uncle Bill. 
BILL (drily) Good old Uncle Bill. 
As they exchange an understanding smile: 
DISSOLVE 
INT. THE BLANDINGS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
It is dark outside and getting quite chilly. The children are unpacking a last barrel. They have made a rather unsteady pile of books and boxes, obviously Muriel's personal effects. Jim is in the process of trying to start his first fire in the fireplace. The immediate result is a clouding of the room with smoke. As he backs away, coughing, he bumps into the pile which falls to the floor spilling open a box which contains, among other things, Muriel's diary and a lifetime accumulation of sentimental trinkets. 
JIM Now look what you've done! 
Betsy coughs her way to the fireplace, turns the flue handle. The smoke immediately goes up the chimney and the room starts to clear. 
BETSY Father, the first principle of lighting a fire is to see if the flue is open. A three-year-old child knows that. 
JIM Next time we want a fire I'll send out for a three-year-old child! (indicates trinkets) Get that stuff cleaned up and go in and help Gussie set the table. It's getting late. 
The children start gathering up the debris. Joan picks up some trinkets which have spilled from a cardboard box. 
JOAN Look, Dad, your fraternity pins. 
JIM (busy cleaning the fireplace) Pins? I only had one. 
JOAN There are two of them here. 
JIM All right, all right. Just put them away. 
JOAN (examining them) Funny, this one says W.C. on the back. W.C.? (brightly) William Cole! It must be Uncle Bill's! 
JIM Huh? (reaching for it) Let me see that. (examining pin) Hmmmm. 
Betsy has picked up a small leather-bound book. She whistles. 
JOAN What's that? 
BETSY Mother's diary when she was in college. It's slightly torrid. 
JOAN (coming over) Let's see. 
JIM (sharply) That's none of your business!

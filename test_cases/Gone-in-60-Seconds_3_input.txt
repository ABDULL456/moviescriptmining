As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART IV: DREAMS OF YOU 
EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS - DAWN 
The sun just starting to take all the purple from the night ... 
Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff are parked across from the towers in their unmarked... 
Sway pulls up a few blocks away ... Memphis has put on a fake moustache, wig, necktie ... 
SWAY You okay -- ? 
MEMPHIS Yeah ... You -- ? 
She nods ... He looks at her ... 
MEMPHIS (cont'd) You should know: walking away from my mother, my brother, this town. Was hard. Walking away from you. Nearly killed me... 
And she smiles sadly ... 
SWAY I know ... 
She takes his hand ... Squeezes it ... 
SWAY (cont'd) Good luck... 
Memphis, now in gray flannel suit, wig and moustache, steps out. As he heads for the Tower garage... 
IN THE UNMARKED 
Drycoff is on the radio ... Binoculars up, on the Escort's license plate - 635 CKG ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF (into radio) One-Baker-11 ... 10-28-29...California 6-3-5 Charles King George. 
They wait ... Sway drives off ...

EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS - DAY 
Castlebeck and Drycoff ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF Check it out -- 
He points ... The '67 Mustang appears at the top of the garage ramp ... Brakes ... Waiting for the light ... Castlebeck squints... Raises the binocs ... Tough to tell.. Memphis drifts into the stream of traffic ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF (cont'd) What do you think -- ? 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Let's see what he's about -- 
Drycoff hits the lights and sirens ... Memphis sees the car behind him... 
MEMPHIS Shit ... 
And kicks it into gear... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF Hey, now -- ! 
He pins it ... And THE RACE IS ON... In the biggest way possible. This is the grand-daddy of chase scenes here, so we won't take the easy way out. We'll actually script it ... Memphis races out onto the busy street, Drycoff on his ass. 
Drycoff pulls up alongside him... So they can see him. But the wig and moustache prevent them from recognizing Memphis ... Other cars suffer from the pursuit ... They go careening into parked cars, storefronts, Harvard Square ... 
Memphis side-swipes Drycoff's car ... Memphis drives down the Memorial Drive OFF-RAMP, against traffic 
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK 1 Baker 11, in pursuit following collision with suspect. Suspect is male, white, 40-45, six feet, 175 pounds, gray hair, gray moustache, dark suit ... T.A.'s have occurred... 
Memphis races her down an alleyway... And we HEAR, as we will throughout, the VOICE of the 
POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.) Switch to open channel 3. All units stand-by. 
POLICE DISPATCH (cont'd) 1 Baker 11 in pursuit of a '67 Ford Mustang, license in the 6th column - 614 HSO. Repeat:  6-1-4 Harry Sam Ocean. Westbound on Memorial Drive, against traffic ... 
Eleanor races past The Queen Mary ... crossing the bridge into Long Beach ... She flies down the street ... Memphis, removing his wig and moustache as he goes... Another POLICE CAR has joined Drycoff and Castlebeck... 
INT. KISS-108 RADIO STATION - DAY 
The jocular drive-time jock MATTY IN THE MORNING - is broadcasting in his studio ... 
MATTY IN THE MORNING We're getting reports that a big police chase has started right near our humble studios ... We'll keep you posted... 
EXT. ELEANOR - MOVING - MEMPHIS 
Has the radio on ... Hears Matty ... He serpentines his way through the tangle of alleys...

Drycoff does his best to follow. Another CRUISER has joined up. Memphis is driving like Richard Petty... 
INT. LONG BEACH POLICE STATION - DAY 
Two dozen COPS sit in the muster room listening to the dispatch. 
POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.) ... Suspect is headed southbound on Mount Vernon, at Cambridge Street -- 
The cops look at each other. Holy shit! And race for the exit. Because Mt. Vernon and Cambridge is the address of THE LONG BEACH POLICE STATION 
where there are literally 15 POLICE CARS parked out front... And Memphis has just arrived... 
MEMPHIS Shit ... 
Watch the mad scramble as COPS dive into their units... And try to get out of each other's way... Fenders crunch ... Cops curse. Memphis bootlegs - going reverse down the wrong way. Left on Cambridge ... Left onto City Hall Plaza --

--and Klaus freezes there, stunned to see blood spattered on the floor and the screen door hanging off its hinges... 
KLAUS Oh my God. 
PAUL ON BLEACHERS 
...as Paul absently takes another bite of his sandwich, not really tasting it, keeps reading... 
INT. DETTERICK HOUSE - DAWN (FLASHBACK) 
...plunging us back into the screaming chaos: Klaus grabbing up shotgun shells, Howie loading the .22 rifle he got for Christmas, Marjorie sobbing incoherently... 
KLAUS GODDAMN IT, WOMAN, GET ON THE PHONE NOW! YOU TELL 'EM WE HEADED WEST! MIND WHAT I'M SAYING! WEST, Y'HEAR? 
...and she goes stumbling through the house, grabbing for the phone as her men disappear toward the porch b.g.: 
MARJORIE Central! Central, are you on the line? Oh, God, please, somebody took my little girls... 
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE 
Klaus and his son race from the house, following spatters of blood across the yard... 
PAUL ON THE BLEACHERS 
...as Paul lets out a long breath, turns the page... 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
---and we see CARS AND TRUCKS pulling up, MEN jumping out with rifles, pouring down the incline toward the field where Klaus is hollering and waving his arms. Deputy McGee comes sliding down from the road, taking charge at the top of his lungs-- 
McGEE I WANT ALL THE WEAPONS UNLOADED, Y'HEAR? TAKE OUT YOUR SHELLS, I WON'T HAVE A MAN SHOT BY ACCIDENT TODAY! BOBO, WHERE THEM DOGS? 
--and the dogs come bounding out of the back of a truck, howling down the incline to lead the chase... 
VARIOUS ANGLES 
...which takes us through the cattails and bulrushes...to the spot where Klaus finds the little scrap of pale yellow fabric, turns and screams... 
KLAUS Oh, Lord, this belongs to my Katie... 
...and they keep going, stopping abruptly as they find: A blood-drenched area of tramped grass. A little girl's bloody nightgown hangs in the low branches of a tree. Some of these strong men look like they might throw up or faint at the sight of it. Their blood freezes in their veins as an INHUMAN HOWLING commences up ahead. It's like nothing they've ever heard before, raising the hackles of men and dogs alike. 
PAUL ON BLEACHERS 
...as Paul quietly turns another page, shaking his head... 
PAUL Jesus. 
EXT. FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
The men reload their weapons. Everybody's terrified. McGee starts off, the other following his lead toward-- 
THE RIVER 
--where they emerge from the treeline, drawing ever closer to the source of that INHUMAN HOWLING... 
...and they stop, gazing in horror: 
John Coffey sits on the riverbank in bloody overalls, his huge feet splayed out before him. He's making that inhuman howling sound, face twisted in monstrous grief, pausing occasionally to take in a great hitching breath of air. 
Curled in his massive arms are the naked bodies of Detterick's 9 year-old twin girls, their once-blonde hair now matted to their heads with blood. 
A tableau. The men staring. John Coffey howling. A train puffing smoke across the landscape. 
Klaus Detterick breaks the moment, lunging down the riverbank in a headlong rush. The others try to grab him, but he shrugs them off and throws himself on Coffey with a scream of inarticulate rage, kicking and punching, fists flying. Coffey barely seems to notice. 
The others catch up with Klaus, drag him off. He falls to his knees on the riverbank, sobbing into his hands. Howie runs to him, throws himself into his father's arm. They hug each other tightly, overwhelmed with grief. 
A semblance of quiet descends, except for Coffey's heartbroken wailing. A ring of rifle toting men forms around him, though he hardly seems aware of it. McGee steps forward, uncertain: 
McGEE Mister. 
Coffey goes quiet at once, eyes still streaming tears. 
McGEE Mister? Can you hear me? (Coffey nods) You have a name? 
COFFEY John Coffey. Like the drink, only not spelt the same. 
McGee hunkers carefully down, watching for any sudden moves. 
McGEE What happened here, John Coffey? You want to tell me that? 
COFFEY I couldn't help it. I tried to take it back, but it was too late. 
McGEE (pause) Boy, you are under arrest for murder. 
McGee spits in Coffey's face... 
PAUL ON BLEACHERS 
...as Paul looks up with a slight start, jarred from his reading to find WARDEN HAL MOORES standing before him. 
HAL I interrupt? 
PAUL I'm just about done. 
Paul stows the file as Hal settles onto the bleachers. 
PAUL How's that pretty gal of yours?

- THE ORANGUTAN RUNS THROUGH THE STAMPEDE DIRECTLY TO JACOB 
AND CLUTCHES ONTO JACOB'S LEG. JACOB MOVES TO PICK HER UP 
WHEN BOBO SWINGS FROM A ROPE AND JUMPS ONTO JACOB'S BACK. Jacob manages to hold Bobo in one arm and the Orangutan in the other as his eyes sweep the tent, searching for Marlena: Then Jacob sees - THE PANTHER MAKES IT'S WAY THROUGH THE 
CONNECTED WALKWAY TO THE BIG TOP AUDIENCE. 
- SECONDS LATER, AUDIENCE SCREAMS OF TERROR ARE HEARD. THE 
CROWD EXPLODES THROUGH THE BIG TOP, TRAMPLING OVER FELLOW 
AUDIENCE MEMBERS...THEY CHARGE INTO THE MENAGERIE ONLY TO 
FACE THE STAMPEDE.. 
- THE MASS OF ANIMALS CHANGE DIRECTIONS AND THERE IS AN INTER- 
SPECIES FLOCK; LIONS, LLAMAS AND ZEBRAS RUNNING SIDE BY SIDE 
WITH THE CHIMPS AND ORANGUTANS..A HYENA SHOULDER TO SHOULDER 
WITH A TIGER...TWELVE HORSES AND A GIRAFFE WITH A SPIDER 
MONKEY ON IT'S NECK...THE POLAR BEAR NOW ON ALL FOURS, 
CHARGING...ALL OF THEM HEADING FOR THE CROWD OF PEOPLE... 
- THE CROWD SHIFTS, RIOTING BACK INTO THE BIG TOP. CLOGGING 
THE ENTRANCE...PEOPLE BANGING ON THE BACKS OF THOSE IN FRONT 
OF THEM.. 
- THE CLOG BURSTS. PEOPLE AND ANIMALS FLEE IN EVERY 
DIRECTION... 
- A BENGAL TIGER FORCES ITSELF BETWEEN A WOMAN'S LEGS, 
SWEEPING HER TO THE GROUND... Searching and dodging animals, Jacob sees a flash of pink sequins. He sees August with Marlena standing beside him, in front of Rosie. 
JACOB 
MARLENA! Marlena sees Jacob and makes a run for him, but August quickly grabs her arm and flings her to the ground. She falls out of view from Jacob. Jacob runs to them, dodging the fleeing animals, when suddenly: A BULL HOOK FLIES FROM OUT OF THE AIR ACROSS THE ANIMALS AND PIERCES JACOB'S SHOULDER. He cries out. Rosie cries out. She begins to stamp her feet. Marlena lies with her face in the dirt, crawling beneath the ropes to get under Rosie for safety. 
August pulls Jacob with a new bull hook, tossing him the ground. August glares at him, his eyes full of rage; 
AUGUST 
YOU! YOU DID THIS!! He attacks but Jacob dodges the next blow, grabbing onto the bull hook and twisting it with such strength, it topples August who refuses to let it go... JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT SAVAGELY, AMIDST THE STAMPEDE. Like madmen fighting with the intention to kill. Jacob unleashes a rage and a strength we have yet to see in him, as he beats August without mercy... But August manages to overpower Jacob, unleashing his own maniacal fury. By taking advantage of the bull hook wound, August gets Jacob into a death grip around his neck. Marlena screams out, unable to help as animals stampede around the two men locked in combat. Only Rosie, who towers above them, knows what to do. Jacob, choking under August's grip, looks up at Rosie. She raises her trunk to smile at him. Jacob looks down and sees that ROSIE'S STAKE HAS BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE GROUND. Jacob fights August to breathe as Rosie reveals she is holding the stake loosely, resting it's end on the dirt. The chain still attached to her foot. Jacob flips himself which forces August to turn his back on Rosie in order to keep his grip on Jacob. Marlena covers her head in her arms, not wanting to see. Jacob can not breathe..August is squeezing the life from him 
AS: Rosie lifts the stake as if it weighs nothing and brings it down onto August, splitting his head in one clean move. She continues to hold the stake until August topples forward, dead, his skull opened like a hardboiled egg.. Released of August, Jacob rolls himself under the ropes just 
BEFORE: 
A HERD OF ZEBRAS RUN PAST, CRUSHING AUGUST BENEATH THEM. 
Rosie then slides the stake back to the ground. Marlena, head hidden under her arms, sees nothing. The menagerie is clear of the stampeding animals. Marlena lifts her head up from beneath her arms, remaining under Rosie. She sees August lifeless body. She looks to Jacob. He rises, bloodied and beaten, but alive. WIDE ANGLE: The empty menagerie except for: Jacob standing, Marlena under Rosie and the two monkeys inspecting August's dead body.

She has been well trained. 
But she makes no impact on HENRY. He waves the SEYMOURS away. Not remotely interested. 
or the moment. 
INT. MARY'S ROOM - LYING-IN - EVENING The KING is visiting MARY. He sits by her bed. They hold hands and are talking intimately. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
This is being watched by the DUKE of NORFOLK, and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN. NORFOLK's face is dark and brooding.. 
NORFOLK For the moment he's still visiting Mary. But for how long? The Queen will soon have his head spinning with pretty little Spanish things. Not to mention the Seymours with that girl of theirs. 
NORFOLK looks up... 
NORFOLK What we need is someone from OUR family who will keep the King focused on Mary, reminding him of her while she is absent. 
SIR THOMAS is about to speak, then changes his mind. 
NORFOLK What? Speak.. 
SIR THOMAS It's just...I was going to suggest Anne. 
NORFOLK You couldn't control that girl last time. What makes you think it would be any different now? 
SIR THOMAS I've had favourable reports from the Dowager Queen in France. It seems she is quite changed. 
INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY MARY sits up. Her eyes widen in horror..

MARY Why? 
Sitting beside her in the darkness, is her brother GEORGE.. 
GEORGE I suppose they felt three years of exile was punishment enough. 
MARY But the King visits me every day. There's no need for her. Or anyone else. 
GEORGE They just want to protect you. Leave nothing to chance. 
MARY But in who's interests do they imagine Anne will act? Certainly not mine. 
GEORGE turns, looks all around him.. 
GEORGE (cont'd) Why DO they make this room such a dungeon? Does it really need to be this dark? 
GEORGE notices MARY's vexed expression.. 
GEORGE Don't worry. She's had three years to forgive you. And she's not going to risk being sent away again. She'll do as she's told, I'm sure. (a beat) Besides, the most important thing is.. 
GEORGE moves MARY's lips into an upward shape.. 
GEORGE The three of us will be together again. 
MARY's lips: a reluctant, unconvincing smile.. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
EXT. KENT COUNTRYSIDE - COAST - DAY The thunder of galloping horses. 
alf a dozen RIDERS, among them a HOODED WOMAN, riding side- saddle, tearing across the countryside.. 
P 
EXT. VILLAGES - DAY The RIDERS and the WOMAN gallop through villages, spraying mud. VILLAGERS stop and stare.. 
A MOTHER pulls a child out of the path of the RIDERS. 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT The RIDERS and the WOMAN ride in silhouette against a perfect full moon.. 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY HENRY and several of his COURTIERS return from a hunting trip. Several dead STAGS are carried on horseback. The atmosphere is celebratory. It's been a good day. 
Dogs bark in excitement. 
INT. GREENWICH PALACE - THAT NIGHT A dinner at court. HENRY is at one end, in serious conversation with foreign AMBASSADORS. Presently, at the other end of the table, loud laughter. H ENRY looks up, then returns to his conversation. 
It's not long before another loud gale of laughter in the corner of the room. HENRY looks up again. Then returns to his conversation. 
resently, a third roar of laughter at the other end. This time, HENRY loses patience.. 
HENRY What's the noise? I can hardly hear myself think! 
At the other end, a COURTIER gets to his feet.. 
BRANDON It's Mistress Boleyn, your Majesty. Her stories about life at the French court. They are particularly amusing. 
HENRY's expression changes. The room falls silent.. 
HENRY I'm only aware of one Boleyn girl and she is lying-in with a certain child in her belly!

RETURN ANGLE 
She shrinks back from them with a frightened, apologetic smile. Scrambled eggs bubble in the skillet on the burner. 
MUFFY I... I was hungry... 
She bumps against the stove, backing away. She self-consciously runs a hand through her hair. 
MUFFY (cont.) I... I must look a mess... 
She scuttles out the door to the utility room and the back stairs beyond, leaving the eggs to burn. 
INT. BACK STAIRS Â­ DAY 
Arch encounters her, too, as he comes bounding down in his workout shorts. 
ARCH Morning! She backs away from him, scurrying up the stairs. 
MUFFY I... forgot to get dressed... 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Arch enters, joining his wonderment to Rob and Kit's. ARCH Who made her night? 
EXT. BACK PORCH - DAY - LATER 
CUT TO: 
Arch, Chaz, Harvey and Nikki burst out the door in old clothes, sweats, shorts, whatever -- an unlikely foursome for some informal soccer scrimmaging. 
ARCH (always in search of more players) Where's Skip? 
CHAZ That depends on what he's on. 
Rob and Kit cross their path, heading down to the water in their swimsuits and overshirts. 
NIKKI You gotta be kidding... 
ARCH (teasingly, an invitation) Nan? What about it? 
Nan watches from the porch, book in hand. 
NAN Oh, no, thanks. (FALSELY) Besides, I thought I'd wait and see what Muffy wanted to do... 
Arch shrugs and the soccer free-for-all begins in earnest, with special attention given to the interplay between Harvey and Nikki. 
Up on the porch, Nan finally sees Muffy emerging from the distant tool shed. Muffy is dressed plainly, oddly conventional, with a perceptible sense of disorder about her. She keeps to herself, turning toward the woods beyond, with cutting blade and mushroom basket in hand. 
Nan puts down her book, hurrying off the porch. But by the timeshe looks up again, Muffy is gone... EXT. DOCK - DAY 
Rob and Kit are standing together on the dock. He is dripping wet and covered with goose flesh. She has not been in yet. And while he is vigorously toweling off his arms and chest, trying to get the blood circulating again, she stands behind him with another towel and gently, lovingly dries his back. She finishes and he steps away from her and gazes out across the sound. 
KIT Rob? What's wrong? 
Pause. 
ROB I swear it wasn't this cold yesterday . 
This isn't what she meant, and he knows it. 
KIT Are you giving up? 
ROB (turning to her; gently) What about you? What about your future? You're the one with the four point. (DEJECTED) ...maybe it's crazy--you investing so much energy in me. 
KIT (QUIETLY) I don't know. I'm scared. I don't know if I want what Mom and everybody else expects of me. I don't want to go to law school. 
ROB (PROTESTING) You've got a great mind 
KIT ...only it's not made up. 
Smiling sadly, he crosses to her, puts his arms around her. 
ROB Great... Do you realize how perfectly unmatched we are? 
KIT It's made up about one thing though. 
ROB Yeah? What's that? She looks up and kisses him softly. 
ROB Will you feel the same about me a year from now? Two years, five years from now?

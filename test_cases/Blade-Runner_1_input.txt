Hesitates. 
DECKARD Yes? 
ESPER Do you have something against science? 
DECKARD Not if it works. 
ESPER And what in your estimation works? 
DECKARD The umbrella. 
Deckard picks up the umbrella and with it stabs the terminal off button before Esper can respond and the machine goes dead.  He sits there for a moment then flips on the lamp.  Leon's snap-shots are spread out before him. 
INT. SPINNER - DAY                                      30 
A police marked spinner makes a sharp bank, drops into a steep curve and slides towards the Tyrell Corporation. 
DECKARD (V.O.) Every government that could was racing to populate their colonial territory.  But emigrants needed incentive.  Over-population and the greenhouse factor didn't seem to be enough; but owning a human look-a-like had lots of appeal. It was big industry, the competition was stiff and Tyrell was top of the line. 
EXT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           31 
The spinner gently touches down.  The hatch drops open and Deckard steps out. 
DECKARD (V.O.) His claim to fame was making a product more human than human and sometimes the 'more' turned out to be a problem.  This wasn't just an escaped andy who broke his owner's arm -- there were twenty-eight people dead and the pressure was on. 
INT. TYRELL CORPORATION - DAY                           32 
Deckard walks up to a desk, hands his I.D. to a guard who checks it against a list on a screen. 
DECKARD (V.O.) But so far they'd always managed to keep it quiet.  Not to say that once in a while there wasn't bad publicity.  Some fanatic bitching about equal rights for andies or an occasional trade union proclaiming it was aun-American for automatons to take jobs away from humans on the colony. 
The guard hands Deckard back his I.D., pushed a button and Deckard walks away. 
DECKARD (V.O.) But what's more American than good old supply and demand?  The Government needed them, industry made them and the church backed them.  The big religious boys said that Androids, no matter how human, were objects; only God could make people. I'm not religious, but I was inclined to agree. Otherwise I'd be out of a job. 
The elevator door slides open.  The young lady inside would look right standing on a cliff, hair blowing in the wind, looking out to sea in a 19th Century painting. 
RACHAEL Hello, Mr. Deckard.  My name is Rachael. 
Deckard tips his head to her and steps in. 
INT. TYRELL CORPORATION ELEVATOR - DAY                  33 
No woman can be all things to all men, the Rachael comes closer than most.  The only trouble is she's all busi- ness.  Formidable without really trying.  Some beauty is better avoided and Deckard looks straight ahead. 
INT. TYRELL CORPORATION CORRIDOR - DAY                  33A 
The door slides open and they continue down the corri- dor. 
RACHAEL It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit. 
DECKARD A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem. 
RACHAEL But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard? 
INT. TYRELL CORPORATION - AIR-FILTERED CORRIDOR - DAY   33B 
They pass into a canopied, air-filtered corridor. Deckard doesn't answer the question because he's looking at the animals.  Small northern animals in neat "en- vironmental" cages.  He looks at the rabbit, the raccoon and the squirrel, but the owl asleep on its perch stops him.  The armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes off them. 
RACHAEL You like our owl? 
Deckard nods.  Rachael claps her hands.  The owl opens its yellow eyes and blinks at them. 
DECKARD It's artificial? 
RACHAEL Of course not. 
Hands thrust in her pockets, she strides off towards the exit without looking back. 
The exit is another tube.  Just big enough for two.  No room for excess.  He tries to ignore her cool appraising stare. 
RACHAEL You're in a very unique position, Mr. Deckard.  You could affect the future of this entire organization according to how you work your little test. 
Deckard has nothing to say. 
RACHAEL Are you apprehensive?

The car stops in front of the check-in desk. \nMachete steps out. The dust clears. \nMore ARMED MEN stream from the office. \nMACHETE sideswipes the first THUG with his MACHETE, swinging him around to face the fire of the others. \nTHUG ragdolls around like a marionette long enough for Machete to slash one of the men's wrists, sending his aim wild and taking out the others. \nINT.

Check it out. (Holds up X-Rays) This is amazing. You can see the bullet rebounded, entered the back of the cranium and was stopped by another bullet already lodged in the bone.

There's a lesson in there somewhere... \nA GRUFF SECURITY GUARD walks in and HANDCUFFS Machete to the side of the gurney. \nSECURITY GUARD You're going to tell me who you're working for or I'll bury your spic ass and have your wife turning tricks for tacos by breakfast.

RNewman / Endeavor Draft 33. \nELEKTRA Is the shooter known to you, I mean, did you have any warnings or communication before today? \nMCLAUGHLIN No. \nELEKTRA looks over at Benz, gets nothing. \nELEKTRA My expertise is in profiling and assessing risks of potentially dangerous individuals who are in this country illegally. \nBENZ Looks like you missed one. \nBurn. Then, not missing a beat-- \nELEKTRA Would you like additional DHS officers assigned to your security detail? \nBENZ The senator is trying to project an image of resilience, not fear.

Or you think of anything else. \nShe hands Benz her card. \nBENZ You'll be the first person I call. \nElektra leaves and Benz drops the card in the trash. \nMachete pulls her down onto him.

Your father taught it to me, too! \nTorrez ATTACKS Machete \nThe two FIGHT with sword and machete. \nElektra rolls on the ground, dodging Torrez's rain of blows from the samurai swords. \nOne sweep slices her bindings and she scrambles to safety. \nThe distraction is enough for Machete to gain the upper hand and slash Torrez across the front. \nOn the edge of death Torrez seems to soften. \n", "test1_input": "EXT.

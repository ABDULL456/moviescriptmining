Do not attempt to take the safehouse alone! Officer Cruz! You hear me!? \nOFFICER ERHMAN Torrez sounds mad. You going to answer him? \nMachete glares.

You heard the boss. \nMachete pulls his Machete, sticks it up to Erhman's face. \nMACHETE This is the boss. \nEhrman crosses himself. \nA phalanx of ARMED GUARDS emerge from the dead cars.

MEXICAN HOTEL, LOBBY \nThe Uzi's out of ammo. The girl frowns and drops it. \nThe fucked-up patrolcar blocks the way out, for now. Machete resheathes his weapon into a slit in his pants. \nGirl arches her back, her crotch in Machete's face, then slides down his front, her breasts brushing his eyes, nose, mouth. \nMACHETE We need to go. Now. \nCHICA In what? That? \nThe patrolcar isn't going anywhere. \nShe rips open his shirt and rubs his tattoo.

Her KNIFE ROLL unfurls, she grabs two knives as GOON TWO leaps at her. \nIn a BLUR she slices off his EARS like she's chopping onions. \nPancho runs in and gobbles them up. \nSNIPER and his henchmen open fire with their MACHINE GUNS. Luz dives back into the taco truck. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 63. \nINT. TACO TRUCK \nLuz ducks and runs through the truck, as bullets blast apart everything. She grabs a gun and shoots back through the windows. \nShrapnel sprays her face, a huge SLIVER of GLASS SINKS into her eye. \nShe yanks it out and shoots back. \nLUZ Hijo de Puta! \nLuz is shot in the chest, she flies back blood spewing out. \nShe sees the men reloading through the window. \nLuz is bleeding, one eye gouged out, fading fast. \nLUZ (CONT'D) You're coming with me Maricons! \nIt's the room where June and April were. \nIt's empty. The nuns' robes are on the floor. \nINT. CHURCH. \nSniper and a few of the henchmen hold a battered Padre down on the ground. \nSNIPER Where is he? \nPADRE In your nightmares. \nSniper looks to Booth, who nods. \nSniper hammers a nail into Padre's hand. Padre grits his teeth against the pain. \nPADRE (CONT'D) (TO BOOTH) You're afraid to get your hands dirty, so you make others carry out your sins. \nSniper raises the hammer again, but Booth stills his hand, takes the hammer. \nBooth leans over Padre's other hand. \nBENZ You want to be a martyr? I'm good at making martyrs. \nBooth raises the hammer. \nPADRE Like McLaughlin? RNewman / Endeavor Draft 66. \nBENZ That's right. In our own way, we can all be like Christ. Too bad for you, you chose the worst way. \nHe slams another nail into Padre's other hand. \nPADRE You're so drunk with power, you ordered the hit on your own boss. \nBENZ This is the boss. \nBooth hammers the nails in one by one. Bloody Padre screams. \nBENZ (CONT'D) Now for the last time... where are my wife and daughter? \nPadre, beaten and bloody, laughs. \nBenz puts two in his chest. Padre expires. \nEXT. ONION FIELDS - DAY \nA produce truck filled with migrant workers stops on the roadside near an onion field. Workers spill out of the back and get to work. \nThe last two out are April and June. \nThey look up and down the road.

Focused on Padre's lifeless crucified body. \nFLASH CUT FLASHBACK \nYOUNG MACHETE dropping the sugarcane sword and picking up the MACHETE... \nMachete takes a drink off the Tequila bottle. \nMACHETE Si. \nELEKTRA Give me that bottle. \nHe hands it to her. She swigs. \nELEKTRA (CONT'D) So what happens now, when you get him, that's it? It's over? \nElektra hears a noise in the back of the house. \nELEKTRA (CONT'D) Did you hear that?

The bed frame CRACKS \nMachete sees a SHADOW of a man through the window curtain and another... \nHe tries to push her off him. \nShe WON'T let him! She's an animal, screeches and yells in SPANISH. \nMachete grabs the gun off the night table, just as the HIT SQUAD gets there. \nHe manages to keep Elektra happy as he BLASTS the MASKED HITMEN coming in. \nThey crash through the windows and doors as he finishes everyone off at once. \nElektra lets out a final scream and collapses on him. \nELEKTRA Wow that was... \nShe notices the carnage. \nELEKTRA (CONT'D) Oh my god...did I wake the neighbors? \nThey get up. She pulls the ski mask off a dead gunman. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 71. \nELEKTRA (CONT'D) This is one of ours. He works for the agency. \nMACHETE Come on! \nMachete's army of workers stream out from their road warrior chop shop rides. \nMachete dismounts. His army behind him. \nHe raises his MACHETE against the sun and his army all raise theirs. \nBig battle sequence as they storm the armory. Knives and guns... a ballet of bullets and blood. \nLUZ arrives in one of the HOT RODS from the chop shop. She has a MACHETE GUN that shoots out Machete blades like a Machine gun. \nA minuteman grabs her from behind, but.. \nHe is STABBED in the CALF by Pancho! A METAL HARNESS onhis back holds a sharp KNIFE that he stabs with. \nThe minuteman falls, Pancho stabs him in the face. \nLuz leads a gang of her customers into the battle. \nMinutemen and Mexicanos of all walks of life--janitors, gardeners, laborers, gangbangers, etc.--fight it out at the armory. Fighting it out with the implements of their trade-- knives hidden in mops, a weedwhacker attack, etc. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 82. \nA wailing AMBULANCE CRASHES through a gate running down minutemen. DOC FELIX and his sexy NURSE get out and help a wounded Mexican. Doc flicks a SCALPEL at an approaching Goon. \nMachete unveils a Gatling Gun with a special mount that affixes to the front of the chopper. \nBooth scrambles to arm himself, but he's cornered. He tries to take cover behind thugs, but-- \nMachete on the motorcycle with the Gatling Gun mows down Booth, machine gunning him in half. \nBooth looks down at his own white shirt, now stained crimson and ripped to shreds as he falls to the ground in TWO PIECES. \nWhile the battle between chopshoppers and militia rages on-- \nTORREZ appears with ELEKTRA-- \nTORREZ Machete! \nMachete stops, turns to see Elektra, bound and gagged in Torrez's control. \nTORREZ (CONT'D) You never learned to stay down, pendejo. I killed you once. I can do it again. \nINT. WAREHOUSE \nMachete skids into the warehouse. Fuel barrels line a far wall. \nTorrez is ready for him. \nTORREZ All roads lead to Hell, eh, Machete? \nMachete squints. Flashes back to the earlier scene. The two images blur into one. \nTORREZ (CONT'D) Most people die in the fire, but you survived, you unlucky bastard. \nMACHETE I was born in the fire. It wasn't luck. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 83. \nTORREZ Faith? Yeah, faith got you a good job picking melons. While I bought the world. \nMACHETE What good is it... \nTORREZ. .. for a man to gain the whole world yet forfeit his soul? Mark 8:36. I know it better than you Machete. Your father taught it to me, too! \nTorrez ATTACKS Machete \nThe two FIGHT with sword and machete. \nElektra rolls on the ground, dodging Torrez's rain of blows from the samurai swords. \nOne sweep slices her bindings and she scrambles to safety. \nThe distraction is enough for Machete to gain the upper hand and slash Torrez across the front. \nOn the edge of death Torrez seems to soften. \n", "test1_input": "He CRASHES through the windshield into their laps. \nThe car drives through the front window of a coffee shop. \nINT.

Mclaughlin is making a statement on the phone. \nBenz gives her a hard look, waves her away to wait. \nMCLAUGHLIN (ON PHONE) This act... this cowardly act...

God bless everyone who stood with me today, I will return to the fight. And God Bless America. \nBenz takes the phone from him. \nBENZ No further statements. We only hope that the perpetrator is brought to swift justice in an American court. \nElektra flashes a badge at McLaughlin. Benz hangs up. \nELEKTRA Elektra Rivers, Department of Homeland Security. \nBENZ This is a state matter. We've already talked to-- \nELEKTRA DHS has jurisdiction over everyone so give it a rest, Mr-- \nBENZ Booth. Michael Booth. \nMCLAUGHLIN I don't know what I can do to help you in here, Agent Rivers. You want to find the bastard did this, go look for him. \nELEKTRA I appreciate that, sir, and I ASSURE YOU-- \nMcLaughlin spits on her shoe. \nMCLAUGHLIN You can't assure dick. Just ask what you want and then you can be on your way. \nShe keeps her steely resolve as she pulls out a small note pad. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 33. \nELEKTRA Is the shooter known to you, I mean, did you have any warnings or communication before today? \nMCLAUGHLIN No. \nELEKTRA looks over at Benz, gets nothing. \nELEKTRA My expertise is in profiling and assessing risks of potentially dangerous individuals who are in this country illegally. \nBENZ Looks like you missed one. \nBurn. Then, not missing a beat-- \nELEKTRA Would you like additional DHS officers assigned to your security detail? \nBENZ The senator is trying to project an image of resilience, not fear. Now I'm sure you'll agree, the Senator has had a very trying day. \nELEKTRA Here's my card, in case you change your mind. Or you think of anything else. \nShe hands Benz her card. \nBENZ You'll be the first person I call. \nElektra leaves and Benz drops the card in the trash. \n", "test1_true": "Machete runs down alleys, slowing, tired. \nLUZ'S TACO TRUCK sits at the end of the alley.

Did you see those crews out there? They expect a statement. (noticing Booth's ragged APPEARANCE) Jesus, what happened to you? \nBENZ Nothing. Just had a little talk with a priest. \nMCLAUGHLIN Well, what am I going to tell `em? \nBENZ Whatever you tell them, I'm sure it'll be golden.

All right. Once this is done, you need to take a vacation. You need some air. \nBENZ Maybe. \nMCLAUGHLIN No doubt about it.

HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Everybody looses the thing that made them, it's even how it's supposed to be in nature. 
EXT. LAVA RIDGE - DAY 
Now with her three friends, she tip-toes past several humongous footprints up to a gruesome fox carcass. Something gigantic has ripped open its stomach and gutted it. 
She leans over, unafraid, trying to understand it's meaning. Flies swarm and nibble, their movement almost elegant. Seen in close up, the gory mess has a strange beauty to it. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The brave men stay and watch it happen. They don't run. 
A SONIC BOOM springs her upright, she looks around for the source of the sound. Is it an Aurochs? 
She looks towards the muddy bayou. The SONIC BOOM sounds again and the entire body of water quivers with the impact. 
EXT. DARDAR RIDGE - EVENING 
The beacon blinks out on the water. 
Hushpuppy stares towards it. The children are gathered behind her. 
Something has changed in her eyes. The eerie calm has given way to a hardened determination. Though unclear to us, her internal path of action is certain. 
She takes a deep breath, and lets out a WARRIOR CRY. She runs straight into the water with her girl gang charging behind her. 
EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - EVENING 
Joy, Tee-Lou, Lizard, and Hushpuppy swim through open water, pulling each other forward. They head in the direction of the beacon. 
HUSHPUPPY Come on! Keep going! 
They try to kick toward the light but are getting nowhere, the current pulls them backwards. 
We hear a BOAT HORN and they look to where an ANCIENT TUG BOAT with a cabin that towers into the sky like a giraffe head, appears through the mist. 
EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - SERGEANT MAJOR'S BOAT - EVENING 
The girls climb aboard, lifting each other onto the deck. 
They look up to the sound of FOOTSTEPS on the upper deck. 
Hushpuppy looks up to see SERGEANT MAJOR (60) - 
A big, timeless looking man with a salt and pepper moustache, saunters up to the rail. He stares down, examining these runts with an air of suspicion. 
HUSHPUPPY I'm going by my Mamma. 
He smiles broadly, as if this was the secret password. Him and Hushpuppy stare at each other and immediately there is understanding. Two lost souls in the wilderness. 
SERGEANT MAJOR That's a good place to go. 
EXT. GULF OF MEXICO - SERGEANT MAJOR'S BOAT - EVENING 
Hushpuppy sits adjacent to the Sergeant in the tug's elevated wheelhouse. They are two stories up, and the white walls create a glow that makes us feel like we're almost in another dimension. 
HUSHPUPPY Which way are we going?

You're worried we're going to 
be all right.  We're going to 
be all right. 
(Sam gives Jonah a 
squeeze) 
I remember sometimes you'd have 
nightmares as a baby.  Your mom 
would hold you and rock you and 
sing you a song. 
JONAH 
Bye bye blackbird. 
SAM 
Is that what she used to sing? 
JONAH 
I miss her. 
(beat) 
What do you think happens to 
someone after they die? 
SAM 
I don't know. 
JONAH 
Like do you believe in heaven? 
SAM 
I never did.  Or the whole idea 
of an afterlife.  But I don't 
know any more.  I have these 
dreams about... your mom... and 
we have long talks about... 
about you, and how you are, 
which she sort of knows but I 
tell her anyway.  So what is 
that? It's sort of an afterlife, 
isn't it? 
JONAH 
I'm starting to forget her. 
SAM 
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. 
Because I have you.  And as 
long as I have you, I have your 
Mom. 
Hold on the two of them as music begins.  Bye Bye 
Blackbird. 
SAM 
I... uh... have a date with 
someone Friday night. 
JONAH 
Good. 
A beat. 
SAM 
Did I ever tell you about the 
time I ate a dog biscuit? 
As Jonah cuddles closer MUSIC COMES UP AS WE PULL BACK 
FROM THE BED AND... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT 
AS MUSIC CONTINUES.  Annie waves as Becky gets into her 
car and rides away.  Annie turns to her doorway and 
stops.  She can't go back in.  She needs to walk and 
think.  She crosses the street into a little 
neighborhood park.  We can see the moon. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 
Sam comes out onto the porch.  Flops down in his deck 
chair.  The city lights in the background.  Same moon. 
The MUSIC CONTINUES. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARK - NIGHT 
Annie flops down on a child's swing set in the park. 
MUSIC CONTINUES. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON SAM 
CLOSE ON ANNIE 
AND A LONG SHOT OF ANNIE IN THE SWING 
As Walter pulls up into the parking space Becky pulled 
out of.  Annie starts toward him. 
A LONG SHOT OF SAM ON THE BACK OF THE BOAT 
Make my bed and light the lights I'll arrive late 
tonight, blackbird, bye bye. 
FADE IN: 
INT. BALTIMORE SUN - DAY 
Annie on the phone at her desk. 
ANNIE 
Laurie, it's Annie.  Fine, I'm 
fine.  Listen, I'm doing an 
article on call-in radio shows. 
Do you know anyone who works 
for someone named Dr. Marcia 
Fieldstone...? 
CUT TO: 
Annie on the phone. 
ANNIE 
I'm a writer for the Baltimore 
Sun and I'm a friend of Laurie 
Johnson's.  I'm doing a piece 
on how people handle 
bereavement and I understand 
that you had a caller the other 
night... I know you're not 
supposed to, but Laurie said 
you might, and I'll plug the 
show and everything -- 
(she winces in 
anticipation of a 
rejection, but then 
her face relaxes) 
CUT TO: 
Annie dialing Sam's telephone number. 
JONAH (ON MACHINE) 
This is Jonah Baldwin, we're 
not in right now but you can 
leave -- 
Annie hangs up. 
ANNIE 
Baldwin. 
CUT TO: 
Annie at her computer modem.  She's dialing a number.

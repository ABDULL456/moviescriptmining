SOPHIE No thanks. HANNA looks off to the tree line. In the distance she spots a couple of RABBITS in a pool of sunlight. 
122 INT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 122 
HANNA turns a display unit of postcards. Through the window she can see SOPHIE talking to TWO TEENAGE 
BOYS. One of the boys enters the shop. He looks at HANNA as he passes and smiles. This is FELICIANO. He is handsome. HANNA'S not used to this feeling of being looked at. While the SHOP ASSISTANT serves FELICIANO HANNA pockets a postcard and a book of stamps. 
123 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE. OFFICE/SHOP. 123 
HANNA sits on a low wall writing her postcard: âMission accomplished' HANNA gets up and posts the card. 
124 EXT. WOODS NEAR CAMPSITE - DAY 124 
RACHEL and HANNA are walking in the woods together. Above them the evening chorus is in full song. 
RACHEL I just feel connected when I'm in the countryside. The city stifles me... emotionally, creatively. HANNA'S attention is elsewhere, she's spotted something in the undergrowth. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) Anyway, I was very young when I... Seb and I.... He was so impressive. HANNA suddenly runs into the woods. 
RACHEL (CONT'D) Hanna?! 
125 EXT. SPANISH CAMPSITE - EVENING 125 
The FAMILY are sitting in fold-out chairs eating charred veggie sausages. 
SOPHIE It's probably just a bunch of Spanish farmers, mum. We're hardly going to be out all night. 
RACHEL You're not going, Sophie. No way, Jose. HANNA appears from the woods carrying TWO SKINNED RABBITS. She lays them in front of the family. 
HANNA Food. SOPHIE lets out a shriek of nervous laughter, while SEB and RACHEL are confused as to what the appropriate reaction might be. 
MILES That's gross. 
126 INT. CAMPSITE PUBLIC BATHROOM - NIGHT 126 
The girls are hiding out in the Ladies Room as SOPHIE does HANNA'S make-up. 
SOPHIE I don't know why I'm doing this, you're going to steal all the best men off of me. 
HANNA What do you mean? 
SOPHIE Though quite frankly I don't need more digits than I've got right now. Loads. Loads and loads. HANNA watches herself in the mirror. Mascara, eye liner. She licks the lipstick, puzzled. Almost a woman, but it doesn't look right on her. 
HANNA It's like paint. 
SOPHIE Don't lick it off. SOPHIE finishes HANNA's face, looks at her in the mirror. 
SOPHIE (CONT'D) You're gorgeous. 
127 EXT. CAMPSITE. NIGHT. 127 
SOPHIE and HANNA sneak through the campsite together and move secretly between the parked cars. HANNA is dressed in some of SOPHIE's clothes and has the make-up on. They are excited, SOPHIE alive with the thrill of disobedience. 
HANNA I can't walk in this. 
SOPHIE You look hot. 
HANNA Where are we going? 
SOPHIE Shhhhh! HANNA uncomfortable with the situation. 
HANNA I shouldn't take unnecessary risks.

JONES (gravely) Look at this. 
Beck looks at Doc's computer screen. 
ON SCREEN WE SEE DOC'S MESSAGE:  "...hope that our sacrifice will mean that the human race will never know this awful mutation..." 
WILLIE What is it? 
JONES The good doctor signed our death warrant. 
SUDDENLY THERE IS A TREMENDOUS BANGING ON THE DOOR!  LIKE A HUNDRED SLEDGEHAMMERS POUNDING THE HEAVY STEEL DOOR TRYING TO BREAK IT DOWN.  Jones readies his weapon but just as suddenly, the BANGING STOPS.  Beck, Willie and Jones all nervously exchange looks. 
WILLIE Well, at least we're safe inside here. 
JONES For how long? 
Beck slides behind the Console and quickly types in a message.  WE SEE IT ON THE SCREEN.  "SHACK SIX REPORTING. PLEASE DISREGARD PREVIOUS MESSAGE---" 
SUDDENLY MARTIN'S FACE APPEARS ON THE VIDEO SCREEN. 
MARTIN Thank goodness, you're still alive! 
JONES (yells nervously at the screen) Hey, man, you better get your ass out here right now and get us.  You hear me, motherfucker?  Right now! 
Martin smiles calmly back at the three of them. 
MARTIN Please relax, Mr. Jones.  Every- thing is under control.  Naturally, when we received Dr. Warren's message we were concerned but would never have deserted you. 
Jones lets out a breath.  Willie stares straight at the screen. 
WILLIE When are you coming for us? 
MARTIN (smiles nervously) Well, that's the bad news. The typhoon did turn your way. (he looks at weather printout) Right now it is on a course-- 
JONES Just answer the question, man! When are you coming?! 
MARTIN (beat) Hopefully in the next 48 hours. 
BECK Forty-eight hours! 
MARTIN I realize you must have gone through hell-- 
JONES Gone?  Man, we're still here! 
MARTIN (firmly) I can't change the weather. Try to get some rest.  I'll keep you posted. 
He turns off his screen and the picture in front of Beck, Jones and Willie goes blank. 
BECK He's right.  Why don't you get some rest.  I'll stand the first watch. 
TIME CUT TO 
CONTROL ROOM - LATER 
Jones sits near the vent sound asleep, his weapon across his stomach.  Near him Willie lies still, eyes open.  She watches Beck across the room, standing at the window. 
He stares outside into the darkness for a moment, then as if a thought suddenly occurs to him he looks at the blank computer screen. 
CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN 
"Request weather summaries January 14-21."  The cursor blinks back ominously then races across the screen.  "FILE CLOSED." 
BECK (to himself) Martin, you asshole... 
Suddenly he hears a voice behind him. 
WILLIE They know, don't they? 
BECK (quietly) Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us. 
WILLIE Maybe they already have. 
She moves into Doc's seat in front of the console and calls up the stock market program that Bowman was monitoring earlier.

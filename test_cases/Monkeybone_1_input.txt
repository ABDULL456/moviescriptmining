GUEST HEY MONKEYBONE!! 
STU-BONE turns and does a simian COMEDY SHTICK for the crowd. 
STU-BONE That's me, folks! Monkeybone! Let's party! 
By the time he's done scratching his ribs, JULIE has vanished! 
EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON 
She races out of the tent - grabs a passing ZOO GUARD. 
JULIE Please. Where did you take that man...? 
The GUARD points to an ANIMAL CONTROL VAN. JULIE sees O.D. STU peering out through a small barred panel. Their eyes meet... 
JULIE Who are you? Why did you say those things? 
O.D. STU Oh, Doc, it's all a mixup. We were in the land of death. He stole my e-ticket. That's how he got my body, see? All they had left for me was this corpse! 
JULIE digests this, nods professionally, and turns to walk away. 
O.D. STU Don't walk away, Doc! He's only here to give people nightmares! (no response) 
Doc! Please! Don't you remember the dream? They were pulling the plug - I called out to you - and you heard me. Remember? 
This stops JULIE cold. Her spine is tingling. She turns slowly, a single tear rolling down her cheek. And then... 
JULIE BUSTER?!? 
The dog runs right past JULIE and bounds up to the animal control van, barking his head off. Now JULIE is starting to believe. She turns - 
JULIE Stu...how? 
O.D. STU I had to come back, Julie. I had to give you this. 
THROUGH THE BARS he hands her the little box containing Grandma's antique ring. 
O.D. STU I meant to give it to you before. The night we crashed. I was so happy, Julie, I...try to remember me like that, okay? Not like this. 
She slips the ring on her finger - looks up at O.D. STU with TEARS WELLING in her eyes. He makes an odd SNORKELING kind of noise. 
JULIE What's wrong? 
O.D. STU I'm crying too. I just don't have any tears. I'm all dried up. 
JULIE TURNS. The two DETECTIVES we saw in the sleep lab have just arrived at the gate, and ALICE and CLARISSA are leading them over. 
ALICE Detective, please let this man out of the van. 
EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - PIÑATA AREA - THAT MOMENT 
The PARTYGOERS are lined up under the gigantic Stanley-shaped PIÑATA, which is hanging from a tree. A TUBBY BANKER in a blindfold takes a good hard whack. CRACKS are beginning to appear... 
STU-BONE Okay, folks, it's piñata time - you know the rules - five bucks a pop - and remember, it's all for the benefit of our friends the animals! (eyes brightening) Oooooh! This one's on me! 
The next contestant is a GORGEOUS WOMAN. He blindfolds her and embraces her from behind to help her with her grip on the bat. 
STU-BONE Choke up, baby. That's right. Choke up! 
Suddenly he notices the COPS marching up with JULIE, O.D. STU and co. in tow. He freezes, terrified - BACKS AWAY from the BABE - 
- and catches a BAT IN THE FACE. Several people rush up to help him as the COPS consult with the BENEFIT ORGANIZERS... 
ORGANIZER I don't understand, officer. This is a benefit. Surely this can wait until - 
COP Sorry, ma'am...we need to question Mr. Miley on a most urgent matter. 
JULIE Stop this. Now. Those dolls have been tampered with. They're toxic! 
O.D. STU comes marching through the crowd. He passes a LIFE-SIZED DISPLAY of Stanley and Monkeybone...GRABS THE BACKPACK off the Stanley figure...and proceeds deliberately toward STU-BONE. 
O.D. STU MONKEYBONE...BACK IN THE PACK. 
The old command seems to retain its magical power, because STU-BONE clutches his gut as if stricken at the sound of it.

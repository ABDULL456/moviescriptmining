STANLEY Good, cause he's coming out in pieces. Andy races ahead leaving Stanley trying to catch his breath behind him. 
81 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 81 
Andy enters. The shack appears as we first saw it, only now there are remnants of recent life. 
ANDY Matthew! Where the fuck are you! 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 77. Under the table is a pile of filthy old clothes. It almost looks like... a makeshift pillow. He picks up a moldy tin can which once contained some preserved meal. He tosses it to the ground. 
82 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 82 
Stanley waddles out the back of the shack. He stops. About twenty yards away and sees JENNIFER leaning against a tree. 
STANLEY Why you little bitch... Stanley races over - Just as Stanley gets close - SNAP!! A hidden BEAR TRAP clamps down on Stanley's leg - the pain is intense as he screams out - He staggers backwards and falls to the ground in agony 
STANLEY (CONT'D) Oh, God! Oh, my fucking God! ON ANDY: As he exits the Shack to see Stanley on the ground writhing in pain. 
STANLEY (CONT'D) Please! Andy! My fucking leg! Andy races over to assist him. As he offers Stanley his hand, he notices Stanley's eyes catching a glimpse of someone behind him. But as soon as he turns, the wooden BAT, the one from the fishing hole, catches him flush across the face! He's down and before Stanley knows it she cracks him in the back of the head. 
TO BLACK: 
BACK IN ON: 
83 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 83 
Andy's eyes flicker open. He sees a hand wrapping a rusty wire around the contact of an old car battery. Then he looks up and sees a bare light bulb flicker on. He's draped lengthwise over a horse trough so his torso is completely over the basin. His arms and legs are secured with ropes. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 77A. Suddenly, the sound of RUSHING WATER from inside the trough. Andy looks down. A dirty hose hangs over the mouth of the trough. Brown water flows from it... Filling it. 
ANDY 
(PAINED SCREAMS) Help! Somebody! Help me! 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 78. His nose and face are busted - it hurts to scream. With the trough filling up quickly, Andy realizes it won't be long until the water is above his head. He cranes his neck upwards. After all, were he to stay face down, he would drown -- just like Jennifer would've. 
84 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE DAY 84 
STANLEY'S POV: It's Jennifer and in her hand is his video camera. 
JENNIFER I know. You like to watch. Don't you. Don't you worry, I'll give you quite a show. She sets the camera on top of a tri-pod right in front of his face, frames up and hits record. She looks up to him. Stanley's arms are tied behind a tree, his head is held in position, duct tapped back against the tree. His legs are anchored to the ground. The bloody mangled one still in the bear trap that bites and gnaws at his leg with every move. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Since you like to watch. She flips the monitor of the camera toward him just like he did to her. She stands in front of Stanley's face. Stanley wants to say something but his pain is too intense. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Can't talk, can you? Well, maybe it's because you're hungry. Jennifer goes to grabs something behind her. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) You know, you have to eat some real nasty shit out here to stay alive. 
STANLEY Bbbb... bitch! Let me go! She grabs his nose and pulls open his mouth shoving a MAGGOT INFESTED RODENT into his mouth. 
ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 79. 
JENNIFER What's wrong, you don't like it? I prefer the maggots to the meat. Jennifer site down next to Stanley. She glances over to the monitor to see what he is looking at. Then she reaches over and into a burlap sack. Stanley stares straight ahead, at the monitor in front of him. Jennifer reaches into the burlap bag and takes out a roll of fishing line. Then she takes out a pack of fish hooks. Stanley's eyes go wide. Jennifer removes the hooks from their package. She holds one between her thumb and forefinger and studies the barbed tip. Smiling to herself, she threads the hooks with fishing line. 
STANLEY Wh...what are you doing with that? 
JENNIFER

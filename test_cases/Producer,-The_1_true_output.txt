HE TEARS IT UP AND THROWS IT AWAY.  HE PICKS UP ANOTHER AND READS. 
BIALYSTOCK "Congratulations.  Hitler will run forever." 
HE THROWS IT AWAY.  BIALYSTOCK ATTACKS THE PILE OF TELEGRAMS. WITHOUT OPENING THEM UP, HE TEARS THEM ONE AT A TIME. 
BIALYSTOCK (boiling with rage) Congratulations! 
HE TEARS TELEGRAM. 
BIALYSTOCK Congratulations! 
HE TEARS TELEGRAM. 
BIALYSTOCK Congratulations! 
HE TEARS TELEGRAM. 
BIALYSTOCK Congratulations! 
HE TEARS TELEGRAM. 
THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.  POSED IN THE DOORWAY IS ROGER DE BRIS. IN ONE HAND HE CARRIES AN OPEN, BUBBLING MAGNUM OF CHAMPAGNE. 
DE BRIS (ecstatic) Congratulations!  Have you seen the reviews?  Have you seen the lines at the box office?  It's a torrent, it's an avalanche, it's the biggest hit on Broadway! 
HE STARTS INTO THE ROOM.  BIALYSTOCK GROWLS AND LUNGES AT HIM. 
BIALYSTOCK You lousy fruit.  You've ruined me! 
HE SMASHES DE BRIS UP AGAINST THE WALL.  THE CHAMPAGNE GOES FLYING. 
DE BRIS (shrieking) Help!  Help!  He's crazy!  He's going to kill me.  Call the police! Call the police!  Help, help, murder, murder, rape, rape!!! 
BIALYSTOCK THROWS HIM OUT, SLAMS THE DOOR AND LOCKS IT.  HE FALLS INTO THE CHAIR AND PUTS HIS FEET UP ON THE DESK. 
BIALYSTOCK (moaning) How could this happen?  I was so careful.  I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast. Where did I go right?  We forgot one important, Bloom.  Adolf Hitler always drew a crowd. 
BIALYSTOCK IS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT BLOOM IS DOING STRANGE THINGS AT THE NEXT DESK. 
BIALYSTOCK What are you doing? 
CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS FEVERISHLY PILING LEDGERS AND ACCOUNT BOOKS TOGETHER.  HE SWOOPS THEM UP IN HIS ARMS, CLUTCHES THEM TIGHTLY AND BEGINS BACKING TOWARDS THE DOOR. 
BLOOM (defensively) Don't try to stop me.  I've made up my mind. 
BIALYSTOCK What are you doing with those books? Where are you going? 
BLOOM (with hysterical conviction) I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long. 
HE TURNS THE KNOB.  THE DOOR IS LOCKED.  HE FIDDLES WITH THE CATCH.  TOO LATE!  BIALYSTOCK IS UP AND AT HIM IN A FLASH. HE BLOCKS THE DOOR. 
BIALYSTOCK (reasonably) Leo, take it easy.  Relax, you're overwrought.  You don't know what you're doing.  You're acting out of panic... GIMME THOSE BOOKS! 
BIALYSTOCK LUNGES AT BLOOM AND GRABS FOR THE BOOKS.  BLOOM STILL RETAINS A FIRM HOLD.  THEY STRUGGLE BACK AND FORTH. 
BLOOM I never should have listened to you. 
BIALYSTOCK I never should have listened to you. 
BLOOM Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.

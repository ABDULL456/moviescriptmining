DOUG ROTH If we could move off the subject of business for a moment, I'm curious whether the world's smartest man thinks we're headed for our next World War. Adrian stops the treadmill, towels off as he heads to Dan. 
ADRIAN Predicting stock prices isn't the same as predicting world events. I hope there isn't a war, or even a skirmish for that matter. Because Veidt Enterprises has some exciting plans, plans that will, pardon the cliche, truly make this world a better place. My team of engineers and scientists have been working with Dr. Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new, cheap form of energy which will eliminate the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with no toxic emissions. This energy could power cars, aircrafts, stadiums--there are no limitations-- (reaching Dan)

(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) --but I talk too much. Will you mind pausing the interview a moment, Doug? A good friend of mine is here. Doug Roth leaves. Adrian hugs Dan, despite the sweat. 
DAN You look good, Adrian. 
ADRIAN Dan--it's been far too long. 
INT. ADRIAN VEIDT'S OFFICE - LATER 
Dan and Adrian sit, talking over coffee. Dan examines an ACTION-FIGURE of Adrian as OZYMANDIAS (his superhero alias). 
ADRIAN Rorschach. He paid me a visit too. 
DAN He did? Must've been tough to get past your security, even for him. I thought your assistant was going to take me out. 
ADRIAN 
(LAUGHS) Sara can be tough. Is that why you came to see me? You're worried about this mask killer theory Rorschach's conjured up? 
DAN You're the world's smartest man, Adrian. You tell me. 
ADRIAN Rorschach's a sociopath suffering through nostalgia. I revealed my identity to the public as soon as the Keene Act was passed. If an old enemy wanted me dead it would have been done already. Adrian notices the news on one of his TV projectors. Something about Pakistan putting troops along the Indian border. Adrian turns up the volume, looking grim. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) No, there are other things in the world I'm far more concerned about. ON THE WALL: The TV projector shows an image of TWO PAKISTANI SOLDIERS on patrol. 
EXT. PAKISTAN/INDIA BORDER (KASHMIR) - SAME TIME 
We're now actually with the two Soldiers on patrol. One of the Soldiers takes out a pair of binoculars, looking into the mountains. (They speak in Baluchi) 
PAKISTANI SOLDIER We should attack the Indian bastards. I don't understand-- CUT TO: POV--a SNIPER SCOPE, locked in on the Pakistani soldier. 
INDIAN SOLDIER #1 (O.S.) --why I can't just pull this trigger. We see two Indian Soldiers, hidden in the mountains, one with his sniper rifle aimed. (They speak in Hindi) 
INDIAN SOLDIER #2 Because then a battle begins. Then a war. And then the Americans will send-- 
INT. BRIDGE - BATTLESHIP - CHINESE WATERS - SAME TIME 
CHINESE CAPTAIN (in Mandarin) --their blue abomination to intervene. And we don't want that. At the same time, we can't assume to know what's on the minds of our enemies. We're in Chinese waters, off the coast of Taiwan. The CHINESE CAPTAIN and his First Mate look out at the water. TAIWANESE GUNBOATS can be seen in the distance. 
INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - ISRAEL - SAME TIME 
We're in the control room as an ISRAELI OFFICER and his much younger AIDE watch SATELLITE IMAGES on the giant screen. Images of potential targets. (They speak in Hebrew) 
AIDE Is Dr. Manhattan even real? 
ISRAELI OFFICER Why don't you ask the Vietnamese. Or the Iraqis? Dr. Manhattan is real. Thank god for that. 
EXT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - EVENING 
A SIGN posted on a RAZOR-WIRE FENCE reads: ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER. An M16-toting GUARD stands at the gate. We move into Rorschach's POV as he approaches the gate. The guard has no reaction to Rorschach-- --because Rorschach is in disguise, wearing the Army Officer's uniform he stole. Rorschach presents his ID. The Guard waves him through. 
INT. HALLWAY - DR. MANHATTAN'S COMPOUND - EVENING 
Rorschach ditches the uniform in the trash and puts his mask on. He quietly enters-- 
INT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS 
--a huge room, which contains technologically advanced MILITARY DEVICES. Distorted in sections of GLASS, we see the REFLECTION of a HUGE MAN, GLOWING BRIGHT BLUE-- 
DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.) Good evening, Rorschach. --and we see DR. MANHATTAN (formerly Jon Osterman) for the very first time. He is SIXTY FEET TALL, BLUE LIGHT ripples from his skin, emanating pure power--he is God on earth. He works on a reactor--telekinetically moving parts in the air-- not even looking at Rorschach. It's as if Dr. Manhattan already knew he was coming. 
RORSCHACH Dr. Manhattan. Dr. Manhattan continues about his business when his girlfriend, LAURIE JUPITER, 30, very much in her prime, enters from the other end. 
LAURIE Jon, did you say some--Rorschach: What are you doing here? You're a wanted man. 
RORSCHACH Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre. 
LAURIE Don't call me that. My mother made me take that name. I always hated it.

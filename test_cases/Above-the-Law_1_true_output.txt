JACKSON (CONT'D) They're refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Chile. They won't talk                  * to me, they're terrified of cops. 
Jackson has an armload of notes, including photocopies of news clippings. 
JACKSON Ready for this? One of the people killed at the church was definitely not a congregation member. 
She shows Nico and Lukich the Polaroids we saw her take in the morgue. JACKSON Alan Singletary. He's an aide to Senator Harrison. Nico is electrified. JACKSON That's right. Harrison. Foreign relations committee. The guy who's been crawling all over the Central American drug connections. NICO (impressed) You're gonna make a helluva D.A., Jax. LUKICH God help us. 
JACKSON (savors the com- pliment) I've been at the Tribune all night, wearing out their Xerox machine. Harrison's staff has been compiling some kind of white paper. He's due to release it next week. Nico's mind races. 
NICO That's how Fox knew. JACKSON What? 
Nico turns to Lukich, dead earnest. 
ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           60. 
NICO Luke. I  want you to go to my house.  Call Branca... my mother has the number. Get my family ready to move out. LUKICH You got it, buddy. 
NICO Stay with 'em. We'll be there. LUKICH What's going on, Nico?   What happened? NICO I got a call last night. An old agency friend. He told me my family was in danger. Jax and Lukich can't put all the pieces together yet.    But if it's drugs-CIA-Senate, it's got to be heavy. LUKICH You got a weapon? Lukich knows he doesn't. He glances up and down the street, makes sure no one's watching -- then cracks the driver's door of his car. There's a bulge in the map pocket. Nico  pulls out a Sig Saur .45. LUKICH Try this on. Jackson watches Luke slip Nico a clip.                         * CUT TO: 
217   INT. DAY CARE CENTER (BEHIND CHURCH) - MORNING OPENING CLOSE ON the faces of the sanctuary refugees. They are faces that have known fear and tragedy. The kind of faces we see on newsreels after villages have been burned and family members murdered. The refugees have been moved from church basement to a back room in the day care center. Nico kneels, facing them. Jackson in the background. A nun (SISTER BONIFACIA) and a priest (whom we saw in Genarro's hospital room) watch over the people. Nico is frustrated; he can't crack the refugees' fear. NICO (to nun) Sister... you know me. Tell them there's no need for fear. 
SISTER BONIFACIA There is rubble all over the yard, Nicola. 
(THE REST OF THE SCENE MAY BE IN ENGLISH, OR SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES, AT THE DIRECTOR'S DISCRETION.) NICO (to refugees) I was there... in the church. They tried to kill my family, too. Several of the refugees look like they want to speak, but they are terrified. NICO I know there was a man here, from an American senator's office. Who was he going to speak to? The refugees become increasingly anxious. NICO (to one woman) Was it you, senora? (to a man) Was it you? More silence.    Glances among the people.   Finally: REFUGEE WOMAN The priest. The others shrink.   The Woman glances to them. NICO Who? (gently) Father Genarro? 
REFUGEE WOMAN The other one. 
Nico looks to the American priest standing there. REFUGEE WOMAN No. The young one. From Costa Rica. 
Sister Bonifacia sighs. SISTER BONIFACIA Father Tomassino. 
Jackson has her pad out, taking notes. Bonifacia knows too much has already been revealed; she must speak. 
SISTER BONIFACIA He came alone... two weeks ago. He had papers. Papers to give to the senator. 
Nico tries to contain his excitement; not scare anyone by losing his calm. 
NICO But the bomb... The bomb was planted to destroy the pulpit. SISTER BONIFACIA Father Tomassino was going to give the Mass that day. (shaken) Father Genarro talked him out of it. 
The refugees' faces confirm this. NICO (understands) It was Father Tomassino they were trying to kill. 
Bonifacia starts softly to cry.    Nico puts his hand on her shoulder, comforting her. NICO Where is Tomassino?   Where is he now? The nun shakes her head.   Nico looks to the refugees. They don't know, either. 
REFUGEE MAN He run, mister. He go -- 
He gestures: "who knows where?" NICO If you know where he is, you've got to tell me. I want to help him. I can help him. The refugees lower their eyes. Bonifacia continues her soft weeping. Nico glances to Jackson; her look says "Enough, let's leave these poor people alone." Nico stands, touches Bonifacia one more time on the shoulder -- 218   EXT. CHURCH DAY CARE BUILDING - DAY

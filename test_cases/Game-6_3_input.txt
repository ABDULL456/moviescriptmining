STEVEN If you're wondering about the firearm. 
LAUREL Yes. 
STEVEN This building is not secure. 
They are all over the sofa, working on the removal of Steven's shirt. 
INT. THE ENTRANCEWAY Nicky makes his way past the debris. The front door is gone, the inner door smashed and battered -- door knobs gone and locking mechanism ripped out. 
He starts up the stairs past a dead or sleeping body. 
INT. THE LOFT On the sofa, Laurel is straddling Steven, whose shirt is almost completely off, exposing his bulletproof vest. Laurel is blouseless and barefoot, with her unzipped skirt still on and her bra dangling from one shoulder. 
LAUREL I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself. 
STEVEN We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty. 
LAUREL What do we want? 
STEVEN Mystery. Deception. 
LAUREL Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy. 
STEVEN What's sexy? 
LAUREL Knowing who a person is. Down deep. 
STEVEN Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking? 
LAUREL You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name? 
Steven maneuvers himself into a sitting position so that he and Laurel face each other at equal height and at close quarters. 
STEVEN Even if the truth requires a certain adjustment? 
Steven begins removing the cosmetic putty around his naturally shallow chin. He uses Laurel's hair clip to scrape his jaw clean. Then he peels off his fake mustache. And borrows Laurel's dangling bra cup to wipe the bronzing agent off his face. 
INT. THE LANDING Nicky stands with his back to Steven's door. His gun is out. He holds it up near his face, muzzle pointed up. 
He looks at the gun as if it had feelings and personality, and he speaks to it as to a sympathetic friend. 
NICKY I used to go to the movies all the time. (MORE) 
NICKY(cont'd) I saw a hundred situations like this. A man and a gun -- and a locked door. Lee Marvin or Steve McQueen. And I used to say to Lillian because we went to a hundred movies that we saw together or that I saw because she had seen them, and I'd say, `Watch him kick in the door with one kick,' And it might be Steve McQueen or Jeff Chandler, holding the gun up like this, and he would turn and kick the door and it would fly open at once, and I would say to Lillian, `How completely phony. Whoever made this movie has no idea how hard it is to kick in an actual door in real life.' I still love Lillian. But it's not easy to kick in a door. I knew they would lose and they lost, so what are we so upset about? They lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's written on the wind. INT. THE LOFT Laurel is on her feet, backing away slightly. Steven removed his shoes and stands in his stocking feet, noticeably shorter than he'd been earlier. 
He begins to unstrap the bulletproof vest, causing Laurel to retreat further. 
INT. THE LANDING NICKY These wives named Lillian. I used to say to her, `You don't kick a door once or twice and expect it to open. It's only in the movies a man can kick in a door with such amazing ease. Because a real door requires a tremendous and prolonged pounding before it finally gives way.' He's a great player...how could that ball go through his legs? 
Nicky turns, steps back and kicks the door. It opens at once. 
INT. THE LOFT Steven and Laurel are briefly immobilized by shock as the door comes flying open. 
Nicky moves toward the candle-lit couple.

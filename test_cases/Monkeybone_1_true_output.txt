STU-BONE bends over - jerks and twitches - becoming more SIMIAN by the moment as O.D. STU approaches. 
STU-BONE Stu...I can explain...I was sick of being a figment, see? It's awful being a figment. It's degrading! And I never really wanted to give people nightmares. I just told 'em that so they'd help me get a body. 
O.D. STU Yeah - my body. Back in the pack, you simian shitbird! 
The COPS are tres confused by all this - 
COP Ma'am, can you give me some idea of what's going on here? 
- but JULIE holds them back so the scene can play itself out. Now STU- BONE is doing a weird little monkey dance - PLAYING UP to the puzzled crowd, who laugh and snicker, wondering what to make of all this. 
STU-BONE Laugh, damn you...laugh at the sidekick...the happy little monkey. He doesn't have any feelings. He's just a figment of your immagination! 
He turns suddenly - GRABS THE BAT from the puzzled BABE - 
STU-BONE GIMME THAT GODDAM BAT! 
He wails on the piñata like Ken Griffey Jr. O.D. STU tries to stop him, but it's too late - the piñata BURSTS, and hundreds of PURPLE-ASSED MONKEYBONE DOLLS spill out onto the ground! 
An equal number of RABID PARTYGOERS surge forward to scoop them up. The COPS swing into action, trying to hold the crowd back... 
COP HE'S GETTING AWAY! 
STU-BONE climbs a tree and JUMPS from a branch onto one of the TWIN JUNGLE TOWERS at the pavilion - begins CLIMBING toward the giant MONKEYBONE BALLOON moored up above! 
O.D. STU sees him - pulls away from JULIE - 
O.D. STU I LOVE YOU! 
JULIE STU!! 
STU-BONE unties the mooring rope and wraps it around his midsection. Now freed, the balloon LIFTS INTO THE AIR, CARRYING HIM ALOFT! 
O.D. STU climbs up the opposite tower as the balloon starts to drift away. He GRABS HOLD of the MOORING ROPE as it whips past. 
And the TEAM OF SURGEONS - who have been combing the grounds in search of O.D. STU - catch sight of him just as he FLOATS OFF INTO THE AIR, ON THE END OF THE ROPE! 
HEAD SURGEON LOOK! IT'S HIM! 
EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - ON BALLOON - MOVING 
They rise to an altitude of ten or twelve feet. But O.D. STU's additional weight pulls the balloon back DOWN - and both of them hit the ground! They have to RUN at top speed just to keep pace with the balloon! 
STU-BONE Let...go...you...dingleberry... 
As he's trying to KICK O.D. STU off the rope, a GUST OF WIND catches the balloon and LIFTS IT HIGH INTO THE AIR. 
For about three seconds. The boys tumble to earth, off-balance, in a heap, BOUNCING along the pavement. The balloon pulls them over a WROUGHT-IRON FENCE and drags them through the ALLIGATOR PIT. Giant jaws snap as the boys glide overhead like bait on a hook. 
As the balloon LIFTS UP AGAIN, O.D. STU hauls himself along the length of the rope. 
He gets close enough to GRAB STU-BONE's LEG. STU-BONE reaches down to push him away...grabs a fistful of DUCT TAPE... 
...and RIP! The tape TEARS - exposing the great big GASH in O.D. STU's midsection! He tries to pull himself together... 
EXT. FOOD COURT - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 
A SERVER ladles out a cup of PUNCH from a big silver PUNCHBOWL. Something PINK comes plummeting out of the sky - and the next thing he knows, the SERVER is DRENCHED! 
The SURGEONS come rushing up. They all stick their hands in the punchbowl at once...fishing out O.D. STU'S KIDNEY! 
HEAD SURGEON Put it on ice. I think it can still be saved! 
One of the TEAM finds an ice cooler full of soft drinks. In it goes. 
EXT. TIGER HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON 
BOTH BOYS SCREAM as the balloon drags them perilously close to the RAZOR WIRE atop a tall storm fence. 
They clear it by inches - but they don't have much time to celebrate. They're dangling over the Bengal Tiger exhibit, and the great cats are LEAPING INTO THE AIR trying to snag them! 
As O.D. STU squirms out of reach, his LIVER drops out... 
EXT. GROUNDS - TIGER HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON

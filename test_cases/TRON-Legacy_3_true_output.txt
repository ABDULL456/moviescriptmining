123   INT.   PORTAL 
Plexor tenses, eager for the slaughter. 
X-Takks cock weapons, take careful aim. 
124   INT.   DARK PORTAL 
Flynn, Code Monkeys, Quantz, Boole, Krod...       Gathering near Rush - 
PORTAL OPENS AROUND THEM, revealing a stunning view of: 
The inside of the fortress... 
Not an X-Takk in sight. 
KROD Nothing to it. 
Rush leads group inside. 
125   INT.   "EXECUTION PORTAL" 
Plexor grows impatient.     Senses trouble. 
PLEXOR OPEN IT!   OPEN FIRE! 
X-Net Specialist activates portal.     Semispheric aperture irises open to reveal: 
X-Takk Patrol.   Charging in from outside. 
No fighters in sight. 
125   CONTINUED: 
Inside-X-Takks and outside-X-Takks take orders literally: 
They FIRE at EACH OTHER.      Many crash, zap and fizzle. 
Cybavors leap in, devouring corrupted X-Takks. The two Cybavors use energy "food" to bifurcate into FOUR. 
PLEXOR CEASE FIRE! 
They do so, instantly. 
Plexor fumes. 
PLEXOR You've been tricked! 
He spins to find Mega gone. 
PLEXOR Mega has betrayed me for the last time! She is with the fighters! Find them! CRASH THEM ALL! 
126   INT.   X-NET CENTRAL SERVER 
Mega RUNS from the scene. Around a corner, she collides with Rush, Flynn, Krod & Fighters. Breathless: 
MEGA Flynn!   Keep moving!    This way! 
FLYNN I'm proud of you, Mega. 
MEGA I linked with MEG.     Users exist. She instructed me. 
RUSH Go, Meg! 
She glances over the new "tronified" Rush. Despite herself, she's impressed. But there's no time for talk. 
RUSH Which way to the power supply?! 
KROD (scanning) Ummmm... That way! 
126   CONTINUED: 
Rush leaps to a high ledge to confirm: Massive throbbing power supply CORE CUBE lies at the center of the fortress's concentric squares. High sign to Krod. 
TRON You're right! There it is! 
KROD And here they come! 
Rumble precedes:    ARMY of X-Takks, coming to get them. 
CODE MONK J2R Break out the toys! 
X-Takks are upon them, and the battle is joined. 
X-Net disks fly by the hundreds. 
Krod and Code Monkeys fire a SQRAM projectile, which opens mid-air into a super-wide circular magnetic field "net". 
SQRAM field sucks in X-Net disk and zaps them to ash. 
X-Takks charge. 
Rush flips down from above, throws tron-disk - 
Disk ricochets of ten X-Takks, mows them down. 
Rush retrieves his disk, lands near Krod and Fighters. 
RUSH Block this choke point, slow them down. Can you guys do it? 
QUANTZ Not a problem. 
He throws his disk behind his back, takes out an approaching X-Net goon.

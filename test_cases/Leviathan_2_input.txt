Beck lays Jones head back against the life jacket.  For a moment.  Jones seems lifeless, then his eyes blink and squint against the sunlight.  Beck turns back to Willie and as he and Jones ride the next crest he gives her the "thumbs-up." 
WILLIE(cont'd) (jubilant) The sun!  The sun! 
Jones looks at Beck and grins. 
JONES What happened to that typhoon? 
CALM SEA - LATER 
BECK, WILLIE AND JONES cling to each other as they search the horizon. 
WILLIE Are you sure you saw something? 
JONES How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship. 
WILLIE Well, why haven't they answered our flares? 
BECK We'll fire one more, that leaves us one last one. 
BECK pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark water.  The light fades, Willie looks at Jones. 
WILLIE Are you okay, Jonesy? 
JONES (weakly) Tip top, Willie...tip top. 
WILLIE (testing him) Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson? 
JONES (tired, but with fight) Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...? 
They both manage a weak laugh, then Beck sees something. 
BECK I'll be damned.  Look!...A flare! 
As a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just fading against the sky. 
WILLIE It saw us! 
JONES Answer them and quit kicking me! 
WILLIE I'm not touching you! 
WHOOOOOOOOSH!  Beck fires another flare into the sky.  As the flare arcs downward, Willie feels another bump and for the first time sees the SHARKS CIRCLING THEM. 
WILLIE No...no, no, no. 
The SHARKS tighten the circle as the flare fades. 
EXT. U.S. COASTGUARD SHIP'S BRIDGE - SAME 
A CAPTAIN watches the flare fade through his binoculars and speaks to someone O.S. 
CAPTAIN I thought you said you'd combed this area? 
He lowers his binoculars AS WE WIDEN TO REVEAL MARTIN standing on the bridge.  He also lowers his binoculars and smiles coolly as he lies. 
MARTIN We did....Many times. 
CAPTAIN (looks at Martin then to a Lieutenant) Initiate rescue. 
We hold on Martin's face as from 
THE FORE DECK OF THE SHIP 
A rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks off toward the fading flare. 
OCEAN - SAME 
Jones, Willie and Beck stay bunched close together. Suddenly Willie feels another bump. 
WILLIE (panicky) It hit me!  Where are they?! 
BECK I can't see them!

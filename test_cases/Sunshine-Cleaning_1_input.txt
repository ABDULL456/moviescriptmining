FADE IN: 
1   EXT. ALBUQUERQUE - DAY                                            1 
ROSE LORKOWSKI, 30, drives through Albuquerque. She passes small adobe houses, the Air force base, parched earth playgrounds, University cafes and other distinctive sights. 
On the   highway she passes under the freeway interchange, a tangle   of rust and turquoise ramps. The Sandia mountains rise in the   distance as Rose heads up to the nicer neighborhoods of the   foothills. 
2   EXT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - DAY                                     2 
Rose pulls up to an expensive looking Spanish style house and parks. She gets out of the car, pops the hatch and pulls out a vacuum cleaner and assorted cleaning supplies. 
3   INT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                       3 
Rose drags a vacuum cleaner into a room where expensive decor collides with the debris of a recent party. 
She collects beer bottles from end tables, book shelves and house plants. Cigarette butts float in cocktail glasses. 
Rose plugs in the vacuum cord and glances out the sliding glass doors. A group of twenty somethings frolic in the pool. 
A lanky trust funder slides open the door and drips water onto the carpet as he makes his way to retrieve a cold beer. 
He brushes past Rose on his way back out. Rose turns on the vacuum and wonders if he even saw her. 
4   INT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY                                   4 
The space is packed with every kind of snack imaginable. JOE LORKOWSKI, 53, talks as the OWNER stocks shelves. 
OWNER I've got the five stores here and then two in Rio Rancho.

JOE That's fantastic. See, if we're talking that kind of volume I can absolutely massage the numbers a little. Seriously, you're not gonna be able to keep it on the shelf. 
Joe pulls out some order forms. 
OWNER Yeah, I'd need to look at some things before I can place an order. 
The owner looks at Joe's business card. 
OWNER How about I give you a call if I decide to-- 
JOE I'll call you. Not a problem. No problem at all. Even better, I'll swing by. You're on my route. How `bout that? I'll swing by tomorrow. 
OWNER Yeah, tomorrow's not good. 
JOE Thursday then. That's better anyway. That'll give you a chance to take a look see on those other stores. We'll put everything on one order and get you a good price break. 
The owner seems to consider the offer. Joe scans the shelves. 
JOE My advice to you - weed out some of this weaker product to make more space for the corn. Like this... 
Joe reaches over and grabs a packet of organic fruit bar. 
JOE Apricot Fruit Leather. Whose bright idea was it to stock that? I mean come on, what self respecting kid asks his mom for apricot fruit leather?

The owner is not amused. 
5   EXT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY                                 5 
Joe pulls a hand cart stacked high with Fancy Corn canisters to his rusted Monte Carlo. 
6   EXT. LUCKY BOY RESTAURANT - DAY                                 6 
Through the glass pane we see disgruntled waitress, NORAH LORKOWSKI (25). She appears to be in a heated argument with MR. KIM, the restaurant owner. A customer watches the exchange with amusement. 
Norah takes off her apron, throws it at Mr. Kim. Norah exits the restaurant. Mr. Kim trails her. Then MRS. KIM notices and joins the fray. 
MR. KIM You are fired. 
NORAH I so don't care. 
Norah flips him off and walk down the street. As she continues to walk she realizes that quitting her job might not have been the best decision ever. 
NORAH Fuck.

7    INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY                          7 
A banana floats in the toilet. OSCAR LORKOWSKI, 7, smiles and kicks the flush lever. Whoosh... the banana is sucked down the drain. Gone. 
Well, not quite. Oscar watches water fill the basin and spill onto the floor. Oscar turns and walks out. 
8    INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                           8 
Oscar steps from the bathroom and walks quickly down the empty hall. 
9    INT. BUSINESSMAN'S CAR -   SPORTING GOODS STORE LOT - DAY        9 
A BUSINESSMAN removes a single shotgun shell from the glove compartment. He drops it in his shirt pocket, sprays breath freshener in his mouth and gets out of his car.

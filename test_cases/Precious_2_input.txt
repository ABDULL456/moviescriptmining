PRECIOUS I'm getting my G.E.D., a job, and a place for me and Abdul, then I go to college. I don't want to 'home attend' nobody! 
JERMAINE You better put this shit back before you get in trouble. We talk about it with Ms. Rain in the morning. 
133   INT. ADVANCEMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY                       133 
Precious hurries into a room carrying Abdul. The sign on the door says "DAYCARE". 
Precious dashes out of the room alone. 
WOMAN'S (0.S.) And don't be coming back late for his bad ass neither. 
134   EXT STREET - DAY                                           134 
Precious marches to school with her bookbag and red scarf. She clearly has a lot on her mind. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Miz Weiss just part of the gang but definitely not cool. And social worker look at me like I am ugly freak who did something to make my own life like it is. I guess I am trying to figure out just what has happened to me while Miz Weiss just hell bent on making me go wipe old people's asses. 
Precious crosses the street. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Got to sort dis out quick tho 'fore Abdul's next birthday -coming up fast. 
135   INT. HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY                         135 
The whole class writes until Ms. Rain looks at her watch and... 
(CONTINUED) 
135   CONTINUED:                                               135 MS. RAIN Time is up. Does anyone want to share? 
The only hand up belongs to Precious'. 
MS. RAIN Okay Precious. 
PRECIOUS I don't really want to read all I wrote, I jus' wanna kinda say what it is I'm writing about and how it came about. 
AISHA What happened? 
PRECIOUS Well, to make a long story short, the counselor at Advancement House quizzing me about Mama and Daddy etc., etc. But it's really about workfare. She want to send me out as home attendant. 
RHONDA How you know? 
PRECIOUS Cause I stole my file from Advancement House and read it. 
The class GASPS. 
JO ANN Next time get mine's too. 
PRECIOUS All this 'What you wanna be?' And 'You can talk to me.' They ain' no motherfucking therapists on our side, they just flunkies for the 'fare. I wanna work, but not for no motherfucking welfare check in Central Park -displacing brothers and sisters who really got jobs cleaning up 'cause I'm there working for free. 
Jermaine speaks while slouched in her chair with her feet crossed and arms folded.

135   CONTINUED: (2)                                         135 JERMAINE And what kinda shit is it for someone like Precious to have quit school before she get her G.E.D. to work at some live-in job for some old-ass crackers. She'll never make a rise she get stuck in some shit like that! 
MS. RAIN Sit up straight Jermaine and watch your language. Both of you. Please. 
Jermaine reluctantly sits up. 
MS. RAIN Now I see your points, but is stealing... 
PRECIOUS Miz Rain, If I didn't steal that file I wouldn't know what I was facing! 
MS. RAIN You read the whole thing by yourself? 
PRECIOUS Yeah...basically. 
JO ANN Rhonda home attend. Say old bitch would ring a bell when she want Rhonda in the night! 
JERMAINE Rhonda used to have to go all the way out to Brighton Beach where she work for them people. 
PRECIOUS The people had her there all day and night - 'on call' they call it. But you only get pay for 8 hours so that's 8 X $6.37 (referring to her notebook) = $50.96 a day, but then you is not really getting that much cause you is working more than eight hours a day. You is working 24 hours a day and 50.96 divided by 24 is...

135   CONTINUED: (3)                                         135 (referring to her notebook) $2.12 by my count. 
JO ANN Rhonda say old bitch would ring a bell - a actual bell -when she want Rhonda in the night! 
PRECIOUS Home attendants usually work six days a week. I would only see Abdul on Sundays? When would I go to school? (beat) Am I gonna hafta go be home attendant like Rhonda was? 
MS. RAIN No! So stop worrying about it. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Trust me -no, trust yourself. My concern now is that if this Ms. Weiss is someone you're working with and can't trust, she's out! We gotta find somebody else. 
PRECIOUS (beat) Well, I just write in my notebook till I get wif some kinda therapist I can trust. Actually that always help me more than talking to her. Plus, I'm going to start going to meetings wif Rita for insect survivors.

WAYNE This is crazy. You can't escape like this. 
MICKEY Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try. 
WAYNE We'll all be killed. 
MALLORY Exciting, isn't it? 
Duncan begins to cry. 
MICKEY Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it? 
MALLORY Are we in a big hurry? 
MICKEY You got something you want to do? 
MALLORY Yeah. 
MICKEY By all means, knock yourself out. 
MALLORY Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut. 
Roger snaps up and hoists the camera to his shoulder. 
VIDEO FOOTAGE: 
Shot through Roger's CAMERA: IMAGE FOCUSES on Mallory as she points to Scagnetti sitting on the floor. 
MALLORY You! Stand up! 
Scagnetti gulps, then rises knowing that he has fucked with the wrong woman. 
Mallory walks up to him with pistol in hand. 
MALLORY You probably thought it was pretty funny, didn't ya? 
She raises Scagnetti's pistol, aiming it at its former owner. Scagnetti flinches and squirms. 
MALLORY Can you remember the last time you fucked with me? Close your eyes and remember...Are ya thinking about it? Good. 
Mallory fires three shots into Scagnetti's chest. 
Roger's CAMERA jumps, then follows the body to the floor. Roger HOLDS on Scagnetti slumped on the floor. 
DUNCAN (O.S.) Oh God! Oh God! Ohhhh... 
MICKEY We're sending out a hostage. Don't touch him! 
OFF SCREEN the door is kicked open. 
Roger's CAMERA whips around to witness Mickey and Mallory jumping into the corridor, BLASTING with their guns while using the hostages for shields. Roger's CAMERA moves out of the cell and... 
INT. JAIL CORRIDOR (OUTSIDE THE HOLDING CELL) - DAY 
There are even more DEPUTY SHERIFFS in the corridor. 
CROSS FIRE whistles by as Roger dodges to catch up with the caravan. 
The footage is very similar to Vietnam footage. It's shaky, real, harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle. 
The soundtrack is a mixture of yelling, crying, laughing, and gunfire. 
HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 is SHOT, and discarded by Mickey. 
The wild caravan runs down the hallway, FIRING behind them. 
Mickey's HIT, but keeps on running and FIRING. Mallory sees this and screams. 
MALLORY Mickey! 
MICKEY Don't stop! 
Roger's CAMERA runs along with them. 
ROGER (O.S.) Man, oh, man...this is better than Vietnam! 
More DEPUTIES appear at the end of the hallway. 
Mickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using DUNCAN as a shield in front of them and Wayne behind them. Mickey FIRES from the front, Mallory FIRES from the rear. 
DUNCAN Please don't kill me! Don't kill me... 
CAMERA WHIP PANS to catch a Deputy hopping around the corner. The SCREEN FLASHES WHITE with a BLAST. 
Roger's HIT, and the CAMERA goes haywire, reeling out of control, the THUNKING to the ground. Roger screams O.S.

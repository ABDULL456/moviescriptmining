MAN That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful. 
BRENNA There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it. (smiles) The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me. 
MAN You're very macabre. 
BRENNA It's my birthday. 
MAN Happy birthday. 
BRENNA Thanks. 
Brenna drains her glass and sets it down with a sigh. 
BRENNA Buy a birthday girl a drink? 
50  INT. PUB - NIGHT                                                50 
A small neighborhood tavern.  Regulars chat amicably with the BARTENDER-OWNER. 
TAUPIN 
Sits alone at a corner table.  A WAITRESS hovers over him. 
TAUPIN Lager and lime. 
LATER 
Taupin's lager is drained.  Lost in thought, he drags a finger around and around the lip of the mug. 
He hand stops.  It twitches.  Shakes. 
Taupin pulls his hand from the glass and watches it shake slightly out of control.  A warning. 
He WHIRLS around suddenly to see LING KAHN, Asian, standing over him. 
KAHN MacLeod. 
Taupin is anxious, poised for attack. 
Kahn breaks into a broad smile. 
KAHN Spare a chair? 
TAUPIN Kahn? 
KAHN Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night? 
TAUPIN Sit. 
Kahn takes his place across the table. 
TAUPIN (unsure) How are you? 
KAHN Head still secure to the neck. 
TAUPIN How did you find me? 
KAHN How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime? 
Taupin looks to his own glass. 
KAHN Old habits die hard. (to waitress) Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic! (beat) Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence. 
TAUPIN What are you doing here? 
KAHN It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores. 
Taupin tenses. 
TAUPIN And have you something to settle with me? 
KAHN (smiles) Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend. 
TAUPIN It's good to see you, Kahn. 
The waitress sets down two glasses. 
KAHN Come, toast with me the past. (raises glass) To old conquests, old loves, and to a time when we cared about either. 
Kahn drains his glass. 
KAHN Waitress! 
51  EXT. THE WASHINGTON MALL - NIGHT                                51 
Kahn and Taupin sit drunkedly on the marble steps of a closed government building.

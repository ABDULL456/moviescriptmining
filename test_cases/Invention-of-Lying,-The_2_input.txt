MARK Yeah, no I was being... (pause; searching) ...there's no word for it. See you tomorrow night. 
JENNIFER Bye. 
Mark hangs up happily. 
MOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V) In Our World.... in the 1800's... 
PAN ON TV: The screen is all black. 
MOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V) ... came the greatest revolution of them all. (climactic music) The Industrial Revolution. 
The black fades to ANGELO BADSMITH, a middle-aged African American man sitting before a fire in a green smoking jacket, holding a script. 
MOVIE TRAILER VOICE (ON T.V) Written by famed screenwriter Rob Marlowe and read by Oscar winning Reader Angelo Badsmith. 
ANGELO BADSMITH Hello, I'm Angelo Badmsith. Come watch me read about the exciting events that took place during the Industrial Revolution. (MORE) 
ANGELO BADSMITH (cont'd) Also, I will tell you all about my personal misfortunes, such as my wife who cheated on me with a man named Perry. 
The screen reads: "The Industrial Revolution. Summer `07." 
BACK ON MARK: His eyes are wide. The wheels in his head are spinning again. 
MARK Rob Marlowe, your streak of success has finally come to an end. 
Suddenly Mark jumps and runs to his kitchen table. He grabs a pen, pulls out a sheet of paper... and begins writing. 
SERIES OF JUMP CUTS: Mark writing furiously throughout the night, piling up page upon page. By the time the sun comes up Mark is exhausted, with barely the energy to keep his head up as he writes "the end" and places the final page on his large stack of finished pages. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. LECTURE FILMS - CAR LOT - MORNING 
Mark hustles through the parking lot, manuscript in hand. He reaches the door and then stops -- remembering something. 
Mark runs to the curb and throws his manuscript onto the dirty, filthy street. He gets down on his hands and knees and rubs his manuscript into the grime, making sure to get every page equally filthy. 
Satisfied, he organizes the pages into a neat pile and enters Lecture Films. 
INT. LECTURE FILMS - WRITER'S OFFICES - DAY 
Mark walks the aisles of Lecture Films. People stop to stare at him. There is a whispered hubbub from the many cubicles and offices. 
Mark passes his old office, stopping to read the sign on the door: "14TH CENTURY -- CLOSED." 
Mark grimaces and keeps walking. 
SHELLEY (O.S.) He's gone crazy! 
Mark turns his head to see Shelley, standing down the hall, terrified, staring at Mark. 
Mark ignores her and keeps walking. Leaning against his door jamb, is Rob, smirking as Mark passes him. 
ROB Come to beg for your old job back? Hey everybody, here's the loser who thought the Black Plague would make for an interesting film. Good luck, douche bag. Freaking loser. 
Mark walks right up to the door that reads, "Head of Development -- Anthony James." 
Mark opens the door. 
Anthony is on the phone, his back to Mark. 
ANTHONY (ON PHONE) They're going to fire me any moment, I just know it. I'm really, really horrible at my job. I don't know anything about movies. I don't even like movies. I like sports. Head of development, what does that even mean? I'm not a smart person. Okay, talk to you later. 
Anthony turns around to find Mark. His face becomes very, very scared. 
ANTHONY That was the head of the studio. (PAUSE) I'm very scared that you're mad at me about the whole firing thing. 
MARK I'm not mad at all. 
Anthony is relieved. 
ANTHONY Oh good, because I feel really bad about it. I mean, I would be horrible at your job too. I would be horrible at any job in this place. (PAUSE) I love sports. 
They both stare at each other for a long beat. 
ANTHONY Why are you here? 
Mark pulls up a chair.

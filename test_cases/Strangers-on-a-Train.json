{"train": "STRANGERS ON A TRAIN \nby \nRaymond Chandler and Czenzi Ormonde \nFINAL DRAFT October 18, 1950 \nConverted to PDF by SCREENTALK FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY www.screentalk.org \nFADE IN: \nEXT. UNION STATION, WASHINGTON, D.C. DAY LONG SHOT THE CAPITOL DOME IN THE B.G. AND THE AUTOMOBILE ENTRANCE TO THE STATION IN THE F.G. LOW CAMERA \nActivity of cars and taxis arriving and discharging passengers with luggage, busy redcaps, etcetera. \nWe FOCUS on a taxi pulling up and stopping, The driver hands out modest looking luggage, including a bunch of tennis rackets in cases to a redcap. CAMERA PANS DOWN as the passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes and the lower part of his trousers. He is wearing dark colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently. The feet move toward, the entrance to the station and out of scene. Immediately a chauffeur-driven limousine drives up and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of this, and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to be wearing black and white sport shoes which, as before, are all we see of him. The sport shoes start off in the wake of the brogues. \nINT. STATION LOBBY \nCAMERA FOLLOWS the sport shoes and the brogues across the lobby into a passenger tunnel. There is the usual activity of passengers walking to and from, a loud-speaker announcing trains, etc. \nEXT. PASSENGER TUNNEL \nAs the brogues and the sport shoes emerge to the train platform, CAMERA PANS them over to the steps of the train. \nINT. TRAIN \nThe brogues and the sport shoes pass separately down the aisle, the sport shoes turning in at a compartment door and the brogues continuing toward the parlor car. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PARLOR CAR (PROCESS) \nThe brogues come to rest before a chair as the owner sits down. A moment later the sport shoes come to rest. before in adjoining chair. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 2. \nThe legs belonging to the sport shoes stretch out, and one of the shoes touches one of the brogues. \nMAN'S VOICE (over scene) Oh, excuse Me! \nCAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to SHOW two young men seated in two parlor car chairs. BRUN0 ANTHONY, the wearer of the sport shoes, is about twenty-five. He wears his expensive clothes with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always had the best. The wearer of the brogues is a fine looking but, at the moment, a somewhat troubled young man. This is GUY HAINES. He, too, is in his middle twenties and is well dressed because he can now afford to be. He nods politely, acknowledging Bruno's apology, then turns away with the gesture implying he wants privacy. \nBRUNO (smiling with sudden recognition) I beg your pardon, but aren't you Guy Haines. \nGuy nods with a polite half smile. Being a well known tournament tennis player, he has had this sort of experience before. \nBRUNO (snapping his finger) Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right off the court in South Orange last season. What a backhand! Made the semi-finals, didn't you? \nGuy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to his magazine rolled up in is fist. \nBRUNO (with open admiration) I certainly admire people who do things. (smiling and introducing himself) I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy looks up. Bruno indicates his gold tie pin which bears his name in cut- out letters. Guy looks at it with the faintest expression of disdain. I suppose you think it's corny. But my mother gave it to me so of course I wear it to please her. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                3. \nGUY (patiently)(a faint smile) How do you do. \nBRUNO (with an apologetic grin) I don't usually talk so much.   Go Ahead and read. \nGUY (wryly) Thanks. Guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of Bruno's open appraisal. \nBRUNO It must be pretty exciting to be so important. \nGUY (fidgeting slightly) A tennis player isn't so important. \nBRUNO People who do things are important. I never seem to do anything. \nNot knowing how to answer this, Guy looks a little embarrassed. \nBRUNO (still insistent on being friendly) I suppose you're going to Southampton -- for the doubles. \nGUY (politely) You are a tennis fan. \nBruno is inordinately pleased by this small tribute. \nBRUNO Wish I could see you play. But I've got to be back in Washington tomorrow. I live in Arlington, you know. \nHe has taken out a cigarette case.   Holds it out to Guy. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                      4. \nBRUNO Cigarette? \nGUY Not now, thanks.          I don't smoke much. \nBRUNO I smoke too much. \nHe fumbles for a match.          Guy brings out a lighter and hands it to Bruno. \nBRUNO Thanks. (he stares at the lighter, impressed) Elegant. \nCLOSE SHOT OF THE LIGHTER \nShowing that it has the insignia of crossed rackets embossed on it, and underneath is engraved the inscription: \"To G from A\". \nBRUNO'S VOICE (reading) To G from A. Bet I can guess who A is. \nWIDER SHOT \nGuy reacts sharply. \nGUY (coldly) Yes? \nGUY ...That's what should happen to people like you. And if I... \nHARGREAVES (interrupts) Break it up, folks. This isn't the place for a family quarrel. \nGUY (his eyes blazing) Sorry. I'm leaving. \nHe starts to exit from the booth.   Miriam grabs his arm and screams at him: \nMIRIAM (yelling like a fishwife) You heard what I said, Guy Haines. You can't throw me away like an old shoe. I'm coming to Washington to have my baby. Tell that to the senate! \nGuy strides out of the store, the manager and a few customers turning around in surprise. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              19. \nThe two customers in other booths, seeing the quarrel, open their doors simultaneously and Miriam's tirade is climaxed by a cacophony of noise, a big symphony, loud hot music, and the apparently unaware piano tuner. \nEXT. MAIN STREET METCALF SHOOTING TOWARDS STATION \nGuy is striding along angrily. He comes to the same intersection and the same cop. The officer makes a friendly gesture, is if he'd like to talk awhile, but Guy strides past him without noticing. \nEXT. METCALF STATION (PROCESS) Guy comes into the scene, crosses to a row of public telephone booths, enters one. Inside the telephone booth, he dumps some loose change on the shelf, sticks a nickel in the telephone, speaks into it. \nGUY Long distance. (a pause) I want Washington, D. C. The number is Republic 0800. Person to person. Miss Anne Burton. \nAnother pause, very long. Guy is very restless. He digs a cigarette out of his pocket and sticks it in his mouth, then looks through his pockets for his lighter, doesn't find it. He looks puzzled, but about that time the operator speaks to him. \nGUY (continuing) Right. \nGuy picks coins up off the shelf and drops them into the telephone, then waits. He shifts the receiver and fumbles in his other jacket pocket, then turns to the phone. \nGUY (tautly, into phone) Anne, -- Anne darling. Yes, I'm in Metcalf -- (gets a grip on himself) No, everything didn't go smoothly. She doesn't want a divorce, not now.... \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              20. \nINT. BURTON LIVING ROOM \nANNE BURTON is a beautiful, high-spirited and well-bred young woman. The smile on her face his faded to anxiety as she listens over the telephone which is on the desk. \nANNE (after a pause then with unpleasant realization) Another man's child! But she can't do that to you, Guy -- it's unbelievable -- it's, it's evil! (she listens, then calmly) Yes, I know how you must feel. (pause) But you sound so savage. \nBACK TO GUY IN TELEPHONE BOOTH \nGUY (furiously) Sure I sound savage. I feel savage. I'd like to break her neck! (a pause, then raising his voice) I said I'd like to break her foul, poisonous, useless little neck! (the connection is bad and he strains to hear) What's that? \nMeantime the noise of a through train has been HEARD, and the horn on a streamliner locomotive. It has come up very fast, it is now almost to the station. Guy rises his voice and yells into the telephone. His voice fights the roar of the train: \nGUY I SAID I COULD STRANGLE HER! \nThe expression on his face is frenzied and suggesting that he means exactly what he is saying. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 21. \nINT. ANTHONY LIVING ROOM \nThe scene opens on a CLOSEUP OF A MAN'S HANDS. One of them is semi-flexed and turning slowly, The other is receiving the final touches of a manicure. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that these are Bruno's hands, and that, he is studying them moodily, CAMERA PULLS BACK FARTHER to reveal his mother, MRS. ANTHONY, sitting opposite him at a little table in the Anthony living room. She is working with scissors, file and nail buffer. Mrs. Anthony is a gentle, once pretty woman, whose pastel exterior harbors a tigress-like determination to protect her son, Bruno is in his robe and is unshaven. There is evidence of long established wealth in the heavy dark appointments of this room. \nMRS. ANTHONY Since you insisted on a manicure, dear, I do wish you'd keep your hands quiet. You're so restless lately. \nBRUNO (almost dreamily as he admires the free hand) I like them to look just right. \nMrs. Anthony looks up, notices his moody expression. \nMRS. ANTHONY Did I file them too short? \nBRUNO No, Ma.   They look fine.   Thanks. \nMRS. ANTHONY Then what's the matter? \nBRUNO I'm all right, Ma.   Don't worry about me. \nMRS. ANTHONY You look so Pale, dear. Are you out of vitamins? \nBRUNO I bought a bottle of them yesterday. A whole fifth. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              22. \nMRS. ANTHONY (anxiously) But you have that 'look'. I can always tell. You haven't got into any more mischief, Bruno? \nHe denies this with a slow, solemn shake of his head. \nMRS. ANTHONY I do hope you've forgotten about that silly little plan of yours? \nBRUNO (sharply) Which one? MRS. ANTHONY (smiling) About blowing up the White House? \nBRUNO (his eyes dancing) I was only kidding, Ma. Besides, what would the president say? \nMRS. ANTHONY (laughing gaily) You're a naughty boy, Bruno. But you can always make me laugh. (she rises) Now get shaved, dear, before your father gets home. \nBruno's fist crashes down on the little table, upsetting it, as he gets to his feet. \nBRUNO I'm sick and tired of bowing and scraping to the king. \nMRS. ANTHONY (placating him) Now,    now, Let's not lose control. Come    see my painting, dear -- (she leads him toward an easel) I do    wish you'd take up painting. It's    such a soothing pastime. \nThey look at the painting. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 23. \nINSERT \nMRS. JOYCE That it is. \nWOMAN I've been reading where your son-in- law's been coming right along at tennis. \nMRS. JOYCE (sourly) We don't have any interest in tennis any more. \nThe neighbor passes on. \nCLOSE UP \nBruno, still glancing over the top of his paper. \nLONG SHOT \nAgain from Bruno's viewpoint, we see Miriam's house. At this moment the front door swings open, emitting a long streak ot bright light. We see the silhouette of a woman emerge, followed by two other men. They're laughing and joking. Suddenly they look up the street. At this very moment the bus pulls up in front of Bruno's view, cutting off the sight of his quarry. The bus comes to a stop. \nCLOSE SHOT \nBruno rises in alarm and moves around toward the end of the bus so that he shall not lose sight of the girl coming out of the house. \nSEMI-LONG SHOT \nFrom his viewpoint, the girl, whom we now see is Miriam, is running followed by the two young men. They are calling for the bus not to go - shouting, \"Hi - stop!\" Mrs. Joyce calls from the porch: \nMRS. JOYCE Don't you stay out too late, Miriam. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               28. \nMIRIAM (calling back) Goodnight, Mother.   See you later. \nCLOSE UP \nBruno watches Miriam. \nMED. SHOT \nMiriam comes nearer and nearer to Bruno. With her two companions she brushes past him and jumps onto the bus.    THE CAMERA PANS BRUNO AFTER THEM. \nEXT. AMUSEMENT PARK LONG SHOT \nWe see the bus pull up outside the Amusement Park, and the various passengers alight. These include Miriam nd her companions, and Bruno. \nLONG SHOT NEARER VIEW OF THE AMUSEMENT PARK \nWe see the usual midway with its various concessions on each side: in the distance the Ferris wheel, Merry-go-rounds, etc., and beyond that a lake. In the foreground we see people filling in and out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMED.   LONG SHOT A GROUP BY A FROZEN CUSTARD STAND \nThis group comprises Miriam and her two boy-friends. They lick their way out of the crowd and debate between themselves where to go next. \nCLOSE SHOT \nMiriam's eye catches the attention of something off screen. \nSEMI-LONG SHOT \nFrom her viewpoint we see Bruno standing and casually watching her. Other people pass around and in front of him, so that he is the only immobile figure. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 29. \nSEMI-CLOSEUP \nMiriam, with a kind of coy consciousness, turns away with the others and they go on to some other concession. \nMED. SHOT \nAs Bruno starts to advance in the direction of Miriam he is momentarily held up by a small boy in cowboy uniform carrying a gun and a balloon. The small boy points the gun at Bruno. \nSEMI-CLOSE UP The small boy pointing the gun fires it twice with a couple of 'bangs!' He then starts to move off. \nSEMI-CLOSE UP \nBruno moves on past the boy. He casually touches the balloon with his cigarette end -- it goes off with a 'pop'. \nCLOSE UP \nThe small boy turns and looks with dismay at his pricked balloon, wondering what happened. \nSEMI-CLOSE UP \nBruno moves on, pleased with himself, returning his attention to Miriam who is somewhere ahead of him. \nMEDIUM SHOT \nMiriam and her two boy-friends by the sledge hammer concession where the aim is to swing the hammer hard enough down onto its target to ring the bell and register the 100 mark. Miriam is in the foreground of the shot. The first boy steps up to try his hand. As he swings, Miriam turns and glances about her, obviously looking for Bruno. \nLONG SHOT FROM MIRIAM VIEWPOINT \nThe crowds milling, but no sign of Bruno. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 30. \nMEDIUM SHOT \nThe first boy having failed to ring the bell, the second stops up and slams the hammer down. \nCLOSE SHOT \nThe register shooting up only to the hallway mark. \nCLOSE SHOT MIRIAM \nINSIDE THE TUNNEL \nWe see the silhouettes of the occupants of Miriam's boat on the wall of the tunnel, lit dimly from the light coming from the tunnel exit. \nThe silhouette of Bruno in his boat, lit by the tunnel entrance, gradually approaches the other three. When the silhouettes are almost touching, we -- \nCUT TO: \nEXIT OF THE TUNNEL \nIt is empty. There is a sudden piercing scream from inside, followed after a second or two by protestations and giggling as Miriam's boat emerges into the light. She is pushing one of the boys away from her. \nMIRIAM (squealing) George, stop it, I tell you! \nTheir boat moves out of the picture, toward the island. Presently Bruno's boat comes smilingly following and he, too, moves on out of the picture. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 34. \nMEDIUM SHOT ISLAND \nThe group of Miriam and her companions are scrambling out of their boat and moving onto the island, one of the boys trying the boat on the shore. They disappear into the Woods of the island. \nAgain Bruno's boat comes into the picture. He steps out, lift the prow of the boat a little onto the shore. \nLONG SHOT ISLAND \nWe see the amusement park lighted beyond the lake. Silhouetted in the foreground, the trees and foliage of the island. Nearby we see the silhouetted figures of Miriam and her companions move across the scene, right to left. Miriam is pushing George away from her. \nMIRIAM (protesting perfunctorily) George, no! \nShe backs away from him and the boys go on picture. Miriam goes in another direction, around, the bushes. George obviously misses her, for we hear his voice call out: \nGEORGE'S VOICE Miriam! \nMiriam backs out of the bushes   until the back of her head is in CLOSEUP in the foreground of   the shot. Suddenly she hears steps in back of her and turns   her head toward CAMERA. Her face changes as she recognizes   someone offscene. \nMIRIAM Oh! \nShe gives a coy smile of recognition. CAMERA   PULLS BACK to reveal the mad and shoulders of Bruno between  Miriam and the camera. His hand holds Guy's lighter which he   flicks on as he raises it above Miriam's face. 0f Bruno, we  see only the back of his head and shoulders. \nBRUNO Is your name Miriam? \nMIRIAM (with surprise) Why yes. How did you -- \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 35. \nWe see Bruno's gloved hands dart quickly to Miriam's throat. The lighter falls down out of picture, and as Bruno's hands grip her throat, his head moves slightly to blot out Miriam's face. His head moves a bit farther until Miriam's face is nearly uncovered at the other side of the screen, and we see her glasses fall off. \nCLOSE SHOT \nMiriam's glasses hit the ground. The shadows of their struggling figures over the shot. \nCLOSE UP The screen is filled with one of the lenses  of the glasses. They are of the diminishing type. Against   the moonlit sky we see reflected, the elongated struggling  figures, as though we were shooting up at them. Suddenly one   of the figures falls forward. \nCLOSE UP \nMiriam's head drops into the picture by the glasses. \nBruno's hand comes into the picture and picks up the glasses. One of the lenses has been broken by Miriam's fall. \nAs we see Bruno's sport shoes move away, the CAMERA MOVES PAST MIRIAM'S HEAD until it comes to Guy's lighter pressed into the earth. \nCLOSE UP BRUNO \nBruno glances back over his shoulder.   He looks down and goes back one or two steps. \nCLOSE UP BRUNO'S HAND \nBruno's hands retrieve the lighter from the ground. \nLONG SHOT ISLAND \nWe see a full view of the island again, with the amusement park beyond. The faint noise of the calliope continues in the distance. Bruno has been lost to view. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                  36. \nMiriam's companions are still searching for her.   We hear their faint voices in the distance. \nVOICES Miriam!   Miriam! Where are you? \nMEDIUM SHOT \nBruno comes to the shore where his boat is moored. He gets in and is quickly chugging away. He moves calmly, matter-of- fact and not furtively. \nLONG SHOT LAKE Bruno's boat throbbing its way across toward the landing stage. \nMEDIUM SHOT LANDING STAGE \nThere are two boats unloading. Bruno's boat is approaching. We hear a loud call from the island. Someone has found Miriam. \nVOICES Hey, here she is! What's the matter with her? Has she fainted? \nMore shouts from the island cause the people at the landing stage to look back.  The boatman's attention is also attracted. Suddenly,  as Bruno is getting out of boat, there is a loud scream from the island. \nVOICE (crying out) She is dead! \nOTHER VOICE (from island) Help! Help! \nBruno by this time has stopped onto the landing stage, and in company with the other people, is looking back as if to see what's wrong on the island. Then he moves away, starting off of the landing stage. The boatman turns and glances at Bruno, but quickly returns his attention to the disturbance across on the island. He hurries forward and with a couple of men passengers jumps into one of the boats. He calls to his assistant as he gets into the boat. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                37. \nBOATMAN Got a cop! \nBRUNO (a little sadly) You don't seem very pleased to see me, Guy. \nGuy stands without answering. \nBRUNO (pleased again) I brought you a little present. \nGUY What do you mean? \nBruno's hand comes out of his pocket and he hands Miriam's glasses to Guy. \nINSERT \nGuy's hands taking Miriam's glasses from Bruno.    One of the lenses is broken. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                41. \nTWO SHOT \nAs Guy takes the glasses he looks at Bruno in bewilderment. \nGUY What's this all about? \nBRUNO Recognize them? \nCLOSEUP GUY \nHe looks down at the glasses, mystified.   He looks up again to Bruno. \nCLOSEUP BRUNO \nBRUNO It was very quick, Guy. She wasn't hurt in any way. It was all over in no time. \nCLOSEUP GUY \nHe is horrified. He looks swiftly down at the glasses in his hand, then back to Bruno. \nBRUNO'S VOICE (bragging) I know you'd be surprised. Nothing for us to worry about. Nobody saw me, only Miriam. \nTWO SHOT \nGuy can hardly believe what he is hearing. \nBRUNO I was very careful. Even when I dropped your lighter there, I went right back to it up. If It'd been found, it would have ruined our whole scheme, wouldn't it? \nGUY Are you trying to tell me you've -- Why, you maniac! \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org            42. \nBRUNO (looks at Guy with astonishment) But, Guy, you wanted it! We planned it on the train together, remember? \nGuy suddenly starts to go.   Bruno grabs his arm. \nBRUNO Where are you going? \nGUY Where do you think I'm going? I'm going to call the police, of course. BRUNO But you can't, Guy. We'd both be arrested for murder. \nGuy turns back slowly and faces him. \nGUY We'd both be arrested for murder? \nBRUNO You're is much in it as I am. We planned it together. Criss-cross. I do your murder -- \nGUY (suddenly angry) You crazy fool! You think you can get away with that? \nBRUNO (a little hurt) Oh, come now, Guy. Why should I go to Metcalf and kill a total stranger, unless it was part of the plan and you were in on it? You're the one that benefits, Guy. You're a free man. I didn't even know the girl. \nGuy makes a move to leave, but Bruno holds on tight. \nGUY Let me go, Bruno. I had nothing to do with this and the police will believe me. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                43. \nBRUNO (concerned) If you go to the police now, you'll just be turning yourself in as in accessory. You see, you have the motive. \nAt this moment both turn at a sound across the street. \nLONG SHOT (FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT) \nWe hear the sound of a telephone ringing in Guy's apartment. The top of one of his windows is open. BRUNO What is it? \nGUY My telephone. \nBRUNO (amused) Someone has some news for you, Guy. \nGuy still stares across the street. \nLONG SHOT (FROM HIS VIEWPOINT) \nWe see a police car pull up outside Guy's apartment. \nTWO SHOT \nBruno pulls Guy back further into the shadows. Guy instinctively flattens himself against the wall. He looks across the street again. \nLONG SHOT (FROM HIS VIEWPOINT) \nWe see the two policemen go into his apartment building. \nTWO SHOT \nGuy is still flattened against the wall to keep out of light. \nBRUNO Tell them you know about it already, Guy. \nWatching Guy closely. \nMED. SHOT \nAs Guy starts to make the long trek across the living room, with Anne behind him -- \nGUY (stiffly) Good evening, sir.   Hello, Babs. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 48. \nBarbara has been squirming in her seat, then as if jet propelled she catapults out of it and runs to Guy, giving him a big hug and a smack on the cheek. \nBARBARA Something awful has happened, Guy. \nSENATOR (firmly) Sit down, Barbara. \nSubdued, she sits down.   But Guy remains standing. \nSENATOR (finding it difficult to begin) There seems to be no way of diplomatically breaking tragic news. I'm sorry, Guy, to be the one to tell you. It concerns your wife. She's been murdered. \nGuy stares woodenly at the Senator, is if hypnotized. \nBARBARA The police have been using everything but radar to locate you. \nSENATOR You're to call Headquarters at Metcalf. \nThe full impact of what has happened hits Guy once more. \nGUY Miriam...murdered. \nANNE (with inner tension) She was...strangled. \nSlowly Guy's eyes meet hers. They are remembering what he said on the phone: \"I could strangle her.\" He sinks into a chair. The Senator is quite distressed. \nDuring the following scene Barbara quietly goes about the business of pouring drinks and serving them. She knows everyone's preference. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org      49. \nSENATOR (wrylt, to Guy) It happened on an island in an amusement park. It was sort of a lovers lane, I believe. A rather sordid atmosphere. \nBARBARA (quickly, to Guy) Miriam went there with two boys. They were the ones who found her. So they're not suspects. But you probably will be. \nSENATOR Young lady, we can't overlook the fact that murder is at our doorsteps. But I forbid you to drag it into the living room! \nBARBARA (wide-eyed) Let's not fool ourselves. The police will say Guy wanted Miriam out of the way so he could marry Anne. In a crime of this sort the police first go after the husband, and Guy had every motive. \nSENATOR (aghast) Motive? \nGUY (quietly) She's right. Whichever way you look at it...I'm in a spot. \nSENATOR (disconcerted but whistling in dark) Oh come now, my boy. I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. \nBARBARA (flatly) If he hasn't an alibi for nine-thirty tonight he has plenty to worry about. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              50. \nANNE (who hasn't taken anxious eyes off Guy) You can tell them where you were, can't you, Guy? \nGUY (wearily) At nine-thirty I was on the train from New York to Washington. \nSENATOR (relieved) There you are. BARBARA Who saw you? Did you speak to anyone? You'll need a Witness, you know. \nGUY (as if it didn't matter) Yes, I spoke to someone. \nSENATOR (hopefully) Anyone you know? \nGUY No. His name was Collins.   He is a professor. \nSENATOR (brightening) Harvard. \nGUY University of Virginia. \nThe Senator's expression says: \"Well, that's not too bad.\" \nCLOSEUP ANNE \nHer face shows her relief that Guy can account for his time. \nANNE Then everything's's all right. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org        51. \nBACK TO SCENE \nBARBARA Not quite. Detectives play a game called Motive, Motive, Who'd got the Motive. \nANNE (near the breaking point) I'm sick of hearing that word! \nBARBARA He'll still have to answer questions. SENATOR Routine.   Pure routine. \nGUY I'm afraid there'll be a lot of reporters at your front door in the morning. \nBARBARA Daddy doesn't mind a little scandal. He's a senator. \nANNE (answering Guy's look) It can't be helped, darling. It is not your fault. It's not as though anyone can say you had something to do with it. \nGUY Someone might say it...I'd do anything to keep you all out of this mess. \nSENATOR Profit by my experience, Guy. Never lose any sleep over accusations. (an afterthought) Unless they can be proved, of course. We'll help all we can. Dreadful business, dreadful. That poor unfortunate girl. \nBARBARA (flatly) She was a tramp. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              52. \nMED. SHOT \nSeated behind Guy, apart from the others who are waiting, is Professor Collins, Guy's drunken companion on the train of the night before. The professor is completely sober now, dignified and erect. He has removed his glasses to polish them and does not react to Guy's presence. \nCLOSEUP GUY \nGuy starts with a smile of recognition to say, \"How do you do?\" but at that moment he hears the door open and his name called: \nSERGEANT'S VOICE Will you come in, please, Mr. Haines? \nMED. SHOT \nGuy breaks away from his uncompleted greeting to the professor and goes through the door to Captain Turley's office, followed by the eyes of the waiting people. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              56. \nINT. CAPTAIN TURLEY'S OFFICE \nCAPTAIN TURLEY is conscientious, methodical and always polite. He puts aside photographs and records and rises from behind his desk as Guy comes in. A detective lieutenant, CAMPBELL, is attending a coffee maker. Their expressions are grave by contrast with Guy's confident attitude after seeing the professor in the waiting room. \nCAPTAIN TURLEY Good of you to be so prompt, Mr. Haines. This is Lieutenant Campbell. (the two nod to each other) Won't you sit down? GUY Thank you, sir. (he sits) \nCAPTAIN TURLEY I know you're a busy man, so   we won't detain you any longer than necessary...Now you already been good enough to tell us where you were last evening, and we've managed to locate the gentleman you spoke with on the train. \nTurley signals to Campbell to call the professor in. \nGUY (brightening) Yes. I saw him outside. \nCAMPBELL (at open door) Will you come in please, professor? \nCLOSEUP GUY \nHe looks up eagerly. \nMED. SHOT \nProfessor Collins comes in and sits in a chair opposite Guy. \nTURLEY Professor Collins, this is Mr. Haines. He was with you on the train last night. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              57. \nThe professor studies Guy for a moment, then awkwardly turns to Turley. \nCOLLINS I'm terribly sorry, but I really don't remember meeting this gentleman. \nCLOSEUP GUY \nSurprised.    His confident expression fades. \nCLOSEUP PROFESSOR COLLINS He turns from the captain to Guy. \nCOLLINS (apologetically) Unfortunately, I remember very little about the journey from New York...You see, there had been a little celebration -- \nMED. SHOT GROUP \nGuy interrupts with a slight note of impatience. \nGUY But we were sitting opposite each other in the observation car! You were singing a song about a goat -- \nCOLLINS (incredulously) A goat? \nGUY (urgently) And calculus. You were going over a speech you'd made. \nTurley and Campbell are watching closely. \nCOLLINS I was? I'm sorry, Mr. Halnes. (shakes his head) I certainly must have celebrated!   I can't remember you at all. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                58. \nCLOSEUP GUY \nMomentarily Guy is frustrated, then he turns quietly to Turley. \nGUY (calmly, logically) Captain, is it so important whether or not Professor Collins remember me? Surely, the important thing is that I've been able to name a man who was on the train with me. You've been able to find him. Isn't that proof of where I was at nine-thirty last night? Guy asks this question with a look of near triumph that he has clearly established his alibi. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BURTON LIVING ROOM EVENING \nThe Burtons are having coffee. Barbara has been glancing through a new murder mystery with a lurid cover. As Guy enters, Anne rises to greet him. \nANNE Hello, darling. Have you had your dinner? \nGUY On the train. \nANNE You weren't in Metcalf all this time? We expected you hours ago. \nBARBARA (flatly) I didn't. They sometimes throw a suspect in the can and keep him there all night. \nSENATOR (after a disapproving glance at Barbara) Sit down, Guy. Sit down.    Give him some coffee, Anne.

He didn't remember me. \nANNE But, you knew he was on the train! Wasn't that enough to prove you were on it, too? \nGuy turns his back on Bruno's figure and looks frantically toward to street, wanting to get away. \nHENNESSY -- He'd put ten men on your trail. He says -- \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 64. \nGUY (interrupts) Let's take this cab.   It's getting late. \nHe hails a taxi which is cruising by, and they start to get in.

GUY'S APARTMENT NIGHT \nAs Guy comes in from outside, there is a note on   the floor that has been pushed under the door. Guy picks    it up, stares at it for a minute before he opens it. He takes    out a handwritten note and reads it with an expression   of disgust. \nINSERT NOTE (IN GUY'S HANDS) \nIT READS: \nDear Guy: We have to meet and make plans. Call me at Arlington ----. Time's getting short.

Hennessy stands in the foreground in front of the building, on duty. \nLAP DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MELLON GALLERY \nGuy and Anne are walking slowly through a more or less deserted room of the gallery. Their manner is relaxed and intimate. \nANNE Well, we'd better be getting back. \nGUY We've actually been alone for an hour. Seems almost indecent. You like? \nANNE (softly) I like. \nGUY I was beginning to feel like a goldfish. \nANNE So was I. When we build our house, darling, we won't even have glass windows. No doorbells, no newspapers, no telephone -- \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               66. \nGUY No Hennessy. \nANNE (suddenly serious) How long can it go on? \nGUY I don't know. I suppose until they find out who did it. \nANNE We'll be happier then, won't we? \nGUY I suppose so. \nAnne looks it him, surprised at his lack of enthusiasm. They walk on out of the picture. \nA figure steps out from behind a pillar in the main hall of the gallery, near the spot from which they have disappeared. It is Bruno. He calls. \nBRUNO (softly) Guy! \nAnne stops and looks back. Guy knows who it is and would not turn but that he is forced to by Anne's action. He takes a few steps towards Bruno. \nCLOSEUP \nAnne watches Guy approach this stranger.   She looks downward at Bruno's tie pin. \nCLOSEUP \nBruno's tie pin, bearing his name, gleams in the light. \nCLOSEUP \nAnne reads the name on the tie pin. \nTWO SHOT \nGuy comes up to Bruno, steps in front of him. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                67. \nLONG SHOT \nThe mixed doubles couples complete their handshaking at the net and move off the court.

SHOT PASSAGEWAY LEADING TO TERRACE We see Guy coming alone, having fInIshed his game. He is carrying his rackets, wears a towel around his neck, etcetera. He walks into foreground, into CLOSEUP, and suddenly stops short at what he sees: \nMED. SHOT FROM GUY'S VIEWPOINT \nThe group at the table comprising Bruno, Anne and the two French people. Bruno is preening himself as the others laugh uproariously, obviously at something Bruno has said. Anne catches sight of Guy and smiles at him. \nCLOSE SHOT GUY \nCAMERA MOVES WITH HIM as he comes forward toward the table. \nMED. SHOT GROUP AT TABLE \nAs Guy comes into the scene.   He stands staring. \nANNE Guy, darling -- this is Mr. Antony -- a friend of Monsieur and Madame Darville...

Guy is forced to shake hands with him \nBRUNO I've been a fan of yours for a long time, Mr. Haines. In fact, I follow everything you do. \nMME. DARVILLE Mr. Antony has been telling us such charming stories... Very funny. \nCLOSEUP GUY \nHe gives another weak little smile. \nMED. SHOT \nIn response to the Frenchwoman's attentive and eager expression, Bruno leans forward on the table and starts saying something more in extremely fluent French. \nCLOSEUP ANNE \nShe is staring at Bruno with a new expression. \nCLOSEUP FROM ANNE'S VIEWPOINT \nBruno's coat has spread open a bit, and his tie pin bearing the name \"Bruno\" is resting on the edge of the table. \nCLOSEUP ANNE \nShe becomes aware that this is the man she has seen call to Guy in the art museum, that they have met before. Her eyes turn a little in Guy's direction, though she does not look at him. \nCLOSEUP GUY \nHe is still watching Bruno talk to the French couple. Guy is unaware of Anne's looks. Suddenly his attention is arrested by the sound of Barbara's voice calling him. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                73. \nBARBARA'S VOICE Guy! \nHe turn his head and CAMERA PANS him to Barbara, who is standing a few steps from the table beckoning to him. \nBARBARA (Sotto voce) I've just been talking to your shadow. (very impressed) Guy, did you know Mr. Hennessy helped crack that axe murder I was reading about? You know, the one where the body was cut up and hidden in the butcher shop? He was locked in the ice box with the left leg for six hours! \nGUY He pulls those yarns right out of his hat, Babs. \nCLOSEUP GUY \nHe gives a sharp look back toward Bruno. There is more laughter coming from the French couple at the table. \nCLOSE SHOT GROUP AT TABLE FROM GUY'S VIEWPOINT \nBruno is occupied with his French joke, but Anne is looking at Guy strangely. \nTWO SHOT GUY AND BARBARA \nGuy turns back to Barbara.    Barbara looks with interest toward Bruno. \nBARBARA Who's the nice looking Frenchman with the Darvilles? \nGUY He's not French.    His name's Antony. \nINT.

Even some foreign languages are being spoken. Music and chatter in the b.g. \nCLOSE SHOT \nAnne and the Senator are still greeting new arrivals. Anne's manner is somewhat preoccupied. She glances around as she speaks, as though looking for someone. \nANNE (to new arrival) Thank you so much, Mr. Lindsay. We'll look forward to it. \nPANNING SHOT FROM ANNE'S VIEWPOINT \nTHE CAMERA PASSES various groups   of guests in conversation including Guy and Barbara who are   together. From this distance we cannot hear what they   are saying. CAMERA CONTINUES TO the front door. It    opens to admit a new arrival. It is Bruno. He wears white tie    and tails, looking very elegant. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                78. \nWe see Guy excuse himself from Barbara, cross to Bruno and speak to him angrily, obviously asking, \"What are you doing here?\" Bruno, however, greets Guy with a smile then turns from him, unperturbed and bland. He sees Anne and moves toward her, smiling. \nCLOSEUP ANNE \nAs Bruno comes in her direction, Anne's expression shows her mystification and concern about Bruno's presence and about Guy's attitude toward him. \nMED. SHOT Bruno comes up to Anne and the Senator. He gives a slight bow to the Senator; then puts his hand out to Anne. \nBRUNO Good evening, Miss Burton. \nThe Senator looks inquiringly.    Anne makes the introduction. \nANNE This is Mr. Antony, father. \nSENATOR How do you do, sir. \nBRUNO I'd like to talk to you sometime, Senator, about my idea of harnessing the life force. It will make atomic power look like the horse and buggy. (the Senator and Anne are beginning to look at him in amazement) I'm already developing my faculty for seeing millions of miles. And, Senator, can you imagine being able to smell a flower on the planet of Mars? I'd like to lunch with you some day soon and tell you more about it. \nInterrupted by new arrivals, Bruno moves away out of the picture, with a charming smile to Anne. \nThe Senator greets the new guests with open mouth and simply shakes their hands while glancing off in direction of the departing Bruno. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 79. \nDOWAGER (to Senator) So nice to see you, my dear Senator. \nSENATOR Ah yes, indeed -- I beg your pardon? \nShe realizes he hasn't heard a word she's said and haughtily moves on. The Senator turns to Anne. \nSENATOR (still looking after Bruno) I don't remember inviting that young man. Who is he? ANNE A friend of the Darvilles. \nSENATOR He has an unusual personality. Provocative. \nCLOSEUP ANNE \nShe looks off in Bruno's direction extremely disturbed at this new aspect of the mysterious stranger. \nCLOSEUP GUY \nHe is watching Bruno. \nMED. SHOT \nGuy sees Bruno join a group of several ladies who are seated on a settee and a couple of older men who are standing by. A waiter comes along with a tray of drinks.

When he is convicted, he must be sentenced. When he is sentenced to death, he must be executed. \nBRUNO Quite impersonal, isn't it, sir? \nJUDGE So it is. Besides, it doesn't happen every day. \nAt this moment, Anne comes into the scene.    She hesitates as she hears Bruno's answer. \nBRUNO So few murderers are caught. \nThe Judge moves out of the way. Bruno smiles blandly at the ladies. One of them speaks to him. \nMRS. CUNNINGHAM Well, Mr. Antony, you seem very interested in the subject of murder. \nAnne looks more troubled, then moves on out of the scene. \nBRUNO No more than anyone else.   No more than you, for instance. \nMRS. CUNNINGHAM Me?   I'm not interested in murder. \nBruno pulls up a chair to face the two woman on the settee, sits down, straddling the seat, to look at them over the back of the chair and settle down for a nice conversation. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org       81. \nBRUNO (his tone is teasing) Oh, come now, everyone's interested in that.

Something funny's going on. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GUY'S APARTMENT LATER THAT NIGHT \nStill in his dinner clothes, Guy is seated in deep thought near the telephone, wrestling with his problem. There is an open telephone directory in front of him. He comes to a decision, picks up the telephone and dials a number. He waits for the answer, then: \nGUY Bruno? Yes, yes, it's Guy...I've decided to do what you want. I'll make that little visit to father.... (listens a moment) Tonight. (listens another moment) Yes, I want to get this thing over with, can you leave the house again, Bruno?

Guy presents a grim picture. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 94. \nHe is studying the plan of Bruno's house, and he picks up the key Bruno sent along with it.  Finally he looks at his watch, then folds the plan and puts it in his pocket with the key. He rises, crosses to the  chest of drawers, opens the top drawer. \nINSERT: THE OPEN DRAWER \nGuy's hands take out the Luger. His hand then picks up Miriam's glasses from the drawer, holds them a moment. He is about to put them back, then decides to take them along, puts them into his pocket. \nMED.

STEPS LONG SHOT NIGHT \nThis is a long flight of steps. Moonlit. They are lined with tall black cypress trees which throw their shadows across the steps. Guy moves out of one shadow, into another and carefully starts up the stairs. \nAT THE DOOR \nHe pauses, looks about for a moment and listens. Then he puts the key into the lock, finding it with his flashlight. The door opens a few inches. He turns off the flash, and enters. \nINT.

The heavy massive face of the dog looks straight down at him. Guy turns off the flashlight and after a moment of indecision starts slowly up the stairs once more, the dog watching every step he takes. \nUPPER HALLWAY \nHENNESSY (puzzled) Shut up. I'd better contact Metcalf. I should think this calls for more questioning of Mr. Haines. \nHAMMOND Questioning?     Nuts!   Let's take him in. \nHENNESSY My dear Mr. Hamond, how many times do I have to tell you that we have nothing conclusive on Haines? There's no evidence that he was ever at the scene of the crime. Can't you get that into your thick head? (quietly) Now stay put till I get back. \nAs he starts away -- \nFADE OUT. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              101. \nFADE IN INT. ANTONY LIVING ROOM LATE MORNING \nAnne and Mrs. Antony are in the middle of a conversation. Anne's manner is tense and purposeful, Mrs. Antony's much less serious. \nMRS. ANTONY Oh, now, Miss Burton, really! I know Bruno's been in some very awkward scrapes, but nothing so ridiculous as a murder. (she gives a short little laugh) ANNE (desperately) But, Mrs. Antony, you've got to make him do something about this. Don't you see that just one word from him would extricate Guy from this dreadful situation? \nMRS. ANTONY (lightly) Oh, but Miss Burton, I'm sure this thing must be some practical joke. You know, Bruno sometimes goes too far. (girl to girl) Of course I shouldn't be saying this to an outsider, but sometimes he's terribly irresponsible and gets into all kinds of escapades. \nANNE But don't you understand, Mrs. Antony -- your son is responsible for a woman's death. \nMRS. ANTONY (drawing herself up with some hauteur) Did Bruno tell you this? \nANNE Of course not, Mrs. Antony. \nMRS. ANTONY (that settles it) Well, there you are.

You must excuse me now. I must get back to my painting. Do you care for painting, Miss Burton? I find it so soothing. (shakes Anne's hand) You must come again sometime. \nShe goes out. Anne is left helpless, standing in the middle of the room. She picks up her purse and is about to go when she hears a voice: BRUNO'S VOICE Oh, Miss Burton! \nAnne turns back in direction of the voice. CAMERA   PULLS BACK until we can see the feet of Bruno protruding  from behind a chair in which he is sitting. He has obviously   heard the entire conversation between Anne and his mother.   Bruno rises. He is in dressing gown and pajamas. \nBRUNO I'm afraid mother wasn't very helpful, was she? (he strolls toward Anne) You know she hasn't been well for a long time. She's a little -- how shall I say -- confused. (shakes his head commiseratingly) Poor mother. \nAnne is too stunned to speak. \nBRUNO You know, I'm very upset with Guy. He shouldn't have sent you on an errand like this. \nANNE Guy doesn't know I'm here, Mr. Antony. \nBRUNO He's been leading you up the garden path, I'm afraid. He must be very desperate to try to involve me. I've been protecting him ever since we had that conversation on the train and he told me how he hated his wife. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                103. \nBruno is now standing near the   window a little apart from Anne, with his back to him. He    takes something out of the pocket of his dressing gown and   looks down at it in his hand. It is Guy's lighter.  Suddenly   he stuffs it back his pocket and turn back to Anne. \nBRUNO Why, do you know, Miss Burton, he tried to get me to go back to the island one night after dark and pick up his lighter so the police wouldn't find it? He dropped it there, you know, when -- well, that night. \nAnne's horror is growing. BRUNO The whole thing's been worrying me so much. But of course I couldn't do it, Miss Burton. It would have been too risky. And besides, it would have made me an accessory. \nAnne stares at this insane man and sinks on the settee.   She starts to cry in sheer frustration. Bruno goes to her sympathetically. \nBRUNO Miss Burton, I know how you feel. \nHe puts his hand on her shoulder. Anne flings it off. There is an awkward pause as Bruno looks down at her. Then he begins to look around restlessly. \nBRUNO Miss Burton, you must excuse me. I have an urgent appointment. (looks it his watch) I must go up and change. Now, I really must go...if you'll excuse me... \nHe turns, starts out of the room and up the stairs in the hall. Anne watches him. \nSTAIRWAY FROM ANNE'S VIEWPOINT \nBruno turns and waves to Anne from the landing, then goes on up the stairs. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                  104. \nINT.

You won't have time to play, You'd better tell them.

GUY Let's not talk about it any more. \nBRUNO (almost hopefully) Maybe she'll make more trouble for you. \nGUY I don't think so. \nBRUNO You mean you got enough on her to get your divorce no matter what? \nGUY Let's change subject, Bruno, can't we? \nBRUNO Okay, Guy. Want me to tell you one of my ideas for murdering my father? \nGUY (indicating the detective novels) You've been reading too many of these. \nBRUNO (going right on) You want to hear about the busted light socket in the bathroom, or the carbon monoxide in the garage? \nGUY No. I may be old fashioned, but I thought murder was against the law. \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org       11. \nBRUNO But not against the law of nature. My theory is that everybody is a potential murderer. Didn't you ever want to kill somebody? Say one of those useless fellows Miriam was running around with? \nGUY You can't go around killing people just because you think they're useless. \nBRUNO Oh, what's a life or two? Some people are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your -- wife and my father, for instance. It reminds me of a wonderful idea had once. I used to put myself to sleep at night -- figuring it out. Now, let's say you want to get rid of your wife. \nGUY Why? \nBRUNO Let's say she refuses to give you a divorce -- (raises a finger and stops Guy's protest) Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill her because you'd get caught. And what would trip you up? Motive. Now here's the plan... \nGUY I'm afraid I haven't time to listen. \nBRUNO (ignoring the remark) It's so simple, too. A couple of fellows meet accidentally, like you and me. No connection between them at all. Never saw each other before. Each of them has somebody he'd like to get rid of, but he can't murder the person he wants to get rid of. He'll get caught. So they swap murders. \nGUY Swap murders? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               12. \nBRUNO Each fellow does the other fellow's murder. Then there is nothing to connect them. The one who had the motive isn't there. Each fellow murders a total stranger. Like you do my murder and I do yours. \nGUY (with relief) We're coming into my station. \nBRUNO For example, your wife, my father. Criss-cross. GUY (sharply) What? \nBRUNO (with a smile) We do talk the same language -- don't we, Guy? \nGUY (preparing to leave) Sure, we talk the same language. Thanks for the lunch. \nBRUNO (beaming) I'm glad you enjoyed it. I thought the lamb chops were a little overdone myself. \nHe holds out his hand.   Guy is in a hurry but he shakes hands. \nGUY Nice meeting you, Bruno. \nBRUNO (detaining him at the door) You think my theory is okay, Guy? You like it? \nGUY Sure, sure, Bruno. They're all okay.

There are the usual counters and shelves, pianos and radios on display, and the sound of a piano being tuned in the back of the store. MIRIAM is finishing with a customer at a counter. MR. HARGREAVES, the manager, is busy at the shelves. Another girl clerk is serving a customer. In one of the glass cubicles where records are tried out, a customer is playing symphonic music; in a second glass cubicle another customer is listening to a record of popular music. A third cubicle is empty. Activity of the street is seen through the plate glass front. \nGuy walks straight to Miriam, just as she is finishing with her woman customer, handing over a small package. \nMIRIAM (taking money from customer) Even change. Thank you, Madam. (she looks up at Guy as the woman moves off) Well -- hello, Guy. \nGUY You're looking well, Miriam. \nMiriam's face is pretty because it is still young. She is self-centered and inclined to be vindictive. She wears harlequin glasses with myopic lenses which tend to make her eyes look small. \nMIRIAM So are you. You've got a nice tan, playing tennis with all your rich friends. \nGUY (ignoring the remark) What time do we meet your lawyer? \nMIRIAM (sly little smile) What's your hurry? \nConverted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 15. \nGUY My hurry? That's funny, coming from you! You're the one who's in a hurry, aren't you? \nMIRIAM (coyly) When you wouldn't give me the divorce right away, I sort of hoped it was because you were a little bit jealous. \nGUY (biting) I got over being jealous, a long time ago Miriam. Miriam's eyes slide toward the other girl clerk who has moved closer, within listening range. \nMIRIAM (indicating empty glass cubicle) Let's talk in there. \nGuy follows Miriam across to the empty room.   Miriam has brought her purse along. \nThey enter. \nINT. CUBICLE \nOnce inside, the sounds of the music playing from other parts of the shop are heard but very faintly. The piano tuning still goes on, but less stridently. Miriam and Guy are cooped together in the close quarters. \nMIRIAM (intimately) Now this is cosier. Sort of like old times, isn't it, Guy? \nGUY (coldly) Oh, skip it, Miriam. It's pretty late to start flirting with a discarded husband.

Lawyers are expensive. \nGUY (taking money from his wallet) Here it is. \nMIRIAM (taking the money greedily) If I'd known what all that tennis nonsense of yours was going to lead to, I wouldn't have run out on you. \nGUY What are you trying to say, Miriam? Come out with it. \nMIRIAM (tucking the bills away) I'm not getting a divorce. \nGUY (tense and angry) Why, you little doublecrosser. I didn't want this divorce, you did. That's what you've been harping about for the past year. \nMIRIAM It's a woman's privilege to change her mind... Now I can shop for some pretty clothes. I wouldn't want you to be ashamed of me in Washington when we go to all those dinners and swanky parties. \nGUY And what do you mean by that? \nMIRIAM (Coyly) Don't look so mad, Guy.

It's not my baby. \nMIRIAM But people don't know that, Guy, do they? It would make a pretty story, wouldn't it -- the senator's daughter involved with a married man who's about to become a father. \nGUY (furiously) You black conniving little liar! \nA few people in the shop look around as Guy's voice rises above the sound of the record playing. \nMIRIAM Keep your voice down. \nGUY What happened? Did he run out on you? \nMIRIAM No man runs out on me.   Not even you. \nGUY You're a liar and a  cheat,   Miriam.

Mr. Hargreaves, the manager, is very disturbed. \nMED. SHOT THROUGH GLASS PARTITION FROM HARGREAVES' VIEWPOINT We see Guy gripping Miriam's arms and apparently addressing her in a threatening manner, although we do not hear his words.

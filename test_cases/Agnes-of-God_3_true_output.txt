AGNES (very upset) If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... (distorted) 
MARTHA Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex... 
AGNES I can't help it if I'm stupid. 
MARTHA ... that you don't remember getting pregnant... 
AGNES Not my fault. 
MARTHA ... and that you don't believe you carried a child. 
AGNES I was a mistake. 
MARTHA What the child? 
AGNES Everything... I don't have children. 
MARTHA Agnes... 
Martha puts her arm out to Agnes who slaps it away. 
AGNES Don't touch me like that! You don't touch me like that, I know what you want from me, you want to take God away. You should be ashamed, they should lock you up people like you. 
Agnes disappears down through the trapdoor. Martha throws her cigarette away. 
46   INT - CONVENT - DAY 
Mother Miriam is comforting a tearful Agnes. She sees Martha coming across   the courtyard and pushes Agnes gently away. 
MOTHER MIRIAM You hate us don't you? 
MARTHA What? 
MOTHER MIRIAM Nuns... you hate nuns. 
MARTHA I hate ignorance and stupidity. 
MOTHER MIRIAM The Catholic Church... 
MARTHA I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church. 
MOTHER MIRIAM Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else... 
MARTHA How dare you tell me to run my affairs! 
Mother Miriam starts to walk away, Martha angrily follows her. 
MOTHER MIRIAM It's my affair too. 
MARTHA How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured... 
MOTHER MIRIAM I'm only interested... 
MARTHA ...    or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who    the hell do you think you are? You go    around here expecting applause for the    way you treated this child. 
Martha and Mother Miriam are climbing the stairs. They pause briefly. 
MOTHER MIRIAM She is not a child. 
MARTHA And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God... 
(Mother Miriams walks on) ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant... 
They reach Mother Miriam's study.

ACE WOODY Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you. Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body length from the hanging man. 
ACE WOODY See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure 'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken, everyone 'round here blames you. Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a gun and holster around his waist, he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE ina shoulder holster. He removes the big blade from its sheath. 
ACE WOODY Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty. However ... . I don't think you're gonna be able to attend. Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT... . IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from Django's face. Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade out of the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down. As he does this, he says; 
ACE WOODY Now I understand you didn't really have nuttin' to do wit it. It's that German sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted to git your girl, and hightail your nigger asses outta here. Now I appreciate that. But grieving folks 'round here need someone to blame. And I guess they figure if you hadn't brought your black ass 'round here in the first place, Boss Man still be alive. And you know what, they got a point. He THROWS the knife again... .this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django's face. He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool. As he does he says; 
ACE WOODY Now when it comes to making a nigger regret the error of his ways, believe me when I. tell you, I know every goddamn trick in the book. Now there's a lotta ass busters out there try an' git creative with the way they bust ass. But me... .I always found the best methods are, tried and true. He THROWS the knife again... Django JERKS his head back ... .and the knife LANDS in the floor, right where Django's head was. Ace Woody stands up, walks the floor to the Bowie, yanks it out of the wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down naked black man. Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his mercy. 
ACE WOODY You know Blackie, here at Candyland, I had me a real sweet deal. These last eleven years training Calvin's mandingos I made me more money I made my whole goddamn life. And no end in sight, neither. 
(BEAT) Then you came along. Knocked me right off that perch I was sittin' pretty on. You think Miss Lara gonna be as.interested in mandingos as her brother? Uuummmm...I don't think so. What I think, is you done fucked up my good thang. So when it comes to you, Django boy, you could say I gotta axe to grind. 
IJS He grabs a handfull of Django's genitals in his fist. He takes his big Bowie, and places the razor sharp BLADE against Django's nut sack. Django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole. 
ACE WOODY How's the blade of that Bowie feel against your ball sack, Blackie? A Bowie right off the wet stone. Now that's what I call sharp. Django dances some more ... 
ACE WOODY Yep nigger, I'm gonna snip them nuts. 
(BREATH) On the count of three. 
DJANGO SCREAMS: 
DJANGO 
NO!!!! 
ACE WOODY 
ONE ... 
DJANGO 
NO DON'T DO IT!!!!! 
ACE WOODY Got to do it, boy. TWO... 
DJANGO 
NO!!!! ! Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn/blacksmith facility. He's holding Django's clothes in a bundle under his arm. 
STEPHEN Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you. She wanna talk about the Old Man's funeral. Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin' Django. She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint Dickey people. While still keeping a firm grip on Django's'junk, Ace Woody says; 
ACE WOODY Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me. Ace Woody looks down at Django, both men get over the aborted emotion of what almost happened. 
ACE WOODY 
(TO DJANGO) How disappointing. 
ACE WOODY 
(TO STEPHEN) Where she at? 
STEPHEN She in the big house. The kitchen. Ace turns to leave, Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the blacksmith barn, and begins poking a LONG POKER which lies buried in the fire. Django's clothes are dumped by the furnace. 
ACE WOODY You gonna look after our friend? As, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says; 
STEPHEN Oh yes sirree Bob, you know I am! 01' Snowball and a certain naked ass upside down nigger we both know, gonna have us a big of chat. He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, it's RED HOT END 
GLOWS ORANGE. 
STEPHEN Snowballs just makin' sure his talking stick is all nice and FROSTY. Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn. Just Stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down Django, alone. With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked hanging Django. 
STEPHEN I bet you an' that German thought y'all was on easy street for awhile - didn't ya? Y'all track Hildi to the Old Man. You get the idea to go to Greenville - look up the Ole Man there. 
(BREATH) That was a good idea. I bet y'all couldn't believe how easy it was. You meet Moguy, he buys your horseshit. Ya' git your ass invited to Candyland, no fuss no muss. Ya' ride the whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser. Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking Big House. 
STEPHEN 
(BEAT) And that's where you met me. And that's when you knew your goose was cooked. He TOUCHES Django's NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker. Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture silently and stoically. This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange tip of that red hot poker.

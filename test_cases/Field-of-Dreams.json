Annie enters, putting on her coat. \nANNIE Karin, if you're finished, get your coat and school bag. Let's go. Karin bolts from the table. \nRAY Uh honey, I'll take her today. I'v-e got some errands in town. \nANNIE Far out. She takes off her coat and kisses Ray as he takes-the car keys and heads outside. Annie sits at the kitchen table. \nCONTINUED \nCONTINUED \nANNIE What if the voice calls while you're gone? \nRAY Take a message. \nANNIE Right. He exits. She grins, turns on the TV and watches Harvey. \nCUT TO \n9 EXT. IOWA CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY 9 \nRay's car pulls up, Karin runs out and Ray drives off. \nCUT TO \n10 INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY 10 \nRay is plugged into some weird-looking contraption, having his hearing examined. Then the Doctor shines a penlight into his eyes, shrugs, and starts putting his gear away. \nDOCTOR Well, I can't find anything wrong. I could recommend a shrink, but hey, people hear things all the time. I heard a voice once. I was still living with my parents, 'then. They worked in the circus, so I was raised in the circus, and I was training to be a clown. This one day, I'm putting on my little red nose and I hear a voice, tells me to go to medical school. Here I am. Ray is not sure if he should ignore this or run. \nCUT TO \n11 FARM SUPPLY STORE - DAY 11 Farmers are loading up with seed, fertilizer, and other farmer stuff. This is the kind of place where people also linger to exchange gossip, swap lies, and pass the time. Ray is off to one side, chewing the fat with an old-timer. \nCONTINUED \n11 CONTINUED 11 \nRAY In all those years, did you ever... \n(SEARCHES) I've heard that sometimes farmers out in the field...hear things. Voices. \nOLD-TIMER You hearing voices? \nRAY \n(QUICKLY) No. It's just that I heard some farmers do, and... I, of course, don't, so I was wondering if I was doing something wrong, or something. Did you ever hear voices out there? \nCASHIER (calls from her \nCASH REGISTER) Who's hearing voices? \nOLD-TIMER Ray is. Out in the fields. Now, everyone in the store turns to look at Ray. \nRAY No! No, I'm not. Really. But the people still stare. Ray addresses them. \nRAY Noises! That darn tractor, it's... (forces a nervous \nLAUGH) Well, I'll just get some 3-in-1 oil, that should... \n(TO THE \nOLD-TIMER) Nice talking to you. \nCUT TO \n12 RAY'S FARM - DAY 12 Ray is out in the fields again, hard at work. A breeze picks up. He stops fora moment, cocks an ear and looks around. All he sees are the empty fields. Insects make the only sounds. He goes back to work. Then: \nTHE VOICE 'If you build it, he will come.' \nCONTINUED \n12 CONTINUED 12 He throws his tools down angrily and looks all around, but there is no apparent source of the voice. Ray is pissed. \nRAY All right, who are you, and what the hell do you want from me?!? All he hears is a faraway echo. \nTHE VOICE 'If you build it, he will come.' This is serious. Ray shakes his head and repeats the words to himself. \n", "test1_true": "FLASH CUT \n13 A BASEBALL FIELD L3 For the briefest of moments, the dreamlike image of a baseball field at night, illuminated by floodlights, flares in over the lawn. Standing on the edge of the field, is the figure of a man with his back to us. Before we can see anything else, the image disappears. \n14 RAY 14 Ray's eyes widen. \nRAY . he will come'. \nFLASH CUT i5 THE MAN AND THE FIELD 1 5 The dream image flares in again, this time closer to the man. He stands in the middle distance, silhouetted by the lights, and we see he is wearing a uniform of some kind. He starts to turn slowly towards us, but before we can see his face, the image disappears. \n16 CLOSE ON RAY \nRay's mouth opens. He half-laughs, as if to say \"This can't be.\" But whatever is in his mind won't go away. \nRAY .he will come. \nFLASH CUT \n17 THE MAN \nNow we see him in head-and-shoulders. He has the muscular neck of an athlete. As he slowly turns we start to see a bit of his weathered face before the image flares out. \n18 RAY \nWheels are turning inside his head. He is trying to figure all this out. In the distance, a bell is ringing. He looks O.S. \n19 EXT. HOUSE - DUSK \nAnnie is on the veranda ringing the dinner bell hanging by the front door. \nANNIE Yo, Ray! Food! \n20 HER POINT OF VIEW - THE FIELDS 20 We see Ray emerge slowly from the fields, the twilit sky changing colors behind him. \n21 THE VERANDA \nAnnie leans against a post, lazily watching Ray approach. She likes how he moves, and how he looks. \nANNIE Hiya, cutie. Ray climbs up the steps, accepts her kiss, and instead of following her into the house, pulls her down with him onto the swing. He takes-her hand and looks into her eyes. \nRAY Annie... \nCONTINUED \n21 CONTINUED \nANNIE \n(PLAYING ALONG) Ray... \nRAY You're not going to believe this... \nANNIE You heard the voice again. \nRAY Wait, this gets better, I just saw a vision. \nANNIE Get out of here! \nRAY I swear to God. An actual vision. \nANNIE We're going to have to burn you at the stake if this keeps up. \nRAY I know. \nCUT TO \n22 INT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nTHE family is eating dinner. Ray seems lostin thought. \nANNIE Hey, you don't suppose this could be like an acid flashback, do you? \nRAY I never took acid. \nANNIE Maybe you will someday, and it's a flash forward. \nRAY Annie, there's more. \nANNIE You're subscribing to the Enquirer. \nRAY I think I know what 'If you build it, he will come' means. \n", "test1_id": 1500, "test2_input": "MOTEL MANAGER Well, it's funny. It's like all these memories we have of Doc had gone to sleep and sunk way down inside us. But once you started asking about him, and started us talking about him, why they swum back up to the surface again. Ray smiles. \nCUT TO \n111 MOTEL ROOM \nRay and Mann are sitting in their beds, comparing their notes. \nMANN No screwing, no drinking, no opium, no illegitimate children. No-midnight abortions, no shady finances. Ray puts down his notes and picks up the Chicago Tribune. \nRAY You sound disappointed. \nCONTINUED \n111 CONTINUED \nMANN Shoeless Joe had a problem. That's why he needed you. This guy doesn't need us. Suddenly, Ray straightens with a start. \nRAY Oh, My God. Ray hurries over to Mann, offering the opened newspaper, and points out an article to Mann. It is headlined: \nTERENCE MANN MISSING. \nMANN Damn. \n(READS) 'His son, who lives in New York City, notified police after receiving no answer to repeated telephone calls...' Shit. I'd better call him. He pulls the phone onto the bed and dials \nMANN What the hell do I tell him. \nRAY You want me to...? He motions outside with his head. \nMANN Thanks. Ray exits. \nCUT TO \n112 EXT. CHISHOLM RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 112 \nRay walks by the old movie theatre, which sits at the edge of a residential street. The Godfather is playing. He nods at an elderly man who passes him on the street. He passes a darkened house and notices there is a sign of some kind in its unlit front window. He takes another two or three steps before he has, to stop to take a better look at the sign. \n113 THE SIGN \nIt takes a second to make out the image in the dark, but it is a head shot of Richard Nixon. Above, it says \"Four More Years\". Below, it reads \"Re-Elect The President\". \n114 RAY \nis puzzled. He turns and looks at the theatre marquee. \n115 THE THEATRE MARQUEE \nUnder the letters that spell out \"The Godfather\", are smaller letters that read \"Nominated for 10 Academy Awards\". \n116 RAY \nfrowns. He says the word to himself. \nRAY Nominated? Ray now looks at the car parked nearest to him. \n117 THE CAR \nIt is an old Mustang. The annual tag on the license plate reads: 1972. \n118 ?? RAY \nLOOKS-AROUND \n119 HIS POINT OF VIEW \nAll the cars on the street are pre-1972. And still walking down the block away from him, is the elderly man Ray passed moments earlier. The man is about sixty-five years old, stooped a little, but the body is still lithe, an athlete's body. He is wearing a dark overcoat... \n120 CLOSER POINT OF VIEW \n.and he carries an umbrella. \n121 RAY 121 The little hairs on the back of Ray's neck stand up. His mouth is dry, and for a moment, he cannot speak. Then, he calls to the man. \nRAY Doctor Graham? Slowly, the man stops and turns back to face Ray. Ray starts to trot to him. \nELDERLY MAN Who's that? \nRAY My name is Ray Kinsella. I'm from Iowa. Are you Moonlight Graham? The old man narrows his bright eyes to see Ray more clearly. \nDOC GRAHAM No one's called me 'Moonlight' Graham for fifty years. \n", "test2_true": "(SMILES TO \nHIMSELF) . a very long way to see you. \nDOC GRAHAM Funny. I couldn't sleep tonight. Usually, I sleep like a baby. So I told Alicia I was going to take a walk. \nRAY Mind if i join you? I'd like to talk to you. Doc nods and they start to walk. \nDOC GRAHAM Let's go to the high school. We can sit in my office. What do. you want to talk about? \nRAY Well, first of all, how'd you get to be called 'Moonlight'? \nDOC GRAHAM 'Cause of a night like this, long ago. I'd just gotten to the minors, and I went out to the ballpark. \n(MORE) \nCONTINUED \n121 CONTINUED DOC GRAHAM (Cont'd} There's nothing as peaceful as a ballpark at night. Like a church. \nRAY Yeah, I know what you mean. \nDOC GRAHAM Anyway, I fell asleep. Next morning, they found me in the on-deck circle, all curled up like a baby. Someone called me 'Moonlight,' and it stuck. \n122 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL 122 \nDoc fumbles out a key, and lets them in. \nRAY When you got to the majors, you played only one inning of one game. What happened in that inning? \n123 INT. HIGH SCHOOL 123 \nThey enter the hallway of the old school, the smell of varnish and chalk almost palpable. \nDOC GRAHAM It was the last day of the season. Bottom of the eighth, and we were way ahead. I'd been up with the club for most of a month, but hadn't seen any action. Just then old John McGraw points a bony finger at me and says 'Right field.' Well sir, I jumped up like I was sitting on a spring, grabbed my glove, and ran out onto the field. They reach a varnished door with an opaque glass inset, and enter. Doc Graham's office. \n124 INT.,DOC GRAHAM'S OFFICE 124 \nDoc seats himself behind a cluttered desk, and motions Ray to the black-leather sofa a few feet away. \nRAY Did you get to make a play? Doc takes a sheet of paper off his desk, expertly rips an inch or so off the corner with his teeth, and begins chewing. \nCONTINUED \n124 CONTINUED 124 \nDOC GRAHAM Nope. They never hit the ball out of the infield. Ray chuckles, but then flinches as Doc shoots his little spitball towards him. \nDOC GRAHAM Heads up. It hits the back of the sofa a few feet from Ray, and hangs there, like a white fly. \nRAY I was warned about you. \nDOC GRAHAM Anyway, one inning later the game was over, and so was I. \nRAY And what was that like? \nDOC GRAHAM It was like coming this close to your dreams, and then watching them brush past you like a stranger in a crowd. Ray nods, and a look of understanding begins to appear on his face. He looks out the window, focused on faraway. \nDOC GRAHAM Except, at the time, you don't think much of it. Hardly anybody recognizes the most significant moment of their life when they're happening. Back then I just figured there'd be plenty more days. I didn't know that would be the only one. Doc Graham notices that Ray is looking very serious. \nDOC GRAHAM Now, let me ask you a question, Ray Kinsella. What makes that half-inning so interesting that you come all the way from Iowa to ask me about it sixty-five years later? Ray chooses his words carefully. \nCONTINUED \n124 CONTINUED (2) 124 \nRAY I didn't really know till just now. But I think it's to ask you if you could do anything you wanted to...if you could have a wish... \nDOC GRAHAM Ahh... Doc nods. his understanding. He smiles wryly, takes a new piece of paper, and bites off a little section. \nDOC GRAHAM And are you the kind of man who could grant me that wish? \nRAY I don't know. I'm just asking... Doc leans his left elbow on the desk and rubs his forehead thoughtfully with a palm, as if it were an eraser that could erase the years and take him back to 1929 and the Polo Grounds in New York. \nDOC GRAHAM I never got to bat in the major leagues. I'd have liked the chance -- just once -- to stare down a big league pitcher. Stare him down and then just as he goes into the windup -- wink! Make him wonder if I know something he doesn't. That's what I wish for. The chance to squint my eyes when the sky is so blue it hurts to look at it, and to feel the 'tingle that runs up your arms when you connect dead-on. The chance to run the bases, stretch a double to a triple, and flop race-first into third, wrapping my arm around the bag. That's my wish, Ray Kinsella... that's my wish. Ray begins to smile. Graham is staring intently at him. \nDOC GRAHAM Is there enough magic floating around in the night out there for you to make that wish come true? \nRAY What would you do if I said 'Yes'? \nDOC GRAHAM I think I might actually believe you. \n", "test2_id": 1501, "test3_input": "RAY No deal, Mark. We're staying. \nKARIN We don't have to go. \nMARK \n(EXPLODES) You're virtually bankrupt, and I'm offering you a way to keep your home because I love my sister! I've got partners who don't give a damn about you, and they're ready to foreclose right now! \nKARIN Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm. \nMARK Karin, please! \nRAY Wait. They all turn to Karin. \nKARIN People will come. \nRAY What people, sweetheart? \nCONTINUED \n137 CONTINUED (3) \nKARIN From all over. They'll just decide to take a vacation, see, and they'll come to Iowa City, and they'll think it's really boring, so they'll take a drive. And they'll drive down our road, and they'll see the lights and they'll think it's really pretty. Ray, Annie, and Mann listen with wonder, to this vision. \nKARIN So, the people in the cars? They'll drive up and they'll want to pay us, like buying a ticket. Mark looks at them all as if they're crazy. \nMARK You're not listening to this seriously, are you? \nANNIE Yes. \nMARK Why would anybody pay money to come here? Karin looks at her Uncle mark as if he were a simpleton. \nKARIN To watch the game. And it'll be just like when they were little kids a long time ago, and it was summertime, and they'll watch the game and .remember what it was like. Ray and Annie couldn't be prouder of their daughter than they are right now. \nMARK What the hell is she talking about? \nANNIE She's talking about people seeing their memories... touching their past. \nRAY \n(NODS) People will come. \nCONTINUED \n137 CONTINUED (4) \nANNIE It'll be like one of those tiny, French restaurants that have no sign. You find it by instinct. They'll be drawn. \nMARK Okay, this is all fascinating, but the fact remains that you don't have the money to bring the mortgage up to date, so you still have to sell. I'm sorry, but you have no choice. He produces a document and hands it to Ray with a pen. Ray looks at it. He doesn't know what to do. \nMANN Ray... Ray looks at Mann. \n138 MANN \nspeaks now as he has not spoken for many years: as Terence Mann, master of words, spellbinder. \nMANN People will come, Ray. They'll come to Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom. They'll turn up your driveway, not knowing for sure why they're doing it, and arrive at your door, innocent as children, longing for the past. 'Of course we won't mind if you look around,' you'll say. 'It's only twenty dollars per person.' And they'll pass over the money without even looking at it. For it is money they have, and peace they lack. \n139 MARK \npushes the papers. forward. \nMARK Just sign the papers, Ray. \n140 MANN \nis not one to give up. \nCONTINUED \n140 CONTINUED \nMANN They'll walk out to the bleachers and sit in shirtsleeves in the perfect evening, or they'll find they have reserved seats somewhere in the grandstand or along one of the baselines -- wherever they sat when they were children and cheered their heroes. They'll watch the game, and it will be as if they'd dipped themselves in magic waters. The memories will be so thick they'll have to brush them away from their faces. \n141 MASTER \nSpellbound, Ray has put the papers down. Mark picks them up again. He is battling Mann for Ray's attention. \nMARK Listen to me. Tomorrow morning, when the bank opens, they will foreclose. \nMANN People will come, Ray. \n", "test3_true": "MANN The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America has rolled by like an`army of steamrollers. It's been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field, this \u00b0 game... it's a piece of our past. It reminds us of all that once was good. And that could be again. People will come. People will most definitely come. Mann has moved everyone (but Mark) with the beauty of his words, and the passion in his.voice. Behind him, the assembled ballplayers respectfully applaud. \nBUCK WEAVER \n(TEARY-EYED) That was beautiful... The other players nod, also teary-eyed. \nCONTINUED \n141 CONTINUED 141 \nBUCK WEAVER \n(SINCERELY) .fuckin' beautiful. The players on either side of him jab his ribs with their elbows, but Mann, Ray and Annie laugh with pleasure. \nMARK Ray. You will lose everything and you will be evicted. Ray looks at the paper with dread. He looks at Shoeless Joe and the players. He looks at his family. Then he turns back to Mark. It's decision time. \nRAY I'm not signing. Mark shakes his head sadly. Annie hugs Ray. The players breathe a great sigh of relief. Mann smiles. \nMANN Ray... Ray looks up at Mann, who, with a gentle tilt of the head, directs Ray's attention to the house. Ray looks behind him toward the house. \n142 RAY'S POINT OF VIEW - CARS 142 have parked in front of the house. More are coming quietly down the driveway. Dozens of cars. Cars with out-of-state license plates. Some people,have gotten out of their cars and wait patiently. One or two families sit on their hoods, or have set up picnic dinners on their station wagons' tailgates. \n143 THE BLEACHERS 143 Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are deeply happy -- but not terribly surprised -- to see these people. \nRAY \n(SING-SONG) They're he-re. Mark looks at the house and then back at Ray. \nNARK Who's here? \nCONTINUED \n143 CONTINUED \nRAY (with an edge) You don't see those cars? All those people? \nMARK Don't do this, you son of a bitch! There's no cars, no people... \nKARIN Uncle Mark, I can see them. \nANNIE We all can. \nMARK You're crazy. You're all bat-shit crazy! \nRAY Watch your language, Mark. \nMARK You build a baseball field in the middle of nowhere, you sit around here and stare at nothing --- \nKARIN It's not nothing. Mark grabs Karin's arm and pulls her to her feet as if she were \"Exhibit A.\" \nMARK And you've turned your daughter into a goddamn moron! \nRAY Get your hands off her. Ray rises threateningly, and Mark turns toward him. In so doing, he twists little Karin off balance. \nMARK I'm trying to help you, goddamnit! In that split second, they hear a strangled gasp, and see Karin falling forward from the top row of the bleachers. \nRA Y Karin!! \n144 KARIN \nHer hot dog flies off, the bun and wiener separating in midair. One small sandal bounces end over end and lands at the foot of the bleacher. It takes forever for her body to come down with a sickening thud on the hard green boards of one of the bottom rows. \n145 THE OTHERS \nrush down to where she lies, face up. Ray is first, but he does not know what to do. Annie and Mann hover. Mark is horror-stricken, but no one knows what to do. \nMARK Oh my God, I'm sorry...Annie...I didn't mean to... Karin is unconscious, and seems to be fighting for breath. Ray and Annie's eyes meet in anguish. \nANNIE Should we move her? \nRAY Get the car. \n146 ANNIE \nsprings for the house. The tourists by their cars watch quietly. \nANNIE Is there a doctor? A nurse? Any of you? They sadly shake their heads no. Annie races inside. \n147 BACK AT THE BLEACHERS \nMost of the White Sox players stand by the left field fence, staring silently. \n", "test3_id": 1502}

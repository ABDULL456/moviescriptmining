{"train": "FIELD OF DREAMS \nWritten by \nPhil Alden Robinson \nMarch 9, 1988 \nFINAL DRAFT SCREENPLAY \nFADE IN \nMONTAGE OF PHOTOS \nRAY (V.O.) My father\u0092s name was John Kinsella. A faded, sepia shot of a dirty little kid on a farm. \nRAY (V.O.) It\u0092s an Irish name. He was born in North Dakota, in 1896... Young man in doughboy uniform. \nRAY (V.O.) ...and never saw a big city until he came back from France in 1918. Chicago. Tenement. Comiskey Park. Ballgames. \nRAY (V.O.) He settled in Chicago, where he quickly learned to live and die with the White Sox. Died a little when they lost the 1919 World Series... Newspaper headlines. Photo of Shoeless Joe Jackson. \nRAY (V.O.) ...died a lot the following summer when eight members of the team were accused of throwing that Series. Dad (a catcher) playing ball. At work. Weeding. \nRAY (V.O.) He played in the minors for a year or two, but nothing ever came of it. Moved to Brooklyn in \u009235, married Mom in \u009238, and was already an old man working at the Naval Yards when I was born in 1949. Ray as an infant. With his father. In front of Ebbets Field in miniature Dodger uniform, etc. \nRAY (V.O.) My name\u0092s Ray Kinsella. Mom died when I was three, and I suppose Dad did the best he could. Instead of Mother Goose, I was put to bed at night to stories of \n(MORE) \nCONTINUED \n1 CONTINUED \nRAY (CONT'D) Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig...and the great Shoeless Joe Jackson. Dad was a Yankees fan then, so of course I rooted for Brooklyn. But in '58 the Dodgers moved away, so we had to find other things to fight about. We did. And when it came time to go to college, I picked the farthest one from home I could find. Berkeley in the 1960s: hippies, protesters, etc. \nRAY (V.0.) This, of course, drove him right up the wail, which I suppose was the point. Officially my major was English, but really it was the Sixties. Ray looking foolish in long hair and tie-dye. \nRAY (V.O.) I marched, I smoked some grass, I tried to like sitar music... and I met Annie. Annie: blue jeans, T-shirt, freckles. Their courtship. \nRAY (V.0.) The only thing we had in common was that she came from Iowa and I had once heard of Iowa. We moved in together. After graduation, we moved to the Midwest, and stayed with her family as long as we could. Unsmiling American Gothic types. \nRAY (V.O.) Almost a full afternoon. The apartment, Ray at different jobs, the wedding. \nRAY (V.0.) We rented an apartment and I took a job selling insurance. I also drove a cab and worked in a pizza parlor. Dad died in June of 1 74. Annie and I got married that fail. Baby pictures. \nRAY (V.O.) A few years later Karin was born. She smelled weird, but we loved her anyway. Then Annie got the crazy idea that she could talk me into buying a farm. \nCONTINUED \n1 CONTINUED (2) \nRay, Annie, and four-year-old Karin by the \"SOLD\" sign of their farm. Ray in a cornfield. \nRAY (V.0.) I'm thirty-eight years old and I'm about to become a farmer. I love my family, I love baseball, and I miss New York. Moving in on Ray's face. \nRAY (V.0.) But until I heard The Voice...I'd never done a crazy thing in my whole life. \nDISSOLVE TO \n2 THE CORNFIELD - DUSK \nIt is dusk on a spring evening. The sky is a robin's-egg blue, and the wind is soft as a day-old chick. Ray Kinsella is working in the cornfield when a voice -- like that of a public address announcer -- speaks to him. \nTHE VOICE 'If you build it, he will come.' Ray looks up and around, but sees nothing that could be the source of this sound. All around him are empty fields. He stands quietly for a few moments, then goes back to work. \nTHE VOICE 'If you build it, he will come.' Ray jerks his head in all directions to see where this voice is coming from, but again, he sees nothing unusual -- just the furrowed fields and a few hundred feet away, the massive old farmhouse with a sagging veranda on three sides. On the north veranda is a wooden porch swing where Annie and Karin sit, sipping lemonade and dreaming. \nRAY \n(CALLS) Annie, what was that? \nANNIE \n(CALLS BACK) What was what? \nRAY That voice. \nANNIE What voice? \nCONTINUED \nKARIN Why'd you do that? It was funny. \nRAY Trust me, Karin, it's not funny. The man is sick. He's very sick. Annie enters, putting on her coat. \nANNIE Karin, if you're finished, get your coat and school bag. Let's go. Karin bolts from the table. \nRAY Uh honey, I'll take her today. I'v-e got some errands in town. \nANNIE Far out. She takes off her coat and kisses Ray as he takes-the car keys and heads outside. Annie sits at the kitchen table. \nCONTINUED \nCONTINUED \nANNIE What if the voice calls while you're gone? \nRAY Take a message. \nANNIE Right. He exits. She grins, turns on the TV and watches Harvey. \nCUT TO \n9 EXT. IOWA CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY 9 \nRay's car pulls up, Karin runs out and Ray drives off. \nCUT TO \n10 INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY 10 \nRay is plugged into some weird-looking contraption, having his hearing examined. Then the Doctor shines a penlight into his eyes, shrugs, and starts putting his gear away. \nDOCTOR Well, I can't find anything wrong. I could recommend a shrink, but hey, people hear things all the time. I heard a voice once. I was still living with my parents, 'then. They worked in the circus, so I was raised in the circus, and I was training to be a clown. This one day, I'm putting on my little red nose and I hear a voice, tells me to go to medical school. Here I am. Ray is not sure if he should ignore this or run. \nCUT TO \n11 FARM SUPPLY STORE - DAY 11 Farmers are loading up with seed, fertilizer, and other farmer stuff. This is the kind of place where people also linger to exchange gossip, swap lies, and pass the time. Ray is off to one side, chewing the fat with an old-timer. \nCONTINUED \n11 CONTINUED 11 \nRAY In all those years, did you ever... \n(SEARCHES) I've heard that sometimes farmers out in the field...hear things. Voices. \nOLD-TIMER You hearing voices? \nRAY \n(QUICKLY) No. It's just that I heard some farmers do, and... I, of course, don't, so I was wondering if I was doing something wrong, or something. Did you ever hear voices out there? \nCASHIER (calls from her \nCASH REGISTER) Who's hearing voices? \nOLD-TIMER Ray is. Out in the fields. Now, everyone in the store turns to look at Ray. \nRAY No! No, I'm not. Really. But the people still stare. Ray addresses them. \nRAY Noises! That darn tractor, it's... (forces a nervous \nLAUGH) Well, I'll just get some 3-in-1 oil, that should... \n(TO THE \nOLD-TIMER) Nice talking to you. \nCUT TO \n12 RAY'S FARM - DAY 12 Ray is out in the fields again, hard at work. A breeze picks up. He stops fora moment, cocks an ear and looks around. All he sees are the empty fields. Insects make the only sounds. He goes back to work. Then: \nTHE VOICE 'If you build it, he will come.' \nCONTINUED \n12 CONTINUED 12 He throws his tools down angrily and looks all around, but there is no apparent source of the voice. Ray is pissed. \nRAY All right, who are you, and what the hell do you want from me?!? All he hears is a faraway echo. \nTHE VOICE 'If you build it, he will come.' This is serious. Ray shakes his head and repeats the words to himself. \nCONTINUED \n22 CONTINUED \nANNIE Oooh, why do I not think this is a good thing? \nRAY I think it means if I build a baseball field out there, Shoeless Joe Jackson will get to come back and play ball again. \nANNIE You're kidding. \nRAY Uh uh. She whistles. This is serious. \nRAY Yeah. \nCUT TO \n23 INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRay and Annie are putting little Karin to bed. \nANNIE Boy, I thought my family was crazy, but this...this is the craziest thing I've ever heard. \nRAY I know. It's totally nuts. \nANNIE I mean, Shoeless Joe, he's... \nRAY \n(NODS) Died in '51. \nANNIE And he's the one they suspended, right? \n-AY Right. \nANNIE He still dead? \nRAY Far as I know. \nCUT TO \n24 INT.'BATHROOM - NIGHT \nRay and Annie in their pajamas, brushing their teeth, getting ready for bed. \nANNIE You know what amazes me? No one could ever get you to believe in astrology, or ESP, or reincarnation, or heaven, or any of that stuff. But this...I think this shows real personal growth, Ray. \nRAY Thank you. Annie smiles, but sees that Ray is troubled. She hugs him. \nANNIE Oh, sweetie. I hope you know that even though I make jokes, I'm going to visit you every month wherever they put you. He offers her a weak smile and exits. \nCUT TO \n25 INT. RAY AND'ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nIt is dark. For a few seconds it is quiet. Then: \nRAY Did you know Babe Ruth copied his swing? \nANNIE If I did, I'd forgotten it. Ray sits up in the dark. \nRAY I always felt cheated I never got to see him play. He was supposed to be so graceful, and agile. So to actually get to see him play again...to let him play again, to right an old wrong... He shakes his head in wonder just to think of it. Annie turns on the light. \nANNIE Wait a minute, Bosco. Are you actually thinking of doing this? \nCONTINUED \n25 CONTINUED \nRAY No. \n(THEN) I mean, I can't think of one good reason why I should,-but... (takes a breath) I'm thirty-eight years old, I have a wife, a child, and a mortgage, and I'm scared to death I'm turning into my father. \nANNIE What's your father got to do with this? Ray tries to picture his father in his mind. He speaks softly, but the words obviously have a great deal of meaning for him. \nRAY I never forgave him for getting old. By the time he'was as old as I am now, he was ancient. He must have had dreams, but he never did anything about them. For all I know, he may have even heard voices, too, but he sure didn't listen to them. The man never did one spontaneous thing in all the years I knew him. Annie, I'm scared that that's what growing up means. I'm afraid of that happening to me. And something tells me this may be my last chance to do something about it. (looks at her) I want to build that field. Do you think I'm crazy? She looks at him with great understanding. \nANNIE Yes. He smiles wanly. She touches his face lovingly. \nANNIE I also think that if you feel you really have to do this... then you should do it. They hold each other's gaze, and Ray cannot remember when he has loved her so much. He takes her in his arms. Outside their window, the field of corn lies waiting. \nCUT TO \nKARIN What's suspend? \nRAY They never let him play the game again. They continue to work in silence. \nCUT TO \n37 INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE I 7 \nRay writes a check for his purchases: bats, balls, bases pitcher's rubber, home plate, etc. He appears slightly annoyed that once again, he is being stared at by all the uniformed employees of the store. He turns to catch the Store Owner staring at him the most intently. \nRAY What. What! \nSTORE OWNER You're the fella that plowed under your corn and built a baseball diamond, right? \nRAY Yeah. What about it? \nSTORE OWNER (shakes his hand) Greatest damn thing I ever heard. The other employees beam their agreement. \nRAY At these prices, I'm not surprised. \nCONTINUED \n37 CONTINUED He wheels his shopping cart of sporting goods out through a gauntlet of approving salesmen. They smile and pat him on the back. Ray cannot decide if they're crazier than he is. \nRAY Thank you...thank you... \nCUT TO \n38 THE LIGHT STANDARD - NIGHT 38 Atop the aluminum-painted poles, an array of store-bought floodlights switch on, flaring against the blue-black sky. In this sharp white light the grass glows parrot green, cool as mint, soft as a cashmere blanket. Annie and Karin watch as Ray puts down the clean white bases, which pick up the light like little moons on a cold, clear night. \nRAY My father said he saw him years later playing under a made-up name in some tenth-rate league in Carolina. He'd put on fifty pounds, and the spring was gone from his step, but he could still hit. Dad used to say no one could hit like Shoeless Joe. Ray is smiling wistfully. \nANNIE That's the first time I've ever seen you smile as you mentioned your father. Ray considers that. \nKARIN How come? \nANNIE Come on, you. Bed time. Annie hoists Karin on her shoulders with a grunt, and the three climb their way down the bleachers. Ray's hand steadies Annie as she takes one of the steps. \nRAY Careful... Moonl ight butters the Iowa night. They walk along the side of the field, and Ray stops. He looks at the field. \nCONTINUED \n38 CONTINUED 38 \nRAY I have just created something totally illogical. \nANNIE That's what I like about it. \nRAY Am I completely nuts? \nANNIE Not completely. She looks out over the baseball field. \nANNIE It's a good baseball field, Ray. \nRAY It is kinda pretty, isn't it? Annie smiles at him and carries Karin inside. Ray steps onto the porch and flicks the switch shutting off the floodlights over the field. \nCUT TO \n39 RAY AND ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 39 Annie opens her eyes and sees Ray not beside her in bed, but in th window seat, looking out at the empty field. Barely awake, she gets out of bed, shuffles to his side and curls up against him. \nANNIE Any sign? \nRAY Something's going to happen out there. I can feel it. Annie lowers her head against his chest and goes back to sleep. Outside, the trees are fully leafed. \nDISSOLVE TO \n40 RAY'S BASEBALL FIELD - OCTOBER 40 The trees are almost bare now, and there's a Halloween pumpkin in the front window of the house. The cornstalks \nCONTINUED \n40 CONTINUED \n,rustle like crumpling paper in the Indian-summer breeze which blows fallen leaves across the empty baseball field while Ray sits in the stands... waiting. \nDISSOLVE TO \n41 THE BASEBALL FIELD - LATE DECEMBER 41 it is covered with snow. \n42 INT. RAY AND ANNIE'S HOUSE 42 \nRay looks forlornly out the living room window towards his snow-covered baseball field, the merrily blinking lights of the Christmas tree behind him belying his true mood. \n(MORE) \nCONTINUED \n59 CONTINUED \nMARK (CONT'D) give you a more than a fair price and you walk away with a nest egg. \nRAY Thanks, Mark, but no. \nMARK What are you holding on to this place for? You've never even liked Iowa. You don't like farming, you don't know the first thing about it --- \nRAY Hey; I know a lot more about farming than you think. \nMARK How could you plow under your major crop? \nRAY \n(TO ANNIE) What's a crop? Karin enters breathlessly. \nKARIN Daddy, the baseball game is on. Ray beams. Karin returns the smile and reaches her arms out to be picked up. She scissors her legs around her father at belt level, hugging his neck. \nRAY Excuse us. He exits, carrying Karin. Mark shakes his head. \nMARK I don't believe this guy. I'm trying to bail him out and he goes off to watch television. Annie stifles a laugh. \nMARK He used to be so normal. \nMOTHER Does he beat you? \nANNIE What??? \nCONTINUED \n59 CONTINUED (2) \nMARK He's drinking, right? \nANNIE He doesn't drink, and he doesn't beat me, okay? Now I'll grant you, he has gotten me to worship Satan with him, but just a little. Her mother gasps. \nANNIE Kidding... I'm kidding! Her family has no sense of humor about this whatsoever. \nANNIE I think we need more cheese. She goes into the kitchen, and when she has rounded the corner, she raises her eyes to heaven and mutters: \nANNIE Families. \n60 THE FIELD 6 0 Karin and Ray sit on the bleachers, eating peanuts while Shoeless Joe and his seven teammates practice. (Three, including Shoeless Joe, are in the outfield, two more in the infield, one pitches, one catches, and one bats.) The men are all in their twenties or thirties, but show the sheer enjoyment of returning after an absence of sixty-five years to the game they love. Ray directs Karin's attention to the left fielder. \nRAY Watch Joe. Watch his feet as the pitcher gets the sign and starts to pitch. A good left fielder knows what pitch is coming, and he can tell from the.angle of the bat where the ball's going to be hit. At the sharp crack of the bat Shoeless Joe whirls, takes five loping strides toward the fence, turns again', reaches up, and the ball smacks into his glove. Karin cheers. One of the players good-naturedly boos. \nHAPPY FELSCH Showoff! \nCONTINUED \n60 CONTINUED \nBUCK WEAVER Aw, stick it in your ear, Felsch. \nEDDIE CICOTTE Yeah, if you'd run like that against Detroit I'da won twenty games that year. \nHAPPY FELSCH Oh for Pete's sake, that was sixty-five years ago! Give it up, will ya... \nSWEDE RISBERG Hey., you guys wanna play ball, or what? \nHAPPY FELSCH .you muscle-bound jerk. \nEDDIE CICOTTE Oh yeah? At least I got muscles. \nHAPPY FELSCH No. At most you got muscles. \nBUCK WEAVER Come on, asshole, pitch! The good-natured banter stops short, and the other players glare at Weaver who looks sheepishly toward the little girl and her father in the bleachers. \nBUCK WEAVER Sorry, kid. \nKARIN It's okay! \nPLAYERS All right,'Karin! The players resume their practicing and ribbing. \n61 EXT. HOUSE \nAnnie emerges with-her Mother, Mark and Dee, walking toward the bleachers where Karin and Ray are still watching the spirited practice. \n(TO RAY) See you later, Ray. \nRAY Right. See you guys. The players call their \"good-byes\" to Ray and head for the door in the outfield fence. Ray watches them fade out as they go through the door. Then he takes a moment to look around him. The baseball diamond set in the cornfield is quite beautiful. Ray takes a satisfied breath, and walks back toward his house. He is the very picture of contentment. Then he hears The Voice. \nTHE VOICE 'Ease his pain.' Ray stops short. \nRAY What? No response. \nCONTINUED \n62 CONTINUED (2) \nRAY I'm sorry. I didn't understand. \nTHE VOICE 'Ease his pain.' Ray stops short. \nRAY What? No response. \nRAY I'm sorry. I didn't understand. \nTHE VOICE 'Ease his pain.' \nRAY Whose pain? What pain? No response. \nRAY Why me? But there is no response. \n63 INT. HOUSE \nRay enters as Annie and Karin are putting dinner on the table. Ray plops- into his chair at the head of the table. \nANNIE Come on, wash up. We've got a PTA meeting after dinner. They're talking about banning books again. Really subversive books like, Wizard of Oz, Diary of Anne Frank --- She notices Ray is strangely silent. \nANNIE What happened to you? \nPAY The Voice is back. \nANNIE Oh Lord, you don't have to build a football field now, do you? \nCONTINUED \n63 CONTINUED\" \nRAY (shakes head no) He said...'Ease his pain.' \nANNIE Ease whose pain? \nRAY I asked him. He wouldn't tell me. \nANNIE Shoeless Joe's? \nRAY I don't think so. \nANNIE One of the other players? \nRAY I don't think so. \nANNIE This is a very non-specific voice you've got out there, Ray, and he's really starting to piss me off. Ray nods as Annie serves the meal in silence. \nCUT TO \nEXT. IOWA CITY PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT 64 \nParents stream in past the \"PTA Meeting Tonite\" sign. Ray and Annie stand by the doorway, talking with Miss Corser, Karin's teacher. (Ray is too distracted by his own thoughts to pay this much attention.) \nMISS CORSER Karin has such a wonderful imagination. Lately, she's been making up these charming little stories about ghosts who play baseball in a cornfield... wonderful imagination. \nANNIE \n(WITH A \nMYSTERIOUS \nSMILE) Yes. She gets that from Ray. Miss Corser smiles approvingly. Ray realizes both women are looking at him, now, and he emerges from his thoughts. \nCONTINUED \n64 CONTINUED \nRAY Hmm? Annie leads Ray inside. \n65 INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY - NIGHT \n65 CONTINUED (3) \nANNIE (CONT'D) here? Who wants to burn books? Who wants to piss on the Constitution of the United Sates? Anybody? The majority who had sided with the book-banner wants to vote for censorship, but under these terms just can't raise their arms. Little Annie is on a roll, now. \nANNIE All right. Now: who's for The Bill of Rights? Come on...who thinks freedom's a pretty good thing? Let's see those hands. Some people start raising their hands. \nANNIE Who thinks we have to stand up to the kind of censorship they have in Russia? Reluctantly, just about everyone raises their hands. Annie is thrilled. \nANNIE There you go. All right, America! I'm proud of you. I mean it. You're beautiful! \nRAY \n(RISING) Annie, we gotta go. \nANNIE (to the crowd) We gotta go. Ray pulls her from the room. Each is proud as hell, each for a different reason. \n66 EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT \nas they burst out, bubbling over with their enthusiasm. \nANNIE Oh Ray, was that great, or what? it was like the Sixties again. \nRAY I figured it out. \nANNIE \n(RELIVING IT) 'Step outside, you Nazi cow.' Ha-ha! \nCONTINUED \n66 - - CONTINUED \nRAY I know whose pain I'm supposed to ease. \nANNIE \n(STOPPING SHORT) What? \nRAY I know whose pain I'm supposed to ease. \nANNIE Ray, I just halted the spread of neo-facism in America, and you're talking about --- \nRAY Terence Mann. \nANNIE What about him? \nRAY That's whose pain. \nANNIE How do you know that? \nRAY I don't know. I just know. I was right about building the field, wasn't I? \nANNIE What's his pain? \nRAY I don't know. \nANNIE Then how are you supposed to ease it? \nRAY I don't know. None of this questioning has dampened Ray's pride and excitement. Annie shakes her head. \nANNIE Ray... \nRAY Annie. \nCONTINUED \n66 CONTINUED (2) \nANNIE (tries to put \nTHIS GENTLY) He's my favorite writer too, but...what's Terence Mann got to do with baseball? Ray's smile freezes. Then disappears. He hasn't a clue. \nCUT TO \n67 INT. UNIVERSITY OF IOWA LIBRARY - DAY 67 \nA montage of Ray at the library: checking indices, reading old magazines, finding newspaper interviews on microfilm, s couring old anthologies, and taking copious notes. Some of the articles include: \"Where is Terence Mann Now That We Really Need Him?\". .\"20 Rumors About America's Greatest Living Ex-Writer\" ... and , \"Terence Mann: Still Ignoring Us After All These Years \". The photographs show Mann to be a large black man with gentle eyes. \nRAY (V.O.) Annie, it's incredible. \n68 EXT. LIBRARY \nPISSED) But why do you have to go? Why can't the voice send someone else? What's wrong with Shirley MacLaine, she too busy? What does this have to do with you??? Ray hears her anger and sits her down. \nRAY That's what I need to find out. \nANNIE Ray, we're behind on the mortgage. That field ate up our savings. We could lose the farm. \nRAY I won't even stay in motels. I'll sleep in the car, and I'll beg for food. \nANNIE No. This is too much.- I understand your need to prove to the world you're not turning into your father, but you've done it! You believed in the magic, and it came true. Isn't that enough? \nCONTINUED \n71 CONTINUED (2) 71 \nRAY Annie, it's more than that. I know this- is nuts, but there's another reason I'm supposed to do it. I feel it. I feel it as strongly as I've ever felt anything in my life. There's a reason. \nANNIE What. Just tell me what it is. \nRAY I think something's going to happen at the game. I don't know what, but...there's something at Fenway Park in Boston, and I have to be there with Terence Mann to find it. Something he just said changes Annie's mood. \nANNIE Fenway Park... Is that the one with the big green wall in left field? \nRAY Yeah. \nANNIE I dreamt last night you were at Fenway. \nRAY Uh, was I sitting on the first base side? \nANNIE Yes... \nRAY About the fifth row? \nANNIE (nods, \nOPEN-MOUTHED) You were keeping score and eating \nRAY -- a hot dog. I had the same dream. \nANNIE I'll help you pack. \nCUT TO \n72 INT. BEDROOM 72- \nRay is throwing clothes into a suitcase as fast as he can. Annie reads from a road map she has marked for him. \nANNIE .you take that to 93, and then it gets all squiggly, and after that you're on your own. How are you going to find him, anyway? He won't exactly be in the phone book, you know. \nRAY The article says he has a storefront on Harvard Street next to some place that sells Kosher food. Shouldn't be too hard to find. I don't need a tie, do \nI? \nANNIE No, dear. Not for a kidnapping. \n73 EXT. HOUSE 73 \nRay has packed the car and is getting ready to leave. \nRAY You'll be okay, right? \nANNIE I'll try to sell the combine. We sure don't need it anymore. Karin runs up, grabs Ray behind each ear and hugs and kisses him. \nRAY So long Tiger. He get into the car and looks up at Annie. \nRAY I'll call you every night. If the team shows up while I'm gone, just tell them... (shakes his head) On second thought, stay away from them. Those guys haven't been near a woman since 1922. \nANNIE Ray, they're not going to make a pass at me. They're'ghosts. \nRAY They're jocks. Keep away from them. \nCONTINUED \n7 3 CONTINUED 73 She laughs, kisses him, and watches him drive off. \nCUT TO \n74 ON THE ROAD 74 Ray's brave little Datsun chugs along the interstate between eighteen-wheelers, busses, gasoline tankers, auto-transport trucks, and other monsters. \n75 TRAVELING MONTAGE 75 Driving...gas stations...boring roadside restaurants... getting lost...looking at the map...signs that announce the \"Entering\" and \"Leaving\" of various states...days turning to nights and back again... .Finally, the green hills of Massachusetts. \nCUT TO \nMANN Oh God. I don't do causes anymore. \nCONTINUED \n85 -CONTINUED \nRAY This isn't a cause. I don't need money, or an endorsement. \nMANN Refreshing. \nRAY You once wrote: 'There comes a time when all the cosmic tumblers have clicked into place, and the universe opens itself up for a few seconds, to show you what is possible.' \nMANN Oh my God. \nRAY What. \nMANN You're from the Sixties! \nRAY Well, actually --- \nMANN Out! Out! \nRAY Just wait a second --- Mann picks up an old-fashioned bug sprayer -- the kind with a long arm that pumps in and out -- and starts spraying it at Ray as if he were an unwanted insect. \nMANN Back to the Sixties! Back! He is backing Ray out the door. \nRAY If you'd just --- \nMANN There's no place for you here in the future! Get back while you still can! He gets Ray just past the door and slams it shut. Ray slams it open. He's pissed. \nRAY You've changed, you know that? \nCONTINUED \n85 CONTINUED (2) 85 Mann stops fuming and considers that. He sighs, sadly. \nMANN Yes. I suppose I have. How's this? (smiles and makes the peace sign) 'Peace, love, dope.' \n(ROARS) Now get the fuck out of here!!! And he slams the door shut again. Ray is flabbergasted. He is thinking furiously. Then he notices that in slamming the door, the latch has not locked in place. He thinks, makes up his mind, and quietly opens the door. Mann has returned to work, his back to the door. Ray enters the loft, his left hand in his jacket pocket. When he is halfway across the loft, he clears his throat. Mann spins around. \nMANN Now you've pissed me off. \nRAY Okay, hold it right there. He juts his pocketed hand forward, as if he had a gun in his jacket. \nRAY I was hoping I wouldn't have to do it this way... \nMANN What the fuck is that? \nRAY It's a gun. What'd you think it is? \nMANN It's your finger. \nRAY No it's not. It's a gun. \nMANN Yeah? Let me see it. \nRAY Get out of here, I'm not going to show you my gun. Mann sighs, and stands. \nCONTINUED \n85 CONTINUED (3) \nRAY Now look. I'm not going to hurt you, I just need you to go with me for a little while, then -- what are you doing? Mann has found a crowbar among his tools, and is advancing toward Ray. \nMANN I'm going to beat you with a crowbar till you go away. Understandably, this makes Ray nervous. \nRAY Whoa! Wait! You can't do that. \nMANN \n(STILL ADVANCING) What, are there rules? There's no rules. Mann is almost to him, now, the crowbar raised above his head. \nRAY You're a pacifist! Mann stops. He thinks. He lowers the crowbar. \nMANN Shit. Ray breathes a sigh of relief. \nRAY Thank you. \nMANN All right, are you kidnapping me? What's the deal here? \nRAY I'm sorry. I was hoping I could-just convince you to come with me. \n91 CONTINUED (2) \nRay nods. Mann is making sense. \nMANN They'd bleed me dry. \n92 SECTION SEVENTEEN \nRay and Mann emerge into the sunlight and walk down the aisle toward the field. \nRAY God, this place is so beautiful. The grass is so green you can almost smell it. Looking around the old ballpark, they see only about twenty or thirty die-hard fans in the stands for batting practice; a half-dozen players are grouped around the batting cage as one player hits to several others in the field. A few sportswriters and other civilians stand near the dugouts. Ray and Mann stop at the first row, right behind the Red Sox on-deck circle, lean on the railing and talk. \nRAY It could be 1912 out there, for all this place has changed. Babe Ruth stood on that very mound as a pitcher long before anyone knew he could hit home runs. Same mound. \nMANN Why are we here, Ray? \nRAY Something.. about the game. \nCUT TO \n93 THE GAME - NIGHT \nThe game is in progress. Ray and Mann are in their fifth row seats. They do not speak. At one point, Ray becomes suddenly and strangely aware that something is about to happen. He looks at Mann who is just watching the game. Then he looks at the scoreboard. \n94 THE SCOREBOARD 94 Fenway Park has a sophisticated scoreboard that flashes pictures of the batter and pitcher, and can show instant replays of some of the action. \nCONTINUED \n94 CONTINUED \nRight now, the display is replaced by an oddly glowing message. The sounds of the stadium, the game, and the crowd fade out. There is only the message: \nARCHIBALD \"MOONLIGHT\" GRAHAM Chisholm, Minn. New York Giants \nLIFETIME STATISTICS: 1 Game, 0 At Bats The message does not just glow, it pulsates. It looks almost otherworldly, phosphorescent; clearly unlike anything ever seen before on a ballpark scoreboard. \n95 RAY AND MANN \nRay looks around him. The sounds of the game return, and from the unconcerned faces of the people near him, he realizes that no one else can see the message. He opens his program and starts writing it down. Mann notices this, but cannot see what Ray is writing. Then Ray hears The Voice. \nTHE VOICE 'Go the distance.' \nRAY Oh my God. \nMANN What's the matter? \nRAY Nothing. \nMANN You okay? Ray sighs. \nRAY Yeah. \n;THEN) Whenever you wanttogo,wecan go. \nCONTINUED \n95 CONTINUED \nMANN What??? \nRAY If you want to go, we can go. Mann looks at Ray curiously, trying to read this new attitude. \nMANN Then let's go. Mann rises and heads up the aisle. Ray looks down at the program -- at the handwritten legend of Moonlight Graham, who played one game fifty-seven years ago, but did not get to bat -- and follows Mann out of the ballpark. \nCUT TO \n96 THE RIDE BACK TO BOSTON 96 It is nighttime, and Mann drives. Ray slumps, dozing, troubled. Mann looks curiously at Ray, but says nothing. They ride in silence. \nCUT TO \n97 MANN'S STREET - NIGHT \nThe street is blue with moonlight as they park in front of the storefront. \nMANN Where are you goingfrom here? \nRAY Home. \nMANN What is it you're not telling me? \nRAY (shakes head no) I've taken up too much of your time. Mann gets out of the car. \nRay is using the pay phone on the wall of the office, while the car is being gassed. \nANNIE (V.0.) \n(PHONE; FILTERED) Uh, fine. \nRAY Hey, guess what? Terence Mann is with me. We're going to Minnesota together. \nANNIE (V.0.) \n(PHONE; FILTERED) Are you kidding me? Oh, Ray, that's unbelievable! \nRAY I know. I gotta go. Hug Karin for me. I love you. \nANNIE (V.O.) \n(PHONE; FILTERED) I love you too. You guys behave yourselves. Hurry home. \nCONTINUED \n100 CONTINUED \nRay smiles and hangs up. \nCUT TO \n101 ANNIE'S KITCHEN \nShe hangs up, and loses her smile as she turns back to the kitchen table, where her brother Mark sits with two men in business suits. \nMARK Why didn't you tell him? \nANNIE For the same reason I've never pissed on your birthday cake. \nMARK Annie, you don't have a choice in the matter. Annie looks vertroubldye. \nCUT TO \n102 ON THE ROAD - MINNESOTA \nThey are north of Duluth,andthelandscape hasgrown harsher, the trees shorterandmore gnarled, thegrass tougher and wirier. After Virginia, Minnesota, all the land is scarred. Above the town the mines sit like sand-colored bunkers in the cliffs,- stern and silent. Near Chisholm, the land is getting ever weirder. It looks like a pasture rooted and rerooted by giant hogs. It has been split and gutted; greenery has grown back, but at weird and unnatural angles. But as they swing into town; the highway divides and they cross a beautiful and tranquil lake, so smooth and shiny it might be a scene painted on a glass plate. A sign reads \nWELCOME TO CHISHOLM. \n103 CHISHOLM, MINNESOTA \nRay and Mann have parked on the main street next to a corner phone booth. Ray is flipping through the thin phone book attached to the booth by a chain. \nCONTINUED \n103 CONTINUED \nRAY Half a dozen Grahams...no Archibald, no Moonlight. \nMANN Follow me. \nCUT TO \n104 EXT. CHISHOLM FREE PRESS \nThe local newspaper is located in a small storefront that was probably once a confectioners or a dry-goods store. \n105 INT. CHISHOLM FREE PRESS \nRay and Mann are talking with the paper's publisher, Veda Ponikvar, a handsome woman in her sixties, with a sweet, innocent smile, and eyeglasses hanging from a fine chain around her neck. \nMANN We're trying to find an ex-baseball player named Archibald Graham. \nVEDA You mean 'Doc' Graham. \nRAY No, I think his nickname was 'Moonlight.' \nVEDA Yes, that's Doctor Graham. \nMANN Doctor Graham. This is interesting news to Ray and Mann. \nVEDA His baseball career never amounted to much, so he went back to school. His father was a doctor. \nMANN Do you know where we can find him? \nRAY It's nothing bad. We're not from the IRS, or anything --- \nMOTEL MANAGER Well, it's funny. It's like all these memories we have of Doc had gone to sleep and sunk way down inside us. But once you started asking about him, and started us talking about him, why they swum back up to the surface again. Ray smiles. \nCUT TO \n111 MOTEL ROOM \nRay and Mann are sitting in their beds, comparing their notes. \nMANN No screwing, no drinking, no opium, no illegitimate children. No-midnight abortions, no shady finances. Ray puts down his notes and picks up the Chicago Tribune. \nRAY You sound disappointed. \nCONTINUED \n111 CONTINUED \nMANN Shoeless Joe had a problem. That's why he needed you. This guy doesn't need us. Suddenly, Ray straightens with a start. \nRAY Oh, My God. Ray hurries over to Mann, offering the opened newspaper, and points out an article to Mann. It is headlined: \nTERENCE MANN MISSING. \nMANN Damn. \n(READS) 'His son, who lives in New York City, notified police after receiving no answer to repeated telephone calls...' Shit. I'd better call him. He pulls the phone onto the bed and dials \nMANN What the hell do I tell him. \nRAY You want me to...? He motions outside with his head. \nMANN Thanks. Ray exits. \nCUT TO \n112 EXT. CHISHOLM RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 112 \nRay walks by the old movie theatre, which sits at the edge of a residential street. The Godfather is playing. He nods at an elderly man who passes him on the street. He passes a darkened house and notices there is a sign of some kind in its unlit front window. He takes another two or three steps before he has, to stop to take a better look at the sign. \n113 THE SIGN \nIt takes a second to make out the image in the dark, but it is a head shot of Richard Nixon. Above, it says \"Four More Years\". Below, it reads \"Re-Elect The President\". \n114 RAY \nis puzzled. He turns and looks at the theatre marquee. \n115 THE THEATRE MARQUEE \nUnder the letters that spell out \"The Godfather\", are smaller letters that read \"Nominated for 10 Academy Awards\". \n116 RAY \nfrowns. He says the word to himself. \nRAY Nominated? Ray now looks at the car parked nearest to him. \n117 THE CAR \nIt is an old Mustang. The annual tag on the license plate reads: 1972. \n118 ?? RAY \nLOOKS-AROUND \n119 HIS POINT OF VIEW \nAll the cars on the street are pre-1972. And still walking down the block away from him, is the elderly man Ray passed moments earlier. The man is about sixty-five years old, stooped a little, but the body is still lithe, an athlete's body. He is wearing a dark overcoat... \n120 CLOSER POINT OF VIEW \n.and he carries an umbrella. \n121 RAY 121 The little hairs on the back of Ray's neck stand up. His mouth is dry, and for a moment, he cannot speak. Then, he calls to the man. \nRAY Doctor Graham? Slowly, the man stops and turns back to face Ray. Ray starts to trot to him. \nELDERLY MAN Who's that? \nRAY My name is Ray Kinsella. I'm from Iowa. Are you Moonlight Graham? The old man narrows his bright eyes to see Ray more clearly. \nDOC GRAHAM No one's called me 'Moonlight' Graham for fifty years. \n130 POINT OF VIEW \nSomething down the road, in the midst of all this flat farmland, is glowing in the night. It is an illuminated baseball diamond in a cornfield. \n131 RAY AND ANNIE'S FARM - NIGHT Ray turns the Datsun into the long driveway and, with a rumble, crosses the metal cattle guard that keeps livestock from escaping to the roadway. He eases the car to a stop in front of the house, and as the three men unfold themselves from the car, Karin bolts from the back door of the house, a blur of white blouse and pink pedal pushers. She flings herself into Ray's arms, and hugs his neck in unrestrained joy. \nKARIN Daddy! Then Annie appears too. They kiss while Mann and Archie wait to be introduced. Finally, Mann clears his throat. \nRAY \n( (BEAMING) Karin, Annie... This is Terence Mann \nMANN Terry. \nKARIN Hiya Terry. Annie steps forward, wining some curls from her eyes with ahand that has recently been immersed in flour'. She smiles, wipes the hand on the thigh of her jeans, and shakes his hand. \nANNIE Welcome. \nMANN Thank you. \nRAY And this young fellow is Moon -- uh, Archie Graham. Karin and Annie shake his hand. \nRAY He's come to practice with the team. \nCONTINUED \n131 CONTINUED \nANNIE He'll be able to do more than just practice. \nRAY What does that mean? \nANNIE Come on. They walk towards the field. \nANNIE Let's enjoy this place while we still have it. \n132 EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - NIGHT \nRay and Annie walk silently with their arms around each other as they lead Mann, Archie and Karin to the bleachers. Mann's eyes widen as several of the players shout greetings to Ray. \nSHOELESS JOE Hi, Ray, welcome back. \nRAY Thanks, Joe. Good to see you. \nMANN Oh my Lord. \nRAY What. \nMANN That's Shoeless Joe Jackson! \nRAY Well of course it is. \nMANN I've seen pictures. Those are the White Sox! \nRAY You mean you still didn't believe me? \nMANN I thought I did, but... Oh my Lord. They have reached the foul line where Shoeless Joe waits for them. \nCONTINUED \n132 CONTINUED \nRAY Terry, I'd like you to meet Joe Jackson. Joe, this is Terry Mann. Mann and Jackson shake hands. \nMANN It's a pleasure to meet you. \nSHOELESS JOE Pleasure's mine. \n(TO RAY) Ray, I hope you don't mind, but we got tired of just having practices, so we brought another team out with us so we could have some real games. He points to the visitors' bench, and, indeed, there are a dozen or so more old-time baseball players in old-time baseball uniforms. \nRAY I don't mind. Where'd they come from? \nSHOELESS JOE \n(CHUCKLES) Where'd we come from. Man, you wouldn't believe how many guys wanted to play here. We had to beat 'em off with a stick. \nARCHIE \n(FROM THE \nBLEACHERS) Hey, that's Mel Ott. And Carl Hubbell. Those are the New York Giants! \n134 CONTINUED \nCHICK GANDIL We sleep. \nHAPPY FELSCH And wait. \nSHOELESS JOE We dream. \nRAY You can't leave the field any other way, can you? \nSHOELESS JOE Not if we want to come back. \nRAY I'd love to go with you sometime. The silence that follows is long and ominous. \nRAY I'd like to see what's out there. There is still no response. \nRAY I'll take that as a no for now. He spots Archie jogging off the field. \nRAY Hey, slugger, congratulations! Archie jogs over. \nARCHIE Thanks. I can't stop shaking I'm so happy. 'Course, I would've liked a base hit... \nKARIN But you got a RBI! \nARCHIE I sure did, didn't I? \nSHOELESS JOE \n(YELLS BACK) A rookie's luck! They all laugh at that. \nRAY Well come on, this calls for a drink. \nCONTINUED \n134 CONTINUED (2) \nArchie hesitates. \nARCHIE I can't. I'm... He motions with his head toward the other players disappearing through the outfield door. Ray nods understandingly. \nRAY Good game, Archie. \nARCHIE Thanks. \nMANN Good night, kid. Ray, Karin, Annie and Mann watch Archie jog towards the rest of the players. When he reaches the fence, he turns back to them. \nARCHIE Mr. Kinsella? Ray turns toward him. Archie looks as if he knows more than he's saying. \nARCHIE Thank you for bringing me here. I couldn't have wished for anything more. Ray recognizes there may be more behind those words than just a teenager's pleasure. But he decides not to ask any questions. \nRAY I know. You're welcome. Archie runs through the door in the fence and vanishes. \nCUT TO \n135 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nMann and Karin eat their country breakfasts at one and of the table, while at the other end, Annie and Ray sit in front of the bank books, ledgers, and the sheaf of bills puffed up around the paper spike. \nANNIE Once we fell behind in the payments, the full amount of the mortgage became due. \nCONTINUED \n135 CONTINUED \nRAY And they own the paper, so they have the legal right to foreclose. \nANNIE Unless we sell. \nRAY Either way we lose the farm. Maybe we can make it a condition of the sale that they keep the field up. \nANNIE Forget it. They're buying up single farms all around us, make it one big farm. First thing they'll do is plow under your field. Ray just sits there, letting that sink in. \nCUT TO \n136 EXT. FARM - DAY \nRay and Mann walking. \nMANN I don't have a lot of money, Ray, but maybe I could pitch in a little. \nRAY Fine. You can put in twenty bucks for groceries. \nRAY No deal, Mark. We're staying. \nKARIN We don't have to go. \nMARK \n(EXPLODES) You're virtually bankrupt, and I'm offering you a way to keep your home because I love my sister! I've got partners who don't give a damn about you, and they're ready to foreclose right now! \nKARIN Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm. \nMARK Karin, please! \nRAY Wait. They all turn to Karin. \nKARIN People will come. \nRAY What people, sweetheart? \nCONTINUED \n137 CONTINUED (3) \nKARIN From all over. They'll just decide to take a vacation, see, and they'll come to Iowa City, and they'll think it's really boring, so they'll take a drive. And they'll drive down our road, and they'll see the lights and they'll think it's really pretty. Ray, Annie, and Mann listen with wonder, to this vision. \nKARIN So, the people in the cars? They'll drive up and they'll want to pay us, like buying a ticket. Mark looks at them all as if they're crazy. \nMARK You're not listening to this seriously, are you? \nANNIE Yes. \nMARK Why would anybody pay money to come here? Karin looks at her Uncle mark as if he were a simpleton. \nKARIN To watch the game. And it'll be just like when they were little kids a long time ago, and it was summertime, and they'll watch the game and .remember what it was like. Ray and Annie couldn't be prouder of their daughter than they are right now. \nMARK What the hell is she talking about? \nANNIE She's talking about people seeing their memories... touching their past. \nRAY \n(NODS) People will come. \nCONTINUED \n137 CONTINUED (4) \nANNIE It'll be like one of those tiny, French restaurants that have no sign. You find it by instinct. They'll be drawn. \nMARK Okay, this is all fascinating, but the fact remains that you don't have the money to bring the mortgage up to date, so you still have to sell. I'm sorry, but you have no choice. He produces a document and hands it to Ray with a pen. Ray looks at it. He doesn't know what to do. \nMANN Ray... Ray looks at Mann. \n138 MANN \nspeaks now as he has not spoken for many years: as Terence Mann, master of words, spellbinder. \nMANN People will come, Ray. They'll come to Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom. They'll turn up your driveway, not knowing for sure why they're doing it, and arrive at your door, innocent as children, longing for the past. 'Of course we won't mind if you look around,' you'll say. 'It's only twenty dollars per person.' And they'll pass over the money without even looking at it. For it is money they have, and peace they lack. \n139 MARK \npushes the papers. forward. \nMARK Just sign the papers, Ray. \n140 MANN \nis not one to give up. \nCONTINUED \n140 CONTINUED \nMANN They'll walk out to the bleachers and sit in shirtsleeves in the perfect evening, or they'll find they have reserved seats somewhere in the grandstand or along one of the baselines -- wherever they sat when they were children and cheered their heroes. They'll watch the game, and it will be as if they'd dipped themselves in magic waters. The memories will be so thick they'll have to brush them away from their faces. \n141 MASTER \nSpellbound, Ray has put the papers down. Mark picks them up again. He is battling Mann for Ray's attention. \nMARK Listen to me. Tomorrow morning, when the bank opens, they will foreclose. \nMANN People will come, Ray. \nMANN How long? \nRA Y Its a twenty-minute drive. Mann winces. He knows that could be fatal. Ray kneels by Karin. Her nose and one side of her face have been scraped by the fall. Blood starts to trickle from her nose, across her cheek and down her neck. She is becoming bluer and her cough is faint, as though she is in another room. \nCONTINUED \n147 CONTINUED \nMark takes off his $300 pale-green velvet corduroy jacket and is wordlessly holding it out to Ray. Ray takes the jacket and covers Karin gently. Karin is getting paler, bluer, and her breathing more strained and distant. \nRAY Karin... Then, without reason, Ray slowly turns toward the field. The White Sox stand near him by the fence, the Giants stay around their bench. All except one: young Archie Graham. \n148 ARCHIE GRAHAM \nhas noticed the'commotion in the bleachers, and he starts to lope across the field. \n149 BLEACHERS \nAnnie has pulled the car over and honks. Ray holds up his hand to her to wait. His eyes are on young Archie Graham. \n150 YOUNG ARCHIE GRAHAM \nAs Graham gets closer, his features begin to change, and his step slows. He reaches the end of the fence -- around which no player can pass -- and when he emerges from the shadows on the bleachers side, he is no longer young Moonlight Graham, the ballplayer of long ago...but Doc Graham, the old man from Chisholm, Minnesota. His baseball glove has turned into a black doctor's bag. \n151 THE BLEACHERS \nas Doc Graham approaches. \nDOC GRAHAM What have we got here? \nRAY She fell. Doc kneels beside her and instantly knows what is wrong. \nDOC GRAHAM This child's choking to death. \nCONTINUED \n151 CONTINUED \nHe picks her up with one hand under her shoulders and the other under her knees, seats himself on the bleachers, and turns her face down. Supporting her chest with one hand, he delivers a series of sharp blows between her shoulder blades with the heel of his other hand. Annie honks again. Ray waves her to him. Mark cannot believe what he is seeing. Suddenly, Karin's diaphragm expands as she sucks in air. Doc reaches around and pries her mouth open, releasing a sizable piece of hog dog and bun. As he turns her over, we can see the blueness disappearing from her face as she continues to breathe deeply. Doc peels back each eyelid in turn, stares at the pupil for a few seconds, and lets the eye close. \nDCC GRAHAM She's okay. I don't think the fall really hurt her, just the dog in her throat. She'll be coming around in a minute or two. \nRAY \n(SIGHS DEEPLY) Thank you, Doc. Doc looks deeply into Ray's eyes. \nDOC GRAHAM No, son. Thank you. It just now sinking for Ray what-Doc Graham has sacrificed to save the child. Ray looks to the field, and then back at the Doctor. \nRAY 'Oh, my God, you can't go back. \nDOC GRAHAM It's okay... \n(NODS KNOWINGLY) It's okay. \n152 MARK AND ANNIE \nMark is slack-jawed. He has seen something magical happen and cannot explain it. \nMARK I saw...A11 of a sudden this kid runs off the field and turns.into... \nCONTINUED \n152 CONTINUED \nHe looks questioningly at Annie. She smiles reassuringly. \nANNIE There's hope for you yet, Mark. \n153 RAY AND DOC GRAHAM \nDoc Graham stands, and picks up his black bag. \nDOC GRAHAM Well, I best be getting back home before Alicia starts to thinking I've got a girlfriend. He walks around the edge of the fence, and heads for the outfield door. The players respectfully make way for him. \nHAPPY FELSCH Good work, Doc. \nEDDIE CICOTTE Way to go, Doc. \nDOC GRAHAM Thanks, boys. Win one for me, someday, will you? He passes them. \nSHOELESS JOE Hev rookie! Doc Graham turns. \nRAY \n(NODS) Out. \nANNIE \n(HUMS TWILIGHT \nZONE THEME) Doo-doo-doo-doo. Be careful. She smiles brightly and gives Mann a kiss on the cheek. Mann shakes Ray's hand. \nRAY-- I want a full description. \nMANN -You take care of this family, Ray. Mann joins several of the White Sox as they leave the field. \n155 MARK \nis absolutely dumbfounded as'he sees the players fade out upon walking through the outfield gate. He turns to Annie. \nMARK He just... Where'd he...? \nCONTINUED \n15.5 CONTINUED \nANNIE You go inside and lie down. I'll explain later. Mark walks off toward the people in their cars outside the house. \nMARK Where'd all these people come from...? \n156 BACK AT THE FIELD \nOnly a few players are left on the field. \nRAY We're keeping this field. \nANNIE You bet your ass we are. Ray realizes Shoeless Joe is staring at him, with a shit-eating grin on his face. \nRAY What.. Shoeless Joe just keeps smiling. \nRAY What're you grinning at, you ghost? \nSHOELESS JOE 'If you build it... He nods toward where the catcher is taking off his gear at home plate. \nSHOELESS JOE ' .he will come.' Ray looks at the Catcher. The hairs on the back of his neck begin to stand up. \nRAY Oh, my God. \nANNIE What is it? \nRAY Its my father. \n157 THE YOUNG CATCHER has taken off his mask. He is in his early twenties. He is in the same pose as the photo we saw in the prologue. \n158 RAY AND SHOELESS JOE Ray blanches and turns to Shoeless Joe, his voice a strangled whisper. \nRAY Say it ain't so,- Joe. \nSHOELESS JOE I'm afraid it is, kid. The Catcher is now walking toward Ray. \nRAY \n(FINALLY \nUNDERSTANDING) 'Ease his pain...' \nSHOELESS JOE (smiles and nods) 'Go the distance.' When he says those words, Shoeless Joe sounds just like The Voice. \nRAY It was you. \n159 SHOELESS JOE \nSHOELESS JOE No, Ray. It was you. Shoeless joe winks and walks away, disappearing through the door in the outfield fence. \n160 RAY AND ANNIE \nThe Catcher is halfway across the field. Ray turns to Annie. He cannot even swallow. \nRAY My God, I only saw him later, when he was worn down by life. Look at him. The young Catcher has reached the outfield grass. Ray walks down to the edge of the outfield. \nCONTINUED \n160 CONTINUED \n", "test1_input": "56 IN THE OUTFIELD \nThe Man spreads his feet, pounds his small, old-style glove, and waits to field the ball. \n57 AT HOME PLATE 57 Ray tosses the ball a few feet into the air and swings at it. And misses. His face reddens, he clears his throat, and tries again. This time he connects. \n58 THE FIELD 58 He has hit a grounder that would be easily fielded by a shortstop had there been one, but it bounces through and falls into left field. The Man runs in for it, scoops it up cleanly and throws it back to the plate. Ray is thrilled. He hits another ground ball, and this too, is fielded cleanly. Then another, which the Man deftly short-hops. Ray hollers out to him. \nRAY How's the field play? \nTHE MAN It's good. The ball bounces true. Ray smiles with pride. He tosses up another ball, gives it his best swing, and is thrilled to see he has actually lofted one into the air. But into center field. The Man sprints across the outfield, and makes a lovely catch in short center. Instead of throwing the ball in, the Man runs it in, loping toward home plate. Ray's heart thumps. \nRAY Hi. The Man nods at him, takes the bat, and tests it to feel its weight. \nRAY Ray Kinsella. \nTHE MAN Joe Jackson. Ray is thrilled to hear the words spoken. It is Shoeless Joe Jackson after all, who stands not five feet away from him, trying out all the bats now. Ray isn't quite sure if he should talk, or ask questions, or just stand there. Finally, he can't help himself. \nRAY I bet its good to be playing again, huh? \nSHOELESS JOE It was like having part of me amputated. \nCONTINUED \n58 CONTINUED Joe looks over at Ray, now, his dark eyes evincing the pain his steady voice tries to conceal. \nSHOELESS JOE I've heard that old man wake up and scratch itchy legs that've been dust for fifty years. That was me. I'd wake up in the night with the smell of the ballpark in my nose and the cool of the grass on my feet. The thrill of the grass... He has found the bat he likes. \nSHOELESS JOE Can you pitch? \nRAY \n(WITH FALSE \nMODESTY) Yeah, I'm not bad. Joe hands Ray the bucket of balls. Ray can barely contain his excitement as he races to the mound. He stands on the rubber and faces Joe at the plate. \nRAY Don't we need a catcher? \nSHOELESS JOE Not if you can get it near the plate, we don't. Ray smiles, takes a breath and starts his windup, during which he says aloud to himself: \nRAY I am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson. He makes a pitch. It's not a very good one, and Joe has to step across the plate to make contact, but his swing is graceful, compact and effortlessly powerful. He drives the ball against the fence. Ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back, Jackson is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch. Ray makes the standard pitcher's gesture for a curve ball. \nRAY See if you can hit my curve. \u00b0He goes into an elaborate windup, throws it, it does not curve much, and Jackson whistles it right by Ray's ear. \nCONTINUED \n58 CONTINUED (2) 58 \nRAY Yes, he can hit the curve. \nSHOELESS JOE Stick with fast balls, kid. \nRAY You bet. Ray makes another pitch, and Jackson hits a line drive down the third base line. Then a smoker down the first base line. Ray is mightily impressed. \nRAY Wow. \nSHOELESS JOE Damn, this feels good. Put it right here, huh? Joe holds the bat out low over the plate and Ray pitches it reasonably close to that spot. Jackson hits it out of the park, and beams. Ray brightens up with remembrance. \nRAY Right, you were a low ball hitter. \nSHOELESS JOE Oh man, I did love this game. You know, I'd have played for food money. it was the game, the sounds, the smells. You ever held a glove or a ball to your face? Ray smiles as he walks in from the mound. \nRAY Yeah. \nSHOELESS JOE And it was riding the trains from town to town. And the hotels with brass spittoons in the lobbies and brass beds in the rooms. And it was the crowd getting to their feet when the ball was hit deep. Shoot, I'd have played for free. The sound of a screen door turns their. attention to the house. Annie and Karin are coming out to them. \nRAY My family. Jackson nods and then points to the floodlights. \nCONTINUED \n58 CONTINUED (3) \nSHOELESS JOE What's with the lights? \nRAY \"All the stadiums have them now except Wrigley Field. \nSHOELESS JOE Makes it harder to see the ball. \nRAY The owners found that more people could attend night games. \nSHOELESS JOE \n", "test1_true": "RAY Mr. Jackson: my wife Annie, my daughter Karin. \nSHOELESS JOE Joe. Ma'm... \n(SHAKES ANNIE'S hand and winks \nAT KARIN) Hi. \nKARIN Are you a ghost? Ray and Annie are instantly embarrassed, and try to cover with forced, nervous laughter. \nRAY Karin... (to Shoeless Joe) She's just kidding. \nSHOELESS JOE It's okay. \n(TO KARIN) What do you think? \nKARIN- You look real to me. \nSHOELESS JOE Then I guess I'm real. \nANNIE Would you like to come inside'? \nCONTINUED \n58 CONTINUED (4) 58 \nSHOELESS JOE Uh, thanks, but...I don't think I can. Ray and Annie look at Joe for a moment, not quite understanding the ground rules here. Joe senses their discomfort and changes the subject. \nSHOELESS JOE Hey, can I come back again? \nRAY Yeah. I built this for you. \nSHOELESS JOE There are others, you know. There were eight of us. It'd sure mean a lot to them. \nRAY Oh man, anytime. They're all welcome here. Joe looks out over the field in eager anticipation of the good times to come. \nSHOELESS JOE Thank you, Ray. I appreciate it. See you later, huh? \nRAY Yeah. See you later. \nKARIN Say it ain't so, Joe! Joe laughs and walks to the outfield. Annie puts her arm around Ray and snuggles her head against his chest. Nearby, brook water splashes softly in the darkness, a frog shrills, and fireflies dazzle the night. Joe is in the outfield grass now, walking toward a door cut into the fence. \nANNIE Where's he going? \nRAY \n(SMILING) Through that door in the fence. \nANNIE Since when is there a door in the fence? \nCONTINUED \n58 CONTINUED \nRAY \n(SMILING EVEN \nMORE BROADLY) I don't know. I didn't put one there. Joe reaches the door, opens it, and turns back to Ray, his voice carrying effortlessly through the night air. \nSHOELESS JOE Hey! Is this heaven? \nRAY No. It's Iowa. Shoeless Joe Jackson nods and fades away as he walks through the door in the fence. Ray and Annie looks at each other in absolute wonder. \nRAY We're keeping this field. \nANNIE You bet your ass we are. \nCUT TO \n59 INT. RAY AND ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 9 \nMARK You're going to lose your farm, pal. It is Sunday afternoon, and Annie's family is visiting. her mother, pink-faced and white-dentured, sits ramrod straight in an antique rocking chair. Also present are her brother, Mark, and his wife Dee. \nRAY Come on, it's so big. How can you lose something so big? \nANNIE You misplaced the house once. \nRAY Yeah, but it turned up two days later, didn't it? \nMARK Ray, this stupid baseball field is going to bankrupt you. Everybody knows it. All I'm saying is if you wait till you default on your loan, you lose everything. Sell now, my partners'll \n", "test1_id": 1500, "test2_input": "MANN No, I never slept with her. \nRAY You never slept with who? \nMANN Whoever you were going to ask me about. If I'd been with one-tenth the famous women they said I was with, I'd be in formaldehyde by now. \nRAY \n(INTERESTED) You slept with a lot of famous women? \nMANN \n(SOURLY) What's your question? \nRAY How'd you get a name like Terence? Mann cannot believe that's the question. \nMANN Rastus was taken. \nCONTINUED \n86 CONTINUED (2) \nRay knows now to shut up. He returns his attention to his driving, glances up to his rearview mirror, and sees something that causes his eyes to widen in horror. \n87 REAR-VIEW MIRROR \nA Boston police car on his tail, red lights flashing. \nRAY (O.S.) Oh no. \n88 INT. RAY'S CAR 88 \nMann looks behind him, sees the police car, and turns back to Ray. Ray wears a look of resignation as he pulls the car over to the side of the road, and shuts off the ignition. Mann just looks at him, and starts to chuckle. \nMANN Nice going, Boze. \nRAY Okay. I don't really have a gun. So don't say anything to this guy, okay? I swear to God there's a reason we're supposed to be at this game. Mann gives him a \"Give me a break\" look. Ray sees the Policeman is getting out of his cruiser and walking towards them. Ray is desperate. \nRAY If I get arrested, the press'll be all over you, you'll have to appear in open court, you'll be the lead story on Entertainment Tonight, and your picture'll be on the front page of every tabloid in America. The Policeman knocks on Ray's window. He is young, fresh-scrubbed and earnest. Ray holds up one hand to him. \nRAY Just a second. \n(-CO MANN) 'Terence-Mann Kidnapped... Also seen in UFO with Elvis.' Mann's eyes narrow. The cop knocks again, more insistently. Ray rolls down-the window.\" \nCONTINUED' \n88 CONTINUED \nRAY Sorry. \nPOLICEMAN License and registration. Nervously, Ray complies. Mann turns his face toward the passenger side window. Ray's mouth dries up. He has no idea what Mann will do. The Policeman scrutinizes the license, turns it over to look for convictions, and checks Ray's face against the felonlike photo. Then he looks at Mann. \nPOLICEMAN And what's your name,-sir? Mann keeps his face averted. \nMANN Terry. \nPOLICEMAN Where is it that you and Raymond are going, Terry? \nRAY Fenway Park! We're going to the ball game. \nMANN (turns to cop) Actually, Officer, I'm being kidnapped. Discreetly, under his breath, Ray sings the \"Entertainment Tonight\" theme song. \nRAY 'Entertainment Tonight, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo... Mann winces. The officer looks at him questioningly. \nMANN, What I mean by that is, I don't care much for baseball, but Raymond insisted. \nPOLICEMAN Yeah, I hate baseball. (hands Ray back \nHIS ID) Your right taillight is out, Raymond. I want you to get it fixed at the first opportunity. \nCONTINUED \n88 CONTINUED (2) \nRAY Yes. I will. Thank you. The Policeman walks away, and Ray heaves a sigh of relief. \nRAY 'Terry?' \nMANN 'Raymond?' \nRAY Ray. My...hostages call me Ray. Can I call you Terry? Sourly, Mann nods. Ray smiles and drives off. \n", "test2_true": "MANN I didn't do it just because I don't want the publicity. \nRAY Then what else? \nMANN I envy you your craziness, Ray. It's been years since I did something completely crazy. \nRAY Well, you want to hear something really crazy? \nMANN Do I have a choice? \nRAY Nope. I live on a farm in Iowa. One day, out in the cornfield, I heard a voice... \n89 EXT. CAR \nIt glides through city traffic. \n90 EXT. FENWAY PARK - DAY \nRay slides the Datsun into a parking place, and he and Mann walk the short sleazy block to Fenway, and old-fashioned center-city ballpark. \nCONTINUED \n90 CONTINUED 90 \nMANN \n(SHAKING HIS \nHEAD) But can't you accept the probability that it's all just a hallucination? \nRAY Annie and Karin see it, too. They have reached the ticket window. \nRAY Two, field level, first base side. The elderly Ticket Seller pulls out two tickets. \nTICKET SELLER Section seventeen. Twelve dollars. Ray takes out his wallet and turns to Mann.. \nRAY It's on me. \nMANN You're damn right it is. Ray pays the man and receives the tickets. \nTICKET SELLER Game don't start for a while, but you can go in, watch batting practice. \nRAY Great. They enter the stadium. \n91 INT. STADIUM 91 \nThey walk through the indoor portion of the grandstand toward their section. \nRAY So what do you do with yourself these days? \nMANN I live. I work. I've learned to cook. I take walks. I watch sunsets. \nRAY Don't you miss being... involved? \nCONTINUED \n91 CONTINUED 91 \nMANN \n(SNORTS) I was the East Coast distributor of 'involved.'. I ate it, drank it, and breathed it. Then they killed Martin. They killed Bobby. And then they elected Tricky Dick. Twice. And now, people like you think I must be miserable that I'm not involved anymore. Well, I've got news for you: I spent all my misery years ago. I have no more pain for any of you. I gave at the office. They approach the refreshment stand. \nRAY So...what do you want? \n. MANN I want them to stop looking to me for answers. Begging me to speak again, write again, be a leader. I want them to start thinking for themselves. And I want my privacy! Ray looks slightly embarrassed. \nRAY No, I meant what do you want from... Ray points to the hot dog vendor, as they have reached the front of the line. \nMANN Oh. \n(LAUGHS AT \nHIMSELF) A dog and a beer. \nRAY (to the vendor) Two. \n(TO MANN) Okay, I agree, you should be entitled to as much privacy as you wane. But why stop writing? \nMANN I haven't published a word in seventeen years and I still have to endure assholes like you all the time. What do you think it'd be like if I suddenly came out with a new book? \nCONTINUED \n", "test2_id": 1501, "test3_input": "CONTINUED \n124 CONTINUED (3) \nRAY There is a place where things like that happen. And if you want to go there, I can take you. Doc's eyes start to glisten, and he offers an embarrassed smile as he wipes away a tear. \nDOC GRAHAM If it means leaving Chisholm... He shakes his head.no. Ray is surprised. \nRAY I understand, but I think you're supposed to come with us. \nDOC GRAHAM This is my most special place in the world, Ray. Once a place touches you like this, the wind never blows so cold again. You feel for it like it was your child. I can't leave here. Ray cannot believe the man won't leave Chisholm for his dream. \nRAY But your wish... \nDOC GRAHAM It'll stay one. I was born here, lived here, and I'll die here. That's okay. I'll have no regrets. \nRAY But sixty-five years ago -- for five minutes -- you came this close. (holds up two \nFINGERS) It would kill some men to get that close to their dream and never touch it. They'd consider it a tragedy. \nDOC GRAHAM Son...if I'd only gotten to be a doctor for five minutes. .now that would have been a tragedy. Those words fill up the room, and Ray sinks back against the couch. \nCONTINUED \n124 CONTINUED (4) \nDOC GRAHAM Well, I'd better get home before Alicia starts to thinking I've got a girlfriend. And Doc Graham smiles at him. \nRAY (V.0.) And he smiled. \nCUT TO \n125 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 125 \nIt is later that same night, and Ray has been recounting his experience with Doc Graham to Mann, who appears quietly troubled. \nRAY And then I figured maybe we're not supposed to take him with us. So now I don't know why the hell we were supposed to come here. \nMANN Maybe it was to find out if one inning can change the world. \nRAY Did it? \nMANN It did for these people. If he'd gotten a hit, he might've stayed there. \n(THEN) Your wife called before. She wants you to call her tonight. \nCUT TO \n126 INT.RAY AND ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 126 \nAnnie is asleep. The phone rings, and the speed with which she picks it up suggests that her anxiety to get this phone call prevented her from sleeping very deeply. \nCONTINUED \n126 CONTINUED 126 \nANNIE Ray. \n(PAUSE) I asked the bank if we could miss a payment or two, and they told me they'd just sold the note on the farm to Mark and his partners. So they own the paper now, and he says if we don't sell to them, they'll foreclose. Ray, we don't have the money. \n127 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 127 \nRay holds the phone, pained. \nRAY Okay, look. They can't foreclose for thirty days, or something like that. I've got to take Terry back to Boston first, so it'll be --- \nMANN No. Ray looks over at Mann. \nMANN I'm going to Iowa with you. \nRAY We're coming home.- \nCUT TO \n128 ON THE ROAD - MORNING 128 Ray drives with purpose and speed. Mann looks relaxed. \nMANN Hell, I couldn't quit now. I've got see this ballpark. \nRAY Not everybody can see it. You might not. \nMANN I'll give it a try. As they turn onto the highway near the lake, a Teenager with a dufflebag appears on the side of the road, his arm raised in. a hitchhiker's stance. Ray pulls the car over to the side of the road. \n", "test3_true": "---128 - - - CONTINUED \nRAY I need all the karma I can get right now. The car stops, and the Teenager runs for it. He tosses his dufflebag in the backseat and squeezes in after it. \nTEENAGER Thanks. You're the first car by. I didn't expect to get a lift so soon. Ray starts the car back onto the highway. \nRAY How far are you going? \nTEENAGER How far are you going? \nRAY Iowa. \nTEENAGER Well, if it's okay with you, I'll ride along for a while. I play baseball. Ray and Mann exchange brief smiles. \nTEENAGER I'm looking for a place to play, and I heard that all through the Midwest, towns have teams, and in some places they'll find you a day job so you can play ball nights and weekends. \nRAY This is your lucky day, kid. We're going someplace kind of like that. \nTEENAGER All right! \nRAY I'm Ray Kinsella, this is Terry Mann. \nTEENAGER Hi. I'm Archie Graham. Mann and Ray just look at each other. And the little Datsun heads off down the highway. \nCUT TO \n129 INT. CAR - NIGHT \nArchie sleeps in the backseat. \nMANN I'm dying to ask him if he has a nickname. \nRAY Don't. He didn't get it till he was in the minors. \nMANN Maybe we can give it to him. \nRAY Funny, the way he described towns, finding you a job so you can play on their team...they haven't done that for years. My Dad did that for a while. But that was in the Twenties. \nMANN What happened to your father? \nRAY He never made it as ball player, so he tried to get his son to make it for him. By the time I was ten, playing baseball got to be like eating vegetables or taking out the garbage, so when I was fourteen, I started to refuse. Can you believe that? An American boy refusing to have a catch with his father. \nMANN Why at fourteen? \nRAY That's when I read The Boat Rocker, by Terence Mann. \nMANN Oh God. \nRAY I never played catch with him again. \nMANN \n(SERIOUSLY) See, that's the kind of crap people are always trying to lay on me. It's not my fault you wouldn't play catch with your father! \nCONTINUED \n129 CONTINUED \nRAY I know. Anyway, when I was seventeen, we had a big fight, I packed my things, said something awful, and left. After a while I wanted to come home, but I didn't know how. I made it back for the funeral. \nMANN What was the awful thing you said? \nRAY I said I could never respect a man whose hero was a criminal. \nMANN Who was his hero? \nRAY Shoeless Joe Jackson. Mann considers this all very carefully. \nMANN You knew he wasn't a criminal. Ray nods. \nMANN Then why'd you say it? \nRAY I was seventeen. Mann nods with growing understanding. \nMANN So this is your penance. \nRAY I know. I can't bring my father back.. \nMANN .so the least you can do is bring back his hero. Ray nods. \nMANN Well now we know what everybody's purpose here is...except mine. Ray looks at him. He hadn't thought of that. After a few moments Ray points to something in the distance. \n", "test3_id": 1502}

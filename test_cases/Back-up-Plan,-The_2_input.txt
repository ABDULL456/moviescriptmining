BOBBY I tried to talk her out of it. 
JALISA Why'd you do that, Mami? 
BOBBY (to Jalisa) I know, right? 
JALISA Red pubes.     Eek... 
ZOE I'm never going to see his pubes! 
BOBBY You'll see your kid's pubes. 
ZOE I doubt it. 
BOBBY But you'll know they're there. 
ZOE What is wrong with you? 
JALISA So, what happened?    Come on... 
ZOE I lay down, put my feet up, five minutes later it was over. I barely felt a thing. 
BOBBY Sounds like Ricardo. 
JALISA Tell me about it, Papi. 
Bobby and Jalisa high five.    Bobby then turns to Zoe. 
BOBBY So...what happens now? 
ZOE Now, we wait. 
BOBBY That's no fun, I want to know if I'm going to be a fairy godmother. 
ZOE We'll just have to wait and see. 
Zoe smiles and heads for the back. 
EXT. HUDSON PETS - NIGHT 
The lights in the pet store go dark.   Moments later, Zoe, Bobby, Jalisa and Nuts exit. 
BOBBY Come on, Zoe, one drink. You can have an O'Dhouls or something. 
JALISA We'll go to the piano bar and get Bobby to sing some Ace of Base. 
BOBBY Forget it, she's not coming. I can tell by the dull look on her face. 
ZOE Love you. 
They all hug.   Bobby and Jalisa walk away arm-in-arm, singing. 
BOBBY/JALISA I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign... 
Zoe turns to lock up.   While her back is turned, Stan appears from the shadows. 
STAN Hi. 
ZOE Aahhh! 
Zoe screams and drops the keys. Nuts, overexcited by Zoe's reaction, starts to run/wheel in circles and then tips over. 
ZOE (CONT'D) You scared the hell out of me! 
STAN Oh, wow.   Is he...okay? 
Nuts is still on the ground, his wheels spinning.   Zoe sets him upright. 
ZOE What are you doing here? 
STAN I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Or hurt your dog. Don't worry, I'm not a stalker. 
ZOE How'd you know I worked here? 
STAN I followed you after the subway. (thinks, then) That sounds a little stalkery, huh? 
ZOE Yeah. 
STAN I just really wanted to see you again. Almost like I had to see you again. Can I walk you home? (then) Is it me or does everything I say make me sound more like a stalker? 
Zoe allows a small smile. 
STAN (CONT'D) Can I just give you my card? Here. Take my card. I'm not a freak. Really. I sell cheese. 
This hangs out there for a beat.

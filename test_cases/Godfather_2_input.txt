EXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945) 
The DON's eyes peering through the blinds. 
EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945) 
KAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding, burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine.  She is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and the vitality. 
KAY I've never seen anything like it. 
MICHAEL I told you I had a lot of relatives. 
KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop. We see what she sees: 
Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine barrels. 
KAY (amused) Michael, what are those men doing? 
MICHAEL They're waiting to see my father. 
KAY They're talking to themselves. 
MICHAEL They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right. 
KAY Why do they bother him on a day like this? 
MICHAEL Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day. 
EXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945) 
CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI.  He is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples. She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she holds.  In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt, where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest. CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the things hold. 
Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin. 
CARLO (whispered) Cut it out, Connie. 
The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm, is fat with money. 
PAULIE (O.S.) What do you think?  Twenty grand? 
A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking eyes from the purse. 
PAULIE Who knows?  Maybe more.  Twenty, thirty grand in small bills cash in that silk purse.  Holy Toledo, if this was somebody else's wedding! 
SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY MANCINI, the Maid of Honor.  Every once in a while he glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with some WOMEN. 
He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear. 
SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh. 
WOMAN Is it true what they say about your husband, Sandra? 
SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter. Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais. SONNY and LUCY are gone. 
INT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945) 
The empty hallway.  The bathroom door opens and LUCY surreptitiously steps out. 
She looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing, motioning for her to come up. 
She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs. 
EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945) 
KAY and MICHAEL. 
KAY (in a spooky low tone) Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a relative? 
She has picked out LUCA BRASI. 
MICHAEL No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him. 
KAY (Excited) Who is he? 
MICHAEL (Sizing her up) You really want to know? 
KAY Yes.  Tell me. 
MICHAEL You like spaghetti? 
KAY You know I love spaghetti. 
MICHAEL Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story. 
She starts to eat her spaghetti. 
She begins eating, looking at him eagerly. 
MICHAEL Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did. 
KAY Al Capone! 
MICHAEL My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off... 
KAY Michael... 
MICHAEL Then the legs at the knees... 
KAY Michael you're trying to scare me... 
MICHAEL Then the thighs where they joined the torso.

DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. STREET - CHICKEN ACCIDENT - DAY 
A truck has JACKKNIFED across the avenue and SPILLED its contents -- several THOUSAND baby chicks. They're scurrying everywhere as Brian's company tries to round them up. It's hopeless as the exhausted firemen stuff handfuls of the cheeping cargo into their turn-out coats. There's ghetto kids all around, grabbing at the chicks, grabbing at the fire engine. 
STEPHEN (at kids) Hey! Knock it off! 
Brian stops a beat. Rubs his eyes. 
AXE (smiles) Maybe you should have gotten more sleep last night. 
Brian looks at him. Does he mean what he thinks he means? Tim is coming out of a small store across the street. He hands a small bag of groceries to Adcox. 
TIM This everything you wanted? 
Everyone grows suddenly silent. 
EXT. WIDOW'S HOUSE - DAY 
A fireman's without even saying so, "Petzold" on the mailbox, Engine 17 parked out front. Brian's alone outside, cleaning the diesel fuel off his arms. Watching a small kid playing with a toy fire truck in the drive. 
INT. WIDOW'S HOUSE 
Tim and Brian are loading the groceries into the fridge. Stephen and Grindle are fixing a loose cabinet door as Adcox sits caulking a faucet fitting at the kitchen table with a young WOMAN. 
WOMAN (to Stephen) Can I help you guys at all? 
STEPHEN Nah, we just about got it. 
WOMAN (noticing Adcox's shirt) Sally must be finally ironing your shirts. 
AXE It's just new. Couple'a shifts and it'll be as thrashed as the rest. 
The sight of uniform is too much for her. Her eyes cloud. 
WOMAN I'm sorry... 
Adcox reaches out and lets her weep on his shoulder. 
AXE It's okay... 
WOMAN I miss him... I just miss him, y'know?... 
EXT. WIDOW'S HOUSE - DAY 
Adcox stands out at the fire engine smoking a cigarette, lost in himself, watching the little boy play with his toy fire truck. Stephen's followed him out. 
AXE This job... This fuckin' job sometimes... To buy it trying to go the extra yard, man, that's one thing, but to buy it just because there wasn't any back-up... it's bullshit... 
Stephen leans down close. 
STEPHEN Yeah, it's bullshit. So what? Fuck Swayzak. Fuck 'em all. We don't go into fires for them. You know that. Christ, you taught me that. 
A beat of understanding between them. Stephen looks back at the house. 
STEPHEN You know Knowlton pretty well? 
AXE Yeah... 
STEPHEN (beat) Kind of an asshole, wasn't he? 
Adcox can't help but smile. 
AXE Biggest in two battalions. 
STEPHEN (beat, smiles) We're gonna be okay, man... 
INT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY 
As Brian and Tim scrub down the fire engine, the rest of the company lies sprawled in 
THE STATION REC ROOM 
Watching a weepy soap. Schmidt walks through and is snared by the TV's glow. He hesitates. Shares the moment. 
SCHMIDT Is she going to get the divorce? 
SANTOS (sighs with honest concern) Hell if I know, man. 
A ladderman, WASHINGTON, walks in with a memo. 
WASHINGTON Hey, Pengelly, you made the captain's list! 
Everybody clasps Pengelly on the shoulder. "Way to go". "All right, man". Brian turns and sees Stephen out on the apparatus floor, watching. Watches. Pengelly's younger than him. 
EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - TRAINING BUILDING/HOSE TOWER - DAY 
An expanse of concrete lying out back of the station. Built in one corner is the concrete shell of a five story training building, just wide enough for a stairway and room on each level. Twenty yards away, Brian, Tim and Adcox stand ready beside a pile of coiled hose rolls.

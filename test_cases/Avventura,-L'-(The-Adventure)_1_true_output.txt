SANDRO As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square. 
Claudia is in a playful mood and she is anxious to demonstrate her exuberance. 
CLAUDIA (teasingly) Very well. But you must first tell me that when you go out without me it's like going out without one of your legs. Go ahead, have a look around the town all by yourself, but you'll have to hobble along on only one leg. And you must also tell me that you are filled with a great desire to embrace my shadow on the walls... Then you must tell me... (suddenly her tone of voice changes and she becomes quite serious) You must tell me that you love me. 
Sandro replies with the same good-natured tolerance with which he had been watching Claudia as she danced her coquettish dance. 
SANDRO But you know it already. Why must I tell you? 
CLAUDIA So, you wonder why? 
Without waiting for him to answer, she goes back towards the center of the room and once again starts looking around for her stockings. Sandro begins to leave. 
SANDRO Then I'll see you later. 
CLAUDIA Okay. In a few minutes. 
Sandro goes out the door. Claudia finally locates her stockings and proceeds to finish dressing. 
Sandro comes out of the hotel and crosses over to the sunny square. He starts strolling down along a street which leads to a baroque church that opens up to a wide flight of stone steps. Beyond these steps is a small dead-end street that runs up against the faade of a large and magnificent old building. A few feet away from the faade, seated on a bench in the shade, is an old coachman whose horse is standing beside him with its head deep in a sack of hay. 
Sandro goes down the flight of steps and approaches the door of the old building which is closed. He rings the bell but there is no answer. Then he notices a time schedule posted on the door indicating visiting hours. After glancing at it, he walks over to the seated coachman. 
SANDRO It's closed. Isn't there any custodian or caretaker inside? 
COACHMAN (apathetically) Nobody there. 
SANDRO But it says it's open from 9:30 to 10:30., and it's ten o'clock now...  That's a fine way to greet tourists. 
COACHMAN Tourists? Last year a few Frenchmen came here and they all walked around in their bathing suits. So they were made to understand that it was better if they didn't come at all. 
Sandro shakes his head and is about to say something but he sees the door opening and a man appears.  Sandro goes over to him. 
SANDRO Are you the custodian? 
CUSTODIAN Yes, come right in. 
Sandro enters and finds himself inside a large courtyard of noteworthy architectural design, though somewhat in a state of decay. The custodian goes on his way and Sandro walks further into the courtyard where two young men are studying the architecture. On hearing Sandro's footsteps, they turn around for a moment, then resume their observation. They are, in fact, young architectural students busily engaged in taking notes and copying certain architectural details. They do this with an extraordinary interest, almost with a sense of religious zeal. Sandro continues to stroll through the courtyard. His footsteps are the only sounds to be heard disturbing the otherwise absolute silence. The two young students exchange words between each other but they speak in faint whispers, almost as though they were inside a church. 
Sandro gazes up at the arcades, the columns, the windows. He is obviously filled with a painful sense of regret, resentful and bitter. He turns to look at the two young students who are deep in their studies and ignore his presence. But he is unable to ignore them; they plainly annoy him. In a certain sense, they humiliate him. He turns away and heads towards the exit, walking on the tip of his toes so as not to make any noise. Then he goes out, quietly closing the door behind him. 
In the hotel lobby, a maid is cleaning and dusting, and at the same time, singing little snatches from a popular romantic tune. The hotel manager, who is busy writing something in the register behind the desk, looks up and says: 
HOTEL MANAGER Go ahead, keep right on singing... 
Disappointed, the maid immediately stops singing, and the manager resumes writing. But she quickly looks up again as she hears footsteps coming down the stairs. It is Claudia. 
HOTEL MANAGER (to Claudia) Excuse me for interfering, but I've heard about that girl... Here in this place one gets to know about everything... That girl you're looking for... Why don't you try asking at the youth hostel in Pergusa? Almost all the young girls traveling through here end up there. 
Claudia is immediately interested to hear this bit of news and is about to ask for additional information. But she is suddenly distracted by Sandro who enters the lobby at that very moment. 
CLAUDIA I was just coming out to meet you. How come you're back so soon?

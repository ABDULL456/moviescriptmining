FERGUS Give it over, Dil, for fuck's sake -- 
Still no response. He grows alarmed. He slaps her cheek. She opens her eyes slowly. 
DIL Sorry. I get nervous. I got this blood condition. Just help me inside, Jimmy, then I'll be all right. 
INT. DIL'S FLAT - NIGHT. 
He walks in holding her. Leans her against the wall, then goes to the window to check the street outside. 
She takes a large slug from a bottle of whiskey. 
FERGUS You heard what I said, Dil? 
DIL My pills... 
She points weakly to a cabinet through the open door of the bathroom. 
FERGUS What pills? 
DIL Prescription. For my condition. 
FERGUS What condition? 
DIL My condition. Ennui. 
He goes and gets the pills. 
She takes a handful of pills. She drinks from the whiskey bottle. 
FERGUS Are you supposed to take that many? 
DIL Only in times of extreme stress. 
She walks around the room, drinking, then sits down. 
DIL See, they all say good-bye sometime. 'Cept for him. 
She looks at the picture of Jody. Then she looks at Fergus. 
FERGUS Are you all right, Dil? 
DIL I will be. 
She stares straight ahead, the bottle clutched in her hands between her knees. 
DIL Go on, then. 
Fergus walks slowly toward the door. 
FERGUS Good-bye, Dil 
DIL Jimmy? 
FERGUS What? 
DIL Don't go like that. 
She looks at him, standing up. Something incredibly attractive about her. 
DIL Can't help what I am. 
He walks slowly toward her. He kisses her, on the lips. 
We see the photograph with the soldier's smiling face. Fergus looks from it to her. She seems to be in a sweet narcotic haze. She reaches out her hand and strokes his. 
DIL Knew you had a heart... 
Fergus sits down on the bed. Dil is lying back on it. 
FERGUS Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man. 
DIL You knew which man? 
FERGUS Your soldier. 
DIL You knew my Jody? 
She still strokes his hand. Her voice is dreamily slurred, her eyes far away. 
FERGUS Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days. 
DIL You knew my Jody? 
FERGUS Are you listening?

HARRY We are not cowards, Grogan, whatever he was!  Let's get the boy off as quick as we may.  Your man shall go for a cart, and take away the body of this unhappy gentleman.  This has been a sad day's work for our family, Roderick James, and you have robbed us of fifteen-hundred a-year. 
RODERICK It was Dorothy did it. 
Roderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his waistcoat, and the letter, and flings them down on the body of Captain Best. 
RODERICK There!  Take her those ribbons. She'll know what they mean; that's all that's left of her of two lovers she had and ruined. 
MICHAEL And now, in Heaven's name, get the youngster out of the way. 
HARRY I'll go with you. 
They mount up and gallop off. 
EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY 
Upon seeing Roderick and Harry ride up, his mother, who has been waiting outside, rushes to her son with wild screams of joy.  He dismounts, and she kisses and embraces him. 
RODERICK (V.O.) I need not tell you how great was my mother's pride and exultation when she heard from Harry's lips the account of my behavior at the duel. 
INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - PARLOR - DAY 
Still much excitement and hustle and bustle. 
HARRY The boy must go into hiding, for a short time anyway.  Dublin is the best place for him to go, and there wait until matters are blown over. 
MOTHER Dublin?  But the poor lad has never been away from home.  He will be as safe here as in Dublin. 
HARRY I wish that were true, Auntie dear, but I'm afraid the bailiffs may already be on their way from Kilwangan. 
INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY 
His mother is rushing about and packing a valise.  Harry sits on the bed. 
RODERICK (V.O.) Harry persisted in the necessity of instant departure, in which argument, as I was anxious to see the world, I must confess, I sided with him; and my mother was brought to see that, in our small house, in the midst of a village, escape would be impossible, and capture would be impossible to avoid. 
INT.  MOTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY 
His mother takes out a stocking from her escritoire, and gives Roderick twenty golden guineas. 
MOTHER (gravely) Roderick, my darling, my wild boy, I have forebodings that our separation is to be a long one.  I spent most of all night consulting the cards regarding your fate in the duel, and all signs betoke a separation.  Here is twenty guineas -- all that I have in the world -- and I want you to keep your father's sword and pistols, which you have known to use so like a man. 
EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY 
Roderick's departure. 
RODERICK (V.O.) She hurried my departure now, though her heart, I know, was full, and almost in half-an-hour from my arrival at home, I was once more on the road again, with the wide world, as it were, before me. 
Roderick waves.  His mother cries. 
EXT.  HIGH ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY 
RODERICK (V.O.) No lad of seventeen is very sad who has liberty for the first time, and twenty guineas in his pocket; and I rode away, thinking, I confess, not so much of the kind of mother left alone, and of the home behind me, as of tomorrow, and all the wonders it would bring. 
Roderick happily riding down the road. 
RODERICK (V.O.) I had no doubts of the future; thinking that a man of my person, parts, and courage, could make his way anywhere.  So I rode on, singing to myself, or chatting with the passersby; and all the girls along the road said, "God save me, for a clever gentleman." 
Farm girls in the fields flirting with him. 
RODERICK (V.O.) As for thoughts of Dorothy Dugan, there seemed to be a gap of a half- a-score of years. 
EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY 
A well-armed gentleman dressed in green, and a gold cord, with a patch on his eye, and riding a powerful mare, puts his horse alongside. 
ARMED GENTLEMAN Good day to you, young sir. 
RODERICK Good morning. 
ARMED GENTLEMAN Where are you bound for? 
RODERICK (after a long look at his companion) That is none of your business. 
ARMED GENTLEMAN Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel? 
RODERICK (pulling out a pistol) Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.

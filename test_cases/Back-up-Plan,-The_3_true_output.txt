OLIVIA Aren't you going to introduce me to your new friend? 
STAN Nope. (to Zoe) Come on. Let me show you around. 
Stan puts his arm around Zoe and leads her away.   Olivia watches them go with her arms crossed. 
EXT. THE LITTLE GOAT CHEESE STAND - LATER 
Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand. 
STAN This is our basic chevre, probably our best seller. The cheese that started it all, as they say. Then over here we have our surface- ripened cheeses. These are the aged/raw milk cheeses. (realizing) This is really boring, huh? 
ZOE No, not at all. 
STAN It's like you're in a foreign country and the only thing to watch on tv is a documentary on cheese. You don't want to watch it, but somehow you can't stop... 
ZOE (laughing) I think it's interesting.    Really. 
STAN All right, you asked for it... (boring voice) The aged/raw milk cheeses are made from raw milk and then aged for four to six months. Sometimes more. Sometimes less. Usually more. Depends on the cheese. 
FRED Stop.   You're killing me. 
FRED, early twenties, white guy with Rasta-type dreads, looks up from behind the counter. 
STAN Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred. (then) She's the one I followed from the subway the other day like a total psychopath. 
FRED Right...I heard about you. 
ZOE I don't know whether to be flattered or terrified. 
FRED Be afraid. 
STAN Don't scare her away.   I'm trying to redeem myself. 
FRED Then you should put down the banjo. You look like a doofus. 
STAN Doofus? (then, to Zoe) Do you think I look like a doofus? 
ZOE I don't really know what a doofus looks like. 
Fred points to Stan. 
STAN Okay. If I put the banjo down, can I take you to lunch or something? 
ZOE I should really get back to work. 
STAN Come on, say the word and we can have a six-course tasting menu at Union Square Cafe. I know the chef. 
ZOE That sounds nice, but, I should probably go. 
STAN Well, can I call you? 
Zoe smiles. 
INT. HUDSON PETS - DAY 
Zoe enters the pet store with two big bags of vegetables. As soon as she steps foot in the store, Bobby and Jalisa accost her. 
BOBBY Okay, spill it. 
JALISA Who is he? What does he do?    How do we know him? 
ZOE What are you talking about? 
JALISA Stan from the Farmer's Market? He's called twice already. 
ZOE Really? 
BOBBY Is he a farmer? Because that's not okay. 
ZOE No.   He makes cheese. 
BOBBY He's a pilgrim? 
ZOE I don't know what he is. He's cute and different and plays the banjo. (then) I think I like him. 
BOBBY What about the, you know, bun in the oven? 
ZOE I really doubt I'm pregnant. 
JALISA You want to be pregnant. You don't want to be pregnant. I'm confused. 
ZOE I want to be pregnant. Of course I want to be pregnant. I mean, I put a lot of thought into this, right? (then) So what did Stan say?

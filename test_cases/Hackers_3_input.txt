PHREAK Thank you. 
Kate answers. 
KATE Hello? 
PHREAK Hey, it's me. 
KATE Phreak? 
PHREAK I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys. 
KATE You think they're going to bust us? 
PHREAK Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time? 
He hangs up just as the cop returns. 
INT. SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM. 
Kate is entirely out of place in the boys' room, as the boys look on amusedly.  She finds the disc behind the condom machine and pockets it. Then she buys a condom from the machine and struts out, smiling sweetly, hot as fire. 
INT. DADE'S PLACE. 
Kate knocks. Mrs. Murphy lets Kate and Cereal in. 
MRS. MURPHY Hi! (looking Kate over) Well, now I see what all the fuss is about. (she shows them to Dade's room) Dade... you have company. 
CEREAL It's a nice room. 
KATE We need your help. 
DADE Do my ears deceive me? 
Kate starts to leave. 
CEREAL Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things. (pause) What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on. 
KATE Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc. 
DADE I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry. 
CEREAL Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something. 
Cereal leaves the room. 
KATE What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help. 
DADE I'm sorry, I can't. 
KATE Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that? 
A knock on the door. Dade's mom peeks in. 
MRS. MURPHY Listen you guys, help yourself to anything in the fridge. Cereal has. 
She leaves. 
KATE (to Mrs. Murphy) Thank you.

JULES Look, we don't even know what the deal is. We're jumping to conclusions. NIC I feel like he has so much potential and he's just wasting it. 
Nic's comment hits a nerve in Jules. JULES What are you trying to say? 
NIC What do you mean, what am I trying to say? 
JULES It feels like there's some subtext here. 
NIC What are you talking about? JULES I don't know: Like mother like son? Is that it? Both of us aimless, wandering in the darkness, "wasting our potential?" Nic won't go there. 
NIC Okay, honey, you're on a whole other tangent and I have no idea what you're talking about. 
JULES Well, maybe it hasn't risen to the plane of consciousness for you yet. 
NIC Yeah.   Maybe not. 
Nic clicks the volume back on, freezing Jules out. 
INT.   PAUL'S RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON 
Paul and Tanya sit at the bar, eating family-meal. 
TANYA So what were they like? 
PAUL Sweet. They were really good kids. The boy's kind of a sensitive jock and the girl's kind of innocent but whip-smart and super cute. 
TANYA Sounds like you connected. PAUL Yeah, we kinda did. 
TANYA Where'd you leave it? 
PAUL We didn't really leave it anywhere. Brooke, the sexy Wiccan volunteer, comes up to Paul bearing a basket of freshly-picked fruits. 
BROOKE Hey Paul. Paul leans over the basket. 
PAUL Whatcha got? Oh cool. First strawberries of the season. 
BROOKE Don't they look awesome? I thought you should have the first taste. And with that, she smiles, hands him the basket and leaves. 
TANYA (mimicking Brooke) "I thought you should have the first taste...of my pussy." 
Paul can't help smiling at the nasty talk. 
PAUL Whoa... 
INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - AFTERNOON 
Clay rummages through the top drawer of Jules' dresser. Laser stands behind him, uncomfortable. LASER Dude, I don't think they smoke pot. 
CLAY Hold up. Clay freezes. CLOSE ON a row of sex toys including a fancy pink, Japanese "all-in-one" dildo and a few DVD's.

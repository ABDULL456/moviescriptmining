MAN IN THE IRON MASK I'm sorry, Keeper... 
The keeper looks for what he tripped on -- a worn Bible.  He snatches it up and grabs a hunk of pages from its middle. 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK No, Keeper, it's my only book! 
Hearing the pleading in the prisoner's voice, the keeper looks squarely at him -- and rips out the pages. 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK What number did you tear out? 
KEEPER Eh? 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK What number, on the first page? 
KEEPER ... Two-thirty-seven. 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..." 
As the prisoner rattles off the names of Biblical genealogy, the jailer gawks at the pages in his hand. 
KEEPER You've... memorized...? 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK What was the end page? 
As the keeper is speechless, the prisoner looks for himself. 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK Six-two-one:  "... Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not love, I am but a clanging cymbal or --" 
The Keeper staggers in shock; the prisoner bubbles with joy. 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK We're playing, Keeper!  A game! Take another page, any page!  Keeper and I are playing a game! 
And the prisoner takes the keeper's fat hands in his own and begins to dance and sing. 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK A game, a game, we're playing a -- 
The keeper's left arm goes rigid, and he clutches his chest with his right hand; he drops upon the stone floor. 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK Keeper...? 
The prisoner approaches the jailer; the man is stoned dead. 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK No... No!  Keeper, please, you cannot die!  You're my only friend! 
The prisoner tries to wipe his eyes, but he can't get at them, inside the mask.  He edges to the open door. 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK Help!  Someone!  Keeper is dead! 
He slumps down beside the open door, and weeps. 
INT.  PALACE - D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - EVENING 
D'Artagnan's room is spartan:  a cot, and weapons laid on a plain table.  It has a single small window, and d'Artagnan stands at it now, looking out into the Palace garden below. 
The guests have all gone home; the party pavilions have been cleared away.  And now in the blue dusk, a solitary lady walks.  She is Anne of Austria, the Queen Mother, the lady we saw in the opening. 
Now, twenty years later, she is a slim frail figure.  Her clothes are drab and simple, like the dress of mourning; she walks in silence, watched at a distance by nun attendants. 
She glances up, and sees d'Artagnan's form in the window. When he sees her looking, he pulls away from the window. 
INT.  PALACE CORRIDOR - EVENING 
D'Artagnan's room is along the same corridor as the Royal Apartments.  D'Artagnan sits at the small table, going over paperwork.  Through his open door he sees that Anne and her attendants are filing along in the corridor, and he rivets his eyes back to his work. 
IN THE CORRIDOR 
Anne reaches the door to her apartment, and looks back to where d'Artagnan's door is open. 
INT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM 
The Queen Mother's ATTENDANT appears at d'Artagnan's door. 
ATTENDANT She wishes a word with you. 
INT.  THE CORRIDOR 
D'Artagnan approaches the Queen Mother, and bows. 
D'ARTAGNAN M'lady...? 
ANNE I understand you saved my son's life today. 
D'ARTAGNAN God smiled upon us.

JACK She's been gone for six months and four days. PETER If she's not back by the end of next week, I'm kicking her kid out! MICHAEL You better give your goddam Sylvia hell for this! JACK Don't worry, she's gonna get it but good! PETER And you can tell her we have a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, goddamn it! He exits. So does Jack. Michael is buried under the three-tiered cake, unable to see around it. MICHAEL Do you guys want some cake? (beat) Guys? 
115   INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  115 In her crib Mary is sleeping.   She's beautiful, she looks happy. 
116   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                  116 Mary is in her playpen, playing with a SQUEAKY rubber giraffe. The DOORBELL RINGS. Peter opens it: standing there before him is a very, very, young, gorgeous girl. SYLVIA (bursting with joy) Hello... I'm Sylvia, Mary's mother. I've come to get her... PETER (completely dazed) Oh, it's you... Wait, I'll go 
get Jack... He stands there, frozen. SYLVIA How's Mary doing? 
PETER (as if he were dreaming) Fine, fine, she's doing great... She's getting her back teeth in lately, it's been a bit rough... SYLVIA Can I see her? 
PETER Oh, yeah, sure, she's in there... They both enter the living room. Mary stares at Sylvia. When she spots Mary, Sylvia suddenly breaks down in tears. Peter is dumbfounded. SYLVIA I don't believe how much she's grown! Recovering, wiping away her tears, she walks over to the playpen. SYLVIA Hello, Mary, hello my darling... She picks her up, hugs her tightly, showers kisses on her. MARY LAUGHS. Sylvia starts crying again. SYLVIA How beautiful she is... Her hair has grown... Look how much she changed, I missed it all. I missed her so much! Peter, in a kind of daze, stares at Sylvia. Without looking at Peter, she dries her eyes and tries to stop crying. SYLVIA I wanted to make life difficult for Jack but I never thought I'd miss her so much... PETER (still in a fog) Oh, yeah... make life difficult for Jack... 
SYLVIA Is he here? PETER What? 
SYLVIA Is Jack here? PETER (snapping out of it) Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll go get him... He exits like a sleepwalker and goes straight into Michael's room. The latter is asleep. 
Peter sits down on the edge of Michael's bed and gently shakes him. PETER Michael, Michael... Sylvia's here. Michael wakes up and looks at Peter. PETER Mary's leaving.

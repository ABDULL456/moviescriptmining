From memory, Mandela writes the first line of the poem: 
Out of the night that covers me ... CUT TO: 
EXT. NEWLANDS - DAY 
The luxury bus comes around a bend in a leafy suburb of Cape Town, right under the flanks of Table Mountain. 
Ahead, we see NEWLANDS STADIUM, home of the World Cup opener between the Springboks and Australia. 
A magnificent old stadium in a beautiful setting. 
INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY 
All eyes on the stadium as the bus idles past, very slowly. This is a coach move. 
COACH One week, boys. 
Excited faces become grave, serious. The bus goes quiet. 
Coach nods to himself, pleased. 
EXT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - DAY 
The bus pulls away. 
WE STAY AT NEWLANDS STADIUM -- and SWOOP UPWARDS until we are looking down on the stadium and surrounding streets. 
This AERIAL SHOT BECOMES A BIG MAP -- 
INT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - SECURITY CENTER - DAY 
-- pinned to a board in the security center. 
JASON We need snipers on top of the stadium and these surrounding buildings. 
Jason leads the meeting. He uses an old-fashioned pointer. All of Mandela's security detail present, plus LOCAL COP BRASS. 
LOCAL COP Not a problem. 
JASON We want these two approaches completely sanitized. 
LOCAL COP Two approaches? JASON We're not going to decide which way we bring him in until the very last moment. (BEAT) We need uniforms, plain clothes, sharp-shooters ... 
LINGA And sniffer dogs. 
JASON Yes. No truck bombs, no Oklahoma City. 
The locals stir, share a look. This is going to be a nightmare. 
JASON We've got an army unit on standby at Silvermine, if you need more men. 
Not an option the cops favor, judging by their faces. 
JASON We're not taking any chances, okay. The President's going to be very exposed. (BEAT) Much too exposed. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - DAY 
The silver Mercedes tools into Cape Town past Groote Schuur. Mandela travels with Barbara, who opens her first file of the journey -- but is forestalled by her boss. 
MANDELA Barbara, I have been studying. 
BARBARA For the summit in Taiwan? Good. 
MANDELA No. Not exactly. 
Mandela hands Barbara a folded SPORTS SECTION. 
MANDELA Test me. 
Barbara unfolds the sports section -- 
-- to reveal COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SPRINGBOK SQUAD. A collector's pull-out. 
Barbara looks at the photos, shakes her head. 
BARBARA They look like thugs. 
Mandela just smiles at that remark. 
MANDELA Block out the names. See if I can recognize them. 
Barbara gives her boss a put-upon look -- this is such a waste of time! -- but blocks out the first row of names. Mandela points at the first photo. 
MANDELA Andre Joubert. (NEXT PHOTO) (MORE) 
MANDELA (CONT'D) Gavin Johnson. (BEAT) Did I get them right? 
BARBARA Yes, Madiba. 
MANDELA (immensely pleased with HIMSELF) This is how I used to study in law school. (next photo is of Chester) Unfortunately, Chester is far too easy to identify. But that will change. It must. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAPE TOWN STREETS - EVENING 
The entire Springbok squad has been on a training run through Cape Town, on ordinary streets, through ordinary people. 
(This is unthinkable in top-level sports anywhere else. It really happened.) 
When they are recognized, drivers toot their horns, pedestrians cheer, kids on bicycles ride with them (mostly still white). 
As they approach the hotel grounds, Pienaar surges to the front, so that he can give them a message as they pass through the hotel gate. 
PIENAAR Players-only meeting in the team room after dinner. 
INT. SPRINGBOK TEAM ROOM - CAPE TOWN HOTEL - NIGHT 
Normally a conference room, now equipped with fridge, pool table, ping pong, sofas, TV etc. 
The entire team has assembled, minus Pienaar. A quiet air. Serious, relaxed.

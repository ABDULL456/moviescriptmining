TRUCKER Okay, then. Good luck.   Enjoy the rest of your trip. 
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 
As Jeff continues pouring the oil, he doesn't notice the mud-streaked Dodge Ram pickup pulling up to the pumps behind him. The driver, EARL, climbs out. The other man remains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up. 
Earl is a beefy man about Jeff's age. He wears a sweat- stained Western hat, cowboy boots and a T-shirt with the sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps. He saunters over to the Cherokee, stands there a beat, looking over Jeff's shoulder. 
Jeff senses something behind him, turns. His eyes widen as he sees Earl, recognizes the pickup as the one he nearly hit a few minutes before. Earl stares at him, unsmiling. 
EARL (flatly) Nice car. 
Jeff is in an awkward position. He's got a half-full upside-down bottle of oil in his hands. If he lifts it now, he'll spill on the engine. He turns his gaze back to the engine, decides to keep pouring. 
JEFF Thanks. 
Earl steps around to the open passenger window, peers in. Jeff watches him, wary. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
EARL Air, C.D., leather -- I guess you sprung for the whole nine yards. 
JEFF I guess. 
EARL Then again, out here, what you really need's a C.B. radio. 
JEFF Is that right? 
The oil bottle empties    out. Relieved, Jeff pulls it away and screws back on the    crankcase cap. He shuts the hood with a thunk and moves    around to the side of the car to remove the gas nozzle    from the tank. Earl blocks his path. 
EARL 'Course, if you use a C.B., you gotta have a handle. 
Jeff says nothing.      This is not a friendly conversation. 
EARL How about Shit-for-Brains? (beat) You damn near killed us back there, boy. 
JEFF Look, I'm sorry, I didn't see you. You pulled out in front of me. 
EARL The hell I did. I saw what happened. 
Looking past Earl, Jeff sees Amy come out of the mini- mart with a bag of groceries. He speaks carefully, anxious to avoid a confrontation. 
JEFF How about if we just forget it, okay? I'm sorry it happened. I don't want any trouble. 
EARL (snorting) Yeah.     I bet you don't. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Earl glares at Jeff before turning away.    He passes Amy, gives her a broad smile. 
EARL Howdy, ma'am. Caught this fellow tryin' to steal your Cherokee. 
Amy takes in the situation. She nods politely. Earl continues into the mini-mart. She approaches Jeff, puzzled. 
AMY What was that about? 
JEFF Nothing. Guy in the truck. Thinks I tried to hit him. 
Jeff glances apprehensively at the man in the pickup, who has not moved during the scene. He looks back at the mini-mart. 
JEFF C'mon, let's go. 
AMY You want me to drive? 
JEFF Later.   Just get in. 
AMY Is something wrong? 
JEFF No, let's just go. 
Jeff climbs in behind the wheel. Amy glances at him and gets in the car. Jeff keys the IGNITION and pulls away. 
INT. CHEROKEE - DRIVING - DAY 
As Jeff steers back onto the highway, he glances in the rear-view mirror, sees -- 
MIRROR POV 
Earl coming out of the mini-mart, staring after the disappearing Jeep. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Jeff shifts in his seat, relieved to be getting away from there. Amy watches the speedometer as it climbs to 75, then 80, then 85. 
AMY This isn't the Grand Prix, you know. 
Jeff releases his foot from the accelerator.     The needle sinks back down to 65. 
She gives him a long contemplative look. 
AMY What's bothering you? 
JEFF I told you. Nothing. (pause) The guy was an asshole.

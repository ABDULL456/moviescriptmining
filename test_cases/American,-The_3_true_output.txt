LARRY Mind if I help myself? 
LARRY opens the tin to find it full of AMMUNITION. 
LARRY Shit. 
He looks around the Ford. 
LARRY Is there any actual candy in this gas guzzler? 
152   EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY                                          152 
JACK turns off under the sign for CASTEL DEL MONTE. 
153   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH STEPS- DAY                      153 
The town square is jam-packed with cars and coaches. 
Hundreds of tourists and locals have gathered on the church steps. There is even a camera crew. 
The church doors open and FATHER BENEDETTO steps out to a huge cheer. 
Behind him, LOCAL MEN are carrying a larger than life painted wooden STATUE OF SAINT DOMINIC. 
Draped over the saint's shoulder and wrapped around his neck are around twenty five or thirty live SNAKES- local Viperi- each one several feet long and as thick as a skinny forearm. 
A local BAND strikes up as the STATUE is carried down the steps, FATHER BENEDETTO leading the strange annual religious parade around the town square, followed by a group of ALTAR BOYS. 
154   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, STREET- DAY                           154 
The giant FORD pulls up outside the town's only proper HOTEL. 
MATHILDE gets out carrying the SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE. 
155   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY                      155 
JACK is looking for someone. The square is so tightly packed it's hard to see, let alone move. 
Then he spots her. 
CLARA. 
She's on the other side of the square, standing on the stone steps beneath a STATUE OF AN EAGLE. Her friend ANNA is beside her, taking photographs of the parade with a small digital camera. JACK moves towards CLARA. 
ANNA, through her viewfinder, is the first to notice him. She points JACK out to CLARA. CLARA waves at him. She says something to ANNA and descends into the crowd. JACK and CLARA squeeze their way through a sea of bodies towards one another as we cut to... 
156   EXT. HOTEL ROOF- DAY                                         156 
MATHILDE emerges through the fire escape door and walks to the edge of the roof. 
She opens the black SAMSONITE CASE and unpacks the top layer of office paraphernalia to reveal the disassembled parts of the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN. 
Expertly she assembles the bastardised gun- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND SUPPRESSOR- slotting a full magazine into the base of the hand grip, snuggling the butt to her shoulder and placing her eye beside the rubber cup on the sight. 
157   EXT. POV FROM TELESCOPIC SIGHTS- DAY                         157 
In the centre of the CROSS-HAIRS: 
JACK and CLARA meet. 
She kisses him. It is a long and loving kiss. 
The CROSS-HAIRS find the centre of JACK's head. 
158   INSERT:                                                     158 
MATHILDE'S FINGER... taking up the trigger slack. 
159   EXT. TELESCOPIC SIGHTS- DAY                                 159 
Other HEADS...

The TRIGGER FINGER, hesitating. 
161   EXT. TOWN SQUARE- DAY                                       161 
We're right in the midst of the crowd. 
JACK and CLARA have to shout at one another above the noise of the band. 
JACK When can I see you? 
CLARA I have to work tonight. 
Their happiness clouds over. But the clouds pass quickly. 
CLARA You come to my apartment after. 
JACK If I asked you would you come away with me? 
CLARA Come away with you? 
JACK Why not? 
CLARA Together? 
JACK Together. 
CLARA Where? 
JACK Wherever. Then when we're through, we could come back here. For good.

EDDIE I'll call somebody. 
MR. WHITE Who? 
EDDIE A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think.  I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue? 
MR. PINK Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue. 
EDDIE Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue? 
MR. BLONDE Well, he's either dead or he's alive or the cops got him or they don't. 
DOLLY to MEDIUM on the cop. 
EDDIE (OS) I take it this is the bastard you told me about. (referring to the cop) Why the hell are you beating on him? 
MR. PINK So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up. 
EDDIE Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire.  That don't necessarily make it so.  Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit?  Please tell me somebody brought something with them. 
MR. PINK I got a bag.  I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station. 
EDDIE Well, let's go get it.  We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside. (pointing to Mr. Blonde) You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop. (referring to Mr. Pink and Mr. White) You two take a car each, I'll follow ya.  You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones.  And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend. 
MR. WHITE We can't leave these guys with him. 
Meaning Mr. Blonde. 
EDDIE Why not? 
Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde. 
MR. WHITE Because this guy's a fucking psycho.  And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin me in the same room as this bastard. 
MR. BLONDE (to Eddie) You see what I been puttin up with?  As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah." 
MR. WHITE He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery. (to Mr. Pink) What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin tell him. 
MR. PINK He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store. 
MR. WHITE This is what he was doin. 
Mr. White acts out Mr. Blonde shooting everybody in the store. 
MR. BLONDE I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it.  I blew 'em full of holes.  If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive. 
MR. WHITE That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage? 
MR. BLONDE I don't like alarms. 
EDDIE What does it matter who stays with the cop?  We ain't lettin him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place. 
MR. PINK We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up. 
EDDIE There is no fuckin set up! (Eddie takes charge) Look, this is the news.  Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two.  White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.

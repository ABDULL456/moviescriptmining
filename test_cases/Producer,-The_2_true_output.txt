HE CLICKS HIS HEELS AND SHAKES HANDS WITH EACH OF THEM. 
LIEBKIND (to Bloom) Good luck. (to Bialystock) Good luck. 
HE STARTS INTO THEATRE, STOPS, TURNS BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM. 
LIEBKIND (a mad gleam in his eye) Tonight, New York.  Tomorrow, the world! 
HE TURNS TRIUMPHANTLY AND ENTERS THE THEATRE. 
OFF-CAMERA VOICE (GIRL) Check your hat? 
LIEBKIND (off camera) No!! 
BIALYSTOCK So much for Nutsy Fagin. 
BLOOM (nudging Bialystock, whispers) Here comes the Times Drama Critic. 
BIALYSTOCK Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin. 
BIALYSTOCK AMBLES OVER TO THE TIMES CRITIC, WHO HAS STOPPED TO CHAT WITH SOME PEOPLE. 
BIALYSTOCK Always delighted to see the gentlemen of the press.  There you are, sir.  Two on the aisle, compliments of the management. (he smiles unctuously) 
DRAMA CRITIC (haughtily accepting tickets) Thank you.  Here, wait a minute. There seems to be some mistake. There's a hundred dollar bill wrapped around these tickets. 
BIALYSTOCK (conspiratorially) It's no mistake.  Enjoy the show. 
DRAMA CRITIC (outraged) Mr. Bialystock, just what do you think you're doing? 
BIALYSTOCK I'm bribing you.  And if you play ball, there's a lot more where that came from. 
BIALYSTOCK WINKS AND SAUNTERS OFF. 
DRAMA CRITIC (blustering with rage) I... I... I... How dare he!  I've never been so insulted in my life! The gall of the man!  The incredible gall of the man!  I'll fix his wagon. 
THE CRITIC STALKS INTO THE THEATRE.  AS HE PASSES BIALYSTOCK, HE CONTEMPTUOUSLY FLINGS THE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL TO THE FLOOR.  HE DISAPPEARS THROUGH THE DOOR. 
OFF-CAMERA VOICE (GIRL) Check your hat? 
DRAMA CRITIC (off camera) No!! 
BIALYSTOCK REACHES DOWN, PICKS UP CRUMPLED DOLLAR BILL, STRAIGHTENS IT OUT, PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET. 
BIALYSTOCK (grinning like a Cheshire cat) Heh, heh, heh.  He'll kill us. 
FROM INSIDE THE THEATRE, WE HEAR THE OVERTURE BEGINNING. LIGHTS IN THE LOBBY BLINK. 
BLOOM Come on, they've started the overture. 
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER THE THEATRE. 
CUT TO REVERSE ANGLE.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTERING DARKENED THEATRE.  THEY TAKE POSITIONS AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE. BLOOM EXTENDS HIS HAND TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE INTENDS TO SPEAK IN A CONFIDENT AND CONTROLLED MANNER BUT WHAT COMES OUT IS AN HYSTERICAL SHRIEK. 
BLOOM (casually shrieking) Well, Max, this is it!!! 
HE SCARES HIMSELF AND QUICKLY CLAPS HIS HANDS OVER HIS MOUTH. 
BLOOM (whispers) I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous. 
BIALYSTOCK Relax, in two hours our worries will be over.

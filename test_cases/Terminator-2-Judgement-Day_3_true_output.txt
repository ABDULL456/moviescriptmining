Sarah and John have their weapons and supply selections laided out on two battered picnic tables for cleaning and packing.  Maps, radios, documents, explosives, detonators... just the basics.  Sarah is field- stripping and cleaning guns, very methodical.  There is no wasted motion. 
Not far away, John and Terminator are working on the Bronco.  They're greasy up to their elbows, lying on their backs under the engine compartment, ratcheting bolts into places on the new water pump. 
JOHN There was this one guy that was kinda cool. He taught me engines.  Hold this a second.  Mom screwed it up, of course.  Sooner or later she'd always tell them about Judgment Day and me being this world leader and that's be all she wrote. 
John thinks he's being causal, but his longing for some kind of parental connection is obvious. 
TERMINATOR Torque wrench please. 
JOHN Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad. 
TERMINATOR You will. 
JOHN Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt? (Terminator hands it to him) Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye. 
They crawl out from under the truck into the bright sunlight. 
TERMINATOR Why do you cry? 
JOHN You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts. 
TERMINATOR Pain causes it? 
JOHN Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it? 
TERMINATOR No. 
Terminator gets into the Bronco and turns the ignition key and the engine catches with a roar. 
JOHN Alriight!!  My man! 
TERMINATOR No problemo. 
John grins and does a victorious thumbs up. Terminator imitates the gesture awkwardly. John laughs and makes him get out of the truck, to try the move again. 
A108    SARAH, across the compound, pauses in her work to watch John and Terminator. 
A109    SARAH'S POV... we don't hear what John and Terminator are saying.  It is a soundless pantomime as John is trying to show some other gestures to the cyborg.  Trying to get him to walk more casually.  John walks, then Terminator tries it, then John gestures wildly, talking very fast... explaining the fundamental principles of cool.  They try it again.  Continued ad lib as we hear: 
SARAH (V.O.) Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly so clear.  The Terminator would never stop, it would never leave him... it would always be there.  And it would never hurt him, never shout at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it couldn't spend time with him because it was too busy.  And it would die to protect him.  Of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the years, this thing, this machine, was the only one who measured up.  In an insane world, it was the sanest choice. 
Sarah clenches her jaw and goes grimly back to work... a strong woman made hard and cold by years of hard choices. 
CUT TO; 
A110    EXT. ROAD - DAY 
A police cruiser is parked off the side of a quiet, empty road on the outskirts of Los Angeles.  A ribbon of traffic moves steadily by on a freeway in the distance.  Nothing stirs around the cruiser except some pump-jacks sucking the earth on the hill behind it. 
A111    IN THE CRUISER.  The T-1000 sits inside.  John's notes and letters are spread out on the seat beside it.  Sarah's voice speaks from a cassette deck.  John's tapes.  Her voices mixes with the static filled chatter of the radio that T-1000 monitors for any signs of its targets. 
SARAH ... if we are ever separated, and can't make contact, go to Enrique's airstrip.  I'll rendezvous with you there. 
T-1000 whips around and rewinds the tape, replaying the last section. It then snaps up the envelope of photos we saw earlier. 
ECU on envelope.  We see the postmark:  "Charon Mesa, Calif." 
TIGHT ON T-1000 staring at the postmark on the envelope.  It glances up at the sound of crunching gravel.  In the rear-view it sees a BIKE COP pulling onto the shoulder behind it.  The big KAWASAKI 1100 idles up next to the T-1000, still seated in the cruiser. 
BIKE COP Howdy.  I saw you pulled over here earlier. Everything okay? 
T-1000 Everything's fine.  Thanks for checking. (it gets slowly out of the car) Since you're here, though, can I talk to you a second... 
CUT TO: 
A112    EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY/MINUTES LATER 
The T-1000 thunders along on the Kawasaki 1100, doing about a hundred and twenty.  PAN WITH IT until it recedes toward the horizon. 
CUT TO: 
A113    EXT. COMPOUND - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON) 
Sarah sits at the picnic table.  The weapons are cleaned and her work is done.  She hasn't slept in twenty-four hours and she seems to have the weight of the whole world on her shoulder. She draws her knife from its belt sheath. Idly starts to carve something on the table top... the letter "N".

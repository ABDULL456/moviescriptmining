{"train": "Gone In 60 Seconds - Scott Rosenberg \nGONE IN 60 SECONDS by Scott Rosenberg \n\"I wonder,\" Toad said to himself presently, \"I wonder if this sort of car starts easily?\" Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he found that he had hold of the handle and was turning it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him, body and soul ... He increased his pace, and as the car devoured the street, he was only conscious that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and highest. And he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what might come to him... \" \n-- Kenneth Grahame, \"THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS\" \n\"All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood... \" \n-- Bruce Springsteen, \"THUNDER ROAD\" \nFADE IN: \nEXT. LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT \nThe streets are empty. Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew of a sky. It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal.  The vast Port of Los Angeles is visible in the b.g... No cars parked here ... No cars except - \nA '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 \nSilver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air scoops ... All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool before dawn ... An old-school totem to speed and style... And then SOMEONE approaches... \nThrough the mists of morning ... In leather coat and jack boots ... He's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer that refuses to fade ... \nThis is RANDALL RAINES, whom they call MEMPHIS - though know one's quite sure why ... But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern California ... \nMemphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe ... Like a desert crash survivor coming upon an oasis ... He walks around it ... Admiring it ... Adoring it ... \nBut then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him. Its driver - ATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for: \nATLEY JACKSON You gonna steal her or kneel down to her and pray -- ? \nMemphis looks at him, still enthralled... \nATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) I know, I know ... It's Eleanor ... Just take her, slick. - - \nAnd Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ... No one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his coat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the door ... \nWatch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another pocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION \nA RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small socket-like device - is pressed into the ignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles like a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds. \nHe takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the deck. Bruce Springsteen's \"Ramrod\" wails from the coaxials. And Memphis floors it... And off they tear... \nThe look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones, fixed and fumy ... \nHe slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in behind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ... \nOn they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort... \nExcept that, from seemingly out of nowhere -- \nA POLICE CAR \nappears behind them... \nAnd Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races through a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And Donny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their respective vehicles... \nThe UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny. \nDONNY Problem, Officer? \nPOLICEMAN Yes. You're under arrest -- ? \nDONNY For running a stop sign? \nPOLICEMAN For Grand Theft Auto - \nAnd off of Donny's look -- \nWe go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding toward him, sirens wailing... \nQUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning harbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music ... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ... \nMemphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis gutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy pursuit ... \nAnd now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson, heading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of cruisers himself ... \nMemphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up ahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so fast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ... \nGuns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and a PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on to the roadblock ... \nAnd, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake -- And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And Memphis takes the HARD LEFT ... \nAnd he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower Grand... Looking down ... \nHe can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being chased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER, the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ... \nLanding with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified. \nEXT. LOWER GRAND - LATER \nRescue team presence. Atley being hauled out of the wreck... His leg is a torn mess ... He's barely conscious... A cuffed Donny Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ... \nA POLICE CAR pulls up ... And out steps \nDETECTIVE ROLAND CASTLEBECK \nof G.R.A.B. The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau. Castlebeck is mid-50s, black, saturnine. - But don't let the tacit nobility fool you - the man's a street viper ... \nCastlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS.. \nHAWKINGS Astricky. And Jackson. No sign of Raines... \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Well, then it's all for naught, ain't it, Hawkings? \nTOM (O.S.) Uh ... Randall -- ? \nMEMPHIS Excuse me -- \nMemphis goes back into the garage, Budgy cackles. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RANCHO PALOS VERDES - BUSINESS DISTRICT \nA FORD ESCORT - driving through the upscale streets of Palos Verdes. Three KIDS, 20, inside ... The driver is FREB, a little dim; in the back is MIRROR MAN, black, always wears those mirrored shades ... In the passenger seat is \nKIP - Memphis' younger brother ... The car pulls to a stop. \nFancy stores - all of them closed - line this affluent business district ... Freb consults a piece of paper ... \nFREB The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia -- \nKIP He didn't mess up. There it is ... \nAnd he points ... To a CORNER BUILDING - EXOTIC MOTORS LTD. Twenty foot high glass - windows surround a SHOWROOM of EXOTIC DREAM CARS: Porsches and Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bertones ... And- there it is, a 1996 LOTUS ESPRIT V8, gleaming in the all-night showroom lights... \nFreb and Mirror Man are startled \nFREB That -- ? \nMIRROR MAN You're shittin', right? Kip? \nHe grins at them... He ain't shittin'... \nFREB How are we supposed to-- \nKIP Pop the trunk. I need my tool ... \nFreb scowls ... Pops the trunk ... Kip gets out ... Goes to the back ... Freb and Mirror Man share a spook -- \nMIRROR MAN What tool -- ? \nKip reaches into the trunk.... Comes around to them... He's carrying A BRICK -- \nMIRROR MAN (cont'd) Oh, no -- \nAnd Kip walks toward \"Exotic Motors\"... Calm and cool ... Ten feet from it ... He winds up ... And HURLS THE BRICK AT THE WINDOW Which EXPLODES ON IMPACT, a SHOWER OF GLASS raining down ... \nALARMS SQUEAL \nAs Kip walks into the showroom, glass crunching underfoot. Freb and Mirror Man can't believe it -- \nINT. EXOTIC MOTORS \nKip goes to the Lotus... With nary a glance around, he's got her open ... The Lotus' ALARM adds its song to the choir ... Kip, unmindful, gets behind the wheel ... Screwdriver to the mechanism... The alarm raging in here... \nIn moments, the V8's massive 349bhp is bellowing... And Mirror Man climbs in beside him... And off they go ... Laying several inches of English rubber. Over the broken glass and out of the showroom... \nEXT. CITY STREETS - PALOS VERDES - NIGHT \nThe Lotus races through these streets ... At high speeds ... \nMIRROR MAN Newsflash, Kip: you're driving a stolen car \nKip smiles over the ascending speedometer -- \nKIP Yeah. Ain't it great -- ? \nAnd he pins her ... VROOOOOM -- ! \nCUT TO: \nA TENNIS BALL \nbeing bounced against the wall ... Caught ... Bounced again ... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! \nINT. WAREHOUSE - LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT \nA dozen purloined AUTOS are parked here ... And a number of SHIPPING CONTAINERS ... A thuggish MAN reads the paper ... The tennis ball bouncer is TUMBLER, 20 ... And he's sitting on a tilted back chair, and wall-bouncing the ball and annoying the piss out of \nATLEY JACKSON \nwhom we remember from the drop-car at our opening ... Atley walks with a LIMP now... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! \nATLEY JACKSON Can you stop that, for Chrissake? \nTUMBLER What's your problem, bro ? \nThunk! Thunk! \nATLEY JACKSON Where are they -- ? \nTUMBLER They'll be here. You nervous, bro? You? Back in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in them veins ... What happened -- ? \nAnd Atley intercepts the tennis ball ... And hurls it over to the far side of the warehouse ... Tumbler merely grins ... \nTUMBLER (cont'd) Relax and enjoy -- \nEXT. SAN PEDRO STREETS - THE LOTUS \nHeading for Long Beach... Stopped at a light ... A CAMARO pulls up next to them... A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him... \nKip eyeballs them... Engines are revved... Challenges are implied... Mirror Man panics ... \nMIRROR MAN Stolen car, Kip. Stolen car, stolen car, stolen car ... \nKIP Stolen fast car... \nAnd the light turns green ... And he pops the clutch ... And they are off ... It's a good old fashioned drag race ... Kip smiles at the blonde ... Mirror Man is freaking out ... Kip's eyes are on fire ... He clocks the speedometer ... \nAtley takes a sip of his beer,... \nATLEY JACKSON He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad... \nMEMPHIS What kind of job... ? \nATLEY JACKSON A boost. A big boost ... \nMEMPHIS A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost? \nAtley frowns ... Looks at him... \nATLEY JACKSON You're shittin', right? \nClearly Memphis is not ... \nATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) Kip's become quite the little crewrunner since you left. He's been working a low-rent ring for two years now. You don't talk to your Ma? \nMEMPHIS It seems she neglected to mention it \nATLEY JACKSON Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you - \nMEMPHIS Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley... \nATLEY JACKSON The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense. \nMemphis takes a beat ... Sips at his brew ... Then: \nMEMPHIS Who was the job for? \nATLEY JACKSON Who do you think? \nMemphis waits ... In no mood for guessing games ... \nATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) Calitri, man. Raymond \"The Carpenter\" Calitri ... Your favorite and mine ... \nWhich means nothing to us ... Though the look on Memphis, face speaks volumes ... \nATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) I just thought you should know, man. I kind of had a feeling you didn't. But I should tell you: I'm working for him now - The Carpenter - so if you see him, you won't mention me coming to get you... Like I said: I just thought ... I owed you ... And that it was the right thing to do ... \nMemphis nods ... His face clenched in despair. We FADE TO BLACK, As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART 1: STOLEN MOMENTS \nWe PRE-LAP J. Geils Band's \"Hard-Drivin' Man\" and CUT TO: \nTHREE PLATES OF BACON, EGGS AND HASH BROWNS \nplaced on the service deck by a short-order COOK... \nINT. RUBY'S ALL-NITE - LONG BEACH - NIGHT \nA 24-hour diner in the heart of Long Beach... The three plates are picked-up with an impressive dexterity by \nHELEN RAINES \nearly 60s, clear-eyed... In pink Ruby's uniform and chunky shoes... Black currant hair striated with wisps of gray... Helen delivers the plates to a booth of college kids ... \nKID Can I get some more coffee -- ? \nHELEN RAINES Sure, hon ... \nAnd she goes to the coffee station... When \nMEMPHIS (O.S.) Who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna melt in this joint -- ? \nAnd she turns around to see Memphis standing there. Her expression displays many things ... Most of them joy ... \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) Hello, Ma -- \nAnd she goes to Memphis ... Wraps her arms around him ... Squeezes tight ... \nHELEN RAINES (cont'd) Oh, Randall ... \nShe takes his head in her hands ... Kisses his cheek ... Then the other... Hugs on ... Unmindful of the customers ... The cook smiles from behind the order wheel ... \nCOOK What's the word, Memphis -- ? \nMEMPHIS How ya doing, Ruby -- ? \nHELEN RAINES Come, come, come ... \nAnd she leads him over to a booth ... Barking to the cook - RUBY - on the way... \nHELEN RAINES (cont'd) Tuna melt on pumpernickel.  Provolone, extra tomato, Dijon... And a chocolate milk... Lots of syrup... (to Memphis) Right? \nMEMPHIS Right ... \nAnd they settle in ... Across the booth from each other ... She takes his hands... \nHELEN RAINES You look good... \nMEMPHIS You, too, Ma... \nHELEN RAINES What are you doing back? \nMEMPHIS How's Kip? \nAnd Helen flushes, a bit ashamed maybe ... \nHELEN RAINES Have you seen him? \nMEMPHIS No. \nHELEN RAINES oh. \nMEMPHIS Atley Jackson came to see me ... \nCALITRI I knew you'd say that, too -- \nCalitri smiles ... Memphis 'looks at him... At Atley Realizing the trap ... \nMEMPHIS Sound it out for me. \nCALITRI Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ... \nMEMPHIS And if he doesn't make it -- ? \nCalitri goes to one corner of the shop... Takes a tarp off of a full couch MAHOGANY CASKET... \nCALITRI I made this, too. My first one. Brass extension handles, not plated. The coverings are silk, not rayon. Expensive hardwood. And lined with spray green Lorraine crepe ... \nMemphis waits, knowing where this is going -- \nCALITRI (cont'd) Yes, yes. I made it for young Kip. In case he fails. At 8:00 Friday morning, if that ship sets off without my fifty ... Kip will take up permanent residence in this box ... \nCalitri WALL SWITCH and the a corrugated steel SLIDING DOOR is RAISED, revealing a LOADING DOCK facing the back of the yard... Two MEN are working out there... DIGGER AND BUTZ scuzzy dudes, mid-30s and dressed in dirty coveralls ... \nCALITRI (cont'd) Come here for a second, boys -- \nAnd they come over -- \nDIGGER Evenin', Mr. C. -- \nCALITRI Digger, Butz: let me introduce you to Randall Raines. Used to head up the dandiest ring in Southern Cal. Left us for parts unknown. Randall, this is Digger. And that's Butz - \nDIGGER Hi, Randall -- \nMemphis says nothing. Calitri grins ... Nods to Digger an Butz, who go back to work... \nCALITRI Digger and Butz will be in charge of burial. They're good boys ... \nMemphis' look is cold and furious ... Plaintive: \nMEMPHIS I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em... \nCALITRI \"don't want\" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things... \nAtley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut. Calitri turns to Memphis... \nCALITRI (cont'd) \"Nothing that's forced can ever be right.\" Old woodworking expression. I really don't care how the 50 get onto my ship ... I just care that they do. You decide. \nWith that, he puts his protective glasses back on - and fires up an abrasive-disc-finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and beginning to sand the Outside curve of an angled chamfer. \nEXT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nA small New England-style shingle and clapboard, up on a hill overlooking the port. A small GUEST-HOUSE behind it ... \nINT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE \nHelen clears away the dinner dishes ... The TV is on. The news. We see a CRIME SCENE ... \nREPORTER ... the car-jacking, which left Ramona Sullivan, the 44-year-old mother of three, dead, occurred last night at ... \nMemphis glances to the TV... Grimaces ... He looks out the window ... At the SEDAN parked below... \nEXT. RAINES' HOUSE - NIGHT \nMemphis comes out ... Moves to the sedan parked across the street ... it is Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff... \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I know you. \nMEMPHIS You know my back. \nThey get out of the car... The view of San Pedro from up here is a spectacular bedspread of lights ... \nDETECTIVE DRYCOFF When'd you get to town, Raines? \nMEMPHIS The other day.... \nDETECTIVE DRYCOFF What for? \nMEMPHIS No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ... \nDETECTIVE DRYCOFF Where you been, anyway? \nMEMPHIS Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ... \nDETECTIVE DRYCOFF You seem a little hinked-up ... \nMEMPHIS Not at all ... \nHe and Castlebeck lock eyes ... Castlebeck takes a pear from his coat pocket ... Sets to polishing it ... \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused... \nMEMPHIS A little family emergency -- \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I hope it's not your dear sweet mother... \nMEMPHIS No... \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Or your baby brother. What was his name? \nMEMPHIS Kip. \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ... \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd) I got a rash of thefts.  A new crew is making noise. We recovered a big take - last week... \nMEMPHIS And this has what to do with me? \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ... \nKIP Yeah ... \nMEMPHIS You all right -- ? \nKIP I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it - \nMEMPHIS Just hold-on there -- \nMemphis goes to the garage ... Finds a crowbar, an acetylene TORCH, tin-snips ... He goes back to the wrecked car... And sets to work... He looks at Kip ... Shakes his head... \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) So you want to run that part by me again about things being \"all sweetness and light...\" \nKIP This has nothing to do with any of that -- \nMEMPHIS Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ? \nKIP All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww... \nMEMPHIS Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there... \nIndeed... Memphis has freed him ... Kip crawls from the wreckage ... His clothes in tatters... Blood seeps from a variety of contusions ... He limps ... Memphis helps him to the guest house \nINT. KIP'S GUEST HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT \nSmall, cluttered... Posters of Kurt Cobain, a skying Kobe Bryant, Pamela Anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering Lamborghini Espada, etc. There's a fish tank... And a big-screen TV, on which the Lakers are currently defending a high-speed Boston Celtic fast-break... \nMemphis sits on a ratty couch before the TV... Kip comes out of the bedroom... He's changed clothes ... He wears clunky fur-lined MOON BOOTS, leopard-skin Speedos and a tshirt ... He looks slightly ridiculous... \nThroughout the scene, Memphis should be studying Kip, as if he's seeing him for the very first time ... And waiting for the inevitable crack... \nMEMPHIS You okay -- ? \nKIP Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ? \nMEMPHIS Sure -- \nAnd Kip limps toward the refrigerator ... He comes back with two beers ... Hands one to Memphis ... Glances at the TV -- \nKIP you like Kobe's game? I do. You think he's heir apparent to MJ? I do. He speaks fluent Italian, you know? So he's got that going for him -- \nAnd a cut on Kip's forehead starts to bleed ... Kip grabs a towel ... Presses it to his head -- \nMEMPHIS You sure you're okay -- ? \nKIP Yeah, man. Where is your beer? \nMemphis holds it up ... Kip nods ... There are a pile of IGNITIONS on the table ... Kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip it... \nKIP Cool. So you're living up North? \nMEMPHIS Yeah - \nKIP I heard you were pumping gas - \nMEMPHIS Something like that - \nKIP You're kind of cultivating a new look. \nMEMPHIS Yeah -- \nBeat ... They watch the game ... Kip replaces the soaked towel with another ... \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) Maybe you need a stitch -- \nKIP Nah. It's a scratch. \nMEMPHIS Okay -- \nBeat ... \nKIP Hey, you want something to eat ? \nMEMPHIS What do you got ... ? \nAnd Kip hoists himself painfully to his feet ... Limps over to the 'fridge ... Memphis watches him, a slight grin at Kip's attempt at cool ... Kip peers into the 'fridge ... \nKIP Not much. I got olives. You like olives? Kalamata olives rule, I think. Ma likes the Calabrese. It's more mellow \nAnd he brings over a bowl of olives. \nMEMPHIS There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive - \nKIP Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking -- \nAnd they nibble on them. Kip bites into one ... And the juice stings his cracked lip ... But he disguises his grimace as an appreciative nod... \nAnd for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an ashtray... Then: \nMEMPHIS So what are you gonna do? \nKIP About what? \nMEMPHIS \"About what?\" \nKIP About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ... \nMEMPHIS I can see that - \nAnd Memphis glances out the window. To the crushed car. Kip catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it. \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) You have everything ... under control? \nKIP Yeah. He just wants to know I'm still on it. He needs reassurance. All these big swinging dicks do. No worries. I won't let him get into our Kool-Aid... \nKip shrugs ... Picks up another olive... Remembers the pain' of the last one... Drops it back in the bowl ... Memphis is staring at him, disgusted... Kip feels it ... \nMEMPHIS Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on \nAtley nods... \nATLEY JACKSON Any idea how you're gonna go at it? \nMemphis looks at him... Shakes his head... FADE TO BLACK. \nAs a SUPER on-screen reads: PART II - BACK TO WRONG \nEXT.

Dig the 150 Merc, as its chrome is stripped off and the old paint sandblasted and holes brazed... \nAll under the watchful eye of... \nOTTO HALLIWELL \nLate 60s. A feisty grease-soaked curmudgeon who begs the question: how the hell did they manage to rock together Yoda and the ghost of Walter Huston... ? \nBut he remains the Zen master of cars and all that cars are, were and can be ... \nHis mixed-breed MUTT - Hemi - licks his balls in one corner \nOtto is currently AIRBRUSHING a candy-colored, variegated DESIGN on the deck lid of a Camaro ... It is painstaking work ... But he is an artist ... \nHis woman - JUNIE - a tall blonde, early 40s, body of a thousand dances, wipes his brow, like a scrub nurse ... \nMemphis wanders in... \nOtto sees Memphis ... Drops his brush... He walks over to Memphis ... Takes him in his arms ... Hugs him close... Actually waltzes him a few steps ... \nMemphis is stunned at the transformation this place has gone through ... \nOTTO Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell? (holds him at arm's length) And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ? MEMPHIS Hello, Otto ... \nOTTO You remember Junie? \nMEMPHIS Of course. Hi, Junie -- \nJUNIE Hello, Memphis - \nMEMPHIS What happened here -- ? \nOTTO Whatever do you mean? \nMEMPHIS The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins? \nOTTO What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to... \nHe calls over to the MEXICAN MAN working on the pick-up ... \nOTTO (cont'd) It's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black acrylic lacquer before laying out the flames ... And fill the cab top with mylar flakes ... They'll sparkle like stars ... (turns to Memphis) Randall, Randall, Randall ... You look splendid ... \nMEMPHIS You, too, Otto \nAnd Otto goes back to the Camaro ... To finish his work... \nOTTO I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ... \nMEMPHIS He's gotten involved -- \nOtto looks up frustrated... To Junie \nOTTO (O.S.) I can't concentrate. Play something, my sweetness; my reason to rise ... \nAnd Junie hits PLAY on a cassette deck ... And, instantly, ENGINE SOUNDS rip from the shop's stereo speakers ... Otto listens, as if it were a Mahler symphony... \nOTTO (cont'd) The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. At Le Mans. 1971. The quad-cam V12. Hear how they got the engine up? Hear those exhaust notes? That's a very wide rev range... Here, it peaks at 5500 RPM... \nMemphis smiles ... These eccentricities are old hat... \nOTTO (cont'd) Raymond Calitri. He's amplified much sorrow on these streets ... \nMEMPHIS You think it can be done? \nOTTO Are you considering a comeback tour? \nMEMPHIS Tell me... \nOTTO It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew... \nMEMPHIS The hard part ... \nOTTO \"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them...\" Nietzsche said that. \nMEMPHIS Is he still working here ? \nOTTO The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular - \nMEMPHIS I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me \nOtto has finished the Camaro ... He looks at Memphis -- \nOTTO I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ... \nMEMPHIS And the moral of that story is -- ? \nOTTO Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh... \nAnd he closes his eyes ... To listen to the Ferrari tape ... \nOTTO (cont'd) ... 8.8:1 compression... \nMemphis considers ... He has little choice ... \nMEMPHIS We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean \nKIP I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ... \nMEMPHIS You hear me? \nKIP I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand... \nMemphis looks at him... Shakes his head... \nDONNY ASTRICKY You guys have any skills at all? \nKIP Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ... \nMEMPHIS How old are you now, Toby? \nTOBY Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ... \nMemphis shakes his head... Sighs ... \nDONNY ASTRICKY (re: Freb) What about him? \nKIP Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business \nFreb starts to Protest ... Shrugs ... \nFREB People gotta eat ... \nMemphis looks at all of them ... Sighs... \nMEMPHIS Okay, then... Otto? \nOTTO In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And... \nTUMBLER One night? Are you nuts? \nMEMPHIS You got maybe a better plan? \nTumbler looks to Kip... \nKIP You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit \nMEMPHIS \"Shadow games?\" \nKIP Shadow games ... \nMEMPHIS You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail. \nKip and the others nod... Makes sense ... \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) Go on, Otto - \nOTTO We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew... \nDONNY ASTRICKY There's no one left ... \nOTTO We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ... \nMemphis looks at him. Because that's what he was afraid of. \nMIRROR MAN (to Otto) You know of one -- ? \nMEMPHIS Yeah. He's knows of one all right. \nSo we'll PRE-LAP The Beach Boys' \"409\" and CUT TO: \nINT. \"THE NAUTICAL MILE\" SALOON - NIGHT \nA SHOT GLASS, slammed down on a bar by a surly DRUNK... In a mariner saloon. Drunken SAILORS and FISHERMAN and NAVY TYPES. Sawdust on the floor. Broken beer mirrors. A rough joint... \nDRUNK One more, girl - \nThe BARTENDER comes over.. . She is a dark-haired, heavily tattooed GIRL, 26, with the faded blue world-weariness of Roy Orbison song... Her name is Sara Wayland... And she goes by SWAY. She collects the Drunk's empty glass... \nSWAY I think you've had enough, Billy... \nDRUNK Enough? I haven't even started, girl. Gimme another -- \nSWAY If you leave now, Billy, you can get a head-start on waking up in a pool of your own vomit... \nDRUNK Listen, you little cooze-- \nAnd the Drunk reaches out across the bar, to grab a bottle And Sway grabs his hand, twists it ... The Drunk groans in agony ... And Sway, still clutching his hand, hops over the bar ... And drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front ... Cries of \"Attagirl, Sway!\" pepper the air ... \nEXT. \"THE NAUTICAL MILE\" - NIGHT \nSway tosses him... The Drunk hitting the pavement ... \nSWAY Come back when you've learned how to drink, Billy -- \nAnd she freezes ... Because standing there, is Memphis ... She looks at him ...

And he follows her... \nINT. \"THE NAUTICAL MILE\" \nThey head toward the bar... \nSWAY (re: his clothes) What's with the look? \nAnd Memphis releases him... And Mitch goes down hard ... And Sway comes over ... \nSWAY What the hell are you doing -- ? \nMEMPHIS If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ... \nAnd he's out of there, before Mitch's PALS can get to him. \nMITCH Who was that guy, Sara? \nShe looks at the door ... Shrugs ... \nSWAY Good question ... \nINT. OTTO'S AUTO - LATER - NIGHT \nMemphis, Kip, Donny, Mirror Man and Otto sit around the garage ... Going through the list ... Tumbler calls from the next room: \nTUMBLER Freb's here. Open the gate. \nDONNY ASTRICKY (to Otto) We sent him out on a solo boost. See what he could do ... \nFreb pulls in an '89 Cadillac Coupe De Ville ... \nFREB How do I look in this one? \nMIRROR MAN Like a goofy white boy in a Cadillac. \nDONNY ASTRICKY How'd it go? \nFREB Keys were in it ... \nDONNY ASTRICKY Well, that defies the point, don't it? \nMIRROR MAN You should ask him how he got the name \"Freb.\" \nFREB Shaddup, man ... \nDONNY ASTRICKY Get the damn thing in there and get it cleaned up - \nFreb pulls in. Pops the trunk. The gate is closed. \nKIP This is loaded with crap - get a duffel. \nHe pulls out a set of golf clubs ... Freb brings over a duffel ... Mirror Man plucks something from the trunk ... \nMIRROR MAN (cont'd) Holy shit ... \nIt's a plasticine BAG - full of a WHITE POWDER... \nDONNY ASTRICKY Lemme see that - \nHe pierces the skin.. Tastes ... \nDONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) Heroin. \nKIP No shit? \nAnd they pull back the trunk tarp ... And there are perhaps TWO DOZEN similar smack-filled BAGS ... \nDONNY ASTRICKY There's gotta be a million bucks worth here - \nTUMBLER We're rich. Goddamn, we're rich! \nMEMPHIS Where'd you pick her up? \nFREB In front of one of them poker parlors in Chinatown ... \nMEMPHIS Well, take it back -- \nKIP Take it back? What do you mean take it back? Are you crazy, man? \nMEMPHIS Take it back, Freb -- \nMIRROR MAN Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man - \nDonny makes to grab the bag from Mirror Man ... But Mirror Man holds on ... They tug back and forth ... The bag DROPS ... Splitting on the ground, behind the car. Spilling heroin. \nMIRROR MAN (cont'd) Now, see what you-- \nBut a BANG! BANG! on the front gate, gives them all pause. \nOTTO Who is it -- ? \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (O.S.) Castlebeck. \nDONNY ASTRICKY Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded. \nOTTO one minute -- ! \nAnd the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and devices and lists. Leaving only Memphis and Otto. \nMemphis picks up the broken bag ... Sticks it in the trunk ... Puts the golf clubs in on top of it ... Slams the trunk. Only there's still a neat MOUNTAIN OF SMACK ON THE FLOOR by the rear of the Caddy ... But there's no time... \nFor the gate is opened. Detective Castlebeck ambles in. \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I know you. \nMEMPHIS You know my back. \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK What are you still doing here, Randall? \nMEMPHIS Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello. \nCastlebeck looks at Otto... Otto grins... Castlebeck walks around the garage... Taking it all in... \nMemphis and Helen look at him... Then: \nMEMPHIS After he died ... I think that's what I missed most of all ... That there was no different cars every night ... When I started hanging around Otto's ... And he started showing me the things ... It was a way to kill two birds ... Put food on the table for you and Kip ... And ... Ride in different cars every night ... Just like when Dad was here. \nTears stand in Helen's eyes ... Kip gets to his feet ... \nKIP Ancient history's two things. \"Ancient.\" And \"history!\" \nAnd he walks out of the house, door slamming behind him. Memphis turns to his mother ... \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma. \nHELEN RAINES I know... \nMEMPHIS We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all \nAnd she nods ... \nANGLE - A PHOTO. Robert Raines. Smiling beside an Olds 98. \nEXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS HIGH RISE CONDOS - DAY \nThe garage door opens as a resident drives out ... And Memphis and Donny and Kip and Toby enter the garage ... They walk along the rows of parked cars ... Searching ... \nDONNY ASTRICKY Car-jacking is the lazy man's boost. No skill. No finesse. Can only take the car if the key is in it. That's not thieving. That's parking ... Thugs ... With the decency of dirt ... \nTOBY They're just cars, man ... \nTo prevent Donny from biting the kid's head off, Memphis chimes in with: \nMEMPHIS This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now. \nTOBY Who's \"Eleanor?\" \nMEMPHIS The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500. \nTOBY Why do you call it \"Eleanor?\" \nMEMPHIS All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say \"Eleanor lives at such and such... \" and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ... \nDONNY ASTRICKY Eleanor is Memphis' \"unicorn.\" \nMEMPHIS And there she is -- \nIndeed, slotted nearby is a '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 Silver with black top ... \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) Hello, Eleanor -- \nAnd he looks at her. An old friend he hasn't seen in years. \nTOBY It looks just like a regular Mustang -- \nKIP Don't go there, Toby -- \nMEMPHIS She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ... \nTOBY So she flies - \nMEMPHIS She soars - \nDONNY ASTRICKY Grade-A unicorn ... \nTOBY What's a \"unicorn?\" \nDONNY ASTRICKY Fabled creature. You know - the horse with the horn? Impossible to capture? \nToby looks blank ... \nDONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) We all got one. The single car that, no matter how many times you try to boost, something happens... Cops show up, car doesn't start, owner comes back. It's voodoo... \nTOBY You guys and the car thing, man -- \nThey head off ... Memphis turns back to the Shelby \nMEMPHIS See you in a few days, Eleanor -- \nINT.

They stand before a locked MAZDA. \nMIRROR MAN And you just stick it in the lock. Hit this little button ... And ... \nHe does ... The door UNLOCKS ... The car's ALARM gives a weak chirp and dies... Otto looks at Donny ... \nOTTO We're dinosaurs, Donny. Pull-up a tar pit ... (to Mirror Man) Can I try -- ? \nMIRROR MAN Knock yourself out -- \nKip and Memphis are with Toby, who has his laptop out ... \nTOBY I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want. \nMEMPHIS So what's in there -- ? \nTOBY I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between \"FRIENDS\" and \"SEINFELD\"... \nMemphis nods ... Fairly impressed... \nKIP Good work, Toby -- \nDonny and Freb are inside the Caddy ... Freb's attempts to start it fail... \nThey carry pens and NOTEBOOKS ... And, as they drive around, they're searching out cars ... When they see an auto that corresponds to the list, they take down its license plate. \nMemphis dials the cell ... Mirror Man answers on the speaker in his van ... Tumbler in his ... We'll CROSS-CUT the scene as necessary from van to van ... \nMEMPHIS How's it going -- ? \nDONNY ASTRICKY It's arright ... \nThey drive on ... Till -- \nDONNY ASTRICKY (cont'd) Check it out: 173 Firebird. Know who drove one of those ... ? \nOTTO Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO... \nDONNY ASTRICKY That's being obscurest ... Who else?

You grew up \nTOBY Yeah, I'm cool ... \nAnd Memphis turns back to Kip, who's picked up a pool cue. \nKIP Who's got next game -- ? \nAnd he makes to rack 'em up ... Then: \nMIRROR MAN I get it. You ain't gotta be a genius: Memphis come back to save our bacon! \nTUMBLER Shut-up, Mirror Man -- \nFREB Izzat true? You come back to save our bacon? \nMIRROR MAN Of course it's true.

Although we do appreciate the gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled... And it was nice to see you -- - \nMemphis nods ... Looks at all of them... Smiles ... And then REACHES OUT, GRABBING Kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet and in close, nose to nose ... \nMEMPHIS You listen to me, baby brother. You fancy yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum, well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a poundcake. But I remember the days when you used to steal my Colorforms and eat 'em... So you can't stop me from saving your \"dangling ass' if that's what I feel like doing... \nAnd with that, he shoves Kip back down into his seat, toppling the table, bottles and glasses crashing...

Follows him into another room. Which is \nA WORKSHOP \nAn enormous WOODWORKING SHOP, fully tricked-out with state-of-the- art table saws and drill presses, jointers and power planes. \nAn antique treadle lathe stands in one corner. A stock layout of expensive woods - oak, birch, maple, cherry, mahogany - is stacked against the rear wall ... \nJars and bottles and cakes of glues, resins, stains and bleaches cram a shelf unit ... There's a MAN here, at a band saw. This is RAYMOND CALITRI, 59 ... \nHe wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer.

The liegelord of downtown... \n", "test1_true": "A BANK OF MONITORS on one wall show the cars being crushed and disassembled in the yard.

Oh, yes. Kip. \nMEMPHIS I don't want him hurt... \nCalitri looks at him, then waves a hand around the shop... \nCALITRI I'm proud of this work. The bird feeder. The wagon wheel planter. The dollhouse. The drop-leaf movable server... \nHe gestures to each item - exquisitely-rendered woodwork. Then gestures to the yard... \nCALITRI (cont'd) Metal. Steel. It's cold. Ugly. Wood is warm. Clean. Provided by nature. To see a piece of furniture take shape. It's like watching a child grow ... \nMemphis glances to Atley... Atley shrugs ... \nMEMPHIS I'm sure you're working your way to the point.  I'll wait right here ... \nCalitri blinks. Smiles. Nods... \nCALITRI My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them... \nMEMPHIS I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ... \nCALITRI Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ... \nMemphis nods, notes a PISTOL, resting on a shelf nearby. \nCALITRI (cont'd) No, no. You don't kill me, because you can't. You don't take your brother and run, because we'd find him. You don't go to the-police, because we have friends there, too. You do nothing: except deal with me. \nMemphis eyes him... \nMEMPHIS I can come up with the front money. Pay you back... \nCALITRI Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled... \nCalitri takes a manila ENVELOPE from his desk... Hands it to Memphis, who takes out the SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER inside. \nCALITRI (cont'd) On that list, you'll find fifty cars. Fifty. Five-zero. They range in age from the 1956 Ford Thunderbird to the 1999 Toyota Camry; and in expense from the 1993 Volkswagen Jetta to the 1988 Lamborghini Countach. Fifty cars. Five-zero. \nMemphis scans the list ... Looks up at Calitri ... \nCALITRI (cont'd) There is a container ship in Long Beach Harbor. Pier 14. Ready to be loaded with 4-car-per shipping containers, false-walled and customsprofiled as motor oil designated. The ship leaves in four days for South America and the men who've tendered me this contract ... \nMEMPHIS They gave you only four days? \nCALITRI They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ... \nMemphis scans the list ... \nCALITRI (cont'd) Four days. 50 cars.

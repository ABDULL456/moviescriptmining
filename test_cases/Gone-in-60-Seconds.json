As the familiar sound broke forth, the old passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him, body and soul ... He increased his pace, and as the car devoured the street, he was only conscious that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and highest. And he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what might come to him... \" \n-- Kenneth Grahame, \"THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS\" \n\"All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood... \" \n-- Bruce Springsteen, \"THUNDER ROAD\" \nFADE IN: \nEXT. LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT \nThe streets are empty. Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew of a sky. It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal.  The vast Port of Los Angeles is visible in the b.g... No cars parked here ... No cars except - \nA '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 \nSilver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air scoops ... All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool before dawn ... An old-school totem to speed and style... And then SOMEONE approaches... \nThrough the mists of morning ... In leather coat and jack boots ... He's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer that refuses to fade ... \nThis is RANDALL RAINES, whom they call MEMPHIS - though know one's quite sure why ... But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern California ... \nMemphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe ... Like a desert crash survivor coming upon an oasis ... He walks around it ... Admiring it ... Adoring it ... \nBut then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him. Its driver - ATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for: \nATLEY JACKSON You gonna steal her or kneel down to her and pray -- ? \nMemphis looks at him, still enthralled... \nATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) I know, I know ... It's Eleanor ... Just take her, slick. - - \nAnd Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ... No one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his coat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the door ... \nWatch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another pocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION \nA RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small socket-like device - is pressed into the ignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles like a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds. \nHe takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the deck. Bruce Springsteen's \"Ramrod\" wails from the coaxials. And Memphis floors it... And off they tear... \nThe look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones, fixed and fumy ... \nHe slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in behind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ... \nOn they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort... \nExcept that, from seemingly out of nowhere -- \nA POLICE CAR \nappears behind them... \nAnd Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races through a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And Donny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their respective vehicles... \nThe UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny. \nDONNY Problem, Officer? \nPOLICEMAN Yes. You're under arrest -- ? \nDONNY For running a stop sign? \nPOLICEMAN For Grand Theft Auto - \nAnd off of Donny's look -- \nWe go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding toward him, sirens wailing... \nQUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning harbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music ... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ... \nMemphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis gutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy pursuit ... \nAnd now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson, heading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of cruisers himself ... \nMemphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up ahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so fast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ... \nGuns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and a PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on to the roadblock ... \nAnd, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake -- And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And Memphis takes the HARD LEFT ... \nAnd he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower Grand... Looking down ... \nHe can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being chased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER, the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ... \nLanding with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified. \nEXT. LOWER GRAND - LATER \nRescue team presence. Atley being hauled out of the wreck... His leg is a torn mess ... He's barely conscious... A cuffed Donny Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ... \nA POLICE CAR pulls up ... And out steps \nDETECTIVE ROLAND CASTLEBECK \nof G.R.A.B. The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau. Castlebeck is mid-50s, black, saturnine. - But don't let the tacit nobility fool you - the man's a street viper ... \nCastlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS.. \nHAWKINGS Astricky. And Jackson. No sign of Raines... \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Well, then it's all for naught, ain't it, Hawkings? \nTOM (O.S.) Uh ... Randall -- ? \nMEMPHIS Excuse me -- \nMemphis goes back into the garage, Budgy cackles. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RANCHO PALOS VERDES - BUSINESS DISTRICT \nA FORD ESCORT - driving through the upscale streets of Palos Verdes. Three KIDS, 20, inside ... The driver is FREB, a little dim; in the back is MIRROR MAN, black, always wears those mirrored shades ... In the passenger seat is \nKIP - Memphis' younger brother ... The car pulls to a stop. \nFancy stores - all of them closed - line this affluent business district ... Freb consults a piece of paper ... \nFREB The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia -- \nKIP He didn't mess up. There it is ... \nAnd he points ... To a CORNER BUILDING - EXOTIC MOTORS LTD. Twenty foot high glass - windows surround a SHOWROOM of EXOTIC DREAM CARS: Porsches and Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bertones ... And- there it is, a 1996 LOTUS ESPRIT V8, gleaming in the all-night showroom lights... \nFreb and Mirror Man are startled \nFREB That -- ? \nMIRROR MAN You're shittin', right? Kip? \nHe grins at them... He ain't shittin'... \nFREB How are we supposed to-- \nKIP Pop the trunk. I need my tool ... \nFreb scowls ... Pops the trunk ... Kip gets out ... Goes to the back ... Freb and Mirror Man share a spook -- \nMIRROR MAN What tool -- ? \nKip reaches into the trunk.... Comes around to them... He's carrying A BRICK -- \nMIRROR MAN (cont'd) Oh, no -- \nAnd Kip walks toward \"Exotic Motors\"... Calm and cool ... Ten feet from it ... He winds up ... And HURLS THE BRICK AT THE WINDOW Which EXPLODES ON IMPACT, a SHOWER OF GLASS raining down ... \nALARMS SQUEAL \nAs Kip walks into the showroom, glass crunching underfoot. Freb and Mirror Man can't believe it -- \nINT. EXOTIC MOTORS \nKip goes to the Lotus... With nary a glance around, he's got her open ... The Lotus' ALARM adds its song to the choir ... Kip, unmindful, gets behind the wheel ... Screwdriver to the mechanism... The alarm raging in here... \nIn moments, the V8's massive 349bhp is bellowing... And Mirror Man climbs in beside him... And off they go ... Laying several inches of English rubber. Over the broken glass and out of the showroom... \nEXT. CITY STREETS - PALOS VERDES - NIGHT \nThe Lotus races through these streets ... At high speeds ... \nMIRROR MAN Newsflash, Kip: you're driving a stolen car \nKip smiles over the ascending speedometer -- \nKIP Yeah. Ain't it great -- ? \nAnd he pins her ... VROOOOOM -- ! \nCUT TO: \nA TENNIS BALL \nbeing bounced against the wall ... Caught ... Bounced again ... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! \nINT. WAREHOUSE - LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT \nA dozen purloined AUTOS are parked here ... And a number of SHIPPING CONTAINERS ... A thuggish MAN reads the paper ... The tennis ball bouncer is TUMBLER, 20 ... And he's sitting on a tilted back chair, and wall-bouncing the ball and annoying the piss out of \nATLEY JACKSON \nwhom we remember from the drop-car at our opening ... Atley walks with a LIMP now... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! \nATLEY JACKSON Can you stop that, for Chrissake? \nTUMBLER What's your problem, bro ? \nThunk! Thunk! \nATLEY JACKSON Where are they -- ? \nTUMBLER They'll be here. You nervous, bro? You? Back in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in them veins ... What happened -- ? \nAnd Atley intercepts the tennis ball ... And hurls it over to the far side of the warehouse ... Tumbler merely grins ... \nTUMBLER (cont'd) Relax and enjoy -- \nEXT. SAN PEDRO STREETS - THE LOTUS \nHeading for Long Beach... Stopped at a light ... A CAMARO pulls up next to them... A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him... \nKip eyeballs them... Engines are revved... Challenges are implied... Mirror Man panics ... \nMIRROR MAN Stolen car, Kip. Stolen car, stolen car, stolen car ... \nKIP Stolen fast car... \nAnd the light turns green ... And he pops the clutch ... And they are off ... It's a good old fashioned drag race ... Kip smiles at the blonde ... Mirror Man is freaking out ... Kip's eyes are on fire ... He clocks the speedometer ... \nAtley takes a sip of his beer,... \nATLEY JACKSON He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad... \nMEMPHIS What kind of job... ? \nATLEY JACKSON A boost. A big boost ... \nMEMPHIS A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost? \nAtley frowns ... Looks at him... \nATLEY JACKSON You're shittin', right? \nClearly Memphis is not ... \nATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) Kip's become quite the little crewrunner since you left. He's been working a low-rent ring for two years now. You don't talk to your Ma? \nMEMPHIS It seems she neglected to mention it \nATLEY JACKSON Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you - \nMEMPHIS Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley... \nATLEY JACKSON The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense. \nMemphis takes a beat ... Sips at his brew ... Then: \nMEMPHIS Who was the job for? \nATLEY JACKSON Who do you think? \nMemphis waits ... In no mood for guessing games ... \nATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) Calitri, man. Raymond \"The Carpenter\" Calitri ... Your favorite and mine ... \nWhich means nothing to us ... Though the look on Memphis, face speaks volumes ... \nATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) I just thought you should know, man. I kind of had a feeling you didn't. But I should tell you: I'm working for him now - The Carpenter - so if you see him, you won't mention me coming to get you... Like I said: I just thought ... I owed you ... And that it was the right thing to do ... \nMemphis nods ... His face clenched in despair. We FADE TO BLACK, As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART 1: STOLEN MOMENTS \nWe PRE-LAP J. Geils Band's \"Hard-Drivin' Man\" and CUT TO: \nTHREE PLATES OF BACON, EGGS AND HASH BROWNS \nplaced on the service deck by a short-order COOK... \nINT. RUBY'S ALL-NITE - LONG BEACH - NIGHT \nA 24-hour diner in the heart of Long Beach... The three plates are picked-up with an impressive dexterity by \nHELEN RAINES \nearly 60s, clear-eyed... In pink Ruby's uniform and chunky shoes... Black currant hair striated with wisps of gray... Helen delivers the plates to a booth of college kids ... \nKID Can I get some more coffee -- ? \nHELEN RAINES Sure, hon ... \nAnd she goes to the coffee station... When \nMEMPHIS (O.S.) Who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna melt in this joint -- ? \nAnd she turns around to see Memphis standing there. Her expression displays many things ... Most of them joy ... \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) Hello, Ma -- \nAnd she goes to Memphis ... Wraps her arms around him ... Squeezes tight ... \nHELEN RAINES (cont'd) Oh, Randall ... \nShe takes his head in her hands ... Kisses his cheek ... Then the other... Hugs on ... Unmindful of the customers ... The cook smiles from behind the order wheel ... \nCOOK What's the word, Memphis -- ? \nMEMPHIS How ya doing, Ruby -- ? \nHELEN RAINES Come, come, come ... \nAnd she leads him over to a booth ... Barking to the cook - RUBY - on the way... \nHELEN RAINES (cont'd) Tuna melt on pumpernickel.  Provolone, extra tomato, Dijon... And a chocolate milk... Lots of syrup... (to Memphis) Right? \nMEMPHIS Right ... \nAnd they settle in ... Across the booth from each other ... She takes his hands... \nHELEN RAINES You look good... \nMEMPHIS You, too, Ma... \nHELEN RAINES What are you doing back? \nMEMPHIS How's Kip? \nAnd Helen flushes, a bit ashamed maybe ... \nHELEN RAINES Have you seen him? \nMEMPHIS No. \nHELEN RAINES oh. \nMEMPHIS Atley Jackson came to see me ... \nHold the stare... The others are excited... \nFREB What are you doing back, Memphis? \nMEMPHIS Little visit. Check on the family. \nKIP It's nice to see ya, man - \nHe smiles ... Memphis eyeballs him... Toby is there ... \nTOBY Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ... \nMEMPHIS Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up \nTOBY Yeah, I'm cool ... \nAnd Memphis turns back to Kip, who's picked up a pool cue. \nKIP Who's got next game -- ? \nAnd he makes to rack 'em up ... Then: \nMIRROR MAN I get it. You ain't gotta be a genius: Memphis come back to save our bacon! \nTUMBLER Shut-up, Mirror Man -- \nFREB Izzat true? You come back to save our bacon? \nMIRROR MAN Of course it's true. He come to save his brother's dangling ass -- \nKIP That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving \nFREB We don't -- ? \nMEMPHIS He give you an advance -- ? \nMIRROR MAN Hell, yeah. Ten larger man \nKip shoots him a look... As if he's spoken out of turn ... \nMEMPHIS You just give 'im back the money. All's well... \nThe others look glum... Kip laughs ... Long and hard... \nKIP \"Give lim back the money.\" \"Give 'im back the money...\" Be nice. If only we didn't drink the money. And smoke the money. And buy Nikes with the money. And Sony Play Stations with the money. And dirty girls with the money... \nAnd Kip sinks a ball ... Memphis looks at the others ... They nod... It's true ... The money's gone ... \nKIP But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here... \nTUMBLER Things are all leafy and suburban ... \nMIRROR MAN The hell they are -- \nKIP Sure they are. Although we do appreciate the gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled... And it was nice to see you -- - \nMemphis nods ... Looks at all of them... Smiles ... And then REACHES OUT, GRABBING Kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet and in close, nose to nose ... \nMEMPHIS You listen to me, baby brother. You fancy yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum, well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a poundcake. But I remember the days when you used to steal my Colorforms and eat 'em... So you can't stop me from saving your \"dangling ass' if that's what I feel like doing... \nAnd with that, he shoves Kip back down into his seat, toppling the table, bottles and glasses crashing... And barrels away from them, the crowd parting like a wound... \nKip's crew left stunned, flustered, and maybe a bit impressed... \nTUMBLER Damn... Homeboy's on the dazzle ... \nAnd, off of Kip's furious look, we CUT TO: \nEXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT \nA chill in the air. Memphis walks toward a range of lowslung buildings ... \nEXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT \nA virtual cityscape of dismantled automobile carcasses, piled up high for as far as the eye can see ... A huge FORK LIFT scoops up a wreck and hauls it over to the CRUSHER... Watch as the car is FLATTENED, for easy shelving ... \nMidnight auto nonpareil ... To one side of the yard is a GARAGE: Watch as a HONDA ACCORD, with a BLOODY WINDSHIELD, enters the garage. A young Mexican KID driving. \nA SIGN: \"LOCK YOUR CAR OR IT MAY BE GONE IN 60 SECONDS!\" \nINT. GARAGE - CHOP SHOP \nA CAR is CHOPPED ... Pulled apart ... Fenders, doors, panels, interiors, air bags ... \nEXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - FRONT ENTRANCE \nMemphis knocks on the door ... A dog-faced MAN opens it ... \nDOG-FACE Yeah -- ? \nMEMPHIS Randall Raines to see Mr. Calitri ... \nINT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL \nMemphis follows Dog-face to the back of this building. Follows him into another room. Which is \nA WORKSHOP \nAn enormous WOODWORKING SHOP, fully tricked-out with state-of-the- art table saws and drill presses, jointers and power planes. \nAn antique treadle lathe stands in one corner. A stock layout of expensive woods - oak, birch, maple, cherry, mahogany - is stacked against the rear wall ... \nJars and bottles and cakes of glues, resins, stains and bleaches cram a shelf unit ... There's a MAN here, at a band saw. This is RAYMOND CALITRI, 59 ... \nHe wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer. A Richard Widmark motherfucker - with the diamond hard look of a cobra. The liegelord of downtown... \nCALITRI I knew you'd say that, too -- \nCalitri smiles ... Memphis 'looks at him... At Atley Realizing the trap ... \nMEMPHIS Sound it out for me. \nCALITRI Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ... \nMEMPHIS And if he doesn't make it -- ? \nCalitri goes to one corner of the shop... Takes a tarp off of a full couch MAHOGANY CASKET... \nCALITRI I made this, too. My first one. Brass extension handles, not plated. The coverings are silk, not rayon. Expensive hardwood. And lined with spray green Lorraine crepe ... \nMemphis waits, knowing where this is going -- \nCALITRI (cont'd) Yes, yes. I made it for young Kip. In case he fails. At 8:00 Friday morning, if that ship sets off without my fifty ... Kip will take up permanent residence in this box ... \nCalitri WALL SWITCH and the a corrugated steel SLIDING DOOR is RAISED, revealing a LOADING DOCK facing the back of the yard... Two MEN are working out there... DIGGER AND BUTZ scuzzy dudes, mid-30s and dressed in dirty coveralls ... \nCALITRI (cont'd) Come here for a second, boys -- \nAnd they come over -- \nDIGGER Evenin', Mr. C. -- \nCALITRI Digger, Butz: let me introduce you to Randall Raines. Used to head up the dandiest ring in Southern Cal. Left us for parts unknown. Randall, this is Digger. And that's Butz - \nDIGGER Hi, Randall -- \nMemphis says nothing. Calitri grins ... Nods to Digger an Butz, who go back to work... \nCALITRI Digger and Butz will be in charge of burial. They're good boys ... \nMemphis' look is cold and furious ... Plaintive: \nMEMPHIS I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em... \nCALITRI \"don't want\" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things... \nAtley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut. Calitri turns to Memphis... \nCALITRI (cont'd) \"Nothing that's forced can ever be right.\" Old woodworking expression. I really don't care how the 50 get onto my ship ... I just care that they do. You decide. \nWith that, he puts his protective glasses back on - and fires up an abrasive-disc-finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and beginning to sand the Outside curve of an angled chamfer. \nEXT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nA small New England-style shingle and clapboard, up on a hill overlooking the port. A small GUEST-HOUSE behind it ... \nINT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE \nHelen clears away the dinner dishes ... The TV is on. The news. We see a CRIME SCENE ... \nREPORTER ... the car-jacking, which left Ramona Sullivan, the 44-year-old mother of three, dead, occurred last night at ... \nMemphis glances to the TV... Grimaces ... He looks out the window ... At the SEDAN parked below... \nEXT. RAINES' HOUSE - NIGHT \nMemphis comes out ... Moves to the sedan parked across the street ... it is Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff... \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I know you. \nMEMPHIS You know my back. \nThey get out of the car... The view of San Pedro from up here is a spectacular bedspread of lights ... \nDETECTIVE DRYCOFF When'd you get to town, Raines? \nMEMPHIS The other day.... \nDETECTIVE DRYCOFF What for? \nMEMPHIS No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ... \nDETECTIVE DRYCOFF Where you been, anyway? \nMEMPHIS Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ... \nDETECTIVE DRYCOFF You seem a little hinked-up ... \nMEMPHIS Not at all ... \nHe and Castlebeck lock eyes ... Castlebeck takes a pear from his coat pocket ... Sets to polishing it ... \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused... \nMEMPHIS A little family emergency -- \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I hope it's not your dear sweet mother... \nMEMPHIS No... \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Or your baby brother. What was his name? \nMEMPHIS Kip. \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ... \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd) I got a rash of thefts.  A new crew is making noise. We recovered a big take - last week... \nMEMPHIS And this has what to do with me? \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ... \nKIP Yeah ... \nMEMPHIS You all right -- ? \nKIP I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it - \nMEMPHIS Just hold-on there -- \nMemphis goes to the garage ... Finds a crowbar, an acetylene TORCH, tin-snips ... He goes back to the wrecked car... And sets to work... He looks at Kip ... Shakes his head... \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) So you want to run that part by me again about things being \"all sweetness and light...\" \nKIP This has nothing to do with any of that -- \nMEMPHIS Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ? \nKIP All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww... \nMEMPHIS Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there... \nIndeed... Memphis has freed him ... Kip crawls from the wreckage ... His clothes in tatters... Blood seeps from a variety of contusions ... He limps ... Memphis helps him to the guest house \nINT. KIP'S GUEST HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT \nSmall, cluttered... Posters of Kurt Cobain, a skying Kobe Bryant, Pamela Anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering Lamborghini Espada, etc. There's a fish tank... And a big-screen TV, on which the Lakers are currently defending a high-speed Boston Celtic fast-break... \nMemphis sits on a ratty couch before the TV... Kip comes out of the bedroom... He's changed clothes ... He wears clunky fur-lined MOON BOOTS, leopard-skin Speedos and a tshirt ... He looks slightly ridiculous... \nThroughout the scene, Memphis should be studying Kip, as if he's seeing him for the very first time ... And waiting for the inevitable crack... \nMEMPHIS You okay -- ? \nKIP Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ? \nMEMPHIS Sure -- \nAnd Kip limps toward the refrigerator ... He comes back with two beers ... Hands one to Memphis ... Glances at the TV -- \nKIP you like Kobe's game? I do. You think he's heir apparent to MJ? I do. He speaks fluent Italian, you know? So he's got that going for him -- \nAnd a cut on Kip's forehead starts to bleed ... Kip grabs a towel ... Presses it to his head -- \nMEMPHIS You sure you're okay -- ? \nKIP Yeah, man. Where is your beer? \nMemphis holds it up ... Kip nods ... There are a pile of IGNITIONS on the table ... Kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip it... \nKIP Cool. So you're living up North? \nMEMPHIS Yeah - \nKIP I heard you were pumping gas - \nMEMPHIS Something like that - \nKIP You're kind of cultivating a new look. \nMEMPHIS Yeah -- \nBeat ... They watch the game ... Kip replaces the soaked towel with another ... \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) Maybe you need a stitch -- \nKIP Nah. It's a scratch. \nMEMPHIS Okay -- \nBeat ... \nKIP Hey, you want something to eat ? \nMEMPHIS What do you got ... ? \nAnd Kip hoists himself painfully to his feet ... Limps over to the 'fridge ... Memphis watches him, a slight grin at Kip's attempt at cool ... Kip peers into the 'fridge ... \nKIP Not much. I got olives. You like olives? Kalamata olives rule, I think. Ma likes the Calabrese. It's more mellow \nAnd he brings over a bowl of olives. \nMEMPHIS There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive - \nKIP Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking -- \nAnd they nibble on them. Kip bites into one ... And the juice stings his cracked lip ... But he disguises his grimace as an appreciative nod... \nAnd for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an ashtray... Then: \nMEMPHIS So what are you gonna do? \nKIP About what? \nMEMPHIS \"About what?\" \nKIP About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ... \nMEMPHIS I can see that - \nAnd Memphis glances out the window. To the crushed car. Kip catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it. \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) You have everything ... under control? \nKIP Yeah. He just wants to know I'm still on it. He needs reassurance. All these big swinging dicks do. No worries. I won't let him get into our Kool-Aid... \nKip shrugs ... Picks up another olive... Remembers the pain' of the last one... Drops it back in the bowl ... Memphis is staring at him, disgusted... Kip feels it ... \nMEMPHIS Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on \nAtley nods... \nATLEY JACKSON Any idea how you're gonna go at it? \nMemphis looks at him... Shakes his head... FADE TO BLACK. \nAs a SUPER on-screen reads: PART II - BACK TO WRONG \nEXT.

Hi, Junie -- \nJUNIE Hello, Memphis - \nMEMPHIS What happened here -- ? \nOTTO Whatever do you mean? \nMEMPHIS The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins? \nOTTO What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive.

These don't have to... \nHe calls over to the MEXICAN MAN working on the pick-up ... \nOTTO (cont'd) It's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black acrylic lacquer before laying out the flames ...

You look splendid ... \nMEMPHIS You, too, Otto \nAnd Otto goes back to the Camaro ... To finish his work... \nOTTO I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ... \nMEMPHIS He's gotten involved -- \nOtto looks up frustrated... To Junie \nOTTO (O.S.) I can't concentrate. Play something, my sweetness; my reason to rise ... \nAnd Junie hits PLAY on a cassette deck ... And, instantly, ENGINE SOUNDS rip from the shop's stereo speakers ... Otto listens, as if it were a Mahler symphony... \nOTTO (cont'd) The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. At Le Mans. 1971. The quad-cam V12. Hear how they got the engine up? Hear those exhaust notes?

He's amplified much sorrow on these streets ... \nMEMPHIS You think it can be done? \nOTTO Are you considering a comeback tour? \nMEMPHIS Tell me... \nOTTO It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew... \nMEMPHIS The hard part ... \nOTTO \"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them...\" Nietzsche said that. \nMEMPHIS Is he still working here ? \nOTTO The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular - \nMEMPHIS I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me \nOtto has finished the Camaro ... He looks at Memphis -- \nOTTO I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ... \nMEMPHIS And the moral of that story is -- ? \nOTTO Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh... \nAnd he closes his eyes ... To listen to the Ferrari tape ... \nOTTO (cont'd) ... 8.8:1 compression... \nMemphis and Helen look at him... Then: \nMEMPHIS After he died ... I think that's what I missed most of all ... That there was no different cars every night ... When I started hanging around Otto's ... And he started showing me the things ... It was a way to kill two birds ... Put food on the table for you and Kip ... And ... Ride in different cars every night ... Just like when Dad was here. \nTears stand in Helen's eyes ... Kip gets to his feet ... \nKIP Ancient history's two things. \"Ancient.\" And \"history!\" \nAnd he walks out of the house, door slamming behind him. Memphis turns to his mother ... \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma. \nHELEN RAINES I know... \nMEMPHIS We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all \nAnd she nods ... \nANGLE - A PHOTO. Robert Raines. Smiling beside an Olds 98. \nEXT.

An old friend he hasn't seen in years. \nTOBY It looks just like a regular Mustang -- \nKIP Don't go there, Toby -- \nMEMPHIS She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ... \nTOBY So she flies - \nMEMPHIS She soars - \nDONNY ASTRICKY Grade-A unicorn ... \nTOBY What's a \"unicorn?\" \nDONNY ASTRICKY Fabled creature.

And behind him, another Calitri GOON... And, finally, Calitri himself stands there. Someone kills the music. They all look at him...

A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ... \nOTTO So saith the God of Scumbags -- \nCALITRI Hello, Otto. My boys at the dock report no cars have yet to be delivered. And there's only one more night ... \nOTTO Getting nervous, Ray? What happens to you, I wonder, if delivery isn't made? \nCalitri ignores him...

This is the grand-daddy of chase scenes here, so we won't take the easy way out. We'll actually script it ... Memphis races out onto the busy street, Drycoff on his ass. \nDrycoff pulls up alongside him... So they can see him. But the wig and moustache prevent them from recognizing Memphis ...

Suspect is headed southbound on Mount Vernon, at Cambridge Street -- \nThe cops look at each other. Holy shit! And race for the exit. Because Mt.

And Memphis has just arrived... \nMEMPHIS Shit ... \nWatch the mad scramble as COPS dive into their units... And try to get out of each other's way... Fenders crunch ... Cops curse.

Ramp down ... Memphis rockets Eleanor at the ramp truck's ramp... Straight on ... And the ramp LAUNCHES ELEANOR in glorious super-sexy-bloodpumping SLO-MO OVER THE ACCIDENT SITE some thirty feet in the air ...

You're free to go ... \nMemphis can barely believe it. Castlebeck leans down, to Kip: \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd) Your brother's a clever man and a talented thief, Kipling. But as role models go, you should observe the man, not the thief ... \nKIP Yes, sir ... \nCastlebeck sighs... \nMEMPHIS Don't look so glum, Detective. It's a beautiful day, the birds are singing, and there's a container ship on Pier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee ... \nCastlebeck nods ... \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I want you gone, Randall.

The boys are huddled together... \nMIRROR MAN Poor Toby, man... \nA few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly: \nTHE SPHINX If his premature demise has, in some way, enlightened the rest of you as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired you to change your ways, then his death carries with it an inherent nobility. And a supreme glory. We should all be so fortunate. You can say 'Poor Toby.\" I say: \"Poor us..\" \nThey all stare at him, stunned... \nFREB You spoke \n", "test1_input": "Memphis considers ...

Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail. \nKip and the others nod... Makes sense ... \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) Go on, Otto - \nOTTO We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew... \nDONNY ASTRICKY There's no one left ... \nOTTO We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ... \nMemphis looks at him. Because that's what he was afraid of. \nMIRROR MAN (to Otto) You know of one -- ? \nMEMPHIS Yeah.

Beat ... \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) You look great -- \nSWAY Yeah, well, you always were a sucker for flawed existences ... \nANGLE - MITCH. Watching them talk ... \nSWAY (cont'd) You should leave -- \nMEMPHIS On account of Mitch? \nSWAY On account of me. \nHe studies her... Then: \nMEMPHIS I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ? \nSWAY No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember? \nMEMPHIS I left town. I didn't leave you. \nSWAY A distinction worth noting ... \nMEMPHIS And here I am... \nSWAY Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part - \nMEMPHIS Kip's in trouble \nAnd now she looks concerned \nSWAY What kind of trouble -- ? \nMEMPHIS Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared. \nSWAY And you got some Italians -- ? \nMEMPHIS Six or seven... \nSWAY I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself.

Mitch's face curls ... \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) Is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted face? Agonized and writhing and ugly? Oh, now I see it, yes, yes! \n", "test1_id": 1359, "test2_input": "And Memphis releases him... And Mitch goes down hard ...

Goddamn, we're rich! \nMEMPHIS Where'd you pick her up? \nFREB In front of one of them poker parlors in Chinatown ... \nMEMPHIS Well, take it back -- \nKIP Take it back?

The whole damn thing's loaded. \nOTTO one minute -- ! \nAnd the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and devices and lists. Leaving only Memphis and Otto. \nMemphis picks up the broken bag ... Sticks it in the trunk ... Puts the golf clubs in on top of it ... Slams the trunk. Only there's still a neat MOUNTAIN OF SMACK ON THE FLOOR by the rear of the Caddy ... But there's no time... \nFor the gate is opened. Detective Castlebeck ambles in. \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK I know you. \nMEMPHIS You know my back. \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK What are you still doing here, Randall? \nMEMPHIS Stopped by to see Otto.

There's no want on the license at this time... \nCastlebeck looks disappointed... Otto grins ... Castlebeck stares at the Caddy, still unconvinced... \nMEMPHIS You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ? \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Something like that - \nMemphis opens the driver's side door ... Gestures Castlebeck in ... Castlebeck gets behind the wheel ... \nMEMPHIS Let her rip ... \nAnd Castlebeck starts the car... \nANGLE - TAILPIPE ... WHOOSH! All of the heroin on the flo is blown away by the exhaust ... Memphis winks to Otto ... Castlebeck seems satisfied ... Gets out. \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ... \nOTTO Double-meaning intended, right? \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK Right ... \nCastlebeck stops at the gate... Turns back to them... \nDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ... \nMEMPHIS I don't think so, Detective ... \nAnd Castlebeck is gone. Memphis and Otto exhale big time..

Outside a car dealership. We can almost feel his strong, sure presence ... \nMemphis looks at his mother ...

In her greasy coveralls, hair tied back, a motorhead's dream girl ... \nSWAY Hey. \nMEMPHIS What's wrong with her -- ? \nSWAY The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno... \nAnd she goes to the sink... \nSWAY (cont'd) You know Annie's trouble \nMEMPHIS Annie -- ? \nSWAY You haven't been studying -- \nShe gestures to where the LIST of 50 is on the counter. \nSWAY (cont'd) 137 Roadster. Custom. Lives at 1443 Locklin in Rancho Palos Verdes ... \nMEMPHIS Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself \nSWAY She was the only \"Annie\" you could find? \nMEMPHIS They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area... \nSWAY Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ... \nAs she speaks we CUT TO: \nEXT. 1443 LOCKLIN - RANCHO PALOS VERDES - DAY \nA massive house of glass and steel in a fancy neighborhood. We MOVE FOR THE HOUSE. Over the fine-trimmed lawn. \nSWAY (O.S.) ... and he keeps \"Annie' in his living room... Like a work of art ... \nINTO THE SPARTAN LIVING ROOM... \nMassive framed Lichtenstein and Haring pieces on the wall ... Surround the yellow ROADSTER, which sits up on a platform ... Check out JUDGE CROFT, a nasty fat man in his late 50s ... He sits in the nearly empty room... A complex system of directional lighting illuminates the Roadster \nSWAY (O.S.) She's got 27 miles on her o-dom. Which is exactly how far away the custom shop was in 1979 when he bought her... He drove her home, never drove her again ... \nThe judge gazes at the car, admiring its jet-pod taillamps... A MAID comes in with a tray of tea service ...

TEN-TON TRANSFER COMPANY - FRONT GATES \nA huge trucking company warehouse. Kip gets out. Bolt-cuts the chain-fence out front. \nAnd Memphis drives on in, passing the long rows of gargantuan CAR CARRIERS here. He picks one ... \nMEMPHIS This one ... \nHe slim-jims the door ... But the ALARM goes off ... A wild whooping alarm ... Deafening... Try as he might, he can't get it off. He pops the trunk. Looks for wires ... Nothing. \nThen, at once, it goes off. Memphis turns. Kip is there. He holds a little DEVICE. \nMEMPHIS (cont'd) What's that thing -- ? \nKIP Reads the infrared. Then kills it.

The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze.

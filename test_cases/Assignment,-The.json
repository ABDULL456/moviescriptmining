Admiral Trost was so pissed he was ready to shell the port of Haifa. \nJack, however, isn't sniggering. He's thinking hard as he looks at all the information on the desk. \nJACK You're not gettin' it are ya? \nSCOTT What? \nJACK These weren't some yokels... This was the Israeli General Security Service... The Mossad. The best in the business. They have the most complete dossier there is on Carlos, the latest pictures of him... everything. I mean what's that tell you? \nSCOTT That they really ate it this time. \nJACK Scott... doesn't it hurt to walk around like that with your head up your ass... I mean isn't it painful? \nHis eyes glance down to the pictures, especially the photos of the children. Something begins to click. \nEXT. NORFOLK, VA - DAY \nSUPER: NORFOLK, VIRGINIA \nEXT. T-BALL FIELD - NORFOLK, VA - DAY \nAlmost nothing is as cute as 3 foot 5 inch 6-year-olds struggling to play the most elementary form of baseball, T- ball. \nANGLE ON - 6 - YEAR-OLD JOEY RAMIREZ \nHe is the first baseman and he is intent upon the batter who stands at the T. \nANGLE ON - THE PARENTS \ncheering their kids on. Amongst them we recognize MAURA, Annibal Ramirez's wife, who is cheering for her son's team. She holds a ten month old baby as she cheers. \nNEW ANGLE \non Annibal Ramirez, resplendent in his summer whites, his face still showing the faintest remnants of bruises at the hands of the Israelis. He holds his sea bag in his hand. There is a waiting taxi behind him as he strides over towards the baseball diamond. \nANGLE ON - JOEY \nHe sees his father just as the batter hits the ball. \nJOEY Poppi! \nThe pitcher scoops the grounder up and tosses it to Joey whose eyes however have lit up at the sight of his sailor father home from the sea so the ball hits him in the side of the head and he goes down. Ramirez wants to rush out to his son, but Joey straightens himself up quickly, not wanting to be embarrassed by an over-protective parent. \nANGLE ON - MAURA AND RAMIREZ \nMaura has followed her son's gaze at Ramirez and feels no embarrassment whatsoever as she runs into his arms, still holding her baby. She kisses him. \nMAURA I thought you weren't coming back till tomorrow... \nRAMIREZ I wanted to be here for his game. Look how beautiful she is! \nHe picks up the baby and kisses her. \nRAMIREZ Just like her mother. \nMAURA What happened to your eye? \nRAMIREZ Nothing. Just fell. It doesn't matter. I'm home. \nEXT. RAMIREZ'S HOUSE - NORFOLK - A MONTH LATER - DAY \nIt's a stucco, single-level structure in a clean, middle income neighborhood. Jack Shaw pulls up, crosses out of his car and knocks on the door. The door opens revealing Ramirez in a T-shirt and pair of sweats. Jack looks at his face, the unmistakable face of Carlos. \nRAMIREZ Joey watch Yolanda... okay? \nJACK Jesus... \nRAMIREZ I beg your pardon? \nJACK Lieutenant Commander Ramirez my name is Jack Shaw... I'm with the government... I'd like to talk to you about what happened in Israel. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RAMIREZ HOUSE - BACKYARD - NORFOLK - DAY \nANGLE - CLOSE ON \nthe barbeque's coals which burst into flame as fluid and then match are applied. OVER this we hear \nRAMIREZ I want to sue them, okay? I want to sue the guy who broke my ribs. I want to sue their government and their Mossad... and I want to sue Golda Meir! \n", "test1_true": "They stand at the barbeque as Joey plays shooting hoops. Ramirez holds Yolanda. Ramirez and Jack speak quietly. \nJACK Mrs. Meir is dead, Lieutenant Commander. \nRAMIREZ Then you might want to have them dig her up because I intend to sue her. \nJack chuckles. \nJACK Commander Ramirez when I said I was from the government, perhaps I should have been more specific. I'm from the CIA. \nJack reaches down, opens his briefcase and pulls out a large photo album-like briefing book. He opens it up and hands it to Ramirez. On the first page there is an 8\u00d710 enlargement of a photo of Carlos entering a building. It is grainy but it certainly looks exactly like Ramirez. \nJACK Does the man in that picture look familiar? \nRamirez looks at the picture with the same look on his face that Jack had when he saw Ramirez for the first time. \nYOLANDA Poppi... \nRAMIREZ That's not me... I mean I know it looks like me... but... \nJACK I know it's not you. \nRAMIREZ It's... this Carlos guy. \nJust then, Joey yells from the tree he's in. Jack automatically hides the picture as if the kid were from a rival intelligence agency. \nJOEY Poppi, you don't need to watch the fire, come climb with me. \nRAMIREZ Get out of that tree, Joey. Your mother sees that and I'm dead. \nNow when Jack speaks it is more guarded and in even quieter tones. \nJACK This is the only recent shot we have of him... telescopic lens from half a mile away taken by the Israelis. Can you blame 'em for what happened? The only difference is the eyes. \nRamirez looks at the picture in shock at the resemblance. \nRAMIREZ Okay I get it now, you're here to talk me out of my lawsuit. But see I identified myself but they kept me in that cell for two more days chained to that wall after I told 'em who I was so... \nJACK Lieutenant Commander, I am not here about your lawsuit. Carlos is the single most vicious terrorist in the world. He's personally carried out or masterminded the worst terrorist attacks in modern history. Men, women, children. Children like yours... blown to bits or slaughtered in cold blood. Annibal... why did you join the Navy? \nRAMIREZ (as if by rote) To serve my country. \nJACK To serve your country... to protect her from her enemies. Well Carlos is one of her enemies now. And he'll probably become a bigger one... terrorism... unfortunately is a growth industry. \nRAMIREZ Why are you telling me all this? \nJACK Lieutenant Commander, the governments of most countries in the free world have been after Carlos for ten years and we have nothing to show for it. There is exactly one person in the world who can help us get Carlos. And that person is you. \nRAMIREZ What do you mean... to get him? \nJACK All I can tell you is it may take as much as six months to a year of preparation. It will involve a high degree of risk. That much said, you may never as much as lay eyes on him yourself. But if we succeed Carlos won't be a threat to anyone anymore. Now I know you're going to need some time to think about it so... \nRAMIREZ No I don't need any time. The answer's no. \nJACK Annibal... \nRAMIREZ Lieutenant Commander... I am a Naval Officer... that's what I was trained for... that's what I'm good at... See you came to the wrong address. You want James Bond. He lives in London and he's got an Aston Martin. You can't miss him. \nWe HOLD on Ramirez's look and Jack's half-smile. \nINT. OFFICERS' CLUB - NAVAL BASE - NORFOLK - EVENING \nThe Officers' Club is decked out for a reception for ADMIRAL CRAWFORD. All the officers are in dress whites and all the wives wear white gloves and cocktail dresses as a Navy string quartet plays softly in b.g. There is a reception line and the Admiral stands with his aide who introduces each of the guests who pass through the line. \nNAVAL AIDE Admiral Crawford this is Commander and Mrs. Ward Scowcroft. \nCRAWFORD I know your family well, Commander, I was with your father at the Academy. I expect great things from you Ward... great things. \nSCOWCROFT I won't let you down sir. \nNext up are Ramirez and his wife Maura. \nNAVAL AIDE Admiral Crawford this is Lieutenant Commander and Mrs. Annibal Ramirez. \nCRAWFORD Annabelle?! \nRAMIREZ (smiling) It's Annibal sir. \nCRAWFORD Yes... of course... well ... I'm glad to see we're getting some Mexican American officers in the ranks. I'm an L.A. boy myself so I have a real soft spot for authentic Mexican food... My stomach doesn't always go along with it but... \nMAURA We'd love to have you over to dinner Admiral but the cuisine would be Cuban not Mexican. I think your stomach would find it more agreeable... not to mention your taste buds. \nCRAWFORD You're Cuban Americans... oh I'm sorry... you grow up in L.A. and you hear Ramirez and... anyway it was a pleasure meeting you. \n", "test1_id": 2430, "test2_input": "Ramirez says nothing. \nAMOS Carlos is the opposite of that and that's what's so seductive, you know? He can kill whomever he chooses... ravish whoever he chooses... take whatever he chooses. Do... whatever he chooses. It is to be in many ways a superman, not bound by the mores or morals of humanity. \nJACK And if you learn what we can teach you, you'll be one, too. If not, you'll be dead. \nINT. ABANDONED PRISON - CAFETERIA - THE NEXT MORNING \nIt is a huge, empty room. Ramirez sits at the lone table as Amos enters. Ramirez is eating a bowl of porridge. His breath steams out in the cold. The room is freezing but instead of a warm jacket, he wears light prison overalls. \nAMOS Good morning. How's the porridge, you like it? \nRAMIREZ 'Morning. It's not bad. \nHe finishes what's left in the bowl. Amos reaches over to a side warming table. There is a huge pot of porridge there. \nAMOS Good... finish everything in the pot. \nRAMIREZ There's got to be like... eight helpings in there maybe... \nAMOS No questions... Just do. \nFrom now on, unless otherwise indicated Ramirez is in the too-tight shirt and tie and light jacket. \nJack is in the distance, observing. \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ABANDONED PRISON - DAY \nRamirez is doing furious situps, hanging off the balcony of one of the tiers, with his feet linked under one of the bars so that as he does his sit-up it is over an abyss. Amos stands in front of Ramirez, puffing on a cigar as he speaks, so that Ramirez is gulping in breaths of cigar smoke as he exercises. \nAMOS Name and place of birth! \nRAMIREZ Illich Ramirez. Caracas, Venezuela. \nAMOS Your father? \nRAMIREZ Doctor Jose Altagracia Ramirez... Do you have to smoke that cigar? \nAMOS Yes. \nThere is a silence between them. This is obviously the end of that subject. Then Amos goes on. \nAMOS Carlos' father abandoned him and his mother because he wanted to be a playboy. Your father abandoned you in effect, when he was sent to prison. Either way, it's a lonely child missing his father. I want you to take what you know of your real father and superimpose it onto this the image of Carlos' father, so when you talk of one you are talking of the other with the same emotion... the same love, the same resentment... the same sadness, the same anger. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CEMETERY - MONTREAL - DAY \nAs Jack and Ramirez walk toward the cemetery, we SEE Ramirez who wears a lightweight white parka so that he shivers in the cold in contrast to Jack's heavy winter gear. Ramirez carries what appears to be a gun. \nJACK You need to not only remember the names on every tombstone, but where they are so when I call out a name, you whirl and shoot. \nThey walk into a scene that is completely surreal. Standing behind every tombstone is one of the crew of trainers. \nEach man wears a white parka and white pants against the freezing cold. In the center of their impromptu circle stands Ramirez, also wearing white, but of much lighter material so that he shivers in the cold. All of them including Ramirez hold paint pellet guns. It is a cemetery full of living targets which can shoot back. Jack stands outside the circle. \nRAMIREZ It's kind of cold. You think I might be able to borrow a warmer jacket from someone? \nJACK Brisson! We don't want you to be comfortable. That's just what will get you killed. \nRamirez hesitates a moment, trying to remember where the tombstone with the name \"Brisson\" is. The trainer who stands behind the \"Brisson\" tombstone has no such hesitation. He fires at Ramirez and an ugly black splotch of paint explodes on Ramirez's white suit. Ramirez shakes his head in frustration. \nJACK DuPres! Paquet! \nRamirez whirls, misses one, is hit again with another black splotch but hits the Paquet tombstone square in the chest with a black splotch of his own. \nINT. KITCHEN SET - PRISON - DAY \nIn the middle of a huge room, a movie set has been erected. There are flats supported by sand bags which form the \"set\" of a kitchen. The set is perfect in every way but its position inside of a huge prison hall lends a quality of the macabre, since no movie is being shot here and no audience will ever see these performances. Jack is there with Ramirez. He opens the refrigerator and Ramirez looks inside as Jack times him on his watch, then closes the refrigerator. Ramirez sneezes. He has caught a cold but must ignore it. \nRAMIREZ Top shelf... some milk, some juice, maybe some cottage cheese, a couple bottles of beer, some tomatoes... I don't know... \nJACK What kind of milk, how many cartons, open or closed, what kind of juice, how full was the bottle, was it cottage cheese or cream cheese, how many bottles of beer, how many tomatoes? This is life and death! \nJack opens the cupboard. \nJACK Look here... Ten seconds, how many cups, saucers, plates, look this time! \nINT. CAFETERIA - ABANDONED PRISON - MONTREAL - DAY \nRamirez sits practicing his Venezuelan accent in English, repeating phrases he hears from a native speaker on a tape recorder as he eats another of the interminable bowls of porridge. \nEXT. CEMETERY - MONTREAL - DAY \n", "test2_true": "JACK Here's the thing about Carlos. He doesn't fit any mold. His father is an extraordinarily wealthy playboy who's a Marxist at the same time... DuFraisne! \nRamirez whirls and misses and is hit by the trainer. Jack shakes his head and continues. \nJACK The guy's such a fanatic he names his three sons after Lenin. And I don't mean John. The same thing is true for Carlos. He's a guerilla fighter who loves champagne and caviar... LaPierre! \nRamirez whirls and hits the trainer in his shoulder at the same time that he himself is hit. Jack's look betrays no emotion. \nJACK He doesn't want to be Che Guevara, he wants to be the James Bond of the People's Liberation Front. It's not so much radical chic as an excuse for sadism. Paquet! \nAs he says this last, Ramirez whirls and shoots another trainer, dead in the chest. Ramirez smiles. He is beginning to enjoy playing terrorist. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY \nWe are speeding down the road in a suped-up open Jeep POV Ramirez, who is driving. Suddenly, we SEE Jack and Amos up ahead. Amos pulls a lever and a barrier snaps up at chest level across the road. We jam on the brakes and \nCUT TO: \nINT. JEEP - DAY \nRamirez is at the wheel. Suddenly he sees the barrier plate a hundred yards in front. He hits the brakes and the emergency brake at the same time. \nNEW ANGLE \nThe tires scream and leave black tracks, as the Jeep slides sideways towards the barrier. Just before reaching it, the car completes a 180-degree turn and roars back, but at the last second fishtails and swerves off the road. \nANGLE ON - RAMIREZ \nHe is obviously frustrated. \nANGLE ON - JACK \nHe shakes his head in disgust. \nJACK Dead again. \nEXT. BELVEDERE - DAY \nRamirez and Jack walk together on the belvedere which is an observation area with a railing around it, overlooking the abandoned prison. In between the belvedere and the prison is a field which is almost completely barren except for one tree. It sits down below. \nIn the distance, we SEE a snow mobile approach with its lights on. Just then, Jack takes a pocket sized remote transmitter and slips it into the front pocket of Ramirez's jacket, turning it on as he does. \nRAMIREZ What's that? \nJACK It's a transmitter. \nRAMIREZ For what? \nJACK Target practice. You're the target. \nJack quickly moves away from Ramirez. As Ramirez moves, he notices that the snow mobile changes direction as well, and continues to home in on him. And then there is a second snow mobile. And then a third, all of them coming straight for him. He starts to run. The snow mobiles turn and continue bearing down on him, driving him closer toward the railing. We SEE the snow mobiles are controlled by radio antennas, evidently homing in on his transmitter. \nJack, who has moved quite a ways off, pulls out a Beretta and sets it on the rail. We SEE on the snow mobiles, a lit- up remote device. \nJACK If you shoot out the receivers, they'll stop. There are ten rounds in this clip. The first two are live, the next three dummy, then three live, two dummy. \nRamirez stands like a deer in the headlights for an instant and then goes running for the gun. He cannot make it to the gun before the first snow mobile barrels down upon him. He is right against the rail now and goes diving into the snow. The snow mobile goes directly over him and crashes through the rail, falling down to the field below. Ramirez is up and running, grabs the gun, fires two rounds and misses, then hits three dummy rounds which click away as the second snow mobile draws closer. Then he fires and hits a headlight, then fires and misses, then fires and hits the remote device. That snow mobile stops in its tracks. The third now barrels down on Ramirez. He clicks off two dummy rounds and just before the snow mobile hits him, a shot rings out. The receiver shatters and we SEE Jack standing with the smoking gun with which he has just saved Ramirez's life. \nJACK Three times dead. \nINT. CAFETERIA - ABANDONED PRISON - DAY \nIt is after lunch and Jack and Amos are eating ice cream sundaes while Ramirez sits eating the last bit of porridge from the huge bowl. \nAMOS You finish all your porridge? \nRAMIREZ (deadly) Yeah... yeah... I finished all my porridge. \nAMOS Good now you can have some more. \nHe motions for the waiter who crosses with a fresh pot and starts to ladle it out into Ramirez's bowl. Ramirez reaches up and tears at his tie and rips open the top button. Ramirez explodes batting the waiter's hand away and sending the bowl flying. \nRAMIREZ Enough of this porridge shit man, hi jo deputa! Fuck it man... I ain't eatin' no more of this shit! And I ain't wearin' this fuckin' shirt anymore either! \nWith that he rips off the tie and rips open the shirt. \nAMOS Why Miguel amigo, whatever is the matter? \nRAMIREZ I'll tell you what the matter is man... I been here twelve mother fuckin' weeks an' all I've had to eat the whole time is this shit! And those dumb ass basketball games... what's that?! You damn near kill me with those fucking snowmobiles... I haven't seen my family in three months and I still don't know what any plan is or what I'm supposed to be doing! \nAMOS Congratulations! You're acting like a child... like a spoiled brat... \nJACK And not a Navy Lieutenant Commander, which is exactly what would get you killed. \n", "test2_id": 2431, "test3_input": "JACK Stay out of it. \nAMOS It's over, Jack. He's it. \nRamirez stays with the gun pointed at Jack. It is obvious he is in a killing mood, perfectly ready and willing to squeeze the trigger once again. Amos takes the gun from Ramirez, points it up and pulls the trigger... KABOOM! \nEXT. ROAD BY DEAD SEA - AERIAL SHOT - DAY \nWE SUPER THE FOLLOWING: ISRAEL - APRIL, 1987 \nWe have an aerial shot over a date plantation which sits incongruously in the middle of the desert beside the Dead Sea, as we MOVE TO REVEAL a car driving along this barren road. The CAMERA pivots around the car as we See the landscape scroll behind it; the tortured rock formations, the mountains reflected in the water, a desert-scape that looks like something out of Dante, as Peugeot cuts its way along the road. \nINT. PEUGEOT - DEAD SEA - ISRAEL \nJack is in the car with Amos, who drives, and Ramirez. Ramirez has a bandage across his nose. He has black eyes from plastic surgery. Jack hands Ramirez a small bundle which he opens. Inside is a black T-shirt and black jeans. \nRAMIREZ What's this? \nJACK What you'll wear from now on. Black T-shirt and jeans... it's the only thing Carlos ever wears whenever he's not out being a terrorist. It's the opposite of what he was forced to wear as a child... you know... the school uniforms, the white tight collared shirts... It's become like a fetish for him. \nAMOS And to match your new wardrobe, in another two days your bandages will come off and you'll get to show your beautiful new nose to Carla. \nRAMIREZ Who's Carla? \nJACK She's a Venezuelan. She was Carlos' main squeeze about fifteen years ago. She'll put the finishing touches on the act. \nRAMIREZ Why's one of Carlos' girlfriends helping us? \nAMOS Carlos used her... like he uses a lot of women. She emigrated to Israel. Now she wants to get even. \nRAMIREZ What do you mean used her. How? \nJACK He put her on an airplane with a bomb in her suitcase. She would have gone up with everything else. What's that song say? There are fifty ways to leave your lover? Make that fifty- one. \nAMOS She's about thirty-seven... still attractive. \nJACK So it's not gonna be a hardship. \nRAMIREZ What's not gonna be a hardship? \nJACK Making love to her. \nRamirez looks at Jack in shock. \nJACK Annibal... the way in is a woman... her name is Agnieska. It's part of the trap. The KGB will be watching her... we'll make sure of that... She's a more recent girlfriend of Carlos... But they've got to be convinced and so does she. Carlos, you, are going to ask her to do something. She has to believe you're him or she won't risk it. \nRamirez just looks at him, as if cheating on his wife was obviously not part of the bargain. \nJACK What the fuck are you lookin' at? You're gonna help murder this guy, you draw the moral line at extramarital sex? \nRamirez is quiet. \nJACK Don't think of it as cheating. Think of it as fucking for the flag. \nAMOS \"When in doubt, close your eyes and think of England.\" \nEXT. SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET \nAt first we should not realize we are near a building of any kind. We open on a WIDE ANGLE on the Dead Sea from a stunning POV. CRANE DOWN to reveal the silhouette of Ramirez smoking a cigarette. We now SEE that his nose is exactly that of Carlos. He has just a bit of dark circles left under his eyes, just enough to make him seem moody. He tosses the cigarette and turns to enter a room. Now we see that this is a deserted barracks pock-marked with artillery shells and machine gun bullet holes from past wars. \nEXT. BALCONY - SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET \nRamirez turns to enter the barracks with a wide-angle of the landscape overlooking the Dead Sea. He now wears a black T- shirt and black jeans. The Peugeot is parked near the barracks that sits on the edge of the cliff in b.g. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET \nstart TIGHT on a shot of an ashtray. It is overflowing with cigarettes. A woman's hand picks up the butt that is in the ashtray and with the last of its ember she lights another cigarette off it. She is CARLA, mid-thirties, hard edged which mars the beauty she still has. She is intense, neurotic and bitter. \nShe and Ramirez are alone in the living room. She sits in a corner. We become aware of the room. It is a study in contrasts. Light shoots in through shell holes and cracks in ruined walls. And yet, the interior is somehow soft, sensuous, with thick carpet, muslin drapes and a large bed that resembles at one and the same time, a boxing ring and an altar. She pays no attention to Ramirez. She doesn't even acknowledge that he's entered the room. She is in a kind of reverie. \nCARLA The thing about Carlos is... he doesn't lose himself with a woman... not with a lover... maybe with a whore I don't know... I wasn't his whore. Lovers are different to him... he might have a use for them... so he has to seduce them properly. He has to make sure they're so crazy about him they'll do anything for him. \nRAMIREZ When did you...? \nShe holds up a hand without looking at him, commanding his silence. \nCARLA Shhh! You're not here. \nShe rocks herself back and forth, comforting herself and now for the first time we see the bottle of Irish whiskey she holds at her side. She raises it, takes a long gulp, some of the fluid dripping down the corner or her mouth. She doesn't bother to wipe it away. It is there next to tearstains on her cheeks. \nSlowly, her rocking back and forth, her primal comforting, the act of an abused and abandoned child will turn into strokes, caresses of a secret style from a phantom lover who will get her in the mood for what she must do. She must get herself wet. She must get herself ready. She must recapture what it is to be seduced by Carlos. Her hand is her lover now. \nCARLA You don't exist until I'm ready to let you exist, and then... you do exactly what I say. \n", "test3_true": "CARLA It's not pleasure for him... it's... it's... it's... this sick kind of conquest... you know this seduction... he's got to make you not just a lover but a disciple... a worshipper... He brainwashes you with his body... so... so... you'll do anything... you see because he's the perfect lover... he does it all to... not to please you... but to excite you... to... to make it dangerous for you and then, that's very sexy too, to a woman... that danger... like he could kill you in a second... but instead he makes you come... So he's almost killed you, you see? And you have this orgasm right then and it's like he's killed you and there isn't anything left of you and he makes you be born again the way he wants you to be. So there isn't a thought in your brain that he hasn't put there. Not a feeling in your body that he hasn't put there. \nShe masturbates herself stopping just short of climax. Then she looks up at Ramirez, acknowledges his presence and lets him exist. \nCARLA Take off your clothes. \nRAMIREZ Just like that? \nCARLA Look Mister... \nRAMIREZ Miguel... \nCARLA I don't want to know your name... I don't want to know anything about you okay. This isn't fun for me. I'm not here to play soft music and be romantic. I'm here to help you kill him... At least I hope that's what you're going to do. They promised me it was. \nRAMIREZ Yes. \nCARLA Take off your clothes. \nANGLE ON RAMIREZ \nHe takes off his clothes. CAMERA SHOOTS FROM THE WAIST UP. \nCARLA You're smaller than him. \nRAMIREZ (shaking his head) Great. \nCarla slaps him suddenly without warning hard across the face. \nCARLA That's what he would have done if I would have said something like that. Without a moment's hesitation. What's wrong with you?! No eres ni hombre! \nRamirez back hands her and she flies backwards against the couch. \nANGLE ON CARLA \nlying against the couch. Her mouth is bleeding just a little. \nCARLA Now come to me and kiss where you hit. \nShe puts her finger to her lip and sees the blood. Ramirez bends down to her, the passion rising. \nCARLA Kiss where the blood is and then smear it on my lips so I taste it. \nRamirez bends down and kisses her and the blood smears and he kisses her passionately. \nCARLA Now go down on me... yes like that... si... si... tease me... tease... but don't let me come... control me... it's got to be when he wants it... yeah... \nRamirez's head goes down out of frame. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nNEW ANGLE \nRamirez and Carla in bed, both naked, Ramirez is on top... \nCARLA Ask me if I like it... he always asks... he wants to hear it. \nRAMIREZ You like it... \nCARLA Demand it. \nRAMIREZ (harder) You like it?! \nCARLA Yeah... \nRAMIREZ You like it?! \nCARLA Make me beg. \nRAMIREZ Beg for it... \nCARLA Please... \nRAMIREZ Yeah... \nCARLA Please... Tell me you want me to come... \nRAMIREZ I want you to come now... \nCARLA You want to feel it all over you... \nRamirez is too turned on now to follow instructions. \nRAMIREZ Oh yeah baby... yeah... you make me feel so good. \n", "test3_id": 2432}

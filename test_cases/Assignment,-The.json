{"train": "THE ASSIGNMENT \nWritten by \nDan Gordon & Sabi H. Shabtai \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nESTABLISHING SHOT - EXTREME CLOSE - UP - COBBLESTONES - PARIS - EARLY MORNING \nTITLE SEQUENCE BEGINS \nWe OPEN with the screen filled with a dark gray, cut down the middle by a black crevice. We should be unsure of what we are looking at. Is it the surface of the moon or some primeval canyon covered in volcanic ash? Just then a liquid with a yellowish tinge finds its way down through the crevice and further divides the screen in two, like a river border dividing East from West perhaps. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal that the dark gray gulch filled the screen was in fact two paving stones on a Parisian street and the yellowish river that ran down the middle of the stones comes in two tiny streams that lead to two little boys, who are peeing on the pavement, laughing at their mischief. The boys are twins. They wear backpacks and are set to go off to school. Just then we HEAR the voice of a WOMAN shouting in French (with English subtitles). \nFRENCH WOMAN (O.S.) What do you think you're going?! You ought to be ashamed behaving like that! \nCAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal ever more scenes of life on this particular street. The woman shouts at the children from her window and the children run off. At the corner, fresh bread is being delivered to a sidewalk cafe, as chairs are set out at tables by white aproned waiters who are preparing for their morning clientele. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal a taxi driver arguing with a deliver man as a husband kisses his wife goodbye and set off for work as we continue pulling back and across the city over Montmartre, picking up an argument between two drivers here, fresh bread being delivered to a cafe over there. Chairs are being set up at sidewalk tables as the city awakens and we float across Montmartre into a small residential quarter. Husbands kiss wives who send school children on their way as TITLES CONTINUE and the city comes more and more to life and we hover across a small square just up from the Place de la Opera, not far from the Boulevard Saint Germain-des-Pres, with Montmartre in the b.g. The square has a sidewalk cafe with tables extending out onto a peninsula of pavement that stretches to the foot of a small hotel, whose shuttered windows overlook the square. As we pull back and back over the small square, we literally... \nSFX SHOT \n...Pull backwards through the slats of the shutter, going from an aerial shot, being sucked in through the semi-closed shutters into a hotel room where we continue ever so slowly, pulling back. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - PARIS - EARLY MORNING \nThe first thing we SEE in this shot which should appear seamless in its one continuous motion transition from the preceding scene, is a spider-web. We are TIGHT on the web in which a still-living insect struggles against his silky bonds. The web begins to tremble as from up above the spider drops, spinning thread lowering itself down on this latest victim, soon to be lunch. As the spider makes this journey we become aware in the b.g. of the panting sounds of lovemaking. It is a woman's breathless sighs and gasps we hear, but under that, perhaps a man's voice, perhaps not. The sounds build to a climax as the camera continues to pull back until it discovers the glistening body of a beautiful young Parisian woman in post-coital dewy Nirvana. Then, the figure of a nude man in silhouette enters frame and crosses over to the shuttered window. His face and body are half-lit by the slats of light that penetrate from the world outside the hotel room. He lights a cigarette. \nCUT TO: \nANGLE ON - CLOSE ON THE MAN \nwhom we will come to know as CARLOS. He lights the cigarette and takes a thirsty drag sucking the smoke deep into his lungs, glancing out at the street and alternately at the spider who tiptoes down to her prey. He watches the spider envelop the still-living victim with her spindly legs. Then he takes another drag on the cigarette and the ash glows bright, a burning ember which he touches ever so slowly to the spider's body. It sizzles. \nCARLOS (whispering to the burnt spider) You lose... \nHe looks out through the shutters at the digital clock across the square. Then he glances back at the girl whom we will call COLETTE. The conversation is in French with English subtitles. \nCOLETTE What do you mean? \nCARLOS I mean get out. \nCOLETTE You're a pig, you know that? How can you be like that? \nCarlos crosses to her slowly. He runs his hand across her cheek, then down across her throat. Death is in his eyes. \nCARLOS (barely above a whisper) Leave without saying another word. \nINT. BATHROOM - HOTEL - DAY \nCarlos stands in front of the mirror. The mirror is cracked and in it we see the fractured face of Carlos staring back at us from opposite sides of the cracked glass. He wears surgical gloves. From a make up kit by the side of the sink he removes a piece of false hair and spirit gum as TITLES CONTINUE. \nA. Carlos affixes a John Lennon mustache. \nB. Carlos puts on a brown wig of moderately longish hair such as one might have seen on a student in Paris in the early seventies. \nC. Carlos puts on a pair of John Lennon granny glasses and the student look is complete. \nD. Carlos stands in front of a full length mirror in jeans and a blue work shirt over which he puts a worn grey jacket. He now looks every inch the young French student dressing down to look like one of the proletariat. \nEND OF TITLES \nE. Carlos takes an M26 hand grenade and puts it into an inside pocket of his coat. He puts a machine pistol and snaps its ammo clip into it and puts it in his student's shoulder bag and then takes a Walther PPK and places it in his jeans at the small of his back. All the while that he is doing these things he sings: \"ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE.\" \nCARLOS (singing) All you need is love... Rum da, da da da All you need is love Rum da da da da All you need is lo-ve Love is all you need. Love is all you need. \nSUPERIMPOSED: Paris, September 15, 1974. \nEXT. / INT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY \nIt's a hot Sunday afternoon and the complex of shops and a cafe in St. Germain-des-Pres is bustling with young clientele. Inside the cafe, there is a second floor with a balustrade overlooking the tables inside. Outside, there are tables set up on the sidewalk. \nJACK SHAW, a tall, husky American in his late thirties, sits at one of the front tables outside. He reads the International Herald Tribune. The headline is, \"Terrorists Seize Embassy, Issue Demands And Threaten Attacks.\" Jack sips his espresso. \nANGLE ON CARLOS \ndressed as in preceding scene. He enters. Just then Jack looks up and sees him. For an instant, Carlos looks at Jack, tenses just slightly. Jack looks back at his paper paying no attention. Carlos pulls out a cigarette, pats his pockets for a light. Then he crosses to Jack. \nCARLOS Pardon monsieur... \nHe mimes flicking a match and Jack looks for a match. He's out. He offers the lit end of his cigarette. Carlos cups Jack's hand. \nNIGERIAN OIL MINISTER (angry) I protest the unfound charges of the oil minister from Venezuela. We do not use, nor intend to use, the lower gradings to capture more of the market -- \nHis words are cut short when the door is kicked open, and Carlos strides in. \nCARLOS (brandishing his automatic) EVERYONE FREEZE! \nEveryone frantically hits the floor. That is, with the exception of TWO BODYGUARDS. They try for their weapons. A short burst from Carlos' Beretta machine pistol which is pulled from the inside of his trenchcoat brings them to the floor. This weapon is not silenced, but deafening. Just then Koj enters the room from the corridor. \nKOJ We've got company. \nSuddenly, there's the sound of INTENSE GUNFIRE coming from the corridor. \nANGLE ON - CARLOS \nHe reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a pocket-sized Chinese RGD5 grenade. He yanks the pin, lets the spoon fly, listens to the fuse hiss, counts quite calmly and then tosses the live grenade to Koj who catches it and in one movement tosses it out the door. A loud sound of GRENADE EXPLOSION, and plaster powders those glued to the floor. GASPS OF TERROR. But the gunfire outside ceases. \nCARLOS My name is Carlos. You'll do as I say. \nHis smile is cunning, mocking, and... familiar. \nEXT. VIENNA AIRPORT - SNOWSTORM - MAGIC HOUR \nWe SEE an Air France jet liner touch down on the runway. \nEXT. VIENNA AIRPORT - SNOWSTORM - MAGIC HOUR \nJack comes down the steps of the just-landed jet. The blizzard whips around his face as he walks down the stair unit and onto the tarmac, pulling his overcoat up around him. \nEXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY, VIENNA - SNOWSTORM - MAGIC HOUR - EST. \nINT. OFFICE - AMERICAN EMBASSY - VIENNA - NIGHT \nBehind the desk is CARL MICKENS, the CIA Station Chief -- tall, angular, cropped grey hair. He is in mid-conversation with Jack Shaw who sits opposite him, his overcoat over the arm of the chair in which he sits. He has obviously just come from the airport. \nMICKENA ...Twenty million dollars ransom. \nJACK Who's asking for it? \nMICKENA \"The Arm of the Arab Revolution.\" Alias of the month time. (shrugs) Could be anybody. The point is... their leader claims to be Carlos... \nJACK He does, does he? \nMICKENA He wants to make sure everyone knows it's him. He wants the credit and the Austrians want a positive ID. That's when your name came up. \nJACK Who brought my name up? \nMICKENA The guy who says he's Carlos. The Austrians want you there to identify him. \nJACK Where? \nMICKENA At the airport. Tomorrow. When they provide the plane to fly him and the hostages to Libya. Carlos evidently feels very comfortable in Libya. \nJACK They got him here in their own backyard and they're gonna let him walk away?! \nMICKENA They've got no choice, Jack. \nJACK Bullshit! Let 'em handle it like the Israelis would. \nMICKENA They're not the Israelis Jack. It's not their fight. \nJACK Then let me take him out! They want me to meet him at the airport. I can get close enough to get a clear shot at him. We can end this shit now. \nMICKENA Jack! He's got seventy hostages. \nJACK Fuck the hostages! \nMickens looks at him almost in horror. Jack knows he has let down too much of the mask of professionalism as it were. \nJACK (apologetically) Harold, we can handle it with a minimum loss of life. \nMICKENA We will handle it with no loss of life. Those aren't just any hostages. They are the oil ministers of the richest countries in the world, and that twenty million bucks they're gonna have to pay isn't gonna break 'em you know. It's nothing to them. They just want to pay it and... it's not our fight. \nJACK What do you think Carlos is gonna do with that money? Put it in mutual funds? He'll use it to hit us. Let me assemble a team and we can... \nMICKENA Jack goddamnit, there isn't any team to assemble! You're a fuckin' dinosaur. We're out of the assassination business. All of us! You got a personal hard on against this guy because he made you look like an asshole and now he's gonna rub your nose in it. I can appreciate your feelings, but it's not going down on our soil. It is not with our nationals and it is not our fight! Now I got my orders and you just got yours. \nINT. VIENNA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - VIENNA - NIGHT \nCarl, Jack and various other CIA functionaries walk quickly down the corridor with Austrian police and intelligence officers. Jack carries a briefcase as do they all. \nANGLE ON - JACK \nJACK I gotta hit the john. \nto reveal a man standing in silhouette, the man who has just crushed out the cigarette. We cannot see his face because he has a camera to his eye. \nNEW ANGLE - POV THROUGH THE CAMERA LENS \nThrough the lens of the camera just established we SEE an old Rabbi praying at the wall. CLICK! The shutter captures the shot. \nBACK TO SCENE \nThe man in silhouette now lowers the camera and we SEE that he is CARLOS! There is no mistake even though the nose, perhaps is a little different and this time he is clean- shaven, it is still Carlos the Jackals. He smiles slightly. \nEXT. CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE \nBusy photographing it, Carlos doesn't seem to notice the TWO ARABS who watch him surreptitiously. He walks in front of soldiers who laugh and look at us POV Carlos. \nANGLE \nCarlos reaches into his pocket. Is he perhaps going for a grenade to toss at these soldiers? We build tension as he pulls out instead, another roll of film and with great determination, we have the CLICK of the door of the camera to enhance our music beat as tension builds. Surely it can't be long till Carlos does something awful. \nEXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY \nCarlos walks towards the Suq, working his way through the crown from the Damascus gate as we reveal more soldiers in the foreground, surveilling the area. \nEXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY \nFrom the POV of the two Arabs following him, we SEE Carlos lost, or pretending to be, as he ambles along through the Suq, past all sorts of vendors hawking their wares. Heads of fish are cut off with the swift slash of a knife in one stall, freshly skinned lambs hang by their feet in another. Carlos, still looking lost, approaches a street vendor hawking rosary beads. We SEE them talk but cannot hear their dialogue. \nCarlos walks on. \nEXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY \nA group of children play an impromptu game of soccer. \nNEW ANGLE - SAME SCENE - POV CARLOS THROUGH CAMERA LENS \nWe watch these innocent children playing. If this was a gun sight they'd be dead. CLICK! \nNEW ANGLE \nIt is Carlos who has taken the picture. His smile at the sight of the children is no longer a subtle one. There is some secret enjoyment here. \nIt's then, that he notices the Two Arabs tailing him. \nCLOSE ON - CARLOS \nHe frowns. \nNow what happens can be interpreted in one of two ways. Carlos takes a turn down an alleyway that has at first a shop or two, and then is nothing but deserted and foreboding alley. He is either trying to shake the two Arabs or he has just entered every tourist's nightmare: a deserted alley in a foreign country with two bad guys. He quickens his pace. The Arabs do too. Carlos now knows they're after him and he takes off running. \nEXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY - CHASE SEQUENCE ANGLE \nSo do the two Arabs. Only now there are THREE MORE ARABS coming after him. \nMOVING \nA tense, desperate CHASE in the Moslem Quarter's labyrinth of twisted alleys and narrow streets. When his Arab pursuers lose sight of him briefly, Carlos takes something out of his pocket, some sort of ID and throws it in an alleyway. \nEXT. SUQ - JERUSALEM - DAY \nCarlos races through the Suq, past a group of Arabs who begin heeding the call to prayer. They roll out prayer mats and begin acclaiming in Arabic that there is only one God and Mohammed is his prophet. Carlos grabs one of the canvas awnings that shade the alleyways and this cafe. He rips it off, trying to make an obstacle course between him and his pursuers. He overturns trays of olives, sacks of sunflower seeds, anything he can get his hands on. \nNEW ANGLE \nCarlos runs headlong into a copper serving platter that is hanging on display. He is disoriented, terrified, and then seemingly from out of nowhere, he is tackled, grabbed by the Arabs and dragged to a dark alley between two stores. Carlos is overcome and brought down to the ground. One of the Arabs evidently has a deep dislike for Carlos and though Carlos is subdued, he kicks the shit out of him. \nCUT TO BLACK: \nINT. WINDOWLESS CELL - DAY \nThis room is your worst nightmare in the Middle East. It could be a cellar suite in Beirut, or an interrogation cell in Damascus. There is no way of knowing. It is simply an empty room with a large metal ring embedded into the floor, to which Carlos is shackled. Battered and badly bruised, he's obviously in great pain. The room's metal door SCREECHES as it opens slowly and a new man whom we will call AMOS enters. With him are two of the Arabs we've seen earlier. They're bareheaded now, without their kaffiyehs. \nAMOS (accented English) How do you feel? \nHe smiles. \nCARLOS (broken English) I do not speak English. (in Spanish) Yo soy Cubano... de Cuba... Castro... Su amigos... Amigos... Entiende? \nAMOS You spoke English well enough to your contact... the street vendor... so please let's not play games. We're both professionals, Carlos. \nCARLOS (with heavy Cuban accent) My name... Ramirez... no Carlos. \nAMOS Yes, I know what your name is... Illich Ramirez... \nCARLOS No Illich. \nHe looks uncomfortably over to his aide who gently keeps the line moving. CAMERA FOLLOWS ANNIBAL AND MAURA DOWN THE RECEPTION LINE. There in front of them is Jack in a white linen suit. \nJACK We do keep bumping into each other don't we. How do you do, Mrs. Ramirez? I was over at your lovely home the other day but I felt cheated because I had to leave before I had the pleasure of meeting you. \nMAURA The pleasure is mine... \nJACK Para servirle, Yo soy encantado de conocerte. \nMAURA Encantada Senor... \nJACK Shaw... Jack Shaw. \nMAURA Senor Shaw. Mucho gusto. \nRAMIREZ My wife speaks English Mister Shaw... so do I. \nJACK Perdonname, I didn't think you'd be embarrassed to speak Spanish in front of the Admiral. A sus ordenes. \nANGLE ON \nTHE BAR - Ramirez stands at the bar. \nRAMIREZ (to bartender) I'll have a club soda and... uhh... a glass of white wine please... \nJack steps up behind him. Jack holds a small wrapped package. \nJACK Let me guess the white wine is for your wife right? Cause you're afraid to drink anything stronger than club soda around the brass. How do you stand this shit Annibal? I mean they're all so fuckin' constipated. \nRAMIREZ My wife is waiting for her wine... if you'll excuse me. \nJack stands in front of him blocking his way. \nJACK Oh there's a fiery retort. \nRAMIREZ (under his breath) How about fuck you. \nJACK I'd believe it if you said it a little louder... \nRamirez controls his anger which is starting to show through in the bulging veins. \nJACK Look at these guys. You don't belong with them. You belong with me. What did Darth Vader say to Luke? Come over to the dark side? You have no idea of the power we have. \nRAMIREZ Hey... I told you I didn't want anything to do with you. \nJACK How's it going to look in your jacket? Your country came to you requesting help and you turned it down. Not exactly promotion material, know what I mean? These people don't want you in their club, Annibal. I do. \nRAMIREZ The answer is no. That's the end of it. \nEXT. RAMIREZ HOUSE - DAY \nWe open on a shot of the front door. The doorbell is rung and the door opens after a beat, revealing Ramirez. We don't yet see who is at the door. \nRAMIREZ Oh Jesus... what do you want? \nNEW ANGLE \nRevealing it is Jack who is at the door. \nJACK I want you to come with me. \nRAMIREZ Well then get set for disappointment. \nJACK Okay. Then you are ordered to come with me. \nRAMIREZ You can't order me to do shit. \nJust then the cellular phone which Jack holds rings. Jack smiles and holds out the phone to Ramirez. \nJACK It's for you. \nRamirez takes the phone, totally faked out. He presses the \"send\" button and gingerly says... \nRAMIREZ (into Cell phone) Hello... who? Oh... yes sir... Yes sir... Yes sir... Yes sir. I will... yes sir. \nWe HOLD for a beat on Ramirez's look at Jack who stands there unable to keep from smiling. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - DAY \nA helicopter lands in its air ambulance spot outside the Emergency Room entrance of Bethesda Naval Hospital. Out step Ramirez and Jack. They cross over to the hospital entrance. We SEE a sign on the wall identifying this as BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE. \nINT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - DOCTOR'S LOUNGE - DAY \nRAMIREZ I was just reading some... manuals... \nShe bends down and kisses his neck. \nMAURA Read 'em on the Navy's time... this is my time... \nShe sits into his lap, they kiss and the robe slips down off her shoulders. He kisses her more passionately now. \nINT. CHILDREN'S ROOM - RAMIREZ HOUSE - NIGHT \nRamirez enters. He is wearing a robe, having just gotten up out of bed. It is perhaps, one in the morning. Joey is asleep, holding a stuffed animal. The baby is asleep in her crib looking like a little angel. Ramirez pulls the cover up on the baby and pats her gently so as not to wake her and then bends down and kisses his son. \nEXT. NEW LONDON, CONNECTICUT - SUBMARINE BASE - DAY \nWE SUPER THE WORDS: \"NOVEMBER, 1986\" \nRamirez pulls up in a car with his wife and two children. He is wearing his khaki uniform and carries a sea bag. He embraces Maura. \nRAMIREZ You'll see... it'll go by fast. \nMAURA Not fast enough. \nRamirez bends down to hug Joey. \nRAMIREZ You take care of Mommy, okay? \nJOEY But why do you have to go? \nRAMIREZ Well they're finally giving me my chance to go into subs... that's what I've always wanted you know... \nJOEY New color subs... \nRAMIREZ Nuclear... \nJOEY Is there going to be a war, Poppi? \nRAMIREZ Not if I can help it. \nJOEY Then why do you need to go away? \nRAMIREZ Because sometimes countries need soldiers and sailors to be on guard so there won't be a war... So all the little children like you and baby Yolanda will be safe. \nJOEY Why can't somebody else's Daddy go on the sub and you could stay here and go to my games? \nRAMIREZ Because I'm the one they asked and I'm the one who knows how to do the job. \nHe kisses Joey, stands up and kisses Maura and the baby she holds and walks past the guard gate, showing his ID as his wife and children wave. \nEXT. AERIAL SHOT - MONTREAL, CANADA - DAY \nMontreal is an island in the middle of the St. Lawrence. It is a city part way up a mountain, Mount Royale. We TRACK a car as it drives up out of the city, up the mountain to of all places, a cemetery which sits at the foot of a deserted prison that looms above it. The cemetery like the prison is deserted. There can be no more desolate place than a graveyard full of long-dead prisoners whose prison has long since been shut down. \nWE SUPER THE FOLLOWING WORDS: TEMPORARY CIA SAFE HOUSE - MONTREAL, CANADA \nEXT. ROAD LEADING TO CEMETERY - DAY \nWe SEE Jack's car with him and Ramirez in it driving into the cemetery. As it does, it crosses in front of a video camera inconspicuously placed in a tree. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CEMETERY TO ABANDONED PRISON - MONTREAL - DAY \nA camera mounted atop a light fixture pans with Jack's car all the way up to the prison entrance. Signs on the prison proclaim that it is closed and that trespassing is forbidden. As Jack pulls up at the prison, a plainclothed operative comes out and as Ramirez and Jack pull Ramirez's bag out of the car, the operative slips into the driver's side and whisks it away. The ground around the area is full of snow that has not been plowed so the look of desertion is complete. \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MONTREAL - DAY \nThere is an observation tower in the middle of the room which has become home to the pigeons who now flap noisily out of it as Jack crosses with Ramirez. The place has the look of an impromptu military encampment in a bombed out wreck of a building. In the observation room are several nondescript types. Jack shows Ramirez in. \nJACK This is an ad hoc operation set up specifically for your mission. When that's over, not even a trace of it will remain. You don't need to know anyone's name. And from now on, your name is Miguel... Security. \nRAMIREZ So your name really isn't Jack Shaw? \nJACK (smiling) Of course it is. \nINT. CORRIDOR - OFF OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY \nJack walks Ramirez down the corridor. They pass the Surveillance Room, the small cell with its satellite dish and single computer terminal and operator established earlier as Technician #1. From here, cables snake their way along everywhere. The place has the look of a mobile high-tech spy station that just happens to be set up in a former prison. Ramirez looks around. The idea of being in a prison is obviously uncomfortable for him. \nJACK Your mother is Irish... Irish American. \nRAMIREZ Yes. \nJACK Something wrong, Miguel? \nRamirez says nothing. \nAMOS Carlos is the opposite of that and that's what's so seductive, you know? He can kill whomever he chooses... ravish whoever he chooses... take whatever he chooses. Do... whatever he chooses. It is to be in many ways a superman, not bound by the mores or morals of humanity. \nJACK And if you learn what we can teach you, you'll be one, too. If not, you'll be dead. \nINT. ABANDONED PRISON - CAFETERIA - THE NEXT MORNING \nIt is a huge, empty room. Ramirez sits at the lone table as Amos enters. Ramirez is eating a bowl of porridge. His breath steams out in the cold. The room is freezing but instead of a warm jacket, he wears light prison overalls. \nAMOS Good morning. How's the porridge, you like it? \nRAMIREZ 'Morning. It's not bad. \nHe finishes what's left in the bowl. Amos reaches over to a side warming table. There is a huge pot of porridge there. \nAMOS Good... finish everything in the pot. \nRAMIREZ There's got to be like... eight helpings in there maybe... \nAMOS No questions... Just do. \nFrom now on, unless otherwise indicated Ramirez is in the too-tight shirt and tie and light jacket. \nJack is in the distance, observing. \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - ABANDONED PRISON - DAY \nRamirez is doing furious situps, hanging off the balcony of one of the tiers, with his feet linked under one of the bars so that as he does his sit-up it is over an abyss. Amos stands in front of Ramirez, puffing on a cigar as he speaks, so that Ramirez is gulping in breaths of cigar smoke as he exercises. \nAMOS Name and place of birth! \nRAMIREZ Illich Ramirez. Caracas, Venezuela. \nAMOS Your father? \nRAMIREZ Doctor Jose Altagracia Ramirez... Do you have to smoke that cigar? \nAMOS Yes. \nThere is a silence between them. This is obviously the end of that subject. Then Amos goes on. \nAMOS Carlos' father abandoned him and his mother because he wanted to be a playboy. Your father abandoned you in effect, when he was sent to prison. Either way, it's a lonely child missing his father. I want you to take what you know of your real father and superimpose it onto this the image of Carlos' father, so when you talk of one you are talking of the other with the same emotion... the same love, the same resentment... the same sadness, the same anger. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CEMETERY - MONTREAL - DAY \nAs Jack and Ramirez walk toward the cemetery, we SEE Ramirez who wears a lightweight white parka so that he shivers in the cold in contrast to Jack's heavy winter gear. Ramirez carries what appears to be a gun. \nJACK You need to not only remember the names on every tombstone, but where they are so when I call out a name, you whirl and shoot. \nThey walk into a scene that is completely surreal. Standing behind every tombstone is one of the crew of trainers. \nEach man wears a white parka and white pants against the freezing cold. In the center of their impromptu circle stands Ramirez, also wearing white, but of much lighter material so that he shivers in the cold. All of them including Ramirez hold paint pellet guns. It is a cemetery full of living targets which can shoot back. Jack stands outside the circle. \nRAMIREZ It's kind of cold. You think I might be able to borrow a warmer jacket from someone? \nJACK Brisson! We don't want you to be comfortable. That's just what will get you killed. \nRamirez hesitates a moment, trying to remember where the tombstone with the name \"Brisson\" is. The trainer who stands behind the \"Brisson\" tombstone has no such hesitation. He fires at Ramirez and an ugly black splotch of paint explodes on Ramirez's white suit. Ramirez shakes his head in frustration. \nJACK DuPres! Paquet! \nRamirez whirls, misses one, is hit again with another black splotch but hits the Paquet tombstone square in the chest with a black splotch of his own. \nINT. KITCHEN SET - PRISON - DAY \nIn the middle of a huge room, a movie set has been erected. There are flats supported by sand bags which form the \"set\" of a kitchen. The set is perfect in every way but its position inside of a huge prison hall lends a quality of the macabre, since no movie is being shot here and no audience will ever see these performances. Jack is there with Ramirez. He opens the refrigerator and Ramirez looks inside as Jack times him on his watch, then closes the refrigerator. Ramirez sneezes. He has caught a cold but must ignore it. \nRAMIREZ Top shelf... some milk, some juice, maybe some cottage cheese, a couple bottles of beer, some tomatoes... I don't know... \nJACK What kind of milk, how many cartons, open or closed, what kind of juice, how full was the bottle, was it cottage cheese or cream cheese, how many bottles of beer, how many tomatoes? This is life and death! \nJack opens the cupboard. \nJACK Look here... Ten seconds, how many cups, saucers, plates, look this time! \nINT. CAFETERIA - ABANDONED PRISON - MONTREAL - DAY \nRamirez sits practicing his Venezuelan accent in English, repeating phrases he hears from a native speaker on a tape recorder as he eats another of the interminable bowls of porridge. \nEXT. CEMETERY - MONTREAL - DAY \nAMOS Finally you're acting like a willful spoiled child which is just what Carlos was. \nJACK We couldn't just let you study Carlos. If this thing is going to work, you have to become him. \nRamirez looks at him in disgust. \nRAMIREZ The two most elite intelligence services in the world and the best you can come up with is this porridge bullshit?! \nAMOS As a child Carlos was fed that porridge that you love so much every day. He hated it. Every woman or man he's ever been close to he told about that porridge... how the very smell of it made him sick. And now it makes you sick. \nJACK When he was in school he was a scrawny little kid. The last one to get picked for any teams. He felt as clumsy as we've made you feel... \nAMOS His father smoked cigars... the same ones whose smell you complained about. The only cover that can save your life... is the one you believe yourself. Now... are you ready to pass the next test? \nRamirez just looks at them, in a kind of shock. \nAMOS I'll take that for a yes. You're about to go into your house. Your wife has told you she was away with the children for a week. She is entering the house for the first time in a week with you. The children are still at Grandma's so the two of you have a nice romantic time ahead of you. Walk through the house... through the living room and the kitchen only. You have thirty seconds. Walk casually through the house so as not to make her suspicious of anything you do and find out if she's telling you the truth or not. If you pass this test your questions will be answered. If not... you'll be sent home to Virginia and this will be the end of it. \nINT. ABANDONED PRISON - LIVING ROOM SET - MONTREAL - DAY \nRamirez walks casually through the living room with camera following. Amos and Jack walk behind him. Ramirez bends down to tie his shoe near the sofa. He crosses into the kitchen and camera follows. He opens the refrigerator and takes out a carton of milk. He takes a drink from the carton and dribbles some onto his shirt and onto the floor. He gets an \"I'm such a slob\" look on his face. Then he replaces the milk, crosses to the sink, takes the sponge off the sink and a paper towel. He mops up the spill with the sponge first and then with the paper towel, then tosses the paper towel into the trash. As he speaks, Ramirez himself will be amazed at how much he is able to deduce using the techniques he's been taught. \nJACK (looking at watch) Time's up. \nAMOS Nu? Is she telling the truth or lying? \nRAMIREZ She's got to be lying, otherwise this would be a very short test and I don't think that's what you had in mind. She had a man over. \nJACK How do you know? \nRAMIREZ She hasn't been here in a week? Then why was the sponge still damp. It means she washed dishes. Take a look at the dish rack. There's water in the tray underneath it. Probably from a couple of plates. There's a bit of water in the silverware tray. The milk is still fresh... not even a hint of being sour and the date on it is a week from today... means she just bought it yesterday or the day before. The margarine's fresh-bought but it's already been opened. Same with the bread. \nAMOS How do you know it was a man? \nRAMIREZ (ignoring him a beat) She might have met him at a bar because there's a book of matches in the garbage. She was probably careful to throw the cigarette away but there's still a bit of ash and that cigarette smell at the bottom of the liner. \nJACK What else? \nRAMIREZ I think they made love on the sofa because one of the cushions has been turned over and there's the indentation of a tennis shoe print in the rug over there. \nHe looks down at Jack's shoes. \nRAMIREZ Sorta like the ones you're wearing, Jack. Besides, I know it was a man because I smelled after-shave on the couch. \nHe gets a quizzical look, crosses to the couch, sniffs. \nRAMIREZ ...Cheap kind. \nHe crosses to Jack and sniffs Jack as well. \nRAMIREZ Jack... you've been fucking my wife. \nHe holds index finger and thumb up to Jack's head like a gun, reprising his mentor's gesture to him and making the sound of a gunshot with his mouth. \nRAMIREZ Now who's dead? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nWe have four quick cuts. Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! In each one, Ramirez who stands in the center of the trainers, whirls like a ballet dancer and beats each trainer to the punch, hitting dead center on each one with his paint pellet gun. From the side, Amos and Jack nod to each other approvingly. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nA triumphant Ramirez walks with Amos and Jack. \nJACK The plan is to get the KGB to eliminate Carlos for us. Carlos knows every link between the KGB and every terrorist organization in the world. He's not only the smoking gun, he knows every contact there ever was. We make the KGB think that Carlos is ready to turn... ready to go over to the CIA, and they'll take him out. \nRAMIREZ Why would they think Carlos would go over to the CIA? \nAMOS Money... fifty million... not for the forces of world revolution this time, but for him, in his pocket with a new identity and CIA protection. They'll believe it... if we lay it out right... they'll believe it. \nRAMIREZ When do we move? \nAMOS Not so fast. You're far from ready. I would think another three months of training and then... \nRAMIREZ Bullshit! I'm ready now. Give me any test you want. Christ, I already passed your tests... what more do you want? \nEXT. ABANDONED PRISON - SUNSET \nThe sun is just setting. There is the silhouette of the prison in the snow. A kind of dark serenity permeates the scene. \nINT. CAFETERIA - ABANDONED PRISON - SUNSET \nHe tosses the brain to Jack who catches it. \nJACK Brilliant, Doctor! \nJack eats the brain. \nJACK And tasty, too! \nANGLE ON - RAMIREZ \nas he walks down the corridor. \nINT. CORRIDOR - DAY ANGLE ON - RAMIREZ'S HAND \nIt morphs from his own hand to that of a child and the child's hand gives birth to a woman's hand who morph's up alongside of him. It is Ramirez's mother. \nNEW ANGLE \nChild Ramirez and his Mother walk down the corridor behind two Cuban prison guards. The cells are full of Cuban political prisoners. There are shouts and screams of agony from men being tortured somewhere far off. They reach Ramirez's father's cell. Child Ramirez reaches out for his father's hand. A guard pushes his hand away. RAMIREZ'S FATHER speaks in Spanish. \nRAMIREZ'S FATHER Vaya mi hijo. Vaya rapido! \nINT. CORRIDOR - ABANDONED PRISON - NIGHT ANGLE ON - PIGEONS \nThey come flapping their wings, dive bombing at us. \nNEW ANGLE - RAMIREZ \nHe walks in his black jeans and T-shirt. The cells are empty around him but up ahead he hears the sounds of someone making love. Well, not making love... fucking. He approaches the sounds and there in one cell is is wife Maura under Carlos, humping away at her. Carlos looks up at Ramirez. \nANGLE ON CARLOS \nin cell humping Maura. \nCARLOS (looking at Ramirez) I think she likes me better... don't you baby. She likes it rough... you never knew that? Yala... ruh mi hun. \nHe motions for Ramirez to leave. \nANGLE ON - RAMIREZ \nHe is about to rush the cell when more pigeons come flapping down at him. He turns and... \nINT. CORRIDOR - ABANDONED PRISON - NIGHT - SFX NEW ANGLE \nThe pigeon becomes a dove gliding in a shaft of moonlight. Then it leaves the moonlight and it turns into a crow. \nNEW ANGLE \nThe crow turns back into a dove and then suddenly the dove begins to choke, to vomit. It opens its beak and out of its mouth emerges the wet, slimy head of a full grown ravenous crow. It is coming straight out of the dove's mouth and straight at us, to devour us. We HEAR RAMIREZ SCREAM OVER THIS. \nINT. ABANDONED PRISON - CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - MORNING \nJack and Amos walk down the corridor. They both look as if they have been up all night, which indeed they have. Both are in need of a shower and shave. \nAMOS I hope we didn't go too far with this. \nJACK I'd rather have him wind up in a mental institution fucked up on LSD than shot in some back alley in Libya. If he can't handle this, he sure as shit can't handle going operational. \nThey round the corner. There, looking up at them, sitting in a chair, showered, shaved, looking fresh and ready to greet the day is Ramirez. He is reading his Arabic book. He looks up at them. \nRAMIREZ Okay... what's next? \nINT. KGB HEADQUARTERS - CORRIDOR - MOSCOW - NIGHT \nWe begin on a shot of a huge statue of Lenin which dominates this corridor. As camera swings around we SEE a HEAD KGB OFFICER with his KGB AIDE. OVER this shot we SUPER: \nKGB CENTRAL COMMAND - MOSCOW \nThe head KGB officer holds a report. He reads aloud in Russian and we SUPER ENGLISH SUBTITLES. From now on, all dialogue in Russian will be indicated by putting the dialogue in parentheses. The KGB Officer is very smug about the report. \nHEAD KGB OFFICER (glancing up from report) [We're just gotten information from our resident in Zurich that the CIA head of station there has deposited letters of credit in the amount of fifty million dollars into the account of a Mister Paulo Ortega... It would appear the Americans are dangling a very impressive bait for what I can only assume is a very juicy fish. I want to know who this Paulo Ortega is and what he's going to give the CIA that is worth so very much money. And then we'll see what we can do about that.] \nHe smiles with a great deal of self-satisfaction. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - MAGIC HOUR - AERIAL SHOT \nRamirez races down the road in the Jeep. The road twists and turns as a light snow begins to fall. \nINT. JEEP - NIGHT \nRamirez drives and we SEE that he has an earpiece which goes to a Walkman tape recorder. We HEAR the instructions being fed to him on the tape in Jack's voice: \nJACK (THRU TAPE) You're going to hit a hairpin turn exactly three tenths of a mile from the stop sign which should be coming into view at any minute. \nJACK Stay out of it. \nAMOS It's over, Jack. He's it. \nRamirez stays with the gun pointed at Jack. It is obvious he is in a killing mood, perfectly ready and willing to squeeze the trigger once again. Amos takes the gun from Ramirez, points it up and pulls the trigger... KABOOM! \nEXT. ROAD BY DEAD SEA - AERIAL SHOT - DAY \nWE SUPER THE FOLLOWING: ISRAEL - APRIL, 1987 \nWe have an aerial shot over a date plantation which sits incongruously in the middle of the desert beside the Dead Sea, as we MOVE TO REVEAL a car driving along this barren road. The CAMERA pivots around the car as we See the landscape scroll behind it; the tortured rock formations, the mountains reflected in the water, a desert-scape that looks like something out of Dante, as Peugeot cuts its way along the road. \nINT. PEUGEOT - DEAD SEA - ISRAEL \nJack is in the car with Amos, who drives, and Ramirez. Ramirez has a bandage across his nose. He has black eyes from plastic surgery. Jack hands Ramirez a small bundle which he opens. Inside is a black T-shirt and black jeans. \nRAMIREZ What's this? \nJACK What you'll wear from now on. Black T-shirt and jeans... it's the only thing Carlos ever wears whenever he's not out being a terrorist. It's the opposite of what he was forced to wear as a child... you know... the school uniforms, the white tight collared shirts... It's become like a fetish for him. \nAMOS And to match your new wardrobe, in another two days your bandages will come off and you'll get to show your beautiful new nose to Carla. \nRAMIREZ Who's Carla? \nJACK She's a Venezuelan. She was Carlos' main squeeze about fifteen years ago. She'll put the finishing touches on the act. \nRAMIREZ Why's one of Carlos' girlfriends helping us? \nAMOS Carlos used her... like he uses a lot of women. She emigrated to Israel. Now she wants to get even. \nRAMIREZ What do you mean used her. How? \nJACK He put her on an airplane with a bomb in her suitcase. She would have gone up with everything else. What's that song say? There are fifty ways to leave your lover? Make that fifty- one. \nAMOS She's about thirty-seven... still attractive. \nJACK So it's not gonna be a hardship. \nRAMIREZ What's not gonna be a hardship? \nJACK Making love to her. \nRamirez looks at Jack in shock. \nJACK Annibal... the way in is a woman... her name is Agnieska. It's part of the trap. The KGB will be watching her... we'll make sure of that... She's a more recent girlfriend of Carlos... But they've got to be convinced and so does she. Carlos, you, are going to ask her to do something. She has to believe you're him or she won't risk it. \nRamirez just looks at him, as if cheating on his wife was obviously not part of the bargain. \nJACK What the fuck are you lookin' at? You're gonna help murder this guy, you draw the moral line at extramarital sex? \nRamirez is quiet. \nJACK Don't think of it as cheating. Think of it as fucking for the flag. \nAMOS \"When in doubt, close your eyes and think of England.\" \nEXT. SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET \nAt first we should not realize we are near a building of any kind. We open on a WIDE ANGLE on the Dead Sea from a stunning POV. CRANE DOWN to reveal the silhouette of Ramirez smoking a cigarette. We now SEE that his nose is exactly that of Carlos. He has just a bit of dark circles left under his eyes, just enough to make him seem moody. He tosses the cigarette and turns to enter a room. Now we see that this is a deserted barracks pock-marked with artillery shells and machine gun bullet holes from past wars. \nEXT. BALCONY - SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET \nRamirez turns to enter the barracks with a wide-angle of the landscape overlooking the Dead Sea. He now wears a black T- shirt and black jeans. The Peugeot is parked near the barracks that sits on the edge of the cliff in b.g. \nINT. SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET \nstart TIGHT on a shot of an ashtray. It is overflowing with cigarettes. A woman's hand picks up the butt that is in the ashtray and with the last of its ember she lights another cigarette off it. She is CARLA, mid-thirties, hard edged which mars the beauty she still has. She is intense, neurotic and bitter. \nShe and Ramirez are alone in the living room. She sits in a corner. We become aware of the room. It is a study in contrasts. Light shoots in through shell holes and cracks in ruined walls. And yet, the interior is somehow soft, sensuous, with thick carpet, muslin drapes and a large bed that resembles at one and the same time, a boxing ring and an altar. She pays no attention to Ramirez. She doesn't even acknowledge that he's entered the room. She is in a kind of reverie. \nCARLA The thing about Carlos is... he doesn't lose himself with a woman... not with a lover... maybe with a whore I don't know... I wasn't his whore. Lovers are different to him... he might have a use for them... so he has to seduce them properly. He has to make sure they're so crazy about him they'll do anything for him. \nRAMIREZ When did you...? \nShe holds up a hand without looking at him, commanding his silence. \nCARLA Shhh! You're not here. \nShe rocks herself back and forth, comforting herself and now for the first time we see the bottle of Irish whiskey she holds at her side. She raises it, takes a long gulp, some of the fluid dripping down the corner or her mouth. She doesn't bother to wipe it away. It is there next to tearstains on her cheeks. \nSlowly, her rocking back and forth, her primal comforting, the act of an abused and abandoned child will turn into strokes, caresses of a secret style from a phantom lover who will get her in the mood for what she must do. She must get herself wet. She must get herself ready. She must recapture what it is to be seduced by Carlos. Her hand is her lover now. \nCARLA You don't exist until I'm ready to let you exist, and then... you do exactly what I say. \nCARLA Stop!... Stop it! \nShe pushes Ramirez back. She sits up gropes for a cigarette. \nRAMIREZ What... What'd I do... \nCARLA He never loses control... He never tells you how he feels. He's in control. He's the one who makes you feel what he wants you to feel. He never feels anything... You stupid... stupid... \nShe fumbles with a lighter... Then she throws it aside and the cigarette. \nCARLA Roll over! \nRAMIREZ Why? \nCARLA On your back! \nRamirez rolls onto his back and she gets on top of him. CAMERA SHOOTS FROM THE WAIST UP. \nCARLA I'm Carlos... You're me. \nShe starts humping him. Her voice goes down very low. \nCARLA You like it... \nShe humps harder. Ramirez evidently does. \nRAMIREZ Yeah. \nCARLA You like it? \nRAMIREZ Oh baby... \nCARLA Ooooo I want to make you come... \nRAMIREZ Yeah... \nCARLA I want to make you come... I want to feel it all over me. \nRAMIREZ Yeah... yeahhh... Yeahhhhhh. \nRamirez is almost at the point of orgasm and Carla reaches down with her hands and starts to choke him. \nRAMIREZ (scared) What the fuck are you doin'? \nCARLA Let me... let me do it... Put your hands down. \nShe humps him harder and chokes him and he climaxes and then she releases her grasp on his throat... \nCARLA He does that... he's crazy... he chokes you... just a little. \nShe gets off him and lights up a cigarette. \nCARLA Then he goes to the refrigerator and eats... He's always hungry afterwards... always... God I feel like filth. \nShe starts crying and the crying grows louder. Ramirez rolls over to her to take her in his arms. \nRAMIREZ I'm sorry... I'm sorry. \nCARLA Get your hands off me! \nRAMIREZ Shh... I'm not him... I'm not Carlos... I'm... \nCARLA I don't care who you are. I don't want to know anything about you... except that you're going to kill him. \nEXT. KGB HEADQUARTERS - MOSCOW - NIGHT \nINT. KGB OFFICE - NIGHT \nA HEAD KGB OFFICER is with a KGB AIDE. He reads a report. \nHEAD KGB OFFICER [It seems our friendly bank manager in Zurich has received instructions to put a new name on the account of our mysterious Mister Paulo Ortega... Agnieska Kozinski. Does the name sound familiar?] \nKGB AIDE [Should it?] \nHEAD KGB OFFICER [I ran a check on her. She's a French national... originally Polish. She was a girlfriend of Carlos.] \nKGB AIDE [Our Carlos?] \nHEAD KGB OFFICER [The question is... is he still our Carlos. Or is he about to become someone else's.] \nEXT. AGNIESKA'S APARTMENT - PARIS - DAY \nA beautiful young woman whom we will come to know as AGNIESKA enters her apartment building. \nSUPER: TRIPOLI, LIBYA - MAY 1987 \nINT. LIBYA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY \nA cold, dreary, oppressive airport. Grim-looking SOLDIERS and even more menacing SECURITY MEN in dark glasses. In the line of arriving PASSENGERS, at the passport control booth, is a limping Colombian businessman. Scanning the place from behind sunglasses, his heart is POUNDING, POUNDING, POUNDING. This is it. This is real enemy territory now, and he knows it. \nRAMIREZ'S POV \nThe foreboding paranoia that everyone is staring at him. Soldiers, security men, airport employees, other passengers. They all seem to know his secret. They're all just waiting for the axe to fall. Ramirez heads over to the Customs booth. He turns back as a guard pushes him aside to let pass a rich Arabic family. A young fat girl holding some toys grimaces at him as she indelicately makes her way with her family through the crowd. In the b.g. we notice a Mercedes waiting for them through the glass doors of the airport. Ramirez continues on his way towards the Customs booth. Behind a curtain, he sees a man being searched. \nOFFICIAL El Pass'port! \nThe sudden harsh voice jolts us all. \nCLOSE - OFFICIAL \nPockmarked face with exaggerated features. Ugly and mean. Ramirez hands him his Colombian passport. The POUNDING quickens. \nOFFICIAL Sheil el Nadara! \nHe barks in Arabic, motioning Ramirez to remove his sunglasses. Ramirez does, fighting to remain calm under the man's granite gaze. The official looks at the passport and back at Ramirez. The following dialogue is in Arabic with English subtitles. \nNow and for every other scene in which Ramirez passes himself off as Carlos, he has brown eyes. \nOFFICIAL Ricardo Moran Vargas? \nRAMIREZ Yes. \nCLOSE - RAMIREZ'S FACE \nTiny beads of sweat begin to form on his forehead. \nOFFICIAL Your business? \nRAMIREZ Pipes. I sell pipes. \nOFFICIAL Pipes? \nRamirez nods, smiling apologetically, searching for the words in Arabic. Ramirez struggles to appear calm. His heart's POUNDING, however, intensifies. \nRAMIREZ For the oil... \nOFFICIAL Oil? \nRAMIREZ Pipes for oil... Petroleum... \nOFFICIAL (after a beat) Step over behind the curtain. \nNEW ANGLE \nRamirez's luggage is being thoroughly searched by the Official. Finally the Official looks up at him. \nOFFICIAL All right. You can go. \nFinally he stamps the passport. \nEXT. LIBYA PALACE HOTEL - DAY \nWe have a shot of the cab, an old Mercedes coming towards us, and then under the arch leading to the entrance of the hotel. Ramirez steps out and he's assailed by a bunch of kids begging and trying to grab his baggage. He looks around. \nANGLE - POV RAMIREZ \nAcross the street at a cafe soldiers with guns laugh. From a shop window, the silhouette of a man seems to look right at us. Across the street, kids on a balcony throw a water balloon at a horse pulling a cart and the horse bolts right in front of Ramirez. \nBACK TO SCENE \nAs the street urchins continue to beg and grab at his luggage, and the taxi driver demands impatiently to be paid, suddenly out of nowhere, a bellboy appears and smacks one of the kids who falls to the ground. They all disperse as the bellboy takes the luggage and leads Ramirez who pays the cab driver and then crosses to the hotel. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - LIBYA - DAY \nThe bellboy enters with Ramirez, sets down his bags and then opens the shutters of the window. Ramirez tips him silently. Once the bellboy has left, Ramirez walks to the phone and checks it out. Then he crosses to the shutters. Perhaps he sees a shadow looking in his direction from the dark apartment across the street. He closes the shutters. Just then, there's a LOUD KNOCK on the door. He jumps and automatically goes for his gun. But he has no gun... and his heart begins to POUND again. The LOUD KNOCK repeats itself. \nRAMIREZ (in Spanish) Who's there? \nAn incomprehensible response in Arabic. \nRAMIREZ (in accented English) What do you want? \nVOICE Room service. \nRAMIREZ (after a pause) I not order nothing. \nVOICE Iced water. \nHe reaches up to his glasses and takes them off and his mustache and false nose... \nRAMIREZ Then I'm going to have something to eat... I'm famished. \nPRODUCTION NOTE: THE BEGINNING OF THIS SCENE SHOULD BE PLAYED WITH ANOTHER ACTOR SO THAT THE AUDIENCE HAS NO HINT THAT THIS IS RAMIREZ. THEN ON THE CUT WHERE HE TAKES OFF HIS GLASSES, IT SHOULD BE THE ACTOR PLAYING RAMIREZ, BUT HE IS BALD. \nAGNIESKA You bastard! I haven't see you for two years and this is the way you... \nRamirez laughs. \nRAMIREZ I had to be sure I could still trust you. \nHe bends down to her and kisses her. \nAGNIESKA I came all the way to this god- forsaken country didn't I? I've been holed up in this place you arranged for me for the past twenty-four hours... I couldn't eat I couldn't sleep... nothing just sitting in here waiting for you. \nHe picks her up in his arms and starts carrying her to the bed. \nRAMIREZ So why did you leave. . .? \nAGNIESKA Whoever stocked this place with food didn't leave much of a selection... I wanted to go out and get some nice things for you. You weren't supposed to be here for another three hours. I could have made a nice dinner. \nRAMIREZ I've got what I want to eat in my arms right now. \nHe lays her down on the bed and pulls up her skirt and his head goes down out of screen as Agnieska arches her back and sighs. \nEXT. HARBOR - LIBYA - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe silhouette of a fishing boat drifts along the coastline. \nINT. FISHING BOAT - LIBYA - LATE AFTERNOON \nWe see the silhouettes of two men against the out of focus backdrop of the city. They are Jack and Amos, chain smoking. Both men dressed as fishermen. Jack checks his watch. \nJACK I wonder what he's doing now. \nAMOS Practicing safe sex, I hope. \nINT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT IN LIBYA - SUNSET \nRamirez is in bed with Agnieska. She lays back smoking a cigarette, sighing. \nAGNIESKA My God... my God... \nRAMIREZ Yeah... Now, let's eat. \nHe gets up and throws on his pants and crosses into the little kitchen. Agnieska follows, draping a blanket around her. She crosses to a window and opens it. \nRAMIREZ What are you doing? \nAGNIESKA Just getting some air in here... Don't be so jumpy. \nHe turns back to the refrigerator and opens it. Agnieska crosses to the fallen sacks of groceries. \nAGNIESKA Forget about what's in there... I found caviar and, here's some pate. \nRAMIREZ Didn't like the food I'd left for you, huh? \nHis eyes scan the refrigerator. \nAGNIESKA Couldn't eat a bite of it. \nANGLE ON RAMIREZ \nHis eyes still scan. He pulls a cucumber out of the refrigerator and takes a bite and makes a face. \nRAMIREZ Ughhh... I don't blame you. \nHe opens the lid on the garbage can and throws the cucumber inside. \nANGLE ON INSIDE OF GARBAGE CAN \nAt the bottom are cigarette butts. CAMERA ZOOMS IN ON ONE - IT IS FILTER-TIPPED. \nRamirez turns around to her and comes up behind her. \nRAMIREZ Who was here smoking a filter-tip cigarette my darling? \nAGNIESKA What? \nRAMIREZ You don't smoke filters. \nAGNIESKA What are you talking about? \nEXT. SMALL ALLEY - NIGHT \nRamirez arrives at a small street. In the distance we SEE the lights of a bright and busy street. Suddenly, headlights hit his face, gunfire rings out and Ramirez takes off followed by the oncoming car. \nINT. COURTYARD - LIBYA - NIGHT \nRamirez is running from the car dodging bullets. Ramirez lobs a grenade at the car. It explodes right in front of the car, not taking it out, just damaging it. Ramirez runs across the street and is hit suddenly by a motorcycle which then veers off and goes crashing into an oncoming car. Ramirez gets up and runs into a doorway. \nINT. COURTYARD - LIBYA - NIGHT \nRamirez, sweating and out of breath, scans his new and dark surroundings. While bleeding, Ramirez suddenly turns around and shoots. A DST agent falls out of the darkness, dead. Ramirez hears something. Turning around, Ramirez shoots an agent at the top of the building. The body falls and gets tangled into the string of electrical wires. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out another clip and re-loads. \nEXT. STREET - LIBYA - NIGHT \nRamirez comes out of the doorway and waves down a taxi. Ramirez jumps into the driver's seat, pushing the driver aside. When the driver resists, Ramirez throws him out into the street. \nA passing truck nearly hits the driver. Other Arabs start approaching Ramirez but back off immediately once he raises his gun. The taxi makes a U-turn and leaves, racing through traffic. Ramirez checks his mirror and sees that he is picked up by a DST car. They begin to shoot at Ramirez and his back window shatters. \nEXT. SMALLER STREET - LIBYA - NIGHT \nRamirez is driving full speed. The car jumps as it hits the junction of the street. Ramirez continues to be followed by the car of DST agents. Ramirez turns into a small alley. \nEXT. NARROW STREET - LIBYA - NIGHT \nRamirez drives down the narrow street. The sides of the car barely fit through. Sparks fly from the metal scratching against the walls. The taxi's mirror pops off as the chase continues. \nEXT. SMALLER STREET WITH ARCHES - LIBYA - NIGHT \nThe cars continue to race through the streets. Ramirez suddenly sees two kids coming out of a garage. Ramirez veers out of the way and misses the kids. The car goes crashing into scaffolding and paint drops down onto the windshield. Once again, we Intercut the flashback of Ramirez killing the first DST agent, being splattered with his blood. Ramirez continues to drive away, wiping away the paint on the windshield. \nEXT. SMALLER STREET WITH CAFE - LIBYA - NIGHT \nRamirez tries to wipe away the paint. The cars continue to race through the streets. \nEXT. STREET - LIBYA - NIGHT \nThe two cars disappear down a hill. Ramirez's vision is blurred by the paint on the windshield. A car suddenly appears that forces him to veer left into a stairwell. The taxi descends the stairway. Ramirez suddenly pulls the parking brake and the other car hits Ramirez's car and flips over it and explodes. Ramirez, watching the explosion, takes off the other way. \nEXT. STREET IN LIBYA - NIGHT \nOn the harbor, a police car is seen next to Ramirez's taxi. The sergeant reveals some blood inside the taxi but Ramirez is nowhere to be found. We SEE the KGB on the scene. \nEXT. HARBOR - LIBYA - NIGHT \nThe fishing boat enters the harbor. Jack stands on the deck as the boat passes under a bridge. Out of nowhere a man jumps onto Jack and shoves him to the ground. Holding him by the neck, Amos appears and is about to hit Ramirez but Ramirez grabs Amos' arm and stares at him. \nEXT. VILLA - LIBYA - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING SHOT \nWe SEE Carlos' villa through the barbed wire. The silhouette of a guard is on top of the building. \nINT. VILLA BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe real Carlos is asleep in the bed with a beautiful Arabic woman. A Japanese KOJ enters and taps Carlos on the shoulder. Instantly he springs awake with a gun in his hand pointed at KOJ. \nKOJ Illich... you must get dressed. There was a shooting tonight... We have to talk. \nCARLOS What shooting... who? \nEXT. FISHING BOAT AT SEA - NIGHT \nINT. FISHING BOAT - NIGHT \nJack and Amos are with Ramirez who is furious. Amos is binding Ramirez's wounds. \nRAMIREZ What the fuck are you talking about, you didn't know she was working with the DST? \nJACK We didn't. How the fuck should we know? \nRAMIREZ They're our allies, for Christ's sake! \nJACK They didn't tell us this time. Why should they it was their operation. And we sure as shit weren't gonna let them in on you being here. \nRAMIREZ Why not?! That way they wouldn't have tried to kill me and I wouldn't have wound up killing them. \nAMOS It would have been too dangerous. \nRAMIREZ Too dangerous... what the fuck do you think that was back there? Safe? How the fuck more dangerous does it have to get? \nJACK Annibal, the important thing was it worked! The Russians have to think it was Carlos now... . What did they see? They trail the girl... and then there's a shoot out. Let's make sure they know it was DST... we can make sure they get that information. If they know the DST was there then what were they doing there if it wasn't to get Carlos. She betrayed you, so tomorrow we take her name off the bank account and we set up another place for them to get their pictures. We burned Libya but okay so we'll find another place. The only thing that matters is they've got to believe it now. It's perfect! \nRAMIREZ You fuckin' maniac! I killed four DST agents tonight! They're our allies and they were tryin' to kill me and I killed them. I killed our allies! \nJACK Hey fuck our allies! \nJACK No, go right ahead. \nRamirez sits down and now the conversation is in hushed tones. \nRAMIREZ I want to go home. I want to see my family. \nJACK This isn't the place for this conversation. \nRAMIREZ (pissed off) No rules, remember? I want to go home. You said yourself we can't move again till he leaves Libya. You don't even know when that's gonna be. He might stay there another year for Christ's sake. \nJACK No he won't. He's gonna make a move and it'll be in Europe just to stick it up the DST's nose. I'm gonna go and find out about our connecting flight. \nANGLE ON - RAMIREZ \nHe picks up his soup spoon and turns it over and uses it to scan what's going on around him. \nANGLE ON - SPOON \nIN the spoon we SEE Koj with a flight bag walking across the cafeteria toward Ramirez. \nBACK TO SCENE \nKoj crosses around in front of Ramirez to get a better look, obviously surprised to see what he thinks is Carlos. Koj leans in close to Ramirez. \nKOJ (whispering) Carlos... what are you doing here? \nRamirez looks at him, shocked for a moment and then recovering. \nRAMIREZ (hissing) You idiot! Don't you know better than to approach me in public! \nKOJ (loudly) Excuse me sir... I only wanted to know where I could buy a newspaper. \nRAMIREZ Go over there by the phone booths and wait... I'll come to you. \nRamirez gets up casually. \nANGLE ON - AMOS \nHe has heard everything that has gone down. \nANGLE ON - KOJ \nHe waits, standing a few feet away and not by the phones as he was told. He watches Ramirez. Something doesn't jibe... passwords were not exchanged. He crosses to Ramirez's side. \nKOJ (loudly) Excuse me sir... I asked if you knew where I could buy a newspaper. \nRamirez stops for a moment. He knows that the line is some kind of code and he has no response to give so he starts up walking again. Koj is instantly behind Ramirez, his hand going into his flight bag and pushing the flight bag up against Ramirez's back. \nKOJ Make the slightest move and I shoot... and I don't miss. Walk to the rest room, very carefully. \nRamirez does as he is told. \nANGLE ON \nAmos. He watches it all going down in the back of a chrome napkin holder. He slowly gets up, looks around for Jack and goes out into the corridor and sees Koj and Ramirez going into the rest room. Koj sees one of those sandwich board signs off to the side which says, \"LAVATORY TEMPORARILY CLOSED FOR CLEANING.\" He pulls it in front of the door. \nINT. RESTROOM - STALL - HEATHROW AIRPORT - DAY \nKoj has Ramirez's head with one hand, while he holds the gun on him with the other. He forces Ramirez's head down deep into the toilet bowl. He flushes. The water level sinks and then rises, covering Ramirez's face. Koj holds him under water long enough to almost drown him. Then, instead of lifting his head out, he flushes again and the water level lowers. \nKOJ Tell me what I want to know quickly or you're dead. \nJust then Ramirez manages to kick back and overpower Koj and send him flying back out through the door of the stall. Ramirez is back on him in a second but Koj has his gun up and pointed right at Ramirez's head. They have shifted position now, so that they are not facing the stall, but the door of the bathroom. Koj is about to pull the trigger when we HEAR: \nAMOS (O.S.) Down!! \nNEW ANGLE \nRamirez ducks and rolls out of the way and Amos fires two shots into Koj's chest but not before Koj can get off a round right into Amos' chest. In an instant Ramirez is on the still- alive Koj grabbing his head in his hands and slamming it down onto the edge of the sink with a thud that cracks his skull. He quickly crosses to Amos who is dying. \nAMOS Get out of here... now... \nRAMIREZ I've got to get you to a doctor. \nAMOS Get out now... \nRamirez cradles him. \nRAMIREZ I'm not going to let you die here... I've still got a lawsuit against you, remember? \nHere, Amos speaks as a doomed father would to a son who still has a chance to save himself from the Holocaust. \nAMOS My dear boy... my dear dear boy... I am dead. Please God, don't let it all be for nothing... Get out now... \nCUT TO: \nINT. RAMIREZ HOUSE - STUDY - VIRGINIA - NIGHT \nWe begin on a shot of Ramirez's chair. It rocks back and forth violently as we PAN UP and SEE Ramirez, who is fucking Maura. They are both fully clothed, skirt hiked up, fly unzipped. This is not lovemaking. He is fucking her brains out. It is passionate, rough sex. Maura hits high \"C\" as Ramirez sweeps books off of a table, lifts her out of the chair and lays her out on the table. The two of them climax together. It is clear from Maura's look that this is the best sex she's ever had. Ramirez slowly rolls off her. He is smiling as well, and then becomes aware that Maura has begun to cry. \nRAMIREZ What's wrong? \nMAURA You've been with another woman... haven't you. \nRAMIREZ What are you talking about? \nMAURA Haven't you? \nRAMIREZ No. What... what would make you say a thing like that? \nMAURA You're different... \nRAMIREZ Maura... I was on a submarine... there aren't any women on submarines... There was nothin' to do but read. They had one of those... how to improve your sex life books... I must have read it about ten times. I tried out a couple of things from chapter three okay? I mean if it didn't turn you on blame Doctor Ruth okay? \nMAURA (unconvinced) Okay. \nRAMIREZ Great. You want to check with the Navy to see if we had shore leave... I'll get you a fuckin' letter okay? \nMAURA I don't need any letters. And I don't need you to talk to me like that either. \nRamirez gets up and zips up his fly. \nMAURA Where are you going? \nRAMIREZ Get somethin' to eat... I'm starving. \nHe exits. \nEXT. RAMIREZ HOME - DAY \nSUPER: JULY, 1987 \nINT. RAMIREZ HOME - DAY \nRamirez comes into the house from the garage. \nRAMIREZ Maura... Maura! \nMaura comes out of the kitchen. \nMAURA What? \nRAMIREZ Where's the car? The car's not in the garage. Where's the car? \nMAURA The fellow at the service station said it needed a tune up. I took it in this morning... You didn't say you were going to need it. \nRAMIREZ Don't do that anymore. \nMAURA What? \nRAMIREZ I don't want anybody workin' on the car. Car needs something I'll do it. But I don't want anybody touchin' that car. \nMAURA Why? What difference does it make. \nRAMIREZ It makes a difference to me okay? So don't do it. \nMAURA Did you check the mail? \nRAMIREZ Yeah I checked the mail. Still nothin' from the Navy. Why, you so anxious to get rid of me? \nMAURA I don't want you goin' back to those subs. I'll tell you that. \nRAMIREZ Yeah well I don't have much to say about it. It's the Navy you know. \nMAURA You can request another assignment. It's changed you Annibal. It's hurting us. \nRAMIREZ What's hurting us? \nMAURA Your attitude... that's what hurting us. \nRAMIREZ My attitude. I don't have an attitude man... you got an attitude. \nMAURA You're suspicious of everything that goes on... you snap at Joey, you snap at me. I don't like it. \nRAMIREZ Look I just... it's hard gettin' used to... you know... it's hard... Listen... tomorrow's Joey's game. Let's just go to Joey's game. It'll be nice. It'll be like it always was. You'll see. \nHe holds her to him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - MARYLAND - DAY \nThe cell's metal door SCRAPES as it opens. The POLICE CAPTAIN motions to Ramirez to follow him. \nMOVING \nLeading Ramirez through a number of corridors, the Captain stops at a closed door. \nCAPTAIN (opening the door) He's all yours. \nRemaining outside he motions Ramirez to enter. \nINT. ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY \nRamirez enters and sees Jack who smiles his cynical smile. \nJACK Little League, huh? Tough game. \nRAMIREZ What are you doing here? \nJACK It's show time. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - MARYLAND - DAY - RAIN \nRamirez exits with Jack and starts across the street in the rain. \nRAMIREZ I got to have time to think it over. \nJACK There isn't any time. He's on his way to East Berlin. We have word he's planning another attack in Europe. He'll be there maybe four days at the most. \nRamirez stops dead right in the middle of the street. The traffic swirls around them. \nRAMIREZ Hey, I don't know what to do anymore, okay? I almost killed some little kid's father today. I don't know about anything anymore. \nJACK Hey, he was a baseball dad. He deserved it. Besides, from what I heard his kid was out, so what's the beef? \nRAMIREZ I don't know if I could come back from it again. \nJACK What happened to I want the son of a bitch dead? You think Carlos has had a change of heart and turned nice all of a sudden? \nRAMIREZ Don't tell me about Carlos, Jack. I know exactly who Carlos is. I know a hell of a lot better than you do. But, maybe there's more important things to me, like keepin' from goin' crazy... like gettin' back to bein' me instead of me bein' some kind of fuckin' maniac. \nJACK You want to get back to bein' you? Then finish it. Kill him. Kill him and he's dead and it's over with. You walk away from it now and what do you think you're gonna be like the next time you read that that son of a bitch blew up some airplane full of women and kids. \nRAMIREZ Hey, the guy deserves to be dead. I know that. \nJACK This isn't abstract, Annibal. You're walkin' around with his face. Sooner or later one of the bad guys is gonna see it like Koj did, and next time Amos won't be there to take the bullet for you. Carlos doesn't forget. You help me get him or you're never gonna know when he's comin' after you... Listen to me kid. I don't have any friends, no family, no nothin'. The only relationships I ever had that mattered to me were with the people I killed. But I... I fucking created you! You can't just walk away now. \nRAMIREZ You did create me, didn't you... From the beginning... that kid in the hospital in Bethesda... when I was supposed to be the doctor... It was all bullshit, wasn't it? All an act... \nThere is a long pause. Jack turns cold as ice. \nJACK This doesn't have anything to do with you and me. It's you and Carlos. You help me kill him... or I swear to you... I'll make sure he knows about you... I'll use you for bait. You and your whole fuckin' family too. \nRamirez grabs him and throws him against a parked car. He begins choking Jack. He may well kill him. Though Ramirez doesn't see it at first, Jack's gun is already out. Jack nudges Ramirez in the stomach with it. Jack is choking, unable to speak, but the gun is speaking for him. \nJACK Huh? Huh? \nRamirez looks down and see the gun and loosens his grip. \nJACK You want to try and kill me, that doesn't solve your problem, pally. You've got a Carlos problem. That's the guy you've got to kill. That's what it's all about now... you... and your family... or him. \nINT. RAMIREZ HOME - KITCHEN - VIRGINIA - NIGHT \nRamirez is there alone with Maura. They are in mid-argument. \nMAURA No! I won't let you do it! You're not going back to those subs! It's changed you... You need help, Annibal. You could get some kind of stress disability or... \nSuddenly, Ramirez bellows and slams his hand down on the counter. \nRAMIREZ Enough! \nMaura is shocked by the sudden violence in him. \nMAURA No, not enough. Whatever is going on out there with your job... \nRAMIREZ With my job!? What do you think my job is, Maura... huh? What do you think is out there? A nice, pretty safe little world with shopping malls and little league and ballet lessons. You sit here in your little kitchen and cook your little meals... \nHe looks at her almost in disgust. She sees the look and slaps him. Faster than she could ever have considered, he slaps her and sends her back into the wall. She holds her cheek. He is an inch away from her face and now he is about to show her Carlos, to become him in front of her. \nRAMIREZ People are killing people out there! Jackals are licking up their blood waiting for the next corpse to drop... and I'm one of them. You get that? Do you get that now?! \nMaura is there with Ramirez. He is in mid-conversation with her. We don't know how long she's been there. He opens his eyes. \nMAURA Is it over? \nRAMIREZ No. \nShe crosses to him and gently takes his hand in hers. \nRAMIREZ You have to make a new life for yourself and the children. \nMAURA No. \nRAMIREZ Maura, anytime I start a car I'll wonder if this is the one that explodes. I couldn't bear the thought of you and the children being in that danger. He'll want me and everyone I've ever loved to be dead. Trust me... I know how he thinks because it's the way I think now too. I am so... sorry. I am so sorry... \nMaura looks at him imploring him with her eyes. \nMAURA I won't leave you. \nRAMIREZ Maura, when my father was put into prison he told my mother to take me and leave and start a new life. That's what you've got to do. \nMAURA You're not in prison and I'm not your mother and I won't leave you. I will not let him do this to us. Not him... not the CIA... not anyone. \nRAMIREZ He'll come after me. \nMAURA Get me a gun and teach me to shoot and he'll have to deal with both of us. This animal will not destroy my family. Please... come home. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. RAMIREZ HOME - VIRGINIA - DAY \nWe hear a phone ring and it is picked up. \nMAURA (O.S.; THRU PHONE) Hello... \nWe hear the voice of a friend of hers named GRACE. \nGRACE (O.S.; THRU PHONE) Hi... listen, do you and Annibal want to come over with the kids for a barbeque this afternoon? \nMAURA (O.S.; THRU PHONE) Uh sure, I think... but could I call you back later? We're just about to go to church. Annibal and the kids are already in the car. \nGRACE (O.S.; THRU PHONE) Okay, call me when you get back. \nMAURA (O.S.; THRU PHONE) Great. Talk to you later. Bye bye. \nWe hear the phone hang up. We hear the sound of a door opening and closing that leads into the garage from the house. We hear the sound of a car door opening. And then the key turning in an ignition. And then the door is blown off the garage as we see the Ramirez family car burst into an inferno and blaze away inside the garage in a fiery blast which would kill one and all instantly. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nThe cemetery is set up for a funeral. There are various Navy officers and their families in the chairs. At the back of it all stands Jack wearing sunglasses, his face a mask into which it is impossible to read any emotion of any kind. There are four graves and four coffins, two adult-sized and two small ones. Admiral Crawford addresses the mourners. \nCRAWFORD How does one even begin to comprehend a tragedy like this. A highly respected Naval officer returns from six months of hazardous duty. He has escaped the danger we all come to know in the service of our country. He is about to go to church with his beloved family and in an instant... they are no more. They are with God. Our minds cannot comprehend such tragedy... only an undying faith in the Almighty a faith that says even though we cannot see it, there is a plan. That and the knowledge that as in life, so for eternity are they together... \nANGLE ON JACK \nHe whispers to himself as he takes off his sunglasses. \nJACK Now you're free. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ST. MARTIN - DAY \nIt is a beautiful island community with clusters of villas overlooking a magnificent coastline. A postal truck winds its way towards one of the houses. \nThe POSTMAN gets out of his truck and crosses to the door of the house. He knocks on the door. The door opens... it is Ramirez... or Carlos... we don't know which. He wears shorts and a shirt. \nPOSTMAN Mister Mendoza? \nMENDOZA Yes. \nPOSTMAN Special delivery letter for you sir. \nThe Postman hands the man an envelope. He signs for it and opens the envelope. It is a newspaper clipping... \nANGLE ON THE NEWSPAPER CLIPPING \nThe headline is: NAVAL OFFICER AND FAMILY KILLED IN FIERY CRASH. There is a handwritten note attached. It says, \"Rest in Peace.\" \nPOSTMAN Not bad news I hope. \nMENDOZA Someone... died. \n", "test1_input": "SCOTT I love it! Those cocky Israeli bastards thought they hit the jackpot. Got the Jackal right in their own backyard... \nMONROE State Department's goin' apeshit. And the Navy... Admiral Trost was so pissed he was ready to shell the port of Haifa. \nJack, however, isn't sniggering. He's thinking hard as he looks at all the information on the desk. \nJACK You're not gettin' it are ya? \nSCOTT What? \nJACK These weren't some yokels... This was the Israeli General Security Service... The Mossad. The best in the business. They have the most complete dossier there is on Carlos, the latest pictures of him... everything. I mean what's that tell you? \nSCOTT That they really ate it this time. \nJACK Scott... doesn't it hurt to walk around like that with your head up your ass... I mean isn't it painful? \nHis eyes glance down to the pictures, especially the photos of the children. Something begins to click. \nEXT. NORFOLK, VA - DAY \nSUPER: NORFOLK, VIRGINIA \nEXT. T-BALL FIELD - NORFOLK, VA - DAY \nAlmost nothing is as cute as 3 foot 5 inch 6-year-olds struggling to play the most elementary form of baseball, T- ball. \nANGLE ON - 6 - YEAR-OLD JOEY RAMIREZ \nHe is the first baseman and he is intent upon the batter who stands at the T. \nANGLE ON - THE PARENTS \ncheering their kids on. Amongst them we recognize MAURA, Annibal Ramirez's wife, who is cheering for her son's team. She holds a ten month old baby as she cheers. \nNEW ANGLE \non Annibal Ramirez, resplendent in his summer whites, his face still showing the faintest remnants of bruises at the hands of the Israelis. He holds his sea bag in his hand. There is a waiting taxi behind him as he strides over towards the baseball diamond. \nANGLE ON - JOEY \nHe sees his father just as the batter hits the ball. \nJOEY Poppi! \nThe pitcher scoops the grounder up and tosses it to Joey whose eyes however have lit up at the sight of his sailor father home from the sea so the ball hits him in the side of the head and he goes down. Ramirez wants to rush out to his son, but Joey straightens himself up quickly, not wanting to be embarrassed by an over-protective parent. \nANGLE ON - MAURA AND RAMIREZ \nMaura has followed her son's gaze at Ramirez and feels no embarrassment whatsoever as she runs into his arms, still holding her baby. She kisses him. \nMAURA I thought you weren't coming back till tomorrow... \nRAMIREZ I wanted to be here for his game. Look how beautiful she is! \nHe picks up the baby and kisses her. \nRAMIREZ Just like her mother. \nMAURA What happened to your eye? \nRAMIREZ Nothing. Just fell. It doesn't matter. I'm home. \nEXT. RAMIREZ'S HOUSE - NORFOLK - A MONTH LATER - DAY \nIt's a stucco, single-level structure in a clean, middle income neighborhood. Jack Shaw pulls up, crosses out of his car and knocks on the door. The door opens revealing Ramirez in a T-shirt and pair of sweats. Jack looks at his face, the unmistakable face of Carlos. \nRAMIREZ Joey watch Yolanda... okay? \nJACK Jesus... \nRAMIREZ I beg your pardon? \nJACK Lieutenant Commander Ramirez my name is Jack Shaw... I'm with the government... I'd like to talk to you about what happened in Israel. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RAMIREZ HOUSE - BACKYARD - NORFOLK - DAY \nANGLE - CLOSE ON \nthe barbeque's coals which burst into flame as fluid and then match are applied. OVER this we hear \nRAMIREZ I want to sue them, okay? I want to sue the guy who broke my ribs. I want to sue their government and their Mossad... and I want to sue Golda Meir! \n", "test1_true": "They stand at the barbeque as Joey plays shooting hoops. Ramirez holds Yolanda. Ramirez and Jack speak quietly. \nJACK Mrs. Meir is dead, Lieutenant Commander. \nRAMIREZ Then you might want to have them dig her up because I intend to sue her. \nJack chuckles. \nJACK Commander Ramirez when I said I was from the government, perhaps I should have been more specific. I'm from the CIA. \nJack reaches down, opens his briefcase and pulls out a large photo album-like briefing book. He opens it up and hands it to Ramirez. On the first page there is an 8\u00d710 enlargement of a photo of Carlos entering a building. It is grainy but it certainly looks exactly like Ramirez. \nJACK Does the man in that picture look familiar? \nRamirez looks at the picture with the same look on his face that Jack had when he saw Ramirez for the first time. \nYOLANDA Poppi... \nRAMIREZ That's not me... I mean I know it looks like me... but... \nJACK I know it's not you. \nRAMIREZ It's... this Carlos guy. \nJust then, Joey yells from the tree he's in. Jack automatically hides the picture as if the kid were from a rival intelligence agency. \nJOEY Poppi, you don't need to watch the fire, come climb with me. \nRAMIREZ Get out of that tree, Joey. Your mother sees that and I'm dead. \nNow when Jack speaks it is more guarded and in even quieter tones. \nJACK This is the only recent shot we have of him... telescopic lens from half a mile away taken by the Israelis. Can you blame 'em for what happened? The only difference is the eyes. \nRamirez looks at the picture in shock at the resemblance. \nRAMIREZ Okay I get it now, you're here to talk me out of my lawsuit. But see I identified myself but they kept me in that cell for two more days chained to that wall after I told 'em who I was so... \nJACK Lieutenant Commander, I am not here about your lawsuit. Carlos is the single most vicious terrorist in the world. He's personally carried out or masterminded the worst terrorist attacks in modern history. Men, women, children. Children like yours... blown to bits or slaughtered in cold blood. Annibal... why did you join the Navy? \nRAMIREZ (as if by rote) To serve my country. \nJACK To serve your country... to protect her from her enemies. Well Carlos is one of her enemies now. And he'll probably become a bigger one... terrorism... unfortunately is a growth industry. \nRAMIREZ Why are you telling me all this? \nJACK Lieutenant Commander, the governments of most countries in the free world have been after Carlos for ten years and we have nothing to show for it. There is exactly one person in the world who can help us get Carlos. And that person is you. \nRAMIREZ What do you mean... to get him? \nJACK All I can tell you is it may take as much as six months to a year of preparation. It will involve a high degree of risk. That much said, you may never as much as lay eyes on him yourself. But if we succeed Carlos won't be a threat to anyone anymore. Now I know you're going to need some time to think about it so... \nRAMIREZ No I don't need any time. The answer's no. \nJACK Annibal... \nRAMIREZ Lieutenant Commander... I am a Naval Officer... that's what I was trained for... that's what I'm good at... See you came to the wrong address. You want James Bond. He lives in London and he's got an Aston Martin. You can't miss him. \nWe HOLD on Ramirez's look and Jack's half-smile. \nINT. OFFICERS' CLUB - NAVAL BASE - NORFOLK - EVENING \nThe Officers' Club is decked out for a reception for ADMIRAL CRAWFORD. All the officers are in dress whites and all the wives wear white gloves and cocktail dresses as a Navy string quartet plays softly in b.g. There is a reception line and the Admiral stands with his aide who introduces each of the guests who pass through the line. \nNAVAL AIDE Admiral Crawford this is Commander and Mrs. Ward Scowcroft. \nCRAWFORD I know your family well, Commander, I was with your father at the Academy. I expect great things from you Ward... great things. \nSCOWCROFT I won't let you down sir. \nNext up are Ramirez and his wife Maura. \nNAVAL AIDE Admiral Crawford this is Lieutenant Commander and Mrs. Annibal Ramirez. \nCRAWFORD Annabelle?! \nRAMIREZ (smiling) It's Annibal sir. \nCRAWFORD Yes... of course... well ... I'm glad to see we're getting some Mexican American officers in the ranks. I'm an L.A. boy myself so I have a real soft spot for authentic Mexican food... My stomach doesn't always go along with it but... \nMAURA We'd love to have you over to dinner Admiral but the cuisine would be Cuban not Mexican. I think your stomach would find it more agreeable... not to mention your taste buds. \nCRAWFORD You're Cuban Americans... oh I'm sorry... you grow up in L.A. and you hear Ramirez and... anyway it was a pleasure meeting you. \n", "test2_input": "Entering the place, they pretend to be camera-carrying Russian tourists. A common sight in East Berlin. \nON RAMIREZ \nHe stops and stares. \nRAMIREZ'S POV \nThrough the jam pack, the profile of a man, with a Tyrol hat who sits along the back wall. Busy eating, he seems totally oblivious to the hoopla around him. We can't really see his face. \nON RAMIREZ \nAs he cautiously approaches what he thinks is Jack. It isn't him. There is a sudden look of panic on his face and then he spots Jack also in the same kind of hat. Lifting his head, and turning to face Ramirez, we too recognize him. Under the hat, and the new heavy eyebrows and mustache, is... Jack. He smiles, takes off his hat, and motions his quest to sit down. \nON ANDREI (THROUGH IVAN'S CAMERA) \nHe's posing with a giant stein. A slight shift of focus and we can see Ramirez. Jack, however, is hidden by the waiter's back. Then, the Waiter moves on. \nZOOM \nA clear, unobstructed picture of Jack and Ramirez up close. \nCLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK... The rapid CLICKING stops only when the view of the two is blocked again by other people. \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE BEER HALL - DUSK \nRamirez emerges from the beer hall. He heads back to his motorbike. \nANGLE \nSeconds later, the two KGB come out. This time, only Andrei takes after Ramirez. Ivan gets into a taxi which heads in an opposite direction. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANSION - NIGHT \nReaching the mansion, Ramirez discreetly steals his way toward its back wall. Then, just as slyly as he earlier had materialized, he disappears. \nON VLADIMIR AT HIS POST \nWatching Ramirez vanish into the mansion wall. \nEXT. RAMIREZ'S HIDING PLACE - NEAR MANSION - NIGHT \nHe lies in the thick bushes, completely obscured from anyone's view and now he removes the blond wig and the rest of his disguise. Underneath his \"disguise\" clothes, he is wearing a pair of black jeans and black T-shirt. He looks exactly like Carlos now. \nPRODUCTION NOTE: IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. THE REAL CARLOS HAS NOT DYED HIS HAIR BLOND. THIS WAS NOT THE REASON FOR RAMIREZ PUTTING ON A BLOND WIG. THE LOGIC HERE IS THAT IF THE \"REAL CARLOS\" WERE IN FACT GOING TO A MEET WITH A CIA AGENT, HE WOULD HAVE PUT ON SUCH A DISGUISE TO MAKE SURE HE WAS NOT SPOTTED BY THE RUSSIANS. \nINT. BLACK VOLGA - EAST BERLIN - NIGHT \nJack takes off his disguise as he drives the Volga to the appointed corner of Carlos' compound. He looks at his watch. reads: 9:15 as he slows the car to a crawl. \nJACK (to himself) Come on... come on... \nEXT. RAMIREZ'S HIDING PLACE - NEAR MANSION - NIGHT \nRamirez watches as Jack cruises by. \nRAMIREZ Not till he's dead, Jack. Not till he's dead. \nINT. BLACK VOLGA - EAST BERLIN - NIGHT \nJack sees that Ramirez is not going to show. \nJACK Shit. \nINT. KGB HEADQUARTERS - EAST BERLIN - NIGHT CLOSE ON MONITOR SCREEN \nA head shot of Ramirez in his latest blond, bearded disguise. Grainy and blurred at first, it's gradually being brought into sharp focus. \nPULL BACK to reveal a GROUP OF MEN closely watching the screen of an impressive, state-of-the-art computer. We recognize only one of them. Andrei. At the computer's sophisticated keyboard -- manipulating the images on the screen -- are TWO TECHNICIANS in white overalls. Right behind them stands the Head KGB Officer from Moscow and his Aide. \nHEAD KGB OFFICER (orders the technicians) [Now Carlos.] \nON SCREEN \nIt bisects, to allow a picture of the real Jackal (the splitting image of Ramirez) to appear on the right half of the screen. \nBACK TO SCENE \nThe Head KGB Officer puts on his glasses and takes a closer look at the monitor. \nHEAD KGB OFFICER [The beard and moustache.] \n", "test2_true": "CLOSE - SCREEN \nThe beard and moustache on Ramirez' disguised image slowly disappear. The two faces look very similar. \nCLOSE - SCREEN \nA huge nose covers the entire left half of the screen. \nZOOM \nThe upper part of the nose only. And... the incriminating hairline where the bogus schnoz had been superimposed on the real one. \nTECHNICIAN (O.S.) [The nose is a fake.] \nHEAD KGB OFFICER [Match the nose. And get rid of this wig...] \nAs the aquiline nose assumes the shape of the Jackal's -- the hair changes both color and form to match his -- the two faces on the screen become identical. \nHEAD KGB OFFICER [Have you identified the one he was meeting with?] \nTECHNICIAN [His name is Jack Shaw. CIA Counterterrorism.] \nThe Head KGB Officer turns to his Aide. \nHEAD KGB OFFICER [Get me the MFS on the secure phone. I want them out of the way.] \nEXT. MANSION - NIGHT ON MANSION GATE \nIt opens slowly. One by one, a half dozen MFS -- including the two we've seen earlier -- sneak out. Just as furtively, armed KGB -- led by the Head KGB Officer and his Aide move in through the still-open door. \nEXT. RAMIREZ'S HIDING PLACE - NEAR MANSION - NIGHT \nHe watches the KGB men enter the compound. \nRAMIREZ (sotto voce) Don't blow it Comrades... kill him. \nINT. MANSION \nMeeting no resistance on the ground floor -- whose security apparently has been the task of the MFS -- the intruders climb the open, spiral staircase. They move cautiously, silencer-equipped weapons in hand. \nANGLE \nReaching the upper floor, they hear the muffled sound of RHYTHMIC MUSIC coming from the far end of the hallway to their right. The Head KGB Officer motions his Aide to move into the corridor to their left. He does, taking three KGB with him. Four others -- including Andrei and Ivan -- follow the Head KGB Officer into the hallway to their right. \nINT. HALLWAY \nIt's long, with several rooms on each side. As Vladimir moves gingerly into the first one, Ivan covers him from the door. \nINT. ROOM \nIlluminated only by the light which filters through the open door, the room is quite dark. A faint sound of SNORING reaches Andrei from the bed closest to the door. Quickly there, his arm goes up. Then, for a split second, the flash of metal as the knife comes down hard. The victim's last MURMUR. Followed by the SOUND OF MOVEMENT at the other bed. \nANGLE \nIn the beam of Ivan's flashlight, a waking JAPANESE is reaching for his gun. Pffft. Pfffft. And he too falls back to sleep. Eternally. \nINT. ANOTHER ROOM - MANSION \nTWO more JAPANESE in the midst of a Go game meet the same fate. A burst from Head KGB Officer's automatic finishes them off. \nINT. HALLWAY AND OTHER ROOMS - MANSION \nDoing away with several more of Carlos' multinational gang, the five KGB finally reach the room with the large, heavy French doors at the end of hallway. \nINT. OUTSIDE CARLOS' BEDROOM \nQuietly approaching the carved-wood doors, a KGB tries the knobs. The doors are locked. Suddenly, the pulsating LATIN BEAT which emanated continuously from behind the doors, stops. \nON HEAD KGB OFFICER \nHe's startled by the sudden silence. \nHEAD KGB OFFICER (whispering) [Quick! Quick!] \nNot wasting any time, Andrei and Ivan kick the doors open. Diving to the side, they cover the other two KGB who storm in with their Kalashnikovs very much at the ready. \nINT. CARLOS' BEDROOM - MANSION ON CARLOS' BED \nThe voluptuous blonde -- her body glazed with post-coitus sweat -- is paralyzed with fear; covering her prized assets seems the last thing on her mind. She gapes at the KGB marauders with wide, blue eyes. Not so, Ramirez's look-alike. Caught reaching from under the sheets to replace the tape in the stereo by the bed, he instinctively tries for his gun. \nON HEAD KGB OFFICER \nStanding at the door. His automatic no longer has a silencer. \n", "test3_input": "HEAD KGB OFFICER (sarcastic) Don't even think about it. It would deprive the KGB of the pleasure of interrogating you. \nON CARLOS \nSurprisingly, he seems quite relieved. \nCARLOS KGB? I thought... \nBACK TO SCENE \nHEAD KGB OFFICER What? That we were your new friends... The CIA... Jack Shaw... \nCARLOS Jack Shaw...? \nHEAD KGB OFFICER Stop playing games. And it's no use looking behind me... Your associates can no longer be of assistance. Not to you, not to anyone... \nCARLOS (angry) Comrade, you'd getter have an explanation -- \nHEAD KGB OFFICER You've got it all wrong, Illich. It's you who has all the explaining to do... Now get dressed! (to the blonde) You too, Fraulein. \nCARLOS My pants... \nThe Head KGB Officer motions to Andrei, who throws Carlos his pants -- but not before checking to make sure there's no weapon in them. He then hands the blonde -- who finally hides her bazooms behind a sheet -- her clothes. \nCARLOS (continuing; getting dressed) That's what was going on in Libya. The CIA... The DST... They're trying to set me up and you're falling for it, you idiot! \nHEAD KGB OFFICER Enough. We tailed you to your meeting. We have the pictures of you with Shaw. \nCARLOS That's impossible. I've been here all night. (points to the blonde) Ask her. (to the blonde) Tell him. \nON BLONDE \nShe's putting stockings on a pair of legs that could distract even the most committed KGB. \nBLONDE (in a voice matching her looks) It's true. All night... \nHEAD KGB OFFICER (unimpressed) We know about your women... Now hurry up, both of you! \nON IVAN AND VLADIMIR \nWith Kalashnikovs still trained on Carlos, they seem unable to resist stealing glances at the blonde. \nCARLOS (to Head KGB Officer) I'll prove it to you. You'll be pleading for my forgiveness. Let's just go. I want to be interrogated. I demand to be interrogated. \nHe seems truly eager to leave with them now, as if confident he can prove his case. Dressed, with the exception of a jacket, he casually grabs one which lies on a nearby chair. \nHEAD KGB OFFICER WAIT! \nToo late. The Scorpion machine-pistol is already out, spouting deadly accurate fire. He kills the Head KGB Officer first, then... \nON KGB \nThey drop like flies, their bullets hitting everything but him. \nON BLONDE \nHysterical, she screams her healthy lungs out. \nINT. HALLWAY - MANSION \nSuddenly there's the sound of APPROACHING STEPS. The KGB are down the corridor, rushing to the bedroom, led by the Aide. \nON CARLOS \nHe doesn't hesitate. Firing a few rounds at them, he sprints toward the window and literally flies through its shattering glass. \nEXT. MANSION - TREES - NIGHT \nRamirez lies in some bushes about fifty yards from the house, dressed in the black jeans and T-shirt. He hears the gunfire from the mansion. \nRAMIREZ What the fuck? \nEXT. MANSION COURTYARD \nIt's a dark night, and only a few dim lights illuminate the rather large back yard. \nON CARLOS \nLanding in a bed of flowers, he rolls, and is quickly on his feet with the machine-pistol in hand. \nON TWO ARMED KGB \nSecuring the courtyard, they rush to the spot where, apparently, they'd seen him land. Carlos, however, is no longer there. \n", "test3_true": "Glued to the back of a tree, the Jackal cuts them down with one short burst and goes for the KGBs who appear at the broken window. As they take cover, he quickly confiscates a Kalashnikov from the dead KGB closest to him and makes it to the high wall which encircles the place. \nCarlos climbs over the wall with the Kalashnikov and drops outside the compound to the grass below. \nANGLE ON RAMIREZ IN THE GRASS \nHe sees to his horror that Carlos is getting away. He is ready to scream, going crazy. He has no gun, he wouldn't stand a chance against Carlos, but there is no way he is going to let him get away, no way. He looks around for a rock... anything. \nThere is nothing. Carlos turns his back. Ramirez sees his chance, he gets up on one knee ready to make his move when suddenly he sees two more KGB guys come running around the wall of the compound. \nANGLE ON RAMIREZ \nHe mouths the words: \nRAMIREZ Kill him... Kill him... \nANGLE ON CARLOS \nHe whirls and fires at the two KGBs who fall. \nANGLE ON RAMIREZ \nHe can't believe it. Carlos is getting away? \nANGLE ON CARLOS \nHe suddenly gets a look as if he feels someone's presence. His eyes open wide and he starts to turn when Ramirez comes flying out of the darkness and leaps on Carlos. The two are dressed exactly alike. Carlos is hit from behind and is stunned and drops the assault rifle. \nRamirez has Carlos down and is choking him. Carlos looks up at him more shocked than anything else. Finally Carlos manages to break the grasp and kicks Ramirez off. Now it is a dazzling display of martial arts. Then Ramirez charges Carlos and tackles him and the two go rolling off into the bushes and darkness. When they roll out of the bushes we have no idea which one is which or who we should be rooting for. Just then Jack's Volga drives up at the side. \nANGLE ON THE TWO CARLOSES \nThey roll over onto the bodies of two dead KGB. There is a Kalashnikov on the ground pointed into the Carlos on the bottom's side. The Carlos who is on top manages to get his finger over to the trigger and pulls it sending a burst into the Carlos on the bottom's body. Just then the Carlos on top looks up and sees Jack standing over him with a gun pointed at him ready to shoot. In b.g. we HEAR cars with sirens approaching. The Carlos on top looks over to Jack who is ready to shoot him. \nCARLOS ON TOP Don't shoot. It's me you asshole! \nJack just stares at him and then lowers his gun. \nJACK Let's get the fuck out of here. \nHe turns around and starts to get into the Volga. The Carlos on top, whom we just thought was Ramirez bends down and reaches for the dead KGB's pistol. \nANGLE ON JACK \nHe gets that sixth sense feeling and turns around, his gun raised and pointed at the man whose hand is now on the pistol. Is it Carlos or Ramirez, who is standing there with pistol in hand almost turned to Jack but still at a disadvantage in this Mexican stand off. \nJACK Have you come looking for me now, Annibal? \nTHE MAN WITH THE PISTOL What the fuck are you talking about... \nJACK Awfully warm for this time of year isn't it? \nThe man with the pistol knows this is a password of some kind and the look on his face betrays the fact that he doesn't have an answer. Jack is just about to shoot him when a burst of machine gun fire is heard from the approaching cars and it rips into the tree next to Jack who dives for cover. \nThat act of self-preservation gives the man we now realize is the real Carlos the chance he needs. With catlike grace he dives, rolls and vanishes into the shadows. He has gotten away and Jack has to decide whether to go after his quarry or rescue his friend. He opts for the latter, scoops up Annibal and throws him into the Volga and speeds off as cars approach from the other side. \nEXT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - DAY - ESTABLISHING \nINT. PRIVATE ROOM - BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - DAY \nRamirez is in bed, hooked up to all the monitors and tubes and IVs but he is going to make it. Jack is there with him, having just entered. \nRAMIREZ Any word? \nJACK How you feeling? \nRAMIREZ Did he get away? \nJack nods his head. Ramirez almost breaks down in tears. Jack crosses to him to comfort him. \nRAMIREZ Then it was all for nothing... the whole thing. \nJACK No it wasn't. He's finished. The KGB bought it. As far as they're concerned, he's the enemy now. He'll bounce around from one country to the next. But his paymasters have disowned him. None of their client states will risk using him. No one'll trust him again. He'll spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder waiting to be betrayed. And it'll happen... sooner or later... when it's to some country's advantage... they'll give him up or they'll trade him. He's finished. It worked and he's finished. \nRAMIREZ Not for me he isn't... There are still two of us... \nEXT. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY \nA car pulls up at the hospital and Maura gets out and enters the hospital. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. RAMIREZ'S ROOM - DAY \n"}

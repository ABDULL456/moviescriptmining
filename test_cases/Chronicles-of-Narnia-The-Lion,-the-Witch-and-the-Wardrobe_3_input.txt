LUCY Presents! 
FATHER CHRISTMAS Lucy, Eve's Daughter. These are for you. The juice of the fire flower. If you, or one of your friends are wounded, one drop of this cordial will restore them. And though I do not expect you to use it, this. 
LUCY Well, I think I could be brave enough. 
FATHER CHRISTMAS I'm sure you could. But battles are ugly affairs. Eve's Daughter, Susan. Trust in this bow, for it does not easily miss. 
SUSAN What happened to, 'battles are ugly affairs?' 
FATHER CHRISTMAS And, though you don't seem to have trouble making yourself heard, this. When you put this horn to your lips and blow it, wherever you are, help will come. 
SUSAN Thanks. 
FATHER CHRISTMAS And, Peter. These are tools, not toys. The time to use them may be soon at hand. 
FATHER CHRISTMAS Bare them well! I best be off, winter is almost over and things do pile up when you've been gone a thousand years. Long live Aslan! (he gets in his sleigh and rides off) 
THE CHILDREN Bye... Merry Christmas! 
LUCY Told you he was real! 
PETER Did you hear what he said... winter is almost over. You no what that means... no more ice! 
CROSSING THE RIVER 
SUSAN Wait, maybe we should think about this. 
PETER We don't have time. 
SUSAN I was just trying to be realistic 
PETER No, you're trying to be smart...as usual! 
CROSSING THE ICE 
MR. BEAVER Wait, maybe I should go first. 
PETER Maybe you should.

MOSS Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it. 
WELLS Cast iron? 
MOSS Yes. 
WELLS I don't mean braze. 
MOSS I didn't say braze. 
WELLS Pot metal? 
MOSS What did I say? 
WELLS Were you in Nam? 
MOSS Yeah. I was in Nam. 
WELLS So was I. 
MOSS So what does that make me? Your buddy? Wells sits smiling at him. A beat. 
WELLS Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you. 
MOSS Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in. Wells' smile stays in place. 
WELLS How do you know he's not on his way to Odessa? Moss stares at him. A beat. 
MOSS Why would he go to Odessa? 
WELLS To kill your wife. Another beat. 
MOSS Maybe he should be worried. About me. 
WELLS He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles. Moss doesn't respond. 
WELLS ...You didn't take the product, did you? 
MOSS What product. 
WELLS The heroin. You don't have it. 
MOSS No I don't have it. 
WELLS No. You don't. He rises. 
WELLS ...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells. Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money. 
MOSS If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh? 
WELLS No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me. 
MOSS He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.

Sheriff Bell rises from a booth, taking off his hat. 
BELL Carla Jean, I thank you for comin'. She sits. He sits. 
CARLA JEAN Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is. 
BELL You ain't heard from him?

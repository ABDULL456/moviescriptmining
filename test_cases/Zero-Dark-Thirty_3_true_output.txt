MAYA: Cool! The car navigates the second set of barriers. 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - MAYA'S CUBICLE - SECONDS LATER 
Maya types on her computer: Wassup you talking yet 
EXT. CAMP CHAPMAN - CIA COMPOUND 
Jessica looks up to see the car approaching and puts the phone back in her pocket. The sedan is now 50 yards away. 
SECURTY GUARD Okay, he's coming. We're gonna search him when he gets here. Everyone prepares. The car gets closer and closer, a driver in front and a passenger in back. 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - MAYA'S CUBICLE 
Maya texts again: 
Answer when you can. 
EXT. CAMP CHAPMAN - CIA COMPOUND 
The sedan pulls to a stop. A BLACKWATER GUARD taps on the backseat window. Balawi exits on the passenger side. His free hand is in his pocket. 
BLACKWATER GUARD (to the other guard) Is he supposed to limp like that? 
SECURTY GUARD Take your hand out of your pocket! Hey! 
BALAWI Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar 
BLACKWATER GUARD (raising his M4) Get you hand out of your pocket! 
BALAWI Allahu Akbar. Jessica's smile fades And Balawi detonates a suicide vest hidden under this jacket and the resulting shrapnel storm pulps the crowd, massacring them all - 
CUT TO: 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY ISLAMABAD, CIA SECTION - CONTINUOUS 
Maya looks at her computer screen. She sees her last instant message..And waits for a response. Beat. Maya looks up, concern on her face. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CAMP CHAPMAN - DAY 
The explosion smoke still hovers over Camp Chapman. News reporting of the attack plays over the horrific image. 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - MAYA'S CUBICLE - LATER 
Maya huddles on the floor under the corner of her desk. 
INT. MAYA'S CUBICLE - LATER 
The office has thinned out, and most people have gone home for the day. Maya is crouched in the corner. A wounded animal. Jeremy, the case officer from the conference room, approaches and gives Maya a computer disc. 
JEREMY You okay? No response. 
JEREMY (CONT'D) I didn't think this day could get any worse, but bad news from Saudi intelligence. The courier guy, Abu Ahmed, is dead. It's a detainee video. Maya still fighting to contain her grief, takes the file as an almost welcome distraction. She puts the disc into her computer and hits play. CU COMPUTER SCREEN: A PRISONER being interviewed by a CIA CASE OFFICER holds the photo of Abu Ahmed we've seen so many times. 
PRISONER He's dead, in Afghanistan, 2001. I buried him with my own hands. 
INTERROGATOR Where? 
PRISONER Kabul. Maya stares at the screen. 
MAYA I don't believe this. 
JEREMY Sorry, Maya, I always liked this lead. Jeremy leaves Maya at her computer. She continues to stare at the screen. 
INT. MAYA'S CUBICLE - NIGHT 
Maya is still by herself. Her friend Jack approaches - 
JACK 
(CONSOLING) Hey. Sorry, I just got here. What are you gonna do?

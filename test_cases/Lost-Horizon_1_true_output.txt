The men greet her, all rising. 
BARNARD 
Well, I'm certainly glad to see that it's all finally organized. 
(to servant) 
Okay, handsome. Dish it out, and make it snappy. 
As he sits, he looks over at Gloria and something in her face arrests him. 
BARNARD 
Hey, what's happened to you? 
GLORIA 
(self-consciously) 
Nothing. Why? 
BARNARD 
Why, you look beautiful. 
CONWAY 
That's unkind. Doesn't Miss Stone always look beautiful? 
199. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT TABLE 
Featuring Gloria, Barnard and Conway. 
BARNARD 
(suddenly) 
I got it! It's your make-up. You've got none on. 
Gloria busies herself with her soup, self-consciously. 
BARNARD 
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask. 
LOVETT 
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you. 
BARNARD 
Have I? 
LOVETT 
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once! 
CONWAY 
(lightly) 
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11] 
BARNARD 
(his face has become serious) 
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now. 
(after a pause) 
Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police? 
Lovett is halted in his tracks - soup spoon halfway up to his mouth. 
LOVETT 
Certainly not. 
200. CLOSE SHOT - BARNARD 
BARNARD 
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year. 
LOVETT 
(skeptical) 
The police? 
BARNARD 
Uh-huh. 
(after another pause) 
Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant? 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the others. They look shocked. 
CONWAY 
(the first one to make the connection) 
Chalmers Bryant! 
BARNARD 
Bryant's Utilities - that's me. 
George is the only one unconcerned. He is deeply absorbed in thought - his food has remained untouched. Lovett suddenly explodes. 
LOVETT 
I knew it. I knew I had a reason for hating you! Sir, you're a thief. 
GLORIA 
He never stole anything from you , did he? 
LOVETT 
I have 500 shares of Bryant Utilities that I bought with money that I saved for 20 years teaching school, and now I couldn't sell it for postage stamps. 
201. MED. SHOT - GROUP 
Featuring Barnard. 
BARNARD 
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me! 
LOVETT 
A colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people 
BARNARD 
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed[12] plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had. 
LOVETT 
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back. 
George can't stand it any longer. 
GEORGE 
(suddenly - hoarsely) 
What do you mean - "when we get back"? 
The sharpness of his voice startles the others. 
GEORGE 
What makes you think we're ever going to get back? You may not know it, but you're all prisoners here. We were deliberately kidnapped and brought here - and nobody knows why 
He rises to his feet. 
GEORGE 
Well, I'm not content to be a prisoner. I'm going to find out when we're going to get out of this place.

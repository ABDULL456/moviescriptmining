LUMSDEN -- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that? 
DAVID Not any real sneering as such, no. 
LUMSDEN There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it? 
DAVID Eh -- 
LUMSDEN But they sneer, don't they? 
DAVID I'm not sure -- 
LUMSDEN Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done. 
DAVID Yes, sir. 
LUMSDEN And that's why I think you fit in here. 
DAVID I'm boring? 
LUMSDEN You get the job done. 
DAVID Oh, I see, I thought you meant -- 
LUMSDEN Which is why I'm trusting you with this account. 
Lumsden throws a heavy folder into David's lap.

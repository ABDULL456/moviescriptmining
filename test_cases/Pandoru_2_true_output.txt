BOWER I dunno. It can't be- It just- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) BOWER is quickly growing drowsy, slurring his words as he takes a seat with exhaustion and disbelief. NADIR rests her chin on her knee... eyes growing heavy as LELAND continues telling the tale, softly like a child's bedtime story. LELAND takes a peace of chalk-like material, drawing a new sketch. 
LELAND And now the newest chapter comes to us... three weary travelers, guided by the light. The new brave flyer, woken by the dying machine. He sketches Bower and his journey towards the reactor. 
LELAND (CONT'D) A gallant knight who will wake the fiery beast, light the rockets torch that will sail our mighty ship to port! A new king to deliver us to paradise! Hail to the new King... Hail! LELAND looks to see... everyone is asleep. He adjusts a nozzle that... is pumping a colorless gas out of the vents at the bottom of the tank. With a slow forming grin, he blows out a nearby candle, taking us into... 
FADE THRU BLACK: 
INT. SLEEP CHAMBER/CONTROL DESK - LATER 
PAYTON'S eyes scan across the dim flickering computer screen, a radar scan across a chart of planets... with no Earth shown on the screen. PAYTON is silently in shock as... GALLO watches him closely from across the console. 
PAYTON How could they... how could they have let this happen? PAYTON slides his hands off the keyboard, his finger tips i nearly twitching, an uncontrolled tremble. He tries to hide his hands, sliding them under the console as... GALLO watches him blankly before wandering away to let him sit alone with the horrific realization. PAYTON shakes his head, refusing to accept it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: A low SHUDDER approaches, more powerful then felt before, rattling the pipes as it passes with a FLICKER of LIGHTS as... 
FLICKER DISSOLVE TO: 
DREAM (FLASHBACK) EVALON is smiling towards BOWER as he kneels in front of her, gripping her hands. As he speaks, her smile fades, slowly pulling her hands away and... 
INT. WATER PROCESSOR -- CONT. 
The powerful SHUDDER is felt, amplified in the tank. NADIA shakes awake to see... LELAND is kneeling over her, eyes wide with hunger, deliciously sniffing her body. They both jump with fright and yell in unison. 
NADIA & LELAND 
AAAAAEEIH ! NADIA jumps to her feet, choking and gasping, jabbing her weapon toward LELAND, a small breathing tube clenched in his teeth. BOWER and TANA.KA are woken by their exchange, dazed. 
BOWER What are you doing!? What the- 
NADIA He was- He was gonna fucking eat me! 
LELAND (mouthful of tube) Whaw!? I waddn't- 
NADIA He gassed us! He was gonna- All of us! LELAND is appalled, spitting out the breathing tube. 
LELAND Gas! What gas!? They see he's holding a fork and knife that he quickly tucks behind his back. NP.DIA jabs the weapon and he shrieks. 
LELAND (CONT'D) 
NEVER! THE SHUDDER shakes the tank with more force then ever before as they watch the ceiling. It's followed by two quick SURGES, higher pitch. NADIA looks to BOWER. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NADIA What is that? 
BOWER It's gone... into the final cycle. 
NADIA What does that mean? 
BOWER it means we have less time then I thought. The last phase... before shutdown. It means we're... done. BOWER is oddly defeated, taking a seat, hanging his head. 
NADIA Done!? What do you mean done? What do we do? Hey!? 
BOWER What difference does it make? 
NADIA What are you talking about? You said you could reset the reactor- That we could- That there's a chance to- 
BOWER For what? They're gone. Everything is gone. There's no Earth to go back to, 
THERE'S NO- 
NADIA We weren't meant to go back! We were meant to go on. And now it's more important then ever! We're the last of- 
BOWER And what is left of us? What's left, worth saving? This flight's over. NADIA is angered by his defeat, shoving LELAND aside and squaring off in front of BOWER. 
NADIA What about your duty? What about... your wife!? There's still a chance she's- 
BOWER She's dead.

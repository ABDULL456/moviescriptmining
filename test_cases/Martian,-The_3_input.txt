LEWIS Watney, report -- (NO REPLY) WATNEY, REPORT! 
JOHANSSEN BECK He's offline. I don't know -- Commander, before we lost where he is -- telemetry, his decompression alarm went off -- 
LEWIS JOHANSSEN Shit! Johanssen where did -- He was right in front of you last see him? me and then he was gone. He flew off due west -- 
Lewis surveys the scene. Visibility is NEAR ZERO. She can barely see the people next to her. Tries to keep her heart from POUNDING out of her chest. 
LEWIS (CONT'D) Okay... okay... Martinez, get to the MAV and prep for launch. Everyone else, home in on Johanssen. 
JOHANSSEN (STUMBLING) I can't see anything -- 
VOGEL Doctor Beck! How long can a person survive decompression? 
BECK Less than minute. 
LEWIS Line up and walk west. Small steps. He's probably prone. We don't want to step over him. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
The group fights through the chaos -- 
INT. MAV - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
WHOOSH! Martinez dives into the airlock, forces the door closed. Waits for agonizing seconds as it pressurizes... 
Pressurized. Martinez races up the ladder, slides into the pilot's couch and boots the system. 
MARTINEZ Commander -- The MAV's got an 8 degree tilt. It'll tip at 12.3 -- 
EXT. HAB - STORM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
LEWIS Copy that -- 
Beck checks the readout on his arm computer. 
BECK Johanssen, Watney's bio-monitor sent something before going offline. My computer just says "Bad Packet" -- 
JOHANSSEN It didn't finish transmitting. (works her arm computer) I have the raw packet. It's plaintext: BP 0, PR 0, TP 36.2. 
BECK Copy. (THEN) Blood pressure zero. Pulse rate zero. Temperature normal. 
LEWIS Temperature normal? 
BECK It takes a while for the... it takes a while for the body to cool. 
Everyone stops short as that news lands. 
MARTINEZ (OVER RADIO) Commander. Tilting at 10.5 degrees now, with gusts pushing it to 11. 
LEWIS Copy. If it tips, can you launch before it completely falls over? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTINEZ (OVER RADIO) (HESITATES) Uh. Yes. Ma'am. I could take manual control. 
LEWIS Copy that. Everyone home in on Martinez' suit. That'll get you to the airlock. Get in and prep for launch. 
VOGEL What about you, Commander? 
LEWIS I'm searching a little more. Get moving. And Martinez, if you start to top, launch. 
MARTINEZ (OVER RADIO) You really think I'm leaving you behind? 
LEWIS I just ordered you to. You three, get to the ship. (as they hesitate) GO. 
INT. MAV - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Vogel, Beck, and Johanssen stumble into the airlock. 
EXT. STORM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Lewis can't see a thing in any direction. C'mon, think, Melissa, think... 
She reaches into the pack on her back and removes two of the one meter drill bits she was using earlier to take samples. She holds one in each hand, dragging them on the ground as she trudges through the sand. 
LEWIS Johanssen, would the rover IR camera do any good? 
INT. MAV - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
JOHANSSEN (INTO RADIO) Negative. IR can't get through sand any better than visible light. 
They rip off their helmets. Scramble up the ladder. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BECK What's she thinking? She's a geologist. She knows IR can't get through a sandstorm. 
VOGEL She's grasping. For anything. 
MARTINEZ Commander. We're tilting 11.6 degrees. One good gust and we're tipping. 
LEWIS (OVER RADIO) What about the proximity radar? Could it detect Watney's suit? 
MARTINEZ No way. It's made to see Hermes in orbit, not the metal in a single suit. 
LEWIS (OVER RADIO) Copy. Give it a try.

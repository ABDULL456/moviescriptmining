JOHNNY Hey, Ronnie Renner!  I'm a big fan. 
Ronnie gives a tight nod.  He doesn't like being upstaged by this circus freak. 
The other bikers approach. 
KENNY BARTRAM Heard you like to ride.  Wanna take her for a spin? 
He motions to his BIKE.  Johnny eyes this mean machine. 
RONNIE RENNER Come on, bro.  I'll teach you some tricks...if you can keep up. 
We PUSH IN on Johnny, his ego getting stoked, as we CUT TO -- 
INT. NYC ARENA - TRACK - DAY 
Ronnie jams down the track, kicking dirt back at Johnny. Johnny now wears a MOTOCROSS OUTFIT over his uniform, with the number "004" on the back and a small 4 over his heart. Ronnie hits the first hill, and CATCHES AIR, FLIPPING HIGH! 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER A rock-solid double-flip! 
The CROWD goes wild.  Now it's Johnny's turn.  He hits the hill and pulls the exact same move.  With even more height! 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Look at that lift, ladies and gentlemen! 
Johnny sticks the landing.  The crowd swells.  Ronnie tightens, pulls his throttle harder, taking the next jump, and...MAKING AN INSANE MOVE, CORKSCREWING IN THE AIR! 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Frontside 360!  He's totally flat and whipped! 
He lands clean.  The crowd is ready to explode.  Johnny REVS his engine, his body starting to STEAM, adrenaline burning. He hits the hill, and pulls an even gnarlier SPIN! 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Whoa!  That's a...what is that?  A 
Johnny lands.  The crowd roars.  Ronnie bears down on the last hill.  He leans over his handlebars. 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) He's going for a Kiss of Death! 
Ronnie hits the hill, pulls this JAW-DROPPING DEATH-DEFYING STUNT!  The crowd is deafening!  Ronnie smiles.  And... 
JOHNNY SPEEDS FASTER, FASTER.  Trails of FLAME start to streak off his back!  He RACES LIKE A ROCKET UP THE HILL! LAUNCHING TO IMPOSSIBLE HEIGHTS!  SPINNING LIKE A TOP!  A FLAMING BLUR! 
And now for the really impressive part: Johnny's bike starts to drop, but JOHNNY KEEPS RISING!  He FLAMES ON, spiraling upward!  For a few seconds, he's actually...almost...flying. 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) (hand over mic) Is he......flying? 
A beat.  Time suspended.  And...WHHM!  He PLUMMETS back down! LANDS on his bike in mid-air!  And sticks a perfect landing, maybe even kicking a little dirt up at Ronnie.  Johnny swerves to a stop, with a "holy shit" look on his face.  What the hell just happened?? 
X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! You've just seen the first...the first...TORCHFLIGHT!  The McTORCH! 
A new name is born.  The crowd goes berserk.  Standing ovation.  Riders rush up to Johnny.  Kenny sees his bike: 
THE SEAT MELTED, WHEELS BURNED OFF.  Johnny smiles. 
JOHNNY My bad.  Sorry about that. (a glance to Ronnie) Thanks for the lesson, bro. 
HOT GIRLS swarm.  As Johnny gets swallowed by fans, we see a scary thing flicker in his eyes: the birth of a star. 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - MORNING 
Sue stands alone, sifting through piles of mail.  She focuses on one piece of mail that she's holding.  Her hand begins to disappear and then the envelope slowly begins to disappear as well.  Sue smiles at the success.  Intrigued.  Quiet: 
SUE That's new... 
Reed enters -- overworked, unshaved.  He keeps his head down, preoccupied.  Sue shifts focus. 
SUE (CONT'D) Have you read these...?  From all over.  People want us to fight crimes... save their kids...solve their problems... (no response from Reed) ...when we can't even solve our own. 
She puts the letters down, steps closer to Reed. 
SUE (CONT'D) Reed.  How close are we to a cure? 
REED No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments. 
She considers.  Victor's words echo in her head. 
SUE We're not specimens, we're patients. This isn't just another science project to you, is it...? 
Reed looks up, a little surprised.  He opens his mouth, but -- 
BEN (O.S.) NO...NO...NO FREAKIN' WAY!! 
INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - DAY 
CRASH!  BANG!  Ben stalks around the room, furious.  Reed and Sue rush in. 
REED BEN!  What?  What's going on!? 
Ben points to the wall-sized TV: the ESPN MOTO X GAMES. 
X GAMES REPORTER (ON TV) So what can you tell us about the outfit? 
REVEAL: JOHNNY standing next to an X GAMES REPORTER.  He is peeling off the burned remains of his motocross outfit, revealing his FF UNIFORM, with a "4" STITCHED ONTO THE CHEST. 
Behind them, STEP UP RIDERS launch their MOTO-BIKES off huge 18' high mountains of dirt, thirty feet in the air. 
JOHNNY (ON TV) Not too much, but I will say that it's all weather and no leather.  Kind of Armani meets Astronaut.

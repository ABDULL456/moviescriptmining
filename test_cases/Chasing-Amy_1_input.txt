ALYSSA Aren't there some men that you find attractive?  Granted, not enough to sleep with, but still - just handsome or something! 
HOLDEN Sure.  Harrison Ford.  And our mail- man. 
ALYSSA Well it's the same thing.  I look at you and just find you really handsome. And you know, it has very little to do with your look, per-se.  Your look is fine, don't get me wrong.  But it's more your outlook.  The things you say, the way you see things.  It's... I don't know... attractive, 
Holden looks away, embarrassed, 
ALYSSA I weirded you our the other night 
HOLDEN Huh!  No, not really. 
ALYSSA Come on. 
HOLDEN (beat) It's just that we've.., I mean, I've never seen that kind of thing up close and personal.  It just took awhile to process, longer than usual. 
ALYSSA Do you want to talk about it! 
HOLDEN Um.  If you want to. 
ALYSSA I like you.  I haven't liked a man in a long time.  And I'm not a man-hater or something.  It's just been some time since I've been exposed to a man that didn't immediately live-into a stereotype of some sort.  And I want you to feel comfortable with me, because I want us to be friends.  So if there are things you'd like to know, it's okay to ask me. 
HOLDEN (beat) Why girls? 
ALYSSA (beat) Why men? 
HOLDEN Because that's the standard 
ALYSSA If that's the only reason you're attracted to women - because it's the standard.. 
HOLDEN It's more than that. 
ALYSSA So you've never been curious about men? 
HOLDEN Curious about men?  Well... I always wondered why my father watched 'Hee- Haw'. 
ALYSSA You know what I mean. 
HOLDEN No. 
ALYSSA Why not! 
HOLDEN No interest. 
ALYSSA Because...? 
HOLDEN Girls feel right. 
ALYSSA And that's how I feel.  I've never really been attracted to men.  I'm more comfortable with the idea of girls. 
HOLDEN Wait, wait, wait - you're still a virgin? 
ALYSSA No. 
HOLDEN But you've only been with girls. 
ALYSSA You're saying a person's a virgin until they've had intercourse with a member of the opposite sex? 
HOLDEN Isn't that the standard definition?

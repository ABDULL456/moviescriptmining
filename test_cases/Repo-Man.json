{"train": "REPO MAN \nWritten by \nAlex Cox \nTranscript by \nSteve Farmer \nRepo Man theme music now begins playing. Map is shown in background (green text on black background), zoomed in on Los Alamos, New Mexico. While remaining credits are shown, the map travels to Sante Fe, then Albuquerque, then begins following US66 west through Arizona to California, finally ending up a few miles east of Goffs (northwest of Needles). \nGreen '64 Chevy Malibu \nMalibu is weaving down the highway in the desert, passes billboard with motorcycle cop behind it. Cop pulls out behind Malibu. \nJ. FRANK PARNELL Forty-niner and his daughter Clementine. Oh my darlin, oh my darlin... \nMotorcycle cop pulls the car over, gets off motorcycle and raps on car window. \nJ. FRANK PARNELL Clementine Clemen- \nCOUNTY SHERIFF Let me see your drivers license. \nRADIO Post ten-eighteen. Post ten-eighteen. \nCOUNTY SHERIFF From out of town, hmm? What's you got in the trunk? \nJ. FRANK PARNELL oah...you don't want to look in there. \nCOUNTY SHERIFF Give me the keys. \nThe motorcycle cop walks around to the back of the car and opens the trunk. The car has New Mexico license plates KBB-283. In every scene after this when the plates are visible, they will be 127-GBH. \nCOUNTY SHERIFF AHHHHHH! \nThe motorcycle cop gets disintegrated, leaving behind a pair of flaming boots (a reference to the movie Timerider, which was co-written and produced by Mike Nesmith). Parnell watches from side mirror, where we see that the left side of his sunglasses have no lens. \nJ. FRANK PARNELL Oh my darlin Clementine, you are lost now gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine. \nOtto and Kevin, in the supermarket, facing cans of generic yellow cling sliced peaches. \nKEVIN Do Do Do De Do De Do De Do De Do Feeling Do De Da Do De Do De Do Feeling seven-up. I'm feeling seven-up. Feeling seven up. I'm feeling seven up. It's a crisp refreshing feeling crystal clear and light. America's drinking seven-up and it sure feels right. Feeling lucky seven. \nOtto puts price sticker on Kevin's glasses. \nOTTO Kevin stop singing man. \nDebbi pulls back his shirt a little and begins kissing his stomach, then stops. \nDEBBI Otto. Otto. \nOTTO What? \nDEBBI Get me another beer. \nOtto goes downstairs and there's a party going on. Institutionalized plays in background. \nKEVIN Ow. Cool. Ow. Dammit. I'm supposed to be the host here. \nKEVIN Ow! \nOtto returns to the bedroom \nOTTO Debbi honey. I got you a beer. \nOtto turns on light and finds Duke there with Debbi. \n[OTTO Shit. \nDEBBI Just ignore him Duke he's nothing but a big baby. \nDUKE Turn the fucking light out.] \nOtto leaves room just as Kevin arrives and looks in the door. \nKEVIN What are you doing? Nobody supposed to be up here. This is my parent's room. \nDude, nobody supposed to be up here, this is my parent's room.) \n[Otto in a vacant lot drinking a beer. \nIt's early morning and Otto starts walking. \nOTTO Don't want to talk about anything else. We don't want to know. We're just dedicated...to our favorite shows. Saturday night live, Monday night football, Dallas, Jeffersons, Gilligan's island, Flintstones. ] \nOtto still walking, but it's light now. \nBud pulls up next to him in a blue sedan. \nBUD Hey kid! (Honk) Hey! Hey kid! Hey! Hey! Are you hard of hearing? \nOTTO What do you want? \nBUD You want to make ten bucks? \nREPO VICTIM'S GIRL Shut up rent-a-cop. \nOLY Best goddamn (gol-durn) car on the lot. \nREPO VICTIM You damn right it is. \nMARLENE Will you, Will you hold please? \nMARLENE Helping hand acceptance corporation Marlene speaking. \nREPO VICTIM Say moma what's happening? You want to take a lift? \nMARLENE No thank you. L.A.P.D. I wanted to report a repo in Boro heights area. \nREPO VICTIM'S GIRL Let's go. \nThe Repo victim and his girl leave \nPLETTSCHNER A Cadillac. Is he a pimp? \nBUD Shut up Plettschner. \nMARLENE Bud what street was that car on? \nBUD Honey I don't know, some alley uh. Hey kid! \nOTTO What? \nBUD Hey what street was the Cutlass on? \nOTTO I don't know. What happened to your old lady? \nMARLENE They don't know I'll call you back. \nMARLENE Helping hand acceptance corporation Marlene speaking. \nBUD My old lady? Oh shit (shoot)! I forgot all about her. Well she'll take the bus. She's a rock. \nMARLENE What kind of car? What kind of car? \nBUD Hey come on in. Marlene! Marlene! \nMARLENE Can you hold? \nOLY Got a name kid? \nOTTO Yeah! It's Otto. \nOtto out in the yard with Miller \nMILLER You find one in every car. You'll see. \nBack in the desert \nWe begin scene looking through the windshield of a police motorcycle. The windshield of the police motorcycle naturally has a pine tree air freshener hanging from it. We see some people searching around in the desert, most of them in radiation suits, with a local sheriff following a woman in a business suit. \nRADIO Come in Officer Labeef do you read me? \nRADIO Chuck will you stop fooling around? \nSHERIFF I've never seen the like of that. \nRADIO I have the stats on that car Officer Labeef. \nRADIO Ten-forty Baker \nSHERIFF What could have done that to him? Gasoline? Napalm? \nAGENT ROGERSZ It happens sometimes. People just explode. Natural causes. \nSHERIFF What? \nSuspect presence on west coast confirmed \n44% possibility Los Angeles \nLocate immediately \nDo not notify police \nAGENT ROGERSZ Suspect presence on west coast confirmed. Do not notify police. \nOtto and Kevin on a porch in the rain \nOTTO Night watchman in Pomona. \nKEVIN Yep. \nOTTO Asbestos worker. City of industry. \nKEVIN Yep Yep! \nOTTO French fry maker Agoura. Ha Ha that's absurd. \nKEVIN Yeah? Well you think it's funny huh? There's fucking (lots of) room to move as a fry cook, man. You know I could be manager in two years? King! God! (egad!) \nJazz music plays on the radio. In almost all scenes inside of Bud's car, Jazz music will be playing on the radio. \nIn this sequence the background changes from day to night, back to day, and back to night again (during the speed snorting scene) even though the dialog seems continuous. I believe that this was done intentionally to show the passage of time, but the disjointed events are cut so smoothly as to make it seem like they goofed the continuity. It's clearer in the TV version where there truly is a break between the line about speed and the actual snorting. \nOTTO So how much do I get paid, twenty-five buck a car. \nBUD Paid? You don't get paid. Are you kidding, you work on commission, that's better than getting paid. \nBUD Most cars you rip are worth two or three hundred dollars. Fifty thousand dollar Porsche (german pronounciation) might make ya five grand. \nBUD It helps if you dress like a detective, too. Detectives dress kind of square. People think this guy is a cop. They're going to think you're packing something. They don't fuck (mess) with you so much. \nOTTO Are you? \nBUD Am I what? \nOTTO Packin' something. \nBUD Ha. Only an asshole (a jackass) gets killed for a car. Guys who make it are the guys who get into their cars at anytime. Get in at three A.M. get up at four. That's why there ain't a repo man I know that don't take speed. \nOTTO Speed huh? \nBud at payphone \nBud is talking on phone. \nBUD I'll call you back! (hangs up) Flippin general telephone. \nBud picks up phone and dials. Phone begins making a loud whining noise. \nBud gets sledgehammer from car and destroys phone while Otto watches. When Bud is done, Otto gets crowbar from car and beats side of phone with it while laughing. \nBUD C'mon. \nOtto and Bud in car in alley \n(In the television version, this entire scene takes place while watching Bud's car drive down a road, but you can still hear the snorting in the background.) \n[BUD SNORTING A LINE Jesus Christ.] \nBUD Never broke into a car. Never hot-wired a car. Kid. I never broke into a trunk. I shall not cause harm to any vehicle nor the personal contents thereof. Nor through inaction let that vehicle or the personal contents thereof come to harm. That's what I call the repo code kid. Don't forget it etch it in your brain. Not many people got a code to live by anymore. \nBUD Hey! Hey look at that. Look at those assholes (that) over there. \nWe see a group of people around a tow truck with a car being hooked up to it. \nBUD Ordinary  people I hate 'em. \nOTTO HAHAHAH \nLEILA Laugh away fuckface (fatface) that picture is going to be on the cover of ever major newspaper in two days time. \nOTTO How do you know that? \nLEILA Part of a secret network. A scientist who is also in our secret sect smuggled the corpses off of this air force base. Now he's got them in the truck of his car. It's a Chevy Malibu. We've got to find him. \nOTTO What are you going to do with them, put them on Johnny Carson? \nLEILA Yes! We're going to have a press conference and tell the world. \nRADIO Ehw. What's that? I don't know dear. But it is alive. It seems friendly though. Aw look it's curled up. How cute oh no. Maybe we can take it home it doesn't seem to have any. Oh yes let's. But no! No matter how appealing do not let strange creature in you house. We all know strange creatures are on the increase. Many of them do seem furry and adorable, but beware we don't know from whence they came. Be safe. Be safe. Report strange incidences today. (continues in background) \nThey pull up in front of a building \nOTTO United fruitcake outlet. \nLEILA My door doesn't open. \nOtto lets Leila out \nLEILA Thanks for the ride. \nAs Leila stands there, we notice she has a yellow happy face pin on her dress. \nOTTO Sure Ummm I don't know. what do you think? Ah want to go out with me again sometime? \nLEILA I don't know. I'm going to be kind of busy with work, the Malibu and everything. \nOTTO Hey great. Terrific. Here's your shit (stuff). \nLEILA What's your problem? I mean girls might like you if you lightened up a little bit. \nOTTO Fuck (Flip me). Girls pay to go out with me. All right? \nLEILA You wanna get back in the car? \nOTTO What, here? \nLEILA Yeah. \nSqueals are heard from the back seat of the car \nBack at the Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation \nOLY Twenty thousand dollars for a Chevy Malibu? \nOtto sees boxes wrapped in ribbons in back seat and hands one to Lite who throws it out window. A car runs over box and we see that it is full of money. Otto continues throwing boxes out of the window. \nLITE You read that book I gave you? \nOTTO What book? \nLITE Dioretix. Science of matter over mind. \nOTTO Unh uhg \nLITE You'd better read it and quick. That book will change your life. Found it in a Maseratti in Beverly hills. \nOtto and Miller in vacant lot under bridge \nMILLER A lot of people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidences and things. They don't realize that there's this like lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything. I'll Give you an example, show you what I mean. Suppose you thinking about a plate of shrimp. Suddenly somebody will say like plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp out of the blue no explanation. No point in looking for one either. It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness. \nOTTO You eat a lot of acid Miller, back in the hippie days? \nMILLER I'll give you another instance. You know the way everybody's into weirdness right now. Books in all the supermarkets about Bermuda triangles, UFO's, how the Mayans invented television. That kind of thing. \nOTTO I don't read them books. \nMILLER Well the way I see it it's exactly the same. There ain't no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine. People get so hung up on specifics. They miss out on seeing the whole thing. Take South America for example. In South America thousands of people go missing every year. Nobody knows where they go. They just like disappear. But if you think about it for a minute, you realize something. There had to be a time when there was no people. Right? \nOTTO Yeah. I guess. \nMILLER Well where did all these people come from? hmmm? I'll tell you where. The future. Where did all these people disappear to? hmmm? \nOTTO The past? \nMILLER That's right and how did they get there? \nOTTO How the fuck (hell) do I know? \nMILLER Flying saucers. Which are really? Yeah you got it. Time machines. I think a lot about this kind of stuff. I do my best thinking on the bus. That how come I don't drive, see? \nOTTO You don't even know how to drive. \nMILLER I don't want to know how. I don't want to learn. See? The more you drive, the less intelligent you are. \nIn Bud's car driving through a tunnel \nBUD You know I think I saw one of those things once. One of those UFOs. I mean it was really it was kind of kind of scary. I saw all these colored lights and, uh, sounds. I mean sounds and lights like I never heard before. I mean it was really weird. \nOTTO Bud. \nBUD Yeah? \nOTTO Hey Leila! All right, um, this is Otto. The guy who gave you a ride and stuff. I heard something about that car. \nLeila and Otto at the United Fruitcake Outlet \nLeila takes Otto into a cinderblock room which has a neon sculpture on the wall and in the center of the room, standing on a pedestal, is a humorous statue of what could be a humanoid type alien. \nLEILA Otto. Otto stop. You said you had something to tell me. \nLEILA Otto? Otto! \nOTTO Huh? \nLEILA What did you want to tell me? \nOTTO Oh! Take off your clothes. \nLEILA I'm at work, Otto! \nOTTO Oh yeah? Me too. \nLEILA Your work is different than mine. \nOTTO Says who? \nOtto takes down his pants (according to the filmmakers, Estevez enjoyed doing this on a regular basis. Maybe they were just joking?). \nLEILA What are you doing.? Don't do that. \n[OTTO Well the least you could do is give me a blow job. \nLeila slaps Otto \nOTTO Heh, I guess that means no.] \nDEADRA Leila? We have a cell meeting in two minutes time. \nLEILA Thanks Deadra. I'll be right there. \nBud and Lite parked in their cars side by side \nBUD See that motherfucker (melonfarmer) only thinks I don't know what's going on, Lite. As soon as I find that Chevy I'm going indy. I'm going to buy myself a tow truck, a couple of pitbulls, and run a yard. Sit around and watch everybody else do the work for a while (change). \nLite lights up a roach. \nLITE No way you can do that on twenty grand man. \nBUD The hell I can as long as you have good credit and my credit is spotless. \nKEVIN Sure thing. \nNAPOLEON Hey thanks a lot buddy. \nKEVIN Any thing for you babes. \nNAPOLEON All right, you're beautiful. I love you. \nKEVIN I'll be right back. \nLagarto gets in the Malibu and both cars drive off. Kevin returns from inside and sees both cars gone. Two other attendants sit at a table and also look; the attendant on the right is director Alex Cox. \nKEVIN What?? \nShot of car driving down freeway, passed by several motorcycles. \nOtto and Mrs. Parks in Mrs. Parks' living room \nOTTO It's really very simple Mrs. Parks. You don't want me to take your car and I don't want to take your car. Now I said to the boss I said ah Look! I do not want to repossess this lady\u0092s car. \nSound of motorcycles pulling up outside of house. \nMRS. PARKS Well I've been in the hospital you see. \nOTTO Yeah, Yes I understand. My job is really on the line over this one. I could lose it right away. \nMRS. PARKS I'll see if I can borrow some money from somewhere. \nOTTO That's terrific. Really terrific. \nMrs. Park's son and his fellow band members enter \nMRS. PARKS Oh how was the rehearsal son? \nMRS. PARKS' SON It was O.K. Who's this? \nMRS. PARKS Oh this is Mr. Otto. He's from the finance company. He's been telling me that he isn't going to take the car this time, even though he could. \nOTTO Well, uh, gotta get going here. \nOtto fumbles nervously with his briefcase trying to close it. \nMRS. PARKS Did you like the tea? \nOTTO The tea? \nMRS. PARKS Uh huh? \nPLETTSCHNER Don't you ever tell me to shut up. \nLagarto and Napoleon in the Malibu \nThey pull up in front of a diner. \nNAPOLEON Shit (shoot)! (?)! It's too hot in here man. What the hell's going on? So fucking (flippin) hot I think that shit in the trunk is going to melt. I think we better take a look, all right? \nLAGARTO Go get us two sodas. \nNAPOLEON All right, as soon as I check the trunk. \nLAGARTO We're just the mules, comprende? (Andale')... \nLagarto calls Marlene from phone booth. A sign in the window of the diner behind him says \"2.95 Plate O-Shrimp Luncheon Special\". \nMARLENE Helping hand. \nLAGARTO Marlene! We've found the car. \nArchie, Duke, and Debbie exit a window and go down a fire escape [dropping armloads of pills as they go]. Behind them, a sign says \"Fox & Mac Taggert Pharmaceutical Company\". \nDUKE Come on you guys! \nDUKE Get the lead out. \nDEBBI Stop pushing Duke. \n[ARCHIE My medication. Aw man! \nDUKE Aw be cool dude we got more. \nARCHIE Come on. Come on. da-dee-dee-dee-dah-dah dee-dee... (continues to the tune of The Ride of the Valkyries) \nLagarto on the phone with Marlene \nLAGARTO Yeah well that's not the only thing Marlene. This car is hot. \nMARLENE What do you mean? Stolen? \nLAGARTO No. No I mean it's hot really hot. \nMARLENE Hot? \nLAGARTO Yeah, we're sweating like pigs man. \nMARLENE I got the papers. Where is the car from? \nLeila and J. Frank Parnell on pay phones \nLeila on phone hears garbled sounds on receiver. \nLEILA Hello. Is it you? This is Leila. Are you using a scrambler? \nJ. FRANK PARNELL I can't hear you. I'm using the scrambler. \nLEILA (garbled noises in background) Look out! \nJ. FRANK PARNELL What? \nA car swerves into the phone booth, then crosses street and hits a fire hydrant. The agents are trapped inside by the airbags. More agents appear and chase Leila \nAGENT Happy face! You want a ride? \nIn Agent Rogersz van \nAn agent types while eating potato chips. The camera pans across the van to Agents Rogersz, who is watching a monitor which shows Leila being questioned \nLEILA What do you want from me? \nAGENT We ask the questions. \nLEILA You're not going to torture me are you? \nLEILA Torture you? What for? \nLEILA To find out what I know. I'd torture someone in a second if it was up to me. \nAGENT Huh? Why are you looking for the Malibu? \nLEILA Because of the trunk. The aliens inside. \nAGENT Illegal aliens? \nLEILA No, Silly, Extraterrestrials. \nAGENT Ahhh, heh. Did you ever think about joining the CIA? \nLEILA Um. I going to have to ask my boyfriend. \nAGENT Boyfriend?? \nRogersz computer screen prints up the following information \nSUBJECT Otto Maddox \n[MILLER John Wayne was a fag.] \nEVERYONE The hell he was. \nMILLER He was too you boys. I installed two way mirrors in his pad in Brentwood. And he'd come to the door in a dress. \nPLETTSCHNER Ah, you're fucking (flippin) nuts. \nOLY That doesn't mean he was a homo (freak), Miller. Lotta straight guys like to watch their buddies fuck (play). I know I do. \nBUD They do? \nPLETTSCHNER Yeah. \nOLY Don't you? \nPLETTSCHNER Damn straight I do. \nLITE Fuck (Damn) John Wayne man. Tell us his name you little pussy (sissy). \nOTTO Kiss off you asshole (airhead). \nOTTO Ow you bastards (loonies)! \nBUD Hey take it easy. Take it easy. The guys head is hurt. \nOLY This is too personal sonny. The thing is a repo man got beat up in the line of duty. Now it doesn't matter that that man was you. What really matters is that the guy that did it has got to pay the price. Now stop being selfish and tell us his name. \nLITE Come on. \nOTTO Ahh Oww You bastard (buzzard). \nOTTO All right! All right! All right! All right! O.K. his name was... \nThe repo men in the front of Mr. Humphries's house \nThey ring the bell and Mr. Humphries opens the door. In the background, we can just barely see Kevin, who appears to be in his pajamas. This is never explained in the movie. \nOLY Mr. Humphries? \nMR. HUMPHRIES Yes? Yes I'm Mr. Humphries. What do you want? Ungghhh... \nRepo Men beat up Mr. Humphries. \nAt the Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation office \nT.V. The president admitted that U.S. war planes have napalmed refugees camps in Southern Mexico. He explained that these camps were in fact guerrilla bases. In strife torn Guatemala shots were fires at the U.S. embassy and government troops retaliated killing 50... (continues in background) \nARCHIE Oh Chante.] \nDUKE Fuck (flip) this let's go do some crimes. \n[ARCHIE Adios butthole.] \nLEILA Charming friends you got there Otto. \nOTTO Thanks, I made'um myself. \nDebbi, Archie and Duke leave to find J. Frank Parnell breaking into the Malibu \nDEBBI Hey what  you doing with our car? \nJ. FRANK PARNELL Your car? \nARCHIE Yeah! \nJ. FRANK PARNELL Are you sure? This looks like my car. Are there pecan pies in the back seat? \nARCHIE Not any more. We ate 'em. \nDUKE Shut up Archie. \nARCHIE You shut up. \nDUKE You're still here? \nJ. FRANK PARNELL My car looks just like this. But this is yours, your car? \nARCHIE Yeah four eyes. \nJ. FRANK PARNELL Of course...what's in the trunk? \nDUKE What do you mean? \nJ. FRANK PARNELL You don't even know what's in your own trunk. \nDEBBI Kill him Duke! \nJ. FRANK PARNELL You know what? I think you're afraid to find out. \nDEBBI Kill him. \nARCHIE Come on Duke you putty butt, kill him. \nDUKE I aint afraid of nothing see. \nBUD . Makes you wonder how much they owe. Most of them are on the run. Don't even use their fucking (flippin) social security numbers. If there was just some way to find out how much the motherfuckers (melonfarmers) owe and making them pay. \nOTTO Jesus Christ (Holy cow) bud. They're winos, they don't have any money. You think they'd be bums if they did? \nBUD You want out? Do ya? \nOTTO No! \nBUD What's a matter with you? Don't you like your job anymore? Not too happy in your job? I mean I feel like were not communicating any more. When we first started out I though I could teach you something share something with you for Christ's sake. Answer me! \nOtto gets out and walks down street. Passes agents picking up dead body. \nAGENT (heard in background) I'm picking up the dead. I'm putting my hands around this dead body. I'm, I'm carrying his limp torso to the truck. And he feels like like he has only been dead a little while but... \nOtto sees the Malibu and gives chase. Losing the car, he stops on a bridge to puke. When done, he sees the Malibu emerge from under the bridge. He runs down the stairs and after the Malibu as it goes through a railroad crossing which has red lights blinking and bell ringing. J. Frank Parnell stops and lets him in. \nJ. FRANK PARNELL (holds out hand) J. Frank Parnell. \nOTTO ott, ott... \nJ. FRANK PARNELL What line of work you in? \nOTTO re, re, re.. \nJ. FRANK PARNELL Rock'n'roller, eh!? I used to be a musician myself, college days. Of course it was folk songs and protest songs back then. (begins singing, badly) We shall overcome, we shall overcome... \nOtto coughs. \nJ. FRANK PARNELL (stops singing and scratches ear) Did you ever feel as if your mind had started to erode? \nOTTO No. \nJ. FRANK PARNELL Ever been to Utah? \nOTTO Nuh-uh \nJ. FRANK PARNELL I go to Utah every year. Friend of mine, was a designer of the MX missile race track basing mode. A hundred thousand miles of railroad track on a big loop through Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Bombs were going to hide in locomotive sheds. That way the red team would never know exactly where they were. I still go out to Utah, just to think about the way things might have been. \nOTTO Sir. I represent the Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation. \nJ. FRANK PARNELL Radiation, yes indeed! You hear the most outrageous lies about it. Half-baked goggle-boxed do-gooders telling everybody it\u0092s bad for you. Pernicious nonsense! Everybody could stand a hundred chest X-rays a year. They ought to have 'em too. When they canceled the project it almost did me in. One day my mind was literally a-burst. The next day nothing. Swept away... But I showed them. I had a lobotomy in the end. \nOTTO Lobotomy? Isn't that for loonies? \nJ. FRANK PARNELL Not at all. A friend of mine had one. Designer of the neutron bomb. Ever hear of the neutron bomb? Destroys people. Leaves buildings standing. It fits in a suit case. It's so small no one knows it's there until blammo. Eyes melt skin explodes everybody dead. It's so immoral working on the thing can drive you mad. That's what happened to this friend of mine. So he had a lobotomy. Now he's well again. \nOTTO What kind of car does your... does your friend drive? \nOTTO Not yet. Oly's going to get it for me though. I just signed the papers. \nBUD Whu, what do you mean, what papers? \nOTTO Beats me, just some, uh, contract or something. \nBUD Didn't you read it? \nOTTO Well, no, just, uh, standard practice, uh, contract... \nBUD Melonfarmer Oly! ...oooh, shoot. \nOTTO What, is that not a happening deal? \nBud breaks into the lot. Later, he picks up Otto \nBUD Hey ace. Wait up. \nOTTO So you want to talk about it? \nBUD Talk about what kid? \nOTTO Why you're so damn mad at me? \nBUD I'm not mad at you.  damn. I'm not. I'm not mad at you. \nOTTO All right O.K. \nDuke and Debbie in car in front of a liquor store \n[DUKE Debbie? \nDEBBIE What? \nDUKE I've been thinking. Now that we've got some money and Archie's gone, don't you think it's time we we settle down? Get a little house. I want you to have my baby. \nDEBBIE Why? \nDUKE Well I don't know. Every body does it. And it just seems like the thing to do and... \nDEBBI Asshole.] \nDUKE Let's go do the job. \nBud and Otto are at the counter. Duke and Debbi enter waving guns. \nOTTO Duke! Debbie! What what are you guys doing here? \nAGENT Man. \nAGENT ROGERSZ Don't touch the body, don't touch the body. \nAGENT Sorry. \nAGENT Telephone call for you agent. \nAGENT ROGERSZ Don't bother me now. \nAGENT But Agent Rogersz, it's the Gipper. \nAGENT Look. \nAGENT Booth's setting him on fire \nOtto enters Parents living room \nParents are covered with cobwebs and watching TV. \nREVEREND LARRY ON TV ...fail to register for patriotic chores. So, please call this toll free number. Praise the lord. There is no redemption for the unredeemed, no escape for the fair weather patriots. No salvation from the boiling blistering fires of eternal damnation. Now these are the end times. Because in these days there shall be hell in time. Man shall be lovers of their own self rather than lovers of God. \nOTTO'S DAD Haven't seen you in a while, Son. \nTV No escape... \nOTTO'S MOM Some men were just here looking for you, Otto. \nTV No salvation from the blistering files of eternal damnation. For in these days there shall be hell in time, there shall be war and more war, and earthquakes in diverse places... \nOTTO What kind of men? \nOTTO'S MOM Very nice young men. They wore sunglasses. \nOTTO Well, what did you tell them? Did you tell them I was sick? \nOTTO'S DAD We told them the truth, son. Gave them your address at work. \nTV Money shall run out and the people will line up at the banks and there won't be anything . . . these prophecies are in your bible. The same one that you have in your home. Now I want you to get up off of your sofa and put that beer down and go wherever it is in your house pick up that book and turn with me... \nOtto turns off TV and leaves. \nOtto returns to the Helping Hand Yard and sees an argument going on in the office \nAGENT Where's the car baby? That Chevy Malibu baby. Where's the car? \nPLETTSCHNER Otto! \nOTTO Hey Fletch. Coffee break. \nOtto throws a pot of coffee into Plettschner's face. Marlene steps through door. Otto steps outside and is immediately captured by agents. \nAgent Rogersz and Leila watch Otto on monitor \nAGENT ROGERSZ Good evening Otto. This is agent Rogersz. I'm going to ask you a few questions. And since time is short and you may lie, I'm going to have to torture you. But I want you to know it isn't personal. \nOTTO Look Ah this isn't really necessary. I'll tell you anything you want to know. \nAGENT ROGERSZ Good! Where is the Malibu? \nOTTO I don't know. Somebody ripped it from the yard. \nOtto his hit with electric shock and screams. \nLEILA I don't think he knows. \nAGENT ROGERSZ Increase the voltage. \nLEILA But what if he's innocent? \nAGENT ROGERSZ No one is innocent.

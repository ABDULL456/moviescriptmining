STORMIE So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy Osbourne song backwards or something? 
ERWIN I'm afraid it's not that simple... 
STORMIE I thought you said you knew how to bring him back to life? 
ERWIN I do! But when I was putting him back together, I noticed something was missing. 
Stormie thinks about this for a second, then: 
STORMIE Awwww, he won't be needing that... I mean, what girl would let him put his rotten ol'... 
ERWIN (cuts her off) No-no! Not that! It's his heart... it's missing. 
STORMIE Well... does it really matter? Can't you use an aquarium pump or something? 
ERWIN No... he has to have a heart. A human heart. A good one. 
Meagan speaks for the first time: 
MEAGAN I know where we can get a heart... A good one. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
A sign reads: CITY MORGUE.  Through the front window a GUARD can be seen sitting at the reception desk. Erwin, Stormie, and Meagan watch him from the pick-up, parked a safe distance away. 
ERWIN That guard in there might pose a problem. 
MEAGAN Do you think you and Stormie could keep him occupied for a few minutes? 
Erwin and Stormie exchange looks, then shrug -- why not? 
MEAGAN (continuing) Okay... let's do it. 
A few moments later, the guard looks up as the pick- up swerves wildly into the parking lot.  He gets up and goes to the glass door, peering out. 
ANGLE THROUGH GLASS DOOR as Stormie and Erwin start making out -- hot and heavy. 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
Meagan BREAKS a small window near the ceiling. She crawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops to the floor.  She shines her flashlight around the dark laboratory, illuminating anatomy charts, jars full of organs, etc. 
Crossing to the lockers, Meagan tentatively opens one of the drawers and shines her light inside -- ug!  Wrong guy.  She opens the next drawer -- ick! Even worse. 
Meagan opens a third drawer -- Jesse.  Her lip starts to quiver as she caresses his face. 
EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME 
At the glass door, the guard is watching the action in the parking lot, his breath fogging the window. He wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a better look. 
Inside the truck, Stormie and Erwin wrestle around. 
STORMIE Hey! Watch that! 
ERWIN I'm just trying to make it look real. 
STORMIE Just keep your hands above the bra, pizza face. 
The windows are starting to steam up. 
INT. MORGUE - SAME TIME 
Meagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber gloves.  Then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru- ments (saws, rib cutters, etc.) and selects a large knife. 
Meagan stands over Jesse's body.  She pulls back the sheet, exposing his chest.  Meagan raises the knife far above her head. 
MEAGAN Forgive me, Jesse... 
Meagan plunges the knife into Jesse's chest with a sickening THWACK! 
EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME 
The windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged, obscuring the guard's view.  He licks his lips, deciding to investigate closer.  The guard unlocks the front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin. They spot him coming and break their embrace.  In another moment, the pick-up is PEELING out of the parking lot.  The guard watches the truck go, shakes his head, and goes back inside to start his rounds. 
Up the street, parked with the lights off in the night shade of a large tree, Stormie and Erwin watch as the guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards the morgue.

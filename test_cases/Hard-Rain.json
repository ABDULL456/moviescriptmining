{"train": "\"HARD RAIN\" \nScreenplay by \nGraham Yost \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN \nRAIN \nFalls from low grey clouds. Down below we see... \nTHE RIVER \nMuddy, slow and powerful, overflowing its banks. In the near distance is... \nTHE RESERVOIR \nFilled to the maximum, water thundering out of two open gates. We close in on... \nTHE DAM \nThere's a Dam Control Office in the middle of the dam. We MOVE OFF the reservoir and head out over... \nTHE TOWN OF HUNTINGBURG \nWe see \"NO FEAR\" spelled out in stones on one man's roof. We go down and into... \nEXT. STREETS OF HUNTINGBURG - DUSK \nStorefronts are sandbagged and closed. A sign on one store reads: GONE FISHING. A sign on another: HEY LOOTER. NOTHING OF VALUE HERE. TRY NEXT DOOR. And on the next store: HE'S LYING. \nA CHURCH \nBeautiful, old, ringed with a five-foot-high wall of sandbags. The floodwater is up to the first level of sandbags. \nCARS AND PICKUP TRUCKS \nLoaded down, are heading out of town on streets covered in the first water of the flood. \nA STATUE \nOn an island in the middle of the street. It's Civil War- era, of a general on a horse, sword held high. The floodwater is over the curb, lapping at the base of statue's pedestal. Near the statue stands... \nTHE SHERIFF \n50s, with soft edges and friendly eyes. He's talking into his radio mike. \nSHERIFF So, are we all going to die? \nEXT. RESERVOIR DAM \nHANK, the dam control officer, is on the radio with the Sheriff. \nHANK Not right now. But I'm gonna have to let out a little more. \nEXT. MAIN STREET \nWAYNE and PHIL, two deputies, 30s, are near the Sheriff, shoring up a sandbag wall that has partially collapsed. \nPHIL I think my best was when I turned twelve. My Dad set up a treasure hunt. It was really cool. (off Wayne's disdainful look) Well, it was. \nWayne shrugs a \"whatever\" and pulls a sandbag up out of the water. There's unpleasant-looking muck all over his arms. He drops the sandbag back into the water and shakes off the crud with disgust. \nWAYNE This blows. \nPHIL My most awful birthday was sweet sixteen. I had mono. How about you? What was your worst? \nWAYNE You kidding? You think I could've possibly had a birthday worse than this? What kind of loser do you think I am? \nSHERIFF (O.S.) Don't answer that, Phil. \nThe Sheriff walks over. \nSHERIFF Hank says he's gonna open another gate. We're gonna get another rise. \nThey turn at the sound of honking. The MAYOR drives up. \nMAYOR Gentlemen. Hey -- happy birthday, Wayne. \nWayne nods. Phil stiffens. They do not like this guy. \nMAYOR (to the Sheriff) Mike, I gotta say, what you're doing... I don't know if I'd be here, considering. \nSHERIFF (good-natured) Well, you would be if you wanted to get the last couple of paychecks some bastard owed you. \nMAYOR (grins, then:) I just want you to know I think the people 'round here made a big mistake. \nPhil grumbles to himself. \nPHIL \"The people\"? You're the one who screwed him. \nMAYOR Sorry, Phil? \nPHIL (blushes) I, uh -- \nSHERIFF (to Mayor, saving Phil) You know, Bob, as much as I'd love to stand here all day talking about how great I am, if you don't get moving I'm gonna have to haul your sorry ass off to jail. \nMAYOR (laughs) Okay, okay, I'm going. Keep up the good work, boys. It's appreciated. \nThe Mayor rolls up his window and heads off. \nWAYNE Whaddya say we go torch the fucker's house and blame it on looters. Or how about we put a dead cow in his living room. He comes back after it's been in the water a couple of days. Hello! \nSHERIFF (shakes head) You wanna know how to get the best revenge on the Mayor and his boys? You do exactly what we're doing. You protect the town. You protect it better than they would. Better than they ever could. \nTOM You've got a major hair growth going on. \nCHARLIE Shut up. \nTOM I'm serious. You're gonna need somebody to go in there with a weed whacker. \nCharlie grabs a donut bag off the seat and tosses it to Tom. \nCHARLIE Here. \nTOM You're offering me one of your donuts? I don't know what to say. I'm getting all misty. \nCHARLIE If it'll shut your mouth you can have the whole bag. \nCharlie starts the truck. Tom thinks about it, then tosses the bag back. \nTOM Nah. I start eating donuts and I'll never get out of this truck. \nCHARLIE (disgusted) I love how you think you're better than this. \nTOM Don't get me wrong, Charlie. There's a lot to like about this job -- and I don't just mean the dashing polyester ensemble and the solid three-figure income. \nCHARLIE (angry) You ungrateful shit! I don't believe you! \nTOM (surprised) Charlie, relax! I was kidding! \nCHARLIE You don't wanna do this? Fine. Go back to selling hot construction machinery. That's a helluva career. \nTOM It had better hours. \nCharlie slams the clipboard down on the seat. \nCHARLIE You think this is a joke? This is funny? Jesus Christ! You know how lucky you are you could get in here? Thirty years old and all the crap you pulled and you never got caught? \nTOM (angry) That wasn't luck, old man. That was skill. I was good at it. \nCHARLIE Oh, yeah, it takes a lot of skill to fence bulldozers. That's goddamn genius time. \nTOM About as much skill as it takes to sit in a truck and get fat eating donuts. \nCHARLIE Oh, so that's all I've been doing, huh? Just wasting my life away. \nTOM I didn't say that. \nCHARLIE Yeah, building a home, raising a family -- that's just stupid. \nTOM I didn't say that! \nCHARLIE You know what, Tom? I really don't give a shit what you said. \nTom doesn't reply. Charlie puts the truck in gear; starts off. Tom looks at Charlie, shakes his head -- what was that about? \nEXT. ROADSIDE BAR - ESTABLISHING - DUSK \nINT. ROADSIDE BAR - DUSK ECU PEN ON PAPER \nWriting letters in a crossword puzzle. Holding the pen is... \nJIM \nLate 50s, with a creased face and piercing eyes. He's sitting at the bar, drinking coffee. Rain sheets down outside. The BARTENDER watches TV, sound off. Next to Jim at the bar are... \nRAY, KENNY AND MR. MEHLOR \nRay, 40s, has lank hair, rheumy eyes and a glass of Irish whisky in front of him. Kenny, 20s, long hair, has the energy of a puppy -- unfortunately he has about as much smarts as a puppy. Mr. Mehlor. 40s, looks like -- and was -- a high school teacher. \nON TV \nSound off, a MAN is crying about what he has lost in the flood. \nRAY \"Thus saith the Lord; Behold, waters shall rise up out of the north and be an overflowing flood and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.\" Jeremiah 47:2. \nRay takes a drink. Kenny leans over to Ray, sotto. \nKENNY You're gonna be able to buy a helluva lot of bibles, huh, Ray? Me? First thing I'm gonna do is get my brother a lawyer. Best that money can buy. \nA thought comes to Jim -- an answer to a clue in the crossword -- and he starts filling in words as Ray and Kenny talk. \nRAY What's he facing? \nKENNY Thirty in. \nRAY He cap a cop or something...? \nKENNY Security guard. \"In the commission...\" All he's got is a piece of shit P.D. Now I'm gonna be able to afford him a good lawyer -- a guy with a haircut. \nJim leans over to Kenny. \nJIM 'Scuse me a second. Take a look at thirty-one across. \nJim slides the newspaper in front of Kenny. \nKENNY Shit, Jim. I don't do crossword puzzles. \nMR. MEHLOR I'll take a look, Jim. \nJIM Kenny can read. (to Kenny) Just look at it. You know when you write down a word and suddenly it looks all wrong? Maybe it's right, but it doesn't look right? \nJim points at the newspaper. \nJIM Thirty-one across. \nKenny shrugs and looks down at the newspaper. \nKENNY (mumbles as he reads) Mention money again and... \nHis eyes go wide. \nHOME OF THE 1987 STATE CHAMPION WARRIORS. \nIN THE TRUCK \nCHARLIE Goddammit! \nTOM It's a little dip in the road or something. You can see the reflectors come up the other side. \nCHARLIE (curses to himself) I knew this would happen. (grabs radio mike) \nTOM I'll see if there's anyone coming. Maybe we can get pulled out. \nTom opens the door. Charlie adjusts the radio frequency selection button; clicks on. \nCHARLIE Dispatch, this is 31. 31 calling dispatch. \nDISPATCHER (V.O.) (over radio) 31, this is dispatch. \nCHARLIE (into radio) Dispatch, we're stuck outside of Huntingburg. Truck's dead. \nDISPATCHER (V.O.) Where are you? \nCHARLIE We're on 231, headed for the Interstate. Right by a sign saying \"Welcome to Huntingburg.\" \nTom climbs out and up on top of the truck. \nOUTSIDE THE TRUCK \nTom stands on top of the truck. In one direction, nothing but blackness. The other way he can see the lights of the town. But there are no cars coming. \nIN THE TRUCK \nCharlie looks over as Tom appears, upside-down, in the doorway. \nTOM The town's been evacuated. We won't get any help from there. \nCHARLIE Dispatch can't get anyone out. \nTOM They are aware we're carrying a shitload of money...? \nCHARLIE They called the National Guard. They're gonna be here in about ninety minutes. \nTOM Ninety minutes? Jesus. \nCHARLIE (nods; into radio) Dispatch, we're gonna need help a little sooner than -- \nThere's a sudden sparking sound and the radio cuts out and interior lights and the headlights go out. \nTOM Oh, shit. \nINT. HOUSE - DUSK POV THROUGH WINDOW \nLooking out as the Sheriff's car rolls past on the water- covered street. A HAND lets go of a curtain and it swings across the window. \nEXT. STREET - DUSK IN THE SHERIFF'S CAR \nThe Sheriff motions Wayne to stop the car, then he grabs the radio mike and clicks it on as a megaphone. \nSHERIFF (into mike) Henry, I saw you. Come on out. \nNo one comes out of the house. \nSHERIFF Henry, I'm not leaving until you come out. \nA few moments pass and then... \nHENRY AND DOREEN SWERZKY \nLate 70s, step out onto their porch. \nDOREEN Jesus H. Christ, Henry, I told you to stay away from the damn window. \nTHE SHERIFF \nGets out of the car. \nSHERIFF What are you still doing here? \nHENRY We're just -- \nDOREEN We're setting traps. \nSHERIFF That's illegal, Doreen. \nDOREEN You gonna arrest us, Sheriff? Hell, are you even sheriff anymore, Sheriff? Didn't you lose an election? I sure as hell know I didn't vote for you, and neither did Henry. \nHENRY Doreen... \nSHERIFF You don't need to set traps. \nDOREEN That's what they said in '73. When we got back, anything the bastards didn't steal they broke, just for the hell of it. \nSHERIFF That's not happening this time. \nDOREEN Damn right it's not. \nSHERIFF You can't stay, you know that. \nHENRY We're going to my sister's. \nSHERIFF Good. \nDOREEN Soon as we finish setting the traps. \nThe Sheriff wants to say something more, but he's not about to argue with Doreen. He just nods and gets back into the car. \nIN THE CAR \nStiffens. \nKENNY'S FINGER \nSqueezes the trigger of his rifle. \nTOM \nJumps at the sound of the rifle crack. \nCHARLIE \nIs knocked back. \nTOM \nYanks out his gun and starts shooting back. \nJIM AND HIS MEN \nDuck down in the water. \nTOM \nShooting blindly, looks over and sees... \nCHARLIE \nA horrible look on his face, blood coming out of his neck. He sinks into the water. \nKENNY \nShoots off another few quick rounds. \nTOM \nDrops into the water, bullets plugging in around him. Just his hand and pistol are visible, shooting blindly back toward Jim and his men. THE SUBURBAN \nIs hit by Tom's fire. \nTOM \nRuns out of bullets. A beat later we see Charlie start moving through the water -- Tom is pulling him. \nJIM STOP SHOOTING! \nKENNY \nDoesn't hear Jim and keeps firing. \nJIM \nAims his pistol at Kenny's head. \nJIM Stop. \nKenny stops. \nBEHIND THE ARMORED TRUCK \nTom comes up in the water behind the truck, gasping, holding Charlie. Tom rests his gun on the truck bumper. \nCHARLIE I'm sorry, Tom. \nCharlie's gone. \nJIM AND HIS MEN \nJim glares at Kenny, his eyes on fire. \nKENNY He was going for his gun! \nJIM He wasn't gonna shoot, Kenny. Goddamnit! (shakes head, calls to Tom) We just want the money! Get away and we won't have to kill you! \nTOM \nShuts his eyes, thinking, scared. \nJIM (O.S.) Now! \nTom opens his eyes. He looks down at... \nCHARLIE \nFloating in the water. \nTOM \nWhat the hell is he going to do? \nJIM AND HIS MEN \nJim's men look at him. Jim motions them to wait some more. \nJIM You got thirty seconds to get the hell away! \nJim and the others wait, but there's no answer from Tom. \nJIM The clock's running! Go! \nStill no response from Tom. \nTHEIR POV \nAll they can see is the front of the truck, in the light of the \"Welcome\" sign. They can't see the back. \nJIM AND HIS MEN \nKENNY \nFires, misses and is knocked to the side as... \nTOM \nHunches down on the jet-ski and crashes through the windows. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL \nJim and Mr. Mehlor are moving right outside the windows just as Tom blasts out of the school and races off into the dark. \nEXT. OPEN WATER \nTom moves fast over the water. He yanks off his clip-on tie. \nJIM AND THE OTHERS \nChase Tom's light, behind by fifty yards, heading out into farm fields. They get closer and closer and then watch as... \nTOM'S JET-SKI \nRuns straight into a tree and explodes. \nJIM AND THE OTHERS \nRace up to find the burning, flaming wreckage of the jet- ski. Ray circles on the other jet-ski. Kenny, still bleeding from the head, is in the boat with Jim and Mr. Mehlor. \nKENNY (laughing) Nice driving, buttwipe! \nRAY I'm glad you're enjoying this, Kenny, but if he's dead, how do we find the money? \nKenny reacts -- oh, right. \nJIM Oh, he's still alive. \nWe see what Jim sees. \nECU THROTTLE OF JET-SKI \nTom used his tie to wrap the throttle open. \nHUNDRED YARDS AWAY \nTom is hiding in the branches of a floating tree, watching the distant lights of Jim and his men. The current carries Tom away. \nWITH JIM AND HIS MEN \nJim scans the horizon; sees nothing. \nJIM Ray, I'm in need of a little inspiration. \nRAY \"With a raging flood he makes an end of those who oppose him, and pursues his enemies into darkness.\" From one of the more obscure -- \nKENNY Sorry to interrupt Bible study and all, but has no one but me noticed how completely screwed we are? We should be back in the motel room, counting out the money. Instead -- \nJim lashes out with a fist, hard and fast, hitting Kenny in the chest, knocking him out of the ski-boat, into the water. Kenny comes up in the thigh-deep water, sputtering. \nJIM No one likes this particular turn of events, Kenny, but we have a choice -- we can can either deal with it or we can walk away. There's a lot of money out there, so I choose to deal with it. If you want to go, that's fine -- start swimming. You want to stay, that's fine, too -- just stop your damn whining. \nJim pushes the throttle forward and the ski-boat takes off, leaving Ray on the jet-ski, with Kenny in the water. \nKENNY What the hell's his problem? All the money in the world ain't worth a goddamn nickel if you get caught. It's not like there won't be other jobs. \nRAY You may have more of these in you, Kenny, but Jim doesn't. \nRay pulls Kenny up onto the jet-ski and takes off after Jim. \nEXT. BACK OF CHURCH - SANDBAG WALL \nThe water level is creeping up a five-foot-high wall of sandbags. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nLooking out over the top of the sandbag wall. A tree floats by on the water. \nHANDS \nSuddenly appear on the top of the wall and... \nTOM \nPulls himself into view. He climbs over the wall, exhausted. \nBEHIND THE SANDBAG WALL \nGasoline-powered pumps are sucking up any rainwater. The sandbags have kept the floodwater at bay. \nTOM \nHe hurries up the back steps and goes into the church. \nINT. CHURCH - BACK ROOM \nTom walks through a small room lined with closed cupboards. He goes through a door. \nINT. CHURCH - MAIN HALL \nTom comes out into the altar. He looks around, impressed. It's a beautiful church. Scaffolding goes up one wall -- the church is being restored. Tom is startled by a sound from above. He grabs a heavy silver candlestick as a weapon and looks up to see... \nBIRDS \nFluttering up in the rafters. \nTOM \nTakes a breath. Just as he relaxes, he hears a whooshing sound from behind him and turns to see... \nSHERIFF Jesus, Wayne, use your head. If he hadn't hidden it, they woulda killed him, too. \nThe Sheriff looks at Tom -- is that it? Tom nods. \nSHERIFF You got any ID? \nTOM No, it was in my jacket and I -- \nWAYNE Color me surprised. \nThe Sheriff thinks for a beat, then tosses some keys to Phil. \nSHERIFF Get out two rifles and a shotgun. \nPhil nods and goes to it. The Sheriff opens a desk drawer, pulls out an ankle holster. \nWAYNE You believe him? \nSHERIFF Well, yes, Wayne, I do. And even if I didn't, I'd say we sure as hell had an obligation to check it out, don't you think? \nThe Sheriff starts strapping on the ankle holster. \nTOM I'll go with you. I can show you where -- \nSHERIFF No, I think you better stay put. But that was -- \nWAYNE Yeah, all we need is an armored car guy helping us out. \nThe Sheriff thwacks Wayne in the ear. \nWAYNE Ow! \nSHERIFF Wayne, what's the worst that's ever happened to you? When old Mrs. Dugan went after you with a knife? This guy just got shot at! (dismisses Wayne; to Tom) Smart move with the money. \nPhil comes over with the guns. \nSHERIFF (to Phil) Wayne and I'll check out the cemetery. You escort Slugger... (nods at Karen) ...out of town. Get her to some high ground, then come on back. \nThe Sheriff jams a small pistol into his ankle holster. \nKAREN I have to fill the pumps -- \nSHERIFF (pulling her out) Not any more you don't. \nThe Sheriff straightens up, grabs a rifle from Phil and pulls Karen to the door. Wayne goes to Tom's cell door and pulls it shut with a click. \nSHERIFF Wayne... \nWAYNE He could still be lying! \nThe Sheriff rolls his eyes and gestures for Wayne to come along. He opens the door for Karen, Wayne and Phil to go through. \nTOM Sheriff -- they killed my partner without any warning. \nSHERIFF And they're gonna regret that, I guarantee you. They're gonna regret coming anywhere near this town tonight. And out he goes. \nEXT. SHERIFF'S STATION \nWater is halfway up the four-foot high wall of sandbags around the station. There are three outboard motorboats moored to the sandbags. \nSHERIFF Phil, take Karen's boat. \nThe Sheriff and Wayne climb toward their boats. \nWAYNE You can do it, Phil. The men of Huntingburg are counting on you. \nPHIL Just bite me. \nWayne laughs as he and the Sheriff fire up their boat engines. \nINT. SHERIFF'S STATION \nTom hears boat engines start up and move away. He lays back down on the cot, listening to the rain. \nINT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE \nEmpty. Light comes out from under the door to the bathroom. \nINT. BATHROOM \nHank is on the can reading a copy of \"American Survivalist\" magazine. An odd reaction comes over his face. He feels something weird. He looks down. \nON THE FLOOR \nWater is seeping in under the door. \nHANK Holy shit! \nINT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE \nThe bathroom door flies open and Hank waddles out, pants around his feet. He shuffles fast to the control wheels and starts spinning them. \nEXT. RESERVOIR DAM \nTwo gates open fast, all the way, and water thunders out. \nINT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE \nHank pulls up his pants as he gets on the radio. \nHANK Sheriff! Sheriff! \nEXT. PARK AREA \nThe Sheriff and Wayne are motoring in their boats, zooming through the trees, engine noise obliterating anything coming in over the radio. \nINT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE \nLaying on the Sheriff's wooden desk. They're four feet away -- too far to reach. \nEXT. CHURCH \nKaren suddenly has a horrible thought and stops. She shakes it off -- doesn't want to think about it -- and mutters to herself. \nKAREN They'll get him out. \nEXT. MAIN STREET \nPhil is clinging to the statue as the water surges by below him. \nEXT. PARK AREA \nWayne gets back into his boat. The Sheriff realizes something. \nSHERIFF Wayne... You locked him in. \nINT. SHERIFF'S STATION \nTom looks through the cell bars at wooden chairs bobbing in the water. The Sheriff's desk lifts up, starts floating. Tom gets an idea. He takes his belt off. \nEXT. NEAR SHERIFF'S STATION \nA telephone pole is half-submerged, being pulled along fast by the current. \nINT. SHERIFF'S STATION \nTom holds one end of the belt and tosses the rest of it at... \nTHE DESK \nBobbing in the rising water. He misses the keys. \nTOM AND THE DESK \nTom tries again. The belt lands on the desk top. \nTom very gently starts pulling. Too hard; the belt starts slipping off the desk. He gets it just right and the desk starts moving toward Tom. He reaches out with his hand, stretching. \nHIS FINGERS \nTouch the top of the desk, start pulling it toward him, and he just gets a firm grip on the desk when... \nTHE TELEPHONE POLE \nSmashes into a window, bending in the bars on the window, shattering the glass, letting a torrent of water into the room. \nTHE DESK \nIs moved by the rush of water, but not before Tom grabs... \nTHE KEYS \nAnd grips them tight. \nTOM \nTries the keys in the lock. They don't fit. He looks at them. \nCU KEYS \nThe tag is emblazoned with the Ford logo. \nTOM Great! I can drive out of here! \nTom tosses the keys into the water and looks around at... \nTHE WATER LEVEL \nRising very fast. A foot in ten seconds. \nTOM \nClimbs up the cell bars, the water rising with him. He's running out of room between himself and the ceiling. Three feet. Two feet. He's being pushed up by the water toward... \nFLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE \nOn the ceiling, caged in a wire cover. \nTOM \nIs terrified, about to die. The water rises up past his face. \nTOM'S HANDS \nPull his Maglite flashlight from his belt. He takes off the lens and the battery cap, then shakes the batteries out. \nTOM \nSticks the flashlight tube up through the wire grate over the light fixture. \nHe blows out the water -- like clearing a snorkel -- then breathes. Reprieve for a few moments and then... \nTHE WATER \nReaches the top of the flashlight tube and starts to trickle in when... \nTHE FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE \nGoes dark. In the darkness, there's the sound of tubes breaking and metal being wrenched. \nTOM \nLooks up, astonished, to see... \nTHE FLUORESCENT FIXTURE \nKaren grabs Tom's arm and Tom gets a hold of the windowsill and pulls himself up. \nKENNY \nGrabs onto... \nTHE TV ANTENNA \nAnd starts pulling himself out of the water. \nTHE TRANSFORMER \nExplodes. \nKENNY \nFeels pretty pleased with himself until... \nTHE TV ANTENNA \nStarts dancing with electricity and... \nKENNY \nIs hit by the voltage and his teeth clamp shut and his body goes rigid and his clothes explode in flames. \nTOM AND KAREN \nLook away. \nTHE WATER \nDead fish start floating to the surface. \nKENNY \nIs fried, smoking. He falls off the TV antenna and hits the water with a loud and ugly hiss. He floats away, his body shaking spasmodically. \nTOM AND KAREN \nTom hears an engine approaching. He looks around, then smashes the window with his elbow. \nINT. HOUSE \nThe window glass tumbles in. Tom reaches in, undoes the latch and slides up the window. He climbs in, straddling the window sill. The camera moves down Tom's leg to show... \nA WOLF TRAP \nLaying on the floor, just below the window. \nTOM \nIs oblivious. He starts to put his foot down into the trap. Just then he knocks... \nA POTTED CACTUS \nOff the windowsill. It falls straight down into... \nTHE WOLF TRAP \nHitting the trigger. The jaws snap, obliterating the cactus. \nTOM Jesus Christ! \nA SHOTGUN BARREL \nSnaps into view, pointing right at Tom's head. \nWOMAN (O.S.) You so much as breathe funny and your head is going back out that window without you. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET \nJim drives the boat down the street. Mr. Mehlor is scanning the water with a flashlight. \nMR. MEHLOR Jim! Over there! \nJim looks over to see... \nTHE JET-SKI \nFloating in the water. And not far from it is... \nKENNY \nStill twitching. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. HOUSE - BEDROOM \nDoreen holds the shotgun on Tom and Karen as they move away from the window, hands raised. \nDOREEN Real slow now. Like you were in a big jar of molasses. That's it. \nThey hear footsteps coming down old wood stairs. \nMAN (O.S.) Doreen? You haven't killed anybody, have you? \nDOREEN I've got everything under control, Henry. You go back up. \nHenry enters. \nHENRY Jesus, Doreen, you caught a whole gang. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET \nThe Sheriff sits in his boat, moored to the wall of sandbags around the church. Wayne's boat is tied up next to it. The floodwater is trickling over the top of the wall. The gas- powered pumps inside the wall are keeping the waters at bay. \nWAYNE AND PHIL \nCome out of the front doors of the church. \nWAYNE They're not here. \nEXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN \nTom rows up to the truck and \"Welcome\" sign. His flashlight shows just the top of the truck and sign. Tom looks at his watch, ties the rowboat to the sign, jumps into the water. \nA few moments pass, then Tom surfaces, holding a shotgun. Then he senses something behind him and turns to see... \nA COW \nFloating in the water, tongue out, eyes glassy. \nTOM \nKicks away, horrified. And then he hears an engine. He looks. \nTOM'S POV \nJim's ski-boat is coming over the water. The engine cuts out and the ski-boat drifts, a hundred feet from Tom. \nJIM (yelling) Son, before you go underwater and do something tricky, there's something I'd like you to see! \nA flashlight comes on, the beam swivels, illuminating... \nHENRY AND DOREEN \nStanding in the ski-boat, blinking in the light. \nTOM \nSlumps. \nJIM Now, I know it's your job to protect that money, and maybe you'd even be foolish enough to give your life for it. The question is, are you willing to give their lives for it? \nJim puts a pistol to Doreen's head. \nJIM Drop the gun and get into the boat. \nTOM \nThinks for a second, then throws the shotgun away and pulls himself into the rowboat. \nJIM Excellent choice. \nTOM, JIM, HENRY AND DOREEN \nAs Tom and Jim call to each other across the water, Doreen goes at Henry. \nTOM I'll take you to the money, but you gotta let them go. \nDOREEN I hope you're proud of yourself, Henry Sears. \nHENRY Shh. \nJIM I think it'd be best if -- \nDOREEN I told you not to give him the goddamn boat. \nHENRY Doreen, please. \nJIM I think it'd be best if we all stayed together. \nTOM You say all you want is the money? Prove it. Let them go. \nJIM I don't know if that's -- \nDOREEN We could be safe in our home instead of out here in a boat with these low- life scumbags! \nJIM (after a look at Doreen, nods to Mr. Mehlor) Let 'em go. \nEXT. MAIN STREET \nThe Sheriff, Wayne and Phil motor past the statue. Wayne is driving his boat; Phil is with the Sheriff. The water is up to the General's neck. \nEXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN \nTom helps Henry and Doreen over into the rowboat. As he does, his face comes close to Henry's for a second. \nTOM (whisper) Karen? \nHENRY (shakes head, whispers) In the attic. They never saw her. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET \nKaren swims down the center of the street. \nEXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN \nTom is in the ski-boat with Jim. He looks out at... \nHENRY AND DOREEN \nAs Henry rows them off into the darkness. \nDOREEN (disappearing in dark) Faster, Henry! The bastards might change their minds! Stop lily- dipping and move it! \nHenry starts to turn the boat around. \nDOREEN What're you doing? \nHENRY I'm gonna row back there and see if he'll shoot you. Or me. Fine either way. \nSHERIFF Hank, remember when Mike Crane holed up in Jack Finch's barn and said he was gonna burn it down? \nCROSSCUT WITH HANK \nHANK Hey, I was the one who got the dumb son-of-a-bitch to come out. \nSHERIFF Right. And before you went in, I deputized you, you dumb son-of-a- bitch! So when I say get down here, it's not a request, it's an order. So get down here! Now! I won't need you for long. And bring your gun. \nEXT. CEMETERY \nJIM We were gonna hit you just before you got on the Interstate, but then you got stuck so we had to change our plans and take you -- \nTOM Bullshit. This is all bullshit. \nJIM I knew Charlie when we were both working construction for the Johnstown company. His middle name was McCarthy because his parents loved Charlie McCarthy on the radio. His wife's name was Mary. She died of a heart- attack last year. He has a daughter and a son, both grown with children of their own. I'm afraid I don't know the names of the grandchildren. \nTom looks down, not wanting to believe. \nJIM What else do I know...? Oh, yes. I know Uncle Charlie was trying to steer his favorite nephew away from a life of crime. \nTom suddenly lunges for Jim. Ray yanks Tom back. \nTOM Why'd you shoot him? Kill Charlie and you get to keep another share? \nJIM No, That was an accident. Ken shot him. (eyes Kenny sadly) I never told him Charlie was on my side. Ken liked to talk. (shakes head) He shouldn't've been here. But his dad asked me to watch over him. I guess I didn't do the best job. \nRAY Excuse me, Jim. I hate to interrupt and all, but could we just get the money and get the hell out of here? \nJIM (nods; to Tom) I'm gonna ask you one more time. And before you think of bullshitting me again, keep in mind I have had a very frustrating night. And while I know I'll never get the money if I kill you, it's getting to the point where I just don't care. \nJim casually aims his gun at Tom. \nTOM I'll tell you where it is. But it's not going to do you any good. \nJim arches an eyebrow. \nTOM The Guard may not be coming, but someone else sure as hell is. \nEXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN THE SHERIFF \nAt the controls of his boat, moving fast, sprayed by rain. Karen and Phil are in the back of the boat. Wayne is close behind in his boat. \nEXT. CEMETERY \nJIM I'll take my chances. \nTom pauses, looks over to... \nTHE CRYPT \nJust the top of it is visible. Two more COFFINS float nearby. \nTOM There. \nJim steers the ski-boat over, hands Tom a flashlight. \nJIM Well, go get it. \nTom climbs over the edge of the ski-boat and into the water. He turns on the flashlight and drops below the surface. \nRAY (eyeing Tom in water) \"At night we'd go down to the river and into the river we'd dive.\" (off Jim and Mehlor's looks) Springsteen, \"The River.\" I'm all out of bible quotes. \nUNDERWATER \nTom shines his light on... \nTHE CRYPT \nOne end of a rope is tied to the crypt. The other end, cut and frayed, is suspended in the water, waving in the current. \nON THE WATER \nJim watches Tom's light rise. Tom comes up fast, takes a breath. \nTOM It's gone. \nJIM What? \nTOM (smug) Looks like somebody beat you to it. \nRAY Oh for Christs -- I'm gonna shoot him, Jim. \nRay grabs pistol in his belt. Before he can pull it out, holes puff out of his chest, followed by blood and then the sound of the rifle-shots. Ray tumbles into the water. A half- second later there's... \nHAIL OF BULLETS \nRipping into the ski-boat, water, trees, crypt. \nTHE SHERIFF'S BOAT, WAYNE'S BOAT \nAre outside the fence, a hundred feet from the crypt. PUSH IN FAST on... \nTHE SHERIFF \nTo the rescue. He and Wayne and Phil fire their guns. \nTOM \nDucks underwater. \nJIM \nPulls his pistol, returns fire. \nMR. MEHLOR \nOpens fire with a shotgun, shooting wild, yelling. Then he's hit and knocked out of the boat, dead. \nWITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN \nThe Sheriff and Wayne reload. \nHANK (O.S.) Anyone mind telling me what the hell is going on? \nThe Sheriff, Wayne and Phil turn to see... \nHANK \nIn his boat, right behind them, all dressed up in hunting gear, rifle at the ready. \nSHERIFF Hey, Hank. That money I told you about? From the armored car? We're gonna keep it. Three million dollars. Four ways. (shoots at crypt) Seven fifty apiece. You okay with that? \nHank is stunned. He doesn't answer. \nSHERIFF Hank? You okay with that? \nHANK Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars? (beat, grins) Damn straight I'm okay with that. \nWAYNE (grumbling, re: Hank) Don't see what we needed him for. \nSHERIFF Then I guess you've never been hunting with Hank. (to Hank) We got two behind that crypt. Get 'em. \nHank nods. He motions for Wayne to go one way; he'll go the other. They start off. A blind shot comes from Jim behind the crypt. The Sheriff shoots back. Phil finally musters up the courage to say something. \nPHIL Maybe I'm not okay with it. \nSHERIFF Come on now, Phil. \nPHIL You're gonna kill people? \nSHERIFF They're looters, Phil! They come and steal from an armored truck in our town -- they're looters. (fires two shots) \nPHIL What about Tom? What about Karen? They're not looters. \nSHERIFF No, they're witnesses. \nThe Sheriff fires off a flurry of bullets. \nTOM AND JIM \nBehind the crypt, bullets winging by. Jim looks over, sees... \nHANK \nMotor into view. \nJIM \nOpens fire. \nHANK \nShoots back. \nTOM \nFlattens against the crypt, then turns to see... \nWAYNE \nComing into view on the other side. \nTOM \nLooks at Jim, sees he's occupied in the fight with Hank. Then he sees... \nRAY \nFloating in the water, dead, pistol still jammed in his pants. \nTOM \nThinks, decides, and reaches out for Ray. \nCLOSE ON JIM \nShooting at Hank. He hears gunfire from Wayne and is about to swivel to shoot in that direction when he hears a gun firing from right next to him. He turns to see... \nTOM \nShooting back at Wayne with Ray's gun. \nWAYNE \nPulls back out of the line of fire. \nHANK \nCurses and pulls back, too. \nTOM AND JIM \nExchange a look. \nTHE SHERIFF'S BOAT \nPHIL How can you do this? \nSHERIFF Jeez, Phil, I always thought Wayne was the stupid one. Read my lips. (slowly) Three million dollars. Look at it! \nThe Sheriff reaches down into a forward storage area of the boat and pulls back a tarp revealing the bags of money. \nSHERIFF A couple of those bags are gonna be yours, Phil. \nPHIL But -- but -- you're the Sheriff! \nJIM Does he have the girl? \nTOM (shakes head) She's in the small boat. \nTom touches the wound on his head. \nTOM Jesus, I'm gonna get hepatitis. \nJIM Hepatitis, hell. You probably already got cholera. \nTom gives Jim a look then starts for the back of the church. \nJIM What're you doing? \nTOM There's a back room. (touches wound) Maybe they've got something I can use on this. \nJIM You been in here before? \nTOM (bad memory) Oh, yeah. \nJIM What happened? \nTOM I saw Jesus. \nEXT. DAM \nWater is starting to go over the top again. It pours down in sheets over the face of the dam. \nINT. CHURCH \nJim is by the window, looking out at the Sheriff and Wayne across the street in the shadows. He turns as... \nTOM \nEnters from the back. He's got a bottle of rubbing alcohol and a towel. He splashes some of the alcohol on the towel, then touches it to his wound. It hurts like a sonofabitch. After a beat... \nTOM So, has this all gone pretty much how you thought it would? \nJim turns on Tom. \nJIM Everything would have gone fine if you'd've just walked away from the truck. \nTOM Oh, yeah? Well, everything would've gone even better if you hadn't decided to rob the damn truck in the first place! \nJim looks away. After another silence... \nTOM Did Charlie have cancer or something? \nJIM You mean why was he doing this? (thinks, shrugs) No cancer. (beat) Didn't you ever think about taking the money? \nTOM No. \nJIM Come now. A man who used to make his living fencing hot jackhammers never thought about what he'd do with three million dollars? \nTOM Sorry to disappoint you. (beat) What are you gonna do with it? \nJIM As little as possible. \nSilence for a few moments, then... \nTOM Belize. \nJim looks at him. \nTOM It's this small country in Central America, on the Atlantic side. \nJIM I know where Belize is. What about it? \nTOM They speak English and the dollar goes a long way. Beautiful beaches; friendly people. And they've got liberal banking laws. Very liberal. \nJIM No, you didn't think about taking that money at all. \nTOM (busted) You can't ride in the truck and not think about it. \nJIM I'm sure. And I guess that's pretty much how it started with Charlie. \nTom thinks, nods and presses the towel to his wound again. \nEXT. MAIN STREET \nWayne is thinking about something. He makes a decision and flicks on his engine. \nSHERIFF What're you doing? \nWAYNE We got too many bodies with bullets in 'em. (nods at Karen) I'm gonna put her in her house, make it look like she fell down the stairs and drowned. \nPHIL Don't you touch her! \nWAYNE Saving her life... Hmm... You know, that might have actually gotten you laid. \nSHERIFF Oh, for Christsakes, just dump her here. \nWAYNE We got a few minutes before Hank gets back. \nSHERIFF Just dump her here! \nWayne ignores the Sheriff and motors off. \nSHERIFF Wayne! Goddamnit, we've gotta get them outta there! Wayne! \nBut Wayne keeps going. \nINT. CHURCH \nTom watches Wayne drive off with Karen. \nTOM Shit. Where's he going? \nTHE OVERHEAD LIGHT \nSparks and goes out. \nWAYNE (looks up at light) That won't do. Man's gotta see what he's doing. 'Scuse me. \nWayne heads off for the kitchen. The second he's gone... \nKAREN \nRaises her hips and digs a hand into her pocket and pulls out her Swiss Army knife. She pries open the big blade. She hears Wayne sloshing back toward her. She gets back into the position Wayne left her in as... \nWAYNE \nRe-enters carrying two burning candles in candle-holders. \nWAYNE I got the candles. All's we need is a cake. \nHe sets the candles down on a dry step above Karen's head. He leans in close. \nWAYNE Mood lighting. You in the mood yet? (no answer from Karen; back into Penthouse letter) And then she said, \"My present's ready and waiting. All's you gotta do is unwrap it.\" \nWayne reaches into the water, undoes Karen's rain pants, yanks off her shoes, then pulls off her pants. He throws them over the banister. Karen remains passive, blank. Wayne takes off his holster; hangs it on the banister. Then he pushes his pants down to his ankles. His shirttail is long enough so that we don't have to see his wretched little pecker. He climbs on top of Karen in the water, brings his face close to hers. \nWAYNE It was cold and rainy that birthday night, and all I wanted was to get someplace warm and dry. As it turned out, what I really wanted was something warm and wet. Wayne grins and closes for a kiss and... \nKAREN'S HAND \nMoves fast with the knife and... \nWAYNE'S EYES \nPop open wide. \nWAYNE \nHis head jerks back. He tries to shout, but all that comes out is an awful gurgle. He tries to push off Karen, but... \nKAREN \nWraps her legs around him, holds him close, pinning him. \nWAYNE \nFinally breaks free. He tries to stop the bleeding with a hand, but the blood spurts through his fingers. He reaches for his gun in his holster on the banister, but just as he grabs it... \nKAREN \nLashes out of the water with her legs, kicking Wayne in the groin, pushing him back. \nWAYNE \nTries to get his balance, but his feet can't move -- his pants are around his ankles. He falls back into the water, firing his pistol. \nBULLETS \nBlow chunks out of the wall next to Karen, hit the ceiling and... \nWAYNE \nIs floating on his back, trying to lift the pistol, but his strength is fading fast. He gets off one last shot and... \nTHE CANDLE \nNearest Karen is blown to pieces. \nWAYNE \nThe gun drops into the water. No more shots. No more life. He floats, pants around his ankles, covered in blood, dead. \nKAREN Happy Birthday, Wayne. \nEXT. STREET AND CHURCH \nThe church roof is on fire. \nTHE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK \nAre across the street. \nINT. CHURCH \nJim and Tom hear a creaking and look up. \nTHE CEILING \nThe fire has eaten holes in the roof. Embers come down. \nEXT. CHURCH AND STREET \nThe Sheriff is getting very agitated. \nSHERIFF They're not coming out, Hank! \nHANK The fire's not catching. The rain's too -- \nSHERIFF We have to get them! We have to kill them! Do you understand? If they're not dead, we got jack shit! \nINT. CHURCH \nA small chunk of burning ceiling drops down. Jim and Tom look up. Just then... \nBRIGHT LIGHT \nFloods into the church through... \nTHE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS \nBLAZING TIMBERS \nStart to fall from the burning roof frame, hitting the water with loud sizzling hisses. \nTHE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK \nTurn to shoot at tom through the dropping flaming debris. \nTOM \nDisappears up the stairs, the bullets just missing him. \nUNDERWATER \nJim runs out of bullets. He's long since run out of air. He drops his guns and swims under the pews. \nHANK \nLooks up, realizing that Tom will be able to shoot down on him. He reverses his boat fast under the balcony as... \nTOM \nShoots down from the balcony, blowing a chunk out of the prow of Hank's boat. \nINT. KAREN'S HOUSE \nThe water is up to Karen's chin. Her hands are working frantically beneath the water. \nUNDERWATER \nShe's using the tip of the knife blade to unscrew the screws holding the support to the railing. She's on the last one. The blade slips, misses, gets a quarter turn, another quarter turn... \nKAREN \nSpits out the water that spills into her mouth. \nUNDERWATER \nAnother quarter-turn and the screw is loose enough to turn by hand. \nKAREN \nHolds her breath with the water touching her nose. She gets the screw loose, pulls up on the railing and pulls the handcuff through the gap between the support and the railing. \nINT. CHURCH \nThe Sheriff turns to Phil and nods re: Jim. \nSHERIFF You take care of him! \nThe Sheriff aims at the balcony as Phil scans the water, looking for Jim. \nUNDERWATER \nJim pulls an electrical cord out of a wall socket. \nON THE BALCONY \nTom ducks down as the Sheriff's bullets start plugging through the wood front of the balcony. Tom moves away from the bullet strikes, splashing through the water in the balcony. \nCLOSE ON BALCONY FLOOR \nAs BANG BANG BANG -- bullets start shooting up from below. \nHANK \nIs firing up at Tom through the floor of the balcony. \nTOM \nJumps back, startled, looking down at... \nTHE BALCONY FLOOR \nHoles explode in the floor, sending up small geysers of water. The water then starts whirlpooling down through the holes. \nTOM \nMoves back from hank's advancing bullet holes. \nTHE SHERIFF \nKeeps firing. \nTOM \nIs caught between Hank's bullets and the Sheriff's bullets. So he racks a load in the shotgun and dives backwards off the balcony. \nHANK \nIs still shooting up as... \nTOM \nArcs off the balcony, firing the shotgun under the balcony at Hank. \nHANK \nDives to the floor of his boat as Tom's shotgun blasts blow plate-sized holes in the church doors. \nTOM \nLands in the water and goes under. \nTHE SHERIFF AND PHIL \nLook for Tom in the water. \nKAREN \nTugs at the railing, tries rocking it up and down. It doesn't budge. She starts chipping at the plaster with the knife. \nKAREN God, I am really beginning to hate fine craftsmanship. \nTHE WATER \nIt's up to her chest. \nINT. CHURCH \nThe Sheriff hesitates. \nTOM Where is she? \nSHERIFF They went back to her house. \nTOM Where's her house? \nSHERIFF It's -- \nAnd just then they all hear something truly ominous -- a siren pierces the night. \nINT. KAREN'S HOUSE \nShe reacts to the siren -- uh-oh. \nINT. CHURCH \nThe siren wails. \nJIM What in God's name is that? \nSHERIFF Hank? \nHANK (woozy but okay) It's topped out. \nSHERIFF How much time we got? \nHANK How should I know? \nSHERIFF Guess! \nHANK It's an old dam! Not long. \nSHERIFF (to Tom) Then I'd say you boys better drop your guns. \nTOM What? \nSHERIFF That's the deal! You let me and Hank go -- with a few of these bags -- and I'll tell you where to find Karen. \nJIM (to the Sheriff) Get out of the boat. \nTOM Hold on. \nJim turns to look at Tom. \nJIM Hold on? \nSHERIFF It's the only way you're gonna find her! \nTOM It's only a couple of bags. \nJIM No. \nTOM But I thought -- \nJIM Look, I don't know what you thought but I told you, I'm here for the money; that's all. \nTom doesn't know what to do. The Sheriff looks pretty pleased with himself. He might just get out of this. And then... \nPHIL (O.S.) She lives on Boyd Street. \nThey all look over at... \nPHIL \nAlive, but barely. \nPHIL Three over. Two-story, blue shutters. \nTOM \nLooks at Jim, disappointed, angry, then hurries to Hank's boat. \nJIM \nClimbs into the Sheriff's boat. \nTOM \nClimbs into Hank's boat. He starts the engine, looks down at... \nPHIL \nFloating in the water, dying. A brief look between them, then... \nTOM \nDrives the boat out through a shattered window. \nJIM \nPushes the Sheriff out of the boat. \nEXT. RESERVOIR DAM \nSHERIFF Yeah, you're right. \nThe Sheriff pushes Hank out of the boat. \nHANK \nGoes skipping over the water and slams into a streetlight post. \nINT. KAREN'S HOUSE \nTom swims down into the living room. His light shows a couch, chairs, TV set. Books and newspapers are suspended in the water. \nEXT. THE CHURCH \nThe damaged ski-boat that Jim and Tom took to the church has slipped off the sandbag wall and is drifting. A peaceful scene. But then, from the distance, comes a rushing roar. \nINT. CHURCH \nPhil hears the roar. He looks around, lost. \nEXT. STREET \nHank, groggy in the water, also hears the distant roar. \nINT. CHURCH \nThe roar is building, getting louder. Phil sees something in the water and reaches for it, frantically. He gets it. It's... \nA BIBLE \nAnd he clutches it to his chest as... \nTHE FLOOD \nHits the church. \nINT. KAREN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN \nTom swims into the kitchen. He looks for the tall cupboard by the fridge. He opens it. \nINSIDE THE CUPBOARD \nHanging on a hook on the back wall is a saw. Tom grabs it. \nEXT. MAIN STREET \nHank unwraps himself from around the lamp post. He looks back. \nHIS POV \nStreetlights in the distance, winking out one by one, marking the advance of the wall of water. \nHANK Oh my God. \nHank looks around for safety. He sees it. \nHIS POV \nThere's an alleyway. \nHANK \nSwims for the alley. \nEXT. THE ADVANCING FLOOD \nRoars through the town, pushing a rolling wave of debris, obliterating anything in its path. \nEXT. ALLEY \nHank swims into the alley. Hank looks for something to climb up on, to hold onto. There's... \nFIRE ESCAPE LADDER \nAt the end of the alley. \nHANK \nSwims for it. He hears the rushing roar of the advancing flood. He expects the flood to blow by the end of the alley. Wrong. \nWALL OF WATER \nComes into the alley, banking high on the far wall before coming down and barreling toward Hank. And what makes it worse for Hank is that there's... \nA CAR \nAt the front of the wave, being pushed by the water. \nHANK \nDives clear just as... \nTHE CAR \nSmashes into the wall, right where Hank had just been. \nHANK \nRelief in his eyes. He gets to the fire escape and is climbing to safety when... \nPROPANE TANK \nComes into the alley, rolling in the flood, spraying propane from a torn hose. It explodes. \nHANK \nBarely has time to scream. \nBRIGHT WHITE LIGHT \nAnd they look to see... \nTHE SHERIFF \nIn his boat, shining a searchlight on them with one hand, a gun in the other. He starts shooting. \nTOM AND KAREN \nTom pushes Karen toward the peak of the roof as the bullets plug in around them. Tom pushes Karen over the top then turns and dives off the roof and into the water. \nKAREN \nHears an engine behind her and turns. \nA BOAT \nRacing toward the house. It's... \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nAnd at the controls is... \nJIM \nBarely alive. \nTHE OUTBOARD MOTOR \nIs wobbling, vibrating at the back of the boat, almost loose from its moorings. \nJIM'S POV \nHe sees Karen, crouched below the peak of the house, a bright light coming from the other side along with gunshots. \nJIM \nPushes the throttle all the way forward. \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nShoots forward. \nUNDERWATER \nTom swims hard toward the Sheriff's boat. \nTHE SHERIFF \nIs shooting down into the water at Tom's moving shape. \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nWith Jim at the wheel, comes racing straight toward the house. \nKAREN \nThinks he's going to turn. \nKAREN No! No! \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nDoesn't turn. \nKAREN \nRolls to the side, just getting clear as... \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nHits the sloping roof of Karen's house and ramps up it. \nTHE OUTBOARD MOTOR \nDigs into the shingles of the roof and tears free from the back of the boat. \nTHE SHERIFF \nHears the sound and looks up as... \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nComes over the peak of the roof. \nTOM \nSurfaces to see... \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nFly right over him, heading straight for... \nTHE SHERIFF \nWho ducks down, just in time as... \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nMisses him, landing just past him in the water. \nTHE SHERIFF \nStraightens up, grinning with glee that the boat missed him. And then he hears a piercing whine coming from behind him. He turns, just in time to see... \nTHE OUTBOARD MOTOR \n", "test1_input": "The name WILLIAM PORTMAN is chiseled into a crypt. Tom appears from underwater, gasping for breath. He gets to his feet and trudges off through the water. \nEXT. ROAD OUTSIDE CEMETERY \nTom comes out through the gates of the cemetery, splashing through the knee-deep water. He's running when he hears, from behind him, boat engines firing up. He turns to see... \nLIGHTS \nRacing toward him over the water, a hundred and fifty yards back. \nTOM \nSprints off. \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nJim is steering the ski-boat. Mr. Mellor hunkers down beside him. We PULL BACK to see... \nTWO JET-SKIS \nFlanking the ski-boat, piloted by Kenny and Ray. \nON THE ROAD \nTom is running as fast as he can. He looks back, sees the ski-boat and jet-skis closing. They'll get him before he gets to town. He suddenly veers off the road toward... \nTHE HIGH SCHOOL \nThe sign out front reads: GO WARRIORS! \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL \nTom runs around the side of the high school. \nJIM AND HIS MEN \nRide up on the ski-boat and jet-skis and round the corner. \nTHEIR POV \nNo sign of Tom. \nJIM Cut your engines! \nThe engines are shut down. They all drift. Jim shines a flashlight over onto... \nWINDOWS \nThere's a hole in a window large enough to climb through. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM \nTom wades through the classroom, pushing floating desks aside. Flashlight beams stab into the room. Tom hurries to the hall. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL \nJim turns to his men. \nJIM Let's get him out. But for Godsake, whatever you do... (with a hard look at Kenny) ...don't kill him. Not until we find out where he hid that money. \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY \nTom makes his way past banks of lockers, trying to get as far as he can from the probing flashlight beams. \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT DOORS \nKenny drifts up to the front doors. He pulls on them. Locked. \nJIM Mr. Mehlor? \nMR. MEHLOR \nReaches into his pack. \nINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY \nTom tries lockers, looking for a place to hide. \nEXT. FRONT DOORS \nKenny rides his jet-ski fast away from the front doors and the doors explode. \nINT. SCHOOL FRONT LOBBY \nTom ducks down as... \nA FIREBALL \nShoots over him. \nKENNY AND RAY \nRide the jet-skis into the flooded school. \nUNDERWATER \nTom is swimming as hard as he can, out of breath. KENNY AND RAY \nRay goes off down a hall while Kenny idles in the lobby. \nTOM \nSurfaces, gasping. \nKENNY \nHears the gasp, turns, grinning. \n", "test1_true": "TOM \nGets to his feet runs as fast as he can down the hall. He rounds a corner and keeps going. \nKENNY \nGuns his engine and takes off after Tom. \nTOM \nRuns another thirty feet, then trips on something and goes down. \nKENNY \nComes around the corner, grinning when he sees... \nTOM \nHalfway down the hall, standing frozen, caught in Kenny's light. \nKENNY \nGuns it, racing forward down the hall toward Tom. \nKENNY Full steam ahead! \nTHE JET-SKI \nHits something underwater and stops. \nKENNY \nKeeps going. He flies through the air, slams headfirst into a trophy case and drops into the water. \nTOM \nStands up -- he was kneeling. \nTOM Low tide, sailor. \nA HANDRAIL \nOn the wall, angles down into the water. Underwater there are a couple of steps leading up to a change in level in the hall -- that's what the jet-ski grounded on. \nHALLWAY \nRay motors down the hallway toward the corner. \nRAY Kenny? \nHIS POV \nAround the corner comes a jet-ski. Ray assumes it's Kenny. \nRAY See him? \nThen the jet-ski speeds up and shoots by him. Ray sees it's... \nTOM \nWearing Kenny's hat and jacket. \nRAY \nGives chase. \nSCHOOL HALLWAYS \nRay races after Tom along the flooded hallways, taking the turns fast. Ray pulls a gun, starts shooting. \nTOM'S POV \nTearing through the halls, flashlight lighting the way. Bullets hit the walls, ceiling, water around him. \nTOM \nComes around a corner, sees the open front doors ahead of him. \nJIM AND MR. MEHLOR \nCome into view in the ski-boat, blocking the exit. \nTOM \nTurns hard and speeds down a side hall. \nTOM'S POV \nA wall of windows at the end. No way out. Trapped. Then... \nKENNY \nRises out of the water, blood running down his face, pistol up. \nTOM \nLooks back. \nRAY \nIs on his tail. \nTOM \nMakes his choice and guns the jet-ski straight at Kenny. \nTOM Yee-hah! \n", "test1_id": 3084, "test2_input": "Tom and Karen surface, catch their breath. Quiet for a few moments as they both look around to see that Jim and his men are gone. \nKAREN So what do we do? \nTOM I guess just drive around until we run out of gas. \nKAREN (pissed) Look, I've spent the last eight months of my life restoring that church, and I just left it to come save your ass, so spare me, okay? \nTOM (beat) When we get down here a little further we'll find a place for you to hide. (off her look) I'm gonna get back to the truck and wait for the National Guard. (checks watch) They should be there pretty soon. \nKaren nods. Tom looks at her. She's shivering. \nTOM Cold? \nKAREN No, I'm fine. The heater just kicked in. \nTom looks at her, gives a little grin. Their eyes meet for a second, then they look away. \nEXT. SHERIFF'S STATION \nPhil climbs up onto the roof, exhausted. He sees the hole in the roof and goes to look at it. As he's looking down... \nSHERIFF (O.S.) Is he dead? \nPhil turns to see... \nTHE SHERIFF AND WAYNE \nCoasting up in their boats. \nPHIL No. Someone got him out. \nSHERIFF Who? \nPHIL (hesitates) Maybe Karen. \nWAYNE Karen? How could she get him out? You took her out of town. \nPHIL I -- It -- \nSHERIFF Let's hear it, Phil. \nPHIL It happened real fast, okay? \nEXT. ALLEYWAY \nTom and Karen float down the alley in the car. \nKAREN You ever been robbed before? \nTOM No. The scariest thing that ever happened before was Charlie running out of donuts. (off her look) I've only been doing this for a couple months. \nKAREN (not what she wanted to hear) Oh. \nSilence for a few moments. \nKAREN What'd you do before this? \nTOM I, uh... I sold construction machinery. (off her look) I was making good money, it just... I don't know. It just didn't seem right for me anymore. \nKAREN How'd you end up in this? \nTOM My uncle did me a favor; got me in. \nKAREN Nice favor. How's he gonna feel after tonight? \nTOM My uncle was Charlie -- my partner in the truck. \nKAREN Oh, God. I'm sorry. \nTom nods -- so is he. \nEXT. SHERIFF'S STATION \nPhil climbs into the Sheriff's boat. \nWAYNE She know karate or something, Phil? Maybe kung fu? I mean, I can't see how else she could overpower the likes of you. \nPHIL Shut up, Wayne. \nSHERIFF Shut up, both of you. Let's go find Karen; see if she's got him. \nThe Sheriff fires up his engine and heads off, Wayne following. \nEXT. ALLEYWAY \nKaren and Tom are still in the car. They freeze at the sound of engines in the distance. The sounds fade. Tom looks around. \nTOM God, I wonder whose car this is. \nKaren plucks some cassette tapes out of the water. \nKAREN Well, whoever it is, he listens to Pat Benatar, Eddie Money and the soundtrack to \"Footloose.\" \nTOM Really? (looks at tapes) Hold on... (looks around car) ...I think this is my car from high school. \nKaren laughs. Just then... \nTHE CAR \nGets caught on something and stops. \nTOM Looks like we get out here. (Karen hesitates) Come on -- I told your father I'd have you home by ten. \nKaren grins. Just then... \nA TRANSFORMER \n", "test2_true": "TOM AND KAREN \nHear a sparking sound and look over to see... \nA TRANSFORMER \nOn a telephone/power pole close to them. Rain hits it, causing the sparking sound. The floodwater is inching up the pole toward it. \nThe water will reach the transformer in a matter of seconds. And while they're staring at that... \nANOTHER TRANSFORMER \nAt the end of the street explodes as water hits it. \nTOM AND KAREN \nLook around -- what to do? Tom points. \nTOM There! \nThey climb out of the car and start swimming toward a house. \nTHE TRANSFORMER \nWater is three inches from the transformer; two inches... \nTOM AND KAREN \nSwimming as hard as they can. \nTHE TRANSFORMER \nOne inch from the water... \nTOM AND KAREN \nReach the house. They pull themselves up onto a television antenna/ladder running up the side of the house. Karen's feet are still in the water. \nTOM Get your feet up! \nTHE TRANSFORMER \nThe water is about to touch. There's a sizzling sound. \nTOM AND KAREN \nThey heave a huge sigh of relief -- but then Tom realizes... \nTOM Oh, shit! \nKAREN What? \nTOM (re: antenna/ladder) It's metal! \nTom pushes Karen over onto a window ledge. Then, just as Tom's about to step over... \nKENNY \nComes screaming in on the jet-ski. He dives off the jetski, gets a hold of Tom and pulls him under. \nKENNY AND TOM \nSurface. Kenny is stronger and he has Tom in a tight grip. One problem -- Kenny doesn't know the danger they're in. \nTOM We've gotta --! \nKenny shoves Tom underwater. \nKENNY HEY! I GOT HIM! \nTom comes up, looks over at... \nTHE TRANSFORMER \nThe sizzling is getting louder. \nTOM We have to --! \nKenny dunks Tom again. \nKENNY I GOT HIM! \nUNDERWATER \nTom grabs Kenny's arms and pulls himself up fast. \nKENNY AND TOM \nTom's head comes out of the water and slams into Kenny's chin. Kenny is stunned. Tom gets free of his grasp. \nKAREN Hurry! \nTom does the backstroke, pulling hard toward Karen. \nKENNY \nStill stunned, finally hears the sizzling and looks over at... \nTHE TRANSFORMER \nThe water touches the outer casing of the transformer. \nKENNY \nStarts swimming fast toward... \nTOM AND KAREN \n", "test2_id": 3085, "test3_input": "THE WATER \nErupts in a huge geyser. \nTHE SHERIFF, WAYNE, PHIL AND HANK \nAre knocked off their feet. The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are thrown into the water. Their boats are rocked up and back and swamped with falling water. \nJIM \nFires up his engine. \nTOM \nIs almost to the boat. \nWAYNE \nGets to his knees in his boat and starts shooting. \nTOM \nGets to Jim's boat and grabs onto it. \nJIM \nCranks the throttle, and, dragging Tom, tears off under the hail of Wayne's bullets. \nTOM'S POV \nAs Jim races through the tombstones, barely missing halfsubmerged stone crosses and crypt roofs. \nTOM \nRams into one cross. \nHIS HANDS \nStart to slip from the boat. \nJIM \nGrabs Tom's hand and holds on as they shoot off across the water. \nTHE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK \nGet back in the boats. \nEXT. ON THE WATER - MOVING \nJim hauls Tom into the boat. Tom lays on the bottom, catching his breath. Blood is dripping down from his arm. \nTOM (beat, looks up at Jim) You really want that money? \nJim gives Tom a look -- of course he wants that money. \nTOM 'Cause the only way you're ever gonna see it is if you help me get Karen. \nBefore Jim can answer, gunshots ring out behind them. They look back to see... \nTHE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN \nComing after them in the three boats, shooting, closing. \nTOM We're too slow. \nJIM (thinks, then:) Here. \nJim moves away from the wheel, giving it to Tom. Tom gets up and takes over. Jim bends and picks up... \nKENNY \nLifeless and limp. \nJIM \nLooks at Kenny for a moment, then pushes his body overboard. \nWITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN \nFlying over the water. \nTHEIR POV \nThey see a body tumble out of the ski-boat. \nWITH JIM AND TOM \nJim looks back, following Kenny with his eyes. \nEXT. MAIN STREET \nJim and Tom make the turn onto Main Street. They look back as... \nTHE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN \nCome around the corner, two hundred yards back. \nTOM They're not going to catch us now. \nLOW ANGLE \nOf the ski-boat, racing toward camera.

Tom looks down. \nJIM \nIs laying on the deck, unconscious. Just then... BAM! BAM! BAM! \nHANK \nHas his rifle resting on his boat's windshield and is firing off a clip on automatic as he, Wayne and the Sheriff close in. \nTOM \nDucks down and tries to start the engine. No go. Again. It catches on the third try. Tom guns it and the boat tears off. \nTHE OUTBOARD ENGINE \nIs wobbling, vibrating. \nHANK \nKeeps up his stream of gunfire. \nTOM \nStays down, driving blind, as the bullets fly in, blowing holes in the windshield.

He sees Jim touch his head. \nTOM That hurt? \nJIM Yeah. \nTOM Good. \nEXT. MAIN STREET \nWayne and Hank are alongside the Sheriff, engines idling as they look at the church. \nSHERIFF (nods, to Hank) Then go get some bottles. \nHank nods, guns his engine. \nPHIL (to Hank) Wait -- what about the dam? \nSHERIFF It'll be fine. \nPHIL You said if it goes it'll wipe out the town. \nSHERIFF Fuck the town. \nHank nods in agreement and takes off. \nINT.

{"test1_input": "WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN \nThe Sheriff and Wayne reload. \nHANK (O.S.) Anyone mind telling me what the hell is going on? \nThe Sheriff, Wayne and Phil turn to see... \nHANK \nIn his boat, right behind them, all dressed up in hunting gear, rifle at the ready. \nSHERIFF Hey, Hank. That money I told you about? From the armored car? We're gonna keep it. Three million dollars. Four ways. (shoots at crypt) Seven fifty apiece. You okay with that? \nHank is stunned. He doesn't answer. \nSHERIFF Hank? You okay with that? \nHANK Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars? (beat, grins) Damn straight I'm okay with that. \nWAYNE (grumbling, re: Hank) Don't see what we needed him for. \nSHERIFF Then I guess you've never been hunting with Hank. (to Hank) We got two behind that crypt. Get 'em. \nHank nods. He motions for Wayne to go one way; he'll go the other. They start off. A blind shot comes from Jim behind the crypt. The Sheriff shoots back. Phil finally musters up the courage to say something. \nPHIL Maybe I'm not okay with it. \nSHERIFF Come on now, Phil. \nPHIL You're gonna kill people? \nSHERIFF They're looters, Phil! They come and steal from an armored truck in our town -- they're looters. (fires two shots) \nPHIL What about Tom? What about Karen? They're not looters. \nSHERIFF No, they're witnesses. \nThe Sheriff fires off a flurry of bullets. \nTOM AND JIM \nBehind the crypt, bullets winging by. Jim looks over, sees... \nHANK \nMotor into view. \nJIM \nOpens fire. \nHANK \nShoots back. \nTOM \nFlattens against the crypt, then turns to see... \nWAYNE \nComing into view on the other side. \nTOM \nLooks at Jim, sees he's occupied in the fight with Hank. Then he sees... \nRAY \nFloating in the water, dead, pistol still jammed in his pants. \nTOM \nThinks, decides, and reaches out for Ray. \nCLOSE ON JIM \nShooting at Hank. He hears gunfire from Wayne and is about to swivel to shoot in that direction when he hears a gun firing from right next to him. He turns to see... \nTOM \nShooting back at Wayne with Ray's gun. \nWAYNE \nPulls back out of the line of fire. \nHANK \nCurses and pulls back, too. \nTOM AND JIM \nExchange a look. \nTHE SHERIFF'S BOAT \nPHIL How can you do this? \nSHERIFF Jeez, Phil, I always thought Wayne was the stupid one. Read my lips. (slowly) Three million dollars. Look at it! \nThe Sheriff reaches down into a forward storage area of the boat and pulls back a tarp revealing the bags of money. \nSHERIFF A couple of those bags are gonna be yours, Phil. \nPHIL But -- but -- you're the Sheriff! \n", "test1_true": "SHERIFF I'm the what? \nTOM AND JIM \nJim looks at Tom, then hands Tom his pistol. Tom doesn't know what Jim's doing. Jim slips beneath the water. \nHANK \nWhistles and gets Wayne's attention. He motions Wayne to try it again. \nTHE SHERIFF'S BOAT \nPHIL For twenty years you've been -- \nSHERIFF For twenty years I've been eating shit, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Well, tonight I'm changing the menu! From now on everything I eat is gonna be shit-free! \nBEHIND THE CRYPT \nTom is looking for Jim, to see what he's doing. And then... \nWAYNE AND HANK \nCome around on both sides. \nTOM \nStarts shooting at them with the two pistols. \nWAYNE AND HANK \nPull back. As they go... \nTOM \nSees... \nKAREN'S ARM \nDraped over the side of Wayne's boat. \nTOM \nTakes another shot at Hank but stops firing at Wayne. \nCLOSE ON JIM'S SKI-BOAT \nJim's hand appears over the gunwale. He reaches in and grabs... \nMR. MEHLOR'S PACK \nAnd pulls it out of the boat. \nTHE SHERIFF'S BOAT \nSHERIFF Can I make it any clearer, Phil? Do you want me to draw pictures? \nPhil pulls out his revolver and points it at the Sheriff. \nPHIL I can't let you do it. \nSHERIFF Oh for -- (beat) Okay, Phil. But here's how it's gonna go. I'm gonna hear one of two things out of you. Either I'm gonna hear you say you're in with us, or... (moves close to Phil's gun) ...I'm gonna hear a bullet come out of that gun and go into me. \nPhil is incredulous. The Sheriff weighs his hands like scales. \nSHERIFF (one hand) Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars or... (other hand) ...you kill me. Your choice. \nThe Sheriff weighs the hands a couple more times. Phil slumps, lowers the gun. \nSHERIFF There we go. \nSOMETHING \nFlies through the air; lands in the water by the Sheriff. It's... \nMR. MEHLOR'S PACK \nAnd it starts sinking in the water. \nBEHIND THE CRYPT \nTom sees... \nJIM \nHaul himself into the ski-boat. \nWAYNE (O.S.) In the boat! \nTHE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK \nStart shooting at Jim in the ski-boat. \nJIM \nSticks the shotgun over the gunwale and returns fire. \nTOM \nStarts swimming for the boat. \nTHE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK \nSee Tom and start shooting at both he and Jim when... \nMR. MEHLOR'S PACK \nExplodes and... \n", "test1_id": 3084, "test2_input": "SHERIFF Yeah, you're right. \nThe Sheriff pushes Hank out of the boat. \nHANK \nGoes skipping over the water and slams into a streetlight post. \nINT. KAREN'S HOUSE \nTom swims down into the living room. His light shows a couch, chairs, TV set. Books and newspapers are suspended in the water. \nEXT. THE CHURCH \nThe damaged ski-boat that Jim and Tom took to the church has slipped off the sandbag wall and is drifting. A peaceful scene. But then, from the distance, comes a rushing roar. \nINT. CHURCH \nPhil hears the roar. He looks around, lost. \nEXT. STREET \nHank, groggy in the water, also hears the distant roar. \nINT. CHURCH \nThe roar is building, getting louder. Phil sees something in the water and reaches for it, frantically. He gets it. It's... \nA BIBLE \nAnd he clutches it to his chest as... \nTHE FLOOD \nHits the church. \nINT. KAREN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN \nTom swims into the kitchen. He looks for the tall cupboard by the fridge. He opens it. \nINSIDE THE CUPBOARD \nHanging on a hook on the back wall is a saw. Tom grabs it. \nEXT. MAIN STREET \nHank unwraps himself from around the lamp post. He looks back. \nHIS POV \nStreetlights in the distance, winking out one by one, marking the advance of the wall of water. \nHANK Oh my God. \nHank looks around for safety. He sees it. \nHIS POV \nThere's an alleyway. \nHANK \nSwims for the alley. \nEXT. THE ADVANCING FLOOD \nRoars through the town, pushing a rolling wave of debris, obliterating anything in its path. \nEXT. ALLEY \nHank swims into the alley. Hank looks for something to climb up on, to hold onto. There's... \nFIRE ESCAPE LADDER \nAt the end of the alley. \nHANK \nSwims for it. He hears the rushing roar of the advancing flood. He expects the flood to blow by the end of the alley. Wrong. \nWALL OF WATER \nComes into the alley, banking high on the far wall before coming down and barreling toward Hank. And what makes it worse for Hank is that there's... \nA CAR \nAt the front of the wave, being pushed by the water. \nHANK \nDives clear just as... \nTHE CAR \nSmashes into the wall, right where Hank had just been. \nHANK \nRelief in his eyes. He gets to the fire escape and is climbing to safety when... \nPROPANE TANK \nComes into the alley, rolling in the flood, spraying propane from a torn hose. It explodes. \nHANK \nBarely has time to scream. \n", "test2_true": "Tom is threading his belt through the handle of the saw to secure it. He gets it done and starts to swim out of the kitchen. \nBACK TO KAREN \nJust Karen's lips and nose are above water. \nIN THE KITCHEN \nTom is about to leave when everything starts to move -- rocking, from side to side, as if in a slow motion earthquake. Cupboards and the fridge open and bottles and food and plates tumble out. \nEXT. KAREN'S HOUSE \nThe house has been hit by the flood. It's being pulled by the massive current, stretching overhead phone and power lines. \nINT. KAREN'S HOUSE \nKaren hears the groaning, ripping as the house tears free from water and sewer lines. She's looking down for Tom when there's a snap and the light above her goes out. \nEXT. KAREN'S HOUSE \nThe house is carried on the current, turning in the water. \nIN THE KITCHEN \nTom watches, astounded, as the room starts to turn around him. He kicks fast for the door to... \nTHE LIVING ROOM \nTom swims in, fast, toward the stairs when... \nA WINDOW \nCaves in and... \nHUGE TREE BRANCH \nSmashes in, filling the room, blocking Tom's route to the stairs. \nTOM \nTries to get through the tangle of branches and leaves, but can't. He swims over to another window and slides it up. \nKAREN \nKeeps looking down for Tom. \nEXT. KAREN'S HOUSE \nThe house is impaled on a tree, the current sluicing around it. \nTOM \nSurfaces near the side of the house, gasping. The current starts ripping him past the house. He swims as hard as he can back to the house, reaches out and grabs onto a gutter. \nINT. KAREN'S HOUSE \nKaren doesn't have much time left. The water is washing over her mouth and nose. And just as she's about to go under... \nTOM \nSwims in with the saw. He starts sawing on the handrail. Everything's going fine. And then... \nTHE SAWBLADE \nSnaps. \nTOM AND KAREN \nLook at each other. Oh no. Karen's going under. \nTOM \nSees something. He dives into the water. \nKAREN \nCan only watch and wait. What's he doing? Oh, Jesus. And then... \nTOM \nSurfaces, holding Wayne's pistol. He puts the mouth of the barrel to the handcuff chain, shields Karen's face, looks away and pulls the trigger. \nEXT. A TREE IN WATER \nThe water swirls through the branches of a half-submerged tree. \nHENRY AND DOREEN \nAre in the tree. Henry is either unconscious or dead. Doreen cradles him. \nDOREEN Come on, Henry. Forget that \"Go to the light\" crap. Come back to me. You're all I've got. \nAnd Henry starts to come to. \nDOREEN Oh, Henry. Thank God. \nHenry opens his eyes. \nHENRY Next time, when I say \"Let's evacuate,\" we're gonna evacuate. \nDOREEN Whatever you say, honey. \nShe hugs him tight and after a beat he hugs her back. \nEXT. KAREN'S HOUSE \nTom and Karen swim out of a second floor window, grab the rain gutter. Tom pulls himself onto the roof then grabs Karen and helps her up. They crawl until they're clear of the edge. Only the sloped roof of the house is visible in the swirling water. They are just catching their breath when they are hit by... \n", "test2_id": 3085, "test3_input": "BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT \nAnd they look to see... \nTHE SHERIFF \nIn his boat, shining a searchlight on them with one hand, a gun in the other. He starts shooting. \nTOM AND KAREN \nTom pushes Karen toward the peak of the roof as the bullets plug in around them. Tom pushes Karen over the top then turns and dives off the roof and into the water. \nKAREN \nHears an engine behind her and turns. \nA BOAT \nRacing toward the house. It's... \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nAnd at the controls is... \nJIM \nBarely alive. \nTHE OUTBOARD MOTOR \nIs wobbling, vibrating at the back of the boat, almost loose from its moorings. \nJIM'S POV \nHe sees Karen, crouched below the peak of the house, a bright light coming from the other side along with gunshots. \nJIM \nPushes the throttle all the way forward. \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nShoots forward. \nUNDERWATER \nTom swims hard toward the Sheriff's boat. \nTHE SHERIFF \nIs shooting down into the water at Tom's moving shape. \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nWith Jim at the wheel, comes racing straight toward the house. \nKAREN \nThinks he's going to turn. \nKAREN No! No! \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nDoesn't turn. \nKAREN \nRolls to the side, just getting clear as... \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nHits the sloping roof of Karen's house and ramps up it. \nTHE OUTBOARD MOTOR \nDigs into the shingles of the roof and tears free from the back of the boat. \nTHE SHERIFF \nHears the sound and looks up as... \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nComes over the peak of the roof. \nTOM \nSurfaces to see... \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nFly right over him, heading straight for... \nTHE SHERIFF \nWho ducks down, just in time as... \nTHE SKI-BOAT \nMisses him, landing just past him in the water. \nTHE SHERIFF \nStraightens up, grinning with glee that the boat missed him. And then he hears a piercing whine coming from behind him. He turns, just in time to see... \nTHE OUTBOARD MOTOR \n", "test3_true": "THE SHERIFF \nStarts to scream. \nCLOSE ON KAREN \nLooking over the peak of the roof in horror. She hears the Sheriff's scream and the scream of the propeller and then a horrible ugly ripping and both screams stop. \nTHE SHERIFF'S BOAT \nThe Sheriff is gone. The side has been smashed out of the boat and the boat is flooding with water. \nTHE SHERIFF \nIs just some misshapen thing trailing red, floating in the water. \nJIM \nTries to restart the ski-boat but it's dead. He slumps forward. \nTOM \nSees Jim slump against the side of the boat. \nTOM You okay? \nJIM Fine. \nTom can tell Jim's anything but. Tom swims for the boat. \nTHE BOAT \nTom swims up, pulls himself in. He pulls Jim back off the controls, sees the blood. \nTOM Oh, God. We gotta get you to -- \nJim looks at Tom. Tom understands -- Jim's not going anywhere. \nTOM Thanks. \nJIM For what? \nTOM You just saved our lives. \nJIM I did? I just came for the money. \nTom looks at Jim -- he knows Jim's lying. \nKAREN (O.S.) Do you need any help? \nJIM (grabs Tom's arm) No. Tell her to stay back. \nTOM (to Karen) It's okay! \nJim lets go of Tom. \nJIM You're going to turn it in? \nTOM Sorry to disappoint you. \nJIM Well, hell, then I guess I better take it after all. I figure the river'll carry me down to the Gulf of Mexico. If I catch the right currents, maybe I'll end up in... Belize? (Tom nods) You come look me up. I'll buy you a drink. \nTOM I'll do that. \nJim grimaces as he's hit by a wave of pain. He looks away. \nJIM Go. \nTom hesitates for a second. \nJIM Please. \nTom turns and slides into the water and swims away. \nJIM Son, don't think too badly of your Uncle Charlie. He always said you were capable of remarkable things. (beat) He was right. \nThere's a last look between Jim and Tom, then Tom swims away. \nJIM (smiles) The rain's stopped. (breathes deep) The air after a rain... \nJim slowly topples forward and is still. \nTOM \nSwims through the swirling current toward Karen's roof. \nJIM'S BOAT \nSinks below the surface and is gone. \nTOM AND KAREN \nKaren is down at the water's edge with her arm extended to Tom. Tom grabs it, and as Karen pulls... \nMATCH CUT TO: \nEXT. CHURCH - SUNSET \nKaren pulls Tom up onto scaffolding running along the edge of the new roof under construction. Tom holds a paper bag. He's wearing work gear -- tool belt, work boots, etc. Tom looks at the work being done on the roof. \nTOM They got a lot done today. \nKAREN It's coming along. (re: bag) What'd you get? \nTOM Barbecue chicken from Lilly's. \nKAREN Yum. \n", "test3_id": 3086}

{"test1_input": "JACK (V.O.) It was right in everyone's face. Tyler and I just made it visible. \nIrvine hits a button and the JUKEBOX loses power.  Members of the waiting army begins to share secret looks.  Finally, one buy locks the door.  Two other guys close the blinds. \nJACK (V.O.) It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.  Tyler and I just gave it a name. \nINT. TAVERN BASEMENT - SAME \nA BOMB-SHELTER.  Concrete walls.  One BARE BULB above, Tyler standing directly beneath it. \nTYLER Welcome to fight club. \nThe guys mill around, finding partners.  Everyone brims with eagerness, but tries to act cool.  CHATTER gets LOUDER. Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, Tyler at center. \nJACK (V.O.) Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided. \nPEAKING CHATTER, till Tyler raises his arms and the CHATTER DIES.  A couple of COUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING, then, SILENCE. \nTYLER The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.  The second rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.  The third rule of fight club is -- when someone says \"stop\" or goes limp, the fight is over.  Fourth rule is -- only two guys to a fight.  Fifth rule -- one fight at a time.  Sixth rule -- no shirts, no shoes.  Seventh rule -- fights go on as long as they have to.  And the eighth and final rule -- if this is your first night at fight club, you have to fight. \nTyler steps back.  A short guy, RICKY, and a GOATEED MAN take off shirts and shoes and step to the center. \nJACK (V.O.) This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk -- couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black ink ... \nThe two fighters circle, then begin throwing PUNCHES... \nJACK (V.O.) But Ricky was a god for ten minutes last week when he trounced an actuary twice his size. \nHarder, faster PUNCHES between the two.  SWEAT flies. SHOUTS become DEAFENING.  Ricky's getting the best of Goateed Man, POUNDING him... \nJACK (V.O.) Sometimes all you could hear were flat, hard packing sounds over the yelling, or the wet choke when someone caught their breath and sprayed... \nGOATEED MAN (spittle-lipped) Ssssstop... ! \nINT. OFFICE PARK RESTAURANT - DAY \nJack, eating lunch, watches the BROKEN-NOSED WAITER with a GOATEE -- from the above fight -- converse with a MAITRE D'. \nJACK (V.O.) Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight, I wouldn't be talking to the same man. \nThe Goateed Waiter approaches Jack and sets a refill soda down on the table.  The two of them briefly make eye contact. \nJACK (V.O.) Who you were in fight club is not who you were in the rest of the world. \nINT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY \nJack stands over a copy machine, hit by flashes of light. He glances over his shoulder, watches Ricky, wearing an apron, push a supply cart.  Ricks nods at Jack. \nJACK (V.O.) You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.  But fight club only exists in the hours between when fight club starts and when fight club ends. \nINT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY \nJack, playing SOLITAIRE on his computer, daubs blood from his mouth with a handkerchief.  Boss, passing by the doorway, looks in at Jack, irritated. \nBOSS What are you getting yourself into every week? \nJack keeps playing Solitaire.  Boss enters, folds his arms. \nJACK (V.O.) After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything. \nBOSS Have you finished those reports? \nJACK (handing him reports) Yes. \nJACK (V.O.) The people who had power over you have less and less. \nJack looks at Boss.  Reflexively, Jack's tongue plays with his teeth. \nJACK (V.O.) By this point, I could wiggle most of the teeth in my jaw. \nEXT. STREET - DUSK \nTyler and Jack walk, both smoking cigarettes. \nJACK (V.O.) A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood. \nJACK If you could fight any celebrity? \nTYLER Alive or dead? \nJACK Doesn't matter. \nTYLER Hemingway.  You? \nJACK Shatner.  William Shatner. \nThey reach a BUS STOP as a BUS arrives, tossing their cigarettes, getting on board... \nINT. BUS - DUSK \nThe bus is crowded.  As Tyler and Jack walk toward the back, Jack studies the faces of OTHER PASSENGERS... \nJACK (V.O.) We all started seeing things differently.  Wherever we went. \nThey hold hand grips.  Jack looks up at an ADVERTISEMENT; a CALVIN KLEIN ad featuring a tan, bare-chested MUSCLE STUD. \nJACK (V.O.) I felt sorry for all the guys packing into gyms, trying to look like what Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said they should. \nTyler looks at Jack, looks at the C.K. advertisement. \nTYLER Self-improvement is masturbation. Self-destruction is the answer. \nA MAN in a suit KNOCKS Tyler's shoulder as he passes.  The Man takes a handle, close by.  Jack's pissed, staring at the man, who stares back. \nJACK (to Tyler, so the Man can hear) You could take him. \nTyler looks to Jack, glances over his shoulder at the Man. Tyler casually picks a small scab off Jack's nostril. \nTYLER The trick is not to care. \nTyler stares forward. \nINT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT \nTyler HITS the floor, stomach first.  HIS OPPONENT lands on top of him, grappling, trying for a CHOKE HOLD.  The surrounding CROWD, Jack included, SCREAMS at them... \nTyler and the Opponent wrestle desperately, and Tyler flips his attacker, gets on top, sprawling to pin him.  Tyler turns -- starts reining PUNCHES into the Opponent's GROIN... \n", "test1_true": "Jack lands a couple of BLOWS to HIS OPPONENT'S stomach -- brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw. Tiny spatters of BLOOD adorn the walls, along with sweat. \nJack catches sight of a swollen-faced Tyler, watching appreciatively, a smile growing slowly on his face. \nJACK (V.O.) Fight club wasn't about winning or losing.  It wasn't about words. \nThe Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack.  Jack snakes his arm into a counter headlock.  They wrestle like wild animals.  The crowd CHEERS maniacally. \nJACK (V.O.) They hysterical shouting was in tongues, like at a Pentecostal church. \nOnlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering LOUDER. The Opponent SMASHES Jack's head to the floor, over and over. \nJACK ... stop... \nJACK (V.O.) When the fight was over, nothing was solved, but nothing mattered. \nEveryone moves in as the Opponent steps away.  Tyler pushes through the crowd.  Others lift Jack up.  They turn their attention to the floor, to a BLOOD MASK of Jack's face -- similar to the TEAR MASK on BOB'S SHIRT. \nTYLER Cool. \nJack limply shakes his Opponent's hand. \nOPPONENT How about next week? \nJACK Look at me.  How about next month? \nEveryone helps Jack walk.  He's sweating, bleeding, smiling. \nJACK (V.O.) Afterwards, we all felt saved. \nINT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT \nA NURSE tends to Jack while Tyler watches. \nTYLER He fell down some stairs. \nThe Nurse doesn't look at Tyler, just keeps tending to Jack. \nJACK I fell down some stairs. \nJACK (V.O.) Sometimes Tyler spoke for me. \nINT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING \nTyler and Jack share the cracked MIRROR.  Tyler's clipping at his hair with blunt, ill-suited SCISSORS.  Jack's brushing his teeth, spitting out pink foam. \nJACK (V.O.) Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails. \nTYLER Any historical figure. \nJACK Okay... Ghandi. \nTYLER Good answer. \nJACK You? \nTYLER Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger. \nJack reaches in his mouth, exploring, pulls -- yanks a TOOTH.  Jack looks at it.  Tyler puts scissors down, done. \nTYLER Remember, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart. \nJack drops the tooth in the sink with Tyler's hair. \nINT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON \nJack enters, buttoning his shirt.  The PHONE RINGS. \nJACK Hello? \nINTERCUT WITH... \nINT. MARLA'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - SAME \nMarla's in the HALL, on the PAYPHONE, twisting the phone cord around her neck. \nMARLA Where have you been the last few weeks? \nJACK Marla? \nJack looks through the archway and sees Tyler, in his gummy flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups.  Jack leans, cups the phone. \nJACK (quietly) How did you find me? \nMARLA The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups. \nJACK That's the idea -- we split them. \nMARLA You haven't been going to yours. \nJACK I found a new one. \nMARLA Really? \nJACK It's for men. \nMARLA Like testicular cancer? \nJACK Look, this is a bad time... \nMARLA I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people? \nJACK I'm just on my way out... \nMARLA Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much. \nJack looks exasperated, turns TO LOOK INTO THE CAMERA. \nJACK (V.O.) Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment. \nMARLA This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things. \nJACK (V.O.) This could go on for hours. \nJACK So you're staying in tonight? \n", "test1_id": 366, "test2_input": "TYLER The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes.  Like the first monkeys shot into space. \nThe saliva shines in the shape of the kiss.  Tyler pours a bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand. \nTYLER Without sacrifice, without death, we would have nothing. \nJack's whole body JERKS.  Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand and arm.  Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens. \nTYLER This is a chemical burn.  It will hurt more than you've ever been burned and you will have a scar. \nJack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of Tyler's kiss.  Jack's face spasms. \nJACK (V.O.) Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand. \nTYLER Look at your hand. \nJACK (V.O.) Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this. \nSHOT OF A GREEN MAPLE LEAF, GLISTENING WITH DEW.  RESUME: \nTyler looks at Jack's glazed and detached eyes. \nTYLER Come back to the pain.  Don't shut this out. \nJack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away.  Tyler keeps hold of it and their arms KNOCK UTENSILS off the table. \nJACK (V.O.) I tried not to think of the words \"searing\" or \"flesh.\"  I imagined my pain as a ball of healing white light. \nSHOT OF A FOREST, IN GENTLE SPRING RAINFALL.  RESUME: \nTyler JERKS Jack's hand, getting Jack's attention... \nTYLER Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it. \nJACK (V.O.) I was going to my cave to find my power animal. \nSHOT OF THE INSIDE OF JACK'S FROZEN ICE CAVE.  RESUME: \nTyler JERKS Jack's hand again.  Jack re-focuses on Tyler... \nTYLER Don't deal with this the way those dead people do.  Deal with it the way a living person does. \nSHOT OF INSIDE THE ICE CAVE - ON MARLA, LYING NAKED UNDER A FUR COAT, TURNING HER HEAD TO LOOK TOWARDS US.  RESUME: \nJack tries to pull his hand free.  Tyler won't let go. Jack's eyes glaze over again.  Jack speaks, whiny from pain: \nJACK I... I think I understand.  I think I get it... \nTYLER No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment. \nSHOT OF A GREEN FOREST WITHOUT RAIN.  RESUME: \nTyler SLAPS Jack's face, regaining his attention... \nTYLER This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it. \nJACK No, I'm not... \nSHOT OF TREES ENGULFED BY A FOREST FIRE.  RESUME: \nTYLER Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God? \nJACK I don't know... \nSHOT OF EMBERS POURING FROM THE HELLISH FOREST FIRE.  RESUME: \nTyler SLAPS Jack's face again... \nTYLER Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen... \nJACK It isn't... ? \nTYLER We don't need him... \nJACK We don't... ? \nSHOT OF INSIDE ICE CAVE - NAKED MARLA PULLS JACK DOWN ON TOP OF HER - JACK KISSES HER - CIGARETTE SMOKE COMES FROM HER MOUTH - JACK COUGHS.  RESUME: \nJack is a wide-eyed zombie... \nJACK ... Marla ... ? \nTYLER Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it. \nJack looks at Tyler -- they lock eyes.  Jack does his best to stifle his spasms of pain, his body a quivering, coiled knot.  He bolts toward the sink, but Tyler holds on. \nTYLER You can go to the sink and run water over your hand.  Look at me.  Or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn, but first you have to give up. First, you have to know that someday, you are going to die.  Until you know that, you will be useless. \nJack spasms with a shiver of pain... \nJACK You ... you don't know what this feels like, Tyler. \nTyler shows Jack a LYE-BURNED KISS SCAR on his own hand. Tears begin to drip from Jack's eyes.  Tyler grabs a bottle of VINEGAR -- pours it over Jack's wound. \nJack closes his eyes, holds his hand... slumps to the floor. \nTYLER Congratulations.  You're a step closer to hitting bottom. \nINT. BARNEY'S - DAY \nJack and Tyler, in trench coats, looking like deaht-warmed- over, wait as a BUYER fills out forms. \nThere are bars of \"The Paper Street Soap Company\" soap on the counter.  Jack looks like he's half-expecting to get arrested.  His hand is BANDAGED. \nJACK (V.O.) Tyler sold the soap to department stores at twenty bucks a Ear.  God knows what they charged.  How ironic. We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them. \nINT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY \nJack sits at his desk, playing a game on his computer, smoking a cigarette.  Boss enters. \nJACK (V.O.) He was wearing a yellow tie.  It must be Thursday.  I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore. \nBoss slaps a piece of PAPER down on Jack's desk. \nBOSS \"The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club.\" \nJack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray, stares up stoically. \n", "test2_true": "BOSS \"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours? \nJACK Hmm? \nBOSS You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine. \nJACK \"Abuse\" the copy machine.  There's an image. \nBOSS Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do? \nJack rises slowly, walks to his door, shuts it. \nJACK Me? I'd be very careful who I talked to about this.  It sounds like someone dangerous wrote it... someone who might snap at any moment, stalking from office to office with an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round after round into colleagues and co- workers. \nJack moves very close to Boss, picks up the PAPER and starts tearing it into pieces. \nJACK Might be someone you've known for years... somebody very close to you. Or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing me every little piece of trash you pick up. \nJack puts the PAPER in his trash.  Bass stares with a tinge of outrage, a tinge of fear.  PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it. \nJACK Compliance and Liability. \nMARLA'S VOICE My tit's going to rot off. \nJACK Just a second. (to Boss; smiles) Could you excuse me?  I need to take this call. \nBoss goes to the door, stares at Jack a beat, then leaves. \nJACK (into phone) What are you talking about? \nINTERCUT WITH - CLOSE UP OF MARLA... \nMARLA Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor. \nJACK I don't know ... \nMARLA Please. \nJACK (V.O.) She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral in her book. \nEXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET \nJack walks down the sidewalk, seeing Marla take two BOXES from a VAN with the sign \"MEALS ON WHEELS.\" \nINT. MARLA'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nMarla leads Jack inside. \nJACK This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ... (reads the boxes:) \"Mrs. Haniver\" and... \"Mrs. Raines.\" Where are they? \nMARLA Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any? \nJACK No, thanks. \nMARLA Good. \nHe stares at her while she eats. \nMARLA What happened to your hand? \nJack awkwardly puts his bandaged hand behind his back. \nJACK Nothing. \nINT. MARLA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nMarla stands facing a MIRROR with her shirt open.  Jack stands behind her with his hand on the bottom side of her breast.  Marla's hand guides his. \nJACK Where?  Here? \nMARLA Here. \nJACK There? \nMARLA Here. \nJACK Here. \nMARLA Feel anything? \nJACK No. \nJack's head is behind Marla's.  They speak softer, slower. \nMARLA Make sure. \nJACK Okay.  Okay, I'm sure. \nMARLA You feel nothing? \nJACK Nothing. \nMarla turns around and faces him, begins to button her shirt. \nMARLA Well, that's a relief.  Thank you. \nJACK No... no problem. \nMARLA I wish I could return the favor. \nJack touches his own chest, shakes his head. \nJACK I think everything's okay here. \nMARLA I could check your prostate. \nJACK Uh ... nah. \nMARLA (pause) Well... thanks, anyway. \nMarla leans to kiss him -- lingers for a bit longer than just friendly.  Jack pulls away. \nJACK So.... are we done? \nMarla sighs. \n", "test2_id": 367, "test3_input": "INT. JACK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAt the window, Tyler sips coffee, watches this scene on the PORCH below. \nJACK (V.O.) Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be. \nEXT. PORCH - MORNING \nRicky's there.  Bob is now next to him, in black, with a paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet.  Tyler steps out. Jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob.  To all the following questions, Ricky answers \"Sir!\" -- \nTYLER You have two black shirts?  Two pair black trousers?  One pair black boots?  Two pair black socks?  One black coat?  Three hundred dollars personal burial money?  Go inside. \nRicky goes in.  Tyler turns to Bob. \nTYLER You're too old.  Sorry.  And, you're too fat.  Nice seeing you. \nBob looks genuinely hurt.  He picks up his mattress and starts away.  Tyler looks at Jack and rolls his eyes.  Jack follows Bob... \nJACK Bob... Bob, wait... (leading Bob back) Let me explain this to you... \nEXT. PORCH -- NIGHT \nCRICKETS CHIRP.  Bob stands at at rigid attention. \nINT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT \nTyler and Jack stand in bathroom doorway, watching Ricky finish SHAVING off all of his HAIR.  Tyler comes to give the top of Ricky's head a sharp SLAP. \nTYLER A monkey, ready to be shot into space.  A Space Monkey, ready to sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem. \nFrom here on, all those with shaved heads: \"SPACE MONKEYS.\" \nEXT. PORCH - DAY \nJack looks out the window.  Bob stands motionless.  There's another \"applicant,\" a SHORT GUY, beside Bob.  Ricky comes out the front door with the BROOM... \nRICKY (to Bob) You're too fucking old, fatty!  We don't want your kind here! (to short guy) You're too short.  Go away, stumpy! Go back to the circus! \nRicky HITS them with the broom, then goes in, SLAMS THE DOOR. \nJACK (V.O.) So it went... \nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY \nTyler works with a HALF DOZEN SPACE MONKEYS, preparing the square of backyard.  They pull weeds, clear rocks; working with shovels, rakes, etc.  They cart away WHEELBARROWS of rocks and carry in SACKS of FERTILIZER. \nJACK (V.O.) Tyler built his army. \nIN THE KITCHEN WINDOW, Jack watches... \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nJack keeps watching out the window, eats toast. \nJACK (V.O.) To what purpose, might one ask? Well, one might ask, if not for the first rule of Project Mayhem. \nJack turns to look around the kitchen.  THREE SPACE MONKEYS work -- one SCRUBBING the FLOOR, one WASHING DISHES, one SCRUBBING the walls.  Jack walks out. \nJACK (V.O.) In Tyler We Trust. \nINT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY \nJack opens his eyes, awakening to sunlight thru the window. \nJACK (V.O.) And, then... \nINT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY \nJack slowly pushes open the door to Tyler's room... \nJACK Tyler... \nThe room is empty.  Jack stares. \nJACK (V.O.) He was gone. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nJack comes downstairs... finds DOZENS of SPACE MONKEYS. \nINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT \nJack enters.  Space Monkeys render fat and make soap.  They pinch HERBS, adding them to the mix.  They add VODKA.  Off to the side, a couple Monkeys stir a vat of RICE.  On the wall is a big bulletin board with HUNDREDS of DRIVER's LICENSES; a sign above it: \"HUMAN SACRIFICES.\" \nFRECKLED SPACE MONKEY \"You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.  You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else. We are all part of the same compost heap.\" \nJACK (V.O.) Planet Tyler. \nJack dips a spoon into the rice, chomps on it irritatingly. \nFRECKLED SPACE MONKEY \"We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.\" \nJack picks up a BOTTLE of VODKA. \nJACK (V.O.) I had to hug the walls, trapped inside this clockwork of Space Monkeys, cooking and working and sleeping in teams. \nINT. READING ROOM - NIGHT \nJack enters, vodka in hand.  TEN SPACE MONKEYS here, reading. \nJACK (V.O.) The house became a living thing, wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.  So many people moving, the house moved. \nJack walks out. \nINT. OFFICE - DAY \nJack enters.  Angel Face reads a book, marks on a chart. Space Monkeys shuffle PAPERS and NEWS CLIPPINGS.  Walls are lined with FILES, each labeled with a STREET ADDRESS, under SIGNS: \"Mischief,\" \"Disinformation,\" \"Arson.\" \nJack's eye lingers on \"Arson.\" He starts flipping through a file.  Angel Face comes to take the file from him. \nANGEL FACE That wouldn't interest you. \nJACK Where's Tyler? \nANGEL FACE The first rule of Project -- \nJACK Right, right. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT \nJack takes a swig of vodka, smokes.  In the BACKGROUND, a Space Monkey WHACKS an APPLICANT with a BROOM.  It's a ritual; no words.  Other Space Monkeys tend the garden. \nJACK (V.O.) I'm all alone.  I Am Jack's Broken Heart. \nJack drops his cigarette in the gravel, steps on it.  A Space Monkey immediately comes to clean it up. \nJACK Get away from me! \nMARLA'S VOICE (O.S.) Who are all these people? \nJack turns, sees Marla with an overnight bag. \nJACK The Paper Street Soap Company. \nMARLA Can I come in? \nJACK He's not here. \nMARLA What? \nJACK He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away! \nMarla stares at Jack, miserable.  A tear runs down her cheek.  She turns and walks away.  Jack watches her go. There's a LOUD COMMOTION from the house, VOICES SHOUTING. Jack heads to the back door... \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nJack enters.  Ricky crawls, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the LEG.  Space Monkeys begin a rudimentary job of treating the wound.  Other Space Monkeys carry in a DEAD BODY in BLACK CLOTHES and SKI MASK, putting it on the table. \nJACK What's going on? \nSpace Monkeys stare at the body.  The Mechanic, sweating, gets to his knees and pulls the ski mask off the corpse -- it's BOB, with a gunshot wound to the HEAD. \nJACK Bob... oh, Christ... \nJack pushes past a Space Monkey, stares down, stricken... \nJACK What... what happened... ? \nMECHANIC (out of breath) We were on assignment... \nEXT. SCULPTURE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nA SCULPTURE adorned with a giant GLOBE on top. \nMECHANIC (V.O.) We were supposed to kill two birds with one stone: \nA SERIES of EXPLOSIONS blasts the GLOBE free.  It ROLLS... \nMECHANIC (V.O.) A piece of corporate art... \nThe GLOBE ROLLS downhill, to the street -- rolling over one parked LUXURY CAR after another, crunching car roofs and causing windows to explode... \nMECHANIC (V.O.) ... and trash a trendy coffee bar. \nThen, the GLOBE arrives at the lobby of a HOTEL... BROADSIDES a limo, RICOCHETS... ROLLS directly into the front of a closed ARROSTO coffee bar, SMASHING windows... DECIMATING coffee push-pats... \nEXT. PARK - AERIAL VIEW - (FLASHBACK CONTINUOUS) \nBob, the Mechanic and Ricky FLEE, LAUGHING at their handiwork.  They split up, running O.S. \nMECHANIC (V.O.) We had it all worked out, man.

KITCHEN - NIGHT - (RESUMING) \nThe Mechanic looks up from Bob's corpse. \nMECHANIC They shot Bob... they shot him in the head.  Those fuckers... \nJack walks away from Bob's corpse, distraught, holds his head, turns to look back, his eyes filling with tears. \nANOTHER SPACE MONKEY We gotta do something. \nRICKY We got to get rid of the evidence. We have to get rid of this body. \nANGEL FACE Bury him... \nJack looks around in disbelief. \nJACK What... ? \nANGEL FACE The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this! \nSeveral Space Monkeys gather around Bob's body. \nJACK No... ! \nSpace Monkeys stop.

Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want? (wipes tears, points at Bob) This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine... \nRICKY But, this is Project Mayhem. \nJACK No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name... \nRICKY But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names. \nJACK No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson. \nRICKY Robert Paulson? \n", "test3_id": 368}

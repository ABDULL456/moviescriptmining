{"train": "JACK (V.O.) I found freedom.  Losing all hope was freedom. \nJack pulls away from Bob.  On Bob's chest, there's a WET MASK of Jack's face from how he looks weeping. \nJACK (V.O.) Babies don't sleep this well. \nINT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJack lies sound asleep. \nJACK (V.O.) I became addicted. \nINT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT \nJack moves into a \"group hug\" of sickly people, men and women.  In view is a sign by the door \"Free and Clear.\" \nINT. OFFICE BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHT \nJack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN.  He begins to cry along with her.  A sign by the door: \"Onward and Upward.\" \nJACK (V.O.) If I didn't say anything, people assumed the worst.  They cried harder.  I cried harder. \nINT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT \nEveryone, including Jack, sits back in their seats, EYES CLOSED.  The Leader speaks into a microphone. \nLEADER Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra... \nJACK (V.O.) I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around. \nLEADER ...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light. \nJack, eyes closed, is silent... \nLEADER It moves over your body, healing you. Keep this going and step forward, through the back door of the room. Where does it lead?  To your cave. Step forward into your cave. \nINT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION \nJack walks along, moving through an ICE CAVERN... \nLEADER'S VOICE That's right.  You're going deeper into your cave.  And you're going to find your power animal... \nJack comes upon a PENGUIN.  The penguin looks at him, cocks his head to signal Jack forward. \nPENGUIN Slide. \nThe penguin jumps onto a patch of ICE and slides away. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nJack walks out a doorway, saying goodbye to people.  He walks down the sidewalk, shining with peace. \nJACK (V.O.) Every evening I died and every evening I was born again.  Resurrected. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - RESUMING \nJack's still in an embrace with Bob. \nJACK (V.O.) Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too.  Being there, my face against his tits, ready to cry -- this was my vacation. \nMARLA SINGER enters.  She has short matte black hair and big, dark eyes like a character from japanese animation. \nJACK (V.O.) And, she ruined everything. \nMarla looks around, raises a cigarette to her lips. \nMARLA This is cancer, right? \nBob and Jack stare, dumbfounded. \nINT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - LATER \nEveryone paired-off.  MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND JACK'S FACE as he stares... MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND MARLA'S FACE. She's drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette. \nJACK (V.O.) This ... chick ... Marla Singer ... did not have testicular cancer.  She was a liar. \nINT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT \nMarla sits with the group, smoking, listening intently while a member speaks.  Jack spies on her. \nJACK (V.O.) She had no diseases at all.  I had seen her at my melanoma Monday night group ... \nINT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHT \nMarla sits at the end of a row, smoking.  All the faces down the row are turned toward her, incredulous... \nJACK (V.O.) ... and at \"Free and Clear,\" my blood parasites group Thursdays. \nJack leans out further than the others, scornful. \nJACK (V.O.) -- And, again, at \"Seize The Day,\" my tuberculosis Friday night. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT \nJack watches... Marla's eyes are closed, her head on the shoulder of the MAN she's embraced by.  She opens her eyes, catching Jack's stare.  Jack looks away. \nJACK (V.O.) Marla -- the big tourist.  Her lie reflected my lie. \nMarla rests her chin on the man's shoulder.  Tears roll down her cheeks.  She wipes at them. \nEXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT \nMarla walks out,  The support group's dispersing.  Jack exits amongst them.  He spots Marla walking away. \nJACK (V.O.) And suddenly, I felt nothing.  I couldn't cry.  So, once again, I could not sleep. \nJack stares after Marla for a long moment.  He walks away. \nINT. BEDROOM - LATER \nJack, in underwear, is cross-legged on the floor, assembling IKEA furniture, CORDLESS PHONE shouldered to his ear. \nJACK (into phone) No, I just can't believe that card is declined -- Okay, okay, let me give you a different card number. \nMarla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were crying.  Jack pulls her head back up.  She deadpans at him. \nJACK Why are you doing this? \nMARLA It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee. \nJACK These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year. \nMARLA A year?  How'd you manage that? \nJACK Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back. \nLEADER Let yourself cry. \nMARLA Why do you do it? \nJACK I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead... \nMARLA -- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak. \nJACK Yeah. \nBrief recognition between them, broken as the Leader passes. \nLEADER Quietly, now.  Share with each other. \nJack waits till the Leader's out of earshot. \nJACK (warning) It becomes an addiction. \nMARLA Really? \nJack sighs, then pulls back. \nJACK Look, I can't cry with a faker present. \nMARLA Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem. \nJACK Please.  Can't we do something... ? \nMarla starts out of the room.  Jack follows her. \nLEADER Now, the closing prayer. \nEXT. CHURCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \nMarla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along. \nJACK We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and -- \nMARLA You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all. \nJACK I think testicular cancer should be no contest. \nMARLA Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls. \nJACK You're kidding. \nMARLA I don't know -- am I? \nJack follow Marla into... \nINT. LAUNDROMAT - CONTINUOUS \nMarla walks with authority up to an unwatched DRYER.  She takes out clothes, picks out jeans, pants and shirts. \nMARLA I'll take the parasites. \nJACK You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites -- \nMARLA I want brain parasites. \nJACK Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia -- \nMARLA I want that. \nJACK You can't have the whole brain! \nMARLA So far, you have four and I only have two! \nJACK Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three. \nMarla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past Jack... \nEXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS \nJack follows, bewildered. \nJACK You... left half your clothes. \nHONK!  Jack starts.  Marla's led him into the street with traffic barreling down. \nMarla walks on, oblivious as CARS screech to a halt, HORNS BLARING.  Jack dashes, following... \nINT. THRIFT STORE - CONTINUOUS \nMarla drops the pile of clothes on a counter.  An old CLERK sifts through the clothes, begins writing on a pad. \nJACK You're selling those? \nMarla steps down hard on Jack's foot.  He winces in pain. \nMARLA (for the Clerk to hear) Yes, I'm selling some chothes. \nThe Clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts. \nMARLA So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer. \nJACK (V.O.) The girl had done her homework. \nJACK I want ascending bowel cancer. \nThe Clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to Marla. \nMARLA That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh? \nJACK We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month. \nA giant corrugated METAL DOOR opens. \nJACK (V.O.) On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero. \nTwo TECHNICIANS lead Jack to the BURNT-OUT SHELL of a WRECKED AUTOMOBILE.  Jack sets down his briefcase, opens it and starts to make notes on a CLIPBOARDED FORM. \nJACK (V.O.) I'm a recall coordinator.  My job is to apply the formula.  It's a story problem. \nTECHNICIAN #1 Here's where the infant went through the windshield.  Three points. \nJACK (V.O.) A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60 miles per hour.  The rear differential locks up. \nTECHNICIAN #2 The teenager's braces around the backseat ashtray would make a good \"anti-smoking\" ad. \nJACK (V.O.) The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.  Now: do we initiate a recall? \nTECHNICIAN #1 The father must've been huge.  See how the fat burnt into the driver's seat with his polyester shirt?  Very \"modern art.\" \nJACK (V.O.) Take the number of vehicles in the field, (A), and multiply it by the probable rate of failure, (B), then multiply the result by the average out-of-court settlement, (C).  A times B times C equals X... \nCUT TO: \nINT. AIRPLANE CABIN - MOVING DOWN RUNWAY \nJack is speaking to the BUSINESSWOMAN next to him. \nJACK If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one. \nBUSISNESS WOMAN Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents? \nJACK Oh, you wouldn't believe. \nBUSINESS WOMAN ... Which... car company do you work for? \nJACK A major one. \nTurgid silence.  Jack turns to the window.  He sees a PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE. \nJACK (V.O.) Every time the plane banked too sharply on take-off or landing, I prayed for a crash, or a mid-air collision -- anything. \nJack's face remains bland during the following: the plane BUCKLES -- the cabin wobbles.  People panic.  Masks drop. \nJACK (V.O.) No more haircuts.  Nothing matters, not even bad breath. \nThe side of the plane SHEARS OFF!  Screaming PASSENGERS are sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering wind.  Magazines and other objects fly everywhere. \nJACK (V.O.) Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip. \nJack remains in his same position, same bland expression. \nDING! -- the seatbelt light goes OUT.  Jack SNAPS AWAKE. EVERYTHING IS NORMAL.  Some passengers get out of their seats.  From next to Jack, a VOICE we've heard before... \nVOICE There are three ways to make napalm. One, mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice... \nJack turns to see TYLER.  Without turned to Jack, Tyler continues: \nTYLER Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick. \nJACK Pardon me? \nTyler turns to Jack. \nJACK (V.O.) This is how I met -- \nTYLER Tyler Durden. \nTyler offers his hand.  Jack takes it. \nTYLER You know why they have oxygen masks on planes? \nJACK No, supply oxygen? \nTYLER Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths... \nTyler grabs a safety instruction CARD from the seatback, hands it to Jack. \nTYLER Suddenly, we become euphoic and docile.  We accept our fate. \nTyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures. \nTYLER Emergency water landing, 600 miles per hour.  Blank faces -- calm as Hindu cows. \nJack laughs. \nJACK What do you do, Tyler? \nTYLER What do you want me to do? \nJACK I mean -- for a living. \nTYLER Why?  So you can say, \"Oh, that's what you do.\" -- And be a smug little shit about it? \nJack laughs.  Tyler reaches under the seat in front of him and lifts a BRIEFCASE. \nTYLER You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh. \nJack points to his own briefcase. \nJACK We have the same briefcase. \nTyler turns the top of his briefcase toward Jack. \nTYLER Open it. \nJack looks at Tyler, then pops the latches and raises the lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of SOAP. \nTYLER Soap -- the yardstick of civilization. (reaches in his pocket) I make and sell soap... \nTyler hands Jack his card.  \"THE PAPER STREET SOAP COMPANY.\" \nTYLER If you were to add nitric acid to the soap-making process, one would get nitroglycerin.  With enough soap, one could blow up the world, if one were so inclined. \nTyler SNAPS the briefcase shut.  Jack stares. \nJACK Tyler, you are by far the most interesting \"single-serving\" friend I've ever met. \nTyler stares back.  Jack, enjoying his own chance to be witty, leans closer to Tyler. \nJACK (V.O.) The gas could have slowly filled the condo.  Seventeen-hundred square feet with high ceilings, for days and days. \nEXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING \nJack replaces the receiver.  He pockets Marla's number, digs out a small FILOFAX.  He flips through the pages for phone numbers and addresses.  Most of the pages are blank. \nDOORMAN Many young people feel trapped and desperate. \nINSERT - CLOSE ON THE BASE OF JACK'S REFRIGERATOR \nJACK (V.O.) Then, the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on... \nClick.  KABOOM!  SCREEN GOES WHITE. \nEXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING \nJack looks at the Doorman.  Tyler's BUSINESS CARD falls from the Filofax.  Jack catches it. \nDOORMAN If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't. \nThe Doorman walks away.  Jack stares at Tyler's card. \nJACK (V.O.) If you asked me now, I couldn't tell you why I called him. \nJack re-deposits the quarter, dials Tyler's number.  It RINGS... and RINGS and RINGS.  Jack sighs and hangs up the phone.  A moment, then the phone RINGS. \nJACK Hello? \nTYLER'S VOICE Who's this? \nJACK Tyler? \nTYLER'S VOICE Who's this? \nJACK Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy. \nTYLER'S VOICE Oh, yeah. \nJACK I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone. \nTYLER'S VOICE I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up? \nJACK Well... let me see... here's the thing... \nEXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT \nA small building in the middle of a concrete parking lot. \nINT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME \nJack and Tyler sit in the back, with a pitcher of BEER. \nJACK You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette. \nTYLER This is how we fill up our lives. \nTyler lights a cigarette. \nJACK I guess so. \nTYLER And, now it's gone. \nJACK All gone. \nTyler offers cigarettes.  Jack declines. \nTYLER Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car. \nJACK There's always that. \nTYLER I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy. \nJACK ...no ...no ... \nTYLER I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right? \nJack laughs, nods.  He shakes his head, drinks. \nTYLER But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered. \nJACK (toasts) Delivered from Swedish furniture. \nTYLER Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns. \nJACK Delivered from Martha Stewart. \nTYLER Delivered from bullshit colors like \"Cobalt,\" \"Ebony,\" and \"Fuchsia.\" \nThey laugh together.  Then, silence.  They drink. \nJACK Insurance'll cover it. \nTYLER Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list. \nJACK What list? \nTYLER The \"now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again\" list.  That list. \nJACK I don't... think so. \nTYLER This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks. \nJACK Well, I have to file a claim... \nTYLER The things you own, they end up owning you. \nJACK Don't I? \nTYLER Do what you like. \nJACK (looks at watch) God, it's late.  I should find a hotel... \nTYLER A hotel? \nJACK Yeah. \nTYLER So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel? \nJACK This is crazy. \nTYLER Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip. \nJACK Where do you want it?  In the face? \nTYLER Surprise me. \nJack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits Tyler's neck -- makes a dull, flat sound. \nJACK Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count. \nTYLER Like hell.  That counted. \nTyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest.  Jack falls back against a car.  His eyes tear up. \nTYLER How do you feel? \nJACK Strange. \nTYLER But a good strange. \nJACK Is it? \nTYLER We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off? \nJACK Call what off? \nTYLER The fight. \nJACK What fight? \nTYLER This fight, pussy. \nJack swings another roundhouse that slams right under Tyler's ear.  Tyler punches Jack in the stomach.  Tyler and Jack move clumsily, throwing punches.  They breathe heavier, drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact. \nEXT. CURBSIDE - LATER \nJack and Tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights on the nearby freeway.  Their eyes are glazed with endorphin- induced serenity.  They look at each other, laugh.  Look away. \nTYLER If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight? \nJACK Anyone? \nTYLER Anyone. \nJack thinks. \nJACK My boss, probably. (pause) Who would you fight? \nTYLER My dad.  No question. \nA long pause as Jack studies Tyler's face. \nJACK Oh, yeah. (nodding) I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family. \nTYLER He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go. \nJACK I know that. \nTYLER After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, \"Now what?\"  He said, \"Get a job.\"  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, \"Now what?\"  He said, \"I don't know. Get married.\" \nJACK Same here. \nTYLER A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need. \nAnother pause.  Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles. \nJACK We should do this again sometime. \nTyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack. \nEXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT \nA street sign: \"PAPER STREET.\"  A PAPER MILL stis on one side, facing a lone HOUSE on the other.  The rest of the land is grass and weeds.  It's a grand, old three-story, long abandoned.  Tyler leads Jack toward it. \nJACK Where's your car? \nTYLER What car? \nJACK (V.O.) I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year. \nINT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT \nTyler leads Jack through the FRONT DOOR... \nJACK (V.O.) It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.  Most of the windows were boarded up. \nINT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENT LATER \nTyler and Jack climb CREAKY STAIRS to the 2ND FLOOR LANDING. \nJACK (V.O.) None of the doors locked.  The stairs were ready to collapse.  I didn't know if he owned it or he was squatting. \nTyler opens the door to a ROOM... \nINT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJack enters, stis on the creaky BED.  Dust drifts upwards. \nJACK (V.O.) Neither would have surprised me. \nINT. SHOWER - MORNING \nJack turns on the water.  LOUD VIBRATIONS from the walls. Water spits in starts. \nJACK (V.O.) Nothing worked.  The rusty plumbing leaked.  Turning on a light meant another light in the house went out. \nEXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nAll the tavern's lights are off.  Tyler and Jack FIGHT. FIVE GUYS stand around watching. \nINT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING \nJack, his face showing NEW BRUISES AND CUTS, makes coffee with a wire-mesh strainer.  Tyler shuffles in, wearing a flannel bathrobe.  He spears pieces of bread on a fork, starts roasting them over a burner. \nJACK (V.O.) There were no neighbors.  Just warehouses and the paper mill.  The fart smell of steam, the hamster cage smell of wood chips. \nJACK (V.O.) It was right in everyone's face. Tyler and I just made it visible. \nIrvine hits a button and the JUKEBOX loses power.  Members of the waiting army begins to share secret looks.  Finally, one buy locks the door.  Two other guys close the blinds. \nJACK (V.O.) It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.  Tyler and I just gave it a name. \nINT. TAVERN BASEMENT - SAME \nA BOMB-SHELTER.  Concrete walls.  One BARE BULB above, Tyler standing directly beneath it. \nTYLER Welcome to fight club. \nThe guys mill around, finding partners.  Everyone brims with eagerness, but tries to act cool.  CHATTER gets LOUDER. Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, Tyler at center. \nJACK (V.O.) Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided. \nPEAKING CHATTER, till Tyler raises his arms and the CHATTER DIES.  A couple of COUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING, then, SILENCE. \nTYLER The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.  The second rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.  The third rule of fight club is -- when someone says \"stop\" or goes limp, the fight is over.  Fourth rule is -- only two guys to a fight.  Fifth rule -- one fight at a time.  Sixth rule -- no shirts, no shoes.  Seventh rule -- fights go on as long as they have to.  And the eighth and final rule -- if this is your first night at fight club, you have to fight. \nTyler steps back.  A short guy, RICKY, and a GOATEED MAN take off shirts and shoes and step to the center. \nJACK (V.O.) This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk -- couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black ink ... \nThe two fighters circle, then begin throwing PUNCHES... \nJACK (V.O.) But Ricky was a god for ten minutes last week when he trounced an actuary twice his size. \nHarder, faster PUNCHES between the two.  SWEAT flies. SHOUTS become DEAFENING.  Ricky's getting the best of Goateed Man, POUNDING him... \nJACK (V.O.) Sometimes all you could hear were flat, hard packing sounds over the yelling, or the wet choke when someone caught their breath and sprayed... \nGOATEED MAN (spittle-lipped) Ssssstop... ! \nINT. OFFICE PARK RESTAURANT - DAY \nJack, eating lunch, watches the BROKEN-NOSED WAITER with a GOATEE -- from the above fight -- converse with a MAITRE D'. \nJACK (V.O.) Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight, I wouldn't be talking to the same man. \nThe Goateed Waiter approaches Jack and sets a refill soda down on the table.  The two of them briefly make eye contact. \nJACK (V.O.) Who you were in fight club is not who you were in the rest of the world. \nINT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY \nJack stands over a copy machine, hit by flashes of light. He glances over his shoulder, watches Ricky, wearing an apron, push a supply cart.  Ricks nods at Jack. \nJACK (V.O.) You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.  But fight club only exists in the hours between when fight club starts and when fight club ends. \nINT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY \nJack, playing SOLITAIRE on his computer, daubs blood from his mouth with a handkerchief.  Boss, passing by the doorway, looks in at Jack, irritated. \nBOSS What are you getting yourself into every week? \nJack keeps playing Solitaire.  Boss enters, folds his arms. \nJACK (V.O.) After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything. \nBOSS Have you finished those reports? \nJACK (handing him reports) Yes. \nJACK (V.O.) The people who had power over you have less and less. \nJack looks at Boss.  Reflexively, Jack's tongue plays with his teeth. \nJACK (V.O.) By this point, I could wiggle most of the teeth in my jaw. \nEXT. STREET - DUSK \nTyler and Jack walk, both smoking cigarettes. \nJACK (V.O.) A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood. \nJACK If you could fight any celebrity? \nTYLER Alive or dead? \nJACK Doesn't matter. \nTYLER Hemingway.  You? \nJACK Shatner.  William Shatner. \nThey reach a BUS STOP as a BUS arrives, tossing their cigarettes, getting on board... \nINT. BUS - DUSK \nThe bus is crowded.  As Tyler and Jack walk toward the back, Jack studies the faces of OTHER PASSENGERS... \nJACK (V.O.) We all started seeing things differently.  Wherever we went. \nThey hold hand grips.  Jack looks up at an ADVERTISEMENT; a CALVIN KLEIN ad featuring a tan, bare-chested MUSCLE STUD. \nJACK (V.O.) I felt sorry for all the guys packing into gyms, trying to look like what Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said they should. \nTyler looks at Jack, looks at the C.K. advertisement. \nTYLER Self-improvement is masturbation. Self-destruction is the answer. \nA MAN in a suit KNOCKS Tyler's shoulder as he passes.  The Man takes a handle, close by.  Jack's pissed, staring at the man, who stares back. \nJACK (to Tyler, so the Man can hear) You could take him. \nTyler looks to Jack, glances over his shoulder at the Man. Tyler casually picks a small scab off Jack's nostril. \nTYLER The trick is not to care. \nTyler stares forward. \nINT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT \nTyler HITS the floor, stomach first.  HIS OPPONENT lands on top of him, grappling, trying for a CHOKE HOLD.  The surrounding CROWD, Jack included, SCREAMS at them... \nTyler and the Opponent wrestle desperately, and Tyler flips his attacker, gets on top, sprawling to pin him.  Tyler turns -- starts reining PUNCHES into the Opponent's GROIN... \nMARLA Do you want to wait to hear me describe death? \nJack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the hook, walks out the back door. \nMARLA'S VOICE Do you want to listen and see if my spirit can use the telephone? \nThru the archway: Tyler leans to look in, curious. \nINT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nGRUNTS of PLEASURE and EXERTION.  Glimpses of TORSOS, ASSES, LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, and FEMALE HAIR, all DRENCHED in SWEAT. Sheets RIP.  Bodies hit the FLOOR.  Insane GRUNTING and LAUGHING.  A flash of MARLA'S FACE. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JACK'S BEDROOM - SUNRISE \nJack sits up in bed, looks around the room. \nINT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING \nJack steps out of his room.  The neighboring door is closed. \nJACK (V.O.) Tyler's door was closed.  I'd been living here two months, and Tyler's door was never closed. \nINT. BATHROOM - SAME \nJack stares into the TOILER, looking at SIX USED CONDOMS. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nJack sits at the table, sips coffee, read Reader's Digest. He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. \nJACK You're not going to believe what I dreamt last night. \nMarla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's been raped by a hurricane.  Jack's jaw drops. \nMARLA I can hardly believe anything about last night. \nMarla goes to pour coffee.  She takes a swig, GARGLES and SPITS it in the sink.  She gives Jack a lascivious smile. \nJACK What are you doing here? \nMARLA What... ? \nJACK What the hell are you doing here? \nMarla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink. \nMARLA Fuck you. \nMarla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out. Jack gets up, watches her stomp away. \nJack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after Marla.  He's in his usual sweatpants.  He grins at Jack, then moves away, pours himself coffee.  Jack, smoldering, slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest.  Tyler puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises. \nTYLER She's a piece of work.  Get this -- I come in here last night, the phone's off the hook... \nJack pretends to read, quickly glances at Tyler.  TYLER'S VOICE FADES... \nJACK (V.O.) I already knew the story before he told it to me. \nINT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK) \nTyler enters, gently lifts the handset and listens. \nMARLA'S VOICE (from handset) I'll tell you when I'm floating out of my body. \nTyler smiles. \nJACK (V.O.) How could Tyler, off all people, think it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die? \nINT. MARLA'S - 8TH FLOOR LANDING - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK) \nTyler, a wry smile on his face, ambles up the stiars, looking at the rotting walls.  He reaches the top of the stairs and heads for Marla's room.  Before he can knock, Marla's hand shoots out and grabs him... \nINT. MARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK) \nMarla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door.  Her drugged eyes look him over. \nMARLA You got here fast. \nShe staggers and sits on the bed.  She slides off, along with the blanket and sheets, to the floor. \nMARLA The mattresses are all sealed in slippery plastic. \nShe tries to focus her eyes on Tyler. \nMARLA Did I call you? \nTyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a DILDO lying atop a dresser.  Marla follows his gaze. \nMARLA Don't worry.  It's not a threat to you. \nSIRENS and vehicles SCREECHING outside can be HEARD; doors opening and SLAMMING; running FOOTFALLS. \nMARLA Oh, no!  Somebody called the cops... \nShe gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, pulls him out the door. \nINT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK) \nMarla LOCKS her door, then pulls Tyler toward the STAIRCASE. COPS and PARAMEDICS charge up with oxygen and medical kits. Marla and Tyler flatten against the wall to let them pass. \nCOP 8-G!  Where's 8-G? \nMARLA (pointing) End of the hall. \nThe rescuers keep running. \nMARLA (calling after) The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl, but she's lost faith in herself... \nCOP Miss Singer, let us help you!  You have every reason to live! \nMarla yanks Tyler's arm, heading down the stairs. \nMARLA She's a monster!  Infectious human waste!  Good luck trying to save her! \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nTYLER The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes.  Like the first monkeys shot into space. \nThe saliva shines in the shape of the kiss.  Tyler pours a bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand. \nTYLER Without sacrifice, without death, we would have nothing. \nJack's whole body JERKS.  Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand and arm.  Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens. \nTYLER This is a chemical burn.  It will hurt more than you've ever been burned and you will have a scar. \nJack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of Tyler's kiss.  Jack's face spasms. \nJACK (V.O.) Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand. \nTYLER Look at your hand. \nJACK (V.O.) Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this. \nSHOT OF A GREEN MAPLE LEAF, GLISTENING WITH DEW.  RESUME: \nTyler looks at Jack's glazed and detached eyes. \nTYLER Come back to the pain.  Don't shut this out. \nJack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away.  Tyler keeps hold of it and their arms KNOCK UTENSILS off the table. \nJACK (V.O.) I tried not to think of the words \"searing\" or \"flesh.\"  I imagined my pain as a ball of healing white light. \nSHOT OF A FOREST, IN GENTLE SPRING RAINFALL.  RESUME: \nTyler JERKS Jack's hand, getting Jack's attention... \nTYLER Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it. \nJACK (V.O.) I was going to my cave to find my power animal. \nSHOT OF THE INSIDE OF JACK'S FROZEN ICE CAVE.  RESUME: \nTyler JERKS Jack's hand again.  Jack re-focuses on Tyler... \nTYLER Don't deal with this the way those dead people do.  Deal with it the way a living person does. \nSHOT OF INSIDE THE ICE CAVE - ON MARLA, LYING NAKED UNDER A FUR COAT, TURNING HER HEAD TO LOOK TOWARDS US.  RESUME: \nJack tries to pull his hand free.  Tyler won't let go. Jack's eyes glaze over again.  Jack speaks, whiny from pain: \nJACK I... I think I understand.  I think I get it... \nTYLER No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment. \nSHOT OF A GREEN FOREST WITHOUT RAIN.  RESUME: \nTyler SLAPS Jack's face, regaining his attention... \nTYLER This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it. \nJACK No, I'm not... \nSHOT OF TREES ENGULFED BY A FOREST FIRE.  RESUME: \nTYLER Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God? \nJACK I don't know... \nSHOT OF EMBERS POURING FROM THE HELLISH FOREST FIRE.  RESUME: \nTyler SLAPS Jack's face again... \nTYLER Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen... \nJACK It isn't... ? \nTYLER We don't need him... \nJACK We don't... ? \nSHOT OF INSIDE ICE CAVE - NAKED MARLA PULLS JACK DOWN ON TOP OF HER - JACK KISSES HER - CIGARETTE SMOKE COMES FROM HER MOUTH - JACK COUGHS.  RESUME: \nJack is a wide-eyed zombie... \nJACK ... Marla ... ? \nTYLER Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it. \nJack looks at Tyler -- they lock eyes.  Jack does his best to stifle his spasms of pain, his body a quivering, coiled knot.  He bolts toward the sink, but Tyler holds on. \nTYLER You can go to the sink and run water over your hand.  Look at me.  Or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn, but first you have to give up. First, you have to know that someday, you are going to die.  Until you know that, you will be useless. \nJack spasms with a shiver of pain... \nJACK You ... you don't know what this feels like, Tyler. \nTyler shows Jack a LYE-BURNED KISS SCAR on his own hand. Tears begin to drip from Jack's eyes.  Tyler grabs a bottle of VINEGAR -- pours it over Jack's wound. \nJack closes his eyes, holds his hand... slumps to the floor. \nTYLER Congratulations.  You're a step closer to hitting bottom. \nINT. BARNEY'S - DAY \nJack and Tyler, in trench coats, looking like deaht-warmed- over, wait as a BUYER fills out forms. \nThere are bars of \"The Paper Street Soap Company\" soap on the counter.  Jack looks like he's half-expecting to get arrested.  His hand is BANDAGED. \nJACK (V.O.) Tyler sold the soap to department stores at twenty bucks a Ear.  God knows what they charged.  How ironic. We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them. \nINT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY \nJack sits at his desk, playing a game on his computer, smoking a cigarette.  Boss enters. \nJACK (V.O.) He was wearing a yellow tie.  It must be Thursday.  I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore. \nBoss slaps a piece of PAPER down on Jack's desk. \nBOSS \"The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club.\" \nJack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray, stares up stoically. \nMARLA Yeah, we're done.  See you around. \nEXT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER \nJack emerges from the lobby.  He looks up at Marla's window, watches her silhouette.  He walks away, right into -- Big BOB, the moose, eating a donut and drinking orange juice. \nBOB Cornelius!  How are you? \nJACK Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you? \nBOB Better than I've ever been in my life. \nJACK Really?  Great.  Still \"Remaining Men Together?\" \nAn intense look of born-again fervor comes over Bob's face. \nBOB No.  I found something new. \nJACK Really, what's that? \nBOB (quietly) The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it... \nJACK Oh. \nBOB And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule... \nJACK Bob, Bob... I'm a member. \nBOB You are?! \nJACK Look at my face. \nBob roughly slaps Jack's shoulder. \nBOB That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations. \nJACK Yeah, both of us. \nBOB You know about the guy who invented it? I hear all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution.  They say he only sleeps one hour a night.  You know about this guy?  Tyler Durden? \nINT. BASEMENT - ELECTRONICS WKREHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe CROWD SCREAMS insanely as Bob and Jack go at it in the circle of light.  Bob's eyes are wild with glee. \nEXT. BASEMENT DOOR - ELECTRONICS WAREHOUSE - LATER \nEveryone sneaks out of this new location - we've seen none of these guys before - it's a new chapter.  Jack and Bob Stagger out last, Jack being in worse shape.  They both grin with religious serenity.  Bob hugs Jack. \nBOB Thank you.  Thank you. \nBob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a sack, completely enervated from the beating he took. \nJACK You're welcome. \nJACK (V.O.) Fight club -- this was mine and Tyler's gift... our gift to the world. \nINT. KITCHEN -- MORNING \nJack has his briefcase on the table, looks at PAPERWORK. Tyler wanders in, carries a dirty pot to the sink.  Jack takes out a cigarette, lights up.  He offers the pack... \nTYLER No thanks, I quit. \nJACK You quit? \nTYLER Yeah.  Where you headed? \nJACK Work.  Going to work. \nTyler scratches his chin absently. \nJACK What... ? \nTYLER Nothing.  Do what you like. \nTyler walks out the way he came. \nINT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY \nJack sits staring at his SCREEN SAVER. \nINT. BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY \nJack steps into the open doorway, knocks on the doorframe. Boss looks up from his large, expensive desk. \nJACK We need to talk. \nBOSS Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review... \nJACK I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise. \nBoss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged. \nJACK Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive. \nBOSS Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired! \nJACK What about this?  Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut.  I won't need to come to the office.  I can do this job from home. \nBoss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage. \nBOSS You little fucker!  I oughta... \nJack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose.  Blood starts to trickle. He punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by the force of the punch, SLAMS against a framed picture and SHATTERS the glass.  He falls to the floor. \nJACK (V.O.) I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge. \nJack gets back to his feet. \nJACK Please... don't hit me again, please. I'm your responsibility... \nHe PUNCHES himself in the stomach, then in the jaw again. He reels backwards, pulls down a hanging shelf, its contents flying.  He hits the floor. \nJACK (V.O.) For some reason, I thought of my first fight -- with Tyler. \nJack crawls toward Boss, dripping blood, grabs Boss's leg. \nJACK Please... give me the paychecks like I asked for.  I won't be any trouble. You won't see me again. \nTYLER Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and this whole fucking world... \nTyler's blood spatters on Lou.  Lou tries to shake Tyler off, but Tyler BITES Lou's NECKTIE.  The Thug grabs Tyler and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou.  Lou slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood.  Tyler spits and shouts through clenched teeth... \nTYLER You don't know where I've been. \nTyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor.  Tyler rubs his bloody face into Lou's face.  The Thug lifts Tyler.  Tyler clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged... \nTYLER We need this place.  We need it. Please let us keep it, please... \nBlood dribbles out of Tyler's mouth, spattering Lou. \nLOU What are you doing?! \nTYLER Pleeeeeease! \nLOU Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me! \nTYLER We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs. \nLOU Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go! \nTYLER Thank you.  Thank you, sir... \nLOU Let go of me!! \nTyler lets go of Lou's belt.  Lou scrambles away.  The Thug drops Tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood.  Lou gets to his feet, looks at Tyler, then at the rest of the guys.  He and the Thug back away... slamming the door behind. \nFight club surrounds Tyler.  They help him up, move him to a crate.  Tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike. \nTYLER This week, each of you has a homework assignment.  You're going to go out and start a fight with a total stranger... (pause, drooling blood) You're going to start a fight... and you're going to lose. \nJack beams in appreciation. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nRicky trips a passing YUPPIE.  The Yuppie falls. \nJACK (V.O.) Not as easy as it sounds.  People'll do just about anything to avoid a fight. \nThe Yuppies gets up, angry, and Ricky PUNCHES him... \nYUPPIE Hey!  Wha... What the hell... what are you doing?!  Who are you?!! \nThe Yuppie backs away.  Ricky follows... \nYUPPIE Get away from me!  Keep away! NO... ! \nRicky TACKLES the Yuppie.  The Yuppie struggles spastically. \nYUPPIE Who are you!?  Why are you attacking me... ?! \nHaving no recourse, the Yuppie begins trading blows. \nEXT. AUTO SHOP - DAY \nA MECHANIC WITH A BATTERED FACE uses a hose to wash the sidewalk.  As MEN pass, he jerks the hose up and SPRAYS them. \nFIRST MAN Hey... hey... \nSECOND MAN Watch out, jackass! \nThese men continue on their way. \nThe Mechanic sprays a third man, a SEMINARY STUDENT, who looks down, stunned. \nSEMINARIAN You... you did that on purpose! \nThe Mechanic DOUSES the Seminarian.  The Seminarian grabs the hose, wrestling the Mechanic for it.  The Mechanic shoves the Seminarian, who responds with a half-assed PUNCH. The Mechanic purposely takes it.  The Seminarian starts to run away.  The Mechanic sprints after him, PUNCHING the Seminarian in the back of the neck.  They fight. \nINT. RECORD STORE STOCKROOM - NIGHT \nA FIST smashes a JAW.  Guys CHEER.  An arm snakes around a neck and squeezes, blood and sweat dripping.  It's the YUPPIE and the SEMINARIAN fighting.  Tyler walks around the perimeter of the circle. \nJACK (V.O.) Now nobody was the center of fight club except the two men fighting. The leader walked around in the crowd, out in the darkness. \nTyler hands ENVELOPES out to the crowd. \nJACK (V.O.) Everyone took a homework assignment. \nEXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT \nRicky and another FIGHT CLUBBER paste up a BILLBOARD which reads: \"DID YOU KNOW? YOU CAN USE YOUR OLD MOTOR OIL TO FERTILIZE YOUR LAWN! -- ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.\" \nINT. PAPER STREET HOUSE \nHANDS use a MARKER, writing on a FILE: \"Disinformation.\" \nEXT. LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY \nJack and Tyler, in work gloves, armed with TOOLS, work together to lift the entire METAL PLATE of EXIT SPIKES from the ground.  They reverse it, then replace it. \nMOMENTS LATER \nJack and Tyler walk away, each carrying a 4x4 plank of WOOD. \nJACK There's fight club in Delaware City. \nTYLER I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights. \nAs they pass PARKED CARS, they SWING the planks against front bumpers -- activating ALARMS and INFLATING AIR BAGS... \nJACK Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week. \nTYLER Newcastle?  Did you start that one? \nJACK I thought you did. \nIn the background, a CAR quickly EXITS the parking lot -- front tires EXPLODING, wheel rims throwing sparks. \nINT. FAMILY HOUSEHOLD -- NIGHT \nFATHER, MOTHER, YOUNG DAUGHTER and SON, eat dinner, watching TELEVISION.  Suddenly, the TV IMAGE turns to SNOW and static. \nFamily members stop eating.  Father picks up the REMOTE, points it -- all channels are SNOW. \nFather turns the TV OFF.  He and his family members look at each other, utensils in hand, uncomfortable. \nTyler shoves Raymond's wallet back into Raymond's pocket. \nTYLER Would you rather be dead? \nRAYMOND No, please, no, God, no! \nTyler moves the gun right between Raymond's eyes. \nRAYMOND NOOOOO! \nTyler UNCOCKS the gun, lowers it. \nTYLER I'm keeping your license.  I know where you live.  I'm going to check on you.  If you aren't back in school and on your way to being a veterinarian in six weeks, you will be dead.  Get the hell out of here. \nRaymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway.  Jack and Tyler watch Raymond flee, then Tyler looks at Jack. \nJACK I feel sick. \nTYLER Imagine how he feels. \nTyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger -- CLICK.  Empty. \nJACK I don't care, that was horrible. \nTyler walks away. \nTYLER Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessell's life. \nJack watches Tyler go. \nTYLER His breakfast will taste better than any meal he has ever eaten. \nJack turns to look the direction Raymond ran.  He finally turns back, following after Tyler. \nINT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT \nSLOW MOTION: in the deserted office, gasoline filled COMPUTER MONITORS begin to EXPLODE...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM... ! \nEXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING \nLuxury AUTOMOBILES are parked, splattered with BIRD SHIT. \nEXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN \nVIEWED OUT 3RD STORY WINDOW: Tyler uses a RAKE, dragging it across rocks and dirt.  He stops a moment, rake on his shoulder, staring off.  Then, back to work... \nTYLER (muttering quietly) ... You are not how much money you have in the bank.  You are not the shoes you wear. \nTyler's marking a large SQUARE in the weeds and rubble of the backyard, kicking rocks away, dragging the rake... \nTYLER You are not the contents of your wallet... \nINT. CITY BUS - NIGHT \nThe DRIVER has a broken nose.  The bus is empty, except for Jack, in the very last seat, sleepy. \nJACK (V.O.) He had a plan.  Maybe you just didn't see it till it hit you between the eyes. (pause) But, it started to make sense... in a Tyler sort of way.  No fear.  No distractions.  The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide. \nEXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT \nJack gets off the bus.  As the bus pulls away, we see it dropped Jack off right in front of the house. \nINT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nJack enters.  Tyler, dressed in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT, grabs BEERS from the refrigerator. \nJACK Hey. \nTYLER Hey. \nJack notices ROPE and RAPPELLING TOOLS on the table.  Tyler comes to hand Jack a bunch of beers, nod to the living room. \nTYLER Go on in.  We're celebrating. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJack, bewildered, enters carrying beers.  Tyler does NOT follow.  BOB, RICKY and several other fight club guys sit in front at the TV, chanting not too loudly, all also dressed in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT. \nRICKY You are not your job. \nOTHERS TOGETHER You are not your job. \nRICKY You are not how much money you have in the bank. \nBOB Shhhh, wait... they're back to it... \nBob goes to turn up the TV.  One guy, sixteen years old with an angelic face, ANGEL FACE, gets up to take beer from Jack. \nANGEL FACE (to Jack) Great, thanks. \nAngel face starts distributing beer amongst his cohorts. \nBOB Shhhhh!  Watch! \nJack looks to the TV -- it shows a LIVE shot of the \"PARKER MORRIS BUILDING.\"  The building has a GIANT, GRINNING FACE PAINTED on it -- two BROKEN WINDOWS for EYES, with flames pouring out... FIRETRUCKS spray water. \nREPORTER (V.O.) Police Commissioner Jacobs has just arrived... just a second... excuse me, Commissioner, could you tell us what you think has happened? \nCOMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled official, turns to camera. \nCOMMISSIONER JACOBS (V.O.) We believe this is related to the recent acts of vandalism around the city.  It's some kind of organized group, and we are coordinating a rigorous investigation. \nJack turns, sees Tyler in the archway, watching him.  Tyler tips his beer to toast, pulls back, out of sight. \nJACK What did you guys do? \nThey all BURST INTO LAUGHTER.  They look at Jack and shake their heads.  Jack doesn't get it.  Suddenly, the guys' faces turn to stone.  Bob sits rigid. \nBOB The first rule of Project Mayhem is... you do not ask questions. \nJack stares at them. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT \nA luxurious BANQUET.  Commissioner Jacobs guzzles champagne. He rises and starts out of the room.  Jack, in a WAITER'S UNIFORM, looks apprehensively to OTHER WAITERS: BOB... RICKY... ANGEL FACE -- who all give each other a look. \nJACK What the hell ... ?! \nTYLER You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you. \nJACK I'm not asking you to. \nTYLER You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else. \nJACK I don't think that's true. \nTyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up. Through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a TRUCK. \nJACK Tyler... what is this... ! \nJack fights\tto turn the wheel, but Tyler uses both hands. \nTYLER What will you wish you'd done before you died? \nRICKY Paint a self-portrait. \nMECHANIC Build a house. \nTYLER (to Jack) And you? \nJACK I don't know!  Nothing! \nTYLER If you died right now, how would you feel about your life? \nJACK I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?! \nThe oncoming truck HONKS and FLASHES its LIGHTS.  It moves to the other side of the road.  Tyler steers there, too. \nTYLER I want to hear the truth. \nJACK Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that? \nTYLER Why do you think I blew up your condo? \nJACK What? \nTYLER Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me. \nNearing impact with the oncoming truck, Tyler takes his hands off the wheel -- Jack keeps his grip, turns the wheel... the car swerves... \nThe truck ROARS past, spraying water, HORN BLASTING. \nTyler looks at Jack, his hands in the air.  Jack looks at Tyler with dead eyes. \nJACK Okay, okay... fine... \nJack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air. Tyler studies Jack face, impressed.  Tyler makes no move to take the wheel. \nTHROUGH THR WINDSHIELD: a STALLED CAR ahead on the side of the road, surrounded by flares. \nJack and Tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the shoulder... heading for the stalled car.  Their faces are illuminated by the light of the flares.  Tyler smiles. \nThey SMASH into the stalled car -- AIRBAGS INFLATE!  The back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass- over-tea-kettle ROLL down a hill... \nJACK (V.O.) I'd never been in a car accident. This must've been what all those statistics felt like before I filed them into my reports. \nThe car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof. \nEXT. OVERTURNED CAR \nTyler crawls from the passenger side.  He walks around... opens the driver's side door and drags Jack out into the mud.  Ricky and the Mechanic climb out the broken rear window.  Tyler sits beside the stunned, wounded Jack. \nTYLER We just had a near-life experience. \nINT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nJack lies in bed, traumatized, eyes empty, staring at the ceiling.  Tyler sits in a nearby chair. \nTYLER In the world I see -- you're stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.  You will wear leather clothes that last you the rest of your life.  You will climb the wrist- thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower.  You will see tiny figures pounding corn and laying-strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of the ruins of a superhighway. \nTyler stands, gives Jack's head a pat. \nTYLER (leaving) Feel better, champ. \nINT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nJack sits at the table, sips coffee.  He's pale, dazed, seems broken.  He hears the faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING, unsure of where it's coming from. \nMarla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the counter.  Her back is to Jack as he looks at her.  She pours ccffee and lights a cigarette.  A beat of silence, then: \nMARLA I'll be out of your way in a sec. \nShe seems to be as weak as Jack. \nJACK You... don't have to... leave. \nMARLA Whatever. \nJACK Really... I mean it. (pause) Have you been going to your groups? \nMARLA Chloe's dead. \nJACK When? \nMARLA Do you care? \nJACK I don't know. \nMARLA It was the smart move on her part. \nMarla turns to face Jack, a grim expression on her face. There's a BRUISE on her ARM.  Jack gets up, moves closer. \nJACK Why are we both... caught up like this... with... ? \nJACK (V.O.) I came so close to saying Tyler's name, I could feel it vibrate inside my mouth. \nMarla looks a him, waiting. \nJACK I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto? \nMARLA What do you get out of it? \nFaint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING.  Jack can't quite figure where it's coming from. \nJACK Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you... \nMECHANIC I understand. \nEveryone just stares at Jack. \nMECHANIC In death, a member of Project Mayhem has a name. \nJACK No -- ! \nMECHANIC His name is Robert Paulson. \nRICKY His name is Robert Paulson! \nJACK No! \nALL SPACE MONKEYS His name is Robert Paulson! \nJACK Stop that -- ! \nALL SPACE MONKEYS (louder) His name is Robert Paulson!  His name is Robert Paulson... \nJack backs away, surrounded, PUSHES his way out of the room. \nINT. TYLER'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nJack barges in, goes to the desk, rifling through drawers. He finds FLIGHT COUPONS, used and unused.  The used coupons. have the flight information, including the destination cities.  The PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it... \nJACK Tyler? \nDETECTIVE STERN'S VOICE (from phone) This is Detective Stern of the arson unit.  I'd like to see you in my office tomorrow morning... \nJack, in a panic, HANGS UP. \nINSERT - AN AIRPLANE TAKES OFF... \nINT. PLANE CABIN - DAY \nJack sits stiffly in a seat. \nJACK (V.O.)

He sees several MALE PATRONS with FIGHT BRUISES.  Jack moves to the bar.  The BARTENDER has a broken arm and swollen face. \nJACK I'm looking for Tyler Durden. \nBARTENDER Never heard of him. \nJACK This is an emergency.  It's important I find him. \nBARTENDER I wish I could help you... sir. \nThe bartender WINKS at Jack. \nINSERT - AERIAL VIEW - ATLANTA SKYLINE - NIGHT \nJACK (V.O.)

DRY CLEANERS - DAY \nThe PROPRIETOR, his head bandaged, is confronted by Jack. \nJACK I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me? \nBANDAGED PROPRIETOR Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior. \nJACK (pointing) There's no one else here. \nBANDAGED PROPRIETOR I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. \nJACK Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden. \nBANDAGED PROPRIETOR I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able. \nJack looks around, incredibly frustrated. \nJACK You are a moron. \nBANDAGED PROPRIETOR I'm afraid I have to insist you leave. \nJack gives up, shoves his way out the door. \nINT. CITY BUS - DAY \nJack sits on the bus, looking out the window.  The bus stops. \nJACK Say my name. \nMARLA What... ? \nJACK Say my name!  What's my name!? \nMARLA Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there... \nJACK Marla, no, wait... \nAs Marla HANGS UP.  Jack stares at the receiver, dazed... \nTYLER'S VOICE We've got six fight clubs in Chicago now... \nJack spins, dropping the phone -- TYLER sits beside him. \nTYLER Four in Milwaukee. \nJACK What's this all about, Tyler? \nTYLER And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South. \nJACK Why do people think I'm you? \nTYLER You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me. \nJACK Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden? \nTYLER Why did you do that? \nJACK Answer me, Tyler. \nTYLER Why do people think anything? \nJACK I don't know!  Tell me! \nTyler shakes his head in disgust, extremely irritated. \nTYLER People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body. \nJACK What... ? \nTYLER Is this really news to you? \nJACK What are you talking about... ? \nTYLER Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me... \nFLASHBACK - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nCommissioner Jacobs checks his tie in a mirror, goes to open the door of the MEN'S BATHROOM -- face to face with JACK. \nFLASHBACK - LOU'S BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT \nJACK stands surrounded by eager fight club MEMBERS, under the bare bulb, talking and behaving like Tyler... \nJACK The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING \nTYLER And, sometimes you control it... \nFLASHBACK - EXT. PAPER STREET HOUSE - DAY \nJack stands in the yard, VODKA in hand, yells at Marla. \nJACK He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away! \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING \nTYLER You can see me and hear me, but no one else can... \nFLASHBACK - CURBSIDE - NIGHT \nJACK sits alone on the curb, watching the nearby freeway. He talks to someone beside him, but nobody's there. \nJACK Anyone? (thinks) My boss, probably. (pause) Who would you fight? \nJack listens, looks at the empty space beside him. \nJACK Oh, yeah. (nodding) I didn't really know my Dad... \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING \nTYLER But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you... \nFLASHBACK - TYLER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJACK is on top of Marla, sweating, making violent love... \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING \nTYLER I go places without you.  Get things done... \nFLASHBACK - BUILDING - NIGHT \nThe Parker Morris Building. \nJACK, Bob, Ricky, Angel Face and another GUY rappel down the side, SPRAYING PAINT.  JACK is \"TYLER\" in demeanor, mannerisms, speech... \nJACK (shouting) You are not your job.  You are not how much money you have in the bank. \nTWO WINDOWS SHATTER OUTWARD -- TWO MEN look out and yell: \nBRUISED MAN #1 I am not my job! \nBRUISED MAN #2 I am not how much money I have in the bank! \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING \nJack's having trouble catching his breath.  Tyler stands. \nTYLER There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done! \nJACK This isn't possible... \nTYLER We're going to have to do something about Marla... \nVOICE You told me you'd say that, too. \nJACK Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?! \nVOICE Well, sir, you said you might. \nJack HANGS UP, desperately dials the next number on the bill. \nDIFFERENT VOICE (front phone) Twenty-one-sixty.  Maintenance. \nJack sees a file: \"2160 PICO BOULEVARD.\"  He throws the phone, pocketing the bill.  He grabs up all the FILES. \nEXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET \nJack's TAXI halts.  Marla walks out of the lobby doors, sees Jack getting out of the cab, laden with files... \nJACK Marla! \nMarla makes a sharp turn, walking away.  Jack follows, hugging the files to his chest, catching up. \nJACK Marla... \nMARLA Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm. \nJACK I'm sorry, I... \nMARLA The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable. \nJACK Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out. \nMARLA Here comes an avalanche of bullshit. \nMarla heads into a DINER.  Jack follows... \nJACK -- A little more faith than that. \nINT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER \nMarla sits in a BOOTH.  Jack sits across from her. \nMARLA I don't want to hear anything you've got to say. \nJACK Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds. \nMARLA Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here. \nJACK Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor. \nMARLA I've done you enough favors. \nA WAITER with a BLACK EYE appears at the table. \nWAITER Sir!  Anything you order is free of charge, sir. \nMARLA Why is it free of charge? \nJACK Because... I'm Tyler Durden. \nMARLA Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie. \nJack look to the pass-through WINDOW into the kitchen where THREE COOKS look out with STITCHES in their faces. \nJACK Clean food, please. \nWAITER In that case, sir, may I advise against the lady eating the clam chowder? \nJACK Thanks, no clam chowder.  That's it. \nThe waiter snaps to attention and leaves. \nMARLA You got about thirty seconds. \nJACK (takes a deep breath) I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me. \nMARLA Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass. \nJACK I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized \nMARLA What? \nJACK I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you... \nMARLA Whatever. (to waiter) I'll take my food to go... \nMarla's getting up to go, but Jack rises, fed up, takes her by the arm, putting her back in her seat. \nJACK Sit down!  Sit down and give me my last fifteen seconds without opening your mouth! \nMarla crosses her arms.  Jack collects himself. \nJACK I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger. \nMARLA What? \nJACK You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city... \nMARLA You are an insane person. \nJACK Marla... \nMARLA No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried... \nMarla's getting upset, tears coming to her eyes. \nMARLA There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me... \nJACK I'm sorry, but I... \nMARLA What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute. \nMarla gets up.  Jack grabs for her, but she's gone, heading for the door.  Jack gathers his files, runs to follow... \nEXT. DINER - MOMESTS LATER \nJack pushes out the door, files under one arm, catching up... \nJACK I can't explain.  You wouldn't believe me anyway.  I'm trying to protect you... \nJack gets one leg free, KICKS, knocks Flat-top backwards -- Flat-Top SLAMS the wall, falls.  Redhead lets go of one of Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat... cutting off the airway.  Jack's face reddens... he's choking... \nJack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls Redhead's GUN and points it at him.  Redhead backs off. Jack gets up, gasping for air, PISTOL-WHIPS Flat-top as he rises. \nJack grabs one of the files off the table. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nJack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK DOOR.  He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder. \nEXT. STREET \nJack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand, looking like a complete madman.  Cars almost hit him. \nEXT. BANK BUILDING - LATER \nJack, sweating and panting, stops, looks... then heads toward the BUILDING with the address \"1888.\" \nEXT. 1888 LOBBY \nJack tries the door.  Locked.  He lifts a cast iron bench, runs forward -- RAMS it into the glass.  The bench immediately recoils from the glass, SLAMS Jack's groin! Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package. Then, he rises, SHOOTS the glass... \nINT. 1888 LOBBY \nJack pushes through the broken glass.  He sprints for the \"PARKING\" door... \nINT. GROUND LEVEL - PARKING \nJack enters, looks -- NO CARS.  He bolts to the STAIRS... \nINT. TOP-LEVEL PARKING AREA - SEVENTH FLOOR \nJack enters, heaving.  Again, NO CARS.  He moves from one SUPPORT POST to another, searching.  He finally spies, across the garage, NINE LARGE CANISTERS, heavily-WIRED. \nJack runs to the BOMB, frantic.  He walks around it. There's a DIGITAL CLOCK, ticking down from \"10:05\"... \nJack moves to pull the lid off one CANISTER, looks inside.. \nTYLER Could be worse... \nJack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post. \nTYLER You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be... \nJACK (points at bomb) You... you can't be serious about this. \nTYLER What a ridiculous thing to say. \nJACK I can't let you... \nTYLER ...go through with this? What are you going to do? \nJACK I'm going to... \nTYLER ...stop me? \nJACK I'm not going... \nTYLER ...to let this happen! \nJACK Stop finishing... \nTYLER ...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that. \nTyler gets up walks to Jack. \nTYLER What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body. \nJACK Since when is Project Mayhem about murder? \nTYLER The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned. \nJACK You don't know that.  There could still be people inside. \nTyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms. \nTYLER Maybe.  Maybe a couple of guys with shaved heads couldn't synchronize their watches.  Good riddance. \nJack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his face.  He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them. \nTYLER I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order... \nJACK If you know, I know. \nJack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go through the tangle of colored wires. \nTYLER Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent the whole day thinking about the wrong ones. \nJack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers. \nJACK If I'm wrong, we're both dead.. \nTYLER This is not about martyrdom. \nJack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger. \nJACK I'm pulling the green wire. \nTYLER Green?  Did you say green? \nTyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look, seems genuinely concerned. \nJACK Yes... \nTYLER Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire. \nJACK Fuck you. \nTYLER I'm serious.  That's the wrong one. \nJack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers trembling.  The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below... \nTYLER Hear that?  Marla's here.  Just in the nick of time, eh? \nJack looks to Tyler.  Tyler points towards the SOUND... \nTYLER See for yourself. \nJack gets up, breathing hard, holding his head, follows... \nON THE STAIRS, Tyler reaches the LOFT LEVEL, above the lobby, disappears around a corner.  Jack's right behind, turning the corner -- Tyler's NOT THERE. \nJack receives a SHARP SLAP on the back of the head.  He wheels.  Tyler isn't there.  A TAP on his shoulder.  Jack turns around -- WHAM! -- Tyler PUNCHES his face.  Jack falls against the loft railing.  Tyler comes forward, SWINGS... \nSECURITY MONITOR P.O.V. \nJack PUNCHES himself square in the nose! \nINT. MAIN LOBBY \nJack's dazed.  Tyler grabs Jack's shirt, pulls him forward, SWINGS HIM -- THROWS him DOWN THE STAIRS... \nJack TUMBLES horribly down... HITS BOTTOM, striking his head on the floor.  Jack PASSES OUT... \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINT. LARGE SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR \nCLOSE ON: Jack's head jerks back as he SNAPS AWAKE.  He looks around, trying to focus his eyes... \nJACK'S P.O.V. -- TRACKS in the sawdust of the floor, from where his body was dragged across to where he is how. \nCLOSE ON: Jack tries to comprehend.  He turns his head -- TYLER'S HAND brings the GUN up, PUTS THE GUN IN JACK'S MOUTH.  Jack freezes, looks around with his eyes... \nPULL BACK TO: \nTyler is seated in Jack's lap.  Tyler holds the gun in Jack's mouth, his arm around him.  This huge room is being remodeled.  Tyler and Jack are seated near floor-to-ceiling windows affording a spectacular view of the CITY. \nTyler looks at his watch. \nTYLER One minute. \nJACK (V.O.) I think this is about where we came in. \nTYLER (looking out window) This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion. \nJACK i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin... \nJack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth. \nJACK (still distorted) I still can't think of anything. \nTyler checks his watch. \nTYLER It's getting exciting now. \nJack turns, so he can see down -- 31 STORIES. \nTYLER Look what we've accomplished. (checks watch) Thirty seconds. (looks out windows) Out these windows, we will view the economic collapse.  One step closer to global equilibrium.  I'm glad you're here with me. \nTyler watches the skyline, WHISTLES at tune, waiting. \nJACK (distorted) Can't you call it off... ? \nTYLER It's out of our hands. (looks at watch) This is it. \nJACK Please... \nTYLER Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8.... \nTyler looks out the windows, at SURROUNDING BUILDINGS, excited.  Jack closes his eyes, despairing. \nTYLER \nOut the window, the SKYLINE remains unchanged.  Nothing.  A long beat.  A very dark scowl comes over Tyler's face. \nJack opens his eyes.  More waiting.  Tyler looks genuinely surprised, pissed-off. \nTYLER What the fuck -- ? \nJACK Paraffin. \nTYLER What? \nJACK (relieved) Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. (more) \nJACK (cont) They must've run out of cotton and Epsom salt.  Paraffin is iffy at best. \nTyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts pacing.  Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile. \nTYLER Damn it!  God-damn it... \nJACK Not exactly according to plan. \nTYLER Do we have to do everything ourselves?! \nTyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust.  He reaches into his pocket, taking out a WALKIE TALKIE. \nTYLER (into WALKIE TALKIE) ... Codename Rooster.  Passcode First Strike... \nJack's eyes go wide. \nJACK NO... \nTYLER (into WALKIE TALKIE) Proceed with remote detonation. \nJack leaps -- TACKLES Tyler.  The GUN is knocked away.  Jack STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles off... \nJack gets the gun, turns, pointing it.  Tyler's getting to his feet, sees the gun, annoyed.  Jack stands. \nTYLER Haven't we already done this? \nJack SHOOTS TWICE.  Bullets pass right thorough Tyler. Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the floor and STOMPS on it, CRUSHING it. \nJACK (pointing) How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state... \nTYLER Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination. \nJack falters, pointing at Tyler's feet.  There's no walkie- talkie there.  Jack looks down, sees the WALKIE-TALKIE CRUSHED under his own foot. \nJACK Oh... Christ... \nJack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end. \nJACK Why... why... why... ? \n", "test1_input": "FIGHT CLUB \nF I G H T   C L U B \nby Jim Uhls \nbased on a novel by Chuck Palahnuik \nSCREEN BLACK \nJACK (V.O.) People were always asking me, did I know Tyler Durden. \nFADE IN: \nINT.  SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT \nTYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH. Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap. \nThey are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch. \nTYLER One minute. (looking out window) This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion. \nJACK ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin... \nJACK (V.O.) With a gun barrel between your teeth, you only speak in vowels. \nJack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth. \nJACK (still distorted) I can't think of anything. \nJACK (V.O.) With my tongue, I can feel the rifling in the barrel.  For a second, I totally forgot about Tyler's whole controlled demolition thing and I wondered how clean this gun is. \nTyler checks his watch. \nTYLER It's getting exciting now. \nJACK (V.O.) That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way. \nJack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES. \nJACK (V.O.) We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this. \nTYLER Look what we've accomplised. (checks watch) Thirty seconds. \nJACK (V.O.) Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer. \nPULL BACK from Jack's face.  It's pressed against TWO LARGE BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man.  Jack is engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace.  Bob weeps openly. \nJACK (V.O.) Bob had bitch tits. \nPULL BACK to wide on... \nINT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \nMen are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones. Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: \"REMAINING MEN TOGETHER.\" \nJACK (V.O.) This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob. \nBOB We're still men. \nJACK Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are. \nJACK (V.O.) Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big. \nBOB They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid. \nBob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes. \nBOB Okay.  You cry now. \nJack looks at Bob. \nJACK (V.O.) Wait.  Back up.  Let me start earlier. \nINT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. \nJACK (V.O.) For six months.  I could not sleep. \nINT. COPY ROOM - DAY \nJack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine.  His Starbucks cup sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies. \nJACK (V.O.) With insomnia, nothing is real. Everything is far away.  Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy. \nOther people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping. Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves. \nINT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME \nJack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the floor, full of newspapers and FAST FOOD GARBAGE. \nJACK (V.O.) When deep space exploration ramps up, it will be corporations that name everything.  The IBM Stellar Sphere. The Philip Morris Galaxy.  Planet Starbucks. \nJack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's BOSS, enters, Starbucks cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk. \nBOSS I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some \"red-flags\" to cover. \nJACK (V.O.) It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his \"cornflower-blue\" tie. \nJACK (listless management speak) You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade? \nBOSS You need to make these your primary \"action items.\" \nJACK (V.O.) He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema. \nBOSS Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary... \nJack hides a yawn, pretends to listen. \nINT. BATHROOM - JACK'S CONDO - NIGHT \nJack sits on the toilet, CORDLESS PHONE to his ear, flips through an IKEA catalog.  There's a stack of old Playboy magazines and other catalogs nearby. \nJACK (V.O.) Like everyone else, I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct. \nJACK (into phone) Yes.  I'd like to order the Erika Pekkari slip covers. \n", "test1_true": "MOVE IN ON CATALOG -- ON PHOTO of COFFEETABLE SET... \nJACK (V.O.) If I saw something like clever coffee table sin the shape of a yin and yang, I had to have it. \nPAN TO PHOTO of ARMCHAIR... \nJACK (V.O.) Like the Johanneshov armchair in the Strinne green stripe pattern... \nINT. LIVING ROOM/DINING AREA/KITCHEN \nThe armchair APPEARS.  PAN OVER next to armchair... \nJACK (V.O.) Or the Rislampa wire lamps of environmentally-friendly unbleached paper. \nThe lamps APPEAR.  PAN OVER to wall... \nJACK (V.O.) Even the Vild hall clock of galvanized steel, resting on the Klipsk shelving unit. \nThe clock APPEARS as the shelving unit APPEARS on the wall. \nJACK (V.O.) I would flip through catalogs and wonder, \"What kind of dining set defines me as a person?\"  We used to read pornography.  Now it was the Horchow Collection. \nA dining room set APPEARS.  Jack, the cordless phone still glued to his ear, walks INTO FRAME and continues. \nJACK No, I don't want Cobalt.  Oh, that sounds nice.  Apricot. \nJack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate. \nJACK (V.O.) I had it all.  Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections, proof they were crafted by the honest, simple, hard-working indigenous peoples of wherever. \nHe rummages through the refrigerator.  It's practically empty.  Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses a butter knife to eat it. \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nJack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before an INTERN, who studies him with bemusement. \nINTERN No, you can't die of insomnia. \nJACK Maybe I died already.  Look at my face. \nINTERN You need to lighten up. \nJACK Can't you give me something? \nJACK (V.O.) Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals. \nINTERN (overlapping w/ above) You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise. \nThe Intern ushes Jack to the door.  They step into the... \nINT. HALLWAY \nThe Intern walks away from Jack, picks up a chart. \nJACK I'm in pain. \nINTERN (facetious) You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain. \nThe Intern moves into the other room.  Jack stares after him. \nEXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT \nJack heads for the front door. \nINT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT \nJack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all listening to a group member speak at a lectern.  The SPEAKER has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying. \nSPEAKER I... wanted three kids.  Two boys and a girl.  Mindy wanted two girls and one boy.  We never could agree on anything. \nThe Speaker cracks a sad smile.  Some men chuckle, happy to lighten the mood. \nSPEAKER Well, she had her first child a month ago, a girl, with her new husband... And, Thank God.  I'm glad for her, because she deserves... \nThe speaker breaks down, WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY. \nJack watches.  A couple of the men go up to the speaker, comforting him, leading him away.  A LEADER takes the stand. \nLEADER Everyone, let's thank Thomas for sharing himself with us. \nJack, uncomfortable, joins EVERYONE ELSE: \nEVERYONE (in unison) Thank you, Thomas. \nLEADER I look around this room and I see a lot of courage.  And it gives me strength.  We give each other strength. \nJack looks around.  Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing. Jack squirms in his seat. \nLEADER It's time for the one-on-one.  Let's follow Thomas's example and open ourselves. \nEveryone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off. Jack stands, uncomfortable. \nLEADER Can everyone find a partner? \nBob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack, shuffling his feet. \nJACK (V.O.) The big moosie, his eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.  Knees together, invisible steps. \nBob takes Jack into an embrace. \nJACK (V.O.) Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea. \nBOB ...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls... \nJACK (V.O.) Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one. \nBob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on Jack's shoulder and completely covering Jack's face.  After a long beat of crying, Bob raises up his head, looks at Jack's NAMETAG. \nBOB Go ahead, Cornelius.  You can cry. \nThey look at each other.  Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet. \nJACK (V.O.) Then... something happened.  I was lost in oblivion -- dark and silent and complete. \nBob pulls Jack's head back into his chest.  Jack tightens his arms around Bob. \n", "test1_id": 366, "test2_input": "Tyler scratches his head, wears a RUBBER GLOVE. \nTYLER You want to finish her off? \nJACK Uh... nah... \nJack continues toward his room. \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nJack brushes his teeth. \nJACK (V.O.) I became the calm, little center of the world.  I was the Zen master. \nCLOSE UP - COMPUTER MONITOR \nHaiku is BEING TYPED in a trendy, italicized font. \n\"Worker bees can leave Even drones can fly away The queen is their slave\" \nJACK (V.O.) I wrote little haiku poems. \nINT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY \nJack's clothes are PERMANENTLY STAINED with BLOOD.  He sits in Zen pose, cigarette in mouth, finishes typing Haiku. \nJACK (V.O.) I faxed them around to everyone. \nHe hits \"SEND,\" gets the \"ERROR CHIME\" SOUND.  He presses this key over and over.  Boss enters. \nBOSS Is that your blood? \nJACK Some of it, yes. \nBoss stares at Jack like he's from Mars. \nBOSS Take the rest of the day off.  Come back tomorrow with clean clothes. Get yourself together. \nINT. HALLWAY - SAME \nJack's leaving, looks like a war casualty, passing COWORKERS who coldly stare at him.  His face is totally passive. \nJACK (V.O.) I got right in everyone's hostile little face.  Yes, these are bruises from fighting.  I'm comfortable with them.  I am enlightened. \nEXT. PAPER STREET - SUNSET \nJack walks toward the HOUSE. \nJACK (V.O.) You give up the condo life, give up all your flaming worldly possessions, go live in a dilapidated house in the toxic waste part of town... \nINT. TYLER'S KITCHEN - SUNSET \nJack walks in.  SOUNDS of VIOLENT SEX and a POLAROID CAMERA from upstairs.  Pieces of PLASTER fall from the ceiling. \nJACK (V.O.) ... and you come home to this. \nTYLER'S VOICE (laughing) You fucking slut!! \nMARLA'S VOICE Thank you, sir, may I have another! Thank you sir, may I have another... ! \nJack rolls his eyes, takes off his pants.  He runs water in the sink, finds a tiny bit of SOAP and scrubs at the blood stains.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers it. \nJACK Yeah.  Speaking. \nINTERCUT WITH... \nINT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE \nA cop, DETECTIVE STERN, refers to a file. \nDETECTIVE STERN This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the \"incident\" at your condo. \nJACK Yes? \nDETECTIVE STERN I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder. \nJACK No, I wasn't aware... \nJACK (V.O.) I am Jack's Cold Sweat. \nDETECTIVE STERN Does this sound strange to you? \nJACK Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange. \nJack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively. \nDETECTIVE STERN The dynamite... \nJACK Dynamite? \nDETECTIVE STERN Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means? \nJACK What does that mean? \nDETECTIVE STERN It means it was homemade. \nJACK This is... really a shock... \nDETECTIVE STERN Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator. \nJACK Who do you think could've done this? \nDETECTIVE STERN I'll ask the questions, son. \nTYLER (whispering in Jack's ear) Tell him... \nJack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see Tyler standing right next to him. \nJACK Huh? \nTYLER (overlap w/below) \"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception.\" \nJACK Shhhhhh! (into phone, overlap w/above) I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't... \nDETECTIVE STERN Do you know anyone who'd have the expertise or motive to do something like this? \nTYLER \"I reject the basic assumptions of civilization, including material possession.\" \n", "test2_true": "JACK (into phone) No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were... \nJACK (V.O.) I'd like to thank the academy... \nDETECTIVE STERN Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning. \nEND INTERCUT \nJack hangs up.  Tyler shrugs. \nTYLER Could be worse.  You could be cursed with the three terrible Karmas.  You could be beautiful, rich and famous. \nJack turns away, continues to scrub his pants.  Marla's FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming downstairs... \nJack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing water.  He turns, sees Marla enter.  Tyler is GONE.  Marla lights a cigarette. \nJACK (V.O.) Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room. \nMARLA I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar. \nJACK (keeps scrubbing) Worth every penny. \nJACK (V.O.) My parents pulled this exact act for years -- one came in, the other disappeared. \nMarla begins a slow, exotic dance, moving very close to Jack.  She lifts her dress dangerously high, dancing close to Jack's body, almost touhcing. \nMARLA (seductive) It's a bridesmaid's dress.  Someone loved it intensely for one day, then tossed it.  Like a Christmas tree -- so special, then, bam -- it's abandoned on the side of the road, tinsel still clinging to it... \nJack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses against the counter.  Marla pulls her hemline further up. \nMARLA Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape. \nJACK (coldly) It suits you. \nShe leans in very close to Jack's ear, whispers hoarsely: \nMARLA You can borrow it sometime. \nJack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing.  Marla blows smoke in his face.  Jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the sink.  Marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going UPSTAIRS. \nTYLER (O.S.) Get rid of her. \nJack turns to see Tyler in the doorway. \nJACK You get rid of her. \nTYLER (pointing at Jack) Don't mention me. \nMarla's FOOTSTEPS are coming DOWNSTAIRS.  Jack looks to the archway, then back at -- Tyler's GONE.  Marla enters, shoes and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something on the junk strewn table. \nJACK (V.O.) I'm six years old again, passing messages between my parents. \nJACK I, uh... think you should go now. \nMarla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things, pushing other things off to the floor. \nJACK It's time for you to leave. \nMARLA Don't worry, I'm leaving. \nMarla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes.  She moves up into Jack's face. \nMARLA You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up. \nJACK Goodbye. \nShe laughs, spins on her heels.  As she exits the back door, she sings \"This Merry-Go-Round\" from \"Valley of the Dolls.\" Jack watches her through the kitchen window. \nTYLER (O.S.) Nice work. \nJack turns.  Tyler's right behind him.  Through the window, Marla can be seen walking away.  Tyler picks up the remnant of SOAP Jack's been using, holds it up to Jack. \nTYLER To make soap, first we have to render fat. \nJack looks at Tyler. \nCLOSE UP - SIGN: \"DANGER - BIOHAZARD.\" \nEXT. FENCED-IN BIOHAZARD WASTE DUMP SITE - NIGHT \nTyler stands inside the fence.  Jack's atop the fence, struggling to cross BARBED WIRE.  He wobbles, gets over, snags his shirt.  Jack falls, RIPPPPP.  Tyler helps. \nFOOTSTEPS.  A FLASHLIGHT BEAM.  Tyler pulls Jack behind a DUMPSTER, one of DOZENS.  A silhouette of a SECURITY GUARD moves along the perimeter, flashlight first.  He walks away. \nMOVE BACK to Tyler and Jack, who emerge from hiding.  Tyler eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster. \nTYLER The best fat for making soap -- because the salt balance is just right -- comes form human bodies... \nTyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS. \nJACK What is this place? \nTYLER A liposuction clinic. \nFrom the dumpster, Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized, thick plastic bag full of PINK GOO. \nTYLER Paydirt.  From society's richest asses and thighs. \nTIME CUT: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, carrying BAGS of fat.  One of Jack's bags RIPS, spilling the goo down the chain-link fench.  Jack slips and slides.  Tyler laughs. Tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nJack and Tyler each stir a boiling pot. \nTYLER As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts. \nJACK Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts. \nTYLER This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll mix it back in when we make the soap. \nTyler sticks a spoon into a pot, lifts up a scoop of the glycerin layer.  Then, he crabs a can, opens it. \nTYLER Lye -- the crucial ingredient. (adding lye to mix) Ancient peoples found their clothes got cleaner if they washed them at a certain spot in the river.  Why? Because, human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river. Year after year, bodies burnt.  Rain feel.  Water seeped through the wood ashes to become lye.  The lye combined with the melted fat of the bodies, till a thick white soapy discharge crept into the river. \nTyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet.  He takes Jack's hands and KISSES the back of it. \n", "test2_id": 367, "test3_input": "INT. JACK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAt the window, Tyler sips coffee, watches this scene on the PORCH below. \nJACK (V.O.) Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be. \nEXT. PORCH - MORNING \nRicky's there.  Bob is now next to him, in black, with a paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet.  Tyler steps out. Jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob.  To all the following questions, Ricky answers \"Sir!\" -- \nTYLER You have two black shirts?  Two pair black trousers?  One pair black boots?  Two pair black socks?  One black coat?  Three hundred dollars personal burial money?  Go inside. \nRicky goes in.  Tyler turns to Bob. \nTYLER You're too old.  Sorry.  And, you're too fat.  Nice seeing you. \nBob looks genuinely hurt.  He picks up his mattress and starts away.  Tyler looks at Jack and rolls his eyes.  Jack follows Bob... \nJACK Bob... Bob, wait... (leading Bob back) Let me explain this to you... \nEXT. PORCH -- NIGHT \nCRICKETS CHIRP.  Bob stands at at rigid attention. \nINT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT \nTyler and Jack stand in bathroom doorway, watching Ricky finish SHAVING off all of his HAIR.  Tyler comes to give the top of Ricky's head a sharp SLAP. \nTYLER A monkey, ready to be shot into space.  A Space Monkey, ready to sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem. \nFrom here on, all those with shaved heads: \"SPACE MONKEYS.\" \nEXT. PORCH - DAY \nJack looks out the window.  Bob stands motionless.  There's another \"applicant,\" a SHORT GUY, beside Bob.  Ricky comes out the front door with the BROOM... \nRICKY (to Bob) You're too fucking old, fatty!  We don't want your kind here! (to short guy) You're too short.  Go away, stumpy! Go back to the circus! \nRicky HITS them with the broom, then goes in, SLAMS THE DOOR. \nJACK (V.O.) So it went... \nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY \nTyler works with a HALF DOZEN SPACE MONKEYS, preparing the square of backyard.  They pull weeds, clear rocks; working with shovels, rakes, etc.  They cart away WHEELBARROWS of rocks and carry in SACKS of FERTILIZER. \nJACK (V.O.) Tyler built his army. \nIN THE KITCHEN WINDOW, Jack watches... \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nJack keeps watching out the window, eats toast. \nJACK (V.O.) To what purpose, might one ask? Well, one might ask, if not for the first rule of Project Mayhem. \nJack turns to look around the kitchen.  THREE SPACE MONKEYS work -- one SCRUBBING the FLOOR, one WASHING DISHES, one SCRUBBING the walls.  Jack walks out. \nJACK (V.O.) In Tyler We Trust. \nINT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY \nJack opens his eyes, awakening to sunlight thru the window. \nJACK (V.O.) And, then... \nINT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY \nJack slowly pushes open the door to Tyler's room... \nJACK Tyler... \nThe room is empty.  Jack stares. \nJACK (V.O.) He was gone. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nJack comes downstairs... finds DOZENS of SPACE MONKEYS. \nINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT \nJack enters.  Space Monkeys render fat and make soap.  They pinch HERBS, adding them to the mix.  They add VODKA.  Off to the side, a couple Monkeys stir a vat of RICE.  On the wall is a big bulletin board with HUNDREDS of DRIVER's LICENSES; a sign above it: \"HUMAN SACRIFICES.\" \nFRECKLED SPACE MONKEY \"You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.  You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else. We are all part of the same compost heap.\" \nJACK (V.O.) Planet Tyler. \nJack dips a spoon into the rice, chomps on it irritatingly. \nFRECKLED SPACE MONKEY \"We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.\" \nJack picks up a BOTTLE of VODKA. \nJACK (V.O.) I had to hug the walls, trapped inside this clockwork of Space Monkeys, cooking and working and sleeping in teams. \nINT. READING ROOM - NIGHT \nJack enters, vodka in hand.  TEN SPACE MONKEYS here, reading. \nJACK (V.O.) The house became a living thing, wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.  So many people moving, the house moved. \nJack walks out. \nINT. OFFICE - DAY \nJack enters.  Angel Face reads a book, marks on a chart. Space Monkeys shuffle PAPERS and NEWS CLIPPINGS.  Walls are lined with FILES, each labeled with a STREET ADDRESS, under SIGNS: \"Mischief,\" \"Disinformation,\" \"Arson.\" \nJack's eye lingers on \"Arson.\" He starts flipping through a file.  Angel Face comes to take the file from him. \nANGEL FACE That wouldn't interest you. \nJACK Where's Tyler? \nANGEL FACE The first rule of Project -- \nJACK Right, right. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT \nJack takes a swig of vodka, smokes.  In the BACKGROUND, a Space Monkey WHACKS an APPLICANT with a BROOM.  It's a ritual; no words.  Other Space Monkeys tend the garden. \nJACK (V.O.) I'm all alone.  I Am Jack's Broken Heart. \nJack drops his cigarette in the gravel, steps on it.  A Space Monkey immediately comes to clean it up. \nJACK Get away from me! \nMARLA'S VOICE (O.S.) Who are all these people? \nJack turns, sees Marla with an overnight bag. \nJACK The Paper Street Soap Company. \nMARLA Can I come in? \nJACK He's not here. \nMARLA What? \nJACK He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away! \nMarla stares at Jack, miserable.  A tear runs down her cheek.  She turns and walks away.  Jack watches her go. There's a LOUD COMMOTION from the house, VOICES SHOUTING. Jack heads to the back door... \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nJack enters.  Ricky crawls, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the LEG.  Space Monkeys begin a rudimentary job of treating the wound.  Other Space Monkeys carry in a DEAD BODY in BLACK CLOTHES and SKI MASK, putting it on the table. \nJACK What's going on? \nSpace Monkeys stare at the body.  The Mechanic, sweating, gets to his knees and pulls the ski mask off the corpse -- it's BOB, with a gunshot wound to the HEAD. \nJACK Bob... oh, Christ... \nJack pushes past a Space Monkey, stares down, stricken... \nJACK What... what happened... ? \nMECHANIC (out of breath) We were on assignment... \nEXT. SCULPTURE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nA SCULPTURE adorned with a giant GLOBE on top. \nMECHANIC (V.O.) We were supposed to kill two birds with one stone: \nA SERIES of EXPLOSIONS blasts the GLOBE free.  It ROLLS... \nMECHANIC (V.O.) A piece of corporate art... \nThe GLOBE ROLLS downhill, to the street -- rolling over one parked LUXURY CAR after another, crunching car roofs and causing windows to explode... \nMECHANIC (V.O.) ... and trash a trendy coffee bar. \nThen, the GLOBE arrives at the lobby of a HOTEL... BROADSIDES a limo, RICOCHETS... ROLLS directly into the front of a closed ARROSTO coffee bar, SMASHING windows... DECIMATING coffee push-pats... \nEXT. PARK - AERIAL VIEW - (FLASHBACK CONTINUOUS) \nBob, the Mechanic and Ricky FLEE, LAUGHING at their handiwork.  They split up, running O.S. \nMECHANIC (V.O.) We had it all worked out, man.  It went smooth... until... \nHARSH VOICE Police!  Freeze! \nO.S. SOUNDS of GUNSHOTS and FLASHES of MUZZLE FIRE. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - (RESUMING) \nThe Mechanic looks up from Bob's corpse. \nMECHANIC They shot Bob... they shot him in the head.  Those fuckers... \nJack walks away from Bob's corpse, distraught, holds his head, turns to look back, his eyes filling with tears. \nANOTHER SPACE MONKEY We gotta do something. \nRICKY We got to get rid of the evidence. We have to get rid of this body. \nANGEL FACE Bury him... \nJack looks around in disbelief. \nJACK What... ? \nANGEL FACE The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this! \nSeveral Space Monkeys gather around Bob's body. \nJACK No... ! \nSpace Monkeys stop.  Jack gets between them and Bob, SHOVES a few Space Monkeys back... \nJACK Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him! \nANGEL FACE He was killed in action. \nJACK No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things... \nANGEL FACE He was killed serving Project Mayhem. \nRICKY It's what he would have wanted, sir. \nJACK What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want? (wipes tears, points at Bob) This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine... \nRICKY But, this is Project Mayhem. \nJACK No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name... \nRICKY But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names. \nJACK No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson. \nRICKY Robert Paulson? \n", "test3_id": 368}

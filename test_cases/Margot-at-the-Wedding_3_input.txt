CLAUDE What's the Forum? 
MARGOT Like a cult. 
CLAUDE She was in a cult? 
MARGOT Years ago. She and Lenny also followed some guru who was a follower of the Mukdananda who made her drink his bath water. Who knows what she's doing now. INGRID (O.S.) Margot!   Claude! 44   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                          44 Claude hacks his way through the tall weeds. CLAUDE Wizard! We move past him, obscured by grass, Pauline and Ingrid yell: 
PAULINE/INGRID Wizard!    Wiz! 
Margot enters the frame.   The kids walk ahead. 
MARGOT Wizard!    Here, boy! 
She stands a few feet away from Pauline.   The kids can be heard shouting in the distance. 
MARGOT How long has he been gone? 
PAULINE I don't know. Ingrid brought him in last night, but we couldn't find him this morning. 
MARGOT Oh boy. 
PAULINE Did you tell Claude I'm pregnant? 
MARGOT I don't know. 
PAULINE You did. 
MARGOT I guess I said something. 
PAULINE You did. You don't have to tell him everything. 
MARGOT He wants to know. If I don't tell him, he figures it out. 
INGRID (O.S.) Where is Wizard? Ingrid approaches with Claude. PAULINE I don't know, honey. Ingrid sinks into her mother's body.   Claude and Margot walk ahead. 
CLAUDE You didn't let him go out into the road or something where something could've happened to him? 
MARGOT Why would you think I'd do something like that? That's awful. 
CLAUDE I just...    I'm just making sure. 
MARGOT That's a terrible thing to say to me. 
CLAUDE I didn't mean on purpose, I just meant maybe in case...you knew something. I'm sorry. 
45   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                         45 
Margot enters and opens the refrigerator. She gets out a white wine bottle. She turns around and jumps, startled. 
MARGOT Woa! 
Malcolm sits at the table, eating saltines out of the box, a pad and paper in front of him. 
MALCOLM Hey, sorry. I'm here. 
MARGOT No, I...    I should've looked. 
MALCOLM I'm just writing my vows. Trying to do something appropriate but also funny -- not jokey, more character based humor. Margot pours herself a glass of wine. She looks to Malcolm to see if he wants some. He shakes his head. She takes a long drink. Silence. MALCOLM You having an okay time? MARGOT Oh, yeah.    Besides Wizard getting -- 
MALCOLM Yeah, we'll...we'll find him...or else, I don't know... 
MARGOT We won't.

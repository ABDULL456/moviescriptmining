BEN It's obvious to anybody! The evidence is clear! (pause) Did you see Archibal's back? He didn't have to tell the truth. 
Dan Lewinson's dry laugh catches in his throat. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: LEWINSON That's what Stolz is saying to him right now in his torture room. CUT TO: 
INT. COURTROOM - AFTERNOON 
Advocate De Villiers and a dignified Emily in the witness stand. 
EMILY Captain Stolz lied. My husband never fight the police when he was arrested. They were rough with him, pushing him and threatening. DE VILLIERS When your husband's clothes were given to you, in what condition were they? EMILY There was blood on them and in the back pocket I found three broken teeth. DE VILLIERS Now Mrs. Ngubene, you have seen the note that's said to have been written by your husband. Do you recognize the writing? 
EMILY (firmly) That's not how my husband writes. (strongly) He never wrote that letter, they lie. 
DE VILLIERS Thank you, Mrs. Ngubene. MAGISTRATE Advocte Louw? 
He shakes his head. EMILY (facing the Magistrate and in firm voice) They killed my husband and son. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ON Ben, satisfied. 
MAGISTRATE (to a policeman next to Viljoen) Will you take the woman out? 
DE VILLIERS I'd like to call my last witness. Grace Nkosi. 
Grace's name is called. She is an attractive 20-years- old girl. As she passes by Ben, he watches her with concern; her face looks familiar. Of course he remembers having seen her at John Vorster Square the first time he went there to meet the colonel. GRACE NKOSI is the African girl the two security officers were lifted to the ten flour. He recognizes her. Grace Nkosi in the witness stand. She swears in Xhosa. DE VILLIERS Were you ever detained? GRACE Yes sir, at John Vorster Square. 
DE VILLIERS For how long? GRACE Six months. DE VILLIERS Can you tell us what happened to you during that time? GRACE I was interrogated by many special policemen, but mainly Captain Stolz and the one they call Venter. As they were searching somebody I know, they wanted me to tell them where that person was hidden. As I refuse to cooperate they beat me with a sjambok. After some time I fell and they kicked me in the face and stomach. 
ON Ben obviously shocked. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: GRACE I spot blood and they try to make me lick it. Then Captain Stolz threw a wet towel and started twisting it around my neck... (she illustrates) ... until I lost consciousness. They did this several time and the last one Captain Stolz said 'come on meid, speak up, or do you want to die like Gordon Ngubene?' A few days later I was released. ON Melanie taking notes. 
DE VILLIERS Thank you, Miss Grace. That's all, Your Worship. LOUW (rising and looking at Grace for some seconds) You made that up. Say you made it up. GRACE It's the truth. I have nothing more to say. Louw sits down. MAGISTRATE We shall adjourn until tomorrow morning. I'll hear the arguments and give the verdict. 
The crowd stands and starts to leave the courtroom. DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. COURTROOM - MORNING (SECOND DAY) A silent black crowd; Emily, Margaret, Stanley anxiously awaiting the verdict. Today the public gallery is more crowded than before. MAGISTRATE I wish to thank both advocates for conducting this case without rancour and in the best traditions of the South African legal profession. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ON Ben's face.    ON Dan Lewinson's face.   ON Viljoen and Stolz's faces. 
MAGISTRATE I have listened to all the evidence and the arguments. To begin with I have to say that there was no conclusive evidence offered to prove beyond doubt that members of the Security Police had been guilty of assault or any irregular conduct on the deceased. There were indications that Ngubene was aggressive and on more than one occasion had to be restrained with force. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that death had been caused by a trauma following pressure applied to the neck, consistent with hanging. Consequently, I find that Gordon Ngubene committed suicide by hanging himself and that on available evidence his death cannot be attributed to any act or omission or amounting to a criminal offense on the part of any person. 
CUT TO: Viljoen and Stolz smiling, shaking hands with Advocate Louw in congratulations. 
CUT TO: INT. FOYER OF COURTROOM - DAY 
The predominantly black crowd obviously dissatisfied with the verdict, discussing it as it moves slowly towards the main entrance. 
In the crowd Stanley, Margaret and Emily controlled, dignified but obviously pained. 
CUT TO: 
BEN totally depressed, walking up to Emily.

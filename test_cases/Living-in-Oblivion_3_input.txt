WANDA Hold it down, hold it down, people. Actors working. 
PALOMINO Great shirt, Wanda. 
WANDA (big smile) Why, thank you, Chad. 
NICK OK, let's work out the rest of this blocking. Wolf -- (notices Wolf's eyepatch) What happened to your eye? 
WOLF A little accident. 
NICK You going to be alright? 
WOLF I think so. 
PALOMINO It looks good on you, man. 
NICK Nicole is standing here, Chad, you're there by the chair. Camera is close on Ellen: her first line. 
NICOLE I've always admired you from afar. 
PALOMINO Admired? That sounds rather professional. 
NICK Good! "Professional," that's the cue; Damian steps up to the bed. Camera pulls back. The scene continues. 
NICOLE Well, then: loved. How does that sound? 
PALOMINO It sounds like the champagne talking. 
NICOLE I've loved you from the moment we met. 
PALOMINO Why didn't you tell me? 
NICOLE We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere. 
PALOMINO God. And all this time I thought... 
NICK Then the kiss. How's that feel? 
PALOMINO Great. 
NICK Nicole? 
NICOLE Good. 
NICK Wolf, any thoughts? 
WOLF Nope. 
PALOMINO I've got a thought. What about Damian having an eyepatch like Wolf's? 
NICK Let me think about that one, Chad. 
PALOMINO OK, you're the genius. Nick Reve, Living in Oblivion, Scene Six, Take One. Let's shoot it! 
NICK One second, Chad. You ready for one, Wolf? 
WOLF Hell, I been ready. 
PALOMINO Alright, Wolfman. 
NICK Good. Call it, Wanda. 
WANDA Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound. 
SOUND Speed! 
WANDA Roll camera! 
AC Rolling!

{"train": "Basic Instinct - by Joe Eszterhas BASIC INSTINCT \nby \nJOE ESZTERHAS \nINT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT \nIt is dark; we don't see clearly.  a man and woman make love on a brass bed.  There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling. On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine.  A tape deck PLAYS the Stones \"Sympathy for the Devil.\" \nAtop him... she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face. He cups her breasts.  She leans down, kisses him... \nJOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking.  We don't see the woman's face.  She has long blonde hair.  The CAMERA STAYS BEHIND and to the side of them. \nShe leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth...  she kisses him... she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms above his head. \nShe moves higher atop him... she reaches to the side of the bed... a white silk scarf is in her hand... her hips above his face now, moving... slightly, oh-so slightly... his face strains towards her. \nThe scarf in her hand... she ties his hands with it... gently... to the brass bed... his eyes are closed...  tighter... lowering hips into his face... lower... over his chest... his navel.  The SONG plays. \nHe is inside her... his head arches back... his throat white. \nShe arches her back... her hips grind... her breasts are high... \nHer back arches back... back... her head tilts back... she extends her arms... the right arm comes down suddenly...  the steel flashes... his throat is white... \nHe bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses... \nIt flashes up... it flashes down... and up... and down...  and up... and... \nEXT. A BROWNSTONE IN PACIFIC HEIGHTS - MORNING \nWinter in San Francisco cold, foggy.  Cop cars everywhere. The lights play through the thick fog.  Two Homicide detectives get out of the car, walk into the house. \nNICK CURRAN is 42.  Trim, good-looking, a nice suit; a face urban, edged, shadowed.  GUS MORAN is 64.  Crew-cut, silver beard, a suit rumpled and shiny, a hat out of the 50'sa face worn and ruined the face of a backwoods philosopher. \nINT. THE BROWNSTONE \nThere's money here -- deco, clean, hip -- That looks like a Picasso on the wall.  They check it out. \nGUS Who was this fuckin' guy? \nNICK Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz. \nGUS I never heard of him. \nNICK (grins) Before your time, pop. (a beat) Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now. \nGUS Not now he don't. \nPast the uniformed guys... nods... waves... past the forensic men... past the coroner's investigators... they get to the bedroom. \nINT. THE BEDROOM \nThey walk in, stare -- it's messy. \nIt's like a convention in here.  LT. PHIL WALKER, in his 50's, silver-haired, the Homicide guys; JIM HARRIGAN, late 40's, puffy, affable;  SAM ANDREWS, 30's, black.  A CORONER'S MAN is working the bed. \nLT. WALKER (to Nick and Gus) You guys know Captain Talcott? \nThey nod. \nGUS What's the Chief's office doin' here. \nCAPT. TALCOTT Observing. \nLT. WALKER (to the Coroner's Guy) What do you think, Doc? \nTHE CORONER'S GUY The skin blanches when I press it -- this kind of color is about right for six or eight hours. \nLT. WALKER Nobody say anything.  The maid came in an hour ago and found him. She's not a live-in. \nGUS Maybe the maid did it. \nLT. WALKER She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds. \nTHE CORONER'S GUY (deadpan) There are no bruises on his body. \nGUS (grins) It ain't the maid. \nLT. WALKER He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him. \nNICK (looks at body) What was it? \nTHE WOMAN Is he dead? \nNICK (after a beat) Why do you think he's dead? \nTHE WOMAN You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you? \nGUS Were you with him last night? \nTHE WOMAN You're looking for Catherine, not me. \nNICK Who are you? \nTHE WOMAN I'm Roxy. (a beat) I'm her -- friend. \nShe looks at them a beat. \nROXY She's out at the beach house at Stinson.  Seadrift.  1402. \nNICK Thanks. \nThey start to head out. \nROXY You're wasting your time. Catherine didn't kill him. \nA beat, they look at her, and go... \nEXT. SEADRIFT - STINSON BEACH - DAY \nFoggy.  Cold.  It is an expensive spit of land on the ocean. Multi-million dollar \"beach houses\" with gardens and swimming pools.  There are two Ferraris in the driveway -- one black, one white. \nThey get out of the car in front of the house.  They see a woman in back of the house, sitting on a deck chair, staring at the sea, a blanket around her.  As they get to her -- \nNICK Ms. Tramell? \nShe takes a long look a Nick, then looks away. \nCATHERINE TRAMELL is 30 years old.  She has long blonde hair and a refined, classically beautiful face.  She is not knockout gorgeous like Roxy; there is a smoky kind of sensuousness about her. \nNICK I'm De... \nCATHERINE (evenly) I know who you are. \nShe doesn't look at them.  She looks at the water. \nCATHERINE How did he die? \nGUS He was murdered. \nCATHERINE Really.  Maybe that's why you're from Homicide.  How? \nNick glances at Gus. \nNICK With an ice pick. \nShe closes her eyes a beat and then, still staring out, we see a thin smile.  They see it, too, and glance at each other. \nNICK How long were you dating him? \nCATHERINE I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him. \nThey glance at each other again. \nGUS What are you -- a pro? \nCatherine looks at him -- that thin smile again. \nCATHERINE No.  I'm an amateur. \nShe looks away. \nNICK How long were you having sex with him? \nCATHERINE About a year and a half. \nNICK Were you with him last night? \nCATHERINE Yes. \nNICK Did you leave the club with him? \nCATHERINE Yes. \nNICK Did you go home with him? \nNICK It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here? \nBETH (after a beat; smiles) Yes. \nNICK Thank you. \nAnd he starts heading out. \nBETH (behind him) I still miss you, Nick. \nHe doesn't even turn, pretends he didn't hear. \nINT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU \nHe walks in.  Gus Moran gets up from his desk as soon as he sees him. \nGUS Talcott's in there.  They're waiting. \nThey start heading for Lt. Walker's office. \nGUS How'd it go, son? \nNICK She misses me. \nGUS (grins) Hallelujah. \nINT. LT. WALKER'S OFFICE \nHe and Gus sit there with Lt. Walker, Harrigan, Andrews and Captain Talcott. \nHARRIGAN Sixteen stab wounds to the chest and neck.  No usable prints, no forcible entry, nothing missing. No prints on the ice pick, either -- it's available at any Safeway. The scarf is Hermes, expensive -- they sell about 20,000 a year worldwide. \nANDREWS The powder was cocaine, high- quality, high-content.  He inhaled it; there were minute quantities on his lips and penis.  Mr. Boz leaves five million dollars, no insurance, no direct survivors. He liked his coke, he liked his girls, and he liked rock and roll. \nNICK He liked the mayor, too, right? \nTalcott gives him a look. \nGUS What about his girlfriend? \nTALCOTT Is she relevant here?  I didn't know she was a suspect. \nLT. WALKER She's a suspect. \nTALCOTT On what basis? \nLT. WALKER (looks a notes) Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million. \nIt hangs there. \nNICK Are you kidding me? \nLT. WALKER (continues) Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased -- \nANDREWS Bobby Vasquez? \nLT. WALKER Bobby Vasquez, former middleweight contender, killed in the ring Atlantic City, 1984. \nNICK (smiles) I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads. \nLT. WALKER You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about? \nThey just stare at him. \nLT. WALKER It's about a retired rock and roll star who is murdered by his girlfriend. \nIt hangs there a long beat. \nINT. NICK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHis apartment is very bare -- very few things -- with wide open spaces.  There is a lot of chrome. \nHe sits on the couch, reading a book.  It is a paperback. \nWe see the title -- Love Hurts, by Catherine Adams.  He puts the book down a beat, then picks the phone up, dials. \nNICK Page 67, pop.  Do you know how she does the boyfriend?  With an icepick, in bed, his hands tied with a white silk scarf. \nINT. A POLICE DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nNick, Gus, Lt. Walker, Harrigan, Andrews, Captain Talcott -- and Beth Gardner.  With them is an older, white-haired man, DR. ANDREW LAMOTT.  There are copies of \"Love Hurts\" around the table. \nLT. WALKER Dr. Gardner? \nHe nods. \nCATHERINE Come in. \nINT. THE HOUSE \nIt is beautifully done in a Santa Fe motif.  She goes to a bedroom of the living room. \nNick sits down on a couch facing the bedroom she's walked into. Gus sits across from him, his back to the bedroom. \nThere is a coffee table between them.  She leaves the bedroom door halfway open. \nAn old newspaper is on the coffee table.  Nick reaches for it. The headline says VICE COP CLEARED IN TOURIST SHOOTINGS.  A headline underneath says GRAND JURY SAYS SHOOTINGS ACCIDENTAL. There is a photograph of Nick. \nHe stares at the paper. \nCATHERINE How long will this take? \nNick puts the paper down on the coffee table.  He is lost in his thoughts.  Gus picks the paper up. \nNICK (looks up) I don't know. \nNick, facing the half open bedroom door, sees a mirror near the wall of the bedroom.  The mirror reflects her in the other corner of the bedroom.  She is taking her clothes off.  He stares.  She strips down.  He sees her back. She has a beautiful body.  Naked, she puts a dress on.  She doesn't put any underwear on. \nNICK Do you always keep old newspapers around? \nCATHERINE Only when they make interesting reading. \nAnd she is suddenly out of the bedroom.  She stands there, smiles.  They look at each other a long beat. \nCATHERINE (finally) I'm ready. \nThey get up, head out. \nGUS You have the right to an attorney. \nCATHERINE Why would I need an attorney? \nINT. THE CAR - DAY \nThey sit in the front; she is in the back.  The car goes over the winding, two-lane Mt. Tamalpais road. \nThe fog is heavy.  It's starting to rain.  We see the beach far below. \nCATHERINE Do you have a cigarette? \nNICK I don't smoke. \nCATHERINE Yes, you do. \nNICK I quit. \nShe smiles, looks at him.  A beat, and he turns away.  Another beat, and she lights a cigarette up. \nNICK I thought you were out of cigarettes. \nCATHERINE I found some in my purse; would you like one? \nHe turns back to her. \nNICK I told you -- I quit. \nCATHERINE It won't last. \nA beat, as she looks at him, and then he turns away. \nGUS You workin' on another book? \nCATHERINE Yes I am. \nGUS It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time. \nHe watches her in the rearview mirror. \nCATHERINE It teaches you to lie. \nGUS How's that? \nCATHERINE You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief. \nGUS I like that.  \"Suspension of Disbelief.\" \nHe smiles at her in the mirror. \nNICK Sure. \nCATHERINE (smiles) Thanks. \nAnd he and Catherine walk away.  Gus and Walker watch them. \nINT. HIS CAR - NIGHT \nIt is an old, mint-condition silver Porsche.  It is pouring rain; the wind is blowing a San Francisco winter storm.  Nothing is said a long beat as he drives.  She yawns.  Stretches.  He looks at her. \nCATHERINE (smiles) I'm tired. \nNICK It's got to be tiring to beat that machine. \nShe looks at him and looks away.  A beat. \nCATHERINE If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all. \nNICK Why not? \nCATHERINE Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies. (a beat) For my writing. \nHe looks at her. \nCATHERINE (smiles) I love the rain, don't you? \nHe says nothing, doesn't look at her. \nCATHERINE You took a polygraph after you shot those two people, didn't you? \nHe looks at her now. \nNICK I passed. \nCATHERINE You see?  We're both innocent, Nick. \nHe pulls up in front of her house on Divisadero, stops.  He sees the white Ferrari in the driveway. \nNICK How do you know all this stuff about me? \nCATHERINE You know all about me. \nNICK I don't know anything that isn't police business. \nCATHERINE (after a beat) You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick? \nThey look at each other a beat. \nCATHERINE (smiles) Thanks for the ride. \nAnd she's out of the car.  He watches her as she hurries in the rain -- his eyes on her until the moment she opens the door and is inside. \nINT. THE TEN-FOUR - NIGHT \nIt is a police bar, San Francisco style.  Ferns  Joe Montana and Will Clark posters.  The jukebox has a lot of Tony Bennett. \nHe walks in.  He sees Lt. Walker at a back booth with Gus, goes to them, sits down. \nLT. WALKER What is all this \"Nick\" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride. \nNICK She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody. \nLT. WALKER And you volunteered. \nA BARTENDER stays behind the bar, but yells to him. \nTHE BARTENDER Perrier, Nick? \nNICK Double Black Jack rocks, Harry. \nGUS (with concern) What you doin', son? \nNICK It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop? (to Lt. Walker) She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her. \nTHE BARTENDER Here you go, Nick. \nHe gets up, gets his drink -- \nNICK Thanks, Harry. \nHe sits back down.  He takes a big slug.  They watch him. \nLT. WALKER You sure? \nNICK You want to get out of here? \nShe looks at him a beat. \nBETH (smiles) Yes. \nAt the booth, Gus and Lt. Walker watch the two of them leave. \nGUS Maybe it's for old-time's sake. \nLT. WALKER (watches them go out) Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs. \nGUS (after a beat, smiles) He ain't that way.  He's got heart. \nLT. WALKER (smiles) Yeah.  I know. \nINT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nHe is kissing her -- hard, rough.  He forces her against the wall. \nBETH Don't -- please, Nick -- \nWe hear her dress RIP.  He kisses her harder -- we hear her panties RIP.  He gets the dress off, pushes his hands under her bra -- \nBETH Please don't -- don't -- \nHe puts his mouth to her shoulder, bites it -- as they move down to the floor. \nINT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - LATER \nIt is dark.  The are still partially dressed.  They are on the floor.  He lies on his back, staring at the ceiling. \nShe lies next to him -- the torn dress wound around her. \nThere is a bite mark on her shoulder.  A long beat, silence -- then -- \nBETH What was she like? \nNICK Who? \nBETH Catherine Tramell. \nNICK (after a beat) She said what you said she'd say. \nShe sits up, looks away.  He looks at her, puts his finger on the bite mark idly, gently.  A beat, and he kisses her shoulder gently, then lies back down. \nBETH I met her at Berkeley. \nHe looks at her. \nBETH We were in some of the same classes. \nNICK (after a beat) Why didn't you tell me? \nShe looks at him. \nBETH I'm telling you. \nThey look at each other a long beat. \nBETH (with difficulty) You've never been... like that... before. \nHe says nothing, looks away from her. \nBETH Why? \nHe doesn't look at her a long beat, says nothing. \nNICK You're the shrink. \nShe keeps looking at him.  He won't look at her. \nBETH You weren't making love to me. \nA beat; he looks at her. \nNICK Who was I making love to? \nShe looks at him a long beat. \nBETH You weren't making love. \nThey look at each other, a long beat, then away.  He lies back down.  Beth doesn't look at him, keeps sitting up. \nRoxy stands there, staring at them.  Her hair is up.  She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a black T-shirt, and black jeans and cowboy boots. \nCATHERINE (brightly) Hiya, hon.  You two have met, haven't you? \nRoxy looks at Nick.  Catherine goes to her, kisses her briefly on the lips, stands there with her arm around her --both of them looking at Nick. \nHe walks by them, opens the door to go, his face a mask. \nCATHERINE You're going to make a terrific character, Nick. \nHe doesn't look at her; he's gone. \nINT. BETH GARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY \nHe comes in.  He looks like he's going to kill someone.  A RECEPTIONIST sits there. \nRECEPTIONIST She's on the phone -- she'll be right with you, detective --He sweeps by her into Beth's inner office.  She hangs up when she sees the look on his face. \nNICK Who has access to my file? \nBETH What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you? \nNICK Who's got access to my goddamn file? \nShe gets up -- he goes closer to her; she backs away from him. \nBETH Nobody. \nHe goes closer to her; she backs away. \nBETH It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall. \nNICK Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me. \nShe says nothing, looks scared. \nNICK (suddenly) It's Internal Affairs, isn't it? \nBETH No, Nick, please -- \nNICK (loud, hard) Who? \nBETH (blurts it) Nilsen. \nINT. THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION - DAY \nHe storms into the big room.  He sees MARTY NILSEN.  He is sitting behind his desk in his glass-enclosed office inside this big room.  About a dozen plainclothes policemen are in the big room.  He goes by them into Nilsen's office. \nINT. MARTIN NILSEN'S OFFICE \nHe closes the door.  Nilsen sees the look on his face, backs his chair away towards the wall. \nNILSEN What do you want, Curran? \nHe goes to him, picks him up by his lapels, slams him against the wall. \nNICK (out of control) You sold her the file, didn't you? \nNILSEN (scared) What are you talking about? \nNICK (out of control) What'd she pay you? \nHe slams him against the wall again.  The glass EXPLODES behind them -- a chair comes into the room.  Nick is frozen, holding Nilsen by the throat against the wall. \nONE OF THE I.A. GUYS Let him go, Curran.  Nice and easy. \nHe looks back, sees two Internal Affairs men with their guns drawn, pointed at him.  A beat, and he lets Nilsen go.  He turns calmly and starts to walk out. \nNILSEN You're on sick leave, Shooter.  As of right now.  Pending the outcome of a psychiatric evaluation. \nEXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK \nHe gets into his old Porsche.  He STARTS the car up.  Gus Moran comes up to the window.  They look at each other a \nGUS What's goin' down, son? \nNICK Nothin' (a beat) I'll be okay, pop. \nThey look at each other a long beat. \nGUS No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge. \nNICK (after a long beat) I got tired of being played with. \nNick stares at Nilsen's body.  They watch him. \nLT. WALKER Give me your gun, Nick. \nA beat, and then Nick gives him his gun.  Walker smells it, shakes his head, gives it to one of the Internal Affairs men. \nNICK (to Walker) You think I -- \nGUS I don't son, but I got the minority opinion. \nINT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nHe sits in the same room that Catherine sat in --surrounded by four or five Internal Affairs men, Lt. \nWalker, Gus, and Captain Talcott.  Lt. Walker and Gus sort of sit back -- I.A. is running the investigation.  The same police stenographer -- the same plain young woman -- is sitting in the room who was there with Catherine. \nNICK Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper. \nAN I.A. MAN Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone? \nNICK (after a beat) No. \nBeth Gardner comes into the room.  They look at her. \nAN I.A. MAN We'll speak to you afterwards, Dr. Gardner. \nNick gives her a look. \nBETH I'd like to sit-in if you don't mind. \nTHE I.A. MAN I'd really rather -- \nTALCOTT I don't see anything wrong with Dr. Gardner sitting-in if Detective Curran doesn't object. \nNick looks at her, shrugs. \nAN I.A. MAN Where were you tonight? \nNICK Home. Watching TV. \nAN I.A. MAN All night? \nNICK Yeah. \nAN I.A. MAN Were you drinking? \nHe looks at Beth. \nNICK Yeah, I was drinking. \nAN I.A. MAN When did you start drinking again? \nNICK (after a beat) A couple days ago. \nBETH I saw Detective Curran at his apartment around ten o'clock.  He was sober and lucid.  I asked him in my capacity as his departmental therapist about his altercation with Lt. Nilsen.  He expressed regret and displayed no hostility. \nAN I.A. MAN (to Beth) How long were you at his apartment? \nBETH About fifteen minutes.  I saw there was no reason for my concern and left. \nShe and Nick look at each other.  He looks away and lights a cigarette. \nAN I.A. MAN There's no smoking in this building. \nNICK (after a beat) What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking? \nIt is the exact line that Catherine used.  A long beat. \nLT. WALKER I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him? \nNICK No. \nThey look at him a beat. \nNICK Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that. \nAN I.A. MAN Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi. \nLT. WALKER Like writing a book about killing a guy gets you off the hook for killing him. \nAN I.A. MAN (to Walker) I don't understand.  What are you talking about?  What book? \nLT. WALKER (to Nick) Private joke. \nNICK You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it. (he smiles) She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it. \nLt. Walker looks at him a long beat. \nLT. WALKER She's screwing with your head, Nick.  Pretty soon you're gonna look in the mirror and think you're seeing her. \nEXT. HIS APARTMENT \nIt is in the Marina District; on a street like Cervantes. \nHe gets out of his old Porsche; he sees her black Ferrari there. She is sitting on the front stoop.  She wears an Indian jacket, jeans and a T-shirt.  He goes up to her. She looks at him a beat. \nCATHERINE I heard about what happened.  What good's a shooter without his gun? \nShe smiles. \nNICK (a beat) How exactly did you hear? \nCATHERINE (after a beat) I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends. \nNICK (after a beat) I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend. \nCATHERINE (smiles) I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me. \nNICK (after a beat) I like you. \nCATHERINE Do you? \nNICK (smiles) Yeah.  Would you like to come up and have a drink? \nShe looks at him a beat. \nCATHERINE I didn't think you'd ask me. \nHe looks at her a beat. \nNICK (smiles) I'm not that easy to figure. \nThey start walking inside.  She walks ahead of him.  He watches her.  She turns suddenly. \nCATHERINE You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring. \nNICK (after a beat) Don't get too cocky. \nCATHERINE Why not? \nNICK You can make a mistake. \nCATHERINE (smiles) Not me. \nAnd she turns, heads inside; he follows her. \nINT. HIS APARTMENT - DAY \nThey walk in.  She looks at the bareness of the place. \nCATHERINE You should put some warmth into it.  You don't want it to reflect on your personality. \nShe turns, smiles at him.  He looks at the bottle of Jack Daniel's; there's not much left. \nNICK Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be. \nCATHERINE Fine. \nNICK Ice? \nCATHERINE (smiles) Please. \nThere is a palpable tension between them. \nHe takes the ice out, opens a drawer, takes out an icepick. \nCATHERINE Let me do that.  You like to watch me doing it, don't you? \nShe smiles; a beat and he hands her the icepick.  She takes it, starts to us the icepick, her back to him.  He lights a cigarette. \nCATHERINE Can I have a cigarette, please?  I told you you'd start smoking again. \nHe watches her working on the ice. \nCATHERINE Light it for me, will you? \nHe does, steps to her.  She parts her lips -- he puts it on her lip, watches it.  Their eyes are on each other. \nNICK How's your new book? \nCATHERINE I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character. \nThey look at each other a long beat. \nCATHERINE Thanks for the drink. \nHe nods, say nothing as she goes to the door -- \nCATHERINE I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me. (a beat) I'm going down to Johnny's club. \nNICK (after a beat) I'll meet you there. \nShe looks at him a long beat; and she's gone. \nINT. THE STAIRWAY \nAs she is going down the stairs, Gus Moran is coming up. \nHe does a real double-take as he goes by her. \nCATHERINE (smiles) Hi, Gus. \nHe looks at him a long beat, and he goes upstairs, into Nick's apartment. \nINT. NICK'S APARTMENT \nNick stands at the window, watching her outside.  A long beat, and he looks at Gus. \nGUS (after a beat) Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass? \nNICK (after a beat) She want to play?  Fine.  I can play. \nGUS (after a beat) Everybody that she plays with dies. \nNICK (after a beat, quietly) I know what that's like. \nINT. JOHNNY BOZ'S CLUB - NIGHT \nIt is dark, cavernous there are a thousand people in here. The MUSIC is ear-splitting, pulsing.  Lights flash. \nThe floor is huge.  At one time, this club was a church. \nHe walks around the sides, a drink in his hand, looking for her.  He doesn't see her. \nThe he catches a glimpse of Roxy.  She is dancing with another woman.  He watches her.  She is wearing pants and a jacket, her hair off to the side.  She looks very masculine tonight. \nRoxy laughs at the other woman, leaves her on the floor, starts moving through the sea of dancers.  He follows her through the press of bodies.  She goes towards the men's room.  She walks in. \nINT. THE MEN'S ROOM \nIt is large, dark, shadowy It was once the sacristy. \nA crowd scene men and women. Roxy presses through them. \nA haze of crack smoke; we see people doing poppers. \nShe opens the door to a toilet stall, walks in.  Nick is behind her.  As the door opens, he sees Catherine. \nShe wears a black motorcycle jacket, a very short skirt, stiletto heels.  Her hair is up.  He make-up is severe,  In the darkness, in the shadows she looks about 19.  A hot 19. \nA hot flash-trash 19. \nShe is in there with two men -- one of them is a big, body- built black guy.  She has a vial of something near her face. \nShe sees Nick watching her.  She whispers something to the tall black guy.  He looks at Nick, smiles a condescending smile. The door to the stall closes \nINT. THE CLUB \nHe is walking along the side, watching the floor, a drink in his hand.  The song ends and it seques right into the Stones's \"Miss You.\" \nHe sees her.  Her black leather jacket is off. \nShe wears a very tight, flimsy top, the short skirt, the heels. She is dancing with Roxy and the black guy.  He watches her move... watches her body. \nShe turns, sees him, dances, watches him... gets between Roxy and the black guy... they sandwich her with their bodies... keeps moving, turning... eyes on him... playing to him with her body.  He watches. \nA long beat, and he goes up to them.  His movements are \nalmost trance-like.  They look at each other.  A long beat. \nCatherine stops dancing.  he reaches for her.  She moves away.

HER STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY \nA cold and foggy day.  He gets out of his old Porsche, walks down the driveway.  He sees her out on the beach by the water. A small bonfire is near her.  He walks towards her. \nRoxy watches him, expressionless, from an upstairs window of the house.  He doesn't see her. \nHe walks up to Catherine.  She has an Indian blanket over her and is wearing a black felt English derby hat, her hair loose underneath. \nNICK (expressionless) 'Morning. \nShe doesn't look at him -- he smiles slowly.  She doesn't smile and she doesn't seem to like his smile, either.  She walks along the beach.  He walks with her.  A long beat. \nNICK I think Roxy got jealous. \nShe looks at him.  He looks like he is trying to hide a smile. \nCATHERINE (after a beat) She's seen me fuck plenty of other guys. \nThat wipes the hidden smile off his face.  He looks at her, walks with her.  A long beat. \nNICK Maybe she saw something she didn't see before. \nCATHERINE She's seen everything before. \nShe looks at him; he's smiling now. \nNICK She's never seen us before. \nHe's serious.  She looks at him.  She smiles slowly. \nCATHERINE Did you think it was so special? \nNICK I told her it was the fuck of the century. \nHe can't hide his smile anymore.  She says nothing, keeps walking. \nNICK (after a beat) What did you think? \nCATHERINE I thought it was a pretty good beginning. \nThey look at each other.  They keep walking.  A long beat. \nNICK How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too? \nCATHERINE (after a beat) Do you want her to join us sometime? \nHe looks at her: she's serious. \nNICK I didn't mean for me -- I meant for you. \nShe looks at him. \nCATHERINE I'm not as judgmental about women as I am about men. \nThey keep walking.  A long beat. \nNICK How's your shoulder? \nCATHERINE Fine.  How's your back? \nNICK It hurts. \nShe stops, looks at him.  A long beat. \nCATHERINE We're alike, you know. \nA beat, he looks at her -- \nNick pours him more coffee; Gus guzzles it. \nGUS (loud) How could you fuck her? \nIt gets some looks from the other people in her -- Nick shushes him, pours him more coffee.  He drinks it. \nGUS (quietly) You wanna die, son?  What is it -- those goddamn tourists -- you still feel so bad about that you're wigglin' your way into an icepi -- (suddenly louder) We got too many goddamn tourists comin' here anyway -- plenty more goddamn tourists where they goddamn came from. \nSome people here really give him the looks now.  Gus looks angrily away from them, drinks more coffee. \nNICK (after a beat; quietly) I'm not afraid of her. \nGUS (loud) Why the hell not? \nNICK I don't know.  I'm just not. \nGUS (loud) That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head. \nGUS (smiles; to Nick) It ain't your brain. \nThey look at each other a long beat.  Gus drinks more coffee. He sits back, pulls his cowboy hat over his eyes. \nA long beat. \nGUS (quietly) I.A. done did a track on Lt. Martin D for Dickhead Nilsen.  They found a safety deposit box with fifty- thousand dollars in it, taken out three months ago, used that one time. \nHe looks at the fat woman again -- leers at her obscenely. \nShe looks away. \nNICK (after a long beat) It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago. \nGUS Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle. \nNick looks at him and smiles a thin smile; he's not there, he's completely preoccupied. \nINT.

I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car. \nAnd he steps on the gas and ROARS out of there, forcing Nick to get out of the way.  Nick looks after him a long beat, shakes his head. \nINT. A CAR - NIGHT \nSomeone is following him slowly as he walks down the street.

THE STREET \nThe Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping them, looking almost out of control, its MOTOR screaming. \nINT. THE PORSCHE \nHe sees the Ferrari turn ahead.  When he gets to where it turned, he turns wildly. \nEXT. THE STREET \nThe Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche is gaining ground behind it, making turns. \nINT. THE PORSCHE \nThe Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a road going up a hillside.  He yanks the wheel hard. \nNick gives him a look: What did he think he was going to do -- stand there? \nHe sits down, looks at them.  A beat, as they look at him, then -- \nDR. MCELWAINE (courtly) Nick -- when you recollect your childhood, are your recollections pleasing to you? \nNick looks at them a long beat in disbelief. \nNICK (calmly, directly) Number one I don't remember how often I used to jack off, but it was a lot.  Number two I didn't get pissed off at my dad -- even after I was old enough to know what he and mom were doing in the bedroom.  Number three I don't look in the toilet before I flush it.  Number four I don't wet the bed and haven't for some time. Number five You can go fuck yourselves because I'm out of here. \nINT. THE CORRIDOR \nHe is walking away quickly.  Beth is with him, trying to keep up.  She is very angry. \nBETH What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you? \nNICK I don't need any help. \nBETH Yes you do.  Something's on with you. (a beat) You're sleeping with her, aren't you? \nA beat, he stops looks at her, then keeps walking. \nNICK What is this interest you've got in her? \nBETH My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates -- \nNICK I thought you hardly know her. \nBETH I know the type.  I'm a psychologist. \nHe stops, looks at her. \nNICK (after a beat) That means you manipulate people too, doesn't it, Beth?  You're a practicing psychologist -- that means you're better at it than she is. \nShe looks at him a long beat. \nBETH (quietly) I feel sorry for you, Nick. \nA beat, and she turns and walks away. \nEXT. ROAD TO STINSON HOUSE - DAY \nNick is driving down winding road to Stinson house.  He is driving very fast, passing other cars on the winding and twisting road. \nINT.

He walks over to her. \nCATHERINE (near tears) I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you. (a beat) I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she? \nNICK (a beat) Did you like her to watch? \nCATHERINE (a long beat) Do you think I told her to kill You? \nNICK (softly, with intensity) No. \nCATHERINE (after a beat, near tears) Everybody that I care about dies. \nShe is about to break into uncontrolable sobbing.  Nick puts his arms around her. \nNICK (soothing) It's OK.  It's OK. \nCATHERINE (quietly, almost begging) Make love to me. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThey are seen rolling and turning around on each other. \nTheir love making is sensual, sincere. \nLater in bed. \nNICK (calmly, but seriously) Do you think she killed Johnny Boz? \nCATHERINE (surprised, startled) For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me. \nNICK (a beat) Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too. \nCATHERINE (after a beat) No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.

We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer. \nGUS What was the motive? \nTHE WOMAN She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.

THE CLOVERDALE POLICE DEPARTMENT \nThey are going to their cars, parked side by side.  The Porsche looks pretty badly banged up. \nGUS It sure makes you wonder what they talked about when they set themselves down in front of the campfire at night.

You dyed your hair blonde. \nA long beat as they look at each other. \nBETH I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too. \nNICK (after a beat) Did you know Noah Goldstein? \nBETH I had him in two classes. \nNICK You saw all the reports, Beth! \nPhil had you copied.  You never said anything! \nBETH (after a beat) What do I say -- Hey, listen, guys, I'm not gay, but I did fuck your suspect. (she turns away) I was embarrassed.  It's the only time I've been with a woman. \nShe turns to him. \nBETH She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.

She told me about Lisa Henderson. \nBETH She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?

What about Nilsen?  What possible motive would I have to kill him? \nGus thinks about it. \nGUS She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is. \nNICK She's a writer -- it's part of what she does. \nGUS (irate) Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes. (a beat) There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened. \nNICK I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened. \nGUS (after a beat, quietly) You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got.

WALKER Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook. \nNICK Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him. \nCATHERINE Yes it does, doesn't it? \nShe holds his eyes a second, then -- \nCATHERINE The answer is no.

Either she's telling the truth or I've never met anyone like her. \nA long beat, then -- \nLT. WALKER Well, I guess that's it. \nA long beat, Nick watches her as she sits inside. \nNICK How does somebody beat this machine? \nTHE EXAMINER Ninety-nine point nine percent of the cases, they don't.  You'd have to be able to mask the truth from your own central nervous system, your circulatory system, your adrenal glands.  In my opinion, this woman is telling the truth. \nThe Examiner walks away.  They stand there. Catherine stands at the door of the cubicle behind them -- \nCATHERINE Can I go now? \nLT.

A beat, and she turns to go in. \nINT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE \nShe goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside.  He watches her body.  His movements are tentative, off-balance.  She turns the Stones DOWN. \nOn a table by the window, he sees a word processor.  Spread around it are newspaper clippings.  They are all about him. \nWe see the headline on one KILLER COP TO FACE POLICE REVIEW. She sees him glancing at the clips. \nCATHERINE I'm using you for my detective. In my book.  You don't mind, do you? \nShe smiles.  He looks at her, expressionless. \nCATHERINE Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one. \nNICK No, thanks. \nShe goes to the bar. \nCATHERINE (smiles) That's right.  You're off the Jack Daniels too, aren't you? \n", "test2_true": "NICK I'd like to ask you a few more questions. \nCATHERINE I'd like to ask you some, too. \nShe turns to him, icepick in hand, smiles. \nCATHERINE For my book. \nShe turns back to the ice, works on it with the pick.  She raises her arm, plunges it.  Raises it, plunges it.  He watches her. \nNICK (wary) What kind of questions? \nShe puts the icepick down, pours herself a drink, turns to him. \nCATHERINE How does it feel to kill someone? \nHe looks at her a long beat. \nNICK (finally) You tell me. \nCATHERINE I don't know.  But you do. \nTheir eyes are on each other. \nNICK (finally) It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire. \nCATHERINE Four shootings in five years.  All accidents. \nNICK (after a long beat) They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop. \nA long beat, as they look at each other. \nNICK Tell me about Professor Goldstein. \nBEAT. \nCATHERINE There's a name from the past. \nNICK You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins? \nShe looks at him a long beat, sips her drink, never takes her eyes off him. \nCATHERINE Noah was my counselor in my freshman year. (she smiles) That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works. (a beat) Hazel is my friend. \nNICK She wiped out her whole family. \nCATHERINE Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse. \nNICK Didn't you study it in school? \nCATHERINE Only in theory. (she smiles) You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice. \nHe stares at her a long beat. \nCATHERINE (quietly) What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much? \nNICK (after a beat) No. \nHe stares at her, almost horrified. \nCATHERINE (quietly) Tell me about the coke, Nick.  The day you shot those two tourists -- how much coke did you do? \nShe steps closer to him. \nCATHERINE Tell me, Nick. \nShe puts her hand softly on his cheek,  He grabs her hand roughly, holds it. \nNICK I didn't. \nCATHERINE Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew. \nThey are face to face.  He is still holding her roughly by the hand. \nCATHERINE Your wife knew, didn't she?  She knew what was going on.  Nicky got too close to the flame.  Nicky liked it. \nHe twists her arm back behind her -- their bodies are pressed against each other -- their eyes digging into each other. \nCATHERINE (in a whisper) That's why she killed herself? \nHe is twisting her arm, staring at her, pulling her against him.  We hear the DOOR behind them.  A beat, and he lets her go, turns away from her. \n", "test3_input": "LT. WALKER (quietly) Jesus. \nINT. BETH GARDNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nNick with Lt. Walker.  Nick looks like a zombie.  Andrews comes up to them.  He has a gun in his hands. \nANDREWS Thirty-eight caliber revolver. \nBottom drawer, bureau in the bedroom. \nLT. WALKER Have  ballistics check it for Nilsen. \nHarrigan comes out. \nHARRIGAN Lieutenant, you'd better come in here. \nLt. Walker goes into the kitchen.  Nick follows him. \nThere are several cops around a kitchen cabinet.  A drawer is open. \nWalker looks -- we look with him.  We see a copy of Love hurts, Catherine's paperback book, and a stack of photos of Catherine. \nWalker picks the photos up, goes through them -- we see shots of Catherine in college -- Catherine at a fight --Catherine with Johnny Boz -- Catherine with Roxy. \nHe hands the photos to Nick. \nNick stares at them. \nLT. WALKER I guess that's it. \nINT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT \nNick sits, his feet up.  He looks like a zombie.  With him are Lt. Walker, Andrews, and Captain Talcott.  We see other plainclothesmen in the b.g. -- a flurry of activity, people on phones.  A long beat. \nLT. WALKER She must've heard you on the stairway and dumped the stuff. \nNick says nothing, stares off. \nA DETECTIVE comes over to them. \nDETECTIVE There was no suite 405 in that building.  Catherine Tramell's roommate in her freshman year is dead.  She died of leukemia two years ago. \nAn INTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN comes over to them. \nINTERNAL AFFAIRS MAN Our files on Dr. Gardner show nothing about a police report in Berkeley -- nothing related to Salinas, either. \nA long beat -- the phone RINGS.  Andrews picks it up, listens. \nANDREWS Thanks. \nHe hangs up. \nANDREWS Ballistics says the .38 we found in her apartment matches Nilsen. No registration.  They're checking with Salinas.  The icepick is the same brand and model as the Boz weapon. \nA long beat -- Nick just stares. \nHarrigan comes up to them. \nHARRIGAN We checked the tape machines at Dr.  Gardner's apartment and at her office -- both here and the one on Van Ness.  No message from Gus on any of 'em.  The one at her apartment was broken. (a beat) Johnny Boz's psychiatrist says he thinks he remembers Dr. Gardner and Boz meeting at a Christmas party at his house a year ago. \nA long beat. \nLT. WALKER (after a long beat, sadly) You just can't tell about people, can you.  Even the ones you think you know inside-out. \nHe and Nick look at each other a beat. \nCAPTAIN TALCOTT Congratulations, Curran. \nNick looks at him, expressionless. \nEXT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHe parks his car.  It is dark.  Foggy. \nHe starts heading inside. \nINT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHe goes in.  He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see him walking up several flights of steps. \nINT. THE CORRIDOR TO HIS APARTMENT \nHe opens his door with his key. \n", "test3_true": "He walks in.  The apartment is dark. \nA VOICE (behind him) Hi. \nIt is a whisper, almost a hiss.  He spins, fast.  Catherine stands there, pressing herself against a wall.  They look at each other a long beat.  She looks like she is almost in a trance. \nCATHERINE I heard about it... on TV. \nHe looks at her, expressionless.  A long beat, their eyes are into each other.  She looks like she is almost shivering. \nCATHERINE I can't allow myself to care about you -- I can't allow myself to care -- I can't -- I can't -- \nShe looks very emotional.  He moves towards her, puts his arms around her, holds her very close. \nCATHERINE (in a whisper) I don't want to do this -- please -- I don't want to do this -- I lose everybody -- I don't want to lose you -- I don't want to -- \nHe presses her closer and closer to himself, holds her. \nINT. HIS BEDROOM - NIGHT \nIt is dark; we can't see clearly. \nAtop her... he makes love to her... gently... tenderly... hardly moving inside her... there are tears in her eyes... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER \nAtop him... she is on her knees, straddling him... he is on his back, his eyes are closed... her head arches back...  her breasts high... he strains toward her with his body...  she holds her arms high... her right hand is in a fist... \n(we only see the back of her hand and arm)... it comes down suddenly... he bucks... writhes... then her whole body falls on top of him. \nA very long beat... \nWe can't see him... her body completely covers him... \nAnd then finally he moves... turns her to the side...  kisses her. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HIS BEDROOM - LATER \nThe Stones play \"Sympathy For The Devil\"  in the b.g.; the MUSIC is low. \nThey lie next to each other on the bed.  The CAMERA faces them. He lies, staring at the ceiling, on the left side of the bed, smoking a cigarette.  She is curled away from him toward the right side of the bed.  A long beat, then -- \nCATHERINE What do we do now, Nick? \nNICK (after a long beat) We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after. \nWe see her right arm go to the side of the bed and then over. He stares at the ceiling. \nCATHERINE I hate rugrats. \nNICK (after a long beat) We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after. \nWe see from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now Her face is expressionless.  Her right arm dangles over the right side of the bed.  Her right hand is clenched.  Is she holding something in it against her arm? \nWe see them from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now: He turns his body away from her to put out his cigarette. \nWe see her behind him slowly turning towards him and the CAMERA. A beat, and he turns towards her. \nThey look at each other.  A long beat as the SONG gets louder. We see them in CLOSEUP.  We don't see her right arm. \nCATHERINE (in a whisper) I love you. \nA beat, and he kisses her.  The CAMERA BACKS AWAY from them slowly to the right side of the bedroom as they kiss, and we -- \nFADE TO BLACK \n... A long beat, as the SONG keeps playing... and we... \nFADE IN: \nWe see them from the right side of the bedroom.  And then the CAMERA LOWERS SLOWLY as they kiss with more and more passion. \nIt keeps going LOWER. \nThere is something under the bed.  The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER towards it as \"SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL\" plays louder.  We see it now in CLOSEUP as the bed rustles above... \nIt is a thin, steel-handled icepick. \n"}

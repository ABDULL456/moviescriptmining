{"train": "NICK It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here? \nBETH (after a beat; smiles) Yes. \nNICK Thank you. \nAnd he starts heading out. \nBETH (behind him) I still miss you, Nick. \nHe doesn't even turn, pretends he didn't hear. \nINT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU \nHe walks in.  Gus Moran gets up from his desk as soon as he sees him. \nGUS Talcott's in there.  They're waiting. \nThey start heading for Lt. Walker's office. \nGUS How'd it go, son? \nNICK She misses me. \nGUS (grins) Hallelujah. \nINT. LT. WALKER'S OFFICE \nHe and Gus sit there with Lt. Walker, Harrigan, Andrews and Captain Talcott. \nHARRIGAN Sixteen stab wounds to the chest and neck.  No usable prints, no forcible entry, nothing missing. No prints on the ice pick, either -- it's available at any Safeway. The scarf is Hermes, expensive -- they sell about 20,000 a year worldwide. \nANDREWS The powder was cocaine, high- quality, high-content.  He inhaled it; there were minute quantities on his lips and penis.  Mr. Boz leaves five million dollars, no insurance, no direct survivors. He liked his coke, he liked his girls, and he liked rock and roll. \nNICK He liked the mayor, too, right? \nTalcott gives him a look. \nGUS What about his girlfriend? \nTALCOTT Is she relevant here?  I didn't know she was a suspect. \nLT. WALKER She's a suspect. \nTALCOTT On what basis? \nLT. WALKER (looks a notes) Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million. \nIt hangs there. \nNICK Are you kidding me? \nLT. WALKER (continues) Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased -- \nANDREWS Bobby Vasquez? \nLT. WALKER Bobby Vasquez, former middleweight contender, killed in the ring Atlantic City, 1984. \nNICK (smiles) I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads. \nLT. WALKER You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about? \nThey just stare at him. \nLT. WALKER It's about a retired rock and roll star who is murdered by his girlfriend. \nIt hangs there a long beat. \nINT. NICK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHis apartment is very bare -- very few things -- with wide open spaces.  There is a lot of chrome. \nHe sits on the couch, reading a book.  It is a paperback. \nWe see the title -- Love Hurts, by Catherine Adams.  He puts the book down a beat, then picks the phone up, dials. \nNICK Page 67, pop.  Do you know how she does the boyfriend?  With an icepick, in bed, his hands tied with a white silk scarf. \nINT. A POLICE DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nNick, Gus, Lt. Walker, Harrigan, Andrews, Captain Talcott -- and Beth Gardner.  With them is an older, white-haired man, DR. ANDREW LAMOTT.  There are copies of \"Love Hurts\" around the table. \nLT. WALKER Dr. Gardner? \nHe nods. \nCATHERINE Come in. \nINT. THE HOUSE \nIt is beautifully done in a Santa Fe motif.  She goes to a bedroom of the living room. \nNick sits down on a couch facing the bedroom she's walked into. Gus sits across from him, his back to the bedroom. \nThere is a coffee table between them.  She leaves the bedroom door halfway open. \nAn old newspaper is on the coffee table.  Nick reaches for it. The headline says VICE COP CLEARED IN TOURIST SHOOTINGS.  A headline underneath says GRAND JURY SAYS SHOOTINGS ACCIDENTAL. There is a photograph of Nick. \nHe stares at the paper. \nCATHERINE How long will this take? \nNick puts the paper down on the coffee table.  He is lost in his thoughts.  Gus picks the paper up. \nNICK (looks up) I don't know. \nNick, facing the half open bedroom door, sees a mirror near the wall of the bedroom.  The mirror reflects her in the other corner of the bedroom.  She is taking her clothes off.  He stares.  She strips down.  He sees her back. She has a beautiful body.  Naked, she puts a dress on.  She doesn't put any underwear on. \nNICK Do you always keep old newspapers around? \nCATHERINE Only when they make interesting reading. \nAnd she is suddenly out of the bedroom.  She stands there, smiles.  They look at each other a long beat. \nCATHERINE (finally) I'm ready. \nThey get up, head out. \nGUS You have the right to an attorney. \nCATHERINE Why would I need an attorney? \nINT. THE CAR - DAY \nThey sit in the front; she is in the back.  The car goes over the winding, two-lane Mt. Tamalpais road. \nThe fog is heavy.  It's starting to rain.  We see the beach far below. \nCATHERINE Do you have a cigarette? \nNICK I don't smoke. \nCATHERINE Yes, you do. \nNICK I quit. \nShe smiles, looks at him.  A beat, and he turns away.  Another beat, and she lights a cigarette up. \nNICK I thought you were out of cigarettes. \nCATHERINE I found some in my purse; would you like one? \nHe turns back to her. \nNICK I told you -- I quit. \nCATHERINE It won't last. \nA beat, as she looks at him, and then he turns away. \nGUS You workin' on another book? \nCATHERINE Yes I am. \nGUS It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time. \nHe watches her in the rearview mirror. \nCATHERINE It teaches you to lie. \nGUS How's that? \nCATHERINE You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief. \nGUS I like that.  \"Suspension of Disbelief.\" \nHe smiles at her in the mirror. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER \nLT. WALKER You describe a white silk scarf in your book. \nCATHERINE I've always had a fondness for white silk scarves. (she smiles) I have a very vivid imagination. \nNICK But you said you liked men to use their hands. \nCATHERINE No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands. (she smiles) I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow. \nThey have their eyes on each other. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER \nCORRIGAN Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell? \nCATHERINE I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid. \nShe smiles. \nTALCOTT We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell. \nLT. WALKER Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook. \nNICK Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him. \nCATHERINE Yes it does, doesn't it? \nShe holds his eyes a second, then -- \nCATHERINE The answer is no.  I didn't kill him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER \nGUS Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell? \nCATHERINE Sometimes. \nHARRIGAN Did you ever do drugs with Mr. Boz? \nCATHERINE Sure. \nGUS What kind of drugs? \nCATHERINE Cocaine. \nShe looks directly at Nick. \nCATHERINE Have you ever fucked on cocaine? (she smiles) It's nice. \nHe watches her. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER \nNICK You like playing games, don't you? \nCATHERINE (smiles) I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun. \nThey are holding each other's eyes. \nNICK How about boxing?  That's a game. Was that fun for you? \nThey don't take their eyes off each other for a second. \nTALCOTT I think that's irrelevant to this inquiry. \nCATHERINE (to Nick) Yes it was.  Bobby died. \nNICK How did you feel when he died? \nCATHERINE I loved him.  I hurt. \nTheir eyes are still on each other. \nNICK How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach. \nNICK Sure. \nCATHERINE (smiles) Thanks. \nAnd he and Catherine walk away.  Gus and Walker watch them. \nINT. HIS CAR - NIGHT \nIt is an old, mint-condition silver Porsche.  It is pouring rain; the wind is blowing a San Francisco winter storm.  Nothing is said a long beat as he drives.  She yawns.  Stretches.  He looks at her. \nCATHERINE (smiles) I'm tired. \nNICK It's got to be tiring to beat that machine. \nShe looks at him and looks away.  A beat. \nCATHERINE If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all. \nNICK Why not? \nCATHERINE Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies. (a beat) For my writing. \nHe looks at her. \nCATHERINE (smiles) I love the rain, don't you? \nHe says nothing, doesn't look at her. \nCATHERINE You took a polygraph after you shot those two people, didn't you? \nHe looks at her now. \nNICK I passed. \nCATHERINE You see?  We're both innocent, Nick. \nHe pulls up in front of her house on Divisadero, stops.  He sees the white Ferrari in the driveway. \nNICK How do you know all this stuff about me? \nCATHERINE You know all about me. \nNICK I don't know anything that isn't police business. \nCATHERINE (after a beat) You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick? \nThey look at each other a beat. \nCATHERINE (smiles) Thanks for the ride. \nAnd she's out of the car.  He watches her as she hurries in the rain -- his eyes on her until the moment she opens the door and is inside. \nINT. THE TEN-FOUR - NIGHT \nIt is a police bar, San Francisco style.  Ferns  Joe Montana and Will Clark posters.  The jukebox has a lot of Tony Bennett. \nHe walks in.  He sees Lt. Walker at a back booth with Gus, goes to them, sits down. \nLT. WALKER What is all this \"Nick\" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride. \nNICK She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody. \nLT. WALKER And you volunteered. \nA BARTENDER stays behind the bar, but yells to him. \nTHE BARTENDER Perrier, Nick? \nNICK Double Black Jack rocks, Harry. \nGUS (with concern) What you doin', son? \nNICK It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop? (to Lt. Walker) She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her. \nTHE BARTENDER Here you go, Nick. \nHe gets up, gets his drink -- \nNICK Thanks, Harry. \nHe sits back down.  He takes a big slug.  They watch him. \nLT. WALKER You sure? \nA light goes on in an upstairs bedroom.  The curtain is drawn. He sees the outline of her body now. \nShe starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window, behind the curtain.  He watches her body as she does an almost languorous strip.  His eyes are intense... ravishing. \nINT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT \nHe is alone, nobody else in the big room. \nHe sits in front of a computer.  We see the screen.  He has punched in \nHAZEL DOBKINS, WF, 145 ALBION RD., MILL VALLEY. \nHe is waiting for a response.  We see it come on screen \nNOTHING CURRENT. \nA long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we see these words \nRELEASED, SAN QUENTIN, JULY 7, 1965. \nWe see him type in the words \nPRIOR ARREST RECORD. \nA long beat, and then it comes up \nHOMICIDE, JANUARY 10, 1956 - SAN FRANCISCO \nHe stares at the screen a long beat. \nGUS (behind him) Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine? \nNICK (after a beat; lost in his thoughts) What are you doing here, Pop? \nGUS (grins) I came in here to jack off the damn machine. (a beat) One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein.  Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what?  He was her counselor. \nNick looks at him a beat. \nNICK Was she ever suspect? \nGUS No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her. \nNick sits back a long beat, his eyes off somewhere. \nNICK (slowly) Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins? \nGUS (grins) Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it. \nNick just stares at him. \nEXT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY \nHe pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car. He stands there a beat, thinking.  He walks down to the beach entrance of the house.  He hears a Rolling Stones SONG playing inside.  He stands there.  The door suddenly opens.  Catherine stands there, smiles.  She wears very tight-fitting spandex leotards. \nCATHERINE Hi. \nHe looks at her a beat, then -- \nNICK Am I... disturbing you? \nCATHERINE No.  Come in. \nThey have their eyes on each other.  A beat, and she turns to go in. \nINT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE \nShe goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside.  He watches her body.  His movements are tentative, off-balance.  She turns the Stones DOWN. \nOn a table by the window, he sees a word processor.  Spread around it are newspaper clippings.  They are all about him. \nWe see the headline on one KILLER COP TO FACE POLICE REVIEW. She sees him glancing at the clips. \nCATHERINE I'm using you for my detective. In my book.  You don't mind, do you? \nShe smiles.  He looks at her, expressionless. \nCATHERINE Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one. \nNICK No, thanks. \nShe goes to the bar. \nCATHERINE (smiles) That's right.  You're off the Jack Daniels too, aren't you? \nRoxy stands there, staring at them.  Her hair is up.  She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a black T-shirt, and black jeans and cowboy boots. \nCATHERINE (brightly) Hiya, hon.  You two have met, haven't you? \nRoxy looks at Nick.  Catherine goes to her, kisses her briefly on the lips, stands there with her arm around her --both of them looking at Nick. \nHe walks by them, opens the door to go, his face a mask. \nCATHERINE You're going to make a terrific character, Nick. \nHe doesn't look at her; he's gone. \nINT. BETH GARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY \nHe comes in.  He looks like he's going to kill someone.  A RECEPTIONIST sits there. \nRECEPTIONIST She's on the phone -- she'll be right with you, detective --He sweeps by her into Beth's inner office.  She hangs up when she sees the look on his face. \nNICK Who has access to my file? \nBETH What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you? \nNICK Who's got access to my goddamn file? \nShe gets up -- he goes closer to her; she backs away from him. \nBETH Nobody. \nHe goes closer to her; she backs away. \nBETH It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall. \nNICK Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me. \nShe says nothing, looks scared. \nNICK (suddenly) It's Internal Affairs, isn't it? \nBETH No, Nick, please -- \nNICK (loud, hard) Who? \nBETH (blurts it) Nilsen. \nINT. THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION - DAY \nHe storms into the big room.  He sees MARTY NILSEN.  He is sitting behind his desk in his glass-enclosed office inside this big room.  About a dozen plainclothes policemen are in the big room.  He goes by them into Nilsen's office. \nINT. MARTIN NILSEN'S OFFICE \nHe closes the door.  Nilsen sees the look on his face, backs his chair away towards the wall. \nNILSEN What do you want, Curran? \nHe goes to him, picks him up by his lapels, slams him against the wall. \nNICK (out of control) You sold her the file, didn't you? \nNILSEN (scared) What are you talking about? \nNICK (out of control) What'd she pay you? \nHe slams him against the wall again.  The glass EXPLODES behind them -- a chair comes into the room.  Nick is frozen, holding Nilsen by the throat against the wall. \nONE OF THE I.A. GUYS Let him go, Curran.  Nice and easy. \nHe looks back, sees two Internal Affairs men with their guns drawn, pointed at him.  A beat, and he lets Nilsen go.  He turns calmly and starts to walk out. \nNILSEN You're on sick leave, Shooter.  As of right now.  Pending the outcome of a psychiatric evaluation. \nEXT. THE POLICE PARKING LOT - DUSK \nHe gets into his old Porsche.  He STARTS the car up.  Gus Moran comes up to the window.  They look at each other a \nGUS What's goin' down, son? \nNICK Nothin' (a beat) I'll be okay, pop. \nThey look at each other a long beat. \nGUS No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge. \nNICK (after a long beat) I got tired of being played with. \nNick stares at Nilsen's body.  They watch him. \nLT. WALKER Give me your gun, Nick. \nA beat, and then Nick gives him his gun.  Walker smells it, shakes his head, gives it to one of the Internal Affairs men. \nNICK (to Walker) You think I -- \nGUS I don't son, but I got the minority opinion. \nINT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nHe sits in the same room that Catherine sat in --surrounded by four or five Internal Affairs men, Lt. \nWalker, Gus, and Captain Talcott.  Lt. Walker and Gus sort of sit back -- I.A. is running the investigation.  The same police stenographer -- the same plain young woman -- is sitting in the room who was there with Catherine. \nNICK Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper. \nAN I.A. MAN Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone? \nNICK (after a beat) No. \nBeth Gardner comes into the room.  They look at her. \nAN I.A. MAN We'll speak to you afterwards, Dr. Gardner. \nNick gives her a look. \nBETH I'd like to sit-in if you don't mind. \nTHE I.A. MAN I'd really rather -- \nTALCOTT I don't see anything wrong with Dr. Gardner sitting-in if Detective Curran doesn't object. \nNick looks at her, shrugs. \nAN I.A. MAN Where were you tonight? \nNICK Home. Watching TV. \nAN I.A. MAN All night? \nNICK Yeah. \nAN I.A. MAN Were you drinking? \nHe looks at Beth. \nNICK Yeah, I was drinking. \nAN I.A. MAN When did you start drinking again? \nNICK (after a beat) A couple days ago. \nBETH I saw Detective Curran at his apartment around ten o'clock.  He was sober and lucid.  I asked him in my capacity as his departmental therapist about his altercation with Lt. Nilsen.  He expressed regret and displayed no hostility. \nAN I.A. MAN (to Beth) How long were you at his apartment? \nBETH About fifteen minutes.  I saw there was no reason for my concern and left. \nShe and Nick look at each other.  He looks away and lights a cigarette. \nAN I.A. MAN There's no smoking in this building. \nNICK (after a beat) What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking? \nIt is the exact line that Catherine used.  A long beat. \nLT. WALKER I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him? \nNICK No. \nThey look at him a beat. \nNICK Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that. \nAN I.A. MAN Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi. \nLT. WALKER Like writing a book about killing a guy gets you off the hook for killing him. \nAN I.A. MAN (to Walker) I don't understand.  What are you talking about?  What book? \nLT. WALKER (to Nick) Private joke. \nNICK You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it. (he smiles) She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it. \nLt. Walker looks at him a long beat. \nLT. WALKER She's screwing with your head, Nick.  Pretty soon you're gonna look in the mirror and think you're seeing her. \nEXT. HIS APARTMENT \nIt is in the Marina District; on a street like Cervantes. \nHe gets out of his old Porsche; he sees her black Ferrari there. She is sitting on the front stoop.  She wears an Indian jacket, jeans and a T-shirt.  He goes up to her. She looks at him a beat. \nCATHERINE I heard about what happened.  What good's a shooter without his gun? \nShe smiles. \nNICK (a beat) How exactly did you hear? \nCATHERINE (after a beat) I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends. \nNICK (after a beat) I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend. \nCATHERINE (smiles) I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me. \nNICK (after a beat) I like you. \nCATHERINE Do you? \nNICK (smiles) Yeah.  Would you like to come up and have a drink? \nShe looks at him a beat. \nCATHERINE I didn't think you'd ask me. \nHe looks at her a beat. \nNICK (smiles) I'm not that easy to figure. \nThey start walking inside.  She walks ahead of him.  He watches her.  She turns suddenly. \nCATHERINE You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring. \nNICK (after a beat) Don't get too cocky. \nCATHERINE Why not? \nNICK You can make a mistake. \nCATHERINE (smiles) Not me. \nAnd she turns, heads inside; he follows her. \nINT. HIS APARTMENT - DAY \nThey walk in.  She looks at the bareness of the place. \nCATHERINE You should put some warmth into it.  You don't want it to reflect on your personality. \nShe turns, smiles at him.  He looks at the bottle of Jack Daniel's; there's not much left. \nNICK Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be. \nCATHERINE Fine. \nNICK Ice? \nCATHERINE (smiles) Please. \nThere is a palpable tension between them. \nHe takes the ice out, opens a drawer, takes out an icepick. \nCATHERINE Let me do that.  You like to watch me doing it, don't you? \nShe smiles; a beat and he hands her the icepick.  She takes it, starts to us the icepick, her back to him.  He lights a cigarette. \nCATHERINE Can I have a cigarette, please?  I told you you'd start smoking again. \nHe watches her working on the ice. \nCATHERINE Light it for me, will you? \nHe does, steps to her.  She parts her lips -- he puts it on her lip, watches it.  Their eyes are on each other. \nNICK How's your new book? \nCATHERINE I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character. \nThey look at each other a long beat. \nCATHERINE Thanks for the drink. \nHe nods, say nothing as she goes to the door -- \nCATHERINE I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me. (a beat) I'm going down to Johnny's club. \nNICK (after a beat) I'll meet you there. \nShe looks at him a long beat; and she's gone. \nINT. THE STAIRWAY \nAs she is going down the stairs, Gus Moran is coming up. \nHe does a real double-take as he goes by her. \nCATHERINE (smiles) Hi, Gus. \nHe looks at him a long beat, and he goes upstairs, into Nick's apartment. \nINT. NICK'S APARTMENT \nNick stands at the window, watching her outside.  A long beat, and he looks at Gus. \nGUS (after a beat) Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass? \nNICK (after a beat) She want to play?  Fine.  I can play. \nGUS (after a beat) Everybody that she plays with dies. \nNICK (after a beat, quietly) I know what that's like. \nINT. JOHNNY BOZ'S CLUB - NIGHT \nIt is dark, cavernous there are a thousand people in here. The MUSIC is ear-splitting, pulsing.  Lights flash. \nThe floor is huge.  At one time, this club was a church. \nHe walks around the sides, a drink in his hand, looking for her.  He doesn't see her. \nThe he catches a glimpse of Roxy.  She is dancing with another woman.  He watches her.  She is wearing pants and a jacket, her hair off to the side.  She looks very masculine tonight. \nRoxy laughs at the other woman, leaves her on the floor, starts moving through the sea of dancers.  He follows her through the press of bodies.  She goes towards the men's room.  She walks in. \nINT. THE MEN'S ROOM \nIt is large, dark, shadowy It was once the sacristy. \nA crowd scene men and women. Roxy presses through them. \nA haze of crack smoke; we see people doing poppers. \nShe opens the door to a toilet stall, walks in.  Nick is behind her.  As the door opens, he sees Catherine. \nShe wears a black motorcycle jacket, a very short skirt, stiletto heels.  Her hair is up.  He make-up is severe,  In the darkness, in the shadows she looks about 19.  A hot 19. \nA hot flash-trash 19. \nShe is in there with two men -- one of them is a big, body- built black guy.  She has a vial of something near her face. \nShe sees Nick watching her.  She whispers something to the tall black guy.  He looks at Nick, smiles a condescending smile. The door to the stall closes \nINT. THE CLUB \nHe is walking along the side, watching the floor, a drink in his hand.  The song ends and it seques right into the Stones's \"Miss You.\" \nHe sees her.  Her black leather jacket is off. \nShe wears a very tight, flimsy top, the short skirt, the heels. She is dancing with Roxy and the black guy.  He watches her move... watches her body. \nShe turns, sees him, dances, watches him... gets between Roxy and the black guy... they sandwich her with their bodies... keeps moving, turning... eyes on him... playing to him with her body.  He watches. \nA long beat, and he goes up to them.  His movements are \nalmost trance-like.  They look at each other.  A long beat. \nCatherine stops dancing.  he reaches for her.  She moves away. A beat their eyes are on each other.  She moves a step towards her.  A beat, as they look at each other...  and they start to move together. \nAnd she turns and she is gone. \nINT. HER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHe lies on the bed in the dark, quiet room.  He is on his back, his eyes open.  He has his arm around her.  She is asleep. \nCATHERINE (murmurs) Nicky. \nHe looks at her. \nINT. HER BEDROOM - MORNING \nHe wakes up.  She is not there.  He looks around.  The white scarf is gone.  The coke on the side table is gone. \nIn its place, a scrawled note \"The Beach -- C.\" \nEXT. HER STINSON BEACH HOUSE - DAY \nA cold and foggy day.  He gets out of his old Porsche, walks down the driveway.  He sees her out on the beach by the water. A small bonfire is near her.  He walks towards her. \nRoxy watches him, expressionless, from an upstairs window of the house.  He doesn't see her. \nHe walks up to Catherine.  She has an Indian blanket over her and is wearing a black felt English derby hat, her hair loose underneath. \nNICK (expressionless) 'Morning. \nShe doesn't look at him -- he smiles slowly.  She doesn't smile and she doesn't seem to like his smile, either.  She walks along the beach.  He walks with her.  A long beat. \nNICK I think Roxy got jealous. \nShe looks at him.  He looks like he is trying to hide a smile. \nCATHERINE (after a beat) She's seen me fuck plenty of other guys. \nThat wipes the hidden smile off his face.  He looks at her, walks with her.  A long beat. \nNICK Maybe she saw something she didn't see before. \nCATHERINE She's seen everything before. \nShe looks at him; he's smiling now. \nNICK She's never seen us before. \nHe's serious.  She looks at him.  She smiles slowly. \nCATHERINE Did you think it was so special? \nNICK I told her it was the fuck of the century. \nHe can't hide his smile anymore.  She says nothing, keeps walking. \nNICK (after a beat) What did you think? \nCATHERINE I thought it was a pretty good beginning. \nThey look at each other.  They keep walking.  A long beat. \nNICK How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too? \nCATHERINE (after a beat) Do you want her to join us sometime? \nHe looks at her: she's serious. \nNICK I didn't mean for me -- I meant for you. \nShe looks at him. \nCATHERINE I'm not as judgmental about women as I am about men. \nThey keep walking.  A long beat. \nNICK How's your shoulder? \nCATHERINE Fine.  How's your back? \nNICK It hurts. \nShe stops, looks at him.

He drinks it. \nGUS (quietly) You wanna die, son?  What is it -- those goddamn tourists -- you still feel so bad about that you're wigglin' your way into an icepi -- (suddenly louder) We got too many goddamn tourists comin' here anyway -- plenty more goddamn tourists where they goddamn came from. \nSome people here really give him the looks now.

They found a safety deposit box with fifty- thousand dollars in it, taken out three months ago, used that one time. \nHe looks at the fat woman again -- leers at her obscenely. \nShe looks away. \nNICK (after a long beat) It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago. \nGUS Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle. \nNick looks at him and smiles a thin smile; he's not there, he's completely preoccupied. \nINT.

Nick looks after him a long beat, shakes his head. \nINT. A CAR - NIGHT \nSomeone is following him slowly as he walks down the street.

THE STREET \nThe Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche is gaining ground behind it, making turns. \nINT. THE PORSCHE \nThe Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a road going up a hillside.

Something's on with you. (a beat) You're sleeping with her, aren't you? \nA beat, he stops looks at her, then keeps walking. \nNICK What is this interest you've got in her? \nBETH My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates -- \nNICK I thought you hardly know her. \nBETH I know the type.  I'm a psychologist. \nHe stops, looks at her. \nNICK (after a beat) That means you manipulate people too, doesn't it, Beth?

THE CLOVERDALE POLICE DEPARTMENT \nThey are going to their cars, parked side by side.

As they get to her -- \nNICK Ms. Tramell? \nShe takes a long look a Nick, then looks away. \nCATHERINE TRAMELL is 30 years old.  She has long blonde hair and a refined, classically beautiful face.  She is not knockout gorgeous like Roxy; there is a smoky kind of sensuousness about her. \nNICK I'm De... \nCATHERINE (evenly) I know who you are. \nShe doesn't look at them.  She looks at the water. \nCATHERINE How did he die? \nGUS He was murdered. \nCATHERINE Really.  Maybe that's why you're from Homicide.  How? \nNick glances at Gus. \nNICK With an ice pick. \nShe closes her eyes a beat and then, still staring out, we see a thin smile.  They see it, too, and glance at each other. \nNICK How long were you dating him? \nCATHERINE I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him. \nThey glance at each other again. \nGUS What are you -- a pro? \nCatherine looks at him -- that thin smile again. \nCATHERINE No.  I'm an amateur. \nShe looks away. \nNICK How long were you having sex with him? \nCATHERINE About a year and a half. \nNICK Were you with him last night? \nCATHERINE Yes. \nNICK Did you leave the club with him? \nCATHERINE Yes. \nNICK Did you go home with him? \n", "test2_true": "NICK Was there anyone with you last night? \nCATHERINE (looks at Nick) No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night. \nThey look at her a beat. \nNICK Let me ask you something, Ms. Tramell?  Are you sorry he's dead? \nCatherine looks at him. \nCATHERINE Yes.  I liked fucking him. \nThey stare at her.  She looks out at the water. \nCATHERINE I don't really feel like talking anymore. \nGUS Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you -- \nCATHERINE Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown. \nShe doesn't even look at them. \nCATHERINE (quietly) Otherwise, get the fuck out of here.  Please. \nA long beat as they look at her. \nINT. A CORRIDOR - POLICE HEADQUARTERS \nThe door says Dr. Elizabeth Gardner, Counseling.  Nick opens the door, peeks in.  The receptionist is not there.  A clock says 3. \nINT. THE COUNSELING OFFICE \nHe walks in -- sees the inner door open, walks in. \nNICK I'm sorry, Beth.  I -- I got hung up in Stinson. \nDR. ELIZABETH GARDNER, the police psychologist, is a very good- looking, dark-haired woman.  She is 30. \nBETH (smiles) How are you, Nick? \nNICK I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this? \nBETH As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick. \nNICK It's bullshit.  You know it is. \nBETH (smiles) I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay? \nHe sits down. \nBETH So -- how are things? \nNICK (after a beat) Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine. \nShe watches him closely. \nBETH (after a beat) How is your -- personal life? \nNICK My sex life is fine. (a beat) My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again. \nThat embarrassed her; she looks away from him. \nNICK (after a beat) Sorry. \nShe shrugs.  A beat. \nBETH How about the booze? \nNICK It's been three months. \nBETH (after a long beat) How about the coke? \nNICK No. \nBETH No? \nNICK (hard) No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore. \nShe smiles. \nBETH How's not smoking? \n", "test2_id": 712, "test3_input": "NICK You want to get out of here? \nShe looks at him a beat. \nBETH (smiles) Yes. \nAt the booth, Gus and Lt. Walker watch the two of them leave. \nGUS Maybe it's for old-time's sake. \nLT. WALKER (watches them go out) Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs. \nGUS (after a beat, smiles) He ain't that way.  He's got heart. \nLT. WALKER (smiles) Yeah.  I know. \nINT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nHe is kissing her -- hard, rough.  He forces her against the wall. \nBETH Don't -- please, Nick -- \nWe hear her dress RIP.  He kisses her harder -- we hear her panties RIP.  He gets the dress off, pushes his hands under her bra -- \nBETH Please don't -- don't -- \nHe puts his mouth to her shoulder, bites it -- as they move down to the floor. \nINT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - LATER \nIt is dark.  The are still partially dressed.  They are on the floor.  He lies on his back, staring at the ceiling. \nShe lies next to him -- the torn dress wound around her. \nThere is a bite mark on her shoulder.  A long beat, silence -- then -- \nBETH What was she like? \nNICK Who? \nBETH Catherine Tramell. \nNICK (after a beat) She said what you said she'd say. \nShe sits up, looks away.  He looks at her, puts his finger on the bite mark idly, gently.  A beat, and he kisses her shoulder gently, then lies back down. \nBETH I met her at Berkeley. \nHe looks at her. \nBETH We were in some of the same classes. \nNICK (after a beat) Why didn't you tell me? \nShe looks at him. \nBETH I'm telling you. \nThey look at each other a long beat. \nBETH (with difficulty) You've never been... like that... before. \nHe says nothing, looks away from her. \nBETH Why? \nHe doesn't look at her a long beat, says nothing. \nNICK You're the shrink. \nShe keeps looking at him.  He won't look at her. \nBETH You weren't making love to me. \nA beat; he looks at her. \nNICK Who was I making love to? \nShe looks at him a long beat. \nBETH You weren't making love. \nThey look at each other, a long beat, then away.  He lies back down.  Beth doesn't look at him, keeps sitting up. \n", "test3_true": "BETH (after a beat) I thought you quit. \nHe says nothing. \nBETH Top drawer in the foyer. (a beat) Get it on your way out. \nHe looks at her; she won't look at him. \nINT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - MORNING \nHe walks in.  He looks hung-over.  He sees Gus with Harrigan and Andrews and Lt. Walker in Lt. Walker's glass-enclosed office at the end of this big room. \nThey look at him when they see him. \nLT. WALKER You look like dogshit. \nGUS (grins) He looks a little shrunk, that's all. \nANDREWS (after a beat) We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977. \nNICK (a thin smile) She was there, wasn't she? \nLT. WALKER University records say she was there. \nHe and Nick look at each other a long beat, then -- \nLT. WALKER (suddenly) Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus. \nNICK What about me? \nGUS You're already gettin' psychological input, son. \nLT. WALKER (to Nick) Go stick your head in a tub of ice water. (a beat; then seriously) See where she leads. \nEXT. THE BEACH HOUSE AT STINSON - DAY \nThe black Ferrari is in the driveway.  He sits in an unmarked police car on a hillside above the house, watching.  It is a bleak, leaden gray day. \nCatherine comes out of the house.  She is dressed casually. \nShe gets into the Ferrari. \nINT. HIS POLICE CAR \nHe stays behind her at a safe distance on the winding panoramic highway -- a two-lane mountain road which leads from Stinson Beach into Marin County. \nShe suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting in and out, passing cars very fast. \nHe has to start cutting around cars to keep up.  This woman really drives. \nHe cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting a Grey Lines Tour Bus head-on.  Close call: sheer drops on either side. \nHe looks frazzled. \nINT. HIS POLICE CAR \nHe is behind her at a distance on a hilly Mill Valley road -- little streets, terraced hillsides, sharp turns. \nHe goes slowly, looks around, thinks he's lost her.  And then he sees the black Ferrari parked in front of a house obscured by hedges. \nHe parks the car a distance behind the Ferrari, sits there a long beat.  He gets out, goes carefully up to the hedges, looks. A small, nondescript house.  He watches.  He can't see anything inside the house. \nA beat, he reaches over to the mailbox and opens it.  He takes an envelope out, looks at the name Hazel Dobkins. \nINT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nHe watches as she comes out of the house.  A frail old woman in her 70's is with her.  She hugs the old woman, gets into the Ferrari, STARTS it up. \nHe waits a beat and then STARTS after her.  He stays behind her at a distance -- she is going slowly.  And then she suddenly GUNS it, cuts her lights -- her wheels SCREECH. \nHe GUNS his car after her.  He makes a turn.  She is gone. \nThere is a fork in the road.  He turns one way, goes a few hundred feet. \nNothing.  Blackness.  He stops. \nNICK (quietly) Shit. \nINT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT \nHe pulls his car up to her house at Stinson Beach.  The black Ferrari is in the driveway. \n", "test3_id": 713}

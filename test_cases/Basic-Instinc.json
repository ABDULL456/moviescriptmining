She leaves the bedroom door halfway open. \nAn old newspaper is on the coffee table.  Nick reaches for it. The headline says VICE COP CLEARED IN TOURIST SHOOTINGS.  A headline underneath says GRAND JURY SAYS SHOOTINGS ACCIDENTAL. There is a photograph of Nick. \nHe stares at the paper. \nCATHERINE How long will this take? \nNick puts the paper down on the coffee table.  He is lost in his thoughts.

WALKER Why have you waived your right to an attorney, Ms. Tramell? \nCATHERINE (to Nick) Why did you think I wouldn't want one? \nNICK I told them you wouldn't want to hide. \nCATHERINE I have nothing to hide. \nThe two of them keep their eyes on each other. \nShe sits down.  They sit around her.  Nick sits directly across from her.  She lights up a cigarette.  They watch her. \nShe is poised, cool, in complete command of herself. \nCORRIGAN There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell. \nCATHERINE What are you going to do?

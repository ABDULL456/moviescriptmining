"E.T." 
Commentary by Richard Michaels 
TITLES: "E.T. - THE EXTRA-TERRESTIAL" 
[The letters are in soft-purple against a black background. Purple is traditionally the color of that which is sacred.] 
EXT: NIGHT SKY: NIGHT 
The black screen becomes a night sky. The camera angles lowers to show a forest against the night sky. 
EXT: LANDING SITE: NIGHT 
In an opening in the forest stands a spacecraft. The view of the craft is obscured by tree branches. The atmosphere is misty, with blue lights coming from the spacecraft. 
[The opening scene is misty and diffused. This forces the audience to pay close attention to the images on the screen. The characters are not clearly seen. This engages the audience, as they attempt to see what the aliens really look like.] 
One creature walks up the gang blank and into the ship. 
INSERT: ALIEN HAND 
A strange hand, with two long and slender fingers protruding, move aside a branch that obstructs the view. 
[This concentrates the audience's attention. The creature going into the ship is being observed by another creature. Who are they? What's going on? This is another technique that forces the audience to focus on the action.] 
INT: SPACECRAFT'S GREENHOUSE: NIGHT 
The inside of the ship appears to be a greenhouse. There are sounds of water dripping. Cone shaped objects (possibly alien plants) sit among earth plants. Vapors flow up from the plants. 
[These images all appear non-threatening. The aliens are inferred to be collecting vegetation, and are thereby inferred to be harmless.] 
[Like many of Spielberg's other films, the opening sequences contain almost no dialogue. The story is told without verbal exposition. He forces the audience to become engaged in the storytelling process by giving them just bits of information that they have to piece together into the story. He doesn't insult their intelligence.]

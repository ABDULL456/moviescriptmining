KID It's awake! 
INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - DAY 
BLAIR is first to reach the edge of the silo, horrified at the sight of the dangling MARCUS. BARNES keeps the RPG trained on him, they shout over each other. 
MARCUS Get me the hell down from here! 
BARNES Shut up!   I told you to shut up! 
BLAIR Leave him alone! (turning away from him) Marcus, I'm so sorry... 
MORRISON and the OTHERS join them, eyes fixed on Marcus. 
BARNES It keeps talkin' at me. God this thing gives me the creeps. 
MARCUS Why are you doing this?    What is this place? 
MORRISON We're trying to-- 
NANCY (over him) Don't say anything!     It's probably uplinked to Skynet. 
Morrison puts a hand on her arm. 
MORRISON Then it's already too late. (to Marcus) This used to be an ICBM silo, we're just trying to stay alive here. Your turn-- where'd you come from? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARCUS Corpus Christi. It's in Texas.     Or it was. 
BARNES (AMAZED) It sounds completely human... it really could pass. 
JANE Didn't John Connor say they'd start building things like this? 
MORRISON Not yet-- not for years. (to Marcus) So, you're programmed with false memories, a human history-- 
MARCUS What are you talking about? 
MORRISON You can skip the act, we know what you are. 
NANCY Why are you even speaking to it?! 
BARNES She's right, let's just waste the damn thing-- 
NANCY It'll kill us all if we give it a CHANCE-- 
During the above, other KIDS and ADULTS IN BG AD LIB-- "Kill it," "Goddamn robot," etc.-- increasing mob anger, until-- 
MARCUS I'm a man! 
His impassioned CRY silences the onlookers.       He speaks more quietly, desperately: 
MARCUS (cont'd) Even if I never been treated like one. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) MARCUS (cont'd) Year after year after year on death row, I just wanted it to end! I cut my own wrists. But they nursed me back to health, `cause that wouldn't be fair, they needed to kill me themselves. For Chrissake, you all want me dead so bad-- just do it. (a scream) Do it! 
His CRY ECHOES through the silo. The CHILDREN cower behind the adults. BLAIR is genuinely moved by his plight. 
BARNES hefts the RPG, looks toward MORRISON-- "should I?" Morrison seems torn, about to give the order-- 
LISA rushes in from the communications area, breathless, amazed by her own news: 
LISA Regional got through to CLA-- they want us to rig a video feed. (gesturing at Marcus) He wants to see him. 
MORRISON Who does? 
LISA John Connor. 
They all seem astonished-- this has gone right to the top. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   OUTPOST/COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY 
MARCUS sits impatiently in a wooden chair, facing a VIDEO CAMERA and a MICROPHONE. BARNES trains an RPG at his head while MORRISON finishes PADLOCKING HEAVY CHAINS to the BOLTS in Marcus' arms and legs-- these attach to a nearby STEEL POST. BLAIR stands nearby. LISA fumbles nervously with the TRANSMITTER, plugging in wires. 
MARCUS So this guy is what, like king of the world, or what's left of it? (CONTINUED)

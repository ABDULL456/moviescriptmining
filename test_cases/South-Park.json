{"train": "\"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut\", by Trey Parker & Matt Stone & Pam Brady \nSouth Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut \nBy Trey Parker Matt Stone Pam Brady \nEighth Draft \nJanuary 21, 1999 \nFADE IN: \nVery happy, Disneyesque MUSIC swirls in. \nPAN DOWN from a pretty blue sky, to a small quaint town nestled in the hills. A wooden sign tells us this is South Park. \nEXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY \nBirds fly into the air, TOWNSPEOPLE smile to each other as they walk by. \nIt is a scene reminiscent of, if not directly ripped off from, the opening number of 'Beauty and the Beast'. \nA little eight year old boy walks happily down the street. He is STAN MARSH, a noble looking boy with piercing blue eyes and a strong chin. As he walks, he sings a happy song. \nSTAN I'm going to the movies To see the brighter side of life! I'm going to the movie Everything's gonna be alright! Forget all my troubles Put my own life on hold Let a studio tell me how I should view the world Where everything works out I love it that way I'm going to the movies The movies today! \nStan merrily walks up to a crappy looking house. \nINT. BEDROOM - MORNING \nWe are in a young boy's bedroom, just as his alarm clock goes off. BRRRRRTTT!!! \nRADIO ANNOUNCER Good morning South Park! It's five-thirty a.m. on Sunday!! Time to feed the horses and water the cows!! \nFrom the back, we see the blond haired kid sit up from his bed. He stretches, and then walks over to his closet. \nWe still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his closet and pulls out an orange coat. \nThe kid puts his coat on, then turns to camera and pulls the hood shut, so that we never get a good look at his face. \nMOTHER (O.S.) KENNY! YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH!!! \nThis boy's name is KENNY, and under his orange coat, we have no idea what he looks like, except for his European nose and hazel eyes. \nKENNY Mph rmph rm! \nINT. KENNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN \nKenny walks through his small, dirty house and into the kitchen, where his MOTHER, FATHER and OLDER BROTHER are sitting at the humble table. \nKENNY'S MOTHER Sit down, you can share some of your brother's waffle. \nThe doorbell rings. Kenny walks over to the door. \nEXT. KENNY'S HOUSE - DAY \nKenny opens the door to find Stan. \nSTAN Kenny! The Terrance and Phillip movie is out! You wanna come?! \nStan shows Kenny a newspaper clipping. It's an ad for the new Terrance and Phillip movie 'Asses of fire'. Kenny's eyes light up. \nKENNY Mph rmph rm, rmph! \nKenny walks away with Stan. His mother comes out after him. \nKENNY'S MOTHER Kenny! Where're you going? \nKENNY Mph mprh mprh rm! \nKENNY'S MOTHER What do you mean you don't want to go to church? \nKENNY Mrmph, rmph rmph rm rmph. \nKenny and Stan walk down the street. \nKENNY'S MOTHER Well fine, go ahead and miss church!! And then when you die and go to hell you can ANSWER TO SATAN!! \nDramatic MUSIC STING. Kenny stops, thinks for a minute... And then walks off with Stan anyway. \nEXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY \nStan and Kenny now both happily march down the street to the happy beat. \nTOM, a plastic surgeon, peeps his head out the door of his Rhinoplasty office. \nTOM Say, where are you boys going? \nSTAN We're going to the movies! To see the brighter side of life! Where everyone is beautiful And have their hair combed just right! \nKENNY Mph rmph rm rmph rm! Mph rm rmph rm! Mprh rm rmph rm rm Rmph rm rmph rm rmph! \nTOM Have fun you rascals! \nEXT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY \nKenny and Stan knock at the door. \nA handsome eight year old Semite, KYLE, answers the door. \nKYLE Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny? \nSTAN Kyle, check it out. \nKenny holds up the newspaper clipping. \nKYLE OH MY GOD, DUDE!!! \nKyle slips on his coat and heads out the door. But just then, Kyle's little brother, IKE, a two year old adopted Canadian boy bounces up next to him. \nKYLE No, Ike! You can't come with me! \nKYLE We HAVE to see this movie, dude! \nCARTMAN Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway. \nKYLE Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip! \nCARTMAN Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes. \nIKE Poo baba! \nSTAN Wait! I've got an idea! \nEXT. MOVIE THEATRE - A LITTLE LATER \nThe old Homeless guy from the intro song walks up to the Ticket Guy with the boys. \nHOMELESS GUY Uh, hi. I want five tickets to Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire. \nTICKET GUY You realize this movie is rated R? It may not be appropriate for your little ones. \nHOMELESS GUY Oh. (Turning to boys) Hey, he says this movie isn't appropriate for you. \nSTAN (Whispering) Look, homeless guy, if you don't want to buy us tickets, and NOT get your ten bucks and NOT go buy yourself a bottle of Vodka and not forget about how miserable your life is and not stop the voices in your head then go right ahead. \nHOMELESS GUY Five tickets please. \nThe Ticket guy suspiciously hands them over. \nINT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY \nThe boys are all sitting in the front row. Cartman has a huge tub of popcorn, all kinds of candy, and a large drink. \nIKE Purpre mama! \nKYLE Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting! \nANGLE - MOVIE SCREEN \nA TITLE reads 'Terrance and Phillip - Asses of Fire' \nBOYS HOORAY!!! \nOn the screen, we come across PHILLIP, a very handsome Canadian star with a great body. \nPHILLIP Say Terrance, what did the Spanish Priest say to the Uranian gynecologist? \nPAN OVER to TERRANCE, who is also Canadian, and equally handsome in a more rugged way. \nTERRANCE I don't know, Phillip, what? \nPhillip rips a big fart. Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily. \nANGLE - BOYS \nLaughing their asses off. \nKYLE That was sweet! \nSTAN Where do they come up with this stuff?! \nCARTMAN How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking? \nKYLE Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike! \nCARTMAN Oh. \nIKE Poo bada! \nANGLE - SCREEN \nTERRANCE You're such a pigfucker, Phillip! \nPHILLIP What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?! \nTERRANCE Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs. \nPHILLIP Oh yeah! \nTerrance and Phillip laugh merrily. \nANGLE - BOYS \nKYLE Woa, dude! Did they say what I think they said? \nANGLE - SCREEN \nTerrance pulls out a white envelope. \nTERRANCE Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter! \nPHILLIP A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master? \nTRACK IN on the boys' wide eyed faces as the dialogue from the film enters their innocent ears. \nTERRANCE It's from your mother. \nPHILLIP My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say? \nTERRANCE It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.' \nTerrance and Phillip laugh merrily. \nPHILLIP Oh, you fucking ball whore! \nThe boys don't laugh, they just smile widely, they seem busy taking it all in. \nCARTMAN Wow... Ball whore... \nTERRANCE Listen, you donkey raping shit eater- \nKYLE (To himself) Donkey raping shit eater. \nJust then, another kid skates up, spraying more ice in Stan's face. His name is GREGORY, and he is a very handsome eight year old boy, with golden hair and an open-buttoned shirt. He speaks with a rich English accent. \nGREGORY Come, Wendy, let us try to jump the hilly brush. \nStan looks at Gregory. \nSTAN Who are you, kid? \nGREGORY My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time. \nWENDY Want to skate with us? \nGREGORY We've been skating all morning. And laughing and talking of memories past. \nGregory skates away. Stan looks stunned. Finally, he tries to get Wendy's attention. \nSTAN We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie! \nWENDY That's nice, Stan. \nWendy skates after Gregory. Stan looks completely rejected. \nKYLE Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy? \nSTAN She's not my girlfriend, dude! \nMeanwhile, the schoolkids are all still gathered around Cartman. \nCARTMAN Yes, I saw the Terrance and Phillip movie. Who wants to touch me?  I said, \"Who wants to touch me?!\" \nA small boy steps forward and tentatively touches Cartman's arm. \nSMALL BOY Oooooh... \nEXT. SOUTH PARK - TOWN - MORNING \nEstablishing shot of the little town of South Park which consists of four buildings. The sun rises in the background. \nIt's a brand new day. \nEXT.

SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY \nThe kids of South Park are all in their seats, singing. \nKIDS Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're a shitsucking, cocksucking Unclefucka!! \nThe door opens, and suddenly the kids quiet down. \nCLOSE-UP on a hand puppet with a large red hat. It seems to be speaking. \nMR. HAT Okay, children, let's take our seats. \nAs the voice continues, we PULL BACK to reveal that the puppet is on the right hand of MR. GARRISON, a forty-six year old teacher who is in denial about his homosexuality. \nMR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT) We have a lot to learn and precious little time. \nGarrison looks over the class and notices that every single one of them is wearing a Terrance and Phillip T-shirt, except, of course, for Wendy. \nMR. GARRISON Why is everyone wearing T-shirts of Sigfried and Roy? \nKYLE It's not Sigried and Roy, Mr. Garrison, it's Terrance and Phillip. \nKIDS TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!! \nStan looks over at Wendy. She just rolls her eyes. Stan sulks. \nMR. GARRISON Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment. \nMR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT) That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe. \nCARTMAN I hate the environment. \nKYLE Dude, how can you hate the environment? \nCARTMAN 'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it. \nThe kids all GASP! \nMR. GARRISON Eric! Did you just say the \"F\" word? \nCARTMAN Fragile? \nKYLE No, he's talking about fuck, dude.

Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code. \nA look of shock comes over the principal's face. \nPRINCIPAL VICTORIA Article 42!  You don't mean-?! \nKYLE'S MOTHER Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you. \nPRINCIPAL VICTORIA But I- \nKYLE'S MOTHER You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school! \nKyle's mother sits herself down at Principal Victoria's desk. \nKYLE'S MOTHER Get out of that chair! The PTA is in charge now! \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nThe other school kids are in line for lunch. \nJust then, the Kyle's mother's voice comes blaring through the P.A. \nKYLE'S MOTHER Attention students. We are now enforcing a new dress code at South Park Elementary. Terrance and Phillip shirts are NO LONGER ALLOWED IN SCHOOL. Anyone wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is to be SENT HOME IMMEDIATELY. \nThe kids look down. They're all wearing Terrance and Phillip shirts. \nKIDS HOOORAY!!! \nThe kids all cheer and run out the door. Leaving the cafeteria absolutely empty... Except for Wendy. \nWENDY Hello? \nWendy's hello echoes throughout the entire building. \nINT.

The TITLE below her reads 'Outraged Mother'. \nNEWS ANCHOR Ms. Brovlofski, how are these kids seeing this film? Is bad parenting to blame? Or is it Canada? \nKYLE'S MOTHER Canada! \nNEWS ANCHOR Alright.

OPERATING ROOM \nIt's mid-operation. \nDOCTOR GAUCHE Siphon the fluid off his brain!! Vacuum! \nAnother nurse hands him a sucker tube.  He immediately shoves into Kenny's skull.  It starts to slurp and burble. \nDOCTOR GAUCHE Try to untangle his trachea and esophagus! \nNURSE Right! \nWhile Doctor Gauche wrestles with Kenny's lungs and torso, the nurse reaches into Kenny's mouth and pulls both his windpipe and esophagus out of his mouth, turning them inside out in the process. \nOff to the side, Stan, Cartman and Kyle look on as the doctor and nurses tangle themselves in knots with Kenny's innards. \nDOCTOR GAUCHE No!

Let's get it out of there!!! \nDoctor Gauche lifts Kenny's heart out of his body. \nDOCTOR GAUCHE We need to zap this, quick! \nAnd runs it to the microwave.  He opens the door. \nDOCTOR GAUCHE Who's making a potato? \nDOCTOR 2 My bad, sir.  I missed lunch. \nDOCTOR GAUCHE Damn it! I am NOT going to lose this kid!!!!!! \nINT. RECOVERY ROOM - LATER \nFade up from black.  We're close on Kenny's face.  His little eyes start to open. \nDoctor Gauche leans over him Kenny.  Stan and Kyle are there. \nDOCTOR GAUCHE Kenny.

Nobody in the audience laughs. \nANGLE - BOYS \nThey laugh merrily. \nRESUME - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW \nTERRANCE Good one, Phillip!  Cheers. \nPHILLIP Cheers, Terrance! \nTerrance extricates himself from the band. Conan is growing nervous. He looks out into the audience... \nKyle's mother is sitting there, looking angry. Conan makes eye contact with her, and then nods his head. Kyle's mother nods back. \nCONAN O'BRIAN (Nervous) So, guys, I need to ask you a serious question... \nPHILLIP I just farted Terrance back into the stone age! \nThey both laugh hard. \nBrooke Shields waits a beat, then belts out a fake laugh. \nBROOKE SHIELDS I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon! \nTERRANCE Nobody cares, Brooke Shields! \nCONAN O'BRIAN Terrance and Phillip... Whose idea was it, to have a person lighting a fart on fire in your movie?

There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language. \nSTAN'S MOTHER There are? \nKyle's mother thinks for a second. \nKYLE'S MOTHER Well no, I guess not...

No nothing... \nKenny continues on, flames shoot up randomly from the ground scaring the shit out of him. \nKENNY MPHR!! MMLY MMT! \nSuddenly, Kenny hears a CLAWING NOISE. It gets louder and louder. Kenny starts to run faster and faster. Now the clawing is RIGHT BEHIND HIM! Kenny spins around.

REHAB CENTER - DAY \nEstablishing shot of the small Betty Fordesque building. \nINT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER \nThe kids are sitting in chairs in a circle.  There are anti- drug signs on the walls: \"Crack is Whack\"; \"Get High on Pottery\"; and, \"I Go From Zero to Bitch in .9 Seconds.\"  MR. MACKEY, the wiry school counselor, leads the group.  There's a pottery wheel and lots of craft tables behind them. \nMR. MACKEY Mkay, it's come to my attention, that you boys have a potty-mouth problem, mkay. Now the sooner you recognize your problem, mkay, the sooner we can get you back to your third grade homeroom where you belong. \nKYLE But they're just words, Mr. Mackey. Our parents are over-reacting. \nBEBE Yeah, Wendy's here, and she doesn't even like Terrance and Phillip! \nWendy looks bored. Stan tries to smile at her, but she doesn't even acknowledge him. \nMeanwhile, Cartman is violently shaking in his seat. \nCARTMAN Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal... \nMR. MACKEY Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you. \nHe points at Gregory. The little British bastard from the lake. \nGREGORY My name is Gregory... And I have a potty mouth. \nWendy looks at Gregory. Stan notices this. \nCARTMAN You've got a stupid accent too. \nMR. MACKEY Eric, that is not appropriate. \nCARTMAN What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear. \nMR. MACKEY Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think. \nGREGORY How are you gonna do that? \nMr. Mackey crosses to a piano. He plays chords while speaking the following lines. \nMR. MACKEY There are times when you get suckered in, by drugs and alcohol and sex with wom-en. But it's when you do these things too much (Singing) That you've got to clear your head and get back in touch... \nMr. Mackey plays the piano and sings: \nMR. MACKEY You can do it, it's all up to you, mkay? With a method, there's nothing you can't do, mkay? You don't have to spend your life addicted to crack Homeless on the streets giving hand- jobs for cash as long as you follow this simple plan I'm fully convinced that it's, easy, mkay... \nThe kids are extremely disinterested. Mackey walks over to a chalkboard. \nThe children all listen, wide-eyed. \nINT. SUPREME COURT - DAY \nTERRANCE The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it. \nPHILLIP Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up. \nKYLE'S MOTHER THAT IS ENOUGH!! \nTERRANCE WAKE UP AMERICA! YOUR government censors YOU from the world. \nKYLE'S MOTHER NO THEY DON'T! \nPHILLIP YES THEY DO! AND I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU! IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR, THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT- \nBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP. \nSuddenly, the screen goes blank. A sign that says 'PLEASE STAND BY' comes on. \nINT.

Now, release Terrance and Phillip, or else we will EXECUTE your beloved Smothers Brothers!! \nTOMMY SMOTHERS Please listen to them!! \nDICK SMOTHERS They're not fucking around!! \nCANADIAN PRIME MINISTER We're not fucking around. This is not aboot deals. This aboot dignity. This is aboot freedom... This is aboot respect. RETURN Terrance and Phillip NOW!!! \nAnother Canadian leans in and whispers in the Prime Minister's ear. \nCANADIAN PRIME MINISTER Oh yeah...

Now I want you to watch this movie, with all the immature profanity taken out, and notice how much better a movie it becomes... \nMackey puts the tape in and hits play. \nThe TITLES come up 'Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire' Except that 'Asses' has been blurred out, and replaced with 'bunz'. \nKIDS HOORAY!!! \nThe movie begins. Phillip walks in. But it isn't Phillip's voice, somebody has dubbed him over. \nDUBBED PHILLIP Hey Terrance. I feel like I'm going to pass gas near your head. \nDUBBED TERRANCE I would rather you didn't, Phillip. \nDUBBED PHILLIP Oh? Is that so? \nPhillip farts on Terrance. \nTERRANCE Oh, you are such a maroon! \nPHILLIP You would know, dummy. \nThe boys look confused. \nTERRANCE You are pigeon-like in your intelligence. \nThe pseudo-Terrance and Phillip laugh. Terrance throws a match on Phillip and Phillip burns to death. \nA TITLE comes up - THE END. \nAnd the credits roll. \nCARTMAN WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?! \nKYLE Dude, they cut out 92 minutes! \nThe lights in the theater come up. \nMR. MACKEY So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence.

He'll never get 'em, see? \nSATAN Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me. \nSADDAM HUSSEIN Hey, come here, guy. \nSaddam pulls Satan around and plants a big wet kiss on him. \nCARTMAN Very funny dickhead- \nBZZAAT!

GARRISON Okay, now let's try to get an answer from somebody who's not a complete retard. Anyone? Come on don't be shy... \nJust then, the door bursts open and in walks a couple of Nazi looking American soldiers. \nThey walk over to the children and start pulling off their 'Free Terrance and Phillip' pins. \nSTAN Hey, what are you doing? \nSOLDIER You can't wear these in school. It's against school policy, thank you. \nAnother solider rips off Kyle's pin and replaces it with a yellow star. \nKYLE What's that for? \nSOLDIER 2 You get a star for doing well in school. \nJust as quickly, the soldiers make their way out the door. \nWENDY NAZIS!! \nSTAN What's the matter, Wendy? \nWENDY Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand. \nSTAN (To Kyle) God damn it, why does she keep saying that? \nINT. CAFETERIA - DAY \nThe boys are in line.

(To the soldier) Acht lieben kraft auct shpiler! (BZZZT) OW!!! \nThe soldier glares at him. The boys walk into the kitchen, where they are greeted by their big, happy, black school CHEF! \nCHEF Hello there, children!! \nSTAN Hey, Chef. \nCHEF How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles? \nKYLE We can't, we're on a hunger strike. \nCHEF A hunger strike?

I'll try to reroute the encryptions... \nKyle furiously hits a bunch more keys. \nSTAN Dude, do you know what you're doing? \nKYLE No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works. \nJust then the screen pops up. Access Granted. \nKYLE Bingo. Okay, here we go... (Typing) Want to help Terrance and Phillip?

Don't make any noises or nothing, okay? \nIKE Uhh... \nKYLE Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed. \nThe door closes and it is dark. \nIke blinks. He looks out a small window, onto the street below. \nA few armed soldiers walk by. \nIke pulls out a little plastic harmonica and sadly starts to play. \nINT. PENTAGON - NIGHT \nTons of MILITARY PERSONNEL are running to and fro. Giant computer screens show Canada's latest attacks. \nSECRETARY OF DEFENSE Sir! The Canadians have destroyed Des Moines!! \nPRESIDENT How can you tell? \nEveryone laughs merrily. \nSECRETARY OF DEFENSE Good one, sir! \nSuddenly, a PENTAGON GUY runs up to the President, holding some papers. \nPENTAGON GUY Sir, we're tracking a signal crossing into Canadian computers! It looks like we may have a resistance movement starting... \nThe President grabs the papers and dashes over to Kyle's mother, who is standing there looking smug, with her arms behind her back and her chest out. She has a few military badges on her. \nPRESIDENT (Showing her the papers) Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!! \nKYLE'S MOTHER Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost! \nPRESIDENT Yes ma'am! \nThe President starts to run off. \nKYLE'S MOTHER And Bill? \nPRESIDENT Yes? \nKYLE'S MOTHER I'm needing lunch. \nPRESIDENT Right away, ma'am! \nThe president runs off. \nEXT.

He stands there with the cord in his hands. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN GET GATES IN HERE!!! \nBILL GATES walks in, escorted by two MILITARY GUARDS. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN YOU TOLD US WINDOWS 98 WOULD BE FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH BETTER ACCESS TO THE INTERNET!!! \nBILL GATES It is faster, over five million-- \nPlymkin pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head.

LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT \nIn the dead of night, the kids are all in a circle discussing the plan. \nGREGORY ...after you clear this zone here, rendezvous behind this ridge where Terrance and Phillip should be held. \nKYLE Gotcha. \nGREGORY You are indeed brave, but you will need someone who's done this sort of thing before.  MOLE! \nSuddenly, a bump in the ground starts to move forward, leaving a trail behind it. (like bugs bunny before he pops out) \nThe bump comes to a stop at the children's feet and out pops THE MOLE.  He is a very bitter little nine year old French kid with a THICK French accent. \nVOICE Oui? \nGREGORY Thank you for coming, Mole. \nTHE MOLE So... We must free more Canadian prizoners? \nKYLE Yeah, I guess. \nTHE MOLE America... She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children. \nStan and Kyle look at each other confused. \nGREGORY This is the Mole.  He will accompany you to the prison where Terrance and Phillip are.  He is an expert in covert operations and a lifelong fighter for freedom. \nTHE MOLE Freedom... It's like cow's urine poured down your troat. You wonder 'Do I want this?' I'm thersty... But it's urine. \nEveryone stares at The Mole. \nGREGORY Good luck Stan, I'll make sure Wendy is... kept safe? \nStan gets pissed. \nKYLE Give me Terrance and Phillip or give me death!!! \nOTHERS YEA!!! \nNow, Gregory breaks into song. His voice is absolutely gorgeous and deep. He puts his hand on Stan's shoulder. \nGREGORY God has smiled upon you this day The fate of a nation in your hands... \nStan and Kyle look at each other. They can't believe how good this guy's voice is. Wendy appears enthralled. \nGREGORY As brothers and sisters we unite And behind you we shall fight! Until only the most righteous belief stands! \nThe music builds. Gregory gets up on a soapbox. \nGREGORY Do you see the distant flames? they bellow in the night Fight in all our names For what we know is right And if you all get shot and cannot carry on Though you die, La Resistance lives on! \nKYLE What? Shot? \nKyle and the boys look a little worried, as other kids join in the song. \nKIDS You might get stabbed in the head by a dagger or a sword You might be burned to death or skinned alive or worse! \nGREGORY But when they torture you You will not feel a need to run For though you die, La Resistance Lives on! \nKIDS Do you hear the beating drum?

We're going to execute this threat to our democracy! \nAll the mothers join in as they decorate the chairs with American flags. Kenny's mother is counting money she has made from selling t-shirts. \nM.A.C. MOTHERS And after that our kids will be safe from all the Canadian scum! The time is now the time is here Tomorrow something will be done! \nThe song still CONTINUES as we \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

Get on with my life in that world... Start over as part of that world... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MILITARY BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS \nTents and makeshift buildings are lined up against the mountains.  Jeeps and Tanks buzz to and fro. \nThere's a huge stage which is set up with thousands of seats. There's a giant banner reading \"USO SHOW TONIGHT!!!!!\" \nLoads of soldiers file into their seats. \nANNOUNCER Alright you men! The USO show is about to start!! \nThe military men go wild. \nANNOUNCER Get ready for loads of entertainment and fabulous celebrities! To be followed immediately by the swift and nasty execution of Terrance and Elroy! \nThe crowd goes crazy again. \nEXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - BEHIND THE USO SHOW - DUSK \nRight out of Nazi Germany.  Barbed wire, guards, the whole bit. \nANGLE ON BOYS \nThey are on their backs, shimmying along the ground underneath the blanket of razor-wire that is set up around the camp. \nThe Mole uses the bolt-cutters to cut the wire as he goes, clearing a path for Stan, Kyle and Cartman. \nTHE MOLE Be careful not to touch this wire- \nA wire catches on Cartman's arm and SNAPS against his face. \nCARTMAN OW!  MOTHERFUCKER! \nBZZAAAAT!!! \nCARTMAN FUC- \nStan shoves his hand over Cartman's mouth, leaving Cartman to cuss bloody murder into Stan's glove. \nCARTMAN MPHMPH MPHMPHMPH!!! \nBZAAT! \nCARTMAN MMMPPPHHH!!! \nFinally they clear the fence and lie down in view of the camp. \nTHE MOLE It sounds like the USO show has started. We have precious little time... \nKyle looks at the horrible concentration camp. \nKYLE Oh my God... \nTHE MOLE God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all. \nKyle looks at The Mole, oddly. \nSTAN How are we ever gonna find them? \nThe Mole whips out some night vision goggles. \nANGLE ON INTERMENT CAMP THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES \nThe Mole inspects the camp.  He sees a guard on a guard tower.  Then he pans over to a bunch of Canadians standing in a line in rags. \nThe Mole quickly clicks the magnification to high so we see the saddened faces of the Canadians. \nKYLE Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip? \nTHE MOLE No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig. \nKYLE That's gonna take a long time! \nTHE MOLE Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King? \nThe boys think. \nEXT. USO SHOW - DAY \nHelicopters zoom over the makeshift stage like the USO show in Apocalypse Now. \nGroups of soldiers cheer as a helicopter approaches the landing platform and touches down.  The US army men cheer. \nThe mothers take the stage, and Kyle's mother speaks into the microphone. Behind her is a huge American flag. She is wearing an army helmet. This is right out of 'Patton'. \nKYLE'S MOTHER Ladies and gentlemen of the American war effort, we salute you! \nA big cheer goes through the crowd. Kyle's mother feels the power, and lifts her head high. She starts to pace back and forth on the stage as she speaks, becoming more and more Pattonlike. \nKYLE'S MOTHER Tomorrow you will be risking your lives so that our children will have a better future... God bless you men. And God bless this filth free nation. Many of you will die. Die like blood bathed pigs.  So tonight, we at MAC present a NIGHT OF A HUNDRED STARS!

She looks like a strung out coke addict; because she is. \nWINONA RYDER Hi guys!  I'm T.V.'s Winona Ryder! \nOne guy claps. \nWINONA RYDER I want you all to know I'm super psyched to be here today.  You guys rock.  What you're doing for our country so sooo cool.  It's so real.  I've been acting since I was twelve and I can't distinguish between make believe and real life. \nWinona falls down. But gets back up immediately. \nWINONA RYDER And then I confuse me real life with my big-screen one.  And sure, people get hurt, and I'm sorry about that but Christ, look at me.  It's not my fault that I can get any guy I want.  And that's reality to me.  But you guys... wow.  I mean, war, man. Fucking war.  It doesn't get any more real--  Now, this one goes out to you. \nShe cues the band which has been assembled from the same helicopter.  Jazz music starts up. \nIt's 'New York, New York'. The troops look confused. \nWINONA RYDER You know what I'm gonna do for you now, don't you? \n'New York, New York' continues to play. \nKYLE'S MOTHER Let's hear it again for the one and only Winona Ryder!!! \nThe same guy claps again. \nONE CLAPPING GUY We love you, Winona! \nEverybody else in the audience just stares at him. \nKYLE'S MOTHER Next up we have a special treat...

Big Gay Al saunters around the stage and starts to sing. \nBIG GAY AL (Singing) Bombs are flying People are dying Children are crying Politicians are lying too Cancer is killing Texaco is spilling The whole world's gone to hell But how are you? \nSuddenly, Big Gay Al is wearing a big feathery outfit and all his dancers dash to his side. \nBIG GAY AL I'm super!

Where the hell am I? Is anybody here? \nA few wolf HOWLS sound in the distance. Stan walks on. \nSTAN MARCO!!! \nNo answer. \nSTAN MARCO!!! \nNo answer. Stan stumbles a bit. \nSTAN Dude, weak... Can't go on... Dizzy... \nStan falls to the ground. His face plops in the rainy mud and his head smacks against a rock. \nStan is out cold. \nJust then, a strange sound emerges. It is like a pulsating WOBBLE. Stan slowly awakes, picks up his head and shines his flashlight around. \nSTAN What is that? \nThe sound gets louder. Stan shines his flashlight on something that is huge and throbbing. \nSTAN OH MY GOD!!! \nEXT. STAGE - NIGHT \nKyle's mother approaches Terrance and Phillip. \nKYLE'S MOM Gentlemen, do you have any last words? \nWendy pulls Stan up off the ground and slings his arm around her. \nEXT.

Total and complete mayhem. \nOne explosion knocks out the electricity, and Terrance and Phillip stop drying. \nThe electricity runs along a wire, across the stage, and right up Cartman's leg. Cartman starts frying horribly. \nKYLE CARTMAN! \nCARTMAN (Frying) WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!! \nPHILLIP What's going on Terrance? \nTERRANCE Canada is saving us!! \nFinally, Cartman is blown clear of the electricity. Kyle picks him up and starts to run along with Ike. \nINT. HELL - SATAN'S BEDROOM \nSatan opens the door to find Saddam sleeping happily in his cozy bed. He is only wearing little black g-string panties. \nSATAN (Whispering) Have you finished? \nNow we see that Kenny is standing at the foot of the bed. He holds a gasoline can, and has just finished pouring the last drops underneath the bed. \nKENNY Mph mph. \nSATAN Then move out of the way. \nKenny walks over next to Satan. Satan pulls out a book of matches. \nSATAN I must be strong... I must be strong... \nSatan tries to light the match. It won't light. \nSATAN Damn it... \nFinally, the match lights. Satan holds it up- \nSATAN Goodbye, Saddam... \n-and throws it onto the bed. \nSATAN Come on! \nSaddam burns to a crisp and Satan and Kenny run out. \nEXT. USO SHOW - DAY \nPeople run screaming in all directions as a full scale attack has broken out. Gunfire, explosions and dead bodies fly all around. \nJIMBO Ned!  Behind you! \nNed whips around and mows down a line of Canadians. But one Canadian makes it through, and sticks his bayonet through Ned's neck. \nBlood gushes from Ned's neck as he collapses. \nJIMBO NED!!! NOOOOOOO!!!!! \nFWWOOM!! BLAMMM!!! The boys runs as fast as they can amidst the explosions. \nCARTMAN HOLY SHIT! (Zap) AGHAGHGAH!! \nNow when the V-chip shocks Cartman, we can actually see the blue current swirl around his body. \nCARTMAN HEY! THIS V-CHIP IS GETTING ALL SCREWY!! \nGeneral Plymkin has followed his men into the trench, where explosions and gunfire fly all around. He pulls out a walkie talkie as his men die all around him. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN ALRIGHT MEN!!!  FALL INTO FORMATION! \"HUMAN SHIELD\" UP FRONT THEN \"OPERATION GET BEHIND THE DARKIES\"!!! \nThey all fall in.  A phalanx of black men, Chef included in them, walk out in front of a bunch of white guys. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN REMEMBER, HUMAN SHIELD!  PROTECT OUR TANKS AND PLANES, TOO! \nJust then, over a ridge in front of them, a line of Canadian tanks appears. The tanks are lined up 3 deep.  Behind them is a line of missile launchers.  General Plymkin's jaw drops. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN Holy Mother of Johosephat... \nThe black guys all look at each other nervously. \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD \nThe boys run through the chaos.  Body parts and scrapnel fly here and there. \nPHILLIP Terrance! NO! \nKYLE'S MOTHER DIE!!!!!! \nSLOW MOTION SHOT - \nBlood from Terrance's abdomen slowly spills from his stomach. \nEverything gets SILENT as we follow the blood down, down, down... \nUntil it hits the ground with a huge, echoing BWOOOMMMM!!! \nCLOSE UP on Kyle's mother's eyes. \nCLOSE UP on the spot of blood on the ground... \nBACK TO REAL TIME \nSuddenly, the ground starts to open up! FWOOM!! Great flames and ash take over the sky. \nSatan and his minions explode from below. Everyone stops fighting for a moment, to watch this amazing spectacle. \nSATAN RAAGHGH!!!! MY TIME HAS COME!!! \nDemons and flames emerge from the ground. All the soldiers on both sides can't believe what they're seeing. \nNow out of the giant abyss comes Kenny. He dusts himself off and looks around. \nEXT. TRENCH - NIGHT \nAs more bombs and gunshots go off. Kyle, Cartman and Ike huddle close to each other in a trench. \nCARTMAN Kyle... All those times I said you were a big dumb Jew... I didn't mean it. You're not a Jew. \nKyle thinks. \nKYLE Yes I am! \nIKE Baba mama! \nAnother explosion rocks the trench. Dirt flies all over the boys' heads. \nCARTMAN AGH! (Noticing Mr. Hat in his hand) What the hell am I still holding this for?! \nCartman tosses Mr. Hat out of the trench. We hear GUNSHOTS and then VERY FAINTLY we hear Garrison's voice. \nMR. GARRISON Mr. Hat! Noooooo! \nSuddenly, Stan jumps down into the trench. \nKYLE Stan! \nSTAN Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now! \nKYLE Sweet. \nCARTMAN (Sarcastic) Oh, that's swell, Stan. I guess all's well that ends well, huh? We can go home now. There's just one little thing left to tie up... WORLD WAR THREE!!! \nMore explosions go off. Dead bodies fly all around the boys. \nSuddenly, Kenny appears before the boys. \nCARTMAN/KYLE AGAGAH!!! \nCARTMAN It's him! I told you!! Kenny's come to take us to the netherworld! \nKENNY Mph rmph rmph rmph?! \nKYLE Wait! He's not haunting us, he's trying to tell us something! \nKENNY Mph rmph rm rmph rm! \nCARTMAN Okay!  We can get you some proofs of purchases for Snacky Smores Kenny!  Just mellow the heck out! \nEXT. SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH PARK - NIGHT \nMore battle. People are dying left and right. \nThe Doctor from the Hospital scene runs in with an M-16. A Canadian steps in front of him, the doctor shoots, and blows the Canadian's head clean off. \nDOCTOR GAUCHE Hey, pal, don't lose your head. \nSuddenly, the ticket guy's chest rips open. He falls dead, and standing behind him is a Canadian with a double barreled shotgun. \nCANADIAN SOLDIER I'm glad you got that off your chest. \nTom the Rhinoplasty surgeon leaps in and stabs the Canadian through the head with his bayonet. \nTOM I guess he got the point. \nA Canadian rushes in and machine guns Tom full of holes. \nCANADIAN SOLDIER 2 Plastics are a cheap and efficient insulator for electrical applications. \nJust as the fighting escalates, Satan and his minions rush in. \nSATAN Yes! Good! Fight and kill one another! \nThe soldiers all look scared and puzzled. \nSATAN You're all part of Satan's army now! \nKYLE'S MOTHER What the hell is going on?! \nSatan gets in Kyle's mother's face. \nSATAN I am the dark master! \nKYLE'S MOTHER Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz! \nSATAN SILENCE!  I AM SATAN! \n", "test1_input": "The president forces a smile and actually applauds with the rest of the crowd. \nBack in the gymnasium, Kyle looks thoroughly embarrassed. \nCHEF Damn, your mom's a bitch, Kyle. \nCARTMAN Amen to that. \nINT. HELL - DAY \nKenny is sadly walking around hell. He walks up to another one of hell's prisoners. \nKENNY Mph rmph rm rmph rm? \nGEORGE BURNS Snacky Smores? Why the hell would I have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores? Beat it, kid. \nKenny moves along. He hears some voices coming from a door. Kenny opens the door and peeps inside- \nINT. SATAN'S BEDROOM - KENNY'S POV \nSaddam and Satan are lying in bed. \nSADDAM HUSSEIN You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself. \nSATAN I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself- \nJust then, Satan hears a reporter on CNN. \nTV In war news, countries from Europe and Asia are joining sides in the Canadian- American War- \nSADDAM HUSSEIN -Listen butterbuns, let's make love and forget about the whole thing- \nSATAN SHHH!!!! \nTV ...The death count is already on its way to 10 million with no signs of slowing down.  What started as a spat between the United States and Canada is quickly turning into World War III- \nKenny's eyes bulge, he wants to see more, but Satan clicks off the television and sits up in bed. \nSATAN It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us! \nSADDAM HUSSEIN Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank! \nSATAN No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign. \nSatan walks over to large pedestal which holds an ancient tome.  Satan turns the pages as he talks. \nSATAN Behold, the signs of my reign on earth are all falling into place!  The fall of an empire- \nHe points to an ancient-looking picture of the death of Ceasar. \nSATAN -The coming of a comet- \nHe points to a picture of a comet passing by Earth. \nSATAN Jerry Springer's movie doing more than ten million box office- \nA picture of Jerry Springer holding a bunch of money. \nSATAN ....And now.... \nSatan points to an ancient drawing on the wall. It looks like Terrance and Phillip being stabbed in the head. \nSATAN The seventh sign!  When the blood of these Canadians touches American soil... It will be my time to rise!!!!! \nDRAMATIC music. \nSADDAM HUSSEIN Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!! \nSATAN Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here! \nSADDAM HUSSEIN Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing. \nSATAN Is sex the only thing that matters to you? \nSaddam thinks for a second. \nSADDAM HUSSEIN I love you. \nSatan sits with his arms crossed and a frown. \nSADDAM HUSSEIN You know I do. \nSATAN I know. \nSADDAM HUSSEIN So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh? \nSatan reaches over and turns off the light.  Everything goes pitch black. The light goes off of Kenny's face as well. \nA beat. \nThen, a small moan from Satan. \nSADDAM HUSSEIN Yeah, you like that, don't you bitch? \nEXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY \nStan and Kyle are walking down South Park Avenue. Stan is reading out of a huge book. \nKYLE Does it say what the clitoris is? \nSTAN All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva? \nKYLE Isn't that in Arizona or something? \nStan and Kyle walk into the middle of town, where a HUGE bonfire of Terrance and Phillip videos, posters, and Canadian items like syrup and hockey sticks are burning away. \nThe soldiers throw Stan's book on top of the pile, and it starts to burn. \nStan and Kyle walk up to where Cartman is standing. \nSTAN What is this? \n", "test1_true": "STAN That book wasn't Canadian! \nClyde, one of the kids from school, throws his Terrance and Phillip dolls into the burning mass. \nKyle stops him on his way back. \nKYLE Dude, don't you like Terrance and Phillip anymore? \nCLYDE Of course not! We're at war! My daddy says I HATE Canadians now! \nMore kids line up to burn their Terrance and Phillip stuff. \nSeveral random mothers from M.A.C. are standing in front of the bonfire with anti-Canadian signs and T-shirts. The boys' parents aren't around, but another MAC mother is leading the charge. \nMAC MOTHER THAT'S IT! BURN EVERYTHING CANADIAN!!! MAKE OUR COUNTRY DECENT AGAIN FOR OUR CHILDREN!!! \nA townsperson throws Alanis Morisette albums into the fire. \nAnother townsperson runs up and throws in a bag of Cheesy Poofs. \nCARTMAN NNOOOO!!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! OH, WHY GOD, WHY?! \nCartman falls to his knees and cries as the Cheesy Poofs burn away. \nCARTMAN This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch- (BBBZAATT!!) AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie. \nKYLE And she's getting worse... \nSTAN Dude... Isn't that your brother? \nKyle looks to where a group of big, mean FIFTH GRADERS have encircled Ike. \nFIFTH GRADER Why don't you go back to your own country, CANADIAN! \nFIFTH GRADER 2 Yeah, go eat some potatoes and ride donkeys! \nIKE Eee todo ba! \nKyle's eyes grow wide. He dashes over. \nKYLE Hey! Leave him alone! \nFIFTH GRADER It's just a smelly Canadian. They're like rats. \nKYLE He's my brother! \nFIFTH GRADER You don't look Canadian. \nKYLE He's adopted! \nKyle picks his brother up and tries to protect him. \nFIFTH GRADER Well you better get his beady eyed Canadian ass out of America before my daddy finds him!! \nThe boys watch in horror as the fifth graders run over and throw more Canadian items into the fire. \nKYLE It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too! \nSTAN What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people- \nCARTMAN -no Cheesy Poofs. \nSTAN -No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening? \nDRAMATIC MUSIC begins. \nKYLE I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it! (Singing) Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done! \nSTAN I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight! (Singing) Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past! \nCARTMAN And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done! \nSTAN But what are we going to do against this entire army? \nKYLE We've gotta get the word out. We'll get on my dad's computer and use the internet! Come on you guys! \nThe boys proudly head down the street. \nBOYS Something must be done! Something's gotta give! This world has become a bitch in which we have no desire to live! \n(*note- cartman gets shocked again on 'bitch') \nBOYS We've pushed it to the edge And now the time has come! Something's gotta change! Something must be done! Something must be done!!! \nINT. KYLE'S HOUSE - KYLE'S DAD'S OFFICE \nKyle is at the keyboard of his dad's computer. Stan and Cartman are waiting in the background. \nKYLE Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards... \nSTAN Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'. \nKYLE Okay... \nKyle types in the word and hits return. \nKYLE (Reading the screen) \"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris\"! \nSTAN Wow! \nKYLE I'll just try the first one. \nKyle clicks the mouse. They wait for the screen to load. Finally, it does. \nKYLE Dude! It's a lady giving a blow job to a horse! \nStan and Cartman rush over. \nSTAN Is it Cartman's mom? \nCARTMAN Very funny! \n", "test1_id": 1485, "test2_input": "SATAN (Gently) Sometimes I think When I look up real high That there's a whole world up there And just maybe it could be mine But then, I sink because it's here I'm supposed to stay but I don't even know how or why its supposed to be that way- \nSatan walks to his veranda. \nSATAN Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom Everyone dreams I can dream too Up there, Up where The skies are ocean blue I could be safe and live without a care... Up there \nSatan walks over to a bright blue globe and spins it slowly. \nSATAN They say I don't belong That my place is down below Because of my beliefs I'm supposed to stay where evil is sewn But what is evil anyway? Is there reason to the rhyme? Without evil there could be no good So it must be good to be evil sometimes Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom.

SMALL ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT \nA dim light is all that is visible from inside the small building. \nINT. LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT \nStan and Kyle are painting a sign on the wall 'La Resistance'. \nCartman comes running in, he looks scared. \nKYLE You're late, Cartman! \nCARTMAN I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me. \nKYLE Your behind? \nCARTMAN I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass- (BBZZAATT) OW!!! \nKYLE Did you bring the pie and punch? \nCARTMAN No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy? (Looking over each shoulder) I don't think Kenny is dead. \nSTAN What? \nCARTMAN I saw him last night! \nKYLE I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day. \nCARTMAN YOU DO?! \nKYLE Sure, dude.  On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby... \nKyle and Stan laugh again. \nCARTMAN Hey!  I'm telling you this WAS Kenny! I think he's haunting me. \nKNOCK KNOCK KNOCK! \nThe boys all look scared. \nKYLE Somebody's here... \nThe boys walk over to the door, and open the sliding panel in front of their eyes. \nKYLE Who is it? \nVOICE Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance. \nKYLE What's the password? \nVOICE Uhh... I don't know. \nKYLE Guess. \nVOICE Uhh... Bacon. \nKYLE Okay. \nKyle opens the door. The golden haired young boy from rehab stands there looking handsome and angelic. \nGREGORY Viva la Resistance. \nSTAN Oh no, it's that kid. \nGREGORY This is the place-- \nAnother kid walks up next to Gregory, it's Wendy. Stan's eyes grow wide. \nSTAN Wendy? \nWENDY Stan?! YOU started La Resistance? \nGREGORY Well, apparently you have a bigger heart than we thought. Let us get this meeting underway, there are others coming. \nGregory takes Wendy's hand and pushes his way in. Stan fumes. \nINT. LA RESISTANCE - LATER \nNow the room is filled with a bunch of scared looking RESISTANCE FOLLOWERS. All of whom are under the age of twelve. \nThe room is lit only by candlelight. And the large 'VIVA LA RESISTANCE' banner hands on the wall. \nStan and Kyle look nervous. \nSTAN Everyone be seated, please. \nThe kids all sit down. \nKYLE Wow, a lot of people showed up. \nSTAN Yeah, so what do we say? \nKYLE I thought you had something planned. \nSTAN Me?! \nStan looks out over the faces.

So we think we should prank call a bunch of policemen! We can have pizzas sent to them that they didn't order! VIVA LA RESISTANCE!!! \nAgain no response. Gregory rolls his eyes. \nSTAN Uhh... \nGregory stands up. \nGREGORY May I? \nSTAN What? \nGregory takes Stan's place at the front of the group. \nGREGORY Terrance and Phillip are currently being held at a Canadian Internment camp two kilometers outside of town. They are to be executed tomorrow during a star-studded USO show for the troops. \nGregory pulls a big map out of nowhere and rolls it out. Stan and Kyle can't believe it. \nGREGORY We must sneak into the camp through this duct, freeing Terrance and Phillip inside... The war is escalating, and the American forces are preparing for a large scale attack on Canada. That means the time is now... \nKYLE Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart. \nStan shoots Kyle a dirty look. \nGREGORY This is a dangerous mission, so I'll go myself. \nWendy smiles at Gregory. \nSTAN No! \nEveryone looks at Stan. \nSTAN WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going! \nGREGORY This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure? \nCARTMAN Fuck that! (BZZT) AGAGH!! \nSTAN We're going...

SOUTH PARK - AMERICAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS \nA huge hall is filled with hundreds of soldiers in different battalions. \nWe see our regulars: Mr. Garrison with a uniformed Mr. Hat, Mr. Mackey, Jimbo and Ned, Bo, Pip, Stan's Grandfather, Jesus, Officer Barbrady.... \nJIMBO Oh, I'm so glad there's a war again. I was gettin' worried I'd never see another one! \nNED I know what you mean. \nJIMBO And they're giving all us troops a big USO tomorrow with celebrities and executions! \nPAN OVER to Mr. Garrison. \nMR.

GARRISON Boy, I can't wait for our first shore- leave so I can go get me some poontang. \nChef sits down in a seat behind Garrison near the back. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN, a gruff old army type with bug eyes, steps up to a podium and addresses the troops. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN PAY ATTENTION! \nThe crowd settles down. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN It's no secret that the Evil Canadian Federation has scored major victories all over the United State.  We have brought you here because you ar America's best, and last hope. \nAnother general leans over to Plymkin and whispers in his ear. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN Oh... Apparently you're not the best, you're simply the last. Anyway, let's strategize... Map! \nA large, holographic 3-D map of South Park springs up in front of him.  He walks around it pointing out things with a laser-pointer. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN Our sources have told us that the Canadians might try to attach tomorrow's USO show and stop us from executing Terrance and Phillip. \nHe points to a spot on the 3-D map. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN Now each battalion has a specific code- name and mission.  Battalion 5, raise your hands- \nChef is in Battalion 5 and dutifully raises his hand. \nThen he looks around and notices to his surprise that everybody else in his section is also African American. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN You will be the all-important first defense wave, which we will call 'Operation Human Shield'. \nCHEF Hey, wait a minute... \nGENERAL PLYMKIN Now keep in mind, 'Operation Human Shield' will suffer heavy losses.  But don't lose your spirit men!  Stay until the bitter end.  Battalion 14? \nA bunch of white guys raise their hands. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN Right, you are 'Operation Get Behind The Darkies'.  You will follow Battalion 5 here- \nHe points to a spot on the 3-D map. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN -and try not to get killed for God's Sake.  Are there any questions men? \nChef raises his hand. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN Yes soldier? \nCHEF Have you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation? \nGENERAL PLYMKIN I don't listen to hip-hop. \nChef scowls. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN If you somehow live, we will regroup on this hill outside-- \n", "test2_id": 1486, "test3_input": "Saddam looks around and is suddenly scared.

I want to talk about it now! \nSaddam grabs Satan by the arm. \nSATAN Ow, you're hurting me! \nSADDAM HUSSEIN Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!

All he wanted was sex.  But it took me so long to figure that out. \nHe starts to cry.  Chef hands him a hanky. \nCHEF Here you go Satan- \nSATAN Thank you.

Look! \nKyle points to the sky.  Everyone looks up just in time to see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky. \nWe follow the shooting star and then slowly ZOOM in on it. As we get closer, we realize it is actually Kenny, shooting towards the heavens. \nAs TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays, Kenny's little body floats up and up through the clouds. (NOTE:  This will also be done in 3-D CGI) \nRays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into the warmth of the baby blueness. \nAngels encircle him and give him a pair of wings.  They smile gently.  He feels calm.  He feels good. \n", "test3_id": 1487}

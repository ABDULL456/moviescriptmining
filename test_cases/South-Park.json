A wooden sign tells us this is South Park. \nEXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY \nBirds fly into the air, TOWNSPEOPLE smile to each other as they walk by. \nIt is a scene reminiscent of, if not directly ripped off from, the opening number of 'Beauty and the Beast'. \nA little eight year old boy walks happily down the street. He is STAN MARSH, a noble looking boy with piercing blue eyes and a strong chin. As he walks, he sings a happy song. \nSTAN I'm going to the movies To see the brighter side of life! I'm going to the movie Everything's gonna be alright! Forget all my troubles Put my own life on hold Let a studio tell me how I should view the world Where everything works out I love it that way I'm going to the movies The movies today! \nStan merrily walks up to a crappy looking house. \nINT. BEDROOM - MORNING \nWe are in a young boy's bedroom, just as his alarm clock goes off. BRRRRRTTT!!! \nRADIO ANNOUNCER Good morning South Park! It's five-thirty a.m. on Sunday!! Time to feed the horses and water the cows!! \nFrom the back, we see the blond haired kid sit up from his bed. He stretches, and then walks over to his closet. \nWe still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his closet and pulls out an orange coat. \nThe kid puts his coat on, then turns to camera and pulls the hood shut, so that we never get a good look at his face. \nMOTHER (O.S.) KENNY! YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH!!! \nThis boy's name is KENNY, and under his orange coat, we have no idea what he looks like, except for his European nose and hazel eyes. \nKENNY Mph rmph rm! \nINT. KENNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN \nKenny walks through his small, dirty house and into the kitchen, where his MOTHER, FATHER and OLDER BROTHER are sitting at the humble table. \nKENNY'S MOTHER Sit down, you can share some of your brother's waffle. \nThe doorbell rings. Kenny walks over to the door. \nEXT. KENNY'S HOUSE - DAY \nKenny opens the door to find Stan. \nSTAN Kenny! The Terrance and Phillip movie is out! You wanna come?! \nStan shows Kenny a newspaper clipping. It's an ad for the new Terrance and Phillip movie 'Asses of fire'. Kenny's eyes light up. \nKENNY Mph rmph rm, rmph! \nKenny walks away with Stan. His mother comes out after him. \nKENNY'S MOTHER Kenny! Where're you going? \nKENNY Mph mprh mprh rm! \nKENNY'S MOTHER What do you mean you don't want to go to church? \nKENNY Mrmph, rmph rmph rm rmph. \nKenny and Stan walk down the street. \nKENNY'S MOTHER Well fine, go ahead and miss church!! And then when you die and go to hell you can ANSWER TO SATAN!! \nDramatic MUSIC STING. Kenny stops, thinks for a minute... And then walks off with Stan anyway. \nEXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY \nStan and Kenny now both happily march down the street to the happy beat. \nTOM, a plastic surgeon, peeps his head out the door of his Rhinoplasty office. \nTOM Say, where are you boys going? \nSTAN We're going to the movies! To see the brighter side of life! Where everyone is beautiful And have their hair combed just right! \nKENNY Mph rmph rm rmph rm! Mph rm rmph rm! Mprh rm rmph rm rm Rmph rm rmph rm rmph! \nTOM Have fun you rascals! \nEXT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY \nKenny and Stan knock at the door. \nA handsome eight year old Semite, KYLE, answers the door. \nKYLE Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny? \nSTAN Kyle, check it out. \nKenny holds up the newspaper clipping. \nKYLE OH MY GOD, DUDE!!! \nKyle slips on his coat and heads out the door. But just then, Kyle's little brother, IKE, a two year old adopted Canadian boy bounces up next to him. \nKYLE No, Ike! You can't come with me! \n", "test1_true": "KYLE'S MOTHER Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you! \nKYLE Aw, ma!! \nKYLE'S MOTHER Do as I say, Kyle! \nKyle's mother closes the door. \nKYLE Damn it!! \nEXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY \nNow the three boys, and little Ike, merrily strut down the street and sing in unison. \nBOYS We're going to the movies To see the better side of life Where something interesting happens Every day and night! \nKYLE In movies we can pretend That love is real and good always wins- \nSTAN We can even make believe marriages last! \nA HOMELESS guy is lying in the alley. \nHOMELESS GUY Spare a dollar? Spare a dollar? \nStan walks by and throws a dollar at him. The homeless guy suddenly jumps up. \nHOMELESS GUY I'm going to the movies! To see the brighter side of life! I'm going to the movies Everything's gonna be alright! Forget my troubles Put my own life on hold Let a studio tell me how to view the world! \nKYLE Let's go get fat ass! \nEXT. ANOTHER HOUSE - DAY \nThis house looks just like all the others. \nINT. THAT SAME HOUSE \nCLOSE UP on a bag that reads 'CHEESY POOFS'. A hand reaches into the bag, pulls out a wad of orange crunchies and raises them -- \nBOOM UP to reveal the fat face of eight year old ERIC CARTMAN who chows down on the chips. \nNow we see that fat little Eric is sitting on his couch, eating Cheesy Poofs and watching television. \nThe doorbell rings. Cartman doesn't move a muscle. \nCARTMAN MOM! SOMEBODY'S AT THE DOOR! \nCARTMAN'S MOTHER enters. She is extremely June Cleaveresque (except that she's a hermaphrodite crack whore). She returns with Stan, Kyle and Kenny. \nCARTMAN'S MOTHER Look, Eric it's your little friends. \nCARTMAN What the hell are you guys doing here? \nIKE Baba turtre bad! \nKyle holds up the newspaper ad. \nCARTMAN Ooh! \nEXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE \nNow all four boys are merrily walking down the street and singing. \nBOYS We're going to the movies To see the better side of life! \nCARTMAN Maybe there'll be pirates! Or a whole city burnin'! Maybe we'll see a monster Or, better yet, Uma Thurman! \nBOYS We're going to the movies! Everything's gonna be okay! \nThe boys skip out of frame. \nEXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY \nThe movie theatre is nestled neatly between two other South Park buildings. \nThe boys walk up to the geeky, teenage TICKET GUY. \nBOYS Going to the movies! The movies today!!!!! \nSTAN Can I get five tickets to Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire, please? \nTICKET GUY No. \nSuddenly, all the happy music that has permeated the film comes to an ABRUPT HALT. \nThe boys look confused. \nKYLE What'dya mean, no? \nTICKET GUY Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire is rated 'R'. You kids can't get in. \nThe boys look shocked. They just stand there, in silence. \nCARTMAN The hell we can't! My money is just as good as any white person's! \nTICKET GUY You have to be accompanied by a parent or guardian. \nKYLE But why? \nTICKET GUY Because this movie has naughty language, and it might make you kids start using bad words. \nCARTMAN Listen you son of a bitch, if you don't let us in to see this movie I'm gonna kick you square in the nuts. \nTICKET GUY Sorry, Charlie. \nKYLE Damn it! \nTICKET GUY Next, please? \nA few TEENAGERS walk up to get their tickets. The boys step aside. \nSTAN This is terrible! This can't be happening!! \n", "test1_id": 1485, "test2_input": "Tents and makeshift buildings are lined up against the mountains.  Jeeps and Tanks buzz to and fro. \nThere's a huge stage which is set up with thousands of seats. There's a giant banner reading \"USO SHOW TONIGHT!!!!!\" \nLoads of soldiers file into their seats. \nANNOUNCER Alright you men! The USO show is about to start!! \nThe military men go wild. \nANNOUNCER Get ready for loads of entertainment and fabulous celebrities! To be followed immediately by the swift and nasty execution of Terrance and Elroy! \nThe crowd goes crazy again. \nEXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - BEHIND THE USO SHOW - DUSK \nRight out of Nazi Germany.  Barbed wire, guards, the whole bit. \nANGLE ON BOYS \nThey are on their backs, shimmying along the ground underneath the blanket of razor-wire that is set up around the camp. \nThe Mole uses the bolt-cutters to cut the wire as he goes, clearing a path for Stan, Kyle and Cartman. \nTHE MOLE Be careful not to touch this wire- \nA wire catches on Cartman's arm and SNAPS against his face. \nCARTMAN OW!  MOTHERFUCKER! \nBZZAAAAT!!! \nCARTMAN FUC- \nStan shoves his hand over Cartman's mouth, leaving Cartman to cuss bloody murder into Stan's glove. \nCARTMAN MPHMPH MPHMPHMPH!!! \nBZAAT! \nCARTMAN MMMPPPHHH!!! \nFinally they clear the fence and lie down in view of the camp. \nTHE MOLE It sounds like the USO show has started. We have precious little time... \nKyle looks at the horrible concentration camp. \nKYLE Oh my God... \nTHE MOLE God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all. \nKyle looks at The Mole, oddly. \nSTAN How are we ever gonna find them? \nThe Mole whips out some night vision goggles. \nANGLE ON INTERMENT CAMP THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES \nThe Mole inspects the camp.  He sees a guard on a guard tower.  Then he pans over to a bunch of Canadians standing in a line in rags. \nThe Mole quickly clicks the magnification to high so we see the saddened faces of the Canadians. \nKYLE Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip? \nTHE MOLE No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig. \nKYLE That's gonna take a long time! \nTHE MOLE Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King? \nThe boys think. \nEXT. USO SHOW - DAY \nHelicopters zoom over the makeshift stage like the USO show in Apocalypse Now. \nGroups of soldiers cheer as a helicopter approaches the landing platform and touches down.  The US army men cheer. \nThe mothers take the stage, and Kyle's mother speaks into the microphone. Behind her is a huge American flag. She is wearing an army helmet. This is right out of 'Patton'. \nKYLE'S MOTHER Ladies and gentlemen of the American war effort, we salute you! \nA big cheer goes through the crowd. Kyle's mother feels the power, and lifts her head high. She starts to pace back and forth on the stage as she speaks, becoming more and more Pattonlike. \nKYLE'S MOTHER Tomorrow you will be risking your lives so that our children will have a better future... God bless you men. And God bless this filth free nation. Many of you will die. Die like blood bathed pigs.  So tonight, we at MAC present a NIGHT OF A HUNDRED STARS! Now without further ado, I give you... \nOut of the helicopter emerge a battalion of the best and brightest stars that the American show biz industry has to offer. \nKYLE'S MOTHER Pint size pixie and darling of the indie movie scene, Winona Ryder! \nShe gestures grandly to the helicopter where Winona Ryder emerges and runs to center stage and waves to the audience. She looks like a strung out coke addict; because she is. \nWINONA RYDER Hi guys!  I'm T.V.'s Winona Ryder! \nOne guy claps. \nWINONA RYDER I want you all to know I'm super psyched to be here today.  You guys rock.  What you're doing for our country so sooo cool.  It's so real.  I've been acting since I was twelve and I can't distinguish between make believe and real life. \nWinona falls down. But gets back up immediately. \nWINONA RYDER And then I confuse me real life with my big-screen one.  And sure, people get hurt, and I'm sorry about that but Christ, look at me.  It's not my fault that I can get any guy I want.  And that's reality to me.  But you guys... wow.  I mean, war, man. Fucking war.  It doesn't get any more real--  Now, this one goes out to you. \nShe cues the band which has been assembled from the same helicopter.  Jazz music starts up. \nIt's 'New York, New York'. The troops look confused. \nWINONA RYDER You know what I'm gonna do for you now, don't you? \n'New York, New York' continues to play. \n", "test2_true": "INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - BELOW THE USO SHOW \nThe mole is digging frantically while the boys follow on all fours.  Cartman holds a flashlight. \nCARTMAN Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff. \nTHE MOLE Sheet! \nSTAN What is it? \nTHE MOLE Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction! \nSTAN We're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days.  Dry up into crunchy little pinkies. \nThe boys stare. \nA beat. \nTHE MOLE Or, we can dig UP. \nThe mole starts digging up towards the ground. \nEXT. INSIDE THE PRISON CAMP \nMole pops his head out of the ground. Immediately, a search light passes over the hole. \nTHE MOLE Sheet! \nMole ducks, just avoiding the light. \nSlowly, the boys' heads appear from the hole. \nThe whole camp is in front of them.  There is a HUGE barbedwire fence on one side (the side they just dug from)  A dozen armed guards with huge Dobermans patrol the grounds with Howitzers.  It doesn't look good. \nTHE MOLE Move! Move! \nOne by one, The Mole, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman pop out of the ground, and run for a nearby building.  Once at the building, they all duck to avoid the search lights. \nTHE MOLE Okay.... The Americans must be holding Terrance and Phillip in one of those bunkers. We will split up here.  Let's synchronize watches! \nThe others look at each other. \nKYLE We don't have watches. \nA beat. \nTHE MOLE You don't have watches? \nSTAN Dude, you didn't say anything about watches. \nTHE MOLE What do you think this is kid?  Lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking kiddie hour?  Huh?  This is real life with consequences you take to the grave! \nKYLE Dude, we don't have watches. \nTHE MOLE Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror? \nSTAN Got it. \nTHE MOLE And ze rope? \nSTAN Check. \nTHE MOLE And the butfor? \nKYLE What's a butfor? \nTHE MOLE For pooping, silly. \nA beat... Then mole takes a long drag off his cigarette and slowly blows the smoke. \nTHE MOLE Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe. \nKYLE What's a dying giraffe sound like? \nTHE MOLE (Putting his hands to his mouth) Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa. \nKYLE Kay. \nThe Mole turns to Cartman. \nTHE MOLE Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it? \nCARTMAN Okay. \nTHE MOLE You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa- \nCARTMAN I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE! \nCartman storms off. \nTHE MOLE I will tunnel my way into ze buildings, and find ze prisoners. \nThe Mole starts to dig. \nKYLE Be careful, dude. \nTHE MOLE Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb? \nAnd with that, The Mole quickly starts to tunnel his way underground. \nSTAN Damn, dude, that kid is fucked up. \nEXT. STAGE - NIGHT \nBack on stage at the USO show.  Winona Ryder is just finishing up her song. \nWINONA RYDER (Singing) ....It's a hell of a TOWN!  And that's my New York Melodyyyyyy!!!! \nThe band finishes with a flourish. Winona takes a bow. \nOne person in the entire audience claps. \n", "test2_id": 1486, "test3_input": "Wendy pulls Stan up off the ground and slings his arm around her. \nEXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT \nA drummer plays as the execution begins. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN We begin with Terrance and Phillip!!! Throw the switch!!! \nThe executioner throws the switch and Terrance and Phillip start to fry. Kyle, Cartman and Ike, in their chairs, look horrified. \nKYLE'S MOTHER Goodbye, bastards! \nNear death, Terrance cranks out a weak fart. Terrance and Phillip both laugh weakly but merrily. \nTERRANCE Take that, bitch. \nAs Terrance and Phillip fry, they scream out: \nPHILLIP/TERRANCE FREEEEEEDOMMMMM!!! \nSuddenly, FWWOOOMMM!!! A Bomb lands in the middle of the army. BLAM!! It explodes with incredible force, sending dead bodies in all directions. \nCanadian military planes zoom overhead! It's a full scale attack!! \nFrom a HIGH ANGLE we see the soldiers all scatter like bugs in every direction. \nMR. GARRISON THE CANADIANS ARE ATTACKING!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!! \nFWWOOMM!!! BLAMM!! Another explosion!  Everybody just starts screaming and shooting in every direction.  Total and complete mayhem. \nOne explosion knocks out the electricity, and Terrance and Phillip stop drying. \nThe electricity runs along a wire, across the stage, and right up Cartman's leg. Cartman starts frying horribly. \nKYLE CARTMAN! \nCARTMAN (Frying) WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!! \nPHILLIP What's going on Terrance? \nTERRANCE Canada is saving us!! \nFinally, Cartman is blown clear of the electricity. Kyle picks him up and starts to run along with Ike. \nINT. HELL - SATAN'S BEDROOM \nSatan opens the door to find Saddam sleeping happily in his cozy bed. He is only wearing little black g-string panties. \nSATAN (Whispering) Have you finished? \nNow we see that Kenny is standing at the foot of the bed. He holds a gasoline can, and has just finished pouring the last drops underneath the bed. \nKENNY Mph mph. \nSATAN Then move out of the way. \nKenny walks over next to Satan. Satan pulls out a book of matches. \nSATAN I must be strong... I must be strong... \nSatan tries to light the match. It won't light. \nSATAN Damn it... \nFinally, the match lights. Satan holds it up- \nSATAN Goodbye, Saddam... \n-and throws it onto the bed. \nSATAN Come on! \nSaddam burns to a crisp and Satan and Kenny run out. \nEXT. USO SHOW - DAY \nPeople run screaming in all directions as a full scale attack has broken out. Gunfire, explosions and dead bodies fly all around. \nJIMBO Ned!  Behind you! \nNed whips around and mows down a line of Canadians. But one Canadian makes it through, and sticks his bayonet through Ned's neck. \nBlood gushes from Ned's neck as he collapses. \nJIMBO NED!!! NOOOOOOO!!!!! \nFWWOOM!! BLAMMM!!! The boys runs as fast as they can amidst the explosions. \nCARTMAN HOLY SHIT! (Zap) AGHAGHGAH!! \nNow when the V-chip shocks Cartman, we can actually see the blue current swirl around his body. \nCARTMAN HEY! THIS V-CHIP IS GETTING ALL SCREWY!! \nGeneral Plymkin has followed his men into the trench, where explosions and gunfire fly all around. He pulls out a walkie talkie as his men die all around him. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN ALRIGHT MEN!!!  FALL INTO FORMATION! \"HUMAN SHIELD\" UP FRONT THEN \"OPERATION GET BEHIND THE DARKIES\"!!! \nThey all fall in.  A phalanx of black men, Chef included in them, walk out in front of a bunch of white guys. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN REMEMBER, HUMAN SHIELD!  PROTECT OUR TANKS AND PLANES, TOO! \nJust then, over a ridge in front of them, a line of Canadian tanks appears. The tanks are lined up 3 deep.  Behind them is a line of missile launchers.  General Plymkin's jaw drops. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN Holy Mother of Johosephat... \nThe black guys all look at each other nervously. \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD \nThe boys run through the chaos.  Body parts and scrapnel fly here and there. \n", "test3_true": "KYLE Hey! It's Mr. Garrison!! \nGarrison lies on the ground, coughing up blood. \nMR. GARRISON Children... Take Mr. Hat... Please... Get him out of here... \nGarrison takes Mr. Hat off his hand and gives it to Cartman. \nJust then, Garrison goes limp. \nCartman looks at the Mr. Hat in his hand and scowls. The boys run from the battle. \nThey pass the American troops, where all the black guys are standing in a human shield around the white guys. \nCHEF Alright, squad... JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU... ONE!! \nThe Canadian tanks take aim. \nCHEF TWO! \nThe Canadian tanks fire. \nCHEF THREE!! \nAll the black guys suddenly jump out of the way, leaving the whites completely exposed. \nGENERAL PLYMKIN What the- \nThe tank fire hits the army, blowing all the white soldiers to smithereens, including Ned and Jimbo. \nBLACK SOLDIER GREAT PLAN, CHEF! \nCHEF Operation Human Shield my ASS! \nEXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY \nFrom an EXTREME WIDE SHOT, we see all the forces on both sides exchange firepower. The Canadian National anthem can be heard in the distance. \nWe see Mr. Mackey looking like a natural born killer.  He shoots like a maniac into the Canadians.  He wounds one and then marches over to the wriggling body with a knife. \nMR. MACKEY Die Canadian, mmkay?! \nAnd he drives the knife into the Canadian's chest. \nBut then, suddenly, another Canadian Soldier appears out of nowhere, and blows a hole through Mackey's chest. \nMR. MACKEY Mkay- \nMackey falls to the ground, dead. Just then Big Gay Al runs through the frame, we FOLLOW him as he skips his way around gunfire. \nBIG GAY AL Ooh! Goodness those bullets are going FAST!!! \nAnother bullet zings by his head. \nBIG GAY AL Jumping Jesus, this is insane!! \nTHUMP! A bullet hits Big Gay Al square in the head. More bullets follow, tearing him to shreds. \nWIDE ANGLE ON - ENTIRE BATTLE \nThis shot parodies one of the big shots from 'Saving Private Ryan'. Just complete overkill. Explosions, helicopters, gunfire and death. \nKyle's mother, and the other mothers as well, stand on a ridge overlooking the horrific massacre. \nSTAN'S MOTHER My God... This is terrible... \nKyle's mother holds out her M-16. She is now completely insane. \nKYLE'S MOTHER This is what we wanted! We wanted our children to be brought up in a smut-free environment!!! \nKENNY'S MOTHER But we didn't want THIS. I just followed you 'cause I made a shitload of money selling Kenny t-shirts! \nSTAN'S MOTHER Oh Lord, what have we done...? \nKYLE'S MOTHER Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals? \nThe other mothers look very confused. \nKYLE'S MOTHER Why does it matter?! My plan is a perfect plan!!  Perfect!  Perfect! Perfect!!!!! \nThe other mothers walk away. \nKYLE'S MOTHER WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals! \nSTAN'S MOTHER We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!! \nKyle's mother turns back to the battle. More killing and explosions. \nKYLE'S MOTHER Killed.  They should only be so lucky. Kyle wasn't even BORN in a hospital! \nShe charges the field. \nEXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS \nTerrance and Phillip are dodging gunfire and super loud explosions. \nPHILLIP Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted! \nTERRANCE You did? Just now? \nThey laugh merrily. \nPHILLIP Come on, we can take shelter in one of those buildings! \nBut just then, Kyle's mother comes charging in with her gun!! \nKYLE'S MOTHER AAAGHGAHGHGH!!! YOU DESTROYED MY FAMILY!!!!!!!!!! \nPhillip spins around just in time to see Kyle's mother plunge her bayonet into Terrance's abdomen. \nTERRANCE AGH! \n", "test3_id": 1487}

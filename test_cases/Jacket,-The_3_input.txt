INT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, EVENING 
MACKENZIE looks up from his game of solitaire as LORENSON helps STARKS down the hall. He holds up his hand in the gesture of hello, or goodbye. 
STARKS raises his hand back with an earnest smile. 
STARKS I'm telling you my story because it's the only way I can try to help your daughter, and you, have a better one of your own. 
INT. BECKER'S HOME, SHELBOURNE, 1992 
We see BECKER taking his DRUGS. In his dark den, on his worn desk, is a bottle of WHISKEY. He closes his eyes as he administers to himself whatever aid he can... 
INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, DECEMBER 31, 1992 
JEAN is reading each page avidly, affected by this man's last words. 
STARKS (V.O.) It's scary...and lucky...how much we can forget. Scary because we think the past gives us our bearing, and lucky because in those moments I'm talking about, you realize it doesn't. And it never had to. 
INT. SMALL BAR, CANADA, NIGHT, 1992 
TENNY (Officer Harrison's murderer) is at the bar ordering a drink from the BARTENDER. As he gets his DRINK, he slaps a BILL down on the counter and turns around to survey the bar... 
INT. JACKIE'S ROOM, JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, EVENING, 1992 
JACKIE rummages in a box of her personal belongings, looking for something specific in them. She stops finally when she finds STARKS' DOG TAGS. She takes them out slowly and puts them around her neck. 
STARKS (V.O.) I am not a crazy man, even though they mistook me for one. I live in the same world as the rest of you. Only I saw more of it. 
Then, after a moment of staring down at them, she tucks them under her sweater. 
INT. CAPTAIN MEDLEY'S HOME, NIGHT, 1992 
CAPTAIN MEDLEY holds a beer as he stares blankly at a TV broadcasting news about MIKE TYSON'S RAPE CONVICTION. Medley's barely watching the footage... 
INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, 1992 
Dr. Lorenson helps Starks back to bed. STARKS looks up at Lorenson, thanking her without words but with his eyes. LORENSON smiles as she looks back sadly at Starks' even more weakened self. 
STARKS (V.O.) And the seeing is the only way you can hear what the truth around you is saying: you can always start believing in things you don't already believing in. And, while you're alive, it's never too late. 
Then he turns and walks out, closing the door so that Starks' room and the screen darken at the same time. 
INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992 
TWO PAIRS of legs walk down a corridor, darkened by the night, through the now familiar passage to the basement... 
STARKS is not restrained this time though we don't see who is walking down the hall with him. He runs his hand over his forehead and looks at it when he's done. STILL NO CUT. 
They slow down their pace as they round the corner, as STARKS appears dizzier and dizzier. He doesn't stop and the PERSON beside him doesn't see how weak he is... until STARKS TRIPS. 
In slow motion, we hear a DISTANT, GARBLED VOICE CALL OUT... 
DISTORTED VOICE No! Wa...atch out! 
But STARKS' head hits the GLASS CASE of the FIRE EXTINGUISHER on the wall, as it was destined to. In the terrific SHOWER OF GLASS, one PIECE cuts a neat, deep, fatal GASH in Starks' head. 
BLOOD starts to flow. As STARKS' eyes struggle to regain their focus, we see the BLURRED, indiscernible FACE of the PERSON leaning over him to see if he's all right. 
The details start to make sense, even to Starks. This is the WOUND they said he died from. 
INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992 
STARKS collapses on the familiar slab, ready to be strapped into the Jacket one final time. BLOOD pours from his head onto the floor. 
The PERSON with him struggles to get all of Starks' weight onto the metal slab. She's doing it as carefully, and gently, as she can -- taking observable care with every strap of the JACKET, almost as if the act itself is a humane one. 
When the HANDS finally reach the straps around his neck and the hardest part of the struggle has passed, STARKS smiles kindly, and thankfully, into the single overhead LIGHT in the room that obscures the face of the person strapping him in. 
As the drawer is pushed in, one of the STRAPS gets caught on the side, CUTTING STARKS' ARM. We hear a small CRY in the room. Then the HANDS adjust the strap and slowly push STARKS in. 
INT. JACKET/TUNNEL 
It's more beautiful and serene inside than it's ever been before. This time, as he travels through the tunnel, it's as though he's traveling in a heaven of his own. The IMAGES he sees are the best moments of his past -- connected in a tranquil, fluid narrative that suggest STARKS has finally retrieved his memory without it haunting him... 
STARKS (V.O.) I promise you, Jean. No matter how bad the days and things around you look, they look better awake than they do asleep. I can offer you some proof: when you die, there's only one thing you want to have happen...sometimes so badly it comes true, I guess. [Beat] You want to come back. 
PANELS: 
The PANELS we saw briefly are completed further now. 
1) C.U. A WOMAN'S NECK as a small child's HAND touches it. 
2) INT. STAIRWAY, OLD HOUSE (STARKS' CHILDHOOD HOME): STARKS, 
aged 9, running up the stairs, knocking a PICTURE on the wall with his elbow... 
3) C.U. A black and white PHOTOGRAPH of Starks' father, a much older version of himself. 
4) EXT. CREEK: A shot of clear water that's not to deep and,

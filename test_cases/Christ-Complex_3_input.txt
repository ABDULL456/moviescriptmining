JACK (O.S.) What the fuck?!? I want to watch Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia in peace! 
QUINN I need to see Zoey. 
ANNA What about tomorrow? Or never is good. 
You hear Zoey off screen. ZOEY (O.S.) What's going on?? 
Zoey comes to the doorway and stands behind Anna. 
ZOEY (CONT'D) Quinn? What's wrong? 
QUINN I need to talk to you, it's important. 
Quinn grabs her by the arm and pulls her outside, pushing her right past Anna. 
ANNA Jesus Christ! 
Anna slams the door shut, leaving Zoey and Quinn outside. 
QUINN I need to tell you everything. Anna is so right. 
ZOEY What are you talking about? Anna is right? 
QUINN I've not been honest with you about what I do...or who I am. 
ZOEY OK? 
QUINN I need to come clean. I want you to trust me. I want your friends to trust me. 
ZOEY (nervous laugh) OK Quinn, just spit it out. 
QUINN OK (beat) I'm an archangel named Moroni and I basically represent "light" or everything that's good. Louis, my friend, represents "darkness". Every seventy years we have to fight to the death. If I win everything stays the way it is. The world continues turning. If I lose, Louis takes on the role of the Antichrist and the apocalypse will be unleashed. I'm talking Book of Revelations stuff here. So I only have a limited time left in this world... (beat) I want to spend that time with you. 
Zoey is stunned, silent. 
ZOEY Oh honey... 
Zoey touches his face. 
ZOEY (CONT'D) You must have a brain tumor or something. You're obviously mentally ill. 
QUINN Zoey? I... 
Zoey puts her finger up to his lips to quiet him. 
ZOEY Shhh. You need me more than ever. 
Zoey reaches down and takes a confused Quinn's hand. She leads him to the door. Like a sheep herder, she takes Quinn inside of the apartment. 
The last image we see is the apartment door slamming behind them.

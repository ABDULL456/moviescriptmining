{"train": "KATE (to Charlie) I love you, baby. I'll be waiting for you in a nice warm bed. You have exactly one mission: get your brother laid -- and don't talk to any other women. \nBeat. \nCHARLIE That sounds like two missions. \nKATE No, it's just one. \nCHARLIE (to Owen) It kinda sounded like two, right? \nOWEN (nodding) It did. \nKate grins and slowly backs away towards the door. \nKATE (really fast) GoodbyeIloveyouboth! \n2   EXT. KARAOKE BAR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT                        2   * \nKate stumbles out of the bar and hears a GROAN. She glances over and sees: \nA drunk woman -- FREDA, 30s -- sitting on the curb. She MOANS again. \nKate glances around the parking lot. Nobody else but her and Freda. \nKATE You okay? \nFREDA (quick) Yeah. Are you? \nKATE (taken aback) Um...sure. \nFREDA Good. (whispers) Hey, I'm not really okay. \nKATE Oh... \nFREDA My bitch sister just took off and left me here so she could hook up with some asshole. Now what am I supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a car here. \nKATE I guess I could... \nFREDA You'll give me a ride? Oh my god! Thank you! \nFreda gets up quickly -- and almost falls over.                   * \nKATE I was gonna say \"call you a cab,\" `cause, you know -- I don't even know you. \nFREDA It's not far. Please? Pretty please...? \nKate looks dismayed. Not sure what to do. \nCUT TO: \n3   INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - NIGHT                             3   * \nThe car passes through Chinatown on its way downtown.             * \nKate drives with Freda in the passenger seat. Freda glances down at the floor and notices a FLASK.                            * \nFREDA You know, you shouldn't drink and drive. \nKATE I wasn't -- \nFREDA Just kidding. Can I have a sip? \nKate's speechless. \nFREDA (CONT'D) I'm really thirsty. \nKATE It's, uh...whiskey. \nFREDA Fuck yeah, it's whiskey! I love whiskey. You're the real thing, huh? A hardcore drinking bitch like me! \nFreda takes a swig from Kate's flask. \nKATE I don't know. No. \nFREDA Can I smoke in your car? \n5    EXT. DOWNTOWN - SIDEWALK - DAWN                               5 \nKate is asleep on the curb. She looks awful. Suddenly, Kate's eyes widen. She looks around at her surroundings, confused, then jumps to her feet. \n6    EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREETS - DAWN                                6 \nKate runs through the streets. \n6A   EXT.

From out of nowhere --                  * \n-- Kate appears at the end of the street and sprints towards      * the camera.                                                       * \nA LEGEND APPEARS OVER THE IMAGE OF KATE RUNNING: \n\"SMASHED\" \n7    INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAWN                              7 \nKate drives -- a paranoid expression on her face and her hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. She glances down at -- \n-- her CELL PHONE in the passenger seat. 21 missed calls. \nShe passes various sites on her way from downtown to Highland     * Park.                                                             * \n8   EXT.

KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY/KITCHEN - 9     * MORNING \nKate walks into the kitchen to find -- \n-- Charlie asleep at the kitchen table. CELL PHONE next to his head. Empty BEER BOTTLES litter the table. \nKate tip-toes across the kitchen. \nCharlie quickly jerks up. \nCHARLIE (confused) Huh?! \nKATE Shhh...it's okay, baby. Go back to sleep. \nCHARLIE What happened? I came home and you were gone and I waited and waited. \nKATE It's a long story. \nCHARLIE I was worried. I kept calling you. \nKATE I ended up... \nCharlie SNIFFS Kate. \nCHARLIE You smell funny. What do you smell like? \nKATE I fell asleep in my car. Near the bar. I was too drunk to drive. \nCHARLIE So, why didn't you come back or call me? \nKATE Charlie -- (beat) -- I'm fine. \nCHARLIE Well, maybe I'm not. I worry, baby. I love you -- and you know how you get sometimes. \nKATE I love you too. But I'm home. It's over. I gotta get to work. \nCHARLIE I can't be worried about you all the time. \nKate rubs Charlie's hair and kisses his forehead. \nKATE Don't worry so much. I'm fine. (beat) C'mon -- let me get you to bed. \nHillary shuffles up to the board and writes \"CAN.\"              * \nKATE (CONT'D) Great job, Hillary -- let's give                      * her a round of applause! \nThe class APPLAUDS. \nHillary smiles and goes back to her seat.                       * \nKATE (CONT'D) Can anyone use \"can\" in a sentence? \nA student -- ANGELA -- raises her hand. \nKATE (CONT'D) Yes? \nANGELA \"Hurry up in there -- I gotta use the can!\" \nThe students GIGGLE. \nKATE (quickly moving on) Wonderful, Angela. You get a Camaro with flames painted on the hood. \nThe students CHEER. \nKATE (CONT'D) Now -- (to the class) -- what's another word I could make by adding a letter to \"an\"? \nNobody raises their hand. \nKATE (CONT'D) C'mon... \nFinally, a student in the back -- RAMON -- raises his hand. \nKATE (CONT'D) Yes -- Ramon? \nRAMON P. \nKATE P...okay, what word would that make if I added a \"P\"? \nRAMON Um...pan? \nKATE Pan! That's right. Ramon Martinez...COME ON DOWN! \nRamon walks up and begins to write \"PAN.\" \nKATE (CONT'D) Wow! Just look at that excellent penman -- \nKate stops suddenly and raises her hand to her mouth. She quickly runs behind her desk, leans over, and discretely -- \n-- VOMITS on the floor! \nRamon -- who's just inches from the pool of vomit -- looks horrified. \nKate glances up from behind her desk to see -- \n-- the kids all make grossed-out faces and say things like -- \nKIDS EW! GRODY! GROSS! YUCK! IT SMELLS LIKE CHEESE! SLOPPY JOE! GRANDPA! SHRIMP! BACON! \nEmbarrassed, Kate quickly gets TISSUES from her desk and begins cleaning up the mess. \nKATE (to the class) I'm so sorry you had to see that. \nHILLARY stands up.                                                * \nHILLARY                                       * Mrs. Hannah -- are you pregnant? \nKATE What? \nHILLARY                                       * My mommy threw up when she was pregnant with my little sister. Are you pregnant? \nSome of the kids begin WHISPERING (saying things like \"Ooh!\" \"She's gonna have a baby.\"). \nRAMON Are you? \nKate seems flustered and says -- \nKATE Yes. \nKATE Yeah, right. \nCHARLIE Remember when I was shit-faced and took that Q & A pamphlet from there? \nKATE (laughs) Holy shit! And we answered \"yes\" to like every question and at the end it was like, \"If you answered `yes' to any of these you're an alcoholic!\" \nCHARLIE Yeah... (nostalgic) ...that was fun, wasn't it? \nKate smiles and nods. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Hey -- \nCharlie gestures to the street. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) -- look out for that crack! \nKate looks down but sees nothing. \nKATE What crack? \nCHARLIE Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a crack there... (grins) ...but you must have smoked it last night. \nKate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away. Kate chases after him. \n20   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER           20 \nWhile an old 70's R & B song plays on a RECORD PLAYER, which is next to STACKS AND STACKS OF RECORDS -- \n-- Kate and Charlie drunkenly slow dance, drink WINE, and        * LAUGH at an AA PAMPHLET. \nCHARLIE \"Have you missed days of work or school because of drinking?\" \nKATE Absolutely. \nCHARLIE \"Do you envy people who can drink without getting into trouble?\" \nKATE Envy isn't exactly the right word... \nCHARLIE \"Do you have `blackouts'?\" \nKATE Yeah, but who doesn't? \nCHARLIE \"Has your drinking caused trouble at home?\" \nKATE No! We're great. \nCHARLIE Yeah. Definitely. But we still had a lot of \"yes\" answers. (refers to pamphlet) Yep...we still qualify as drunks. \nKATE I'm gonna go! \nCHARLIE (disbelief) Yeah, right. \nKATE No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go. What time is it? \nCHARLIE Eight. \nKate gets up. \nKATE See ya. \nCHARLIE (doesn't believe her) Uh-huh... \nKate takes a big sip of wine. \nKATE (quite serious) This is me: going. \nCharlie LAUGHS -- he doesn't buy it. \nCHARLIE You've been boozing. \nKATE So? You should come too! \nCharlie LAUGHS. \nCHARLIE Yeah, right. You can't go to AA wasted. It's like a rule or something. \nKATE (not picking up the hint) I like drinking is the thing. I mean, I don't want to say you guys are wrong or anything... \nKate nervously LAUGHS. \nSome of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate. \nTATTOO MAN Thank you -- we're all here to help. We do have to move on, though. \nThe woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down. \nLILY                                      * Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be plenty of time to tell your story. \nA young woman -- AMBER, 22 -- approaches the podium. \nAMBER Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't really believe that it's been five years. I mean, my life was a mess back then. Now I'm back in school, I have an amazing man, I love my parents -- it's crazy... \nKATE (way too loud) How old is that girl?! Can she even go to bars? (to Amber) How old are you, Amber? \nSHANA                                      * Be respectful. \nKate seems surprised at being chastised. \nAMBER (gaining intensity) Um...okay? It's because I did the work. I got down on my knees and prayed every night! I went to a meeting everyday! \nKATE Everyday? \nAMBER It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say, I owe everything to AA. Well, AA -- and God, of course! \nThe whole room APPLAUDS. \nLATER \nEveryone is standing, holding hands, and saying the SERENITY PRAYER. \nEVERYONE God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change -- courage to change the things I can - - and wisdom to know the difference. \nKATE AMEN! \nEveryone turns and looks at Kate. \nKATE (CONT'D) (embarrassed) Okay...I think I'm good. \nKate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived. \n22   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT               22 \nKate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER. \nKATE So much for that. \nKate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss- crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN FURNITURE. \nThey drunkenly play CROQUET.                                      * \nCHARLIE Was it a bunch of old biker guys? \nKATE No, it was...I don't know. Enthusiastic people. A lot of really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE! \nCHARLIE Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm sorry it wasn't cool. \nCharlie thinks for a moment. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) I can't really imagine never drinking. I guess I don't have to, though -- (beat) -- you're the one with the problem. \nKate nods in agreement.                                           * \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Hey -- I love you. I don't want you to have to drink. \nKATE I don't have to drink. (beat) I just really like to drink.                            * \nCHARLIE (sincere) Good -- `cause you're my favorite person to drink with in the whole damn world. \nCharlie leans in to kiss Kate. They make out for a moment, and then Kate... \n...BITES Charlie's lip. Charlie pulls back, shocked. Kate grins mischievously. \nCLERK Look -- why don't you get a bottle of water or a coffee or something instead? \nKATE Water or coffee? Fuck you. What -- just cause I won't suck your dick? \nCLERK (had enough) Oh my god. Okay, enough -- you gotta go. \nKate doesn't budge. \nCLERK (CONT'D) Seriously, Kate. You should go. \nKATE Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! \nKate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with tears. \nKATE (CONT'D) This is bullshit! (beat) I have to pee. \nKate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door - - but it's locked. She hides from view, and then squats down and begins to pull up her robe. \nCLERK What the fuck are you doing?! \nKATE (caught) I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just have to pee really, really bad.                         * \nCLERK (frustrated) Get outta here NOW! \nKATE (pleads) C'mon...can't we drink together? \nThe clerk clearly isn't going to budge. Kate nods, resigned, and then... \n...grabs a BOTTLE OF WINE and dashes out the door. \n27   EXT. L.A. RIVER - DAWN                                       27 \nKate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles River. The empty bottle of (screw top) wine is next to her. \nKate's bicycle lays in some weeds nearby. \nA bird SQUAWKS. \nKate slowly wakes up, confused, and in a zombie-like state she gets up and trudges home, wheeling along her bike. \n28   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING              28 \nKate is awakened by the deafeningly loud ALARM CLOCK and the sound of a news radio ANNOUNCER. She looks at the clock and realizes that -- \n-- it's 7:30. \nShe jumps out of bed in a panic. \nKATE Charlie! \nKate pauses when she realizes her back is wet. She looks down at the bed, which is -- \n-- COMPLETELY SOAKED. \nKATE (CONT'D) (mumbled) Not again. \nHalf-asleep, Charlie rolls over onto the pee-soaked part of the bed. \nCHARLIE Come back to bed, baby. \nKATE I have to go to work. You snoozed my alarm again. I'm gonna be late. \nCHARLIE Well, you peed on me so I guess                     * we're even.                                         * \nKATE I have a weak bladder. \nCHARLIE Well...I can't go to work like this. \nKATE You work from our kitchen. \nCHARLIE Yeah, but changing the sheets is my real job. (beat) Hey -- where were you last night? \nKATE Huh? \nCHARLIE I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you were gone. \nKATE (CONT'D) I puked in front of my class and then told everyone I'm pregnant. That's not really okay, huh? \nMR. DAVIES No, I don't think so. \nKATE I went to AA last night. \nMR. DAVIES (slightly uncomfortable) Oh, yeah? What'd you think of it? \nKATE It was awful. I kept getting shushed. \nMR. DAVIES I don't normally tell people I work with this... but -- \nMr. Davies takes a COIN that says \"Nine Years\" out of his pocket and shows it to Kate. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) -- I'm a bit of an expert when it comes to these things. \nKATE (shocked) You? \nMR. DAVIES Yeah, me. I've lived a strange one.                    * I'm nine years sober, AA and NA. (beat) I used to drink cocaine. (off Kate's shocked expression) It's really cheap in the Philippines. \nMr. Davies takes a beat to think about what he's saying. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) Listen, Kate. I know meetings can be weird. Especially at first, but if you want to...you never need to feel like you have to...but the ones I go to are pretty small. Nice little groups. (beat) I'd be happy to take you. \nKATE Maybe that would be good...I don't know. \nMR. DAVIES No pressure, okay. That shit saved my life, though. \nPrincipal Barnes walks in. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) (switching gears) Well, I'm scheduled to observe Ms. Carol's art class. They're making macaroni art, so...I'm pretty stoked. \nMr. Davies gets up to leave -- discretely winking at Kate as he exits. \nPrincipal Barnes watches Mr. Davies leave, a puzzled expression on her face. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES (to Kate) Mrs. Hannah -- I've got something for you... \nPrincipal Barnes opens the MINI FRIDGE to reveal a huge jug of ORANGE JUICE. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D) Folic Acid! You need it now like never before. \nKATE (beat) Thanks. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES I bet your mother is over the moon, huh? Probably planning you a baby shower...? \nKATE Oh, well...she and I aren't that close. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES Oh, I'm sorry. Well, listen -- any motherly thing you need -- I'm                       * here, okay? \nBarnes hands Kate a large glass of juice. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D) Now drink up -- that baby in there's thirsty! \nKATE Okay. (takes a sip of orange juice) And...you're kinda the only person at school -- besides Mr. Davies -- who knows I'm pregnant. Could you...? \nPRINCIPAL BARNES My lips are -- \nPrincipal Barnes mimes \"zipping\" her lips. \n32   EXT./INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY \nKate walks in the front door to see    --                      * \n-- Charlie working on his computer. A BEER next to him. An old record PLAYS on the record player. \nKATE Hey... \nCHARLIE Howdy. \nKate collapses on the couch next to Charlie and kisses him. \nKATE How was your day? And what's that smell? \nCHARLIE Eh -- alright. Couldn't find oatmeal so I made ketchup soup. \nThe group CHUCKLES. \nJENNY (CONT'D)                           * And I found a love in cooking. I've                * got my own catering business now.                  * And...maybe I just replaced alcohol with chocolate chips and cigarettes, but still...it's been years since I woke up in a park -- in a different state. \nLAUGHTER. \nKate leans in towards Mr. Davies and whispers -- \nKATE I kinda like her. \nMR. DAVIES Sponsor potential? \nKate nods. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) Get her number at break. \nKATE I feel like you're my wingman. \nKate grins at Mr. Davies, who smiles shyly and glances away. \nLATER \nAn older man -- ARLO -- stands and announces. \nARLO                                    * Arlo, Alcoholic. There'll now be a ten minute break. Smoke em' if you got em. \nAs some of the PEOPLE go outside -- \n-- Kate walks over to Jenny, who's getting a cup of coffee.    * \nKATE Hey, I liked your speech. \nJENNY                                  * Thanks. All that dumb shit happened so I'm glad that now it's at least entertaining. (beat) What's your name? \nKATE Kate. This is my first meeting. Or... first meeting where I'm not wasted. \nJenny LAUGHS.                                                  * \nJENNY                                   * Oh, yeah -- I remember doing some of that. \nKATE I don't really know how this stuff works. (MORE) \nKATE (CONT'D) But...could I get your number? I mean, I may not need it, but... \nJENNY                                     * Yeah, of course. I can help explain it to you -- and also, we can just talk. \nKATE Okay. Yeah. (beat) You've been sober since you were \nJenny nods.                                                   * \nKATE (CONT'D) That seems really young. \nJENNY                                    * I didn't have much of a choice -- I crashed my car into a nursing home. (beat) I think the break is just about over. This meeting is the kind where everyone can share. Sharing always helps me, so...if it's not too weird -- try introducing yourself and telling the group what's going on. \nLATER \nEveryone is sitting down and sharing. The woman (TINA) next   * to Kate is finishing up. \nTINA                                      * ...anyway, that's where I'm at today. Thanks for listening. \nEveryone looks at Kate. \nKATE Okay, um...hello. I'm Kate and... (long beat) ...I'm an alcoholic? \nKate nervously LAUGHS. \nGROUP Hi, Kate. \nKATE Sorry. I don't mean to laugh -- it's just saying those words... (beat) ...I think I'm an alcoholic, but I don't really know. I drink -- a lot. I've always drank. Everyone I know drinks a lot. I never really thought I had a problem -- lately though it seems like maybe I do. I just want to be able to drink a beer without it turning into twenty -- or wetting my bed. (beat) It seems like every time I drink something awful happens. All the shit that I used to laugh off isn't really funny anymore. The dumb drunk stuff has gone from embarrassing to scary. (beat) I'm kinda...scared. \nKate stops. Looks around self-consciously. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: A SERIES OF short, quick scenes: \n43   EXT. JENNY'S CATERING BUSINESS - NIGHT                       43   * \nKate -- who eats a piece of CAKE -- sits on a patio with          * Jenny, Mr. Davies, and several other PEOPLE from AA.              * \nJENNY                                         * I'm really proud of you, Kate. \nKATE I kinda can't believe it's been ninety days. (beat) The longest I've gone since high school without drinking was, like, a week. \nMR. DAVIES My first three months were such hell. I think I'm only sober today because I just never want to go through that again. \nKATE It's weird -- in after-school specials the getting-sober part was only like a minute of the movie and suddenly...daddy's all okay. \nSeveral people LAUGH. \nKATE (CONT'D) But it's so fucking hard and weird and suddenly I have all these other problems now that drinking isn't the problem. \nJENNY                          * Like what?                                  * \nKATE Everything else. Work, my non- existent relationship with my mom... \nJENNY                             * When was the last time you saw her? \nKATE (tries to remember) A year, at least. \nJENNY                             * Well...maybe it's time. \nKATE Maybe. (beat) And then there's my marriage. I mean, Charlie's great. Really great, he's supportive, especially at first. It's strange, though. I feel like alcohol was the thing that connected us and now that I don't drink we lead these two very different lives. (beat) We haven't slept together in forever... (laughs) I haven't pissed myself in awhile, though. So that's good. \nJENNY                             * It takes time. \nKate gives an exasperated look. \nJENNY (CONT'D)                    * (half-stern cheerleader tone) Keep working the steps. (glances at her watch) Let's grab coffee tomorrow, okay? I should actually run you home now and come back. I need to start locking up. \nKATE I could stick around and help you... \nMR. DAVIES (to Kate) I could take you home. (off Kate's reaction) If you want. \n44   INT./EXT. MR. DAVIES' CAR - NIGHT                 44   * \nMr. Davies pulls up to Kate's house. \nMR. DAVIES My ex-wife -- she doesn't drink -- well, not like us, but as soon as I got sober I started to change and she just...didn't. \nKATE I didn't know you were married. \nBeat. \nMR. DAVIES Yeah, I was married once -- (laughs) -- in my other life. But I shouldn't be talking to you about this stuff. \nKATE Why? \nMR. DAVIES I don't know... \nKATE Because you're a dude we can't talk? I don't get that \"men stick with men, women stick with women\" stuff. \nMR. DAVIES Well, if you were sitting where I'm sitting you'd understand. \nKATE Are you trying to tell me that you have a crush on me? \nMR. DAVIES What am I, one of your students?            * Crush? \nKATE Yeah, crush. \nMR. DAVIES (long beat) I kind of do, yes. I have a crush on you. I know that's wrong -- you're newly sober and married and I shouldn't be thinking about you like that. But yeah, I should put that out on the table. (beat) Honesty. \nKATE It's okay. I think you're a really good guy. \nMR. DAVIES Oh, great -- good guys are the nerds that carry the pretty girls' books. \nKATE Oh, c'mon... \nMR. DAVIES I think you're beautiful. \nKate smiles bashfully. \nKATE (to Charlie; slightly annoyed) Drink if you want to, Charlie. (to Rochelle) Charlie didn't stop drinking. I'm doing it by myself. (beat) And...I started going to 12-step meetings. \nRochelle looks slightly disgusted. \nROCHELLE Ah...yes. Assholes Anonymous. (to Charlie) Katie's father went to those meetings a few years after we got married. Dried up. Left me. You can see how well that worked out for me... (Rochelle gestures to her living room) ...I raised his daughter in this PALACE while he's somewhere in Florida with his shiny new wife and kids. (beat) Bastard. (long beat; to Charlie) You better be careful -- they change. \nKate and Charlie exchange a glance. \nKATE I thought you'd be happy for me, mom. \nROCHELLE Oh...I'm sorry -- I'm not being a good hostess, am I? \nRochelle gets up, takes the drink away from Kate, and chugs it. \nROCHELLE (CONT'D) I'll microwave you your favorite. \nA FEW MOMENTS LATER \nCharlie, Kate, and Rochelle watch a REALITY TV SHOW -- while eating... \n...MCDONALDS CHEESEBURGERS.                                      * \nRochelle rests her head on Kate's shoulder. \nROCHELLE (CONT'D) I'm sorry if I acted like a bitch. \nKATE It's okay, mom. I know you can't help it. \n51   EXT. LAKE ARROWHEAD - SANTA'S VILLAGE - DAY                 51 \nKate and Charlie wander around Santa's Village -- \n-- an abandoned Christmas-themed amusement park (with giant ginger bread houses, plastic Christmas trees, etc.) in the middle of the woods. Creepy and nostalgic at the same time. Looks like the set of a Christmas horror film. \nKate holds Charlie's hand as she leads him around. \nKATE This place shut down a decade ago and then there was a fire and now it's basically abandoned. \nCharlie seems totally impressed by the weirdness of the place. \nKATE (CONT'D) We came here every year the week before Christmas. (MORE) \nKATE (CONT'D) And then I worked here in high school -- selling hot chocolate. And they had real reindeer, too. They kept `em over there. \nKate points at the remains of a PEN. \nKATE (CONT'D) My mom worked here when she was younger. I think everyone who grew                  * up around here worked at Santa's Village at some point. \nCharlie just nods and listens -- he's in awe of this place. \nKATE (CONT'D) This is what I think of when I think of Christmas. (long beat) Thanks for coming up here with me. \nCHARLIE Of course. \nKATE I'm sorry my mom's so awful. \nCHARLIE (shrugs) She just can't handle her liquor. \nKate and Charlie look in each other's eyes. Seem to have a moment. And then Charlie asks -- \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Did you ever hook up with guys when you worked here? \nKATE Huh? \nCHARLIE You know -- sneak off with a co- worker and do it against a pine tree or something? \nKATE Um...no. \nCHARLIE I mean, if I were a teenage boy working with a stone cold fox like you I'd totally want to hook up with you here. Like...in the ginger bread house. \nCharlie puts his arms around Kate. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) You were probably the coolest girl in town -- and the prettiest. I'm sure everyone was in love with you. \nKate giggles. They kiss. It's sweet. \nKATE No -- you don't have to do that. I didn't even tell him. But...you can't say that to a girl -- like, ever. \nMR. DAVIES Okay. \nKATE Seriously. Consider that a rule of thumb. (beat) Someday, you're gonna meet a nice, available lady -- but if you say \"moist pussy\" to her, you will never, ever, ever get to see that part of her body! \nMR. DAVIES (even more embarrassed) Okay. (beat) Thank you. (nods) I feel like this was a really good talk. \nKate forces a smile. \n55   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT             55 \nKate stares at a -- \n-- HALF-EATEN BIRTHDAY CAKE (\"OWEN\" is still sort of legible) on the kitchen table. It's totally mutilated. \nShe walks out the back door into the                            * \nBACKYARD                                                        * \nwhere she finds                                                 * \nCharlie, Owen, and one of Owen's friends --                     * \n-- GREG, 21 --                                                  * \n-- listening to loud MUSIC while they play FOOSBALL.            * \nThey're all SHIT-HOUSED.                                        * \nGREG                                       * ...getting married would fucking                     * suck.

Hey, Kate. \nKATE                                       * I see you guys found the birthday                    * cake Jenny and I baked.                              * \nOWEN                                       * Yeah, thanks!

KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT -     57   * MOMENTS LATER \nCharlie walks in to see Kate getting ready to go to bed.          * \nTOBY Mrs. Hannah -- are you going to hell? \nKATE No! I didn't kill my baby! Okay, listen kids -- we shouldn't be talking about this. But... (beat) ...sometimes women get pregnant and then early on -- before it's even a baby -- they stop being pregnant. \nWINNIE                               * Because a doctor murders it! \nKATE No -- not because a doctor   murdered it. (beat) It's called a miscarriage.   That means it wasn't my plan --   it's just what happened. (composes herself) Does anyone want to ask me   any questions? \nThe class nods but seems silently freaked out. \nKATE (CONT'D) Let's get back to subtraction -- or addition. Or both. \n59   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY        59 \nKate sits with Mr. Davies eating lunch. \nMR. DAVIES Well, that was bound to happen at some point. Kids notice things like that. \nKate nods. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) But I had no idea how pro-life little Winnie Reddy is.                        * (beat) Remind me to wear my \"May the fetus you save be gay\" T-shirt to the next banana split night. \nKate half-laughs. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) And just think: the kids got a lesson about life and death that nobody planned on. I mean, you're years ahead of the standard curriculum for, uh, third graders. \nKATE Does it matter that I lied? That I was never pregnant? \nMR. DAVIES You want me to answer that as a friend or as someone who takes the twelve steps very seriously? \nKate shrugs. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) Well, the good thing is that it's all over now. Principal Barnes will think you're a martyr for losing a baby. (beat) The kids won't ask about it anymore and as long as you don't toss your cookies again you won't have to deal with it. \nKATE (long beat) And the bad news? \nMR. DAVIES You lied. To your boss -- and a bunch of small children. Who trust you. And rely on you to help them differentiate right from wrong. \nKATE (slowly nods) That's all, huh? \n60   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/DINING          60   * ROOM/KITCHEN/BEDROOM - NIGHT                                   * \nKate and Charlie eat TAKE-OUT FOOD in SILENCE. Kate texts on her CELL PHONE -- not even paying attention to Charlie. \nCHARLIE Well... (beat) (MORE) \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) ...I gotta say -- this is the boringest meal I've had in about as long as I can remember. \nKate doesn't look up. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Who're you texting? \nKATE (still looking down) Jenny.                                      * \nCHARLIE She's like a parole officer. \nKATE She's my sponsor. \nCHARLIE I'm glad to know every little fuck- up I have is gonna become a topic of conversation with some chick I don't even know. \nKate finishes her text. Puts down her phone. \nKATE (fake enthusiasm) So...what'd you do today, honey? \nCHARLIE I finished some writing and met up with Owen to watch the game and toss a few back. Dear. (beat) You do anything special? \nKATE I lied to my class again. I told them that I had a miscarriage. \nCharlie LAUGHS. \nKATE (CONT'D) That's not funny. \nCHARLIE Yeah, it is. Telling kids fucked-up stuff is totally funny...in, you know -- a kinda fucked-up way. \nKATE Great, well -- I'm glad I'm not actually having a baby. \nJENNY                             * Yeah, steps -- and talking and listening and crying... \nKATE I have the crying part covered. \nJENNY                            * I know, right? I think my first year I cried tears I'd been saving since I was eight. (beat) It's hard to live your life...honestly. You know? \nKate nods. \nJENNY (CONT'D)                   * Any idea what you're gonna do about your school situation? What you're gonna say? \nKate shakes her head. \nKATE I don't know what I'm gonna do about anything. \nJENNY                                         * Listen...you wanna stay in my guest                     * room tonight? You can watch movies, get some good sleep...? \nKATE You sure that's okay? \nJENNY                                        * Yeah, of course. That's why I spent money on a guest bed -- so people could sleep in it. (beat) I know it might feel like it, but really, you don't have to figure everything out tonight. (smiles) You've got time. \n62   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                     62 \nKate goes into her classroom and finds a NOTE on the desk. \n63   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY            63 \nPrincipal Barnes hugs Kate. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES I'm so sorry, Kate. (beat) I haven't told many people this, but when I was young -- younger than you...I lost a child too. \nKate's stunned. Looks like she feels terrible. \nKATE I'm...I'm really sorry. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES It's okay. It was a long, long time ago. Still hurts sometimes. But eventually...you move on. You have to. (beat) Have a seat. \nKate sits down. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D) I got a phone call from a very upset parent. That's how I found out about...you know. Frankly, I'm not sure why you didn't feel like you could tell me. \nKATE I freaked out -- a student asked why I wasn't fat and I just froze up and then another student was saying I killed my baby and I didn't know what to do. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES I'm not angry with you -- but I need to be clear that this doesn't happen again. \nKATE It won't. I promise that. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES By \"not happening again,\" I mean that you don't discuss any controversial topics -- things the school board deems \"family matters\" with your class. (beat) No sex. No god. No drugs and alcohol. \nKATE Okay, I... \nKate straightens up in her seat, takes a deep breath. She seems...exhausted. \nKATE (CONT'D) ...I can't keep doing this. I feel awful. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES (confused) I know this all must be hard for you -- \nKATE No. You don't understand. (beat) I have to be honest with you. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES What do you mean? \nKATE Principal Barnes...I wasn't ever pregnant. \nPrincipal Barnes looks shocked. \nKATE (CONT'D) I lied -- to the class and to you -- because I was scared. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES But...you vomited in class. \nKATE I know. And when that happened I didn't know what to do because the truth is -- \nPRINCIPAL BARNES Oh, my god -- are you really ill? Is it cancer? \nKATE No, well, yes. I have a disease, but, um... (beat) ...it's alcoholism. \nPrincipal Barnes goes from concerned -- to angry. \nMr. Davies awkwardly puts his arm around Kate's shoulder. \nMR. DAVIES I'm sorry. I wish there was something I could do. \nKATE I'm a fuck-up. I'll always be a fuck up. I'm just like my mom. \nMR. DAVIES (confused) No, no -- you're a wonderful, smart woman Kate. You can't let this get you down. \nKATE I gotta go. \nMr. Davies takes Kate's box of things from her. \nMR. DAVIES Let me walk you to your car. \nKate throws her arms around Mr. Davies and begins to -- \n-- full-on SOB. \nMr. Davies seems flustered and a little scared but tries to comfort Kate. \n65   INT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAY                                   65 \nKate cries as she drives. \nShe glances in the backseat at -- \n-- all the baby shower gifts -- \n-- and sobs even harder. \n66   INT. DIVE BAR - DAY                                          66 \nKate walks into a near-empty, depressing dive. She nervously sits at the bar. \nThe BARTENDER -- a gruff looking guy with the sleeves rolled      * up -- approaches. \nBARTENDER What do you need? \nKATE Whiskey. Double. \nThe bartender gives Kate her drink. Kate immediately downs it. \nKATE (CONT'D) Can I have another one? \nBARTENDER Sure -- you gotta pay for the first one, though. Eight bucks. \nKate puts a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL down. \nThe bartender pours her another shot. \nLATER \nKate has clearly been drinking for awhile -- she's curled up at the bar, nursing her BEER. \nBARTENDER (CONT'D) Look, Miss -- I don't wanna be a downer or anything `cause I take it you've had a bad day, but um... I think you need to go home. \nKATE Why? \nBARTENDER Cause you're pretty drunk -- and it's four p.m. \nKATE What about him? \nKate points to an old CRUSTY MAN at the other end of the bar. \nKATE (CONT'D) You're not kicking him out. \nBARTENDER I'm just trying to be a pal. \nKATE Stop it -- you aren't my pal. I just got fired, and I just quit AA. (beat) It didn't work. \nBARTENDER Oh, boy... \nKATE You know what? I was fine -- had a husband that loved me and maybe I sometimes did embarrassing stuff, but it was a phase. (MORE) \nKATE (CONT'D) I go to AA and sober my husband and I start fighting and stop fucking -- and sober I get fired! Isn't that what's supposed to not happen? \n-- Kate stumbles to her front door. \nJENNY                                     * Kate! Are you sure you're -- \nKATE (over her shoulder) Fuck off. \n69   INT.

It's insane. \nKate says nothing. Just stares at Charlie. \nCharlie looks up -- and is surprised to see Kate clearly drunk. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Whoa...what happened to you? \nCharlie stops playing the game. \nKATE I'm drunk. I'm fired from my job. \nCHARLIE Oh, no... \nKATE We got any drinks? \nCHARLIE Uh...we have soda. I can make coffee. \nKATE Don't be cute with me. You know what I mean. \nCHARLIE So...I guess you aren't doing the AA thing anymore? \nKATE What gave that away? \nKate turns and goes to the kitchen -- \n-- reappearing a moment later with a BOTTLE OF TEQUILA, salt and limes. \nKATE (CONT'D) Come on, baby -- let's do some shots. \nCHARLIE What's going on? \nKATE I'm celebrating. What the fuck does it look like? \nKate takes a shot. \nKATE (CONT'D) Are you gonna be a little girl or are you gonna drink with me? \nCHARLIE I don't know what the right thing to do here is. \nKATE Okay, so let me see if this makes sense: you say you miss the old Kate -- the Kate who drinks and blacks out and has fun. (beat) Well...here she is. \nKate smiles -- but she looks more desperate and drunk than fun. \nCHARLIE Baby, I didn't mean that. I was just being a jerk. \nKATE Fuck yeah you were. And what? Now you won't drink with me? \nCHARLIE I don't know. Having a beer or something is one thing, but...I think you really may have a problem. \nKate LAUGHS. \nKATE Well thanks for all the support when I was trying to be sober! \nKate takes another shot. \nCHARLIE I'm sorry. I didn't realize -- \nKATE Of course you didn't realize! You don't fucking care about me. \nCHARLIE What are you talking about?! Of course I care about you. I love you. \nKate takes a shot and approaches Charlie. \nKATE (proud) Thanks. \n71   INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                          71 \nA middle-aged MAN stands at a podium in front of a medium sized group of PEOPLE -- about twenty-five or so, including Kate, Jenny, and Mr. Davies -- and says --                          * \nCHUCK                                          * At this meeting we give cakes to celebrate sober birthdays. We have one birthday tonight -- for Kate, for one year. (beat) Jenny and Dave are giving her the                         * cake. \nKate hugs everyone -- then blows out ONE CANDLE on a CAKE before standing at the podium. \nKATE Hey, I'm Kate, alcoholic. \nGROUP Hi, Kate. \nKATE I've heard that your best day drinking is worse than your worst day sober. (beat) Well...that is SO not true! I had amazing times drinking, dancing, and laughing...feeling like the most adorable, charming girl in the world. And I was adorable. (beat) I'd piss my pants, but I was still cute. \nPeople in the crowd LAUGH a little bit. \nKATE (CONT'D) When I first tried getting sober, I figured that as long as I didn't drink...everything else would just magically work out. But it didn't. (beat) My marriage fell apart. I got fired from my job. And that shit happened SOBER! I never read that in any pamphlet... (shakes her head) ...that isn't what I signed up for. (beat) Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty slogan I've heard in the rooms is that when you're sober for a bit and drink again \"the disease waits for you, picks up where it left off.\" (beat) I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE those slogans. They all sound like bumper stickers. But, I have to admit...for me, that last one is pretty damn true. (beat) When I drink...I become another person. And that person is a pretty big asshole. Well, unless you want to give me drugs or buy me drinks -- then that person is awesome. \nPeople knowingly LAUGH. \nKATE (CONT'D) I wasn't happy being the \"good-time girl,\" though. And honestly, I wasn't very good at it. (MORE) \nKATE (CONT'D) (beat) My life is really different than it was a year ago. I live alone. I'm bored a lot more. I have a job that pays a lot less. (beat) I'm thankful for the program -- for my friends in here who took the time to help me and give a shit about me. \nKate glances at Jenny and Mr. Davies.                             * \nKATE (CONT'D) There are people that used to be a part of my life that I miss -- a lot -- but... (long beat) ...I'm really grateful for this boring new life of mine. \nKate smiles and steps down from the podium as people CLAP. \n72   INT.

Owen speaks -- but Millie seems way more into Charlie. \nOWEN I was in North Carolina for a while                     * -- Durham -- playing minor league ball. I had some real heat. That's when I met Crash, here. (gestures to Charlie) He'd been sent down to single-A to teach me how to carry myself as a pro ball-player. We got involved with the same woman -- an older chick -- but Crash won her in the end. (beat) He's really taught me some...important life-lessons. \nMillie nods. \nMILLIE Wow...that's a pretty crazy way to meet. \nOWEN Yeah. It is. \nMILLIE You guys are sorta like that movie...what's it called? \nOWEN (plays dumb) I don't know. Which one? (to Charlie) Do you know what movie she means? \nCharlie -- who's pretty hammered -- shakes his head. \nMILLIE \"Bull\"...something? What is it? \nCharlie and Owen feign ignorance. \nMILLIE (CONT'D) Whatever. It'll come to me. (to Charlie; flirty) So...what do you do now, Crash? \nCHARLIE I write about music. \nMILLIE Really? \nOwen gestures to a WAITRESS to bring THREE MORE SHOTS. \nCHARLIE Yeah...I do freelance for a lot of magazines. But print really is dead. So now most of my stuff winds up on websites. Which is depressing. `Cause you can't hold it -- you can just look at it. It's like... \nCharlie seems lost in drunken thought. Long, awkward silence. Millie puts her hand on Charlie's arm. \nMILLIE Like what? \nCHARLIE Huh? \nMILLIE You were talking about writing for websites and you kinda trailed off, honey. \nOWEN (trying to save the situation) So, Crash -- why don't you tell this nice lady about the 21 days you were up in \"The Show,\" and what the crowds were like, and -- \nCHARLIE It was crazy. I... \nKATE No. \nCharlie seems relieved. \nCHARLIE Me either. Owen keeps trying to get me to be his \"wing-man\" and it's ridiculous and these girls in bars are so lame and I just keep thinking how I wish I was meeting you in a bar for the first time and I didn't come with any baggage and I could buy you a drink and flirt with you all night and ask for your number. (beat) Wanna go out sometime? \nKATE I don't think it's a good idea. \nCharlie nods. Long beat. \nCHARLIE I fucked up, didn't I? \nKate looks down, doesn't speak. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Yeah, I did. I know I did. I had a beautiful woman who used to love me and now when I see her she doesn't even want to look me in the eyes. \nKATE Charlie, please don't do this. \nCHARLIE I miss you. I miss the way you taste and smell and...I miss things about you that used to drive me nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's music and fake punk-rock from the 90's... \nKATE I don't like shitty 80's music. (beat) I like good 80's music. \nCHARLIE ...and all I want to do is touch you one more time to just, remember -- to make sure it was real. \nSilence. Kate looks Charlie in the eyes and gives him a slight smile. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) (changing course) Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional fucking idiot. \n76   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY      76   * \nKate and Charlie walk in -- it looks sort of the same, but a number of items are missing, and it's messier. In general, the room looks more \"dude.\" \nKATE You look really thin. \nCHARLIE Yeah? \nKATE When did you last eat? \nCHARLIE I dunno -- like...I'm not sure. (seems slightly concerned                           * that he can't remember) I think, um... \nKATE Should we order something? \nCHARLIE Sure, yeah -- or I could make a bacon and egg sandwich... \nKATE I don't know. I haven't really been doing the meat thing. \nCHARLIE Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then meat. (beat) Have you given up fun, too? \nKate looks at Charlie -- he's half-smiling, not sure if she finds him funny. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) (off Kate) Sorry. Bad joke. \nKate cracks a smile. \nKATE Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But I'm gonna make them. \nCharlie raises his eyebrows. \nCHARLIE Okay... \nLATER \nKate's at the stove, cooking bacon and eggs. \nCharlie goes to the FRIDGE and gets a BOTTLE OF BEER. \nKate glances at him. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Sorry. \nCharlie puts the beer back in the fridge. \nKATE I don't care if you drink a beer. \nCHARLIE You sure? \n", "test1_input": "SMASHED \nWritten by \nJames Ponsoldt & Susan Burke \nSeptember 24th, 2011 \nOVER BLACK: \nCLINKING GLASSES and other assorted BAR SOUNDS. \nKARAOKE ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

She stands on a tiny \nKARAOKE STAGE \nin the far corner of a half-empty dive bar. \nKate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke version of \"SONG TO BE DETERMINED.\" What Kate lacks in talent she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm. \nAt a table near the stage is -- \n-- CHARLIE HANNAH: Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but      * handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with -- \n-- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlie's younger brother, early-20's --       * who sings along with -- \n-- the small but energetic CROWD. \nKate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points to Charlie and Owen. For the moment, this drunk girl is the Queen of Karaoke. \nLATER \nKate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to join Charlie and Owen. \nCHARLIE That was so good, baby! \nKATE Bullshit. \nCHARLIE I'm serious. You sing like an angel -- a drunk angel. \nOwen and Kate LAUGH. \nKATE If you were writing about my performance for your blog, what would you say? \nCHARLIE I'd say that, uh...my wife is the sexiest, most amazing woman alive. \nKATE That would be such a shitty article -- nobody would read it. \nKate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at Owen and makes a puppy dog face. \nKATE (CONT'D) (to Owen) Aw...we need to find you a lady, Owen. \nOWEN Yeah -- I've been trying to flirt with the bartender, but...I can't tell. \nOwen motions to the -- \n-- FEMALE BARTENDER, early 20's.                                * \nKATE She's hot!

Charlie and Owen follow. Kate puts her arms around Owen and gets the attention of the bartender. \nKATE (CONT'D) I want to buy a gimlet for me and a double-shot of whiskey for my brother-in-law `cause he's had a hard week. \nFEMALE BARTENDER `Kay. \nThe bartender quickly pours the drinks. \nFEMALE BARTENDER (CONT'D) That's fifteen. \nKATE Wait -- don't you wanna know what happened to him? \nThe bartender rolls her eyes and checks around the bar to see if there are other customers. It's pretty dead -- so she listens. \nFEMALE BARTENDER (unenthused) What happened? \nKATE He just got back from England -- because he went there for a girl! A preppy, bitchy girl. Diane Court...that was her name. He loved her so much that he went with her because she had a fellowship or something. He gave up being a kickboxer. A kickboxer!                               * (sad) And she dumped him. \nThe bartender sizes up Owen. The trio waits with anticipation to hear her response, which is -- \nFEMALE BARTENDER (to Owen) You kickbox? \nOWEN (caught in the headlights) Yeah. \nAnd...that's all Owen's got. \nKATE (jumping in) And he teaches kids at the kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so cute! \nThe bartender glances back to Owen. \nOWEN (finally) A lot of `em don't have parents -- so...it's kinda more than just a teacher/student thing. (beat) I know it sounds silly, but I feel responsible for them -- like... (emotional) ...I could be their parent. \nKate slides down the bar to Charlie. \nKATE (hushed) I think I got him laid. \nCHARLIE Yeah? \nKATE She seems totally game. \nCHARLIE Sure she just didn't want to get into your pants? \nKate rolls her eyes. \nKATE I think I'm done for the night. \nCHARLIE Yeah? \nOwen wanders over, dejected.                         * \nOWEN She's seen \"Say Anything.\" \nCHARLIE Eh, well...what're you gonna do, huh?

Not having to report to an office only makes work harder. (to Kate) Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen should take us home -- you're too drunk to drive. \nKATE So's Owen. (suddenly focused) I'm not that drunk. Besides, you know I focus when I drive -- it sobers me up. \nCHARLIE Tell that to the cops. \nKate kisses Charlie and hugs Owen. \n", "test1_id": 3198, "test2_input": "KATE Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed -- but I feel a lot better.

That's...not good. \nKATE I know. I...please don't say anything. \nMr. Davies looks torn, unsure how to respond. \nMR. DAVIES Just...go home.

I spent like three hours at the post office trying to buy stamps and stuff. \nKate takes a long sip of beer. \nKATE I told my class I was pregnant. \nCharlie looks up at Kate with a beaming smile. He leans over and grabs her hand. \nCHARLIE (excited and sort of confused) Oh, baby, that's -- \nKATE I'm not. Pregnant. So don't worry. \nCHARLIE (deflated) Oh. (beat) `Cause it would be great news -- if it was true. (beat) `Course then I'd have to drink your beer... \nKATE Well, it was a lie. I just lied to my class.

(hushed) ...smoked some crack. \nCHARLIE WHAT?! \nSome bar patrons glance at Kate and Charlie. \nKATE After I left the bar, I, uh, picked up this drunk girl and...I don't really remember what came next, but I ended up smoking crack with her. \nCHARLIE (confused) Uh...how's that even happen? (beat) You give someone a ride and she rewards you with crack?! \nKATE Well...she seemed desperate. She really needed a ride home. \nCHARLIE Where? \nKATE Downtown. I think she maybe lives in...a tent? \nCHARLIE What? \nKATE Well...she might be homeless. Or a prostitute. Or just some lost sorority girl. (thinks about it) To be honest, I'm not sure... \nCHARLIE (disgusted) Oh, my god...you smoked crack with some random stranger? Did you...share a pipe? \nKate doesn't answer. She doesn't need to. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Ughhh... (beat) Just playing Devil's advocate, but maybe it's the crack-smoking you need help with and not the drinking. \nKate gives Charlie a dirty look. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) I'm just saying. \nKATE The drinking led to the crack- smoking. The drinking leads to everything stupid I do. (beat) I mean...can you even remember the last time we had sober sex? \nCharlie begins to answer, but then...goes blank. He tries to remember. And can't. \nCHARLIE We'll chill out with the booze for a while. We can just be wine-with-                   * dinner people. (beat) How's that sound? \n19   EXT.

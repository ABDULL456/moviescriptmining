Let's give a hand to Rodney! \nScattered APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER. \nKARAOKE ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Next up, we've got a little lady named...KATE! \nJoyful APPLAUSE. \nBAR VOICES (V.O.) Yeah, Kate! \nTHE OPENING MUZAK STRAINS OF A \"KARAOKE SONG TO BE DETERMINED\" \nFADE IN: \n1   INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT                                     1 \nCLOSE ON: KATE HANNAH -- late-20s, pretty and wholesome and,     * oh yeah, piss drunk. She stands on a tiny \nKARAOKE STAGE \nin the far corner of a half-empty dive bar. \nKate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke version of \"SONG TO BE DETERMINED.\" What Kate lacks in talent she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm. \nAt a table near the stage is -- \n-- CHARLIE HANNAH: Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but      * handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with -- \n-- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlie's younger brother, early-20's --       * who sings along with -- \n-- the small but energetic CROWD. \nKate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points to Charlie and Owen. For the moment, this drunk girl is the Queen of Karaoke. \nLATER \nKate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to join Charlie and Owen. \nCHARLIE That was so good, baby! \nKATE Bullshit. \nCHARLIE I'm serious. You sing like an angel -- a drunk angel. \nOwen and Kate LAUGH. \nKATE If you were writing about my performance for your blog, what would you say? \nCHARLIE I'd say that, uh...my wife is the sexiest, most amazing woman alive. \nKATE That would be such a shitty article -- nobody would read it. \nKate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at Owen and makes a puppy dog face. \nKATE (CONT'D) (to Owen) Aw...we need to find you a lady, Owen. \nOWEN Yeah -- I've been trying to flirt with the bartender, but...I can't tell. \nOwen motions to the -- \n-- FEMALE BARTENDER, early 20's.                                * \nKATE She's hot! What can't you tell? \nKATE (to Charlie) I love you, baby. I'll be waiting for you in a nice warm bed. You have exactly one mission: get your brother laid -- and don't talk to any other women. \nBeat. \nCHARLIE That sounds like two missions. \nKATE No, it's just one. \nCHARLIE (to Owen) It kinda sounded like two, right? \nOWEN (nodding) It did. \nKate grins and slowly backs away towards the door. \nKATE (really fast) GoodbyeIloveyouboth! \n2   EXT. KARAOKE BAR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT                        2   * \nKate stumbles out of the bar and hears a GROAN. She glances over and sees: \nA drunk woman -- FREDA, 30s -- sitting on the curb. She MOANS again. \nKate glances around the parking lot. Nobody else but her and Freda. \nKATE You okay? \nFREDA (quick) Yeah. Are you? \nKATE (taken aback) Um...sure. \nFREDA Good. (whispers) Hey, I'm not really okay. \nKATE Oh... \nFREDA My bitch sister just took off and left me here so she could hook up with some asshole. Now what am I supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a car here. \nKATE I guess I could... \nFREDA You'll give me a ride? Oh my god! Thank you! \nFreda gets up quickly -- and almost falls over.                   * \nKATE I was gonna say \"call you a cab,\" `cause, you know -- I don't even know you. \nFREDA It's not far. Please? Pretty please...? \nKate looks dismayed. Not sure what to do. \nCUT TO: \n3   INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - NIGHT                             3   * \nThe car passes through Chinatown on its way downtown.             * \nKate drives with Freda in the passenger seat. Freda glances down at the floor and notices a FLASK.                            * \nFREDA You know, you shouldn't drink and drive. \nKATE I wasn't -- \nFREDA Just kidding. Can I have a sip? \nKate's speechless. \nFREDA (CONT'D) I'm really thirsty. \nKATE It's, uh...whiskey. \nFREDA Fuck yeah, it's whiskey! I love whiskey. You're the real thing, huh? A hardcore drinking bitch like me! \nFreda takes a swig from Kate's flask. \nKATE I don't know. No. \nFREDA Can I smoke in your car? \n5    EXT. DOWNTOWN - SIDEWALK - DAWN                               5 \nKate is asleep on the curb. She looks awful. Suddenly, Kate's eyes widen. She looks around at her surroundings, confused, then jumps to her feet. \n6    EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREETS - DAWN                                6 \nKate runs through the streets. \n6A   EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREETS - DAWN                               6A   * \nWe TRACK along with Kate as she dashes past various               * buildings.                                                        * \n6B   EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREET - DAWN                                6B   * \nWe stare down a long, empty street, the downtown SKYSCRAPERS      * towering in the distance. From out of nowhere --                  * \n-- Kate appears at the end of the street and sprints towards      * the camera.                                                       * \nA LEGEND APPEARS OVER THE IMAGE OF KATE RUNNING: \n\"SMASHED\" \n7    INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAWN                              7 \nKate drives -- a paranoid expression on her face and her hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. She glances down at -- \n-- her CELL PHONE in the passenger seat. 21 missed calls. \nShe passes various sites on her way from downtown to Highland     * Park.                                                             * \n8   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - MORNING                         8 \nKate slowly pulls into the driveway of a small, cute house. \n9   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY/KITCHEN - 9     * MORNING \nKate walks into the kitchen to find -- \n-- Charlie asleep at the kitchen table. CELL PHONE next to his head. Empty BEER BOTTLES litter the table. \nKate tip-toes across the kitchen. \nCharlie quickly jerks up. \nCHARLIE (confused) Huh?! \nKATE Shhh...it's okay, baby. Go back to sleep. \nCHARLIE What happened? I came home and you were gone and I waited and waited. \nKATE It's a long story. \nCHARLIE I was worried. I kept calling you. \nKATE I ended up... \nCharlie SNIFFS Kate. \nCHARLIE You smell funny. What do you smell like? \nKATE I fell asleep in my car. Near the bar. I was too drunk to drive. \nCHARLIE So, why didn't you come back or call me? \nKATE Charlie -- (beat) -- I'm fine. \nCHARLIE Well, maybe I'm not. I worry, baby. I love you -- and you know how you get sometimes. \nKATE I love you too. But I'm home. It's over. I gotta get to work. \nCHARLIE I can't be worried about you all the time. \nKate rubs Charlie's hair and kisses his forehead. \nKATE Don't worry so much. I'm fine. (beat) C'mon -- let me get you to bed. \nHillary shuffles up to the board and writes \"CAN.\"              * \nKATE (CONT'D) Great job, Hillary -- let's give                      * her a round of applause! \nThe class APPLAUDS. \nHillary smiles and goes back to her seat.                       * \nKATE (CONT'D) Can anyone use \"can\" in a sentence? \nA student -- ANGELA -- raises her hand. \nKATE (CONT'D) Yes? \nANGELA \"Hurry up in there -- I gotta use the can!\" \nThe students GIGGLE. \nKATE (quickly moving on) Wonderful, Angela. You get a Camaro with flames painted on the hood. \nThe students CHEER. \nKATE (CONT'D) Now -- (to the class) -- what's another word I could make by adding a letter to \"an\"? \nNobody raises their hand. \nKATE (CONT'D) C'mon... \nFinally, a student in the back -- RAMON -- raises his hand. \nKATE (CONT'D) Yes -- Ramon? \nRAMON P. \nKATE P...okay, what word would that make if I added a \"P\"? \nRAMON Um...pan? \nKATE Pan! That's right. Ramon Martinez...COME ON DOWN! \nRamon walks up and begins to write \"PAN.\" \nKATE (CONT'D) Wow! Just look at that excellent penman -- \nKate stops suddenly and raises her hand to her mouth. She quickly runs behind her desk, leans over, and discretely -- \n-- VOMITS on the floor! \nRamon -- who's just inches from the pool of vomit -- looks horrified. \nKate glances up from behind her desk to see -- \n-- the kids all make grossed-out faces and say things like -- \nKIDS EW! GRODY! GROSS! YUCK! IT SMELLS LIKE CHEESE! SLOPPY JOE! GRANDPA! SHRIMP! BACON! \nEmbarrassed, Kate quickly gets TISSUES from her desk and begins cleaning up the mess. \nKATE (to the class) I'm so sorry you had to see that. \nHILLARY stands up.                                                * \nHILLARY                                       * Mrs. Hannah -- are you pregnant? \nKATE What? \nHILLARY                                       * My mommy threw up when she was pregnant with my little sister. Are you pregnant? \nSome of the kids begin WHISPERING (saying things like \"Ooh!\" \"She's gonna have a baby.\"). \nRAMON Are you? \nKate seems flustered and says -- \nKATE Yes. \nKATE Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed -- but I feel a lot better. And I just wanted to say thank you. \nMr. Davies glances down the hall. \nMR. DAVIES Look -- I'm not a fool. (whispered) I know you were drinking this morning. \nKate looks shocked. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) I saw you. \nKATE (taken aback) Oh, no, I... \nMR. DAVIES Drinking when you're pregnant is really dangerous. \nKATE I know that! Oh, God, I... (long beat) ...listen -- I'm not actually pregnant. \nMR. DAVIES What? \nKATE I'm just really hung over. The kids started asking me questions after I vomited and I panicked. \nMR. DAVIES Oh. That's...not good. \nKATE I know. I...please don't say anything. \nMr. Davies looks torn, unsure how to respond. \nMR. DAVIES Just...go home. Get some sleep. \nBefore Kate can say a word, Mr. Davies heads back into the classroom. \n17   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY                      17 \nKate has her face fully in the sink while water runs over it and -- \n-- TWO LITTLE GIRLS curiously watch. \n18   INT. NEIGHBORHOOD BAR - DAY                                  18   * \nKate and Charlie play POOL while splitting a PITCHER OF BEER. It's a bit early to be drinking, but hey -- why not? \nKATE I had such a crappy morning. \nCHARLIE Me too. I spent like three hours at the post office trying to buy stamps and stuff. \nKate takes a long sip of beer. \nKATE I told my class I was pregnant. \nCharlie looks up at Kate with a beaming smile. He leans over and grabs her hand. \nCHARLIE (excited and sort of confused) Oh, baby, that's -- \nKATE I'm not. Pregnant. So don't worry. \nCHARLIE (deflated) Oh. (beat) `Cause it would be great news -- if it was true. (beat) `Course then I'd have to drink your beer... \nKATE Well, it was a lie. I just lied to my class. After barfing in front of them. \nCHARLIE (cringes) Ooh... \nKATE Yeah, that's what they said. (long beat) Listen...I can't do this anymore. \nA look of complete terror and confusion passes over Charlie's face. \nCHARLIE What do you mean? \nKATE I dunno. I think I might...drink too much. \nCharlie LAUGHS. \nCHARLIE Oh. That. Yeah...you kinda do. \nCharlie swigs his beer. \nKATE I know I do -- I'm a fucking mess... \nKATE Yeah, right. \nCHARLIE Remember when I was shit-faced and took that Q & A pamphlet from there? \nKATE (laughs) Holy shit! And we answered \"yes\" to like every question and at the end it was like, \"If you answered `yes' to any of these you're an alcoholic!\" \nCHARLIE Yeah... (nostalgic) ...that was fun, wasn't it? \nKate smiles and nods. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Hey -- \nCharlie gestures to the street. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) -- look out for that crack! \nKate looks down but sees nothing. \nKATE What crack? \nCHARLIE Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a crack there... (grins) ...but you must have smoked it last night. \nKate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away. Kate chases after him. \n20   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER           20 \nWhile an old 70's R & B song plays on a RECORD PLAYER, which is next to STACKS AND STACKS OF RECORDS -- \n-- Kate and Charlie drunkenly slow dance, drink WINE, and        * LAUGH at an AA PAMPHLET. \nCHARLIE \"Have you missed days of work or school because of drinking?\" \nKATE Absolutely. \nCHARLIE \"Do you envy people who can drink without getting into trouble?\" \nKATE Envy isn't exactly the right word... \nCHARLIE \"Do you have `blackouts'?\" \nKATE Yeah, but who doesn't? \nCHARLIE \"Has your drinking caused trouble at home?\" \nKATE No! We're great. \nCHARLIE Yeah. Definitely. But we still had a lot of \"yes\" answers. (refers to pamphlet) Yep...we still qualify as drunks. \nKATE I'm gonna go! \nCHARLIE (disbelief) Yeah, right. \nKATE No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go. What time is it? \nCHARLIE Eight. \nKate gets up. \nKATE See ya. \nCHARLIE (doesn't believe her) Uh-huh... \nKate takes a big sip of wine. \nKATE (quite serious) This is me: going. \nCharlie LAUGHS -- he doesn't buy it. \nCHARLIE You've been boozing. \nKATE So? You should come too! \nCharlie LAUGHS. \nCHARLIE Yeah, right. You can't go to AA wasted. It's like a rule or something. \nKATE (not picking up the hint) I like drinking is the thing. I mean, I don't want to say you guys are wrong or anything... \nKate nervously LAUGHS. \nSome of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate. \nTATTOO MAN Thank you -- we're all here to help. We do have to move on, though. \nThe woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down. \nLILY                                      * Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be plenty of time to tell your story. \nA young woman -- AMBER, 22 -- approaches the podium. \nAMBER Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't really believe that it's been five years. I mean, my life was a mess back then. Now I'm back in school, I have an amazing man, I love my parents -- it's crazy... \nKATE (way too loud) How old is that girl?! Can she even go to bars? (to Amber) How old are you, Amber? \nSHANA                                      * Be respectful. \nKate seems surprised at being chastised. \nAMBER (gaining intensity) Um...okay? It's because I did the work. I got down on my knees and prayed every night! I went to a meeting everyday! \nKATE Everyday? \nAMBER It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say, I owe everything to AA. Well, AA -- and God, of course! \nThe whole room APPLAUDS. \nLATER \nEveryone is standing, holding hands, and saying the SERENITY PRAYER. \nEVERYONE God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change -- courage to change the things I can - - and wisdom to know the difference. \nKATE AMEN! \nEveryone turns and looks at Kate. \nKATE (CONT'D) (embarrassed) Okay...I think I'm good. \nKate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived. \n22   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT               22 \nKate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER. \nKATE So much for that. \nKate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss- crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN FURNITURE. \nThey drunkenly play CROQUET.                                      * \nCHARLIE Was it a bunch of old biker guys? \nKATE No, it was...I don't know. Enthusiastic people. A lot of really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE! \nCHARLIE Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm sorry it wasn't cool. \nCharlie thinks for a moment. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) I can't really imagine never drinking. I guess I don't have to, though -- (beat) -- you're the one with the problem. \nKate nods in agreement.                                           * \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Hey -- I love you. I don't want you to have to drink. \nKATE I don't have to drink. (beat) I just really like to drink.                            * \nCHARLIE (sincere) Good -- `cause you're my favorite person to drink with in the whole damn world. \nCharlie leans in to kiss Kate. They make out for a moment, and then Kate... \n...BITES Charlie's lip. Charlie pulls back, shocked. Kate grins mischievously. \nCLERK Look -- why don't you get a bottle of water or a coffee or something instead? \nKATE Water or coffee? Fuck you. What -- just cause I won't suck your dick? \nCLERK (had enough) Oh my god. Okay, enough -- you gotta go. \nKate doesn't budge. \nCLERK (CONT'D) Seriously, Kate. You should go. \nKATE Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! \nKate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with tears. \nKATE (CONT'D) This is bullshit! (beat) I have to pee. \nKate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door - - but it's locked. She hides from view, and then squats down and begins to pull up her robe. \nCLERK What the fuck are you doing?! \nKATE (caught) I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just have to pee really, really bad.                         * \nCLERK (frustrated) Get outta here NOW! \nKATE (pleads) C'mon...can't we drink together? \nThe clerk clearly isn't going to budge. Kate nods, resigned, and then... \n...grabs a BOTTLE OF WINE and dashes out the door. \n27   EXT. L.A. RIVER - DAWN                                       27 \nKate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles River. The empty bottle of (screw top) wine is next to her. \nKate's bicycle lays in some weeds nearby. \nA bird SQUAWKS. \nKate slowly wakes up, confused, and in a zombie-like state she gets up and trudges home, wheeling along her bike. \n28   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING              28 \nKate is awakened by the deafeningly loud ALARM CLOCK and the sound of a news radio ANNOUNCER. She looks at the clock and realizes that -- \n-- it's 7:30. \nShe jumps out of bed in a panic. \nKATE Charlie! \nKate pauses when she realizes her back is wet. She looks down at the bed, which is -- \n-- COMPLETELY SOAKED. \nKATE (CONT'D) (mumbled) Not again. \nHalf-asleep, Charlie rolls over onto the pee-soaked part of the bed. \nCHARLIE Come back to bed, baby. \nKATE I have to go to work. You snoozed my alarm again. I'm gonna be late. \nCHARLIE Well, you peed on me so I guess                     * we're even.                                         * \nKATE I have a weak bladder. \nCHARLIE Well...I can't go to work like this. \nKATE You work from our kitchen. \nCHARLIE Yeah, but changing the sheets is my real job. (beat) Hey -- where were you last night? \nKATE Huh? \nCHARLIE I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you were gone. \nThe group CHUCKLES. \nJENNY (CONT'D)                           * And I found a love in cooking. I've                * got my own catering business now.                  * And...maybe I just replaced alcohol with chocolate chips and cigarettes, but still...it's been years since I woke up in a park -- in a different state. \nLAUGHTER. \nKate leans in towards Mr. Davies and whispers -- \nKATE I kinda like her. \nMR. DAVIES Sponsor potential? \nKate nods. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) Get her number at break. \nKATE I feel like you're my wingman. \nKate grins at Mr. Davies, who smiles shyly and glances away. \nLATER \nAn older man -- ARLO -- stands and announces. \nARLO                                    * Arlo, Alcoholic. There'll now be a ten minute break. Smoke em' if you got em. \nAs some of the PEOPLE go outside -- \n-- Kate walks over to Jenny, who's getting a cup of coffee.    * \nKATE Hey, I liked your speech. \nJENNY                                  * Thanks. All that dumb shit happened so I'm glad that now it's at least entertaining. (beat) What's your name? \nKATE Kate. This is my first meeting. Or... first meeting where I'm not wasted. \nJenny LAUGHS.                                                  * \nJENNY                                   * Oh, yeah -- I remember doing some of that. \nKATE I don't really know how this stuff works. (MORE) \nKATE (CONT'D) But...could I get your number? I mean, I may not need it, but... \nJENNY                                     * Yeah, of course. I can help explain it to you -- and also, we can just talk. \nKATE Okay. Yeah. (beat) You've been sober since you were \nJenny nods.                                                   * \nKATE (CONT'D) That seems really young. \nJENNY                                    * I didn't have much of a choice -- I crashed my car into a nursing home. (beat) I think the break is just about over. This meeting is the kind where everyone can share. Sharing always helps me, so...if it's not too weird -- try introducing yourself and telling the group what's going on. \nLATER \nEveryone is sitting down and sharing. The woman (TINA) next   * to Kate is finishing up. \nTINA                                      * ...anyway, that's where I'm at today. Thanks for listening. \nEveryone looks at Kate. \nKATE Okay, um...hello. I'm Kate and... (long beat) ...I'm an alcoholic? \nKate nervously LAUGHS. \nGROUP Hi, Kate. \nKATE Sorry. I don't mean to laugh -- it's just saying those words... (beat) ...I think I'm an alcoholic, but I don't really know. I drink -- a lot. I've always drank. Everyone I know drinks a lot. I never really thought I had a problem -- lately though it seems like maybe I do. I just want to be able to drink a beer without it turning into twenty -- or wetting my bed. (beat) It seems like every time I drink something awful happens. All the shit that I used to laugh off isn't really funny anymore. The dumb drunk stuff has gone from embarrassing to scary. (beat) I'm kinda...scared. \nKate stops. Looks around self-consciously. \nCUT TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: A SERIES OF short, quick scenes: \n43   EXT. JENNY'S CATERING BUSINESS - NIGHT                       43   * \nKate -- who eats a piece of CAKE -- sits on a patio with          * Jenny, Mr. Davies, and several other PEOPLE from AA.              * \nJENNY                                         * I'm really proud of you, Kate. \nKATE I kinda can't believe it's been ninety days. (beat) The longest I've gone since high school without drinking was, like, a week. \nMR. DAVIES My first three months were such hell. I think I'm only sober today because I just never want to go through that again. \nKATE It's weird -- in after-school specials the getting-sober part was only like a minute of the movie and suddenly...daddy's all okay. \nSeveral people LAUGH. \nKATE (CONT'D) But it's so fucking hard and weird and suddenly I have all these other problems now that drinking isn't the problem. \nJENNY                          * Like what?                                  * \nKATE Everything else. Work, my non- existent relationship with my mom... \nJENNY                             * When was the last time you saw her? \nKATE (tries to remember) A year, at least. \nJENNY                             * Well...maybe it's time. \nKATE Maybe. (beat) And then there's my marriage. I mean, Charlie's great. Really great, he's supportive, especially at first. It's strange, though. I feel like alcohol was the thing that connected us and now that I don't drink we lead these two very different lives. (beat) We haven't slept together in forever... (laughs) I haven't pissed myself in awhile, though. So that's good. \nJENNY                             * It takes time. \nKate gives an exasperated look. \nJENNY (CONT'D)                    * (half-stern cheerleader tone) Keep working the steps. (glances at her watch) Let's grab coffee tomorrow, okay? I should actually run you home now and come back. I need to start locking up. \nKATE I could stick around and help you... \nMR. DAVIES (to Kate) I could take you home. (off Kate's reaction) If you want. \n44   INT./EXT. MR. DAVIES' CAR - NIGHT                 44   * \nMr. Davies pulls up to Kate's house. \nMR. DAVIES My ex-wife -- she doesn't drink -- well, not like us, but as soon as I got sober I started to change and she just...didn't. \nKATE I didn't know you were married. \nBeat. \nMR. DAVIES Yeah, I was married once -- (laughs) -- in my other life. But I shouldn't be talking to you about this stuff. \nKATE Why? \nMR. DAVIES I don't know... \nKATE Because you're a dude we can't talk? I don't get that \"men stick with men, women stick with women\" stuff. \nMR. DAVIES Well, if you were sitting where I'm sitting you'd understand. \nKATE Are you trying to tell me that you have a crush on me? \nMR. DAVIES What am I, one of your students?            * Crush? \nKATE Yeah, crush. \nMR. DAVIES (long beat) I kind of do, yes. I have a crush on you. I know that's wrong -- you're newly sober and married and I shouldn't be thinking about you like that. But yeah, I should put that out on the table. (beat) Honesty. \nKATE It's okay. I think you're a really good guy. \nMR. DAVIES Oh, great -- good guys are the nerds that carry the pretty girls' books. \nKATE Oh, c'mon... \nMR. DAVIES I think you're beautiful. \nKate smiles bashfully. \nCHARLIE Well then why're you going? \nKATE (beat) We send her checks. But we never actually see her. Sometimes it feels like I'm paying her to not be in my life. I thought it would be nice to visit her. (beat) And Jenny thinks it would be a good         * idea. \nCharlie LAUGHS. \nKATE (CONT'D) What? \nCHARLIE I don't know...I mean, do you do everything your sponsor tells you to do? \nKATE No. Do you think I'm brainwashed or something? \nCHARLIE I dunno...it's been a long damn time since you've seen your mom. (beat) And you didn't listen when I suggested we visit her. \nKATE (suddenly gets that it's an ego thing for Charlie) Oh, baby -- I listen to you. This just...it felt like the right time. (beat) With all the changes I'm going through. \nCHARLIE Well, can I come with you? It'll be like a little vacation. \nKATE Um...I think I should go alone. \nCHARLIE Come on, if you do that you'll just get depressed. If I go we can try to make it fun. Go hiking and stuff. \nKATE Well, if you go, don't take this the wrong way but -- I'd like it if maybe you didn't drink. (beat) Just while we're there. \nCHARLIE (smiles) I think I can handle not drinking for like a day. \nKate smiles and snuggles up into Charlie's arms. \n46   INT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAY                           46 \nKate and Charlie drive and listen to MUSIC. \n47   OMITTED                                              47   * \n47A   OMITTED                                                  47A      * \n48    INT./EXT. SUBARU - LAKE ARROWHEAD - RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY \nKate and Charlie are parked in front of a -- \n-- HOUSE. Small. A little run-down. Sort of a vague ski cabin look. There's some dirty lawn furniture in the front yard as well as a DOZEN LAWN-GNOMES. \nCHARLIE Ah...the lawn-gnomes. I missed those guys. \nKate playfully punches Charlie in the shoulder. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) (waving to a lawn-gnome) Hi, Holger! \nKate LAUGHS. Long beat. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) So...we gonna go in? \nCharlie glances at Kate and reads the anxiety on her face. \n49    EXT. KATE'S MOTHER'S HOME - DAY                              49 \nKate and Charlie walk to the front door. \nKATE (unsettled) I should've brought something. \nCHARLIE You're fine. \nKATE Something, you know? Flowers, or... \nCHARLIE Wine? \nKATE No. Definitely not that. \nThey get to the door. Charlie looks at Kate -- who seems like she'd be okay if they ran back to the car. \nKATE (CONT'D) (conceding) Go on... \nCharlie KNOCKS. \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) S'minute! \nKATE (to Charlie; slightly annoyed) Drink if you want to, Charlie. (to Rochelle) Charlie didn't stop drinking. I'm doing it by myself. (beat) And...I started going to 12-step meetings. \nRochelle looks slightly disgusted. \nROCHELLE Ah...yes. Assholes Anonymous. (to Charlie) Katie's father went to those meetings a few years after we got married. Dried up. Left me. You can see how well that worked out for me... (Rochelle gestures to her living room) ...I raised his daughter in this PALACE while he's somewhere in Florida with his shiny new wife and kids. (beat) Bastard. (long beat; to Charlie) You better be careful -- they change. \nKate and Charlie exchange a glance. \nKATE I thought you'd be happy for me, mom. \nROCHELLE Oh...I'm sorry -- I'm not being a good hostess, am I? \nRochelle gets up, takes the drink away from Kate, and chugs it. \nROCHELLE (CONT'D) I'll microwave you your favorite. \nA FEW MOMENTS LATER \nCharlie, Kate, and Rochelle watch a REALITY TV SHOW -- while eating... \n...MCDONALDS CHEESEBURGERS.                                      * \nRochelle rests her head on Kate's shoulder. \nROCHELLE (CONT'D) I'm sorry if I acted like a bitch. \nKATE It's okay, mom. I know you can't help it. \n51   EXT. LAKE ARROWHEAD - SANTA'S VILLAGE - DAY                 51 \nKate and Charlie wander around Santa's Village -- \n-- an abandoned Christmas-themed amusement park (with giant ginger bread houses, plastic Christmas trees, etc.) in the middle of the woods. Creepy and nostalgic at the same time. Looks like the set of a Christmas horror film. \nKate holds Charlie's hand as she leads him around. \nKATE This place shut down a decade ago and then there was a fire and now it's basically abandoned. \nCharlie seems totally impressed by the weirdness of the place. \nKATE (CONT'D) We came here every year the week before Christmas. (MORE) \nKATE (CONT'D) And then I worked here in high school -- selling hot chocolate. And they had real reindeer, too. They kept `em over there. \nKate points at the remains of a PEN. \nKATE (CONT'D) My mom worked here when she was younger. I think everyone who grew                  * up around here worked at Santa's Village at some point. \nCharlie just nods and listens -- he's in awe of this place. \nKATE (CONT'D) This is what I think of when I think of Christmas. (long beat) Thanks for coming up here with me. \nCHARLIE Of course. \nKATE I'm sorry my mom's so awful. \nCHARLIE (shrugs) She just can't handle her liquor. \nKate and Charlie look in each other's eyes. Seem to have a moment. And then Charlie asks -- \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Did you ever hook up with guys when you worked here? \nKATE Huh? \nCHARLIE You know -- sneak off with a co- worker and do it against a pine tree or something? \nKATE Um...no. \nCHARLIE I mean, if I were a teenage boy working with a stone cold fox like you I'd totally want to hook up with you here. Like...in the ginger bread house. \nCharlie puts his arms around Kate. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) You were probably the coolest girl in town -- and the prettiest. I'm sure everyone was in love with you. \nKate giggles. They kiss. It's sweet. \nKATE No -- you don't have to do that. I didn't even tell him. But...you can't say that to a girl -- like, ever. \nMR. DAVIES Okay. \nKATE Seriously. Consider that a rule of thumb. (beat) Someday, you're gonna meet a nice, available lady -- but if you say \"moist pussy\" to her, you will never, ever, ever get to see that part of her body! \nMR. DAVIES (even more embarrassed) Okay. (beat) Thank you. (nods) I feel like this was a really good talk. \nKate forces a smile. \n55   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT             55 \nKate stares at a -- \n-- HALF-EATEN BIRTHDAY CAKE (\"OWEN\" is still sort of legible) on the kitchen table. It's totally mutilated. \nShe walks out the back door into the                            * \nBACKYARD                                                        * \nwhere she finds                                                 * \nCharlie, Owen, and one of Owen's friends --                     * \n-- GREG, 21 --                                                  * \n-- listening to loud MUSIC while they play FOOSBALL.            * \nThey're all SHIT-HOUSED.                                        * \nGREG                                       * ...getting married would fucking                     * suck.

What you're gonna say? \nKate shakes her head. \nKATE I don't know what I'm gonna do about anything. \nJENNY                                         * Listen...you wanna stay in my guest                     * room tonight?

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY            63 \nPrincipal Barnes hugs Kate. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES I'm so sorry, Kate. (beat) I haven't told many people this, but when I was young -- younger than you...I lost a child too. \nKate's stunned. Looks like she feels terrible. \nKATE I'm...I'm really sorry. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES It's okay. It was a long, long time ago. Still hurts sometimes. But eventually...you move on. You have to. (beat) Have a seat. \nKate sits down. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D) I got a phone call from a very upset parent. That's how I found out about...you know. Frankly, I'm not sure why you didn't feel like you could tell me. \nKATE I freaked out -- a student asked why I wasn't fat and I just froze up and then another student was saying I killed my baby and I didn't know what to do. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES I'm not angry with you -- but I need to be clear that this doesn't happen again. \nKATE It won't. I promise that. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES By \"not happening again,\" I mean that you don't discuss any controversial topics -- things the school board deems \"family matters\" with your class. (beat) No sex. No god. No drugs and alcohol. \nKATE Okay, I... \nKate straightens up in her seat, takes a deep breath. She seems...exhausted. \nKATE (CONT'D) ...I can't keep doing this. I feel awful. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES (confused) I know this all must be hard for you -- \nKATE No. You don't understand. (beat) I have to be honest with you. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES What do you mean? \nKATE Principal Barnes...I wasn't ever pregnant. \nPrincipal Barnes looks shocked. \nKATE (CONT'D) I lied -- to the class and to you -- because I was scared. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES But...you vomited in class. \nKATE I know. And when that happened I didn't know what to do because the truth is -- \nPRINCIPAL BARNES Oh, my god -- are you really ill? Is it cancer? \nKATE No, well, yes. I have a disease, but, um... (beat) ...it's alcoholism. \nPrincipal Barnes goes from concerned -- to angry. \nMr. Davies awkwardly puts his arm around Kate's shoulder. \nMR. DAVIES I'm sorry. I wish there was something I could do. \nKATE I'm a fuck-up. I'll always be a fuck up. I'm just like my mom. \nMR. DAVIES (confused) No, no -- you're a wonderful, smart woman Kate. You can't let this get you down. \nKATE I gotta go. \nMr. Davies takes Kate's box of things from her. \nMR. DAVIES Let me walk you to your car. \nKate throws her arms around Mr. Davies and begins to -- \n-- full-on SOB. \nMr. Davies seems flustered and a little scared but tries to comfort Kate. \n65   INT.

DIVE BAR - DAY                                          66 \nKate walks into a near-empty, depressing dive. She nervously sits at the bar. \nThe BARTENDER -- a gruff looking guy with the sleeves rolled      * up -- approaches. \nBARTENDER What do you need? \nKATE Whiskey. Double. \nThe bartender gives Kate her drink. Kate immediately downs it. \nKATE (CONT'D) Can I have another one? \nBARTENDER Sure -- you gotta pay for the first one, though. Eight bucks. \nKate puts a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL down. \nThe bartender pours her another shot. \nLATER \nKate has clearly been drinking for awhile -- she's curled up at the bar, nursing her BEER. \nBARTENDER (CONT'D) Look, Miss -- I don't wanna be a downer or anything `cause I take it you've had a bad day, but um... I think you need to go home. \nKATE Why? \nBARTENDER Cause you're pretty drunk -- and it's four p.m. \nKATE What about him? \nKate points to an old CRUSTY MAN at the other end of the bar. \nKATE (CONT'D) You're not kicking him out. \nBARTENDER I'm just trying to be a pal. \nKATE Stop it -- you aren't my pal. I just got fired, and I just quit AA. (beat) It didn't work. \nBARTENDER Oh, boy... \nKATE You know what? I was fine -- had a husband that loved me and maybe I sometimes did embarrassing stuff, but it was a phase. (MORE) \nKATE (CONT'D) I go to AA and sober my husband and I start fighting and stop fucking -- and sober I get fired! Isn't that what's supposed to not happen? \n-- Kate stumbles to her front door. \nJENNY                                     * Kate!

It's insane. \nKate says nothing. Just stares at Charlie. \nCharlie looks up -- and is surprised to see Kate clearly drunk. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Whoa...what happened to you? \nCharlie stops playing the game. \nKATE I'm drunk. I'm fired from my job. \nCHARLIE Oh, no... \nKATE We got any drinks? \nCHARLIE Uh...we have soda. I can make coffee. \nKATE Don't be cute with me. You know what I mean. \nCHARLIE So...I guess you aren't doing the AA thing anymore? \nKATE What gave that away? \nKate turns and goes to the kitchen -- \n-- reappearing a moment later with a BOTTLE OF TEQUILA, salt and limes. \nKATE (CONT'D) Come on, baby -- let's do some shots. \nCHARLIE What's going on? \nKATE I'm celebrating. What the fuck does it look like? \nKate takes a shot. \nKATE (CONT'D) Are you gonna be a little girl or are you gonna drink with me? \nCHARLIE I don't know what the right thing to do here is. \nKATE Okay, so let me see if this makes sense: you say you miss the old Kate -- the Kate who drinks and blacks out and has fun. (beat) Well...here she is. \nKate smiles -- but she looks more desperate and drunk than fun. \nCHARLIE Baby, I didn't mean that. I was just being a jerk. \nKATE Fuck yeah you were. And what? Now you won't drink with me? \nCHARLIE I don't know. Having a beer or something is one thing, but...I think you really may have a problem. \nKate LAUGHS. \nKATE Well thanks for all the support when I was trying to be sober! \nKate takes another shot. \nCHARLIE I'm sorry. I didn't realize -- \nKATE Of course you didn't realize! You don't fucking care about me. \nCHARLIE What are you talking about?! Of course I care about you. I love you. \nKate takes a shot and approaches Charlie. \nKATE No. \nCharlie seems relieved. \nCHARLIE Me either. Owen keeps trying to get me to be his \"wing-man\" and it's ridiculous and these girls in bars are so lame and I just keep thinking how I wish I was meeting you in a bar for the first time and I didn't come with any baggage and I could buy you a drink and flirt with you all night and ask for your number. (beat) Wanna go out sometime? \nKATE I don't think it's a good idea. \nCharlie nods. Long beat. \nCHARLIE I fucked up, didn't I? \nKate looks down, doesn't speak. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Yeah, I did. I know I did. I had a beautiful woman who used to love me and now when I see her she doesn't even want to look me in the eyes. \nKATE Charlie, please don't do this. \nCHARLIE I miss you. I miss the way you taste and smell and...I miss things about you that used to drive me nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's music and fake punk-rock from the 90's... \nKATE I don't like shitty 80's music. (beat) I like good 80's music. \nCHARLIE ...and all I want to do is touch you one more time to just, remember -- to make sure it was real. \nSilence. Kate looks Charlie in the eyes and gives him a slight smile. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) (changing course) Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional fucking idiot. \n76   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY      76   * \nKate and Charlie walk in -- it looks sort of the same, but a number of items are missing, and it's messier. In general, the room looks more \"dude.\" \nKATE You look really thin. \nCHARLIE Yeah? \nKATE When did you last eat? \nCHARLIE I dunno -- like...I'm not sure. (seems slightly concerned                           * that he can't remember) I think, um... \nKATE Should we order something? \nCHARLIE Sure, yeah -- or I could make a bacon and egg sandwich... \nKATE I don't know. I haven't really been doing the meat thing. \nCHARLIE Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then meat. (beat) Have you given up fun, too? \nKate looks at Charlie -- he's half-smiling, not sure if she finds him funny. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) (off Kate) Sorry. Bad joke. \nKate cracks a smile. \nKATE Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But I'm gonna make them. \nCharlie raises his eyebrows. \nCHARLIE Okay... \nLATER \nKate's at the stove, cooking bacon and eggs. \nCharlie goes to the FRIDGE and gets a BOTTLE OF BEER. \nKate glances at him. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Sorry. \nCharlie puts the beer back in the fridge. \nKATE I don't care if you drink a beer. \nCHARLIE You sure? \n", "test1_input": "KATE (CONT'D) I puked in front of my class and then told everyone I'm pregnant. That's not really okay, huh? \nMR. DAVIES No, I don't think so. \nKATE I went to AA last night. \nMR. DAVIES (slightly uncomfortable) Oh, yeah? What'd you think of it? \nKATE It was awful. I kept getting shushed. \nMR. DAVIES I don't normally tell people I work with this... but -- \nMr. Davies takes a COIN that says \"Nine Years\" out of his pocket and shows it to Kate. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) -- I'm a bit of an expert when it comes to these things. \nKATE (shocked) You? \nMR. DAVIES Yeah, me. I've lived a strange one.                    * I'm nine years sober, AA and NA. (beat) I used to drink cocaine. (off Kate's shocked expression) It's really cheap in the Philippines. \nMr. Davies takes a beat to think about what he's saying. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) Listen, Kate. I know meetings can be weird. Especially at first, but if you want to...you never need to feel like you have to...but the ones I go to are pretty small. Nice little groups. (beat) I'd be happy to take you. \nKATE Maybe that would be good...I don't know. \nMR. DAVIES No pressure, okay. That shit saved my life, though. \nPrincipal Barnes walks in. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) (switching gears) Well, I'm scheduled to observe Ms. Carol's art class. They're making macaroni art, so...I'm pretty stoked. \nMr. Davies gets up to leave -- discretely winking at Kate as he exits. \nPrincipal Barnes watches Mr. Davies leave, a puzzled expression on her face. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES (to Kate) Mrs. Hannah -- I've got something for you... \nPrincipal Barnes opens the MINI FRIDGE to reveal a huge jug of ORANGE JUICE. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D) Folic Acid! You need it now like never before. \nKATE (beat) Thanks. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES I bet your mother is over the moon, huh? Probably planning you a baby shower...? \nKATE Oh, well...she and I aren't that close. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES Oh, I'm sorry. Well, listen -- any motherly thing you need -- I'm                       * here, okay? \nBarnes hands Kate a large glass of juice. \nPRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D) Now drink up -- that baby in there's thirsty! \nKATE Okay. (takes a sip of orange juice) And...you're kinda the only person at school -- besides Mr. Davies -- who knows I'm pregnant. Could you...? \nPRINCIPAL BARNES My lips are -- \nPrincipal Barnes mimes \"zipping\" her lips. \n32   EXT./INT.

An old record PLAYS on the record player. \nKATE Hey... \nCHARLIE Howdy. \nKate collapses on the couch next to Charlie and kisses him. \nKATE How was your day? And what's that smell? \nCHARLIE Eh -- alright. Couldn't find oatmeal so I made ketchup soup. \n", "test1_true": "CHARLIE What? It's tasty.

Want to come with me and Owen to check it out? \nKATE Oh, that sounds fun, but... \nCHARLIE C'mon -- Owen can't pick up girls without you. \nKATE I don't know...this guy I work with -- Mr. Davies -- \nCHARLIE The Vice Principal? \nKATE Yeah -- turns out he's sober and invited me to a meeting. \nCHARLIE (surprised) Wow, that's...uh, cool. \nCharlie goes silent. \nKATE What? \nCHARLIE Nothing -- I just...I didn't think you really loved the meeting you went to yesterday. In fact, it sounded like you hated it. So I'm kinda surprised you're going back. \nKATE Well...this is a smaller meeting. It might be different. I dunno -- I think I want to give it a fair shot. \nCharlie nods. \nKATE (CONT'D) Besides -- I was hammered last night. (beat) Go on and have fun out drinking with Owen tonight. Seriously. I'm just gonna, you know, try something         * different... \nCharlie pulls Kate close to him. \nCHARLIE I'm here for you, okay? Even though I drink -- I could slow down if you need me to.

CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nMr. Davies walks Kate into a medium sized room where -- \n-- about TEN PEOPLE are getting coffee, talking, and setting CHAIRS IN A CIRCLE. \nKate looks around the room, scoping out the people, who're very different from the crowd at the previous night's meeting \n-- several BLUE COLLAR MEN -- \n-- JENNY: 40-ish, with dark hair and a confident, sort of        * tough demeanor -- \n-- a few OLDER PEOPLE, and a YOUNG COUPLE. \nMr. Davies directs Kate over to a table with COFFEE and COOKIES. \nMR. DAVIES This is a little more my speed. No one here is the slightest bit hip. \nKATE Does everybody just...kinda, you know -- talk here? \nMR. DAVIES Pretty much. Someone leads -- tells their story. And then everyone else shares -- talks. \nKATE So since you're taking me here does that make you my sponsor? \nMR. DAVIES No -- I don't think I could do                     * that.

(gestures to the seats) We should sit down. \nKate looks around the room at everyone taking their seats. \nKATE (takes a deep breath; to Mr. Davies) I can't believe I'm really here. \nMR. DAVIES It gets better. Weirder, maybe -- but better. \nLATER \nThe meeting has begun and everyone sits in a circle of chairs. \nJenny is midway through her speech.                            * \nJENNY                                   * ...all I knew about taking care of myself was fucking people over and lying to get by.

Okay, listen kids -- we shouldn't be talking about this. But...

(beat) It's called a miscarriage.   That means it wasn't my plan --   it's just what happened. (composes herself) Does anyone want to ask me   any questions? \nThe class nods but seems silently freaked out. \nKATE (CONT'D) Let's get back to subtraction -- or addition. Or both. \n59   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY        59 \nKate sits with Mr. Davies eating lunch. \nMR. DAVIES Well, that was bound to happen at some point. Kids notice things like that. \nKate nods. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) But I had no idea how pro-life little Winnie Reddy is.                        * (beat) Remind me to wear my \"May the fetus you save be gay\" T-shirt to the next banana split night. \nKate half-laughs. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) And just think: the kids got a lesson about life and death that nobody planned on. I mean, you're years ahead of the standard curriculum for, uh, third graders. \nKATE Does it matter that I lied? That I was never pregnant? \nMR. DAVIES You want me to answer that as a friend or as someone who takes the twelve steps very seriously? \nKate shrugs. \nMR. DAVIES (CONT'D) Well, the good thing is that it's all over now. Principal Barnes will think you're a martyr for losing a baby. (beat) The kids won't ask about it anymore and as long as you don't toss your cookies again you won't have to deal with it. \nKATE (long beat) And the bad news? \nMR. DAVIES You lied. To your boss -- and a bunch of small children. Who trust you. And rely on you to help them differentiate right from wrong. \nKATE (slowly nods) That's all, huh? \n60   INT.

Puts down her phone. \nKATE (fake enthusiasm) So...what'd you do today, honey? \nCHARLIE I finished some writing and met up with Owen to watch the game and toss a few back. Dear. (beat) You do anything special? \nKATE I lied to my class again. I told them that I had a miscarriage. \nCharlie LAUGHS. \nKATE (CONT'D) That's not funny. \nCHARLIE Yeah, it is. Telling kids fucked-up stuff is totally funny...in, you know -- a kinda fucked-up way. \nKATE Great, well -- I'm glad I'm not actually having a baby. \n", "test2_true": "KATE Well, I feel like a piece of shit for lying. \nCHARLIE It's not that big a deal. Jesus. Is this what those meetings teach you? To make drama out of nothing? \nKATE It's not nothing. I lied to little kids and to my boss because I can't take responsibility for my actions. \nCHARLIE Why don't you go and tell the Principal that you were never pregnant? That the reason you puked is because you smoked crack all night? Would you feel better about yourself then? \nBeat. \nKATE I've been thinking about doing that, actually. (thinks about it) Yeah. I think I would feel better about myself. \nCHARLIE Fine. Do it, then. I guess you don't need a job. \nKATE I could be like you -- I could stay home drinking all day and never do anything responsible. \nCHARLIE (hurt) I never do anything responsible? What about buying this house that we live in? Or the food that we're eating? \nKATE Having rich parents doesn't make you responsible. I think it's pretty much done the opposite. \nCharlie looks stunned.                                 * \nCHARLIE Oh, I'm sorry that I have a family that supports us -- and not the other way around. \nKATE What the fuck is that supposed to mean? \nCHARLIE Nothing, Kate. But you can't be mad at me because my family has helped us out. You should be grateful we don't have to struggle. \nKATE I wouldn't care if we struggled with money. I've struggled with money my whole life. (beat) I'd rather worry about where my next meal is coming from than if I - - in some drunken stupor -- married a man who just wants to party and meet bands. \nCHARLIE What the fuck are you talking about? \nKATE I'm talking about you being a baby. A selfish baby. \nCHARLIE You know what? \nKATE What? \nCHARLIE I fucking hate AA! It turned you into a bitch. A brain-washed bitch. \nKATE At least I'm not drunk all the time. \nCHARLIE Yeah, you don't drink booze for three months and suddenly you're some saint? You have it all together and I'm just a baby? \nKate doesn't answer. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) I'm trying, Kate. I'm trying to understand you. But it's hard. You're different and maybe it's good that you're different. Maybe I'm bad and bad for you or something -- because I didn't think the person you were before was so awful. I loved that person. Yeah, she drank a lot and she did some silly things...but she was my Kate. \nKATE You loved that person? Do you not love me now? \nCHARLIE Yeah, of course. But it's different. You're different. \nKATE Before I was a mess.

(beat) I'd piss my pants, but I was still cute. \nPeople in the crowd LAUGH a little bit. \nKATE (CONT'D) When I first tried getting sober, I figured that as long as I didn't drink...everything else would just magically work out. But it didn't. (beat) My marriage fell apart. I got fired from my job. And that shit happened SOBER! I never read that in any pamphlet... (shakes her head) ...that isn't what I signed up for. (beat) Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty slogan I've heard in the rooms is that when you're sober for a bit and drink again \"the disease waits for you, picks up where it left off.\" (beat) I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE those slogans. They all sound like bumper stickers. But, I have to admit...for me, that last one is pretty damn true. (beat) When I drink...I become another person. And that person is a pretty big asshole. Well, unless you want to give me drugs or buy me drinks -- then that person is awesome. \nPeople knowingly LAUGH. \nKATE (CONT'D) I wasn't happy being the \"good-time girl,\" though. And honestly, I wasn't very good at it. (MORE) \nKATE (CONT'D) (beat) My life is really different than it was a year ago. I live alone. I'm bored a lot more. I have a job that pays a lot less.

That's when I met Crash, here. (gestures to Charlie) He'd been sent down to single-A to teach me how to carry myself as a pro ball-player. We got involved with the same woman -- an older chick -- but Crash won her in the end. (beat) He's really taught me some...important life-lessons. \nMillie nods. \nMILLIE Wow...that's a pretty crazy way to meet. \nOWEN Yeah. It is. \nMILLIE You guys are sorta like that movie...what's it called? \nOWEN (plays dumb) I don't know. Which one?

What is it? \nCharlie and Owen feign ignorance. \nMILLIE (CONT'D) Whatever. It'll come to me.

But print really is dead. So now most of my stuff winds up on websites. Which is depressing. `Cause you can't hold it -- you can just look at it. It's like... \nCharlie seems lost in drunken thought.

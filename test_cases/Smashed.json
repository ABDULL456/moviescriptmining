McDonald's used to have one day a week where they sold 29 cent hamburgers, and another day where they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My mom and me would go there and she'd get twenty burgers -- that was the limit, probably set up for folks just like us -- and then she'd put `em in the freezer and we'd microwave `em for dinner throughout the week.

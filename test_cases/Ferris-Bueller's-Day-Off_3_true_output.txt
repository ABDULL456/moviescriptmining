Ferris walks in and flops down in an armchair. 
FERRIS There's alot of pressure at work in my age group. And it's not always recognized. 
He reaches over and picks up the telephone. He sets it in his lap. 
FERRIS Some guy whose hair is falling out and his stomach's hanging over his belt and everything he eats makes him fart, he looks at someone like me and thinks, "This kid's young and strong and has a full, rich future ahead of him, what's he got to bitch about?" 
20  CU. PHONE                                                    20 
He punches out a number. 
21  INT. FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS                                     21 
He remote controls the TV on. 
FERRIS That's just one reason why I need a day off every now and then. 
22  EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE                                           22 
A sleek, modern house on a couple of deeply wooded acres. A prime house in a prime location. A telephone rings OVER. 
23  INT. BOY'S BEDROOM                                           23 
It's a dark, dreary sick room. Shades drawn, floor strewn with used tissues, nightstand a still-life of over the counter remedies. A high school boy, CAMERON FRYE, is laying in bed. We don't see his face, only a silhouette with a thermometer sticking out his mouth. U2's SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY is playing. He's mumbling random words. 
CAMERON Food...shelter...no...yes... 
The phone rings. His hand reaches back and hits the speaker phone button. 
CAMERON (weak) Hello? 
FERRIS' VOICE Cameron! What's happening? 
CAMERON Very little. 
FERRIS' VOICE How do you feel? 
CAMERON Shredded. 
FERRIS' VOICE Is your mother in the room? 
Cameron takes the thermometer out of his mouth. 
CAMERON She's not home. Where are you? 
FERRIS' VOICE Home. 
24  INT. FERRIS' FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS                             24 
Ferris is sprawled out in the chair. 
FERRIS I'm taking the day off. Get dressed and come over. 
CAMERON'S VOICE I can't. I'm sick. 
FERRIS It's all in your head. Come on over. 
25  INT. CAMERON'S ROOM                                          25 
Cameron's insistant. 
CAMERON I feel like complete shit, Ferris. I can't go anywhere. 
FERRIS' VOICE I'm sorry to hear that. Now, come on over and pick me up. 
Ferris disconnects. Cameron slowly hangs up the phone. 
CAMERON I'm dying. 
The phone rings again. Cameron hits the speaker button. 
FERRIS' VOICE You're not dying. You just can't think of anything good to do. 
26  INT. FERRIS' FAMILY ROOM                                     26 
Ferris hangs up. 
FERRIS If anybody needs a day off, it's Cameron. He has alot of things to sort out before he graduates. He can't be wound this tight and go to college. His roommate'll kill him. I've come close myself. But I like him. He's a little easier to take when you know why he's like he is. The boy cannot relax. Pardon by French but Cameron is so tight that if you stuck a lump of coal up his ass, in two weeks you'd have a diamond. (after-thought) And Cameron would worry that he'd owe taxes on it. 
27  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         27 
We hear roll call as CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the tile floor. A shoe's POV. 
TEACHER'S VOICE Albers? 
BOY'S VOICE Here. 
TEACHER'S VOICE Anderson. 
GIRL'S VOICE Here. 
CAMERA enters a classroom. It travels past a teacher's Hush Puppies and heads up an aisle of desk past dirty yellow Reebocks, rotting Air Jordans, scuffed heels, pristine loafers... 
TEACHER'S VOICE Anheiser? 
BOY'S VOICE Here. 
TEACHER'S VOICE Busch? 
GIRL'S VOICE Here. 
TEACHER'S VOICE Bueller? 
CAMERA reaches the last desk and rises slowly to reveal that it's empty.

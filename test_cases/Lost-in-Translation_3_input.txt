CUT TO: 
EXT. SHIBUYA - DAY 
Charlotte walks up a little street filled with shops. 
She stops at a window of cute underwear that she.looks at. She goes into the shop. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
51C.U. Charlotte's lips. She puts watermelon color lipstick on.She looks at herself in the mirror in her new underwear. 
CUT TO: 
We hear the shower running in the bathroom. 
Charlotte decorates the room, putting up some paper cherry blossom decorations. 
She goes over to the bed and stubs her toe on it, as she flops down. 
CHARLOTTE Ouch. 
She holds her toe, annoyed with her klutziness. 
John talks to her from the shower. 
JOHN (O.C.) At the fitting, they had all these rock n roll clothes, the label guys kept saying lock n loll, though, but the band doesn't look tough at all...they look better just skinny and nerdy, like how when they came in...they looked so uncomfortable in these Keith Richards clothes, they should just be like they are, don't you think? 
She's drifted off. 
CHARLOTTE Yeah. 
JOHN Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to... 
He gets out and is rushing to get his stuff together to go. Charlotte's lounging on the bed in her new pink underwear. 
She tries her scarf on that she's been knitting. 
CHARLOTTE Do you think it's done? 
JOHN I don't know. 
He goes to get all his stuff together. 
He passes an ashtray with cigarette butts in it. 
JOHN Will you please stop smoking? 
CHARLOTTE But I like to... and I don't smoke that much. 
JOHN Its bad for you.

{"train": "THE PIANIST \nby Ronald Harwood \nbased on the published memoir by Wladyslaw Szpilman \nFinal Draft, 1998 \nNote: Unless otherwise indicated, all dialogue spoken by Germans will be in the German language and subtitled. \nFADE IN: \nINT. WARSAW (ARCHIVE) - DAY \nBlack and white. Street scene. People toing and froing.  A man rattles by. \nSUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: \nWARSAW 1939 \nINT. STUDIO, RADIO STATION, WARSAW - DAY \nWLADYSLAV SZPILMAN plays Chopin's Nocturne in C sharp minor, Posthumous. He's twenty-eight years old, elegant and handsome. \nIn the booth, separated from the studio by a glass screen, an engineer, wearing collar and tie, monitors the broadcast. Behind him, a window to the street with strips of paper taped on it as protection against blast. \nWithout warning, a bomb drops nearby, then another and another. The whole building shudders alarmingly and the window in the booth shatters. \nThe engineer and Szpilman exchange a look as a man enters the booth and talks urgently to the Engineer, then goes. \nThe engineer makes a 'cut-throat' gesture, but Szpilman shakes his head, determined to play on. \nHe plays, then glances at the booth. The engineer has gone, but through the shattered window he sees fires raging. \nVery near, a loud, terrifying explosion. The reverberations cause plaster to flake and dust to trickle down over his face. \nAnd then a bomb explodes even closer. The glass screen separating booth from studio implodes, showering Szpilman with glass. He stops, frozen. \nINT. STAIRS AND LOBBY, RADIO STATION - DAY \nPandemonium. Chaos. People rushing in all directions, many carrying files, boxes, papers, shouting, calling. Some of the men in military uniform. The bombing continuous. Szpilman fights his way down the stairs. He has a small cut on his forehead and is dabbing it with his handkerchief. He has a dazed look. Halfway down the stairs, A young woman, DOROTA, tugs at his sleeve: \nDOROTA Mr. Szpilman. \nHe turns, to see an extremely pretty young woman gazing adoringly at him while they're jostled and shoved. His eyes light up. \nSZPILMAN Hello. \nDOROTA I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose. \nSZPILMAN Who are you? \nDOROTA My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding. \nSZPILMAN It's nothing. \nJUREK pushes in beside them and takes her arm. \nJUREK C'mon, Dorota, you can write him a fan letter later, this isn't the best time, c'mon. \nJurek, pulling Dorota, fights his way down the stairs. \nSZPILMAN (calling) Jurek, why have you been hiding her? \nAnd he, too, is carried with the flow into the lobby. Debris everywhere. Szpilman fights to get to the main door, when another bomb explodes, filling the air with dust and debris, obscuring him and everyone else. \nINT. WARSAW APARTMENT - DUSK \nThe Szpilman family in panic: coming and going out of rooms, packing clothes and belongings into open suitcases and a trunk in a comfortable, tastefully furnished bourgeois apartment, the living room lined with books, paintings and boasting a boudoir grand, silver platters and candlesticks. The family consist of MOTHER, in a state of great anxiety, FATHER, REGINA, twenty-six, HALINA, twenty-two, and HENRYK, twenty-four, the only one not in movement. He sits by the radio set, ear to the speaker, trying to tune to a station. No bombs now, just the distant sound of artillery fire. Father, holding a silver-framed photograph, crosses to Mother. \nFATHER What you think, should I take Uncle Szymon's photograph? \nMOTHER Take it, don't take it, take what you like. Can't you see I'm worried sick? \nFATHER He'll come home, he'll be all right. \nHe goes into his room. She can barely control her tears and hurries into the kitchen just as the front door opens and Szpilman enters, looks round bemused by the activity. \nThey gather round. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER ... an important announcement. News has just been received through the BBC that Great Britain, having had no reply... (static) ...and therefore has declared war on Nazi Germany... (a collective gasp) ... next few hours... awaiting latest news... \nHenryk hits the set. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER ... but France is expected to make a similar announcement... (static) ... Poland is no longer alone. \nThe Polish national anthem plays. All are still. \nINT. WARSAW APARTMENT - NIGHT \nFather pours liqueur into glasses. \nThe family are seated around the dining table, having just finished a meal. The table groans with the remains of the dinner. Szpilman has a plaster over his cut. \nHENRYK (lighting up a cigarette) Mama, that was a great dinner. \nSZPILMAN It certainly was. \nMOTHER When there's something to celebrate, you've got to make an effort. \nThe glasses are handed round. \nFATHER Here's to Great Britain and France. \nThey all clink glasses and drink. \nFATHER I told you. Didn't I tell you? All will be well. \nEXT. RUINED WARSAW STREET - DAY \nA column of German Soldiers, led by an officer on horseback, march into view. \nOn the sidewalk of the street, with its buildings in ruins, smoke still rising, stand onlookers, including Szpilman and Henryk, and a little behind them, Father, craning to see. They watch, expressionless, as the Germans march past. \nINT. WARSAW APARTMENT - DAY \nRegina is opening and closing the window, examining the frame with her fingers. Halina is on a box, removing and replacing books. Mother sits at one end of the table, polishing a man's watch and chain. At the other end, Father sits counting a small stack of notes and coins. Henryk is deep in thought and Szpilman is fiddling with his father's violin. The apartment has less furniture now and the silver has gone. \nFATHER (finishing the counting) Five thousand and three. \nMOTHER Is that all? \nFATHER Yes, five thousand and three zlotys, that's all we've got left. \nREGINA It's three thousand and three zlotys too much, (reading from newspaper) 'Re: Further restrictions regarding liquid assets: Jews will be allowed to keep a maximum of two thousand zlotys in their homes.' \nMOTHER What are we supposed to do with the rest? \nHALINA Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account. \nHENRYK Banks? Who'd be stupid enough to deposit money in a German bank? \nREGINA We could hide the money here in the window frame. \nFATHER No, no, no. I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll use tried and tested methods. You know what we did in the last war? We made a hole in the table leg and we hid the money in there. \nHENRYK And suppose they take the table away? \nMOTHER What d'you mean, take the table away? \nHENRYK The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything. \nMOTHER Do they? \nFATHER Idiot! What would they want with a table? \nAll look at the table: it's covered in stains and the veneer is coming away at one end. A table like this? \nHe pokes his finger under the veneer. It snaps, revealing bare wood beneath. \nMOTHER What on earth are you doing? \nHALINA There's a good place under the cupboard. \nHENRYK No, no. Listen, I've been thinking -- \nSZPILMAN Wladek, please. \nAmidst their laughter, he takes her hand and kisses it. \nINT. WARSAW APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe family are gathered around the table, listening to Father reading from the newspaper. \nThe apartment has even less furniture now. The paintings are gone. \nFATHER (reading) 'Re: emblems for Jews in the Warsaw District. I hereby order that all Jews in the Warsaw District will wear visible emblems when out of doors. This decree will come into force on the 1st December 1939 and applies to all Jews over twelve years of age. The emblem will be worn on the right sleeve and will represent a blue Star of David on a white background. The background must be sufficiently large for the Star to measure eight centimetres from point to point. The width of the arms of the Star (reading) must be one centimetre. Jews who do not respect this decree will be severely punished. Governor of Warsaw District, Dr. Fischer.' \nSilence. Then: \nHENRYK I won't wear it. \nREGINA won't wear it. I'm not going to be branded. \nSZPILMAN (grabbing the newspaper) Let me see this. \nFATHER Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them? \nHENRYK We're not going to get them. We're not going to wear them! \nSilence, each locked in their own thoughts. \nEXT. WARSAW STREET - DAY \nFather, wearing the Star of David armband, walks slowly along, carrying a string bag containing potatoes and carrots, his eyes fixed on the pavement as if his thoughts are a million miles away. \nHe passes two GERMAN OFFICERS. They stop. \nGERMAN OFFICER (a harsh shout) You! \nFather stops, turns fearfully and approaches the Germans. \nGERMAN OFFICER Why didn't you bow? \nFATHER (removing his hat) I'm sorry I... \nI German Officer cracks him hard across the face, catching his ear. Father reels, collects himself as best he can and starts to shuffle on - \nGERMAN OFFICER (calling after him) You are forbidden to walk on the pavement. Walk in the gutter! \nFather steps off the pavement and walks in the gutter. The German turn and go. Father walks on. \nINT. WARSAW APARTMENT - EVENING \nSzpilman composing at the piano. He plays, makes adjustments with a pencil to the manuscript, plays again. The flat is almost bare. Halina, enters with a newspaper. \nHALINA Have you seen this? \nSZPILMAN (irritated) What, I'm working, what? \nShe hands him the paper. He looks at it. His expression darkens. \nINSERT: \nthe newspaper. A map of the proposed Jewish area: two distinct districts, one large, one smaller. \nSZPILMAN'S VOICE What is it? \nHALINA'S VOICE That's where they're going to put us. \nSZPILMAN'S VOICE What d'you mean, put us? \nTHE APARTMENT: \nShe looks over his shoulder and reads. As she does so, the door of Henryk's room opens and he stands leaning in the doorway, watching, as if amused. \nHALINA 'By order of the Governor of the Warsaw District, Dr. Fischer, concerning the establishment of the Jewish District in Warsaw. There will be created a Jewish District in which all Jews living in Warsaw or moving to Warsaw will have to reside.\"  And look here: 'Jews living outside of the prescribed area will have to move to the Jewish district by 31st of October 1940.' \nSzpilman gazes at the map, horrified. \nSZPILMAN But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw! \nHENRYK No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy. \nTwo rooms on the third floor: a living room and a kitchen. The Szpilmans are unpacking their belongings in silence. Father pauses for a moment to take stock. \nFATHER To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse. \nSZPILMAN How will we sleep? \nMOTHER I'll sleep with the girls in the kitchen. You, Henrykc and Papa in here. \nHALINA (at a window) Look! Come and look! \nThey all go to the window and look out. \nTheir POV - the street. \nFurther along, men are building a wall across the street. \nEXT. GHETTO WALL - DAY \nA SERIES OF SHOTS: \nTHE WALL. THE WALL. THE WALL. \nEXT. MARKET AREA, GHETTO - DAY \nWinter. Cold, freezing day. Slush underfoot. Great activity. People selling shoes, clothes, carpets, curtains, food. A woman offers cakes under a barbed-wire cover. Noise, bustle, restless wing and froing. \nAmong the traders, Henryk, slightly shabbier now, and at his feet a basket with books. He holds a couple of volumes in his hands, trying to interest passers-by. \nSzpilman, also a little shabbier, wends his way through the setters and buyers, the beggars, the passers-by, and reaches Henryk. \nHenryk drops the two volumes into the basket, takes a handle one side of the basket, Szpilman the other. They set off. \nAs they walk, carrying the basket between them, passing beggars and children asking for food: \nSZPILMAN You sell anything? \nHENRYK Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys. \nSZPILMAN That's better than yesterday. \nHENRYK Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions. \nSZPILMAN I know. \nHENRYK You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn. \nSuddenly, a WOMAN appears in front of them, barring their way. She's brightly rouged with thickly painted eyebrows, dressed in an old green velvet curtain with an unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat. \nTHE FEATHER WOMAN Excuse me, but have you by any chance seen my husband Izaak Szerman? \nSZPILMAN I'm afraid not. \nTHE FEATHER WOMAN A tall handsome man with a little grey beard? \nThey shake their heads. \nTHE FEATHER WOMAN No? (she is near to tears, then smiles artificially.) Oh, do forgive me. (as she goes) Goodbye, sleep well, if you see him, please do write, Izaak Szerman's his name... \nShe wanders on. Szpilman and Henryk, too, continue on their way. And as they go: \nHENRYK Sometimes I wish I could go mad. \nEXT. CHLODNA STREET - DAY \nA stream of cars and trams. Jewish policemen and German soldiers much in evidence. \nSzpilman and Henryk join a large crowd of Jews waiting at a barrier to cross the intersection. The crowd is agitated, impatient for a policeman to stop the traffic and let them through. \nA MAN next to Szpilman and Henryk is becoming more and more distraught, shifting his weight from foot to foot, taking off and putting on his hat. \nTHE NERVOUS MAN This is totally insane; why do we have to have a gentile street running through our area? Can't they go around? \nHENRYK Don't worry about it, they're about to build a bridge, haven't you heard? \nTHE NERVOUS MAN A bridge, a schmidge, and the Germans claim to be intelligent. You know what I think?  I think they're totally stupid. I've got a family to feed and I spend half my time here waiting for them to let us through. \nMeanwhile, a street band begins to play a waltz. Jewish policemen and German soldiers are clearing a space, shoving Jews out of the way, including Szpilman, Henryk and the nervous man. Other soldiers are clearing a space. \nBenek points to the customer, who makes an imploring gesture to Szpilman. Szpilman stops playing. \nThe friend watches the customer intently as he drops the coins one by one onto the marble. He drops them, puts his ear close and listens.  Two or three he discards, but he smiles when coins make a pure tone, and he keeps them. \nSzpilman exchanges looks with a pretty whore, who makes eyes at him. \nSatisfied, the customer beams, nods his thanks to Szpilman, who resumes his piano playing. \nEXT. GHETTO STREET - DUSK \nSzpilman walking. He passes emaciated children and beggars. He steps over the corpses lying on the sidewalk. \nEXT. STREET NEAR WALL - DUSK \nThe wall runs the length of the street, dividing it in half and narrowing it. Buildings on one side, the wall on the other. \nSzpilman walks along. A piercing whistle from the Aryan side.  Szpilman stops. \nTwo women appear from a doorway, approach the wall and look up.  Two or three packages come flying over from the Aryan side. The women grab them and disappear. \nSzpilman walks on and sees a child appear through a hole at ground level. The child wriggles through then turns, pulls a package after him and runs. \nSzpilman walks on, hears a noise, looks back to see a SECOND CHILD trying to wriggle through the same hole. But he's stuck. Angry German voices from the Aryan side. \n2ND CHILD Help me! help me! \nSzpilman goes to him, pulls him with all his might but the boy is jammed in the hole. \nFrom the other side of the wall, the sound of an angry German voice and of a boot stamping violently on the boy. The boy screams in agony. \nSzpilman continues to try to pull the boy through. \nThe sound of the German voice swearing and the dull, crunching noise made by the boot smashing into the boy continues, and with every thud the boy screams in terrible pain. \nSzpilman struggles to help the boy whose screams are becoming weaker yet increasingly desperate. \nSzpilman pulls his arms and finally manages to get him through. The boy lies moaning. \nSzpilman takes the boy's face in his hands, tries to comfort him, revive him, but the boy has stopped moaning. His head lolls and his jaw sags. He is dead. Szpilman stands quickly and hurries away. \nEXT. COURTYARD AND HOUSE - EVENING \nSzpilman approaches the house through a shabby yard. \nINT. JEHUDA ZYSKIND'S ROOM - EVENING \nThe noise of a mimeograph machine. A huge, CHEERFUL MAN with a perpetual cigarette in his mouth. \nJEHUDA I always say look on the bright side. You're in the small ghetto, intellectuals, professional people, you're better off than us. Here, in the large ghetto, it's a cesspool. But you, you're living in Monte Carlo. You could say you're privileged and that, of course, goes against my principles. Nevertheless... \nHe laughs and coughs, starts looking through papers. His room is piled from floor to ceiling with old papers and stuff. Dark, shabby, run-down. \nOne of his sons, SYMCHE, is operating the mimeograph machine. The other, DOLEK, is sorting the sheets as they come off the roller.  MRS. ZYSKIND, holding a toddler, is cooking at a small stove. \nJEHUDA finds what he's been looking for, a newspaper made up of a few sheets. \nJEHUDA Ah, here. Today's news from the other side. \nSZPILMAN You're amazing, Jehuda. \nJEHUDA No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite. \nSZPILMAN So, what's the news? \nJEHUDA (scanning the paper) The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov. \nSZPILMAN I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news. \nJEHUDA Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God. \nHe beams. Szpilman leans over, takes a sheet from the mimeograph. \nSZPILMAN Jehuda, give me something to do. \nJEHUDA You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough. \nSZPILMAN But I want to help, I want to. \nSzpilman waits and watches, and then a POOR WOMAN passes, carrying a can wrapped in newspaper followed by a RAGGED OLD MAN, dragging himself along. He's shivering with cold, his shoes with holes show his purple feet. \nThe ragged old man suddenly lunges forward and tries to grab the can from the poor woman. They struggle desperately. \nPOOR WOMAN (screaming) A snatcher! Help me, a snatcher! \nThe can falls to the pavement and thick, steaming soup pours into the dirty street. \nSzpilman watches, rooted to the spot. The ragged old man stares at the can, lets out a groan, more like a whimper, and throws himself full length in the slush, licking the soup up from the pavement. The poor woman starts to howl, kicking the old man and tearing at her hair in despair. \nThen: \nRUBINSTEIN'S VOICE Boys, keep your peckers up! And girls, keep your legs crossed! \nRUBINSTEIN, a ragged, dishevelled little man, Chaplinesque, waving a stick, hopping and jumping, approaches the Germans outside the bureau. \nRUBINSTEIN Don't let 'em get you down - \nHe approaches a couple of Shupos. \nRUBINSTEIN Bandits! Crooks!  Thieves! \nHe waves his stick at them. They laugh. One of them bows low. \n1ST SHUPO Good day, Herr Rubinstein. \nRUBINSTEIN If that means good day, I'm your man, you gangsters, robbers, pirates! \n2ND SHUPO (tapping his head) Mad! \nRUBINSTEIN Ich bin meshuge, you bandit! \nAlmost in tears with laughter, they give him a cigarette and he goes on his way. \nSzpilman almost smiles, then looks again at the building. He waits. \nEXT. ALLEY AND LABOUR BUREAU, LATER - DUSK \nSun just setting. \nFrom the shelter of the alleyway, Szpilman continues to watch the entrance of the bureau. No mob any more, but people come and go - jewish policemen, shupos, a few jews. \nAlmost continuous sounds of distant shots and screams. \nThen, Heller appears at the entrance, looks this way and that and goes back inside the building. Szpilman alert. Again Heller appears in the entrance. He beckons someone inside. Henryk shuffles out. Heller shoves him into the street. Henryk stumbles, falls. \nSzpilman runs to him, helps him to his feet. \nHENRYK (immediately on the attack, furious) You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him? \nSZPILMAN You're out, aren't you? \nThey start to walk. \nHENRYK Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach? \nSZPILMAN I didn't grovel, I asked him to help. \nHENRYK What did you pay him? \nSZPILMAN Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food! \nHENRYK I can look after myself! \nSZPILMAN They were taking you away. \nHENRYK It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business? \nSZPILMAN You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad. \nHENRYK That's also my business. \nThey walk on. \nEXT. CHLODNA STREET BRIDGE - DUSK \nA wooden bridge has been constructed, linking the small ghetto to the large ghetto. Few people about, mostly beggars and children. \nFATHER (doffing his hat) Thank you. \nSCHULTZ (beaming, German accent) My pleasure. It won't help you anyway. \nEXT. CHLODNA STREET BRIDGE - DAY \nA great mass of agitated people crossing only one way: from the small ghetto to the large ghetto, carrying their belongings. A German film crew records the scene. The Szpilmans among the crowd, lugging suitcases and bundles, Henryk with a few books, Father carrying his violin case. They struggle across the bridge. \nEXT./INT. YARD AND WAREHOUSE - DAY \nA truck backing up. The tail-gate is opened to reveal a huge load of furniture, linen, clothing, mirrors, carpets, bedclothes. Three Jews inside the van start to unload the stuff, dumping it in the yard. \nOther Jews stand ready to start sorting the load, among them the Szpilman family. Shupos and Jewish policemen supervise. \nEach has their allotted task: Szpilman and Henryk sort out carpets, Father mirrors, Regina linen, Halina and Mother, clothing. \nThe sounds of trains not far off. \nThey carry the stuff into the warehouse. \nINT. WAREHOUSE - DAY \nSzpilman and the others bring their piles of things into the warehouse, which is crammed with similar objects, an Aladdin's cave. \nThe activity continuous. \nINT. SLEEPING QUARTERS, ABOVE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nsemi-darkness. A large room with an improvised partition of blankets to separate the men from the women. Three-tiered bunks. \nOn the men's side, Father is on the upper bunk, Henryk on the lower. Szpilman, stripping down to his underwear, is preparing to climb into the middle bunk. \nFATHER At least we've got work in the ghetto. At least we're still together. \nSzpilman nods, climbs into his bunk, settles down. Somewhere near, the sound of a train. \nThen a volley of shots, German voices shouting. \nSzpilman slips off his bunk, hurries to the door, opens it and comes face to face with a German NCO and soldiers. \nNCO Out! Assemble in the yard! \nSZPILMAN We're employed here, we've got certificates - \nThe NCO cracks Szpilman across the face, turns and goes. \nSzpilman retreats into the room, his nose bleeding. The women are watching from behind the blankets, but Mother hurries towards Szpilman. She wipes his nose. \nShots, shouts, a scream. \nEXT. WAREHOUSE YARD - DAWN \nStill quite dark. The Szpilmans and about twenty others lined up under lights shining on them from a couple of German vehicles. \nThe NCO goes along the line, making a selection, using his pistol to prod people into moving. When he gets to the Szpilmans he selects Henryk and Halina. Then, he turns to those who are left: \nNCO The rest of you get dressed then report back here. Bring your belongings. Fifteen kilos only. \nA YOUNG WOMAN Where are you taking us? \nThe NCO turns his pistol on the young woman and shoots her through the head. He marches off while she lies on the ground with blood spurting out of her. \nINT. SZPILMAN ROOMS, WAREHOUSE - DAWN \nThe partition has been pulled aside. People, including the Szpilmans, are dressing or dressed, packing up their belongings. \nSZPILMAN I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all. \nMOTHER Stop it, Wladek. \nREGINA Let's just hope that Henryk and Halina will be better off - \nSounds of shots, screams, shouts, a piercing whistle. \nEXT. STREET LEADING TO UMSCHLAGPLATZ - MORNING \nHot, fine summer's day. Jews, among them Szpilman, Mother, Regina and father, clutching their meagre belongings, walk towards wooden gates and come to a halt. Jewish policemen approach and order the people about, pushing and shoving them into line. \nFATHER Dr. Ehrlich, what do you want me to do? You want me to fight? \nGRUN To fight you need organisation, plans, guns! \nFATHER He's right. What d'you think I can do? Fight them with my violin bow? \nGRUN The Germans would never squander a huge labour force like this. They're sending us to a labour camp. \nDR. EHRLICH Oh, sure. Look at that cripple, look at those old people, the children, they're going to work? Look at Mr Szpilman here, he's going to carry iron girders on his back? \nA loud cry from Mother. Szpilman and Father spin round. \nMOTHER Henryk! \nREGINA (glancing up, shocked) Oh my God! \nNear the gates, among a large bunch of new arrivals, Henryk and Halina. \nMOTHER Halina! Henryk! \nRegina and Szpilman also call and wave. Henryk and Halina struggle through to them. Halina falls into Mother's arms and they hug. \nHALINA We heard you were here...we...didn't want...we...we wanted to be with you. \nMother comforts her. And so does Regina. Father smiles sadly. \nSZPILMAN (shakes his head, almost to himself, a forlorn smile) Stupid, stupid! \nTHE YOUNG WOMAN Why did I do it? Why did I do it? \nSzpilman stands and stares at her. \nLater: \nThe sun lower but the heat still intense. \nThe place is now packed to suffocation. People calling out names, trying to find each other. The wailing of women and the cries of children. \nA cordon of Jewish policemen and SS guards are, almost surreptitiously, ringing the compound. \nThe Szpilmans sit in the same place, with Henryk sitting a little apart and now reading a small book. \nTHE YOUNG WOMAN Why did I do it? Why did I do it? \nHALINA She's getting on my nerves. What did she do, for God's sake? \nGrun leans across to her. \nGRUN (quietly, to Halina) She smothered her baby. \nHalina looks at him in disbelief. \nGRUN They'd prepared a hiding place and so, of course, they went there. But the baby cried just as the police came. She smothered the cries with her hands. The baby died. A policeman heard the death rattle. He found where they were hiding. \nLater: \nSzpilman and Henryk. \nSZPILMAN What are you reading? \nHENRYK (a crooked, ironic smile) 'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?' \nSzpilman takes the book and reads the title page: THE MERCHANT OF VENICE BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE. \nSZPILMAN Very appropriate. \nHENRYK (taking the book back and resuming his reading) Yes, that's why I brought it. \nLater: \nThe Szpilmans seated on the kerb. Their attention is caught by a BOY who has a box of sweets on a string round his neck. And he's setting the sweets, pocketing money. \nHENRYK Idiot. What's he think he's going to do with the money? \nFather calls to the Sweet Boy and beckons him over. \nFATHER How much for a caramel? \nBrief silence. \nMAJOREK They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared. \nSZPILMAN If you need help... \nWhistle blows. \nA little later: \nSzpilman again mounting the ramp with a hod full of bricks on his back. The noise of airplanes overhead. \nEXT. SKY - DAY \nA swarm of Russian bombers. Anti-aircraft fire. Puffs of exploding shells. \nEXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY \nThe workers look up. So does Szpilman and, as he does so, the bricks slide off his hod, crashing to the ground below. \nZICK-ZACK You! \nAn SS man, ZICK-ZACK (his nickname), with a whip, approaches Szpilman. \nZICK-ZACK Here! \nSzpilman goes to him. Enraged, Zick-Zack grabs him by the hair and presses his head hard between his thighs and then beats him mercilessly. \nZICK-ZACK (with every stroke, hissing through clenched teeth) Und-zick! Und-zack! Und-zick! Und- zack! \nAfter a dozen or so strokes, Szpilman falls forward and lies in the dirt. Zick-Zack nods, satisfied. \nZICK-ZACK Get him away from here. \nTwo Poles, without armbands, one of them Bartczak, drag him away. \nBartczak and the other man help Szpilman to his feet. \nBARTCZAK Hope you played the piano better than you carry bricks. \nPOLISH WORKMAN He won't last long if he goes on like this. \nBARTCZAK I'll see if I can get him something better. \nINT./EXT. STORES AND BUILDING SITE - DAY \nWinter. Rain. Cold. The store, a wooden hut, contains wood, nails, tools, paint, metal brackets. \nSzpilman sits at a table, where a line of workers has formed. Szpilman makes a record in a ledger of the tools each worker takes out on the site. \nA worker puts his head into the store. \nWORKER (hissing) Trouble. \nA GERMAN VOICE Assemble! Fall in! Only the Jews! Poles go on working! Only the Jews! Poles go on working! \nThe Jewish workers start to assemble on the site in haphazard ranks as an SS Captain strides in. \nThe SS Captain, with much jollity and jokes, hops up on to scaffolding and stands, beaming broadly, surveying the workers. \nSS CAPTAIN (in English) I have important and good news for you. There are rumours circulating that resettlement measures are again going to be taken. \nA glance between Szpilman and Majorek. \nSS CAPTAIN (in English) I want to assure you personally that no such measures will be taken now or in the future. Posters will be going up also to this effect. As proof of our good will, we want you to select a delegate, who will be permitted to go into town once a day to buy, on each worker's behalf, five kilos of potatoes and one loaf of bread, which you will be allowed to take back into the ghetto. Now, why would we do that j if we meant to resettle you? \nHe beams; no reaction from the workers. \nSS CAPTAIN (in English) You can do good business on what you don't eat. Isn't that what you Jews are best at? Making 'geld'? \nRubs thumb and forefinger and leers; still no reaction; his smile vanishes. \nSS CAPTAIN (in English) Carry on. \nEXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY \nSnow. Majorek pulls a barrow by a rope attached to its shaft across the site. On the barrow, five sacks. The Jewish workers are phased to see him. \nGEBCZYNSKI It's not going to be very comfortable. \nSZPILMAN I'll be fine. \nGEBCZYNSKI You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon. \nHe helps Szpilman into the compartment. \nGEBCZYNSKI We've got a flat for you. Near the ghetto wall. But it's safe. \nHe hands over the cushion and the blanket to Szpilman; then, putting his back to the shelves and his feet against the wall, he pushes the shelves back into place so that Szpilman is now hidden. \nINT. SECRET COMPARTMENT - NIGHT \nIn the cramped space, Szpilman is not quite able to stretch full out. With difficulty, he puts the cushion behind his head, starts to cover himself with the blanket but stops, seeing something. \nIn niches, neatly stacked: rifles, pistols, grenades, ammunition \nSzpilman stares, expressionless. \nEXT. TRAM STOP, WARSAW STREET - AFTERNOON \nSzpilman and Gebczynski wait with others at the stop as the tram trundles towards them and comes to a halt. \nAs they board: \nGEBCZYNSKI (quietly, to Szpilman) Go as near to the front as possible, to the German section. \nINT. TRAM (TRAVELLING) - AFTERNOON \nGebczynski and Szpilman apprehensive, push through the rear section, packed with Poles, seated and standing, until they reach a chain and a sign: \nGERMANS ONLY \nIn the German section, only three or four passengers. Some read newspapers, others stare into space or out of the windows, but never looking at the Poles. \nSzpilman tries to appear as inconspicuous as possible. The tram rumbles on its way. \nINT. 1ST APARTMENT, 4TH FLOOR LANDING AND DOOR - AFTERNOON \nGebczynski and Szpilman come up the stairs to the landing and to a door. Gebczynski unlocks the door and they go in. \nINT./EXT. 1ST APARTMENT, 4TH FLOOR, AND GHETTO - AFTERNOON \nA charmingly furnished bed-sitting room with a comfortable divan. Gebczynski leads the way in. Szpilman glances around, goes to the window, looks out. \nSZPILMAN'S POV: \nHe can see a section of ghetto wall below. Beyond it, inside the ghetto, a narrow street leading to deserted buildings. Gebczynski comes up behind him. \nGEBCZYNSKI Must feel better this side of the wall. \nSZPILMAN Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on. \nGEBCZYNSKI Here. \nHe leads Szpilman to the small kitchen. \nGebczynski opens a cupboard to reveal potatoes, bread. \nGEBCZYNSKI I'll come again. And Janina Bogucki will visit twice a week. Bring more food. See how you are. \nHe closes the cupboard. \nTHE MAIN ROOM. \nGebczynski makes for the front door, stops. \nGEBCZYNSKI Yes, now, this is very important. In case of emergency, I mean emergency, go to this address. \nHe hands over a scrap of paper, shakes Szpilman's hand and goes quickly. \nAlone, Szpilman stands, lost for a moment. Then, he takes off his shoe and stuffs the scrap of paper into it. While he does so, his eyes light on the divan bed. \nHe goes to it, slips off his other shoe and lies down, testing the divan's springiness with his whole body. \nHe smiles beatifically. He shuts his eyes and is instantly asleep. \nThe building begins to burn. Flames and smoke. \nGerman soldiers with flame-throwers advance carefully then unleash their fire into doorways and windows, and quickly retreat. \nAt ground level, Jewish fighters try to fight their way out and are mowed down. \nThe fire spreads quickly through the building. Smoke begins to pour from the upper floors. \nThe Germans, less cautious now, stand and watch. \nA woman struggles out on to her narrow third-floor balcony. She climbs over, holds on to the wrought-iron railings and hangs on for dear life. Shots ring out and she drops like a stone. \nFrom inside the building, screams and shouts. \nFrom another upper window, a man in flames jumps and falls to his death on the pavement below. \nThe Germans have stopped firing. They stand, spectators, watching the building burn. \nINT./EXT.  1ST APARTMENT - LATER - DAY \nSzpilman at the window, watching, his mood downcast. \nThe noise of a key in the door. \nHe turns to see the door of the flat open. Janina enters with a parcel of food. She kisses Szpilman on the cheek. \nJANINA wanted to come earlier but... \nShe hands him the parcel. \nSZPILMAN Thank you. \nHe goes into the small kitchen and unpacks the contents while Janina gazes out of the window. \nJANINA No one thought they'd hold out so long. \nSZPILMAN should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them. \nJANINA (turning to him) Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight. \nSZPILMAN Yes, so did the Germans. \nJANINA They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought? \nSZPILMAN Yes, but what good did it do? \nJANINA (passionate) What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see. \nshe turns to look again out of the window. \nEXT. INSIDE THE GHETTO - EVENING \nThe building burning. Corpses lie scattered on the pavement. The Germans stand about chatting and laughing. \nA handful of Jewish fighters are lined up and shot. \nSatisfied, the Commander returns to his car. Another officer confers with him before the engine starts up and he is driven away. The building burns. \nEXT. 1ST APARTMENT, SZPILMAN'S POV - DAY \nBlazing sun. The ghetto buildings now burned-out shells, the street empty. \nEXT. 1ST APARTMENT - SZPILMAN'S POV - DAY \nAutumn leaves falling and gusting in the wind. Szpilman gazes out. \nEXT./INT.  1ST APARTMENT - DAY \nSnow. Ice on the windows. \nThe sound of the key in the door. \nSzpilman turns as the door opens and Gebczynski enters, distraught. Whispered, at speed: \nGEBCZYNSKI Get your things together, you have to leave! \nSZPILMAN What's happened? \nOn various floors, doors open, tenants put their heads out to see what's going on. \nSummoning all his strength, Szpilman makes a dash for it, pushing past Kitty. \nKITTY (screeching) He's a Jew! He's a Jew! Stop the Jew! Don't let him out! \nSzpilman clatters down the stairs, reaches the ground-floor landing. Another woman tries to bar his way but he pushes past her and out of the house. \nEXT. STREET - EVENING \nHeavy snow. Szpilman stumbles into the street and runs. He darts down a side street. \nEXT. SIDE STREET - EVENING \nSzpilman lurches into the narrow street. No one about. He stops, almost collapses, but manages to keep hold of himself. He puts on his coat and wraps the scarf round his neck. He leans up against a wall. \nHe removes a shoe and takes out the scrap of paper Gebczynski gave him. He reads it. \nEXT. NARBUTT STREET - NIGHT \nSzpilman drags himself along, trudging through snow and slush. Passers-by give him a wide berth. He tries to walk normally, with dignity, but he's weak and slips, and finds the going hard. \nHe comes to a villa. \nINT. VILLA, NARBUTT STREET - NIGHT \nHe goes to the front door, rings the bell and waits. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (from behind the door) Yes? \nSZPILMAN Mr Gebczynski sent me. \nThe door opens and Dorota stands there. She is pregnant. \nThey stand for a moment staring at each other. \nDOROTA (a whisper) Wladyslaw Szpilman. \nSZPILMAN Dorota. \nDOROTA Come in! come in! \nINT. DOROTA'S VILLA - NIGHT \nSzpilman follows Dorota into the living room. \nDOROTA Sit. \nSZPILMAN I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr-- (He checks the scrap of paper.') -- a Mr Dzikiewicz. \nDOROTA (nodding) Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband. \nSzpilman sits down slowly. \nSZPILMAN I need help. \nDOROTA He'll be back before curfew. \nSZPILMAN I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay. \nDOROTA He'll be here soon. \nAwkward silence. He gazes at her. She looks away. \nSZPILMAN How long have you been married? \nDOROTA Just over a year. \nHe nods. Brief silence. \nSZPILMAN And how's Yurek? \nDOROTA Dead. \nAgain, the awkward silence. \nSZPILMAN When's your baby due? \nMICHAL All well? \nSZPILMAN Thank you. \nMICHAL This is Antek Szalas. \nSzalas and Szpilman shake hands. \nMICHAL He's going to look after you. I've given him a second key. He'll bring you food. See that you're all right. He's with the underground, a good man. \nSzalas produces a quarter bottle of vodka, thumps the back of the bottle so that the cork flies out. He finds glasses and pours. While he does all this: \nSZALAS You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman? \nSZPILMAN No, I don't think so? \nSZALAS Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day. \nSZPILMAN Sorry, I don't remember. \nSZALAS Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often. \nMICHAL And you'll be pleased to hear the Allies are bombing Germany night after night - Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin. \nSZALAS And the Russians are really giving them hell. It's the beginning of the end. \nHe gives the others their vodka. \nMICHAL Let's hope so. I don't know when I'll see you again? \nThey clink glasses and drink. \nEXT. 2ND APARTMENT - DAY \nSummer. Trees in leaf. \nComings and goings at the Schutzpolizei building. And an ambulance draws up at the hospital, disgorging a couple of stretcher cases, who are carried inside. \nINT. 2ND APARTMENT - DAY \nvery weak and his skin yellowish, drops four beans into boiling water. \nThe Sound of the padlock being opened. \nSzpilman hurries to see the door open and Szalas enter with a small and grinning cheerfully. \nIn whispers: \nSZALAS Still alive then, are you? Here. Sausage. Bread. \nHe hands over the package. You still got that vodka? Szpilman stares at the package. \nSZPILMAN How long is this meant to last? \nSzalas shrugs, finds the vodka, pours two glasses \nSZPILMAN think I've got jaundice. \nHe unwraps the package to reveal sausage and bread. He takes a bite of sausage, chewing deliberately, slowly. \nSZALAS You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice. (chuckles.) In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up. \nSZPILMAN Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks. \nSzalas goes to the window, looks out. \nSZALAS Problems. Money. I've got to raise money to buy the food. I need things to sell, it' s not easy. \nSzpilman thinks for a moment, then takes off his wristwatch, hands it to Szalas. \nSZPILMAN Sell this. Food's more important than time. \nSzalas pockets the watch, makes for the door, stops. \nSZALAS Oh, yes. I meant to tell you. The Allies have landed in France. The Russians'll be here soon. They'll beat the shit out of the Germans. Any day now. \nHe grins, downs Szpilman's vodka, gives a mock salute and goes.  Hie padlock is locked on the other side. Szpilman enjoys his sausage. \nThe sentry is hit and falls in front of his box. \nAs if these young men have given a signal, now from all over the city comes the sound of gunfire. \nThe pedestrians have scattered except for the old man, gasping for breath, hobbling on his walking stick, who eventually manages to disappear inside a building. \nRifle and machine-gun fire from the Schutzpolizei building. \nThe firing intense. The three young Poles manoeuvre to the corner opposite the Schutzpolizei and toss grenades into the building. \nEXT. DOWN IN THE STREET - DAY \nA battle raging. \nThe Germans firing from the hospital. \nThe three young Poles have been joined by other fighters and they the Schutzpolizei building. \nGrenades thrown, machine-gun fire exchanged. \nThe sentry box blows up, splinters of wood cascading. A couple of Poles make a dash for it and enter a building opposite to the Schutzpolizei. \nEXT./INT. 2ND APARTMENT - SZPILMAN'S POV - DAY \nSzpilman watching from his window, looks in the opposite direction and sees smoke rising. \nWhen he turns back to look towards the T-junction, he sees a Panzerfaust anti-tank rocket firer poking out from a window in the next-door building but on the floor below. \nThe Panzerfaust fires. The shell hits the hospital. \nEXT. CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT \nThe city in flames. \nSound of firing becoming sporadic, less intense. Isolated explosions. \nINT. 2ND APARTMENT - NIGHT \nSzpilman, lying on the bed, staring at the ceiling. \nEXT. 2ND APARTMENT - SZPILMAN'S POV - DAY \nThe interior of the Schutzpolizei building burnt to cinders. \nAn ambulance is being loaded with patients from the hospital. \nA horse-drawn cab rounds a corner and clatters down the street. \nINT./EXT. 2ND APARTMENT - SZPILMAN'S POV - DAY \nSzpilman at the window, watching. \nThe horse-drawn cab clatters out of his sight. He is about to draw back when he sees, directly beneath him, a man and woman walking with their hands in the air. Then, a German soldier, pointing his rifle at their backs, appears. \nSuddenly, the man and woman begin to run. \nThe man turns and disappears. The woman also turns, but the German soldier drops to one knee and fires. \nThe woman clutches her stomach, drops slowly to her knees and collapses on the street in an awkward kneeling position, and that's how she remains. \nSzpilman watches, aghast. Then, he hears voices outside his door, shouts, footsteps, panic. \nTHE APARTMENT: \nHe runs to his front door and listens. \nVOICES (confused) Where? Where? Just get out! Everywhere! Get out into the street! \nMore clatter of footsteps. Then: \nA MAN'S VOICE Get out now! The Germans have surrounded the building! They're going to blow us to pieces. \nFootsteps descending stairs, more shouts, and: \nTHE MAN'S VOICE (further off) Everyone out, please! Leave your flats at once, please! \nSzpilman runs to the door, tries it but it's padlocked and he can't open the door. \nEXT. FRONT DOOR AND STREET - NIGHT \nSzpilman watches from the doorway. Then, dropping down, he crawls across the road on his stomach, threading his way through the dead bodies, now besieged by flies, and makes for the hospital opposite. \nGerman soldiers appear from around a corner. Szpilman immediately lies still, pretending to be just another corpse. Flies alight on him. When the Germans pass, he sets off again. \nINT. RUINED HOSPITAL, OPERATING THEATRE - NIGHT \nDark.  Szpilman crawls into a corner, rests. He's exhausted. \nHe tries to take stock of his surroundings. He can make out the operating table. He manages to drag himself on to it. \nHe lies there, his eyes grow heavy. He sleeps. \nEXT. RUINED HOSPITAL - DAY \nGerman soldiers dragging the corpses into a pile. \nA sergeant douses the bodies in petrol, then sets them alight. \nThe bodies burn. \nINT./EXT. RUINED HOSPITAL - SZPILMAN'S POV - DAY \nFrom a shattered window on the first floor, he looks at the burning bodies. \nTwo German soldiers wander into his eyeline. He draws back a little but watches them warily. \nThey sit just beneath him, chatting, and take out their food-tins, drink coffee and eat bread. \nINT. PASSAGE AND WARDS, RUINED HOSPITAL - DAY \nSzpilman wanders down the passage, sees into the wards, the empty beds, the broken furniture and medical equipment. \nINT. KITCHEN, RUINED HOSPITAL - DAY \nSzpilman opens cupboards, drawers, searching, but trying to be as quiet as possible. \nHe sees the refrigerator, quickly gets to it, pulls open the door. Empty. \nHe looks around and notices a red fire bucket with a spade and a box of sand next to it. The bucket is full of water, covered with an iridescent film and full of dead flies. \nHe drinks as much water as he can without swallowing the flies and, while he's doing so, he spots a couple of sacks. \nHe opens the first: potatoes. The second contains barley. \nHe tries to eat the uncooked barley but can't. \nLater: \nA fire on the floor. Szpilman holds a saucepan over it and is cooking the barley and some potatoes. He manages to scoop out a spoonful, blows to cool it, then eats. \nINT./EXT. RUINED HOSPITAL - SZPILMAN'S POV - DAY \nSzpilman at a window sees autumn leaves thick on the ground. And at the end of the street, a line of Poles, some with their hands in the air, others with hands on heads, being marched away by German soldiers. \nINT. WARD. RUINED HOSPITAL - DAY. \nSzpilman lies in bed under several layers of blankets. Ice on the windows. He hears German voices shouting commands. He sits up. \nINT./EXT. RUINED HOSPITAL, SZPILMAN'S POV - DAY \nSzpilman gets to a window and looks out. \nGerman soldiers with flame-throwers are burning the buildings opposite. \nOne soldier, with a bucket of white paint and a brush, numbers the building. \nSzpilman cranes to see them reach the end of the street, then cross over and start on the buildings on his side, working their way towards the hospital. \nHe pulls away and makes for the back of the hospital. \nINT. BACK OF RUINED HOSPITAL - DAY \nSzpilman goes to a window, jumps out. He twists his ankle. He's in pain. He crawls across the back garden and climbs over the wall. \nEXT. RUINED STREETS - DAY \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN (stern) Who the hell are you? \nSzpilman just stares at him. \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN Who are you? \nNo response. \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN What the hell are you doing? \nSZPILMAN (barely audible, in German) I was... I was trying to open this tin. \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN Where do you live? \nNo response. \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN What's your work? \nSZPILMAN I am... I was a pianist. \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN A pianist. \nHe studies Szpilman for a moment, then with a nod orders him to follow. Szpilman picks up the tin and follows. \nINT. ROOMS, RUINED VILLA - NIGHT \nSzpilman follows the German Captain through a double door, hanging off its hinges, into a room with a broken table in the centre, what once was the dining room. And then through another set of doors. The German Captain's boots echo. \nThey come into a spacious room. Faint moonlight filters through the large windows. Fallen masonry and broken glass. A couple of chairs. And a grand piano in the corner. \nThe German Captain points at the piano. \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN Play. \nSzpilman hesitates, then limps to the piano, puts down the tin, and opens the lid. He turns and drags one of the chairs over and sits. \nThe German Captain stands and watches. \nSzpilman glances surreptitiously at his hands, and then he plays Chopin. \nThe German Captain listens, expressionless. The pale moonlight shows him to be a handsome, elegant man. \nSzpilman finishes playing. \nSilence. \nSomewhere, a cat mews. Distant burst of rifle fire. \nThe German Captain stares at Szpilman. After a moment: \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN Are you hiding here? \nSzpilman nods. \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN Jew? \nLong pause. Szpilman just stares at him. \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN Where are you hiding? \nSZPILMAN (in German) In the attic. \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN Show me. \nSzpilman hesitates, takes the tin and then shuffles past the German Captain towards the door. \nINT. ATTIC AND LOFT AREA, RUINED VILLA - NIGHT \nSzpilman and the German Captain enter. \nThe German Captain takes out a flashlight, sees the ladder in place, leading up to the loft. \nSzpilman climbs the ladder, squeezes into the loft and looks down at the German Captain, who shines his light on him. \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN Have you anything to eat? \nSzpilman shows him the tin. \nSZPILMAN What about you? \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN I've got another one.  Warmer. (brief pause) What will you do when it's all over? \nSZPILMAN I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio. \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you. \nSZPILMAN Szpilman. \nTHE GERMAN CAPTAIN Szpilman. (a crooked smile) Good name for a pianist. \nEXT. STREETS NEAR RUINED VILLA - DAY \nFreezing weather. \nEmpty streets. \nThen the sound of recorded music, as a car, with a loudspeaker and a Polish national flag, comes into view, the Polish national anthem blaring out from the speaker. \nINT. LOFT - DAY \nSzpilman, wearing the German Captain's coat and under the eiderdown, hears the strange sound of the music, which he recognises. \nHe's astonished, puzzled. He comes to a decision and starts to leave. \nINT./EXT. HALL AND STREET, RUINED VILLA - DAY \nCautiously, in his German military overcoat, Szpilman trots down the staircase into the empty hall. \nHe goes to the front door, opens it a crack and cautiously goes out. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nSzpilman looks around, hearing the car loudspeaker indistinctly. \nLOUDSPEAKER VOICE ...German army! Polish soil liberated!  Official! \nHis excitement grows and he walks out into the street. \nHe sees at one end soldiers serving soup from afield kitchen to a group of people. \nOn the opposite side of the street, he sees a man and a woman who have left the field kitchen. The man carries a two-tiered canister. \nSzpilman rushes towards them, grabs hold of the man and tries to kiss him. The man, totally bewildered, tries to fight him off. The woman is terrified. \nTHE WOMAN German! German! \nShe runs, yelling, towards the field kitchen. So does the man. \nSzpilman stands and stares, then sees one of the soldiers cock his rifle and fire at him. \nSzpilman runs, the firing continuing. \nEXT. RUINS - DAY \nSzpilman bolts into the doorway of a ruined building. He peers out to see Polish soldiers beginning to surround the ruined building, firing shots, lobbing in a grenade or two. \nSZPILMAN (shouting) Stop, for God's sake, I beg you, I'm Polish! \nMore shots and another grenade explosion. \nSZPILMAN Don't shoot! I'm Polish! \nThe Polish soldiers: Two of the officers stand near the entrance, hearing Szpilman's shouts. \n1ST POLISH OFFICER He's Polish! \n2ND POLISH OFFICER (yelling) Come out with your hands up. \nSZPILMAN (obeying) Don't shoot! I'm Polish! Please, please! I'm Polish! \n1ST POLISH OFFICER Yes, he's Polish! \n2ND POLISH OFFICER (as Szpilman approaches') Why the fucking coat? \nSZPILMAN I'm cold. \n", "test1_input": "The Szpilmans gather at their open window to watch. Regina turns off the lights before joining them. They are all terrified. Their half-eaten meal still on the table behind them. \nPOV - from Szpilman apartment: the building opposite. \nThe SS men pouring into the building opposite. Sound of the jackboots on stairs. Lights go on floor by floor. \nIn an apartment directly opposite, a businessman, his wife, three young people and an old man in a wheelchair sit at their dining table. The SS men burst in, machine pistols at the ready. The family is frozen with horror, remain seated. \nThe NCO scans their faces. \nNCO (in a towering rage) Stand up! \nThe family rise to their feet fast, except for the old man in the wheelchair. The NCO bears down on him. \nNCO Stand up! \nThe old man in the wheelchair grips the arms of the chair and tries desperately to stand. But he can't. Without warning, the SS men seize the chair with the old man in it, carry him out on to the balcony. \nTHE SZPILMANS: \nMother SCREAMS, Father shrinks back, Halina comforts him and Regina comforts Mother. \nSzpilman's and Henryk 's POV - the apartment opposite: \nThe SS men throw the old man in his wheelchair over the balcony. He seems to hang in the air for a second then drops out of the chair and out of sight. But there's a terrible thud as his body hits the pavement and a clatter as the wheelchair follows him. \nTHE SZPILMANS: \nMother sobbing. The others, still horrified. \nREGINA (softly, to Mother) Be quiet, Mama, for God's sake, be quiet! \nThen sound of shots, slamming doors, screams, shouts. \nSzpilman and Henryk hurry to another window so that they can see what's going on. \nTheir POV from second window building opposite and street: \nSS Men herding a couple of dozen prisoners from the building opposite. \nPeople watching from the windows but trying not to be seen. \nThe headlights of the SS vehicle are switched on and the SS Men are forcing their prisoners to stand in the beam. \nA GERMAN VOICE Run!  Run! \nThe prisoners start to run. \nThe SS men open fire with a machine gun mounted on the vehicle. People in the building opposite begin to SCREAM. \nThe prisoners are being shot down. They are lifted into the air by the bullets, turn somersaults, fall dead. \nOne man escapes by running back in the opposite direction, out of the beam of light and is lost to sight for a moment. \nThe escaping man, a silhouette, out of the light, runs with all his strength, putting distance between himself and the SS. He starts to scale a wall. He looks as though he's getting away. \nBut there's a floodlight on the SS vehicle. It flares into light, swivels and finds the man. A volley of shots. \nThe man drops from the wall, dead. The SS men get into the vehicle and speed off, driving over the dead bodies. \nTHE SZPILMANS: \nSzpilman and Henryk stare at the scene, silent, shocked. The only sounds, the weeping of the people opposite and, nearer, Mother crying softly. \nINT. CAFE NOWOCZESNA - DAY \nSzpilman, as if in another world, playing the piano. The cafe is full of customers but the atmosphere is much more subdued than previously, the mood is sombre. \nEXT.  CAFE NOWOCZESNA - DAY \nA doorman with a cudgel beats away the beggars from the door as Halina, distraught and out of breath, runs to the cafe entrance. The doorman lets her in. \nINT. CAFE NOWACZESNA - DAY \nSzpilman snaps out of his reverie, seeing, across the heads of the customers, Halina, in a state of great anxiety, beckoning urgently. \nSzpilman quickly brings the piece to a close, stands, steps off the platform, threads his way through to Halina. She's shivering, almost unable to speak. \n", "test1_true": "HALINA (almost incoherent) Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God! \nSZPILMAN (shaking her) Calm down, what, what is it? \nHALINA They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk. \nEXT. STREETS - DAY \nSzpilman running. Streets crowded. Corpses. Szpilman, sweating, dodges and sidesteps. Then, suddenly, a woman bars his way. She's the Feather Woman, brightly rouged, with her thickly painted eyebrows, the unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat. \nTHE FEATHER WOMAN Excuse me, but have you seen my husband Izaak Szerman? \nSZPILMAN I'm afraid not. \nHe tries to dodge past but she grabs his arm. \nTHE FEATHER WOMAN He's tall, he's handsome. He has a little grey beard. If you see him, please do write, Izaak Szerman's his name, don't forget. \nSzpilman manages to free himself and runs on. \nEXT. LABOUR BUREAU BUILDING - DAY \nA mob of men in front of the building being herded this way and that by Jewish policemen. More and more captive men are brought in by the German Schutzpolizei (Shupos). The mob constantly swelling. \nSzpilman reaches the back of the crowd. \nSZPILMAN (to an elderly man nearest him) What's happening? \nTHE ELDERLY MAN They've got my grandson in there. They pick 'em up, they take 'em away. What do they do to them? I've stopped believing in God! \nSzpilman scans the mob. The Jewish policemen using batons and whips to herd the men. No sign of Henryk. Szpilman becomes alert. He's seen someone he recognises. Heller, with his red hair and Hitler moustache, wielding a baton, driving men into the building. With difficulty, Szpilman pushes his way through the mob and gets nearer to Heller. \nSZPILMAN (yelling) Yitzchak! \nHeller doesn't hear. \nSZPILMAN Yitzchak! \nHeller glances round. \nSZPILMAN Here, please! Wladek Szpilman! \nHeller shoves someone aside so that Szpilman can approach, but he continues to beat and manhandle people. \nSZPILMAN Henryk's in there. \nHELLER I haven't seen him. \nSZPILMAN Believe me, they've picked him up. \nHELLER Tough luck. \nSZPILMAN Can you help? \nHELLER Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me! \nSZPILMAN Can you help us? \nHELLER It costs. \nSZPILMAN I've no money. \nHELLER Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance.. \nSZPILMAN Yitzchak, they told me you had influence. \nHELLER Who told you? \nSZPILMAN People I know. They said you're an important man. \nHeller just glares at Szpilman and then moves away. Szpilman stands, jostled by the crowd, uncertain, forlorn. \nEXT. ALLEY AND LABOUR BUREAU, LATER - MID-AFTERNOON \nSzpilman, keeping to the shadows of the alleyway, watches the front of the building. Comings and goings. German Soldiers in evidence. The mob is smaller now. \n", "test1_id": 1053, "test2_input": "EXT. TRAIN - DAY \nThe doors of the trucks are closed. The train begins to move. Slow, laborious. From the trucks, the faint cries of the occupants. \nEXT.  STREET BY THE SIDING - DAY \nSzpilman catches his breath by a building. An SS man and Jewish policeman emerge. The Jewish policeman is servile, crawling to the German. He points to the train - \nJEWISH POLICEMAN Well, off they go for meltdown! \nThey laugh as they walk away. Szpilman turns and stumbles down the empty street. The cries from the trucks fading. He begins to weep, loud, agonised sobs, and staggers on. \nEXT.  GHETTO STREET - EVENING \nSzpilman, lost, empty, aimless, tries to catch his breath in the aftermath of his tears. \nHe wanders forlornly down the street, passing empty buildings with their doors open, windows smashed. Furniture, torn mattresses and pillows lie scattered. Feathers fly. Desolation. \nHe turns a corner. \nEXT. COURTYARD, JEHUDA'S STREET - EVENING \nSzpilman comes into the courtyard. He stops, his face blank. \nLying outside the door, the bodies of Jehuda, Mrs. Zyskind, their two sons and the toddler.  Szpilman steps across the bodies. \nINT. JEHUDA ZYSKIND'S ROOM - EVENING \nChaos. Papers, pamphlets strewn all over the place. The mimeograph smashed. \nSzpilman enters, stands, surveying the devastation. \nDistant sounds of shooting, shouts, cries. \nHe gathers up some papers in a pile, takes off his jacket and covers the pile of papers, making a pillow. He lies down on the floor. \nHe stares into the darkness, expressionless, empty. \nEXT. STREET NEAR CAFE NOWOCZESNA - DAY \nSzpilman shuffles along, comes to the cafe. No sign of life, but the door is wide open. He goes inside. \nINT. CAFE NOWOCZESNA - DAY \nA shambles. Szpilman wanders through the upturned tables, broken chairs. Stops, looks about. Nothing. \nDistant shots, automatic fire. \nHe turns and makes for the door. Then he hears an urgent hiss. He turns sharply and tries to find the source of it. He hears the hiss again. \nNow he sees, hiding under the platform, Benek, beckoning to him. Szpilman hurries over and crawls on his back until he's beside him. Benek replaces a plank and they are hidden from view. \nINT. UNDER THE PLATFORM, GHETTO CAFE - DAY \nThin slivers of light illuminate the two men on their backs in the cramped space. \nBENEK (looking at him, mystified) Why are you here, Mr. Wladek? \nSZPILMAN It's like this... I...we...all of them. \nHe can't continue. Benek nods. \nBENEK Perhaps they're lucky. The quicker the better. (Brief pause.) It isn't over yet. We'll stay here for a couple of days. Until things die down. (Another pause) I've bribed a policeman. He'll come when it's over. \nEXT.  GHETTO STREET - DAY \nIn bright sun, Szpilman and Benek march in a column, four abreast, under the command of two Jewish foremen, guarded by two German policemen. They are being marched out of the ghetto gates. \nSZPILMAN (to Benek) My God. I haven't been outside for - it must be two years. \nFELLOW WORKER (on the other side of him) Don't get over-excited. \nEXT. ZELAZNA BRAMA SQUARE - DAY \nStreet traders with baskets full of wares, fruit, vegetables, fish, tins of preserves. Women bargain with them, making purchases. Lively, colourful. Dealers in gold and currency calling monotonously. \nDEALERS Gold, buy gold! Dollars! Roubles! \n", "test2_true": "Szpilman, on top of a free-standing scaffold, Benek and the others demolishing a ghetto wall, wielding skdgehammers. They work slowly. \nA smartly dressed young couple are passing, but stop. \nThey stare. The young woman is extremely attractive and knows it. The foremen, workers and the German policemen ogle her. \nTHE YOUNG WOMAN Look - oh, do look! \nHer young man is puzzled; she points. \nTHE YOUNG WOMAN Jews! \nTHE YOUNG MAN Can't be the first time you've ever seen Jews. \nEmbarrassed, she giggles and they go. Szpilman, Benek and the others continue to work. \nThe foremen sit, sunning themselves, and the German policemen stand, deep in conversation, ignoring the workers. \nSzpilman suddenly stops work. He has seen something in the square that alerts him. \nAt the furthest stall, he sees a woman, attractive, chic, in her thirties, buying vegetables at a stall.  Her name is JANINA GODLEWSKA. \nSurreptitiously, Szpilman raises a hand, trying to catch her attention. But he's frightened of alerting the German policemen and the foremen. Benek has noticed. \nBENEK Someone you know? \nSZPILMAN Yes. \nAgain Szpilman tries, but Janina, her profile to him, doesn't see. \nBENEK A beauty. Who is she? \nSZPILMAN A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her. \nBENEK (playful) Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews. \nHe goes back to work. \nThe German policemen wander over to one of the stalls to buy fruit. The moment they do so two Jewish workers scamper across to another stall to buy bread. \nSzpilman glances across the square: Janina is still at the stall. \nHe comes to a decision. He jumps down, is about to dash towards Janina, but stops dead. \nJanina is no longer there. \nEXT. GHETTO STREET - DAY \nAs before, Szpilman and Benek march towards the ghetto gates in the demolition column, four abreast, under the command of the Jewish foremen and guarded by the two German policemen. \nSuddenly: \nYOUNG SS MAN Halt! \nThe column halts before a young SS man, wild-eyed, with his sleeves rolled up and wielding a pistol. He talks excitedly to the policemen then turns, walks along the column dividing them up: some men to the right, others, seven of them, to the left. Benek he orders to the left, Szpilman to the right. \nYoung SS man turns to those on the left. \nYOUNG SS MAN Lie down! \nTerrified, they obey. He stands over them and, one by one, shoots them. When he comes to Benek, the seventh man, his pistol runs out of ammunition. He changes the clip, shoots Benek and marches off. \nEXT. BUILDING SITE, OUTSIDE GHETTO - DAY \nSzpilman, bent almost double, carries a hod on his back piled with bricks. He is mounting a wooden ramp that runs up beside scaffolding on a small building site where an extra floor is being added to a house. There are Polish workers, too, who don't, of course, wear armbands as the Jews do. There's a wooden hut serving as a store on the site. \nHalfway up the ramp, Szpilman hears someone whistle. He stops, turns to see, at the bottom of the ramp, Majorek, smiling and giving a discreet wave. \nLater: \nSzpilman and Majorek sip gruel out of mugs. They sit apart from the others who are also taking a break. \nSZPILMAN How long have you been here? \nMAJOREK Since last night. I was pleased to see you. \n", "test2_id": 1054, "test3_input": "SS LIEUTENANT You lie to me again and I'll shoot you personally. \nHe kicks Szpilman viciously and marches away. Szpilman catches his breath, then quickly reaches into the bottom of the sack and finds a pistol and ammunition. He hides them under his clothes. \nEXT. STREET LEADING TO GHETTO - NIGHT \nFreezing cold. The Jewish workers, with their bundles of potatoes and bread, march back towards the ghetto gates escorted by the two Polish policemen. In the column, Szpilman, near the policeman with the moustache, and a little behind them, Majorek. Distant sounds of gunfire. \nMajorek falls in beside Szpilman. \nMAJOREK I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But. \nSZPILMAN You made contact? \nMAJOREK Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night. \nSudden, frantic cries from the head of the column, which comes to a stop. \nTwo SS men, blind drunk, drinking vodka from bottles, are lashing the column with whips. One of them is Zikk-Zack, . \nSZPILMAN Oh, shit! \nAs the SS men advance on Szpilman and Majorek's section, Majorek slips back to his place in the column. Szpilman hides his package inside his coat. \nZick-Zack lashes out at the workers blindly. \nZICK-ZACK Und-zick! Und-zack! \nHe takes a swig of vodka and comes face to face with Szpilman. \nZICK-ZACK (shouting\") I'll soon teach you discipline! Jew pigs! \nHe is staring directly at Szpilman with glassy eyes. Szpilman is terrified, trying as surreptitiously as possible to cover his hidden package with his hands. A moment of danger. Zick-Zack grabs Szpilman by the cottar. \nZICK-ZACK Know why we beat you? \nNo response; shaking him. \nZICK-ZACK Know why we beat you? \nSZPILMAN (tentatively, in German) No. Why? \nZICK-ZACK To celebrate New Year's Eve! \nHe and his comrade find this hilarious; recovering from his laughter. \nZICK-ZACK Now, march! Go on, march! \nThe column starts to march. .... \nZICK-ZACK And sing! (he belches.) Sing something cheerful! (laughs.) And sing it good and loud! \nA brief silence, then from the back, a solo voice starts to sing, 'Children of Warsaw will go to fight!' \nSzpilman glances back, sees that it's Majorek singing. Szpilman smiles, Majorek nods. Szpilman joins in. Now, so do the others. \nThey march on, singing lustily. \nALL WORKERS (singing) Hey, ranks unite And follow the White Eagle! Stand up and fight Our mortal enemy. Riflemen, hey! Let's give them fire and brimstone. We'll blow away The yoke of slavery. Punish and rout The rapists of our nation. We'll smash the knout To save our dignity. Soon we'll be proud Of our liberation - \nHey, take your sights! Aim sharply at the heart. Hey, load! Hey, shoot! Hey, load! Hey, shoot! Give 'em a bloody start! Hey, load! Hey, shoot! Aim sharply at the heart. \nThe column reaches the lamp posts near the ghetto gates. Szpilman his package over the wall. So does Majorek. \nINT./EXT. STORES AND BUILDING SITE - EVENING \nThe Jewish workers lined up to get their potatoes and bread. Szpilman and two others weigh the potatoes. \nGERMAN VOICES Get on with it and fall in! Fall in! \nCalmly, Szpilman leaves the table with the scales, walks past Majorek and the others, who, having got their potatoes, are assembling in a column, preparing to march back into the ghetto. The Polish workers have packed up their tools and are talking among themselves, also about to leave the site but in a casual way. \nThe SS guards shout orders for the Jewish column to move off. Szpilman seems as if he's going to join them, but at the last moment turns and falls in with the Polish workers, beside Barczak, who just glances at him then moves so that Szpilman is in the middle of the group. \nSzpilman slips off his armband, stuffs it into his pocket. \nThe group walk into the darkness. \n", "test3_true": "Dimly lit. Empty street. Szpilman walks fast to the corner, stops, looks round anxiously. Nothing. He takes the armband from his pocket and drops it through the grating of a drain in the gutter just as there's movement in a darkened doorway. Szpilman tenses. \nThen, out of the darkness of the doorway, a woman: JANINA GODLEWSKA. \nShe turns and starts to walk quickly. Szpilman, putting the collar of his coat up, follows, keeping pace. A pedestrian walks past in the opposite direction but pays them no attention. \nJanina and Szpilman walk on. \nEXT. BOGUCKI BUILDING - NIGHT \nJanina comes to the front door, opens it with a key, goes in. Szpilman, a little distance behind, catches up and follows her inside. \nINT. HALL, STAIRS AND 3RD FLOOR, BOGUCKI BUILDING - NIGHT \nJanina waits as Szpilman closes the front door, then starts up the stairs. Szpilman follows. She stops, turns to him, smiles, kisses him on the cheek, then continues up the stairs. \nINT. BOGUCKI APARTMENT - NIGHT \nANDRZEJ BOGUCKI, a handsome man, fortyish, tries to conceal his sense of shock at seeing Szpilman He holds out his hand and Szpilman shakes it. \nSzpilman looks around the nicely furnished, large apartment. He looks at Bogucki and Janina. Tears well up in his eyes. He fights it hard, not to cry. So does Janina. \nBOGUCKI We haven't much time. \nINT. SMALL BATHROOM, BOGUCKI APARTMENT - NIGHT \nSzpilman lies in a steaming bath, eyes closed, as though he's in a trance. \nA gentle knock on the door and Bogucki slips in with some clothes. He gazes at Szpilman, whose eyes remain closed. \nBOGUCKI You must hurry. \nBogucki holds up a towel. Szpilman lifts himself out of the bath and dries himself. \nBOGUCKI We're going to have to keep moving you. The Germans are hunting down indiscriminately now. Jews, non- Jews, anybody, everybody. (handing him the clothes') See if these fit. And, Wladek, you'd better shave. Use my razor. In the cabinet. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, BOGUCKI APARTMENT - LATER \nThe ceramic stove. Szpilman's ghetto clothes, torn into strips, are being stuffed into it and burned. Janina shoves the strips of clothes into the stove. Szpilman, now wearing Bogucki's suit and clean-shaven, watches the clothes burn while he spoons hot soup into his mouth. \nSZPILMAN Thank you, I don't. \nBOGUCKI You'll be looked after by Mr Gebczynski. He's on the other side of town. You'll stay there tonight. Then we'll find you somewhere else. \nJanina adds the last strip of clothing. \nJANINA I'll bring you food. \nBOGUCKI Let's go. \nEXT. WARSAW STREETS - NIGHT \nA rickshaw carrying Szpilman and Bogucki travels along the dark streets. \nEXT. GEBCZYNSKI'S STORE - NIGHT \nThe rickshaw comes to a halt outside a store. The moment it stops the shutters of the store are raised and Bogucki escorts Szpilman to the door, then quickly returns to the rickshaw, which moves off fast. \nINT. GEBCZYNSKI'S STORE - NIGHT \nGEBCZNYSKI shakes hands with Szpilman, ushers him in and then pulls down the shutter. \nGebczynski's store is for sanitary furnishings and supplies: lavatories, basins, baths, taps etc. \nGEBCZYNSKI I'll show you where you're going to sleep. \nHe leads the way and as he goes he picks up a cushion from a chair and a blanket. Szpilman follows. \nSTAIRS TO BASEMENT: \nGebczynski leads Szpilman down the stairs. \nBASEMENT STORE ROOM: \nDark, shadowy. Shelves with taps, washers, pipes. Gebczynski leads the may to a particular set of shelves. He puts aside the cushion and blanket, then starts to push at the shelves. Szpilman, although puzzled, helps. Slowly, the shelves move to reveal a secret compartment. \n", "test3_id": 1055}

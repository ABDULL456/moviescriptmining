{"test1_input": "Brief silence. \nMAJOREK They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared. \nSZPILMAN If you need help... \nWhistle blows. \nA little later: \nSzpilman again mounting the ramp with a hod full of bricks on his back. The noise of airplanes overhead. \nEXT. SKY - DAY \nA swarm of Russian bombers. Anti-aircraft fire. Puffs of exploding shells. \nEXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY \nThe workers look up. So does Szpilman and, as he does so, the bricks slide off his hod, crashing to the ground below. \nZICK-ZACK You! \nAn SS man, ZICK-ZACK (his nickname), with a whip, approaches Szpilman. \nZICK-ZACK Here! \nSzpilman goes to him. Enraged, Zick-Zack grabs him by the hair and presses his head hard between his thighs and then beats him mercilessly. \nZICK-ZACK (with every stroke, hissing through clenched teeth) Und-zick! Und-zack! Und-zick! Und- zack! \nAfter a dozen or so strokes, Szpilman falls forward and lies in the dirt. Zick-Zack nods, satisfied. \nZICK-ZACK Get him away from here. \nTwo Poles, without armbands, one of them Bartczak, drag him away. \nBartczak and the other man help Szpilman to his feet. \nBARTCZAK Hope you played the piano better than you carry bricks. \nPOLISH WORKMAN He won't last long if he goes on like this. \nBARTCZAK I'll see if I can get him something better. \nINT./EXT. STORES AND BUILDING SITE - DAY \nWinter. Rain. Cold. The store, a wooden hut, contains wood, nails, tools, paint, metal brackets. \nSzpilman sits at a table, where a line of workers has formed. Szpilman makes a record in a ledger of the tools each worker takes out on the site. \nA worker puts his head into the store. \nWORKER (hissing) Trouble. \nA GERMAN VOICE Assemble! Fall in! Only the Jews! Poles go on working! Only the Jews! Poles go on working! \nThe Jewish workers start to assemble on the site in haphazard ranks as an SS Captain strides in. \nThe SS Captain, with much jollity and jokes, hops up on to scaffolding and stands, beaming broadly, surveying the workers. \nSS CAPTAIN (in English) I have important and good news for you. There are rumours circulating that resettlement measures are again going to be taken. \nA glance between Szpilman and Majorek. \nSS CAPTAIN (in English) I want to assure you personally that no such measures will be taken now or in the future. Posters will be going up also to this effect. As proof of our good will, we want you to select a delegate, who will be permitted to go into town once a day to buy, on each worker's behalf, five kilos of potatoes and one loaf of bread, which you will be allowed to take back into the ghetto. Now, why would we do that j if we meant to resettle you? \nHe beams; no reaction from the workers. \nSS CAPTAIN (in English) You can do good business on what you don't eat. Isn't that what you Jews are best at? Making 'geld'? \nRubs thumb and forefinger and leers; still no reaction; his smile vanishes. \nSS CAPTAIN (in English) Carry on. \nEXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY \nSnow. Majorek pulls a barrow by a rope attached to its shaft across the site. On the barrow, five sacks. The Jewish workers are phased to see him. \n", "test1_true": "MAJOREK (under his breath) The smaller one. At the bottom. \nSzpilman nods and starts unloading the sacks as Majorek moves away. \nINT.  STORES - DAY \nSzpilman has unpacked the sacks and laid them in the corner. He kneels before the smallest of the sacks and unties the string around its neck. \nHe puts his hand inside the sack and potatoes tumble out. He reaches to the bottom and is still as his hand finds something. Carefully, he removes a pistol, then another, both wrapped in oil cloths. He hides them under his jacket. \nINT./EXT.  STORES AND BUILDING SITE - NIGHT \nSzpilman and a Jewish worker distribute the potatoes to the other Jewish workers lined up with empty containers of various kinds. There are scales on the table, and they weigh out five kilos of potatoes, pour them into the men's containers and drop in a loaf of bread. \nEXT. STREET LEADING TO GHETTO - NIGHT \nThe Jewish workers, all carrying their parcels of potatoes and bread, march back towards the ghetto gates escorted by two Polish policemen. Szpilman walks beside them. Ahead of him, Majorek near the front of the column. \nAs the column nears the ghetto gates, Majorek tosses his package over the wall and when Szpilman reaches the same spot, he throws a similar package. The column marches on. \nINT. JEWISH BARRACKS - NIGHT \nA small room with several three-tiered bunk beds. The sound of men's heavy breathing and snoring. \nSzpilman lies awake, staring at the ceiling. He reaches inside his jacket, finds a scrap of paper and a pencil, writes something. \nHe slips off his bunk and crosses to another set of bunks, crouches down at the bottom one, where Majorek sleeps. \nSZPILMAN (whispered) Majorek! \nMajorek is instantly awake. \nSZPILMAN Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here. \nMAJOREK It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard. \nSZPILMAN I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends. ( (He holds out the \" piece of paper.) I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here? \nMajorek takes the paper but says nothing. He turns over and goes back to sleep. Szpilman returns to his bunk. \nINT. STORES - DAY \nSzpilman has unloaded the sacks of potatoes into the corner and is kneeling, about to untie the string on the smallest sack. A sound alerts him. He looks round. \nAn SS Lieutenant has entered the stores, sucking his finger, which is bleeding. \nSS LIEUTENANT Any fucking plaster? \nSzpilman immediately hurries to a cupboard, finds a First Aid tin, removes a plaster and gives it to the SS Lieutenant. \nSS LIEUTENANT'S VOICE (while he applies the plaster to his finger) What were you up to? \nNothing from Szpilman. \nSS LIEUTENANT'S VOICE What the fuck are those? \nHe indicates the sacks with his chin. \nSZPILMAN (in German) We're allowed to take food into the ghetto. Five kilos of potatoes and a... \nThe SS Lieutenant walks over to the sacks and kicks the smallest one. \nSS LIEUTENANT Open it. \nSZPILMAN It's only potatoes and bread. \nSS LIEUTENANT Fuck that, you're lying, I can smell it. Open it. \nSzpilman tries to untie the string, but he's too terrified and can't manage it. The SS Lieutenant shoves him out of the way, then takes from his belt a dagger and cuts the string. \nThe SS Lieutenant reaches in and withdraws a handful of long yellow beans. He glowers at Szpilman, reaches in again, produces a handful of oatmeal. \nSS LIEUTENANT You're all the same. Give a Jew a little finger, he takes the whole hand. \nHe throws the oatmeal in Szpilman's face. \n", "test1_id": 1053, "test2_input": "GEBCZYNSKI It's not going to be very comfortable. \nSZPILMAN I'll be fine. \nGEBCZYNSKI You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon. \nHe helps Szpilman into the compartment. \nGEBCZYNSKI We've got a flat for you. Near the ghetto wall. But it's safe. \nHe hands over the cushion and the blanket to Szpilman; then, putting his back to the shelves and his feet against the wall, he pushes the shelves back into place so that Szpilman is now hidden. \nINT. SECRET COMPARTMENT - NIGHT \nIn the cramped space, Szpilman is not quite able to stretch full out. With difficulty, he puts the cushion behind his head, starts to cover himself with the blanket but stops, seeing something. \nIn niches, neatly stacked: rifles, pistols, grenades, ammunition \nSzpilman stares, expressionless. \nEXT. TRAM STOP, WARSAW STREET - AFTERNOON \nSzpilman and Gebczynski wait with others at the stop as the tram trundles towards them and comes to a halt. \nAs they board: \nGEBCZYNSKI (quietly, to Szpilman) Go as near to the front as possible, to the German section. \nINT. TRAM (TRAVELLING) - AFTERNOON \nGebczynski and Szpilman apprehensive, push through the rear section, packed with Poles, seated and standing, until they reach a chain and a sign: \nGERMANS ONLY \nIn the German section, only three or four passengers. Some read newspapers, others stare into space or out of the windows, but never looking at the Poles. \nSzpilman tries to appear as inconspicuous as possible. The tram rumbles on its way. \nINT. 1ST APARTMENT, 4TH FLOOR LANDING AND DOOR - AFTERNOON \nGebczynski and Szpilman come up the stairs to the landing and to a door. Gebczynski unlocks the door and they go in. \nINT./EXT. 1ST APARTMENT, 4TH FLOOR, AND GHETTO - AFTERNOON \nA charmingly furnished bed-sitting room with a comfortable divan. Gebczynski leads the way in. Szpilman glances around, goes to the window, looks out. \nSZPILMAN'S POV: \nHe can see a section of ghetto wall below. Beyond it, inside the ghetto, a narrow street leading to deserted buildings. Gebczynski comes up behind him. \nGEBCZYNSKI Must feel better this side of the wall. \nSZPILMAN Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on. \nGEBCZYNSKI Here. \nHe leads Szpilman to the small kitchen. \nGebczynski opens a cupboard to reveal potatoes, bread. \nGEBCZYNSKI I'll come again. And Janina Bogucki will visit twice a week. Bring more food. See how you are. \nHe closes the cupboard. \nTHE MAIN ROOM. \nGebczynski makes for the front door, stops. \nGEBCZYNSKI Yes, now, this is very important. In case of emergency, I mean emergency, go to this address. \nHe hands over a scrap of paper, shakes Szpilman's hand and goes quickly. \nAlone, Szpilman stands, lost for a moment. Then, he takes off his shoe and stuffs the scrap of paper into it. While he does so, his eyes light on the divan bed. \nHe goes to it, slips off his other shoe and lies down, testing the divan's springiness with his whole body. \nHe smiles beatifically. He shuts his eyes and is instantly asleep. \n", "test2_true": "Szpilman still fast asleep. Voices wake him. He opens his eyes. He's not certain where he is for a moment. \nHe hears the voices again, coming from the adjoining flat. \nIntrigued, he rises, goes closer to the watt, puts his ear against it, listens. After a brief silence: \nKITTEN'S VOICE (angry) Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot? \nPUPPYDOG'S VOICE What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean. \nKITTEN'S VOICE You know what? You treat me like dirt! \nPUPPYDOG'S VOICE I treat you like dirt because you are dirt. \nKITTEN'S VOICE Pig! \nPUPPYDOG'S VOICE Cow! \nKITTEN'S VOICE Pig! \nPUPPYDOG'S VOICE Bitch! \nKITTEN'S VOICE Dirty pig! \nPUPPYDOG'S VOICE You're a dirty pig! \nKITTEN'S VOICE Takes one to know one! Pig! \nSilence.  Szpilman is enjoying himself. \nThen the sound of a piano being played with great feeling but a lot of wrong notes. \nPUPPYDOG'S VOICE You play like an angel, Kitten. \nThe piano continues for a moment, but suddenly stops: \nKITTEN'S VOICE If I play like an angel, why don't you listen? \nPUPPYDOG'S VOICE I was listening, Kitten. \nKITTEN'S VOICE Liar, you fell asleep. Pig! \nA door slams. \nPUPPYDOG'S VOICE (wheedling) Kitten, let me in. \nSilence.  Szpilman smiles but then hears the sound of rifle shots and a huge explosion. \nHe crosses quickly to the window, looks out. \nSZPILMAN'S POV - THE GHETTO. \nDeserted. Stillness. Silence. From the ghetto smoke drifting slowly. \nINT./EXT.  1ST APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING \nSzpilman asleep on the divan. The roar of motor car and motorcycle engines. Sporadic firing. \nHe wakes, rushes to the window. \nSZPILMAN'S POV: \nA German personnel carrier, an open car carrying officers, and a motorcycle and sidecar roar down the narrow street below towards the buildings at the far end. German soldiers follow behind on the trot, pulling a field gun. \nUnseen marksmen fire down on the Germans from the buildings. As the German soldiers dismount from their vehicles one of them is hit and falls. The others rush for cover. \nEXT. INSIDE THE GHETTO - MINUTES LATER - EARLY MORNING \nThe German Commander and two officers alight from the car and take cover. \nThe Commander orders the field gun to be trained on the buildings. Spasmodic firing continues. \nHe gives the order to fire. \nThe gun roars. The shell tears into the building. At once the German soldiers open fire with their rifles and lob grenades into the building. The gun fires again. \n", "test2_id": 1054, "test3_input": "MICHAL All well? \nSZPILMAN Thank you. \nMICHAL This is Antek Szalas. \nSzalas and Szpilman shake hands. \nMICHAL He's going to look after you. I've given him a second key. He'll bring you food. See that you're all right. He's with the underground, a good man. \nSzalas produces a quarter bottle of vodka, thumps the back of the bottle so that the cork flies out. He finds glasses and pours. While he does all this: \nSZALAS You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman? \nSZPILMAN No, I don't think so? \nSZALAS Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day. \nSZPILMAN Sorry, I don't remember. \nSZALAS Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often. \nMICHAL And you'll be pleased to hear the Allies are bombing Germany night after night - Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin. \nSZALAS And the Russians are really giving them hell. It's the beginning of the end. \nHe gives the others their vodka. \nMICHAL Let's hope so. I don't know when I'll see you again? \nThey clink glasses and drink. \nEXT. 2ND APARTMENT - DAY \nSummer. Trees in leaf. \nComings and goings at the Schutzpolizei building. And an ambulance draws up at the hospital, disgorging a couple of stretcher cases, who are carried inside. \nINT. 2ND APARTMENT - DAY \nvery weak and his skin yellowish, drops four beans into boiling water. \nThe Sound of the padlock being opened. \nSzpilman hurries to see the door open and Szalas enter with a small and grinning cheerfully. \nIn whispers: \nSZALAS Still alive then, are you? Here. Sausage. Bread. \nHe hands over the package. You still got that vodka? Szpilman stares at the package. \nSZPILMAN How long is this meant to last? \nSzalas shrugs, finds the vodka, pours two glasses \nSZPILMAN think I've got jaundice. \nHe unwraps the package to reveal sausage and bread. He takes a bite of sausage, chewing deliberately, slowly. \nSZALAS You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice. (chuckles.) In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up. \nSZPILMAN Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks. \nSzalas goes to the window, looks out. \nSZALAS Problems. Money. I've got to raise money to buy the food. I need things to sell, it' s not easy. \nSzpilman thinks for a moment, then takes off his wristwatch, hands it to Szalas. \nSZPILMAN Sell this. Food's more important than time. \nSzalas pockets the watch, makes for the door, stops. \nSZALAS Oh, yes. I meant to tell you. The Allies have landed in France. The Russians'll be here soon. They'll beat the shit out of the Germans. Any day now. \nHe grins, downs Szpilman's vodka, gives a mock salute and goes.  Hie padlock is locked on the other side. Szpilman enjoys his sausage. \n", "test3_true": "Sunshine floods in through the windows. \nSzpilman lies inert on the bed, weak, starving, ill. \nThe sound of the padlock. He doesn't stir. \nDorota, no longer pregnant, and Michal enter, come to the bed. \nIn whispers: \nDOROTA Wladek? Wladek! (to Michal) I knew it, I knew this would happen! \nSzpilman barely has strength to open his eyes and focus on them. He mutters incoherently. \nDOROTA I'm going to get a doctor. \nMICHAL You can't, it's too dangerous. \nDOROTA I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him. \nMICHAL Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician. \nDOROTA He's still a doctor. \nShe starts for the door. \nMICHAL No, you stay, I'll go. \nHe leaves. The padlock sound. \nDorota goes to the kitchen, wets a towel, comes back to the bed, kneels it, places the towel on Szpilman's brow. He focuses on her, smiles. \nDOROTA We came to say goodbye. We're going to stay with my mother in Otwock.The baby's already there. It's safer. There's talk that the uprising will begin any day now. \nSzpilman suddenly winces with pain. \nDOROTA That man Szalas should be shot. He's been collecting money on your behalf all over Warsaw. Apparently, people gave generously. So he collected a tidy sum. He told us he was visiting you daily. \nShe looks at him; barely audible. \nDOROTA Oh God! \nLater: \nSzpilman looks up at Dr Luczak, who has a stethoscope in his ears. Dorota and Michal stand behind him. \nDOCTOR Acute inflammation of the gall bladder. Liver the size of a football. But he'll live. I'll try to get hold of some levulose, but it's not easy. \nDOROTA Can you visit him again? \nDOCTOR Who knows? \nSZPILMAN Doctor, thank you. \nDOCTOR Don't speak. Rest. \nThe Doctor and Michal leave his line of vision. \nDorota moves in beside him. \nDOROTA Michal brought food. I'll prepare something now for you, then we must go. \nSzpilman tries again to say something, but he can't, just lies there, distressed. \nEXT./INT. APARTMENT - SZPILMAN'S POV - DAY \nSzpilman looking down from the fourth-floor window. Peaceful. A few pedestrians. An everyday atmosphere. \nAt the far end, at the T-junction with a main road, a tram rumbles down the street and comes to a halt, disgorging passengers on the far side and so out of sight. \nThe tram continues on its way, now revealing the few passengers who alighted '97 women, an old man with a stick. Last, three young Poles, carrying long objects wrapped in newspaper. \nOne of the men looks at his watch, glances around, then suddenly kneels and puts the package he's carrying to his shoulder. The sound of rapid firing, which makes the newspaper at the end of the packet glow to reveal the barrel of a machine gun. \nHis two companions have also put their packages to their shoulders and begin shooting, all aiming their fire at the Schutzpolizei building. \n", "test3_id": 1055}

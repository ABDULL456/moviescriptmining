PAVEMENT flies by... sun SLAMS rainbow flares into the lens... ROLLER SKATES break frame, outpacing us... 
We're cruising along with a group of YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, skating like ROBOTS through a CITY PARK... Roller-Dolly follows HOT GIRLS in DAISY DUKES, knee socks and tube tops, belly rings and tatoos in the small of their backs... ATHLETIC DUDES, shirtless, gun racks and six packs... 
They SWING THEIR ARMS mechanically, identically... synced with each other and the beat of the soundtrack... each face plastered with an absurd, exaggerated GRIN... let's FUCKING PARTY!!! 
We are in a super-saturated world... NOT virtual/animated, but absolutely real - yet the color and immediacy of it is heightened, off-kilter. 
On the GRASS, a gang of TOKYO POP PUNK ROCKERS are having a WATER BATTLE, blasting and soaking each other with big plastic WATER CANNONS like something out of SLAYERS... 
A REDHEAD, soaking wet, is FEELING UP HER OWN BREASTS, totally OBLIVIOUS to her surroundings... One of the SKATERS, out of control, PLOWS RIGHT INTO HER at full speed... The SKATER takes a ride on concrete, grinding flesh off her bare legs... she wobbles to her feet, EYES STREAMING TEARS but STILL GRINNING ecstatically... 
A guy in a PRIEST OUTFIT holding brightly colored helium balloons looks on impassively; then spots something of interest and breaks off SPRINTING FULL SPEED... 
People are DANCING - the corniest moves ever... MAKING OUT on the ground... and in the middle of it all... 
55   EXT. SOCIETY                                                     55 
CLOSE-UP: a SPARROW is pecking at a hunk of orange and yellow CANDY CORN. 
POP OUT WIDE to reveal that the BIRD is EATING OUT OF A GIRL'S HAND... 
This is ANGIE: 25, BLONDE/black roots... micro mini skirt, fishnets, boots... green-eyes, haunted, with sadness behind them; pretty - the clothes don't quite match her; it's like someone dressed her up as a hooker.... She doesn't seem to notice the little bird munching away; she stands in the middle of the PARK, looking around, lost.

She spots a GUY standing by himself near a giant sculpture. She walks over to him; the BIRD flutters away. 
The GUY is young and attractive, dressed in casual business attire. He is wearing a PLASTIC PIG SNOUT on his face, tied with an elastic band. 
GUY Hey. 
He smiles like a Driver's License photo. 
CUT TO: 
56   INT. GORGE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                            56 
CLOSE-UP of LIPS, profile - by the looks of it, an OVERWEIGHT MALE... sweat, stubble. The ROOM is DARK - lit by the AMBIENT GLOW of a VIDEO SCREEN. 
GORGE Hi. 
57   EXT. SOCIETY - DAY                                               57 
ANGIE echoes, practically overlapping. 
ANGIE Hi. 
We will continue to CUT between the two locations. 
GUY So what's your damage? 
He WINKS. 
ANGIE strikes an exaggeratedly DEMURE, FLIRTATIOUS POSE - then immediately snaps back to NEUTRALITY. 
GORGE/ANGIE You know, just hanging out. (beat) Looking to meet people. 
GUY Lucky you... 
CUT TO:

58   INT. DALE'S PLACE - CONTINUOUS                                   58 
A CLOSE-UP of LIPS to match GORGE'S, but facing the OPPOSITE DIRECTION. An extremely butch, masculine FEMALE; trace of a mustache. 
DALE You met me. 
59   EXT. SOCIETY - DAY                                               59 
GUY (echoing) You met me. 
ANGIE laughs, a beat LATE. Across the street a WOMAN has hiked up her skirt, squatted down and is TAKING A PEE on the sidewalk. 
GORGE/ANGIE I'm Nika. 
DALE/GUY I'm Dale. (looks her up and down) I like your fur. 
GORGE/ANGIE Do you want to go somewhere? 
She strikes the same FLIRTY POSE for the second time. 
DALE/GUY We are somewhere. 
He WINKS; reaches out and puts a hand on her WAIST. They start to make out like TEENAGERS at the PROM. DALE/GUY LIFTS UP HER SKIRT with one hand and SQUEEZES A BOOB with the other. 
He turns her around and presses ANGIE'S back up against the base of the sculpture, ROUGH, hands all over her/inside her; SLOBBERING down her neck and shoulders...

The guy shoves Seth aside and dives at Fogell. 
WE GO INTO VERY SLOW MOTION: 
- Helen's bottle of Goldschlager gets knocked from the bag. It VERY SLOWLY falls towards the ground. 
- Seth reaches for it, but doesn't quite grab it. 
- WE LOUDLY HEAR the bottle as it slams against the bus floor...but doesn't break! It slowly rises back up into the air and begins sailing towards the front of the bus. 
- Evan LEAPS through the air, sailing towards the precious Goldschlager with his arms extended. 
EVAN (in slo-mo voice) GOOOOOOOLDSCHLLLAAAAAAAGERRRRRRRRRR!!!!! 
- He is inches away from grabbing it, when it suddenly smashes into a pole, SHATTERING, sending little gold flakes everywhere. 
BACK TO NORMAL. 
The Homeless Guy sees the gold flakes. 
HOMELESS GUY Shit!!! Gold!!! 
He starts frantically picking up the flakes as Evan stares at the remains, shocked. Fogell walks over. 
FOGELL What the hell is going on? Where did you come from? 
BUS DRIVER (calling from front) Get the fuck off the bus or I'm calling the cops!!! 
The boys look at each other terrified, and get off the bus. 
EXT. BUS - CONTINUOUS 
Seth and Evan are looking at one another coldly as the bus pulls away. Fogell looks at some nearby street signs. 
FOGELL (ecstatic) Holy shit! We're like three blocks away! Best luck ever! 
EXT. STREET NEAR JULES' PARTY - A LITTLE LATER 
The are walking up the street as Evan puts his clothes back on right-side out. 
EXT. JULES' PARTY - MOMENTS LATER 
The guys walk up the front steps of Jules' house. They stand in front of the door. 
FOGELL Fuck yeah, guys. We made it. Together and safe. 
EVAN I can't believe Helen's bottle broke. 
FOGELL I'm sure it'll be fine. 
SETH (sarcastic) What's the difference? I thought you didn't need it anyways. I thought you were just going to tell her how you feel, you fucking pussy. 
EVAN Yeah? Well, good luck getting Jule's drunk enough to have sex with you. 
FOGELL What's wrong with you guys? 
SETH Shut up, Fogell. Never mind. Evan'll tell you next year. 
FOGELL (to Evan) You told him? 
Evan stares Fogell down. 
(CONTINUED) 117   CONTINUED:                                                       117 
SETH Told me what? 
FOGELL Well we have to tell him now. 
EVAN Fuck, Fogell! You're a god damn idiot. 
FOGELL Well, he knows something's up. 
SETH Just say it! 
EVAN Shit. (beat) Seth, me and Fogell are rooming together next year. 
FOGELL I don't even get what the big deal is, to be honest. 
EVAN I didn't tell you because- 
SETH Save that shit for later. We've got shit to do. 
Seth just goes into the house with the booze, leaving Fogell and Evan. 
FOGELL We never should have had to hide our arrangement. 
INT. JULES' HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

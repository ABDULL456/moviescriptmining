ERNESTO J. Have someone you trust watch it and tell you about it. (This DVD proves that I wasn't responsible for the accident.) Oh, and even if my father had asked me to 
harm you, I never would have... You are very important to me, Mateo... 
Ernesto speaks naturally, for the first time, Mateo takes him seriously. 
176. MATEO-HARRY HOME. INT. DAY. 2008 
Diego is watching the images of "the making of", while Mateo works out on his treadmill. At the last moment, an instant prior to being struck by the SUV, Mateo and Lena kiss inside the car. They are then distracted by a noise from the car that is about to hit them. These images have been recorded from inside a different car, which has been following them from behind, at a safe distance (Ernesto Junior's car). Mateo reaches the living room from the other end of the house, dripping with sweat. Diego has just watched the kiss and the accident. He rewinds and he pauses right at the moment when Mateo's and Lena's kiss fills the whole screen. 
MATEO Is there something new I should know about? 
DIEGO (Surprised and moved) It's a very interesting documentary... And, yes, in effect, Ernesto followed you to Lanzarote, until the last moment. 
MATEO The images are there? 
DIEGO 
Yes. 
MATEO Those of the last night? 
They take a look at the images that Ernesto taped at "El Mirador" from the outside. Through the glass of the large window we see Lena and Mateo talking. 
DIEGO Yes. He recorded you at a safe distance, while you were on you way back after dinner. The scene is lit by the light of his headlights. It's not a lot, but enough to see what happened. Not only did he not have anything to do with the accident, he saved your life. 
Mateo watches the screen of the television without being able to see it, taking in the information Diego gives him. 
DIEGO And one more e thing: When you were at the traffic circle, before the SUV crashed into to you, you and Lena kiss... 
MATEO A kiss? I don't remember it... 
DIEGO It was an ordinary kiss, just one more of the many kisses a couple gives each other, almost without thinking... 
MATEO (Pensive) The last kiss... 
DIEGO 
Yes. Even if it sounds cheesy, someone has to tell you: Lena did not die in your arms, as you dreamed, but the last sensation she experienced in this world was the taste of your mouth... 
Mateo watches without seeing the television, he gets close to the screen. With his fingertips, he caresses the surface, literally touching Lena's last kiss. Shots of Mateo's hand caressing the screen, with the image of the kiss. Shot of Diego observing the entirety of the scene, moved. A shot of everything. The appropriate kind of music accompanies the scene as it begins to fade out, bit by bit, while a sign appears: 
EPILOGUE. 
177. ON THE AVID. INT. 2008 
Luis' notebook, open on given sequences, as if Luis were present on this last moment of the definitive editing. An ashtray with a lit cigarette. The hands of the editor powering the Avid, directing the mouse through all the necessary steps until the screen fills with a block of sequences of "Girls and Suitcases," in Pina's loft. 
The images fill the entire screen of the main narration. It begins with the same sequence Diego and Mateo watched on television. Everything is the same, but it plays completely differently. The actresses are funny and fresh. The spectator does not know what the difference is, but, unconsciously, he must feel enthralled by the sequences of Pina and Chon, as if spellbound. 
178. SCENES FROM "GIRLS AND SUITCASES." PINA'S LOFT. ENTRANCE 
HALL. INT. 2008 
Pina limps (fed up) toward the door. Looks through the peephole, behind it, Chon. They are good friends, but Chon is the last person Pina wants to see right now. 
PINA (Whispers.) What a drag! (She opens, not the least bit welcoming.) Oh, it's you? 
CHON (Anxious, reproachful.) I have left you a thousand messages! 
PINA Yes. A thousand from you and none from Ivan. 
CHON (Looks at the suitcase as if it were a menacing, strange bug.) What about this suitcase! 
PINA It's Ivan's. He's leaving me. 
She notices that Pina is wearing a cast on her leg. 
CHON And that cast on your leg? 
PINA His ex-wife, the crazy one. She pushed me down the stairs... 
CHON Well, we're in good shape! I've also broken up with my husband... 
PINA Oh, sorry to hear it! I will make some coffee, I have spent my entire night looking for Ivan and I haven't gone to bed. 
CHON Neither have I. 
On her way to the kitchen Chon notices, through the bedroom door, that the bed has been burnt. She bumps into the phone that has been ripped out of its socket, now on the floor. She says nothing, she doesn't want to pry, but she thinks that Pina's situation must be more complicated than hers. 
179. LOFT'S KITCHEN. INT. 2008 
The chickens are living large, free to roam throughout the entire place. 
PINA When did you leave him? 
CHON Four days ago. I could see it coming. The thing is that after breaking up, I go out onto the street and I notice there is this "guy" looking at me. 
She also discovers the gazpacho on the kitchen table. 
CHON (Voracious.) Oh my, gazpacho! Can I have a bowl? 
PINA

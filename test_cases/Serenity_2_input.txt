THE OPERATIVE Captain Reynolds, I should tell you so that you don't waste your time: You can't make me angry. 
INARA Oh please. Spend an hour with him. Mal smiles -- then glares at Inara, mouthing "Hey!" 
THE OPERATIVE I need her, Captain. River is... my purpose and I will gather her to me. The brother as well. Whatever else happens is incidental. In the greater scheme. 
MAL Why is it that the greater scheme always makes everything not that great? 
THE OPERATIVE I want to resolve this like civilized men. I'm not threatening you. I'm unarmed. 
MAL Great! He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway. The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind. 
THE OPERATIVE I am of course wearing full body armor. I'm not a moron. He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts, but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds. Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operative kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying. Mal gets to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing hard, nose dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting. 
MAL No back up? We're making an awful ruckus... 
THE OPERATIVE They'll come when they're needed. 
MAL I'd start whistling. 
THE OPERATIVE Captain, what do you think is going to happen here? They come at each other. The Operative is the much better trained -- he's fluid, his blows sparse and deadly. 
Mal is more bluster and determination, and the operative's precision is wearing Mal down. Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick V0 to the head that sends Mal to the ground not far from Inara, breathing hard. He tries to rise again, painfully, but Inara places her hand on his arm. The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door, pulls out his sword. His face has taken on that remote kind of fascination as he looks at it. 
THE OPERATIVE 
(CONTINUING) Nothing here is what it seems. 
INARA I know. 
THE OPERATIVE He's not the plucky hero. The Alliance isn't some evil empire. This isn't the grand arena. 
INARA And that's not incense. He turns to look: the incense stick burns away -- rather like a fuse -- and FLASHES in an explosion of light and sound. 
It's a flash-bomb: The Operative sails back as everything goes smoky white and the sound dies to a tiny buzz. The Operative tries to get his bearings -- and four armored soldiers are in his face, asking him for orders... Mal and Inara are gone. He motions for the men to follow them. 
THE OPERATIVE Just a flash bomb. Go! Go! 
INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - CONTINUING 
Inara leads Mal (who is reholstering his gun) down some steps and along a corridor. The sound is still tinny and weird. 
MAL .I had him... 
INARA What? 
MAL (deafly loud) I think that I was winning! 
EXT. SIDE OF MOUNTAIN, BY MAL'S SHUTTLE - DAY 
Mal and Inara move quickly down the mountain. They look to see that Mal's shuttle has four Alliance guards waiting by V0 it. Mal ducks back out of sight, pulls a fancy-looking grenade out of his pocket. Pops the top and hurls it over at the foursome. CLOSE ON: THE GRENADE, as a series of bars of light go out one by one, counting down -- 
ALLIANCE SOLDIER Grenade! Everybody dives for cover. The moment they do, Mal and Inara race into the shuttle, Mal sweeping up the grenade just as the last light goes out and nothing happens. One soldier turns to look and Mal shoots him back down as the door shuts on him and Inara. 
INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUING 
Inara pushes into the pilot's seat. 
INARA Hang on to something. 
MAL 4 You sure you remember how it -- He nearly falls over as: 
EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUING 
The shuttle shoots straight up, spinning and heading out. 
INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUING 
Inara stares straight ahead, relaxing her grip on the controls. Mal is gone. 
INARA I told you to hang on. 
MAL (O.S. ) (in great pain) I'm fine... 
EXT. SPACE - LATER

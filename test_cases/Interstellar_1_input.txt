MURPH Try a different direction. 
As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then picks up again. Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt. 
COOPER It's a fail-safe. It's going to annoy us into taking it home. 
Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins SHRIEKING again. 
TOM What are we going to do? 
Cooper gets a rope. 
COOPER We're going to get some sleep. 
He begins tying the rope around the probe. 
INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY 
Cooper wakes. He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around his head. The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant. 
INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY 
Tom heads off for school with Donald. Murph, still suspended, looks up at Cooper, smiling. 
MURPH What are we doing today? 
COOPER You're staying here and cleaning the house. 
Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard. Cooper follows his stare. 
COOPER (CONT'D) I told you, Murph. There's no one to take it back to. 
MURPH But what if there is, dad? What if there's something we can salvage? 
Cooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes. 
EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY 
The shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well, putting in a pair of earplugs. 
A line is staked off, leading down into the well below. Cooper begins hauling the line up. 
As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK returns to its normal volume. Cooper rolls the probe out onto the ground. 
INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY 
The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along the dusty runway and into the air. 
EXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY 
The tiny plane follows the mountains south. 
EXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY 
Cooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken and burned what was left of the homes in between. 
EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY 
Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become ranchland, once again. 
EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY 
An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and checks it over. 
COOPER Got any diesel? 
OLD MAN Plenty. Shame you can't eat it. 
Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane. 
INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY 
Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat, the probe is HUMMING. 
A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island. 
As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent. 
MURPH I think it's home. 
Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat grassland in the center of the island. 
EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY 
The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass. 
Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. Cooper slings a rifle over his shoulder. 
A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line. Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with bright red -- strawberries. 
MURPH Dad, what are these things? 
COOPER I don't know. Don't touch them. 
Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a little off. He walks over. 
He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical transport truck. 
Cooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle. 
COOPER (CONT'D) Murph? 
He looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses and heads into the forest to look for him. 
EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY 
Cooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings. Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk of the tree is red hot. 
Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam. 
Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him. 
Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a clearing. 
COOPER Careful. There's some kind of underground facility here. We might... 
Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something: 
Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT. 
MURPH Is it still... alive? 
COOPER Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't made them for thirty years. I've never seen one intact before.

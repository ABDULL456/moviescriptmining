As Lincoln and his escorts move across the battlefield, grey and blue uniformed corpses and badly wounded men intermingle. 
He reaches the other side of the field, passing a Confederate flag to enter the now-ruined town of Petersburg. 
EXT. THE THOMAS WALLACE HOUSE, GRANT'S TEMPORARY HEADQUARTERS, ON MARKET STREET, PETERSBURG - MORNING 
Grant, smoking his cigar, his uniform dusty and rumpled, is sitting on the small porch. He stares piercingly at Lincoln, in a rocker next to him, watching his troops pass by as they move in to secure the conquered town. Lincoln closes his eyes. 
He has grown older, the skin around his eyes is cobwebbed with fine creases, and his hair's thinner, softer, suffused with grey. His brow has grown smoother. 
LINCOLN Once he surrenders, send his boys back to their homes, their farms, their shops. 
GRANT Yes sir, as we discussed. 
LINCOLN Liberality all around. No punishment. I don't want that. And the leaders - Jeff and the rest of `em - if they escape, leave the country while my back's turned, that wouldn't upset me none. 
When peace comes it mustn't just be hangings. 
GRANT By outward appearance, you're ten years older than you were a year ago. 
LINCOLN Some weariness has bit at my bones. (BEAT) I never seen the like of it before. What I seen today. Never seen the like of it before. 
GRANT You always knew that, what this was going to be. Intimate, and ugly. You must've needed to see it close when you decided to come down here. 
LINCOLN We've made it possible for one another to do terrible things. 
GRANT And we've won the war. Now you have to lead us out of it. 
EXT. THE MCLEAN HOUSE, APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA - AFTERNOON 
OFFICERS OF THE CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMY stand around in the afternoon sun. Everyone's solemn, even stunned by what's just happened. No one is speaking. 
TITLE: APPOMATTOX COURTHOUSE, VIRGINIA 
APRIL 9, 1865 
ROBERT E. LEE comes down the steps of the McLean house, as a CONFEDERATE OFFICER brings his horse to him. His face is blank. Lee mounts his waiting horse. 
Lee should leave, having just surrendered to Grant inside; but he's immobile. Some of the officers of both sides look at Lee, some can't bear it. Lee tries out various expressions: pride, defiance, blankness. 
Grant stomps onto the porch of the house, followed by his staff. Among them is Robert Lincoln. 
Grant, lost in thought, stops, taken aback, realizing that Lee's still there, astride his horse. Everyone looks at the two men who look awkwardly at one another. 
Then Grant removes his famous slouch hat. Everyone freezes for a moment, and then one by one, the officers of the Union Army remove their hats. 
Lee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect. He raises his hat, briefly, only an inch from his head. Then, pulling slightly on his horse's reins, he rides away. 
EXT. A BUGGY RIDE THROUGH WASHINGTON - AFTERNOON 
A beautiful spring afternoon. Lincoln and Mary are riding in the buggy, driven by the old soldier. 
MARY You've an itch to travel? 
LINCOLN I'd like that. To the West by rail. 
MARY (shaking her head no:) Overseas. 
LINCOLN The Holy Land. 
MARY (a laugh, then:) Awfully pious for a man who takes his wife out buggy-riding on Good Friday. 
LINCOLN Jerusalem. Where David and Solomon walked. I dream of walking in that ancient city. 
She seems sadder. They ride in silence. 
MARY All anyone will remember of me is I was crazy and I ruined your happiness. 
LINCOLN Anyone thinks that doesn't understand, Molly. 
She nods; then, tenderly: 
MARY When they look at you, at what it cost to live at the heart of this, they'll wonder at it. They'll wonder at you. They should. But they should also look at the wretched woman by your side, if they want to understand what this was truly like. For an ordinary person. For anyone other than you. 
Lincoln laughs, takes her hand. She leans against him.

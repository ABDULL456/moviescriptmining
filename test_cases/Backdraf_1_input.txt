Swayzak's leaning on it. We sense the dislike between them. Swayzak steps aside. Rimgale pops the trunk. 
SHADOW Awful expensive shoes to be wearing at a fireground, Alderman. But then I guess you haven't been to too many fires. 
JENNIFER I wanted to talk to you about Alan Seagrave's death. We still haven't gotten a fire report from your office. 
SHADOW You'll have an answer as soon as I do. 
SWAYZAK People are asking how a prominent taxpayer got stuffed through the windshield of his own car. They're asking me. 
JENNIFER --The point is, Investigator, you haven't even told us yet if the fire was accidental. We're starting to get the feeling your office is dragging out this case to embarrass the Alderman because of his fire dept. reorganization program -- 
SHADOW -- You mean his firehouse closing program, -- Don't you? 
JENNIFER We'd just be very disappointed if it turned out your office was playing politics. 
SWAYZAK -- Because I'm not. I care about this city, and I care about this department -- 
Rimgale cuts him off with the shutting of his trunk lid. 
SHADOW (calm of a monk) Alderman, I have a remarkably uncomplicated job. To decide if a fire's arson, and if so catch the pain in the ass doing it. But to be honest, if my methodical investigative methods just happen to muck up the campaign of certain mayor wanna-bees, well, I guess I can't say I sleep any less peacefully. 
And he walks back to the burned building. 
SWAYZAK I wish I could just fire the son of a bitch. 
STEPHEN Hey! Swayzak! 
Stephen's leaning out of an upstairs window. As the TV cameras turn, he drops down onto a fire engine hose bed and pops right into Swayzak's face with a murderous grin. 
STEPHEN We almost lost a whole company up there, Swayzee buddy. Isn't any back- up since you closed '33. And we really appreciate it, the guys and me. Honest. I know you've got my vote for mayor. 
Grindle and Santos start walking for Stephen. Brian's there, following after them. 
SWAYZAK Look Lt., I'm on your side. If there's a problem, please, work with our task force to fix it. 
STEPHEN Oh yeah, your famous task force... three guys have already died this year because of the cuts made by your "task force"... 
GRINDLE Stevie, c'mon man... 
Stephen silences Grindle with an outstretched hand. Swayzak leans close, out of earshot of the cameras. 
SWAYZAK You see that funny glow that's starting to blink in the corner of your eye, Lt? That's your career dissipation light -- and it just went into overtime. 
STEPHEN If anybody's light's gonna blink, it's yours. 
Swayzak holds his ground. It's a tense, out of control moment between them. Rimgale turns from his work, watches Stephen with concern. Adcox suddenly inserts himself face-to-face with Swayzak and we see the raw hatred. 
AXE You're in firemanland now, Swayzak. Do yourself a favor and just walk away. 
Swayzak holds Adcox's gaze, then turns for his car. Brian watches Jennifer climb in beside her boss. 
BRIAN This is your city job? 
Jennifer shrugs as they pull away. 
INT./EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - LATE DAY 
Brian jumps down from the rig as it backs up the driveway. Across the street a middle-aged woman flashes them from the balcony of her apartment. 
AXE That's Franny. She likes firemen. 
STEPHEN Tim, fill out the alarm card. (to Brian) Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose. 
Adcox watches Brian and Tim exchange looks. Tim shrugs. Brian sighs and pulls out the pike poles, starts across the floor before freezing suddenly at a murderous GROWL. Brian turns and sees a DOG. Sort of. It has the rib cage of a wild beast, fangs, long greasy hair. It blocks his way, SNARLING with hate. 
GRINDLE That's The Thing. You can't stay unless he likes you. 
Slobber drools out of its mouth as it GROWLS. 
BRIAN Have you guys got something against dalmatians? 
Brian wipes some of the crusted grime from his face, looks back and forth between Franny and The Thing, and sighs. 
INT. FIRE STATION 17 - BUNKROOM 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
INT. FIRE STATION 17 - LOCKER ROOM 
Brian enters, strips down his battered uniform, and opens his locker. The mannequin from the fire SPRINGS OUT, legs spread. A sign taped to its mouth says: "TAKE ME BRIAN, YOU'RE MY SUPERMAN!" 
INT. FIRE STATION 17 - WASHROOM 
Brian and the others scrub the morning's fire off their bodies in the station shower. Tim keeps filling his mouth full of water and launching it upward in a stream. 
BRIAN Do you have to do that? 
TIM (pumped) Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch. 
Brian compares himself to the praise heaped on Stephen.

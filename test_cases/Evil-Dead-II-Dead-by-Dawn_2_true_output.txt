We are racing forward.  We have taken the POV of an EVIL ENTITY as it glides with dark purpose through a section of woods. It approaches the rear door of the cabin.  The door is torn violently open.  The next door falls away from us.  We approach the front door. SLAM! It jigsaws in two and we are again outside, now in front of the cabin.  Ash is seen in the distance.  He is staggering away, his back to us as we race at him.  He turns suddenly towards CAMERA and screams.

The final shot of Evil Dead I has a new ending; an extension. Ash is caught by an invisible grip. "G" force is distorting Ash's face as he is rocketed backwards.  He is swept hand over foot through the air.  He reaches the edge of the woods and begins tearing through the branches and smaller trees, clearing a path with his body.  He finally slams into a large ungiving tree trunk and he is knocked unconscious.

FIONA (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are! 
ROBIN HOOD Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men. (laughs) 
Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song. 
MERRY MEN Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo. 
ROBIN HOOD I steal from the rich and give to the needy. 
MERRY MEN He takes a wee percentage, 
ROBIN HOOD But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels, man, I'm good. 
MERRY MEN What a guy, Monsieur Hood. 
ROBIN HOOD Break it down. I like an honest fight and a saucy little maid... 
MERRY MEN What he's basically saying is he likes to get... 
ROBIN HOOD Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad. 
MERRY MEN That's bad. 
ROBIN HOOD When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad. 
MERRY MEN He's mad, he's really, really mad. 
ROBIN HOOD I'll take my blade and ram it through your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 'cause I'm about to start... 
There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and knocks Robin Hood unconscious. 
FIONA Man, that was annoying! 
Shrek looks at her in admiration. 
MERRY MAN Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at Fiona but she ducks out of the way) 
The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree. 
Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is a very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down, and Fiona begins walking away. 
FIONA Uh, shall we?

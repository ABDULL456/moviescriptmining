{"train": "CAST AWAY \nCAST AWAY \nby \nWilliam Broyles \nTHIRD DRAFT \nMarch 13, 1998 \nFADE IN: \nEXT.  MARFA, TEXAS - 1993 - WIDE - DAY \nThe Texas plains, horizon to horizon, nothing but the browns and ochres of earth and the blue and violet of the sky.  The sheer scope of it sinks in:  the blank slate of nature, the absence of man.  On the screen superimpose: \nMARFA, TEXAS, 1993. \nCREDITS BEGIN. \nA plume of dust comes into frame.  The dust is from a TRUCK, orange and white and violet, with \"FedEx\" blazoned across the side. \nThe truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II era Quonset huts and outbuildings.  Around the outbuildings are large sculptures of wood and metal. \nEXT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY \nThe door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties.  Hair pulled back, casual, an artist.  She hands the DRIVER a FedEx BOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS. The Driver has a hand-held computer; a portable printer dangles from his belt. \nThe Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer, prints out a label and sticks it on the Box, ready to go. But something on the box catches her eye.  She wants it back. He glances at his watch.  She draws RINGS around the Wings, uniting them.  She gives the box to the Driver, then hands him a cup of coffee.  They've done this before. \nHe takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck.  He jumps in and heads back onto the plains. \nEXT.  FEDEX OFFICE - MIDLAND/ODESSA - NIGHT - HOURS LATER \nThe Driver jams the distinctive Angel Wing Box on top of a dolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides. A female Loader slaps a large bar code label on the container, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt of rollers onto a larger truck.  The doors of the truck close.  The latch slams down. \nA forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737. \nEXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT SUPERHUB - NIGHT \nThe 737 lands. \nEXT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER \nOne of a seemingly endless line of FedEx planes, our 737 taxis to a gate at the FedEx SUPERHUB.  The Hub is a vast living organism -- loud, complex, overwhelming, as much a symbol of modern life as was the factory in Modern Times. \nFive thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected activity inside three vast hangers brightly lit.  Hundreds of forklifts and cargo-pullers dart about, their headlights crisscrossing like a laser show. \nLoaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT. \nINT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT \nThe forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a LOADING BELT, where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of packages, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them, all shapes and sizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks.  Large mechanical arms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of stations.  The packages surge and move. \nThe Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts, where they're scanned by laser readers.  Picking up speed our Box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts. \nThe Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG. \nEXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT \nA forklift lifts the Container to a door on a giant MD-11. \nINT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT \nA jumbled room jammed with computers and dominated by a HUGE WALL GRAPHIC that charts hundreds of airplanes.  An Operator moves a yellow strip labeled Jumbo 12 across the board. \nEXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nThe giant place touches down in Paris.  The Angel Wing Box moves quickly on another belt and disappears into another CONTAINER, which is loaded onto still another AIRPLANE. \nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG AIRPORT, RUSSIA - NIGHT \nThe plane lands.  The container is unloaded down a belt.  We see our Angel Box.  Directly in front of it is a DENTED BOX. \nINT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE, RUSSIA \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nNight.  The manic activity has come to a dead stop.  Our two Boxes sit on a table in a corner not far from a small Christmas tree. \nDaylight now.  YURI, a Supervisor, saunters over, picks up the Angel Box, sees an attractive co-worker, puts it down. \nNight again.  A cat walks by the table where our two Boxes have come to rest. \nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE - DAY \nA FedEx truck pulls out of the warehouse.  The walls of the warehouse are covered with graffiti.  The streets are slushy, the buildings blanketed in snow. \nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY \nThe Driver sits in the truck drinking tea.  He takes a last sip, sighs, gets out with the Angel Box.  Walks slowly toward an APARTMENT HOUSE. \nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nA beautiful young RUSSIAN WOMAN opens the door.  A young AMERICAN MAN comes up behind her, signs the form and takes the Angel Box.  We see Christmas decorations inside.  The woman puts her arms around him as the door closes. \nRUSSIAN WOMAN (O.S.) (accented English) It's pretty.  Who is it from? \nAMERICAN MAN (O.S.) My wife. \nChuck looks at Lev with respect.  Right answer. \nCHUCK So how come the other drivers haven't left yet? \nThe Translator asks Lev, who looks at him as if he is crazy, then snorts an answer.  The Translator blushes. \nTRANSLATOR He says -- he is a very rude fellow -- \nCHUCK Tell me exactly what he said. \nTRANSLATOR He says why don't his farts smell sweet? \nChuck grins.  Lev shrugs and says something else. \nTRANSLATOR He says that's just the way it is. \nCHUCK Lev -- it's Lev, right?  Listen, this is FedEx.  We don't have to accept the way it is. \nEXT.  HOTEL - ST. PETERSBURG \nA weary Chuck enters the hotel.  In the sky above him we see the Northern Lights.  He doesn't even look up. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nChuck is watching CNN on the television, working his PowerBook, and holding the phone. \nCHUCK No, keep trying.  A circuit's bound to open up. \nHe hangs up. \nCHUCK (to himself) Those damn Northern Lights. \nJust then the lights go off.  For a moment everything is darkness.  Then a small light switches on.  Chuck has a headlamp on. \nHe gets up, heads into the bathroom.  We stay in the bedroom. After only a moment, the light reemerges.  It heads over to his bag.  We go with it. \nChuck takes out a roll of toilet paper.  The guy is prepared for anything.  He goes into the bathroom, closes the door. \nThe lights come back on just as the phone rings. \nWe hear scuffling sounds on the other side of the door. Chuck charges out, holding up his pants. \nGrabs the phone. \nCHUCK Hello?  Great.  Try it. \nHe waits.  We hear an ANSWERING MACHINE. \nKELLY (V.O.) This is Kelly, leave me a message and I'll call you back soon as I can. \nThis is not what Chuck wanted to hear. \nCHUCK Kelly, damn, look, this is Chuck.  I'm going to be a little late.  Well, more than a little.  I had to go to Russia. Couldn't be helped.  Could you call and cancel the trip?  Look, we'll sail the Keys in March.  It's better then anyway. I'll be back before Christmas.  I promise.  I think.  I mean, I will.  I, uh -- \nHe's stumbling over whether to say I love you. \nCHUCK I miss you. \nHe gently hangs up the phone. \nINT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - SERIES OF SHOTS \nA surprised Yuri stands with the attractive assistant as Chuck takes his clipboard away. \nAn even more surprised Lev stands by his truck as Chuck hands the clipboard to him. \nChuck and the loaders clean off the graffiti. \nWorking alongside the sorters as the packages come in, Chuck points out how to organize the inflow. \nChuck and Lev go over large maps of St. Petersburg with the drivers. \nINT.  FEDEX WAREHOUSE - ST. PETERSBURG - WEEK LATER \nA big semi is being loaded with outgoing packages for the airport run.  Aleksei, Chuck, Lev and the office executives watch as containers are rolled on. \nLEV We've never got all the trucks in on time.  Never. \nChucks looks at the clock. \nCHUCK Only one still left? \nLEV Route six. \nAleksei points at the big semi. \nALEKSEI If we don't send it now we may miss the connection in Paris. \nThe pressure in on.  Chuck looks around at his team. \nCHUCK (to Aleksei) Give it five minutes. \nEXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - MINUTES LATER \nThe last truck rolls in. \nINT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG \nThe last truck enters and loading dock.  A few loaders move toward it.  The executives all stand and watch.  But not Chuck.  He's hands on. \nCHUCK Let's go. \nHe heads toward the truck and begins pulling off packages. All the other executives follow him. \nEXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - NIGHT \nThe MD-11 takes off. \nINT.  MD-11 - NIGHT \nChuck is focused on his PowerBook with the screen away from us, Stan is doing tai chi amidst the FedEx containers.  It feels a little surreal, all those containers surrounding them. \nStan comes over, looks at the image on the computer.  It's a sailboat with some technical specifications under it. \nSTAN I didn't know we had sailboats. \nCHUCK It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered. \nSTAN For all those vacation days you got coming. \nChuck doesn't look up. \nCHUCK And never take. \nSTAN Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis. \nCHUCK Forget it. \nSTAN You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go. \nCHUCK I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention. \nSTAN We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice. \nCHUCK That's why you're a gambling man. \nSTAN That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am. \nCHUCK For the third time. \nSTAN Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life. \nStan is so outrageous, Chuck can't help but laugh. \nCHUCK You are one sick fucker. \nSTAN I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this -- \nCHUCK This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal. \nBut apparently it is. \nSTAN Look, that kids' bike, that's a guy who'll do what it takes to get there on time.  Live up to your legend, that's all I'm saying. \nChuck reaches in his pocket, pulls out a bill. \nCHUCK A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month. \nSTAN Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now. \nCHUCK Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not? \nSTAN We're on. \nChuck closes the PowerBook. \nCHUCK Let's go off-line. \nThey both take out their Valium -- the price they pay for being such road warriors. \nCHUCK Two Valium... \nStan puts on his Walkman. \nSTAN And the Stones.  Got to be. \nIt's their ritual.  Chuck puts headphones from his Walkman over his ears, puts a mask over his eyes and leans his head back onto the headrest.  We hear the Rolling Stones. \nEXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT - NIGHT - WIDE \nThe MD-11 arrives at its gate.  The cargo doors open. Forklifts and a gangway roll up to the side. \nINT.  MD-11 - NIGHT \nStan stands smiling over Chuck. \nSTAN Chuck.  Wake up Chuck. \nChuck pulls off the mask, takes out the earplugs.  He manages a groggy grin. \nSTAN You gotta do your own delivery from here. \nINT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT \nChuck walks through the extraordinary nexus of speeding packages that intersect in intricate paths above and around him.  This is the beating center of the FedEx world, the crossroads, the deep core where everything connects.  In his still-drugged state it all seems weirdly psychedelic.  A Christmas tree goes by, then a huge plastic Santa Claus, both with shipping labels. \nEXT.  CHICKASAW GARDENS - MEMPHIS - NIGHT \nChuck's car pulls into the driveway of a small cottage in an older Memphis neighborhood.  The radio is playing the news. \nINT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck drops his briefcase and his bag.  The place is a jumble of clothes, papers, books, etc.  In the living room is a tank of tropical fish.  The water looks a little green.  No bubbles are coming from the filter. \nUh oh. \nChuck walks to the tank.  He tightens a piece of tape that holds the power cord onto the filter, taps the filter with his finger, once, twice...the bubbles start again. \nKELLY Come on. \nINT.  KELLY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nA tiny cubicle with a door.  She closes it, takes some paper towels out of the desk, wipes his fingers. \nKELLY We're on the deck of the ketch, the air's soft, the water's clear as crystal... \nShe licks the last bit of toner off his fingers. \nCHUCK That's carcinogenic. \nShe ignores that, stays with the fantasy. \nKELLY We're covered with suntan lotion and sweat.  Our skin is so hot, it's glowing... \nAnd she comes closer to him. \nKELLY We could take a swim. \nShe's really close now. \nCHUCK On the other hand we could not take a swim... \nThey squiggle themselves onto the desk. \nINT.  LAB - NIGHT \nSomeone kicks the door shut.  Now the figures are in silhouette, lit by the light in the office. \nAnd then the light goes out. \nEXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - NEXT MORNING \nA nondescript office park near the airport.  No sign. Chuck's car screeches into the parking lot.  He jumps out, glances at this watch, and heads for the building at a run. \nINT.  EXECUTIVE CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nA large room dominated by an animated MAP OF THE WORLD. Lights at various locations blink and flash.  Above the map are a large Sign saying \"Here Today, Gone Tomorrow\" and two huge digital Clocks -- one keeping time, the other a countdown clock for that day's package sort at the SuperHub. \nThe operations team of FedEx sits around a large table.  Each has on a headset.  BECCA TWIGG, the business-like senior vice president of Operations, addresses questions to a man -- COLIN PARKER-BOWLES, the European operations manager -- on a LARGE TV SCREEN in front of her.  \"London\" is superimposed on the screen. \nBECCA So why was Milan late, Colin? \nCOLIN One of the race horses coming from Ireland got colic and had to be off- loaded in Brussels.  That put the Jumbo 15, six hours late into Charles De Gaulle.  Customs had difficulty locating the dutiable items... \nColin continues as Chuck, out of breath, slips under the screen and heads for the one remaining vacant seat -- across from Stan.  Next to Stan is MAYNARD GRAHAM, an MBA systems man.  Becca addresses a question over to Stan. \nBECCA Stan, can we get P&A down to work with Milan customs? \nSTAN We're already on it. \nBECCA Good.  And let's look at our live animal policy.  I don't think the income stream justifies delaying IP product, especially at Christmas. \nColin disappears.  A red light goes on.  Becca pushes a button.  Another face comes on the screen.  \"Oakland\" appears under the face. \nBECCA Stand by, Benson, we're still wrapping up foreign. \nShe turns pointedly to Chuck. \nBECCA Chuck, thanks for joining us.  Status? \nChuck swallows nervously, tries to talk matter-of-factly. \nCHUCK Becca, as you know St. Petersburg was consistently running late by six to ten hours -- sometimes a full day or more.  I replaced the station manager.  We identified inefficiencies and worked out a quality improvement plan I believe can be met. \nMAYNARD You replaced the station manager with a driver.  A local with no knowledge of our systems. \nBECCA Shouldn't you have brought in someone from Memphis?  Russia is priority one. \nMAYNARD James Pottinger is available. \nThe process is being ripped out of Chuck's hands.  He struggles to get an answer. \nSTAN He's a numbers cruncher.  Chuck's done all the right things here... \nStan is doing his best to back up Chuck. \nCHUCK Jim's a terrific financial man, no question.  But we can't always parachute in from Memphis.  We've got to build up our local staff. \nMAYNARD We've got to improve foreign on-time, that's what we've got to do.  If this new guy's so good, how come the very first plane he sent missed the connection in Paris? \nMaynard knows how to go for the jugular.  Everyone looks at Chuck. \nCHUCK We're building a new team here.  We got every package on the truck for the first time ever.  Success is the best teacher. \nMAYNARD I don't call missing the plane a success. \nEveryone looks at Chuck. \nEXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY - LATE THAT AFTERNOON \nChuck lugs a big package up to the door, knocks on it.  Kelly opens the door. \nKELLY Merry Christmas eve. \nCHUCK Not if you work for FedEx. \nINT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY \nChuck enters as they keep talking.  Her house is cozy but also where she works.  There's a computer, specimen jars, and some terrariums with frogs inside.  A Christmas tree with packages under it. \nKELLY You break four million packages last night? \nINT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER \nChuck enters.  The tree and the presents under it are gone. \nCHUCK Kelly?  Kelly? \nNo answer, nothing but the sound of Jango, who begins yelping in the kitchen. \nINT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck picks up Jango, who is barricaded in the kitchen with some food, some water, and some wet newspapers. \nCHUCK There.  There.  Easy now. \nEXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER \nHolding Jango, Chuck walks out into the back yard. \nCHUCK Kelly? \nA fire still smolders.  The packages have burned.  The tree is a blackened mess. \nChuck stares at it. \nEXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING \nChuck gets into his car, puts Jango on the front seat next to him.  Pulls out of the driveway. \nEXT.  ARKANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY \nChuck is in his car, with the dog on his lap. \nEXT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY \nChuck's car drives up to a typical Arkansas farm house.  His MOM is setting some Christmas tree lights around the door. Chuck gets out of the car.  There's a large wet spot on the front of his pants. \nMOM What happened to your pants? \nCHUCK Mom, meet Jango. \nChuck displays the puppy. \nEXT.  FARM HOUSE - SHED - DAY \nChuck works on an old tractor in the shed.  Some small legs appear in his vision, then a small face.  This is AMANDA, his niece. \nAMANDA Dinner's ready. \nINT.  FARM HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nAround the table are Chuck's brother ROGER, his wife MARY, Amanda, and her TWO BROTHERS.  Mom brings in the turkey, places it on the table, sits down.  They all hold hands and bow their heads. \nMOM Chuck? \nChuck hesitates just a moment. \nCHUCK Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen. \nROGER Let's eat. \nEXT.  FARM HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY \nThe children burst out the door, shrieking, chased by Jango. \nINT.  FARM HOUSE - DAY \nThe grown-ups are cleaning up after Christmas dinner.  The scene moves between the table, the kitchen counter, and the refrigerator.  It's an old-fashioned kitchen, simply furnished. \nMARY How's Kelly? \nCHUCK Great. \nROGER Thought you were going to bring her. \nCHUCK So did I. \nMOM It seemed like she had such a good time last time. \nCHUCK It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me. \nMARY Jennifer's still down at the post office. And she's still got that crush on you. \nROGER And she's still got those -- \nMARY Roger. \nROGER You should have stuck around. \nThis is an old, sore subject. \nCHUCK Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom? \nMOM That new roof, that's your doing. \nROGER You're just allergic to farming, that's what dad said.  Can't stand to be alone. Can't stand to be in one place.  Can't stand the sight of...blood. \nHe drops the turkey giblets into the trash. \nMARY Roger's going to put chickens in here. \nChuck can't believe this. \nCHUCK Come on Roger, this is dad all over again.  You already did beefalo, chinchillas, and what was that, ostrich? They chased Mom around the yard, sprained her hip. \nCHUCK Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us? \nVOICE (SQUAWK BOX) Kamal is not here. \nCHUCK Who is this?  Where is Kamal? \nVOICE (SQUAWK BOX) It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter. \nCHUCK What's going on down there? \nVOICE (SQUAWK BOX) Kamal is not here.  We are very defused. \nCHUCK Who's in charge then, where is Chinn? \nThe squawk box hums and crackles.  Nothing.  Chuck turns to the Technician. \nSTAN We got Telex, e-mail? \nTECHNICIAN Sure.  Just not getting any answers. \nChuck turns to Leslie. \nCHUCK When's the next Jumbo? \nLESLIE The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow. \nCHUCK Anything else? \nLESLIE There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney. \nSTAN Maybe you should get your ducks lined up first. \nChuck looks over at Stan. \nCHUCK Call Operations.  Get me on it. \nAnd Stan is impressed. \nEXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - DAY \nChuck leaves with his bag over his shoulder and the puppy under his arm. \nEXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY - MINUTES LATER \nKelly opens the door.  Chuck is there with the puppy. \nKELLY That's your dog. \nCHUCK It's our dog.  It belongs to us. \nKELLY There isn't any us. \nCHUCK Yes there is. \nKelly can't stay mad. \nKELLY I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away. \nCHUCK No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill -- \nKELLY I burned the Christmas tree. \nShe's half-laughing, half-wanting-to-cry. \nKELLY Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was. \nCHUCK I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt. \nKELLY What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now. \nCHUCK Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back. \nKELLY Don't even start. \nAnd then it hits her. \nKELLY Get back?  From where? \nCHUCK Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep. \nShe stares at him for a long moment, then at the puppy. \nKELLY Give him to me. \nHe hands her the dog. \nKELLY Chuck, you're breaking my heart. \nCHUCK A week, max.  Okay?  Okay? \nKELLY Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs. \nShe kisses the puppy. \nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT \nChuck enters the cockpit, where two different pilots are going through their checklists.  Chuck repeats his familiar patter. \nCHUCK Al -- gotta be something wrong with our physicals, you keep getting certified to fly.  John, aren't you worried? \nJOHN I disconnected his controls.  He only thinks he's flying. \nChuck settles into his seat. \nThe moon has just begun to rise, casting eerie light into the jungle.  The shadows reach out to grab Chuck, then real branches and vines tug at him.  He heads into thick blackness. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER \nChuck emerges around the rocks.  He reaches the stack of familiar FedEx boxes -- Ahh, home!  He's breathing hard, from both fear and exertion. \nCHUCK Got to drink.  Got to drink something. \nWith his last strength he opens a coconut on the stick.  He bangs hard on the shell and gulps down the milk.  He stares at the stack of FedEx boxes.  What could be inside?  He reaches out and touches one. \nCHUCK They don't belong to you. \nResponsibility gets the better of necessity, and he takes his hand away. \nEXT.  BEACH - MORNING \nFace red from the sun, Chuck hacks at a palm frond with his stone knife.  He saws the palm frond off near the base, leaving it about a foot long. \nCHUCK Got to have shade.  Got to have a hat. \nHe ties the loose fibers into a sort of circle, then sets it upon his head.  It looks amazingly like some sort of primitive cap. \nHe grabs a couple of FedEx boxes and heads for the beach. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER \nChuck finishes the P on H E L P, which he has spelled out with the FedEx boxes on the beach. \nEXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER \nChuck scrambles down a ravine.  He kneels down and feels the ground.  It is dry, completely dry. \nEXT.  LAVA SLOPE - DAY \nChuck traverses the slope, determined to find water. \nA FLAT ROCK - LATER \nWith a puddle of dirty water trapped in a tiny hollow. Suddenly Chuck flops down into frame.  He tries to scoop up some water in his hands, but he just splashes it around.  He licks his fingers.  Then he gets down on his stomach and laps up the water with his tongue.  Like an animal. \nIn the bottom of the small depression is some fine mud.  He rubs it on his reddened face and across his burned lips. \nCHUCK Oh, God.  Thank you. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT \nChuck lies in darkness, his eyes reflecting the moon. \nEXT.  JUNGLE - DAY \nChuck is drenched in sweat.  He is at the bottom of a hole six feet deep.  He takes one last dig with the flat stick, then licks the moist clay that sticks to it. \nEXT.  BEACH - DAY \nChuck breaks open another coconut and gulps down the milky liquid.  With a stone knife he digs in the shell for some of the meat, but it's dry and chewy and fibrous.  He spits it out, then lies back on the sand and stares at the first stars.  Half sings to himself. \nCHUCK You deserve a break today... \nHe is desperately thirsty.  Hunger gnaws at him. \nEXT.  BEACH - DAY - LATER \nHolding a sharpened stick, Chuck wades in the shallows at low tide, looking for fish.  It's difficult to keep his balance. Suddenly a shadow flashes by, glinting in the morning sunlight.  Chuck hurls the spear, which ricochets off the water and floats away. \nChuck plunges into the water after the fish with his bare hands.  The fish reverses direction.  Chuck leaps after it and goes under.  He comes up spluttering, on his hands and knees in the shallows. \nSuddenly a whole school of fish swims by him, moving in unison, like one creature, splitting around Chuck like mercury.  He grabs at them desperately.  Nothing. \nCHUCK Damn fish! \nOn some rocks he sees clusters of limpets.  He takes a rock and tries to dislodge one, but it smashes into a soggy mess. \nEXT.  BEACH - DAY \nDiscouraged, he sits down on the beach and gets his breath. \nIdly, Chuck takes out his wallet.  The money is soaked.  He lays it out to dry.  He finds a PHOTOGRAPH OF KELLY, soaked and mushy. \nHe tries to smooth it out.  For a moment he is overcome.  His face tightens, his eyes get moist.  He stares out to sea. \nCHUCK Wait a minute.  Wait just a minute. \nHe picks up his wallet again and takes out a credit card. \nEXT.  BEACH - MINUTES LATER \nChuck wades in the water, stops by a rock covered with limpets.  He uses a CREDIT CARD to scrape off a limpet. \nCHUCK Don't leave home without it. \nWith his finger, he prods around in the mucous-like meat, then tilts up the shell and we see the gooey gray stuff slide off the shell into his mouth. \nCHUCK Yuck. \nHe starts to spit it out.  Tries to make himself like it. \nCHUCK Yumm. \nAnd he swallow it. \nEXT.  BEACH - SUNSET \nChuck sits in the shade of a palm tree surrounded by a pile of smashed coconut husks and a stack of limpet shells.  He checks his watch for a moment. \nCHUCK Okay.  Okay now. \nEXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER \nHands bandaged, Chuck tries to strike a spark on the roller blade wheel housing.  Tries over and over.  Nothing. \nHe takes a long drink from his canteen, and flinches.  His tooth is starting to hurt.  He fishes some Tylenol out of the surgeon's bag and takes two. \nEXT.  OTHER SIDE OF ISLAND - DAY \nChuck picks some berries and gingerly tries them.  They're not bad.  He eats more.  Then more.  What a relief. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT \nChuck lies on his palm fronds, groaning and holding his stomach.  He drags himself to his knees, crawls a few feet, and throws up in great, violent heaves. \nEXT.  BEACH - DAY \nStill looking a little green, Chuck marks another day on his tree calendar. \nEXT.  SUMMIT \nHe stares out to sea.  Nothing. \nEXT.  WELL - DAY \nChuck lies on his belly and drinks from the well, which has filled with water.  Then he washes his face and splashes water over his neck.  The surface of the well stills, bringing CHUCK'S REFLECTION into focus.  He stares at himself. \nVery carefully Chuck shaves with the surgeon's scalpel. \nChuck checks out his new appearance in the water.  Much better.  A clean start now. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY \nHe sits in front of his failed efforts to make fire. \nCHUCK You're not getting it hot enough.  Got to hold the heat.  Got to hold the heat. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER \nChuck carefully shaves some tinder.  Puts it under a piece of bamboo split lengthwise with a notch cut across it. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER \nChuck uses a bamboo stick to try to make friction in the split half of the bamboo.  He saws back and forth with all his might, pressing it down in the groove. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER \nChuck gives one last saw with his bamboo and stops, utterly defeated.  It's all too much. \nCHUCK Sonofabitch! \nHe starts to rub again.  He breathes hard, sweat pours off his face.  He is really going for it, what the hell!  A tiny wisp of smoke appears!  Chuck saws with even more energy. \nCHUCK Come on.  Come on. \nThe smoke increases.  Chuck rips away the bamboo, grabs the nest of shavings, and blows on it frantically.  The smoke flickers and dies.  Chuck can't believe it. \nCHUCK No.  No.  No. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT \nChuck lies in his bed of palm fronds, shivering.  He looks up at the stars, which blaze furiously. \nCHUCK That's the big dipper...Orion...or is that the Southern Cross...?  Kelly would know. \nAnd he misses her so much.  A shower of meteors streaks across the sky, as if the very heavens are raining down on Chuck. \nEXT.  BEACH - DAY \nChuck readies his two sticks of bamboo again and begins sawing with tremendous energy.  He smells something.  Is it smoke?  He pulls off the log and looks eagerly at the nest of tinder.  There's nothing there. \nCHUCK Dammit! \nHe replaces the log and starts wearily to saw again. \nTIME CUT \nThe sun has moved in the sky.  Chuck is still sawing.  Again the smoke appears.  Again sweat pours from his face.  The smoke increases.  He saws even harder.  His breath comes in anguished gulps.  Smoke is curling up now.  Chuck tears away the bamboo, picks up the nest of kindling, and blows on it gently.  The smoke increases. \nHe blows some more.  A fragile crimson spark appears. \nCHUCK Careful now, careful... \nHe gently places the nest of shavings in the kindling, then blows on it with utmost care, as if he were holding life itself.  He shreds his money and business cards over the tiny flame. \nSuddenly, the evening breeze lifts the nest out of the kindling.  Desperate, Chuck grabs it.  Trying to shield it with his body, he grabs some palm fronds and jams them into the sand, trying to make a windbreak.  They rustle and shake and blow over. \nThe wind blows harder.  Chuck jams some rocks in a circle to make an eddy.  But the fire is out.  No words now, just a loud, primal groan of pure despair. \nAnd then, into his vision floats...smoke. \nChuck looks down.  A wisp of smoke curls up from the nest of tinder!  Chuck blows on it gently.  Suddenly a tiny tongue of flame flickers and catches on the kindling! \nCHUCK Yes!  Yes!  Yes! \nHe feeds in some more twigs, more tinder.  The flames lick out, catch, grow. \nCHUCK If I ever forgot to thank you God, and I am sure I did, thank you now. \nEXT.  BEACH - WIDE - NIGHT \nThe fire burns on the beach.  Chuck rushes about, piling on driftwood. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT \nChuck stands by the edge of the water, which shimmers in the reflected light of the fire.  A wave come in, licks at his toes.  Lifts up a coconut husk, sweeps it gently out.  Chuck watches, gets an idea. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT \nHe begins to dig in the sand by the raft.  He grabs the oar and digs faster, making a trench up to where the raft is. \nEXT.  BEACH - MORNING \nThe rising tide floods water into the trench.  Chuck rocks the raft back and forth.  It floats!  As the wave recedes, it takes the raft with it.  Chuck has to run beside it. \nCHUCK TRYING TO ESCAPE - MONTAGE \nOver and over, we see Chuck capsize at the reef.  The first time he has a bandage on his leg.  He tries everything -- different rafts, different approaches, but each time the ocean spits him back. \nEXT.  LAGOON - DAY \nDefeated and utterly exhausted, Chuck swims back from his latest failure.  He wades back ashore with the FedEx box and throws it on the ground by the palm tree.  He has tried so hard to escape, so incredibly hard, done everything humanly possible and beyond.  He rips off his life preserver, throws it into the underbrush, then collapses on the beach. \nCHUCK You're too low in the water.  Too damn low. \nChuck's shoulders begin to shake, as he is racked with deep sobs of despair. \nAnd then he throws his head back and lets forth, from deep inside himself, a SCREAM of rage and anger and pain.  The Scream pierces the indifferent natural sounds of the island, the rustling of the breeze, the lulling rhythm of the waves. It is powerful, disturbing, primal. \nThe breeze picks up.  Behind Chuck, the palm trees begin to sway.  The tide is reaching up toward the beach.  The waves crash louder.  The palm trees sway even more. \nChuck picks up some wet sand and rubs it on his body. \nCHUCK Dust thou art -- that's for damned sure -- and unto dust shalt thou return. \nA few DROPS OF RAIN begin to fall, splashing on Chuck and sizzling in the fire. \nChuck looks up:  clouds have obscured the sun.  The wind blows harder.  The rain falls harder, streaking the sand Chuck had rubbed on his body.  STEAM sizzles out of the fire. \nChuck looks up, disbelieving.  The bottom falls out of the heavens -- monsoon rain, more rain than you have ever seen before.  A long wave rolls up, its frothy fingers reaching for the fire. \nForget the raft!  Forget despair!  The fire could go out! This is disaster! \nCHUCK Shit! \nHe springs into action.  Chuck grabs an empty FedEx box. With his wooden shovel he frantically SCOOPS SOME COALS out of the fire as the rain HISSES and POUNDS at them.  He slides the coals into the FedEx box, grabs some sticks of driftwood and sets off on a run. \nEXT.  WOODS - DAY \nChuck runs through the woods, slipping and stumbling.  Vines grab at him.  The rain is so thick he can hardly see. \nEXT.  WOODS - MINUTES LATER \nChuck bursts out of the woods into the lava field.  Smoke pours out of the FedEx box.  The coals are about to burn through! \nEXT.  LAVA FIELD - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck stumbles up the slippery rocks, dragging the smoking box.  His face is drenched, desperate. \nEXT.  CAVE - DAY - MINUTES LATER \nChuck tumbles into the cave just as the coals burn through the FedEx box. \nUsing the remains of the box, he desperately tries to scoot the coals into a dry spot. \nOne by one, THE PRECIOUS COALS GO OUT. \nDripping water off his hands and face, he pushes a few together with his fingers, ignoring the burns. \nCHUCK Please...please...please... \nHe stomps on the driftwood and saws at it with his knife.  He places this kindling on the coals.  They sputter and sizzle. Barely catch.  He fans them with the box.  A tiny flicker catches, then starts to grow. \nCHUCK Firewood.  I need firewood. \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nOn the beach, Chuck desperately gathers more firewood in the driving monsoon.  He can barely see.  Driven by the storm, the waves are licking at the palm grove. \nHe runs through the woods.  Branches whip at his face.  Roots tear at his feet, tripping him. \nHe stumbles up the lava field.  Sliding.  Struggling.  Barely able to breathe, the rain is so strong. \nINT.  CAVE - DAY \nHe dumps the firewood on the floor of the cave.  But where the fire had flickered, there is only a pile of wet black ashes. \nTHE FIRE IS OUT. \nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT \nChuck lies on the floor of the cave, shivering in the darkness as the rain falls.  His fire is out, his tooth is killing him, he can't escape. \nEXT.  CAVE - NEXT DAY \nChuck emerges from the cave.  The rain has stopped.  This is the absolute lowest.  His face reflects his pain and despair. He's trapped.  It's hopeless.  Everything he tried to build is gone. \nEXT.  LEDGE - DAY \nChuck slowly walks out on the ledge.  He stares down at the waves breaking on the jagged rocks far below. \nHe lets go one hand.  Then lets go the other.  He is barely balanced.  It looks like a wisp of breeze would blow him right off.  He slides one foot to the very lip of the precipice. \nSuddenly his foot slips! \nInstinctively he turns into the cliff, grabs for a hold!  One hand reaches for a nubbing of rock, slips off!  The other closes, his fingers straining to hold him. \nHe ties the string tightly around the shaft.  He does his work automatically. \nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT - LATER \nChuck eats some fish and some mashed breadfruit.  He chews each bite, his eyes in distant focus.  The firelight flickers on his face. \nEXT.  CLIFF - SUNRISE \nChuck carries firewood up to the summit.  He mechanically adds wood to the fire.  As he does so, something out to sea catches his eye.  He stops and stands up. \nCHUCK'S POV - WHALES \nWHALES broach out past the rocky point.  Spouts of water shoot into the air. \nON CHUCK \nAs he watches them, a light comes back into his eyes.  He grins.  There's a big gap where his teeth had been.  He turns and strides down the hill. \nEXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER \nHe heads across the rock bridge that once had so terrified him, without losing stride.  It's second nature now. \nINT.  CAVE - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck enters the cave, picks up the ball and heads out. \nEXT.  SUMMIT - EVENING \nThe signal fire burns.  A spectacular cloudy sunset lights up the sky.  Chuck sits with Wilson on the summit, a bowl of mashed breadfruit in one hand, a bowl of roasted eel skin in another. \nAs Chuck watches the sunset unfold, watches the whales going by in the darkened water, he takes some roasted eel chips, dips them into the breadfruit paste, and offers one to Wilson.  His voice is flat, monotonal. \nCHUCK Chips?  Dip? \nBut Wilson declines. \nCHUCK No? \nHe takes a big crunchy bite. \nCHUCK Another fucking day in paradise. \nPULL BACK as the sun goes down and Chuck reaches into the bowl again and dips an eel skin chip in the dip. \nEXT.  ROCKY LEDGE - NIGHT - LATER \nTorch in one hand, Wilson in the other, Chuck walks across the rocky ledge.  He passes the flume without even noticing. \nSuddenly his shoe breaks!  It's sandal made of woven yucca leaves. \nHe bends down and fixes it, then heads on down the ledge. \nEXT.  LEDGE - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck makes a casual leap, a leap he has made hundreds of times, but this time the sandal comes loose.  It catches on a rock, and CHUCK FALLS! \nHis hands are cut and bruised.  He tries to get up, can't. Chuck sits back and examines his foot.  His fingers come back covered with blood.  He reaches out to steady himself, and leaves a HANDPRINT OF BLOOD on the rock. \nINT.  CAVE - LATER \nChuck wraps his foot in bandages. \nINT.  CAVE - LATER \nChuck's face is sweaty.  He looks down at his foot.  It is red, swollen, infected.  He stands up, tries to put some weight on it.  The pain is intense. \nChuck sticks the scalpel onto some coals to sterilize it.  He holds it over his foot, takes a breath, then jabs in into the wound.  The pain is intense.  Chuck passes out. \nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT \nChuck stirs, takes a drink, weakly tosses on another log, and collapses back on the floor. \nINT.  CAVE - DAY \nChuck wakes up, trembling, shaking, wet with sweat.  He staggers up.  His shadow sways on the wall of the cave.  He struggles to get another log on the fire.  He squints at his only companion, the soccer ball. \nCHUCK Help me, Wilson... \nHe collapses again. \nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT \nChuck stirs and squints his eyes.  He takes a drink of water. He is feeling better.  He puts another log on the fire and slowly begins to chew on some breadfruit and dried fish. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER \nChuck slowly wades into the water, favoring his injured foot. But something feels different.  He glances around.  What is it?  And then he sees something, perhaps the worst possible sight. \nCHUCK'S POV - SAIL \nA SAIL is moving steadily away from the island. \nCHUCK \nThrows down the spear and waves his arms. \nCHUCK No!  Wait!  Come back! \nHe runs into the water and starts to swim.  He is so weak, however, he can only make a few strokes.  He tries to yell as he swims... \nCHUCK Wait!  Wait! \nChoking and weak, he turns back and drags himself up on the beach.  In the b.g., the sail dwindles into the distance. \nChuck goes from tree to tree, making handprints along his path.  Chuck was here.  This is his mark. \nEXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY \nHe covers the calendar trees with handprints.  Then stops. Sees something.  Eyes fixed on the beach, he walks toward the shoreline. \nEXT.  BEACH - DAY \nChuck emerges from the palm trees, and now we see what he had seen. \nA FIFTY-FIVE GALLON OIL DRUM. \nAnd another one.  TWO.  Chuck stares at the barrels. \nCHUCK Hello. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER \nChuck sits staring at the oil drums.  It's almost as if he is hesitating to take advantage of them.  That he may not want, really, to leave now. \nThen his inner struggle ends. \nCHUCK What the hell are you waiting for? \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER \nFilled with determination, Chuck rolls a barrel up the beach. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER \nUsing a palm tree as a fulcrum, Chuck hauls hard on a rope made of vines, pulling the barrel up off the beach. \nEXT.  JUNGLE - DAY \nChuck throws aside palm leaves, revealing...the remains of his raft. \nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT \nChuck is drawing with a purpose now.  And we see what he is working on.  The plans for a raft. \nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT \nChuck is making a list of what he needs.  He works intently. \nCHUCK Canteens.  Sea anchor.  Got to weave rope.  Spears.  A sail. \nEXT.  JUNGLE - DAY \nChuck lashes the barrels onto the raft.  Checks the knots. Lashes more rope. \nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT \nHe sews dresses together with handmade fiber string. \nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT \nHe weaves videotape together to form a sea anchor. \nEXT.  BEACH - DAY \nChuck digs a channel toward the raft. \nINT.  CAVE - DAY \nChuck constructs a water collection device with some FedEx boxes, some plastic weighted with a stone.  Explains it to Wilson. \nCHUCK Now I'm hoping that if this is airtight I'll get condensation down here, a cup or so a day.  If I'm careful it should be enough. \nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT \nChuck writes on the wall. \nCHUCK If I never return, know that here lived Chuck Noland for four years.  I drew these paintings.  I made these marks. And then I took my fate in my own hands and set forth to save myself, God willing. \nEXT.  BEACH - DAY \nChuck loads the raft, which rocks gently in the cove.  He has a sail made of designer dresses sewn together with fiber thread.  A sea anchor secured by videotape woven together into a rope.  Plastic bottles filled with water.  A signal kite made of FedEx paper. \nThen comes the FedEx box with the angel wings.  Then Wilson. \nCHUCK Wilson, my main man.  Time to go. \nAnd he gently leads the raft into the lagoon. \nCHUCK Wonder what odds Stan would give me on this.  I'd say 90-10.  Against. \nHe jumps onto the raft, begins to paddle out toward where the surf crashes onto the reef. \nEXT.  LAGOON - DAY \nWaves break against the reef.  With his paddles Chuck maneuvers the raft toward the cut in the reef.  Boom!  The wave crashes, the water surges through the cut, then recedes with a whoosh. \nChuck watches, times the waves, paddles like mad.  He's committed.  SCRAPE goes the first barrel, then the second, riding the receding wave.  He's out! \nBut the next wave is already surging forward.  It smashes the raft against the reef!  Coconuts and foodstuffs hurtle off the raft! \nThe barrels cushion the impact.  The raft tilts, spins, but stays outside the reef!  The ropes holding the jugs of water break!  The water sweeps overboard! \nThe wave recedes again.  Chuck recovers, paddles with all his strength, and then he's clear of the breakers! \nFor a long moment he floats on the rollers, getting his breath. \nThe water jugs float away, carried by the waves back into the lagoon.  Chuck could go back and get them.  If he were being prudent, he definitely would. \nHe pulls himself back on the raft. \nHe lies there exhausted, the glow from the phosphorescence casting a greenish light on his face. \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nClouds are building up.  In the distance lightning flashes. The clouds come closer. \nLittle bits of electricity jump off the mast.  Saint Elmos fire jumps around Chuck's hand. \nFascinated, he holds out his hand.  The fire jumps from his hand to the mast. \nSuddenly lightning shoots from the sky and strikes the ocean! A huge spout of water explodes like a depth charge.  The CRACK is intense, then rolls away. \nChuck stares, then realizes the danger and throws himself down on the raft.  Suddenly a wall of rain sweeps over him and the ocean begins to roll.  The thunder is deafening. Lightning flashes bursts through the rain. \nCHUCK Sea anchor!  Let out the sea anchor! \nFrantic, Chuck lets out the sea anchor as the raft scuds down a huge wave.  The anchor catches, slowing the raft so that it rides the wave down. \nThe waves come at him high as houses.  The raft rides up one side, then plunges down the next. \nAll Chuck can do is hold on. \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nThe storm has passed.  The raft floats on big dark rollers. \nWe hear the chirping and squeaking of dolphins.  They come close to the raft.  Chuck watches them play.  Then realizes they are chasing his fish.  They drive them along, into the path of another dolphin, who darts in and rips into the dorado, turning the water around the raft into churning, bloody foam. \nCHUCK Stop! \nHe takes his oar and begins beating the water.  The killing continues. \nCHUCK You fucking murderers! \nSuddenly the water is still.  One dolphin sticks its head out of the water and stares at Chuck, squeaking. \nAnother dolphin lifts its head up, then another.  They squeak to each other, clearly communicating and talking about Chuck. \nCHUCK I know you're talking about me! \nHe splashes the water with his oar. \nThey dive, then jump into the air, squeaking as they go. \nCHUCK (very softly) Take me with you. \nThey're gone. \nCHUCK Why me?  Why me, God? \nHe begins to laugh. \nBADCHUCK Listen to this, Wilson. (deep voice: God) Because you piss me off. \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nChuck tries to stretch with some simple yoga.  Each movement takes forever. \nHe rolls over onto his stomach and tries to do a pushup.  He can't.  Collapses onto the raft. \nBADCHUCK You're falling apart. \nTries to do another pushup.  Can't. \nBADCHUCK First you eat your fat, then you eat your muscle. \nHe rolls over. \nBADCHUCK Then you eat your mind. \nHe looks at the ocean.  They're in a line of garbage, a thick slick of debris dumped off of ships. \nGOODCHUCK Roll on you deep and dark blue ocean roll. \nHe closes his eyes.  After a minute they come open. \nGOODCHUCK I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date. \nThey slowly close again. \nBADCHUCK I'm lost.  Goodbye. \nGOODCHUCK No! \nHis eyes come open again. \nBADCHUCK Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep. \nGOODCHUCK You quitter you quitter you quitter. \nBADCHUCK The sea is lovely, dark and deep. \nGOODCHUCK But I have promises to keep. (rolls over) And miles to go before I sleep. (props himself up) And miles to go before I sleep. (purpose now) Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail. \nBADCHUCK Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move. \nGOODCHUCK If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize. \nBADCHUCK Die tomorrow or die today. \nHe hums Beethoven's fifth.  BA BA BA BUM. \nIf the Dorado was a gift from God, this is a message from Hell. \nThen the shark is gone. \nEXT.  RAFT - DAY - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck lies back on the raft.  He is humming. \nBADCHUCK What are you smiling about?  They'll be back. \nGOODCHUCK I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly. \nHe smiles at the thought. \nGOODCHUCK The music ends.  We go back to the table. The waiters have brought dinner.  New York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce. Mushrooms in brown gravy.  Roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary.  Green Beans with almonds.  Fresh biscuits and cornbread, dripping with butter.  A nice salad with ranch dressing.  A jumbo shrimp cocktail. \nThinks about that, it spoils the picture. \nGOODCHUCK No shrimp. (then) We eat. \nHe closes his eyes.  This is the greatest fantasy. \nGOODCHUCK (as the waiter) For dessert, we have pecan pie a la mode, we have a double chocolate cake with creme anglaise, we have a nice pear torte, fresh key lime pie, or perhaps if you care to wait a few minutes, a grand marnier souffle? \nChuck thinks over the options, thinking of each one. \nGOODCHUCK Why, bring them all, bring them all. \nHe rolls over.  There, square in his vision, is a ship, its form coming in and out of a low haze. \nChuck jumps to his feet.  Waves.  Screams. \nGOODCHUCK Here!  Over here! \nThe ship moves on.  We can see the decks the rigging, the vastness of it. \nChuck realizes he is naked.  Struggles to pull on the remains of his pants finally holds them like a diaper with one hand as he continues to wave. \nOn the ship no one is to be seen.  It is a spooky sight. \nThe big tanker moves on. \nWe are on Chuck's face.  Passed up again. \nThen he realizes what is about to happen.  He throws out the sea anchor. \nHe throws himself onto the raft and grips it as tight as he can, wiggles his feet into the ropes. \nCHUCK Oh, shiiiittt! \nThen comes the wake of the ship.  It rocks the raft like a piece of flotsam.  The raft rides high up on the wave, then shoots down it, but the sea anchor holds, and the raft slows and rides along with the wave. \nAnd then the sea is calm again. \nSlowly Chuck sinks to his knees.  His hand lets loose his pants. \nHe lies down on the raft and imagines the conversation with the ship's captain. \nCHUCK Permission to come aboard, sir. \nCHUCK/CAPTAIN Permission granted. \nCHUCK May I ask, where are you bound? \nCHUCK/CAPTAIN San Francisco.  And you? \nCHUCK As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself. \nCHUCK/CAPTAIN Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie... \nCHUCK No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on. \nThe depression comes back again. \nBADCHUCK They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean. \nGOODCHUCK They're on autopilot. \nBADCHUCK They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you. \nGOODCHUCK Damn it!  Don't be so negative! \nChuck picks up Wilson. \nGOODCHUCK Wilson, what's your story? \nHe holds Wilson close to his chest. \nBADCHUCK I float.  You sink.  End of story. \nGOODCHUCK I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn. \nBADCHUCK It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot. \nGOODCHUCK Shut up. \nHe lies on the raft and holds Wilson close. \nWe move up until we see -- \nEXT.  OCEAN - AERIAL - EVENING \nChuck lying curled up on the raft, Wilson cradled in his arms, and all around the vast empty ocean. \nFinally he reaches it, hangs on the side, breathing hard, choking, crying. \nHe struggles to pull himself on board. \nBut he is weak, so weak.  He can't do it. \nSummoning some primitive reserve of strength, he tries again. This time he slides on. \nHe lies on the raft, panting. \nThen with all his strength he pulls himself to his feet, holds on to the mast, scans the ocean for Wilson. \nCHUCK Wilson! \nNothing but waves. \nThis is too much.  Chuck starts to cry. \nEXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER \nChuck takes a swallow of water, washes it around in his mouth, then swallows.  With his wet tongue he licks his cracked lips. \nThe sun breaks through the clouds. \nWith what strength he has left, Chuck raises the canopy, fastens it. \nHe sits in the meager shade, his head between his knees. \nCloses his eyes.  Just for a minute. \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER \nA different sort of shadow crosses Chuck's face.  He opens his eyes. \nThere, riding right beside his raft, is a ship, a huge rusty tanker.  Someone shouts down in a language we don't understand. \nChuck sits up, can't believe it.  Struggles to cover himself. \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER \nChuck is lifted up the rusted steel side of the boat in a Jacob's ladder. \nEXT.  SHIP - DAY - LATER \nChuck steps on board, can't support himself. \nThe crew gathers around.  None of them speak English, but there is a spontaneous outburst of human connection. \nOne man brings some water.  Another a blanket.  Another some warm tea. \nChuck sits there, shivering now. \nCHUCK Thank you.  Oh thank you. \nDeliriously happy.  Delirious. \nINT.  U.S. NAVAL HOSPITAL - HAWAII \nA cavernous hanger-sized ward brightly lit and filled with row upon row of hospital beds, each with its table, side chair, and lamp, each with a stainless steel bedpan and neatly folded sheets and blankets stacked ready to use, and each completely empty. \nExcept for one. \nAnd on that bed we see Chuck, in a blue hospital gown.  An IV drips into his arm.  He plays idly with the remote control of the bed.  He raises the head, then the foot.  He pushes another button and the knee rest bends the bed again. \nA DOCTOR enters, carrying a thick chart.  Chuck gives him a big manic grin.  Malcolm MacDowell in \"A Clockwork Orange.\" \nCHUCK My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict? \nDOCTOR Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely. \nHe checks his blood work records. \nDOCTOR Hemoglobin's 10.8 -- you're anemic, that's why we're giving you iron. Potassium's low -- we're giving you an electrolyte solution with your IV. Sodium's over 150, way too high.  You may experience swelling in your extremities as you rehydrate and discharge the salt. In spite of your dietary deficiencies there's no sign of mental deterioration. \nChuck has been trying not to laugh.  Now he can't stop himself. \nDOCTOR What's so funny. \nChuck can't seem to help laughing at everything. \nCHUCK Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache? \nDOCTOR Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above. \nCHUCK All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein. \nDOCTOR Protein digestion is very costly in water usage. \nCHUCK Which I didn't have. \nDOCTOR And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy. \nChuck laughs again. \nCHUCK I am one lucky guy. \nDOCTOR Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out. \nCHUCK But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now. \nHe starts to laugh again. \nDOCTOR If you say you are. \nCHUCK We're not meant to be alone.  Not like that.  Share life, that's what came to me out there.  Be with someone. \nAnd that's the point, isn't it?  We are social animals.  No man is an island. \nKELLY This is so unfair. \nCHUCK That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway. \nAnd the laughter comes again.  Kelly grins, embarrassed, a little worried. \nKELLY You okay? \nCHUCK Great.  Really. \nShe stares at his face, reaches out, touches it again, this time with great tenderness. \nHe nods, her touch feels so good. \nA wave of emotion comes over her:  pity?  love? \nKELLY What will you do? \nCHUCK I don't know.  I really don't know. \nWe hear a distant beep-beep, discrete as a car horn can be. \nKELLY I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals. \nCHUCK It means a lot...that you came. \nKELLY I had to come.  To be sure you were okay. \nThey hold each other.  For a long time. \nKELLY I love you, Chuck. \nCHUCK You too. \nKELLY I'm so glad you're alive. \nChuck grins. \nCHUCK You too. \nThen she heads for the waiting car.  Chuck stands by his raft, watching her go. \nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT \nChuck and Stan ride on the plane.  Chuck is coming down off his survival high.  He has the Angel Wing FedEx package with him. \nSTAN When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles. \nCHUCK I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing. \nStan pulls a flask out of his bag. \nSTAN You need a drink. \nStan takes two glasses from his bag, rests them on a FedEx container, and pours the whiskey. \nCHUCK For years my only drinking buddy was a soccer ball.  Wilson. \nStan hoists his glass. \nSTAN To Wilson. \nCHUCK To Wilson. \nNow's when Stan gets to the question he's been wanting to ask, that Kelly wanted to know, that we all want to know. \nSTAN So, what's it all about? \nChuck stares at him. \nSTAN You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah! \nCHUCK Hallelujah. \nStan looks over at him. \nSTAN I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon... \nCHUCK What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about. \nStan sits back, repulsed but relieved. \nSTAN Do what it takes.  That's what I always told you. \nHe pours another drink. \nSTAN To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke. \nCHUCK To life. \nSTAN That's all there is. \nCHUCK Believe me I know. \nHe takes a sip of his drink, just savoring it, thinking. \nCHUCK But it's not being bold or being in the game or rolling the dice. \nAll those things Stan used to tell him. \nCHUCK Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific. \nHe looks around at everyone, doesn't know what else to say. \nCHUCK I've never heard it this quiet. Shouldn't you all be getting back to work? \nThe tension is broken.  Everyone laughs.  Phil Steele motions with his hand.  Let it be done. \nANOTHER ANGLE - WIDE \nThe vast, incredible machinery creaks to a start.  Everyone shakes Chuck's hand as he leaves the podium. \nAs he heads for the car, REPORTERS shout questions. \nINT.  CAR - MEMPHIS FREEWAY \nWe are assaulted by a surge of light, motion, activity. Snaking lines of traffic in both directions, big overpasses, the city rising beyond. \nStan drives with a certain aggressiveness.  Chuck looks out at the traffic, at all the activity, at the vast intricate anthill of humanity going everywhere and nowhere. \nCHUCK Take your time. \nSTAN What? \nCHUCK That's what it's about. \nSTAN Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it. \nHe swerves into another lane. \nCHUCK Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it. \nSTAN Deep, real deep. \nHe grins, cuts across to the exit. \nSTAN So where to?  The office?  The hotel? The beach? \nChuck stares at him.  Are you kidding? \nSTAN What, then? \nCHUCK Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno. \nSTAN (re: the package) You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do. \nCHUCK I need to do it. \nSTAN Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you. \nRight. \nCHUCK You want to help, help me find the woman who sent this. \nINT.  OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY \nStan and Chuck are in the office of a TECHNICIAN who is working away at his computer.  The Technician pulls the bar code from the Angel Wing FedEx box up on his computer screen. \nTECHNICIAN Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is. (gestures at computer map) Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L. \nCHUCK What about the sender? \nTECHNICIAN Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check. \nHe works some keys, waits. \nTECHNICIAN Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account. \nCHUCK Can you find her? \nTECHNICIAN You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it. \nSTAN I do. \nHe holds out a badge. \nTECHNICIAN Okay, let's let it rip. \nHe starts to pull up the data. \nCHUCK Thanks.  For everything. \nSTAN No sweat. \nEXT.  CHUCK'S MOTEL - THAT NIGHT \nChuck leaves the motel, the Angel Box under his arm.  He ties it into a pannier on the side of a bicycle. \nEXT.  MEMPHIS - CHICKASAW GARDENS - NIGHT \nChuck sneaks up to a craftsman cottage and stands by a tree with a swing on it.  Inside we see Kelly making dinner for her husband, who plays with their daughter.  For a moment Chuck watches through the window, and we watch with him. Then the dog begins to bark. \nEXT.  CEMETERY - NIGHT \nChuck walks through the cemetery late at night.  He comes to his gravestone, stares for a long moment at the inscription, then takes out a spray can of paint and puts a HANDPRINT on it. \nHe gets back on his bicycle and rides away. \nEXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY \nChuck rides his bicycle down a road leading into the South. \nEXT.  FREEWAY - DAY \nChuck pulls some clothes out of his saddle bags. \nEXT.  GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck emerges from the restroom wearing a FedEx shirt and shorts. \nEXT.  BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER \nA classic beach house.  Sand dunes, stilts.  Carrying the Angel Wing Box under his arm, Chuck checks the address in his hand.  Mounts the steps.  A light mist falls.  You can see the Gulf behind the house, gray and moody. \nA WOMAN, BETTINA, answers the door -- THE woman from the beginning.  She wears cut-off jeans and a blue work shirt covered with paint.  There's a tattoo on her ankle. \nCHUCK FedEx for Bettina Peterson. \nThe woman stares in disbelief at the package she hasn't seen in years and never expected to see again. \nBETTINA Where did you get that? \nChuck displays a FedEx badge. \nCHUCK Charles Noland.  FedEx Special Projects. \nBettina notices Chuck's bicycle. \nBETTINA You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late. \nCHUCK There was an unavoidable delay. \nBettina stares at the package, her own memories coming back. \nBETTINA Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up. \nCHUCK No. \nShe holds the box and studies him for a long moment. Something -- the look on his face, the extraordinary reappearance of this long-lost package -- makes her curious. \nBETTINA You know what happened to this? \nCHUCK As much as anybody. \nBETTINA Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute. \nCHUCK Okay.  Sure. \nShe lets Chuck in the door. \nINT.  HOUSE - DAY \nLadders.  Scaffolds.  Huge paintings are everywhere. Paintings of wings and angels -- like the package.  Chuck stares at them.  Bettina watches Chuck stare. \nBETTINA I've got some coffee on.  Would you like some? \nINT.  KITCHEN - LATER \nBettina pours some coffee.  The package sits in the counter. Some magazines are spread around, including a People Magazine with Chuck's photograph on the cover. \nCHUCK (takes a sip) It's good. \nThey smile awkwardly at each other.  She starts to open it. \nBETTINA Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet. \nCHUCK Possible.  So you did those wings? \nBETTINA Yeah.  A long time ago. \nCHUCK They're harder to do than they look. \nBETTINA Oh?  You've tried? \nCHUCK Well, I do a little drawing -- \nShe's opened the package.  She pulls out the bottles of salsa and the letter. \nCHUCK Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient. \nBETTINA He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him. \nThere is a moment where neither knows what to say. \nBETTINA You look familiar. \nHer eyes start to register recognition.  She glances at the magazine with Chuck's picture on it.  She picks it up. \nBETTINA I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly. \nCHUCK Well, not really, I -- \nBETTINA You are.  Yes you are. (so many things she wants to say) What gave you the idea to paint on that cave? \nChuck thinks about that.  After a moment, he grins. \nCHUCK To tell you the truth -- you did. \nBETTINA Do you...have any more packages to deliver? \nCHUCK No.  that was the last one. \nBETTINA Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch. \nChuck sits back on the couch, taking in the sight of the ocean in the light rain.  He looks over at all the canvases, the easel, the palettes.  The wind rustles the palm trees around the house.  The surf crashes and rustles.  Familiar sounds.  Island sounds. \nHe relaxes a little.  Maybe the package with the wings was a sign, he kept it all these years precisely for this.  Then there's a sound of a truck in the driveway. \n", "test1_input": "Chuck walks down the beach, picking up FedEx packages, leaving a trail of footprints in the sand.  Ahead of him we notice a package decorated with ANGEL WINGS. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT MORNING \nChuck has made a neat stack of FedEx boxes under some palm trees at the rim of the beach.  He examines the Angel Wing drawing with passing curiosity, then puts it on the stack. \nChuck takes off his life jacket, sits down in the shade, makes himself comfortable, and waits. \nEXT.  BEACH - SUNSET \nChuck is still waiting.  He's a systems man, and the system isn't working. \nCHUCK All right, guys.  I'm here.  Check the GPS, get moving. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT \nThe full moon shines a ghostly light on the beach.  Trees cast moon-shadows on the sand.  Chuck seems very, very alone. \nWe HEAR from the dark thickets a STRANGE NOISE.  Rustling in the leaves.  Something crashing in the trees, or is it a wave?  A jolt of adrenaline courses through Chuck's body.  He lurches to his feet. \nWe HEAR the noises again.  Chuck edges toward the rocks at the barb of the hook.  Keeping his eye on the thicket, he bends down and picks up a stone.  His first weapon. \nIn the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood.  He picks it up in his other hand.  He backs between two rocks and stands facing the thicket, every sense alert.  A cloud passes over the moon.  The shadow streaks across Chuck's anxious face. \nEXT.  BEACH - MORNING \nThe morning TIDE is coming in.  We follow the tide as it laps amidst the rocks and finds Chuck, staring out to sea.  The empty sea. \nCHUCK Where the fuck are you? \nBut now he is really thirsty.  We WALK with Chuck up the beach. \nBeneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts.  He picks one of them up and studies it.  It's heavy, almost the size of a volleyball.  How to get in it? \nHe throws it down on a rock.  The coconut just bounces off. He wedges the coconut between two rocks, then throws a rock down on it.  It bounces off.  He throws down a bigger rock. It smashes on the rocks and chips.  Chuck picks up the rock. OW!  Where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp.  It cuts him. \nCHUCK Sonofabitch. \nThe blood stains the rock a bright red.  Chuck sucks on his finger, then he gets an idea -- the same idea primitive man first got when he discovered stone tools. \nHe picks up the rock, test the edge.  Sharp -- really sharp. He throws another rock down, but it doesn't break.  He picks up another rock and strikes the first one.  Then again, harder.  And again.  A large flake shoots off.  This edge is even sharper. \nHe has a knife. \nOPENING THE COCONUT - SERIES OF SHOTS \nChuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut.  No luck. \nChuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock. \nChuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut, but the stick slides off, sending the coconut rolling away. \nChuck positions the stick, pointed end up, in a hole, then SLAMS the coconut down hard on it.  Success!  The green nut of the coconut splits.  The brown inner nut is free!  He smashes the nut with a rock, but -- OW!  -- he hits his hand! Chuck licks his fingers, but he is so thirsty there's no more saliva.  He smashes again.  The shell breaks to smithereens. Coconut milk splashes everywhere. \nCHUCK That was smart, really smart. \nRotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving his fingers out of the way, he SMASHES the nut again.  The shell splits!  The precious liquid splashes out.  Left inside is a swallow or two, which Chuck laps up eagerly.  The milky white liquid dribbles down his face. \nCHUCK Ahhh. \nEXT.  BEACH - SUNRISE \nChuck squints at the ocean.  His sunburn is bad -- his lips are cracked.  A stack of broken coconut shells is beside him. No one's there -- again. \nCHUCK Maybe the GPS malfunctioned.  That Korean airliner did. \nClouds scud in front of the sun.  Beyond the reef the waves are high and churning.  Chuck can see them pound onto the reef. \nCHUCK Okay, do the math.  Maybe they know where you are within, say 500 miles.  That's a circle with an area of, uh, pi r squared. So, uh, 250,000 times three point one four, that's about 800,000 square miles. Three times the size of Texas. \nThis sinks in.  Then Chuck gets an idea. \nCHUCK They could use a satellite. \nBut even that doesn't give him much hope. \nCHUCK Say each satellite photo is 30 feet square, that's uh...fuck it...billions and billions of photos. \nThat sinks in. \nCHUCK Aw, someone will come. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT \nChuck sleeps by the coconuts.  The tide is coming in.  Chuck stirs, gets up, staggers over to a palm tree to relieve himself. \nHe stares idly out at the moonlight on the waves.  Then not so idly.  Something's out there, something floating on the tide. \nCHUCK What the hell? \nEXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck splashes into the gentle surf, reaches the dark object. \nIt's a body.  Chuck turns it over.  It's Al, one of the pilots, his face gray and waterlogged and very dead. \nCHUCK Oh Jesus. \nEXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck drags the body up on the beach and then collapses, exhausted.  He sits by it, staring at it. \nCHUCK I'm so sorry, Al.  So sorry. \n", "test1_true": "Chuck has almost finished a grave in the sand back of the palm trees.  He's been digging with a piece of driftwood sharpened with his stone knife. \nHe drags the body into the pit.  Stares down at it.  That could be me. \nCHUCK Got to cover Al up. \nHe wants to say more, can't.  He scoops some sand over the body. \nCHUCK Got to cover Al up. \nHe scoops in some more sand.  It's eerily like burying the tropical fish in his back yard. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER \nWith a rock Chuck hammers a crude driftwood marker into the sand. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY \nAs Chuck sits on the beach, he half-sings, half-talks \"Yellow Submarine\" very quietly to himself. \nCHUCK We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine... \nHe looks over at the deep woods and down to the rocky point. Comes to a decision.  He takes a drink of coconut, picks up his club and a coconut, sticks the stone knife in his pants. He's ready to go. \nEXT.  BEACH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck climbs over the rocks and disappears out of sight. He's still half-singing to himself. \nCHUCK Yellow submarine.  We all live in a yellow submarine... \nEXT.  ISLAND - DAY - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck's way is blocked by rocks and jungle.  He hesitates. He picks up a rock and THROWS IT to scare away all those bad things.  It crashes into the ferns and palm trees.  He takes a step into the jungle. \nEXT.  JUNGLE - MINUTES LATER \nChuck struggles through a dense thicket beneath a jungle canopy.  Vines and creepers reach out toward him.  There is no path, nothing to show him where to go. \nEXT.  JUNGLE - HALF HOUR LATER \nChuck climbs through a tangle of vines and ferns.  He takes a drink from the coconut he is carrying.  The last drink. \nCHUCK Bad idea.  Should have saved some. \nHe throws away the husk.  He looks up, but the only sunlight reaching him is dappled from the canopy above him. \nEXT.  ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck emerges onto a ridge that leads to a summit.  He climbs across a rocky lava field covered with scrub lichen and low ferns, soil dark as coffee beans, his way crossed by steep gullies that cut like dark fingers into the lava. \nThe lava field narrows, forcing Chuck closer to the sea.  He passes a series of CAVES, their mouths dark and mysterious and scary.  He gives them a wide berth. \nEXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER \nThe land narrows to a ledge that stretches across a high cliff perched over the ocean.  Beyond this rock bridge the path smoothes out to a summit. \nChuck stares at the narrow bridge, then down at the waves breaking on the rocks far below.  To get any view, he will have to cross the bridge.  He's thirsty.  The late afternoon sun is hot. \nCHUCK Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play? \nHugging the wall of the cliff, taking each step with great caution, he sets out across the bridge. \nEXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF \nStep by step, Chuck negotiates the narrow bridge.  He reaches a flume of polished basalt which cuts across the ledge like a slide in a water park -- except this flume ends high above the waves.  Chuck tries to step across it, can't quite, tries one foot first, then the other. \nCHUCK Shit! \nHe looks back, but that seems even scarier. \nCHUCK Got to get there.  Got to see.  C'mon... c'mon.  Don't be such a wuss.  Be bold. \nHe looks down at the ocean beneath him, closes his eyes, and jumps.  It's only a few feet, but he's breathing hard when he lands on the other side.  He hugs the rocks, getting his breath. \nEXT.  ISLAND SUMMIT - SUNSET - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck looks to each point on the compass.  He is on an ISLAND, small, inhospitable, without sign of habitation or anything human.  On three sides the waves break against steep, hostile cliffs.  A reef encloses the cove where he came from. \nCHUCK No way on.  No way off. \nChuck stares out to sea in every direction.  Nothing. \nCHUCK This is bad.  Really, really bad. \nThe last rays of sun hit his face.  The ocean turns a deep reddish gold. \nEXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER \nGoing down is even scarier.  It's dusk and the light is flat and gray.  Chuck stares at the ledge. \nCHUCK Come on.  Crawl if you have to. \nChuck crawls on his hands and knees across the rock bridge. \nEXT.  ROCKY SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck stumbles over the rocks.  The caves look ominous and primal. \nEXT.  EDGE OF JUNGLE - NIGHT \nIt's getting dark now.  The jungle seems impenetrable, the dark wood of fable.  Chuck hesitates, then plunges into it. \nEXT.  JUNGLE - NIGHT MINUTES LATER \n", "test1_id": 1458, "test2_input": "BADCHUCK No. \nGOODCHUCK Take it, damn it. \nBADCHUCK No. \nGOODCHUCK Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water. \nSlowly Chuck gets up, lifts up the water jar, and takes a swallow.  Then another. \nGOODCHUCK Stop.  Enough. \nThen another. \nEXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER \nChuck works to braid a new rope.  He is focused, concentrating as hard as he can, but everything is slow and hard and he's weak and clumsy.  He tests the rope, but it doesn't hold. \nGOODCHUCK Think.  Got to use something else. \nHe gets an idea, starts to pull the signal kite in. \nBADCHUCK If they can't see you, what's the point? \nGOODCHUCK Survive today, that's the point. \nThe kite rope is much thinner than the rope he had used to tie the logs, but it's all he has.  He ties the log with the kite rope.  Exhausted, he lies back down. \nEXT.  RAFT - NIGHT \nThe moon is full.  The waves cast off shadows on the ocean. Chuck is staring into the sky, trying to find a star to navigate by. \nGOODCHUCK Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south. \nBADCHUCK You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes. \nGOODCHUCK Moon's too bright. \nWe hear the fraying sound again. \nEXT.  RAFT - DAY \nChuck saws at the outer log with his stone knife.  Across the water comes a storm.  We can see it like a waterfall moving toward us. \nBADCHUCK You're putting off the inevitable. \nGOODCHUCK I'm putting it off. \nHe looks at the deteriorating rope, at the rotting sail. \nBADCHUCK That's what's happening to you. \nChuck pushes the outer log away, then takes the loose rope and begins to lash it around the center logs. \nBADCHUCK You're rotting away. \nThe raft is rocking.  The waves are stronger.  It's hard to tie the logs together. \nRain falls like a sheet on Chuck. \nBADCHUCK Get water! \nGOODCHUCK Fix raft first. \nBADCHUCK Water water water -- \nChuck works frantically in the rain, trying to tie the rope. Finally he does. \nThen he scrambles for his water collecting funnel, struggles to pull it up.  One corner is stuck and collapses. Desperately he rights it, pulls the funnel up. \nDrops begin to run down the sides and collect in the jar. Soaked, Chuck stares at the water as it rises. \nThen the rain stops. \nWe see the line of rain recede away from Chuck, spattering the ocean.  But all around him the ocean is calm again. \nAnd out comes the sun. \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nThe raft floats on quiet seas.  The sky is blue, with few high cirrus clouds so motionless they seem pasted on. \nChuck lies on the raft, sick and weak. \nSuddenly, from the depths beside him, silently rises a huge shape. \nA SPERM WHALE, still mainly submerged.  The blow hole is near Chuck, wet and pulsing like giant lips.  The eye of the whale is only a few feet away.  It looks upon Chuck out of an intelligence deep and alien. \nHe slowly comes to his knees and stares at it. \nThe blow hole opens and WHOOSH, out shoots a geyser of fine spray which settles on Chuck in a mist. \nThe whale rises farther, dwarfing the raft.  From the whale comes a deep sound like a foghorn. \nStartled, Chuck jumps back, rocking the raft.  He catches himself, slowly reaches out and touches the whale. \nThe whale blows again, drenching Chuck in more spray. \nChuck touches the whale again. \nGOODCHUCK You like that? \nVery slowly it drifts along with the raft. \n", "test2_true": "We look right into the whale's eye.  Beneath the surface we can see the huge jaws open and close. \nGOODCHUCK You're beautiful.  Marry me. \nBADCHUCK You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft. \nVery slowly the whale moves ahead of the raft, its vast body passing Chuck. \nGOODCHUCK No, don't go.  Look, I've got fish. \nChuck rips a fillet off the line and throws it in front of the whale, which ignores it. \nGOODCHUCK Please don't dive.  Please. \nThe whale slowly sinks, then suddenly arches its huge back and heads straight for the bottom. \nFor a moment, all that remains are the flukes, black and vertical against the dark blue sky.  With one swoop, those flukes could destroy Chuck and his raft.  But they don't do anything except slowly sink. \nThen it is gone. \nWe are on Chuck's face as he stares at where the whale had been, the surface marked only by a ring of concentric ripples that reach out and gently rock the raft. \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nChuck checks the water.  It is green and full of floaties. It looks awful.  He takes the jug, puts it to his mouth, and drinks.  Instantly he throws up back into the jug, barely keeps from dropping it. \nBADCHUCK Look what you've done. \nHe dips his hand into the ocean, splashes some sea water on his face, splutters it out, then licks his lips.  He is so thirsty. \nHe looks at the water jug, full now with his own vomit, turns away, begins to work on the sea anchor again. \nBut the work makes him even thirstier.  He looks at the jug again. \nPicks it up.  Takes a long drink. \nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY \nThe fish return.  Chuck gets up with his spear, then puts it down. \nBADCHUCK What are you doing? \nGOODCHUCK Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore. \nBADCHUCK You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die. \nGOODCHUCK Why do they have to die for me? \nBADCHUCK They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen. \nChuck listens.  Doesn't hear anything. \nGOODCHUCK Got to eat. \nChuck picks up the spear, stabs it, misses. \nSuddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear.  It struggles, he scoops it onto the raft, brutally pounds on its head, twists the stone knife into its spine.  The struggling stops. \nChuck looks at the dead fish and begins to sob. \nGOODCHUCK I am so sorry. \nHe cries uncontrollably.  As he cries he cuts off the head, pulls out the eyeballs, and eats each one.  Then he sucks the marrow out of the head. \nThen takes the heart and eats that.  Then eats the liver. \nAs he is chewing, he cuts the meat into strips. \nWhen he is done, he takes the backbone, breaks it, and sucks on it. \nFish scales shine in his hair, blood covers his chest. \nEXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT \nThe raft rocks gently.  Chuck looks up.  The strips of fish are glowing.  So is the deck where he killed the fish. \nHe reaches out to touch the fish strips.  His hand is glowing too. \nCHUCK I'm an angel. \nSuddenly he sees other lights.  A ship.  A ship is out there. And he hears it, a humming in deep register. \nHe waves his hands.  He yells. \nCHUCK Here!  Here! \nHis voice cracks, we can barely hear it over the ocean. \nThe lights move on. \nCHUCK No...no...no... \nHis raft is rocked by the wake, rocked hard.  Chuck is thrown into the water! \nHe comes to the surface, sputtering.  Where is the raft? \nHe looks one way, then another.  Darkness. \nThis is the worst. \nHe turns again in the water.  There, dimly, he can see the glow from the fish he killed.  The glow saves his life. \nHe swims toward it. \n", "test2_id": 1459, "test3_input": "TECHNICIAN But would he hear of me driving him around?  Not on your bloody life.  Rinse please. \nChuck does.  Stan bursts into the room. \nSTAN Chuck!  God damn! \nChuck struggles out of the chair. \nSTAN God damn.  God damn.  God damn. \nThey are both almost overcome.  Stan holds Chuck by the shoulders and looks at him. \nSTAN You're alive, you're fucking alive! \nChuck laughs, thrilled to see Stan. \nCHUCK I beat the odds! \nSTAN You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus! \nTECHNICIAN I still need to floss you. \nStan notices the technician. \nSTAN Hello. \nCHUCK This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack. \nHe says this with an absolute straight face, holding back the laughter with great effort.  Instantly there's this connection again between him and Stan. \nTECHNICIAN Ex-boyfriend. \nSTAN Really. \nAnd he and Chuck make eye contact and we see a glimpse of their shared unspoken irony. \nSTAN Uh, there's somebody out here who wants to see you. \nChuck stares sharply at him.  Kelly?  Stan nods, but there's something he wants to say. \nSTAN She thought you were dead.  We all did. \nThat's not all Stan wants to say.  But Chuck is limping out the door. \nINT.  DENTIST - WAITING ROOM \nTypical dentist waiting room.  Chairs, tropical fish tanks, magazines, a few waiting patients...and Kelly, looking nervous. \nSlowly and painfully Chuck enters.  He's quite a sight.  She stands up.  There's a long moment where they look at each other. \nThen she comes into his arms.  Holds him tight.  She's part laughing, part crying. \nKELLY I'm sorry... I'm sorry... \nCHUCK Hey...hey...it's okay! \nChuck is happy, he's still riding the high. \nKELLY You're so thin.  Am I hurting you? \nWell, maybe a little, but who cares?  He hasn't been hugged or barely touched in so long. \nCHUCK No...no...feels good... \nShe disengages, looks at him with that old smile. \nKELLY Right back, you said you'd be right back. \nCHUCK A few things came up.  Or went down. \nHe meets her gaze, looks her over with a smile. \nCHUCK You look...wonderful.  I like your hair. \nHe notices the ring on her hand. \nKELLY I got married. \nCHUCK I thought you might have. \nKELLY I would never -- \nCHUCK I know. \nKELLY If I'd known you were alive -- \nCHUCK I would have done the same thing. \nHis responses come so quick.  Chuck seems blissfully sure of himself. \nKELLY I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess. \nCHUCK You have any children? \nKelly nods. \nCHUCK Got a picture? \nKelly fishes for a photo, shows it to Chuck.  It's a little girl with a dog. \nKELLY Her name's Hannah. \nCHUCK Is that Jango? \n", "test3_true": "Chuck laughs.  It is funny, sort of. \nCHUCK Life's just one big joke after another. \nStan appears, takes in the scene.  The few patients waiting are edged into the corners, trying to look occupied with something else. \nSTAN How about we go somewhere else? \nCHUCK Want to see my raft? \nEXT.  HAWAII - DAY \nChuck's raft sits up on a dock.  Kelly stands staring at it. How small and fragile it looks. \nSTAN This stinks really bad. \nCHUCK You should have smelled me. \nStan examines the ropes around the logs. \nSTAN Cool ropes. \nCHUCK I braided them. \nSTAN Must have taken a hell of a long time. \nCHUCK Time I had lots of. \nKelly points at something on the raft. \nKELLY What's that? \nCHUCK That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory. (picks up his still) And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day. \nHe's not feeling sorry for himself.  It's just a fact. \nSTAN You were how long on this? \nCHUCK Forty-three days. \nThey look at the tiny raft.  It speaks for itself. \nKELLY All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me. \nCHUCK Yeah, well...couldn't be helped. \nKelly notices the sail, sees the writing on it. \nKELLY What's that, written on the sail? \nCHUCK My epitaph. \nKelly reads it to herself.  Her eyes are moist. \nCHUCK Bad body chemistry.  Made me a little morbid.  But I'm all over that now. \nAnd he seems really to believe it. \nSTAN I'll be at the car. (to Kelly) Take you to the airport. \nAnd he leaves. \nKELLY I buried you, Chuck.  They had to pry my fingers off your coffin. \nThis interests Chuck to no end. \nCHUCK There was a coffin? \nKELLY Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing. \nCHUCK What was inside? \nKELLY Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted. \nCHUCK That about sums it up. \nKELLY Maybe now's when you tell me about it. \nCHUCK The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am. \nKELLY Yeah? \nCHUCK The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived. \nKELLY Don't overwhelm me with the details. (she smiles remembering) You know how I hate that. \nHe tries to put it into words, isn't quite sure how. \nKELLY (gently) Come on.  Try. \nCHUCK Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last. \nKELLY So simple to say, so hard to do. \nCHUCK Not when you have no choice. \nKelly looks down at the raft.  It's so small. \nKELLY You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something. \nCHUCK I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does. \nHe has something more to say.  She waits. \n", "test3_id": 1460}

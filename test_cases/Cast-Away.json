{"test1_input": "CAST AWAY \nCAST AWAY \nby \nWilliam Broyles \nTHIRD DRAFT \nMarch 13, 1998 \nFADE IN: \nEXT.  MARFA, TEXAS - 1993 - WIDE - DAY \nThe Texas plains, horizon to horizon, nothing but the browns and ochres of earth and the blue and violet of the sky.  The sheer scope of it sinks in:  the blank slate of nature, the absence of man.  On the screen superimpose: \nMARFA, TEXAS, 1993. \nCREDITS BEGIN. \nA plume of dust comes into frame.  The dust is from a TRUCK, orange and white and violet, with \"FedEx\" blazoned across the side. \nThe truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II era Quonset huts and outbuildings.  Around the outbuildings are large sculptures of wood and metal. \nEXT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY \nThe door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties.  Hair pulled back, casual, an artist.  She hands the DRIVER a FedEx BOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS. The Driver has a hand-held computer; a portable printer dangles from his belt. \nThe Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer, prints out a label and sticks it on the Box, ready to go. But something on the box catches her eye.  She wants it back. He glances at his watch.  She draws RINGS around the Wings, uniting them.  She gives the box to the Driver, then hands him a cup of coffee.  They've done this before. \nHe takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck.  He jumps in and heads back onto the plains. \nEXT.  FEDEX OFFICE - MIDLAND/ODESSA - NIGHT - HOURS LATER \nThe Driver jams the distinctive Angel Wing Box on top of a dolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides. A female Loader slaps a large bar code label on the container, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt of rollers onto a larger truck.  The doors of the truck close.  The latch slams down. \nA forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737. \nEXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT SUPERHUB - NIGHT \nThe 737 lands. \nEXT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER \nOne of a seemingly endless line of FedEx planes, our 737 taxis to a gate at the FedEx SUPERHUB.  The Hub is a vast living organism -- loud, complex, overwhelming, as much a symbol of modern life as was the factory in Modern Times. \nFive thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected activity inside three vast hangers brightly lit.  Hundreds of forklifts and cargo-pullers dart about, their headlights crisscrossing like a laser show. \nLoaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT. \nINT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT \nThe forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a LOADING BELT, where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of packages, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them, all shapes and sizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks.  Large mechanical arms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of stations.  The packages surge and move. \nThe Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts, where they're scanned by laser readers.  Picking up speed our Box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts. \nThe Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG. \nEXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT \nA forklift lifts the Container to a door on a giant MD-11. \nINT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT \nA jumbled room jammed with computers and dominated by a HUGE WALL GRAPHIC that charts hundreds of airplanes.  An Operator moves a yellow strip labeled Jumbo 12 across the board. \nEXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nThe giant place touches down in Paris.  The Angel Wing Box moves quickly on another belt and disappears into another CONTAINER, which is loaded onto still another AIRPLANE. \nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG AIRPORT, RUSSIA - NIGHT \nThe plane lands.  The container is unloaded down a belt.  We see our Angel Box.  Directly in front of it is a DENTED BOX. \nINT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE, RUSSIA \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nNight.  The manic activity has come to a dead stop.  Our two Boxes sit on a table in a corner not far from a small Christmas tree. \nDaylight now.  YURI, a Supervisor, saunters over, picks up the Angel Box, sees an attractive co-worker, puts it down. \nNight again.  A cat walks by the table where our two Boxes have come to rest. \nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE - DAY \nA FedEx truck pulls out of the warehouse.  The walls of the warehouse are covered with graffiti.  The streets are slushy, the buildings blanketed in snow. \nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY \nThe Driver sits in the truck drinking tea.  He takes a last sip, sighs, gets out with the Angel Box.  Walks slowly toward an APARTMENT HOUSE. \nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nA beautiful young RUSSIAN WOMAN opens the door.  A young AMERICAN MAN comes up behind her, signs the form and takes the Angel Box.  We see Christmas decorations inside.  The woman puts her arms around him as the door closes. \nRUSSIAN WOMAN (O.S.) (accented English) It's pretty.  Who is it from? \nAMERICAN MAN (O.S.) My wife. \n", "test1_true": "EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Driver has just delivered the Dented Box to ALEKSEI, Russian Businessman, who closes the door of a Czarist-era building.  Aleksei checks his watch, picks up the phone. \nEXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY \nCHUCK NOLAND, early thirties, walks along a line of brightly colored jitneys, each bearing the FedEx logo.  With him is a Filipino FedEx SUPERVISOR wearing a guayabera.  Chuck glistens with a thin layer of sweat. \nCHUCK My guess is we're talking fuel filters here, Fernando.  The gas is dirty, these jitneys get in the mountains, their engines cut out. \nFERNANDO That could lose us half an hour. \nCHUCK Easy.  Each way. \nHis beeper goes off. \nINT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck is on the phone. \nCHUCK So it finally turned up... \nChuck hesitates for a moment, then looks at his watch. \nCHUCK I'll catch the sweep tonight. \nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT \nStrapped into the jump seat behind the pilots, Chuck sleeps with a mask over his eyes.  On his lap are some travel brochures.  We see sailboats, we see the Florida keys. \nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICES - DAY \nChristmas in Russia.  Snow everywhere.  Brightly colored lights.  Chucks gets out of a Volga with Aleksei.  He has a bag over his shoulder, the dented package under one arm. \nINT.  FEDEX OFFICES - DAY \nThe staff has assembled near the loading dock.  Yuri the station manager stands in front, occasionally catching the eye of the attractive woman.  Chuck displays the FedEx box. \nCHUCK It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what -- \nALEKSEI Six kilometers.  Four miles. \nCHUCK So how are we going to get this place shaped up? \nThere's a muttered chorus of answers. \nCHUCK There's only one way.  We have to work together.  Every one of us depends on everyone else.  If one package is late, we are all late.  If one truck misses the deadline, we all miss the deadline. Let's start by taking a look around. \nChuck leads his team through the sorting area.  Yuri squeezes right next to him, ostentatiously carrying a clipboard. Chuck stops. \nCHUCK Here, this table is too far from the wall.  Packages can slip down...like... (pulls out a package from behind a table) ...this. \nHe hefts the package, as if trying to guess what's inside. \nCHUCK What could be in here?  Let's say one of you sent it.  Could be the closing papers on your dacha, could be a toy for your grandson's birthday, could be a kidney to keep your mother alive.  I don't think you want your mother's kidney to end up behind a table. \nThe Sorter shoves the table against the wall.  Yuri says something to the Translator. \nTRANSLATOR He says they have been very busy.  It is hard to get good employees.  He is sure you understand. \nWrong answer:  Chuck glances sharply at Yuri.  Aleksei appears with a cellular phone. \nALEKSEI Phone call.  Malaysia. \nChuck takes the phone, opening his BAG as he does so. \nCHUCK Kamal?  Right.  I'm getting them. \nHe pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletin board as he talks. \nCHUCK I'm looking at the blueprints of K.L. right now.  The belts are too small for the sorters.  Yeah, sometimes you never see what's right in front of your face. Look, it's -- \nChuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse. Then he notices something over by one of the trucks. \nCHUCK (to a loader) Hold it!  Hazardous material needs its own container! (back on the phone) -- three in the afternoon there, right? That gives you five hours until the sweep comes through.  Do the sort by hand tonight, then put in a new feeder belt, say a twenty-four incher.  Yes, overtime is authorized. \nHe hangs up the phone.  He turns to the crew. \nCHUCK I'm going out on every route, I'm going to work every job here, until I know enough to help you.  That's it. \nThe crew disperses back to work.  Chuck and Aleksei walk toward the office.  They've done this before.  Chuck lets a corner of his command persona slip. \nALEKSEI It's bad. \nCHUCK Worse than Warsaw. \nALEKSEI Nobody remembers that. \nCHUCK The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget. \nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY - MOMENTS LATER \nA FedEx truck pulls out of the FedEx office.  Chuck is inside.  He notices the graffiti on the walls. \nINT.  TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck rides next to LEV, the driver, a serious sort.  The Translator squats on some boxes between them, trying to keep his balance. \nCHUCK You sorted your packages before you left. None of the other drivers did. \nThe Translator and Lev exchange a few words. \nTRANSLATOR He says he wants to be organized.  Do packages in order. \n", "test1_id": 1458, "test2_input": "CHUCK Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us? \nVOICE (SQUAWK BOX) Kamal is not here. \nCHUCK Who is this?  Where is Kamal? \nVOICE (SQUAWK BOX) It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter. \nCHUCK What's going on down there? \nVOICE (SQUAWK BOX) Kamal is not here.  We are very defused. \nCHUCK Who's in charge then, where is Chinn? \nThe squawk box hums and crackles.  Nothing.  Chuck turns to the Technician. \nSTAN We got Telex, e-mail? \nTECHNICIAN Sure.  Just not getting any answers. \nChuck turns to Leslie. \nCHUCK When's the next Jumbo? \nLESLIE The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow. \nCHUCK Anything else? \nLESLIE There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney. \nSTAN Maybe you should get your ducks lined up first. \nChuck looks over at Stan. \nCHUCK Call Operations.  Get me on it. \nAnd Stan is impressed. \nEXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - DAY \nChuck leaves with his bag over his shoulder and the puppy under his arm. \nEXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - DAY - MINUTES LATER \nKelly opens the door.  Chuck is there with the puppy. \nKELLY That's your dog. \nCHUCK It's our dog.  It belongs to us. \nKELLY There isn't any us. \nCHUCK Yes there is. \nKelly can't stay mad. \nKELLY I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away. \nCHUCK No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill -- \nKELLY I burned the Christmas tree. \nShe's half-laughing, half-wanting-to-cry. \nKELLY Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was. \nCHUCK I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt. \nKELLY What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now. \nCHUCK Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back. \nKELLY Don't even start. \nAnd then it hits her. \nKELLY Get back?  From where? \nCHUCK Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep. \nShe stares at him for a long moment, then at the puppy. \nKELLY Give him to me. \nHe hands her the dog. \nKELLY Chuck, you're breaking my heart. \nCHUCK A week, max.  Okay?  Okay? \nKELLY Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs. \nShe kisses the puppy. \nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT \nChuck enters the cockpit, where two different pilots are going through their checklists.  Chuck repeats his familiar patter. \nCHUCK Al -- gotta be something wrong with our physicals, you keep getting certified to fly.  John, aren't you worried? \nJOHN I disconnected his controls.  He only thinks he's flying. \nChuck settles into his seat. \n", "test2_true": "Al has an Australian accent. \nAL Right.  Down home, down under. \nCHUCK We're on time, right? \nAL On time, Chuck. \nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT - HOURS LATER \nSettled into the jump seat, Chuck finishes up his notes on his PowerBook and begins his flight ritual. \nHe puts in his ear plugs and takes out his Valium.  He swallows one, then thinks, and swallows two more.  Then he turns on his Walkman to the Rolling Stones, puts the mask over his eyes, and, as usual, goes to sleep. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT \nThe plane is SHAKING badly.  HEAR frantic, garbled radio talk.  Chuck stirs, struggles to his feet, drowsy and drugged. \nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK'S POV \nEverything is hazy, out of focus, as it was in his earlier drugged condition.  But this is real haze.  SMOKE.  And the cabin also TWISTS and TILTS. \nChuck tries to steady himself against the wall.  This is nightmarish.  Is this really happening? \nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK'S POV - COCKPIT \nThe pilots wrestle with the controls.  They have their life jackets on.  John glances back at Chuck, his face floating in a cloud of fear. \nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck struggles to put on his life jacket.  The plane is VIBRATING VIOLENTLY.  He can't get the straps straight.  He is KNOCKED against one wall, then another, then to the floor. \nChuck tries to blow on the mouth tubes for his life jacket. Can't do it!  Puff.  Puff.  Shit!  John motions frantically for Chuck to pull on the automatic inflators on his jacket. Chuck fumbles for them. \nHuge palettes shift and groan, one BREAKS FREE, banging violently against the side of the plane, spilling out its boxes.  Then it swings and KNOCKS Chuck on the head!  He goes down! \nINT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER \nA CONTROLLER mans the global operations desk.  His SUPERVISOR stands behind him, sipping some coffee.  The mood is eerily calm.  An assistant moves Plane Locator Cards on a giant board. \nCONTROLLER Jumbo 14 is overdue in Sector K. \nSUPERVISOR Where are they? \nAnother CONTROLLER tracks a giant computer screen. \nCONTROLLER 2 Somewhere east of Port Moresby.  Guam is getting a signal but no location.  Maybe the GPS is out. \nThe signal flashes, but is strangely still compared to the others, which are moving. \nEXT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT \nThe giant plane PLUMMETS down from the sky. \nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT \nChuck is semi-conscious and bleeding from the head.  John pulls the inflators on Chuck's life jacket, which fills with a WHOOSH!, sending Chuck's arms out to the sides.  Al struggles with the LIFE RAFT.  It's all blurred, frantic, terrifying. \nEXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER \nThe plane hits the ocean with a CRASH and a WAVE of water. \nINT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Controller is speaking mechanically into the microphone. \nCONTROLLER Guam, I need a fix on Jumbo 14. \nEXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT \nShrouded with fog and surrounded by debris, the tail of the big plane slowly SINKS beneath the angry, storm-driven waves. \nEXT.  PACIFIC - DAY \nA life raft is tossed on dark, storm-driven seas.  Inside it, semi-conscious, Chuck hangs on. \nEXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT \nWe catch glimpses of the yellow lift raft in the dark as the storm continues. \nEXT.  BEACH - EARLY MORNING \nThe storm has ended.  Waves lap gently on a beach cut like a scallop out of a rocky shore.  On the beach we see scattered FEDEX BOXES.  And we see, face-down, half-buried in sand, a MAN IN A SUIT and a life jacket. \nChuck. \nThe tide gently rocks him, laps at his face.  He chokes. Slowly he gets to his knees.  Vomits seawater, big heaves. He rolls over, sits down.  Dazed.  Still confused.  Where am I?  What happened? \nChuck's first instinct is to check the time.  He looks at his watch, taps it in frustration. \nThen he looks around, and we look with him. \nCHUCK'S POV - BEACH \nThe fog has thinned.  We can see palm groves and mangrove thickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing up a steep, rocky hillside.  The rocks on the opposite point end in a barren ridge.  Clouds hide the top of the hill. \nON CHUCK \nas he takes in his surroundings.  He licks his lips.  He's thirsty.  But something he sees is even more important.  We stay with him as he WALKS.  He comes to a FEDEX PACKAGE in the sand, picks it up, brushes off the sand, walks farther. He picks up another package. \nEXT.  BEACH - WIDE \n", "test2_id": 1459, "test3_input": "Chuck walks down the beach, picking up FedEx packages, leaving a trail of footprints in the sand.  Ahead of him we notice a package decorated with ANGEL WINGS. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT MORNING \nChuck has made a neat stack of FedEx boxes under some palm trees at the rim of the beach.  He examines the Angel Wing drawing with passing curiosity, then puts it on the stack. \nChuck takes off his life jacket, sits down in the shade, makes himself comfortable, and waits. \nEXT.  BEACH - SUNSET \nChuck is still waiting.  He's a systems man, and the system isn't working. \nCHUCK All right, guys.  I'm here.  Check the GPS, get moving. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT \nThe full moon shines a ghostly light on the beach.  Trees cast moon-shadows on the sand.  Chuck seems very, very alone. \nWe HEAR from the dark thickets a STRANGE NOISE.  Rustling in the leaves.  Something crashing in the trees, or is it a wave?  A jolt of adrenaline courses through Chuck's body.  He lurches to his feet. \nWe HEAR the noises again.  Chuck edges toward the rocks at the barb of the hook.  Keeping his eye on the thicket, he bends down and picks up a stone.  His first weapon. \nIn the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood.  He picks it up in his other hand.  He backs between two rocks and stands facing the thicket, every sense alert.  A cloud passes over the moon.  The shadow streaks across Chuck's anxious face. \nEXT.  BEACH - MORNING \nThe morning TIDE is coming in.  We follow the tide as it laps amidst the rocks and finds Chuck, staring out to sea.  The empty sea. \nCHUCK Where the fuck are you? \nBut now he is really thirsty.  We WALK with Chuck up the beach. \nBeneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts.  He picks one of them up and studies it.  It's heavy, almost the size of a volleyball.  How to get in it? \nHe throws it down on a rock.  The coconut just bounces off. He wedges the coconut between two rocks, then throws a rock down on it.  It bounces off.  He throws down a bigger rock. It smashes on the rocks and chips.  Chuck picks up the rock. OW!  Where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp.  It cuts him. \nCHUCK Sonofabitch. \nThe blood stains the rock a bright red.  Chuck sucks on his finger, then he gets an idea -- the same idea primitive man first got when he discovered stone tools. \nHe picks up the rock, test the edge.  Sharp -- really sharp. He throws another rock down, but it doesn't break.  He picks up another rock and strikes the first one.  Then again, harder.  And again.  A large flake shoots off.  This edge is even sharper. \nHe has a knife. \nOPENING THE COCONUT - SERIES OF SHOTS \nChuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut.  No luck. \nChuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock. \nChuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut, but the stick slides off, sending the coconut rolling away. \nChuck positions the stick, pointed end up, in a hole, then SLAMS the coconut down hard on it.  Success!  The green nut of the coconut splits.  The brown inner nut is free!  He smashes the nut with a rock, but -- OW!  -- he hits his hand! Chuck licks his fingers, but he is so thirsty there's no more saliva.  He smashes again.  The shell breaks to smithereens. Coconut milk splashes everywhere. \nCHUCK That was smart, really smart. \nRotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving his fingers out of the way, he SMASHES the nut again.  The shell splits!  The precious liquid splashes out.  Left inside is a swallow or two, which Chuck laps up eagerly.  The milky white liquid dribbles down his face. \nCHUCK Ahhh. \nEXT.  BEACH - SUNRISE \nChuck squints at the ocean.  His sunburn is bad -- his lips are cracked.  A stack of broken coconut shells is beside him. No one's there -- again. \nCHUCK Maybe the GPS malfunctioned.  That Korean airliner did. \nClouds scud in front of the sun.  Beyond the reef the waves are high and churning.  Chuck can see them pound onto the reef. \nCHUCK Okay, do the math.  Maybe they know where you are within, say 500 miles.  That's a circle with an area of, uh, pi r squared. So, uh, 250,000 times three point one four, that's about 800,000 square miles. Three times the size of Texas. \nThis sinks in.  Then Chuck gets an idea. \nCHUCK They could use a satellite. \nBut even that doesn't give him much hope. \nCHUCK Say each satellite photo is 30 feet square, that's uh...fuck it...billions and billions of photos. \nThat sinks in. \nCHUCK Aw, someone will come. \nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT \nChuck sleeps by the coconuts.  The tide is coming in.  Chuck stirs, gets up, staggers over to a palm tree to relieve himself. \nHe stares idly out at the moonlight on the waves.  Then not so idly.  Something's out there, something floating on the tide. \nCHUCK What the hell? \nEXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck splashes into the gentle surf, reaches the dark object. \nIt's a body.  Chuck turns it over.  It's Al, one of the pilots, his face gray and waterlogged and very dead. \nCHUCK Oh Jesus. \nEXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck drags the body up on the beach and then collapses, exhausted.  He sits by it, staring at it. \nCHUCK I'm so sorry, Al.  So sorry. \n", "test3_true": "Chuck has almost finished a grave in the sand back of the palm trees.  He's been digging with a piece of driftwood sharpened with his stone knife. \nHe drags the body into the pit.  Stares down at it.  That could be me. \nCHUCK Got to cover Al up. \nHe wants to say more, can't.  He scoops some sand over the body. \nCHUCK Got to cover Al up. \nHe scoops in some more sand.  It's eerily like burying the tropical fish in his back yard. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER \nWith a rock Chuck hammers a crude driftwood marker into the sand. \nEXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY \nAs Chuck sits on the beach, he half-sings, half-talks \"Yellow Submarine\" very quietly to himself. \nCHUCK We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine... \nHe looks over at the deep woods and down to the rocky point. Comes to a decision.  He takes a drink of coconut, picks up his club and a coconut, sticks the stone knife in his pants. He's ready to go. \nEXT.  BEACH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck climbs over the rocks and disappears out of sight. He's still half-singing to himself. \nCHUCK Yellow submarine.  We all live in a yellow submarine... \nEXT.  ISLAND - DAY - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck's way is blocked by rocks and jungle.  He hesitates. He picks up a rock and THROWS IT to scare away all those bad things.  It crashes into the ferns and palm trees.  He takes a step into the jungle. \nEXT.  JUNGLE - MINUTES LATER \nChuck struggles through a dense thicket beneath a jungle canopy.  Vines and creepers reach out toward him.  There is no path, nothing to show him where to go. \nEXT.  JUNGLE - HALF HOUR LATER \nChuck climbs through a tangle of vines and ferns.  He takes a drink from the coconut he is carrying.  The last drink. \nCHUCK Bad idea.  Should have saved some. \nHe throws away the husk.  He looks up, but the only sunlight reaching him is dappled from the canopy above him. \nEXT.  ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck emerges onto a ridge that leads to a summit.  He climbs across a rocky lava field covered with scrub lichen and low ferns, soil dark as coffee beans, his way crossed by steep gullies that cut like dark fingers into the lava. \nThe lava field narrows, forcing Chuck closer to the sea.  He passes a series of CAVES, their mouths dark and mysterious and scary.  He gives them a wide berth. \nEXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER \nThe land narrows to a ledge that stretches across a high cliff perched over the ocean.  Beyond this rock bridge the path smoothes out to a summit. \nChuck stares at the narrow bridge, then down at the waves breaking on the rocks far below.  To get any view, he will have to cross the bridge.  He's thirsty.  The late afternoon sun is hot. \nCHUCK Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play? \nHugging the wall of the cliff, taking each step with great caution, he sets out across the bridge. \nEXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF \nStep by step, Chuck negotiates the narrow bridge.  He reaches a flume of polished basalt which cuts across the ledge like a slide in a water park -- except this flume ends high above the waves.  Chuck tries to step across it, can't quite, tries one foot first, then the other. \nCHUCK Shit! \nHe looks back, but that seems even scarier. \nCHUCK Got to get there.  Got to see.  C'mon... c'mon.  Don't be such a wuss.  Be bold. \nHe looks down at the ocean beneath him, closes his eyes, and jumps.  It's only a few feet, but he's breathing hard when he lands on the other side.  He hugs the rocks, getting his breath. \nEXT.  ISLAND SUMMIT - SUNSET - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck looks to each point on the compass.  He is on an ISLAND, small, inhospitable, without sign of habitation or anything human.  On three sides the waves break against steep, hostile cliffs.  A reef encloses the cove where he came from. \nCHUCK No way on.  No way off. \nChuck stares out to sea in every direction.  Nothing. \nCHUCK This is bad.  Really, really bad. \nThe last rays of sun hit his face.  The ocean turns a deep reddish gold. \nEXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER \nGoing down is even scarier.  It's dusk and the light is flat and gray.  Chuck stares at the ledge. \nCHUCK Come on.  Crawl if you have to. \nChuck crawls on his hands and knees across the rock bridge. \nEXT.  ROCKY SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER \nChuck stumbles over the rocks.  The caves look ominous and primal. \nEXT.  EDGE OF JUNGLE - NIGHT \nIt's getting dark now.  The jungle seems impenetrable, the dark wood of fable.  Chuck hesitates, then plunges into it. \nEXT.  JUNGLE - NIGHT MINUTES LATER \n", "test3_id": 1460}

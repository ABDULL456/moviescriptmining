KAY Floorboard's loose near the closet. Think you could fix it? 
BUCKY (relieved) Sure, babe. 
The phone rings. Bucky answers it. 
BUCKY (cont'd) Hello...Hey Vic... 
Bucky writes something on a piece of paper. Hangs up. 
BUCKY (cont'd) Gotta go. Work-up on a probable gunshot suicide. 
KAY Sounds lovely. Where is it? 
BUCKY Hancock Park. 
EXT. A COLONIAL MANSION - JUNE STREET - MORNING 
Bucky rings the bell. He's dressed plainclothes and carries a technician's canvas bag. 
An attractive woman in her early fifties opens the door. 
WOMAN Yes? 
BUCKY I'm Officer Bleichert. LAPD. My I express my condolences, Mrs.-- 
WOMAN Jane Chambers. Condolences accepted. You're the lab man? 
He nods yes. She lets him in and he follows. 
JANE CHAMBERS It's the study in back of the dining room. You'll see the police rope. If you'll excuse me, I'll be in my garden. 
He notices for the first time she's dressed for gardening. 
INT. THE STUDY - MORNING 
Bucky steps over the police rope and into the study. A large desk chair lies overturned an the ground next to A TAPE OUTLINE OF A BODY. Three feet away lies A SHOTGUN. 
Behind the chair the brown spattering of blood and brains decorates the white wall and crown mouldings. 
CUT TO: 
A SERIES OF SHOTS 
as Bucky measures the splatter marks on the walls, scrapes tissue from the muzzle of the gun, dusts it for latent prints, etc. At the end he wraps the gun in a plastic bag. 
INT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
as Bucky steps over the police rope and walks back towards the main foyer. He stops short. 
ON THE OPPOSING WALL 
hangs a disturbing PAINTING: the portrait of a clown, a young boy done up in court jester's garb. His body is gnarled and hunched. He wears a stuporous ear-to-ear smile that looks like one continuous deep scar. 
It is eerily reminiscent of Elizabeth Short's death wound. 
Spooked, Bucky pulls his eyes away and settles them on nearby family photos--two young women linked arm in arm. 
JANE CHAMBERS The other survivors. Pretty aren't they? 
She arrives next to him, dusty with soil. 
BUCKY Like their mother. How old are they? 
JANE CHAMBERS Twenty-one and twenty-three. Are you finished in the study? 
BUCKY Yes. Tell whoever cleans it up to use pure ammonia... (looking at the two girls) Mrs. Chambers-- 
JANE CHAMBERS Jane. 
BUCKY Jane, do you know Madeleine and Martha Sprague? The next block over? 
JANE CHAMBERS (snorts) Those girls and that family. How do you know them? 
BUCKY I did a little work for them once. 
JANE CHAMBERS Consider it lucky if it was a brief encounter. 
BUCKY How do you mean? 
The hallway phone rings. Jane moves to answer it. 
JANE CHAMBERS Back to condolences. Thank you for being so nice, Mr.-- 
BUCKY Bucky. Good-bye, Jane. 
JANE CHAMBERS Good-bye. 
INT. THE CRIME LAB - LATER 
Bucky writes up a report. VIC pokes his head in. 
VIC You finish working up the suicide, Bucky? 
BUCKY Yeah. Pretty routine. Whattya know about the husband? 
VIC Eldridge Chambers? Widow said he was depressed, failing health. The terrible burden of all that money'll get you every time. 
BUCKY Wonder how he made it? 
VIC No mystery there. Real estate. 
BUCKY Oh really? 
INT. THE GARAGE - EVENING 
The garage door is open to the evening air. Bucky's heavy bag and speed bag hang on hooks. Bucky leans against a stool, a large box open on the work bench. 
INSIDE THE BOX 
Bucky brushes aside a clutter of junk and pulls out A PHOTO ALBUM. He opens it and begins flipping through: articles and photos concerning Elizabeth Short. MOSTLY PHOTOS. 
It's like a man in a mid-life crisis fantasizing about his high school sweetheart. 
OFF ONE OF THE PHOTOS WE DISSOLVE TO: 
ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION 
"Elizabeth Short...Screen Test #5" 
She rambles on, almost oblivious of the camera. 
ELIZABETH SHORT ...I had a fiance, Captain Matt Durand. He was in a tank battalion. A Commander. He had...the fiercest blue eyes. Like the deep water you see from a fishing boat... 
She's lost in thought...we're not sure whether this is a scene, her real life, or just a sad lie... 
THE NOISE OF A CAR APPROACHING 
BACK TO SCENE 
Bucky drops the album back in the box as Kay's car pulls into the driveway. He covers it back up. 
KAY (getting out) What're you doing?

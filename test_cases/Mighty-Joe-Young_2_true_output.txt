REPORTER (V.O.) ... behind me you see the habitat of what experts are calling one of the most important zoological finds of this century. This is the home of what's believed to be the world's largest primate -- a two thousand pound gorilla named Joe. 
We see a shot of Joe, in his habitat, with a conservancy worker in the f.g., for scale. 
REPORTER (V.O.) Joe has been at the California Animal Conservancy for a little more than a month now. He was brought here from Africa by Dr. Gregory O'Hara. According to Dr. O'Hara...

INT. RAHA PRESERVE AND CONSERVANCY (BOTSWANA) - EVENING 
Strasser, in the main room of his preserve, watches the news report, absolutely riveted. He is polishing a leather object that we can't clearly make out.   Garth stands behind him. 
Strasser is on the edge of his seat, watching the screen.

STRASSER (amazed) My God. Pindi was right. 
REPORTER (V.O.) ... Joe's remarkable size made him a natural target for poachers. Fortunately the California Animal Conservancy's program in... 
The program continues with more shots of Joe.     Strasser is overcome with desire. 
STRASSER (transfixed) He's beautiful. The most beautiful animal I have ever seen. 
GARTH And the most valuable, that's for sure. 
STRASSER I want him.   He belongs here with me. 
GARTH (thinking it over) It'll be a bit tricky, won't it? They're not gonna want to part with... 
STRASSER Wait!   Be quiet! 
Strasser points to the television... 
ON TV 
Intercut with shots of Joe are shots of the conservancy staff. Jill is among them, and her look of displeasure with the photographing of Joe makes her stand out from the staff. This shot is replaced with side by side photographs of Jill and her mother, Ruth. 
REPORTER (V.O.) ... was raised from infancy by Jill Young, the daughter of famed primatologist Ruth Young. Their closeness stems from a tragic bond. (MORE)

REPORTER (V.O.CONT'D) Both Joe and Jill's mothers were killed by poachers, twelve years ago, in the Pangani Forest, orphaning them on the same night. 
ON STRASSER 
Emotion surging through him. He realizes now, all at once, exactly who Joe and Jill are. 
GARTH (surprised) Bloody hell. That's the little monster that... 
Garth stops abruptly, glancing at Strasser's hand. He knows better than to mention it directly. Strasser looks down... 
CLOSEUP - STRASSER'S HAND 
tanned, manicured, and missing the thumb and forefinger. The leather he's been polishing this whole time is his prosthetic hand. He straps it back on. 
STRASSER (softly, to himself) I am always amazed how, if you wait long enough, the opportunity for justice finally comes. 
Garth watches his boss, who seems lost in his private dream of revenge. It's a moment before Strasser looks back at him. 
STRASSER Book us two tickets to America. We're going to pay a visit to this incredible animal. 
He looks back at the TV, where Jill is on screen. 
STRASSER I think I know how to convince his current owners to part with him. 
And on that foreboding note...

CLOSE ON the sleepy face of a shaggy yak. PULL BACK TO a small group of V.I.P.s being led on a tour by Harry. 
HARRY This fellow is one of only three hundred wild yaks remaining on the planet. There are those who would ask, why should we care if this sub-species of yak survives? 
We SPOT a man blending in with the group. We recognize Garth. He looks quite respectable in a suit. The antsy V.I.P. next to Garth interrupts Harry. 
V.I.P. #1 Excuse me.   Can we see Joe? 
The other V.I.P.s echo this wish.   Harry refocuses himself. 
HARRY (charming) You certainly can -- for the mere price of a 'Diamond Circle Benefactor Ticket' to tomorrow night's benefit. 
The V.I.P.s laugh and groan. Garth takes this moment to slip away, unnoticed. Harry twinkles at the V.I.P.s. 
HARRY It's all for a good cause. 
68A    EXT. CONSERVANCY GROUNDS - ANOTHER AREA - LATER                68A 
Harry is waving good-bye to the V.I.P.s, who have completed their tour. 
HARRY Good-bye. Good-bye. (under his breath) Throw money... throw money... 
Jill and Cecily drive up in an electric cart. Jill jumps out, wearing a conservancy T-shirt, and from the looks of things she's been working hard in the habitat all day. She's a lovely mess, head to toe.

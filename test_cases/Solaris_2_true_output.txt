The contrast between the cabin's rustic aesthetic and the aggressively high-tech equipment contained therein isn't as jarring as you might imagine. 
Kelvin is seated in front of a desk, scrolling through a text readout on a flat, transparent holographic screen.  Behind him is the Well-Dressed Bureaucrat from the car, and two others: A WOMAN in her 50s and a MAN in his 30s.  They are also well-groomed.  Each of their suits are embroidered with a small but distinctive LOGO of some sort that composes the acronym DBA. 
Kelvin scrolls through several menus, hits a few keys, and a digitized VIDEO IMAGE appears on his screen: A MAN, unshaven, looking into the camera. 
The man, GIBARIAN, looks very tired and somewhat apologetic. The lower part of the screen has a time of day and date display that reads: 0221 HRS 11/14/31. 
GIBARIAN We take off into the cosmos, ready for anything: solitude, hardship, exhaustion, death.  We're proud of ourselves, in a way.  But our enthusiasm is a sham.  We don't want to conquer the cosmos -- we want to extend the boundaries of Earth to the cosmos.  We are only seeking Man.  We don't want Other Worlds.  We want mirrors. (beat) Maybe we don't need to know what it is, or why.  Maybe just knowing that it is should be enough. 
Gibarian stares at the camera for a long moment before switching it off and ending the transmission. 
Kelvin sits back. 
The visitors exchange glances. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  SPACE CAPSULE 
Close on Kelvin.  We hold on him a long time, as a myriad of readouts scroll and flash across his face.  A slit of sunlight glides slowly through frame. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
KELVIN 
in the same capsule, a month later.  He is asleep. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
KELVIN 
in the same capsule, two months later.  He is dictating some coordinates to Earth.  He absently scratches his heavy growth of beard. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
KELVIN 
two months later still.  He is looking out his small, rectangular window, and for the fist time we cut around to see the approaching planet: SOLARIS. 
Kelvin stares at it, hypnotized.  It has a translucent quality, as though it is lit from within, and its undulating, ocean-like surface slowly changes colors. 
Kelvin's attention is diverted as an orbiting ship, the PROMETHEUS, edges into frame. 
KELVIN Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on approach, do you read me? (beat) Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on approach, do you read me? 
No response.  He exhales and types on a keyboard. 
EXT.  SPACE 
The Athena 7, sporting a DBA logo, advances toward the Prometheus. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  PROMETHEUS 
Kelvin, in a space suit, climbs with some difficulty out of the Athena 7, which has come to rest in the DOCKING BAY of the Prometheus.  Several exploratory PODS fill the remainder of the area.

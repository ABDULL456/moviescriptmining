CONTINUED: 
SALESMAN No worries, we make you good deal, no payment til next year. Just try one on for size. You like, we lock in your neural code, plastiform your face, you good to go. THE SALESMAN hits a couple of switches, slips a small SLEEVE over GREER'S FINGER, it's wired to the projector. 
SALESMAN (CONT'D) Take a whirl. Greer touches his fingers together--- his body instantly goes limp and-- -a pale, hairless SURRIE TEMPLATE in a speedo steps out of a CHARGING BAY. Its head is unfinished, a mechanical version of a skinless face. Around its neck is a sign that reads "40% OFF!" 
SALESMAN (CONT'D) Looking gooood. 
40% OFF I dunno... The VOICE is a tinny, far-away sounding version of Greer's. Suddenly 40% OFF twitches and stumbles, bumping into a DISPLAY. 
SALESMAN Try touching your nose. 40% OFF pokes himself in the eye. 
'SALESMAN (CONT'D) Good, good. Takes some time to break in. Base model come with vision, hearing-- other senses optional. 
40% OFF Screw this. The surrie FREEZES in its tracks... and slowly TOPPLES OVER as GREER pulls of the projector headpiece. The SALESMAN sets to righting it, GREER heads for the exit. 
SALESMAN Wait wait wait! I throw in super- sex software package-- fifty percent off!

PETERS We can try a department store-- if money's a problem, I can front 
YOU TILL-- 
GREER No. I'm a grown man for Chrissake, I should be able to walk down the street without completely freaking out. 
INT. BAR - DAY 
A BARTENDER puts a SODA WATER and a GLASS OF SCOTCH on the bar in front of PETERS and the shaky GREER. 
PETERS Well, you made it a block. 
GREER (lifts his glass) Here's to self-medication. He takes a sip and spits it out. The BARTENDER turns. 
BARTENDER Are you all right, sir? 
GREER What is this? The BARTENDER gives him a once-over. 
BARTENDER Oh, sorry. We don't get a lot of-- that's synthohol. Just a CPU inhibition blocker in a non- corrosive solution... As the bartender speaks, Greer looks around the dark bar-- --in the back, EVERY COUPLE is gazing into each other's eyes, clearly hooking up. GREER continues to watch the other patrons. 
GREER You have any real booze? 
BARTENDER No liquor license. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The BARTENDER shrugs and moves off. Peters sips her soda water, amused. 
PETERS Come here often, stranger? 
GREER You know, they really don't look human. You can't tell when you're inside them, but... GREER turns to PETERS, studies her like the others. 
PETERS I don't like the way you're looking at me. 
GREER But I'm not really looking at you. 
PETERS Yeah yeah, this is just a lump of aluminum and polystyrene. Tell you what, next time you're in Colorado, look me up for real. We can have a beer together. 
GREER I'd like that. PETERS blinks, Greer has suddenly gotten sincere on her. He looks away. 
GREER (CONT'D) You know, when we started working together, I thought you were kind of a stiff. 
PETERS New job, I was defensive. 
GREER It's more than that... you're different. Or maybe I am. Greer's embarrassed, shrugs it off. He puts down a bill and rises. 
GREER (CONT'D) You probably oughta head back to the office.

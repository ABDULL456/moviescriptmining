{"train": "As the sun comes up, Langdon and Vincenzo leave the natatorium. \nVINCENZO Yes, of course, but it couldn't be the llluminati as we knew them, they disappeared a hundred years ago. \nLANGDON Did they?     Look at the paper. \nVINCENZO I've seen it. \nLANGDON Look again. \nVincenzo looks at it. The word llluminati is written in ornate script.    Vincenzo looks back up --- so? \nLANGDON (cont'd) Turn it upside down. \nVincenzo does. Incredibly, the word reads exactly the same way upside down. \nLANGDON (cont'd) It's called an ambigram, the same backwards and forwards. That's common in a symbol, like a Jewish star, or yin-yang, or a swastika, but this is a word. People have searched for the llluminati ambigrammatic symbol for four centuries, modern symbologists even tried to create it, but nobody could pull it off, not even by computer. Most had concluded it was a myth. I wrote a book about it. (REALIZING) Which is why you're here, isn't it? \nVINCENZO \"The Art of the llluminati,\" by Robert Langdon. \nCUT TO: \nINT     LANGDON'S APARTMENT          DAY \nA hand skims along a bookcase and stops at that very title, a heavy academic tome.    Langdon pulls it out and drops it on the desk in his apartment with a THUD. \n(The apartment is cluttered with esoterica, the home of a man whose taste in furnishings was very fashionable about four hundred years ago.    A single man -- no kid stuff, no cats.) \nLangdon flips the book open to an illustrated section in the middle, filled with renderings of previous attempts to create the symbol he now holds in his hand. \nLANGDON Incredible.    Either someone just figured out how to make this, or they found it.    Recently.    Which would mean the llluminati have returned. (looks at Vincenzo) An ancient brotherhood, enemies of the church, surfacing just after the death of a Pope?    I'd pull you off vacation too. \nVINCENZO It's worse than just that.    Four cardinals were kidnapped from their quarters inside the Vatican some time between three and five a.m. this morning. Shortly afterward, the Office of the Swiss Guard received that document, along with the threat that the Cardinals will be publicly executed, one per hour, starting at seven p.m. tonight, in Rome. \nLANGDON (mind racing ahead) Conclave? \nVINCENZO Was to begin today.    We have postponed its start for a few hours, a story of illness, there are no suspicions. Yet. \nLANGDON What do you want from me? \nVINCENZO The perpetrators of this heinous act sent that -- ambigram, you say? -- as a provocation, a taunt.     But it may also be their undoing.     If you can help us learn their identity, perhaps we can stop them. \nLANGDON Why me? \nVINCENZO Your expertise.    Your erudition. And your involvement with recent Church -- shall we say \"mysteries?\" \nLANGDON I wasn't under the impression that episode had endeared me to the Vatican. \nVINCENZO Oh, it didn't.     But it made you -- what is the word? (Italian pronunciation) Formidable.     Formidable.    A plane is standing by twenty minutes from here. Will you come with me? \nLangdon doesn't move, just stares at the ambigram, still amazed. \nVINCENZO (cont'd) Professor Langdon, you have spent ten years of your academic life searching for the very symbol you now hold in your hand.     And the madman who created it, or who knows the secrets of its origin-- that person is in Rome. (checks his watch) How much longer must we pretend you have not already decided to come? \nCUT TO: \nEXT     AIRPORT       DAY \nA small private plane SCREAMS into the sky. \nEXT     ROME      DAY \nWe soar over Rome, the Eternal City. A helicopter WHOOSHES into frame below us. \nINT      HELICOPTER         DAY \nThe papal helicopter is plush inside, and nearly silent. A very pricey piece of equipment.    Vincenzo stares out the window. \nVINCENZO If the llluminati have returned and are in Rome, we will hunt them down and kill them. \nLangdon, seated across from him, stifles a laugh. \nLANGDON Spoken like a Roman Catholic. \nVincenzo looks at him sharply. \nLANGDON (cont'd) The llluminati didn't become violent anti-Papists until the 17th century. Initially, they were physicists, mathematicians, astronomers.      Their name means \"the Enlightened Ones.\" In the 1500s, they started meeting secretly to share their concerns about the church's inaccurate teachings. They were dedicated to the quest for scientific truth.     And for that, the church -- to use your words -- hunted them down and killed them.      Drove them underground. \nLangdon turns and looks out the front window of the helicopter as, up ahead, the marble facade of St. Peter's Basilica blazes like fire in the afternoon sun. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Into a secret society. \nEXT     ST.   PETER'S SQUARE         DAY \nPulling away from the helicopter, we see a coat of arms emblazoned on its side -- two skeleton keys crossing a shield and papal crown. The helicopter SWOOPS over St. Peter's Square, filled with more tourists than usual, due to the impending start of Conclave. \nWe drift toward a structure on the far side of the Square, closer to its huge, ornate windows.    As we approach, large swaths of black drop down, draping over the windows, closing off our view. \nINT      SISTINE CHAPEL        DAY \nInside, WORKERS continue to drape large bolts of black velvet over the windows, sealing this room off from outside.    Pulling back, we realize it's not just any room --- \n--- it's the Sistine Chapel.   As the last window is blackened, the room is bathed in a profound darkness lit only by candles. \nONE HUNDRED SIXTY-ONE MEN in red robes are gathered inside the Chapel, the College of Cardinals.    They talk in a polyglot of languages, milling about the place, conferring, catching up on old friendships. \nCardinal Mortati, the Dean of the College who led the Pope's elegy mass, is the type of man one crosses a room to see, not the other way around. \nHe chats in Italian with two other Cardinals, until a black- cassocked aide (FATHER SIMEON) outside the open doors of the Chapel catches his eye.    Mortati excuses himself, steps through the open doorway, and into --- \nINT      SALON      DAY \n-- the salon just outside the Chapel.    Father Simeon is an unctuous man in his fifties with eyes that are always looking for whoever's behind you.    (They speak in Italian, subtitled.) \nVITTORIA (CONTINUING) -- canister was stolen from our lab around midnight last night.     The intruder killed my research partner, Leonardo Bentivoglio, and mutilated him in order to bypass security. \nThey look at her, don't quite see the connection. \nVITTORIA (cont'd) We use retinal scanners. (they still don't get it) They cut out his eyes. \nThey cringe. \nVITTORIA (cont'd) That canister contains an extremely combustible substance called antimatter.    We need to locate it immediately or evacuate Vatican City. \nROCHER I'm quite familiar with incendiaries, Ms. Vetra.    I haven't heard of antimatter. \nVITTORIA It's new, energy research technology. It uses a reverse polarity vacuum to filter out anti-matter positrons generated in particle accelerations in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. \nThey look at her blankly.    She points at the screen, \nVITTORIA (cont'd) The anti-matter is suspended, there, in an airtight nanocomposite shell with electromagnets at each end. But if it were to fall out of suspension and come into contact with matter -- say, the bottom of the canister -- the two opposing forces will annihilate one another. Violently. \nROCHER And what might cause it to fall out of suspension? \nVITTORIA The battery going dead.     Which it will. (looks at the screen) In six hours and eleven minutes. \nSilence for a moment. \nVITTORIA (cont'd) Where is that camera?   Number eighty- six? \nOLIVETTI It's wireless.     It too was stolen. That could be anywhere inside the Vatican walls. \nVITTORIA You've got to find it. \nROCHER We're a bit preoccupied with four missing cardinals at the moment. \nVITTORIA You don't understand.    An annihilation is a cataclysmic event. It would be a blinding explosion, equivalent to about five megatons. The blast radius alone would be -- \nSoftly, Langdon speaks up from behind her. \nLANGDON \"Vatican City will be consumed by light.\" \nA few voices fall still.   They turn and look at him. \nROCHER Those are the exact words the kidnapper used. \nINT     ROCHER'S OFFICE       DAY \nA few moments later, they're crowded around the communications console at Rocher's desk, where a dimly-lit video recording is playing back on a computer screen.    (The office is behind a glass wall to one side of the headquarters.) \nThe images on the recording are of FOUR OLDER MEN, some in their sixties, the others in their seventies, filmed in dim light behind bars in a dank, dungeon-like space. \nA lightly accented VOICE speaks from behind the camera. \nVOICE (O.S.) We will destroy your four pillars... brand your preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science... and then bring your church down upon you. Vatican City will be consumed by light. \nLANGDON It's an ancient llluminati threat. (Rocher pauses the recording) The destruction of Vatican City through light.     The four pillars -- he probably means the kidnapped cardinals.     You didn't mention they were the preferiti. (to Vittoria) The favorites to be chosen as the new Pope.     Play it again. \nVOICE (O.S.) We will destroy your four pillars... brand your preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science... \nLANGDON Stop it there. \nRocher does \nLANGDON (cont'd) \"Brand\" them, another llluminati legend, this one says there are a set of five brands, each one an ambigram. (MORE) \nLANGDON (cont'd) The first four are the fundamental elements of science -- earth, air, fire, water.    The fifth -- is a mystery.    Maybe it's this. \nHe pulls the \"llluminati\" ambigram from his pocket. \nROCHER He said they'd be killed publicly. In churches. \nLANGDON (nods, not surprised) Revenge for La Purga. \nROCHER La Purga? \nLANGDON Don't you guys read your own history? 1668.     The church kidnapped four llluminati scientists and branded their chests with the symbol of the cross.     To \"purge their sins.\" Murdered them and left their bodies in the street as a warning to others to stop questioning church rulings on scientific matters.     It was after La Purga that a darker, more violent llluminati emerged.     This sounds like retribution. (to Rocher) Is there any more? \nRocher hits play again. \nVOICE (O.S.) .... and then bring your church down upon you.    Vatican City will be consumed by light... \nWhile listening this time, Langdon notices a darkened video monitor, inlaid at an angle on Rocher's desk.    It faces away from the outer office, and instead of an on/off switch, there is an oddly-shaped keyhole. \nVOICE (O.S.) (cont'd) A shining star at the end of the Path of Illumination. \nLangdon looks up sharply. \nLANGDON The Path of Illumination? \nRocher stops the video. \nLANGDON (cont'd) I need to get into the Vatican Archives. \nRocher shakes his head, looks at Olivetti harshly, is embarrassed. \nOLIVETTI Professor, this is not the appropriate moment to- \nROCHER Your petition has been denied seven times, Mr. Langdon. \nLANGDON This has nothing to do with that, (FAST) The Path of Illumination is an ancient trail through Rome that leads to the Church of the Illumination, a secret place where llluminati members could meet in safety.    If I can find the Segno, the sign that marks the start of the Path, I'm willing to bet the four churches along it are where he intends to murder your cardinals. If we can get to one of them before he does, we can stop it.    But to find the start of the path, I need to get into the Archives. \nROCHER Even if I wanted to help you, access is only by written decree of the curator and the Board of Vatican Librarians. \nLANGDON Or by papal mandate. \nROCHER Yes.    But as you've no doubt heard, the Holy Father is- \nHe stops.   They study the page, \nLANGDON (cont'd) Latin.    Can you --- ? \nVITTORIA A bit. \nShe reaches for the book, to pull it towards her, but Langdon SLAPS her hand.    He holds up his own, glove \nLANGDON Finger acids. \nShe rolls her eyes and leans in, studying the page.     There are sketches on the page as well. \nVITTORIA (READING) Movement of the planets... elliptical orbits... heliocentricity... \nLangdon's nervous. This doesn't sound right. Vittoria turns the page, turns it back. \nVITTORIA (cont'd) I'm sorry, I don't think there's anything that could be interpreted as a- \nLANGDON Do that again. \nShe turns the page, then turns it back.    Noticing something in the deep crevice of the margin as the page moves, Langdon grabs a magnifying glass on the end of a long pole and swings it over. \nThere, in the print gutter, what looked like a smudge is revealed under the magnifier to be -- \nLANGDON (cont'd) A line of text.    In English. \n(CONT'D) \nVITTORIA English?    Why English? \nLANGDON No one spoke it at the Vatican.    It was considered polluted.    Too free- thinking, the language of radicals like Shakespeare and Chaucer. \nHe rotates the book. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Another line. \nHe keeps rotating the book, finds two more tiny lines written at the very edges, barely visible to the naked eye. \nLANGDON (cont'd) \"The path of light is laid, the sacred test...\"    I need a pen, we have to transcribe this. \nVITTORIA Sorry, Professor.    No time. \nBefore Langdon can do anything to stop her, she RIPS the page from the text and shoves it in her pocket. \nLangdon's jaw drops.    He shoots a look over his shoulder at Lt. Chartrand, but the man's back is turned. \nLANGDON Ah, what the hell. \nHe SNAPS the magnifying glass off the end of its pole. \nCUT TO: \nEXT    VATICAN ARCHIVES DAY \nThe doors SLAM on a Vatican police car and the tires SQUEAL as Olivetti hits the gas. \nINT     CAR DAY \nOlivetti is behind the wheel, Vittoria's in front, Langdon leans in from the back seat. \nOLIVETTI Twenty minutes till eight, where are we headed? \nLANGDON I'll know in a minute, give me the paper. \nVittoria pulls the page from the Diagramma out of her pocket and hands it to Langdon.    He pulls the magnifier from his coat and studies the thin paper, turning it in his hands. \nLANGDON (cont'd) (READING) From Santi's earthly tomb with demon's hole... \nOLIVETTI Where did you get that paper?! \nLANGDON 'Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold. \nVITTORIA We borrowed it. \nLANGDON The path of light is laid, the sacred test... \nOLIVETTI Are you insane?! \nLANGDON Let angels guide you on your earthly quest. \nOLIVETTI You removed a document from the Vatican Archives?! \nLANGDON Huh?    Oh, um -- well, she moved so fast.\u00b7. \nVITTORIA The first marker sounds like it's at Santi's tomb. \nLANGDON (MUSING) Sounds like. \nVITTORIA But who is Santi? \nLANGDON Raphael. \nVITTORIA Raphael?     The sculptor? \nLANGDON Santi was his last name. \nVITTORIA So the path starts at Raphael's tomb! \nLANGDON (not entirely CONVINCED) Yeah. \nOLIVETTI Raphael is buried at the Pantheon. \nVITTORIA Is the Pantheon even a church? \nLANGDON Seven minutes to eight. \nVITTORIA (of the watch) Was that Mickey Mouse? \nLANGDON Long story. \nVITTORIA Make it short. \nLANGDON (THINKS) Can't be done. \nAnd with that they step through the entrance and into -- \nINT     PANTHEON       DAY \n-- the Pantheon, a massive, circular room with a 141-foot unsupported span even larger than the cupola of St. Peter's. There are a DOZEN TOURISTS scattered around, and a TOUR GROUP on one side hearing a lecture from a MUSEUM DOCENT. \nLangdon looks up at the hole in the ceiling through which a bright shaft of light is shining. \nLANGDON The oculus. That could be the \"demon's hole\" in the poem. \nLooking around, Vittoria sees several sarcophagi scattered around the room, all pointing obliquely in a certain direction. As they move stealthily through the crowd, they speak in low tones: \nVITTORIA Why are the tombs at an angle? \nLANGDON To face east.          Sun worship. \nVITTORIA But this is a Christian church. \nLANGDON (SHRUGS) New religions often adopt existing holidays to make conversion less shocking. December 25th was the pagan holiday of the Unconquered Sun. Made it a handy choice for Christ's birthday. \nVITTORIA You're saying Christianity is repackaged sun worship? \nLANGDON Where do you think halos came from? Not just sun worship though, the Catholics borrowed Communion from the Aztecs, canonization from Euphemerus, the cruciform from the Egyptians --- \nVITTORIA No wonder they don't like you around here. \nLANGDON Just trying to keep the conversation lively. (POINTS) Check the recesses.    I'll go left. See you in a hundred eighty degrees. \nHe starts to the left, she goes to the right, walking in the shadowy recesses behind the pillars at the edges of the room. \nLangdon walks slowly, checking out faces.       Tourists.   Couples. Teenagers.    More tourists. \nAround every column, there are shadows, and in those shadows -- \n--- nothing. \nHe looks at his watch.    Five minutes to eight.       And then -- \n--- a SHRIEK from the other side of the room.      He whirls, sees Vittoria backing away from something. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Vittoria! \nHe races across the room, reaches her at the far side. Her face is ashen.    She's pointing at something, aghast. \nVITTORIA Raphael's tomb!    But -- \nLangdon rushes forward to the crypt. There doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary, except --- \nVITTORIA (cont'd) --- it's the wrong one! \nLANGDON What are you talking about?! \nHe leans down, looks at the plaque on it. \nVITTORIA He was moved here, in 1759. A century after Diagramma was published! \nLANGDON That's not possible, the poem said- \nVITTORIA Where was he originally buried? \nLANGDON I don't know... Urbino, I think... (thinking like crazy) Santi's earthly tomb... what else could it possibly... Santi 's tomb... \nHis eyes flit around the room, from one ornate sarcophagus to another.    And then it hits him: \nLANGDON (cont'd) Damn it!    \"Santi's tomb\" must mean one of the chapels he built!    He's not buried in it, he designed it! Rich people commissioned burial chapels in churches all over Rome in his day! (looks up) And the \"demon's hole,\" it isn't the oculus, it's an undercroft, a crypt, common sixteenth century term! \nAt that very moment, the tour group is passing them, and the elderly Docent asks his group the perfunctory wrap-up: \nDOCENT Does anyone have any questions? \nLangdon busts in on the group. \nLANGDON Yes!    Did Raphael Santi ever design a chapel with an ossuary annex and angel figure commissioned by the Catholic Church?! \nThe Docent blinks.    Wasn't expecting quite so esoteric a question. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Well?! \nDOCENT I'm sorry, I... I can only think of one. \nLangdon suppresses the urge to grab him by the lapels and shake it out of him. \nLANGDON One'll do. \nCUT TO: \nEXT    PANTHEON DAY \nA clock in the square outside the Pantheon says 7:56.    Langdon and Vittoria face Rocher, Olivetti, and half a dozen Swiss Guard. \nROCHER Wrong?   What do you mean, wrong?! \nLANGDON (FAST) The first altar of science is the Chigi Chapel, in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, about a mile from here!     It used to be called Capella della Terra, Chapel of the Earth. Earth, the first element!     This is it, I'm certain. \nA compass.    He catches it, holds it steady, and walks toward the edge of the roof as the compass needle swivels and settles on SW. \nLangdon looks up, following the line of the needle, up over the rooftops of Rome, to a massive structure in the distance, exactly in line with the compass needle. \nA huge dome on the horizon blots out the setting sun. \nST.   PETER'S BASILICA. \nCUT TO: \nINT      CAR      NIGHT \nCLOSE ON a map of Rome, unfolded in the back seat of a racing car and spread out over Langdon and Vittoria's laps.    Langdon has a pen and is drawing a line on the map, through -- \nLANGDON The black rectangles with crosses are churches, and none of them intersect the line until it comes to an end, right in the middle of St. Peter's Square. \nNight has fallen, and the four Alfa Romeos are now speeding across Rome.    No sirens, but lots of speed.    Olivetti drives, Rocher is in the passenger seat. \nROCHER Your theory doesn't hold up, Professor.    Michelangelo designed St. Peter's, not Bernini. \nLANGDON The Basilica is Michelangelo, but the square is Bernini.    The second marker must be a statue in the square. \nVITTORIA It's ten minutes till nine!   Can we go any faster?! \nROCHER Not unless we want the full attention of the world press. \nShe looks down, to two television screens mounted into the backs of the front seats.    Both are tuned to coverage of the papal selection process, REPORTERS doing stand-ups from the middle of crowded St. Peter's Square. \nWe move in on one of the images, then into the image, coming out - \nCUT TO: \nEXT     ST.   PETER'S SQUARE     NIGHT \n--- on a television monitor in St. Peter's Square. The Reporter, a JAPANESE WOMAN, is giving a stand-up report on the progress so far, gesturing to the chimney over the Sistine Chapel. \nThe crowd has grown, now four thousand, maybe five. FLASHBULBS POP.    A few PROTESTERS CHANT. \nAlmost silently, behind them all, half a dozen black Alfa Romeos race in, too fast, and come to an abrupt halt. \nIN ROCHER'S CAR, \nthey all get out, trying to avoid causing a panic. \nLangdon walks into the square, eyes focused on an object in the middle. \nLANGDON Another obelisk.    We're close. \nHe looks up, at row after row of statues that ring the square from atop the oval colonnades. \nSHARPSHOOTERS scurry among the statuary, setting themselves up. \nIn the crowd, Rocher MUTTERS into his radio and to undercover SWISS GUARD scattered throughout.    The crowd is unaware of them. \nLangdon keeps walking, turning in circles, looking above him, to the tops of the colonnades that border the square. \nVITTORIA There must be a hundred statues up there, which one is it? \nLANGDON How in God's name would anyone make a sculpture about air? \nAnd indeed there are.    Langdon looks at his watch.      Two minutes to nine. \nAnd then he freezes.    Staring down, not up. \nHe takes a step back. There is a fresco carved into the square beneath his feet, or more accurately -- \nLANGDON (cont'd) Bas relief! \nHe takes a step back, to look at the carving, as does Vittoria. \nLANGDON (cont'd) The other half of sculpture is bas relief. (to Vittoria) Look for more!     Something having to do with air! \nThey move through the crowd, pushing people aside, causing a bit of a ruckus as they try to uncover the elaborate carvings in the stone of the square. \n(IF WE ARE EAGLE-EYED, at this point we will see TWO ROBED MEN, one helping the other, who carries a cross, as they pass through the crowd behind Langdon.) \nRemembering something, Langdon rushes forward, toward the center of the square, uncharacteristically brusque with the crowd, shoving his way through now. \nHe draws close to one carving in particular, slows to a stop, and stares down at it, eyes wide. \nIt's a carving of an angel's face, cheeks billowing outward as it blows a gust of wind, symbolized by five vertical streaks.    Its title is --- \nLANGDON (cont'd) \"West Ponente.\"    The West Wind.    An angel's face and five streaks.   Air! \nSo this is it, but now what?    They look around frantically, scanning the crowd.    So does Rocher, so does Olivetti.    The BELLS of St. Peter's start to TOLL the hour. \nNEARBY, \na LITTLE GIRL dances with a doll.      Happily unaware of what's going on. \nELSEWHERE, \nsome PROTESTERS tangle.      Some believe one thing, others don't. \nSwiss Guard and Vatican Police race in to break it up. But there's no bloodshed. \nCLOSE TO THAT, \na ROBED MAN carrying a small wooden cross falls to the ground. Somebody near him SCREAMS. \nNEARBY, \nthe Little Girl is jostled by a HOMELESS MAN, drops her doll. \nThe Camerlengo just stares at him, a power struggle. Which he is going to lose. \nCAMERLENGO As you say. (turns away) Commander Rocher, the search for the device? \nROCHER We've turned the power off and on to about twenty percent of Vatican City. Nothing on the video yet. \nCAMERLENGO Mr. Langdon, you've been right so far, if belatedly, about the Path. It's now nine fifteen, how quickly can you find the next church? \nLangdon refers to a map spread out on the desk. \nLANGDON The line of the breath in the carving points due east, directly away from Vatican City, but there are five lines, so there's room for error. \nWhile he talks, an AIDE in a business suit is ushered quietly in the door by a Swiss Guardsman.    He's carrying a satchel. Vittoria recognizes him, and he goes to her. \nLANGDON (cont'd) There are about twenty churches that intersect it.    None of their names invoke \"fire,\" but there must be a Bernini sculpture inside one of them that does.    I'm going to need to get back into the Archives to find it. \nCAMERLENGO (to Olivetti) Escort him. \nLangdon looks to Vittoria -- you coming? She looks up from a table, where she's opened the satchel brought in by the Aide. She holds two leather-bound books in her hand. \nVITTORIA The journals I asked for.    I'd like to stay here and study them.    If Leonardo told anyone else about our project, that could be the killer. \nCAMERLENGO Fine. \nThe group starts to break up, half of them headed for the doors. As Langdon rolls up the map on the desk, the Camerlengo notices his black clothes for the first time. \nCAMERLENGO (cont'd) Professor, would it surprise you to find those clothes suit you? \nLangdon manages a sliver of a smile, starting to like this guy. \nLANGDON It would surprise the hell out of me. \nCUT TO: \nEXT     ST.   PETER'S SQUARE     NIGHT \nSt. Peter's has been cleared out, the throng moved to barricades at its edges so that the crime scene can be properly investigated. Flashbulbs POP everywhere. \nThe row of TV REPORTERS is nearly shoulder to shoulder, and we move along them --- first up is an ITALIAN REPORTER: \nITALIAN REPORTER (SUBTITLED) -- a statement just released by the Vatican expressing sympathy for the family of the mugging victim, a tourist from Dusseldorf -- \nStill moving, we pass a CHINESE REPORTER. \nCHINESE REPORTER (SUBTITLED) --- who is now confirmed dead. Vatican Police have a suspect in custody, and after photographing the crime scene --- \nStill moving,   a FRENCH REPORTER. \nFRENCH REPORTER (SUBTITLED) --- will allow the crowds of faithful back into St. Peter's Square, where security will be doubled. \nStill moving, a BBC REPORTER,    in English. \nBBC REPORTER Sadly, the Vatican spokesman points out, where crowds go -- \nAnd finally, an AMERICAN. \nAMERICAN REPORTER --- so often follows crime. We're trying now to get the name of the tourist who was- wait a- \nThe American Reporter looks confused, somebody's talking to her in her earpiece. \nAMERICAN REPORTER (cont'd) We're getting word now of -- smoke, smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney, apparently there's been another vote I \nAnd almost as one, the row of TV cameras all swing away from the crime scene in the square and up, to the Sistine Chapel chimney, where there is indeed a thick cloud -- \n--- of black smoke.    Still no new pope, and the subject is effectively changed. \nCUT TO: \nINT     VATICAN ARCHIVES      NIGHT \nLangdon and Lt. Chartrand, the young Swiss Guardsman, walk quickly down the row of hermetically sealed vaults in the Vatican Archives. \nLangdon's leading, looking at the names on the outsides of each of the individual vaults. \nCHARTRAND What are you looking for this time? \nLANGDON Assets. \nCHARTRAND I beg your pardon? \nLANGDON Artwork is valuable, and corporations tend to keep track of their holdings. \nCHARTRAND The Catholic Church is not a corporation, Signore, it is a beacon, a source of inspiration for one billion lost and frightened souls. \nLANGDON Sure sure, I get that. \nHe stops, pointing up at a sign on the end of one of the vaults -- BANCO VATICANO. \nLANGDON (cont'd) But it's also a bank. \nHe takes one last breath of oxygen-rich air, pushes through the revolving door -- \nINT     VAULT     NIGHT \n--- and comes through the other side, eyes scanning the place.    A moment later, Chartrand follows him through the door.     Langdon looks at him --- you're coming in too? \nCHARTRAND Cfmmander Olivetti said I was not to leave your side this time. \nLANGDON (a mutter) Wasn't me, it was her, \nMOVING FAST ALONG THE LEATHER-BOUND VOLUMES, Langdon searches the place as fast as he can. \nBAM! \nMore words pop out at us -- \"His great golden spear... filled with fire...\" \nLANGDON (cont'd) Fire. \nStill more -- \"woman inflamed by passion's fire...\" \nAnd now a close-up of her enraptured face. \nLANGDON Fire. \nAnd now three things happen in quick succession: \n-- Langdon SLAMS the ledger shut, \n-- the ribbons on the air vent fall as the oxygen into the vault is cut off, and \n-- one by one, ALL THE LIGHTS IN THE ARCHIVES GO OUT. \nTotal silence for a moment. \nLangdon and Chartrand look at each other in the darkness. \nLANGDON (cont'd) The door -- ? \nCHARTRAND Electronic. \nLANGDON That's too bad. \nCUT TO: \nINT     ST.   PETER'S BASILICA          NIGHT \nThe Camerlengo, flanked by two Swiss Guardsmen, escorts Vittoria rapidly across the deserted floor of St. Peter's Basilica. \nVITTORIA Where are we going? \nCAMERLENGO To see my father. \nVITTORIA I don't understand. \nThey circle past a pillar and she sees an orange glow up ahead, seeming to emanate from beneath the floor in the center of the basilica. \nCAMERLENGO I was orphaned when I was nine years old.    A bombing in Madrid -- Basque separatists protesting the visit of a Catholic archbishop. \nAs they draw closer, she sees it's the entrance to a sumptuous underground chamber, surrounded by scores of glowing oil lamps. \nCAMERLENGO (cont'd) The archbishop felt responsible, and he adopted me the following day.    I was raised by him, and by the church. \nThe Camerlengo starts down a winding stairway, rimmed by the lamps, \nON THE STAIRCASE, \nthey descend, lit by the spectral glow of the oil lamps. \nCAMERLENGO (cont'd) He was the wisest man I ever met, even with my youthful foolishness. He always saw the middle way.    I wanted to be ordained, but I also refused to be excused from military service. So he suggested I fly rescue missions, helicopters bringing the wounded to hospital. \nHe stops at the bottom of the stairs and looks up at her. \nCAMERLENGO (cont'd) He was a great man. \nVITTORIA He died? \nCAMERLENGO (NODS) Fourteen days ago. \nVittoria, stunned, realizes who he's talking about. \nCUT TO: \nINT     VATICAN ARCHIVES       NIGHT \nKA-CHUNG! Emergency lights switch on in the Vatican Archives, casting a weird, reddish glow over everything. \nBut the ribbons at the oxygen panel remain limp. \nBelow, Langdon pushes, again and again, on the deadened exit button, trying to activate the doors.    Nothing doing. \nHe's weak, weaving, barely on his feet. \nChartrand's already slumped against a wall, his radio in hand, keying it over and over again, but getting only static. \nLANGDON Anything? \nChartrand gestures weakly around the room. \nCHARTRAND Walls... lead-lined... no signal. \nLangdon blinks, his vision becoming seriously impaired. He holds his eyes closed for a moment, opens them, it's not much better. \nLangdon looks at the glass wall on the far side of the vault. Then at the row of bookcases.    Gets an idea. \nHe goes to the last bookcase, which is about six feet from the glass wall. He hoists himself up on the shelf of the bookcase opposite it, wedges himself in. \nAnd pushes with one leg.      The giant bookcase teeters, but just barely. \nLangdon hoists himself further up, gets both legs up against the bookshelf. \nPushes again -- more movement this time. \nNow he puts everything he has into it, straining like hell.    The bookcase starts to tip, goes just past the point of no return, starts to fall, gloriously headed straight for the glass wall, which it SLAMS into with enormous power and -- \n--- stops. \nLeaning against the wall.     Forget cracks, there's not even a scratch. \nCUT TO: \nEXT     VATICAN ARCHIVES      NIGHT \nThe face of Langdon's Mickey Mouse watch is smeared with blood from a cut on his hand, but we can still read the time. \nIt's 9:41. \nLangdon and Chartrand stagger down the front steps of the Vatican Archives, where they're immediately met by three Vatican Police cars.    Olivetti leaps out of one and meets them at the base of the steps, holding his hands up in defense almost before Langdon can lay into him. \nLANGDON Are you out of your minds?! \nOLIVETTI Please.    In the car. \nLANGDON Someone tried to kill me. \nOLIVETTI Do you know where the next church is? \nLANGDON Yes. \nOLIVETTI Then get in the car! \nLangdon jumps in the back seat of the car with Olivetti, and they SQUEAL away from the Archives. \nIN THE CAR, \nthey continue as the DRIVER tears through the streets of Rome. \nOLIVETTI We had no idea that -- \nLANGDON You heard me ask permission!    You assigned me an escort!    Don't try to tell me you didn't know I was in there! \nOLIVETTI (let me finish) Of course I knew, but we had no idea that portions of our white zones are \nOLIVETTI (cont'd) cross-wired with that building. Commander Rocher was extending the search, if he'd known the Archives were on that grid, he never would have killed the power. \nLangdon looks at him evenly, sees in Olivetti's eyes that they may be thinking the same thing. \nLANGDON Or there is the other possibility. \nOlivetti doesn't answer.     But he's thinking about it. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Infiltration is the Illuminati specialty -- why not the head of the Swiss Guard? \nOLIVETTI (AGONIZED) Perhaps. \nLANGDON I want to speak to the Camerlengo. \nOLIVETTI Il Camerlengo is unavailable, \nLANGDON Unavailable?        Why? \nOLIVETTI He's found evidence that the Holy Father was indeed murdered.    He is seeking guidance. \nLANGDON From whom? \nOlivetti looks at him   -- what are you, an idiot? \nOLIVETTI From God. \nLANGDON Oh, right. \nOLIVETTI Please.      Make an effort. \nCUT TO: \nINT     PAPAL OFFICE      NIGHT \nVittoria, escorted by the two Swiss Guardsmen from the grottoes, returns to the papal office. \nShe goes to the desk where she was sitting earlier, to resume her examination of the journals. \nBut the desk is bare. \nVITTORIA The journals.        Where are they? \nThe Guardsmen look at her blankly. \nVITTORIA   (cont'd) Who took the journals from this desk?! \nINT      APOSTOLIC PALACE - GREAT STAIRCASE        NIGHT \nThe Camerlengo, in deep meditation, slowly descends the stairs that lead to the Sistine Chapel. \nAt the bottom, Four Swiss Guard (in traditional garb) guard the locked doors. \nThe Camerlengo reaches them.    Hesitates.      Looks heavenward for one last word of encouragement, and then -- \nCAMERLENGO Unseal the doors. \nINT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT \nThere is an audible GASP from the assembled cardinals as the heavy locks CLUNK open, the chains RATTLE away, and the main doors of the Sistine Chapel sweep open. \nThe Camerlengo walks in, a stark presence in his black cassock amid the sea of red robes. Cardinal Mortati steps from behind the altar to meet him. \nMORTATI Signore, do you realize that for the first time in Vatican history, a Camerlengo has just crossed the sacred threshold of conclave after sealing the doors? \nCUT TO: \nCAMERLENGO There has been a development. \nEXT      ROME - STREET      NIGHT \nThe Cardinal SCREAMS, and Langdon looks to the sides, following the cables that reach to the walls. \nOne of the Vatican Cops ducks \nINTO THE LEFT SIDE AISLE, \nwhich is lit only by the wild orange flames.    He creeps forward, gun in front of him, toward a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall. \nHe reaches for it -- \n-- but a HAND reaches for him from behind, he's pulled off his feet and -- \nIN THE MAIN AISLE, \nOlivetti and Vincenzo whirl as TWO GUNSHOTS come from the darkened side aisle.    They race toward it. \nAT THE BONFIRE, \nLangdon SHOUTS to two more Vatican Cops, pointing upward. \nLANGDON The cleat, on the wall!   Get something to stand on! \nHe's pointing at a cleat, maybe ten feet up on the wall, where the right guide wire is attached. \nVatican Cops 2 & 3 drag a half-burned pew out of the fire and pull it underneath, leaning it against the wall for greater height, \nLangdon starts to climb it, to uncleat the wire. \nIN THE DARKENED LEFT AISLE \nOlivetti creeps forward, gun at the ready, Vincenzo close behind him. \nThey see a form on the floor in front of them and Olivetti bends down -- it's the first Vatican Policeman. \nDead in a pool of his own blood. \nVincenzo, standing behind Olivetti, looks down, horrified, and in that moment of distraction, a figure creeps up behind him -- \n-- and twists his head 180 degrees with one smooth motion. \nOlivetti whirls, but his gun comes around a split-second slower than he does and in that split-second a shadow falls over him, something SLASHES through the air and -- \nIN THE MAIN AISLE, \nLangdon struggles to climb the pew that's leaned against the wall as Vatican Cop 4 finds a long-handled candle snuffer and races toward the edge of the fire with it. \nBlinking back the intense heat, he manages to hook the Cardinals manacled foot with it, he turns to Langdon-- \n-- who, stretched as far as he possibly can, just manages to loose the wire from its cleat, holding tightly to it so as not to let the Cardinal go into free-fall. \nBut the pew on which he's balanced starts to wobble, then- -- \n-- BLAM!    BLAM! \nTwo gunshots THUD into the chests of Vatican Cops 2 & 3, who were supporting the pew.    They fall, the pew tips -- \n-- and Langdon,   falling   -- \n-- loses his grip on the chain. \nThe Cardinal falls toward the flames. Vatican Cop 4 tries to pull him to safety, but doesn't have enough of WHIRRS through the pulley until it reaches its the Cardinal to an abrupt stop, six feet lower \n-- and directly in the middle of the bonfire. \nHis SHRIEK of agony echoes through the burning church. \nLangdon SLAMS to the floor just at the edge of the burning church pews, maybe CRACKING a rib on the hard floor of the church. \nA FIGURE steps out of the shadows, looming over him, Langdon looks up, expecting a gunshot, but instead -- \n-- sees the bleeding figure of Olivetti, staggering toward him, clutching his slit throat in his last moments of life. \nNEARBY, \nVatican Cop 4 is desperately trying to pull the Cardinal from the flames, the end of the candle-snuffer is now hooked around the Cardinal's foot, he pulls him closer, reaches out, can almost grab his ankle -- \n-- until he is SHOT in the back.    He falls to the floor, drawing and dropping his gun in the process, losing his grip on the long-handled pole as well. \nOn the ground, bleeding, he sees his gun, just a foot away from his hand. \nHe reaches for it. \nAnd a foot steps on his wrist, BREAKING it. \nMr. Gray stands over him,     implacable. \nFROM A DISTANCE, \nwe see Mr. Gray fire two shots into the ground where Cop 4 is lying. \nThen he turns toward us. \nNEARBY, \nLangdon, still on the ground, looks up at the sound of the shots. Through the burning church pews he can see Mr. Gray, starting toward him. \nLangdon crawls, on all fours, through the outskirts of the bonfire, toward a recessed part of the wall ten or fifteen feet away. \nMr. Gray steps up behind him, raises his gun           -- \nVOICE   (O.S.) Polizia! \n-- and turns.    TWO MORE COPS, Roman Carbinieri, have run into the burning church and are making their way down the center aisle, straight toward him. \nFR. SIMEON It is the recommendation of many that you ask to be removed from your post as Great Elector -- \nMortati raises an eyebrow, seeing where this is going. \nFR. SIMEON (cont'd) -- thereby making yourself eligible to wear the Ring of the Fisherman. \nMortati looks at him for a moment, then looks back, over his shoulder, where a small knot of Cardinals, who have clearly discussed this, are looking at him in confirmation. \nMORTATI If it is God's will, may His will be DONE \nCUT TO: \nINT     OFFICE OF THE SWISS GUARD       NIGHT \nCLOSE ON a handwritten page, half-filled with mathematical computations; the other half with a scratchy handwritten prose. \n(IF WE'RE EAGLE-EYED, we'll notice the phrase we move past just as we cut into the scene is \"may His will be done,\" the same phrase we just heard Mortati utter.) \nCommandante Rocher is at his desk, Vittoria's leather-bound journals on the desk in front of him.    He's studying them carefully, and seems troubled by what he reads. \nThrough the glass walls of his office, we can see a commotion in the still-chaotic Swiss Guard headquarters.    Someone is walking toward us, briskly, a WOMAN'S VOICE complaining loudly in Italian. \nRocher calmly places the journals on top of the screen of the video monitor inlaid in his desk, the one we saw earlier, with a keyhole where a power switch should be. \nHe pushes a button and the monitor rotates shut, into an inlaid panel in the desk's surface.    It closes just after -- \nVITTORIA (O.S.) Those journals are private property. \n-- Vittoria arrives in the doorway, livid. \nVITTORIA (cont'd) I demand that you return them to me. \nROCHER (no attempt at a DENIAL) They are material evidence in a Vatican investigation. \nVITTORIA I am an Italian citizen and I have a right to- \nROCHER This isn't Italy.     It isn't even Rome.    The Vatican is its own country, with its own laws, and when those journals crossed our border they became our property.     You will get them back when I have decided they contain nothing of value to this investigation. \nShe looks at him, then down at the desk, where the outline of the hidden panel is visible in the veneer of the wood. \nVITTORIA Do you have something to hide, Commandante Rocher? \nROCHER Do you, Doctor Vetra? \nHe stresses her title, as if it offends \nCUT TO: \nEXT     SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA        NIGHT \nThe burning church, now mostly extinguished.    But a LARGE CROWD has gathered, along with a dozen police and fire vehicles. \nINT     SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA        NIGHT \nAs FIREMEN put out the last of the flames (not using water, but Halon gas, which creates no steam), a metallic TAPPING sound comes from somewhere. \nOne of the Firemen approaches another, gets his attention   -- stop what you're doing and listen. \nThey shut down a hose and stop, listening. \nThere it is again.    They SHOUT in Italian to the others, now everybody shuts down their hoses and listens. \nThe metallic TAPPING echoes in the smoldering church. \nThey walk toward it -- it's coming from an oval plate in the floor, like a manhole cover, heavy and carved.   We've seen one of these before, it leads to a Demon's Hole. \nThe TAPPING is louder now, rhythmic.    Somebody's down there. Crowbars are produced, the cover of the Demon's Hole is pried off and shoved aside, revealing -- \n-- Robert Langdon, wedged into the top of the opening, holding a rock in one hand as he clings precariously to the walls he has climbed. \nStrong hands reach down, haul him to his feet      -- \nAT THE FRONT OF THE CHURCH, \n-- and those same feet hurry to the front of the smoldering church, coming to a stop in front of -- \n-- Bernini's Ecstasy of St. Teresa. \nThe statue he came here to find.    Now, as the Italian-speaking police and firemen work around him, Langdon moves, as if in his own world.    He looks to the statue, repeating fragments of the poem he has by now memorized: \nLANGDON Let angels guide you on your lofty quest... \nDirectly over the recumbent saint, against a backdrop of gilded flame, hovers Bernini's angel.    The angel's hand clutches a pointed spear of fire. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold... \nLangdon's eyes follow the direction of the shaft, arcing toward the right side of the church. \nVOICE (O.S.) Professor? \nA ROMAN POLICEMAN, a member of the Carbinieri, comes up to Langdon, discussing him in Italian with TWO OTHER COPS as he approaches. \nROMAN COP Langdon, is it? \nLangdon ignores him, pointing at the wall instead. \nLANGDON What direction is that? \nROMAN COP Direction?   West, I think.    Mr. Langdon, we've confirmed with the Vatican that they invited you into this investigation, but what I- \nLANGDON Map. \nA MOMENT LATER, \nEXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE         NIGHT \nSt. Peter's Square is even more crowded than before.    Another move down the row of international television reporters, but this one's about twice as fast as the last one.    (Anybody not speaking English is subtitled.) \nSOUTH AFRICAN REPORTER -- possibility of terrorism, as the church has now confirmed arson at one of its oldest and holiest churches \nMoving on, to an Asian Reporter: \nASIAN REPORTER -- resulting in at least six confirmed deaths -- \nTo a Brazilian: \nBRAZILIAN REPORTER -- initial rumors that one of the dead was Cardinal Ebner of Frankfurt -- \nTo an American: \nAMERICAN REPORTER -- been refuted by the Vatican, which has asked international media not to engage in, quote, \"wild speculation\"-- \nAnd to a French Woman: \nFRENCH REPORTER -- as conclave goes on, with no sign of agreement on a new pope yet. \nCUT TO: \nINT     OFFICE OF THE POPE         NIGHT \nIn the papal office, the Camerlengo sits, alone, in front of the fireplace, staring into the flames, thinking. \nBehind him, a small knot of Swiss Guard debate their next move in Italian.    He speaks softly to them, in Italian, subtitled. \nCAMERLENGO At 11:15, if the church is still in peril, give the order to evacuate the cardinals.    But with dignity, let them exit into St. Peter's Square, with their heads held high.    I don't want the last image of this church to be frightened old men sneaking out a back door.    If Cardinal Mortati protests, escort him bodily.    Do you understand? \nThe Guardsmen are uncomfortable with that idea. \nSWISS GUARDSMAN If you think it is the right thing, Signore. \nCAMERLENGO I'm certain it's the wrong thing, and I will be removed from my post for it.    But I also know we have no choice. \nThey just look at him.   You're the boss. \nCAMERLENGO   (cont'd) Please clear the room so that I may pray on the matter. \nThey get out.    He stares into the flames. \nCUT TO: \nEXT      PIAZZA NAVONA      NIGHT \nPiazza Navona is lightly peopled on this soft summer night with so much attention directed toward the Vatican. \nThe hood of a car glides into view, nearly silent, on the far side of the fountain.    Langdon and the two Roman Cops step out and survey the area. \nLangdon looks to the fountain.    Its central core is twenty feet tall, a rugged mountain of marble with caves and grottoes through which water churns.    Atop it stands an obelisk that climbs another forty feet. \nLANGDON (eyes searching) Let angels guide you... \nBut there's no angel anywhere.      He turns to the first Roman Cop. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Isn't there an angel on this fountain? \nROMAN COP Not anymore. \nLANGDON The marker's no good without an angel, pointing to the final- \nROMAN COP Blame Mussolini.    He wanted it for his summer- \nBut the Cop stops mid-sentence as he notices the black van parked on the far side of the fountain. \nSilently, the Cops gesture to each other to go opposite ways around the fountain, and to Langdon to stay where he is. \nLangdon, frustrated but no action hero, watches them as they slowly encircle the van. \nAT THE DRIVER'S SIDE, \nthe First Cop approaches the Driver's Window, sees Mr. Gray sitting implacably behind the wheel.    He taps lightly with a knuckle, his drawn gun at his side, just out of view. \nMr. Gray opens the window. \nMR. GRAY Si? \nThe Roman Cop looks down, ever so briefly, at a small spreading bloodstain on Mr. Gray's shirt.    When he looks back up -- \n-- there is a silenced pistol pointing directly at him. \nPHOOM. \nHe takes a bullet in the forehead, slumps forward against the window, and -- \nFROM A DISTANCE, \nwe see his body pulled rapidly into the van through the driver's window.    Whole thing took about three seconds.    DINERS at an outdoor cafe don't even notice. \nFROM LANGDON'S POINT OF VIEW, \non the other side of the fountain, the van rocks slightly, but he can't see anything out of the ordinary. \nHe turns, looks to the Second Cop, who is just now approaching from the rear of the van. \nWITH THE SECOND COP, \nthis one's got his gun in front of him, he's ready for anything. We creep around the back of the van with him, and just as he comes around to where he can see the driver's side -- \n-- the barrel of the silencer presses into his forehead.   A quick exchange in Italian: \nGuidera nods weakly as, around them, it seems like everybody arrives at the fountain -- Carbinieri, Swiss Guard, Vatican Police, paramedics -- car after car after car. \nLANGDON (cont'd) (still to Guidera) Where is it?! \nCARDINAL GUIDERA Castel... Sant'Angelo... \nCUT TO: \nINT   OFFICE OF THE SWISS GUARD           NIGHT \nCLOSE ON a row of weapons in a cabinet in the Office of the Swiss Commander Rocher selects a pistol and slips it into a harness. \nWhile his back is turned to the room, Lt. Chartrand, the young Swiss Guardsman who escorted Langdon to the Archives, hurries up behind him. \nCHARTRAND Langdon says Cardinal Guidera will be killed in Piazza Navona.    He's on his way there with two Carbinieri. \nROCHER Send everyone we can spare. \nHe closes and locks the cabinet, heads for the door.     Alone. \nCHARTRAND You? \nROCHER Staying here to continue the search for the explosive. \nHe leaves.    Chartrand looks back at the weapons cabinet.     Sees the space from which the pistol was taken. \nCUT TO: \nEXT     CASTEL SANT'ANGELO         NIGHT \nWe fly over a bridge, flanked by a dozen angel statues standing sentinel on either side, leading directly toward-- \n-- the Castel Sant'Angelo, Castle of the Angels, its ancient stone ramparts lit by floodlights.    Soaring swiftly up its facade, we close in on a mammoth bronze angel standing atop the citadel. \nIt points the way, all right, its sword aimed directly downward, at the castle itself, as if to say you've found it. \nDOWN ON THE GROUND, \nseveral Police Cars come to a stop in front of the castle at the same time. \nLangdon climbs out the back of one just as Vittoria gets out of a car driven by a SWISS GUARDSMAN. \nLangdon grabs her, thrilled to see her. \nLANGDON You're all right? \nVITTORIA I'm all right, what about you?! \nLANGDON Cold and wet but alive.       Where's Rocher? \nVITTORIA I don't know. He took the journals, he's hiding something. \nMore Cops arrive, and a SECURITY GUARD is pressed into service behind them, opening the massive front doors to the Castle, \nLANGDON This is it.    The Church of Illumination is somewhere in the castle. \nCops pour into the courtyard of the castle.       Langdon and Vittoria follow. \nEXT     CASTEL SANT'ANGELO - COURTYARD          NIGHT \nThey dash around the outer bulwark of the Castle.       The courtyard beneath them looks like a museum of ancient warfare     -- catapults, stacks of marble cannonballs, fearful contraptions. \nAs the Cops quickly and silently search every nook, Langdon and Vittoria follow closely. \nLANGDON The Vatican used this place for centuries as a hideout, a prison for enemies of the church -- there are passages and catacombs everywhere. It makes sense, the Illuminati infiltrated the Church's own stronghold.    Bernini was chief architect here, he left clues everywhere, it's even surrounded by a pentagonal park! \nThey reach the central core of the castle. \nAnother angel statue, similar to the one atop the citadel, stands in front of them, its sword held in the same position, pointing downward at an angle. \nLangdon studies it, follows the line of the angel's sword       -- and sees a gated drive that cuts across the courtyard itself. \nLANGDON   (cont'd) There. \nA MOMENT LATER, \nhe and Vittoria are down in the courtyard, at the mouth of the gated drive. The gate is open and leads to a tunnel, a gaping entry in the central core. \nLANGDON A traforo.    Commanders on horseback used them to ride directly into a castle from the outside. \nHe gestures to the nearby Cops, who are already on it, and they all head into the darkened tunnel. \nINT   TUNNEL       NIGHT \nPolice flashlights switch on and their beams bounce crazily off the walls of the tunnel. \nFootsteps CRUNCH as they all press in, Langdon and Vittoria content to let men with guns lead the way. \nIt gets darker as they descend, and then, by the echo of their footfalls, they can tell they've entered -- \nA LARGE CHAMBER. \nMore lights are switched on, illuminating the space, which terminates in three stone walls. \nLANGDON It's a dead end. \nBut the Police attention is focused on the black van parked in the center of the room. \nRoman Police snap into action, flashlight beams bounce everywhere, guns point in every possible window of the van, SHOUTS for whoever's inside to get the hell out now, now, now. \nThe doors are flung open. \nThe van is empty. \nINT      APOSTOLIC PALACE - HALLWAY            NIGHT \nCommander Rocher, eyes dead-set, walks down a hallway in the Apostolic Palace.    He passes two Swiss Guardsmen with radios. \nROCHER Get on the radio and put the word out. Conclave is to remain sealed. \nSWISS GUARDSMAN But the Camerlengo gave the order for evacuation at eleven fif- \nROCHER I'm countermanding it. \nSWISS GUARDSMAN BUT- \nROCHER That door stays SHUT! Do you understand? \nSWISS GUARDSMAN Yes sir. \nRocher keeps walking. \nCUT TO: \nINT   CHURCH OF ILLUMINATION    NIGHT \nLangdon and Vittoria creep into the Church of Illumination, and we get our first good look at it. \nThe embellishments, though faded, are replete with familiar symbology.    Pentagram tiles.    Planet frescoes.    Pyramids. \nVITTORIA We have thirty minutes left, I can still change the battery if we can find the cannister. \nLangdon nods, but he's fascinated by the place. \nIn the center of the room, there is an open fireplace, its embers still smoking.    The four Illuminati brands, their faces wiped clean, have been placed back in a molded velvet case. \nLangdon, fascinated, spots an empty slot in the very center of the case, surrounded by the four used brands. \nBut this one's missing. \nVittoria arrives over his shoulder, having completed a quick search of the place. \nVITTORIA   (cont'd) It isn't here. \nLANGDON There's a fifth brand. \nVITTORIA What? \nHe touches the indentation in the velvet, puzzling it out. \nLANGDON Two crossed keys. \nVITTORIA The symbol for the Vatican? \nLANGDON The papacy. (THINKING) They're going to kill him.    Before they blow up the Vatican they're going to kill and brand the pope himself. \nVITTORIA But there is no pope. \nLANGDON Technically, there is. \nVITTORIA The Camerlengo?!    We have to- \nMR. GRAY (O.S.) Please place your gun on the floor. \nThey freeze. Vittoria looks at Langdon, who nods     -- you'd better do it.    She does. \nMR. GRAY       (cont'd) Now turn around. \nThey turn and face Mr. Gray.    He looks quite dapper, and not too much the worse for wear.    There is a briefcase on the ground beside him, and he's changed into a fresh shirt. \nMR. GRAY   (cont'd) Kick it to me. \nShe does.    He picks it up, ejects the clip and the round in the chamber, pockets them, and tosses the gun into the smoldering fire. \nLANGDON You could have been long gone by now. \nMR. GRAY Some do God's work for love, others for money.    Which do you take me for? \nAs if to answer his own question, he picks up the briefcase from the floor beside him.    Then studies Langdon for a moment. \nMR. GRAY You're not one of them. \nLANGDON Neither are you. I was expecting a fanatic. \nMR. GRAY When they call me -- and they all call me -- it is so important to them that I know what they ask is the Lord's will.    Or Allah's, or Yahweh's.    And I suppose they're right.

He looks down, sees three keyholes in the door, and an ancient key in each of them. \nChartrand puts his ear to the door, hears VOICES    -- \nINT     IL PASSETTO      NIGHT \n-- and, on the other side, Langdon and Vittoria squint at the light as the heavy door is hauled open before them. \nChartrand looks at them in amazement    -- how'd you get here? \nLANGDON The Camerlengo is in danger! \nINT     PAPAL OFFICES - HALLWAY         NIGHT \nChartrand, Langdon, and Vittoria round the corner and race down the hallway toward the Pope's office, just as -- \n-- a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM comes from behind the closed doors. The Swiss Guard move fast, throwing open the door. \nINT      POPE'S OFFICE      NIGHT \nLangdon and the others race into the pope's office and find a truly bizarre scene. \nRocher is near the fireplace, brandishing his sidearm, aimed at the Camerlengo, who lays on the floor, writhing in agony. \nHis cassock is torn open, and his bare chest is seared black.     A large, square brand is on the floor at Rocher's feet. \nTwo of the Swiss Guard act without hesitation    -- they open fire. \nTwo bullets SLAM into Rocher's chest and he crumples. \nFather Simeon bursts into the room, and as he does the Camerlengo rolls over onto one side, points his index finger at Simeon, and cries out a single word: \nCAMERLENGO ILLUMINATUS! \nFR. SIMEON You bastard!        You sanctimonious- \nHe rushes at the Camerlengo and Chartrand reacts on instinct, putting three bullets in Father Simeon's back. \nHe falls to the floor, dead. \nChartrand and the Guards dash to the Camerlengo, who clutches his chest, convulsing in pain. \nLangdon walks toward him, stunned, as the Guards pull the Camerlengo's hands away from his wound, revealing the fifth brand. \nThe crossed keys, seared into the flesh of his chest. \nLangdon looks at Rocher in utter disbelief. Rocher's still alive, trying to say something, holding out a hand. \nEveryone else in the room is focused on the Camerlengo, so Langdon bends down, takes the dying man's hand. \nRocher looks up at him, desperation in his eyes, trying to communicate something but too weak to say more than: \nROCHER For safety. \nAnd his eyes close. \nLangdon withdraws his hand from Rocher's, and finds the dying man has pressed something into his palm. \nA key. \nLangdon looks at it, and it gives him a thought. He turns, looks at the Camerlengo, whose chest is exposed. \nThe crossed keys are indeed branded there      -- but they're upside down. \nLangdon slips the key in his pocket and approaches the Camerlengo as Chartrand gets to his feet, on his radio. \nCHARTRAND I need a Medevac to St. Peter's Square, right now! \nThe Camerlengo struggles to a sitting position. \nCAMERLENGO Order the evacuation.    We only have nineteen minutes. \nLANGDON (POINTING) The keys.    They're upside down. \nVITTORIA You think it's a sign? \nLANGDON Everything has been a sign, why should this be any different? \nHe looks at Rocher, dead on the floor.        Back at the branded keys. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Crossed keys -- the symbol for the papacy, upside-down. \nCAMERLENGO St. Peter. \nVITTORIA Heat decreases battery life.      We may have less than five minutes. \nCAMERLENGO So? \nVITTORIA If I pull the power with less than five minutes, the residual charge won't hold suspension. We should leave it and get clear if we can. At least if it goes off down here the damage will be- \nCAMERLENGO NO. \nAnd with that, he snatches up the canister and takes off running, back the way they came. \nVITTORIA Wait! \nLANGDON Father, please! \nBut he's already gone, around a darkened corner. \nEXT      ST.

A ROAR comes from outside and we see -- \nEXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE           NIGHT \n-- the crowd in St. Peter's Square, in rapture. There is SINGING, there's CHANTING of the Camerlengo's name.    It's exactly midnight. \nINT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT \nIn the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Mortati is in hushed, urgent conversation with a group of seven or eight Cardinals. \nMORTATI Signores... you are no doubt aware that by Holy Law the man is ineligible for election to the papacy.    He is not a cardinal, he is a priest, a chamberlain.    And there is the matter of his inadequate age.    I'm sorry, the protocols of conclave are not subject to modification.    I will not call a ballot on this matter. \nThe African Cardinal who cast his vote earlier speaks up. \nAFRICAN CARDINAL But Signore, you would not call the ballot.    Surely you remember -- you gave up your post as Great Elector. \nMortati looks at him.    Boxed into a corner. \nOutside, the crowd in St. Peter's can be heard, singing joyously. \nA SECOND CARDINAL steps forward. \nSECOND CARDINAL They are singing in St. Peter's Square!   What happened here tonight transcends our laws! \nMORTATI Does it?    Is it God's will that we abandon reason and give ourselves over to frenzy?   Discard the rules of the church? \nA THIRD CARDINAL now, a peacemaker: \nTHIRD CARDINAL Perhaps they need not be discarded. \nThey all look at him. \nTHIRD CARDINAL   (cont'd) I am thinking now of Romano Pontifici Eligendo, Numero 63. \nMost of the Cardinals look puzzled -- but Mortati's face darkens. \nTHIRD CARDINAL (cont'd) Balloting is not the only method by which a Pope can be elected.    There is another, more divine method. \nMORTATI \"Acclimation by Adoration.\" \nTHIRD CARDINAL Si, signore! \nThe Second Cardinal sparks to this idea. \nSECOND CARDINAL Of course! (answering those around him who look confused) Election by Adoration occurs when all the cardinals, as if by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, freely and spontaneously, unanimously and aloud, proclaim one individual's name. \nTHIRD CARDINAL And the law states that Adoration supersedes all other eligibility requirements.    The candidate need only be an ordained member of the clergy. (DRAMATICALLY) BUT! (they listen) He must be present in the Sistine Chapel at the moment of election. \nMany cries now of \"Bring the Camerlengo to us!\" \nMortati looks deeply troubled. \nCUT TO: \nINT     ROCHER'S OFFICE      NIGHT \nBandaged now, Langdon and Vittoria are ushered into Rocher's office by a Swiss Guardsman. \nSWISS GUARDSMAN Please wait here while we arrange your transportation.    May I get you anything? \nThey shake their heads, no thanks.        Settle into chairs to the side of Rocher's desk. \nThey look uncomfortable   -- it's weird to be in a dead man's office. \nVittoria looks at his desk.     Thinks of something. \nShe gets up and goes to it, running her hand lightly over it. \nLANGDON What are you doing? \nVITTORIA Leonardo's journals.          I want them back. \nShe feels in the surface of the desk and finds the square outline of the inlaid panel where Rocher hid the journals.    She tries prying it open, but that doesn't work, she tries pushing down on the front of it -- \n-- and the panel slowly rotates open.    The journals, which were laid on top of the television monitor, slide out and onto the desk. \nVittoria scoops them up and is about to close the panel again when -- \nLANGDON Wait a minute. \nHe looks down at the monitor.        Thinking. \nAt its odd, key-shaped on/off switch. \nHe pulls something from his pocket      -- the key Rocher gave him, just as he died. \nIN LANGDON'S MIND, \nhe sees Rocher's face, looking up at him, dying: \nROCHER For safety. \nBACK IN THE OFFICE, \nLangdon looks at the key, and its odd shape.    Looks down at the monitor, the same odd shape where its switch should be. \nIN LANGDON'S MIND, \nthey're back in the Pope's office, but Rocher is alive, and saying words he said earlier: \nROCHER The Holy Father was subject to seizures... but he took steps. \nROCHER (raising the gun) Put it down! \nBut the Camerlengo RAMS the red-hot brand into the exposed flesh of his bare chest.    His skin SIZZLES and smokes, Rocher SHOUTS, the Camerlengo SCREAMS in agony, and we know the rest -- \n-- the door bursts open, Swiss Guard pour in, Rocher is shot, Father Simeon races toward the Camerlengo -- \nFR. SIMEON You bastard!       You sanctimonious- \n-- and the Camerlengo rolls over, pointing one long finger at Father Simeon and CRYING OUT: \nCAMERLENGO ILLUMINATUS! \nAs we saw before, Lt. Chartrand FIRES THREE TIMES, killing Father Simeon in his tracks, we pull back, the image turns to -- \nINT      ROCHER'S OFFICE      NIGHT \n-- video again, and as we complete the move out from the monitor, we see it isn't Langdon and Vittoria watching the image this time -- \n--- but Cardinal Mortati, flanked by two other red-robed Cardinals and a half-dozen Swiss Guardsman. \nLangdon and Vittoria stand to one side as Mortati turns and looks at them.    Suddenly, he seems very, very old. \nCUT TO: \nINT     GRAND STAIRCASE       NIGHT \nThe Camerlengo, escorted by two Swiss Guardsman, descends the Royal Staircase that leads to the Sistine Chapel. \nThough he is injured and limping, he radiates confidence, even benevolence, a man certain this is the greatest day of his life. \nHe approaches the chapel doors, speaks to the Swiss Guard posted there as he approaches. \nCAMERLENGO I have been summoned by the College of Cardinals. \nOh, they know all about it.    They lift their swords, the doors sweep open, the Camerlengo strides boldly across the threshold -- \nINT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT \n-- and stops, right there, the look of imminent ascendancy frozen on his face. \nThe Cardinals are looking at him, all right, but not in joy, not in wonder, not for leadership.    One hundred sixty-one faces are turned toward his, with an expression of --- \n-- utter condemnation. \nHe stands there for a moment, searching their faces, trying to figure out what could possibly have happened. \nBut it doesn't matter. \nThey know.   And he knows they know. \nHe takes two steps backwards, almost involuntarily. \nStarts to teeter, balances himself in the doorway. \nThen straightens himself, smoothes his cassock. \nAnd turns and walks away, back up the staircase. \nTwo Swiss Guard move to go after him, quickly, but Cardinal Mortati gestures to them. \nMORTATI Gently.    But within our walls. \nThe Swiss Guard follow the Camerlengo up the staircase. \nCUT TO: \nINT      ST.

He heads for the main doors -- \n-- just as HALF A DOZEN SWISS GUARD step in from outside, blocking his way.    Some MURMUR softly into their radios. \nHe stops, turns around to come back the way he came --- \n-- but TWO SWISS GUARD appear in that doorway, also with radios. \nHe turns again, no way to go but toward the front of the Basilica. \nHe sees the candlelit balustrade near the front, the one that leads to the grottoes and the Necropolis.    He picks up his pace. \nThe Swiss Guard follow, at a slight distance. \nThe Camerlengo reaches the spiral staircase and stops, looking down, seeing the oil lamp he kicked over earlier. \nHe thinks.     He picks up a fresh lamp, holds it to his face    -- \n-- and blows out its flame with a soft PUFF. \nACROSS THE BASILICA, \nwe're with the Swiss Guard as they walk slowly toward him. \nBut they hear a CRY from ahead, he's gone down the stairs a short distance, and they can hear the sound of liquid SLOSHING. \nThey break into a run as they realize what he's about to do, they're twenty feet away, then ten, then just close enough to see the Camerlengo as he -- \n-- SMASHES a burning oil lamp at his feet.

They follow, quickly. \nOLIVETTI What makes you think he's going to murder the cardinals in the churches? \nLANGDON The llluminati called those four churches by a special name -- L'Altare di scienza.    The altars of science. \nVITTORIA (making the CONNECTION) \"Sacrifice them on the altars of science,\" he said. \nLangdon stops in his tracks. \nLANGDON Oh.   Oh, wow. \nHe's staring up at the impressive facade of the Vatican Archives. He takes a deep breath, then steps forward to enter.    But Vincenzo doesn't follow.    Langdon looks at him. \nLANGDON (cont'd) We go in alone? \nOLIVETTI Vatican Police aren't allowed access to the archives, only Swiss Guard. Lt. Chartrand will meet you inside. I'll be here when you're done. \nLangdon turns back to the Archives with a look of deep contentment -- he's wanted in here for a long, long time. \nAnd steps through the double doors. \nCUT TO: \nINT     APOSTOLIC PALACE        DAY \nThe Camerlengo walks briskly through the hallways of the Apostolic Palace, deep in thought.    He reaches the top of the Royal Staircase, and can hear the RUMBLING of activity in the Sistine Chapel below. \nLooking down the stairs, he sees the doorway open, and the gathering of cardinals inside.    As he reaches the base of the stairs, Cardinal Mortati, who has been summoned, steps outside to meet him, flanked by his aide, Father Simeon. \nVincenzo, leading them, turns up Via Sentinel and starts up the hill toward the Archives.    They follow, quickly. \nThey speak in English, their common language. \nCAMERLENGO You've been informed of the new situation? \nMORTATI (NODS) May God's mercy be upon us. \nCAMERLENGO And the other cardinals? \nMORTATI Await your word. \nThe Camerlengo thinks, feels the weight of this decision on his young shoulders. \nCAMERLENGO May I ask your guidance, Padre? \nMORTATI My belief is we should proceed with the sealing of conclave. \nCAMERLENGO At this hour?        That would be highly unorthodox. \nMORTATI And yet within church law.    It's in my power, I've been chosen Great Elector. \nCAMERLENGO The cruelest honor in Christendom. \nMORTATI The only ambitions I have are for my church.    St. Peter's church, which is under attack at its most vulnerable moment.    This is not a coincidence. Is it possible our enemies hope to distract us from our sacred task? \nCAMERLENGO The church will not fall in a day. We may be wise to consider evacuation. \nMORTATI That is exactly what they want, publicity and panic.    We must not give them oxygen for the media fire. \nCAMERLENGO What of the safety of the cardinals? \nMORTATI Surely there is not an elector present who values his physical being more than the unbroken leadership of the Holy See. \nCAMERLENGO And the people in St. Peter's Square? \nMORTATI They care as deeply about their church as we do.    Their faith will sustain them. \nCAMERLENGO But if their faith does not protect them from an explosion? \nMORTATI We're all bound for heaven eventually, are we not? \nCAMERLENGO Spoken like one who has enjoyed the blessings of a long and full life. \nMortati bristles at the thinly-veiled insult. \nMORTATI Signore, do not confuse the power of the office you temporarily hold with your true place here in the Vatican. You were a favorite of His Holiness, but His Holiness is with his Father now. \nCAMERLENGO Mea culpa. \nSatisfied, Mortati looks back over his shoulder, at the anxious faces in the Chapel.    Then turns back to the Camerlengo. \nMORTATI Seal the doors. \nWith a heavy THUD, the huge doors close and bolts SLAM into place. An ancient key GRINDS in an ornate lock, two heavy chains RATTLE into place, FOUR SWISS GUARD take position in front of the doors and at that very moment -- \n", "test2_true": "-- two huge, modern glass doors WHOOSH open, revealing what looks like a 23rd century library.     It's a massive underground space, like a darkened airplane hangar, with a dozen glass boxes evenly spaced throughout.     They're lit up from within, each containing row upon row of bookshelves, neatly filled with books, papers, and arcana. \nLT. CHARTRAND, a twenty-five year old member of the Swiss Guard (in a suit and earpiece, not the traditional garb), leads Langdon and Vittoria toward the glass enclosures. \nCHARTRAND (Swiss accent) The chambers are hermetic vaults, oxygen is kept at lowest possible levels.    It's a partial vacuum inside. More than ten minutes in the vault is not recommended without breathing apparatus. \nHe stops at one particular chamber and gestures to the sign on its door -- \"Il Processo Galileano.\" \nCHARTRAND (cont'd) I'll be just outside the door. \nLangdon starts toward the entrance to the vault, but Chartrand puts a hand on his chest, stopping him. \nCHARTRAND (cont'd) Watching you, Mr. Langdon. \nLangdon looks at him.    He's not popular around here. \nINT      GALILEO VAULT      DAY \nThe electronic revolving door spins and admits Langdon to the interior of the vault. He takes a deep breath, holds it, and lets it out. \nVittoria follows shortly behind him, and she's unprepared -- the lack of oxygen hits her hard, she dizzies. \nLANGDON Take a moment.     If you feel double vision, double over. \nVITTORIA (bends over) Feels like I'm... scuba diving... with the wrong mixture. \nLANGDON Plenty of time. \nHe checks his watch.   It's 7:07. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Uh... actually, I take that back. \nCUT TO: \nINT     A DARK SPACE       DAY \nIn a dark space, a tea bag bobs delicately up and down in a cup of hot water.    An elegant man in his forties, dressed in a casual suit, no tie, HUMS softly to himself as he steeps his tea.    No idea of his name, but his suit is gray, so how about MR. GRAY. \nThe tea is on an old wooden table, being heated by a small can of sterno.    While Mr. Gray bobs the tea bag, he stares at something to his right. \nMoney.    A lot of it, in a number of different denominations, neatly segmented in a briefcase.    And three passports, all different colors (and nationalities), neatly placed on top of it. \nSatisfied, Mr. Gray CLICKS the briefcase shut and slides it under the table, tucking it up against the wall.    He removes the cup from the heat, still bobbing the tea bag. \nHe walks, lit by candlelight that throws harsh shadows on strange walls.    He heads down a very dark hallway, past a row of stonewalled cells, and within each is the dimly lit figure of the older men we saw on the videotape earlier -- the kidnapped cardinals. \nHe stops at the last cell, where the man, CARDINAL LAMASSE, looks up at him from the wooden bench he's sitting on. \nMR. GRAY You have no idea what you're missing. \nLAMASSE Conclave will go on without us.    The voice of God will not be silenced. \nMR. GRAY I was referring to my tea.    Last chance, I'd be happy to make you a cup. \nLAMASSE May God forgive you for what you've done. \nMR. GRAY Father, if God has issues they won't be with what I've done -- (seems genuinely saddened) -- but with what I'm about to do. \nA MOMENT LATER, \nMr. Gray's hand takes the burning tin of sterno and tosses it into a fireplace, where the liquid fire consumes a pile of dry kindling.    He picks up something else and places it in the heart of the flames. \nA long-handled iron rod. \nCUT TO: \nINT     VATICAN ARCHIVES       DAY \nInside the archive, Vittoria is searching the lower shelves while Langdon, on a ladder, digs through folio bins higher up. \nLANGDON -- confiscated from the Netherlands by the Vatican shortly after Galileo's death.     I've been petitioning to see it for almost ten years.     Ever since I realized what was in it. \nVITTORIA What makes you so sure the Segno is there? \nLANGDON (while searching) The number 503.    I kept seeing it over and over in llluminati letters, scribbled in the margins, or sometimes just signed that way, \"503.\"      It's a numerical clue, but to what?     Five, of course, is the sacred llluminati number -- the pentagram, Pythagoras, a dozen other examples in science -- but why three? (MORE) \nLANGDON (cont'd) It made no sense. And then I thought -- what if it were a Roman numeral? \nVITTORIA (THINKS) D-I-I-I? \nLANGDON D3.   Galileo's third text. (ticking them off) Dialogo.    Discorsi. \nHis eyes light up as he pulls a slender volume out of a folio bin on one of the top shelves. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Diagramma. \nA MOMENT LATER, \nLangdon, now wearing white cotton gloves, sets the tiny manuscript on a viewing stand. \nLANGDON Diagramma della Verita.        The Diagram of Truth. \nVITTORIA I know about Dialogo and Discorsi -- Galileo laid out his theories about the earth revolving around the sun, and the church forced him to recant. But what was this? \nLANGDON This is where he got the word out. The truth, not what the Vatican forced him to write.    Smuggled out of Rome and printed in Holland on sedge papyrus. That way any scientists caught with a copy could simply drop it in water and the booklet would dissolve. \nCarefully, he turns the first page. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Between its delicate nature and the Vatican burnings, it's said this is the only copy that remains. (turns the second page) (MORE) \nLANGDON (cont'd) And if I'm right the Segno should be hidden -- (and the third) -- on page number -- (and the fourth) -- five. \n", "test3_input": "LANGDON Pyramids.      In a Catholic church. This is it. \nBehind them, the plastic rustles, as if drawn by a wind, and as Langdon turns, he hears, faintly, a DOOR CLOSING far away. \nHe turns back, eyes drawn to the floor.    There is a large oval medallion there, with a skeleton carved into it.    It's slightly off center, raised.    As if it's been opened recently, and hurriedly replaced. \nLANGDON (cont'd) The demon's hole. \nIN THE DEMON'S HOLE, \nwe're looking up now as the medallion GRINDS to the side.     Faces peer down at us -- Langdon, Vittoria, Olivetti, and Vincenzo. They recoil from a stench. \nUP TOP, \nLangdon squints, trying to see inside. \nLANGDON Anybody got a flashlight? \nVincenzo hands him one.    Langdon shines it down into the crypt. There are shapes, but thirty feet down and hard to make out. \nThere's one in particular, in the darkness, seems too short to be a person, but it's moving slightly. \nOLIVETTI Can you tell what it is? \nLANGDON Not from up here. \nHe reaches down, rattles the ladder that leans against the wall of the crypt.    Takes a deep breath, looks at the others. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Those guns.          Keep 'em handy? \nIN THE DEMON'S HOLE, \nLangdon reaches the bottom, still shining the light at the figure in the distance.    It's brighter here, he can see it's flesh- colored, but still indistinct.    He takes a step toward it -- \n-- and something CRUNCHES under his feet. \nHe shines the light down.    He's standing on a pile of human skulls \nOLIVETTI (calling down) You okay? \nLANGDON More or less. \nHe takes two more steps, closer to the swaying figure on the other side of the crypt.    He can now clearly see a man's naked back. \nLANGDON (cont'd) He's here!    I think he's -- sitting. (moves closer) Hello? (closer still) Are you all right? \nIt's a human figure.     As Langdon draws close, he sees the source of the movement --- rats, gnawing at the dead body. \nThey scurry away as Langdon comes around the front, and we pull back to see what he sees. \nIt's Cardinal Lamasse. \nHe's been buried in the earthen floor of the crypt up to his waist his jaw broken, his mouth crammed full of dirt. \nBut that's not the worst of it.    Langdon GAGS as he sees the blackened word that has been branded into the red flesh of the Cardinal's chest.    It's an ambigram, like we've seen before, but this time it says -- \nEARTH. \nCUT TO: \nINT     SISTINE CHAPEL      DAY \nCardinal Mortati sits regally at the main altar at the front of the Sistine Chapel as the electors, one by one, cast their votes in the traditional manner. \nAn AFRICAN CARDINAL at the front of the line kneels before him. \nAFRICAN CARDINAL (SUBTITLED) I call as my witness Christ the Lord, who will be my judge that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected. \nThe African Cardinal stands, holds his ballot over his head, t lowers the ballot to the altar, where a plate sits atop a large chalice. \nHe places the ballot on the plate, then picks up the plate and uses it to drop the ballot in the chalice.    He then replaces the plate over the chalice, bows to the cross, and heads for his seat. \nThe next cardinal steps up to repeat the process. \nA SHORT TIME LATER, A DISSOLVE, \nand the line is gone.    Mortati holds the chalice with all the votes.    He shakes it, chooses one--- \nMORTATI Eligo in summum pontificem -- \n-- and reads an unfamiliar name. \nHe makes a note in a ledger, then raises a threaded needle and pierces the ballot through the word \"Eligo,\" sliding the ballot on the thread. \nA SHORT TIME LATER,   ANOTHER DISSOLVE, \nand there are a hundred and sixty-one ballots on the thread, Mortati looks up from his ledger and speaks to the room. \nMORTATI The first ballot has failed. \nHe takes He thread carrying all the ballots and ties the ends together to create a ring. \nHe lays the ring of ballots on a silver tray.     Dusts the tray heavily with a yellowish powder. \nA DOOR OPENS \non a small incinerator. The ring of ballots is hurled inside and bursts immediately into flame. \nA dark, brackish smoke billows up from the burning ballots, and we follow the smoke up, up, into the chimney -- \nEXT     ST.   PETER'S SQUARE         DUSK \n--- and to the roof of the Sistine Chapel, where the black iUPke puffs out into the early evening sky. \n", "test3_true": "But while they are all watching the smoke, we turn our attention? to the opposite direction, to the east, across Rome, to where --- \nCUT TO: \nEXT     PIAZZA DEL POPOLO        DUSK \n--- those black Alfa Romeos, four this time, glide silently to a halt outside the church where Langdon just found the corpse. Swiss Guard in black suits pour out of the vehicles and hurry into the church, trying to attract as little attention as possible. \nINT     SANTA MARIA DEL POPOLO          DUSK \nThe inside of the church is being sealed off as a crime scene. Rocher, just arriving, takes charge as the plastic is RIPPED off the Chigi Chapel. \nROCHER Get that body out of there and search the rest of the building. \nSwiss Guardsmen drop into the demon's hole to remove the body. \nROCHER (cont'd) (to another Guardsman) Outside -- a perimeter.    Secure but invisible.     No lights, no guns, no one knows.     Understood? \nLangdon, lost in thought, drifts through the small chapel, studying the intricate carvings and other artwork. \nLANGDON Earthly symbology... everywhere... \nRocher passes through his field of vision, livid: \nROCHER Why the hell didn't you figure this out in the first place? \nIt was more a rhetorical question, but Langdon answers honestly, still lost in thought, his voice soft. \nLANGDON I made a mistake. \nHe drifts toward a statue, of the highest quality white marble, resting in a niche on the far side, out of the way of the mayhem. \nVittoria joins him. \nVITTORIA Is it Raphael? \nLANGDON The chapel is.     But the sculptures are Bernini. (STUNNED) The unknown Illuminati master was Bernini. \nVITTORIA Didn't he work for the Church? \nLANGDON Almost exclusively.    It means the Illuminati even infiltrated the Vatican.    They hid in plain sight. \nHe steps closer to the statue.    It's of two life-size human figures, intertwined, one a regal, bearded man, the other a cherub, floating overhead. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Habakkuk and the Angel. \nVITTORIA Habakkuk? \nLANGDON The prophet who predicted the annihilation of the earth.    This is the first marker. \nHe steps closer, studying it carefully. \nLANGDON (cont'd) \"Let angels guide you on your lofty quest...\" \nHis eyes move slowly over the statue, and ours do too, from the angel's innocent face, down his arm, and to his right hand, which is outstretched, one finger extended -- \n-- pointing the way. \nLANGDON (cont'd) The Path is alive. \nCUT TO: \nEXT     PIAZZA DEL POPOLO        DUSK \nLangdon dashes down the stairs outside the church and into the middle of the piazza.    It's getting dark now, shadows streaking the square. \nLANGDON Southwest...   it points southwest... \nHe gets his bearings, looks to the southwest, sees nothing but buildings in the way. \nHe runs back up the church steps, where Vittoria and Rocher are just coming outside.    Langdon's mind is racing. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Earth-air-fire-water, we're looking for a Bernini sculpture having something to do with air... (to Rocher) And the next church is southwest of here. \nROCHER You're sure this time? \nLANGDON I need a map.    One that shows all the churches in Rome. \nRocher just stares at him, studying him. \nLANGDON (cont'd) I could use it now. \nRocher starts down the steps toward his car. \nLANGDON (cont'd) And a compass! \nHe looks around, sees the rickety scaffolding outside the church, and --- \nA MOMENT LATER, \n--- he climbs into our view, now on the scaffolding.       He's moving upward, fast, toward --- \nEXT     CHURCH ROOF       DUSK \n--- the roof of the old church, also undergoing renovation. The view of Rome is spectacular from up here, and Langdon rushes to the western wall, looking intently off in that direction. \nHe sees something that makes him suck in his breath, hears a voice from behind him --- \nVITTORIA   (O.S.) Robert! \n--- and turns as Vittoria tosses something small and black up to him. \n"}

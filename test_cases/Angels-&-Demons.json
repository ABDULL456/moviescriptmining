{"test1_input": "CUT TO: \nEXT     VATICAN ARCHIVES      NIGHT \nThe face of Langdon's Mickey Mouse watch is smeared with blood from a cut on his hand, but we can still read the time. \nIt's 9:41. \nLangdon and Chartrand stagger down the front steps of the Vatican Archives, where they're immediately met by three Vatican Police cars.    Olivetti leaps out of one and meets them at the base of the steps, holding his hands up in defense almost before Langdon can lay into him. \nLANGDON Are you out of your minds?! \nOLIVETTI Please.    In the car. \nLANGDON Someone tried to kill me. \nOLIVETTI Do you know where the next church is? \nLANGDON Yes. \nOLIVETTI Then get in the car! \nLangdon jumps in the back seat of the car with Olivetti, and they SQUEAL away from the Archives. \nIN THE CAR, \nthey continue as the DRIVER tears through the streets of Rome. \nOLIVETTI We had no idea that -- \nLANGDON You heard me ask permission!    You assigned me an escort!    Don't try to tell me you didn't know I was in there! \nOLIVETTI (let me finish) Of course I knew, but we had no idea that portions of our white zones are \nOLIVETTI (cont'd) cross-wired with that building. Commander Rocher was extending the search, if he'd known the Archives were on that grid, he never would have killed the power. \nLangdon looks at him evenly, sees in Olivetti's eyes that they may be thinking the same thing. \nLANGDON Or there is the other possibility. \nOlivetti doesn't answer.     But he's thinking about it. \nLANGDON (cont'd) Infiltration is the Illuminati specialty -- why not the head of the Swiss Guard? \nOLIVETTI (AGONIZED) Perhaps. \nLANGDON I want to speak to the Camerlengo. \nOLIVETTI Il Camerlengo is unavailable, \nLANGDON Unavailable?        Why? \nOLIVETTI He's found evidence that the Holy Father was indeed murdered.    He is seeking guidance. \nLANGDON From whom? \nOlivetti looks at him   -- what are you, an idiot? \nOLIVETTI From God. \nLANGDON Oh, right. \nOLIVETTI Please.      Make an effort. \nCUT TO: \nINT     PAPAL OFFICE      NIGHT \nVittoria, escorted by the two Swiss Guardsmen from the grottoes, returns to the papal office. \nShe goes to the desk where she was sitting earlier, to resume her examination of the journals. \nBut the desk is bare. \nVITTORIA The journals.        Where are they? \nThe Guardsmen look at her blankly. \nVITTORIA   (cont'd) Who took the journals from this desk?! \nINT      APOSTOLIC PALACE - GREAT STAIRCASE        NIGHT \nThe Camerlengo, in deep meditation, slowly descends the stairs that lead to the Sistine Chapel. \nAt the bottom, Four Swiss Guard (in traditional garb) guard the locked doors. \nThe Camerlengo reaches them.    Hesitates.      Looks heavenward for one last word of encouragement, and then -- \nCAMERLENGO Unseal the doors. \nINT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT \nThere is an audible GASP from the assembled cardinals as the heavy locks CLUNK open, the chains RATTLE away, and the main doors of the Sistine Chapel sweep open. \nThe Camerlengo walks in, a stark presence in his black cassock amid the sea of red robes. Cardinal Mortati steps from behind the altar to meet him. \nMORTATI Signore, do you realize that for the first time in Vatican history, a Camerlengo has just crossed the sacred threshold of conclave after sealing the doors? \nCUT TO: \nCAMERLENGO There has been a development. \nEXT      ROME - STREET      NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT \nThe Camerlengo has just passed on the shocking news, and the whispered word \"murder\" can be heard in several languages. \nEven Mortati is shaken.   The Camerlengo speaks to the Cardinals. \nCAMERLENGO Please... a moment... if I... \nHe strides quickly up the steps of the altar to address the group -- again, to the shock and surprise of this most conservative and rule-bound group. \nBut no one stops him. \nCAMERLENGO   (cont'd) It is true we are under attack from an old enemy.    And this time they've struck from within, murdering our Holy Father and threatening us all with destruction at the hands of their new god, science.    So what are we to do? \nINT      OLIVETTI'S CAR      NIGHT \nCLOSE ON the dashboard clock in Olivetti's car, which now reads 8:57.    Langdon looks up from it, staring intently through the windshield. \nOn the horizon, he sees a faint orange glow. \nLANGDON Oh no. \nINT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT \nThe Camerlengo continues, and the cardinals are listening. \nCAMERLENGO Since the days of Galileo, the church has tried to slow the relentless march of science, sometimes with misguided means, but always with benevolent intention.    Still, they call us backward, ignorant. \nCAMERLENGO   (cont'd) But who is more ignorant?   The man who cannot define lightning, or the man who does not respect its awesome power? \nINT      OLIVETTI'S CAR      NIGHT \nThrough the windshield of Olivetti's car, we see that orange glow, closer now.    It's a building on fire. \nINT      SISTINE CHAPEL      NIGHT \nThe Camerlengo continues, growing passionate. \nCAMERLENGO The promises of science have not been kept.    We're a fractured and frantic species, moving down of destruction in the name of progress. \nEXT     SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA       NIGHT \nThe police cars come to an abrupt stop in front of the Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria.    Flames glow like evil eyes through the stained-glass windows fifty feet above the ground. \nA small CROWD has gathered, stabbing at their cell phones.    A SIREN WAILS in the distance. \nINT      SISTINE CHAPEL      NIGHT \nMortati's Aide, Father Simeon, takes advantage of the open Sistine Chapel doors and slips inside.    He takes a place just behind Mortati as the Camerlengo goes on. \nCAMERLENGO Science and religion are not enemies. But there are things that science is simply too young to understand.    We are here to lead, but how? \nEXT     SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA       NIGHT \nWith three sharp CRACKS, Olivetti fires into the lock in the front door of the church.    He KICKS it open -- \n-- and flame RIPS out into the night air. \nINT      SISTINE CHAPEL      NIGHT \nThe Camerlengo speaks faster now: \nCAMERLENGO Shall we cloak ourselves in silence and secrecy, as in the past?    Or do we open the doors, take down the blackened curtains, and speak to our flock? \nINT     SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA       NIGHT \nOlivetti, Langdon, and four other VATICAN POLICE make their way into the burning church.    There is a massive pile of church pews in the center aisle, burning wildly. \nINT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT \nThe Camerlengo's wrapping up: \nCAMERLENGO Signores, I ask, no, I pray that you break this conclave.    Open the doors. \nINT     SANTA MARIA DELLA VITTORIA       NIGHT \nIn the burning church, two heavy incensor cables run from the walls of the church and rise above the burning pews at an angle, strung tightly to a center point.    Langdon follows the wires up with his eyes -- \nINT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT \nCAMERLENGO Evacuate St. Peter's Square. \nINT     BURNING CHURCH       NIGHT \n-- the wires meet at a center point, just above the roaring flames, where -- \nINT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT \nCAMERLENGO Tell the world the truth. \nINT      BURNING CHURCH     NIGHT \n-- the third cardinal, still alive, is suspended over the searing flames. \nA word is branded into the center of his bared chest: \nFIRE. \nVatican Police, led by Olivetti and Vincenzo, race into the building and draw their weapons.    Olivetti SHOUTS to them in Italian, looking for a way to cut down the agonized cardinal. \nLangdon races toward the pyre, but is repelled by a wall of heat ten feet away. \n", "test1_id": 1413, "test2_input": "INT      APOSTOLIC PALACE - HALLWAY            NIGHT \nCommander Rocher, eyes dead-set, walks down a hallway in the Apostolic Palace.    He passes two Swiss Guardsmen with radios. \nROCHER Get on the radio and put the word out. Conclave is to remain sealed. \nSWISS GUARDSMAN But the Camerlengo gave the order for evacuation at eleven fif- \nROCHER I'm countermanding it. \nSWISS GUARDSMAN BUT- \nROCHER That door stays SHUT! Do you understand? \nSWISS GUARDSMAN Yes sir. \nRocher keeps walking. \nCUT TO: \nINT   CHURCH OF ILLUMINATION    NIGHT \nLangdon and Vittoria creep into the Church of Illumination, and we get our first good look at it. \nThe embellishments, though faded, are replete with familiar symbology.    Pentagram tiles.    Planet frescoes.    Pyramids. \nVITTORIA We have thirty minutes left, I can still change the battery if we can find the cannister. \nLangdon nods, but he's fascinated by the place. \nIn the center of the room, there is an open fireplace, its embers still smoking.    The four Illuminati brands, their faces wiped clean, have been placed back in a molded velvet case. \nLangdon, fascinated, spots an empty slot in the very center of the case, surrounded by the four used brands. \nBut this one's missing. \nVittoria arrives over his shoulder, having completed a quick search of the place. \nVITTORIA   (cont'd) It isn't here. \nLANGDON There's a fifth brand. \nVITTORIA What? \nHe touches the indentation in the velvet, puzzling it out. \nLANGDON Two crossed keys. \nVITTORIA The symbol for the Vatican? \nLANGDON The papacy. (THINKING) They're going to kill him.    Before they blow up the Vatican they're going to kill and brand the pope himself. \nVITTORIA But there is no pope. \nLANGDON Technically, there is. \nVITTORIA The Camerlengo?!    We have to- \nMR. GRAY (O.S.) Please place your gun on the floor. \nThey freeze. Vittoria looks at Langdon, who nods     -- you'd better do it.    She does. \nMR. GRAY       (cont'd) Now turn around. \nThey turn and face Mr. Gray.    He looks quite dapper, and not too much the worse for wear.    There is a briefcase on the ground beside him, and he's changed into a fresh shirt. \nMR. GRAY   (cont'd) Kick it to me. \nShe does.    He picks it up, ejects the clip and the round in the chamber, pockets them, and tosses the gun into the smoldering fire. \nLANGDON You could have been long gone by now. \nMR. GRAY Some do God's work for love, others for money.    Which do you take me for? \nAs if to answer his own question, he picks up the briefcase from the floor beside him.    Then studies Langdon for a moment. \nMR. GRAY You're not one of them. \nLANGDON Neither are you. I was expecting a fanatic. \nMR. GRAY When they call me -- and they all call me -- it is so important to them that I know what they ask is the Lord's will.    Or Allah's, or Yahweh's.    And I suppose they're right.    Because if He were not vengeful, I would not exist, would I? \nHe picks up his briefcase. \nMR. GRAY (cont'd) Be careful.        These are men of God. \nHe turns to go.    Langdon can't help himself: \nLANGDON Why didn't you kill us when you had the chancer \nVittoria looks at Langdon like he's nuts.        Mr. Gray turns back, seems puzzled by the very thought. \nMR. GRAY Because no one asked me to. \nHe leaves. \nLangdon and Vittoria pause for a moment, look at each other     -- \nLANGDON We've got to get to the Vatican. \nCUT TO: \nINT     PAPAL OFFICES - HALLWAY          NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "Another Swiss Guardsman steps out of the office, reporting back from within. \nSWISS GUARDSMAN The Camerlengo says he will grant you an audience. \nROCHER I'd like to see him alone. \nThe Swiss Guards look at each other. \nSWISS GUARDSMAN That's impossible, sir.    No one- \nROCHER Have you forgotten who you work for?! \nRocher is truly intimidating when he wants to be. \nSWISS GUARDSMAN No,   sir. \nHe nods to the other Guards, who raise their swords, allowing access. \nCUT TO: \nINT     SECRET PASSAGE         NIGHT \nVittoria and Langdon barrel down the stone stairs, into the passage, and through the open doorway to Il Passetto. \nINT     IL PASSETTO      NIGHT \nThe passetto is narrow and dark, lit only by streaks of moonlight coming through the vertical slits in the walls. \nBut up ahead, there's light.      They race for it. \nCUT TO: \nINT     OFFICE OF THE POPE            NIGHT \nThe Camerlengo kneels in prayer in front of the fire. He hears a sound behind him and turns as the door to the papal office opens. \nRocher enters, closes and locks the door behind him. \nCAMERLENGO Have you come to make me a martyr? \nCUT TO: \nINT/EXT       IL PASSETTO       NIGHT \nVittoria and Langdon race up a flight of stairs, and the passetto comes out into the open for a hundred yards or so as it leaves the Castel Sant'Angelo. \nAhead, they see a rope ladder over the side.        They look down. \nDirectly below them, Mr. Gray is getting into an Alfa Romeo parked discretely at the end of a dead end street, making his escape. \nDOWN ON THE STREET, \nthe car door SLAMS. \nIN THE CAR, \nMr. Gray turns the key. \nUP ON THE PASSETTO, \nLangdon and Vittoria are running toward the Vatican again when the EXPLOSION rips through the still night. \nThey stagger and turn back, in time to see Mr. Gray's car go up in an enormous fireball. \nVITTORIA Men of God. \nLangdon grabs her arm and they take off.        The Passetto descends again, into -- \nINT       IL PASSETTO       NIGHT \n-- another underground space.        The outline of a steel gate looms ahead, blocking their way. \nBut as they draw closer, they find the ancient lock hanging open, and the gate swings freely.    This tunnel has been used, and recently. \nFURTHER AHEAD, \nthey plow onward, and now there is a low ROARING sound from above them.    Langdon pauses, looks up. \nLANGDON We're under St. Peter's Square. \nThey keep on. \nCUT TO: \nINT      PAPAL OFFICES - HALLWAY      NIGHT \nIn the hallway outside the Pope's office, there are raised VOICES from behind the closed door.    Lt. Chartrand approaches nervously. \nHe and the Guards look at each other, don't know what to do. From the other direction, Father Simeon, Cardinal Mortati's Aide, strides toward them. \nFR. SIMEON I demand to speak to the Camerlengo. \nAN ANGRY SHOUT from behind the door draws their attention --what the hell is going on in there? \nCUT TO: \nINT      IL PASSETTO      NIGHT \nLangdon and Vittoria hit another gate, this one heavier, but it too is unlocked.    The sound of St. Peter's Square fades behind them now. \nUP AHEAD, \n", "test2_id": 1414, "test3_input": "LANGDON Do I have someone to tell it to? \nShe smiles and kisses the back of his hand          -- yes.        A ROAR comes from outside and we see -- \nEXT      ST.   PETER'S SQUARE           NIGHT \n-- the crowd in St. Peter's Square, in rapture. There is SINGING, there's CHANTING of the Camerlengo's name.    It's exactly midnight. \nINT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT \nIn the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Mortati is in hushed, urgent conversation with a group of seven or eight Cardinals. \nMORTATI Signores... you are no doubt aware that by Holy Law the man is ineligible for election to the papacy.    He is not a cardinal, he is a priest, a chamberlain.    And there is the matter of his inadequate age.    I'm sorry, the protocols of conclave are not subject to modification.    I will not call a ballot on this matter. \nThe African Cardinal who cast his vote earlier speaks up. \nAFRICAN CARDINAL But Signore, you would not call the ballot.    Surely you remember -- you gave up your post as Great Elector. \nMortati looks at him.    Boxed into a corner. \nOutside, the crowd in St. Peter's can be heard, singing joyously. \nA SECOND CARDINAL steps forward. \nSECOND CARDINAL They are singing in St. Peter's Square!   What happened here tonight transcends our laws! \nMORTATI Does it?    Is it God's will that we abandon reason and give ourselves over to frenzy?   Discard the rules of the church? \nA THIRD CARDINAL now, a peacemaker: \nTHIRD CARDINAL Perhaps they need not be discarded. \nThey all look at him. \nTHIRD CARDINAL   (cont'd) I am thinking now of Romano Pontifici Eligendo, Numero 63. \nMost of the Cardinals look puzzled -- but Mortati's face darkens. \nTHIRD CARDINAL (cont'd) Balloting is not the only method by which a Pope can be elected.    There is another, more divine method. \nMORTATI \"Acclimation by Adoration.\" \nTHIRD CARDINAL Si, signore! \nThe Second Cardinal sparks to this idea. \nSECOND CARDINAL Of course! (answering those around him who look confused) Election by Adoration occurs when all the cardinals, as if by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, freely and spontaneously, unanimously and aloud, proclaim one individual's name. \nTHIRD CARDINAL And the law states that Adoration supersedes all other eligibility requirements.    The candidate need only be an ordained member of the clergy. (DRAMATICALLY) BUT! (they listen) He must be present in the Sistine Chapel at the moment of election. \nMany cries now of \"Bring the Camerlengo to us!\" \nMortati looks deeply troubled. \nCUT TO: \nINT     ROCHER'S OFFICE      NIGHT \nBandaged now, Langdon and Vittoria are ushered into Rocher's office by a Swiss Guardsman. \nSWISS GUARDSMAN Please wait here while we arrange your transportation.    May I get you anything? \nThey shake their heads, no thanks.        Settle into chairs to the side of Rocher's desk. \nThey look uncomfortable   -- it's weird to be in a dead man's office. \nVittoria looks at his desk.     Thinks of something. \nShe gets up and goes to it, running her hand lightly over it. \nLANGDON What are you doing? \nVITTORIA Leonardo's journals.          I want them back. \nShe feels in the surface of the desk and finds the square outline of the inlaid panel where Rocher hid the journals.    She tries prying it open, but that doesn't work, she tries pushing down on the front of it -- \n-- and the panel slowly rotates open.    The journals, which were laid on top of the television monitor, slide out and onto the desk. \nVittoria scoops them up and is about to close the panel again when -- \nLANGDON Wait a minute. \nHe looks down at the monitor.        Thinking. \nAt its odd, key-shaped on/off switch. \nHe pulls something from his pocket      -- the key Rocher gave him, just as he died. \nIN LANGDON'S MIND, \nhe sees Rocher's face, looking up at him, dying: \nROCHER For safety. \nBACK IN THE OFFICE, \nLangdon looks at the key, and its odd shape.    Looks down at the monitor, the same odd shape where its switch should be. \nIN LANGDON'S MIND, \nthey're back in the Pope's office, but Rocher is alive, and saying words he said earlier: \nROCHER The Holy Father was subject to seizures... but he took steps. \n", "test3_true": "Rocher's voice continues over, but Langdon mouths the words as he remembers them: \nROCHER'S VOICE (O.S.) \"MADE SURE HE WAS WATCHED.\" \nIN LANGDON'S MIND, \nRocher is back in the office again, finishing his sentence: \nROCHER For safety. \nIN ROCHER'S OFFICE, \nLangdon holds the key up, repeating those last words: \nLANGDON For safety. \nHe lowers the key to the monitor, extending it toward the keyhole \n-- and it's a perfect fit.      He twists it. \nAnd with a ZZZZT of power, the monitor winks to life.   An image comes into focus. \nVITTORIA Where's that? \nLANGDON That...is the papal office. \nOn the monitor, \nthey are indeed looking at an image of the Pope's office.    There are two dead bodies on the floor, covered with sheets, and VATICAN POLICE are photographing everything.    Must be live. \nIN ROCHER'S OFFICE, \nLangdon's figuring it out. \nLANGDON The Pope spent a lot of time in contemplation, alone.    If he was worried about seizures, he must have asked Rocher to install a camera without telling anyone.    To keep an eye on him.    For safety.    And maybe -- \nHe reaches down to the screen, toward a touch panel at the bottom. \nYou don't have to be a symbologist to understand these symbols- play, pause, fast forward. \nAnd rewind.   Langdon touches it. \nON THE MONITOR, \nthe image ZIPS backwards, rapidly, to the shooting, and the all the way back to when Rocher and the Camerlengo were alone together. Rocher stands just behind him, the Camerlengo still kneels before the fireplace. \nAs the image starts to play forward, in real time, we go in close on the monitor and come out -- \nINT     POPE'S OFFICE       NIGHT \n-- in the papal office, to watch the scene in person. \nCAMERLENGO The scientist kept journals?      So? \nROCHER You figure prominently in them. \nThe Camerlengo turns his eyes back to the flames, stirring the embers with a poker. \nCAMERLENGO Really. \nROCHER Leonardo wasn't just a physicist, he was a Catholic priest.    Deeply conflicted about the implications of his work and in need of spiritual guidance.    About a month ago, he requested an audience with the Pope. But you'd know that, because you granted the audience, and were present during it. \nThe Camerlengo twists the poker in the fire.     Speaks softly. \nCAMERLENGO The fool thought he had duplicated the moment of creation. \nROCHER And the Holy Father urged him to go public.    His Holiness thought the discovery might actually prove the existence of a divine power -- begin to bridge the gap between religion and science. \nCAMERLENGO Science.    The new God.    Ignore the weapons and chaos and madness. \nThe Camerlengo looks up at him, and his expression is different than we've ever seen it.    Contemptuous.    Angry.    Violent. \nCAMERLENGO (cont'd) His work was not religious, it was sacrilegious! \nROCHER But you saw the Pope's position as a softening of church law.    An old man's weakness.    Your father's weakness. \nCAMERLENGO He raised me to protect the church. Even from within. \nROCHER So you brought an old enemy back from the dead to frighten people. \nCAMERLENGO Nothing unites hearts like the presence of evil. \nROCHER It didn't work, Father. \nCAMERLENGO It isn't finished. \nROCHER I've informed Father Simeon of what I learned and he'll get word to the Cardinals the moment conclave opens. \nThe Camerlengo looks at him calmly for a moment   -- \nCAMERLENGO I was planning on doing this alone. \n-- and then removes the poker from the fire. But it isn't a poker, it's a long-handled brand, with a cross of some kind at the end. \nRocher pulls his gun, holds it at his side. \nROCHER Put that down. \nThe Camerlengo rips open his cassock with his free hand. \nCAMERLENGO But perhaps it's better that you're here. \n", "test3_id": 1415}

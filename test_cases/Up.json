{"train": "UP \nWritten by \nPete Docter, Bob Peterson & Thomas McCarthy \nA 1930's NEWSREEL. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) \"Movietown News\" presents... Spotlight on Adventure! \nThe mysterious SOUTH AMERICAN JUNGLE. A massive waterfall cascades down a gigantic, flat-topped mountain. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) What you are now witnessing is footage never before seen by civilized humanity: a lost world in South America! Lurking in the shadow of majestic Paradise Falls, it sports plants and animals undiscovered by science. Who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit? \nA painted portrait of a dashing young adventurer. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Why, our subject today: Charles Muntz! \nA massive DIRIGIBLE descends on an airfield. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The beloved explorer lands his dirigible, the \"Spirit of Adventure,\" in New Hampshire this week, completing a year long expedition to the lost world! \nINT. MOVIE THEATRE - CONTINUOUS \nOf everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no one is more enthralled than 8 year old CARL FREDRICKSEN. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (O.S.) This lighter-than-air craft was designed by Muntz himself, and is longer than 22 Prohibition paddy- wagons placed end to end. \nYoung Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And here comes the adventurer now! \nNEWSREEL FOOTAGE: the dashing Muntz descends down the gangplank to the delight of the crowd. His dogs trail him. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Never apart from his faithful dogs, Muntz conceived the craft for canine comfort! It's a veritable floating palace in the sky... \nAn opulent dining room. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...complete with doggie bath and mechanical canine walker. \nOne dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals consider Muntz the bee's knees! And how! \nCameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature \"thumbs up\" stance. \nMUNTZ \"Adventure is out there!\" \nIn the theater, Young Carl returns the thumbs up. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) But what has Muntz brought back this time? \nMuntz speaks to a crowded auditorium, on stage beside a curtained object. \nMUNTZ Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster of Paradise Falls! \nHe pulls away the drape to reveal a GIANT BIRD SKELETON. \nCROWD Ooh! Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And golly, what a swell monster this is. But what's this? \nSkeptical scientists analyze the bones. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Scientists cry foul! The National Explorers Society accuses Muntz of fabricating the skeleton! \nYOUNG CARL No! \nMuntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other famous explorers. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The organization strips Muntz of his membership. \nMuntz's \"Explorer's Society\" badge is ceremoniously RIPPED from his jacket. Carl GASPS. \nMuntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield.       He grimly addresses the crowd. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast... alive! \nCarl FUMPHERS. \nYOUNG ELLIE Alright, you're in. Welcome aboard. She offers her hand.   Carl looks down, embarrassed. \nYOUNG ELLIE What's wrong? Can't you talk? Carl is frozen.   Ellie softens. \nYOUNG ELLIE Hey, I don't bite. She takes off her helmet.   Her hair frizzes out in all directions. She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and pins it on Carl. \nYOUNG ELLIE You and me, we're in a club now. \nCarl smiles. \nYOUNG ELLIE I saw where your balloon went. Come on, let's go get it! \nCarl watches her stride out of the room.   She pops back in. \nYOUNG ELLIE My name's Ellie. \nShe grabs his hand. Carl blushes as she pulls him out of the room. \nINT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, UPSTAIRS \nYOUNG ELLIE There it is. \nCarl and Ellie look across the attic at the balloon. Between them the floor has collapsed, save one rickety beam. Carl GULPS. \nYOUNG ELLIE Well, go ahead. She pushes him out onto the beam. \nYOUNG ELLIE Go on. \nCarl steels his courage. He puts on his goggles, starts forward... and FALLS through the floor. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SMALL TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY \nAmbulance.    SIREN blaring. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nOne lone light on upstairs. \nINT. CARL'S ROOM \nCarl in bed, reading a book by flashlight, his arm in a CAST. \nInto the room floats Carl's lost BLUE BALLOON. Carl jumps and CALLS OUT in fright. \nYOUNG CARL (re: arm) Ow! \nA head pops up from outside the open window. \nYOUNG ELLIE Hey kid!! \nCarl SCREAMS, hitting himself in the face with the cast. \nYOUNG CARL Ow!! \nEllie climbs in the window. \nYOUNG ELLIE Thought you might need a little cheerin' up. I got somethin' to show ya! \nINT. CARL'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nThe two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight.   Ellie whispers, as if to protect a National Secret. \nYOUNG ELLIE I am about to let you see something I have never shown to another human being. Ever. In my life. Carl's eyes widen in alarm. \nYOUNG ELLIE You'll have to swear you will not tell anyone. Carl nods. \nYOUNG ELLIE Cross your heart. Do it! Carl crosses.    Ellie unveils... \nYOUNG ELLIE My Adventure Book! It's a reused photo album with the words \"My Adventure Book\" written across it. She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz. \nYOUNG ELLIE You know him. Carl smiles excitedly. \nYOUNG ELLIE Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get big, I'm going where he's going: South America. She turns the page to a map. \nEXT. ZOO - DAY \nEllie emerges from the South America House, dressed in her Zookeeper's uniform. \nCarl shows off his new BALLOON CART and uniform. Behind him the balloons lift his cart off the ground. Carl jumps to catch it. She giggles. \nINT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY \nCarl and Ellie sit side by side in their chairs, reading. Without looking up from their books, they hold hands. \nEXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - DAY \nAgain at their picnic spot, they watch clouds. Ellie sees an elephant with wings. Carl gives it a try and points out a BABY. Ellie lights up, excited. She sees ALL the clouds as babies! Carl is stunned... but smiles. \nINT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, BABY ROOM - DAY \nEllie finishes painting a wall mural of a stork carrying a bundle in its beak. Carl hangs a mobile above the crib. \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON \nCarl touches Ellie's shoulder as the doctor explains.   Ellie drops her head in her hands. \nEXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nCarl looks out the window.   Ellie sits alone under a tree, the wind in her hair. \nEXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, YARD - AFTERNOON \nCarl joins Ellie.   He hands her the Adventure Book. She smiles. \nINT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nEllie paints a MURAL of their house atop Paradise Falls over the mantle. Carl organizes a compass, map, binoculars, and native bird figurine beneath the painting. It's their shrine to Adventure. \nINT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nCarl sets A JAR on a table, \"PARADISE FALLS\" written on it. Ellie drops in a few coins. She looks at Carl and crosses her heart. Carl crosses his. \nA SERIES OF SHOTS \nThe jar slowly fills as Carl and Ellie toss in spare change. Their car blows a tire. The two stand by the jar, reluctant.   Carl BREAKS the jar. \nNew tire. \nCarl in the hospital with a broken leg. \nBreaking jar. A storm rages.   A tree falls, crushing the roof. \nBreaking jar. \nINT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - MORNING \nCarl struggles to tie his tie.   Ellie helps.   They walk out the front door arm in arm. \nINT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - 3 YEARS LATER \nEllie struggles to tie Carl's tie as they rush out the door. \nA SERIES OF SHOTS as Ellie straightens Carl's ties.    Stylish 1950's ties. Wide 60's ties. Paisley 70's ties. \nINT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - 30 YEARS LATER \nOlder Carl and Ellie smile at themselves in the hall mirror. \nEXT. ZOO - DAY \nCarl in his 60's. They still work happily side by side at the zoo. Carl's cart lifts off the ground. He casually leans an elbow on it. \nINT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCarl and Ellie dance in the evening candlelight. The PARADISE FALLS JAR sits off to the side, now dusty and forgotten. \nINT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM WINDOW - AFTERNOON \nCarl cleans the inside of the window.    Ellie cleans the outside. \nINT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nCarl's house is the lone surviving square on the block not under construction. Machinery and workers circle busily. High rise buildings are being erected all around. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - MORNING \nCarl looks at the activity around him. \nCARL Quite a sight, huh Ellie? (noticing mailbox) Uhp, mail's here. \nCarl walks to the mailbox.    He touches Ellie's faded HANDPRINT and smiles. \nHe looks through the mail. \nHe sees a SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE pamphlet full of images of happy old people. Carl scoffs. \nCARL Shady Oaks Retirement.    Oh brother. \nCarl notices DUST on his mailbox. \nCARL Hm. \nHe pulls up a LEAF BLOWER.   He revs it and blasts off the dust. \nTOM, the CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN, notices. \nCONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM Hey! `Morning, Mr. Fredricksen! Need any help there? \nCARL No. Yes. Tell your boss over there that you boys are ruining our house. \nHe points across the lot to a business man in a suit talking on a cell phone - the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER. \nCONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM Well just to let you know, my boss would be happy to take this old place off your hands, and for double his last offer. Whaddya say to that? The leaf blower blasts off his hat. \nCONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM Uh, I take that as a no, then. \nCARL I believe I made my position to your boss quite clear. \nCONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM You poured prune juice in his gas tank. \nCARL Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let me talk to him. \nTom hands Carl his MEGAPHONE. \nCARL (in megaphone) You in the suit. Yes, you.      Take a bath, hippy! \nTom grabs the megaphone. \nCONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM (to Boss, re Carl) I am not with him! (to Carl) This is serious. He's out to get your house! \nCarl walks to his front door. \nCARL Tell your boss he can have our house. \nCONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM Really? \nCARL When I'm dead! Carl SLAMS the door. \nCONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM I'll take that as a maybe! \nINT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER \nCarl sits in his chair watching TV. \nA KNOCK at the door. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY \nThe door opens. A Wilderness Explorer stands, reading from a Wilderness Explorer Manual. He is in uniform, complete with sash, neckerchief, hat, and an enormous backpack stuffed with every piece of equipment there is. This is RUSSELL, age 8. Russell, nose buried in his MANUAL, reads to Carl. \nRUSSELL \"Good afternoon. My name is Russell. And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12. Are you in need of any assistance today, sir?\" \nAs he finishes the script, Russell smiles up at Carl. \nCARL No. \nRUSSELL I could help you cross the street. \nCARL No. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM WINDOW \nSails made from stitched-together curtains emerge from the windows and billow in the wind. Carl steers using ropes attached to the weather vane. \nINT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM \nThe compass needle rotates to point SOUTH. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE \nThe house turns. Carl looks out the window, satisfied.   He checks the balloons. \nINT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM \nCarl kisses a photo of Ellie. \nCARL We're on our way, Ellie. Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings tied to the grate. He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair.   He closes his eyes and smiles. SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING \nThe house drifts through the clouds. \nINT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM \nCarl relaxes in his chair. \nKNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. \nCARL Huh? \nHe stares at the front door.   Nothing. \nCARL Hm. \nKNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. \nHe bolts up and approaches the door. He looks out the peep hole. Nothing but the porch and clouds. He throws it open. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS \nNothing. He looks left.     Nothing.   He looks right.   Russell. He looks... Russell?!! \nRUSSELL Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.    It's me, Russell. \nCARL What are you doing out here, kid? \nRussell is plastered up against the wall, terrified and holding on for dear life. \nRUSSELL I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse. \nThe flag on Russell's backpack blows off and falls through the clouds. \nRUSSELL Please let me in? \nCARL No. \nCarl slams the door, leaving Russell alone. Beat. The door opens again. \nCARL Oh, alright, you can come... Russell runs into the house past Carl. \nCARL ...in. \nINT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nRussell PANTS, panicked.   He looks into living room. \nRUSSELL Huh. I've never been in a floating house before. \nCarl follows Russell into the living room.   Russell chuckles and points at the photo of young Ellie. \nRUSSELL Goggles.   Look at this stuff! Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of the open atlas. \nRUSSELL Wow, you going on a trip? (reads from the engraving) \"Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in Time.\" You going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen? Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket. \nCARL Don't touch that.   You'll soil it. \nRUSSELL You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your TV and clocks and stuff. Russell runs over to the steering rig. \nThe photo of Ellie rocks and slides off the wall.     Carl lunges to catch it. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING \nThe storm rages.    The house is tossed into the storm clouds. All goes black. \nINT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nCarl is asleep. A finger pokes Carl's face.     Nothing. \nThe finger pokes Carl's face again.    Carl WAKES UP. \nRUSSELL Whew!    I thought you were dead. \nCARL Wha... what happened? \nCarl STRUGGLES to rise from the pile of Ellie's things he'd been protecting. \nRUSSELL I steered us. I did!      I steered the house! \nCARL Steered us? \nRUSSELL After you tied your stuff down you took a nap, so I went ahead and steered us down here. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW \nCarl opens the window and looks out. \nCARL Huh? \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING \nThe house floats motionless above an ocean of clouds. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW \nCARL Can't tell where we are. \nINT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM \nRUSSELL Oh we're in South America all right. It was a cinch, with my Wilderness Explorer GPS. \nRussell holds up his WILDERNESS EXPLORER GPS UNIT. \nCARL GP-what? \nRUSSELL My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly where we are on the planet. With this baby, we'll never be lost! Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING \nCarl and Russell watch the tiny GPS unit descend into the clouds. \nRUSSELL Oops. \nINT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM \nCarl kneels by the fireplace and cuts at the balloon strings. \nCARL We'll get you down, find a bus stop. You just tell the man you want to go back to your mother. \nRUSSELL Sure, but I don't think they have busses in Paradise Falls. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING \nA small cluster of balloons fly up and away from the house. \nINT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM \nCARL There. That ought to do it. Here, I'll give you some change for bus fare. \nRussell follows Carl toward the front door. \nRUSSELL Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING \nThe house lowers into the fog. \nCARL Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up! Got it?! \nRussell continues to grunt and strain off screen. \nCARL You on the porch yet?! \nRussell is just inches above Carl, still STRUGGLING to climb. He slides down onto Carl's head, exhausted. \nCARL What? That's it?! I came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile? Aw, great! \nCarl paces. \nRUSSELL Hey, if I could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge? \nCARL What are you talking about? \nRUSSELL We could walk your house to the falls! \nCARL Walk it? \nRUSSELL Yeah, after all, we weigh it down. We could walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon. Carl considers this. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE, DAY - LATER \nThe house floats against the sky. The hose descends from the house and \"Y\"s to tie to both Carl and Russell. They wear the hose like a harness, pulling the house as they walk. \nCARL Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash-dancing. Russell inspects his surroundings. \nRUSSELL \n(DISTRACTED) Uh-huh. \nCARL We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we're not at the falls when that happens... \nRUSSELL Sand! \nCARL ...we're not getting to the falls! \nRUSSELL I found sand! \nCarl ROLLS HIS EYES.    He looks up at the house. \nCARL Don't you worry, Ellie.    We'll get our house over there. Russell looks up at the house.   Who's Carl talking to? \nRUSSELL Huh. (shrugs it off) This is fun already, isn't it? By the time we get there, you're gonna feel so assisted... Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the Wilderness Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!! \nThe WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL sets off Carl's hearing aid. \nRUSSELL Wait. Why are we going to Paradise Falls again? \nCARL Hey, let's play a game. It's called: \"See who can be quiet the longest.\" \nRUSSELL Cool!   My mom loves that game! \nThey head toward Paradise Falls, some 10 miles away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY \nMist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape. Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks. \nTwo dark shapes are chasing the prey.   Each has a light. Hunters. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN, GROVE OF TREES - CONTINUOUS \nThe prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another. A metal cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire. \nThe prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN, CLEARING - CONTINUOUS \nThe hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each wearing large, HIGH-TECH COLLARS. \nThey surround the prey.   Escape looks impossible. WOOSH! The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the three dogs and escaping in a flash. \nThe dogs head off in pursuit. A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears wincing in pain. They whimper and run off. \nRUSSELL Come on. Don't be afraid little snipe. Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice... A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell. \nRUSSELL ...giant snipe! \nEXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING \nCarl checks the knot on his hose harness.    Russell and the massive creature step up behind him. \nRUSSELL I found the snipe! \nCARL (humoring him) Oh, did you? \nRUSSELL Are they tall? \nCARL Oh yes, they're very tall. \nRUSSELL Do they have a lot of colors? \nCARL They do indeed. \nRUSSELL Do they like chocolate? \nCARL Oh ye-   Chocolate? \nCarl turns to look. Next to Russell stands a 13 foot tall, multicolored BIRD. \nCarl SCREAMS. \nCARL What is that thing?! \nRUSSELL It's a snipe! \nCARL There's no such thing as a snipe! \nRUSSELL But you said snipes eat-- \nCarl grabs Russell, pulling him away from the bird. \nThe bird HISSES at Carl and grabs Russell back.   It cradles Russell like a baby. \nRUSSELL Whoah! Russell GIGGLES. \nCarl pokes at the bird with his cane, trying to scare it off. \nCARL Go on, get out of here. Go on! Shoo! \nThe bird HISSES. It takes Russell up into a tree, swinging him around playfully. It looks scary and fun. \nRUSSELL \n(LAUGHING) Whoah! Whoah! \nCARL Careful, Russell! \nRUSSELL \n(LAUGHING) Hey, look Mr. Fredricksen, it likes me! \nCARL Russell! The bird grooms Russell. \nRUSSELL \n(LAUGHING) No stop, that tickles! \nCarl pokes the bird with his cane. \nCARL Get out of here.    Go on, git! \nThe bird sets Russell down.     It stalks Carl, HISSING and ruffling its feathers. \nCARL Aaaah! \nRUSSELL Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice! \nRussell pats Carl on the head. \nCARL \"Kevin\"? \nVOICE I can smell you. \nCarl stops. \nCARL What?    You can smell us? \nVOICE I can smell you. \nAs they get closer, they realize the man is in fact a ROCK. \nCARL Hey. \nRussell GIGGLES. \nRUSSELL You were talking to a rock. Russell points to another rock shape. \nRUSSELL Hey, that one looks like a turtle! \nSure enough. \nRUSSELL Look at that one!     That one looks like a dog! The \"rock\" walks forward. \nRUSSELL It is a dog! \nCARL What? \nRUSSELL Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment. The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it. \nRUSSELL Hey, I like dogs! \nCARL (calls out) We have your dog! (to self) Wonder who he belongs to? \nRUSSELL Sit boy. \nThe dog sits. \nRUSSELL Hey look, he's trained!    Shake! \nThe dog raises his paw and Russell shakes it. \nRUSSELL Uh-huh.    Speak. \nDUG Hi there. \nCarl and Russell freeze. \nCARL Did that dog just say \"Hi there?\" \nDUG Oh yes. Carl JUMPS back. \nDUG My name is Dug. I have just met you and I love you. \nDug jumps up on to Carl. \nCARL Uh..wha? \nDug wears a high-tech collar. The dog's thoughts come out of it as words through a speaker. It can talk. Unfortunately, it talks non-stop. \nDUG My master made me this collar. He is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that I may talk -- SQUIRREL!! Dug stares transfixed at a tree.    False alarm. \nDUG My master is good and smart. \nCARL It's not possible. \nDUG Oh it is, because my master is smart. \nRUSSELL Cool! What do these do, boy? \nHe inspects the collar and twists a dial. \nDUG Hey would you- \n(CLICK) -cuerdo con tigo- \n(CLICK) I use that collar- \n(CLICK) -watashi wa hanashi ma- \nDUG Hi Alpha.    Hey, your voice sounds funny. \nALPHA I know, I know!   Have you seen the bird? \nDUG Why yes, the bird is my prisoner now. \nGAMMA Yeah, right. \nThe screen view adjusts to see the bird.   It hisses. \nALPHA Impossible! Where are you?! \nDUG I am here with the bird and I will bring it back and then you will like me. Oh, gotta go. On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a boy's face. It's Russell. \nRUSSELL (on video screen) Hey Dug! Who you talking to? \nThe video screen goes blank.   The dogs BARK excitedly. \nBETA What's Dug doing? \nGAMMA Why's he with that small mailman? \nBETA Where are they? \nAlpha pushes a button on Beta's collar.    A TRACKING DEVICE locates Dug. \nALPHA There he is. Come on! \nThe dogs sprint off into the jungle. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE - DAY \nThe bird drags Dug, still clamped onto it's leg. \nDUG Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my prisoner! \nRUSSELL Dug, stop bothering Kevin! \nDUG That man there says I can take the bird and I love that man there like he is my master. \nThe bird HISSES. \nCARL I am not your master! \nThe bird tries to shake Dug off its leg.   Dug jumps up on it. \nDUG I am warning you, once again, bird! \nRUSSELL Hey!     Quit it! \nDUG I am jumping on you now, bird. \nRussell tries to separate them, which pulls on Carl's tether. \nCARL Russell! At this rate we'll never get to the falls! \nCarl pulls on the tether, knocking Russell over.   Carl falls, pulling the house into a tall rock. SMASH! Carl GASPS.   He turns his anger to the group. \nCARL I am nobody's master, got it? (points to bird) I don't want you here, (points to Dug) ...and I don't want you here. (points to Russell) I'm stuck with you. And if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three- Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane. \nDUG A ball!   Oh boy oh boy!     A ball! \nCARL Ball? Carl pops off one of the tennis balls. \nCARL You want it boy?     Huh?   Huh?   Yeah? \nDUG Oh oh oh! Yes, I do.        I do ever so want the ball! \nCARL Go get it!! Carl throws the ball far away.    Dug chases after it. \nDUG Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and then bring it back! \nCARL \n(WHISPERS) Quick Russell, give me some chocolate. \nRUSSELL Why? \nCARL Wait, aren't you \"Super Wilderness Guy?\" With the GPM's and the badges? \nRUSSELL Yeah, but... can I tell you a secret? \nCARL No. \nRUSSELL Alright, here goes. I never actually built a tent before. There. I said it. \nCARL You've been camping before, haven't you? \nRUSSELL Well, never outside. \nCARL Well, why didn't you ask your Dad how to build a tent? \nRUSSELL I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff. \nCARL Why don't you try him sometime? Maybe he'll surprise you. \nRUSSELL Well, he's away a lot.   I don't see him much. \nCARL He's got to be home sometime. \nRUSSELL Well, I called, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much. \nCARL Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name? \nRUSSELL Phyllis isn't my mom. Carl realizes he put his foot in it. \nCARL Oh. \nThe two sit silently together, watching the fire. \nRUSSELL But he promised he'd come to my Explorer ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge, so he can show me about tents then, right? \nCarl studies Russell's sad optimism.   He looks at the missing badge on Russell's sash. \nCARL Hey, uh, why don't you get some sleep. Don't want to wake up the traveling flea circus. \nDug nuzzles around the sleeping bird's leg. \nRUSSELL Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner. We have to protect him! \nRussell YAWNS and lies down on the rock next to Carl. \nRUSSELL Can Kevin go with us? \nCARL Alright.   He can come. \nRUSSELL Promise you won't leave him? \nCARL Yeah. \nRUSSELL Cross your heart? \nCarl looks down at Russell. \nCARL Cross my heart. \nCarl sits at the campfire, the others asleep.    He shakes his head and looks up at the house. \nCARL What have I got myself into, Ellie? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - MORNING \nA frog sits next to Carl's glasses. It CROAKS. Carl's hand smacks it like an alarm clock. The frog hops away. \nCarl rises, looking up at the house. \nCARL Morning Sweetheart. \nThe balloons on the house are wilting. \nCARL We better get moving. \nHe scans the camp.   The bird is gone. \nAlpha BARKS angrily. \nALPHA You lost it. Why do I not have a surprised feeling? Well, at least you now have lead us to the small mailman and The One Who Smells of Prunes. \nCarl and Russell look at Dug.    He turned on them!   Dug shamefully lowers his head. \nALPHA Master will be most pleased we have found them, and will ask of them many questions. (commanding, to Carl) Come! \nCARL Wait, we're not going with you. We're going to the falls! Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl. \nCARL Get away from me! Get down! \nThe dogs lead Carl and Russell like prisoners.    Dug follows. The house is pulled after them, and on the roof: THE BIRD. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN, DESOLATE ROCKY AREA - DAY \nAlpha leads Carl and Russell through a canyon. \nDogs patrol the tops of the canyon walls. Four more large dogs join the group.    Carl and Russell watch warily and continue their march. \nThey round a bend.     Before them is a MASSIVE CAVE OPENING. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN, CAVE ENTRANCE \nThe house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group approaches the huge cave opening. \nDOZENS OF DOGS step out of the cave. Carl and Russell stop. More dogs approach from the side. Every way Carl turns there are more dogs! \nGrowling and snarling, the dogs surround Carl and Russell. Closer... closer... \nFrom the darkness a voice: \nVOICE (O.S.) Stay! \nThe dogs stop. A figure peers out from the darkness.      It examines Carl, Russell, and the floating house. \nVOICE You came here in that? \nCARL Uh... yeah. \nVOICE In a house? A floating house? The man laughs.   Carl and Russell laugh along nervously. \nVOICE That is the darndest thing I've ever seen! You're not after my bird, are you? But if you need to borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige! The dogs LAUGH uproariously at the man's joke. \nVOICE Well, this is all a misunderstanding. My dogs made a mistake. \nThe figure walks out toward Carl into the light.   Carl recognizes him! \nCARL Wait, are you Charles Muntz?! \nMUNTZ Well... Yes. \nCARL The Charles Muntz? \nMuntz gives him the \"thumbs up.\" \nMUNTZ \"Adventure is out there!\" \nCarl GIGGLES with glee. \nCARL It's really him! (to Russell) That's Charles Muntz! \nRUSSELL \n(EXCITED) It is?!? \n(CONSIDERS) Who's Charles Muntz? \nCARL Him! \nDOG WALLA Yes!    It is him! He is! \nCARL I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I, we were your biggest fans! \nCarl rushes to shake Muntz's hand.    Muntz is charmed. \nMUNTZ Well, you're a man of good taste! \nMUNTZ Hm, excellent choice. (to Carl) I found it on safari with Roosevelt. Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle. POP! They sloppily pour two glasses. \nMUNTZ He and I fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings. And did he cheat? Oh, he was horrible! \nMuntz and Carl LAUGH.   Alpha interrupts. \nALPHA (high-pitched voice) Master, dinner is ready. \nMUNTZ Oh dear, broken translator.   It's that loose wire again. (leans down, fixes it) There you go big fella. \nALPHA (deep scary voice) Thank you Master. Russell reacts. \nRUSSELL I liked his other voice. Muntz LAUGHS. \nMUNTZ Well, dinner is served!    Right this way. \nINT. DIRIGIBLE, DINING ROOM \nMuntz leads Carl and Russell into the dining room and up to a large table. \nMUNTZ So how are things stateside? Almost tempted to go back a few times, but I have unfinished work here... Please. Dogs pull back chairs for them.   They sit.   Dog waiters place napkins on their laps. \nMUNTZ I hope you're hungry because Epsilon is the finest chef I've ever had. Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove the silver plate covers at the same time. The meals look delicious. \nMUNTZ Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again! \nRUSSELL Yes!! Russell is served a hot dog.   His waiter can't resist and eats a bite. \nRUSSELL Hey! \nAnother dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his glass. \nRUSSELL Hey! \nCarl looks around, still enthralled. \nCARL Oh my Ellie would have loved all this. You know, it's because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by Paradise Falls. \nHe gestures toward HIS HOUSE, tethered outside the porthole window. \nMUNTZ I'm honored. And now you've made it! \nCARL You're sure we're not a bother? I'd hate to impose. \nMUNTZ No no! It's a pleasure to have guests -- a real treat. \nThe dogs erupt into excited barking. \nDOG WALLA Treat?!   Treat! I want a treat! \nMUNTZ No no, quiet! Calm down.     Calm down... In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell's hot dog. \nRUSSELL Hey! \nMUNTZ \n(CONT'D) Shouldn't've used that word... Having guests is a delight. More often I get thieves, come to steal what's rightfully mine. \nCARL No! \nMuntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room. \nMUNTZ They called me a fraud, those... dah! But once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared. The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples, feathers. Hundreds of them... all of THE BIRD. Kevin. \nThis is Muntz's obsession. He looks over to a full size skeleton. \nMUNTZ Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a lifetime tracking it. Sometimes years go by between sightings... \n(MORE) \nMUNTZ (cont'd) I've tried to smoke it out of that deathly labyrinth where it lives... Can't go in after it. Once in, there's no way out. Lost so many dogs... Muntz is lost in reverie. \nMUNTZ And here they come, these bandits, and think the bird is theirs to take! But they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place. \nDistracted Russell finally notices the skeleton. \nRUSSELL Hey, that looks like Kevin! \nRUSSELL They're coming! \nCarl and Russell run toward the cave opening. Dogs block the cave opening.        Carl stops short. \nDUG (O.S.) Master, over here! \nDug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave.     Carl and Russell run toward him. \nThe cave leads to a steep incline.      The dogs are getting closer. There's no choice but to JUMP. \nThe lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell to leap down the incline, like astronauts. \nDUG Go toward the light, master! Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell. \nThe bird sees the dogs. She jumps off the house and lifts Carl and Russell on her back. She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her. Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life. \nBANG BANG BANG! Balloons pop as they scrape across the ceiling. The house lowers. \nAhead, a giant rock sits in their path. Carl tugs at the house but it CRASHES against the rock, pulling Russell onto the ground. \nCARL Russell! \nDragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN, CANYON - CONTINUOUS \nThe dogs close in on Russell. Alpha bites at his heels. Carl fends off Alpha with his cane. \nCARL Get back!! Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains down! The dogs stop short. \nCarl looks back as the bird keeps running.      Dug is up on the canyon wall. He caused the avalanche! \nDUG Go on Master!       I will stop the dogs! Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs. \nDUG Stop you dogs!! \nThe dogs run around Dug. \nAlpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path. \nThe bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind.    She rounds a corner. Russell SWINGS OUT over the abyss. \nThe bird jumps from rock spire to spire.   Russell swings back and forth wildly in the air. \nRUSSELL Help! Help! \nRussell does the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL. \nCARL Gimme your hand! Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl PULLS him back onto the bird. Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE.   A river winds 100 feet below. \nCarl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward. \nRUSSELL Hang on to Kevin! \nCarl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar. \nJust as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries them across the chasm. Alpha bites the bird on the leg but is kicked loose and falls into the river below. \nCarl LANDS HARD but safely across the river chasm.     The dogs are stuck on the other side. Carl painfully gets up.    He looks up at his house.   It's still intact. \nHe breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF. \nRUSSELL (O.S.) Kevin! \nThe bird tries to stand but SQUAWKS pitifully and falls back to the ground. Russell rushes to her side. \nThe bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite.   She can't stand. \nRussell applies a bandage. \nFrom the distant labyrinth of rocks, the BIRD BABIES call. Kevin CALLS back to them. She tries to stand, but can't. \nRussell runs to her side. \nRUSSELL No no no! Kevin! Stay down. (to Carl) She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home? \nCarl looks at the bird's wounds.   He looks to the rock maze, then to his house. He knows the right thing to do.    And he hates himself for it. \nRUSSELL Run Kevin! Run! \nA net shoots out and binds her. She falls and CALLS OUT. \nRUSSELL Oh no! \nThe net catches on a rock. Carl and Russell run to her aid. \nCARL Russell, give me your knife! \nCarl saws frantically at the net. \nMUNTZ (O.S.) Get away from my bird! \nMuntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible.     Beside them, a group of dogs drag forward CARL'S HOUSE. \nMuntz hurls a lit lantern.      Flames burst up beneath the house. \nHeat waves ripple up.   Balloons POP.    Carl's house LOWERS into the fire. \nINT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nInside the living room, Ellie's photo crashes to the floor. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - CONTINUOUS \nCARL No! \nCarl panics.    He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife. \nMuntz motions to the dogs. They swarm past Russell, knocking him down and grabbing the bird in the net. \nRUSSELL No! Carl pulls his house away from the flames. \nThe bird CALLS OUT plaintively as the dogs drag her into the dirigible. \nMuntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible. \nMUNTZ Careful. We want her in good shape for my return. \nRUSSELL Let her go! Stop! \nRussell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes. The dirigible flies off. \nRUSSELL Kevin! Carl beats out the flames with his jacket.     He extinguishes the flames. \nCarl collapses on the side of his house. \nRUSSELL You gave away Kevin.   You just gave her away. \nCARL This is none of my concern.      I didn't ask for any of this! \nDUG Master.   It's alright. \nCARL I am not your master! And if you hadn't a shown up, none of this would have happened! Bad dog! Bad dog! \nDug slinks off, tail between his legs. Carl angrily puts on the harness. \nCARL Now, whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me. \nHe walks off.   Russell falls in behind. An angry dawn breaks. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY \nNow barely aloft, Carl pulls the house across the rocky landscape. \nRussell's harness drags along side, empty. \nRussell walks behind. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE - MORNING \nWith the last of his energy, Carl drags the house into place. The house groans as it comes to rest. \nCarl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff. \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS - MORNING \nDUG Uh... POINT! Dug points to a grate in the wall. \nINT. DIRIGIBLE, GAS CELL AREA \nDug leads Carl \"backstage\" through a vent shaft into the dirigible. They sneak past two biplanes. \nINT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM \nThey emerge through a grate near the ceiling. They look down into the room where the bird is kept in a cage. \nCARL Kevin! \nThe bird recognizes Carl and CRIES OUT. \nCARL Don't worry Kevin, we're on our way! Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs. Carl and Dug duck into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above. \nALPHA Allow no one to be entering through these doors. Guard well that bird, my minions. \nCARL \n(WHISPERS) What do we do now, Dug? \nDug is lost in ecstacy, chomping on a tennis ball on the end of Carl's cane. \nINT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nCarl drops down from the ceiling and stands on the cage.      He bangs his cane. All the dogs turn. He grabs a ball from his cane and waves it in the air. \nCARL Who wants the ball? \nDOGS Me! I do! I want the ball! \nCARL Then go get it! Carl throws the ball.    The dogs scramble after it. \nINT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe dogs pile into the hallway in pursuit. \nDOGS I'm gonna get there first! Oh gonna get the ball! I'm gonna get it! \nGamma catches it.. \nGAMMA I got it!! \nBehind them Carl shuts the door.    The dogs realize their mistake. \nGAMMA Uh-oh. \nINT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM \nCarl opens the cage door. \nCARL I'm sorry Kevin.      Let's get you out of here. \nINT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT \nMuntz scans the horizon.    Suddenly the in-ship communicator comes to life. \nDOG WALLA (on radio) Master! He's gone! The old man! He's here! He's got the bird! The bird's gone! \nMUNTZ What?    Calm down!   One at a time! \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT PORCH \nRussell STRUGGLES to break free of the chair. \nRUSSELL I want to help! He manages to get his arms free. \nRUSSELL Ha ha! \nExcept that all his struggling causes the chair to hop out on the porch and fall off. \nRussell SCREAMS as he falls.     The hose unspools. \nRussell reaches the end of the hose. Russell grabs onto it and the chair jostles free, falling thousands of feet down. \nThe house drifts away from the dirigible. \nMUNTZ Enough! I'm taking that bird back with me alive or dead! Carl trips and falls to the floor.     Muntz is about to deal the final blow. \nINT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT \nMeanwhile Alpha backs Dug into the control panel.        He bumps a a LEVER. \nEXT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS \nThe entire dirigible rocks wildly to the side. \nINT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM \nMuntz is knocked off balance.     He slides to one side.    Trophy cases slide after him. The dirigible tilts to the other side. \nThe broken trophy cases barrel straight toward Carl! Carl is thrown into a window which bursts open. Carl falls through but manages to grab the frame with his cane. He dangles out over open air. He sees the biplanes circling the house, Russell hanging beneath it. \nThe ship corrects again.      Carl climbs back inside. Muntz comes at Carl. \nCARL Come on, Kevin! \nEXT. SIDE OF DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS \nCarl climbs the work ladder up the side of the dirigible.    He pushes the bird along as he goes. \nMuntz follows up. \nINT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT \nAlpha throws Dug viciously across the room. Alpha throws him again and Dug crashes into the steering wheel, knocking a radar shade off the control panel. Alpha moves in.     Dug hides behind the steering wheel. \nALPHA I will have many enjoyments for what I am about to do, Dug. \nAlpha lunges at Dug through the steering wheel.    Dug cowers, but then notices the RADAR SHADE. \nAs Alpha lunges again, Dug jams the shade over Alpha's head. Alpha's head is stuck, trapped by the cone. The dogs all GASP. \nMISC DOG He wears the Cone of Shame! \nALPHA (high-pitched voice) What? Do not just continue sitting! Attack! \nThe bump caused his collar to go funny again.    The dogs all howl with laughter. \nALPHA (high pitched voice) No! No! Stop your laughing! Get this off of me! \nDUG Listen you dog!     Sit! Surprised at Dug's moxy, Alpha sits.    All other dogs sit too. \nDOG WALLA Yes, Alpha. \nDUG Alpha? I am not Alpha, he is- \n(REALIZING) Oohhhh! \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE \nRussell TRIES TO CLIMB the hose.   His hands are about to give out. The biplanes head straight at Russell. \nRUSSELL (out of breath) I can't do it! \nBehind him, Carl is climbing the side of the dirigible for dear life, Muntz closing in. \nCARL (far in the distance) Russell! \nRUSSELL Huh? \nCarl calls for help: the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL. \nRUSSELL You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone! \nRussell CLIMBS! He's more machine than boy now. Biplanes shooting the whole way, he climbs up onto the porch. The biplanes close in. \nRussell yells to them. \nRUSSELL Hey! (pointing down) Squirrel! \nAll the dog pilots snap to attention. \nGAMMA Squirrel? \n", "test1_input": "RUSSELL Two blocks down! Got it! \nRussell runs down the block clapping and calling. \nRUSSELL Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey... \nCARL (calls after Russell) Bring it back here when you find it! Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door. \nHe stops short. \nA large truck is backing up, getting dangerously close to \nELLIE'S MAILBOX. \nCONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE Okay, keep her coming... And... stop. Stop! STOP!! The truck hits Ellie's mailbox, crushing the front. \nCarl is shocked.   He runs to the box. \nCARL What? Hey! Hey you!         What do you think you're doing? \nCONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE I am so sorry, sir... \nThe worker bangs on the mailbox, trying to fix it. \nCARL Don't touch that! \nCONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE No no, let me take care of that for you. \nCarl grabs the mailbox, trying to wrestle it from the worker. \nCARL \n(STRUGGLING) Get away from our mailbox! \nCONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE Hey sir, I... \nCARL I don't want you to touch it! Carl HITS the worker with his cane.      He falls to the sidewalk. The worker rubs his head.    Blood. \nCarl backs up toward his door, cradling his mailbox.     What has he done? \nPasserbys stare. Workers gather, as does the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER. \nCarl backs into his house. \nINT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM \nCarl shuts his door.   He closes the curtains. He peeks out the window. The injured worker is helped to his feet. A police car pulls up. \nThe Real Estate Developer looks toward Carl's house.     His hand rests on Carl's fence. \nINT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY \nCarl sits alone on a bench holding a Court Summons. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nA GUARD opens the door. Carl enters.    The REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER watches him enter. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE - LATE EVENING \nA Police Officer drops Carl at his front gate. \nOFFICER EDITH Sorry Mr. Fredricksen. You don't seem like a public menace to me. Take this. \nShe hands him a pamphlet for SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE. \nOFFICER EDITH The guys from Shady Oaks will be by to pick you up in the morning, okay? The officer drives off, leaving Carl alone. \nCarl faces the house.    He touches Ellie's dented mailbox. \nCARL What do I do now, Ellie? \nINT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT \nAll is quiet but the slow ticking of the clock. The empty hall. \nThe front hall mirror. The kitchen. \n", "test1_true": "Carl pulls out a suitcase.   A book tips over.   Ellie's Adventure Book. \nINT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM \nCarl sits in his chair slowly paging through the book. \nHe turns to the page marked \"STUFF I'M GOING TO DO.\"    He closes the book and sighs. \nCarl looks at the Adventure Shrine, and the PAINTING of their house by Paradise Falls. He holds the Shady Oaks pamphlet. \nCarl's brows furrow.    He looks up at the shrine, and crosses his heart. \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nLights are on inside the house. \nMATCH DISSOLVE \nTO: \nEXT. CARL'S HOUSE - MORNING \nA SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE van pulls up.

You ready to go? \nCARL Ready as I'll ever be. Would you do me a favor and take this? \nCarl hands over his suitcase. \nCARL I'll meet you at the van in just a minute. I... want to say one last goodbye to the old place. \nNURSE GEORGE Sure.   Take all the time you need, sir. \nCarl closes the door.   Rather sharply.   The nurses head back to the van. \nNURSE A.J. Typical. He's probably going to the bathroom for the eightieth time. \nEmpty helium tanks are strewn on the front lawn. \nNURSE GEORGE You'd think he'd take better care of his house. \nA SHADOW falls over the nurses.   They turn to look. \nA giant tarp rises behind Carl's house.     It unfolds to reveal \nTHOUSANDS OF BALLOONS. \nThe balloons rise up like some massive multi-colored cumulus cloud forming a thunderhead above the house. Strings tug at the chimney. The house strains.     Pipes bend, then break. Electrical wires spark and snap. The house rips away from its foundation. \nThe nurses duck and YELL as the house soars over them.    Carl looks out the window and LAUGHS. \nCARL So long boys! I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls! \nINT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nBalloons spill colored light into a little girl's room as the house floats past. \nEXT. TOWN \nThe shadow of the house drifts through an intersection. \nEXT. SHOP WINDOW \nA family watches the house float down the street. \nEXT. ABOVE THE TOWN \nCarl waves at a high-rise window washer, who tentatively waves back.

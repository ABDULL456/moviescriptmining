Fog.  The sound of water.  Lapping at the hull of a boat.  The mist drfits, revealing... 
Eyes.  They are blue.  The heavy brows above them dark gold, matted and damp. 
CARL (O.S.) My batteries are drawed down, both of 'em.  ALternator belts were loose. 
PULL BACK to see him.  With his keroses lantern and his air horn. 
KABUO (O.S.) No sweat.  We'll pull one a mine, get ya started. 
PULL BACK to see him now, leaning on his gaff.  Squinting up.  At the top of Carl's mast.  We follow his gaze to see... 
KABUO (O.S.) You lashed up a lantern?  'Gainst a fog like this? 
See it now.  SWAYING as the helpless boat bobs in the night. 
CARL (O.S.) Lantern and a air horn.  That's all I got, without my juice. 
INT. CARL'S CABIN - LATER 
CLOSE on a battery well.  One battery sits in place, one spot is empty.  And... 
...CRASH!  The butt end of a fishing gaff BANGS against the metal flange.  Again.  Again.  AGAIN.  And as the next blow is STRUCK, the huge hand... 
...slips, and the soft metal SLICES Carl's flesh across his palm. He stops.  Then SMASHES away, twice more.  We PULL BACK to see... 
...two batteries lie above the well.  Carl sucks the blood from his cut.  Then lifts Kabuo's D-6 into place... 
CARL Don't know how long it's take to get a charge... 
KABUO Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks... 
Kabuo takes his gaff.  Heedless of Carl's blood on the butt end. Carl looks up, still crouching above his well. 
CARL (quietly) Hold on.  You know as well as I do, we got somethin' to talk about. 
No response from Kabuo.  He stands above the larger man.  Silent, neutral.  Waiting. 
CARL Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all. 
KABUO What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there. 
Which makes the big man smile.  Just a little. 
CARL Did I say I was selling?  But if I was, I'd have to figure you want 'em real bad.  Oughta charge a sall fortune, maybe... 
A slight shrug.  Of giant shoulders. 
CARL Then again.  Maybe you'd want your battery back. 
Kabuo doesn't grin back.  His face shows nothing at all. 
KABUO The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m... 
CARL ...might do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be. 
Kabuo's face remains impassive.  Patient.  And the big man squints up into it.  Holding a handkerchief to his injured hand. 
CARL Hell, I'm sorry, okay?  About the whole damn mess.  If I'd a been around, my mother wouldn't a pulled it off that way. 
He is sorry.  And with that, Kabuo's face eases.  Becomes like Carl's own. 
CARL (grins) I was out there at sea.  Fightin' you Jap sons-a-bitches. 
KABUO (no grin) I'm an American.  Did I call you a Nazi, you big Nazi bastard? 
CARL (softly) Not that I recall. 
KABUO I killed men who looked just like you, pig-fed German bastards.  And their blood don't wash off so easy. 
Still no smile.  Carl staring up. 
KABUO So don't talk to me about Japs, you big Nazi son of a bitch. 
Carl laughs.  And Kabuo chuckles, right along with him.  Having kept his poker face the longer. 
CARL I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod. 
KABUO Oh, yeh? 
CARL Hid it from my mom.  Caught a mess a sea runs.  Damn thing's still in my closet. 
KABUO (very softly) You can have it.  The hell with it. 
The look between them now.  Is very wonderful.  In the subtlety of its connection. 
CARL $1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that. 
KABUO Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all. 
The handkerchief comes away from Carl's palm.  And rising, his hand extends toward the smaller man. 
CARL A thousand down.  We'll sign papers t'morrow. 
The hands grip.  And they hold.  And the length of this clasp, and the straightness of their gaze, and the silence of the moment. Wash years away. 
KABUO Eight hundred.  And it's a deal. 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
CLOSE on eyes.  They are Asian.  Unblinking. 
HOOKS (O.S.) For the life of me, sir, I cannot imagine why you kept this story from the sheriff. 
PULL BACK to see Kabuo in the witness box.  Ramrod straight.  Face composed. 
KABUO As my wife testified, we were considering it. 
HOOKS Actually, she said you had decided. Decided not not come forward. 
KABUO (quietly) I was thinking about it.  Every minute.

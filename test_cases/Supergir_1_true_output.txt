ZALTAR You can use the wand. 
SUPERGIRL Better than when I was a child. 
She hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress. 
ZALTAR I remember you then. Cute thing you were. Like your mother. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM 
Selena stands watching the image of Zaltar and Supergirl in her mirror. Beside her on the floor is the Coffer of Shadow, now swollen to the size of a large pumpkin. It pulses and glows with inner light. The lid of the Coffer of Shadow starts to rattle as if something inside is attempting to get out. 
INT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX 
Flaming spheres of BALL LIGHTNING begin to whizz past Zaltar and Supergirl. Zaltar is startled, and he stops his forward progress. 
ZALTAR What's that? Never saw anything like that. 
SUPERGIRL Don't stop. Keep moving. 
ZALTAR Yes, mustn't stop. 
SUPERGIRL (grimly) It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work. 
Another flaming sphere whizzes toward them. It hits Zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path. He starts to roll backwards down the vortex. 
SUPERGIRL Zaltar. Use the wand! 
ZALTAR Too late. Too late. Save yourself. 
He is being swept faster and .faster away from her, receding like the image of Ethan when she was trapped in the zone. Zaltar throws the wand to her, and then is swept away, out of sight, downward to his death. He calls out after he disappears. 
ZALTAR (voice over) Goodbye... 
SUPERGIRL Zaltar! 
She begins to be swept backwards, but she uses the wand, and stops her slide. Gripping the wand fiercely, she starts to forge ahead. All the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that Selena sends down the vortex. 
SUPERGIRL You're not going to win, Selena. I won't let you. 
Suddenly Supergirl enters another area of the vortex. She begins to move forward, upward, without clawing her way. She accelerates, moving faster and faster. 
EXT. GRASSY MEADOW BESIDE A POND 
Supergirl lands, in a deserted sunny meadow. She collapses sobbing on the grass. The matterwand lies beside her. 
SUPERGIRL Zaltar, Zaltar. You never had a selfish heart. 
She looks up at the sun shining down serenely, bathing the Earth in its life-giving rays---and returning her superpowers to her. 
SUPERGIRL Wherever you are, Zaltar, thank 'you. 
She stands up and flexes her muscles. She no longer looks tired or disheveled. Her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight. She picks up the matterwand and leaps into the air, flying faster than a speeding bullet. 
EXT. ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN 
Supergirl swoops down from the sky and dives through the roof. 
INT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM 
Supergirl smashes through the ceiling and lands next to the French doors. Ethan and Selena are standing against the opposite wall, next to the veiled mirror. 
SUPERGIRL You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over. 
ETHAN She has hostages. 
SELENA The Danvers. And two of your little friends. 
SUPERGIRL It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for. 
Ethan points to the conservatory and mimes the words 'out there'. Selena blows on the silver whistle on the chain around her neck. 
INSERT: THE SERPENT HOLDING JIMMY OLSEN'S CAGE OPENS ITS MOUTH AND THE CAGE DROPS AWAY.

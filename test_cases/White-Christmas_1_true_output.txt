BETTY I'm not the least bit worried. (Phil and Judy enter from the kitchen) Frankly, this couldn't come at a better time.  They want me to come back to The Carousel again - I used to sing there before Judy and I teamed up - and I had to turn it down because they can only use a single. (Not too well) So - this couldn't be more convenient. You stay with the show and I'll go back to The Carousel. 
JUDY When did you get this offer? 
BETTY Just today, as a matter of fact.  I got a telegram. 
JUDY Why didn't you mention it before? 
BETTY I didn't want to hurt your feelings. 
JUDY Where is the telegram? 
BETTY I threw it away.  What is this, a third degree?  You don't think I made it up? 
JUDY Yes, I do. 
There is a pause, and Waverly, who has been watching each one, speaks. 
WAVERLY Well now, I wouldn't bet any large sum of money on that, since I took the message over the telephone, and I had to deliver the telegram. (To take the tension off) And she didn't tip me, either. 
Betty looks at him gratefully. 
JUDY Oh, Betty! (She throws her arms around her) I'm sorry!  I misunderstood! 
BETTY Now, baby!  It's all right! 
PHIL Well, everything's fine now! 
Happy, he beams at Judy. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND WAVERLY 
Something bothers Bob about this story.  He looks searchingly at Betty, puzzled.  He does not notice Waverly, who watches him watching Betty. 
SLOW DISSOLVE TO: 
LONG SHOT - RAILROAD STATION - DAY 
Train about to leave.  The General is in the foreground sitting in the buggy.  Betty is saying goodbye to him. 
Bob and the porter are taking care of her luggage. 
GENERAL (Shouting over noise of train) Where are you going to be? 
BETTY The Carousel. 
The General looks at her, questioningly. 
BETTY (Whispering, during a lull in the noise) I sent them a telegram this morning. 
The General smiles; Betty waves a farewell to him and crosses to the train, starting up the steps.  The notion behind this scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue due to the whistle, bells, and escaping steam.  The manner of playing, though, indicates the sentiment.  To emphasize it: Bob is fonder of Betty than he realizes, and Betty fully realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not return, consciously, her affection.  We hear Betty: 
BETTY Take care of my little sister. 
BOB She can take care of herself.  Worry about the menfolk.  Now don't forget to write. 
BETTY I'll send you picture postcards. 
Not all of this is heard, since the sound effects pick their spots, but the attention is on the General, who is watching the scene with a whimsical look.  He, as does the audience, realizes Bob's true feelings.  As the train starts to leave, Betty and Bob shake hands.  She holds his handshake a little longer than necessary, and Bob is forced to move along with the train.  Finally she releases him, and Bob looks after the train, puzzled.

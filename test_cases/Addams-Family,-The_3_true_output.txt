Do you want a cigar, Father? 
GOMEZ 
(in a monotone) They're very bad for you. 
WEDNESDAY 
(very worried) Father? Wednesday exchanges a panic-stricken look with Morticia. The family moves closer to Gomez. 
GOMEZ 
But maybe I'll have one of those... He takes a bar of soap from Pugsley.     Gomez unwraps it and morosely eats.

THE COAL CHUTE ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE -- 
drops open, dumping out Fester, Abigail, and Tully - all of them wet and bedraggled and gasping for air. 
ABIGAIL 
(to Fester) You're doing this on purpose.

Gomez is STRETCHED OUT on the naked box springs of his bed -- the mattress pushed aside. A damp cloth covers his eyes. Thing MASSAGES his aching head. A bowl of MOTEL SOAPS is beside him. In contrast, Morticia squarely faces the crisis. She addresses the family from the head of the breakfast table, the want ads open on the table before her.

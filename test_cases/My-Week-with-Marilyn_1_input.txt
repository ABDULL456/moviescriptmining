COLIN Paula was with us the whole time. 
WATTIS The mind boggles, dear. COLIN smiles but his expression freezes as he looks up to see LUCY nearby. She has heard every word of the exchange.

90 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 90 
MARILYN is finally back on the set, filming a solo dance routine. Released from the need to remember any words she takes refuge in the physical activity, undulating sexily in her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky, mildly silly and charming all at the same time. The dance is deliberately a little amateurish. Elsie Marina isn't meant to be any sort of superstar. But she radiates joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and MARILYN captures all this perfectly. Within the scene the actor JEREMY SPENSER, playing Nicky, watches from the doorway. Everyone watches silently from behind the camera. No one can look away, least of all COLIN. It feels like one purely joyful moment in the agony the film has become, and Marilyn is radiant. Even OLIVIER has a reluctant half-smile on his face as he watches.

The stage is empty except for OLIVIER and MILLER. They sit in a pool of light in the cavernous room. COLIN pours whisky for them and then steps back into the shadows. Both men ignore him. He is too unimportant to worry about. MILLER leans forward, holding his pipe but not smoking it. 
MILLER I dreamed last night I could hear singing. And then I realised it wasn't a dream. There was a male voice choir serenading Marilyn under our window. At two in the morning. It's a circus. A freak show. OLIVIER smiles but MILLER looks dazed. 
MILLER (CONT'D) I'm going back to New York for a few days. I need to see my kids. I need a break. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 65. 
OLIVIER That won't help Marilyn. 
MILLER (After a moment) I can't help her. (Pause) You know what she loves to do most? Sleep. It's what she lives for. Sleep is her demon. He pauses for a second. 
MILLER (CONT'D) I've disappointed her. OLIVIER looks at him. MILLER shakes his head. 
MILLER (CONT'D) She thought I could smash all her insecurities with one magical stroke. That I could make her a new person. He pauses for a second, weighing every word carefully. 
MILLER (CONT'D) She wants me to protect her but I can't. I can't even protect myself. (Pause) She read some notes I made. They were nothing. Just a few ideas. 
OLIVIER About her? He looks up and nods slowly. 
MILLER She took them the wrong way. He leaves a long, uneasy pause. 
OLIVIER But you do love her? Your new bride and all that? MILLER plays with his whisky. 
MILLER I can't work. I can't think. (Pause) She's devouring me. Forgotten in the shadows, COLIN listens attentively to every word.

92 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE. DAY. 92 
Early morning. COLIN sees Olivier's black Bentley cruising towards the gate. VIVIEN LEIGH sits in the back seat. 
VIVIEN Hello, Colin darling. You look like Horatio defending the bridge. Are you going to let me in? 
CUT TO: 
93 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 93 
VIVIEN is doing what amounts to a royal tour. She greets everyone, from the lowest chippie to the Heads of Department with the same flirtatious grace. OLIVIER walks at her elbow. The crew crowd around her. She is easy and relaxed, relishing every second of their attention. 
VIVIEN I hope Larry isn't making you all work too hard. I know what a dreadful slave driver he can be. She sees ORTON and takes his hands. 
VIVIEN (CONT'D) David, he would be lost without you. 
ORTON Just doing my job. Tough as he is, he melts visibly. She moves on to JACK CARDIFF, the lighting cameraman, looking at him in mock misery. 
VIVIEN I'm getting old, Jack. I need you to work your miracles on me. 
CARDIFF You're more beautiful every year, Vivien. She laughs and turns to COLIN, looking at him severely. 
VIVIEN Now, you are looking after Larry like I told you? 
COLIN I'm doing my best... VIVIEN glances away to see MARILYN standing nearby, awkward and excluded. She has come straight from make-up and wears only a towelling robe, slippers and curlers in her hair. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 67. 
Compared to VIVIEN she looks frumpish. VIVIEN glides towards her, hands extended. 
VIVIEN Darling Marilyn! She kisses her on both cheeks and holds her hands. 
VIVIEN (CONT'D) Larry tells me you are quite, quite superb. I'm wild with jealousy. 
MARILYN Oh, but everyone says you were a wonderful Elsie on stage. 
VIVIEN But I'm too old to play her in the film. Larry was quite brutal about that. You see, the truth is all that matters to him. That's why we all admire him so very much. She glances at OLIVIER with a fluttering laugh. He smiles back with a haunted look in his eyes. 
VIVIEN (CONT'D) Now, I must let you work. I only came to wish you good luck! Goodbye, everyone! The crew press around her. MARILYN watches, feeling more than ever the odd one out. COLIN watches her from the edge of the crowd. She cuts a lonely, vulnerable figure. He is totally preoccupied with her, so much so that when VIVIEN comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out. VIVIEN stares at him. All her exuberance has vanished and she looks suddenly tired and older. It as though the facade of a beautiful building is beginning to crack. She gazes at him with bitter disappointment. 
VIVIEN (CONT'D) Oh, Colin. Not you too. He wants to protest but VIVIEN is already turning away.

INT. NORMAN'S OFFICE 
Carl nervously sits before Norman. 
NORMAN Earlier today, you showed some initiative. And I loved it. What do you say to a permanent spot at the loan desk? 
CARL That seems like a lot of responsibility. 
NORMAN We need a loan specialist a lot more than we need a teller and greeter. Besides, you'd have a starting salary of 52. 
CARL Grand? 
NORMAN No, dollars. What is this Darfur? (waving to an African- American employee) Sorry, Patricia, that was inappropriate. (then, back to Carl) Of course grand. To celebrate, next Saturday, I'm throwing a party. Dress up as your favorite character from Heroes. (WHISPERING) Save the cheerleader, save the world. 
CARL Next Saturday... sounds great. 
NORMAN Don't dress as Hiro.    I got dibs. 
CARL Wouldn't think of it. 
Carl heads back to the loan desk, happy about his promotion. 
INT. RUDY'S 
Carl walks in the door. Peter, Lucy and Rooney, who's clearly been there for a little while, comes up to him. 
ROONEY Carl Kendall? Out in the world? Are you some kind of ghost? Am I having a religious vision? 
CARL Believe it. Because this guy just got a promotion. 
LUCY Congrats, Carl! 
ROONEY Well let's get you a beer. You want a 20 ouncer? I'm just joking - 
CARL Yes. 
Rooney looks at Peter and Lucy. 
PETER A normal-sized beer is fine with me. 
LUCY I think I'm done actually. 
ROONEY Two twenty ouncers and one tiny, little beer, barkeep. 
BARTENDER Please don't call me that.   We're not in the middle ages. 
ROONEY (to Carl) I can't believe you're out here. I'm giddy. I feel like a child whose best friend has strict Chinese parents who never let him come out and play but now his Chinese parents are away for the Chinese New Year. You have any interest in pounding this shit? 
CARL Why not? 
Rooney picks up his beer and begins pounding the twenty ouncer. Carl reluctantly pounds it as well. Rooney slams his on the table. Carl puts it on the table. 
ROONEY What do you say we have another? 
CARL Yes. 
ROONEY You are a beast! 
LUCY Well, it's been fun watching you guys recreate freshman year, but Peter and I have some furniture errands to run. 
Carl's a little drunk now. 
CARL Have a good day yuppifying your lives. 
PETER We need a sofa, Carl.     We're not buying a second home. 
ROONEY Whatever, yuppy sellouts. 
LUCY It was good seeing you.    You should come out more often. 
CARL (kind of pleading) Please don't leave me here with him. 
Peter and Lucy laugh, not realizing that Carl is serious. They leave. 
INT. RUDY'S - NIGHT 
Carl and Rooney are really drunk. 
CARL I have not been this drunk in years! The room is spinning in a bad way! 
ROONEY Barkeep! Two more double pints s'il vous plait! 
BARTENDER That was the last `barkeep.'   I am cutting you off. 
ROONEY Well fortunately you're not the only game in town! Let's go to some place with class. 
INT. SENOR FROG'S - NIGHT 
Rooney and Carl are in a Senor Frogs. 
CARL Where's the class? 
ROONEY They wear uniforms here.

48    CONTINUED:    (9)                                              48 DAVID The Newsies' demands.   We're on strike. Denton looks around, a little amazed.     He takes out a notebook. 
DENTON I'm Denton, New York Sun.   What's your name? 
DAVID (suspicious) David... 
DENTON David.  As in David and Goliath? (off at doors) You really think old man Pulitzer's going to listen to your demands? DAVID He has to. 
At that instant, the big doors swing open and Jack and Les are spat out like two seeds. JACK (yelling back) So's your ol' lady! Tell Pulitzer he needs an appointment with me! The doors slam shut; Denton scribbles, intrigued. 
49    INT. NEWSPAPERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY                           49 
Jack, David and Les devour a tray of sandwiches as Denton takes notes. Newsmen at other tables glance over curiously as Jack holds forth. 
JACK (a mouthful) -- So this snooty mug is sayin', 'You cawn't see Mr. Pulitzer, no one sees Mr. Pulitzer' -- real hoity-toity, you know the type -- LES (also a mouthful) Real hoity-toity --

LES That's when they threw us out. DENTON Doesn't it scare you going up against the most powerful man in New York? JACK (bravado) Yeah, lookit me, I'm tremblin'. Denton smiles, closes his notebook.    Gets up, handing David a card. DENTON Keep me informed -- I want to know everything that happens. DAVID Are we really an important story...? DENTON What's important? A year ago I covered the war in Cuba -- charging up San Juan Hill with Colonel Teddy Roosevelt. A very important story. Now it doesn't seem so important -- except Teddy's our governor and probably on his way to the White House. Is the Newsies' strike important? It all depends on you. JACK (stopping him) My name really gonna be in the papers? DENTON Any objections? 
JACK Not as long as you get it right -- Kelly, Jack Kelly. And, Denton? No pictures. 
Denton smiles and shrugs.    David suspects Jack's thinking of Snyder.

50    EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE (MATTE SHOT - BROOKLYN SIDE) - DAWN 50 Jack, David, Boots are walking as we WIDEN OUT to reveal the magnificent bridge against a dawn sky. They all seem a little nervous. DAVID I've never been to Brooklyn -- have you guys? 
BOOTS Spent a month there one night. 
DAVID This Spot Conlon... is he really as bad as they say...? 
Jack and Boots look at each other and laugh; they keep laughing as they walk along -- DAVID I say something funny? Come on, tell me -- he bad or not? What's the joke? Tell me, willya? (Etc.) We KEEP WIDENING as the figures get smaller and Jack and Boots keep laughing and David keeps asking about Spot...

55     EXT. BROOKLYN WATERFRONT - DAY                               55 On a rotted and collapsing pier is a battered sign: "BROOKLYN EXCURSIONS - CLOSED." Hunched under the pier is a tough kid playing a harmonica, his eyes fixed on -- -- Jack, Boots, David as they cautiously approach through the no-man's land of mud and junk. Boys appear like hostile Indians -- behind them, to the side of them, in front of them -- silently escorting them under the pier. David looks very nervous as they are halted, and the harmonica plays a signal, then stops abruptly. 
From behind some rotting timbers steps a freckled gnome. He looks them up and down, then grins. He is SPOT CONLON. SPOT If it ain't Jack be nimble, Jack be quick.

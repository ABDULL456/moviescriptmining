INT. KITCHEN - SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY 
It's like a Norman Rockwell cover come to life. Every inch of counter space is filled with platters of food. John watches Sarah, Annie, and a boisterous ASSORTMENT OF RELATIVES put the finishing touches to the Thanksgiving feast. KIDS rush in and out in a manic game of tag. John is captivated by the sense of family and celebration -- things he's never known in his own life. Sarah steps over. She's wearing a funky-cool vintage dress. 
SARAH Come on, we're on gravy-boat duty. 
INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY 
The table is decorated with garlands of autumn leaves and an elaborate pine cone centerpiece. Sarah places the last turkey-shaped gravy boat onto the table. She smiles at John. 
SARAH You look dazed. 
JOHN Just taking it all in. She crosses. 
SARAH I'm glad you came. They tenderly kiss until Annie bustles in carrying a steaming bowl of mashed potatoes. 
ANNIE Don't mind me. She puts the bowl on the table and grabs Sarah's camera. 
ANNIE Let's get a picture of you two lovebirds. Sarah cringes as Annie lifts the camera to her eye. 
SARAH Mom. No. John really doesn't like having his -- 
JOHN It's okay. Let her take it. The gesture means the world to Sarah. He puts his arm around her. Sarah nestles her face against his. As the flash WIPES 
OUT THE FRAME... 
CUT TO: 
INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Red candles flicker. Sarah's DAD is expertly carving the turkey. Everybody is at the table. John sits next to Sarah. She holds his hand under the table. It's Hallmark worthy until the carriage clock on the mantel CHIMES. 
IT'S SIX O'CLOCK. 
John looks at his phone. No messages. His brow creases with concern. He turns to Sarah, whispers. 
JOHN I need to check in with Henri. He exits. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
John speed dials as he steps out into the cold. He holds the phone to his ear. It rings three times and then is answered. 
JOHN 
(INTO PHONE) Henri? CLICK. The call is hung up. Suddenly on edge, John redials. This time it's picked up immediately. 
JOHN 
(INTO PHONE) Henri? 
MAN (V.O.) 
(OVER PHONE) Are you one of them too? John reacts to the chilling menace of the Man's tone. 
JOHN 
(INTO PHONE) Who are you? Where's Henri? CLICK. John jerks the phone from his ear and stares at it, panicked. He paces, desperate and unsure, then gets an idea and punches another number. 
JOHN 
(INTO PHONE) I need your help. 
INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The food is getting cold. Everybody is waiting for John. Sarah catches her mother's disapproving look.

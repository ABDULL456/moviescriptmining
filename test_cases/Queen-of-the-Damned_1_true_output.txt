CUT TO: 
184   EXT. AKASHA'S PLANTATION VILLA - NIGHT                         184 
Lestat and Akasha stand on a cliff-top. WIND rips through the trees. Everywhere, there are torches, and a million candles light the vast house. Lestat and Akasha glide past the forest of exotic flowers... Past the fountains and statues -- up the steps to the open French doors. Long white curtains billow in the sea wind. 
LESTAT Where are we? 
AKASHA We are home. 
LESTAT You live here? 
AKASHA We live everywhere and anywhere we choose. The world is our garden. 
185   INT. AKASHA'S PLANTATION VILLA - NIGHT                         185 
Lestat steps in through billowing curtains, stops... There are three West Indian girls, young, voluptuous, beautiful, dressed in simple working clothes and traditional head-wraps. They stare at Lestat, nervous, yet fascinated. They move towards him. Lestat finds himself surrounded by hands, touching him, reaching beneath his shirt, pulling his clothes from his body. He swoons, closes his eyes, smiles. 
LESTAT So warm... (sniffs their skin) ... their blood... 
AKASHA ... yes... 
LESTAT ... they're mortal...

AKASHA ... of course. They serve the living goddess, and her consort. They find you beautiful. You are a god in their eyes.

... golden dark hands pull clothes away from Lestat's white skin... breasts strain through white linen as they press themselves closer to him... the surface of water, scented with red rose petals. Lestat's white skin breaks the surface. Lestat is lowered into the bath, his skin alive with the dancing candles reflected in the water... the water laps gently -- strange sighs of pleasure as girls' hands caress Lestat's torso... their hands reach down lower and lower through the water... Lestat's eyes remain closed but his mouth opens... Now it's Akasha kissing him. Lestat responds, but his eyes sneak a peek. Akasha smiles -- takes his head in her hands -- she kisses him, pushes him back -- he tries to resist -- he can't, startled by her strength... Akasha kisses his neck, his chest, bites... Lestat arches in ecstasy... Akasha rises up from his breast, blood on her lips, smiles, goes back down and drinks.

187   AKASHA AND LESTAT - LATER                                      187 
now moved to the bed, surrounded by the fine nets... kissing, probing each other's bodies, floating above the bed... Akasha rolls him over -- smiles down at him -- a fang exposed... She draws her wrist across her mouth... a globule of blood smacks Lestat's open lips... Flash -- A thousand images in a second. Lestat jolted as if by a million volts. Blood smears their bodies -- they bathe in it. 
188   CLOSE ON LESTAT                                                188 
The most lascivious smile spreading over his face, even as the waves of pleasure still course through him, causing his mouth to twitch and tremble. He closes his eyes... 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
189   SAME SCENE - LESTAT (LATER)                                     189 
opens his eyes. He sits up alone in the canopied bed, disoriented. Akasha is nowhere to be seen. He looks toward the window. The sun is just about to disappear below the horizon. Lestat stares, amazed, blinking... Shielding his eyes, Lestat goes to window, gazes in awe at the setting sun. As the last rays slice through the sky, Lestat closes his eyes, stretches his arms out, feels the warm sun on his skin. He smiles at this feeling he's craved for so long. Still smiling, he opens his eyes, blinking from the light. He turns, gazes towards the bath and gasps. The dying light illuminates... The servant girls' bodies, now grey with death, lying around the edge of the bath. The roses are now black and the water is colored a rich deep red... 
190   INT. PLANTATION HOUSE - HALLWAY                                 190 
Lestat steps into the hallway, stares at dead bodies sprinkling the ground -- both servants formally dressed, and guests in white tropical evening dress... 
191   INT. PLANTATION HOUSE - DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION         191 
The candles have all melted, forming pools that spread across the lace cloth. Food sits uneaten on plates. The last of the sun's rays strikes ten dead bodies sitting around the table, some slumped onto their food, some frozen in death. Lestat moves through the room, a feeling of dread spreading. We FOLLOW as he moves... 
192   EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS ACTION                                  192 
... out the French windows onto the beach, bodies of servants and villagers are scattered. Lestat's feet step down the wooden stairs, onto the sand, through the bodies... 
Lestat, shielding his eyes, stares up in horror at the pink sky. 
AKASHA Behold our Kingdom. 
Lestat sees Akasha standing further down on the beach. 
LESTAT Why? 
(CONTINUED) 
192   CONTINUED:                                                      192 
AKASHA (puzzled) Why not? 
LESTAT This is the reason you have risen? 
AKASHA They believed in nothing, now they are nothing. But you and I will change all that. We will give the world something to believe in again. 
Akasha smiles, raises her hand, suddenly slices her wrist with a knife. Lestat stares at her dripping blood. She crosses to him, her eyes locked on his. She lifts her wrist, drips her blood into Lestat's mouth. Lestat's eyes glaze over again. He smiles, feeds hungrily, lost again. Akasha smiles. 
AKASHA Come, my King.      We have a score to settle. 
The Queen and her King swiftly fly up into the darkness.

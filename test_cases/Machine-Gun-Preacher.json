CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT \nIt's late and we see Lynn sitting at the kitchen table alone. Sam has not come home and she is clearly worried. And then we hear a car pulling up outside, door opening and closing, and Sam coming into the trailer. \nSAM Sorry I'm late. \nLynn staring at him, trying to read this man's face but he's not looking at her. Avoiding her gaze. Did he use? Is he high? And then she sees a PINPRICK OF DRIED BLOOD on his shirtsleeve. Her face contorting almost imperceptibly. Her worst fear realized. Relapse. \nAnd she moves to him without saying a word... lifts up his arm and unbuttons the cuff of his shirt... slowly pushing up his shirtsleeve to discover a NEEDLE PRICK in his arm... \n... and then he pulls out a $20 bill and hands it to her. \nSAM (CONT'D) Gave blood over in Pitt. \nLynn searching his eyes and she knows he's telling the truth. \nSAM (CONT'D) That's all I got. \nAnd she pulls him close, hugging him tight, grateful. \nLYNN Somethin will come through.

CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe first thing we notice is the relative \"opulence\" of this place... deep shag, new color TV, matching sectional sofa... the rural idea of making it. Sam, Lynn, Daisy and Paige at the dinner table eating. Sam in his own world, oblivious to the MINOR CONVERSATION until -- \nLYNN Paige, go get some more beans. \nPaige heads to the kitchen. \nLYNN (CONT'D) What are you thinking? \nSAM Thinking about Africa. \nPaige comes back in carrying the beans. \nPAIGE They have tigers over there? \nSAM (JOKINGLY) They eat people! \nLYNN What about Africa? \nSAM Just thinkin bout that fella today. \nPAIGE He talked funny. \nLYNN Just from a different place than us, baby, that's all. \nSAM Was thinkin maybe I'd go over there.

A bit. \nSAM Double-feed? \nDENG Sometimes. \nSAM Lemme have a look... \nDeng hesitates, then hands his AK over to Sam who pops the mag out and studies it... \nSAM (CONT'D) Yer mag is tight.

ROAD - DEEP IN SUDAN - DAY \nThe scene of the ambush the night before. Burned out pickup trucks and dead LRA rebels strewn in the dirt. Sam's SUV arriving and he's the first one out... whistling for the children but they're nowhere to be seen. \nAnd now we realize that the column of smoke isn't coming from the bombed-out LRA trucks -- it's coming from behind them. Sam moving around the back of the TRANSPORT TRUCK to see -- \nTHIRTEEN LITTLE BODIES STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER \nThe children Sam left behind. \nBurned alive by the LRA an hour earlier. \nSam just standing here, staring at this smoldering pile of children. Starting to go someplace very dark. And as he puts it, most of him died in the bush this morning too. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

And the CUSTOMS OFFICER waves him forward... Sam handing him his passport... \nCUSTOMS OFFICER Sudan? \nAnd he looks up, studies Sam -- \nCUSTOMS OFFICER (CONT'D) What are you doing over there? \nAnd we see Sam has no answer for him.

{"train": "MACHINE GUN PREACHER \nWritten by \nJason Keller \nbased on the life of Sam Childers \nFINAL SHOOTING DRAFT \nThis is true... \nEXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - (2003) \nThe night is stillborn. \nWithout sound or movement and nothing is in definition. All we see are degrees of blackness in this unlit world. The vague impressions of an African village in the void... a ragged line of tukuls (straw huts)... a bicycle propped against a mud wall... a soccer ball in the dirt... \nINT. TUKUL - NIGHT \nAnd we find a Sudanese family asleep on reed mats. A mother, father and their two boys. The younger boy we'll come to know as \"WILLIAM\" (9). His older brother \"CHRISTOPHER\" (12) curled next to him. \nEXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT \nAnd slowly the blackness begins to shift... an otherworldly light seeping in from someplace far off... shadows contorting in a ghostly orange flicker... images emerging... the silhouettes of men coming into this village carrying flaming torches. \nINT. TUKUL - NIGHT \nThe family still sound asleep, oblivious to the torch glow coming from outside, and suddenly -- \nSCREAMING! -- GUNSHOTS! \nThe family bolts awake, moving to their feet as the door to their tukul SLAMS open -- THREE soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) coming in carrying AK47's -- shouting in Arabic -- \"Get up! Get up!\" -- the FATHER stepping forward -- holding up his hands -- \"Don't shoot!\" -- \nKAK! KAK! KAK! \nAnd he's gunned down in cold blood. The soldiers grab the mother and boys and begin to drag them out of the tukul -- but WILLIAM breaks free -- scrambles deeper into the room -- \nTHE SOLDIER going after him -- WILLIAM darting behind a stack of storage boxes knocking them to the ground -- frantically burrowing into the corner -- trying to get away but it's useless -- THE SOLDIER grabs his feet and begins to pull him out -- WILLIAM KICKING WILDLY -- digging his nails into the dirt -- and as he's dragged out of the corner he reaches out... inadvertently grabs a FADED PHOTOGRAPH which has fallen on the ground... \nEXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT \nCHAOS! -- PANDEMONIUM! -- the black sky ablaze in apocalyptic fire -- \nfamilies yanked out of their burning tukuls by LRA rebels -- the adult males of this village shot dead or bludgeoned to death -- the women and children forced into the center of the village -- huddled together and weeping -- \n-- and now we see WILLIAM hauled out -- his captor shouting to another soldier -- pointing to WILLIAM'S mother and she's pulled from the group and forced onto her knees... \n... and WILLIAM is brought in front of her -- his captor saying something in Arabic as he hands him a club -- \"Kill her!\" -- WILLIAM shaking his head `no' -- tossing the club in the dirt and -- \nCRACKKK! -- WILLIAM is hit with the butt of a rifle -- goes down -- blood streaming down his face as he's pulled back up to his feet -- crying -- shaking with fear... \n... and then he sees his mother staring up at him... and despite the hell unfolding around them we see a moment here between mother and son... something calm and reassuring in the way she's looking at him now... her eyes full of love... and pity... for her child in this terrible moment... and before we see how this ends we -- \nCUT TO: \nBLACKNESS \nFOR A LONG BEAT -- AND THEN WE BLEED UP WHITE LETTERS ON THE BLACK SCREEN THAT READ -- \nMACHINEGUN PREACHER ... AND THEN THE ECHOED VOICES OF MEN YELLING TO ONE ANOTHER... BOOMING MUSIC... TAUNTS... WHISTLES... AN ANNOUNCEMENT, INAUDIBLE, OVER A LOUDSPEAKER... TAKING US TO... \nINT. PRISON CORRIDOR - RURAL PENNSYLVANIA - DAY - (AUGUST/1998) \nAnd we see SAM CHILDERS coming down a corridor toward us, dressed in jailhouse orange and flanked by a guard. He's stocky, 32 years old, with a biker's handlebar moustache. On the surface he appears good- looking... even handsome if the light is right... but his face is tricky... always changing... behind the quick smile, around his dark eyes, in the taut muscles of his neck we see violence. \nINT. PRISON RECEIVING AND RELEASING - DAY \nWe see a CLERK handing Sam a prison issue tub full of his personal affects. He takes out his clothes, digs out a leather wallet, a watch, some silver rings and a lighter. \nHe looks up to the Clerk and flashes a malicious smile -- \nSAM Ya'll go fuck yourself now, k? \nEXT. PRISON - DAY \nA beat-up CHEVY VEGA parked at the curb. Sam's wife, LYNN, 30's, in a thrift store dress, leaning against the car, waiting. \nSam (dressed in civilian clothes now) pushes out a door and she sees him, straightens her hair, an uneasy smile. \nLYNN Hey baby. \nEXT SIDE OF ROAD/INT. LYNN'S CAR - DAY \nThe Vega pulled of the side of the road and Sam fucking Lynn in the back. There's nothing tender about what we're watching here. Sam finishes and Lynn slumps into the seat, pulls down her dress. \nSAM Gimme a smoke. \nLYNN Don't got any. \nSAM What, you quit? (LYNN NODS) Shit, that ain't gonna last. \nEXT. MOBILE HOME PARK - DAY \nThe Vega pulls up to a beat-to-shit single-wide and Sam and Lynn get out. We see a homemade sign hanging outside the trailer that reads, \"Welcome Home Daddy!\" \nAnd now Sam's daughter PAIGE (6) bursts out of the trailer and down the steps... Followed by Sam's mother, DAISY, mid 60's, comes out of the trailer. \nPAIGE DADDY! \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nSam riding down the road. \nINT. CROSSROADS BAR - NIGHT \nA tough biker bar in Johnstown, PA. A jukebox in the corner playing Lynard Skynard. Sam coming through the door, AD-LIBBED greetings from some of the other bikers here. He makes his way to a back table where a hulking biker in a leather vest named DONNIE is sitting with two girls. Donnie looks up, sees Sam... \nDONNIE Crazyhorse! There he is... \nThey embrace, old friends. \nDONNIE (CONT'D) Figured you'd be rollin out round now. How you doin, buddy? \nSAM I'm doin. \nDONNIE (to one of the girls) Get us a coupla shots and buds. (SAM SITS) Don't look too worse for the wear. \nSAM I'm alright. \nDONNIE Heard yer old lady ain't at the Bunny Hop no more. \nSAM Bitch found Jesus. \nDONNIE Damn! That bearded sonuvagun slipped her the high holy dick while you was in the can, huh? Better him than the milk man, I guess. \nSAM Ain't so sure bout that. \nDonnie laughs, slaps him on the shoulder... \nDONNIE You wanna taste? \nSam smiles that wicked smile and we go -- \nINT. BACK HALLWAY - THE CROSSROADS BAR - NIGHT \n-- as a biker chick leads Sam down this hallway into -- \nINT. BATHROOM - THE CROSSROADS BAR - NIGHT \nSam and the biker chick crammed into this dirty stall, Skynard pounding through the walls. He rolls up his shirt sleeve as she cooks a spoon of methamphetamine... juices a hypodermic... he finds a vein and she spikes his arm... presses the plunger and his head rolls back on his shoulders... speed slamming into his bloodstream as we RAMP UP THE MUSIC. \nINT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - MORNING - WEEKS LATER - (DECEMBER/1998) \nSnow piled up on the windowsills and it's cold as shit outside. Sam passed out on the couch and this guy looks like hell. \nThinner than the last time we saw him, skin sallow and drawn tight over his face. He stirs awake, sees Paige playing by herself on the floor next to him. She sees that he's awake, picks up her doll, and quietly goes outside without saying a word. \nINT. BATHROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - MORNING \nSam coming in, taking a piss, staring at himself in the mirror and we see a junkie map of track marks running up and down his arms. And then WE HEAR a Pentecostal communion hymn, \"the Old Rugged Cross\", coming through... taking us to... \nINT. CHURCH - JOHNSTOWN, PA. - DAY \nA congregation packed into this church for Sunday service. We see Lynn and Paige in the crowd, singing along with the congregation. \nEXT. DOPE HOUSE STREET/INT. DONNIE'S CAR - NIGHT \nSam and Donnie in this car, parked in front of broken down clapboard houses. Donnie pointing through the windshield... \nDONNIE Right there. With the green light. \nEXT. PORCH - DOPE HOUSE - NIGHT \nBone chill cold. Sam and Donnie on this porch, scarves pulled around their necks, hands shoved into their jackets trying to stay warm. Donnie KNOCKING at the door... \nDONNIE Hey, man, you there?! Open up... \nDonnie KNOCKING again and the door cracks an inch... and we see a black man with a SHAVED HEAD on the other side looking out... \nSHAVED HEAD Fuck are you? \nDONNIE It's me, man, c'mon. Fuckin cold out here. \nSHAVED HEAD I don't know you. \nDONNIE Yeah you do, man. I saw you the other day. I'm Bobby's friend. \nSHAVED HEAD Who the fuck is Bobby? \nSuddenly Sam pulls a short barrel shotgun from his jacket -- MOSSBERG 10 GAGE -- presses it to the door and -- \nBOOOM! \nINT. DOPE HOUSE - SAME \nDOOR SPLINTERING OPEN! -- concussion like a fucking pipe bomb -- wood splintering through the room like shrapnel -- Sam and Donnie STORMING IN... \nDONNIE Don't fuckin move! \nINSTANT PANDEMONIUM! -- JUNKIES hopping off the couch, scattering like rats deeper into the house -- SHAVED HEAD darting out of the room -- Sam leveling the MOSSBERG in his direction -- \nBOOOM! -- the room flashing like a fucking supernova. \nINT. STAIRWAY- DOPE HOUSE - SAME \nSHAVED HEAD scrambling up these stairs -- Sam coming up after him -- hunting him -- MOSSBERG BLASTING in his direction -- BOOOM! -- \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DOPE HOUSE - SAME \nSuddenly -- silver flashing -- A BLADE -- out of nowhere -- pressed into Donnie's neck from the backseat -- the Drifter pulling him tight against the seat rest, pressing it into his throat -- \nDONNIE What the fuck?! \nDRIFTER Keep drivin! Dunshore or I'll cut his fuckin throat. \nSAM Get that fuckin blade off him... \nSam reaches his leg over and STOMPS ON THE GAS PEDDLE -- the car LURCHES forward -- accelerating -- \nDONNIE Sam! \nDRIFTER SLOW THE FUCK DOWN! \nBut Sam's not letting up... pressing down on the peddle hard... 90... 100... 110 mph -- Donnie YELLING -- trying to keep the car on the road -- MUSIC BLARING -- like some wild ride to hell and then -- \nSAM SUDDENLY JUMPS IN THE BACKSEAT -- wrestling with the drifter -- fighting wild -- elbowing him in the face and somehow the blade is in his hand now -- and -- \nStick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick! \nHe stabs him six times in the gut. The drifter HOWLING in pain. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT \nDonnie's car skidding off the shoulder of the road, back door popping open and the Drifter's body dumped into the dirt. The car PEELS OUT, accelerates, tail lights disappearing into the dark. \nINT. BEDROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT \nLynn sound asleep in bed. And she slowly stirs awake, hears water running from somewhere in the trailer. \nINT. HALLWAY AND BATHROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT \nLynn moving down the hall... toward a sliver of light coming from under the closed bathroom door... gently pushing it open to see -- \nSam standing at the sink... covered in blood... frantically trying to clean himself up... trying to wash the sin from his skin and clothes but it's useless... and the sense we get is that we're staring at a man at the edge of an abyss... set to swallow him whole... terrified... shaking... \n... and now he realizes Lynn is here and he turns to her... holding up his stained hands... a terrible fear in his eyes when he says... \nSAM Help me. \nEXT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY \nDays later and we see Lynn and Paige, dressed up, sitting in the idling car, waiting. \nPAIGE He comin or ain't he? \nLYNN I don't know. \nINT. BEDROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY \nAnd we find Sam in this bedroom all alone, wearing a thrift store sportcoat, sitting on the edge of the bed. Frozen. Staring at his stocking feet and three or four pairs of workboots scattered on the floor. \nLynn steps into the doorway... \nVOICE (O.S.) Honey? You ready? \nSam turns to her, and he looks lost here. Like a little boy. \nSAM I don't got no good shoes, Lynn. \nAnd she comes into the room, sits on the bed next to him, puts an arm around his shoulder. \nLYNN He don't care what kinda shoes you wearin, baby. \nINT. BAPTISM CHURCH - JOHNSTOWN, PA. - DAY \nPacked with Sunday families listening to Pastor Krause at the pulpit. Behind him we see a BAPTISMAL TANK filled with water. And now we see Sam, Lynn, Paige, and Daisy sitting near the back. Sam looks uncomfortable, on edge. \nPASTOR KRAUSE The point of receiving God's word is life. Life upon life. And to accept the blood of Jesus is life upon life upon life... \nCONGREGATION Praise be to God! \nPASTOR KRAUSE He breathes his spirit into darkness and makes something good. He sees our shadow and says, `let there be light!\" \nCONGREGATION Amen! \nPASTOR KRAUSE ... now proclaim his saving grace! If there are sinners here looking for God raise your hands! \nA few hands shoot up -- \nPASTOR KRAUSE (CONT'D) Stand up! Receive Jesus Christ as your light and saviour... \nThree or four people moving to their feet, making their way up to the altar. Lynn turns to Sam, their eyes meet. He looks hesitant, unsure. She gives him a reserved little smile, nods her head slightly as if saying \"you can do this\"... \nAnd in her look he finds strength, gets up, slowly makes his way to... \nFRONT ALTAR \nAnd now we see Sam on his knees in the baptismal tank. The water almost up to his waist. Pastor Krause kneeling behind him. \nPASTOR KRAUSE (CONT'D) Receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour... in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost... \n... and he leans Sam back, cradling his head as he submerges him in the water completely... and when Sam comes back up the church breaks into ROWDY HALLELUJAHS!... and we see Lynn... tears in her eyes... \nclapping in the back row... and an organist and singer begin to sing \"Amazing Grace\" taking us to... \nOMITTED \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY - (JUNE/1999) \n... Sam and Deng crammed into this crowded bus... \nSAM They always drive this fast? \nDENG Traveling is the most dangerous time in Sudan. If the rebels find you on the open road it would be very bad. \nAn awkward silence as Deng stares out the window. Sam wanting to connect here, but Deng is reticent. \nSAM You got kids, Deng? \nDENG No. I have no children. \nSAM Where you from? \nDENG A little village called Aweil. Many hours from here. \nSAM That's where your family is? \nAnd Deng simply says... \nDENG My family was killed by LRA. (BEAT) Unyama is about two hours from here. We will stop there for lunch. \nDeng turns and looks out the window again, silent, quietly watching the land blur past. And Sam says nothing more, intuitively feeling this man's need to be alone in the moment. A great, lost giant. \nEXT. UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY \nA dense sea of people. 20,000 displaced refugees living on top of each other. \nLife is lived out in the open here... women bent over brightly colored washtubs sloshing clothes in soapy water... smoke from giant cooking pots drifting into the air... semi-clothed children, some with even younger children on their hips, running everywhere. The poverty and hopelessness is overwhelming. \nAnd we see Sam and Deng walking through the camp... \nDENG The Muslim North has tried to kill the Christian South for 30 years. Two million have lost their lives... \nDeng sweeping his hand, indicating the mass of refugees. \nDENG (CONT'D) ... these people have been driven from their villages, however these camps are not much better... \nEXT. MEDICAL AREA - UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY \nA row of wood sheds and worn nylon tents marks the hospital area. Each enclosure jammed with the desperately sick. Battle-weary AID WORKERS move among them, doing what they can, caring for the ones who are most desperately ill. \nDENG Cholera and Malaria are everywhere, there is little food and not enough UN soldiers to protect everyone. Even here they worry the LRA will attack at night. \nAnd another SPLA soldier comes up to Deng -- \nSPLA SOLDIER 1 (ARABIC) Are you from Kitgum? \nDENG (ARABIC) Yes. \nSPLA SOLDIER 1 (ARABIC) Someone wants to speak with you. \nDeng turns to Sam... \nDENG I'm sorry, Sam... I'll be five minutes. \nSAM Course, do what you gotta do. \nDeng leaves and now Sam is completely alone, taking in this mire of humanity all around him. And suddenly there's COMMOTION! -- two aid workers coming into this tent carrying a WOMAN on a stretcher. One of the aid workers looking around -- a white woman -- mid 30's -- her name is AGNETE CLOSSON, Regional Director of Doctors Without Borders. She sees Sam across the tent. \nAGNETE Excuse me. You. Can you help please? \nSam moving to her -- \nAGNETE (CONT'D) We need to transfer her to the bed. Get her shoulders... \nSam grabbing the woman underneath the shoulders as another aid worker gets her feet... \nAGNETE (CONT'D) One, two, three... \nAnd they swing the woman over to a cot... but as they do the sheer piece of blood-stained muslin that was covering her face falls away... and we see that she has been mutilated... her lips cut off of her face... \n... and now a DOCTOR sweeps into the tent and begins to work on her. Sam and Agnete pushed back, away from the action. Sam still shocked by what he's seen. \nSAM What happened to her face? \nAGNETE The rebels cut off her lips because she argued. These are Kony's orders. \nSAM Who's Kony? \nAgnete, suddenly suspicious, takes an appraising look of Sam. \nAGNETE Who are you with? \nSAM I'm with Deng over there. \nAGNETE What organization are you with? \nSAM Working with a Christian group down South. Just up here takin a look around, seein a bit of the country. \nAGNETE This isn't a tourist destination, this is a war zone. You stay in this area, you'll be killed. (BEAT) Thank you for your help. \nAnd she walks off. \nEXT. NIMULE, SUDAN - DUSK \nEstablishing a bustling trading center on the border of Uganda and Sudan. Noisy and overpopulated, a maze of concrete and tin buildings, hundreds of people on the streets, riding bicycles, finishing their business before nightfall. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT \nDENG The LRA attacked a village last night. \nSam looking up to him... \nDENG (CONT'D) You said you wanted to see. \nSam sits up, looks around the hotel room and we see that it's empty... the children vanished... only a small, handmade toy on the ground which has been left behind. \nINT. PICKUP TRUCK - DRIVING - RURAL SUDAN - DAY \nSam, Deng, and a few other SPLA SOLDIERS jammed into the flatbed of this truck, carrying heavy weapons, bouncing fast over this open dirt road... featureless savanna FADING into sporadic mud huts... the outskirts of a VILLAGE in the distance... and thin columns of black smoke twisting into the air... \n... and as the truck gets closer to the village we begin to pass CHILDREN walking along the side of the road... night commuters returning to their village... some of them huddled together, weeping... \n... and we notice -- Sam notices -- the little boy in the GREEN SHORTS, walking hand-in-hand with his sister, their faces quiet masks of fear as they move closer to their home. \nEXT. VILLAGE - YEI, SUDAN - DAY \nThe pickup arrives and Sam, Deng, and the other soldiers hop out... and this is what they see: \nComplete devastation. 30 or 40 bodies mutilated and stacked outside smoking tukuls. Some children already here, on their knees, weeping next to the corpses of their parents. If you could smell the air it would smell of burnt flesh and death. \nSam silent, aghast, just staring at the horror all around him... \n... and now we see GREEN SHORTS and his sister arriving at the village... moving to their family's tukul and discovering their mother and father piled outside. Naked and burned alive. And the sister falls onto her mother's corpse and begins to wail as GREEN SHORTS stands there -- frozen -- staring down at his dead parents -- and suddenly -- \nMOVEMENT! -- from inside the tukul... a small dog... a family pet... darting into the open... running across the dirt... GREEN SHORTS going after it, yelling his name... \nSam watching the boy chasing after his dog, rounding a corner out of sight... \n... for a moment... \n... just the boy's voice calling after his dog... and then... \nBOOOOM! \nA muffled burst -- in the distance -- Sam, Deng, and the other soldiers running out of the village toward the explosion... \nEXT. DIRT ROAD - YEI, SUDAN - DAY \n... Sam, Deng, and the others arriving at the source of the explosion. And we see GREEN SHORTS laying on the side of the road... cut in half by a land mine... his dead eyes wide open with surprise... \n... and Sam drops to his knees... lifting what's left of the boy into his arms and rocking him back and forth... and we watch as a terrible sadness overtakes him... something happening here... a fierce and overwhelming burden dropping into this man as he holds this dead boy... in the dirt... in the middle of this savage world... \n... and as Sam puts it, his \"life changed forever\" in this moment... and we see him looking up to the heavens... \ntears streaming down his face... saying something we can't hear, but it's a promise... to God... \nTo save the children of Sudan. \nINT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - DAY \nA bright, fluorescent corridor filled with garish advertising and harried travelers rushing to make planes... and we find Sam coming down this concourse, carrying his duffle bag, his face expressionless. He reaches a revolving door but stops... doesn't pass through... sees Lynn, Paige, and his mother waiting for him on the other side... their happy, expectant faces... \nBut they don't see him yet... and he just stays here... hidden... watching them through the glass... and as Sam puts it, at this moment he realized he would never look at his own family the same way again... in some way lost to them forever after what he saw on the side of road in Yei... \n... and finally he forces a smile, pushes through the revolving door and we watch, from this side of the glass, as Paige leaps into his arms... Lynn and Daisy moving to him too, embracing him, welcoming him home. \nINT. BATHROOM - PAIGE'S ROOM - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT \nPaige brushing her teeth at the sink. Sam watching her from the doorway... \nPAIGE You see any tigers over there? \nSAM Naw, didn't see no tigers. \nPAIGE But they do have them over in Africa. \nSAM So I hear, but not where I was. \nPAIGE Sure am glad you're home. \nSAM Me too, bug. \nPAIGE I'm thinkin of a plane... \nSAM It's late, you better get to bed... \nAnd he grabs her and carries her into the bedroom, plops her onto the bed... \nPAIGE C'mon, plane... I'm thinkin of a plane... \nSam giving in, playing their little game as she gets under the covers... \nSAM You said plane, I'm thinkin of a train... \nPAIGE You said train, I'm thinkin of a brain. \nSAM You said brain, I'm thinkin of a... (HESITATING) \nPAIGE Gotcha! \nSAM Ok, you got me. \nPAIGE You coulda said drain, or mane... like horse's hair. \nSam bending over, kissing her forehead... \nSAM Sweet dreams, bug. \nShe runs off. \nBIKER (CONT'D) Goddamn, they grow up quick, don't they? \nSAM Sure do. \nBIKER Hey, nuthin fer nuthin, Sam, but rumor has it you was puttin up a chapel over there in Central City. \nSAM That's right. Gonna minister to anybody who's lookin for The Lord. \nBIKER That's good, man. Maybe you can do somethin bout your old friend, Donnie. \nSAM What about em? \nBIKER He ain't doin so good, bro. But hey, good seein ya' man. \nEXT. CRACK HOUSE - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY \nA torn up house in a shitty part of town, windows spray painted black. Sam pulls up to the curb on his Harley, gets off, opens one of the bike's hard cases and pulls out the same SAWED OFF 10 gage we've seen before... chambers a slug as he moves toward the house... \nINT. CRACK HOUSE - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY \nDark, junkie squalor. Two or three people slumped on a ratty couch, strung-out, watching a flickering TV -- and then -- \nTHE FRONT DOOR CAVES IN! \nSam coming into the house -- sawed-off leveled -- junkies scrambling for cover -- YELLING! -- CHAOS! -- Sam moving into -- \nINT. CRACK HOUSE - BACK ROOM - DAY \nSam comes around the corner and finds himself face-to-face with a CRACKHEAD pointing a .357 MAGNUM -- eyes amped up and wild -- shaking -- a stand-off -- and Sam sees a body on a bare mattress in the b.g. -- bone thin and pale -- spent hypodermic hanging out of his arm -- \nIt's Donnie. \nSAM I'm here for that boy right there. You gonna get in the way a that? \nA TENSE BEAT -- not sure how this is gonna go -- and then the CRACKHEAD shakes his head \"no\" \nINT. CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY \nDonnie in a bed, covers pulled up to his neck and he's shaking bad, retching in a bucket, deep in the throes of a detox. Sam and Lynn here doing what they can, toweling off his forehead, trying to keep him warm, as Donnie pulls the sheets tighter, gritting his teeth, shaking his head. \nDONNIE I can't do this. \nSAM Look at me. God don't make trash, boy. Now he ain't givin up on you, so don't give up on him, you hear me? \nAnd somehow Donnie finds strength in his words, and in Sam's hand touching his head, and he nods. \nEXT. RURAL ROAD - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY - (AUGUST/2003) \nA bright Sunday morning and we're staring at the cinder block church which is almost completely finished... the sound of a garage band coming from inside, playing an unlikely rendition of a spiritual hymn... and a handful of people, dressed for service, moving up the cement stairs into... \nINT. ENTRY HALL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY \nAnd we see Donnie, dressed in his biker jacket and a buttondown shirt, sober for the moment, greeting people as they come through the front door. Standing next to him is Daisy handing out programs. \nDONNIE Welcome to Shekinah Fellowship Church. \nINT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - CENTRAL CITY - DAY \nStill under construction. Exposed beams and bare insulation on the walls. There's a small riser at the front of the hall with an altar, organ, and the GARAGE BAND playing the rocked-out hymn. \nA handful of people here sitting in pews. FARMERS in clean overalls, FACTORY WORKERS, BIKERS still dressed in their riding leathers, listening to the garage band and chatting. \nAnd now we see Lynn and Paige (11) standing near the back. Lynn nervous, checking her watch. \nINT. FOYER - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY \nSam on his knees, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, wrenching a leaking pipe. Lynn and Daisy walk in... \nLYNN It's five-til and he still ain't here. \nSam hearing this, moving to his feet, toweling off his hands. \nSAM You call him? (LYNN NODS) Try him again. \nLynn exits and Daisy steps forward, shuts the door behind her. Just she and Sam here alone now. \nDAISY You like this dress, Sam? \nSAM What, mom? \nDAISY You ain't never seen this one. I bought it a long time ago. Been keepin it for a special occasion. \nSAM It's nice. \nDAISY I never told you this but when I was pregnant with you, now this was way back, probably 1960, when yer daddy and I was still in Grand Rapids, a Pastor prophesied over me. Pulled me right up on stage and laid his hands on my belly and told me I was gonna have a Preacher for a son. (smiling at the thought) Yer daddy and I were so proud. I remember we went home and neither of us could sleep all night. Just laid there and talked bout you, bout what was comin. \nSAM I just built a church. I ain't no preacher. \nDAISY Yes you are. You were born to it. Just took you a little ways to get here. \nINT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY \nSam entering at the back of the chapel, taking a moment to appreciate what he's looking at: 20 or 30 people here in the church that he built. A dream realized. And he walks down the center aisle, shaking hands with a few people, climbing steps to the altar and switching on the microphone... \nSAM (to the band) Thank you, Tommy. You boys is soundin pretty good up here. \nSam turning to the crowd, clearing his throat, clearly nervous. \nSam pointing to the map. The Administrator turning to Deng -- \nADMINISTRATOR (ARABIC) He should not be this far north. \nSAM What are you sayin? \nADMINISTRATOR The villages in this area are very remote, Mr. Childers. There is nothing there. \nSAM Then it seems to me them people need help the most. \nADMINISTRATOR (to Deng, Arabic) He will be killed. \nSAM Talk to me. \nThe Administrator turning to him, laying it out simply -- \nADMINISTRATOR This is in the war zone, Mr. Childers. The LRA will kill you here. \nSAM I don't think you understand me, so lemme make it real clear to ya. I didn't pick this land -- God did. \nEXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANGE - SUDAN - DAY - THREE MONTHS LATER \nWhat we're looking at is the modest beginning of The Angels of East Africa Children's Orphanage. A cluster of tukuls and 2 or 3 rudimentary wood buildings built on the dirt Sam first let trickle between his fingers. \nAnd we see life already finding it's place within these bamboo walls. Acholi WORKERS laying brick on what will eventually become a schoolhouse and chapel. \nAnd we find Sam with two or three small CHILDREN who are crying for no apparent reason. He's on his knees, trying his best to soothe them but he is way out of his depth here. \nAnd now we see Deng in the b.g. approaching with a powerfully built Ugandan woman in her late 40's. \nDENG (INTRODUCING) Sam... this is Betty. She is from the village of Kotido. A few miles from here. \nSAM Good to meet you Betty. \nBetty, no reaction. Just the incessant crying of the children in the b.g. \nDENG She is knowing that you need someone to run the orphanage. \nSAM I'm lookin for somebody who can keep the place in order. Make sure things is taken care of when I'm away. \nDENG She can do this. \nSAM She's gonna have to take care of the children too, make sure they're fed, fix em when they're sick. Can she do that? \nBetty hears this, turns to the crying children and softly says -- \nBETTY (ARABIC) Quiet now. \n-- and instantly their crying stops. \nSAM Tell her she's hired. \nINT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANGE - NIGHT \nWe see Betty and another Camp Woman (ROSE) moving through this room carrying lanterns, helping the children get ready for sleep -- \nBETTY (ARABIC) You two share a blanket and tomorrow we will find another. \nROSE (ARABIC) Shhhh, it's time to shut your eyes... \nAnd we see Sam here too, doing what he can, tucking in a few of the kids, starting to make a connection with these children. \nEXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT \nAnd we see a handful of SPLA soldiers stationed around the perimeter of the compound, standing guard. Sam and Deng sitting next to a lantern by the front gate. \nSAM You know what's funny? In English your name means \"darn it.\" \nDENG What is this `darn it?' \nSAM Deng. It means `shucks.' You know, like you stub your toe and you go \"ahhhhh, deng!\" Get it? \nDENG (DEAD SERIOUS) This is not funny. In my language, in Arabic, names are very important. They tell you everything about a man. (BECOMING HEATED) Your name proceeds you wherever you go. You are Sam. This is how you are known. In my language this means something. \nSam feeling terrible, realizes he's offended him. \nSAM I'm sorry, buddy. It was just a joke. \nQuiet, awkward, just the two of them sitting here quietly for a long beat. Finally... \nSAM (CONT'D) What does Sam mean in Arabic? \nDENG Small penis. \nAnd Deng smiles brightly. Sam realizing he's been played. And Deng starts to LAUGH. A deep, guttural, infectious laugh. Sam joining him, and we sense that at this moment these two have become friends. And gradually their laughter subsides, and it's quiet again. \nSAM Can I ask you a question? \nDENG Of course. \nSAM You believe in God? \nDeng considering this for a beat, and then... \nDENG I was raised to believe there was a God in heaven. (MORE) DENG (CONT'D) But it is impossible to live here, to see what I have seen, and not turn your back on him. \nBEAT. \nSAM Maybe you'll invite him in again one day. \nBetty and the other Camp woman herding the terrified children into this building -- the only brick structure on the compound -- and then Deng, Marco, A.J. and the other SPLA soldiers coming in -- moving to the window holes and returning fire -- \nEXT. FRONT GATE - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - NIGHT \nSam sweeping the AK back and forth, trying to hold off the rebels as long as he can -- and then -- \nKABOOOM!! \nMore of the fence eviscerated by a grenade blast. \nREBELS ADVANCING ON THE ORPHANAGE -- BREACHING THE PERIMETER -- \nSam becoming overwhelmed in the fight -- firing as he retreats back into the compound -- \nINT. CHAPEL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT \n-- Sam storming into the chapel -- turning to Betty -- \nSAM (meaning the children) Put em in the middle! \nBetty and the other woman do exactly that -- they move the children into a tight group in the center of the room. \nBETTY (ARABIC) Down here! -- in the center! -- all of you! -- stay down! \nEXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT \nRebels moving through the compound, firing into tukuls and setting everything on fire. \nINT.

CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT \nRebels swarming around the chapel, but reaching a point where they can't advance any further -- \n-- and we see a rebel squat behind a shed and screw an RPG into a launcher -- he pops up -- levels the launcher at the chapel and -- \nKrakakakakak! \nHe's cut down before he's able to fire -- \nINT. CHAPEL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT \n-- Sam sweeping his AK across the compound -- the other soldiers burning through magazines and reloading -- rebels firing back -- Betty and the children crowded on the floor in the middle of this STORM OF GUNFIRE -- and we stay in this little chapel -- watching this last stand -- until we -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - MORNING \nAnd we see the entire orphanage has been razed to the ground. Betty and a few of the children picking through the burned out buildings and torched tukuls, looking for anything salvageable. Deng, Nineteen, and some of the SPLA soldiers loading the corpses of rebels into the back of the truck... \n... and now we find Sam staring at the brick chapel in the middle of the compound. The only structure that remains. Everything else -- his entire dream -- in ashes. \nINT. GROCERY STORE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT \nAnd we see Lynn pushing a shopping cart down the aisle, past shelves loaded with packaged produce. And we hear BUZZING. Lynn digging the cell phone out of her purse -- \nLYNN Hello? \nEXT. STREET CAFE - NIMULE, SUDAN - SAME (DAY) \nAnd we find Sam sitting at a table along this dusty, crowded street. His duffelbag on the ground next to him. \nSAM (INTO PHONE) It's me. \nINT. GROCERY STORE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT \nLynn immediately senses something wrong. \nLYNN You ok? \nEXT. STREET CAFE - NIMULE, SUDAN - SAME (DAY) \nAnd we see that he's not. This man is empty, alone, defeated. \nSAM They burned it to the ground. All of it. Ain't nuthin left. \nINT. GROCERY STORE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT \nShe hears the anguish in his voice. \nLYNN Where are you? \nEXT. STREET CAFE - NIMULE, SUDAN - DAY \nSAM Nimule... \nINT. GROCERY STORE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT \nSAM'S VOICE (O.S.) ... I'm comin home. \n-- DOORS BANGING OPEN! -- CONTROLLED CHAOS as the children are hauled into this clinic -- Betty taking care of Alice -- the worst off -- hooking her up to an IV as Sam moves to her bedside -- the little girl still mumbling quietly -- \nSAM What is she saying? \nBETTY She is asking what she did wrong? \nSam taking Alice's hand in his... very slowly her beautiful eyes open and she sees him... and says something in Arabic... \nBETTY (CONT'D) (TRANSLATING) She is asking if you are `The Preacher.' \nSAM (NODDING) Tell her she's gonna be ok. \nBetty translates and Alice smiles faintly... and now one of the other camp women comes over and Sam steps back so they can work... \nEXT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DUSK \nSam coming out of the infirmary and finding Deng here with a few of the SPLA soldiers who brought the children. \nSAM Where did they find em? \nDENG Their village was hit out Adjumani. \nOff Sam, hearing this, we... \nTIME DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DAWN \nAnd we see Sam and Deng sitting outside the infirmary, exhausted, been here all night waiting. And now the door opens and Betty comes out. She looks down at them and simply shakes her head... \nAnd we know Alice is dead. \nAnd it looks like a grenade has gone off inside Sam. And suddenly he grabs an AK and gets up, seething, walks off... \nDENG Sam... \nEXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - DAY \n... Sam walking fast through the compound... Deng following... \nDENG Where are you going? \nSAM Adjumani. \nDENG Sam, please wait... \nSAM I ain't waitin. You wanna see what waitin gets ya?

SUV - DRIVING - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY \nBombing down this rutted, red dirt road. The engine at full tilt. Sam, Deng, Nineteen, Marco, and A.J. jammed into this truck riding in dead silence... AK47's bouncing between their knees... only the sound of the WAR SONG playing as we watch these men... a grave stillness on their faces... thinking of what men do just before their own death. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY \nWe see two LRA VEHICLES approaching in the distance... a LEAD JEEP and a PICKUP TRUCK behind it... \nINT. LRA PICKUP TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY \nFour CHILD SOLDIERS squatting in the flatbed of this truck carrying AK47's. We recognize one of the boys as the younger brother from the opening scene -- WILLIAM. \nINT. LRA JEEP - DRIVING - DAY \nWith two ADULT REBELS in this Jeep as they drive down this road past bombed-out vehicles... and in the distance we see the smoldering wreckage of a transport truck on the side of the road... the thick smoke hanging over the road like a black curtain... blocking out vision of the road ahead... \n... and the Jeep punches into the black smoke followed by the pickup truck... and we're lost in the swirling haze for a moment before coming out the other side... and this is what we see -- \nSAM -- standing in the middle of the road ahead of us shouldering a RPG -- the ADULT REBELS see him just as -- \nWHOOOOSH! -- an RPG streaks right at us and DETONATES -- KABOOOOM! -- and the Jeep flips onto it's side -- \nINT.

LRA TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY \nWilliam and the other child soldiers here with two ADULT REBELS -- crouched behind the truck for cover -- the ADULT REBELS returning fire, but the children aren't moving, scared shitless. \nWilliam peers around the truck and sees Sam fifty yards away, turns to the boys next to him... \nDOOR BELL RINGING -- and we see a perky woman in her late 40's coming through the crowd, blonde hair from a bottle, accessorized to the hilt, holding a glass of white wine. SHANNON WALLACE. She opens the door to find Sam, Lynn, and Paige standing in the doorway. \nSHANNON Well, come on in... \nAnd they enter... Lynn smiling awkwardly, dressed in the same yellow dress we saw her in previously... her only dress... and Sam looking around this enormous room... \nSHANNON (CONT'D) Ya'll must be the Childers. Welcome. I'm Shannon, Bill's ball-n-chain. \nSmiling, a joke she loves... \nLYNN I'm Lynn, this here is Sam, our daughter Paige. \nSHANNON Good to meet you. \nVOICE (O.S.) There he is! \nEverybody turning to see the car dealer coming through the crowd, smiling, a little drunk. AD-LIBBED introductions and then... \nBILL Glad ya'll could make it. Get on in here and meet some people... \nBill ushering them deeper into the house... quick intros to a few guests as they pass... Sam, Lynn, and Paige taking it all in... starting to sense the dimensions of this massive house... the waiters in their pressed jackets offering them food... the extravagance... like nothing they've ever seen... \n... Bill pulling Sam off from the crowd so it's just the two of them... taking an envelope from his jacket and handing it to him... \nBILL (CONT'D) This is a little somethin for the kids, ok? What we were talking about. \nSAM Thank you, Bill. \nBILL Forget it. Now c'mon, can I get ya a mojito or somethin? \nINT. BATHROOM - SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY \nSam coming into this bathroom and locking the door... taking the envelope out of his pocket and tearing it open... pulling out a personal check -- CLOSE UP to see it's in the amount of $150 \nHOLD ON Sam face, and it's disgust we see in his eyes. \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY \nFront door opening fast and Lynn and Paige coming out, followed by Sam, pushing them along... \nLYNN Sam... \nPAIGE Why we leavin so soon? \nShannon appearing in the doorway in the b.g., calling after... \nSHANNON Everything alright?... \nLynn turning to respond, but Sam keeps her moving forward, down the driveway, past the line of parked BMW's and Mercedes to their truck at the curb... \nSAM Get in the car. \nLYNN What's wrong? \nAs they load into the truck... \nSAM Sonuvabitch is cryin pour-mouth to me and he's livin in the damn Taj Mahal... \nLYNN Sam... \nSAM I asked him for five-thousand dollars to feed a buncha motherless babies and you know what he gave me?

CHILDERS HOUSE - DAY \n-- Sam coming into the house, enraged, followed by Lynn. He moves to his gun cabinet, grabs a hidden key, unlocks it... \nLYNN What are you doin? \nSAM I've had it with these people and all their bullshit about wantin to help... \nAnd he starts pulling out weapons... shotguns and assault rifles... stuffing them into an oversize gun bag... \nLYNN Sam Childers... \nLynn reaching for him and he grabs her wrist... tightly... staring at her with dark eyes. A flash of the \"old\" Sam Childers here when he says... \nSAM Stay outta my way. \nAnd for the first time in years this woman is scared. He lets go of her wrist and continues to fill the bag -- and we go -- \nEXT. PAWN SHOP - JOHNSTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA - DAY \nSam coming out followed by the Shop Owner... \nSHOP OWNER ... I'm sorry, twenty-five hundred is the best I can do for them gun. \nREVERSE to see Lynn's car parked at the curb, Sam pointing to it... \nSAM Throw in the car for five. \nThe Shop Owner considering, as we go... \nEXT.

CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY \nDONNIE Ok. \nPAIGE Dad usually kisses me on the forehead before he leaves. You can do that. \nDONNIE Sure I can. \nAnd Donnie does just that, bends down and kisses Paige on the head... \nDONNIE (CONT'D) Sweet dreams. \nAnd now we see Lynn in the hallway having just witnessed this through the cracked door, keenly feeling Sam absence in this moment. \nEXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY \nAnd we see Sam, Betty and Rose leading a group of children, their hands covering their eyes so they can't see, into a clearing behind one of the dorms. \nSAM Keep em closed! A little bit more! \nBETTY (ARABIC) Keep your eyes closed. \nROSE (stern, Arabic) Michael! Cover your eyes! No peeking! \nSAM ... keep comin'... \nThe children inching forward, following his voice, until... \nSAM (CONT'D) Ok, stop! Open your eyes! \nBETTY (ARABIC) Open your eyes! \nAnd we see a hundred little eyes popping open, staring at something off screen, confused for a split second at what they're looking at. \nREVERSE to see a PLAYGROUND: two or three battered swingsets, a few see-saws, and a jungle gym soldered out of metal pipe. \nAnd the kids SPRINTING for it, climbing all over the jungle gym like ants... hitting the swing-sets... and then we hear it... something we realize we haven't heard in this place before... the sound of laughter... children losing themselves in play. Innocence flooding back. \nAnd now we see Nineteen, A.J. and two other SPLA soldiers standing around a BUNNY BOUNCER... staring at it quizzically... talking in Arabic, trying to decide what this thing is... and then A.J., the bravest, slings his AK onto his back and carefully straddles the bouncer... pulling up his long legs and resting his feet on the pegs... \nAnd he begins to bob back and forth... holding onto the bunny's ears with his big hands... the other soldiers starting to laugh as he bobs faster... and then we see A.J's smile... a million watt smile on this guy... the first time he's played like this since he was a boy. \nEXT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY - LATER \nHours later and we see Sam pushing a couple of the smaller children on the swingset. Deng approaches... \nDENG Some of the child soldiers say there is a bounty on your life. That Kony is offering money for your nose and ears. \nSam, no reaction, just keeps swinging the children... \nDENG (CONT'D) I'd like to assign a few more men to you during the day. \nSAM He ain't the first old-boy who wanted to see my head hanging on his wall. Keep yer soldiers where they're needed. I can take care of myself. \nDeng clearly worried for his friend, but doesn't press the issue. And now Sam notices William off from the group, sitting on the ground by himself, not playing. \nSAM (CONT'D) He said anything yet? \nDENG All we know is that his family was killed and that he and his brother were taken into the LRA. \nSAM Where's the brother? \nDENG Nobody knows. \nNEW ANGLE \nSam approaching William, kneeling down next to him. \nSAM Hey buddy, you don't wanna play with the other kids? \nWilliam, no response. \nSAM (CONT'D) You know sometimes it helps to tell somebody what you got locked up inside, know what I mean? \nWilliam, no reaction whatsoever. Something dawning on Sam in this moment... \nSAM (CONT'D) You have no idea what I'm sayin, do you? \nWilliam just stares back at him and Sam realizes he doesn't speak English. And they both just sit here for a moment, silent, staring at the children playing on the playground. And then Sam, feeling the need to unburden himself, begins to talk... \nSAM (CONT'D) I done a lotta things I ain't proud of. Hurt a lotta people. Truth is, helpin you kids is about the only good thing I ever done in this life. \nWilliam watching him quietly. \nSAM (CONT'D) But I'm scared. Scared one day I'll close my eyes to all this and make it somebody else's problem. (BEAT) Just like everybody else in this world. \nAnd he stops and it's silent between them again. William just sitting there quietly. And Sam looks up to the sky... feeling his life washing over him... his burden... this fear. \nINT. SUV - DRIVING - DAY \nSam behind the wheel, driving alone the edge of a dry ravine. Deng is in the passenger seat and we see Nineteen, Marco and A.J. crammed into the back. \nSAM I don't see nuthin. \nDeng checking a handheld GPS unit -- \nDENG This is it. \nSam looking out the window, sees movement at the bottom of the ravine. \nSAM Hold on... \nDeng looking through binocs at the ridge -- \nDENG (calling out to Sam) I think you got him! \nEXT. RIVERBED - DAY \nSam, Deng, and Marco moving toward the children, weapons drawn, scanning the area in all directions. Deng is the first one to reach the boys who are huddled on the ground, shaking from fear... \nDENG (ARABIC) It is ok. You can get up now. \nBut the boys don't move... and Deng reaches down, pulls them to their feet and we see that their ankles are chained to a post which has been buried in the ground. \nDENG (CONT'D) Sam. \nSam joins Deng, sees the chains. \nDENG (CONT'D) LRA wanted us here. \nSam realizing that these children were used as bait -- for him. \nEXT. RAVINE RIDGE - DAY \nWe're at the top of the ravine now and we see Sam and the others moving toward the location of the SNIPER... \n... and Sam is the first to reach the body... laying on the ground face down... a pool of blood soaking the dirt underneath... and he rolls the body onto it's back and we see it's just a kid -- no older than 15 years old. \nINT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT \nIt's late at night and we see Sam on his cot, sitting here in the dark. And we hear the sound of his satellite phone vibrating on the table next to him. He picks it up, sees DONNIE'S name on the screen... \nSAM (INTO PHONE) Hello? \nINT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - PENNSYLVANIA - DAY \nAnd we see Donnie on a couch by himself in this shitty little room. \nDONNIE Sam, it's me. \nINTERCUT THE CONVERSATION: \nSAM Everybody ok? \nDONNIE Oh yeah, everybody's just fine. I was just callin to say `hey' is all. \nSAM How're the girls? \nDONNIE They're good. Paige cooked us all dinner the other night. Chocolate-chip pancakes. \nSAM By herself, huh? \nDONNIE Yep. I helped her with the stove is all. She did everything else. Pretty good too. \nAnd now we see Donnie's DOPE WORKS sitting on the table in front of him. He's using again. \nDONNIE (CONT'D) How's it goin over there? \nSAM Goin fine. \nDONNIE Hey, maybe I'll come with you one of these trips. I'd like to get outta here for a spell. See what it's like. \nSAM Sounds good. \nAnd it's silent between them... both of these men lost in their own worries for a moment... and then... \nDONNIE Ask you a question? \nSAM'S VOICE Yeah. \nDONNIE'S VOICE You think God will forgive us for the things we've done? \nAnd we're watching Sam, this question hitting him like a freight train. Unable to answer. \nEXT. NIMULE - SUDAN, AFRICA - DAY - DAYS LATER \nWe're hit by a crush of people, a thousand black faces moving past us and all the noise and confusion of this busy border town. And we find Sam, Deng, and Nineteen here loading supplies into the back of the SUV. \nVOICE (O.S.) They talk about you... \nSam turning to find Agnete, the aid worker, approaching him. \nAGNETE In the camps. The children. They say there is a white preacher who hunts the LRA. This place does not need more killing, Mr. Childers. \nSAM I'm just tryin to help these people. Same as you. \nAGNETE War upon war does not fix what is broken here. The history of this country is filled with righteous killers. That is how it always begins, with men thinking they are killing for the right reasons. \nSAM I got a 200 kids who are gonna sleep safe tonight and wake up tomorrow mornin to a bowl of hot food. Right or not, that's all the reason I need. \nAGNETE And what about the rumors I have heard about you supplying weapons to the SPLA? \nSam turning to her, face-to-face, starting to get pissed... \nSAM You fight the evil in this place your way, I'll fight it mine. \nAGNETE Do not delude yourself, Mr. Childers. You're a mercenary, not a humanitarian. \nSam, finished with this conversation, slams the lift-gate closed on the truck and starts to climb in... \nAGNETE (CONT'D) They say you are doing good. That you have special powers. That you are protected by angels and cannot be killed by bullets. \nDENG (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nSAM We're takin the ones that ain't gonna make it through the night. Come back for the others later. \nAnd Sam moves to the first child in the group -- a little girl -- reaching out to her but she pulls back. \nSAM (CONT'D) Tell her I'm not gonna hurt her. \nDENG (ARABIC) It's ok... he will not hurt you... \nAnd slowly the little girl steps forward... and Sam gently unbuttons her shirt and begins to examine her little body... turning her around in the harsh light of the SUV's headlamps... and he finds five infected gashes on her back... whip wounds... already turning gangrene... and he gently pushes her toward Deng... \nSAM Put her in the truck. \nAnd Sam continues with the group... assessing each child's health... tenderly running his hands over their broken, starved bodies... somehow calculating which ones are worse off and pulling them out of line... \n... and he reaches the last child and we see that the SUV is now PACKED with children... huddled into every available corner... 10 children in total. There's no more room. \nSAM (CONT'D) Tell em we're comin back. \nDeng hesitating, knows the reaction he's going to get... \nSAM (CONT'D) Tell em! \nDENG (ARABIC) We will be back for you! \nThe children become hysterical, crying, running at Sam and grabbing for him, begging to be taken. \nSAM Let's go! (to the children, holding up TWO FINGERS) Two hours... I'll be back in two hours... \nSam, Deng, and the others loading into the SUV... some of them climbing onto the roof... the only available space... the remaining children clamoring around the truck as it begins to pull away... \nSAM (CONT'D) Tell em to hide. Don't come out til they see my face... \nDeng yelling this to the children as they drive off... \nDENG (ARABIC) Hide until we return! \n... the faint cries of the children slowly fading as they speed into the darkness. \nEXT.

It's ONE HOUR LATER and we see the SUV blasting through the front gate of the compound and skidding to a stop -- DOORS POPPING OPEN -- SOLDIERS JUMPING OFF THE ROOF -- Betty and the other camp women already pulling the children out of the truck... ushering them into the infirmary... \nSam yelling at another soldier as he walks across the courtyard -- \nSAM Gas it up! We're leavin here in five! \nINT. TRUCK - DRIVING - MORNING \nTwo hours into this return trip and it's silent in this cab. Deng checking a handheld GPS, clocking their position, and then they see it -- through the windshield -- in the distance -- \nSMOKE \nRising in a thin column a half-mile away. \nEXT. ROAD - DEEP IN SUDAN - DAY \nThe scene of the ambush the night before. Burned out pickup trucks and dead LRA rebels strewn in the dirt. Sam's SUV arriving and he's the first one out... whistling for the children but they're nowhere to be seen. \nAnd now we realize that the column of smoke isn't coming from the bombed-out LRA trucks -- it's coming from behind them. Sam moving around the back of the TRANSPORT TRUCK to see -- \nTHIRTEEN LITTLE BODIES STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER \nThe children Sam left behind. \nBurned alive by the LRA an hour earlier. \nSam just standing here, staring at this smoldering pile of children. Starting to go someplace very dark. And as he puts it, most of him died in the bush this morning too. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - NIGHT - (JUNE/2005) \nAnd we see a line of American TRAVELERS waiting to be checked through customs... BUSINESS MEN in their rumpled suits carrying briefcases, PARENTS with their tired children returning from vacation... and Sam standing in this line with his duffel bag, somehow cut-off from the life all around him. And the CUSTOMS OFFICER waves him forward... Sam handing him his passport... \nCUSTOMS OFFICER Sudan? \nAnd he looks up, studies Sam -- \nCUSTOMS OFFICER (CONT'D) What are you doing over there? \nAnd we see Sam has no answer for him. This question beginning to plague him like a festering sore. \nEXT. PASSENGER PICK-UP - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - NIGHT \nIt's raining and we see Sam sitting on a bench waiting, staring o.s. at a SKYCAB TROLLEY. Two men working through a pile of BLACK GOLF BAGS, heaped on top of each other like bodies, tossing them one-by- one into the back of the trolley... \nVOICE (O.S.) Sam! \nHe looking up as Donnie gets out of his car, smiling. \nDONNIE Sorry I'm late. Sixteen was all jammed up... \nDonnie is strung out, but Sam is too deep in his own shit to see it. \nDONNIE (CONT'D) Welcome home, buddy. \nINT. OFFICE - BANK - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY \nEXT.

Nobody moving. Completely still. And then... \nLYNN We're just talkin bout it, honey... \nSAM Too much talk in this house. I got mouths to feed and you're talkin bout pissing money away on a limo. \nPAIGE It's my formal, dad. \nSAM I don't give a shit what it is! You ain't gettin no limo, end of story. \nTears welling up in Paige's eyes, anger, hurt, wanting to lash out at him somehow. And what she says next she's felt her whole life... \nPAIGE You love them black babies more than you love me. \nSAM WATCH YER MOUTH LITTLE GIRL, BEFORE I SLAP IT! \nLYNN Sam... \nDonnie instinctively grabbing his arm, protective... \nDONNIE Hey... \nAnd Sam spins -- gets in his face -- eyes dark and threatening -- \nSAM What the hell you think you're doin, boy? \nDONNIE'S CORPSE lying in a casket... \nPacked with mourners. And we hear a CHILDREN'S CHOIR singing a plaintive hymnal... \"My Jesus, I love thee\"... and Donnie's mother in the first pew, dressed in black, surrounded by a few other women offering her comfort. \nAnd now we see Sam moving up the steps to the platform... and the choir softly finishes... and he looks out over the congregation... not saying a word for a long beat... and then... \nSAM Most of you want me to stand up here and make some sense outta this. That's why you come here today. You want me to tell you that God has his plan for all of us, and when he wants to call us back home he's gonna do it. (BEAT) That's what you wanna hear... (QUIETLY) That's what you wanna hear... \nAnd Sam stops, unable to continue... just stares out at the congregation... at the expectant faces looking back at him, waiting... \n... but he steps away from the lectern, down the steps, and walks up the aisle toward the exit... the congregation staring at him as he passes... \nINT. LYNN'S CAR #2/CHILDERS DRIVEWAY - DRIVING - DAY \nHours later. Lynn and Paige still dressed from the funeral, driving up the driveway to their house. \nPAIGE Mom, who are those men? \nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see a FLATBED TRUCK parked next to the house and 7 or 8 MOVERS pulling heavy machinery out of the barn. \nEXT. GARAGE - CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY \nLynn getting out of the car, approaching some of the men... \nLYNN S'cuse me, what are you doing? \nMOVER Loadin up... \nAnd she makes her way into... \nINT. GARAGE - CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY \nFilled with movers busily hauling equipment out of the garage.

What are these men doin here?... \nSam slamming the cabinet closed, moving past her without saying a word. Lynn grabbing his arm, stopping him. \nLYNN (CONT'D) Where are they taking our stuff? \nSAM Ain't ours no more. Best go through and make sure they ain't takin nuthin that belongs in the house. \nHe walks off... \nLYNN Sam... \nAnd she sees two men start to dismantle the \"Childers Construction Company\" sign that she painted herself years ago -- \nLYNN (CONT'D) Hey! -- Don't touch that! -- \nEXT. GARAGE - CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY \nSam moving toward the house. Lynn comes out of the barn after him... \nLYNN (CALLING AFTER) Sam! \nBut he's not stopping.

I know you're angry, but we need to talk about this... \nSAM It's all done, so save yer breath... where's the keys to the safe? \nSam grabs papers from the counter and hands them to Lynn. She quickly pages through them, can't believe what she's reading. \nLYNN You sold the business for $27,000? \nSAM I need a new truck for the orphanage. \nLYNN A new truck? You sold our business for a new truck? \nSam finds the Keys. \nLYNN (CONT'D) That was our future, Sam. Paige's future. \nLynn follows Sam into the office. \nLYNN (CONT'D) Everything we have has gone to those children, Sam. There's a point when there ain't no more to give. \nSAM What's the combination? What's the fucking combination. \nLYNN Paige's birthday. \nSam starts to spin the combination but hesitates... \nLYNN (CONT'D) You don't know it, do you? You don't even remember your own daughter's birthday. \nSAM What are the numbers? \nLYNN You fight for everyone but us. \nShe moves past him, spinning the combination and cranking open the vault. Sam grabbing a couple stacks of cash. \nBOOOOM! \nHe's dead. Just like that. And he continues walking up the bridge. And we see Agnete, Deng and the other soldiers having just witnessed this. \nINT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT \nWilliam coming in quietly, moving next to one of the captured Rebels from the previous scene who is shackled to a bed, injured. Two SPLA soldiers here standing guard. \nWILLIAM (ARABIC) I want to ask you something... \nWilliam pulls out the photograph of his brother, holds it up... \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) This is my brother. His name is Christopher. He was stolen by the rebels. (BEAT) Do you know if he is alive? \nThe Rebel looks at the photograph but says nothing, just shakes his head... and he looks off, his thousand yard stare inscrutable... \nAnd William simply folds the photograph back up and slips it into his pocket... but he doesn't leave... he sits here a moment longer... quietly... thinking... and then... \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) Were you taken when you were young like me? \nThe Rebel hears this and turns to him... and nods his head... \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) Do you remember your parents? \nAnd we see something happening in this hardened rebel... his eyes filling with a distant memory... a sadness... and slowly he nods his head again. \nAnd we stay here with these two lost souls sitting next to each other... silent... connected by a shared history and anguish. \nEXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY - LATER \nSam sitting alone, lost to the world around him. Deng approaches. Neither one acknowledging the other for a long beat until... \nDENG Do you hear that, Preacher? \nSAM What? \nDENG There is no more laughter. The children do not play here anymore. They are scared once again. (BEAT) But now they are scared of you. \nSam, no response. \nDENG (CONT'D) The men do not trust you any longer to lead them into battle. They say you have a wish to die. (BEAT) I am worried about my friend. I want to help him. \nSAM I don't need your help. \nAnd Sam turns away. After a beat Deng walks off, leaving him alone once again. \nINT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT \nAnd we see Sam here in the dark... moonlight filtering in through the thatched roof... like shards of glass cutting through the blackness... and he doesn't look right here... soul worn thin... eyes hollow... starting to go someplace very bad... \n... IMAGES FLASHING IN HIS HEAD... babies burned and screaming... Donnie in his coffin... and we realize we're watching something here... his world starting to cave in on him... \n... and he drops against his cot... distraught... tears in his eyes and this man is breaking... and suddenly we see a gun in his hand... finger curling around the trigger as he puts it to his head... eyes closing against the world... and... \nWE HEAR A KNOCK AT HIS DOOR \nSam frozen... still holding the gun... and slowly the door pushes open and we hear soft footsteps shuffling into this dark room... \n... and William steps into the light, sees Sam here on the ground with the gun in his hand... and slowly he moves next to him, sitting on the cot without saying a word... just the two of them here for a moment... and then slowly he begins in perfect English... \nWILLIAM I remember my parents when I sleep. I see them in my dreams sometimes. \nSam looking to William... this small boy sitting above him... telling his story... \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) My father was big like you. They shot him. We were so scared. Then the rebels gave me a club and told me if I didn't kill my mother they would shoot my brother and me. \nAnd William pauses in his story... lost in this memory... his face becoming a mask of pain... but no tears... there are no more tears in this young man left to be shed... and so he continues... \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) I refused, but my mother told me to swing hard... that I must make her proud... (BEAT) And so I did. I made her proud. \nAnd now William looks down at Sam... staring at this man on the ground... and he reaches out and gently touches Sam's head... a moment of tenderness for both of them... an act of love.... these two broken souls finding each another here... and William says... \nWILLIAM (CONT'D) If we allow ourselves to become full of hate then they've won. We must not let them take our hearts. This is the most important thing. \nAnd Sam sets the gun down and reaches out to William, pulls him into an embrace... holding him close... and we know that without a doubt this boy has saved this man's life. \nINT. CHILDERS' HOUSE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY- CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT \nSoft Christian music is playing on the radio. Lynn folding clothes in the laundry room when the phone rings.

LRA CAMP - DEEP IN THE BUSH - NIGHT \nWilliam shoved through the bush... moving deeper into this rebel encampment... dark and otherworldly... figures moving around camp fires... laughing... men with little girls... their child wives... with pregnant bellies... and incongruously the sound of American rap music coming from a jambox somewhere. \nThe overriding sense we get from this place is one of `insanity.' \nAnd William is dragged to a clearing next to a grouping of tents and he's kicked to the dirt... two other soldiers pinning him to the ground as a third grabs his feet and pulls off his shoes... William YELLING and now a handful of other LRA soldiers start to gather around... most of them only a few years older than him... watching as his ankles are bound together and placed on a wooden block... \n... and now another soldier steps forward with an AXE... and the crowd whips into bloodlust... shouting... cheering... \nAND THE SOLDIER LIFTS THE AXE INTO THE AIR -- \nWILLIAM WRITHING ON THE GROUND BUT CAN'T GET FREE -- \nAND THE SOLDIER STARTS TO BRING THE BLADE DOWN -- AND -- \nVOICE (O.S.) (ARABIC) Stop! \nThe soldier freezes -- everyone turning as an LRA COMMANDER comes through the crowd -- takes the axe from the soldier -- \nSOLDIER He ran from us. \nCOMMANDER He is worth nothing with no feet.

SUV - DAWN \nBoth SUV's parked off the side of the road now. Sam and Deng here, looking at maps and the GPS tracker. And we hear Deng's radio squawk.

They were headed for Ed Duim. \nINT./EXT. - LRA CONVOY/BUSH - DEEP IN SUDAN - DAY \nA convoy of 4 or 5 LRA trucks barreling down this dirt track.

CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT \nIt's late and we see Lynn sitting at the kitchen table alone. Sam has not come home and she is clearly worried. And then we hear a car pulling up outside, door opening and closing, and Sam coming into the trailer. \nSAM Sorry I'm late. \nLynn staring at him, trying to read this man's face but he's not looking at her. Avoiding her gaze. Did he use? Is he high? And then she sees a PINPRICK OF DRIED BLOOD on his shirtsleeve. Her face contorting almost imperceptibly. Her worst fear realized. Relapse. \nAnd she moves to him without saying a word... lifts up his arm and unbuttons the cuff of his shirt... slowly pushing up his shirtsleeve to discover a NEEDLE PRICK in his arm... \n... and then he pulls out a $20 bill and hands it to her. \nSAM (CONT'D) Gave blood over in Pitt. \nLynn searching his eyes and she knows he's telling the truth. \nSAM (CONT'D) That's all I got. \nAnd she pulls him close, hugging him tight, grateful. \nLYNN Somethin will come through.

SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH/KITCHEN - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY \nAnd we see two teens moving toward the sound of a crowd coming from inside the church, responsive, \"Hallelujah!\"... and then Sam's voice over it all... \nSAM (O.S.) In your actions you give service to the Lord... \nINT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - CENTRAL CITY - SAME \nSam at the pulpit in mid-sermon. There is an air of Fire and Brimstone to what we're watching here... electric... the congregation listening in rapt attention... \nSAM ... he's not interested in your good thoughts... your good intentions... he wants your hands... your backs... your sweat... your blood to pour into the foundation that will build up his kingdom! \nAd-libbed SHOUTS and PRAISE... and now we see Lynn, Daisy, Donnie and Paige in the congregation listening... as we go -- \nINT. HALLWAY/FOYER - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY \nLynn and Sam walking through the facility, and we see this place is alive with activity. More than just a church, this is a community center. Lynn opening a door and we see a Volunteer here with a dozen little children running around this playroom... \nLYNN We started daycare last month. Monday thru Friday from 8 to 2... Sundays after first worship for a few hours if anybody needs it. How you doin, Sue? \nVOLUNTEER Good. Hey Pastor. \nSAM Sue. \nLynn pulling the door closed and they continue... moving down a set of stairs to the basement where we see children and parents... some of them playing ping-pong and air hockey... others in a corner rehearsing for a Christmas play... \nSAM (CONT'D) Been thinkin we need to put up a playground. Swings. Some things the kids can climb on. \nLYNN We can't build anymore. Not for awhile. \nSAM You said Sundays has been full. \nLYNN Turn outs been good, but that don't mean people is givin money.

And they can play at the school on weekends if they want \nSam turning to her -- \nSAM Not talking bout here. Talkin about the orphange. \nLynn catching up to him now, realizing his head is still back in Africa. \n", "test3_true": "Sam working on his Harley. Donnie entering in the b.g. \nDONNIE What'cha workin on, buddy? \nSAM Trouble with the push rods I think. She's runnin kinda rough. \nDONNIE Shoulda kept that mild in there `stead a buildin up a hot rod. Let's see whatcha got here... \nDonnie moving next to him, working on the bike... \nDONNIE (CONT'D) ... never had these problems when we was runnin solid lifters, huh? \nSAM Used to fix them old shovelheads on the side of the road with a buckknife and a wire hanger. \nDONNIE Remember that year we went to the Freakers Ball? \nSam smiling... \nSAM I think that old `78 broke down five times on that trip. \nDONNIE Sounds about right. Shoot, we had more fun tryin to get there than when we finally did. \nSam and Donnie share a laugh. \nDONNIE (CONT'D) Can I talk to you about somethin? \nSAM Yep. \nDONNIE I'm glad I'm walkin with the Lord and all, but sometimes I ain't sure I'm gonna be able to do what he wants me to do. \nSAM The Lord don't ask for nuthin you can't deliver, buddy. And yer one tough ole boy. \nDONNIE Sometimes I ain't so sure how tough I am. \nAnd we see in Donnie's eyes just how troubled he is. \nSAM Why don't we pray together then... \nAnd they both take a knee, bowing their heads as Sam continues... \nSAM (CONT'D) Our gracious Heavenly Father, bless us with the strength to carry on in your name. And grant us, in our darkest hours, the understandin that you are always by our side. \nAnd we leave these two men, their heads bowed in quiet supplication, next to this Harley, praying for strength. \nINT. SHOWROOM - CAR DEALERSHIP - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY (JULY/2004) \nFour or five gleaming sedans on this showroom floor. And we see Sam sitting across from BILL WALLACE, late 40's, gold Rolex. \nBILL ... from what I heard, you built yourself one helluva church over there in Central City. \nSAM Still got a ways to go, but we're gettin there. You should come on by one of these Sundays, bring the family. \nBILL That's nice of you, but we're at Calvary now. Bit more our speed over there I think. \nSam, getting down to business... \nSAM Reverand Carlton gives a mean sermon, puts me to shame. Anyway Bill, I'm here cause I wanna talk to you about what we're doin over there in Africa. \nBILL Course I know about what you're doin. Helluva thing helpin out those kids, Sam. \nSAM Thank you, but I'm gonna be straight with ya. We're hurtin for money... If we had a little bit more support from people like yourself sure would help things run a lot smoother over there. \nBill feeling the rub, shaking his head... \nBILL Sam, look, everybody is feelin the pinch around here. \nSAM I hear that, but you gotta understand that them kids over there got nuthin. I mean nuthin, Bill, and I'm not asking for much. \nBILL How much you lookin for? \nSAM Five thousand dollars. \nBILL Jesus Christ, Sam! Five thousand dollars? \nSAM That keeps them doors open for another six months. \nBILL People are losin their jobs left and right round here. Tough to be askin for five thousand dollars for a buncha African children half-way around the world. \nSam shifting, not giving up, coming at him another way... \nSAM You're right. We got problems right here. But with that kinda money we could feed them kids, house them kids. \nBill staring at him, saying nothing, on the spot. Sam hoping that somehow he's reached this man. And finally Bill stands up... \nBILL Alright, tell you what, lemme see what I can do. \nSam feeling this victory, flashing a smile, shaking Bill's hand. \nSAM Ok. \nBILL Why don't you and the family come over to the house next Sunday. We're havin a little barbeque, ok? \nSAM Sounds good. \nINT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY \nUpscale French provincial in suburban Johnstown.

The POV backs away and -- static as the tape ends. 
LENNY, IN THE PRESENT, whips off the trodes, freaking.  He feels around his throat with one hand... can't feel anything. 
Crossing quickly to a mirror near the front door, he inspects his neck minutely.  There is a hair-line red line over his carotid.  He looks around the room wildly, his heart hammering.  Slowly, he gets his breathing under control. 
Then... he hears something in the kitchen.  A tiny click. 
His eyes go wide.  Hyperventilating, Lenny moves silently into the bedroom.  He fishes around under the bed and pulls out a GLOCK 22 .45 auto pistol.  He stalks silently toward the kitchen. 
Then he looks at the butt of the pistol-grip: no magazine. He un-stalks back to the bed and finds a loaded magazine under a bunch of dirty socks.  He inserts it quietly, wincing as he chambers a round. 
Heart thudding, he works his way to the kitchen door.  He edges around the frame, pie-ing the room.  Cop reflexes intact. 
Mace is sitting at the kitchen table, giving him a funny look.  She is drinking a cup of coffee, made from the bottle of instant on the counter.  She is dressed casually, in bicycle pants, work boots and oversized nylon jacket over a tank-top. 
MACE Whatup Lenny? 
LENNY (hands shaking) Jesus, Mace! 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT 
A little later.  As Lenny tosses stuff into a folding bag: clothes, a playback deck, a box of .45 hollow points.  He grabs his grimy old Second Chance body armor from the LAPD and stuffs it into his Haliburton.  When Mace sees him do that, she knows things are freaky. 
MACE Where we going? 
LENNY Anywhere. (finger to his lips) We'll talk about it in the car. 
Mace glances around... unnerved by the possibility of audio surveillance. 
LENNY Hand me that box of tapes, will you? 
He's pointing to a shoe box full of "Faith" tapes.  Mace hands them over with obvious distaste.  He throws them in the bag, starts to zip it... 
... then sees his reflection in the bedroom mirror: something's the matter. 
MACE What is it? 
LENNY This tie doesn't go with blue! 
He yanks off the tie and grabs another. 
CUT TO: 
INT./ EXT.  MACE'S LIMO AND STREET - DAY 
Mace and Lenny drive through the streets of LA on the last day of this millennium.  There are cops in body armor and helmets on some street corners, holding automatic rifles. Helicopters orbit endlessly.  And a National Guard tank rumbles down the street.  State of siege.  The car radio is on, with KROQ's poor Man hyping the impending Millennium LA party. 
POOR MAN ... the New Years Eve mega-bash of the century.  Ten square blocks of madness, with live music, fireworks and the actual rich and famous of LA hobnobbing with us peons.  Also yours truly the Poor Man will be there at the KROQ bandshell, giving away "Millennium LA" and "KROQ 2-K" T-shirts by the truckload-- 
Lenny is keyed up and tense.  He keeps looking out the back window. 
MACE Will you relax.  There's nobody back there. 
LENNY Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?! 
MACE You better keep a low profile for a while. 
LENNY No shit.  You got someplace in mind? 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  BACKYARD/MACE'S HOUSE - DAY 
On Zander, face lighting up, giving Lenny a high five. Lenny drops his bag, shakes, does a little silly hand choreography -- a goof on a bro grip -- that makes Zander laugh.  Mace watches this ritual and smiles herself. Zander can call out a part of Lenny that Mace would like to see more of. 
Cecile is there, hanging out with her boyfriend CURTIS, and Curtis' friend VEJ.  These two guys are about 18, dressed in gangsta garb.  They are listening to "The Prophets of Rage" on a CD player, and watch Lenny with a dispassion that flirts with distaste. 
ZANDER What do you got? 
LENNY (pulls a tape out of his pocket) Today I have... 
MACE (seeing the tape) Lenny, have you lost it completely? 
LENNY Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only. (hands tape to Zander) John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful. 
ZANDER Let's play it now! 
LENNY Later.  Your mom'n I are heading right back out. 
Groans of outrage and protestations of unfairness from Cecile, Vej and Curtis follow this bad news.  Cecile even musters the gumption to speak up. 
CECILE Hey, come on, I been baby-sitting a full 24 hours, I have to get ready for the party tonight... 
MACE Cecile. 
Mace frosts her with a look.  You don't mess with Mace.

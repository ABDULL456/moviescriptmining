RAIN pours down as TUXEDO and the BLONDE burst out the door, laughing. He pushes her against a brick wall, they grope each other hungrily, hands inside clothes, getting drenched in the warm downpour. WITH THE ASSASSIN, wearing his HELMET with the VISOR UP, as he approaches the entwined couple. TUXEDO hears him, 
TURNS-- 
TUXEDO Get lost, meatbag. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON the alley's mouth as we hear the BLONDE'S SCREAM. Seconds later she staggers out, clutching her head, and collapses to the pavement. We hear an ENGINE START from the alleyway. THE ASSASSIN emerges on his bike, rides directly over her body unconcerned-- and ROARS into the night. CAMERA PULLS UP to-- 
EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT 
--an AERIAL VIEW of the rain-swept CITY, some futuristic HIGH-RISES amongst the recognizeable landmarks. Also, a great number of SUPER-CELL TOWERS and DISHES, considerably larger than the ones we see today. CAMERA PICKS UP SPEED, moves quickly to a run-down part of the city, tenements and vacant lots. MOVE DOWN and through a third-story window of-- 
INT. ABANDONED PROJECT BUILDING - NIGHT 
A dark, decaying hallway. A MAN and a WOMAN move stealthily up the stairs, LASER-SIGHT GUNS in hand. The man is THOMAS GREER, the woman JENNIFER PETERS. Both are about 30, handsome, athletic. Greer's spent his life in law enforcement. He's smart and able, wants things to make sense-- but as the world changes around him, he feels he's losing the thread. PETERS is junior to Greer, her attitude's professional but rigid, by the book. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: GREER, in the lead, waves PETERS up. They approach a door at the end of the hall. We see now that their windbreakers read "FBI." GREER kicks open the door-- 
INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT 
Lit by CANDLES and KEROSENE LANTERNS, SMOKE HANGS in the room. We glimpse BODIES hanging from the ceiling in CHAINS. GREER and PETERS train their LASERS around the place, disturbed by the scene. A flash of MOVEMENT in a bedroom and a CRASH-- THE PSYCHO who lives here has kicked over a LANTERN, FIRE spills across the floor. We glimpse a surprisingly good- looking guy, grinning maniacally. He dashes across the 
ROOM-- GREER squeezes off a couple of SHOTS. The PSYCHO's too fast, he LEAPS through a cracked WINDOW. 
EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT 
RAIN has let up. The PSYCHO FALLS thirty feet into a pile of soft DIRT and TRASH. He rolls to the bottom, gets to his feet and runs. GREER looks down from the broken window. 
INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT 
PETERS is beating at the FLAMES with a towel, sees Greer is preparing to jump. 
PETERS Let's call for back-up. 
GREER Where'.s the sport in that? 
PETERS 
IT'S PROTOCOL-- GREER SNORTS and-- 
EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT 
--LEAPS, GREER hits the dirt hard and rolls. He reaches the ground and sets off after the PSYCHO at top speed. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: PLAY A FRANTIC FOOT CHASE, both men scramble over chain- link fences, leap over trashed cars. GREER pursues the PSYCHO around a corner, into a passageway between buildings-- --wherethePSYCHO gets the jump on him, SWINGS a length of pipeathis head. Greer ducks fast, the blow catches him inthearm, he drops his gun. The PSYCHO moves to pick uptheweapon, but Greer tackles him against a dumpster. Greer SLAMS the dumpster lid on the man repeatedly. 
GREER You have the right to remain silent-- But the PSYCHO has grabbed something from the trash, manages to SQUIRT BUG SPRAY in Greer's eyes. Greer's blinded temporarily, the PSYCHO squirms away, running from between buildings across a street-- WHAM! He's hit full-on by a SEMI, his body FLIES through the air. He LANDS HARD on cement, but amazingly is still alive. He tries to get up, but-- GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast against the ground. Greer, still wiping at this eyes, points his weapon at the PSYCHO's head. 
GREER (CONT'D) Stay with me asshole-- 
PSYCHO Why would I do that? The PSYCHO grins-- then his head lolls back, eyes empty. 
INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT 
PETERS is by a WOMAN'S BODY on the floor, holding a pocket SCANNER close to her head. This small device resembles an iPhone. There's tape over the woman's eyes and mouth, which Peters peels away as she speaks into a tiny cellphone earpiece. 
PETERS Is this Kathy Welles...? My name is Jennifer Peters, with the FBI's surrogate crime division...

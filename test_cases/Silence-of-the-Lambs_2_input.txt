CHILTON I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her... 
He hands Clarice a small, dog-eared photo. Looking at it, she is stopped in her tracks. This pleases Chilton. 
CHILTON The doctors managed to re-set her jaw, more or less, and save one of her eyes. His pulse never got over eighty-five, even when he ate her tongue. (pauses, he smiles) I keep him in here. 
He turns, pushes a button. A steel door BUZZES slowly open, and BARNEY - a big, impassive orderly - awaits them in an anteroom. On its walls: restraints, mouthpieces, Mace, tranquilizer guns. 
CLARICE (quickly blocking him) Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think? 
CHILTON (annoyed) You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time. 
CLARICE But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company. 
She holds out the photo. A beat. He grabs it, jaw twitching. 
CHILTON When she's finished, bring her out. 
He turns on his heel, goes. Barney smiles reassuringly. 
BARNEY Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't get near the bars? 
CLARICE (shaking his hand) Clarice Starling. Yes, he did. 
BARNEY Okay. Past the others, it's the last cell. Stay to the middle. I put out a chair for you. 
Sensing her tension, he indicates a nearby security monitor. 
BARNEY I'm watching. You'll do fine. 
Clarice nods gratefully. She looks down the long corridor, takes a deep breath, walks into it. He watches her go. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DR. LECTER'S CORRIDOR - DAY 
MOVING SHOT - with Clarice, as her footsteps ECHO. High to her right, surveillance cameras. On her left, cells. Some are padded, with narrow observation slits, others are normal, barred... Shadowy occupants pacing, MUTTERING... Suddenly a dark figure in the next-to-last cell hurtles towards her, his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses. 
DARK FIGURE I c-can sssmell your cunt! 
Clarice flinches momentarily, but then walks on. 
DR. LECTER'S CELL 
is coming slowly INTO VIEW... Behind its barred front wall is a second barrier of stout nylon net... Sparse, bolted- down furniture, many softcover books and papers. On the walls, extraordinarily detailed, skillful drawings, mostly European cityscapes, in charcoal or crayon. 
Clarice stops, at a polite distance from his bars, clears her throat. 
CLARICE Dr. Lecter... My name is Clarice Starling. May I talk with you? 
Dr. Hannibal Lecter is lounging on his bunk, in white pajamas, reading an Italian Vogue. He turns, considers her... A face so long out of the sun, it seems almost leached - except for the glittering eyes, and the wet red mouth. He rises smoothly, crossing to stand before her; the gracious host. His voice is cultured, soft. 
DR. LECTER Good morning. 
CUTTING BETWEEN THEM 
as Clarice comes a measured distance closer. 
CLARICE Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire. 
DR. LECTER "We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect. 
CLARICE I am, yes. 
DR. LECTER May I see your credentials? 
Clarice is surprised, but fishes her ID card from her bag, holds it up for his inspection. He smiles, soothingly. 
DR. LECTER Closer, please... Clo-ser... 
She complies each time, trying to hide her fear. Dr. Lecter's nostrils lift, as he gently, like an animal, tests the air. Then he smiles, glancing at her card. 
DR. LECTER (continuing) That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you? 
CLARICE I'm - still in training at the Academy. 
DR. LECTER Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me? 
CLARICE We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified? 
DR. LECTER Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please. 
She sits in the folding metal desk-chair. He waits politely till she's settled, then sits down himself, faces her happily. 
DR. LECTER Now then. What did Miggs say to you? (she is puzzled) "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say? 
CLARICE He said - "I can smell your cunt." 
DR. LECTER I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you? 
CLARICE (beat) Yes. 
DR. LECTER It's much better than your shoes. 
CLARICE Maybe they'll catch up. 
DR. LECTER I have no doubt of it.

BLAM! A high horn note sounds. 
SMASH CUT: 
CLOSE-UP -- Biscuit, all dolled up and flashing a million- dollar smile. She begins to sing. 
BISCUIT A tisket a tasket... 
Biscuit is up on a makeshift platform in the bunkhouse, lipsyncing to Ella Fitzgerald. But its not the depressing bunkhouse anymore, it has transformed into Ray's Boom-Boom Room. PULL OUT SLOWLY as Ray, decked out in a sleek tuxedo steps in front of the CAMERA. He speaks into the CAMERA as he walks... 
RAY That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room. 
GOLDMOUTH (O.S.) Hey, Ray... 
Ray looks to his left, sees Goldmouth in the old bunkhouse. 
GOLDMOUTH Where am I at, man? 
RAY (in nightclub) C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door. 
The CAMERA PANS off Ray to Goldmouth, in a tuxedo, at the front door of the nightclub with two lovely ladies. He waves to himself, sitting on his bunk. Himself waves back, smiling like a kid in a candy store. 
Willie is behind the bar, serving drinks to three gorgeous SKIMMIES. 
WILLIE Hey, Ray, I could get used to this! 
CLOSE ON Cookie sitting a table eating a huge porterhouse. The CAMERA DOLLIES around to find Ray eating with him. 
COOKIE Ray, my man, this steak is like butter! 
RAY Made just for you, Cookie. 
COOKIE How about some steak sauce? 
RAY No problem. Oh, boy! 
Ray motions to a busboy clearing a table. It's Claude. 
RAY How about some Worchestershire sauce! And clean that damn table. 
Claude grimaces. 
CUT TO: 
Willie laughing, Goldmouth laughing, Poker Face in the bunk laughing. 
POKER FACE Hey, Ray, I know you got some gambling! 
CUT TO: 
Ray at a craps table holding a pair of dice. He looks at Poker Face on his bunk. 
RAY C'mon, Poker Face, what's a club without some dice? 
The CAMERA PULLS BACK as Ray throws the dice. A perfect seven. The CAMERA PANS UP to Poker Face in a tux clutching a fistful of cash. 
POKER FACE Lucky seven! My nigger! Let it ride! 
Across the room, Jangle Leg, in a tux, sits at the piano. Radio, also in a tux, beats on the drums. 
JANGLE LEG Sing, girlfriend! 
Biscuit sings the song, smiling lovingly at her man. Everyone is having a great time in Ray's Boom-Boom Room, until... 
Whistles blow. At the front door, Hoppin' Bob appears with FIVE TRUSTIES dressed in police outfits. The incorrigibles scatter. 
RADIO Hey, Ray, looks like trouble! 
A hard white light from Hoppin' Bob's flashlight shines directly into the CAMERA. 
CLOSE ON Ray, in his bed, back in the old bunkhouse. The music stops abruptly. He shields his eyes from the harsh light. Hoppin' Bob is looming over him. It's back to reality. 
HOPPIN' BOB You don't shut up, you're gonna spend the rest of the night in the hole, Gibson! That goes for the rest of you girls, too. I don't want to hear another peep about no Boom-Boom fucking Room! 
A loud burst of flatulence cuts through the darkness. Hoppin' Bob turns his flashlight on Cookie. 
COOKIE Sorry, Cap'n. 
Scowling, Hoppin' Bob steps out of the cage and locks the door behind him. The men slowly settle back in. 
RADIO (whispering) Pretty good story, Ray. Didn't much care for the ending though. 
Lights out at Camp 8. 
EXT. CAMP 8 -- YARD -- DAY

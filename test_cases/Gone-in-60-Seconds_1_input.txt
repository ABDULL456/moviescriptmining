climb back into their car ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF Who is this friggin' guy -- ? 
CLOSE ON - CASTLEBECK. Because he's got a sick feeling who. 
ELEANOR 
takes an exit ... And speeds on through the with everyone in pursuit ... 
POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.) Attention all units. Road block being set up at the eastern terminus of the Long Beach Harbor Tunnel. Use caution. 
EXT. HARBOR TUNNEL EASTERN TERMINUS 
It's quite a road block. A DOZEN SQUAD CARS. A WOODEN BARRICADE ... The whole shebang... 
EXT. TUNNEL - ELEANOR 
eating asphalt ... Coming to the tunnel's mouth ... To the road block ... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on to the roadblock ... And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way -- 
Memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- And yanks the parking brake -- And the mustang spins on the straight --(and yes, this is exactly like our opening) Screeching spin ... It stops inches from the road block ... 
Beat ... Thirty squad cars stop behind him ... 
POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.) All units. Pursuit has been terminated. Repeat: pursuit has been terminated at Harbor Tunnel Eastern Terminus -- 
Sure it has. Memphis' foot SLAMS ON Eleanor's pedal ... SMASHING THROUGH THE ROADBLOCK... Cars and cops flying ... And the Dispatch guy is getting pissed. 
POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.) Check that, all units. You guessed it. Pursuit has not been terminated. Jesus Christ, will you catch this guy? 
EXT. LONG BEACH BRIDGE 
A huge suspension bridge spanning the harbor ... Except that on the Long Beach side, therehas been a terrible ACCIDENT ... An eleven-car PILE UP ... 
PARAMEDIC This is Rescue 2... We're at a scene of an 11-car collision with multiple injuries, responded to Ladder truck Code 3 ... We'll need back-up and The Jaws of Life... 
Paramedics ... RAMP TRUCKS hauling away wrecked cars ... Fire engines ... Bloodied VICTIMS ... 
EXT. CITY STREETS - ELEANOR 
takes it on through the vast construction underway here ... And here's our money shot: Eleanor. On Route 33. COMING AT US ... Followed by, literally, 20 POLICE-CARS ... Could be just about the coolest fucking thing we've ever seen... But before we have time to gloat: 
POLICE DISPATCH (O.S.) All units. Suspect vehicle has left The Harbor Tunnel roadblock... State Police advises they have a multiple T.A. on the Long Beach Bridge... Accident is unrelated to Long Beach P.D. pursuit... Repeat unrelated to Long Beach P.D. pursuit. The area is closed except to emergency vehicles. Suspect is headed in that direction. Use caution in that area. Repeat: use caution in that area ... 
THE LONG BEACH BRIDGE 
Southbound traffic on the bridge (into Long Beach) is at a stand-still because of the accident... The Northbound side of the bridge is EMPTY... Northbound traffic stopped at the accident ... 
Memphis comes to a stop 100 feet before the accident ... There is no way past it, onto the bridge ... All the cops behind him come to a screeching halt. He is truly trapped. 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF 
is thrilled ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF Gotcha now, dickhead -- 
But Castlebeck's not so sure ... He sees a possible play... So does 
MEMPHIS 
Heavy sigh... He shuts off the radio ... And there's a strange SILENCE... As everyone waits ... Watches ... 
QUICK CUTS TO -- 
-- Matty In The Morning -- The gang at Otto's -- The Carpenter in his wood shop -- Helen Raines, in front of her TV -- The chopper cops -- Paramedics, cops, injured motorists, fire men -- Castlebeck and Drycoff... BACK TO 
MEMPHIS RAINES AND ELEANOR... 
Another few beats of silence ... Everyone watching ... He punches the gas... Ripping down to the accident site... Heading straight for it ... And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further injure the accident victims - 
Not our Memphis ... He's heading straight for 
THE RAMP TRUCK 
parked ass-end toward Long Beach ... Ramp down ... Memphis rockets Eleanor at the ramp truck's ramp... Straight on ... And the ramp LAUNCHES ELEANOR in glorious super-sexy-bloodpumping SLO-MO OVER THE ACCIDENT SITE some thirty feet in the air ... Evel-style ... 
DETECTIVE DRYCOFF You gotta be fucking kidding me -- 
Where she lands in a crippling thud... Onto the EMPTY side of the Long Beach Bridge... Cheers from the gang at Otto's ... The gang at KISS-108 ... Memphis pulls her to a stop... Looks back at the scene ... 
Castlebeck squints ... Trying to see if it's his boy... Memphis switches the radio back on ... Matty has obliged... Wilson Pickett's "Mustang Sallyo ... And Memphis drives over the bridge, the only car going northbound... Memphis rides, daddy, rides ... 
INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - FRONT OFFICES - DAY 
A half-dozen Calitri SOLDIERS are here, answering phones, playing cards. 
INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - WORKSHOP 
The sliding door is open. The CASKET for Kip rests to the side ... Calitri uses a router to make a rabbet along the bottom frame of a plywood gossip bench. He senses something and turns to 
THE LOADING DOCK - MEMPHIS 
has driven up in the smashed-to-shit Eleanor ... He climbs up, entering the workshop... Calitri glances to the wallclock: 7:55 AM... 
CALITRI Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ... 
MEMPHIS This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ? 
CALITRI Right there - 
He gestures to a Haliburton case ... Memphis opens it ... There's a lot of cash inside... 
CALITRI (cont'd) 200 K. Just like we said ... 
MEMPHIS You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...

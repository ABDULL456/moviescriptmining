{"train": "OFFICE SPACE \nTranscribed by \nJean Liew \n[Scene: A highway. There's a huge traffic jam. Peter drives forward a bit at a time and he sees an old man with a walker on the sidewalk. The lane next to his is moving, so he switches lanes, only to have it stop and the lane he was on move. He switches back and then it happens again. The old man is now ahead of him.] \nCut to Michael, who's rapping along with the radio. A black guy selling papers walks by and he shuts the windows and turns down the volume. He passes and he turns it back up again. \nCut to Samir. He grabs the steering wheel and shakes it in frustration. \nSAMIR Motherf - shit - sonofa - ass!! I just - \nHe hits the steering wheel. \nCut to Milton at a bus stop. TN \nHe mumbles his coming lines, as he does with all his lines. \nMILTON It's late again. If I'm there late again, I will be dismissed. \n[Scene: Initech parking lot. Bill drives into his special spot. (Reserved for Bill Lumbergh) He turns on the alarm for his Porsche (license plate: MY PRSHE) and walks in. Peter walks in too.] \nCut to inside. Peter pauses at the door and slowly reaches out to touch the metal handle. It gives him a shock and he enters. \nCut to the cubicles. Peter goes into his. He picks up papers, turns on the computer and sits down. \nNINA Corporate Counsels Payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment. \n(repeats that over and over) \nBill comes up to Peter. \nBILL Hello, Peter. What's happening? Uh\u0085 we have sort of a problem here. Yeah. You apparently didn't put one of the new coversheets on your TPS reports. \nPETER Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that. I, I forgot. \nBILL MMMM..YEAH. YOU SEE, WE'RE PUTTING THE COVERSHEETS ON ALL TPS REPORTS NOW BEFORE THEY GO OUT. DID YOU SEE THE MEMO ABOUT THIS? \nPETER Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've got the memo right here, but, uh, uh, I just forgot. But, uh, it's not shipping out until tomorrow, so there's no problem. \nBILL Yeah. If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on, that will be great. And Uh, I'll go ahead and make sure you get another copy of that memo Mmmm, Ok? \nHe walks away. Peter's phone rings and he answers it. \nPETER Peter Gibbons. (listens) Yes. (listens) I have the memo. \n[Scene Another part of the room. Paper jams in the printer.] \nSAMIR Oh no! Not again! Why does it say paper jam when there is no paper jam?!! I, I swear to God, one of these days, I, I, I just kick this piece of shit out the window!!! \nMICHAEL you and me both, man. The thing is lucky I'm not armed. \nSamir grabs the paper out, tearing off the bottom part of it. \nSAMIR Piece of shit!! \nNina comes with papers. \nNINA Sam...ire...Na...Na...Naga... \nSamir gets it. \nNINA Uh-huh! \nSAMIR Please. \nHe sits in his and Michael's cubicle. \nNINA Michael\u0085 - (Michael reaches for it) Bolton? \nMICHAEL That's me. \nNINA Wow! Is that your real name? \nMICHAEL Yeah. \nNINA So are you related to the singer guy? \nMICHAEL No, it's just a coincidence. \nSAMIR How come no one in this country can pronounce my name right? It's Na- gee-een-ah-jah. Nagaenajar \nMICHAEL At least your name isn't Michael Bolton. \nSAMIR Michael, there's nothing wrong with that name. \nHe goes to his cubicle. \nPETER Our high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you would do if we had a million dollars and didn't have to work. And invariably, whatever we would say, that was supposed to be our careers. If you wanted to build cars, then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic. \nSAMIR So what did you say? \nPETER I never had an answer. I guess that's why I'm working at Initech. \nMICHAEL No, you're working at Initech because that question is bullshit to begin with. (The printer is not working) If that quiz worked, there would be no janitors, because no one would clean shit up if they had a million dollars. \nSAMIR Well, I would invest half of it in ??? Mutual Funds and give the rest of it to my friend, Saheib, in Securities. \nMICHAEL Samir, the point of the exercise is that you could figure out what you want to do. And then (reads the printer's display) \"PC load letter\"?!! What the fuck does that mean?!! \nHe knocks off the paper tray. \n[Scene Peter's apartment. He enters, tired, and sits down on the couch. He then turns on the TV.] \nLAWRENCE (V/O, FROM NEXT DOOR) HEY PETER-MAN! CHECK OUT CHANNEL NINE! IT'S THE BREAST EXAM! CHECK OUT THIS CHICK! \nPETER Lawrence, can't you just pretend like we can't hear each other through the wall? \nLAWRENCE Oh! I'm sorry man, is Anne over there or something? \nPETER No! But if you just want to talk to me, just come over. \nLawrence does so; it takes him like ten seconds. \nLAWRENCE Hey man. Check this out, dude. \nHe changes channels a bunch of times \nPepsi commercial, a soap opera and another show. He stops on breast exam. \nPETER Oh geez, Lawrence. \nLAWRENCE I'm sorry, man. I thought you'd wanna see this. Doesn't this chick look like Anne? \nPETER Yeah, a little bit. \nLAWRENCE Hey, she hasn't been over here in a while. You two still going out? \nPETER I guess, yeah. I, I don't know. Sometimes I get the feeling that she's cheating on me. \nLAWRENCE NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? \nPETER Besides two chicks at the same time? \nLAWRENCE Oh yeah. \nPETER Nothing. \nLAWRENCE Nothing, huh? \nPETER I would relax, I would sit on my ass all day, I would do nothing. \nLAWRENCE You don't need a million dollars to do nothing, man. Take a look at my cousin. He's broke and don't do shit. \n[Scene Peter's room. He's in bed and he keeps hearing voices.] \nNINA Corporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment. \nPeter buries his head in his pillow. \n[Scene The staff meeting. Peter's watch reads Friday 12, 10:37. Everyone's standing outside their cubicles. There's a banner that says \"Is This Good for the COMPANY?\"] \nBILL So you should ask yourself, with every decision that you make (points to the banner) Is this good for the company? Am I helping the best way that I can for the company... \nPETER Is that the guy? \nTOM Yeah... \nBILL Good. Well, uh, I'd like to, uh, welcome a new member to our team. Uh, Bob Slydell. Yeah. Uh, he is, uh, a consultant. Yeah. He is a consultant. (Tom shakes his head) He'll be helping us out a little here, asking some questions, making sure things go a little more smoothly. Yeah. Oh and remember, next Friday is Hawaiian shirt day! So, y'know, if you want to, go ahead and uh, wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans. \n[Scene Milton's cubicle, under the banner. He's on the phone with Peter.] \nMILTON I, I don't care if they, if they lay me off either, because I, I told Bill that if he moves my desk one more time, then, then I'm quitting. I'm going to quit. And I told Dom too because they've moved my desk four times. I used to be by the window, where I could see the squirrels and they were merry. But then they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline. (he's holding his red Swingline) (Camera pans to Peter) They have my staples for the Boston and I kept the staples from the Swingline stapler. \nPETER Ok, Milton. \nMILTON And if, if they take my stapler, I will, I will set this building on fire. \nPETER Oh, that's great. I will talk to you later. \nHe hangs up and looks at his watch \n4:45. Peter looks around and sees Bill. He ducks and peeks to see Bill talking with some workers. He quickly tries to save his files, but the computer is slower than he'd like. Bill is talking to other guys. \nTOM Well, no, my, my secretary does that, or, or the fax. \nBOB SLYDELL Ah. \nBOB PORTER Then you must physically bring them to the software people. \nTOM Well...no. Yeah, I mean, sometimes. \nBOB SLYDELL Well, what would you say\u0085 you do here? \nTOM Well, look, I already told you. I deal with the goddamn customers so the engineers don't have to!! I have people skills!! I am good at dealing with people!!! Can't you understand that?!? WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!!!!!!! \nCUT TO THE CUBICLES. TOM EXITS THE INTERVIEW ROOM AND MICHAEL ENTERS. \nCut to inside. \nBOB SLYDELL Let's see. You're Michael...Bolton? \nHe nods. \nBOB PORTER Is that your real name? \nMICHAEL Yeah. \nBOB PORTER Are you in any relation to the pop singer? \nMICHAEL It's just a coincidence. \nBOB SLYDELL LAUGHS) TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I LOVE HIS MUSIC. I DO . I AM A MICHAEL BOLTON FAN. FOR MY MONEY, I DON'T THINK IT GETS ANY BETTER THAN WHEN HE SINGS WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN. \nBOB PORTER I mean you must really love his music. \nMICHAEL Yeah. Yeah\u0085he, he, he's pretty, he's pretty good, I guess. \nBOB SLYDELL You're GOD DAMN right he is. \nThey laugh. \nBOB PORTER So tell me. What's your favorite song of his? \nMICHAEL Hmm. I, I, I don't know. I mean, I guess, I sorta like 'em all. \nThe Bobs laugh. \nPETER Ok. \nJOANNA So, where do you work, uh, Peter? \nPETER Initech. \nJOANNA And, uh, what do you do there, Peter? \nPETER I sit in a cubicle and I update bank software for the 2000 switch. \nJOANNA NODS) WHAT'S THAT? \nPETER You see, they wrote all this bank software and to save space, they put 98 instead of 1998. So I go through these thousands of lines of code and uh, it doesn't really matter. I, uh, I don't like my job. I don't think I'm gonna go anymore. \nJOANNA You're just not gonna go? \nPETER Yeah. \nJOANNA Won't you get fired? \nPETER I don't know. But I really don't like it so I'm not gonna go. \nJOANNA LAUGHS) SO YOU'RE GONNA QUIT? \nPETER No, no, not really. I'm just gonna stop going. \nJOANNA When did you decide all that? \nPETER About a week ago. \nJOANNA Really? \nPETER Oh, yeah. \nJOANNA Ok. So, so you're gonna get another job? \nPETER I don't think I 'd like another job. \nJOANNA LAUGHS) SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MONEY AND BILLS? \nPETER Y'know, I never really liked paying bill? I don't think I'll do that either. \nJOANNA LAUGHS) SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? \nHe walks off. \nMILTON Ok. I'll set the building on fire. \n[Scene Hallway at Initech. Peter enters in casual clothes. Milton walks up to him.] \nMICHAEL Peter! \nPETER Michael! \nMICHAEL What the hell's going on, man? I thought you were going to come in here and start shooting. \nPETER I just came to get my address book. I'm not gonna stay. I've got a number I don't wanna lose. \nMICHAEL What?! Peter, you're in deep shit! You were supposed to come in on Saturday. What were you doing? \nPETER Michael, I did nothing. I did absolutely nothing and it was everything that I thought it could be. \nMICHAEL Well, I hope you have a better story than that for Lumbergh. You know, you're supposed to be having your interview right now with the consultants. \nPETER Who? \nHe writes down Joanna's number. \nMICHAEL What has gotten into you? \nPETER Oh yeah. Right. \nMICHAEL Peter, Peter you, gotta postpone it man. Tell them you were sick. Make something up. \nPETER Ah, no way. I feel great. \n[Scene The interview room.] \nBOB PORTER The next paper looks like a Peter Gibbons. \nPeter enters. \nBOB SLYDELL Aha! All right. We were just talking about you. You must be Peter Gibbons. Uh huh. Terrific. I'm Bob Slydell and this is my associate, Bob Porter. \nPETER Hi, Bob. Bob. \nBOB PORTER Why don't you grab a seat and join us for a minute? \nBOB SLYDELL Wow. \nCut to the cubicle's. Peter walks past them and into the hall. \nBILL Hey, Peter, what's happening? Listen, uh - \nPeter walks right past him. \n[Scene Chotchkie's] \nSTAN Joanna? Would you come here for a moment, please? \nJOANNA I'm sorry. I was late. I was having lunch. \nSTAN I need to talk about your flair. \nJOANNA Really? I have 15 buttons on. I, uh, (shows him \nSTAN Well, ok, 15 is minimum, ok? \nJOANNA Ok. \nSTAN Now, it's up to you whether or not you want to just do the bare minimum. Well, like Brian, for example, has 37 pieces of flair. And a terrific smile. \nJOANNA Ok. Ok, you want me to wear more? \nSTAN Look. Joanna. \nJOANNA Yeah. \nSTAN People can get a cheeseburger anywhere, ok? They come to Chotchkie's for the atmosphere and the attitude. That's what the flair's about. It's about fun. \nJOANNA Ok. So, more then? \nSTAN Look, we want you to express yourself, ok? If you think the bare minimum is enough, then ok. But some people choose to wear more and we encourage that, ok? You do want to express yourself, don't you? \nJOANNA Yeah. Yeah. \nSTAN Great. Great. That's all I ask. \nJOANNA Ok. \n[Scene Conference room. Dom and Bill are talking to the two Bob's.] \nBILL Yeah... \n[Scene Peter parks in Bill's usual spot and goes into the building. He takes a drill and removes the metal door handle.] \nCut to outside, where Bill has to park in the handicap spot. \nCut back inside. Peter tears down the banner. \nCut to outside. Bill's Porsche is being towed away. They only manage to pull off the bumper. \nCut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu. They're about to kiss. \nLAWRENCE Hey Peter man! Check out channel nine! It's a breast exam! Whoo!! \nCut to Peter's cubicle. Bill checks his watch because Peter's still not there. \nCut to a lake. Lawrence, Peter and Joanna are fishing. Peter holds up a big fish. \nCut to Initech. Peter enters with an Igloo cooler. \nDOM Hello, Peter. \nPETER Hey Dom! \nHe slaps him on the back. \nCut to Peter's cubicle. He puts the fish on his desk and starts to gut it. He throws its entrails on a stack of TPS reports. \nCut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu. \nCut to Peter removing the screws in the cubicle wall. He pushes it over. It reveals a window and Peter relaxes. \n[Scene Peter's cubicle, now with only one wall. he's playing Tetris as Bill walks up.] \nBILL So, Peter, what's happening? Now are you going to go ahead and have those TPS reports for us this afternoon? (Peter keeps playing) Uh, yeah. So I guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk, hmm? \nPETER Not right now, Lumbergh. I'm, I'm kinda busy. In fact, I'm going to have to ask you to go ahead and just come back another time. I have a meeting with the Bobs in a couple of minutes. \nBILL Uh, I wasn't aware of a meeting with them. \nPETER Yeah, they called me at home. \nBILL That sounds good, Peter. Uh, and we'll go ahead and, uh, get this all fixed up for you later. \nPETER You're gonna layoff Samir and Michael!? \nBOB PORTER We're gonna bring in some entry level graduates for us to work in Singapore, that's the usual deal. \nBOB SLYDELL Well, it's standard operating procedure. \nPETER Do they know about this yet? \nBOB SLYDELL No! No, of course not. We always find it's better to fire people on a Friday. It's statistically shown that there's less chance of an incident if we do it at the end of the week. Anyway, Peter, what we would like to do is put you into a position where you would have as many as four people working right underneath you. \nBOB PORTER This is a big promotion, Pete. \nBOB SLYDELL Huge. \nPETER So you're gonna fire Samir and Michael and give me more money? \nBOB SLYDELL Umm-hmm. \nPETER Wow! \n[Scene Michael is messing with the printer.] \nMICHAEL Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's exactly what I need. Just give it to me. Come on. Come on, you little fucker. Let's go! That's what I need. Let's do that. Let's do exactly that, you little, fu- \nPeter walks up to him. \nPETER Listen... Well, what are you doing tonight? \n[Scene Peter's place. Michael, Samir and Peter are there.] \nPETER There comes a place in a man's life and, uh, maybe that time for you is now, when it doesn't hurt to think about the future. \nMICHAEL Uh, no offense, there, Peter, but think about yourself, sport. You're the one who's been flaking out at work. Whatever that religious experience or whatever the hell it was, you better snap out of it, or you're gonna get canned. \nPETER Yeah. I, I, I...Listen, that virus you're always talking about. The one that, that could rip off the company for a bunch of money... \nMICHAEL Yeah? What about it? \nPETER Well, how does it work? \nMICHAEL It's pretty brilliant. What it does is where there's a bank transaction, and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in fractions of a cent, which it usually rounds off. What this does is it takes those remainders and puts it into your account. \nPETER This sounds familiar. \nSAMIR Superman III - that's it, I have to leave now, ok? (gets up) I have to get my resume ready. \nPETER Get your resume ready for what? Another job where they can fire you for no reason? \nSAMIR That's right! If I'm lucky. \nPETER Look, I don't know about you guys, but I'm tired of being pushed around. Aren't you? \nSAMIR Yes, Peter, but I'm not going to do something illegal. \nPETER Illegal? Samir, this is America! Come on, sit down! Come on! This isn't Riyadh! They're not gonna saw your hands off, all right? The worse they can do is put you for a couple of months into a while collar, minimum security resort! Shit, we should be so lucky! Did you know they have conjugal visits there? \nSAMIR Really. \nPETER Yes. \nMICHAEL Shit, I'm afraid. I haven't had a conjugal visit in six months. \nSAMIR So what do you think? \nMICHAEL This thing actually is pretty fail-safe, Samir. \nPETER You came here looking for a land of opportunity. And this is the knock of that opportunity. Tomorrow's your last day at Initech. You have two options \nunemployment or early retirement. What's it gonna be? \nSAMIR I have a question. \nPETER Yes. \nSAMIR In, in these conjugal visits, you can have sex with women? \nPETER Yep. You sure can. \nSAMIR Ok. I'm gonna do it. \nPETER That's what I'm talking about! I'm talking about America!! \nMICHAEL Peter Let's discuss the plan, all right? \nPETER All right. \nMICHAEL All right. It works like a computer virus. All right? So all we have to do is load it anywhere into the credit union mainframe and it'll do the rest. \nJOANNA Oh, for everybody. Ok. \nPETER Yeah, well, those are whole pennies. \nJOANNA Yeah. \nPETER Right. I'm just talking about fractions of a penny here, but we do it from a much bigger tray. A couple of million times. So what's wrong with that? \nJOANNA It seems wrong. \nPETER It's not wrong. Initech is wrong. Initech is an evil corporation, all right? Chotchkie's is wrong. Doesn't it bother you that you have to get up in the morning and put on pieces of flair? \nJOANNA Yeah, but I'm not about to go in and start taking money from the register! \nPETER You know, the Nazis had pieces of flair but they made the Jews wear them. \nJOANNA What?! \nPETER Look, we don't - I, I - we don't have to talk about this. Let's just go to the barbecue, all right? \nJOANNA Ok. \n[Scene Tom's house. Samir and Michael open the front door. tom is in a full body cast and is hooked up to a bunch of stuff.] \nTOM Michael! Samir! How are you doing? \nMICHAEL Hiya Tom. \nSAMIR Hi Tom. \nTOM Yeah, I'd like you to meet my lawyer, Rob Newhouse. (they shake hands) Rob, Michael. \nROB Hello Michael. \nTOM Samir. \nROB Hello - \nSAMIR Samir. \nROB ...Samir. \n(Peter and Joanna enter. \nDREW That's something about old Tom Smykowski, huh? \nPETER Yeah. \nDREW Lucky bastard. (sees Joanna) Hey, isn't that the girl who works over at Chotchkie's? \nPETER Yeah. \nDREW Hmm, who's she here with? \nPETER She's here with me. \nDREW Really? \nPETER Yeah. \nDREW All right, Peter! Ooh! Ooh! Right on. Make sure you wear a rubber, dude. \nPETER Why's that, Drew? \nDREW Are you kidding me? She gets around, all right? \nPETER She does, does she? \nDREW Oh yeah. Like a record. \nJoanna waves. \nPETER With who? \nDREW Well, let's see. Lumbergh fucked her. Ah, let me see who else... \nPETER Lumbergh?! \n[Scene Peter's car. He and Joanna are leaving the party.] \nJOANNA Oh, what if you get caught? Oh, I, I, I, I just don't know if this is such a good idea. \nPETER ANGRY) YEAH? WELL, MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO SLEEP WITH LUMBERGH! \nJOANNA What?! What are you - Oh! All right, Lumbergh... \nPETER ARGH!!! AH GOD! LUMBERGH!! \nJOANNA Yeah? \nSTAN We need to talk. Do you know what this is about? \nJOANNA My, uh, flair. \nSTAN Yeah. Or, uh, your lack thereof. I'm counting and I only see fifteen pieces. Let me ask you a question, Joanna. \nJOANNA Umm-hmm. \nSTAN What do you think of a person who only does the bare minimum? \nJOANNA Huh. What do I think? Let me tell you what I think, Stan. If you want me to wear thirty-seven pieces of flair like your pretty boy Brian over there, then why don't you just make the minimum thirty-seven pieces of flair? \nSTAN Well, I thought I remember you saying you wanted to express yourself. \nJOANNA Yeah. Yeah. Y'know what? I do. I do want to express myself. Ok? And I don't need thirty-seven pieces of flair to do it. (gives him the finger) All right? There's my flair! And this is me expressing myself. (holds up her hand) There it is! I hate this job! I hate this goddamn job and I don't need it!! \nShe storms out. \n[Scene An ATM machine. Peter gets out a receipt that says he has \n[Scene Peter's car. Samir and Michael have obviously seen the receipt.] \nSAMIR Shit, shit, shit, shit. Son of a bitch! Shit! This is a - fuck! Son of a bitch! Shit! \nMICHAEL What happened? \nPETER You tell me, Michael, it's your software! \nSAMIR Yes, it's your software! \nPETER Corporate accounting is sure as hell going to notice 305, 3 (grabs the receipt) 26.13!! Michael!! \nMICHAEL Oh shit! They, they probably won't notice it's gone for another two or three days. \nPETER Michael! Michael! You said the thing was gonna take two years! \nSAMIR What happened?! \nPETER You said the thing was supposed to work. \nMICHAEL Well, technically it did work. \nPETER That's a great idea. Ok, how do we do that? \nMICHAEL I don't know, I don't know. I don't even know what it means. It's something I think, I think coke dealers do. \nPETER Ok. Do we know any coke dealers? \nMICHAEL My, my cousin's a cokehead. We're in deep shit. \nSAMIR Yes. We are in very, very deep shit. \n[Scene Milton's new \"office\" - the basement. Bill enters with a piece of cake.] \nBILL Milton? \nMILTON Yes. \nBILL What's happening? \nMILTON I wanted to see you because - \nBILL Say, you know what would be a great idea? \nMILTON No...no. \nBILL Since you're already down here, it would be great if you could get a ca of pesticipe and take care of the cockroach problem we've been having in here. \nMILTON I...I...that's really not my job and I haven't received my - \nBILL For now, why don't you get a flashlight and a can of pesticide and - \nDom enters. \nDOM Bill! We need you upstairs right away. Some major glitch in the accounting. A lot of money missing. \nThey go upstairs and Bill turns off the light. \nMILTON Excuse me? Excuse me? Ok, that's the last straw. \n[Scene Peter's place. Michael is looking up \"money laundering\" in the dictionary.] \nMICHAEL LAUNDERING. TO CLEAN...NO, UH, HERE IT IS. TO CHANNEL MONEY THROUGH A SOURCE OR BY AN INTERMEDIARY. \nSAMIR It doesn't really help us, Michael. \nPETER He doesn't know anything, all right? \nSAMIR Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. You just give us the name of one drug dealer. I could talk to him. I have good networking skills. \nSTEVE NORMAL) I LIED. ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT ME BEING A CRACKHEAD WAS TO HELP ME SELL MAGAZINES. I'M A SOFTWARE ENGINEER. \nPETER You're a software engineer?! \nSAMIR Working must be, must be very hard for you. \nSTEVE I made more money selling magazine subscriptions than I ever did working at Initrode. \nMICHAEL Huh? You worked at Initrode? \nPETER You can't tell anybody about any of this stuff I told you. I mean, we know a lot of the same people. \nSTEVE Actually, that all depends. \nHe holds up his clipboard. \nCut to later. Peter closes the door. \nPETER What am I going to do with forty subscriptions to Vibe ? \nMICHAEL I wish we had never done this. What are we going to do? You know what I can't figure out? How is it that all these stupid, Neanderthal, Mafia guys can be so good at crime and smart guys like us can suck so badly at it? \nSAMIR We're new to it, though. If we had more experience - \nMICHAEL No. No. Y'know what I think? I think we're screwed. There's evidence all over that building to link it to us. Even if we could launder money, I wouldn't want to. If we're caught while laundering money, we're not going to go to white-collar-resort-prison. No, no, no. We're gonna go to federal-reserve-pound-me-in-the-ass-prison. \nSAMIR I don't want to go to any prison! Why the hell did I do this?! I've never done anything wrong in my whole life! We weren't thinking clearly because you told us we were losing our jobs! And look at us now, we're, we're worried about going to prison! \nPETER Don't worry about it. I'll think of something. \nSAMIR Ass. I'm going home. You are a very bad person, Peter. \nSamir and Michael leave. Peter knocks on the wall. \nPETER Lawrence! You awake? \nLAWRENCE Yeah, man! \nPETER You wanna come over? \nSECRETARY Um, why don't you go and sit at your desk. Mr. Lumbergh should be here any minute. \nMILTON Mr. Lumbergh - \nSECRETARY Just go and sit at your desk. \nMILTON But - \nSECRETARY Oh? \nMILTON Ok, I, I, I'm going to set the building on fire. I tell him, if I don't get my stapler (the secretary leaves) I'm going to have to get my stapler back because it is my stapler. (he goes into Mr. Lumbergh's office) It's my stapler, the Swingline. It's been mine for a very long time. \n[Scene Peter's room. He's packing his clothes. He goes outside and knocks on Lawrence's door.] \nPETER Hey, Lawrence, are you there? \nLAWRENCE Hey, Peter, man. \nPETER Hey. So, I may be going away for awhile. \nLAWRENCE Yeah, I know, man. It's a bummer, dude, what can I say? \nPETER Yeah. Well, it's time to go face the music. You take care of yourself, cause I don't wanna see ya. \nThey shake hands. \nLAWRENCE You too, man. Take care.

I could come up with a program that could rip that place off big time\u0085big time. \nPETER Yeah. \nCut to Joanna, a pretty waitress. \nCut back to the guys. \nPETER Oh, there she is. \nSAMIR Peter, you, you always talk about this girl. If you're so obsessed with her, why don't you just ask her out? \nPETER Because I'm just another asshole customer. You can't just walk up to a waitress and ask her out. (cut to Joanna, and back to them) Plus, I'm still trying to work it out with Anne. Oh, that reminds me. I'm not going to be able to play poker with you guys on Friday. \nMICHAEL Why not? \nPETER Uh, I have to see this occupational hypnotherapist with Anne. \nMICHAEL Dude! An occupational hypnotherapist?! \nPETER Anne wants me to go. She thinks it might help. Y'know, sometimes I just think, I keep thinking that she's cheating on me. \nMICHAEL Yeah. I know what you mean. \nSAMIR Yeah. \nPETER What is that supposed to mean? \nMICHAEL Nothing. Why don't you just tell Anne you're not into hypnosis and you want to play poker with us? \nPETER Ah, I can't do that. She might get all pissed off at me. Besides, I think the guy might be able to help. He did help Anne lose weight. \nSAMIR Peter, she's anorexic. \nPETER Yeah, I know. The guy's really good. \nMICHAEL An occupational hypnotherapist isn't going to help you solve any of your problems. And speaking of problems, what's this I hear about you having problems with your TPS reports? \nSAMIR Yeah. Didn't you get that memo? \nPeter sighs. \n", "test1_true": "TOM Hey! Hey, guys! Samir!! \nSAMIR Is that Tom Smykowski? \nPETER What's he doing? \nMICHAEL Oh, probably working on another heart attack. \nTOM Have you guys see this? \nHe hands them a piece of paper. \nMICHAEL What? It's the staff meeting. So what? \nTOM We're all screwed, that's what. They're gonna downsize Initech. \nSAMIR Oh, what are you talking about Tom? How do you know that? \nTOM They're bringing in a consultant - that's how I know. That's what this staff meeting is all about! That's what happened at Initrode last year. You have an interview with a consultant and they bring in efficiency experts. You're interviewing for your own job! \nMICHAEL Tom, every week you say you're losing your job and you're still here. \nTOM I'm going to be the first one they're gonna lay off. Just the thought of having to go to the State Unemployment Office and having to stand in line with those scumbags!!! \n[Scene Michael and Samir's cubicle. They're sitting there worrying.] \nMICHAEL Shit. Shit. \nTOM You know there are people in this world who don't have to put up with all this shit? Like that guy that invented the pet rock. You see, that's what you have to do. You have to use your mind and come up with some really great idea like that and you never have to work again! \nMICHAEL I don't think the pet rock was really such a good idea. \nTOM The guy made a million dollars! Y'know\u0085 I had an idea like that once. \nPETER Really? What was it, Tom? \nTOM Well, all right. It was a Jump\u0085 to Conclusions-mat. You see, it would be this mat that you would put on the floor and it would have different conclusions written on it that you could\u0085jump to. \nMICHAEL That is the worse idea I've ever heard in my life, Tom. \nSAMIR Yes, yes, it's horrible\u0085this idea\u0085. \nTOM Ah, look. I, I gotta get outta here.

Peter answers it. \nPETER Hello? \nANNE Peter, what's going on?! \nPETER Huh? \nANNE It's 3:30. Why aren't you at work?! \nPETER Because I didn't feel like it. \nANNE Peter, what is wrong with you?! First, you sit there while Dr. Swanson dies and you just walk out of the car and embarrass me in front of my friends. Don't blame this on hypnosis either. That's total bull! \nPeter hangs up but Anne calls back. \nANNE ANSWERING MACHINE) LISTEN, ASSHOLE. NO ONE HANGS UP ON ME. WE'RE THROUGH!!! AND \u0096HA- ONE MORE THING. I'VE BEEN CHEATING ON YOU!!!!

Another staff meeting.] \nBILL From now on, you use the time sheets if you work on two or more job codes and you need the extra columns to fit it all in.

Would you like to have lunch with me? \nJOANNA Oh, are you serious? Yeah, I don't , I don't think I'm supposed to do that. \nPETER Oh. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go next door and get a table and if you'd like to join me, no big deal. All right? And if not, that's cool too. Ok? \nHe starts to walk away. \nJOANNA Uh, when you say \"next door\", do you mean Chili's or Flingers? \nPETER Flingers. \nJOANNA Ok. \n[Scene Initech. Bob Slydell and Bob Porter are interviewing Tom.] \nBOB SLYDELL So what you do is you take the specifications from the customers and you bring them down to the software engineers? \nTOM That, that's right. \nBOB PORTER Well, then I gotta ask, then why can't the customers just take the specifications directly to the software people, huh? \nTOM Well, uh, uh, uh, because, uh, engineers are not good at dealing with customers. \nBOB SLYDELL You physically take the specs from the customer? \n", "test2_id": 2563, "test3_input": "DREW V/O) BUT THAT WIFE OF HIS COMES HOME EARLY FROM WORK EARLY AND FOUND HIM IN THE CAR AND TRIES TO PLAY IT OFF AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED. \nTOM COUGH) I WAS HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH THE SHIFTER HERE.

He broke both his wrists, his legs, a couple of ribs, his back. But check it out. He's gonna get a huge settlement out of this. Like seven figures. He's getting out of the hospital this weekend and he's throwing a big party to celebrate. I'm thinking I'm gonna take that new chick from Logistics. I might be showing her my O face. Oh! Oh! Oh! you know what I'm talking about. Oh! Yeah. Right. See you guys there. \n[Scene Peter's car. Samir and Michael are with him.] \nMICHAEL Wow, our last day at Initech. \nSAMIR I can't believe they had security escort us out. Not like we're gonna steal something. \nPETER I stole something. \nMICHAEL Oh yeah.

He and Joanna are going to the barbecue.] \nPETER So when the subroutine compounds the interest, right, it uses all these extra decimals places that just get rounded off. So we just simplify the whole thing and we just round it down and drop the remainder into an account that we own. \nJOANNA So you're stealing. \nPETER Ah, no. No. You don't understand. It's, uh, very complicated. It's, uh, it's, it's aggregate so I'm talking about fractions of a cent that, uh, over time, they add up to a lot. \nJOANNA Ok. So you're gonna make a lot of money, right? \nPETER Yeah. \nJOANNA Ok. That's not yours? \nPETER Well, it, it becomes ours. \nJOANNA How's that not stealing? \nPETER I don't think, I don't think I'm explaining this very well. Um, this Seven Eleven, right?

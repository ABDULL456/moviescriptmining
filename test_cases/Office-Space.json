If you're so obsessed with her, why don't you just ask her out? \nPETER Because I'm just another asshole customer. You can't just walk up to a waitress and ask her out. (cut to Joanna, and back to them) Plus, I'm still trying to work it out with Anne. Oh, that reminds me. I'm not going to be able to play poker with you guys on Friday. \nMICHAEL Why not? \nPETER Uh, I have to see this occupational hypnotherapist with Anne. \nMICHAEL Dude! An occupational hypnotherapist?! \nPETER Anne wants me to go. She thinks it might help. Y'know, sometimes I just think, I keep thinking that she's cheating on me. \nMICHAEL Yeah. I know what you mean. \nSAMIR Yeah. \nPETER What is that supposed to mean? \nMICHAEL Nothing. Why don't you just tell Anne you're not into hypnosis and you want to play poker with us? \nPETER Ah, I can't do that. She might get all pissed off at me. Besides, I think the guy might be able to help. He did help Anne lose weight. \nSAMIR Peter, she's anorexic. \nPETER Yeah, I know. The guy's really good. \nMICHAEL An occupational hypnotherapist isn't going to help you solve any of your problems. And speaking of problems, what's this I hear about you having problems with your TPS reports? \nSAMIR Yeah. Didn't you get that memo? \nPeter sighs. \n", "test1_true": "TOM Hey! Hey, guys! Samir!! \nSAMIR Is that Tom Smykowski? \nPETER What's he doing? \nMICHAEL Oh, probably working on another heart attack. \nTOM Have you guys see this? \nHe hands them a piece of paper. \nMICHAEL What? It's the staff meeting. So what? \nTOM We're all screwed, that's what. They're gonna downsize Initech. \nSAMIR Oh, what are you talking about Tom? How do you know that? \nTOM They're bringing in a consultant - that's how I know. That's what this staff meeting is all about! That's what happened at Initrode last year. You have an interview with a consultant and they bring in efficiency experts. You're interviewing for your own job! \nMICHAEL Tom, every week you say you're losing your job and you're still here. \nTOM I'm going to be the first one they're gonna lay off. Just the thought of having to go to the State Unemployment Office and having to stand in line with those scumbags!!! \n[Scene Michael and Samir's cubicle. They're sitting there worrying.] \nMICHAEL Shit. Shit. \nTOM You know there are people in this world who don't have to put up with all this shit? Like that guy that invented the pet rock. You see, that's what you have to do. You have to use your mind and come up with some really great idea like that and you never have to work again! \nMICHAEL I don't think the pet rock was really such a good idea. \nTOM The guy made a million dollars! Y'know\u0085 I had an idea like that once. \nPETER Really? What was it, Tom? \nTOM Well, all right. It was a Jump\u0085 to Conclusions-mat. You see, it would be this mat that you would put on the floor and it would have different conclusions written on it that you could\u0085jump to. \nMICHAEL That is the worse idea I've ever heard in my life, Tom. \nSAMIR Yes, yes, it's horrible\u0085this idea\u0085. \nTOM Ah, look.

And invariably, whatever we would say, that was supposed to be our careers. If you wanted to build cars, then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic. \nSAMIR So what did you say? \nPETER I never had an answer. I guess that's why I'm working at Initech. \nMICHAEL No, you're working at Initech because that question is bullshit to begin with. (The printer is not working) If that quiz worked, there would be no janitors, because no one would clean shit up if they had a million dollars. \nSAMIR Well, I would invest half of it in ??? Mutual Funds and give the rest of it to my friend, Saheib, in Securities. \nMICHAEL Samir, the point of the exercise is that you could figure out what you want to do.

But if you just want to talk to me, just come over. \nLawrence does so; it takes him like ten seconds. \nLAWRENCE Hey man. Check this out, dude. \nHe changes channels a bunch of times \nPepsi commercial, a soap opera and another show. He stops on breast exam. \nPETER Oh geez, Lawrence. \nLAWRENCE I'm sorry, man. I thought you'd wanna see this. Doesn't this chick look like Anne? \nPETER Yeah, a little bit. \nLAWRENCE Hey, she hasn't been over here in a while. You two still going out? \nPETER I guess, yeah.

(sits on the couch) I gotta wake my ass up at six AM every day of this week and drag myself up to Vascalinas. Yeah, I'm doing the drywall up there at the new McDonalds. \nPETER Let me ask you something. When you come in on Mondays, and you're not feeling too well, does anybody ever come up to you and say \"sounds like someone's got a case of the Mondays\"? \nLAWRENCE No. No, man, shit, no, man. I believe you get your ass kicked for sayin' something like that, man. \nPETER Huh. \nLAWRENCE We still going fishing this weekend? \nPETER Nah. Lumbergh's gonna make me come in this Saturday. I know it. \nLAWRENCE Well, you can get out of that easily. \nPETER Yeah, how? \nLAWRENCE (Gets up) Well, when you work on an Saturday, he generally asks you at the end of the day, right? (gets a beer) So all you have to do is avoid him \u0096 (peter offers him a bottle cap remover) That's all right, i got one \u0096 (he gets on from his pocket) The last few hours of the day. And turn off your answering machine, you should be home free then. \nPETER That's a really good idea. (sits on the couch) Lawrence, what would you do if you had a million dollars? \nHe sits down. \nLAWRENCE I'll tell you what I'll do, man--Two chicks at the same time. \nPeter laughs. \nPETER That's it? If you had a million dollars, that's what you'd do, two chicks at the same time? \nLAWRENCE Damn straight, man. I've always wanted to do that. I figure if I were a millionaire, I could hook that up.

So we just simplify the whole thing and we just round it down and drop the remainder into an account that we own. \nJOANNA So you're stealing. \nPETER Ah, no. No. You don't understand. It's, uh, very complicated. It's, uh, it's, it's aggregate so I'm talking about fractions of a cent that, uh, over time, they add up to a lot. \nJOANNA Ok. So you're gonna make a lot of money, right? \nPETER Yeah. \nJOANNA Ok. That's not yours? \nPETER Well, it, it becomes ours. \nJOANNA How's that not stealing? \nPETER I don't think, I don't think I'm explaining this very well. Um, this Seven Eleven, right?

MED. CLOSE - UP ANGLE 
featuring Clay. Clay suddenly averts his glance and winces as the doctor probes the wound in Steve's arm. Steve groans. The lamp wavers. 
DOCTOR (sharply) Hold her steady. I'm not hurting him. 
STEVE Maybe you're not, but I'll sure be glad when you stop pokin' me. 
Footsteps are HEARD approaching. Clay tries to steady his shaking hand. He is focusing his attention on a far wall. A woman's hand comes in the scene and takes the lamp from him. He reacts. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Mary, who has moved in beside him.

CLAY Thanks for taking over. 
MARY (softly) Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it. 
CLAY Like I said, women get in the way sometimes.

DOCTOR Keep still, will you. 
He straightens into the shot. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO MED. SHOT. Steve is now bandaged. 
DOCTOR Put him over there on the cot. Goodnight... He'll be all right. 
As Clay lifts Steve to the cot the doctor exits. Mary watches Clay cover Steve. Then she goes to the door leading to the street, stops with her hand on the knob. 
MARY Goodnight. 
STEVE Goodnight, Miss Wells.

CLAY That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet? 
MARY Why? 
CLAY (haltingly) Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that. 
MARY (softly) I haven't got the job yet. 
They look at each other. 
MARY But if you want to wait until tomorrow -- 
For answer, Clay takes her in his arms.

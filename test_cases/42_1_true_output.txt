(CHECKS MIRROR) Told us more men were coming. Maybe those boys. Mr. Rickey said to get you to Daytona Beach a-s-a-p. 
JACK Why didn't you say so? 
SMITH Mr. Rickey was afraid you wouldn't leave, that you would fight. As it becomes clear, Jack starts to LAUGH. 
SMITH What the hell are you laughing at? 
JACK I thought you woke me because I was cut from the team. Jack LAUGHS harder. Wendell LAUGHS as well. As it fades, Jack looks back over his shoulder. Jesus... 
CUT TO: 
44 EXT. CITY ISLAND BALLPARK - DAYTONA BEACH - DAY 44 
A stadium SIGN boasts Brooklyn Dodgers vs. Montreal Royals. 
PINK REV 4-19-12 35. Daytona Beach's black community is turning out to see Jackie Robinson. Hundreds of people line up, mass at the: Colored Entrance. In their Sunday best. Families. Couples. The old. The frail. Young boys chase after each other. One MOTHER stands on her toes to spot her son. 
MOTHER Ed! You stay where I can see you! 13-year old ED CHARLES turns, waves his baseball glove over his head so she can see him. Then to no one in particular: 
ED I'm thirteen years old. WHITE PEOPLE enter at several gates around them. 
CUT TO: 
45 CLOSE ON BRANCH RICKEY - THE DODGER DUGOUT 45 He sits watching as the segregated bleachers in right fill with BLACK FANS. All else is white. Rickey pops a PEANUT in his mouth, confides to someone alongside him we don't see. 
RICKEY I've spoken to the mayor. I've explained how much money we'll spend in Daytona. But still, when this fine young Negro man steps on that field today, he and the Dodgers will technically be breaking the law. A law which says white and black players cannot enjoy the same field at the same time. Does that make sense to you? Does Jim Crow make any sense when placed against the words of the United States Constitution? When placed against the word of God? POP OUT to reveal he sits beside the DODGER BATBOY, so short his feet don't touch the ground. Rickey offers his peanut bag. As the batboy takes one... 
RICKEY I'll tell you, it does not make sense to me.

49 EXT. ON DECK CIRCLE - CITY ISLAND BALLPARK - DAY 49 
Jack swinging two bats to get loose. Watches as the Montreal BATTER hits a LINE DRIVE which -- Pee Wee Reese nearly leaps out of his socks to bring down. Wow... As the CROWD claps in appreciation, Jack takes a deep breath. 
PA ANNOUNCER Now batting the second baseman -- Jackie Robinson! Jack wincing as he steps forward to both cheers and boos from the white sections. As a âgo home, coon' drifts over -- A BIG OVATION from the black section in right drowns it out. 
COLORED SECTION - RIGHT FIELD Rachel sits with Smith. They react to some of the INVECTIVE coming from the white section. 
RACHEL Jack's got a thick skin. He'll be okay. 
SMITH How about you? 
RACHEL 
(SHRUGS) I better get one in a hurry. 
INFIELD Higbe watching from the mound as Jack steps into the batter's box. Two well wishing voices from the infield stands. 
SPECTATOR ONE Come on, black boy, you can make the grade! 
SPECTATOR TWO They're giving you a chance! Do something about it! Jack heartened at the words. Concentrates as Higbe's first pitch is fired. High and tight, Jack jerks out of the way. 
YELLOW REV 4-24-12 37. Bragan, behind the plate, chucks the ball back, grins up at Jack who does not look down at him as he settles back in. 
ED CHARLES The 13-year-old holding his hands together in prayer. 
ED Please, God, let Jackie show them what we can do. 
HOME PLATE Here comes the next pitch. Even tighter. Jack nearly hit. 
UMPIRE Ball two! Jack glaring, crowds the plate more. Bragan shows 1, taps his right thigh signalling outside. Jack watches it sail, doesn't bite. The umpire: âBall Three!â Higbe's fun slipping away as he can't find the strike zone. 
HIGBE Come on, Rook! Ain't you gonna swing at something?! Jack takes a practice swing, waits as Bragan sets up right over the plate. Here comes the pitch. Low. âBall four!â 
RACHEL & SMITH A big, over-reacting CHEER from the Colored section. 
SMITH It's just a walk. 
RACHEL Who can blame them? 
HIGBE Looks ill-tempered over to first where Jack gives the same look back as he sidesteps an enormous, defiant lead off the bag. Higbe incredulous. Did he just do that? 
DUROCHER 
(FROM DUGOUT) Well throw over there for crying out loud! Higbe fires to LAVAGETTO at first. Jack dives back in time. 
YELLOW REV 4-24-12 38. Higbe gets the ball back, settles. Jack takes a lead, but a modest one this time. Here come the pitch -- And Jack goes. You knew he was fast; but not this fast. Bragan's throw to Pee Wee is late and high. Pee Wee throws back to Higbe. Higbe sets. Bragan gives him a sign. Jack takes a lead. On the wind-up, Jack goes. Bragan stands -- it's a PITCH OUT. Bragan fires to third and Jack is caught in a RUN DOWN. It seems like half the team gets involved with Higbe finally getting the ball by third and Jack ducking under the tag. Safe! A BUZZ goes through the stadium now as people start to realize they are not watching something or someone ordinary.

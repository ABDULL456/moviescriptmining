GILLIS Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted. 
BETTY I don't want it now. 
GILLIS Why not? Don't you love Artie? 
BETTY Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more. 
GILLIS What happened? 
BETTY You did. 
There is a moment's pause before he takes her in his arms.  THE CAMERA MOVES AWAY. 
DISSOLVE TO:

Maybe I could get away with it, get away from Norma.  Maybe I could wipe the whole nasty mess right out of my life... From Norma's room comes the sound of a telephone being dialled.  Gillis enters the shot and stands listening. 
NORMA'S VOICE Is this Gladstone 0858? 
E-21    NORMA'S BEDROOM Norma lies in bed, dialing a number.  She has the beauty patches at the corners of her eyes and over her nose. 
NORMA Can I speak to Miss Betty Schaefer? She must be home by now. 
E-22    A BEDROOM IN BETTY'S FLAT 
Connie, a girl of Betty's age with whom she shares the flat, is on the phone.  Betty, in a dressing- gown, comes from the bathroom, toothbrush in hand. 
CONNIE (Hand over mouthpiece) Betty, here's that weird-sounding woman again. 
BETTY What is this anyway? (Taking the phone) This is Betty Schaefer. 
E-23    NORMA AT IHE PHONE 
NORMA Miss Schaefer, you must forgive me for calling you so late, but I really feel it's my duty.  It's about Mr. Gillis.  You do know Mr. Gillis? ...Exactly how much do you know about him? Do you know where he lives? Do you know how he lives? Do you know what he lives on? 
E-24    BETTY AT THE PHONE 
BETTY Who are you? What do you want? What business is it of yours anyway? 
E-25    NORMA ON THE PHONE 
NORMA Miss Schaefer, I'm trying to do you a favor.  I'm trying to spare you a great deal of misery.  Of course you may be too young to even suspect there are men of his sort... 
NORMA (Cont'd) I don't know what he's told you, but he does not live with relatives, nor with friends, in the usual sense of the word.  Ask him ... Ask him again. 
During the latter part of her call, the doors from Gillis' room have been pushed open and Gillis has walked towards her.  Suddenly Norma senses his pre- sence and turns around.  The telephone freezes in her hand.  She tries to hang it up.  Very calmly Gillis takes the receiver from her hand. 
GILLIS (Into phone) That's right, Betty, ask me again. This is Joe. 
E-26    BETTY ON THE PHONE 
BETTY Joe, where are you? What's this all about? 
E-27    GILLIS ON THE PHONE 
Norma beside him. 
GILLIS Or maybe it would be a better idea if you came over and saw it for yourself.  The address is 10086 
He hangs up.  Norma looks up at him as he crosses to the other end of the room and stands staring at her. The silence becomes unbearable. 
NORMA Don't hate me, Joe.  I did it because I need you.  I need you as I never needed you.  Look at me.  Look at my hands, look at my face, look under my eyes.  How can I go back to work if I'm wasting away under this torment? You don't know what I've been through these last weeks.  I got myself a revolver. You don't believe me, but I did, I did! I stood in front of that mirror, only I couldn't make myself.  It wouldn't be 
NORMA (Cont'd) fair to all those people who are waiting to see me back on the screen.  I can't disappoint them. Only, if I'm to work, I need sleep, I need quiet, I need you! Don't just stand there hating me! Shout at me, strike me! But don't hate me, Joe.  Don't you hear me, Joe? 
GILLIS Yes, I hear you.  And I wish you'd keep still so I can hear the doorbell when she rings it.

{"test1_input": "BATTLE: LOS ANGELES \nWritten by \nChris Bertolini \nFADE IN: FROM SPACE, a view of the EARTH. The vibrant BLUE of its OCEANS is striking against the vast BLACK VOID of space. MOVE CLOSER TO THE EARTH, where the shimmering PACIFIC OCEAN meets the CALIFORNIA COASTLINE... A bird's-eye view of LOS ANGELES comes into relief-- a criss- cross of streets, freeways. The buildings not more than dots. Keep MOVING CLOSER as SOUND FADES IN. We notice MOVEMENT through the sprawl of city now: MASSES OF PEOPLE and CARS moving AWAY FROM THE OCEAN as we arrive at... \nEXT. PICO BLVD. - GROUND-LEVEL - DAY \nThe SOUND is at a frantic pitch here-- The sound of CHAOS on the streets. People SCREAMING, CAR HORNS BLARING as CARS jockey for position, moving eastward among... HORDES OF PEOPLE on foot, their PANICKED FACES rushing past. SUPER: LOS ANGELES-- CONTACT + 1 HOUR as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. 1ST SERGEANT'S OFFICE / CAMP PENDLETON - DAY \nSUPER: MARINE CORPS BASE, CAMP PENDLETON. OCEANSIDE, CA. Then SUPER: THE DAY BEFORE... We are CLOSE ON: SERGEANT MICHAEL NANTZ late 30s, tall, battle-hardened, staring forward, listening impatiently. \n1ST SGT. ROY (O.S.) Must be some kind of mistake... Company 1st SERGEANT JOHN ROY, also late 30s, sits behind his desk, holding Nantz' file. Smiles. \n1ST SGT. ROY I got paperwork here, with your signature, says you're retiring. \nSGT. NANTZ No mistake, John. \n1ST SGT. ROY My ass. You got a box full a', medals, file full a' commendations. \n(MORE) \n1ST SGT. ROY (cont'd) Hell, everything but the Good Conduct. \nSGT. NANTZ They can take the Good Conduct Medal and shove it up their... \n1ST SGT. ROY \n(LAUGHS) See, that's what I'm talking about, Mike. You're a marine! Nantzsmiles back now. \nSGT. NANTZ I appreciate it, John. You know that. But, I been to too many funerals. Had to visit too many moms and dads, tell 'em about what happened to their sons... \nBEAT. \n1ST SGT. ROY Look. You're on that training assignment right now. Why don't you just ride it out for a month or two. See how you feel... \nSGT. NANTZ I did my twenty. I'm done. Roy takes this in, nods. He stands, holds his hand out. \n1ST SGT. ROY You're gonna miss it. Nantz shakes. \nSGT. NANTZ Wanna bet? \nCUT TO: \nTHE GREEN WASH OF NIGHT VISION GOGGLES Looking out onto ROLLING HILLS and TREES... We hear (O.S.) : \n", "test1_true": "VOICE #2 (O.S.) I'm telling you, it's in the trees. \nFIVE MARINES From the 1st Platoon, 2nd battalion, 5th Marines (the 2/5).. Camo uniforms, NIGHT VISION GOGGLES on, stare into the DARK. CPL. CORREGGIO, 20, linebacker-big, shakes his head, frustrated. \nCPL. CORREGGIO Screw it. I'm gonna launch another one... The other marines back away quickly as... WIDEN to see we're... \nEXT. OFFICER'S GOLF COURSE / CAMP PENDLETON - NIGHT \nCorreggio, GOLF CLUB in hand, steps to a golf tee. WHACK. He tees off. The marines follow the ball as it sails into the darkness. \nCPL. CORREGGIO - That's more like it. PVT. LENIHAN, 18, baby-faced, looks impressed. \nPVT. LENIHAN Sweet. PVT. IMLAY, 19, a dense but good-natured country boy, moves to the tee. \nPVT. IMLAY Don't encourage him. Correggio's freakin' ego's big enough already. He takes the club from Correggio. \nPVT. IMLAY Let an expert show you how it's done, bro. Imlay TEES OFF, his swing plainly choppy, uncoordinated. \nPOV THROUGH IMLAY'S NIGHT VISION GOGGLES As he WHACKS THE BALL, visible in the night vision's greenish glow. It HOOKS into a sand trap. \nPVT. IMLAY (O.S.) Mother fu... \nThen he stops as a LIGHT flashes beyond the trees. \nPVT. IMLAY Foot mobiles. 3 O'clock. \nCPL. CORREGGIO Told you they'd come! THREE GIRLS, 19-21, signal with a FLASHLIGHT. Then race down a small hill onto the golf course. \nEXT. GOLF COURSE - LATER \nThe THREE GIRLS sit around a beat-up TAHOE parked near the tee, CASE OF BEER on its back gate, sipping beers. Corpsman ADUKWU, 20, a tall, thin Nigerian, TEES OFF. \nPVT. IMLAY That dog'll hunt! Damn, Daktari, you can play! \nADUKWU \n(THICK ACCENT) We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay. \nPVT. IMLAY Well, how would I know? I mean, it's an American game. \nPVT. LENIHAN Actually, Imlay, it's Scottish. PVT. KERNS, 19, an antsy fireplug of a guy, shakes his head. \nPVT. KERNS Lenihan, you as good with an M-16 as you are with your mouth? \nPVT. IMLAY Kerns. Lay off him. \nPVT. KERNS What? Just wanna make sure the rookie won't fold under fire. Correggio shoves a beer into Kerns' hand. \nCPL. CORREGGIO Relax, dude. He throws an arm around Kerns' shoulder, smiles at the girls. \n", "test1_id": 1680, "test2_input": "PVT. SIMMONS Where'd they come from?! Why'd they come here?! \nLT. MARTINEZ Everyone... just calm down. \nPVT. SIMMONS Calm down?! We keep shooting them... Why don't they die?! \nSGT. NANTZ Stow that shit, Private. (turns, to the others) Watch the yard. Secure the back. We're not dyin' here today. The marines take up firing positions at windows and doors. \nCORREGGIO EYES KERNS. \nCPL. CORREGGIO You okay? Kerns stares back, deer in the headlights. He nods. ADUKWU IS WRAPPING GRAYSTON'S ARM as Grayston fumbles for a CIGARETTE. Adukwu lights it for him. \nCPL. GRAYSTON I know. These things'll kill me. Adukwu smiles. Grayston stares at his arm, ironically: \nCPL. GRAYSTON Hell, now that just ain't fair. Nantz moves to Martinez, who is staring down at the wounded Grayston and Guerrero. \nSGT. NANTZ Sir, what are your orders? Martinez turns, stares at Nantz. \nLT. MARTINEZ I led us right into that ambush. \nSGT. NANTZ Sir. Your orders. Beat. Martinez nods. \nLT. MARTINEZ Let's figure out how we get out of here. We'll medevac the wounded from that park. \nNantz nods, turns to Mottola. \nSGT. NANTZ Radio the FOB. Get us a medevac at that park by the community center. As Mottola works the radio, he's startled to see Guerrero, who has been SLASHED across both eyes. \nPVT. GUERRERO I can't see, Motorola. Mottola, horrified, steadies his voice. \nPVT. MOTTOLA You'll be okay. A slight beat. Then... \nPVT. GUERRERO You're one shitty liar, bro. \nPVT. IMLAY Hey, where the hell is Lenihan?! Everyone stops, stares. \nEXT. BACK YARD OF DIFFERENT HOUSE - SAME \nLenihan, pressing a hand into his side, BLOOD oozing between his fingers, peers INTO THE BACK YARD at... A SWIMMING POOL, its water gently lapping. A GARAGE nearby. Lenihan, startled by the SOUND of ALIENS RUNNING in the alley behind the house, takes cover BY THE GARAGE. He struggles to remain calm. Then the sound FADES. He waits. Silence. Lenihan starts to edge,out as... A BANG rings out on the far side of the garage. Lenihan spins back behind cover, eyes desperately searching. \nINT. HOUSE - SAME \nNantz shoulders his M-16. Martinez eyes him. \nSGT. NANTZ I'll go for Lenihan, sir. \nLT. MARTINEZ All right. We'll package the wounded, then rally on 10th street. \n(TURNS) Mottola, Imlay. Go with the sergeant. The two quickly step to Nantz. \nPVT. IMLAY We got your six, Sergeant. Anything you need. \n", "test2_true": "PVT. IMLAY Right. Got it. Quiet. \nSGT. NANTZ Starting now, Private. As Nantz turns, Mottola slaps Imlay in the helmet. \nINT. BACK YARD OF DIFFERENT HOUSE \nLenihan creeps around the garage, spies a SIDE DOOR leading into it. He grabs the handle. Mercifully, the door opens. \nINT. DARK GARAGE - CONTINUOUS \nLenihan falls INTO THE DARK GARAGE. Boxes and old furniture. Just one dirt-stained WINDOW on an opposite wall. Lenihan crouches in the dim light, coughs, spitting up blood. He turns on his radio, says into it: \nPVT. LENIHAN Motorola? You copy? His RADIO buzzes back with Nantz' voice: \nSGT. NANTZ (V.0.) Lenihan. This is Sgt. Nantz... \nPVT. LENIHAN Sergeant, Jesus, I had to turn the radio off..'. These things are everywhere! \nEXT. ALLEY - SAME \nNantz is MOVING, with Mottola and Imlay. covering. \nSGT. NANTZ \n(INTO RADIO) We're coming for you, Lenihan. What's your location? \nINT. GARAGE - SAME \nLenihan looks across the garage, out of the window... \nPVT. LENIHAN I'm in a garage... I can see two palm trees right next to it. House is white with black shutters... Just as something BANGS against the garage. \nSGT. NANTZ (V.0.) Is the house a two-story? Lenihan stares, his eyes going wide, panicked. \nSGT. NANTZ (V.O.) Lenihan, is the house a...? Lenihan CLICKS the radio OFF. Then waits, very still, listening, M-16 held tightly. His breathing turns shallow-- from loss of blood and from fear. Lenihan sees the BRANCHES of a bush SWAYING outside the window, as if something just brushed past it. \nEXT. STREET - SAME \nNantz, Mottola and Imlay moving through the thick smoke... Nantz still trying to raise Lenihan on the radio. \nSGT. NANTZ Lenihan...? Lenihan...? Imlay taps Nantz on the shoulder, motions to his ears. He hears something... The marines freeze, Nantz clicking the radio off as... Nearby, they hear SOUNDS of aliens running... Somewhere... \nThe marines crouch, weapons up, straining to see through the smoke. They remain stock still. Then... The sound fades into the distance. Nantz looks at the men. Motions. They creep forward as... \nINT. GARAGE - SAME \nLenihan moves TO THE WINDOW, searching the garage floor, desperate not to step on anything that would make noise. He edges forward to peer through the dirty glass. Then... THUD THUD THUD. More NOISES... On the garage roof now. Lenihan looks up, panicked as... CRASH! The WINDOW suddenly CRASHES IN. Lenihan spins, FIRING wildly, lighting up the garage as... He stumbles to the door, fumbling for the handle, falling... \nEXT. BACK YARD OF HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \n", "test2_id": 1681, "test3_input": "LT. MARTINEZ This thing's still alive! Nantz pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE, thrusting it DEEP INTO THE ORGAN, twisting viciously. \nThe organ stops vibrating. The glow fades. The body slumps. \nSGT. NANTZ Not so hard to kill when you know where to aim. Mottola appears in the room, a sense of controlled panic. \nPVT. MOTTOLA Lieutenant. There's a breach. \nINT. HALLWAY / COMMUNITY CENTER - SECONDS LATER \nThe marines step from the side room with Michele. They peer up and down the dark hallway, listening... OTHER DOORS along the hall take on an ominous presence now. \nSGT. NANTZ \n(LOW) They in the building? \nPVT. MOTTOLA No clue, Sergeant. An exterior door was broken open. \nSGT. NANTZ Lieutenant. Maybe we should gather the civilians in the gym. \nLT. MARTINEZ Good idea, Sergeant. \nINT. / EXT. BUS - SAME \nStavrou, still beneath the wheel. Harris, eyes on the street as the RADIO crackles with Correggio's VOICE: \nCPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.) Harris, hostiles advancing right at you. Approximately two hundred meters and closing... \nCPL. STAVROU Done! Stavrou hops into the driver's seat, tries to start the bus. It doesn't turn over. Harris and Stavrou exchange a quick glance. Stavrou drops below the wheel again... \nINT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nMore ominous BANGS ring out from down the long hallway, BUILDING in intensity. Nantz stands, staring DOWN THE DARK HALL with his M-16, surprised as Martinez steps up next to him. \nLT. MARTINEZ We're in it together, Sergeant. Martinez slams a grenade into his launcher now. \nLT. MARTINEZ C'mon, Mottola. Get that bus here! Mottola is on the radio, frantic: \nPVT. MOTTOLA Where the hell is that bus?! \nINT. BUS - SAME \nStavrou is still underneath the wheel. Harris looks out to see ALIENS rounding the corner in the distance. \nCPL. HARRIS Get this thing started. \nCPL. STAVROU Hey, why didn't I think a' that? \nINT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - SAME \nCRACK! Down the hall, the sound of a door splintering... \n", "test3_true": "LT. MARTINEZ Go! Get 'em out! Imlay swings the GYM DOOR OPEN, moving the civilians out. \nIN THE LOBBY Nantz and Martinez stand together, aiming at the hall as... A final BANG... We hear a door being BURST OPEN. \nNantz, in the front, exchanges a glance with Martinez at the ominous sight of... A PLUME OF BLACK SMOKE rising in the distance. \nTHEY SPIN ONTO LINCOLN BOULEVARD. Screech to a halt at the obstacle course of BATTLE WRECKAGE strewn across the street. Noxious BLACK SMOKE is rising from BURNING HUMVEES and TRUCKS. Smoking CRATERS pothole the street. \nLT. MARTINEZ \n(SHOCKED) Jesus Christ. Those alien ships took the whole line out. \nSGT. NANTZ We've got forty minutes 'til they level this area. \nLT. MARTINEZ \n(TO STAVROU) Get us to the Forward Operating Base. Fast. Stavrou lays on the gas, speeding away as, in the back, the other marines stare out. Mottola peers into the sky...' \nPVT. MOTTOLA Where the hell are all our jets? \nEXT. BUS (MOVING) - SIDE STREETS, SANTA MONICA \nThe bus snakes through jammed streets, abandoned cars, bombed out buildings. \nINT. BUS -SAME \nMartinez is in the front with Stavrou, Nantz in the middle of the bus, hovering near the civilians sitting on the floor. Rincon holds Hector, Michele with her arms around both girls. Marines on the seats above, weapons ready. Nantz hears Imlay whispering to Harris: \nPVT. IMLAY Why the hell'd the lieutenant wanna take a bus? We're sittin' ducks. \nSGT. NANTZ (low, hard) The call's been made, private. You so eager to decide the fate of all these people? Imlay is stone silent. \nSGT. NANTZ Didn't think so. Then Nantz looks up, meeting eyes with Martinez as... A NOISE in the distance now. A low VIBRATION, building. Nantz moves to Martinez. They peer out of the front. LIGHTS fill the sky, heading east. As they approach... The VIBRATION gets louder and louder, shaking the bus now. \nSGT. NANTZ Everybody get down, weapons inside the bus. Make no noise. The men pull their guns in from the windows, crouching as low as possible, straining to see, hear... The vibrations grow louder, LOUDER! Suddenly... WHOOSH! An ALIEN AIRCRAFT rips overhead. Then another, and another, and another... All heading east. The image of their speed, their power, their other- worldliness is overwhelming, devastating. Nantz stares, relief flooding his face, as the armada flies on. Leaving them behind. Until... Suddenly, Mottola's RADIO BLARES! \nCOMMAND \n(FROM RADIO) All stations this net, urgent traffic. Multiple enemy aircraft moving east... As the transmission rings out, Nantz looks up to see... One ALIEN SHIP split from the armada, TURN BACK TO THE BUS. \nLT. MARTINEZ It's coming back...! The children scream, marines agitated... all hear a low vibration, echoing off buildings, heading their way. \nSGT. NANTZ (staring at the radio, \nREALIZING) Kill that radio! Mottola turns off the radio. The alien aircraft STOPS. Hovers a moment. \nSGT. NANTZ They're tracking our signals! All radios, cell phones-- keep everything off! Everyone stares silently, tensely. Then... A single BEAM OF LIGHT suddenly shines from the alien craft. Then the alien aircraft MOVES FORWARD again. Slowly. But still heading their way. \nLT. MARTINEZ It's still coming... It's searching... Nantz grabs a PORTABLE RADIO. He looks around the bus, sees the little girl, Kirsten, ponytail in her hair. He leans down to her. \n", "test3_id": 1682}

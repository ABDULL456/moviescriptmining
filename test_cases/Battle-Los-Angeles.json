{"train": "BATTLE: LOS ANGELES \nWritten by \nChris Bertolini \nFADE IN: FROM SPACE, a view of the EARTH. The vibrant BLUE of its OCEANS is striking against the vast BLACK VOID of space. MOVE CLOSER TO THE EARTH, where the shimmering PACIFIC OCEAN meets the CALIFORNIA COASTLINE... A bird's-eye view of LOS ANGELES comes into relief-- a criss- cross of streets, freeways. The buildings not more than dots. Keep MOVING CLOSER as SOUND FADES IN. We notice MOVEMENT through the sprawl of city now: MASSES OF PEOPLE and CARS moving AWAY FROM THE OCEAN as we arrive at... \nEXT. PICO BLVD. - GROUND-LEVEL - DAY \nThe SOUND is at a frantic pitch here-- The sound of CHAOS on the streets. People SCREAMING, CAR HORNS BLARING as CARS jockey for position, moving eastward among... HORDES OF PEOPLE on foot, their PANICKED FACES rushing past. SUPER: LOS ANGELES-- CONTACT + 1 HOUR as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. 1ST SERGEANT'S OFFICE / CAMP PENDLETON - DAY \nSUPER: MARINE CORPS BASE, CAMP PENDLETON. OCEANSIDE, CA. Then SUPER: THE DAY BEFORE... We are CLOSE ON: SERGEANT MICHAEL NANTZ late 30s, tall, battle-hardened, staring forward, listening impatiently. \n1ST SGT. ROY (O.S.) Must be some kind of mistake... Company 1st SERGEANT JOHN ROY, also late 30s, sits behind his desk, holding Nantz' file. Smiles. \n1ST SGT. ROY I got paperwork here, with your signature, says you're retiring. \nSGT. NANTZ No mistake, John. \n1ST SGT. ROY My ass. You got a box full a', medals, file full a' commendations. \n(MORE) \n1ST SGT. ROY (cont'd) Hell, everything but the Good Conduct. \nSGT. NANTZ They can take the Good Conduct Medal and shove it up their... \n1ST SGT. ROY \n(LAUGHS) See, that's what I'm talking about, Mike. You're a marine! Nantzsmiles back now. \nSGT. NANTZ I appreciate it, John. You know that. But, I been to too many funerals. Had to visit too many moms and dads, tell 'em about what happened to their sons... \nBEAT. \n1ST SGT. ROY Look. You're on that training assignment right now. Why don't you just ride it out for a month or two. See how you feel... \nSGT. NANTZ I did my twenty. I'm done. Roy takes this in, nods. He stands, holds his hand out. \n1ST SGT. ROY You're gonna miss it. Nantz shakes. \nSGT. NANTZ Wanna bet? \nCUT TO: \nTHE GREEN WASH OF NIGHT VISION GOGGLES Looking out onto ROLLING HILLS and TREES... We hear (O.S.) : \nCPL. CORREGGIO My buddy's jumpy 'cause he got an assfull a' shrapnel our last tour. \nPVT. KERNS I'm jumpy? You're crawling up your own ass 'cause we train with Sgt. Nantz tomorrow. Correggio eyes Kerns. This was the wrong thing to say. One girl, smiling seductively, steps to Correggio, takes the golf club.from him. \nGIRL #1 If this is the officer's course, what happens if they catch you out here? She readies to take a shot. Correggio snuggles up behind her, ostensibly teaching her how to swing. \nCPL. CORREGGIO We can handle it, baby. We're experts at night maneuvers. Nearby, the SECOND GIRL chats up Adukwu. \nGIRL #2 So you're from where again? Imlay pops a beer, interrupting. \nPVT. IMLAY Nigeria. Adukwu's our corpsman. Like a medic. Saved Kerns' ass. \n(TO ADUKWU) Daktari, tell her about Nigeria. Adukwu starts to talk, but Imlay interrupts again: \nPVT. IMLAY Adukwu's a green card marine... (motions to Lenihan) And Lenihan here-- He's just green. Mom signed so he could join at 17. I'm looking after him since he don't know his ass from a hot rock. Lenihan suddenly ducks behind the Tahoe, throwing up. \nGIRL #3 You're doing a good job. \nPVT. IMLAY Yeah. We always take the new meat out here to christen 'em... Lenihan shuffles back out from behind the Tahoe. \nPVT. IMLAY Hey, barfy. Grab your beer. toast. Everyone holds beers aloft. Lenihan joins in reluctantly. \nPVT. IMLAY To Lenihan. Who gets his first taste a' those hills tomorrow. He points off to the HILLY, DESOLATE TERRAIN near the course. \nPVT. KERNS Good luck, rookie. The marines chuckle knowingly, about to drink... Then they hear the sound of TIRES skidding to a halt. They look toward the hillside, see the WHITE HELMETS'of MPs. \nCPL. CORREGGIO MPs! The marines grab the goggles and clubs, pile... \nINTO THE TAHOE With the girls. The Tahoe skids away, the beer CRASHING off' the back. The first girl eyes Correggio. \nGIRL #1 Experts, huh? Correggio grins sheepishly. She smiles. sweetly, taking his hand, writing her PHONE NUMBER on the back of it as... \nINT. BEDROOM / OFF-BASE APARTMENT - SAN CLEMENTE - MORNING \nA modest working-class two bedroom apartment. A TELEVISION on in the b.g.. A NEWS PROGRAM: \nNEWSCASTER (ON TV) .what appears to be an unprecedented meteor shower, falling off the Falkland Islands. \nLT. BENNIE MARTINEZ, 25, whose youthful looks and open smile contrast with his muscular frame, rolls in bed to see... His wife, ANNA, 24, sitting on the edge of the bed next to him, turning something over in her hands. \nLT. MARTINEZ What are you doing up so early? She holds up the object in her hands-- It's Martinez' \nLIEUTENANT BARS. \nANNA \n(OBVIOUSLY PROUD) Lieutenant. I still have to get used to that. She kisses him lightly, stands. Martinez smiles, watching her move off. \nLT. MARTINEZ Yeah, lot of things we gotta get used to. We see her VERY PREGNANT BELLY now as she smiles back, exits. As she does, Martinez turns back to the TELEVISION: 'METEORS' falling into a distant ocean. \nNEWSCASTER (V.0.) This dazzling display is visible from Argentina to Southern Chile. \nSGT. NANTZ Dying's easy, ladies. Everything else takes balls. Nantz spits on the ground. \nSGT. NANTZ Adukwu. Run a bag of saline into Lenihan and tape that ankle. We start back in ten minutes. \nINT. FLOWER SHOP DAY \nWe recognize two marines from 1st platoon: CPL. DEVREY HARRIS, 22, African-American, steely, quick-witted, and CPL. NICK STAVROU, 23, a Greek hulk with an easy smile. Harris stares at a TELEVISION on a table behind the counter. \nNEWSCASTER (V.0.) .meteors are falling off the coasts of California, Ireland, India, in the Bay of Bengal-- all less than ten miles from land... \nCPL. STAVROU Man, I thought Lenihan was gonna wash out today. \nCPL. HARRIS Hey, I remember carrying your fat ass up that hill hung over as shit. Newbie gets no sympathy from me. \nA woman, CHERISE, 22, Harris' fiancee, hurries over. \nCHERISE For three hundred more, she said we could have sprays of lilies. I know it's a lot, but it'd be so beautiful. What d'you think, baby? Harris looks pained. But before he can speak up: \nCPL. STAVROU Well, I think it's a no-brainer. You're only getting married once! What, are you gonna worry about three hundred bucks? Cherise looks expectantly to Harris, who smiles back weakly. \nCPL. HARRIS Of course, baby. Whatever you want She kisses him, heads to the florist as Harris turns on \nSTAVROU: \nCPL. HARRIS Dude, what are you doing? \nCPL. STAVROU Busting your balls. \nCHERISE \n(CALLS OVER) Tomorrow we shop for cake. Stavrou throws an arm round Harris' shoulder, smiles. \nCPL. STAVROU I love cake. \nINT. CAMP PENDLETON / PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nA drab, nondescript office. Kerns sits across a desk from the BASE PSYCHIATRIST, who's consulting a FILE. \nPSYCHIATRIST Still not sleeping... And the nightmares? \nPVT. KERNS No. I mean, sometimes. But it's no big deal. \nPSYCHIATRIST You're not drinking, right, private? That's just a crutch... \nPVT. KERNS Alcohol? No, sir. Definitely not. The psychiatrist stares at this. Then WRITES in the file. \nPVT. KERNS So... What's my status? Am I cleared for combat? I feel good. \nPSYCHIATRIST \n(STILL WRITING) Let's meet again next week. \nINT. DORM ROOM - BACHELOR ENLISTED QUARTERS - SAME \nLenihan and Imlay, Correggio and Kerns are getting their gear together, hurriedly packing. Lenihan checks and double checks a LIST with the contents of his pack, ticking off 'poncho liner,' 'gore-tex jacket,' 'socks,' 'vest,' 'first aid kit,' flashlight'... \nPVT. KERNS It's probably just a drill, right? \nPVT. IMLAY They shifted Nantz into our unit. Something must be going on. \nPVT. LENIHAN I heard Nantz kicked ass on his last tour. Went into a compound by himself, killed, like, ten insurgents... \nCPL. CORREGGIO That what you heard? You don't know shit, Lenihan. Correggio, pissed, grabs his pack, heads for the door. \nCPL. CORREGGIO Move your asses. They want us in the armory. And he's gone. Lenihan, confused, looks at Imlay. \nPVT. LENIHAN What's his problem? \nPVT. IMLAY Nantz lost a lotta guys on that tour. Correggio's brother was one of 'em. Lenihan nods, somber, getting it. \nINT. HALLWAY / BASE COMMAND BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER \nNantz and Martinez walk through quickly. All around them, NUMEROUS OFFICERS hurry, all responding to RINGING BEEPERS. Nantz peers into VARIOUS OFFICES. Every one is buzzing with activity: Clerks bustling, maps spread out, phones ringing. \nAnd every office has a TELEVISION on. We hear OVERLAPPING. REPORTER'S VOICES from the offices they pass: \nTV REPORTERS (V.0.) .cluster of what appears to be meteors is tightly packed... hard for scientists to predict the size or quantity striking the oceans... \nSGT. NANTZ They calling us.in because of these meteors, Lieutenant? \nLT. MARTINEZ I assume so... Maybe an evacuation. Whatever it is, it'll be good to get out in the field with the men. Nantz looks askance at this. Martinez catches it. \nLT. MARTINEZ Look, Sergeant, let's be clear. I know your rep, know what you've done... But this is my unit. We're not gonna have a problem, are we? \nSGT. NANTZ No problem, sir. It's all yours. \nINT. ARMORY - DAY \nAt numerous windows,. LINES OF MARINES hand in weapons cards, receiving their weapons in return. Among them... The marines from 1st Platoon of the 2/5 (Correggio and Kerns, Stavrou and Harris, Imlay and Lenihan, Adukwu), all watching: MOUNTED TELEVISIONS-- A WOMAN REPORTER, 20s, on a BEACH. Behind her, POLICE disperse thin CROWDS of PEOPLE, bullhorns blaring. A legend on the TV screen reads 'SANTA MONICA, CA.' PVT. MOTTOLA, squad radio man, tall and thin, listening to an IPOD, and PVT. GUERRERO, lumbering, eyes on the TV. \nPVT. MOTTOLA We never got a chance to finish the new mix, man. We were gonna add some metal to it... \nPVT. GUERRERO We'll have time later. \nThe marines stare at the harried reporter on TV. \nREPORTER (ON TV) .National Guard troops have flown in to evacuate all surrounding beach areas... \nPVT. MOTTOLA \n(TREPIDATION) Yeah... Later. \nINT. BRIEFING ROOM / CAMP PENDLETON - LATER \nEXT. CAMP PENDLETON AIR FIELD - MINUTES LATER \nAll activity has doubled, a frantic energy now. TRUCKS race along the perimeter of the air field, massive CH-46 HELICOPTERS TAKE OFF loaded with MARINE UNITS... The 1st platoon stands together, Lt. Martinez addressing them as ANOTHER CH-46 HELICOPTER is landing nearby. \nLT. MARTINEZ As you probably heard, Sgt. Nantz will be taking over for Sgt. Beck. We're lucky to have him aboard. The CH-46 helicopters TOUCHES DOWN now, its massive,, bay door opening for them. Martinez barks: \nLT. MARTINEZ Let's move, men!, The platoon grabs gear, runs for the helicopter, climbing aboard. Nantz hurries them along, grabbing packs, throwing them on after the marines. Then he grabs Correggio's pack, about to throw the pack on... Correggio grabs it back from Nantz. Nantz turns, faces off with Correggio. \nSGT. NANTZ You got something to get off your chest, Corporal? \nCPL. CORREGGIO No. It's cool, Sergeant. You got a Silver Star and my brother came home in a box. I get it. Beat. \nSGT. NANTZ Get aboard, Corporal. Correggio jumps into the chopper. \nINT. CH-46 TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - LATER \nIN FLIGHT. The marines, helmets on, packs between their knees, sit facing each other. The sound of the CH-46's massive rotors is deafening. Some shout over the din, too nervous to remain quiet. \nPVT. GUERRERO What the hell you think those things are? \nCPL. HARRIS Gotta be extraterrestrial. \nPVT. IMLAY You mean, like, from space?! \nCPL. STAVROU No, Imlay. From Canada. Correggio looks down at his hand... Sees the GIRL'S PHONE NUMBER written on it. ACROSS THE DECK, Martinez huddles with Nantz, MAP in hand. \nLT. MARTINEZ Santa Monica airport's our Forward Operating Base. We get some Cobras and F-18s in the air, we'll have plenty of support. Nantz nods. They're flying into the unknown and Martinez seems as nervous as the younger men. Kerns leans in to Nantz, desperately needing reassurance. \nPVT. KERNS How many a' them you think there are, Sergeant? Nantz just stares out, stone-faced. \nSGT. NANTZ We'll know soon enough, private. \nINT. CH-46 TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - LATER \nThe marines are glued to the windows, shocked by what they're seeing as the chopper BANKS toward Venice/Santa Monica: FIRES raging from various explosions. In the distance, MASSIVE LINES of TRAFFIC moving away from the ocean. The STREETS bordering the beach look deserted-- Except for the BODIES dotting the landscape. Nantz looks at Martinez, who is hunched over, scribbling a LETTER. Martinez folds it, then writes the name ANNA on it. We realize it's a letter in the event of his death. Martinez stares at the letter. Then carefully tucks it away. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/FORWARD OPERATING BASE - LATER \nThe airport is being quickly transformed into a military base: MILITARY VEHICLES line the runway, more being driven from a nearby CARGO PLANE. The CH-46 LANDS. The platoon JUMPS OUT, squad leaders forming the men up as... Nantz and Martinez salute a CAPTAIN heading to them as F-18 JETS take off, screaming overhead. \nLT. MARTINEZ Lt. Martinez, sir. 1st Platoon of the 2/5. \nCAPTAIN Situation is as follows: Most of Santa Monica is cleared of civilians. We've got a defensive line at Lincoln Boulevard a mile from the ocean... He points out LINCOLN BOULEVARD on a MAP, the OCEAN close by. \nCAPTAIN At 9 p.m., everything from Lincoln to the ocean will be bombed. Martinez blanches. \nLT. MARTINEZ We're... leveling it, Captain? \nCAPTAIN We've got an infestation of god- knows-what. It's an enemy ground force only, they have no aircraft. So our jets'll tear 'em a new asshole. We will rule the air. \nPVT. IMLAY What the hell...? \nCPL. HARRIS Something spooked that dog... Then Kerns sees the SMOKE SWIRLING DOWN THE SIDE STREET... As if something is racing through it. Kerns breaks formation, SPRINTS DOWN THE SIDE STREET, FIRING. \nPVT. KERNS Contact! Contact! Discipline shatters as the squad follows Kerns... \nDOWN THE SIDE STREET. \nSGT. NANTZ Marines! Hold your position! Kerns stops, spinning, looking. for targets, breath ragged, eyes panicked. Correggio races up. \nCPL. CORREGGIO What'd you see?! Suddenly, the INDISTINCT FORM of an ALIEN CREATURE appears through the smoke, moving FAST down the side street. Kerns is ready, FIRING. The others react, FIRING as well. The ALIEN FORM is blasted, DROPPING into the smoke. \nLT. MARTINEZ Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Everyone stops firing. Nantz gets in Kerns' face. \nSGT. NANTZ One enemy runs and you break discipline and chase it?! (to the others) Think, marines. Stay alive. \nLT. MARTINEZ The sergeant is right. Stay on course. We have a mission... \nSuddenly, the SHADOWY ALIEN FORM RISES again, darting off, disappearing into the smoke. The squad stares back, stunned. \nCPL. STAVROU \n(QUIETLY) Holy shit. \nCPL. HARRIS How many rounds it take? \nCPL. STAVROU Enough. Correggio edges to Kerns, who's looking panicky. \nCPL. CORREGGIO You okay? \nPVT. KERNS They're real, bro. I kept prayin' they wouldn't be... \nSGT. NANTZ Quiet. Nantz, unnerved himself, stares into the smoke... \nLT. MARTINEZ What is it, sergeant? \nSGT. NANTZ That thing running down the street... That was to draw us in... Slowly, fading in, we hear what Nantz hears now... A RUMBLING SOUND BEHIND THEM. Building. Nantz spins to it. \nSGT. NANTZ They're coming. We took the bait, now they're cutting us off. \nPVT. KERNS I can't see a goddamn thing! But the SOUND of their ADVANCE tells us there's many. \nSGT. NANTZ Light it up! The squad lets loose with a barrage of FIRE as... \nTRACER FIRE shoots back at the marines from the smoke. Glimpses of INDISTINCT FIGURES moving fast. \nLT. MARTINEZ Mottola, get on the radio. See if we can get some air support. Mottola starts working the radio, trying to remain calm as.'.. PROJECTILES EXPLODE in BRIGHT FLASHES around the marines. \nPVT. SIMMONS Contact front! Contact front! Correggio, frustrated, peers through the smoke. \nCPL. CORREGGIO What are we shooting at?! \nPVT. SIMMONS Where'd they come from?! Why'd they come here?! \nLT. MARTINEZ Everyone... just calm down. \nPVT. SIMMONS Calm down?! We keep shooting them... Why don't they die?! \nSGT. NANTZ Stow that shit, Private. (turns, to the others) Watch the yard. Secure the back. We're not dyin' here today. The marines take up firing positions at windows and doors. \nCORREGGIO EYES KERNS. \nCPL. CORREGGIO You okay? Kerns stares back, deer in the headlights. He nods. ADUKWU IS WRAPPING GRAYSTON'S ARM as Grayston fumbles for a CIGARETTE. Adukwu lights it for him. \nCPL. GRAYSTON I know. These things'll kill me. Adukwu smiles. Grayston stares at his arm, ironically: \nCPL. GRAYSTON Hell, now that just ain't fair. Nantz moves to Martinez, who is staring down at the wounded Grayston and Guerrero. \nSGT. NANTZ Sir, what are your orders? Martinez turns, stares at Nantz. \nLT. MARTINEZ I led us right into that ambush. \nSGT. NANTZ Sir. Your orders. Beat. Martinez nods. \nLT. MARTINEZ Let's figure out how we get out of here. We'll medevac the wounded from that park. \nNantz nods, turns to Mottola. \nSGT. NANTZ Radio the FOB. Get us a medevac at that park by the community center. As Mottola works the radio, he's startled to see Guerrero, who has been SLASHED across both eyes. \nPVT. GUERRERO I can't see, Motorola. Mottola, horrified, steadies his voice. \nPVT. MOTTOLA You'll be okay. A slight beat. Then... \nPVT. GUERRERO You're one shitty liar, bro. \nPVT. IMLAY Hey, where the hell is Lenihan?! Everyone stops, stares. \nEXT. BACK YARD OF DIFFERENT HOUSE - SAME \nLenihan, pressing a hand into his side, BLOOD oozing between his fingers, peers INTO THE BACK YARD at... A SWIMMING POOL, its water gently lapping. A GARAGE nearby. Lenihan, startled by the SOUND of ALIENS RUNNING in the alley behind the house, takes cover BY THE GARAGE. He struggles to remain calm. Then the sound FADES. He waits. Silence. Lenihan starts to edge,out as... A BANG rings out on the far side of the garage. Lenihan spins back behind cover, eyes desperately searching. \nINT. HOUSE - SAME \nNantz shoulders his M-16. Martinez eyes him. \nSGT. NANTZ I'll go for Lenihan, sir. \nLT. MARTINEZ All right. We'll package the wounded, then rally on 10th street. \n(TURNS) Mottola, Imlay. Go with the sergeant. The two quickly step to Nantz. \nPVT. IMLAY We got your six, Sergeant. Anything you need. \n.OUT OF THE GARAGE. Lenihan staggers back, eyes darting along the garage roof, gun aimed. Nothing there. As Lenihan continues backing away, peering through the drifting smoke at the garage, he's unaware that BEHIND him... \nA SHADOWY ALIEN FORM IS RISING FROM THE POOL. Lenihan doesn't see it, but he senses it. He turns, FIRES... A SPLASH as the shadowy alien figure is blasted back INTO THE POOL, disappearing under the water. Quickly, nervously, he loads another mag, edging to the pool. He peers over the pool edge... An indiscernible DARK FORM lays on the bottom of the pool. Lenihan is transfixed a moment. Then he raises his rifle to punch more rounds into the thing as... WHOOOM! The creature launches OUT OF THE WATER! \nBLISTERING GUNFIRE! As Nantz, Mottola and Imlay burst into the yard. They fire, as does Lenihan. The fusillade of bullets tears the creature up. The marines STOP FIRING as the alien falls to the ground. They stare amazed at the 7 ft. tall ALIEN CORPSE... Rigid skeleton bursting out of its skin, some strange layer of machinery intertwined with its flesh. \nCPL. MOTTOLA Oh my God... What the hell are these things? \nPVT. IMLAY They're butt ugly, that's what they are. Nantz grabs onto Lenihan, noticing his wound. \nSGT. NANTZ We're gonna get you to the medevac, Private. \nPVT. LENIHAN Thank you, Sergeant. Thanks for coming for me. \nSGT. NANTZ But Lenihan... \nPVT. LENIHAN Yes, Sergeant? \nSGT. NANTZ Ever get separated from your unit again, I'll find you and shoot you myself. \nPVT. LENIHAN Yes, Sergeant. Imlay slings Lenihan's arm around his shoulder and they're instantly moving, RUNNING FROM THE YARD. \nEXT. SIDE STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nThe men meet up with the others. Adukwu and Kerns carrying Grayston on a litter, Simmons holding onto the blinded Guerrero, guiding him. \nLT. MARTINEZ All right, let's get to the community center... They head off, Simmons still supporting Guerrero as THWACK! An alien projectile slams INTO SIMMONS' THROAT. Choking, he CRUMPLES to the ground. Guerrero stands, blind, helpless. Panic. The marines spin, searching for targets. \nLT. MARTINEZ Move! Grab Simmons! Go, go! Stavrou hoists Simmons as the marines run off, FIRING to cover their retreat, as... The SILHOUETTES of DARK ALIEN FORMS are visible on distant rooftops, watching the rifle squad disappear down the street. \nEXT. STREET - LATER \nNantz, Martinez and the rest of the squad hustle silently through the street, supporting their wounded. They take cover behind cars, peering out to see... The PARK in the distance. A wide open FIELD with a COMMUNITY CENTER BUILDING on the far side. There are distant sounds of warfare, but the area here seems strangely quiet. Then, out of the smoke, an IMAGE APPEARS... Something MOVING \nAT THEM... The marines all shift, aim forward, about to blast away as... FOUR MARINES come into view, moving ghost-like. Nantz signals with his flashlight. The marines hurry over, silently falling behind the cars. \nLT. MARTINEZ You guys are 2/5? \nMARINE 2nd squad, 3rd platoon... \nLT. MARTINEZ Where's the rest of your unit? \nMARINE This is it, Lieutenant. Everyone else is dead or missing. The news hits Martinez hard. He eyes Nantz. \nMARINE We were on the street, like, ten minutes and they ambushed us. As soon as we radioed for help, it's like they were everywhere... \nPVT. MOTTOLA \n(ON RADIO) Medevac's incoming, lieutenant. \nLT. MARTINEZ All right. Stay with us. And the squad moves out... \nSpeeding toward Lincoln. FIRING PULSING WAVES OF ENERGY, lighting up the distant sky. \nINT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nThe marines and civilians fall into the large entryway. The marines are breathing hard, looking stunned. \nPVT. KERNS Goddamn flying saucers now...?! \nADUKWU All those guys on the chopper... \nPVT. IMLAY Why'd those bastards have to come down here and start this shit?! \nSGT. NANTZ That is not relevant, Imlay! They're here. They're trying to kill us. Kill them first! Martinez eyes Nantz on this. Then barks orders: \nLT. MARTINEZ Secure the perimeter! Stavrou, give me an ammo check. Cpl. Correggio, take three men, set up an Observation Post on the roof. \nSGT. NANTZ You heard the lieutenant. Move! The dazed marines begin COVERING doors and hallways. We see in their FACES that it's a very different fight now. Nantz turns, can see the MEDEVAC ABLAZE out a window. His solemn stare hints at a growing desperation. Martinez steps up to him, looks out. Quietly: \nLT. MARTINEZ They got air power, too... Knocked that medevac right out of the sky. So much for ruling the air. Nantz just keeps staring out. \nLT. MARTINEZ Listen, Sergeant. These men are scared. A little compassion would go a long way... Nantz turns on Martinez now. \nSGT. NANTZ How's that gonna help them survive, Lieutenant? \n(BEAT) I'll lead these marines. But don't ask me to get close to them. Nantz walks off. \nINT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - MINUTES LATER \nMarines on post, watching various windows and doors. Imlay kneels by the kids, who look devastated by the day's events. Imlay wets a rag with water from his canteen, wiping the dust and dirt from the kids' faces. The younger girl, KIRSTEN, 8, begins crying. She suddenly hugs Imlay. Imlay, startled by this, looks uncomfortable at first. Then hugs the little girl back, smiling at the older.girl, ANY, 10, Kirsten's sister. \nAMY You're not gonna leave us, are you? A beat. Then Imlay smiles. \nPVT. IMLAY No way, sweetheart. The woman, Michele McDermott, is clearly rattled, struggling for composure, eyes constantly moving to the kids. Mr. Rincon, a calm, watchful air about him, stands with his son, HECTOR, the kid who Nantz had carried to the chopper. \nRINCON My son and I came here... There were only three cops, spread pretty thin... Then those things attacked. Police couldn't stop them. \nSGT. NANTZ What happened to everyone? \nRINCON I don't know. Most people ran. We hid in a side room, found Michele and the girls... Couldn't see what happened. Just heard... Screams. \nMICHELE I have my nieces for the week. My sister and her husband are in Hawaii for their anniversary... Is it safe there? I heard this is happening in other places... Martinez is at a loss for words. \nMICHELE What do they want from us? Why are they here? \nLT. MARTINEZ I...don't know. Right now, our job is just to get you to safety, okay? Harris appears from the hallway. \nCPL. HARRIS Lieutenant, something you should see... \nEXT. COMMUNITY CENTER / BACK DOOR - MOMENTS LATER \nThe door opens. Nantz and Martinez edge out with Harris. As they peer into the smoke drifting past the building, an IMAGE becomes clear... An ALIEN BODY. On the ground nearby. Ripped by bullets. They step to it cautiously, realizing... IT'S NOT QUITE DEAD! The alien MOVES, turning as if to stare back at them. Without a word, Nantz lifts his rifle, shoots it in the head. \nSGT. NANTZ Hi. Could I have your, uh, hair thing? She stares, wide-eyed, at this fearsome, sweating marine. \nKIRSTEN My... pony holder? Nantz nods. She pulls the PONY TAIL HOLDER from her hair, hands it to Nantz. He smiles. Briefly. Heads to the front. \nSGT. NANTZ Anything happens, Lieutenant, get the SAWS up front and take off with these kids. \nLT. MARTINEZ Sergeant... \nBUT NANTZ IS OUT OF THE BUS. \nEXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS \nNantz runs down the street with the radio under his arm. Heading toward a GAS STATION. Nantz glances back, sees... The ALIEN AIRCRAFT SEARCHING the street below, getting closer and closer to the bus as... \nINT. BUS (STOPPED) - CONTINUOUS \nAmy and Kirsten pressed under seats, Michele covering them up... Hector closing his eyes in his dad's arms... The marines duck low, gripping their weapons. They hear the aircraft coming closer, almost above them. LIGHT starts shining through the windows as... \nEXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS \nNantz, almost to the gas station, wraps the pony tail holder around the radio, looks back to see. The ALIEN AIRCRAFT STOP, HOVERING OVER THE BUS! Shining lights into it, scanning, scanning... \nINT. BUS - CONTINUOUS \nHector's eyes widen, staring up at the light. Michele pulls the girls in closer, trying to calm them, herself. \nMICHELE \n(WHISPERING) It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay, it's all gonna be okay. Everyone freezes as the BEAM reflects off the walls, filling the space with a horrible bright light, exposing them as... \nEXT. STREET BY GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS \nNantz presses the \"Push to Talk\" button on the radio as... The alien craft suddenly TURNS in NANTZ' DIRECTION. Nantz wraps the pony tail holder around the radio, keeping the button on it depressed so it's SENDING A CONSTANT SIGNAL. He slides the radio toward one of the GAS PUMPS... Keeps moving, diving BEHIND A VAN across the street. Nantz peers around it, sees... The alien aircraft HEADING FOR THE GAS STATION, descending. Nantz slams a grenade into the launcher on his M-16. The alien aircraft zooms at the gas pumps, its unearthly hum growing louder and louder as... \nNANTZ FIRES THE GRENADE. The GAS PUMP EXPLODES! A MASSIVE FIREBALL HITS THE ALIEN \nCRAFT! Nantz flattens himself to the street as... The ALIEN AIRCRAFT, trailing smoke and flames, thunders out of control RIGHT OVER HIM... Then CRASHES into a building... BLOWING APART! \nINT. BUS (STOPPED) - CONTINUOUS \nMarines ducking, civilians screaming as... DEBRIS from the alien ship BLOWS OVER THE BUS, burning pieces falling to the ground... \nEXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS \nNantz runs out from behind the van, checks the remains of the burning alien aircraft, rifle raised. NO ALIEN inside. The ship is a DRONE. Nantz takes this in, then starts back for the bus. \nINT. BUS (STOPPED) - SAME \nNantz runs back onto the bus as Stavrou pulls swiftly away. \nSGT. NANTZ \nHECTOR (looks up at Nantz) Are we gonna die? Nantz turns back to Hector. Manages a smile. \nSGT. NANTZ Course not, kid, we're the good guys. And Nantz is off the bus. \nEXT. BUS ROOF \nImlay and Harris, prone, propped on their elbows, Imlay scanning through binoculars, sees... 30-40 ALIEN FIGHTERS coming their way. \nPVT. IMLAY I got about three dozen hostiles, twelve o'clock. 300 meters now. Coming fast. \nEXT. 10 FREEWAY - SAME \nNantz stands with Martinez at the concrete barrier. Nantz' scans the marines' positions. \nSGT. NANTZ Prepare to repel. Fix bayonets! This might get up-close and personal! Just a low CLATTERING now, the battle-rattle of Nantz and his men fixing BAYONETS to their rifles. Nantz-yells out: \nSGT. NANTZ Cpl. Harris! \nCPL. HARRIS Sir! \nSGT. NANTZ Being vastly outnumbered provides a marine rifleman with what? \nCPL. HARRIS A target rich environment, sir! \nSGT. NANTZ Marines. We stand here. Let these bastards know who they're fucking with. \nPVT. IMLAY \nSporadic FIRE now, as the marines fire on the advancing aliens, still at a distance. \nEXT. OFF-RAMP - 10 FREEWAY \nStavrou descends down the collapsed off-ramp, negotiating the fractured, angled slab of roadway. Kerns covers him above, from the freeway. Stavrou hits the ground, securing the area. He looks up at Kerns and gives him the \"All Clear\" sign. Kerns takes off... \nINT. / EXT. BUS - 10 FREEWAY \nAdukwu stands in.the bus, looking out to see Kerns running back to them, signalling. Adukwu turns to the civilians crowded behind him. \nADUKWU Okay, it's clear. We're gonna go. Amy and Kirsten, terrified, look up at Michele. She hurries the girls to the door of the bus as Kern runs up. \nMICHELE It's okay. I'll be right behind you. Adukwu picks up Amy. Kerns picks up Kirsten. \nPVT. KERNS (takes a breath, telling them, himself) It's gonna be scary but we can do it, okay? An alien round flies through the bus, shattering the back window! The girls scream. Kerns and Adukwu race away, running with the girls... Rincon grabs Hector. He and Michele follow... \nRUNNING ACROSS THE FREEWAY... To the off-ramp. It seems like a long way off. They run past Correggio, rocking a SAW full auto. The FIRE is deafening. \nCPL. CORREGGIO Come on!! Come on!! Get some! Rincon and Michele, breathing ragged, feet pounding, look up... They're getting closer and closer to the off-ramp as... Alien rounds blow chunks of concrete off the roadway... UP AHEAD, Kerns and Adukwu rush the girls to the EDGE OF THE RAMP, hurrying to get them down as... Rincon and Michele REACH THE OFF-RAMP now. Kerns grabs Hector, HELPING HIM ANGLE DOWN THE OFF-RAMP, getting the boy safely handed down to awaiting Stavrou as... \nON THE FREEWAY \nBANG! MOTTOLA TAKES A ROUND TO THE SIDE. Rincon spins, sees the marine drop, SCREAMING. Rincon looks back at Adukwu, who is busy getting Michele down the off-ramp now. Then Rincon looks back to the freeway, sees Mottola writhing in agony. Rincon runs to Mottola, kneeling next to him. Mottola looks up at Rincon, fear in his eyes. \nCPL. HARRIS Soon as they come through, blow 'em back to hell! The first alien appears THROUGH THE BURNING CORRIDOR. Imlay blows it away! Harris blows away the next... It's working!;. \nEXT. FREEWAY BY BUS \nNantz and Kerns fall back BEHIND THE BUS, next to Martinez, Correggio and a 2nd squad marine. Along with Harris and Imlay on the bus roof, they are the only ones left holding the aliens off. All FIRE forward as... More and more aliens begin pouring through, braving the flames... Into the line of fire... Many aliens go down. But because of their sheer numbers, few start to make it through, FIRING BACK at the marines. Martinez sees the 2nd SQUAD MARINE go down in front of him. Martinez rushes to his side... HE'S DEAD. Martinez rises to shoot and...THWUMMP. Martinez is hit. He looks down, blood running over his belt. Shock on his face. He's been shot in the stomach. Martinez looks around... The remaining aliens now only cars apart from them. Two forces taking cover behind spraying glass and punctured metal, firing directly into the faces of their enemy. Martinez pulls himself together, struggling over to Nantz. \nLT. MARTINEZ Pull the men back... Pull 'em all back now, Sergeant. I'm gonna stay and cover. \nNantz looks at Martinez about to say something. Sees the blood draining from his stomach, down his legs. Nantz grabs Martinez, pulling him up. \nSGT. NANTZ Lieutenant. We gotta get you outta here. No way we're leavin' you... \nLT. MARTINEZ I said I got it... \nSGT. NANTZ I'm not leaving you here to die. \nLT. MARTINEZ That's not your call, Sergeant. Now get your men outta here... He pushes Nantz away, looks around, the chaos slowing down for him. He reaches into his vest... Martinez hands the LETTER we saw earlier to Nantz. A moment between them. Nantz nods, then spins, moving, yelling to the men. \nSGT. NANTZ We're pulling back. Head to the lower street, now! NOW! Nantz runs toward the edge of the destroyed off-ramp, laying cover as the men head down. Harris and Imlay slide down off the roof of the bus, joining the others running to the off-ramp. Correggio sees... MARTINEZ STAYING BEHIND, shooting at the aliens, drawing their fire. \nCPL. CORREGGIO \n(TO NANTZ) What about the lieutenant? \nSGT. NANTZ Keep movin', corporal! Go! All the men climb DOWN THE OFF-RAMP. Nantz turns to go back to get the Lieutenant himself, sees... Martinez hauling himself toward the rear of the bus. \nEXT. BUS \nMartinez, behind the back of the bus, struggles to breath, still drawing fire. Grabs his radio. \nLT. MARTINEZ \n(TRANSMITTING) This is Lieutenant Bennie Martinez', U.S. Marine Corps! Aliens converge toward the back of the bus. Ten... Fifteen... Twenty ALIENS heading for the signal... Heading for Martinez. \nLT. MARTINEZ \n(TRANSMITTING) 1st Platoon, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines! He turns, sees Nantz coming back for him... Martinez pulls a smoke canister from his vest... Holds it up for Nantz to see... Then unscrews the fuse, pops open the gas cap of the bus... \nALIENS CLOSE IN ON MARTINEZ... Nantz turns, dives for cover as... Martinez drops the fuse into the gas tank... A flash of fear across his face as... Aliens are on him as... \nKABOOOOOOOOOOOOM! THE BUS EXPLODES IN FLAMES! Massive fire ball shooting 300 feet into the sky'! Nantz raises his head, debris raining down, sees... \nALL THE ALIENS DEAD. His eyes wide at Martinez's sacrifice, the burden now on him, he's in charge of the men, the civilians... Nantz gets to his feet. Runs for the off-ramp. \nEXT. OFF-RAMP. LOWER STREET - CONTINUOUS \nNantz drops down the destroyed off-ramp... Runs to the marines and civilians BEHIND THE ABANDONED VAN. He sees Adukwu working on Rincon, Hector crying in Michele's arms. \nSGT. NANTZ Package Mr. Rincon for transport. We've got to move... \nCPL. CORREGGIO Sergeant. Did you just leave Lt. Martinez back there? \nCPL. HARRIS Sergeant! Hard wire connection! \nNantz turns to see Harris behind a COUNTER, at a COMPUTER-- an INTERNET CONNECTION on its screen. The marines crowd around, reading the ominous HEADLINE... \"GLOBAL INVASION -- Alien 'Creatures' Attack From Oceans\" PICTURES of ALIENS racing through urban streets, swarming over cars stuck in massive lines,of traffic... Underneath these pictures we see CAPTIONS, a litany-of doom: Battle: Tokyo... Battle: Cape Town... Battle: Los Angeles... Then a BUDDY LIST pops up on the screen, an INSTANT MESSAGE: 'baby, is that you?' \nCPL. HARRIS Damn, that's Cherise... Harris quickly types back a response: 'you ok?' The message comes back: no, real scared.' Harris responds: 'where are you?' He hits SEND. But the message doesn't go through. He clicks the mouse. But the computer has frozen. Then 'Internet Connection Lost' pops up on screen. Everyone stares. Harris stands, walks from the computer. Stavrou watches him go as... \nACROSS THE BIG 5 FLOOR HECTOR steps back to his dad's side. Rincon's eyes open slowly. He looks at Hector. Manages a small smile. Reaches out, wipes a tear from his son's face. \nRINCON I'm very proud of you, son. You're being so brave... Hector throws his arms around his father, hugging him tightly. \nRINCON I love you, Hector. Mr. Rincon smiles. His face peaceful. Hector is silent, tears rolling down his face. \nPVT. IMLAY Thirty seconds! \nCPL. STAVROU Get away from the windows! Get those kids behind cover! The marines back away from the windows into the center of the store, hunkering down with the civilians. Everyone stares at the CLOCK on the wall as it ticks... \nPVT. KERNS C'mon. Fry those bastards... \nPVT. IMLAY Those bombs drop, then everything's gonna change. Get to the FOB, get some goddamn ammo... \nPVT. KERNS Some goddamn food... \nCPL. CORREGGIO Some goddamn tanks. Beat. Everyone stares as... The CLOCK ticks to NINE... \nAND NOTHING HAPPENS. They wait. Fear grows on everyone's faces. \nPVT. KERNS They shoulda' dropped, right? We'd feel it from here, wouldn't we? \nCPL. CORREGGIO That much ordinance? They'd feel it in Nevada. Something's wrong... \nPVT. IMLAY Maybe it's good... Maybe we turned the tide... \nCPL. STAVROU Yeah, right, Imlay... 'Cause we were kickin' ass out there. \nMICHELE What's happening, Sergeant? What's that mean? \nSGT. NANTZ I don't know. \nAdukwu quietly approaches Nantz now, voice low. \nPVT. ADUKWU Sergeant... Mr. Rincon is dead. Nantz turns, staring off at Hector, sitting by his father. It's all too much... \nSGT. NANTZ Jesus... Nantz takes a deep breath, his mind racing, the world closing in on him. He turns to Michele. \nSGT. NANTZ Listen, our Forward Operating Base is about a mile away. We have to go on foot. I'll need your help with Hector now. Michele nods. Watches as Nantz slowly walks to Hector. Nantz kneels by the boy. \nSGT. NANTZ I'm sorry Hector. Your dad... didn't make it. You understand? Hector, sobbing, overwhelmed by grief and fear, looks up at Nantz. \nHECTOR I don't wanna be here. I want my dad back. I want it all to go back to the way it was before... \nAT. THE FRONT OF THE STORE. Stavrou, eyes on the still street, sees... TWO ALIEN SCOUTS appear. They crouch by a car. \n(BEAT) Let's move. The group jogs silently DOWN THE ALLEY. \nEXT. STREET - LATER \nNantz leads the group down the residential street, tidy bungalows on either side. \nCPL. STAVROU You okay, bro? \nCPL. HARRIS I hadn't a pushed Cherise to get married, she'd still be in Chicago. Suddenly, Nantz stops, fist raised. The squad halts as... A SOUND fades in, a deep RUMBLING. The marines FALL BEHIND CARS now, pulling the civilians down with them as the RUMBLING continues to BUILD. \nSGT. NANTZ Under the cars! Now! The marines frantically shed their packs, squirming UNDER THE CARS with the civilians, pulling the kids under as... \nA GIANT HOST OF ALIENS \nRounds the corner in the distance, THOUSANDS'OF THEM, filling the street from sidewalk to sidewalk. An army on the move. NANTZ DRAGS HECTOR UNDER ONE CAR with him,' pulls the boy in close, gets his legs under the car, under cover, just as... The mass of aliens SWARM PAST, the ground shaking, RUMBLING. The humans HUDDLE UNDER THE CARS, peering out to see the legs and arms of the aliens flying by. Some bound OVER THE CARS, which bounce up and down, BANGING with the aliens' weight. The RUMBLING EBBS as the aliens disappear into the distance. \nEXT. STREET - LATER \nThe squad moves in formation, surrounding the civilians. Little Kirsten comes up behind Correggio. He's surprised as she slips her hand into his. Correggio looks down, seeing how scared she is. He smiles, grips her hand tightly. Up ahead, Nantz leads, MAP in hand. \nPVT. IMLAY How far, sergeant? \nSGT. NANTZ One block over. Imlay smiles at Kerns. \nPVT. IMLAY We'.re gonna make it! Dude, we're gonna make it... But as they approach a CORNER... Nantz stops, exchanges a glance with his corporals. \nMICHELE What's the matter? \nSGT. NANTZ The smell. An ominous beat. The squad moves down the dark street as... ASH FLOATS DOWN here from the sky... Like a beautiful early winter snow... \nTHEN THEY TURN THE CORNER \nWe slowly MOVE IN TIGHTER and TIGHTER on Nantz. Until we are CLOSE ON NANTZ' FACE. A REDDISH GLOW is reflected there. Nantz stops, looking horrified. We REVERSE to see... A DEEP BLACK COLUMN OF SMOKE rising into the night sky from NUMEROUS FIRES that rage within the fence line of... \nSANTA MONICA AIRPORT. As they approach the Forward Operating Base, the devastation is slowly revealed: CRASHED F-18 JETS and COBRA HELICOPTERS line the runways. BODIES and SMOLDERING MARINE VEHICLES litter the airfield. \nPVT. IMLAY Jesus... They wiped our Forward Operating Base right off the map. \nPVT. KERNS Now we know why those bombs never dropped. They took our jets out. \nCPL. CORREGGIO This was a dug-in marine Corps position that had armor, air and ground. Maybe we got nothing left to fight with... Michele MEETS EYES WITH NANTZ. His look tells us everything-- \nTHEY'RE LOSING THIS WAR. Nantz turns, spies an AIRPORT FIRE STATION by the runways. \nSGT. NANTZ Let's get under cover. Now. \nINT. DESERTED FIRE STATION - MOMENTS LATER \nThe marines enter cautiously, rifles up. Then they hustle the civilians inside when it appears safe. \nSGT. NANTZ Lock this place down. The marines fan out, securing doors, checking windows as... Nantz kneels by Hector, tries to comfort him. \nSGT. NANTZ A minivan's a target, Correggio. A LAV with a Bushmaster chaingun... That's an asset. Imlay grins. Nantz motions to him, starting off. \nSGT. NANTZ Come on. \nPVT. IMLAY \n(FOLLOWING) Me? Where, sergeant? Nantz points to the CONTROL TOWER, its windows blown out. \nSGT. NANTZ High ground. We need to see the big picture. \nINT. FIRE STATION - SAME \nKerns has a tub of ice cream, scooping bowls for the kids. \nPVT. KERNS My dad's a fireman. They love their ice cream. Used to visit the firehouse with my little brother, they always had tons of it... (re. the kids) My brother's not much older than these guys. \nMICHELE You don't look much older, either. She gazes at the kids, pain and anger washing over her. \nMICHELE Is this day ever going to end? \nPVT. KERNS Maybe the Sergeant'll find a way outta here. \nMICHELE \n(SMILES) What's with you guys anyway? Doesn't anybody have a first name? \nADUKWU Emmanuel. Manny. \nPVT. KERNS Pete. You married? Family? \nMICHELE I'm single. Lots of family back in Nebraska, though... Hopefully they're safe... She shakes the thought away. \nMICHELE What about you guys? \nPVT. KERNS Little Rock. \nADUKWU Nigeria. I came here to be a doctor. \nMICHELE You should be a surgeon, the way you cut into that thing... Adukwu smiles. Then his smile fades as he looks around. \nADUKWU Yeah. Maybe... \nINT. CONTROL TOWER - MOMENTS LATER \nNantz enters with Imlay. They look around... The WINDOWS have been BLOWN OPEN. The wind rustles papers through the ghostly space, blowing them out into the night. \nOn one desk, a COMPUTER is flashing a SLIDESHOW: Happy PICTURES of someone's family vacation. From this, high vantage point, they can see for miles... Nantz looks out one end of the control tower, sees all the way to the ocean... Then he turns, looks the other way, dead east... A vista of EXPLOSIONS, spreading-into the distance. ALIEN DRONE AIRCRAFT engage F-18s. One jet is blown up, spiralling to the ground. \nSGT. NANTZ Look how far east they've gotten. That's almost the whole city... Nantz looks out through BINOCULARS: Sees the HOLLYWOOD SIGN ablaze in the hills... Then pans to a mid-city area. Stops when he sees one quadrant of the city, blocks wide, SHIMMERING an INKY BLACK. Some kind of DARK ENERGY WAVE emanating from the ground. \nSGT. NANTZ What the hell's that? Imlay peers out. \nSGT. NANTZ That's right. This fight's not over. \nCPL. CORREGGIO Sergeant's gonna get us killed! Just like my brother. A beat. Nantz eyes Correggio. It's laid open now. \nSGT. NANTZ Believe me, Correggio, I grieved for every marine I ever lost... Nantz looks around now, from marine to marine. \nSGT. NANTZ But we are in the fight of our lives right now. And our duty is to keep moving forward. Keep fighting. That's how we honor men like your brother, Correggio. And Lt. Martinez. And Hector's father, who saved Adukwu's life. He wasn't trained for that. He just picked up a rifle and did what needed to be done. If a civilian can do that... \n(MORE) \nSGT. NANTZ (cont'd) Well then I better square my shit away and do whatever I have to do to defeat this enemy. But I can't do it alone. Nantz stares. The tension is palpable. \nSGT. NANTZ I need you men. And maybe we'll die fighting today. Not because we're heroes. But because we're goddamn United States marines, and always will be. \n(BEAT) I'm willing to give my full measure for you. I'm hoping you'll do the same for me. A BEAT, glances exchanged. THEN ALL THE MARINES RISE AS ONE. \nCPL. STAVROU Sergeant. We'll follow you to hell and back. Nantz smiles, nods. \nSGT. NANTZ Good. 'Cause that's where we're going. \nEXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nThe squad is moving in unison, covering all around, approaching the LAV. They jump in. \nINT. LAV - CONTINUOUS \nStavrou fires it up, drives off as... Nantz eyes the jumble of gear. He grabs his COMBAT SHOTGUN, a portable RADIO, which he makes sure is OFF... Then an olive case marked: GLTD. He stuffs it in his pack. \nPVT. IMLAY Laser target, sir? \nSGT. NANTZ Might have to get some cruise missiles in here. \nPVT. IMLAY Shit, yes, Sergeant. \nCPL. STAVROU \n(CALLING OUT) Hostiles. Twelve o'clock. Nantz looks up to see... ALIEN SOLDIERS appearing on the street now. Nantz goes back to stuffing his pack. \nSGT. NANTZ Just hit the gas, Corporal. We got plenty of armor. Everyone looks up at this. Then looks out to see... The aliens attacking, FIRING on the LAV as... Stavrou floors it, ALIEN FIRE pinging off the LAV's armor as... SPLAT!!! \nSTAVROU MOWS THROUGH THE ENEMY LINE. Nantz looks out the back to see some ALIENS STAGGERING AWAY. \nSGT. NANTZ Reverse, Corporal. \nCPL. STAVROU Aye, aye, Sergeant. As he BACKS UP, mowing back over the remaining aliens... The marines cheer. \nEXT. STREET - LATER \nThe LAV cruises slowly. Nantz stares forward. The BLACK DEAD ZONE looms ahead... As they get closer, it seems like the whole area is absent of light. A black hole. Nantz stares out, about to answer when the LAV LURCHES, then lurches again. Stavrou REVS the engine. \nSGT. NANTZ What's going on? \nNantz and Imlay, race along in the dark. They hear POUNDING FOOTSTEPS of the alien pursuing him. A glimmer of LIGHT ahead. Along the floor. It is, a DOOR. They burst through a DOOR, into... \nA DIM STAIRWELL. \nNantz follows Imlay UP THE STAIRS as... The STAIRWELL DOOR below is SMASHED OPEN. Nantz spins, swinging his shotgun. HE FIRES. BOOM! The blast ILLUMINATES the huge ALIEN, filling the stairwell with its horrible bulk. Nantz backs up the stairs, pumping the shotgun, firing... Each blast ILLUMINATES THE ALIEN in a STROBE EFFECT. The alien moves up the stares. Nantz KEEPS FIRING. The NOISE IS DEAFENING in the enclosed space. Then the SHOTGUN RUNS DRY. And we're left IN DARKNESS. Imlay clicks on his FLASHLIGHT, revealing... The ALIEN at Nantz' feet, its strange \"hand\" on his boot. Nantz, terrified, aims at the alien, waiting to see if it will move. It doesn't. \nINT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - MOMENTS LATER \nNantz and Imlay re-enter, running up to join the others. Up the stairs, by street-level, Harris and Adukwu keep watch. Harris motions: \"ENEMY TROOPS\". Nantz nods. Signals for all the marines to head down the stairs. The marines gather around Nantz. To Harris: \nSGT. NANTZ How many? \nCPL. HARRIS Hard to tell. A lot. \nSGT. NANTZ I think I got their attention. Nantz kneels. He opens his pack, pulls out the radio and the case marked GLTD. \nSGT. NANTZ Look. There's something big down in the tunnels. It's sucking up a lot of power, could be a major Command &.Control asset. \nNantz stares at his men. \nSGT. NANTZ We need to destroy it. \nPVT. KERNS But we got no jets left, right, Sergeant? \nSGT. NANTZ Hopefully, they can still fire cruise missiles from Pendleton or Vandenburg... I'll radio in a strike, paint the target from the street. You know what that means. The man nod solemnly. \nPVT. IMLAY We gotta hold 'em off long enough to paint the target. \nCPL. STAVROU If we can get a transmission out before the radio dies... \nCPL. HARRIS And the targeting laser lasts long enough for command to get a lock on the target. \nCPL. CORREGGIO Hell, dying's easy, ladies. Everything else takes balls, right? They all laugh softly. \nSGT. NANTZ Let's do it. He takes a deep breath, raises the radio, and TRANSMITS: \nSGT. NANTZ \n(TRANSMITTING) Any station, this is Foxtrot 2 November. Priority Fire Mission. I have identified a major enemy command and control asset-- located grid 459083. 1 WILL BE LASING. \nCOMMAND (V.0.) Foxtrot 2. You have visual confirmation of this C&C asset? We can't waste resources. \nSGT. NANTZ Affirmative. They're building a huge complex underground... I think it's the head of the snake. Repeat. I will be... \nTHE RADIO GOES DEAD. Alien fire EXPLODES now, rocking the station. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Nantz and the marines cover their heads as the station starts to come apart, chunks of concrete fall. The walls crack. Dust fills the air. Nantz SCREAMS as a chunk of concrete FALLS ACROSS HIS ANKLE. Then, it's over. All is silent. Nantz, GRIMACING in PAIN, strains to lift the concrete chunk off his ankle. He GROANS. The marines rise. Pale, sweating, Nantz hobbles to his feet. He slings his rifle, and carrying the GLTD, hurries on his bad ankle to the stairs. Nantz looks up. Rubble nearly fills the stairway. There is only a small opening of daylight near the ceiling. The men all unclip their web gear, begin climbing. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nA chunk of rubble falls from the pile at the subway entrance, and Nantz emerges, rolling down the pile to the street. The other marines follow, set up a perimeter as..,. Nantz takes cover behind a berm of rubble, DROPPING down, flattening himself to the ground. He sets the GLTD (LASER DESIGNATOR) up on top of the pile. Nantz removes his flack jacket and places it over the laser designator. \nSGT. NANTZ \n", "test1_input": "MICHELE I was more sure two minutes ago. She looks to Adukwu. They step to the body together as... Nantz approaches Martinez. \nSGT. NANTZ What's the plan, Lieutenant? \nLT. MARTINEZ Mission is still to get the civilians to the Forward Operating Base. We've got a battalion there, all that firepower... I was thinking, I saw a bus couple of blocks back on 11th... \nSGT. NANTZ Maybe we should stay on foot. Martinez looks at Nantz. Then opens a MAP, pointing to 'Santa Monica Airport' on it. \nLT. MARTINEZ The FOB is here, at the airport... That's miles to cover with those kids... And those bombs are gonna drop in a little more than an hour. (thinking, deciding) We've got to move fast. \nSGT. NANTZ We have no radio contact, nothing to let us know the best route to take... And a bus is a big target. \nLT. MARTINEZ I made the call, Sergeant. It's my responsibility. \nBeat. Then Nantz nods, turns. \nSGT. NANTZ Harris, Stavrou, lieutenant needs recon on a.bus. It was abandoned two blocks south off 11th... \nLT. MARTINEZ If it runs, get it back here. \nSGT. NANTZ Can you hotwire a bus? \nCPL. HARRIS (gestures to Stavrou) He's from Jersey, sergeant. A nod from Nantz on this. \nEXT. COMMUNITY CENTER ROOFTOP - MINUTES LATER \nCorreggio and Kerns are surveying the street. Correggio pulls the RADIO up, talks quietly into it: \nCPL. CORREGGIO Stavrou, Harris... \nINT. EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER - SAME \nStavrou and Harris peer out an EXTERIOR DOOR as they hear Correggio (V.0.) from the RADIO: \nCPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.) .you're clear down 11th Street. They exchange a quick glance. \nCPL. STAVROU Every day a holiday, buddy... \nCPL. HARRIS .every meal a feast. They slip outside, running off silently. \nEXT. COMMUNITY CENTER ROOFTOP - SAME \nCorreggio and Kerns watch Harris and Stavrou run down the street, covering them with their M-16s. \nINT. SIDE ROOM - LATER \nAdukwu and Michele, scalpels in hand, hover over the alien body. Its thick leathery skin has been sliced open. Martinez and Nantz observe, Imlay on post nearby. \nLT. MARTINEZ How's it going? \nADUKWU Well, Lieutenant, I'm a medic, Dr. McDermott's a vet... We weren't sure who was most qualified to cut this thing open. Martinez smiles. \n", "test1_true": "ADUKWU Part of its arm has been amputated to fit this weapon. \nSGT. NANTZ Talk about commitment to cause. Adukwu examines a VENTED CAP just to the right of where the alien's 'heart' would be. Thick, fleshy veins run from it. \nLT. MARTINEZ What is that thing? \nPVT. IMLAY He's from Nigeria, Lieutenant. Not a different solar system. Nantz looks over at Imlay. \nSGT. NANTZ Thank you, private. Adukwu twists the cap. It comes free, revealing... A GELATINOUS ORGAN. Slimy, viscous fluid seeping from it.. Everyone steps back, reacting to the putrid smell. \nPVT. IMLAY Whoa, that stinks! Everyone steps back except Michele, that is. Unfazed, she takes her scalpel, makes an INCISION across the organ. \nPVT. IMLAY I'm gonna puke. Swear to God, I'm gonna puke! \nSGT. NANTZ Whatever you do, do it quietly, Imlay. \nEXT. STREET - SAME \nStavrou forces the door of a METRO BUS open, climbs INTO THE BUS, ducking below the steering wheel as... Harris covers, staring off to the FAR STREET. Tree branches there cast LONG SHADOWS which sway with the breeze. Then... The indistinct FORM of an ALIEN scout appears in the shadows. \nCPL. HARRIS Hey, Stavs... \nCPL. STAVROU Relax. First thing I wired was a school bus. Trying to impress this Betty. She had a huge rack... \nCPL. HARRIS Enemy scout. Move your ass. Stavrou doesn't look up. Just works diligently. \nCPL. STAVROU Don't rush genius. \nEXT. ROOF - SAME \nCorreggio and Kerns remain still, peering into the distance. \nPVT. KERNS Shit. You seeing what I'm seeing? Correggio pulls BINOCULARS... POV THROUGH BINOCULARS: A SIDE STREET, TREES overhanging it. \nMovement. ALIEN SHAPES massing on the side street. Appearing and disappearing through the smoke and trees. Then the POV THROUGH BINOCULARS PANS to pick-up... The BUS. Nearby. In the path of the alien movement. Correggio grabs the RADIO. Says: \nCPL. CORREGGIO \n(INTO RADIO) Harris. Movement, 1500 meters up 11th. Suddenly, a loud BANG rings out below them. \nPVT. KERNS What the hell was that?! They exchange glances with the other marines across the roof. All four move quickly, converging on one side of the building, look down the side of it... An EXTERIOR DOOR leading into the center is BROKEN OPEN. \nINT. COMMUNITY CENTER SIDE ROOM - SAME \nMichele finishes her incision, carefully PEELS A SECTION OF \nTHE ORGAN BACK. Something vaguely METALLIC is revealed within it. As Michele touches her scalpel to it, it SPARKS. Then starts rhythmically GLOWING. \nLT. MARTINEZ Looks like it's receiving a signal... Suddenly, the ORGAN CONVULSES rapidly. Expanding, contracting. Nantz sees the ALIEN'S GUN VIBRATING now, the whole arm TWITCHING, spreading through the alien's body like a seizure. \n", "test1_id": 1680, "test2_input": "LT. MARTINEZ This thing's still alive! Nantz pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE, thrusting it DEEP INTO THE ORGAN, twisting viciously. \nThe organ stops vibrating. The glow fades. The body slumps. \nSGT. NANTZ Not so hard to kill when you know where to aim. Mottola appears in the room, a sense of controlled panic. \nPVT. MOTTOLA Lieutenant. There's a breach. \nINT. HALLWAY / COMMUNITY CENTER - SECONDS LATER \nThe marines step from the side room with Michele. They peer up and down the dark hallway, listening... OTHER DOORS along the hall take on an ominous presence now. \nSGT. NANTZ \n(LOW) They in the building? \nPVT. MOTTOLA No clue, Sergeant. An exterior door was broken open. \nSGT. NANTZ Lieutenant. Maybe we should gather the civilians in the gym. \nLT. MARTINEZ Good idea, Sergeant. \nINT. / EXT. BUS - SAME \nStavrou, still beneath the wheel. Harris, eyes on the street as the RADIO crackles with Correggio's VOICE: \nCPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.) Harris, hostiles advancing right at you. Approximately two hundred meters and closing... \nCPL. STAVROU Done! Stavrou hops into the driver's seat, tries to start the bus. It doesn't turn over. Harris and Stavrou exchange a quick glance. Stavrou drops below the wheel again... \nINT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nMore ominous BANGS ring out from down the long hallway, BUILDING in intensity. Nantz stands, staring DOWN THE DARK HALL with his M-16, surprised as Martinez steps up next to him. \nLT. MARTINEZ We're in it together, Sergeant. Martinez slams a grenade into his launcher now. \nLT. MARTINEZ C'mon, Mottola. Get that bus here! Mottola is on the radio, frantic: \nPVT. MOTTOLA Where the hell is that bus?! \nINT. BUS - SAME \nStavrou is still underneath the wheel. Harris looks out to see ALIENS rounding the corner in the distance. \nCPL. HARRIS Get this thing started. \nCPL. STAVROU Hey, why didn't I think a' that? \nINT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - SAME \nCRACK! Down the hall, the sound of a door splintering... \n", "test2_true": "LT. MARTINEZ Go! Get 'em out! Imlay swings the GYM DOOR OPEN, moving the civilians out. \nIN THE LOBBY Nantz and Martinez stand together, aiming at the hall as... A final BANG... We hear a door being BURST OPEN. \nNantz, in the front, exchanges a glance with Martinez at the ominous sight of... A PLUME OF BLACK SMOKE rising in the distance. \nTHEY SPIN ONTO LINCOLN BOULEVARD. Screech to a halt at the obstacle course of BATTLE WRECKAGE strewn across the street. Noxious BLACK SMOKE is rising from BURNING HUMVEES and TRUCKS. Smoking CRATERS pothole the street. \nLT. MARTINEZ \n(SHOCKED) Jesus Christ. Those alien ships took the whole line out. \nSGT. NANTZ We've got forty minutes 'til they level this area. \nLT. MARTINEZ \n(TO STAVROU) Get us to the Forward Operating Base. Fast. Stavrou lays on the gas, speeding away as, in the back, the other marines stare out. Mottola peers into the sky...' \nPVT. MOTTOLA Where the hell are all our jets? \nEXT. BUS (MOVING) - SIDE STREETS, SANTA MONICA \nThe bus snakes through jammed streets, abandoned cars, bombed out buildings. \nINT. BUS -SAME \nMartinez is in the front with Stavrou, Nantz in the middle of the bus, hovering near the civilians sitting on the floor. Rincon holds Hector, Michele with her arms around both girls. Marines on the seats above, weapons ready. Nantz hears Imlay whispering to Harris: \nPVT. IMLAY Why the hell'd the lieutenant wanna take a bus? We're sittin' ducks. \nSGT. NANTZ (low, hard) The call's been made, private. You so eager to decide the fate of all these people? Imlay is stone silent. \nSGT. NANTZ Didn't think so. Then Nantz looks up, meeting eyes with Martinez as... A NOISE in the distance now. A low VIBRATION, building. Nantz moves to Martinez. They peer out of the front. LIGHTS fill the sky, heading east. As they approach... The VIBRATION gets louder and louder, shaking the bus now. \nSGT. NANTZ Everybody get down, weapons inside the bus. Make no noise. The men pull their guns in from the windows, crouching as low as possible, straining to see, hear... The vibrations grow louder, LOUDER! Suddenly... WHOOSH! An ALIEN AIRCRAFT rips overhead. Then another, and another, and another... All heading east. The image of their speed, their power, their other- worldliness is overwhelming, devastating. Nantz stares, relief flooding his face, as the armada flies on. Leaving them behind. Until... Suddenly, Mottola's RADIO BLARES! \nCOMMAND \n(FROM RADIO) All stations this net, urgent traffic. Multiple enemy aircraft moving east... As the transmission rings out, Nantz looks up to see... One ALIEN SHIP split from the armada, TURN BACK TO THE BUS. \nLT. MARTINEZ It's coming back...! The children scream, marines agitated... all hear a low vibration, echoing off buildings, heading their way. \nSGT. NANTZ (staring at the radio, \nREALIZING) Kill that radio! Mottola turns off the radio. The alien aircraft STOPS. Hovers a moment. \nSGT. NANTZ They're tracking our signals! All radios, cell phones-- keep everything off! Everyone stares silently, tensely. Then... A single BEAM OF LIGHT suddenly shines from the alien craft. Then the alien aircraft MOVES FORWARD again. Slowly. But still heading their way. \nLT. MARTINEZ It's still coming... It's searching... Nantz grabs a PORTABLE RADIO. He looks around the bus, sees the little girl, Kirsten, ponytail in her hair. He leans down to her. \n", "test2_id": 1681, "test3_input": "INT. LAV - SAME \nStavrou drives, hands gripping the wheel as he maneuvers carefully through wrecked abandoned cars. \nIN THE TURRET Nantz eyes a nervous Imlay. \nSGT. NANTZ Extract site's only a couple more miles, Imlay. Imlay nods back. Nantz peers down to... \nSTAVROU, BEHIND THE WHEEL... Eyes focusing tensely through the thermal sight scope. \nTHERMAL SIGHT POV Green wash of the city passing by. Tall, empty buildings all around... Suddenly, a big DARK OBJECT in the street! Stavrou SLAMS THE BRAKES. Civilians and marines in the tight passenger compartment are thrown around. Right in front of the LAV... A massive CRATER. The street's impassable. \nSGT. NANTZ We gotta go around. The LAV backs up, Nantz scanning the sky, gripping the M-240 machine gun, trying to see out into the darkness... Then they TURN A CORNER... And a VIEW BETWEEN TWO TALL BUILDINGS is harrowing... FOUR ALIEN DRONE AIRCRAFT hovering... Then turning. Flying toward them. \nSGT. NANTZ Get ready, Imlay. Here they come. Stavrou looks out to see... A HELICOPTER in the distance. \nCPL. STAVROU Think I see our ride, sergeant! \nSGT NANTZ Get us there. Cause we're about to get lit up. The alien drone ships are winging at them. They are only 200 meters out when... \nSGT. NANTZ See what that Bushmaster can do, Imlay! Imlay OPENS UP on the 25MM BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN. \nPVT. IMLAY Come on, you martian bastards! The Bushmaster is a rapid-firing CANNON spewing 200 rounds a minute, each capable of destroying a light tank. For once, the aliens are overmatched. The ALIEN SHIPS take HEAVY FIRE from the Bushmaster... One goes down IN FLAMES, the others PEEL OFF, flying behind buildings. \nPVT. IMLAY Where'd they go? Where'd they go? Nantz is scanning the sky, then... \nSGT. NANTZ Imlay, on your six! Imlay spins in the turret, picking up... The three remaining ALIEN AIRCRAFT coming back around. The lead alien ship FIRES! A ,CAR EXPLODES next to the LAV. Imlay rocks in the turret. \nPVT. IMLAY Son of a... Imlay targets, fires the Bushmaster... The lead alien ship is HIT, winging out of control INTO A SECOND SHIP. The TWO SHIPS EXPLODE into a building as... The FINAL ALIEN AIRCRAFT dodges the FIREBALL, flying straight at the LAV... \nSGT. NANTZ Getting close, Imlay... \nPVT. IMLAY I got it. Imlay FIRES a burst. The last aircraft is hit... \nIt PINWHEELS TO THE GROUND, exploding into FLAMING WRECKAGE which hurtles RIGHT AT THE LAV. \nSGT. NANTZ Stand on it, Stavrou! Stavrou pushes it, TRYING TO OUTRUN the burning wreckage... Which is almost on top of the LAV as... Stavrou spins AROUND A CORNER, escaping. The wreckage explodes into a building behind them as... THUMP - THUMP - THUMP! The sound of a UH-1'Medevac ECHOES. \nPVT. IMLAY The chopper! Nantz looks out, sees the CHOPPER LANDING in the street. The LAV screeches up amid the RUBBLE and SMOKE. \nCPL. STAVROU Last stop! \nSGT. NANTZ Everybody out! The marines rush the civilians OUT OF THE LAV... Nantz and Imlay scrambling out last. \nSGT. NANTZ Pretty decent shooting, Imlay. \nPVT. IMLAY \n(GRINNING) Goddamn, you did it, sergeant! We're gonna get these people out! \nEVERYONE RUNS TO THE CHOPPER. The marines begin loading the civilians in, the old-school CREW CHIEF hopping off to help the kids in. \n", "test3_true": "SGT. NANTZ What are you talking about?! \nCREW CHIEF We've lost most of our air assets. We're abandoning Los Angeles. This city's done...! (to the pilot) Let's go! The chopper powers up, Nantz SCRAMBLES ON with the others. \nINT. EVAC HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS \nThe CHOPPER BEGINS TO LIFT OFF. As it rises, Nantz gazes out at the CITYSCAPE. He sees fires, wreckage everywhere. Then he looks off to see... \nTHE BLACK DEAD ZONE SHIMMERING NEARBY Nantz watches the HELICOPTER BANK TOWARD THE BLACK ZONE. But as it gets closer... The HELICOPTER DIPS precipitously, suddenly losing altitude. The kids SCREAM. The marines hang on. Nantz sees the PILOT STRUGGLING with the controls. The HELICOPTER'S GAUGES are going crazy. The pilot BANKS HARD AWAY from the area, reversing course. And the helicopter STABILIZES. \nSGT. NANTZ What the hell happened?! \nCREW CHIEF Something there was playing hell with our power! Nantz stares at this. Then notices Hector watching. him. He sees the 2/5 MEDALLION clutched tightly in Hector's hand. Sees the words \"Retreat Hell.\" Nantz looks back at the MYSTERIOUS BLACK PATCH of cityscape. Then he turns to the crew chief. \nSGT. NANTZ Set us back down! \nCREW CHIEF What?! The other marines in Nantz' unit look over, alarmed now. \nSGT. NANTZ We need to recon that area! \nCREW CHIEF We can't land! May not have power to take off again... Nantz looks out. Spies a BUILDING with a FLAT OPEN ROOF. He points to it. \nSGT. NANTZ Then we'll rope down! \nCPL. CORREGGIO What the hell, sergeant? What's going on? \nSGT. NANTZ There's something over there... We could be the only ones left here to figure out what it is. (to the others) Let's go, marines. The marines look frightened, confused. They start to pull themselves up. ROPES are dropped from the chopper as it hovers over the building... \nSGT. NANTZ NOW! Go! Go! The marines start to RAPPEL DOWN, one after another as... Nantz exchanges a glance with Michele. \nSGT. NANTZ They'll get you safe. He smiles at the girls. Then turns, nods at Hector. Puts a hand on his shoulder. A BEAT. \nSGT. NANTZ See you soon, buddy. \nHECTOR What are you gonna do? \nSGT. NANTZ We're gonna fight. Nantz turns, grabs a ROPE, drops out of the chopper. \nEXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS \nAs the chopper hovers, Nantz drops to the roof, hunkers down with the other marines. Nantz watches the evac helicopter fly off to safety. Then he turns to the marines, who stare back hopelessly, clearly at their lowest point. \nPVT. KERNS Why'd we get off the chopper, Sergeant? \nSGT. NANTZ 'Cause we have a job to do. \nPVT. IMLAY But we were getting out...! \nCPL. CORREGGIO You have some hunch and now we're stuck out here in the shit?! \n", "test3_id": 1682}

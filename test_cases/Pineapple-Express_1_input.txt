DALE And am I the only guy you gave it to? 
SAUL Yeah. So, we're the only guys. 
DALE But, like, another dealer, couldn't identify it, the pineapple weed? Like, if they found a roach of it, right? 
Saul thinks for a moment. 
SAUL I could. Why? 
DALE (panicking) We should go, we shouldn't be here! We should go! 
SAUL No...seriously, why? 
DALE I left a roach of this weed in front of Ted's house! 
SAUL So what? I leave roaches all over fucking town. 
DALE No, listen - they could find the roach and say, "This is pineapple weed, Saul's the only guy in town who has pineapple weed, therefore he must have witnessed the murder or know who did - let's go kill him." 
Finally, Saul understands. 
SAUL Mother of fuck! 
He SPRINGS to his feet and BOLTS for the door. 
SAUL (CONT'D) Let's go! 
Dale grabs Saul and stops him. 
DALE Wait! 
SAUL Why!?! Let go of me! Let's get the fuck out of here! 
DALE Saul, wait! Grab anything we might need, like your weed and money and stuff. 
Saul grabs his bag of weed and shoves it in his backpack. They run for the door. 
DALE (CONT'D) Are you sure you're not forgetting anything? 
SAUL Yes! Come on! 
INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Saul and Dale run to the elevator and frantically press the button, terrified for their lives. 
SAUL Fuck! I forgot something! 
Saul runs back to his apartment, leaving Dale alone and frightened. Saul BURSTS back out of his apartment holding his cell. 
SAUL (CONT'D) Dude, I was so scared going back, I thought there was gonna be guys there, and then you'd be gone, and there was this music in my head- 
DALE We'll take the stairs, it'll be faster. 
They scramble towards the distant stairwell. Almost at the door, they hear the DING of the elevator arriving. 
DALE (CONT'D) Go back! Go back! 
They DASH back to the elevator. Dale shoves his arm between the doors and they hop in. Saul rapidly presses the LOBBY button as the doors shut. They're both on the verge of hyperventilating. 
DALE (CONT'D) Okay, man. We gotta try to relax. 
SAUL Why?!? 
DALE We don't want to draw attention. 
SAUL (freaking out) Whose attention!?! You think they could be down there? In the Lobby? Right now!?! 
DALE I don't know! Who knows? Just try to be cool. 
DING  The elevator SUDDENLY STOPS on the second floor. 
DALE (CONT'D)                     SAUL Oh my god!!!                  Ahhh!!! 
The doors OPEN! There's no one there. The doors close. 
SAUL What the fuck was that? 
DALE That was bad - Calm! Calm! Calm! 
The elevator stops at the lobby and the doors open, they step out, bumping into two rough looking guys.

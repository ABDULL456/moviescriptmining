WINK No. Hushpuppy... I can't take care of you no more. 
HUSHPUPPY Yes you can. 
Hushpuppy stares him down, accusing. 
WINK Daddy's dying! 
Hushpuppy's chest heaves up and down. 
WINK (CONT'D) My blood is eating itself. You know what that means? 
HUSHPUPPY Don't be sayin' about dying. 
WINK Everybody's Daddy dies. 
HUSHPUPPY Not my Daddy. 
WINK Yes, your Daddy! 
Her defiance is broken and the information starts to sink in. It hurts Wink as much as it hurts her. 
WINK (CONT'D) I didn't want you to watch that, ok? You understand? 
Wink doubles over hacking. He COUGHS horribly. 
Hushpuppy looks down and sees blood spotting the grass, dripping from his mouth. 
The Bathtub gangs charges out the door! 
Across the parking lot they go in a spree of euphoria, coming to a halt around Wink. 
Hushpuppy is trying to drag his limp body across the parking lot. 
HUSHPUPPY Come on! Come on! 
Little Jo hold Hushpuppy away from him. 
WINK Walrus, get me home. 
EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY 
The Bathtub crew carries Wink through the entrance to town. His arms slug over Walrus and Jean Battiste, he's barely able to help walk. 
We sense from the weary faces and silent eyes that it's been a long journey home. 
INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY 
They drag Wink through the Shacko entrance. 
Everyone goes in except Hushpuppy who stops outside the door as they lay him down in convulsions. She stays and tries to watch. 
Wink tries to say something to Walrus and can't. Blood bubbles out of his mouth. Wink catches Hushpuppy's eye then looks away as fast as he can. 
Reeling, but steady, Hushpuppy backs out the door. 
EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY

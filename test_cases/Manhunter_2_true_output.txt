LECKTOR (smiles) It doesn't matter to me, Will. 
GRAHAM I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor. 
LECKTOR Yes, I thought so. 
GRAHAM It's about Atlanta and Birmingham. 
LECKTOR Yes . 
GRAHAM You read about it, I'm sure. 
LECKTOR In the papers. I don't rear out the articles. (laughs) I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you? 
GRAHAM I thought you would have some ideas. 
LECKTOR Why should I tell you? 
GRAHAM There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...? 
LECKTOR Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle. (laugh;) He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground. I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face. (beat) Never mind, it's boring. 
GRAHAM You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason. 
LECKTOR Pray tell. 
GRAHAM I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for. 
LECKTOR Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me. 
GRAHAM No. I knew that I'm nor smarter than you are. 
LECKTOR Then how did you catch me, Will? 
GRAHAM You had disadvantages. 
LECKTOR What disadvantage?. 
GRAHAM You're insane. 
LECKTOR You're very tan, Will. 
Graham does not answer, If anything happens, there is a tightening of the musculature repressing his reactions to Lecktor. 
LECKTOR Your hands are rough. They don't look like a cop s hands anymore. That shaving lotion is something a child would select. It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it? 
Another silence. Lecktor's eyes look as if they're drilling into Graham's head, trying to find out things. Trying to find a way to hurt Graham. He's very threatening. Then relaxes: 
LECKTOR Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity. 
GRAHAM I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best... 
LECKTOR (interrupts) Do you have the file with you 
GRAHAM Yes. 
LECKTOR Pictures? 
GRAHAM Yes. 
LECKTOR let me have them,, and I might consider it. 
GRAHAM No. 
LECKTOR Do you dream much, Will? 
GRAHAM Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor. 
LECKTOR You haven't threatened to take away my books yet. 
Graham gets up and starts to walk away. 
LECKTOR let me have the file. Then I'll tell you what I think. 
Graham stops at the door before he knocks for the attendant. Then he folds the abridged file tightly into the sliding tray. Lecktor pulls it through. 
GRAHAM sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees: 
GRAHAM'S POV: EXTREME CLOSE PAN THROUGH CELL OP DR. LECKTOR 
Toothbrush, mirror, sink, Sryrofoam cups, soft paper jour- nals, T-shirts, neatly stacked hospital pads, sneakers with- no shoelaces, the wall, seatless toilet bowl, etc, etc All the objects are brilliantly lit with sharp bluish light. Their edges are sharper and more defined than normal. The shadows of the bars make hard-edged stripes. It is a high resolution, highly brilliant sec of images. It feels like a hyper-perception of reality, a super-realism perceived by the mind of Graham. It is interrupted when: 
LECKTOR (O.S.) There is a very shy boy, Will. 
GRAHAM 
snaps back to the present, looks at Lecktor. 
LECKTOR What were the yards like? 
GRAHAM Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why? 
LECKTOR Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.

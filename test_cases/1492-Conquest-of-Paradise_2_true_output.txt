COLUMBUS There aren't any monsters, Fernando. The only monsters are in here... (he taps his own forehead) Watch! 
He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible monsters, transforming it at once.  FERNANDO laughs immediately. 
FERNANDO I want to go with you! 
COLUMBUS There'll be a time. 
FERNANDO You promise? (Columbus nods his head) Do you swear on St. Christopher...? 
FERNANDO pulls the chain with the St. Christopher medal from under COLUMBUS' shirt. 
FERNANDO Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven? 
COLUMBUS (laughing) Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them! 
And he hugs his SON tightly. 
EXT.  HILLSIDE AND GATE - PRE-DAWN 
A luminous procession passes through a Moorish stone gate, down to the harbor.  We see the faces of the SAILORS and their FAMILIES -- COLUMBUS, PINZON AMONGST THEM -- We sense the fervor and apprehension of the departure.  The procession is lead by MARCHENA and four young NOVICES carrying the Madonna.  All hold long, burning tapers, saying the rosary.  A SAILOR pushes through the crowd, and kisses the Madonna's feet. 
EXT.  PALOS HARBOR - DAWN 
Hundreds of candles flicker in the pre-dawn light, held by the FAMILIES and FRIENDS of the SAILORS. 
The SANTA MARIA the PINTA and the NINA nestle against the quayside.  Dwarfed by the hulls, a flotilla of smaller fishing craft, returning from night fishing, accidentally witness this event. 
EXT.  MAKESHIFT CONFESSIONAL - DOCKSIDE - DAWN 
MARCHENA sits on a barrel and crosses himself.  Behind a curtain sits COLUMBUS. 
MARCHENA In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti. 
COLUMBUS Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned. 
MARCHENA recognizes COLUMBUS' voice. 
MARCHENA I am listening, my son. 
COLUMBUS Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you. 
MARCHENA What are you saying? 
COLUMBUS I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said. 
MARCHENA How long? 
COLUMBUS I am not sure... It could be twice the distance. 
A pause. 
MARCHENA May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men! 
COLUMBUS If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me... 
MARCHENA My son, my son... (he shakes his head) Your certitudes are sometimes frightening... (pause) Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will. 
COLUMBUS You are bound by an oath, Father. 
A long silence. 
MARCHENA I believed in you... 
COLUMBUS Give me absolution. 
No response. 
COLUMBUS Give me absolution, Father! 
Devastated, MARCHENA reluctantly makes the sign of the cross. 
EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - PALOS - DAWN 
COLUMBUS walks over to where BEATRIX and FERNANDO are waiting.  He kisses and hugs FERNANDO. 
MARCHENA (O.S.) Ispo Te Absoluto.  May God forgive you and have mercy on your soul, Christopher Columbus.  Go in peace.

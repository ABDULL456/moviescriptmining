NAN The definite recommends are way off for a score this high and, even for action-adventure, it's just too low for women. (Burke looks anguished) I'm sorry. 
He leans against the car for support. 
BURKE It was such a good score. 
NAN (extraordinarily sympathetic) I know... And, unfortunately, yesterday's tracking wasn't... (he reacts) I'm sorry... They just don't seem in the mood for action-adventure right... (he reacts) Sorry... May I tell you one more thing? (he looks up in anticipatory fear) I think it's so wonderful that you don't worry about even trying to act strong. 
BURKE Thanks. You want to eat something sometime? 
NAN I'm, uh... I'm blushing from head to foot. 
BURKE Good. I'll call you. 
As Burke moves to his car. He SEES the Group Captain paying Matt. 
GROUP CAPTAIN Thirty-two, thirty-three. 
Burke is looking at Matt with some surprise. 
BURKE You want to do this regularly for me? I was gonna offer, but I thought it would humiliate you. 
MATT (straight at him) I don't mind an occasional odd job. But I can't work tomorrow. I have to get my kid. 
As they get in the car, Burke has the front door open, about to get in--reconsiders, and gets in the rear door. 
BURKE Okay, I got the cards to look at--I think I'll ride back here. (to Nan) Maybe I'll drop by your place tomorrow. 
Matt gets behind the wheel, thereby ending the day as a full- fledged chauffeur. They drive off. 
EXT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Burke and Nan returning from lunch. 
NAN So, thanks for lunch. I hope this leads to an evening date. Though I have to stay home with my daughter, Leslie, on Saturdays. 
BURKE (sincerely) Yeah, okay. You were very interesting to talk to. I swear to God. Honest. No kidding. You really were. 
NAN I believe you. (sincerely) And I was very surprised what you were like when you weren't working. There was absolutely no difference. You want to see where we do the tracking? 
BURKE (excited) Is it okay? 
INT. TRACKING ROOM - DAY 
The enter the room containing a maze of telephone cubbies with workers manning the phones. 
NAN Nobody ever wants to see how we do the polling, but they're like little starved puppies when the data comes in--running at you, scrambling to... 
Burke hardly hears. He is awed as if by a cathedral. 
VARIOUS WORKERS 1) How often do you go to the movies? 2) I'm going to describe a movie in one sentence and then ask you to rate it on a scale of... 
BURKE (as the workers continue) I love this. This is what counts and this is where you count it. 
NAN (soft and true) That's the same way I feel. 
BURKE You phone all over--you know what movies they're waiting to see, whether your TV spots are working. You know what the country thinks. 
WORKER ...what feelings do you have about Cher as a singer, an actress, or potential date... 
BURKE (again) ...and it's accurate. 
NAN Within six-point-eight percent. 
BURKE And you can't fix it... right? 
NAN No... no... Sometimes just for myself, I can't resist asking America a personal question. 
BURKE Like? 
NAN (simply) When do you feel more worthless-- mornings or afternoons? 
BURKE I gotta get back. 
They pause by a workers to say goodbye. 
WORKER Assume Michelle Pfeiffer is the woman-- which of these 67 actors would you most like to see her with... Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Dustin Hoffman, Johnny Dep, the guy from 'Major Dad'... 
NAN There's something I meant to tell you. You may have noticed something unusual about me. 
BURKE I gotta get back. 
NAN I could never find the right time to...

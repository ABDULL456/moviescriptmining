IKE Bastards think they can cheat me? 
JOYCE Nobody cheated you, Ike.  Go home. 
Ike reaches across the bar and slaps him.  Joyce scowls, more irritated than hurt and too tired to make anything of it.  The few other patrons left look up drowsily.  Ike nods in drunken satisfaction, picking up his rifle: 
IKE And I don't take no mouth from Any bartenders neither.  There, See?  Give somebody a rap on the beezer, get some God damn respect Around here.  Now you tell the Earps and Doc Holliday if I see 'em on the street, I'm gonna send 'em all to hell on a shutter.  You tell 'em that. 
Ike and the McLaurys storm off as Virgil and Morgan step out onto the street.  Wyatt turns to them in disbelief: 
WYATT What the hell's going on? 
EXT - ALLEN ST/TELEGRAPH OFFICE - DAY 
Walking down Allen, Ike stops the group at the telegraph office: 
IKE I want to send a telegram. 
EXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY 
We start to feel a growing sense of dread as 3 grim HORSEMEN come galloping out of the desert toward us.  Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne ride into town, trotting by the jail with the Earps looking on. 
VIRGIL Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream. 
WYATT Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though... (pauses, sighs) Guess you better swear me in. 
INT - WYATT'S HOUSE - DAY 
In tight on a brass-mounted wooden case.  It opens to reveal a gleaming Colt .45 with an extra long barrel, the gold shield inlaid on the burr walnut grips engraved with, "To Wyatt Earp, Peacemaker..."  This is the Buntline Special, Wyatt Earp's legendary sidearm.  Wyatt takes it from the case and puts it in his coat pocket as Mattie looks on. 
MATTIE Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again. 
WYATT Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things. 
EXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY 
Behan and Jospehine watch from the hotel as the 6 Cowboys, all but Ike armed with pistols, walk side-by-side down the middle of Allen. 
BEHAN I'm terribly afraid this looks Like the end of the Earp brothers. 
Josephine goes pale... 
EXT - ALLEN ST/JAIL - DAY 
The Cowboys swagger by defiantly, giving the Earps sidelong glances.  Meanwhile, the street starts to BUZZ, townspeople beginning to notice that something is happening. 
VIRGIL Here they are again.  Look at 'em. 
WYATT Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on. 
Suddenly Doc appears from around a corner, a little the worse for wear in a long, dark Inverness cloak and carrying a big gold-headed walking stick. 
MORGAN What're you doin' out of bed, Doc? 
DOC What the hell's going on?  I've Had five people walk up to me Saying the Clantons and McLaurys Are gunning for me. 
EXT - LOT BEHIND O.K. CORRAL - DAY 
A vacant lot behind the OK Corral with Fly's Gallery on the left and the Harwood house on the right.  The Cowboys stand in a knot near their horses, passing a bottle around. 
FRANK Like to teach those bastards a lesson. 
BILLY Probably already scared them to death. 
TOM You call it, Ike.  What're we gonna do? 
IKE (grabs bottle) Gimme that. 
EXT - ALLEN ST/JAIL - DAY 
Virgil comes out of the nearby Wells Fargo office with a huge Stevens 10 gauge shotgun just as Joyce runs up. 
JOYCE Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral. 
WYATT Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this. 
Doc turns on Wyatt, genuinely shocked and hurt. 
DOC That's a hell of a thing for you To say to me. 
VIRGIL What the hell're we gonna do? 
WYATT Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.

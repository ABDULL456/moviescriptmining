LARGE Oh, washers. I never use those. I never knew what they were for, so. I just always threw them away. I never used washers. Silence. 
KARL Oh, well listen, I want to talk to you both about a good opportunity. (like he's memorized it 
LAST NIGHT) For you and your loved ones. We all have dreams. I know I do. I know of an exciting opportunity that people are talking about. Mark returns holding a box with a picture of steak knives on the side. 
MARK Hey. We gotta get going. 
LARGE Yeah, well it was great to see you, man. I'm sure I'll see you around. 
KARL Yeah, well let me get your number. 
LARGE oh, well we gotta run. I'm listed. Just call information. It's been so long since I've been home I don't even remember it. 
SAM Nice meeting you. 
INT. HANDI-WORLD CHECKOUT -- CONTINUOUS 
MARK Why is it always the losers who get into the pyramid schemes? Why isn't it ever some charming hot girl nagging you incessantly to buy shit? 
LARGE Oh, is that what it is? 
MARK Detergent or some shit. The thing I don't understand is, if it worked, why would he be working here. The guy's a freak; he pops Darvocet like it's Ritalin. 
LARGE Why are you buying knives? I don't need knives. They arrive at the counter. A young Black woman with enormous gold earrings and long fingernails stands at the register. 
MARK I'd like to return these. 
WOMAN You got a receipt. 
MARK Actually, no. It was a gift. She clicks her tongue. She begins filling out a form. 
WOMAN Why are you returning these? 
MARK They're not sharp enough. 
WOMAN They're not sharp enough? 
MARK No. Not for what we need them for. They couldn't cut cans. 
WOMAN You bought them to cut cans? 
MARK No, but in the commercial they say that if I wanted to cut cans I could. But with these knives I can't. 
WOMAN Well it comes with a sharpener. Did you try it? 
MARK Yeah, they're just... I don't want them; not sharp enough. She rings it into the register and counts out bills to Mark. 
WOMAN Thirty-nine, fifty-three. I hope we came in handy at Handi-World. Please come again. They exit the store and enter the mall. 
EXT. MALL - DAY 
They walk past stacks of lumber. 
MARK A major loop-hole in the Handi- World return policy permits returns without receipts on items below forty dollars. 
LARGE So how often do you go? 
MARK I hit every employee once, then wait for them to. hire. new ones. Luckily, no one works at Handi- World for very long. Except Karl Benson. 
LARGE You know, Mark, it's my last day in town. I have money. I can give you some. 
MARK I don't need your money, I'm making my own right now. 
LARGE Or fuck, take Jesse's - the guys a millionaire. 
Mark stops and looks at Large in the eyes. 
MARK i don't take anybody's money, Andrew. I make my own. Favors are bad news. And the only thing worse than a favor, is a favor involving money. 
EXT. RESCUE SQUAD -- LATER 
The motorcycle pulls up behind two ambulances being cleaned with hoses. Large sees Cynthia changing the sheets on a stretcher. They climb off. 
MARK This will only take a second. 
(TO CYNTHIA) Is Aaron here?

Nick pours him more coffee; Gus guzzles it. 
GUS (loud) How could you fuck her? 
It gets some looks from the other people in her -- Nick shushes him, pours him more coffee.  He drinks it. 
GUS (quietly) You wanna die, son?  What is it -- those goddamn tourists -- you still feel so bad about that you're wigglin' your way into an icepi -- (suddenly louder) We got too many goddamn tourists comin' here anyway -- plenty more goddamn tourists where they goddamn came from. 
Some people here really give him the looks now.  Gus looks angrily away from them, drinks more coffee. 
NICK (after a beat; quietly) I'm not afraid of her. 
GUS (loud) Why the hell not? 
NICK I don't know.  I'm just not. 
GUS (loud) That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head. 
GUS (smiles; to Nick) It ain't your brain. 
They look at each other a long beat.  Gus drinks more coffee. He sits back, pulls his cowboy hat over his eyes. 
A long beat. 
GUS (quietly) I.A. done did a track on Lt. Martin D for Dickhead Nilsen.  They found a safety deposit box with fifty- thousand dollars in it, taken out three months ago, used that one time. 
He looks at the fat woman again -- leers at her obscenely. 
She looks away. 
NICK (after a long beat) It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago. 
GUS Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle. 
Nick looks at him and smiles a thin smile; he's not there, he's completely preoccupied. 
INT. A CAR - NIGHT 
Someone is watching as he and Gus come out of the diner. 
EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT 
He stands by Gus as Gus gets into his battered, rusted, vintage Cadillac. 
NICK You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you? 
GUS In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch. 
NICK Come on, I'll drive you in this thing. 
GUS You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car. 
And he steps on the gas and ROARS out of there, forcing Nick to get out of the way.  Nick looks after him a long beat, shakes his head. 
INT. A CAR - NIGHT 
Someone is following him slowly as he walks down the street. He turns a corner, walks down the alley towards his Porsche, parked behind the country and western bar. 
The car suddenly speeds up -- ROARS down on him from the back, full bore. 
EXT. THE ALLEY 
He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood... barely avoiding the car.  He sees the car at the end of the alley, turning out It is a black Ferrari. 
INT. HIS PORSCHE 
He GUNS it down the alley, makes a wild turn in the direction the Ferrari turned. 
EXT. THE STREET 
The Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping them, looking almost out of control, its MOTOR screaming. 
INT. THE PORSCHE 
He sees the Ferrari turn ahead.  When he gets to where it turned, he turns wildly. 
EXT. THE STREET 
The Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche is gaining ground behind it, making turns. 
INT. THE PORSCHE 
The Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a road going up a hillside.  He yanks the wheel hard.

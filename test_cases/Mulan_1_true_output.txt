Mulan [seeing them from behind, gasps]:  Huh.  [Mulan runs, grabs her sword, mounts Khan, and heads out following the Huns to the Imperial City] 
Mushu:  Home is that way! [points to the opposite direction Mulan is heading] 
Mulan:  I have to do something. 
Mushu:  Did you see those Huns!?  They popped out of the snow, like daisies! 
Mulan:  Are we in this together or not? 
Cri-Kee [emphatically]:  Chirp, Chirp. 
Mushu:  Well, let's go kick some Huny buns!  [Jumps onto Khan and utters fighting words as they ride off to the Imperial City]  Wu Hu Ha Ga, Wu Hu Ha Ga 
[Cut to the victory parade in the Imperial City.  Fireworks go off, kites are flying.  The drummers march by, followed by the flutist, followed by the acrobats.  The Parade Leader follows, then Shang and his men, followed by lion dancers] 
Parade Leader:  Make way for the heros of China. 
[Shang leads the men on horseback, all have sorrowful looks on their faces.  Mulan rides up through the crowd and stops.  She looks around and sees Shang in the parade] 
Mulan [calling out]:  Shang! [riding next to him] 
Shang [surprised]:  Mulan? 
Mulan:  The Huns are alive, they're in the city. 
Shang:  You don't belong here Mulan, go home. 
Mulan [with a scowl rides khan to the other side of Shang]:  Shang, I saw them in the mountains.  You have to believe me. 
Shang:  Why should I? 
Mulan [riding ahead to block Shang's horse]:  Why else would I come back?  You said you'd trust Ping.  Why is Mulan any different?

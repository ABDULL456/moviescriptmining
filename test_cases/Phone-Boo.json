{"train": "Phone Booth \nPHONE BOOTH \nby \nLarry Cohen \nFADE IN: \nNEW YORK CITY - AERIAL VIEW OF DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY \nMULTIPLE STREET SCENES - DAY \nThe sidewalks crowded as usual.  A sea of humanity.  People come and go -- always in a hurry.  Oblivious of one another. \nA TRAFFIC JAM -- A STREET being torn up by construction workers; A SANITATION TRUCK loading up refuse; VENDORS PEDDLING nuts and salted pretzels; PANHANDLERS blocking a passerby.  Intimidating.  Demanding.  Almost mocking. \nWe're surrounded by the teeming life of the city as we've come to expect it -- complete with a cacophony of sound. \nMULTIPLE CUTS -- Phone kiosks and phone booths on the East Side and West Side -- uptown and down. \nOne frustrated caller has lost his money in the slot and he takes it out on the equipment -- smashing the receiver violently against the coin box until the instrument splinters into a dozen pieces. \nNARRATOR There are 237,911 pay telephones in the five burroughs of the city of New York.  Many of them are still in working order. \nDOZENS OF QUICK CUTS -- \nNEW YORKERS on the phone in extreme close up.  We don't hear the words.  Only the facial expressions inform us that these are human beings under tremendous pressure.  Life in the city is wearing them down. \nMULTIPLE SHOTS - JUST MOUTHS \nLips jabbering into receivers.  Cross-cut against one another. \nNARRATOR Despite increased usage of cellular devices, an estimated four and a half million New Yorkers and two million visitors still utilize pay telephones on a regular basis.  At thirty-five cents a pop... for the first three minutes. \nANGLE ON CORNER IN MID-MANHATTAN - DAY \nThere's a phone booth situated on the southeast side of the street. \nNARRATOR You're looking at the telephone booth at the corner of 45th Street and 8th Avenue in the heart of the Manhattan theatrical district.  It has been scheduled to be removed and replaced by a kiosk.  It's one of the few remaining phone booths left in the city. \nCAMERA MOVES IN on the irate caller in the booth -- a very well-dressed gray-haired lady -- totally conservative in appearance. \nWOMAN IN BOOTH (into receiver) You have lied to me for the last time, you lowlife prick bastard!  I don't ever want to hear the sound of your fucking voice again. (listens) Yes, well fuck you, too! \nShe slams down the receiver and exits.  The booth remains vacant for a brief interval. \nNARRATOR At least three hundred calls daily originate from this booth.  The coins are collected twice a day. This booth has been burglarized forty-one times in the last six months. \nSomeone is approaching the booth, fishing in his pocket for coins.  This is STUART SHEPARD, snappily dressed, his hair styled and his nails manicured.  Here is a man who clearly takes excellent care of himself.  He sports a Donna Karen suit and silk Armani tie. \nHe's about to step into the booth when he's accosted by a middle-aged man in a soiled apron who's run out of a nearby restaurant and has finally caught up with him. \nMARIO Stu, we got to talk. \nSTU Wish I could accommodate you, Mario, but this is my busy time of day. \nMARIO How come you cross the street every time you go past the restaurant? \nSTU Why don't I stop in later for some lunch? \nINSIDE THE BOOTH, Stu inserts his thirty-five cents and dials. \nSTU Hello, Mavis, sweet creature. \nMAVIS' VOICE Where have you been?  Do you think I have nothing to do but wait around for you to call? \nSTU I'm only a few minutes late, loveliest individual on earth. \nMAVIS' VOICE Stu, I'm so lonely.  When can I see you? \nSTU Good news in that arena.  Kelly goes into rehearsal as of Monday. You know how dedicated she is.  By the time she gets back from dancing her ass off, she goes right to sleep.  We'll have both our days and certain nights.  Not to mention when they take the show on the road. \nMAVIS' VOICE How long is that for? \nSTU Four to five weeks -- minimum. \nMAVIS' VOICE Maybe I should quit my job so we can be together full time. \nSTU I wouldn't do that. \nMAVIS' VOICE Sometimes I think if I have to give one more fucking manicure... \nSTU That's how you met me. \nMAVIS' VOICE I never saw a worse set of nails. Bit right down to the quick. \nSTU I'm much better groomed since you've been looking after me. \nMAVIS' VOICE I'm glad you admit it. \nSTU Even Kelly remarked on it when I first met her. \nMAVIS' VOICE She could care less how you look. She's only interested in pushing her own career.  Some wife you're stuck with! \nSTU The marriage is not without its compensations.  Do you imagine I could afford that apartment on what I'm earning?  Not with everybody cutting back on the publicity.  Not to mention a million college graduates coming into the profession trying to cut me out. And one thing you can't expect from your clients is loyalty.  They get a couple of bad notices, they dump you.  Goodbye. \nMAVIS' VOICE Don't go. \nSTU I wasn't saying goodbye to you.  I was saying how the clients try to give you the wave off without even a month's notice. \nA conservative businessman now stands outside the booth waiting to use it.  He deliberately glances at his watch a few times to demonstrate his impatience.  This bothers Stu who slides the booth open a crack. \nSTU (yelling) What?  Is your watch busted?  It's twenty after eleven and I'm gonna be occupied indefinitely with my transaction.  So get out of my face! \nHe closes the booth up again and turns his back to the gentleman who gives up and departs. \nSTU Sorry, honey.  There will be no further interruption. \nMAVIS' VOICE Why must you always be calling me from some booth? \nSTU On account of that phone records are regularly subpoenaed in divorce proceedings.  And I don't want some entry showing up on my cellular bill either.  She gets the mail. She looks these items over. Sometimes she even dials up a strange number to see who it is. \nMAVIS' VOICE Then she suspects something. \nSTU It's only because her last husband, the choreographer, ran around on her.  She can't get that out of her head.  That's how she caught onto him.  The phone bills. \nMAVIS' VOICE She hasn't developed much skill at holding a man. \nSTU You know what a self-fulfilling prophecy is?  She was so sure I was going to find me a woman that she finally drove me back to you.  I thought I'd feel all guilty about it -- but I guess it hasn't kicked in yet. (beat) Still, I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.  Basically, Kelly's a decent individual. \nMAVIS' VOICE What about hurting me?  Like last time? \nSTU Who is this? \nVOICE Someone who's watching you. \nSTU Get lost! \nVOICE Love the gray suit.  That red and black tie makes a nice combination. \nStu is taken back by the accurate description of his apparel. He looks around nervously. \nSTU Where?  Where are you? \nVOICE Closer than you think. \nSTU I don't see you. \nVOICE There are any number of windows. Check them out. \nIndeed that street corner is surrounded by high rise buildings and hotels. \nSTU Okay, you had your little joke. \nVOICE I'm not sufficiently amused.  Not yet.  We have more to talk about. \nStu knows he should simply hang up but something tells him not to.  Perhaps it's the strange tone of the man's voice. \nSTU Do me a favor.  Call up somebody else. \nVOICE But it's you I'm interested in. You know how many people use that booth every day? \nSTU Why don't you tell me? \nVOICE Better than two-hundred people on average. \nSTU Is that what you do?  Count them? \nVOICE What else do I have to do?  It's interesting watching people. Trying to guess who they are.  And what they're up to. \nSTU What are you -- a shut-in of some kind? \nVOICE You might say that.  I can't go out.  I might be seen. \nSTU Somebody's looking for you? \nVOICE Desperately. \nSTU The cops? \nVOICE Not yet. \nSTU The ex-wife.  What'd you do -- run out on child support? \nVOICE What kind of man do you think I am? \nSTU Frankly, I could care less.  You had your fun.  Now goodbye. \nVOICE It's not in your best interests to hang up on me.  That would make me angry. \nSTU Isn't that just too bad? \nVOICE For you. \nVOICE You're only making it easier for me to do you harm. \nSTU Oh yeah.  Right.  Can you see how I'm trembling? \nVOICE You will be. \nSTU Shit, this is a new one.  Fucking threatening calls in a goddam phone booth.  When are you going to start with the heavy breathing. \nVOICE I'm not the degenerate.  You are, Stu. \nSTU You don't know anything about me. \nVOICE Infinitely more than you know about me. \nSTU Like what? \nVOICE Like the number you dialed when you first entered the booth. \nSTU How would you know that? \nVOICE I'm watching through a scope and I could clearly read the buttons you pushed.  I have another extension here by the window.  Shall I dial that same number back for you? Would that convince you? \nStu nervously cranes his neck, looking around at all the tall buildings that surround the street corner. \nSTU'S POV \nPANNING up at thousands of windows.  The Voice could be coming from anywhere. \nBACK TO STU IN THE BOOTH \nVOICE Let's see who's on the other end of the line. \nSTU Don't. \nVOICE Too late. (beat) It's already ringing.  I'll hold the receiver up so you can listen in. \nStu can hear the beeping as the other line rings. \nThen Mavis' voice can be heard answering.  Stu listens helplessly. \nMAVIS' VOICE Hello? \nVOICE Well, hello. \nMAVIS' VOICE Who is this? \nVOICE Someone who's really tight with your boyfriend -- who just called you from his favorite phone booth. \nMAVIS' VOICE You know Stu? \nVOICE Stu?  Oh, I know him better than anyone.  What he does -- how he thinks.  How he lies. \nMAVIS' VOICE Who the hell is this? \nVOICE Stu is listening in.  He knows what we're both saying. \nMAVIS' VOICE Stu?  Is that true?  Are you there? \nVOICE He doesn't feel like talking. \nSTU (shouts) Mavis!  Just hang up the goddam phone. \nVOICE Why don't you tell me what you think of us? \nMAVIS' VOICE You're both disgusting. \nVOICE That's what he said about you. Well, if Stu didn't have the balls to come out and tell you the truth, I felt it was my responsibility to clear the air.  Goodbye now, Mavis. Thanks for your time. (the phone clicks off; we hear only a dial tone) Back to you again, Stu. \nSTU You total asshole!  How could you do that? \nVOICE Speaking of females, that woman hovering outside the booth -- may as well tell her that you'll be on the line forever. \nSTU Like hell I will. \nVOICE I'm ready for you to take out your cellular and phone home.  And this time, I'll listen in. \nSTU There's no chance of that. \nVOICE Or should I call Kelly and make up something totally outrageous?  You must realize by now I have a vivid imagination. \nSTU You don't know our phone number! \nVOICE Are you absolutely sure?  I may have been watching you on a regular basis.  Keeping track of all the numbers I see you dial. \nSTU And I'm supposed to believe that? \nVOICE I've put a great deal of preparation into this -- prior to actually saying hello.  Now do you want to dial 832-7165 -- or should I? \nThe sound of the actual number being spoken shocks him even more than the earlier mention of his name. \nSTU What are you going to tell her? \nVOICE You'll do the talking. \nSTU What am I supposed to say? \nVOICE Try telling her the truth. \nSTU Look, I don't want to hurt Kelly. She's always there for me.  It's just my nature to have a little 'strange' on the side.  It doesn't mean shit. \nVOICE But you still find it necessary? \nSTU Kind of like having a beautiful home.  With everything you ever dreamed of.  But you still need that vacation now and then.  Some nice hotel room with a great view. Maybe a pool.  Only you wouldn't want to spend more than a few days in any hotel.  Eventually, you want to go back to your home and all your stuff.  You're real glad to check out. \nVOICE Kelly is home and Mavis is a hotel? I'm sure they'll both appreciate that explanation. \nSTU You're ruining my fucking life, you sonofabitch. \nVOICE Didn't I warn you about calling me names?  It makes me vindictive. \nSTU What else can you do to me? \nVOICE We haven't even begun. \nSTU She's not home.  She went out. \nVOICE I'll bet she's back.  Now hold the cellular up where I can see it -- so I can be certain you don't misdial on me. (pause) A little higher and to your left. Now I have it in perfect view. Dial slowly. \nMore violent rapping on the glass from the persistent black lady outside. \nFELICIA If you got you a cell phone, how come you taking up the whole fucking booth!  This here's an emergency! \nSTU There's another booth on the next block. \nKELLY'S VOICE Are you sure you're alone?  I hear somebody in the background. \nSTU The guy in the next booth.  He's got a bad connection and he's hollering his fool head off. \nVOICE You've got an answer for everything. \nSTU I love you, baby. \nKELLY'S VOICE Do you? \nSTU You know that. \nKELLY'S VOICE Stu -- who was that man? \nSTU What man? \nKELLY'S VOICE Some person who phoned fifteen minutes ago -- just after you went out. \nSTU I don't understand... \nKELLY'S VOICE This total stranger rang up and told me to wait by the phone -- because you'd be calling me in a few minutes -- from a booth.  And I said what would he be doing in any phone booth? \nSTU And what did this guy say? \nKELLY'S VOICE He said you'd be making phone calls.  What else? \nSTU Making calls is part of my business. \nKELLY'S VOICE To whom? \nSTU Clients.  People.  Planting items like I do. \nKELLY'S VOICE Women? \nSTU Once in a while one of them could be a woman.  I just called \"Elaine's\" and talked to her to see who was in there last night. \nKELLY'S VOICE You know exactly what I mean. \nSTU You're not going to start that shit again? \nKELLY'S VOICE I just feel something is wrong. \nSTU What could be wrong? \nKELLY'S VOICE The way you sound.  You don't sound like yourself. \nSTU Yeah?  Who do I sound like? \nKELLY'S VOICE Someone who's scared.  There's fear in your voice like I've never heard before. \nVOICE See, Stu?  Kelly agrees with me. \nKELLY'S VOICE I want you to come back home.  Now! \nSTU I told you.  In a while. \nKELLY'S VOICE No.  I want you here now.  In case he calls back, I don't want to answer again. \nSTU Why should he call back? \nKELLY'S VOICE I feel like he's going to. \nVOICE Maybe you are one of them. \nSTU Hey, I have worked in a boiler room myself peddling \"Term Life.\"  I Would never be rude to a fellow salesperson. \nVOICE Can you feel it on you now?  The heat of it.  I'm moving the strike zone down to your stomach area. Now I'm raising it up again. Directly above the chest cavity -- sliding up to the forehead just above the left ear. \nSTU Shit -- I do feel it. \nVOICE Tell me where I'm going with it now. \nSTU Across my forehead -- now back where it was before. \nVOICE I'm amazed how you can do that. You're amazingly accurate. (beat) Now I know what you're thinking. If I drop down on the floor of the booth and flatten myself out... \nSTU No, I'm not thinking that. \nVOICE Oh yes you are.  Can I crawl out using the booth as a shield?  Can I crawl to that Chrysler illegally parked only three or four feet away?  The shattering glass may cut me, but it'll only be superficial. Otherwise, this lunatic will never let me out alive. \nSTU No.  You will.  I know you will. If I just cooperate. \nVOICE Where is it now?  Think and feel for the warm spot. \nSTU Below the shoulder? \nVOICE Which one? \nSTU The right shoulder. \nVOICE Remarkable how we're in tune. You're doing far better than the others. \nSTU What others?  What do you mean? (no reply) You said 'others!' \nVOICE (finally) I'm sure you read about the Italian tourist shot dead ten days ago at the corner of Forty-fifth and Eighth? \nSTU I saw it on the news. \nVOICE And where are we now? \nSTU Oh, God.  Forty-fifth and Eighth. \nVOICE What else do you remember about that killing? \nSTU I don't know. \nVOICE Try. \nSTU He was gunned down.  And nobody was caught.  And they didn't even bother to take his wallet or his watch... or anything. \nVOICE Now you know why.  It wasn't a robbery. \nSTU What did he do? \nVOICE He hung up -- so I disconnected him permanently. \nSTU Please -- don't do it to me.  You got no reason to do it to me. \nVOICE Don't give me reason. \nSTU I'm not looking to.  Tell me what you want! \nVOICE Tell me about your job. \nFELICIA The man don't sound like he means it. \nLEON I agree. (to Stu) Why don't you hang up a minute so we can discuss this matter at length. \nSTU It's long distance.  I can't lose the call -- I might not get them back. \nLEON Do I have to rip that fucking phone out of there? \nSTU That wouldn't be a good idea. (into pay phone) Would it? \nVOICE Not at all. \nSTU I gave you everything I've got. \nLEON That pinky ring looks attractive. Felicia might like that. \nFELICIA It might fit. \nSTU You want the ring, you've got the ring.  If I can get it off. \nLEON I can get it off you. \nLeon reaches in and grabs Stu's ring hand. \nSTU Let go of me!  It's coming loose. There. (he tosses it) Okay, Felicia, with my deepest apologies.  Goodbye now. \nLEON What's really going on in that booth -- that escapes the naked eye? \nSTU Nothing.  Talk.  That's all. \nLEON That your connection on the end of the line?  Or are you dealing? \nSTU This has nothing to do with drugs. \nLEON You gotta be high on something to willingly divest yourself of your valuables -- just to maintain occupancy of a fucking phone booth that the local bums piss in every night. \nSTU I knew it smelled for some reason. \nLEON You look like you're ready to piss yourself. \nSTU Because I am. \nLEON Maybe if the city provided decent public toilets, folks wouldn't relieve themselves in the subway stations and phone booths! \nSTU I'll take it up with the mayor. \nLEON Next thing you know you're gonna claim we mugged you -- took your billfold and watch. \nSTU No, you didn't.  It was a fair and equitable deal.  You had territorial rights to this booth and I paid a license fee.  Fair is fair.  Now leave me in peace. \nLEON You sure you're alright? (to Felicia) He don't look well. \nFELICIA Kind of pale.  Even for a white man. \nLEON Jaundice they calls it.  Probably advanced liver trouble. (to Stu) If it's cirrhosis, you better find yourself a twelve step program and quick. \nSTU Thanks for your interest but I'm in perfect health. \nFELICIA So how come his hand is shaking? \nLEON The man is cracking up. \nBut Leon continues rocking the booth.  It won't come loose -- so in frustration, he punches in a side pane of glass. \nThe glass shatters all around Stu, who does his best to shield himself from the slivers. \nSTU (into pay phone) The guy's insane! \nVOICE Only one way to stop a mad dog. Give me permission. \nSTU I can't. \nVOICE If he forces you out of that booth, I've told you what to expect.  You or him, Stu. \nLeon is smashing other panes of glass now -- one after another -- as Stu cowers inside. \nFELICIA Don't cut yourself, honey. \nA crowd of derelicts and street people are now gathering to watch the out of control pimp take out his wrath on the booth and its occupant. \nDERELICT Looks like the fucker is comin' loose. \nSTREET PERSON Shove it out into the oncoming traffic. \nDERELICT What'll you bet the bus could knock that fifty feet? \nThe booth is being decimated but Stu hangs onto the phone. \nSTU (into pay phone) Hello?  Hello? \nVOICE (with heavy static) You're breaking up.  We're about to be cut off. \nSTU I can't help it! \nVOICE That counts as a hang-up. \nSTU No.  It can't.  That's not fair. \nVOICE I can still make him stop.  Say the word.  Can you hear me? \nSTU Yes. \nStu sees the red dot reappear on Leon's chest as he continues to barrage the booth with punches and kicks. \nThen Leon recoils, staggers a step backward.  He doesn't realize he's been shot. \nThere's been no sound of gunfire.  Perhaps a silencer was used -- or the downtown traffic drowned out the solitary discharge. \nLeon looks confused at first.  His ladyfriend has no idea he's wounded -- neither do the derelicts and street people who've assembled on the corner. \nEven Stu isn't sure -- until the blood starts oozing from the wound on the pimp's chest -- staining his yellow vest. \nHe isn't assaulting the booth anymore.  He's trying to keep his balance.  He slumps forward, hanging onto the booth for support -- only a few inches from Stu's face.  The blood runs down the side of the booth. \nSTU (into pay phone) You did it! \nVOICE You said 'yes.' \nSTU I said 'Yes, I can hear you.'  Not 'Yes -- kill the motherfucker!' \nVOICE Don't try to renege on it.  I was following orders. \nSTU You're twisting it all around.  I didn't do this! \nVOICE That's up to you.  But any mention of me will not be appreciated. \nSTU You mean...? \nVOICE You won't even get to finish your sentence.  Oh look, that little red dot is dancing around all over you again.  You saw how quickly it can happen.  And how accurate I can be. \nSTU They can't blame me -- I'm not armed. \nVOICE Who's going to believe that?  With all those witnesses to the contrary. \nSTU They can see with their own eyes. \nNot far away, we hear the BLAST of POLICE SIRENS drawing closer. \nVOICE Remember to leave me out of it. \nSTU How can I? \nVOICE You'll put the proper spin on it. Isn't that your specialty?  Feeding the public a story that may not have a shred of truth -- and making it totally believable? \nSTU This isn't a story.  This is real. This is murder. \nVOICE If you'd only dealt with the man reasonably, shown him some respect, this might not have been necessary. \nSTU I gave him my money, my watch... \nVOICE But not your respect.  Which is what he required of you. \nSTU He was a fucking thief. \nVOICE And now he's a fucking dead thief. Do you feel better about that? \nSTU I don't feel a bit guilty.  This is all your doing! \nVOICE Now you're being disrespectful of me.  You never learn.  Your job is to deal with people -- but you're not good at it. \nSTU Hey, I'm not taking any more criticism from some lunatic sniper who gets his kicks killing strangers. \nVOICE You keep insisting I'm a stranger. Probably because you don't recognize the voice.  But there are cheap electronic devices available that disguise the voice.  I might not even be a man.  I might be one of those many women you've almost totally forgotten.  One who doesn't forgive easily.  One who wants to watch you squirm. \nSTU You're a man.  I know you're a man. Women don't kill with telescopic rifles.  They stab you. \nVOICE You sound so sure of that.  But you've never provoked any man as much as have the women in your life.  And so many of them, Stu. (a beat) Do you even remember their names? \nSTU I've got no time to rehash my whole life.  Oh my God!  The cops are here. \nPolice cars are pulling up on all sides of Eighth Avenue. \nTraffic has suddenly been shut down.  Prowl cars have now blocked the streets. \nPRODUCTION NOTE: Everything is seen from Stu's perspective without intercuts. \nHalf a dozen cops now emerge and approach with drawn guns. \nFELICIA (pointing) That's him -- in the booth.  He's got a gun! \nAs she hurls accusations, she's lugging Leon's lifeless body out into the gutter into the center of Eighth Avenue. \nIt's a bright afternoon.  In the distance, we hear the maddening HONKING of uptown traffic that is now being rerouted, creating a huge bottleneck and raising the anger of irate motorists and bus drivers whose horns provide their simplest form of protest.  It's a discordant concert that echoes the confusion and frustration which Stu now feels... \nAs the cops surround the booth -- at a distance. \nRAMEY I respect your right to privacy. I've been to therapy myself.  The department provides it.  I know it's not good form for a cop to be admitting that, but... \nVOICE Tell him not to come any closer. \nSTU Stop right there.  Back up a few steps.  Back where you were. \nRAMEY If it makes you more comfortable. \nVOICE Tell him to read you your rights. \nSTU I want you to read me my rights and stop asking questions. \nRAMEY Al least tell me your first name. \nSTU It's my right not to have any name. \nRAMEY No gun and no name.  You're a highly underprivileged person. \nVOICE Demand a lawyer. \nSTU And get me a lawyer, too.  I want a lawyer brought down here to negotiate my surrender. \nVOICE Brilliant, Stu.  Keep winging it. \nRAMEY It'll be hard to find a lawyer willing to risk his life.  But if you hand over the gun... \nSTU How can I when you won't let me take it out? \nRAMEY We'll take it out for you -- as soon as you exit the booth with your hands raised and... \nSTU (interrupts) Now we're back to that again.  It's always \"Get out of the booth.' 'You can't stay in the booth.' Well, I like it in the fucking booth.  It's my whole world now. It's my booth and I'm never coming out. \nRAMEY We're not about to force you because there could be a miscalculation and then we'd never find out why this happened. \nSTU Why is it so important to know? The guy is dead.  Isn't that enough?  Knowing isn't going to make him alive again.  So who gives a fuck! \nRAMEY It's what makes the job interesting.  Finding out why. Something drove you to do this. You didn't go out today expecting this to happen.  It was a nice day. You were out for a walk.  And then suddenly it all changed. \nSTU All I wanted was to make a phone call.  One lousy phone call for thirty-five fucking cents. \nVOICE Careful, Stu.  Don't volunteer too much. \nRAMEY You got some bad news on that call. \nSTU The worst. \nRAMEY Something that pushed you over the edge? \nSTU And I've been falling ever since. \nRAMEY Time to land. \nSTU When you hit bottom, you die. \nRAMEY I'm your safety net. \nSTU If I tell you what you want to know -- you'll die, too. \nSomething about the implied threat sends a chill through Captain Ramey. \nINSERT SHOT \nVOICE It might even be worth it.  She's insistent, isn't she? \nThe cellular won't stop ringing. \nSTU If she knows I'm in trouble, she won't give up. \nVOICE Probably glued to the TV by now. I'm watching coverage on two stations now.  Channel surfing. (pause) Well, there you are on two and four and five.  Not any decent angles on you, though, stuck inside there. \nThe cell phone continues beeping until the sound of it is maddening.  Stu is still afraid to reach for it and provide the cops with an excuse to open fire. \nVOICE But if you'd take one or two steps outside and look up, I think they could get a clear picture of you. \nSTU You said I'm not allowed to leave the booth. \nFinally the cell phone stops ringing. \nVOICE I might be willing to bend the rules and let you enjoy your moment of fame.  Set the phone down without hanging up... and take a step or two outside.  Just for a minute.  Then come straight back in or I'll be forced to provide 'live' coverage that should rival the historic Zapruder footage. (beat) Nothing like an exploding head to excite viewer interest. \nSTU No, thanks.  I'll stay where I am. \nVOICE It was only a suggestion.  Since you're convinced I'm going to plug you anyway, it can't matter much. \nSTU If you shoot me, you give yourself away. \nVOICE Even without a muffler, they'd never hear the report with all this noise.  Afterwards, it'd take them a good ten minutes to realize you weren't plugged by some overzealous officer.  Then they'll blame the media for inciting a crackpot vigilante to come down here and do the SWAT team's job for them. \nSTU You expected them to come.  You had this all worked out. \nVOICE I write the scenario and you all play your parts -- as directed. \nThe damned cell phone starts beeping again.  Stu fights the temptation to grab for it and hear Kelly's voice for one last time. \nSTU Poor Kelly.  What she must be going through. \nVOICE Why don't you tell her how you feel about her? \nSTU I'd never get the words out.  Not with fifteen or twenty rounds in me. \nVOICE You can't be certain they'd fire. They'd see it was only a phone. \nSTU They wouldn't wait to see. \nThe cellular ringing continues jangling Stu's nerves. \nSTU Why doesn't she hang up? \nThen Stu notices something in the crowd gathering far across the street behind the police barricades.  Countless faces rubbernecking, probably hoping to see some display of violence that would end with him face down dead on the pavement. \nAnd in the midst of them -- one face familiar to him.  A female, quite pretty... even in tears.  It's Kelly.  (We see her only in LONG SHOT -- a distant figure in bright green jacket that makes her stand out from the crowd.) \nSTU It's her!  She's not calling me. She's over there. \nVOICE Is she? \nSTU The blonde girl in the green jacket. \nVOICE Can't miss her.  Very attractive, isn't she? \nSTU She must've heard all the commotion and come downstairs. \nThe cellular is still ringing. \nStu resists pleading because he knows his silence is more powerful. \nThere's no glass in the left side of the booth since the late Leon smashed it all out. \nNothing to shatter when the sniper squeezes off his shot. \nVOICE May I call attention to the yellow pages? \nThe frayed yellow phonebook dangling from a chain under the telephone shudders under the impact of a direct hit. \nThere's been no sound of a gunshot, but the damage is there to behold. \nStu reaches for the phonebook. \nThere's a bullet hole straight through it.  Pieces of the .30 calibre slug have shattered into many tiny fragments and are imbedded between the pages, half-way through the thick volume. \nStu pries pieces out of the pages of the directory.  He looks at them in the palm of his hand. \nVOICE Hollow points are designed to break up on impact.  It would've behaved differently if it had pierced your soft flesh.  The pieces would've bounced around looking for a way out.  That's where the real damage occurs -- finding an exit -- deflecting off all that bone... \nStu wants to shout \"STOP,\" but restrains himself.  Not talking gives him some degree of power. \nVOICE Still the silent treatment?  My father used to dish that out when he chose to punish me.  Not a word spoken -- one time for over a month.  I'd try and goad him to acknowledge I existed, but he stared right through me.  You're bringing back unhappy childhood, Stu.  That's not wise. \nStu still declines to answer.  His silence seems his only weapon.  He tosses the bullet fragments out of the booth onto the pavement. \nVOICE Since you're ignoring me, I'll focus on someone else. (a beat) There she is -- nice and sharp.  I can see the two little punctures in each earlobe and my God, what kind of a girl would have her nostril pierced? \nStu realizes the sniper now has Kelly in his sights. \nSTU No! \nVOICE What was that?  Louder, Stu.  We must have a bad connection. \nSTU Leave her out of it. \nVOICE I didn't expect her to show up here.  But since she has -- I'll improvise. \nSTU Don't.  Please don't.  I'm sorry. I'm talking to you again.  I'll talk all you want! \nVOICE It's a bad dye job.  The black roots are growing in and it makes her look cheap. \nSTU I've screwed up her life enough already.  Please don't hurt her. \nVOICE I don't necessarily have to kill her.  I could be persuaded to settle for a reasonable mutilation. Which part of her displeases you most?  If she turns a bit more in profile, I'm accurate enough to remove the tip of her unpleasantly protruding nose.  It's just cartilage.  Any decent cosmetic surgeon will have her looking better than ever. \nSTU'S POV - FOCUS SHIFTS TO KELLY \nin the crowd.  Distant yet distinct amongst the curious onlookers. \nJUMP CUT \nCLOSER ON KELLY -- OBLIVIOUS TO HER DANGER. \nAS SEEN THROUGH CROSS HAIRS OF TELESCOPIC SIGHT \nfollowing her as she forces her way through the crowd toward the police officers. \nHer face virtually fills the screen. \nPRODUCTION NOTE: The only time we deviate from Stu and his POV is when we see the sniper's own POV through his telescopic sight. \nfeel about inside the shallow space.  The shriveled remains of dead flies -- a layer of dust -- and then a .30 handgun. \nSTU I'm -- touching something. \nVOICE One of the finest handguns Remington makes.  Lightweight, efficient and highly accurate. \nSTU I'm not picking it up. \nVOICE Not right now.  But eventually... \nStu lowers his hand, still empty. \nSTU I wouldn't have a chance. \nVOICE I never said you would. \nSTU I'm not insane. \nVOICE But you're getting there.  It wouldn't take much. \nSTU That won't happen. \nVOICE You could pull the gun down, shove it in your own mouth and jerk the trigger.  That's another option. \nSTU Why would I do that? \nVOICE To please me.  And ensure that nothing happens to Kelly.  I don't necessarily have to deal with her today in the midst of a crowd of cops.  I can take her out any time I like.  When she goes to pull down her blinds at night or when she walks the dog first thing in the morning.  What is it -- a Jack Russell? \nSTU Okay.  I know you can do it.  But don't talk about that.  Please. \nVOICE I'd rather see you remembered as the gallant gunman who tried to shoot his way past an army of police -- than as a coward who sucked the barrel.  I'm doing your PR for you.  Creating a final image that'll endure.  The outraged New Yorker who was pushed too far. When some lowlife street person tries to invade his territory, he retaliated.  And when the forces of the law closed in, he was defiant... to the end. \nSTU Like that nerdy sonofabitch who blew those three wiseass kids away on the subway? \nVOICE Exactly.  Nobody minded that he was a sicko.  He was living out a New Yorker's pet fantasy.  Can you remember that movie where Peter Finch started screaming 'I'm not taking it anymore!'  And everybody picked up on it. \nSTU 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not taking it anymore.' \nVOICE That was it.  Poor Finch got himself an Oscar for that.  But he was dead by then.  I mean he really died.  Maybe playing that part took too much out of him. \nSTU (softly to himself) 'I'm not taking it anymore.'  'I'm not taking it anymore.' \nVOICE That's the way!  Psyche yourself up.  Everybody respects a man who fights back, even if he goes a little berserk in the process. \nSTU Fighting back.  That's what it's about. \nVOICE Exactly!  We all understand the poor schmuck that gets laid off and comes back and shoots all his bosses.  We all thought of doing that.  But only he had the balls. The terminally ill husband who gets his policy canceled and machine guns the insurance company offices. Maybe somebody will finally get the message.  You can fuck human beings over only for so long before they come back at you.  I'm still holding on Kelly and she looks very concerned.  I could relieve all that anguish in a fraction of a second.  Shall I? \nStu is hearing these words but thinking only of what the man on the line has done to him.  His turn has come to fight back.  He has an idea. \nIf the sniper is focused on Kelly, he can't be watching Stu. \nTurning his back to the police, Stu slowly sinks to his knees. \nSTU I'm on my knees begging you. \nVOICE Stand up, Stu.  You're embarrassing yourself. \nTIGHT ANGLE -- \nStu now down on his knees in the booth.  He's curled up almost into a fetal position. \nStu talks close into the pay phone receiver now.  But keeps his voice raised. \nSTU This booth.  It's my whole world -- shrunk down to four feet by three feet.  Not much bigger than the size of a coffin. \nVOICE They can put handles on the booth and bury you in it. \nSTU (loudly into pay phone) When I saw you put that bullet into that black dude, I knew you'd never let me out of this phone booth alive. \nVOICE You're wasting my time.  Reach up and take the gun. \nSTU (peering upward, squinting) Let me see you first.  What harm can that do you?  You're in one of those windows.  I've got to know which one. \nVOICE No need for that. \nSTU Being so far, I could never identify you.  I don't even want to. \nVOICE What is it then? \nSTU Don't worry that I'd try to point you out.  You'd shut me up with one of your .30 calibre hollow points before I could even raise a finger. \nVOICE Why does it matter so much? \nSTU I want to see that you exist.  Like God exists.  It's not enough to believe.  You want to see him -- just once -- even at a distance. \nVOICE And then you'd take the gun down. And use it.  We have a deal on that? \nSTU Show yourself to me and I'll take the gun down.  I swear. \nThere's a pause as the sniper mulls it over. \nVOICE I don't have to make deals.  And you're irritating me by trying to negotiate.  God doesn't have to prove anything.  He just strikes you down when he gets in the mood. \nSTU Stop!  I won't ask to see you anymore. \nVOICE I'm glad that's settled.  But look who else has showed up? \nSTU Who? \nVOICE I guess she saw the coverage on TV and just couldn't keep away. \nSTU What are you talking about? \nVOICE The 'hotel' just arrived.  And a very beautiful little hotel she is. Actually, I'd classify her as more of a motel. \nSTU Mavis?  I don't see her. \nVOICE She's too far back behind the police line.  But I've got a fine shot at her from up here. \nSTU You don't even know what she looks like. \nVOICE You're in an enviable position now, Stu.  You get to choose between them.  Tell me which one. \nSTU I can't. \nVOICE Which will it be?  Kelly or Mavis? Or should I simply select one? \nINSERT SHOT - THE CELL PHONE \nlying face up on the floor of the booth.  Is anybody listening? \nBACK TO STU \nRAMEY Intercept them.  Divert them to the hotel. \nSERGEANT It's done. \nRAMEY Send them in from the Forty-third Street side.  I don't want any activity the sniper might catch sight of.  He's probably high up and facing that booth.  He's got to continue to believe our full attention is focused on the man inside -- whoever the hell that poor bastard is. (to emergency operator) Hello 911 operator, I missed some of that.  Run it halfway back and repeat it. \nSTU'S VOICE (REPLAY) (faint) '... Like you did that pimp.  And that tourist last week.  But this time you want me to do the killing for you...' \nRAMEY (listening) Jesus... he's a dead man. \nBACK INSIDE PHONE BOOTH \nVOICE The police seem all excited about something, Stu. \nSTU Are they?  I wasn't looking. \nVOICE I can't wait any longer.  Say amen, then reach up for the gun.  When your hand comes down, I want to see it. \nSTU I'm too afraid. \nVOICE For once, be brave.  Surprise yourself. \nSTU I'm shaking all over. \nVOICE Guys in combat situations even shit their pants.  But they follow orders. \nSTU As soon as the cops see a gun, they'll open fire. \nVOICE Then I'd advise you to fire first. \nStu's arm goes up in a supreme act of willpower. \nHis fingers run along the two clouded plastic sheets that cover the roof of the booth.  It raises up easily at the middle where two sheets join. \nTIGHT INSERT SHOT \nThe space between the roof of the booth and the sheets of clouded plastic.  We see the fluorescent lighting fixture covered with dust.  The solitary object -- a cruel-looking weapon. \nNow Stu's fingertips protrude into the small space.  He touches the gun, brushes back and forth, feeling the roughness of the grip. \nTIGHT SHOT - STU'S FACE \nas below he continues to hesitate -- it's agony -- \nThe sweat pours down his forehead and his eyes are squeezed tightly shut.  He can already imagine the police bullets tearing into him. \nA POLICE SNIPER IS MOVING INTO POSITION. \nPOLICE SNIPER (into transmitter) Give me the word. \nRACK BACK TO STU - IN THE BOOTH \nHis arm still raised.  He hasn't brought it down with the gun in it.  Not yet.  He holds the pay phone receiver jammed up against his mouth. \nVOICE Hard part's over.  Drop your arm and point it like you'd point your finger and squeeze. \nSTU No.  You do it.  If you want me dead, then fucking murder me! \nVOICE Why must I keep invoking some poor girl's name every time we come to an impasse?  I'm focused back on Kelly again.  You're obviously not willing to trade your life for hers. \nSTU I am!  I'm doing it! \nHe drops the receiver so that it dangles again. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS RAMEY to where Stu lies surrounded by cops and medics.  He's stunned, but very much alive. \nMEDIC Don't try to sit up. \nSTU What was that? \nRAMEY (kneeling) Rubber bullet. \nMEDIC You'll have one hell of a nasty welt.  Busted rib.  Maybe a permanent scar there. \nSTU It couldn't hurt much more if you really shot me. \nRAMEY Somebody was going to and we thought it may as well be us. \nSTU Did you get him? \nRAMEY Sure as hell did.  Thanks to you. \nSTU Still alive? \nRAMEY Barely. \nMEDIC We'll be giving him a hypo for the pain.  It'll put him out for a while. \nKelly is now brought over by a female cop.  She drops to her knees beside Stu and tries to embrace him.  The medics restrain her. \nSTU It's okay.  I'm not really shot. \nKELLY I was so afraid.  I thought... \nSTU I thought so, too.  But we're going to be alright.  Both of us. \nKELLY Remember how you swore up and down you'd get me on TV?  Well, you did. I already got interviewed on Fox and Channel Eleven and they even want me on A.M. America tomorrow morning. \nSTU Bet you didn't think I could deliver on that. \nMEDIC Will you please let go of him, Miss? \nA gurney is wheeled over from a police ambulance.  The medic is about to administer the hypo but Stu pushes him away. \nSTU No.  No hypo.  I want to see him first. \nThe medics are now ready to lift Stu onto the gurney and cart him off.  But Stu struggles against them. \nRAMEY Relax.  The guy's dying. \nSTU That's why I've gotta talk to him. Please! \nRAMEY We'll see. \nMEDIC (to Kelly) You can ride with him in the ambulance. \nThe woman cop escorts Kelly to the waiting ambulance. \nRamey meanwhile tries to resume contact with the SWAT team inside the hotel. \nRAMEY This is Ramey.  Over.  This is Ramey.  Ten-Four. \nThere's nothing but static, mixed up feedback and multiple garbled voices on the other end of the line. \n", "test1_input": "STU Let's see.  Who does she like?  Who couldn't be reached to deny it? \nVOICE I'm anxious to see you in action. Don't keep me waiting. \nStu uses his cellular again. \nSTU (dialing) Sometimes you only get her service. (into cellular) Hi -- Stu Shepard.  Put me through. I've got hard news for her.  I can only talk to her directly.  But say it regards -- Liza. \nVOICE Liza?  That was imaginative. \nSTU (into cellular) No, I can't call back.  I'll have to lay in on somebody else. Alright, but I can't hang on long. (to pay phone) She's coming on. (to cellular) Liz, hello.  Sure I'll make it brief.  Killing two weeks ago in the theatre district?  Turn out a sniper did the job.  Yeah, a sniper with a rifle.  Now he's got another victim lined up.  Not just your anonymous New Yorker, but Liza. Now you can't call anybody or Ms. Minelli's dead meat and so am I. She's hostage in a phone booth right in the sniper's sights.  But he says he'll talk to you and let her walk.  I know it'll take balls to do this, but you're a fine and courageous newspaper woman... \nThere's a click.  Silence. \nSTU Hello?  Hello? (to pay phone) Either she's on her way over or she doesn't believe me. \nVOICE You weren't particularly convincing. \nSTU I didn't really believe in what I was saying. \nVOICE Because you don't really believe my Remington is pointed at you? \nSTU I do. \nVOICE You're ninety percent sure. \nSTU At least ninety-five percent, easy. \nVOICE Let me erase all doubt. \nSTU No.  Don't shoot. \nVOICE Control yourself, Stu.  Glance down at your chest.  What do you see. \nSTU Oh, my God.  A dot.  A fucking red dot. \nA tiny red dot now moves across Stu's chest. \nVOICE Like you've seen in the movies? \nSTU The laser dot.  Just before some poor bastard always gets blown away. \nVOICE Usually a supporting player.  That lovely but by now generic special effect of the bullet piercing the forehead. \nThe tiny red laser dot dances around Stu's chest and stomach -- the jumps up and remains between his eyes. \nVOICE This takes all the guesswork out of it.  You know exactly where to expect it before I even tighten my finger on the trigger. \nSTU Don't tighten.  Don't even tickle that fucking finger. \nVOICE How about Geraldo?  He's run his ass off to get in on this. \nSTU You're talking about the old Geraldo.  Look, I can try and reach cable NBC.  They're hungry. \nVOICE I'm disappointed.  I wanted to go first class. \nSTU They do a great job.  They'll haul a whole crew over to cover your surrender \"live.\" \nVOICE I never expressed interest in giving myself up.  There are so many other phone booths in the city.  I'm just getting warmed up. \nSTU That's entirely up to you.  Your choice.  I'm just trying to set you up with the proper communicator. (beat) I suppose Liza wasn't strong enough.  I should've said Madonna. \n", "test1_true": "Outside the booth, the angry black woman has returned, bringing with her a gaudily dressed pimp named LEON who looks like he means business.  He slams his fist against the glass, nearly shattering it. \nLEON Drag your baggy butt out of that booth.  We got business to conduct out of there. \nFELICIA He been in there all day. \nSTU I'm not through. \nLEON Hang up that receiver or I'll make you eat the fucking thing! \nSTU Fuck off or I'll call a cop. \nLEON Do you see one around here?  What you think I'm gonna be doing while you're waiting for a prowl car to get assigned?  I'm about to cut you a second asshole if you don't vacate those premises. \nSTU I can't. \nFELICIA He's got him a fucking cellular. What's he need to be on our booth for? \nSTU I can't explain it. \nLEON I'm not interested in your explanations even if you had any. \nHe withdraws a switchblade knife from his pocket but doesn't open it -- yet. \nLEON If I flick this, I use it. \nSTU I'll make it worth your while to go away.  How much do you want? \nLEON Make me an offer. \nSTU Thirty dollars.  It's all I've got in cash.  Take it and go. \nLEON You're offering to rent my phone booth?  For how long? \nSTU I don't know.  For as long as it takes. \nLEON What's so special in there? \nSTU Do you want the money? \nLEON Is that a genuine Rolex you've got on? \nSTU Come on, man.  That's my good watch. \nLEON That's what it's gonna take. \nSTU Then here.  Take the damn thing. \nLEON And the thirty! \nSTU Take it all. \nThe pimp pockets the watch and the money.  But doesn't go away. \nLEON Now I'm satisfied.  But you still got to deal with Felicia here.  I believe you spoke harshly to her. \nSTU I apologize. \nLEON And did her some injury. \nSTU An accident.  I'm sorry about that, too. \n", "test1_id": 441, "test2_input": "MEDIC Nothing we can do.  Don't touch the body.  They'll need it to mark the crime scene. \nFar across the street, the Captain confers with his subordinates.  They are small figures on the screen but we hear them sharply. \nSERGEANT Same corner as two weeks ago. \nRAMEY Maybe it's more than a coincidence. Cover me.  I need to talk to him. \nSERGEANT You've got your vest on? \nRAMEY What do you think? \nThe Captain steps out of cover and boldly approaches the phone booth.  He stops cautiously about fifteen feet away. \nRAMEY I'm not armed. \nSTU Neither am I. \nRAMEY Yeah, sure.  I need to know what happened. \nSTU Can't talk about it. \nRAMEY Sure you can.  My name's Ramey. Captain Ed Ramey.  What's yours? \nSTU Look, I don't want to be friends. \nRAMEY You look like you need a friend. \nVOICE Tell him you've already got a friend. \nSTU (yells) I've got a friend, okay. \nRAMEY Is that who you're talking to on the phone? \nSTU None of your business. \nRAMEY When somebody gets shot, it becomes my business.  Let's not have anybody else killed.  I want to hear your side of it. \nSTU I've got no side of it. \nVOICE Don't worry, Stu.  I've got him fixed right in my sights.  I won't let him hurt you. \nRAMEY Has this happened to you before? The need to hurt someone?  To put a bullet in them? \nSTU You won't believe anything I say. \nRAMEY Try me. \nSTU I couldn't shoot anybody.  I'm not armed. \nRAMEY You're right.  I don't believe you. What's that bulge in your pants pocket? \nSTU That?  That's my cellular. \nRAMEY A cellular?  Then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls? \nSTU Do you want to see it? \nRAMEY Don't reach for it, mister. \nSTU Then how can I show it to you? \n", "test2_true": "From behind a parked car, a HOMELESS PERSON calls out. \nSTREET PERSON (hollers) Damn straight! \nAnother DERELICT, crouched in a doorway, joins in. \nDERELICT (shouts) Yeah!  Shot him down like a dog! \nSTU They're all lying.  Nobody saw it because it didn't happen. \nRAMEY A man is dead but it didn't happen. \nSTU Not on account of me!  This is like some bad dream. \nRAMEY You're walking through a bad dream and you can't wake up.  Do you want to wake up? \nSTU I'm trying. \nRAMEY And in this dream, you killed that man.  He was bothering you so you iced him. \nSTU No. \nRAMEY Then who did? \nVOICE Don't tell him, Stu.  Or it'll be the last thing he ever hears.  His blood will be on your hands. \nSTU (to Ramey) I don't know. \nRAMEY But you saw it happen? \nSTU Yes. \nRAMEY You were the closest one to him. You must've seen who did it. \nSTU No. \nRAMEY We're trying to be honest with each other, aren't we? \nSTU Not necessarily. \nVOICE I'm losing patience with this cop. \nSTU (into phone) I'm handling this. \nRAMEY Who do you keep talking to on the phone? \nSTU Nobody.  My psychiatrist. \nVOICE Excellent, Stu.  You're getting good at this. \nRAMEY What's this doctor's name?  It's important we know. \nSTU He says not to tell you.  It's privileged information. \nVOICE Damn good reply.  Now you're having fun.  Admit it. \nSTU Whatever you say. \nVOICE Playing it so close to the edge. I'll bet you've never felt so alive.

Turn around and keep those hands clasped. (signals the others) Take him. \nThe SWAT OFFICERS in protective gear now step out of cover and fan out as they approach the booth. \nTIGHTER ON STU \nHe's just outside the booth -- expecting to feel the sniper's bullet go through him at any moment. \nThen the pay phone starts ringing. \nThe sniper is calling back. \nRACK FOCUS AGAIN \nto the police. \nAll the cops react.  Particularly the Captain and the Sergeant.  Their voices seem close up when they sharpen in focus. \nSERGEANT What is going on with these fucking phone calls? \nRAMEY (shouts) Hold your fire.  Let him answer it. \nThe SWAT team backs up but maintain their aim. \nSERGEANT Are you nuts? \nRAMEY Let them talk.  He's not going anywhere. (shouts) He's going back inside the booth. \nIndeed we see Stu re-enter the battered phone booth and pick up the receiver. \nFOCUS RETURNS TO STU \nSTU (into pay phone) Yeah? \nA strange voice begins chattering away in Spanish.  Totally unintelligible to Stu. \nSTU (into pay phone) You got the wrong number.  Hang up. \nThe voice, probably a Puerto Rican gentleman, rattles on in Spanish. \nSTU Wrong number.  Wrong number. \nThen the voice on the phone suddenly alters the Hispanic accent.  It is the now familiar tone of his tormentor. \nVOICE Aw, relax, Stu.  Only yanking your chain.  Now can we start over? \nSTU Those cops won't wait much longer. \nVOICE What else can they do?  They can't afford to just shoot you like I can.  Not with so much media coverage.  Not unless you make some stupid aggressive move. (beat) The ABC Mobile Unit just rolled up. \nAcross the street, Stu can see various TV units from local stations setting up cameras on roofs of trucks. \nSTU Will you look at that?  I must be going out over the network.  Bet they're pre-empting usual programming. \nVOICE And just think -- if you survive this, your trial will be televised. And you can try and make the world believe I ever existed.  I'd be your only defense. \nSTU How are they gonna prove that I killed anybody when there's no gun? \nVOICE They'll plant one.  The police aren't above that -- when they're desperate to convict. \nSTU No, sir.  No gun and I walk. \n", "test3_true": "STU What do you mean? \nVOICE Haven't I considered every eventuality?  I knew they'd come and cordon off the block. (beat) And that there'd have to be a gun someplace. \nSTU Where? \nVOICE It's a small booth, Stu.  Have you checked every inch of it? \nSTU (looking up and down) It's not on the floor. \nVOICE Then what's left? \nSTU Up above. \nVOICE Could be.  Why don't you reach up there and lift the plastic sheet -- and feel around. \nSTU If they see me reach for something, they could open fire. \nVOICE They could.  But you have to know if it's there.  Don't you? \nSTU I totally don't give a shit. \nVOICE In a narrow space, tucked just to the left of the fluorescent bulb. You can almost see it outlined if you look closely. \nStu peers upward at the clouded plastic, now stained and dirty.  There are shadows of objects above in the shallows area around the light fixture that automatically goes on when the door to the phone booth is tightly closed. \nStu opens and closes the door a few times, watching the light click on -- watching the shadows around the light. \nCould that be an accumulation of dirt, dust, or dead insects? Or could something be stashed up there? \nSTU It doesn't matter.  I know about ballistics.  The slug in that dead guy came from your rifle, not any handgun. \nVOICE You saw how hollow points splinter on impact.  There's nothing much for ballistics to match to.  The same make .30 calibre bullets are in that handgun.  The prosecution rests. \nSTU There's no gun up there.  I don't see a damn thing. \nVOICE Slide your finger up under the plastic and you'll feel the cold metal surface.  There are four rounds left in it.  Should you decide to shoot your way out. \nSTU I could never shoot anybody. \nVOICE You could shoot me, Stu.  You'd do that in a minute if you could. \nSTU And I'd fucking love it! \nVOICE Now you're speaking from the heart. Come on, just lift the partition a few inches and feel what's there for you. \nSTU I'm not getting my fingerprints on your fucking weapon.  What about powder residue?  How are they going to explain that to a jury? \nVOICE Do you think that'll matter with so many eye witnesses? (beat) Do it... or should I re-focus my attention on Kelly? \nSTU No. \nVOICE You carefully distracted me from her before and I let you get away with it.  But if you're not going to play fairly -- (a pause) There she is again.  So close I feel like I could touch her. \nSTU Get off her! \nVOICE Then mind me when I speak. \nSTU Look!  I'm reaching up with my left hand.  I'm pushing against the partition.  It's giving.  I'm feeling around with my fingertips. It's filthy up there. \nTIGHT SHOT - STU'S FINGERS \n", "test3_id": 443}

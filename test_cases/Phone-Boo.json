{"test1_input": "INSIDE THE BOOTH, Stu inserts his thirty-five cents and dials. \nSTU Hello, Mavis, sweet creature. \nMAVIS' VOICE Where have you been?  Do you think I have nothing to do but wait around for you to call? \nSTU I'm only a few minutes late, loveliest individual on earth. \nMAVIS' VOICE Stu, I'm so lonely.  When can I see you? \nSTU Good news in that arena.  Kelly goes into rehearsal as of Monday. You know how dedicated she is.  By the time she gets back from dancing her ass off, she goes right to sleep.  We'll have both our days and certain nights.  Not to mention when they take the show on the road. \nMAVIS' VOICE How long is that for? \nSTU Four to five weeks -- minimum. \nMAVIS' VOICE Maybe I should quit my job so we can be together full time. \nSTU I wouldn't do that. \nMAVIS' VOICE Sometimes I think if I have to give one more fucking manicure... \nSTU That's how you met me. \nMAVIS' VOICE I never saw a worse set of nails. Bit right down to the quick. \nSTU I'm much better groomed since you've been looking after me. \nMAVIS' VOICE I'm glad you admit it. \nSTU Even Kelly remarked on it when I first met her. \nMAVIS' VOICE She could care less how you look. She's only interested in pushing her own career.  Some wife you're stuck with! \nSTU The marriage is not without its compensations.  Do you imagine I could afford that apartment on what I'm earning?  Not with everybody cutting back on the publicity.  Not to mention a million college graduates coming into the profession trying to cut me out. And one thing you can't expect from your clients is loyalty.  They get a couple of bad notices, they dump you.  Goodbye. \nMAVIS' VOICE Don't go. \nSTU I wasn't saying goodbye to you.  I was saying how the clients try to give you the wave off without even a month's notice. \nA conservative businessman now stands outside the booth waiting to use it.  He deliberately glances at his watch a few times to demonstrate his impatience.  This bothers Stu who slides the booth open a crack. \nSTU (yelling) What?  Is your watch busted?  It's twenty after eleven and I'm gonna be occupied indefinitely with my transaction.  So get out of my face! \nHe closes the booth up again and turns his back to the gentleman who gives up and departs. \nSTU Sorry, honey.  There will be no further interruption. \nMAVIS' VOICE Why must you always be calling me from some booth? \nSTU On account of that phone records are regularly subpoenaed in divorce proceedings.  And I don't want some entry showing up on my cellular bill either.  She gets the mail. She looks these items over. Sometimes she even dials up a strange number to see who it is. \nMAVIS' VOICE Then she suspects something. \nSTU It's only because her last husband, the choreographer, ran around on her.  She can't get that out of her head.  That's how she caught onto him.  The phone bills. \nMAVIS' VOICE She hasn't developed much skill at holding a man. \nSTU You know what a self-fulfilling prophecy is?  She was so sure I was going to find me a woman that she finally drove me back to you.  I thought I'd feel all guilty about it -- but I guess it hasn't kicked in yet. (beat) Still, I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.  Basically, Kelly's a decent individual. \nMAVIS' VOICE What about hurting me?  Like last time? \n", "test1_true": "MAVIS' VOICE For a while I was, 'til I took stock of what was around.  You're the lesser of many evils. \nSTU That's about the nicest thing you ever said. \nMAVIS' VOICE I'll have it engraved. \nSTU We've been up front with each other from the beginning.  Let's keep it that way.  How about a drink?  Say seven o'clock?  The Monkey Bar? \nMAVIS' VOICE Meet me in front.  I don't like walking in there unescorted. \nSTU Yeah, you're great enough looking to be mistaken for one of those thousand dollar a night girls. \nMAVIS' VOICE It happens all the time lately. \nSTU And wear that short black number I bought you from Bendel's. \nMAVIS' VOICE Again?  I don't know if it's me or that dress you like. \nSTU Have a good day.  Make plenty of tips.  And leave the whole evening open.  She thinks I've got Knicks tickets. \nHe hangs up.  Then whips a tiny cellular phone out of his jacket pocket, flips it open and dials.  Someone answers on the first ring. \nCOLUMNIST (V.O.) Speak! \nSTU (into cellular) It's your boy Stuart.  When was the last time I called you for a favor? \nCOLUMNIST (V.O.) The column is already full. \nSTU I just need one line.  Anybody you wanna say was seen dining out at Mario's Stromboli restaurant. \nCOLUMNIST (V.O.) Maybe you don't hear so good?  I got no space for you. \nSTU Who's asking any favors?  I'm offering reciprocal information. \nCOLUMNIST (V.O.) Since when were you ever a reliable source? \nSTU Check it out.  Tony award-winning producer Willie Beagle tossed his wife back into rehab again following her third attempt at diving off the terrace at their plush eighteen room residence at the San Remo.  I got it from the doorman. \nCOLUMNIST (V.O.) I got it from their maid yesterday. It's in the paper today.  Or don't you bother to read my shit? \nSTU Louis, my intentions were entirely honorable. \nCOLUMNIST (V.O.) I'll drop your item in sometime next week.  If you promise not to call me for a month. \nHe hangs up.  Stu looks pleased as he folds the cell phone and tucks it away. \nThen he starts to vacate the booth.  The phone rings.  And rings.  Curious, he picks up the receiver.  There's a voice on the other end of the line.  A DISTINCTIVE MALE VOICE. \nVOICE Don't even think about leaving that booth. \nSTU What? \nVOICE Stay exactly where you are and listen carefully. \nSTU I've got a heavy day, mister. \nVOICE You know better than to disobey me. \nSTU I don't know you at all. \nVOICE Are you absolutely sure? \n", "test1_id": 441, "test2_input": "VOICE Maybe you are one of them. \nSTU Hey, I have worked in a boiler room myself peddling \"Term Life.\"  I Would never be rude to a fellow salesperson. \nVOICE Can you feel it on you now?  The heat of it.  I'm moving the strike zone down to your stomach area. Now I'm raising it up again. Directly above the chest cavity -- sliding up to the forehead just above the left ear. \nSTU Shit -- I do feel it. \nVOICE Tell me where I'm going with it now. \nSTU Across my forehead -- now back where it was before. \nVOICE I'm amazed how you can do that. You're amazingly accurate. (beat) Now I know what you're thinking. If I drop down on the floor of the booth and flatten myself out... \nSTU No, I'm not thinking that. \nVOICE Oh yes you are.  Can I crawl out using the booth as a shield?  Can I crawl to that Chrysler illegally parked only three or four feet away?  The shattering glass may cut me, but it'll only be superficial. Otherwise, this lunatic will never let me out alive. \nSTU No.  You will.  I know you will. If I just cooperate. \nVOICE Where is it now?  Think and feel for the warm spot. \nSTU Below the shoulder? \nVOICE Which one? \nSTU The right shoulder. \nVOICE Remarkable how we're in tune. You're doing far better than the others. \nSTU What others?  What do you mean? (no reply) You said 'others!' \nVOICE (finally) I'm sure you read about the Italian tourist shot dead ten days ago at the corner of Forty-fifth and Eighth? \nSTU I saw it on the news. \nVOICE And where are we now? \nSTU Oh, God.  Forty-fifth and Eighth. \nVOICE What else do you remember about that killing? \nSTU I don't know. \nVOICE Try. \nSTU He was gunned down.  And nobody was caught.  And they didn't even bother to take his wallet or his watch... or anything. \nVOICE Now you know why.  It wasn't a robbery. \nSTU What did he do? \nVOICE He hung up -- so I disconnected him permanently. \nSTU Please -- don't do it to me.  You got no reason to do it to me. \nVOICE Don't give me reason. \nSTU I'm not looking to.  Tell me what you want! \nVOICE Tell me about your job. \n", "test2_true": "VOICE What do you do, exactly? \nSTU Plant items in the paper and on the tube.  More important sometimes, keep stuff out. \nVOICE What've you kept out? \nSTU One of my people got nailed for indecent exposure.  I managed for the cops to use his real name instead of his stage name so nobody picked up on it. \nVOICE You saved the little deviate's ass, didn't you? \nSTU He's in major therapy now.  I swear he is. \nVOICE You must hang with some major celebrities.  Journalists, newscasters -- those types. \nSTU I'm real close with Larry King. And the \"Hard Copy\" people. \nVOICE Could you get him down here?  Larry King? \nSTU Why would he want to come here? \nVOICE Because you asked him to. \nSTU He comes from Atlanta. \nVOICE Well, who could you get? \nSTU I don't know. \nVOICE Wolf Blitzer? \nVOICE Probably not. \nVOICE Regis? \nSTU Definitely no chance. \nVOICE You'd be offering them an exclusive newsbreak.  I'm talking about more than one homicide. \nSTU How many? \nVOICE I don't answer questions.  I ask them. \nSTU I gotta have the facts.  They might not believe me.  My record isn't too good when it comes to hard news. \nVOICE You're not considered a reliable source? \nSTU On a divorce or separation, maybe. Or who's gay, or who isn't gay any more.  I kind of specialize in that kind of material.  I mean I could probably get you Joe Franklin. \nVOICE How about Cindy Adams? \nSTU I might have a shot.  Are you familiar with Liz Smith? \nVOICE Do you know her number? \nSTU Want I should call her?  How much can I say? \nVOICE Tell her you're in direct touch with a killer who's willing to speak honestly if she shows up here alone and without notifying the authorities. \nSTU She usually likes to have a celebrity involved.  If you had an actor or a sports figure held prisoner instead of me, there'd be better odds she's come. \nVOICE Then lie.  Pick a celebrity and put them in the booth. \n", "test2_id": 442, "test3_input": "feel about inside the shallow space.  The shriveled remains of dead flies -- a layer of dust -- and then a .30 handgun. \nSTU I'm -- touching something. \nVOICE One of the finest handguns Remington makes.  Lightweight, efficient and highly accurate. \nSTU I'm not picking it up. \nVOICE Not right now.  But eventually... \nStu lowers his hand, still empty. \nSTU I wouldn't have a chance. \nVOICE I never said you would. \nSTU I'm not insane. \nVOICE But you're getting there.  It wouldn't take much. \nSTU That won't happen. \nVOICE You could pull the gun down, shove it in your own mouth and jerk the trigger.  That's another option. \nSTU Why would I do that? \nVOICE To please me.  And ensure that nothing happens to Kelly.  I don't necessarily have to deal with her today in the midst of a crowd of cops.  I can take her out any time I like.  When she goes to pull down her blinds at night or when she walks the dog first thing in the morning.  What is it -- a Jack Russell? \nSTU Okay.  I know you can do it.  But don't talk about that.  Please. \nVOICE I'd rather see you remembered as the gallant gunman who tried to shoot his way past an army of police -- than as a coward who sucked the barrel.  I'm doing your PR for you.  Creating a final image that'll endure.  The outraged New Yorker who was pushed too far. When some lowlife street person tries to invade his territory, he retaliated.  And when the forces of the law closed in, he was defiant... to the end. \nSTU Like that nerdy sonofabitch who blew those three wiseass kids away on the subway? \nVOICE Exactly.  Nobody minded that he was a sicko.  He was living out a New Yorker's pet fantasy.  Can you remember that movie where Peter Finch started screaming 'I'm not taking it anymore!'  And everybody picked up on it. \nSTU 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not taking it anymore.' \nVOICE That was it.  Poor Finch got himself an Oscar for that.  But he was dead by then.  I mean he really died.  Maybe playing that part took too much out of him. \nSTU (softly to himself) 'I'm not taking it anymore.'  'I'm not taking it anymore.' \nVOICE That's the way!  Psyche yourself up.  Everybody respects a man who fights back, even if he goes a little berserk in the process. \nSTU Fighting back.  That's what it's about. \nVOICE Exactly!  We all understand the poor schmuck that gets laid off and comes back and shoots all his bosses.  We all thought of doing that.  But only he had the balls. The terminally ill husband who gets his policy canceled and machine guns the insurance company offices. Maybe somebody will finally get the message.  You can fuck human beings over only for so long before they come back at you.  I'm still holding on Kelly and she looks very concerned.  I could relieve all that anguish in a fraction of a second.  Shall I? \nStu is hearing these words but thinking only of what the man on the line has done to him.  His turn has come to fight back.  He has an idea. \nIf the sniper is focused on Kelly, he can't be watching Stu. \nTurning his back to the police, Stu slowly sinks to his knees. \nSTU I'm on my knees begging you. \nVOICE Stand up, Stu.  You're embarrassing yourself. \nTIGHT ANGLE -- \nStu now down on his knees in the booth.  He's curled up almost into a fetal position. \n", "test3_true": "He half expects to hear a shot ring out either from the sniper or the cops.  But nothing happens. \nVOICE Stu -- I want you back on your feet facing me.  So you can see what I'm going to do to her. \nStu ignores the command.  He's quickly dialing. \nHe's calling police emergency. \nSNIPER'S POV \nStu seen through the cross hairs of the sniperscope, crouched, doubled up at the foot of the booth.  But the cell phone is hidden in front of him. \nVOICE Be a man, Stuart.  Don't let them see you like this.  You're an embarrassment to me. \nWIDER SHOT - THE BOOTH \nwith Stu still kneeling. \nRACK FOCUS \nto police across the street as their voices become clear -- \nSERGEANT (listening to transmission) Officer on east side of the street reports subject removed a dark metallic object from his pocket. We better move. \nRAMEY Hold all fire until you actually identify a weapon.  We're doing this on fucking TV! \nRACK FOCUS BACK TO -- STU IN THE BOOTH \ncrouched forward.  The pay phone receiver dangles just above his head.  The cellular remains cupped in his hand. \nStu never lifts the cell phone.  He keeps the palm of his hand over the speaker of the phone to muffle any sound from the other end. \nIt rings and finally someone answers. \nEMERGENCY OPERATOR (faint) Police.  Is this an emergency? Hello?  Is someone on the line? \nBut Stu addresses himself loudly to the pay phone which he now grips in his other hand.  Hoping that his words will be picked up by the emergency operator listening via the cellular.  To help in this regard, he reaches back and slides the door to the booth tightly closed. \nHe pretends to be talking to the sniper but his words are meant for the 911 operator to hear. \nSTU (loud) You've made your point.  Who's going to believe I've got a sniper with a telescopic sight holding me in a fucking phone booth at 45th and 8th? \nVOICE It took you a while to believe it yourself. \nSTU If you'd put a bullet in that Captain Ramey, it would've been a different story -- but you were too wise to do that. \nVOICE Why don't you do it for me?  Wave the old captain back over and get him nice and close and then use the handgun on him. \nSTU (talking loud) Why me?  You could pick off any of those cops from your window up there.  Like you did that pimp. And that tourist last week.  But this time you want me to do your killing for you. \nVOICE And you will!  To save Kelly. \nEXTREME TIGHT SHOT - CELL PHONE \ncupped in Stu's hand and held low.  Can they hear him on the other end? \nEMERGENCY OPERATOR (muffled, almost inaudible) Can you speak up, sir?  What is your name? \nStu is concerned that the sniper might hear the voice of the emergency operator.  He sets the cell phone down flat on the floor of the booth facing upward.  He puts his foot over the receiving end to muffle the incoming voice.  Then he stands up. \nVOICE That's better, Stu.  Now turn around so I can see you. \n", "test3_id": 443}

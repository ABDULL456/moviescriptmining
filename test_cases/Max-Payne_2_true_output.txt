BB I learned something from your father, years ago. Always give people a choice. 
tepping into the intersection, BB stops. Abruptly, Joe Salle closes with Max, meaty hand clamping onto his arm. 
BB He gave me the choice between early retirement or facing the charges he was going to bring against me. He sat me down in that bar and explained that I could either give up the thing I loved, or I could have it taken away by force. That (was my choice. beat) (MORE)

BB(CONT'D) You could have put a gun in your mouth any time you wanted. Or, you could have kept living in the hell I made for you. That's your choice. 
BB smiles. 
BB Just out of curiosity, though: why don't I have a chance now? 
Max's eyes are clear - almost peaceful for the first time. 
MAX Because now I know it's you. 
BB moves closer, the arrogance in his smile deepening. 
BB Well, you're-- 
Suddenly, Max launches himself forward - a fullback's explosion into the line that catches Salle by surprise... 
Hands cuffed behind his back, Max drives his shoulder into BB's jaw, splitting his lip. BB tumbles back into the snow. 
Joe brings the club out again, bashing Max across the head, using it to choke Max until his struggles lose power. 
JOE SALLE Okay, enough. This is far enough. 
BB looks around, wiping the blood from his lip. His eyes fall on a mound of construction rubble in a vacant lot. B B Hang on. 
JOE SALLE BB... 
BB stands and walks onto the lot, kicking away snow until he exhumes a cinder block in the rubble pile. BB picks it up. 
BB 've got something better. 
Carrying the cinder block, BB starts off down a different street. Grudgingly, Salle pushes Max along after him. 
Visible a few blocks away, the black body of the river waits.

EXT. PIER - NIGHT 
An ancient shipping pier juts out into the river, murky water high and roiling around its pilings from the stormy weather. B B motions for Max and Joe Salle to follow him out onto the pier, its planks buried under a thick sheet of ice. 
BB (to Salle, taking Max) Grab me some of that rope. 
BB drops the cinder block at Max's feet, CRACKING the ice. 
BB It's not like we didn't see it coming. 
Clamping onto Max's arm, BB unlocks his handcuffs. 
BB Sullen, withdrawn...Max just never seemed the same after the tragedy. 
ights running the length of the pier flicker, eventually dying altogether. All down the shore, the power fails. 
BB It's a good thing his father didn't live to see it, though. Bill Payne's only son, a strung-out suicide. 
idden in the now deeper darkness, BB pulls something from his coat: two glass vials like Lupino's, filled with the same green powder. He tucks them into Max's coat pocket. 
BB smiling) It would have eaten him alive. 
MAX Bravura's not going to buy it. 
BB Sure? Not even once the autopsy turns up traces in your blood? 
Max looks at BB, trying to understand how that could be. 
BB dosed you that night at Alex's, just to make sure things were fuzzy. Compliments of the house.

Seeing that BB has removed Max's cuffs, Salle hurries over. The motion puts both men off balance on the slick boards... 
BB oe, why don't you calm down...

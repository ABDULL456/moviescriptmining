Randy, on a post-match high, sits on a cafeteria table enjoying a beer as a pseudo-MEDIC stitches up his hairline gash. Nick Volpe wanders over. 
MEDIC Ram, man, you popped that crowd. 
Randy smiles contentedly. He sure did. 
NICK VOLPE (O.S.) Yo, Ram. Got a sec? 
Nick Volpe comes over. 
RANDY For you, needledick? Always. 
NICK VOLPE Do you realize what's coming up? 
Randy looks at him, unsure. 
NICK VOLPE (CONT'D) May 6th... 
Randy racks his brains. He has no idea. 
NICK VOLPE (CONT'D) 20th anniversary of you and Ayatollah at the Garden. 
RANDY (AMAZED) Holy shit... 
NICK VOLPE I know. Time fuckin' flies. 
Randy sees an excited smile creep across Volpe's face. 
RANDY Whatcha thinkin'? 
NICK VOLPE Two words: Re. Match. 
Randy is instantly intrigued. 
NICK VOLPE (CONT'D) I'm doing a big Fanfest thing down in South Carolina that weekend. I wanna main-event it with you two. 
RANDY Yeah? 
NICK VOLPE Ram-Ayatollah II. 20th anniversary. Hundreds, thousands of screaming fans watching you two make history for the second time. 
RANDY Think Bob'd get back in there? He's pretty retired. 
NICK VOLPE For this? (cool, confident nod) I bet he'd be willing to dust off the old turban. 
Randy's mouth is practically watering. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CHEETAH'S - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER 
A spring in his hobbled step, Randy gets out of the van and heads toward Cheetah's, the strip club he passed earlier. Manning the door is BIG CHRIS, a huge bouncer/doorman. 
BIG CHRIS Whassup, Ram? How ya been? 
RANDY Yo, Big Chris. 
They chummily shake hands. Big Chris pulls Randy in tight. 
BIG CHRIS (into Randy's ear) Hey, can you get me any more of that IGF-1? 
RANDY What do I look like, some fuckin' two-bit street dealer? 
BIG CHRIS C'mon, hook a brother up. You get the family discount. 
RANDY Swing by the mansion. Any day this week. 
BIG CHRIS You da man, Ram! 
INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER 
MUSIC: BIRDMAN & LIL WAYNE - "STUNTIN' LIKE MY DADDY" 
A crowded, not-very-glamorous Jersey strip club. Randy stands over by the bar. The female BARTENDER slides him a beer. 
RANDY Thanks, hon. 
Randy takes a swig, looking around the club. 
RANDY (CONT'D) Cassidy around? 
BARTENDER I think she's VIP-in'. 
Randy, nodding, takes his beer and heads over toward the STAGE. He settles in at an open table. 
ON STAGE: 
A YOUNG STRIPPER (22) works the pole, grinding lewdly to "Stuntin' Like My Daddy", a bass-heavy Dirty South rap song. 
RANDY: 
Randy, watching her, quickly grows bored. He finds the stripper, like the song, crude and soulless. 
INT. CHEETAH'S - MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Randy is at the urinal. He flushes and heads over to the sink. He washes his hands, checking his look in the mirror. He primps a little. 
INT. CHEETAH'S - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

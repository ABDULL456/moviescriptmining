{"test1_input": "WHO'S YOUR DADDY \nWritten by \nMaria Veltre & Jack Sekowski \nFADE IN: \nEXT. ABOVE THE CLOUDS - DAY \nWe fly high above heavenly clouds.  Beneath a brilliant blue sky.  A TEENAGED BOY'S VOICE greets us... \nTED NELSON (V.O.) On any given day, your life can change in the blink of an eye. It's a clich\u00e9, I know... \nDescending through the clouds, we are caught for a moment in a dreamy gauze.  We emerge to find ourselves gliding above a small town.  Descending lower.  And lower.  To Xenia, Ohio. \nTED (V.O.) ...But a lot of clich\u00e9s get to be clich\u00e9s because they're true. Your life CAN change in the blink of an eye.  What I mean is, one day you're a regular chump, a wannabe something.  You're not even totally sure WHAT you wannabe... \nWe pass over the town square. A fine spring day in middle America. Red brick buildings with names like \"Miller & Son Drugs,\" \"Two Sisters Gifts,\" \"Nelson Family Market.\"   You can almost smell the rosy cheeks and moral fiber. \nTED (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...The next day the doorbell rings and some stranger's holding your ticket to being SOMEBODY. \nStill flying over the town, we focus on a TEENAGED BOY on a Schwinn.  We follow as he pedals his way to... \nTECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL \nA three story building.  Older, brick, sturdy.  Meticulously maintained. \nTED (V.O.) It happens every day.  Dreams come true.  And not just for those dim witted chain-smoking hillbillies you see on TV.  You know, the ones who win the Super Lotto and spend their fortune on a truck full of Goobers and a new set of front teeth.  It could happen to any guy, any time...even ME. \nEXT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nA JANITOR raises the American flag.  It flaps proudly as the teenager chains his bike to a bike rack. He glances up at the flag, which is reflected in his uber-hip sunglasses.  When he smiles, in SLOW MO, his teeth seem to sparkle. \nTED (V.O.) Uh, that's not me.  I'm over here. \nWe SWISH PAN to another teenager, locking his bike.  Meet our much less glamorous hero:  TED NELSON, 17.  A decent looking kid.  Not hip enough to be cool.  Not square enough to be tormented. He joins the other KIDS heading into the school. \nTED (V.O.) (CONT'D) You're disappointed, I know. I admit, I was hopeless back then. The 'do, the shades, ugh. But I always had good taste in women. \nINT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY \nCHRISTY MALONE, 17, fills her cheerleader uniform in all the right places. We watch her at her locker. Also in SLOW MO. Which makes even her most mundane task seem graceful. Wow, just look at her stack those books. \nTED (V.O.) That's Christy Malone.  Head cheerleader, love of my life, lust of my loins. \nChristy glances off screen and SQUEALS excitedly.  Another cheerleader enters the frame, holding a newspaper called \"EXPOSED!\"  Christy reads the headline. \nCHRISTY \"Health Teacher Flunks Her Own Lesson!\"  No WAY!  It's Miss Pratt, smoking a doobie! \nChristy calls to Ted.... \nCHRISTY (CONT'D) Look at this, Ted! Imagine if we did THIS in the school paper! \nShe shows him \"Exposed!\" Ted gawks. Happy just to be this close to Christy. But they are quickly interrupted by... \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN (O.S.) Hand them over! Immediately! \nPRINCIPAL RICHARD MERKIN, mid-50's, marches down the hallway, seizing copies of \"EXPOSED!\" from students' hands. We can see that it is a \"homemade\" looking newspaper. And there's obviously much ado about it.  Christy winks at Ted as she hides the newspaper in her locker. \nFREEZE FRAME ON Christy, WINKING. \nTED (V.O.) Look at that smile.  That wink. That's no platonic wink. That's a wink that says, \"I don't just want you, Ted. I NEED you.\" So of course I had to ask her to the prom. I mean, she was practically begging for it. \nINT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - NEWSROOM - DAY \nTed ambles toward Christy. Struggling for nonchalance.  She limbers up by stretching her leg high against the wall. She whispers to another CHEERLEADER.  They giggle.  Then Christy turns to Ted.  Flashing that perfect smile of hers. \nCHRISTY Just the guy I've been looking for. \nTed wipes his sweaty palms on his jeans... \nTED I've been looking for you, too. \nChristy continues stretching.  Driving Ted crazy with her contortionist moves. \n", "test1_true": "TED (sotto) From your lips, to God's ears. \nCHRISTY You go first. \nTED \nLadies first.  I insist. \nCHRISTY Well. The prom's coming up. \nTED Yeah? \nCHRISTY And I was wondering. \nTED Yeah? \nCHRISTY If you don't have...I mean... \nShe looks up at him with gorgeous blue eyes. Then blurts... \nCHRISTY (CONT'D) Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom? \nTED SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course. \nChristy joyously jumps into Ted's arms.  Wrapping her legs around him in a passionate embrace.  The entire room APPLAUDS. \nCHRISTY You are the most wonderful guy in the whole wide world, and I love you madly, Teddy Nelson! \nAnd just as she's about to plant one right on his lips... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. TED'S OFFICE - NEWSROOM - DAY \nThe shrill ringing of a TORNADO DRILL ALARM snaps Ted out of his reverie. A large glass window separates Ted's EDITOR-IN CHIEF office from the rest of the school newsroom.  We realize now that Ted has only been gazing through the window at Christy, watching her stretch those gorgeous limbs of hers. \nTED (V.O.) Sorry about that.  A cheap trick, I know.  But it's my story and my fantasy. So cut me some slack. \nHe follows the other students to... \nINT. CORRIDOR - TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nTed joins his schoolmates, lining up on both sides of the hallway.  Far from any windows. They all know the drill. Christy's just across the hall from Ted.  He can't take his eyes off of her. \nCHARLIE DUKE, 17, approaches Ted.  He's got a camera around his neck and so much confidence, it's a wonder he can balance his head on his shoulders. \nCHARLIE Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation... \nTED You and your pep talks. \nCHARLIE Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for. \nFREEZE FRAME ON CHARLIE. \nTED (V.O.) That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer... \nINT. BASKETBALL COURT - TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nCharlie kneels by the sidelines.  Shooting cheerleaders with his Nikon and an obscenely long lens. \nTED (V.O.) ...a very gifted photographer. \nTHROUGH CHARLIE'S LENS: \nA cheerleader's ripe buttocks, peeking out from beneath a short pleated skirt.  As she kicks and jumps, her little red panties wedge themselves firmly between her cheeks. The camera skillfully tracks her movements, waiting until... \nThe cheerleader's hand comes down.  In SLOW MO, her finger slips under her panties and tugs on the fabric, pulling it over her cheeks.  Charlie's motor drive whirls. \nRAPID STILL SHOTS OF THE CHEERLEADER'S BOTTOM \nTED (V.O.) The senior class voted him, \"Most Likely To Have A Restraining Order Filed Against Him.\" But that's another story. \nBACK TO CORRIDOR \nTed and Charlie lean against the wall. \n", "test1_id": 1230, "test2_input": "The Masseuses help Uncle Billy out of the Jacuzzi. They say their goodnights and Ted closes his eyes. When he opens them, Ginger stands at the edge of the tub. \nGINGER Want some company? \nTed can barely nod. She unzips the back of her dress and lets it fall to her feet.  The silhouette of her nude body is startlingly gorgeous in the moonlight. Ted watches as she descends, step by step, into the frothy water. \nTed's paralyzed with desire and fear. Ginger descends deeper. A wash of foam caresses her breasts.  She continues.  Until she's completely submerged. \nTed looks startled.  The \"Jaws\" theme echoes through his ears.  He starts to rise. Concerned. When suddenly, he feels something.  Whoa! His swimming trunks land next to him. \nHe starts to rise out of the Jacuzzi, when suddenly he's sucked under.  He thrashes.  His hand grabs the edge of the Jacuzzi. But his fingers give out.  And he slides under. Only to rise out of the water with Ginger. Attached to his lips. Kissing him passionately. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. \"HEAVEN\" MANSION - TED'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nTed and Ginger in bed.  Morning rays, satin sheets, what a night.  Ted awakens.  He stares at Ginger in awe, remembering what happened. Smiles big. \nTed slides out of bed.  Catches his reflection in the mirror. Takes a good look at himself. \nTED (posing; cool) Who's your daddy? \nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY \nPress Conference. Lights, cameras, reporters, bedlam. Uncle Billy, Helen, and Ted sit at a makeshift dais. \nUNCLE BILLY ...My brilliant, extraordinary nephew, Ted Nelson, has brought enough fresh blood to this company to make all of Transylvania happy for the next fifty or sixty years. I'll give him the mike now and you'll see what I mean. This apple didn't fall far from the tree. \nTed prepares to speak. A little nervous from the spotlights, but hell, he's a man now. Uncle Billy gives him a reassuring look. \nUNCLE BILLY (CONT'D) (whispering) Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications. \nTED I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part. (proud of himself) For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why. \nHe glances at Uncle Billy, who urges him to tell more. \nTED (CONT'D) They tell me I've got my father's taste in women and cars. (winking) The faster, the better. \nCHUCKLES from the crowd. Uncle Billy gives him a \"thumb's up\" sign. \nTED (CONT'D) And I'm really looking forward to the challenge of bringing \"Heaven\" magazine into the 21st century. \nINT. CHRISTY MALONE'S BATHROOM - SAME \nIn the middle of waxing her bikini line, Christy jumps up and down excitedly. \nCHRISTY He asked me to the prom! ME! We're practically engaged! \nINT. JULIE CONROY'S BEDROOM - SAME \nJulie watches TV. Stunned. \nJULIE He reinvented himself into a dick. \nINT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S DEN - SAME \nPrincipal Merkin watches TV. Simmering. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN You don't even have your high school diploma yet, Mr. Nelson. I'm still the boss of you. \nINT. NELSON FAMILY ROOM - SAME \nTed's parents and little Jimmy stare in amazement at their old-fashioned console RCA.  A geeky high school picture of Ted appears on screen, as a REPORTER babbles... \nBABBLING REPORTER (ON TV) The big question now remains: Will success spoil Ted Nelson, the straight-A journalism student from Xenia, Ohio, whose life was transformed overnight when he found out he was rich, powerful, and certainly the most eligible bachelor in the entire nation? \nMOM (shocked) Our Teddy inherited \"Heaven?\" \nDAD He said he was set for book money. \nJimmy turns to his parents. \nJIMMY Mom, Dad. Forget about roller blades for my birthday. I'd prefer a DNA test. Can you prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am not, for example, a Guccione? \nThe door bell CHIMES. Mom and Dad look at each other. This can't be good. \n", "test2_true": "DELIVERYMAN Delivery for Jimmy Nelson. \nEXT. NELSON HOUSE - DAY \nJimmy squeezes past Dad and jumps on the bike as Mom appears in the doorway. \nMOM My goodness, who sent this? \nDELIVERY MAN It's from \"Heaven,\" ma'am. \nDAD Ted. Of course. \nJIMMY (riding around) I love you, Ted! \nMOM We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear? \nDAD Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but... \nAt that moment, ANOTHER DELIVERY MAN and his HELPER unload a large crate from another truck. They approach Dad and Mom. \nDELIVERY MAN #2 Delivery for Robert Nelson. \nDAD For me? What is it? \nDELIVERY MAN #2 Appears to be tools, sir. \nMOM Oh, no. Ted's gone completely overboard. \nDad approaches the crate as the Delivery Man opens it to reveal a large scarlet and gray case of tools.  Dad opens one of the drawers.  Runs his fingers over the shiny instruments. Tears in his eyes. \nMOM (CONT'D) Sweetheart, what is it? \nDAD I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors. \nMOM Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance. \nAnother delivery truck arrives.  Then the local news vans. Neighbors rush out of their houses. The phone RINGS.  Mom dashes inside. \nINT. THE NELSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nMom grabs the phone. \nMOM Teddy? Is that you? \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. \"HEAVEN\" MANSION - TED'S ROOM - DAY \nTed wears a cordless headset phone, as if he was born with it. As he talks, he flexes his muscles in front of a full length mirror. \nTED Well? Surprised? \nMOM What is all this? When are you coming home? \nTED Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry. \nMOM Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive. \nTED Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from. \nMom looks up as ANOTHER DELIVERY MAN wheels a washing machine and dryer into the house. \nDELIVERY MAN #3 Where do you want them, lady? \nMom's eyes light up. \nMOM Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes? \nTED Only the best for my mother. \nMOM (softening) You promise you'll finish school? \nTED I'll make you very proud. \nEXT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING \n", "test2_id": 1231, "test3_input": "TED That was code for \"I like you.\" \nChristy giggles. \nCHRISTY Wanna unzip me? \nTed slowly unzips Christy's top, catching a glimpse of her long, sensuous back. She resumes posing. Flashing a bare shoulder.  A coy look. She doesn't need direction. She's a natural. \nCHRISTY (CONT'D) Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess. \nTED I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence. \nCHRISTY Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself. \nChristy slips off her cheerleader top. Lowers her skirt. Flings it aside. She's wearing only panties the size of a Band-aid. Ted is mute. Staring at her perfect body. \nCHRISTY (CONT'D) Well? \nTED You have changed since second grade. \nCHRISTY I mean, what do you think? \nTED You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain. \nCHRISTY Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny. \nTed steps out of the shower.  Out of Christy's sight, he squirms in his jeans. Trying to hide his enthusiasm. \nMUSIC suddenly seems to come from nowhere. Nine Inch Nails. \"I Want to Fuck You Like An Animal.\" \nTED (sotto) God help me. \nTed steps back into the shower.  Christy rubs an ice cube on her left nipple. \nCHRISTY I heard they do this on photo shoots.  Wanna to do the other one? \nShe tosses him the ice cube. He fumbles. It lands on the floor. \nTED You're doing just fine, Christy. Believe me. \nCHRITY Then I'm ready when you are. \nTed looks through the lens. We can see him trembling.  Music blasts as Ted's camera burns through film.  They're both getting into it.  Water pulsating over her body. Steam rising.  Christy begins lathering her breasts. \nCHRISTY I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you. \nTED Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse. \nCHRISTY Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces. (she smiles, sexily) Are you hungry? \nIs he hungry. He's been working up this appetite for ten years. He can barely contain himself. \nTED God, you are so hot. \nCHRISTY Then you better get in the water, before you get burned. \nTed calls her bluff. He sets aside his camera. Walks right into the water. Through the steam.  Toward Christy. She wraps a leg around him, sucking face, wanting more. \nCHRISTY (CONT'D) You and me, finally. This will be so fantastic, Teddy Bear. Trust me. \nSuddenly Ted stops. Remembering what Julie said about trust. \nTED I'm sorry, Christy. I've been crazy about you forever, and this is definitely a page right out of my palm pilot, but I just can't go through with it. \nHe turns away, but Christy presses her bare body against his back.  Wrapping her hands around his waist. Caressing his chest, his stomach... \nCHRISTY Sure you can. You're only human. It's not like you're made of steel. (she lowers her hand) Or ARE you? \nSMASH CUT TO: \nTed and Christy locked in a steamy embrace. Rolling on the floor. Hands, arms, lips, tongues, all in motion. As the shower drenches them. \nSuddenly, they roll into a pair of legs.  Both look up.  The steam clears to reveal Julie. Arms crossed. Hurt, but not surprised. \nJULIE What's up, doc? \n", "test3_true": "TED Wait, Julie, wait! \nINT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nJulie dashes out of the girls' locker room, passing a JANITOR.  Ted follows, dripping water. \nJANITOR I'm sorry, Mr. Ted. She pushed right past me. \nTED (calling after Julie) At least let me explain! \nJulie darts into the girls' restroom.  Ted stops at the door. Then realizes there is no one else around.  He heads inside. \nINT. GIRLS' RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJulie's too proud to let him see her cry. But we can tell she's upset. \nJULIE Go away, Ted. Just go. \nTed corners her near a row of sinks. \nTED Please believe me. It was just a kiss for old time's sake. I've had a stupid crush on her since I was seven, but I never got closer to her than four feet and then there she was right in front of me, completely naked. \nJulie looks at him, pensively. She unzips the back of her summery dress. And lets it fall to the floor. She's completely naked and absolutely gorgeous. \nTed gasps. He's been around dozens of naked women by now, but this one he can't just gawk at. This one he really cares about. \nJULIE Being naked is no big deal. It has nothing to do with emotion, nothing to do with love. You can be around all the naked girls you want and you won't be even one step closer to anything meaningful in your life. \nShe puts on her dress, gracefully. As if nothing happened. \nJULIE (CONT'D) See that? You don't know me even one ounce better than you did before. You and your stupid magazine. I liked you better when you were sweet and kind and human, like the rest of us. \nAt that moment, Ted's cell phone rings. Julie walks away, leaving Ted completely alone. He answers, lifelessly... \nTED Yes? \nUNCLE BILLY (O.S.) We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk. \nINT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY \nTed walks down the hallway.  Three JOCKS look through the new issue of \"Heaven.\" Laughing.  They taunt Ted. \nJOCK #1 You got a great sense of humor. I love the three hundred pound Eskimo chick. \nJOCK #2 You like Eskimo pie, Teddy? \nJOCK #3 I like the African chick with the big lip. You could stash a lot of weed in there. Maybe even a six pack. \nTed's mortified, depressed. Charlie appears next to him with \"Heaven\" in hand. \nCHARLIE Holy stinkers, what were you thinking? \nTED We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world. \nCHARLIE Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold. \nPrincipal Merkin approaches. Also holding \"Heaven\" in his hand. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN Ted, I realize I owe you an apology. You're destroying \"Heaven\" much faster from the inside than I ever could from the outside. Good job, son. \nTed could not feel worse. \nINT. \"HEAVEN\" MANSION - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nTed, Uncle Billy, and Helen. Meeting with the HEADS OF VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS. \nHEAD OF MARKETING Our advertisers are wigging out. Half of them are threatening to pull their ads for next month. The other half already did. \nUNCLE BILLY It was nothing more than beginner's folly. Tell everyone to lighten up. \nHELEN It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again. (the words pain her) Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation. \nTED Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal. \nHEAD OF FINANCE Another disaster like this could sink us. We've got thousands of subscribers requesting refunds. \n", "test3_id": 1232}

{"train": "WHO'S YOUR DADDY \nWritten by \nMaria Veltre & Jack Sekowski \nFADE IN: \nEXT. ABOVE THE CLOUDS - DAY \nWe fly high above heavenly clouds.  Beneath a brilliant blue sky.  A TEENAGED BOY'S VOICE greets us... \nTED NELSON (V.O.) On any given day, your life can change in the blink of an eye. It's a clich\u00e9, I know... \nDescending through the clouds, we are caught for a moment in a dreamy gauze.  We emerge to find ourselves gliding above a small town.  Descending lower.  And lower.  To Xenia, Ohio. \nTED (V.O.) ...But a lot of clich\u00e9s get to be clich\u00e9s because they're true. Your life CAN change in the blink of an eye.  What I mean is, one day you're a regular chump, a wannabe something.  You're not even totally sure WHAT you wannabe... \nWe pass over the town square. A fine spring day in middle America. Red brick buildings with names like \"Miller & Son Drugs,\" \"Two Sisters Gifts,\" \"Nelson Family Market.\"   You can almost smell the rosy cheeks and moral fiber. \nTED (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...The next day the doorbell rings and some stranger's holding your ticket to being SOMEBODY. \nStill flying over the town, we focus on a TEENAGED BOY on a Schwinn.  We follow as he pedals his way to... \nTECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL \nA three story building.  Older, brick, sturdy.  Meticulously maintained. \nTED (V.O.) It happens every day.  Dreams come true.  And not just for those dim witted chain-smoking hillbillies you see on TV.  You know, the ones who win the Super Lotto and spend their fortune on a truck full of Goobers and a new set of front teeth.  It could happen to any guy, any time...even ME. \nEXT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nA JANITOR raises the American flag.  It flaps proudly as the teenager chains his bike to a bike rack. He glances up at the flag, which is reflected in his uber-hip sunglasses.  When he smiles, in SLOW MO, his teeth seem to sparkle. \nTED (V.O.) Uh, that's not me.  I'm over here. \nWe SWISH PAN to another teenager, locking his bike.  Meet our much less glamorous hero:  TED NELSON, 17.  A decent looking kid.  Not hip enough to be cool.  Not square enough to be tormented. He joins the other KIDS heading into the school. \nTED (V.O.) (CONT'D) You're disappointed, I know. I admit, I was hopeless back then. The 'do, the shades, ugh. But I always had good taste in women. \nINT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY \nCHRISTY MALONE, 17, fills her cheerleader uniform in all the right places. We watch her at her locker. Also in SLOW MO. Which makes even her most mundane task seem graceful. Wow, just look at her stack those books. \nTED (V.O.) That's Christy Malone.  Head cheerleader, love of my life, lust of my loins. \nChristy glances off screen and SQUEALS excitedly.  Another cheerleader enters the frame, holding a newspaper called \"EXPOSED!\"  Christy reads the headline. \nCHRISTY \"Health Teacher Flunks Her Own Lesson!\"  No WAY!  It's Miss Pratt, smoking a doobie! \nChristy calls to Ted.... \nCHRISTY (CONT'D) Look at this, Ted! Imagine if we did THIS in the school paper! \nShe shows him \"Exposed!\" Ted gawks. Happy just to be this close to Christy. But they are quickly interrupted by... \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN (O.S.) Hand them over! Immediately! \nPRINCIPAL RICHARD MERKIN, mid-50's, marches down the hallway, seizing copies of \"EXPOSED!\" from students' hands. We can see that it is a \"homemade\" looking newspaper. And there's obviously much ado about it.  Christy winks at Ted as she hides the newspaper in her locker. \nFREEZE FRAME ON Christy, WINKING. \nTED (V.O.) Look at that smile.  That wink. That's no platonic wink. That's a wink that says, \"I don't just want you, Ted. I NEED you.\" So of course I had to ask her to the prom. I mean, she was practically begging for it. \nINT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - NEWSROOM - DAY \nTed ambles toward Christy. Struggling for nonchalance.  She limbers up by stretching her leg high against the wall. She whispers to another CHEERLEADER.  They giggle.  Then Christy turns to Ted.  Flashing that perfect smile of hers. \nCHRISTY Just the guy I've been looking for. \nTed wipes his sweaty palms on his jeans... \nTED I've been looking for you, too. \nChristy continues stretching.  Driving Ted crazy with her contortionist moves. \nTED I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe. \nCHARLIE That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again. \nChristy catches Ted's eye and smiles a perfect smile. \nTED See? Did you see that? \nCHARLIE She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas. \nCharlie secretly shows Ted a nudie magazine. \"HEAVEN.\" A GORGEOUS WOMAN with perfect breasts graces the cover. A golden halo over her head.  Charlie flips it open.  Points to a picture. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April. (feminine voice) \"Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex.\" Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube. (winking at Ted) Don't knock it till you tried it. \nTED Were you always this sick? \nCHARLIE One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked. \nTed takes a peek at Ginger.  Then at Christy. \nTED Someday, I'll find out. \nCHARLIE You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip. \nTed grabs the magazine and flips through more pages. Beautiful, naked women.  Palm trees. Blue skies. Bubbling Jacuzzis. Red Ferraris. The stuff that fantasies are made of. Ted looks determined... \nTED I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents. \nCHARLIE That's crazy talk. \nTED I defy any and all limits. \nCharlie can see the look in Ted's eyes.  He's about to do something bold and daring. Something he'll regret. \nCHARLIE Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it. \nTED (walking away; defiantly) Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself. \nTed starts to walk across the corridor, ignoring Charlie... \nCHARLIE I'm warning you. This is an official warning. Danger, Will Robinson, danger. \nA quietly attractive teenaged girl, JULIE CONROY, watches Ted. She seems concerned, too. \nTED (V.O.) There's one more person you should meet. Someone integral to my story. \nFREEZE FRAME ON JULIE. \nTED (V.O.) That's Julie Conroy. Unlike the rest of these losers, she didn't grow up in Xenia, Ohio. I just met her that day. But already, she had made a difference in my life. \nINT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY \nTeachers mill around.  Chatting. Snacking on donuts, coffee. PRINCIPAL MERKIN bursts in, spilling a stack of \"EXPOSED!\" onto a table. Everyone freezes. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN Oh, Miss Pratt, Miss Pratt! What were you thinking?  How could you be so careless? (reading) \"Exposing Hypocrisy in the Morons who Teach Us.\" That's the little bastard's motto! \nThe teachers turn to MISS PRATT.  We recognize her from the cover of \"EXPOSED!\" \nMISS PRATT (summoning courage) Principal Merkin, I realize we have to teach the children that recreational drugs are the devil's work, but that doesn't mean we don't dance with the Prince of Darkness ourselves, every now and again. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN Ah, well, bravo!  That's just what we'll tell the school board. \nSuddenly, an AIR VENT pops open and CRASHES on top of a coffee machine.  THE WHOLE ROOM, IN SHOCKED SILENCE, turns to look at... \nJULIE, her head framed by the air duct.  She holds a digital camera in her hand. Her expression says: \"Oh, shit.\" \nPrincipal Merkin narrows his eyes at the \"little bastard\" who has been making his life hell. \nINT. TED'S OFFICE - NEWSROOM - DAY \nJulie sits in a chair in front of Ted's desk. She and Ted size up one another. \nTED (V.O.) Merk's punishment was cruel. Expulsion without appeal. Or working for me on the school paper. The school paper would be torture for a gonzo reporter like Julie and we both knew it. But what choice did she have? \nJulie leans back on the chair, rests her feet on Ted's files, and blows a huge bubble. \nJULIE I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds. \nTED But you triple-dog-dared me. \nJULIE It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way. \nCHARLIE One word, my friend. One word. MEATLOAF. \nTed lifts his head.  Looks in the mirror.  Distraught. \nTED There's gotta be more to life than meatloaf. \nINT. THE NELSON KITCHEN - EVENING \nNot a hair above middle class. Home sweet home nonetheless. Dinner in progress. MOM, DAD, Ted, younger brother, JIMMY. A mutt named CORKY curled under the table. A storm brews. Lightning in the distance. Thunder RUMBLES. \nTed's Mom observes her son with unmistakable Mom-radar. She slides a slab of - rotten timing! - MEAT LOAF onto his plate with an unpleasant thud. Ted shudders... \nTED If I never eat another bite of meat loaf again, it'll be too soon. \nTed's Mom frowns. Jimmy explains matter-of-factly. \nJIMMY Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed. \nTED Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store! \nTed's parents look at one another, shake their heads. His Dad gently explains... \nDAD We heard about Christy, son. \nJimmy tries to stifle a grin. \nTED What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day? \nMOM No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you. \nTED I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town! \nDAD We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous... (catches himself) We...uh...we understand your disappointment. \nTED It's my private business! Mine! \nMOM Can the tantrum, sweet pea. We're the good guys, remember? \nJIMMY Mom, Dad. Don't allow this disturbing behavior to furrow your collective brow. Ted's just experiencing some post-adolescent turmoil, coming to terms with the whole \"small town dynamic.\" \nTED I hate Xenia! I hate my life! \nTed charges for the front door... \nTED (V.O.) (CONT'D) And until that moment, this was the worst day of my seventeen and a half years. And then it happened. Three, two, one... \nEXT. NELSON HOUSE - EVENING \nTed bursts outside and plows straight into MARTY ZUKERMAN, a short, rotund man in his mid-50s. \nTED Whoa! Sorry, mister. \nZukerman's briefcase and papers are knocked to the ground. Ted helps to retrieve them. \nZUKERMAN In a hurry, are we? \nTED I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling? \nZUKERMAN Bad news. \nTED People pay good money for that? \nZUKERMAN I'm just a messenger. \nTed starts to back away. Instinctively knowing the bad news must be for him. \nTED Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day. \nZUKERMAN It's about your parents. \nDAD Son. \nTED Well, why should I? \nDAD They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby. \nTED I guess. \nDAD They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy. \nTED Yeah. \nDAD Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be? \nTED I guess we could go to Disneyland or something. \nDAD Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood. \nTED Like one of those \"National Geographic\" specials with the topless chicks? \nDAD Whatever helps you cope. \nTED I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face. \nDAD There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach... \nTED ...not the pit. \nTed's Dad hugs him briefly, laughing... \nDAD Always one step ahead of your dear old dad. \nEXT. LAX - DAY \nA 747 lands screaming on the runway. \nINT. LAX - DAY \nTed and Charlie exit the plane. They walk tentatively through the sleeve towards the entry gate. \nCHARLIE I wonder if this is what it feels like to be born? \nTed gives him a look. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism. \nTED Poor Freud, turning in his grave. \nCHARLIE Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation. \nTED Nobody knows about your mental retardation. \nCHARLIE Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation. \nTED Nobody knows about your constant masturbation. \nCHARLIE And nobody knows you're a virgin! (after a beat) Aw, who are we kidding... \nCharlie's words echo loudly through the sleeve... \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) ...EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE A VIRGIN! \nPeople stare at Ted as they pass. \nTED I think I'll reinvent a new best friend. \nINT. LAX - TERMINAL - DAY \nTed and Charlie enter the terminal.  Friends and family wait for loved ones.  A few chauffeurs hold signs with names.  One stands out.  Tall. Blonde. Gorgeous. In a short skirt. A matching low cut jacket.  And a cap.  She's stunning.  And she's holding a sign that reads: TED NELSON. \nCHARLIE What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight? \nTED Astronomical. \nThey grin at one another. Then approach the Chauffeur. \nCHARLIE I'm Charles. The handsome, devoted best friend. We're so close, we feel each other's pain. \nThe voluptuous beauty notices Charlie's soaked crotch. He winks... \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) See what you do to me, baby. \nJust then, the spry HELEN McDOLE, 60s, emerges from the mansion.  She approaches Ted and hugs him. \nHELEN Oh my, he would have been so proud. You're the spitting image of him. \nCHARLIE He never spits, ma'am. Ever. He can't even get a good hocker going. I've tried to teach him. It comes from the diaphragm. \nTED (sharply; to Charlie) You're on the next plane home. \nHELEN (emotional embrace) I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary. \nINT. \"HEAVEN\" MANSION - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nTed takes a seat at the spacious conference table.  Helen sits on his right. Charlie sits on his left. \nZukerman and two other IMPATIENT ATTORNEYS wait at the head of the table.  Finally Zukerman checks his watch and rises. \nZUKERMAN We're running out of time. The kid's here. We don't need HIM. \nHELEN Perhaps we could be patient for just a moment or two longer? \nThey all watch a WALL CLOCK. Seconds pass, slowly, slowly. Then suddenly Zukerman rises. \nZUKERMAN What did the doctor say to the nurse as they watched something black and white and red in a blender? (a wry smile) No more patients. \nVery dramatically, Zukerman slides a copy of \"Heaven\" magazine down the conference table. Right to Ted. \nZUKERMAN (CONT'D) Are you familiar with \"Heaven?\" \nTED I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand. \nZUKERMAN Your fathered owned the entire \"Heaven\" empire.  You own it now. Any questions? \nTed's stunned, speechless. Charlie gawks. \nCHARLIE Everything?  The publishing division, the real estate holdings, the retail outlets, the theme parks? \nZUKERMAN As far as the eye can see. \nZukerman presses a remote control.  A wall panel slides open to reveal a large monitor which springs to life.  On the screen is a striking couple.  Ted'S BIOLOGICAL PARENTS. HEATHER and TOM DEEDS. Heather, stunningly sexy and overflowing from her gold sequined halter top. Tom, very handsome in a Vegas showman sort of way. \nHEATHER Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you! \nTOM But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust. \nHEATHER But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now. \nTOM If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right? \nTed looks guilty. This is too weird. \nHEATHER But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad. \nTOM We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this. \nHeather holds up the first issue of \"Heaven.\" She's on the cover, wearing nothing but a halo. She looks almost exactly the same today, with a few extra nips and tucks. \nHEATHER Can you believe that was me? \nTOM Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history. \nHEATHER So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything. \nTOM Everything. \nHeather leans forward and blows a kiss into the camera. Her strongest assets spilling forward. \nHEATHER We love you, Ted. We always did. We always will. \nCharlie's practically slobbering. He elbows Ted. \nUNCLE BILLY Hello, girls! Have you met Ted? \nThe women wave, ad-libbing warm greetings. Charlie leans towards Ted, confiding... \nCHARLIE This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro. \nTED Be cool. Fake it if you have to. \nUNCLE BILLY Good advice, Ted. You have your father's instincts. \n\"His father.\" The words sound so strange. He never even met the guy. \nUNCLE BILLY (CONT'D) Just remember, you're not the man you were a day ago. And these girls, let's just say they'd be eager to please you. \nTed gulps. It's hard to believe this is real. \nCHARLIE I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight? \nTED This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies. \nCHARLIE Oh. Well. Maybe not yet. \nTED Not ever. Never. \nUNCLE BILLY Never say never. \nCHARLIE Oh, god.  Look. Look. \nTed looks.  A beautiful woman sensuously rubs tanning lotion over her OWN breasts.  The boys stare, riveted. \nCHARLIE (CONT'D) I really love your peaches, wanna shake your tree. \nUncle Billy grins. \nUNCLE BILLY Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman. \nTED (voice cracking) I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own. \nCHARLIE (having a moment) Oh baby, yes, yes, yes. Fuck me like you mean it. \nTed elbows Charlie out of his fantasy. \nTED You kiss your mother with that mouth? \nCHARLIE I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know... \nHe means dead. \nTED So far away? In Xenia? \nCHARLIE Yeah, whatever. \nINT.  THE NELSON HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMom waits nervously for the phone to ring. \nMOM Teddy? Is that you? \nDad hurries out of the bathroom, hiking up his pajamas. Mom speaks loudly, as if Ted's in Siberia. \nMOM (CONT'D) How are you, baby? Are you all right? \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. TED'S BEDROOM - \"HEAVEN\" MANSION - NIGHT \nA palatial suite. Very Louis XIV.  Ted throws a sheet over a nude sculpture of his biological mother. While holding a cordless phone in the crook of his neck. \nTED I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know. \nMOM Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you? \nTED Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin. \nMOM Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill. \nTED Oh, how inappropriate is that! \nCHARLIE Take a whiff of heaven. \nTED How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties? \nCHARLIE I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother-- \nTED Give me those! \nTed grabs the panties just as Charlie pulls away, ripping them in half. Just then the door opens to reveal a very proper ENGLISH BUTLER. \nBUTLER I do apologize, sir. I heard a noise. \nTed and Charlie awkwardly hide the panty halves behind their backs. \nTED We were just-- \nBUTLER --I completely understand, sir. I'll leave you to your business. Good night. \nThe Butler leaves.  Ted glares at Charlie. Who shrugs. \nCHARLIE A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen. \nTED (sarcastic) Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies. \nINT. \"HEAVEN\" MANSION - GARAGE - THE NEXT MORNING \nThe garage is crowded with two dozen sporty classics. Ted runs his hands over the hood of a red Ferrari 575M Maranello. He pulls the door open and slides into the leather seat. \nGINGER (O.S.) Wanna take me for a ride? \nTed turns around and spots Ginger, the goddess from the pool, making her way towards him.  He gulps. \nTED I-I don't have the keys. \nGINGER They're in the ignition, silly. \nTed glances down. There they are. She hops in next to him. He doesn't know what to do. \nGINGER (CONT'D) You do know how to drive? \nTED I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick. \nGINGER Want a lesson? \nTed blushes. He needs a lot of lessons. \nGINGER (CONT'D) Press your left foot on the clutch. And turn the key. \nThe Ferrari growls to life. Ginger places her hand over Ted's. \nGINGER (CONT'D) Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear. \nTED Got it. \nGinger moves her slender fingers on his knees. Showing him how it's done. \nGINGER Now very carefully apply some pressure to the gas pedal with your right foot as you release the clutch with your left. \nShe squeezes his thigh and winks. \nEXT. \"HEAVEN\" MANSION - GARAGE - DAY \nThe Ferrari jerks out of the garage and promptly stalls. Ginger giggles.  Could Ted be MORE embarrassed? \nGINGER The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again. \nTED I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car. \nGINGER It's your car. These are all your cars. \nTED Some of them have to be automatics. \nGINGER Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. \"Like a woman, purring with ecstasy.\" \nThe Masseuses help Uncle Billy out of the Jacuzzi. They say their goodnights and Ted closes his eyes. When he opens them, Ginger stands at the edge of the tub. \nGINGER Want some company? \nTed can barely nod. She unzips the back of her dress and lets it fall to her feet.  The silhouette of her nude body is startlingly gorgeous in the moonlight. Ted watches as she descends, step by step, into the frothy water. \nTed's paralyzed with desire and fear. Ginger descends deeper. A wash of foam caresses her breasts.  She continues.  Until she's completely submerged. \nTed looks startled.  The \"Jaws\" theme echoes through his ears.  He starts to rise. Concerned. When suddenly, he feels something.  Whoa! His swimming trunks land next to him. \nHe starts to rise out of the Jacuzzi, when suddenly he's sucked under.  He thrashes.  His hand grabs the edge of the Jacuzzi. But his fingers give out.  And he slides under. Only to rise out of the water with Ginger. Attached to his lips. Kissing him passionately. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. \"HEAVEN\" MANSION - TED'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nTed and Ginger in bed.  Morning rays, satin sheets, what a night.  Ted awakens.  He stares at Ginger in awe, remembering what happened. Smiles big. \nTed slides out of bed.  Catches his reflection in the mirror. Takes a good look at himself. \nTED (posing; cool) Who's your daddy? \nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY \nPress Conference. Lights, cameras, reporters, bedlam. Uncle Billy, Helen, and Ted sit at a makeshift dais. \nUNCLE BILLY ...My brilliant, extraordinary nephew, Ted Nelson, has brought enough fresh blood to this company to make all of Transylvania happy for the next fifty or sixty years. I'll give him the mike now and you'll see what I mean. This apple didn't fall far from the tree. \nTed prepares to speak. A little nervous from the spotlights, but hell, he's a man now. Uncle Billy gives him a reassuring look. \nUNCLE BILLY (CONT'D) (whispering) Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications. \nTED I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part. (proud of himself) For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why. \nHe glances at Uncle Billy, who urges him to tell more. \nTED (CONT'D) They tell me I've got my father's taste in women and cars. (winking) The faster, the better. \nCHUCKLES from the crowd. Uncle Billy gives him a \"thumb's up\" sign. \nTED (CONT'D) And I'm really looking forward to the challenge of bringing \"Heaven\" magazine into the 21st century. \nINT. CHRISTY MALONE'S BATHROOM - SAME \nIn the middle of waxing her bikini line, Christy jumps up and down excitedly. \nCHRISTY He asked me to the prom! ME! We're practically engaged! \nINT. JULIE CONROY'S BEDROOM - SAME \nJulie watches TV. Stunned. \nJULIE He reinvented himself into a dick. \nINT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S DEN - SAME \nPrincipal Merkin watches TV. Simmering. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN You don't even have your high school diploma yet, Mr. Nelson. I'm still the boss of you. \nINT. NELSON FAMILY ROOM - SAME \nTed's parents and little Jimmy stare in amazement at their old-fashioned console RCA.  A geeky high school picture of Ted appears on screen, as a REPORTER babbles... \nBABBLING REPORTER (ON TV) The big question now remains: Will success spoil Ted Nelson, the straight-A journalism student from Xenia, Ohio, whose life was transformed overnight when he found out he was rich, powerful, and certainly the most eligible bachelor in the entire nation? \nMOM (shocked) Our Teddy inherited \"Heaven?\" \nDAD He said he was set for book money. \nJimmy turns to his parents. \nJIMMY Mom, Dad. Forget about roller blades for my birthday. I'd prefer a DNA test. Can you prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am not, for example, a Guccione? \nThe door bell CHIMES. Mom and Dad look at each other. This can't be good. \nA beautiful spring morning.  Cars pull into the school parking lot.  Students mingle in small groups. Making their way into the building.  A group of GUYS look up. \nSuddenly, a helicopter swooshes through the air, circling the school as if to get everyone's attention, then landing on a grassy knoll. The helicopter is painted heavenly blue with a pattern of white billowy clouds. \nThe door slides open and out hops Ted. In SLOW-MO. Looking seriously cool from the tips of his silver toed boots to his stylish Persol shades.  Until he takes a second step and stumbles slightly, catching himself from falling face first into the grass. \nCharlie is right behind him. Looking great, too, but vaguely Mafioso in his efforts to be hip. He turns to the beautiful blonde PILOT and plants a big wet kiss for everyone to see. \nTed and Charlie strut towards the school as Principal Merkin bursts through the front doors, shouting... \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN You cannot land a helicopter in my school yard! Get that blasted thing out of here! \nTed raises his hand.  The chopper rises as if on cue. Without a word, Ted and Charlie pass the ruffled Principal Merkin and strut toward the entrance. Classmates surround Ted.  Congratulating him.  Everyone wanting to be Ted's new best friend.  Julie walks up to Charlie. \nJULIE What gives, Don Corleone? \nCHARLIE (smug) We reinvented ourselves. \nJULIE New Hushpuppies don't make a new man. \nCHARLIE You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers. \nJULIE That explains the emptiness that haunts me. \nCHARLIE Jealousy is so unattractive. \nTed makes eye contact with Julie. Winking like he's Don Juan. She just stares at him, blankly. \nJULIE Second only to unfettered arrogance and the inability to see the irony therein. \nCharlie's baffled by that one. \nCHARLIE Wanna see my hickey from Miss December? \nJulie groans. \nINT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S OFFICE - DAY \nPrincipal Merkin paces dramatically... \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich. \nTED Thanks, Principal Merkin. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN I'll be blunt. I know you can take it. \nTED Yes, sir. I'll brace myself. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you. \nTED You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire? \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN That's a good start, yes. A very good start. \nTED Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN I never figured you for a pimp. \nTED Have you ever even looked at \"Heaven?\" \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing. \nTED I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then? \nPrincipal Merkin opens his desk drawer sheepishly. Caresses the watch. It kills him to return it. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN No. No, I won't. Thank you. For reminding me. \nINT. NEWSROOM - DAY \nFlurry of activity. Ted on his cell phone. Julie types furiously. Taking her job very seriously. Christy Malone props one leg against the wall. Demonstrating those contortionist warm-up moves that drove Ted mad with desire. \nCHRISTY Great jacket, Teddy Bear. \nTED (hanging up phone) Yeah? You like? \nMOM Your Dad and I were raised with a certain work ethic, that's all. \nJulie listens closely, admiring Ted's parents. \nDAD We can't start living like we're the Rockerfellers or something. \nJIMMY Mom, Dad. The Rockerfellers are paupers compared to my favorite brother, Ted. \nTED You don't have to work another day in your lives. \nMOM But how would we pay our bills? \nDAD We just barely have enough for your college tuition, son. \nTed's frustration mounts. \nTED Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue. \nMOM Oh. Goodness. \nTED You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do! \nMOM (after a beat) Like what? \nTED Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance. \nDAD But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true. \nTED Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives. \nMOM But who would run the store? \nTED Forget the store. Think big. \nDad looks at Mom. Forget the store. That stings. \nDAD Ted, we put a lot of love in our business. \nMOM We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest. \nDAD We love our lives just the way they are. \nDisappointed, disgusted, Ted looks to Julie for support. Tears fill her eyes. Mom and Dad moved her. Ted shrugs and digs into his food. \nEXT. ABOVE THE CLOUDS - DAY \nA heavenly blue jet with billowy white clouds soars through the sky. \nINT. THE \"HEAVEN\" JET - DAY \nBeyond first class; the ultimate in posh. Charlie sweet-talks a sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT. \nCHARLIE Call me Charlie. I'm a photographer for \"Heaven\" magazine. And a very cunning linguist. \nThe Flight Attendant pulls him toward the washroom, quickly. \nJulie interviews Ted, complete with tape recorder. \nTED I have to admit, I always felt... different. \nJULIE Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps? \nTED I don't get the distinction. \nJULIE Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew? \nTED I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating. \nJULIE I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist. \nTED I guess. \nJULIE Interesting. \nAnother FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches... \nJULIE You've got enough people kissing your ass. \nGinger returns with a rose. \nGINGER Here you go, cutie patootie. Rich guys always wear flowers. \nJulie gives Ted a look. See what I mean. \nINT. THE TONIGHT SHOW SET - DAY \nJay Leno seems charmed.  Ted behaves as if he does this every day. The rose from Ginger is pinned to his lapel. \nJAY How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia? \nTED Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive. \nJAY Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee? \nAudience LAUGHS. \nTED I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols. \nJAY What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in \"Heaven?\" \nTed's so smooth. We know it's still HIM under all that Armani, but it sure does make him LOOK different. \nTED Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of \"beauty.\" \nJAY I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers? \nTED Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, \"The Girls of Xenia.\" Just to show my appreciation. \nOFF IN THE WINGS \nJulie looks thoroughly disgusted. \nJULIE The Girls of Xenia? Jesus. \nBACK TO STAGE \nJAY Now you're talking. What did Andrew Carnegie ever do? Open a couple of libraries? BOR-ING. \nINT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S KITCHEN - MORNING \nA Cocker Spaniel, POOCHIE, sits under a breakfast table, holding a newspaper in his snout. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN (O.S.) Poochie?  Where's my poochie? Where is she? \nMRS. MERKIN, dressed in a bathrobe and curlers, prepares breakfast.  Their beautiful college-aged daughter, JUDY, eats cereal at the table, while flipping through a glamour magazine. Principal Merkin enters. Ready for work. Wife and daughter don't even look up. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D) Is my Poochie in here? \nPrincipal Merkin pretends to look for the dog in the cupboard. This is obviously a daily ritual. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D) Is she in here?  No.  Where on earth could she be? \nHe looks under the table. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D) There's my Poochie!  There's my girl! \nThe dog leaps into his arms.  Principal Merkin grabs the paper as Poochie starts to lick his face. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D) Poochie loves Daddy, doesn't she? \nMRS. MERKIN Breakfast is getting cold. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN Thank you, dear. \nMRS. MERKIN No dogs at the table. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN I know, dear. \nPrincipal Merkin places the dog on the ground, takes a seat, and bites into a breakfast sausage.  He opens the paper and is confronted by a full page ad. \nCLOSE ON NEWSPAPER AD \nJUDY I'm an adult. I can do whatever I want. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN My roof, my rules, young lady. \nHe grabs her arm while knocking the stack of flyers out of Charlie's hands.  As Principal Merkin drags her away, Judy smiles back at Charlie.  He winks. \nCHARLIE Send us a picture, sugar.  We'll get back to you. \nThe stack of flyers FLOATS over the railing and onto the ground floor, just as a group of LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN enters the building lobby. They excitedly reach for the flyers. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN BUILDING - XENIA - DAY \nA line of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - all shapes and sizes - snakes around the block and into a doorway.  The women are dressed to impress, in very skimpy clothing. Ted pulls up in his convertible Ferrari. The women shout greetings as Ted heads for the door. \nINT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - DAY \nWe follow Ted as he dashes up the stairs, along the line of women, towards an office. \nTED (greeting the women) Hello there...Looking great...Very nice. \nCharlie looks frazzled. \nCHARLIE You're late, bro! \nTED Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic. \nCHARLIE You'll never believe who's in there. \nTED It better not be my Aunt Trudy. \nThey enter... \nINT. TED'S OFFICE - DAY \nA YOUNG WOMAN sits with her back to the door. \nTED Sorry to keep you waiting... \nThe woman turns towards Ted, revealing herself to be Christy Malone.  Ted is momentarily stunned. \nCHRISTY Hi, Teddy Bear. \nTED Christy?  You want to be in \"Heaven?\" \nCHRISTY I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible. \nTed doesn't know what to say. Charlie's equally stunned. Hell, it seems, has frozen over. \nTED I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck. \nCHARLIE With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip. \nINT. TED'S BEDROOM - DAY \nHighly modified since the last time we saw it. A large flat screen hangs on the wall.   A high tech computer system for video conferences dominates the room.  Ted speaks with Uncle Billy and Helen. \nUNCLE BILLY So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential. \nTED Really? So I'm doing OK? \nHELEN We're impressed but not surprised, Ted. You have your father's impeccable judgment. \nDad passes the partially open door. Overhearing. He stops. \nTED My father must've been amazing. \nUNCLE BILLY He was in a league of his own. \nSuddenly Ted feels his dad's presence, behind him. \nDAD Sorry I-- \nTED It's okay. You need me? \nDAD (holding a list) Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores. \nTED Whatever you want. \nWE notice Christy Malone dancing with her FOOTBALL CAPTAIN DATE. The perfect male specimen. Christy gives Ted a disappointed, longing gaze. But he's oblivious. \nGINGER I bet St. Tropez in July would be paradise. For a honeymoon. \nSuddenly a FLASH blinds them. It's Julie Conroy, doing her job.  Following her subject. \nGINGER (CONT'D) (snapping) You could have warned us. \nJULIE Oops, sorry. Warning: You've got lipstick on your teeth. \nJulie flashes the camera again. Capturing Ginger's panicked expression. We notice that Julie looks alluring in a deep purple strapless gown. Not so glamorous as Ginger, but far more appealing and natural. \nTED Wow...you clean up nice. \nJULIE Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in. \nGinger seems testy and jealous. Her true colors emerging. \nGINGER Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here. \nTED Of course we were. \nSuddenly the music dies.  Everyone turns to the stage where Principal Merkin stands proudly. Holding a power cord. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN I apologize for interrupting the festivities, but I have some good news. I've been reviewing the rules and regulations set forth by the superintendent of schools. And it seems quite clear... (reading from manual) \"Minors may not be accompanied to school functions by adults unless they are their parents or legal guardians.\" \nA spotlight suddenly finds Ted and Charlie's beautiful dates. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D) So long, ladies. Prom's over. \nThe crowd boos, hisses. \nTED Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN Rules are rules. \nTED Come on, it's our only senior prom. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power. \nCharlie steps in like a hostage negotiator. \nCHARLIE Here's the deal, Merk.  Forget the \"rules and regulations\" malarkey and we'll give you seven minutes in heaven with the Taylor Triplets. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN Out! Now! \nTed realizes his high school reputation is at stake. He steps up on stage. Approaches Principal Merkin. Takes out his wallet. \nTED What's your price, Merk? How much will it cost to make you go bye bye? \nThe crowd CHEERS. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson. \nTED A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin? \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN I'm warning you. \nTED A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything. \nPrincipal Merkin trembles from the sheer temptation of it. Yet he could never succumb in front of so many witnesses. He has to maintain his dignity... \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN That's it! You're out of here! \nFrom nowhere, a flock of beefy SECURITY GUARDS emerge to remove Ted & Co. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D) Good-bye, Mr. Nelson.  Have a pleasant evening. \nThe Marilyn Manson clone is rapidly whisked away, and replaced by six GEEZERS in powder blue tuxedoes. \nAs Security Guards carry them away... \nGINGER Ted! Do something! \nEXT. HOLIDAY INN - NIGHT \nDrunken teenagers pour out of the building.  Dashing for their cars and limos.  Ted's among them.  Suddenly he's cut off by a Harley that stops right in front of him.  It's Julie.  Still in her purple strapless prom dress. With a black motorcycle jacket over it. \nJULIE Need a lift? \nTed jumps on, wrapping his arms around her waist. Julie takes off. \nEXT. STREETS OF XENIA - CONTINUOUS \nJulie maneuvers the nighttime streets of Xenia, taking off \ndown a country road. \nTED (V.O.) Where are we going? \nJULIE (V.O.) To the best hiding place in the world. \nEXT. JULIE'S BACKYARD - NIGHT \nNow we understand. Julie's family comes from major bucks. The yard is massive. And resting in a sprawling oak tree is the best hiding place in the world. \nINT. JULIE'S TREE HOUSE - NIGHT \nA cozy oasis. Books everywhere.  A whole series of flashlights hang upside down like lanterns. Giving the tree house a warm glow. \nTED I can't believe your dad built this for you. \nJULIE He didn't. He had it built. \nTED Whatever. \nJULIE Not \"whatever.\"  It's two different things. \nTED He cared enough to want you to have it. \nJULIE He phoned it in. \nTED I see. \nJULIE I doubt it. \nTED Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl. \nJULIE The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted. \nTED You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball? \nJULIE Your dad taught you everything. \nTED I mean my father. \nJULIE A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad. \nTED It's all so complicated. \nJULIE It's incredibly simple. \nTED I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction. \nJULIE Eventually you'll let go. \nTED And then what? \nJULIE Then you'll see who's really holding on to you. \nTED You're amazing. \nJULIE I know. \nTED Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you. \nJULIE But you never do. \nTED If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything. \nTED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT \nTed hangs up the phone.  Looks around.  Jimmy's gone. But his SHINY NEW BIKE is left behind. \nINT. CINCINNATI NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT \nNot much of a place. A middle-aged TORCH SINGER croons \"MY ROMANCE.\"  Ted and Julie find their way to corner table. Keeping an eye out for Principal Merkin. \nTED I don't know. This place seems pretty tame. \nJULIE You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood? \nTED At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue. \nJULIE Amen to that. \nTheir heads are very close together. A conspiratorial t\u00eate-\u00e0 t\u00eate. \nTED Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart. \nJULIE I'm trembling with excitement. \nTED That has more to do with your proximity to me. \nJULIE (playing along) My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh. \nTED I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that. \nJULIE I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy. \nTED Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing. \nJULIE Wearing them?  Or humping them? \nTED My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs. \nJULIE That's refreshingly deviant. \nTED What about you? \nJULIE I'm very aural. \nTED Tell me more. \nJULIE Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch. \nTED (feigning a deep voice) I see. \nJULIE I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me. \nTED (jealous) A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very \"Cosmo.\" \nJULIE You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust. \nTED Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming. \nJULIE You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever. \nAt that moment, the TORCH SINGER begins crooning \"PEOPLE.\" \nTED Do you trust me, Julie? \nJULIE Not a chance. \nTED Come on. \nJULIE Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire. \nTed leans even closer. Looking into her eyes. Using his voice. Being as aurally seductive as he can. \nTED I want you to trust me. \nJULIE Maybe someday. \nTED Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do. \nUNCLE BILLY The kid came up with something that sounded good on paper. Who knew our readers wouldn't dig it? \nTed bristles. THE KID?  The kid came up with something? \nHEAD OF MARKETING We tried to warn you. \nUNCLE BILLY Sometimes young people need to make their own mistakes. That's how they learn. \nTed can see that Uncle Billy's playing this out differently than he imagined. Giving Ted all the \"credit.\" \nTED (firmly; to Uncle Billy) It won't happen again. It will never happen again. \nINT. \"HEAVEN\" MANSION - TED'S OFFICE - DAY \nTed sits at his father's desk.  Going through paperwork. Figures.  Charts. Reports. CEO work.  In the b.g., he hears the PLAYFUL SOUNDS of women.  Which distract him. \nTed approaches the window and watches a group of girls splashing and playing in the pool. He looks sad. Helen enters behind him.  He turns to her. \nTED I always thought I wanted fame and fortune and beautiful women. But sometimes your dreams come true, and they cause you nothing but grief. I just want to chuck everything and sell the stupid magazine. It's not worth the pain. \nHelen takes Ted's hand, comfortingly. \nHELEN Come, let me show you something. \nINT. MANSION ATTIC - DAY \nHelen and Ted sit on old trunk. Helen holds a scrapbook in her arms. Explaining to Ted... \nHELEN Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar. \nTED You mean they knew who I was? \nHELEN They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them. \nCLOSE ON SCRAPBOOK \nWe see baby pictures of Ted, taken through the glass of a nursery. A newspaper photo of Ted playing a donkey in a nativity play. And clippings from Ted's high school newspaper. \nTED I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up. \nHELEN Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded \"Heaven,\" they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours. \nTED My legacy. \nHELEN Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it. \nTED They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much. \nHELEN I understand. \nTED And the girl I love, she hates \"Heaven.\" If I keep it, she'll never respect me. \nHELEN But how can you respect yourself if you don't? \nINT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - DAY \nTed's parents and Jimmy walk through the front door. They're stunned to find a huge 24x36 enlarged family portrait, hanging over the mantle. It's the same picture Ted broke in his childish tantrum. Mom and Dad are moved. Even more so when they see Ted. Waiting for them on the couch.  Ted rises. Misty eyed. \nTED Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me? \nMOM (hugging him) Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much. \nDAD You were always our number one son. \nJIMMY (rolling his eyes) Mom, Dad. This display of unconditional love is appalling. \nMOM We are a FAMILY. \nJIMMY A family, need I remind you, that HE ridiculed and left for dead. \nTED Shut your pie hole, Jimmy. \nDAD I will not have my boys arguing. \nJIMMY So, when I'm seventeen, can I turn everyone's life upside-down, behave like a total piece of canine excrement, and then wipe the slate clean with a half-baked apology and a Kodak moment? \nCLOSE ON MAGAZINE \nWe see a special dedication, \"To Julie, My Partner in Crime, With All the Love in the World.\" Julie's eyes fill with tears. She flips ahead to \"The Girls of Xenia\" pictorial, only to find-- \nPrincipal Merkin. Singing his heart out, in drag as Barbra Streisand. It's a series of shots from the Cincinnati nightclub. Other shots suggestively include him with Molly in the foreground, as if they posed together. \nJULIE Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism. \nCHARLIE He kicked major ass and you know it. \nINT. MERKIN'S HONDA CIVIC - MOVING - DAY \nPrincipal Merkin drives. The RADIO plays in the b.g. As one song ends, we hear the DJ say... \nDJ This one's for you Dick Merkin of Tecumseh High. From all your students. With hugs and kisses. \nThe voice of Barbra Streisand fills the car. \nBARBRA STREISAND (ON THE RADIO) \"People/People who need People/Are the luckiest people in the world.\" \nPrincipal Merkin pales.  He turns off the radio.  But somehow, he can still hear the song.  As he pulls into the school parking lot, students wave enthusiastically.  He waves back tentatively.  Anxiety rising. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY \nPrincipal Merkin swings open his car door to be greeted by the sound of Barbra singing her heart out through the parking lot. Every student's car stereo blasts the song. Students CHEER. Chanting:  \"BAR-BRA, BAR-BRA, BAR-BRA!\"  Principal Merkin turns crimson. \nEXT. SCHOOL STADIUM - DAY \nGraduation caps fall all around. People hugging, laughing, overjoyed. Ted searches for Julie, but she's nowhere in sight. \nINT./EXT. NELSON'S HOUSE - EVENING \nA big graduation party in progress. But Ted sits in the corner, looking sad, dejected. Julie didn't show up. He blew it. Jimmy and Charlie approach, with cheering on their minds. \nJIMMY Why so melancholy? \nCHARLIE You were born naked, wet, and hungry. Now you're hip, handsome, and rich. You are the coxswain on the ship of life. \nJIMMY Eat, Drink, and Screw Mary! \nCHARLIE (proudly) I taught him that. \nTED Great. \nJIMMY From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big. \nCHARLIE You got everything you ever wanted. \nTED Except the girl. The only one that really mattered. \nJULIE (O.S.) And who might that be?  Miss July? Miss August? \nTed turns to find Julie. His faces brightens with hope. \nTED Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again. \nJULIE I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams. \nTED I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know. \nJulie seems pleased. \nTED (CONT'D) And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a \"coxswain.\" \nJULIE Very ambitious. I like that. \nTED The thing is, I'll need a first mate. \nJULIE I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board. \nAll kidding aside, he speaks from the heart... \nTED Julie, you were right. All the naked girls in the world mean nothing. It's the one you want to cover up with your coat that you really love. \nJulie smiles... \n", "test1_input": "\"HEAVEN\" WAR ROOM \nPOLAROIDS OF NAKED WOMEN cover every square inch of wall space.  Ted and Charlie gawk.  Who can blame them? \nUNCLE BILLY Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right. \nCHARLIE Let me get this straight... \nUNCLE BILLY If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor. \nCHARLIE These are real, live women? \nUNCLE BILLY (winking at Ted) We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it. \nCHARLIE God, I love being dead. \nTed focuses on one particular picture. He removes the push pin that holds it to the wall. \nTED I like her. \nWe can see the concerned look on Helen's face. Does this kid have any taste at all? \nHELEN (relieved) Nice choice. There's only one problem. \nShe shows Uncle Billy. \nUNCLE BILLY You think she upgraded? \nHELEN They went in through the belly button. \nUncle Billy nods. He explains gently... \nUNCLE BILLY We don't allow TIPN, Ted. \nTED Tipping? \nHELEN TIPN. Tattoos, implants, piercings, nose jobs. Our angels must be pure, unadultered, completely natural. \nTed looks at the walls again. Carefully. He has a knack for this. He hands a picture to Helen. She turns to Uncle Billy and smiles. \nHELEN (CONT'D) (emotional) You have your father's eye. \nHis father. He just can't get used to that. Who was this guy? \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM CLOSET - \"HEAVEN\" MANSION - NIGHT \nTed looks at the impressive collection of suits. Runs his hands along the fabrics. Picks a particularly stylish jacket and tries it on. It fits poorly. Too big in the chest and shoulders. Ted looks at himself in the full-length mirror. He's not half the man his father was. \nSuddenly there's a KNOCK on the door. Ted quickly takes off his father's jacket and puts on his own. He lets Uncle Billy in.  LOUD PARTY SOUNDS momentarily pour into the room. \nUNCLE BILLY There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right? \nTED Yeah.  Everything's cool. \nTed's struggling with a silk tie. Uncle Billy helps him. \nUNCLE BILLY You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you. \nTED Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression. \nUNCLE BILLY (puzzled) They said that? Really? (realizing) Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that. \nTed wipes his palms on his slacks. Confiding... \nTED Truth is, I'm a little nervous. \nUNCLE BILLY YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous? \nTED All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure. \nUNCLE BILLY Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure! \nTED I do? \nUNCLE BILLY You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms. \n", "test1_true": "UNCLE BILLY CONT'D) You are the Emperor of every little girl who dreamed of growing up to see her naughty bits spread eagle, airbrushed to glossy perfection, with staples through her ass. \nUncle Billy rubs his shoulders. As if pep-talking him for a big fight. \nUNCLE BILLY You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus. \nTED Me? The King of Coitus? \nUNCLE BILLY The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality. \nTED Whoa. But...that's the thing... (he whispers) I've never even actually... \nUNCLE BILLY (interrupting) Why, look who's here. \nUncle Billy swings the door open to reveal. KIKI and KELLY. Tall, beautiful, leggy IDENTICAL TWINS.  They smile warmly at Ted, each offering an arm.  Ted holds his head high. Like the Sovereign of Sexuality. \nLONG DRAMATIC STAIRCASE \nWith the twins on either side of him, Ted struts down the stairs and into a sea of people.  All so eager to meet him. Ted acts as if he's been doing this all his life. \nTED (sotto) The Potentate of Poon has arrived. \nAnd instantly, he's surrounded.  People shake his hands. Women kiss his cheeks.  Athletes, movie stars, models. Charlie watches, beaming proudly. \nDANCE FLOOR - LATER \nCharlie thinks he's Travolta. Dressed for disco. Twirling a Super Model. Ted dances among a dozen BEAUTIES.  They steal kisses and hugs, here and there. A thousand Cinderellas, all after one Prince Charming.  Ted's having the time of his life. Charlie dances up to him. Shouting in his ear... \nCHARLIE Ain't life amazing? A week ago, you couldn't get to second base!  Now you OWN second base! \nThey high-five one another. An EXOTIC BEAUTY grabs Ted and starts dirty dancing. Rubbing herself against him.  Ted's clueless. So he improvises.  People cheer him on.  He thrusts his pelvis. Feigns various sex acts. Hilarious, goofy, but it works. \nEXT. JACUZZI - NIGHT \nThe party's over.  Ted relaxes in the Jacuzzi, sipping champagne. Thrilled, elated, blasted.  Uncle Billy sits across from him.  Two MASSEUSES tenderize their shoulders. But as the scene continues the women take an even greater interest in each other. Stealing a kiss here. A touch there. Ted attention is distracted as he chats with Uncle Billy. \nUNCLE BILLY I told you you could do it. \nTED I was like a different person tonight. \nUNCLE BILLY You were the new and improved you. \nTED I would have been laughed right out of Xenia. \nUNCLE BILLY No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank. \nTED It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days. \nUNCLE BILLY You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine. \nTED Really? You'd do that for me? \nUNCLE BILLY I've been very lazy for a long, long time. \nTED You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy. \nUNCLE BILLY (confiding) I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second. \nTED My parents always say hard work builds character. \nUNCLE BILLY It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts. \nTED What kind of ideas? \nUNCLE BILLY Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of \"classic beauty.\" \nTED You think we should be more open minded? \nUNCLE BILLY The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine. \nTED In other words, our scope is too narrow. \nUNCLE BILLY At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down. \nTED That's perfect. \n", "test1_id": 1230, "test2_input": "But Molly pulls off her panties and flings them at him. \nINT. TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - DESK AREA - THAT NIGHT \nUncle Billy chortles, his image glowing on a large flat screen monitor that hangs on the wall.  Ted leans back in his chair. \nTED I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red. \nUNCLE BILLY I can't wait to see the pictures. \nTED It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything. \nUncle Billy grins proudly at Ted. \nUNCLE BILLY Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you? \nTED Seriously? I'm doing all right? \nUNCLE BILLY You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this \"stuff\" spoil you. \nTed knows it's not true. He looks guilty. \nTED I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost. \nUNCLE BILLY I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up. \nTED Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents. \nUncle Billy forces a laugh. \nUNCLE BILLY Why don't you come to town this weekend? We could play some golf, chase some skirts. \nTed smiles at the appealing offer. \nTED I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking. \nUNCLE BILLY You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print. \nTED Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything. \nUNCLE BILLY You're a great kid. Don't you forget it. \nWith that, he's gone. The room is completely silent. And Ted is completely alone. \nUNTIL the doorbell CHIMES. \nTED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - ENTRY WAY - NIGHT \nTed opens the door. It's Jimmy, with his shiny new bike. \nTED James, what are you doing here? \nJIMMY You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious. \nTED Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know? \nJIMMY She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother. \nTED It's really late...do your parents know where you are? \nJAMES Mom and Dad think I'm tucked safely in bed and that's all they need to know. Will this discussion be continuing in the hallway, or somewhere slightly more inviting? \nTED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM \nJimmy seems impressed by the opulence. He takes off his bike helmet, looks around. \nJIMMY Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house. \nTED Most places are, Jimmy. \nJIMMY They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile. \nTED So, what brings you here at his hour? \nJIMMY My new bike. \n", "test2_true": "JIMMY I came to ask permission to take custody of your room. \nTED My room? \nJIMMY Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer. \nTED It's not up to me. \nJIMMY Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home. \nTED You can have it, then. I'm not going back there. \nJimmy whips out a piece of paper from his pocket. \nJIMMY If you could just sign right there. \nTED You want it in writing? \nJIMMY Just a formality. \nTed signs. Jimmy squirrels away the paper, excitedly. Starts to zip up his wind breaker. \nTED That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff. \nJIMMY Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time. \nTED Are they okay? \nJIMMY Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better. \nTED I miss them, too. \nJIMMY You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine. \nTED You're a peach. \nJIMMY Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer. \nOuch. For the first time, that really smarts. \nTED He was my Grandfather, too. \nJIMMY I meant biologically. \nTED That's a crappy thing to say. \nJIMMY Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy. \nTed listens. \nJIMMY (CONT'D) But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids. \nTED I didn't forget. \nJIMMY You ever look down on them again and call them \"grocers\" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it? \nTed's stunned. Talk about tough love. \nTED Loud and clear. \nSuddenly the phone rings. Ted sheepishly explains... \nTED (CONT'D) That's probably my office. \nINT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJULIE Well? Where the hell are you? \nINTERCUT BETWEEN TED AND JULIE \nTED He's on the move? \nJULIE I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati. \nTED Let's do it. \n", "test2_id": 1231, "test3_input": "TED That was code for \"I like you.\" \nChristy giggles. \nCHRISTY Wanna unzip me? \nTed slowly unzips Christy's top, catching a glimpse of her long, sensuous back. She resumes posing. Flashing a bare shoulder.  A coy look. She doesn't need direction. She's a natural. \nCHRISTY (CONT'D) Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess. \nTED I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence. \nCHRISTY Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself. \nChristy slips off her cheerleader top. Lowers her skirt. Flings it aside. She's wearing only panties the size of a Band-aid. Ted is mute. Staring at her perfect body. \nCHRISTY (CONT'D) Well? \nTED You have changed since second grade. \nCHRISTY I mean, what do you think? \nTED You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain. \nCHRISTY Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny. \nTed steps out of the shower.  Out of Christy's sight, he squirms in his jeans. Trying to hide his enthusiasm. \nMUSIC suddenly seems to come from nowhere. Nine Inch Nails. \"I Want to Fuck You Like An Animal.\" \nTED (sotto) God help me. \nTed steps back into the shower.  Christy rubs an ice cube on her left nipple. \nCHRISTY I heard they do this on photo shoots.  Wanna to do the other one? \nShe tosses him the ice cube. He fumbles. It lands on the floor. \nTED You're doing just fine, Christy. Believe me. \nCHRITY Then I'm ready when you are. \nTed looks through the lens. We can see him trembling.  Music blasts as Ted's camera burns through film.  They're both getting into it.  Water pulsating over her body. Steam rising.  Christy begins lathering her breasts. \nCHRISTY I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you. \nTED Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse. \nCHRISTY Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces. (she smiles, sexily) Are you hungry? \nIs he hungry. He's been working up this appetite for ten years. He can barely contain himself. \nTED God, you are so hot. \nCHRISTY Then you better get in the water, before you get burned. \nTed calls her bluff. He sets aside his camera. Walks right into the water. Through the steam.  Toward Christy. She wraps a leg around him, sucking face, wanting more. \nCHRISTY (CONT'D) You and me, finally. This will be so fantastic, Teddy Bear. Trust me. \nSuddenly Ted stops. Remembering what Julie said about trust. \nTED I'm sorry, Christy. I've been crazy about you forever, and this is definitely a page right out of my palm pilot, but I just can't go through with it. \nHe turns away, but Christy presses her bare body against his back.  Wrapping her hands around his waist. Caressing his chest, his stomach... \nCHRISTY Sure you can. You're only human. It's not like you're made of steel. (she lowers her hand) Or ARE you? \nSMASH CUT TO: \nTed and Christy locked in a steamy embrace. Rolling on the floor. Hands, arms, lips, tongues, all in motion. As the shower drenches them. \nSuddenly, they roll into a pair of legs.  Both look up.  The steam clears to reveal Julie. Arms crossed. Hurt, but not surprised. \nJULIE What's up, doc? \n", "test3_true": "TED Wait, Julie, wait! \nINT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nJulie dashes out of the girls' locker room, passing a JANITOR.  Ted follows, dripping water. \nJANITOR I'm sorry, Mr. Ted. She pushed right past me. \nTED (calling after Julie) At least let me explain! \nJulie darts into the girls' restroom.  Ted stops at the door. Then realizes there is no one else around.  He heads inside. \nINT. GIRLS' RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJulie's too proud to let him see her cry. But we can tell she's upset. \nJULIE Go away, Ted. Just go. \nTed corners her near a row of sinks. \nTED Please believe me. It was just a kiss for old time's sake. I've had a stupid crush on her since I was seven, but I never got closer to her than four feet and then there she was right in front of me, completely naked. \nJulie looks at him, pensively. She unzips the back of her summery dress. And lets it fall to the floor. She's completely naked and absolutely gorgeous. \nTed gasps. He's been around dozens of naked women by now, but this one he can't just gawk at. This one he really cares about. \nJULIE Being naked is no big deal. It has nothing to do with emotion, nothing to do with love. You can be around all the naked girls you want and you won't be even one step closer to anything meaningful in your life. \nShe puts on her dress, gracefully. As if nothing happened. \nJULIE (CONT'D) See that? You don't know me even one ounce better than you did before. You and your stupid magazine. I liked you better when you were sweet and kind and human, like the rest of us. \nAt that moment, Ted's cell phone rings. Julie walks away, leaving Ted completely alone. He answers, lifelessly... \nTED Yes? \nUNCLE BILLY (O.S.) We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk. \nINT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY \nTed walks down the hallway.  Three JOCKS look through the new issue of \"Heaven.\" Laughing.  They taunt Ted. \nJOCK #1 You got a great sense of humor. I love the three hundred pound Eskimo chick. \nJOCK #2 You like Eskimo pie, Teddy? \nJOCK #3 I like the African chick with the big lip. You could stash a lot of weed in there. Maybe even a six pack. \nTed's mortified, depressed. Charlie appears next to him with \"Heaven\" in hand. \nCHARLIE Holy stinkers, what were you thinking? \nTED We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world. \nCHARLIE Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold. \nPrincipal Merkin approaches. Also holding \"Heaven\" in his hand. \nPRINCIPAL MERKIN Ted, I realize I owe you an apology. You're destroying \"Heaven\" much faster from the inside than I ever could from the outside. Good job, son. \nTed could not feel worse. \nINT. \"HEAVEN\" MANSION - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nTed, Uncle Billy, and Helen. Meeting with the HEADS OF VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS. \nHEAD OF MARKETING Our advertisers are wigging out. Half of them are threatening to pull their ads for next month. The other half already did. \nUNCLE BILLY It was nothing more than beginner's folly. Tell everyone to lighten up. \nHELEN It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again. (the words pain her) Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation. \nTED Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal. \nHEAD OF FINANCE Another disaster like this could sink us. We've got thousands of subscribers requesting refunds. \n", "test3_id": 1232}

MAZZIOLI ... it's in regulations. You've got a right to complain. You've got a right to take your case to the Inspector General. Any soldier has, even a plain dogface. 
PREW I know it. I'm not complainin to nobody. They ain't goin to get the satisfaction of seein me squirm. 
Clark begins to play the bugle softly along with the jukebox music, noodling an uninspired obligato. 
MAGGIO (pointing to pictures) ... believe it nor not, this is one soljer who's got a family -- look, fifteen of 'em. (MORE) MAGGIO(CONT'D) See that old man with the handlebars? (PROUDLY) Mr. Maggio is my father. 
MAZZIOLI Listen, Prew. I guess I ought not to tell you but --. Warden hasn't had you on KP much lately, has he? 
PREW Only my reglar turn. 
MAZZIOLI Well -- I was working in the Orderly Room this afternoon and I heard the Captain telling Warden you're to pull KP every weekend from now on. You know what that means -- you can' t even go into TOWN -- 
PREW Whadda they want? They done everything, now they look me in a box! What else they gonna try? 
Clark hits a sour note an the bugle. 
PREW (SAVAGELY) When you gonna learn to play a bugle!? 
In overwhelming, uncontrollable protest, Prew slaps the bugle away from Clark's mouth. In one motion he wipes the mouthpiece on his sleeve, raises it to his lips and blows his own wild, violent obligato to the jukebox music. 
FULL SHOT CHOY'S as Prew plays on, the bugle's pure tone pealing through the room. Everyone puts down his beer, stops talking and turns toward Prew. 
CLOSE SHOT WARDEN reacting. He frowns, moved by the cry behind the music. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW'S TABLE FEATURING MAGGIO as he watches and listens, an exultation for his friend nakedly revealed on his face. 
ANOTHER ANGLE PREW'S TABLE FEATURING PREW Hitting an almost impossibly high note, he stops as suddenly as he has begun. He has played perhaps fifteen seconds in 
all. He puts the bugle down on the table, embarrassed now, the violence gone, some of the wrath unloaded. 
MEDIUM SHOT AT DOOR The room is quiet for several moments, except for the continuing jukebox music, which sounds pale and thin now. Fatso Judson strolls in, stands at the door. Some of the men see him, but no one greets him. Fatso threads his way between tables as the room slowly begins to return to normal and the men turn back to their beer. 
MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE as Fatso passes. He stops, leans over Anderson's shoulder to look at the snapshots on the table. He points to one picture, a pretty young girl of about fifteen, posing Hollywoodishly in a bathing suit, cracks his knuckles loudly. 
FATSO Who's that? Who's that dame? 
MAGGIO (IMPASSIVELY) My sister. 
Fatso whistles. He picks up the photograph, stares at it, whistles again. 
FATSO Whoever! Say, she's a real good piece of whistle bait! I'd sure like to get my mitts around her. 
He laughs complacently at his own wit, tosses the picture on the table, starts to move on, Maggio rises, picks up the heavy wooden stool he's been sitting on and smashes it down on Fatso's head with all his strength, 
ANOTHER ANGLE as again the laughing and shouting in the room stops abruptly. Fatso reels a little with the terrible blow but does not go down. 
FATSO Why, holy -- I You hit met You hit me! 
MAGGIO (CALMLY) You bet your life. (RAISES STOOL) And about to do it again. 
FATSO (still blinking from the BLOW) What?! But what for? That's no way to fight! (reaches hand to head, brings away blood) Why, you dirty yellow sneaking -- Wop! You yellow little Wop! If that's the way you want to play! 
With his last sentence, Fatso whips out a knife and snaps open the blade. The blade is at least five inches long. It glints evilly as he raises it. There is a concerted whisking intake of breath from the room. Murder is clear on Fat sots face. 
MEDIUM SHOT NEAR PREW'S TABLE (EXCLUDING WARDEN) Maggio, holding the stool high, backs up a few feet as Fatso advances toward him. Men sprawl away from them. 
SOLDIER'S VOICE Hey, it you want to fight, fight with fists. Take it outsides 
There is a murmur of agreement from the crowd. A couple of men are about to rise. Fatso whirls toward them. 
FATSO I'm gonna cut this little Wop's heart out. Anybody steps in here, I give it to him first. 
MEDIUM SHOT OLD CHOY AND YOUNG CHOY side by side. Old Choy watches, immobile, his slit eyes almost closed. Young Choy is shaking with fright. 
MEDIUM SHOT FATSO AND MAGGIO Fatso turns toward Maggio, who circles back around the table as the other stalks him. 
MAGGIO (scared but brave; shouts) I'm gunna de-brain ya, Fatso! One step closer an I'm gunna kill ya! 
Fatso has his knife poised at his shoulder, ready to strike. Warden comes into shot suddenly. He brandishes a beer bottle wildly, looks like an avenging spirit of authority. 
WARDEN Nobody's gunna do nothin! Anybody's killin anybody around here, it'll be me! 
Warden snatches another beer bottle from a table, now has one in each hand. He steps between Fatso and Maggio. 
FATSO Look outs here, Warden. This a private affair. 
WARDEN No it ain't! This man's in my Compny an I'm responsible for him. And you ain't makin two weeks extra paper work for me by killin him. Nor him you. Put that knife down! 
He smashes the neck off one of the beer bottles, points the wagged edge at Fatso, roars: 
WARDEN Put it down! 
Fatso slowly lowers the knife to his waist, but keeps it pointed towards Maggio and Warden. Warden deliberately turns his back to Fatso, spits his words at Maggio. 
WARDEN Killer! You unweaned punk& Come on, you want some killing, come on! (whirls on Fatso) Come on, barrelbelly. Ain't you comin? 
Neither Fatso nor Maggio moves. 
WARDEN (with mammoth contempt) Killers! You'll get plenty of killing, all right. More than you got the stomach for. You'll be in a war one of these days. When you feel that lead from a sniper's rifle hit you between the eyes, come and tell me how you like it. Killers! (turns to Maggio) Now put down that chair. 
Maggio puts down the stool. Warden turns to Fatso. 
WARDEN Throw that knife on the floor.

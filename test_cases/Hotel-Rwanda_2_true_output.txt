LITTLE BOY (O.S.) Mr. Manager. 
Paul wipes his eyes, turns. 
A little boy stands behind him, holding out his arm. 
LITTLE BOY (CONT'D) Mr. Manager, sir. 
Then Paul sees what is wrong. The boy Has a big thorn imbedded in the muscle of his arm. Paul studies it. 
PAUL That's a big one. (pinches the thorn) Here we go.

Paul picks him up, carries him to the pool, throws him in.

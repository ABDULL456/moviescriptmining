IOSEF ENTERS- 
VIGGO (in Russian, subtitled) Close the door. 
-and closes the door behind him, tilting his chin towards his father with a smirk. 
IOSEF Poor me a double, aye? 
VIGGO (SIGHS) Aye. 
In a surprising blur of motion, Viggo spins- 
-and drives a fist into Iosef's stomach with enough force to lift him -momentarily- from the ground. 
With the wind knocked out of him, Iosef drops to his knees, opens his mouth to say something, but instead vomits, gagging as he gasps for breath. 
Viggo casually returns to the bar, grabs a towel, and tosses it down onto his son. 
VIGGO (CONT'D) (in Russian, subtitled) Clean that up. 
Again, Iosef opens his mouth to say something, but decides otherwise. He grabs the towel and cleans up his mess. 
Viggo takes his drink and walks to the window, his cigarette smoldering from the corner of his lips. 
VIGGO (CONT'D) You should know by now that I live by one simple rule... (in Russian, subtitled) Should a whelp snap at your fingers, you crush it's fucking skull. 
Iosef pulls himself to his feet, and stumbles to the bar, pouring himself a drink. 
IOSEF (hushed, pained) What'd I do? 
VIGGO (in Russian, subtitled) You fucked up. 
IOSEF I don't know what y- 
Viggo backhands him, the sound more painful than the strike. 
VIGGO Yes.   You do. 
IOSEF (hesitating, then) So I stole a fucking car!   So fucking what? 
Viggo smiles -amused- finishes his drink... 
...and drives a fist into Iosef's stomach again, dropping him once more to his knees, tears rolling down his cheeks as he vomits up his own drink. 
VIGGO Use that tone with me again... 
Viggo kneels down next to Iosef, grabs his hair, pulls back his head, produces a switchblade, flicking open the blade and placing it to the flesh directly beneath his son's right eye. 
VIGGO (CONT'D) (in Russian, subtitled) ...and I'll serve your eye to you in your martini. 
Trembling, Iosef chokes back tears. 
VIGGO (CONT'D) (in Russian, subtitled) Am I understood? 
IOSEF (gulps, then) Yes... father. 
A beat... and Viggo removes the blade from Iosef's cheek and stands, folding the switchblade closed as he stands to pour himself another drink. 
VIGGO It wasn't the "what you did", Iosef, which draws my ire, but "who you did it to". 
IOSEF What? (a beat, then) The old man? 
VIGGO Careful, son... that old man happens to be three years younger than I. 
Iosef lowers his eyes, his breath catching in the back of his throat. 
VIGGO (CONT'D) His name is John Wick... (smirks at the memory) ...and when he was fifteen, he lied his way into the marines and headed off to Vietnam. He specialized in force-oriented reconnaissance, meaning he often crossed over into enemy territory to both collect information and -should the opportunity present itself- fuck with the enemy in whatever way that he saw fit. 
EXT. THE WICK HOME - ESTABLISHING - CONTINUOUS 
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Wearing an undershirt and pants, sweating profusely, John wields a SLEDGEHAMMER which he swings down onto the floor time and time again, cracking the concrete foundation. 
VIGGO(V.O.) John earned four hundred and seventeen confirmed kills over the course of his five tours. The majority of those were done by hand, by blade, and by small caliber... which is unheard of. 
INT. A TOWNHOUSE - THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS 
Viggo takes a long pull off of his drink as the information sinks into Iosef, the blood draining from his face. 
VIGGO It got to him, though. Hell... How could it not? Even though he won every military distinction on record, including the Medal of HONOR- 
INT. THE WICK HOME - THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

INT. NASA - PRESS ROOM - DAY 
ANNIE MONTROSE stands at her place at the podium. Annie's a little older, a little wiser, but can still command a room. 
ANNIE The Ares 5 team will rendezvous with the Hermes approximately 48 minutes after launch. From there, they've got 414 days of space travel ahead of them, arriving at Mars on March 30th. And I'll let the Director of Mars Missions, Vincent Kapoor, brief you on the particulars. 
VINCENT steps to the podium. He's calm. At ease. Much better on television than we've ever seen him. 
VINCENT Good morning. Their mission is scheduled for 41 Sols. Your briefs detail the research and experiment schedules... 
And the MUSIC CONTINUES THROUGHOUT as... 
INT. NASA - MISSION CONTROL 
The room is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY as they prepare for launch. 
MINDY PARK takes her place at her STATION. She's moved up in the world, now bears the title of: 
MINDY Flight, CAPCOM. Ready to begin preflight check. 
BRENDAN HATCH takes his place as the new FLIGHT DIRECTOR. 
BRENDAN Go ahead, CAPCOM. 
UP ABOVE: In the VIEWING ROOM... TEDDY SANDERS watches the activity from his solitary seat. He has his GREEN FOLDER at the ready beside him. 
EXT. JPL - MORNING 
A DEER trots through JPL grounds... it's still early yet at the Jet Propulsion Labs in Pasadena.... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
But BRUCE NG is awake. And he still looks as exhausted and rumpled as ever. But he's in a good mood. He eats breakfast with his team outside as they watch the news reports detailing the "ARES 5 LAUNCH." 
Bruce and his team laugh, make jokes with each other. One of them tosses food to the deer. 
INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY 
"People all over the world, join in..." 
Five BEAUTIFUL BLONDE CHILDREN race through the house, wearing NASA t-shirts and jumpsuits -- we get the sense this is the Superbowl for this family. 
ALEX VOGEL grabs his youngest daughters as they race past. He scoops them up in his arms. They laugh and laugh. 
INT. SPACECRAFT - DAY 
The Ares 5 astronauts secure themselves into their acceleration chairs. We settle on one astronaut: 
WEN JIANG. The first Chinese national to go to Mars. 
CAPCOM (OVER COMMS) Guidance. 
WEN Go. 
INT. NASA - MISSION CONTROL 
ZHU TAO and GUO MING stand at the back of the room, listening with pride as Wen runs through his check. A historic moment for their country. 
EXT. PARK - MORNING 
MITCH HENDERSON watches his grandson run around the park. We get the sense (the forced) retirement is treating him well. 
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
"Let this train keep on riding, riding on through..." 
CHRIS BECK accepts a bouquet of flowers from a nurse. Sets them down next to the others as he checks on... 
His wife. BETH JOHANSSEN. Who's holding THEIR NEWBORN BABY GIRL in her arms. 
Beck climbs into the hospital bed next to them. 
INT. SPACECRAFT - DAY 
As we hear the TIMER CONTROLLER initiate the COUNTDOWN... 
TIMER CONTROLLER (OVER COMMS) 
We settle on the final member of the ARES 5 team: 
RICK MARTINEZ. He grins as he feels that all-too-familiar surge of adrenaline. Here we go again... 
INT. HOUSE - DAY 
We're MOVING DOWN THE HALLWAY of a quaint house. On the WALLS: vintage albums and posters... 
Donna Summer's LAST DANCE on 7"... C'est Chic... A framed top that looks like something Gloria Gaynor wore... 
TIMER CONTROLLER (OVER COMMS) 
And mixed in among the glittery paraphernalia: 
The NASA Distinguished Service Medal... The Congressional Medal of Honor... 
MELISSA LEWIS is glued to the television. She doesn't look up as her husband brings her a cup of tea. 
She's with the crew in this moment. Her husband doesn't take offense. He gives her a loving pat and exits.

It\u0092s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?! \nKATE (doubtful) Uh huh... \nKate notices the tray of mushroom puffs on the table. \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) You must really love Evelyn\u0092s mushroom puffs, huh?

I know it\u0092s a knock-off, but I think it\u0092ll look great on you... \nJACK (examining the label) Zeena... \nJack is overcome with emotion...Yes, it\u0092s a ZEENA, but this is probably the nicest thing anyone\u0092s ever done for him... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) (tearing up) You really are incredible... \nKATE Enjoy it, sweetheart... \nJack looks at Kate\u0092s expectant face, suddenly remembering how truly screwed he is. \nJACK You\u0092re probably expecting something from me... \nHe\u0092s sweating bullets...watching as Kate gets a quizzical look on her face... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Here\u0092s the thing.  I really hadn\u0092t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight. (an uncomfortable smile) You know, anniversary\u0092s good all day... \nKATE What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it\u0092s light out. \nJACK I know that, but... \nBeat.

I\u0092ll go out right now and get you something.  I\u0092ll make it right. \nThat didn\u0092t help. \nKATE (holding back the tears) Jesus, Jack...Is this where we are now?  Is this our marriage? Suddenly I\u0092m the wife who has to drop hints two weeks before her anniversary so her husband doesn\u0092t fuck it up? \nJack sees a tear run down her face...a pang of guilt on his... \nJACK Please don\u0092t cry... \nKate wipes the tear away but they just keep coming. \nKATE (shaking her head, crying) I don\u0092t want to be that, Jack... \nJack approaches her, holding out a hand but Kate pushes it away, gets up and walks toward the bathroom... \nJack is left standing alone, holding Kate\u0092s gift... \nCUT TO: \n76\tINT.

He RINGS the bell again, louder this time, really trying to attract someone\u0092s attention. \nJACK C\u0092mon...c\u0092mon... \nNothing.  Finally, he lifts the bike up in the air, RINGING the bell with everything he\u0092s got... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) (shouting to the sky) C\u0092mon, goddamnit, how was I supposed to know the date of their anniversary!?

CAMPBELL HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING \nJack is mixing a glass of chocolate milk.  Annie, arms folded, is waiting expectantly.  He finishes, sliding the glass to her. \nShe takes a long sip, puts the glass down, a chocolate milk mustache on her lip. \nANNIE Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary. \nJACK Like what? \nANNIE One year he had a solar system named after her... \nJACK Don\u0092t you think that\u0092s a little gimmicky? \nANNIE Mom liked it. \nJack raises an eyebrow. \nJACK Maybe there\u0092s a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something. \nANNIE That\u0092s good but...you did forget the anniversary. \nJACK Right.  That\u0092s a major oversight... (thinking aloud) So if I\u0092m Kate...I can\u0092t really afford the finer things, my husband\u0092s career is a crushing disappointment to me, I\u0092m trapped in suburbia... \nThen... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Did he ever take her to the City? \nAnnie smiles, impressed. \nANNIE You\u0092re really gettin\u0092 the hang of this. \nSuddenly, a look of confidence comes over Jack\u0092s face. For the first time, he seems like a man in control. \n78\tINT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nAnnie is sitting on the bed watching her mother get dressed. \nKate, wearing a silky slip, walks out of her closet carrying two dresses on hangers, a red one and a sexy little black one. \nKate holds out the two dresses to Annie. \nKATE Which do you think? \nAnnie thinks about it for a moment, taking it very seriously... \nANNIE The black one... \nKate nods.  She\u0092s about to put it on when she looks at Annie... \nKATE Fighting\u0092s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right? \nANNIE I\u0092m not worried, Mom. He\u0092s still learning our ways... \nKate looks at her with a raised eyebrow, then nods. It\u0092s true.  She puts down the dress and holds out a hand to Annie. \nKATE C\u0092mere. \nKate leads her to the makeup table, then opens a lipstick... \nANNIE (excited) Really? \nKate nods then applies some red lipstick to Annie\u0092s lips. \nKATE Now go like this... \n", "test2_id": 115, "test3_input": "HECTOR ...I say to her, Margarita, we already have four kids, why do we need more? \nJack is shaking his leg anxiously under the desk as he eyes the door...

LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER \nJack and Lassiter walk together... \nLASSITER ...we\u0092re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see... \nJACK But you\u0092re not interested in boutique dollars...

ALAN MINTZ\u0092S OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nPast the assistant\u0092s desk... \nMINTZ\u0092S ASSISTANT (seeing Lassiter) He\u0092s expecting you, Mr. Lassiter... \nLassiter doesn\u0092t even slow down... \n99\tINT. ALAN MINTZ\u0092S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nIt\u0092s Jack\u0092s old office but you wouldn\u0092t know it from the decor...lots of country pine, a fabric sofa, and a play pen where the bar used to be.  Jack enters, immediately struck by the difference... \nLASSITER (to Mintz) Alan, this is Jack Campbell...the one I was telling you about... \nMintz, a confident look on his face, gets up from the desk and goes to shake Jack\u0092s hand. \nALAN Jack, of course. \nThey shake hands. \nJACK (appropriately deferential) Mr. Mintz. \nALAN Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here... \nJACK (re: play pen) I can see that, Alan. \nA chuckle from Mintz. \nALAN You have kids, Jack? \nJACK (hesitating, then...) Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones. \nAnother laugh from Mintz. \nALAN That\u0092s great... (gesturing to the sofa) Why don\u0092t you have a seat? \nJack nods, sits down on the plush sofa, Mintz and Lassiter take the chairs. \nALAN (CONT\u0092D) So, Peter mentioned that you were an avid CNBC watcher but didn\u0092t say whether you had any actual Wall Street experience? \nJack\u0092s a little taken aback by the question, not realizing he was walking into an interview... \nHe crosses his legs, trying to get comfortable. \nJACK I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton. \nALAN A broker? Really. And now you\u0092re in the tire business? \nJACK That\u0092s right. And auto supply... \nALAN Uh huh. The retail end, I understand. \nJack nods... \nJACK Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service. \nALAN Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark... \nJACK We did one point seven million in total revenue... \nALAN Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year? \nJack pauses, analyzing the situation...the patronizing questions, the smirk on Mintz\u0092s face... \nALAN (CONT\u0092D) Any thoughts at all on that? \nAs Jack stares into their faces, he realizes the extent of his handicap... \nALAN (CONT\u0092D) Jack? \nHe stops, takes a moment, looking at Mintz and Lassiter then ...a confident smile. \nJACK Well, Alan, I think we\u0092re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account. \n", "test3_true": "A gleam in Jack\u0092s eye. \nJACK That\u0092s right. And that would make us number one in our market... (getting up) You mind if I stand? \nA raised eyebrow from Mintz. \nMintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he crosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of water... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger... \nALAN I\u0092m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack. \nJACK (a confident chuckle) It\u0092s okay, Alan. I get it. I\u0092m in your shoes, I\u0092m thinking exactly the same thing...but here\u0092s the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, it\u0092s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell they\u0092re gonna send their kids to college.  It\u0092s just people... \nJack\u0092s confidence is throwing Mintz off, but Lassiter appears intrigued... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) And I know people. \nALAN I\u0092m sure you do... \nLASSITER (intervening) Let\u0092s let the man have his say... \nMintz covers his embarrassment with a smile... \nJACK (to Mintz) Take you, for instance... \nALAN (defensive) What about me? \nJACK You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You\u0092re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch... \nJack looks around the office then back to Mintz. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) And your wife decorated this office... \nA laugh from Lassiter as Mintz sits there stewing, a caught look on his face. \nLASSITER He certainly has your number, Alan. \nJACK (turning to Lassiter) You\u0092re a little tougher, Peter. \nA raised eyebrow from Lassiter, but he\u0092s game... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) For one thing, you like expensive things. \nLASSITER (smiling proudly) That\u0092s easy. You\u0092ve seen my car. \nJACK (a chuckle) Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You\u0092re a scotch man, single malt, not because it\u0092s trendy but because you\u0092ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand... \nLassiter\u0092s impressed. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) And you\u0092re a man who prides himself on finding talent in unusual places... \nLASSITER Oh? And how would you know that? \nJack smiles. \nJACK Because I\u0092m here. \nOn Lassiter...nodding his head. Mintz, a plastered-on smile. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) I\u0092m prepared to do anything it takes to get this job. Start anywhere you need me to start. I\u0092ll park cars if I to... (into Lassiter\u0092s eyes) The biggest part of judging character is knowing yourself. And I know this, I can do this job. Give me a chance, Peter, I won\u0092t let you down. \nLassiter returns Jack\u0092s gaze with equal intensity. In a moment, he turns to Mintz. \nLASSITER (to Mintz) Alan, why don\u0092t you show Jack around a bit... \nALAN I\u0092d love to. \nCUT TO: \n100\tINT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER \nJack and Alan walking side by side down the hallway... EMPLOYEES passing them by, greeting Mintz, Mintz waving back... \nALAN (pointing) ...that\u0092s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile. \nJACK (not particularly impressed) Seven.  Really. \nThey turn a corner, coming into a deserted section of the corridor. \nMintz stops, turning to Jack.  Jack returns Mintz\u0092s gaze with a quizzical look. \nALAN Let\u0092s cut the shit, huh Campbell? What, did you go through his wallet or something? \nJack\u0092s a little taken aback. \nALAN (CONT\u0092D) No matter. That circus act back there may have dazzled Lassiter momentarily but it doesn\u0092t do shit forme. Even if you get this job, which I highly doubt, let me warn you, Lassiter loses interest in his pet projects very quickly. I\u0092m in the big office because I\u0092ve proved myself to him year after year and nobody is going to come in here and start turning the old man\u0092s head. Especially not some tire salesman from New Jersey. So you watch yourself and stay away from Lassiter, and maybe, just maybe, I\u0092ll keep you on after he gets tired of you. Do we understand each other? \nJack stands there, staring at Mintz, silent, expressionless. \nALAN (CONT\u0092D) Do we?! \nThen, a broad smile from Jack. \nJACK God, you really are different, aren\u0092t you... (nodding) I mean...wow...I am impressed. \nNow it\u0092s Mintz\u0092s turn to look quizzical. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Good for you.

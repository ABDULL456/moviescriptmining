{"train": "Family Man \nCHAPTER ONE - EARLY HISTORY \n1\tINT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, PAN AM TERMINAL - NIGHT \nSUPER:  AUTUMN, 1987 \nA line of PASSENGERS about to board a Pan Am flight to London. \nJACK CAMPBELL, 22, head full of long unkempt hair, Tom Selleck mustache,  the hopeful look of youth in his eyes... sitting next to... \nKATE REYNOLDS, 21, pretty, Dorothy Hamill haircut... rubbing the tears from  her swollen red eyes... \nKATE I got you a few necessities... \nKate hands Jack a new copy of Vonnegut\u0092s \u0093Cat\u0092s Cradle.\u0094 \nKATE  (CONT\u0092D) Your copy was a mess... \nJack accepts the book but he\u0092s unable to take his eyes off Kate.  She hands him a cassette. \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way... \nJACK All in one tape? \nKATE I also put side two of London Calling on there... \nKate leans over and kisses him passionately on the lips. \nKATE  (CONT\u0092D) That was not officially the goodbye kiss. It was just an interim kiss... \nHe looks at her, his eyes welling up. He pulls her close, kissing her deeply. Then... \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) This will be the final boarding call for Pan Am flight 4 to London, Heathrow. \nJack takes Kate\u0092s hand, getting up, turning sadly to the gate. \nKATE You have your ticket? \nJack pulls out a BLUE PAN AM TICKET ENVELOPE.  Kate nods. They embrace and kiss again.  As they separate. \nJACK I\u0092m not even gonna say it, Kate. Maybe it\u0092ll be like I never left... \nJack takes one lastlook at her, then heads for the gate. \nKate stands there, watching him go.  Then... \n...a  moment of intuition. Something isn\u0092t right. She looks at Jack, about to disappear into the jetway, trying to decide... \nKATE Wait. \nJack turns. Kate approaches him. \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) I have a bad feeling about this. \nJACK About the plane? What do you think it\u0092s gonna crash? Don\u0092t say that... \nKATE (shaking her head) I know we\u0092ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong. \nShe looks at the gate...the last few passengers are boarding, then back into Jack\u0092s eyes. \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) Don\u0092t  go, Jack... \nJACK You mean don\u0092t go at all? What about my internship? \nKATE Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you... \nJACK For us, Kate. \nKATE Right, for us. But...I\u0092m afraid that if you get on that plane... \nJACK What? \nKate looks at him, pleading with her eyes, but she can\u0092t say... \nKATE (torn) Go. I\u0092m sorry, you should just go... \nJACK (thinking, then...) No, you\u0092re right.  What are we doing? \nKATE We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane. \nHis eyes narrow as he measures her determination... \nKATE (CONT'D) (a smile) Get the hell outta my sight. You bother me. \nA laugh from Jack.  Kate gives him a calm smile and a nod - it's not entirely convincing but it's enough for Jack. \nJACK (resolute) Okay, I'm going... \nHe takes her in his arms one last time and hugs her tight.  Jack looks toward the gate, the line disappearing...Kate grasps his shirt tightly. \nKATE I can't seem to let go of you... \nJACK You hear me complaining about that? \nA sober look in Jack's eyes. \nJACK (CONT'D) Look, we're at the airport and no one ever thinks clearly at the airport so we should just trust the decision we already made.  You've been accepted to one of the best law schools in the country, I've got this internship at Barclay's Bank. We have a great plan, honey... \nKate nods, then, with resolve... \nKATE You want to do something great, Jack?  Let's flush the plan...start our lives right now, today...I don't know what that life's gonna look like but I do know it has both of us in it.  And I choose us... \nJack is jolted by her words. \nKATE (CONT'D) The plan doesn't make us great, Jack.  What we have together, that's what makes us great. \nHer words sink in...A long moment of decision...He looks toward the gate, only one person left in line...back to Kate...imploring him with her eyes. \nFinally...He kisses her deeply on the lips... \nJack\u0092s at the mirror in this incredibly neat marble- tiled bathroom, shaving with a silver-plated Hammacher Schlemmer razor, HUMMING with the orchestra... \n6\tINT. JACK\u0092S CLOSET - MORNING \n...the size of a small house, a long row of Zegna suits, shoe trees stacked with Italian shoes, tailored shirts everywhere. \nJack\u0092s still HUMMING to the music as he dresses in front of a mirror. \n7\tINT. ELEVATOR - MORNING \nJack, wearing an elegant camel\u0092s hair overcoat and carrying a leather briefcase, a \u0093Master of the Universe\u0094 smile on his face, now HUMMING the Bach piece from memory... \nThe doors open at 6.  Jack self-consciously stops singing as ELIZABETH PETERSON, 60s, wearing a mink coat, gets on the elevator carrying a yappy little dog. \nJACK (a charming smile) Mrs. Peterson. \nMRS. PETERSON Hello Jack.  You don\u0092t have to stop singing on my account... \nJACK It\u0092s because I\u0092m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me? \nMRS. PETERSON You know you could never satisfy me the way he does... \nThe doors open to the lobby.  Mrs. Peterson walks out ahead. \n8\tINT. JACK\u0092S BUILDING, LOBBY - MORNING \nTONY THE DOORMAN holds the door open for Jack and Mrs. Peterson... \nTONY THE DOORMAN Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell. \nJACK How\u0092d you do this year, Tony? \nTONY THE DOORMAN About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I\u0092m putting it all in commercial paper like you said. \nJACK Just until the Deutsche Mark turns... \nJack exits the building... \n9   OMITTED \n9A\tEXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING \nJack\u0092s Ferrari racing through the park... \n10\tEXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MORNING \nA modern Wall Street building.  The sign above the glass doors reads, \u0093P.K. Lassiter and Associates, Investment House.\u0094 \nThe Ferrari SCREECHES to a halt.  Jack gets out, heads into the building... \n10A\tINT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS \n...Jack throws his keys to a nearby SECURITY GUARD with a smile on his way to the elevators... \nCHAPTER THREE - JACK THE BUSINESSMAN \nDISSOLVE TO: \n11\tINT. LASSITER BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nThe Manhattan skyline shines through the windows of this beautiful conference room. \nSIX EXECUTIVES are seated at a huge oak table littered with coffee cups and lunch waste.  At the end of the table, ALAN MINTZ, 30s, balding, sits with a faraway look in his eyes, three empty Diet Coke cans in front of him. \nMintz is poking at a shiny gold cherub dangling from a small, plastic Christmas tree, sitting in the middle of the table. \nJack is addressing the group from the front of the room, standing in front of a computer with a huge flat screen monitor, covered with stock charts and tables... \nJACK ...if MedTech's shares sink any lower than... (casually executing a keystroke) ...forty three, we're in trouble with the stock valuation.  So for god's sake watch what you say to your institutional customers... \nJack notices Alan Mintz playing with the cherub. \nJACK (CONT'D) ...we still have almost a full day of trading before zero hour and I don't want any trouble... (distracted by Mintz) ...penny for your thoughts, Alan... \nAlan looks up. \nALAN Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all. \nJACK Is that tonight? \nA LAUGH from the group.  Jack approaches Alan. \nJACK (CONT'D) You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan? \nALAN I don't know.  Maybe... \nAnother LAUGH.  Even Jack lets out a good-natured chuckle. \nJACK Okay, maybe I do have a touch of tunnel vision this holiday season.  But in two days we're going to announce one of the largest mergers in U.S. corporate history.  Thirty billion dollars... (basking in the glory) When this kind of deal turns up you get on and you ride it `till it's over.  You don't ask it for a vacation... \nA chuckle from the group...the esprit de corps seems to energize Jack. \nJACK (CONT'D) (to the group) December 26th.  After that there'll be so much money floating around here it'll be like Christmas every day... (smiling) December 26th, people.  If you'd like to celebrate that day, you all have my blessing... \nEnthusiastic nods and words of agreement from the suits around the table... \nALAN You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan. \nJACK I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why? \nALAN Why Jack? \nJACK Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end... \nA MURMUR of excitement in the room, even Alan cracks a smile.  Jack puts a hand on Alan's shoulder. \nJACK (CONT'D) Good man... \n12\tINT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThe conference room door opens and the SIX ENERGIZED SUITS emerge, each met by an ASSISTANT handing them messages. \nLASSITER You suddenly having trouble getting dates? \nJACK Not by a long shot. \nLASSITER Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose. \nJack shoots Adelle a satisfied smile, crumpling up Kate's message and tossing a perfect hook into a N.Y. Knicks hoop. \nJACK (to Adelle) I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon. \nADELLE That'll be a nice little holiday treat. \n15\tEXT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT \nA single light remains on in the building. \n16\tINT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME \nJack is alone in the office working on his computer, checking spreadsheets on a large flat screen monitor. \nJack leans back in his chair rubbing his eyes.  He checks his watch.  It's past eleven.  He gets up, goes to the window, sees the city in all its Christmas glory, then he see it... \n...the message from Kate, crumpled in the trashcan...then turns back to the window, gazing out at the night... \n17\tINT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT \nJack comes out of the elevator, walking past the lobby desk where FRANK, a security guard, sits watching the monitors. \nFRANK Mr. Campbell.  Why didn't you call down, I would've had Joe get your ride. \nJack looks outside the front door to the snowy, quiet street. \nJACK I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank. \nFRANK Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home. \nA nod from Jack. \nFRANK (CONT'D) Merry Christmas to you, sir... \nJACK Thanks.  To you too... \nJack puts on a pair of soft leather gloves and heads out into the crisp night air... \n18\tEXT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINOUS \nJack emerges from the building, walking across the large plaza, past the fountain...snow begins to fall... \n19\tEXT. MANHATTAN STREET - A LITTLE LATER \nJack's walking down the nearly empty street, snow falling down on him, a bounce in his step, looking at the windows of the closed shops along the way. \nHe gets to the end of the block spots the Wong Brothers' 24 Hour Deli across the street... \nHe heads toward it... \n20\tINT. WONG BROTHERS' DELI - SECONDS LATER \nJack walks into the brightly lit deli... \nSAM WONG, 20s, is with his 80-year-old GRANDFATHER behind the counter.  There's a NERDY COLLEGE KID at the salad bar, a drunken DEPARTMENT STORE SANTA at the liquor display, a WOMAN with a BABY in an aisle and... \n...a BLACK MAN, 30s, with a dollar sign and the name \"CASH\" tattooed on his arm, stands in front of the coffee machine... \nCASH Oh yeah...yeah, yee-ah!  She's a certified winner...paper- thin but good as gold... \nJack notices Cash talking to himself, seemingly crazy. \nJack approaches Sam Wong at the counter. \nJACK Egg nog? \nSAM WONG (pointing) Dairy case.  Five dollar. \nCASH (in the b.g., to Sam Wong) Y'all do the lotto here...? `Cause I got me a winner...I know, I know, Lotto keeps the black man down... but not me... \nJack grabs a carton of egg nog, then notices Cash handing Sam Wong his ticket.  Jack heads back toward the counter... \nCASH (CONT'D) ...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar... (a smile) Merry Christmas and shit... \nSAM WONG (barely looking at ticket) Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil. \nCASH What're you talkin' about? \nSAM WONG (throwing the ticket back) You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this! \nThe woman with the baby looks over...the college kid looks up, nervous...the drunken Santa, bottle of bourbon in hand, starts to walk by Jack...Jack instinctively puts an arm out, holding the Santa back... \nCASH What!?  Look at the ticket...! \nSAM WONG Get out, I call 911. \nThe Santa looks at Jack, confused. \nCASH You're lookin' at me, you're not even lookin' at the ticket! \nThe woman with the baby puts a loaf of bread back on the shelf, starts nervously inching toward the door. \nSAM WONG You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else. (calling out) Next customer in line...! \nCASH You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making... \nSAM WONG (screaming) Get out! \nJust watching...Cash shoves the ticket in Sam Wong's face... \nCASH LOOK AT THE GODDAMN TICKET!! \nA moment of decision for Jack.  Then... \nJACK (carefully) Let me see that ticket. \nCASH Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all. \nCash looks at Jack.  He smiles and shakes his head. \nJACK Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work... \nCASH (a hearty LAUGH) You still think this is about me, don't you? \nJACK Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too. \nCASH Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself... \nAnd with that, Cash turns and leaves Jack alone on the street with his egg nog... \n22\tINT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT \nJack walks in and throws his keys on a table.  He takes off his gloves and overcoat, glances at the mail, then heads into the bedroom. \nThrough the large windows we see snow falling... \n23\tINT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nJack, flat on his back in bed, fast asleep... \nCHAPTER FOUR - A DIFFERENT LIFE \nDISSOLVE TO: \n24\tINT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING \nClose in on Jack\u0092s face, bathed in morning light...he opens his eyes...feels something strange... \nJack looks down...there\u0092s a woman\u0092s head resting on his chest. \nA look of confusion crosses his face...trying to remember... did he meet a woman last night...? \nHe turns his head to find a large MUTT sitting faithfully beside the bed, wagging his tail... \n...did she have a dog? \nHe looks down at the woman again, craning his neck to get a look at her face.  And then he sees her... \n...KATE REYNOLDS... \n...now 34 and even more beautiful, a look of utter contentment on her radiant face, sleeping soundly... \nHis head darts around the room - it\u0092s cramped and lived in, clothes and toys are strewn about, family photos on the dresser, Laura Ashley curtains, a tiny poster bed and a charming little bay window. \nHe instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch on the night stand, but it\u0092s not there.  It\u0092s a Timex Indiglo and it reads, \u00937:57 A.M...\u0094 \nJack looks back at Kate...he rubs his eyes...maybe it\u0092s a dream...but nothing changes.  Then, Kate stirs... \nKATE Mmmm...ten more minutes, Jack... it\u0092s Christmas... \nJack jumps as he hears Kate talk for the first time... \nSuddenly, the door bursts open...A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL, ANNIE, in a little nightgown, walks into the room carrying an 18 MONTH OLD BOY, JOSH, SINGING at the top of her lungs... \nANNIE Jingle bells, Santa s mells, Rudolph laid an egg...la la la, la-la la la, la la la la la... \nAnnie places Josh on the bed and then jumps up herself.  She gestures to the dog, patting the bed. \nANNIE (CONT\u0092D) You too, Luce... \nThe dog faithfully jumps on the tiny bed, joining everybody else and leaving very little room.  Annie starts jumping. \nANNIE (CONT\u0092D) Rise...and...shine...! \nKATE (stirring) You\u0092re jumping, sweetheart... \nJack looks at this activity like a man at his own funeral. \nANNIE Mom, don\u0092t you think we need to open the presents? \nKATE (groggy) Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present... \nJosh crawls directly up to Jack\u0092s stomach, climbing on. \nANNIE C\u0092mon, Dad.  Get up! \nShe said \u0093Dad.\u0094 \nThat\u0092s it.  Jack moves the baby gingerly over, then gets out of bed, stumbling over a baseball bat lying next to it. \nHe picks up the bat...the same Willie Mays autograph bat that was encased in glass in his N.Y. apartment. \nFrightened, Jack drops the bad, looking down at himself for the first time...he\u0092s naked... \n...a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on the bed... \n...he quickly grabs a pair of sweat pants and a yellow cardigan off the chair and throws them on... \nKate, still half asleep, reaches out her hand. \nKATE Jack...? \nJack turns by instinct.  Kate grabs him, drawing him near.  A look of fear on his face as Kate opens her eyes... \nEye contact...Jack\u0092s certain he\u0092s about to hear her scream... \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) (still groggy) Strong coffee, okay? \nShe lets him go as Jack backs out the door... \n25\tINT. CAMPBELL HOUSE LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER \nA garishly decorated Christmas tree sits in the middle of this messy and disorganized living room, a bevy of gifts underneath and four red stockings over the fireplace. \nJack darts to the top of the steps... \nKATE (O.S.) (calling from the bedroom) Use an entire can if you have to! \nFrustrated, Jack turns and runs back to the mini-van... \nCUT TO: \n30\tEXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MINUTES LATER \nJack pulls up across the street and gets out of the van.  Running across the empty plaza toward the building entrance... \n31\tINT. LASSITER BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nJack bursts through the door, approaching the lobby desk where FRANK the security guard sits. \nFrank spots Jack and blocks his way. \nFRANK Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there... \nJACK Frank.  Where\u0092s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet? \nFRANK Mr. Mintz? (a knowing chuckle) I don\u0092t think so...building\u0092s closed pal.  You\u0092ll have to come back tomorrow. \nJACK Look, I don\u0092t know what\u0092s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company. \nFRANK I don\u0092t care who you are.  It\u0092s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed. \nJACK Maybe you\u0092re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell... (approaching the building directory) Right here.  Jack Campbell, President... \nAnd then he sees it...\u0094ALAN MINTZ - PRESIDENT,\u0094 listed plain as day on the building director... \nJack looks at Frank, then back to the building directory... \nA pitying look from Frank...Jack stands there, in shock... \nCHAPTER FIVE - WHAT\u0092S HAPPENING? \n32\tEXT. LASSITER BUILDING, PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER \n...it\u0092s desolate... \nJack walks through the plaza like a zombie, his face registering nothing.  He crosses the street, moving toward the mini-van...oblivious...when... \nSCREECH...a Ferrari 456M stops within inches of Jack\u0092s torso...a VOICE from the car... \nVOICE (O.S.) Hey!  Watch where you\u0092re walking! \nJack turns...sees the DRIVER low in the seat...can\u0092t quite make out the face... \nVOICE You almost dented my two hundred thousand dollar car! \nJack...still stunned...looks at the car, very familiar...the voice of the driver, also familiar... \nVOICE (CONT\u0092D) That\u0092s right!  My new car\u0092s worth more than your shitty house! \nA look of realization on Jack\u0092s face... \nVOICE (CONT\u0092D) I feel like I really did win the lottery! \n...it\u0092s Cash, and he\u0092s in Jack\u0092s car... \nJack moves over to the passenger window in shock...a smile from Cash... \nCASH Miss me, Jack? \nJACK That\u0092s my car!  You stole my car! \nCASH It\u0092s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract... \nJACK What?! \nCASH Basically, it\u0092s my car now.  Get in. \nCash reaches over and opens the door.  Jack hesitates... \nCASH (CONT\u0092D) Look, I don\u0092t make the rules, Jack.  This is how it works.  Get in. \nCash gives him a reassuring look.  Jack gets in... \n33\tINT. FERRARI - CONTINUOUS \nJack closes the door...Cash joyfully drives off in a burst of acceleration...Jack practically ends up in the back seat... \nCASH Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack... \nJACK (recovering) What the hell is happening to me?! \nJack\u0092s freaking out and Cash is enjoying every minute of it.  Cash hands Jack a paper bag.  Jack starts breathing into the bag. \nCASH This kinda thing makes a lotta guys throw up. Seen it happen.  So if you get the urge, do it out the window. (with a taunting laugh) I don\u0092t want you marring this exquisite leather interior... \nCash looks over at Jack...he\u0092s really losing it, sobbing into the bag...almost hyperventilating...Cash smiles... \nCASH (CONT\u0092D) Look, I don\u0092t know what you\u0092re getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself. \nJACK Brought what on myself?! I didn\u0092t do anything! \nCASH No?  C\u0092mon, Jack...I\u0092ve got everything I need, I don\u0092t have regrets, that\u0092s just not for me... sound familiar? \nJACK You mean because you thought I was cocky I\u0092m now on a permanent acid trip?!! \nCash gets a laugh out of Jack\u0092s overreaction... \nCASH Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  You\u0092re making a business deal... \nJACK (enraged) Give me my goddamn life back! \nCASH You?  What about me?  I\u0092m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved... \nJACK (interrupting) Please.  Just tell me what\u0092s happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo... \nCash turns to Jack. \nCASH It\u0092s a glimpse, Jacko. \nARNIE You and me, buddy.  We know how to live... \nArnie shepherds Jack onto a bar stool and pours a drink out of a bamboo bottle holder. \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) So Jack, you okay? \nJack doesn\u0092t respond, his eyes drawn to a softball team photo on the bar...Jack and Arnie kissing a huge trophy with the caption, \u0093Plainfield, N.J. Softball League Champs, 1994.\u0094 \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) I mean you leave the house on Christmas morning, you don\u0092t tell anyone where you\u0092re going... \nJack looks over from the photo to Arnie... \nJACK We\u0092re friends, aren\u0092t we? \nARNIE Maybe I don\u0092t say it enough but you moving in next door to me... \nArnie makes a fist and gestures to his heart.  Jack nods. \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) Talk to me... \nA moment of decision for Jack as Arnie stands there, open eyed, ready to listen. \nJACK I\u0092m having kind of a bad day. \nARNIE (nodding) I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays... \nA raised eyebrow from Jack. \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) (to himself) What am I saying?  You don\u0092t need to hear that... (back to Jack) All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that\u0092s all.  Is that you? \nJACK Is it...? \nARNIE Trouble at work? \nJACK I don\u0092t think so. \nARNIE It\u0092s not Kate, is it? \nJack pauses at the mention of Kate.  Arnie\u0092s eyes widen... \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) (proudly) You see, it\u0092s like we\u0092re in each other\u0092s heads... \nJACK Kate\u0092s my wife... \nJack looks at Arnie as if he\u0092s seeking confirmation. \nARNIE (a playful smile) Just keep saying it, Jack, like a mantra. \nArnie comes out from behind the bar, taking Jack by the arm. \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) C\u0092mon, I better walk ya home.  She\u0092s mad enough as it is, right...? \n37\tEXT. ARNIE\u0092S YARD - SECONDS LATER \nArnie walks Jack through his backyard... \nARNIE Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn\u0092t the life I dreamt about.  Where\u0092s the romance, where\u0092s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can\u0092t have... \nJACK (thinking, then...) It\u0092s just two kids, right? \nA chuckle from Arnie. \nARNIE You made a choice, Jack, a promise to your wife. Maybe sometimes it seems like you gave up the world, but look what you got... \nThey arrive at...the backyard of the Campbell house... cluttered with a swing set, a dog run with chewed up lawn, and a wooden sun deck in the process of being built... \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) Four bedrooms, two and a half baths, and a partially finished basement... \nJack trips over a wayward BIG WHEEL. \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) (shaking his head) Kids... \nArnie leads Jack toward the house. \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) Okay look, you probably don\u0092t want to hear this right now but remember what you told me last summer when I almost had that thing with Arnie Jr.\u0092s speech therapist. \nA blank stare from Jack as they arrive at the sliding glass door...Arnie faces Jack squarely, grabbing his shoulders and looking him in the eye. \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) Don\u0092t screw up the best thing in your life just because you\u0092re a little unsure about who you are.  Okay? \nArnie gives Jack a comforting smie... \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) God, it feels so good to finally give something back to you... \nArnie turns Jack toward the door and slides it open. \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) I\u0092m gonna hug you now... \nArnie gives Jack a gentle hug...then gives him a little push toward the door... \n38\tINT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, DEN - CONTINUOUS \nJack steps inside.  He turns back to the door but Arnie\u0092s gone. \nThen, Kate enters the room, holding a portable phone... \nKATE (into phone) Hold on a second... \nShe cups the receiver.  Jack looks at her, she\u0092s dressed now, nothing fancy but she looks great. \nJACK You cut your hair... \nA curious look from Kate. \nKATE Ten years ago... \nKate just stands there looking at Jack, giving away nothing. \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) Are you okay? \nJACK Yeah...fine. \n...none of this stuff is his... \n...he looks in the mirror again, his face revealing a forlorn sense of displacement... \n...he stares at himself until...he starts to lose it... anger, confusion...sadness...finally, he begins breaking down... \nAfter a moment, he turns on the water, rinsing his face... \n40\tINT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, BEDROOM CLOSET - MINUTES LATER \nJack at the closet door, looking at a row of Hagar slacks, Docker sport coats and imitation leather shoes... \nHe reaches in and touches the fabric on one of the sport coats. \nJACK This is just... (searching for the words) ...this is sub-par... \nAnnie appears at the bedroom door, watching Jack at the closet. \nHe turns...sees Annie watching him...a look exchanged... then, Annie runs away... \nJack turns back to the closet and mournfully takes a pair of the slacks... \n41\tEXT. THOMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT \nJack and Kate, a casserole dish in her hand, walk up the path to this tacky but large house, its outside decorated with the most garish display of Christmas decorations this side of Pasaic. \nKate RINGS the doorbell... \nEVELYN THOMPSON, 30s, wearing a dress that\u0092s a bit too tight and a bit too low cut, opens the door... \nEVELYN Kate!  Jack! (turning around, to guests) Everybody, Jack and Kate are here! \nJack looks right past her...to the house filled with 50 GUESTS. \nA loud WHOOP from the guests...Jack has the look of a condemned man on his face as he follows Kate inside... \n41A\tINT. THOMPSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nAs Kate heads into the living room, Evelyn takes Jack\u0092s arm... \nEVELYN (suggestively) Like the dress...? \nJACK (glancing at it) It\u0092s lovely... \nEVELYN (a satisfied smile) I thought I saw you notice it at the kids\u0092 recital. \nJack shoots her a confused look...then walks in, trying to catch up with Kate... \n42\tINT. THOMPSON HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER \nThe party is in full swing, Christmas music in the b.g., GUESTS talking, laughing, drinking egg nog... \nJack\u0092s eyes dart around the room...it\u0092s large, neater than his and Kate\u0092s house but still very lived in...The Thompson KIDS run in and out of the room, playing with new toys... nobody is wearing or eating anything imported from Europe, but everyone\u0092s having a good time... \n...everyone except for Jack, standing with Arnie and THE GUYS, having his ear chewed off by NICK CARELLI, a walking advertisement for Levi\u0092s Cotton Dockers... \nNICK Did you see Van Horn last night?  This kid\u0092s gonna single-handedly save basketball in the state of New Jersey... \nJACK The Nets?  You\u0092re kidding, right...? \nNick looks at him in disbelief. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) (recovering) Well...they\u0092re certainly due. \nBILL KRAMER, a huge pile of fried chicken wings on his plate, tugs at Jack\u0092s shirt. \nBILL KRAMER So tomorrow\u0092s the big day, Jackie... \nJACK Okay...why? \nBILL KRAMER Triple bypass.  I\u0092m going under the knife.  I told you, didn\u0092t I? \nJACK Triple bypass? (pointing to his plate) You really think you should be eating all that? \nBILL KRAMER Why not?  I figure I\u0092m going in for a cleaning tomorrow, I might as well load up on the fried stuff tonight... \nARNIE Good thinking, Bill. Have another drink. (whispering to Jack) He\u0092ll be lucky if he lives through the night... \nNick reaches into his pocket and pulls out a packet of Dutch Masters cigars.  He shows them to Jack, Jack nods politely.  Nick eagerly hands him one... \nNick lights Jack\u0092s cigar, then his own...enjoying that first puff...smiling at Jack...Jack dutifully takes a puff of the cigar...nods back at Nick...but it\u0092s an effort... \nEvelyn Thompson approaches, a tray of MUSHROOM PUFFS in hand... \nEVELYN (holding out a puff to Jack) Finger food...? \nJACK I don\u0092t think so, thank you... \nEVELYN (suggestively) C\u0092mon, as soon as I put them down, you\u0092re gonna grab a couple...you always do... \nKate sees Evelyn and Jack from her position on the other side of the room...Kate watches as... \nEvelyn holds the puff up to Jack\u0092s mouth, slowly putting it near his lips... \nEVELYN (CONT\u0092D) Let me.  They\u0092ll melt in your mouth... \nHe instinctively opens his mouth as Evelyn pushes the treat inside... \nEVELYN (CONT\u0092D) Good? \nOn Jack\u0092s face...if freezer burn were a facial expression, this would be it... \nJACK (forcing a smile) They\u0092re great!  Thank you! \n...Evelyn licks her fingers suggestively then hands Jack the entire tray with a sexy smile... \nA raised eyebrow from Kate, still watching... \nEVELYN Mushroom puffs aren\u0092t the only thing I do well... \nJACK Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me... \nLucy\u0092s sniffing around someone\u0092s Christmas display but Jack\u0092s too wrapped up in his thought process to notice. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Triage.  It\u0092s your signature.  You survey the damage, find out everything you can, you probe, leave nothing to chance.  I\u0092m just gonna have to go detective. How did you get Mentadent?  You learned everything there was to know about toothpaste and then you pounced... \nJack narrows his eyes, thinking about that deal... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) That\u0092s our play here... \nResolute, Jack turns to the dog. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) If you could take a dump some time in this century, then we could go home where it\u0092s warm... \nJack looks around at the unfamiliar houses... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) That is if I can even remember how to get home... (to Lucy) You remember, don\u0092t you girl? \nBut the dog ignores him, dragging Jack along... \n47\tINT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nKate is in bed, fast asleep. \nJack walks into the room, his face still red from the cold outside.  He looks over at Kate, sleeping happily. \nHe takes off his shirt and khakis, laying them neatly on the chair.  He looks over at the pair of flannel pajamas folded on the dresser.  He shakes his head, resigned, then dons the pajamas and climbs into bed... \nCHAPTER SIX - BEING A PARENT 48\tINT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING \nMorning light streams into the room.  The clock reads, \nJack opens his eyes \u0096 a burst of light hitting them from the window...like the morning light in his Manhattan loft... \nHe reaches across the bed...it\u0092s empty... \nA smile of hope from Jack as he puts his head back on the pillow...maybe it was only a day...Then... \nThe sound of a baby CRYING from the next room...A pained look on Jack\u0092s face as he realizes he\u0092s still in Jersey. \nNow the baby is WAILING...Jack lies still a moment, hoping it\u0092ll stop...it doesn\u0092t.  Then, he hears the sound of the SHOWER TURN ON in the bathroom. \nHe gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom... \n49\tINT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe shower is running, a tape player is BLASTING \u0093Beast of Burden.\u0094  Kate is in the shower SINGING LOUDLY with the song... \nJACK Hello? \nNo answer... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) (louder, over music) Hello! \nKATE (singing) ...my feet are hurtin\u0092... \nJACK (yelling) HEY! \nFinally, the music is turned down and Kate pulls the shower curtain open... \nJack sees her naked body...raises an eyebrow...that\u0092s something he\u0092s missed...then... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Uh...that baby\u0092s crying... \nKATE (unimpressed) And...? \n...her expression makes Jack turn his gaze from her naked body. \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) Don\u0092t give me that look, Jack, Tuesday\u0092s your day and you know it.  And try to get Josh to day care on time, okay?  He missed the macaroni painting last week... \nShe closes the curtain and turns the radio back up. \nCUT TO: \n50\tINT. JOSH\u0092S ROOM - MORNING \nAnnie\u0092s watching from a baby-size Laz-E-Boy lounger as... \nJack, in a robe, stands in front of a changing table, Josh laying happily on his back, playing with a set of plastic keys. \nJack takes a fresh Huggies diaper and puts it next to the baby.  He surveys Josh, scratching his chin and rubbing his hands like Indiana Jones.  Josh playfully grabs at Jack\u0092s nose. \nHe looks over to Annie.  She\u0092s still staring at him like he\u0092s a Martian.  He looks at the instructions on the box of Huggies. \nJACK Pull tape... \nJack searches the diaper for the tabs of tape, then gingerly pulls them apart, releasing the diaper from the baby\u0092s bottom, and seeing what\u0092s inside. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Holy mother of god! \nJack holds the diaper out away from him, searching for a place to put it.  Annie points to a Diaper Genie by the dresser. \nJack throws the diaper in, then quickly replaces the lid.  Annie points to the container of Baby Wipes. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) You must be kidding... \nAnnie stares at him a beat.  Then... \nANNIE You\u0092re not really our dad, are you? \nJack turns to her.  She\u0092s looking back at him with complete earnestness.  They stare at each other another moment.  Then... \nJACK No, I\u0092m not. \nA look of curiosity from Annie. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) I work on Wall Street, you know with the big buildings...? \nNo response from Annie... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) I live in an apartment house with a doorman, I can buy just about anything I want... \nAnnie nods at Jack, still suspicious. \nJACK Good Lord... \n...a huge, three-story-tall plastic likeness of Big Ed Reynolds, ten gallon hat, lassoing a tire... \n55\tEXT. BIG ED\u0092S TIRES - MOMENTS LATER \nJack approaches Big Ed\u0092s from the parking lot...slowly, taking it all in... \nIt\u0092s like a Pep Boys with a Texas theme.  A big retail store for tires and auto parts, and a repair bay for everything from alignments to brake jobs... \nJack walks to the tire bay where HECTOR, 40s, a Guatemalan mechanic in grease-stained coveralls, stands with TOMMY the salesman. \nTOMMY Hey Jack, you happen to know the stock number on those new Michelin X1's? \nJACK Uh...lemme get back to you on that one... (looking at his name tag) Tommy... \nHECTOR (to Tommy) Thomas, why you bother Jack about that.  Look it up yourself... (to Jack) Okay Jack, we talk later... \nJack nods amiably then continues into the store... \n56\tINT. BIG ED\u0092S TIRES - CONTINUOUS \nJack walks in...looks around...the store is teeming with activity, a post-holiday sale in progress... \nBig Ed, in his signature ten gallon hat, sees Jack from behind the counter... \nBIG ED Jack my boy!  You are looking mighty worse for the wear...Hey, guess who I played bridge with two nights ago...? \nJack stares blankly at Big Ed... \nBIG ED (CONT\u0092D) Hell, you\u0092ll never guess.  One Sydney Potter.  That\u0092s Sydney Potter, Chief Executive Officer of BuyRite Transport.  Only the third largest trucking company in the state.  I even let the sonuvabitch win, which wasn\u0092t easy because the guy\u0092s been bashed in the head by Teamsters so many times his brain\u0092s like porridge.  Anyhoo, he\u0092s looking for a new parts supplier... we can handle that kind of volume, right? \nJack considers this briefly. \nJACK I\u0092m gonna have to get back to you on that...Ed. \nBig Ed makes a gun gesture with his forefinger, winking at Jack, then turns back to the activity at the counter as... \nJack spots KENNY, a very young sales associate, walking by.  He reaches out and taps Kenny on the shoulder. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Do I have a private office somewhere in the building? \nKENNY Uh...sure Jack... (nervously pointing) Right back there... \nJACK Thank you. \nJack walks into the office with his name on the door... \n57\tINT. JACK\u0092S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nThere\u0092s no Stairmaster here, no leather sofa or bar...it\u0092s small, cramped and cluttered, the walls littered with tire inventory and price lists... \nJack takes a slow, sad lap around the office. \nHe makes it to the small wooden desk at the far end of the room and sits down behind it... \nOn the desk are photos of Jack, Kate and the kids, a plastic Michelin Man model, a tire-themed day calendar and a small plastic figurine of a BOWLER, the word, \u0093Bowlers Do It In An Alley\u0094 embossed on its base... \nHe surveys the desktop briefly, then opens the top drawer, finding a personal checkbook and looking inside... \nHe sees the bottom line and winces, then puts it back... \nJack picks up the \u0093Bowlers Do It In An Alley\u0094 figurine and gives it a good look... \nJACK Bowlers do it in an alley?...Non profit lawyers do it for free... what is it with these people?  Don\u0092t they realize this refers to sex? \nHe replaces the figurine then opens the bottom drawer where he spots a bottle of Glenfiddich.  He lifts it out... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) At least you splurged on some decent scotch... \nHe takes a paper cup and pours himself a shot.  He drinks it down in one gulp and then crumples up the cup, throwing it toward the NET\u0092S basketball hoop/garbage can near the door. \nHe misses... \nHe looks more closely at the photographs...most are family photos, a happy Jack with Kate, with Annie at the pony rides, at Josh\u0092s birth...in every one of them, Jack is smiling... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) (to Jack in the photo) What are you smiling about...? \nHe turns his head...spots a small plaque on the wall behind him.  It reads, \u0093Jack Campbell - E.F. Hutton #1 Junior Sales Associate, 1988.\u0094  Jack raises an eyebrow... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Number one...not bad. \nHe grabs it off the wall and looks at it more carefully... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) \n1988...?  I was in London in 1988... \nJack\u0092s jarred into reality... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) (to Jack in the photo) You never went to London... (picking up the photo) ...you never got on that plane... \nHe stays there a moment...in shock.  Then... \nThe P.A. system comes to life... \nESTELLE (over P.A.) Jack to mag wheels...Jack, you\u0092re needed in mag wheels, customer waiting! \nCUT TO: \n58\tINT. BIG ED\u0092S TIRES, MAIN FLOOR - MINUTES LATER \nKenny leading Jack toward the \u0093Mag Wheels\u0094 section. \nJACK ...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that? \nKENNY No, I didn\u0092t...that\u0092s great. \nJACK That\u0092s the kind of thing you can really build on... \nKENNY Uh huh... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) You want to bid hearts, we\u0092re right there with you.  You feel the need to redouble, you\u0092re not going to get any argument from us... \nPotter nods at Jack.  Jack moves in for the kill. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) The big guys may have the high cards, but you know as well as I do, Sydney, high cards don\u0092t always take the trick. \nPotter pauses a minute, then... \nPOTTER (to Big Ed, re: Jack) I like him... \nBig Ed smiles, letting out a relieved sigh. \nBIG ED (a wink to Jack) That\u0092s my boy... (an arm around Potter) C\u0092mon, lemme show you the rest of the ranch... \nBig Ed and Potter exit the office... \nBIG ED (CONT\u0092D) (turning back to Jack) Nice shootin\u0092, Jack... \n...leaving Jack there with a satisfied smile on his face. \n60\tINT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJack is in bed watching CNBC...On the TV a young woman REPORTER at the anchor\u0092s desk... \nCNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.) ...advancers led decliners by a nine to four ratio and the closing tick was a mildly bullish plus seventy six.  Much of the market\u0092s action today was fueled by the latest round of merger mania to hit Wall Street... \nThe Global Health Systems and MedTech logos appear on a graphic in the corner of the screen... \nCNBC REPORTER (CONT\u0092D, ON T.V.) ...when Global Health Systems and MedTech Pharmaceutical announced their intentions to join forces in a massive one hundred and twenty two billion dollar stock swap deal.  Though neither side expressed significant regulatory concerns at the announcement press conference, it is believed that both the FDA and the FTC will be closely scrutinizing the marriage, the largest ever in the health care industry.  When asked about possible anti- competitive implications, Global Chairman Bob Thomas referred reporters to P.K. Lassiter and Company President Alan Mintz, the original architect behind the deal... \nJack stares in shock as the image changes to a super confident looking Mintz shaking Bob Thomas\u0092 hand at the press conference. \nCNBC REPORTER (CONT\u0092D, ON T.V.) Ironically, Mintz first met Thomas at a Lamaze class... \nJACK A Lamaze class...!? \nCNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.) ...while coaching their pregnant wives, Mintz and T homas struck up a dialogue about the need for consolidation in the rapidly growing health care industry and two months later, the deal with MedTech was born... \nJACK What?!  That\u0092s my deal? \nCNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.) In other business news, U.S. Labor Department officials announced today that two hundred and seventy-five thousand new jobs were created last month, twenty-five thousand less than economists were predicting, leading to a mild rally in the bond markets before midday. But as the trading session drew to a close, the profit takers stepped in and the long bond closed at ninety seven even, up only two ticks, the yield inching down to six point zero seven percent... \nKate comes into the room from the hallway wearing only Jack\u0092s NYU sweatshirt... \nKATE The kids are asleep... \nShe goes over to the window and draws the blinds.  Jack looks up at her, nods, then goes back to the TV. \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) Jack.  I said the kids are asleep... \nJACK (distracted) Well that\u0092s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful... \nKate shuts off the TV. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Hey!  I was watching that! \nKATE I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed. \nJACK I\u0092m working on a new deal now... \nKate throws a Kate Bush\u0092s \u0093The Sensual World\u0094 into the CD player. \nKATE Fine, but not tonight... \nShe climbs onto the bed, a seductive look on her face. \nJACK Wait a second.  You want me, don\u0092t you? \nKATE That is the general idea, yes... \nKate starts kissing him...but Jack\u0092s a little uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy...he pulls back, a little nervous. \nJACK Shouldn\u0092t we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...? \nKATE It\u0092s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you\u0092re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don\u0092t have time for wining and dining. \nJACK Whatever you say...honey. \nShe starts kissing him again...but this time he just goes with it, and as her hands run through his hair he\u0092s brought back to a different time and place... \nJack momentarily pulls back and looks at her...it\u0092s like the first time he\u0092s really looked at her in eleven years... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) God...you\u0092re beautiful... \nShe smiles at him, almost uncomfortable with the compliment... \nKATE Thanks, Jack... \nJACK No, I\u0092m serious...you\u0092re really stunning... \nKATE This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming... \nJACK I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, there\u0092s no question about that.  But this... (lost in her) ...you\u0092ve really grown into a beautiful woman... \nJack stares at her, entranced...Kate pulls back, reacting to the intensity in his stare... \nKATE How can you do that? \nJACK (nervous) Do what? \nKATE Look at me like you haven\u0092t seen me every day for the last twelve years... \nJack freezes.  There\u0092s love in her eyes but it\u0092s not meant for him... \nShe kisses him... \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) Don\u0092t move. \nShe gets up off the bed and heads for the bathroom... \nHe looks around...not sure what to do...Finally... \nKATE Maybe you\u0092re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn\u0092t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that\u0092s what it\u0092s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids\u0092 college fund. \nThey stare at each other for a moment...a stand-off... \nJACK Forget it... (taking off the jacket) We\u0092ll get a funnel cake. It\u0092ll be the highlight of my week... \n64\tEXT. NEW JERSEY ROAD - NIGHT \nThe blue mini-van makes its way down this road... \n65\tINT. MINI-VAN - NIGHT \nThere\u0092s an icy silence in the car...Jack is behind the wheel, Kate next to him looking out the window, anger on her face... \nCHAPTER NINE - REMINISCING \nJack checks the rear-view mirror, sees Annie and Josh in the back, both asleep... \nJACK (to Kate) Listen, I\u0092m sorry about that back in the store. I really don\u0092t want to fight with you... \nKate just keeps looking out the window. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) But you must sometimes wonder how we ended up here.  I mean back in college, did you see us... (looking around) ...here...? \nShe turns to him. \nKATE I\u0092ll give you this, life has thrown us a few surprises... \nA glimmer in Jack\u0092s eye... \nJACK It really has, hasn\u0092t it?  So if you had to...what would you say was the biggest surprise? \nShe glances at the kids sleeping in the back. \nKATE Well...Annie for one. \nJACK Surprise.  We\u0092re pregnant... (a laugh) Yeah...that must\u0092ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right? \nKATE I think it worked out okay, don\u0092t you? \nJACK Sure.  I really like Annie. \nKATE Good, Jack.  Maybe we\u0092ll keep her. \nJACK No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn\u0092t we? \nKATE We were young... (a nostalgic smile) Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to? \nJACK Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...? (off her nod) Great times.  Why\u0092d we ever leave? \nKATE You can\u0092t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village... \nJack nods, starting to piece it together. \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) The trek out to the hospital every day didn\u0092t help either... (looking at him) You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing... \nJACK You had a heart attack? \nKATE (a laugh) Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you... (a sigh) ...who knows what would\u0092ve happened if you hadn\u0092t stepped in at the store. \nJACK That\u0092s why I work for Big Ed? \nA look from Kate. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) (recovering) I mean, that\u0092s why I work for Big Ed... \nJack looks out at the road a moment, piecing it all together in his mind. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) (almost to himself) So we had a baby, Big Ed had a heart attack, we b ought that house, and I\u0092ve been working for him ever since...Sayonara, Wall Street. \nKate looks at him a little strangely. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) (turning to her) Our life in a nutshell... \nKATE If you want to look at it that way... \nJACK How would you look at it? \nShe glances again at the kids in the back seat, then at Jack. \nKATE A great success story... \nA smile from Jack.

BOWLING ALLEY - EVENING \nA crowded suburban New Jersey bowling alley... \nJack stands at a lane holding a bowling ball, the nickname \u0093The Hammer\u0094 emblazoned over his bowling shirt pocket...He approaches the line and throws the ball down the lane... \nIt\u0092s ugly...The ball caroms off the hardwood into the gutter. \nJACK Damn... \nARNIE (O.S., from behind) Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god\u0092s sake! \nJack turns.  Arnie and the BOWLING TEAM are in the scorekeeping area watching Jack make a mockery of the sport.  Jack scowls. \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) Where\u0092s your follow through?  Where\u0092s your stance? \nJACK Hey, I\u0092m doing the best I can... (under his breath) I\u0092d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers... \nARNIE You\u0092re right.  Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare... \nJack retrieves his ball, sets up, genuinely concentrating... \nJACK (quietly, to himself) You are Jack Campbell. You\u0092re better than this sport.  You shot the rapids at Kenai.  You ran with the bulls at Pamplona.  You jumped out of a plane over the Mojave Desert, for Christ\u0092s sake.  You can do this... \nJack puts everything he has into the throw, heaving the ball down the lane with as much grace and power as he can muster...hitting the six pin and taking out four others. \nJack and Kate exchange a sexy smile... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) It\u0092s such an ancient pitch, but one that I\u0092d never switch... \nJack kisses her on the lips...HOOTS and HOLLERS from the crowd. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) \u0091Cause there\u0092s no nicer witch than you... \nKate brushes a hand across Jack\u0092s face... \nSmash cut to Jack watching this...seeing the connection, the heat between them...coveting it... \nBack to the video...the music building...the crowd completely in the palm of Jack\u0092s hand... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) ...than you... \nThe camera closes in on Jack and Kate as the music builds to a crescendo... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) ...than you... \nA little musical flourish from Bill as the crowd breaks out into huge CHEERS and APPLAUSE... \nJack, watching this other version of himself in the video, the center of attention, larger than life, focused on Kate... \nBack on video... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) (speaking quietly to Kate) Happy Birthday sweetheart...I love you. \nKate leans over, giving Jack a deep kiss...OOHS and AHHS from the crowd...but Jack and Kate are in their own little world... \nJack continues to watch himself on the video, his smile fading, becoming a look of realization...then loss... \nA tear at the corner of his eye... \nThe SOUND fades in Jack\u0092s head as the action in the video continues... \nHe\u0092s left standing there...silent, still... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n72\tINT.

Kate pushes the button to stop it. \nKATE (groggy) Time to get up, honey... \nJack obliges without question, getting out of bed, putting on a robe and slippers and exiting, still practically half-asleep. \n73\tINT. KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER \nJack walks into the kitchen. \nHe turns on the Mr. Coffee, gets a bottle from the fridge, throws it in the microwave, removes it, and heads upstairs. \n74\tINT. JOSH\u0092S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \n...into Josh\u0092s room.  Josh is wide awake, standing up in his crib, like a prisoner in a cell. \nJack gives him the bottle, pats his head perfunctorily, and then walks out of the room... \nCHAPTER TWELVE - HAPPY ANNIVERSARY \n75\tINT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \n...and back into the bedroom to find Kate, sitting on the bed, a wrapped present in front of her and a wide smile on her face. \nJack stops, raising an eyebrow at the gift.  He looks behind, as if to ask whether it\u0092s for him, then back to Kate. \nKATE Happy Anniversary, honey... \nTerror on Jack\u0092s face. \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) (pushing the gift forward) Before you do whatever crazy stunt you\u0092ve got planned I want you to open mine... \nJack musters up a smile, then approaches the gift. \nJACK Maybe I should wait... \nKATE No, open it... \nHe hesitates, then begins unwrapping the package, revealing... \n...a suit, similar in color and style to the Zegna suit... \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) I found it at an outlet store.  I know it\u0092s a knock-off, but I think it\u0092ll look great on you... \nJACK (examining the label) Zeena... \nJack is overcome with emotion...Yes, it\u0092s a ZEENA, but this is probably the nicest thing anyone\u0092s ever done for him... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) (tearing up) You really are incredible... \nKATE Enjoy it, sweetheart... \nJack looks at Kate\u0092s expectant face, suddenly remembering how truly screwed he is. \nJACK You\u0092re probably expecting something from me... \nHe\u0092s sweating bullets...watching as Kate gets a quizzical look on her face... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Here\u0092s the thing.  I really hadn\u0092t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight. (an uncomfortable smile) You know, anniversary\u0092s good all day... \nKATE What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it\u0092s light out. \nJACK I know that, but... \nBeat.  Kate looks at him like she\u0092s looking into his soul. \nKATE You forgot. \nKate rubs her lips together, showing Annie how to do it.  Annie mimics her Mom, then Kate looks at her \u0096 Annie\u0092s beaming. \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) You\u0092re gonna break a lot of hearts, you know. \nA smile from Annie... \nPull back to reveal...Jack standing at the door, watching ...appreciating the kind of mother Kate is... \n79   OMITTED \n80\tEXT. LOIRE - NIGHT \nA small, elegant French restaurant hidden on a tree- lined lower Manhattan street. \n81\tINT. LOIRE - SAME TIME \nJack is wearing the suit Kate gave him.  It\u0092s not a Zegna, but he looks pretty damn good. \nHe leads Kate toward the cloak room at this intimate restaurant... \nHe helps her off with her coat.  Kate\u0092s wearing the sexy little black dress and we can immediately see its effectiveness... \nJACK You look beautiful... \nA charmed smile from Kate as she hands Jack her coat. \nJack hands the coats over to the COAT CHECK GIRL... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) (instinctively) Thanks, Catherine... \nJack fakes a SNEEZE, trying to cover up...Kate gives him a pat on the back... \nKATE You okay? \nHe takes Kate by the arm... \nJACK Fine... \nHe leads her to the main room. \nShe looks out at the room, elegant tables, French country decor, a PIANIST playing Cole Porter... \nKATE (quietly to Jack) Jack...can we afford all this? \nJACK What\u0092s the difference? I\u0092m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs... \nKATE How do you even know about this place? \nJack\u0092s caught for a moment.  Then... \nJACK Arnie... (insistent) Arnie.  He\u0092ll throw you a curve ball once in a while, that\u0092s for sure... \nJack puts his arm around her and kisses her on the cheek... \n82\tINT. LOIRE - A LITTLE LATER \nJack and Kate sit at a secluded table, a WAITER standing next to them.  Jack\u0092s not even looking at the menu. \nJACK We\u0092ll have the tureen of quail breast with shiitake mushrooms to start, then the veal medallions in raspberry truffle sauce and the sea scallops with pureed artichoke hearts...sea scallops, North of the Caspian... \nKate looks at Jack, a mixture of confusion and awe on her face. \nWAITER Very good, sir.  And may I say those are all excellent selections. \nJACK You may... (perusing the wine list) Also, we\u0092ll have a bottle of Lafite, 1982. \nKate reaches over and pulls down the wine list, reading it upside down. \nKATE It\u0092s five hundred and fifty dollars, Jack! \nA wince from Jack...for a moment there it was almost perfect. \nJACK Just a glass of red wine for each of us... \nThe waiter nods, then walks toward the kitchen... \nKATE You are so not off the hook yet, slick. \nJACK But I\u0092m gettin\u0092 close, right? \nA noncommittal nod from Kate.  Then Jack notices her look over at the pianist, drawn in by the music. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) You want to dance? \nA puzzled look from Kate.  There\u0092s nobody else dancing.  There isn\u0092t even much room to dance... \nKATE I don\u0092t think there\u0092s dancing here, Jack. \nJack gets up and holds out a hand. \nJACK Sure there is... \nKate looks around again, then she smiles. \nKate rises, taking his hand.  Jack takes her in his arms, swaying slowly in the limited amount of space, confident and self-assured. \nThe pianist looks up, smiling, appreciating their role in this romantic moment. \nKate moves with Jack, following his lead comfortably. They look good together...in sync with each other... \nPeople are watching them...some of the men are impressed, others are scoffing, but the women are clearly charmed... \nKATE (whispering to Jack) Pretty good for a tire salesman from Jersey... \nJack flashes her his most charming smile. \nJACK I have my moments... \nThey continue to dance, in a world of their own... \n83\tINT. LOIRE - LATE \nCHAPTER FOURTEEN - A PERFECT LIFE? \nCUT TO: \n101\tINT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - DAY \nA double door opens and Jack leads Kate into this huge duplex.  Kate looks around, taking the place in. \nJACK Welcome to Xanadu... \nThe place is incredible...marble floors, architectural lines, high tech fixtures, elegant modern furniture... it\u0092s striking but not at all homey like the Jersey house. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Pretty incredible, isn\u0092t it? \nKATE It\u0092s like a museum. \nJack nods. \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) (turning to Jack) So what\u0092s the big surprise? You didn\u0092t rent this place for the weekend, did you? \nJACK Think bigger. \nKATE For the week? \nJack chuckles. \nJACK This place is a perk, Kate. \nKATE A perk for what? \nJACK A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives... \nKate\u0092s confused. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) You\u0092re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions. \nKATE What are you talking about, Jack? \nJACK I\u0092m going into arbitrage, honey.  Turns out I have a knack for it.  I\u0092ll be making two hundred grand a year plus a hefty bonus and that\u0092s just to start.  And, we can live in this apartment practically rent free for as long as we want. \nJack measures her reaction. It\u0092s not good... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) We can finally afford to move back into the city. In style. \nKate just looks at him, in shock. Then... \nKATE Are you out of your mind? \nJACK I don\u0092t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We\u0092ll put Annie and Josh in private schools... \nKATE Annie goes to a great school. \nJACK I\u0092m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate... \nKATE Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job? \nJACK This is New York City, it\u0092s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren\u0092t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here... \nKATE (cutting him off) I can\u0092t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn\u0092t want to raise the kids here? \nJACK No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon. \nKATE (cutting him off) Jack. \nJack\u0092s starting to struggle... \nJACK Look, I\u0092m detecting a kind of funky tension here...We don\u0092t have to live in this apartment. I don\u0092t need this...I\u0092ll commute...I\u0092ll drive to work... \nJack\u0092s back on his heels...seeing his dream picked apart... \nKATE In traffic?  It\u0092s over an hour each way?  That\u0092s almost three hours a day.  When are you going to see the kids? \nHe\u0092s frustrated...he pauses a moment to gather himself. Then... \nJACK Kate. You\u0092re not understanding me. I\u0092m talking about a great life.  A perfect life. Everything we pictured when we were young. The whole package. You said it yourself, life has thrown us surprises, and so we made sacrifices. But now I can finally get us back on track... \nA sad chuckle from Kate. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man... (imploring her) Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow... \nKATE Then get a goddamn snow blower! \nJack\u0092s taken aback by the intensity of her tone. \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) Don\u0092t get a new career without even telling me. Don\u0092t take Annie out of a school she loves.  Don\u0092t move us out of a house we\u0092ve become a family in... \nKate stands there, wounded... \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) (quietly) Don\u0092t do that... \nJACK Look, you\u0092re making this into something it\u0092s not. This isn\u0092t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It\u0092s a step forward... (appealing to her) Don\u0092t you see?  I\u0092m talking about us finally having a life other people envy. \nSilence.  Kate looks him in the eye \u0096 a deep, piercing look... \nKATE They already do envy us, Jack... \nKate picks up her bag and walks out of the apartment. \n102  OMITTED \n103\tINT. ANNIE\u0092S ROOM - NIGHT \nAnnie is in a nightgown, practicing her violin. Jack walks in. \nIt\u0092s all he can do to hold back cringing at the missed notes. Annie finishes the piece, lowering the bow. \nJACK Very nice. What is it? \nANNIE Mary Had A Little Lamb. \nJACK Ah. A classic... \nHe turns and sees Annie at the open garage door, sitting on her bike, ringing the BELL. \nIt\u0092s an eerie moment for Jack... \nJACK What are you doing? \nANNIE (a curious look) Ringing my bell... \nOn Jack\u0092s anxious face... \n109  OMITTED \nCHAPTER FIFTEEN \u0096 SAYING GOODBYE \n110\tINT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT \nOn Jack...crouched down in an aisle of this local convenience store...checking out the bags of rock salt... \nHe looks at the price tag on one of the bags... \nJACK Four ninety nine?! It\u0092s just salt for god\u0092s sake... \nOn the entrance to the store...the door opens, a YOUNG GIRL, 17, enters, an average suburban teenager... \nShe glances at a fashion magazine, picks up a package of gum... \nFrom the POV of the cashier, we see the girl approach the counter... \nOn Jack, crouched down in the aisle. He grabs a bag of salt from the shelf, when... \nCASH (O.S.) That\u0092ll be sixty five cents, little angel... \nJack registers the voice...he rises slowly, looking over to the front counter...where he sees... \nCash, dressed in a typical chain convenience store uniform, ringing up the teenager... \nAn excited smile from Jack at the sight of Cash... \nJACK You...! \nThen...the color drains from Jack\u0092s face... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) What are you doing here... \nJack moves toward Cash at the counter... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) You\u0092re not sending me back... \nThe girl eyes Jack curiously, then removes a dollar bill from her pocket and slides it across the counter to Cash... \nCASH Jack, it\u0092s good to see you... \nCash reaches into the register, taking out change for ten dollars...he hands the girl $9.35... \nCASH (CONT\u0092D) (to the girl) Thank you darlin\u0092... \nThe girl looks at the money, realizing that Cash has given her the wrong change... \nCASH (CONT\u0092D) (back to Jack, seeing the rock salt) What do you got there, rock salt?  Look at you, all domestic and shit... You really figured some things out, huh? \nThe girl looks at Cash talking to Jack... \nJACK I\u0092m not going back... \nThe girl hesitates...Cash turns to her... \nCASH (to the girl) Everything okay...? \nShe looks at him, a moment of decision, then... \nTEENAGE GIRL Yeah...fine. \nJACK (raising his voice) Hey! Did you hear me...?! \nCash ignores Jack, watching the girl as she heads to the door, hesitates a moment, then walks out... \nA look of disappointment on Cash\u0092s face as he reaches into his pocket, pulling out a little notebook... \nCash looks at Jack. \nCASH (making a note in his book) \nThat was a character issue... (shaking his head) ...and for nine dollars? That\u0092s just sad... \nJACK Hey, I\u0092m talking to you! I am not going back, do you understand...?! \nCash looks at him, compassion on his face. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) You can\u0092t do this. You can\u0092t keep coming in and out of people\u0092s lives, messing things up... \nCASH C\u0092mon, Jack... \nJack throws six bucks on the counter... \nJACK I\u0092ve got kids, I\u0092m going home... \nCASH You know what the word glimpse means, J? It\u0092s by nature an impermanent thing. \nJack walks determinedly toward the exit. He stops and turns at the door... \nJACK (pointing at Cash) I\u0092m staying. \nCash follows him with his eyes, a proud look on Cash\u0092s face as Jack leaves... \n111\tINT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, JOSH\u0092S ROOM - LATE NIGHT \nJack walks to Josh.  He\u0092s sleeping soundly. \nJack gently kisses Josh on the head, careful not to wake him. \n112\tINT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, ANNIE\u0092S ROOM - LATE NIGHT \nJack looks at the clock, \u00939:23 a.m.\u0094  He gets out of bed, throwing on pants and a pair of shoes, and leaves the room... \n117\tINT. JACK\u0092S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \n...Jack walks to the door just as... \nThe doorbell RINGS.  He stops, then cautiously opens the door, seeing... \nPAULA, wearing a long overcoat and a wide smile on her face. \nPAULA Waiting for me by the door, huh? \nJack looks at her. \nJACK Paula... \nPaula opens her coat \u0096 the only thing she has on underneath is a sexy little teddy. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) (momentarily distracted) That\u0092s totally see through... \nPAULA (smiling) Merry Christmas... \nJACK (confused) Christmas?  It can\u0092t be Christmas... \nJack stares at her, totally confused... \nPAULA (lasciviously) It\u0092s whatever you want it to be, Jack... \nJack grabs a leather jacket then walks right by a shocked Paula and heads out the door, practically running down the corridor. \nPAULA (CONT\u0092D) Jack?...Jack! \nCUT TO: \n118\tEXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - MORNING \nJack\u0092s Ferrari speeds down the bridge, toward Jersey... \n119\tEXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - MORNING \nJack\u0092s Ferrari pulls up in the driveway and he hops out. He races to the front door, POUNDING on it... \nA MAN in a Van Heusen shirt and Hagar slacks answers. Jack stares at him in shock. \nMAN Can I help you? \nJACK Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?! \nMAN Kate? No, there\u0092s no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you? \nJack starts rapping his head against the door post, much to the shock of the guy standing there. \nJACK Damn...damn...damn... \nMAN Hey, are you okay? \nJACK No...I\u0092m not... \nMAN Is there anything I can do for you? \nJack shakes his head mournfully. \nMAN (CONT\u0092D) Hey, my wife\u0092s in the kitchen.

ARNIE\u0092S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER \nJack\u0092s car drives by as Arnie carries a bicycle box out to the garbage.  The car screeches to a halt in front of the driveway. \nARNIE (shouting at Jack) Hey, you can\u0092t park that thing here. \nJACK (out the window) It\u0092s me, Jack... \nARNIE I don\u0092t care if you\u0092re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can\u0092t park here. \nJACK Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please... \nARNIE How\u0092d you know my name? \nJACK We bowl together. We\u0092re bowlers ...we won a championship...we\u0092re winners. \nARNIE I never won anything in bowling. \nArnie peers at Jack through the window. \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) Wait a second... (thinking) Jack...Jack... \nJACK Yes...Jack Campbell... \nARNIE Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right? (at the Ferrari) You\u0092re doing well... \nJACK (remembering) Yes, that\u0092s it...yes, we went to high school together. \nARNIE You never really talked to me.

FERRARI - DAY \nJack driving...a CELL PHONE RINGS. \nA curious look on Jack\u0092s face, it\u0092s been a while since he\u0092s heard that sound. \nJACK (answering phone) Hello? \nADELLE (O.S.) Hey Santa, where are you?

To Paris. My firm has an office there and I\u0092m going to be heading it up. \nJACK (stunned) To Paris. Paris, France. \nKATE (searching the boxes) That\u0092s the one... \nJACK So you\u0092re not at a non- profit firm? \nKATE (a chuckle) Not with what they pay me... \nJACK You\u0092re not married, are you? \nKATE No, Jack, I never got married.

The La Guardia flight\u0092s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what? \nJack\u0092s smile disappears as Kate hands him a sealed box marked, \u0093Jack\u0094... \nKATE Here you go.  It\u0092s just some old things of yours... \nJack stands here, looking at the box, then at Kate... \nJACK Do you ever think about us, Kate?  About what might have happened...? \nA bemused LAUGH from Kate.  Then she sees he\u0092s not laughing... \nKATE You\u0092re serious... \nA nod from Jack... \nKATE (CONT\u0092D) I\u0092ll tell you what, Jack, if you\u0092re ever in Paris, look me up. Maybe we\u0092ll go for that cup of coffee. \nOne of the movers passes by Jack carrying a box... \nJack looks at Kate, flush with the realization that this isn\u0092t the same woman he knew thirteen years ago, or left yesterday. \nJACK Sure. Goodbye, Kate. \nHe leaves... \nCUT TO: \n126\tINT. JACK\u0092S APARTMENT - EVENING \nA scratchy Zeppelin album, the song \u0093All Of My Love,\u0094 fills the room. Jack, a fifth of Bushmill\u0092s by his side, goes through the box Kate gave him. \nHe removes a worn leather jacket, feeling the soft material, then a \u0093Mondale for President\u0094 button, which Jack smiles upon seeing, a couple Neil Young concert ticket stubs... \nHe puts the leather jacket on, then sticks the Mondale button on the lapel.  He digs back into the box, finding... \nA messy, dog-eared copy of \u0093Cat\u0092s Cradle\u0094...not the one Kate gave him at the airport, the one she replaced... \nJack looks at it for a moment...lost in his sadness... then... \nHe looks over at the clock, it reads, \u00938:29.\u0094 \n", "test1_input": "Arnie takes one last swig of his beer and gets up... \nARNIE (CONT\u0092D) I\u0092ll see ya later, Jack... \nHe leaves Jack alone, thinking... \nCHAPTER TEN - CAKE WARS \n69\tINT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - NIGHT \nJack walks into the house carrying his bowling bag.  He dumps the bag in the coat closet and walks into the kitchen where... \nKate is at the counter, her back to him, poring over some legal documents. \nKATE (not looking up) How was the game, honey? \nJACK (opening the fridge) Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it... (peering inside) Hey, where\u0092s that chocolate cake...? \nKate turns around, revealing a huge hunk of chocolate cake on a plate in front of her, a bite ready to go into her mouth. \nKATE (with a smile) You mean this chocolate cake? \nJACK That\u0092s my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken. \nKate takes the bite, a little piece of icing sticks to the side of her mouth. \nKATE It\u0092s good... \nJack approaches the counter. \nJACK Gimme that cake. \nShe takes another bite. \nKATE No way. \nHe makes a grab for the plate but she holds it out where he can\u0092t reach it. \nJACK C\u0092mon. \nKATE Sorry, Jack.  It\u0092s too important to me. \nThey stare each other down a moment.  Then... \nHe tries to swipe the plate.  Kate jumps out of her chair, running out of the kitchen with the cake, laughing... \nJack takes off after her...chasing her through the house... just about the catch up to her when... \nShe darts up the stairs, still laughing...he follows her... \nJACK I want that cake! \n...reaches up...grabs her shirt...pulls her down playfully on top of him... \nKATE (laughing) You want the cake!? \nJACK (out of breath) I want it... \nShe looks at him, then takes the whole piece in her hand and smooshes it right in his mouth... \nBeat.  Then, Jack starts laughing... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Thank you... \nKATE It\u0092s good, right? \nHe takes a big clump of it and smooshes it in her mouth. \nThey stay there a moment, lying on the stairs, feeding each other cake, laughing. \nJack leans back on the stairs.  He looks at Kate\u0092s face, practically covered in cake, smiling, and realizes... \n...he hasn\u0092t laughed like this in thirteen years. Then... \nJACK Are the kids asleep? \nA sexy smile from Kate...they start kissing passionately right there on the steps...it\u0092s heating up... \nKATE (caught up in the moment) Say it, Jack... \nJACK What...? \nKATE C\u0092mon, you know what I like to hear... \nJACK (in the throes of passion) Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear... \nKATE (kissing him) Then say it...just say it to me...! \nJACK (swept up in the moment) Oh yeah, you\u0092re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I\u0092m gonna take you to that special place... \nKate pulls away. \nKATE What...? \nJack looks up at her, he can practically see the passion drain from her face... \nJACK Not it...? \nKATE Nice, Jack.  You\u0092re sweeping me off my feet. \nJACK What? You make me hot... \nShe gets up and heads up the steps, disappearing into the bedroom...Jack shakes his head, frustrated.  Then, he feels something licking at his hand... \nHe looks down and sees Lucy standing next to him, wagging her tail, looking up at Jack with an \u0093I\u0092ve gotta go\u0094 look on her face.

Jesus, Bill, this thing is an antique.  Don\u0092t you even have image stabilization? \nBill stops playing and looks up at Arnie. \nBILL KRAMER Four hundred bucks at Best Buy, Arn. \nThen...Jack comes into frame, a confident smile on his face. \nJACK And everyone knows image stabilization is for the weak... \nJack is jarred by the image of himself on the video... \nJack on TV...he smiles as Kate walks into frame, easily putting an arm around Jack... \nARNIE So Jack, it\u0092s your wife\u0092s birthday, got anything to say to her? \nJACK (to Kate) It\u0092s your birthday?

You\u0092re my wife? \nShe slaps him playfully on the arm... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) I do have one thing I wanna say... \nKate looks at him expectantly.  Then... \nJACK (CONT\u0094D) (singing to her) Oh those fingers in my hair, that sly come hither stare, strips my conscience bare, it\u0092s witchcraft... \nJack doesn\u0092t have the greatest voice in the world but he\u0092s not the least bit self-conscious...and Kate seems to like it, there\u0092s a twinkle in her eye...some of the guests focus their attention on Jack and Kate. \nJack winces, embarrassed, as he watches himself sing... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) ...and I\u0092ve got no defense for it, that heat is too intense for it, what good would common sense for it do... \nBill Kramer still at the piano, chimes in with the basic chords for \u0093Witchcract,\u0094 sounding it out as he goes along... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) ...\u0091Cause it\u0092s witchcraft, wicked witchcraft...and although I know it\u0092s strictly taboo...when you rouse the need in me, my heart says yes indeed in me, proceed with what you\u0092re leadin\u0092 me to... \nThe camera catches the reactions of guests in the crowd... the women, smiles on their faces, wrapped up in the romance of the moment.  Envy on the men\u0092s faces as they watch Jack serenade his wife... \nA musical interlude from Bill as Jack takes off his jacket...some HOOTS and HOLLERS from the crowd...Arnie captures the image of Kate whistling at her husband... \nArnie follows with the camera as Jack strolls in front of the gathered guests... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) It\u0092s such an ancient pitch, but one that I\u0092d never switch, there ain\u0092t no nicer witch than you... \nJack watches himself move gracefully.  But it\u0092s no longer embarrassment on his face, it\u0092s fascination... \nBack in the video, the camera catches Evelyn Thompson watching longingly as Jack moves back toward Kate...Evelyn can\u0092t take it anymore, she abruptly turns and walks toward the kitchen... \nJack raises an eyebrow... \nIn the video...Jack approaches Kate, she couldn\u0092t have a more delighted look on her face.

BIG ED\u0092S TIRED, JACK\u0092S OFFICE - LATE \nJack leaning back in his chair, behind the desk of his cluttered, cramped office. \nJACK ...truth is, Mintz was so busy timing his wife\u0092s breathing he didn\u0092t see that MedTech needed Global more than the other way around.  Ten days, two weeks tops, they would\u0092ve approached you with an offer, and I\u0092d bet anything it would\u0092ve been thirty billion, not twenty nine... (a knowing smile) Problem was, Peter, you had a pussycat running the show. What you needed was a rottweiler. \nLassiter, sitting on the little chair across from Jack, an intrigued look on his face... \nLASSITER (nodding) Well, I\u0092m impressed. \nA smile from Jack. \nLASSITER (CONT\u0092D) I really am... \nJack savors the moment, until... \nLASSITER (CONT\u0092D) So, about my car... \nHe\u0092s jarred back to reality, a little crestfallen... \nJACK Sure. We\u0092re going to have to special order that tire.

ALAN MINTZ\u0092S OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nPast the assistant\u0092s desk... \nMINTZ\u0092S ASSISTANT (seeing Lassiter) He\u0092s expecting you, Mr. Lassiter... \nLassiter doesn\u0092t even slow down... \n99\tINT. ALAN MINTZ\u0092S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nIt\u0092s Jack\u0092s old office but you wouldn\u0092t know it from the decor...lots of country pine, a fabric sofa, and a play pen where the bar used to be.  Jack enters, immediately struck by the difference... \nLASSITER (to Mintz) Alan, this is Jack Campbell...the one I was telling you about... \nMintz, a confident look on his face, gets up from the desk and goes to shake Jack\u0092s hand. \nALAN Jack, of course. \nThey shake hands. \nJACK (appropriately deferential) Mr. Mintz. \nALAN Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here... \nJACK (re: play pen) I can see that, Alan. \nA chuckle from Mintz. \nALAN You have kids, Jack? \nJACK (hesitating, then...) Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones. \nAnother laugh from Mintz. \nALAN That\u0092s great... (gesturing to the sofa) Why don\u0092t you have a seat? \nJack nods, sits down on the plush sofa, Mintz and Lassiter take the chairs. \nALAN (CONT\u0092D) So, Peter mentioned that you were an avid CNBC watcher but didn\u0092t say whether you had any actual Wall Street experience? \nJack\u0092s a little taken aback by the question, not realizing he was walking into an interview... \nHe crosses his legs, trying to get comfortable. \nJACK I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton. \nALAN A broker? Really. And now you\u0092re in the tire business? \nJACK That\u0092s right. And auto supply... \nALAN Uh huh. The retail end, I understand. \nJack nods... \nJACK Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service. \nALAN Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark... \nJACK We did one point seven million in total revenue... \nALAN Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year? \nJack pauses, analyzing the situation...the patronizing questions, the smirk on Mintz\u0092s face... \nALAN (CONT\u0092D) Any thoughts at all on that? \nAs Jack stares into their faces, he realizes the extent of his handicap... \nALAN (CONT\u0092D) Jack? \nHe stops, takes a moment, looking at Mintz and Lassiter then ...a confident smile. \nJACK Well, Alan, I think we\u0092re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account. \n", "test3_true": "A gleam in Jack\u0092s eye. \nJACK That\u0092s right. And that would make us number one in our market... (getting up) You mind if I stand? \nA raised eyebrow from Mintz. \nMintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he crosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of water... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger... \nALAN I\u0092m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack. \nJACK (a confident chuckle) It\u0092s okay, Alan. I get it. I\u0092m in your shoes, I\u0092m thinking exactly the same thing...but here\u0092s the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, it\u0092s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell they\u0092re gonna send their kids to college.  It\u0092s just people... \nJack\u0092s confidence is throwing Mintz off, but Lassiter appears intrigued... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) And I know people. \nALAN I\u0092m sure you do... \nLASSITER (intervening) Let\u0092s let the man have his say... \nMintz covers his embarrassment with a smile... \nJACK (to Mintz) Take you, for instance... \nALAN (defensive) What about me? \nJACK You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You\u0092re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch... \nJack looks around the office then back to Mintz. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) And your wife decorated this office... \nA laugh from Lassiter as Mintz sits there stewing, a caught look on his face. \nLASSITER He certainly has your number, Alan. \nJACK (turning to Lassiter) You\u0092re a little tougher, Peter. \nA raised eyebrow from Lassiter, but he\u0092s game... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) For one thing, you like expensive things. \nLASSITER (smiling proudly) That\u0092s easy. You\u0092ve seen my car. \nJACK (a chuckle) Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You\u0092re a scotch man, single malt, not because it\u0092s trendy but because you\u0092ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand... \nLassiter\u0092s impressed. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) And you\u0092re a man who prides himself on finding talent in unusual places... \nLASSITER Oh? And how would you know that? \nJack smiles. \nJACK Because I\u0092m here. \nOn Lassiter...nodding his head. Mintz, a plastered-on smile. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) I\u0092m prepared to do anything it takes to get this job. Start anywhere you need me to start. I\u0092ll park cars if I to... (into Lassiter\u0092s eyes) The biggest part of judging character is knowing yourself. And I know this, I can do this job. Give me a chance, Peter, I won\u0092t let you down. \nLassiter returns Jack\u0092s gaze with equal intensity. In a moment, he turns to Mintz. \nLASSITER (to Mintz) Alan, why don\u0092t you show Jack around a bit... \nALAN I\u0092d love to. \nCUT TO: \n100\tINT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER \nJack and Alan walking side by side down the hallway... EMPLOYEES passing them by, greeting Mintz, Mintz waving back... \nALAN (pointing) ...that\u0092s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile. \nJACK (not particularly impressed) Seven.  Really. \nThey turn a corner, coming into a deserted section of the corridor. \nMintz stops, turning to Jack.  Jack returns Mintz\u0092s gaze with a quizzical look. \nALAN Let\u0092s cut the shit, huh Campbell? What, did you go through his wallet or something? \nJack\u0092s a little taken aback. \nALAN (CONT\u0092D) No matter. That circus act back there may have dazzled Lassiter momentarily but it doesn\u0092t do shit forme. Even if you get this job, which I highly doubt, let me warn you, Lassiter loses interest in his pet projects very quickly. I\u0092m in the big office because I\u0092ve proved myself to him year after year and nobody is going to come in here and start turning the old man\u0092s head. Especially not some tire salesman from New Jersey. So you watch yourself and stay away from Lassiter, and maybe, just maybe, I\u0092ll keep you on after he gets tired of you. Do we understand each other? \nJack stands there, staring at Mintz, silent, expressionless. \nALAN (CONT\u0092D) Do we?! \nThen, a broad smile from Jack. \nJACK God, you really are different, aren\u0092t you... (nodding) I mean...wow...I am impressed. \nNow it\u0092s Mintz\u0092s turn to look quizzical. \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Good for you. Why shouldn\u0092t you protect what\u0092s yours. \nALAN I don\u0092t think you\u0092re hearing me. \nJACK Oh, I\u0092m hearing you, Alan. That\u0092s not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  And I don\u0092t care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back... (poking him in the chest) So do yourself a favor and don\u0092t get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office. \nJack smiles at Alan one more time, then turns... \nJACK (CONT\u0092D) Oh, and by the way, you try selling tires for a living.  I promise you, you\u0092d starve. \nJack heads down the corridor, whistling a happy tune, leaving Mintz standing there, bewildered. \n"}

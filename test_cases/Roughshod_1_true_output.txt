MARY Would they be good to eat? 
MARY (not too sure) Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were... 
STEVE Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?... 
Mary starts to protest -- Steve goes on. 
STEVE An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them? 
MARY You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good. 
STEVE (stubbornly) I feel good anyways. 
REVERSE SHOT 
ANGLED PAST Clay. 
CLAY Don't go arguing with your teacher. 
STEVE I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to. 
CLAY There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or -- (motioning) -- go back and watch the horses. 
He touches his horse with his spurs and rides on ahead. 
MED. CLOSE 
ANGLED PAST Mary. Steve in the b.g. Mary looks after Clay, puzzled, wondering. Then she looks over at Steve. 
MARY Well, Steve? 
STEVE (grinning) Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next? 
EXT. FOREST TRAIL 
Here the forest has thinned out. The trail climbs a rise, then drops down. Clay jogs along the trail, his rifle across his knees. As he reaches the edge of the forest at the crest of the rise, he suddenly pulls his horse to a stop, swings around and rides back into the trees. Throwing the reins over the horse's head, he swings out of the saddle and moves cautiously to the crest of the hill. 
LONG SHOT 
Clay's ANGLE. The trail leads down through open country to a big meadow ringed with lodgepole pine, and across the meadow to start climbing toward another, higher range of hills. Three horsemen on roans, Lednov, Peters and McCall, are crossing the meadow slowly. 
MED. SHOT 
DOWN ANGLE. Lednov, Peters and McCall as they ride across the meadow. 
CLOSE SHOT 
Clay, as he peers down. He cocks his rifle. The voices of Mary and Steve and the SOUND of the approaching wagon can be heard o.s. Clay turns his head. 
FULL SHOT 
the cavalcade. Mary and Helen are in the seat of the wagon. Steve rides alongside. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Clay. He lowers his rifle, waves at them to stop and be quiet, rises and hurries down the hill, CAMERA PANNING WITH him. 
EXT. MEADOW 
MED. SHOT of Lednov as he pulls in his limping horse, steps, looking back over his shoulder as though he sensed an unfamiliar presence. The other two watch him, frowning. Then he shrugs and glances down at the bad leg of his mount. 
LEDNOV We'll camp on up ahead away. That leg ain't good... 
As they start away, moving slowly toward the trees in the distance... 
MED. FULL SHOT 
Clay motions to Mary to stop as he hurries toward the wagon. Mary reins in the mules. 
CLAY We're staying here until dark. (motioning) Pull over to the woods. (to Steve) You put hobbles on the horses -- all of 'em. Get goin'. 
DISSOLVE OUT 
EXT. HILLTOP - DUSK DISSOLVE IN 
LONG SHOT. Clay, in close foreground, stands, leaning on his rifle. The sun has set and the valley below is in shadow. There is the silence of dusk. No wind stirs the trees. There is some light outlining the high mountains -- treeless crags and domes and spires. Clay turns. 
REVERSE SHOT 
Down the hill in the forest, is the wagon. Beyond it the horses stand. Steve is stretched out on his stomach studying his magazine. Helen is sitting on a tarp playing solitaire. Clay starts down the hill toward the camp. 
MED. SHOT - UP ANGLE 
Clay walks through the trees. As he comes around a big yellow pine, he stops suddenly and looks down. 
MED. CLOSE 
ANGLED DOWN PAST Clay. Mary lies on the carpet of pine needles, her head pillowed on her arms, her dress pulled taut across her chest. She is looking up through the trees at the fading sky. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Clay stares down at Mary. She does not look at him. She is aware of his presence, but she doesn't show it. In the soft light of dusk she is very lovely. Clay is conscious of her lovliness. He would like to drop down beside her. 
CLOSE SHOT 
Mary. She turns her face to look at him. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS. Clay stands above her, looking down. For a moment their eyes meet. Clay starts away. CAMERA HOLDS ON Mary. 
MARY Where you goin'? Over to the other side of the street? 
MED. SHOT 
ANGLED PAST Mary, who rises slowly. Clay looks back, hesitates, then crosses to where the horses are tethered and starts saddling his mare. Mary moves down toward him through the trees.

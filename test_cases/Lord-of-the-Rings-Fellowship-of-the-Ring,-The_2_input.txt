ARWEN Noro lim, Asfaloth! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FORD OF BRUINEN -- DAY 
CRANE DOWN: As the White Horse races towards Camera, to Reveal the wide river Bruinen in the foreground. 
Without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow water and thunders across the Ford. The 9 Ringwraiths pull up short of the Ford, clearly nervous of the water. The white horse reaches the other side...Arwen pulls up and turns to defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford. 
WITCH KING Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws her sword and yells at the Witch King. 
ARWEN (yelling) If you want him, come and claim him. 
THE WITCH KING SCREECHES ANGRILY, draws his sword, and leads the Ringwraiths across the Ford. The water starts flowing faster...a distant rumble can be heard. Arwen waits until they are halfway across: she suddenly stands in the saddle arms raised! 
ARWEN (CONT'D) (Elvish) Non o Chithaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo nin Briunen Dan in Ulaer! (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ARWEN (CONT'D) Nin o Chitaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo nin Bruinen Dan in Ulaer! 
THE GROUND SUDDENLY TREMBLES...A MIGHTY ROAR FILLS THE AIR! 
Frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of Water flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had burst! The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing white horses with frothing manes! The Ringwraiths scream in terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. Their Piercing cries are drowned in the roaring of the river as it carries them away! CLOSE ON: FRODO as he loses consciousness... 
ARWEN (upset) No, no...Frodo, no!     Frodo, don't give in...not now! 
Arwen gathers the small Hobbit in her arms, feeling his life slip away. 
INT. FRODO'S DELIRIUM -- DAY 
DELIRIOUS IMAGES AND SOUNDS.... 
ARWEN (V.O.) What grace is given me, let it pass to him. Let him be spared. Save him. 
IMAGE: A BRIGHT LIGHT suddenly flares...Frodo squeezes his eyes shut, gasping. 
FRODO (frightened) Where am I? 
A FAMILIAR VOICE cuts through the swirl of sound. 
GANDALF (O.S.) You are in the House of Elrond, and it is ten o'clock in the morning on October the twenty-fourth, if you want to know. 
INT. FRODO'S BEDROOM -- DAY 
Frodo's eyes flicker Open He is lying in bed next to an Open Window...Dappled sunlight plays on richly carved timbers...the sound of a nearby waterfall drifts through the Vista of Fir Trees. 
FRODO (weak relief) Gandalf! 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF IS SITTING NEXT TO FRODO'S BED... 
softly puffing on his pipe.    He smiles at Frodo. 
GANDALF Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be here, too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. You have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit. 
Frodo sits up, looking at Gandalf questioningly... 
FRODO What happened, Gandalf?    Why didn't you meet us? 
GANDALF I'm sorry Frodo. 
Close on: Gandalf... troubled.   His eyes drift away. 
GANDALF (CONT'D) I was delayed. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ORTHANC SUMMIT -- NIGHT 
SARUMAN stands over Gandalf, gloating... 
SARUMAN Get up! So much for the power of the Ring or embrace your own destruction! 
With the power of his staff, Saruman raises Gandalf from the ground, then sends him crashing to the floor. 
GANDALF There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only one who can bend it to his will...and he does not share power. 
SUDDENLY! GANDALF lurches to his feet and Throws himself off the Tower! Saruman watches Gandalf fly away from Isengard...on the Back of a GIANT EAGLE. 
SARUMAN (chilling) So you have chosen death! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAINS--DAWN 
Gwaihir the Eagle soars majestically over the mountains, carrying Gandalf towards the dawn. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FRODO'S BEDROOM--RIVENDELL 
Frodo raises himself up and looks at Gandalf.

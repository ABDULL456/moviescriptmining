WANDA What the fuck is that?! Sound? 
SOUND (frantically checking his equipment) It's not me. 
BOOM It's the camera. 
WOLF The fuck it is. It's off; it's not even running. 
The beep continues, growing louder. 
WANDA (into her walkie) What's going on down there?! Do I have a lock-up?! Nothing? You don't hear a beeping sound? (to Nick) The street's quiet. 
NICK Then what the fuck is it!!? 
AC It's somebody's watch! 
Everybody holds their watches up to their ears. 
WOLF Not mine. 
WANDA Not mine. 
SOUND Not mine. 
BOOM Not mine. 
And so on, until all watches have been checked with negative results. The beeping continues, growing louder and louder. 
Suddenly Nick loses it. He starts running around the set, ripping things apart, knocking over tables, lamps, chairs. He shoves Cora off the couch and whips off the cushions, heaving them against the wall with a startling violence. 
NICK Where is it!! You motherfucker! You cock-sucking motherfucking bastard! Where the fuck are you!? Where!! Where!! 
Everyone watches Nick demolish the set in stunned, open- mouthed amazement. Nick turns to the crew in rage. 
NICK Can someone help me please?! Do I have to do everything myself here?! 
Nick loses it completely. 
NICK Hey, Cora. Why don't you go learn your lines! Hey Scriptgirl, are you finally going to pay attention here?! Hey, focus puller, you want to make a movie or get stoned?! Huh, I got some great fuckin' Thai Stick here! Hey Wolf, you pretentious, beret- wearing motherfucker! I saw your reel, man; it sucked! Who the hell would hire you anyway! Hey Wanda, next time can you wear a shirt that's a little more distracting to my actors! (to the Gaffer) Hey Bob! Hi Bob! Can you please make a little more noise on the dolly you creaky motherfucker! (to Cybil) What is your name!? What do you fucking do around here?! (to the Soundman) Hey Speedo, what's the matter? Can't even find a teeny fucking beep?! 
CU of Nicole. She turns away, unable to watch anymore. The beeping continues. 
NICK See what I have to put up with, Nicole!? Maybe next time you'll do some of that magic on camera!? But no, no -- wait till Wolf is puking his guts out, "Oh now I'll be good!!" 
WS, the entire room. Nick's last word echoes throughout the silent set. Suddenly he stops in the center of the demolished set and lets out a long, wrenching scream. 
INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. COLOR 
QUICK CUT TO extreme CU Nick's face, just as his eyes open. The film is in COLOR now. The room is in heavy darkness except for the light on Nick's face. Nick reaches over and shuts off his clock radio. The digital dial shows 4:00 A.M. The beeping finally stops. 
Nick turns on a light and sits up in bed, drenched in sweat and still breathing heavily. 
NICK God... (this is not a sigh of relief) 
The camera DOLLIES swiftly back away from Nick. He stares at it in stunned amazement. Just then a DOOR closes right into the lens turning the frame into complete BLACKNESS. 
Out of the BLACKNESS a door opens away from the camera revealing WANDA looking into her closet (the camera is inside the closet). From this point on, the rest of the film is in COLOR except where specifically indicated to be Black and White. 
INT. WANDA'S APT. DAWN 
She is wearing only a bra, black stretch pants, and cowboy boots. She rummages quickly through some blouses, selects the same garish one she wore in Part One, then walks away revealing WOLF sitting on the edge of the rumpled bed. He is dressed exactly the same as when we last saw him, complete with beret. He struggles groggily into his socks and boots. The entire apartment is in disarray. A bedside clock reads 4:13 A.M. 
WOLF Well, when did he ask you? 
WANDA Yesterday, when I was helping him check into his hotel. 
WOLF What, the guy can't even check into a hotel by himself? 
WANDA Listen, Wolf, having Chad Palomino in this movie will benefit us all. If being there when he checks into his hotel makes him feel better, then I'm happy to do it.

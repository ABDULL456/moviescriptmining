Percy packs his pipe, enjoys the moment - the young lion challenging the old. 
PERCY ALLELINE A new secret source of mine. 
SMILEY But how could he possibly have access to...? 
PERCY ALLELINE He has access to the most sensitive levels of policy making. 
Smiley stares at him, staggered. If it's true, this is the jackpot. Alleline enjoys his amazement, he leans over - points with bureaucratic pride to the FLAMES on the LETTER HEAD. 
PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D) We have named the operation "Witchcraft." 
SMILEY (Faintly) We? 
CONTROL Percy and his pals have bypassed us, Smiley. Gone straight to the Minister. Everyone's very excited. Percy's to be allowed to keep the identity of his new friend top secret. 
PERCY ALLELINE The Minister agrees with me that too many secrets are blown around here. Too much failure, too many scandals, too little solid intelligence! 
Control is still smiling but only now do we realise he is almost shaking with fury. 
CONTROL Luckily Percy's cabal has come to save us. 
PERCY ALLELINE (Bulldozing on) It's all office politics here. 
ROY BLAND Percy does have a point, Control. We should be fighting communism, not each other. 
PERCY ALLELINE Meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners... 
CONTROL Your bloody Yanks! 
PERCY ALLELINE (Shouting) And we've had enough! There's going to be changes, Smiley! Changes. 
Toby Esterhase finds his moment. 
TOBY ESTERHASE We need to decide if we're part of the past, or part of the future. 
CONTROL (Contemptuous) I should have left you where I found you. 
ROY BLAND Control, if we could all just... 
CONTROL OUT! ALL OF YOU! 
Alleline, Bland and Esterhase leave. For a moment it looks as if Haydon will stay, but then he stands up, shaking his head and saunters out. 
SMILEY (Cautiously) If Witchcraft is genuine... 
Now the others have left, Control seems to sag under the weight of some unnamed fear. He turns a haggard face to Smiley. 
CONTROL I don't trust miracles. 
We hear a KNOCKING and find ourselves back in... 
82   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY - PRESENT             82 
Mendel holds two mugs of tea in one hand, gives the agreed knock at Smiley's door again. After a moment a bleary Smiley opens the door and lets him in. 
83   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY                       83 
Mendel passes him the tea, takes in the desk piled high with papers. 
MENDEL (Of the tea) Courtesy of Mrs P. You been up all night? 
Smiley sits down wearily, sips his tea. 
SMILEY Yes. 
Mendel notices one SLIP OF PAPER, sitting alone on the opposite side of the desk. 
MENDEL What's that? 
SMILEY Request for a thousand pound's in cash from the reptile fund. 
MENDEL What for? 
SMILEY For a Mister Ellis. 
MENDEL Who's Ellis? 
Smiley leans back, rubs his tired eyes. 
SMILEY It was one of Jim Prideaux's work names. 
MENDEL What's so strange about that then? 
SMILEY The date. Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago. October twenty first. So why was (MORE) 
SMILEY (CONT'D) someone giving him a thousand pounds two months later?

{"train": "YEAR ONE \nWritten by \nHarold Ramis, Gene Stupnitsky & Lee Eisenberg \nOctober 18th, 2007 \nIN THE BEGINNING...       1 \nBLACK an infinite void but at the center a SINGULARITY, a particle infinitely small and infinitely dense that contains all the potential matter and energy in the universe. \nTHE BIG BANG A blinding flash of light as the singularity explodes, particles expanding in all directions until they fill the screen, a shimmering cloud of electromagnetic dust. Then the particles start to attract one another to form atoms, the atoms elements, the elements form molecules, the molecules compounds, the compounds cells, then a cell twitches and a PRIMITIVE DRUM starts booming out a Dolby heartbeat as we witness the rapid evolution of organisms. Then a big fish swims by and is suddenly swallowed whole by a much bigger fish, and we rapidly rise from the depths and pull back to reveal-- \nTHE SEA                   2 Vast, blue, rolling toward the shore, brilliant sun rising in a cloudless azure sky. A WOMAN emerges from the sea like Aphrodite, strongly backlit to obscure her nudity, but we can see she is full-breasted, long-limbed, toned and tanned-- perfection. Then a MAN rises up out of the water beside her, and staggers clumsily in the surf. Even in silhouette we can see he's far from perfect-- short, overweight. They turn to each other and embrace. It's paradise-- for him. \nTHE WOMAN (looking deep in his eyes) I'm so hungry. \nTHE MAN (wanting her) Yeah. Me, too. The DRUMS get hotter as he closes his eyes and leans in to kiss her, but she turns and walks away. \nWOMAN What should we eat? \nTHE MAN Oh, you actually meant you were hungry. I thought-- forget it. \nOfficial White                                                     2. He follows her. They walk toward the trees that fringe the beach. When they reach the line of vegetation, the woman, MAYA, kneels, pulls berries from a bush and pops them in her mouth. The man, ZED, grabs a handful of berries and they squat there noshing like Adam and Eve. \nTHE WOMAN Mmmm, these are so good. \nTHE MAN Mmrrunm, they really are . When she turns away he spits them out in disgust. Maya smiles and puts her face very close to his, their lips almost touching. \nMAYA (very sexy) You know what I'd really like? \nZED \n(HOPEFULLY) What? \nMAYA Some fruit. \nZED (frustrated, but hanging \nIN                                                              ) Yeah, fruit's good. (he stands up) You want an apple or a pear? \nMAYA \n(THINKS) No. He scans the nearby trees. \nZED Orange? Tangerine? (she shakes her head) Umm, mango? Kiwi? Peach? She shakes her head coyly. He starts darting from tree to tree, hopefully pointing out various options. She follows him. \nOfficial White                                                      3. ZED                                                      (cont'd) Plum? Nectarine? Passion fruit? \nMAYA \n(COQUETTISHLY) Nuh-uh. \nZED (fake smile) Okay, don't tell me-- papaya? Pomegranate? Lemon? Lime? Kumquat? Uh, cock? Cockfruit? \nMAYA \nNOOO-- The game is no longer cute but he still plays along. \nZED Watermelon? Honeydew? Grapes? \nMAYA \nNOOO-- \nZED (this is a lot of work to get laid) Starfruit, casaba-- tangelo? \nMAYA Nope. \n(GRUMBLING) Look at them. Hunters think they're so cool. They don't think gathering is dangerous? There are thorns-- bees-- those big stingy ants. I could hunt-- I just don't want to. And what's with the blood on their faces? They think that's sanitary? \nOfficial White                                                             7. \nZED (miserable with pain) Do me a favor. Just kill me. \nOH Why did you eat that fruit? It's forbidden. Everybody knows that. \nZED I couldn't help myself! Maya was just staring at me with those pouty eyes-- and those perky breasts-- opposable thumbs. And how about the name? \"The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil\"? You don't think that sounds tempting? They should've just called it \"The Tree with the Fruit that Tastes Like Shit.\" Then for sure nobody would eat it. Zed notices a VILLAGER squatting in the bushes right behind his dwelling. ZED                                                             (cont'd) (shouts testily) Hey! Squanto! Give me a break, would ya'! You got the whole forest! (to Oh) Why does everyone have to crap right behind my hut? \nOH I think, and I could be wrong, that all the poop makes the ground more fertile, which in turn, gives the leaves in the area a softer feel. It's a vicious circle. Oh notices a very pretty young woman, EEMA, standing near the communal fire with TWO HUNTERS. His heart leaps. OH                                                              (cont'd) (calls out eagerly) Hi, Eema! Eema turns, sees it's him and gives him a perfunctory wave, then turns back to the hunters and says something about Oh that makes them laugh. \nOfficial White                                                            8. OH                                                             (cont'd) She doesn't even know I exist. \n(LOVE-STRUCK) I want to lay with her so badly. \nZED I don't see it. I mean she's cute, but I don't think I'd lay with her. \nOH Of course not! She's your sister! It'd be like sleeping with your mother. \nZED which was a big mistake. I see that now. You think it won't be awkward the next morning but-- trust me, you just want to rip your eyeballs out. (shakes off the memory) Listen, if you want to impress Eema, tonight at the feast, do the fertility dance with her, then drag her back to your hut. \nOH My hut's a mess. And what if she struggles? \nZED So you give her a little tap on the head. Women respond to that-- \nOH \n(SIGHS) No. She only likes hunters-- not gatherers. They look over at Eema, who is now slowly stroking the shaft of a hunter's spear. \nZED I wouldn't read too much into that. She kisses, then tongues the spear tip. ZED                                                            (cont'd) Okay, that might mean something. The hunter Marlak walks by and stops. He's clearly half a rung lower on the human evolutionary scale. \nOfficial White                                                             9. \nMARLAK You didn't hunt today. \nZED Yes, Marlak. Very observant. I was indisposed. Got that intestinal thing that's been going around. Marlak grunts and examines the primitive line drawings on the walls of Zed's hut. \nMARLAK (points at a drawing) What's that supposed to be? \nZED It's a bear. \nMARLAK That's not a bear. That's just some lines on a skin. \nZED \n(SIGHS) It's not a real bear. It's a \"representation\" of a bear. You know, a \"picture.\" \nMARLAK That's stupid. \nZED Yeah. Like you'd know. \nMARLAK And what's that? He picks up a skin with another of Zed's drawings on it, this one of a big-breasted naked girl. Zed quickly grabs it and holds it upside down. \nZED That-- would be an antelope-- or a deer-- a deerpalope. \nMARLAK (trying to look at it upside down) It looks like Maya. \nOfficial White                                                                  10. \nZED (hides it away) How could it be Maya? It's just some lines on a skin. \nMARLAK Stay away from my woman. \nZED Your woman? I'm not sure dragging her into the bushes kicking and screaming means you have an actual \"thing\" going. Marlak cuffs him hard on the side of the head. \nMARLAK (walking off) Stay away. \nZED (calls after him) Hey! Nice supra-orbital ridge, fartface! \nMARLAK Enmebaragesi doesn't lie. Villagers gather around them, Maya and Eema among them. Marlak puts his spear point to Zed's throat. MARLAK (cont'd) The truth! \nOfficial White                                                       14. \nMAYA Zed, just admit it. You're just making it harder on yourself. \nZED (instantly annoyed) No, you just made it harder on myself! (to Marlak) Okay, fine, you got me. (gingerly moves the spear \nPOINT) Maya and I lay together on occasion. We're consenting adults and we have an adventurous sexual relationship. Maya looks shocked, and tries to signal Zed to shut up. \nMARLAK \n(STUNNED) You laid with my woman? \nZED Isn't that what we're talking about? Maya rolls her eyes. \nENMEBARAGESI No, I saw you eat the Forbidden Fruit. \nZED Oh, that! Yeah! I did eat the fruit. I was just kidding about humping Maya. Marlak knocks Zed to the ground. The DRUMMING stops. Oh comes running over and gets between Marlak and Zed. \nOH \n(FORCEFUL) Hey! What's going on? Marlak growls at him. OH                                                        (cont'd) (quickly looks up at the \nSKY) Oooh, shooting star. \nOfficial White                                                                                15. Zed gets to his feet. \nZED Look, Marlak, this is crazy. You're two of me. I'm not gonna fight you over a girl, okay? Zed starts to walk away but quickly pivots and throws a WILD HAYMAKER at Marlak who easily ducks it, and it hits an unsuspecting Enmebaragesi squarely in the nose. Zed                                                            (cont'd) (to Enmebaragesi) And let that be a lesson to your big friend- Marlak grabs Zed, lands two solid punches to Zed's mid- section, and then clocks him with a vicious right that sends him sprawling to the ground. \nMARLAK (standing over Zed) Your father was a great hunter, but you're like-- a girl. The hunters laugh. \nENMEBARAGESI Good one, Marlak. \nANOTHER HUNTER Zing. \nMARLAK Now I kill you. He's about to spear Zed when suddenly the Shaman screams and jumps between them. The villagers step back as the Shaman howls an incantation and shakes his magic rattle at Zed. \nSHAMAN (leaning close to Zed) We need to talk. \nCUT TO: \n7                                                              THE CAMPFIRE - MINUTES LATER   7 Zed and the Shaman sit side by side on a log, talking privately. \nOfficial White                                                         16. The Shaman is covered in skins, feathers, bones, beads, animal teeth, antlers and horns, his hair a mass of long, muddy dreadlocks, his face painted, his cheeks, nose, and ears pierced by shards of bone. But if not for his outlandish getup, zed could be talking to his pastor. \nSHAMAN You really ate the fruit? \nZED One bite! What's the big deal? \nSHAMAN (halfheartedly shakes a chicken-foot rattle at \nHIM) You don't eat the fruit! That's been the number one rule from the beginning of time. Since the Great Turtle climbed from the sea with the Earth on his back, drank the ocean, pooped out the mountains and the first man fell from the stars. \nZED I've always had trouble with the Great Turtle Theory-- too many unexplained gaps. \nSHAMAN Whatever. You're screwed now. \nZED Really? How screwed? Like I knew it was a rule but I'm a little fuzzy on the exact details. \nSHAMAN You're cursed, man, and if you stay here then we'll all be cursed. You have to leave. \nZED Where am I supposed to go? \nSHAMAN Up to you. From now on you're completely on your own. \nZED \n(DEFIANT) Oh, really? \nOH \n(SULLEN) Yeah, it's great. \nZED Come on, those hunters are idiots. In an hour they'll forget the whole thing. \nOH I don't think they'll forget the fire. \nZED You know what we should do? You and me should kill the biggest boar ever-- just huge!-- and take it back to the village. Just to show them. And we won't let anyone else eat it. They'll have to watch us eat it. \nOH If it's that huge how would we carry it back? \nZED \n(CONSIDERING) Fine, we'll just start with something small. A squirrel or something. \nOfficial White                                                            22. \nOH Yeah, we'll make everyone watch us eat a squirrel. Will you get real? There's no going back! There's, nothing to go back to! It's just ashes. \nZED \n(SCOFFS) Yeah, like it's so hard to build a new hut. It's just a pile of sticks and dung-- \nOH \n(SCOWLS) You're a pile of sticks and dung. Suddenly, Zed stops and stands perfectly still. \nZED (through clenched teeth) Oh! \nOH What are you doing? Zed makes a minimal gesture with his head. Oh looks up. A COUGAR crouches on a tree limb above them, poised to leap. Oh freezes. They talk like ventriloquists. \nZED Don't move a muscle. \nOH Will that work? \nZED (without moving his lips) I don't know. There's two different opinions on this one. Some say run, some say don't. \nOH What are you going to do? \nZED I'm going to-- RUN! He sprints off and the cougar pounces right on oh. \nCUT TO: \nOfficial White                                                                23. \n10                                                              EXT. A FIRE   - DAYBREAK   10 \nZed is holding a stick over the fire, cooking what looks like a squirrel or a muskrat. Oh comes out of the forest carrying a huge armload of sticks and branches. One of Oh's sticks falls, and as he carefully reaches down to grab it, the rest spill out on the ground. Oh sighs. His body is covered with long claw marks. \nZED You really should put some maggots on those scratches. They look pretty deep. \nOH \n(BITTER) I just want to know why you told me not to move, and you ran. \nZED Because I honestly thought he'd go for me. I thought I was doing you a favor. Apparently not appreciated. \nOH Yeah, big favor. \nZED You didn't have to come with me, you know. I didn't ask you to come. \nOH Yes, you did! You looked right at me-- twice. \nZED Yes, that's a technique of public speaking, but I didn't ask you specifically. You chose to come. You gotta take some responsibility for that. And there's no point coming if you're just gonna keep whining about every little-- cougar that attacks you. (pulls the cooked rodent from the fire) You want some or not? \nOfficial White                                                                          24. \nOH \nZED (getting painfully to his \nFEET) Yeah, well-- we're hunters. \nOH (covering for himself) He's a hunter. I'm more of a \"maker.\" I made this loincloth, I do arrows-- I made a shelf unit for my hut-- \nZED What do you guys do? \nSECOND YOUNG FARMER What does it look like? We're farmers. \nFIRST YOUNG FARMER He's a farmer; I'm a herdsman. \nSECOND YOUNG FARMER You're a suck, is what you are. \nFIRST YOUNG FARMER (ignores him) My brother, Cain. I am called Abel. \nCAIN You are called suck. \nABEL My brother is angry because God looked on my sacrifice with favor. \nOfficial White                                  28. \nCAIN (mimics him) \"God looked on my sacrifice with \nFAVOR--\" (to Oh) Okay, is he a total suck or what? \nOH Well, it's hard to say-- we just \nMET-- \nABEL Why are you dragging them into this? What do they know? They're morons. \nZED \n(OFFENDED) Hey! Easy! \nCAIN (to Abel) You think you're so superior to everyone else. \nABEL Superior-er than you. \nCAIN Really? Let's see how good you are at getting your ass kicked. (shoves him) \nABEL Yeah? Bring it! (shoves him back) \nZED Okay, boys, that's enough. We just want to-- \nCAIN (won't let it go) No! This smug asshole insulted you and I want him to take it back. \nZED We're not really that insulted-- \nCAIN (pushes Abel hard) Take it back! \nOfficial White                                                           29. \nABEL (pushes back) Make me! Zed steps between them, trying to make peace. \nZED Boys, boys! You're brothers! Let's just relax and-- Cain uses the distraction to sneak-punch Abel and the fight is on. They start throwing wild punches, then clinch and wrestle each other to the ground. \nOH Shouldn't we do something? \nZED Just let them settle it. Cain picks up a good-size rock and strikes Abel on the head with all his might. Abel falls heavily to the ground and lies there, not moving. Cain stands over him, breathing hard. ZED                                                           (cont'd) \n(SHOCKED) I guess that settles it. \nCAIN (turns on him sharply, still holding the bloody \nROCK) What?! \nZED Nothing! Cain stares at Abel, still inert on the ground. \nTHE CART with them riding on it, plodding slowly into a FARMING HAMLET,\u00c2\u00b0a cluster of small, roughly plastered mud houses with thatched roofs. ADAM, dour, hard-working and long-suffering, but still strong and upright, trudges home with a metal scythe over his shoulder. He could be Max Von Sydow. \nADAM (hailing Cain) Cain, my son! \nCAIN Hail, Father. Cain stops the cart and dismounts with Zed and Oh. CAIN                                                             (cont'd) Can these guys stay for supper? (off Adam's questioning \nLOOK) I bring strangers who would sojourn with us this night. Cain turns to Zed and Oh and furtively mimes an elaborate lip- sewing gesture, ancient precursor to the modern lip-zipper. \nADAM Greetings, strangers. I am called Adam and you are welcome to share the fruits of our toil. \nZED Thanks, but I'm kind of staying away from fruit for the time being. Zed gives Cain a subtle, acquiescent nod as Adam ushers them into his crude dwelling. \nOfficial White \n17                                                             INT. ADAM'S DWELLING - NIGHTFALL \nThe rude dwelling has a stark, somber, almost Amish feeling to it. Zed and Oh sit at the table sharing a simple meal       youngest with Adam, Cain and his Adam's wife EVE and h them, Lilith's tunic gaping open to reveal her breasts every time she leans over to put something on the table. Zed and Oh can't take their eyes off her. \nADAM (to Cain) Where is thy brother, Abel? \nCAIN (badly overplaying) Abel? Haven't seen him. I thought he was with you. (to Zed and Oh) You guys see him? They shake their heads and cough nervously. \nZED AND OH (equally unconvincing) Nape. Not that I remember. Never seen anybody-- anywhere-- anytime -- ever. \nADAM (to Cain) Your sister Lilith said she saw him in the field with you. \nCAIN I think that was yesterday. \nADAM No, this day. She said you both made offerings. \nCAIN That might've been Boaz--- \nADAM No, you and Abel. She said it looked like you were arguing. \nCAIN Hey, we're brothers, we argue sometimes- it's not that big a deal. \nOfficial White                                                           34. \nADAM And his flock was untended in the \nPASTURE-- \nCAIN \n(EXPLODES) Okay! What am I-- his keeper? Get off my back, will you? He smashes his plate against the wall and storms out. An awkward silence as Zed and Oh exchange guilty looks. \nADAM I fear the worst for Abel. I am sorely vexed. \nZED Yeah, that's got to be pretty vexing. A Bergmanesque gloom fills the hovel as Adam muses sullenly on his sorry circumstances. \nADAM For my sin the ground is cursed. Thorns and thistles does it sprout for us, and we are doomed to toil all the days of our lives. For as the Lord has commanded, by the sweat of your brow shall you get bread to eat until you return to the ground from which you were taken. For dust you are, and to dust shall you return. \nZED Wow. That's kind of a downer isn't it? \nADAM It's the way of the world. \nZED Boy, I hope not. \nADAM (rises abruptly) You are welcome to stay the night and lay with my daughter Lilith. Zed looks at the luscious Lilith, then back at Adam. \nOfficial White                                                                                   35. \nZED I'm waiting for the punchline. \nADAM She is without a husband, and as the Lord has said, thou shalt be fruitful and multiply. Lilith nods demurely and exits through a curtain. Zed starts to follow her out. \nOH Hey! What about me? \nADAM You may share the bed of my son Seth. \nMAYA How do you know God's a \"He?\" Zed rolls his eyes. \nZED Don't you get what I'm saying? What if we've been chosen? \nMAYA You think we've been chosen by God? \nZED Well, no offense, but it's possible that I was chosen and you all just happened to be there. \nOH Why would God choose you? Why wouldn't he choose Marlak? He's stronger. \nOfficial White                                                          45. \nZED A chosen doesn't need to be strong. I'm big this way. (points to his temples) \nOH You do have a fat face. \nZED Not my face, my brain. It's enormous. I'm the smartest guy in the village. \nOH \n(SCOFFS) You're not even-- I'm smarter than you! \nZED What?! (to ANOTHER VILLAGER) Which one of us is smarter? \nVILLAGER You're both idiots! \nZED Oh yeah, then why are we free and you're chained up? \nVILLAGER Because of you? \nCAIN (calls them over) Hey! Come here. I think we worked something out. \nZED (confidently, to Maya) Sit tight. I'm going to get you out of here. Do you trust me? \nMAYA \n(HEDGING) I want to trust you. \nZED Fair enough. She gives him an encouraging hug, then Zed and Oh cross to Cain and the slave trader. \nOfficial White                                                                                      46. ZED                                                            (cont'd) (to Cain) Good work. What's the deal? The slave owner smiles. \nCUT TO: \n26                                                             EXT. SLAVE MARKET - A LITTLE LATER   26 \nZed and Oh are dragged onto the platform in shackles and leg irons. They see Cain riding off on a donkey. He holds up a bag of coins and waves goodbye. \nZED I never trusted that guy. \nOH \n(SARCASTIC                                                     ) Why? Just 'cause he murdered his brother and got hit by lightning? They are pushed to the front of the platform. \nSLAVE TRADER (to the crowd) All right! Next up is a twofer-- I'm selling them as a pair-- I know they don't look like much-- but I'm starting the bidding at sixty gold minas. Do I hear sixty? \n(NOTHING) Remember, it's two for one here. Do I hear fifty? Anyone? That's only twenty-five apiece, folks. \n(NOTHING) Zed looks out at the crowd, starting to get offended. SLAVE TRADER (cont'd) You're breaking my heart here. How about forty? Do I hear forty? \n(NOTHING) \nZED (to Oh) It's not like I want to be a slave or anything, but this is embarrassing! \nOfficial white                                                                                 47. \nSLAVE TRADER Thirty-five?

Their hats are really great, aren't they? \nOH Their hats? I'm sorry, but when that one guy cut the other guy's head off, my first thought wasn't, \"Gee, what a great hat.\" \nZED It wasn't my very first thought, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't up there. \n(WATCHFUL) Now we just need to figure out a way to rescue Maya and Eema. \nOH How are we going to rescue anybody? They're killers! \nZED \n(WILY) Patience, my friend. Even killers have to sleep sometime. He keeps a sharp, wakeful eye on the enemy camp. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n31                                                           THE MORNING SUN   31 Zed and Oh fast asleep on the ridge.

I think I was over- tired. Then Zed suddenly remembers Maya. He looks and sees that the soldiers and slaves are long gone. \nZED Shit! He leaps to his feet, looks around desperately, and sees nothing but a vast wasteland in every direction. \nOH Now where do we go? Zed sniffs the air, puts his ear to the ground, and tastes the sand. \nZED I have no idea. \nCUT TO: \n32                                                             ZED AND OH   32 trudging across the desert in the blistering heat, growing weaker, stumbling and falling. \nOH (too weak to move) Why do I listen to you? Now we're going to starve to death or die of thirst. \nZED Will you stop being so negative? I got your back, man. Who saved you from those lions when you were a baby? They were going to pounce, had you surrounded. Took the mama lion-- BAM!-- kneed her right in the face. Papa lion comes flying at me-- BAM!-- dropped an elbow, knocked his ass out. \n(MORE) \nOfficial White                           53.

And the rest just ran off. \nOH You know, I've asked people about that and no one else seems to remember it. \nZED Yeah, because nobody else was there. You're lucky I was walking by. \nThe spacious tent is lit by torches, and a feast is in progress. TWENTY OR THIRTY BEARDED MEN in skullcaps and long robes lounge on cushions or sit cross-legged in a circle on the carpeted floor. An EGYPTIAN BELLY DANCER shakes her hips for the pleasure of Abraham who occupies the place of honor. Zed and oh, now also wearing robes and skullcaps, are sitting right beside him eating and drinking everything in sight. Isaac sits beside them. ABRAHAM claps his hands for attention. Zed and Oh look up as the music stops. \nABRAHAM (to the assembly) My brothers, let us give thanks unto God for staying my hand on the mountain this day. \nISAAC (humoring him) Best dad in all the land, everyone! \nTHE KINSMEN (a ritual response, in \nUNISON) Praise be to God, hallowed be His name. \nABRAHAM And for the bounty which He hath bestowed unto us. \nOfficial white                                                         57. \nTHE KINSMEN (in unison) He hath increased our wealth and blessed us with His loving kindness. Zed and Oh mutter along, trying to fit in. \nZED AND OH (a beat late) --mumble mumble mumble loving kindness. Abraham looks at them. \nABRAHAM Friends, whence comest thou? Zed and Oh look at each other blankly. \nISAAC \n(HELPFULLY) He wants to know where you're from. \nABRAHAM \n(SUSPICIOUS) Thou comest not from the cities of the plain? From Sodom or Gomorrah? Zed perks up at the mention of Sodom, recalling the destination of the soldiers who took Maya and the others. \nZED Sodom and Gomorrah? Never been there. But I've heard of them. \nOH Are they nice? \nABRAHAM The Lord has cursed them for their abomination. \nZED (nods gravely) i didn't know that. What kind of abomination are we talking about? \nABRAHAM They bow down before false Gods and worship graven images. \nOfficial White                                                        58. \nZED (clicks his tongue) Abominable. \nABRAHAM The men of the city are weak and soft, fat with rich food, intoxicated by strong drink. \nZED (sounds good to him) Really. Tell me more. \nABRAHAM Their women are whores; their shameless lust knows no bounds. They flaunt their flesh without shame and any man may have knowledge of them. \nOH (he's sold) And where exactly are those cities? \nZED (off Abraham's stern look) We just want to know so we can avoid them. \nABRAHAM \n(FIERCELY) Walk not the path of Sodom! For surely will the Lord send his holy fire to destroy the city and all who dwell within, to smite them and all their seed for their iniquity. \nZED \n(CONCERNED) When do you think all this smiting is going to go down? We may have some friends there. \nABRAHAM (getting up) Accompany me. Abraham sweeps out of the tent. Zed and Oh jump to their feet and follow.

THE TENT - CONTINUOUS   36 \nAbraham walks to the edge of the desert. Torchlight from the camp flickers on his face as he gazes across the desolate moonlit landscape. \nZED Abraham, I'm a little worried about the city being destroyed. \nOfficial White                                                                                     62. \nZED No!

Isaac takes a couple of steps to the top of a rise and points off in the distance. \nTHEIR POV Shining in the moonlight, the magnificent city of Sodom set atop a broad hill surrounded by high walls. \nZED I knew it was right around here. \nISAAC Me and my friends sneak in on the weekends. We hang around, pick up on the babes, drink some wine, get wasted on killer hash-- \nZED You shouldn't be smoking either. \nISAAC Thanks, Grandpa, but I've been smoking for four harvests, so I think I'm okay. They start down toward the city. \nCUT TO: \n38                                                              EXT. CITY GATES - NIGHT            38 \nZed, Oh and Isaac gape at the high masonry walls as they approach the massive solid wooden gates. \nOfficial White                                                             63. \nOH Gee, they're not open. We should probably come back later. \nISAAC You just have to knock. They always let me in. (to Oh) Go ahead. \nOH Me? Why do I have to knock? What if we're waking somebody up? Let's just get out of here. \nZED Where? Back to the penis-cutter? Besides, Eema and Maya might be in there. You want to get them out before the city's destroyed, don't you? Isaac impatiently grabs a big rock and starts banging on the door. \nISAAC \n(SHOUTING) Hey! Anybody there? Hello? Suddenly Zed and Oh are yanked off their feet from behind and slammed into the wall by helmeted sentries. Isaac quickly runs away. \nSENTRY (shouts at him) Halt! Isaac stops a safe distance away and turns back to taunt the guards. \nISAAC You gonna make me? (dancing and dodging like a boxer) You and what army? \nZED (shouts to Isaac) Get help!

He takes off running. \nZED (to Oh) I kinda get why his dad wanted to kill him.

GATEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS   39 \nThe sentries shove them into a small guard post and throw them up against the wall. THREE OTHER GUARDS look up at the new arrivals. \nFIRST GUARD What's this now? \nSENTRY They were banging on the gate. Hebrews, from the look of them. \nZED We're not really Hebrews-- The guard smacks him in the mouth. ZED                                                             (cont'd) Okay. Lesson learned. No talking. \nSENTRY Should we wake the Sergeant? \nFIRST GUARD You don't want to do that. He gets pretty mean when you wake him. \nOH Meaner than this? The sentry grabs Oh's nipple and twists. Oh SCREAMS loudly. The guards freeze at the sound of his scream and look nervously to a closed door at one end of the room. \nOH Well, I kind of have a girlfriend-- not a girlfriend, yet, but a girl I like, so I shouldn't-- \nCAIN Hey, what happens in Sodom, stays in Sodom. He takes a jug of wine from the stall of a WINE MERCHANT. The merchant just bows obsequiously and keeps his mouth shut. CAIN                                                            (cont'd) You know, if you guys are staying you should join the guards. The pay's not great, but there's tons of perks. I'm telling you, it's the only way to go. Cain grabs a piece of candy from a SMALL CHILD and stuffs it in his mouth. The child starts crying, Cain kicks her in the ass and she runs away. \nOfficial White                                                                      69. \nOH (to the child) Sorry. \nCAIN Come on, I'll introduce you to the captain. \nCUT TO: \n41                                                              EXT. BARRACKS       - NEXT MORNING   41 \nA military drum roll and the blare of trumpets rouse the garrison. GUARDSMEN come double-timing out of the barracks and hurry to line up in formation. Last to emerge are Zed and Oh who step leisurely out the door now dressed as Royal Guards. Zed actually looks dashing, but Oh's breastplate is too big and his helmet keeps slipping down over his eyes. \nZED This is great! How do I look? \nOH You look good, but I think my hat's too big. They notice an OFFICER staring at them. OH                                                              (cont'd) (to the officer) Do you happen to know where I could get a smaller hat? The officer pops him on the head with a truncheon. \nOFFICER \n(ROARS) Line up!

CITY STREETS   - LATER          42 \nZed and Oh are on patrol with Cain in the heart of the city. \nOfficial White                                            70. \nZED So is this it? We just walk around? \nCAIN Pretty much. We just look for troublemakers and kick the living shit out of 'em. \nZED What kind of trouble? \nCAIN If we see a thief or a pickpocket, we just slap him around-- maybe cut off a finger or an ear, or the tip of his nose, lower lip-- anything you can just grab and slice in one fluid motion-- then we take our share of the loot and let him go. Mostly what we worry about are activist types, rabble rousers, getting people all riled up against the King or the Temple Priests. That's death for sure. \nZED Pretty harsh, isn't it? \nCAIN Harsh times, brother. We're in the middle of a famine. People are starving. If we don't get some rain soon, it could get ugly. (looking forward to it) Then we'll get to start kicking ass big time. He stops to flog a BEGGAR with his hand out. CAIN                                           (cont'd) Beat it, you filthy beggar! \nOH You can't blame people for being hungry. \nCAIN Yeah, well, just remember, it's the palace that pays you, not the people. \nOfficial White                                                             71. Suddenly, they hear a regal fanfare of approaching trumpets and turn to look. At the sound of the trumpets EVERYONE IN THE CROWDED SQUARE falls to the ground and prostrates himself. Cain pulls Oh to the ground but Zed is left standing there oblivious as the ROYAL ENTOURAGE approaches. Oh taps on Zed's leg trying to get his attention, but Zed just ignores it, too transfixed to notice that he's the only one standing. EIGHT STRONG MALE SLAVES enter the square carrying an ornately decorated litter shaded with a silk canopy. On it is the PRINCESS INANNA, a stunning young woman, richly dressed and bejeweled, with exotic eyes and luscious red lips. A HANDMAIDEN rides along fanning her with a big ostrich plume fan. Zed sees the Princess and is instantly taken with her beauty. Princess Inanna glances his way and can't help but notice he's the only person in the square still standing. She gives him a quizzical smile, then turns away imperiously. As the litter passes, her handmaiden continues to stare at Zed. He doesn't recognize her, but we do. It's Maya, now elaborately costumed and made-up. Zed gawks at the Princess, then suddenly a ROYAL GUARD knocks him to the ground and stands on his neck as the rest of the entourage passes. \nZED (on the ground, excitedly to Oh) Did you see that girl? I think she liked me! She looked right at me. \nOH Gee, I wonder why? The royal guard takes his foot off Zed's neck and they all get back to their feet. \nZED Who was she? \nCAIN The Princess Inanna. She's totally hot, but don't even think about it. \nOfficial White                                                                                       72. \nZED Why not? \nCAIN Because she's royalty and you're scum? The entire crowd starts moving in the same direction as the royal entourage. \nOH Where's everybody going? \nCAIN To the temple. Let's go. (starts walking) You have to see this. \nZED \nOfficial White                                                            76. \nZED What's happening? \nGUY He's picking a virgin. \nCAIN \n(LASCIVIOUS) Oh yeah. Uh huh. Uh huh. \nAT THE ALTAR the High Priest is moving down the line of beautiful young maidens. He comes to one SLUTTY GIRL who seems so obviously not a virgin, he does a double take and kicks her out of the line. \nZED AND OH watching curiously. \nZED What do they want a virgin for? \nGUY To throw into the fire. \nZED \n(SHOCKED) Why? \nGUY (like talking to an idiot) Offering to the Gods. There's a famine going on. If we don't make a good sacrifice, it won't rain. No rain, no harvest. No harvest, no food. Get it? \nCAIN It's pretty self-explanatory. \nOH You throw the virgin in the fire so it'll rain? \nGUY Duh. \nZED Seems like a waste of a perfectly good virgin to me. \nOfficial white                                                             77. \nOH \n(CONCERNED) These virgins-- it's always a girl, right? \nAT THE ALTAR A great cheer goes up as a girl is chosen. She swoons as the priestesses slip off her vestment and two priests escort her to the fiery mouth of the furnace. \nHIGH PRIEST For the love of the Gods and the glory of their Creation, the great dome of Heaven, the green growing Earth, we commit this maiden to your Holy Fire. Another great cheer from the crowd as they throw her into the fire. \nZED \n(APPALLED) This is just crazy. Maya approaches them but Zed and Oh still don't recognize her. \nMAYA (eyes downcast) The Princess wishes to see you. \nCAIN (staring at her cleavage) Her wish is my command. \nMAYA Not you. Him. (points at Zed) \nZED Me? Cool. (then, motioning to Oh) We're kind of a package deal. Can he come with? \nCAIN The three of us are inseparable. We're like brothers. Cain squeezes both their shoulders and gives Maya an artificial smile. \nOfficial White                                                              78. Maya ignores Cain and points to Zed and Oh. \nMAYA The two of you follow me. \nZED (to Cain) I'll try to put in a good word for you. Cain fumes as Zed and Oh head off with Maya. \nCUT TO: \n47                                                            EXT. PALACE   - LATER \nA SQUAD OF SENTRIES stands guard at the massive iron palace gates. A CROWD OF BEGGARS is pressed against the gate pleading for food. Zed and Oh approach led by Maya.

(to Oh and Eema) You two await me. (then confidentially to Eema and Oh) Stay out of trouble. I'll be back. He exits with Maya. \nEEMA He has no idea what he's doing, does he? \nOH I don't know. So much has happened. Sometimes I think-- She walks away.

Oh walks by still painted gold. \nHIGH PRIEST (to Oh) You there! Golden boy! Rub me with oil. The High Priest dismisses the young men, then stands and lets his rich outer robe fall to the floor. His chest, back and shoulders are incredibly hairy. \nOH I'd rather not, if you don't mind. I'm not really a slave. I'm a guard. \nHIGH PRIEST Then maybe you'd rather I speak to your commander and have you whipped to within an inch of your life. Or perhaps I whip you myself? How would you like that? \nOH Are those my choices? \nOfficial White                                                           89. \nHIGH PRIEST I'd say so. The High Priest lies back down. Oh looks around, finds a pitcher filled with precious oil and dribbles some on the High Priest's hairy chest. \nOH How's that? \nHIGH PRIEST More. \nOH (splashes a few more drops on him) That enough? \nHIGH PRIEST (getting angry) No! More oil! Much more, you insolent dolt! Oh pours oil liberally over his chest, back, and shoulders. HIGH PRIEST                                                   (cont'd) That's good. Now rub it in. \nOH \n(APPALLED) With my hands? \nHIGH PRIEST Do it! Oh grimaces and starts gingerly massaging the oil into his hairy chest and shoulders. HIGH PRIEST                                                   (cont'd) (in ecstasy) Mmmmm, I love it. The sweet scent of precious oil. The oily-- oiliness. Eema walks by with a pitcher of wine and sees Oh massaging the High Priest. She gasps. \nOH \n(EMBARRASSED) Eema!

This really explains a lot about you that I didn't get before. \nOH No, really! I'm just-- rubbing oil on this man. She exits. \nHIGH PRIEST Mnum imam. I have an idea. Why don't we go back to my place and see what's under all that paint? \nOH \n(DISGUSTED) Ughh. \nCUT TO: \n53                                                           INT. PRINCESS'S CHAMBER - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER   53 \nMaya ushers Zed into the dimly lit room. \nMAYA Good luck. \nOH That's so-- unselfish of you. \nHIGH PRIEST Yes, it is. It's just so-- lonely. Sometimes i hunger for the touch of another human being. \n(COY) Here's a riddle: what has two thumbs and wants another oil rub? (pointing thumbs at \nHIMSELF) This-guy. Ohquickly changes the subject. \nOH So where does that hall lead to? \nHIGH PRIEST (his eyes light up) Come, I'll show you. He takes Oh's arm and leads him down the hail toward a set of incredibly impressive doors covered with cuneiform writing and arcane religious symbols. HIGH PRIEST                                                     (cont'd) Behind those doors is the Holy of Holies-- the earthly domain of the \n(MORE) \nOfficial White HIGH PRIEST                           (cont'd) Gods-- a place so ineffably sacred, so powerful, that to enter is instant death for any mortal. \nOH Wow. (a long beat) So who cleans it? \nHIGH PRIEST it needs no cleaning. \nOH No, of course not. (can't let go of it) Kind of makes you wonder though-- the guys who built it, did they just die the minute they finished, or did the Gods give them a second to get out? \nHIGH PRIEST (starting to get annoyed) I assume they finished it, then the Gods descended. \nOH Yeah, that's probably it. (another long beat) So you're saying we can't go in? \nHIGH PRIEST I just told you! To enter is instant death! Only I can go in and only once a year after very elaborate purification rituals and days of special prayers and offerings. \nOH \n(QUICKLY) Right, right, right. \n(BEAT) What if we just open the doors and stick our heads in? \nHIGH PRIEST Fine! Enough! I'm sorry I brought it up. Let's go. (pushes Oh along) Move. Move.

Finally. Now you're talking! Should I enter it right here or should we go back to your bedroom? Does the Holy of Holies like to be entered from behind or--? \nINANNA \n(POINTS) That's the Holy of Holies-- you have to go in there and talk to the Gods. \nZED The Gods are in there? \nINANNA So they say, but the only one who ever goes in is the High Priest. They say it's instant death for anyone else to enter. \nZED Then why am I going in? \nINANNA \n(IMPATIENT) Because you were chosen? If the Gods wanted you dead they would have killed you already. \nZED \nRIGHT-- \nINANNA This is what you've been chosen for! To speak to the Gods and plead with them not to destroy the city. Then come back out and tell me what it's like inside. \nOfficial White                                                                        96. \nOfficial White                                                           100. \nOH What have you done for me? I've been attacked by a cougar, I've fallen down a mountain, I almost had the tip of my thingy cut off, I've been greasing up the High Priest all night, and now I'm hanging upside down in a dungeon. And I have to pee real bad. All because of you. You call yourself a friend? Name one good thing you've done for me. \nZED I've helped you come out of your shell. \nOH (in distress) I really have to pee-- \nZED Listen, I know I'm not perfect, and I may have made a few wrong turns, but you have to understand-- I'm a chosen. That's a lot of responsibility -- you can't even imagine. \nOH \n(ANGRY) The only one who thinks you're chosen is you, so shut up already! \nZED \n(STUNG) Okay, be mad, but I'm going to get us out of here, if it's the last thing I do. Zed starts frantically yanking on his shackles to no avail.

Because he's upside down, the streams runs down his stomach, over his chest, down his neck, onto his chin and over his face.

PUBLIC SQUARE - EARLY MORNING \nA curious, jeering MOB is gathering as Zed and Oh, in shackles, are led by a SQUAD OF GUARDS to a raised platform in the middle of the square. The heavy pounding of martial drums silences the crowd. Cain presides over the execution. He addresses the crowd. \nCAIN For the crimes of blasphemy-- (the crowd grumbles its \nDISAPPROVAL) \nHERESY-- (grumble, grumble) \nCONSPIRACY-- (serious grumbling) \nSODOMY-- (admiring oohs and aahs) And the murder of my brother Abel-- \nZED Oh, come on! \nCAIN Shut up! For these and other crimes they may not actually have done yet but we're pretty sure they were thinking about, the prisoners will be stoned to death. The crowd roars as GUARDS stationed around the square pull canvas covers off big baskets of rocks and the people rush to grab stones to throw. Zed and Oh instinctively move closer to each other. \nPALACE BALCONY The King, Queen, High Priest and Royal Ministers observe the stoning from their vantage point above the square. Princess Inanna refuses to look. \nOfficial White                                                             102. \nKING Observe, my dear. It seems the least you could do, since it was you who lured him to his death. She reluctantly turns and looks at Zed. \nINANNA I didn't intend for this to happen. \nTHE SQUARE The people move in and surround the platform on all sides, baseball-size rocks in their hands. \nCAIN (to Zed and Oh) Anything to say before the sentence is carried out? \nZED (to the crowd) I just want to say this is really messed up-- \nCAIN \nOKAY-- \n(SHOUTS) \nSTONE THEM! The people fling their rocks with all their might. Zed and Oh duck. The rocks fly over their heads and hit people in the crowd on the opposite sides, several bystanders taking painful hits in the head, some falling down unconscious. Cain notes the impracticality of having people throw rocks from all directions. CAIN                                                            (cont'd) Okay! Stop! Halt! Hold it!

TEMPLE SQUARE - SAME TIME   69 \nOh and the slaves are confined behind a barrier, watched by a squad of guards, waiting for the ceremony to start. THE TEMPLE DOORS open slowly, and the High Priest appears holding a long jewelled staff. Oh turns to the EDOMITE SLAVE next to him. \nOH (casually name-dropping) See the High Priest? I know him. Dear friend of mine. \nTHE TEMPLE Now the procession of SACRIFICIAL VIRGINS is led out by the HIGH PRIESTESS. Maya and Eema are among them, their hands tied. They look like they've been drugged. Oh spots Eema and Maya among the virgins. \nOfficial White                                                                        114. \nOH \n(PANICKED) That's Eema! And Maya! I know them! \nEDOMITE SLAVE \n(SARCASTIC) I guess you know everybody, don't you. Oh shoulders his way right up to the barrier where a BIG GUARD stops him with a spear to his neck. \nBIG GUARD That's far enough, slave. Oh stops right there, frustrated and frightened. \nTHE TEMPLE Inanna is led out last, now also having been drugged. \n70                                                              TOP OF THE ZIGGURAT   70 Zed, Marlak and the sharp-eyed Enmebaragesi look down, trying to see what's going on. \nENMEBARAGESI They're bringing out the women. \nZED \n(AMAZED) How are you seeing that far? \nENMEBARAGESI I see your sister, Eema-- \nTOP OF THE ZIGGURAT \nZED \n(SQUINTING) It's Maya! \nCUT TO: \n71                                                              THE TEMPLE            71 The drums and trumpets kick up the tempo and the High Priest starts leading the virgins to the idol's fiery mouth. Oh pushes against the barrier, restrained by the guard. \nOfficial White                                                                        115. \nOH We have to do something! Somebody has to stop it. (turning to the other \nSLAVES) We can't let them do this! The slaves start to mutter. The guards draw their swords and heft their spears, now on high alert. \nCUT TO: \n72                                                              TOP OF THE ZIGGURAT   72 Zed looks around desperately, trying to figure out what to do. \nZED (to Marlak) I have to get down there. \nGUARD #2 \n(SNORTS) Over my dead body. \nMARLAK All right. Without a moment's hesitation, Marlak grabs him and tosses him off the top of the ziggurat. He screams all the way down. \nZED Wow. Who saw that coming? Thanks, Marlak. \nMARLAK Now what? Zed looks around quickly, grabs the end of a long coiled rope attached to a big pulley, and hands Marlak the other end. \nZED (looping the rope around his waist) Lower me down. Without waiting for a response, Zed bravely jumps off the top of the ziggurat holding the rope. \nOfficial White                                                                   116. Marlak looks at the rope in his hands, pulls it a little and sees that it's not attached to the rope Zed was holding. \nHIGH PRIEST (cupping his ear) What did you say? \nZED \n(SHOUTS) I said, 'I don't think so!' \nHIGH PRIEST (shakes his head) Still not getting it. Zed rolls his eyes in frustration and starts tentatively climbing down from the top of the idol. He jumps the last few feet and lands right in front of the fire, blocking the High Priest's way. \nZED I Said, 'I don't think so.' \nHIGH PRIEST \n(CONFUSED) You don't think what? \nZED Whatever that last thing you said was. \nHIGH PRIEST \n(THINKS) I forgot. \n(SHOUTS) Guards! \nOfficial White                                                                            120. Guards rush toward Zed from all sides, but he fights like a demon, slashing, spinning, stabbing, fending off their blows with his shield. Oh is inspired by Zed's courage. \nOH (to the Edomite slave) I know him, too. Oh springs into action, attacking the big guard in front of him. The other slaves see that and start fighting with their guards, a genuine slave revolt. \nTHE CROWD Guards start moving to help their comrades, but the spirit of insurrection takes hold of the crowd and people start grappling with the guards. A PLATOON OF REINFORCEMENTS comes double-timing into the square. Suddenly, A STOOPED OLD MAN throws off his cloak and pulls a sword. It's Abraham! \nABRAHAM Death to the idolators! Abraham's small army of HEBREWS reveal themselves, draw their weapons and attack the reinforcements. The last Hebrew to unrobe is Isaac, who just stands there observing the growing chaos. \nISAAC (shaking his head) Just fucking nuts. \n77                                                              MARLAK AND ENMEBARAGESI   77 They come running into the battle swinging clubs, randomly bashing heads of soldiers and innocent civilians alike. Cain sees Marlak and stands his ground. \nCAIN Tough guy, huh? You want a piece of me? Get ready to have your head bashed in! \nOfficial White                                                               121. As Cain raises his truncheon, Marlak HEAD-BUTTS him.

His ministers surround him, he thinks to protect him. \nKING I knew I could depend on your loyalty. The ministers all draw daggers from their robes and move in for the kill.

He fights with very little skill but tremendous energy, finally overwhelming the guard and grabbing Eema. \nOH (suddenly shy again) Hello, Eema. \nEEMA (still a little dazed) Oh? He stares at her full red lips and big blue eyes. \nOH (suddenly forceful) Eema, you're my woman! You hear me? \nEEMA Okay. \nOfficial White                                                                    122. \nOH Really? It's okay? He pulls her into an embrace and kisses her hard on the mouth. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Oh sees a guard rushing at him. Oh whirls and falls off the platform, accidentally cutting the guards legs out from under him. \n80                                                              THE HIGH PRIEST   80 While Zed is busy with the guards, the High Priest pulls Maya toward the fire. Zed sees him, finishes the last of the guards, and starts slowly moving toward the High Priest who starts backing away until he sees Oh moving toward him from the other side. He holds the helpless Maya close to the flames. \nHIGH PRIEST (screaming and crying) Keep away! \nZED Let her go. \nHIGH PRIEST (his mascara running) No! The Gods demand a sacrifice! And you ruined it! He wrestles Maya even closer to the fire. \nZED (trying to keep him calm) Why don't we just sacrifice something small-- a rabbit maybe. Or a duck.

I'm really worried about him. He turns aside and makes a goofy sarcastic face for Oh's benefit. \nADAM You're not coming? \nCAIN Yeah, I am. I just have to finish toiling over here, then I'm right behind you. Adam and the others hurry off, and as soon as they're gone, Cain rushes over and starts harnessing the oxen to the cart.

I have a feeling they're going to try and blame this whole \"Abel- killing-thing\" on you. \nZED Why would they blame us? \nCAIN Because when they find him and his head is all bashed in, they're going to start pointing fingers, and you guys are drifters, so they'll put two and two together and that makes-- He stares expectantly at Zed and Oh.

His hair has been combed and pulled back into a loose ponytail. He stops to admire himself in a mirror. \nZED What do you think, ponytail or no ponytail? You know what? \n(MORE) \nOfficial White              82. ZED                                                           (cont'd) I'll start with the ponytail, see where the night takes me. Maya rolls her eyes and leads Zed to the entrance of the Great Hall. Cain and another guard are posted at the door. ZED                                                           (cont'd) Hey, you made it! What's it like inside? \nCAIN \n(POINTED) I wouldn't know.- I'm just a guard because my \"brother\" didn't pull any strings with his friends in the royal court. \nZED Look, first of all, we're not actually brothers--- \nCAIN Just like Abel. I oughta just bash your head in-- \nZED Hey! You didn't let me finish. As soon as I get in there I'm going to talk to somebody and get you invited, okay? \nCAIN \n(UNCONVINCED) Yeah, sure. Have a nice orgy. Cain pulls open the big doors and Zed steps through the portal. Cain tries to steal peeks inside as the heavy doors slam shut. \nCUT TO: \n51                                                            ZED'S POV        51 A full-scale ORGY is going on in a magnificent hall. As Maya leads him into the room, Zed pulls his hair out of the ponytail. \nZED Feels like a hair-down kinda scene, don't you think? \nOfficial White                                                          83. \nMAYA As you wish. \n(POINTEDLY) Be sure to try the fruit. Zed looks at her and finally recognizes her. \nZED Maya?! What are you doing here? \nMAYA I had no choice. I'm a slave, remember? \nZED I was going to rescue you! Really! In fact, we came here to find you. \nMAYA (not buying it) Wait here until you're sent for. \nZED This wasn't my idea, you know. \nMAYA Of course not. You were just chosen again. Maybe after you and the Princess get together you can start thinking about someone beside yourself. She walks off before he can answer. Zed shakes his head, looks around the room, then STARTS walking past a row of \"LIVING STATUES,\" semi-nude men and women on pedestals covered head to toe in gold body paint, frozen in heroic postures that show off their beautiful bodies. Zed looks closely at one beautiful nude \"GODDESS\", then furtively reaches out and fondles her breast. The goddess slaps his hand, then resumes her pose. \nGODDESS watch it, jerk! \nZED Hey! You're a real girl! That is so cool. \nOfficial White                                                             84. He moves down the row of living sculptures, mugging at them, mock humping, and waving his hands in their faces trying to make them move, but they remain frozen. ZED                                                             (cont'd) Amazing! He comes to the LAST STATUE and does a double-take. This one is wearing only a skimpy cloth diaper and is posed like someone waiting for a bus. He is also painted gold, but unlike the others, he has a little potbelly and round shoulders, and can't seem to hold still for very long, shifting his weight uncomfortably and looking around in obvious embarrassment. ZED                                                             (cont'd) (recognizing him) Oh? Oh looks down from his pedestal. \n", "test2_true": "ZED Yeah, you look so-- gold. How's it going? \nOH How's it going? I just had my whole body painted by a fat guy with no balls, and believe me, he was very thorough, if you know what I mean. How's it going with you? \nZED Not bad. Had a little rub and a scrub, now I'm up for some grub. \nOH That sounds nice-- for you. \nZED Hey! You'll never guess who's here- - Maya! She's working here-- and she looks great! But she's kinda mad at me. Oh scans the great hall looking for her and spots Zed's sister Eema, his crush, come into the room carrying a tray of food. \nOfficial White                                                           85. \nOH There's Eema! Eema has been beautifully groomed and is now dressed as a household slave. She stops to serve some rowdy OFFICERS who take the opportunity to tease and fondle her. She tries to pull away but Sargon, the general, grabs her arm. \nSARGON Stand still, wench! I want to see what's under that skirt. As he starts to lift her hem, she drops the whole tray of food on him. His cohorts laugh. \nEEMA I'm sorry! It was an accident. \nSARGON That was no accident! Sargon grabs her and raises his hand to hit her. Zed steps in quickly. \nZED You! Slave girl! (he pulls her away from \nSARGON) I told you to fetch me more wine! Apologize to this officer--- now! \nEEMA I'm sorry. \nZED Now go-- fetch! Wait by that-- skinny statue. I'll deal with you later. As Eema exits, Zed turns to the officers and shrugs. ZED                                                           (cont'd) Slaves-- what are you gonna do? \nSARGON Try using a hot poker. That they understand. \nZED Ouch. Helpful hint. I will keep that in mind. \nOfficial White                                                          86. Zed bows, then leaves him and joins Eema who is waiting at Oh's pedestal. Zed                                                          (cont'd) What are you doing here? \nEEMA We were sold to the palace. But I won't serve these people! I'd rather die! \nZED Keep that up and you will. \nEEMA What are you doing here? (notices his clothes) Have you joined them? \nOH I haven't joined anything. (re the gold body paint) Does this look like fun? They both look accusingly at Zed. \nZED Okay, I know what you're thinking, but I'm just checking it out. We kept hearing that this place was so evil, but now that I look around I'm thinking maybe it's not all bad. There's a lot to learn here. \nOH What? Like human sacrifice? \nZED No! Like the wheel, for instance! That's pretty awesome-- the way it just goes around in a circle. And farming! And metal-- writing, money, pottery-- hot baths. Come on! Back in the village we thought sharpening a stick was a big breakthrough. \nEEMA (to Oh) What happened to him? \nOfficial White                                                        87. \nZED Look, I think I've been chosen to do something great with my life-- \nOH Here we go again-- \nZED --and I don't think it's hunting wild pigs and weaving baskets. Maya returns for Zed. \nMAYA \n(COOLLY) She wants to see you-- now. \nZED I hope you don't think I'm interested in her. \nMAYA \n(MIFFED) Why would I think that? Just because you couldn't take your eyes off her-- \nZED I'm just using her, Maya! It's part of my plan.

I have a thing going with the princess now-- well, almost had a thing. I'm a slave now-- just like you. \nMARLAK No. You're not just like me. \nZED Okay. We do have our differences-- like about a cup and half of brain tissue-- but that doesn't mean we can't work together. Another GUARD approaches and whacks Marlak with his stick. \nGUARD #2 Take those bricks to the top. The masons are waiting. \nOfficial white                                                           108.

But I should tell you, this isn't really my area.

{"test1_input": "YEAR ONE \nWritten by \nHarold Ramis, Gene Stupnitsky & Lee Eisenberg \nOctober 18th, 2007 \nIN THE BEGINNING...       1 \nBLACK an infinite void but at the center a SINGULARITY, a particle infinitely small and infinitely dense that contains all the potential matter and energy in the universe. \nTHE BIG BANG A blinding flash of light as the singularity explodes, particles expanding in all directions until they fill the screen, a shimmering cloud of electromagnetic dust. Then the particles start to attract one another to form atoms, the atoms elements, the elements form molecules, the molecules compounds, the compounds cells, then a cell twitches and a PRIMITIVE DRUM starts booming out a Dolby heartbeat as we witness the rapid evolution of organisms. Then a big fish swims by and is suddenly swallowed whole by a much bigger fish, and we rapidly rise from the depths and pull back to reveal-- \nTHE SEA                   2 Vast, blue, rolling toward the shore, brilliant sun rising in a cloudless azure sky. A WOMAN emerges from the sea like Aphrodite, strongly backlit to obscure her nudity, but we can see she is full-breasted, long-limbed, toned and tanned-- perfection. Then a MAN rises up out of the water beside her, and staggers clumsily in the surf. Even in silhouette we can see he's far from perfect-- short, overweight. They turn to each other and embrace. It's paradise-- for him. \nTHE WOMAN (looking deep in his eyes) I'm so hungry. \nTHE MAN (wanting her) Yeah. Me, too. The DRUMS get hotter as he closes his eyes and leans in to kiss her, but she turns and walks away. \nWOMAN What should we eat? \nTHE MAN Oh, you actually meant you were hungry. I thought-- forget it. \nOfficial White                                                     2. He follows her. They walk toward the trees that fringe the beach. When they reach the line of vegetation, the woman, MAYA, kneels, pulls berries from a bush and pops them in her mouth. The man, ZED, grabs a handful of berries and they squat there noshing like Adam and Eve. \nTHE WOMAN Mmmm, these are so good. \nTHE MAN Mmrrunm, they really are . When she turns away he spits them out in disgust. Maya smiles and puts her face very close to his, their lips almost touching. \nMAYA (very sexy) You know what I'd really like? \nZED \n(HOPEFULLY) What? \nMAYA Some fruit. \nZED (frustrated, but hanging \nIN                                                              ) Yeah, fruit's good. (he stands up) You want an apple or a pear? \nMAYA \n(THINKS) No. He scans the nearby trees. \nZED Orange? Tangerine? (she shakes her head) Umm, mango? Kiwi? Peach? She shakes her head coyly. He starts darting from tree to tree, hopefully pointing out various options. She follows him. \nOfficial White                                                      3.

Lime? Kumquat? Uh, cock? Cockfruit? \nMAYA \nNOOO-- The game is no longer cute but he still plays along. \nZED Watermelon? Honeydew? Grapes? \nMAYA \nNOOO-- \nZED (this is a lot of work to get laid) Starfruit, casaba-- tangelo? \nMAYA Nope. \n", "test1_true": "ANYMORE) Okay, I give up. Which fruit do you want? \nMAYA \n(POINTS) That one. Zed looks. It's a beautiful tree with lush, apple-like   red fruit hanging from it. \nZED \n(SCOFFS) Yeah, right. Okay. \nMAYA Why not? \nOfficial white                                                           4. \nZED Because that's the fruit we don't eat! It's forbidden. \nMAYA Why not? \nZED Because we don't! It's a rule! That's the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. You don't eat from that one. Nobody ever has. \nMAYA Why not? \nZED Stop saying why not! I told you-- it's a rule. \nMAYA So do you always follow the rules? \nZED No-- yeah-- I don't know. We don't have that many rules. In fact, we only have one rule-- DON'T EAT THAT \nFRUIT. \nMAYA Okay, fine. We won't. Forget I mentioned it. I understand if you're afraid-- \nZED I'm not \"afraid\"-- \nMAYA No, really, it's all right. I just thought you might be curious why we can eat everything else that walks, crawls, swims, flies, or grows in the ground, but not that particular fruit. And I thought you might be the kind of man who's willing to take a chance and start thinking for himself, but I guess I was wrong. She glares defiantly at Zed, then starts to walk away. It's not Paradise anymore. Then like every man that ever lived and will ever live, he caves. \nOfficial White                                                             5. \nZED Okay! Fine! You want to try the Good and Evil fruit, you got it. He rips two ripe fruits from a low-hanging bough and hands her one. They both stare at the fruit. \nMAYA You first. \nZED No way! It was your idea. You go first. \nMAYA We both bite at the same time. Zed considers for a long moment then decides. \nZED Okay. Ready? One-- two-- three! Zed chomps down hard and takes a big bite, but Maya fakes him out and stops before her teeth break the skin. ZED                                                             (cont'd) (with his mouth full) Got me. That's a good move. I'm going to steal it. He starts chewing and she watches as he gets his first taste of Good and Evil. Then his face contorts in disgust and he spits it out. ZED                                                             (cont'd) (gagging and spitting) Yuchh! That's horrible. Yecch, ptui! Ughh. He frantically wipes the inside of his mouth with his fingers, trying to get the terrible taste out. \nMAYA So you're saying it's not good? \nZED Yes! I'm saying it's not good! He grabs his belly as his stomach starts to cramp. Then a loud bowel sound and his eyebrows shoot up. ZED                                                             (cont'd) Oh, no-- \nOfficial White He runs for the bushes. Maya's attention gets diverted. \nMAYA (noticing something) Ooh, banana! \nCUT TO: \n3                                                               EXT. VILLAGE - DAY \nA TRIBE OF PRIMITIVE CAUCASIANS. Dozens of huts surround a mmunal fire pit where WOMEN in loincloths roll flatbread        CO and cook it on heated rocks. The drums start pounding out a celebratory rhythm as the HUNTERS enter carrying a DEAD BOAR on a pole, their faces marked with boar's blood, ritual signs in honor of the kill. The lead hunter MARLAK, is a hulking thug with a bony, Neanderthal forehead. He cuts off the boar's head and drops it at Maya's feet. \nMARLAK (blunt grunt) For you. \nMAYA (forces a grateful smile) Thank you, Marlak. \n4                                                               ZED'S HUT Zed is lying on a pad of animal hides in front of his hut, his guts still aching. His best friend OH sits next to him sewing skins together, watching the hunters with envy, jealous of the attention they're getting from the women. If Zed is over-confident and reckless, Oh is his polar opposite, nervous and risk-averse, the kind of guy who would apologize if you poked him in the ass with your spear. He may, in fact, be near-sighted and if glasses had been invented he'd be wearing them. \nOH \n", "test1_id": 807, "test2_input": "Official White                                                           100. \nOH What have you done for me? I've been attacked by a cougar, I've fallen down a mountain, I almost had the tip of my thingy cut off, I've been greasing up the High Priest all night, and now I'm hanging upside down in a dungeon. And I have to pee real bad. All because of you. You call yourself a friend? Name one good thing you've done for me. \nZED I've helped you come out of your shell. \nOH (in distress) I really have to pee-- \nZED Listen, I know I'm not perfect, and I may have made a few wrong turns, but you have to understand-- I'm a chosen. That's a lot of responsibility -- you can't even imagine. \nOH \n(ANGRY) The only one who thinks you're chosen is you, so shut up already! \nZED \n(STUNG) Okay, be mad, but I'm going to get us out of here, if it's the last thing I do. Zed starts frantically yanking on his shackles to no avail. ZED                                                           (cont'd) That was just my first idea-- and I'm also accepting ideas. \nOH \n(SHOUTS) Guard! I have to pee! Now! Seriously! (can't hold it anymore) Oh, no-- \nOfficial White                                                                                       101. Because he's upside down, the streams runs down his stomach, over his chest, down his neck, onto his chin and over his face. OH                                                              (cont'd) I hate you. \nCUT TO: \n61                                                              EXT. PUBLIC SQUARE - EARLY MORNING \nA curious, jeering MOB is gathering as Zed and Oh, in shackles, are led by a SQUAD OF GUARDS to a raised platform in the middle of the square. The heavy pounding of martial drums silences the crowd. Cain presides over the execution. He addresses the crowd. \nCAIN For the crimes of blasphemy-- (the crowd grumbles its \nDISAPPROVAL) \nHERESY-- (grumble, grumble) \nCONSPIRACY-- (serious grumbling) \nSODOMY-- (admiring oohs and aahs) And the murder of my brother Abel-- \nZED Oh, come on! \nCAIN Shut up! For these and other crimes they may not actually have done yet but we're pretty sure they were thinking about, the prisoners will be stoned to death. The crowd roars as GUARDS stationed around the square pull canvas covers off big baskets of rocks and the people rush to grab stones to throw. Zed and Oh instinctively move closer to each other. \nPALACE BALCONY The King, Queen, High Priest and Royal Ministers observe the stoning from their vantage point above the square. Princess Inanna refuses to look. \nOfficial White                                                             102. \nKING Observe, my dear. It seems the least you could do, since it was you who lured him to his death. She reluctantly turns and looks at Zed. \nINANNA I didn't intend for this to happen. \nTHE SQUARE The people move in and surround the platform on all sides, baseball-size rocks in their hands. \nCAIN (to Zed and Oh) Anything to say before the sentence is carried out? \nZED (to the crowd) I just want to say this is really messed up-- \nCAIN \nOKAY-- \n(SHOUTS) \nSTONE THEM! The people fling their rocks with all their might. Zed and Oh duck. The rocks fly over their heads and hit people in the crowd on the opposite sides, several bystanders taking painful hits in the head, some falling down unconscious. Cain notes the impracticality of having people throw rocks from all directions. CAIN                                                            (cont'd) Okay! Stop! Halt! Hold it! This isn't working. \nZED Can I make a suggestion? \nCAIN \n", "test2_true": "Official White                                                             103. \nZED Why don't you just pick one person to throw? The crowd thinks that's not a bad idea and murmurs agreement. ZED                                                             (cont'd) (pressing the advantage) In fact, don't you think it would be fair for us to get to pick the person who stones us? Cain looks doubtful, but the crowd thinks this is eminently fair. \nCROWD (some eagerly raising their hands and waving like school children) Yes! Ooh, me! Pick me! Me! \nON THE BALCONY The King grabs Sargon. \nKING (re Cain) What is that idiot doing? \nIN THE SQUARE Zed spots a good candidate in the crowd. \nZED We pick him! Cain points at a BIG GUY, heavily muscled, eagerly waving his hand. \nCAIN Him? \nZED No, next to him! He points at a BOY, about nine years old and not very big. \nCAIN He's just a kid! \nOfficial White                                                             104. \nZED So? You got something against kids? Zed plays the crowd which starts booing in disapproval. ZED                                                             (cont'd) This guy hates kids! \nCROWD Yeah! What's he got against kids? Children are the future! Give the kid a shot! The kid! The kid! On the balcony, the King shifts uncomfortably, intimidated by the power of the mob. He nods to Sargon who signals to Cain. \nCAIN All right! All right! We'll try it. Kid! Grab a rock. The boy picks up a good-size rock. Zed turns to Oh. \nZED Good thinking, huh? They turn to face the boy, ready to dodge when he throws. The boy winds up and fires a major league fastball that smacks Oh right on the forehead. The crowd cheers. ZED                                                             (cont'd) Holy shit! That kid's got an arm! \nOH \n(DAZED) I think he hit me. The boy fires again. Oh spins and tries to duck but takes the rock right on the head. OH                                                              (cont'd) Hey! There's two of us! The crowd cheers and pats the kid on the back. \nCAIN Okay, everybody on this side now! On the count of three! One-- two-- \nOfficial white                                                            105. \nZED Wait! I have a question for the King! The crowd goes silent. All eyes turn and look up to the palace balcony. ZED                                                            (cont'd) (shouts to the King) Why didn't I die in the Holy of Holies? On the balcony, everyone is totally stopped by his question. One by one they all look to the High Priest who seems to be stumped. In the square, the crowd starts muttering. Zed seizes the initiative. ZED                                                            (cont'd) I entered the Holy of Holies and, lo, I did not die! Why? Because I am chosen by the Gods! \nPEOPLE IN THE CROWD He is chosen! He is the Chosen One. The Chosen One! Zed gives Oh a look: \"See? I told you.\" \nTHE CROWD (starts chanting) Spare the Chosen One! Spare the Chosen One! Spare the Chosen One! \nOH And his friend! Don't forget his friend! On the balcony, the King and his ministers hastily confer with the High Priest. \nKING Could it be? Is he truly chosen? \nHIGH PRIEST I don't-- I suppose it's possible- I'd have to examine some new \nINTESTINES-- \nKING Imbecile! \nOfficial White                                                                            106. \nPRIME MINISTER Majesty, with respect, whether he's chosen or not is no longer the issue. To kill him now, given the public mood, could inflame the situation enough to prompt a radical \"regime change,\" if you take my meaning. The King looks grimly at his ministers, all of whom have lean and hungry looks. Princess Inanna smiles contemptuously at him. \nCUT TO: \n62                                                              SARGON \naddressing the crowd in the square. \nSARGON By order of the King, the sentence has been commuted. The crowd cheers. Zed and Oh exchange hopeful looks. \nCAIN \n(PLAINTIVE) Can't we just stone them a little? \n", "test2_id": 808, "test3_input": "HIGH PRIEST (cupping his ear) What did you say? \nZED \n(SHOUTS) I said, 'I don't think so!' \nHIGH PRIEST (shakes his head) Still not getting it. Zed rolls his eyes in frustration and starts tentatively climbing down from the top of the idol. He jumps the last few feet and lands right in front of the fire, blocking the High Priest's way. \nZED I Said, 'I don't think so.' \nHIGH PRIEST \n(CONFUSED) You don't think what? \nZED Whatever that last thing you said was. \nHIGH PRIEST \n(THINKS) I forgot. \n(SHOUTS) Guards! \nOfficial White                                                                            120. Guards rush toward Zed from all sides, but he fights like a demon, slashing, spinning, stabbing, fending off their blows with his shield. Oh is inspired by Zed's courage. \nOH (to the Edomite slave) I know him, too. Oh springs into action, attacking the big guard in front of him. The other slaves see that and start fighting with their guards, a genuine slave revolt. \nTHE CROWD Guards start moving to help their comrades, but the spirit of insurrection takes hold of the crowd and people start grappling with the guards. A PLATOON OF REINFORCEMENTS comes double-timing into the square. Suddenly, A STOOPED OLD MAN throws off his cloak and pulls a sword. It's Abraham! \nABRAHAM Death to the idolators! Abraham's small army of HEBREWS reveal themselves, draw their weapons and attack the reinforcements. The last Hebrew to unrobe is Isaac, who just stands there observing the growing chaos. \nISAAC (shaking his head) Just fucking nuts. \n77                                                              MARLAK AND ENMEBARAGESI   77 They come running into the battle swinging clubs, randomly bashing heads of soldiers and innocent civilians alike. Cain sees Marlak and stands his ground. \nCAIN Tough guy, huh? You want a piece of me? Get ready to have your head bashed in! \nOfficial White                                                               121. As Cain raises his truncheon, Marlak HEAD-BUTTS him. CAIN                                                            (cont'd) (nose bleeding, stunned) Nice move!

His ministers surround him, he thinks to protect him. \nKING I knew I could depend on your loyalty. The ministers all draw daggers from their robes and move in for the kill. KING                                                            (cont'd) \n(MUTTERS) Assholes.

He fights with very little skill but tremendous energy, finally overwhelming the guard and grabbing Eema. \nOH (suddenly shy again) Hello, Eema. \nEEMA (still a little dazed) Oh? He stares at her full red lips and big blue eyes. \nOH (suddenly forceful) Eema, you're my woman! You hear me? \nEEMA Okay. \nOfficial White                                                                    122. \nOH Really? It's okay? He pulls her into an embrace and kisses her hard on the mouth. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Oh sees a guard rushing at him. Oh whirls and falls off the platform, accidentally cutting the guards legs out from under him. \n80                                                              THE HIGH PRIEST   80 While Zed is busy with the guards, the High Priest pulls Maya toward the fire. Zed sees him, finishes the last of the guards, and starts slowly moving toward the High Priest who starts backing away until he sees Oh moving toward him from the other side. He holds the helpless Maya close to the flames. \nHIGH PRIEST (screaming and crying) Keep away! \nZED Let her go. \nHIGH PRIEST (his mascara running) No! The Gods demand a sacrifice! And you ruined it! He wrestles Maya even closer to the fire. \nZED (trying to keep him calm) Why don't we just sacrifice something small-- a rabbit maybe. Or a duck. That'd be good, don't you think? \nHIGH PRIEST \n", "test3_true": "OH                                                              (U.S.) Then how about this? The High Priest turns to Oh. Oh is holding the big sacramental pitcher. OH                                                              (cont'd) More oil? \nOfficial White                                                             123. He splashes the High Priest with a gallon of oil, soaking him from head to toe. As the oil hits the High Priest, Zed dashes across and snatches Maya from his grasp. The High Priest spins around in a rage, his long robes wrap around his legs hobbling him, he totters on his high platform shoes, loses his balance and gets too close to the idol's fiery mouth. Totally drenched in oil, he bursts into flame like a human torch, screams, and staggers right into the mouth of the furnace. \nHIGH PRIEST \n(SCREAMS) Hot! \nTEMPLE SQUARE Everyone goes silent, stunned by the incredible turn of events. All eyes turn to Zed and Oh, now standing before them on the center stage of the temple. \nZED AND OH They look at each other. Someone has to say something. Finally, Zed clears his throat. \nZED I'm the, uh, Chosen One, I guess, and on behalf of, well, the whole city, I want to thank the High Priest for his incredible sacrifice. That was really something, wasn't it? He starts clapping, then Oh starts clapping, and soon all the people in the square are applauding. At that moment a single drop of rain falls and hits Zed in the eye. He looks up, a few more drops, then a hard steady rain starts to fall. The people all look up in awe, then someone cheers and they all roar in celebration. Then the rain stops as suddenly as it started. The cheers die away, and confused, dissatisfied muttering begins. ZED                                                             (cont'd) (jumping in quickly) People! Friends! Sodomites! Okay, that was a little confusing, wasn't it? \n(MORE) \nOfficial White              124. ZED                                                           (cont'd) Was that a sign from God? Wasn't it a sign? What's the deal? We all want to know. But I'm not sure anybody really knows-- and I'd be real suspicious of people who say they do. If I've learned one thing, it's this: the world and everything in it is a miracle. And what that miracle means is for each and every one of us to figure out for himself. Are the Gods going to destroy us? Maybe-- I don't know-- I guess it's possible. But if we keep going the way we are, they won't have to. We're doing a pretty good job of destroying ourselves. So maybe we should all just go home now, and think about what happened-- and be very, very good to each other. I know I'm going to try. (raises his hand in salute to the people) Peace. The crowd stares at him blankly. Nobody knows what to make of it all. Then Marlak shouts loud enough for all to hear. \nMARLAK All hail the Chosen One! With that the crowd explodes into rousing cheers. In the midst of the crowd, Abraham looks around and scowls. \nABRAHAM What am I? Chopped liver? At the altar, Maya, revived now, embraces Zed. \nMAYA You're incredible, you know that? \nZED That's what I've been trying to tell you. Zed and Maya, Oh and Eema stand there basking in the gratitude of the people as Inanna looks on. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nOfficial white                                                                                              125. \n81                                                              EXT. GATES OF THE CITY - A FEW DAYS LATER   81 \nA caravan is assembling, making ready to leave the city. Marlak, Enmebaragesi, Maya, Eema and the other villagers are there, as well as a great number of freed slaves and Hebrews. Isaac is checking out Maya's breasts. \nISAAC Hey, babe. Ever made it with a circumcised guy? Marlak grunts at him and reaches for his knife. ISAAC                                                           (cont'd) \n(BACKPEDALING) Is she with you? I did not realize that. Sorry. Marlak and Maya cross to Zed who is loading a packhorse. Marlak looks at him for a long moment then punches him hard on the shoulder. \nMARLAK \n(GRUDGING) You did good. Zed waits for more, but nothing comes. \nZED (rubbing his shoulder) Well said, Marlak. You really have a way with words. They clasp hands. \nMARLAK We'll tell stories about you around the fire. \nZED Not much to tell, is there? Just an average guy who saw his destiny and had the courage to defy a powerful empire. No big deal. Oh is at the front of the caravan, giving orders, but no one is listening to him. Zed joins him. ZED                                                             (cont'd) Everybody ready? \nOfficial White                                                          126. \nOH \n(WORRIED) Yeah, just about-- I guess so. The Hebrews are going to lead us to the sea and we can get boats from there. We can trade all this stuff everybody gave us for the trip home. \n(NERVOUS) I don't think I should be the leader. Nobody's listening to me. \nEEMA (by his side) I'll listen to you. Oh swells up with pride. \nOH (turns to Zed) Come back to the village sometime. Zed nods, they shake hands, then they embrace. Stifling a tear, Oh breaks away and whips the lead camel. OH                                                           (cont'd) (shouting at camel) Hee-ya! (beat, quietly to camel) Come on. People are watching. The camel looks at him and slowly lumbers off. Oh sighs gratefully and signals the caravan to follow. As the great caravan moves off, Zed is left standing there with nothing but a long staff, and a bundle on the ground beside him to which is tied his sword, shield and helmet. Maya joins him. \nMAYA Where will you go now? \nZED Might head down to Egypt. I hear it's a happening kinda place. \nMAYA Are you going alone? \nZED Not necessarily. You want to come? \nOfficial White                                                             127. \n", "test3_id": 809}

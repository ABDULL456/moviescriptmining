Lucy, don't do this! The girl's just too fast. She keeps pushing him backwards until he's dangerously close to the vampire's clawing hands.. Hick's closes his eyes, knowing this is it... 
A FIST PUNCHES through a BOARDED UP HOLE in the floor (the one through which Lucy escaped before), wood splintering into tiny shards. Hicks takes advantage of the distraction and SLUGS Lucy, knocking her unconscious. He dives for his gun, scooping it up and leveling it at the hole, ready to fire at whatever's coming through... 
IT'S PRIEST He sticks his head through the opening, having been drawn by the sound of gunfire. Hicks can't believe it. 
PRIEST (reaching for Lucy) Give her to me! Hurry! 
Hicks thinks about it, unsure. 
PRIEST (CONT'D) -- They'11.get through the door any second! Give her to mei Screeching, ANOTHER VAMPIRE makes it through the opening, Hicks quickly taking him down in one crack shot. He picks Lucy up, handing her to Priest. Priest disappears with her, Hicks climbing down behind just as -- the chain finally SNAPS and the door BURSTS open with screeching vampires! Hicks BLASTS away but there's too many of them, they keep coming. He drops into the hole -- 
EXT. UNDERNEATH THE TRAIN - CONTINUOUS 
Landing in the undercarriage. Coming face to face with the speeding track, everything shaking like an earthquake. 
A VAMPIRE Jabs its head through the hole, teeth chattering-- but the creature can't go any further, the sunlight already making its skin smoke. On his back, Hicks worms his way down,. following Priest.as they climb up a LADDER attached to the side of the train. 
EXT. TRAIN CONTINUOUS' 
They work their way up the side, making it to the roof, exhausted. Priest carrying the still unconscious Lucy. 
HICKS We should jump! 
PRIEST Not until we stop the trains But now Hicks isn't even looking at him, his attention caught up in the horrible sight waiting ahead of them. 
HICKS 
(SWALLOWS) Too late. 
THE CITYSCAPE 
t Towers above as the train approaches, so close the smell of sulphur and carbon clogs their noses. But that's when something catches Hicks' eye...up ahead on the tracks -- Someone stands. awaiting the train. IT'S THE PRIESTESS -- Standing defiant as the train barrels towards her. An ant in front of a battleship. She sees Hicks and Priest-on top of the train, Lucy with them. Taking one last look at Priest -- she smiles. And spreads her arms open. 
ON PRIEST Horrified, realizing what she's going to do...and powerless to stop her. 
PRIEST What happens next happens fast: Priest GRABS Hicks, folding his body around both he and Lucy, hands coming together in prayer, feet leaving the train as -- E ERYTH ggas BLACK The sound of a heartbeat.A threshold. A zone of transition. A BRIGHT FLASH -- we see the TRAIN collide with the. Priestess. The massive grill of the engine CRUMPLING AROUND HER as if smashing into a building. She doesn't move. A BRIGHT FLASH -- one by one the train cars SLAM into each other, the cars JUMPING the rails. MMMM gQES BLACK A BRIGHT FLASH -- and now Priest is falling through the air, his body shielding Hicks and Lucy, train care skipping across the earth, careening through the air. 
And WHAM! we FUSE back into real time as train cars CRASH down, sheets of dust clouding the sky in a roiling storm of debris and shrapnel, until finally...it all comes to a stop. It's quiet. We move through the swirling sand until we find -- 
PRIEST He stands, bruised and bloody, staring at the sky. Watching. A dazed Hicks beside him, Lucy in his arms as she comes to. A HORRENDOUS SCREECH fills the air. Led by the Purebloods, HUNDREDS OF VAMPIRES fly out from within the broken cars, taking to the sky in a massive black swarm, tangling together in flowing shapes. Beautiful. Terrifying. Then in one horrible instant -- They TURN as if guided by an unseen hand, flying towards the Cities. Sensing the blood that awaits. 
HICKS 
(HORRIFIED) They're gonna make it. The creatures arctowards the metropolis,the city within 
THEIR REACH: Priest studies the sky and all at once...he knows. 
PRIEST No, they're not. 
THE SUN PUNCHES through the teeming mass. A few rays at first, but then more and more,-cracking through the black tide like shattered glass. Hicks' eyes, widen, witnessing an amazing eight as the vampires' bodies collectively BLACKEN and SHRIVEL the swarm withering... quickly becoming nothing more than husks. Floating black kites. Hicks and Priest stand, surrounded by the epic destruction, fire and smoke casting everything in a surreal haze. 
HICKS You knew they wouldn't make it. A long time before Priest answers. 
PRIEST She knew. He turns to THE ENGINE -- its grinning teeth grill CAVED IN as if smashed by the very hand of God. 
THE PRIESTESS Lies before it. Somehow not a scratch on her...But something's wrong -- something inside her broken, something elemental. She doesn't have much time. Priest kneels beside her, taking her hand. Trying to be strong for her. 
PRIEST (CONT'D) Do you want me to?

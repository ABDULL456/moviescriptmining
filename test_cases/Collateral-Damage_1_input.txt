Anne opens the door to find an exhausted Gordy sitting on the floor with their four-year-old son, MATT. They're building a K'nex spaceship. 
MATT Look what we made! 
ANNE Nice rocket... That took a while. 
GORDY He was awake when I got home.   His throat still hurts. 
ANNE Shit. 
MATT That's a bad word. 
GORDY You're right. (CONTINUED) 
18   CONTINUED:                                                        18 
ANNE Sorry. 
She feels Matt's forehead.    Gordy's done it already. 
GORDY No fever. 
ANNE (to Matt) You better see Dr. Bob. (to Gordy) And this time, no opening fire hydrants to play in till he's completely well. 
GORDY Yes, ma'am. 
She leans down and kisses him.      There's passion in it. 
ANNE How was your shift? 
GORDY (shrugs) The usual. 
She yawns.    Starts heading out. 
ANNE Dreamed I did a triple axel in an ice skating championship. 
GORDY (beat; calls after her) Come back and let me see those legs again. 
19   INT. BATHROOM - DAY                                               19 
Gordy holds Matt in his arms as water pours over them. It's the second child he's held in the last few hours. This one is his, this one is safe at home and unafraid: what a father wants for his child. We see the deep affection Gordy has for his son. He holds Matt tightly, skin to skin, and kisses the boy's wet head... 
Anne opens the shower door.       She's on the phone. 
(CONTINUED) 
19   CONTINUED:                                                      19 
ANNE Dr. Bob can squeeze him in at twelve. I have a patient relations meeting at twelve- fifteen. Can you take him? 
GORDY I have a game. But yeah, if we do the handoff at the doctor's. 
ANNE (into phone) Yes, he'll be there... Thanks. (hangs up; to Gordy) Five-of in front of Dr. Bob's. Don't be late. (to Matt) Let's get you out, sweetie. Your father just can't keep you dry. 
She leads Matt out. Closes the shower door. Gordy sticks his face into the water. Looks back, finds... 
Two bare butts, Anne's and Matt's, are pressed against the shower door's foggy glass. OFF Gordy, laughing -- 
20   EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY                    20 
It appears the entire neighborhood's crammed against the chain-link fence around the court, yelling and cheering as a team of local kids from the NYFD Athletic League plays a team of local kids from the NYPD Athletic League. 
Gordy's an NYFD coach, exhorts his team at the top of his lungs. 
The rivalry's intense. The game close.       The noise deafening. Bets are going down. 
NYFD goes up by one in the final minute. 
Gordy disses a cop coaching the opposing team. 
LUIS is one of Gordy's kids. A small but talented fifteen-year-old. Luis steals the ball. Drives for an unguarded lay-up to put the team up by three... And misses. An opponent recovers the ball. The flow shifts toward the other end, but Luis is slow adjusting, devastated at missing the easy "two." Gordy yells at him to defend. 
GORDY Luis, get back! Pick up your man! 
(CONTINUED) 
20   CONTINUED:                                                  20 
Luis shakes it off. Hustles back on "D" as his man gets the ball. The opponent's a step ahead. Goes up... And Luis gets there to reject him. The crowd loves it. The BUZZER SOUNDS. NYFD wins. 
21   SAME SCENE - GORDY AND LUIS - MOMENTS LATER                 21 
In the game's immediate aftermath. NYFD celebrating around them. Gordy's proud of Luis. 
GORDY We lose, win, whatever. But one thing we never do. We never, ever give up. Right? 
OFF Gordy, smiling at Luis... 
22   SAME SCENE - LATER                                          22 
The crowds are gone. Gordy checks his watch and starts off, when a SOUND draws his attention. 
23   GORDY'S POV                                                 23 
Luis walks along the inside of the chain-link fence around the court. A neighborhood gangbanger and his crew match Luis step for step outside the fence, rattling the fence, clearly trying to intimidate him. 
24   BACK TO SCENE                                               24 
Gordy stalks walking toward them.    Calls -- 
GORDY Luis... 
Seeing Gordy approach, the gangbanger and crew drift off. Reaching Luis -- 
GORDY What was that about? 
LUIS Told 'em I wouldn't play with 'em anymore. 
But Gordy sees Luis is scared. And he sees the gangbanger and crew hovering nearby waiting for Gordy to go.

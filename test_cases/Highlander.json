STREET - NIGHT                                               1 \nGarish purple light spills out of side-street porno houses, illuminating a silhouette, and little else, of a MAN leaning against an alley wall. \nHe is waiting. \nAnother silhouetted FIGURE appears and approaches the first. They size each other up as best they can. \nFIRST MAN MacLeod. \nThe second nods. \nThe first without hesitation raises a sword, the intended thrust interrupted by his own death as the second with a flash of metal severs the agressor's head. \n2  INT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              2 \nA 15th century Scottish home. \nA haggard WOMAN, her small CHILD clinging to a tattered apron, stands hunched over a glowing hearth.  Her veined hands drag a wooden spoon around and around through a soot-covered pot of grey soup. \nFrom an adjoining room CONOR MACLEOD, a young man dressed up in his best traditional Celtic tartan, enters. \nMOTHER My, but are you the picture. \nCONOR (surveying himself) It's a bit tight. \nHis FATHER enters with a pail of milk. \nFATHER Ah, Conor, how you look a man. \nMOTHER Have you time for some- thing to eat? \nCONOR No, Mother.  They'll be here shortly. \nConor's father looks him over with pride. \nFATHER Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke. \nMOTHER Must he go? \nFATHER Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours. \nMOTHER But Ian, he's still but a boy. \nFATHER He's a MacLeod. \nCONOR I'll be fine Mother. \n3  EXT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              3 \nSeveral HORSEMEN gallop up through the early morning fog to the cottage door. \nConor's father steps out to meet them. \n4  EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                            4 \nA massive KNIGHT sits astride his horse, moorish dew cling- ing to his helmet and breastplate.  A CLANSMAN hikes up the heather-carpeted slope to him. \nCLANSMAN They march. \nKNIGHT Is the boy among them? \nCLANSMAN Aye. \n5  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                5 \nThe second kneels to examine the headless body of the first. \nWith a CLACK a window, high on the alley wall, closes. \n6  EXT. HIGHLAND PLAIN - MORNING                                     6 \nThe DUKE is leading a brigade of CLANSMEN out onto the plain. Mounted VASSALS ride back and forth inspecting the line.  The low fog makes it impossible to see beyond a few yards.  There is an erie, smothering silence. \nVASSAL #1 Is a bad day for this. \nVASSAL #2 The Duke has been compro- mised.  He will have his due. \nVASSAL #1 By day's end he will have our heads. \nVASSAL #2 We ride against the Suther- lands.  That is all that matters. \nFor the first time we can see his face.  RICHARD TAUPIN, clad in a well-cut business suit, looks exactly like Conor. \nThe police officer, upon seeing the body, grabs instinctively for his pistol.  He yells to his partner now coming into the alley. \nOFFICER #1 Kevin!  Get is a backup. \nTAUPIN I was merely walking by when- \nOFFICER #1 Don't move. \nThe officer has his pistol out and leveled. His partner runs up, shotgun in hand. \nOFFICER #2 They're on their way. \nHis voice cuts short as the blood flows against his shoe. \nOFFICER #2 \nChrist. \n10  INT. HUTCH - NIGHT                                              10 \nConor lies moaning on a cot.  Makeshift bandages wrap his body, stained and pasted by thick, dried blood. \nThe family surrounds their dying son. \nA PRIEST is delivering the last rites. \nPRIEST ...Libera Domine Animan servi tui sicut libertasi David de manu regis Saul... \nHis sobbing mother holds a compress to Conor's forehead. \nPRIEST ...In mamus tuas domine commendo spiritum meum... \n11  EXT. HUTCH - NIGHT                                              11 \nA Vassal rides up to the hutch, dismounts, and approaches a CLANSMAN standing in the open doorway. \nVASSAL #1 Has the boy died? \nCLANSMAN He is having the last rites now.  It should be over by morning. \nVASSAL #1 Never seen anybody cut as bad live so long.  He should have died on the field. \nCLANSMAN Tonight or tomorrow, it's all the same. \nThe Vassal peers inside at the priest administering the sacraments. \nPRIEST ...Auditorium nostrum in nomine domini... \nVASSAL #1 This has been a dark day. \nPRIEST ...Requiescant in pace... \n12  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                              12 \nThere is a bustle of activity.  Setting up barricades, uni- formed OFFICERS are trying to keep NEW CREWS and curious ONLOOKERS at a distance. \nDETECTIVE LT. MORAN \nLean, fortyish, and comfortable with the gore in front of him, is inspecting the corpse with a MEDICAL EXAMINER. \nEXAMINER (studying body) Real clean.  No sawing action at all.  Whatever it was did it in one swipe. (looks up at Moran) Like the other one. \nMoran gestures to a sword, wrapped in plastic, lying nearby. \nMORAN What about that? \nEXAMINER Hasn't any blood on it. \nMORAN (looking around) About the only thing that doesn't. \nEXAMINER I'll give it a closer look when I get back. \nBRENNA CARTWRIGHT \nPretty but not beautiful, thirtyish, she exudes a sort of insolent intelligence. \nAn OFFICER sees her duck under a police barricade. \nOFFICER #3 Come on Brenna, you know better than that. \nBRENNA I'm invited. \nShe walks to where the medical examiner is organizing his equipment. \nBRENNA (greeting) Mr. Levine... \nA lonely, ancient room full of equal parts dust and oaken study tables. \nThe department SUPERVISOR sits at his desk surrounded by a handful of his staff RESEARCHERS - Brenna included.  A faded, stern portrait of some forgotten curator presides over propped up feet, cold coffee, and half eaten sack lunches. \nBRENNA I don't believe him. \nSUPERVISOR Why? \nBRENNA He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it. \nRESEARCHER #1 Oh, has your penetrating research on 9th Century Lithuanian dildos suddenly made you an expert on the criminal mentality? \nBRENNA Screw off, Larry. \nThe men, LAUGH.  They delight in baiting her. Researcher #2 opens a Budweiser and pours the beer into a medieval mug he's borrowed from the collection. \nRESEARCHER #2 The cops bought it.  They let him go. \nBRENNA What could they hold him for?  I think they're just waiting for something concrete before they haul him in for real.  We should look into it.  He had to have gotten that sword from somewhere. \nSUPERVISOR Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here. \nBRENNA I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley? \nRESEARCHER #1 Here we go.  Everytime there's a murder in town we have to put up with junior D.A. \nRESEARCHER #2 Must be genetic. \nBRENNA Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two. \nSUPERVISOR You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it? \nBRENNA Give it a rest Ned, huh? \nRESEARCHER #2 Might be interesting to see what his family connections are.  That's a hell of a piece to be just chuck- ing around in an alley. \nSUPERVISOR (sighs) I swear to God Brenna, between you and Thompson's novels I'm going to get a bloody ulcer. \nResearcher #2 lifts the mug of beer to his mouth. \nCUT TO: \n20  INT. TAVERN                                                     20 \nAn empty mug is set on the counter of a medieval drinking establishment. \nCLANSMEN, their faces and clothes smudged with a day's work in the fields, relax and enjoy the company of their fellow VILLAGERS. \nNo longer requiring the use of a cane, Conor enters. \nCONOR (to owner) Evening, Douglas. \nDOUGLAS Conor. \nThe tavern goes silent.  Wary.  The attention is on Conor. \nCONOR Ale suits me. \nThe owner unenthusiastically fills Conor a mug.  Conor takes it and walks to where four other VILLAGERS sit. \nTAVERN MAN #1 We rather you not be sitting with us, Conor. \nConor looks to the next table. \nTAVERN MAN #2 We be drinking alone as well. \nThe entire tavern spells the same sentiments. \nCONOR What's wrong with you all? \nSilence. \nAngered, Conor approaches the second man.  As he looms above his chair the man in genuine fear pulls out a cross and thrusts it forward. \nTAVERN MAN #2 Requiem acer'nam donaei- \nCONOR What are you doing man? \nTAVERN MAN #2 -Et lux perpetua- \nCONOR You'll not be bringing the church into this. \nTAVERN MAN #2 -Luceat ei- \nThe weird display frightens Conor. \nCONOR Be quiet. \nINTRUDER Smith.  Carl Smith. \nTAUPIN How many came? \nINTRUDER The last four. \nTAUPIN And the Bulgarian? \nINTRUDER He got him. (hoarse chuckle) He always does.  Eventually. \nTAUPIN He knows I'm here.  How? \nINTRUDER None of this would be happening if you hadn't run... \nThe knife is pressed deeper. \nTAUPIN _Answer_ me. \nINTRUDER (gasping) We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill... \n25  EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY                                        25 \nA city limit sign announcing the small community of Church Hill is overtaken by Brenna's sedan. \n26  EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY                        26 \nBrenna looks through a telephone book. \nBRENNA Taupin...Taupin... \nNothing.  She closes the book and drums her fingers on the cover. \n27  EXT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE - DAY                                27 \nAn 1860s stone columned affair, far more impressive than the low-lying town that surrounds it. \nBrenna enters. \n28  INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE                                      28 \nBrenna sits sifting through a large cloth-bound book entitled _Certificates of Birth: 1941-1948_. \nBRENNA (reading) Tarmin...Tatum...Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born to William and Karen Taupin, no address.  Attend- ing physician, Dr. Willis Kidell. \n29  INT. DR. KIDELL'S HOME                                          29 \nDr. Kidell stands at his bookcase leafing through a binder. \nKIDELL 1945, that strains the memory. (after a fashion) Here we are, Richard Taupin. \nHe carries the binder to the table where Brenna sits. \nKIDELL Would you like more tea? \nBRENNA No thank you, I'm fine. \nKidell sips his own and looks over the binder page. \nKIDELL He was unsual. \nBRENNA Why? \nKIDELL Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house. \nBRENNA Then you didn't know Richard later on. \nKIDELL No. \nBRENNA I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies. \nKIDELL Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does. \nBRENNA I don't follow you. \nKIDELL Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born. \nBRENNA The boy _died_? \nKIDELL Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son. \nDr. Kidell removes from the binder a tattered newspaper clipping. \nKIDELL My brother worked for the town paper at the time.  He took this picture of the funeral. \nSomething in the clipping sparks Brenna's interest. \nBRENNA Have you spoken to anyone else about this? \nDETECTIVE MORAN \nIs supervising.  An OFFICER climbs up the embankment to him. \nOFFICER They found it. \nThe officer leads him down to the river where a headless BODY wearing a tuxedo jacket is being put into a plastic bag. \nOFFICER It was about fifty yards down- stream from the head. \nMoran looks down at the body bag, its dark plastic reflecting the rythmic rotation of squad car beacons. \nOFFICER Both were cut real clean.  Like the other ones... \n33  EXT. EQUESTRIAN RIDING GROUNDS - DAY                            33 \nA steeple-chase course lies shrouded in an Arlington fog. \nAcross the damp grass a lone horse, heaving clouds of warm breath, leaps gracefully over a hurdle.  Driving the steed hard through the course, Taupin pulls firm on the reins, bringing horse and rider to a shuddering stop where Detective Moran waits. \nMORAN There's been another murder. \nTaupin lifts his eyes to the suburban treeline. \nTAUPIN My condolences. \nMORAN Where were you Tuesday night? \nTAUPIN Home. \nMORAN A neighbor saw your car leave. \nTAUPIN He's mistaken. \nTaupin climbs down from his horse.  Moran moves close. \nMORAN Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea. \nTAUPIN Do you? \nMORAN All I need is time. \nTAUPIN I've got all the time in the world. (looks at watch) Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant. \nIn no hurry, Taupin leads his horse away. \n34  INT. MUSEUM RESEARCH DEPARTMENT                                 34 \nBrenna sits surrounded by books of old English law, colorful family banner plates, and a medieval caltrap sitting on her desk corner. \nBoring quickly, she shuts the book and sighs.  From another folder she pulls out a computer sheet. \nINSERT COMPUTER SHEET \nThe police sheet has Taupin's name and motor vehicle record. Below are listed four WILLIAM TAUPINS, their hometowns and driving records.  Richard Taupin's first driver permit was in \nBrenna looks down the list to a WILLIAM TAUPIN of Felton, Delaware, who stopped filling for driver permits in 1967, the year Richard started. \n35  EXT. GAS STATION - DAY                                          35 \nDropping a couple of quarters into a vending machine, Brenna removes and opens up a map of the State of Delaware. \n36  EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY                                            36 \nBrenna steps out of her car at a small town cemetary. \nHolding a slip of paper, she weaves her way through the shade covered tombs of revolutionary heroes and their descendants. \nOn a small rise fresh dirt lies in careless piles around an open grave. \nRichard Taupin stands at the mouth of the pit. \nA coffin has been brutally pulled from the dirt and lies open and propped diagonally beside a marker that reads: \"WILLIAM MICHAEL TAUPIN\". \nThe casket is empty. \nBRENNA Someone beat you. \nTAUPIN Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright? \nBRENNA Grave robbers? \nTAUPIN Probably. \nBRENNA Who? \nTAUPIN People like that rarely leave business cards. \nHe raises his blade. \nAn elderly WATCHMAN, shotgun cradled in his arms, stands in the clearing. \nWATCHMAN Hey!  What's going on here? \nThe Knight pauses a split second then with decision launches his sword spear-style firmly into the watchman's chest. \nTaupin pushes past him to Brenna. \nTAUPIN Run! \nBrenna is frozen in shock. Taupin shoves her roughly toward the gate. \nTAUPIN Run! \nKNIGHT MACLEOD! \nThe Knight retrieves his sword from the watchman's body and lumbers after them. \nTaupin and Brenna bolt from the cemetary and into the surround- ing residential area. \n37  EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY                                   37 \nTaupin leads an exhausted Brenna in a gallop down the side- walk. \nThey have apparently lost the Knight.  Taupin pauses at a corner.  He sees a church across the street. \n38  INT. CHURCH                                                     38 \nBrenna enters and collapses into a pew, her labored breathing echoing off the high ceiling. \nTaupin walks the length of an aisle to see that they are alone. Satisfied, he leans against a banister and considers his sit- uation. \nTrying to recover her wind, Brenna has her eyes closed and head against the back of the pew. \nBRENNA Jesus Christ. \nTAUPIN You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church. \nBRENNA Why not? \nTAUPIN (distracted) Tradition. \nBRENNA What the hell is going on? \nTaupin stares out the window, stained glass shining orange on his face.  He looks at Brenna briefly, then passes through the Church's doorway without a word. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n39  INT. MEDIEVAL BLACKSMITH SHOP                                   39 \nA glowing horseshoe HISSES wildly as it slips into a wooden cooling bucket.  Pulling it out with iron tongs, Conor lays it on a counter and pounds it even with a mallet. \nSweaty and streaked with dirt, he tosses the mallet aside and walks out into the late afternoon sunshine. \n40  EXT. SHOP FRONTAGE - DAY                                        40 \nConor leans over a water barrel and dunks his head and arms, cleaning off a day's worth of sweat and grime. \nJUAN ROMIREZ \nStirring up dust with his travelling boots, this Spanish acc- ented man stops at Conor's shop.  He wears a large broad sword strapped to his waist. \nCONOR Afternoon. \nROMIREZ Your name is Conor? \nCONOR Aye. \nROMIREZ (bows slightly) Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist. \nCONOR (notices accent) You're not from these parts. \nROMIREZ I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time. \n41  INT. CONOR'S HOME                                               41 \nRomirez is seated at a table.  His back to the Spaniard, Conor is preparing some food. \nCONOR I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here. \nROMIREZ Please go to no trouble. \nRomirez is looking at the faint, pale hint of a scar that runs from Conor's shoulder blade to his waist. \nROMIREZ Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle? \nRomirez chooses his words very carefully. \nROMIREZ Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed. \nCONOR What? \nROMIREZ We are immortal. \nStunned, Conor backs away from Romirez. \nCONOR No, that can't be. \nRomirez grasps Conor's shoulder. \nROMIREZ It is as you are. \nCONOR (pushes away) No! \nThis is all too much for Conor. \nROMIREZ Listen to me.  Hear the words. \nCONOR This is madness! \nROMIREZ It is the truth. \nCONOR No! \nRomirez suddenly draws his sword and thrusts it into Conor's heart.  The boy's mouth drops open in shocked terror as his eyes roll up into his head. \nA shudder, then Conor slides off the blade and crashes to the ground. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n43  EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY                                       43 \nBrenna stops her car in front of the Washington Police Depart- ment.  Getting out of her car she climbs the stairs but stops. \nAfter a moment of indecision she changes her mind and returns to her car. \n44  INT. BRENNA'S APARTMENT - DAY                                   44 \nBrenna lowers herself wearily into a chair, rubs her eyes, and stares absently out the window. \nReaching across to an end table, she plays back her answering machine. \nBeep. \nMALE VOICE This is Dr. Wickland at GWU.  Your test came back today.  You can call me here at the med center if you have any questions. \nClick. Beep. \nSUPERVISOR'S VOICE Brenna, where the hell are you? The place is full of cops asking weird questions.  What's going on? I've got work stacking up.  Get in here right away. \nBrenna stands and goes to the kitchen, returning with a glass of wine. \nClick. Beep. \nKNIGHT'S VOICE Brenna. \nShe freezes in her tracks. \nKNIGHT'S VOICE My quarrel is not with you.  Meet me. \nBrenna's eyes are glued on the machine. \nKNIGHT'S VOICE We have much to talk of, you and I.  Answers for the young historian. (beat) O'Reily's.  Tonight.  I've grown to like taverns. \nClick. Beep. \nSEVERAL LITTLE GIRLS (singing) Happy birthday to you, happy birth- day to you, happy birthday dear Brenna, happy birthday to you. \nBrenna is still upset from the last call. \nMOTHER'S VOICE Hi Brenna, it's mom.  Me and your neices just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.  Crissy made a real cute card for you, be sure to call her.  Will you be home for Easter?  Call when you can.  Love you. \nClick.

Bandaged about the chest, Conor asleep on his cot. \nSuddenly he sits up.  Sweating.  He looks about the room in confusion as Romirez enters with a plate of food. \nROMIREZ Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate. \nCONOR (dazed) This can't be. \nBrenna moves close to the group as they walk to the corner. The Knight follows at a measured distance. \nAt the corner the teenagers climb into a pickup and drive off. Brenna bolts into the intersection.  Weaving through SCREECHING brakes, she disappears into a pair of lighted glass doors. \n56  INT. BUILDING                                                   56 \n40 well dressed PATRONS, numbered cards pinned to their lapels, sit in velvetly plush surroundings.  At the front of the room stands a thin moustached art AUCTIONEER. \nBrenna BUSTLES in from outside. \nAUCTIONEER I apoligize for the lateness of the hour, but I'm sure you will all agree the quality of this year's collection is well worth the time. \nThe Knight BURSTS in with his leather carrying bag.  Brenna slides along the draped back wall to avoid him. \nAUCTIONEER (holding statuette) For this fine example of medieval religious art, let us open the bid at 4,000 dollars. \nThe Knight closes in on Brenna casually, without hurry. \nAUCTIONEER 10,500 once, 10,500 twice... \nBrenna raises her arm to attract the attention of a SECURITY GUARD.. \nAUCTIONEER (points at Brenna) 11,000.  A bid at 11,000. \nBRENNA No, I- \nThe guard notices she has no lapel number and starts for her very officially. \nBeing closed in on from both sides, Brenna suddenly runs across the room to a fire exit, setting off an ALARM as she flies open the door. \nThe Knight leaps after her, knocking over an OLD WOMAN in the front row. \n57  EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT                                           57 \nBrenna runs the sidewalk and disappears into a Metro station. \n58  INT. METRO STATION                                              58 \nBrenna runs down the platform and jumps into a subway car just as the doors shut. \nTHE KNIGHT \nis also now on the platform but can only watch Brenna through a window as the train pulls away. \n59  EXT. TAUPIN'S TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                   59 \nBrenna KNOCKS at the front door.  No answer. \nShe KNOCKS harder.  The unlatched door pushes open. \n60  INT. TOWNHOUSE                                                  60 \nBrenna stands in the doorway. \nBefore her is a disaster.  Furniture has been smashed like matchsticks.  A desk drawer's contents lie strewn in piles on the floor. \nBrenna enters slowly. \nBRENNA Mr. Taupin?  I have to talk to you. \nNothing has been left unturned or unbroken. \nBrenna kneels and sifts through a pile of crumpled papers. She comes across an old black and white photograph.  Badly streaked and faded, it shows Taupin standing beside a farm- house.  Written in the corner is \"Worstick, 1928\". \nBrenna slips the photo into her pocket.  Standing, she turns smack into Taupin. \nTAUPIN Finished? \nHe looks past her to the destruction of his living room.  It doesn't seem to surprise him. \nBRENNA He tried to kill me last night. \nTAUPIN Where? \nBRENNA Dupont Circle. \nTaupin sifts through the debris, selecting articles from it. \nBRENNA Who is he? \nTAUPIN At the moment?  Carl Smith. \nBRENNA And you? \nHe ignores the question. \nBRENNA What will you do now? \nRomirez puts his arm around Conor and refills his cup. \nROMIREZ You have a gift.  One you must protect. \nCONOR And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt? \nROMIREZ The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another. \nCONOR (shakes head) If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed. \nRomirez put his arm around Conor and leads him away. \nROMIREZ Come.  Enough sword play for an afternoon. \n62  EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                          62 \nA friendly horse race.  Their reflections bouncing off a clear glen, Conor and Romirez dodge moss-laiden ruts and leap fallen tree trunks. \nBeaming, Conor pushes through a last turn and stops to wait for Romirez, several lengths behind. \nCONOR (as Romirez rides up) You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders. \nROMIREZ Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod. \nBoth their eyes turn to the beauty in view.  Romirez pulls a leaf from a tree and studies it closely. \nCONOR What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf. \nROMIREZ All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that. \nHe pulls the leaf's points from the stalk, one by one. \nROMIREZ As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing. \nCONOR I do not think I like the sound of that. \nROMIREZ It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be. \nCONOR I feel hardly nothing. \nROMIREZ You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned. \nCONOR But why be so concerned about me? \nROMIREZ This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more. \nCONOR And you? \nROMIREZ I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something. \nCONOR I am not ready for this. \nROMIREZ You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them. \nCONOR Of course. \nROMIREZ You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love. \nCONOR That is not me. \nROMIREZ With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one. \nVILLAGER Conor! \nA VILLAGER approaches from across the pasture. \nCONOR Yes, Darin. \nVILLAGER Hate to be bothering you like this, but me mare threw a shoe. \nConor looks to Romirez. \nROMIREZ Go ahead, Senor. (gestures to wine) I have my friend to keep me company. \nCONOR I'll be back when I can. \nConor sets off across the pasture. \n64  INT. CONOR'S HOME                                               64 \nRomirez enters and flops onto a cot. Settling down for a nap, he sets his sword beneath the bed and closes his eyes to the distant sound of CHILDREN playing. \nThe room is still. Romirez begins to drowse. \nSuddenly his eyes leap open with full alertness. His hand moves under the cot. \nWith an EXPLOSION the front door is lifted from its hinges and splintered into fragments.  Passing through a cloud of sawdust enters the Knight.  Without pause he topples a kitchen shelf onto a supine Romirez. \nHolding Brenna's photograph, the research librarian is comb- ing through stained binders.  The room is old, disorganized, and gives the impression that every fact worth knowing must be in it somewhere. \nRESEARCHER Wilson know about this? \nBRENNA I'm doing it on my own. \nLIBRARIAN Good way to lose your job. \nBRENNA Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do. \nLIBRARIAN I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did. \nBRENNA It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it. \nLIBRARIAN You always were hard to impress. \nThe librarian pulls a binder and opens it. \nBRENNA Who is it? \nLIBRARIAN Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania. \n70  INT. MUSEUM RESEARCH OFFICE                                     70 \nBrenna enters and sits at her desk.  She is looking for something. \nBRENNA (confused) Chris, have you seen my notebook? \nChris is seated at the desk next to her.  He points at the supervisor's door. \nBRENNA Why, that son of a bitch. \n71  INT. MUSEUM SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE                                 71 \nThe high backed office chair is spun away from an angry, entering Brenna. \nBRENNA What's wrong Wilson, huh?  Not enough excitement in your own desk?  What the hell were you looking for in mine? \nThe chair turns.  Detective Moran, not her supervisor, leafs through her notebook. \nMORAN A murder. \nBRENNA You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it. \nMORAN I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right. \nBRENNA What do you want from me? \nMORAN Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town. (looks at notebook) And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons. \nBrenna lifts the telephone receiver. \nBRENNA I'm calling an attorney. \nMORAN You and I should talk first. \nBRENNA We've got nothing to say. \nMoran presses the post on the phone. \nMORAN What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people? \nBRENNA Four? \nMORAN All fashionably without heads. \nBRENNA Spare me the details. \nMORAN But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin. \nBRENNA What are you getting at, Moran? \nMORAN You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill. (looks at notebook) Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew. (looks up) In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder. \nBRENNA It'll never stick. \nMORAN But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that. \nBRENNA You're an asshole, Moran. \nMORAN I want Taupin. \nBRENNA What makes you so sure he's the one? \nMORAN Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year. \nBRENNA What's all of this got to do with me? \n81  INT. SEDAN                                                      81 \nA mile out of town Brenna stops at a farmhouse.  She checks it against the photo she found at Taupin's townhouse.  They match. \n82  EXT. FARMHOUSE DOOR - DAY                                       82 \nBrenna KNOCKS. \nTAUPIN You shouldn't have come. \nBrenna whirls around and sees Taupin behind her. \nTAUPIN We're you followed? \nHe looks to the road. \nBRENNA No. \nTAUPIN No one knows you're here? \nBRENNA No.  I had to talk to you. \nTAUPIN You had to do _nothing_! \nBRENNA You're wrong. \nTAUPIN You're a fool. \nBRENNA Maybe. \nPause.  Taupin strides through the doorway. \nTAUPIN Come inside. \n83  INT. FARMHOUSE                                                  83 \nBrenna and Taupin enter.  A heavy broad sword sits on the coffee table. \nBRENNA Is this what you killed them with? \nTAUPIN You've been listening to rumors. \nBRENNA Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder. \nTAUPIN You are.  Now. \nBeat.  They're stuck with each other. \nTAUPIN There's several bedrooms down the hall.  Take your pick. \n84  INT. BEDROOM                                                    84 \nThe room is a strange decor.  18th century paintings hang beside grotesque medieval carvings. \nBrenna's face softens with worry.  What is she doing? \n85  EXT. RURAL PAY PHONE - DAY                                      85 \nA plain-clothed POLICE OFFICER is in mid conversation. \nOFFICER No, that's the last place we saw her.  Okay, will do. \nHe hangs up. \nPARTNER Well? \nOFFICER (shrugs) We keep looking. \nPARTNER Wonderful. \n86  INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                            86 \nTaupin sits at his desk.  Before him is spread out blank birth certificates, driver licenses and title deeds.  His eyes lift to the corridor where Brenna is.  An idea has come to him. \nBrenna enters. \nBRENNA What's all that? \nTAUPIN Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared. \nBrenna walks to the window. \nBRENNA You did kill those men. \nTAUPIN Not all of them. \nBRENNA When you finish, what then? \nThe soldier hedges. \nSTAFF SARGEANT You heard the Major!  Where! \nSOLDIER #3 Whorehouse sir. \nDupont's face softens in exasperation, then toughens. \nDUPONT Your rifle.  Hand it to me. \nThe soldier obeys.  Dupont inspects the firing mechanism. \nDUPONT The flint is cracked.  No spark will reach your powder.  You will die tomorrow. \nHe throws the rifle roughly back into the soldier's hands. \nDUPONT Tomorrow you go to _battle_!  And you look like children! (beat) The General has charged me with seeing that you are prepared, and prepared you will be!  If necessary you stand here all night!  Sargeant! \nThe sargeant leaps to attention. \nSARGEANT Yes sir. \nDUPONT See to it. \nSARGEANT Yes sir. \nDupont turns briskly, then stops abruptly as if alerted by some- thing.  He whirls around and faces the young infantrymen. \nHis expression is quizzical as he walks the line, checking each face carefully. \nOne PRIVATE seizes his attention.  The private is cautious. \nDUPONT Your name? \nMULET Mulet. \nIt is as if Dupont knows him.  The two stare at each other. Dupont turns and leaves. \n90  INT. COTTAGE - EVENING                                          90 \nInside a small farmhouse commandeered for officer's quarters, Dupont (Conor) and several others eat their evening meal. \nA CAPTAIN finishes his story. \nCAPTAIN (amused) ...And what a sight!  That old mare just kept falling over her own guts till someone finally shot her. \nThe OFFICERS LAUGH.  All but Dupont. \nMAJOR (beside Dupont) Complete your inspection? \nDUPONT They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow. \nMAJOR (laughs) I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us. \nDUPONT We need more time. \nMAJOR Won't get it. (shrugs) We are a sacrifice.  A diversion. \nDupont pokes unenthusiastically at his plate. \nMAJOR Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last. \nDUPONT (rises) Not likely. \nDupont goes to the window.  Dusk shines orange on his face. \nIn the foreground the man Dupont encountered at the line-up, Mulet, is chopping firewood. \n91  EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                            91 \nSeveral hours later. Most are asleep.  Mulet continues his wood splitting. \nFrom out of the dark cottage steps Dupont. \nDUPONT (CONOR) I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill. \nMULET Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking. \nDUPONT What is your position? \nMULET Second musketeer. \nDUPONT I understand you joined up in Bremen. \nMULET You seem to understand a great deal. \nDUPONT I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me. \nDupont has backed up a few paces. \nKNIGHT All this time and still a scared little boy. \nDupont sits down. \nDUPONT Not so scared. \nKNIGHT Perhaps not. (smiles) You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck. \nDUPONT No doubt. \nKNIGHT You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion. \nDUPONT You're wrong. \nKNIGHT I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players. \nThe Knight almost seems proud of Dupont. \nDUPONT Romirez understood.  Not you. \nKNIGHT Romirez is dust. \nThe Knight looks to the altar. \nKNIGHT Finish your prayers? \nDUPONT Finish yours? \nKNIGHT (smiles) Our common heritage. (beat) I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you. (rises) I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you. \nDUPONT So sure? \nThe Knight leans forward and puts his face very near. \nKNIGHT You can't stay in church forever. \nThe Knight moves into the aisle. \nKNIGHT Good night, Major. \nHe exits. \nConor sits in the dim church alone.  Very alone. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n94  EXT. WORSTICK CHURCH (PRESENT DAY)                              94 \nRichard Taupin sits against the stone of an old Catholic church. Taupin sighs.  A long, weary sigh. \n95  INT. TAUPIN'S FARMHOUSE                                         95 \nTaupin and Brenna sit at a table working on forms. \nTaupin looks up from his work and studies Brenna's face without malice. \n95  EXT. CREEK - DAY                                                95 \nBrenna and Taupin are taking a walk along the township's outskirts. \nCrossing a small bridge over a smaller creek, they encounter the elderly caretaker Mr. North and his eight year old GRANDSON. Both with fishing poles. \nMR. NORTH Morning Mr. North \nTAUPIN Same. \nMR. NORTH Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now. \nTAUPIN No. \nMR. NORTH Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing. \nTAUPIN I'm sure that's true. \nThe grandson is having difficulty baiting his line.  Taupin bends down beside the young fisherman. \nTAUPIN (takes worm) Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest. \nGRANDSON Thanks. \nTaupin's show of affection surprises Brenna. \nTAUPIN Show you a trick. \nTaupin takes a clump of leaves from the bridge and winds them around the hook. \nTAUPIN Yes. \nThey do a final turn and finish.  The other DANCERS applaud. \nBRENNA You're using your son's name. \nTAUPIN No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son. \nBrenna is staring at him. \nTAUPIN More punch? \nHe leads her to a table. \nBRENNA Then you must be at least 70 years old. \nTAUPIN At least. \nBRENNA That's impossible. \nSeveral of the ELDERLY WOMEN are watching Taupin from across the room. \n103  EXT. BUS STATION - NIGHT                                      103 \nA bus with \"Gettysburg\" across the front pulls to a stop at a dark terminal.  A lone passenger steps off into the mist. It is the Knight, bound up in a leather jacket and carrying only a long, narrow case. \n104  EXT. - NIGHT                                                  104 \nBrenna and Taupin walk alone in the night outside the hall. \nBRENNA It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives. \nTAUPIN A factor of age. \nBRENNA I hope I never get that old. \nTAUPIN You won't. \nBrenna pulls away. \nBRENNA I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same. \nTAUPIN Why are you here? \nBRENNA I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not. (looks at him squarely) It's you. \nTAUPIN I see. \nBRENNA I'm not even sure why. \nTAUPIN Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer. \nBRENNA My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity. \nTAUPIN You are a very perceptive young woman. \nBRENNA Just a little crazy. \nA thoughtful pause. \nTAUPIN Miss Cartwright, it's time I showed you something. \n105  INT. FARMHOUSE CELLAR                                         105 \nTaupin and Brenna descend the stairs to a seemingly flush wall. \nTaupin reaches behind a bookcase and pulls something.  A press from his hand and the wall becomes a doorway. \nTAUPIN (gestures to interior) Miss Cartwright? \nBrenna steps uneasily into the darkness.  Taupin follows and switches on the light. \n106  INT. HIDDEN ROOM                                              106 \nBrenna's expression changes to awe. \nThe room is massive, a cross between a museum and an old attic. Suits of armor, Italian statuettes, Czech ironworks, Persian fetishes and a thousand other oddities from a hundred eras crowd the shelving and floor space. \nThe room has the look of ownership, as if civilization had taken the time to keep a scrapbook. \nBRENNA My God. \nThe sight is overwhelming. \nTAUPIN I had this room built some time ago. \nBrenna picks up a Carolingian tapestry and runs her hand along its intricate weaving. \nWatches the funeral quietly at a distance. \nTHE OLD WOMAN \nAs the minister continues allows her gaze to wander.  She sees Conor standing at the treeline.  Her eyes crinkle in disbelief. \nReleasing herself from her sons, she hobbles toward Conor. Confused, the brothers watch their mother leave the ceremony. \nCONOR \nWatches the woman approach but decides against moving. She stops a few paces away and looks over him. \nOLD WOMAN You. \nCONOR Katherine. \nOLD WOMAN What are you doing here? \nCONOR I owe him this. \nOLD WOMAN He never knew you. \nThe two sons come up behind.  The three stand there: an old woman who could be 60 years Conor's senior and her two sons old enough to be his father. \nSON #1 Is something wrong, Mother? \nOLD WOMAN Howard.  James.  This is your father... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n108  INT. BEDROOM                                                  108 \nTaupin and Brenna lie together. \nRunning her hands along the contours of his body she sees the countless faint scars of bullet and sword wounds. \nTaupin strokes her softly. \nTAUPIN \"Brenna\".  In Celtic is means \"woman with raven hair\".  Only chieftan's daughters were allowed it. \nBrenna is lost in Taupin's scars. \nBRENNA What is it like?  Being you? \nTAUPIN Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both. \nBRENNA But you're known so much. History I'll only read about. \nTAUPIN It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away. \nBRENNA What is it you want? \nTAUPIN All of it finished. \n109  EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING                                      109 \nTaupin and Brenna stand beside her car.  She has an armload of documents. \nTAUPIN Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall. \nBRENNA Will I see you again? \nTAUPIN Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to. \nPause.  Brenna considers touching him but instead climbs briskly into the car. \nTAUPIN Good luck. \n110  EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY                      110 \nDetective Moran and his Inspector walk among parked squad cars. \nMORAN Are you sure? \nINSPECTOR Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory. \nMORAN Round up who you can and put them on standby. \nINSPECTOR Think we should call the local P.D. out there first? \nMORAN No.  I want this to be all ours. \n111  INT. COUNTY RECORDS OFFICE                                    111 \nBrenna is standing at a counter signing the last of a stack. \nCLERK O.K. Mrs. Taupin, that's all I need. \nTAUPIN Are you here? \nKNIGHT'S VOICE I want you to come to me. \nTAUPIN And if I refuse? \nKNIGHT'S VOICE Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head. \nThis affects him. \nKNIGHT'S VOICE Yes laddie, I have her. \nTAUPIN Should I care? \nKNIGHT You have three hours. \n115  EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT                                       115 \nThe unmarked cars shoot by. \n116  INT. HOME                                                     116 \nTaupin hangs up the phone. He looks to the sword on the table, reflecting the firelight. \n117  EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                        117 \nPOLICE OFFICERS, placed around Taupin's house, are COCKING shotguns and CHAMBERING pistols. \nTwo officers take positions on either side of the door.  A third, after getting the signal, kicks the door open. \n118  INT. FARMHOUSE                                                118 \nThe officers drop to firing positions in the doorway.  The room is empty. \n119  INT. FARMHOUSE BEDROOM                                        119 \nAn officer BURSTS in.  It's empty. \n120  INT. MAIN ROOM                                                120 \nThe Inspector is on the phone. \nINSPECTOR He's not here. \n121  EXT. THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                           121 \nSpotlights seperate the whitemarble from the surrounding blackness. \nTaupin's face moves into frame. \n122  EXT. MONUMENT STAIRS - NIGHT                                  122 \nSword firmly in one hand, Taupin climb's the monument's steps. \n123  INT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - NIGHT                               123 \nA twenty-five foot bronze of Thomas Jefferson flanked by his quotations. \nA sword in one hand and Brenna in the other, the Knight stands at the statue's base. \nKNIGHT Welcome. \nTaupin stands at the entrance. \nKNIGHT Kahn sends his best. \nIn a corner the Asian's head lies on its side, the horror of death still pressed into the face.  Taupin's eyes return slowly to the Knight and Brenna. \nTAUPIN Let her go. \nThe Knight throws Brenna roughly against a wall. \nKNIGHT You disappoint me. (looks at Brenna) I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing. \nTAUPIN Leave her out of this. \nKNIGHT As you wish. \nThe Knight holds his sword out at a ceremonial angle.  Taupin does the same.  The weapons are CLANKED together twice, then pulled back into battle position. \nThe two begin walking a circle, poised swords waiting for an opening. \nThe Knight leaps first, his clash of steel RINGING off the high walls. \nAnother ATTACK without result. \nKNIGHT You can do better than that. \nMoran drives up.  There is an empty police car, the door still ajar. \n132 INT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          132 \nTaupin is badly outclassed. \nHe feebly fends off an attack, but the Knight returns quickly with a savage SLICE that rips open Taupin's stomach and throws him again to the floor. \nBRENNA You bastard! \nKNIGHT Be silent. \nBRENNA Leave him alone. \nKNIGHT You will be silent!! \nThe voice is THUNDERING. \nTaupin kneels with his forehead pressed against the floor.  His teeth grind in pain. \nThe Knight smiles. \nKNIGHT I do hope you're enjoying this as much as me. \nMORAN \nStands in the entryway.  The Knight sees him. \nKNIGHT Get out. \nMoran draws his pistol. The Knight walks toward him, \nKNIGHT This is nothing that concerns you. \nMoran levels his gun. The Knight raises his sword. \nKNIGHT You will leave! \nTwo EXPLOSIONS as Moran FIRES.  The slugs slam into the Knight, blowing him off his feet. \nHe lies still. \nMoran looks to Brenna.  To Taupin.  Then he walks closer to the Knight. \nTAUPIN (hoarse) Don't. \nTaupin curls in a spasm of pain. Moran moves closer. \nThe Knight lies face down, blood oozing from exit wounds over his heart.  He isn't breathing. \nMoran bends over slowly to see the Knight's face. \nTAUPIN Stop.  You don't understand. \nThe Knight suddenly rolls over and plants his sword into Moran's chest.  The pistol DISCHARGES against a far wall. \nTaupin crawls for the Knight. \nMoran's mouth opens but no sound escapes.  The Knight, blood pouring from his mouth and nose, thrusts deeper then retracts quickly. \nMoran slides off the sword dead. \nTaupin CUTS hard against the Knight's chest.  The Knight GAGS in surprise and crumples.  Taupin CUTS again, then puts the blade against the Knight's GURGLING throat. \nTAUPIN In mamus tuas Domine commendo spiritum meum.  Auditorium nostrum in nomine Domine. \nHe raises the sword. \nTAUPIN Requiescant in pace. \nAnd CUTS the Knight's head off. \nTaupin drops his sword. His breathing quickens. A sensation sweeps over him. \nTaupin drops to the floor WHIMPERING.  He sucks in painful gulps of air. \nBRENNA My God. \nTaupin bolts up and looks at her without seeing. \nBRENNA Conor. \nTaupin is looking past her. \nA blood-stained hand suddenly GRABS Brenna's shoulder.  She SCREAMS.  The headless body of the Knight stands beside her. \nTHE KNIGHT'S HEAD \n", "test1_input": "MORAN What were _you_ looking for? \nTAUPIN That's none of your business. \nMORAN You're wrong. \nMoran reaches into a bag on the table and removes a large broad sword; old, but in mint condition. \nMORAN Do you know what this is? \nTAUPIN I presume it's a sword. \nMORAN A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you? \nTAUPIN Your murder weapon? \nMORAN It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood. \nTAUPIN A mystery. \nMORAN For the moment. \nMoran turns the sword over in his hand then sets it down. He rises and opens the door. \nMORAN All right Mr. Taupin, we'll be in touch. \nTaupin passes through the doorway without comment. \n14  EXT.

Conor's mother, scrubbing clothes in a bucket, smiles in recognition. \nMOTHER Ah Steven, it is good to see you. \nTRAVELLER I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could. \nMOTHER You're a kind man to be sure. \nTRAVELLER I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family. \nMOTHER Steven, Conor didn't die. \nTRAVELLER But I had heard his wounds were mortal. \nMOTHER They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever. \n16  EXT.

Distant. \nCONOR I'm your future husband, remember? \nMARA I have no future husband. \nCONOR I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing. \nThis is difficult for her.  Tears well in her eyes. \nMARA My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands. \nCONOR What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you. \nMARA You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived. \nCONOR But I did live. \nMARA Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel. \nCONOR So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us. \nMARA Some think not. \nCONOR Who? \nMARA There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic. \n", "test1_true": "MARA I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you. \nCONOR You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins. \nMARA Me father has taken back my hand. \nHe puts a hand to her cheek. \nCONOR Ah, Lassie... \nShe steps back. \nMARA Please not be touching me, Conor. \nCONOR I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you. \nMARA Leave me alone, Conor.  Please. \nCONOR You're not talking sense, Mara! \nAnger tumbles into exasperation. \nCONOR \nI'm sorry. \nHe steps for her.  She moves away.  Conor's face hardens with resentment. \nCONOR If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you. \nMARA (crying) Do what you must. \nResigned, Conor turns and limps away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n17  INT.

Small and personal. \nRichard Taupin enters and sheds his overcoat. \nRECEPTIONIST Mrs. Thompson agreed to settle for fifteen, Melvin's wants to make a pick-up at three o'clock, the coffee machine's broken, and there's a Miss Cartwright from the Smithsonian in your office. \nTaupin is hardly in the mood. \n18  INT.

Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do. \nBrenna has taken a carving from the shelf. \nBRENNA Byzantine? \nTAUPIN Basil the II. \nBRENNA Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but- \nTAUPIN -All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please- \nBrenna suddenly tosses the carving at him.  Taupin snatches it out of the air with lightning precision. \nBRENNA Good reflexes. \nTAUPIN Good day, Miss Cartwright. \n19  INT.

A WAITRESS hovers over him. \nTAUPIN Lager and lime. \nLATER \nTaupin's lager is drained.  Lost in thought, he drags a finger around and around the lip of the mug. \nHe hand stops.  It twitches.  Shakes. \nTaupin pulls his hand from the glass and watches it shake slightly out of control.  A warning. \nHe WHIRLS around suddenly to see LING KAHN, Asian, standing over him. \nKAHN MacLeod. \nTaupin is anxious, poised for attack. \nKahn breaks into a broad smile. \nKAHN Spare a chair? \nTAUPIN Kahn? \nKAHN Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night? \nTAUPIN Sit. \nKahn takes his place across the table. \nTAUPIN (unsure) How are you? \nKAHN Head still secure to the neck. \nTAUPIN How did you find me? \nKAHN How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime? \nTaupin looks to his own glass. \nKAHN Old habits die hard. (to waitress) Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic! (beat) Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence. \nTAUPIN What are you doing here? \nKAHN It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores. \nTaupin tenses. \nTAUPIN And have you something to settle with me? \nKAHN (smiles) Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend. \nTAUPIN It's good to see you, Kahn. \nThe waitress sets down two glasses. \nKAHN Come, toast with me the past. (raises glass) To old conquests, old loves, and to a time when we cared about either. \nKahn drains his glass. \nKAHN Waitress! \n51  EXT.

For a Pope. \nKAHN (sighs) Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.

Ever since I was a kid. \nTAUPIN You were never a kid. \nKahn leans on the wall of a water buffalo pen. \nKAHN (points at one) I knew his great-grandfather. \nTAUPIN You're insane. \nKAHN No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon. \nTAUPIN How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long? \nKAHN Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.

Another one. \nCONOR What would you like? \nKATHERINE Something pretty. \nCONOR Like you. \nConor cups his hands, bends his fingers, and comes up with a four leaf clover. \nKATHERINE That's wonderful.

While you still can. \nThe youth pushes away from the grasp. \nYOUNG MAN You don't frighten me. \nCONOR I should. \nThe young man throws a fist at Conor.  It is easily blocked.

That's not meant for you.  Just some didn't take much to your father. \nBRENNA Why? \nTAUPIN My father was never one for social whirls. \nMR. TAUPIN Kept to himself for sure.  Then with all that business in '31. \nBRENNA What business? \nMR. NORTH Family down the road from the Taupin place was murdered.  All cut up they were.  Horrible.  Two strangers were also found with the bodies.  No one ever accused William, but with his reputation as a loner and the rumors about him and some of the wives in town, folks just never forgot.  Most were relieved when they heard he'd died.  Sorry Mr. Taupin. \nTAUPIN Nothing to be sorry about. \nMR. NORTH Just your pappy scared some. \nThe rock band finished as a PORTLY MAN in a union soldier's uniform takes the microphone. \nPORTLY All right, the kids have had their fun.

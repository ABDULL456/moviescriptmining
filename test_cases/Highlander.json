You wouldn't know anything about it would you? \nTAUPIN Your murder weapon? \nMORAN It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood. \nTAUPIN A mystery. \nMORAN For the moment. \nMoran turns the sword over in his hand then sets it down.

Conor's mother, scrubbing clothes in a bucket, smiles in recognition. \nMOTHER Ah Steven, it is good to see you. \nTRAVELLER I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could. \nMOTHER You're a kind man to be sure. \nTRAVELLER I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family. \nMOTHER Steven, Conor didn't die. \nTRAVELLER But I had heard his wounds were mortal. \nMOTHER They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever. \n16  EXT.

Distant. \nCONOR I'm your future husband, remember? \nMARA I have no future husband. \nCONOR I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing. \nThis is difficult for her.  Tears well in her eyes. \nMARA My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands. \nCONOR What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you. \nMARA You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived. \nCONOR But I did live. \nMARA Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel. \nCONOR So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.

From those others below, maybe.  But not from you. \nMARA Leave me alone, Conor.  Please. \nCONOR You're not talking sense, Mara! \nAnger tumbles into exasperation. \nCONOR \nI'm sorry. \nHe steps for her.  She moves away.

Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do. \nBrenna has taken a carving from the shelf. \nBRENNA Byzantine? \nTAUPIN Basil the II. \nBRENNA Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but- \nTAUPIN -All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please- \nBrenna suddenly tosses the carving at him.

Brenna slides along the draped back wall to avoid him. \nAUCTIONEER (holding statuette) For this fine example of medieval religious art, let us open the bid at 4,000 dollars. \nThe Knight closes in on Brenna casually, without hurry. \nAUCTIONEER 10,500 once, 10,500 twice... \nBrenna raises her arm to attract the attention of a SECURITY GUARD.. \nAUCTIONEER (points at Brenna) 11,000.

I have to talk to you. \nNothing has been left unturned or unbroken. \nBrenna kneels and sifts through a pile of crumpled papers. She comes across an old black and white photograph.  Badly streaked and faded, it shows Taupin standing beside a farm- house.  Written in the corner is \"Worstick, 1928\". \nBrenna slips the photo into her pocket.  Standing, she turns smack into Taupin. \nTAUPIN Finished? \nHe looks past her to the destruction of his living room.

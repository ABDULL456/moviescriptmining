Sam and the detectives turn as a professorial-looking guy in a baggy brown suit (ART MADDOX) arrives on the scene. 
SAM Art.  Say hello to Detectives Perez and Duquette. (to the cops) Art Maddox. A fellow guidance counselor. 
Art and the detectives shake hands. 
ART So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life? 
SAM I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie. 
Gloria seems to find this amusing.  Ray stands at her side, looks at Sam.  Sam feels it, makes eye contact with Ray -- a beat -- at which point, Ray puts a hand on Gloria's back. 
RAY I've got that two o'clock in town. 
GLORIA (nodding) Back to the land of grownups. 
The detectives shake hands once more with San and Art. 
SAM (to Gloria) If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour. 
GLORIA (smiling) I'd like that. 
Ray opens a door for her.  The detectives pass through it. 
Art claps Sam on the shoulder, then walks off down the hallway. Sam remains near the doors, watching as... 
ANGLE ON THE DRIVE LEADING TO THE SCHOOL 
Ray and Gloria walk past half a dozen expensive cars -- Range Rovers, Beamers and Mercedes, to a plain, white Ford Taurus, which they get into and drive away. 
EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - LATER 
Cheerleaders perform a sensual dance on the porch of a wooden pagoda.  A rugby team runs drills on the grass, as out on the bay, six tiny racing sloops tack toward the docks. 
ANGLE ON DOCKS 
As the sloops enter the narrow channel between the slips one student from each boat jumps onto the dock where he or she sets about tying off the boat. 
Sam is on one of the boats.  Jimmy Leach is at the rudder. 
SAM (loud enough to be heard by his class) Okay, you guys.  Good work.  Now coil those dock lines and I'll see you all on Monday. 
He watches his class clamber up the docks.  His eye falls upon the pagoda, the dancing cheerleaders -- Kelly Van Ryan in work-out tights -- bare arms reaching for the sky. 
EXT. SCHOOL DOCKS - SAM & JIMMY - LATER 
hosing down boats, stowing sails.  They look up as... A HUGE POWER BOAT glides past.  The docks rock in its wake. 
JIMMY All right.  I could party on that. 
Sam just laughs at him. 
SAM That's about all it's good for. (beat) That's the one to have. 
He points to a beautiful triple-masted schooner headed out of the bay, under sail. 
SAM The Windward Passage.  I crewed on that one summer. (beat) Long time ago. 
He pulls his eyes from the boat, sets about coiling a line. 
JIMMY You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees... 
SAM Hey, you're working for it. (beneath a laugh) Least you're supposed to be. 
He tosses Jimmy the coiled line.  Jimmy's caught off-guard, but catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with Sam. 
VOICE (O.S.) Can I play too?  Or is it just for boys? 
Sam and Jimmy turn to find Kelly Van Ryan at the far end of the dock.  She's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse knotted at the bottom to REVEAL a flat, tanned stomach; open at the top to REVEAL the swelling of her breasts.  She favors Sam with a coy smile. 
KELLY So who's washing your car this weekend, Mr. Lombardo? (off Sam's blank look) The senior car wash, remember? (beat) Tamara's making a schedule.  She said you bought a coupon but you're not on anybody's list. 
Sam smiles, remembering. 
SAM Well, you know.  Figured I'd buy a Washing ticket, support the effort. That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste of time, don't you think? 
Sam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the dock, Jimmy at his side.  Kelly falls in with then. 
KELLY Not at all.  How about if Nicole and I do it?  We're working as a team. 
Sam just looks at her.  She looks back -- big, pleading eyes. 
SAM Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off. 
KELLY Deal. (beat) You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one? 
Sam doesn't answer right away.  He looks toward the school. 
KELLY (CONT'D) You wouldn't want me to walk, would you? I mean like, something bad might happen. 
Sam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to Jimmy, who seems to regard Kelly with something akin to physical pain.

CROM Sure, if I don't have a User, then who wrote me? 
RAM That's what you're doing here. Master Control Program's been snapping up all us programs who believe...if he thinks you're useful, he takes over all your functions so he gets bigger... an' if he can't use you, he sends you down here to the Game Grid to get the bits blasted outta you. What's your name? 
CROM Crom. 
RAM 
I'm Ram. They'll train you for the games, but ... well, I hope you make it okay. Hey, what's going on in the other sectors? I've been stuck in this Grid for 200 microcycles. 
He points to several hash marks on his cell wall. 
CROM It's murder out there. You can't even travel around your own microcircuits without permission from that Master Control creep. Hauling me down here to play games...who does he calculate he is? 
(holds his head in his hands) If only Tron was still around... 
He looks up as Ram makes a NOISE under his breath. Ram has a strange, still expression on his face. 
CROM You ever see that guy in action? Hundred-percent independent. MCP couldn't tell him what to -- 
He stops. Ram is looking over his shoulder. 
CROM (continuing) What's wrong? What did I say? 
There's a slight noise from cell beyond Ram's.

24   THE FIGURE AT THE WINDOW                                     24 
It turns slowly, silhouetted by the light from the outer corridor. 
25   CLOSE UP - CROM                                              25 
reacting.  He GASPS and stares. 
CROM Oh my User...Tron--they've got you in here? 
26   SHOT FROM OVER TRON'S SHOULDER                               26 
with Ram to one side, smiling slightly, and Crom staring. 
TRON Not for long, friend.

27   ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. PATHWAYS - SOMEWHERE FAR             27 OFF IN THE SYSTEM 
Here in a maze of complex pathways, we see a lone tank moving along one of the paths. 
28   INT. TANK                                                    28 
A lone program sits at the controls. His armor is worn and beaten and his glow subdued. This is CLU. With his thermos of glowing coffee and his suicide-jockey manner, he reminds us of a truck driver on an all-night run. 
CLU Think we can merge into this mem'ry okay, good buddy? 
A spot of glowing light zips around the tank, stops and expands into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as it speaks. 
BIT (eagerly) 
As soon as it is finished speaking, it goes back to being pure light. 
CLU Now, ol' Flynn said to look over in here ... 
28A  EXT. TANK                                                    28A 
The tank makes a quick run through a maze-like path with rounded corners -- a computer memory microcircuit. 
28B  INT. TANK                                                    28B 
CLU ...but I don't see what he's looking for. I'd better get over to that input/output tower and let him know. 
28C  ANGLE OVER HIS SHOULDER                                      28C 
at the instrument panel. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
29   REAL WORLD - INT. A DARKENED ROOM - NIGHT                    29 
A shot OVER THE SHOULDER of a figure typing on a computer terminal keyboard, talking to himself in a low voice. He stop typing, waits for some information to read out. Beyond him we see a couple of large video parlor game consoles. 
FLYNN Come on, you scuzzy little data, be in there... 
30   A SHOT FROM IN FRONT OF HIM                                  30 
He's a young, blonde guy in his mid-twenties. Very attractive, charming, innocent looking, but with a devilish gleam in his eye. 
FLYNN I've got such nice blue paper to print you out on, if you'll just sit still... 
WE ZOOM IN on that gleam in his eye and see the brilliant colors of the CRT screen reflected there.

MARAIS HOUSE                                      39 An ample house. PAN ACROSS a gallery of oil paintings depicting great moments in Boer history -- the Great Trek, an endless progression of oxcarts heading north, the Battle of Blood River against the Zulu armies, the hang- ing of Boer farmers by British regulars. Women and children herded into a detention camp as their farms burn in the background. Boer kommandos sniping at a British column on the veldt. \nPAN FROM the pictures TO photographs, sepia-toned, his- torical, and DR. DANIEL MARAIS and PK, strolling past the pictures. Marais points to a photo of a young Boer, turn of the century, posed stiffly with a rifle in the slouched hat of a Boer kommando. MARAIS Jan Piet Marais. My uncle. At 22 he led a kommando for three years before your people caught him and hung him. \nPK My people? \nMARAIS The English. \nPK I consider myself an African, sir. \nMARAIS As do I. As do the Zulu, the Xhosa, the Pongo, the Ndebele. We're all Africans. But all from separate tribes, ay? \nPK Unfortunately. \nMARAIS Why do you say that? PK Because it's the whole tribal idea that creates our problems here in South Africa. MARAIS The problems of South Africa, my boy, do not come from tribalism. They come from counter-tribalism. From people insisting that natural laws which have been in place and operating since God's creation, should be tampered with. Does the gazelle sleep with the lion? Does the rhino graze with the mouse? The separation of things is not coincidental. Do you think a Zulu wants to see his culture, his sense of identity, replaced by someone else's anymore than I do? \nPK No, sir. But I don't think he wants being a Zulu to mean he is denied the same rights as everyone else has. \nMARAIS Which is why civilization is defined by the ability to live under the rule of law. Laws define rights. \nPK But do they define justice? MARAIS Ah. Justice. The banner behind which the English marched as they gobbled up a quarter of the world? Justice, my boy, is only relative to who's in charge. \nPK And how long they stay in charge is only relative to how well they dispense that justice... (beat) ... with all due respect. \nMarais fixes PK with a stare.   PK's eyes meet his evenly, unwavering. Maria enters. \nMARIA Papa, would you like coffee in the library or the parlor? \nMARAIS (pleasant) The library, mein leib. \nMaria smiles at PK and exits.   He leads PK towards the library. \nMARAIS I can't figure out if you're brave or foolish. PK Why is that, sir? \nMARAIS You come here to ask for permission to see my daughter. Correct? \nPK Yes, sir. MARAIS And knowing  who I am, what I stand for, do you  think this sort of discussion  is going to put that request in  a favorable light? \nPK I thought a man of your intellectual reputation wouldn't want his daughter seeing someone who didn't think. \nMARAIS Let me give you some advice then. You're right. I admire a keen mind.  But intellectual reputation or not, I am first a Marais, a member of the Volk. \nMARAIS (CONT'D) And if you're trying to impress a member of the Volk with your intellect, don't do it espousing liberal ideas picked up in an English private school. \nPK These ideas I picked up somewhere else. \nMarais opens the library door. MARAIS (joking) No doubt from an expert on race relations. PK Actually, sir, from an expert on cactus. \nCUT TO: \n40   EXT. ROCK OUTCROPPING - DAY                                40 \nA brilliant African sun beats down on the veldt below. On the rock, a seven-year-old PK sits looking somewhat sadly over the landscape. A long shadow covers him. The CLICK of a CAMERA is heard. PK turns, shielding his eyes with his hand against the glare of the sun to a tall, white-haired figure, shirtless, in hiking boots and kneesocks, holding a box camera. \nDOC (FIGURE) Ja. Perfect.    You will excuse me, please. \nDOC, speaking in German-accented English, moves off from the sun's glare down to PK's level. On his back is a knapsack with a cactus sticking out of it. \nDOC This I do not normally without permission do, ja? But to catch the expression. After all, it is the expression that is important. Ja? Without the expression the human being is just a lump of meat. You have some problems, I think. I am Professor Karl von Vollensteen. \nDoc clicks his heels together and bows his head slightly. \nPK I'm P.K. \nHe holds out his hand.   Doc takes it. \nDOC Such a young person with such an \nold expression. I think we can be friends. Ja? \nEighteen-year-old PK narrates. \nPK (V.O.) That was how I met Doc, as he insisted I call him. A chance meeting between a directionless seven-year-old boy and an old German professor out collecting cacti on the African bush veldt. (pause) So began my education. \nDoc and PK walk the veldt across craggy mountain trails, down dry river beds, through the jungle, always collecting cacti and aloe samples, Doc always talking, always explaining. \nPK (V.O.) Doc believed the brain had two functions and that the South African public school system unfortunately dealt with only one. \n", "test1_true": "Doc and PK sit high up. PK watches the endless animal migration below while Doc points things out across the landscape. \nPK (V.O.) Doc knew everything. He had a love of learning. But his real passion was centered around two things -- music and cacti. CUT TO: \n41   EXT. DOC'S HOUSE                                           41 \nPK and Doc walk up a steep road toward Doc's house which sits on top of the hill, both carrying cacti-filled \npacks. \nPK (V.O.) Until he was fifty, Doc had a successful career as a concert pianist all over Europe. On his fiftieth birthday he gave it all up and moved to South Africa. From that point on it was all cactus. CUT TO: \n42   EXT. CACTUS GARDEN - DAY                                42 \nBehind Doc's simple, whitewashed cottage is a magnif- icent cactus and aloe garden filled with the samples Doc has collected for years. PK and Doc plant another specimen. Doc photographs it. PK records its genus in a notebook. \nPK (V.O.) Every specimen Doc found would be carefully photographed and catalogued. \nCUT TO: \n43   SUNSET                                                       43 \nDoc an PK walk through the cactus garden. DOC If God would choose a plant to represent Him, I think He would choose of all plants the cactus. This one plant has all the blessings He tried but failed to give man. It is true. Look. The cactus is humble but not submissive. It grows where no other plant will grow. The sun bakes its back, the wind rips it from cliffs, or drowns it in the dry desert sand. Not a complaint. In good times or bad it will still flower. It protects itself from danger. \nDoc touches a cactus needle. \nDOC But it harms no other plant.   It \nhas patience and solitude and modesty. In Mexico there is a cactus that blooms once in a hundred years and then only at night. That is saintliness of the highest order I think. Ja? From cactus comes medicine to heal the wounds of men and little buttons if you eat one you can touch the face of God or stare into the mouth of hell. It is the plant of patience, solitude, love, and madness. Modesty, beauty. Toughness and gentleness. Of all the plants I think it is closest to God. Ja? \nPK (V.O.) Doc was a hard man to disagree with. So when he decided I must spend as much time with him to remedy the flaw in my educational environment I didn't argue. CUT TO: \n44   INT. GRANDFATHER'S PARLOR                                 44 \nShabbily-genteel, Doc sits in his Sunday best, a cup of tea on his lips, talking in earnest to PK's pipe- puffing, also shabbily-genteel grandfather as PK looks on. \nPK (V.O.) Appealing to my grandfather's stoic belief in the primacy of European culture in all its forms, Doc offered to instruct me in piano in return for my helping him locate and gather his precious cacti. \nCUT TO: \n45   INT. DOC'S COTTAGE                                        45 \nDoc and PK practice on a beautiful Steinway, so grandly out of place in Doc's simple abode. \nPK (V.O.) As a student of music I was never more than adequate, something I suspect Doc knew from the start. It is the love of music that is most important, he would tell me, and I would believe him. \nCUT TO: \n46   EXT. JUNGLE                                               46 \nDoc and PK wander through the jungle looking for flora. \nDOC Everything fits, P.K. Nothing is unexplained. Nature is one big chain reaction. Everything depends on everything else. From the smallest to the biggest. Always in life an idea starts small like a tree. \nDoc shows PK a small tree with an even smaller vine attached to it. DOC This tree can grow so high it can touch the face of the sky. But this little vine can choke it and keep it small. Most people are like these vines. Afraid of new ideas. Afraid to let things grow. \nDoc rips the vine away from the tree. DOC Always listen to yourself. Follow your own idea. If you are wrong, so what? You learn something. And with learning you grow stronger. And if you are right at the beginning? An even bigger bonus. \nCUT TO: \n47   EXT. VELDT - DAY                                          47 \nDoc and PK move alongside the great herds. \nPK (V.O.) I roamed the kloofs and ridges, the dry riverbeds and jungle floors with Doc for over a year, learning more than I realize even today. (pause) I also played a lot more 'God Save the King' due to my new musical celebrity. \nCUT TO: \n48   EXT. BARBERTON - DAY                                         48 TRACK THROUGH Barberton, a small town on the low veldt, in all its colonial backwater splendor. \nPK (V.O.) Barberton was a very proper English town with a proper square, a wide main street, and the colonials' overblown patriotism for a homeland most people had never seen, hanging in the air like fine dust. Not quite seen, but there nonetheless. CUT TO: \n49   INT. CONCERT HALL                                       49 PK plays \"God Save the King\" on the stage. The town's population stands -- the men, stoic; the women, dewey- eyed, at patriotic attention. Some people file out -- the men in officers' uniforms of the South African penal system and their wives -- Boers. They exit to the dagger stares and some undertoned hissing and booing from Her Majesty's loyal subjects. \nPK (V.O.) The only Afrikaaners to live in Barberton were sent there to work at the government prison, just outside town. Germany had covertly supported the Boers in their two unsuccessful wars against British rule, supplying food and medical supplies as well as ample stocks of ammunition. \nPK (V.O.)(CONT'D) Germany was an old friend, a trusted friend. And in a country where a handshake is a friendship and a friendship a bond for life, as the war in Europe grew fiercer tensions in Barberton heated up. Suspicion was afoot. Spies were everywhere. \nCUT TO: \n50   EXT. ROAD TO DOC'S COTTAGE - DAY                           50 \nDoc and PK walk toward the cottage.   Doc reads PK's report card. DOC Grammar: satisfactory. Science: satisfactory. Mathetmatics: satisfactory. He looks down at PK. \nDOC P.K., if there is one thing I know you to be that is a lot more than just satisfactory. Ja? \nPK But I don't want to be known as a brain. \nDOC Why not? \nPK Who do you think gets beaten up on all the time in school? DOC My boy, to be smart is not a sin. But to be smart and not use it, that is sin number one. And as for getting beat up on, use your brain to figure out how not to be. He hands PK the report card, his displeasure obvious. As they crest the hill the cottage comes INTO VIEW along with a parked Army car and two armed soldiers leaning against it. Seeing Doc and PK, the soldiers smarten up, raising their rifles and advancing. \nDoc's face grows pale, his lips tight.   PK pulls close to him for support. \n", "test1_id": 852, "test2_input": "GEEL PIET No, no.   Mustn't do that, little baas. \nPK I don't understand. \nDOC What Geel Piet means is it can be dangerous. Something the guards might not want the people to have. \nPK What's wrong with tobacco? Why wouldn't they want them to have it? \nDOC What's wrong is people whose job it is to punish. After a little while it is all they know how to do. \nPK What should I do? \nDOC This is for you to answer. \nThe sound of a TRUNCHEON on METAL turns them to the door where SERGEANT BORMANN, a side of beef with a sadist's eyes, stands, truncheon in hand. He enters the room and circles the trio. \nBORMANN I smell something not right here, ay, kaffir? He pokes Geel Piet with his truncheon. \nGEEL PIET (submissive) No, meneer sergeant. Everything okay here. \nBormann swings his truncheon into the back of Geel Piet's knees, buckling the little man to the floor. BORMANN I don't fuckin' believe you. \nHe glares at Doc and PK. BORMANN If you're up to something I'll find out. \nBormann, still eying them suspiciously, exits.     Doc and PK help Geel Piet up. \nDOC Schweinhund. \nGEEL PIET No, no.  This old kaffir's okay. Sorry to make any trouble, little baas. We  just stick to the boxing now on.  Sorry, sorry. \nGeel Piet goes hobbling off, picking up towels.     Doc and PK go to exit. At the door PK turns. \nPK Geel Piet. Geel Piet turns. \nPK I leave my bucket on the side by Doc's toilet when I practice piano. \nGeel Piet breaks out a smile he usually keeps to himself and exits. PK looks up at Doc who tossles his hair approvingly. \nDOC PK, to me you are the champion of the world already. Come. Let us go box now with Mr. Beethoven. \nPK and Doc exit. CUT TO: \n68   INT.

Solly gives him instruction as Morrie stands by. \nSOLLY Now at the end of the Geel Piet eight you do this... one-two... (he punches the air) One-two-three... the Solly Goldman thirteen. Okay? \nPK nods. Solly hits the BELL.   The sparring begins.      PK works his way in. \nSOLLY That's it. That's it. Move him around. Jab jab. Slip slip. Now. PK pours it on, laying in the Geel Piet eight.   Solly is silently counting. \nSOLLY And... one-two... one-two-three. \nPK fires the last three punches like lightning and backs up. \nSOLLY That's it. That's it. Now work around the defense. Jab jab. The opponent becomes aggressive.   PK starts dancing, slipping punches. \nMORRIE How do you get away with this, Mr. G? Why don't they close you down? I mean, there are laws about blacks and white boxing each other. \nSOLLY In a public match. Not in a gym. Not yet anyway. The Boer is a funny people. Outside the ring the black is not equal. Inside he is. But only in private, not in public. So I keep my mouth shut, the police go a little blind, and that's that. It's a crazy world, huh? \nA WHISTLE from across the gym draws Solly's attention. He and Morrie turn to his office where his assistant stands with the tall black man from the Schoolboy Championships. Solly's face takes on a serious ex- pression. He rings the bell. He turns to Morrie. \nSOLLY Work him on the heavy bag. \nSolly heads for his office. \n69   ANGLE ON PK                                                 69 \nturning away from his opponent.

What's going on? \nPK I don't know. \nMORRIE Well why don't you tell me what you do know. PK There's an African myth about an outsider who comes one day and unites all the tribes into one against their oppressors. They call it the myth of Onoshobishobi Ingelosi -- the tadpole angel. That chanting at the school championships? \nMORRIE For you? PK I haven't heard it in years. \nPK begins to disrobe. MORRIE And how did this honor fall on your broad back? \nPK I told you about bringing tobacco to the prisoners at Barberton? Well after that was going for a while I learned that even though they could send and receive letters, they never did. They couldn't read or write. MORRIE So you did it for them. \nPK Right. \nMORRIE And after that? \nPK A clothing program for their families and a food program. One thing sort of led to another. \nMORRIE I can see where 'angel' would be an appropriate title.

He looks across at Mandoma whose face is a mask looking straight ahead, betraying nothing. The two men climb into the ring and stand in their corners. The Old Woman shuffles over and peers into PK's face. She mutters something inaudible, then turns to the crowd. \nOLD WOMAN Onoshobishobi Ingelosi. \nThe crowd picks up the chant. She waves and the crowd goes silent. Somewhere in the darkness a single voice begins to sing \"Nkosi Sikelel I Afrika\" -- the African national anthem. \nThe crowd picks it up. PK looks down to the front row where Nguni sits courteously attending to Maria in a seat of honor among the twelve men in suits. \nThe African national anthem finishes. The BELL RINGS three times. The Old Woman is led from the ring. An Indian Referee in all white enters the ring and waves the two fighters forward. \nREFEREE You are listening to me please. When I am shouting break, you must break at once. When a knockdown is coming, it is for an eight count. No heads, no elbows. You fight clean or by golly I am giving you penalty points. Good luck, boys. PK and Mandoma touch gloves and go to their respective corners. \nPK What do you see? \nSolly watches Mandoma dancing across the ring. \nSOLLY A very tough fight. \nThe BELL RINGS. \nSOLLY Watch the left hook. \nMandoma comes charging across the ring and begins to fire everything in his arsenal at PK, overwhelming him. PK cannot get away from him and takes a series of devastat- ing combinations which end in a left hook to PK's jaw. PK drops like lead. The Referee starts counting. PK shakes his head clear and rises at eight. The Referee checks his gloves. There is a cut under his right eye. REFEREE Continue. Again, Mandoma comes charging hard. PK defends himself as best he can, trying to counter. But Mandoma's offense won't allow it. He beats on PK until the round ends. PK sits down in his corner. Morrie works on his eye. PK God, he hits like a truck. \nSOLLY He's going for the quick knockout. He can't keep it up. Soon the truck runs out of gas. \nPK If he catches me again like that I'll run out of gas -- permanently. \nThe BELL SOUNDS. PK is hardly off his stool when Mandoma is on him, pummeling him. PK backpedals, bobs and weaves. Mandoma's punches come fast and furious, each one looking to end the fight. Mandoma gets PK against the ropes and bangs away. PK covers up. Mandoma punishes his arms and kidneys. PK swings back and es- capes. Mandoma pursues him. He catches PK with a body chop and then a chopping left. PK goes down again. The Referee starts to count. The crowd is completely silent. The BELL RINGS. PK returns to his corner, shaking his head, trying to clear it. He flops onto his stool. \nSOLLY He's had it. He's got no strength in his punch. \nPK Could've fooled me. \nSOLLY I'm telling you. \nPK \nTell him. \nMORRIE Look -- he's taking water. \nThey all look. \n105   THEIR POV                                                  105 \nof Mandoma, breathing heavily, sweating profusely, drinks deeply from his water flask. \n106   BACK TO SCENE                                              106 \nSOLLY See. Where that water goes -- you go. Right to here. \nHe pokes PK's belly. \nSOLLY You put your punches there, you win. You don't, you lose. \nThe BELL RINGS. Mandoma comes charging out. PK goes on defense. He hits Mandoma hard to the head. Mandoma whips around and hits him hard. PK spins and hits the canvas. His vision blurs, doubles. The SOUND of a WATERFALL fills his head. \nFLASH TO: 107   PK                                                         107 \nstruggling to climb the rocks in the pool below the waterfall. He is halfway across this time. \nCUT TO: \n108   REFEREE                                                    108 \nREFEREE Three... four... five... \nFLASH TO: \n", "test3_id": 854}

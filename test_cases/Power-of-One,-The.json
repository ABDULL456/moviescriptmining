{"train": "THE POWER OF ONE \nWritten by ROBERT MARK KAMEN \nBased on the Novel by BRYCE COURTENAY \nFebruary 1990 Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY Copyright \u00a9 1990 Warner Bros. \nTHE POWER OF ONE \nWhat if the power of one becomes the power of many and the power of many becomes the power of one? \nFADE IN: \n1   EXT. SOUTH AFRICAN FARM - DAY (1939)                      1 \nA white car sits in the yard of the farmhouse. On the door, a decal: \"CAPETOWN SANITORIUM.\" Two men dressed in the white uniforms of the sanitorium exit the farm- house; one gently guiding a rather frail, troubled woman toward the car; the other totes her suitcase. \nThe V.O. of a young man narrates: \nYOUNG MAN (V.O.) There comes a time in everyone's life when they discover that the only person you can truly depend on is yourself. That the only real power anyone has to get anything done is the power of one. With any luck you can make it through a lot of years before you ever have to face the reality of that fact. (beat) It was a luxury I never had. I discovered it the year my mother had her nervous breakdown. \nOne attendant holds the rear door of the car open for the woman. Before entering, she turns one last time toward the farmhouse. \n2   HER POV                                                   2 \nA young BOY looking one part scared, one part sad, and one part lost stares back at her, his hand held by a large, amiable black woman with tears rolling down her round cheeks. \nYOUNG MAN (V.O.) I was all of six. \n3   BACK TO SCENE                                                3 \nThe woman enters the car. The car drives off down the road. The Boy watches it disappear behind a plume of swirling dust. YOUNG MAN (V.O.) My father died before I was born, and even though I was raised by my Zulu nanny, with my mother, depending on her health, in nominal attendance, it was decided, with her departure, that I, too, would depart... (beat) ... for boarding school. \nThe dust the Boy has been watching reverses itself. An unseen vehicle comes up the road. \nYOUNG MAN (V.O.) But before I could be sent out into the world one very serious matter had to be dealt with. (beat) I was a chronic bedwetter. Since my nanny was the one responsible for my well-being, she did what any responsible Zulu mother would do. She called on the greatest medicine man of her tribe -- Inkosi Inkosikazi. \nOut of the dust a large black Buick ROADMASTER ROARS up the road and into the yard, scattering chickens and geese, stopping in front of the wide-eyed six-year-old and his tremulous nanny. A huge Zulu jumps out of the front passenger seat and opens the rear door. A moment passes, and then two splayed, cracked feet descend from the car and settle into the dust. INKOSI INKOSIKAZI, 100 years old, small, black, wizened, hair and beard whiter than cotton, a leopard skin draped over his shoulders, a beaded fly switch in one hand, a trussed chicken in the other, exits the car. \nCUT TO: \n4   EXT. YARD - NIGHT                                       4 \nA fire burns bright in the black African night. The Boy sits holding the chicken, close by the fire, while Inkosi Inkosikazi shuffles around him, drawing a circle in the dust with a stick. \nYOUNG MAN (V.O.) Legend had it that Inkosi Inkosikazi was the last son of the great Zulu king, Dingaan, who fought both the Boers and the British to a standstill nearly 100 years before, and the night Inkosi Inkosikazi was conceived stars fell from the sky until the sun rose. The circle    complete, the old man sits down opposite the Boy. From     a leather pouch he produces several bones. He throws the    bones on the ground and studies them for a moment. He     begins to wave the fly switch back and forth in front of    the Boy's eyes, chanting low, softly. The Boy's eyes    grow heavy; his lids droop. \n5   DREAM - EXT. WATERFALL                                     5 \nThe Boy and the old man are standing above a great waterfall. In the swirling pool far below are ten stepping stones linking one bank to the other. \nYOUNG MAN (V.O.) The medicine man instructed me to jump off the falls and climb along the ten stepping stones, counting as I went until I reached dry land. \nThe Boy jumps, cascading down the   falls and into the pond below.  He clambers up the first   rock. It is slippery. He falls off and climbs back on,   buffeted by the spraying water.  He makes his way stone by   stone toward the other side. \nYOUNG MAN (V.O.) Even though it was only a dream, I felt as if my struggle to reach dry land was terrifyingly real. The water was like ice, bone- chilling, cold, and as I made my way from one stone to the next I could feel my strength desert me. The progress from one step to the next gets progressively harder as the Boy keeps slipping into the swirling water, coughing and sputtering. \nYOUNG MAN (V.O.) I was three rocks in when I ran out of gas. I couldn't pull myself any further. No matter how hard I \ntried, the current tried harder. I felt myself going under for the last time. \nThe Boy's grip slips off the rock.   He starts to go under. \nCUT TO: \n6   EXT. FARMYARD - DAWN                                       6 The fire has gone out. The Boy is still sitting in the circle, the chicken still in his lap. His eyes snap open. The first thing he sees is Inkosi Inkosikazi sitting across from him with a big smile. \nCUT TO: \n7   EXT. YARD - DAY                                            7 \nInkosi Inkosikazi enters the Buick. The Boy and his smiling nanny watch. They Boy still holds the chicken. \nYOUNG MAN (V.O.) Inkosi Inkosikazi said the spirit of the great Zulu warriors lived in me. He told me that whenever trouble arose I should return to the waterfall and keep stepping across the rocks until the trouble passed. He said three rocks were enough to conquer my problem with the night water; that I was very brave. He said I was a man for all Africa, bound to her by my spirit, bound by my dreams. (beat) And he let me keep the chicken. \nThe Boy and his nanny watch the car go off in a cloud of dust. CUT TO: \n8   EXT. VELDT - DAY                                           8 \nThe Boy sits on a train looking out the window at the veldt and the wildlife moving across in the distance. \nA sack on his lap moves. The chicken's head pops out. The Boy gives him some kernels of corn and scratches behind his scraggly comb. \nYOUNG MAN (V.O.) Although I was bound by spirit \nand dream to Africa, I was bound by heritage and language to the birthplace of my grandparents -- England -- a country I had never seen, but one that was to cause me eminently more problems than bedwetting ever did. \nCUT TO: \n9    EXT. ROAD TO SCHOOL                                        9 \nJAAPIE For crimes committed against the whole Boer people. I, Jaapie Botha, the judge and Uberfuhrer, sentence you and your Rooinek kaffir chicken to death. Heil Hiter.! \nALL Heil Hitler! \nJaapie starts to swing the sling around and around.     The six-year-old struggles to get free. \nALL Heil Hitler!   Heil Hitler! The SLING WHISTLES through the air, faster and faster. \nBOY No! Jaapie releases the stone. It flies true, catching the SQUAWKING, struggling CHICKEN flush in the chest. The flapping stops as blood soaks through feathers. \nJaapie flings his hand forward, victorious. \nJAAPIE Heil Hitler! \nALL Heil Hitler! \nThe Boy takes the opportunity to break loose. He rushes Jaapie, whose arm is outstretched, putting him off balance. The Boy catches him low, driving his head into Jaapie's exposed stomach. Jaapie falls back and gets the knife used for his tattooing right in his ass. Jaapie Botha bellows like an enraged bull as he grabs futiley for the embedded blade. His cohorts laugh, thinking it tremendously funny, until Jaapie removes the knife and turns with it, dripping his own blood, his eyes murderous. The laughter dies. Jaapie's breath comes hard. \nJAAPIE Hang him up! \nA few boys protest. \nBOYS Jaapie!   No! \nBut Botha is murderous, intent on revenge. \nJAAPIE Hang him! \nHe waves the bloody knife in the air. Three boys grab the six-year-old and drag him to where the chicken is hanging. Two more boys throw a rope over the same rafter. Others bind the struggling boy, trussing his hands to his sides. \nJAAPIE You will pay for the deaths of our grandfathers and grandmothers, our aunts and uncles. All Rooineks will pay and you will be first. Pull! \nThe boys who tied the rope now yank it over the rafter. The six-year-old is hoisted up until he is eye-level with the chicken. \nJAAPIE In the name of Adolf Hitler and the fatherland, I sentence you to die, Verdomde Rooinek. \nBOYS Kill him!   Kill him!   Kill him! \nJaapie swings the sling overhead, faster and faster. \n19   ANGLE ON SIX-YEAR-OLD                                         19 \nHe watches as Jaapie bears down. As Jaapie is about to let the rock fly the door to the room opens and two STAFF MEMBERS burst in, surprising in. \nSTAFF MEMBER What's this? \nThe rock flies from the sling, but Jaapie's attention is diverted. His aim is off. The rock grazes the boy above the eye. He loses consciousness. The scene FADES TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \n20   INT. ST. JOHN'S STUDY - DAY                                   20 Prince of Wales School, 1950. PK, 17     going on 18, well- built, intense, clear-eyed, handsome,    stands in front of a seminar and continues reading to 10    students, honor students, Headmaster St. John's chosen    few. St. John, with the demeanor of an Oxford don and    a mane of snowy white hair that reaches his shoulders,    sits off to the side, listening. \nPK I came to after being unconscious for two days, the rock missing my eye by half an inch. After a week in hospital it was decided I'd be sent to my grandfather's house in the English town of Barberton, at least until passions at school cooled. Jaapie Botha was expelled; sent home to his family's farm in disgrace. \nPK (CONT'D) (beat) And so the first recorded South African casualty of Hitler's insanity was not a Boer, nor a Rooinek, but a tatter-feathered, half-bald kaffir chicken. PK finishes. The end of class BELL RINGS. Offstage, other classrooms are exiting into the common hall, but no one in St. John's study moves. St. John takes his \nglasses off and wipes the lenses deliberately.   After a long moment he turns to face the class. \nST. JOHN Very evocative, yes. Particularly the image of the chicken. Good choice there. \nSt. John rises, lecturing. \nST. JOHN Any ideology that needs to attack the thing that least threatens it is an ideology that will not outlive its own generation. Inclusion, gentlemen, not exclusion, is the key to survival. (beat) Something our new government should take heed of, eh? \nHis eyes roam from face to face, fixing his point. \nST. JOHN Next week we have Mr. Levy who will enlighten us on... \nMORRIE, a bright-eyed kinetic, speaks up. MORRIE Sport and wager in Imperial Rome, sir. \nST. JOHN (facetious) Very apt, Mr. Levy. We look forward to the experience. (pause) All right. \nThe boys bolt for the door. ST. JOHN P.K. \nPK approaches. ST. JOHN Well-written. \nPK Thank you, sir. \nST. JOHN I've received notice from the \nOxford selection committee. You are to appear before them in three weeks. I assume you'll be reading a piece of your fiction as your presentational. PK Yes, sir. \nST. JOHN A word of caution. Contemporary to most of these fellows means the seventeenth century. Try and keep your theme, um, classical, if you know what I mean. \nPK Yes sir. I will. (beat) Will the scholarship be decided at the same time, sir? \nST. JOHN Money's a different matter. Different committee. \nPK Very good, sir. St. John picks up a book and opens the pages. He begins to read. PK takes it as a cue for his dismissal. He goes to exit. \nST. JOHN And P.K... \nPK turns at the door. \nMORRIE We're in a bloody war here, in \ncase you forgot. Let's keep our mind on that, hey? \nHe jams the mouthpiece into PK's mouth as the BELL RINGS. PK turns to an onslaught by Jannie, a real brawler. Jannie's big, overhand rights almost nail PK until he finds his footing and dances away. Jannie comes after him hard, his schoolmates bellowing encouragement. But PK's far superior boxing skills put Jannie at an immed- iate disadvantage. It is a classic battle of a boxer versus a fighter. PK's jabs keep Jannie at an arm's length, until he closes with a combination. Jannie, willing to take three punches to land one, absorbs PK's point scoring combinations and tries to land knockout punches. When he has had enough punishment he lunges into a clinch. \nJANNIE Blery Rooinek.     I'll kill you. \nPK pushes off as Jannie hammers at his kidneys. Backing up, PK repays the compliment with two quick jabs to the face. PK works Jannie, turning him left then right, working the angles, keeping him off balance while he racks up the points. Jannie goes left. As PK chases him that way his eyes fix on something out of the ring. \n25   HIS POV - REAR EXIT DOOR - TALL BLACK MAN                   25 \nwith a younger black companion of more average height, the only black faces in a crowd of 2,000 people. \n26   BACK TO SCENE                                               26 \nTheir presence distracts    PK for a split second, and in that split second Jannie    seizes the opportunity. He comes across with a big    right hand to PK's jaw. Jannie connects. PK goes down     hard. The crowd goes wild. Morrie leaps up and down    in the corner. MORRIE Get up!     Get up! \nBut PK is seeing double.    He shakes his head, trying to clear it. \nMORRIE Up!   Up! \n27   PK'S POV - JANNIE                                      27 \ndancing in his corner, sensing victory, the Ref over \nhim, counting. \n28   BACK TO SCENE                                             28 \nPK forces himself up.   The Ref checks him. \nREFEREE Okay.   Fight. \nJannie comes rushing in, banging PK with a series of hard rights, but dropping his left each time he throws one. PK absorbs the punishment as best he can, backing up, dancing away. Jannie is all over him just as the BELL RINGS. Jannie goes back to his corner, triumphant. PK goes back to his and sits down with a blank ex- pression. Morrie goes to work on a small cut over his eye. MORRIE What are you trying to do, bankrupt us? What happened? \nPK turns and looks at the two Africans at the rear door. Morrie's eyes follow him, tensing as he sees the two men. \nMORRIE Christ! If they get caught in here they're dead. (beat) What the hell's going on? \nPK I don't know. \nMORRIE Well, worry about it later. In case you haven't noticed, this Boer bastard is trying to kill you. \nPK You see the way he drops his left when he throws the right? \nMORRIE Yeah? \nThe BELL RINGS. PK and   Morrie trade a look. Jannie comes rushing over and  throws a big right. PK steps to his own right side and  pops Jannie right over his dropped left hand. He looks at   Morrie again. \n29   ANGLE ON MORRIE                                            29 \nMORRIE Thank you, God. \nJannie comes after PK, paying for each big right he throws as PK finds his mark. PK plants one, then two, then three punches on Jannie's face. Finally, frus- trated, Jannie forsakes all pretense of boxing and tries to nail PK with wild, flailing blows. PK bobs and weaves and feints. Jannie's punches grow weary. PK begins to bear down, driving his man back with rapid-fire com- binations until he delivers the coup de grace, a left hook to the heart and a driving right uppercut. Jannie goes down in a heap. The crowd goes wild. The Referee counts him out. Jannie's seconds rush into the ring to lift their fallen fighter. Morrie also rushes in, followed by the Prince of Wales boxing team. They hoist PK up on their shoulders. \n30   PK'S POV - MARIA MARAIS                                    30 \nrising from her seat, and leaving with the other girls. Their eyes meet. Her hint of a smile breaks his heart. She disappears in the crowd. \n31   BACK TO SCENE                                              31 \nPK's eyes rise to the rear exit.   The tall African and his companion have vanished. \nCUT TO: \n32   INT. LOCKER ROOM                                           32 \nThe boxing team and a number of their supporters are in raucous celebration. Morrie comes bouncing through the crowd, until he enters the empty dressing room in the rear, where PK is getting dressed. Morrie takes a wad of money out of his pocket. \nMORRIE Here you go, pal. He hands PK the money. \nPK You're the treasurer of this company. You hold it. Did you find out what I asked for? \nMORRIE \nUh, listen, P.K. You know in this world there is no greater proponent of sins of the flesh than Morrie Levy. But  do yourself a favor on this one.  Take my advice. Pass. PK Thanks for the advice.    The information please. \nMORRIE Do you know who her father is? Professor Daniel Marais. PK So? \nMORRIE So? He's the Nationalist Party's resident intellectual. The man is one of the architects of this damned system of -- what are they calling it? -- apartheid? He has about as much use for a Rooinek Englishman rutting after his daughter as the Queen does for balls, pardon my French. \nPK What's her name and where do I find her? \nMorrie sighs. MORRIE Maria Elizabete Marais, Seniors Cottage, Room 22, Devilliers School. They don't call it 'Fortress Virgin' for nothing. You'll never get in. \nPK slips his school blazer on. \nPK You going to take book on that? \nMORRIE Already have.    Three-to-one says you don't. \nPK Where'd you bet? \nDOC Again it begins. The stupidity. Do not be frightened. \nDoc puts na arm around PK's shoulder, drawing him close, comforting him. One of the soldiers pulls a pair of handcuffs out of his pocket as he advances. \nCUT TO: \n51   EXT. BARBERTON PRISON                                      51 \nA car pulls up. Doc, in shackles, is escorted from the car. PK exits after him. Two guards lead Doc toward the doorway to the prison, a square in the looming gates. Doc walks, his head held high. PK walks alongside holding his hand. \nBRITISH OFFICER (V.O.) Karl von Vollensteen, for the failure to register as an alien during times of war in accordance with His Majesty's government orders to do so, you are hereby sentenced to be confined at Barberton prison for the duration of the war with Germany. \nAt the door a guard touches PK's   shoulder, holding him back. The door opens. Doc goes     through. Just before the door closes he looks back at   PK one last time. The door slams shut. PK, with tears    streaming down his cheeks, is left outside. \nCUT TO: \n52   INT. PK'S ROOM - NIGHT                                     52 \nMorrie lies in bed, asleep.   PK sits up at his desk, writing. PK (V.O.) And again I was alone with nothing to depend on to see me through except the power of one. \nPK puts down his pen and sits, regarding the pages. He raises his eyes to a photo on the desk of a boy on a rock. \nPK smiles at hidden memories, caps his fountain pen, turns off the light. The room is pitched into darkness. \nCUT TO: \n53   EXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY - AFTERNOON                            53 \nThe seedy side of town. PK carrying a gym bag and Morrie looking a bit out of place in their school blazers come striding up the alley. \nMORRIE Look, even if the scholarship doesn't come through, my old man said he'd lend you the money. \nPK Morrie. \nMORRIE All right. All right. We'll call it the 'Levy Carpet Emporium Scholarship for Poor but Proud Christian Gentlemen.' How's that? \nPK Tell your father I appreciate the offer. MORRIE God, I hate people who can't be bought. \nPK Why is that? \nMORRIE I don't know.    Personality disorder. \nPK nods in agreement. \nPK Undoubtedly. \nThe boys come to their destination marked by a rickety, faded sign: \"GOLDMAN'S GYM.\" Excitement shines in PK's eyes. He bounds up the narrow flight of stairs. \nCUT TO: \n54   INT. STAIRCASE                                            54 \nMorrie and PK rush up the stairs, stop at the landing, and collect themselves before opening the door to the gym. They take a breath and enter. \nCUT TO: \n55   INT. GYM                                                  55 \nA down and dirty boxing gym, humming with the rhythm of \nmen training. Sweat and smoke fill the air along with the faint scent of blood. Fighters, both black and white, train with each other. Morrie is amazed. \nMORRIE How do they get away with this? \nBut PK has his mind on other things. His eyes fix on an OLD MAN across the room standing by ringside. \nPK There he is. \nMORRIE Christ, he's old. \nPK And he's the best.    C'mon. PK leads Morrie across the gym. PK passes an African fighter. He stops training when he sees PK. He turns to another African fighter, glancing at PK. One by one the blacks in the gym stop training to look at PK. PK and Morrie approach the rheumy Old Man yelling at the two fighters in the ring above him in a thick Polish- Jewish accent. \nSOLLY (OLD MAN) No, no. God gave you two hands so you can knock a man out from either side. Left-right. \nHe moves his creaky body back and forth to demonstrate. PK Mr. Goldman? Solly turns to the boys. A look of bemusement comes over his face when he sees their blazers. \nSOLLY What?    You boys lost? \nPK I'm the one who called you yesterday. From the Prince of Wales School? \nSOLLY Oh yeah, yeah.     The champeen. Right? PK (smiling) Right. \nSOLLY And who are you? \nMORRIE The champeen's manager. \nSolly rolls his eyes to heaven. \nSOLLY Oy gevalt. (beat) You know you train here it's not like those nice school fights you're used to. Three knockdowns you win. \nJust then, as if to underscore his point, one of the fighters in the ring gets caught witha solid shot to the jaw. He hits the canvas inches from where they are standing. Solly, PK and Morrie all look at him, and then at each other. \nMORRIE What does it cost for you to train him? \nCUT TO: \n62   INT. PRISON CORRIDOR                                      62 \nPK and Von Zyl walk together. \nVON ZYL We have cleared a little plot behind the cellblock for the cactus. And tomorrow we have the professor's piano moved here. There is not another instrument like it in the territory. Maybe one day the two of you can give a concert for us, hey? \nPK Yes, sir. \nJust then the sound of GRUNTING and THWACKING fills the air. PK passes a room set up as a boxing gym. Through a crack in the door he sees a dozen boys being coached by some guards. Some guards are also being coached by a second man. A third man, LIEUTENANT SMIT, oversees the whole training session. PK watches, mesmerized. \nVON ZYL You like to box? \nPK I would like to learn, meneer. Are the boys prisoners? \nVON ZYL (laughs) No, no. The sons of the guards. See that one there? (points to a \nlittle pudge boy flailing away) That's my son, Danie. It's a club. Lieutenant Smit. \nSmit comes over. \nSMIT Sir? \nVON ZYL We have room for one more on the squad? Smit looks down at PK. \nSMIT He's a little small, Kommandant. VON ZYL We'll build him up then. \nSMIT Yes, sir.   But I really don't have anyone  to spare to teach him right now.   You know, with the tournament  coming up. \nVON ZYL There must be someone. \nSmit looks around the hall. \n63   HIS POV                                                   63 \nA crumpled, old BLACK MAN, a lifer with broken, bandied legs and a fighter's flattened face, wiping the floor, picking up used towels. \n64   BACK TO SCENE                                             64 \nSMIT Piet. \nGEEL PIET comes shuffling over, properly submissive. \nGEEL PIET (BLACK MAN) Yes, sir. \nSMIT You teach this boy basics, and you teach him good or I knock your black head flat, you hear? \nGEEL PIET I teach him best I know, baas. \nSMIT We train every day. First thing in the morning. Miss two trainings, you're gone. \nPK Yes, meneer. \nSMIT Come tomorrow.     See this old kaffir. \nPK Yes, meneer.     Thank you, meneer. VON ZYL Lieutenant, a word? \nThe two men step off to the side. GEEL PIET Don't worry, little baas. Little can beat big any day. First with the head, then with the heart. Little defeat big when little is smart. You can remember that? \nPK Yes, sir. GEEL PIET No, no. Don't never call me sir. 'Specially in front of the guards. \nPK What should I call you? \nGEEL PIET Piet.   Geel Piet. \nCOACH Kaffir.   Towels. Geel Piet assumes his submissive posture again. \nGEEL PIET Okay, baas.    Coming, baas. He winks at PK and shuffles off.     A BELL SOUNDS. \nCUT TO: \n65   EXT. CARNIVAL                                             65 \nA bell at the top of a strongman's game sounds. A big Boer farmer, mallet in hand, roars in triumph, swinging the mallet again and ringing the bell again. \n66   ANGLE ON PK AND MARIA                                     66 walking through the carnival, munching popcorn. \nMARIA You took a big chance talking to my father the way you did. \nPK Not really. Going in I was behind on points with him. I'm English. I attend a politically suspect school. I'm a boxer. \nMARIA He likes boxers. \nPK All men like boxers. But not for their daughters. So I had to find some way to make an impression. \nThey get on line for the Ferris wheel. \nMARIA You could have picked a more agreeable topic. PK And made much less of an impression. Talk to someone about their passion. Even if they disagree they'll remember you. It was really the most logical strategy if you think about it. \nMARIA Do you spend hours thinking about how to deal with me, too? \nPK Days. MARIA Know what I think? (beat) \nGEEL PIET No, no.   Mustn't do that, little baas. \nPK I don't understand. \nDOC What Geel Piet means is it can be dangerous. Something the guards might not want the people to have. \nPK What's wrong with tobacco? Why wouldn't they want them to have it? \nDOC What's wrong is people whose job it is to punish. After a little while it is all they know how to do. \nPK What should I do? \nDOC This is for you to answer. \nThe sound of a TRUNCHEON on METAL turns them to the door where SERGEANT BORMANN, a side of beef with a sadist's eyes, stands, truncheon in hand. He enters the room and circles the trio. \nBORMANN I smell something not right here, ay, kaffir? He pokes Geel Piet with his truncheon. \nGEEL PIET (submissive) No, meneer sergeant. Everything okay here. \nBormann swings his truncheon into the back of Geel Piet's knees, buckling the little man to the floor. BORMANN I don't fuckin' believe you. \nHe glares at Doc and PK. BORMANN If you're up to something I'll find out. \nBormann, still eying them suspiciously, exits.     Doc and PK help Geel Piet up. \nDOC Schweinhund. \nGEEL PIET No, no.  This old kaffir's okay. Sorry to make any trouble, little baas. We  just stick to the boxing now on.  Sorry, sorry. \nGeel Piet goes hobbling off, picking up towels.     Doc and PK go to exit. At the door PK turns. \nPK Geel Piet. Geel Piet turns. \nPK I leave my bucket on the side by Doc's toilet when I practice piano. \nGeel Piet breaks out a smile he usually keeps to himself and exits. PK looks up at Doc who tossles his hair approvingly. \nDOC PK, to me you are the champion of the world already. Come. Let us go box now with Mr. Beethoven. \nPK and Doc exit. CUT TO: \n68   INT. SOLLY'S GYM                                               68 PK in the ring is about to start sparring.    Solly gives him instruction as Morrie stands by. \nSOLLY Now at the end of the Geel Piet eight you do this... one-two... (he punches the air) One-two-three... the Solly Goldman thirteen. Okay? \nPK nods. Solly hits the BELL.   The sparring begins.      PK works his way in. \nSOLLY That's it. That's it. Move him around. Jab jab. Slip slip. Now. PK pours it on, laying in the Geel Piet eight.   Solly is silently counting. \nSOLLY And... one-two... one-two-three. \nPK fires the last three punches like lightning and backs up. \nSOLLY That's it. That's it. Now work around the defense. Jab jab. The opponent becomes aggressive.   PK starts dancing, slipping punches. \nMORRIE How do you get away with this, Mr. G? Why don't they close you down? I mean, there are laws about blacks and white boxing each other. \nSOLLY In a public match. Not in a gym. Not yet anyway. The Boer is a funny people. Outside the ring the black is not equal. Inside he is. But only in private, not in public. So I keep my mouth shut, the police go a little blind, and that's that. It's a crazy world, huh? \nA WHISTLE from across the gym draws Solly's attention. He and Morrie turn to his office where his assistant stands with the tall black man from the Schoolboy Championships. Solly's face takes on a serious ex- pression. He rings the bell. He turns to Morrie. \nSOLLY Work him on the heavy bag. \nSolly heads for his office. \n69   ANGLE ON PK                                                 69 \nturning away from his opponent. He and the tall black man trade a glance just before the man enters Solly's \noffice and Solly closes the door. \nCUT TO: \n70   INT. GYM                                                    70 PK pounds the heavy bag as Morrie stands by. \nMORRIE Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That's it. \nPK stops, relaxing. Morrie throws a towel over his shoulders. One of Solly's ASSISTANTS comes over. \nASSISTANT Solly wants to see you two. \nPK and Morrie look at each other and head for Solly's office. \nCUT TO: \n71   INT. OFFICE                                                 71 \nSolly faces the door as it opens.    PK and Morrie enter. \nMORRIE You wanted to see us, Mr. G.? \nSOLLY Close the door. (beat) Someone I got a lot of respect for asked me to make a request. He wants to put you in a match. MORRIE With who? \nPK moves Maria and Morrie off down the stairs. \nMARIA Do you box too, Morrie? \nMORRIE Do I look that daft? \nPK Morrie's the brains of the operation. \nMORRIE He means the bank. Your boyfriend has a great head for literature but none for finance. \nThey exit the staircase. \n75   THEIR POV - ACROSS THE WAY - NGUNI                        75 \nin the shadow of the alley stands, smoking a cigarette. \n76   BACK TO SCENE                                     76 \nPK (in Zulu) I see you, Nguni. \nNGUNI I see you, P.K. \nThey talk across the narrow street. \nNGUNI You have heard my request? \nPK Yes.    Why do you make it? \nNGUNI A woman has thrown the sacred ox bones. She has made a fire and read the smoke. \nPK What did she read? \nNGUNI That the Onoshobishobi Ingelosi who is a chief must fight the one who one day will be a chief. \nPK But it's not true that I'm a chief. \nNGUNI Who knows what is true and what is not. The legend of Onoshobishobi Ingelosi is very powerful among the people. They see you box the Boer and always you win. They have heard the stories from Barberton. The people live with little hope. They must see if the spirit of the boy still lives in the man. PK And   if I lose? If the spirit of the   Onoshobishobi Ingelosi does not   exist in me anymore, then what will   they live with? \nNGUNI Less hope.   But still they must \nsee.   It is our way. \nAt that moment a spotlight blinds them. A police car comes up the alley, stopping in front of them. The POLICE exit, threatening. POLICE #1 What's this here? \nMaria is gripped by fear.     Morrie is cautious, unmoving. PK An old family servant, Officer. From home. We just ran into each other. \nPOLICE #2 Papers, man.   Come on, be quick. Nguni reaches into his pocket. \nPOLICE #1 Where you coming from? PK Gym, sir.   I train there. \nPOLICE #1 And you? \nMORRIE I'm his manager. \nThe Police look at each other and share a laugh. \nPOLICE #2 (to Maria) And you're the sparring partner, hey? \nThe Police laugh. Police #2, satisfied Nguni's papers are in order, hands them back. \nPOLICE #2 You have an hour to curfew and a long way to go, kaffir. Be off. NGUNI (subservient) Yes, baas. Going right now. \nNguni moves off, no semblance of the proud man in his gait. \nPK \nNguni. \nNguni turns. \nPK I'll do it. \nNguni smiles and disappears into the night.    PK watches him go. \nCUT TO: \n77   EXT. DEVILLIERS SCHOOL                                      77 \nPK and Maria stand by the tree set to climb over the wall. \nMARIA I'm scared for you, PK. \nPK Solly's a great teacher. He wouldn't put me in a fight I couldn't handle. \nMARIE I mean about how involved you are with the black people. That scares me. \nPK Because you don't understand them. MARIA No I don't. PK If you did you wouldn't be so scared. You ever have a conversation with a black person? MARIA Of course. \nPK Besides a servant. \nMaria's silence is her answer. \nPK You should sometime. \nGEEL PIET Not possible. The kommandant never allow the people to have such a thing. \nDOC He'll think it's a concert for him and the brass. But we'll know, ay? And the people will know. \nPK He'll never let black be with white here, Doc. \nDOC If the black is part of the \norchestra, like the piano, he will. \nGEEL PIET But the people have no instruments in this place, big baas. \nDOC They have their voices. Each tribe a different voice, a different language -- all singing together. It is brilliant, no? \nPK Except the tribes don't trust each other. They don't even talk to each other. \nDOC (crestfallen) Oh. This is correct.    This stupid hatred. \nGEEL PIET They will do it for you, kleine baas. You are Onoshobishobi Ingelosi. You bring the tobacco. You write the letters. You put clothes on their children's bodies and food in their bellies. All you do is ask and they all sing for you. \nDOC He's right. Wunderbar.    You are the smartest of us all. Geel Piet smiles as he lifts the watering pot to exit.   A truncheon stops him. All turn to Sergeant Bormann. \nBORMANN A kaffir smarter than all of us? You are a strange German, Professor. \nDOC That little maniac with the moustache in Berlin you admire. He is the strange German. And soon kaput, I hope. \nBORMANN If that's true you'll not be long for this place, eh, Professor? \nDOC No, Sergeant.    God willing. \nBORMANN And you, too, little Rooinek.     But you, kaffir, Hitler comes or goes... \nHe takes Geel Piet's hand. \nBORMANN You are going to stay with me. \nHe forces Geel Piet's hand closer and closer to a cactus with long thorns. \nBORMANN And I will find out all your secrets once your friends are gone. One slip... \nHe pushes Geel Piet's hands onto the cactus needle.        Geel Piet does not cry out. BORMANN I have you. \nHe lets go of Geel Piet's hand.     Geel Piet removes it from the cactus, bloodied. \nBORMANN Get out of here. \nGeel Piet takes his watering can and goes. \nBORMANN You see, Professor, they are not like us. A white man would scream bloody murder. \nDoc and PK glare at Bormann.    He smirks and walks away. PK (V.O.) As the weeks went by and the date for the concert grew closer, my life was a whirlwind. PK and Geel Piet appear before various tribal leaders, talking, agreeing, shaking hands. \nPK (V.O.) Having obtained the cooperation of all the tribal groups, we set about instructing them. Four men from each tribe were taught the \nintricacies of their group's parts. They were the choral leaders responsible for teaching the others. \nPK and Doc instruct. Doc plays the piano. PK leads the singers. Geel Piet turns the pages for Doc. \nPK (V.O.) At night the prison hummed with the men in their cells practicing. \nCUT TO: \n83   EXT. PRISON TOWER                                         83 \nNervous guards patrol as the SOUNDS of the prisoners singing wafts through the air. \nCUT TO: \n84   INT. BOXING ROOM                                               84 \nGeel Piet instructs PK. \nP.K. (V.O.) My boxing instruction accelerated as well. It was as if Geel Piet was trying to give me every bit of boxing knowledge he had before we parted. And always from the corners and shadows Bormann watched and waited. Bormann watches PK and Geel Piet from the door of his room, his truncheon beating idly against his leg. \nCUT TO: \n85   INT. RING                                                      85 \nA photographer sets up a group picture of the boxing squad -- kids and guards. Geel Piet stands off to one side, OUT OF FRAME. \nPK (V.O.) Our boxing squad, the Barberton Blues, won the State Championship with a perfect record. I won at 100 lbs. It was my first championship. It made me want \nmore. \nThe group disperses. PK beckons the photographer to wait. He grabs Geel Piet and forces him to stand, much to the little man's protestations, for a photo of the two of them. As the picture is taken Geel Piet has the widest smile imaginable. \n86   INT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT                              86 The guards, all in crisp uniforms, patrol nervously, truncheons at the ready. The towers bristle with guns as hundreds of black prisoners file into the yard. \nPK (V.O.) Finally the night of the concert arrived. The prison atmosphere, normally tense, was keening. Each prisoner entering the yard is searched. It was prison policy to keep tribal rivalries boiling. Divide and conquer. The policy of control. \nPK (V.O.) (CONT'D) This was to be the first time in the history of the South African prison system that the tribes were allowed to mingle. And if trouble came, it would be the last. \nAll the prisoners are seated on the ground behind Doc, who is raised with the piano on a small stage. Guards surround the prisoners -- a solid, edgy border encasing a black center. The front of the yard is filled with seats on which sit the Kommandant, his wife, assorted prison brass, politicians, and a smattering of the local Afrikaan Hierarchy. PK is overseeing the seating of the prisoners when Doc comes up to him. DOC Have you seen my page turner? \n109   PK                                                         109 \nstruggles to mount the fifth rock. He clings to it, wet, exhausted, as the water pummels him. \nCUT TO: \n110   REFEREE                                                        110 \nREFEREE ... seven... eight... nine... \nPK rises.    The crowd goes wild.      The Referee holds up six fingers. \nREFEREE How many fingers? PK Six. REFEREE Where are you? \nPK In a fight behind on points. \nREFEREE Okay.   Continue. \nMandoma rushes in for the kill. PK feints and comes up under one of Mandoma's punches, burying a body shot into his gut. Mandoma grunts and backs up. PK pursues him. Mandoma tries to recover. He throws another big punch. PK ducks under it and puts two more hooks into Mandoma's stomach. Mandoma starts to back up for the first time in the fight. PK boxes, jabbing, feinting, pushing Man- doma around the ring, taking control. Mandoma, heading for exhaustion, throws another big punch in desperation. PK hits him with three punches in return. Mandoma swings again with a last desperate effort, and PK buries the Solly Goldman thirteen into every part of his body. PK steps back and with his last punch, puts Mandoma down. The crowd goes silent. The Referee counts Mandoma out. He raises PK's hand. Still, the crowd is silent. \nMORRIE We're in the shit now.      Nice knowing you, Solly. \nHe and Solly look around at       the somber black faces flick- ering in the shadows of the       ring light. PK looks  down at Mandoma in silence. Mandoma        rises unsteadily. He  stands in front of PK, staring into       his eyes, and then he raises PK's arm above his head. \nMANDOMA Onoshobishobi Ingelosi. The crowd goes wild, chanting, singing over and over as PK and Mandoma stand in center ring, arms raised. \n111   EXT. DEVILLIERS SCHOOL - PRE-DAWN                             111 \nPK stands with Maria by the tree they use to climb over the wall. In the b.g. Solly and Morrie wait in the car. MARIA The Seniors Dance is two Saturdays from now. I would like it if you could escort me. PK Maria Marais with a rooinek at the Senior Dance? What will people think? \nMARIA They'll think what they think and I'll think what I think. \nPK And what is that? \nMaria touches his face.   Her eyes soften. \nMARIA I think I love you. \nPK swallows hard.   They kiss and embrace.     PK caresses her face. \nPK I would be honored to be your escort. \nMaria beams. MARIA I didn't doubt it for a minute. \nSolly HONKS the HORN. PK kisses Maria once more. \nPK I'll give you a boost. PK stirrups his hands. Maria boosts up to the first branch of the tree. She crests the wall. \nMARIA Thank you for tonight.    You were great. \nShe smiles and drops down behind the wall.     PK runs back \ntoward the car. \nCUT TO: \n112   EXT. PRINCE OF WALES SCHOOL - DAWN                               112 \nSolly's car pulls up opposite the gate. \nCUT TO: \n113   INT. CAR                                                         113 Morrie is sleeping in the back seat.         Solly and PK are sitting in the front. \nSOLLY When you and your manager first came to me with that meshuganah idea to be welterweight champion of the world you did not have a big believer here. But I gotta tell you. Now you do. In London lives Benny Rosen, the greatest trainer in the world today. When you go to your Oxford I give you a letter to Rosen. Whatever I can't do for you, he can. \nPK Thanks, Mr. G. \nSolly pokes Morrie awake. \nSOLLY And I give the address of a very good bookmaker. Teach you also a thing or two. Now, go on back to being fancy-schmancy English gentlemen. I'm proud of both of you. \nPK and Morrie exit the car and run back to the school. \n114   EXT. CAMPUS                                                      114 \nAs PK and Morrie jog toward their dorm a VOICE stops them from behind. \nST. JOHN (V.O) Gentlemen. \nPK and Morrie stop cold.      They turn to St. John, up early \nfor his daily constitutional. \nMORRIE You're up early, sir. \nST. JOHN Best time for walking. \nPK Best time for running too, sir. MORRIE Have to put in the roadwork, sir. You know, keep those legs strong. \nSt. John eyes the bruise on PK's cheek. \nST. JOHN Yes.   Quite a fresh bruise there. \nPK It's a permanent obligation. Every Saturday night... (beat) It starts tonight. \nMaria cannot believe what she is hearing. \nMARIA You're breaking up with me. \nPK No. \nMARIA Then what could be so important that it takes all your Saturday nights? \nPK I really can't say. Maria starts to cry.   She throws her arm around him. \nMARIA \nP.K., I love you.     Please don't go away. \nPK I'm not going away. MARIA Yes you are.   I can feel it. \nPK I'm not.   I'm just tutoring. \nMaria pulls back. PK I started a school... (beat) ... for Gideon Mandoma and some others in the seniors library. \nMaria's sadness turns to anger. \nMARIA I'm losing you to a bunch of kaffirs? \nPK You're not losing anything. MARIA No? Are you escorting me to the dance? Are you going to see me on the only free night they give us? PK Maria, this is important to me. MARIA And my life's important to me. Damn you. \nShe runs off in tears.   A pained PK doesn't attempt to go after her. \nFADE TO. \n118   EXT. CLIFF FACE                                            118 \nOn an escarpment high above the dense green rainforest cover, PK and Doc move along the sheer cliff face with photographic equipment and rucksacks. \nPK notices Doc's labored breathing and slow movements. They reach some small cacti growing out of the side of \nthe cliff in full bloom. \nDOC (breathing hard) Ach.   You see how beautiful? PK You ever hear of glycerine, Doc? \nDOC Mr. Going-To-Oxford-Smarty-Pants. Of course I know about glycerine. Triglycerine. Biglycerine. Monoglycerine. What do you want to know? \nPK Why you don't use it. It's only a little pill under the tongue. \nDOC Tongues were not made to put little pills under. When I have to start with that, I become something else. \nPK Well, until you become something else, the little pills would make this easier on your heart. \nA CLAP of THUNDER cuts into their conversation.   Thick roiling rain clouds appear suddenly. DOC Little pills or no little pills -- we don't find cover, we both turn into something else. \nLightning splits the sky.   Rain begins to fall, pelting the escarpment. DOC Look for a cave. Always in this kind of rock there is caves. Quick! Quick! PK starts to move horizontally across the cliff face like a spider on a wall. Doc follows. The rain becomes torrential. \nPK turns to look back at Doc. \nDOC Don't look at me.     Go! \nPK forges ahead. \n119   HIS POV - OPENING                                         119 some 20 yards ahead. \n120   BACK TO SCENE                                                   120 PK I've found something. The rain is so heavy PK can barely make out Doc behind him. When he can, he sees the old man pause, breathing hard. PK makes his way back to Doc. Halfway there, Doc waves him forward and starts to move. PK reaches the small opening and slips in. \nCUT TO: \n121   INT. SMALL CAVE                                                 121 \nPK stoops in the small cave, dripping wet. A moment later Doc's foot appears at the entrance. PK helps him in. Doc slumps down, exhausted. PK You okay? \nBreathing too   hard to reply, Doc shakes his head in the affirmative.    PK looks out at the rain forming a sheer wall of water   outside. He turns to Doc, who is getting up, flashlight   in hand. PK What are you doing? \nDOC Exploring. \nPK Why don't you just rest? \nDOC Plenty time for resting when I am something else. Look. \nHe strikes a match.    A wind from inside the cave blows it side to side. \nDOC When does a cave have wind?    This \nis more than some little cave, my friend. \nDoc crouches down and follows the beam of his flashlight to the rear of the cave where there is a small opening. He shines the light into it. \nDOC Here.   See?   There is a passage. \nBefore PK can say anything else, Doc has wriggled through the small opening. \nPK, a bit peeved, takes his own flashlight and follows. \nCUT TO: \nDOC Come try it. \n128   WIDER ANGLE                                                128 \nPK (short) No.   That's all right.   Can we go? \nDOC We have only just gotten here. What's the matter, P.K.? \nPK All day long you've been talking about becoming something else, about dying. You never talked about dying before. \nDOC I'm 87 next month.   It's natural. \nPK Not to a sixteen-year-old it's not. It's painful. \nDoc realizes what PK is saying. DOC You are right. I am sorry. Sixteen-year-old ears should only hear life. Doc starts to whistle \"The Marriage of    Figaro\" by Mozart. The RESONANCE of the WHISTLING off the    crystal sounds beautiful, exotic. Doc beckons PK to     join in with him. PK does so, hesitantly. Then pleased     with the sound and the feeling, more fully. \nDoc and PK exit through the stalactites, whistling. CUT TO: \n129   INT. DOC'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                 129 PK and a very exhausted Doc enter. Doc sits down heavily on the bed while PK, shrugging off his rucksack, heads right for the small kitchen area. \nPK I'll just set you up with some coffee here, so in the morning you won't have to bother making it. \nHe begins to prepare the coffee. \nPK I didn't mean to tell you what \nyou can and can't talk about back in the cave today. I guess I just don't like to think of you being... (beat) PK (CONT'D) ... becoming... (beat) ... something else. I know it's natural law and it's the way it is with everybody... (beat) I just wish it weren't with you. \nThere is no reply. \nPK Doc? \nPK turns to Doc, dead asleep, still sitting up. PK goes over and gently lays the old man down. He removes his boots and throws a blanket over him. PK blows out the kerosene lamp and goes to exit. He is about to hang their two rucksacks on two hooks by the door when Doc's voice turns him. \nDOC P.K.? \nPK I'm here, Doc. \nDOC The crystal cave will be our secret, ja? PK Whatever you say. \nDOC Promise. \nPK I promise. \nDOC Ja.  Good. I rest a little. (beat) The heart of Africa, P.K. \nDoc lays down. \nDOC The heart. \nHe is asleep when his head hits the pillow. \nPK watches Doc's chest, washed in moonlight, rise and fall lightly. A sudden sadness falls over him. The corners of his mouth turn up in a bittersweet smile. He finishes hanging the rucksack and exits. \nCUT TO: \n130   EXT. PRINCE OF WALES BACK GATE - NIGHT                       130 \nPK and Morrie stick close in the shadows. PK looks at his watch and then twenty feet away to the locked gate. \nMORRIE Christ! If someone would have told me this is where I'd be on a Saturday night, last term of my senior year, I'd call them batty. (beat) You know, you're going to owe me for the rest of your life on this one. PK That all? I figured you'd hold me to it longer. \nMORRIE You get the insider friend's rate. PK Thanks, mate. \nA black groundskeeper comes walking along, seemingly on his duties. \nPK pokes Morrie. \n131   THEIR POV - GROUNDSKEEPER                                    131 \nwalks up to the gate. He looks left and right, then quickly unlocks it. He walks away. \n132   BACK TO SCENE                                                132 \nPK and Morrie advance.    PK opens the gate.   As he does, \nGideon Mandoma, followed by 15 men and 5 women, enters. \nMANDOMA I see you, P.K. \nPK I see you, Gideon. \nMORRIE Let's get inside before the whole bloody world sees us. \nMANDOMA Morrie. \nHe clasps Morrie's hand, first in a traditional hand- shake, then in an African handshake. Mandoma smiles. \nMANDOMA You some great friend. \nMorrie is taken by his sincerity. \nPK Let's go.    Stay to the fence. \nCUT TO: \n139   INT. SCHOOL GYM                                           139 \nPK is working on a speed bag. Morrie comes running in with two open letters in hand. \nMORRIE We made it!   We made it! \nHe thrusts one of the letters at PK. \nMORRIE Sorry. I couldn't bear the suspense after I read mine.   I had to open it. PK looks at his letter. \nMORRIE Three months and we're out of here. \nPK You're out of here. \nMORRIE What the hell are you talking about? \nHe snatches PK's letter. MORRIE (reading) 'Dear sir. It is our pleasure to inform you that you have been accepted to matriculate at Trinity College, Oxford,' etc., etc., etc. PK It says nothing about the scholarship. \nMORRIE A technicality. \nAnother BOY comes over. \nBOY St. John wants to see you two in his study. \nMORRIE Good news travels fast. \nPK I'll get showered and changed. \nBOY He said to come as you are.

PK Wanted to see us, sir? \nST. JOHN Yes.   Come in.     Close the door. \nAs the door closes, BRIGADIER JOHANNES BRETYN, a quiet but formidable man, comes into their line of vision. Trouble is in the air. ST. JOHN This is Brigadier Bretyn from the police department. \nBretyn just nods his head. \nST. JOHN He has come to deliver, in person, an order to close the Saturday school. \nPK Why? \nBRETYN Because it is illegal. \nMORRIE We're only teaching them how to read and do sums. \nBRETYN You don't have certification to do that. \nPK Prince of Wales is a certified school. \nBRETYN Yes.   But not certified for that \nsort of thing. \nPK Can he do this, sir? \nBRETYN Of course I can do it. Would I be here if I couldn't? Come now meneer headmaster. Let's end this now. I have a full day ahead of me still. \nSt. John meets Bretyn's steely eyes.   He cannot hold the man's gaze. \nST. JOHN (resigned) The Saturday school is to be disbanded until further notice. \nBRETYN Thank you, meneer headmaster. Your cooperation in this matter is very appreciated. Good day. \nBretyn goes to exit. \nPK You know it can't go on like this forever. \nSt. John tenses. \nBRETYN What can't? \nPK What you're doing. \nBRETYN I'm just doing my job. And if you'll take some advice, you should just do yours. \nBretyn exits. \nMORRIE Is that really the end of it, sir? \nST. JOHN For the moment I'm afraid it is. PK If we let them get away with it on our own grounds, it will never \nchange.   It'll just get worse. \nST. JOHN History disputes you. \nThe groundskeeper opens the door to the basement.

He taps on the window. Maria comes to the     window and sees him. Her face lights up. She opens      the window. \nPK (cool) I was in the neighborhood.

MARIA (whispering) They're sending me away to school in Pretoria. I told my father I wouldn't go. He said if I didn't he'd see they arrest you and ruin your chances. I couldn't let him do that. \n150   ANGLE ON PK'S PAINED FACE                                       150 \nas he holds Maria. PK When do you go? \nMARIA Next week.

They look at each other. \nMARIA I do. \nPK leans forward and kisses her, awkward, as if for the first time. As their lips part, their breath shortens. Maria moves forward slowly, lifting PK's hand to her breast. He touches it. The heat builds. Passion overwhelms them. They begin to make love. \nCUT TO: \n151   INT.

PK If you'll all be seated we can begin. \nThe Africans head toward their desks.    PK turns to Morrie. \nPK So far so good. \nTwo other police beat Morrie from behind.   He goes down once again under their brutal clubs. \n157   BACK TO SCENE                                             157 \nPK turns just as another club comes for his head. He slips past the blow and punches out his assailant with a lightning combination. As the man falls another cop charges from behind. \nMARIA PK! \nPK turns off-balance. Maria leaps. The club cuts through the air. Maria is caught flush on the forehead as she comes between PK and the club. She falls to the floor dead. PK swings a stool with all his might, breaking the cop's face open. PK Maria! \nPK drops to the fallen girl's side. He is frantic at the sight of her gaping bloody wound and the sight of her open blank eyes. The battle raging around him recedes before his pain and rising rage. All at once he explodes, screaming like a madman. \nHe leaps at Bretyn and bangs one punch after another into the startled man. Bretyn's face is broken over and over against PK's fists. Still PK keeps pounding blow after blow into the fallen man. \nThree cops descend on PK and beat him mercilessly until he drops to the floor, unconscious. \nMandoma is hit hard and goes down. \nThe few Africans left fighting go down before the withering assault of clubs, fists, and boots. \n158   EXT.

As Marais looks up he sees PK standing behind the mourners, 20 yards off. His anger replaces grief. \nMarais advances towards PK, clutching the shovel as a weapon. Several MEN restrain him. MEN Daniel.    No. Marais glares at PK. \nAll of a sudden a thousand African voices cut through the air, SINGING songs of mourning. CUT TO: \n159   EXT. CEMETERY WALL                                        159 Thousands of Africans and a smattering of whites have gathered outside the cemetery.

He picks one up off the desk and looks at it. \nMORRIE \n(surprised) You're applying to South African universities? \nPK In case the scholarship doesn't come through. \nMORRIE Why are you so bloody stubborn? You don't belong in a South African university any more than I belong in the priesthood. Will you take my father's loan? \nPK takes the applications back just as a TELEGRAPH DELIVERY BOY comes to the door. \nBOY There a Mr. P.K. here? \nMORRIE It's your scholarship. Morrie grabs the telegram. \nBOY Sign here.   Odd name -- P.K. MORRIE What's your name? \nBOY Waldo. \nMORRIE You're not one to talk about names. \nMorrie scribbles his signature and proceeds to open the telegram. PK snatches it away from him.

Nothing is out of place. \nVON ZYL Since his pneumonia last year I've had one of the men drop by once a week to see if he needed anything. Of course you know the professor. He never did. PK looks out at the cactus garden, watered now by drip irrigation. VON ZYL At the beginning of the week he wasn't home so I decided to drop by myself. Waited a whole day here. When he didn't come back I sent search parties. After three days I sent the telegram. Seven days is a long time for him to be gone. Do you have any ideas where he went? \nPK looks at the pegs where the rucksacks hang.    There is only one hanging. \nCUT TO: \nCUT TO: \n173   EXT.

He opens the door to Daniel Marais, sitting at his desk, reading from his fiction-filled notebook. \nMARAIS You're a very good writer. The subject matter is a little inflammatory but the style is interesting. \nPK What are you doing here? MARAIS I came to inform you that you will not be receiving aid from the National Scholarship Fund. Neither will you be admitted to any of the South African universities. Here are your applications back. \nHe hands PK the applications as he rises. \nMARAIS I told you when you came to my house. I am first a member of my tribe and I will defend it any way I know how. \nHe and PK glare at each other, implacable enemies. Marais exits. \nPK looks out his window, thinking. \n175   HIS POV - MARAIS                                          175 \nwalking off across the campus. \nMORRIE (O.S.)

Let's leave. \nPK If I leave or if I stay in South Africa it's because I choose to, not because they choose for me. \nHe takes a small handbag, throws a few books into it and Doc's picture. He picks up his notebook and packs that too. He goes to exit. MORRIE Where are you going? \nPK Save my place at Oxford. \nPK exits the room. \nMorrie chases after him. MORRIE P.K., goddammit! \nHe grabs PK, stopping him. PK Save my place. Morrie's grip releases. \nPK walks out. \nFADE TO: \n177   EXT. COPPER MINE - DAY                                       177 \nHundreds upon hundreds of black laborers and white mine workers descend into the mines. A milling mass of disenfranchised humanity come to work the underground hell of the copper mines. \nPK exits the management shack and walks through the crowd. \nPK (V.O.) Dear Morrie.     Here is how it works. \nThe copper of the mines in Northern Rhodesia is mined below ground. All day a behemoth of a man, a diamond driller, works a stope which is like the top of a funnel. \nCUT TO: \n178   INT. STOPE                                              178 \nA huge diamond driller at work drilling and blasting in the stope. \nPK (V.O.) Setting charges and drilling the rock. The only way for the raw ore he takes from the sides of the stope to get to the haulage below is to pass through the spout of a funnel and out the steel doors at the bottom -- sixty feet down. \nCUT TO: \n179   TRAPPED DOORS AT BOTTOM OF FUNNEL                             179 \nopening, as the haulage cart fills with ore and moves away on the track in the tunnel below. \nPK (V.O.) Halfway down the spout area is a set of six tungsten steel bars called a grizzly which catch all the rocks too large to make it through the funnel mouth to safe haulage. \n180   ANGLE ON GRIZZLY                                              180 \nsix bars with men working them. \nPK (V.O.) These are taken care of by a grizzly, an explosives expert whose job it is to keep the ore flowing, and since when the ore doesn't flow, neither does the money, working the grizzly is a very crucial and therefore very well-paid position. Three months' \nwork earns a year's    stay at Oxford. Yesterday,     on receiving my blasting license    from the School of Mines, I    signed on to work the bars for a    year. CUT TO: \n181   INT. MINER'S BAR                                            181 A crude place where the bar runs the back length of the room and the bare concrete surroundings offer nothing in the way of diversion from the main purpose of being there -- to drink hard and long. \nTHOMAS, a harsh, ruddy-faced Welshman, the School of Mines instructor, downs a drink, pours another and looks up at PK. \nTHOMAS Are you crazy?     To sign on for a year? PK You said I was the best you ever taught, sir. \nTHOMAS And you are, boyo. The absolute best. \nTHOMAS (CONT'D) But even the best doesn't survive a year on the bars. Down in that damn tube the luck runs out sooner than later. You may be a genius at reading the rock but you ain't no fuckin' fortune teller. \nany shared interests. But they do exist and even flourish. Except between the drillers and their grizzlies. No one wants to get too close to the man who might be buried at night by what you drilled loose in the day. \nCUT TO: \n185   EXT.   MINE - NIGHT                                          185 \nPK inspects his nightly quota of gelignite charges and fuses. \nFive Africans, all serious faces, keep their eyes firmly on PK. PK (V.O.) The Africans who come here looking for work are driven by a different desperation--drought, famine, locusts. \nSatisfied with the equipment, PK nods for the box to be closed. \nELIJAH, his head man, closes the boxes. \nPK (V.O.) They come and risk their    lives to send money back home to    the families sitting on the    barren farms, starving, waiting    for death or rain. When the boxes are closed the other five men in the crew lift them and follow PK out. \nCUT TO: \n186   INT. MINE ELEVATOR                                           186 \nThe elevator descends into the mine. PK (V.O.) Superstition runs deep in them, so a good grizzly man attracts a good crew. On the bars, the longer you live the luckier you are. And by association -- they are. \nCUT TO: \n187   INT. TUNNEL                                               187 \nPK and his crew make their way through a narrow tunnel and come to the grizzly. It is dark. The only light comes from the lamps attached to their helmets. Boulders litter the bars. \nPK and Elijah are onto the bars first.   Their light beams move along across the boulders. \nELIJAH Baas.   Baas. \nPK turns to Elijah. His lamp catches Elijah's face which is looking upward. PK looks up. \nHis POV in the narrow bands of light: a bunch of rocks big and small, packed into the funnel. His face grows dim. \nCUT TO: \n188   CLOSEUP ON HANGUP OF ROCKS                                188 \nFive feet across a rock wall with stones of all sizes blocking up the funnel's mouth. \nPK (V.O.) Hangups are the worst of it. When the top of the funnel gets blocked up and the ore won't flow. \nPK scales the sheer rock wall of the funnel, his shirt packed with explosives. \nPK (V.O.) The only way to unblock it is to set a charge to blow inward. And the only way to do that is to set the charge in mud, which means climbing up to the mouth of the stope and coming face-to-face with the devil. \nPK reaches the hangup. He works at taking a prepared parcel of gelignite sticks and jamming them carefully into a crevice. As he does the hangup creaks deeply, shifting, ominous. A few rocks fall. PK freezes, holding his breath. \nCUT TO: \n189   THE AFRICANS                                               189 \npeeking out of the safety shaft below, terrified. Elijah remains on the grizzly bars, his light shining on PK. \nCUT TO: \n190   PK                                                         190 \nholding very still, listening. PK (V.O.) Sometimes the rock doesn't need the provocation of explosives. Sometimes the earth shifts... (beat) a pebble moves... (beat) you talk too loud... (beat) and in the moment before you are turned into something else by fifty tons of rock you understand why it is called grizzly. \nPK finishes setting the charge. He scales down the wall. A large rock is expelled from the hangup and comes bouncing down the sides to the funnel, just missing PK, crashing through the bars below. \nPK freezes. Elijah holds his breath.   The crew in the safty tunnel quakes. \nNothing happens. \nPK comes down the rest of the way. He takes the cordtex rope dangling from the bomb and inserts a fuse. He nods to Elijah. Elijah lights a cheesa stick. He hands the glowing stick to PK. PK waves towards the tunnel. One of the Africans sounds the WARNING WHISTLE. Two blasts followed by two blasts. PK nods for Elijah to be off. Elijah stands his ground. \nELIJAH I wait for you, baas. \nPK lights the fuse. Elijah takes off like a scared rabbit for the safety of the shaft. PK is right on his tail. \nThe fuse travels quickly toward the bomb. \nElijah trips. PK, coming behind him, grabs him by the collar and flings him into the safety tunnel, diving after him a second later, just as the BOMB EXPLODES. A few rocks come down, but nothing else. The Africans look at each other with real apprehension. \nPK rises from Elijah and peeks out. \n191   HIS POV - HANGUP                                           191 \nis still in place. \nPK studies the hangup, stepping out onto the grizzly, listening, looking. The hangup groans. The Africans are petrified at the mouth of the tunnel. PK stops midway on the bars. He studies the hangup intently, then picks up a rock. Choosing a target he heaves the rock with all his might toward the hangup and runs like hell. The rock hits the hangup. PK springs off the grizzly, right into the Africans as the hangup thunders down. Dust and small rocks fill the safety tunnel. \nWhen the avalanche has stopped PK raises himself off the Africans. They are all covered in dust but smiling and babbling, happy to be alive. \nPK peeks out and up. He signals to Elijah who hits the LL-CLEAR WHISTLE. Three blasts. PK Let's clean her off and call it a night, hey? \nHappy, the Africans lift shovels and crowbars to clear the bars. As they pass PK they touch him reverentially as one would an icon. PK (V.O.) The Africans think the longer you survive the luckier you are. And the luckier you are the longer you survive. I know there's something inherently wrong with their logic. Still, I'm beginning to see their point. Especially with less than six months to go. CUT TO: \n192   INT.

He carefully makes his way to Elijah as the hangup sends some pebbles down. \nPK She's playing with us tonight. Fuse set? \nElijah nods. \nPK holds his hand out for the cheesa stick. Elijah lights the flare. He goes to hand it to PK. PK notices Elijah's hands shaking. He sees the fear in Elijah's eyes. PK Go on. \nELIJAH I stay with you, baas. \nPK That's an order. \nElijah, released from his responsibility, retreats quickly. \nPK stands holding the flare, a little distracted by Elijah's fear, wondering. Elijah sounds the BLAST WHISTLE. \nPK One... two... three. A MUFFLED BLAST comes from the other side of the hangup deep in the stope. PK freezes, confused, and then a SECOND BLAST goes off. The hangups starts to give. And ANOTHER BLAST. \nPK lights his own fuse and runs like hell over the bars toward the tunnel. The hangup, loosened by the explosions inside, gives before PK's bomb ignites. The rock is crashing down. PK races the rock. The tunnel is within sight. \nThe men yell for him to jump. \nPK is about to leap when a rock hits the bar, bounces up, and catches him in the stomach. He  loses his balance and goes over the side as the hangup comes crashing down. PK hits the wall of the lower funnel -- once, twice -- and then lands in the soft stuff -- the shale flake, cushioning the steel doors below. \n200   HIS POV                                                    200 \nagainst the wall of rock. \nA rock ledge carelessly left when the funnel was originally built. \nPK rolls under it.

MARAIS HOUSE                                      39 An ample house. PAN ACROSS a gallery of oil paintings depicting great moments in Boer history -- the Great Trek, an endless progression of oxcarts heading north, the Battle of Blood River against the Zulu armies, the hang- ing of Boer farmers by British regulars. Women and children herded into a detention camp as their farms burn in the background. Boer kommandos sniping at a British column on the veldt. \nPAN FROM the pictures TO photographs, sepia-toned, his- torical, and DR. DANIEL MARAIS and PK, strolling past the pictures. Marais points to a photo of a young Boer, turn of the century, posed stiffly with a rifle in the slouched hat of a Boer kommando. MARAIS Jan Piet Marais. My uncle. At 22 he led a kommando for three years before your people caught him and hung him. \nPK My people? \nMARAIS The English. \nPK I consider myself an African, sir. \nMARAIS As do I. As do the Zulu, the Xhosa, the Pongo, the Ndebele. We're all Africans. But all from separate tribes, ay? \nPK Unfortunately. \nMARAIS Why do you say that? PK Because it's the whole tribal idea that creates our problems here in South Africa. MARAIS The problems of South Africa, my boy, do not come from tribalism. They come from counter-tribalism. From people insisting that natural laws which have been in place and operating since God's creation, should be tampered with. Does the gazelle sleep with the lion? Does the rhino graze with the mouse? The separation of things is not coincidental. Do you think a Zulu wants to see his culture, his sense of identity, replaced by someone else's anymore than I do? \nPK No, sir. But I don't think he wants being a Zulu to mean he is denied the same rights as everyone else has. \nMARAIS Which is why civilization is defined by the ability to live under the rule of law. Laws define rights. \nPK But do they define justice? MARAIS Ah. Justice. The banner behind which the English marched as they gobbled up a quarter of the world? Justice, my boy, is only relative to who's in charge. \nPK And how long they stay in charge is only relative to how well they dispense that justice... (beat) ... with all due respect. \nMarais fixes PK with a stare.   PK's eyes meet his evenly, unwavering. Maria enters. \nMARIA Papa, would you like coffee in the library or the parlor? \nMARAIS (pleasant) The library, mein leib. \nMaria smiles at PK and exits.   He leads PK towards the library. \nMARAIS I can't figure out if you're brave or foolish. PK Why is that, sir? \nMARAIS You come here to ask for permission to see my daughter. Correct? \nPK Yes, sir. MARAIS And knowing  who I am, what I stand for, do you  think this sort of discussion  is going to put that request in  a favorable light? \nPK I thought a man of your intellectual reputation wouldn't want his daughter seeing someone who didn't think. \nMARAIS Let me give you some advice then. You're right. I admire a keen mind.  But intellectual reputation or not, I am first a Marais, a member of the Volk. \nMARAIS (CONT'D) And if you're trying to impress a member of the Volk with your intellect, don't do it espousing liberal ideas picked up in an English private school. \nPK These ideas I picked up somewhere else. \nMarais opens the library door.

ROCK OUTCROPPING - DAY                                40 \nA brilliant African sun beats down on the veldt below. On the rock, a seven-year-old PK sits looking somewhat sadly over the landscape. A long shadow covers him. The CLICK of a CAMERA is heard. PK turns, shielding his eyes with his hand against the glare of the sun to a tall, white-haired figure, shirtless, in hiking boots and kneesocks, holding a box camera. \nDOC (FIGURE) Ja. Perfect.    You will excuse me, please. \nDOC, speaking in German-accented English, moves off from the sun's glare down to PK's level. On his back is a knapsack with a cactus sticking out of it. \nDOC This I do not normally without permission do, ja? But to catch the expression. After all, it is the expression that is important. Ja? Without the expression the human being is just a lump of meat. You have some problems, I think. I am Professor Karl von Vollensteen. \nDoc clicks his heels together and bows his head slightly. \nPK I'm P.K. \nHe holds out his hand.   Doc takes it. \nDOC Such a young person with such an \nold expression. I think we can be friends. Ja? \nEighteen-year-old PK narrates. \nPK (V.O.) That was how I met Doc, as he insisted I call him. A chance meeting between a directionless seven-year-old boy and an old German professor out collecting cacti on the African bush veldt. (pause) So began my education. \nDoc and PK walk the veldt across craggy mountain trails, down dry river beds, through the jungle, always collecting cacti and aloe samples, Doc always talking, always explaining. \nPK (V.O.) Doc believed the brain had two functions and that the South African public school system unfortunately dealt with only one. \n", "test1_true": "Doc and PK sit high up. PK watches the endless animal migration below while Doc points things out across the landscape. \nPK (V.O.) Doc knew everything. He had a love of learning. But his real passion was centered around two things -- music and cacti. CUT TO: \n41   EXT.

Until he was fifty, Doc had a successful career as a concert pianist all over Europe. On his fiftieth birthday he gave it all up and moved to South Africa. From that point on it was all cactus.

CACTUS GARDEN - DAY                                42 \nBehind Doc's simple, whitewashed cottage is a magnif- icent cactus and aloe garden filled with the samples Doc has collected for years. PK and Doc plant another specimen. Doc photographs it. PK records its genus in a notebook. \nPK (V.O.)

DOC If God would choose a plant to represent Him, I think He would choose of all plants the cactus. This one plant has all the blessings He tried but failed to give man. It is true. Look. The cactus is humble but not submissive. It grows where no other plant will grow. The sun bakes its back, the wind rips it from cliffs, or drowns it in the dry desert sand. Not a complaint. In good times or bad it will still flower. It protects itself from danger. \nDoc touches a cactus needle. \nDOC But it harms no other plant.   It \nhas patience and solitude and modesty. In Mexico there is a cactus that blooms once in a hundred years and then only at night. That is saintliness of the highest order I think. Ja? From cactus comes medicine to heal the wounds of men and little buttons if you eat one you can touch the face of God or stare into the mouth of hell. It is the plant of patience, solitude, love, and madness. Modesty, beauty. Toughness and gentleness. Of all the plants I think it is closest to God. Ja? \nPK (V.O.) Doc was a hard man to disagree with. So when he decided I must spend as much time with him to remedy the flaw in my educational environment I didn't argue. CUT TO: \n44   INT. GRANDFATHER'S PARLOR                                 44 \nShabbily-genteel, Doc sits in his Sunday best, a cup of tea on his lips, talking in earnest to PK's pipe- puffing, also shabbily-genteel grandfather as PK looks on. \nPK (V.O.) Appealing to my grandfather's stoic belief in the primacy of European culture in all its forms, Doc offered to instruct me in piano in return for my helping him locate and gather his precious cacti. \nCUT TO: \n45   INT. DOC'S COTTAGE                                        45 \nDoc and PK practice on a beautiful Steinway, so grandly out of place in Doc's simple abode. \nPK (V.O.)

Everything depends on everything else. From the smallest to the biggest. Always in life an idea starts small like a tree. \nDoc shows PK a small tree with an even smaller vine attached to it. DOC This tree can grow so high it can touch the face of the sky. But this little vine can choke it and keep it small. Most people are like these vines. Afraid of new ideas. Afraid to let things grow. \nDoc rips the vine away from the tree. DOC Always listen to yourself. Follow your own idea. If you are wrong, so what? You learn something. And with learning you grow stronger. And if you are right at the beginning? An even bigger bonus. \nCUT TO: \n47   EXT.

I roamed the kloofs and ridges, the dry riverbeds and jungle floors with Doc for over a year, learning more than I realize even today.

Barberton was a very proper English town with a proper square, a wide main street, and the colonials' overblown patriotism for a homeland most people had never seen, hanging in the air like fine dust. Not quite seen, but there nonetheless. CUT TO: \n49   INT. CONCERT HALL                                       49 PK plays \"God Save the King\" on the stage. The town's population stands -- the men, stoic; the women, dewey- eyed, at patriotic attention. Some people file out -- the men in officers' uniforms of the South African penal system and their wives -- Boers. They exit to the dagger stares and some undertoned hissing and booing from Her Majesty's loyal subjects. \nPK (V.O.) The only Afrikaaners to live in Barberton were sent there to work at the government prison, just outside town. Germany had covertly supported the Boers in their two unsuccessful wars against British rule, supplying food and medical supplies as well as ample stocks of ammunition. \nPK (V.O.)(CONT'D) Germany was an old friend, a trusted friend. And in a country where a handshake is a friendship and a friendship a bond for life, as the war in Europe grew fiercer tensions in Barberton heated up. Suspicion was afoot. Spies were everywhere. \nCUT TO: \n50   EXT. ROAD TO DOC'S COTTAGE - DAY                           50 \nDoc and PK walk toward the cottage.   Doc reads PK's report card. DOC Grammar: satisfactory. Science: satisfactory. Mathetmatics: satisfactory. He looks down at PK. \nDOC P.K., if there is one thing I know you to be that is a lot more than just satisfactory. Ja? \nPK But I don't want to be known as a brain. \nDOC Why not? \nPK Who do you think gets beaten up on all the time in school? DOC My boy, to be smart is not a sin. But to be smart and not use it, that is sin number one. And as for getting beat up on, use your brain to figure out how not to be. He hands PK the report card, his displeasure obvious. As they crest the hill the cottage comes INTO VIEW along with a parked Army car and two armed soldiers leaning against it. Seeing Doc and PK, the soldiers smarten up, raising their rifles and advancing. \nDoc's face grows pale, his lips tight.   PK pulls close to him for support. \n", "test1_id": 852, "test2_input": "PK Yes, sir. LEWIS This Bormann, he was real? PK Yes, sir. \nLEWIS Was justice ever served? \nPK Yes, sir.

Solly hits the brake hard, throwing everyone forward. \nSOLLY You said the end of the road. \nNGUNI Yes, yes.    Sorry. I drive. He opens Solly's door with some urgency.

The glow of smoldering cooking fires through open doorways offers minimal illumination to the squalid lives within. Maria peers out at a world she has never seen. As the car drives, women and children gather along the road peering in. Mothers point to PK, instructing their children. \nVOICES Onoshobishobi Ingelosi. \nNGUNI The people have come from everywhere to see you. \nMaria takes PK's hand, a little nervous.      PK smiles at her confidently. \nMORRIE Where are the men? \nNGUNI They are to be witness. \nThe muffled sounds of VOICES SINGING reaches them, grow- ing louder as they approach. Maria is tense. Nguni senses this. He turns to her. \nNGUNI No worry, miss. It is the sound of happiness. He stops the car at a door in a high wooden wall guarded by two big men. \nNGUNI We are here. \nEveryone gets out of the car and passes through the door which shuts behind them. \nCUT TO: \n102   INT.

They're going to fight anyway. \nNGUNI It is very important the people see everything is correct. \nThey come to    an arch which leads into a big empty room. In the center    of the room stands a scale and a dozen Africans, all    dressed in worn but neatly pressed suits. Mandoma, the    other man who attended PK's fight at school, clad only in    boxing gear, waits on PK. \n", "test2_true": "MANDOMA I see you, PK. \nPK I just want you to know you fight a man.

An old man, one of the dignitaries says something to Nguni. \nNGUNI Please. \nHe motions for PK to step on the scale. PK does. The weight is duly noted. Mandoma then does the same.

The only lights in the area directly over it. With the twelve witnesses in the lead, the party makes its way through a path in the crowd. An OLD WOMAN with a fly switch, not unlike Inkosikazi's, speaks from the ring. As PK passes the whispers start. \nWHISPERS Onoshobishobi. \nThe Woman in the ring begins to chant.   The crowd picks it up. \nCROWD Onoshobishopi Ingelosi. Shobi shobi Ingelosi. \nPK looks back at Maria who is a bit unnerved, as are Morrie and Solly. He looks across at Mandoma whose face is a mask looking straight ahead, betraying nothing. The two men climb into the ring and stand in their corners. The Old Woman shuffles over and peers into PK's face. She mutters something inaudible, then turns to the crowd. \nOLD WOMAN Onoshobishobi Ingelosi. \nThe crowd picks up the chant. She waves and the crowd goes silent. Somewhere in the darkness a single voice begins to sing \"Nkosi Sikelel I Afrika\" -- the African national anthem. \nThe crowd picks it up. PK looks down to the front row where Nguni sits courteously attending to Maria in a seat of honor among the twelve men in suits. \nThe African national anthem finishes. The BELL RINGS three times. The Old Woman is led from the ring. An Indian Referee in all white enters the ring and waves the two fighters forward. \nREFEREE You are listening to me please. When I am shouting break, you must break at once. When a knockdown is coming, it is for an eight count. No heads, no elbows. You fight clean or by golly I am giving you penalty points.

PK and Mandoma touch gloves and go to their respective corners. \nPK What do you see? \nSolly watches Mandoma dancing across the ring. \nSOLLY A very tough fight. \nThe BELL RINGS. \nSOLLY Watch the left hook. \nMandoma comes charging across the ring and begins to fire everything in his arsenal at PK, overwhelming him. PK cannot get away from him and takes a series of devastat- ing combinations which end in a left hook to PK's jaw. PK drops like lead. The Referee starts counting. PK shakes his head clear and rises at eight. The Referee checks his gloves. There is a cut under his right eye. REFEREE Continue. Again, Mandoma comes charging hard. PK defends himself as best he can, trying to counter. But Mandoma's offense won't allow it. He beats on PK until the round ends. PK sits down in his corner. Morrie works on his eye. PK God, he hits like a truck. \nSOLLY He's going for the quick knockout. He can't keep it up. Soon the truck runs out of gas. \nPK If he catches me again like that I'll run out of gas -- permanently. \nThe BELL SOUNDS. PK is hardly off his stool when Mandoma is on him, pummeling him. PK backpedals, bobs and weaves. Mandoma's punches come fast and furious, each one looking to end the fight. Mandoma gets PK against the ropes and bangs away. PK covers up. Mandoma punishes his arms and kidneys. PK swings back and es- capes. Mandoma pursues him. He catches PK with a body chop and then a chopping left. PK goes down again. The Referee starts to count. The crowd is completely silent. The BELL RINGS. PK returns to his corner, shaking his head, trying to clear it. He flops onto his stool. \nSOLLY He's had it.

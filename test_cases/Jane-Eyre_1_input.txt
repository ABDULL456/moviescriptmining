JANE May I assist you, Mrs Fairfax? 
We see Mrs Fairfax approach Jane in a rush of gratitude. 
INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR. 
Jane wears a housekeeper's apron over her dress. She enters Rochester's room with an armful of bed linen. It has been returned to its former glory. Adele is jumping up and down on the bed. Sophie is trying to coax her off it. Jane gives Sophie the sheets. 
Adele leaves the room with Jane and skids all the way down the newly polished gallery in her stockinged feet. Jane can't help smiling. 
INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE KITCHENS. 
Jane sets down several bottles of wine on the kitchen table in order to dust them. The kitchen is a hive of activity - except for one lone figure sitting quietly in a chair by the fire, smoking a pipe; Grace Poole. Leah and one of the hired under cooks are talking abut her. 
UNDER COOK She gets good wages, I'd guess? 
LEAH Wish I had as good; not one fifth what Mrs Poole receives. 
Jane affects not to listen, but is keenly interested. 
LEAH (CONT'D) And she's laying it all by. I shouldn't wonder if she's saved enough to keep her independent. 
UNDER COOK She's a good hand, I daresay. 
LEAH Not everyone could do it, that's for sure, not even for the money. 
UNDER COOK No wonder the master relies on HER - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 62. 
Leah notices Jane's curious glance. She nudges the under cook. Jane, picks up the bottles and carries them away. As she passes she hears: 
UNDER COOK (CONT'D) Doesn't she know? 
At that moment, Adele rushes in. 
ADELE They're here! They're here! 
Mrs Fairfax tries to get her apron off. She becomes flustered. Jane helps her. 
MRS FAIRFAX Thank you. 
Mrs Fairfax and Adele go. Jane looks out of the window. 
Her attention is focussed on two equestrians who lead the arriving party; Rochester and Blanche, the dark beauty at his side. She is laughing at something. The sun shines behind her. Jane is dazzled. She turns away. 
INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR. 
Jane comes up the back stairs and on to the gallery, just as the ladies start to issue from their rooms. She stands back in a dark corner. 
There is an approach of chatter; a subdued vivacity. A flurry of multicoloured silks, lace and velvets go by. They descend the staircase as noiselessly as a bright mist. 
Jane steps out. She walks right into the path of Blanche Ingram, who is dressed in white. They both startle. 
JANE Excuse me, miss. 
Blanche gives her a look of ice. Rochester is at the top of the stairs. 
ROCHESTER Good evening. 
They both turn. Rochester has seen Blanche, not Jane. He offers her his arm, his gaze full of admiration. Jane sinks back into the shadows. 
ROCHESTER (CONT'D) May I? 
Blanche lays her gloved hand on Rochester's arm, barely touching him. They glide away. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 63. 
INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE HALL. 
Adele and Jane sit on the stairs, listening to Blanche and Rochester sing. Their voices thrill. Jane is trying not to feel. But when Rochester hits an exceptionally beautiful note, she involuntarily closes her eyes. 
Adele leans into Jane. She is crying. 
JANE What is it, darling? 
ADELE She sing like Maman. 
Jane, full of compassion, takes Adele back to her room. 
INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE SCHOOLROOM. 
Mrs Fairfax enters in a great hurry. 
MRS FAIRFAX Tonight. He wants you both in the drawing room after dinner. 
Adele leaps up, delighted. Jane is crestfallen. 
JANE Not me, surely. 
MRS FAIRFAX It's his particular wish. 
JANE He was being polite. 
MRS FAIRFAX I'm instructed to tell you that if you resist, he'll come up and get you himself. You needn't stay long. Just let him see you and then slip away. Don't worry; no one'll look at you.

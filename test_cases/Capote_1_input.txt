TRUMAN I think so. You know they're scheduled for next month? 
SHAWN Hanging. Yes. I'll commit as many issues as it takes to publish. Three. As many as it takes. 
TRUMAN I'm flying to Kansas tomorrow. I'll get Perry to talk -- 
SHAWN Honestly, what's he got to lose? 
Truman smiles at the joke, then stops himself. 
TRUMAN It really is too awful. Institutionalized sadism. 
Shawn nods. 
SHAWN You'll be able to finish now. 
TRUMAN As strange as it may sound to you, I'm going to miss him. 
FADE OUT. 
Over black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then passing. 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY 
Truman, flushed, out of breath, stands outside Perry's cell. He's just arrived. He holds a FOLDED-UP NEWSPAPER. Perry sits at his table reading LEGAL DOCUMENTS. 
TRUMAN When did you hear? 
Perry looks up, mistaking Truman's state for shared enthusiasm. He smiles widely. 
PERRY Two days ago. 
The Guard opens the cell for Truman. Perry holds up one of the DOCUMENTS. 
PERRY It's what we've been waiting for. A stay of execution to make a federal appeal. 
Truman enters. Perry goes to him and hugs him tightly. 
PERRY All thanks to you. 
On Truman, shocked, being hugged. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER 
Truman sits on the bed, his coat still on, watching Perry -- hyped up, talking, walking around the cell. 
PERRY Kansas's had it in for me for ten years -- in prison the first time, at that trial, here. They can't corner me now. Not till the U.S. Government says so -- 
TRUMAN Perry, sit down. For a minute. (Perry sits) I need you to talk to me... 
PERRY We've got all the time in the world to talk. About everything. I've been thinking about Ricardo. You need to stop sending him those trashy books. I won't even mention the pornography. (getting up) I realize he might have trouble grasping the literature you gave me, but those books only exacerbate the problem -- only 'heighten' or 'intensify' it. Maybe we should start him on a program... 
TRUMAN Perry. 
PERRY Give him the simple novels first -- 
TRUMAN Perry. 
Perry stops. 
TRUMAN I know what exacerbate means. 
PERRY Okay. I thought in case... 
TRUMAN There is not a word, or a sentence, or a concept, that you can illuminate for me. There is one singular reason that I keep coming here -- 
PERRY Truman -- 
TRUMAN ...November 14th, 1959. Three years ago. Three years. That's all I want to hear from you. 
Pause. 
PERRY I've asked you not to -- 
TRUMAN (stands up) This is ridiculous. (to the Guard) I'm ready. (to Perry) I have a plane to catch. I found your sister in Tacoma. Maybe she'll talk to me about something useful.

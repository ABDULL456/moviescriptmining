KIRSTY ...  as often as you want.  There's not going to be any breakthrough.  You might think it's delusion, but it's not.  I saw them.  I looked into their eyes and they looked back at me.  Creatures from Hell. 
INT.   24-HOUR DINER   NIGHT 
A late-night coffee-shop in the early hours of the morning. Classic American Diner. 
VARIOUS ANGLES 
Empty booths. 
A quiet counter.  A COP perches on a stool drinking coffee. 
A TRUCKER in a booth by himself bites methodically on a donut, his eyes staring off into the vacancy of the night. 
In a corner booth, FOUR KIDS nurse cokes and smoke cigarettes. 
ANGLE ON TABLE 
A black coffee sits by an ash-tray holding a burning cigarette. 
REVEAL TERRI 
- sitting at the table staring at the coffee. 
She waits.  She takes a drag on the smoke.  She waits.  She sips her coffee.  She waits.  She looks up across the diner. 
TERRI'S POV 
The double doors of the diner's entrance. 
ANGLE ON TERRI 
She looks back down at her coffee. 
The sound of doors opening OFF.  Terri looks up again. 
ANGLE FROM DOORS - TERRI IN DISTANCE 
A WALKING POV as somebody approaches Terri, whose face breaks into a nervous, ambiguous smile of welcome. 
REVERSE ANGLE - TERRI'S POV 
- as JP walks confidently to her table, smiling. 
JP Hey, babe.  Thanks for coming. 
JP sits down opposite her.  He reaches over and pats her hand. 
INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT 
Joey enters the unlit main room.  She glances across at the sofa.  It's unoccupied.  Joey puts the light on. 
She grimaces at the chaos of the room - the piles of videos and books - and crosses the room to the bedroom door.  She opens the door and looks in. 
JOEY Terri, we can't bunk up every night! People will ... 
The bedroom is empty, nobody on the bed. 
JOEY (off) ... talk.  ... Terri? 
Joey leaves the door and walks back into the main room. 
She looks around and then walks over to the phone.  Something has caught her eye. 
ANGLE BY PHONE 
A hand-scrawled note by the phone reads ENJOY MONTEREY, YOU LIAR. 
JOEY registers the note. 
JOEY Oh shit. 
Joey shakes her head sadly.  What can she do?  It's the early hours of the morning.  She has no idea where Terri is.  She walks back to the bedroom and closes the door behind her. 
EXT.   DENSE JUNGLE   DAY     (JOEY'S DREAM)

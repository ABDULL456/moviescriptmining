An  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is in place. The rug is gone. 
The  Dude  looks  around.    The  bowling sounds  continue. The beeps continue. 
The phone starts to jangle. 
TRACK 
We  push  Brandt  down  the  familiar  marble  hallway. Again  there is a  distant  aria.    Brandt  throws  out a wrist to  look at  his watch. 
BRANDT They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw? 
DUDE Oh, nothin', you know. 
They have reached the little desk outside of the big Lebowski's office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key and takes out an attache case.  He hands this to the Dude along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case. 
BRANDT Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give. 
DUDE Uh-huh. 
BRANDT Her life is in your hands. 
DUDE Oh, man, don't say that.. 
BRANDT Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands. 
DUDE Shit. 
BRANDT Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done. 
DUDE'S CAR 
We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through the front windshield.  The headlights play over Walter standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK SECURITY.  Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look oddly like a commuter.  He also holds an irregular shape bundled in brown wrapping paper. 
The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door and hands in the briefcase. 
WALTER Take the ringer.  I'll drive. 
The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over. 
DUDE The what? 
WALTER The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet? 
The Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it as the car starts rolling. 
DUDE What the hell is this? 
WALTER My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites. 
DUDE Agh-- 
He closes the briefcase. 
DUDE Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies-- 
WALTER Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty. 
DUDE Walter--what the fuck are you thinking? 
WALTER Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand-- 
DUDE We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along-- 
WALTER My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong? 
DUDE Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter-- 
WALTER It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself-- 
DUDE ' Yeah, but-- 
The phone chirps.  Dude grabs it. 
DUDE Dude here. 
VOICE (German accent) Who is this? 
DUDE Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go? 
VOICE ...Us? DUDE 
Shit. . . Uh, yeah, you know, me and the driver.  I'm not handling the money and driving the car and talking on the phone all by my fucking-- 
VOICE Shut the fuck up. (Beat) Hello? 
DUDE Yeah?

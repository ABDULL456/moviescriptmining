DARRYL See ya. 
Darryl leaves.  We see his Corvette parked out front.  As he closes the front door, Thelma leans against it. 
THELMA He's gonna shit. 
Thelma laughs to herself.  She goes back into the kitchen and picks up the phone and dials it. 
INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING 
The pay phone on the wall RINGS.  ALBERT, a busboy in his 50's, answers. 
ALBERT Good morning.  Why, yes, she is.  Is this Thelma?  Oh, Thelma, when you gonna run away with me? 
Louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand. 
LOUISE (to Albert) Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me. (into phone) Hi.  What'd he say? 
THELMA (V.O.) What time are you gonna pick me up? 
LOUISE You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three. 
THELMA (V.O.) What kind of stuff do I bring? 
LOUISE I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything. 
THELMA (V.O.) Okay.  I will, too. 
LOUISE And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff. 
THELMA (V.O.) I don't know how to fish, Louise. 
LOUISE Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready. 
They both hang up. 
EXT.  RESTAURANT - DAY 
Louise pulls out in a green '66 T-Bird in mint condition. 
INT.  THELMA'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY 
Going into the suitcase is bathing suits, wool socks, flannel pajamas, jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, a couple of dresses, way too much stuff for a two-day trip.  REVEAL Thelma, standing in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring, as if she's forgotten something.  The room looks like it was decorated entirely from a Sears catalog.  It's really frilly. 
INT.  LOUISE'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY 
A perfectly ordered suitcase, everything neatly folded and orderly.  Three pairs of underwear, one pair of long underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, one nightgown.  She could be packing for camp. 
REVEAL Louise.  Her room is as orderly as the suitcase. 
Everything matches.  It's not quite as frilly as Thelma's, but it is of the same ilk.  She is debating whether to take an extra pair of socks.  She decides not to and closes the suitcase.  She goes to the phone, picks it up and dials.  We hear: 
ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.) Hi.  This is Jimmy.  I'm not here right now, but I'll probably be back 'cause... all my stuff's here.  Leave a message. 
Louise slams down the phone.  A framed picture of Louise and Jimmy sits on the table next to the phone.  She matter-of- factly slams that face down, too. 
INT.  THELMA'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Thelma is still throwing stuff in, randomly now.  She talks to herself quietly the whole time. 
She is taking stuff off of her nightstand, a small clock, fingernail scissors, etc. 
She opens the drawer of her nightstand.  Her attitude is purposeful; she looks as if she knows exactly what she's doing; although, frankly, she has no idea, and each decision is completely arbitrary.  As she rifles through it, plucking various items from among the jumbled contents, we see there is a gun in there, one Darryl bought her for protection.  It is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets.  She picks up the gun like it's a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse. 
THELMA (muttering to herself) Psycho killers... 
She grabs the box of bullets and throws them in, too.  She tries to close her suitcase, but there is stuff hanging out all over the place.  She stuffs things back in the sides and heaves all her weight against the top. 
EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Louise's green '66 T-Bird convertible pulls into the driveway of Thelma's house.  The garage door goes up and Thelma is standing in the garage with all her gear.  A suitcase that looks like it might explode, fishing gear, a cooler, a lantern.  Thelma's car, a beat-up gray Honda, is parked in there, too.  Louise gets out of the driver's seat. 
LOUISE We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity. 
THELMA I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case. 
LOUISE In case of what? 
THELMA In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us. 
LOUISE (going along with her) Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs. 
THELMA We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway. 
They load everything into the car.  The trunk barely closes. Thelma heaves all her weight against it.  They get into the car and pull out of the driveway.  As they drive down the street, we hear Thelma let out a long howl. 
She is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the air. 
EXT.  CAR - DAY

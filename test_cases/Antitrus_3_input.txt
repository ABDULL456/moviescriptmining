Milo sits across from her. He doesn't know where to start. 
LISA What's wrong? 
He looks around, wants to make sure no one's listening. He speaks very quietly. 
MILO I snuck into #21. 
LISA Why would you do a thing like -- 
MILO You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care. 
LISA The Day Care? 
Two Men with even features enter the restaurant. One has a laptop case slung over his shoulder. 
MILO Can we go someplace else? 
EXT. CITY PARK - NIGHT 
They're in a bandshell. The rain falls heavily, drips off the eaves. She holds the filament from Teddy's workspace. 
MILO It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there. 
LISA But why would they --? 
MILO You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much. 
She's peering at him. He reads her mind. 
MILO I'm not one of them. Not trying to "suss you out." 
She wants to believe him. 
MILO They killed my best friend! I'm living with somebody they pay to go to bed with me. Can't you trust somebody just once? I don't wanna be alone here. 
His plea is so ardent, his humanity so transparent. But she can't quite do it. 
LISA I'm sorry, Milo... I'm sorry. 
She smiles sadly as she backs away. 
MILO (forcefully) I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you. (quieter) I know what he did to you. 
LISA Oh yeah? 
She tries to sound tough; there are tears in her eyes. 
LISA So that's in my -- file? 
He wants to comfort her. He takes a step toward her. She shakes her head: no. 
LISA Is that my -- scenario? (when he hesitates) Tell me. 
MILO They'd frame him. 
LISA (horrified) He's out of prison? 
MILO (he nods) They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge." 
She draws her hands to her face as the facade cracks. She weeps silently. He moves to her, carefully, slowly, seeing her fear, her trauma. He touches her shoulders. She tenses, tries to back away. 
LISA No. 
But he holds on. 
MILO Nobody's gonna hurt you. 
Slowly, he wraps his arms around her. 
She remains tense for a moment, then yields, pressing her face into his shoulder. The rain drums on the bandshell. After a moment: 
LISA ...Milo? 
MILO Hmm? 
LISA I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean. 
MILO No, no. Never. 
She clings to him tightly, now, the wall of her mistrust breached after all the years of pain, secrecy, shame. 
A wide shot: they hold each other, alone in the storm. 
VOICE (PHIL) All his suspicions were allayed? 
INT. LIBRARY-LIKE OFFICE - DAY 
Alice nods. She sits in front of leather-bound books. 
VOICE You're sure. 
She's at Gary's house. On the hot seat. Phil and Randy watch her. Gary does, too, but deep in shadow, behind a desk, at a remove. Rain falls heavily on the Lake.

BLACK SCREEN. 
GORDON (V.O) Harvey Dent was needed. He was everything Gotham has been crying out for. He was...a hero. Not the hero we deserved - the hero we needed. Nothing less than a knight, shining... 
The sound of cracking. Splintering. A shape appears, in ice. The shape of a BAT. The ice disintegrates... 
EXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY 
Gordon stands before a massive picture of Harvey Dent. 
GORDON But I knew Harvey Dent. I was...his friend. And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did. Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his eulogy. I believed in Harvey Dent. And we FADE TO BLACK. 
CUT TO: 
Racing along a cratered dirt road, and we are - 
INT. LAND CRUISER JOSTLING OVER UNEVEN TERRAIN - DAY 
Three Hooded Men guarded by East European Militia. A third Militia drives. Next to him is a nervous, bespectacled man. 
EXT. AIRSTRIP, EASTERN EUROPE - DAY 
An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men, stands in front of a commuter plane. CIA Man watches the Land Cruiser pull up, hard. The Militia Men jump out of the vehicle. The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA Man. 
CIA MAN Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA. Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a briefcase. 
DRIVER He wasn't alone. CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr. Pavel. 
CIA MAN You don't get to bring friends. 
DR. PAVEL 
(SHAKEN) They are not my friends. 
DRIVER Don't worry, no charge for them. 
CIA MAN Why would I want them? 
DRIVER They were trying to grab your prize. (Smiles.) They work for the mercenary. The masked man. 
CIA MAN 
(EXCITED) Bane? The Driver nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men. 
CIA MAN Get 'em on board - I'll call it in. 
EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY 
The commuter plane struggles over snow-capped mountains. 
INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS 
The three Hooded Men kneel by the cargo door, handcuffed. CIA Man grabs Hooded Man 1. 
CIA MAN What are you doing in the middle of my operation? 
Hooded Man 1 says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun. The flight plan I just filed with the Agency lists me, my men, and Dr. Pavel here. But only one of you. CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man 1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind. 
CIA MAN 
FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON MY AIRCRAFT! (Cocks weapon.) 
SO...WHO PAID YOU TO GRAB DR. 
PAVEL?! 
Nothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the Special Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet. 
CIA MAN 
HE DIDN'T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO 
TRY NEXT?! 
The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door. 
CIA MAN 
TELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE 
WEAR THE MASK?! 
The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the man's hood - he cocks the gun...nothing. 
CIA MAN 
LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN! 
THIRD PRISONER (O.S.) Or he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of an aeroplane. 
CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door. 
CIA MAN Wiseguy, huh? At least you can talk. Who are you? 
THIRD PRISONER We are nothing. We are the dirt beneath your feet. And no one cared who I was until I put on the mask... 
CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane. 
BANE Who we are does not matter. What matters is our plan.

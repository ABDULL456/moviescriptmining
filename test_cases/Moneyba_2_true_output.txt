ART Hattie. Grab a bat. 
SCOTT HATTEBERG actually points to himself and mouths, Me? 
ART Let's go. 
SCOTT pulls a bat from the rack and heads to the on-deck circle. He only manages a warmup pitch or two before - 
A153 INT. WEIGHT ROOM A153 
Billy is watching on a muted television as he sees Dye fly out to right field. As Hatte approaches the plate, he kills the TV. 
153 OMITTED 153 
154 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - SAME TIME 154 
As ROY STEELE's booming voice echoes: 
VOICE OF GOD Pinch hitting for Eric Byrnes--Scott Hatteberg. 
Scott's wife, ELIZABETH, watches from the VIP seats. She clutches her face. SCOTT lets the first pitch go by. 
UMPIRE Ball! 
Art Howe looks like he can't stand it any longer. In the dugout, Koch looks like a psychopath ready to kill. SCOTT steps out of the box to catch his breath. He steps back in and stares at the exact spot in space he thinks the pitch will leave the pitcher's hand. 
The pitch. SCOTT swings. 
Crack! 55,000 erupt. The A's leap to the front of the dugout steps and watch. 
We see the ball ascending on a strong trajectory, but before we can know for sure where it's headed, TIME SLOWS 
TO A CRAWL- 
155 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - SAME TIME 155 
BILLY's sitting on the floor with his back against the wall, trying to breathe. He looks like he's in pain. He can't move. He hears the crowd ERUPT outside. His Blackberry buzzes: 
"hatte homered. a's 12, ryls 11" 
Billy flips on the TV. With sound off, he watches silent images of his team swarming the mound in (archival footage) mixed in with Art Howe celebrating with them. 
156 OMITTED 156 
157 OMITTED 157 
158 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - SAME TIME 158 
The place is going crazy. ELIZABETH is screaming as she watches her husband get mauled by his teammates at the plate. 
159 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 159 
BILLY's still contemplating making AL history as celebrating players flood into the locker room just outside. Billy looks through a portal on the door. He's trapped in here now. He crosses into the 
160 INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 160 
The place is packed with players, coaches and news crews. There's no champagne spraying but they feel like they won the World Series and in fact have done something much more rare. Billy is trying to make a fast unnoticed exit. After pushing through the crowd, he walks outside of the club house into the - 
A161 INT. CORRIDORS / FAMILY AREA - CONTINUOUS A161 
where the players' families and wives are waiting. Billy sees ELIZABETH HATTEBERG walking toward him-- 
ELIZABETH Mr. Beane? I'm Elizabeth Hatteberg. We met at my house last Christmas. 
BILLY Sure. 
ELIZABETH Thank you. 
BILLY Thank me? Thank you. Whatever you put in those Christmas cookies, keep-- ELIZABETH starts to cry-- 
BILLY Whoa. It's okay. 
ELIZABETH I'm sorry. 
BILLY It's alright. 
ELIZABETH You don't know what it's like to have everyone think you're a failure. 
BILLY doesn't say anything but of course he does. 
BILLY Well...You never thought that, and that's 
WHAT'S-- 
ELIZABETH (the worst possible 
SIN) I did. 
(BEAT) And he knows I did. 
BILLY takes this in a second... 
BILLY Yeah he does know you did. 
ELIZABETH He's talked to you? 
BILLY No. I just know. 
(BEAT) That's all over now. 
(MORE) 
BILLY (CONT'D) Your husband just took a Jason Grimsley two-seam fastball and parked it in the upper deck in left field for a pinch-hit walk-off home run in a record breaking game. Go tell him about it. ELIZABETH looks at him a moment...and then starts crying 
AGAIN-- 
BILLY No it's okay now, just go. 
ELIZABETH goes off to find her husband. BILLY sees PETER standing there. 
BILLY Gilligan. 
PETER Congratulations. 
CUT TO: 
161 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 161 
BILLY and TARA are eating. 
BILLY Aw, man. I spend the season trying to reduce it to numbers and we won on romance. Suddenly it's the Natural with Hatteberg. Scott Hatteberg. 
(TOASTS) To twenty. 
TARA To twenty. 
(THEN) You should've seen Elizabeth's face when it went right over. 
BILLY She showed up afterwards.

This touching address has brought a note of sadness to the gathering. Indeed, there are tears in Walter's and Arnold's eyes. 
EDDIE (handing Arnold two neatly wrapped packages) Well, anyway, in all seriousness, here are a couple of presents from all of us in the office and good luck. 
Arnold takes the presents, stands, head bowed. Eddie sits and all faces turn to Arnold. 
ARNOLD Well, I just want to thank you fellows. I don't know what to say. I just want to thank you. 
KENNETH Open the presents, Arnold. 
ARNOLD I will. I just want to say, Eddie, that when the Pirates invade Ebbets Field next Tuesday night, I'm going to be sitting right there in Section 37 there right with you. 
EDDIE You'll be on your honeymoon next Tuesday, Arnold. 
This interesting information gives Arnold pause. 
ARNOLD Gee, that's right. 
CHARLIE (smiling) Arnold, you're getting married Sunday, did you forget? 
WALTER Look at him blush. 
ARNOLD (frowning fuzzily) No, I didn't forget. It's just that ... Gee, that's right. Sunday. What's today, Thursday? 
KENNETH and EDDIE All day! 
ARNOLD Boy, it's here, isn't it? I guess I've been running around so much the last couple of weeks, I guess the wedding snuck up on me. 
KENNETH I think Arnold's having a little buck fever. Does anyone know what our waiter looks like? 
EDDIE (to Kenneth) You know who didn't want to chip in for Arnold's presents? ... 
CHARLIE Arnold'll be all right. Have a drink, Arnold. 
WALTER I had my basic training in Camp Croft, South Carolina, near Spartanburg. 
EDDIE I was at Maxwell Field, what a desert. 
CHARLIE Walter, what ever happened when you and that tech sergeant from the motor pool got loaded on vanilla extract? 
WALTER What tech sergeant? 
CHARLIE Walter, you're crocked. (to Arnold) Open up the presents -- see what you got. 
KENNETH Hey, are you our waiter? Bring us some ice. I got him -- I got our waiter! 
ARNOLD It was sure nice of you fellows. 
The voices have risen again into the jumbled high spirits that opened the scene. 
EDDIE Hey, man, we're having a ball!

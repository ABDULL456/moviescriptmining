He asks a prisoner in Zulu. 
PK Have you seen Geel Piet? 
The man shakes his head.     PK looks worried. 
DOC (reassuring) He will come. 
The Kommandant, all medals and polished leather, mounts the stage, signaling a beginning to the festivities. 
VON ZYL Where is Bormann? I need Bormann to translate to the prisoners. SMIT I don't know, Kommandant. DOC Is there a problem here, Kommandant? 
VON ZYL I want to address these filthy kaffirs but I don't have a translator. 
PK I'll translate. 
VON ZYL You can speak Zulu, PK? PK Yes, sir. 
VON ZYL All right.   Listen up. 
He addresses the prisoners. VON ZYL Tell them this concert is the gift to them from the professor who, even though he is in prison, is not a dirty criminal like them but a man of culture and learning. 
PK (subtitled) The Kommandant welcomes you and looks forward to the great singing. 
VON ZYL For such a man I am happy to do this. But one hair of trouble and it's finish. 
PK (subtitled) He hopes each tribe will sing its best and bring honor to its people. VON ZYL One wrong move and you get marched back to your cells and don't come out for a month. PK (subtitled) He says tonight let us be one people under the African sky. 
The prisoners break into spontaneous applause.   Von Zyl looks at PK, unsuspecting, pleased. VON ZYL You did a good job. 
PK Thank you, sir. 
VON ZYL Professor? 
He turns the stage over to the professor and takes his seat. The professor sits at his stool, poised. PK, in front of the singers, watches him for a cue. Doc drops his head. PK points to a group of singers. MUSIC and VOICE blend spontaneously. "The Concerto for the Great Southland" begins. 
Doc plays magnificently with great style. PK focuses on leading the singers. Each section, each tribe singing its own songs with its own distinct cultural imprints on rhythm, pace and tone. 
87   CLOSE UP ON PK                                              87 
leading the singers in and out of the MUSIC. 
88   FLASH TO TRUNCHEON                                          88 
being raised and lowered on a familiar back. 
89   BACK TO SCENE                                               89 PK is caught short by the flash.   He falters a bit, then regains his concentration. 
90   FLASH TO TRUNCHEON                                         90 
coming down on a familiar head -- Geel Peit's. 
91   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              91 
Instinctively the first four prisoners in each group, the leaders, stand and turn to face their people. They take up the lead. PK, distracted by his inner vision, runs off stage. Doc looks after him, worried, but keeps playing. 
CUT TO: 
92   INT. PRISON                                                92 
PK runs through the empty cell blocks looking for some- one. PK runs through the corridors. He runs through the kitchens, the empty dining area, the SOUND of the concert chasing after him. 
He runs through the recreation area and past the boxing room when he hears a THUD, and another. 
93   INT. BOXING ROOM                                           93 
He bolts into the room and hits the light switch. The light over the ring comes on, illuminating Bormann, truncheon raised over the lifeless, broken body of Geel Piet. 
PK No! 
Startled, Bormann jumps out of the ring and runs off. PK scrambles into the ring and cradles the lifeless, blood- ied head in his lap, and begins to sob. 
PAN DOWN along Geel Piet's arm to his bloodied hand, holding the snapshot of him and PK. The Concerto grows LOUDER around PK until it enfolds him in its melodies. The voices of Africa, the music of Europe, reaching for a musical and spiritual crescendo. 
PK (V.O.) Geel Piet died of massive internal hemorrhage, the result of Bormann's ramming a truncheon up into the little man's body until his entrails spilled out. When I reached him he was already dead. I sat there crying, stroking his head and crying with African 
voices rising to heaven above, even as her blood soaked the ground below. 
The MUSIC SWELLS until the voices meld as one. CUT TO: 
94   INT. EXAMINERS' ROOM                                       94 
The four examiners all sit enthralled by the story. When PK looks up, a tear runs down his cheek. Lewis, who is visibly moved, clears his throat. Another man blows his nose with a handkerchief, covering his emotions. 
LEWIS Thank you very much. You will be notified as to the University's decision by mail. 
PK rises and goes to exit. 
LEWIS Point of curiousity. 
PK turns. 
LEWIS Your headmaster told me your work is somewhat autobiographical.

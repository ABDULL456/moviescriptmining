SECOND FLOOR 
Bozo gets off the floor again. He may have filled his pants. 
BOZO Just a bat! I'm okay! Just a bat! 
OUTSIDE THE DOOR 
BARTENDER If he doesn't shut up... 
COACH He is human kabob. 
SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN 
The room is like a converted pantry. Boss Man lies on a cot, kissing Belle. A tiny wall fan spins providing ventilation. 
Belle pulls away and brushes back her long hair. 
BELLE Doesn't your foot hurt? 
BOSS MAN I can't feel a thing, Hon. 
BELLE (touching his crotch) How 'bout now? 
BOSS MAN You're a bad girl, aren't you. 
Belle, a bit high, sways and starts to remove her clothes. 
BELLE Um-hmmm. 
BOSS MAN The girl's got rhythm. 
She takes off her blouse and tosses it at him. She then lifts up her skirt and bends over, giggling. 
BOSS MAN There it is. 
BASEMENT 
Roadie emerges with two crates. He dumps them on the floor. 
ROADIE This is all junk. 
Beer Guy holds a rusted machete. 
BEER GUY This could come in handy. 
HEROINE Let's get everything upstairs. 
Heroine moves to the stairs, but stops. She grabs Tuffy by the arm and takes her aside. 
HEROINE I'm sorry. 
TUFFY Don't worry, I'm fine. Really. 
HEROINE I admire your strength. 
TUFFY Trust me, I plan on having a full breakdown when this is over, but for now, we all have to be strong, right? 
Heroine reaches into her shirt and pulls out an IDENTICAL LOCKET as Tuffy's. She opens it and displays a picture of a LITTLE GIRL. 
HEROINE This is my daughter, Charlie. She's all I'm after. 
TUFFY (fighting back tears) Oh... 
HEROINE And I'm gonna need your strength, every bit of it. 
TUFFY You have it. 
HEROINE Good. But still do me a favor. 
TUFFY Name it. 
HEROINE (with a wink) Don't tell anyone I have a soft side. 
TUFFY (tiny smile) Deal. 
SECOND FLOOR 
Bozo turns and points the gun around the room. He sees the CB. It is like an intercom with a cable running outside. He drops the shotgun and fidgets with the CB knobs. 
BOZO Hello? Anyone there? We need help out here at the United Nations Tavern. Send guns, tanks, and all that shit. 10-4. S.O.S.

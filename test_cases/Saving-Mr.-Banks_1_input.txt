INT. LIMO - MORNING 
Ralph looks at Pamela in his rear-view, she seems weak, the steely fight flown away on the East wind. Her arms wrapped around her chest, her face turned to the window. 
RALPH Ya alright Mrs? Pamela doesn't even hear him. 
INT. ALLORA SCHOOL - AFTERNOON 
Ginty stares out of the window, in a daydream, a paintbrush in her hand, dripping colour down her arm. She is nudged to the present by her teacher, MRS CORRY. 
MRS CORRY Helen Goff? Wake up dear. You want your banner to be ready for the fair don't you? Ginty turns back to her painting - her banner reads: 
ALLORA FAIR Around the words Ginty is painting a gorgeous carousel with stunning horses, one of which is white with roses on its bridal. 
INT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY 
Margaret, Biddy and Ginty walk into the fairground. Tents are erected, farmers show off their sheep, children clutch sticks of cotton candy and a carousel spins with one stunning white horse amongst the drearier others, roses upon its bridal. 
BIDDY Mrs Brill said Father's presenting the medals. 
MARGARET (a flutter of pride) He is indeed! On behalf of the bank. 
INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING 
Pamela stares out of the window, not really concentrating on what's going on in the room. 
DON Mrs Travers? Again, she doesn't hear. 
DON (CONT'D) Mrs Travers? Pamela looks at Don. 
DON (CONT'D) We were just saying that we'd like to play you the song in the bank. 
(BEAT) Would that be good? Pamela nods, noncommittal. 
DON (CONT'D) (as Dawes Snr) So you have tuppence? May I be permitted to see it? (changing voice to Michael 
BANKS) No, I want it to feed the birds! (back to Dawes Snr) Fiddlesticks boy! Feed the birds and what've you got? 
DON/DICK/BOB Fat birds! 
DICK (singing more sotto than 
USUAL) But! If you invest your tuppence wisely in the bank 
EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY 
DICK (V.O.) Safe and sound-- A small stage and dais stand central of the event over which a large sign reads: 
SPONSORED BY THE BELHATCHETT BANK OF AUSTRALIA 
DICK (V.O.) Soon that tuppence safely invested in the bank will compound-- The Allora townsfolk are out in force. Ginty walks with her family. Her father attempting to memorise speech notes as they pass through the crowds. 
DICK (V.O.) And you'll achieve that sense of 
CONQUEST-- Margaret nudges him as Randolph Belhatchett and his family walk past. 
TRAVERS (clears his throat) Mr Belhatchett. Randolph looks at Travers, then at Travers shaking hands, his family nod and move on. Margaret looks upset by this. 
DICK (V.O.) As your affluence expands-- Travers buys two immense sticks of fairy floss and hands them to Ginty and Biddy. 
MARGARET Travers, Biddy's stomach-- 
TRAVERS Oh, for Gods' sake, Meg, stop whinnying like an old nag will you? Margaret is aghast at being spoken to like that in public but she keep her mouth shut. Ginty notices Travers eyes stray towards the refreshments tent. 
GINTY 
(PANICKED) Father-- will you ride the carousel with me!? But the refreshment tent has Travers in its grip. 
TRAVERS Meet you there in a blink of an eye! 
INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY 
As before. 
DICK 
(SINGING) In the hands of the directors who invest as propriety demands. 
EXT. FAIRGROUND - ALLORA - DAY

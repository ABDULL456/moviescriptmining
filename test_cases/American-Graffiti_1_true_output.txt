STEVE You wanna end up like John? You can't stay seventeen forever. 
CURT I just want some time to think. What's the rush? I'll go next year. 
STEVE We'll talk later. 
Steve walks off toward Laurie's Edsel. Laurie gets out. She's wearing a letterman's sweater with a large "Class of '62" emblazoned on the shoulder. Steve goes to her and they hug. 
On the radio, the music ends, and the Wolfman's intro tune comes on. 
RADIO (singing) "Here comes the Wolfman--Wolfman Jack!" 
WOLFMAN (V.O.) Oh, We're gonna rock and roll ourselves to death baby. You got the Wolfman Jack Show! 
MEL'S DRIVE-IN--NIGHT 
As the radio blares "Sixteen Candles," we see that with the darkness Burger City has come alive. A continual line of hot rods pulls into the parking lot to check out the parked cars, then returns to the maindrag. Carhops glide by on roller skates. Curt and John are fooling around in front of the deuce coupe. A horn honks and they turn as a '60 Ford with three girls in it slows by them. A girl leans out the window and smiles. 
GIRL Hi John! 
The girls in the car all screech and giggle as they zoom off. 
JOHN Not too good, huh? 
CURT Why is it every girl that comes around here is ugly? Or has a boyfriend? Where is the dazzling beauty I've been searching for all my life? 
John watches the procession of gleaming cars traveling through the hot night. 
JOHN I know what you mean. The pickin's are really gettin' slim. The whole strip is shrinking. Ah, you know, I remember about five years ago, take you a couple of hours and a tank full of gas just to make one circuit. It was really somethin.' 
Suddenly, in the distance, there's a blood-curdling scream from an incredible high-performance engine. The entire drive- in stops and listens. 
CURT Hey, John. Someone new in town. 
JOHN Ahhh. 
CURT You gonna go after him? 
JOHN Hey, listen, Professor, if he can't find me, then he ain't worth racin', right? 
CURT The big shot! 
Across the swarming parking lot, Steve sits in the front seat of his chevy with Laurie. Budda Macrae, a car hop, leans down to attach a tray to Steve's window, showing off her tight blouse. 
BUDDA A cherry-vanilla coke and a chocolate mountain. Anything else you want, Steve? (Steve shakes his head.) If there is you let me know now. Just honk and I'm yours. 
She tucks in her blouse a little tighter, gives him a hot look and goes to get the other tray. Budda takes the other tray around the car, almost shoves it in the window where Laurie is sitting. 
BUDDA One fries--grab it before I drop it. 
She gives Laurie an antagonistic look and goes off. Steve laughs. Laurie smiles. She's seventeen, very pretty, with big doe-eyes, and a short bobbed hairdo. She pushes up the sleeves on Steve's letterman sweater, which is sizes too large for her. His class ring glints on a chain around her neck. Laurie is sweet, the image of vulnerability, but with a practical and self-preserving mind beneath. 
STEVE Where was I? 
LAURIE Um, how you thought high school romances were goofy and we started going together just because you thought I was kinda cute and funny, but then you suddenly realized you were in love with me, it was serious... and ah... oh, you were leadin' up to somethin' kinda big. 
STEVE You make it sound like I'm giving dictation. Well, seriously, what I meant was, that ah... since we do care for each other so much, and since we should really consider ourselves as adults. Now, I, ah... could I have a couple of those fries? 
Through the windshield of the Chevy, they see Terry run by in front of them, chasing Budda Macrae who's outdistancing him on her roller skates. 
TERRY: Come on, Budda. Come on... 
Steve watches them go by, then looks back at Laurie. 
STEVE Ah, where was I? 
LAURIE ..."consider ourselves adults"... 
Laurie pretends to be interested in her french fries, but is obviously expecting something big. 
STEVE Right... right... anyway, I thought maybe, before I leave, we could ah... agree that... that seeing other people while I'm away can't possibly hurt, you know? 
Laurie hasn't looked up but her mood has changed like a mask. 
LAURIE You mean dating other people? 
STEVE I think it would strengthen our relationship. Then we'd know for sure that we're really in love. Not that there's any doubt. 
Steve smiles and then looks to her. He stops smiling. They listen to the radio for an awkward moment. Laurie struggles to hold back her tears. With obvious difficulty, she turns to him and smiles. He's expected something different and doesn't know what to do, so he smiles back. 
LAURIE I think you're right. I mean, we're not kids anymore, and it's silly to think that when we're three thousand miles apart we shouldn't be able to see other people and go out.

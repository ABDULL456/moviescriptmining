{"train": "\"SIGNS\" \nSIGNS \nby \nM. Night Shyamalan \nFADE IN: \nINT.  WINDOW - MORNING \nWe are looking out a second story window of a house.  The backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym, worn from use.  A single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a picnic table. \nThe backyard is lined by crops.  Corn.  Golden and brown. Six feet high. \nEverything is perfect.  Like a postcard.  And then we HEAR A CHILD SCREAM.  IT'S FAR AWAY.  WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING FROM. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BEDROOM - MORNING \nGRAHAM HESS wakes up from his sleep.  He thought he heard something.  He listens.  HE HEARS THE HEATER.  THE REFRIGERATOR DOWNSTAIRS HUMMING.  THE OCCASIONAL BIRDS OUTSIDE CHIRPING. \nGraham climbs out of bed.  He moves in his pajama pants and white Barron's minor league baseball T-shirt towards the bedroom door. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HALL LANDING - MORNING \nGraham stands in the hall landing where three bedroom doors meet.  He moves to the door that has children's drawings taped to it.  He puts his ear close.  Listens.  Beat. \nHe relaxes.  Graham leans down and picks up two balled up sweat socks and a child's sweater from the hallway floor.  He puts it in the hallway hamper before heading back into his bedroom. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BATHROOM - MORNING \nA bathroom door is open.  WE HEAR THE SINK RUNNING.  WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF TEETH BEING BRUSHED. \nOutside the bathroom on the bedroom wall is the sun faded outline of where a large CATHOLIC CROSS used to hang.  It's ghostly stained forever on the blank wall. \nA CHILD SCREAMS FROM FAR AWAY. \nThe water from the sink stops.  Graham steps into the doorway.  Toothbrush and foam in his mouth.  He becomes very still. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nThe bedroom door bursts open.  Graham steps into his children's room.  There are children's books everywhere. Overflowing off shelves.  Piled in corners. \nGraham's eyes move to the small messy beds.  They're both empty. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  GARAGE BEDROOM - MORNING \nWE HEAR THE VOICES OF TWO CHILDREN NOW.  THEIR SCREAMS FLOAT INTO A DARKENED BEDROOM OVER THE GARAGE. \nMERRILL HESS throws the bed sheets off himself as he swings onto his feet in one quick motion.  He is hyper-awake. Merrill is in his late twenties.  He is well build.  His muscles are tense as he stands in his red bikini briefs and looks around bewildered. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING \nGraham bangs open the back screen door and runs into the backyard.  He spins as he looks around. \nMerrill, now with a T-shirt and jeans, rumbles down the side stairs adjacent to the garage building. \nMerrill and Graham make eye contact as they approach each other across the yard. \nMERRILL Where are they? \nGraham looks around -- panic growing in his eyes. \nCHILDREN (yelling in the distance) Daaaad! \nGraham and Merrill in unison turn in the direction of the YELLING.  They look away from the house, across the yard and into THE THICK WALL OF CROPS. \nCUT TO: \nGraham steps through the back screen door into his \nKITCHEN. \nGraham holds the phone a little closer and talks in a HUSHED VOICE. \nGRAHAM (into phone) Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it was him.  You could just talk to him and that would be enough for me... See it was kind of strange finding the crops like that.  The kids were... confused by it.  It would take the strangeness away if we knew it was Lionel and the Wolfington brothers just messing around... (beat, listens) The movies... (beat) Are you sure? (beat) Okay, then... Thank you for your patience Lee. \nGraham turns off the phone.  He turns to put it on the counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen floor with one of their two German Shepherds.  There is a LARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles. \nMORGAN Houdini peed.  I think he's sick. \nGraham looks at the majestic dog.  It's shivering. \nGRAHAM Take him outside.  I'll call Dr. Reynolds. \nMorgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on their faces. \nGraham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the puddle of urine.  The DOORBELL rings with Graham still on his knees on the kitchen floor.  He leans back so he can see down the hall. \nA balding police officer stands on the other side of the screen door. \nGRAHAM That was quick Edgar.  I only called you boys about two hours ago. \nOFFICER EDGAR PASKI nods that he knows. \nOFFICER PASKI Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as she put it, \"diving for her life\" when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards. She went down to Thorton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.  Spitting! By the time I got there, Mrs. Kindleman had sprayed the whole damn place... She must have had a cold or something.  It was enough to turn a grown man's stomach. \nBeat.  Graham stares at Officer Paski. \nOFFICER PASKI So what happened to your crops? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BACKYARD JUNGLE GYM - LUNCHTIME \nBo walks from the house with a large glass of water.  She moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table. \nMorgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the grill.  He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers, before walking over to Houdini. \nThe two children sit down in the grass with the dog. \nBo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl. She stops.  Takes a tiny sip of the water first. \nShe holds the glass out to Morgan. \nBO I think it's contaminated. \nMORGAN You don't even know what that word means. \nHe drinks. \nMORGAN It's not contaminated.  It's just tap water.  Pour it in his bowl. \nBO It tastes funny. \nMORGAN He licks his butt everyday.  He's not going to mind. \nBo shrugs and pours it into the bowl.  Beat. \nHoudini just sits staring at them.  He is not shivering.  He doesn't drink.  He is unnaturally still. \nBo pushes the bowl closer. \nHOUDINI MOVES... \nBO'S HAND PULLS BACK... \nHOUDINI'S JAWS SNAP SHUT IN THE AIR WHERE HER HAND USED TO BE.  HE WAS JUST A FRACTION OF A SECOND LATER... \nBEAT.  The children turn white. \nMORGAN Houdini? \nHOUDINI BEGINS TO GROWL.  Bo stands up. \nMORGAN Bo don't run. \nHoudini crouches down. \nMORGAN What's wrong boy? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME \nMorgan watches the thin line of smoke rising from the charred patties on the grill next to the overturned picnic table. \nMorgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and Officer Paski enter the backyard.  They stop cold when they look in his direction.  They begin a slow walk towards him. \nMorgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on his lap.  Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently.  Bo is on top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball. \nAs Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is crying. \nThen they see the dog is laying on it side and has a BARBECUE FORK DEEP IN ITS NECK. \nBeat. \nThey stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his pocket and brings it to his mouth.  He inhales the asthma spray.  Beat.  He lowers the inhaler so he can speak. \nMORGAN (soft) He wanted to kill Bo. \nBeat.  Graham stares at his ten-year old son. \nGRAHAM Did he hurt you? \nBeat.  Morgan nods, \"No.\"  His tough exterior breaks as his face starts to tremble.  He starts crying.  Graham picks him up in his arms. \nGRAHAM (whispers in his ear) I'm so sorry Morgan. \nGraham reaches up for Bo.  She has dirt and tears on her face.  Beat.  She slowly climbs down.  Graham carries both his children as they cry in his arms. \nHe starts towards the house.  Merrill walks out from the back holding a bowl of food. \nMERRILL I used a little Tabasco in the potato salad. \nMerrill sees Houdini lying under the jungle gym. \nBO Houdini's sick. \nGRAHAM Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed.  Make sure the knot's tight. \nMerrill stands still with potato salad in his hands.  He nods. \nThe children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the shed. \nGraham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen door. \nThe last thing the children see as they enter the house, is the image of Officer Paski pulling the barbecue fork out of their dead dog's neck. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BEDROOM - LATE EVENING \nGraham lies in bed.  He rests his cheek against the pillow as he lies by himself. \nGRAHAM They're tough cookies, those two. They think Houdini's playing with you up there. (beat) At least it got them to sleep. \nGraham stares off.  Beat.  He smiles a little. \nGRAHAM Okay Miss Puzzle Master.  I got one for you... What can make geometric shapes the size of a football field... and what would scare every animal in this county? (beat) Have you figured it out yet? (smiles) You probably have... (beat) Give me a hint Colleen... Is it bigger than a bread box? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe large Hess farm house sits in the moonlight. \nA MILLION CRICKETS AND BUGS FILL THE NIGHT AIR WITH SOUND. \nTHEY SUDDENLY STOP. \nAN UNNATURAL SILENCE FILLS THE YARD. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGraham opens his eyes slowly as he stirs from his sleep.  His daughter Bo stares at him from the edge of the bed.  She is five inches away from his face. \nGraham gets startled. \nGRAHAM What's the matter? \nGRAHAM (whispering) It doesn't sound natural when I curse. \nMERRILL (whispering) Just make noises then. \nGRAHAM (whispering) Explain noises. \nMERRILL (whispering) Are you going to do this or what? \nGRAHAM (whispering) No I'm not. \nMERRILL (whispering) You want him coming in the house next time? \nBeat. \nThey HEAR MOVEMENT OUTSIDE.  Merrill and Graham look out into the darkness. \nMERRILL (hushed tone) On the count of three. (beat) One... two... three. \nMerrill and Graham go out the front door in opposite directions. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  MERRILL'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT \nMerrill is in a full sprint.  He hugs the side of the building as he runs. \nMERRILL We're gonna beat your ass bitch! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  GRAHAM'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT \nGraham runs through the darkness around the first corner of the house.  He waves his arms. \nGRAHAM Ahhhh... I'm insane with anger. \nGraham spots a LARGE FIGURE darting around the corner ahead of him. \nGRAHAM I've lost my mind!  It's time for an ass whoopin'! \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  MERRILL'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT \nMerrill turns a corner full speed.  THE LARGE FIGURE HAS COME TO A STOP IN THE SHADOWS AHEAD OF HIM.  HE SEEMS TO BLEND INTO THE DARKNESS WHEN HE'S STILL. \nMERRILL I'm gonna tear your head off! \nMerrill charges.  WE JUST MAKE OUT MOVEMENT IN THE DARKNESS AS THE FIGURE DISAPPEARS AROUND THE CORNER. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT \nGraham and Merrill come screaming around two corners and come to a stop facing each other.  Beat. \nThey look around, panting heavily. \nGRAHAM I cursed. \nMERRILL I heard. \nGraham's eyes drift above them. \nGRAHAM He's on the roof. \nThey follow the roof around the corner.  They find themselves in the backyard. \nTheir eyes catch movement away from the house.  They just catch A GLIMPSE OF THE LARGE FIGURE as he disappears into the crops.  The swing on the swing set is still moving from being hit. \nThey stare across the yard silently.  ALL WE HEAR IS THEIR HEAVY BREATHING. \nMERRILL (V.O.) It was very dark. \nGRAHAM (V.O.) Yes it was. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  PORCH - DAY \nOfficer Edgar Paski stands on the porch with his note pad open.  He faces Graham and Merrill. \nGRAHAM Six months. \nEdgar stares at Graham. \nGRAHAM And three weeks. \nOFFICER PASKI It's left its mark still.  The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.  Take them into town.  Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things.  It's good medicine. \nGRAHAM It's good advice... (beat) Say hi to Marcia for me. \nOFFICER PASKI You take care of yourself... (beat) Graham. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON \nWE MOVE THROUGH BACK ROADS OF BUCKS COUNTY.  RURAL PENNSYLVANIA IN ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL.  TREE LINED STREETS. WHITE PICKET FENCES.  APPLE ORCHARDS. \nThe Hess family rides in their station wagon.  Graham drives. Merrill is shotgun.  The children are in the back. \nMorgan leans forward and TURNS ON THE RADIO. \nRADIO VOICE ... signs intended to be seen from the sky -- \nCLICK.  Graham TURNS IT OFF. \nGRAHAM No radio either... Just for a while. \nMorgan nods and then plops back into the backseat. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON \nDowntown Bucks County.  A group of small stores along a quiet street. \nThe Hess station wagon pulls in front of a free parking meter. \nGraham steps out the driver's side and looks around.  Merrill puts change in the meter. \nMorgan walks up to Graham with Bo. \nMORGAN Book money. \nMorgan holds out his hand.  Graham gives his son a look as he reaches into his back pocket. \nGRAHAM Only one. \nMorgan takes the money Graham gives him, then takes Bo's hand and walks down the sidewalk. \nGraham watches them turn into a store. \nMerrill steps onto the sidewalk.  Hands in his pockets as he walks away. \nGraham turns and calls after him. \nGRAHAM (calls out) Meet back in fifteen minutes. \nMerrill waves over his shoulder.  He keeps walking. \nGraham starts across the street to the pharmacy. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON \nA mom and pop bookstore.  Three isles wide.  MR. AND MRS. NATHAN, a couple in their early seventies, sit behind their counter and watch a black and white TV.  The PICTURE ON THE TELEVISION IS OF A WHEAT FIELD.  THREE ENORMOUS TRIANGLES SURROUND A CIRCLE. \nMorgan steps up to the counter. \nMORGAN Extraterrestrials? \nMR. NATHAN That's what they keep alluding to. It's just a bunch of crock. They're trying to sell sodas, plain and simple.  I've been watching these reports since morning.  I've seen twelve soda commercials so far.  Twelve! \nMORGAN Do you have book on extraterrestrials? \nMR. NATHAN Don't tell me you believe this horse manure? \nMorgan shrugs.  Mrs. Nathan pushes her husband aside. \nMRS. NATHAN As a matter of fact, I think we have one.  Came by mistake in a shipment.  Decided to keep it for city people. \nCREWCUT GUY You got two minor league home run records don't you? \nBeat. \nMERRILL Five.  The five longest. \nCREWCUT GUY Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A? \nYOUNG MAN (O.S.) Cause he also has the minor league strike out record. \nMerrill turns to the young man, about his age, who sits at the folding table. \nMERRILL Hello Lionel. \nLIONEL smirks. \nLIONEL He'd just swing as hard as he could every time.  It didn't matter what the coach said, didn't matter who was on base, he'd whip that bat through the air as hard as he could... Looked like a lumber jack chopping down a tree. (beat) Merrill here, struck out more times than any two players. \nBeat. \nCREWCUT GUY You really hold the strike out record? \nBeat.  Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket.  Looks like he's not going to say anything.  When he does, the words are soft and worn; they've been said a hundred times. \nMERRILL Felt wrong not to swing. \nBeat.  The crewcut guy shakes his head.  Merrill turns and starts walking. \nAs he passes Lionel, Merrill makes a small, quick move in Lionel's direction, like he might hit him.  Lionel flinches and covers his face. \nMerrill walks out the door of the army recruiting office. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PHARMACY - AFTERNOON \nPHARMACIST I cursed thirty-seven times last week... I said the f-word a couple times, but mostly \"shits\" and \"bastards.\" (beat) Is \"Douche bag\" a curse? \nGraham glances at the girl as she sits sideways to him at the counter. \nGRAHAM I suppose it's in its usage. \nPHARMACIST How about \"John you're a douche bag for kissing Barbara?\" \nGRAHAM That's a curse. \nPHARMACIST Then it's not thirty-seven.  It's seventy-one. \nGraham's eyes widen. \nPHARMACIST I stole a bottle of Ruby red lip stick from K-mart... I punched my brother in the back three times... \nGraham looks around the empty store for help. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON \nBo sits at a tiny reading table and drinks a glass of water. There is another glass, half-full, on her table.  Mrs. Nathan watches as the little girl takes careful sips. \nBeat.  Bo looks up with a grimace. \nBO It's contaminated. \nMRS. NATHAN YELLS TO MR. NATHAN AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE. \nMRS. NATHAN Carl, there's something wrong with our water! \nMorgan doesn't look up from the extraterrestrial book. \nMORGAN Your water is fine.  Bo has a thing about her drinking water.  She's had it her whole life.  Like a tick people have.  Except it's not a tick. \nMRS. NATHAN (fascinated) Is that right? \nBo shrugs.  She places the glass she sipped on the table with the other glass. \nMrs. Nathan stares at the four-year old. \nMR. NATHAN (O.S.) Thirteen! \nEveryone turns to the front of the store where Mr. Nathan points to the TV screen.  A Coke Cola commercial is on. \nGRAHAM It's broken Morgan.  It'll just keep doing this. (beat) Let's get out of the car okay? \nMORGAN We might lose the signal. \nGRAHAM We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this. \nMERRILL We'll look like mental patients. \nBeat.  Nobody gets out of the station wagon. \nGRAHAM I'm getting out now. \nMORGAN Don't do it. \nGraham pulls the handle.  His door opens.  He waits before getting out.  The other three station wagon doors open right after. \nOUTSIDE CAR \nGraham stands and closes his driver side door. \nTHE MONITOR CHANGES SOUNDS.  THE BEEPING DISAPPEARS.  THE STATIC BECOMES LOUDER, BECOMING A MOVING, SWIRLING SOUND TEXTURE. \nMORGAN Nobody move! \nEveryone becomes frozen, standing next to the station wagon. Three of the doors are open. \nIN THE TEXTURE OF SOUND, JUST FOR A MOMENT, WE HEAR SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE... \nMORGAN Voices.  Did you hear that? \nEveryone stares at the baby monitor in Graham's hand. \nMORGAN Not English though.  You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill? \nBO I heard them Morgan. \nGraham doesn't move his arm.  He keeps it out in the air where he had it as he closed his door.  Graham looks to Merrill over the roof of the station wagon. \nGRAHAM It's probably picking up another baby monitor. \nMERRILL That's right. \nTHE SWIRLING TEXTURE SOUND FLOATS THROUGH THE AIR ABOVE THE STATION WAGON. \nMERRILL Let me see it. \nBeat.  Graham moves.  He hands the monitor over the hood. Merrill reaches for it. \nTHE SWIRLING, MOVING TEXTURE BECOMES LOUD AND FILLED WITH UNINTELLIGIBLE NOISES. \nMORGAN Stop! \nGraham and Merrill freeze -- both touching the monitor over the roof of the station wagon. \nWE HEAR SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VOICE EMERGE AND THEN QUICKLY FADE AWAY. \nMORGAN It doesn't sound like words. \nMerrill concentrates on THE SWIRLING MOVING TEXTURE COMING FROM THE BABY MONITOR. \nGraham looks around at his rapt family. \nGRAHAM See this is why we're not watching those news reports.  People get obsessed. (beat) I'm letting go now. \nBO No dad! \nMORGAN Don't do it! \nMERRILL You'll lose the signal! \nGraham looks at Merrill, who's now one of them.  Beat. \nMorgan is the first one to move. \nMORGAN Don't let go. \nHe moves from the back passenger door to the back bumper where he begins to climb onto the station wagon. \nGRAHAM Morgan? \nMORGAN It gets clearer, the higher you hold it. \nGRAHAM I can see how people can get carried away with this type of thing. \nGraham reaches the barbecue area.  There's a flashlight on the picnic table.  Graham TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON.  A NARROW BEAM FALLS ON THE GRASS FIVE FEET AHEAD OF HIM. \nGraham starts toward the crops. \nGRAHAM It's a kind of faith.  It's an intoxicating thing to believe in something you can't see. \nTHE BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE WALL OF CORN CROPS LINING THE BACKYARD.  Graham steps right up to them.  He hesitates and then steps into the field of \nCORN CROPS. \nWe can't see two feet in any direction.  Six foot stalks of corn line Graham on all sides.  THE FLASHLIGHT THROWS A WAVERING BEAM ON THE CROPS AHEAD OF HIM. \nGRAHAM You were always good at that... \nTHE BEAM OF HIS FLASHLIGHT FINDS A NARROW PATH.  Graham starts following it.  His shoulders brush crops on either side. \nGRAHAM Believing in things you couldn't see. (beat) You would have been the first person on that station wagon wouldn't you?  You and Morgan would have been wrestling for that baby monitor. \nSOMETHING MOVES UP AHEAD. \nGraham stops.  HE SHINES HIS LIGHT DOWN THE PATH.  Nothing but crops disappearing into darkness. \nGRAHAM It'll be secretly kind of sad for everybody, when this turns out to be -- all just make believe. \nTHERE'S MOVEMENT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.  Graham spins and aims the FLASHLIGHT AT THE CROPS TO HIS RIGHT.  THE LIGHT ONLY PENETRATES A FEW FEET INTO THE CROPS. \nGRAHAM (yelling) You're wasting your time here!  I'm not going to report this or anything you do to me crops, to the news or TV or anybody!  You're not going to get famous! \nBeat.  There is no response.  GRAHAM CAN HEAR HIS OWN BREATHING... IT SOUNDS HEAVY, ECHOISH... LIKE THERE'S TWO OF HIM. \nBeat.  Graham holds his breath.  THE SOUND OF SOMEONE ELSE BREATHING CONTINUES BEHIND HIM. \nGraham turns and drops the FLASHLIGHT at the same time.  THE BEAM OF LIGHT TURNS OFF WHEN THE FLASHLIGHT HITS THE GROUND. \nGRAHAM IS IN DARKNESS NOW.  HE LOOKS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BREATHING.  BUT CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.  HIS OWN BREATHING IS FAST AND LOUD NOW. \nGraham kneels down and gropes in the darkness.  His hands search over the ground in all directions.  They finally touch the flashlight.  Graham quickly fumbles with it to find the \"on\" button.  He does. \nA BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOTS ACROSS THE GROUND.  SOMETHING POWDERY WHITE STANDS FIVE FEET AWAY. \nIt instantly moves into the darkness.  Graham tries to get up.  He stumbles backwards into the crops.  He's tangled in crops as he struggles to rise.  He gets up and starts running. \nLeaves and stalks slap him from all directions.  He panics. He doesn't know where he is.  THERE IS SOMETHING COMING BEHIND HIM. \nGraham makes a sudden right turn.  He puts his hands in front of him to protect his face and eyes.  He's running as fast as he can.  HE HEARS STALKS OF CORN BREAKING BEHIND HIM. \nAnother sudden turn, this time left.  Graham emerges into his \nBACKYARD. \nGraham keeps running across the yard.  ISABELLE BARKS FRANTICALLY. \nWhen Graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns. \nThere is no one behind him.  The wall of crops fifty feet away sway in the gentle night breeze. \nGraham gains control of his breathing.  He turns and walks to the screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KITCHEN - EVENING \nGraham steps into the kitchen.  His hair is messed.  His shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it.  He locks the back door. \nThe children don't notice his presence.  They're splashing each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes. \nGraham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room. He sees Merrill there. \nMerrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the WOODEN BASEBALL BAT mounted above the fireplace.  Merrill doesn't notice him either. \nGraham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes a seat.  His breathing is a slow controlled pant.  He runs one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and thinks.  His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows his mind.  Beat. \nMerrill is the first to notice him.  He moves from where the baseball bat is hung, into the kitchen.  As he passes the children at the sink, he turns off the faucet. \nThe children stop playing and look up to Merrill.  They follow his stare to the kitchen table. \nBeat.  Graham looks up at them. \nGRAHAM (soft) Okay. (beat) Let's turn on the TV. \nMERRILL (whispers) Do you think it's a possibility? \nGRAHAM (whispers) Yes. \nMERRILL (whispers) How can you say that? \nGRAHAM (whispers) That wasn't the answer you wanted? \nMERRILL (whispers) Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be?  Give me some comfort? \nBeat.  Graham thinks it over. \nGRAHAM (whispers) ... There are all different ways you can tell that there's someone really there watching out for us. You see signs.  Sometimes they're little ones.  You think of someone. The phone rings.  They're on the phone... Sometimes they're big, like fourteen lights hovering over Mexico City. (beat) Sure, there are a lot of people watching this who think this could be a bad thing.  But there are a lot of people watching this, who think it's a miracle.  A sign of God's existence.  It's all in how you look at things Merrill. (beat) What you have to decide is what kind of person you are?  Are you the type who believes in miracles and looks for signs or are you the kind who believes, things just happen by chance? \nBeat.  Merrill is deep in thought. \nMERRILL I was at this party once.  I'm on a couch with Sara Mckinney.  She was just sitting there, looking beautiful and staring at me.  I go to lean in and kiss her and I realize I have gum in my mouth.  I turn and take out the gum.  Stuff it in my paper cup next to the sofa and turn around.  Sara Mckinney throws up all over herself. (beat) I knew the second it happened.  It was a miracle.  I could have been kissing her when she threw up. That would have scarred me for life.  I may never have recovered. \nMerrill looks at the TV screen.  Beat. \nMERRILL I'm a miracle man.  Those lights are a miracle. \nGraham smiles. \nGRAHAM (whispers) There you go. \nBeat. \nMERRILL (whispers) So which type are you? \nBeat. \nGRAHAM (whispers) Do you feel comforted? \nMERRILL (whispers) Yes. \nGRAHAM (whispers) What does it matter then? \nThe two of them turn back to the silent screen of the television.  It's a long beat before Graham speaks. \nGRAHAM (whispers) Do you know what Colleen's last words were before they killed her? \nBeat.  Merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother. \nGRAHAM (whispers) She said, \"See\", and then her eyes glazed a bit and she said... \"Tell Merrill to swing away.\" \nMerrill's mouth opens a bit.  Graham turns and chuckles at his expression. \nGRAHAM (whispers) Do you know why she said that? \nMerrill nods, \"No.\" \nGRAHAM (whispers) Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games popped into her head. (beat) There is no one watching out for us Merrill.  We're all on our own. \nGraham turns back to the television.  Beat. \nTHE LIGHT OF THE TELEVISION FLICKERS ON THE FACES OF THE TWO BROTHERS AS THEY SIT WATCHING IN SILENCE. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY \nGraham's eyes open.  DAYLIGHT FILLS the family room.  He is alone on the couch.  Alone in the room. \nHe looks to the television.  It's not there. \nGraham moves to his feet and look around the room.  His eyes stop on an EXTENSION CORD that runs from a wall outlet in the family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door. \nGraham moves to the door.  WE HEAR MUFFLED TELEVISION VOICES. Graham opens the \nCLOSET. \nMerrill looks up.  He's seated on a kitchen chair with the television on a roll-away stand crammed in with him. \nMERRILL For the kids protection.  All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m.  I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right? \nGRAHAM What's furry, furry rabbit? \nMERRILL (points) That's a game isn't it? (beat) Anyway... (points at the TV) There's been some interesting developments. \nGRAHAM What time is it? \nMORGAN There are pictures. \nBeat.  Morgan opens the tome. \nMORGAN Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book -- \nGRAHAM Bimboo? \nMORGAN Dad. \nGRAHAM I just asked his name. \nMERRILL You had a tone. \nBeat.  Graham acknowledges with a nod that he did have a tone. \nMORGAN He says there are two reasons why Extraterrestrials would visit us. \nMorgan turns the page. \nMORGAN To make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe. \nGraham looks at an illustration of a small, bulbous headed figure shaking hands with a bearded human. \nMORGAN Or the other reason... They're hostile.  They've used up the resources on their planet and are looking to harvest our planet next. \nMorgan turns the page.  There is a picture of a house.  A space ship is hovering over the home shooting laser beams at it.  Beat. \nGRAHAM Looks a little like our house doesn't it? \nMorgan and Bo lean in closer to look at the picture.  Beat. \nBO The same windows. \nMORGAN (soft) That's weird. \nThe three of them study the picture of the house.  It's on fire.  Their eyes move to the front yard.  There are three bodies lying dead on the front lawn.  Two are children. \nTHE PHONE RINGS. \nThe children SCREAM and cling to their father.  THEIR SCREAMS DIE DOWN.  The PHONE RINGS again.  Graham gets up.  He closes the book. \nGRAHAM That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for now.  Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something. \nGraham steps out into the hallway.  He tucks the book under his arm and picks up the phone. \nPHONE VOICE Father. \nTHROUGH THE PHONE WE HEAR SUDDEN SCUFFLING, A CHAIR SQUEAL AGAINST THE FLOOR and then the phone disconnects. \nGRAHAM Hello? \nNOTHING BUT DEAD AIR.  Graham looks at the receiver and then slowly hangs it up. \nGraham walks down the hall to a small window. \nThe window looks down the driveway and out onto the road. Graham stares into the distance.  About a half-mile away we see the TIP OF A HOUSE.  Graham gazes at it for a beat. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FRONT HALL - DAY \nGraham comes down the stairs with his overcoat on.  He moves to the closet door and knocks on it before opening it. \nMerrill looks up from the television. \nGRAHAM I'm going out for a few minutes. No one leaves this house.  No one. \nMerrill nods. \nMERRILL Where are you going? \nGRAHAM Ray Reddy's house. \nGraham starts down the hall.  Merrill steps out of the closet for the first time.  He looks down the hall shocked. \nMERRILL Why? \nGraham unlocks the front door. \nGRAHAM I think he just called here. \nRAY I worked so long that night.  I ain't never fallen asleep driving before.  And never since.  Most of the ride home, there wasn't a car insight in either direction.  If I'd fallen asleep then, I'd a ended up in a ditch with a head ache.  It had to happen at that right moment. That certain ten-fifteen seconds when I passed her walking.  It was like it was meant to be. \nRay finally turns.  His red face quivers as he talks. \nRAY I guess if this is the end of the world, I'm screwed right?  People who kill Reverends' wives aren't exactly ushered to the front of the line in heaven. \nRay starts the car. \nGRAHAM Where you going Ray? \nRAY To the lake.  The way I see it, all the places marked in the crops and such -- none of them are really near water.  I figure they don't like water. (beat) Can't be any worse than here. \nBeat. \nGRAHAM Ray, did you see one of them? \nRay looks at Graham. \nRAY I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and yours. \nThe two men stare at each other for a beat.  Ray looks away. He puts the car in drive. \nRAY And don't open my pantry Father.  I locked one of them in there. \nGraham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down the driveway. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLOSET - DAY \nMerrill's head is leaned against a bunch of winter coats. His eyes are closed. \nTV ANCHOR ... The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a forty-two year old Romero Valadares. \nMerrill's eyes open. \nTV ANCHOR This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's seventh birthday, in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.  It was sent to the local news bureau there and satellited to us a few minutes ago. All initial opinions are; this is genuine. \nTHE TELEVISION ANCHOR APPEARS FLUSTERED. \nTV ANCHOR What you are about to see, may disturb you. \nMerrill sits up in his chair. \nTHE PICTURE OF THE ANCHORMAN IS REPLACED BY A HANDHELD VIDEO IMAGE ON THE TV SCREEN.  THE IMAGE IS OF A FAMILY ROOM WHERE A BUNCH OF CHILDREN IN DRESS CLOTHES CROWD AROUND A SLIDING GLASS WINDOW. \nTHE CHILDREN ARE SPEAKING PORTUGUESE EXCITEDLY.  THEY LOOK AT THE CAMERA AND POINT TO THE OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS. \nTHE HANDHELD IMAGE MOVES OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO LOOK OUT THROUGH THE GLASS INTO A CRAMPED BACKYARD.  THERE IS A RECTANGULAR TABLE WITH PARTY DECORATIONS AND AN UNTOUCHED BIRTHDAY CAKE ON IT.  COLORFUL BALLOONS FLOAT AROUND THE BACKYARD.  THERE IS NO ONE OUTSIDE. \nTHE IMAGES PANS AROUND THE DENSE FOLIAGE THAT FORMS A WALL AROUND THE YARD.  THE IMAGE ZOOMS AND SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS OF THE BRANCHES. \nThe chair in the closet CREAKS as Merrill leans forward a little towards the television screen. \nWE HEAR A BURST OF PORTUGUESE.  THE IMAGE PANS AWAY FROM THE GLASS DOORS BACK INTO THE HOME.  WE LOOK DOWN A NARROW HALL TO THE KITCHEN.  A BOY WITH A BIRTHDAY HAT IS SEATED ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER, POINTING FRANTICALLY OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW. HE YELLS IN PORTUGUESE. \nTHE CROWD OF CHILDREN AROUND THE GLASS DOORS START RUSHING INTO THE KITCHEN.  THEY ARE JOINED BY A FEW ADULTS.  THE IMAGE FOLLOWS THEM IN. \nTHE KITCHEN WINDOW IS BLOCKED BY HEADS WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVE. \nMERRILL Move children!  Vamonos! \nTHE IMAGE FINDS AN OPENING OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE BOY WITH THE BIRTHDAY HAT AND ANOTHER CHILD. \nWE ARE NOW LOOKING OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW.  WE SEE A NARROW ALLEY ONLY A FEW FEET WIDE CREATED BY A STONE WALL AND A SMALL GARAGE BUILDING.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL IS DENSE FOLIAGE.  THE WALL ENDS A FEW FEET AFTER THE GARAGE BUILDING. \nWE HEAR THE CHILD'S VOICE VERY CLOSE TO US SPEAKING IN PORTUGUESE.  THE CAMERA PANS JUST A LITTLE AS THE FACE OF THE LITTLE BIRTHDAY BOY FILLS THE SCREEN.  HE TALKS EXCITEDLY DIRECTLY AT US AND AT SOMEONE BEHIND THE IMAGE. \nBOY WITH HAT Esta atras da garagem!  Esta atras de ai!  Is behind! \nTHE BOY GESTURES TO THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE IMAGE SETTLES BACK ON THE WINDOW.  WE STARE AT THE NARROW ALLEY.  THE IMAGE ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE IMAGE STARTS WIDENING OUT. \nAND THEN WE SEE IT. \nTHE KITCHEN ERUPTS WITH CHILDREN'S SCREAMS AS A LARGE NON- HUMAN FIGURE MOVES FROM THE GARAGE BUILDING TO BEHIND THE WALL.  IT'S OUT OF SIGHT IN LESS THAN A SECOND. \nMerrill is frozen like a statue.  His mouth is open a little. The closet FILLS WITH THE PANDEMONIA OF THE KITCHEN ON THE VIDEO. \nTHE VIDEO IMAGE ON THE NEWS, PAUSES.  BEAT.  WE SEE IT REWIND.  WE SEE THE FIGURE ZIP BACK BEHIND THE GARAGE IN A FLICKER.  THE VIDEO STOPS.  PLAYS AGAIN. \nTHE IMAGE ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE BUILDING.  STARTS TO WIDEN OUT.  THE KITCHEN STARTS TO FILL WITH SCREAMS AS THE FIGURE APPEARS... THE IMAGE FREEZES. \nTHE STATION WAGON SUDDENLY BRAKES. \nTwo black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon comes to a fast stop. \nBeat.  Graham gets out of the car.  He walks a few feet ahead of the station wagon.  He bends down in the middle of the road. \nA BIRD lays limp on the asphalt.  Its head is crushed. \nGraham gazes at the still pile of feathers.  Beat. \nGraham turns and looks straight up at the BLUE, CLOUDLESS SKY above him. \nGRAHAM (soft) Douche bag. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HESS FAMILY ROOM - DAY \nGraham enters his front hall.  He closes the door and locks it behind him.  He turns and looks into the family room. \nMorgan and Bo and Merrill are seated together on the sofa. All three are wearing foil helmets.  Beat. \nMERRILL They're skin changes color.  That's why we couldn't see him that night. \nGraham stares at his family huddled on the couch.  Beat. Graham takes in the news as he moves to the stairs.  He takes a seat on the second to last step. \nHe sits obscured by the balusters.  Beat. \nGRAHAM Tell me something Morgan.  In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile? \nMORGAN Yes.  They would invade us using only ground tactics.  Hand to hand combat.  They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them. \nMERRILL I'm sorry, what book is this? \nGRAHAM Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade? \nMORGAN They said one of two things could happen.  One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later. \nGRAHAM What's two? \nMORGAN They win. \nThe words hang in the air.  Graham sits quietly on the second step of the stairs. \nGRAHAM What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something? \nMORGAN Sounds made up. \nBeat. \nGRAHAM We can choose to believe it and pack up and leave. (beat) Or we can stay here.  Board up this house.  Hide inside our home and wait it out.  Either way, at least we'll be together. (beat) All those in favor of the lake, raise your hand. \nNo one raises their hand. \nGRAHAM All those in favor of home, raise your hand. \nAll four put their hands in the air.  Beat.  They lower them and sit in silence. \nMERRILL How do we know boards will do anything? \nBeat. \nGRAHAM (soft) Because, they seem to have trouble with pantry doors. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  HESS HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nWE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE FROM THE CROPS.  We see Graham inside the house, closing the window shutters in one room after another. \nWE SEE a stack of wooden boards on the porch. \nOUR VIEW MOVES to the barn where Isabelle is tied.  She is not pacing.  She is not barking.  She sits staring right at us.  She is shivering. \nOUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs. He's moving into the main house. \nMerrill walks across the yard.  His eyes look around carefully as he moves. \nPart of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses the lawn.  He stops walking and starts to gather up the fallen things.  He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs encased in glass cases. \nThe glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has cracked.  He takes the ball out.  Stares at it. \nMERRILL (whispers) You guys okay? \nThey don't answer.  They watch the soldiers loading up onto trucks on the television. \nMORGAN Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world. (beat) Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill? \nMERRILL Don't worry. \nMorgan glances at Bo and then back to his uncle. \nMORGAN You sure right? \nBeat.  Merrill gazes at the two questioning faces.  He looks back at the empty closet doorway where Graham stood.  He turns back to the children. \nMERRILL You know about signs Morgan?  Not like the ones people write on. It's like if you poured a glass of milk and you dropped the glass by mistake and broke it before you could drink it.  Then you looked at the milk carton and saw that the milk was spoiled.  They're things that happen by chance or luck, but make you feel that someone's watching out for you. \nThe children think it over.  Beat. \nMORGAN I once had a bad dream and I couldn't wake up.  I kicked at the table next to my bed and something fell on me and I woke up.  It was a picture of mom.  She was smiling. It made me feel safe... You mean like that? \nBeat. \nMERRILL Yeah, like that. (beat) I believe in signs Morgan.  I think there's someone watching out for us.  I got to believe he's going to make sure we're all right in the end. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON \nMerrill smiles as he steps out of the closet and closes the door half-way. \nHe stands in the hall by himself.  He takes a couple deep breaths as everything hits him. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLOSET - LATE AFTERNOON \nMorgan turns off the television. \nHe and Bo sit quietly in the closet under the stairs. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FAMILY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nGraham sits in a chair by the windows.  He has a board on his lap.  He has a hammer in his hands.  Graham drowns in his thoughts as the skies darken behind him. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING - EVENING \nGraham, Bo and Morgan are seated in the upstairs hallway. There's a couple boards left leaning against the walls. \nMerrill comes out of the children's room with his tools. \nMERRILL Too many windows in the bedrooms. We don't have enough boards. \nMerrill stands and leans against the wall. \nGRAHAM We'll have to board up the bedroom doors. \nMORGAN Where are we going to sleep? \nGRAHAM The family room. \nEveryone sits quietly for a moment. \nMORGAN What about Isabelle? \nGRAHAM We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner. \nBeat. \nMERRILL I'll make sandwiches. \nBO I want spaghetti? \nMERRILL We should eat fast Bo. \nGRAHAM Spaghetti sounds great. \nMerrill glances at Graham. \nGRAHAM (soft) It's happening. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING \nMerrill pounds furiously with his hammer as he nails boards to the children's bedroom door.  The master bedroom door is open with a board leaning next to it.  Graham is inside his bedroom \nCUT TO: \nINT.  GRAHAM'S BEDROOM - EVENING \nGraham walks to the window next to his bed.  It's the same one we've looked out twice before. \nGraham looks out onto his backyard.  The FLOOD LIGHT FROM THE HOUSE THROWS LONG SHADOWS OVER THE YARD.  There is a light breeze.  Nothing seems wrong. \nGraham's eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on into darkness.  He moves closer to the glass.  Watches the top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind. \nSOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS. \nGraham's eyes moves to where the corn crops fade into black forty feet away.  Graham goes very still. \nLINES EMERGE IN THE CROPS; THE KIND OF LINES MADE BY SOMEONE TRAMPLING THROUGH A FIELD.  WE CAN'T SEE WHO'S MAKING THEM. ALL WE SEE ARE THE COUNTLESS LINES BEING FORMED.  THE LINES MOVE FROM THE DARKNESS TOWARDS THE HOUSE.  GRAHAM WATCHES THEM CLOSE IN ON HIS BACKYARD.  THIRTY FEET... TWENTY FEET... TEN... \nGraham backs away from the window towards the middle of his bedroom. \nMERRILL Graham hurry. \nGraham turns to see Merrill standing with the last board in the hall.  Graham moves out into the hall and shuts the bedroom door behind him. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING \nMerrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts hammering nails into the frame.  Graham picks up his hammer and quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood. \nGraham glances to his right as he works.  Bo and Morgan are standing together at the top of the stairs.  Bo holds Morgan's hand. \nGraham keeps hammering as he speaks. \nGRAHAM Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo? \nBo nods \"no\" lightly. \nGRAHAM You came out of your momma and you didn't even cry.  You just opened your eyes and looked around at everybody.  Your eyes were so big and gorgeous, the ladies in the room gasped. \nGraham stops hammering.  Merrill keeps going. \nGRAHAM They literally gasped. (Graham gasps like them) Then they go, \"She's like an angel.\"  They said, \"We've never seen a baby so beautiful.\" \nGraham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment.  Merrill finishes hammering. \nGraham goes over and picks up Bo. \nGRAHAM (soft) And you know what else happened? \nBo nods, \"no.\" \nGRAHAM (soft) When they put you on the table to clean you up, you looked at me and smiled.  They say babies that young can't smile... You smiled. \nGraham looks at his daughter quietly.  He brushes the hair out of her face as Merrill moves to Morgan and picks him up. \nAll four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors. Beat. \nGRAHAM (soft) Let's go down now. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING \nGraham puts Bo down in the hallway.  She stands close to him. Merrill puts down Morgan.  The four of them stand quietly in a tight group. \nTHEY HEAR FRANTIC BARKING IN THE DISTANCE. \nMORGAN We forgot about Isabelle. \nISABELLE'S BARKING BECOMES DESPERATE AND ANGRY.  THEY LISTEN AS SHE BARKS NONSTOP FOR TEN SECONDS... AND THEN SUDDENLY STOPS. \nTHE LOW EMERGENCY TONE FROM THE CLOSET TV FILLS THE SILENCE. \nBeat. \nGraham goes to the closet and grabs the door.  He starts rocking it hard.  Pulling it out... It starts to come out of its guide rail... Graham leans back with all his weight... The thin wooden door rips out of place.  One end is still attached at the hinge.  Graham pulls it straight.  It reaches into the middle of the landing.  It stands right next to Merrill.  Right under the attic trapdoor.  Its top is only a few inches lower than Merrill's reach. \nGRAHAM Let go. \nMerrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor.  It connects with the top of the closet door and stops.  The trapdoor is now open almost a foot... We can now see part of the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to the attic. \nMerrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds the weight of the attic door. \nAfter a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as the pressure is let up.  The trapdoor closes.  Beat. \nIt opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet door with a THUD. \nThe attic trapdoor closes again.  Opens again with force. THUD. \nThe closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges keeping it upright. \nGraham moves down the stairs.  Merrill follows him. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING \nTHE SCRATCHING NOISES FILL THE HOUSE. \nMorgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach under the front door.  THE COLOR OF THE FINGERS CHANGES -- TO THE EXACT COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE YELLOW CRACKED PAINT ON THE DOOR. \nTHUD.  THE TRAPDOOR SLAMS THE TOP OF THE FOLDING DOOR UPSTAIRS. \nGraham and Merrill arrive in the front hall.  Graham takes Morgan and Bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the hall.  Merrill backs away as he watches the top of the stairs. \nANOTHER THUD ECHOES THROUGH THE HOUSE. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KITCHEN - EVENING \nThe swinging door swings open and closed behind Merrill as he enters the kitchen. \nGraham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and waits by it.  Merrill goes over and the two of them push the table against the swinging door. \nThey take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top, and jam the rest underneath the table. \nGraham leans against the kitchen counter.  Merrill stares at the pile of furniture. \nMERRILL This is going to do nothing. \nGRAHAM We have to go in the basement. \nGraham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a darkened door at the bottom. \nMERRILL There's no way out of there. \nBeat.  Graham looks at the faces of his frightened children. \nGRAHAM Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm? \nTHUD. \nMERRILL Should we make a run for it out the back? \nGRAHAM They're right behind the door. \nMerrill looks at the boarded up back door.  Graham turns to Bo and Morgan who stand against the wall. \nGRAHAM He was only a year and half old. \nMERRILL (to Graham) What are you doing? \nGRAHAM He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar.  Your grandma said, \"No.\"  He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it. \nTHUD WITH A CRACK OF WOOD FROM UPSTAIRS.  Merrill turns and stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen. \nGRAHAM I must have pulled his arm at an awkward angle.  His elbow popped right out of the socket. \nTHE LAST THUD COMES WITH A SOUND OF WOOD SPLINTERING.  THE CLOSET FOLDING DOOR CRASHES TO THE GROUND IN THE UPSTAIRS HALL. \nWE HEAR CREAKS AS THE ATTIC TRAPDOOR OPENS. \nGRAHAM He didn't scream or anything.  His arm just flopped to his side and he got real still. \nMERRILL They're coming. \nShe points at the closet. \nMorgan strains to look in her direction.  Graham looks at him. \nGRAHAM You want to see it? \nMorgan nods, \"yes\" as he struggles to breathe. \nGRAHAM I'll bring the TV in here. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CLOSET - MORNING \nTHE TELEVISION SHOWS A SHOT OF A STREET CORNER.  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STAND IN THE STREETS.  A REPORTER STANDS AMONGST THEM AND TALKS INTO A MICROPHONE. \nTV REPORTER Today there are no countries, and no races, and no differences -- we are all apart of the same -- \nGraham unplugs the television.  The screen goes black. \nBo moves the coats aside as Graham wheels the television and the television cart out into the hall. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING \nGraham pulls the television into the family room.  Careful not to trip it on the carpet. \nTHE GLASS OF THE TELEVISION IS LIKE A MIRROR. \nGraham moves the television into position.  THE BLACK SCREEN REFLECTS THE FAMILY ROOM BEHIND GRAHAM AS IT TURNS. \nTHE REFLECTION OF A CREATURE SILHOUETTED PANS ACROSS THE TELEVISION SCREEN. \nThe TV stops moving.  Graham stays frozen with his hands on either side of the television cart.  He's slightly bent over. His back is to the family room. \nGraham straightens and turns around slowly. \nMorgan is held by his waist three feet in the air.  Morgan's face turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up. \nFor a moment it appears he's suspended in the air.  Then we see the outlines... and we see the eyes.  The black eyes. \nThere is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the middle of the family room.  It's powdery skin has taken on the shades, lines and colors of the family room so perfectly, it almost disappears. \nIt blinks. \nGraham and Bo have turned to stone.  Bo stands frozen in the front hall. \nMerrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the family room.  He takes two steps into the room and comes to a stop next to the fireplace.  The inhaler and syringe in his hand fall to the ground.  The creature is between Graham and Merrill in the middle of the family room. \nMorgan is dying.  THE LAST SOUNDS OF AIR STOP IN HIS THROAT. \nThe lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the creature's skin move as the creature moves its free hand. \nGraham's eyes shift to the hand.  THREE OF THE CREATURES FINGERS ARE MISSING -- SLICED OFF BY A BUTCHER KNIFE. \nThe creature's hand moves to Morgan's face.  It tilts its fingers and palm back.  THE COLORS ON THE HAND ARE ALREADY CHANGING TO MATCH IT'S NEW POSITION IN THE ROOM. \nA small pore opens up on its wrist.  A YELLOWISH GAS STARTS TO LEAK OUT OF THE OPENING. \nGraham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of the creature.  It's large empty black eyes lock on Graham's. \nGRAHAM STARTS TO HEAR A HIGH PITCH RINGING SOUND -- IT BEGINS TO ENGULF ALL SOUND IN THE ROOM. \nGRAHAM STARES HELPLESSLY INTO THE LARGE BLACK EYES. \nWE MOVE INTO GRAHAM'S EYES... THEY WIDEN.  WE SEE THE EMOTION IN THEM.  HIS MOUTH BARELY GETS THE WORDS OUT. \nGRAHAM (soft) He's reading my -- \nTHE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUND OVERWHELMS EVERYTHING.  THE ROOM GOES BRIGHT WHITE. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  STREET - NIGHT \nWE ARE BLINDED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT.  THE LIGHT IS MOVING.  WE REALIZE IT IS THE HEADLIGHTS OF A CAR THAT PULLS TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. \nThe car door opens.  Graham Hess steps out.  His coat is open.  He is wearing a black shirt and black pants.  A priest's white collar sits under the lapel of the black shirt.  Graham looks around in a daze. \nWe are on a country road.  THERE ARE STROBING RED AND WHITE LIGHTS FILLING THE NIGHT AIR.  Four police cars are scattered amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances. \nGRAHAM Good. \nGraham touches her cheek.  She starts crying.  Graham starts crying with her. \nCOLLEEN (crying) ... Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly. \nGRAHAM (crying) ... I will. \nCOLLEEN (crying) ... Tell Bo to listen to her brother.  He'll always take care of her. \nGRAHAM (crying) ... I will. \nCOLLEEN (crying) ... Tell Graham -- \nGRAHAM (crying) I'm here. \nCOLLEEN (crying) Tell him... See.  Tell him to see. \nColleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand.  She rests on it.  Her eyes are distant. \nCOLLEEN (soft) And tell Merrill to swing away. \nGRAHAM (soft) What? (beat) Colleen?... Colleen? \nWE ARE OVERCOME BY A BRIGHT WHITE. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING \nWE ARE IN THE FAMILY ROOM.  THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUNDS FADE AND ARE REPLACED BY THE BREATHING IN THE ROOM. \nTHE BREATHING IS JOINED BY THE HISSING OF GAS AS IT'S BEING RELEASED. \nTHE CREATURE FORCES POISON GAS OUT INTO MORGAN'S UNCONSCIOUS FACE. \nTHE ROOM IS ENGULFED WITH STREAMS OF SUNLIGHT FROM THE BROKEN WINDOWS.  THE LIGHT SEEMS TO CATCH CERTAIN THINGS IN THE ROOM AND MAKE THEM STAND OUT.  THINGS ON SHELVES, THINGS ON TABLES, THINGS ON THE WALL. \nGraham stares at the baseball bat on the wall.  Beat. \nGRAHAM (soft) Swing away, Merrill. \nMorgan's face is obscured by gas. \nGRAHAM (loud) Merrill. \nMerrill turns and looks to Graham. \nGRAHAM Swing away. \nGraham's eyes are not on Merrill.  Merrill follows his eye line to the baseball bat mounted above him. \nBeat.  Merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting place. \nThe creature starts to move. \nMerrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks forward.  He stops.  His weight shifts to his right leg. \nThe creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its lines and colors don't match in position in the room. \nMerrill's left leg goes out.  His torso and shoulders turn with staggering speed and strength.  The bat slices through the air of the family room... Contact. \nThe creature gets HAMMERED across the back with the baseball bat. \nMorgan is dropped.  He falls to the carpet of the family room in an unnatural crumpled pile.  His arms and legs flop lifelessly to the carpet. \nThe creature turns to face Merrill.  All the creature sees is the BLUR OF WOOD as Merrill swings like a lumberjack.  SLAM. The creature falls to the ground. \nGraham takes Bo by the hand and moves to Morgan.  Graham picks up his son's limp body in his arms. \nThe creature moves to its feet. \nMerrill's hands choke up on the bat.  Merrill's eyes are on fire. \nGraham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine on the ground. \nMerrill SCREAMS as he swings again.  His powerful muscles pull his shoulders whipping around.  The bat connects with the creature across its chest.  The creature is thrown back into the wall.  Two glass of water fall off a shelf and CRASH ONTO THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER.  The water connects with it's skin.  The creature makes a HIGH PITCHED INHALE SOUND. \nBo and Graham look up. \nTHE CREATURE'S SHOULDER STOPS CHANGING COLORS AND WITHERS INTO A POWDERY WHITE. \n", "test1_input": "Bo nods and moves to the television.  The pack of men follow Graham up the \nSTAIRS. \nMERRILL That roof is over ten feet high. \nGRAHAM He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high. \nThey arrive on the landing and follow Graham into his bedroom.  He moves into his \nBATHROOM. \nThey all move in with him. \nOFFICER PASKI They got women's high jumping in the Olympics.  They got these Scandinavian women who could jump clean over me. \nGraham takes the clock radio from the sink.  Tries to open the back. \nGRAHAM Shoot, it needs a screw driver.  I have double A's in here. \nGraham waves the radio.  The men and Morgan move out of the bathroom. \nGRAHAM I know you're making a point Edgar. I just don't know what it is. \nThey moves down the STAIRS. \nOFFICER PASKI Yesterday afternoon, an out of town woman stopped by the diner and started yelling and cussing cause they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine. Scared a couple of customers.  No one's seen her since... My point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw.  We should just keep all possibilities available. \nThey move through the FAMILY ROOM. \nBo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon. \nBO Dad, where's the remote? \nBo starts looking around the couch. \nGraham stops before entering the kitchen.  The group stops with him.  He looks at Bo searching the couch.  He walks over to the television. \nThere are three glasses of water on the TV set.  He stands next to the set.  Doesn't see what's on the screen. \nGRAHAM Bo, you're too old to still be doing this.  The rule is, you take a glass of water, you finish it. (beat) Now what's wrong with this one? \nBo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her father.  Looks at the glass. \nBO There's dust in it. \nGRAHAM This one? \nBO A hair. \nGRAHAM This one? \nBO Morgan took a sip.  It has his amoebas in it. \nBeat.  Bo turns back to her search.  Graham tucks the clock radio under his arm and collects the three glasses.  He heads towards the kitchen. \nMERRILL Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else is a possibility? \nOFFICER PASKI I'm not done asking questions and I don't appreciate the sarcasm. \nThey follow Graham and Morgan through the swinging door into the KITCHEN. \nGraham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other half-filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a screwdriver.  He starts opening the clock radio. \nOFFICER PASKI Do you have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you? Maybe a church member, who might not have liked the fact, that you left the church? \nGraham looks at Edgar. \nGRAHAM I don't think so. \nOFFICER PASKI Do you owe anybody money?  You can tell me off the record if you need too. \nGRAHAM No. \nMERRILL No. \nMorgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts replacing the batteries. \nOFFICER PASKI Is anything missing? \nGRAHAM No. \n", "test1_true": "MORGAN It's still making the noises.  It's broken. \nGRAHAM It's old Morgan. \nMorgan heads out of the kitchen. \nMERRILL Listen, I was out of line with that whole female Scandinavian Olympian thing. \nEdgar nods. \nMERRILL It's just that, I'm pretty strong and pretty fast.  And I was running as fast as I could.  And this guy... (embarrassed smile) He was just toying with us. \nBeat.  Merrill walks out of the kitchen.  Graham watches Edgar think it over. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY \nGraham moves to a windowsill where more glasses of water sit. He picks them up.  Sees two more on the coffee table.  He gives up and puts the two glasses back on the windowsill. \nOFFICER PASKI Could everyone just take a seat on the couch.  I have some preliminary thoughts. \nMorgan sits with his monitor next to Bo, who quietly watches the TV.  Merrill and Graham squeeze in next to Morgan. \nOFFICER PASKI There are three possibilities here. We'll call them one, two and three. The level one scenario is that there is a sane individual, who for real reasons wants to do you harm. I really don't believe that's what we're looking at here.  In my opinion, whoever this is, they don't want to do harm to you all. That's kind of clear. (beat) The level two scenario is, this is a mentally unstable person who's fixated on you and your family. This is a possibility, but a very slim one. (beat) I assure you I will treat all three possibilities carefully, but in all likely hood we are looking at what we'll call a level three scenario. He's a watcher.  Someone who this is a game for.  He's laying low. Doesn't want to be seen.  But he wants to watch you.  Study you folks. \nOfficer Paski walks towards the windows.  Graham, Merrill and Morgan follow him with their eyes.  Officer Paski walks next to the television. \nON THE SCREEN WITH THE SOUND ALMOST MUTED, IS AN AERIAL SHOT FROM A HELICOPTER.  A DIFFERENT ONE THAN BEFORE.  THE FOOTAGE IS OF A VAST FIELD OF CROPS.  THERE ARE TWO DIAMONDS FLANKING TWO SIDE OF A TRIANGLE IN THE CENTER OF THE FIELD. \nOfficer Paski turns to them. \nGraham, Merrill and Morgan stare at the screen. \nOFFICER PASKI Now I don't want you all to worry about this no more.  You're making more of this than it is. (beat) You guys have had a tough couple of days with the vandalism to the crops and the death of your shepherd. (beat) Maybe you guys should do something fun?  Let me worry about this person.  Let me find out who it is and then -- What the hell are you people looking at? \nEdgar comes around to see the screen. \nWE ARE ON A TV SCREEN.  THE CROPS SWAY IN THE BREEZE. \nA HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ARE WAVING FROM THE DIAMONDS ON THE FIELD. \nOFFICER PASKI I'll be damned. \nGRAHAM Turn up the volume Bo. \nBo gets up. \nBO I can't find the remote. \nShe presses the up arrows on the TV controls. \nTV ANCHOR -- images were shot yesterday afternoon by a thirty-four year old local camera man in Kerala, a southern city of India.  It is the eighteenth reported crop circle found in that country in the last seventy-two hours. \nThe television report cuts to Columbia University PROFESSOR. \nPROFESSOR (TV) Crop circles first emerged in the late seventies with the renewed interest in extraterrestrial life. They died out by the early eighties; dismissed as hoaxes. This new resurgence is wholly different.  Elements of it are unexplainable.  The speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries... (beat) There is only a limited amount of explanations.  Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically... (beat) It's for real. \nMorgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes in deeply. \nMORGAN (wonder) Extraterrestrials. \nOFFICER PASKI What in God's name is going on? \nBeat. \nTHE ROOM GOES SILENT as everyone watches the images on the television screen. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  HESS DRIVEWAY - DAY \nThe two men walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car. \nOFFICER PASKI Don't ask me what I think.  Cause I can't think straight right now. I'm going back to the station. Have a cup of Marcia's coffee and try to think clear.  After that I might make some calls. (beat) Hoaxes... People got way too much time on their hands. \nEdgar turns back to Graham. \nOFFICER PASKI But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes.  You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago. \n", "test1_id": 3072, "test2_input": "MORGAN MOVES THE BEAM DOWN TO THE PICK, WHICH IS WEDGED BETWEEN THE DOORKNOB AND THE GROUND.  THE PICK WAVERS A LITTLE WITH EACH PUSH FROM THE OTHER SIDE, BUT HOLDS. \nTHE SCRATCHING AND MOVEMENT OUTSIDE THE DOOR BEGINS TO LESSEN. \nBeat.  Morgan slowly moves THE BEAM BACK UP TO HIS FATHER'S FACE. \nGRAHAM Where's Bo? \nTHE BEAM SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS.  THROUGH THE BOXES, BETWEEN THE SHELVES... IT SETTLES ON A SMALL FOOT HIDING BEHIND A COUPLE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD.  BO'S HEAD SLOWLY APPEARS.  SHE SQUINTS AS SHE LOOKS IN THE LIGHT. \nBO I'm okay. \nANOTHER BEAM COMES ON.  IT REVEALS MERRILL AT THE SHELVES WITH A SECOND FLASHLIGHT.  HE LOOKS OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE SHELVES NEAR HIM.  BEAT. \nHIS BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON A RADIO. \nHe turns the knob to \"on.\"  The radio lights up, but no sound emerges for it's speakers.  Merrill turns the channel knob and checks all the stations.  No sound.  No signal.  He listens to the LIGHT HUM FROM THE SPEAKERS. \nBeat. \nMERRILL What's happening out there? \nBeat. \nGRAHAM (in the dark) I can't even imagine. \nTHEY ALL LISTEN TO THE DEAD AIR HUM FROM THE RADIO SPEAKERS. \nMORGAN I hope they're doing better than we are.  We don't even have helmets. \nTHERE IS A LOUD BANG. \nBOTH FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CRISSCROSS OVER THE BASEMENT AND COME TO A STOP ON THE DOOR. \nANOTHER BANG.  THE DOOR VIBRATES.  THE PICK WITH THE WOODEN HANDLE HOLDS IN PLACE. \nBANG. \nGRAHAM STEPS INTO THE BEAM OF LIGHTS.  He looks at the door and then turns and faces the lights. \nGRAHAM They're just making noises. They're not trying to get in. (beat) Why are they doing that? \nGraham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness.  Morgan moves his BEAM ONTO MERRILL. \nMERRILL They want our attention on the door? \nBANG.  A beat of silence. \nGRAHAM They're distracting us? \nMERRILL From what? \nMORGAN The book says they're probably very good problem solvers. \nMERRILL What book! \nMORGAN They'll find a way in. \nBANG. \nGRAHAM Morgan, give me your flashlight. \nMorgan puts the FLASHLIGHT ON THE GROUND AND ROLLS IT ACROSS THE FLOOR.  THE BEAM SPINS IN TINY CIRCLES SHOWING THE BROKEN GLASS OF THE BULB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR. \nTHE FLASHLIGHT COMES TO A STOP IN GRAHAM'S PALM.  He picks it up. \nGRAHAM Is there an air vent in here? \nMerrill moves next to Graham.  ANOTHER BANG FROM THE DOOR. \nThey aim their FLASHLIGHTS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  The brothers move in opposite directions. \nGRAHAM MOVES HIS BEAM UP AND DOWN CHECKING THE WALLS AND THE CEILING AS HE MOVES. \nMERRILL MOVES BETWEEN SHELVES, ONE AT A TIME.  HIS FLASHLIGHT PEERS BEHIND THE STACKS OF CANNED GOODS. \nA BANG ECHOES THROUGH THE BASEMENT DOOR. \nMerrill and Graham are at opposite ends of the room now. \nGRAHAM I can feel air. \n", "test2_true": "THE TWO BEAMS OF LIGHT START MOVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER. \nGRAHAM It's getting stronger. \nMERRILL I'm close. \nBANG. \nTHE BEAMS MOVE UP AND DOWN OVER THE FINAL WALL.  GRAHAM AND MERRILL MOVE CLOSER AND CLOSER... THE TWO BEAMS FINALLY COME TO A STOP IN THE SAME PLACE... THEY SHINE DOWN ON MORGAN. \nHE SITS ON THE GROUND AGAINST THE WALL.  HE STARES UP AT THE TWO LIGHTS. \nMORGAN What? \nIN THE BEAM OF LIGHTS YOU CAN SEE HIS HAIR MOVING GENTLY FROM A BREEZE. \nGRAHAM AND MERRILL TURN THEIR LIGHTS STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR VENT HE'S LEANING AGAINST. \nEYES ARE REVEALED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE VENT.  A NARROW SET OF METALLIC COLORED FINGERS SHOOT OUT BETWEEN THE HOLES IN THE VENT GRILL AND GRAB MORGAN. \nMORGAN SCREAMS.  THE FLASHLIGHTS DROP TO THE GROUND.  THERE'S A DESPERATE SCRAMBLE.  FEET MOVE THROUGH THE BEAMS OF LIGHT. \nWE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. \nMERRILL (O.S.) Hold the vent! \nSOMEONE PICKS UP A FLASHLIGHT.  WE SEE GLIMPSES OF STRAINING FACES.  MORGAN SCREAMING. \nGRAHAM Pull him! \nTHE FLASHLIGHT IS DROPPED AND PICKED UP AGAIN.  WE SEE IT IS BO WHO IS HOLDING THE LIGHT. \nBO TURNS THE LIGHT AT THE VENT.  MERRILL IS THE ONLY ONE THERE.  HE PRESSES ONE OF THE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD AGAINST THE METAL GRILL.  HE DRAGS THE SECOND BAG OVER WITH HIS FOOT AND SLAMS IT AGAINST THE FIRST BAG.  HE QUICKLY MOVES OUT OF THE LIGHT. \nBO FOLLOWS HIM WITH THE BEAM.  SHE FINDS HIM DRAGGING AN ENORMOUS BAG OF FLOUR OVER TO THE VENT.  HE HEAVES IT ON TOP OF THE PILE.  HE LEAVES THE LIGHT AGAIN.  RETURNS WITH ANOTHER GIANT BAG OF FLOUR.  GRUNTS AS HE THROWS IT ON TOP OF THE REST. \nMERRILL FALLS TO THE GROUND EXHAUSTED.  THE PILE OF DOG FOOD AND FLOUR COMPLETELY OBSCURE THE VENT.  A CAN OF SOUP ROLLS ON THE GROUND NEAR MERRILL.  HE SLOWLY PICKS IT UP AND PUTS AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT OUNCES ON THE PILE. \nMerrill slowly catches his breath.  He reaches over to his side and grabs the remaining flashlight.  HE TRAINS THE BEAM AROUND THE ROOM TILL HE FINDS MORGAN. \nHE FINDS THE BOY IN GRAHAM'S LAP.  MORGAN IS SEATED WITH HIS BACK AGAINST GRAHAM'S CHEST.  USING HIM AS A CHAIR.  MORGAN'S FACE IS PALE.  HE IS TAKING VERY LONG SLOW HEAVES.  IT SOUNDS LIKE THE AIR IS GOING THROUGH A STRAW.  HE'S SUFFOCATING. \nGRAHAM LOOKS UP INTO THE LIGHT. \nGRAHAM We don't have his medicine. \nMerrill looks at his nephew turning gray. \nGraham pulls Morgan closer to his body and talks into the child's ear. \nGRAHAM Don't be scared Morgan.  We'll slow it down together.  Feel my chest. Feel it going in and out.  Breathe like me.  Breathe like me. \nMorgan's throat is closing -- his face is filled with strain and panic. \nBO He can't breathe. \nBo moves to Merrill and curls up with him as they watch. \nGraham closes his eyes.  Beat.  He opens his eyes and talks into Morgan's ear. \nGRAHAM Stay with me.  Stay with me.  I know it hurts.  Be strong baby... It'll pass. \nGraham closes his eyes -- talks to the darkness. \nGRAHAM Don't do this to me again.  Not again. \nMerrill stares at his brother's desperate face. \nGraham's eyes open as Morgan's tiny fingers press down on Graham's hand.  The fingers squeeze with all the strength they have. \nGraham looks to Merrill helplessly.  Merrill's eyes fill up with water. \nGraham's eyes close. \nGRAHAM I hate you.  I hate you... \nGraham's eyes open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear. \nGRAHAM The fear is feeding it... Don't be afraid of what's happening... Believe it's going to pass... Believe it... Just wait... Don't be afraid... The air is coming... Believe... We don't have to be afraid... It's about to pass... Here it comes... Don't be afraid... Here comes the air... \n", "test2_id": 3073, "test3_input": "A THIN STREAM OF SOUND EMITS FROM MORGAN'S THROAT.  LIKE THE SOUND OF AIR LEAKING FROM A BALLOON. \nGRAHAM There we go... We don't have to be scared at all... We know it'll pass.  We believe it... Don't be afraid Morgan. \nMorgan's fingers relax a little on Graham's hand. \nTHE LEAKING BALLOON SOUND TURNS BACK INTO THE SOUND OF AIR THROUGH A STRAW. \nMerrill watches as Graham's face stays pressed up against his son. \nGRAHAM Feel my chest... Breathe with me. Together... The air is going in our lungs... Together... We're the same.  We're the same. \nMerrill watches as Morgan's chest starts to move in sync with Graham's. \nTHE SOUND OF THE STRAW FADES AS MORGAN'S BREATHING TURNS INTO LABORED BREATHS. \nGraham's eyes close.  He starts crying.  He speaks to no one. \nGRAHAM (soft) I hate you. \nMorgan's fingers relax on Graham's hand.  Merrill watches as father and son breathe together.  Merrill and Bo hold each other tight. \nTHE FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS ON GRAHAM AND MORGAN'S EXHAUSTED FACES.  THEY BOTH STARE OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE BASEMENT.  TEARS DRYING ON THEIR CHEEKS.  THEY'RE BOTH LOST IN THEIR THOUGHTS. \nBeat. \nMERRILL I should save the flashlights. \nBeat.  Graham nods without looking over. \nMERRILL PRESSES THE BUTTON ON HIS FLASHLIGHT.  THE BEAM OF LIGHT ILLUMINATING GRAHAM AND MORGAN GOES OUT.  THEY DISAPPEAR INTO SHADOWS. \nMerrill looks down to Bo, who has the second flashlight in her hand.  THE BEAM POINTS UP AT THE BASEMENT CEILING ABOVE HER AND MERRILL. \nMerrill nods to her.  She reaches down and presses the button. \nTHE BASEMENT IS ENGULFED BY BLACK. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  BASEMENT - MORNING \nWE ARE STILL IN BLACK.  A VOICE IS HEARD IN THE DARKNESS. IT'S MURKY AT FIRST, THEN BECOMES CLEARER. \nVOICE ... Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have also confirmed. \nGraham opens his eyes from sleep.  HE SQUINTS FROM THE LIGHT OF THE HANGING BULB IN THE BASEMENT. \nMerrill steps into his vision. \nMERRILL I found a pack of light bulbs. \nMerrill walks back to the radio on the metal shelf.  THE VOICE WE HEARD IN THE DARKNESS COMES FROM THE TINY SPEAKER OF THE RADIO. \nRADIO VOICE ... Parts of China and Northern Korea are among the few remaining to verify withdrawals. \nGRAHAM They're broadcasting... \nMERRILL It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up. (beat) We won Graham. \nMerrill waits for his brother to say something.  Beat. \nMERRILL It went on all night.  Everywhere. It was completely a ground battle. Mostly hand to hand.  You can't see them unless you're up close.  A lot of people died.  Some from combat. But most from poison gas inhalation.  They secrete it. \nBeat. \nGRAHAM How many died? \nMERRILL They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates. (beat) But we held strong. \nGRAHAM How do they know it's over? \nMERRILL A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now. (beat) They're leaving. \nBeat. \nMERRILL You didn't think we'd make it. \nBeat. \nGRAHAM No. \n", "test3_true": "Merrill's face is hard.  He looks shaken.  Graham stares at the conviction in his younger brother's expression. \nGRAHAM (soft) Okay. \nBeat. \nTHERE'S A WHEEZING SOUND FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  Graham and Merrill turn to look at Morgan -- laying down on Merrill's folded sweater.  Morgan's breathing is strained. He still looks grey. \nMERRILL He's been like that for awhile.  We need to get him some medicine. \nGRAHAM Have they said anything about our area? \nMERRILL Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure? \nGraham looks at Morgan lying limp on the ground.  Graham turns to Merrill. \nGRAHAM (whispers) He's not strong enough to fight off another attack. \nMERRILL (whispers) I know. (beat) We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham. \nThe two men stand under the single dangling light bulb. Graham quietly turns and looks at Morgan.  He moves across the room towards him. \nMerrill watches as Graham kneels down and reaches to Morgan's side.  Graham unclips the baby monitor from his son's belt. \nGraham walks back to Merrill.  He holds it out between them. Beat. \nHe turns it ON. \nA SLIGHT STATIC IS HEARD.  GRAHAM TURNS THE VOLUME ALL THE WAY UP.  THE STATIC GETS A LITTLE LOUDER, BUT DOESN'T CHANGE. THERE ARE NO NOISES, NO SPIKES, NO VOICES... JUST EMPTY ELECTRICAL STATIC.  Beat. \nGraham makes eye contact with Merrill.  Beat. \nMERRILL That's good enough for me. \nGRAHAM Me too. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BASEMENT STAIRWELL - MORNING \nDAYLIGHT FILTERS DOWN FROM THE KITCHEN AND PIERCES THE STAIRWELL TO THE BASEMENT. \nThe basement door cracks open a few inches.  Beat.  Merrill opens it all the way. \nDUST FLOATS UP IN THE DAYLIGHT THAT SPILLS DOWN THE STAIRS. \nMerrill moves up the stairs by himself.  He reaches the top and looks around.  Turns back down to the faces at the bottom.  Gives them the thumbs up. \nGraham leads Bo up the stairs.  He carries a limp Morgan in his arms. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  KITCHEN - MORNING \nTHE KITCHEN IS KIND OF BEAUTIFUL IN ITS DESTRUCTION.  BEAMS OF DAYLIGHT CRISSCROSS THE ROOM FROM THE PUNCHED OUT HOLES IN THE WINDOWS AND BOARDS. \nTHE BACK DOOR IS WIDE OPEN. \nWE HEAR SOUNDS FROM THE TV FILTERING IN FROM THE HALL. \nGraham and Bo and Morgan watch as Merrill walks over the toppled chairs to get to the cabinets. \nGRAHAM Get the syringe as well.  We might need to give him an epinephrine shot. \nMerrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that have fallen from the cabinets. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING \nSHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT STREAM IN FROM ONE SIDE OF THE FAMILY ROOM WHERE THE WINDOWS HAVE BEEN BROKEN IN. \nGraham gently lays Morgan on the sofa. \nWE HEAR CHEERING COME FROM THE TELEVISION, FILTER THROUGH THE FRONT HALL AND INTO THE FAMILY ROOM. \nBo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room. \nBO People are dancing. \n", "test3_id": 3074}

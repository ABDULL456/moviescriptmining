{"test1_input": "Graham steps through the back screen door into his \nKITCHEN. \nGraham holds the phone a little closer and talks in a HUSHED VOICE. \nGRAHAM (into phone) Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it was him.  You could just talk to him and that would be enough for me... See it was kind of strange finding the crops like that.  The kids were... confused by it.  It would take the strangeness away if we knew it was Lionel and the Wolfington brothers just messing around... (beat, listens) The movies... (beat) Are you sure? (beat) Okay, then... Thank you for your patience Lee. \nGraham turns off the phone.  He turns to put it on the counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen floor with one of their two German Shepherds.  There is a LARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles. \nMORGAN Houdini peed.  I think he's sick. \nGraham looks at the majestic dog.  It's shivering. \nGRAHAM Take him outside.  I'll call Dr. Reynolds. \nMorgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on their faces. \nGraham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the puddle of urine.  The DOORBELL rings with Graham still on his knees on the kitchen floor.  He leans back so he can see down the hall. \nA balding police officer stands on the other side of the screen door. \nGRAHAM That was quick Edgar.  I only called you boys about two hours ago. \nOFFICER EDGAR PASKI nods that he knows. \nOFFICER PASKI Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as she put it, \"diving for her life\" when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards. She went down to Thorton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.  Spitting! By the time I got there, Mrs. Kindleman had sprayed the whole damn place... She must have had a cold or something.  It was enough to turn a grown man's stomach. \nBeat.  Graham stares at Officer Paski. \nOFFICER PASKI So what happened to your crops? \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  BACKYARD JUNGLE GYM - LUNCHTIME \nBo walks from the house with a large glass of water.  She moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table. \nMorgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the grill.  He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers, before walking over to Houdini. \nThe two children sit down in the grass with the dog. \nBo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl. She stops.  Takes a tiny sip of the water first. \nShe holds the glass out to Morgan. \nBO I think it's contaminated. \nMORGAN You don't even know what that word means. \nHe drinks. \nMORGAN It's not contaminated.  It's just tap water.  Pour it in his bowl. \nBO It tastes funny. \nMORGAN He licks his butt everyday.  He's not going to mind. \nBo shrugs and pours it into the bowl.  Beat. \nHoudini just sits staring at them.  He is not shivering.  He doesn't drink.  He is unnaturally still. \nBo pushes the bowl closer. \nHOUDINI MOVES... \nBO'S HAND PULLS BACK... \nHOUDINI'S JAWS SNAP SHUT IN THE AIR WHERE HER HAND USED TO BE.  HE WAS JUST A FRACTION OF A SECOND LATER... \nBEAT.  The children turn white. \nMORGAN Houdini? \nHOUDINI BEGINS TO GROWL.  Bo stands up. \nMORGAN Bo don't run. \nHoudini crouches down. \nMORGAN What's wrong boy? \n", "test1_true": "MORGAN Stop it Houdini! \nThe German Shepherd trembles.  His body tightens.  He's about to leap.  Beat. \nMORGAN (soft) Bo, run. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CROPS - LUNCHTIME \nOfficer Edgar Paski stands facing Graham fifty feet away. They are on opposite ends of the crop circle.  Beat. \nThe crops all around them sway as the wind blows.  Beat. Officer Paski yells over the wind. \nOFFICER PASKI (yelling) It's the strangest thing Father. \nGRAHAM (yelling) Don't call me Father. \nOFFICER PASKI (yelling) What's that? \nGRAHAM (yelling) Don't call me Father.  It's just Graham now. \nOFFICER PASKI (yelling) Sorry. \nThey stands in awkward silence fifty feet away from each other.  Beat. \nGRAHAM (yelling) You said something was strange. What's strange? \nOFFICER PASKI (yelling) The footprints. \nGRAHAM (yelling) What about them? \nOFFICER PASKI (yelling) There are none. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  CORN CROPS - LUNCHTIME \nOfficer Paski's knee touches the ground.  He points to a single stalk of corn laying flat on it's side. \nOFFICER PASKI (soft) Look at where it's bent over. \nGraham stands next to him and leans in.  The joint where the stalk bends from the ground is a perfect \"L\". \nGRAHAM It's not broken. \nOFFICER PASKI What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it? \nGraham looks around at the hundreds of thousands of corn stalks bent over each other in a perfect wave. \nGRAHAM (softy) Can't be by hand... It's too perfect. \nBeat. \nOFFICER PASKI Doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.  They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants. \nGraham, nods in agreement.  Officer Paski stands up. \nOFFICER PASKI Second thing this week I can't explain. \nGRAHAM What was the first thing? \nOFFICER PASKI Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior.  Sometimes violent behavior.  Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow. \nGRAHAM Sounds like a virus. \nOFFICER PASKI No Father, they're edgy.  On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything. \nWe see a thought catch in Graham's eyes.  He turns back and stares in the direction of the house.  You can barely see the roof over the crops.  Beat. \nGRAHAM (preoccupied) Edgar, please don't call me Father. \nThe two men stand as the wind blows lightly around them. Officer Paski notices the still expression on Graham's face. \nOFFICER PASKI What's wrong? \nBeat. \nGRAHAM I don't hear my children. \n", "test1_id": 3072, "test2_input": "MERRILL (whispers) Do you think it's a possibility? \nGRAHAM (whispers) Yes. \nMERRILL (whispers) How can you say that? \nGRAHAM (whispers) That wasn't the answer you wanted? \nMERRILL (whispers) Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be?  Give me some comfort? \nBeat.  Graham thinks it over. \nGRAHAM (whispers) ... There are all different ways you can tell that there's someone really there watching out for us. You see signs.  Sometimes they're little ones.  You think of someone. The phone rings.  They're on the phone... Sometimes they're big, like fourteen lights hovering over Mexico City. (beat) Sure, there are a lot of people watching this who think this could be a bad thing.  But there are a lot of people watching this, who think it's a miracle.  A sign of God's existence.  It's all in how you look at things Merrill. (beat) What you have to decide is what kind of person you are?  Are you the type who believes in miracles and looks for signs or are you the kind who believes, things just happen by chance? \nBeat.  Merrill is deep in thought. \nMERRILL I was at this party once.  I'm on a couch with Sara Mckinney.  She was just sitting there, looking beautiful and staring at me.  I go to lean in and kiss her and I realize I have gum in my mouth.  I turn and take out the gum.  Stuff it in my paper cup next to the sofa and turn around.  Sara Mckinney throws up all over herself. (beat) I knew the second it happened.  It was a miracle.  I could have been kissing her when she threw up. That would have scarred me for life.  I may never have recovered. \nMerrill looks at the TV screen.  Beat. \nMERRILL I'm a miracle man.  Those lights are a miracle. \nGraham smiles. \nGRAHAM (whispers) There you go. \nBeat. \nMERRILL (whispers) So which type are you? \nBeat. \nGRAHAM (whispers) Do you feel comforted? \nMERRILL (whispers) Yes. \nGRAHAM (whispers) What does it matter then? \nThe two of them turn back to the silent screen of the television.  It's a long beat before Graham speaks. \nGRAHAM (whispers) Do you know what Colleen's last words were before they killed her? \nBeat.  Merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother. \nGRAHAM (whispers) She said, \"See\", and then her eyes glazed a bit and she said... \"Tell Merrill to swing away.\" \nMerrill's mouth opens a bit.  Graham turns and chuckles at his expression. \nGRAHAM (whispers) Do you know why she said that? \nMerrill nods, \"No.\" \nGRAHAM (whispers) Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games popped into her head. (beat) There is no one watching out for us Merrill.  We're all on our own. \nGraham turns back to the television.  Beat. \nTHE LIGHT OF THE TELEVISION FLICKERS ON THE FACES OF THE TWO BROTHERS AS THEY SIT WATCHING IN SILENCE. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY \nGraham's eyes open.  DAYLIGHT FILLS the family room.  He is alone on the couch.  Alone in the room. \nHe looks to the television.  It's not there. \nGraham moves to his feet and look around the room.  His eyes stop on an EXTENSION CORD that runs from a wall outlet in the family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door. \nGraham moves to the door.  WE HEAR MUFFLED TELEVISION VOICES. Graham opens the \nCLOSET. \nMerrill looks up.  He's seated on a kitchen chair with the television on a roll-away stand crammed in with him. \nMERRILL For the kids protection.  All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m.  I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right? \nGRAHAM What's furry, furry rabbit? \nMERRILL (points) That's a game isn't it? (beat) Anyway... (points at the TV) There's been some interesting developments. \nGRAHAM What time is it? \n", "test2_true": "Beat.  Graham looks at the TV screen.  There's a daylight shot of Mexico City.  The skies are empty above it. \nMERRILL But they're not really gone.  We just can't see them.  Early this morning a bird flew right at the area where the lights were hovering last night. \nMerrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen. \nMERRILL It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down. \nMerrill's finger trails to the bottom of the screen. \nMERRILL They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning.  They found the bird.  His head crushed in.  When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky. (beat) They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion. \nGRAHAM The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell. \nMERRILL Already thought of.  Two other birds did the same thing an hour later.  Not as dramatic.  They lived.  But you could see they hit something. \nGraham looks at the empty sky on the screen with different eyes. \nMERRILL They're still there hovering.  In fact, some people think there's more of them now.  All over the place.  Over us even. (beat) And there's a theory about the crop circles now.  They think it could be some kind of landmark, visual mapping system -- so they can navigate.  Coordinate.  Makes sense doesn't it? \nCUT TO: \nINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY \nWe are inside Graham's bedroom facing his bathroom door, which is closed.  The same sun-faded outline of where a large cross used to hang, is stained on the wall next to the door. \nGraham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair. He towels it dry as he moves to his bedroom window. \nWE LOOK OUT THE SAME WINDOW WE LOOKED OUT AT THE VERY BEGINNING. \nThe backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym.  A single tree throws shade onto a picnic table.  The back of the yard is lined by corn crops.  Golden and brown.  Six feet high. \nThe crops go on well beyond our view.  Graham stares at them quietly.  Watching. \nBeat.  THE SOUND OF WHISPERING DRAWS HIS ATTENTION FROM THE WINDOW. \nHe listens closely.  HIS CHILDREN ARE WHISPERING IN THE NEXT ROOM. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - DAY \nGraham walks into the hall and looks in their room. \nMorgan and Bo are seated on the edge of their bed.  They have TIN FOIL wrapped around their heads like a helmet.  Graham stares at his children. \nMORGAN So the aliens can't read our minds. \nGRAHAM Oh. \nMORGAN They tell you everything in this book. \nMorgan holds up the book he bought from Nathan's bookstore. \nGraham enters the room.  The children make space for him on the bed.  He takes a seat between them.  Morgan puts the book on his father's lap. \nMORGAN It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet. \nGRAHAM Who wrote this book? \nGraham looks on the back cover for a picture.  There's none there. \nMORGAN Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs. \nGRAHAM That means they're unemployed. \nMorgan closes the book. \nMORGAN Dad, are you going to be serious? \nBo points at the book. \nBO Yeah, serious. \nGraham looks at his two children with foil on their heads. \nGRAHAM I don't know what got into me. \nBeat.  Morgan puts the book on his father's lap. \n", "test2_id": 3073, "test3_input": "GRAHAM (soft) It's happening. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING \nMerrill pounds furiously with his hammer as he nails boards to the children's bedroom door.  The master bedroom door is open with a board leaning next to it.  Graham is inside his bedroom \nCUT TO: \nINT.  GRAHAM'S BEDROOM - EVENING \nGraham walks to the window next to his bed.  It's the same one we've looked out twice before. \nGraham looks out onto his backyard.  The FLOOD LIGHT FROM THE HOUSE THROWS LONG SHADOWS OVER THE YARD.  There is a light breeze.  Nothing seems wrong. \nGraham's eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on into darkness.  He moves closer to the glass.  Watches the top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind. \nSOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS. \nGraham's eyes moves to where the corn crops fade into black forty feet away.  Graham goes very still. \nLINES EMERGE IN THE CROPS; THE KIND OF LINES MADE BY SOMEONE TRAMPLING THROUGH A FIELD.  WE CAN'T SEE WHO'S MAKING THEM. ALL WE SEE ARE THE COUNTLESS LINES BEING FORMED.  THE LINES MOVE FROM THE DARKNESS TOWARDS THE HOUSE.  GRAHAM WATCHES THEM CLOSE IN ON HIS BACKYARD.  THIRTY FEET... TWENTY FEET... TEN... \nGraham backs away from the window towards the middle of his bedroom. \nMERRILL Graham hurry. \nGraham turns to see Merrill standing with the last board in the hall.  Graham moves out into the hall and shuts the bedroom door behind him. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING \nMerrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts hammering nails into the frame.  Graham picks up his hammer and quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood. \nGraham glances to his right as he works.  Bo and Morgan are standing together at the top of the stairs.  Bo holds Morgan's hand. \nGraham keeps hammering as he speaks. \nGRAHAM Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo? \nBo nods \"no\" lightly. \nGRAHAM You came out of your momma and you didn't even cry.  You just opened your eyes and looked around at everybody.  Your eyes were so big and gorgeous, the ladies in the room gasped. \nGraham stops hammering.  Merrill keeps going. \nGRAHAM They literally gasped. (Graham gasps like them) Then they go, \"She's like an angel.\"  They said, \"We've never seen a baby so beautiful.\" \nGraham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment.  Merrill finishes hammering. \nGraham goes over and picks up Bo. \nGRAHAM (soft) And you know what else happened? \nBo nods, \"no.\" \nGRAHAM (soft) When they put you on the table to clean you up, you looked at me and smiled.  They say babies that young can't smile... You smiled. \nGraham looks at his daughter quietly.  He brushes the hair out of her face as Merrill moves to Morgan and picks him up. \nAll four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors. Beat. \nGRAHAM (soft) Let's go down now. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING \nGraham puts Bo down in the hallway.  She stands close to him. Merrill puts down Morgan.  The four of them stand quietly in a tight group. \nTHEY HEAR FRANTIC BARKING IN THE DISTANCE. \nMORGAN We forgot about Isabelle. \nISABELLE'S BARKING BECOMES DESPERATE AND ANGRY.  THEY LISTEN AS SHE BARKS NONSTOP FOR TEN SECONDS... AND THEN SUDDENLY STOPS. \nTHE LOW EMERGENCY TONE FROM THE CLOSET TV FILLS THE SILENCE. \nBeat. \n", "test3_true": "GRAHAM (soft) They already know we're here. \nTHE FIRST SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT ARE HEARD OUTSIDE.  CREAKS OF WOOD FROM THE FRONT PORCH CAN BE HEARD. \nTHERE IS SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT FROM BEHIND THE LOCKED BACK DOOR. \nSOUNDS OF MOVEMENT AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE.  SOUNDS FROM ALL DIRECTIONS. \nTHERE IS SCRATCHING NOISES AGAINST THE FRONT DOOR.  METAL NOISES AS THE HANDLE IS TRIED. \nMORGAN (almost inaudible) Dad -- \nTHE DOOR CREAKS AS PRESSURE IS PLACED AGAINST IT. \nGRAHAM Do you know what happened when you were born Morgan? \nMorgan looks at his father, unable to speak. \nGRAHAM You came out and your momma kept bleeding.  The doctors rushed you out of the room before I could even see you. \nTHERE ARE THUDS ABOVE THEM. \nAll four look up. \nMERRILL They're on the roof. \nGRAHAM While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you. \nTHEY LISTEN AS THE THUDS INCREASE IN NUMBER. \nTHE FIRST SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS IS HEARD FROM UPSTAIRS. \nMerrill looks up the stairs at the boarded bedroom doors. \nMERRILL They're in the house. \nGraham takes Morgan's hand. \nGRAHAM I wanted your momma to see you first.  She had dreamed about you her whole life. (beat) They waited till she felt better, then they brought you in.  They placed you right in her arms.  And she looked at you.  And you looked at her.  You just stared at each other for the longest time and then she said real soft, \"Hello Morgan, I'm you momma, you look just like I dreamed.\" \nGraham smiles down at his son who smiles gently back. \nSCRATCHING NOISES BEGIN TO COME FROM UPSTAIRS. \nThe group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs. The BEDROOM DOOR HANDLES ARE BEING RATTLED. \nMerrill's eyes moves quietly above the bedroom doors, to the ceiling of the upstairs hallway.  He stares at a rectangle in the ceiling.  A tiny rope hangs from the rectangle.  Beat. \nMERRILL The attic door. \nMerrill sprints up the stairs. \nMorgan and Bo watch as Graham follows after Merrill. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING \nGraham and Merrill stare up at the ceiling.  There is movement right above them.  Dust falls from a ceiling light right next to them. \nThe rope hanging from the attic trapdoor hangs between them. They watch as it begins to twitch and sway. \nThe springs in the trap door begins to GROAN.  The door starts to fall open. \nMerrill and Graham raise their arms above their head and reach up.  The door opens a few inches.  Merrill is taller. The door presses against his fingers first.  It gives a few more inches before Merrill stops it. \nGraham's finger are barely touching it.  Merrill's face turns red with strain as something pushes down on the door. \nMERRILL This is a very temporary solution. \nGraham brings his arms down.  He sees his children watching from the bottom of the stairs.  Graham looks around where he is.  There is a very small table with photos against a wall. A laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors... nothing else.  Graham turns to Merrill. \nGRAHAM How temporary? \nMerrill's face is a deep crimson. \nMERRILL Twenty-two seconds. \nGraham looks around again... the same things... the same table... the same closet... Graham stops and stares at the closet.  It has a wooden folding door that opens and closed on a guide rail.  The wooden folding door is very tall.  Its top is one foot from the ceiling. \n", "test3_id": 3074}

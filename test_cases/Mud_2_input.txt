By the time Ellis makes it back home, the sun has gone from the sky. He crosses the makeshift plank to board his house. 
SENIOR (O.S.) Home for dinner? Ellis is startled by his father's voice. Senior sits in a lawn chair under the eaves of the carport. He's hidden in shadow, save for a red glow from the tip of his cigarette. 
ELLIS What you hidin' for? 
SENIOR I ain't hidin'. He notices Senior tip back a pint of liquor and set it at his feet. Ellis opens the screen door leading inside. 
SENIOR (CONT'D) Come over here. Ellis lets the door fall shut and skulks over to a beam that supports the carport. He leans into it. 
SENIOR (CONT'D) You know I love you? 
ELLIS Yessir. I know. 
SENIOR I work you hard 'cause life is work. You know that? 
ELLIS Yessir. 
SENIOR Your Mamma's been talkin' 'bout movin' in town. 
ELLIS What's that mean? 
SENIOR She seems set on it. Wants to separate. She may ask me for a divorce. This hits Ellis like a ton of bricks. He rights himself. 
ELLIS What's that mean for me? 
SENIOR It means enjoy the river son. Enjoy it while you live on it, 'cause this way a life isn't long for this world. Game and fish's 'bout made certain of that. 
ELLIS But you and me can still live out here. Game and fish can't take your boat. Not while you're still in it. 
SENIOR The houseboat's in your mother's name. Her daddy give it to her not me. If she wants to leave it, Game and Fish has ever' right to take this boat apart board by board. 
ELLIS But that ain't right. You work outta here. We got the ice machine, the traps. What are we supposed to do? 
SENIOR Like I said, this is your mother's business. 
ELLIS I ain't no townie. I ain't livin' like that. Senior takes a slow pull off the bottle. Ellis' mind races. 
SENIOR I've let you down. A man should be in charge of his own affairs, but I haven't worked it like that. 
ELLIS But ya'll are married. Ya'll are s'posed to love each other. 
SENIOR I don't know about that anymore. 
Ellis is speechless. After a moment, he turns to go inside. 
SENIOR (CONT'D) Ellis? He stops and turns back to his father. Senior tries to express a sentiment he doesn't have the words for. Ellis continues inside. 
40 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - CONTINUOUS 40 
Mary Lee sits hunched at the made dinner table. She runs her finger around the rim of a half empty glass of iced tea. It's a full spread with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and a salad. The table is set for two. She's been waiting. Ellis lets the front door slam shut behind him. She sits up. 
MARY LEE You're late. Ellis doesn't speak, he doesn't look at her. He enters his room and shuts the door. He's heard the news and she knows it. Mary Lee's face drops. 
41 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS 41 
Ellis slings his backpack down, pacing the small room. He stops and leans his forehead against the door. The sound of his Mother clearing the table seeps through. He kicks the door, cracking its shitty composite wood. His face flushed and his breathing heavy, he slides to a seat. On the verge of hyperventilating, he stares out the dark bedroom window trying to get control of his breathing. Ellis looks at his backpack. It has spilled open revealing a can of Beanie Weenie. Ellis studies the can. He looks back to the window. His breathing settles. Quickly, he scoops up the backpack and heads out the window. 
42 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT 42 
It's pitch black. The only light comes from the moon's reflection off the surface of the water. Ellis, eyes wide, navigates the small boat through choppy black water. 
43 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT 43 
Ellis struggles to pull the boat onto shore. Leaving it half in the water, Ellis looks around. No sign of Mud. He sizes up the dark woods. He removes a flashlight from his backpack and shines it down the shorelines. Still nothing. Ellis follows the beam of light into the woods. 
44 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - NIGHT 44 
Ellis stands at the creek that cuts through the island. He can make out a campfire glowing through trees in the distance. A RUSTLING behind him. He swings the light around. Nothing but trees. Ellis takes a deep breath. Finding the log to cross, he shines his light down into the creek. The nest of snakes show their backs. 
45 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - NIGHT 45 
A campfire burns at the base of the tree. The firelight illuminates the belly of the boat that rests 20 feet above. Ellis, his flashlight off, crouches behind a tree and watches the campsite. There is no one there. He looks into the black forest behind him, thinks of going back. A twig snaps in the distance and he's back on guard. Ellis nervously scans the woods before finally stepping into the light of the campfire. The SOUND of a gun's hammer drawing back CLICKS behind him. Ellis freezes. Mud emerges from the trees, a .45 extended toward Ellis' back.

{"test1_input": "Crow Horse appears to be getting on his bike when suddenly he moves like a cat and lays his knife to the dead man's head. He cuts away a patch of hair. \nCOOCH What the hell you doing?! \nCROW HORSE His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony. (wrapping lock of hair) Has to be kept for four days. \nCooch and Ray stand there, watching Crow Horse mount his bike and push off down a nasty slope back through the Badlands. He starts his motor. It dies. Then starts again. \nCOOCH Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something? \nRAY Beats the hell outta me. \nRay and Cooch look off across the Badlands, as far out of their element as they can be. \nCLOSE ON - THE WHITE EAGLE PLUME \nin the circle in the sand, fluttering in the wind. \nThe gold spit-shined Le Baron eases to a crawl, passing an old wooden sign. \"Leaving Bear Creak Indian Reservation.\" \nAnd immediately pulling in front of a squat old bar with a burned out neon Miller light. DWIGHT YOAKUM croons \"Youuuuuu- Got-Your Little-Ways\" on the jukebox from inside. \nThe Buffalo Butte bar has several cracked and sun-bleached buffalo skulls hanging off the edge of its flat roof and big faded white letters painted across the front read: \"No Indians Allowed.\" \n(This sign actually exists today in the res-line border town of Scenic, South Dakota). The car pulls up beside a pick-up and parks. Ray and Cooch step out, careful to walk wide around a PITBULL in the bed of the truck. \nA WHITE LOCAL walks out of the bar and looks askance at the suits. As the two feds approach the bar, Cooch looks up at the warning sign. Ray sees it too. \nCOOCH Sorry, Ray. You're gonna have to wait in the car. I'll bring you out a cheeseburger. \nThe young agent smiles, amused, starts to enter the bar but -- \nVOICE (O.S.) Hey! \nRay spins quickly, paranoid about entering. But the man calling to them is -- \nAn Indian himself. TRIBAL PRESIDENT OLIVER CLEAR MOON, a small man in his late fifties who peers out at the agents through fat bifocals. He wears a straw cowboy hat, red windbreaker and his hair is cut short, or \"bobtailed\" as the Indians say. \nClear Moon is walking away from a parked pick-up truck, toward the white men, eyeing the two with deep curiosity. \nCLEAR MOON (heavy Indian accent) You made it. Was-te. \nCooch discreetly peeks into a folder as he walks toward the man \nCOOCH You must be... President Clear Bone. \nCLEAR MOON Clear Moon. (pointing to the sky) Moon. You must be the Sioux. \nHe is pointing his long, skinny finger at Cooch. \nCOOCH No. That's Ray here. Ray... \nRAY (quickly) Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure. \nClear Moon beholds the young agent with hopeful eyes, a smile breaking across his flaccid brown skin. He takes Ray's hand in a respectful double-clutch and grips him tightly... almost desperately. \nCLEAR MOON It's about time they sent us one of our own. Was-te. \nHe keeps pumping Ray's hand, looking into his face with great admiration. Cooch looks on with amusement. \nCLEAR MOON Things are no good here. It is like war zone. We need an official who understands what is good for the Indian people. Who knows Indian way. \nClear Moon has not released Ray's arm as he leads them to a string of seedy motel units across the street. \nRAY I thought we were staying on the reservation. \nCLEAR MOON Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land. \nRAY I see. \nCLEAR MOON Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck. \nRAY Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set. \nCOOCH He's starving, Mr. Clear Moon. Get him some raw kidney. He hasn't had any Indian food in days... \nAnd Clear Moon guides them through the front door of room 13. Ray looks over his shoulder threateningly at Cooch who winks and pats his back. \nEXT. RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT \nA lone headlight appears out of the black. HEARTBEAT DRUM. But faster. Relentless. A \"res\" car, a dented, rusted, peeling old station wagon, drives slowly toward the reservation. \nThen suddenly, someone steps in front of the car. A BIG MAN in cowboy boots and blue jeans. \nINT. MOTEL - ROOM 13 - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "He gets out of bed quickly, snatching up his pants, putting their on, and going to the window. \nPOV - OUT WINDOW: \nSEVERAL LOCALS out in front of the bar help a middle-aged INDIAN MAN out of the station wagon. \nWHITE LOCAL Where you goin'? Back to the res? \nA young local bends down behind the Indian while another shoves him, sending him tripping over the bent man and onto his back in the dirt. \nWHITE LOCAL What ya doin'? You drunk? \nMORE LOCALS come out from the bar, beers and drinks and interested in what's going on. \nREVERSE - RAY \nat the window, observes. Cooch enters from the connecting room, puffy-eyed but quickly buttoning his shirt. He shares Ray's view. \nCOOCH Let's take a walk. \nRay is transfixed. \nEXT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - NIGHT \nThe Indian man, is pushed into a stumble, and caught by another white man as a little game of catch takes place. Cooch, stepping into the circle, shirt half unbuttoned, hair a mess, looks on. Then steps in front of a big local and catches the Indian as he comes stumbling. He holds onto him, looking at the faces that turn his way. Ray steps up beside him, looking tense. \nCOOCH What's goin' on here? (a beat) I can't walk across the goddamn street without some breed-ass fallin' all over me? \nAnd then Cooch shoves the Indian with all his might back across the road. The locals resume their fun, and Cooch looks at a local man and shares a chattering laugh that makes Ray do a serious take. \nCOOCH Watch out now, he wants a kiss, Ray, wants a kiss -- \nThe Indian ends up stumbling back toward Ray, and Ray catches him this time. The man maintains a perfect vacant expression and keeps acting as though nothing of the sort is happening. But he is dizzy, and exhausted, and Ray keeps him from falling. \nCooch looks at Ray. Their eyes meet. Ray shoves the man forward. This time, instead of catching him, the local on the receiving end, hauls off and punches him in the face. The Indian drops. \nCooch runs in, grabs the Indian under the arms and drags him back to his car. \nCOOCH Go ahead, skin, get your ass back on your sacred land. Get outta here. \nHe shoves him behind the wheel as the locals crowd around. They don't see Cooch throw the wheel stick in drive, and lean into the man's ear. \nCOOCH Get outta here. Drive. \nCooch slams the door, and kicks it, and the vehicle lurches forward. A beer can clanks off the rear window, and rolls clanking into the middle of the road. \nRay stands there with the locals as they all watch the car drive off across the reservation line. Cooch, belly sticking out of his unbuttoned shirt, and a breathless smile on his face, heads to the bar without breaking stride. This man has done \"underground\" before. \nINT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER \nCooch and Ray sit in a booth with DENNIS VAUGHN, a strapping local man, ranch-raised, and gentlemanly. In fact, downright likeable. \nDENNIS So what type of salesmen are you gentlemen anyway? \nRAY Liquor. We heard they like their drink on the reservation, and we were gonna see if we couldn't unload some surplus on the way to Nebraska. \nCOOCH Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here. \nDENNIS Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver. \nBROOKS, a small, older man with a feed store cap and a clean cowboy shirt, comes over with a beer and a pensive look on his face. He pulls up a chair and positions himself at the end of the booth. \nDENNIS Liquor salesmen. Be nice to them, maybe they'll give you a sample of some of that gin you like. (to Ray) He likes that Russian shit that -- \nBROOKS They ain't liquor salesmen. They're FBI. \nCooch and Ray don't flinch. Dennis does. He looks between the two, cautiously. \nCOOCH Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like. \nDENNIS FBI? What you investigatin'? \nCOOCH A murder. On the reservation. \nDENNIS Again. Figures, man. \nBROOKS You'll never find out who did it. \nCOOCH You underestimate me, Brooks. \nBROOKS No. You underestimate these grass niggers. They're killing each other. That's all they do. Get drunk and kill each other. Then cover for each other. Who gives a damn really as long as they stay on their reservation. You ask me, the government shouldn't care one particle. \nDENNIS You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is. \n", "test1_id": 1410, "test2_input": "CROW HORSE He says there's something wrong with Big Bird -- he's crazy, (stops laughing) He says you stopped the Inipi ceremony last night...? \nCrow Horse turns a questioning look at Ray. Ray doesn't flinch. \nCROW HORSE But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you. \nRAY He knows me? \nCROW HORSE He says he saw you in a vision some time ago. \nCrow Horse stops translating suddenly even though the old man continues speaking. Crow Horse looks concerned, and ASKS A QUESTION IN LAKOTA. We don't know what he's asking but the tone is absolute amazement. \nThis question triggers an exchange between he and Grandpa, the old one getting angry. Grandpa wins. \nCROW HORSE I guess he had this vision some time ago, in the Moon of the Popping Trees -- uh, back in the winter. He says you come from Wasi'cu city in the East but that your people... way back... are of the Minniconjou Sioux. But you yourself don't know that. \nRay's brow is drawn tense as he stares at the old Indian, absorbing the translation. Grandpa speaks more fervently now, incorporating Indian sign. Each time Grandpa does the hard Sioux HAND SLAP, Ray blinks. \nCROW HORSE He says he knew you'd be coming to Bear Creek. He was told. It is the will of Tunkasilia -- the grandfather that you come here. He says let's smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe, symbol of truth. So that there will be no lies between us. \nThe old man has taken a long wooden stem and a red stone bowl from a beaded pipe bag. He joins the two together then begins offering a pinch of tobacco to the Four Directions. While this goes on, Ray fidgets. \nRAY What's he smoke in that? \nCROW HORSE Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament. \nThe old man is offering the pipe to Ray. \nGRANDPA Mltaku Oyasin. \nRay looks at Grandpa. The old man offers the pipe again. \nCROW HORSE You don't smoke with him, it means you're hiding something. \nRay takes the pipe, looks at it... then passes it to Crow Horse. The big Indian takes it from Ray, giving him a long eye, then offering the pipe to The Directions before smoking. \nCrow Horse puffs hard, eyes closed, then slowly releases some smoke upward. Ray watches it climb and fade. The old man then takes up an old turtle shell rattle. He speaks. \nCROW HORSE He says Wakan. Sacred. Five hundred year old turtleshell rattle, passed down from the Grandfathers. Heavy duty. \nHe shakes the rattle very slightly, moving it in front of Ray. He speaks just above a whisper. \nCROW HORSE He says, it is good. The Spirits are here. The Spirits want to know what you're doing here? \nRay smirks. \nRAY Tell him I'm trying to find the man who murdered Leo Fast Elk. Ask him if he knows where he is. \nCrow Horse asks the old man in Lakota. No answer. The pipe is back to grandpa, and he offers it to the Directions, to the Earth then upward before smoking himself. He begins to speak again. \nPassionately. In long glottal Sioux sentences, adding sign, fingers crossing, brushing an arm, a slap here and there, \nHe is working himself into an excited state, and Ray keeps looking at Crow Horse, very interested in the old man's answer. \nFinally Grandpa's breath comes up short and wheezing, he ends his oratory with a solid hand slap. \nRAY What did he say? \nCROW HORSE He said he doesn't know. \nRAY He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say? \nCrow Horse ignores him. Grandpa speaks again. More hand language. \nThe old man is staring at Ray while whispering to Crow Horse. He strokes his badger claw necklace. \nCrow Horse looks at Ray and seems hesitant to translate this new piece of information. \nCROW HORSE Uh... Grandpa likes to trade; no one stops by here without gettin' stuck in the old Indian barter. He, uh... he likes your shades. \nGrandpa smiles toothlessly. Ray who has his driving glasses in hand, lifts them to say \"these?\" but Grandpa sees it as an accepted deal, and swiftly removes his necklace. He holds it out. \nRay slowly, hesitantly surrenders his sunglasses, and takes the necklace. Crow Horse bursts into laughter and so does Grandpa, enjoying a good trade. He draws a hand through the air in a sort of horizontal karate chop, meaning done deal. Ray looks confused. Out of his element. And out of his shades. \nAnother fly gets snagged on sticky tape. \nEXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER \nCrow Horse is hurrying toward his bike, Ray with him. \nRAY What was he saying? \nCROW HORSE Why should I tell you. \nRAY Because he was talking to me. \n", "test2_true": "RAY Does he know something? \nCrow Horse stops walking and eyes Ray, deliberating. \nCROW HORSE The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week. \nRAY And... \nCROW HORSE He saw an owl. \nA silent moment. Ray tries to figure out what he's missing here. \nRAY So what? \nCROW HORSE The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo. \nRay stares vacantly. \nRAY The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court? \nCROW HORSE He also said \"listen to the water.\" \nRAY Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster. \nCROW HORSE Go back to your DNA finger-printin'. \nCrow Horse KICK STARTS his bike and burns off down the drive \nRay feels the presence of the old man, standing behind the busted screen door. Just watching. \nOVER THIS, A SCREAMING. A HIGH-PITCHED, CHILLING, SCREAM that takes us straight into -- \nSLACK TAIL POWWOW GROUNDS - RES - LATER \nCLOSE ON A TERRIFYING FACE -- painted in blazing red and yellow, black around the eyes. A ridge of feathers high along the hairline, and a mouth open, tongue trilling -- SCREAMING. \nA WACIPI \nis going down. A Powow. Held in the center of a huge arbor. This DANCER, a traditional Kit Fox dancer, is dressed in authentic costume and is dancing with TEN OTHERS dressed in various traditional garb and paints. \nUnder the arbor, TWO HUNDRED INDIANS in modern clothing sit on blankets or in lawn chairs, watching the dancing. A group of SINGERS sit around a big drum, beating on it, and wailing the song that keeps the dancers hopping. \nSIXTY CARS (res beaters) are parked off around the arbor, less interested kids sitting on them, smoking cigarettes. A few actually have MTV hair-cuts. \nDrifting through the cars and people are Special Agents Couture, Miles, Sherman and Levoi. They stroll through, incongruously, checking out faces. Vehicles. \nRay slows his step and takes in -- \nTHE POWWOW CIRCLE \nas the dance ends. WEAK APPLAUSE. The POWWOW CALLER, a big Sioux with a crew-cut and cowboy shirt, speaks through a scratchy P.A. system. \nCALLER Was-te Yelo! Let's have five more veterans. Five more veterans. Hoka Hey! \nAn OLD-INDIAN MAN sitting in a lawn chair, removes his cowboy hat and reaches down toward a blanket. He brings up his VFW hat, adorned with medals and puts it on. Slowly, he rises, and shuffles out to the center pole along with -- \nFOUR OTHER VETERANS who have exchanged cowboy hats for veteran's caps. There is even a traditional dancer in there, wearing a veteran cap. As a mournful WAR SONG is banged out by the singers, a flag is unrolled by the veterans. An American Flag. Unrolled, and set on the mast. And together, all five Indian men, hoist -- \nTHE AMERICAN FLAG \nhigh. Slowly it climbs. Proudly. It blows in the hot South Dakota wind. \nOUTSIDE THE ARBOR \nRay stands, watching this. And then the SONG ENDS. A loud, angry voice breaks across the P.A. \nAT THE CROW'S NEST (CALLER'S BOOTH) \nANDERSON CHASING HAWK, a young Indian in ribbon shirt and long hair has taken possession of the microphone. SIX W.A.R.N. MEMBERS stand behind him. He speaks loud, firm, with the sharp gestures of an old way Chief. \nCHASING HAWK What is that that you honor there, uncles? After all the Wasi'cu country has done to you, after all he still does to you, you honor that flag?! That flag has been desecrated by the United States, because they have not honored what that flag represents! \nThe veterans just stand under the flag, solemn, looking at Chasing Hawk. The flag undulates soundlessly. \nCHASING HAWK (O.S.) To them, we are the Bank of America. Whenever they get into a little difficulty, they go to The Bank, withdraw a little land, withdraw a little oil -- \nOUTSIDE THE ARBOR \nthe four FBI agents stand, watching. \nMILES Okay. Here we go. \nCOOCH Who's this guy? \n", "test2_id": 1411, "test3_input": "With RADIO TRANSMISSIONS crackling through the house, Cooch comes back down the hall, and heads to the door. \nCOOCH Trailer's clean, let's go. \nRay starts to follow but he sees Sherman pick something up from near Grandpa. The 500 year-old turtleshell rattle. Grandpa's eyes widen slightly. \nSHERMAN You been the one making it rain like that, out there, Sam? \nRAY Hey, put that down. \nSHERMAN Can you make Jimmy outrun an M-16, Sam? \nRAY Sherman! \nSherman drops the turtleshell rattle on the linoleum floor. Then drives his heel into it, CRUSHING the fragile turtleshell. \nRay grabs him and slams him into the tin wall. Miles gets between them, grabbing Sherman. \nMILES EASY, MEN! HEY! -- \nRADIO HE'S ON THE ROOF! HE'S ON THE FUCKING ROOF! COME ON GUYS, COME ON, GUYS! \nThey're out the door, leaving the old man to sit looking down at the shattered rattle. He closes his eyes. \nEXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER \nIn a blizzard of rain, Jimmy Looks Twice in a cowboy shirt, jeans and boots, leaps off the top of the Airstream, clutching his medicine bundle. FLOODLIGHTS HIT him from all directions. BULLHORNS screaming at him. \nHe tries to turn a corner and runs right into a fed. Ray, having run out the back door has slammed right into him. He has his rifle on him, and they stare each other down for a split second before he is converged on. Guns at his back, at his head. \nHe is swept off his feet, face down, and frisked. He looks up at Ray, desperately. \nLOOKS TWICE Brother, the old man told me about you. Listen to me: what was Leo trying to tell me? He wanted to meet me at Maisy -- \nAnother fed, pushes his face into the mud, cuffs him behind his back. \nFED Save your speeches for prison, Jimmy. \nWith two FIVE MAN SWAT TEAMS swarming the area, and six agents pushing Jimmy toward a car, Cooch stands there in the pouring rain, looking relieved. Ray stands near him, looking abhorred. \nCOOCH Damn. That's one hard running Indian. \nRay watches Jimmy as he is shoved into the back of Miles and Sherman's car and driven away. He is twisting around in his seat to look at Ray. Desperately. The SWAT teams disband, return to their vehicles. \nCOOCH It's over, Ray. I aged five years. But it's over. At least I'm gonna look like I'm ready for the advisory desk. Let's go get a beer. \nCooch heads to his car and Ray starts shuffling toward his as if he is dared by it all. He is looking at the trailer and there on the rickety porch is Grandpa. He comes down the steps slowly, holding his hat on against the wind. He watches the cars pulling out. \nRay walks over to him, looking sick. \nRAY Look... I'm not who you think I am. (a long beat) I'm sorry. \nAnd after a moment of locking gazes, he starts for his car, \nGRANDPA Out back that way... is a placed called Wounded Knee. \nRay turns. \nGRANDPA I was one years old there when our people were shot down. My mother hid me in the snow in a blanket. One of those killed was a Holy Man called Wakiyan Cante -- Thunder Heart. They killed him while he was running for The Stronghold. It is his blood -- the same blood that spilled on the grass and snow at Wounded Knee -- that runs through your heart like a buffalo. \nRay frowns, disturbed by this story. \nThe old man is speaking with conviction. With power. \nGRANDPA Thunder Heart has come. Sent here to a troubled place to help his people. That's what I am told. Maybe you're right and I am mistaken. Your mind is young, mine is old. If so, so be it. Ho Hecetu Yelo. I'll speak no more. \nRay stands, almost paralyzed, digesting this. He turns and looks into the old man's sharp eyes. Grandpa has closed his eyes, and as he is pulverized by the rain, he turns his face toward it and from way down in his belly, he begins to SING IN LAKOTA. And it is too much. Too weird. He wheels and hurries to the car. Gets in, and beats a fast path out of the old man's lonesome patch of land. \nBLUE HEAT LIGHTNING knifes the sky. THUNDER ROLLS, and rumbles into POOL BALLS -- \nEXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL AND BAR - LATE DAY \nThe agents have taken over both sides of the streets, gathered in front of the bar and the motel, putting firearms into cases, removing flak jackets. \nPOOL BALLS knock from inside the bar while outside, A DAKOTAN takes a piss near a truck while his GIRLFRIEND stands at his back, yelling at him. CHARLIE DANIELS sings country on the juke Ray heads to room 13, starts unlocking the door. Cooch comes up behind him. \nCOOCH Buffalo burgers and cold beer, Raymond. Don't worry about the sign out front... you don't have to be Indian anymore. \nCooch throws a mock punch at Ray and he mock blocks, tired. He musters a smile. But he isn't all there. \nCOOCH You have a fever. You okay? \nRay nods. Cooch lets a few agents walk past, LAUGHING. He speaks quietly. \nCOOCH Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta. \n", "test3_true": "COOCH Cuz I want New York. \nRay tries to break a smile again. Cooch cups his arm. \nRAY Cooch. They sent us out here because the place was being neglected. Now, all of a sudden, there's two five man SWAT teams out there tonight. Bell Huey choppers flying all over the place. Federal occupation to catch one guy. Why, Cooch? What's going on? \nCooch stares at Ray. The younger agent looks like he indeed has a fever. \nCOOCH National security, Ray. Get some sleep. Tomorrow, we fly. \nCooch hurries across the rain-swept street. Ray steps inside and closes the door. \nINT. ROOM 13 - BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL \nRay closes the door, and stands there. He seems to be having trouble breathing. He looks down at his boots. There is something on the floor. Something that has been slipped under the door earlier. He just stares down at it. Then slowly stoops. \nCLOSE ON: the polaroid of the res car he gave to Maggie earlier. She \nhas returned it. He turns it over. Written across the white backing of the photo, in dark black marker is the name -- YELLOW BIRD. \nRay stares at this for a moment then hurries over to boxes of files on the bed. He rummages like a nervous thief and comes up with a folder. He flips through it, casting off files and 302's and profiles and finally stopping on -- \nThe 8x10 BLACK AND WHITE of Richard Yellow Bird seen earlier. Sitting in his wheelchair, Red Power cap on, tattoos marring big arms. And under it a DOUBLE MUG SHOT stamped LEAVENWORTH PRISON. Under that ANOTHER PRISON MUG SHOT stamped SIOUX FALLS PRISON. And under that a -- \nTHIRD MUG SHOT stamped \"PAROLED.\" \nRay, his eyes fixed on this one, takes a few steps and sits on the end of the bed. He then stuffs the file back in a box, and takes off toward the door. \nEXT. RESERVATION ROAD - SUNSET \nThe Le Baron throws up loose rock and red dust, driving toward a place where the sun begins a slow drop behind the Black Hills. HORSES run out of the road. HEARTBEAT DRUM. \nEXT. MULE DEER DISTRICT \u0096 RES - SUNSET \nA tarpaper shack. Outhouse. Clothesline on which jerked meat hangs. No cars. A lonely, unnerving place. Le Baron pulls in. Ray gets out, adjusting the gun at the back of his waistband. He starts for the shack. Ray raps a fist on the splintered plywood door. Knocks again. He checks out a boarded- up window. The door finally opens. Just a crack. Tiny black eyes peer out into the fading light. \nRAY I'm looking for Richard Yellow Bird. \nRay sticks his open badge, gold eagle wings, near the crack. The door closes. Then unlatches and opens. Yellow Bird sits there in his wheelchair, tiny tobacco bundles in his lap. He's been tying them. \nYELLOW BIRD The Washington Redskin. Thought you'd be gone by now. \nHe pivots his chair to allow Ray room to enter. \nINT. YELLOW BIRD SHACK \nYellow Bird, in a T-shirt that reveals twenty different ink tattoos, rolls himself across the warped floorboards to a cheese crate where his eye glasses sit. He puts the thick bifocals on and focuses resentfully on Ray in the ochre flicker of the dirty room. \nYELLOW BIRD What ya want? \nRAY Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it? \nYELLOW BIRD Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know. \nRAY At Sioux Falls Pen? \nYELLOW BIRD No, that was Leavenworth. This -- (shows a scar) was Sioux Falls. What ya want? \nRAY Leavenworth a tough joint? \nRay walks across the room, his eyes on a covert mission. \nYELLOW BIRD You ever try solitary confinement? \nRAY No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here? \nYELLOW BIRD Washington sent ya. I know that. \nRAY Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard? \nYellow Bird stares at Ray. \nRAY An arrangement was made between you... and us. Do you remember that arrangement? \nYellow Bird looks at Ray, strangely, shaking his head. Ray starts to look like maybe the game's not working. Like maybe this doesn't add up. But -- \nYELLOW BIRD I'm here, ain't I? \nRay lets a tense breath out. \nRAY Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver. \nYELLOW BIRD What the fuck you talkin' about? \n", "test3_id": 1412}

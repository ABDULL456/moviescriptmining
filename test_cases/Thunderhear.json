{"train": "THUNDERHEART \nWritten by \nJohn Fusco \nFourth draft \nOct. 5, 1990 \nA DRUM. Beating slow. And deep. Like a heart. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. THE GREAT PLAINS SOUTH DAKOTA - DAWN \nSomething is rising from the Black Hills. A sphere of light, too red to be the sun. A sphere of contained fire, undulating in crimson and ochre, and rising slowly, majestically, to the pulse. To the DRUM. It is the sun. But it is a Paha Sapa sunrise. A Black Hills sunrise. And it is spectacular. \nThe DRUM, pounds deeper, bigger, as the sun gets higher. Stronger. Igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and foothills; throwing shadows on the plains that look like, as the Indians say, an old man dancing. The grass is golden. And high. The wind moves through it, snakes through it. Slowly. \nBEGIN CREDITS. \nVoices; a TRADITIONAL INDIAN SONG (Lakota), summoning Wakan Tanka - The Great Mystery. \nAnd now, rising up over one of the small land waves, a head comes into view. Shoulders. A man, running in ghostly SLOW MOTION, his long black hair trailing in the wind. The INDIAN MAN wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around his neck. \nLegs and arms churning, the man runs with antelope grace, backlit by the sunrise, bounding toward us. Running... his heart pounding. SONG RISING... DRUM POUNDING... FIVE MORE VOICES in high-pitched tremolo join the song. \nAnd then the runner soars, like an eagle from a bluff, airborne, flying over a small dip, arms outstretched, and it would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine, crimson, mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly overtaken by LIVE SPEED, revealing the brutal force of gunfire which has slammed the Indian into the air, throwing him. Slamming him hard into the grass. And it is over as quickly and violently as a deer shot dead. \nLAKOTA SONG ends abruptly. \nLONG SHOT - THE GREAT PLAINS \nthe sun burns like lava at the horizon. DRUM beats like a heart. And Somewhere off in a distant cottonwood, an OWL. Then Silence. Deep, disturbing stillness. \nEXT. CAPITAL BELTWAY - WASHINGTON. D.C - DAY \nROCK N'ROLL shatters the silence. \nCars -- a multicolored metallic criss-cross reflecting off a building made of mirrors -- races past an electronic billboard that blinks in red skyhigh digital: PRUDENTIAL LIFE INSURANCE. 7:59. 73 degrees. \nThe D.C. Superhighway. And off behind it, in the distance, Capital Hill holds imposing vigil, the massive cast iron dome of The Capital, catching the sun. But everything is soon smothered by a METRO BUS, hogging the far lane of the Beltway, leaning on its HORN. \nGood morning. \nAnd the rock n'roll is everybody's radio, everybody's tempo. \nCARBON MONOXIDE WAVE \nshimmers across the beltway hugging then releasing a solitary vehicle that we stay with... move with... A black Nissan 240 SX, hard-waxed. \nINT. 240 SX - TRAVELING \nBehind the wheel -- an intense young man with close-cropped black hair, eyes hidden by sunglasses. Whatever he does for a living, he does in a suit (not expensive but well-fit. But we might also note that any extra suit cash has gone instead into the silver-plated watch on his left wrist). Lean as a rake, sallow in the cheeks, there is something insatiable about him -- a hungry energy that won't let him go. \nRAY LEVOI, late 20's, early 30's, pulls out of a threatening traffic jam and races on the narrow right between thirty cars and a cement girder. \nEXT. T STREET - OUTSIDE WEST-CENTRAL \nThe black SX has jumped off an exit and has entered the light- industrial section of Washington. It pulls up near a loading dock behind an old gray building and several parked cars and vans. Ray steps out, smooths his jacket, locks and SETS HIS CAR ALARM. \nAnother young man -- chubby, clean-shaven; in a nicer suit than Ray's -- steps out from a parked Miata, and approaches Ray. CARL PODJWICK balances a coffee, a U.S.A. Today and a black eel-skin briefcase. \nCARL Hey. \nRAY Hey. Nice tie. \nCARL Don't get too attached. \nThey start walking briskly toward the loading dock. \nRAY Ya got the paper? \nThey mount steps. \nCARL Yeah. \nRAY You're my hero, Carl. \nCARL Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me. \nRAY Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones. \nThey stop at the door of a service elevator and Carl breathes. Expanding his chest, exhaling. Ray adjusts Carl's tie for him, his collar. He speaks quietly. Quickly. \n8x10 BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOS dealt like cards onto a table, one on top of another. \n1 -- an aerial shot of some wasteland. \n2 -- a closer bird's eye of the same, what looks like a NASA photo of Mars. \n3 -- a vast expanse of the Great Plains. \nROBERT F. TULLY, Number-Two-in-Command, deals a fourth photo onto the table. He is an understated, fatherly man, well- manicured in cotton pencil-striped shirt, white-tab collar and tie. The photos and maps and files a foot deep on the huge table are neatly organized. \nINTERCOM SA Levoi, Sir. \nTULLY Please. \nSeated, at the far end of the table, engrossed in the deep spread of information, SA (Special Agent) FRANK COUTURE is about to break the record for longest single ash on the end of a cigarette and the smoke forces his eyes into tight, concentrating, slits. \"COOCH\" as they call him in the Bureau has seen thirty years in some rough \"provinces\". He has survived the Hoover era and is a legend in the Sessions era but survival has honed an edge. An edge with a touch of ironic cop humor. \nRay enters, walks into a firm shake. \nTULLY Ray... \nRAY Mister Tully. \nTULLY Do you want a coffee? \nRAY No. No, no. Thank you. \nRay sits nervously across from Cooch who looks up from the photos and studies the younger man through reading glasses and cigarette smoke, and he looks at him like he doesn't know who the hell he is or why he's sitting there. \nTULLY Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division. \nCOOCH Oh, yeah -- right. \nCooch sticks his cigarette in his left hand, shakes with his right. \nTULLY Ray this is -- \nRAY / TULLY Frank Couture. \nTULLY That's right. \nCOUTURE Hello, Ray. \nThe handshake is still locked. Cooch is still squinting at the younger agent. Ray obviously knows something about Agent Couture. \nRAY It's an honor. \nTully leans back in his chair, crosses his legs casually. \nTULLY Ray, we're taking you off the street. We need you out in South Dakota. \nRay's enthusiasm suddenly deflates. \nRAY South Dakota... (confused) Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir? \nCOOCH No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother. \nRay looks completely baffled now, swinging a look from Cooch to Tully. \nTULLY Interesting bloodline you have, Ray. (scanning file) French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian. \nCOOCH Sioux Indian, right? \nRAY I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think -- \nTULLY -- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side. \nRay nods, looks from Tully to Cooch. What's going on here? \nTULLY Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation. \nCOOCH It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit. \nTULLY The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable. \nCOOCH Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent. \nTully straightens the edges of a bureau memorandum. \nTULLY With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe -- \nRAY Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But -- (laughing) I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and -- \nTULLY -- your father was part Sioux. \nA beat. Ray lowers his eyes to the photos. \nA DEAD BODY \nlying face down in the rainbow sand. Dried blood and horse flies cover his blown out torso. The agents stand over him, breathless from the rugged walk. \nCOOCH Who found him? \nMILES Indian kids. Hunting fossils. \nCooch studies the body from where he stands. Sherman hands a file over to Ray. \nCOOCH Okay. I think Agent Levoi and I can proceed from here. What are your call signals? \nSHERMAN PX-10 and 11. Anything we can do to help you out, just radio. \nCOOCH Good. Thanks, Guys. \nThe agents start back through the Badlands. Ray is already squatting a safe distance from the body, covering his nose with a kerchief while looking in the file. \nCooch takes a bended knee on the other side of the body. Flies buzz on and around the corpse. \nRAY Leo Fast Elk... Thirty seven... single... Member of the Tribal Council. \nCooch makes a note then slowly circles the body. He holds a hand out to Ray and the younger agent turns the file over. \nCOOCH Looks like Fast Elk wasn't fast enough to outrun that load. What do you make of the damage? \nRay gets closer, swats at Flies with the folder. \nRAY Six rounds. 357. \nCOOCH That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away. \nRay looks up impressed. Cooch rises and walks off gingerly, scanning the surroundings. \nRAY Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure. \nCOOCH Ray. \nCooch is standing ten feet away, staring at the ground. Ray walks over, carefully. He follows Cooch's frown down at the twisted layers of earth. \nON THE GROUND \na circle has been etched deep in the soft gumbo, and in the center of the circle, a white eagle plume sticks straight up, dancing in the wind. \nCooch and Ray each lower themselves to their haunches to study the strange sight. Cooch puts his reading glasses on, stares at it. Then lights a cigarette. \nRay hefts up a camera and begins CLICKING off shots. He starts moving around it, taking shots at different angles. And then the sound of a DISTANT MOTOR draws both agent's attention. \nPOV: \nway out in the bizarre moonscape of eroded rock and earth, a lone figure on a motorcycle bounces and grinds, born out of a silvery heat mirage. It's fifty yards off but heading straight for us. The HEARTBEAT DRUM. \nREVERSE - RAY AND COOCH try to make the figure out. \nIN THE BADLANDS \nthe archaic mud-caked Harley chugs and stalls, spits and choices, and begins an incredible drive straight up the steep side of this natural wonder. At the throttle is an imposing figure. \nWALTER CROW HORSE is a portly Indian in his late-thirties with a black reservation hat worn low over a face that seems to have been cast from a bust of Sitting Bull. Sitting Bull with aviator shades. Denim jacket over checkered shirt. Faded jeans. Well broken duct-taped boots. His hair is worn long in tight duel braids. \nThe rusted bike bajas up and down slopes, finally stalling out, twenty feet or so from the murder site. Crow Horse swings his bulk off the bike like dismounting a horse. He looks around suspiciously then pulls a rolled-up blanket from the carrier rack. \nLEO LITTLE SKY \nlies in death. Crow Horse's boots move in stealthily, creaking like saddle leather. \nHe squats and looks at the corpse... then looks around with animal alertness. He reaches into the front pocket of his jacket and pulls out some Bull Durham tobacco. He pinches some and offers it to the four directions around the body. \nHe then unrolls the blanket, begins to move the dead man... sense something and wheels to see Cooch standing behind him, one hand behind his back where his gun must be, and the other hand holding up open wallet. The sun hits his badge. \nCOOCH Good morning. \nCrow Horse hawks his eyes onto a big rock, a full second before Ray steps out, his .45 drawn but held at ease. \nCrow Horse slowly raises his arms as Ray moves up to him, studying him. \nCOOCH Taking ol' Leo somewhere? \nCROW HORSE Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial. \nRAY This is a restricted area. \nCOOCH Check him out, Ray. \nRay frisks the Indian, finds an old leather wallet, and then a gun. A .38. \nCrow Horse appears to be getting on his bike when suddenly he moves like a cat and lays his knife to the dead man's head. He cuts away a patch of hair. \nCOOCH What the hell you doing?! \nCROW HORSE His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony. (wrapping lock of hair) Has to be kept for four days. \nCooch and Ray stand there, watching Crow Horse mount his bike and push off down a nasty slope back through the Badlands. He starts his motor. It dies. Then starts again. \nCOOCH Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something? \nRAY Beats the hell outta me. \nRay and Cooch look off across the Badlands, as far out of their element as they can be. \nCLOSE ON - THE WHITE EAGLE PLUME \nin the circle in the sand, fluttering in the wind. \nThe gold spit-shined Le Baron eases to a crawl, passing an old wooden sign. \"Leaving Bear Creak Indian Reservation.\" \nAnd immediately pulling in front of a squat old bar with a burned out neon Miller light. DWIGHT YOAKUM croons \"Youuuuuu- Got-Your Little-Ways\" on the jukebox from inside. \nThe Buffalo Butte bar has several cracked and sun-bleached buffalo skulls hanging off the edge of its flat roof and big faded white letters painted across the front read: \"No Indians Allowed.\" \n(This sign actually exists today in the res-line border town of Scenic, South Dakota). The car pulls up beside a pick-up and parks. Ray and Cooch step out, careful to walk wide around a PITBULL in the bed of the truck. \nA WHITE LOCAL walks out of the bar and looks askance at the suits. As the two feds approach the bar, Cooch looks up at the warning sign. Ray sees it too. \nCOOCH Sorry, Ray. You're gonna have to wait in the car. I'll bring you out a cheeseburger. \nThe young agent smiles, amused, starts to enter the bar but -- \nVOICE (O.S.) Hey! \nRay spins quickly, paranoid about entering. But the man calling to them is -- \nAn Indian himself. TRIBAL PRESIDENT OLIVER CLEAR MOON, a small man in his late fifties who peers out at the agents through fat bifocals. He wears a straw cowboy hat, red windbreaker and his hair is cut short, or \"bobtailed\" as the Indians say. \nClear Moon is walking away from a parked pick-up truck, toward the white men, eyeing the two with deep curiosity. \nCLEAR MOON (heavy Indian accent) You made it. Was-te. \nCooch discreetly peeks into a folder as he walks toward the man \nCOOCH You must be... President Clear Bone. \nCLEAR MOON Clear Moon. (pointing to the sky) Moon. You must be the Sioux. \nHe is pointing his long, skinny finger at Cooch. \nCOOCH No. That's Ray here. Ray... \nRAY (quickly) Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure. \nClear Moon beholds the young agent with hopeful eyes, a smile breaking across his flaccid brown skin. He takes Ray's hand in a respectful double-clutch and grips him tightly... almost desperately. \nCLEAR MOON It's about time they sent us one of our own. Was-te. \nHe keeps pumping Ray's hand, looking into his face with great admiration. Cooch looks on with amusement. \nCLEAR MOON Things are no good here. It is like war zone. We need an official who understands what is good for the Indian people. Who knows Indian way. \nClear Moon has not released Ray's arm as he leads them to a string of seedy motel units across the street. \nRAY I thought we were staying on the reservation. \nCLEAR MOON Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land. \nRAY I see. \nCLEAR MOON Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck. \nRAY Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set. \nCOOCH He's starving, Mr. Clear Moon. Get him some raw kidney. He hasn't had any Indian food in days... \nAnd Clear Moon guides them through the front door of room 13. Ray looks over his shoulder threateningly at Cooch who winks and pats his back. \nEXT. RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT \nA lone headlight appears out of the black. HEARTBEAT DRUM. But faster. Relentless. A \"res\" car, a dented, rusted, peeling old station wagon, drives slowly toward the reservation. \nThen suddenly, someone steps in front of the car. A BIG MAN in cowboy boots and blue jeans. \nINT. MOTEL - ROOM 13 - NIGHT \nEXT MAISY BLUE LEGS HOUSE \u0096 BLACK TAIL DISTRICT - DAY \nA trailer sits off from the river in beaten solitude. There are two junked cars and one burned black. \nWind blows across deep bald tire tracks. Ray walks slowly beside them, surveying, following them to a place where they become puckers and skids next to a dilapidated outhouse. There is a shotgun blast in the side of it. Ray studies it, enters the outhouse. Exits, and walks the rutted gumbo earth to where it meets rolling hills of golden grass. He stands here, mesmerized. \nCHICKENS scratch around in the dirt. \nLike so many far-off res homesteads, this is a haunting place. Made more so by a persistent SQUEAKING, a rusty, metallic squeal coming from -- \nA WATER PUMP \nacross the yard, where MAISY BLUE LEGS, a Sioux elder, works the handle. She wears thick bifocals and keeps her hair under a bandanna. No water comes forth from the pump, and she tries again and again until she breaks a sweat. And then she sees the waal'cu standing out there. \nUrgently, she turns and starts back to her trailer with an empty coffee can. \nRay starts after her. \nRAY Mrs... Blue Legs? Can I ask you a few questions -- \nMAISY (1/3 res speed) -- go away. Leave us alone... \nRAY Ma'am, Please -- \nShe mounts the metal steps. Ray is losing her. He gets a foot on the bottom step, and attempts something he does not want to do. \nRAY Mrs. Blue Legs. I'm Indian. \nHalfway through the screendoor, Maisy turns and looks at the young man in suit and shades. \nRAY I'm Sioux. \nMaisy lowers her bifocals, studies him. Then walks in, slaps the door shut, and locks it. A towel hung as a shade folds down. \nRay lingers at the bottom of the steps. \nRAY Yeah, right. \nAnd he walks around the side of the trailer, looking at the ground. In the gaping space between the trailer blocks, and the grass, there is much junk stored, and Ray kneels to look. He is drawn to a pair of cowboy boots, caked with dried mud. He picks up a boot, looks at the sole, then touches the mud. His fingers break through the hardened crust and come back moist and blue. He looks at this sniffs it. There is a tense, water-torture like tempo coming from the old pump where water barely drips onto a hub cap in the dirt. Ray sets the boot down. Goes to grab the other boot and -- \na WESTERN DIAMOND BACK RATTLER coils out from the shade of the boot, RATTLING and HISSING from white mouth and three- inch fangs, and Ray has done a backflip and roll, slapping his shoulder holster and pulling lead and BLAM! BLAAAM! he unloads two, and the reptile is so dead, there's not even enough snake left to make a truck-stop key chain. \nHe kneels there, flushed in the face, holding his breath and double-clutching his gun. The SHOTS ECHO through the Badlands like the aftermath of dynamite. From inside the trailer, he can hear CRYING. A low moaning. Praying softly. \nRAY Shit. Mrs. Blue Legs! It's okay! \nThen his RADIO CRACKS IN. \nRADIO (COOCH) X21, give me a 20. \nRAY (yelling) Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location. \nCOOCH Maisy Blue Legs place? \nRAY How'd you know? \nCOOCH I got one up on ya. \nRAY Go ahead. \nCOOCH I've got the doer. I know who he is. \nRay looks relieved. \nCOOCH Meet me at base. Over. \nRAY Cooch. You're my hero. \nRay looks down at the dead snake, still rushed from it, and he hurries out of there. \nIN THE SHADE OF THE TRAILER \nthe snake's RATTLE moves spasmodically, still kicking with reflex. \nEXT. LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - BEAR CREEK RES - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON an AMERICAN FLAG, flapping in the hot night wind. But something is wrong about the image. The flag is hung upside lit by -- \nA full moon that also illuminates an overgrown field that fronts a small, one-level house where the flag hangs. Three old cars decorate the front yard. A busted screendoor creaks in the wind, and somewhere off in the hills, a DOG BARKS away his boredom. \nCOOCH (O.S.) Jimmy Looks Twice. \nINT. LE BARON \nSA Couture and SA Levoi sit inside the car, staking out this little place far down a dirt road on the outskirts of the settlement. \nThe archaic figure just looks through him. Starts to walk away. Ray takes his thin arm. He locks eyes with the old man. Slowly, he obeys, raising his hands and laying them on his head. \nFrom the lodge, the last man emerges. It's Crazy Horse reborn out of the burning sage. JIMMY LOOKS TWICE is in his mid- thirties -- big, well over two-hundred pounds. But lean. His braids fall nearly to his hips. His face is handsome but at the moment, twisted in a full-blood's scowl. \nLOOKS TWICE (outraged) What are you doing? \nCOOCH James Looks Twice? \nLOOKS TWICE That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating. \nLooks Twice shoots hawk-like black eyes onto Ray. \nRAY We're FBI, James. We just need to ask you a few questions. \nLOOKS TWICE We are in the middle of a sweat lodge ceremony. Do you drag people out of your churches when they're in the middle of prayer? \nCOOCH Let's take a walk, Jimmy. Come on. \nCooch takes a careful step behind Jimmy and cuffs him. Looks Twice speaks to the others in LAKOTA, and they disband, heading to a shade arbor where their clothes hang. \nAs Cooch starts marching Looks Twice toward the house, Ray keeps an eye on the departing. One of them stops halfway to the fence and turns. Grandpa Reaches looks at Ray with eyes that have seen one hundred and one hard years in Indian Country. \nRAY Go ahead. You can all go home. \nAnd he follows Cooch and the cuffed Jimmy to the house. \nCOOCH We just wanna take a look around your place, Jimmy. We're not here to bust your balls. \nAT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE \nCooch leads the half-naked suspect to the backdoor. Cooch show: a warrant, tries the door but it is locked. \nLOOKS TWICE What's this about? \nCOOCH Your good friend Leo Fast Elk. \nLOOKS TWICE You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man -- \nCOOCH -- don't \"man\" me, Jimmy. Where's the key? \nJimmy doesn't answer. He glares with hatred into Cooch's eyes. \nCOOCH Ray, use the federal master key. \nRay steps up, gets ready to throw a frontkick at the door. \nLOOKS TWICE No. Don't do that. Don't deface the property, man. The key's in there. \nWith his hands cuffed, he can only jerk his head toward a big hole in the wall down near the foundation. Cooch quickly drops to a knee and checks out the hole. \nLOOKS TWICE Inside... in the coffee can. \nCooch reaches in, probes. \nCOOCH There's no coffee can in -- \nSomething horrifying happens so fast, Cooch has no time to react. \nWhatever has taken his arm has done so with such force, his body jolts like he's touched raw voltage. The South Dakota BADGER rips through his leather jacket -- we get a glimpse of its striped face and yellowed teeth -- through his shirt. Through flesh, and deeper, GROWLING insanely while COOCH HOLLERS in shock tries to pull free and -- \nJimmy Looks Twice spins from the porch with a skillfully executed back kick, knocking Ray off the step and to the ground. The Indian bolts like a deer into the darkness. \nRay rolls in the grass, throwing his M-16 up. He hesitates. But only for a moment before FIRING and decimating the corner gutter, a junked car, several trees. But no sign of Jimmy. \nCooch falls back in the grass badly mauled. His arm has been ripped open down to the bone. \nCOOCH Jesus... Jesus... \nRay starts toward Cooch. \nCOOCH Get him... \nRay takes off, crashing through weeds, into a stream, wading through mud. He throws his flashlight left and right. He crosses the river, shines the light in a field of wild sage. Nothing. He runs like a sprinter, looking everywhere. But as he enters an -- \nOPEN FIELD \nall he finds is Jimmy's towel. He picks it up and looks around the area, breathing heavily. \nAnd then suddenly, something leaps up out of the grass. Ray swings his M-16 up, ready to blast. But it is a DEER, taking off into a mystical blue night. THE DRUM. Beating fast. Heavy. \nTURTLESHELL RATTLE. EAGLE BONE WHISTLES. \nIN THE YARD \nCooch traps his bleeding arm between his knees to stanch the blood. He speaks quietly but firm into his radio, trying to stay in control. \nCROW HORSE He says there's something wrong with Big Bird -- he's crazy, (stops laughing) He says you stopped the Inipi ceremony last night...? \nCrow Horse turns a questioning look at Ray. Ray doesn't flinch. \nCROW HORSE But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you. \nRAY He knows me? \nCROW HORSE He says he saw you in a vision some time ago. \nCrow Horse stops translating suddenly even though the old man continues speaking. Crow Horse looks concerned, and ASKS A QUESTION IN LAKOTA. We don't know what he's asking but the tone is absolute amazement. \nThis question triggers an exchange between he and Grandpa, the old one getting angry. Grandpa wins. \nCROW HORSE I guess he had this vision some time ago, in the Moon of the Popping Trees -- uh, back in the winter. He says you come from Wasi'cu city in the East but that your people... way back... are of the Minniconjou Sioux. But you yourself don't know that. \nRay's brow is drawn tense as he stares at the old Indian, absorbing the translation. Grandpa speaks more fervently now, incorporating Indian sign. Each time Grandpa does the hard Sioux HAND SLAP, Ray blinks. \nCROW HORSE He says he knew you'd be coming to Bear Creek. He was told. It is the will of Tunkasilia -- the grandfather that you come here. He says let's smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe, symbol of truth. So that there will be no lies between us. \nThe old man has taken a long wooden stem and a red stone bowl from a beaded pipe bag. He joins the two together then begins offering a pinch of tobacco to the Four Directions. While this goes on, Ray fidgets. \nRAY What's he smoke in that? \nCROW HORSE Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament. \nThe old man is offering the pipe to Ray. \nGRANDPA Mltaku Oyasin. \nRay looks at Grandpa. The old man offers the pipe again. \nCROW HORSE You don't smoke with him, it means you're hiding something. \nRay takes the pipe, looks at it... then passes it to Crow Horse. The big Indian takes it from Ray, giving him a long eye, then offering the pipe to The Directions before smoking. \nCrow Horse puffs hard, eyes closed, then slowly releases some smoke upward. Ray watches it climb and fade. The old man then takes up an old turtle shell rattle. He speaks. \nCROW HORSE He says Wakan. Sacred. Five hundred year old turtleshell rattle, passed down from the Grandfathers. Heavy duty. \nHe shakes the rattle very slightly, moving it in front of Ray. He speaks just above a whisper. \nCROW HORSE He says, it is good. The Spirits are here. The Spirits want to know what you're doing here? \nRay smirks. \nRAY Tell him I'm trying to find the man who murdered Leo Fast Elk. Ask him if he knows where he is. \nCrow Horse asks the old man in Lakota. No answer. The pipe is back to grandpa, and he offers it to the Directions, to the Earth then upward before smoking himself. He begins to speak again. \nPassionately. In long glottal Sioux sentences, adding sign, fingers crossing, brushing an arm, a slap here and there, \nHe is working himself into an excited state, and Ray keeps looking at Crow Horse, very interested in the old man's answer. \nFinally Grandpa's breath comes up short and wheezing, he ends his oratory with a solid hand slap. \nRAY What did he say? \nCROW HORSE He said he doesn't know. \nRAY He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say? \nCrow Horse ignores him. Grandpa speaks again. More hand language. \nThe old man is staring at Ray while whispering to Crow Horse. He strokes his badger claw necklace. \nCrow Horse looks at Ray and seems hesitant to translate this new piece of information. \nCROW HORSE Uh... Grandpa likes to trade; no one stops by here without gettin' stuck in the old Indian barter. He, uh... he likes your shades. \nGrandpa smiles toothlessly. Ray who has his driving glasses in hand, lifts them to say \"these?\" but Grandpa sees it as an accepted deal, and swiftly removes his necklace. He holds it out. \nRay slowly, hesitantly surrenders his sunglasses, and takes the necklace. Crow Horse bursts into laughter and so does Grandpa, enjoying a good trade. He draws a hand through the air in a sort of horizontal karate chop, meaning done deal. Ray looks confused. Out of his element. And out of his shades. \nAnother fly gets snagged on sticky tape. \nEXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER \nCrow Horse is hurrying toward his bike, Ray with him. \nRAY What was he saying? \nCROW HORSE Why should I tell you. \nRAY Because he was talking to me. \nSHERMAN Anderson Chasing Hawk. Second in command behind Jimmy. \nAT THE CROW'S NEST \nChasing Hawk hands the mic over to another Warrior. MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR would be the most beautiful woman Ray has even seen if she was not the meanest-looking. Her thick black hair falls over a denim jacket down below her horse-hair belt. Her faded jeans are stuffed into worn cowboy boots. And she is full of fire. She begins speaking in LAKOTA. Fluently. And with hand sign, like the old man. \nOUTSIDE THE ARBOR \nthe agents stand. Cooch is writing into a small notebook. \nSHERMAN Magedelana Eagle Bear. Eagle's claws and a bear's balls. \nMILES She keeps an AR-15 assault rifle in her truck. And she'll use it. \nAs Ray watches her, someone approaches in a less hostile manner. It is President Clear Moon, looking very upset. He holds the hand of a LITTLE GIRL, dressed in traditional dancing garb. \nHe approaches Ray. \nRAY Mr. Clear Moon. \nCLEAR MOON Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here. \nClear Moon gestures for the little girl to run off. He leans in close to Ray. \nCLEAR MOON They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people. \nRAY They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation. \nClear Moon is looking past Ray at the Warriors. They are approaching the agents, and Clear Moon looks at Ray with great concern. \nCLEAR MOON Help us. \nAnd he slowly retreats to his lawn chair under the arbor. \nChasing Hawk, Maggie and the other Warriors strut up to the agents. All but one who is bound to a wheelchair. We've seen RICHARD YELLOW BIRD, the big Cheyenne who wears a Red Power baseball cap, an earring, and thick bifocals -- in one of the file photos. His arms are plastered with tattoos. \nAGENT SHERMAN Where's Jimmy? We thought he'd be dancing today. \nThe warriors make a show of not acknowledging the FBI presence. They have walked over here just to walk by them. That is there statement. But Yellow Bird stops cranking the wheels of his chair and stop: long enough to look up at Ray. \nYELLOW BIRD Are you the Washington Redskin? \nEven the agents crack grins at this bit of Indian wit. All but Ray who just stands there, arms folded across his chest, considering the crippled activist. \nAGENT MILES Say hello to Richard Yellow Bird, Ray. \nYellow Bird sits there, staring up at him through thick glasses But then Maggie Eagle Bear takes the handles of Yellow Bird's wheel chair. She looks at Ray with eyes that are choke- cherry black, eyes that look right through him. He returns the glare. And then she pushes Yellowbird forward and leaves the feds alone. \nRay turns to Cooch who is lighting a cigarette, and concentrating on the movements of this group as they wander under the arbor, visiting people. LAKOTA SINGERS start up. \nCOOCH Ray, get to Jimmy's place and keep it tight. I'm gonna get a tail on his Warriors. \nIN THE POWWOW CENTER \nthe under ten year-old \"fancy dance\" -- TWENTY-FIVE INDIAN CHILDREN, whirling and stomping and dancing. \nJIMMY LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe battered old house sits under a full moon. The upside down flag moves slightly in the cross winds. \nACROSS THE ROAD \nseveral junked cars. Among them a black, rusted out VW van with a smashed windshield. A PACK OF RES DOGS sniff at its tires. \nINT. JIMMY'S VAN \nIn the dim light, a boot. A black cowboy boot. Up on the dash. Bluejeans. T-shirt. Second hand leather. And a black cowboy hat. Ray is staking out Jimmy's house. \nAcross the passenger seat and console is an M-16 rifle. On his belt, a .357 Red Hawk. He yawns. From outside, he hears a sound. \nPOV: down below the van, a small, patchy RES DOG with a missing leg is looking up at him with his tongue long and salivating. \nRAY breaks off a piece of sandwich and drops it down to him just as -- HEADLIGHTS catch his face. He slides down low, watching an old pick-up truck creak onto the dirt road, leading to Jimmy's. \nPOV: the truck parks. Someone jumps out, gracefully. Indian. Long braid. Quick steps. Front door. Inside. \nRAY lifts his radio. \nRAY X22. Read. \nRADIO Go ahead, Ray. \nRAY I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over. \nRADIO Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over. \nAGENT SHERMAN What do we got, Ray? \nRAY It was just Eagle Bear. I questioned and released her. \nCOOCH What'd she say? \nRAY She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. \"What's the FBI really doing here.\" Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty. \nCooch nods. The agents form a tight unit out below the upside down flag. \nRAY She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's. \nCOOCH Let's see it. \nRAY I gave it back to her. \nAGENT SHERMAN Why? \nRAY If it is Jimmy's, she's taking it to him. We'll have a runner. But I borrowed a little mojo... \nRay reaches inside his pant leg, down around his boot and carefully removes a white eagle feather. He gingerly tucks it in a plastic bag. \nCOOCH Way to go, Raymond. Miles, take that to lab. Sherman, I want you to go back to base and produce some written material. Something that indicates that our girl Maggie is leaking information to us. And make sure that material finds its way into the hands of the Warrior Movement. \nSherman and Miles, take off. Cooch, an impressive master of COINTELPRO, now turns to the van squad. \nCOOCH You gentlemen missed that medicine basket. Go back through the house, and make sure you missed nothing else. And lay some wire, too. Let's do it. \nThe van squad moves toward the house, leaving Cooch and Ray alone in the highbeams that light the yard. \nCOOCH That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver. \nRAY Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant? \nCOOCH Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support. \nRay nods, impressed. \nCooch bends down near the road, touches the dirt. \nCOOCH Her oil pan is shot. \nRAY Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty? \nCOOCH Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian. \nCooch wipes the oil on a handkerchief as he rises, smiling playfully at Ray. He starts back toward his car. Some sort of bird is COOING in the night. \nCOOCH Get a tail on her, Ray. \nRay looks up at the upside down flag. Then watches Cooch walking way. \nRAY Cooch. (a quiet, tired laugh) Where the fuck did they send us? \nCOOCH A long way from home. You be careful out there. \nCooch, standing there with his glasses on and his right arm bandaged, looks tired, too. He gets in his car. \nIn the yard, Ray starts for the van, the res dog, trying to follow. He chases it away. And then as he gets closer to the van, he looks up to investigate the COOING SOUND. \nAT THE TOP OF THE FLAG POLE \nthere is a shadow. What looks to be a large bird. It just hovers. In the shadows. \nDOWN BELOW \nRay looks up at the pole, watching. Then walking on. \nEXT. BEAR CREEK RES - SUNRISE \nMind-blowing sunrise of airbrush red. Clusters of lodge-pole pine. The spectacular mesa. PAINT HORSES graze in a field, a few out in the center of the road. \nAT GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER \nthe old man comes down the front steps in a frail walk, carrying a paper plate. He steps down into the sage clusters that grow just off his trailer, and offers the plate up toward the sky. \nHe then stoops, and scrapes a half-eaten English muffin, some potato chips and half a banana onto the Earth in a neat pile. \nHe straightens his back the best he can, looks up again, and prays softly. \nTHE BADLANDS \npossess an otherworldly beauty at this magic hour, a maze of shadows and rainbows. In the distance we cannot mistake the frame of Walter Crow Horse. He's out there, long hair blowing against the white bluffs. Stalking. Tracking. \nON THE VILLAGE ROAD \nRay looks at Crow Horse, sees that he's serious, and follows him toward his motorcycle. \nRAY Alright, Crow Horse. I'm listening. I'm listening to the trees, to the stones. Who is it? \nCrow Horse turns toward Ray, and creates a long dramatic pause. \nCROW HORSE Damned if I know. \nAnd he hauls his bulk onto his motorbike. \nCROW HORSE But the Old One. He did a Yuwipi ceremony last night. \nCrow Horse winks at Ray as he slams the kickstart. To no avail. \nRAY The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo? \nCROW HORSE Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late. \nRAY Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing. \nCROW HORSE Grandpa traded with me. (flips the bird) Goodbye. \nAnd Crow Horse nails his kick start. The BIKE ROARS alive and the Indian works the throttle hard, leaving gravel and black exhaust. Ray stands there, drifting between logic and instinct. He looks at his watch, then starts at a slow, thoughtful shuffle toward his car. \nEXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER \nThe dust-buzzard broncs and bounces down Grandpa's driveway, coming to a stop near the wrecked cars. Crow Horse dismounts and unhooks a carton of smokes from the back. \nA moment later, the junker van pulls in, bouncing and shaking. \nCrow Horse stares at the approaching vehicle, his eyes hidden behind Ray's former shades. He cracks a slow smile because -- \nRay is stepping quickly from the van, and carrying two packs of Marlboros. \nINT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER \nGrandpa sits in his chair, his black eyes moving smoothly from side to side. Smoke enshrouds his ancient face, giving the sense of another time and place. He speaks LAKOTA. \nCrow Horse, sitting on a stool across from him, holds The Pipe. He passes it to Ray who sits in a busted lawn chair next to him. The room is dark as the sun sets out the window in red and purple. Ray looks at the pipe. Grandpa will not speak until Ray smokes. And so he does, drawing on the stem, awkwardly. \nHEARTBEAT DRUM as Grandpa speaks Indian. \nCROW HORSE He says, back behind Red Deer Table, where the Elk-People-used-to-live... there are strange creatures from another world who eat stones... and who will kill anyone who crosses into this place. \nRay looks at Crow Horse, searching for a hint of lightness. But there is only great reverence as he watches Ray blow smoke upward. \nCROW HORSE He says, in the Yuwipi ceremony last night, he saw you... going back into the land beyond Red Deer Table. I was with you. But that was all the Spirits let him see so he doesn't know if you were killed or not. But he thinks you probably were. \nRay smirks as he passes the pipe to Grandpa. Crow Horse looks nervous. Grandpa offers the pipe to the directions and then disengages the bowl from the stem. He speaks again. Crow Horse translates. \nCROW HORSE Go to the land where the Elk-People- used-to-live and you will find the answers you came here looking for. But you must go as two. That is the vision. I have spoken. And this is so. \nGrandpa leans closer to Crow Horse and whispers some Lakota. \nCROW HORSE He wants to trade. (a beat) He likes your watch. \nRay looks at Crow Horse, nervous. \nRAY I can't do that, (explaining) It's a Rolex. \nCROW HORSE A what? \nAnd Grandpa is already holding out something to offer. It is a cigarette. Grandpa offers it again. \nRAY I'm sorry, this is -- (loud to Grandpa) -- this is very, very expensive. It's -- (to Crow Horse) Tell him this is an expensive watch. \nCrow Horse tells the Old Man. Grandpa speaks Indian. \nCROW HORSE He says, you need to go on Indian time. He says your watch is ruining your life anyway. \nRay buries his hands in his jacket pocket. No way. Crow Horse signs to Grandpa \"no.\" Grandpa gets up, crosses between the two young men, up to the TV set. He turns it on. \nWHEEL OF FORTUNE \nexplodes in PINGS AND PONGS and a WOMAN'S SHRILL SCREAM. \nEXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER - DAY \nCrow Horse and Ray walk down the steps. WHEEL OF FORTUNE is heard from within. \nCROW HORSE Red Deer Table, Ray. \nRAY Don't tell me: heavy duty. \nCROW HORSE Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision. \nA flat-bed tow truck drives past the motel with the killer's car on it. Behind the truck is a fed car which stops at the motel, and the Le Baron which also pulls in. Miles and Sherman get out from the first car, Ray and Cooch bail from the Le Baron. \nWith RADIOS TRANSMITTING, the agents walk, dusty and tired, into room 14. Ray hesitates, snagged by the sight of -- \nA motorcycle parked in front of the Buffalo Butte Bar. Parked with pick-up trucks and station wagons. It's the mud-caked old Barley. Parked right under the NO INDIANS sign. \nHe puzzles over this. \nINT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - DAY \nDark. Even during the day. Cigarette smoke. Sawdust. On the archaic juke box, RANDY TRAVIS sings \"Old 8x10\" while behind the bar, the BAR OWNER, an old man with long white hair and beard, busies himself with leather work. SEVERAL WHITE LOCALS sit on the old water drum bar stools. \nHeads lift, turn when Ray enters in his \"fraternizing\" clothes -- jeans and boots, leather jacket. He scuffs up thick sawdust as he heads to the furthest booth back where -- \nCrow Horse sits, alone over a bourbon and a beer. Ray approaches carefully, upset by the sight. He slides into the booth and point blanks the Indian. \nCROW HORSE Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination. \nRAY Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing? \nCROW HORSE You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered. \nRAY Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man. \nCROW HORSE Cuz I'm a skin? \nRAY Cuz you're a cop. \nCROW HORSE Not no more. \nRAY What are you talking about? \nCROW HORSE You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case. \nRAY And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you. \nCrow Horse shimmers his black eyes onto Ray. \nCROW HORSE Still after Jimmy? \nRAY They found prints at Blue Legs' place. \nCROW HORSE Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow? \nRay just looks vacantly at Crow Horse. Crow Horse resents the vacancy. \nCROW HORSE Look, man... you better bust Jimmy and get out before somebody shoots up more than your car next time. \nRay glares at him. \nRAY Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is. \nCROW HORSE I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's. \nRay doesn't blink. \nCROW HORSE You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop? \nRAY No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop. \nCrow Horse leans toward Ray and speaks more quietly. \nCROW HORSE You ever think that maybe you was sent here cuz the FBI's need one good reason to take out the entire Warrior Movement. And what better reason than one of their men, gettin' blown away on the res. A low-rent, expendable public servant sent in to take a bullet for his country. \nRay is fuming. He can't believe what he's hearing, what's being insinuated, but he's giving it thought and it's getting him angry. He smashes a hand down on the table. \nRAY I'm sick of your shit -- \nRANCHER (O.S.) I'm sick of the two of ya timber niggers spewin' off. \nStanding over the booth is a long, tall RANCHER'S SON. Rangey with red curly hair tucked under a BLACK HILLS CLASSIC cap, and arms built by tractor work. And behind him, TWO OLDER RANCHERS fall in. And ANOTHER YOUNG MAN, grinning with amusement. \nRay and Crow Horse look up. \nCROW HORSE Sorry, we don't speak United States. \nRANCHER'S SON Yeah, well I do. Get the Jesus up, and get the Jesus out or I'm gonna go out to my truck and come back with my hardware. \nRAY Woh, hold on there, Jack, you're -- \nRANCHER'S SON -- don't \"jack\" me, Squanto. I'll bury your lazy ass right here. \nRay realizes now that they think he's Indian, too. Crow Horse sees this revelation and complicates it by suddenly speaking LAKOTA to Ray. \nThe rancher grabs Ray by the cheeks. \nREVERSE - MAGGIE \nkeeping her eyes on the Wasi'cu, but addressing Yellow Bird. \nMAGGIE Richard. Sing the Honoring Song with them. I'll be right back. \nON THE HILL \nRay stands, watching Maggie walking into the wind, toward him. Behind her an HONORING SONG, sung by ten children haunts the still air. \nHe doesn't budge as she mounts the gentle bluff and joins him there. \nMAGGIE We're praying at the grave. Do you wanna join us? \nA long silence. The voices carry in the wind. \nRAY No, Maggie. But you're gonna have to join me for a ride. I'm taking you to Rapid City. \nMaggie looks at him. They lock eyes. \nMAGGIE So much power. I see it in your eyes. This... hunger for power. Or for what you think is power. \nAs if exhausted by the thought, Maggie sits down on the bluff, looking out at the children who are still singing the song. As she speaks, she begins digging her fingers in the earth. Ray stands over her. \nRAY You burned an American flag today. And left it for me... \nMAGGIE -- You desecrated it, it had to be burned. \nRAY I desecrated it? \nMAGGIE You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place. (a beat) In your eyes, that's power. \nMaggie lifts herself onto her knees and looks down into the small hole she's dug. She picks up a little pine cone. \nMAGGIE So I plant this tree for you. And I take all this stuff that you've laid on me and my people, and I put it in this hole with this pine cone. (she covers it) And I bury it. Cuz ya know what it is, Ray? Bullshit. And shit is fertilizer. (she stands) And The Mother will turn your lies into something that lives. \nMaggie rises, dusting off her hands. She looks him in the soul. \nMAGGIE That's what power is, in the Indian way. (holds her hands out to be cuffed) Take me to Rapid, Ray. I'm the enemy. \nRay just stares at her, struggling with what he's feeling, what he's hearing. What he's supposed to be feeling. Silence hangs between the two of them. \nRAY If I told you... that I think Jimmy's innocent... but I'm in over my head... would you believe me? \nMaggie looks at him, considering. Then toward the long dark silhouette of a mountain range across the plains. \nMAGGIE See those Black Hills out there, Ray? When the people lost the land in 1868, the government took everything but those hills. They allowed us to keep those Black Hills, to live there. Signed a treaty. Until they found gold. Then they told us we had to leave because of National interest. They broke that treaty. Anyone who fought or spoke out against it, wound up dead or in jail. And the people wound up here. On a reservation. \nWhile she looks off at Paha Sapa, Ray stares at her profile. \nMAGGIE While up there, in the Black Hills... they carved the faces of four presidents. \nShe looks at Ray with an ironic smile, and she catches him transfixed. \nMAGGIE Your relatives must've taught you something. \nRAY NO. (after thought) My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy. \nMaggie starts giggling. \nRAY What? \nMAGGIE Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy. \nRAY Great. \nMaggie is laughing as she looks back at the children who are no longer singing. Ray reaches inside his jacket and takes out five polaroids. He shuffles them as he ponders. He hands one to Maggie who has caught herself opening up too much to the Wasi'cu. \nRAY You ever see that car before? \nMaggie looks at the first photo and says nothing. She hands it back quickly. Ray won't take it. \nRAY Who's it belong to? \nMaggie ignores him. Ray studies her reaction. \nRAY Help me, Maggie... \nMaggie is looking away. She picks a long blade of grass and smoothes it in her hands. \nRay looks at her a moment longer then rises, dusting off his jeans, and standing there. He thinks for a long moment, pinches the bridge of his nose, then looks out at the Black Hills, pensive. \nRAY I didn't see you today, Maggie. (a beat) Goodbye. \nMaggie watches him go. Looks away. Then watches him again. \nWith RADIO TRANSMISSIONS crackling through the house, Cooch comes back down the hall, and heads to the door. \nCOOCH Trailer's clean, let's go. \nRay starts to follow but he sees Sherman pick something up from near Grandpa. The 500 year-old turtleshell rattle. Grandpa's eyes widen slightly. \nSHERMAN You been the one making it rain like that, out there, Sam? \nRAY Hey, put that down. \nSHERMAN Can you make Jimmy outrun an M-16, Sam? \nRAY Sherman! \nSherman drops the turtleshell rattle on the linoleum floor. Then drives his heel into it, CRUSHING the fragile turtleshell. \nRay grabs him and slams him into the tin wall. Miles gets between them, grabbing Sherman. \nMILES EASY, MEN! HEY! -- \nRADIO HE'S ON THE ROOF! HE'S ON THE FUCKING ROOF! COME ON GUYS, COME ON, GUYS! \nThey're out the door, leaving the old man to sit looking down at the shattered rattle. He closes his eyes. \nEXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER \nIn a blizzard of rain, Jimmy Looks Twice in a cowboy shirt, jeans and boots, leaps off the top of the Airstream, clutching his medicine bundle. FLOODLIGHTS HIT him from all directions. BULLHORNS screaming at him. \nHe tries to turn a corner and runs right into a fed. Ray, having run out the back door has slammed right into him. He has his rifle on him, and they stare each other down for a split second before he is converged on. Guns at his back, at his head. \nHe is swept off his feet, face down, and frisked. He looks up at Ray, desperately. \nLOOKS TWICE Brother, the old man told me about you. Listen to me: what was Leo trying to tell me? He wanted to meet me at Maisy -- \nAnother fed, pushes his face into the mud, cuffs him behind his back. \nFED Save your speeches for prison, Jimmy. \nWith two FIVE MAN SWAT TEAMS swarming the area, and six agents pushing Jimmy toward a car, Cooch stands there in the pouring rain, looking relieved. Ray stands near him, looking abhorred. \nCOOCH Damn. That's one hard running Indian. \nRay watches Jimmy as he is shoved into the back of Miles and Sherman's car and driven away. He is twisting around in his seat to look at Ray. Desperately. The SWAT teams disband, return to their vehicles. \nCOOCH It's over, Ray. I aged five years. But it's over. At least I'm gonna look like I'm ready for the advisory desk. Let's go get a beer. \nCooch heads to his car and Ray starts shuffling toward his as if he is dared by it all. He is looking at the trailer and there on the rickety porch is Grandpa. He comes down the steps slowly, holding his hat on against the wind. He watches the cars pulling out. \nRay walks over to him, looking sick. \nRAY Look... I'm not who you think I am. (a long beat) I'm sorry. \nAnd after a moment of locking gazes, he starts for his car, \nGRANDPA Out back that way... is a placed called Wounded Knee. \nRay turns. \nGRANDPA I was one years old there when our people were shot down. My mother hid me in the snow in a blanket. One of those killed was a Holy Man called Wakiyan Cante -- Thunder Heart. They killed him while he was running for The Stronghold. It is his blood -- the same blood that spilled on the grass and snow at Wounded Knee -- that runs through your heart like a buffalo. \nRay frowns, disturbed by this story. \nThe old man is speaking with conviction. With power. \nGRANDPA Thunder Heart has come. Sent here to a troubled place to help his people. That's what I am told. Maybe you're right and I am mistaken. Your mind is young, mine is old. If so, so be it. Ho Hecetu Yelo. I'll speak no more. \nRay stands, almost paralyzed, digesting this. He turns and looks into the old man's sharp eyes. Grandpa has closed his eyes, and as he is pulverized by the rain, he turns his face toward it and from way down in his belly, he begins to SING IN LAKOTA. And it is too much. Too weird. He wheels and hurries to the car. Gets in, and beats a fast path out of the old man's lonesome patch of land. \nBLUE HEAT LIGHTNING knifes the sky. THUNDER ROLLS, and rumbles into POOL BALLS -- \nEXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL AND BAR - LATE DAY \nThe agents have taken over both sides of the streets, gathered in front of the bar and the motel, putting firearms into cases, removing flak jackets. \nPOOL BALLS knock from inside the bar while outside, A DAKOTAN takes a piss near a truck while his GIRLFRIEND stands at his back, yelling at him. CHARLIE DANIELS sings country on the juke Ray heads to room 13, starts unlocking the door. Cooch comes up behind him. \nCOOCH Buffalo burgers and cold beer, Raymond. Don't worry about the sign out front... you don't have to be Indian anymore. \nCooch throws a mock punch at Ray and he mock blocks, tired. He musters a smile. But he isn't all there. \nCOOCH You have a fever. You okay? \nRay nods. Cooch lets a few agents walk past, LAUGHING. He speaks quietly. \nCOOCH Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta. \nRay sits in a busted chair, reaches down to his ankle holster and pulls out a .38. He holds it, resting it on the arm of the chair. He strains to look out through the boarded window. Yellow Bird fidgets in his chair. \nRAY Get up out of the chair, Richard. \nYELLOW BIRD What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man. \nRAY Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard. \nYELLOW BIRD (not moving) I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you! \nRAY Get up! \nYellow Bird stands. He takes a step forward. Limping. He's got leg problems but he can walk. Heels first. And bowed. But he can walk. He is shaking. \nYELLOW BIRD They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right? \nRAY They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth. \nYELLOW BIRD (crying) What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do. \nRAY Leo Fast Elk... is alive. \nYellow Bird wheels. \nYELLOW BIRD No way. No fuckin' way. \nRAY How the hell do you know? \nYELLOW BIRD I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary? \nRay is trying hard not to reveal his horror at this confession, at this understanding of the machinery. He sits there with his gun, blinking away sweat that beads at his brow. Yellow Bird is weeping in a highpitched voice that doesn't match his great bulk. \nRAY The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them. \nYELLOW BIRD Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there? \nRAY You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows. \nYELLOW BIRD What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn. \nRAY Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?! \nYELLOW BIRD I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever. \nRAY What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English! \nYELLOW BIRD Red Deer Table! What's with you, man? \nRay grabs onto these words, rolls them silently on his lips And now Yellow Bird is getting suspicious of the fed. \nYELLOW BIRD Wait a minute. Wait -- what are you doin'? You ain't a FBI. You ain't the law. Let me see your -- \nRay snaps out his gun, straight-armed. \nRAY I'm the fucking law! \nYellow Bird jumps back, raising his hands. \nRAY Keep talking, Yellow Bird... \nYELLOW BIRD All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more. \nAnd then HEADLIGHTS pierce the gaps in the boarded windows. Yellow Bird collapses against the wall, bangs his head off it. He lets a long, pained, cry escape from under his breath and he begins a slow slide down the wall, to the floor. \nRay peers out the cracks in the boards. \nYELLOW BIRD Man, I don't know who the fuck I am no more. \nRay gets up, putting his gun away and heading to the door. He stops and looks back at the Indian, sitting on the floor, clutching his knees, staring into the kerosene flicker. \nRAY You and me both. \nYellow Bird looks at him, his glasses foggy, his face contorted And Ray leaves. \nEXT. YELLOW BIRD'S SHACK - NIGHT \nRay steps out into the falling night. There is a car parked there. With a high aerial. Ray raises a hand in a slight wave, walks on. At the fed car, A REGIONAL AGENT behind the wheel, waves a hand. Watches Ray get into the Le Baron. \nRay gets in the car and takes off. \nLE BARON - TRAVELING \nRay drives like a crazy man through the dark reservation. Through miles of open land and strange rock formations. And he looks trapped. HEADLIGHTS flicker in his rearview. He sees this. Slams the gas pedal. \nEXT. RES ROADS - NIGHT \nEXT. YELLOW BIRD'S SHACK - RES - DAWN \nThe shack is just as Ray left it earlier, kerosene flickers dancing yellow through the gapped boards. Ray and Crow Horse with guns drawn, approach the front door. \nCROW HORSE I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything. \nRAY He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight. \nCrow Horse snakes around toward the rear of the shack. \nRay knocks at the front door. It is unlatched and it creaks open a little. Ray pushes it open and sees -- \nINT. YELLOW BIRD SHACK \nAn empty wheelchair. \nEXT. YELLOW BIRD SHACK \nRay steps away from the door, looking around the vast plains as the sun comes up out of the Black Hills. He is roadblocked, and it shows in his eyes. It's all getting too big. \nCrow Horse leans against the shack, watching Ray. And then RADIO STATIC from inside the Le Baron. Ray pivots and stares at it as if someone is inside the car. His call signal is being paged. But he just stands there, looking at it. \nRADIO X21. Read. X21... \nRay reaches inside the car and lifts the handset. He takes a breath before pressing it to his lips. \nRAY X21. Come back. \nRADIO Ray. What's your 20? \nRay looks at Crow Horse who looks equally spooked. The agent clears his throat. \nRAY Reservation. \nA long, unnerving pause. No response from the other side. \nRADIO What are you doing on the reservation? \nRAY I'm on my way back in. Over. \nRay holds the handset down at his side, looking over the top of the car toward the Black Hills. \nCROW HORSE Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray... \nRAY You go to the council fire. I'm going back in. \nCROW HORSE Ray. \nRay swings in behind the wheel, starts the car, and barrels off recklessly down the rutted road, leaving Crow Horse behind. \nCROW HORSE Ray! \nThe Le Baron is already out to where sight reaches farther than sound and silent white dust mushrooms skyward. \nEXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - MORNING \nA RAVEN is sentinel on a telephone wire that crosses the road from the bar to motel. A few trucks remain parked in front of the joint. \nRay approaches room 13, looking shell-shocked. His boots leave blue mud prints all the way to the door. He unlocks it. \nINT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - ROOM \nRay has cast off his field clothes and is halfway into one of his cleaner suits. He looks haggard but still buoyant, his eyes piercing. The connecting door creaks open and Cooch walks in. The SAC is freshly showered and he is fidgeting with a Windsor knot. He studies his number two man, says nothing for a moment but is obviously holding something down. His face is a red hue. \nCOOCH (extra casual) Couldn't sleep, Ray? \nRay looks at Cooch. When he speaks, his voice is dry. \nRAY No... \nCooch crosses the room, and picks up Ray's jeans which look like they went through a sandlot tackle match in a mud hole. Ray tucks his clean shirt in; watching Cooch. \nRAY I had to finish something with Crow Horse. \nCooch walks up to Ray slowly and takes his face in his hand, turning it toward lamp light to study the bruise along his left eye, a residual from a Crow Horse hook. \nCOOCH That's where you were. You had to go back and have it out with the Indian law... \nRay nods, and Cooch slowly breaks a smile. An insecure smile but a smile just the same. He starts to laugh. \nCOOCH You fucking hot head, we can get in trouble for that. \nCooch laughs in amusement and Ray's face crinkles into a grin as he lowers his eyes, wiping a paper towel over his face. And then, suddenly, Ray lunges at Cooch. \nHe slams the Agent in Charge against the hollow wall, and holds him there. His eyes wild. \nAnd Cooch squeals out with a petrified Clear Moon in the backseat, inquiring nervously. \nEXT. ROAD TO GRANDPA REACHES \nCrow Horse passes by an abandoned horse trailer. When he does, another car pulls out. And follows. The first car passes by. \nCrow Horse sees he's being followed. He cranks his throttle and the engine grinds then dies. He heels his kickstart on the fly, and keeps it alive. But his old horse is no match for the big engines coming up fast behind him. \nINT. LE BARON - TRAVELING \nRay is leaving little transitional developments and trailers behind. His eyes bore into the road before him, looking for a sign of Crow Horse, and in the rearview for a sign of his FBI mentor. \nEXT. ROAD TO GRANDPA REACHES - BADLANDS \nCrow Horse has the throttle open. But the two cars are coming up on both sides, trying to sandwich him. To his right the Badlands loom deep, a drop into a caliche netherworld of jagged rock. \nHe throws the bike right, trying to ride the thin ribbon of shoulder. \nTHE FIRST CAR \nfloors it, and swipes him, and the bike goes over the edge, launched into -- \nTHE BADLANDS \nwhere it does a violent triple flip, throwing Crow Horse then smashing into a tent shaped dune. \nA RIFLE \nsticks out from a window and punches the Badlands with THREE SHOTS. \nEXT. ROAD TO GRANDPA REACHES \nThe Le Baron rifles past the abandoned horse trailer. Black smoke drifts in a wind ahead. \nRay veers onto the shoulder, barely gets the car in park before bailing and running wildly down into the Badlands. \nEXT. BADLANDS \nRay runs, stumbles through the rock and gypsum, searching the area. He runs around the burning motorcycle, looking left and right. \nRAY Crow Horse! \nCROW HORSE \nlies on his back in the Badlands, eyes open, fixed unmoving on the sky. Ray comes out of the flame-waves, running with his .45 held high. He throws himself to his knees beside the injured Indian. \nRAY Crow Horse! \nCrow Horse rolls his eyes toward the FBI agent. He has a gash behind his ear, and pink sand clings to the blood. He lifts his head, tries to form words. \nCROW HORSE Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon... \nRAY I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead. \nCROW HORSE Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die. \nRAY Bullshit, let's get outta here, \nRay gets an arm under the big Indian, helps him up out of a jagged crevice. \nCROW HORSE Grandpa... \nEXT. RESERVATION ROAD \nCooch's car speeds down the stretch. Followed by Sherman's. The FBI van. All at one-hundred and five. Gravel and dirt flies. \nINT. LE BARON - TRAVELING \nWith Crow Horse half-passed out in the passenger seat, Ray keeps the wheel steady. And then his RADIO STATICS. \nRADIO X21, please read. Ray. Ray. X21, please read. This is Cooch. Please come in, Ray. Where are you? \nRay just stares down at the radio, keeps the pedal floored. The throws the wheel left. \nEXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER \nThe Le Baron fish-tails in a cloud of dust and Ray leaps out of the car, runs toward the little trailer, gun in hand. The windows are all busted, and the door is wide open. Ray runs in. Then straight back out, shaking his head to Crow Horse. \nCrow Horse hangs his head out the passenger window. \nRAY He's gone. \nCROW HORSE He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him. \nRay starts to get back in then hesitates. He looks out across the plains to see -- \nAT THE EDGE OF THE ARROYO \nthe caravan slides in recklessly, two of the fed cars coming dangerously close to going over the edge. The regional officers and six Clear Moon goons empty out, running down the dip, rifles and shotguns ready. \nThree more field agents come down from another direction, followed by Cooch. Sherman hands a bullhorn to him. \nCOOCH (via bullhorn) FREEZE! NOW! \nThe sound of FIFTEEN PRIMING FIREARMS stops Ray and Crow Horse in their tracks. Just twenty feet from The Stronghold. Crow Horse, windless, stumbles to a knee. Ray turns slowly, facing the small army. \nCOOCH DROP IT. \nCrow Horse, rises, sucking wind, and ditches his gun in the Badlands. Ray holds onto his .45 a moment longer. Then drops it. He stares at -- \nTHE WALL OF MEN \nCooch, SA Miles, SA Sherman, Six regional officers, six Clear Moon goons. And now, coming out of the backseat of Cooch's Chevy, Oliver Clear Moon, walking tentatively, cautiously. \nCooch lowers the bullhorn. He takes the opportunity to stare at Ray. To let Ray stare at him. The older agent looks broken. \nCOOCH Crow Horse, get your face in the dirt. Ray... come forward. Let it go. Let's just let it go... \nAT THE STRONGHOLD ENTRANCE \nCrow Horse lowers himself to a knee then lies face down. Ray just stands there, the wind against him. \nCOOCH (O.S.) Come on, Ray. Come forward. \nRAY No way, Cooch. \nRay refuses to move. \nCOOCH \nsweating, tries to keep control. All around him, hands are on guns. Cooch is walking toward Ray. \nCOOCH Ray. I'm coming to talk to you. I'm gonna walk you out of here. And we're gonna get the hell outta this place. \nCooch walks toward him, a gun hanging at one side, bullhorn at the other. The agents behind him, around him, all raise rifles, all take aim. \nSherman, looking sick, gets to a knee and sets aim. The sound of clacking steel, all around. But Cooch seems disturbed by the sound. Because its coming from above. He raises an eye from the rifle sight to see -- \nALONG THE EDGE OF THE BUTTE \nFIFTEEN INDIANS, training rifles and shotguns down below. \nSHERMAN \nlooks up from his rifle, bewildered. Then alarmed. \nALONG THE EDGE OF THE BUTTE \nWe PAN across fifteen Indians -- old people, women, kids. Their weapons are weak but many. \nAnd at the end of the row, Maisy Blue Legs rises, clutching a rifle. And PAST HER, ANOTHER. TRADITIONAL PEOPLE, many from the trading post porch, rise to the edge, armed. Silent. \nTwenty, twenty-five, thirty traditionals, forming a line along the ridge, a line that runs in a circle, broken by the Stronghold entrance, then starting again on the next butte. Thirty-five, forty of them. And more, standing along the opposite craggy rock, some wearing tractor caps, some cowboy hats, some just long hair blowing in the wind. Fifty, sixty, SEVENTY-FIVE RESERVATION PEOPLE forming a circle on the rocks; it's Little Big Horn revisited. A fourteen year-old boy struggles to keep a huge shotgun at his shoulder. \nDOWN BELOW \nClear Moon's mouth is as dry as Badlands soil. Cooch is panicking, his eyes running along the high edge. \nRAY \nstands equally astonished, assessing the back-up. \nCROW HORSE \nlifts himself, stands, taking in the sight. \nAT THE EDGE OF THE BUTTE \nstepping stiffly but steadily through the line of armed locals, pushing his way to the very edge so as to look down, Grandpa Sam Reaches. The wind makes feathery tails out of his long thinning strips of white hair. \nDOWN BELOW \nRay looks up at the old man, then turns to face Cooch. \nRAY You're right, Cooch. It's over. \nCooch slowly, lets the bullhorn fall. Then the rifle. He looks back at Sherman who does the same, and all the way down the line, everyone dropping their arms under the threat of a lot more guns from above. And now Ray walks forward, collecting his gun. Anderson Chasing Hawk, one of the Warriors, runs down to Ray, breathless. \nCHASING HAWK All the exits are blocked. There's two more fed cars tryin' to get in. And some press. \nRay notices that Cooch is staring at him, hard. He shakes his head slowly. Strongly. \n", "test1_input": "COOCH The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here? \nCooch laughs good-naturedly. Ray smiles. But Brooks looks offended. \nBROOKS That set-to you saw out front, was nothin' more than a message we were sendin' to the sonsabitches that are divertin' water from the river. \nDENNIS We got rights. We got a ranch just up here. \nRay catches this. Glances a look off Cooch who works on a cold draught beer. \nRAY Did any of you gentlemen know Leo Fast Elk? \nBoth men shake their heads. Get quiet. \nBROOKS You fellas are here to investigate a Indian crime, you should keep to Indian land, and talk to them, not us. But you wanna drink here and shoot stick here, that's your right, and we respect that. (to Dennis) Come on, Son, we're up on the table. \nDENNIS You fellas wanna play doubles? \nCooch shakes his head, distracted, and the two locals leave, enroute for the pool table. Ray watches them go, curious. \nEXT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - NIGHT \nRay and Cooch, cross the street back to the motel. It is black and chillingly still. \nRAY Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think. \nCOOCH Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars. \nRAY I already did. \nCooch looks at Ray, impressed. \nRAY Couldn't sleep. \nCOOCH Good. \nThey stop in front of their rooms and Cooch pulls a small tape recorder from his waistband. A micro-cassette recorder that he examines in the dim door light. \nRECORDER (locals) -- out here we got our Indians. And that's the way it is. \nCooch shuts it off. \nCOOCH By the time you get to the main village, sun'll be up. I want you to fraternize. Socialize. Penetrate. Infiltrate. Eat some raw kidney, and get these Indians talking. I'm gonna Powwow with Big Chief Clear Moon and find out more about Leo. \nHe hands Ray the recorder. \nRAY Done. \nCooch starts for his room but in a long, exaggerated country step as he breaks into the HANK WILLIAMS tune that has all but driven him insane inside the joint. Ray watches him go, and cracks a laugh. \nINT. LE BARON - TRAVELING - SUNRISE \nRay's at the wheel, looks intense as he studies the vast expanse of slopes and rock formations and the rising sphere of flame that lights the road in strange color. He is reading a name list that he traps against the wheel. \nRAY Hobert Standing-Buffalo-That-Walks- Dreamer. (a dry run) Hello, I'm looking for Hobert Standing- Buffalo-That-Walks... Dreamer. \nRay pulls up a long dirt drive and parks. \nEXT. OLD TRAILER - ACROSS FROM BADLANDS \u0096 SUNRISE \nRay walks to the front door of a war-torn trailer that is halfway swallowed by weeds and plants. It is static out here. Dead still. Ray approaches the front door. There is a huge hole in it. He knocks above the hole. \nAfter a moment, the door opens a crack. A dark, weather-beaten face barely shows. \nRAY Good morning. I'm looking for Hobert- Buffalo-Dreaming... (cheat sheet) Hobert Standing-Buffalo-That-Walks-- \nThe door closes. Locks. \nRAY --Dreamer. \nRay stands there for a moment then lowers himself to look through the huge hole in the door. \nRAY Sir? \nA tattered chair is pushed against the door, covering the hole. Ray stands up, turns on the steps. And before he can let out a flustered sigh, he spots something across the dirt road. Something that makes him remove his shades, look again. Whatever it is, it doesn't make him happy, and he is hurrying across the road. \nEXT. BADLANDS - DAY \nA motorcycle, parked between the road and the badlands. We've seen the ancient bike before. Ray walks past it, looking at it. \nHe pushes his shades up on the bridge of his nose and looks down into the moonscape. \nWalter Crow Horse is down there, on his haunches, \"feel tracking\", laying his fingers inside tracks and reading them. He doesn't even look up at the sound of the FBI agent's footsteps. \nCROW HORSE Ray Little Weasel. FBI. I like the way ya sneaked up on me. Must be Indian. \n", "test1_true": "RAY What are you -- \nCROW HORSE Watch out! \nRay draws back. \nRAY What?! \nCROW HORSE You're steppin' on sign. \nCrow Horse lowers his face to the ground and blows some scattered dust out of a print. Lightly lays his fingers inside \nRAY Hey. (ignored) Hey, you, listen up -- \nCROW HORSE -- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire. \nCrow Horse checks out another track. \nCROW HORSE The man you want... stepped outta the car, dragged Leo out, laid him down. Then walked over here and made a circle in the earth with a stick. I can't find the stick. He stuck an eagle plume in the circle, got back in his car, dustin' his own prints with a pine bough for about six feet, but he missed a print, right here, see. He got in his car and went Hell- bent-for-Holy-Sunday outta here. He ditched that pine bough three miles across the flat, in the Little Bear River, it floated down to Thundershield Gap. The car hit paved road, and was outta here. \nCrow Horse rises, points down the road. \nCROW HORSE The killin' was done where Leo's mother lives. But he was driven here into these Badlands. \nRay is frowning at the big Indian, trying to get a fix on this \nCROW HORSE Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen -- \nRAY Bullshit. \nCROW HORSE -- Well, maybe two-seventeen. \nRAY You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track? \nCROW HORSE No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth. \nRAY Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area. \nCROW HORSE No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long. \nRAY You've got no jurisdiction. \nCROW HORSE You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter. \nRAY Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here. \nCROW HORSE Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is -- \nRAY -- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota. \nCROW HORSE I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs. \nRAY His spiritual mother... \nCROW HORSE To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them. \nRAY Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security. \nCROW HORSE Easy. Easy... I'm goin'. \nCrow Horse walks back up toward the road. \nRay lets him leave then crouches where Crow Horse was, begins looking at tracks. \nCROW HORSE (O.S.) Hey, Little Weasel. \nRay turns, and sees Crow Horse perched on a high bank -- the one Ray came down -- and he's in a tracking stance. \nCROW HORSE You weigh one sixty-three, yeah? Not a beer drinker. You're one of these tofu and pilaf characters. Pack your gun, under your coat -- left shoulder. But you got backup; a little .32, .38 maybe, in a ankle holster that gives you a right foot drag, Shoes are too tight at the toe but, man, they look cool. And that's what counts. \nRay just stands frozen, blown away. Crow Horse rises, dusting off his hands, and heading to his vehicle. \nRAY Crow Horse. \nThe Indian turns. The wind moans. Ray scrutinizes him, deliberating. \nRAY Fuck you. \nCrow Horse grins and waves, and ambles away. DOWN IN \nTHE BADLANDS \nRay stands, sweating under his suit jacket, and not sure if he's amazed or pissed off. \n", "test1_id": 1410, "test2_input": "LAUGHTER. Except for Cooch who just stares at Ray, digesting what he has said. \nRAY They don't smoke hooch in The Pipe, Miles. They smoke something called kinickinick, it's like a tobacco. \nSherman looks at Cooch. \nSA SHERMAN Well, you're right about X21 being a Washington Redskin, that's for sure. What else, Ray? \nCOOCH You boys want a soda? \nSA MILES Oh, yeah, a Coke. You buying? \nCOOCH No, Ray's buying. Sherman? Coke? \nSHERMAN Oh... no. No, Cooch, I'm working on a coffee here. Indian walk? \nCooch nods to Ray and Ray follows, gathering up some paperwork He looks determined as a terrier. \nEXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - NIGHT \nRay and Cooch throw long, slim shadows on their way to an archaic Coke machine. \nCOOCH Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house. \nRAY When did we get that? \nCOOCH Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van -- \nRAY -- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of -- \nCOOCH You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me. \nRAY I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed. \nCOOCH Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray... \nRAY I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer. \nCOOCH Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised. \nRay studies him with a smile building. Cooch shrugs, sips some soda. \nRAY Alright. Alright... \nCOOCH (lightly) Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar. \nRay nods, starting for the van. \nCOOCH Ray. \nHe turns. Cooch looks at him for a time. It is a warm look. \nCOOCH I'll sleep around a little. \nRAY Thanks, Cooch. \nCOOCH And get rid of the dog. \nRay gets in and pulls the dog out. The dog sits at roadside, tilting its head at him, confused. And he pulls out. It runs after him. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD NEAR EAGLE BEAR'S - RES - NIGHT \nThe van sits parked down the road from Maggie's dimly-lit home. Ray sits behind the wheel, watching the house. LOCUSTS make a steady and unnerving sound. It is black. Black under big sky. Ray lets his head sag out the open window and he takes in the vastness. \nPOV: stars. Millions of stars. And an incredible full moon. It hangs huge over distant fields, a perfect sphere. The top half of the moon is yellow, the bottom half a lava red. \nREVERSE - RAY \nstares at it, lost in thought. From Maggie's house, he hears someone SINGING. Singing a traditional SUNDANCE SONG while they haul water from the creek. A WOMAN'S VOICE, trilling out the beautiful but haunting \"hey-o-hey-o-hey-o-hey-ohhhhh.\" \nRay just sits, listening. And then something draws his attention to his rearview mirror. \nThe res dog, lying in the back seat is GROWLING. Lip curled back, growling low. \nRay looks at him, looks out the window. Blackness. Nothing but the sound of locusts. And a slight crosswind in the wheat fields. The dog stops growling. And Ray fixes his gaze on the house again, lifting a pair of binoculars and -- \nBOOOOOOM! The rear windshield is SHATTERED by an explosion. Ray throws himself low across the passenger seat -- BOOOOOM! The driver's side window and part of the door explodes. \nRES ROAD NEAR EAGLE BEAR'S \nThe federal van is HAMMERED BY GUNFIRE. All the windows, shattered, the metal doors splayed. Someone is going for the kill, \nTHE PASSENGER DOOR \nis thrown open just as its window implodes, and Ray slides out belly first, gripping his M-16 and crawling like a dog soldier into tall wheat at roadside as the car, the road, the wheat, the dirt, the night are slammed by gunfire. \n", "test2_true": "RAY (whispering) Motherfucker. \nLONG SHOT - THE ROAD \nthe decimated van, aerial still high. The distant lights of Maggie's house. And the giant Moon, hovering over it all. \nHEARTBEAT DRUM into -- \nSAME ROAD \u0096 RES - DAWN \nTWENTY FEDS comb the dirt road, the wheat fields, picking up shells with gloved hands, scanning the vast distance. \nIN THE FRONT YARD of Maggie's, FOUR INDIAN CHILDREN stand with the Old Woman, watching. \nINT. LE BARON \u0096 TRAVELING \u0096 ANOTHER DIRT ROAD \nCooch, flushed in the face, mans the wheel. He wears only a T-shirt which indicates, a desperate rush to the scene. His eyes scan the surrounding homes and fields. \nIn the passenger seat, Ray sits, drinking a coffee. He looks haggard. \nCOOCH Bastards... \nRAY All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home. \nCOOCH He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer. \nRay turns around in his seat, looking off across dry land. \nRAY It may have been Maggie's way of saying \"get off my ass.\" \nCOOCH She's that subtle? \nRAY Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says. \nCOOCH Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't -- \nRAY -- Cooch. Woh. Stop. \nHe does. Ray is turned around in his seat, staring off into the distance. \nEXT. DIRT ROAD \nThe Le Baron whines backward, and off the road, into some grass Ray steps out, keeping his gaze fixed. Cooch bails from the driver's side, joins him. \nHEARTBEAT DRUM. \nRAY'S POV: Four-hundred feet across a flat area of sandstone and grass clusters, something shimmers in the undulations of the harsh morning sun. Something of pea green and rusty metal... glass catches sunlight and makes prisms. A car. An old res car, sitting in a long, chasm in barely a foot of green water. \nEXT. DRY WASH - SHORT TIME LATER - PAY \nRay and Cooch go through the car, around the car, with gloved hands and grease pencils and plastic bags, sweating in the hot sun. \nCOOCH Tread matches. It's the car. \nRAY Yes. \nExcited, Ray walks off, scanning the area. \nCOOCH But this doesn't make any sense, Ray. If it's just been sitting in this dry wash for seven days... why the hell didn't we find it? \nRay picks up a handful of stones, sifts them in his hands. \nRAY Because this isn't a dry wash. \nCooch watches him slosh shoes first through a rut where the water shimmers a foot deep or less. \nRAY It's the Little Walking River. \nRay turns, shucking up mud. \nRAY And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river. \nCOOCH The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn. \nRay doesn't hear Cooch. He stares past the SAC at the long wide chasm, wet in some places, arid in others, and what he hears must be an echo in his head. \nRAY Listen to the water... \nCooch is listening to a TRANSMISSION across his radio and he walks off a few feet, exchanging information with the REGIONALS. \nRay stands, ankle deep in stagnant water, his face sweat- soaked, his eyes transfixed on heat undulations. \nEXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - ROOM 13 - DAY \n", "test2_id": 1411, "test3_input": "CROW HORSE Why? So you can get rid of me, too? \nRAY No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go. \nCrow Horse lies there, breathing heavy. Ray on top of him, still clutching his gun. \nINT. LE BARON - TRAVELING - NIGHT \nRay and Crow Horse are quiet as they eat up the dirt roads. \nCROW HORSE Maybe the old man's visions are still strong. \nRay nods, concentrating. After a time: \nRAY Do they come in dreams, these visions? \nCROW HORSE Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when. \nRAY Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo. \nWhen Crow Horse doesn't respond, Ray looks over and finds him staring. He looks back to the road. And when he looks back at Crow Horse, he is still staring at him. \nCROW HORSE Where was this? \nRAY At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why? \nCROW HORSE You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty. \nRAY Well, it was just a dream, I -- \nCROW HORSE Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you? \nRAY What do you mean? \nCROW HORSE Nothin'. Forget it. \nCrow Horse looks out the window as if to avoid Ray who is confused by the Indian's smoldering. After a moment, Crow Horse looks at him. \nCROW HORSE You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision. \nRAY Sorry. \nCROW HORSE I'm a full-blood Oglala. \nRAY We've driven a long way. Where is this place? \nCROW HORSE Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams? \nRAY Yeah. Fitful dreams. \nCrow Horse feels better. He looks out the window, nodding. But it doesn't last long. \nCROW HORSE Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones. \nRAY What the hell do you want me to do?! \nCROW HORSE Stop. \nRay brakes. Crow Horse is looking past him. Ray turns. The spectacular mesa that we have admired with every sunrise, looms massive now that we are under it. Moonlight falls on it. And the HEARTBEAT DRUM pulses from it. \nEXT. WHERE-THE-ELK-PEOPLE-USED-TO-LIVE - NIGHT \nThe land behind Red Deer Table is Badlands. Badlands pierced by a few rutted old wagon roads. At a place between two grotesque buttes, Crow Horse stops, looking uneasy. \nHe digs into his pocket, pulls out some loose tobacco and spills it on the ground. Then he walks on. \nRay observes this, starting forward, then stopping long enough to fish a cigarette out from his pocket and drop it next to Crow Horse's offering. \nTHROUGH THE BADLANDS \nRay and Crow Horse walk, carefully under a full moon, scanning the area. Crow Horse stops, checks out some tracks. Ray walks on, looking up at the table. He shines his flashlight up and it illuminates -- \nA RED RIBBON, tied on stakes on a ridge. Ten stakes. Twenty stakes. Ribbons blowing in the wind. \nRAY What's that? \nCROW HORSE Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure. \nRay sweeps the light along, walking faster, and then something frightening occurs. Something... some unseen thing snags him by the leg, sucking him into the Earth with a horrible GUSHING SOUND. \nRay is drawn into a hole up to his hips, a bluish-black slime, oozing out around him. Crow Horse grabs him, struggling to pull him up. He does, stumbling back and stepping into a hole himself. \nThe two men are wheeling, throwing flashlight beams around, slapping through a wet jelly, and finally getting their bearings. \nRay touches the ground where a blue-black chemical solution oozes out with water from the aquifer below. His flashlight scans -- \n", "test3_true": "RAY Jesus. Oil? \nCROW HORSE Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry. \nRAY \nCROW HORSE What? \nRAY That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium. \nCROW HORSE We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water. \nRAY Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved. \nCROW HORSE So they took care of Leo. \nRAY Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again. \nRay goes to another hole and sticks his arm in up to the elbow, sniffs the solution. \nCROW HORSE They're drainin' our water table. That's our life, man... \nRay is looking past Crow Horse at -- \nSomething strange in the moonlight. COYOTES. Some forty yards away, on a flat stretch of stoney ground. Six Coyotes, dancing in the shadows of rock formations. MOVING IN ON THEM as Ray walks forward, they circle... scatter... run back... circle again. Look straight at Ray, eyes glowing. \nAnd run. \nREVERSE - RAY \nand Crow Horse walk toward them. To the place they just left. A place in the dirt, they were digging up. When they reach it, they stare down into the dirt. \nA BODY \nlies there, face down. Denim jacket and a shock of black hair, thrown into tangles and dirt. It was buried. Until the coyote caught wind. Crow Horse bends down, touches the jacket... turns the body over And almost vomits when he sees Maggie Eagle Bear. \nRAY \nlooks down in disbelief. \nRAY No. No... \nRay steps back, his boots squishing in solution and sealant and soiled water. He covers his mouth, stopping himself from getting sick. And then he explodes, YELLING. \nLONG SHOT - RED DEER TABLE \nin the moonlight. And RAY'S YELLING ECHOING up out of the rocks \nEXT. BEAR CREEK VILLAGE - NIGHT \nThe sordid little village the feds first drove through sits sleepy on the rim of sunrise. \nA DOG BARKS hollow as the Crow Horse motorcycle chutters down and coasts up in front of one of the little homes -- rundown but it has a satellite dish and a decent car like so many. The Le Baron pulls up behind it. \nINT. LE BARON - NIGHT \nCrow Horse walks over to Ray's window, his jeans and boots muddy. No one speaks for a long moment, the night filled by crickets. And that one dog. \nRAY This Clear Moon's house? \nCROW HORSE Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man. \nCrow Horse crosses the street. Ray sits there, and he looks almost hurt by this statement. But he is the white man. But he is Indian. He lets a long breath escape, rubs at a temple. He takes out a smoke. Tries to light it. His hands are shaking too badly. But he gets it lit, and sits tense, looking in his rearview. \nINT. CLEAR MOON HOUSE - NIGHT \nOliver Clear Moon sits in a chair, his strong Indian mouth, beginning to tighten at the jowls. \nAcross from him, Crow Horse sits on the edge of a couch. MRS. CLEAR MOON, a rotund, gentle woman brings him a coffee. A TEENAGE GIRL in a men's extra-large T-shirt stands in the hall, looking at him. \nClear Moon in pajamas, rises, and with a coffee in hand, starts walking in slow steps toward the kitchen. He loses control before he gets there and hurls the cup across the room into the sink, smashing it. He wheels and faces Crow Horse. He SPEAKS LAKOTA. Asking questions. Crow Horse SPEAKS LAKOTA. Answering him. \nMrs. Clear Moon, understanding, shakes her head in disbelief and her eyes begin to well. Oliver, walking back to his chair, sits, and thinks for a moment. MORE LAKOTA. He gets up, goes to a drawer and rummages. He sits again, and tosses something onto the coffee table. It is a badge. A tribal police badge. \nINT. LE BARON - PARKED - CLEAR MOON'S - DAWN \nRay nervously awaits Crow Horse's words as he appears at the window again. The Indian shows hope in his tired eyes. \nCROW HORSE Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing. \nRAY What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird. \nCrow Horse looks at Ray who stares dead ahead. \n", "test3_id": 1412}

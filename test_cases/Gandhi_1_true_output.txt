CHARLIE I lied to you, Mohan, when I told you I decided to come to South Africa to meet you. Professor Gokhale sent me. 
Gokhale is pleased, Gandhi amused. He bows very respectfully. 
GOKHALE We're trying to make a nation, Gandhi -- and the British keep trying to break us up into religions and principalities and "provinces." What you were writing in South Africa -- that's what we need here. 
He has offered his hand during this, and Gandhi has helped him from the garden chair he has been seated on, handing him the cane that is resting against it. 
GANDHI (a smile) I have much to learn about India. And I have to begin my practice again -- one needs money to run a journal. 
Another grin. Gokhale has started to walk with him, looking at him intently, penetratingly. 
GOKHALE Nonsense. (He turns to Charlie) Go on, Charlie. This is Indian talk -- we want none of you imperialists. 
It is brusque but affectionate; we know he regards Charlie as Gandhi does... and Charlie does too. 
CHARLIE (a mock threat) All right -- I'll go and write my report to the Viceroy. 
GOKHALE Go and find a pretty Hindu woman and convert her to Christianity -- that's as much mischief as you're allowed. 
He still hasn't smiled, but Gandhi and Charlie have. 
ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDEN 
This is private -- beautiful and still. Gandhi walks along slowly, taking the pace of the ailing Gokhale. 
GOKHALE Forget your practice. India has many men with too much wealth -- it is their privilege to nourish the efforts of the few who can raise India from servitude and apathy. I will see to it -- you begin your journal. 
GANDHI I have little to say. India is an "alien" country to me. 
He grins self-deprecatingly but Gokhale persists. 
GOKHALE Well, change that. Go and find India. Not what you see here, but the real India. You'll see what needs to be said. What we need to hear. 
He pauses and looks at Gandhi -- and for the first time he smiles. When he speaks his voice is thick with feeling. 
GOKHALE When I saw you in that tunic I knew... I knew I could die in peace. (A dying man's command) Make India proud of herself. 
His eyes are watery with emotion, but he stares at Gandhi rigidly. 
CUT TO: 
TRAIN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT 
Indian. Steam. A breed of its own. 
THIRD CLASS COACH - INTERIOR - NIGHT 
Gandhi sits by a window in the dimly lit coach. Ba sleeps on the seat next to him, another member of the party next to her. Gandhi's solemn eyes are studying the huddled humanity in the rocking coach. People are sleeping everywhere, some half-erect on the benches, many on the floor among the bundles and trunks and bedrolls and baskets. Some have children, some are very old. One old man, sleepless like Gandhi, stares back at him across the shadowed squalor of the coach; somewhere unseen a crying baby is soothed by his mother. 
Gandhi looks at the bench across from him. Charlie Andrews, his tall frame cramped in a tiny space between the window looks at Gandhi dozily, a little smile of sufferance, then he closes his eyes again, leaning his head against the rocking window frame. 
NARROW STREET - A SMALL TOWN - EXTERIOR - DAY 
Gandhi is carried along in a ceremonial chair borne on the shoulders of some trotting men. The chair is swathed in flowers, and flowers are being showered on Gandhi by the running children and the crowd lining the narrow street. Ba and Charlie and two others are following in a flower-bedecked ox-cart, lost in the mass of people that are swirling around Gandhi. 
On a building top a British officer watches emotionlessly as Gandhi and the crowd pass below him. On this building and others we see some on his Indian soldiers watching with their rifles beside them. 
INDIAN VILLAGES - EXTERIOR - DAY 
As from a train... but the shots are varied; some close of farmers and water buffalo, and ragged children and women in colorful saris carrying pots on their heads, and some distant of villages as units, one and another and another. 
INTERCUT ALWAYS WITH: 
TRAIN - INTERIOR - DAY 
Gandhi's face in the window, he and Ba standing, looking out together, neither speaking. Gandhi writing in the cramped chaos of the Third Class coaches. Gandhi sweeping part of the carriage, making disgruntled passengers move as he tries to bring some cleanliness to their surroundings. 
RIVER VISTA - EXTERIOR - DAY 
A broad alluvial plain, the river threading through it, purple and gold in the rising sun. The camera races with the train along the river's edge, the reflected sun glimmering on the windows. 
RIVER BANK - EXTERIOR - DAY 
The sun is high and the train is stopped by the river. People have come out of the coaches to cool their heads with the touch of water, to stretch their legs. 
We see an English clergyman from the Second Class coaches, dipping a toe cautiously into the water, children of some British enlisted soldiers wading, splashing, faces alight with fun. 
And, farther along, the parasols of one or two of the English First Class passengers, a woman dousing her neck delicately with perfume. A British officer, tunic unbuttoned, smoking a long cigar as he walks along in a few inches of water, his trousers rolled up, his shoes off. 
Across the river down from the Third Class coaches a small group of Indian women is squatted by the river's edge, washing clothes. Some carry infants on their backs. Some small children stand near them. Their ritual of washing goes on, but they are all watching the passengers of the train. 
Gandhi stands with Ba and Charlie among the Third Class passengers. Ba cools her face with water. Charlie, his trousers rolled up, plays a tentative splashing game with a skinny little Indian boy. Gandhi is holding a large white head cloth which he is soaking in the water, but his eyes have been arrested by the sight of the women across the river. 
And now we see the women closely from his point of view, the camera panning slowly along them. Their bodies are skin and bone. The clothes they wear, which looked normal from the distance, are rags -- literally, shredded rages, one hung on another. The children are hollow-eyed and gaunt, staring listlessly at the train. One boy, with a stump for an arm, aimlessly pushes at the flies that buzz around him. 
Gandhi stands erect, lost now in the revelation of their poverty. His eyes hold on one woman at the river bank. Though her frail face is almost skeletal, it is beautiful but scarred by a severe rash down her cheek and neck. The cloth she is washing is a shredded piece of muslin. Her eyes have met Gandhi's as he watches her. 
Gandhi stares for a moment, a long beat. Then he slowly moves his arm out into the water and, without taking his eyes from her, releases the head cloth he has been rinsing. It floats along on the water down toward the woman. 
She looks from Gandhi to it with sudden excitement, a sense of incredulity. As the cloth nears her, she rises and moves almost greedily out into the water to take it. Her hands snatch at it quickly. Then she stands, looking at Gandhi. The infant on her back shifts, its huge hollow eyes reacting to the movement. 
Gandhi smiles slowly, tilting his head just slightly to her. And now that she has possession of the cloth, her manner calms again. And she looks back at him, and her lips almost part with a tiny smile of thanks. 
Hold Gandhi, staring at her, fighting the pain in his eyes... 
TRAIN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT 
Threading like a lighted necklace across the darkness of a vast plain. 
TRAIN IN HILLS - EXTERIOR - DAY 
Climbing green hills -- a totally different terrain -- and again we intercut, this time the train climbing: a boy and buffalo running a huge, crude grinding wheel, train climbing; farmers in terraced fields, train climbing faster and faster... until suddenly with a hoot of the whistle and the screech of brakes it stops! 
TRAIN - EXTERIOR - DAY 
Gandhi is leaning out of a window in a Third Class coach. Ahead of him other passengers are looking too; some have jumped down. 
Gandhi and Charlie jump down too. As they come clear they can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them. A small troop of cavalry are coming slowly along the line of Gandhi's train toward them. 
Featuring the cavalry. They are British and their troop leader is viciously angry. 
TROOP LEADER Clear the way! Get out of the way! 
He is swinging his sword, not lethally, but threateningly at the Indian passengers from the train. His British NCOs are equally angry and deliberately ride close to the passengers, forcing them back against the train.

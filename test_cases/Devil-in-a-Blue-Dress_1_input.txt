Easy cocks his head "Are you crazy?" 
JOPPY (continuing) Sound like he just wants you to keep your eyes open for somebody... He'll pay you whether you see anything or not... If it was me I'd take that man's money and go on about my bidness... Ain't nothin' to worry about. 
Easy is still suspicious, but can't take his eyes off the card. 
EASY (V.O.) When somebody tells me "Don't worry," I usually look down to see if my fly is open... I noticed Albright didn't bother to pay for his drink.

Duke Ellington's "Mood Indigo" plays on the radio as Easy heads for home in thought. 
EASY (V.O.) (continuing) DeWitt Albright reminded me of somebody I knew back in Houston. His name was Raymond Alexander but we called him Mouse... Mouse called hisself a businessman too. And I found out that I shouldn't be nowhere around when Mouse got down to his business... I learned that the hard way. 
A neighbor sweeps out her front porch and waves at Easy as he slows down in front of his house.

A MAN with an unruly head of hair and full beard pushing a wheelbarrow with a double edged axe wheels up behind Easy as he opens his gate. 
WOODCUTTER Want me to knock down some of them trees back there for you? 
EASY (irritated) No... Just leave the trees alone. 
Easy continues up his walkway past flower beds of dahlias and wild roses and stops on his front porch to check on his African violets in a jar next to the front door.

He walks into his tiny living room and tosses his jacket onto the sofa. Then moves on through the kitchen and out the back door.

He picks up a water hose and turns on the faucet, watering and admiring his apple, avocado, pomegranate and banana trees as he lights a cigarette. 
EASY (V.O.) I had moved to Los Angeles right after the war with three hundred dollars and the G.I. Bill... And I liked coming home to a place that was mine... According to President Truman I had that comin' to me 'cause I had fought in 'the good war' against Hitler in Europe... But that didn't mean a damn thing to a lotta white folks including the foreman on my job... So, here I was out of work needin' thirty-two dollars to pay the mortgage... That was three days pay on my old job -- and I had about three days to get it. 
10   EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT                                    10

A small white MAN pops out from behind a hedge startling Easy. He wears a suit that also serves as a uniform. 
SECURITY GUARD What are you doing here? 
EASY I'm looking for, uh... 
SECURITY GUARD We only take deliveries between nine and six... 
EASY No, no... I... 
SECURITY GUARD Yes, we do!   Now you'd better leave. 
He clutches a baton in his hand and swats it into his open palm. 
EASY Uh... Albright! 
SECURITY GUARD What? 
EASY I'm here to see Mr. Albright. DeWitt Albright! 
SECURITY GUARD Where's your delivery? 
He holds out his scrawny hand. 
EASY I have an appointment -- I'm supposed to meet him. 
12   CONTINUED:                                                     12 
SECURITY GUARD Did he give you a note to come in here after hours? 
Easy only stares, hating this little man. 
SECURITY GUARD Well, did he?   Because if he didn't--

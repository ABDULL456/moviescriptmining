RACHAEL A part of me is glad.  I think I feel more.  I don't like who I was before. 
Deckard nods, waits the respectable interval and is glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen. 
In the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen Deckard looks around for a place to put the plate, but things have piled up on him in here.  He contemplates the refrig- erator. 
DECKARD So why do you think they were after their records. 
He's a lot more comfortable talking shop. 
RACHAEL They probably want to find out when they were made. 
DECKARD Right. 
He dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out. She's writing something on a card. 
RACHAEL I guess the date of your birth is important if you know you're not made to last. 
No way he can keep his foot out of it.  She looks up and hands him the card. 
RACHAEL That's my number.  If you need me. 
She goes to the door, opens it but hesitates before going through. 
RACHAEL You better get better locks -- if you want to keep me out. 
She looks back at him and smiles -- the smile says she's talking about all kinds of locks.  Deckard looks like he might ask her to stay, but... 
RACHAEL Good night. 
And she's gone. 
DECKARD Night. 
He looks down at the number.  It's the back side of a snapshot.   He turns it over.  The picture of a man and a woman.  The little girl between them looks like a six-year old Rachael. 
INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        54 
He's sitting in front of his console studying pictures of Nexus Sixes at they appear, blank-faced, hairless and unadorned on his monitor. 
The over-lay machine is transforming each image with instant attributes; hair, moustaches, teeth, eye colors, age, youth, hats, glasses, etc.  All in rapid succession, running the gambit from ominous to beautiful. 
DECKARD (V.O.) The possibilities were infinite. They could change their appearances but not their future. Like she said, it was short. Longevity is what they were after. The garbage man even wanted a past. Poor fuck.  I'd check it out but I knew she was right.  The market worked on turn-over.  Built-in obsolescence was the name of the game.  That meant her too.  It was something I didn't want to think about. 
On top of the monitor there's an open can of beans with a spoon stuck in it.  Deckard puts out his cigarette and reaches for them as the PHONE RINGS. 
DECKARD Yeah. 
BRYANT Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it. 
DECKARD I was just about to have my dinner. 
BRYANT If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck. 
Deckard hangs up and looks at the beans.  He didn't want them anyway.  He gets up and walks to the bedroom. Looks through the pile of clothes on the floor, finds his ankle laser and straps it on. 
EXT. CITY - BIRD'S EYE VIEW - NIGHT                     55 
The spinner skirts through the canyons of the city. Deckard, sitting in the contoured seat, watches the maze of suspension bridges, platforms and catwalks swing by below.  The tops of larger buildings shimmer with advertisements and weather announcements. 
INT. SPINNER - OVER CITY - NIGHT                        56 
Deckard is cruising low and slow over the city listen- ing to Esper. 
EPSER Nexus designated Rachael is a prototype.  Created for in-house use by special mandate form the Scientific Development Regulatory Committee.  Will live conventional term -- no para-physical abilities. 
DECKARD What is a conventional term? 
ESPER Four years.  Which would make her termination date... 
DECKARD Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge? 
ESPER Longevity is classified.  No. 
Back to business.

O-REN ISHII Screams at her "...last line of defense;" 
O-REN (ENGLISH) What are you waiting for? Are you on a date? Attack her you fool! 
THE BRIDE Oh my God... (pause) ...She just called you a fool. She just called you a fool in front of me. Not only am I your opponent. I'm a female fellow countryman. And you're going to risk your life - to say nothing of harming me - for a woman who refers to you as a fool? 
O-REN is furious, and slaps Mr. Barrel on the shoulder. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Attack, Goddamn you! 
The Bride acts like she's embarrassed to witness what she just saw. 
Mr. Barrel spins in O-Ren's direction shooting her a look she's never seen from him before. 
He then looks back to the Bride. 
Her eyes are waiting for his. She says with just the slightest hint of plea in her voice; 
THE BRIDE I'll owe ya one. 
He looks at her a BEAT longer...then says as he resheaths his sword; 
MR. BARREL The things I do for a pretty face. 
INSERT: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath, The Handle locks into place with a Click. 
He looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress, and says; 
MR. BARREL (JAPANESE) I quit. 
O-Ren fries and egg on her head. 
Then   with his sheathed Sword    in his right hand, and his left hand   in his pants pocket, he    walks across the carnage-strewn room   and out the front door.    As he walks, when he's parallel with   the Bride, He stops and    says; 
MR. BARREL About that one you owe me. 
THE BRIDE Yes? 
MR. BARREL I'm gonna collect someday, you know? 
THE BRIDE I'll be disappointed if you don't. 
He continues walking without a look back. Before he Exits the restaurant, he throws a look in Sofie's direction, Who's lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood, and says; 
MR. BARREL Tough luck bout that arm Sofe. 
He exits the Movie. 
O-REN and The BRIDE match eyes. The Japanese gal says; 
O-REN (ENGLISH) Very funny. (pause) Your instrument is quite impressive. 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Domo. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Where was it made? 
THE BRIDE Okinawa. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Whom in Okinawa made you this steel? 
THE BRIDE This is Hattori Hanzo steel. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) YOU LIE!! 
The Bride just smiles at her rival's response. 
O-Ren's composure returns. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Swords however never get tired. I hope you've saved your energy. If you haven't, you might not last five minutes. (pause) 
Have you seen the garden in this establishment? 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) No. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) Oh, you really should. It's quite beautiful. Allow me. 
O-Ren moves out of the position she's stood in for the entire battle. She steps on the doormat of a corpse, that serves the same purpose of a bottom step, and moves over to the white paper wall and slides it open....REVEALING.... 
.....A WHITE WINTER WONDERLAND, set against a Jet Black sky. A Snow-covered Japanese Garden awaits right outside. Snow falls from the sky (Slightly artificial, not phony - but Operatic/Theatrical). O-Ren stands next to the Bride in the doorway looking out into the white night. 
O-REN (JAPANESE) As last looks go, you could do worse. 
The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld steps outside... 
The Bride follows her... 
INT. SNOW-COVERED JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT 
As snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance from one another. 
COMBAT MUSIC BEGINS PLAYING, but not Japanese drums - Spanish Flamenco Guitar....... 
The Bride Unsheaths her Sword Quickly...Holding it out in front of her...Tip of Blade pointed at O-Ren...Sword's Handle and her Fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her cheek...Her eyes are Reflected on the Blade...Snow falls around her. 
O-Ren begins walking forward towards the Bride...She raises up her Sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face vertically...then begins slowly unsheathing it...Snow falls around her. 
O-REN'S FEET White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow underneath them... 
The BRIDE Holding Sword...Eyes reflected in Blade...her Yellow Sneakers Crunching snow underneath them... 
O-REN when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird.... 
....The Two Women circle each other.... 
They SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...CIRCLE...SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE... 
O-REN LEAPS in the air does a Somersault over the Bride's head, landing behind her opponent. She brings her Sword down in a Slashing Swing... 
SLASHING The BRIDE across her back - Spinning her around... 
O-Ren goes in for the kill...The Bride meets her blade... The Blades Clash and Lock...The Two Women's faces come together as the Blades become entangled... 
O-Ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into The Bride's mouth... 
Knocking her backwards over a small, stone bench - Flat on her ass in a koi pond. 
- The Combat Guitar Stops - 
O-Ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, She laughs; 
O-REN (ENGLISH) Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords. Bill might of humored you, but you will find neither humor nor mercy at my blade. Now unless you intend to commit sepeku among the koi, stand up and fight. You may not be able to fight like a samurai, but you can at least die like a samurai. 
The Combat Guitar starts again...As The Bride slowly rises out of the koi pond. She brings up her sword and Says Calmly to O-Ren in Japanese; 
THE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Attack me. With everything you have. 
The Two Women Clash Swords furiously, their attack ends with 
The Bride's Striking O-Ren - not fatally - but deep. They separate... 
...breathing hard...Cold Air coming out of their mouths like two locomotives... 
O-Ren looks down to her wound, then back up to The Bride. The respect for the Bride's ability is transparent. 
The Two Women Circle Stalk each other again... 
Red Blood running down Yellow Legs onto Yellow Sneakers... 
Wooden Clogs crunching the Snow, Blood trail dripping down legs staining White Socks with Red... 
They Attack, the Geisha figurine and The tall western girl with the mane of Whipping Blonde Hair. They Swing - Twist - Turn - Clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off. 
Both Women are out of breath and have    to stop to recuperate. As they both drink the harsh cold air    into their lungs, leaving red blood stains in the white    snow, the two females have the same thought. The next clash    will be their last.

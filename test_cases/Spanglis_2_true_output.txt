HISPANIC MAN 
I don't know. She just doesn't want to. 
DEBORAH 
Will you please just tell me what she said. 
HISPANIC MAN 
She said, "I just don't want to." 
EVELYN 
If she didn't tell us about her child she has to have a deep sense of privacy. We can figure out how she can still live at home. Hell, I don't mind driving her at night. 
DEBORAH 
Let's spare the world you on the roads. (to Flor) Well, what do we do? The Hispanic man translates the last sentence. Deborah and Flor stare at each other..Deborah's next words are somber and have enough body language to transcend the need for translation...the jig is up. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
(big decision) I'm sorry, my friend, this is what I need. It's just for the summer. I don't want to lose you. But .... Flor indicates there is no need to translate. A beat. 
FLOR 
(enormous decision) Yo vivo aqu√å. 
HISPANIC MAN 
She'll live here. The man says something in Spanish to Flor as she starts to walk away and she is thrown enough by the statement to actually stumble as she looks back at him...then, before Deborah can admonish him. 
HISPANIC MAN (CONT'D) 
I said, "God protect you from that boss." 
87   EXT. FLOR'S APT. COMPLEX - DAY                               87 
As Cristina, trying to suppress her grin, skips quickly down the stairs moving towards a truck from John's restaurant. Flor follows tight lipped - resolved. They each carry many clothes on wire hangers. A group of girls on the balcony literally cheer Cristina on. 
BALCONY GIRLS 
(accented) 
MAL-----I------BU! 
Cristina grins hugely back at them. 
88   INT. MALIBU TUNNEL - DAY                                     88 
The two women in the truck and then.. 
89   INT. TRUCK - DAY.                                            89 
As the truck leaves the tunnel and all is cliffs, sand, and waves..Cristina taking it in, unaware that her mother's eyes never leave her. 
She gasps frequently..MAJOR GIANT ORGANIC GASPS OF WONDER AND PLEASURE..This is awe as an active physical exercise. The MOVING SHOT dramatizes the crossroads of the mother-daughter relationship as the TWO SHOT finds Flor becoming first blurred then lost as we focus on Cristina exclaiming over each new sight. 
NARRATOR 
(over this incidental dialogue) The first time one sees natural beauty which is owned by others confounds the senses.. I had never imagined the word "money" could be associated with anything but the anxiety of not having enough. I didn't know God had a toy store for the rich. 
90   EXT. CLASKY BEACH HOUSE - STREET SIDE - DAY                 90 
The truck in the driveway..the women walking through a front door into a court yard. 
91   EXT. CLASKY BEACH HOUSE - BEACH SIDE - DAY                  91 
Georgie, in a swim suit, talking to CHUM in the manner of people trying to excite dogs. 
GEORGIE 
Who wants to go swimming?..Yes, who wants to go swimming? The dog goes crazy with excitement -- then, droll for a nine year old, Georgie turns to his grandmother (who is sunning herself and reading) and addresses her in precisely the same way. Evelyn has a drink in hand.. 
GEORGIE (CONT'D) 
(to grandmother) Who wants to go swimming?..Huh.. 
EVELYN 
Not now..But I promise I'll go in the summer after next. John enters the scene.. 
JOHN 
You want to go swimming? 
GEORGIE 
Oh yeah, you're off. 
JOHN 
What do you think, wet suits? 
GEORGIE 
Wet suits are for wimps.. 
JOHN 
Yeah, you're right..let me get mine.. Georgie laughs.. 
GEORGIE 
(to Dad) You're good. 
92   INT./EXT. HALLWAY / PATIO - DAY                              92 
Behind Flor and Cristina as they move toward the Claskys and their destiny....Flor behind her daughter. 
REVERSE - CLOSE ON CRISTINA. 
As her eyes pop on seeing the Clasky beach house. 
VERY CLOSE ON DEBORAH 
As her eyes pop on seeing the stunning twelve year-old enter her home, haloed by the sun. Again, Flor less distinct in the background. Bernice, just outside the open patio door, is putting on a shirt over her bathing suit as she looks at Cristina and emits a small, prescient moan. 
DEBORAH 
(to Flor) Look at this child..Flor, you could make a fortune at surrogate pregnancy.... Flor looks to her daughter for some understanding of what Deborah said.. 
FLOR 
Que? Cristina is as nonplussed by the remark as her mother.

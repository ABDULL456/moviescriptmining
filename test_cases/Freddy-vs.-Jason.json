KITCHEN - MORNING \nCLOSE ON a small television set on the kitchen table. A flashy graphic flashes across the screen: AM NEWS SPECIAL REPORT -- COPS V.S. THE CULT -- DAY 13.  A NEWS REPORTER stands in front a police blockade. In the background, dozens of POLICE and S.W.A.T. MEN surround a small run-down, two-story house... Freddy's house. \nNEWS REPORTER (filtered) As the sun rises on yet another morning, still no end in sight for the standoff between police and the mysterious group known only as the \"Freddy\" cult who seized the abandoned house behind me just thirteen days ago.  These cultists -- mostly run- away teenagers -- have managed to keep police at bay for almost two weeks while inside they take mind- altering narcotics in order to communicate with their god -- Freddy. \nThe reporter babbles on as Meagan enters the kitchen where MEAGAN'S MOM is sitting watching the TV, gulping down orange juice.  Across from mom is MEAGAN'S DAD, who is having coffee, reading the paper.  Meagan pours herself a cup and sits. \nMEAGAN Morning. \nMeagan's mom grunts, transfixed on the news.  Dad looks over his paper long enough to smile and say, just a little too cheerfully: \nMEAGAN'S DAD Morning, Meagan. \nMeagan looks over at her mother, then back at her father, mouthing the words \"How's mom?\", when suddenly Meagan's mom bellows: \nMEAGAN'S MOM (calls upstairs) Lizzy! Get down here! Breakfast is almost ready! \nMeagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back into his paper.  Meagan sighs and sips her coffee. \nANGLE ON TV -- a police booking photo of FRED KRUEGER. \nNEWS REPORTER Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger was released on a legal technicality but later burned to death at the hands of a vigilante mob of grieving parents.  Some years later, a rash of bizarre and unexplainable teen- age deaths began leaving many in the area to wonder... is Freddy really dead? \nMeagan's younger sister -- LIZZY -- comes down to breakfast.  The microwave DINGS and Meagan's mom pulls out three Pop Tarts, dealing them out to her family like playing cards.  Lizzy picks up her Pop Tart, whining. \nMEAGAN'S MOM Hurry up and eat. You don't want to be late for special school. \nMEAGAN Mom! Don't call it that! \nLIZZY I hate that school. The other kids are mean... and they're all re- tard-ed! \nMeagan snickers. \nMEAGAN'S MOM We don't use that word. They're \"special\" children just like you're \"special\". \nDad looks over at mom, who shoots him an angry look. Dad takes a bite of his Pop Tart, sinking back behind the paper. \nANGLE ON TV -- \nNEWS REPORTER The cult members have declined to an on-camera interview but did send out a note with a message. The note -- which, by the way, appears to have been written in blood -- reads... (reads the note) To the parents of Springwood -- Freddy lives! Soon he will come and take one of your children as his virgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP- and his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and -BEEP- and behold, a soulless child shall be born. The vessel for Freddy to rise and rule the darkness forever and ever. \nA horn TOOTS outside. \nMEAGAN That's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy. \nMeagan collects her books and her sister. This is dad's cue to look at his watch and say: \nMEAGAN'S DAD Oh, look at the time! I've got to be going... anyone need me to bring anything home tonight? \nMEAGAN I need an alarm clock. \nMEAGAN'S DAD What's wrong with your old one? \nMEAGAN Broke. \nMeagan kisses her dad as she and Lizzy hurry out the door.  Meagan's dad looks over at his wife, who says: \nMEAGAN'S MOM We're almost out of vodka. \nEXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nMeagan and Lizzy climb into JESSE's car. \nJESSE Good morning! Hey, what's the matter? \n", "test1_true": "JESSE And...? \nMEAGAN I had another dream last night... \nJESSE Was I naked? \nMEAGAN No. You were Jason. \nJESSE Jason? Oh, yeech... (then) Was I any good? \nMeagan playfully smacks him as Jesse's car ROARS off. \nINT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME \nMeagan's dad hesitates at the front door, clutching his keys and briefcase as he musters the courage to say something. \nMEAGAN'S DAD Do you have to watch that crap all the time? Months and months of the O.J. Simpson trial, and now this... \nMom reaches over and switches off the TV. Dad smiles slightly and exits. Mom waits until the door closes, then takes a bottle of vodka and pours a goodly bit into her orange juice.  She takes a deep drink and switches the set back on. \nCLOSE ON TV as the news reporter interviews CAPTAIN RENTON MURDOCH -- State Trooper. \nNEWS REPORTER I'm standing here with State Trooper Captain Renton Murdoch, the man the Governor has called in to deal with the cultists because of his past experience with occult-style murderers. In fact, Trooper Murdoch is the only law enforcement officer ever to survive a one-on-one encounter with notorious Camp Crystal Lake killer -- Jason Voorhees. (to Murdoch) You received some pretty nasty injuries in your battle with Jason, didn't you, Captain? \nMURDOCH Nothing serious... just a few stitches. \nNEWS REPORTER What about these so called \"Freddy\" cultists? They seem like pretty tough customers. Think you'll have any trouble getting them out of there? \nMURDOCH No. Now that the Governor has given me complete authority to deal with these punks I should be putting an end to their situation pretty quick. Unless of course their attorney is able to get them to come out peace- fully... but I don't hold out much hope for that. \nNEWS REPORTER (to camera) Captain Renton Murdoch, ladies and gentlemen. A tough cop... for tough criminals. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. \"FREDDY\" CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER \nMurdoch gets into the command car, sitting down next to the S.W.A.T. COMMANDER sitting behind the wheel. \nMURDOCH Damn media... oughtta be a law. (gestures to house) Is that shyster still in there trying to talk them out? \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER Yeah... he's making them some kind of deal. \nMURDOCH Damn lawyers... what a bunch of assholes. Shakespeare was right -- kill all the lawyers. Then we could kill all the punks with no hassles and the world would be a safer place. \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER Smaller anyway. \nMURDOCH Ahhhhh... what did Shakespeare know? Long-haired, English freak. He was probably a punk. \nINT. CULT COMPOUND - SAME TIME \nMeanwhile, inside the house... the cult's sleazy LAWYER is sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room. He is surrounded by CULTISTS -- heavily-armed teenage punks in red and olive sweaters and Fedoras ala Freddy. They stare out at him through sunglasses with red flashing diodes that barely hide their burned and disfigured faces. \nThe lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he takes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held neatly on his lap.  Then he lifts his head, wiping his nose nervously as he speaks: \nSLEAZY LAWYER So, as I explained to you before, the revenues between the TV movie deal and the book sale should be adequate to fund your joint-defense. And I think with my mass media hypnosis argument I could get each of you a reduced sentence on appeal -- say... twenty years each. Out in fifteen with good behavior? Hmmmmm? \nHARD CUT TO: \nEXT. CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER \nThe lawyer's disembodied head comes sailing out of an upstairs window, smacking into the command car's windshield with a loud SPLAT! \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER Jesus Christ! \nMurdoch curses and leaps out of the car, charging the house as he BLASTS away with two nickel-plated .45s.  Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from every window in the house, BULLET HITS RIDDLING the cops cars, SMASHING windows and emergency lights. \nThe S.W.A.T. TEAM follows Murdoch through the hail of GUNFIRE as he kicks open the front door. \nINT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT \nWHACK! -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. team move in.  The windows have been covered with foil, the walls have been painted black with cult slogans written in red, making the whole house black as pitch.  The S.W.A.T. team puts on their night vision goggles and starts moving through the house. \nP.O.V. THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES as the S.W.A.T. team goes through the house SHOOTING cultists (ala the computer game DOOM).  Then a blinding flash of light and a S.W.A.T. guy goes down -- shot in the face. \nSeveral of the cultists lead the attacking S.W.A.T. team deeper into the house.  As one of the S.W.A.T. guys follows his foot trips a wire.  A trap door opens in the floor and the S.W.A.T. guy falls into a pit, waist deep in water.  Suddenly, the water starts churning and the guy starts screaming -- it's a tank of piranhas!  Two other S.W.A.T. guys grab his arms and pull him out.  Too late -- his legs have been shredded to the bone. \nAnother S.W.A.T. guy kicks in a door to a room and steps in, FIRING his machine gun.  A large scythe swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows. His arms fall to the floor, still FIRING the machine gun. \n", "test1_id": 2532, "test2_input": "STORMIE One thing... he used to be a Democrat. Now he votes straight Republican. \nMEAGAN I think he thinks Lizzy joined the cult or something. \nSTORMIE Oh, my God... he'll kill her. \nMEAGAN I've got to find Lizzy myself. I've got to find her and save her from Freddy before that crazy cop kills her. \nJESSE Just where are you going to look? I mean, these cult guys could be holding her anywhere. \nMEAGAN Murdoch said something about going to talk to somebody named Erwin. \nSTORMIE Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the Freddy cult! I bet he knows where they took Lizzy! \nJESSE Not Squirmin' Erwin -- that freak that used to eat bugs? \nSTORMIE (annoyed) Who else? (to Meagan; bright) Erwin is scary smart -- always brought home \"A\"s -- but he was kinda fucked up, too... I mean, who isn't really? Anyway, he quit the cult a few months back and the cops put him away for his own safety. They say Freddy's put a death hex on Erwin. \nJESSE A death hex? \nSTORMIE Yes, a death hex. You know... where someone wants you dead! \nMEAGAN Where is he? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON \nJesse, Meagan, and Stormie pull past the large sign and into the parking lot.  As Jesse puts the car in park, Meagan turns to him and says: \nMEAGAN I want you to stay here. \nJESSE Why? \nMEAGAN Don't be mad... it's just that you might scare him. \nJESSE Scare him? \nSTORMIE What she's subtly trying to tell you is that this needs a woman's gentle touch... butthead. \nMEAGAN Just stay here... okay? \nJesse grudgingly agrees.  Meagan kisses Jesse on the cheek.  Stormie sticks her tongue out at him, then turns as she and Meagan walk toward the main entrance. \nINT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER \nThe CRIES of the insane echo through the building as the SECURITY GUARD escorts Meagan and Stormie down a row of cell doors.  He stops at one, tapping lightly on the glass. \nSECURITY GUARD Yo, Erwin... you've got a couple of visitors. Now be a good boy... (to Meagan & Stormie) You've got five minutes. I'll be right down the hall if you need me. \nThe guard exits.  Meagan and Stormie peer through the thick window -- Erwin's padded cell appears vacant. They exchange anxious looks, then Meagan presses a little closer to the glass. \nMEAGAN Erwin...? \nSPLAT! -- ERWIN suddenly presses his horribly burned face to the glass as he screams: \nERWIN SHOW ME YOUR ARMS! YOUR ARMS! \nMeagan and Stormie jump back, startled.  Then they quickly bare their arms, turning them over for Erwin's inspection. \nERWIN (continuing) Where do you shoot? \nMEAGAN Shoot? \nSTORMIE He's talking about dream dope -- the stuff the cultists shoot up with so they can talk to Freddy. \nMEAGAN I don't do drugs. \nERWIN You're not in the cult? \nMEAGAN No. \nERWIN Didn't Freddy send you to kill me? \nMEAGAN/STORMIE No. \nERWIN I don't trust you... better take off your clothes so I can check you for tracks. \n", "test2_true": "Erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket, gesturing to the inside of his cell -- empty except for a small mattress. \nERWIN Well, what do you want? Can't you see I'm busy? \nMEAGAN Freddy's cult kidnapped my sister. \nSTORMIE I told her you might know where they took her. \nERWIN I already told the cops everything I know. \nMEAGAN Tell me... please. \nERWIN Look... I'm sorry about your sister, but I've got my own problems with Freddy. I'm a marked man, you know. \nMEAGAN Then tell me why they took her... \nERWIN To bear his child. Freddy wants to be human again. In order to do that he has to be \"reborn\". \nMEAGAN How can he do that? \nERWIN He has to marry a virgin on holy ground. Then the cult consumate the marriage by impregnating her. \nSTORMIE The whole cult? Yeech! \nERWIN Freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs. It's sort of a tradition with him. \nMEAGAN So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant? \nERWIN And Freddy enters the soul of the fetus through a dream state. Voila! Rebirth. \nThere is a moment as the girls take this in, then: \nSTORMIE That's the stupidest shit I ever heard. \nERWIN Hey, they're not my rules... some- body else wrote 'em. \nMEAGAN Erwin... you've got to help me find Lizzy. You're my only hope. \nErwin thinks about this for a second, then: \nERWIN I'll help you find your sister, but you've got to help me. \nMEAGAN Anything. Just name it. \nERWIN You have to help me kill Freddy. \nMeagan and Stormie exchange looks. \nSTORMIE But Freddy's dead. \nERWIN Freddy lives... (looks at Meagan) If only in our dreams. \nStormie grabs Meagan by the arm and starts to pull her away. \nSTORMIE Come on, Meagan... our five minutes is up. He's giving me the creeps. \nBut Meagan stays put and asks Erwin: \nMEAGAN How can you kill a dream? \nERWIN When it's not a dream. (then) Do we have a deal? \nErwin presses his palm against the glass.  Meagan thinks a moment, then puts her hand against the glass over his. \nMEAGAN Deal. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOON - A SHORT TIME LATER \nMeagan, Jesse, and Stormie are standing in front of a pay phone, arguing. \nJESSE No! I won't do it! \nMEAGAN Come on, Jesse! Please...? \nJESSE It's illegal! I could go to jail! \n", "test2_id": 2533, "test3_input": "ERWIN I can't wake them up. Freddy's got them trapped! \nErwin thinks for a moment, then rushes over to a couple of dead cultists.  He takes their syringes. Erwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full of dream dope. \nERWIN (continuing) Go get him, boy! \nJason staggers forward, falling into... \nINT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nJason falls into a boxing arena.  The ropes are entrails and atop each corner post is mounted a human head.  The spectators are all DEMONS, MONSTERS, and the LIVING DEAD. \nJason looks over at his opponent -- dressed in boxing shorts, shoes, and gloves -- it's Freddy. \nJason raises his arms and finds he too is wearing boxing gloves. \nTED BUNDY steps into the ring. \nTED BUNDY (into microphone) Ladies and gentlemen... welcome to the fight of the century! I'm your ring announcer... Ted Bundy! \nBANG! -- a bullet hole appears in Ted's forehead, BLOWING his brains out the back.  He falls over DEAD and the crowd cheers.  Ted sits up and pulls the wig back over his shaved head and electric burns as he calls into the balcony: \nTED BUNDY (continuing) Verrrrrry funny, Oswald! \nANGLE IN BALCONY -- OSWALD stands, his rifle still smoking. \nOSWALD (angry; defensive) It wasn't me! \nTed Bundy gets to his feet and finishes the intro: \nTED BUNDY In my left corner, weighing in at only ninety seven pounds... the nightmare master himself! The one! The only... Freddddddddy Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr!!! \nFreddy holds up his arms and the crowd goes wild. \nTED BUNDY (continuing) And on my right... weighing in at a whopping four hundred and thir- teen pounds... that killer of countless teenagers... the big guy... (gestures to Jason) Jason Voorhees! \nCHEERS and BOOS. \nTED BUNDY (continuing) And the prize tonight... not one but TWO -- count 'em -- TWO virgins... ripe for the picking. \nTed gestures to a large cage suspended over the arena. Inside -- Meagan and Lizzy clutch eachother. \nTED BUNDY (continuing) Hey, have one now and save the other for the ride home. That's what I did. \nLAUGHTER from the crowd. \nMEAGAN Kick his ass, Jason! \nDING! -- the bell sounds.  The first round begins... \nFreddy starts towards Jason, cocking his glove for a blow when -- CH-CHING! -- knife blades jut out of the glove.  He punches Jason in the stomach and starts RIPPING him open, rotten guts spilling out. \nJason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an axe in her head.  This is BLOODY MARY.  Jason reaches over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of her head.  Bloody Mary whips around, yelling: \nBLOODY MARY HEY! \nJason swings with the axe -- SH-WACK! -- Jason SLICES OFF Freddy's arm.  The crowd ROARS.  Freddy looks down at the open armpit, GUSHING with ROTTEN BLOOD, and shrugs: \nFREDDY Oh, well... I just axed for that! \nFreddy GROWS a new arm, complete with glove of knives. Jason throws the axe at Freddy, who ducks it.  The axe flies into the audience, SMACKING MUSSOLINI square between the eyes.  He falls back to the floor.  HITLER turns to EVA BRAUN and says disdainfully: \nHITLER Peasants... \nDING!  The bell sounds.  Freddy and Jason break, going into their respective corners.  As Jason sits down in his corner, the HUMAN HEAD mounted on his corner post starts in: \nHUMAN HEAD That's it, kiddo! You're really giving it to him out there! Use the left more -- jab! Make him hurt! That's the ticket to a knockout! \nUp in her cage, Meagan clutches a terrifed Lizzy. \nINT. STUDIO - SAME TIME \nErwin watches Jason sleep as the cultists BANG down the studio door. \nINT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT MOMENT \nDING!  The bell sounds again and round two begins. Freddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on each other.  Jason swings wide.  Freddy ducks under Jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for a close look.  WHUMP -- Jason knocks the ref's head OFF, it goes flying up into the balcony.  The crowd CHEERS. \n", "test3_true": "Up in their cage, Meagan and Lizzy grimace with disgust. \nJason reaches down and grabs Freddy, hoisting him high above his head.  Then Jason body slams Freddy to the mat.  The crowd CHEERS. \nJason starts jumping up and down on Freddy's back. Freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty can of spinach.  In a grotesque parody of Popeye he opens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots -- and gulps it down.  Suddenly, Freddy throws Jason off his back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his chest and arms.  At the end of his right hand -- a heavy metal boxing glove. \nJason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the massive glove for a blow. \nCHING! -- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal glove.  Freddy swings, knocking Jason into the ropes. He bounces off and falls to the mat.  The fans go nuts. \nAs Jason tries to get up, Freddy swings his right arm around and around -- the metal boxing glove turning into a giant mallet.  Jason looks up just in time to see the mallet coming down.  WHAM! -- Freddy drives Jason into the mat.  The crowd goes wild. \n>From up in her cage, Meagan starts to scream: \nMEAGAN Jason! Get up! Get up! \nANGLE UNDER THE MAT -- it's a dark, foreboding (under- water) abyss.  Jason's legs kick, trying to get back up.  Something slithers up from out of the deep... wisps of empty blackness clutching at Jason's boots. \nFreddy pushes down on Jason's mask, shoving him down. Jason struggles but keeps slipping.  This looks like the end of Jason.  Freddy laughs. \nMEAGAN (continuing) Jason! You've got to get up! \nJASON'S P.O.V. of Freddy looking down at him, pushing him down... drowning him... \nFLASH CUT TO: \nEXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY \nYOUNG JASON P.O.V. as he is being drowned.  He fights to get to the surface... to see... who it is... \nYoung Jason breaks the surface for an instant and his killer comes into sharp focus. \nIt's FREDDY (AGE 13).  His Camp Crystal Lake nametag reads:  Hi! My name is Freddy!  He pushes the young Jason down again, laughing. \nHARD CUT TO: \nINT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT INSTANT \nFreddy pushes Jason down into the abyss below the mat... laughing, when Jason snaps.  With a burst of strength he kicks upward, coming up out of the mat.  Jason grabs Freddy by the throat and seizes him up with him. \nJason's momentum carries both of them up to the ceiling, where they CRASH through to... \nINT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nJason \"wakes up\", holding Freddy by the throat as he bangs his head into the lighting gridwork above the studio.  A light EXPLODES and Freddy cries in pain... then realizes, he's been brought into the real world. \nFREDDY Oh, shit! \nJason throws Freddy to the ground, then raises up a boot and stomps Freddy's head, SQUASHING it like a tomato.  The Dream Demons squirt out. \nJust then, the cultists BREAK DOWN the studio door. They raise their weapons to fire, when their heads suddenly IMPLODE.  They fall screaming to the floor -- dead. \nEXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT - SAME INSTANT \nThe remaining cultists SHOOTING it out with the police suddenly grab their heads, screaming.  Their heads IMPLODE and they fall to the ground.  Murdoch sees this and says to the S.W.A.T. commander: \nMURDOCH Now's my chance... give me sixty seconds to get in there then move in. \nBefore the commander can reply, Murdoch is off and running into the station. \nINT. STUDIO - SAME TIME \nMeagan and Lizzy come out of their sleep-like trance and embrace.  Then Meagan looks up at Erwin. \nMEAGAN What took you so long?! \nErwin gestures to Jason, trying to keep his voice low so as to not hurt the big guy's feelings. \nERWIN What ever you do... don't let this guy drive. \nMeagan smiles at Jason. \nMEAGAN I knew you would come... \nJason and Meagan look over to where Freddy's body is fast decaying... turning back into blackened bones, scraps of cloth, and a rusting glove of knives. \nThe Dream Demons squirm around on the studio floor, then swim into the open end of the camera cable and disappear. \n", "test3_id": 2534}

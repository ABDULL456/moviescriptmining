{"train": "\"NIGHTMARE 13: FREDDY MEETS JASON\" -- unproduced, by Lewis Abernathy \nNIGHTMARE 13 -- FREDDY MEETS JASON \nby Lewis Abernathy \nFADE IN: \nEXT. ELM STREET - DAY \nMEAGAN is coming down the sidewalk in slow motion. Her dress and long hair blow slightly in the breeze. The SOUND of CHILDREN CHANTING increases. \nDREAM CHILDREN (in chorus) One... two... Freddy's coming for you. \nOn \"you\" there is a RUMBLE and a flash -- like quick lightning only evil.  (Choice flashes from Nightmare on Elm Street 1 & 2). \nMeagan turns at 1665.  A beautiful white, two-story house, thick with lush green foliage.  Several beautiful children, all dressed in bright white, play hopscotch and jumprope on the front walk. \nDREAM CHILDREN (continuing; chanting) Three... four... better lock your door. \nClose on a little girl's foot coming down on the number \"4\" drawn on concrete. \nAnother RUMBLE and flash -- longer, LOUDER.  (Flashes from Nightmare 3 & 4). \nMeagan continues up the walk, the wind is blowing a little harder now.  The trees are brown, the leaves peeling away. \nMoving up the walk, closer to the house... only now it's a little darker, needs some paint.  On the front porch, a LITTLE GIRL rides a tricycle. \nDREAM CHILDREN (continuing; chanting) Five... six... \nRUMBLE.  Flash.  (Nightmare 5 and Freddy's Dead). \nDREAM CHILDREN (continuing; chanting) ...grab your crucifix.. ix.. ix.. \nThe \"ix\" echoes away, becoming the faint \"Ka ka ka\" we all recognize as Jason's theme.  Meagan turns to find that the children in the yard have vanished. It's nighttime. \nThe trees are dead, the grass is gone, and the horizon stretches off into utter nothingness.  Meagan turns back to the little girl. \nBut the little girl has gone.  Only the tricycle remains.  It circles once, the front door CREAKS open, and the empty tricycle peddles inside.  Meagan follows it into the... \nINT. HOUSE ON ELM STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nMeagan enters the house slowly, watching as the tri- cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears. Then the front door blows shut behind Meagan.  She tries to open it -- locked. \nThen faint VOICES cause Meagan to pause.  She listens, trying to make out the low murmur.  Then a little girl's GIGGLE.  Meagan recognizes it as her sister's. \nMEAGAN Lizzy? \nMeagan moves up the stairs, going down the hall... following the voices (we recognize the other voice as belonging to Freddy).  Meagan enters a door at the end of the hallway, moving into... \nINT. LIZZY'S ROOM (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINOUS ACTION \nOn the floor, near her bed, is Meagan's thirteen year old sister -- LIZZY.  Slow for her age, Lizzy sits and draws with crayons. \nMEAGAN Lizzy. What are you doing here? \nLIZZY Playing with my friend. \nMeagan looks at the drawings -- childlike renderings of Freddy. \nMEAGAN Your friend? \nLIZZY He lives under the bed. \nMeagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under Lizzy's bed. \nSuddenly, a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under the bed, flashing past Meagan's face and running out the door.  Meagan yelps and touches her face -- five tiny slash marks on her cheek.  Lizzy clucks. \nLIZZY (continuing) You scared him... \nMeagan looks out the door, incredulous. \nMEAGAN I scared him? \nBut when Meagan looks back, Lizzy is gone. \nMEAGAN (continuing) Lizzy? \nLIZZY I was scared. \nMEAGAN Don't worry... they can't hurt you. \nLIZZY Promise? \nMEAGAN Promise. \nLizzy hugs Meagan. \nMEAGAN (continuing) I'll never let anyone hurt you. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nCLOSE ON a small television set on the kitchen table. A flashy graphic flashes across the screen: AM NEWS SPECIAL REPORT -- COPS V.S. THE CULT -- DAY 13.  A NEWS REPORTER stands in front a police blockade. In the background, dozens of POLICE and S.W.A.T. MEN surround a small run-down, two-story house... Freddy's house. \nNEWS REPORTER (filtered) As the sun rises on yet another morning, still no end in sight for the standoff between police and the mysterious group known only as the \"Freddy\" cult who seized the abandoned house behind me just thirteen days ago.  These cultists -- mostly run- away teenagers -- have managed to keep police at bay for almost two weeks while inside they take mind- altering narcotics in order to communicate with their god -- Freddy. \nThe reporter babbles on as Meagan enters the kitchen where MEAGAN'S MOM is sitting watching the TV, gulping down orange juice.  Across from mom is MEAGAN'S DAD, who is having coffee, reading the paper.  Meagan pours herself a cup and sits. \nMEAGAN Morning. \nMeagan's mom grunts, transfixed on the news.  Dad looks over his paper long enough to smile and say, just a little too cheerfully: \nMEAGAN'S DAD Morning, Meagan. \nMeagan looks over at her mother, then back at her father, mouthing the words \"How's mom?\", when suddenly Meagan's mom bellows: \nMEAGAN'S MOM (calls upstairs) Lizzy! Get down here! Breakfast is almost ready! \nMeagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back into his paper.  Meagan sighs and sips her coffee. \nANGLE ON TV -- a police booking photo of FRED KRUEGER. \nNEWS REPORTER Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger was released on a legal technicality but later burned to death at the hands of a vigilante mob of grieving parents.  Some years later, a rash of bizarre and unexplainable teen- age deaths began leaving many in the area to wonder... is Freddy really dead? \nMeagan's younger sister -- LIZZY -- comes down to breakfast.  The microwave DINGS and Meagan's mom pulls out three Pop Tarts, dealing them out to her family like playing cards.  Lizzy picks up her Pop Tart, whining. \nMEAGAN'S MOM Hurry up and eat. You don't want to be late for special school. \nMEAGAN Mom! Don't call it that! \nLIZZY I hate that school. The other kids are mean... and they're all re- tard-ed! \nMeagan snickers. \nMEAGAN'S MOM We don't use that word. They're \"special\" children just like you're \"special\". \nDad looks over at mom, who shoots him an angry look. Dad takes a bite of his Pop Tart, sinking back behind the paper. \nANGLE ON TV -- \nNEWS REPORTER The cult members have declined to an on-camera interview but did send out a note with a message. The note -- which, by the way, appears to have been written in blood -- reads... (reads the note) To the parents of Springwood -- Freddy lives! Soon he will come and take one of your children as his virgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP- and his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and -BEEP- and behold, a soulless child shall be born. The vessel for Freddy to rise and rule the darkness forever and ever. \nA horn TOOTS outside. \nMEAGAN That's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy. \nMeagan collects her books and her sister. This is dad's cue to look at his watch and say: \nMEAGAN'S DAD Oh, look at the time! I've got to be going... anyone need me to bring anything home tonight? \nMEAGAN I need an alarm clock. \nMEAGAN'S DAD What's wrong with your old one? \nMEAGAN Broke. \nMeagan kisses her dad as she and Lizzy hurry out the door.  Meagan's dad looks over at his wife, who says: \nMEAGAN'S MOM We're almost out of vodka. \nEXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nMeagan and Lizzy climb into JESSE's car. \nJESSE Good morning! Hey, what's the matter? \nThe cultists race into a room, grabbing handrailing bolted over head.  They swing like monkeys across the ceiling just as a S.W.A.T. guy charges into the room behind them. \nCLOSE ON S.W.A.T. GUY'S BOOTS as he steps onto a floor covered with upturned nails.  Several nails puncture both boots, the points coming up through the laces. The S.W.A.T. guy screams and another S.W.A.T. guy barrels into the room to see what is wrong.  He knocks the first guy face-first into the floor o' nails. \nMeanwhile, Murdoch is having a blast -- literally. He kicks open the door to a room and guns down three cultists as they try to escape out a window.  As the last body pitches to the floor, Murdoch yells: \nMURDOCH Freeze! \nMurdoch exits, laughing to himself. \nThe running GUNBATTLE continues as the cultists retreat to the back of the house, throwing molotov cocktails.  Soon the first floor is ablaze. A S.W.A.T. guy screams as he is consumed by FIRE.  The cultists thunder down a back staircase to the... \nINT. THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nThe cultists uncover a secret passageway under the house and most escape through the underground tunnel just before the S.W.A.T. team comes BLASTING into the basement.  As the last of the remaining cultists is capped off, a faint voice cries for help.  The S.W.A.T. commander raises up his hand. \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER Hold your fire! \nHe pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his flashlight into the basement.  Through the dense smoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied to a chair sitting on a crate.  Underneath the chair -- several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer. CLOSE ON THE TIMER: 30... 29... 28... \nLITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE Help me, mister... please. \nThe S.W.A.T. commander rushes to the girl, kneeling down to look at the bomb.  Then he takes a Leatherman tool from his vest and starts to work on the bomb's timer. \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER Hang on, honey... I'll have you out of there in a second. \nMurdoch comes down the stairs.  He goes to the secret passageway and says: \nMURDOCH Looks like we'll have to hunt the rest of them down. Let's go before they get too far. \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER We can't leave! Can't you see we've got a situation here? \nMurdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs. \nMURDOCH Leave her. \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER You're crazy! I can't just leave her! \nMURDOCH Forget it. I've seen this before. There's nothing you can do. \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER I've got to try... \nThe S.W.A.T. commander wipes his brow and leans in to work on the bomb again.  CLOSE ON TIMER: 24... \nThe basement ceiling is now fully ABLAZE and chunks of BURNING DEBRIS fall around the skittish S.W.A.T. team.  Murdoch looks at his watch in a bored fashion. \nMURDOCH You're wasting your time. \nThe S.W.A.T. commander studies the wires for another second, then glances back at the timer... 15... 14... \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER Fuck it! \nThe S.W.A.T. commander whips out his Spyderco knife and cuts the little girl loose.  He carries her out in his arms as he shouts to his men: \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER (continuing; yelling) CLEAR OUT! SHE'S GOIN' BLOW!!! \nThe S.W.A.T. team exits the basement with Murdoch bringing up the rear. \nEXT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT \nThe S.W.A.T. commander staggers out with the little girl, followed closely with the remainder of his men and finally Murdoch.  The commander throws himself to the ground, covering the little girl with his body as -- BA-BOOM!!! -- the Elm Street house EXPLODES! \nMurdoch stands as debris rains down around him.  He mutters: \nMURDOCH Punks. \nAs the dust settles, the S.W.A.T. commander rolls off the little girl and starts checking her for injury. \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER Are you okay, honey? \nSuddenly, the little girl jumps onto the S.W.A.T. commander, flashing a glove of knives.  She hisses: \nLITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE Freddy lives! \nWith a quick swing, the little girl slashes the commander's face.  She dives back for a plunge to his throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off. He puts his boot on her, holding her down as he takes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution style. \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER NO! \nPHOOMPH!!! -- the flash bulb goes off with an atomic light.  Meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back against the blackboard -- vaporized! \nHARD CUT TO: \nMeagan waking up in her seat suddenly.  The classroom as normal.  Miss Krepps is standing over her, asking: \nMISS KREPPS Meagan? Meagan?! \nMeagan looks around, bewildered and confused. \nMISS KREPPS (continuing) I asked if you were ready to give your report? \nMeagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls herself together. \nMEAGAN Sure... \nMeagan stands up and faints. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SCHOOL NURSE'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER \nMEAGAN'S P.O.V as the SCHOOL NURSE comes into FOCUS, standing over her. \nSCHOOL NURSE Meagan? Can you hear me? Do you know where you are? \nMeagan is laying on a couch, a cloth over her head. \nMEAGAN I was day dreaming and then I woke up but then it was like I was still dreaming and then I woke up and then I guess I fainted and now I'm awake again... \nSCHOOL NURSE Are you sure? \nMeagan stares at the nurse for a moment. \nSCHOOL NURSE (continuing) Meagan? \nMEAGAN I'm waiting to see if you're going to turn into Freddy. \nSCHOOL NURSE Freddy... I see. You've been watching too much CNN. That crazy \"Freddy\" cult thing -- it's all over the TV day and night -- you can't get away from it. No wonder you kids are all having nightmares. \nMEAGAN But this one was different... it felt real. \nSCHOOL NURSE But that's just it, Meagan... dreams aren't real. They're just broken fragments of the subconscious mind. \nMEAGAN Fear is real though, isn't it? And if nightmares are fear, then doesn't that make them real?! (gets excited) And if the nightmares are real then is reality like a dream?! \nSCHOOL NURSE (cutting her off) Meagan! You've got heat prostration... that's all. \nThe nurse slaps a wet towel over her face. \nINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nJesse is waiting for Meagan as she emerges from the nurse's office, muttering under her breath: \nMEAGAN Old witch... what does she know? She isn't even qualified to give a shot and she's telling me that my dreams aren't anything to worry about. \nJESSE So she said you were okay? \nMEAGAN Oh, sure... Madame Curie in there says it's just a case of heat pro- stration and an overdose of TV news. Ruined my makeup, too. \nJESSE So you're going back to class? \nMEAGAN No. She gave me last period off. \nJESSE Well, what are you bitching about? I could have a compound fracture of the skull and she wouldn't excuse me from P.E. \nMEAGAN Jesse! I've been having nightmares for almost two weeks now and they keep getting worse! Now I'm having daymares! I want to know why! \nJESSE Okay... well, didn't the nurse say it was heat probation? \nMeagan rolls her eyes in frustration. \nMEAGAN You don't understand... I want to know more about dreams. What they mean... why we have them. \nJESSE Okay, Meg, go look it up. You've got the rest of the day off, that's all I'm saying. \nMEAGAN That's a good idea. Why don't you cut last period and come with me? \nLIZZY No they won't, because I'm walkin' home! \nLizzy gets to her feet and starts walking.  Leonard calls after her: \nLEONARD Come back, Lizzy! You can wait with me! I got forgot too, you know! \nLizzy keeps going, marching across the deserted school yard.  Leonard turns to go inside the school when he bumps into a passing CULTIST.  The cultist pushes him down as he follows after Lizzy. \nLEONARD (continuing) Okay... I'm going to have to report this! \nLizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling she's being followed.  She turns and sees a cultist standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her. Lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she glances back, the figure is still standing... but closer. \nScared, Lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as she flees down the sidewalk.  As she comes to the street, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front of her, the door swinging open wide.  Burned arms reach out to grab Lizzy.  She screams. \nThe cultists grab Lizzy, pulling her into the car as it roars off down the street. \nCLOSE ON RAGGEDY ANN -- laying in the gutter. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nJesse's car pulls up to a sea of police cars parked in front of Meagan's house.  Meagan gets out of the car and rushes inside. \nINT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nCOPS are everywhere as Meagan bursts into the house, calling for her family.  Jesse enters behind her when Meagan's dad comes up, asking: \nMEAGAN'S DAD Didn't you get my message? \nMEAGAN What message? \nMEAGAN'S DAD I called the school after lunch... I had to stay late after work... I... \nMeagan's mother bellows from the living room where she is talking to a policeman taking notes.  She is drunk and has been crying. \nMEAGAN'S MOM Don't you dare blame this on her, you sorry bastard! It's all your fault! (to Meagan) Where have you been anyway? \nMEAGAN The library. \nMEAGAN'S MOM A likely Goddamn story! \nMeagan's mom breaks down sobbing. \nMEAGAN Dad... what's wrong? What's happened? Where's Lizzy? \nMEAGAN'S DAD She didn't come home from school today. The police got a report that a girl fitting Lizzy's description was forced into a car by some crazies. They're pretty sure it was this \"Freddy\" cult. \nMEAGAN (shocked) Oh, my God... \nMeagan's dad puts his arm around Meagan and tries to comfort her. \nMEAGAN'S DAD Now don't worry. The police are doing everything they can. \nMeagan looks over and sees Murdoch talking to his men when a voice from upstairs calls down: \nTROOPER (O.S.) Hey, Cap'n... better have a look up here! \nINT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NEXT SECOND \nAs Murdoch enters, he spots Lizzy's night table and the small glass menagerie there.  Murdoch picks up the unicorn and admires it when a TROOPER draws his attention to the floor next to the bed. \nLaying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy, including one that has \"Freddy Lives\" scrawled across the top. \nMeagan enters and sees the drawings.  She gasps. \nTROOPER Looks like she was in the cult all along. \nMEAGAN No... no, she wouldn't do that! Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult! \nTROOPER I know it's hard to believe, miss. But a lot of good kids get caught up in this kind of trouble. \nMurdoch stares at the drawings, his jaw muscles tightening.  He clenches his fist, pulverizing the little unicorn. \nMURDOCH Punks... \nMurdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on the table as he exits the room, brushing past Meagan. \nSTORMIE One thing... he used to be a Democrat. Now he votes straight Republican. \nMEAGAN I think he thinks Lizzy joined the cult or something. \nSTORMIE Oh, my God... he'll kill her. \nMEAGAN I've got to find Lizzy myself. I've got to find her and save her from Freddy before that crazy cop kills her. \nJESSE Just where are you going to look? I mean, these cult guys could be holding her anywhere. \nMEAGAN Murdoch said something about going to talk to somebody named Erwin. \nSTORMIE Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the Freddy cult! I bet he knows where they took Lizzy! \nJESSE Not Squirmin' Erwin -- that freak that used to eat bugs? \nSTORMIE (annoyed) Who else? (to Meagan; bright) Erwin is scary smart -- always brought home \"A\"s -- but he was kinda fucked up, too... I mean, who isn't really? Anyway, he quit the cult a few months back and the cops put him away for his own safety. They say Freddy's put a death hex on Erwin. \nJESSE A death hex? \nSTORMIE Yes, a death hex. You know... where someone wants you dead! \nMEAGAN Where is he? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON \nJesse, Meagan, and Stormie pull past the large sign and into the parking lot.  As Jesse puts the car in park, Meagan turns to him and says: \nMEAGAN I want you to stay here. \nJESSE Why? \nMEAGAN Don't be mad... it's just that you might scare him. \nJESSE Scare him? \nSTORMIE What she's subtly trying to tell you is that this needs a woman's gentle touch... butthead. \nMEAGAN Just stay here... okay? \nJesse grudgingly agrees.  Meagan kisses Jesse on the cheek.  Stormie sticks her tongue out at him, then turns as she and Meagan walk toward the main entrance. \nINT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER \nThe CRIES of the insane echo through the building as the SECURITY GUARD escorts Meagan and Stormie down a row of cell doors.  He stops at one, tapping lightly on the glass. \nSECURITY GUARD Yo, Erwin... you've got a couple of visitors. Now be a good boy... (to Meagan & Stormie) You've got five minutes. I'll be right down the hall if you need me. \nThe guard exits.  Meagan and Stormie peer through the thick window -- Erwin's padded cell appears vacant. They exchange anxious looks, then Meagan presses a little closer to the glass. \nMEAGAN Erwin...? \nSPLAT! -- ERWIN suddenly presses his horribly burned face to the glass as he screams: \nERWIN SHOW ME YOUR ARMS! YOUR ARMS! \nMeagan and Stormie jump back, startled.  Then they quickly bare their arms, turning them over for Erwin's inspection. \nERWIN (continuing) Where do you shoot? \nMEAGAN Shoot? \nSTORMIE He's talking about dream dope -- the stuff the cultists shoot up with so they can talk to Freddy. \nMEAGAN I don't do drugs. \nERWIN You're not in the cult? \nMEAGAN No. \nERWIN Didn't Freddy send you to kill me? \nMEAGAN/STORMIE No. \nERWIN I don't trust you... better take off your clothes so I can check you for tracks. \nMEAGAN What should we do? \nERWIN Have a seat over there and make yourselves comfortable. Roll up your sleeves and put these on... \nErwin hands Meagan and Stormie each a pair of the sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens. Stormie puts hers on immediately and says: \nSTORMIE Oh, cool! \nMEAGAN What are they for? \nERWIN It's how the cult keeps in constant contact with Freddy. The little lights flashing are a sustained occular input that causes your brain to resonate at approximately the same frequency at which the dream state is most likely to occur. \nAll of this went over Meagan's head.  Stormie shrugs: \nSTORMIE Whatever... (to Meagan; excited) Put 'em on -- they're really cool! \nMeagan and Stormie sit down in easy chairs, rolling up their sleeves.  Erwin comes over and reclines the chairs, giving each girl an injection.  Then Erwin takes a seat next to Meagan and injects himself.  He lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his glasses. \nERWIN It helps to hold hands if you want to go together... \nMeagan clasps hands with Erwin and Stormie.  Jesse watches with skepticism and concern.  Erwin ushers a final warning: \nERWIN (continuing) And remember... Freddy knows what scares you. \nThen all three FALL THROUGH their chairs into... \nINT. DREAMSPACE - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nMeagan, Stormie, and Erwin falling through dreamspace (fantastic digital effect tunnel), still holding hands. The girls scream as Erwin smiles and yells: \nERWIN WHAT A RUSH, HUH?!! \nINT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME \nJesse watches over Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin -- all asleep in their chairs. \nINT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT \nMeagan, Stormie, and Erwin fall into a crazy night- mare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy pictures) with rusty catwalks, huge out-of-proportion fixtures above and a sea of boiling water below.  As they get to their feet, Meagan hears Lizzy's voice: \nLIZZY (distant) Meagan... help me... please... \nMeagan enters a shaft, following the sound when suddenly, the shaft closes up behind her.  Stormie and Erwin try to find the opening again but can't. \nERWIN Freddy's trying to split us up... \nINT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME \nJesse is standing in front of an old, full length mirror, practicing drawing the pistol.  He pulls it and pretends to fire, blowing imaginary smoke from the muzzle as he says: \nJESSE Okay, Freddy... there's a new sheriff in Dreamland now. \nINT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT \nStormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy boiler room, calling for Meagan.  A strange shadow stalks them -- it's Freddy.  He drops down in front of Erwin and Stormie. \nFREDDY Looking for some-body? \nFreddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of lost souls.  In the center -- Meagan.  Stormie charges Freddy, throwing her arms around him as she screams to Erwin: \nSTORMIE I've got him! Wake us up! Wake us up! \nBut Erwin is paralyzed with fear. \nSTORMIE (continuing) Don't just stand there! Wake us up! \nFREDDY Hmmmmm... I feel like seafood tonight. \nSuddenly, Stormie's arms have become huge lobster claws.  She jerks away from Freddy, but too late -- Stormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman! Freddy smiles -- now he's wearing a chef's hat and apron. \nFREDDY (continuing) Stew on this, bitch! \nFreddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side.  She falls into the boiling water far below -- KER-SPLASH! \nHARD CUT TO: \nINT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT \nSTORMIE He killed me, too. But look... \nStormie raises her shirt up to show Meagan she is unharmed.  Erwin sneaks a look and Stormie smacks him. Meagan gets to her feet, asking: \nMEAGAN Now that I think about it -- he's killed me in all my nightmares. But I'm not dead... what does it mean? \nERWIN It means we've still got some time left. Until his remains are host to the Dream Demons -- Freddy can't hurt us. \nJESSE Hello. The Dream Demons...? \nERWIN Freddy made a pact with Satan when he died... so Satan bestowed upon him the Dream Demons. They're the source of Freddy's power to manipulate our physical reality. Without them... he's powerless -- nothing more than a bad dream. (off Jesse's cynical look) Hey, like I said... I don't make the rules. \nMEAGAN But we've still got a chance, right? A chance to kill Freddy before he gets back his power? \nERWIN We already tried that. There's no way for us to kill Freddy. He's too clever. He knows how to get to us. \nMEAGAN Then let's get somebody else. Some- body strong. \nSTORMIE Yeah! We could hire somebody to kill Freddy -- like a hit man! \nERWIN You would have to hire a thousand of them... or one really big guy who isn't afraid of anything. No fear. Nada. Then you got a shot. \nJESSE Where are you going to find a hit man? The yellow pages? In your dreams... \nJesse's last three words strike Meagan like a thunder- bolt and she stammers out a name: \nMEAGAN Jason... \nJESSE Jason? \nMEAGAN Jason Voorhees... \nERWIN (brightens) Jason Voorhees... that's brilliant! The perfect dream warrior... no fear. \nSTORMIE Sounds like our man! \nJESSE Uh... excuse me, Einstein... but isn't Jason Voorhees dead? \nERWIN Seriously dead. Buried up by Crystal Lake somewhere. But don't worry, I know how to bring him back to life. \nJESSE Somehow I just knew you would. \nERWIN But that's not the problem. The problem is control. Once we bring Jason back from the dead... I'm not one hundred percent sure he'll do what we tell him. \nSTORMIE Well, that's okay... as long as he doesn't chop us all up. \nErwin rolls his eyes around -- uncertain. \nMEAGAN Erwin... I'm trusting you on this, so tell me the truth. Do you think if we do this -- if we go and get Jason and bring him back to life, that he could kill Freddy? \nERWIN No doubt about. Jason could wreck Freddy on this side of the Dreamline. But if Freddy has home court advan- tage... I don't know. Too close to call. The trick would be to get Jason to enter a dream state, grab Freddy, and drag him out to our reality. \nMEAGAN I haven't got a choice. I've got to try something... (turns to Stormie & Jesse) I can't ask either of you to help me do this... it's illegal, immoral, disgusting... \nSTORMIE Hey, we sisters have to stand together, right? Where you lead -- I'll follow. Count me in. \nMeagan embraces Stormie, then all three turn to Jesse. He looks them over and sighs: \nJESSE Let me get this straight... we're going to go dig one dead maniac up to fight another dead maniac? \nERWIN That's about the size of it... and I'd be doing you a disservice if I said there weren't a modicum of risk involved. \nJESSE Meagan... I don't want to do this... \nMEAGAN You don't have to, Jesse... it's not your fight. I understand. \nJESSE But I damn sure don't want you to do it without me. Count me in. \nMeagan hugs Jesse.  Erwin tries to hug Stormie but she pushes him away. \nERWIN Look out Freddy... here we come. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - NIGHT \nIn his shack, listening to a small portable radio, is the NIGHT WATCHMAN.  His small DOG suddenly perks up her ears and GROWLS low.  The watchman turns down the radio. \nCRAZY OL' COOT You're not goin' up there to do somethin' stupid, are you? \nJESSE (laughs; nervous) Stupid? Like what? \nCRAZY OL' COOT Like dig up Jason Voorhees -- that's what! \nEveryone in the car takes a sharp breath -- cold busted!  Then they start saying \"No! No!\" and shaking their heads innocently in a big performance that wouldn't fool a stick. \nJESSE (looks at Meagan) Jesus... why would anyone do that? \nCRAZY OL' COOT I dunno... but people do. \nSTORMIE Been dug up a few times already, has he? \nCRAZY OL' COOT More times than I care to remember. \nMEAGAN Well, we're just doing an article for our high school newspaper about the dangers of breaking into cemeteries at night. You know, stuff that can get you hurt... \nThe ol' coot scans the foursome again closely as he acquiesces. \nCRAZY OL' COOT Well... okay... as long as you're not going up there to do something stupid. (pointing) Take this road up about a mile and make a left at the ol' saw mill. That road will take you right on in... Eternal Peace Cemetery -- can't miss it. \nJesse is already standing on the gas, leaving the ol' coot standing in a cloud of smoke and dust. \nEXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT \nHeadlights skew across a rusty iron gateway -- ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY -- illuminating a sign: TRESPASSERS WILL BE SHOT! \nMeagan, Jesse, Stormie, and Erwin enter the shadowy cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their shoulders.  As they search through the cemetery, Meagan asks: \nMEAGAN What's the story on Jason Voorhees anyway? \nSTORMIE Where have you been? Jason was that guy who ran around in a hockey mask, chopping up camp counselors, duh? \nMEAGAN I knew that. What I mean was why? \nERWIN It started a long time ago, back in the fifties, when Jason drown at Camp Crystal Lake. His mother went berserk and started killing the counselors. \nSTORMIE She got her head chopped off by one of the girls she was trying to kill! \nERWIN Right. And then Jason came back from his watery grave to get revenge. \nJESSE He came back from the grave? \nERWIN Yeah. Chopped up a number of people before they finally caught up to him. \nMEAGAN What happened to him then? \nERWIN They killed him. \nJESSE How can you kill somebody who's back from the grave? \nERWIN Not very well apparently. Jason keeps coming back to life and chopping people up. It's a never ending cycle of terror up here at Crystal Lake -- a real problem. \nMEAGAN Why does he keep coming back to life and killing people? \nERWIN They say he's looking for revenge on the camp counselor who murdered him as a child. Jason just happens to go about it in the socially unacceptable way of hacking through every teenager he finds until he gets the right one. (spots grave) Here it is... \nErwin shines his light on Jason's grave. \nANGLE ON TOMBSTONE -- JASON VOORHEES. Born:1945. Died:1953. \nBeneath the death date, crudely scratched into the stone: 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, etc. \nJesse and Erwin start digging. \nELLIPSIS -- cemetery statues watching them dig. Stormie and Meagan take their turn.  Then... Jesse hits something solid. \nHands brush away the remaining dirt, exposing the coffin below.  Jesse takes a sharp breath and then jams a crowbar under the lid -- forcing it open. \nThe casket lid cracks open a bit when -- SSSSSS! -- noxious gas escapes.  Everyone covers their mouth and nose, suppressing the urge to hurl. \nThen roaches... hundreds of roaches. \nMeagan and Stormie run off, screaming, batting at their hair and clothing.  Jesse rolls around on the ground.  Erwin sighs, plucks a roach off his shirt, and calmly eats it. \nCUT TO: \nWHAM!  SPARKS fly.  Everyone screams.  Freddy laughs as he falls back for another shot.  Meagan sees the dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night- maremobile, staring out at her through the back window. A small yellow sign reads:  LOST SOULS ON BOARD. \nJesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly, the pieces of Jason ATTACK, BURSTING from behind the back seat.  One hand crawls up the back of the front seat, leaping onto Jesse's throat.  Jason's intestines EXPLODE out of the backseat, SLITHERING and SNAKING their way around Stormie and Erwin.  One of Jason's boots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards the gas peddle.  The other boot is content to lay under the back window and kick Erwin in the head. \nAs Meagan fights to pull Jason's hand of Jesse's face, she looks down and sees Jason's other hand between her legs.  Meagan screams. \nJason's boot stomps on the gas and Jesse's car lurches forward with the acceleration. The nightmaremobile SLAMS into the side of Jesse's car again, causing it to swerve violently from side to side. \nInside the nightmaremobile, Freddy pulls another lever. \nCLOSE ON THE NIGHTMAREMOBILE FENDER as a panel opens up and a circular sawblade arm extends out, CUTTING into Jesse's car with a flurry of SPARKS.  Inside, Meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg, CUTTING forward towards... \nCLOSE ON JESSE'S FRONT TIRE as the saw blade CUTS into it.  The tire BLOWS and Jesse's car lurches off the road, veering into a tree line. \nCRASH! -- Jesse's car plows fender-first into a tree, the HORN stuck on, BLARING. \nFreddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into overdrive, ROARING OFF and disappearing with an EXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant. \nIn the distance -- an old farmhouse.  The lights go on inside. \nThe passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the ground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound.  A rear door opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in embrace and not seriously hurt.  Meagan staggers around to the driver's side and opens the door.  Jesse is laying unconscious against the steering wheel. Meagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops. Jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess. \nMEAGAN (continuing) Jesse's hurt real bad... we've got to get him to a doctor. \nThrough the farmhouse window, Erwin and Stormie see the farmer on the phone. \nERWIN Don't worry... an ambulance is on the way. \nMeagan cradles Jesse's head in her hands, crying: \nMEAGAN Oh, God... Jesse... \nErwin goes to the trunk and opens it.  Inside -- the garbage bags with Jason's remains still inside -- untouched.  Erwin goes to Meagan and says: \nERWIN Meagan... listen to me... The cops are on their way. If they find me and Jason Voorhees in the trunk there, we're finished. \nMEAGAN Go... get out of here. Take Jason and Stormie with you. \nSTORMIE I'm staying with you. \nErwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says: \nERWIN I'll call you at the hospital. \nSTORMIE How? \nERWIN Somehow! \nErwin takes off, disappearing with Jason's remains into the night as SIRENS WAIL in the distance -- growing close. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nJesse is laying in a hospital bed, his leg in a special tent.  Meagan and Stormie watch from the doorway as a DOCTOR checks Jesse's vitals.  As he finishes, Meagan asks: \nMEAGAN Is he going to be okay? \nDOCTOR Yes. But he needs a lot of rest. His leg is broken in four places and he has four broken ribs and a concussion. \nMeagan sits down next to Jesse, taking his hand. Stormie turns to the doctor. \nSTORMIE Hey doc, is there someplace I could get us something to eat? \nDOCTOR I'm afraid the cafeteria is closed. There are some vending machines in the lobby. (to Meagan) I'll be back to check on him in a couple of hours. \nThe doctor exits. \nSTORMIE I'll be right back... I'm goin' go score us some munchies. \nMeagan nods weakly.  Stormie exits.  Meagan lays her head on Jesse's hand. \nINT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER \nStormie is getting several bags of munchies out of the vending machine when she turns and sees Murdoch at the information booth, flashing photos of Jesse and Erwin. \nStormie dashes for the staircase. \nThen a VOICE on the P.A. says: \nVOICE (filtered) Attention. Would Meagan or Stormie please pick up the white paging phone for a message? \nStormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks.  The announcement repeats itself again.  Then again. Stormie can't stand it anymore -- she stands up and picks up the white paging phone. \nSTORMIE (into phone) This is Stormie... \nMurdoch and his men come running past the nurse's station again.  Stormie turns her back to them but Murdoch goes back to the nurse's station, asking: \nMURDOCH Did you see a couple of girls go by here a moment ago? \nStormie gestures to the elevators. \nSTORMIE Just missed 'em. \nMurdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his men right behind.  Stormie exhales a giant sigh of relief as the HOSPITAL OPERATOR says: \nHOSPITAL OPERATOR (filtered) The message is from Erwin... he says to meet him at the side entrance in two minutes. \nStormie hangs up and grabs Meagan, running for the staircase. \nEXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER \nStormie drags Meagan out of the hospital just as Erwin pulls up in an old battered pick-up truck. He throws open the door and Stormie pushes Meagan inside, climbing in after her and asking: \nSTORMIE Where'd you get the truck? \nERWIN Same place I've got Jason hid. \nSTORMIE And where's that? \nERWIN A place where no one ever goes. \nStormie closes the door and the pick-up truck ROARS out of the parking lot. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT \nThe pick-up truck's headlights skew across a weather- worn sign, peppered with bullet holes: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE \nErwin drives the truck through the deserted camp, past the cabins, down towards the lake.  He stops a short distance away from the pier and the three of them climb out. \nMeagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her as Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving platform tied up to the end. \nSTORMIE What'd you do -- take him for a swim? \nERWIN Almost. \nErwin jumps down on the diving platform.  In the center, a large form is covered by a tarp.  Erwin helps Stormie down onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the pier.  She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant. Erwin moves close to Stormie and, gesturing to Meagan, asks: \nERWIN (continuing) Is she going to be alright? \nSTORMIE I don't know. She's pretty fucked up. God, I don't know why I'm not... \nERWIN You're a strong woman. \nSTORMIE What's that supposed to mean? \nERWIN Uhhh... nothing. I didn't mean anything. \nStormie gestures to the tarp. \nSTORMIE Is this him? \nERWIN Yeah... (whips back tarp) Meet the new and improved Jason. \nANGLE ON JASON laying spread eagle on the diving platform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of coiled leads trailing off into the water.  Erwin has done a good job of sewing Jason back together with barbed wire and fishing line.  His arms and legs have been reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's mask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with bailing wire.  Jason looks nineties... and butch. \nSTORMIE Why'd you put that stupid mask on him? \nERWIN Take a look... \nStormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask and quickly replaces it. \nSTORMIE Good idea. \nHEAD COUNSELOR Welcome aboard, son! I'm sure you'll have a great time! \nCUT TO: \nThe other KIDS dance around Jason, taunting him... laughing at him... pointing and teasing... Jason breaks away, running towards the pier. \nJason sits at the end of the pier, looking at his own reflection.  He removes the mask and watches as the distortions in the water make his face look normal. \nSomeone comes up behind Jason slowly.  Jason isn't aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection appears behind his own.  Jason turns to see who when he is suddenly pushed into the lake. \nJason splashes to the surface, sputtering, trying to stay afloat.  A hand pushes his head back under the water. \nJASON'S UNDERWATER P.O.V. -- a distorted image of whoever is holding him under. \nJason thrusts out his arms, fighting to get back to the surface... fighting just to see who is killing him before he dies. \nHARD CUT TO: \nEXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT \nJason comes alive, thrashing around on the diving dock, the electricity all over him like a spider web. On shore, Erwin and the girls gasp. \nERWIN Holy shit! It worked! \nMeagan and Stormie bounce, excitedly.  But something is wrong.  Jason thrashes around on the dock, unable to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire. \nMEAGAN It's kill him! Shut it off! Shut it off! \nERWIN Shut it off... it suddenly occurs to me that I hadn't really planned for that contingency. \nSTORMIE Just don't stand there! Do something! \nBut all Erwin can do is scratch his head.  Meagan rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake: \nMEAGAN Jason! JASON! You've got to get up! Do you hear me? Get up! \nJason clenches his meaty fists and SLAMS them down against the diving dock. SMASHING it to bits.  Water rushes over him and -- ZZZZT! KA-POW! \nA power transformer on shore EXPLODES, causing Meagan and her friends to cringe.  When they look back, the electrical light show fades away, leaving nothing but smoke and floating debris.  Meagan and Stormie turn to Erwin, who shrugs shyly and says: \nERWIN Well... it's off now. \nMeagan and Stormie begin a verbal barrage that would shrink any man to pus... much less Erwin.  He cowers between them, offering quick excuses and humble apologies. \nAll three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they never notice Jason's shadowy figure as it rises from the lake. \nThen they do see him... scream and run.  Jason charges after the kids in his familiar \"unstoppable killer\" gait. \nErwin ducks inside the tool shed as Meagan and Stormie dash past.  He closes the door behind him and squirms out a tiny window just as Jason kicks open the door and steps inside.  Erwin races around to the front and closes the door.  He fastens the latch and padlock, then calls to the girls: \nERWIN (continuing) Hey! Come back! I've got him locked up in the tool shed! \nJust then, the SOUND of a CHAINSAW as the blade RIPS through the tool shed door.  Erwin screams like a girl and runs away. \nINT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nMeagan and Stormie run into the main room.  Stormie spots a phone and goes to it, dialing frantically. \nMEAGAN Who are you calling?! \nSTORMIE The cops! Who else?! \nMEAGAN Are you kidding?! They'll lock us up and throw away the key! \nSTORMIE Fine by me! (clicks the receiver) Damnit! It's dead! \nJust then, Erwin bursts into the cabin, slamming the door shut behind him. \nERWIN He's right behind me! \nStormie and Meagan look out the window -- sure enough, Jason is storming towards them, holding the chainsaw. \nSTORMIE (to Erwin) You're the one who brought him back to life! \nERWIN And?! \nSTORMIE Well, do something! \nINT. FREDDY'S NOSTRIL CAVERN - NEXT SECOND \nNow the size of a flea, Stormie is clinging to one of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from the circular walls -- Freddy's nose hairs.  Stuck in those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk -- boogers. \nSitting next to Stormie, a particularly large and rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the distorted voice of Harry Manfredini): \nBOOGERMAN Hi there! I'm the Boogerman! Heh- heh... get it? \nStormie screams, backing up into the \"trees\", trying to put distance between herself and Boogerman. \nBOOGERMAN (continuing) Aww, don't go... we can play \"Star Wars\". You can be Princess Leia and I'll be Jabba the Hutt! \nBoogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba.  Stormie screams again. \nINT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME \nMeagan is getting more and more agitated. \nMEAGAN We're wasting time! We've got to close down all the churches -- Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy ground! \nMeagan's parents stare at their daughter with confused, frightened looks. \nMEAGAN (continuing) Don't you understand?! He has to come to our reality to do it! It's our last chance to kill him! \nMURDOCH Okay, I think we've heard enough of this crap. Take her back to the lockup. \nA couple of DEPUTIES grab Meagan.  She throws them off and they grab her again, roughly.  Meagan's parents watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their daughter back to her cell, kicking and screaming. \nMEAGAN Dad! Mom! Don't let them lock me up! I have to save Lizzy! \nMEAGAN'S MOM Oh, Meagan... you're sick. You don't even realize what you've done. \nMEAGAN I did what I had to do to try and save Lizzy! \nMURDOCH Yeah, including murdering your boy- friend and cutting his heart out. \nMEAGAN Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was already dead when I cut his heart out! \nMeagan's mom and dad gasp, recoiling with horror. \nMEAGAN (continuing; manic) Goddamnit, you don't understand! Freddy lives! FREDDY LIVES!!! \nMeagan's raving grows faint as she disappears into the cellblock.  Murdoch pulls Meagan's dad aside. \nMURDOCH I know how you must feel... I had a dog once. I loved that dog. I treated her like my own daughter. We went camping, picnics in the park... I even had a little stocking for her nailed up on the mantle for Christmas. Then one day, she bit me... so I had to blow her brains out. (sighs) God, I loved that dog. \nINT. STORMIE'S CELL & NOSTRIL CAVERN - SAME TIME \nFreddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger knife. \nA giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril cavern, sending Stormie into hysterics. \nBOOGERMAN Uh-oh, Freddy's picking his nose again -- gotta go! \nBoogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the nostril cavern.  Stormie watches the massive knife blade as it comes right for her, then at the last possible second she starts climbing after Boogerman. She pushes past the disgusting blob of goo, racing ahead. \nBOOGERMAN (continuing) Well, excuse me! \nINSERT -- Freddy pushes the knife way far back into his head. \nThe giant knife spears Boogerman in the back, running him through and spilling his \"Boogerman\" guts out his front.  Stormie gives a little squeal as Boogerman is pulled out, kicking and screaming. \nFreddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering closely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end. He twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger- man across the cell. \nBoogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack- ing into the far wall with a giant SPLAT! Boogerman flattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo, his nasty head still alive in the center. \nFreddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to the deputy's desk.  He feels around on the table until he touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into Stormie's cell. \nFreddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his right palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks of pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she clings to life deep inside the nostril. \nFreddy's face begins to distort, his nose wrinkling up -- the beginnings of a sneeze. \nFREDDY Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh--CHOO! \nMicro-Stormie comes blasting out of Freddy's nose with globules of snot.  She flies across the massive cell, headed directly for the splattered Boogerman, screaming her head off. \nBoogerman sees Stormie racing towards him and he screams too. \nRELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER (filtered) This is Channel 12 -- Station W.G.O.D. -- where the \"W\" stands for \"Worship\" And now... \"Daily Affirmation\" with Reverend Lawrence Lovejoy... \nA shot of the REVEREND LOVEJOY at the podium in his studio, giving kind words of encouragement. \nREVEREND LOVEJOY Good morning, friends... the Good Book says that each morning brings a new light into our lives... \nThe good reverend goes on about it always being darkest before the dawn, have faith and your prayers will be answered, etc.  Meagan turns and watches the sunrise -- glorious.  Tears stream down her cheeks.  Then a commercial comes on: \nRELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER (filtered) You can own a videotape of Reverend Lovejoy's Daily Affirmation for only \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - MORNING \nIn his booth at the main gate, the GATE GUARD watches as a procession of hearses approaches.  As the first hearse reaches the gate, the guard steps out and says: \nGATE GUARD Hello. What can I do for you? \nA cultist sticks his head out the window and says: \nCULTIST We're here to see the Reverend Lovejoy. We need him to perform a wedding. \nGATE GUARD Do you have an appointment? \nCULTIST No. I have a Beretta. \nThe cultist produces a pistol -- BANG! \nINT. STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER \nThe REVEREND LOVEJOY is at his podium, his WIFE at the organ, waiting for the commercial break to be over. The FLOOR MANAGER counts down -- three... two... one... \nBAM! -- the cultists burst into the studio.  The CAMERA OPERATOR and FLOOR MANAGER are killed.  The Reverend Lovejoy and his WIFE, at the organ, are taken hostage. \nINT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME \nANGLE ON TV as the cultists take the reverend and his wife hostage.  Meagan watches, suddenly perplexed. \nINT. STUDIO - NEXT SECOND \nThe cultists break into the control room, killing the DIRECTOR and STAFF.  One slips into the sound booth, garroting the RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER with a piece of wire. Another SMASHES the control board, killing the signal. All the feed monitors go snowy. \nINT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME \nANGLE ON TV as the picture goes to static.  Just then, the deputy appears in front of Meagan's cell. \nMEAGAN Something just happened at the TV station. \nDEPUTY Don't worry about it -- get undressed. \nMEAGAN What for? \nDEPUTY Time to get you cleaned up for court. \nMeagan looks back at the TV as she slowly starts to get undressed. \nINT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER \nThe deputy ushers Meagan into the showers.  Inside, a naked group of mean, nasty, ugly JAIL HOUSE BITCHES are showering, washing hairy pits, flabby tattooed skin, and greasy hair.  They eye Meagan like the dessert bar at Denny's as she crosses to the opposite side, sneaking into a corner.  Meagan turns on the shower and drops the towel -- the bitches whistle and catcall. \nJust then, the deputy gets called away, leaving Meagan to the mercy of the bitches.  The head bitch slides over to Meagan and says: \nHEAD BITCH What's the matter, honey... you don't like our company? \nMEAGAN I like you... sure. It's just that I usually shower alone, that's all. \nHEAD BITCH Oh! So you're shy? I like 'em when they're shy... \nThe head bitch grabs at Meagan, who resists.  But this bitch is big and tough and holds Meagan by the wrists as she tries to kiss her.  The other bitches laugh. \nHEAD BITCH (continuing) Don't fight it, baby! You know you want me... \nMeagan scratches the head bitch's face.  She backs off screaming, wiping blood from her face.  Then she spits, reaches down (below the frame line) and produces a shiv. \nHEAD BITCH (continuing) If you won't give me a piece then I'll just cut one for myself... \nThe head bitch moves in.  Meagan takes a cautious step back, bumping into tile -- nowhere to go.  She holds up her hands. \nREVEREND LOVEJOY And who would be the bride? \nLizzy is brought forth.  The cultists take her arm and inject her with the dream dope.  Lizzy's head lulls around as she chants softly: \nLIZZY One... two... Freddy's coming for you. \nThe rest of the cultists shoot up -- passing the needle from one to another. \nLIZZY (continuing) Three... four... Better lock your door. \nThe good reverend watches this with a lump in his throat.  He shudders and asks: \nREVEREND LOVEJOY And the groom. \nCULTIST He's coming... \nLizzy is almost asleep. \nLIZZY Five... six... grab your crucifix... \nThe neon cross behind the podium begins to flicker. Then with a sharp SNAP of electricity, the cross falls over, turning upside down.  It hangs there for an instant then -- POW! -- the cross EXPLODES, catching the curtains on FIRE. \nAs the FLAMES consume the curtains, a hole in reality appears -- a Dreamgate.  Freddy comes springing out, leaping in front of the podium.  He laughs and turns to Lizzy, asleep on the bench. \nFREDDY That's for the lift sister! (to the cultists) Hiya, kids! \nCULTISTS (in unison) Hiya, Freddy! \nFREDDY Ready to get hitched? \nCULTISTS Ready, Freddy! \nFREDDY Then let's do it! \nLizzy looks up and smiles. \nLIZZY I love you, Freddy... \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON \nA DEPUTY comes up to Murdoch and says: \nDEPUTY We found your patrol car, Captain. It was abandoned near a local religious station. \nMURDOCH Religious station? Is there a padre there? \nDEPUTY Yes, sir. Reverend Lovejoy broad- casts out of that location. \nMURDOCH So that's where they're hiding. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STUDIO - SAME TIME \nLizzy and Freddy stand before Reverend Lovejoy. \nREVEREND LOVEJOY ...and if there be anyone among you who has any reason why these two should not be joined in holy... \nFreddy holds up a finger -- \"Ah-ah\". \nREVEREND LOVEJOY (continuing) ...in matrimony. Let them speak now... (under his breath) ...please God... (aloud) ...or forever hold their peace. \nWHAM! -- Meagan bursts in. \nMEAGAN Stop! \nEveryone turns and looks as Meagan comes to the pulpit. \nMEAGAN (continuing; to Freddy) Take me, Freddy. Take me instead. \nFREDDY You're a virgin?! \nMEAGAN Oh, that's right -- tell everybody! \nFreddy moves close to Meagan, running a blade over and around Meagan's neck as she struggles to remain calm. \nERWIN I can't wake them up. Freddy's got them trapped! \nErwin thinks for a moment, then rushes over to a couple of dead cultists.  He takes their syringes. Erwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full of dream dope. \nERWIN (continuing) Go get him, boy! \nJason staggers forward, falling into... \nINT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nJason falls into a boxing arena.  The ropes are entrails and atop each corner post is mounted a human head.  The spectators are all DEMONS, MONSTERS, and the LIVING DEAD. \nJason looks over at his opponent -- dressed in boxing shorts, shoes, and gloves -- it's Freddy. \nJason raises his arms and finds he too is wearing boxing gloves. \nTED BUNDY steps into the ring. \nTED BUNDY (into microphone) Ladies and gentlemen... welcome to the fight of the century! I'm your ring announcer... Ted Bundy! \nBANG! -- a bullet hole appears in Ted's forehead, BLOWING his brains out the back.  He falls over DEAD and the crowd cheers.  Ted sits up and pulls the wig back over his shaved head and electric burns as he calls into the balcony: \nTED BUNDY (continuing) Verrrrrry funny, Oswald! \nANGLE IN BALCONY -- OSWALD stands, his rifle still smoking. \nOSWALD (angry; defensive) It wasn't me! \nTed Bundy gets to his feet and finishes the intro: \nTED BUNDY In my left corner, weighing in at only ninety seven pounds... the nightmare master himself! The one! The only... Freddddddddy Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr!!! \nFreddy holds up his arms and the crowd goes wild. \nTED BUNDY (continuing) And on my right... weighing in at a whopping four hundred and thir- teen pounds... that killer of countless teenagers... the big guy... (gestures to Jason) Jason Voorhees! \nCHEERS and BOOS. \nTED BUNDY (continuing) And the prize tonight... not one but TWO -- count 'em -- TWO virgins... ripe for the picking. \nTed gestures to a large cage suspended over the arena. Inside -- Meagan and Lizzy clutch eachother. \nTED BUNDY (continuing) Hey, have one now and save the other for the ride home. That's what I did. \nLAUGHTER from the crowd. \nMEAGAN Kick his ass, Jason! \nDING! -- the bell sounds.  The first round begins... \nFreddy starts towards Jason, cocking his glove for a blow when -- CH-CHING! -- knife blades jut out of the glove.  He punches Jason in the stomach and starts RIPPING him open, rotten guts spilling out. \nJason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an axe in her head.  This is BLOODY MARY.  Jason reaches over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of her head.  Bloody Mary whips around, yelling: \nBLOODY MARY HEY! \nJason swings with the axe -- SH-WACK! -- Jason SLICES OFF Freddy's arm.  The crowd ROARS.  Freddy looks down at the open armpit, GUSHING with ROTTEN BLOOD, and shrugs: \nFREDDY Oh, well... I just axed for that! \nFreddy GROWS a new arm, complete with glove of knives. Jason throws the axe at Freddy, who ducks it.  The axe flies into the audience, SMACKING MUSSOLINI square between the eyes.  He falls back to the floor.  HITLER turns to EVA BRAUN and says disdainfully: \nHITLER Peasants... \nDING!  The bell sounds.  Freddy and Jason break, going into their respective corners.  As Jason sits down in his corner, the HUMAN HEAD mounted on his corner post starts in: \nHUMAN HEAD That's it, kiddo! You're really giving it to him out there! Use the left more -- jab! Make him hurt! That's the ticket to a knockout! \nUp in her cage, Meagan clutches a terrifed Lizzy. \nINT. STUDIO - SAME TIME \nErwin watches Jason sleep as the cultists BANG down the studio door. \nINT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT MOMENT \nDING!  The bell sounds again and round two begins. Freddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on each other.  Jason swings wide.  Freddy ducks under Jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for a close look.  WHUMP -- Jason knocks the ref's head OFF, it goes flying up into the balcony.  The crowd CHEERS. \nIn the control room, Freddy's face appears on every monitor, laughing. \nERWIN Oh, no! Freddy's in the transmitter! \nErwin watches as an electrical Freddy-impulse races from the control room via a long thick cable running overhead. \nERWIN (continuing) He's going for the satellite dish! If he uplinks with a communications satellite he can beam himself any- where in the world! We'll never be rid of him! \nMeagan and Jason look up at the Freddy-impulse shoots past them, going through the ceiling to the... \nEXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nThe satellite dish mounted on the roof.  It begins to pulsate with an olive and red glow -- getting ready to beam Freddy. \nINT. STUDIO - SAME TIME \nMeagan reaches up and grabs the cable, pulling it hard. \nEXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nThe roof gives way, tilting the big dish just as it BLASTS the laughing Freddy-beam into the night sky. \nEXT. EARTH'S UPPER ATMOSPHERE - NEXT INSTANT \nThe Freddy-beam just misses the satellite, ricocheting off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite tumbling into deep space. \nThe deflected Freddy-beam now zooms towards the sun. \nInside the beam -- Freddy sees the sun zooming up and screams.  His face burns away, leaving a screaming skull.  That too burns away, leaving the Dream Demons. One by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun. \nANGLE ON THE SUN as the beam EXPLODES, causing a solar prominence. \nINT. TV STATION - STUDIO - SAME TIME \nThe ceiling collapses in on Jason, burying him under a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish.  A ton of dust billows up. \nJust then, Murdoch bursts in.  He sees Lizzy and Meagan and takes aim with the shotgun.  Erwin sees this and jumps in-between them, yelling: \nERWIN No! Wait! \nMurdoch FIRES.  The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across the room, where he lands in a heap.  Meagan and Lizzy run to his side. \nErwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his chest.  With fading strength, Erwin pulls his pin out and pricks himself.  Erwin smiles and dies. \nMEAGAN Erwin? Erwin?! \nMURDOCH He's dead... and so are you if you don't put your hands up right now! \nLizzy turns and attacks Murdoch.  He knocks her to the floor, taking aim on her head with the shotgun as he says: \nMURDOCH (continuing) It's time I taught you girls some respect for the law! \nIn a panic, Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen cultist and FIRES it at Murdoch's head. \nPTT-TWANG! -- Murdoch's hat goes flying off with a SPARK HIT, revealing his bald, hideous head -- a large open wound with a metal plate underneath.  He turns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face. \nMURDOCH (continuing) So... you wanna be a punk? \nMurdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on Meagan. \nMURDOCH (continuing) Then die like a punk! \nMurdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him.  Jason jams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and pulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor with a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble.  We see Murdoch's name written into his shorts. \nAs Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his hand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat of his pants.  Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth.  Jason cocks the shotgun and... \nBOOM! -- Murdoch's head and shoulders EXPLODE from his torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out of shirt.  Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his metal plate comes PINGING down, rolling around and spinning to a stop like a hubcap. \nJason drops Murdoch (what's left of him) to the floor just as the S.W.A.T. commander and his men come charging in.  They see Jason and raise their guns in panic. \nMEAGAN NO! \nToo late.  The cops let loose with a BARRAGE of GUN- FIRE.  BULLET HITS EXPLODE on Jason's chest.  Meagan grabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets WHIZZ past. \nMore cops hear the SHOOTING and come running.  They start SHOOTING too.  Soon the doorway to the studio is crowded with muzzle flash. \nMore and more BULLET HITS SMACK Jason.  A bullet hole outline appears on the wall behind him. \n", "test1_input": "STORMIE How will they ever know? Don't be such a pussy! \nJESSE Oh, yeah? Why don't you call then? \nSTORMIE Okay, I will! \nMEAGAN No! They'll never believe her! \nSTORMIE I can disguise my voice... (lowers voice) Hello, how do you do? My name is Jesse. I think I'm a man but I'm actually a wimp. \nMEAGAN They'll never believe that. Come on, Jesse... for me? \nJESSE Okay... okay... I'll do it. (to Stormie) And I'm not a wimp! \nJesse sighs and steps into the phone booth.  After a moment's hesitation, Jesse steps out and immediately both girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make the call.  Jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both girls shut up, he says: \nJESSE (continuing) I need a quarter for the phone. \nMeagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him.  Jesse re-enters the booth. \nANGLE IN PHONE BOOTH as Jesse dials a number. \nINT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - NEXT INSTANT \nThe security guard picks up his phone as it RINGS. \nSECURITY GUARD Springwood Mental Center... how can I help you? \nJESSE (filtered; disguising his voice) There's a bomb planted in your building. \nSECURITY GUARD Who is this? \nJESSE If I were you -- I'd get my ass out of there. \nIn the background, we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper something to Jesse. \nJESSE (continuing; adding) Oh, yeah... Freddy Lives. \nCLICK! -- The guard's eyes grow wide. \nEXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON -SECONDS LATER \nThe peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a fire ALARM.  Soon all the INMATES start filing out into the yard, loosely herded by the GUARDS.  Erwin files out with the others, still wearing his straight jacket. \nErwin looks over at the parking lot -- Jesse's car flashes it's lights.  Erwin starts to casually wander off towards the fence between himself and freedom when the SECURITY GUARD spots him and says: \nSECURITY GUARD Hey, Erwin... where do you think you're going? \nErwin ignores him, still moving towards the fence. \nSECURITY GUARD (continuing) I'm talking to you, asshole! \nErwin breaks into a run.  The guard takes off after him. \nIn the car, Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie watch as the guard closes the distance. \nJESSE He's not going to make it. \nMEAGAN We've got to do something! \nWith grim determination, Jesse starts his car. \nJesse's car tears out of the parking lot, racing for the fence.  With a loud, metallic CHING, Jesse's car drives into the fence, knocking that section down. Erwin dances over the downed chain-link, diving into an open window.  Then, with a SQUEAL of tires and the RENDING of metal, Jesse's car backs out of the fence, does a 180, and PEELS off. \nANGLE INSIDE CAR as Stormie and Meagan help Erwin out of his straight jacket.  Once freed, Erwin extends his hand to Jesse. \nERWIN Hi, my name's Erwin. Thanks for busting me out of there! \nJesse looks at Erwin's outstretched hand -- the fingertips are all heavily bandaged. \nJESSE Yeah, right... Look, Erwin, just do me one favor -- don't eat nothing disgusting. My stomach is tight enough as it is. \nThe security guard runs up to the fence, huffing and puffing, watching as Jesse's car disappears down the street.  Then he spots something in the fence and plucks it out... \nJesse's front license plate. \nCUT TO: \n", "test1_true": "CLOSE ON LIZZY, screaming and crying as the cultists close in around her.  They rip her sleeve off and inject her with a syringe.  After a moment, Lizzy starts to settle down... falling asleep... \nThe cultists lift Lizzy up over their heads and carry her towards the big boiler.  Inside -- a raging INFERNO. \nLIZZY'S DREAM STATE P.O.V. -- as the cultists reach the boiler, it splits open in the middle like a giant gate.  The two halves swing open wide to reveal... \nINT. HELL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nA narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop a tall, narrow mountain.  On either side of the ledge is a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below -- rivers of hot molten lava stretching out for miles, filled with LOST SOULS DROWNING and BURNING.  Hundreds upon hundreds of voices are SCREAMING and MOANING -- a terrible chorus of the damned. \nThe cultists carry Lizzy across the rocky ledge to the mausoleum.  The outside of this ancient structure is engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of mankind.  In the center -- a large iron gate that swings open as the cultists near. \nThe cultists roll Lizzy over in their arms, holding her tight as they push her face forward into the mirror.  The glass gives way like mercury, Lizzy's face disappearing into the mirror. \nANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE (UNDERWATER) -- Lizzy's face stares out into utter blackness.  Then, some- thing large and evil looking swims up out of the darkness.  Clawed hands reach out and grab Lizzy by the sides of the face as the huge, monstrous head moves forward -- evil lips parting -- tongue slithering out. \nThe evil thing gives Lizzy a big, wet French kiss, locking it's lips over hers.  Several slippery some- things slither into her mouth.  Lizzy struggles, but the big evil thing is way too strong.  Finally, it releases her and the cultists pull her back out. \nThe cultists carry Lizzy out of Hell and back into the... \nINT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nHorribly burned hands slap Lizzy back from her semi- conscious state.  Her eyes grow wide with fear again as she opens her mouth to scream.  Suddenly, she doubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a cultist thrusts under her. \nThree evil-looking eels slither forth from Lizzy's mouth -- the Dream Demons. \nEXT. OLD POWER PLANT - DUSK \nSeveral shadows flee into the night as Jesse's car pulls up next to a run-down building. \nINT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nErwin leads Meagan, Jesse and Stormie down into the old, burnt out boiler room.  They work their way towards the back, to a large table and a collection of sofas and easy chair scattered about.  Erwin starts sniffing around, pointing out several used syringes laying scattered about the floor. \nERWIN Damn! We must have just missed them! \nMeagan spots Lizzy's shirt sleeve on the floor. \nMEAGAN Oh, my God -- she was here! This is part of Lizzy's shirt! It's all torn! (grabs Erwin) Erwin... we've got to find her! \nERWIN We're too late! There's no way... except... \nMEAGAN Except what?! \nERWIN We could go after Freddy. \nMEAGAN How? \nErwin goes to a boiler, bends down and reaches way up underneath.  After fishing around for a moment, he draws out a well-worn Mutant Ninja Turtles lunch box.  Inside -- a vile of liquid, several syringes, and several pairs of cult shades. \nERWIN We'll inject ourselves with Dream Dope.  It's a mild narcotic that brings on a dreamlike state. \nMeagan thinks about this for a moment, then nods her approval. \nMEAGAN Okay... let's do it! \nJESSE Meagan... we don't do drugs! I mean, what if one of us gets hooked or something? (whispers) We could turn out like him! \nJesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin. \nERWIN Don't worry about it. We need you wide awake anyway. \nJESSE What for? \nERWIN We're going to go under and try to find Freddy. When we do, we'll grab him and bring him here. Then you kill him with this... \nErwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver. \nJESSE This rusty chunk of shit? What good is this? \nERWIN It's not the gun, it's what's in it -- silver bullets blessed by a priest. \nJESSE Will that work? \nERWIN (shrugs) Should. But then... \nJESSE (finishes for him) You don't make the rules... yeah, yeah. \n", "test1_id": 2532, "test2_input": "STORMIE He's head right for her! Do some- thing! \nErwin panics for a moment, then HONKS the HORN. \nINT. MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT \nMeagan is trying to pull Jesse's heart out of his chest but it just won't come, some vein or muscle fiber keeps pulling it back.  She jumps at the HORN, then starts pulling harder. \nIn the hallway just outside, the guard hears the HORN and stops.  He starts back for the front, when suddenly the HORN stops. \nMeagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling to Jesse's heart.  As the last strand goes, Meagan tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD. \nThe guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue, drawing his gun.  He tip-toes to the door and carefully unlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock.  Taking a two-handed Weaver stance, the guard raises his foot and kicks the door. \nWHACK! -- the door flies open and the guard leaps inside like Marshall Dillon, snapping on the lights. He gasps, eyes going wide as he scans the room.  One of the drawers is open... the stiff's chest has got a huge hole in it... blood spattered everywhere... a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the cabinet... \nSuddenly, the guard sees Meagan half out the window and cries: \nGUARD Stop right there! \nMeagan rolls out of the window just as the guard FIRES. The unbroken section of the window SHATTERS.  The guard curses and races for the... \nEXT. MORGUE - SECONDS LATER \nThe guard comes running out just in time to see Meagan close the passenger door and the truck ROAR away.  He shrinks, dejected -- no way to catch them now.  The guard heads back inside to report this mess and finds that the door has closed and locked behind him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT \nThe crazy ol' coot is leading Murdoch through the cemetery. \nCRAZY OL' COOT They said they were writin' for some newspaper... \nMURDOCH Teenagers are notorious liars. \nCRAZY OL' COOT Well, after I heard about the accident on my police scanner, I came up here to have a look. When I found it I figured you'd want to know right away. \nMURDOCH You did the right thing. \nThe ol' coot shines his light down into Jason's empty grave. \nCRAZY OL' COOT Damn kids... I just knew they were comin' up here to do somethin' stupid. \nThe S.W.A.T. commander comes up to Murdoch. \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER Just got a call on the radio -- three juveniles just broke into the morgue -- one male, two female. The guard is pretty sure the male is in the Freddy cult -- burnt face. \nCRAZY OL' COOT Sounds like the same kids I saw. \nMURDOCH Did the guard say what they took? \nS.W.A.T. COMMANDER Yeah... that murdered kid, Jesse -- they carved his heart out. (beat) They got away in a pick-up -- the guard didn't get the license. You want me to put out an A.P.B.? \nMURDOCH No... that won't be necessary. I know just where they're going, and just what they're up to. And this time... I'll be ready. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT \nMeagan sits on the end of the pier, watching silently as Erwin sews Jesse's heart into Jason's chest using dental floss.  Stormie comes up behind her and puts her jacket around Meagan's shoulders, sits down beside her and says: \nSTORMIE You've got to quit blaming your- self for what happened to Jesse... it wasn't your fault. \nMEAGAN He didn't want to come with us... but he did anyway. He did it for me. \nSTORMIE I'm not sorry I came... I don't think Jesse would be, either. \nMEAGAN I just can't believe he's dead. I keep thinking he'll show up any minute... \nERWIN Well, that just about does it... \nErwin finishes sewing up Jason and climbs back onto the pier, cutting the diving platform free.  He kicks it off and it floats out into the lake, drifting free. Then Erwin herds the girls down the shore, leading them over to where a short trench has been dug leading from the water's edge. \nIn the bottom of the trench -- an uncovered power cable. \nERWIN (continuing) As you can see, I've excavated the power cable that runs across the bottom of Crystal Lake. I've cut away the insulation, exposing a patch of cable right near the water's edge. \n", "test2_true": "ERWIN (continuing) Now when I kick this over, the water will wash down the trench and bridge an eletrical gap between the cable and the lake. There's plenty of voltage, so it should work. \nSTORMIE So you kick the bucket and Jason lives. \nERWIN Yeah, right... (then) Okay, keep your fingers crossed... \nErwin kicks the bucket over.  The water washes down the trench, over the cable, and -- POW! Z-Z-Z-ZAP! A huge SPARK HITS EXPLODES.  Then the lake begins to glow and the water begins to churn.  Erwin and the girls jump back as ELECTRICITY ARCS from the lake, engulfing the diving platform. \nThe ARCS of ELECTRICITY leap from the chicken wire onto Jason's body, his massive frame convulsing. \nCLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK as we PUSH IN -- the electricity spirals down into the eye hole like water running down a drain. \nCLOSE ON JASON'S EYE as it opens!  We dive into the eye and take a fantastic dream/time travel to... \nOPTICAL TRANSITION TO: \nEXT. VOORHEES CABIN - 1953 - DAY \nCLOSE ON MASK (1950's version of a hockey mask) reflected in the water.  A young hand reaches up and pulls off the mask, revealing the disfigured boy beneath.  This is JASON -- AGE 9. \nJASON'S FATHER comes to the doorway of their run- down cabin in dirty longjohns, holding a bottle of rye. He bellows: \nJASON'S FATHER Jason! Git your ass over here! \nJason jumps at his father's voice, hesitates only slightly, then runs toward him, stopping abruptly several paces away. \nJASON'S FATHER (continuing) What did I teach you, boy? Don't ever take your mask off out in public. I don't want nobody to see that ugly mug of yours. \nJason stands, looking at his bare feet. His father smacks him upside the head, shoving him towards the woodshed. \nJASON'S FATHER (continuing) Go git in the woodshed. \nJason's pace slows as he enters the dark shed -- he knows what's coming next. \nJASON'S FATHER (continuing) Drop them overalls and lay over them logs... \nJason slowly complies as his father loosens his belt. Suddenly, JASON'S MOTHER is just outside the doorway, calling: \nJASON'S MOTHER Jason! Come here! \nJason gives his father a sideways glance, then scurries towards his mother. \nJASON'S FATHER What are you doing woman? \nJason's mother gives him a mason jar stuffed with dollars and change. \nJASON'S MOTHER I saved up some money... I want you to take and go on up to that summer camp just up the road. Tell the man you want to stay there. \nJASON'S FATHER Just what the hell do you think you're doing, bitch?! \nJASON'S MOTHER I'm sending him away for a few weeks. \nJASON'S FATHER You ain't sending him nowhere. (to Jason) Bring me that money, boy! \nJason holds his ground for a second, unsure whom to obey, when his mother shoos him away. \nJASON'S MOTHER Go on now... go! \nJason takes off up the road.  His father sneers: \nJASON'S FATHER Goin' ag'in me? I'll take you to the shed, woman! \nJason's mother pulls a knife from her apron. \nJASON'S MOTHER You ain't ever taking anyone to the shed ever again. \nJason's mother charges at her husband, shoving him back into the shed with the knife.  Jason looks back. Through the open window he sees his mother's arm coming down repeatedly with the knife, his father's arms flailing helplessly.  Then both disappear from view.  After a moment his mother appears in the door- way, spattered with blood.  She smiles and waves to him, calling: \nJASON'S MOTHER (continuing) Go on, son... have a good time! Mommy will come and git you some day soon! \nJason turns and runs to... \nEXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY \nWearing his mask, Jason walks through the entrance to the camp with his jar of money. \nIn the office, the HEAD COUNSELOR takes his money and shakes his hand. \n", "test2_id": 2533, "test3_input": "MURDOCH (continuing; into radio) Let her go. \nEXT. 60,000 FEET ABOVE CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND \nA military jet flying above drops it's payload -- a laser-guided napalm bomb. \nEXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME TIME \nA slight WHISTLE sound grows in the skies above Camp Crystal Lake.  Jason looks up. \nSMART BOMB P.O.V. as it drops down on Jason -- homing in on the laser dot on his chest. \nBA-BOOM! -- Camp Crystal Lake EXPLODES in flames. All the cops take cover as FIRE RAINS DOWN on them. Only Murdoch stands his ground, his arms outstretched as he embraces the terrible sight. \nMURDOCH That'll teach you to fuck with the law, Voorhees! \nA cop behind him says: \nCOP Uhh, sir... your hat's on fire. \nMurdoch looks up -- sure enough, his Smokey Bear hat is burning above the brim. \nMeagan watches as Camp Crystal Lake is consume in flames, her last hope of saving Lizzy -- gone.  Then a cop shoves her into a police car with Stormie. Erwin is put into another car and the three exchange worrisome looks through the windows just before the cars pull away. \nAs the cops start to pull out, one of them notices something moving amidst the flames -- a large BURNING form, walking towards the lake.  As it stumbles out onto the pier, the cop turns to his partner and says: \nCURIOUS COP Hey... do you see that? \nBut just then, the form falls through the BURNING pier, SPLASHING into the water below.  The partner looks, sees nothing, and shrugs. \nPARTNER See what? \nCURIOUS COP I thought I saw something... \nHe shrugs it off and exits after his partner. \nMurdoch, his hat still smoking a little, surveys the sight one last time before climbing into his patrol car and driving away. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NIGHT \nA cell door SLAMS in front of Stormie's face. A cell door SLAMS in front of Meagan's face.  Both girls are behind bars, separated by a cement wall.  The hefty female DEPUTY in charge of the cellblock goes back to her desk. \nBoth girls stand in their cells next to eachother, watching as the deputy goes back to her desk and begins to devour three combo-burritos. \nMEAGAN We've got to try and stay awake. \nSTORMIE Getting something to eat might help. (calls to Deputy) Yo, Butch! \nDEPUTY MILLER It's Deputy Miller. \nSTORMIE Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could we have something to eat? \nDEPUTY MILLER I thought you psychos only ate human hearts? \nSTORMIE And I thought you pigs only ate donuts. \nDEPUTY MILLER Don't make me come back there. \nSTORMIE (low; to Meagan) Cow! I hope she chokes on her three combo-burrito cud! \nMeagan leans up against the wall, sliding down to the floor in defeat. \nMEAGAN What am I going to do? I'll never be able to find Lizzy now. \nSTORMIE You should be worrying about your- self... I know I am. \nStormie plops down on her cot. \nMEAGAN I bet you're sorry you came with me now... \nSTORMIE Nah... what are best friends for? Afterall, you stuck by me through all my crazy phases, I figure I owe you one big crazy phase, right? \nMEAGAN That's for being my best friend, Stormie. \nJust then, Deputy Miller steps in front of Meagan's cell, unlocking it. \n", "test3_true": "MEAGAN Where are we going? \nDEPUTY MILLER Your parents are here. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

So have I. \nMeagan stands handcuffed, her hair mussed, her clothes bloody and soiled. \nMEAGAN Sorry. Today has been a bitch. \nINT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME \nThe deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos that she doesn't notice the strange shadow that passes behind her. \nThe shadow moves down the cellblock, accompanied by a slight SCRAPING.  Freddy's glove materializes, raking the knives along the metal cross bars.  Freddy stops at Stormie's cell, looking inside. \nStormie is fast asleep. \nFreddy walks into Stormie's cell, passing right through the bars.  Suddenly, Stormie wakes and, seeing Freddy, jumps to her feet and screams. \nSTORMIE Help! Help! Freddy's here! He's here! \nBut the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesn't respond, finishing off the rest of the burrito and licking her meaty fingers clean.  Freddy puts his forefinger knife to his lips and shushes Stormie, pointing to her cot.  Stormie looks over and sees her- self asleep. \nSTORMIE (continuing) Oh, shit! I'm still asleep! \nShe looks up at Freddy, who smiles and says: \nFREDDY You know what they say... when you sleep -- you die! \nFreddy flashes the glove of knives. \nINT. POLICE STATION - NEXT MOMENT \nMEAGAN'S MOM Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said you helped one of those cultists escape from a hospital? \nMEAGAN A mental hospital. \nMEAGAN'S MOM And he said you desecrated a cemetery and some other really terrible things. Tell me you had nothing to do with it. Tell me there's some mistake...? \nMEAGAN There's no mistake.

CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME \nFreddy taunts Stormie as the circle around in the cell by slicing off his fingers, squirting green slime. Stormie winces a little but keeps her distance and cool. \nSTORMIE You don't scare me, Freddy! Thanks to my various phases and many hours of watching violent televison, I have become immune to violence. Seen it all and done it all! Nothing you do can gross me out -- so why don't you give it your best shot, bitch! \nFREDDY Then maybe I'll just CUT to the chase! \nFreddy swings the glove but Stormie ducks, keeping her defensive stance. \nSTORMIE I'm warning you, Freddy... my father is a drill sergeant in the Marine Corps and he taught me just how to defend myself against slimy bastards like you. \nFREDDY Oh I'm so scared, honey. Come on! Hit me! Punch me right in the nose! I dare you! \nFreddy juts out his chin, gesturing for Stormie to take a punch.  Stormie throws a right and pops Freddy right in the nose. \nFREDDY (continuing; surprised) Owwwww! \nStormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her fist is stuck in Freddy's nose.  Freddy takes in a breath and Stormie's arm is sucked up past the elbow. She screams. \nFreddy takes a deep breath and snorts Stormie right up his nose, her screams turning into a faint BUZZ. Freddy smiles. \nFREDDY (continuing) Now that's what I call getting a buzz. \n", "test3_id": 2534}

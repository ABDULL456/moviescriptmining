CLYDE (Beat) How well do you know your bible, Michael? 
MIKE Jesus Fucking Christ... 
Clyde SLAPS Mike across the face. 
CLYDE I told you before to watch that mouth, mister. 
MIKE Fuck you. 
Clyde PUNCHES him, not once, but twice.    He readies a third. 
CLYDE You through? 
Mike spits some blood on the floor.    Nods. 
CLYDE I'll ask again... how well do you know the bible? 
MIKE Not very. 
CLYDE That's okay. It's fine. That's why I am here... teach you the way things are and the way they should be. 
73   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                                   73 
Sheryl sits in a chair in the middle of the room. Still gagged. She wears a new outfit. A handmade dress with a small crest embroidered over the heart. IT'S SIMILAR TO THE ONE WORN BY SARAH (GIRL FROM THE OPENING SCENE OF FILM). 
Ida pulls tight the rope securing her wrists to the arms of the chair. Satisfied. 
IDA I'll be right back. 
Ida exits the room. Deacon stands by the door.        He and Sheryl alone together. 
Sheryl tries not to make eye contact. 
Deacon stares at her.     Longingly. 
DEACON'S POV - On Sheryl's chest, expanding and contracting with every breath. 
ON DEACON - SLOWLY PUSH INTO TIGHT CLOSE UP 
DEACON'S POV - Sheryl, a heavenly glow encircles her (and her gag mysteriously gone), turns to Deacon. A look of calm and lust in her eyes. 
SHERYL I want you, Deacon. (Jump Cut to...) I want you to fuck me.   Hard. 
ON DEACON - His stare deepens. 
Sheryl, the heavenly glow gone, her gag back in place. Watches Deacon. She squirms, cries. 
74   INT.   CHAPEL - NIGHT                                      74 
Clyde sits in a chair next to Mike. 
CLYDE Lord knows the will of a man gets tested. Cruelly most times. But the righteous persevere. They do what needs to be done, even though they don't want to. It's what makes a man, a man. Let me tell you the story of Judas, he was one of Jesus's apostles. Judas led Roman Soldiers to the capture and eventual death of our Lord Jesus Christ. And now, is supposedly seated next to Satan, his soul burning in hell forever for this sin. But I don't believe that's the case. I have my own theory. The death of Jesus was predicted thousands of years before Judas ever came along. And for the prophecy to be fulfilled, Jesus had to die. If he didn't, the gates of heaven couldn't be opened for mankind. I don't think, for an instant, Judas wanted to be the one, but... someone had to. Judas helped Jesus, so Jesus could die for our sins. Save us all. And I believe at this moment... Judas is in heaven, despite his sin, because it led to the greater good. (Beat) Relations prior to marriage is a sin. You and Sheryl are sinners in the Lord's eyes. And because of those sins, your souls are damned. But Ida and Me, we're gonna give you a chance to save your souls and do the right thing, but... as previously stated, you will need to persevere and show the strength and will of your character. But you'll do it. Because that's what needs to be done. 
Mike stares unflinching at Clyde. 
75   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                               75 
Deacon kneels before Sheryl who tries to move, but can't. 
ANGLE ON - Deacon lays his scarred hand on Sheryl's thigh. 
Sheryl squirms, but that's all she can do.       Then... 
IDA (O.S.) Deacon! 
Deacon jumps up, backs off. 
IDA You get away from her.    Git!   Now! 
Ida sets a tray she was carrying down, chases Deacon from the room. She shuts the door behind him. 
IDA I'm sorry about that, Sugar.     My brother, he's not well. 
She retrieves the tray, brings it over closer to Sheryl. 
IDA It's not all his fault. Our father wasn't very Christian and then there was the accident. Along with the scarring, lost use of his vocals. Can't speak a lick. Now, I've spoken to him. What happened with the others won't happen to you. He's promised me that. 
What others?   What did he do? 
IDA I'm gonna take that out of your mouth now. I brought you some tea, got some primrose in it. Help you relax, get some rest. Okay? 
Ida unties the gag in Sheryl's mouth. She coughs a few times. Ida raises the mug of tea to her lips... 
SHERYL Please don't do this. Please let me go. Please..I just want to go home.

Hardly able to catch her breath, her hair tangled, her nightgown torn, she drops the net.  She sits on the bed, turns on the bedside lamp and re-examines her room.  No one there but herself. 
It's a terrible blow, despite the fact that she's safe.  Her face is covered with tears, she's shaking and breathless.  She rattles her head in confusion and despair, realizing her own madness. 
NANCY I'm crazy after all... 
At that very instant FRED KRUEGER leaps up from the far side of the bed with an EXPLOSIVE SHOUT of rage! 
He lunges across the table for her, missing by inches as NANCY pitches backwards and scrambles for the window.  But she's stopped by the bars. 
KRUEGER, incredibly fast, regains his feet and leaps again -- the girl wheels and shatters the coffeepot over his head.  As he crashes backwards NANCY flings open the door of her room and dives through -- only to rebound off someone on the other side -- 
187.  INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             187. 
MARGE, knocked flying by NANCY'S charge, hits the floor hard, knocking the wind out of herself.  NANCY sees what she's done, jumps over the body and slams the door and throws the new bolt home.  Next instant she gingerly ties a string to the door's knob, a string that trails down from the ceiling, attached to something up there that's still just barely out of sight. 
Next instant she's dragging her MOTHER towards the woman's bedroom as fast as she can. 
KRUEGER is already splintering the doorway behind her as NANCY dips and makes it into MARGE's room, SLAMMING the DOOR behind her and locking it in a flash. 
The MANIAC breaks the bolt and rips open the door. 
But the in the very act of doing this he of course unknowingly pulls the string attached to the outside doorknob with terrific force. 
CLOSE ANGLE ON THE CEILING.  The string jerks against a single-edged razor, which in turn cuts a tight wind of cord holding a heavy wedge of steel to the ceiling. 
WIDER as the thing falls free, pivoting at the hinge at the far end of its handle, and drives straight into KRUEGER'S groin with a terrific blow.  As he catapaults backwards with an incredulous shriek, the twenty pound sledge hammer swings back and reveals to camera just what it is! 
ANGLE DOWN ON KRUEGER, clawwing his way up despite his agony, lurching and cursing forward like an enraged bull. 
WIDER ANGLE IN THE HALLWAY as KRUEGER roars out -- only to immediately strike the length of WIRE strung across the hallway, catching it just above the thigh.  He cartwheels head-over-heels and lands flat on his back! 
Instantly the DOOR to NANCY's MOTHER's bedroom flies open and NANCY brings a brass lamp down over KRUEGER's head with all her might!  It sounds like a line-drive caroming off a metal flagpole. 
NANCY SLAMS the DOOR as KRUEGER struggles up, clutching his head. 
Enraged, the huge man CRASHES against the door with terrific force, and rears back and starts smashing against the door like the utter homicidal lunatic that he is. 
CUT TO: 
188.  EXT.  ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                             188. 
HIGH ANGLE at the second floor level.  NANCY jerks open the window to her MOTHER's bedroom and jams her face to the bars. The AMBULANCE is pulling away with a tremendous WAIL of its SIREN as NANCY SCREAMS down, trying to make herself heard. 
NANCY Help!  Hey -- Daddy -- I got him trapped!  Where are you!? 
189.  ANGLE ON the street.  PARKER, assigned to guard the house, sees    189. NANCY -- hair white, eyes wide -- pounding on the bars and screaming like a lunatic.  But her meaning is utterly lost in the noise of the ambulance next to him. 
PARKER (yelling up at her) Everything's going to be all right!  Everything's under control! 
ANGLE at the window.  Close on NANCY's face, incredulous at his response. 
NANCY Get my father, you asshole! 
PARKER does a little take.  That almost sounded sane. 
PARKER (OS) You heard what I said!  Now get back inside or I'll tell your dad! 
191.  Behind her the DOOR SPLINTERS.  NANCY whirls around just in time   191. to see KRUEGER bull in!  NANCY's eyes go wide -- she's trapped against the bars and has nowhere to go.  The man bunches his knives into a single thick blade and rushes her, stabbing.  NANCY closes her eyes -- 
Then from OUT OF FRAME Marge leaps between the two. 
MARGE No! 
She blocks the charge perfectly -- blocking the knives. Both she and NANCY are slammed backwards against the bars behind. Drunk though she is, is hanging onto KRUEGER'S weapon hand, keeping the knives inside herself, away from her daughter! 
MARGE Nancy -- for god's sake's run! 
But NANCY turns to the window instead, screaming for her father. 
NANCY Daddy!  Where are you! 
192.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          192. 
PARKER, just about to turn back to the business at GLEN's house, sees NANCY and SOMEONE else fall just inside the window. Something begins to dawn on the man.  Just a little. 
PARKER Poor woman's got her hands full with that kid.  Maybe I better tell the lieutenant. 
He turns and jogs towards GLEN's house.

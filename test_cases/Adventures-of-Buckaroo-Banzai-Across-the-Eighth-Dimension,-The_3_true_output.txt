RENO God, if it's not one thing it's another. 
JOHN EMDALL But...because we're good guys, we're giving you a chance to save your planet.  Stop John Whorfin before sunrise! If you fail we will be forced to help you destroy yourselves.  End of discussion. 
There's an awful pause...and then a SCREECH as John Emdall spirals downward into the grooves of the record again. 
CASPER LINDLEY She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--? 
BUCKAROO BANZAI You wanna take the chance, Casper? 
CASPER LINDLEY Not me. No way. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car. 
SCOOTER LINDLEY Wow, you know it! 
Buckaroo heading for the door... 
RENO Where're you goin'? 
BUCKAROO BANZAI To get my guns. 
PERFECT TOMMY His guns?  Holy shit. 
INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	276 
...Professor Hikita and his assistant leaning over the electron tube apparatus, removing a rubber stopper from one of the receptacles, in the process GETTING AN ACCIDENTAL WHIFF of that BIZARRE GLOWING GREEN COMPOUND...Professor Hikita and assistant letting out gasps, seeing a sight that nearly stops their hearts... 
THEIR POV	277 
AT THE WINDOW...JOHN BIGBOOTÃ‰...AND A RED ARACHTOID! 
Professor Hikita, petrified, stepping back, grabbing the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER and knocking over a chair, as THE ALIEN CREATURE smashes the window! 
INT.  INSTITUTE CORRIDOR - NIGHT	279 
Rawhide, hearing screams from the Professor's laboratory, races down the corridor, gun drawn... 
INT.  BUCKAROO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT	280 
Buckaroo coming into his bedroom, opening a dresser drawer when suddenly...A NOISE BEHIND HIM!  Buckaroo whirling instinctively with twin EBONY HANDLED COLTS a fraction of a second from firing...at PENNY! 
...the latter poking her head out of Buckaroo's closet just long enough to see him aim his silver pistols, jumping back into the closet, slamming the door...an exasperated Buckaroo stepping over to the closet, finding it locked...knocking... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Open up or I'll shoot it off. 
PENNY PRIDDY I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me. 
Buckaroo understanding at last the reason for Penny's odd behavior, seeing THE PHOTOGRAPH on his bedstand of a younger, possibly not-yet- so-world-famous Buckaroo Banzai in tuxedo...his pretty companion A DEAD RINGER FOR PENNY. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Penny, look- 
PENNY'S VOICE You look.  Who is she? 
BUCKAROO BANZAI That's kinda complicated to get into right now because the world's maybe coming to an end and I can't stand here and talk to a closet door. 
PENNY'S VOICE Yeah, whose world is coming to an end?  You only wanted me because I remind you of her. 
Buckaroo fidgeting, precious seconds ticking away... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Penny, I was going to get into that, but I haven't had time...with arachtoids and all...but briefly she was your long lost twin sister, we got married, and that's about all I can say.  Right now. (no response) Penny? 
A silence from the other side, the closet door unlocking...slowly opening, revealing Penny standing in the middle of a pile of female clothing... 
PENNY PRIDDY Married--?  So that's it!  Buckaroo Banzai, a married man.  Where is she?  With the kids some place? 
Buckaroo turning...Penny eyeing him, penetrating his soul... 
PENNY PRIDDY She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you... 
BUCKAROO BANZAI She was killed, Penny. 
PENNY PRIDDY Oh, my. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight. 
A pregnant pause, the pain evident on Buckaroo's face as he turns back to the job at hand, picking up his holster and rummaging through the dresser drawer, fighting back the painful memories... 
PENNY PRIDDY Looks like you're the one might go to pieces. 
BUCKAROO BANZAI Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!

RHEYA That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying. 
KELVIN For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now. 
She realizes she doesn't want to argue.  Not right now, anyway. 
RHEYA I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from. (beat) I can't explain it. 
KELVIN Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before.  It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us. 
RHEYA But that's what happened before. 
KELVIN Not this time. 
He kisses her.  She wants to believe him, so she says nothing.  Then: 
RHEYA Do you want to stay here? 
KELVIN Do you? 
RHEYA If you're here. 
They kiss again... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM 
Kelvin is asleep.  Rheya is next to him. 
Offscreen, we hear the door open. 
Someone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through the frame and sits. 
After a long beat, Kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling to clear.  When it does: 
KELVIN Gibarian. 
GIBARIAN Leave the light off. 
A beat.  Kelvin tries to get his bearings. 
GIBARIAN I wish you'd come a little sooner. I might not have had to kill myself. 
He smiles, looking at Kelvin. 
GIBARIAN You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian. Just a new incarnation. 
KELVIN What do you want? 
GIBARIAN You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth. 
KELVIN Can it work? 
GIBARIAN It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours?  Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates. 
Kelvin registers this. 
GIBARIAN What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.

{"test1_input": "The scene begins again. Nicole is lifeless; she's merely saying the lines. \nNICOLE Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway -- \nCORA I was worried about Danny! \nNicole stops cold, completely thrown by Cora jumping her line. \nNICOLE I'm sorry, I'm lost... \nINT. SET APT. DAY. B/W \nNICK Cut. It's OK. No big deal. \nNick's voice has the rigid tremble of someone barely able to keep from screaming. \nNICK Everyone relax. We're just going to run the lines. That's all. No acting. Just run the lines. Then we're going to shoot this fucking scene. \nINT. SET APT. THE COUCH. DAY. B/W \nNicole gets up quietly and sits next to Cora on the couch, wordlessly taking her hand in hers. \nCORA (whispers) I'm so sorry. I'm fucking this up for you. \nNICOLE (whispers) Cora, don't even think that. You're doing great. I'm the one who's fucking it up. If I get through this I swear I'm never acting again. \nShe means it. Cora glances up at her, seeing for the first time how pain and defeat have drawn the life from Nicole's face. On an impulse Cora reaches out and gently lifts a strand of Nicole's hair from her eyes. \nA sudden amazed alarm fills Nicole. The living room grows strangely quiet. \nNICK (faintly, from a distance) And, action on the run-through. \nCU Nicole. She looks quickly toward Nick in confusion. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY. COLOR \nDISSOLVE to a nurse moving quickly past the camera and out the open door of the hospital room. \nCU Nicole, seated on the edge of the hospital bed. Still confused, she looks down at the old woman lying in the bed. The woman's face is pale and drawn. As Nicole leans closer her mother reaches out and gently brushes a strand of hair away from her face. The gesture is one of love, acceptance, and farewell. It is identical to the one we have just seen Cora make to her. \nNICK (V.O.) And action on the run-through. \nINT. SET APT. DAY. B/W \nWS, the Living Room Set. Nick, Wanda, the rest of the crew standing quietly. Nicole glances over at Cora and instantly something unspoken and unexplained passes between them. The run-through begins. \nFrom the moment Nicole opens her mouth it is obvious there has been a remarkable change in her. Every word now has the stunning clarity of truth. Cora is completely engulfed in the moment. \nNICOLE Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny. \nCORA Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever. \nNICOLE You were just standing there looking at me. \nAs Nicole continues, one by one the crew turn and watch this exquisite moment happening before them. Nick's face is lit with rapture. \nNICK (whispering) Roll camera... roll camera. \nHe glances over and to his horror sees that no one is behind the camera. He whispers frantically to the AC. \nNICK Where's Wolf? \nAC (whispers) In the bathroom... he doesn't feel good. \nNICK (whispers) Get him! Get him! \nNick turns back to the scene, watching its beauty now in agony. \nNICOLE Then you pulled me up and said, \"You're not hurt.\" Like I was disgusting for faking, for doing the only thing I could think of to keep him from hitting me again. \n", "test1_true": "NICOLE You do remember. \nCORA He was smaller than you. \nNICOLE You were so worried about Danny. What about me, Mom? Why weren't you worried about me? \nThere is a heavy, stunned silence as the scene ends. Nicole and Cora are in each other's arms. Pam and Cybil share a piece of tissue. CUT TO: an extreme CU of Nick. \nNICK Where the fuck is Wolf?!!! \nINT. BATHROOM. DAY. B/W \nIn the cramped confines of the dingy basement bathroom, Wolf pukes violently into the toilet. His face is pale and slick with perspiration. His eyes look upward toward the sound of Nick yelling. \nWOLF One second! \nWolf tries to continue but another spasm of nausea wrenches him back toward the toilet bowl. \nINT. SET APT. THE COUCH. DAY. B/W \nThe set is quiet, subdued. Nick sits on the couch with Nicole and Cora. Wolf sits groggily behind the camera wiping the sweat from his face. Wanda addresses the crew. \nWANDA OK, listen up. Nobody drinks the milk downstairs. OK? It appears to be bad. \nNick speaks uneasily to Nicole and Cora. He is a wreck and his insistent smile of encouragement looks absolutely demented. \nNICK I've had to, well I've changed the shot; we're just a little pressed for time. It'll just be a CU of Ellen for the last part of the scene, starting with Cora's \"I was worried about Danny.\" OK? I'll find a way to cut this into the fourth take. We almost had it. That was unbelievable, both of you. But let's not think about it. That moment is gone, and... we'll, we'll get another one. I have no doubt about it. OK? Here we go. \nNick walks over and stands beside the camera. \nINT. SET APT. BY THE CAMERA. DAY. B/W \nWOLF I'm ready, Nick. \nNick is so angry he can't even look at Wolf. \nNICK Call it, Wanda. \nWANDA And, roll sound. \nSOUND Speed! \nWANDA And, roll camera! \nAC Rolling! \nCLAPPER Scene six, Pickup, take one. (hits the sticks) \nNICK Action. \nINT. SET APT. THE SCENE: PICKUP 1. COLOR \nThe scene begins at the pickup point. Miraculously, both Cora and Nicole are just as concentrated and engaged as they were in the run-through. \nCORA I was worried about Danny. \nNICOLE You do remember. \nCORA He was smaller than you. \nNICOLE You were so worried about Danny. What about me, Mom? Why weren't -- \nIn the middle of this final, delicate moment an insistent electronic beeping is heard. \nINT. SET APT. DAY. B/W \nNICK CUT!!!! \n", "test1_id": 1407, "test2_input": "WANDA What the fuck is that?! Sound? \nSOUND (frantically checking his equipment) It's not me. \nBOOM It's the camera. \nWOLF The fuck it is. It's off; it's not even running. \nThe beep continues, growing louder. \nWANDA (into her walkie) What's going on down there?! Do I have a lock-up?! Nothing? You don't hear a beeping sound? (to Nick) The street's quiet. \nNICK Then what the fuck is it!!? \nAC It's somebody's watch! \nEverybody holds their watches up to their ears. \nWOLF Not mine. \nWANDA Not mine. \nSOUND Not mine. \nBOOM Not mine. \nAnd so on, until all watches have been checked with negative results. The beeping continues, growing louder and louder. \nSuddenly Nick loses it. He starts running around the set, ripping things apart, knocking over tables, lamps, chairs. He shoves Cora off the couch and whips off the cushions, heaving them against the wall with a startling violence. \nNICK Where is it!! You motherfucker! You cock-sucking motherfucking bastard! Where the fuck are you!? Where!! Where!! \nEveryone watches Nick demolish the set in stunned, open- mouthed amazement. Nick turns to the crew in rage. \nNICK Can someone help me please?! Do I have to do everything myself here?! \nNick loses it completely. \nNICK Hey, Cora. Why don't you go learn your lines! Hey Scriptgirl, are you finally going to pay attention here?! Hey, focus puller, you want to make a movie or get stoned?! Huh, I got some great fuckin' Thai Stick here! Hey Wolf, you pretentious, beret- wearing motherfucker! I saw your reel, man; it sucked! Who the hell would hire you anyway! Hey Wanda, next time can you wear a shirt that's a little more distracting to my actors! (to the Gaffer) Hey Bob! Hi Bob! Can you please make a little more noise on the dolly you creaky motherfucker! (to Cybil) What is your name!? What do you fucking do around here?! (to the Soundman) Hey Speedo, what's the matter? Can't even find a teeny fucking beep?! \nCU of Nicole. She turns away, unable to watch anymore. The beeping continues. \nNICK See what I have to put up with, Nicole!? Maybe next time you'll do some of that magic on camera!? But no, no -- wait till Wolf is puking his guts out, \"Oh now I'll be good!!\" \nWS, the entire room. Nick's last word echoes throughout the silent set. Suddenly he stops in the center of the demolished set and lets out a long, wrenching scream. \nINT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. COLOR \nQUICK CUT TO extreme CU Nick's face, just as his eyes open. The film is in COLOR now. The room is in heavy darkness except for the light on Nick's face. Nick reaches over and shuts off his clock radio. The digital dial shows 4:00 A.M. The beeping finally stops. \nNick turns on a light and sits up in bed, drenched in sweat and still breathing heavily. \nNICK God... (this is not a sigh of relief) \nThe camera DOLLIES swiftly back away from Nick. He stares at it in stunned amazement. Just then a DOOR closes right into the lens turning the frame into complete BLACKNESS. \nOut of the BLACKNESS a door opens away from the camera revealing WANDA looking into her closet (the camera is inside the closet). From this point on, the rest of the film is in COLOR except where specifically indicated to be Black and White. \nINT. WANDA'S APT. DAWN \nShe is wearing only a bra, black stretch pants, and cowboy boots. She rummages quickly through some blouses, selects the same garish one she wore in Part One, then walks away revealing WOLF sitting on the edge of the rumpled bed. He is dressed exactly the same as when we last saw him, complete with beret. He struggles groggily into his socks and boots. The entire apartment is in disarray. A bedside clock reads 4:13 A.M. \nWOLF Well, when did he ask you? \nWANDA Yesterday, when I was helping him check into his hotel. \nWOLF What, the guy can't even check into a hotel by himself? \nWANDA Listen, Wolf, having Chad Palomino in this movie will benefit us all. If being there when he checks into his hotel makes him feel better, then I'm happy to do it. \n", "test2_true": "WANDA He asked me if I liked jazz, I said yes, and he suggested we meet tonight at a jazz club. \nWOLF I like jazz. \nWANDA He did not invite you. (applies perfume) \nWOLF Why are you wearing perfume to work? \nWANDA Because I feel like it. \nWOLF You didn't wear it yesterday. \nWANDA Oh, stop it. You're acting like a child. \nWanda playfully swipes at Wolf's face with a negligee she is returning to the closet. It misses him completely. \nWOLF My eye! \nWANDA Oh, God. Sweetheart, are you alright? \nWOLF Do I look alright?! \nWANDA Let me see. Christ, we're going to be late. \nWanda sits and perfunctorily examines Wolf's eye. \nINT. CAR. DAWN \nThe car is parked outside a rather seedy hotel. JEFF, the Intern and NICK, the Director, sit quietly in the motionless car. \nNICK Should we call up to the room again? \nJEFF He said he'd be right down. \nNick lets out a huge yawn. \nJEFF Tired? \nNICK I'm exhausted. I dreamt I was on the set all night. I was just trying to do one shot and everything kept going wrong. \nJEFF That's an anxiety dream. Are you anxious about something? \nNICK I don't know. Sometimes I wonder what the hell I'm doing in this business. It's all just one compromise and disappointment after another. I don't know if I have the personality for it. \nJEFF Sounds kind of like an identity crisis. \nNICK Maybe you're right. Who am I? What am I really capable of? Maybe I should just get a job teaching at a women's college somewhere. \nJEFF How'd you get into cinematography? \nNICK I'm not a cinematographer. \nJEFF You're not? \nNICK No. I'm directing this movie. \nJEFF (pause) How'd you get into directing? \nINT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN \nIn the dim light of the hotel room, CHAD PALOMINO dresses quickly. He is young, handsome, with long blond hair. A WOMAN sits nude on the bed, her back to the camera. The faint sound of a shower comes from the adjacent bathroom. \nPALOMINO They're waiting downstairs. \nWOMAN Go ahead, I'll take a taxi. \nPALOMINO Oh, OK. Listen, I've got to tell you, I had a lot of fun last night, really, but for me, where I'm at right now in my life, a relationship is... \n", "test2_id": 1408, "test3_input": "CORA (testily) Of course I knew you were filming. \nNICK You were great, you're a natural. And Nicole, that was beautiful. Don't you dare tell me that felt fake. \nSuddenly, on an impulse surprising both of them, Nick and Nicole embrace. Just then Wanda steps up. \nWANDA Going again, Nick? \nNICK Oh, hold on. Let me think a second. \nThe set grows suddenly quiet as Nick begins pacing rapidly, muttering to himself. \nNICK Can I use it for the Dream Sequence, that's the question. Does it work for the Dream Sequence? \nNick suddenly looks up and sees everybody staring at him; Nicole in her wedding gown, Wolf with his eyepatch, his mother still eating the apple, Wanda, the crew. \nNICK We're going with it, Wanda! \nWANDA Alright everyone, listen up. That is a wrap on Scene Six. \nThe set erupts in applause. \nSOUND Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! \nWANDA What?! \nSOUND I need to record room tone. I'll need thirty seconds of silence. \nWANDA Oh, alright! Quiet. Quiet! Shut up!! Thirty seconds of room tone. The sooner you're quiet the sooner we're done. \nCORA (whispers to Nick) What's room tone? \nNICK It's for the sound, Mom. We just have to be quiet. \nAt that moment a door opens at the rear of the set and a DOCTOR and NURSE enter. The Nurse carries an extra overcoat. Jeff, the Driver, turns and sternly whispers for them to be quiet. \nWANDA And roll sound. Nobody move. \nSOUND Speed. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nThe camera is wide, showing the entire set, actors, and crew. Everyone stands in perfect silence, as motionless as statues. As the silence continues the mood on the set gradually changes. One by one people drift into their own private worlds of reflection. \nMS the Sound man, alternately watching his recorder and his stopwatch. Behind him the Boom man holds the mike in position to record general ambiance while staring off into the distance. \nCU the tape recorder spinning in quiet precision. \nCU the stopwatch, its giant second hand showing five seconds have passed. \nMS Nick standing next to his mother who drapes one arm casually over Nick's shoulder. Nick glances up and sees Nicole beside him, absorbed in her own thoughts. Suddenly she looks up and her eyes meet Nick's. She slips him the barest hint of a smile. \nThe camera DOLLIES slowly through the standing, silent group, passing over faces in different degrees of thought. \nCU the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing ten seconds have passed. \nMS Nick. He is so immersed in thought he looks at no one. The camera slowly DOLLIES into a CU of him. \nINT. AN AWARDS CEREMONY \nCHAD PALOMINO stands at a gleaming podium, looking radiant in an immaculate tuxedo. He holds an envelope in his hands. \nCHAD We have a new category this year: Best Film Ever Made by a Human Being. And the winner is none other than my Best Bud, Nick Reve! \nAmid thunderous applause Nick bounds on the stage and accepts an Oscar from Chad. He stands grinning like an idiot as the applause continues. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nMS Nick, still wrapped in thought, his lips starting to form the same idiotic smile. MS Nicole. The camera DOLLIES slowly into her face, now tinged with a slight uneasiness. \n", "test3_true": "Wide shot at the counter. Nicole stands facing a large bald man with his back to the camera. She is wearing a cheap pink waitress uniform and has her hair under a hairnet. \nMAN Had any experience? \nNICOLE I was an actress for a while. \nShe pulls her headshot out of her shoulder bag and hands it to the man with a hopeful smile. He flips over the headshot and looks at her credits with confused annoyance. \nMAN Yeah, but can you cook a hamburger? \nNICOLE (doubtfully) Probably. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nMS Nicole. She jerks her head slightly in response to this moment of thought. \nCU the stopwatch, showing fifteen seconds have passed. \nMS Wolf. The camera begins a slow DOLLY into his CU. \nINT. WANDA'S APT. DAY \nWolf stands like Thor in the middle of the Red Set, his arms crossed over his chest, his jaw set in determination. Smoke billows around him. At his feet, dressed in Nicole's wedding gown, Wanda sobs hysterically. \nWANDA Wolf, I'm sorry! Please forgive me! I love you, Wolf! Please! Give me one more chance. Let me prove it! I love you! I love you, Wolf! \nWolf remains unmoved for a long moment. Finally he reaches out with a forgiving smile and pats Wanda's head. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nMS Wolf. He glances furtively at Wanda with a trace of hope still in his eyes. \nMS Wanda, looking off. The camera DOLLIES into her CU. \nINT. A CHEAP HOTEL ROOM \nThis is the same hotel room from Part Two, in which we saw Nicole and Chad Palomino. At the moment Wanda and Chad lie panting in the sweat-soaked sheets. \nWANDA What I love about you, Chad, is you're not afraid of my power. \nCHAD Oh God, Wanda! I love your power. It's like an afferdesiac to me! \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nMS Wanda. She shifts slightly and glances quickly around her. Her smile is tinged with the hint of sexual pleasure. \nMS the Gaffer, frowning, absorbed in thought. The camera DOLLIES into a CU of him. \nINT. A CHEAP RESTAURANT. DAY \nSuddenly, a CU of an incredibly beautiful hamburger being placed in a toasted bun on a gleaming white oval plate. A hand places a garnish of parsley on it then carries the plate to the lunch counter. Camera PANS to reveal the GAFFER sitting on the stool. He picks up the hamburger and takes a huge bite out of it. This shot holds for quite some time as he continues to chew. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nMS The Gaffer. A hopeful, delicious smile spreading over his face. \nCU the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing twenty seconds have passed. \nMS Cora. She gazes serenely out before her. \nINT. NURSING HOME. DAY \nIn the pale afternoon light, Cora stands in the middle of her drab, barren room. She appears to be staring at the door. Suddenly she begins striding toward it. Effortlessly, easily, she walks right through it. \nINT. AN AWARDS CEREMONY \nNick still stands at the podium with his Oscar. \n", "test3_id": 1409}

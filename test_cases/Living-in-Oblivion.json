{"train": "\"LIVING IN OBLIVION\" \nScreenplay by \nTom DiCillo \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nA battered 35mm movie camera stands alone on a wooden tripod surrounded by blackness. Opening credits begin. An almost imperceptible DOLLY in toward the movie camera. The dolly forward continues throughout the credits ending in an EXTREME CU of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant, glass full moon. Fade to BLACK. \nSuddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping the lens and revealing the following scene in Black and White. \nEXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT \nA quiet, deserted industrial street. It is over an hour before dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness of night. \nIn the weak light filtering out of their battered van, BERT and CYBIL -- the Craft Service Managers, finish setting out breakfast supplies on a 6' table. They work in almost complete silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. A cheap walkie- talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters and buzzes occasionally. Other items on the table include a mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered donuts. \nBERT What time is it? \nCYBIL Four. Why? \nBERT This milk is bad. \nCYBIL (sniffs) When did you buy it? \nBERT Tuesday? I don't know. What's today? \nCYBIL Monday. (pause) There's a deli on Broadway. \nBERT Nothing closer? \nCYBIL Nothing that's open. \nBERT (sniffs the milk) Is it that bad? \nCYBIL I don't know. You're the one who said it was bad. \nAt that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and shudders to a stop in front of the building. Bert replaces the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice. \nEXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT. B/W \nAmid low, one-word greetings, the CREW tumbles out of the trucks and stands in a groggy cluster around the Craft Service table. WOLF -- the Cameraman, assumes a place of prominence. He wears a black leather coat, a black beret, and black leather half-fingered gloves. \nWOLF This is the worst fucking coffee I've had in my life. \nCYBIL Then don't drink it. \nGAFFER What're we doing today? \nWOLF (pulls out a wrinkled callsheet) \"Interior. Living Room. Ellen talks to Mom.\" \nAC Any nudity? \nCYBIL Yeah, you have to take your fucking pants off. \nAC I'll do it. I like Ellen. \nGAFFER Yeah, she's a babe. She was the nurse in that Richard Gere movie. \nBERT I worked on that. \nAC The shower scene. \nWOLF Start with the 5K in the window. Run feeders for three blonds into the living room. \nGAFFER Two people. Sitting? Standing? \nWOLF Who fuckin' knows? \nWANDA Wolf! \nWOLF Two seconds, Wanda. \nWANDA No. No more tweaking. Picture's up. (into her walkie) Lock it up! \nWolf quickly motions Gaffer to hand-hold the scrim in front of the 5K. \nWANDA And, roll sound. \nSOUND Speed! \nWANDA Roll camera! \nAC Rolling! \nCLAPPER Scene six, take five. (hits the sticks) \nNICK Action. \nINT. SET APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 5. COLOR \nOnce again the scene begins. Nicole shows the first signs of losing her concentration. \nNICOLE Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny. \nCORA Ellen, I have no memory -- \nSuddenly there is a tremendous EXPLOSION sending bits of glass flying through the frame. Cora jumps, clutching her chest. \nCORA Oh, God! \nINT. SET APT. DAY. B/W \nCU the light the Gaffer had been holding the scrim before. It is smoking and shattered. \nNICK Jesus fucking Christ! \nWOLF (to the Gaffer) Kill it. Kill it. Pull the plug. Right there by your foot. \nWANDA That's a cut. Anybody hurt? Cora, are you alright? \nCora nods wordlessly, gasping for breath. \nWANDA Props. Props! Let's get a broom up here right away. Clear the set! \nINT. APT. HALLWAY. DAY. B/W \nNick, Cora, and Nicole stand in a corner of the landing. Nick is making obvious attempts to lighten the mood. \nNICK Well, let's see. What do you think is going to happen next, Cora? \nCORA I'm going to have a heart attack! \nNICK No, you're not. You're going in there in two minutes and we are really going to nail this scene. I know it. I have no doubt about it. Nicole... \nNick turns to Nicole and stops in midsentence. He looks at her for a long moment. Nicole returns his gaze then suddenly looks away. \nWANDA (V.O.) Nick! Nick! \nNICK One second! \nNick hesitates a moment then rushes back to the set. \nCORA I'll tell you this much right now; I am never, ever doing another fucking low-budget movie. \nINT. SET APT. DAY. B/W \nNick joins Wanda and Wolf on the set couch and chair. \nThe scene begins again. Nicole is lifeless; she's merely saying the lines. \nNICOLE Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway -- \nCORA I was worried about Danny! \nNicole stops cold, completely thrown by Cora jumping her line. \nNICOLE I'm sorry, I'm lost... \nINT. SET APT. DAY. B/W \nNICK Cut. It's OK. No big deal. \nNick's voice has the rigid tremble of someone barely able to keep from screaming. \nNICK Everyone relax. We're just going to run the lines. That's all. No acting. Just run the lines. Then we're going to shoot this fucking scene. \nINT. SET APT. THE COUCH. DAY. B/W \nNicole gets up quietly and sits next to Cora on the couch, wordlessly taking her hand in hers. \nCORA (whispers) I'm so sorry. I'm fucking this up for you. \nNICOLE (whispers) Cora, don't even think that. You're doing great. I'm the one who's fucking it up. If I get through this I swear I'm never acting again. \nShe means it. Cora glances up at her, seeing for the first time how pain and defeat have drawn the life from Nicole's face. On an impulse Cora reaches out and gently lifts a strand of Nicole's hair from her eyes. \nA sudden amazed alarm fills Nicole. The living room grows strangely quiet. \nNICK (faintly, from a distance) And, action on the run-through. \nCU Nicole. She looks quickly toward Nick in confusion. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM. DAY. COLOR \nDISSOLVE to a nurse moving quickly past the camera and out the open door of the hospital room. \nCU Nicole, seated on the edge of the hospital bed. Still confused, she looks down at the old woman lying in the bed. The woman's face is pale and drawn. As Nicole leans closer her mother reaches out and gently brushes a strand of hair away from her face. The gesture is one of love, acceptance, and farewell. It is identical to the one we have just seen Cora make to her. \nNICK (V.O.) And action on the run-through. \nINT. SET APT. DAY. B/W \nWS, the Living Room Set. Nick, Wanda, the rest of the crew standing quietly. Nicole glances over at Cora and instantly something unspoken and unexplained passes between them. The run-through begins. \nFrom the moment Nicole opens her mouth it is obvious there has been a remarkable change in her. Every word now has the stunning clarity of truth. Cora is completely engulfed in the moment. \nNICOLE Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny. \nCORA Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever. \nNICOLE You were just standing there looking at me. \nAs Nicole continues, one by one the crew turn and watch this exquisite moment happening before them. Nick's face is lit with rapture. \nNICK (whispering) Roll camera... roll camera. \nHe glances over and to his horror sees that no one is behind the camera. He whispers frantically to the AC. \nNICK Where's Wolf? \nAC (whispers) In the bathroom... he doesn't feel good. \nNICK (whispers) Get him! Get him! \nNick turns back to the scene, watching its beauty now in agony. \nNICOLE Then you pulled me up and said, \"You're not hurt.\" Like I was disgusting for faking, for doing the only thing I could think of to keep him from hitting me again. \nWANDA What the fuck is that?! Sound? \nSOUND (frantically checking his equipment) It's not me. \nBOOM It's the camera. \nWOLF The fuck it is. It's off; it's not even running. \nThe beep continues, growing louder. \nWANDA (into her walkie) What's going on down there?! Do I have a lock-up?! Nothing? You don't hear a beeping sound? (to Nick) The street's quiet. \nNICK Then what the fuck is it!!? \nAC It's somebody's watch! \nEverybody holds their watches up to their ears. \nWOLF Not mine. \nWANDA Not mine. \nSOUND Not mine. \nBOOM Not mine. \nAnd so on, until all watches have been checked with negative results. The beeping continues, growing louder and louder. \nSuddenly Nick loses it. He starts running around the set, ripping things apart, knocking over tables, lamps, chairs. He shoves Cora off the couch and whips off the cushions, heaving them against the wall with a startling violence. \nNICK Where is it!! You motherfucker! You cock-sucking motherfucking bastard! Where the fuck are you!? Where!! Where!! \nEveryone watches Nick demolish the set in stunned, open- mouthed amazement. Nick turns to the crew in rage. \nNICK Can someone help me please?! Do I have to do everything myself here?! \nNick loses it completely. \nNICK Hey, Cora. Why don't you go learn your lines! Hey Scriptgirl, are you finally going to pay attention here?! Hey, focus puller, you want to make a movie or get stoned?! Huh, I got some great fuckin' Thai Stick here! Hey Wolf, you pretentious, beret- wearing motherfucker! I saw your reel, man; it sucked! Who the hell would hire you anyway! Hey Wanda, next time can you wear a shirt that's a little more distracting to my actors! (to the Gaffer) Hey Bob! Hi Bob! Can you please make a little more noise on the dolly you creaky motherfucker! (to Cybil) What is your name!? What do you fucking do around here?! (to the Soundman) Hey Speedo, what's the matter? Can't even find a teeny fucking beep?! \nCU of Nicole. She turns away, unable to watch anymore. The beeping continues. \nNICK See what I have to put up with, Nicole!? Maybe next time you'll do some of that magic on camera!? But no, no -- wait till Wolf is puking his guts out, \"Oh now I'll be good!!\" \nWS, the entire room. Nick's last word echoes throughout the silent set. Suddenly he stops in the center of the demolished set and lets out a long, wrenching scream. \nINT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. COLOR \nQUICK CUT TO extreme CU Nick's face, just as his eyes open. The film is in COLOR now. The room is in heavy darkness except for the light on Nick's face. Nick reaches over and shuts off his clock radio. The digital dial shows 4:00 A.M. The beeping finally stops. \nNick turns on a light and sits up in bed, drenched in sweat and still breathing heavily. \nNICK God... (this is not a sigh of relief) \nThe camera DOLLIES swiftly back away from Nick. He stares at it in stunned amazement. Just then a DOOR closes right into the lens turning the frame into complete BLACKNESS. \nOut of the BLACKNESS a door opens away from the camera revealing WANDA looking into her closet (the camera is inside the closet). From this point on, the rest of the film is in COLOR except where specifically indicated to be Black and White. \nINT. WANDA'S APT. DAWN \nShe is wearing only a bra, black stretch pants, and cowboy boots. She rummages quickly through some blouses, selects the same garish one she wore in Part One, then walks away revealing WOLF sitting on the edge of the rumpled bed. He is dressed exactly the same as when we last saw him, complete with beret. He struggles groggily into his socks and boots. The entire apartment is in disarray. A bedside clock reads 4:13 A.M. \nWOLF Well, when did he ask you? \nWANDA Yesterday, when I was helping him check into his hotel. \nWOLF What, the guy can't even check into a hotel by himself? \nWANDA Listen, Wolf, having Chad Palomino in this movie will benefit us all. If being there when he checks into his hotel makes him feel better, then I'm happy to do it. \nWOMAN Chad; hold it. This was a one-time deal. You know it, I know it. There is no need for melodrama. \nPALOMINO I just thought you might... \nWOMAN Look, all I ask is that you don't mention this to anyone. \nPALOMINO Hey, that's not my style. \nWOMAN Good. \nPALOMINO So, I'll see you on the set. \nPalomino slips out the door. The woman falls back onto the bed, turning her face toward the camera. We see it is NICOLE. \nNICOLE God damn it. \nShe lies for a moment, listening to the sound of the shower. The bedside clock reads 4:30 A.M. \nINT. CAR. DAWN \nThe car pulls up outside a NYC apt building. Jeff, Nick, and Palomino sit inside. \nPALOMINO I got two films coming up right after yours, Nick. One I play a rapist that Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love with. The other I'm kind of a sexy serial killer who shacks up with Winona Ryder. \nNICK That's great, man. \nPALOMINO Yeah, but I'm not into that hostess twinkie shit, Nick. \nNICK Hostess twinkie? \nPALOMINO That Hollywood shit. It's all fluff, man. These are the kind of movies I want to do, right here. \nNICK I'm glad you feel that way, Chad. And I just want to tell you, I'm really happy we can work together. \nPALOMINO Hey, me too! You're a great director, man. Your films are wacked! And I'm gonna be watching you, buddy. Like a hawk. I want to learn from you, Nick. I'm gonna pick your brain. \nNICK Good. Then you can pick my nose. \nPALOMINO (big laugh) See what I mean? You're wacked. Hey, what are we sitting here for? \nNICK We're waiting for Nicole. \nPALOMINO Nicole? She's takin' a tax -- (he stops) \nNICK What? \nPALOMINO Probably taking a shower or something. Hey, how was her shower scene in that Richard Gere movie? \nNICK Good. \nJEFF Really great. \nThe three men sit in silence. WS, showing the car parked outside Nicole's apt, the men inside waiting. \nINT. THE SET. MORNING \nA small, elegant bedroom set has been constructed in the middle of the huge empty space. One wall has a fake window. The GAFFER lies on the bed staring absently at the AC sitting motionless beside the camera a few feet away. Neither speaks for a long moment. \nGAFFER I think we got nudity today. \nAC (reads from his callsheet) It just says \"Scene Six: Ellen and Damian kiss.\" \nGAFFER Could be a kiss with nudity. \nAC I like Ellen. She's my type. \nGAFFER Why is that? \nAC She's pretty. Smart. Kind of kooky. \nWANDA Hold it down, hold it down, people. Actors working. \nPALOMINO Great shirt, Wanda. \nWANDA (big smile) Why, thank you, Chad. \nNICK OK, let's work out the rest of this blocking. Wolf -- (notices Wolf's eyepatch) What happened to your eye? \nWOLF A little accident. \nNICK You going to be alright? \nWOLF I think so. \nPALOMINO It looks good on you, man. \nNICK Nicole is standing here, Chad, you're there by the chair. Camera is close on Ellen: her first line. \nNICOLE I've always admired you from afar. \nPALOMINO Admired? That sounds rather professional. \nNICK Good! \"Professional,\" that's the cue; Damian steps up to the bed. Camera pulls back. The scene continues. \nNICOLE Well, then: loved. How does that sound? \nPALOMINO It sounds like the champagne talking. \nNICOLE I've loved you from the moment we met. \nPALOMINO Why didn't you tell me? \nNICOLE We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere. \nPALOMINO God. And all this time I thought... \nNICK Then the kiss. How's that feel? \nPALOMINO Great. \nNICK Nicole? \nNICOLE Good. \nNICK Wolf, any thoughts? \nWOLF Nope. \nPALOMINO I've got a thought. What about Damian having an eyepatch like Wolf's? \nNICK Let me think about that one, Chad. \nPALOMINO OK, you're the genius. Nick Reve, Living in Oblivion, Scene Six, Take One. Let's shoot it! \nNICK One second, Chad. You ready for one, Wolf? \nWOLF Hell, I been ready. \nPALOMINO Alright, Wolfman. \nNICK Good. Call it, Wanda. \nWANDA Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound. \nSOUND Speed! \nWANDA Roll camera! \nAC Rolling! \nNICK Nicole? \nNICOLE I understand, Chief. \nNICK Good. Here we go. Call it, Wanda. \nWANDA Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound. \nSOUND Speed! \nWANDA Roll camera! \nAC Rolling! \nCLAPPER Scene six, take two! \nNICK And, action. \nINT. THE SCENE. TAKE TWO. DAY \nNICOLE I've always admired you from afar. \nPalomino moves immediately to the bed, changing his blocking and causing the camera crew and Nicole considerable confusion. \nPALOMINO Admired? That sounds rather professional. \nNICOLE Well, then: loved. How does that sound? \nPALOMINO It sounds like the champagne talking. \nNICOLE I've loved you from the moment we met. \nPALOMINO Why didn't you tell me? \nNICOLE We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere. \nPALOMINO God. And all this time I thought... \nThe scene once again is awful. Nick gives their listless kiss a few moments then calls CUT. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nNICK And, cut. Very good. Wolf? \nWOLF Chad missed his cue again; the whole dolly is unusable. \nNICK Yeah, Chad. What happened; I thought you were going to hold back till \"me\"? \nPALOMINO The more I thought about it the more it didn't seem right. And I'm thinking, watch me here, instead of coming around the bed, what if I just slip here like this and do the whole scene lying down? \nNICK I don't know, that seems a little... \nPALOMINO Hey, I'm just throwing out ideas here. Trying to get the juices flowing. \nNICK Nicole, how does that feel to you? \nNICOLE Well, I can turn to look at him. But won't you be shooting the back of my head? \nWOLF Plus Chad is completely out of the light down there. \nPALOMINO Hey, Wolf; I'm not worried about my face, man. It's about the acting; that's all I care about. \nWOLF It's your call, Nick. His acting or his face. \nNICK For some reason I was hoping we could get both. (laughs) I thought that's what we were trying to do here. \nWOLF I'll have to set another light. \nWANDA We're ahead of schedule, Nick. I think we can afford a few minutes to set a light for Mr. Palomino. \nNICK Yeah, I think the lying on the bed is not quite working, Chad. Let's try one with the original blocking. \nPALOMINO Which one was that? There's been so many damn changes. Could somebody help me out please? \nSCRIPT The cue for the original blocking is \"professional.\" \nPALOMINO (intimate) Thank you. Thank you very much. \nNICK OK, right away. Call it, Wanda. \nNICOLE Nick? Could I just have a moment? Is that alright? \nNICK Of course, Nicole; are you kidding? Hold the roll, Wanda. \nWANDA Holding the roll! \nNicole remains seated on the bed, lowering her head and closing her eyes as she attempts to generate some emotion for the scene. Everyone watches her in complete silence. \nINT. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAY \nPalomino tiptoes over to the camera where Wanda and the Scriptgirl are standing side by side. As he leans between them, checking his lines on the Scriptgirl's script, he inhales deeply then exhales with a barely audible sigh. \nPALOMINO (whispers) Someone over here smells very, very nice. \nThinking he means her, Wanda's lips flutter in a brief, involuntary smile. Meanwhile, the Scriptgirl turns away, blushing furiously. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nPalomino tiptoes again back to his spot. Nicole raises her head and nods once to Nick. She seems to have aroused some real emotion in herself. \nNICK (with quiet intensity) Call it, Wanda. \nWANDA And roll sound. \nSOUND Speed! \nWANDA Roll camera! \nAC Rolling! \nCLAPPER Scene six, take four! \nPALOMINO (suddenly) Nick, I just had a great idea! \nWANDA Hold the roll! \nNICK What is it, Chad? \nPALOMINO Just stop me if I'm out of line here, but she says \"admired from afar,\" right? Doesn't it make sense to see Damian up close and her \"afar?\" You start on a Close-up of Damian, watch me here; as she declares her love, the camera moves with me into this primo two-shot that you and the Wolfmeister have set up here. \nNICK What do you think, Wolf? \nWOLF I don't like it. This is Ellen's scene. \nNICK I don't know; it sort of makes sense. \nPALOMINO Hey, you did it, man. It's all there in the writing. \nWOLF I'd have to relight. \nNick pauses, thinking hard. \nWANDA We're still ahead of schedule, Nick; if that means anything to you. \nNICK Let's do it. \nWOLF (to the Gaffer) Get me a tweenie right here, with diffusion. \nWANDA OK, everyone stand by. We're pausing briefly to set one little light, then we're going again, right away. Stand-in please for Mr. Palomino. \nPALOMINO Maurice! Hey, Maurice Chevalier! Any relation? Probably not. Hey, smoking crew guys, really. \nThe Gaffer slips his own script out of his back pocket and begins leafing through it. \nGAFFER Hey thanks, Chad. Actually I wrote a script. \nPALOMINO Oh, yeah? \nPalomino takes the Gaffer's script and holds it up to his eyes, shading them from a light he's looking at across the room. He points to the light. \nPALOMINO Hey, Bill. See that light over there? \nGAFFER Uh, yeah. \nPALOMINO Lower it about three feet. \nPalomino hands the Gaffer back his script and walks off. The Gaffer and AC stand in silence for a long awkward moment. \nINT. BATHROOM. DAY \nNick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror. Leaning closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his hair falls over his ear, then steps back to examine himself. \nNICK Would you care to have a drink tonight? Hey, Nicole, what do you say you and I have a drink tonight? \nSuddenly the door opens behind him and Nicole walks in. \nNICOLE Oh, Nick! I'm sorry! \nNICK That's OK, no problem. I'm just slapping a little water on my face. \nThe two stand in embarrassed silence for a moment. Nick looks like he's gathering the nerve to ask her out. \nNICK So, it's going pretty good, huh? \nNICOLE Is it? Something feels off. \nNICK Yeah, you seem a little tense. \nNICOLE Do I? \nNICK But don't worry about it. Just take your attention off yourself and put it on Chad. Work off him a little more. \nNICOLE OK, I'll try that. \nNICK And listen, I know he's no Olivier. But he's got something, don't you think? Kind of a natural presence. \nNICOLE Oh yes, he's very natural. \nNick hesitates, again gathering his nerves to pop the question. \nNICK So Nicole... anything else I can help you with? \nNICOLE Actually there is. Could you maybe ask him to brush his teeth? \nNICK Oh, sure. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nWanda crosses the set and assumes her position beside the camera. Wolf sits behind it, barely a foot away. \nWOLF My eye is killing me. \nWANDA Put your eyepatch on. \nWOLF I lost it. \nWANDA Is that little light set yet? \nWOLF That little light was set ten minutes ago. \nNicole stays seated, though Palomino moves around making a great show of loosening up. \nNICOLE I've always admired you from afar. \nPALOMINO Have you? That's, wow; that's incredible. But that sounds kind of professional doesn't it? Admired? \nNICOLE You're right. How does despised sound? \nPALOMINO Great! (laughs) What's it mean? \nNICOLE (laughs) It's sort of like I think you're a piece of shit. \nPalomino is somewhat startled by this. He looks to Nick in confusion. Nick silently encourages him to keep going. \nPALOMINO (another laugh) That sounds like the champagne talking. \nNICOLE It's not. I really do think you are a piece of shit. \nPALOMINO No, you don't. You love me. \nNICOLE The fuck I do. I can't stand looking at you! \nPALOMINO Then I guess I have nothing else to say. \nNICOLE No, I think you have a lot more to say, Damian. \nPALOMINO Well, I am surprised you feel this way, Ellen. I always thought you admired -- \nNICOLE That's not what I meant. You should tell everyone what you just told Nick behind the set. \nPALOMINO Hey, this isn't part of the scene. \nNICOLE Say it anyway: The reason this scene isn't working is because you and I slept together last night. Did everyone hear that?! I fucked Chad last night! \nNick and the rest of the crew stand in stunned amazement. \nPALOMINO See, Nick! I told you this was about rejection! \nNICOLE You fucking scumbag! You think I give a rat's ass about you?! I was there to get laid and even that was a joke! \nPALOMINO You know, you are really starting to piss me off! \nNICOLE Oh, does that mean you're not going to come wiggle on the bed anymore, or stroke my hair real soft and concerned, or kiss me like a soap opera acting piece of shit! \nPalomino snaps, and lunges for Nicole. She leaps to the other side of the bed. \nNICOLE Come on! I'll kick your ass! Come on! \nNick steps between Nicole and Palomino. \nNICK OK, guys, I think we can stop there. \nPALOMINO You bet your ass we can stop! Wanda, call me a cab! \nNICK Hold on, Chad. Let's just try to calm down. \nPALOMINO Fuck you. I'm out of here, man. This movie is bullshit. \nNICK Now wait a second, Chad. There's no reason for hostility. \nPALOMINO Shut up, you fucking loser. The only reason I took this part was because someone said you knew Quentin Tarantino! You're nowhere, man. \nNICK Hey, you want to go? Go! I'm sick of your shit, you hostess twinkie motherfucker! \nPALOMINO What'd you call me? \nNICK You heard me. \nPALOMINO Say it again. \nNICOLE Why didn't you tell me? \nNICK I didn't want anything to get in the way of us working together. \nNICOLE God, and all this time I thought... \nNick and Nicole move into a shy, trembling, heartfelt kiss. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN \nNicole snaps awake with a jolt. She glances quickly at the clock which reads 4:35. The sound of the shower still running in the bathroom. \nNICOLE Oh, God. \nNicole leaps out of bed and races into the bathroom. As the camera follows her, she closes the bathroom door, right against the lens, turning the image to total BLACKNESS. \nThe frame is BLACK. The recognizable clatter and clunk of the FILM CREW is heard. Wanda's voice is prominent. \nWANDA Don't go out that door! \nSuddenly a DOOR opens away from camera and the AC stops, a foot away from the lens. Behind him, Wanda and the rest of the crew can be seen through the door, preparing for filming. We see now the door and the plywood walls around it are FAKE. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nAC Why not? \nWANDA It's part of the set, goddamnit. Now go around. \nAC Next time. This is an emergency. \nThe AC rushes past and a moment later the camera DOLLIES slowly through the fake door toward Wanda pacing near the set camera. \nWANDA (into her walkie) Has Ellen showed up yet? \nWALKIE ssss... kkkkkrrk. \nWANDA Get her into wardrobe right away. \nWALKIE ssskk... ssssrrrk? \nWANDA No! Scene six; Scene five has been postponed. I'm not going to say it again; Mr. Palomino is not working today. Now where is that smoke machine! \nINT. SET BUILDING, HALLWAY. DAY \nThe AC bursts through a door at the end of the hallway and walks quickly toward the camera. Without knocking he pushes open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short. \nAC Oh. Sorry. \nStanding on his tiptoes at the sink, straining to turn off the running faucet is, TITO a DWARF. He is dressed in a sky blue tuxedo with tails. A top hat and white gloves rest on the closed toilet seat. Tito appears extremely annoyed. \nTITO What do you want?! \nAC I need to use the bathroom. Kind of an emergency. \nTITO Well, fucking knock!! \nTito grabs his hat and gloves and marches down the hall, the AC staring after him in astonishment. \nTITO (muttering) I swear to Christ, one of these days I'm going to punch somebody in the balls! \nINT. WARDROBE ROOM. DAY \nCamera is close on Nicole, her eyes clenched shut as a thin white veil is placed on her head. Camera pulls back to reveal SACHIKO, the Costume Designer putting the finishing touches to Nicole's costume, which appears to be an elaborate white wedding gown. Nick stands nearby, smoking. \nNICK Just as we pull up to your apartment Palomino suddenly says he feels so sick he can't work today. \nNICOLE God. Was it something he ate? \nSACHIKO Stand up, please. \nBOOM I think so. \nGAFFER You're right. It's coming back now. \nWOLF I'm going to let you handle this one, Bob. This is your baby. And Les, if he needs help you give him a hand. OK, guys? We're all working together today. \nWolf walks off. The Gaffer kneels to inspect the smoke machine closer. \nGAFFER Yup, all coming back now. Like riding a bike. T-160, 1985. 1985, T-160. \nAC Way to go, Bob. \nINT. THE SET. NEAR THE CAMERA \nWanda stands alone by the camera, looking around at the bustling crew like a battalion commander watching her troops in battle. Nick approaches her. \nNICK How are we doing, Wanda? \nWANDA Not good, Nick. Not bad, but not good. We need to finish this scene and do Scene thirty-one today. \nNICK Scene thirty-one?! I left my notes for Scene thirty-one at home! I didn't know we were -- \nWANDA Nick, Nick. I'll send someone to your apartment to pick them up. Now, relax. \nNICK Oh, OK. Send somebody to my apartment to pick them up; it's the red notebook, under the bed. \nWANDA It's taken care of, Nick. \nNICK Good. Great. Good. \nNick walks off quickly, muttering to himself. A moment later Wolf strolls up to Wanda. \nWOLF We're all lit, the smoke machine is under control; we're ready to go. \nWANDA (hard) What about the dolly? \nWOLF Just need to see a run-through and we're all set. I'm going to make your job easy today, Wanda. Wandaful. (he slips his arm around her) Mmm, I'm glad you wore that perfume. And don't worry about Palomino; I'll take you to a jazz club tonight. \nWANDA Oh, I can't make it. I have to go see Chad; he's extremely ill. \nWOLF Oh, by the way my eye's much better. \nWANDA Listen, Wolf, this may not be the best time to say this but our relationship is going nowhere. \nWOLF What do you mean? \nWANDA Please, don't take it personally. Because I care for you, Wolf, I really do. But I've had this feeling for quite a while and I think it's time we ended it. OK? \nWOLF (pause) OK. \nWANDA I think it's better. \nWOLF So do I. \nWANDA Well, good. Still friends? \nWOLF Sure. \nWANDA Great, cause we still have to work together and there's no reason it has to be unpleasant. Give me a hug. \nWanda and Wolf move into an extremely wooden embrace. \nWANDA You're a real special guy, Wolf. \nWOLF Thanks. \nWanda slips Wolf a tender smile then walks away. \nWANDA (into her walkie) OK, let's get the A Team in please! Nick, Ellen, Mr. Tito! \nNICK And, action. \nINT. THE DREAM. TAKE ONE. DAY \nNicole stands motionless in the middle of the empty set. Her white wedding gown stands out sharply against the deep red walls. A sad shred of smoke drifts by her head. \nNICOLE I am so hungry. \nTito opens the door and walks in, staring hard at Nicole. His sky-blue tuxedo gleams in the rich light. He walks around her in a circle holding the golden apple just beyond her reach. He stops on his mark and the camera dollies into a CU of him. He doesn't laugh. Nick watches this for a moment in intense concentration. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nNICK And... cut. \nWANDA That's a cut. Nick; comments? \nNICK Yeah, just a couple. I thought that was uh... good. Tito, that was very good, man, really. You didn't feel like laughing? \nTITO I laughed. \nNICK Oh, OK; I guess I missed it. You could make it bigger if you want. And Ellen, maybe just a little more tension when you see him. \nNICOLE I thought I didn't see him. \nNICK Right, maybe you see him a little bit. \nNICOLE Alright, I'm confused. Do I see him or not? \nNICK You see him. \nNICOLE OK, what is the tension? Who is Toto? \nTITO (hard) It's Tito. \nNICOLE (alarmed) What did I say? \nTITO Toto. \nNICOLE Oh, God. I'm sorry, Tito. I don't know why I'm doing that. I'm really sorry. \nNICK Ellen, come on now; concentrate. Remember; you're marrying Damian tomorrow. You're a little anxious. You have this dream. Let's call it an Anxiety Dream, and Tito represents the anxiety. \nCU Tito looking none too happy about this representation. \nNICK OK? It seems pretty simple. \nNICOLE Let's just try it. \nNICK Good. And Bob, let's really have some smoke on this one. \nGAFFER OK, more smoke. \nWOLF I still think it should be hand-held. \nNICK Yeah, well, I don't want it hand- held. I want it on the dolly. Where's my notebook, Wanda? \nWANDA On it's way, Nick. \nNICK Good. Call it, Wanda. \nWANDA Lock it up. Going for picture. And roll sound. \nSOUND Speed! \nWANDA Roll camera! \nAC Rolling! \nCLAPPER Scene six, take two! \nGAFFER We'll see some smoke now. \nAC Way to go, Bob. \nINT. A CORNER. DAY \nAs soon as Wolf and Nick reach the darkened corner, Wolf whirls to face Nick. \nWOLF I really don't like being spoken to like that, Nick! \nNICK Yeah, well I don't like your attitude! \nWOLF I don't have an attitude! \nNICK The hell you don't! Every time I ask you to do something all I get is No, No, No and I'm sick of it! I hired you to do a job; if you're not going to do it you better let me know right now! \nWolf is about to yell back at Nick when suddenly he stops and lets out a deep, painful sigh. \nWOLF I'm sorry, Nick. I'm going through some heavy shit. \nNICK What do you mean? \nWOLF I can't really go into it. It's pretty heavy. \nNICK Personal? \nWolf makes a slight motion with his head toward Wanda who is standing some distance away watching them. Seeing the two men looking at her Wanda shoots them a hard glare which prompts Wolf and Nick to turn away quickly. \nWOLF Personal, professional, emotional. It's doing a number on me. And now you're telling me you're going to fire me. \nNICK I didn't say that, Wolf. Come on, I'm not going to fire you. You're doing a great job here. \nWOLF Am I? \nNICK Yeah, I don't know what I'd do without you, man. You've got a great eye. I just hope it's not the one under that eyepatch. \nNick lets out a tense, strained laugh but Wolf's only response is to stare back at him sadly. \nNICK Listen, Wolf. Let me tell you one thing I've learned; sometimes you just have to roll with things. You know? \nWOLF You're right. \nNICK Roll with it, man. You'll be OK. \nWolf lets out another deep sigh. \nWOLF Thanks, bro. \nINT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY \nThe Gaffer, Boom man, and AC kneel around the smoke machine. A can of gas and a quart of oil stand beside them. \nBOOM That's where the oil goes. \nGAFFER No, that's where the gas goes. \nBOOM I'm tellin' you, Bob. That's where the oil goes. \nSOUND Lester, don't you think Bob knows where the oil goes?! \nGAFFER I don't remember using oil in '85. \nAC Maybe both the oil and gas go in there? \nThe Gaffer and Boom man turn and look at the AC for a long moment. \nBOOM I think he's right. \nGAFFER I think he is too. OK, three parts gas, one part oil. \nWANDA Cora Reve, R-E-V-E. Blue housecoat, blue slippers. How do I know? Because she's sitting ten feet away from me. Well sweetheart, that's going to be a real fucking problem. \nNicole turns away and walks past Jeff to the Craft Service table. \nJEFF She was waiting outside Nick's apartment when I went to pick up his notebook. She said she was looking for him so I figured I should just bring her up here. You look really pretty in that dress. \nNicole nods politely then looks to the Makeup corner where Nick sits talking earnestly to his mother. \nINT. MAKEUP CORNER \nNICK How did you get here? \nCORA I took a bus in; went right to your apartment. \nNICK How did you get out of your room? \nCORA Oh, I just went right through the door. \nNICK It was unlocked!? \nCORA No, it was locked. I just went through it. It's something I've learned to do, Nicky. I can walk through just about anything; like air. \nNICK Mom, you've got to stop doing this. I'm serious. I'm a little upset with you. You could have gotten lost, or hurt. \nCORA I wanted to see you. I've missed you. \nNICK I know, Mom; I've missed you too. But it's not really a good time. \nNicole approaches, holding up the hem of her wedding gown. There is a subtle tension smoldering between her and Nick. \nNICOLE They're sending a car. It should be here in a couple of hours. They didn't even know she was gone. \nNICK Jesus, I don't believe this. \nCORA I'm sorry, Nick. If I knew there was going to be a wedding I would have worn my fucking hat. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nThe camera holds on Tito pacing slowly, alone on the set. He is smoking fiercely, holding his top hat with one hand. Suddenly he begins laughing in a loud, stage bellow. \nINT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY \nNick sets a chair for his mother and helps her sit down. Nicole joins Tito on the set and talks quietly to him. \nNICK There. How's that, Mom? Can you see? \nCORA Is the little fellow going to do gymnastics? \nTito glances up at her quickly. \nNICK Shhhh! No. Now come on, Mom. You've got to be quiet. Absolutely quiet. OK? \nCORA (whispers) OK. \nINT. THE SET. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAY \nWanda and Wolf stand beside each other in tense, awkward silence for a long moment. \nWANDA How are you doing? \nWOLF Good; real good. \nWolf looks as if he's about to burst into tears as Nick walks up. \nNICK How's the smoke machine? \nWANDA It's dead, Nick. I've got calls out to every Effects house in the city but I just can't seem to locate -- \nNICK Forget it. We'll shoot without it. \nCORA Oh, I thought this was the TV room. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nNICK Cut! \nWANDA That's a cut. Going again, right away. \nINT. OFF THE SET. DAY \nNick escorts his mother back to her chair. \nNICK Mom, listen to me. I don't want you to move from this chair. Do you understand? \nCORA Oh Jesus, you sound just like your father... \nNICK Mom, I'm serious. \nCORA OK, OK. I won't move. \nNICK Thank you. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nNick walks back on the set and addresses Nicole and Tito. \nNICK OK, good. Very good. (laughs) Tito, I think we're having a little communication problem here. All I want you to do is laugh. OK? \nTITO Why? \nNICK I told you why. \nTITO Tell me again. \nINT. OFF THE SET. DAY \nWolf (still wearing his eyepatch) walks over and sits quietly in a chair beside Cora. He does not speak to her and gazes blankly out at Nick, Tito, and Nicole on the set some distance away. Cora however stares at the side of his head with such intensity Wolf can't help but turn to her. \nCora still doesn't take her eyes off him and in fact stares even more intently into his eye. \nWolf glances away for a moment then looks back. Cora continues to stare at him. Suddenly, his eye is full of tears. Cora watches in rapt silence. Wolf is crying openly now. Cora reveals no hint of emotion as she reaches out and gently lifts the eyepatch off of his eye. A tight smile of satisfaction creases her lips as a tiny pool of tears is released, streaming quickly down Wolf's cheek. No one sees this. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nNick paces tensely in front of Nicole and Tito. \nNICK Look, Tito. It's not that big a deal. It's a dream, alright. Strange things happen in a dream. All you have to do is laugh. Why is that such a problem? \nTITO Why does it have to be a dwarf? \nNICK What? \nTITO Why does my character have to be a dwarf? \nNICK He doesn't have to be a dwarf. \nTITO Then why is he?! Is that the only way you can make this a dream; put a dwarf in it? \nNICK No, Tito; that's not -- \nTITO Have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it?! Do you know anyone who's had a dream with a dwarf in it? NO! I don't even have dreams with dwarves in them! The only place I've seen dwarves in dreams is in stupid movies like this! Make it weird; put a dwarf in it. Everyone will go \"whoa whoa whoa, must be a dream, there's a fucking dwarf in it!\" Well, I'm sick of it. You can take this Dream Sequence and shove it up your ass! \nTito hurls his top hat and gloves to the floor and walks out. Everyone stares at Nick who is frozen in stunned silence. Finally Wanda approaches him hesitantly. \nWANDA Nick? (no response) I can get right on the phone. We'll try to get another... small person here as soon as possible. \nNICK No. He's absolutely right. \nNick sighs heavily and sinks to sit on the dolly in silence. Wolf appears behind him, still wiping his eyes. \nCORA (testily) Of course I knew you were filming. \nNICK You were great, you're a natural. And Nicole, that was beautiful. Don't you dare tell me that felt fake. \nSuddenly, on an impulse surprising both of them, Nick and Nicole embrace. Just then Wanda steps up. \nWANDA Going again, Nick? \nNICK Oh, hold on. Let me think a second. \nThe set grows suddenly quiet as Nick begins pacing rapidly, muttering to himself. \nNICK Can I use it for the Dream Sequence, that's the question. Does it work for the Dream Sequence? \nNick suddenly looks up and sees everybody staring at him; Nicole in her wedding gown, Wolf with his eyepatch, his mother still eating the apple, Wanda, the crew. \nNICK We're going with it, Wanda! \nWANDA Alright everyone, listen up. That is a wrap on Scene Six. \nThe set erupts in applause. \nSOUND Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! \nWANDA What?! \nSOUND I need to record room tone. I'll need thirty seconds of silence. \nWANDA Oh, alright! Quiet. Quiet! Shut up!! Thirty seconds of room tone. The sooner you're quiet the sooner we're done. \nCORA (whispers to Nick) What's room tone? \nNICK It's for the sound, Mom. We just have to be quiet. \nAt that moment a door opens at the rear of the set and a DOCTOR and NURSE enter. The Nurse carries an extra overcoat. Jeff, the Driver, turns and sternly whispers for them to be quiet. \nWANDA And roll sound. Nobody move. \nSOUND Speed. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nThe camera is wide, showing the entire set, actors, and crew. Everyone stands in perfect silence, as motionless as statues. As the silence continues the mood on the set gradually changes. One by one people drift into their own private worlds of reflection. \nMS the Sound man, alternately watching his recorder and his stopwatch. Behind him the Boom man holds the mike in position to record general ambiance while staring off into the distance. \nCU the tape recorder spinning in quiet precision. \nCU the stopwatch, its giant second hand showing five seconds have passed. \nMS Nick standing next to his mother who drapes one arm casually over Nick's shoulder. Nick glances up and sees Nicole beside him, absorbed in her own thoughts. Suddenly she looks up and her eyes meet Nick's. She slips him the barest hint of a smile. \nThe camera DOLLIES slowly through the standing, silent group, passing over faces in different degrees of thought. \nCU the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing ten seconds have passed. \nMS Nick. He is so immersed in thought he looks at no one. The camera slowly DOLLIES into a CU of him. \nINT. AN AWARDS CEREMONY \nCHAD PALOMINO stands at a gleaming podium, looking radiant in an immaculate tuxedo. He holds an envelope in his hands. \nCHAD We have a new category this year: Best Film Ever Made by a Human Being. And the winner is none other than my Best Bud, Nick Reve! \nAmid thunderous applause Nick bounds on the stage and accepts an Oscar from Chad. He stands grinning like an idiot as the applause continues. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nMS Nick, still wrapped in thought, his lips starting to form the same idiotic smile. MS Nicole. The camera DOLLIES slowly into her face, now tinged with a slight uneasiness. \n", "test1_input": "NICK I know that but I'd like to try it anyway. \nWOLF Handheld. \nNICK No, dolly. We go from Close-up to Wide-shot and back to Close-up in the same shot. \nWOLF I'll use the 35, minimize distortion; I'll light it all from the ceiling. It could be kind of great. \nWANDA Sounds incredible. How long, Wolf? \nWOLF I'll need to see a couple run- throughs. \nNICK Not too many. It's a tough scene for the actors. I want them to feel relaxed, fresh... \nWANDA We've got all day, Nick. Whatever it takes. What do you think, Wolf -- an hour, 45? \nWOLF I don't know how you drink that shit black, Nick. I got to dump in the milk. It's the only way I can cut the taste. \nSuddenly the Gaffer turns on the 5K, flooding the room with harsh, blinding light. \nNICK Jesus! \nWOLF What the fuck?! \nWANDA Flame on, asshole!! \nThe screen goes completely WHITE. \nINT. SET APT. DAY. B/W \nScreen is still white. Gradually it shifts back to proper exposure revealing NICOLE in Medium CU. Her eyes are riveting; it is obvious she is emotionally primed for the scene. A light meter is thrust in front of her face. She barely registers it. \nWS, the entire Living Room set. Nicole sits on a sofa facing Cora seated opposite in an overstuffed chair. Two flats have been joined at right angles to create the Living Room corner. A table lamp and assorted framed photographs complete the rather scrawny looking set. \nMost of the movie crew is seen, including Wolf looking through the camera. \nWANDA OK, picture's up. Quiet. Stop the work. Lock it up. Going for picture. \nNick approaches Nicole and Cora. \nNICK OK, nice and easy. Cora you're doing fine. Remember, really listen and really answer. (smiles at Nicole) I've got nothing to say to you. Just let it happen. It's all there. \nWANDA Ready, Nick? \nWOLF Look at this a second, Nick. \nNick moves behind the camera and looks through the eyepiece. Another CU of Nicole fills the frame. The image is visually and emotionally breathtaking. \nWOLF I pushed in a foot. She's incredible. It's coming right through the lens. \nNick grips Wolf's shoulder in gratitude. \nNICK That's great, man. Beautiful. \nWANDA Ready, Nick? \nNICK Let's go. Right away. \nWANDA And, roll sound. \nSOUND Speed! \nWANDA And, roll camera! \nAC Rolling! \nCLAPPER Scene six, take one. (hits the sticks) \nNICK Action. \n", "test1_true": "From the moment Nick calls \"action\" the film will cut directly to the shot the set camera is filming. The shot is fluid, graceful and in richly, beautiful COLOR. Nicole's performance is very strong; flawed only slightly by her nervousness. \nNICOLE Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny. \nCORA Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever. \nNICOLE You were just standing there looking at me. Then you pulled me up and said, \"You're not hurt.\" Like I was disgusting for faking, for doing the only thing I could think of to keep him from hitting me again. \nCORA I was worried about Danny. \nNICOLE You do remember. \nCORA He was smaller than you. \nNicole turns to Cora with the heartbreaking gaze of an abandoned child. Nick and the rest of the crew watch in awe. \nNICOLE You were so worried about Danny -- \nSuddenly the BOOM dips all the way into the shot. \nINT. SET APT. DAY. B/W \nWOLF Cut! Boom in.

He went over and started hitting Danny. \nCORA Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever. \nSuddenly a car stops right outside, a heavy, bass-driven rap song blasting out of its trunk-mounted speakers. \nINT.

Why doesn't the guy just get a flatbed trailer with about 600 speakers on it and tow it behind his car. \nEveryone nods in annoyed agreement; everyone except the Boom man who appears to be following the music with the mike, bopping to it through the headphones.

B/W \nNICK I'm sorry about all this, Nicole. \nNICOLE It's not your fault, Nick. Is there a way to use some of the earlier takes? \nNICK Not unless I change the shot; do a cutaway of Cora or something and intercut the takes. I don't want to do that. It's a really nice shot and what you're doing is incredible. \nNICOLE Thanks, Nick. \nNICK The radio mikes are going to make everything easier. So, look. Take a moment. Let all this shit go.

How does that sound? \nRight on his cue, Palomino walks to the bed. As the camera moves into the 2-shot he begins stroking Nicole's hair with extreme care and concentration. \nPALOMINO It sounds like the champagne talking. \nNICOLE I've loved you from the moment we met. \nPALOMINO Why didn't you tell me? \nNICOLE We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere -- God! \nUnder the onslaught of escalating hair-stroking, Nicole suddenly jerks her head away hard.

I don't know why I did that.

Everyone stand by. We're going again, right away. \nSOUND Excuse me, Ellen? You were a tad low on that take. \nNICOLE Oh, OK. I'll bring it up.

Palomino whirls on Nick and whispers fiercely. \nPALOMINO I'm out of here, man! \nNICK What's the matter?! \nPALOMINO I like you, but I made a big mistake taking this part. Have someone call me a cab. \nNICK Wait a second, Chad. Just talk to me. What's going on!? \nPALOMINO I can't act with this woman. I know she's a friend of yours but I got to tell you: she cannot act worth a shit! I'm giving her everything! The whole thing I just did with the hair; did you see that?

Nicole is just about to take off the headphones when she realizes she can hear Nick and Palomino talking quite clearly. Glancing up, she sees the Boom man has left his boom leaning against the wall, the mike pointing out the open set window. \nPALOMINO (V.O.) Why did you cast her? She sucked in that Richard Gere movie! \nNICK (V.O.) You're right. She is not the best actress in the world. I see that now but you've got to help me, Chad. I'm asking you to please help me here. We've got to get through this somehow. \nThe camera begins a slow DOLLY in to Nicole's astonished face. This will be intercut with a similar DOLLY in to the microphone leaning against the wall, ending in an ECU of the mike. \nINT. OFF THE SET. DAY \nCamera is close on Nick and Palomino. \nPALOMINO I'll tell you what this is about, man. You know why she took a cab this morning? \nNICK Something came up. \nPALOMINO No. She was in my hotel room and she didn't want you to know it. OK? I'm sorry it had to come out like this but I told her this morning \"thanks a lot, it was a lot of fun last night but let's get something straight -- it was just a one-time deal,\" and she didn't want to hear that. She wanted more, you see what I'm saying? It's rejection. \nINT. THE SET. DAY \nThe camera reveals Nicole now seated in her spot on the bed. She rises as Nick and Palomino reappear and approach her from behind the set. \nNICK Nicole, listen... \nNICOLE Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't working. I apologize. Chad, I apologize to you too. I'm completely unfocused here and I think you're absolutely right; what we need to do is loosen the scene up somehow. \nNick and Palomino stare at Nicole for a moment. \nNICK What would you like to do? \nNICOLE I was wondering if we could try improvising the scene. More along the lines of what Chad has been doing. Maybe that would help me find something. \nNick's smile of gratitude to Nicole looks almost drug-induced. \nNICK That's a fantastic idea. What do you think, Chad? \nPALOMINO Hey, that's the only way I can work. Let's take it apart, let's cut loose. \nNICK Good! And we'll shoot it! Hell, why not?! \nPALOMINO Roll that motherfucking camera, Wolfie! \nWOLF Kiss my ass! \nAlthough Wolf says this quite loud, Palomino doesn't hear him because he suddenly yells: \nPALOMINO Yeah! Let's go! \nNICK Alright, now we're making a fucking movie! Call it, Wanda! \nWANDA Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound. \nSOUND Speed! \nWANDA Roll camera! \nAC Rolling! \nCLAPPER Scene six, take five! \nNICK And, action. \nINT. THE SCENE. TAKE FIVE. THE IMPROV \n"}

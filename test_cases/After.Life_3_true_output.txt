ELIOT (O.C.) Mrs. Whitehall. Susan. I hope you found what you were looking for. 
ROOM Suddenly Eliot looks up sharply.   As if someone had spoken to him. 
ELIOT Think nothing of it Mr. Houseman.    No need to apologize. Eliot moves over to the wall. 
ELIOT I really enjoyed our time together. We pull back slowly. Eliot's talking to a POLAROID of an OLD MAN. We pull back further... the wall's covered in HUNDREDS OF POLAROIDS of BODIES in open coffins. Most of them have closed eyes but we glimpse some with their eyes wide open. Eerily staring at us. Eliot touches the Polaroid of a YOUNG MAN. We see the fear in the Young Man's eyes. 
ELIOT (O.C.) Anthony.    Anthony. Always confused. Just then we hear the doorbell ringing downstairs.    Eliot moves to the window. 
ELIOT'S POV A POLICE OFFICER stands at the front door.    A SQUAD CAR parked on the driveway. 
ELIOT'S ROOM Eliot steps back.    Calmly continues to dry his hands. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - DAY 
Eliot leads the Police Officer through the hallway. 
ELIOT How can I help you Officer? 
OFFICER I'd like to see the body. 
Eliot stops.   We see a brief flicker of unease in his eyes. 
OFFICER Frank Merano. I'm his brother.    Vincent Merano? I called this morning. 
ELIOT Mr. Merano.   Yes. Of course. 
VINCENT (OFFICER) I hope it's no trouble. I'd just like to see him before the funeral. Eliot glances at his watch.   Smiles at Vincent. 
ELIOT It's no trouble at all. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Eliot leads Vincent to Frank's covered body. Vincent looks over at Anna. The white sheet only comes to her shoulders, her head facing straight upwards. 
ELIOT Your brother's here. Vincent turns back to Eliot. We're not sure if Eliot was speaking to Frank or to Vincent. Eliot pulls the sheet away. Frank's face is flawless. No sign of any damage. 
VINCENT He looks so peaceful. You've done a beautiful job. Thank-you. 
ELIOT You should remember him as he used to be. Suddenly we hear a FAINT RUSTLING sound. Vincent glances again at Anna's body. Her head is now turned to one side. Wasn't she facing upwards a moment ago? Vincent's puzzled for a second then shrugs. Must have been his imagination. 
VINCENT That's the schoolteacher isn't it? Eliot pulls the sheet over Anna's face. 
ELIOT 
(QUICKLY) Yes. Very tragic. Now is there anything else I can help you with? Vincent frowns.   Turns back to Eliot. 
VINCENT Something's not right here. 
ELIOT (looks up sharply) Not right? Vincent nods towards Frank's body. 
VINCENT His smile.    It was a bit more... Vincent raises his fingers to his mouth, trying to find the right word. 
VINCENT ...smiley. 
ELIOT Smiley. 
ON FRANK'S MOUTH Eliot manipulates Frank's lips. 
VINCENT (O.C.) A touch more. 
PREP ROOM 
VINCENT That's much better. Thank-you.

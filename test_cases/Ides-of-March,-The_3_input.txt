GOV. MORRIS You okay? 
STEPHEN Yup...(Nope) Just trying to figure out our stops on the ground. 
GOV. MORRIS I think the weather might determine that. If we get there. 
Both men sit with their heads back on the headrests. STEPHEN We'll be fine...we have to do it...and it's the right thing. Nothing bad happens when it's the right thing. GOV. MORRIS Is this your personal theory...cause I can shoot holes in it...Roberto Clemente...on a humanitarian flight.

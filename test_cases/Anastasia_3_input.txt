EXT.	SEA CLIFF - NIGHT 
The wagon sits on the edge of a high cliff. Rasputin stands on the top of his wagon, staring at the sea demonically. The jagged bolts of lightening and the icy silver rain make him look all the more menacing. 
RASPUTIN (low, slow) She's out there ... 
The wind parts his beard and we see Bartok hanging upside down in it, trying to stay out of the storm. 
BARTOK I'm getting a chest cold.. 
RASPUTIN Bartok... a question. 
BARTOK I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead... 
RASPUTIN What do you think is the most humiliating way to die? 
Rasputin's eyes light up as if he just thought of the answer to his own question. Bartok is thrown out of his beard when he makes a sudden turn and leaps off the wagon. Bartok follows. 
BARTOK My cousin Mischa, nice fellow had some dental problems - you didn't want to watch him eat, let's put it that way... 
Rasputin steps in 
INT.	WAGON - NIGHT 
As Bartok continues, Rasputin moves to the reliquary's cabinet. 
BARTOK ... anyway, a bunch of other bats were hanging in the belfry - I know, cliche, but there you have it, and Mischa, not the brightest bat in the world, decides to hang in the bell. Which was fine for awhile until it started ringing ... (shivers) Ewwww, what a mess ... 
RASPUTTN (to reliquary) Show her to me ... 
BARTOK And it didn't help the tonal quality of the bell, either. 
IMAGES, horrifying and frightening, begin to spin into a small tornado. Rasputin throws open the door and the TORNADO bursts out streaking across the water. 
EXT.	SEA CLIFF - NIGHT 
Rasputin follows tornado to the cliff and watches as it disappears into the horizon of the water. Lightning and thunder crash as he laughs maniacally. 
INT.	CABIN - NIGHT 
which is swaying with the storm. PAN past Vladimir, snoring, his now limp mustache flopping wildly and past Dmitri, sleeping restlessly. Move to Anya, who seems quite content. 
From under the door SMOKY IMAGES silently slither. They float across the cabin and swirl around Anya. 
CLOSE ON: 
Anya's CLOSED EYES as the SMOKY IMAGES seem to enter her head. She smiles in her sleep and we are in ANYA'S DREAM. . . 
EXT.	FOREST - DAY 
Anya, in a beautiful white dress, is walking peacefully through a sunny part of a lovely forest on a spring day. She reaches down to pick some pretty flowers, then looks up as it seems to get dark... OMINOUS LOOKING CLOUDS cover the sun. Anya reaches down for another flower when she HEARS A GROWL.

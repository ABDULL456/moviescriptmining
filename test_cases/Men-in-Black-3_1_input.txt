ZED Detainees are on the tube to Toronto. No sign of Kay. Over. 
EX (V.0.) Copy that, good work, Zed. Zed crosses off... 
JAY Be nice to him. Trust me. Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup. 
JAY (CONT'D) Okay, you all wanted to go home. Well here we are. So how do you want to get off this rock? You guys have the spaceport on Long Island yet? Kay just looks at him. 
JAY (CONT'D) That place is a dump anyway. Best Margaritas in the Universe, my ass. What about the one in Ohio? The Archanans smile. 
ATTENDANT Here is the way home. The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and hands it to one of his attendants. The attendant bows, and RITUALLY PASSES IT... it passes through all the attendants and then to JAY. Jay gives it a look. 
JAY Here, huh? You're sure? 
LAMA The only future that ends with life begins there. 
JAY I'll take that as a strong "yes." Okay, then. Follow me. Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the terminal. Kay catches up -- 
KAY Where are we going? Jay looks at him a beat. 
JAY Omaha. And I'm gonna buy you the biggest T-bone you ever saw when we get there. So -- you head over to the Omaha tube and I'm gonna help these guys over here for a second. But I'll meet you in a minute. By the Omaha tube. They stare at each other -- 
KAY Sounds good. See you there. Kay turns to head off -- then, lightening fast, spins and reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card -- 
KAY (CONT'D) Omaha, my ass. Kay looks at the card: GREETINGS FROM SUNNY FLORIDA -- a tourist post card with palm trees, oranges and beaches. 
KAY (CONT'D) Let's go. 
JAY No, no, no. No way. Florida, Kay. 
KAY That's what it says. 
JAY Don't you get it? 
KAY Yeah, it's hot and muggy. The old people drive slow. 
(MORE) 
KAY (CONT'D) We'll stay somewhere air- conditioned and only drive after three when they're at dinner. 
JAY This is why you were there. In Florida. Because of them. You were helping them and that's why... that's why you get killed. Today, July 16. I saw the report myself. Agent Kay, dead at the scene. Killed by Yaz. 
KAY You know what an MiB agent calls it when he faces death? Besides I got you to watch my back, right? They walk to the FLORIDA TUBE 
JAY I just want you to know, I'm doing this out of love, man. 
KAY Doing what? He gets his answer -- Jay DECKS HIM. 
JAY You stay home and stay alive. But Kay isn't down. 
KAY I told them I'd help them -- I'm honor-bound to do it. Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jay's kidney. Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kay's solar plexus. Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard. 
JAY Damn, you used to have some abs. They continue to pound each other. As they trade punches:

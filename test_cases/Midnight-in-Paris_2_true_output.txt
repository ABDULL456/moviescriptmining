GIL It's not the present for me - I'm from 2010. ADRIANA What do you mean? GIL I dropped in on you just the way we dropped in on the 1890's. ADRIANA You did? GIL I wanted to escape my present just like you wanted to escape yours. To a golden age. ADRIANA Surely you don't think the twenties are a golden age? GIL To me they are. ADRIANA But I'm from the twenties and I'm tellin~ you the golden age is the Belle Epoque. GIL Yes but don't you see - to these guys the golden age was the Renaissance. They'd all trade the Belle Epoque to paint alongside Michelangelo or Titian. And those guys probably imagine life was better when Kubla Khan was around. I'm having an insight. A minor one but that accounts for the anxiety of my dream. ADRIANA What dream? GIL Last night I dreamed I ran out of zithromax - and then I went to the dentist and there was no novacaine - these people have no antibiotics - CONTD:   (6) 
ADRIANA What are you talking about? GIL And even in the twenties - no dishwashers - no 911 if your appendix bursts - no "movies on demand" 路 ADRIANA But if we love each other what does it matter when we live? GIL Because if you stay here and this becomes your present, sooner or later you'll imagine another time was really the golden time. And so will I - I'm beginning to see why it can't work, Adriana. The present has a hold on you because it's your present and while there's never any progress in the most important things, you get to appreciate - what little progress is made - the internet - Pepto- Bismol. The present is always going to seem unsatisfying because life itself is unsatisfying - that's why Gauguin goes back and forth between Paris and Tahiti, searching - it's my job as a writer to try and come up with reasons why despite life being tragic and unsatisfying, it's still worth it. ADRIANA That's the problem with writers - you're all so full of words - but I'm more emotional. I'm going to stay and live in Paris' most glorious time. You made a choice to leave Paris once and you regretted it. GIL Yes, that one I regretted but it was a real choice and I made the wrong one. This is a choice between accepting reality or surreal insanity. CONTD: (7) 
ADRIANA So finally you do love Inez more than me. GIL No - I love you - but this way lies madness - and if I'm ever going to write anything worthwhile I've got to get rid of my illusions and that I'd be happier in the past is one of them. ADRIANA Goodbye, Gil. GIL Goodbye Adriana.     Good luck. They kiss, she turns and goes to the table of artists. CUT TO: 
INT. GERTRUDE STEIN'S PLACE - NIGHT 
Gil being admitted to the Stein home.          He is full of energy. STEIN Ah - Pender - I read your rewrite. Yes 路路路 you're nicely on the right track. You've understood me clearly. If the rest of the book reads as well when you're done you'll have something of value. GIL (taking it back) Thank you. I can't tell you how much this means to me. STEIN Hemingway who read your chapters and agrees it's going to be a fine book did have one plot suggestion. GIL Hemingway read it?    What was his suggestion? CaNTO:

She embraces him, kisses him. He looks toward the house. 
LITTLE CHARLES You're breaking our rule. 
IVY They're on to me. Not us, just me. I told them I was seeing someone. I didn't tell them who. I just wanted you to know, in case it came up. (he stares at her) What? (beat) Charles... 
LITTLE CHARLES I adore you. 
64   INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON                                 64 
Barbara, Bill, Mattie Fae, Charlie, Karen, and Steve are already seated. The men have removed their suit coats. 
CHARLIE Pass the casserole, please? 
MATTIE FAE My casserole's coming. 
CHARLIE I'll eat some of yours, too -- 
BARBARA (calling out) Mom?! Let's eat! 
Little Charles and Ivy enter with the casserole. 
MATTIE FAE There he is. I wanted to put you at a kid's table but they wouldn't let me. 
LITTLE CHARLES Where do you want this? "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft      72. 64   CONTINUED:                                                      64 
Ad-lib greetings, hugs, handshakes, Karen's introduction of Steve. Ivy slips in and takes her seat. Little Charles goes to put Mattie Fae's casserole on the table, but drops it. 
It lands on the floor with a sickening SPLAT. 
LITTLE CHARLES (CONT'D)                       BILL Oh Jesus --!                        Whoops. 
MATTIE FAE                             STEVE Goddamn it --!                      O-pah! 
MATTIE FAE You goddamn clumsy goofball! 
LITTLE CHARLES                         CHARLIE Mom, I'm so sorry --                All right, nobody's hurt. 
Little Charles helps Johnna clean up the mess. 
MATTIE FAE (CONT'D) What about me? I'm hurt. 
CHARLIE                          LITTLE CHARLES You're not hurt.                    Mom, Jesus, I'm sorry -- 
IVY It's just an accident. 
MATTIE FAE That's my casserole! 
CHARLIE                              STEVE Let it go, Mattie Fae.              It's not a party until someone spills something. 
CHARLIE Jean, you didn't get any chicken. 
BARBARA                               JEAN No, she won't --                    I don't eat meat. 
CHARLIE                              STEVE You don't eat meat.                 Good for you. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) "Don't eat meat." Okay. Who wants chicken? Little Charles, chicken? 
MATTIE FAE Just put it on his plate for him or he's liable to burn the house down. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   73. 64   CONTINUED:                                                    64 
CHARLIE All right, Mattie Fae. 
BARBARA Mom...! 
Violet enters with a small framed photo of her and Bev. 
VIOLET Barb... will you put this? 
BARBARA Yeah, sure. 
Barbara takes it, places it on the sideboard. 
MATTIE FAE                           KAREN That's nice.                       That's sweet. 
VIOLET I see you gentlemen have stripped down to your shirt fronts. I thought we were having a funeral dinner, not a cockfight. 
An awkward beat. The men glumly put their suit coats back on. 
VIOLET (CONT'D) Someone should probably say grace. (no response) Barbara? 
BARBARA Uncle Charlie should say it. He's the patriarch around here now. 
CHARLIE I am?   Oh, I guess I am. 
VIOLET By default. 
CHARLIE Okay. (clears his throat) Dear Lord... 
All bow their heads. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) We ask that you watch over this family in this sad time, O Lord... (MORE) "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   74. 64   CONTINUED:                                                      64 CHARLIE (CONT'D) that you bless this good woman and keep her in your, in your... grace. 
A cell phone RINGS, playing the theme from Sanford and Son. Steve digs through his pockets, finds the phone, checks it.

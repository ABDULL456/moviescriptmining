{"test1_input": "JANE EYRE \nWritten by \nMoira Buffini \nAdapted from the novel by \nCharlotte Bronte \n2ND DRAFT 6TH MARCH 2008 \nEXT. A MIDSUMMER DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS. \nFirst light. Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked with dew. She carries a shawl and has a small bag of belongings over her shoulder. \nShe trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes, open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion. \nHer need to escape is so great that she crawls forward until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs. \nShe reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts herself on to it. She lands on the road. And runs. \nI/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH. \nThe sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an approaching coach. She flags it down. \nJane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks at her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod indicates she can get in. \nCUT TO: \nJane sinks into a dark corner. Her fellow passengers look shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early hour. She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl - although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to bear the day, she closes her eyes. \nEXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS. \nSunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door. With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out. \nShe looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is open moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets off at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It is not there. \nShe runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is receding towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, lost, alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her. \nShe leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into the gathering dark. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 2. \nEXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR. \nJane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She is trying to calm herself with a prayer. \nEXT. DAY. THE MOOR. \nJane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun. She is like someone numb with pain. She watches a lizard crawl over the rock. She is mesmerised. \nEXT. TWILIGHT. THE MOOR. \nJane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light fades. She hungrily licks the juice from her hand. \nEXT. DAWN. THE MOOR. \nJane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around her. A red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her side, watching her. It is Helen Burns. \nHelen reaches out. She touches Jane's hand. Jane wakes. She sits up. She is alone. \nEXT. DAY. BY A RIVER. \nJane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the stones. Jane makes no movement. \nA raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at the bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watches the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour. \nEXT. TWILIGHT. A FARM BY A WOOD. \nIt is raining hard. Jane sees a small girl come out of the farm with some leftovers. She drops them into a pigpen. \nCUT TO: \nJane leaning into the pigpen. She picks a stiffened mould of porridge out of the mud. She lets the rain wash it. She eats it ravenously. \nEXT. NEXT DAY. A WOOD. \nIt has stopped raining. Jane is huddled under a tree. She is shaking, shuddering. The life has gone out of her eyes. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 3. \nEXT. DAY. THE EDGE OF THE WOOD. \nThe moors rise away above her to the horizon. Jane looks up at the sun starting to set. The clouds are red and gold. \nShe sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her. The girl turns, looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows. \nEXT. EVENING. THE MOOR. \nDark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane is struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck. \nShe falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the point of despair. \nThe girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her. Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a light shining across the moor. Jane starts crawling. \n", "test1_true": "Jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the light. It has become a window. A brief flash of lightning shows her a low stone cottage. Helen Burns is sitting on the gate. \nCUT TO: \nJane is crawling through the narrow garden. On her knees, she peers through a window. \nOn either side of a bright little fire sit two young women. They look exactly like Jane; slight, neat, dressed in black. One, Diana, has her hair slightly curled and hides her gentle eyes behind spectacles. The other, Mary, is very young; no more than seventeen. Each has a book on her knee. They are talking intimately. \nThey look so close, so loving and the room looks so cosy that it pains Jane considerably. \nCUT TO: \nJane knocking at the door. Hannah, an old servant answers. She is suspicious; Jane looks like a wretch. \nHANNAH What do you want? \nJane manages to find her voice. \nJANE Shelter. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 4. \nHANNAH I can't take in vagrants. Here's a penny. Now take it and go. \nJANE I have no strength to go. \nHANNAH You can move off. And if there are others with you tell them we are not alone. We have a gentleman here, and dogs. \nJANE (DESPERATE) But I must die if I am turned away. \nThe door slams shut. Jane lets out a hopeless wail. \nJANE (CONT'D) God help me. I will die. \nShe turns away, her hope gone. As she collapses, she finds herself supported by a strong pair of black-clad arms. \nST JOHN All of God's creatures must die. But not prematurely - and not on my doorstep I hope. \nJane is lifted up. She finds herself looking into the face of the handsomest man she has ever seen; St John Rivers. He lifts her over the threshold into the warmth of Moor House. \nINT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - THE KITCHEN. \nA fire is roaring in the stove. Hannah is bent over it. \nHANNAH We've had a beggar woman come, Mr Rivers. I sent her - For shame! \nHannah falls silent as she sees Jane. \nST JOHN You did your duty in excluding her. Let me do mine in admitting her. \nHe sets Jane down before the hearth. She can barely stand. She is soaked to the bone, filthy with mud. Her skin has a ghastly pallor. Diana and Mary enter. \nDIANA St John, who is it? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 5. \nST JOHN I don't know; I found her at the door. \nHANNAH (GUILTILY) I thought her one of the gypsies from the cross. \nMARY She's as white as death. \nJane can hold herself up no longer. Diana moves forward. She and St John catch Jane and help her into a chair. The rain hammers on the windows. \nDIANA Hannah, some water. \nMARY She's worn to nothing. She looks like a spectre. St John, if you hadn't taken her in, we would have fallen upon her dead body in the morning. \nDIANA Mary. \nST JOHN She's no vagrant; I'm sure of it. \nHANNAH There's milk and bread for you. \nJane tries to mouth her thanks. She sips the milk. Eats a mouthful of bread. Diana kneels at her side. \nST JOHN Ask her her name. \nJANE I - I am J - \nJane cannot speak. She's incapable of uttering her own name. She hears John Reed's voice calling from far away. \nJOHN REED Jane Eyre! \nDIANA Please, tell us how we may help you. \nST JOHN Can we send for anyone? Who are your people? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 6. \nThe questions are deeply troubling to Jane. She is losing consciousness. \nShe sees an image of a small girl of ten, running away through a great darkening room. Jane tries to follow her. The action draws her up out of the kitchen chair. \nShe hears John Reed's voice again. \nJOHN REED (V.O.) Jane Eyre! Where are you? \n", "test1_id": 1332, "test2_input": "Jane, panicked, looking for somewhere to hide, passes out. \nINT. DAY. GATESHEAD - A GRAND RECEPTION ROOM. \nRain hammers against the windows. Jane aged ten, looking hunted, runs in looking for somewhere to hide. \nShe springs behind a curtain. John Reed enters; a fourteen year old, his stomach bursting out of his fancy clothes. He is holding a riding crop as if it is a sword. \nJOHN REED Come out, rat. I know you are in here. Come out now and I won't punish you. \nJane watches him pass by her. He practises a perfect lunge. \nJOHN REED (CONT'D) Rat. \nHe exits. Jane breathes a sigh of relief. She slowly pulls the curtain across, making the window a private sanctuary. There is a book lying on the seat. She opens it. \nCUT TO: \nJane is sitting cross-legged, completely absorbed in her book - a beautifully drawn picture of a cormorant. She runs her finger over it. We hear the sound of great waves plunging on to a shore. \nEXT. DAY. AN ARCTIC COAST. \nJane, aged ten, is sitting cross-legged on an isolated rock, her eyes locked with those of a stooping black cormorant. St John's voice comes from a long way away. \nST JOHN (V.O.) Diana, Mary help me get her upstairs... \nThe cormorant raises its wings like a great black cloak. Jane watches as it takes off and flies away. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 7. \nINT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE WINDOW SEAT. \nJane has her eyes closed. A great Atlantic wave hits the sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine. Suddenly the curtain is pulled back. John Reed stands in front of her. Jane shrinks back. \nJOHN REED I have been looking for you these last ten minutes. \nJANE What do you want? \nJOHN REED Say forgive me, Master Reed. \nJANE I have done nothing wrong. Master Reed. \nJohn grabs the book. \nJOHN REED Who gave you permission to read my book? \nJANE I wasn't aware it was yours. \nJOHN REED Everything in this house is mine. You're lucky to live here with gentleman's children like us. Your father had nothing. You should go and beg. \nJane stares him out. John can sense her contempt. He belts her with the book. Jane hits her head on the window clasp, drawing blood. She is shocked. \nJOHN REED (CONT'D) That's for the look you had on your face. You bad animal. \nJane snaps. She throws herself upon him, the rage in her released; pummelling, scratching, hurting him in any way she can. She is barely coherent. \nJANE Wicked and cruel - you are a slaver - a murderer - \nJOHN I shall tell mother - \nJANE I hate you John Reed. I hate you - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 8. \nJohn is flabbergasted. Like all bullies, he is terrified. \nJOHN Mamma! Mamma! There's a rat! Rat! \nJane bites him. Hard. At that moment, Mrs Reed appears on the scene. John screams. We see Mrs Reed's shocked face. She is an overweight woman pushing forty in a bright, elaborate dress. \nINT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - A BEDROOM \nDinah and Mary are gently taking Jane's soaking clothes off; one at each side of her. Jane is distressed, approaching a delirium. She resists them. \nINT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE RED ROOM. \nJane is carried in and set down on a footstool by two servants, Miss Abbot and Bessie - one at each side of her. She is still resisting. \nBESSIE For shame, hitting your master. \nMISS ABBOT If you don't sit still you must be tied down! \nThe fight goes out of Jane. She sits, defeated. Bessie, young and plump, quickly wipes her bleeding forehead. She has some compassion. Miss Abbot has none. \nBESSIE What we do is for your own good. If you are passionate and rude like this, your Aunt Reed will send you away. \nMISS ABBOT You're worse than us servants. We work for our keep; you do nothing. Pray for forgiveness Miss Eyre or something bad will come down that chimney and fetch you away. \nThe door slams. They are gone. Jane slowly grips the edge of the stool. The room is chill, silent. Red walls and curtains, murky in the fading light. \nIn front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth. Beside it, a full length looking-glass in which her pale reflection stares out. Behind her, a bed supported on pillars of mahogany, hung with red. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 9. \nThe piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white. Jane's breathing is the only sound in the room. \nA sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like fingernails. A distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of the black hearth. Jane reverts her nervous gaze to the pitted mirror. Her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face, her eyes glittering with fear. \n", "test2_true": "Slowly, a light appears over her. It may be something shining in from outside. But to Jane it seems as if it is surrounding her, enveloping her. The figure in the looking glass opens its mouth. The scream, held in so long, finally rips from Jane's throat. \nINT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE FIRESIDE. \nAt the sound of the scream, Mrs Reed, slumbering, almost jumps out of her skin. \nINT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE KITCHEN. \nMiss Abbott almost drops the tea tray she is carrying. \nINT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - A CORRIDOR. \nJane is banging on the door, screaming, hysterical with terror. Bessie rushes to the door and unlocks it. Jane flies into her arms. \nBESSIE Miss Eyre what is it? \nJANE Bessie! \nBESSIE Have you seen something? \nJANE There was a light. \nWe see Bessie's own fear as she glances into the dark room. Mrs Reed is storming towards them, furious. \nMRS REED Bessie, I gave orders that she was to be left in the red room until I came. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 10. \nBESSIE But she screamed so loud ma'am. \nMRS REED It is play-acting. Let her go. I know your tricks Jane Eyre and I abhor such artifice. Loose Bessie's hands, child. \nMrs Reed prises Jane away from Bessie as she speaks. \nMRS REED (CONT'D) You will now stay here an hour longer. \nJANE No - Aunt, have pity - \nMRS REED And only when you are perfectly submissive will I let you out. \nJANE Please - I cannot bear it - \nMRS REED Silence. This violence is repulsive. \nJANE I shall be killed - \nMRS REED Get back! \nJANE Have mercy, have mercy I beg you - \nMrs Reed throws her back into the room, slams the door and turns the key. We hear Jane's unspeakable howls of terror, her anguished bangs upon the door. \nBessie is looking at Mrs Reed aghast. Mrs Reed withers her with a frozen glare. \nINT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE RED ROOM. \nWe see Jane in her distress, hitting her head on the door. She falls back. On the floor, her arms and legs move beyond her control. She is having a fit. When it is over, we see Jane unconscious. She is lying in a pool of ghostly light. \nINT. DAY. MOOR HOUSE - A BEDROOM. \nThrough the light, Jane sees Mary and Diana Rivers at her side. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 11. \nMARY She's awake. \nSt John approaches in his parson's collar, blocking out the light as he looks down. Jane gazes at him remotely. \nST JOHN I'm sure we'll find she's simply had a misunderstanding with her people. I hope she's not done anything deplorable; there's nothing so sad as a fallen young woman. \nMARY Look at the suffering in her eyes. They're like dark pools - \nDiana smiles at Mary's tendency to over-dramatise. \nDIANA She has a peculiar face; I rather like it. \nST JOHN She's not at all handsome. \nDIANA She's so ill, St John. \nST JOHN Ill or well, she'll always be plain. \nJane's eyes slide away from him and close. \nINT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE MORNING ROOM. \nA bright morning. A huge clergyman dressed in black is staring down at Jane, blocking out the sun. We see him from her POV; his expansive chest, dramatic facial hair, huge flared nostrils, frowning brows. He is Brockelhurst, the epitome of grim. \nBROCKLEHURST There is no sight so sad and so deplorable as that of a wicked little girl. Do you know, Jane Eyre, where the wicked go after death? \nJANE They go to hell. \nBROCKLEHURST And what is hell, can you tell me that? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 12. \nJANE A pit full of fire. \n", "test2_id": 1333, "test3_input": "JANE Please, let us be reconciled. \nMrs Reed shrinks from Jane's touch. Jane wipes her tears. \nJANE (CONT'D) Then love me or hate me as you will. You have my full and free forgiveness. Now ask for God's - and be at peace. \nMrs Reed's eyes close. \nINT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE RED ROOM. \nThe morning sun is pouring in. Jane goes to the bed. She puts her hand upon it, gently, as if thanking her uncle for all he did. She notices a picture on the wall. A miniature of a brown-haired woman with elfin eyes. \nJane takes it off the wall. Bessie comes in. \nJANE My mother. \nBessie nods. A tear rolls down Jane's face. She clasps the picture, looking round the room. \nJANE (CONT'D) Why ever was I so afraid? \nEXT. DAY. A ROADSIDE. \nA coach pulls up in the lane near Thornfield. Jane gets out. We hear her voice. \nJANE (V.O.) My dear uncle, some years ago, my Aunt Reed mistakenly informed you that I had died. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 79. \nEXT. EVENING. A SUMMER WOOD. \nJane is walking through the wooded glade where she first met Rochester. All is green and verdant and bathed in sunset light. There seems to be life everywhere. \nJANE (V.O.) I am writing to tell you that I am very much alive and living at Thornfield Hall, where I am currently governess to the ward of Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester - \nROCHESTER (O.S.) There you are. \nJane turns. Rochester is sitting on the stile where they first met. For a moment, her every nerve is unstrung. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Just like one of your tricks to steal into your home along with the twilight. Where the deuce have you been this last month? \nJANE I have been with my aunt sir, who is dead. \nRochester laughs. \nROCHESTER A true Janian reply. If I dared I'd touch you, to see if you were real... \nJane puts out her hand. Rochester takes it. He helps Jane over the stile. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Go home - stay your wandering feet at a friend's threshold. \nJane lets go of his hand. \nJANE Thank you Mr Rochester. I'm strangely glad to get back again to you. Wherever you are is my home. \nJane, knowing she has said too much, turns and runs over the fields towards Thornfield. \nINT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR \nJane is on a low seat, Adele nestling close to her. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 80. \nMRS FAIRFAX We're expecting the announcement very soon. He went down to London only last week to buy her a new carriage. \nJANE Then we must accept it. He'll soon bring home his bride. \nMrs Fairfax nods. \nEXT. TWILIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE ORCHARD \nJane is alone, drinking in the beauty of the evening - looking at the gardens as if she may never see them again. She turns a corner and sees Rochester staring intently at something. His back is to her. She is about to tiptoe away. \nROCHESTER Come and look at this fellow, Jane. \nJane approaches, wondering how he has sensed her presence. Rochester is looking at a huge moth. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Look at his wings. He looks West Indian - I have never seen one like him, here. There; flown. \nThey watch the moth as it flies towards the house. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, isn't it? \nJANE I'll be sad to leave it. \nROCHESTER Yes, but it can't be helped. I soon hope to be a bridegroom. \nJANE Have you found me a new situation, sir? \nROCHESTER A situation, yes of course. It's the least I can do for a faithful paid subordinate such as yourself. You're to undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs Dionysus O'Gall of Bitternut Lodge, Connaught. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 81. \nJANE Connaught? \nROCHESTER You'll like Ireland. They're such warm-hearted people, they say. \nJANE It is a long way away, sir. \n", "test3_true": "JANE From here. From you. \nROCHESTER We've been good friends, Jane haven't we? But with the Irish sea between us you'd soon forget me. \nJane's great distress escapes her. \nJANE I wish I could. I wish I'd never come here. I love Thornfield - I've lived a full life here. I've not been trampled on or petrified or buried with inferior minds. I've talked face to face with what I reverence, with what I delight in. I've known you Mr Rochester - \nROCHESTER Then why must you be torn from me? \nJANE Because of your bride. \nROCHESTER I have no bride. \nJANE But you will have. \nROCHESTER Yes, I will. \nJANE Then I must go. \nROCHESTER You must stay. \nJANE Do you think I could stay to become nothing to you? Am I an automaton, a machine without feelings? (MORE) Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 82. \nJANE (CONT'D) Do you think that because I am poor, obscure, plain and little that I am soulless and heartless? \nROCHESTER JANE - \nJANE I have as much soul as you and full as much heart. I'm not speaking to you through mortal flesh. It's my spirit that addresses your spirit as if we'd passed through the grave and stood at God's feet, equal - as we are. \nRochester takes Jane in his arms. \nROCHESTER As we are. \nJane struggles away from him. \nJANE Let me go. \nROCHESTER NO - \nJANE I'm a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you. \nRochester releases her. She stands in front of him. \nROCHESTER Then let your will decide your destiny. I offer you my hand, my heart and a share of all this. \nHe gestures towards the house, the land. Jane is stunned. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) I ask you to pass through life at my side. Jane, you are my equal and my likeness. It is you I intend to marry. \nJANE Are you mocking me? \nROCHESTER Do you doubt me? \nJANE Entirely. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 83. \nROCHESTER You have no faith in me? \nJANE Not a whit. \nROCHESTER You little sceptic. \nJANE Your bride is Miss Ingram - \nROCHESTER What love have I for Miss Ingram? What love has she for me? I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was lost and got instant coldness. I wanted to make you jealous, to move you to love me. It's you - you strange, unearthly thing. I love you as my own flesh. You - poor and obscure as you are - please accept me as your husband. \nJane begins to believe him. \nJANE Are you in earnest? \nROCHESTER I must have you for my own. \nJANE You wish me to be your wife? \nROCHESTER I swear it. \nJANE You love me. \nROCHESTER I do. \nJANE Then sir, I will marry you. \nThey embrace. \nNeither Jane nor Rochester moves. Darkness is almost complete. Still the intensity of the embrace is held. \nROCHESTER It will atone. It will atone. \nA sheet of lightning momentarily lights up the sky. Some moments later a distant rumble of thunder. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 84. \nI/E. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE FRONT HALL \n", "test3_id": 1334}

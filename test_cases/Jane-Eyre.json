{"train": "JANE EYRE \nWritten by \nMoira Buffini \nAdapted from the novel by \nCharlotte Bronte \n2ND DRAFT 6TH MARCH 2008 \nEXT. A MIDSUMMER DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS. \nFirst light. Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked with dew. She carries a shawl and has a small bag of belongings over her shoulder. \nShe trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes, open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion. \nHer need to escape is so great that she crawls forward until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs. \nShe reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts herself on to it. She lands on the road. And runs. \nI/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH. \nThe sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an approaching coach. She flags it down. \nJane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks at her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod indicates she can get in. \nCUT TO: \nJane sinks into a dark corner. Her fellow passengers look shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early hour. She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl - although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to bear the day, she closes her eyes. \nEXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS. \nSunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door. With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out. \nShe looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is open moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets off at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It is not there. \nShe runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is receding towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, lost, alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her. \nShe leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into the gathering dark. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 2. \nEXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR. \nJane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She is trying to calm herself with a prayer. \nEXT. DAY. THE MOOR. \nJane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun. She is like someone numb with pain. She watches a lizard crawl over the rock. She is mesmerised. \nEXT. TWILIGHT. THE MOOR. \nJane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light fades. She hungrily licks the juice from her hand. \nEXT. DAWN. THE MOOR. \nJane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around her. A red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her side, watching her. It is Helen Burns. \nHelen reaches out. She touches Jane's hand. Jane wakes. She sits up. She is alone. \nEXT. DAY. BY A RIVER. \nJane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the stones. Jane makes no movement. \nA raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at the bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watches the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour. \nEXT. TWILIGHT. A FARM BY A WOOD. \nIt is raining hard. Jane sees a small girl come out of the farm with some leftovers. She drops them into a pigpen. \nCUT TO: \nJane leaning into the pigpen. She picks a stiffened mould of porridge out of the mud. She lets the rain wash it. She eats it ravenously. \nEXT. NEXT DAY. A WOOD. \nIt has stopped raining. Jane is huddled under a tree. She is shaking, shuddering. The life has gone out of her eyes. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 3. \nEXT. DAY. THE EDGE OF THE WOOD. \nThe moors rise away above her to the horizon. Jane looks up at the sun starting to set. The clouds are red and gold. \nShe sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her. The girl turns, looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows. \nEXT. EVENING. THE MOOR. \nDark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane is struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck. \nShe falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the point of despair. \nThe girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her. Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a light shining across the moor. Jane starts crawling. \nJane, panicked, looking for somewhere to hide, passes out. \nINT. DAY. GATESHEAD - A GRAND RECEPTION ROOM. \nRain hammers against the windows. Jane aged ten, looking hunted, runs in looking for somewhere to hide. \nShe springs behind a curtain. John Reed enters; a fourteen year old, his stomach bursting out of his fancy clothes. He is holding a riding crop as if it is a sword. \nJOHN REED Come out, rat. I know you are in here. Come out now and I won't punish you. \nJane watches him pass by her. He practises a perfect lunge. \nJOHN REED (CONT'D) Rat. \nHe exits. Jane breathes a sigh of relief. She slowly pulls the curtain across, making the window a private sanctuary. There is a book lying on the seat. She opens it. \nCUT TO: \nJane is sitting cross-legged, completely absorbed in her book - a beautifully drawn picture of a cormorant. She runs her finger over it. We hear the sound of great waves plunging on to a shore. \nEXT. DAY. AN ARCTIC COAST. \nJane, aged ten, is sitting cross-legged on an isolated rock, her eyes locked with those of a stooping black cormorant. St John's voice comes from a long way away. \nST JOHN (V.O.) Diana, Mary help me get her upstairs... \nThe cormorant raises its wings like a great black cloak. Jane watches as it takes off and flies away. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 7. \nINT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE WINDOW SEAT. \nJane has her eyes closed. A great Atlantic wave hits the sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine. Suddenly the curtain is pulled back. John Reed stands in front of her. Jane shrinks back. \nJOHN REED I have been looking for you these last ten minutes. \nJANE What do you want? \nJOHN REED Say forgive me, Master Reed. \nJANE I have done nothing wrong. Master Reed. \nJohn grabs the book. \nJOHN REED Who gave you permission to read my book? \nJANE I wasn't aware it was yours. \nJOHN REED Everything in this house is mine. You're lucky to live here with gentleman's children like us. Your father had nothing. You should go and beg. \nJane stares him out. John can sense her contempt. He belts her with the book. Jane hits her head on the window clasp, drawing blood. She is shocked. \nJOHN REED (CONT'D) That's for the look you had on your face. You bad animal. \nJane snaps. She throws herself upon him, the rage in her released; pummelling, scratching, hurting him in any way she can. She is barely coherent. \nJANE Wicked and cruel - you are a slaver - a murderer - \nJOHN I shall tell mother - \nJANE I hate you John Reed. I hate you - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 8. \nJohn is flabbergasted. Like all bullies, he is terrified. \nJOHN Mamma! Mamma! There's a rat! Rat! \nJane bites him. Hard. At that moment, Mrs Reed appears on the scene. John screams. We see Mrs Reed's shocked face. She is an overweight woman pushing forty in a bright, elaborate dress. \nINT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - A BEDROOM \nDinah and Mary are gently taking Jane's soaking clothes off; one at each side of her. Jane is distressed, approaching a delirium. She resists them. \nINT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE RED ROOM. \nJane is carried in and set down on a footstool by two servants, Miss Abbot and Bessie - one at each side of her. She is still resisting. \nBESSIE For shame, hitting your master. \nMISS ABBOT If you don't sit still you must be tied down! \nThe fight goes out of Jane. She sits, defeated. Bessie, young and plump, quickly wipes her bleeding forehead. She has some compassion. Miss Abbot has none. \nBESSIE What we do is for your own good. If you are passionate and rude like this, your Aunt Reed will send you away. \nMISS ABBOT You're worse than us servants. We work for our keep; you do nothing. Pray for forgiveness Miss Eyre or something bad will come down that chimney and fetch you away. \nThe door slams. They are gone. Jane slowly grips the edge of the stool. The room is chill, silent. Red walls and curtains, murky in the fading light. \nIn front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth. Beside it, a full length looking-glass in which her pale reflection stares out. Behind her, a bed supported on pillars of mahogany, hung with red. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 9. \nThe piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white. Jane's breathing is the only sound in the room. \nA sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like fingernails. A distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of the black hearth. Jane reverts her nervous gaze to the pitted mirror. Her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face, her eyes glittering with fear. \nBROCKLEHURST And should you like to fall into that pit and be burning there forever? \nJANE No sir. \nBROCKLEHURST What must you do to avoid it? \nJANE I must keep in good health and not die. \nMrs Reed is by the fireside in an ultra-feminine dress. She puts down her tea cup in irritation. \nMRS REED I've been her sole benefactress and her kindest friend. But she shows no gratitude and brings nothing but discord into my house. \nBROCKLEHURST What is her parentage? \nMRS REED She's an orphan. Her mother was my late husband's sister. On his deathbed he exhorted me to care for her. I have always treated her as one of my own. \nJane silently revolts against this lie. \nMRS REED (CONT'D) If you accept her at Lowood school Mr Brocklehurst, keep a strict eye on her. Her worst fault is a tendency to deceit. I'm sorry to tell you that Jane Eyre is a liar. \nJane's eyes flash with outrage. \nBROCKLEHURST All liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone. She shall be watched, Mrs Reed. \nMRS REED I wish her to be made useful, to be kept humble. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 13. \nBROCKLEHURST You can rest assured dear lady that we mortify our girls in the sentiments of vanity and pride. They are taught to be quiet, plain and modest. \nA passion of resentment is forming in Jane. \nBROCKLEHURST (CONT'D) We shall root out the wickedness in this small, ungrateful plant. \nMrs Reed smiles sweetly. \nMRS REED And as for its vacations, it must spend them all at Lowood. \nINT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE ENTRANCE HALL. \nJane is climbing the staircase. John Reed blocks her way. \nJOHN So, Rat, you're being sent away. It's as I thought; you're not fit to associate with me. \nJane snaps. She cries out: \nJANE You are not fit to associate with me! \nINT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE MORNING ROOM. \nMrs Reed is at her desk. Jane appears in front of her. \nJANE You said I was a liar. Well I am not. If I was, I should say that I loved you and I don't. I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed. He is a liar, not I. \nMRS REED How dare you speak in this manner. \nJANE I'll never call you Aunt again as long as I live and if anyone asks how I liked you I'll say that the very thought of you makes me sick. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 14. \nMRS REED You wouldn't dare. \nJANE I'll remember how you thrust me back into the Red Room and locked me there to my dying day. Even when you knew it was haunted and I begged to be let out. People think you are good but you are bad and hard-hearted and I'll let everyone at Lowood know what you have done! \nMRS REED Children must be corrected for their faults. \nJANE Deceit is not my fault! \nMRS REED But you are passionate. \nJANE My Uncle Reed is in heaven and can see all that you do and think; so can my mother and father. They know how you hate me and wish me dead. They can see. They see everything you do and they will judge you, Mrs Reed. \nMrs Reed has turned quite pale. Jane blazes with victory. \nEXT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE GATE HOUSE. \nBessie is waiting with Jane while her belongings are loaded onto a public coach, its top laden with passengers. \nBESSIE You're such a queer, solitary little thing. If only you could make yourself more appealing. Perhaps if you tried smiling from time to time, people would find you more pleasant - \nJANE Don't scold me Bessie. I know you dislike me - \nBESSIE I don't dislike you Miss; I'm fonder of you than of anyone. \nJANE You don't show it. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 15. \nBESSIE Miss Jane - \nJane throws her arms around Bessie and embraces her with great force. Bessie returns the embrace, surprised, moved. Jane gets into the coach. Bessie looks up at the driver. \nBESSIE (CONT'D) You take good care of her. \nJane's small, pale face peers out of the coach window, watching Gateshead recede. She doesn't cry. But Bessie can't stave off her tears. \nINT. NIGHT. LOWOOD - THE HALL. \nJANE Can he not do God's work here? \nMARY This quiet parish will never do for him; he almost raves in his restlessness. It breaks our hearts. \nDIANA St John burns with talents and ambition. But he lacks the means for advancement here. Our poverty thwarts him at every turn and so he has chosen to lay all his gifts on God's altar. \nMARY We've tried to persuade him to stay but in some things our brother is - he is - \nDIANA Inexorable as death. \nMARY We are now without father. We'll soon be without home and brother. \nJane feels a powerful compassion for them. \nJANE In one thing you are fortunate. \nShe looks over at the horizon. \nJANE (CONT'D) You have each other. \nEXT. DAY. LOWOOD - THE GROUNDS. SPRING. \nJane is looking at the high wall which is the horizon of her world at Lowood. Her eyes come to rest on the main door. Two men are carrying a small coffin out of the school. Brocklehurst follows it with a menthol-soaked cloth over his mouth and nose. He becomes aware of Jane's eyes on him. He looks away. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 25. \nINT. NIGHT. LOWOOD - THE DORMITORY. \nJane is creeping down a corridor in her night dress. She peers in through the dormitory door. It has been turned into a sanitarium. Camphor and vinegar are being burnt. Jane can hardly look at the sick girls. \nMiss Temple, pale with exhaustion, is speaking intimately to Madame Pierrot, the French mistress. Jane overhears. \nMISS TEMPLE This is the result of semi- starvation and neglected colds; Brockelhurst's idea of mortifying their bodies to save their souls. TYPHUS - \nMiss Temple can't say more. \nMADAME PIERROT Write to the governors. You must. \nJane creeps on. \nINT. NIGHT. LOWOOD - MISS TEMPLE'S ROOM. \nJane opens the door. A small bed has been set up at the foot of Miss Temple's. In it lies Helen Burns. A candle is set on a table at her side. Jane takes her hand. \nJANE Helen. \nHELEN Is it you, Jane? Have you come to say goodbye? \nJANE You're cold. \nHELEN I'm very happy. I am going home. \nJANE Back to your father? \nHELEN My father has a new wife. He'll not miss me much. \nJANE Then where? \nHELEN To my future home, where all is light. I am going to God. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 26. \nJANE No... \nJane is devastated. She climbs into bed next to Helen. For a moment, they hold each other. Jane's tears silently fall. \nHELEN Don't be sad. I will escape great suffering by dying young. \nJANE No... \nHELEN I don't have any talent to make my way in life. I should be always at fault. But God is my friend. He loves me. \nJANE Then he must save you. \nHELEN He is saving me. \nJane cannot articulate her distress at Helen's words. \nHELEN (CONT'D) I feel like I could sleep now. I like to have you near - \nJANE I won't leave you. \nHELEN You're so warm and alive. Jane, you have a passion for living. \nINT. DAY. LOWOOD - MISS TEMPLE'S ROOM. \nWe see Miss Temple looking down at the bed in the dazzling, morning light. Jane, waking, has her small arms around Helen, as if fiercely protecting her. Helen is ashen, her eyes open, staring at some unseen thing. She is dead. Miss Temple lifts Jane away. \nMISS TEMPLE Jane... \nJane realises what has happened. We hear the sound of her distress begin. She is inconsolable. \nJANE No, no, no - \nMARY (V.O.) Jane? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 27. \nJane is in her scullery putting all her energy into scrubbing dishes. \nMRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) Jane Eyre is requested to send references and all particulars to Mrs Fairfax at Thornfield Hall. \nJane closes her eyes, trying to banish her thoughts. It is no good. The memories crowd in. \nINT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE GROUND FLOOR. \nA smiling lady dressed in black approaches her through the darkness - Mrs Alice Fairfax. \nMRS FAIRFAX How do you do, my dear? What a long and tedious journey you must have had of it. John is quite the slowest driver in the county. You must be cold to the bone. \nJANE Are you Mrs Fairfax? \nMRS FAIRFAX Indeed I am; come and warm yourself in here. \nMrs Fairfax leads Jane up the dark corridor and into a cosy parlour. Leah, a young maidservant, follows. \nMRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D) Your poor hands must be quite numb; here, let me help you. \nMrs Fairfax undoes the ribbon on Jane's bonnet. Jane is taken aback, unused to motherliness of any kind. \nMRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D) Leah, make a little hot port and cut a sandwich or two. \nLeah eyes Jane with great curiosity. She hurries away. \nMRS FAIRFAX Draw nearer the fire. John is taking your trunk up to your room. \nKnitting apparatus lies abandoned on a fireside chair. Mrs Fairfax moves it and gestures for Jane to sit. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 31. \nMRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D) I've put you at the back of the house; I hope you don't mind. The rooms at the front have much finer furniture but they are so gloomy and solitary I think. \nJane can't help noticing that every surface is covered in lace, embroidery, or fine crochet. The whole room is an advertisement for Mrs Fairfax's skill at handicrafts - and testament to the hours she has spent alone. \nMRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D) I'm so glad you are come. To be sure this is a fine old house but I must confess that in winter one can feel a little dreary and alone. Leah is a very nice girl and John and Martha good people too, but they are servants - and one cannot talk to them on terms of equality. \nJANE Am I to have the pleasure of meeting Miss Fairfax tonight? \nMRS FAIRFAX Who? \nJANE Miss Fairfax - my pupil? \nMRS FAIRFAX Oh you mean Miss Varens; Mr Rochester's ward. She is to be your pupil. \nJANE Who is Mr Rochester? \nMRS FAIRFAX Why, the owner of Thornfield. \nJANE I thought Thornfield Hall belonged to you. \nMRS FAIRFAX (bursting into laughter) Oh bless you child, what an idea. To me? I am only the housekeeper. \nJANE Forgive me - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 32. \nMRS FAIRFAX There is a distant connection between Mr Rochester and I - his mother was a Fairfax - but I'd never presume on it. Heavens, me, owner of Thornfield? \nShe continues to laugh. A bashful smile is playing on Jane's lips. Mrs Fairfax is beginning to thaw her. \nINT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE HALL / STAIRCASE. \nMrs Fairfax is carrying a lamp across the great hall; the only light. Jane can perceive grandeur looming out of the darkness; Jacobean fireplace, coat of arms, head of a stag. Very gloomy, eerie. Her breath is vaporising in the cold. \nMRS FAIRFAX We shall have a cheerful house this winter... \nAs Jane follows Mrs Fairfax up the stairs, light is thrown on portraits of dour, craggy, long dead ancestors. \nMRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D) With Miss Varens here - and with you - we'll have quite a merry time of it. \nINT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - A LONG GALLERY. \nDark heavy drapes, another striking portrait. A dark, voluptuous woman in an 18th Century gown, ruby lipped, one full breast exposed. Jane glances away, taken aback by the woman's bold expression and her nakedness. \nMRS FAIRFAX I'm sure that last winter - and what a severe one - if it didn't rain it snowed and if it didn't snow it blew a gale - last winter I declare that not a soul came to the house from November to February. \nMrs Fairfax leads Jane through the wood-panelled darkness. \nMRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D) I got quite melancholy night after night alone. When spring finally came I thought it a great relief that I hadn't gone distracted. \nShe opens the door to a small but delightful room. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 33. \nMRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D) Here. \nJane looks in: a fire burning, a lamp lit by her bed, a soft quilt, pale chintz curtains. \nJANE OH - \nShe is utterly speechless. Her eight years of physical discomfort and hardship are over. \nMRS FAIRFAX Good night, my dear. I hope you'll be comfy. \nJANE Thank you. \nMRS FAIRFAX What is it, child? You've been here three months now and I'm worried that the position is not enough / to occupy your - \nJANE Oh, Mrs Fairfax, no. I'm so thankful to be at Thornfield. Please don't think I'm so ungrateful as to be discontented. \nMRS FAIRFAX But it's a quiet life, isn't it? This isolated house; a still doom for a young woman... \nJane looks out at the view once more. \nJANE I wish a woman could have action in her life, like a man. It agitates me to pain that the sky- line over there is ever our limit. I long sometimes for a power of vision that would overpass it. If I could behold all I imagine... I've never seen a city, never spoken with men. I've never even seen a town of any size. And I fear my whole life will pass, without ever having... \nMrs Fairfax's troubled look makes Jane fall silent. Mrs Fairfax looks as if she is about to say something - then puts on her practical face, the moment of intimacy gone. \nMRS FAIRFAX Well now - exercise is a great cure for anything, they say. (MORE) Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 37. \nMRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D) I have some letters to post; will you take them? \nEXT. DAY. A FROZEN MEADOW. \nJane is walking with purpose, carrying a bundle of letters. The exercise is lifting her spirits. The sun is sinking, turning the frost gold. \nEXT. DAY. A FROZEN WOOD. \nA brook runs close to the path; half frozen. Its slow trickle is the only sound to be heard. Jane moves slowly, acutely aware of everything around her. \nFurther into the wood, the brook has frozen right across the path. Jane slips on it as she passes. The noise of her feet echoes. She steadies herself. \nShe gazes at a huddle of snowdrops, their heads bowed. A crystal drop of water runs to the end of a snowdrop and begins to freeze as she watches. It is held suspended as if the whole winter is contained in it. \nThe moon is mounting the sky. Jane hears a sound like the beating of wings. The blood is rushing through her ears. \nHer trance is broken by the figure of a great dog - which glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her feet. The beating is loud; not wings she realises, but the rush of an approaching horse. It is almost on top of her before she can move. Her shocked, pale face, her black garments startle both horse and rider. \nROCHESTER What the deuce - \nThe rider gets the horse under control and continues, only to have his horse slip on the ice. Both man and horse fall with a crash. The dog begins to bark, until the hills echo with the sound. The horse is on one side; the man is lying, trapped beneath it on the ice; Edward Fairfax Rochester. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Hellfire. \nJane is confounded. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Pilot, get down! GET DOWN I SAY! \nJANE Can I do anything, sir? \nRochester stares at her; a tiny black figure, surrounded by darkening frost, the low moon behind her. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 38. \nROCHESTER Get back. \nJane doesn't move. Rochester turns to his horse. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Mesrour. Mesrour. \nWith much stamping and clattering, the horse clambers to its feet. Rochester seems relieved. \nHe tries to stand himself. His ankle will bear no weight. He lets out an involuntary cry. It echoes: \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Damnation. \nJANE Are you injured, sir? \nRochester looks at her once more. He manages to get himself off the ice. He sits on a nearby stile. Jane approaches him. She now has the moon on her face. She begins to look less like a phantom and more like a girl. \nJANE (CONT'D) If you are hurt and want help I can fetch someone from the village. I'm on my way there to post a letter. \nRochester looks as if he doesn't believe her. \nROCHESTER Where do you come from? \nJANE Thornfield Hall. \nROCHESTER Whose house is that? \nJANE Mr Rochester's. \nROCHESTER Do you know Mr Rochester? \nJANE No, I've never seen him. \nRochester is trying to place her. She is a puzzle to him. \nROCHESTER You're not a servant there... \nJANE I am the governess, sir. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 39. \nROCHESTER The governess. (A slow smile) Deuce take me, I had forgotten. \nExamining Jane once more, he laughs a low laugh. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) The governess. \nJane does not like to be laughed at. \nJANE Because I was burdensome and she disliked me. \nROCHESTER Lowood; that's a charity school, isn't it? \nJANE Yes. \nROCHESTER How long did you survive there? \nJANE Eight years. \nROCHESTER No tale of woe... \nMRS FAIRFAX I daily thank providence for sending us Miss Eyre. She's a kind and patient teacher and an invaluable / companion - \nROCHESTER Don't trouble yourself to give her a character. I'll judge for myself. She began by felling my horse. \nMRS FAIRFAX Sir? \nROCHESTER I have her to thank for this sprain. \nMrs Fairfax looks at Jane, bewildered. Rochester lifts one of her watercolours. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Adele has brought me these; are they yours? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 43. \nJANE Yes sir. \nA swollen sea. A cormorant, a golden bracelet held in its beak. A girl's arm coming out of the water, white and deathly, her drowned figure underneath. \nROCHESTER Where did you get your copies? \nJANE Out of my head. \nROCHESTER That head I now see on your shoulders? \nJANE Yes sir. \nHe turns the next. The top of a hill. An expanse of twilight sky. Rising up, a girl's shape, her forehead crowned with a star, red hair flowing; Helen Burns. \nROCHESTER Who's this? \nJANE The evening star. \nRochester gives her a direct gaze. \nROCHESTER Why did you bewitch my horse? \nJane cannot reply. \nINT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE NURSERY. \nJane is by the blackboard, where she is writing sums. \nADELE Tonight I will have my cadeaux. He always bring me a cadeaux. \nMrs Fairfax breathlessly enters. \nMRS FAIRFAX Sorry to disturb. He's asked for your art. \nJane looks at her in disbelief. \nJANE What for? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 44. \nMRS FAIRFAX He wishes to have it. \nJANE Why? \nMRS FAIRFAX To show to his company, I should think. Is this it here? Thank you. \nJane watches helplessly as Mrs Fairfax takes her portfolio. \nINT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE HALL/LANDING. \nJane is crossing the landing holding Adele's hand. Downstairs, the library doors swing wide open. The sound of male laughter can be heard; gentlemen walk out into the hall. Rochester follows, walking with a stick. \nADELE Monsieur! \nAll eyes turn upon the landing. Jane tries to find a shadow to back into but there are none. Adele curtsies. \nROCHESTER Ah, there she is... \nIt is unclear whether he is referring to Adele or Jane. He makes a bow. The men are staring at Jane with great curiosity. It makes her uncomfortable. She tugs Adele away. \nINT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE DRAWING ROOM. \nA box tied with ribbons sits on the table. \nADELE Ma boite, ma boite! \nRochester is leaning against the mantelpiece, drinking. \nROCHESTER Take it away you genuine daughter of Paris and amuse yourself with disembowelling it. \nJANE How? \nROCHESTER Your openness, your clear conscience, your unpolluted mind. If I were eighteen I think we truly would be equals. Nature meant me to be a good man, one of the better kind and as you see, I am not so. \nJANE Are you a villain then, sir? \nROCHESTER I'm a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the dissipations that the rich and worthless try to put on life. (HE SIGHS) When I was your age, fate dealt me a blow. I was - cursed with a burden to carry through life. I lacked the wisdom to remain cool and I turned desperate. Dread remorse, Miss Eyre. It is the poison of life. \nRochester takes in her open, compassionate face. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) And since happiness is denied me, I've a right to get pleasure in its stead. And I will get it, cost what it may. \nJANE Then you'll degenerate still more. \nROCHESTER Are you preaching to me? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 49. \nJANE I'm reminding you of your own words; remorse is the poison of life. \nROCHESTER But, Miss Eyre, if the pleasure I was seeking was sweet and fresh; if it was an inspiration; if it wore the robes of an angel of light... what then? \nJANE I don't know. To speak truth, I don't understand you at all. \nROCHESTER My heart has long been a charnel house. Perhaps it'll transform into a shrine. \nJANE Sir, I find the conversation has got out of my depth. \nROCHESTER You're afraid of me because I talk like a sphynx. \nJANE I'm not afraid. \nROCHESTER Yes you are. \nJANE I've simply no wish to talk nonsense. \nROCHESTER If you did it would be in such a grave, quiet manner that I would mistake it for sense. Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre? \nThis question cuts Jane to the quick. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Only rarely, perhaps. But you're not naturally austere, any more than I'm naturally vicious. I can see in you the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive. Were it but free, it would soar. Cloud high. \nJane opens her mouth to speak - but she cannot. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 50. \nEXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS. SPRING. \nJane is playing battledore and shuttlecock with Adele. Her playing is full of energy, very free. Her cheeks looks almost rosy. It is spring. \nJANE Just as it turns to come down - that's when you hit it. \nAdele serves. The game continues apace. Rochester wanders out of the open double doors of the library. He watches. \nSomething lands at his feet. A rook's feather. He looks up at the battlements. A shape disappears, too fast to see. Rochester's features cloud over with an expression of shame and detestation. He stands in a terrible inner conflict. \nJane notices him - she misses her shot. \nJANE (CONT'D) Mademoiselle has got to rest. \nADELE Because I start to win! \nJANE Have mercy, Adele. Play with Pilot for a while. \nRochester is leaning over the balustrade, his head bowed. \nJANE (CONT'D) Is our game disturbing you, sir? \nHe looks up. A hard and cynical expression has mastered his countenance, something resolute. Jane is taken aback. \nROCHESTER On the contrary. I like your game. I like this cold, hard day. I like Thornfield. \nRochester picks up the black feather. He starts to walk across the grounds at a fast pace. Jane follows. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) I've been arranging a point with my destiny, Miss Eyre. My destiny stood up there by that chimney, like one of the hags who appeared to Macbeth. 'You like Thornfield?' She said. 'Like it if you dare'. Well, I dare. It's felt like a plague house for years - \nHe turns, the whole house now in his sights. He shouts: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 51. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) But Thornfield is my home and I shall like it! \nAdele is running after them. \nADELE Mademoiselle - Il faut jouer - \nRochester snaps at her with shocking ferocity. \nROCHESTER Get back! Keep at a distance child, or go in! \nAdele's face crumples into tears. Rochester sees Jane's shock at his outburst. He walks away. \nJane isn't sure whether she has been dismissed or not. Adele has run back to Pilot. Jane watches her. She suddenly finds Rochester is back at her side. He walks her along. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) She's the daughter of an opera dancer, Celine Varens. Celine was a beauty and she professed to love me. Her ardour was so great that, ugly as I am, I believed myself her idol. So I installed in her in a hotel, gave her servants, gowns cashmeres, diamonds - in short, I was an idiot. \nJANE To fall in love, sir? \nJANE Only the candle on the ground. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 55. \nROCHESTER But you heard a laugh? \nJANE Yes. \nROCHESTER Have you heard that laugh before? \nJANE There's a woman who sews here; Grace Poole - She laughs in that way, I think. \nROCHESTER Just so. Grace Poole - you have guessed it. Well, you're no talking fool; please say nothing about this. \nJANE BUT - \nROCHESTER I will account for this state of affairs. Go back to your room and say nothing. \nJANE Yes, sir. (She takes off his coat) Good-night. \nROCHESTER Is that how you're going to leave me? \nJANE You said I should go. \nRochester approaches her. \nROCHESTER Jane, fire is a horrible death. You have saved my life. Don't walk past me as if we were strangers. \nJANE What am I to do then, sir? \nROCHESTER At least... shake hands. \nRochester holds out his hand. Jane takes it. They shake. Rochester wraps Jane's hand in both of his. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 56. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) I have a pleasure in owing you my life. \nJANE There is no debt. \nROCHESTER I knew you would do me good in some way. I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you. Their expression did not - did not strike delight into my very inmost being so, for nothing. People talk of natural sympathies... You. \nRochester is drawing her slowly closer. Jane, disconcerted, is trying to resist. \nJANE Good night then, sir. \nROCHESTER So you will leave me? \nJANE I'm cold. \nROCHESTER Go. \nAt last, he relaxes his grip. She backs away. She goes. \nINT. DAWN. THORNFIELD. JANE'S ROOM. \nJane is keeling on the windowsill, looking out at the rising sun. She is lit by its glowing rays; inspired. It's a rare feeling that prompts her mood, as new and unfolding as the day itself - happiness. \nINT. DAY. THORNFIELD - ROCHESTER'S ROOM. \nJane looks in to see Leah and Martha cleaning the soot from the woodwork and windowpanes. To her amazement, Grace Poole is there, calmly sewing rings to new curtains. \nGRACE Good day to you, miss. \nJANE What's happened here? \nGRACE (CANNILY) Only master reading in his bed last night. (MORE) Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 57. \nGRACE (CONT'D) Fell asleep with his candle lit and the curtains got on fire. Managed to put it out with the water from his stand. Did you not hear anything, miss? \nJANE I did. I heard a strange laugh. \nGRACE It's hardly likely the master would laugh when he was in such danger. Perhaps you were dreaming. \nJANE I was not. \nGRACE Then you didn't think of opening your door and looking out? \nJane is infuriated. She turns on her heel. \nINT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR. \nJane walks in. Their meal is laid out. \nJANE Has Mr Rochester not sent for us today? \nMRS FAIRFAX Why, he's gone away. Were you not aware? He left after breakfast. \nJane takes this piece of news like an invisible shock. \nMRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D) He's gone to The Leas, Mr Eshton's place, about ten miles from here. I believe Blanche Ingram is there. She's a great favourite of his. \nJANE Oh? \nMRS FAIRFAX I saw her two years ago when Mr Rochester had a party here. Oh, she was a beauty; I daresay the most elegant girl I've ever seen. So tall, with raven hair cascading down her back; I don't know how she'd had it done. She sang a duet with Mr Rochester. They made a lovely harmony. (MORE) Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 58. \nJANE May I assist you, Mrs Fairfax? \nWe see Mrs Fairfax approach Jane in a rush of gratitude. \nINT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR. \nJane wears a housekeeper's apron over her dress. She enters Rochester's room with an armful of bed linen. It has been returned to its former glory. Adele is jumping up and down on the bed. Sophie is trying to coax her off it. Jane gives Sophie the sheets. \nAdele leaves the room with Jane and skids all the way down the newly polished gallery in her stockinged feet. Jane can't help smiling. \nINT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE KITCHENS. \nJane sets down several bottles of wine on the kitchen table in order to dust them. The kitchen is a hive of activity - except for one lone figure sitting quietly in a chair by the fire, smoking a pipe; Grace Poole. Leah and one of the hired under cooks are talking abut her. \nUNDER COOK She gets good wages, I'd guess? \nLEAH Wish I had as good; not one fifth what Mrs Poole receives. \nJane affects not to listen, but is keenly interested. \nLEAH (CONT'D) And she's laying it all by. I shouldn't wonder if she's saved enough to keep her independent. \nUNDER COOK She's a good hand, I daresay. \nLEAH Not everyone could do it, that's for sure, not even for the money. \nUNDER COOK No wonder the master relies on HER - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 62. \nLeah notices Jane's curious glance. She nudges the under cook. Jane, picks up the bottles and carries them away. As she passes she hears: \nUNDER COOK (CONT'D) Doesn't she know? \nAt that moment, Adele rushes in. \nADELE They're here! They're here! \nMrs Fairfax tries to get her apron off. She becomes flustered. Jane helps her. \nMRS FAIRFAX Thank you. \nMrs Fairfax and Adele go. Jane looks out of the window. \nHer attention is focussed on two equestrians who lead the arriving party; Rochester and Blanche, the dark beauty at his side. She is laughing at something. The sun shines behind her. Jane is dazzled. She turns away. \nINT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR. \nJane comes up the back stairs and on to the gallery, just as the ladies start to issue from their rooms. She stands back in a dark corner. \nThere is an approach of chatter; a subdued vivacity. A flurry of multicoloured silks, lace and velvets go by. They descend the staircase as noiselessly as a bright mist. \nJane steps out. She walks right into the path of Blanche Ingram, who is dressed in white. They both startle. \nJANE Excuse me, miss. \nBlanche gives her a look of ice. Rochester is at the top of the stairs. \nROCHESTER Good evening. \nThey both turn. Rochester has seen Blanche, not Jane. He offers her his arm, his gaze full of admiration. Jane sinks back into the shadows. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) May I? \nBlanche lays her gloved hand on Rochester's arm, barely touching him. They glide away. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 63. \nINT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE HALL. \nAdele and Jane sit on the stairs, listening to Blanche and Rochester sing. Their voices thrill. Jane is trying not to feel. But when Rochester hits an exceptionally beautiful note, she involuntarily closes her eyes. \nAdele leans into Jane. She is crying. \nJANE What is it, darling? \nADELE She sing like Maman. \nJane, full of compassion, takes Adele back to her room. \nINT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE SCHOOLROOM. \nMrs Fairfax enters in a great hurry. \nMRS FAIRFAX Tonight. He wants you both in the drawing room after dinner. \nAdele leaps up, delighted. Jane is crestfallen. \nJANE Not me, surely. \nMRS FAIRFAX It's his particular wish. \nJANE He was being polite. \nMRS FAIRFAX I'm instructed to tell you that if you resist, he'll come up and get you himself. You needn't stay long. Just let him see you and then slip away. Don't worry; no one'll look at you. \nJANE Teaching Adele. \nROCHESTER You look pale. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 67. \nJANE I am well. \nROCHESTER You're depressed; your eyes are shining with tears. What's the meaning of this? \nJane catches sight of Mrs Fairfax, who is watching them with an expression of unease. Rochester glares at her. \nMRS FAIRFAX A gentleman has arrived to see you, sir. \nROCHESTER Who? \nMRS FAIRFAX He says he's travelled a long way, from Spanish Town, Jamaica - \nRochester seems winded. \nMRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D) And indeed I think he must have come from some hot country because he won't take off his coat. \nROCHESTER Spanish Town... \nMRS FAIRFAX Mr Richard Mason. He says you're old friends. I've put him in the morning room. \nRochester cannot speak. \nMRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D) Have I done wrong? \nROCHESTER Not at all. Please tell him I'll see him directly. \nMrs Fairfax goes. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Oh Jane - Jane. This is a blow. \nJANE Can I help you sir? \nIn the drawing room, Blanche's prelude finishes to enthusiastic applause. Rochester has Jane's hand. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 68. \nROCHESTER Jane, if all those people came and spat at me, what would you do? \nJANE Turn them out of the room sir, if I could. \nROCHESTER And if they cast you out for adhering to me? \nJANE I should care nothing about it. \nROCHESTER You'd dare censure for my sake? \nJane is frightened of his passion. \nJANE For the sake of any friend who deserved it. \nRochester lets her hand go. He steps back. He goes to the morning room. Jane peers through the door, worrying how her last words have given offence. \nShe sees a man rising to meet Rochester; handsome but gaunt and painfully thin. His smile doesn't reach his eyes - as if his soul is not quite his own. \nMASON Fairfax... \nROCHESTER Richard. How the devil are you? \nThey embrace, Rochester doing a fine impression of delight. \nINT. DAY. LOWOOD - THE HALL. \nJane is standing on the pedestal of infamy, ten years old. Helen Burns is walking towards her with something in her arms. The rising sun is all around her. \nHELEN He is yours. \nJane looks down at the bundle. In it, is a newborn boy. Jane looks up to ask Helen for help. But Helen has gone. \nJane alone with her burden, teeters on the stool. The baby starts to cry. Jane panics. \nThe crying becomes deafening, terrifying. It is not a baby's cry but a human scream. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 69. \nINT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM/ THE GALLERY. \nJane wakes, hearing a savage, sharp shriek of such power and intensity it seems to tear the night in two. \nOverhead, the sounds of a struggle begin - a deadly one. Jane hears footsteps rush past her door. She starts to pull on her dress. She hears a man's voice from above: \nMASON (O.S.) Help! Rochester, for God's sake come! \nA great stamp on the floor above; something falls with a thud; silence. Jane grabs her candle and leaves her room. \nThe guests likewise are all issuing from their rooms; some with candles, some stumbling into the dark. The gallery is filling with terrified ladies and shocked gentlemen. Their shadows dance grotesquely on the walls. \nLADY INGRAM Oh what is it? \nBLANCHE Who is hurt? \nLORD INGRAM Where the devil is Rochester? \nJANE It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir. \nROCHESTER It is slime and cobwebs. \nEXT. DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE ORCHARD. \nThe orchard is a different world; the dawn light illuminating dewy trees. Rochester is silent. Jane is trying to fathom him. \nJANE Will Grace Poole stay here now? \nROCHESTER Oh yes, don't trouble your head about her. \nJANE But sir - \nROCHESTER Grace Poole is not the danger. \nHe walks off, pulling the heads off flowers as he passes. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) You've noticed my tender feelings for Miss Ingram? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 73. \nJANE Yes sir. \nROCHESTER Keep vigil with me again, the night before I marry. For now you've met my lovely one and you know her. She's a rare one, isn't she? \nJANE Yes sir. \nROCHESTER A strapper, a real strapper; big and buxom... \nHe throws a cankered rose across the orchard. Jane manages to articulate her anxiety. \nJANE I'd do anything for you sir, anything that was right. \nROCHESTER (GENTLY) And if I ever bid you do what was wrong, you'd turn to me, quiet and pale and say 'I cannot do it.' And you'd be as immutable as a fixed star. \nRochester, gazing at her, seems to have decided something. He turns a corner and is gone. Jane is left alone. We hear the sound of a blow. \nINT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE WINDOW SEAT. \nThe brutal face of John Reed, aged fourteen, triumphant after hitting Jane. \nJOHN That's for the look you had on your face. \nINT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE BILLIARD ROOM. \nJane enters as Rochester helps Blanche to line up a shot. He is leaning intimately over her. She coyly permits him. \nJANE Excuse me, sir. \nJane has ruined Blanche's shot. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 74. \nBLANCHE Does that creeping creature want you? \nINT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE LONG GALLERY. \nRochester has followed Jane out of the billiard room. \nJANE If you please, I want leave of absence for a week or two. \nROCHESTER What to do? \nJane shows him the letter. \nJANE This is from my old nurse, Bessie. She says my cousin John Reed is dead. He ruined himself and has committed suicide. The news has so shocked his mother, my Aunt, that it's brought on a stroke. \nROCHESTER What good can you do her? \nJANE She's been asking for me. I parted from her very badly and I can't neglect her wishes now. \nROCHESTER Promise me you won't stay long. \nJANE Sir, it seems you are soon to be married. \nROCHESTER What of it? \nJANE Adele should go to school. \nROCHESTER To get her out of my bride's way who might otherwise trample her? \nJANE And I must seek another situation. I intend to advertise. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 75. \nROCHESTER At your peril you advertise. Trust it to me. I'll find you a good situation in time. \nHe is on the point of returning to the billiard room. \nJANE And sir? Forgive me but I have had no wages as yet. \nROCHESTER How much do I owe you? \nJANE Fifteen pounds. \nRochester looks in his wallet. \nIt is teeming with rain. Rochester and Jane run to the front entrance. He holds his jacket around her. Lightning. They reach the dry hearth inside. Thunder. They are both euphoric, breathless, laughing. \nJANE I must go. \nROCHESTER Good night. Good night. \nHe kisses her. They kiss again. Jane will not let him go. \nJANE Good night. \nAs Jane runs upstairs she sees Mrs Fairfax, deeply shocked. \nINT. DAY. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR \nJane wears a lilac gown. Mrs Fairfax is very concerned. \nMRS FAIRFAX Have you accepted him? \nJANE Yes. \nMRS FAIRFAX Well I never would have thought. \nJane is hurt. \nJANE Am I a monster? Is it so impossible that Mr Rochester should love me? \nMRS FAIRFAX No, I've long noticed that you were a sort of pet of his. But you're so young and so little acquainted with men. I don't want to grieve you child, but let me put you on your guard. Gentlemen in his position... Let's just say they're not accustomed to marry their governesses. Until you are wed, distrust yourself as well as him. Please, keep him at a distance - \nJane has heard enough. She turns away. \nJANE Thank you. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 85. \nINT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE HALL \nJane, walking through, finds herself in Rochester's arms. She laughs as he raises her off the ground. \nROCHESTER Is this my pale elf? This sunny faced girl with the radiant eyes? \nJANE It is I, Jane Eyre sir. \nROCHESTER Soon to be Jane Rochester. \nJANE It can never be, sir. Human beings were not meant to enjoy complete happiness on this earth. It's too much like a fairy tale. \nROCHESTER (KISSING HER) Let the fairy tale begin. \nINT. DAY. A HABERDASHER'S SHOP. \nRochester is rolling out reams of beautiful silks. Jane gets more uncomfortable as she looks at them. \nROCHESTER This morning I wrote to my banker in London to send certain jewels. In a day or two I hope to pour them into you lap - \nJANE Oh, no sir - \nROCHESTER I will put the diamond chain around your neck myself - \nJANE I don't want jewels - \nROCHESTER I'll dress you in these satins - \nJANE Then you won't know me. I'll not be Jane Eyre any longer but an ape in a harlequin's jacket. Put them away. \nJane pushes the silks away. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 86. \nROCHESTER Well for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your equal. \nJANE I'm naturally proud. And hard and flinty. You ought to know what sort of bargain you've made while you've still got time to rescind it. I want only one thing from you, Mr Rochester. \nROCHESTER And what's that? \nJANE Your regard. \nJane puts her arm through Rochester's. He smiles. \nROCHESTER It's your time now, little tyrant but it'll soon be mine and when I have seized you, to have and to hold, I'll attach you to a chain, like this... \nRochester flicks his watch into the air. \nINT. DAY. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR. \nA summer gale. The moan of the wind sounds almost human. The light is sickly, nightmarish. \nA great box sits on the table, which Jane is opening. Adele, Sophie and Mrs Fairfax are all looking on. Jane pulls out a pearl coloured wedding gown. She is dismayed at its opulence. \nShe holds it up to herself. Adele starts to play with the great veil. She wraps it round herself. She becomes caught in it, tangled, distressed. \nINT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM. \nJANE Adele? \nJane wakes. There is a candle alight at the end of her bed. Her eyes focus. Her wardrobe is open. Jane is unnerved. \nBRIGGS The marriage cannot go on. I declare the existence of an impediment. \nRochester moves, shaken. \nROCHESTER Proceed. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 90. \nBRIGGS The ceremony is quite broken off. An insuperable impediment to this marriage exists. \nROCHESTER Proceed. \nBRIGGS Mr Rochester has a wife now living. \nWood is utterly dismayed. \nROCHESTER (SHOUTS) Where is your proof? \nBriggs starts to read out a document. \nBRIGGS (O.S.) I affirm and can prove that Edward Fairfax Rochester was fifteen years ago married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason at St James church, Spanish Town, Jamaica. \nJane looks at Rochester. She forces him to look at her. He denies nothing; defies everything. \nBRIGGS (CONT'D) The record of the marriage will be found in the register of that church - a copy of it is now in my possession. Signed, Richard Mason. \nRochester turns to Briggs. \nROCHESTER That does not prove that my wife is still living. \nBRIGGS She was living two months ago. \nROCHESTER How do you know? \nBRIGGS I have a witness to the fact. \nROCHESTER Produce him or go to hell. \nThe figure by the door steps out of the shadows. It is Richard Mason. Rochester flies down the aisle, a groan of rage escapes him. He lifts his arm. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 91. \nMASON Good God - \nWOOD Sir, you are in a sacred place - \nMason flinches away. Rochester swallows his rage. \nROCHESTER What have you to say? \nMASON She is at Thornfield Hall. I saw her there in April. I'm her brother. \nA grim smile contorts Rochester's lips. He turns towards Jane. She remains where she was abandoned - at the altar - tiny, under he vaulted arch. The bouquet falls from her hand. Rochester walks to her. \nROCHESTER This girl knew nothing. She thought all was fair and legal. She never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch. \nA tiny breath is the only noise Jane utters. Rochester pulls her from the altar to his side. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Come, Jane, come all of you and meet Mrs Poole's charming patient. Come and meet my wife. \nThe sun outside is blinding. Jane closes her eyes. \nI/E. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE ENTRANCE / HALL \nRochester enters pulling Jane after him, her hand still in his iron grip. Wood, Mason and Briggs follow. \nMrs Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Martha and Leah are waiting. Adele runs forward. Rochester stops her in her tracks. \nROCHESTER Get back! Do not come near! Go, all of you - keep your congratulations - they come fifteen years too late! \nAdele has crumpled into frightened tears. Mrs Fairfax has her hand over her mouth, pale with shock. Jane meets her eye as Rochester pulls her up the stairs. A revelation. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 92. \nINT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE THIRD FLOOR. \nThe tapestried room. Rochester glances at Mason. He unlocks the inner door with one hand; the other won't let go of Jane. Grace Poole sits by a strongly guarded fire, stirring something in a pot. \nRochester leads Jane and the men into the room. There is no window, no furniture except for Grace's chair; only a mattress on the floor. \nGRACE Sir, you can't be bringing folk in here. It's madness. \nBertha Antoinetta Mason stands, amazed at the sight of her visitors. She wears a white shift. There are black rook feathers twined in her hair; her only ornament. \nROCHESTER This clothed hyena is my wife. \nBertha's pose is dignified, her expression grows triumphant. She approaches Rochester - her eyes locked with Jane's. Jane gazes: fear, disgust, compassion. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) I was duped into marriage with this lunatic fifteen years ago. \nBriggs and Wood are deeply repelled. \nWOOD Let us go. We have seen enough. \nBertha puts her arm through Rochester's; lays her head on his shoulder; smiles at Jane, magnanimous in her victory. \nROCHESTER My own demon, Bertha. \nRochester perceives Jane's inanition. He carries her down the gallery. Jane clings on to her bag of belongings. She has nothing else left. \nINT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE LIBRARY. \nRochester has lain Jane in front of the fire. She forces herself to eat. Rochester gives her wine. She sips. \nROCHESTER How are you now? \nJANE Much better, sir. I shall be well again soon. \nRochester paces away to the fire. He comes back. Stoops his head down to Jane to kiss her. She turns her head away. \nROCHESTER I know you. You are thinking. Talking is no use; you are thinking how to act. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 96. \nJANE All is changed, sir. I must change too. \nROCHESTER Yes. There is no doubt that we both must change. I was wrong ever to keep you here; this narrow stone vault with its one real fiend. I'll shut it up. I'll pay Mrs Poole two hundred a year to care for its inmate and then no one will be harmed when she is prompted to burn people, to stab them, to bite the flesh from their bones - \nJANE Sir - you speak of her with hate - it is cruel. She cannot help being mad. \nROCHESTER It's not because she's mad that I hate her. If you were mad do you think that I'd hate you? \nJANE I do. \nROCHESTER Then you know nothing about me, nothing about the way I love. Your mind is my treasure - and if it were broken it would be my treasure still. You are my sympathy, my better self, my angel. I will wrap my whole existence round you. Let us leave here tomorrow. Come with me - as my wife. \nJANE No. \nROCHESTER I'll pledge you my fidelity - \nJANE You can't. \nROCHESTER You'll live a happy, most innocent life - \nJANE I must leave you, sir. \nRochester cannot take this in. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 97. \nROCHESTER Don't you love me? \nJANE I do love you - But I mustn't show it or speak it ever again. I must begin a new existence - strange scenes among strange faces. I must part from you. \nROCHESTER Must be a part of me; that's what you mean. You are my wife, Jane. In truth - \nJANE You have a wife already. \nROCHESTER I was tricked, duped into wedlock with that demon-hate, that harlot, that succubus upstairs. My father wanted her money and so I was sent to Spanish Town and the match was made. I hardly spoke with her. I was dazzled, ignorant, raw. My senses were besotted and I married her - gross, grovelling mole-eyed blockhead that I was. \nRochester sits, staring at the fire. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) I lived with her for four years. She dragged me through all the degrading agonies which attend those bound to the intemperate and unchaste. Her excesses developed germs of madness and the doctors shut her up. One night, unable to bear her screaming hate and knowing I could never be rid of her, I put a gun to my head to kill myself. \nJane is both appalled and moved. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) I would have pulled the trigger, died in that tropical place but for a breeze which blew in from the sea and smelt of home. With it, I came to my senses. Bertha Antoinetta Mason had abused my long suffering, sullied my name, outraged my honour and blighted my youth. It was enough. At that moment, as I decided to live, she ceased to be my wife. (MORE) Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 98. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Only my father and brother knew of the marriage and by then they were both dead. I let my connection with her be buried in oblivion and I brought her here. I have seen that she's cared for as her condition demands and that is all that God and humanity asks. \nJANE I earnestly pity you, sir. \nHe sees that Jane is silently crying. \nROCHESTER Jane, it's not pity that I see in your face. It's not pity - \nJANE Do not say it - \nROCHESTER It is love. \nJANE STOP - \nThey are holding each other. \nROCHESTER I was wrong to deceive you. It was cowardly. I should have appealed to your spirit - as I do now - should have opened my life, described my hunger for a better existence - shown you my chains. I give you my life. I give you my pledge. Please, be my wife. \nJANE I can not. \nROCHESTER You would be my equal. \nJANE How? \nROCHESTER I would make it so. \nJANE You once told me that hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave. \nROCHESTER Not my mistress - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 99. \nJANE I would not degrade you by having you live with a slave. \nROCHESTER I said wife, my wife - \nJane tries to rise. Rochester keeps hold of her hand. He gently pulls her down again. Comforts her. \nJANE Mr St John - What on earth brings you away from your hearth on a night like this? Has anything happened? There's no bad news I hope? \nST JOHN How easily alarmed you are. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 102. \nHe takes off his cloak; stamps the snow off his boots. \nST JOHN (CONT'D) The snow was up to my waist at one point. \nJANE You are recklessly rash about your own health. \nST JOHN Nonsense. \nSt John's eyes alight on Jane's charcoal drawing. Jane snatches it away too late. There is a moment of silence. \nJANE Why are you come? \nST JOHN An inhospitable question. \nJANE I mean on a night like this - \nST JOHN I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms. Besides I've been told half a story and I'm most impatient to find out the end. \nJANE Please... \nJane motions to St John to sit. He doesn't. She becomes increasingly uneasy as he speaks. \nST JOHN Twenty years ago, a poor curate fell in love with a rich man's daughter and married her. She was disowned by her family and two years later the rash pair were both dead. They left a daughter which charity received into her lap - as cold as that snow drift I almost stuck fast in. Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations. It was reared by an aunt-in-law; I come to names now - Mrs Reed of Gateshead. \nJane starts. She is on her feet. \nST JOHN (CONT'D) Mrs Reed kept the orphan ten years and at the end of that time she was sent to Lowood school. (MORE) Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 103. \nST JOHN (CONT'D) It seems her career there was very honourable. She became a teacher like yourself, and left it, like yourself, to be a governess. She undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr Rochester - \nJANE Mr Rivers! - \nST JOHN I can guess your feelings but hear me to the end. Of Mr Rochester's character I know nothing but he professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl and at the very altar she discovered that he had a wife yet alive. His subsequent conduct is a matter of pure conjecture but when the governess was enquired after it was discovered that she had fled Thornfield Hall and no trace of her has since been found. Now isn't that an odd tale? \nJANE Since you know so much, perhaps you can tell me how he is. \nST JOHN Who? \nJANE Mr Rochester; how is he? \nST JOHN I'm ignorant of all concerning him. \nSt John opens his pocket book and removes a piece of paper. \nST JOHN (CONT'D) Well, since you won't ask the governess's name, I must tell you. I have it written down here in black and white. \nHe hands her the paper. On it are doodled the heads of some of her pupils. She has absently written Jane Eyre in the margin several times. \nST JOHN (CONT'D) A solicitor named Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre. I knew a Jane Elliott. This paper resolved my suspicion into certainty. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 104. \nJANE The solicitor - Mr Briggs - does he have any news of Mr Rochester? \nST JOHN Are you not going to enquire why he has gone to such lengths to find you? \nJANE What does he want with me? \nST JOHN Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr John Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that he has left you all his property and that you are now rich. \nJANE What? \nST JOHN You are rich; quite an heiress. \nSilence. Jane is flabbergasted. \nST JOHN (CONT'D) Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the will and all the necessary documents. You can enter on immediate possession. \nAt last, Jane looks questioningly up at him. \nST JOHN (CONT'D) Your forehead unbends at last; I thought you were turning to stone. Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth. \nJANE How much am I worth? \nST JOHN Oh a trifle. Twenty thousand pounds - but what of that? \nThe news literally takes Jane's breath away. \nJANE Twenty thousand pounds? \nSt John begins to laugh at Jane's reaction. She has never seen him laugh before. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 105. \nST JOHN If you'd committed a murder and I'd found you out, you could scarcely look more aghast. \nJANE There must be some mistake. It's two thousand, surely. \nST JOHN It's twenty. You look desperately miserable about it, I must say. \nJane still cannot take it in. She frowns in disbelief. \nST JOHN You should look beyond Moor House, beyond the selfish calm and comfort of affluence. \nJANE Beyond to what? \nST JOHN I go to India in six weeks. \nJANE So soon? - \nSt John draws Jane away from her work. \nST JOHN I can see what your gifts are and why they were given. Come with me. \nJane is utterly crestfallen. \nST JOHN (CONT'D) God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife. You are formed for labour not for love. I want to claim you - not for my pleasure but for God's service. \nJANE I'm not fit for it. I have no vocation. \nST JOHN You're far too humble. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 109. \nJANE St John have mercy. I feel my mind shrinking - \nST JOHN Don't be afraid. You are diligent, faithful, docile, courageous, gentle and heroic. Cease to mistrust yourself. I trust you unreservedly. Let me give you time to think. But know this; in you, I recognise a fellow soul, a soul that would revel in the flame and excitement of sacrifice. \nJane is chilled to the bone by his words. St John leaves the garden and walks away over the moors. \nCUT TO: \nJane leaning against the garden wall, trying to think, trying to compose herself. The sun is setting. \nINT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - THE PARLOUR. \nJane carrying a candle, opens the door. St John is at the table working by lamp light. The moon shines brightly in. \nJANE I used to long for a life of action, to overleap the horizon, to move in the world of men. Maybe God is giving me this. And what is there for me here? Pain and longing for what can't be. I don't know how long I would survive in India. My frame isn't strong. But I'll go with you, if I may go free. \nST JOHN Free? \nJANE You and I had better not marry. \nST JOHN Why not? \nJANE Because I am your sister. \nST JOHN But you'll go with me. \nJANE Conditionally - as your curate. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 110. \nST JOHN Jane, I don't need a curate; I need a wife. \nJANE I must have my heart and mind free, my own self to turn to. I couldn't become part of you - \nST JOHN A part of me you must become or the whole bargain is void. How can I, a man not yet thirty take out to India a girl of nineteen, unless she is my wife? Don't offer God half a sacrifice. He must have all. And undoubtedly enough of love would follow to make the union right, even in your eyes. \nJane is shocked. \nJANE Enough of love? \nST JOHN Yes, quite enough. \nJANE St John, I scorn your idea of love. I scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer and I scorn you when you offer it! \nSt John is mortified. A slow rage begins to boil in him. \nST JOHN I've uttered nothing that deserves scorn. \nJANE Forgive me but the very name of love is an apple of discord between us. My dear cousin, please abandon your scheme of marriage. \nST JOHN No; and if you reject it, it's not me you deny but God. \nJane is stung. St John has turned from her. His face is icy in the moonlight. \nJANE Do not be angry with me please. It makes me wretched. I want us to be friends. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 111. \nST JOHN We are friends. I hope we can be more. \nJANE I cannot come as your wife. \nST JOHN Why this refusal? It makes no sense! \nJANE If I were to marry you, you'd kill me. You're killing me now. \nST JOHN (FURIOUS) I'd kill you? I am killing you? Your words are violent, unfeminine and untrue - \nJANE You'd kill me without drawing any blood or receiving on your conscience any stain of crime. \nST JOHN What nonsense is this? \nJANE You'd experience no pain - but I tell you it would kill me! \nST JOHN Why? \n", "test1_input": "Diana and Mary glance at each other, fascinated. \nINT. EVENING. MOOR HOUSE - THE BEDROOM \nJane is dressing herself. She stops, weakly holding the back of a chair for support, looking out of the window at the sun setting over the hills. \nST JOHN (V.O.) Merciful Jesus, enlighten thou me with the brightness of thine inward light... \nINT. EVENING. MOOR HOUSE - THE STAIRS \nDiana is helping Jane down the stairs. \nST JOHN (V.O.) And take away all darkness from the habitation of my heart... \nINT. EVENING. MOOR HOUSE - THE PARLOUR \nSt John is praying over Jane, Diana and Mary as they sit at the table. Mary catches Jane's eye, gives her shy smile. \nST JOHN Join me to thyself with an inseparable band of love... For thou, even thou alone, dost satisfy him that loveth thee... \nJane finds herself staring at St John, who prays ardently. \nST JOHN (CONT'D) And without thee all things are vain and empty. Amen. \nSt John opens his eyes and looks searchingly at Jane. She immediately looks down. \nJANE, MARY, DIANA Amen. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 19. \nDIANA Welcome to our table, Miss Elliott. \nJANE I'd appreciate it if you called me Jane. It is my own name. \nMARY It's wonderful to see you on your feet, Miss Jane. \nJane turns her attention to St John. \nJANE I trust I will not be eating long at your expense, Mr Rivers. \nST JOHN You wish to be independent of my charity? \nJANE I wish to work, sir. Show me how to work or how to seek work; that's all I ask. \nDIANA You're not fit enough to work. \nST JOHN My sisters have always taken pleasure in keeping injured birds but I'm more inclined to put you in a way of keeping yourself - and shall endeavour to do so, if that's what you wish. \nJANE With all my heart, sir. \nDIANA It's a shame she has no choice of helpers, St John, and must put up with such crusty people as you. \nST JOHN This school you were at, Miss Elliot, this charitable institution; what did it prepare you for? \nCUT TO: \nWe see a bundle of sharp twigs come down on a girl's bare neck, like a whip. \nCUT TO: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 20. \nJane flinches at the memory. \nST JOHN (CONT'D) Was it a thorough education? \nJANE Most thorough. \nINT. DAY. LOWOOD - THE HALL. \nMiss Scatcherd's bitter life is in her face and voice. \nMISS SCATCHERD Burns, Helen Burns! \nJane, aged ten, looks up. She is wearing a brown stuff frock with a puritanical cap like all the other girls. Silence reigns in the school hall. \nA red haired girl of about thirteen stands up; Helen Burns. Miss Scatcherd holds up an apron in which a hole has been mistakenly cut. \nMISS SCATCHERD (CONT'D) You're a slattern and a disgrace! \nHelen Burns undoes the back of her dress. The punishment is given; a dozen sharp, stinging whacks with the birch twigs. \nJane is appalled. But to her astonishment and awe, Helen Burns doesn't cry; she barely changes her expression. As the strokes go on - seven, eight, nine - Helen seems like one in a trance. Jane is deeply affected. \nOn the eleventh stroke, the door bursts open and a visiting party walks in: the Brocklehurst family. Miss Temple escorts two young girls dressed in peacock finery and two smart, bombastic ladies. Mr Brocklehurst follows. Helen's punishment is forgotten as the students rush to their feet. \nJane, in a panic, drops her slate and breaks it. Brocklehurst's eyes sweep the room. They land on her. \nBROCKLEHURST I might have known. The new girl. Step forward, Jane Eyre. \nFilled with dread, Jane steps forward. \nBROCKLEHURST (CONT'D) It is my duty dear children, to warn you that this girl is not one of God's own lambs. \nWe see the look of frustration on Miss Temple's face. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 21. \n", "test1_true": "He points to a tall stool. Jane stands on it. \nBROCKLEHURST (CONT'D) This is the pedestal of infamy - and you'll remain upon it all day. You'll receive no sustenance and no comfort, for you must learn how barren is the life of the sinner. Children, I exhort you to shun her, exclude her, shut her out from this day forth. Withhold the hand of friendship and deny your love to Jane Eyre, the liar. \nINT. DAY. LOWOOD - THE HALL - LATER. \nThe hall is empty but for the small figure of Jane, high on her stool, feeling her isolation like pain. Across the room is the slightly bigger figure of Helen, hunched, the back of her dress still open, the skin on her neck raw. The sun is setting. At last Jane starts to sob. \nHELEN Come now, don't cry. \nJANE You're not allowed to speak to me. I must be shunned. \nHELEN Mr Brocklehurst is not a God. He's not liked or admired here - \nJANE He said I was a liar. \nHELEN JANE - \nJANE I am not a liar! \nHELEN If your own conscience approves you, then so will I. \nJane is deeply gratified. \nJANE How do you bear it? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 22. \nHELEN Bear what? \nJANE Being struck. \nHELEN I'm a trial to Miss Scatcherd. She hits me to improve me. \nJANE If she hit me I would get that birch from her hand and break it under her nose. \nHELEN You'd just be punished even more. It's part of life here. \nJANE I have always been excluded and alone and hated. Miss Abbott used to call me an ugly little toad. \nHelen approaches Jane. \nHELEN You're not ugly. Do you know what is inside you? \nJANE What? \nHELEN The spark of your spirit, the principle of light and thought, pure and bright, as perfect as anything created. \nJANE What do you mean? \nHELEN Your soul. Your soul is beautiful, your soul has value - more value than anything on earth. \nJANE Is that true? \nHELEN Yes. God sees your beauty. Even as you stand on that stool, there is an invisible world around you, a kingdom of spirits. It is everywhere. Angels see your pain. Angels know your innocence. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 23. \nJANE Angels? \nHelen smiles a wide smile. \nHELEN Do you not believe in angels? \nThey hear the door. Helen runs back to her place; cowers. Miss Temple appears in a shaft of light at the door. \nMISS TEMPLE Come here, Girls. \nThe girls approach, dreading more punishment. \nMISS TEMPLE (CONT'D) I shall investigate Mr Brocklehurst's claims against you, Jane. And unless they are proved, you will be exonerated. \nMiss Temple looks over her shoulder. \nMISS TEMPLE (CONT'D) Also, I understand you girls have had no food today. \nShe quickly presses a slice of hard cake into each girl's hand and walks away. Jane and Helen look at one another, deeply moved by her kindness. \nEXT. DAY. MOOR HOUSE - THE GARDEN / MOORS. \nJane stands between Diana and Mary high above Moor House. They are dressed similarly in bonnets and cloaks. They watch a hawk dive, their heads moving in unison. Their eyes land upon Moor House. \nMARY We've lived here all our lives but the house must be shut up now. \nJANE Why? \nMARY We can't afford to keep it on. Diana and I will return to our charges in a few days and St John will go to his parsonage. \nDown below them, St John leaves Moor House and walks towards the village. Jane watches him. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 24. \nDIANA It'll be a hard parting for us. We may not see him again for years. \nJANE Why ever not? \nMARY He means to be a missionary. He's going to India to do Gods's work. \n", "test1_id": 1332, "test2_input": "JANE Please, let us be reconciled. \nMrs Reed shrinks from Jane's touch. Jane wipes her tears. \nJANE (CONT'D) Then love me or hate me as you will. You have my full and free forgiveness. Now ask for God's - and be at peace. \nMrs Reed's eyes close. \nINT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE RED ROOM. \nThe morning sun is pouring in. Jane goes to the bed. She puts her hand upon it, gently, as if thanking her uncle for all he did. She notices a picture on the wall. A miniature of a brown-haired woman with elfin eyes. \nJane takes it off the wall. Bessie comes in. \nJANE My mother. \nBessie nods. A tear rolls down Jane's face. She clasps the picture, looking round the room. \nJANE (CONT'D) Why ever was I so afraid? \nEXT. DAY. A ROADSIDE. \nA coach pulls up in the lane near Thornfield. Jane gets out. We hear her voice. \nJANE (V.O.) My dear uncle, some years ago, my Aunt Reed mistakenly informed you that I had died. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 79. \nEXT. EVENING. A SUMMER WOOD. \nJane is walking through the wooded glade where she first met Rochester. All is green and verdant and bathed in sunset light. There seems to be life everywhere. \nJANE (V.O.) I am writing to tell you that I am very much alive and living at Thornfield Hall, where I am currently governess to the ward of Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester - \nROCHESTER (O.S.) There you are. \nJane turns. Rochester is sitting on the stile where they first met. For a moment, her every nerve is unstrung. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Just like one of your tricks to steal into your home along with the twilight. Where the deuce have you been this last month? \nJANE I have been with my aunt sir, who is dead. \nRochester laughs. \nROCHESTER A true Janian reply. If I dared I'd touch you, to see if you were real... \nJane puts out her hand. Rochester takes it. He helps Jane over the stile. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Go home - stay your wandering feet at a friend's threshold. \nJane lets go of his hand. \nJANE Thank you Mr Rochester. I'm strangely glad to get back again to you. Wherever you are is my home. \nJane, knowing she has said too much, turns and runs over the fields towards Thornfield. \nINT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR \nJane is on a low seat, Adele nestling close to her. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 80. \nMRS FAIRFAX We're expecting the announcement very soon. He went down to London only last week to buy her a new carriage. \nJANE Then we must accept it. He'll soon bring home his bride. \nMrs Fairfax nods. \nEXT. TWILIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE ORCHARD \nJane is alone, drinking in the beauty of the evening - looking at the gardens as if she may never see them again. She turns a corner and sees Rochester staring intently at something. His back is to her. She is about to tiptoe away. \nROCHESTER Come and look at this fellow, Jane. \nJane approaches, wondering how he has sensed her presence. Rochester is looking at a huge moth. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Look at his wings. He looks West Indian - I have never seen one like him, here. There; flown. \nThey watch the moth as it flies towards the house. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, isn't it? \nJANE I'll be sad to leave it. \nROCHESTER Yes, but it can't be helped. I soon hope to be a bridegroom. \nJANE Have you found me a new situation, sir? \nROCHESTER A situation, yes of course. It's the least I can do for a faithful paid subordinate such as yourself. You're to undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs Dionysus O'Gall of Bitternut Lodge, Connaught. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 81. \nJANE Connaught? \nROCHESTER You'll like Ireland. They're such warm-hearted people, they say. \nJANE It is a long way away, sir. \n", "test2_true": "JANE From here. From you. \nROCHESTER We've been good friends, Jane haven't we? But with the Irish sea between us you'd soon forget me. \nJane's great distress escapes her. \nJANE I wish I could. I wish I'd never come here. I love Thornfield - I've lived a full life here. I've not been trampled on or petrified or buried with inferior minds. I've talked face to face with what I reverence, with what I delight in. I've known you Mr Rochester - \nROCHESTER Then why must you be torn from me? \nJANE Because of your bride. \nROCHESTER I have no bride. \nJANE But you will have. \nROCHESTER Yes, I will. \nJANE Then I must go. \nROCHESTER You must stay. \nJANE Do you think I could stay to become nothing to you? Am I an automaton, a machine without feelings? (MORE) Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 82. \nJANE (CONT'D) Do you think that because I am poor, obscure, plain and little that I am soulless and heartless? \nROCHESTER JANE - \nJANE I have as much soul as you and full as much heart. I'm not speaking to you through mortal flesh. It's my spirit that addresses your spirit as if we'd passed through the grave and stood at God's feet, equal - as we are. \nRochester takes Jane in his arms. \nROCHESTER As we are. \nJane struggles away from him. \nJANE Let me go. \nROCHESTER NO - \nJANE I'm a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you. \nRochester releases her. She stands in front of him. \nROCHESTER Then let your will decide your destiny. I offer you my hand, my heart and a share of all this. \nHe gestures towards the house, the land. Jane is stunned. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) I ask you to pass through life at my side. Jane, you are my equal and my likeness. It is you I intend to marry. \nJANE Are you mocking me? \nROCHESTER Do you doubt me? \nJANE Entirely. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 83. \nROCHESTER You have no faith in me? \nJANE Not a whit. \nROCHESTER You little sceptic. \nJANE Your bride is Miss Ingram - \nROCHESTER What love have I for Miss Ingram? What love has she for me? I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was lost and got instant coldness. I wanted to make you jealous, to move you to love me. It's you - you strange, unearthly thing. I love you as my own flesh. You - poor and obscure as you are - please accept me as your husband. \nJane begins to believe him. \nJANE Are you in earnest? \nROCHESTER I must have you for my own. \nJANE You wish me to be your wife? \nROCHESTER I swear it. \nJANE You love me. \nROCHESTER I do. \nJANE Then sir, I will marry you. \nThey embrace. \nNeither Jane nor Rochester moves. Darkness is almost complete. Still the intensity of the embrace is held. \nROCHESTER It will atone. It will atone. \nA sheet of lightning momentarily lights up the sky. Some moments later a distant rumble of thunder. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 84. \nI/E. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE FRONT HALL \n", "test2_id": 1333, "test3_input": "I/E. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE FRONT DOOR/GROUNDS. \nRochester, unshaven and unkempt is standing at his threshold. \nMRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) Shut himself up like a hermit. He only went out at night, when he walked like a ghost through the grounds. \nWe see what he is looking at: an open carriage piled with luggage, into which Mrs Fairfax is helping Adele. Leah and Sophie are already sitting inside, dressed for a journey. \nMRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) (CONT'D) He'd have no one near him. Adele was sent off to school. He placed me here. Only John and Martha stayed - and Mrs Poole of course. \nAdele looks back at Rochester with tears in her eyes. He walks across the dark hall and slams the library doors. \nEXT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE ORCHARD. \nRochester, in his shirt sleeves, is looking at the tree where Jane promised him her hand - now dying, cleft by lightning. The rising moon inhabits the sky. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 115. \nMRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) It was harvest time when it happened. No one knows how she got out. \nRochester hears a cry from the top floor. He sets off, a look of finality on his face. \nINT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE KITCHEN. \nGrace Poole is asleep, her empty jug of gin beside her. \nMRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) My theory is that when Mrs Poole was asleep, having taken too much of the gin and water... \nRochester takes Grace's keys. \nINT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE THIRD FLOOR \nRochester opens the door to the inner chamber. \nMRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) ... The mad lady must have stolen her keys and let herself out. \nBertha Antoinetta Mason, standing in the last patch of daylight thrown down from her skylight, sees that it is Rochester. She calmly walks towards him. \nRochester graciously bows, indicating that she may leave. Bertha glides past him. She is free. \nINT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE GALLERY \nBertha walks past an elegant vase. She tips it to the floor. It smashes. Rochester pays it no heed. \nINT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE LIBRARY. \nRochester has stood Bertha at his desk. A case of jewels is open before her. She has put on a tiara, a diamond necklace, bracelets. She is gazing at a ruby brooch. She turns to Rochester. His expression is calm, resigned. Bertha begins to laugh. \nShe takes the candelabra from the table. She admires herself in the mirror; her white shift, the black feathers, the jewels. She holds up the candelabra and sets the huge curtains alight. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 116. \nRochester is impassive; he does nothing to stop her. As she passes, Rochester realises he is bleeding. She has run the brooch pin across him. \nINT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE HALL/STAIRS. \nBertha knocks a lamp onto the floor. The oil springs into flames, licking the tapestries and the paintings. Rochester sees his ancestors begin to burn. \nINT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR \nThe conflagration is growing. Rochester sees Bertha leaving Jane's room. As he passes, he sees everything inside it being consumed by fire. He can't bear to look. \nEXT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE LEADS. \nBertha is watching the rooks. Rochester goes to the edge of the roof. Bertha looks at him. The invitation is clear. Rochester is ready to die. \nBertha sees the rooks wheeling away. She runs at the edge of the roof. Rochester sees her intention too late. He puts out his arm to stop her. \nFor the perfect fraction of a second, Bertha flies. Rochester sees her fall; almost falls himself - saves himself. \nLife reawakens in him. Behind him, he sees Grace Poole, coughing, crawling up through the door. \nGRACE Antoinetta? \nResponsibility floods over him. He goes to her side, lifts Grace, helps her down the stairs. \nMRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) He didn't leave the house until everyone was out. Some say it was a just judgement on him for having her confined there all those years but for my part, I pity him. \nINT. DAY. MRS FAIRFAX'S COTTAGE \nJane is deeply affected. \nMRS FAIRFAX He's alive child, but many think he'd be better off dead. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 117. \nJANE Why? \nMRS FAIRFAX When he was taken out from under the ruins, a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him, partly - but his eye was taken out and his left hand so crushed that he lost it. The other eye inflamed and - he is blind. He's blind. \nTears fall from Jane's eyes. \nMRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D) I know... it's a terrible thing. \nJANE I had dreaded worse. I'd dreaded he was mad. \nA great sense of urgency is coming over her. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. DAY. FERNDEAN - THE GROUNDS. \nJane is walking through forest, along a grass grown track. Her pace is fast; her journey almost at an end. She comes to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between granite pillars. She walks through them. \nShe finds herself in front of a decrepit Elizabethan manor house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe. Jane stops. \nStanding on the threshold is Edward Fairfax Rochester. He is in his shirtsleeves. He stands strong, stalwart, brooding. His hair is still raven black. He is looking sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of a hawk. His strength is undiminished. \nHe walks fifteen paces from the house. It brings him into the middle of the semicircle of grass. He is close enough for Jane to see his scarred eyes. She walks towards him, silent. \nA few drops of rain begin to fall. Rochester puts out his right hand to feel them. He raises his face up to the sky as if he is looking for something from there. He is absolutely still; his expression, serene. \nJane is very close. She steps on a twig. It breaks with a loud crack, shattering the silence. Rochester is immediately on guard, his expression turning wary. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 118. \nHe suddenly swipes the air with his left arm; the ruin of it passing an inch from her face. Jane steps back. Rochester swipes again. She holds her breath. \nHe seems satisfied at last that nothing is there. He turns and walks fifteen paces back to the house. He disappears into the dark interior. \nJane starts to breathe again. \nEXT. DAY. FERNDEAN - THE SIDE ENTRANCE. \nJane lightly taps on the side door. Martha opens it; she is astonished. Jane puts her finger over her lips. \nINT. EVENING. FERNDEAN - THE DRAWING ROOM. \nRochester is in an armchair in front of his fire. Pilot is at his feet. Jane carries in a tray with a candelabra and a jug of water. \nROCHESTER I can see the candles, Martha, at your side like a luminous glow. And the fire; a red haze. \nPilot notices Jane. He leaps up with a whine, wagging his tail, madly. Jane spills half the water. She cannot help finding it funny. Her entrance has been ruined by the dog. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Martha? \nJane giggles. Rochester's face falls. \nROCHESTER (CONT'D) Martha, is that you? \nJANE Martha is in the kitchen, sir. \nROCHESTER Who's there? \nJANE Pilot knows me. Will you have some more water? I've spilt half the glass. \nRochester stands, holding out his hand. \nROCHESTER If you are real, touch me. \nJane touches his fingers; puts her hand in his. Rochester pulls her into his arms. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 119. \nROCHESTER, Her hand, her shape, her size. \nJANE And her voice. \nROCHESTER Jane Eyre - Jane Eyre. \nJANE My Edward, I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out. I am come back to you. \nFor some while neither is able to speak. \nROCHESTER You're not lying dead in some ditch?

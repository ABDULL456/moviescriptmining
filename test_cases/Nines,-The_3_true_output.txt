MELISSA Shit.   Like a ghost? 
GAVIN I guess. And then I saw something. I ran into someone. 
MELISSA The woman? 
GAVIN It was a man. I think it was me. 
A beat while Melissa processes. 
MELISSA Your house is haunted by yourself? 
GAVIN Yeah. 
MELISSA Gavin, are you alright? 
GAVIN No.    No. 
He takes a long beat, psyching himself up.    What spills out is heartfelt but clearly rehearsed. 
GAVIN (CONT'D) The network wants to replace you. 
MELISSA Oh my God. 
GAVIN And I'm letting them, because I really want the show on the air. I have all these characters inside my head, and they want to live. I'm the only way they can. This is the only way they can. I have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes. I had to make a decision, and that's the decision I made. I'm sorry. 
By the end of it, we can hear the emotion in his voice. Melissa takes a beat to process. 
MELISSA So it's done. Finished.   Decided. 
GAVIN Yes. 
MELISSA I understand. It's not your fault. You're morally incapable of doing the right thing. 
Gavin doesn't rise to the challenge. 
MELISSA (CONT'D) Don't get me wrong. I think you do feel bad for me. But that's all you feel for me. You still see me as the fat girl you call on Friday night when a date falls through. Let's go to a movie! Let's go to Fubar! And if you meet a hot piece of ass, don't worry about Melissa, you can apologize tomorrow. Or don't! Same difference. It's not like we're actually friends. 
GAVIN I don't want to do this on camera. 
MELISSA No, because you can't control it. Your little puppets are off their strings, running around. Saying things you didn't write. Reality terrifies you. 
GAVIN Reality. 
MELISSA Yes. 
GAVIN The reality is, you would not be here without me. I gave you your first few roles. And your career is a result of that. 
With exaggerated relief... 
MELISSA God, thank you. Thank you for finally playing that card. I always knew you were holding onto it, the "I invented Melissa McCarthy card." Congratulations, you win. The game is over. 
She gets up to go, then decides she has one more thing to say: 
MELISSA (CONT'D) Don't you ever pity me again. 
She leaves him sitting at the table.

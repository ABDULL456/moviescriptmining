No one knows why, not even me. My father says it is a dark talent and the day I take it into my head to stop breathing will be my last. \nToday he married me to a man I've not yet met. Soon my daughter and I shall join him in his own country. My husband said my muteness does not bother him. He writes and hark this: God loves dumb creatures, so why not he! \nWere good he had God's patience for silence affects everyone in the end. The strange thing is I don't think myself silent, that is, because of my piano. I shall miss it on the journey. \nSc 2     EXT     SCOTTISH FIELD NEAR HOUSEDAY     Sc 2 \nA woman in a dark crepe Victorian dress sits leaning against a tree, her hands cover her face, around her neck she wears a writing pad. She crosses a field with large bare trees, in the far background stands a 3 storey stone house. \nSc 3     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE CORRIDOR     DAY     Sc 3 \nA small girl roller skates down a dimly lit corridor. A parlour maid looks down the hall where the girl has disappeared. \nSc 4     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE DRAWING ROOMDAY     Sc 4 \nThree men wearing long grey aprons are fitting the packing for a piano. On one of the men's arms is a tattoo of a whale in a wild sea. \nSc 5     EXT     SCOTTISH HOUSE GROUNDS     DAY     Sc 5 \nThe girl wearing her skates sits on a small black pony. An old man is pulling it, but it won't move. (In the background, another aspect of the grey stone house.) \nSc 6     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE FLORA'S BEDROOM NIGHTSc 6 \nThe woman lifts back the sheets from the bottom of the sleeping girl's bed. She is still wearing her skates. The woman cuts through the laces and removes the boots. One disembodied skate rolls across the room. \nSc 7     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE DRAWING ROOMNIGHT     Sc 7 \nThe woman stands at a window lit by moonlight. Her skin appears luminescently white. She touches the wooden window frame, the curtain, the objects on the window sill, her mind abstracted, her hands unconsciously performing a farewell. Turning from the window she moves to a square piano crowded by packing boxes. In the dim light she begins to play strongly. Her face strains, she is utterly involved, unaware other own strange guttural sounds that form an eerie accompaniment to the music. \nAn old maid in night-dress looks in. Abruptly the woman stops playing. The emotion leaves her face, it whitens and seems solid like a wall. \nCUT TO BLACK \nSc 8     EXT     UNDERWATER BEACH          DAY     Sc 8 \nUnder water a long boat passes overhead, its oars breaking the surface. \nSc 9     EXT     BEACH                    DAY     Sc 9 \nSc 14     EXT     BEACH                         DUSK     Sc 14 \nThere is just a pink streak left in the sky. ADA and FLORA shelter inside their make-shift tent, a hooped petticoat secured at the edges with stones.  Inside the tent a candle lights up their conversation. \nADA is hand signaling a story to FLORA who lies back watching, nervous and afraid. ADA's whole self is involved in the \"telling\", her face is alight with expression, now tender, now sad, now humorous, now soft, while her hands and fingers are deft and precise. From outside it is an odd shadow play. \nFLORA (hand signaling) Mother... I'm thinking \nADA pauses. \n(speaking) I'm not going to call him Papa.  I'm not going to call HIM anything. I'm not even going to look at HIM. \nSc 15     EXT     BUSH ON WAY TO BEACH          DAY     Sc 15 \nThrough a dense bush walk a party of fourteen MAORI people and two EUROPEAN MEN. The wetness, closeness and darkness of the bush is such that the air seems green, like at the bottom of a deep sea. Two of the MAORIS share one pair of shoes and all of them are clothed in a mixture of native and European costume. Of the Europeans one is small and has a shy manner. He has a half completed Maori tattoo across his cheeks. The other is a similar age about 45 and wears a suit, muddy and out of place here in the bush. He staggers, spurts forward then slows to a stop. His hair and face are wet and his skin reflects the green foliage. BAINES the younger man turns and slows. \nBAINES Are we stopping?... Do you want to stop? \nThe MAORI voices and laughter are becoming fainter. BAINES watches torn between his concern for STEWART and the split in their party. \n3-See Notes \nBAINES Shall we stop? \nUnable to get an answer BAINES runs after the MAORIS. \nBAINES Tai hoa! Me tatari tatou .., me tutatou I konei. (Wait! We are stopping.. we're stopping.) SUBTITLED \nSTEWART takes out a comb and drags it dazed and zombie like through his wet hair. Inside the darkness of his pocket, he turns over and over a small, worn edged photograph, a smudge of green light allows us to see ADA's tumbling face. Taking it in the heel of his hand he secretly looks at it. Just as the party return and settle he stares on ahead possessed and determined. \nSTEWART We must get on. \nThe MAORIS look at BAINES bewildered. \nTAME Aue tepatupsiarehe! (The fairy people, what can you expect?) SUBTITLED \nSc 16     EXT     BEACH                     MORNINGSc 16 \nIt is early morning. The sea is calmer and the tide is again low. The party or two EUROPEANS and fourteen MAORI MEN and WOMEN come out on to the beach. About half the MAORI party head straight for the shoreline where an older woman loudly organises a pipi collection. All sorts of containers are used from flax baskets to shirts with knots in their arms. The rest follow STEWART and BAINES over to the boxes. STEWART automatically re-combs his hair, patting it against his forehead, where it sticks in a raked pattern. On his head he carefully places a formal top hat, oddly dean compared to his mud splattered suit. The party stops short of the petticoats where a tell-tale foot reveals its occupants. \nSTEWART Miss McGrath, Alisdair Stewart. You'll have to wake yourself. I've got men here to carry your things. \nADA and FLORA struggle up to find themselves confronted by a group of men and women. The MAORIS stare curiously and comment on the women. \nAut he anahera enci? (Are they angels, they look like angels.) SUBTITLED \nA man points at FLORA's feet and gestures as if holding one of the little shoes in his hand. \nTe monohi hoki! (So small!) SUBTITLED \nFLORA is struck by shyness and hides under her mother's skirt. ADA cannot look straight at STEWART and STEWART also cannot look at her. \nSTEWART I see you have a good many boxes, I'd like to know what is in each. \nAs ADA does not move STEWART is puzzled. \nSTEWART CAN - YOU - HEAR - ME? \nSTEWART looks at FLORA \nFLORA She wants it to come. \nSTEWART Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY \nADA writes \"I NEED THE PIANO.\" Her MAORI mimic copies her. \nSTEWART Do you mean you don't want your kitchenware or your clothes? Is that what you mean? \nADA signs to FLORA. \nFLORA We can't leave the piano \nSTEWART Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased.... \nSTEWART slows down as he watches ADA again sign to FLORA, he has the uncomfortable impression he is being interrupted. \nFLORA Mother wants to know if they could come back directly for it? \nSTEWART is shocked, his mouth hangs slightly open, paused in mid speech. TAHU mimics this mouth drop perfectly. \nFLORA After they have taken the other things? \nSTEWART is growing confused and anxious. His two mimics and their growing audience unnerve him further. \nPITO Kei Riri a te raho Maroke. (shouted loudly at TAHU) (Watch it dry balls is getting touchy.) \nSUBTITLED \nSTEWART nods suspiciously towards the MAORI speaker not understanding him, the speaker smiles and nods back. \nSTEWART I suggest you prepare for a difficult journey. The bush will tear clothes and the mud is deep in places. \nSTEWART walks away. ADA stands beside the piano turned away from the activities. FLORA pats her hand trying to cheer her. Down on the beach a fire is lit and pipis are prepared for cooking. Some of the young men are racing naked into the sea. \nSTEWART (to BAINES about the MAORIS) What are they doing? We don't have time for that. \nSc 17     EXI     BEACH                         DAY     Sc 17 \nIt is some hours later and the carrying party are beginning to make their way up into the bush. ADA still stands beside her piano. FLORA wants to follow the party. BAINES comes back along the beach, trailed by a young Maori boy, KAHA. \nBAINES Mr. Stewart asked if I might show you to the path. (ADA does not move) ... May I carry something? \nADA turns to BAINES, her face angry and defiant, her eyes full of tears. BAINES falls back, struck by her show of emotion. ADA and FLORA walk past him toward the bush. \nSc 18     EXT     CLIFF ABOVE BEACH               DAY     Sc 18 \nThe party threads its way through the bush along the cliff. ADA pauses at the cliff top to see her piano below on the sand, tiny and desolate. Its distance and her love of it suddenly strike her. Its music is faint and becomes loud over the next scene. \nSc 19     EXT     BUSH FROM BEACH               DAY     Sc 19 \nBrown feet squelch through the mud, finally followed by dainty boots caked in dirt. The MAORI leaders of the party have stopped. \n4 - See Note \nBAINES works his way to the front. \nAUNT MORAG LIFT - YOUR - ARM - UP - DEAR. \nFLORA sits on the bed sulkily. She leans back and crosses her leg. \nFLORA My REAL father was a famous German composer \nAUNT MORAG Ohh the tag is broken. \nFLORA (continues) .... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg... \nThe two women pause to look at FLORA. ADA signs to FLORA \"THAT'S ENOUGH!\" \nFLORA Why? \nADA looks away, the two women finish primping the dress. FLORA crosses her arms. \nFLORA I want to be in the photograph. \nSc 22     EXT     STEWART'S Hut                DAY     Sc 22 \nNESSIE half holds an umbrella over ADA as they make their way to where the camera is setup in front of a chair and a sparse display of three toi-toi. All about the house is muddy, so much so that they must weave their way through on planks and logs. A fine veil of rain is falling across the distant bush, the whole valley is shrouded in mist. STEWART looks through the camera at the REVEREND and the photographer who are posing as the couple, complete with tatty bouquet. STEWART notices ADA's arrival and seeing her as a real bride, his bride, he is struckdumb with pride, even the rough tapes at the back or the dress cannot destroy the illusion. \nSTEWART Beautiful. \nThe umbrellas are held away, the rain pours down. \nSc 23     INT/EXT     STEWARTS HUT BEDROOM     DAY     Sc 23 \nAUNT MORAG has brought a chair into the bedroom and sits knee to knee with FLORA. \nAUNT MORAG I thought she met your father in Luxemburg. \nFLORA Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra. \nAUNT MORAG (frowning) And where did they get married? \nAUNT MORAG checks to see if someone is coming. \nFLORA (her Scottish accent becomes thick and expressive) In an enormous forest, with real fairies as bridesmaids each holding a little elf's hand. \nAUNT MORAG sits back, regarding FLORA with obvious disapproval and disappointment. She smooths back her hair. \nFLORA No, I tell a lie, it was in a small country church, near the mountains \nAUNT MORAG is becoming involved again. She leans forward. \nAUNT MORAG Which mountains are those dear? \nFLORA The Alps. \nAUNT MORAG Ohhh I've never been there. (she leans forward) \nFLORA Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys \nThat was before the accident.... \nAUNT MORAG Oh what happened? \nDown on the wet sand FLORA does a wild dance of her own invention using a seaweed wig. She finishes by rolling down the beach in the sand. \nBAINES views them with suspicion, yet he is magnetically drawn to the spectacle He has never seen women behave with so much abandon. His attention fixes on ADA's uninhibited emotional playing, and as he watches, he finds himself edging irresistibly closer. \nSc 30     EXT     BEACH                    LATE AFTER NOONSc 30 \nThe shadows are long on the sand when BAIN'ES collects the boards. ADA and FLORA are attempting a duet. ADA notices him come towards them with the boards, obviously intending that they should leave. Her mood darkens, she continues playing stubbornly even though FLORA has stopped. Abruptly she finishes. In black spirits she replaces her cape and bonnet. BAINES is struck by this sudden change, he watches her mesmerised as he replaces the boards. \nSc 31     EXT     BEACH                    NIGHT          Sc 31 \nFrom a helicopter, the camera tracks along the beach, following the crashing wave line, to find the piano. \nSCENE 32 DELETED \nSc 33     EXT     STEWART'S HUT & KITCHEN     DUSK          Sc 33 \nThe hut puffs smoke out into the valley. The lie of the land traps sound like a shell and the clear high notes of a voice echo out. Suspicious that ADA is singing, STEWART approaches the house quietly. Through the open kitchen door he sees that the keys of a piano have been etched on the table top. While ADA \"plays\" the notes FLORA sings them. \nSTEWART puts his pack down. ADA stands to attention, folding the tablecloth back over the table. \n5, 6 + 7 See notes \nSTEWART Hello, then. \nFLORA Hello. \nADA nods. STEWART'S hand explores the markings on the table. ADA watches his hand moving under the checked cloth. \nSc 34     INT     MISSION HOUSE               DAY     Sc 34 \nAUNT MORAG, NESSIE and TWO MAORI GIRLS dressed in proper Victorian costume are kneeling around a huge double white sheet, sewing and cutting it. The MAORI girls are part of the mission's good works. They are dressed in European style and while their training is in polite proper domestic behaviour they constantly corrupt it with their demonstrative displays of affection, and their clay tobacco pipes to which they are addicted. \nSTEWART is standing, looking on. BAINES is behind him in the kitchen removing his boots. \nAUNT MORAG (looking carefully at STEWART) Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done. (without pause but referring to the sheet) You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! (for NESSIE rather than to her) \nNESSIE It will be very dramatic. \nNESSIE leaves to get the tea. HENI, the MAORI girl with a Moku tickles MARI'S back while she sews. \nThey sing the anthem in snatches. It is background to the conversation. \nSTEWART (sitting down) What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano? \nAUNT MORAG Like it were a piano? \nSTEWART It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound. \nNESSIB puts STEWART'S tea down. BAINES comes in with his tea cup dwarfed in his big hands. He stands back leaning against a wall. \nAUNT MORAG (hissing to NESSIE) Biscuits.' No, no sound. \nNESSIE hustles back to the kitchen. \nSTEWART I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected. \nAUNT MORAG No sound at all? \nOut of his pocket he takes a carefully wrapped tuning fork. He unwraps the package, lifts the back and lid and starts to tune. He sniffs the air. BAINES watches, He sniffs close to the keys. \nScent? And salt of course. \nHe works on. \nWhat will you play when it's tuned? What music do you play? \nBAINS looks over at him from the meal he is preparing. \nBAINES I can't play. \nThe blind man stops working. \nBLIND MAN You don't play? \nBAINES No, I can't. \nI'm going to learn. \nThe man goes back to work somewhat depressed by the futility of the venture. \nBLIND MAN Well my dear Miss Broadbent, tuned, but silent. \nSCENE 44 DELETED SCENE 45 DELETED \nSC 46     EXT     BAINES' HUT                    MORNINGSc 46 \nA slash of sunlight falls across the piano. Thousands of particles of dust become visible floating in the air. BAINES is at the window in his shirt/night shirt. He notices the dust on the piano and strips off his shirt which he uses as a duster. Under the shirt he is naked. As he wipes the smooth wood he becomes aware of his nakedness. His movements become slower until he is no longer cleaning, but caressing the piano. \nSc 47     EXT     PATH TO BAINES'               DAY     Sc 47 \nOn the path to BAINES' house, ADA and FLORA sit in the bush. ADA's head is bowed. Her hands held over her face. FLORA tries to catch the spots of light in her palm as they twinkle through the thick canopy of leaves over head. \nSc 48     EXT/INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 48 \nThe door opens. ADA and FLORA stand in their cloaks and bonnets. \nFLORA Mother says she can't stand to teach piano with it all out or tune. So I'm to do scales. \nADA turns and walks off. FLORA bustles in. BAINES watches ADA from the window, \nFLORA I hope you've scrubbed your hands. \nFLORA begins a scale. \nOh, it's in tune. \nShe looks over at BAINES who is still gazing out the window. \nFLORA What's out there? \nShe gets up to see what BAINES is looking at. She sees her mother and divines BAINES is looking at nothing. \nFLORA You have to watch me where I put my fingers. \nFLORA starts again. ADA can only hear the piano faintly but moves closer as she too hears it's in tune. \nSc 51     INT     BAINE'S HUT                    DAY     Sc 51 \nADA's playing can be heard inside. BAINES sits back watching ADA. Her cape on the hook is dripping a puddle on to the floor and there is a circle of drips around her skirt hem. She is totally absorbed in her piano music as she was on the beach. \nBAINES watches. Her long white neck, now wet from rain, proves irresistible. He comes across the room and kisses her. ADA jumps up and prepares to leave. BAINES stands in front of the door. \nBAINES Do you know how to bargain, nod if you do. \nShe doesn't move, \nThere's a way you can have your piano back. Do you want it back? You want it back? \nADA eyes him suspiciously. \nBAINES You see I'd like us to make a deal. There's things I want to do while you stay. If you let me you can earn it back. \nWhat do you think, one visit for every key. \nADA is tense but she is thinking about it. She holds up a finger then points to the black of her dress. \nBAINES Your dress? \nADA shakes her head. \nSkirt ...? \nShe walks over to her piano and points to a black key. \nFor every black one? \nADA turns raising her head, nodding. \nThat's a lot less, half. \nBAINES is counting the keys. ADA starts for the front door. \nAll right, all right then, the black keys. \nShe sits back at the piano. She plays the lowest black key as in number one \nShe takes her hands off the piano waiting. \nIt's better that you play. \nObediently she begins, stopping abruptly, indignantly, as he touches her neck. \nBAINES Play... Keep playing. \nAfter a moment she settles back to the piano. \nSc 52     EXT     BAINES' VERANDAH               DAY     Sc 52 \nOutside FLORA is cradling the poor confused dog, asking him what cruel miserable person had sent him out into the cold and wet. \nSc 53     EXT     RIVERHOLE NEAR BAINES'          DAY     Sc 53 \nBAINES bathes in a riverhole. He is watched by a gathering of Maori, sometimes with great seriousness, at other times with hilarity. They pass between them his clothes, trying them on and mimicking him. One of the older women HIRA crouches close to the bank keeping up a steady line of inquiry. Her manner is relaxed but focused and persistent. She smokes a pipe- \nSc 56     INT     SCHOOL HALL                    DAY     Sc 56 \nFLORA stands on a kitchen chair. AUNT MORAG and NESSIE have paused from fitting FLORA's bodice and wire angel wings. They are attempting to learn the hand gestures as FLORA signs: \n\"I shall listen hard to rehearsal, because I live too far away to go often.\" \nAUNT MORAG (suspiciously) Which sign is the word rehearsal? \nFLORA deftly demonstrates. \nAUNT MORAG I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around. \nNESSIE To be deaf? \nAUNT MORAG Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!\"' \nFLORA Actually, to tell you the whole truth, Mama says most people speak rubbish and it's not worth the listen. \nAUNT MORAG and NESSIE exchange looks. \nAUNT MORAG (stiffly) Well, that is a strong opinion. \nFLORA Yes, it's unholy. \nSc 57     INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 57 \nADA is quick to remove a used plate and cup left on top of the piano. \nBAINES is sitting next to the window, his elbow on the sill, his head turned away. \nBAINES Lift your skirt, \nADA stops playing. She turns to him. Thinks about it then slowly lifts her skirt a little to show her boots. \nLift it higher. \nADA pulls the skirt up fractionally so the top other boots are exposed. \nBAINIES nods ADA starts to play again, not so confidently as before. \nBAINES moves close, he goes down on his knees to watch her feet on the pedals. \nBAINES Higher. \nADA doesn't hear. \nLift it higher. \nShe stops and lifts her skirt to her knees. She looks at BAINES with ill-disguised contempt. BAINES is enthralled with her legs, or what he can now see of them. He moves back to watch them from behind. He's lying on the ground, head propped on his arm. ADA's slim stockinged calves work the pedals, one of the stockings has a small hole through which her white skins shows \nSc 58     EXT      MISSION HOUSE GROUNDS          DUSK     Sc 58 \nHENI holds STEWART'S horse near a wooden gate. Its wet coat steams in he night air, making the whole horse glow. HENI talks softly to it in Maori. \nSc 59     INT     MISSION HOUSE               NIGHT     Sc 59 \nInside the REVEREND is closely watched by STEWART, AUNT MORAG and NESSIE as he cuts out the shape of an axe from a piece of marbled cardboard. A lamplight flickers warm tones across their faces while the rest of the room is dark giving it a conspiratorial air. \nSc 62     INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 62 \nBAINES secures a chair against the door while ADA is removing her dress top. She sits at the piano hugging herself against the chill. As BAINES passes be knocks the jacket off the chair back. He picks it up and takes it across to her seat by the window. \nBAINES nods and ADA begins to play. BAINES fingers the still warm jacket1 he lifts it up and smells it. ADA turns around and stops playing suddenly appalled by his odd sensual pleasure taking. She holds out her hand for the jacket, her expression stern and censorious. She indicates he should return it to the chair back. BAINES ignores her. ADA stands and comes over to BAINES. She pulls the jacket from his hands and replaces it across the chair back, but as she turns to sit, \nBAINES is beside her. He pulls the shoulders of her bodice down, exposing her shoulders and some of her breast. ADA immediately stands, but BMNES is much stronger and man-handles her across to the bed. ADA struggles seriously, this is much, much more than she was expecting. \nBAINES Ada, four keys. \nADA holds up five fingers and mouths 'five'. \nI just want to lie. \nADA shakes her head vigorously and again mouths five'. \nAll right, all right five. \nADA no longer struggles. She is stiff and still. BAINES intoxicated by the smell and presence of her skin becomes soft and gentle. He kisses and touches her with feeling and affection. Then suddenly aware of her stillness he too becomes still. He pulls himself up to see whether her face betrays her feelings. ADA seizes this opportunity to return to the uncertain sanctuary of her piano. From the bed, BAINES watches her run a hand noiselessly over the polished ivory keys, a gesture betraying affection never afforded to him. BAINES gets up. He shuts the piano lid forcing ADA to remove her hand. \nADA immediately stands and dresses, marking hurtfully BAINES' ownership of her piano. \nSc 63     EXT     STEWART'S HUT               SUNSETSc 63 \nA golden evening.

ADA automatically adjusts it for him, settling it around his neck. Her touch, meant practically, strangely affects him. In an impassioned impasse, meant gallantly, he tries to kiss ADA's finger tips. The gesture falters as ADA, surprised, jumps back. \nSc 65     EXT     SCHOOL HALL                    DUSK     Sc 65 \nPeople are arriving at the school hall.

One of the women is peeping through a hole in a make-shift curtain to watch the townspeople seating themselves. \nWOMAN They're bringing in extra seats! \nDespite this, there would still be only a maximum of forty people. 10 or so of them MAORIS in their best European dress. \nANOTHER WOMAN Oh God, don't pin my hair too high Alfred! \nSTILL ANOTHER Yes, me too, do it about here ...

BAINES intercepts her, stepping several times between her and the piano. She sees the game and stands still. He steps aside. She removes the plate, gently, lovingly wiping the surface underneath. There is a sulky irritation in the ways BAINES watches her. \nBAINES I have been waiting. You are very late. \nADA starts to play, BAINES watches then looks away. \nBAINES I don't want you to play. I just want you to sit. \nADA keeps playing until she has finished. Without looking at him she holds up two fingers against the piano. \nBAINES (angry) No, not two keys. \nADA starts playing again, BAINES feels powerless. He no longer admires her absorption with the piano, he is jealous of it. \nBAINES (shouts) Two keys then! \nShe stops playing. There is an insolence or casualness in the way she regards BAINES. He pulls her chair back from the piano. This upsets her, as much of her confidence was associated with the instrument. BAINES kisses her passionately on the mouth. ADA pulls back, BAINES persists, he is desperate and romantic. \nSc 72     EXT     BASE OF BUSH COVERED HILL     DAY     Sc 72 \nSTEWART, with BAINES interpreting, talks with a group of MAORIS at the base of a bush covered hill. The MAORIS sit behind a small representation of the hill marked out with twigs on the ground. The atmosphere is tense. \nMAORI NEGOTIATOR (pointing to the places) Nga awa kau kau, nga ana koiwi 0 matoti mattia tunpuna; kei runga katoa i te whenua nei korerongia atu ki to tangata na e Peini. (The bathing waters, the caves, that house, the remains of our ancestors are all part of this land. Explain it to the man Baines.)

Offer the blankets for half the land. \nSTEWART holds up his ten fingers and then two more. \nSTEWART T-w~e-l-v~e. \nBAINES Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci. (he'll give you twelve blankets for half the land.) UNSUBTITLED \nThe MAORIS look carefully at the quality of the blankets, noting the depth of the weave and the strength of the Wool. They shake their heads as they discuss them. \nFLORA is seen through BAINES' window Inside, ADA as ever charts her progress on the black keys, eleven. She turns to BAINES for instructions.  BAINES is not himself, he is sulky and distant. \nBAINES Do what you like. Play what you like. \nADA is perplexed by this turn about of behaviour. A little uncertainly, she sets about her playing. After a little she too turns to see what BAINES is doing. He's not there. She is surprised then anxious as she fears the deal may be off when there are flaw so few keys to go. She starts to play again, but her anxieties prove too great. She stops and listens. She looks out the window, where FLORA is mucking about in the yard. She walks to his bedroom, listens, then opens the door. BAINES stands naked looking at her. ADA is taken aback \nBAINES I want to lie together without clothes on. How many would that be? \nADA holds up ten fingers an impossibly high number of keys. \nBAINES nods. \nADA is surprised; she didn't expect him to agree. ADA checks again holding up her hands. \nBAINES Yes, ten keys. \nHesitantly, she starts to undress. She lies on her petticoat, having deemed the bed too dirty. BAINES lies, very still on top of her. A scraping sound is heard. \nSc 76     EXT/INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 76 \nFLORA is outside walking on sticks and logs trying to make sure she never puts her foot on the ground. She looks over at the house suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped again. She investigates the mystery peeping through the various cracks and holes in the loosely built hut. Her vision is always only parts of bodies, the venture is one of challenge and curiosity. \nSc 77     EXT     NATIVE PINE FOREST          DAY     Sc 77 \nFLORA and three small Maori children play amongst some native pines. Two MAORI WOMEN smoke and chat nearby. The children rub up and down against the tree trunks kissing and hugging them. The game has an edge of promiscuity to it as they exchange trunks and hug one tree as a group. Unseen by the children STEWART marches towards FLORA. He pulls her off the tree. \nSTEWART Never behave like that, never any where. You are greatly shamed and you have shamed those trunks.

The job has an increased futility as it has begun to rain- STEWART is inspecting her penance. She follows STPWART about the trees. \nFLORA (sulkily) I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano. \nSTEWART You've missed this bit. \nFLORA She never gives him a turn. \nSTEWART stops and looks at her. \nShe just plays whatever she pleases, sometimes she doesn't play at all. \nSTEWART continues through the trees more slowly. \nSTEWART And when is the next lesson? \nBAINES No. \nSTEWART And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay. \nBAINES No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it. \nSTEWART Well, I doubt I want it very much myself. \nBAINES It was more to your wife that I gave it. \nSTEWART Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it. \nHe closes the window. \nSo that is agreed on? \nBAINES nods. \nHIRA has wandered stiffly into BAINES' room. She sits on the edge of his bed. \nHIRA You make BIG mistake George. In first place you should swap land for wife. Now look, she gone, you no land, no music box, you got nothing. \nSCENE 86 DELETED \nSc87     EXT/INT     STEWART'S HUT     DAY     Sc 87 \nAt the door of the hut STEWART is distributing buttons to the piano bearers. One squats catching them as they fall. A commotion begins as one of the MAORIS snatches the whole jar and runs off. Two of them give chase while the others insist on tobacco. \n11 See Note \nInside the hut ADA had lifted the top of the piano and is peering in while playing notes to check tune and damage. \nSTEWART Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART. \nFLORA What will I play? \nShe looks to ADA, who looks back through her not concentrating. \nSTEWART Play a gig. \nFLORA (to ADA) Do I know any gigs? \nSTEWART Play a song then \nFLORA starts a song, ADA walks past them out of the hut, STEWART ignores her exit moving up to lean on the piano. ADA is seen through the hut window wandering amidst the ghostly, blackened trunks. STEWART'S attention is drawn to ADA, he interrupts FLORA'S singing with a sudden outburst. \nSTEWART (exasperated) Why won't she play it? We have it back, and she just wanders off! \nFLORA stops to watch her mother through the window. ADA looks towards the house as the music stops. \nSTEWART Keep playing! \nGrimly STEWART slaps the top of the piano to FLORA's playing. \nADA continues to walk, her face dark and puzzled. She stops. Her head stiffly, irresistibly, lifts and turns in the direction BAINES' hut. She peers deep into the bush as if attempting to penetrate a puzzle. She thinks and walks on. \nSc 88     INT     STEWART'S KITCHEN     DAY     Sc 88 \nInside BAINES' small bedroom the raw dark boards contrast with the softness, whiteness of BAINES' and ADA's bodies, The long black strands of ADA's hair stick to her cheek and wrap around her neck. Her face is flushed and her eyes are bright. BAINES rolls his face across her chest, gently, slowly savouring the flavour of her body. Drunkenly they continue their sex slowly, slowly. ADA's breaths turn to low murmurs; these small sounds are extraordinarily moving to BAINES whose face swoons with joy. \nBAINES What?  What?  whisper.... \nSc 93     INT     BAINES' BEDROOM&UNDER HOUSEDAYSc 93 \nAs ADA dresses, BAINES sits on his bed watching. He is unhappy, thoughtful. \nBAINES Now you are going I am miserable, why is that? (He catches her hand and draws her to hint) Ada I need to know, what will you do? Will you come again? \nADA is distracted, collecting her buttons from the floor, concerned at the time past, worried to dress and return. \nThe camera cranes down and down to find STEWART wedged under the loose wooden floor slats. He cannot hear clearly, but ADA's hand reaching for each button is only inches away. One falls through a slat on to STEWART'S neck and on down his shirt collar. As she stands he rolls out. \nBAINES Wait! I don't know what you're thinking. (gently, teasingly) Does this mean something to you? Hey? (Stroking a strand of hair behind her ear) I already miss you. Ada, do you love me? \nADA considers this question. Clearly she doesn't know, the question is more complex to her than to him, then as if by way of answer she kisses him strongly and sexually. BAINES pulls away confused. ADA finishes dressing. BAINES comes up behind her to help with the buttons. \nBAINES (anxiously) Come tomorrow. If you are serious, come tomorrow. \nADA turns and kisses him passionately, with the new born enthusiasm of someone who has just discovered their appetite for sex. Then as quickly as she began, she takes her hood and cape and goes to leave. \nBAINES Tomorrow? \nShe nods and is gone. \nSc 94     INT     STEWART'S HUT ADA'S BEDROOMNIGHTSc 94 \nFLORA and ADA are both in their white nightgowns. FLORA stands behind ADA on a chair trying to sort out the knots that have matted at the back of ADA's head. ADA shakes her head from side to side playfully, making the difficult job impossible. \nFLORA Stay still! It's the very worst knots. \nFLORA tries to hold her mother's head still but ADA's high spirits are unstoppable and her hair flies out from side to side flicking FLORA in the face. \nFLORA Mama STOP IT! \nFLORA starts to giggle and retaliates flinging her own hair from side to side. The two women are twirling in the small bedroom their hair flying about them, FLORA is shrieking with the fun, then stops dizzy and sick. ADA continues flicking FLORA as she twirls. \nFLORA Stop it I feel sick! \nBut ADA doesn't stop, her dark hair whirls about her, as giddy and disorientated, she knocks against the walls \nSc 95     INT     STEWART'S HUT     NIGHT     Sc 95 \nNext door STEWART sits on his bed listening, his hair wet and neatly combed. He has a journal of pressed botanical specimens beside him. Hearing FLORA squealing he goes to the kitchen and standing back in the shadows, watches ADA frenetic, whirling through the part open door.

The sky is dark and the wind is ballooning ADA's cape, wrapping it up high around her. The tree tops are swaying furiously. Inside the bush it is dark and ADA hurries up through the path. She is out or breath and glancing behind her as if to guard against followers, when directly in front of her STEWART steps out onto her path. ADA stops short. The look on his face is unlike any expression she has yet seen. His eyes do not look at her, but all about her in a way more animal than human. She lowers her eyes and calling his bluff walks steadily past him. But STEWART takes her arm and spinning her back, pulls her close and blind to all protest kisses her. ADA struggles furiously. His grip falters and she steps back staring at him, then runs off down the hill, but STEWART is on top of her clasping her skirts, pulling her towards him hand over hand, she slips and falls to the ground. STEWART is upon her, lifting her dress, touching her legs, ADA goes quite still, which throws STEWART long enough for her to scramble away, yet again STEWART catches her and again they roll on the ground, STEWART touching and kissing her, ADA turning herself this way and that to avoid it. There is a cat and mouse quality to their mute struggle finally broken by FLORA calling up the path, distraught and in tears, her angel wings have twisted about her waist. \nFLORA (TOP OF HER LUNGS) Mumma! Mumma! They are playing your piano! \nSTEWART allows ADA to get up and the two women go back down the path towards home. The distant sound of the piano keys thumping. \nSc 98     INT     STEWART'S HUT     DAY     Sc 98 \nSTEWART Ada! \nBut ADA scowls and pulls away roughly, STEWART lies back anxious not to break the spell and when he is still ADA continues to caress his chest. His eyes well with tears and he looks up into her face like a child after a bad dream, fearful and trusting. ADA continues like a nurse spreading ointment on a wound, tenderly and attentively she strokes down towards his belly. STEWART'S skin goose bumps and be shudders. He puts his hand on hers to still it1 she slides hers out and continues stroking. He looks at her pleadingly and childlike, she stops and kisses the soft skin of his belly, STEWART groans clutching the mattress. ADA seems removed from STEWART as if she has a separate curiosity of her own. \nSc 105INT     STEWART'S KITCHEN          DAY     Sc 105 \nNext day AUNT MORAG stands circling in STEWART'S small darkened house. FLORA and ADA sit quietly together \nAUNT MORAG Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave. \nNESSIE Yes, like a cave. \nAUNT MORAG Ohh no, it makes my skin creep! \nSTEWART comes into the house with some logs, AUNT MORAG follows him across to the fire. \nAUNT MORAG Alisdair, is it because of our play? Have the natives aggressed you? \nShe continues following him to the door. \nI have to say you have done the wrong thing here, you see you have put the latch on the outside. When you close the door, (and she doses it) it will be the Macna that lock you in, you see? With the latch on that side you are quite trapped. \nNESSIE (nodding her head in imitation) ... you are quite trapped. \nAUNT MORAG walks inside and continues to the table where her basket full of clothes and packets of food have been left. She lifts it from the table and begins to spread the cloth. \nAUNT MORAG We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners. \nNESSIE (in unison) ... without a shred of manners. \nNESSIE and AUNT MORAG are unpacking parcels of cakes and biscuits on plates putting them about the table. \nAUNT MORAG He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone. \nSTEWART Baines is packing up? \nAUNT MORAG Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears \nAt this mention NESSlE's face crumples and tears again begin to flow. \nAUNT MORAG (very firmly) STOP IT! STOP! \nNESSIE remarkably obeys, blinking her face back to shape. \nADA attempts to disguise her agitation, she moves to the piano and strokes it, she begins to play. \nI am quite frightened of the way back, we must leave in good light. Will we be safe? \nSTEWART (wanting them gone) If you leave soon, yes, I am sure of it. \nSTEWART and MORAG watch ADA at the piano. Her playing develops until she is fully absorbed.

The girls have long, stained, once white pinafores and everyone wears boots that seem too big, except the little boy who has the front cut off his hoots so his toes can hang out. \nFour little girls play a sedate game of skip rope, using a bush vine.

There was no sound, but I beard it here (he presses his forehead with a palm of his hand). Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice. \nBAINES (trying to understand) Spoken words? \nSTEWART No, but her words are in my head. (he looks at BAINES and pauses) I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words. \nBAINES (suspiciously) What are they? \nSTEWART looks up at the ceiling as if reciting something he has learnt by heart and means to repeat exactly as he heard it. \nSTEWART She said, \"I have to go, let me go, let Baines take me away, let him try and save me. I am frightened of my will, of what it might do it is so strange and strong\". \nBAINES recovering himself eyes STEWART angrily. \nBAINES You punished her wrongly, it was me, my fault. \nSTEWART does not answer. Finally be looks up, his eyes full with tears. \nSTEWART Understand me. I am here for her, for her I wonder that I don't wake, that I am not asleep to be here talking with you. I love her. But what is the use? She doesn't care for me. I wish her gone. I wish you gone. I want to wake and find it was a dream, that is what I want. I want to believe I am not this man.

She puts her hand into the sea and moves it back and forth. \nThe piano is carefully lowered and with a heave topples over. As the piano splashes into the sea, the loose ropes speed their way after it.

They are scars and hardened skin. \nADA and FLORA do not move. Humiliated BAINES takes a scrub brush, soap and bucket and goes outside. ADA can see him from the window. She moves to her piano. She wants to touch it but she is torn by her feelings, wanting it, but not owning it. She strokes the varnished wood with her hand and softly lifts the lid. Outside FLORA stands beside BAINES pointing out hits of his hand he should still scrub. Furtively she lays her hands on the keys. The instrument is horribly out of tune, almost every note is off. She goes outside and signs to FLORA. \nFLORA There's no tune left in the piano so she can't teach you. \nThe two women leave. \nSc40     EXT      STEEP BUSH HILL                DAY     Sc40 \nTwo men come crashing out down a steep bush hill, They are tied to each other. BAINES, the younger and stronger, is trying to break their fall by grasping hold of branches and shoots. Finally their fall is checked. The old man is white haired, the front of his suit splattered with the debris of many meals. He sits up feeling about for his glasses. He is blind. His eyes, though closed, wobble and roll BAINES finds the glasses One of the lenses has gone, the other is very dark.

He is watched by MANA and his friend who squat passing a pipe between themselves. MANA strums tirelessly on his buttons. \nFLORA Mumma wanted me to give this to Mr. Baines. \nShe holds out the cotton covered piano key. STEWART looks up. \nI thought maybe it was not a proper thing to do. \nSTEWART keeps working, hammering the post into the earth. \nShall I open it? \nSTEWART No!! \nHe stops and takes the key, suspicious and uncomfortable. He slowly unwraps it and turning it over reads it. Squeezing the key in his fist, STEWART staggers off in a daze, He returns, picks up his open pack spilling the nails. Finally he drops the pack and the key) and leaves with only his axe. FLORA follows confused. The MAORIS waste no time investigating the booty.

ADA pushes her chair back. \nSTEWART (exasperated) why? WHY? I trusted you! \nHe pulls the axe out of the table and swings it at the piano. \nWHY? \nADA runs forward to restrain him, but it sinks deep into the wood.

Speak or not you shall answer for it! \nHe drags her out through the mud, towards the wood chop. It is raining hard. \nADA sees where they are headed and suddenly she is very scared. She bucks and struggles, but STEWART is infinitely stronger. At the wood chop she breaks free and crawls away through the woodchips and mud. But axe in hand he grasps her by the neck of her dregs, then her hair, and pulls her backwards towards the cutting block. There, he takes her right hand and holds it in place with his boot, so that only ADA's index finger shows, ADA's head is held twisted between the wood chop and STEWART'S leg. \nSTEWART (anguished) Do you love him? Do you?! Is it him you love? \nADA blinks rigid with fear. The rain is driving down. \nFLORA No, she says NOOOOOO!!! \nThe axe falls. ADA's face buckles in pain. Blood squirts onto FLORA's white pinafore, her angel wings are splattered in mud. \nFLORA (Screaming) Mother!! \nADA stands. She looks faint, her finger is pulsing blood, she shakes her hand then seeing the blood she puts it behind her back shocked. She watches FLORA, concerned and confused. Uncontrollably her whole body starts to shake and as if by reflex ADA begins to walk. FLORA trots parallel to her. \nFLORA Mama! \nADA keeps walking blindly like her being depends on it. Her face is ashen, her eyes fearful as she walks unseeingly straight into a large tree stump. She sinks into the mud. \nSTEWART wraps the finger in a white handkerchief and gives it to FLORA who backs away from him terrified. \nFLORA (quietly) Mama. \nSTEWART Take this to Baines.

Some hold mats over their heads to protect themselves from the rain, one has a battered umbrella. \nHIRA They wrong Peini. We need guns to hold it. \nBAINES mounts his heavily laden horse.

Through all this BAINES keeps his bead down shaking it in disbelief and shy happiness. He starts to laugh with relief and pleasure. The little girls think it is something funny in the line and continue to repeat it, which each then appears to give BAINES fresh pleasure.

Hush, hush, what is it? \nFLORA thrusts the wrapped finger at BAINES. He takes the blood soaked object and unwraps it. The finger unravels into his hand, he reels back groaning, choking about to be sick. \nFLORA (yelling) He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up! \nBAINES (angry, horrified) What happened? \nBut FLORA cannot speak.

I clipped your wing, that is all. \nSTEWART sings two lines of an English love ballad to ADA. \nSTEWART We shall be together, you will see it will be better... \nHer forehead is damp with fever. She thrashes at the blankets. STEWART pulls them off to cool her. He feels her brow. \nSTEWART (whispering) ... my love bird. \nHer nightgown is damp with sweat and clings to her body. STEWART reaches out to adjust her gown, his hand touches her leg and he holds it there, feeling a tingle of pleasure, that grows and builds the longer his hand remains. \nSTEWART Ohhhhh my love \nHis hand begins to move further and further up her leg, nudging the nightgown higher and higher. He looks at her face. She is closed-eyed, unconscious. STEWART'S face crinkles into a pained expression and all his control melts into a drive to hold and extend this moment. He brings his mouth to her leg and begins to kiss her knee, her thigh. A new thought occurs to him, a terrible thought, but as he has phrased the thought to himself, he cannot resist it. He glances at her face still fevered and unconscious. Quietly, stealthily, he begins to undo his belt buckle. He bends across her to gently separate her legs. As he moves his body over her, he looks towards her and to his shame and horror she is looking directly back at him, her eyes perfectly on his, perfectly focused. Quietly STEWART moves back and pulls down her gown, all the time keeping his eyes on her. \nSTEWART You are feeling better? \nADA's lips move slightly and STEWART turns suddenly as if he has heard something. Slowly he turns back to ADA. \nSTEWART looks at ADA intently, moving closer to her bed, closer to ADA his eyes locked on hers. \nSTEWART What...? \nThe sound of his own voice makes him blink. He watches her as if listening to her speak in a voice that is so faint, and distant, that only with great concentration and perseverance can he make it out. As he watches her his face transforms; his eyes fill, his lips soften and his eyebrows take on the exact expression of her own. \nThe kerosene lamp burns fitfully, fluttering a light pulse across their faces. STEWART moves closer to ADA. Outside a wind bangs the iron roof and rubs branches against each other making a high-pitched see-saw sound. He leans closer still. \nSc 134EXT     STEWARTS     NIGHT     Sc 134 \nSTEWART carrying a candle in a glass box makes his way through ghostly tree stumps.

STEWART sits near the bed on a box, resting his gun across his knee, his face is glowing, he looks closely at BAINES, examining him. \nSTEWART I look at you, at your face. I have had that face in my head hating it. But now I am here seeing it ... it's nothing, you blink, you have your mark, you look at me through your eyes, yes. you are even scared of me \nSTEWART laughs. \nSTEWART Look at you! \nBAINES watches him stiffly, disconcerted, unable to read STEWART'S strange mood.

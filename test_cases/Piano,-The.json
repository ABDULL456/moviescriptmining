ADA and FLORA shelter inside their make-shift tent, a hooped petticoat secured at the edges with stones.  Inside the tent a candle lights up their conversation. \nADA is hand signaling a story to FLORA who lies back watching, nervous and afraid. ADA's whole self is involved in the \"telling\", her face is alight with expression, now tender, now sad, now humorous, now soft, while her hands and fingers are deft and precise. From outside it is an odd shadow play. \nFLORA (hand signaling) Mother... I'm thinking \nADA pauses. \n(speaking) I'm not going to call him Papa.  I'm not going to call HIM anything. I'm not even going to look at HIM. \nSc 15     EXT     BUSH ON WAY TO BEACH          DAY     Sc 15 \nThrough a dense bush walk a party of fourteen MAORI people and two EUROPEAN MEN. The wetness, closeness and darkness of the bush is such that the air seems green, like at the bottom of a deep sea. Two of the MAORIS share one pair of shoes and all of them are clothed in a mixture of native and European costume. Of the Europeans one is small and has a shy manner. He has a half completed Maori tattoo across his cheeks. The other is a similar age about 45 and wears a suit, muddy and out of place here in the bush. He staggers, spurts forward then slows to a stop. His hair and face are wet and his skin reflects the green foliage. BAINES the younger man turns and slows. \nBAINES Are we stopping?... Do you want to stop? \nThe MAORI voices and laughter are becoming fainter. BAINES watches torn between his concern for STEWART and the split in their party. \n3-See Notes \nBAINES Shall we stop? \nUnable to get an answer BAINES runs after the MAORIS. \nBAINES Tai hoa! Me tatari tatou .., me tutatou I konei. (Wait! We are stopping.. we're stopping.) SUBTITLED \nSTEWART takes out a comb and drags it dazed and zombie like through his wet hair. Inside the darkness of his pocket, he turns over and over a small, worn edged photograph, a smudge of green light allows us to see ADA's tumbling face. Taking it in the heel of his hand he secretly looks at it. Just as the party return and settle he stares on ahead possessed and determined. \nSTEWART We must get on. \nThe MAORIS look at BAINES bewildered. \nTAME Aue tepatupsiarehe! (The fairy people, what can you expect?) SUBTITLED \nSc 16     EXT     BEACH                     MORNINGSc 16 \nIt is early morning. The sea is calmer and the tide is again low. The party or two EUROPEANS and fourteen MAORI MEN and WOMEN come out on to the beach. About half the MAORI party head straight for the shoreline where an older woman loudly organises a pipi collection. All sorts of containers are used from flax baskets to shirts with knots in their arms. The rest follow STEWART and BAINES over to the boxes. STEWART automatically re-combs his hair, patting it against his forehead, where it sticks in a raked pattern. On his head he carefully places a formal top hat, oddly dean compared to his mud splattered suit. The party stops short of the petticoats where a tell-tale foot reveals its occupants. \nSTEWART Miss McGrath, Alisdair Stewart. You'll have to wake yourself. I've got men here to carry your things. \nADA and FLORA struggle up to find themselves confronted by a group of men and women. The MAORIS stare curiously and comment on the women. \nAut he anahera enci? (Are they angels, they look like angels.) SUBTITLED \nA man points at FLORA's feet and gestures as if holding one of the little shoes in his hand. \nTe monohi hoki! (So small!) SUBTITLED \nFLORA is struck by shyness and hides under her mother's skirt. ADA cannot look straight at STEWART and STEWART also cannot look at her. \nSTEWART I see you have a good many boxes, I'd like to know what is in each. \nAs ADA does not move STEWART is puzzled. \nSTEWART CAN - YOU - HEAR - ME? \n", "test1_true": "STEWART Well that is good, yes that is good, good. \nSTEWART smiling searches ADA's face for some sign of comprehension but is unnerved by her lack of response. He stops smiling, and, patting his hair walks to the closest box. Several of the MAORI party follow behind STEWART while one of them closely and particularly mimics him. \nSTEWART What's in here? \nADA points to the writing already on the box saying \"Crockery and Pots\". \nSTEWART Ohh, yes so it is, written there, crockery. \nSTEWART And this one? \nADA writes \"bedclothes and linen\" on the pad around her neck- While she writes he takes the opportunity to scrutinise her. \nSTEWART You're small. I never thought you'd be small. \nHe walks to another chest \nSTEWART What's here? \nShe writes \"clothes\". The MAORI mimic also pretends to write. \nFinally he comes to the piano box. He lifts a corner experimentally. \nSTEWART What's in here then, lead? \nFLORA (gravely) It's my mother's piano. \nSTEWART A piano? \nThe MAORIS touch the exposed legs of the piano.  STEWART speaks to the other European man BAINES. \nSTEWART Tell them to carry in pairs. \nThose three and those two the black and the red, then the suitcases. \nSTEWART holds BAINES back a moment. \nSTEWART What do you think? \nSTEWART nods towards ADA. BAINES thinks a moment then turns towards ADA too. \nBAINES She looks tired. \nSTEWART She's stunted, that's one thing. \nBAINES walks over to HONE a big man and the MAORJ leader, he stands tall with a great sense of his own importance. (Mana) \nBAINES Anei nga pouaka - ko era e toro. Me era e raa. (Here are the boxes, those three and those two.) UNSUBTITLED \nHONE E Hoal \nHONE takes an aggressive fighting posture towards BAINES, insulted that BAINES should suggest he might carry anything. HONE does not carrying, he is the boss. With great dignity HONE retreats, too injured to help. Other MAORIS come up and BAINES assigns them boxes. ADA gets worried, the piano is being left alone. She writes on her pad, \"THE PIANO?\" She shows STEWART. \nSTEWART Oh no, it can't come now. \nFLORA It must come. \n", "test1_id": 132, "test2_input": "NIHE (Amused by them) E te whsnau keite pai-he takaro tenei.

BAINES intercepts her, stepping several times between her and the piano. She sees the game and stands still. He steps aside. She removes the plate, gently, lovingly wiping the surface underneath. There is a sulky irritation in the ways BAINES watches her. \nBAINES I have been waiting. You are very late. \nADA starts to play, BAINES watches then looks away. \nBAINES I don't want you to play. I just want you to sit. \nADA keeps playing until she has finished. Without looking at him she holds up two fingers against the piano. \nBAINES (angry) No, not two keys. \nADA starts playing again, BAINES feels powerless. He no longer admires her absorption with the piano, he is jealous of it. \nBAINES (shouts) Two keys then! \nShe stops playing. There is an insolence or casualness in the way she regards BAINES. He pulls her chair back from the piano. This upsets her, as much of her confidence was associated with the instrument. BAINES kisses her passionately on the mouth. ADA pulls back, BAINES persists, he is desperate and romantic. \nSc 72     EXT     BASE OF BUSH COVERED HILL     DAY     Sc 72 \nSTEWART, with BAINES interpreting, talks with a group of MAORIS at the base of a bush covered hill. The MAORIS sit behind a small representation of the hill marked out with twigs on the ground. The atmosphere is tense. \nMAORI NEGOTIATOR (pointing to the places) Nga awa kau kau, nga ana koiwi 0 matoti mattia tunpuna; kei runga katoa i te whenua nei korerongia atu ki to tangata na e Peini.

STEWART laden down with his blankets, red-faced and irritable. \nSTEWART What do they want it for? They don't cultivate it, burn it back, anything. How do they even know it's theirs? \nBAINES stops as he comes to a freshly placed fence post. STEWART winds down his complaints watching BAINES anxiously. BAIXES walks down to the next one. he touches the freshly split post. \n(tentatively) I thought I might as well mark it out. \nBAINES Yes, why not. \nSTEWART Ada says you're doing well with the piano? \nBAINES keeps walking from post to post. \nSTEWART I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play. \nBAINES Nothing just yet \nSTEWART No. Well I suppose it takes time. \nSc 74EXT     STEWARTS VEGETABLE PATCHDAYSc 74 \nADA has cut a good sized cabbage in the vegetable patch. She throws it to FLORA who misses, dropping it in a pool of mud, spattering her face and dress. ADA smiles and FLORA who was about to cry gives the cabbage a big football beet towards her mother. ADA's mouth falls open, but then she too kicks it and they begin to dribble the mud caked cabbage towards the hut, all the time signing playful insults. Into this arrives STEWART. \nSTEWART Baines can't play a damn thing. Is that right he can't play a thing? \nWe're going to lose that land, the way he was carrying on over it. \nIs he musical? You've got to teach him a song. Something simple. \nFLORA has her foot on the cabbage, she nudges it off behind her. It roll down the hill.

Her face grimaces and she groans. \nSTEWART I meant to love you. I clipped your wing, that is all. \nSTEWART sings two lines of an English love ballad to ADA. \nSTEWART We shall be together, you will see it will be better... \nHer forehead is damp with fever. She thrashes at the blankets. STEWART pulls them off to cool her. He feels her brow. \nSTEWART (whispering) ... my love bird. \nHer nightgown is damp with sweat and clings to her body. STEWART reaches out to adjust her gown, his hand touches her leg and he holds it there, feeling a tingle of pleasure, that grows and builds the longer his hand remains. \nSTEWART Ohhhhh my love \nHis hand begins to move further and further up her leg, nudging the nightgown higher and higher. He looks at her face. She is closed-eyed, unconscious. STEWART'S face crinkles into a pained expression and all his control melts into a drive to hold and extend this moment. He brings his mouth to her leg and begins to kiss her knee, her thigh. A new thought occurs to him, a terrible thought, but as he has phrased the thought to himself, he cannot resist it. He glances at her face still fevered and unconscious. Quietly, stealthily, he begins to undo his belt buckle. He bends across her to gently separate her legs. As he moves his body over her, he looks towards her and to his shame and horror she is looking directly back at him, her eyes perfectly on his, perfectly focused. Quietly STEWART moves back and pulls down her gown, all the time keeping his eyes on her. \nSTEWART You are feeling better? \nADA's lips move slightly and STEWART turns suddenly as if he has heard something. Slowly he turns back to ADA. \nSTEWART looks at ADA intently, moving closer to her bed, closer to ADA his eyes locked on hers. \nSTEWART What...? \nThe sound of his own voice makes him blink. He watches her as if listening to her speak in a voice that is so faint, and distant, that only with great concentration and perseverance can he make it out. As he watches her his face transforms; his eyes fill, his lips soften and his eyebrows take on the exact expression of her own. \nThe kerosene lamp burns fitfully, fluttering a light pulse across their faces.

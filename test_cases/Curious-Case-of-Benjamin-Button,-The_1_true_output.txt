Caressing her... 
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Of someone you love... 
267   INT. BENJAMIN'S HOTEL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980           267 
We see Benjamin standing at the window watching as Daisy gets into a taxi... the taxi starting to drive off... and Daisy turning... to look back... waving to him. Benjamin waving to her... what they both somehow know, is a last goodbye... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) I watched her go... 
..and as the taxi drives away... 
(CONTINUED) 
267   CONTINUED:                                                     267 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) Until she went out of sight... 
...the taxi going down the street and out of sight... for the last time... Despite losing sight of her he still hasn't moved... standing by the window... 
268   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT             268 
Daisy, breath raspy, sitting silently in her bed looking out the window... We realize Caroline's stopped reading... 
DAISY Please read... 
CAROLINE That's the last thing he wrote... 
Daisy's quiet... they both are... alone with their thoughts... 
CAROLINE (CONT'D) What happened to him after that last time with you, Mother? 
The wind has picked up considerably, rattling the window even harder.. 
DAISY A year or so after your father passed... There was a call... 
269   INT. DAISY'S HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - LATE DAY, 1990               269 
And we see Daisy in her bathrobe, in her sixties... drinking a cup of coffee... the telephone rings... 
(CONTINUED) 
269   CONTINUED:                                                      269 
DAISY Hello?... Yes?... Speaking -- I don't understand? Where was that? 
270   INT. A TAXI, NEW ORLEANS - LATE DAY, 1990                       270 
We see Daisy riding in the back or a taxi. 
DAISY It's the last house... 
She looks outside, and we see up ahead of her, the Nolan House standing like a monument to time... 
271   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE - DAY, 1990                             271 
Daisy gets out. The taxi drives off. Daisy stops for a moment before she opens the gate. The house has fallen into disrepair. A solitary old man sits on the porch rocking and rocking. She goes up the walk and out of habit goes around the back porch... to the kitchen... going inside... 
272   INT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE DAY, 1990                               272 
She comes into the kitchen. She moves down the hallway into the living room... The interior has also fallen on hard times. Some old people are still in residence -- predominantly African Americans now... Queenie's daughter, now in her fifties herself, stands in the living room... Along with a plain Man in a plain suit... 
DAISY I'm Daisy... 
The Man turns... 
THE MAN Thank you for coming... I'm David Hernandez with the Orleans Parish department of Child Welfare Services. 
Queenie's daughter turns on a lamp... it doesn't work... she crosses the room to turn on another... 
THE MAN (CONT'D) He was found living in a condemned building off of east Lamont... the police found this with him... this address... and your name... 
And he gives her the journal... 
(CONTINUED) 
272   CONTINUED:                                                      272 
THE MAN (CONT'D) He was in very poor health... he was taken to the hospital... He doesn't seem to know who or where he is... He's very confused... The doctors who looked at him think he may be autistic. 
QUEENIE'S DAUGHTER I told Mr. Hernandez about Benjamin bein' one of us. I told him if he needs a place to stay... it's alright... he can stay here... he is blood after all... 
And just then we hear a PIANO playing... as if it were being played by a child... with no skill... banging as much as anything... And Daisy follows the sound of the piano into the parlor... 
273   INT. PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - DAY, 1990                            273 
And she sees his back... just a boy of 12 now... hunched over... trying to play the piano... trying to play the tune the woman had taught to him... 
DAISY Benjamin. 
He turns at the sound of her voice. There is no indication he recognizes her at all. 
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE Do you know this song? 
And he tries to play what he thinks is the song, but is nothing more than a child playing random notes. 
DAISY You play really beautifully. 
She comes and touches his back... He shrinks from her touch. 
THE MAN He doesn't seem to like to be touched. 
And while he tries to play... 
(CONTINUED) 
273   CONTINUED:                                                      273 
THE MAN (CONT'D) The doctors said if they didn't know any better, he goes in and out of states of recognition, as if he had the beginnings of dementia... 
Daisy's looking at the boy, who was once the man she loved... who she still loves... She looks into his eyes... 
DAISY Do you remember me?   I'm Daisy. 
He looks at her.    No sense of recognition. 
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE Daisy is a very pretty name. I'm Benjamin. 
DAISY It's good to meet you Benjamin. Do you mind if I sit with you? I would love to hear you play. 
He doesn't say anything. She sits down beside him on the piano bench. He stops to look at her. 
BENJAMIN AT TWELVE There's something about you... There's something about your eyes I remember from a long time ago... 
He looks at her eyes. She looks at him... And as she sits with him on the piano bench... as he tries to play... Daisy and Benjamin, "together again..." 
274   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              274 
DAISY Queenie's daughter saw to it that he was taken care of... 
275   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1994                   275 
And we see Benjamin, just eight now... coming into the kitchen... Queenie's daughter cleaning up after breakfast. 
BENJAMIN AT EIGHT I want some breakfast. 
(CONTINUED) 
275   CONTINUED:                                                       275

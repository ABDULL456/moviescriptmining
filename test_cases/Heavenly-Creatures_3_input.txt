CUT TO: 
INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S SLEEPOUT - NIGHTPauline is lying in bed asleep. Her door opens and John stands tentatively in the door way. He is wearing stripey pyjamas. 
JOHN (Loud whisper) Yvonne! 
Pauline sits up, groggily flicking on a bedside light. 
PAULINE Whaddya want? 
John puts his fingers to his lips to shush her. 
JOHN (Whispers) l can't sleep . . . can l borrow a book? 
PAULINE (Whispers) Shut the door. 
John tiptoes across to the bookshelf He pulls a book out . . . "Girls' Own Annual 1951." 
JOHN This looks interesting. 
Pauline gives him a dubious look from her bed. 
John stands shivering, flicking through the annual. 
JOHN These knitting patterns look damn complicated. Have you tried the tea cosy? 
Pauline shakes her head and looks on as John continues to thumb awkwardly through the book, his shivers increasing. 
He glances at Pauline nervously. 
JOHN It's damn cold, isn't it? Do you think I could hop into bed for a moment . . . just to warm up? My feet are like iceblocks. 
PAULINE You should have worn your slippers. 
JOHN Come on, Yvonne, I'll catch me death! 
Pauline rolls to one side. 
PAULINE Just for a minute. 
John climbs into bed beside Pauline and pulls the blankets up around his chin. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RIEPERS' HOUSE - NIGHTMidnight at 31 Gloucester St. All the lights are off. 
PAULINE (Diary V.O.) To think that so much could happen in so little time, caused by so few. A terrible tragedy has occurred . . . 
INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE/PAULINE'S SLEEPOUT - NIGHTPauline is lying in bed. The lights are off. 
PAULINE (Theatrical voice) "Now, gels . . . it isn't ooo, it's eee," and she goes . . . "eeeeee" as if someone is jabbing a pin into her! Silly old trout! 
PULL OUT during Pauline's V.O.... to reveal John lying in bed beside her. He cuddles up to her. 
JOHN I love you, Yvonne. 
Pauline continues, oblivious to his attentions. 
PAULINE And then in history, we've got this senile old bat, who goes . . . (Squawky voice) "And Charles the Second met Nell Gwynn aboard a boat and he was a prince and she was a pretty young thing and these thing do happen . . ." (Normal voice) God! It's no wonder I don't excel in history! 
JOHN Do you love me as much as I love you? 
PAULINE 0f course, my darling Nicholas. 
John can't contain himself . . . he starts pressing himself against her body. 
JOHN (Panting) My . . . my name's John. 
Pauline lies on her back, not responding to his caresses. 
PAULINE I like Nicholas much better! 
John climbs on top of Pauline. 
JOHN You can call me anything you like . . . 
John fumbles around beneath the sheets. 
PAULINE What are you doing? 
JOHN Nothing . . .

RATSO What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ! 
JOE Who? 
RATSO I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how should I know? 
Ratso is trembling so violently that the sou, starts to slop over. Joe takes it and sets it on the table. 
JOE Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what. 
RATSO No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor. 
JOE Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me? 
RATSO I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance. 
JOE You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida? 
RATSO I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask. 
JOE Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this. 
RATSO I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable. 
Joe sets his Stetson on his head. 
JOE When I put you on that bus down to Florida tonight, that'll be the happiest day of my life! 
INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY 
Joe strikes a match with his thumbnail and watches it curl away while he waits, hearing a phone ring. Then the phone is answered by a woman's voice. 
JOE Hey, Shirley... Miss who? Oh, yeah, well, when will Missus Gardner be home? ... I'm a friend of hers, a goddam good friend... Shee-it, I can't wait till then... 
Joe hangs up while the answering service's voice is still talking. The match has burned out. Joe flips it away. 
INSERT 
Headline -- WALTER P. BOX TAKES NEW YORK BY SURPRISE. 
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DUSK 
Joe loiters outside a gag headline print shop, his eyes following a man in homburg and chesterfield. 
EXT./INT. METROPOLE - DUSK 
Joe lingers momentarily, identifying with the violence in a jazz drummer, his eyes searching for a pickup. 
INT. ARCADE - DUSK 
Joe tests his skills in a shoot-down with a large metal cowboy and kills him, a recorded voice sneaks, "Got me!" as the cowboy slumps. Joe glances off as he hears polite applause... 
TOWNY'S VOICE Bravo... 
... TOWNY -- a stout, round-faced man -- clasps Joe's hand between both of his own, like an old friend. 
TOWNY How are you? (more quietly) Townsend P. Locke, from Chicago. Call me Towny. I'm here to attend a paper manufacturers' convention and, frankly, to have a little fun, dammit... 
Towny grips Joe's elbow, almost forcibly leading him away. 
EXT. SIDE STREET WEST OF BROADWAY - DUSK 
Towny's face appears huge at Joe's shoulder. 
TOWNY This is my first night in town and I'll consider it a ghastly omen clouding my entire ten days, if you don't consent to have dinner with me. Anywhere you like...

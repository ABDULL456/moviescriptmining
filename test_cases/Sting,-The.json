{"test1_input": "GONDORFF Did he say he wouldn't? \nHOOKER No. \nGONDORFF (softly) He'll show. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nTHE TALE \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nWE OPEN ON A WIDE SHOT OF THE ALLEY OUTSIDE THE STORE \nAt first it appears to be deserted, but we move to reveal a figure in an upper window of the apartment building which forms one side of the alley.  It's Kid Twist.  His eyes roam the street, for what, we do not yet know. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AN OLD DRUGSTORE ACROSS FROM THE ALLEY - DAY \nProbably prosperous at one time, it has since declined, its large fountain and eating area bow host to two bums and Hooker, who sits alone in a rear booth near the telephone. Dressed in a tuxedo, he nurses a cup of coffee, and anxiously alternates his glances between the clock and the empty street outside.  It's 12:52. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE STORE - DAY \nThe place is full of people, although we avoid long shot so as not to give away the room as a whole yet.  Instead, we concentrate on the tense, waiting faces of some of the more familiar people: \nGondorff and Niles in tuxedos behind a barred cashier's area. Gondorff mutilates a piece of gum in his mouth.  Niles just stares out into space cracking his knuckles. \nGONDORFF Eddie, cut that out, will ya. \nThe boardmarker walking nervously back and forth in front of his odds board, checking every letter and number.  He stops to cross a T on one of the horses' names.  It was already crossed, but he does it again anyway. \nBillie and Singleton, in an area hidden from the rest of the room, watching the print-out on the ticker machine.  The clicking of the ticker is the only sound we hear in the store. \nCurly Jackson in front of a mirror, pasting a fake Van Dyke on his chin to go with his tweed suit and monocle. \nA couple of Billie's girls adjusting their waitress outfits and primping their hair.  Each has a tray full of drinks beside her. \nThe Eirie Kid silently retracing his \"route\" to make sure he has it down. \nDespite the crowd, there is no talking and little movement, save for the constant swirling of smoke from several cigars and cigarettes.  The group is like a theatre company waiting to go on opening night. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DRUGSTORE AGAIN \nIt's 12:56 and Hooker is worried.  He looks up to see two large men, obviously racket goons, come in the front door, and take a seat facing him in the next booth.  They stare at him impassively, waving the waitress away when she comes to take their order.  Hooker knows they're Lonnegan's men, but is somewhat unsettled by the fact that Lonnegan is not with them.  Suddenly, a voice. \nVOICE Carver? \nHooker turns around to find that Lonnegan is seated in the booth directly behind him.  His bodyguard is in the one behind that. \nLONNEGAN You should always look to the back too, kid. \nHOOKER (sliding out of his booth and into Lonnegan's) I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time. \nLONNEGAN (curtly) Get on with it then. \nHOOKER (pointing to telephone) Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse. (pulling out a wad of bills) All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call. \nLONNEGAN You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet. \nHOOKER This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got. \nLONNEGAN And you were gonna pay me back? \nHOOKER I am after this race. \nLonnegan says nothing.  He's not sure he likes a man who's stupid enough to bet his last dollar on a horse race. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. STREET \nHooker hustles out across the street and into the alley. \nINT. DRUGSTORE \nLonnegan watches him through the window and then settles back in his seat to wait for the phone. \nOUTSIDE STORE \nAs Hooker descends the stairwell into the store, he gives Kid Twist the office.  Twist turns away from the window and looks at his watch.  12:58. \nCUT TO: \nDRUGSTORE \nLonnegan waiting by the phone, idly pinging a knife on the salt shaker.  It's 1:40.  A man enters the store and walks over to use the phone. \nLONNEGAN We're waitin' for a call. \nThe man looks at Lonnegan a second, and then at his four goons.  He decides maybe he'll make the call later. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE STORE \nKid Twist again.  Billie enters the room with a piece of paper.  Kid Twist looks at it a second and then picks up the pohne and begins to dial. \nINT. DRUGSTORE \nLonnegan again.  He's getting impatient now and lights a cigarette, and then the phone rings.  He answers it quickly and we hear: \nTWIST Bluenote at 6 to 1 on the nose. \nThe receiver clicks down at the other end.  Lonnegan hangs up and goes out the door, followed by his entourage. \nEXT. STREET \nWe follow him across the street and into the alley, where he signals one of the bodyguards to check the place out.  Kid Twist pushes a button on his window sill, and a buzzer goes off inside the store.  The previously inert figures there spring to life. \nLonnegan's bodyguard descends the stairwell and knocks at the door, where he is greeted by Hooker in the capacity of host.  He looks the place over and motions an okay to Lonnegan. \nINT. THE STORE \nAs Lonnegan enters, we see the room for the first time in its entirety.  Overnight it has been transformed into a swank private club, with bar, cigarette girls, upholstered furniture and chandeliers. \nSINGLETON Look at that.  He's got four apes with him. \nGONDORFF That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em. \nEverywhere there is activity.  A bank of telephones buzzes incessantly.  Sheet writers scurry from phone to phone, taking bets of tremendous size from prominent people. \nSHEET WRITER Yes, Mr. Ruth, 20,000 on Dancing Cloud. \nWe reveal that the phones are controlled by a master switch, which one of the recruited con men operates from behind a partition. \nThe boardmaker, wearing headphones suspended from a sliding wire, hurriedly chalks up races and odds on a huge blackboard. From the loudspeakers we hear the words \"last flash.\" The odds on Bluenote settle down to 8 to 1. \nLonnegan makes his way through the throng toward the betting line.  His bodyguards fan out to various positions in the room.  The betting crowd itself (known as the \"boost\") consists of close to twenty people, none of whom, of course are what they're pretending to be.  There are brokers with pasty faces, sportsmen, tanned and casual, and financiers with goatees and highly tailored clothes.  Large amounts of money are changing hands at the betting window.  Boodles are in sight everywhere. \nLonnegan slips into the betting line, feeling somewhat estranged from the general merriment around him.  There are two men in line ahead of him.  The first, Curly Jackson, slaps down several bundles of cash in front of Niles, who's the cashier, and places a $20,000 bet on War Eagle.  Gondorff appears at the cashier's window and catches sight of Lonnegan. \nGONDORFF Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan. \nLONNEGAN (piercingly) The name is Lonnegan. \nGONDORFF (to Niles) Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have. \nThe man in front of Lonnegan puts $5,000 on Dancing Cloud. He makes the bet on credit.  Lonnegan steps to the window. \nLONNEGAN Two-thousand on Bluenote. \nNILES (writing out a ticket) Is that all? \nLONNEGAN (pissed) That's all. \n", "test1_id": 1770, "test2_input": "HOOKER (getting angry) What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me? \nLONNEGAN (controlled) If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more. \nHooker's in a jam and he knows it. \nHOOKER (after a pause) I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much. \nLONNEGAN Let me talk to him. \nHOOKER (flatly) No. \nLONNEGAN You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law. (softening a bit) C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out. \nHooker says nothing for a minute, and then reluctantly nods his head. \nHOOKER Four o'clock tomorrow.  Pick me up at Dewey Lyle's. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LONNEGAN'S HOTEL - DAY \nWe pick up Hooker coming out of the hotel and going off down the street.  As he does so, we pull back all the way across the street and through the interior of a parked car to reveal the silhouette of a man seated at the wheel.  We move to his right hand, which rests on the steering column.  It's covered by a black glove and the middle finger is missing. His trigger finger, however, taps lightly on the wheel. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AN INDOOR TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY \nOne of the old, wooden kind -- accordian doors with glass panes in the upper half.  Hooker dials rapidly. \nHOOKER Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya. \nTWIST All right, when? \nHOOKER Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money. \nTWIST Okay, Tootsie. \nHooker blows a mock kiss through the phone and hangs up.  He turns to leave the booth, when suddenly he sees something that stops him cold.  There looking through the glass is the smirking face of Detective Synder.  Hooker is immobilized. \nSnyder puts his hand inside his coat and slowly draws out his gun.  He points it right at Hooker's face and then violently smashes all the glass in the upper half of the door with the barrel.  Fragments of glass spray into the booth, a couple of which imbed themselves in Hooker's cheek. \nHooker quickly whips open the door, trapping Snyder's hand in the accordian and jarring loose his gun.  Hooker sprints out of the booth as Snyder scrambles for his pistol and gives pursuit. \nEXT. ALLEYS AND SIDESTREETS - NIGHT - THE TWO MEN \nWe follow the two men up alleys and sidestreets as they race through the dregs of the city, two panting shadows moving through places that only get light at night.  The wind blows drops of blood off Hooker's cheek as he runs.  Snyder still has his gun, but would rather inflict pain than death. \nCONDEMNED BUILDING \nHooker makes for a condemned building and scrambles up the stairs, steps giving way under him as he goes. \nINT. BUILDING \nOn the fourth floor, he ducks into a room and quickly locks the door. \nWe pan the room to reveal that the whole back side of the building is gone.  Hooker runs toward the ledge and leaps through the air, landing on the fire escape of an adjacent building, some 15 feet away.  He kicks in a window and goes off down the hall.  We cut back to \nSnyder furiously kicking in the locked door.  He finally crashes through, only to find an empty room and a beautiful panorama of the city and its nearest Hooverville. \nCUT TO: \nLONG SHOT - HOOKER \nWinding his way through the slum area of town, dashing along backstreets, over fences and through vacant lots, making good his escape.  From our angle, he looks like a rat in a maze. \nGONDORFF (V.O.) Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before? \nHOOKER (V.O.) I thought I'd lost him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GONDORFF'S ROOM AT THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - DAY \nHooker sits sullenly at the table.  Billie stands over him putting some ointment on his face to close the cuts. Gondorff looks on.  Their discussion continues. \n", "test2_true": "HOOKER Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is. \nGONDORFF Then why'd ya move outa your room? \nHOOKER It was too noisy. \nGONDORFF You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker. \nHooker doesn't reply.  He knows Gondorff's on to him. \nGONDORFF You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you? \nHOOKER All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em. \nGONDORFF You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet. (pause) You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'. \nHOOKER A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long. \nGONDORFF (trying to be angry and failing) Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nTHE WIRE \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nINT. A SLEEPY DINER - LATE AFTERNOON \nLocated across the street from Hooker's apartment building. Hooker sits down alone in a booth, with a plate of ham and eggs he's hardly touched. \nThe two cuts on his face have pretty much stopped bleeding. A big fan above the counter area drones away lethargically, it's air stream insufficient to either cool the place or drive out the smell of onions and grease. \nA waitress, Loretta, emerges from the kitchen and ambles slowly over to Hooker's table.  Slim and raven-haired, she manifests an indifference bred from years spent delivering things to people who are rarely grateful for what she brings. Only a light scar on her left cheek hints at another side. \nLORETTA You done? \nHOOKER Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf. \nLORETTA (deadpan) It isn't any better. \nHOOKER Where's June today? \nLORETTA (figuring up the bill) She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here. \nHOOKER Where you goin'? \nLORETTA (putting the check down and walking away) I don't know.  Depends what train I get on. \nHooker looks for some sign that she's putting him on.  He doesn't get it.  He takes out some money, drops it on the table and walks out. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A WESTERN UNION OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA truck with the words CLAYTON BROS., CUSTOM PAINTING AND DECORATING stenciled on the side, is parked out front.  Two men, wearing overalls and painter's caps, walk into the office to the reception counter, we see that they are Twist and Singleton. \nTWIST (to the receptionist) Excuse me.  We're here to paint Mr. Harmon's office. \nRECEPTIONIST (obviously not expecting them) Mr. Harmon's office?  Hold on just a second. \nShe goes to get Mr. Harmon. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE SLEEZY DINER - LATE AFTERNOON \nHooker is standing on the curb outside the diner, obviously waiting for somebody.  Lonnegan's car pulls up and Hooker hops in the back. \nLONNEGAN What happened to your face? \nHOOKER Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring. \n", "test2_id": 1771, "test3_input": "HOOKER Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit. \nCapt. Polk almost laughs, but he checks it. \nHOOKER You got nothin' on me. \nPOLK We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion. (with special emphasis) Counterfeiting, anything you want. \nHooker says nothing, but it's not from defiance now.  He's beginning to get the picture. \nPOLK Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing. \nHOOKER No. \nPOLK You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight? \nHOOKER I'll make parole. \nPOLK Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later. \nHooker wants to come back with something, but can't find it. \nPOLK Don't be a sap, kid.  You could save us a little trouble.  But Henry Gondorff is through whether you help us or not.  There's nothin' left to do now but save yourself. \nHooker's thoroughly whipped.  He sits down for the first time. \nHOOKER (softly) Will you wait until the chump is played? \nPOLK Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets. \nHOOKER (with heat) I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya. \nPOLK All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight. \nHOOKER (barely audible) Just as long as I get to finish the play. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - NIGHT \nGondorff and Hooker are playing gin rummy and drinking. Gondorff makes little comments as he plays, but Hooker is quiet and withdrawn.  The carousel is not in operation and a heavy silence hangs over the place. \nGONDORFF What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much. \nHOOKER Just a little nervous, that's all. \nGONDORFF Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous.  You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it. \nHooker smiles feebly. \nBillie appears at the door. \nBILLIE Things are a little slow tonight, Henry.  I wanna open the round for the girls. \nGondorff takes out a set of keys and tosses them to her. She leaves to go start the merry-go-round.  Gondorff settles back into the game. \nGONDORFF Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know. \nHOOKER (softly) How many guys you conned in your life, Henry? \nGONDORFF Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob.  We had it down to a business. (pause) 'Course Chicago was a right town then.  The fix was in.  The dicks took their end without a beef.  All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us.  Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game. (pause) Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen. \nGondorff chucks his cards on the table.  He's through for the night. \nGONDORFF I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow. \nHOOKER Then why you doin' it? \nGONDORFF Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting. \nThat's good enough.  Hooker gets up to leave. \nHOOKER Henry. \nHOOKER Yeh. \n", "test3_true": "GONDORFF Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid. (pause) Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any. \nHooker just nods and walks out the door. \nINT. CAROUSEL \nWe follow him past the Carousel which is now full of giggling prostitutes in various stages of undress.  Their childish frolicking is charming from a group usually so jaded, but it's lost on Hooker tonight. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A CITY STREET - NIGHT \nIt's late now and the street is deserted save for an occasional derelict or streetwalker on her way home from a night's work.  We pick up Hooker coming down the street toward his apartment building.  He walks slowly, almost reluctantly, as if he didn't care whether he ever got there or not. \nAs he nears his building, he notices Loretta coming out of the diner across the street.  He stops and watches as she looks up and disappears into an adjacent building that advertises rooms for rent.  After a few seconds, we see a light come on in one of its second story windows. \nHooker just stands there a second, debating with himself, trying to figure out a reason for doing what he's going to do anyway.  We follow him across the street to Loretta's building and: \nINT. LORRETA'S \nHe goes up the stairs to the room where the light came on. He passes a couple of derelicts on the way.  He knocks twice and Loretta answers in her bathrobe.  She is more than a little startled to see him. \nLORETTA Looks like he missed ya. \nHOOKER Yeh, this time anyway. \nLoretta notices an old busybody peeping out at them from her room across the hall. \nLORETTA Good night, Mrs. Hillard. \nMrs. Hillard quickly closes her door. \nHOOKER (shuffling a little) I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'. \nLORETTA You move right along, don't ya. \nHOOKER (with more innocence than confidence) I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all. \nLORETTA And you expect me to come over, just like that. \nHOOKER If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall. \nLoretta looks at him carefully.  She knows it's not a line. \nLORETTA (with less resistance now) I don't even know you. \nHOOKER (slowly) You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody. \nThe two just stand there in silence a second.  There's nothing more to say.  She stands back and lets him in. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - NIGHT \nA record spinning lazily on an old phonograph.  We hear Robert Johnson's \"Come On In My Kitchen.\" Gondorff is sitting up in bed, with his hat on, lost in thought.  Billie is curled up asleep next to him.  There's a packed suitcase next to the bed.  Billie wakes up and turns over a second. \nBILLIE C'mon, Henry, knock off.  You've done everything you can. \nGondorff nods his agreement like a zombie and goes right on thinking. \nCUT TO: \nLORRETA'S ROOM \nHooker and Loretta are asleep against each other, their bodies illuminated every few seconds by the light from a neon sign across the street.  We dolly to the window and move in on another window in the building next door.  There's no light on in it, but we can discern the basic outline of a face behind the curtains, which are slightly parted to afford a view of Hooker's room by a black-gloved hand. \n\"I said come on in my kitchen Cause it's gonna be rainin' outdoors.\" \nMusic ends. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nTHE STING \n", "test3_id": 1772}

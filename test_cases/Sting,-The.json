WARD \nTHE STING \nFADE IN: \nA white on black TITLE appears in the lower left hand corner of the screen: \nAUGUST, 1936 \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. A SLUM AREA OF JOLIET - DAY \nIt's a bleak, windy morning, the kind that clears the streets of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters), and the point-men for juvenile gangs.  We pick up a solitary figure, Joe Mottola, coming down the street and entering what appears to be an abandoned tenement.  He pauses a second to dust his white-winged alligator shoes on the back of his pants leg.  Sharply dressed and surrounded by the aura of one who is making money for the first time and broadcasting it on all bands, he seems an incongruity in this part of town. \nWe follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second floor flat.  He knocks on the door, is admitted by a cautious doorman. \nINT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY \nSuddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring people.  This is a spot for the numbers racket, a place immune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet on a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600 to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right.  The bettors are queued up in several lines before a long table, where they place their bets and are given receipts in return. Others wait at a cashier's window to pick up previous earnings or to ask for credit. \nMottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting slips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful and somewhat impatient gaze of a Supervisor, an older man named Mr. Granger.  The Yankee-White Sox game is heard on the radio in the background. \nMottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little interest, saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a little pinch on the cheek.  The girl slaps his hand away, obviously having been through this before. \nPHONE GIRL Beat it, Mottola. \nGranger glances up and exchanges a token nod with Mottola, who plops down in a folding chair next to the radio.  The phone rings. \nPHONE GIRL 8720...Yes, hold on a second. (calling over to the Supervisor) Mr. Granger, Chicago on the line. \nGranger is a little apprehensive about talking to Chicago, but takes the phone anyway. \nGRANGER Yeh? \nCUT TO: \nINT. A WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - CHICAGO - DAY \nA flabby, bald man named Combs is on the other end of the line.  Visible beyond the door and interior window of his office is a large room, cluttered with tables, typewriters, clerks and adding machines.  This room is the clearinghouse for all the transaction of the numbers game.  All the betting slips and income from the spots are brought in here and processed. \nCOMBS Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in. \nGRANGER We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day. \nCOMBS You been making your payoffs, haven't ya? \nGRANGER Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about. \nCOMBS Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night. \nGRANGER Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week. \nCOMBS (not impressed) We cleared 22 here. \nGRANGER Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that? \nCOMBS (reading off a sheet of paper on his desk) They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger. \nINT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY \nGranger burns inside.  One of the girls who's been sorting and counting hands him a slip of paper. \nGRANGER I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15. \nMottola puts the bills in his inside coat pocket, right next to the numbers money.  The stranger, who has now finished bandaging, watches him do it. \nSTRANGER If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there. \nBLACK MAN (suddenly afraid again) What do we do? \nSTRANGER You got a bag or somethin? \nBLACK MAN No. \nSTRANGER How 'bout a handkerchief? \nBLACK MAN Here. \nThe stranger goes into the right coat pocket and pulls out a wrinkled handkerchief. \nSTRANGER Let me have the money. \nMottola takes out the Black Man's five grand and hands it to the Stranger.  He puts it in the handkerchief. \nSTRANGER You better stick that other in here too, if you wanta keep it. \nBLACK MAN (pleading) Just hurry, will ya. \nMottola pulls out the numbers money and puts it in the handkerchief too.  The stranger ties it all up. \nSTRANGER (demonstrating by slipping the bundle down into crotch) All right.  Carry it down in your pants here. (pulling it back out and tucking it in Mottola's pants) Ain't no hard guy in the world gonna frisk ya there. \nMOTTOLA Thanks. (to the black man) So long, partner.  Don't worry, everything's gonna be all right. \nThe Black Man nods gratefully, but there's still a trace of worry on his face.  Mottola trots off down the alley and out onto the street, glancing around cautiously for signs of trouble.  He walks hurriedly down the sidewalk toward the cab stand in the distance.  Suddenly the little man with the knife appears out of a doorway about 15 yards behind him. Mottola notices him and quickens his pace, finally breaking into a dead run. \nWe follow him as he dashes headlong down the street, opening a big lead on the guy with the knife.  He reaches the taxi zone.  He hops in a cab and slams the door. \nINT. TAXI - DAY \nHe jumps in, closes the door, and breathes a sigh of relief. \nCABBIE Where to? \nMOTTOLA Which way is Mason? \nCABBIE About 20 blocks south. \nMOTTOLA Okay, go north.  The Joliet Station -- Fast. \nMottola settles back in his seat and starts to laugh. \nCABBIE What's so funny? \nMOTTOLA I just made the world's easiest five grand. \nHe takes the bundle out from inside his pants in order to gaze upon his new-found fortune.  He unties the handkerchief. It's full of toilet paper.  Mottola looks like he's just been shot. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY - THE STRANGER AND BLACK MAN \nhightailing it down the street, two newly solvent con artists on the lam.  It's hard to run they're laughing so hard.  The stranger chucks his suitcase in a trash can and pulls the real handkerchief out of his pants. \nBLACK MAN Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded? \nSTRANGER Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes. \nAs they split off, music begins, and we go into a \nTITLES SEQUENCE \nDone to a driving Chicago blues, the sequence is designed to establish somewhat the milieu of the stranger, known to friends and enemies alike as Hooker.  We see the following: \nEXT. PAWNSHOP - LOOKING INSIDE - DAY \nHooker is getting a radio and well-worn suit out of hook. It's like seeing old friends again.  All pantomime. \nINT. HOOKER'S ROOM - DAY \nShe walks off down the street. \nHOOKER (going into his pocket for more money) Hey wait a minute. (he comes up with 30\u009b) Aw, the hell with ya. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - LATE AFTERNOON \nA late model Ford roars up and screeches to a stop in front of the plant.  Out bursts a carefully-groomed, tight-lipped young man named Greer, who hustles into the plant.  We follow him through a maze of machinery to the service elevator and up to the third floor where we find ourselves in the clearinghouse room we saw earlier. \nINT. PLANT - AFTERNOON - LATE \nThe working day is over now, and everyone has gone, except for Combs, who sits somberly in his office. \nGREER They found Mottola.  He was drunk in a dive in Joliet.  Never got on the train. \nCOMBS (aggravated) I don't wanta hear about his day, Greer.  What happened to the money? \nGREER He lost it to a coupla con artists on his way outa the spot. \nCOMBS How much? \nGREER Twelve thousand. \nCombs sits in quiet thought for a second.  Finally: \nCOMBS All right.  Better get on the phone to New York.  See what the big mick wants to do about it. (pause) I gotta pretty good idea, though. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AN EXCLUSIVE NEW YORK GAMBLING CLUB - LATE AFTERNOON \nAn agitated young man, Floyd, weaves his way through the craps and roulette tables, and hustles up a staircase to a second floor room with a drawing of a snarling tiger on the door.  Below the tiger, the word \"FARO\" appears.  There is a large man, of thuggish demeanor, guarding the door, but Floyd gives him a small hand signal and walks right by him. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE FARO ROOM \nIn the center is a beautifully-carved wooden table, on which sit a faro board and a dealing box, tended by a stone-faced Dealer, who calls the progress of the game in a continuous abacus-like device that keeps track of the cards which have already been played.  On the opposite side of the table, completely absorbed in the rhythmic appearance of the cards from the dealing box, sits Doyle Lonnegan.  Although is clothes and accessories are those of a wealthy man, there is a coarseness to both his movement and speech which bespeak lower class origins, for which he now has nothing but contempt. \nFloyd enters the room and approaches him cautiously, trying hard to make as little noise as possible. \nFLOYD Doyle, can I see you a minute? \nLONNEGAN (not looking up from the table) I'm busy, Floyd. \nFLOYD It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand. \nLONNEGAN (calmly) Which one? \nFLOYD Mottola. \nLONNEGAN You sure he didn't just pocket it? \nFLOYD No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th. \nLONNEGAN They workin' for anybody? \nFLOYD I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now. \nLONNEGAN All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two. (impassively) We gotta discourage this kinda thing. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AN OLD BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nHooker, still in his suit, but looking a little worse for wear, knocks on the door of one of the apartments.  A young black woman, Louise, answers the door, holding a baby. \nHOOKER Howdy, Louise. \nLOUISE (admiring Hooker in his suit) Goddamn, Johnny Hooker, you're a sharp hunky in them linens.  If you wasn't so pale, I'da sworn you had class. \nHooker steps inside and walks right into a big hug from an older black woman, Alva.  Alva has a hat on, obviously just about to go out.  Beyond her we see the Eirie kid and the Black Man (known from here on as Luther Coleman) playing a game of mah jong on the dining table with a man whose back is to us.  An 11-year-old boy is listening to the radio. \nCOLEMAN Turn that down, Leroy. \nCOLEMAN I'm out, Johnny. \nHOOKER If that's the way you want it. \nCOLEMAN That's the way I want it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A DIMLY LIT STREET - NIGHT \nIt's late at night now.  Hooker and Eirie wander along the street together, not really ready to go home, but with no other ideas either.  Hooker, obviously preoccupied, idly strikes a match on a street lamp as he passes and lets it burn out.  He does this several times. \nHOOKER How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years. \nEIRIE KID Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back. \nHOOKER We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got. \nHOOKER You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know. \nHOOKER There's always a depression on. \nEIRIE KID If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much. \nHOOKER I like griftin'. \nEIRIE KID You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car... \nHOOKER I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie? \nEIRIE KID Forget it. \nThey walk on a few more feet, when suddenly a police car pulls up alongside them and two men jump out.  The first, a uniformed policeman, grabs Eirie around the neck. \nHooker makes a break for it, but the second Figure, a burly detective named Snyder, tackles him in the middle of the street, drags him back into the alley and plasters him up against a brick wall.  The two have met before. \nHOOKER Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes? \nSNYDER You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend. \nHOOKER (knocking Snyder's hand away) Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll. \nSnyder gives Hooker a swift knee in the thigh and follows it with an elbow across the head.  Hooker flies into a row of boxes and garbage cans. \nHOOKER (getting up slowly) You got the wrong guy, pal.  I been home with the flu all day. (rising to a fuller height) You can stake out my toilet if you want. \nBang.  Snyder, infuriated by Hooker's irreverence, slams him to the ground again.  The policeman is no longer holding Eirie but is almost daring him to make a move.  Eirie wants to go to Hooker's aid, but he knows the policeman will beat him to a pulp. \nSNYDER (pulling Hooker out of the heap and smashing him against the wall again) I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect. \nHOOKER (startled by the information) You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money. \nSNYDER Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly. \nHOOKER I'll square it with the fixer. \nSNYDER Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya. \nSnyder lets go.  Hooker sinks back against the wall.  He says nothing; he's waiting for the price. \nSNYDER I figure your end of the score was at least 3 gees.  I want 2 no matter what it was. \nHOOKER (lying) My end was only one. \nSNYDER (not taking the fake) Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere. \nHooker is beat and he knows it. \nHOOKER All right. \nHe reaches into his coat, pulls out a stack of bills and counts out $2000 to Snyder.  Eirie looks on in amazement; he didn't think Hooker had it. \nSNYDER (pocketing the money and motioning his partner to put his gun away) You're a smart egg, Hooker.  No use dyin' for 2 grand. \nSnyder and his policeman friend get in their car and start down the street.  Hooker and Eirie walk nonchalantly in the other direction. \nSTATION - HALLWAY - DAY \nWe see Hooker removing a sign from a door, but the angle prohibits us from reading it. \nINT. STATION - DAY \nHe drops the sign in a waste can and walks out into the crowded passenger lobby.  After scanning the area carefully for a minute, he goes up to a conservative young business man, who's busy reading the schedule board. \nHOOKER (flashing open his wallet to reveal the little tin badge and then closing it again quickly) Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions. \nMAN (flustered) What for?  I haven't done anything. \nHOOKER We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today? \nMAN (reluctantly) Yes, a ticket to Chicago. \nHOOKER Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please? \nMAN (handing them over) But I got a train to make. \nHOOKER (taking out the money and returning the wallet) It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall. \nMAN But what about all these other people? \nHOOKER (blowing up) We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh? (pointing to his suit) You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge. (pouring it on) I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes. \nThe Businessman is totally shamed. \nMAN I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes. \nHOOKER All right, I'll give ya a break. (pointing to a hall) Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this... (he holds up the money) ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes. \nMAN Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this. \nHOOKER (with a little wave) Think nothin' of it. \nThe man goes off down the hall, more than grateful to be given a break like this.  Hooker heads for the \"back\".  We follow the Man down the hall to the unmarked door.  He strides on through to find himself face to face with a wall of busily flushing urinals. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STATION - DAY - HOOKER \nBoarding the 8:10 for Chicago. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STATION - DAY \nThe Man wandering up and down the hall, wondering how he could have missed that room. \nEXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY \nThe street runs along side an elevated train track.  We pick up Hooker coming down the street, eating a hot dog he bought with the money he just earned in the train station. \nHe appears to be looking for an address, referring every now and then to the piece of paper Luther gave him the night before.  Finally he stops in front of an old three-story building which contains a carousel on the bottom 2 floors and what appear to be apartments on the third floor.  He peers inside the big, sliding glass doors and seeing no sign of life, goes around to the side to look for a way in. \nA 35 year-old woman, Billie, appears in her bathrobe on the second floor landing and descends the stairs to get the morning paper.  She's eating an apple.  Although she has just gotten up and looks it, she has the presence of one who is probably quite striking at other hours.  The sight of Hooker fazes her not at all. \nHOOKER Excuse me, I'm looking for a guy named Henry Gondorff.  You know him? \nBILLIE (starting back up the stairs) No. \nHOOKER Luther Coleman sent me. \nBillie stops and comes back down the stairs.  It's the first time she's stopped chewing. \nBILLIE (checking him out) You Hooker? \nHOOKER Yeh. \nBILLIE Why didn't you say so.  I thought maybe you was a copper or somethin'. \nShe goes to a side door and unlocks it. \nBILLIE It's the room in the back.  He wasn't expecting you so soon though. \nLONNEGAN Hackers. \nFLOYD They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up? \nLonnegan regards Floyd patiently and then pats the bench beside him.  Floyd sits gingerly. \nLONNEGAN You see the guy in the red sweater over there? \nWe cut to one of Lonnegan's foursome, a short, squat little Irishman in a red sweater.  He was a good-time, friendly manner and a winning Irish smile.  We like him immediately. \nLONNEGAN Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'? \nFLOYD Yes sir. \nLONNEGAN Good lad. \nLonnegan is called to the tee by one of his foursome.  He exchanges a friendly smile with McCoy and belts the ball down the fairway. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE CAROUSEL AGAIN - DAY \nGondorff, dried off now and in a new set of clothes, is pulling up the shades of the large facing windows of the carousel building.  The morning light pours in, illuminating fully for the first time the ornate merry-go-round and its massive oaken horses.  Hooker watches him go about his business.  Billie calls down from the mezzanine which surrounds the carousel. \nBILLIE You feeling all right this morning, Henry? \nGONDORFF Fine, Billie. \nBILLIE You mind opening the round a little early today?  We got some business coming in before hours. \nGondorff waves okay. \nGONDORFF (to Hooker) Great little countess, that Billie. Runs a good house up there, too. One of the few left that Luciano doesn't own. \nGondorff walks around on the carousel, checking straps, bearing and poles.  Hooker follows him. \nHOOKER (getting impatient) Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not? \nGONDORFF (on his back, checking underneath one of the horses) You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it. \nHOOKER I wanna play for Lonnegan. \nGONDORFF (getting up) You know anything about him? \nHOOKER (exploding) Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else do I gotta know. \nGondorff just sits tight and waits for him to cool off. \nHOOKER (waving Gondorff off, embarrassed at his own outburst) Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side. \nGONDORFF (going over to start the machinery) And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya. \nHOOKER I'll take him anyway. \nGONDORFF (whirling on him) Why? \nHOOKER (like steel) 'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him. \nIt's the right answer. Gondorff didn't know it himself until now. \nGONDORFF You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good. \nHOOKER We'll get by without 'em. \nGONDORFF This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy. \nHOOKER (incensed) I never played for winos. \nGONDORFF (going right on, ignoring Hooker's remark) You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more. \nHOOKER You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya? \nGONDORFF Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death. \nHOOKER Then you'll do it? \nBILLIE (to the bartender) Set me up five more beers, will ya Danny. \nAs Danny goes to fill the mugs, Billie's eyes fix on a man at the end of the bar. \nWe move to reveal Snyder, intently scanning the room, as if he'd lost a dancing partner in the crush.  Not finding what he wants, he comes down the bar to Billie. \nSNYDER You the owner here? \nBILLIE That's right. \nSNYDER (flipping out his badge) Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco. \nBILLIE Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here. \nSNYDER (trying to ignore her remark) I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here. \nBILLIE Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters. \nSNYDER All right if I look around your lobby? \nBILLIE No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go. \nBillie grabs a bottle of beer, pours some in a shot glass and pushes it over to Snyder.  He ignores the gesture. \nSNYDER (with controlled force) I don't really need your permission. \nWe go to Billie.  She knew that when he came in. \nCUT TO: \nTHE STORAGE ROOM AGAIN \nThe discussion continues.  Hooker, a bit out of his depth here, listens and stays silent. \nSINGLETON Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play. \nGONDORFF Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie? \nNILES He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back. \nGONDORFF Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways. \nNILES The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York. \nGONDORFF Fancies himself a gambler, huh? \nTWIST Lotta plungers ride that train just to play him. \nGONDORFF (breaking into a smile) See J.J., he's slowly down already. \nCUT TO: \nTHE RECEIVING ROOM AGAIN \nSnyder has completed his inspection of the \"lobby\" and found nothing.  Danny, meanwhile, has set up the five beers on a tray. \nSNYDER Which way are the rooms? \nBILLIE Who told ya this guy was in here? \nSNYDER Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him. \nBILLIE Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name. \nSNYDER I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms? \nBILLIE Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. (picks up the tray) \nSNYDER (snidely) What are ya gonna do, call the cops? \nBILLIE I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. (she exits with the drinks) \nSnyder is stopped cold.  He calls after her. \nSNYDER Keep your nose clean, lady.  He can't spend all his time here. \nTWIST We'll take it. (pointing through the door) You manage the building at the end of the alley? \nOLD MAN (with pride) For fifteen years. \nTWIST I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week? \nOLD MAN Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them. \nTWIST (pulling out his wallet) This is the last time I expect to see you down here. \nOLD MAN (watching the bills being counted into his hand) Never heard of the place. \nWe go back to Niles and Garfield. \nGARFIELD Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore. \nNILES All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later. \nGARFIELD All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though. \nNILES C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters. \nGARFIELD You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up. (pause) Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit? \nNILES Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down. \nTwist has rejoined them by now. \nTWIST (to Garfield) You wanna work flat rate or percentage? \nGARFIELD Who's the mark? \nTWIST Doyle Lonnegan. \nGARFIELD Flat rate. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A NEW YORK TRAIN STATION - DAY \nWe pick up Doyle Lonnegan, accompanied by two bodyguards and Floyd, making his way through the station.  He stops at a cigar counter to buy some cigarettes, and we reveal Gondorff and Hooker sitting on their suitcases on the other side of the room. \nGONDORFF (eyes fixed on Lonnegan) Guy in the blue pinstripe and grey fedora. \nHooker looks and finally spots him in the crowd.  We go back to Lonnegan, as he moves off from the cigar counter, toward his train.  Hooker watches him with the intensity of one gazing on a religious object. \nHOOKER He's not as tough as he'd like to think. \nGONDORFF (picking up his suitcase) Neither are we. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TRAIN \nLonnegan and his retainers getting on the train.  Two cars down the line, we see Hooker and Gondorff boarding also.  On his way in, Gordorff takes the conductor aside. \nGONDORFF I hear there's a friendly poker game on this train tonight.  You know anything about that? \nCONDUCTOR A little. \nGONDORFF You think you could get me in that game? \nCONDUCTOR I don't know.  There's usually a waiting list. \nGondorff flashes a $50 bill. \nCONDUCTOR (loosening up a bit) That'll get you first alternate, sir. \nGondorff pulls out another fifty. \nCONDUCTOR (taking the money) I'll see what I can do. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A BASEMENT BAR - EARLY EVENING \nGondorff is rapidly shuffling cards to four empty places. He is alone.  He looks up as Singleton enters. \nSINGLETON You in? \nGONDORFF Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck? \nSINGLETON He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza. (handing him two sealed decks) I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's. \nGONDORFF Nice work, J.J. \nSingleton slips out as Gondorff unpeels the packs. \nINT. TRAIN - NIGHT \nWe pick up Lonnegan coming out of his compartment, flanked by only one bodyguard and Floyd.  He starts through the passenger section toward the compartment where the poker game will be held.  Suddenly a drunken woman comes staggering around the corner and bumps into him. \nThey grapple a moment and Lonnegan pushes her away in disgust. \nWOMAN (sloppy drunk) Keep your mitts off me, ya big lug. If I'da wanted you handlin' me I woulda asked ya. \nLonnegan ignores her and proceeds down the passageway.  As the woman proceeds in the other direction between passengers, we see it is Billie.  She drops something on a seat beside a passenger.  A hand reaches to pick it up.  It is Lonnegan's wallet and it is Hooker who picks it up. \nHooker waits a moment, then stands and goes in the direction Lonnegan has taken.  He passes by the open door to the card room, hesitating only slightly to hear the greetings exchanged inside before the door is shut.  Then he continues on into the next car.  He turns into Gondorff's compartment. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GONDORFF'S COMPARTMENT - NIGHT \nGondorff is still practicing.  He looks up as Hooker enters and tosses him the wallet. \nHOOKER She got him clean.  He hasn't missed it. \nGondorff nods, takes the money out, counts it. \nGONDORFF Fifteen grand.  Looks like he's expecting a big night. \nHe takes out his own wallet and puts the money in it, and tosses the empty wallet back to Hooker, and resumes his shuffling and dealing.  Hooker sits back silently and watches him. \nHOOKER He's waitin' for you in the card room. \nGONDORFF Let him wait. \nAs he deals, on the second pass he attempts to cut from the bottom, muffs it completely and sprays half the deck on the table.  Hooker regards him steadily as he gathers them back up.  Gondorff finally meets his gaze. \nGONDORFF You just worry about your end, kid. \nHOOKER If we ever get to it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE POKER ROOM - NIGHT \nA specially outfitted compartment with a table and chairs in the middle and leather cushions around the outside for kibitzers.  Lonnegan and 3 other players are already there and seated.  They're getting slightly impatient. \nLONNEGAN (to the Conductor) Where the hell is this guy? \nCONDUCTOR I don't know.  He said he'd be here. \nCUT TO: \nGONDORFF'S CABIN AGAIN \nGondorff is standing in front of the mirror dressing.  He grabs up a clean white shirt and rumples it up in his hands. He then picks up a half-full bottle of bourbon.  Hooker gives him a disapproving look.  Gondorff smiles and pats some on his face. \nCUT TO: \nTHE POKER ROOM AGAIN \nEverybody's itchy now. \nLONNEGAN All right, let's start without him. Mr. Clemens, give me the cards. \nThe Conductor hands him a sealed deck.  As he begins to open it, Gordoff comes into the room, coatless, rumpled, unshaven and looking slightly tipsy.  The others at the table, all men of high school or financial standing, are somewhat put off. \nGONDORFF Sorry I'm late boys.  I was takin' a crap. \nTWIST You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up? \nDUFF Wasn't no problem a mine. \nTWIST He was a con man, wasn't he? \nDUFF He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills. \nTWIST (like ice) Shove off, Duff. \nDuff stands there a second and then slouches away from the table.  He stops however, by the door.  The next man up is the Eirie Kid.  Twist knows he's seen him somewhere before. \nEIRIE KID (nervous as hell) Names's Joe Eirie. \nTwist waits for more, but it's not coming. \nTWIST You played for any particular mobs? \nEIRIE KID No. \nTWIST You know the Wire at all? \nEIRIE KID No...I never played no Big Con before.  But Luther Coleman was a friend a mine.  I thought maybe there was something I could do. \nTWIST (pointing to Eirie slightly swollen nose) You get that nose in Duke Boudreau's tonight? \nEirie nods a reluctant \"yes.\" \nTWIST You got moxie, Eirie.  Get yourself a suit. \nEirie is so happy, he can barely blurt out a thank you. Buck Duff, enraged that Twist would hire a total amateur, turns in disgust and strides vengefully out of the store. \nCUT TO: \nTHE CARD GAME AGAIN \nThe room is dense with smoke now, and the players are feeling the heat.  Gondorff has his white shirt open, revealing a stained T-shirt underneath.  The bottle next to him is almost empty.  He sneezes and wipes his nose with the tie Lonnegan gave him. \nThe chips are now about equally divided between Gondorff and Lonnegan.  The others are losing badly. \nGONDORFF Raise 300. \nLONNEGAN Pass. \nJAMESON (throwing in his last few chips) Raise 200. \nGONDORFF Two and call. \nJameson lays down two pair.  Gondorff has a flush.  Gondorff rakes in the chips, which now put him ahead of Lonnegan. \nJAMESON Well, I'm out. \nGONDORFF Don't worry about it, pal.  Lemongan here wouldn'ta let you in the game if you weren't a chump. \nLONNEGAN (getting to his feet) I've had enough of your lip, Shaw. \nGondorff grabs the whiskey bottle next to him, breaks it against the table and waves the jagged end in Lonnegan's face. \nGONDORFF (barely able to stand up) Just take it easy there, Larrabee. \nJameson and the conductor step in between. \nJAMESON Let's take a break for a couple minutes and cool off. \nLonnegan storms out of the room, followed by Floyd and Bodyguard. \nINT. SMOKING ROOM \nWe pick up Lonnegan coming down the passageway to enter the smoking room. \nLONNEGAN (to his assistant) I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler. \nFLOYD (trying to settle him down) You've only been playin three hours, Doyle. \nLONNEGAN (not to be pacified) I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal. \nLONNEGAN What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me? \nThere's a knock at the door.  Floyd goes and opens it.  It's Hooker. \nHOOKER My name's Carver.  Mr. Shaw sent me. \nFloyd motions him in without a word. \nLONNEGAN Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it? \nHOOKER (very matter-of-factly) He cheats. \nLonnegan says nothing.  He doesn't like smart asses.  He looks Hooker over a second, as if considering whether to have him wasted or not. \nLONNEGAN (reaching into his coat pocket) He'll have to take a check. (pulling out a check) I couldn't find my wallet. \nHOOKER Yeh, he knows that. \nLONNEGAN (startled) What do you mean? \nHOOKER (pulling out Lonnegan's wallet and tossing it to him) He hired a dame to take it from ya. \nLonnegan just holds the wallet.  He can't believe it. \nHOOKER You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya. \nLONNEGAN (the heat rising) I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy. \nHOOKER (cool as hell) So could Shaw. \nLONNEGAN Then why the rat? \nHOOKER Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger. (pause) I want you to help me break him. \nLonnegan looks at Hooker long and hard, as if the intensity of his gaze could separate truth from fiction.  Lonnegan hadn't expected this, but now that it's here, it better be on the level.  The silence is suddenly broken by the noise of the train braking into the station. \nLONNEGAN (to Hooker) C'mon, I'll give ya a lift home. \nHooker hesitates, not sure whether to accept or not. \nLONNEGAN What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw? \nHOOKER Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway. \nLONNEGAN All right, then. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LONNEGAN'S CAR - NIGHT \nDriving through the city, the driver and Floyd in front, Hooker and Lonnegan in back. \nHooker glances out the window from time to time, just to make sure they're really going to his place. \nLONNEGAN Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from. \nHOOKER I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal. \nLONNEGAN (insulted) I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state. \nHOOKER All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information. \nLonnegan is listening, but you'd never know it. \nHOOKER If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself. \nLONNEGAN That's worth fifteen grand to ya? \nHOOKER Maybe a couple million. \nWe go to Lonnegan.  He's still not talking, but that last phrase has registered. \nEXT. HOOKER'S PLACE \nThe car pulls up in front of Hooker's place. \nBluenote's race is now up on the board.  The race caller comes on the loudspeaker. \nCALLER Ladies and Gentlemen.  This is Arnold Rowe, your caller for the second race at Belmont in New York. A mile and 1/8.  Four year olds and up.  And they're off! \nWe see that the caller is Singleton, and that he's calling the race from a concealed booth next to the cashier's cage. \nCALLER Around the first turn it's a War Eagle first by a length, Jail Bate second by one and a half, Dancing Cloud third by a half on the outside, followed by Lucky Lady, Mojo, Wits' End and Bluenote. \nLonnegan goes to the bar, orders a drink, and settles down at one of the tables.  It happens to be the one the Eirie Kid is at.  Gondorff and Niles watch it from the cashier's cage. \nGONDORFF (worried) That's not where we want him to sit. \nEirie tries to ignore Lonnegan at first, but realizes he better make some conversation. \nEIRIE KID C'mon War Eagle. (to Lonnegan) That Dancing Cloud's a hell of a finisher.  War Eagle's gonna have to open up a little more on 'em. \nLONNEGAN You know anything about a horse named Bluenote? \nEIRIE KID Naw, he's never done much.  Probably in here just to round out the field. War Eagle's where you wanna have your money. \nEirie excuses himself and heads for the bar. \nCALLER Into the clubhouse turn, it's War Eagle by two lengths, Dancing Cloud has moved up to second by a half, Lucky Lady is third by three followed by Jail Bait, Mojo, Bluenote and Wits' End. \nThe heretofore chaotic energy of the parlor is now focused on the race.  Several of the patrons begin to yell for their horses.  Lonnegan remains seated.  He seems bored with it all.  Hooker comes over to clear some empty glasses from his table. \nLONNEGAN (out of the corner of his mouth) You really picked a winner, kid. \nHOOKER Give 'em a little time. \nCALLER Into the backstretch it's War Eagle still by a length, Dancing Cloud closing on the inside, is second by two, Lucky Lady is third by one and a half, followed by Bluenote, Jail Bait, Wits' End and Mojo. \nLonnegan perks up just a little.  Bluenote, at least, has moved up.  The rest of the people in the place are really rooting now.  Few of them remain seated. \nHooker arrives at the bar, with the glasses he cleared from Lonnegan's table.  Eirie is already there, fortifying himself with a scotch. \nHOOKER You're doin' great, Eirie.  He loves ya. \nEirie nods, somewhat unconvinced, and heads bak to the table. \nCALLER Into the far turn, it's Dancing Cloud now by half a length, War Eagle is second by two, Bluenote is third by a half and moving fast on the outside.  Lucky Lady is fourth by four lengths, followed by Jail Bait, Wits' End and Mojo. \nLonnegan is getting more intent now. \nCALLER Coming down the stretch, it's Dancing Cloud by one length, War Eagle and Bluenote are neck and neck by two.  Now it's Dancing Cloud, Bluenote and War Eagle. (shouting now) Dancing Cloud and Bluenote head to head... \nThe place is going crazy.  Even Singleton is standing up to get the necessary excitement in his voice. \nCALLER Dancing Cloud, Bluenote.  Dancing Cloud, Bluenote.  It's Bluenote by a nose.  Dancing Cloud is second by two, War Eagle third by three and a half.  Time for a mile and 1/8, 2:01 and 6/10 seconds. \nMost of the patrons collapse into their chairs like spent lovers.  Eirie slams his racing form to the floor.  Nobody had Bluenote. \nCURLY (tearing up his ticket) Bloody awful.  Who in blazes is Bluenote? \nLONNEGAN (to Eirie, very self-satisfied) War Eagle's where you want to have your money, huh? \nEirie doesn't reply.  He can't believe Bluenote won. Lonnegan looks to Hooker.  Hooker gives him a wink.  For the first time, Lonnegan permits a smile. \nCUT TO: \nLONNEGAN AT THE CASHIER'S WINDOW \nNiles is counting out $16,000 to him (all of which Gondorff won the night before).  Gondorff looks somewhat perturbed. Lonnegan picks up the money and tauntingly waves it at him. \nGONDORFF (getting his name right this time) Don't bother to come back with a piker's bet like that again, Lonnegan.  We got a $5,000 minimum here. (to Hooker) Show this bum out. \nHooker hesitates a second. \nGONDORFF Go on, ya goddamn ninny. \nGondorff gives Hooker a hard shove in the back with his foot, sending him into a table and sprawling to the floor. \nGONDORFF (indicating Lonnegan's bodyguards) And tell him not to bring his garbage men in here no more.  This is a class joint. \nHooker, pretending to be humiliated, gets to his feet and escorts Lonnegan to the door.  Lonnegan stops, gives Gondorff a derisive smile, and walks out.  Once he's gone, the general clatter and hubbub in the room cease, like it had been turned off by a faucet.  Most of the boost sit down and relax.  Curly Jackson rips off his Van Dyke.  It's been itching him. \nHOOKER (getting angry) What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me? \nLONNEGAN (controlled) If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more. \nHooker's in a jam and he knows it. \nHOOKER (after a pause) I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much. \nLONNEGAN Let me talk to him. \nHOOKER (flatly) No. \nLONNEGAN You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law. (softening a bit) C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out. \nHooker says nothing for a minute, and then reluctantly nods his head. \nHOOKER Four o'clock tomorrow.  Pick me up at Dewey Lyle's. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LONNEGAN'S HOTEL - DAY \nWe pick up Hooker coming out of the hotel and going off down the street.  As he does so, we pull back all the way across the street and through the interior of a parked car to reveal the silhouette of a man seated at the wheel.  We move to his right hand, which rests on the steering column.  It's covered by a black glove and the middle finger is missing. His trigger finger, however, taps lightly on the wheel. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AN INDOOR TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY \nOne of the old, wooden kind -- accordian doors with glass panes in the upper half.  Hooker dials rapidly. \nHOOKER Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya. \nTWIST All right, when? \nHOOKER Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money. \nTWIST Okay, Tootsie. \nHooker blows a mock kiss through the phone and hangs up.  He turns to leave the booth, when suddenly he sees something that stops him cold.  There looking through the glass is the smirking face of Detective Synder.  Hooker is immobilized. \nSnyder puts his hand inside his coat and slowly draws out his gun.  He points it right at Hooker's face and then violently smashes all the glass in the upper half of the door with the barrel.  Fragments of glass spray into the booth, a couple of which imbed themselves in Hooker's cheek. \nHooker quickly whips open the door, trapping Snyder's hand in the accordian and jarring loose his gun.  Hooker sprints out of the booth as Snyder scrambles for his pistol and gives pursuit. \nEXT. ALLEYS AND SIDESTREETS - NIGHT - THE TWO MEN \nWe follow the two men up alleys and sidestreets as they race through the dregs of the city, two panting shadows moving through places that only get light at night.  The wind blows drops of blood off Hooker's cheek as he runs.  Snyder still has his gun, but would rather inflict pain than death. \nCONDEMNED BUILDING \nHooker makes for a condemned building and scrambles up the stairs, steps giving way under him as he goes. \nINT. BUILDING \nOn the fourth floor, he ducks into a room and quickly locks the door. \nWe pan the room to reveal that the whole back side of the building is gone.  Hooker runs toward the ledge and leaps through the air, landing on the fire escape of an adjacent building, some 15 feet away.  He kicks in a window and goes off down the hall.  We cut back to \nSnyder furiously kicking in the locked door.  He finally crashes through, only to find an empty room and a beautiful panorama of the city and its nearest Hooverville. \nCUT TO: \nLONG SHOT - HOOKER \nWinding his way through the slum area of town, dashing along backstreets, over fences and through vacant lots, making good his escape.  From our angle, he looks like a rat in a maze. \nGONDORFF (V.O.) Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before? \nHOOKER (V.O.) I thought I'd lost him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GONDORFF'S ROOM AT THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - DAY \nHooker sits sullenly at the table.  Billie stands over him putting some ointment on his face to close the cuts. Gondorff looks on.  Their discussion continues. \nPOLK (enraged) Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it. \nSNYDER What the hell good is Hooker to ya? \nPOLK He's gonna set up Gondorff for us. \nSNYDER He'll never do it. \nPOLK (self-satisfied) I think he will. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DRUGSTORE - DAY \nLonnegan sits by the phone, watching the clock and sipping a cup of coffee. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE STORE - DAY \nSpecifically, the small room from which Singleton does his race broadcasts.  Singleton, himself, is hunched over the ticker machine, reading the print-out.  Billie sits at the microphone table with a pencil and pad, ready to write. \nSINGLETON Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third. \nBILLIE What's the line on Visitation? \nSINGLETON (checking further up on the print-out sheet) 7 to 2.  That ain't bad. \nBILLIE He'll probably fall down. \nGondorff appears at the doorway. \nGONDORFF How ya doin'? \nSINGLETON (eyes still glued to the ticker) Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'. \nBILLIE Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today. \nSINGLETON (excited) Billie.  You ready? \nBillie prepares to write on her pad. \nBILLIE Yeh, go ahead. \nSINGLETON At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third. (reading up the sheet again) Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good. \nBillie crumples up the piece of paper she's been writing on and chucks it in a wastecan. \nGONDORFF We don't need big odds on this one, J.J.  Take anything you get at 3-1 or better. \nGondorff leaves the room, as Singleton turns back to his vigil at the ticker. \nSINGLETON (a little weary) Okay, the Fairfield Stakes at Santa Anita.  Mile and a quarter for 3 year olds and up. \nCUT TO: \nTHE FLOOR AREA OF THE STORE \nEveryone is in his place as before.  Today, however, Curly Jackson is playing the part of the aging sport. \nWell scrubbed and clean shaven, he cuts a dashing figure in his blue blazer and white pants.  We go to Gondorff in the cashier's cage.  He's talking to Niles, who's busy handing out fake bankrolls to members of the boost. \nGONDORFF He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got? \nNILES Not enough to cover a bet that big. \nGONDORFF Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out. \nNiles nods. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DRUGSTORE - DAY \nLonnegan is still waiting.  He takes the 20 grand out of his coat pocket and thumbs through it, just to make sure it's all there. \nEIRIE KID Me too.  Maybe it's our day. \nLonnegan nods and wanders away.  Hooker comes over to him. \nHOOKER What happened? \nLONNEGAN I didn't get the bet down in time. \nHOOKER (pissed) Oh, Jesus. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STORE OFFICE \nGondorff and Niles, back in the office. \nNILES (looking out at the floor) Looks like he's sulking. \nGONDORFF If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever. \nCUT TO: \nTHE FLOOR \nCALLER Coming for home, it's Wrecking Crew by six lengths, Made to Order is second by two and a half, High Ground is third by a length and Grand Theft is coming fast on the rail.  It's Wrecking Crew, Made to Order and Grand Theft.  Wrecking Crew wins it by five lengths, Grand Theft is second by a nose, Made to Order is third by two.  Time for one and 3/8 mile, 2:11 and 4/10 seconds. \nEirie explodes in a joyous frenzy.  He grabs Lonnegan by the shoulders and shakes him. \nEIRIE KID We won!  We won!  You hear that!  I won 30,000!  You hear that! \nYeh, Lonnegan heard that.  Lonnegan shakes loose, grabs his coat and heads for the door. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nHe finds Hooker waiting for him outside. \nLONNEGAN Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time. \nHOOKER How am I gonna do that? \nLONNEGAN (coarsely) I don't know, figure something out. \nLonnegan storms across the street to his waiting car and drives off.  Hooker relaxes into a smile.  He's already figured something out. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SLEEZY DINER ACROSS FROM HOOKER'S APT. BLDG. - EVENING \nHooker sits at the counter finishing a plate of meat loaf. Loretta is down at the cash register, leaning on the counter, looking idly out into space.  Hooker glances over at her every once in a while to see if she might be interested in striking up a little conversation.  She's not.  He finishes his meal and comes down to the register to pay his bill. \nHOOKER Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee. \nLORETTA (ringing it up) Sixty-five. \nHooker gives her a dollar.  She goes to the register for change. \nHOOKER What time you get off work here? \nLORETTA 2:00 A.M. \nHOOKER You doin' anything tonight? \nLORETTA (handing him his change) Yeh, sleepin'. \nHooker figures that's enough of that.  He pockets his change and starts out the door, when suddenly he stops short. \nEXT. STREET \nAcross the street in a doorway is the silhouette of a man. It's Cole.  He's pretending not to look at the diner, but Hooker isn't fooled. \nINT. DINER \nHe goes back to Loretta at the register. \nHOOKER You got a back door to this place? \nHOOKER Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit. \nCapt. Polk almost laughs, but he checks it. \nHOOKER You got nothin' on me. \nPOLK We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion. (with special emphasis) Counterfeiting, anything you want. \nHooker says nothing, but it's not from defiance now.  He's beginning to get the picture. \nPOLK Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing. \nHOOKER No. \nPOLK You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight? \nHOOKER I'll make parole. \nPOLK Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later. \nHooker wants to come back with something, but can't find it. \nPOLK Don't be a sap, kid.  You could save us a little trouble.  But Henry Gondorff is through whether you help us or not.  There's nothin' left to do now but save yourself. \nHooker's thoroughly whipped.  He sits down for the first time. \nHOOKER (softly) Will you wait until the chump is played? \nPOLK Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets. \nHOOKER (with heat) I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya. \nPOLK All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight. \nHOOKER (barely audible) Just as long as I get to finish the play. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - NIGHT \nGondorff and Hooker are playing gin rummy and drinking. Gondorff makes little comments as he plays, but Hooker is quiet and withdrawn.  The carousel is not in operation and a heavy silence hangs over the place. \nGONDORFF What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much. \nHOOKER Just a little nervous, that's all. \nGONDORFF Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous.  You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it. \nHooker smiles feebly. \nBillie appears at the door. \nBILLIE Things are a little slow tonight, Henry.  I wanna open the round for the girls. \nGondorff takes out a set of keys and tosses them to her. She leaves to go start the merry-go-round.  Gondorff settles back into the game. \nGONDORFF Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know. \nHOOKER (softly) How many guys you conned in your life, Henry? \nGONDORFF Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob.  We had it down to a business. (pause) 'Course Chicago was a right town then.  The fix was in.  The dicks took their end without a beef.  All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us.  Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game. (pause) Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen. \nGondorff chucks his cards on the table.  He's through for the night. \nGONDORFF I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow. \nHOOKER Then why you doin' it? \nGONDORFF Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting. \nThat's good enough.  Hooker gets up to leave. \nHOOKER Henry. \nHOOKER Yeh. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nWe open on Hooker in bed, the morning sun streaming in on his face.  He awakens slowly, looks at the ceiling for a second and, remembering last night, turns to the side to find that Loretta is no longer there.  Still drowsy, he gets out of bed and looks around the room for a note or some evidence of her continued presence.  He opens an empty closet, then opens empty drawers.  Finding nothing, he suddenly hits on another possibility, and looks in his wallet.  The money is still there.  Almost disappointed, he slumps down in a chair, as the harsh reality of what will happen this day floods back in on him.  Music begins and we: \nCUT TO: \nINT. AN UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY \nWe see the black-gloved hand opening a small wooden box. Wrapped inside is a shiny black revolver, at this point in two pieces.  The hand reaches in and takes them out. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE SLEEZY DINER - DAY \nHooker is poking at a plate of waffles and sausage.  The waitress on duty is not Loretta and Hooker has noticed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - DAY \nGondorff is standing in front of the bathroom mirror, putting on his tuxedo.  He goes to his dresser, pulls out a very small gun and tucks it in his cummerbund. \nCUT TO: \nTHE GUNNMAN'S ROOM AGAIN \nThe hand swirls a pipe cleaner inside the barrel of the revolver and picks some lint out of the chamber.  He then screws the barrel onto the body.  This is all seen in closeup. \nCUT TO: \nHOOKER'S ROOM AGAIN \nHooker now has his tuxedo on.  He takes two small rubber bladders out of a drawer and puts them in his pocket. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LONNEGAN'S SUITE - DAY \nLonnegan paces nervously around the room, looking at the clock.  Obviously waiting for something, he's getting extremely impatient. \nCUT TO: \nTHE GUNNMAN'S ROOM AGAIN \nWe watch the hand carefully loading bullets into the chamber of the revolver. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - DAY \nGondorff emerges from his room carrying his suitcase.  He stops and looks up at the mezzanine where Billie is standing. They smile sadly at each other and give a simple wave, having done this too many times to get sentimental about it now.  Gondorff walks out of the building. \nCUT TO: \nHOOKER'S ROOM AGAIN \nHooker is busily stuffing all his possessions in a paper bag, lumping clothes with food, records and toilet articles. \nCUT TO: \nLONNEGAN'S SUITE AGAIN \nLonnegan goes to the door to admit Floyd and two assistants, one of whom carries a large brief case.  Lonnegan takes the brief case to a table and opens it.  Inside is a half million dollars in cash. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE GUNNMAN'S ROOM AGAIN \nWe see the hand putting a silencer on the revolver.  The gunman puts the revolver up to his eye to check the alignment and for the first time we see the face that goes with the hand.  It is fully as menacing as we had imagined: Broad, flat nose, thick cracked lips, narrow eyes and cauliflower ears. \nCUT TO: \nHOOKER'S ROOM AGAIN \n", "test1_input": "GONDORFF Did he say he wouldn't? \nHOOKER No. \nGONDORFF (softly) He'll show. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nTHE TALE \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nWE OPEN ON A WIDE SHOT OF THE ALLEY OUTSIDE THE STORE \nAt first it appears to be deserted, but we move to reveal a figure in an upper window of the apartment building which forms one side of the alley.  It's Kid Twist.  His eyes roam the street, for what, we do not yet know. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AN OLD DRUGSTORE ACROSS FROM THE ALLEY - DAY \nProbably prosperous at one time, it has since declined, its large fountain and eating area bow host to two bums and Hooker, who sits alone in a rear booth near the telephone. Dressed in a tuxedo, he nurses a cup of coffee, and anxiously alternates his glances between the clock and the empty street outside.  It's 12:52. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE STORE - DAY \nThe place is full of people, although we avoid long shot so as not to give away the room as a whole yet.  Instead, we concentrate on the tense, waiting faces of some of the more familiar people: \nGondorff and Niles in tuxedos behind a barred cashier's area. Gondorff mutilates a piece of gum in his mouth.  Niles just stares out into space cracking his knuckles. \nGONDORFF Eddie, cut that out, will ya. \nThe boardmarker walking nervously back and forth in front of his odds board, checking every letter and number.  He stops to cross a T on one of the horses' names.  It was already crossed, but he does it again anyway. \nBillie and Singleton, in an area hidden from the rest of the room, watching the print-out on the ticker machine.  The clicking of the ticker is the only sound we hear in the store. \nCurly Jackson in front of a mirror, pasting a fake Van Dyke on his chin to go with his tweed suit and monocle. \nA couple of Billie's girls adjusting their waitress outfits and primping their hair.  Each has a tray full of drinks beside her. \nThe Eirie Kid silently retracing his \"route\" to make sure he has it down. \nDespite the crowd, there is no talking and little movement, save for the constant swirling of smoke from several cigars and cigarettes.  The group is like a theatre company waiting to go on opening night. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DRUGSTORE AGAIN \nIt's 12:56 and Hooker is worried.  He looks up to see two large men, obviously racket goons, come in the front door, and take a seat facing him in the next booth.  They stare at him impassively, waving the waitress away when she comes to take their order.  Hooker knows they're Lonnegan's men, but is somewhat unsettled by the fact that Lonnegan is not with them.  Suddenly, a voice. \nVOICE Carver? \nHooker turns around to find that Lonnegan is seated in the booth directly behind him.  His bodyguard is in the one behind that. \nLONNEGAN You should always look to the back too, kid. \nHOOKER (sliding out of his booth and into Lonnegan's) I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time. \nLONNEGAN (curtly) Get on with it then. \nHOOKER (pointing to telephone) Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse. (pulling out a wad of bills) All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call. \nLONNEGAN You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet. \nHOOKER This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got. \nLONNEGAN And you were gonna pay me back? \nHOOKER I am after this race. \nLonnegan says nothing.  He's not sure he likes a man who's stupid enough to bet his last dollar on a horse race. \n", "test1_true": "EXT. STREET \nHooker hustles out across the street and into the alley. \nINT. DRUGSTORE \nLonnegan watches him through the window and then settles back in his seat to wait for the phone. \nOUTSIDE STORE \nAs Hooker descends the stairwell into the store, he gives Kid Twist the office.  Twist turns away from the window and looks at his watch.  12:58. \nCUT TO: \nDRUGSTORE \nLonnegan waiting by the phone, idly pinging a knife on the salt shaker.  It's 1:40.  A man enters the store and walks over to use the phone. \nLONNEGAN We're waitin' for a call. \nThe man looks at Lonnegan a second, and then at his four goons.  He decides maybe he'll make the call later. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE STORE \nKid Twist again.  Billie enters the room with a piece of paper.  Kid Twist looks at it a second and then picks up the pohne and begins to dial. \nINT. DRUGSTORE \nLonnegan again.  He's getting impatient now and lights a cigarette, and then the phone rings.  He answers it quickly and we hear: \nTWIST Bluenote at 6 to 1 on the nose. \nThe receiver clicks down at the other end.  Lonnegan hangs up and goes out the door, followed by his entourage. \nEXT. STREET \nWe follow him across the street and into the alley, where he signals one of the bodyguards to check the place out.  Kid Twist pushes a button on his window sill, and a buzzer goes off inside the store.  The previously inert figures there spring to life. \nLonnegan's bodyguard descends the stairwell and knocks at the door, where he is greeted by Hooker in the capacity of host.  He looks the place over and motions an okay to Lonnegan. \nINT. THE STORE \nAs Lonnegan enters, we see the room for the first time in its entirety.  Overnight it has been transformed into a swank private club, with bar, cigarette girls, upholstered furniture and chandeliers. \nSINGLETON Look at that.  He's got four apes with him. \nGONDORFF That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em. \nEverywhere there is activity.  A bank of telephones buzzes incessantly.  Sheet writers scurry from phone to phone, taking bets of tremendous size from prominent people. \nSHEET WRITER Yes, Mr. Ruth, 20,000 on Dancing Cloud. \nWe reveal that the phones are controlled by a master switch, which one of the recruited con men operates from behind a partition. \nThe boardmaker, wearing headphones suspended from a sliding wire, hurriedly chalks up races and odds on a huge blackboard. From the loudspeakers we hear the words \"last flash.\" The odds on Bluenote settle down to 8 to 1. \nLonnegan makes his way through the throng toward the betting line.  His bodyguards fan out to various positions in the room.  The betting crowd itself (known as the \"boost\") consists of close to twenty people, none of whom, of course are what they're pretending to be.  There are brokers with pasty faces, sportsmen, tanned and casual, and financiers with goatees and highly tailored clothes.  Large amounts of money are changing hands at the betting window.  Boodles are in sight everywhere. \nLonnegan slips into the betting line, feeling somewhat estranged from the general merriment around him.  There are two men in line ahead of him.  The first, Curly Jackson, slaps down several bundles of cash in front of Niles, who's the cashier, and places a $20,000 bet on War Eagle.  Gondorff appears at the cashier's window and catches sight of Lonnegan. \nGONDORFF Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan. \nLONNEGAN (piercingly) The name is Lonnegan. \nGONDORFF (to Niles) Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have. \nThe man in front of Lonnegan puts $5,000 on Dancing Cloud. He makes the bet on credit.  Lonnegan steps to the window. \nLONNEGAN Two-thousand on Bluenote. \nNILES (writing out a ticket) Is that all? \nLONNEGAN (pissed) That's all. \n", "test1_id": 1770, "test2_input": "Lonnegan laughs. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE WESTERN UNION OFFICE AGAIN - LATE AFTERNOON \nMr. Harmon is looking over the authorization papers that Twist and Singleton have given him.  He can't find anything wrong with it. \nHARMON Brigham signed it all right.  I can't understand why he didn't tell me. \nSINGLETON Ah, he's like all them supervisors. They think they're too good for regular people.  He says he was in here a while ago and the place was a mess. \nHarmon looks around, hoping it's not true. \nTWIST We'll try and hurry so we don't keep you out of your office too long. \nHARMON Why can't I work with you in there? \nSINGLETON Look pal, we gotta cover the floor, the furniture, everything, so we don't spill on nothing.  Now if you wanta sit in there with a tarp over your head, you're welcome to it. \nHARMON All right, how long will you be? \nTWIST Hour or two at the most.  We do good work. \nHarmon is resigned.  Twist and Singleton pick up their gear and march into the office.  Once inside, we notice that the office has an exit door which opens to an outside alley. Twist immediately removes his overalls, revealing the suit and tie he's wearing underneath.  He takes out a picture of himself, a woman and three small children, and puts it on Harmon's desk, replacing a similiar picture of Harmon's family.  Singleton, meanwhile, has spread a few tarps and begins to paint the walls. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE WESTERN UNION OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON \nLonnegan's car pulls up and stops across the street. \nHOOKER We'll go to the side door. \nWe follow Hooker and Lonnegan across the street to the side entrance which opens into: \nINT. HARMON'S OFFICE \nHooker knocks and Twist, of course, answers. \nHOOKER Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second. \nTWIST (irritated) What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'. \nHOOKER I thought it might be good for him to see the setup. \nTWIST (hushed) Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted. \nTwist walks over to the intercom on his desk.  He leaves the door open so that Lonnegan can get a good look at the office, Twist's picture in it, the painter, etc... Lonnegan's not missing any of it. \nTWIST (talking into the intercom) Miss Barnes, I'm going home a little early today.  Tell anyone that calls that they can reach me here in the morning.  Thank you. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRONT OFFICE \nHarmon's secretary at the other end of the intercom.  Mr. Harmon is with her.  They look at each other a second and Harmon decides he better see what's happening in his office. He opens the door to find it empty except for a pile of painting equipment and one haphazardly painted wall. \nCUT TO: \nINT. A DILAPIDATED CHINESE RESTAURANT - EVENING \nDark and somewhat foreboding, its peeling dragons and shoddy lanterns compete for space with the many slot machines and arcade games that line the walls.  Hooker, Lonnegan and Twist sit at one of the more secluded tables.  They are not eating. \nTWIST Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting. \nLONNEGAN I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to. \nTWIST But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back. \nLONNEGAN I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once. \nTWIST (stubbornly) On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got. \nLONNEGAN If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40. \n", "test2_true": "LONNEGAN With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40. \nTwist hesitates. \nLONNEGAN A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad. \nHOOKER He's right, Les. \nTWIST Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets. \nLONNEGAN Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya. \nHOOKER And what do we know about your guy. He says a week, but who knows if it's a month?  Lonnegan here's a banker.  He can get that dough with no questions asked. \nTwist says nothing for a minute, then: \nTWIST All right.  Be at the booth at 1:00. I'll give you all three places this time, Lonnegan.  That better be proof enough. \nHooker and Lonnegan smile at each other like life-long friends.  They get up to leave, and we frame the shot with a coffee cup large in the foreground.  As they go out the door, a black-gloved hand with four fingers enters the frame and puts a nickel down next to the cup. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nTHE SHUT-OUT \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nINT. A DOWNTOWN DINETTE - MORNING \nSnyder finishes a donut and a cup of coffee, puts down a dime for the lot and exits.  We follow him down the street: \nEXT. STREET \nTo a corner newsstand, where he stops to buy a morning paper. As he peruses it, he's approached by two large, clean-cut men in white skimmers. \nMAN Are you Lieutenant William Snyder? \nSNYDER I don't know, what's up? \nMAN F.B.I... The Captain'd like a few words with ya.  Ya got a couple minutes? \nSNYDER (completely floored) Yeh, sure. \nThe two men show him to a waiting car. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY \nSnyder stands in the middle of a dusty old machine room, surrounded by four or five Federal Agents.  Visible around the room are several folding cots and portable lockers.  The agents have obviously been quartered here temporarily.  They all wear white skimmers, save for one, a portly man, Captain Polk, who paces the room smoking.  There is something long- suffering about him, as if he wondered how he ever got in a service that thought white skimmers were classy. \nSNYDER What is this?  I got work to do. \nPOLK Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations. (not in the mood to screw around) We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker. \nSnyder doesn't answer. \nPOLK Do ya know him or don't ya? \nSNYDER Yeh, but I don't know where he is. \nPOLK Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells? \nSNYDER Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff. \nPOLK There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us. \nSNYDER Why don't you pick him up yourself? \nPOLK Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing. \nSNYDER Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got. \n", "test2_id": 1771, "test3_input": "THE STORE AGAIN \nNiles is busily spreading \"boodles\" all over the cashier's area.  Singleton checks his microphone.  It works fine.  He checks it again. \nCUT TO: \nLONNEGAN IN HIS LIMOUSINE \nHe holds the brief case in his lap, his fingers tapping lightly on it. \nCUT TO: \nTHE STORE AGAIN \nHooker and the gunman enter and go over to Gondorff, who breaks into a wide smile.  Hooker returns it halfheartedly, still ill at ease about what has happened. \nCUT TO: \nTHE F.B.I. CARS ON THEIR WAY \nThere are four or five driving in a column.  Snyder and Polk ride together in the back of the lead car. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THE DRUGSTORE - DAY \nLonnegan's limousine pulls up outside, and the bodyguards pile out. \nCUT TO: \nTHE STORE AGAIN \nGondorff, Hooker and the others waiting, the tension expressed in their faces. \nINT. THE DRUGSTORE - DAY \nLonnegan sits tensely in the usual booth.  He keeps both hands firmly planted on the brief case.  The phone rings and Lonnegan goes to it.  Music ends. \nVOICE Place it on Syphon at 8-1. \nLonnegan hangs up with the look of the financial killer. Eight to one odds is more than even he could have hoped for. \nEXT. STREET \nWe follow Lonnegan across the street and into the store. The bodyguards remain outside. \nINT. THE STORE \nThe store is buzzing with activity.  Money and booze are everywhere.  The sheet writer and the boardmarker can hardly keep up with the action.  Lonnegan walks quickly to the betting line and finds to his relief that there's only one man ahead of him.  The man puts $25,000 on King's Image. \nLonnegan steps to the window, swings up the brief case, and opens it for Niles to see. \nLONNEGAN (straight-faced) Five hundred grand on Syphon. \nNiles is struck dumb.  He's never seen that much money before. \nNILES (playing the flustered clerk) Hold on, I'll have to get the manager. \nNiles goes and returns with Gondorff. \nGONDORFF What's the problem? \nNILES (pointing to the brief case) He wants to put a half million on Syphon. \nGondorff looks at the money a second and then looks up at Lonnegan like he's gotta be crazy. \nGONDORFF (uneasily) I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us. \nLONNEGAN (challenging) If ya win it could make ya, too. \nGONDORFF (to Niles) What are the odds on Syphon? \nNILES Eight to one. \nGondorff looks at Lonnegan long and hard. \n", "test3_true": "LONNEGAN You're more gutless than I thought. \nThe words \"Last Flash\" are heard on the speaker.  Gondorff looks at Lonnegan with utter contempt.  He turns to Niles. \nGONDORFF (chopped) Take it. \nNiles hurriedly writes out a slip for 500,000 dollars. Lonnegan, allowing himself a sly smile, picks it up and retires to a nearby table.  He flashes a little okay sign to Hooker who acknowledges it with a nod. \nCALLER Ladies and gentlemen, this is Arnold Rowe, your caller for the San Antonio Handicap at Pimlico in Baltimore -- A mile and 1/16 for three-year-olds.  And they're off. \nLonnegan takes a deep breath and leans forward in his chair, the larceny boiling in his veins.  Hooker looks to Gondorff. Gondorff gives him the \"office.\" Hooker has to smile. \nCALLER And around the first turn it's King's Image by a neck, Syphon is second by one, Key to the Vault third by one half, followed by Mr. Moonlight, Red Ridge, Moneyman and No Charge. \nUnexpectedly, Kid Twist bursts in through the entrance. Barely able to control his enthusiasm, he hurries over to Lonnegan's table and sits down next to him. \nTWIST Sorry, but I just couldn't wait. Did everything go all right? \nLONNEGAN (motioning for him to keep his voice down) Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose. \nTWIST (in utter horror) On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second. \nLonnegan looks like he's just been stabbed.  He vaults over the table to the teller's window and grabs Niles. \nLONNEGAN You give me my goddamn money back! You hear me?  There's been a mistake! \nNILES I'm sorry, sir.  The betting's closed. \nLonnegan begins to shake him violently. \nLONNEGAN You give me my money back.  There's been a mistake, do you hear me? \nGondorff leaps to Niles' aid when suddenly there is a crash at the entrance door, and Polk, Snyder and eight federal agents burst into the room, guns drawn.  The place falls silent except for the loudspeaker, the members of the boost afraid to move.  Gondorff and Niles look at each other wondering how this could have possibly happened. \nPOLK (motioning to Hooker) All right, Hooker, you can go. \nHooker's eyes go to Gondorff, who looks back at him in utter disbelief, the betrayal raging in his features.  Hooker, unable to meet his gaze, lowers his head and starts to walk out.  Almost unnoticed, there's a flash of movement at Gondorff's belt.  A small gun.  A shot.  Hooker clutches his back and falls dead on the floor, the blood spurting from his mouth.  Polk, reacting instantly, pours four shots into Gondorff, who goes down in a heap.  Pandemonium breaks loose. The members of the boost race for the door.  Lonnegan is totally stunned.  First he lost his money and now he's involved in a murder.  Snyder rushes over to him. \nSNYDER C'mon.  We gotta get you outa here. \nEXT. STREET \nSnyder drags him through the crowd and out onto the street where an F.B.I. car is waiting.  His bodyguards have long since fled at the sight of the F.B.I. men. \nLONNEGAN My money's back there. \nSNYDER We'll worry about that later. \nSnyder gets in beside Lonnegan, and the car speeds away. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE STORE AGAIN \nThe pandemonium has now ceased.  Those who could escape have; the rest are lined up against the wall in frisking position.  Gondorff and Hooker lie on the floor dead.  The loudspeaker drones on.  Singleton is still calling the race from his booth, apparently oblivious to what's happened. \nCALLER And the winner is King's Image by four lengths, Syphon is second, by two, Moneyman third by two and one half.  Time for 1 and 1/16 miles, 1:21 and 2/10 seconds. \nPolk walks slowly over to Hooker's body and bends down. \nPOLK He's gone. \nHooker opens his eyes and slowly drags himself up off the floor, spitting out a little rubber bladder, filled with blood, that he's had in his mouth.  Gondorff does likewise. Niles, Twist, Singleton and the rest of the boost begin to laugh and shake hands, as do the Federal Agents. \nGONDORFF (to Polk) Nice con, Hickey.  I thought you were Feds myself, when you first came in. \nHICKEY No problem, Henry.  Snyder went for it all the way. (laughing) You shoulda seen the rag he lit under Lonnegan. \nGondorff turns to the others. \nGONDORFF Okay, let's take this place apart and get outa here.  You can get your splits from Eddie at Boudreau's tonight. \nGondorff walks over to Hooker, who's wiping the blood off his face and hands. \nGONDORFF You beat him, kid. \n", "test3_id": 1772}

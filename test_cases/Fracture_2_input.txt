BAILIFF The State of California Versus Thomas Crawford. The Defense rises; Crawford hardly pays any attention to the Judge - glancing back and noticing Nunally, whose eyes bore into him, haunted and burning. Crawford stares at him impassively a second, then turns to lean past his P.D. and watch Willy hastily skim the file. 
JUDGE Mr. Crawford, you've been charged with section 664 slash 187 of the California Penal Code: Attempted Murder, with additional allegations of Assault With a Deadly Weapon - Penal Code section 245 dash A2, with Great Bodily Injury, P.C. Section 12022.07. (Beat) Do you waive further reading of the complaint and complete statement of rights? 
P.D.                              CRAWFORD (sotto)                    I do.     But, your honor - You do. 
JUDGE FELDMAN And do you wish to enter a plea at this time? 
CRAWFORD Not guilty. But I also want to waive my right to counsel, and represent myself. Willy looks up from the file - startled. 
JUDGE FELDMAN Do you have a problem with your appointed counsel, Mr. Crawford? 
CRAWFORD No. I just want to do it myself.     I believe it's within my rights. 
P.D. Your honor, if I could have a moment with my client - 
CRAWFORD I'm not your client. Try and keep up, would you? The P.D. shuts up, taken aback. The Judge considers Crawford, thoughtful, then turns to Willy. 
JUDGE FELDMAN Do the People have an objection or a comment for the record, Mr. Slocum? Willy hesitates, held by Crawford's strange, amused gaze. Shakes it off: 
WILLY I'm sorry, your honor: we've got the weapon and a signed confession. I really think Mr. Crawford needs a competent attorney to - frankly - negotiate a plea. Crawford reaches up with cuffed hands and adjusts an imaginary bow-tie. Willy self-consciously touches where Crawford indicated on his own collar, straightens his clip- on. 
Crawford nods: you're welcome.    Willy turns to the Judge. 
WILLY I - can't - this was supposed to be - with a pro se defendant, this is going to drag out for months - and I'm not even going to be here. The People request a continuance to - 
CRAWFORD Excuse me? Your honor? I'm willing to waive my right to a preliminary hearing and go directly to a jury trial. (To Willy) Does that help? 
JUDGE You don't need to look out for Mr. Slocum, Mr. Crawford. The District Attorney's office can shift another prosecutor to the case - 
CRAWFORD No, I like Mr. Slocum. Beat. 
JUDGE FELDMAN Mr. Slocum?   He likes you. 
WILLY Terrific. 
JUDGE FELDMAN Mr. Crawford seems to understand his rights and responsibilities. 
WILLY All due respect, your honor, I'm worried this may turn into some sort of a - circus - 
JUDGE FELDMAN I appreciate your concern for the dignity of my courtroom, Mr. Slocum - considering you're making the argument dressed as a game-show host. Unfortunately, the man is a tax-paying citizen, entitled by our Constitution to try and manipulate the legal system, like everybody else. (turning) 
(MORE) 
JUDGE FELDMAN (cont'd) As for you, Mr. Crawford, I strongly urge you to retain counsel. Lack of same will not be grounds for appeal. 
CRAWFORD I understand.     Thank you. 
JUDGE FELDMAN Are the People ready to go to trial without a preliminary hearing? Willy hesitates, irritated. Looks through the file again. Checks Crawford - waiting, polite. 
WILLY Sure.   Why not. Crawford smiles at him, as the Judge opens her calendar. 
INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - LATER 
Willy, in his tux, comes out of a staircase and stops.   Rob Nunally is waiting by Willy's parked car. 
NUNALLY You're supposed to be good. Willy takes him in - wary, seeing an edge of anger and fear beneath the tough controlled cop manner. 
WILLY Is that what I'm supposed to be? 
NUNALLY I asked around. You're supposed to be top-notch - but to me it looks like you've got one foot out the door, and you're wiping the rest of us off the bottom of the other one.

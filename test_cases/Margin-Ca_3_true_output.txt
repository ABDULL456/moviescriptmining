SARAH ROBERTSON It's broken. 
JARED COHEN There are eight trillion dollars of paper around the world relying on that equation??

SARAH ROBERTSON We were wrong. 
JARED COHEN You mean you were wrong. 
SARAH ROBERTSON Don't even start.... This was discussed. 
SAM ROGERS I'm heading to the conference room. 
SARAH ROBERTSON No. 
JARED COHEN I'd like you to hear this. 
SAM ROGERS No... I don't want to hear this. 
SAM stares at them both. 
SAM ROGERS (cont'd) How do you think I've stuck around this place so long. 
He walks out of the room. SARAH and JARED look each other over. 
JARED COHEN I've called Tuld. 
SARAH ROBERTSON Is there a contingency plan here? 
JARED COHEN A contingency plan? 
SARAH ROBERTSON Yes. 
JARED COHEN We went all in on this one. 
SARAH ROBERTSON So we've got ourselves quite exposed here... haven't we? 
JARED COHEN To Tuld or the market? 
SARAH ROBERTSON Both. 
(CONTINUED) 40   CONTINUED: (3)                                                 40 
They both stare at each other. Jared's phone buzzes. He takes it out and his face says it all. 
SARAH ROBERTSON (cont'd) He's here. 
His face says yes. Sarah walks out. Jared stands up and straightens his tie in the reflection of the window. He exits. 
INT. OUTSIDE JARED'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

42   INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                      42 
They cut through a short cut near the freight elevator. WILL, PETER, and SETH are coming down the stairway from the roof. 
WILL EMERSON We were just grabbing a cigarette on the roof and a very spiffy looking helicopter dive-bombed us and then landed. 
JARED COHEN I know. Come with us. Where's Sam. 
WILL EMERSON I don't know. Do you want all of us> 
JARED COHEN Yes. 
JARED ushers the whole group towards the conference room. 
INT. OTHER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
All five walk in silence. Finally, 
JARED COHEN Just one piece of advice to everyone here before we go in there... this could get a bit ugly but whatever you do... just... tell the truth... don't try to change a word of it, no sugar coating... no one here is smart enough... including the rocket scientist.

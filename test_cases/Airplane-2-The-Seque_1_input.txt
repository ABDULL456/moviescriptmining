A banner hangs over terminal door:  "HOUSTON WELCOMES SPACE DISASTER PRESS." 
CLOSEUP OF ATTACHE CASE being carried to the door -- sticker on it reads, "NATIONAL ENQUIRER." 
CLOSEUP OF ANOTHER CASE coming from other direction -- sticker on it reads, "NATIONAL STAR." 
The cases meet.  LOOSEN to REPORTERS. 
ENQUIRER (to STAR) I never forget a face.  'Texas doctor claims sex with chicken cures baldness?' 
STAR 'Severed legs grow back after Utah man finds Christ?' 
ENQUIRER/STAR Long time no see. 
They shake hands and turn into the terminal. 
INT. MISSION CONTROL 
Controllers stand over Mr. Coffee -- everyone sips coffee and smokes cigarettes. 
MR. COFFEE (on radio) Have you got the back panel off the brew manifold? 
INT. CABIN 
Ted has the coffee machine apart, wears a headset and holds wires in pliars.  Anxious passengers with coffee cups stand over him -- they are all totally wired and going cold turkey. 
TED (into headset) Check. 
MR. COFFEE (V.O.) There's a terminal at the base of the coil.  That's your contact point. 
A PASSENGER bends down and picks a coffee bean off the floor. 
PASSENGER Is this a coffee bean? 
ALL PASSENGERS (maniacally) He's got a bean!! 
A riot ensues.  The "bean" Passenger is beaten to death. 
TED (into headset) It looks like the solder point has melted. 
INT. MISSION CONTROL 
MR. COFFEE (enraged) Just what I thought.  When the hell will you people realize that adding extra water after the initial brew cycle overheats the system!!  Now listen to me, Striker, and listen good. 
EXT. SHIP - SPACE 
It careens towards the sun. 
INT. MISSION CONTROL 
Detective Hallick storms in and up to McCrosky.  He flashes his badge. 
DETECTIVE HALLICK Who's in charge here, Mister? 
McCROSKY McCrosky, Control. 
DETECTIVE HALLICK Hallick, homicide. 
JACOBS Jacobs, Pisces. 
KRUGER Kruger, Sagittarius. 
COMMISSIONER Commissioner, Aquarius. 
DETECTIVE HALLICK We have information that one of your passengers is carrying a bomb and might be suicidal. 
McCROSKY Where'd you get this information, Captain? 
DETECTIVE HALLICK We have our methods. 
KRUGER And what methods are those? 
DETECTIVE HALLICK Have you heard of the Heimlich method? 
McCROSKY The method of saving someone choking on a piece of gristle? 
DETECTIVE HALLICK Exactly. 
KRUGER/McCROSKY/COMMISSIONER We're familiar with it. 
DETECTIVE HALLICK Good.  This is the passenger's wife.  Mrs. Joe Salucci. 
She approaches very distressed looking. 
McCROSKY What makes you think your husband might want to blow up that shuttle, ma'am? 
She goes into her purse for the insurance form. 
MRS. SALUCCI This insurance policy. 
A large ivory colored vibrator drops out of her purse, hits the floor, and flips on.  They all look at it. 
MRS. SALUCCI An electric tooth. (handing McCrosky the insurance form) Joey was supposed to go to Des Moines for an operation to cure his impotence. 
McCROSKY The Des Moines Institute? 
MRS. SALUCCI Then you know it. 
KRUGER/McCROSKY/COMMISSIONER Yes, we're familiar with it. 
MRS. SALUCCI Well, I found out Joey got on this shuttle instead and... 
DETECTIVE HALLICK The way I read it, blowin' up a plane in space leaves no traces, if you know what I mean.

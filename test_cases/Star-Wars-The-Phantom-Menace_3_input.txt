ANAKIN peeks over the edge of the cockpit to see BATTLE DROIDS surrounding the ship. He ducks back down. 
ANAKIN : Uh oh. This is not good. 
He looks at the dashboard to see red lights. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) The systems are still overheated, Artoo. 
The BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN walks up to the ship and sees ARTOO. 
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : Where's your pilot? 
ARTOO beeps a reply. 
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) You're the pilot? 
ARTOO whistles. 
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) Let me see your identification! 
ANAKIN sees the dashboard lights go from red to green. 
ANAKIN : Yes...we have ignition. 
He flips the switch and the engine starts. 
BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (seeing Anakin) You! Come out of there or we'll blast you! ANAKIN : Not if I can help it! Shields up! 
ANAKIN flips a switch and the ship levitates, knocking over the BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN. The OTHER DROIDS shoot, but the lasers are deflected by ANAKIN's shields. ARTOO beeeps. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) This should stop them. 
ANAKIN fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) ...and take this! 
He presses a button and launches two torpedos which miss the DROIDS. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Darn...I missed! 
The two torpedos fly down a hallway and explode inside the reactor room. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Let's get out of here! 
ANAKIN's ship roars through the hanger deck, bouncing over the DROIDS. 
ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee!

Stephanie and Ray eat ice cream cones as they walk past the shops.

STEPHANIE Let's get our fortune's read!

RHAM JAS I have the ability to see certain energies... Sometimes these ' energies are a foretoken of things to come. Sometimes not. Sixty dollars, please. 
RAY Sixty dollars? Isn't that a little steep for this kind of thing?

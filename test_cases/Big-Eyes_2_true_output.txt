CUT TO: 
INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - NIGHT 
Margaret is enthralled, avidly perusing a happy-looking booklet, "The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life." 
MARGARET It says here a worshiper of Jehovah must be honest in all things. Jane snorts. 
JANE I just can't believe you let people in the house. 
MARGARET I have nothing to hide! 
(TORRID) It also says no lies. "Speak truth. Let the stealer steal no more." Margaret and Jane lock eyes. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - DAY 
Loud JAZZ plays. Back home, Walter is living a Man's, Man's World. He's partying, drinking and dancing with two cute HIPPIE CHICKS in bikinis. The place is like a WAREHOUSE, Keane PRINTS stacked everywhere. 
HIPPIE CHICK Shit, this is crazy! All these copies... you're like Warhol! 
WALTER Nah, Warhol's like me. That fruitfly stole my act! "The Factory"? I had a factory before he had a soup can! The girls scrunch their faces, lost. Then -- DING-DONG! Walter peeks out the window, then grins. 
WALTER Ah! It's my art supplies. 
INT. PAINTING ROOM - SECONDS LATER 
Alone, Walter eagerly pries open a GIANT CRATE. He pulls out padding. Wadded Honolulu newspapers. Then... a PAINTING. Ah! A new WAIF, surrounded by colorful tropical plants. Walter smiles triumphantly -- until -- his happiness melts into confusion. Then horror. We ZOOM INTO the painting's SIGNATURE. It says "MDH Keane." Walter freaks. 
WALTER 
AAAGGGGHH! 
CUT TO: 
INT. HAWAIIAN KINGDOM HALL - DAY 
The JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES sing a joyous, high-spirited PSALM: 
JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES "Tremble not before your foe, Let all lovers of truth know! That my reigning Son, Christ Jesus, From the heav'ns has cast the foe. Soon will bind the Devil, Satan, Letting all his victims go!" Margaret and Jane are singing happily. 
INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY 
Margaret pours her liquor down the sink. Margaret tosses her cigarettes in the trash. Margaret swells, feeling a burst of power. Then a VOICE: 
D.J. (O.S.) Oh yeah! We got a special guest today. A world-famous celebrity who just called up and asked to come in..! 
INT. RADIO BOOTH - DAY 
Angle on BIG LOLO, a gregarious Hawaiian D.J. in headphones. 
D.J. She's malihini! Moved to the islands a couple months ago... so let's give a big aloha to Margaret Keane! He pops in a cart. Canned APPLAUSE plays. We reveal across from him... Margaret. He grins. 
D.J. So is it true your husband Walter is the top-selling painter in the world? We SLOWLY PUSH IN to her. Tentative, she speaks. 
MARGARET No... Big Lolo. Everything you just said is false. Margaret takes a deep breath. Working up her courage. 
MARGARET One: Walter is no longer my husband. (a long pause) And Two: He's not... a painter. Margaret exhales. The D.J. is confused. He checks his notes. 
D.J. But, am I... mixed-up? Ain't he the guy who does the crazy eyes? 
MARGARET No. Though he's been taking credit for ten years. 
(STRONG) I'm the only painter in the family. Margaret slowly smiles. And then... a calmness comes over her. Like a cloud has lifted. 
INT. RADIO STATION HALLWAY - DAY 
Margaret and Jane walk away. Jane beams proudly, then gives her mother a warm hug. Then -- LOUD CLICKING:

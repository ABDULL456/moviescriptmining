INCREDIBLE \nIs this on? \nINTERVIEWER \nThat's fine. \nMR. INCREDIBLE \nI can break through walls, I just can't... \nINTERVIEWER \nThat's fine. \nMR. INCREDIBLE \nI can't get this on. \nINTERVIEWER \nSo, Mr. Incredible...do you have a secret identity? \nMR. INCREDIBLE \nEvery superhero has a secret identity. I don't know a single one who doesn't. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time? \nELASTIGIRL \nOf course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, y'know what I mean? \nFROZONE \nSuperladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret identity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something like that. I said, ''Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego.'' or anything like that. I mean, you tell me you're a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good. \nMR. INCREDIBLE \nNo matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved, you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. ''I just cleaned up this mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?'' \nINTERVIEWER \nI could get to that point. \nMR. INCREDIBLE \n''Please?'' \nINTERVIEWER \nWait, no, don't get up. We're not finished. \nMR. INCREDIBLE \nSometimes l think I'd just like the simple life, you know? Relax a little and raise a family. \nELASTIGIRL \nSettle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game! I'm right up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don't think so. I don't think so. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nPOLICE RADIO \nWe interrupt for an important bulletin. A deadly high-speed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway, traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nYeah, I've got time. \nOLD LADY \nMr. lncredible. Um, Mr. Incredible... \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nWhat is it, ma'am? \nOLD LADY \nMy cat, Squeaker, won't come down. \n[cat meows] \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nCertainly, ma'am but I suggest you stand clear. There could be trouble. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nIs the night still young? \nLUCIUS (FROZONE) \nYou're very late. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nHow do I look? Good? \nLUCIUS (FROZONE) \nOh, the mask! You still got the mask. \n[cracks neck] \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nShowtime. \nPRIEST \nRobert Parr, will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nYou're late. When you asked me if I was doing anything later, I didn't realize you'd actually forgotten. I thought it was playful banter. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nIt was playful banter. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nCutting it kinda close, don't you think? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nYou need to be more... flexible. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nI love you, but if we're gonna make this work, you've gotta be more than Mr. lncredible. You know that. Don't you? \nPRIEST \n...so long as you both shall live? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nI do. \nPRIEST \nI pronounce this couple husband and wife. \n[people cheering and whistling] \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nAs long as we both shall live. No matter what happens. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nHey, come on. We're superheroes. What could happen? \nANNOUNCER \nIn a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for saving someone who, apparently, didn't want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet, who was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed suit against the famed superhero in Superior Court. \nSANSWEET'S LAWYER \nMr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved. Mr. Sansweet didn't want to be saved. And the injury received from Mr. Incredible ''actions'', so quote, causes him daily pain. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nHey, I saved your life! \nSANSWEET \nYou didn't save my life! You ruined my death, that's what you did! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nListen-- \nMR. INCREDIBLE'S LAWYER \nMy client has no further comment at this time. \nANNOUNCER \nFive days later, another suit was filed by victims of the el train accident. Incredible's court losses cost the government millions. And opened the flood gates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over. \nWOMAN \nIt is time for their secret identity to become their only identity. Time for them to join us, or go away. \nANNOUNCER \nHoney! \nBOB \nGreat. First the car, now I gotta pay to fix the table... \nHELEN \nThe car? What happened to the car? \nBOB \nHere. I'm getting a new plate. \nHELEN \nSo, how about you, Vi? How was school? \nVIOLET \nNothing to report. \nHELEN \nYou've hardly touched your food. \nVIOLET \nI'm not hungry for meatloaf. \nHELEN \nWell, it is leftover night. We have steak, pasta. What are you hungry for? \nDASH \nTony Rydinger. \nVIOLET \nShut up! \nDASH \nWell, you are. \nVIOLET \nI said, shut up, you little insect! \nDASH \nWell, she is. \nHELEN \nDo not shout at the table. Honey! \nBOB \nKids! Listen to your mother. \nDASH \nShe'd eat if we were having Tony loaf. \nVIOLET \nThat's it! \nHELEN \nStop it! \nDASH \nYou're gonna be toast! \nHELEN \nStop running in the house. Sit down! \nDASH \nOw! Hey, no force fields! \nVIOLET \nYou started it. \nHELEN \nYou sit down! You sit down! Violet! \nBOB \n''Simon J. Paladino, longtime advocate of superhero rights, is missing''? Gazerbeam. \nHELEN \nBob! It's time to engage. Do something! Don't just stand there! I need you to intervene! \nBOB \nHe starts monologuing. \nLUCIUS \nHe starts monologuing! He starts like this prepared speech about how feeble I am compared to him. How inevitable my defeat is, how the world will soon be his! Yada, yada, yada. \nBOB \nYammering. \nLUCIUS \nYammering! I mean, the guy has me on a platter, and he won't shut up. \nPOLICE RADIO \nMuniciberg, we have a 23-56... \nBOB \n23-56, what is that? Robbery? \nLUCIUS \nThis is just sad. \nBOB \nYeah, robbery. Want to catch a robber? \nLUCIUS \nNo. Tell you the truth, I'd rather go bowling. Look, what if we actually did what our wives think we're doing? Just to shake things up. \nWOMAN \nHe's not alone. The fat guy's still with him. They're just talking. \nLUCIUS \nWhat are we doing here, Bob? \nBOB \nProtecting people. \nLUCIUS \nNobody asked us. \nBOB \nYou need an invitation? \nLUCIUS \nI'd like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this, and...you remember Gazerbeam? \nBOB \nYeah. There was something about him in the paper. \nLUCIUS \nHe had trouble adjusting to civilian life, too. \nBOB \nWhen's the last time you saw him? \nLUCIUS \nI don't see anyone from the old days, Bob. Just you. And we're pushing our luck as it is. \nBOB \nOh, come on. \nLUCIUS \nIt was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this, we're gonna get-- \nPOLICE RADIO \nWe have a report on a fire... \nBOB \nA fire. We're close! [yelling] Yeah, baby! \nLUCIUS \nWe're gonna get caught. \nBOB \nWoohoo! Haha!\u00a0 Fire! Yeah! \nLUCIUS \nIs that everybody? \nBOB \nLUCIUS \nThat was way too close. We are not doing that again. \nMAN \n[over radio] Verify you want to switch targets? Over. \nWOMAN \nTrust me. This is the one he's been looking for. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nHELEN \nI thought you'd be back by 11 . \nBOB \nI said I'd be back later. \nHELEN \nI assumed you'd be back later. lf you came back at all...you'd be ''back later''. \nBOB \nWell, I'm back, okay? \nHELEN \nIs this rubble? \nBOB \n[with mouth full] It was just a little workout. Just to stay loose. \nHELEN \nYou know how I feel about that, Bob. Darn you! We can't blow cover again! \nBOB \nThe building was coming down anyway. \nHELEN \nWhat?! You knocked down a building?! \nBOB \nIt was on fire. Structurally unsound. It was coming down anyway. \nHELEN \nTell me you haven't been listening to the police scanner again? \nBOB \nLook, I performed a public service. You act like that's a bad thing. \nHELEN \nIt is a bad thing, Bob! Uprooting our family again, so you can relive the glory days is a very bad thing. \nBOB \nReliving the glory days is better than acting like they didn't happen! \nHELEN \nYes! They happened! But this, our family, is what's happening now, Bob. And you are missing this! I can't believe you don't want to go to your own son's graduation. \nBOB \nIt's not a graduation. He's moving from the fourth grade to the fifth grade. \nHELEN \nIt's a ceremony! \nBOB \nIt's psychotic! They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity but if someone is genuinely exceptional... \nHELEN \nThis is not about you, Bob. This is about Dash. \nBOB \nYou want to do something for Dash? Then let him actually compete. Let him go out for sports! \nHELEN \nI will not be made the enemy here! You know why we can't do that. \nBOB \nBecause he'd be great! \nHELEN \nDid I do something illegal? \nMR. HUPH \nNo. \nBOB \nAre you saying we shouldn't help our customers? \nMR. HUPH \nThe law requires that I answer no. \nBOB \nWe're supposed to help people. \nMR. HUPH \nWe're supposed to help our people! Starting with our stockholders, Bob. Who's helping them out, huh? You know, Bob, a company... \nBOB \nIs like an enormous clock. \nMR. HUPH \n...is like an enormous clo--yes. Precisely. It only works if all the little cogs mesh together. Now, a clock needs to be cleaned, well-lubricated and wound tight. The best clocks have jewel movements, cogs that fit, that cooperate by design. [chuckling] I'm being metaphorical, Bob. You know what I mean by cooperative cogs? Bob? Bob? Look at me when I'm talking to you, Parr! \nBOB \nThat man out there, he needs help. \nMR. HUPH \nDo not change the subject, Bob. We're discussing your attitude! \nBOB \nHe is getting mugged! \nMR. HUPH \nWell, let's hope we don't cover him. \nBOB \nI'll be right back. \nMR. HUPH \nStop right now or you're fired! Close the door. Get over here, now. \nMR. HUPH \nI'm not happy, Bob. Not happy. \nBOB \nHe got away. \nMR. HUPH \nGood thing, too. You were this close to losing your jo-- \nBOB \nUh-oh. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nBOB \nHow is he? \nRICK \nHe'll live. \nBOB \nI'm fired, aren't I? \nRICK \nOh, you think? \nBOB \nWhat can I say, Rick? \nRICK \nNothing you haven't said before. \nBOB \nSomeone was in trouble. \nRICK \nSomeone's always in trouble. \nBOB \nUh-oh. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nHELEN \nYou are one distracted guy. \nBOB \nHmm? Am I? I don't mean to be. \nHELEN \nI know you miss being a hero and your job is frustrating. I just want you to know how much it means to me that you stay at it anyway. \nBOB \nHoney? About the job? \nHELEN \nWhat? \nBOB \nSomething's happened. \nHELEN \nWhat? \nBOB \nThe, uh... \nHELEN \nWhat? \nBOB \nThe company is sending me to, uh, a conference. \nHELEN \nA conference? \nBOB \n[stammering] Out of town. And I'm just gonna be gone for a few days. \nHELEN \nThey've never sent you to a conference before. This is good, isn't it? \nBOB \n[hesitating] Yes. \nHELEN \nYou see? They're finally recognizing your talents. You're moving up. \nBOB \nYes. \nHELEN \nHoney! This is wonderful! \nBOB \nYes, it is. \n[phone ringing] \nMIRAGE [over phone] \nHello? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nThis is Mr. lncredible. I'm in. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nMIRAGE \nThe Omnidroid 9000 is a top secret prototype battle robot. lts artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem it's confronted with. And, unfortunately... \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nLet me guess. It got smart enough to wonder why it had to take orders. \nMIRAGE \nWe lost control. And now it's loose in the jungle, threatening our facility. We've had to evacuate all personnel from the island for their own safety. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nI prefer to think of it as misunderstood. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \n[chuckling] Aren't we all? \nMIRAGE \nVolcanic soil is among the most fertile on Earth. Everything at the table was grown right here. How does it compare? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nEverything's delicious. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nBOB \nJeez. \nHELEN \nHurry, honey. Or you'll be late for work. \nHELEN \nHave a great day, honey. \nBOB \nThanks. \nHELEN \nHelp customers, climb ladders... \nBOB \nBring bacon? \nHELEN \nAll that jazz. \nGUARD \nYou have an appointment? \nBOB \nI'm an old friend. I just wanted to... \nGUARD \nAll visitors are required to make a reser-- \nE \n[shoos the guard away] Get back to work! Go check the electric fence or something! What is it? Who are you? What do you want? \nE \nMy God, you've gotten fat. Come in. Come, come. \nE \nYes, things are going quite well. Quite well. My God, no complaints. But, you know, it is not the same. Not the same at all. \nBOB \nWeren't you just in the news? Some show in Prayge... Prague? \nE \nMilan, darling. Milan. Supermodels. Ha! Nothing super about them. Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures with poofy lips who think only about themselves. Feh! I used to design for gods. But perhaps you come with a challenge, eh? I was surprised to get your call. \nBOB \nE, I just need a patch job. \nE \nHmm. This is megamesh. Outmoded, but very sturdy. And you've torn right through it! What have you been doing, Robert? Moonlighting hero work? \nBOB \nMust have happened a long time ago. \nE \nI see. This is a hobo suit, darling. You can't be seen in this. I won't allow it! Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now? \nBOB \nWhat do you mean? You designed it. \nE \nI never look back, darling. It distracts from the now. You need a new suit. That much is certain. \nBOB \nA new suit? Where the heck am I gonna get a new suit? \nMIRAGE \nSee you there. \nBOB \nGoodbye. \nHELEN \nWho was that, honey? The, uh, office? \nBOB \nAnother conference. Short notice, but you know...duty calls. [nervous laugh] \nHELEN \nBob? \nBOB \nYeah, what's up, honey? \nHELEN \nHa... have a great trip. \nBOB \nThanks, sweetie. I'll call you when I get there. \nHELEN \nI love you. So much. \nBOB \nI love you too. \nCOMPUTER \nThis is your automated Captain. Would you care for more mimosa? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nDon't mind if I do. Thanks. \nCOMPUTER \nYou're welcome. \nCOMPUTER \nCurrently 78 degrees in Nomanisan. Perfect weather for flying. \nCOMPUTER \nPlease fasten your seat belt. We're beginning our descent. \nMIRAGE \nHello, Mr. lncredible. Nice suit. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nThanks. Nice to be back, Mirage. \nMIRAGE \nYou'll be briefed on your assignment in the conference room at two. D Wing, room A-113. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \n2:00. Got it. \nMIRAGE \nSee you there. \nHELEN \n[gasps] Edna. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nHELEN \nI'd like to speak to Edna, please. \nE \nThis is Edna. \nHELEN \nE? This is Helen. \nE \nHelen who? \nHELEN \nHELEN \nHey, Snug. Thanks for getting back. I know this is short notice, but I was hoping that I could get you to... \nVIOLET \nWhat are these? \nDASH \nLook, I'm The Dash! The Dash likes. \nHELEN \nJust a second. Take that off before somebody sees it. \nVIOLET \nBut you're packing one just like it. Are you hiding something? \nHELEN \nOh, please, honey. I'm on the phone...Dash! \nDASH \nYikes! This is yours. It's specially made. \nVIOLET \nWhat's going on? \nHELEN \nYou're not coming! And I've gotta pack! \nVIOLET \nWhat makes you think it's special? \nDASH \nI don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it? \nHELEN \nSnug, I'm calling in a solid you owe me. \nSNUG [over phone] \nWhat do you need? \nHELEN \nA jet. What do you got that's fast? \nSNUG \nLet me think... \n__________________________________________SCENE \nHELEN \nIsland approach. India Golf niner-niner checking in. VFR on top. Over. \n[radio static] \nHELEN \nIsland tower, this is India Golf niner-niner requesting vectors to the initial. Over. \n[radio static] \nHELEN \nEasy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl. You're overreacting. Everything's fine. They're just all getting coffee. At the same time. Yeah. \nSYNDROME \nYou sir, truly are ''Mr. lncredible''! You know, I was right to idolize you. I always knew you were tough, but tricking the probe by hiding under the bones of another super? Oh, man! I'm still geeking out about it! [sighs] And then you had to just go and ruin the ride. I mean, Mr. lncredible calling for help? [mocking] ''Help me, help me.'' Lame, lame, lame, lame, lame! All right, who did you contact?! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nContact? What are you talking about? \nSYNDROME \nI am referring to last night at 2307 hours while you were snooping around. You sent out a homing signal. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nI didn't know about the homing device. \nSYNDROME \nAnd now a government plane is requesting permission to land here! Who did you contact?! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nI didn't send for a plane. \nSYNDROME \nVIOLET \nBut you said we weren't supposed to use our powers. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nI know what I said! Listen to what I'm saying now! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nDisengage. Repeat, disengage! \nDASH \nMom? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nViolet! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nMayday, mayday! India Golf niner-niner is buddy-spiked! Abort! Abort! There are children aboard, say again, there are children aboard! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nNo! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \n[to Violet] Put a field around us now! \nVIOLET \nI've never done one that big! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nViolet, do it now! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nAbort, abort, abort! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nAbort, abort, abort! \n[all screaming] \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nBrace yourselves! \nVIOLET/DASH \nMom! Mom! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nEverybody calm down. Now, I'll tell you what we're not gonna do. We're not gonna panic, we're not gonna--look out! \nDASH/VIOLET \n- Oh, my God! Who's idea was this anyway?! \n- What are we gonna do?! What are we gonna do?! \nDASH \nWe're dead! We're dead! \nVIOLET \nIt blew up! \nDASH \nWe survived but we're dead! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nStop it! We are not gonna die! Now both of you will get a grip. Or so help me I will ground you for a month! Understand? \nMIRAGE \nWe have a confirmed hit. Target was destroyed. \nSYNDROME \nAh, you'll get over it. I seem to recall you prefer to ''work alone''. [evil laughter] \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nRelease me...now! \nSYNDROME \nOr what? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nI'll crush her. \nMom! Mom, what happened on the plane. I'm sorry. [stammering] I wanted to help. I mean, when you asked me to... I'm sorry. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nShh. It isn't your fault. It wasn't fair for me to suddenly ask so much of you. But things are different now. And doubt is a luxury we can't afford anymore, sweetie. You have more power than you realize. Don't think. And don't worry. lf the time comes, you'll know what to do. It's in your blood. \nMIRAGE \nHe's not weak, you know. \nSYNDROME \nWhat? \nMIRAGE \nValuing life is not weakness. \nSYNDROME \nOh, hey. Look, look...if you're talking about what happened in the containment unit, I had everything under control. \nMIRAGE \nAnd disregarding it is not strength. \nSYNDROME \nI called his bluff, sweetheart, that's all. I knew he wouldn't have it in him to actually... \nMIRAGE \nNext time you gamble, bet your own life! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nOkay, okay, okay. \n[voices on radio] \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nA rocket? \n[sighs, gasps] \nGUARD \nHey! \n[struggling] \nDASH \nWell, not that this isn't fun, but I'm gonna go look around. \nVIOLET \nWhat do you think is going on here? You think we're on vacation or something? Mom and Dad's lives could be in jeopardy. Or worse, [whispering] their marriage. \nDASH \nTheir marriage? So, the bad guys are trying to wreck Mom and Dad's marriage. \nVIOLET \nOh, forget it. You're so immature. \nDASH \nOkay, I'm gonna go look around. \nVIOLET \nMom said to stay hidden. \nDASH \nI'm not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh! \n[voices over radio] \nDASH \n[echoing] Cool! \nDASH \n[echoing] Cool! \n[over radio] Roger. We are ready for launch. \nDASH \nVi, Vi! \nVIOLET \nWhat did you do? \n[over radio] ETA two-niner. Over. TCI clear. Condition yellow. Status norm. \n[over radio] Not responding to IFF. IRCM reads negative. \nHelen? \nMIRAGE \nHello. You must be Mrs. Incre-- \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nShe was helping me to escape. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nNo. That's what I was doing. Let go of me! Let go, you lousy, lying, unfaithful creep! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nHow could I betray the perfect woman? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nOh, you're referring to me now? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nWhere are the kids? \nMIRAGE \nThey might've triggered the alert. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nWhat?! \nMIRAGE \nSecurity's been sent into the jungle. You better get going. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nNow our kids are in danger?! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nlf you suspected danger, why'd you bring them? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nI didn't bring 'em, they stowed away. And I don't think you're not striking the proper tone here! \nGUARD \nThink they're supers? \nVIOLET \nDash, remember what Mom said. \nDASH \nWhat? \nGUARD 2 \nHey! Stop talking! \nGUARD 3 \nHold it! Freeze! \nVIOLET \nDash, run! \nDASH \nWhat? \nVIOLET \nRun! \nDASH \nOh yeah! \nGUARD \nWhat the--?! They're supers! \nGUARD 2 \nGet the boy! Show yourself! \n[spitting] \n[Dash screams] \nGUARD \nHey! \nDASH \nHuh? Huh? Oh, come on! You gotta admit, this is cool. Just like a movie! The robot will emerge dramatically, do some damage. Throngs of screaming people! And just when all hope is lost, Syndrome will save the day! I'll be a bigger hero than you ever were! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nYou mean you killed off real heroes so that you could pretend to be one? \nSYNDROME \nOh, I'm real. Real enough to defeat you! And I did it without your precious gifts, your oh-so-special powers. I'll give them heroics. I'll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen! And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my inventions so that everyone can be superheroes. Everyone can be super. And when everyone's super...no one will be. [evil laughter] \n[soldiers shouting] \nSOLDIER \nFire at will! \n- [on TV] It's completely overwhelming the tanks. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nI'm sorry. This is my fault. I've been a lousy father. Blind to what I have. So obsessed with being undervalued that I undervalued all of you. \nDASH \nUm..dad? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nShh. Don't interrupt. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nSo caught up in the past that I...You are my greatest adventure. And I almost missed it. I swear, I'm gonna get us out of this safely if I... \nVIOLET \nWell, I think Dad has made some excellent progress today but I think it's time we wind down now. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nWe need to get back to the mainland. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nI saw an aircraft hangar on my way in. Straight ahead, I think. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nWhere are all the guards? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nGo, go! \nGUARD \nHey, look. Hey! Every time they run, you take a shot. \nGUARD 2 \nYeah, okay. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nThis is the right hangar, but I don't see any jets. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nA jet's not fast enough. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nWhat's faster than a jet? \nDASH \nHey, how about a rocket? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nGreat! I can't fly a rocket. \nVIOLET \nYou don't have to. Use the coordinates from the last launch. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nWait. I bet Syndrome's changed the password by now. How do I get into the computer? \nMIRAGE \nSay please. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nLUCIUS (FROZONE) \nHoney? \nHONEY \nWhat? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nKids, strap yourselves down like I told you! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nHere we go, honey! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nReady, Violet? Ready? Now! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nThis is gonna be rough! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nThe robot's in the financial district. Which exit do I take? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nTraction Avenue. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nThat'll take me downtown. I take Seventh, don't I? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nDon't take Seventh! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nGreat, we missed it! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nYou asked me how to get there and I told you. Exit at Traction! \nBOB (MR.

The baby is sleeping. You took away my future. I'm simply returning the favor. Oh, don't worry, I'll be a good mentor. Supportive, encouraging. Everything you weren't.

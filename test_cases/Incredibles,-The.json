INCREDIBLE \nIs this on? \nINTERVIEWER \nThat's fine. \nMR. INCREDIBLE \nI can break through walls, I just can't... \nINTERVIEWER \nThat's fine. \nMR. INCREDIBLE \nI can't get this on. \nINTERVIEWER \nSo, Mr. Incredible...do you have a secret identity? \nMR. INCREDIBLE \nEvery superhero has a secret identity. I don't know a single one who doesn't. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time? \nELASTIGIRL \nOf course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, y'know what I mean? \nFROZONE \nSuperladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret identity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something like that. I said, ''Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego.'' or anything like that. I mean, you tell me you're a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good. \nMR. INCREDIBLE \nNo matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved, you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. ''I just cleaned up this mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?'' \nINTERVIEWER \nI could get to that point. \nMR. INCREDIBLE \n''Please?'' \nINTERVIEWER \nWait, no, don't get up. We're not finished. \nMR. INCREDIBLE \nSometimes l think I'd just like the simple life, you know? Relax a little and raise a family. \nELASTIGIRL \nSettle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game! I'm right up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don't think so. I don't think so. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nPOLICE RADIO \nWe interrupt for an important bulletin. A deadly high-speed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway, traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nYeah, I've got time. \nOLD LADY \nMr. lncredible. Um, Mr. Incredible... \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nWhat is it, ma'am? \nOLD LADY \nMy cat, Squeaker, won't come down. \n[cat meows] \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nCertainly, ma'am but I suggest you stand clear. There could be trouble. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nThanks, but I don't need any help. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nWhatever happened to ''ladies first''? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nWell, whatever happened to equal treatment? \nTHIEF \nHey, look, the lady got me first. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nWell, we could share, you know. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nI work alone. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nWell, I think you need to be more...flexible. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nAre you doing anything later? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nI have a previous engagement. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \n[whistles] \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nNow, you just stay here. They usually pick up the garbage in an hour. \nLUCIUS (FROZONE) \nHey, lncredible! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nHey, Frozone! \nLUCIUS (FROZONE) \nShouldn't you be getting ready? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nI still got time. \n[crowd screaming] \nWOMAN \nHe's gonna jump! \nSANSWEET \nI think you broke something. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nWith counseling, I think you'll come to forgive me. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nWait a minute. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \n[coughing] Bomb Voyage. \nVOYAGE \n[French] Mr. Incredible! \nBUDDY (INCREDIBOY) \nAnd lncrediBoy! \nVOYAGE \nlncrediBoy? \nBUDDY (INCREDIBOY) \nHey, hey! Aren't you curious about how I get around so fast? See? I have these rocket boots-- \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nGo home, Buddy. \nBUDDY (INCREDIBOY) \nHELEN \nYou saw him do this? \nBERNIE \nWell...not really. No. Actually, not. \nHELEN \nOh, then how do you know it was him? \nBERNIE \nI hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I've got him. See? You see? You don't see it? He moves! Right there! Wait, wait! Right there! Right as I'm sitting down! I don't know how he does it, but there's no tack before he moves and after he moves, there's a tack. Coincidence? I think not! \nPRINCIPAL \nBernie... \nBERNIE \nDon't ''Bernie'' me. [screaming] This little rat is guilty! \nPRINCIPAL \nYou and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the trouble. \nBERNIE \nYou're letting him go again? He's guilty! You can see it on his smug little face. Guilty, I say, guilty! \nHELEN \nDash, this is the third time this year you've been sent to the office. We need to find a better outlet. A more...constructive outlet. \nDASH \nMaybe I could, if you'd let me go out for sports. \nHELEN \nHoney, you know why we can't do that. \nDASH \nI promise I'll slow up. I'll only be the best by a tiny bit. \nHELEN \nDashiell Robert Parr, you are an incredibly competitive boy. And a bit of a showoff. The last thing you need is temptation. \nDASH \nYou always say, ''Do your best.'' But you don't really mean it. Why can't I do the best that I can do? \nHELEN \nRight now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else. \nDASH \nDad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of. Our powers made us special. \nHELEN \nEveryone's special, Dash. \nDASH \nWhich is another way of saying no one is. \nBOY \nHey, Rydinger. Where you headed? \nGIRL \nHi, Tony. \nTONY \nHey. \nBOY \nHey, Tony, can I carry your books? \nTONY \nThat's kind of funny. \nBOY 1 \nHey, Tony, do you play football? \nBOY 2 \nTony, I thought we were gonna go swimming. \nVIOLET \nHe looked at me. \nHoney! \nBOB \nGreat. First the car, now I gotta pay to fix the table... \nHELEN \nThe car? What happened to the car? \nBOB \nHere. I'm getting a new plate. \nHELEN \nSo, how about you, Vi? How was school? \nVIOLET \nNothing to report. \nHELEN \nYou've hardly touched your food. \nVIOLET \nI'm not hungry for meatloaf. \nHELEN \nWell, it is leftover night. We have steak, pasta. What are you hungry for? \nDASH \nTony Rydinger. \nVIOLET \nShut up! \nDASH \nWell, you are. \nVIOLET \nI said, shut up, you little insect! \nDASH \nWell, she is. \nHELEN \nDo not shout at the table. Honey! \nBOB \nKids! Listen to your mother. \nDASH \nShe'd eat if we were having Tony loaf. \nVIOLET \nThat's it! \nHELEN \nStop it! \nDASH \nYou're gonna be toast! \nHELEN \nStop running in the house. Sit down! \nDASH \nOw! Hey, no force fields! \nVIOLET \nYou started it. \nHELEN \nYou sit down! You sit down! Violet! \nBOB \n''Simon J. Paladino, longtime advocate of superhero rights, is missing''? Gazerbeam. \nHELEN \nBob! It's time to engage. Do something! Don't just stand there! I need you to intervene! \nBOB \nHe starts monologuing. \nLUCIUS \nHe starts monologuing! He starts like this prepared speech about how feeble I am compared to him. How inevitable my defeat is, how the world will soon be his! Yada, yada, yada. \nBOB \nYammering. \nLUCIUS \nYammering! I mean, the guy has me on a platter, and he won't shut up. \nPOLICE RADIO \nMuniciberg, we have a 23-56... \nBOB \n23-56, what is that? Robbery? \nLUCIUS \nThis is just sad. \nBOB \nYeah, robbery. Want to catch a robber? \nLUCIUS \nNo. Tell you the truth, I'd rather go bowling. Look, what if we actually did what our wives think we're doing? Just to shake things up. \nWOMAN \nHe's not alone. The fat guy's still with him. They're just talking. \nLUCIUS \nWhat are we doing here, Bob? \nBOB \nProtecting people. \nLUCIUS \nNobody asked us. \nBOB \nYou need an invitation? \nLUCIUS \nI'd like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this, and...you remember Gazerbeam? \nBOB \nYeah. There was something about him in the paper. \nLUCIUS \nHe had trouble adjusting to civilian life, too. \nBOB \nWhen's the last time you saw him? \nLUCIUS \nI don't see anyone from the old days, Bob. Just you. And we're pushing our luck as it is. \nBOB \nOh, come on. \nLUCIUS \nIt was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this, we're gonna get-- \nPOLICE RADIO \nWe have a report on a fire... \nBOB \nA fire. We're close! [yelling] Yeah, baby! \nLUCIUS \nWe're gonna get caught. \nBOB \nWoohoo! Haha!\u00a0 Fire! Yeah! \nLUCIUS \nIs that everybody? \nBOB \nLUCIUS \nThat was way too close. We are not doing that again. \nMAN \n[over radio] Verify you want to switch targets? Over. \nWOMAN \nTrust me. This is the one he's been looking for. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nHELEN \nI thought you'd be back by 11 . \nBOB \nI said I'd be back later. \nHELEN \nI assumed you'd be back later. lf you came back at all...you'd be ''back later''. \nBOB \nWell, I'm back, okay? \nHELEN \nIs this rubble? \nBOB \n[with mouth full] It was just a little workout. Just to stay loose. \nHELEN \nYou know how I feel about that, Bob. Darn you! We can't blow cover again! \nBOB \nThe building was coming down anyway. \nHELEN \nWhat?! You knocked down a building?! \nBOB \nIt was on fire. Structurally unsound. It was coming down anyway. \nHELEN \nTell me you haven't been listening to the police scanner again? \nBOB \nLook, I performed a public service. You act like that's a bad thing. \nHELEN \nIt is a bad thing, Bob! Uprooting our family again, so you can relive the glory days is a very bad thing. \nBOB \nReliving the glory days is better than acting like they didn't happen! \nHELEN \nYes! They happened! But this, our family, is what's happening now, Bob. And you are missing this! I can't believe you don't want to go to your own son's graduation. \nBOB \nIt's not a graduation. He's moving from the fourth grade to the fifth grade. \nHELEN \nIt's a ceremony! \nBOB \nIt's psychotic! They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity but if someone is genuinely exceptional... \nHELEN \nThis is not about you, Bob. This is about Dash. \nBOB \nYou want to do something for Dash? Then let him actually compete. Let him go out for sports! \nHELEN \nI will not be made the enemy here! You know why we can't do that. \nBOB \nBecause he'd be great! \nHELEN \nDid I do something illegal? \nMR. HUPH \nNo. \nBOB \nAre you saying we shouldn't help our customers? \nMR. HUPH \nThe law requires that I answer no. \nBOB \nWe're supposed to help people. \nMR. HUPH \nWe're supposed to help our people! Starting with our stockholders, Bob. Who's helping them out, huh? You know, Bob, a company... \nBOB \nIs like an enormous clock. \nMR. HUPH \n...is like an enormous clo--yes. Precisely. It only works if all the little cogs mesh together. Now, a clock needs to be cleaned, well-lubricated and wound tight. The best clocks have jewel movements, cogs that fit, that cooperate by design. [chuckling] I'm being metaphorical, Bob. You know what I mean by cooperative cogs? Bob? Bob? Look at me when I'm talking to you, Parr! \nBOB \nThat man out there, he needs help. \nMR. HUPH \nDo not change the subject, Bob. We're discussing your attitude! \nBOB \nHe is getting mugged! \nMR. HUPH \nWell, let's hope we don't cover him. \nBOB \nI'll be right back. \nMR. HUPH \nStop right now or you're fired! Close the door. Get over here, now. \nMR. HUPH \nI'm not happy, Bob. Not happy. \nBOB \nHe got away. \nMR. HUPH \nGood thing, too. You were this close to losing your jo-- \nBOB \nUh-oh. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nBOB \nHow is he? \nRICK \nHe'll live. \nBOB \nI'm fired, aren't I? \nRICK \nOh, you think? \nBOB \nWhat can I say, Rick? \nRICK \nNothing you haven't said before. \nBOB \nSomeone was in trouble. \nRICK \nSomeone's always in trouble. \nI prefer to think of it as misunderstood. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \n[chuckling] Aren't we all? \nMIRAGE \nVolcanic soil is among the most fertile on Earth. Everything at the table was grown right here. How does it compare? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nEverything's delicious. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nBOB \nJeez. \nHELEN \nHurry, honey. Or you'll be late for work. \nHELEN \nHave a great day, honey. \nBOB \nThanks. \nHELEN \nHelp customers, climb ladders... \nBOB \nBring bacon? \nHELEN \nAll that jazz. \nGUARD \nYou have an appointment? \nBOB \nI'm an old friend. I just wanted to... \nGUARD \nAll visitors are required to make a reser-- \nE \n[shoos the guard away] Get back to work! Go check the electric fence or something! What is it? Who are you? What do you want? \nE \nMy God, you've gotten fat. Come in. Come, come. \nE \nYes, things are going quite well. Quite well. My God, no complaints. But, you know, it is not the same. Not the same at all. \nBOB \nWeren't you just in the news? Some show in Prayge... Prague? \nE \nMilan, darling. Milan. Supermodels. Ha! Nothing super about them. Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures with poofy lips who think only about themselves. Feh! I used to design for gods. But perhaps you come with a challenge, eh? I was surprised to get your call. \nBOB \nE, I just need a patch job. \nE \nHmm. This is megamesh. Outmoded, but very sturdy. And you've torn right through it! What have you been doing, Robert? Moonlighting hero work? \nBOB \nMust have happened a long time ago. \nE \nI see. This is a hobo suit, darling. You can't be seen in this. I won't allow it! Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now? \nBOB \nWhat do you mean? You designed it. \nE \nI never look back, darling. It distracts from the now. You need a new suit. That much is certain. \nBOB \nA new suit? Where the heck am I gonna get a new suit? \nMIRAGE \nSee you there. \nBOB \nGoodbye. \nHELEN \nWho was that, honey? The, uh, office? \nBOB \nAnother conference. Short notice, but you know...duty calls. [nervous laugh] \nHELEN \nBob? \nBOB \nYeah, what's up, honey? \nHELEN \nHa... have a great trip. \nBOB \nThanks, sweetie. I'll call you when I get there. \nHELEN \nI love you. So much. \nBOB \nI love you too. \nCOMPUTER \nThis is your automated Captain. Would you care for more mimosa? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nDon't mind if I do. Thanks. \nCOMPUTER \nYou're welcome. \nCOMPUTER \nCurrently 78 degrees in Nomanisan. Perfect weather for flying. \nCOMPUTER \nPlease fasten your seat belt. We're beginning our descent. \nMIRAGE \nHello, Mr. lncredible. Nice suit. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nThanks. Nice to be back, Mirage. \nMIRAGE \nYou'll be briefed on your assignment in the conference room at two. D Wing, room A-113. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \n2:00. Got it. \nMIRAGE \nSee you there. \nHELEN \n[gasps] Edna. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nHELEN \nI'd like to speak to Edna, please. \nE \nThis is Edna. \nHELEN \nE? This is Helen. \nE \nHelen who? \nHELEN \nYes, words are useless. Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble! Too much of it, darling. Too much! That is why I show you my work. That is why you are here. \nE \nEdna Mode. And guest. \nE \nCome. Sit. \nE \nCream and sugar? \nHELEN \nThanks. \nE \nI started with the baby. \nHELEN \nStarted? \nE \nShh! Darling! Shh! I cut it a little roomy for the free movement. The fabric is comfortable for sensitive skin, and can also withstand a temperature of over 1000 degrees. Completely bulletproof. And machine washable, darling. That's a new feature. \nHELEN \nWhat on earth do you think the baby will be doing?! \nE \nWell, I'm sure I don't know, darling. Luck favors the prepared. I didn't know the baby's powers, so I covered the basics. \nHELEN \nJack-Jack doesn't have any powers. \nE \nNo? Well, he'll look fabulous anyway. \nE \nYour boy's suit I designed to withstand enormous friction without heating up or wearing out. A useful feature. \nE \nYour daughter's suit was tricky. But I finally created a sturdy material that will disappear completely as she does. \nE \nYour suit can stretch as far as you can, without injuring yourself, and still retain its shape. Virtually indestructible...yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton. As an extra feature, each suit contains a homing device, giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a button. Well, darling? What do you think? \nHELEN \nWhat do I think? Bob is retired! I'm retired! Our family is underground. You helped my husband resume secret hero work behind my back?! \nE \nWell, I assumed you knew, darling. Why would he keep secrets from you? \nHELEN \nHe wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't. \nE \nMen at Robert's age are often unstable. Prone to weakness. \nHELEN \nWhat are you saying? \nE \nDo you know where he is? \nHELEN \nOf course. \nE \nDo you know where he is? \n__________________________________________SCENE \n[voices, static on radio] \n[electric fizzling] \n[grunt] \n[voice on radio] \nGUARD 1 \nHey, hey. We got a man down! \nVIOLET \nBut you said we weren't supposed to use our powers. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nI know what I said! Listen to what I'm saying now! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nDisengage. Repeat, disengage! \nDASH \nMom? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nViolet! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nMayday, mayday! India Golf niner-niner is buddy-spiked! Abort! Abort! There are children aboard, say again, there are children aboard! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nNo! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \n[to Violet] Put a field around us now! \nVIOLET \nI've never done one that big! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nViolet, do it now! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nAbort, abort, abort! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nAbort, abort, abort! \n[all screaming] \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nBrace yourselves! \nVIOLET/DASH \nMom! Mom! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nEverybody calm down. Now, I'll tell you what we're not gonna do. We're not gonna panic, we're not gonna--look out! \nDASH/VIOLET \n- Oh, my God! Who's idea was this anyway?! \n- What are we gonna do?! What are we gonna do?! \nDASH \nWe're dead! We're dead! \nVIOLET \nIt blew up! \nDASH \nWe survived but we're dead! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nStop it! We are not gonna die! Now both of you will get a grip. Or so help me I will ground you for a month! Understand? \nMIRAGE \nWe have a confirmed hit. Target was destroyed. \nSYNDROME \nAh, you'll get over it. I seem to recall you prefer to ''work alone''. [evil laughter] \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nRelease me...now! \nSYNDROME \nOr what? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nI'll crush her. \nMom! Mom, what happened on the plane. I'm sorry. [stammering] I wanted to help. I mean, when you asked me to... I'm sorry. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nShh. It isn't your fault. It wasn't fair for me to suddenly ask so much of you. But things are different now. And doubt is a luxury we can't afford anymore, sweetie. You have more power than you realize. Don't think. And don't worry. lf the time comes, you'll know what to do. It's in your blood. \nMIRAGE \nHe's not weak, you know. \nSYNDROME \nWhat? \nMIRAGE \nValuing life is not weakness. \nSYNDROME \nOh, hey. Look, look...if you're talking about what happened in the containment unit, I had everything under control. \nMIRAGE \nAnd disregarding it is not strength. \nSYNDROME \nI called his bluff, sweetheart, that's all. I knew he wouldn't have it in him to actually... \nMIRAGE \nNext time you gamble, bet your own life! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nOkay, okay, okay. \n[voices on radio] \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nA rocket? \n[sighs, gasps] \nGUARD \nHey! \n[struggling] \nDASH \nWell, not that this isn't fun, but I'm gonna go look around. \nVIOLET \nWhat do you think is going on here? You think we're on vacation or something? Mom and Dad's lives could be in jeopardy. Or worse, [whispering] their marriage. \nDASH \nTheir marriage? So, the bad guys are trying to wreck Mom and Dad's marriage. \nVIOLET \nOh, forget it. You're so immature. \nDASH \nOkay, I'm gonna go look around. \nVIOLET \nMom said to stay hidden. \nDASH \nI'm not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh! \n[voices over radio] \nDASH \n[echoing] Cool! \nDASH \n[echoing] Cool! \n[over radio] Roger. We are ready for launch. \nDASH \nVi, Vi! \nVIOLET \nWhat did you do? \n[over radio] ETA two-niner. Over. TCI clear. Condition yellow. Status norm. \n[over radio] Not responding to IFF. IRCM reads negative. \nHelen? \nMIRAGE \nHello. You must be Mrs. Incre-- \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nShe was helping me to escape. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nNo. That's what I was doing. Let go of me! Let go, you lousy, lying, unfaithful creep! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nHow could I betray the perfect woman? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nOh, you're referring to me now? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nWhere are the kids? \nMIRAGE \nThey might've triggered the alert. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nWhat?! \nMIRAGE \nSecurity's been sent into the jungle. You better get going. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nNow our kids are in danger?! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nlf you suspected danger, why'd you bring them? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nI didn't bring 'em, they stowed away. And I don't think you're not striking the proper tone here! \nGUARD \nThink they're supers? \nVIOLET \nDash, remember what Mom said. \nDASH \nWhat? \nGUARD 2 \nHey! Stop talking! \nGUARD 3 \nHold it! Freeze! \nVIOLET \nDash, run! \nDASH \nWhat? \nVIOLET \nRun! \nDASH \nOh yeah! \nGUARD \nWhat the--?! They're supers! \nGUARD 2 \nGet the boy! Show yourself! \n[spitting] \n[Dash screams] \nGUARD \nHey! \nDASH \nHuh? Huh? Oh, come on! You gotta admit, this is cool. Just like a movie! The robot will emerge dramatically, do some damage. Throngs of screaming people! And just when all hope is lost, Syndrome will save the day! I'll be a bigger hero than you ever were! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nYou mean you killed off real heroes so that you could pretend to be one? \nSYNDROME \nOh, I'm real. Real enough to defeat you! And I did it without your precious gifts, your oh-so-special powers. I'll give them heroics. I'll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen! And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my inventions so that everyone can be superheroes. Everyone can be super. And when everyone's super...no one will be. [evil laughter] \n[soldiers shouting] \nSOLDIER \nFire at will! \n- [on TV] It's completely overwhelming the tanks. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nI'm sorry. This is my fault. I've been a lousy father. Blind to what I have. So obsessed with being undervalued that I undervalued all of you. \nDASH \nUm..dad? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nShh. Don't interrupt. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nSo caught up in the past that I...You are my greatest adventure. And I almost missed it. I swear, I'm gonna get us out of this safely if I... \nVIOLET \nWell, I think Dad has made some excellent progress today but I think it's time we wind down now. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nWe need to get back to the mainland. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nI saw an aircraft hangar on my way in. Straight ahead, I think. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nWhere are all the guards? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nGo, go! \nGUARD \nHey, look. Hey! Every time they run, you take a shot. \nGUARD 2 \nYeah, okay. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nThis is the right hangar, but I don't see any jets. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nA jet's not fast enough. \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nWhat's faster than a jet? \nDASH \nHey, how about a rocket? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nGreat! I can't fly a rocket. \nVIOLET \nYou don't have to. Use the coordinates from the last launch. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nWait. I bet Syndrome's changed the password by now. How do I get into the computer? \nMIRAGE \nSay please. \n__________________________________________SCENE \nLUCIUS (FROZONE) \nHoney? \nHONEY \nWhat? \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nKids, strap yourselves down like I told you! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nHere we go, honey! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nReady, Violet? Ready? Now! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nThis is gonna be rough! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nThe robot's in the financial district. Which exit do I take? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nTraction Avenue. \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nThat'll take me downtown. I take Seventh, don't I? \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nDon't take Seventh! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nGreat, we missed it! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nYou asked me how to get there and I told you. Exit at Traction! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nThat'll take me downtown! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nHe's coming up! Get in the right lane! Signal! \nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) \nNot Traction! \nHELEN (ELASTIGIRL) \nYou're gonna miss it! \nBOB (MR.

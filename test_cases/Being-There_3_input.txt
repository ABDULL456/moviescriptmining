EVE (approaches Chance, calls) Chauncey! 
CHANCE (stops, turns) Hello, Eve. 
EVE Your leg must be getting better. 
CHANCE Yes. It's feeling much better now. 
EVE Good. I'm glad to hear that. (they walk together) ... How did you like meeting the President? 
CHANCE Fine. He's very nice. 
EVE Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him. 
They walk along in silence for a moment. Chance sees a huge greenhouse not far from them, heads toward it. Eve turns to him, hesitates, then questions. 
EVE (CONT'D) ... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died. 
CHANCE Yes. 
EVE Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend? 
CHANCE (looking at greenhouse) He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young. 
EVE Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps? 
CHANCE (quizzically) ... Mentor...? 
Eve takes his uncertainty as a reluctance to discuss the Old Man. 
EVE Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him. 
CHANCE Yes. I was. 
EVE I'm sorry... (getting more to the point) ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also? 
CHANCE Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid. 
EVE (relieved) Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with. 
CHANCE Oh, no. She brought me my meals. 
EVE (pleased) Of course. 
Eve edges slightly closer to Chance. Chance edges slightly closer to the greenhouse, is fascinated by it. 
CHANCE What is that? 
EVE Our greenhouse. 
CHANCE (pleased) Oh, I like that very much. 
EVE Yes, so do we. 
Chance peeks through one of the windows. 
INT. RAND'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Rand is in bed. Eve, Chance and Allenby are seated around him, the two nurses standing to one side. They all watch the President's address to the Financial Institute on TV. Chance inhales deeply, enjoys the oxygen in the room. Rand is looking weaker. Every so often, Allenby casts a concerned glance his way. 
PRESIDENT'S VOICE ... And there are so many of you that have proclaimed that we are on the brink of the worst financial crisis in this nation's history. And there are so many of you demanding that we put into effect drastic measures to alter its course. Well, let me tell you, gentlemen, I have been conducting multiple-level consultations with members of the Cabinet, House and Senate. I have conducted meetings with prominent business leaders throughout the country. And this very morning I had an in-depth discussion with your founder and Chairman-Of-The-Board, Mr. Benjamin Turnbull Rand and his close friend and advisor Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... 
Rand perks up a bit at this mention. Allenby manages a smile, once again looks at Rand, checking his condition. Eve looks proudly at Chance, who continues to enjoy the oxygen. 
PRESIDENT'S VOICE (CONT'D) ... Well, gentlemen, I found this to be a most rewarding conference... To quote Mr. Gardiner, a most intuitive man, 'As long as the roots of industry remain firmly planted in the national soil, the economic prospects are undoubtedly sunny.' 
Rand starts coughing, breathing heavily. Allenby and the nurses rush to his bedside. Allenby shoots a quick look to Eve and Chance. 
ALLENBY (motioning toward door) Excuse us, please. 
Eve and Chance leave the room as Allenby administers aid to Rand. 
PRESIDENT'S VOICE Gentlemen, let us not fear the inevitable chill and storms of autumn and winter, instead, let us anticipate the rapid growth of springtime, let us await the rewards of summer. As in a garden of the earth, let us learn to accept and appreciate the times when the trees are bare as well as the times when we pick the fruit. 
EXT. RAND MANSION - PATIO - DAY 
Eve and Chance sit in silence on the patio. Eve's eyes are swollen, red, she has been crying. She turns to Chance, reaches out, touches his hand.

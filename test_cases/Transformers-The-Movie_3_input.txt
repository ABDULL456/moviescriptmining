With that, the four Dinobots head towards the "primrose path." 
ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON 
His head rotates and he smiles a sinister, evil smile. 
EXT. UNICRON 
Galvatron stands upon the demonic planet, in an extremely contorted position. 
GALVATRON Why do you torture me?! 
VARIOUS ANGLES ON UNICRON 
We have no idea where this godly voice is coming from, but this place sure is spooky. 
UNICRON You have failed. 
GALVATRON No, Unicron. Ultra Magnus is dead. 
UNICRON Then where is the matrix? 
GALVATRON Destroyed, with him. 
UNICRON The matrix can not be destroyed. (pause) And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of Junk. Stalk him. Cut him open! And bring the matrix to me. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE PRIMROSE PATH 
They step along the primrose path, not noticing as sinister things start to happen all around them. 
ANGLE ON A METAL EATING PLANT 
This thing looks like a metal version of a "venus fly trap," and it has a malevolent red eye which lights up. Swoop walks past it in humanoid mode. 
SNAP! 
It misses him by an inch. 
GRIMLOCK Me Grimlock, positive Hot Rod and Kup close! Get thump, thump, thump... (taps his head hard) 
ANGLE ON THE GROUND - IN FRONT OF SLAG 
Suddenly, a section of stones drop away in front of Slag revealing a spiked pit... 
SLAG Me, Slag say you are full of beryllium balony. He is just about to fall in when... 
ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK AND SLAG 
Grimlock, in dino mode, slaps him with his tail, knocking him away an instant before he steps into the hole... 
GRIMLOCK Me, Grimlock, say you full of cesium salami! Slag gets up... 
SLAG Beryllium balony! 
GRIMLOCK Argh! 
ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK 
He is about to pounce on Slag when a massive tree, which is actually more like a sword, suddenly is spring and arcs toward him. The machete like blade strikes the ground, between Grimlock and Slag narrowly missing them. He turns and sees the thing stocking in the ground. 
GRIMLOCK Me, Grimlock think trees here are cheap model. 
SLAG Like your head! (laughs at own joke) Grimlock jumps on Slag and wrestles him to the ground. Suddenly, a SQUEAKY, ODDLY CHILDISH VOICE speaks from o.s. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SQUEAKY VOICE (WHEELIE) Friends find. Look behind. 
GRIMLOCK (furious) Who say that? 
HIS P.O.V. - WHEELIE 
WHEELIE is the Wolf Boy of Quintesson - an Autobot who's been evading the Sharkticons since his parents' ship crashed, killing everybody else in his party. He wears a necklace of Sharkticon teeth, packs a three bladed laser knife and a special SLING which hurls FIRE STONES. He fears nothing, especially the Dinobots, and he cockily struts into the clear... ... walks right up Sludge's tail onto Sludge's back and then shinnies up his neck and jumps onto... ... Slag's head where he stands eye to eye with Grimlock 
WHEELIE Friends find. Look behind.   Many Face lie. You fool! You buy! 
GRIMLOCK AND WHEELIE 
GRIMLOCK (eyes blaze, furious) Me, Grimlock, "fool?" 
WHEELIE (smiling breezily) Picture you got. Now fool you not! (he laughs in a wild, metallic cackle) Grimlock raises a claw to swipe Wheelie off Slag's head 
GRIMLOCK Me, Grimlock, no like you! 
ON WHEELIE as he scowls and quickly loads FIRESTONE IN SLING and slings it onto Grimlock's nose where it EXPLODES making Grimlock yowl and pull back, feeling his reddened nose and speaking through his nose angrily 
GRIMLOCK (continuing) Doooooooow! Why boy hit by dose? 
(CONTINUED)

REGGIE (shouting) Hola!  Senor Farragut!  We meet again. 
Johnnie goes over to Reggie and Drop Shadow and shakes hands. 
JOHNNIE I thought you two were in Austin, Texas.  Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts. 
DROP SHADOW We were.  Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning. 
REGGIE Would you like to enjoy a martini with us? 
JOHNNIE Why not?  How was the fishin? 
REGGIE I think they are too serious, these American fishermen.  In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method. 
Reggie orders martinis for the three of them. 
JOHNNIE So, its back to the islands. 
DROP SHADOW Yes.  Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting. 
REGGIE Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened. 
JOHNNIE This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place. 
REGGIE (laughs) It has its moments of uncertainty. 
DROP SHADOW But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut? 
JOHNNIE Call me Johnnie...  N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in. 
REGGIE I can tell you are an intelligent man, Johnnie.  One difference between your country and mine is that in the islands, it does not pay to reveal ones intelligence...  Others may use what they perceive against us... 
Reggie raises his glass to Johnnies. 
REGGIE Hasta siempre. 
JOHNNIE Hasta siempre. 
REGGIE Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland? 
JOHNNIE Hows that? 
DROP SHADOW Two Scotsmen were fighting over a penny. 
Johnnie finishes off his martini. 
JOHNNIE I gotta admit, you guys are (sliding off the stool) two in four dozen. 
REGGIE The real joke is we never went fishing, but were still fishing. 
Johnnie squints his eyes thinking about this one.  Reggie and Drop Shadow smile and stand to leave. 
CUT TO: 
96. INT. THUNDERBIRD - STREETS OF NUNEZ - NIGHT 
Lula and Sailor cruise the dark streets. 
LULA I wouldnt mind a little night life. How about you? 
SAILOR Hard to tell whats shakin in a place like this, honey.  You dont want to be walkin in the wrong door. 
LULA Maybe theres a place we could hear some music.  I feel like dancin. We could ask someone. 
97. EXT. RED DEVIL GAS STATION - NIGHT 
Sailor spots a Red Devil gas station that still has its lights on and pulls the car over. 
SAILOR Someone up here might know somethin. 
Two skinny, pimply-faced guys, BUCK and BILLY, wearing dirty coveralls walk over to them. 
BUCK Gas? 
SAILOR Got enough, thanks.  Were lookin for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin - get somethin to eat, too.  Anything like that around here? 
BILLY Cornbreads.  They got western. 
BUCK No food, though, cept bar nibbles. 
Lula slides over in the front seat and leans across to Sailor. 
LULA How about speed metal? 
The kids look worried and take a step back. 
LULA Any kinda rocknroll, honey. 
BILLY Theres a boogie joint just about a mile straight out Lafitte here.  But thats a black place mostly. 
BUCK Mostly black though in that boogie place. 
SAILOR Whats the name of it?

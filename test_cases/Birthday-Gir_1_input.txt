NADIA What are you doing here? 
John and Nadia look at each other. 
ALEXEI What the fuck is he doing here? 
He looks at the little gun. 
ALEXEI That's that cigarette lighter I gave you isn't it? 
Alexei stands. John takes a step back. Alexei walks calmly towards John and throws a punch. It catches John right on the chin and he hits the wall and goes down very fast. 
NADIA Stop. 
Alexei turns round to see Nadia holding the knife. He is dumbstruck. 
ALEXEI What? What are you doing? 
NADIA (to John) What are you doing here? 
Alexei kicks John in the ribs. 
NADIA (in Russian) Stop it! 
He looks at Nadia, the girl he came back for, angrily pointing the knife at him. He suddenly looks completely punctured. John has struggled up again and stands behind him. They are both looking at Nadia. 
ALEXEI What. You're what? You're with this creep now. 
NADIA Leave him! 
ALEXEI You have. You've actually fallen for this prick. 
NADIA No I haven't. 
Alexei looks dumbstruck. He laughs emptily 
ALEXEI Babe it's me. I won't let you get away. 
Nadia stares back at him. The seconds pass. She speaks in a whisper. 
NADIA I'll kill you if you try. 
In the impasse, John picks up a lamp and hurls it at Alexei's head. It is going to hit him, but reaches the length of its cord and stops six inches short. In the confusion. Alexei grabs Nadia's wrist and forces her to the ground. He grabs the knife, just as John brains him with one of the guitars. It emits a fruity final chord. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR / ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT 
Whistling, Yuri comes out of his suite, knocks briskly on the door of Alexei's and enters. We walk with him down the hallway into the bedroom to find Alexei, heartbroken, tied and bound to a desk chair. 
Yuri murmurs something in Russian. 
SUBTITLE Fuck a duck. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT 
Nadia stands at the window and stares at her reflection, or past it into the blackness. 
NADIA Get their passports. 
John finishes tying up Yuri, and removes his passport from his jacket. Behind Nadia another plane arcs up into the night sky. 
He takes Alexei's passport from his pocket, but Alexei is only watching Nadia. 
ALEXEI Don't do this. 
She carefully places tape across his mouth. 
Almost as if having second thoughts she bends down to kiss his cheek. The 'kiss' suddenly makes Alexei's eyes widen in pain. As she stands her lips are bloody. She's bitten him on the cheek. A single streak of blood runs from the gash. 
NADIA (to John) Get your money.

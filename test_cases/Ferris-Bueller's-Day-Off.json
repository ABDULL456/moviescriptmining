AN AURAL TOUR OF A HOUSE ON A SCHOOL MORNING. BEGINING IN THE KITCHEN AND MOVING UPSTAIRS. \nFATHER'S VOICE (TOM) Where's my wallet?! \nSEVEN YEAR OLD BOY (TODD) YOU IDIOT!! \nTWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL (KIMBERLY) MOM! \nTODD SHUT-UP! \nEIGHTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL (JEANIE) I NEED A TOWEL!! \nTOM JOYCE! \nKIMBERLY (whispers, sadistic) When you turn ten, your head's going to swell up real big like a watermelon and we're going to have to put you to sleep like they do with a dog. \nTODD MOM! \nTOM JOYCE!! \nJEANIE WHO PISSED ON THE TOILET SEAT!? MOTHER!! \nTOM Where's Mom? \nTODD Is my head going to swell up? \nTOM What?! \nJEANIE OH, MY GOD! THE TOILET PAPER'S ALL WET!!! \nMOTHER (JOYCE) (screams) TOM! \nThe house falls dead SILENT. We hear footsteps thundering through the house. A TENSE STRAIN OF MUSIC FADES UP. \nTODD What's that? \nKIMBERLY Wait! Hold still! \nTODD What?! \nKIMBERLY You heads starting to swell up!! \nTodd screams. We hear the sound of Tom's footsteps running through the kitchen, down the hall, up the stairs, up the hallway. A door open. \nTOM (breathless) What's the matter? \nJOYCE (worried) It's Ferris! \nTOM What's wrong? \nJOYCE (snaps) What's wrong? For Christ's sake! Look at him! \n2  CLOSE-UP. FERRIS                                              2 \nAn eighteen year-old boy. He's staring lifelessly at CAMERA. His mouth's open. His eyes are bugged-out. His tongue is fat and dry in his mouth. He's laying in bed, on his side. \n3  INT. BOY'S BEDROOM                                            3 \nFerris' parents, TOM and JOYCE BUELLER are standing at bedside. They're in their late forties, early fifties. Handsome, upper-middle class parents. They're both dressed for work. \nTOM Ferris? \nJOYCE He doesn't have a fever. But he says his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots. \n4  CLOSE-UP. FERRIS                                              4 \nHis lifeless eyes blink. \n5  INT. BEDROOM. PARENTS                                         5 \nTom bends down and touches Ferris' forehead. \nTOM What's the matter, Ferris? \nJOYCE Feel his hands. They're cold and clammy. \nTom takes one of Ferris' hands. \nTOM (discreetly) Should you call the doctor? \nJOYCE (whispers) He doesn't want me to. \nTOM Why don't you want Mom to call the doctor? \nFerris exhales loudly. He tries to speak but all he can manage is a choked gasp. \nTOM What? \nFerris tries again. \nHe turns from the window. \nFERRIS Parents always fall for the clammy hands. It's physical evidence of illness. It's a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are generally pretty hip to the fever scams. And to make them work you have to go a hundred and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous mother and you end up in a doctor's office and that's worse than school. \nHe flips on his stereo and fills the room with the MTV broadcast. A NEW SONG begins. \nFERRIS Fake a stomach cramp and when you're doubled over, moaning and wailing, just lick your palms. It's a little stupid and childish but then so if high school. Right? \nHe equalizes the sound a little. \nFERRIS This is my ninth sick day with semester. If I go for ten, I'm probably going to have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely must make this one count. \nHe exits into the hallway. \n11  INT. BATHROOM                                                11 \nFerris walks into the bathroom. It's littered with Jean's debris. He turns on the shower water. \nFERRIS I don't care if you're fifty five or seven, everybody needs a day off now and then. It's a beautiful day. How can I be expected to handle high school? \nHe bends down OUT OF FRAME as he loses his briefs. He pops up. \nFERRIS I do actually have a test. That wasn't bullshit. \nHe steps into the shower. Through the pebbled glass of the shower door we see Ferris' outline. \nFERRIS That I care about it was. \n12  INT. BATHROOM. SHOWER STALL.                                 12 \nInside the shower. Ferris' hair is standing straight up. It's moulded into a fin with shampoo. \nFERRIS It's on European socialism. I mean, really. What's the point? I'm not European. I don't plan to be European. So, who gives a shit if they're socialists? They could be fascist anarchists and it still wouldn't change the fact that I don't own a car. \nHe turns the shower head around and uses it like a microphone. \nFERRIS (sings) WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY, TWIST AND SHOUT... \n13  INT. HALLWAY. LATER                                          13 \nFerris comes out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist. He's drying his hair with another of a different color. \nFERRIS Not that I condone fascism. Or and \"isms\". \"Isms\", in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an \"ism\". He should believe in himself. John Lennon said it on his first solo album. \"I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me.\" A good point there. Afterall, he was the Walrus. \nHe opens a linen closet and tosses the towel in it. \nFERRIS I could be the Walrus and I'd still have to bum rides off people. \nHe passes CAMERA and goes into his room. \nFERRIS (OC) I'm not very political? Let me put that into perspective... \n14  INT. BEDROOM                                                 14 \nFerris tosses the towel he's dried hair with on the bed. \nFERRIS My uncle went to Canada to protest the war, right? On the Fourth of July he was down with my aunt and he got drunk and told my Dad he felt guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam. So I said, \"What's the deal, Uncle Jeff? In wartime you want to be a pacifist and in peacetime you want to be a soldier. It took you twenty years to find out you don't believe in anything?\" (snaps his fingers) Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks. (pause) Be careful when you deal with old hippies. They can be real touchy. \nHe opens his door. \n15  INT. CLOSET                                                  15 \nThe door opens and Ferris rifles through his shirts. \nFERRIS My mother was a hippie. But she lost it. She got old. If she listens to the White Album now? She doesn't hear music, she hears memories. Nostalgia is her favorite drug. It'll probably be mine, too. I hope not. \nHe finds a shirt he likes. He steps back from the closet and puts it on. He drops the towel. \n16  INT. BEDROOM                                                 16 \nHe walks across the room to his dresser. He opens his underwear drawer. There's an old model of a submarine on the top of the dresser. He picks it up. \nFERRIS In eighth grade a friend of mine made a bong out of one of these. The smoke tasted like glue. \nHe pulls out a pair of underwear. He gets dressed as he speaks. \nFERRIS His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I like him. I'm probably his only friend. I do what I can for him. I mean, if I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others, right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station. His father's dead and his sister's rumored to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit. She only puts out so people will hang out with her. It's sad but I don't hold it against her. Better to hold it against the guys who use her and don't care about her. (pause) My parents never allowed Garth over here. It was because of his family. Mainly his older brother. He's in jail. I could see them not wanting his brother here because he is a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here. I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of artificial fruit just so he could see what it was like to have his stomach pumped. But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights with the parents on that point. I always felt for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once and I was laying on the dark worrying that his brother was going to come in and hack me to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying. I asked him what was wrong and he said, \"Nothing\". ... Nothing was wrong. There was no specific thing he was crying about. In fact, he wasn't really even aware that he was crying. He just cried himself to sleep every night. It was a habit. The guy's so conditioned to grief that if he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How could you possibly dump on guy who has to deal with that kinda shit? My parents acknowledge the trudge of the situation and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel for him but still the guy's banned from our house. \nHe looks at himself in the mirror on the back of his closet door. He doesn't like what he's wearing. He continues his speech as he disrobes. \nFERRIS Unfortunately, now my parents have a legit argument. Garth doesn't need his brother to give him a rep anymore. He's getting one on his own. He's lost. It's over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from school. Gone from life. His legacy is a gas station. \n17  INT. HOUSE. STAIRCASE                                        17 \nFerris comes down the stairs. He's wearing a completely different outfit. \nFERRIS One very serious danger is playing sick is that it's possible to believe your own act. \n18  INT. KITCHEN                                                 18 \nFerris comes into the kitchen and crosses to the refrigerator. \nFERRIS That and boredom. Alot of people ditch and feel great for about an hour. Then they realize there's nothing to do. TV and food. I myself have ditched and gotten so bored I did homework. Figure that shit out. \nHe takes a sip out of a bottle of orange juice. \nFERRIS You have to plan things out before you take the day off. Otherwise you get all nervous worrying about what to do and all you get is grief and the whole point is to take it easy, cut loose and enjoy. \nHe crosses to the pantry. \nFERRIS You blow your day and at about three o'clock, when everybody's out of school, you're going to wish you'd gone to school so you could be out having fun. \nHe emerges from the pantry with a handful of Oreos. \nFERRIS Avoid the misery. Plan your day. Do it right. \nTEACHER'S VOICE Bueller? \nGIRL'S VOICE He's sick. (pause) My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who's going with a girl who saw Ferris pass-out at 31 Flavors last night. I guess it's pretty serious. \nTEACHER'S VOICE (weary) Thank you, Simone. \nGIRL'S VOICE (cheery) No problem whatsoever. \nTEACHER'S VOICE Drucker? \nBOY'S VOICE What? \nWOUND-OUT CAR ENGINES COME UP LOUD. \n28  CU. TV                                                       28 \nTHE ROAD WARRIOR is playing on video cassette. The big chase at the end. \nINT. FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS \nHe's sitting in the arm chair pretending it's Humongous' war wagon. He's wearing a hockey mash. He's steering. He reaches down and grabs an imaginary nitrous oxide valve. \nCU. TV \nHumongous reaches down and grabs a real nitrous oxide valve. He gives it a twist. \nCU. FERRIS \nHe throws himself back against the chair. \nCU. TV \nThe force of the rapid acceleration of his vehicle throws Humongous back in his seat. \nCU. FERRIS \nHe bounces himself in the chair to simulate the bumpy high speed ride. \nCU. TV \nThe was wagon hurtles down the road. \nCU. FERRIS \nHe rears back in horror. \nCU. TV \nThe war wagon is heading for a head-on collision with the tanker truck. \nCU. FERRIS \nArms outstretched, head thrown back, braced for collision. \nCU. TV \nIMPACT! \nMOZART COMES UP. \n29  CU. FLOWERING TREE BRANCH                                    29 \nOutside a bedroom window. A flowering crabtree branch. Petite pink flowers. WE PULL BACK FROM THE WINDOW INTO THE ROOM. It's Jeanie's room. A pink and powder blue pig pen. Clothes everywhere, make-up, books, records. Ferris is sitting on her bed going through a purse. \nFERRIS This is really degrading. \nHe comes up with a crumpled dollar bill. \nFERRIS Financing my activities this way. Very damaging to the self-image. But, hey, I'm broke. In times of crisis one must to what one must to. I'll pay it back. With interest. \nHe comes up with a five. \nFERRIS Regardless of how much shit sisters make you eat, how often they rat on you, how gross they act or how wicked and insensitive they can be, you should not alientate them. Because most likely they have cash and it's usually very easy to get your hands on. \nHe holds up a twenty and snaps it. PINK FLOYD'S \"MONEY\" COMES UP. \n30  INT. LIVING ROOM                                             30 \nThe song plays as Ferris digs through the sofa cushions. \nCU. SOFA \nFerris extracts a sticky quarter from a crevice. \n31  INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM                                        31 \nFerris is going through his father's pants pockets. Another crumpled bill surfaces. \n32  CU. WASHING MACHINE TOP                                      32 \nA couple of stiff, hard, bleached singles that have gone through the wash lay on top of the washer. A hand scoops them up. \n33  CU. LUCITE ENCASED PROOF SET                                 33 \nAn obvious gift from a grandparent. A U.S. Mint proof set. A ten, a five and a single enclosed in a lucite frame. A screwdriver tip wedges between the two pieces of Lucite and pops them apart. A hand peels the bills off the backing. \n34  CU. KITCHEN DRAWER                                           34 \nHands ripping through the kitchen junk drawer. Locating a dollar bill. \n35  CU. COIN COLLECTION                                          35 \nThe familiar blue collector's album. One-by-one, the quarters are being popped out of their slots. \n36  CU. VACCUUM CLEANER                                          36 \nRooney turns to the monitor. He reads off the screen. \nROONEY I have it right here in front of me. He's missed... \nHe looks closer at the screen. \n52  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            52 \nFerris is at his Macintosh computer. He has his record up on the screen. \nFERRIS I wanted a car. I got a computer. How's that for being born under a bad sign? \n53  INT. JOYCE'S OFFICE                                          53 \nShe's still on the phone with Rooney. \nJOYCE I can give you every assurance that Ferris is home and that he is, in fact, very ill. I debated whether or not I should even leave him. I can appreciate that at this time of year children are prone to taking the day off, but in Ferris' case, he's truly a very sick boy. \n54  INT. FERRIS' BEDROOM                                         54 \nMUSIC BLASTS. SOLO GUITAR. \nCU. SPEAKER \nThe grille cloth is throbbing. \nCU. LED METERS \nThe meters on the amplifier are totally in the danger zone. \nCU. TV MONITOR \nWe see Ferris in his room with a guitar around his neck. He's playing. \nCU. VIDEO CAMERA \nA home video camera is capturing Ferris on tape. \n55  INT. CAMERON'S ROOM                                          55 \nHe's sitting on the edge of the bed buttoning his shirt. He sighs deeply and fall back on the bed. \n56  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         56 \nJeanie is at her locker during a passing period. A GIRLFRIEND comes up to her. \nGIRL I'm really sorry about your brother. \nJEANIE What're you sorry for? I have to live with the trouser snake. \nGIRL No, I mean I heard he's really sick. \nJEANIE Who said he's sick. \nGIRL A whole bunch of people. They said he's like on the verge of death. \nJeanie stares incredulously at the girl. \nGIRL This guy in my biology class said that if Ferris dies he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder? He's really sweet isn't he? \nShe smiles and exits. Jeanie cocks her head in bewilderment. She kicks her locker shut. \n57  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            57 \nHe's in bed on the phone. \nFERRIS A sample of my blood was sent to Atlanta to the Center for Disease Control. I don't know, man, I'm bricking heavily. (point to the phone) Freshman. (to the phone) Did you see Alien? When the guy had the creature in his stomach? It feels like that. \n58  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         58 \nA FRESHMAN BOY is on the pay phone. A couple of his BUDDIES are standing at his side waiting anxiously for news. \nBOY Goddamn! Are you kidding? \nSECOND BOY What? \nBOY Did you see Alien? \nSECOND BOY No. \nBOY You never rented the video cassette? \nSecond boy shakes his head, no. \nBOY Oh. He's really wasted. \nTHIRD BOY (to the Second Boy) Who's he talking to? \nSECOND BOY Ferris Bueller. You know him? \nTHIRD BOY (excited) Yeah. He's getting me out of summer school. \nBOY Anyway, I appreciate you letting us know how you're doing. We gotta split. (pause) Huh?...Yeah, sure. Hold on. \nSECOND BOY (to Third Boy) Shit. I hope he doesn't die. I can't handle summer school. \nThe boy snatches a passing GIRL. \nBOY Did you see Alien? \nGIRL Yeah, why? \nHe hands her the phone. \nGIRL Hello? (pause) Who? (pause) Hi, Ferris. How's your bod? (jaw drops) Oh, my God! You're dying? Is it serious? (pause) Shiit! Are you upset? \nFerris reaches out and hits a key on his computer. The screen dumps the drawing. \nFERRIS Give yourself some credit, Dad. It was a mammoth gesture. It's like those savings bonds you used to give me every Christmas. (looks at CAMERA and smiles) It was that kind of concern. \nCU. COMPUTER SCREEN \nA message is flashing: \"TRANSMITTING DATA\". \nINT. FERRIS' ROOM \nHe turns away from the computer and puts his feet up on the desk. He lights a cigarette. \nFERRIS You had to work hard for the money to buy those things, right? \nTOM'S VOICE Not any harder than anybody else. \nFerris mouths Tom's words as he says them. \n67  EXT. CHICAGO LOOP. DIAMONDVISION SCREEN                      67 \nFerris' drawing suddenly appears on the billboard. Pedestrians stop to look. \n68  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            68 \nHe blows a smoke ring. \nFERRIS You work so hard I'll bet you don't even remember where those bonds are, right? \nFerris points a finger in the air as a cue to his father. \nTOM'S VOICE Wrong. \nHe nods. \nFERRIS Oh, yeah? You're pulling my leg. You're just trying to cheer me up. \nTOM'S VOICE Like hell I am. They're in a shoebox in my closet. \nFerris smiles. He looks at CAMERA. He's gotten exactly what he wants. \nFERRIS (to CAMERA, normal voice) Was that a class move or what? The guy gave it up faster than a drunk Catholic girl. I hope my kids don't pull this shit on me. (thinks) Of course, if they didn't, they'd be dumb and abnormal and they'd probably never move out of my house and I'd have to support them until I die. I take it back. (to the phone, sick voice) Dad? All this talking has made me kind of light-headed. I think I better lie down. \nTOM'S VOICE Okay, pal. You take care. I'll call you after lunch. \nFERRIS You don't have to, Dad. \nTOM'S VOICE I want to. Bye now. \nHe hangs up. Ferris sighs. \nFERRIS You win some, you lose some. \nHe turns his desk chair around and gets up. \nFERRIS I'm so disappointed in Cameron. Twenty bucks says he's sitting in his car debating about whether or not he should go out. \n69  INT. CAR. CAMERON                                            69 \nHe's sitting behind the wheel of his car. \nCAMERON We're gonna get caught. No doubt about it. \nHe cuts the engine. \nCAMERON I'm not doing it. \nHe sits for half a beat. \nCAMERON He'll keep calling until I come over. \nHe sighs and restarts the engine. Another beat. \nCAMERON Actually, what'll happen is I'll get caught. Ferris'll escape. \nAnother beat. He stops the engine. A CRASH OF HORROR MUSIC. \n70  CU. DRESSER DRAWER                                           70 \nHands curl around the drawer pulls. The drawer is opened slowly, ominously. The hands lift a sweater out. A HERALDIC STING as we see a men's magazine beneath the sweater. \nINT. FERRIS' ROOM \nHe takes out the magazine. He leafs through the pages for the pictorials as he speaks. \nFERRIS Cameron'll go on like that for a good thirty minutes. The guy is a shellfish when it comes to making a decision. The reason he doesn't fell good is, he worries about everything. He's the only guy I know who's deeply concerned that when he grows up there'll be a critical shortage of strategic metals. \nHe exits the room. \n71  INT. HALLWAY                                                 71 \nFerris comes out of his room and heads down the hallway. \nFERRIS Cameron's also the only guy I know who knows what strategic metals are. (waves the magazine) Pardon moi. \nHe goes into the bathroom. We HEAR THE TOILET SEAT SLAM DOWN. \nFERRIS (sings) MAYBE I'M JUST LIKE MY MOTHER, SHE'S NEVER SATISFIED... \n72  INT. CLASSROOM. LATER                                        72 \nA stunningly beautiful girl, SLOANE PETERSON, is sitting at her desk in a history class. She's staring out the window as a tweedy MALE TEACHER delivers a dry, dusty lecture. \nTEACHER Roosevelt's health had seriously deteriorated by the time he met with Churchill and Stalin at Yalta. (sneezes) Pardon me. \nThe classroom door opens and the school NURSE walks in. For a moment, the teacher thinks she's come in because she heard him sneeze. She crosses to him and whispers in his ear. \nCU. ROONEY'S FOOT \nIt freezes in mid-tap. \nCU. ROONEY'S HAND \nThe pencils falls from his fingers. \nCU. ROONEY'S FACE \nA mask of horror. He glances at the phone. \nCU. PHONE \nThe second line light is flashing. \nCU. ROONEY \nHe blinks, cocks his head, twitches. \n77  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            77 \nHe's zipping his pants, fastening his belt. The phone's cradled against his shoulder. He speaks in the same voice he used on his father. \nFERRIS Mr. Rooney? I'm sorry to disturb you at work but I was wondering if it would be possible for my sister to bring home any assignments from my classes that I may need. \n78  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. ROONEY                                   78 \nHe's staring blankly ahead. \nFERRIS' VOICE Thank you, sir. \nHe nods. \nCU. PHONE \nRooney's finger gingerly presses the button on the waiting call. \nCU. ROONEY \nHe winces as he returns to the first call. \n79  INT. FERRIS' HOUSE. KITCHEN                                  79 \nCameron's on the phone in the kitchen. He's doing a deep, phoney \"father\" voice. \nCAMERON You oughta be sorry for Christ's sake! A family member dies and you insult me. What's the matter with you, anyway? \n80  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. ROONEY                                   80 \nHe apologies profusely to Cameron. He's perspiring, trembling. \nROONEY I don't know. I thought you were someone else. You have to know, sir, that I would never deliberately insult you. I can't begin to tell you how embarrassed I am. \nCAMERON'S VOICE Pardon my French but you're an asshole! \nRooney nods enthusiastically. \nROONEY Absolutely! I most certainly am. \n81  INT. KITCHEN                                                 81 \nCameron lays into Rooney. \nCAMERON This isn't over yet, buster. You just make sure my daughter's out in front of the school in ten minutes. Do you read me? \nROONEY'S VOICE Load and clear, Mr. Peterson. \nCAMERON Call me sir, goddamn it! \nROONEY'S VOICE Sir. \nCAMERON That's better. \nFerris strolls into the kitchen to catch the last of the conversation. Cameron covers the phone. \nCAMERON (to Ferris) I'm scared shitless, Ferris! What is Rooney guesses my voice! \nFERRIS Impossible. You're doing great. \nCameron sighs and goes back to the phone. \nCAMERON (clears his throat) I don't have all day to bark at you so I'll make this short and sweet. \nFerris gives Cameron an enthusiastic thumbs up. \nFERRIS (mouths) Great! \nCameron smiles proudly. \nCAMERON I want my daughter out in front of the school in ten minutes. By herself. I don's want anyone around... \nFerris smacks Cameron. He's said the wrong thing. He covers the phone. \nCAMERON What'd I do? \nFERRIS Out in front my herself? It's too suspicious! He'll think something's up, moron. Cover it. \nCameron panics. He holds the phone out to Ferris. \nCAMERON You do it! \nFerris waves his arms angrily. \nFERRIS Talk! \nFERRIS No, ma'am, I'm giving it to the government. They need it. Do you know what an aircraft carrier's going for these days? \nINT. BANK. JOYCE \nShe concludes her meeting. She shakes hands with the loan officer and stands. The Vermont Couple stands.

BANK. DOOR \nJoyce and the Vermont Couple approach the doors. Boyd lays a luggie in the drinking fountain. Mrs. Froeling passes with the savings bonds. She stops when she sees Joyce. \nJOYCE Mrs. Froeling, how are you? \nMRS. FROELING I passed a kidney stone Tuesday. (shifts gears, to Joyce) Say, you must be very proud. \nJoyce doesn't know what she's talking about. \nMRS. FROELING (whispers) I met Madonna. \nShe pats Joyce on the arm. \nMRS. FROELING She told me everything. Keep me posted, I'll want to send a gift. \nShe toodles on her way. Joyce and the Vermont Couple are completely baffled. \n95  EXT.

He picks up a stone and hurls it into the parking lot. \nJOYCE My son's home sick today. If you wouldn't mind, on our way back to the office, I'd like to just run in and check up on him. \nWe HEAR A METALLIC PING! as Boyd's missle hits a car. \nMOTHER Of course. \nThey pass a show window. As they pass, we hold on the window. It's promoting saving for college educations. A mannequin father is congratulating his mannequin son in a mortar and gown as a stiff Sloane, Ferris and Cameron look on proudly. \n96  INT.

See? \nThe secretary nods. \nSECRETARY And her grandmother, too. \n97  CU. PHONE ANSWER MACHINE                                     97 \nIt clicks on. We hear a grieved woman's voice.

She's stopped by a KID with a Coke can. \nKID Yo. We're collecting money to buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney. \nJeanie stares at him. She's flabbergasted at the proportions her brother's scan has reached. \nSLOANE What? \nFERRIS Let's go feed Cameron. \nThey stand up and head out. Ferris hangs back a moment. He cups his hands to his mouth. He yells at the top of his voice. \nFERRIS BUY! \nAnd he exits. Cool and casual. \n118  INT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE.

I'm very busy right now. If you have trouble finding the door... \nSloane tugs Ferris' sleeve. He ignores her. \nFERRIS Are you suggesting that I'm not who I say I am? \nMAITRE'D Shall I call the police? \nCAMERON Let's go...Abe. \nFERRIS I'm not going anywhere. (to the Maitre'd) Call the police. Go ahead. Better yet... (grabs the phone) ...I'll call myself. \nCameron chokes. Sloane grits her teeth. The maitre'd smiles smuggly. \nCU. PHONE \nFerris punches out a number. A beat and the restaurant's second line lights up and the phone rings. \nINT. RESTAURANT \nThe maitre'd motions for the phone so that he can answer the call. Ferris waves him off angrily. \nFERRIS You touch me and I yell \"rat!\" There's another phone around here. Find it. \nThe maitre'd backs off. \nCAMERON Ferris, let's split, please? \nSLOANE Cameron's right. We're gonna get busted. \nFERRIS Not a chance in the world. \nHe hands the phone to Sloane. \nFERRIS Ask for Abe Frohman. \nINT. RESTAURANT. LATER \nFerris, Sloane and Cameron are seated in the restaurant. The maitre'd is hovering over Ferris. \nMAITRE'D I appreciate your understanding. \nFERRIS Don't grovel, Charles. Just leave us to our repast and all will be forgotten. \nMAITRE'D Enjoy your luncheon. \nFERRIS Thank you. \nThe maitre'd backs away. Ferris smiles. Sloane is impressed. Cameron is flushed with nerves. \nFERRIS Darling, you were wonderful. \nSLOANE Oh, but I had a wonderful teacher. \nFERRIS Cameron, dear friend? \nCameron looks to Ferris. \nFERRIS And you thought we wouldn't have any fun. Shame on you. \nFerris disappears behind his menu. \n124  INT. RESTAURANT                                             124 \nCameron and Sloane have been served their lunches. They're staring at the plates. \nCAMERON What is it? \nSLOANE I don't know. But it looks like it's already been eaten and digested. \nCAMERON I knew it was a mistake letting Ferris order for us. \nFerris slides over to the table and drops into his seat. \nFERRIS What are you doing? \nCameron looks at Ferris. \nCAMERON What is this shit? \nFERRIS You got me. I don't speak French. \nHe puts his napkin in his lap and smells his plate. \nFERRIS I think it's a land-based beefoid creature. \nHe takes a bite. He savors the taste. \nFERRIS Splendid. \nCAMERON Really? \nFERRIS Superb. \nCameron and Sloane try theirs. They chew tentatively. \nFERRIS Good? \nSloane and Cameron shrug. It's not bad. A WAITER passes. Ferris stops him. \nFERRIS Yo, Clouseau! \nThe waiter stops and looks at Ferris indignantly. \nFERRIS I have a growth on my brain that causes memory lapses. Could you tell me what we ordered here? \nThe waiter glances at the plates. \nWAITER Sweetbreads. \nFERRIS Uh, huh. And what might that be? \nWAITER Pancreas. \nFERRIS As in the gland that has important functions in digestion and metabolism? \nCU. SLOANE AND CAMERON \nThey stop chewing. They're holding their sweetbreads in their mouths. \nCU. FERRIS \nHe continues his questioning. \nFERRIS ...That secretes a thick, colorless fluid containing digestive enzymes? The home of the world famous isles of Langerhans? \nCU. WAITER \nHe nods broadly, knowing that he's spoiling the kids' meal. \nCU. SLOANE AND CAMERON \nThey look at each other. \nCU. FERRIS \nHe pats his mouth with his napkin. He looks to Cameron and Sloane. He raises a finger, holds it a beat and gives a cue. \nCU. WAITER \nHe turns away as Sloane and Cameron spit out their food. \nCU. FERRIS \nHe watches Sloane and Cameron then glances at the waiter. \nFERRIS Check, please! \n125  EXT.

Ferris, Sloane and Cameron come out of the restaurant. They approach the cab. Tom's back it to Ferris. Ferris stops cold. \nFERRIS, SLOANE, CAMERON \nThey turns on cue at Tom, now in the B.G., turns toward the restaurant. \nFERRIS 40,000 restaurants in the downtown area and I pick the one my father goes to. \nCAMERON We're gonna get nabbed, for sure. \nFERRIS No way, Cameron. Only the meek get nabbed. The bold survive. Let's go. \nHe turns to the cab. Sloane and Cameron turn slowly. \nEXT. STREET. CAB \nTom and his party are still jawing at curbside. Ferris, Sloane and Cameron slowly approach the cab. Behind the backs of the men, Ferris scoots Sloane into the cab. Cameron dashes in. The Ferris hops the cab. \nSLOANE I'm not sure but I think I know who Ferris was. \nCAMERON Hannibal. \nSLOANE From the A-Team? \nCAMERON No. The guy who rode the elephants into Switzerland. \nSloane laughs at herself. They step out of the crowd and head down the street in the direction the parade's heading. \nSLOANE I think if he was anybody, he was Magellan. You know, the guy who went around the world. \nCameron nods. \nSLOANE I could see him ignoring popular belief and taking off on some impossible mission. \nCAMERON Yeah. As long as I've known him, everything works for him. There's nothing he can't handle. I can't handle anything. School, parents, the future. Ferris can do anything. \nEXT. STATE STREET. FLOAT \nFerris is playing \"TWIST AND SHOUT\" on the accordian.

SLOANE AND CAMERON \nThey continue their conversation. \nSLOANE The future's worse for a boy, isn't it? \nCameron doesn't understand what she means. \nSLOANE A girl can always bail out and have a baby and get some guy to support her. \nCAMERON That's a pretty grim thought. \nSLOANE True, but it's an option. No options is worse. \nCAMERON I don't know what I'm gonna do. \nSLOANE College. \nCAMERON Yeah, but to do what? \nSLOANE What are you interested in? \nCAMERON Nothing. \nSLOANE Me either. \nThey walk on for a few beats.

They're singing in their angleic voices. \nCHOIR AND LET ME KNOW THAT YOU'RE MINE! \nROONEY I'm not leaving, Ferris. \nThere's no response. Rooney rings the doorbell again. The pre-recorded litany starts over. \nFERRIS' VOICE Who is it? \nRooney doesn't realize that he's listening to a recording. \nROONEY Don't get smart with me Ferris! \nFERRIS' VOICE I'm sorry I can't come to the door right now. I'm very ill and I'm afraid that in my weakened condition... \nRooney leans back from the door. He can't quite figure out what's going on. But's it's highly suspicious. \n143  INT. HOUSE. LIVING ROOM                                     143 \nRooney steps through the hedges and peeks in the windows.

KITCHEN                                         144 \nRooney tries to peak in the kitchen window. \nFERRIS' VOICE I appreciate your conern for my well-being. It will be remembered long after... \n145  EXT. HOUSE. BACKDOOR                                        145 \nA black rubber doggie door. The type that allows a dog to come and go as it pleases. Rooney is crouched down. He lifts the doggie door and peeks in the house. \nHIS POV \nAlong the kitchen floor. Through the kitchen, into the dining room. We hear a LARGE DOG GROWL. \nCU. ROONEY \nHe's peaking through the door. He hears the dog. His face freezes. \nFERRIS Have a nice day. \nEXT. HOUSE. DOGGIE DOOR \nA Rottweiler bursts through the doggie door in a fury of gnashing teeth and foam. \n146  CU. LARGE BREASTS                                           146 \nTassled pasties twirl like airplane propellers. \nCU. CAMERON, FERRIS AND SLOANE \nThey're sitting in a booth in the garish, nearly deserted strip joint. Cameron's mouth is open in amazement. Sloane is embarrassed and revolted. \nCAMERON How does she do that? One goes one way, one goes the other. \nFERRIS She's probably schizophrenic. \nSLOANE Ferris, this is nauseating me. Really. I'm losing respect for you by the bucket. \nFERRIS You don't think it's amazing that we got in? \nSLOANE Who wants to get in? \nFERRIS Cameron looks like a toddler, for Christ's sake. I'm talking about a major achievement in false identification. \nSLOANE I'm not interested in watching someone jiggle their mammary glands. \nFERRIS Point well taken. But consider why she does it. Why she does it and you don't. \nSLOANE I'm not a tramp. \nFERRIS Maybe her life fell apart. Maybe she lost somebody. A lover. A boyfriend. A parent. A child... (to CAMERA) This kind of thing makes me a little depressed. You may think because I'm the age I am that I'm a sex maniac. That sex is all I think about. But that's not true. I'm a romantic. I think alot of people my age are. We think about love and matters of the heart. And SAT scores and acne aside, we worry about lonliness. It's a terrible thing. And we feel it. I feel it. \nHe flips his collar up, curls his lip and affects an Elvis impression. A sappy, do-wop track FADES UP. The club lights go down. Cameron and Sloane disappear into darkness. Ferris stands up from the booth. He strolls slowly through the empty club as the stripper bumps and grinds in a pool of blue light. \nFERRIS You know, someone said the world's a stage and each must play a part. Fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart. Act one was when we met. I loved you at first glance. You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue. Then came act two. You seemed to change. You acted strange. And why, I've never known. \nHe climbs up on the little runway. The stripper disappears in darkness as Ferris takes over the spotlight. \nFERRIS Honey, you lies when you said you loved me and I had no cause to doubt you. But I'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you. Now, the stage is bare and I'm standing there with emptiness all around and if you won't come back to me, then they can bring the curtain down... \nElvis fades up. The orignal recording. Ferris lip synchs with the big, dramatic florish that was the King's trademark ballad sign-off. \nELVIS IS YOUR HEART FILLED WITH PAIN? SHALL I COME BACK AGAIN? TELL ME DEAR, ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT? \nFerris drops his head. Like the King would. \n147  EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET. CAMERON'S CAR                         147 \nCameron's father is looking at the car. He's studying it. It looks terribly familiar. He leans into the open car and reaches for the glovebox to see if the contents will confirm if it's his. He freezes. He looks up slowly. \nHIS POV \nThe Attendant and the Rastaman are glowering at him. They're holding bags of fried chicken. \nATTENDANT You looking for something in my car? \nCU. CAMERON'S FATHER \nHe shakes his head, no. \nCAMERON'S FATHER No. \n148  EXT. FERRIS' TOWN. JEANIE                                   148 \nJeanie's standing at her car. She's staring incredulously into the distance. Her mouth's open. She's shaking her head slowly. \nEXT. BACKYARD. ROONEY \nHe's standing outside the fence. He's missing a shoe. His suit pants are torn from the crotch to the knee. His suit coat pocket is torn off. His hair's messed and there're grass-stains on his knees and elbows. He's looking in at the dog. \nROONEY That's a $28.00 dress shoe, you worthless mutt! \nHIS POV \nThe Rottweiler leaps at CAMERA. \n152  EXT. CITY STREET                                            152 \nFerris is leading the way down Michigan Avenue. He's hustling through the crowd. He has Sloane by the hand. She's jogging to keep up. Cameron's a few steps behind. He keeps bumping into people. Ferris and Sloane make the turn at Wacker Driver and disappear into the Stone Container Building. Cameron follows, mumbling again. \nCAMERON Money...tits...please... \n153  EXT. HOUSE. FRONT                                           153 \nA florist truck pulls up in front of the house.

He greets Rooney cheerily. \nDELIVERY MAN Howdy! \nHe presses the doorbell. A beat and we hear Ferris' recording. \nFERRIS' VOICE Who is it? \nThe Deliver Man presses the intercom. \nDELIVERY MAN Focus on Flowers. I have a delivery. \nFERRIS' VOICE I'm sorry but I can't come to the door right now. I'm very ill and I'm afraid... \nROONEY                              FERRIS' VOICE It's a recording, asshole.        ...that in my weakened condition, I could take a DELIVERY MAN            nasty spill and subject What's your problem?              myself to further school absenses... ROONEY                        (pause) He's one of my students.          You can reach my parents at their places of DELIVERY MAN            business. Thank you for Little bugger's dying.            stopping by. I appreciate your concern for my well- ROONEY                  being. It will be What?                             remembered long after this illness has passed. \nDELIVERY MAN As I heard it from our mailman he was supposedly born with only half a kidney. \nFERRIS' VOICE Have a nice day. \nDELIVERY MAN (to the intercom) Thank you. (continues) I don't know the details. But my boss had to send to Milwaukee to get more orchids. He's very popular. \nRooney is flabbergasted. \nDELIVERY MAN Nobody's home here? \nROONEY No. \nDELIVERY MAN You gonna be around for awhile? \nROONEY I imagine so. \nDELIVERY MAN You wanna keep an eye on these? \nRooney looks at the flowers. Then he looks at the Delivery Man. \nDELIVERY MAN (happy sigh) It really touches me that so many people are rallying behind this guy. I guess there's hope for the human race afterall. \nHe hands the arrangement to Rooney. \nDELIVERY MAN Gotta run. \nHe bounds off the porch and trots to the truck. Rooney looks incredulously at the arrangement. He opens the attached card. \nROONEY (defeated) Oh, Christ... \nCU. CARD \nIt's signed: \nALL OUR BEST FOR A SPEEDY RECOVERY THE ENGLISH DEPT.

Sorry about that. \nFERRIS It's cool. \nJeanie draws back and punches out her radio. \nCU. CAR ANTENNA \nThe impact of her blow to the radio shoots the antenna in the air. \nFERRIS' VOICE My input on the Star Wars defense plan was pretty substantial so I guess this is their way of rewarding me. I'm pretty flattered. \nEXT. CAR \nJoyce and her clients leave a show house and head toward the car. \nINT. CAR \nBoyd looks out the window as his parents and Joyce appear. \nD.J.

There's an intruder, male caucasian, possibly armed, certainly weird, in our kitchen. (pause) My name is Bueller. \nThere's another pause. Jeanie's face drops. \nJEANIE It's real nice that you hope my brother's feeling better but I'm in danger, okay? I'm very cute, I'm very alone and I'm very protective of my body. I'd rather not have it violated or killed. I need help! \n175  INT. KITCHEN                                                175 \nRooney's plugging his bloody nose with paper towel. The intercom goes on. \nJEANIE'S VOICE Excuse me. If whoever's in the house is still in the house, I'd like you to know that I have just called the police. If you have any brains whatsoever, you'll get your ass out of my house real quick. \nRooney stiffens with fear. \nJEANIE'S VOICE I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun. And a scorching case of herpes. \n176  EXT. STREET                                                 176 \nRooney's car is hooked to a tow truck. It's parked in front of a fire hydrant and the windshield is decorated with parking citations. In the distance SIRENS WAIL. \n177  EXT. PARKING LOT                                            177 \nThe three are waiting for the Ferrari. We HEAR TIRES SQUEALING, AN ENGINE REVING-OUT. Then the Ferrari pulls down the ramp and jams to a frightening stop. A BLACK GUY jumps out. Ferris hands him the parking stub. \nFERRIS Just out of curiosity, what was your top speed coming down the ramp? \nBLACK GUY (matter-of-fact) About 60. \nFERRIS Stunning! \nHe hands him a buck and opens the door and pulls the passenger seat forward for Cameron. \nFERRIS This is probably the last time you'll have to ride back here. Keep that in mind. \nCameron gives him a look and squeezes in. \nJEANIE Thank...you... \nHer jaw goes slack. She blinks her eyes. \nHER POV \nThe Delivery Man and a young ASSISTANT are standing at the door with floral arrangements. Spread all around them are more flowers. A sexy singing NURSE and a BALLOON MAN steps up on the porch. \nNURSE (sings) WE HOPE YOU'RE FEELING BETTER WE HOPE YOU'RE FELLING FIT WE... \nThe door slams shut. \n181  EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET                                    181 \nRooney's walking down the street. A school bus is crawling alongside him as kids hang out the windows. From inside we hear SHOUTING and seventeen different SONGS PLAYING ON BLASTERS. A top forty montage. \nKID Hey, Mr. Rooney! What're you doing? \nRooney doesn't respond. \nANOTHER KID Did you get in a fight? \nRooney keep walking. The bus doors open. The DRIVER calls out to him. \nDRIVER You want a lift? \nRooney takes a few more steps. He stops. The bus stops. Rooney takes a deep breath. He climbs aboard the bus. \n182  INT. BUS                                                    182 \nThe bus is jammed with WONKS and WEINERETTES. The passengers are silent as they watch Rooney shuffle down the aisle and take an empty seat next to a skinny, myopic GIRL. \nCU. GIRL \nShe looks at Rooney and smiles. She pushes her Coke bottle glasses up on her nose. \nCU. ROONEY \nHe looks vacantly at her. \nCU. GIRL \nShe holds her smile. \nGIRL I'll bet you never smelled a real school bus before. \nCU. ROONEY \nHe stares at her. \nCU. GIRL \nShe holds up a candy package. \nGIRL Gummi Bear? \nCU. ROONEY \nHe stares at her. \nCU. GIRL \nShe puts one in her mouth. \nGIRL They've been in pocket. They're real soft and warm. \nCU. BOY \nA rotund FRESHMAN BOY sitting across from Rooney is staring at him. \nCU. ROONEY \nHe looks across to the kid. \nCU. BOY \nHe leans forward. \nFRESHMAN BOY It's kind of like being in the belly of the beast isn't it? \nCU. ROONEY \nHe turns him eyes to the front. The bus jerks forward and pulls away. \n183  EXT.

He addresses CAMERA. \nFERRIS This may very well be for real. I think Cameron might have blown a micro-chip or two. He's always been a little keyed-up. All I wanted to do was give him a good day. We're gonna graduate in a couple of months. Then we have the summer. He'll work and I'll work. And we'll see each other at night and on the weekends but then he'll go to one school and I'll go to another. And basically that'll be it. As much as we like each other, the process of growing up will separate us. \nHe begins to walk. We follow him. \nFERRIS Sloane's a bigger problem. She still has another year of high school. How do I deal with that? I was serious when I said I'd marry her. I would. This isn't just teenage infatuation. That's what my parents call it. What do they call what they have? If that's love, I'll take infatuation. \nCU. CAMERON \nHis eyes are closed. Sloane's stroking his hair. \nFERRIS (VO) Cameron's never been in love. At least no one's ever been in love with him. He's gonna marry the first girl he lays. And she's gonna treat him like shit because he's gonna kiss her ass for giving him what he's built-up in his mind as the end-all, be-all of human existance. She won't respect him because you can't respect someone who kisses your ass. It just doesn't work. \nCU. SLOANE \nEXT. BACKYARD \nFerris sits Cameron on the edge of the Jacuzzi. \nFERRIS CAMERON! \nCU. CAMERON \nHis eyes are closed. He's lifeless. \nCU. FERRIS \nHis face is a mask of terror. He shakes Cameron. \nCU. SLOANE \nShe's screaming. \nCU. CAMERON \nA smile spreads across his face. \nCU. FERRIS \nHe sees the smile. He stops shaking Cameron. \nEXT. JACUZZI \nFerris and Cameron are looking at each other. Sloane's still screaming. She realizes that Cameron's okay. She stops screaming. \nSLOANE What? \nFERRIS (Cameron) You asshole! \nCameron's smiling. \nSLOANE What? \nFerris starts to laugh. Cameron explodes with laughter. Sloane's bewildered. \nSLOANE What's so funny? \n186  INT. POLICE STATION. WAITING ROOM                           186 \nJeanie's sitting on a wooden bench with a WASTED TEENAGE BOY in a Triumph t-shirt, long hair, torn jeans, creepers, studs and chains. He's studying her. \nBOY Drugs? \nJEANIE No, thank you. I'm straight. \nBOY I meant, are you here for drugs? \nJeanie stares at him. \nJEANIE Why are you here? \nBOY Drugs. \nJEANIE I don't know why I'm here. \nBOY Then why don't you go home? \nJEANIE Why don't you put your thumb up your butt? \nThe boy stares at her. \nBOY You want to talk about your problem? \nJEANIE With you? Are you serious? \nBOY Yeah, I'm serious. \nJEANIE Blow yourself. \nJeanie turns away. The boy crosses his legs. Jeanie looks back at him. \nJEANIE You really want to know what's wrong? \nThe boy shrugs. \nJEANIE Alright. If you've got the time, I've got the troubles. In a nutshell, I hate my brother. How's that? \nBOY That's cool. Did you shoot him or something? \nJEANIE No, not yet. \nThe boy nods. He understands the emotion. \nJEANIE I went home to confirm that the shithead was ditching school and a guy broke into the house and I called the cops and they picked me up for making a phoney phone call. \nBOY What do you care if your brother ditches school? \nJeanie stares at the boy. \nJEANIE Why should he get to ditch school when everybody else has to go? \nBOY You could ditch. \nJEANIE I'd get caught. \nBOY So, you're pissed at him because he ditches and doesn't get caught? \nJEANIE Basically. \nThe boy nods knowingly. \nHe turns to CAMERA. \nFERRIS This is a big U-2 fan. \nCU. SLOANE \nShe smiles proudly at Cameron. She applauds him. \nCU. CAMERON \nHe's serious and determined. He has made up his mind and it appears that it won't be changed by anyone but himself. \nCU. TIRES \nIt's spinning wildly. \nCU. MERCEDES BUMPER \nCameron's foot rests on the bumper. A beat and it gives a mighty shove. \nCU. TIRE \nThe spinning tires slam down on the cement. \nINT. GARAGE \nCameron has kicked the Ferrari off the jack. It squeals out of the garage in a cloud of blue tire smoke. A $50,000 unmanned investment heading backwards down a driveway. \nCU. SLOANE AND FERRIS \nThey're in shock. \nEXT. HOUSE \nThe Ferrari shoots down the driveway. \nINT. GARAGE \nCameron watches the car go. He's strangely placcid about the impending disaster. Ferris and Sloane are bewildered. \nTHEIR POV \nThe Ferrari travels down the driveway, across the street, over the curb into the wooded property opposite the house. \nCU. TREE \nThe Ferrari's brief journey ends as it smacks a tree trunk. \nINT. GARAGE \nFerris and Sloane exchange baffled looks. They look at Cameron. He's proud and bold. \nFERRIS What was that about? \nSLOANE This has to be a dream. \nFERRIS Cameron? One quick question. Why'd you do that? \nCameron holds his proud posture for a beat. Then a look of bewilderment comes over his face. He shoots a look to Ferris. A puzzled look. \nFERRIS You trashed the car. \nCameron looks across the street. \nSLOANE Why? \nCAMERON I took a stand. \nFERRIS No, Cameron. You wrecked a car. \nCameron thinks for a moment. Then he regains his confidence. \nCAMERON It's okay. \nFerris looks across the street at the car. \nFERRIS I have an idea. If you're interested. \nCameron looks at him. He shakes his head. \nCAMERON I'm gonna handle it. \nFERRIS I think this could work. \nCAMERON No, thanks. I want to deal with it by myself. \nSLOANE What about your one word? \nCAMERON You already did it. If I need it again, I'll use it. \nHe smiles. He raises am impish eyebrow. \nCAMERON It's cool. I'm loose. \n188  INT. POLICE STATION. OFFICE                                 188 \nJoyce is talking with the juvenile officer. Outside the office, on the bench, we see Jeanie and the boy making out. \nJOYCE She's never been in trouble before. This is a shock to me. First, I don't know why she wasn't at school. Second, I don't know why she'd call you with this story about a rapist. \nOFFICER For whatever reasons she did it, I think she'd had a good scare. \nJOYCE I hope so. I appreciate your calling me. I can assure you that her father and I will have a long talk with her. \nThe gathers her purse and jacket and stands. \n195  INT.

FERRIS' HOUSE                                          196 \nTom pulls in the driveway. He parks and gets out. Joyce pulls in from the other direction. \n197  EXT. HOUSE. BACK PORCH                                      197 \nFerris tries the door. It's locked. He reaches down and lifts the doormat. \nCU. PORCH \nThe outline of a key in the dirt under the mat. The key's gone. The toe of a chewed-up dress shoe steps INTO FRAME. An OMNIOUS CHORD IS STRUCK. \nCU. FERRIS \nHe stares up in horror. \nHIS POV \nRooney's looking down at him. He's holding the house key. \nEXT. PORCH \nFerris stands up. He smiles. \nROONEY Looking for this? \nFERRIS Yes. \nROONEY I got you, Ferris. This time I finally got you. \nFerris is caught. There's no way out. Rooney gloats severely. \nROONEY How does another year of high school sit with you? \nSuddenly, the backdoor opens. Jeanie looks out. She feigns joy and relief. She rushes Ferris and hugs him. \nJEANIE Thank God, you're alright! We've been worried sick! \nCU. FERRIS \nA moment of curiosity. Then it dawns on him what's happening. He smiles. \nCU. ROONEY \nHis eyes dart from Ferris to Jeanie to Ferris. His victory is evaporating. \nEXT. PORCH \nJeanie breaks the embrace. \nJEANIE (to Rooney) Thank you for bringing him home, Mr. Rooney.

ROONEY \nHe's dumbfounded. \nCU. JEANIE \nShe raises her hands and strikes a karate pose. A huge smile passes over her face. \nCU.

They look up at Ferris as he comes in from outside. \nTODD Ferris?  Does my head look like it's getting bigger? \nFerris leans against the counter as he tries to catch his breath. He looks at his little brother. \nFERRIS No, but Kimberly's is. \nHe crosses to the refrigerator and opens it. Kimberly feels her head. \nKIMBERLY (to Todd) Is he serious? \nTODD I think so. \nKIMBERLY Oh, shit! \n", "test1_input": "CAMERON He knows the mileage, Ferris. He has it tatooed on his wrist. \nFERRIS He doesn't trust you? \nCAMERON No. \nFERRIS Alright, look, this is real simple.

Cameron blanches. \nFERRIS Hello, Mrs. Froeling. How are you? \nTELLER \nShe pats the rock-solid mass of blue hair. In doing so she locates a missing ball point pen. She withdraws it from the hair and smiles at it's reappearance. \nTELLER I passed a kidney stone Tuesday, so I'm a little pooped but other than that, I'm as chipper as can be.

Is he serious. \nFERRIS I'm game. \nSLOANE No way! \nFERRIS I'll do it, if you will. \nCameron suddenly adds his two cents. \nCAMERON You need a blood test. \nFerris looks around at him. \nFERRIS Huh? \nCAMERON If your blood's not compatible, you could produce a pinhead. The state requires a blood test. \nFERRIS So? \nCAMERON So, you can't get married today. \nFERRIS Tomorrow? \nCAMERON If you get a blood test today. \nSLOANE I'm not getting married. \nCAMERON I'm with you, babe. \nFERRIS Why not? \nSLOANE What do you mean, why not? Think about it. \nFERRIS Besides being too young and your father hating my guts and not having any place to live and feeling awkward about being the only cheer- leader with a husband, give me a good reason why not. \nCAMERON I'll give you two. My mother and father. \nFerris and Sloane look at him curiously. \nCAMERON They're married and they hate each other. (to Ferris) You've seen them. Am I right? \nFERRIS You're father's a toad and your Mom's always wired out, but so what? They're old. That's natural. \nCAMERON It makes me puke. Seeing people treat each other like that. It's like the car. He loves the car. He hates his wife. \nSLOANE My parents are divorced. So what? It's not like it doesn't happen ten thousand times a day. \nCAMERON Just because it happens doesn't make it right. Are you comfortable with it? \nSLOANE No. It's not something I can get comfortable with. I've tried. Are yours divorced? \nCAMERON They may as well be. \nSLOANE Do you think they're staying together because of you? \nCameron hasn't seen it that way. He shrugs. \nSLOANE Do they like you? \nIt hasn't occured to Cameron that his parents might not like him. That parental love might not be a given. \nCAMERON Yeah. Sure. \nSLOANE Consider this...my father canned me and my brother and my Mom for a twenty five year old dipso with fake tits. He dropped us like a rock. Everything was cool at our house. I thought so. We all thought so. Then BLAM! It's over. \nFERRIS (to CAMERA) This is all news to me. She keeps a pretty good secret. \nSLOANE (to Cameron) It was pure selfishness. When I have a kid, I don't care how much I want something, if it's gonna screw-up the kid, forget it. \nFERRIS (to CAMERA) She's not lying. \nCAMERON You could change. \nSLOANE Yeah. But I'm gonna try not to. I'm gonna think about it. I'm gonna try to prevent it. \nFERRIS This is optomism. It's a common trait with my age group. Adults think it's cute, it's like a charming quick that infests youth. But it's a cool thing and I think, deep down, crusty old shits wish they had some. They wish they had her, too. (points to Sloane) Sorry. She's taken. \nCAMERON I'd rather not have my family break apart, thank you. \nSLOANE Well, you know what? It ain't up to you. It's out of your hands. \nCAMERON So, I in other words, I should just sit back and watch it crumble? \nSLOANE You're merely an inhabitant in their universe. \nFERRIS Frightening choice of words. \nSLOANE They call the shots. When you split from them, you call the shots. \nCAMERON So, you're saying I should run away? \nFERRIS No. She's saying it's time for lunch. \n", "test2_id": 1888, "test3_input": "FERRIS One of the most frightening experiences of my young life has been observing my parents and our neighbors playing the Baby Boom Edition of Trivial Pursuits. It's chilling to see people crazed with the minutia of their past. \nCAMERON It's human nature to like what you had better than what you have. \nSLOANE Agreed. \nA loud speaker on the boat identifies a point of interest. \nLOUDSPEAKER TO YOUR LEFT IT THE WORLD'S TALLEST BUILDING... \nThe three look to the left. \nLOUDSPEAKER, FERRIS, SLOANE, CAMERON The Sears Tower. \nCAMERON You know, this is all very interesting but I'm starving. \nFERRIS An hour ago you wanted to yack. \nCAMERON I feel better now. \nFERRIS Lean over and grab a fish. \nCameron looks over the side of the boat.

The secretary looks up and greets her with a weary smile. \nSECRETARY Hello, Jeanie. Who's bothering you now? \nJeanie scowls at her. \nJEANIE Is Dean Rooney in? \nSECRETARY I'm sorry, he's out. Can I help you? \nJEANIE (condescending) I seriously doubt it. When's he back? \nSECRETARY I don't know. He left the grounds on personal business. \n132  EXT. STREET. CU.

NAPKIN HOLDER \nA hand yanks a napkin hold. \nINT. HOT DOG STAND. SERVICE COUNTER \nRooney wipes his face. Behind him is the kitchen and a grease-covered TV set broadcasting a Cubs baseball game. There's a long foul ball. The TV camera follows the ball into the stands. A kid makes a stab at the ball. Rooney wipes his suit off. The TV camera zooms in on the boy triumphantly holding the foul ball aloft. It's Ferris. He does a little celebration dance. Rooney wads up the napkin and tosses it in a trashbin. The TV camera returns to the game. Rooney glances at the screen. \nROONEY What's the score? \nHOT DOG MAN Zero to zero. \nROONEY Who's winning? \nHOT DOG MAN Cubs. \nRooney nods and exits. \n134  EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD.

We just got here. \nSLOANE You got a call, you broke your thumb, what's left to do? \nCameron offers his nachos to Sloane. She looks at them with disgust. \nSLOANE No wonder you're always sick. \nFerris leans back, puts his hands behind his head and turns his face to the bright sun. \nFERRIS Do you realize that if I played by the rules, right now I'd be in gym? \n135  EXT. HIGH SCHOOL. PLAYING FIELD                             135 \nA boy's gym class is doing laps. A blue Fiat pulls into the shot. \n136  INT.

She sneaks a glance at the school. \nJEANIE I can't believe my brother's making me put myself in a position where I could get expelled. Selfish little moron. (pause) Ferris? You're overshadowed me long enough. I'm gonna get you, buddy. \nShe puts the car in gear and drives out of the shot. \n137  EXT.

SLOANE AND CAMERON \nThey're watching Ferris go by. They wave to him. \nSLOANE I love him. \nCAMERON It's hard not to. \nCameron breaks a smile. As worried as he is about the day and getting caught, he has to admire Ferris for his lack of inhabitions. Cameron mumbles a few words. \nCAMERON Stop...water...want... \nSLOANE Do you believe in reincarnation? \nCAMERON Huh? \nSLOANE Do you believe that you lived before? \nCAMERON Yeah. Sort of. \nSLOANE DO you ever wonder what you were? \nCAMERON I don't have to wonder. I know. \nSloane looks at him with amazement. \nCAMERON I was a tractor tire. \nEXT. STATE STREET.

SHANE I don't give a shit! 
Shane gets to his feet. 
SHANE Huddle up! 
Everybody leans in. 
SHANE If you've got something to say, raise your hand! Is that understood?! 
Lee raises his hand.   Shane grits his teeth and nods. 
LEE Suppose like, you don't feel good. Or you're hurt or something like that. Then what? 
SHANE Then you tell me before the huddle starts! Okay, listen up: 68 blue east storm toss. On two. 
Jamal raises his hand. 
SHANE What?! 
JAMAL That's to the right... right? 
ANDRE No, it's to the left. 
SHANE It's to the right! 
JAMAL You better be quiet, Shane, they'll hear you. 
We do hear a WHISTLE.        A penalty flag flies by. 
REF Delay of game!     Five yards! 
Shane throws ups his hands. 
ON McGINTY 
He's talking into his mike. 
McGINTY What the hell is going on? 
ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL 
MADDEN Well, Pat, so far the Redskins have minus ten yards offensively. 
ON O'NEIL 
He's in bed sucking oxygen watching the game. Augustine sits with him. 
O'NEIL 
Turn it off. This is going to kill me. 
ON REDSKIN HUDDLE 
It breaks this time and everyone runs to the line of scrimmage. 
SHANE Blue 68. Blue 68! Hut! Hut! 
On the snap, Shane turns to head off to Lamont but instead runs right into Jamal who knocks him down. 
Shane looks up at Jamal. 
SHANE Have you suddenly decided you don't like me, Jamal? 
JAMAL Oh. You said it was to the right, didn't you? 
IN HUDDLE 
Shane leans in. 
SHANE Okay. Let's try something simple. 18 red left slot open. (to Jamal) That's to the left! 
They break and Shane lines up over his center. 
SHANE Eighteen red! Eighteen red! Hut! Hut! 
On the snap, Shane hands to Lamont who sweeps left, cuts inside and picks up eight yards. 
Shane is ecstatic. 
SHANE Yeah! 
And then a penalty flag flies by. 
REF Holding! Number 78. 
Shane looks at Jamal who is trying desperately to hide his number. 
Shane leans in with the next play. Cochran, playing right tackle, can't resist. 
COCHRAN You see. We should have prayed. 
SHANE Shut up! Pass. 22 Solo right slot 'A,' Y stick. On one. 
They break and come to the line of scrimmage. 
SHANE Twenty-two green.    Hut! 
Shane does a play action fake to Lamont and then turns downfield. 
Wham! He's buried by three defenders. The ball squirts loose and the Patriots recover. 
ON PILACHOWSKI 
He's livid on the sidelines. As his offensive line comes off he rants at them. 
Shane hobbles off past:

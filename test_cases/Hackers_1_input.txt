Plague is holding Dade's baseball bat. He shrugs, turns around, and smashes Dade's stereo to smithereens. 
DADE Shit! Come on! 
PLAGUE Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love. 
Plague replaces the baseball bat. 
PLAGUE I'll be in touch. 
Plague leaves. 
PLAGUE (to agents) I'm fine. (to Dade) Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay? 
DADE Blow me. 
PLAGUE (smiles) Thank you! 
INT. DADE'S ROOM. LATER. 
Dade is lying in bed. A door opens. It's Kate. She opens her motorcycle jacket, revealing her bare breasts. Dade starts to get up, she pushes him back own on the bed and starts kissing him passionately. He responds in kind. Then, Gill, Agent Ray and Agent Bob burst into the room, handcuff him, break the two up and haul them away as Plague looks on smugly. 
Then Dade wakes up in a sweat.  It was only a dream. He regains his composure.  The sound of New York City at night surrounds him. He goes back to sleep. 
INT. KATE'S PLACE. 
The party. A large, well-furnished apartment in an elegant old skyscraper in the fashionable part of town. Teenagers dance and writhe to loud, bassy music. Dade and Phreak arrive. 
PHREAK Her mom makes big bucks writing self-help books for women. Stuff like "Women Who Love Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae" 
Phreak shows Dade the book. 
DADE That explains a lot. 
Kate, the lovely and gracious hostess, mingles and greets her many guests, not noticing Dade or Phreak. Cereal offers Dade a drink from a plastic bottle. Dade, not knowing what he's in for, drinks. Nikon is the Deejay. 
PHREAK (loudly) Yo, what's up Nikon! 
NIKON Yo Phreak! Dade, man, you made it. (to Cereal) Houston, we have liftoff, 3 o'clock, check it... don't look right away, what's wrong with you! Look at her man... 
Nikon and Cereal are checking out a truly fine babe. 
NIKON (concentrating) Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM! 
DADE How did you know that? 
NIKON I got photographic memory. (Smiling) It's a curse! (Into the crowd) Lisa! 
LISA Hey, how do you know my name? 
Cereal and Phreak move through the crowd. Cereal notices something. 
CEREAL Oooo, look at that pooper man. Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right! 
INT. MEETING HALL. 
A 12-step recovery group. Addicts, including Joey Pardella, sit in a semi-circle. 
VICKIE Hi, my name is Vickie, and I'm an addict.

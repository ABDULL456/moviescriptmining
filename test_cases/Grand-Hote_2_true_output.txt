GERSTENKORN Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon! 
PREYSING I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags -- 
GERSTENKORN Mop rags --! 
Business between Preysing and Flaemmchen finding papers on 'Mop Rag' report. 
GERSTENKORN What we want to know about is Manchester. 
WAITZ Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know. 
PREYSING I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself. 
GERSTENKORN Oh -- Preysing, Preysing -- 
PREYSING No water -- What a place! 
GERSTENKORN All you have to do is phone for it. 
Flaemmchen, who is on her toes and busy every minute, rushes to the telephone and gives an order -- her conversation is heard over the conversation of the men in the room -- CAMERA HOLDS ON FLAEMMCHEN: 
FLAEMMCHEN Water -- seltzer, three or four bottles and cigars -- good ones. 
WAITZ I can see this session is going to be exhaustive. 
PREYSING Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious... 
GERSTENKORN Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us... 
PREYSING We did not approach you. 
WAITZ (quickly looking through the papers) Letter on file September fourteenth would show that you approached... 
PREYSING (snatching the document from his hand -- losing his temper) It isn't so -- this was a response to a tentative feeler of your own. 
GERSTENKORN (snatching the document violently away) Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door. 
PREYSING Scratched -- (he nearly chokes) We did not take the initiative. 
GERSTENKORN Of course you took the initiative. 
Zinnowitz enters the room. 
ZINNOWITZ Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway. 
PREYSING Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation? 
ZINNOWITZ But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me -- (he clears his throat) 
GERSTENKORN How clear is Manchester? 
ZINNOWITZ Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told. (to Preysing) Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing? 
PREYSING I can make no statement about Manchester at this time. 
ZINNOWITZ Well -- gentlemen. 
There is dead silence for a moment -- he clears his throat, commences in almost the same tone as Preysing. 
ZINNOWITZ Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger... 
GERSTENKORN (over Zinnowitz's voice -- with a sigh -- sits back) Thank God we're beginning at the beginning. 
ZINNOWITZ (stops suddenly -- takes glasses from his nose -- he is speaking, not reading) As you remember it -- when you approached us... 
GERSTENKORN (bangs the paper down) We did not approach you. 
PREYSING I know you did -- I said you did -- 
GERSTENKORN And I said we didn't. 
WAITZ And I know we didn't. 
During all this commotion Flaemmchen is paying no attention whatsoever. She is calmly spraying herself with a perfume atomizer and smiling at a gentleman. The noise continues over her. 
CUT TO: 
NO SCENE 61 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM 
The atmosphere has changed, the sun shines. Grusinskaya is reclining on the chaise-lounge -- her Chinese robe drawn about her. She speaks voluably. 
GRUSINSKAYA Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name. 
BARON I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix. 
GRUSINSKAYA Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you? 
BARON I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows. 
GRUSINSKAYA Really? 
BARON Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all. 
GRUSINSKAYA No?

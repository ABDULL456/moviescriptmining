He says it with such straightforward eye contact, that Harcourt (and we) know he isn't bluffing. 
JETSON Everyone up against that wall. Very slowly. (to Harcourt) Except you. 
Harcourt remains behind the desk.  Cassandra stays where she is, near Jetson.  The others move to the wall. Kipling in particular is going nuts, letting this happen. 
Jetson takes the "sample" dispenser from the table, tosses it into the suitcase, then closes the lid and locks it. All the while keeping his eye on Harcourt and the others. 
HARCOURT One small matter seems to have escaped your attention.  That-- (indicates suitcase) -- is not on any books as a controlled substance.  Legally it might as well be fifty kilos of... grape jelly. 
JETSON The charge is murder... and conspiracy to commit murder. Hubley, Porter, Strader... probably others. 
There's a flicker of concern behind Harcourt's icy blue eyes. 
Cassandra stares at Harcourt. 
CASSANDRA You... you killed Strader? 
Cassandra runs to Harcourt grabbing his jacket. 
CASSANDRA Where's Todd?!  Did you do something to Todd?! 
Harcourt looks down at her, totally uninvolved. 
HARCOURT Todd?  Who is Todd. (then remembers; smiles) Ah, poor Mr. Watson. 
Cassandra's eyes go wide as the horror of what he said sinks in.  Jetson nudges Harcourt with the suitcase.  They start out.  Cassandra, wild with rage, grabs Quint's .357 and with a KEENING WAIL, brings it up toward Harcourt's face. 
JETSON NOOO! 
Jetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun.  He manages to knock it away just as she fires -- the bullet going into the wall behind Harcourt.  Striking like a mongoose, Kipling leaps forward, grabbing the two lead wires on the bomb in Jetson's hand and jerking them apart. Jetson reacts an instant late... releasing the switch... and nothing happens. 
KIPLING I got it! 
Kipling tackles Jetson and they both go crashing to the floor.  Quint grabs the gun from Cassandra and hammers her with it, hard.  She drops to her knees and Quint viciously hits her again. 
Meanwhile, Jetson struggles to regain his feet.  Kipling rears back and delivers a crushing blow under Jetson's arm -- to the nerve plexus.  Jetson instantly folds over forward and Kipling savagely brings up his knee into Jetson's face, flipping him back.  Kipling slams him into the wall face-first, pinning him there. 
HARCOURT Kill them both. 
KIPLING Here? 
HARCOURT (raging) Do it! 
Quint brings the gun up, places the muzzle against the base of Cassandra's skull, starts to squeeze the trigger. There's a loud BLAM!  and Cassandra flinches... then looks up. 
Quint is blown backward away from her. 
Sykes stand in the doorway from the private office, the Casull smoking in his hand. 
Quint hits the wall behind him -- only it's not a solid wall, but the huge window overlooking the club.  He crashes through it. 
ANGLE FROM DANCE FLOOR 
as the wall of mirror explodes IN SLOW MOTION and Quint cartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds. 
ANGLE - IN THE OFFICE 
Kipling shoves Jetson aside, draws his gun and fires at Sykes. 
Sykes dodges into the private office for cover. 
The three Dealers dive behind any available furniture. 
Harcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door leading into the adjoining outer office. 
Sykes swings around the edge of the private office door, straight-arms the Casull into the office and fires. Kipling fires back, crossing toward the outer office door, covering Harcourt's back.  Sykes ducks back down. 
An unsteady Jetson rises from the floor, sees Harcourt and Kipling escaping, and takes off after them. 
Sykes straight-arms the gun into the room again... sees Jetson disappearing through the adjoining office door.  He moves into the room as the three drug Dealers, arms up in surrender, rise from behind the furniture.

GROUCHO (Throwing her a glance) And Vera niece, too. 
VERA Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom. 
GROUCHO You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? (Looking around) 
Bob (ZEPPO) enters scene. 
BOB Here I am, Father. 
GROUCHO (To Bob) Take a letter. 
BOB (Taking out a stenographer's pad and pencil) Who to? 
GROUCHO The President of the United States. 
Bob writes as Groucho dictates 
GROUCHO My dear President...  read it back... 
BOB (Reading from pad) "My dear President"... 
GROUCHO That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it. 
BOB (Reading) "My dear"... 
GROUCHO That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now? 
BOB (Reading) "My President"... 
GROUCHO There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got? 
BOB (Reading) "My"... 
GROUCHO Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read? 
BOB (Reading) "My dear"... 
GROUCHO You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds. 
BOB (Reading) "My dear President"... 
GROUCHO That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail. 
BOB Is that all?

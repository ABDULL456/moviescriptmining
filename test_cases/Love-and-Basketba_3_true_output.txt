QUINCY For what? 
MONICA Your heart. 
Quincy looks at her in disbelief, then laughs at the absurdity. 
QUINCY You're out of your mind. 
MONICA So you're gonna bitch up? 
QUINCY What's that supposed to be, psychology? 
MONICA I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you. 
QUINCY Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on. 
Monica moves past him, reaches through his window.  She drops back down, holding his basketball. 
MONICA Prove it. 
She throws him the ball. 
QUINCY What will this prove? 
MONICA You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to. 
QUINCY So? 
MONICA So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you. 
QUINCY And what happens when you lose? 
MONICA If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present. 
Quincy stares at her. EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SHORT TIME LATER 
Monica stands opposite Quincy.  Both are suited up in 
basketball gear. 
They stare at each other, ready to go to war. Monica tosses him the ball. 
MONICA Check. 
Quincy tosses the ball back.  Monica drives.  Quincy's knee is maybe at sixty percent and he can't keep up.  She scores easily. 
She walks to the top of the driveway, tosses him the ball. 
MONICA (cont'd) One, zip.  Check. 
Quincy rubs his scarred knee, then passes it back. 
The game continues.  Monica owns the first five points easily by exploiting Quincy's injury. 
Monica drives for another lay-up.  Quincy suddenly lets go of his fear, leaps and swats her shot. 
He grabs the rebound and lays it up.  He nods intensely, as he grabs the ball and walks back to the top of the key. 
QUINCY One, five.  Check. 
The game continues and now Quincy has the upper-hand, using his size and strength.  He scores seven straight points. 
The score stays close.  It is a sexually-charged battle of wills -- Quincy pulls off his sweat-soaked shirt.  Their bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball.  Monica yanks off her jersey in frustration.  Her ass bumps into his hips as she backs him in.  Her hands slide across his chest as she guards him... 
Finally, the score hits nine, nine.  Monica slowly walks to the top of the key. 
MONICA Nine, up.  Point. 
She tosses Quincy the ball. 
MONICA (cont'd) Check. 
Quincy tosses the ball back, drops low on defense.  Monica fakes an outside shot and Quincy bites.  Monica drives around him.  SHE HAS A WIDE-OPEN LAY-UP.  SHE PUTS IT UP..AND IT ROLLS OFF THE RIM.  Monica can't believe it. 
Quincy grabs the loose ball and clears it.  He stares at Monica as he dribbles in front of her.  She stares back. 
He breaks for the basket.  Monica stays with him.  He goes up.  Monica jumps, desperately tries to block his shot. Quincy dunks on her, knocking her to the ground.  He lets go of the rim, and tumbles to the ground also.  GAME OVER. 
Silence.  Quincy stares at her.  Monica looks back.  Then: 
QUINCY (pointed) All's fair in love and basketball, right? 
Monica struggles to fight back her tears as she picks herself up. She slowly walks back toward her house.  And then: 
QUINCY (cont'd) Hey. 
Monica slowly stops, turns. 
QUINCY (cont'd) Double or nothing. 
Monica stares at him, wonders if she heard right.  Quincy limps to his feet, picks up the ball and holds it out to her. 
Monica slowly walks back to him.  They stare at each other. No more egos, no more bullshit.  Just love.

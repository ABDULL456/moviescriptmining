He sinks his putt and walks toward the next tee, Gillis following him. 
GILLIS How's that about your being my friend? 
MORINO Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through. 
GILLIS Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off. 
MORINO Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write. 
GILLIS What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars. 
MORINO (Icily) Maybe what you need is another agent. 
He bends down to tee up his ball.  Gillis turns away. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
A-15    GILLIS IN HIS OPEN CAR GILLIS' VOICE driving down Sunset      As I drove back towards town towards Hollywood.  He   I took inventory of my pros- drives slowly.  His      pects.  They now added up to mind is working.          exactly zero.  Apparently I just didn't have what it takes, and the time had come to wrap up the whole Hollywood deal and go home.  Maybe if I hocked all my junk there'd be enough for a bus ticket back to Ohio, back to that thirty-five- dollar-a-week job behind the copy desk of the Dayton Evening Post, if it was still open. Back to the smirking delight of the whole office.  All Gillis stops his car at  right you wise guys.  why don't a red light by the main  you go out and take a crack at entrance to Bel Air.     Hollywood?  Maybe you think Suddenly his eyes fall   you could -- Oh-oh! on: 
A-16    ANOTHER CAR 
It is a dark-green Dodge business coupe, also waiting for the light to change.  but headed in the opposite direction.  In it are the two finance company men. They spot Gillis in his car and exchange looks.  From across the intersection Gillis recognizes them and pulls down the leather sunshade to screen his face. As the light changes.  Gillis gives his car the gun and shoots away.  The men narrowly avoid hitting another car as they make a U-turn into oncoming traffic and start after him. 
A-17    THE CHASE to A-21    Very short, very sharp, told in FLASHES.  (Use locations on Sunset between Bel Air and Holmby Hills). The men lose Gillis around a bend, catch sight of him and then -- while they are trapped behind a slow- moving truck.  he disappears again. 
A-22    GILLIS 
He is driving as fast as he dares, keeping an eye out for pursuit in his rear-view mirror.  Suddenly his right front tire blows out.  Gillis clutches desperately at the steering wheel and manages to turn the careening car into 
A-23    A DRIVEWAY 
It is overgrown with weeds and screened from the street by bushes and trees.  Gillis stops his car about thirty feet from the street and looks back. 
GILLIS' VOICE Was I far enough ahead? 
A-24    THE OTHER CAR 
shoots past the driveway, still looking for Gillis. 
A-25    GILLIS He watches his pursuers               GILLIS' VOICE shoot past and out of      Yeah... sight.  He opens the door and looks down at     I had landed myself in the the flat tire.  Then he    driveway of some big mansion looks around to see        that looked run-down and where he is.               deserted.  At the end of the drive was a lovely sight A-26    DRIVEWAY WITH GARAGE       indeed -- a great big empty garage, just standing there An enormous, five-car      going to waste.  If ever there affair.  neglected and     was a place to stash away a empty-looking.             limping car with a hot license number... A-27    GILLIS 
He gets back into his      There was another occupant in car and carefully pilots   that garage: an enormous the limping vehicle into   foreign-built automobile.  It one of the stalls.

The idea was to get Artie stone staircase which      Green's and stay there till I leads to the garden.       could make that bus for Ohio. CAMERA IN BACK OF HIM.

NORMA DESMOND'S HOUSE             GILLIS' VOICE It is a grandiose --   It was a great big white Italianate structure,  elephant of a place.  The kind mottled by the years,  crazy movie people built in the gloomy, forsaken,      crazy Twenties.  A neglected little formal garden   house gets an unhappy look. completely gone to     This one had it in spades.  It seed.                  was like that old woman in Great Expectations -- that Miss From somewhere above   Haversham in her rotting wed- comes                  ding dress and her torn veil, taking it out on the world be- cause she'd been given the go- by. 
A WOMAN'S VOICE You there! 
Gillls turns and looks. 
A-28    UPSTAIRS LOGGIA 
Behind a bamboo blind there is a movement of a dark figure. 
WOMAN'S VOICE Wlly are you so late?  Why have you kept me waitlng so long? 
A-29    GILLIS 
He stands flabbergasted.  A new noise attracts his attention -- the creak of a heavy metal-and-glass door being opened.  He turns and sees 
A-3O    THE ENTRANCE DOOR OF THE HOUSE 
Max von Mayerling stands there.  He is sixty, and all in black, except for immaculate white cotton gloves, shirt, high, stiff collar and a white bow tie.  His coat is shiny black alpaca, his trousers ledger-atriped.  He is semi-paralyzed.  The left side of his mouth is pulled down, and he leans on a rubber-ferruled stick. 
MAX In here! 
Gillis enters the shot.

Indy ROLLS HIS EYES. Meanwhile, Kezure has TAKEN all of Scraggy's tokens. He's obviously WON the game. A carefree Scraggy THROWS up his hands. 
SCRAGGY We play again? 
KEZURE (pause, serious) The game is not yet over, my friend. 
SCRAGGY Oh? 
KEZURE You have lost. You must pay. 
SCRAGGY (going through pockets) I don't have money... 
KEZURE No. No. money. (deadly smile) Rules of the game declare that I may choose a souvenir. (removes a knife) A part of your body. Any part I wish. 
Scraggy GULPS. Kezure PAUSES. RUBBING his jaw. THINKING. Meanwhile, Betsy EXPLAINS to Indians. 
BETSY Dr. Clarke says that you're not really in love with me. You're just trying to prove that you can still attract younger women. You're terrified of getting old. 
INDIANA That's crazy. 
BETSY That's what I told her. I told her that you really did love me. 
INDIANA (fumbling) Well...that's...ah...well... 
BETSY (worried) You mean... She was right?... 
INDIANA No... I mean Yes... I mean... 
Indy TURNS, seeing Clare GLARING at him. Indy SIGHS. PAUSES. He gives Betsy a TENDER, HONEST look. 
INDIANA No, Betsy. I don't love you. 
BETSY (tears fill her eyes) That's the first time you ever said it! 
Betsy begins CRYING. Into Clare's ARMS. Indiana SHAKES his head. Clare COMFORTS Betsy. 
CLARE There. There. He's a very disturbed man. 
Indiana SIGHS. He TURNS. FACE to FACE with a GRINNING and NODDING Gutterbuhg. 
Kezure has made his DECISION. Scraggy WAITS. TERRIFIED. Kezure RAISES his knife. TOWARD Scraggy's face. 
KEZURE Your eyes. They are a striking deep blue. 
Scraggy COVERS his face. Kezure ATTACKS him. Trying to CUT OUT Scraggy's eyes. A FIGHT begins. The crew members VS. the Pirates. Indiana TURNS, away from the controls. He BREAKS UP the fight. 
INDIANA (angry) Enough. We're in this together. If we start fighting among ourselves... we'll never get out alive. 
The men CALM DOWN. CATCHING their breath. Kezure PUTS AWAY his knife. He GLARES at Scraggy. 
KEZURE You owe me, old man. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN 
The tank, without a driver, begins to SWERVE OFF THE MOUNTAIN ROAD. 
INT. TANK 
Clare NOTICES the tank going over the mountain. She SCREAMS. 
CLARE Doctor Jones!!! 
Indy TURNS. LEAPING back to the controls. He hurriedly STEERS the tank back onto the mountain path. Saving it at the LAST MOMENT. Everyone CATCHES their breath. Indiana STEPS on the gas, continuing AHEAD. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MOUNTAIN - A FEW HOURS LATER 
The tank has nearly made it to the TOP of the mountain. Trekking through a NARROW, ROCKY RAVINE. The tank rolls to a STOP. The top hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indiana, Scraggy and Tyki POP OUT. Tyki suddenly points to the MOUNTAIN TOP, which is cloaked in thick LAYERS OF CLOUDS. Tyki's eyes fill with JOYOUS TEARS. He begins to SHOUT. His voice SQUEALS with EXCITEMENT. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indy. 
SCRAGGY He say that two miles ahead...we will find his home. 
Indiana SMILES. EXCITED by the prospects. TOUCHED by Tyki's reaction. Indy looks to the FOOT of the mountain. Several miles BELOW. 
THE NAZI FORCES 
have ARRIVED! They are still at least TWO HOURS from reaching Indiana and the others. The massive army MOVES FAST. They begin to DRIVE along the mountain path. FOLLOWING Indiana. In HOT PURSUIT. 
Indy PAUSES. WORRIED. THINKING. He LOOKS at the surrounding ROCKY WALLS, then to the tank's enormous GUN BARREL. An IDEA. He HURRIES back inside of the tank. Scraggy and Tyki FOLLOW. CLOSING the hatch above them.

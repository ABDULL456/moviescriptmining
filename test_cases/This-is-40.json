{"train": "THIS IS 40 \nWritten by \nJudd Apatow \nINT. MASTER BATHROOM - DAY \nPETE (39) and DEBBIE (39) are having fantastic sex in the shower. Debbie moans loudly. Pete is strong and sure of himself. In total control. \nDEBBIE Oh Pete! Oh my god! This is crazy! \nPETE Oh my god. So incredible. Want to know a secret? I took a Viagra. \nDEBBIE What? \nPETE I took a Viagra. Those things totally work. This is awesome. Why don't I use this every day? \nDEBBIE What? What did you do? Wait. Stop. \nDebbie gets out of the shower. Pete follows. \nPETE What's the matter? \nDEBBIE You just took a Viagra to have sex with me? \nPETE I thought it would make it better. It was better. It takes some of the pressure off. \nDEBBIE Because you can't get hard without a Viagra? Is it because you don't think I'm sexy? \nPETE I thought you'd think it was fun for me to supersize it for once. \nDEBBIE That is the worst birthday present you could ever give someone. \nPETE I was just trying to go turbo for your birthday. (MORE) \nPETE (CONT'D) My hard-ons are still in analog. This shit's digital. \nDEBBIE I don't want a turbo penis. I like your medium soft one. \nPETE Look, I can get it up. Just not that far up. \nDEBBIE Where did you get this? \nPETE I got it from Barry. \nDEBBIE What? You got it from Barry? \nPETE Why do you care? This is my dick we're talking about, not yours. \nDEBBIE We are young people. We don't need medication to have sex. \nPETE I only took it because it's your birthday. I thought you'd like it. Happy fucking fortieth birthday. \nDEBBIE I am not forty! And I don't want to have a husband who has to take Viagra to get a hard-on. \nPETE I don't have to take it every time, but once in a while... \nDEBBIE Fuck forty! Forty can suck my dick. \nTITLE UP - THIS IS 40 \nINT. HALLWAY/SADIE'S ROOM - MORNING \nPete sneaks down the hallway. He kisses SADIE (13) as he wakes her. She wants to be left alone. \nSADIE Your breath smells weird. \nPete breathes all over her as he talks. \nPETE Wake up, wake up. Time to get up. \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - MORNING \nPete lifts a sleeping CHARLOTTE (8) out of bed and walks her downstairs. It looks ridiculous because she is too tall to hold her like she is a baby. \nINT. BREAKFAST NOOK - MORNING \nPete and the kids set up a tray of muffins and donuts on the table and decorate the room with birthday balloons, streamers, etc. Pete sneaks bacon, cupcakes, and mini donuts into his mouth occasionally. The house is a bit more cluttered and messier than when we last saw it in Knocked Up. \nINT. MASTER BATHROOM - MORNING \nDebbie opens a window and sneaks a cigarette. \nPETE (O.C.) We're ready! \nShe holds her cigarette with a yellow dish washing glove. She puts out the cigarette and goes through an elaborate routine of hiding the smell of smoke. She puts some weird oil in her hair and uses a wet nap on her neck and clothes and brushes her teeth. She sprays cologne and walks through it. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nPete and the kids hold a cake and sing \"Happy Birthday\" as Debbie walks in. When they are done she blows out the candles on the cake which says \"Happy 38th Birthday.\" \nPETE Make a wish! \nINT. KITCHEN, TV AREA - MORNING \nThe kids eat cereal. Sadie watches Lost on her iPad while Pete and Debbie talk in the kitchen. \nCHARLOTTE Can I watch Lost? \nSADIE You can't handle Lost. It's too violent, and you won't understand. \nCHARLOTTE If I don't understand it, why can't I handle it? \nSADIE Because you're eight. \nWe see Pete in a large group of bikers riding down San Vicente. Pete's friend BARRY is part of the group. \nBARRY Hey, thanks for letting me join this team. \nPETE It's not really a team, it's just a bunch of guys who get together and ride. \nBARRY I know, I know. \nA car makes a right turn in front of Pete, nearly hitting him. Pete bangs on the back of the car. \nPETE Bike lane, asshole! It's always the guy in the fucking Infiniti. \nEXT. STREETS NEAR THE STAIRS - DAY \nDebbie is doing sit-ups while talking to Jason, who holds her feet down. In the background, Barb stretches on a yoga ball. \nJASON So why on earth is Pete taking Viagra? What's going on? \nDEBBIE I don't know. I think maybe he just isn't attracted to me anymore. \nJASON That is ridiculous. If you were my girlfriend, I would not need a Viagra. I would need an anti-Viagra pill. To try not to get a boner. \nDEBBIE But everyone gives you a boner. \nJASON Don't sell yourself short like that. You give me a boner. (whispers) Barb doesn't give me a boner. \nDEBBIE Maybe things are just getting stale. That's why maybe I work out really hard. Maybe he'll be able to get a boner again. \nBARB Why do you need to have sex, Deb? Sex is the number one thing people fight about. (MORE) \nBARB (CONT'D) You stop having sex, there will be no more fights. I am living proof. I have no sex, and I am the happiest I've ever been. \nJASON I knew it. I knew you were not having sex. I can see it on your face. It's all puckered and pained. \nBARB I'm enjoying our non-sex period, that's all I'm saying. \nJASON Don't you miss it? \nBARB Well, I wouldn't know, because I don't have any feeling down there anymore. I have nerve damage from my C-section so everything is just kinda- \nDEBBIE She's numb down there. \nBARB I could sit down hard on a fire hydrant, and I wouldn't even know that I was sitting. I could get stung by a hornet down there, and I would not feel it. You could put anything in there, and I would not know what the object was. I used to pee in a nice stream, and now it just kind of goes like a shower head. \nJASON That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. \nDEBBIE I think you need a family. Don't you want a family? \nJASON No, I think I want to Clooney it. \nDEBBIE Clooney it? \nJASON Yup. \nDEBBIE He doesn't seem happy. \nJASON Yeah, he is. \nDEBBIE No. He's lonely. \nJASON No, he's not. \nDEBBIE See, I think he has sad eyes. \nJASON Aw, you sweet little thing. He's doing sad, lonely eyes. To get the next lady. I can do it too, watch. \nJason demonstrates. \nDEBBIE I bet George Clooney is really lonely. Just him and his pig. \nJASON You'd fuck him. \nDEBBIE I wouldn't. \nJASON So would you. \nBARB I would. I wouldn't feel it but- \nJASON You'd fuck him with your numb vagina. Yes, you would. Ocean's thirteen inches, that's what you'd find out. \nDEBBIE Do you think? \nINT. STARBUCKS - MOMENTS LATER \nPete and Barry eat frosted scones, happy to get some alone time to delay their return home. \nBARRY I mean that was idiotic. You have to understand. That's like the one thing you don't do is tell her you used Viagra. I think that's even on the warning label. \nPETE We're in one of those phases where everything the other person says just annoys the shit out of each other. All the time. It's a blast. \nBARRY Don't worry about it. You just gotta ride that out. \nPETE This sounds terrible but do you ever wonder what it would be like if, say, you were separated by something bigger, like death. Like her death? \nBARRY I have given it a fair amount of thought. \nPETE Not in a painful way. Just quietly slid into death. Like a gas leak. \nBARRY Absolutely. It has got to be peaceful. I mean this is the mother of your children. \nPETE I'd want it to be a peaceful -- just like, drift, into a coma, from which she never awakens. \nBARRY Then you move on. Then you're a widower. \nPETE That's just it. People love widowers. \nPETE It's all dark up there. \nDEBBIE What? Why are you looking? \nPETE I didn't mean to look, I just said, `Hey- woah!' There it was. \nDEBBIE Maybe she's wearing dark underwear. \nPETE Yeah. Maybe she has underwear that has a picture of a vagina painted on it. \nDEBBIE Stop looking. \nDesi comes down to help a CUSTOMER at the front of the store. \nDESI Maybe some deep oranges and browns and maybe dark greens? That would really play up your features. \nCUSTOMER I'll just take out my AmEx and you pick what stuff you think is good. \nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY \nWe see quick cuts of Debbie playing with the kids on the trampoline outside. She does a full flip and lands on her feet. Pete is nowhere to be found. \nDEBBIE Woo! Where's daddy? \nSADIE I think he went to poop. \nDEBBIE Pete! \nINT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nDebbie walks down the hall and into the bathroom without knocking. Pete is on the toilet playing Scrabble on his iPad. \nDEBBIE What are you doing? \nPETE Going to the bathroom. \nDEBBIE We're all downstairs waiting for you. You've been up here for a really long time now. \nPETE Oh, I'm almost done. I'll be down in a second. \nDEBBIE Charlotte just did her first flip on the trampoline, and she landed on her feet. She was really proud of herself. \nPETE Oh, that's great. \nDEBBIE And you missed it. \nPETE She'll do it again. \nDEBBIE It's just that this is the fourth time you've gone to the bathroom today. \nPETE Give me a break. \nDEBBIE Why is your instinct to escape? \nPETE It's not my instinct to escape from you. It is my instinct to come into the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom. \nDEBBIE How come I don't smell anything? \nPETE It's because I shoved an Altoid up my ass before I came in here. \nDEBBIE Let me see then. \nPETE What? \nDEBBIE Let me see! \nPETE No, I'm not going to let you see. \nDEBBIE You're not going to let me see because you're not taking a poop. \nPETE I've been flushing as I go. \nDEBBIE You're flushing as you go? Who takes a half hour to go to the bathroom? \nPETE (thinks for a second) John Goodman. \nShe angrily grabs his iPad and walks out. \nPETE (CONT'D) Don't press Enter! I'm not sure I want to make that move! \nEXT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT \nA sign outside reads: \"Tonight Only: Graham Parker\" \nINT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - STAGE - NIGHT \nPete stands on stage speaking to a small crowd. \nPETE You know, when I started this label, my dream was to work with musicians and bands whose music I just admired so much. The person that I thought, \"My god, wouldn't it be incredible to work with\" was Graham Parker. Tonight we have him. Solo. Because we couldn't afford to fly in The Rumour. \nThe crowd applauds as Graham Parker (60's) leaps on stage. \nPete and Debbie watch Graham sing a very moving song. The song is fantastic and personal, but clearly not commercial. \nWe watch Debbie. Although the music is great, it's a little depressing and not working on her. She quickly gets bored. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nPete and Debbie are driving home. \nDEBBIE It's just not my kind of music. \nPETE Really. What is your kind of music? \nDEBBIE I like Lady Gaga. \nCHARLOTTE No. \nDEBBIE What? She's sweet. \nCHARLOTTE She's evil. \nINT./EXT. CHARLOTTE'S SCHOOL - MORNING \nAs they walk into class, the teacher pulls Debbie aside. \nTEACHER Hi. Listen, Charlotte really needs to get here on time because she needs the extra time to just settle in. \nDEBBIE Oh. We are on time. \nTEACHER Being on time means being early. \nDEBBIE Oh. Okay. \nTEACHER Well, it's nice to see you in class. We'd like to see more of you. \nDEBBIE I come to-- \nThe teacher walks away before Debbie can defend herself. \nGRANDMA MOLLY Hi Debbie! \nDEBBIE Hi, Grandma Molly. \nGRANDMA MOLLY How are you? I'm so happy about the science fair. It's going very well I heard. I love you. You look so beautiful. Happy birthday! I just learned it's your fortieth. Are you forty? \nDEBBIE Yeah. \nGRANDMA MOLLY I remember when I was forty, and then I blinked and there I was, going to be ninety. My god, where did it go? One day you're going to blink, and you're going to be ninety, and I won't be around to see it. And that makes me very sad. I'm telling you, I'm warning you. Don't blink. Don't blink. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY \nAs Debbie pulls out of the lot, she lights a cigarette. \nINT. PETE'S MUSIC LABEL - DAY \nPete paces around his office on the phone. \nACCOUNTANT (O.C.) And then you missed the mortgage payment, and that's the second mortgage. You've got to tighten your belt. You've got to go home, sit down, look at your expenses, come clean with Debbie. \nPETE Oh, god. I can't tell Debbie. \nACCOUNTANT (O.C.) You have to tell her, Pete. \nPETE She knows it's bad, but she has no idea just how bad. \nACCOUNTANT (O.C.) If you sell the house, it'll really buy you some time. \nPETE No. Debbie's not really into selling the house. \nACCOUNTANT (O.C.) As your business manager and your friend, I can't recommend that. (beat) Hey, how funny would it be if I bought your house? \nPETE Okay. Bye. \nACCOUNTANT (O.C) Hang in there. \nPete is with RONNIE and CAT, employees at his record label. They are watching an electronic press kit cut together for Graham Parker. There is a montage of him performing throughout the years from the seventies to the present. \nRONNIE What are you doing? \nCAT I'm contextualizing him as one of the great figures in rock history. \nRONNIE You can't show him in his prime in `77 and then jump straight to him as he is now. It's terrifying. You have to reverse it. You've got to show him as he is now very briefly, and then show him in 1977. You have to \"Benjamin Button\" it. \nCAT I don't know what you're talking about, okay? All rock stars are older now. Steven Tyler, David Bowie, Mick Jagger-- \nPETE Paul McCartney. \nRONNIE Okay, stop it. Everybody you're mentioning looks like an old woman now. You're just mentioning a bunch of Jessica Tandys. Keith Richards gets away with it. But that's because Keith Richards looked seventy when he was forty, and now that he's seventy, he looks sixty- nine. He's regenerating. \nCAT I like it. And I think Graham Parker is sexy. \nRONNIE Would you fuck him? \nCAT Yes. \nRONNIE You'd fuck him, and you won't fuck me? \nCAT I mean, I kind of fucked you once, if you could have finished. \nRONNIE Oh, I finished. \nPETE You know what, enough of who fucked who and who finished what. \nRONNIE I finished. \nPETE Look. It's a retro label. That's our niche. That's our market. It costs money to break new bands, I can't do that. \nRONNIE Oh, okay. And also you're the guy who turned down Arcade Fire. \nPETE Everyone turned down Arcade Fire. \nCAT It's crazy, there are so many of them! \nPETE We don't have the money to market a new band. We just need to make Graham seem relevant. Who is he talking to? \nCAT Um, the Jewish Journal. \nPETE The Jewish Journal? \nRONNIE Apparently old Jews are the only ones who still buy hard copies of records. Because they don't like to download music. Because they don't know what downloading means. \nPETE So, you're saying that if we're arguing and I apologize, you'll let it go and not throw it back in my face later? \nDEBBIE Well, I don't do that, but I will continue not to do that. What did you write? \nPETE All of that. That's plenty. That's a lot. \nDEBBIE And you're going to eat better? \nPETE Oh, yeah. I've been doing a decent job, but I don't think there's anything wrong with having some fries every now and again. \nDEBBIE And then I'll smoke that day. \nPETE That's not the same thing. \nDEBBIE It is the same thing. \nPETE I like fries. \nDEBBIE And the other thing is your dad stuff. \nPete picks up a guitar and starts playing with it. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) The not letting him guilt trip you all the time, because that puts a lot of pressure on you, and the whole family feels it. He's a grown man, and he's not our responsibility. And you're not giving him money anymore, right? \nPETE No, I haven't been giving him money for years, I told you. \nDEBBIE Can you please put that down? \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nPete and Debbie are in bed. Debbie has a computer on her lap. \nDEBBIE A lot of people are RSVP-ing to your birthday party. \nPETE You sure you don't want to just do a joint birthday party? \nDEBBIE No. \nPETE We always used to. \nDEBBIE No. \nWe reveal that Debbie is watching security cam footage of the store. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) Did Jodi tell you she thinks Desi's stealing? \nPETE Are you serious? \nDEBBIE Yes. \nPETE How much? \nDEBBIE Twelve thousand dollars. \nPETE Oh, god. And Desi's taking it? \nDEBBIE Well, I don't know. That's what Jodi said. \nPETE We really need the store to work. \nDEBBIE It is. Don't put that kind of pressure on me. \nPETE That's not what I mean. \nDEBBIE Are you nervous about money? Are we okay? \nPETE Yeah. Maybe we just suck it up because she's clearly earning so much more than any other employee we have. \nDEBBIE Oh, yeah. For sure. We can't fire her. We're barely breaking even with her. \nPETE That's why we have to keep her. \nWe watch the footage and suddenly Desi's BOYFRIEND enters. He walks behind the counter, and she sits on his lap. She adjusts herself. \nDEBBIE Look at this, she's making out with somebody. \nOn the screen, they kiss. Desi seems to be popping up and down a little. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) Is she screwing him?? \nPETE That might be like a dry hump. \nDEBBIE Look at the position of her skirt. \nPETE That's too grainy to know for sure. Oh my god, this is the middle of the day. Customers could be in there. \nDEBBIE At least she's getting some. \nPETE What did you say? \"At least she's getting some\"? \nDEBBIE Yes. \nPETE What are you talking about? We had sex the other night. You have to give me a little credit for that. \nDEBBIE It's not about credit. We need to have more passion. Like this. \nPETE That's not passion. \nDEBBIE It looks like passion to me. \nPETE What-- \nPete farts. \nPETE (CONT'D) What is she doing? \nDEBBIE I don't know. \nDR. PELLIGRINO Do you have a tree and everything? \nDEBBIE Yes. \nDR. PELLIGRINO Isn't that fun. Get in the spirit-- \nTwo nurses enter the exam room. \nNURSE #1 Hi, sorry I just have one quick question. On your form you said you were born in 1974, but your paper said 1972. I just need to know which it is. \nDEBBIE Oh. It's 1974. \nNURSE #2 Because on your last form you said that you were born in 1975. \nDR. PELLIGRINO Didn't you tell me you were born in \nDEBBIE No. That's funny. \nNURSE #2 So you want to go with 1974? \nDEBBIE I'm not going to \"go\" with 1974, it is 1974. \nNURSE #2 Okay. Just remember to write 1974 every time. \nDR. PELLIGRINO It's okay. It's 1976. \nDEBBIE I lie about my age, okay? \nDR. PELLIGRINO Okay. \nDEBBIE Okay? Okay? Okay?! \nDR. PELLIGRINO You're tightening up. \nDEBBIE Oh my gosh. \nDR. PELLIGRINO I know how old you are. By counting the rings! Little gyno joke. \nINT. BEDROOM - LATER \nDebbie comes in the bedroom. \nDEBBIE What are you doing? \nPETE Getting ready to go for my ride. \nDEBBIE You want a blow job? \nPETE Yeah. Why? \nDEBBIE I really want a cigarette right now. \nPETE Well, happy to help. \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nSadie runs down the hallway. \nSADIE Charlotte, where is my backpack? \nINT. OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCharlotte tries to open the door, it's locked. \nINT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nDebbie is giving Pete a blow job out of frame. Pete is sitting on a chair, super happy. \nCHARLOTTE (O.C.) Hello? \nPETE Mom's busy! \nCHARLOTTE (O.C.) Why are you locking the door? Mom! \nINT. OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCHARLOTTE What's going on in there? \nSADIE Mom, I can't be late for school, I have a test! \nPETE (O.C.) Mommy can't talk right now! \nINT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSADIE (O.C.) This isn't funny, Mom. I need to go. \nCHARLOTTE (O.C.) Mom, let me in! \nINT. OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSADIE That's not going to help. \nCharlotte shoves Sadie. \nPETE (O.C.) Put on your shoes. We'll meet you in the car. \nThe fight between Sadie and Charlotte escalates and becomes physical. \nINT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCHARLOTTE (O.C.) Sadie hurt me! \nSADIE (O.C.) I didn't! \nLARRY Claire takes care of your brothers. What do you want her to do? If she goes to work, then I've got to hire somebody. \nPETE Well you've got to figure something out because I can't do it. \nLARRY Okay, fine. Why don't we kill them? Come on, we'll kill two of them. I'll keep the best one. Really, it will save us both a lot of trouble. \nLarry stands up and walks outside. Pete follows. \nEXT. LARRY'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS \nLarry prepares to spray the kids with the hose. \nLARRY Line up! Line up for murder! Come on! Who wants to be killed? \nTRIPLET #1 I do! \nLARRY Okay, we're eliminating one, we're cheaper already. \nLarry sprays him with the hose. \nTRIPLET #2 Murder me! \nLARRY Boom, dead. You're dead. \nTRIPLET #2 I'm dead! \nLARRY All right, the kids are murdered. That will save us some money. \nPETE Why would you have three kids, anyway? I mean, you're sixty years old. You have no money. \nLARRY Because Claire wanted a baby. If we didn't at least try, she would have left me. She was forty-five years old. Nobody thought it would take. (MORE) \nLARRY (CONT'D) The doctor when we were doing in vitro was winking at me like, \"Don't worry, don't worry.\" We were very unlucky. And now we have these three beautiful children... Come on, I've got to tell you something. \nINT. LARRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nPETE What? \nLARRY Your mother wanted you aborted. \nPETE Oh, Jesus Christ. \nLARRY It's the truth. It was the seventies. We were twenty-two years old. That's what everybody did. You did some blow, had sex, had an abortion. \nPETE Really. \nLARRY Yes. We were on the way to the doctor's office. I said, \"Let's stop, have a pizza, talk about it, if you still want to do it after lunch, it's okay.\" The pizza saved your life. But don't give me money. Because I'm not worth it. \nPETE So how much do I owe you for saving my life? \nLARRY I don't have a number. You just keep giving like you're giving. \nLarry's wife, CLAIRE, enters. \nCLAIRE Oh, hi Pete. (to Larry) Why aren't you playing with kids? \nLARRY We were playing with them all day. Pete's just talking to me about his fortieth birthday party... Whatever I can do to help. \nCLAIRE Okay. Did you feed them? \nLARRY I fed half of one. Okay, let's feed them. Who wants tuna with a side of jet fuel? \nLarry gets up and walks outside. \nINT. RESTAURANT - DAY \nA nervous Debbie approaches a hostess. \nDEBBIE Hi, I'm looking for my dad, an older man? \nDebbie sees OLIVER (65) sitting stiffly at a table. \nINT. RESTAURANT - LATER \nOLIVER So how's Sony treating Pete? \nDEBBIE Oh, he's not with Sony anymore. He went out on his own. Now he's able to focus on the artists that he's really passionate about. \nOLIVER How's Sadie doing? Last time I saw her she was throwing her Cheerios on the floor. What a mess. \nDEBBIE She just got her period. \nOLIVER Well. I guess she's not a little baby anymore. \nDEBBIE It would be nice to see more of each other. \nOLIVER Well, we can certainly arrange for that. I'd love to see the girls. \nDEBBIE That would be nice. Do you have a good day? \nOLIVER I would say the weekends, but our weekends are hell. Soccer competitions, kids exams. I mean, we're both so busy. I have young children, you have young children. I don't think we should judge ourselves too harshly about that. \nDEBBIE I know, I wasn't. I'm glad we're here. I think this is a good start and that if we can spend more time together, it would be nice. \nOLIVER It would be nice. (pause) Do you want to see pictures of the kids? \nOliver takes out his iPhone and starts showing Debbie photos. \nOLIVER (CONT'D) This is Kell, my son. \nDEBBIE He's handsome. He's thirteen? \nOLIVER Yeah. And that's Alexandra, my daughter, she's a real perfectionist. A lot like you. That's the whole gang at Cabo. (pause) Will you excuse me, dear? I've got to use the restroom. Be right back. \nHe exits. Debbie picks up his iPhone and sadly scrolls through all the happy pictures of his new family. \nPete and Debbie drive down the Pacific Coast Highway. \nDEBBIE This is the best birthday present. \nPETE It's good to get away, you know? We haven't been to Laguna without the kids in years. \nINT. PETE AND DEBBIE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nDEBBIE I know! \nPETE If we're happy, they're happy. \nDEBBIE I mean I can't take it. With the hormones, and the crying, and \"do my homework\"... \nPETE Them's little bitches. \nDEBBIE Them's lil' bitches! Bugging us for shit all the time. And they never appreciate anything. \nPETE God no. They're selfish assholes. \nDEBBIE (laughs) Aw, I feel bad. I love them. \nPETE I know. \nEXT. LAGUNA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS \nThe car pulls up to a beautiful hotel in Laguna. \nDEBBIE I miss them already. Should we go home? \nPETE Nah. \nLAGUNA HOTEL - MONTAGE \nPete and Debbie hold hands as they walk the hotel grounds. \nThey enter their room, which has a beautiful ocean view. Debbie jumps on the bed. Pete jumps on top to kiss her. \nPete and Debbie jump into the hotel pool together. \nPete holds Debbie in the water. They kiss. \nINT. LAGUNA HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nPete and Debbie are in bed in their underwear. \nDEBBIE Why do we fight? \nPETE I don't know, it makes no sense at all. \nDEBBIE It makes no sense. \nPETE When we get in a fight, look in my eyes. Let's remember this moment right now and know that we never have to fight. \nDEBBIE But you're such a dick sometimes. \nPETE I know, I am a dick sometimes. People think I'm so nice, but I'm such a dick. \nDEBBIE Thank you for admitting that. \nPETE And you get so mad at me. I feel like you want to kill me. \nDEBBIE I do want to kill you. \nPETE How would you do it? \nDEBBIE I don't know... poison you. I'd poison your cupcakes that you pretend not to eat everyday. And just put enough in to slowly weaken you. \nPETE I love it. \nDEBBIE I would enjoy our last few months together. \nPETE Me too. \nDEBBIE Because you'd be so weak and sweet, and I could take care of you but while killing you. \nPETE See? You know what I love about us? You can still surprise me. I figured for sure you'd knock me out with one fell swoop. But you would extend it over a series of months. \nDEBBIE Have you ever thought about killing me? \nPETE Oh, yeah. \nDEBBIE Really? \nPETE Sure. \nDEBBIE How would you do it? \nPETE Wood chipper. \nDEBBIE A wood chipper? \nPETE Did you see Fargo? \nDEBBIE Yeah. \nPete makes a wood chipping splatter noise. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) Wow. That's a bad plan. The cupcakes is a way better plan. \nPETE It is. You know what? I won't murder you. \nDEBBIE Aw. I love you. \nPETE I love you too... Hey. You know what I brought? \nPete and Debbie drive back from Laguna. They could not look happier or more refreshed. They hold hands and smile at each other. It is a beautiful day. \nThey pull up to their house, shut off the car and sit for a beat, knowing they're about to head back into the stress of the real world, not wanting their peaceful, loving time to end. \nPETE That was nice. \nDEBBIE That was nice. \nSadie walks outside. Jodi follows her. \nSADIE Mom! Charlotte's crying. She's got an ear infection again. \nJODI I didn't know what to do. \nPETE (to Debbie) We're home. \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - DAY \nCharlotte is crying really hard. \nDEBBIE Are you okay? What's the matter? \nCHARLOTTE I just want to rip my ear off, it hurts so much. \nDEBBIE (to Pete) I told you the pediatrician didn't know what he was talking about. \nPETE Oh, come on. You can't blame it on our doctor. Ear infections are common in little kids. \nDEBBIE Not in kids over six years old. We're going to the Eastern doctor. \nPETE If she's in this much pain, we should call a real doctor. \nDEBBIE Are you kidding right now? \nPETE Okay. \nINT. DOCTOR SEDUKU - DAY \nCharlotte sits on the table. Pete and Debbie are talking to DR. SEDUKU, a foreign doctor. \nDOCTOR SEDUKU What we should do is easy and simple. No more dairy, no more wheat, no more sugar. \nDEBBIE Sugar, wheat and dairy. Okay. \nPETE (mutters) What the fuck is left? Sorry. Isn't everything sugar, wheat and dairy? \nDOCTOR SEDUKU She can have vegetables and f-r-ruits. \nDr. Seduku has both an accent and a lisp. \nPETE Oh, she can eat fr-r-ruits. \nDOCTOR SEDUKU Fr-r-ruits, yes. \nPETE Any kind of fr-r-ruits? \nDOCTOR SEDUKU Mangos, pineapple... \nPETE It isn't like there are safe fr-r- ruits and then unsafe fr-r-ruits. \nDOCTOR SEDUKU No, no. \nPETE What about F-r-r-rench f-r-r-ries? Can we do something like that? \nDOCTOR SEDUKU Are you okay? Would you like to come on the table? \nPETE I'm okay. \nDEBBIE Why don't you go on the table? \nPETE No. \nDEBBIE Why don't you go on the table? It looks like you need to get on the table. \nPETE I don't want to get on the table. \nEXT. BRENTWOOD - DAY \nPete cycles with the crew. \nINT. HOUSE - DAY - LATER \nDebbie looks around the house for Pete. \nDEBBIE Pete! \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nDebbie sees Pete on the bed, his legs up in the air. He still has his bike top on but is naked from the waist down. \nHe is trying to look at his back end. He is holding a mirror and an iPhone. \nDEBBIE What are you doing? \nPETE I need you to look at something. In my butt. \nDEBBIE Why? \nPETE I think I've got something in there, and I'm not limber enough to see. I need you to look at it. I might have like an anal fissure or a hemorrhoid or a worm or something. \nDEBBIE What are you doing with your phone? \nPETE Trying to take pictures of it, so I can compare it to something on Google. \nDEBBIE Can we just keep like a small shred of mystery in our relationship? \nLarry and Debbie greet the kids when they enter the kitchen. Larry picks up one of the triplets. \nLARRY Did you miss me Travis? \nTRIPLET #1 It's Jack! \nLARRY Hey, Jack. \nTRIPLET #1 My daddy doesn't know my name. \nCHARLOTTE Can I go show them my crystals before they leave? \nDEBBIE Yeah, really quick. \nCharlotte leaves with the triplets. \nLARRY Go play with your tiny uncles. (to Debbie) So, what are you doing, spring cleaning? \nDEBBIE I'm getting rid of everything in the house that has gluten or sugar. \nLARRY Why? What's wrong with gluten? \nDEBBIE Gluten's really bad for you. \nLARRY I don't think so. It's wheat. \nDEBBIE Don't you watch Dr. Oz? \nLARRY As in the Wizard of? \nSADIE Hey, Mom. We were wondering if we could use the computer to iChat. \nDEBBIE Remember the rules? Eight to eight- thirty? \nSADIE Yeah, but I have a friend over. \nDEBBIE Hi Wendy. Why don't you guys go play? You could go build a fort! \nLARRY Remember the Alamo? \nDEBBIE Have you ever built a fort, Wendy? \nWENDY Like on Facebook? \nLARRY I will take this if you're going to throw it away, because at our house, we're wheat eaters. \nDEBBIE But don't you want to live long enough to see your kids grow up? \nLARRY That's up to god, honey. \nDEBBIE But that's really not good for the kids. \nLARRY The kids eat grass. This is fine. \nLarry takes some of the food she's throwing out. \nSADIE Wendy's mom lets her go on whenever she wants. \nWENDY My mom's pretty cool about it as long as I finish my homework. \nDEBBIE Yeah. Well, I guess I'm not the cool one. But the rules are just different in our house. \nSADIE But I get better grades than Wendy. \nWENDY She does. She's so smart. \nLARRY Let me just grab the candy worms. \nSADIE Your rules are ridiculous. \nDEBBIE Don't sass me. \nSADIE I'm only sassing you because you're throwing out all the food in our house and I'm freaking starving. You're being stupid. \nDEBBIE Wendy, can you go stand in the other room, please? \nWENDY Yeah. \nWendy exits. \nSADIE (whispers) Mom. \nDEBBIE Give me your iPhone now. \nLARRY The nougat things are good. \nSADIE I have all my contacts in there. \nDEBBIE Okay, if you don't give me your phone right now, then I'm going to have to take away your phone and your computer. \nSADIE Jesus Christ-- \nDEBBIE That's it. \nSADIE I need my computer to do homework. \nDEBBIE No phone, no computer. \nSADIE This is B.S. This is a bunch of F- ing S. You're acting like a B. \nLARRY Kids! Time to go! \nDEBBIE You go to your room right now. \nSadie runs off. \nJOSEPH Sadie...? \nDEBBIE Sadie, the one you chat with on the internet? \nJOSEPH Nah, man. That ain't me. \nDEBBIE Well, it was you, I saw your picture. Did you make a \"Hot\" list and not put Sadie on the \"Hot\" list? \nJOSEPH She was not on my list, no. \nDEBBIE You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to make my own \"Hot\" list, and you know what? You're on the \"Not Hot\" list. How does that feel? \nJOSEPH It doesn't bother me. I'm comfortable with the way I am. \nShe gets even quieter, scarier and more in his face. \nDEBBIE Maybe you shouldn't be so comfortable with yourself. You know why? You look like a miniature Tom Petty. How's that feel? Huh? You think that haircut's cool? It's not. It looks like you put your Justin Bieber wig on backwards. You still comfortable with yourself? Why are you wearing a tank top? Huh? So you can show off your bald pits, you little hairless wonder? Cool tank top, man. So next time you think about writing something nasty on my daughter's Facebook page, just remember me. Remember me. I will come down here, and I will fuck you up. \nJoseph looks upset. \nJOSEPH Okay, I'm sorry. \nDEBBIE Wait a minute. Hey. Are you crying? \nJOSEPH Just let me go. \nDEBBIE I'm sorry. I'm not in my right head. \nJOSEPH I understand. My mom is going through menopause, too. It's a hard time. \nDEBBIE What did you say? \nJOSEPH You're going through menopause? \nDEBBIE I'm not going through menopause! I'm not going to go through menopause for twenty years. I'm pregnant you little bitch. God damn it! \nShe storms off. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT \nDebbie pulls open the door, Pete is on the toilet playing on his iPad. \nDEBBIE I'm going out to coffee with Desi to find out if she's stealing from us. \nPETE I've got the Graham Parker concert. Who's gonna watch the kids? \nDEBBIE I don't know. Figure it out. \nDebbie exits. Pete flips her off after she's gone. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nDebbie and Desi are talking as they walk down the stairs into a loud club. \nDEBBIE I just wanted to talk. Maybe we could go to a coffee house or something? \nDESI You want coffee? This place has coffee. They have all kinds of drinks. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nDebbie and Desi talk to a group of young men, PROFESSIONAL HOCKEY PLAYERS. \nDESI What sport do you guys play? \nHOCKEY PLAYER We play hockey. \nDESI Oh, I like hockey. \nDEBBIE Who do you guys play for? \nHOCKEY PLAYER We play for the Philadelphia Flyers. \nDEBBIE You guys are all from Philadelphia? \nHOCKEY PLAYER No, actually none of us are. \nDESI Do you guys still have all of your teeth? \nHOCKEY PLAYER #2 Well, I've got all my teeth, except for these ones. \nHe takes a plate of his teeth out. \nHOCKEY PLAYER #2 (CONT'D) Want to try them on? \nDesi takes them and tries to put them in her mouth. Everyone laughs. \nDESI Do I look sexy? \nDesi looks insane. She tries to kiss Debbie. Everyone is laughing. \nHOCKEY PLAYER #3 They definitely look way better on her than they do on you. \nShe hands the teeth back to their owner. He pops them back in and everyone cheers. \nDEBBIE So, should we go to the quiet area? \nHOCKEY PLAYERS No, no. \nHOCKEY PLAYER #4 Where are you going? \nDEBBIE We kind of have to have a little business meeting tonight. \nHOCKEY PLAYER Business meeting? You have to celebrate with us. We won tonight. \nDESI I want to party with these winners, come on Deb. \nBillie Joe comes over to congratulate Graham. \nBILLIE JOE Graham, hey, what's up? \nGRAHAM Billie! \nBILLIE JOE How you doing, man? Great show. I'm inspired. I want to write a song right now. \nGRAHAM Inspired, huh? That inspires me. \nBILLIE JOE Let's go get a drink. \nGRAHAM Let's get a drink. \nBILLIE JOE (to Pete) You coming? \nPETE No. I'm fine. You guys go. Congratulations on Glee. \nThey walk away. \nBILLIE JOE You got a song on Glee? That's killer, man. That's so much money, that's good for all of us. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nPete sits in the car crying. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nDebbie is dropping Desi off at her apartment. \nDEBBIE Why did you put that guy's teeth in your mouth? That's so gross. He was dirty. \nDESI No, he was wearing a tie. \nDEBBIE That's true. \nDESI When I kissed him, I felt his little tiny teeth nubs with my tongue. \nDEBBIE You did? \nDESI It was like kissing a baby. French kissing a baby. \nDEBBIE Can I ask you something stupid? Do you know why we're missing money at the store? \nDESI Are you guys missing money? \nDEBBIE Like twelve thousand dollars. \nDESI Wait. Do you think I took it? \nDEBBIE Well, no. I did, but now I don't. \nDESI It's not me. \nDEBBIE Then, why do you live in such a nice apartment and have such a fancy car? \nDESI Yes, you're right. Look. I... am an escort. I get paid to go out on dates. \nDebbie looks shocked. \nDESI (CONT'D) But only three to five times a year. Ten times max. But it's not technically \"prostitution\" because I don't have to sleep with them. \nDEBBIE Well, that's good. \nDESI But I always do. That's why I only do it four to eight times a year, fifteen times max. \nDEBBIE Huh. \nDESI One year I did it twenty. \nDEBBIE As long as you think it's safe. \nDESI It's safe. I only do it ten to thirty times a year. \nDEBBIE So, who do you think is stealing money? \nDESI It's Jodi. \nDEBBIE No. \nDESI Yeah. She's a pilled-out whore. \nDEBBIE Since you told me, I want to tell you something. \nDESI You're pregnant. \nDEBBIE How did you know? \nDesi nods. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) Wow. Maybe you should tell Pete. \nDESI You didn't tell Pete yet? Why not? \nDEBBIE I don't know. I just want him to want me. I don't want him to want me because I'm pregnant. \nDESI Go home and suck his dick and tell him then and he will love it. \nDEBBIE You think? \nDESI He'll be so excited. Or even better yet, you should tell him while you're sucking his dick. (mimes a blow job) \"I'm pregnant.\" \nINT. BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING \nPete on his iPad laying in bed. Debbie comes in to talk. \nPETE Simon controls him. \nDEBBIE That's because Simon writes the fucking songs! He's the better one. \nPETE You know what? I see the way you look at our kids. You have so much love and compassion for them. You never look at me like that. Ever. \nDEBBIE Would we even still be together if I didn't get pregnant fourteen years ago? \nPETE I'm not going to go down that road. \nDEBBIE Would we? \nPete doesn't say anything. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) Okay. \nDebbie starts walking away. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) You know what? I don't even want to have a party here. You need to cancel it. \nPETE No, I'm not. I already paid for the catering, I put down deposits, and I`m not going to call everybody back in two days when change your mind. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThey all are laying in bed watching Spongebob Squarepants. It is tense. Charlotte is licking her fingers. \nSADIE Can you please stop licking your fingers? \nCharlotte does it more. \nSADIE (CONT'D) Do you know how many germs are on your hands? And you're putting them into your mouth. It's gross. Stop. \nCharlotte pokes Sadie with her wet fingers. \nSADIE (CONT'D) I'm going to kill you! \nPETE Hey! Sadie, enough! She isn't hurting anyone. If you want to say something, keep your mouth shut. \nDEBBIE You have never been nice to her and now she's getting aggressive with you. I told you this would happen. \nSadie leaves and slams her door. \nCHARLOTTE I'm sick of everybody fighting. \nCharlotte leaves. \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nCharlotte writes a note at her desk. \nINT. HALLWAY/SADIE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nCharlotte walks by Sadie's room. She puts the note up on the door.

LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nSadie sits alone watching Lost on an iPad. \nINT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER \nDebbie rests next to Charlotte in bed. \nDEBBIE What do you think you're going to be like when you grow up? \nCHARLOTTE I don't know. \nDEBBIE Do you think you want kids? \nCHARLOTTE Just one. \nDEBBIE Just one? Why? \nCHARLOTTE Because if I have two then the one will fight with the other one. \nDEBBIE Does it make you sad when you fight? \nCHARLOTTE I don't want anyone to fight. \nDEBBIE I love you. \nINT. FAMILY ROOM - MORNING \nPete is sleeping on the couch. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nPete sits at the counter. Debbie and the kids are at the breakfast table. \nCHARLOTTE Why isn't anybody talking? Why is it so quiet? \nPETE It's the sounds of silence. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nPete is driving Sadie and Charlotte to school. On the stereo is \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light\" by Meatloaf. Pete is eating an egg sandwich and manically singing along. \nPETE (singing) I don't think that I can really survive... I'm praying for the end of time, it's all that I can do. Praying for the end of time, so I can end my time with you. \nSADIE Stop, Dad. \nPETE It was long ago and it was far away, it was so much better than it is today. \nJODI Meow. \nDEBBIE Jodi. You put me in danger. Me and my family. \nJODI It was a cry for help. Help. (getting weirder) Help. Why don't you help me? Just help. Help. Why don't you help me? \nDEBBIE Are you high right now? \nJODI (weirder) Help me. \nDebbie's phone buzzes. \nJODI (CONT'D) Is that about me? Is that the cops? Is this a set-up? \nDEBBIE I need to go. \nJODI Okay, see you later. (creepily) Fuck you, Debbie. Fuck. You. \nINT. VICE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY \nPete and Debbie are sitting across from VICE PRINCIPAL LAVIANI. In another seat is Joseph's mother, Catherine. \nMS. LAVIANI Joseph was very upset when I spoke to him about this, so I thought it was important that we join together and work this through. \nPETE Absolutely. \nCATHERINE We're going to work through it, but Debbie told my son that he looked like Tom Petty, in a negative way-- \nPETE Who's Tom Petty? \nCATHERINE You know who Tom Petty is. And she said that if she had to come back, that she was going to \"F up his pussy ass.\" Which is what she said. \nDEBBIE Are you serious? I didn't. I would never. To a child? Your son has been defiling my daughter's Facebook page now for months. \nCATHERINE These people are liars. He said that my son was an animal and that if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car. \nMS. LAVIANI Did you say that? \nPETE That's ridiculous. Who talks like that? \nCATHERINE You do. \nDebbie tries to hide a smile. \nDEBBIE He didn't say that. \nCATHERINE He said it. To me. \nPETE What I said was that we need to keep an extra eye on our kids because with all the technological advances, they need to learn to use them responsibly. \nCATHERINE No. He called me an \"iCunt.\" \nPETE A what? \nMS. LAVIANI Language, Catherine! \nCATHERINE How am I going to relay what these two nutballs said to me unless I say it. \nMS. LAVIANI Can you please not talk like that, Catherine? Music Man is rehearsing next door. \nCATHERINE Sorry, fucking Music Man. Maybe if I looked more like this fake bullshit couple, looks like they're in a bank commercial. That's what you look like. Like a bullshit bank commercial couple. \nMS. LAVIANI None of this talk is productive. \nCATHERINE I'd like to rear up and jackknife my legs and kick you both in the jaw with my foot bone. \nDEBBIE You're just really scaring me. \nCATHERINE This is what happens when you corner a rat. You corner me, I will chew through you. \nMS. LAVIANI Catherine, you're better than this. \nCATHERINE Fuck you, Jill. You're a horrible woman. This is why everybody hates you. This kind of shit. Ineffective. Bullshit hair. And I'm glad your husband died. Because you're a fucking asshole. He probably killed himself. \nMS. LAVIANI Okay, Catherine. I think we know what's happening now. \nDEBBIE Now you know what we're dealing with. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY \nPete and Debbie leave the school together, surpressing smiles. They get in separate cars and drive off. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nDebbie is making dinner. Pete and Charlotte sit at the table. \nCHARLOTTE I'm not going to eat that chicken. \nDEBBIE Why not? \nCHARLOTTE Because I feel like I'm going to be a vegetarian. \nDEBBIE Can you become a vegetarian tomorrow? \nCHARLOTTE No. \nSadie storms in. \nSADIE You guys have been reading my texts? \nPETE No, we haven't. \nDEBBIE Yes, we have. We're supposed to keep an eye on you. \nPETE How did you find out? \nEXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS \nLARRY When was the last time you two saw each other, if you don't mind me asking? \nOLIVER Actually, we had lunch together last week. \nLARRY And before that? \nOLIVER It's been about seven years. \nLARRY Seven years? That's a joke, right? That's like two Olympics. And I'm the bad guy. What Debbie doesn't understand is that it's not bad to help out a parent. And it's certainly not bad for a parent to help out a child. I'm sure Oliver would agree. \nDEBBIE Are you really doing this right now? \nLARRY Am I doing what? I didn't start the toast. \nDEBBIE Are you really about to hit up my dad for money? \nLARRY What? He does four operations a day. It's perfect. It helps everybody, and it relieves his guilt from all the abandonment issues. \nDEBBIE You can't buy forgiveness, right Pete? \nPETE I don't think anyone's looking for handouts... We'd pay him back. \nOLIVER If you two are in a bind I'd be more than happy to help. \nDEBBIE No. It's not good to borrow money from family members because it causes resentment, remember? \nPETE Yeah. \nLARRY What do you want me to do? Admit that my life is shit? Is that what you want me to say? You happy? Aren't I allowed a little joy with these children I never wanted to have? \nDEBBIE You have never once stopped asking us for money. \nLARRY Family helps family. \nPETE It's true. Family helps family. Look, I don't expect you to fully understand. Your dad left. You're broken inside. It's not your fault you can't feel love. There's something that you can't -- this is coming out wrong. \nDEBBIE You know what? I would rather have my dad than your dad, because he doesn't drive me crazy. You know the best quality my father has? He asks for nothing. I don't know what the fuck he's thinking right now. Look at that. Nothing. I don't even know him. And I turned out perfectly fine without his input. \nLARRY I just figured out what your problem is. You hate Jews. Which is so odd because your children are Jewish. \nDEBBIE Don't play the Jew card, Larry. \nLARRY I'm not playing any Jew card. \nDEBBIE Seriously, it's used up. \nLARRY You can't use up a Jew card. That's the whole point of a Jew card. \nBARRY That's right. You can't use it up, it goes forever. \nOLIVER You know what? I have to go. \nOliver gets up to leave. \nPETE Great. What a big surprise. Bye Oliver. See you later. See you in another seven years. Make sure to say goodbye to the grandkids, who you met today. You know, nothing I do is right because of you? Nothing. No matter how hard I try, I'm just the asshole here, but you know what I realized? It's you. You're the asshole. \nOLIVER Good luck working that out. Happy birthday and go fuck yourself. \nOliver walks out. \nLARRY See you when the Cubs win the Pennant. \nBARB I'm going to light the candles. Get it going. \nLARRY Maybe we should try the toast again. \nDEBBIE Can you be quiet? (to Pete) You just threw me under the bus. \nPETE No. We agreed to let go and forgive, but then you started ripping into my dad like a crazy person. \nDEBBIE I'm not ripping into your dad. I'm just saying to him what you say to me. \nPETE Don't be such a ball buster. \nDEBBIE I am not a ball buster. You make me one! I am a fun girl! I am fun- loving! I am a good time Sally! I dance hip-hop. I cannot believe I've wasted my whole life busting the balls of people who have no balls. I am the only one here who has any balls. \nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY \nGraham Parker sings \"Happy Birthday\" to Pete as Charlotte accompanies him on a keyboard. The party is tense. \nDebbie looks over and sees that Oliver never actually left. He stands in the back looking uncomfortable, quietly singing. She's shocked he's still there. \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY - LATER \nDebbie smokes a cigarette at the side of the house. Sadie appears. \nSADIE Mom? \nDebbie turns, caught. \nSADIE (CONT'D) Mom! What are you doing? \nDEBBIE What? \nSADIE You're smoking? In the front yard? \nDEBBIE No, they're Barb's. \nShe walks away towards the house. Sadie follows. \nINT./EXT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS \nSadie storms through the front door after Debbie. \nDebbie is stunned. \nDEBBIE I don't even know you. You can't just come into my house and reminisce. \nOLIVER (walking out) Look, maybe we were just not meant to be in each other's lives. I'm not sure this was such a great idea. \nDebbie follows him out the door and onto the front porch. She closes the door behind them. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS \nDEBBIE Hey, wait a minute. You did leave. And you didn't come back. \nOLIVER (getting agitated) My first life was ruined. I did my best with my second. \nDEBBIE So I ruined your life? I was eight. \nOLIVER People do better when I stay out of their lives. That's what my son tells me. You think my life is so perfect? I've got a thirteen-year- old who's a pot head, I've got a wife who's keeping Zoloft alive. \nDEBBIE You never said that before. \nOLIVER You don't think I want to talk to you about this? To share it with you? It's just not our way! We don't talk to each other, we don't know each other. I thought that's the way you wanted it. How do I get out of this? How do I get you all to just help me down off the cross? \nDebbie looks at him for a moment. \nDEBBIE You sound just like Sadie. \nOLIVER Who's Sadie? No. Your daughter, your younger? \nDEBBIE The big one. \nOLIVER Your older. I know that! She's a wonderful girl. \nLarry opens the door and peeks out. We reveal that everyone at the party (except Pete) is still standing in the foyer. \nLARRY Hi, guys. Some of us need to leave. Would this be a good moment to sneak out? \nFrom the side of the house we see Pete storming by on his bike, wearing his street clothes and a helmet. \nSADIE Where's Dad going? \nEXT. CITY STREETS - DAY \nPete exits his home riding his bike. He is very angry. He rides with great emotion like he is trying to get all the frustration out of his body. \nPETE Best birthday ever! \nPete rides his bike onto San Vicente Boulevard. \nPete rides down the street. A CAR passes by him. When it does a fifteen-year-old TEENAGER sticks his head out the window and yells to scare Pete. \nTEENAGER Bike lane, asshole! \nPete almost falls. \nPETE Fuck you, you Twilight pimply-ass motherfuckers! \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nDebbie and Barb are cleaning up. They look out the window to see Oliver picking up glasses and putting them in a bin. \nBARB Your dad's still here. \nDEBBIE I know. It's weird. Where the hell is Pete? \nSadie walks in with Joseph. \nSADIE Mom, is it okay if Joseph hangs out here for a while? \nDEBBIE Sure. Hi, Joseph. \nJOSEPH Hi. \nDEBBIE Do you want a piece of cake? \nJOSEPH Oh, yeah sure. Thank you. \nSadie walks off. \nJOSEPH (CONT'D) All right, then. \nJoseph follows. \nBARB They are so cute. \nDEBBIE So cute. \nBARB He looks exactly like Tom Petty. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nThere is no bike lane and cars going very fast have to swerve to avoid Pete. A car honks when traffic clogs up behind him. \nPETE Go around! \nA car makes a right turn, and Pete almost rides right into it. \nPETE (CONT'D) Watch it! \nHe pulls up alongside Jason's van. Desi is riding with Jason. \nDESI Hey, Pete. Great party! \nThey speed off. \nPETE Yeah. The best! \nMAN IN RANGE ROVER Don't disrespect me. \nINT. DEBBIE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS \nDebbie watches Pete fall to the ground. She opens the car door and starts to run over toward him. \nLARRY Are you sure that's him? I don't think that's him. \nEXT. STREET- CONTINUOUS \nAs the man starts his engine, Debbie runs toward Pete. \nPETE (in pain) I'm going to write down your license plate number. \nThe car drives away, revealing that it is new and has dealer's plates with no numbers. \nPETE (CONT'D) \"Range Rover of Sunland.\" \nDebbie reaches him and holds his head up. \nDEBBIE What are you doing? \nPETE Ow. \nINT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nDebbie and Larry sit in the waiting area of the hospital. \nLARRY I guess the party didn't turn out like you planned. \nDEBBIE It wasn't a good party. \nA NURSE walks over to them. \nNURSE Hi. I'll bring you in as soon as his x-rays are finished. \nDEBBIE Is he okay? \nNURSE Yeah, he has a broken rib and he's been crying a little bit, but he'll be fine. \nThe Nurse walks away. \nLARRY You know Pete was never a real fighter. But that's why he married you. That's why he loves you. Because you're the fighter, and you need that. One person in a relationship has got to punch. \nDEBBIE Do you mean that in a good way? \nLARRY Oh, it's a high compliment. \nDEBBIE Thanks. \nLARRY Listen, I know what you're worried about. You think he's going to turn into me, but I don't think it's going to happen. He's smarter and probably a little cuter. A little less Jewy. Although, after fifty, that's all going to change. Be prepared to wake up one day with a a rabbi. But the good news is, he'll love you forever. That's in our DNA. We stick around. \nDEBBIE He worries about you. It puts a lot of pressure on him. \nLARRY I know. I just don't have anyone else to talk to about it. \nDEBBIE You can talk to Claire. \nLARRY No. If I open up to her she'll leave me. \nDEBBIE No, she won't, Larry, she loves you. \nLARRY I know, but there's a certain point at which you just can't stay. (beat) I guess it's hard to forgive somebody if they don't formally apologize to you. \nDEBBIE Are you apologizing? \nLARRY I'm very close. (beat) Yes, I'm sorry. And I'm glad everybody's okay. \nDEBBIE Thanks. \nShe hugs him and starts to cry a little bit. \nLARRY I'm off. \nDEBBIE Okay. \nLARRY This is awkward. \nDEBBIE What? \nLARRY I need forty dollars for a cab. \nDEBBIE (laughing) That's funny. \nLARRY No, I'm not kidding. You drove me. I wasn't prepared. \nDEBBIE I only have a hundred. \nLARRY That's okay. I'll bring you the change. \nHe grabs the bill out of her purse and walks off. \nLARRY (CONT'D) All right, give him a kiss for me. \nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nOliver is sitting on the couch with Charlotte and Sadie watching the last scene of Lost. Joseph has joined them. \nOLIVER I don't get it. \nSADIE See, it's not sad, it's happy because they helped each other achieve their destiny. \nOLIVER Oh. \nCHARLOTTE Great. I'm going to have some freaky ass nightmares. \n", "test1_input": "ACCOUNTANT We heard. \nDEBBIE You heard. \nACCOUNTANT And they're bad. You know, it's that, and it's the money that he's been lending to his father, that's creating a strain. \nDEBBIE How much have we lent him? \nACCOUNTANT Eighty thousand. \nDEBBIE Did you say \"eight thousand\" or \"eighty thousand\"? \nACCOUNTANT Eighty thousand, over the past couple of years. And then you missed the mortgage payment-- \nDEBBIE On the house? \nACCOUNTANT And you missed the rental on the office. \nDEBBIE Does Pete know that? \nACCOUNTANT Oh, yeah. We're on the phone all the time. Look, I know you're going through a hard time, and I want you guys to know that we're here for you, okay? Anything you guys need, that's why we're here. We're here for times like this. \nDEBBIE What are you going to do? \nACCOUNTANT There's not much I can do. \nINT. RECORD LABEL - MORNING \nPete enters and walks into Ronnie's office. Ronnie is drawing on a blackboard behind his desk. \nPETE What are you doing? \nRONNIE I'm drawing the album cover for Van Halen's Diver Down. \nPETE If you spent a little bit more time focusing on Graham Parker instead of drawing album covers, I wouldn't be in this predicament. \nRONNIE I'm focused on Graham Parker. \nPETE You're supposed to help me with him! (MORE) \nPETE (CONT'D) You're supposed to call the companies, you're supposed to get people to the show! \nRONNIE I've done everything I can, Pete. You had me pushing around a corpse. It was like being in fucking Weekend at Graham's. \nPETE What should we do? I'm out of ideas. \nRONNIE You fly in The Rumour. I can't sell a reunion concert without the band. It's ridiculous. \nPETE With what? I can't afford it. \nRONNIE You put this on yourself. You wanted the responsibility, take it on the chin, and stop acting like a bitch. \nPETE What did you call me? \nRONNIE Chin. \nPete walks out of Ronnie's office and into the main office space. Ronnie follows. \nRONNIE (CONT'D) Pete -- wait. I have an apartment, I have health insurance, I have car payments. I have responsibilities. \nPETE Don't talk to me about responsibilities. I have a life. I have a family. I can't afford to sit in my apartment getting high, jerking off, and then going to Tommy's Chili Burgers at three in the morning. \nRONNIE That's not even the order that happens in! \nPETE I have everything to lose here. Everything. \nRONNIE Yes. Because you spent thousands of dollars on shit we don't need. You really need to spend thirty thousand dollars on a fucking neon sign, dude? Which is inside? It's not even outside. We know where we work. \nPETE If you want to sign a band, you have to look like you're the real deal. \nRONNIE (to Cat) Princess Labia, how much is it to fly The Rumour in? \nCAT It's twelve thousand. \nRONNIE Twelve thousand dollars! \nPETE You know what? Fine. Fly in The Rumour. Put it on my AmEx. \nINT. GYNECOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nDebbie sits in Dr. Pelligrino's office. \nDEBBIE No, you said it was impossible. \nDR. PELLIGRINO I don't think I said it was impossible. \nDEBBIE Yeah. \nDR. PELLIGRINO I usually don't say impossible. I like to leave some wiggle room. \nDEBBIE You said that my fibroid was like a giant boulder, like the one from the Indiana Jones movies blocking up my uterus. \nDR. PELLIGRINO And I need to stop using that reference of Indiana Jones. I think that's not appropriate when talking about the reproductive system. \nDEBBIE It's okay. \nDR. PELLIGRINO Anyway, somehow the Eastern medicine has worked and the fibroid has dissipated. \nDEBBIE That's great. \nDR. PELLIGRINO Yes. Your fibroid shrunk, and somehow it allowed you to get pregnant. \nDEBBIE What? \nDR. PELLIGRINO You're going to have your third baby. Congratulations. \n", "test1_true": "DR. PELLIGRINO Yes. \nDebbie does not react. \nDR. PELLIGRINO (CONT'D) Would you like some water? \nDEBBIE That's good news. Another baby, at forty. \nDR. PELLIGRINO Debbie? \nDEBBIE I am thrilled. And Pete is going to be so happy. \nDR. PELLIGRINO So, you're okay? \nDEBBIE What a relief. I can finally relax now, you know? I'm so happy, I really am. It's good. \nDR. PELLIGRINO Great. Great. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nDebbie drives. We cannot tell what she is feeling. Then after a few beats, a joyous smile appears across her face. \nINT. RECORD LABEL - PETE'S OFFICE - DAY \nPete takes a framed item off of his wall. \nEXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - DAY \nLarry answers the door. Pete is there with a framed drawing made by John Lennon. \nPETE Hey, why are you in a bathrobe? It's the middle of the afternoon. \nINT. LARRY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nLARRY I took a late shower. Why are you busting my balls? Look, I'm sorry about the record. You're going through financial shit. This is what I live with. This is a horrible time in human history. What is that? \nPETE Something that might help both of our situations. \nPete hands him the drawing. \nPETE (CONT'D) This is a drawing by John Lennon. I got it ten years ago for five thousand dollars. I don't know how much it's worth now. Could be five, could be twenty. \nLARRY I don't want this. I don't even like it. I'm not going to hang it up. \nPETE It's not for you to hang up. It's for you to sell. That way I can give it to you and you can make some money, and Debbie doesn't know that I'm giving you anything. \nLARRY Well, you're not giving me money. You're giving me a project. I don't know how to sell this. I'm not an art dealer. \nPETE Just sell it online. Do some research, make some calls. Or is that too hard to do with your high blood pressure? \nLARRY All right. Don't get snippy. Just because you write a great song doesn't mean you can draw. \nPETE It's incredible. John Lennon drew it. \nLARRY I think it's a Ringo. Don't beat me up if I get three hundred dollars for it. \nPETE Don't take less than sixty-five hundred for that. It's very valuable. It's important to me. I want you to sell it so I can help you. \nLARRY Okay. \nPETE I'll see you at my party. \nLARRY What should I bring? You want wine or something? \nPETE No. Don't buy wine with my money and give it to me at my party. \nLARRY That's mean. \nPETE I love you. Bye. \nLARRY All right. Bye... How do I call eBay? \nINT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY \nSadie and a bunch of other kids are building sets for a school play. Sadie talks with a FRIEND. \nPete and Debbie are watching from afar, sitting next to each other. Debbie tries to gently break the news. \nDEBBIE She's so cute. She's so tall. \nPETE I know. How did that happen? \nDEBBIE Do you ever wish we had a bigger family? \nPETE No, never for a second. Never. \nDEBBIE Never? \nPETE Never. I love what we have. One? A breeze. Two? Brutal. Three? Put a bullet in my head. \nDebbie is totally deflated. \nPETE (CONT'D) I think about that gray-haired pregnant lady from school and I just feel bad for her. And I feel bad for the kid. Can you imagine? All the other little kids, \"Where's your mommy?\" \"Oh, she's the one sitting in that scooter eating a soft cracker.\" Kids don't want to have old parents. You know, it would also be nice for us to spend some time apart. Kind of rediscover who we are individually. It would be so great to not see you for like a chunk of time so that I could really just miss you. Remember when we used to miss each other? \nEXT. SCHOOL - DAY \nDebbie is walking through the campus upset. She sees a kid and darts over to him. \nDEBBIE Hey! \nJOSEPH (13), the kid who insulted Sadie on her Facebook, turns and sees Debbie. \nJOSEPH Yo, sup? \nDEBBIE I'm Sadie's mom. \n", "test2_input": "The shades are closed and the room is dark. Sadie watches the end of the last episode of Lost on a laptop. Pete enters. \nPETE What are you doing? We need to get ready for the party. \nSADIE (devastated) I just finished the last episode of Lost. \nPETE We don't have time for this right now. We have a lot of people coming over-- \nSADIE (losing it) They're all dead. \nPETE What? \nSADIE Jack, Kate, Sawyer... \nPETE I don't care about the show right now- \nSADIE Jin, Sun... \nPETE Okay? I need you to just get in the shower. Get dressed. Let's just put it on hold. \nSADIE Walt, Juliet. All those people. \nPETE Don't think about Lost today. Tomorrow: Lost. All day. I can't wait to hear about it. Jack? No way. Really? Right now, shower. \nSADIE I don't make fun of your stupid Mad Men. \nPETE First of all, I don't get worked up over Mad Men. \nSADIE That's because Mad Men sucks. \nPETE What Don Draper has gone through beats whatever Jack is running from on some island. \nSADIE A bunch of people smoking in an office, it's stupid. \nPETE You're getting me off topic. Please get dressed. \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nDebbie is speaking with Barb as they set up the kitchen for a barbecue for Pete's fortieth birthday. \nDEBBIE I am so glad you're here. I need a buffer in case it gets weird. \nBARB Well, I'm ready to buff. \nDEBBIE Here, grab these napkins. \nINT./EXT. HOUSE - DAY \nDesi jumps in the pool in a small bikini. She is playing in the water with the kids. \nANGLE ON BARRY AND PETE \nBARRY So that's the girl who works for you. \nPETE Yeah, that's her. \nBARRY Seems nice. My wife would never let me have a hot employee like that. (MORE) \nBARRY (CONT'D) Everyone that works for us looks like they've been in some kind of horrible accident. \nAngle on Barb and Debbie. \nBARB You're comfortable with that around your husband? \nDEBBIE Pete wouldn't know what to do with that. \nAngle on Barry and Pete. \nBARRY You think our wives are looking at us right now? \nPETE Oh, definitely. \nAngle on Barb and Debbie. \nDEBBIE They look like pedophiles. \nBarry and Pete turn toward their wives, smile and wave. \nINT. KITCHEN - LATER \nPete greets guests, including Graham and Grandma Molly. \nEXT. BACKYARD - LATER \nPete and Ronnie are talking in the backyard. \nDEBBIE (O.C.) Hey, Pete! \nDebbie walks over with Jason. \nDEBBIE (CONT'D) Jason's here. \nJASON Peter, hi. \nPETE Hey, how's it going? \nJASON Great, you look well. How do you like what I've been doing to your girl? How do you like Debbie's after body? \nRONNIE It's nice. \nJASON Come on, show `em. Look at this. (points to her ass) It's beautiful. Look at that after- ass. Now it starts here, but it used to start here. And I brought it up. You're welcome. \nRONNIE Are you a trainer? \nJASON Yes, well, but not just physical. Spiritual. I'm sort of a guide. \n", "test2_true": "They leave Ronnie and Jason alone. The guys spot Desi swimming in the pool. \nJASON Who's that in the pool? \nRONNIE Mine. \nINT./EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY \nDebbie and Pete open the front door. Standing there is Oliver.

They do not hug. \nDEBBIE Remember my husband, Pete? \nOLIVER Oh, yes. I didn't recognize you with the long hair. \nPETE (people pleasing) I've been growing it. \nOLIVER Happy birthday. \nHe hands him a bottle. \nPETE Thank you so much. \nOLIVER Very old scotch. \nPETE Oh, wow. You know, I hope it hasn't expired. \nOLIVER No, scotch doesn't expire. It improves with age. \nPETE No, I know. Thank you so much. \nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY \nThe party is in full swing. Pete, Debbie, Oliver, Barry and Barb are getting food from the buffet. Barb and Barry are trying to help keep the conversation going. \nBARRY What do you do in Chino, Oliver? \nOLIVER I am a surgeon. \nBARB Wow, what kind? \nOLIVER Mainly of the spine. My specialty is scoliosis surgery. \nBARRY My mom used to talk to me like I had scoliosis because I'm a little hunchy, but that's a different thing. \nOLIVER Well, you definitely don't look right. \nLarry arrives, with Claire and the triplets. Claire is holding two of them, while Larry carries one. \nThe triplets now have very different HAIRCUTS so he can tell them apart. One has a faux hawk, one has bangs, and one has a buzz cut. \nLARRY Hello everyone! I'm sorry we're late. I was in the lab cloning myself. We're going to have another seven more tomorrow... Look, we cut their hair different so we can finally tell who they are. \nLarry lifts one of the triplets up and down by the arms, simulating an elevator. \nLARRY (CONT'D) You like the new haircut, Travis? \nTRIPLET #1 I'm Jack, damn it. \nLARRY Of course you are. \nLarry puts Jack down and he runs off. \nDEBBIE Larry, this is my father. \nLARRY Really? How are you? \nOLIVER Oliver. \nLARRY Oliver. \"Can I have some more? Please, Oliver, I need a little morsel.\" I love that movie. You must get that all the time. \nOLIVER Not really. \nCLAIRE I'm Claire, Larry's wife. Very good to see you, but excuse me, I'm going to go get the kids. \nClaire runs off. \nLARRY We won't see her now for the whole day. I'd help honey, but I've got the blood pressure, and I don't want to. \nPETE Dad, you want a drink? \nLARRY Yeah, a little white wine. \nPETE White wine? Okay, heavy stuff. \nLARRY So, who knew that Debbie had a dad! Where have you been for fifteen years? Never seen you at Hanukkah, Christmas, Ramadan, nothing. How do you get out of all that stuff? Do you have a wife? \nOLIVER My wife is at home. \nDEBBIE Why didn't she come? \nOLIVER Construction. They're sanding our deck. \nLARRY You let the woman sand the deck? \nOLIVER She supervises it, yes. \nSadie, Charlotte and Desi walk over. \n", "test3_input": "DEBBIE Hey guys. \nLARRY Look how big the kids are. Sadie! \nHe gives Desi a hug. \nDESI Hi, Larry. \nLARRY (to Sadie) Hi, Sadie. \nSADIE Mom. Who is Oliver? \nDEBBIE What do you mean? \nCHARLOTTE Is he your dad? \nDEBBIE He is my biological father. \nCHARLOTTE What does that mean? \nDEBBIE He and my mom had a baby and that was me. \nSADIE Oh, so you're our grandpa. \nOLIVER Why don't you ask your mother? \nDEBBIE Yes, well, that would make him your grandpa. Do you want him to be? \nCHARLOTTE Yes. Then we get another grandpa. Come on! \nOliver gets up. Charlotte, Sadie and Desi run off. Oliver follows. \nLARRY That was deeply uncomfortable. Thank god the pretty girl was here to divert our attention. \nEXT. POOL - DAY \nDesi is gracefully swimming under water. She looks gorgeous. She sees Jason and Ronnie under water, but they look grotesque, red-faced and awkward. They both reach for each other and come to the surface. \nJASON Oh, hi. I did not see you there. \nRONNIE I saw you there. \nDESI Did you guys come together? Are you a couple? \nRONNIE / JASON No, we didn't come together. Absolutely not. \nDESI Sorry, the mustache is a little-- \nJASON That's fair. \nDESI I just assumed. \nRONNIE This is a straight man mustache. \nDESI What is the different between a gay man's mustache and a straight man's mustache? \nPause. \nJASON The smell. \nDESI Excuse me. \nDesi swims away. \nEXT. BACKYARD - LATER \nLarry is talking to Oliver. \nLARRY So, spinal surgery just seems to me to be at the top of the surgery chain. \nOLIVER Well, we're not cardio, we're not neuro, but I like to think we're an important part of the spectrum. \nLARRY Do you operate every single day? \nOLIVER Most days. \nLARRY Multiple times a day? \nOLIVER Three, four times. \nLARRY So what's the price range? Like if I wanted-- \nOLIVER Oh, I'd rather not say. \nLARRY It's so big you're embarrassed to say. \nOLIVER I wouldn't say embarrassed. \nLARRY Are there hunchbacks today? \nOLIVER Of course. \nLARRY I've never seen one. \nOLIVER Well, that's because there are spinal surgeons. \nLARRY That's because of you. Each time I don't see a hunchback, you're getting that much richer. \nOliver smiles, amused. \nLARRY (CONT'D) You like The Beatles, don't you? \nOLIVER Who doesn't like The Beatles? \nLARRY Nobody. \n", "test3_true": "Jason and Ronnie are talking to Desi. \nDESI So what's your sun sign? \nRONNIE Libra. \nJASON Oh, boy. \nDESI That's not good. \nJASON No, sir. \nDESI Not for me, that's not good. Sexually we are completely incompatible. \nRONNIE That's not true. \nJASON That's such a shame. That's as bad as it gets. \nDESI What's yours? \nJASON I'm a Cancer. \nDESI Really? \nJASON Is that good? \nRONNIE What does it mean? \nDESI That's really strange. Well, Taurus and Cancers are sort of soul mates of the Zodiac. We're like perfectly compatible. I balance what you lack, and you make up for what I lack. And a quiet Cancer almost always has a huge penis. \nJASON (quietly) You're making me embarrassed. \nEXT. BACKYARD - LATER \nDebbie, Pete, Larry, Oliver, Barb and Barry are eating. \nDEBBIE I wanted to make a toast. Thank you guys so much for coming... Pete's turning forty. \nPETE Weird. \nDEBBIE And we're ready to start this new phase of our lives with open hearts. Ready to just choose joy and forgive everybody, so thank you all for coming. \nLARRY Wait. Forgive who? \nPETE I think she just meant generally. You know? Put the past behind us. \nDEBBIE And live without resentments. \nLARRY But specifically who are you forgiving? I like to know the details before I toast. \nDEBBIE Well, you and my dad and others. \nLARRY I see. I know you have some issues with me, but I'm curious, what's he in for? Before today nobody even knew he existed. \nDEBBIE My parents divorced when I was really young and we don't spend that much time together and I'd like to work on that. Just like we'd like to work on how you have financial issues. \nBARRY (to Larry) She means all the lending. And the borrowing... \nLARRY I know what she meant. \nEXT. POOLSIDE - CONTINUOUS \nRonnie, Jason, and Desi talk. \nJASON You are a beautiful woman, but you are not totally maxed out. I would say honestly, you're a six. Six and a half. I could make you an eleven. \nDESI Really? \nJASON When I found Deb, she was a seven. And now she's a twelve. \nDESI I want to be a twelve. \nJASON You can't be lazy. \nDESI I don't want to be lazy. \nJASON Look at me. You cannot be lazy. \nDESI I won't be lazy. \nJASON Do you know how she got her body? Bodies By Jason. \nDESI Wow. \nJASON Say it. \nDESI Bodies By Jason. \nJASON Say it again. \nDESI Bodies By Jason. \nJASON And now just say Jason. \nDESI Jason. \nJASON Again? \nDESI (whispers) Jason. \nJASON That sounds right, doesn't it? \nDESI Yeah. \nRONNIE What the fuck is happening right now? \n"}

Listen, Charlotte really needs to get here on time because she needs the extra time to just settle in. \nDEBBIE Oh. We are on time. \nTEACHER Being on time means being early. \nDEBBIE Oh. Okay. \nTEACHER Well, it's nice to see you in class. We'd like to see more of you. \nDEBBIE I come to-- \nThe teacher walks away before Debbie can defend herself. \nGRANDMA MOLLY Hi Debbie! \nDEBBIE Hi, Grandma Molly. \nGRANDMA MOLLY How are you? I'm so happy about the science fair. It's going very well I heard. I love you. You look so beautiful. Happy birthday! I just learned it's your fortieth. Are you forty? \nDEBBIE Yeah. \nGRANDMA MOLLY I remember when I was forty, and then I blinked and there I was, going to be ninety. My god, where did it go? One day you're going to blink, and you're going to be ninety, and I won't be around to see it. And that makes me very sad. I'm telling you, I'm warning you. Don't blink. Don't blink. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY \nAs Debbie pulls out of the lot, she lights a cigarette. \nINT. PETE'S MUSIC LABEL - DAY \nPete paces around his office on the phone. \nACCOUNTANT (O.C.) And then you missed the mortgage payment, and that's the second mortgage. You've got to tighten your belt. You've got to go home, sit down, look at your expenses, come clean with Debbie. \nPETE Oh, god. I can't tell Debbie. \nACCOUNTANT (O.C.) You have to tell her, Pete. \nPETE She knows it's bad, but she has no idea just how bad. \nACCOUNTANT (O.C.) If you sell the house, it'll really buy you some time. \nPETE No. Debbie's not really into selling the house. \nACCOUNTANT (O.C.) As your business manager and your friend, I can't recommend that. (beat) Hey, how funny would it be if I bought your house? \nPETE Okay. Bye. \nACCOUNTANT (O.C) Hang in there. \nPete is with RONNIE and CAT, employees at his record label. They are watching an electronic press kit cut together for Graham Parker. There is a montage of him performing throughout the years from the seventies to the present. \nRONNIE What are you doing? \nCAT I'm contextualizing him as one of the great figures in rock history. \nRONNIE You can't show him in his prime in `77 and then jump straight to him as he is now. It's terrifying. You have to reverse it. You've got to show him as he is now very briefly, and then show him in 1977. You have to \"Benjamin Button\" it. \nCAT I don't know what you're talking about, okay? All rock stars are older now. Steven Tyler, David Bowie, Mick Jagger-- \nPETE Paul McCartney. \nRONNIE Okay, stop it. Everybody you're mentioning looks like an old woman now. You're just mentioning a bunch of Jessica Tandys. Keith Richards gets away with it. But that's because Keith Richards looked seventy when he was forty, and now that he's seventy, he looks sixty- nine. He's regenerating. \nCAT I like it. And I think Graham Parker is sexy. \nRONNIE Would you fuck him? \nCAT Yes. \nRONNIE You'd fuck him, and you won't fuck me? \nCAT I mean, I kind of fucked you once, if you could have finished. \nRONNIE Oh, I finished. \nPETE You know what, enough of who fucked who and who finished what. \nRONNIE I finished. \nPETE Look. It's a retro label. That's our niche. That's our market. It costs money to break new bands, I can't do that. \nRONNIE Oh, okay. And also you're the guy who turned down Arcade Fire. \nPETE Everyone turned down Arcade Fire. \nCAT It's crazy, there are so many of them! \nPETE We don't have the money to market a new band. We just need to make Graham seem relevant. Who is he talking to? \nCAT Um, the Jewish Journal. \nPETE The Jewish Journal? \nRONNIE Apparently old Jews are the only ones who still buy hard copies of records. Because they don't like to download music. Because they don't know what downloading means. \n", "test1_true": "INTERVIEWER Why is this album different from any other album? \nGRAHAM It isn't. \nAngle on Pete, Cat and Ronnie. \nPETE What is he wearing? \nCAT It's a hat with the Oreo logo on it. \nPETE Why? \nCAT I don't think he's being ironic, I think he just really likes Oreos. \nPETE Look. The Paul Westerberg record did okay. Frank Black did all right. The Haircut 100, not so much. We have to break this record. Otherwise, we're not here next year. \nRONNIE He's coming. Oreo man is coming. \nGraham walks up. \nGRAHAM Hey guys, how are you? \nRONNIE Aren't cookies the best? \nGRAHAM Yeah. Jewish Journal guy loves the record. \nPETE Great! \nGRAHAM Got a bit of a problem. Touch of gout. \nPETE Gout? \nGRAHAM Yeah, my whole family, they all had gout. \nPETE Jesus. \nRONNIE That's very unfortunate. \nGRAHAM My auntie Queenie, she had a foot like the size of a small pig. I've got a photo of it. \nRONNIE I'd love to see that photo of that gout foot. \nGRAHAM A couple of bunions as well. \nRONNIE Fuck. \nGRAHAM I've got to go to the podiatrist, and I hope he can shoot me up with something. \nPETE Yeah, well, let's get you to the podiatrist. \nCAT Bye, Graham. \nRONNIE See you later, Graham. Good luck with your gout! \nGRAHAM Rock and Roll, baby. \nINT. PETE'S HOME OFFICE - AFTERNOON \nPete and Debbie are talking. Debbie holds a list of changes she wants to make. \nDEBBIE The happiest period in people's lives is from age forty to sixty. So this is it. We're in it, right now. \nPETE Says who? \nDEBBIE Says a lot of people, most people. \nPETE Huh. \nDEBBIE We have everything we need right now to be completely happy. We're going to blink and be ninety. \nPETE What? \nDEBBIE So, let's just choose to be happy. \nPETE Yeah. \nDEBBIE Your eyes are kind of glazing over. \nPETE No, I'm just processing it all. \nDEBBIE Some of these I wrote for you. So, we have to exercise every day. Spend more time alone together. We have to go to the therapist every week. \nPETE That's a little pricey. \nDEBBIE No stressing over tiny things. \nPETE Yeah, that's good. You should do that. \nDEBBIE We have to get more involved in school. Have more patience with the kids. And we need to work on our anger. \nPETE Yeah, I think it would be good if you could take care of your anger. \nDEBBIE No, I said both of us. \nPETE That's what I said. Our anger. \nDEBBIE Okay. No more smoking. \nPETE Yeah, you've got to cut that out. \nDEBBIE I don't want to make this about a fight, I want to just be positive. \nPETE Sorry. \nDEBBIE Okay, and then no more holding on to resentments. We have to just let that go. \n", "test1_id": 1572, "test2_input": "ACCOUNTANT We heard. \nDEBBIE You heard. \nACCOUNTANT And they're bad. You know, it's that, and it's the money that he's been lending to his father, that's creating a strain. \nDEBBIE How much have we lent him? \nACCOUNTANT Eighty thousand. \nDEBBIE Did you say \"eight thousand\" or \"eighty thousand\"? \nACCOUNTANT Eighty thousand, over the past couple of years. And then you missed the mortgage payment-- \nDEBBIE On the house? \nACCOUNTANT And you missed the rental on the office. \nDEBBIE Does Pete know that? \nACCOUNTANT Oh, yeah. We're on the phone all the time. Look, I know you're going through a hard time, and I want you guys to know that we're here for you, okay? Anything you guys need, that's why we're here. We're here for times like this. \nDEBBIE What are you going to do? \nACCOUNTANT There's not much I can do. \nINT. RECORD LABEL - MORNING \nPete enters and walks into Ronnie's office. Ronnie is drawing on a blackboard behind his desk. \nPETE What are you doing? \nRONNIE I'm drawing the album cover for Van Halen's Diver Down. \nPETE If you spent a little bit more time focusing on Graham Parker instead of drawing album covers, I wouldn't be in this predicament. \nRONNIE I'm focused on Graham Parker. \nPETE You're supposed to help me with him! (MORE) \nPETE (CONT'D) You're supposed to call the companies, you're supposed to get people to the show! \nRONNIE I've done everything I can, Pete. You had me pushing around a corpse. It was like being in fucking Weekend at Graham's. \nPETE What should we do? I'm out of ideas. \nRONNIE You fly in The Rumour. I can't sell a reunion concert without the band. It's ridiculous. \nPETE With what? I can't afford it. \nRONNIE You put this on yourself. You wanted the responsibility, take it on the chin, and stop acting like a bitch. \nPETE What did you call me? \nRONNIE Chin. \nPete walks out of Ronnie's office and into the main office space. Ronnie follows. \nRONNIE (CONT'D) Pete -- wait. I have an apartment, I have health insurance, I have car payments. I have responsibilities. \nPETE Don't talk to me about responsibilities. I have a life. I have a family. I can't afford to sit in my apartment getting high, jerking off, and then going to Tommy's Chili Burgers at three in the morning. \nRONNIE That's not even the order that happens in! \nPETE I have everything to lose here. Everything. \nRONNIE Yes. Because you spent thousands of dollars on shit we don't need. You really need to spend thirty thousand dollars on a fucking neon sign, dude? Which is inside? It's not even outside. We know where we work. \nPETE If you want to sign a band, you have to look like you're the real deal. \nRONNIE (to Cat) Princess Labia, how much is it to fly The Rumour in? \nCAT It's twelve thousand. \nRONNIE Twelve thousand dollars! \nPETE You know what? Fine. Fly in The Rumour. Put it on my AmEx. \nINT. GYNECOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nDebbie sits in Dr. Pelligrino's office. \nDEBBIE No, you said it was impossible. \nDR. PELLIGRINO I don't think I said it was impossible. \nDEBBIE Yeah. \nDR. PELLIGRINO I usually don't say impossible. I like to leave some wiggle room. \nDEBBIE You said that my fibroid was like a giant boulder, like the one from the Indiana Jones movies blocking up my uterus. \nDR. PELLIGRINO And I need to stop using that reference of Indiana Jones. I think that's not appropriate when talking about the reproductive system. \nDEBBIE It's okay. \nDR. PELLIGRINO Anyway, somehow the Eastern medicine has worked and the fibroid has dissipated. \nDEBBIE That's great. \nDR. PELLIGRINO Yes. Your fibroid shrunk, and somehow it allowed you to get pregnant. \nDEBBIE What? \nDR. PELLIGRINO You're going to have your third baby. Congratulations. \n", "test2_true": "DR. PELLIGRINO Yes. \nDebbie does not react. \nDR. PELLIGRINO (CONT'D) Would you like some water? \nDEBBIE That's good news. Another baby, at forty. \nDR. PELLIGRINO Debbie? \nDEBBIE I am thrilled. And Pete is going to be so happy. \nDR. PELLIGRINO So, you're okay? \nDEBBIE What a relief. I can finally relax now, you know? I'm so happy, I really am. It's good. \nDR. PELLIGRINO Great. Great. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nDebbie drives. We cannot tell what she is feeling. Then after a few beats, a joyous smile appears across her face. \nINT. RECORD LABEL - PETE'S OFFICE - DAY \nPete takes a framed item off of his wall. \nEXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - DAY \nLarry answers the door. Pete is there with a framed drawing made by John Lennon. \nPETE Hey, why are you in a bathrobe? It's the middle of the afternoon. \nINT. LARRY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nLARRY I took a late shower. Why are you busting my balls? Look, I'm sorry about the record. You're going through financial shit. This is what I live with. This is a horrible time in human history. What is that? \nPETE Something that might help both of our situations. \nPete hands him the drawing. \nPETE (CONT'D) This is a drawing by John Lennon. I got it ten years ago for five thousand dollars. I don't know how much it's worth now. Could be five, could be twenty. \nLARRY I don't want this. I don't even like it. I'm not going to hang it up. \nPETE It's not for you to hang up. It's for you to sell. That way I can give it to you and you can make some money, and Debbie doesn't know that I'm giving you anything. \nLARRY Well, you're not giving me money. You're giving me a project. I don't know how to sell this. I'm not an art dealer. \nPETE Just sell it online. Do some research, make some calls. Or is that too hard to do with your high blood pressure? \nLARRY All right. Don't get snippy. Just because you write a great song doesn't mean you can draw. \nPETE It's incredible. John Lennon drew it. \nLARRY I think it's a Ringo. Don't beat me up if I get three hundred dollars for it. \nPETE Don't take less than sixty-five hundred for that. It's very valuable. It's important to me. I want you to sell it so I can help you. \nLARRY Okay. \nPETE I'll see you at my party. \nLARRY What should I bring? You want wine or something? \nPETE No. Don't buy wine with my money and give it to me at my party. \nLARRY That's mean. \nPETE I love you. Bye. \nLARRY All right. Bye... How do I call eBay? \nINT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY \nSadie and a bunch of other kids are building sets for a school play. Sadie talks with a FRIEND. \nPete and Debbie are watching from afar, sitting next to each other. Debbie tries to gently break the news. \nDEBBIE She's so cute. She's so tall. \nPETE I know. How did that happen? \nDEBBIE Do you ever wish we had a bigger family? \nPETE No, never for a second. Never. \nDEBBIE Never? \nPETE Never. I love what we have. One? A breeze. Two? Brutal. Three? Put a bullet in my head. \nDebbie is totally deflated. \nPETE (CONT'D) I think about that gray-haired pregnant lady from school and I just feel bad for her. And I feel bad for the kid. Can you imagine? All the other little kids, \"Where's your mommy?\" \"Oh, she's the one sitting in that scooter eating a soft cracker.\" Kids don't want to have old parents. You know, it would also be nice for us to spend some time apart. Kind of rediscover who we are individually. It would be so great to not see you for like a chunk of time so that I could really just miss you. Remember when we used to miss each other? \nEXT. SCHOOL - DAY \nDebbie is walking through the campus upset. She sees a kid and darts over to him. \nDEBBIE Hey! \nJOSEPH (13), the kid who insulted Sadie on her Facebook, turns and sees Debbie. \nJOSEPH Yo, sup? \nDEBBIE I'm Sadie's mom. \n", "test2_id": 1573, "test3_input": "JODI Meow. \nDEBBIE Jodi.

Why don't you help me? \nDEBBIE Are you high right now? \nJODI (weirder) Help me. \nDebbie's phone buzzes. \nJODI (CONT'D) Is that about me? Is that the cops? Is this a set-up? \nDEBBIE I need to go. \nJODI Okay, see you later. (creepily) Fuck you, Debbie. Fuck. You. \nINT. VICE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY \nPete and Debbie are sitting across from VICE PRINCIPAL LAVIANI. In another seat is Joseph's mother, Catherine. \nMS. LAVIANI Joseph was very upset when I spoke to him about this, so I thought it was important that we join together and work this through. \nPETE Absolutely. \nCATHERINE We're going to work through it, but Debbie told my son that he looked like Tom Petty, in a negative way-- \nPETE Who's Tom Petty? \nCATHERINE You know who Tom Petty is. And she said that if she had to come back, that she was going to \"F up his pussy ass.\" Which is what she said. \nDEBBIE Are you serious? I didn't. I would never. To a child? Your son has been defiling my daughter's Facebook page now for months. \nCATHERINE These people are liars. He said that my son was an animal and that if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car. \nMS. LAVIANI Did you say that? \nPETE That's ridiculous. Who talks like that? \nCATHERINE You do. \nDebbie tries to hide a smile. \nDEBBIE He didn't say that. \nCATHERINE He said it. To me. \nPETE What I said was that we need to keep an extra eye on our kids because with all the technological advances, they need to learn to use them responsibly. \nCATHERINE No. He called me an \"iCunt.\" \nPETE A what? \nMS. LAVIANI Language, Catherine! \nCATHERINE How am I going to relay what these two nutballs said to me unless I say it. \nMS. LAVIANI Can you please not talk like that, Catherine? Music Man is rehearsing next door. \nCATHERINE Sorry, fucking Music Man. Maybe if I looked more like this fake bullshit couple, looks like they're in a bank commercial. That's what you look like. Like a bullshit bank commercial couple. \nMS. LAVIANI None of this talk is productive. \nCATHERINE I'd like to rear up and jackknife my legs and kick you both in the jaw with my foot bone. \nDEBBIE You're just really scaring me. \nCATHERINE This is what happens when you corner a rat. You corner me, I will chew through you. \nMS. LAVIANI Catherine, you're better than this. \nCATHERINE Fuck you, Jill. You're a horrible woman. This is why everybody hates you. This kind of shit. Ineffective. Bullshit hair. And I'm glad your husband died. Because you're a fucking asshole. He probably killed himself. \nMS. LAVIANI Okay, Catherine. I think we know what's happening now. \nDEBBIE Now you know what we're dealing with. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - DAY \nPete and Debbie leave the school together, surpressing smiles. They get in separate cars and drive off. \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nDebbie is making dinner. Pete and Charlotte sit at the table. \nCHARLOTTE I'm not going to eat that chicken. \nDEBBIE Why not? \nCHARLOTTE Because I feel like I'm going to be a vegetarian. \nDEBBIE Can you become a vegetarian tomorrow? \nCHARLOTTE No. \nSadie storms in. \nSADIE You guys have been reading my texts? \nPETE No, we haven't. \nDEBBIE Yes, we have. We're supposed to keep an eye on you. \nPETE How did you find out? \n", "test3_true": "PETE Don't be disrespectful. \nSADIE You're the ones who are disrespectful. Reading my texts is like reading my diary. \nDEBBIE You were really sweet on your iChat. We were really proud of you. \nPETE Yeah, we were going to give you your computer and phone back. \nSADIE Fuck you! \nPETE Okay, there's the first official \"Fuck you.\" \nDEBBIE That is not how we talk to each other in this house. \nSADIE You guys talk to each other like that all the time! And to Joseph and his mom. You made Joseph cry. \nCHARLOTTE Joseph has a crush on you. You like a boy who cries. \nSADIE Shut up, Charlotte. You guys so desperately want me to be perfect and to make no mistakes. Well, you two are fucking insane. \nDEBBIE Okay. \nSADIE All you do is fight. Or you don't fight, which is even worse because it looks like you hate each other for weeks. You obsess over every little thing I do, and you don't trust in me or believe in me. Well, I'm fucking sick of it! Yeah, I said \"fuck.\" Fuck fuck fuck. Ground me forever I don't care. I don't care about anything. (crying hard) I hate everything, everyone's going crazy, I don't care if I have no friends. \nDEBBIE Are you still upset about Lost? \nSADIE Of course I'm upset about Lost! You guys took away my shit before I could watch the last two episodes! I don't know what the fuck happens! \nShe walks off. \nDEBBIE She's becoming just like us. \nCHARLOTTE I hope I never get my period if this is what happens. \nINT. SADIE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSadie does her homework on her bed. Charlotte brings in Sadie's electronics and puts them down in a pile beside her. \nSADIE Where did you find these? \nCHARLOTTE I stole them. \nCharlotte walks away and starts to slide the door closed behind her. \nSADIE Thank you. \nCHARLOTTE No big deal. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nDebbie is sitting on the couch. Pete paces around the room. \nPETE Our kids are crazy. And it's our fault. \nDEBBIE Do you think there's anything we can do to turn it around? \nPETE Sadie's thirteen. She might be a lost cause. \nDEBBIE Where did she learn that kind of language? We don't talk like that. \nPETE I have no fucking idea... Do you think Sadie is this crazy because of us? Or is it hormones and Lost. \nDEBBIE J.J. Abrams. He's ruining our daughter. That fucking geek. \nPETE I feel bad for us. \nDEBBIE All of a sudden we're like a magnet for negativity. Why do people keep attacking us? What did we do? We're just doing our best. \nPETE Should we talk about our fight? \nDEBBIE I think we're under enough pressure. Let's just let it go this time. \nPETE Yeah. \nDEBBIE We can give each other a break. \nPETE Great. Thank you. And I'm sorry about my dad. You're right. I'm sorry that he's just an endless mooch. (beat) The truth is, this isn't about us. It's about our parents. \nDEBBIE We're not even mad at each other. We're mad at them. \nPETE Exactly. \nDEBBIE Let's just take away our parents' power by loving them. \nPETE Can we do that? \nDEBBIE Yes. \nPETE Thank god. \nDEBBIE I kind of feel better already, do you? \nPETE I do. \nDEBBIE I love you. \nPETE I love you too. \nDEBBIE It's not us, it's them. \nPETE Totally. \nThey hug. \nINT.

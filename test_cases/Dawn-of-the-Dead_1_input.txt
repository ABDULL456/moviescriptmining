Peter:	I'M HOPIN' THEY'LL JUST GO AWAY AFTER THEY FIND THEY CAN'T GET IN... 
546	The creatures moving slowly down the concourse are now getting close to the action. 
547	The men hop back into the car, it roars off with Roger still at the wheel. 
548	Again the sleek auto rips through the ranks of the advancing Zombies. They fall and scatter. 
549	The car speeds down the concourse, turns the corner near where Fran watches at the Department Store game. We hear Steve's voice on the woman's walkie talkie. 
Steve:	WE'RE OK...WE GOT IT MADE...IT'GONNA WORK. 
Fran stares out through the roll cage. The Zombies are staggering weakly after the car. 
550	With another tailspin, the auto pulls up at the second set of doors. The men scramble out of the back seat, the Zombies outside try to crawl under the second trailer. The men shut them out easily, locking the door and planting alarms. They stand to look down the concourse. 
551	The creatures seem even more spread out now. 
Steve:	HOW MANY YOU FIGURE ARE ALREADY IN... 
Peter:	DUNNO. NOT TOO MANY. WE'LL GET 'EM EASY. WE GET IT ALL LOCKED OFF AND WE'RE GOIN' ON A HUNT! 
The big Trooper raises his super-gun and sights through the telescope. 
552	As we see through the scope, cross hairs settle on the forehead of one of the creatures which is lumbering down the hall. The face is magnified, distorted by the telescope. The gun roars and the head in the scope explodes with red. 
553	The creature falls against a column, hit squarely through the brain. We sense the supreme accuracy of the magnificent weapon. 
554	It is night. The Zombies in the parking lot still group around the semis. They set up an eerie moaning in the moonlight. A slow piece of music starts to build. 
555	The creatures crawl under the trucks but cannot enter the mall. They pound and scratch at the doors, to no avail. 
556	From inside the concourse, the mob is muffled. Even the revolving door is locked now. It seems the most vulnerable, but the crawling creatures cannot quite get leverage to smash the glass panels and they have no tools to pound with. 
The auto is flush against the revolving doors inside, offering added protection. Several alarm units sit atop the car. They are the early warning devices against penetration. 
557	They camera starts to dolly back, the music builds. We see slain corpses of many Zombies lying askew in various parts of the building. It is like a battlefield after a war. 
558	The humans appear on the second storey balcony. Moving to the railing, looking down to the expanse of the building. They are guerrilla fighters, with their weapons strapped on. They have taken the Temple. The music hits a crescendo as the people look over their spoils. Even the wounded Roger seems triumphant as he limps to the rails, supporting himself on his arms. 
559	We see a spectacular shot of the full expanse of the building. Zombies lie dead everywhere. The humans have captures the gold of the Gods...In this case the Gods of Consumer Heaven. 
560	Peter's hand is on the maps of the Maintenance Corridor. He is drawing a line past the washrooms at the end of the hall near the firestair. 
Peter:	WE PUT UP THE WALL HERE. THERE'S NO DOOR FROM THE LAST OFFICE INTO THE WASHROOMS, SO NOBODY'LL GET NOSEY...AND THIS WAY WE CAN STILL GET TO THE PLUMBING... 
Steve:	WHY CAN'T WE JUST BOARD UP THE STAIRWAY. HELL, THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH A STACK OF CARTONS. 
Peter:	I'M NOT JUST WORRYIN' ABOUT THEM. SOONER OR LATER MIGHT BE A PATROL THROUGH HERE...LOOTERS MAYBE...I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO EVEN KNOW THAT STAIRWAY EXISTS. 
They look back at the map. 
Peter:	THE DUCTWORK RUNS ALL THE WAY INTO THE WASHROOMS. WE'LL HAVE TO GET IN AND OUT THAT WAY. WE'LL BRING UP ANY BUG STUFF WE WANT BEFORE WE PUT UP THE WALL. 
561	The men sit huddled. The large storage area is filled with mounds of supplies brought up from the mall stores, but the stuff all sits around in disarray. 
562	Behind the wall of cartons, Roger seems to be sleeping, but he is sweating feverishly, and his face twitches. Fran has been trying to soothe him with a wet cloth on his forehead. Now she stops, leaving the cloth on the shivering head. She moves out to Stephen and Peter. 
563	Fran:	HE SEEMS TO BE SLEEPING. 
Peter:	GOOD. 
564	The woman moves to where she has medical supplies on one of the cartons. There are bottles, vials and diabetic hypo syringes as well as bandages and dressings from the Pharmacy in the mall. 
Fran:	I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO... 
Steve:	YOU'RE DOIN' FINE. 
Fran:	HIS LEG IS AWFUL...THE INFECTION IS SPREADING FAST. CAN'T WE FLY HIM OUT OF HERE...TRY TO FIND A MED. UNIT... 
565	Steve looks at Peter. The big trooper speaks softly. 
Peter:	I'VE SEEN HALF A DOZEN GUYS GET BITTEN BY THOSE THINGS...NONE OF 'EM LASTED MORE THAN THIRTY SIX HOURS. 
566	Fran is stunned. Suddenly, Roger screams from behind the cartons. 
Roger:	PETER...PETER...WHERE ARE YOU? 
567	Peter:	RIGHT HERE, BUDDY. 
568	Roger is sitting up. His eyes look very dark and sunken. He is sweating even more profusely than before. 
Roger:	YEAH...YEAH...

Truman replaces the receiver, disappointed. 
INT.  LOCAL ITALIAN DELI.  LUNCHTIME. 
TRUMAN stands in line with a crush of other WHITE COLLAR WORKERS.  As he reaches the counter, the store owner, TYRONE, has anticipated his order and ahs already begun preparing a meatball and mozzarella sandwich on Italian roll.  Truman gazes at the sandwich skillfully under construction, pained by his own predictability. 
TYRONE (nauseatngly cheerful) How's it goin', Truman? 
TRUMAN (deadpan) Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery. 
TYRONE (not listening to Truman's reply, as Truman anticipated) Good.  Good. 
TRUMAN Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today? 
TYRONE (not missing a beat) I'd ask for identification. 
Truman forces a half-smile. 
We focus on another MALE OFFICE WORKER in line at the cash register, watching Truman out of the corner of his eye.  About to depart with his sandwich, the man receives a guarded rebuke from the FEMALE CASHIER. 
FEMALE CASHIER (a whisper to prevent Truman overhearing) He's right there.  You're supposed to pay when he's here. 
MALE CUSTOMER (nonchalant shrug as he departs) He never notices. 
We re-focus our attention on Truman who is taking the wrapped sandwich from Tyrone. 
TYRONE Hold on, Truman.  I got somethin' to show ya. 
Tyrone holds up a front page of the New York Post that features a photograph of a scaled-down replica of Columbus' Santa Maria, moored in front of the Manhattan skyline.  Truman's eyes widen at the photograph. 
TYRONE (referring to the photo) The flagship of Christoforo...our Genoese navigator, huh?  I know you love this like me. 
TRUMAN (averting his eyes with difficulty) Not me.  You got the wrong man. 
Tyrone tries not to let his disappointment show as Truman pays the Cashier and exits. 
TYRONE See ya tomorrow, Truman. 
EXT.  CITY PARK.  DAY. 
TRUMAN eats lunch alone on a concrete bench in a cement park. From his briefcase he pulls out an old hardcovered book, "To The Ends Of The Earth - The Age Of Exploration". 
A TRANSIENT in a wheelchair approaches, looking for a handout. Truman gives the homeless man half of his sandwich, reconsiders and gives him it all, his appetite gone.  As the transient wheels himself away, Truman loses himself in his book. 
INT.  A DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY. 
Close up on an old man's face.  CHRISTOF.  Hair pure white, late-sixties, a vitality in his eyes that belies his years. 
He stands beside a floor-to-ceiling window in a dimly-lit room. Outside the window, a single palm tree swaying against a deep blue Californian sky.  A news anchor-style earpiece disappears down the neck of the unconventionally-cut suit he wears. 
Suspended from the ceiling above his head is a television monitor upon which a surveillance picture of Truman, engrossed in his book, silently plays. 
CHLOE, twenty-something, androgenous-looking, similarly-suited, joins Christof at the window. 
CHRISTOF (never taking his eyes from the monitor) You ever pass a car wreck on the side of the road?  They're pulling out a body.  You know you shouldn't look, but you do. 
INT.  A CONFERENCE ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY. 
A group of a dozen MEN and WOMEN of varying ages sit around a circular conference table in a sterile, windowless meeting room.  All stare at a single telephone placed in the center of the table, anticipating a call.  On cue, the phone rings and one of the men, after waiting for the second ring, picks up. 
MAN Hello?...I'm sorry, I got more than enough insurance. 
He hangs up.  After a moment the phone rings again. 
INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY. 
TRUMAN sits at his desk, making a cold call. 
TRUMAN (into receiver) ...this isn't about insurance, this is about the great variable - when will death occur?  Could be a week, a month, a year.  Could happen today...A sunbather, minding his own business, gets stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella...No way you can guard against that kinda thing, no way at all... 
The prospect on the other end, unimpressed with his pitch, hangs up.  Truman's supervisor, LAWRENCE, younger than Truman by several years, sharper suit, sharper haircut, appears around the corner of the cubicle. 
LAWRENCE (handing Truman some documentation) Hey, Burbank, I got a bridge-buyer in Stapleton I need you to cloes by four. 
Truman turns pale.

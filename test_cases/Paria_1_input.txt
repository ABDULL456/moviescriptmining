ALIKE Shut up! 
LAURA Trying to help your ass. I'm sayin', whatchu waitin' for?! 
Alike shrugs it off, her smile fading a little. Laura elbows her and sneers. 
LAURA Kickin' that same `ol quiet shit since 6th grade. I don't need to press, I gets plenty. Shit. 
ALIKE Wah-wah. 
LAURA I get more pussy than your daddy, nigga, what?! 
ALIKE Oh shit!! Yeah, you got me with that one. 
7   INT. BUS - NIGHT                                              7 
Alike becomes more quiet and less playful as the ride wears on. A middle-class Bronx landscape, well-lit with a newly constructed Starbucks and renovated condos flits by the window. Alike reaches over and presses the tape. Laura elbows Alike. 
LAURA Quit playing. 
ALIKE Your stop. 
LAURA Huh? 
ALIKE Your stop-- you're getting off here, right? 
LAURA Nah, I'll roll with you a few more stops. 
ALIKE Why you gon' walk all the way back down for? That's stupid. 
LAURA Make sure you get home okay. 
The bus pulls to the curb. The light flicks on over the back door. 
ALIKE You ain't big, nigga. Trying to protect somebody. Hurry up, man, get off! 
LAURA (to bus driver) That's alright man--next stop. Next stop! 
Alike elbows Laura sharply. The bus driver frowns in the rear view. 
LAURA You ain't gotta push me, why're you beastin'? 
ALIKE I'm not beastin'. 
Laura climbs over Alike and swings toward the door. 
LAURA You got a problem. Call me. 
ALIKE I'ma call you. 
Alike turns and watches Laura stroll away. Laura drums a little beat on Alike's window as the bus pulls off. Alike waves and faces forward again. An OLD LADY sitting nearby shoots her a disapproving look. Alike rolls her eyes and moves to a seat farther away. 
8   INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS                                         8 
Alike studies her reflection in the window, and takes a breath. She unbuttons her bulky men's shirt to reveal a fitting baby doll shirt that reads "Princess." She stuffs her baseball cap and durag into her backpack and jabs a pair of small gold hoop earrings into her ears. She slumps back against the seat and stares into the night. 
The bus stops at a lonely island of curb. Alike is a dark silhouette sprinting around the corner and into the night. 
9   INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                9 
Alike cracks open the front door just wide enough to slip through. The house is dark except for the flashing microwave clock. 
Alike takes off her sneakers and pads down the hallway. Her younger sister, SHARONDA's door cracks open as she passes. 
SHARONDA You late. 
ALIKE (whispering) Be quiet. 
SHARONDA Where you been this late? 
ALIKE (whispering) Movies. 
SHARONDA Movie ended at midnight.

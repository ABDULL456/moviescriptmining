RORSCHACH No. No, no, no 
DET. FINE (O.S.) 
IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THERE WITH YOU, SEND 
THEM OUT UNHARMED. Moloch's corpse stares at Rorschach. Rorschach TEARS OPEN the cupboards, pulling items off the shelves. 
RORSCHACH Framed. Set up. Walked right into it. Stupid, stupid, stupid. 
DET. FINE (O.S.) 
LET'S MAKE THIS A NICE, CLEAN SURRENDER. 
RORSCHACH Heh. Never. Never surrender. Rorschach takes an AEROSOL CAN and a PEPPER SHAKER. 
DET. FINE (O.S.) 
ALRIGHT. I HOPE YOU'RE READY, "HERO." Rorschach's mask DISAPPEARS back into darkness. 
RORSCHACH When you are 
INT. MOLOCH'S BROWNSTONE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS 
CRASH! Moloch's door is SMASHED OPEN. Armed SWAT COPS swarm in, but no more than three can fit in the narrow entry way. 
SWAT COP 1 It's a bum tip, I'm telling you. 
SWAT COP 2- Keep your eyes open. SWAT Cop 1 moves down the hall, carelessly ahead of formation- --BEHIND HIM, Rorschach APPEARS out of the darkness. He IGNITES the AEROSOL CAN'S STREAM, SPRAYING THE COPS WITH FIRE. They fall back, screaming, shooting. SWAT Cop 1 catches the worst of it--he DROPS AND ROLLS on the floor, trying to extinguish the flames on him. Rorschach BOLTS upstairs, IGNITING the staircase behind him. Pandemonium. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SWAT COP 3 Where'd he go? 
SWAT COP 2 Upstairs! He's upstairs! Go! 
INT. MOLOCH'S BROWNSTONE - SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS 
SWAT COPS top the 2nd floor landing, already lit by fire. 
SWAT COP 3 Where is he?! (into radio) Send the second team in! Graves is down! And we need a fire unit. All this smoke-- 
SWAT COP 2 Stay calm, the file says he never goes armed. Rorschach APPEARS, blowing PEPPER INTO COP 2'S EYES. 
SWAT COP 2 (CONT'D) 
AHH! I CAN'T SEE! 
SWAT COP 3 Get out of the way! I don't have room to-- SWAT Cop 3 CLEARS his line of fire and finds Rorschach 
AIMING THE GRAPPLING GUN AT HIS CHEST . 
SWAT COP 3 (CONT'D) 
SHIT The HOOK BLOWS THE BODY-ARMORED COP OVER THE RAILING. 
EXT. MOLOCH'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 
Det. Gallagher and Fine watch from behind a LINE OF COP CARS. The house is now BLAZING. Smoke and men's screams drift out. 
DET. FINE We've got him. There's no way out. From the second floor, Rorschach SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW, snarling like a rabid dog, landing hard on the concrete. His ankle TWISTS, dropping him to the ground. Rorschach struggles to get to his feet. When he looks up he finds TWENTY COPS IN A SEMI-CIRCLE before him. A loaded, pregnant pause. The COPS RUSH FORWARD. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: But Rorschach holds up a gloved hand. And they all stop, unsure what this lunatic will do next. 
RORSCHACH Ten years. I've waited for this. He beckons them forward. The cops PILE INTO HIM. Rorschach brutally disables six cops before he is overwhelmed. 
RORSCHACH (CONT'D) No pain. Must get up. Find who framed me-- A Cop KICKS HIM in the throat. Rorschach drops again. 
FINE Get that mask off him! 
COP 1 I got it. Christ, he stinks! 
RORSCHACH No no no NO NO NO! The Cop peels back the shifting mask to reveal the Homeless Man from the news stand. He screams at them wildly.

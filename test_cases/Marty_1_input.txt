DR. KEEGAN No, I'm not kidding. 
MARTY You can't just walk off onna girl like that. 
Dr. Keegan shrugs, moves down the line of stag guys. Marty turns to watch him, still a little shocked at the proposition. The Doctor approaches THREE STAGS and obviously broaches the subject with one of them. This STAG seems more receptive to the idea. Dr. Keegan takes out a wallet and gives the Stag a five dollar bill. The Stag detaches himself from the wall and, a little ill-at-ease, follows the Doctor. 
Marty stands against the wall, watching the Doctor and the Stag, who come in and move past him. Concerned and curious, Marty stares after them, then moves out of his leaning position, following in their general direction. 
Marty moves through the crush of young men and women in the area around the dance floor. 
ALCOVE NEAR ARCHWAY. 
As Marty reaches the alcove that separates the dance floor proper from the lounge, he pauses and looks off toward the booths. 
LOUNGE. 
Clara sits about halfway down the length of the booths. Dr. Keegan and the Stag stand over her, talking to her. She is looking up at them, her hands nervously gripping a Coca Cola glass. Dr. Keegan is obviously introducing the Stag to Clara and is going through some story about being called away on an emergency. The Stag is presented as her escort-to-be, who will see to it that she gets home safely. 
Clara is not taken in by any of this, although she is trying hard not to seem affected. She politely rejects the Stag's company and will go home by herself, thanks for asking anyway. Dr. Keegan makes a few mild protestations, and then he and the Stag leave the booth and start back toward the archway. 
ARCHWAY. 
From where Marty stands, he can watch Clara, as well as Dr. Keegan and the Stag. The Doctor and the Stag start past Marty, and he catches their conversation. 
DR. KEEGAN ...in that case, as long as she's going home alone, give me the five bucks back... 
STAG Look, Mac, you paid me the five bucks. I was willing. It's my five bucks... 
They move past and away and Marty stares after them before he turns his attention toward Clara off-screen. 
Clara is sitting as she was, gripping and ungripping the glass of Coca Cola in front of her. Her eyes are closed. Then, with a little nervous shake of her head she gets out of the booth and stands momentarily at a loss for what next to do. As she glances around, CAMERA ANGLES to include a sign over an exit that reads "Fire Escape." Clara starts moving toward that door. 
Marty is staring off-screen toward Clara. He slowly works his way down the length of the lounge in the general direction of the fire escape. 
LOUNGE. 
Near the entrance to the fire escape, Clara comes into view. Background sounds continue steadily. 
Marty is walking the length of the lounge and suddenly stops and stares off-screen. 
Clara disappears through the exit onto the fire escape outside. 
Marty watches. Then he continues on, crossing the threshold of the... 
FIRE ESCAPE. 
It is sizeable, almost a small balcony. It looks out onto the backs of innumerable five-story apartment houses. Clara is standing by the railing, her back toward the camera, her head sunk down. She is crying. Marty watches her for a moment before moving a step or two forward. 
Clara doesn't turn. Marty tries to think of something to say. 
MARTY (finally) Excuse me, Miss, would you care to dance? 
Clara slowly turns to Marty, her face streaked with tears, her lips trembling. Then, in one of those moments of simultaneous impulse, she lurches to Marty with a sob, and Marty takes her to him.

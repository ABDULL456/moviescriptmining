Miguel brightens.     Frida turns back to the rehearsal. 
FRIDA The dancers exit, the music fades, the lights go out! And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage! 
A silhouette rises from a trap door.         Miguel leans forward. 
A spotlight shines on the silhouette revealing it to be a mannequin. 
MIGUEL Huh? 
FRIDA He does a couple of songs, the sun rises, everyone cheers-- 
Miguel hustles up to Frida. 
MIGUEL Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz? 
FRIDA Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals. He's too busy hosting that fancy party at the top of his tower. 
She gestures out a large window to a GRAND ESTATE lit up in the distance, atop a steep hill. 
Suddenly Héctor rounds the corner, out of breath. 
HÉCTOR Chamaco! You can't run off on me like that! C'mon, stop pestering the celebrities... 
Héctor pulls Miguel away, but Miguel won't be wrangled. 
MIGUEL You said my great-great grandpa would be here! He's halfway across town, throwing some big party. 
HÉCTOR That bum! Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal? 
MIGUEL If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you? 
HÉCTOR He's YOUR great-great grandpa.   How come he didn't invite YOU? 
Héctor walks away from Miguel toward the musicians. 
HÉCTOR Hey Gustavo! You know anything about this party? 
GUSTAVO It's the hot ticket. But if you're not on the guest list you're never getting in, Chorizo... 
MUSICIANS Hey, it's Chorizo! / Choricito! 
HÉCTOR Ha ha, very funny guys.      Very funny. 
MIGUEL Chorizo? 
GUSTAVO (to Miguel, re: Héctor) Oh, this guy's famous! Go on, go on, ask him how he died! 
Miguel looks to Héctor, eyebrow cocked. 
HÉCTOR I don't want to talk about it. 
GUSTAVO He choked on some CHORIZO! 
The musicians laugh.     Miguel tries to stifle a giggle. 
HÉCTOR I didn't choke, okay -- I got food poisoning, which is a big difference! 
More laughter. 
HÉCTOR (to Miguel) This is why I don't like musicians... bunch of self- important jerks! 
MIGUEL Hey, I'm a musician. 
HÉCTOR You are? 
GUSTAVO Well, if you really want to get to Ernesto, there IS that music competition at the Plaza de la Cruz. Winner gets to play at his party... 
Miguel's wheels start turning. 
HÉCTOR No, no, no, chamaco, you are loco if you think-- 
Miguel looks to his hands, progressed in their skeletal transformation. 
MIGUEL I need to get my great-great grandfather's blessing. 
Miguel looks up to Héctor. 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) You know where I can get a guitar? 
Héctor sighs. 
HÉCTOR I know a guy... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UNDERPASS TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Pepita sweeps across the sky, landing in a darkened corner. She casts a shadow on the wall, then lurches into the light. She sniffs out the spot where Héctor painted Miguel's face, finding a canister of shoe polish. She lets out a low growl. 
The Dead Riveras follow after her. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Have you found him, Pepita?      Have you found our boy? 
Pepita breathes on the ground, revealing a footprint.   It glows for a moment. The family leans in to inspect. 
TÍA ROSITA A footprint!

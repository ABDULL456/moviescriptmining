EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - DAY 
WITH STRICKLAND, finishing his cell call. 
STRICKLAND .maybe I'm not done with the O.D. Maybe you're not gonna get it back at all. Guy could have a lot of fun with your little toy... oh you can do better than that. I'll be in touch... He tosses the cellphone in a trashcan, pulls on his helmet, STARTS the bike and peels out. 
EXT. BALTIMORE - DAY 
AERIAL SHOT - CAMERA tracking over the CHESAPEAKE BAY and into the city, late afternoon. A small black CHOPPER with doorless openings on either side ENTERS FRAME. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
GREER is beside a PILOT, a handsome Hispanic surrie named LOPEZ. Greer shouts over the BLADE ROAR: 
GREER We're close! Noise suppression! LOPEZ nods, hits a couple of switches. THE LOUD THROB becomes a barely audible WHIRR. We hear PETERS' VOICE over the radio: 
PETERS (FILTER) Got a hit on the bike, half a mile from the rez, check your screen. ON THE CHOPPER DASH, A GPS DISPLAY of the nearby neighborhood, a BLINKING DOT a short distance away. 
PETERS (FILTER) (CONT'D) Baltimore PD's sending back-up. You can't fly over Dread territory, you know. We don't 
HAVE JURISDICTION-- Greer clicks off the radio, turns to Lopez. 
GREER Ignore her, Lopez. Get us as close as you can. LOPEZ grins--and pushes the stick hard-- 
EXT. BALTIMORE - DAY 
THE CHOPPER banks and swoops almost silently. 
TNT. FBI BUILDING/SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY BOBBY glances over at PETERS as she monitors a GPS SCREEN and various INSET VIDEO FEEDS. He continues to work as he flirts with her. 
BOBBY You really look like your surrie? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: PETERS throws him a glare, turns back to her work. 
BOBBY (CONT'D) Don't be so touchy. I'm engaged to B-47 down there. He points to one of the many identical female DRONES buzzing along the tracks. PETERS smiles. 
EXT. BALTIMORE SLUMS - DUSK 
STRICKLAND moves briskly on his BIKE. He glances in his MIRROR and sees-- --a couple of SQUAD CARS catching up with him. He hits the THROTTLE. ANOTHER COP CAR roars around the corner ahead of him, SQUAWKS the SIREN. STRICKLAND changes direction, veers into a narrow alley. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK 
LOPEZ and GREER are directly overhead, watching STRICKLAND maneuver his bike quickly into the alley. 
EXT. SLUM ALLEY - DUSK 
The alley is a DEAD END, a FENCE blocking the exit. STRICKLAND skids the bike into a CRASHING STOP, knocking over piles of GARBAGE. A SQUAD CAR barely clears the walls on either side, pursuing. It stops at a narrowing space, cops squeeze out either door, aiming GUNS. 
COP Freeze! STRICKLAND stumbles away from his bike, into an alcove. The cops approach, guns ready. STRICKLAND yanks off his helmet, pulls his ominous DEVICE from his pocket. Without poking his head out, he aims it in the cops direction. He PRESSES A BUTTON. A row of RED DIODES GLOW on the device as he sweeps it across the alley, but it emits no projectiles and makes no sound. COP #1 is closer-- his GLASS EYES SHATTER. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: COP #2 drops his weapon, staggers backward and falls, clutching his head. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK 
GREER has seen this, horrified. 
GREER Jesus, what is that? STRICKLAND is on the run again, scaling the fence. He hasn't spotted the chopper. GREER looks in the direction he's heading-- A HUGE CHAIN-LINK FENCE, topped with barbed wire, stretching across the whole city, just a hundred yards away. PORTRAITS of the PROPHET (the man we heard on the radio), long-haired and bearded, adorn the fence. There's a GATE, with two GUARDS checking those entering, one or two people are waiting. 
GREER (CONT'D) He gets through the gate, we can't touch him. GREER readies a RIFLE with a SCOPE, loads a TRANQUILIZER DART into the chamber. LOPEZ maneuvers to give Greer an angle out the chopper's side. 
EXT. SLUM ALLEY - DUSK 
STRICKLAND looks up to see GREER taking aim from the silent chopper. He leaps for cover behind a dumpster as-- GREER FIRES a DART, which RICOCHETS off the DUMPSTER. STRICKLAND scrambles around a corner. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK 
LOPEZ turns the bird forward to pursue, as GREER reloads. They round the corner. No sign of Strickland on the pavement. GREER looks to his left, beyond the PILOT-- STRICKLAND has scaled a fire escape, aiming the DEVICE right at Lopez. Greer sees what's about to happen--

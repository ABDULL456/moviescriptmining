JOKER (cont'd) Who locked this door? 
Everybody looks confused. 
JOKER (cont'd) Who locked this fuckin' door?! 
Joker starts to kick the door. 
INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Craig hurries to put the pump back.  He's about to go for the window when: BANG!  There's a KICK on the door.  All Craig can do is go for another door on the other side of the room. BANG!  The door flies open and Craig is out there just in time. 
JOKER I don't want no doors locked around here. You hear me? 
Joker walks in and hits the lights.  He throws the girl on the bed. 
GIRL #2 Oh, poppy, I like it rough. 
JOKER (taking off shirt) Good, 'cause that's how you gonna get it. 
INT. JOKER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Baby Joker has his back turned when we see Craig sprint behind him and up the stairs.  Baby Joker turns around.  He thinks he saw something.  He slowly starts to walk up the stairs. 
LI'L JOKER Karla! 
INT. KARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Karla is in her room working out.  Craig runs in.  He's shocked to see her.  She doesn't see him, but he's frozen. Then she turns around and he startles her. 
KARLA What are you doing? 
Think fast, Craig. 
CRAIG Huh? 
KARLA What are you doing here? 
CRAIG I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life. 
KARLA What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that? 
CRAIG Yes I did.  Excuse me. 
Her door flies open.  Smashing Craig behind it.  It's Li'l Joker. 
LI'L JOKER Who you talking to? 
Craig looks nervous. 
KARLA Nobody. 
LI'L JOKER I heard a voice. 
KARLA No you didn't.  Get out my room.  Go back down to your little girlfriends. 
Karla pushes Li'l Joker out. 
OUTSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS 
Day-Day is having a fit. 
GIRL #2 (O.S.) Shut the window. 
JOKER (O.S.) You shut the window. 
She does. 
DAY-DAY Oh shit.

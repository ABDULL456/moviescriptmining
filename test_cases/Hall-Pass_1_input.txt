RICK You don't even have a hall pass. 
HOG-HEAD So? I can still live vicariously through you guys, can't I? 
RICK It's not vicarious if you're actually doing it. 
HOG-HEAD Whatever. Just hit your ball. Hog-Head takes ANOTHER BITE. 
FRED Oh, what the hell, it's not like my game can get any worse. 
Rick watches Fred pick up a brownie and TENTATIVELY TASTE IT. Then Gary INHALES HIS IN ONE BITE. 
RICK All right, give me one of those things. As Rick drops his club and walks toward the brownies, we

75 MINUTES LATER 
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY 
A dazed and confused Rick and Fred are RECLINING in their cart in the middle of the fairway. For a while neither of them speak. Then: 
FRED What kind of soap do you use? 
RICK 
(BEAT) You mean in the shower? 
FRED Yeah. 
RICK Dove. 
FRED Yeah, I like Dove--it doesn't dry your skin so much. Fred stares into space. 
FRED (CONT'D) Sometimes it's hard to wash off, though. Because of the moisturizer. You ever notice--? 
RICK I think Hog-head's dead. Fred looks over and sees Hog-head SPRAWLED OUT ON HIS BACK IN A SAND TRAP. He's not moving. 
FRED 
(CALLING OUT) Hog-head...? Are you okay? As Hog-head starts to make SNOW ANGELS IN THE SAND, an elderly COURSE RANGER pulls up in a golf cart. 
RANGER What the hell is he doing? Rick and Fred grow visibly tense at the sight of an authority figure. 
RICK Uh, he's having back spasms. 
RANGER Not him. Him. Rick and Fred turn and see Gary STANDING CHEST-DEEP in the MIDDLE OF A POND just STARING AT THEM. 
RICK 
(CALLING OUT) Gary! What are you doing?! 
GARY I don't know--you tell me! Gary starts to LAUGH MANIACALLY. The Ranger turns to Rick, annoyed. 
RANGER Look, this is the third time I've had to flag your group and you're only on the fourth hole. Now if I have to come out here again, you're done for the day. 
RICK Gotcha. We'll pick it up, sir. The Ranger shoots them a look and DRIVES OFF toward the TWO ASIAN FOURSOMES waiting on the tee behind them.

27 MINUTES LATER 
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY 
The four guys are unnaturally bunched together on another fairway. 
RICK Think. Where did you last see it? 
GARY On the course. 
RICK Where on the course? 
GARY I don't know--on a fairway, I think. I clot out, grabbed my club, took a swing, and when I turned around it had disappeared. 
RICK You're serious? You're telling us you lost your golf cart? 
FRED 
(STONER VOICE) Dude, where's my golf cart? 
RICK Shut up, Fred. 
HOG-HEAD Guys, I gotta go poo again. 
GARY I didn't lose it, I think it was stolen.

BEN I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. 
Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then he fixes his gaze on Luke. 
BEN You'd better get on with your exercises. 
Han Solo enters the room. 
HAN Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. 
Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber. 
HAN Don't everyone thank me at once. 
Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move along a chess-type board. 
HAN Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. 
Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- covered arms over his head. 
THREEPIO Now be careful, Artoo. 
Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to argue with the huge Wookiee. 
THREEPIO He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. 
HAN (interrupting) Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. 
THREEPIO But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. 
HAN That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. 
THREEPIO I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win. 
Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements. Han watches with a bit of smugness. 
BEN Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. 
LUKE You mean it controls your actions? 
BEN Partially. But it also obeys your commands. 
Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter. 
HAN Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. 
LUKE You don't believe in the Force, do you? 
HAN Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. 
Ben smiles quietly. 
HAN It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. 
BEN I suggest you try it again, Luke. 
Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his eyes. 
BEN This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. 
LUKE (laughing) With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight? 
BEN Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. 
Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker. 
BEN Stretch out with your feelings. 
Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original position. 
BEN You see, you can do it. 
HAN I call it luck. 
BEN In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. 
HAN Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else. 
Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel. 
HAN Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan. 
Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit. 
LUKE You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. 
BEN That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world. 
INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM 
Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the evil Dark Lord Darth Vader. 
TARKIN Yes. 
OFFICER CASS Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. 
TARKIN She lied! She lied to us! 
VADER I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. 
TARKIN Terminate her... immediately! 
EXT. HYPERSPACE 
The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange surreal light show surrounds the ship. 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT 
HAN Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. 
Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering the sides of the ship. 
HAN What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts.

I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - NIGHT - LIVINGROOM Ruth enters. She's beat. She starts to put her purse down, when 
SHE NOTICES: Matt, kneeling in front of the reclining chair. It's back is to her. 
MATT Just hold still ... 
Ruth drops her purse and quickly comes around the recliner. Something stops her. 
RUTH Oh my God. Matt holds Frank's jaw. He gently turns his face toward the lamp. Frank has stitches over his right eye. The blood under the white of the pupil oozing. Both lips are bright and swollen. 
F 
DAD 
MATT Come on, Frank. Hold still. Ruth hovers, in shock. 
RUTH This was her husband, wasn't it? Frank nods wearily. 
F Ex, he dropped in. He takes the compress from Matt and gingerly applies it to his forehead. 
MATT Press charges. 
F No. 
RUTH What's to stop him from doing it again? 
MATT Did you hit him at all? Tell me you hit him! Enough so he won't want to next time? 
F I don't think I touched him. Matt pulls up the skin around the bloody eye. 
F ! Jesus, Dad! Ruth stares at the Hospital band around Frank's wrist. 
8 -`V 
MATT So what are you going to do? 
F 
(SMILING) Take Karate. 
RUTH That's not the problem. 
F You know you like her. 
RUTH I like a lot of people. What about the boys? Did they see it? 
F They were asleep. 
RUTH Did you leave her alone with him? 
FRANK He left first. She was yelling at ham. I believe she had a skillet in her hand. 
RUTH Oh for God's sake. 
(TO MATT) Did you call the police? Not yet. 
RUTH You didn't call them? 
MATT When was I going to call the police, Ruth? He just got in. Ruth scans the room. 
RUTH Where's the phone? 
F MOM! hold on a second, Calm down. Let's just talk about this. Ruth wavers. Now the cops'll go to her place first -- and it'll scare the hell out of the kids.

EXT.  NORBULINKA  DAY 
The young Tenzin Gyatso bursts through the gate in the Yellow Wall and runs across the beautiful garden to his parents's home. 
INT.  PARENTS'S HOME, NORBULINKA  DAY 
A family gathering meets the boy's eye when he enters. 
There is his Mother, his oldest sister, Tsering Dolma, Lobsang Samten, a younger sister, Pema, baby brother Tendzin Chuta, and his oldest brother, Takster. 
We don't recognize these faces, of course, but the gathering is obviously familial. 
Only the boy's Father is missing. 
Tenzin Gyatso goes to his Mother and lays his head in her lap. 
On an altar behind her, is a silver frame.  In the frame is a picture of her husband. 
DREAM SEQUENCE 
EXT.  HILLTOP  DAWN 
The body of the Dalai Lama's Father lays on a flat boulder. 
Incense smoke curls into the air.  Prayer wheels are turned, hand drums are played - the burial men stand off to one side, their hatchets and knives in view. 
Tenzin Gyatso is present.  He is the boy we know, but beside him stands the four year-old boy, Lhamo, from the beginning of the movie, and on the other side of him stands the boy who will play the Dalai Lama in the next section of the film -  a boy about fifteen or sixteen. 
Tenzin Gyatso wraps his brown rosary around his left wrist. The beads catch the brilliant afternoon light.  The sixteen year-old Dalai Lama wears the same colored rosary around his left wrist. 
The cutters move in to the corpse, and as we hear them begin the work of dismembering the body, the view pans up to reveal the vultures circling overhead. 
The last person leaving the hilltop with is the Dalai Lama as an older man - not a character from this movie - but a man of about fifty years, wearing glasses, wearing the same robes, the same rosary.  Little Lhamo walks beside him. 
END DREAM SEQUENCE 
EXT.  SKY OVER TIBET  NIGHT 
We hear a loud explosion, and then another and another and another.  The sound begins to fade, but the blue-black, peaceful, star-filled sky is shattered by bright bursts of red and yellow and pink light. 
It is a frightening sight. 
EXT.  GARDEN, NORBULINKA  DAWN (1950) 
The still waters of the fish pond begin to move.  The fish swim in nervous circles;  the water laps over its stone banks. 
EXT.  DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE  DAWN 
The whole building shakes.  Earthquake. 
One monk runs down the stairs, another monk runs up, both staring at a second floor window - a black-rimmed, glass window. 
A red cloth is pulled back and the window is opened. 
The fifteen year-old Tenzin Gyatso looks out. 
There is a terrible rumbling:  the rumbling that accompanies an earthquake.  Finally, slowly, the sound, and the movement subsides. 
CLOSE on Tenzin Gyatso.  He lets the curtain fall. 
INT.  GREAT HALL, THE POTALA  DAY 
The General Assembly is in session. 
Once again, the Yigstang and the Tsitang - four monks and four laymen - sit facing one another.  But the room is crowded today - this is a full session.  The Lord chamberlain sits in.  Regent Taktra is there. 
The senior Layman is on his knees. 
LAYMAN The Communist have control of China. 
In the back of the room we notice an open door. 
INT.  HALLWAY  DAY 
The Dalai Lama is listening.  He stands taller than the first time we caught him eavesdropping.  He still is not a part of this assembly, but he doesn't seem to care if he is spotted. 
INT.  GREAT HALL  DAY 
The Layman continues. 
LAYMAN Now, as his great army, stands idle on our borders, Chairman Mao has presented Tibet with three demands: 
One, Tibet must accept that it is part of China. 
A murmuring in the room.

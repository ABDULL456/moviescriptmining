INT. MILO'S OFFICE - DAY 
Milo's typing. 
LISA Milo? 
He looks. He stands. 
MILO Lisa. 
LISA You know my name. 
MILO You know mine. 
LISA You're famous around here. 
MILO (winces) I'm getting a teacher's pet rep. 
LISA I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets. 
MILO ...Were you? 
LISA We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers. 
MILO Me too! Were you an Army brat or something? 
LISA ...Something like that. Yeah. 
MILO Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something. 
This seems to jolt her. She pales a little. What a mysterious girl. But this only adds to her allure. 
MILO Did I say something? 
LISA No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work. 
This strikes a deep chord with Milo, all of it. 
MILO I used to wish that. All the time. 
They're looking at each other: he gets self-conscious. 
MILO (re: the CD-ROM) What've you got there? 
LISA Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you. 
MILO Show me. 
They sit. As she inserts the disk, he finds himself looking at her. On the screen, the frontier outpost we know as the logo appears. It's struck by a bolt from the sky. The outpost comes alive with light, music, movie-images through its windows, a ringing phone. Finally, the word SKYWIRE burns into it. It's neat, she's really good. 
MILO Cool! 
LISA Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to -- 
Simultaneously, they reach for the mouse. Their hands touch. They look at each other. Something happened. 
MILO ...Sh-Show me the next one. 
She nods, manipulates the mouse. He stares at the screen strenuously, fighting the impulse to stare at Lisa. 
INT. ANTEROOM - GARY'S OFFICE 
Gary's SECRETARY types as Milo enters. She smiles at him. 
SECRETARY Have a seat. He's with someone, but I know he wants to see you. 
INT. GARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Gary's face is red. The two Lawyers who sat in on his deposition are with him again. 
LAWYER Because we bundled it, the judge is threatening to enjoin the whole -- 
GARY I'm confused, Ted. 
Gary has used the phrase before, but the pretense of ingenuousness is gone; it's witheringly condescending. 
GARY Didn't you tell me they'd be Chapter 12 by the time they could hope to enjoin? I'm very confused, because you said they'd be ready to settle. 
ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Milo hears Gary yelling behind the closed door. It's indecipherable, but we discern an enraged "bullshit!" Milo flips through a copy of Wired, trying to ignore it. The Lawyers come out, passing swiftly, rather grimly. 
SECRETARY Go on in. (when Milo looks dubious) He's always happy to see you. 
INT. GARY'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER 
Agitated, Gary rather compulsively lines-up the papers, pens, etc. on his desk; he barely hears the knock at the open doorframe. 
GARY Milo. What's up? 
MILO Well -- you sent for me. 
GARY Right... Right.

GARCETTI You're paranoid, Flynne.  I think that crank is finally starting to get the best of you. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Danny waiting on the corner. 
GARCETTI (V.O.) When is the deal going down? 
DANNY (V.O.) I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week. 
Jimmy's Vega sputters to a stop in front of Danny.  Jimmy gets out and hands Danny the keys. 
ON THE BUMPTER, a hand-made sign. It reads: PULL ME OVER. I DARE YOU! 
Danny sighs. Walks to the back, rips the sign off and gets in the car, leaving Jimmy with the sign. JIMMY You sure you don't want me to go with you? 
Danny burns rubber. 
EXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - NIGHT 
Danny being led towards a trailer by TWO OF POOH-BEAR'S MEN. LITTLE BILL AND BIG BILL. Little Bill is big and Big Bill is little. 
INT. HOUSE - SAME 
Pooh-Bear sitting in a recliner, obscured by shadows when Danny and his escorts enter. 
A WIRE CAGE IN THE CORNER, SOMETHING MOVING AROUND INSIDE.  It too is obscured by shadows. 
Pooh-Bear doesn't look up. He is preoccupied with something in his hand which he is cleaning with a toothbrush. 
DANNY Pooh-Bear, my man.  What's up? 
Pooh-Bear doesn't respond. Continues brushing. 
LITTLE BILL He's blue. 
BIG BILL Comin' down from a 10 day ride. 
Danny closes his eyes. Not what he wanted to hear. 
DANNY You want to do this some other time? 
POOH-BEAR (gloomy and tired) Pull your pants down. 
DANNY I'm sorry? 
POOH-BEAR Pull your motherfucking pants down. 
Danny looks to the two Bills for help. 
DANNY (laughing nervously) Come on, guys ... 
POOH-BEAR Big Bill. 
Big Bill pulls a 19th century double-barreled FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his jacket and points it at Danny's head. 
BIG BILL Argh, matie. I'm a pirate. 
POOH-BEAR Little Bill 
Little Bill drops Danny's trousers.  Danny about to object when he is started into silence. 
The saturnine Pooh-Bear raises his head, illuminating his face.  He isn't wearing his prosthetic nose.  A GAPING HOLE WHERE HIS NOSE SHOULD BE.  He looks like some obscene human bat. 
Pooh-Bear holds up the plastic nose he has been cleaning, inspecting it under the light. 
POOH-BEAR (cont'd) Introduce him to Captain Steubing. 
He pops his nose back into place, but it goes on crooked. 
The Bills escort Danny over to the cage.  There is A GIGANTIC CRAZED WEASEL INSIDE. 
The cage is divided by a large piece of Plexiglas. 
POOH-BEAR (cont'd) You'll have to excuse him, he ain't ate for over a week. 
The weasel is foaming at the mouth. 
POOH-BEAR (cont'd) That and the rabies.  Don't make for a happy weasel. 
DANNY (trying to stay calm) Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this? (off Pooh-Bear's silence) It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal. 
POOH-BEAR Big Bill 
Big Bill pushes Danny up to the cage, which comes up to about waist level. 
POOH-BEAR Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police. 
DANNY What?! 
Pooh-Bear holds up his hand. 
POOH-BEAR Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation. 
DANNY Please .. I don't know what you're ... 
POOH-BEAR Uh-uh-uh ... 
He points to the cage.   Danny looks down at the weasel, which is trying to gnaw through the Plexiglas.

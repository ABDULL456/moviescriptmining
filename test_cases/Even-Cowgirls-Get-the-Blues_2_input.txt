She hears the screen door screech open and a chaos of footsteps in the hall. She goes to her window. And she can see, partially cut off by the corner of the building, Miss Adrian screaming. 
MISS ADRIAN You will all be rounded up and sent to prison if you take this any farther! This is not your ranch!!!! 
EXT. THE FRONT YARD OF THE RUBBER ROSE 
The Countess seems to be taking it slowly, and calmly smoking a French cigarette. He observes the fighting among them with amusement. 
THE COUNTESS You pathetic little cutesy-poos. Do you actually suppose this exhibition of childlike melodrama is advancing the cause of freedom? 
JELLY You owe us this here ranch, as a token payment for your disgusting exploitations 
THE COUNTESS (tranquilly) Then take it. 
JELLY Go for it, girls! 
The hands, who carry axes, picks, pitchforks and shovels, retreat. The Countess, still grinning, reaches for an hors d'oeuvre and subjects his cigarette to a measured, self- assured puff. 
MISS ADRIAN (shaking her fist) Go to your bunkhouse and remain there! 
INT. ROOMS 
The guests are hurriedly packing their things. 
INT. SISSY'S ROOM 
She looks on. 
EXT. FRONT YARD 
When the revolutionaries have retreated about thirty yards, they stop. With astonishing rapidity, they unbuckle unbutton and unzip and step out of their jeans and underpants. Then, nude from the waist down, thatched pubises thrust forward, up front and leading the way, they begin to advance. 
The Countess's grin goes down his throat like bathwater down a drain. 
GLORIA Better reach for your spray cans! 
JELLY Not one of these pussies has been washed in a week! 
Rather pale, his nose twitching, the Countess drops the caviar canap√© he has been holding. 
ON COME THE COWGIRLS, pelvises pumping, laying down what the trembling Countess believes to be a devastating barrage of musk. 
Miss Adrian, lost in her own hysteria, charges. A barbeque fork she hurls draws blood from Heather's eyebrow. 
Quick as a frog's tongue, Delores's whip cracks. It's lash curls around the ranch manager's ankles, pulling her feet from under her. She hits the sod in a jangle of jewelry and expulsion of breath. 
A Molotov cocktail thrown by Big Red says hello to the sexual reconditioning building. Within seconds, the structure is blazing.

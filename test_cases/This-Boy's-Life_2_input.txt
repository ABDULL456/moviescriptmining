THIS BOY'S LIFE FADE IN: 
1   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                          1 It is 1957, and we are in the deserts of Utah. TONY BENNETT sings "Rags to Riches" on the SOUNDTRACK. Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a highway. The CAMERA MOVES to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors up a hill. Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile- per-hour pace. Two cars decide to ignore safety and cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car. 
2   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - PARALLEL TIME                        2 Two people are in the straining car -- a woman and her son. The woman is CAROLINE WOLFF. Somewhere in her 30s, she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works at it. (Just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a fading bruise on her right cheekbone.) She is bright and energetic and lively. Even more important than these qualities, though, is her humor. And most important of all is a sensual quality she exudes. Her sensuality is effortless -- as natural to her as the color of her eyes and hair. Men turn on the street to stare at her. The boy is TOBY WOLFF. A    pleasant-faced boy with won- derful eyes, he is 13 --   teetering on the brink of adolescence, so that one   moment he seems like a self- assured teenager, and the   very next like a ten-year-old kid. Just now the ten-year-old kid has the upper hand: bored and weary with the long trip, Toby has been arguing with Caroline, who is ignoring him. TOBY ... Well,  I mean it. I'm serious -- I do.   You promise and promise, and then  you change your mind, just like  that. CAROLINE (totally oblivious) ... Uh-huh. TOBY You wait 'til you ask me for something. Just wait. See if you get it.

So concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish her sentence, she nurses the car upward. Finally the car crests the hill and starts down. Caroline sighs with relief. She turns to Toby with a smile. CAROLINE What'd you say? TOBY I said -- for the twentieth time -- if a person promises somebody something, they can't just turn around and take it back. CAROLINE Oh, honey, Jesus. Don't start with that again. TOBY Why not? CAROLINE Because I'm the mother, and I get to tell you what to do every minute of your life 'til you're eighteen. Seriously, we've got no money. I can't buy you the moccasins. TOBY I bet if you'd promised Roy some moccasins he'd of got 'em. 
CAROLINE No talk about Roy, okay? And ditto the moccasins. We, can't, afford, them. TOBY Yeah, but you did promise... CAROLINE Sue me. Take me to court. Oh, Toby, I know you're disappointed, but... TOBY Jack.   Call me Jack. (CONTINUED)

Garvey comes from around the building's corner and peers furtively through the darkness toward the lighted windows of Rocklin's room. 
EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - NIGHT 
The area in front of the Sun-Up. Dave's wagon pulls up to the hitching rail in front of the saloon. Clint, stripped of his gun, is driving with Dave, alertly watching him. They get down from the wagon and Dave prods Clint toward the corner of the building. 
EXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT 
Garvey has left the spot where we saw him look up to Rocklin's window. We now see him as he rounds a rear corner of the building and goes toward the outer stairs leading to the Sun- Up's second floor. He starts up the steps and stops almost immediately and stares o.s. 
ANGEL 
From Garvey's ANGLE as he sees Dave bringing Clint from around in front of the building toward the stairway. 
CAMERA HOLDS 
Garvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position around the roar corner. He watches the two men approach the stairway and go up. He moves out of the shot now, going toward the street. The CAMERA HOLDS on the corner, and we see Tala come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact position at the building's corner vacated by Garvey only a moment before. It is apparent that he is watching Garvey, and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of the scene. 
INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT 
PANNING SHOT on Rocklin asleep. He is fully dressed, as we last saw him, with the exception of his boots. He is stretched full length on top of the covers. His gun-belt still hangs over the rocker, close to the open window. A knock on the door brings him to a sitting position. 
ROCKLIN Come in -- 
CAMERA PANS TO door as Clint enters reluctantly, followed by the triumphant Dave. 
DAVE Here he is, Rock. Caught him jist in time near the Santee. Headed fer out, I'd say. 
ROCKLIN Sit down, Clint. (to Dave, as he reaches into his pocket) How about goin' down below an' havin' one on me? 
He tosses Dave a coin, who catches it. Then Rocklin puts on his boots. 
DAVE (delighted) Well, now -- that's right thoughtful -- Holler if you need me. 
Dave exits. 
CLINT (belligerently, as he stands near the window) What's this all about? 
ROCKLIN (calmly, as he stands up) It ain't gonna do you any good to get all het up and tough, kid -- 
Rocklin begins rolling a cigarette as he moves toward Clint. 
ROCKLIN I just want to ask you a few questions -- that's all. 
EXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT 
An unidentifiable form is seen moving through the darkness toward the outer stairway. As it nears the stairway, the CAMERA MOVES IN so that as the mysterious figure begins stealthily up the stairs, we see only the feet through the rungs. 
The CAMERA THEN PANS QUICKLY AND ZOOMS INTO A CLOSE SHOT of Juan, across the alley. And now through Juan's eyes we watch the ascent of the mysterious intruder: The Mexican's line of vision gradually raises, then the eyes slowly move across the camera as the dark figure proceeds along to the rear portion of the verandah. 
INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT 
Rocklin finishes rolling his cigarette and lights it. 
CLINT I told you once, I don't know who owns that pouch-- and I don't know who shot you. 
ROCKLIN (calmly) Forget it -- that's not what I want to talk to you about, anyway. 
CLINT (harshly) Well, what do you want to talk about? Come on, get it over with. 
EXT. VERANDAH - REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT 
The mysterious form has moved past the darkened windows along the verandah and is nearing Rocklin's lighted room -- stops close to the open window. 
INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT 
SHOT -- Rocklin and Clint. 
ROCKLIN Clint -- I want you to tell me why Garvey murdered Red Caldwell -- 
Clint tenses -- stares -- finds breathing difficult. 
ROCKLIN You know -- don't you? 
CLINT (shaking) Me? No! 
ROCKLIN Oh yes you do. (advancing on him) And you're going to tell me all about it. 
CLINT I don't know nothing, I tell you -- I -- 
Rocklin slaps Clint's face open-handed, throwing him off balance, then grabs him by the shirt front. 
ROCKLIN Talk! 
CLINT I tell ya, I... 
ROCKLIN (hitting him again) Talk! 
Completely terrified, Clint opens his mouth as if about to speak. Suddenly he sees something out of the shot over Rocklin's shoulder and his expression changes. Rocklin looks quickly in the same direction. 
MED. SHOT 
window. A gloved hand has come out of the dark and is reaching through the window for Rocklin's gun in the belt which is hanging over the chair. 
CLOSE SHOT 
Clint and Rocklin. The latter is still looking toward the window. With a swift movement Clint picks up the water jug from the washstand and brings it down on Rocklin's head. As Rocklin falls out of shot, Clint turns to the window with a triumphant smile. Suddenly his expression changes. 
CLINT (in a hoarse scream) No! No, don't! 
There is a shot from o.s. and Clint's hands go to his stomach. With a gasp of pain he doubles up and collapses on the floor.

ELIZABETH You see? When you sing loud enough and when your signs are big enough, people listen! Mary spots some of the news vans pulling away. 
MARY Steve! 
ELIZABETH Go, go on. I'll watch your stuff. Mary drops her bags, runs toward the media camp. 
EXT. OKLAHOMA MEDIA CAMP - NIGHT 
Josh pulls the back doors of the van shut. 
INT. RENTAL VAN - NIGHT 
Angus at the wheel, Hartman in the passenger seat. In the back, Steve nervously looks out the windows. Josh gets in next to him. Angus starts driving slowly across the grass behind other news vans. Steve finally relaxes. 
EXT. RENTAL VAN - NIGHT 
As the van drives, Mary runs to catch up. 
MARY Steve! STEVE! 
INT. RENTAL VAN - NIGHT 
Hartman spots Mary in the rear view mirror. 
HARTMAN Angus, hold up. 
Steve sees what Hartman's looking at. 
STEVE No, go. Fast. Hartman rolls down his window. 
STEVE Don't. Hartman sticks his head out the window. 
STEVE Hughes, I swear I'll kill you. Hartman waves to Mary to catch up. Angus sees her in the mirror as he drives. 
ANGUS Is that her? She's hot. 
STEVE Angus, come on man, get me out of here. 
ANGUS She's really hot. 
STEVE Who cares? Jesus, you guys - Angus hits the brakes. Steve hides behind the seat just as Mary catches up with the van. 
HARTMAN Hi beautiful. Mary tries to get a look at Steve but can only see part of his back hunched over behind the seat. 
MARY Steve? Are you okay? Is he okay? Angus leans over to her window. 
ANGUS I don't think we've met. Angus. Mary shakes Angus' hand. He can't take his eyes off her. 
HARTMAN Steve's not feeling well. 
MARY Oh no. 
HARTMAN I'm sure he'll be fine by the time we get to New Mexico. 
ANGUS Your eyes are striking. Steve punches him through the seat. Mary's oblivious. 
MARY Thank you. 
HARTMAN Steve really wants you to follow us. It would mean a lot to him. 
STAYS Steve cringes, goes to speak up but stops himself and hidden.

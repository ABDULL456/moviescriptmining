110 ON MOTL AND ARKADY 110 
MOTL LUBCZANSKI She is a tasty one, your aristocrat. 
TUVIA She is not my aristocrat. 
ARKADY LUBCZANSKI No? We were told, 'hands off,' property of the Commander. Tuvia just stares, daring him to continue. 
111 LATER THAT DAY 111 Tuvia walks past the now-empty stable heading into the woods. A voice calls out of the misty snow. 
VOICE 
HALT! WHO GOES THERE--! 
TUVIA Lazar. I am coming from camp. The danger is from those coming to camp. 
LAZAR 
(SHEEPISH) Sorry, Tuvia...

111 CONTINUED: 111 
TUVIA No sign of the food mission? 
LAZAR Not yet. Tuvia looks anxiously into the deep woods. 
111A MEANWHILE - DEEP IN THE WOODS 111A Lilka and Shulman are walking backwards, retracing their steps to obscure their footprints in the drifting snow. 
SHULMAN We mustn't have any tracks leading back to base. He loads two sacks of food onto her shoulders. 
SHULMAN (CONT'D) Stay on this side of the creek until you reach the river then up the hill. (points the way) I'll wait here for the others. She nods and trudges on toward camp through waist-deep snow. 
112 BACK IN CAMP - OUTSIDE A MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY 112 As they head toward a zemylanka, Riva is briefing Tuvia on the sick. Every now and then, he glances toward the woods. 
RIVA --several cases of pneumonia... Also I'm beginning to see signs of scurvy. No one's had a vegetable in weeks. 
LAZAR Tuvia! Lazar is dragging a WOUNDED MAN back into camp. 
RIVA Bring him to the infirmary. Tuvia glances back toward the woods. Looks at his watch. 
RIVA (CONT'D) ...Shulman will look after her. He looks up. She looks at him sympathetically. Apparently his interest in Lilka isn' quite as secret as he imagines. 
112A BACK TO THE WOODS 112A Exhausted, cold and alone, Lilka is becoming increasingly disoriented in a snowy landscape where every tree looks

DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 73A. 
112A CONTINUED: 112A alike. She turns in a circle, trying to decide which way to go. A MANGY DOG appears out of nowhere, its coat matted, its ribs showing, a wild look in its eye. It GROWLS ferociously. 
LILKA Shoo-- Shoo--

DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 74. 
112A CONTINUED: (2) 112A But the dog, as ravenous as she, smells the food and won't back down. It inches forward, FOAMING at the mouth. Lilka tries to step back but the dog LUNGES, snapping its jaws. It's terrifying. She looks desperately for help. Suddenly the dog LEAPS at her. She turns away and it rips a sack from her shoulder, knocking her down. Viciously it begins tearing the sack apart in search of the food within. A SHOT RINGS OUT. The dog drops. Lilka holds the smoking gun in two hands. Grimly, she pockets the weapon, picks up the sack of food, and starts off. Reconsidering, she walks back and hoists the dead dog onto her shoulder, too. More food. 
112B IN THE INFIRMARY 112B Riva bandages Edjelman's head. Tuvia looks at all the sick. 
TUVIA What's wrong with them all? 
RIVA If it's typhus we're in trouble. The lice are carriers. 
ASAEL The partisans have ampicillin. But they say they need it for themselves. In the background Lilka enters, face scratched, blood smeared hands and arms -- like some kind of primitive huntress. 
ASAEL (CONT'D) (sees he is distracted) Tuvia... 
TUVIA Medicine for typhus. I heard you. I'll go see Viktor right away. On his way out, he passes Lilka, who is being looked after. 
TUVIA (CONT'D) Are you all right? 
LILKA Fine. (handing him the gun) Thank you. Tuvia can clearly see that she is shaken -- but he has no time to ask more. He has to find out about the medicine. 
TUVIA I must go.

113 THE PARTISAN ENCAMPMENT (TO ESTABLISH SNOW) 113 
114 INSIDE A TENT 114 Viktor, Gramov and Zus are poring over a map of the area. 
VIKTOR --and every time we try to move, they radio back to police HQ which houses the transmitter...here.

There are good nights.  Kane's car is at the curb and he starts to walk toward it with Junior and Emily. 
EMILY I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver - 
KANE But I'd arranged to go home with you myself. 
EMILY There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles. 
KANE It can wait. 
EMILY No, it can't. (she bends down and kisses Junior) Good night, darling. 
JUNIOR Good night, Mom. 
The driver is holding the rear door open as Emily guides Junior in. 
KANE (as car starts to drive off) What's this all about, Emily? I've had a very tiring day and - 
EMILY It may not be about anything at all. 
A cab has pulled up. 
THE DRIVER Cab? 
Emily nods to him. 
EMILY I intend to find out. 
KANE I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind. 
EMILY I'm going to - (she looks at a slip of paper in her hand) - 185 West 74th Street. 
Kane's reaction indicates that the address definitely means something to him. 
EMILY If you wish, you can come with me... 
Kane nods. 
KANE I'll go with you. 
He opens the door and she enters the cab.  He follows her. 
DISSOLVE: 
INT. CAB - NIGHT - 
Kane and Emily.  He looks at her, in search of some kind of enlightenment.  Her face is set and impassive. 
DISSOLVE: 
EXT. AND INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT - 
Kane and Emily, in front of an apartment door.  Emily is pressing the bell. 
KANE I had no idea you had this flair for melodrama, Emiliy. 
Emily does not answer.  The door is opened by a maid, who recognizes Kane. 
THE MAID Come in, Mr. Kane, come in. 
They enter, Emily first. 
INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - 
There is first a tiny reception room, through which an open door shows the living room.  Kane and Emily enter from the hallway and cross to the living room.  As they enter, Susan rises from a chair.  The other person  in the room - a big, heavyset man, a little past middle age - stays where he is, leaning back in his chair, regarding Kane intently. 
SUSAN It wasn't my fault, Charlie.  He made me send your wife a note. He said I'd - oh, he's been saying the most terrible things, I didn't know what to do...  I - (she catches sight of Emily) 
ROGERS Good evening, Mr. Kane. (he rises) I don't suppose anybody would introduce us.  Mrs. Kane, I am Edward Rogers. 
EMILY How do you do? (pauses) I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me... (she consults the note in her hand without reading it again) because I recieved this note - 
ROGERS I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first - (he smiles grimly) but she did it. 
SUSAN I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea - 
KANE (turning on Rogers) Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected. (he starts toward him) To start with, I'll break your neck. 
ROGERS (not giving way an inch) Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane. 
EMILY Charles! (he stops to look at her) Your - your breaking this man's neck - (she is clearly disgusted) would scarcely explain this note - (glancing at the note) Serious consequences for Mr. Kane - (slowly) for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss - 
SUSAN (stiffly) I'm Susan Alexander. (pauses) I know what you think, Mrs. Kane, but - 
EMILY (ignoring this) What does this note mean, Miss Alexander? 
ROGERS She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it. 
KANE In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman - (he puts a world of scorn into the word) is - 
ROGERS I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one.  I don't even know what a gentleman is. (tensely, with all the hatred and venom in the world) You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs.  Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had.  Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper. Or his mother. (he has to control himself from hurling himself at Kane) It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman. 
EMILY Oh!! 
KANE You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -

KRISTINA Swear on my life. 
GEORGE I swear on your life. 
EXT. VERO BEACH AIRFIELD - DUSK 
George, Ben and G.G. wait on the tarmac.  George is pacing. The sound of a Cessna is heard and soon it is dropping out of the sky.  The plane lands and taxis over. 
Kevin and Leon stick their fists out of the airplane in triumph.  The men quickly unload the plane into the trunks of two Broncos and the back of a truck. 
INT. FT. LAUDERDALE HOUSE - NIGHT 
WE FOLLOW the duffel bags out of the Bronco into the house. The boys sit around as George samples the product. 
KEVIN Are we good? 
GEORGE Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance. 
He looks the boys over. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen. 
LEON Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large. 
GEORGE I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out. Starting over.  Cheers. 
They clank.  George gets up and does the Snoopy Dance to the bathroom. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Yeah!  Unbelievable.  Dulli, pour us another round.  I gotta hit the head. 
George leaves the room.  The camera slowly pans back to the guys.  Something doesn't look right.  They have not moved. They look bummed.  Leon looks at G.G. 
LEON What? 
G.G. I feel bad. 
BEN Me too.  He's not such a bad guy. 
KEVIN Fuck you guys.  All of you.  I've known him for thirty fucking years.  Fucking George. 
LEON Yeah, I like him, too.  But what's done is done.  So let's not get all sentimental about it, okay? 
The CAMERA PANS BACK SLOWLY to the bathroom door, George comes back into the room, dancing.  He goes and sits down with the guys. 
GEORGE (laughing) Dulli, I was just thinking about that time we landed in Mexico.  You've gotten a lot better since then, huh pal? Remember that fucking landing strip? Huh? 
George is the only one smiling.  No one is looking at him. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) Hey, what's wrong fellas?  Why the long faces? 
He looks at each one.  He slowly realizes something's up.  He looks to Dulli finally. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) (defeated) No.  C'mon, Dulli. 
The front door busts down, agents pour in.  The CAMERA SWISH PANS to George.  Lights out.  Slow motion.  Slow dolly into XCU. 
EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1999 - DAY 
George has tears in his eyes.  He is frozen.  Paralyzed by the memories. 
GEORGE Oh, no. 
INT. FT. LAUDERDALE HOUSE - 1989 - DAY 
The voices from the bust can be heard as the CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY into George's face.  Surreal. 
GEORGE (V.O.) I was busted.  Set up by the FBI and the DEA.  That didn't bother me.  Set up by Kevin Dulli and Derek Foreal to save their own asses.  That didn't bother me. Sentenced to sixty years at Otisville. That didn't bother me. 
EXT. MIRTHA'S HOUSE - MIAMI - 1989 - DAY 
Nine-year old Kristina Sunshine Jung sits on the front porch as the sun goes down.  Her bags are packed and ready to go. 
GEORGE (V.O.) I had broken a promise.  Everything I loved in my life goes away. 
INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - 1989 - DAY 
George is led into a small room and greeted by his lawyer, ARCHIE ZIGMOND. 
ZIGMOND Here's the deal, George.  You're not getting out.  I tried to get you furloughed, but your mother squashed it. Said it would only upset him.  I'm sorry. 
George takes it in.  Blinks.  The years have not been kind.

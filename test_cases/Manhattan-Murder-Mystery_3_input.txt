CAROL The urn is missing. It's gone. Yeah, I think it might have been. He had this satchel last night. He was carrying this bag, and I think that might have been what he had in his satchel. 
TED'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Close shot of Ted's back. He is still seated at his desk and talking on the phone 
TED Listen, I'd get out of there right away, if I were you. 
The camera moves around Ted, showing the typewriter he is typing on. TED No, no, no. Go, go, go. We'll do... We'll talk more from your apartment. 
PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Same shot of Carol on the phone. 
CAROL He's not going snorkeling with his brother. He's got two tickets to Paris, and he's got reservations at the Georges Cinq hotel with a woman named Helen Moss. 
She turns around, because she feels she heard a noise in the landing hallway. 
LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAY 
One of Paul's neighbor is standing in the hallway, waiting for the elevator. He's got some documents in his hand. The elevator dings and the door opens. Paul comes out. NEIGHBOR Oh. Hi. How are you ? 
PAUL Good morning. How are you ? 
Paul has his key in his hand and is ready to open his apartment door. 
NEIGHBOR Good. You got the notice on the... Uh, maintenance increase ? 
Paul turns around to look at the neighbor. 
PAUL No. When did that happen ? 
PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Close shot on Carol, whispering in the phone and looking toward the front door. 
CAROL I'm gonna look around and see what else I can dig up here, okay ? Yeah. I'm telling you, this is just... Ted, I-I'm just dizzy with freedom. This is just... uh, this is just the craziest thing I've ever done. 
TED'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Close-up shot on the ashtray, where a cigarette is burning slowly. The camera pans to a close-up shot on Paul's face, still on the phone. 
TED Yes, it's crazy. But soon, we'll be too old to do anything crazy. Go, leave, leave, leave. 
PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Carol puts the phone down on the desk. She stands and turns around when she hears the front door opening. 
Black screen shot on the front door in the dark of the corridor, then the camera quickly spins around to show Carol, standing in the living-room, with a frightened look on her face. She walks away from the room. The camera spins back to the front door, which opens. Paul enters and switches the lights on. He closes the front door, and walks along the corridor to the living-room. 
Carol walks into the kitchen from the living-room. 
The camera pans to Paul, looking for something on his desk. He looks through all the documents scattered on the desk. 
The camera pans back to Carol, hiding in the kitchen, then back to Paul. Paul opens both his hands in a gesture of despair : apparently, he hasn't found what he was looking for. He starts walking across the room, and the camera pans back to Carol in the kitchen. She rushes out of the kitchen. 
The camera remains at the same spot, and we see Paul in the living-room, still looking for whatever he is missing. He walks out of the living-room through the kitchen. 
PAUL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Paul enters the room, looking in the inner pocket of his jacket. He walks around the room, and opens a closet. He looks through the hanging clothes, and finds a few documents in one of the jackets. He closes the closet, and starts looking through the documents he has found. He puts them inside the inner pocket of his jacket. He starts walking out of the room, when the phone rings. He stops and picks up the phone receiver on one of the night-tables. 
PAUL Hallo. 
Medium shot of Carol hiding under the bed. We notice she doesn't have her glasses anymore. 
PAUL (voice over) Oh, hi. Yeah. I know. I-I...Yes, I miss you, too. I did. I made all the arrangements. 
Back to Paul standing by the bed and talking in the telephone. 
PAUL Yeah, look. I... Okay, I have to run. But I'll see you later, okay ? Okay. 
He puts the phone down on its hook, and starts walking out of the room. He stops, thinks for a couple of seconds, turns around, sits on the bed and picks up the phone. Back to Carol under the bed. The bed frame hits her back when Paul sits on it. She looks up. We hear Paul dialing a number. 
PAUL (voice over) Extension five. Well, keep ringing, would you please ? Because I just talked to her. What ? Okay. Uh, will you tell her... yes, tell her that Tom called. Tom. Thank you. 
Back to Paul sitting on the bed. He puts the phone down on its hook, stands up and starts walking out of the room. 
Back to Carol under the bed, waiting for Paul to get out of his apartment. 
NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY 
Starting from street level, the camera tilts up along a very modern office building, all glass and steel. A sign, above the main entrance, says «10 East 53». This is the building where Larry's office is located. LARRY'OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY 
Full shot of a large office room. In the forefront, a reception desk, with a young female receptionist talking to someone we still don't see. Coming from the other end of the room, Larry is walking with Marcia, a tall dark-haired lady, wearing sunglasses. 
LARRY So, I thought your rewrites were great. I really think you helped your book, you know ? It's... It's dense a little bit, but, uh... 
MARCIA Well, I don't want it to be too transparent, I mean... 
They are now at the reception desk level, and, since the camera is following them, we can see the young gentleman the receptionist is talking with. 
LARRY That's... That's something you're never gonna have to worry about, you know ? This book makes «Finnegan's Wake» look like airplane reading, you know ? But-But it's long. It's- It's-It's... 
They are now walking along a corridor. 
MARCIA You know, you're the only editor in the world I'll take suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it. 
LARRY No, I'm not pushing it. I think the book is great. Absolutely great. You know, but, uh... how much, how much of Dorothy is you? As I was reading it, I kept thinking how much is... you know, how much did you base it on your own life ? They have now reached a smaller room, actually Larry's private room. Marcia takes her glasses off, and then her coat, and sits on a sofa. 
MARCIA Well, I was a waitress. I lived with a poet. I was a film critic. 
LARRY (voice over) Right, but not-not a blackjack dealer, right ? 
MARCIA No, but I put myself through school playing poker. 
The camera pans to Larry, who is standing up at the other end of the room, looking through some documents. 
LARRY Oh, really ? Do you still play ? 
MARCIA (voice over) No, but I still know how. LARRY Yes ? Are you good ? 
MARCIA (voice over) Yeah. 
LARRY Yeah, because maybe you could give me some pointers. 
MARCIA (voice over) I could turn your game around in two hours. 
LARRY Could you ? That's great. That's... you know, you-you have all these skills, and you're beautiful, and you can write so well... and now it turns out you play poker. This is, uh, too good to be true. 
Larry sits down with the pile of documents on his laps. The camera pans back to Marcia. She has a cigarette in her hand. 
MARCIA Well, I wouldn't say beautiful. 
LARRY (voice over) Oh, I would. 
MARCIA But I do have tremendous sex-appeal. 
The camera pans back to Larry, who is looking through the huge pile of paper on his laps, perhaps a manuscript. 
LARRY Okay, you sold me. Are-are you seeing anybody ? 
MARCIA (voice over) No. Don't let my confidence fool you, it's a facade. Why do you ask ? 
LARRY Because I have a friend who became single recently, and I-I know he would get a big kick out of you. 
MARCIA (voice over) Oh. So, when do you want your poker lessons ? 
LARRY Uh, next week. I could take you to lunch. We could-we could, um, I'll put you on my expense account, and you could... teach me when to... bet and when to fold. 
MARCIA (voice over) How about a cheeseburger right now ? 
The phone rings.

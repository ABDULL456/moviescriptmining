FAYAH What is this? Who brought this animal in? 
All the children chatter their innocence at once. The Monkey chatters too; it's an entertainer. The Monkey jumps from the children's table to the adults' and struts slowly up toward Marion, who thinks it's the cutest thing she ever saw. When it reaches her, it takes off its turban and does a deep, grand bow to her. She is delighted and takes the Monkey into her arms. The Monkey kisses her cheek. The children laugh. 
MARION Why, thank you. I like you too. 
FAYAH Then it shall be welcome in our house. 
MARION Oh, no! You don't have to have it around if you don't want it - 
SALLAH (cheerfully) All of Allah's creatures are welcome here. You please us by letting us please you. 
EXT. COURTYARD - SALLAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Indy and Sallah sit in the small, protected courtyard. Sallah holds the two sections of the headpiece, the medallion and the base, and has for the first time fitted them together. They fit perfectly and complete the headpiece. He peruses the markings on the headpiece quizzically. Indy is cleaning and loading a .45 automatic. 
INDY I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah. They couldn't have an excavation in the desert without the best digger in Egypt. 
SALLAH All Arabs look alike to them, Indy. 
INDY Tell me about the map room at Tanis. 
SALLAH We found it three days ago. I broke through myself. 
INDY Those Nazis are moving awfully fast. 
SALLAH The Frenchman is helping them. 
Indy reacts. 
INDY Belloq. So he got away from the Indians. This is going to be more interesting that I thought. 
SALLAH I'm afraid this has put the Germans close to finding the Well of the Souls. 
INDY (indicates the headpiece) Even Belloq won't be able to find it without that. Can you make anything of those markings? They're nothing I'm familiar with. 
SALLAH (shakes his head "no") But I know someone who might. You can go to see him tomorrow. (a worried expression) Indy... something bothers me. 
INDY What is it, my friend? 
Sallah finds it hard to say. When he finally speaks, his words are accompanied by a strange, eerie, foreboding rush of wind through the courtyard. Just a coincidence we might suppose. 
SALLAH It is the Ark. If it is there, at Tanis... It is not something man was meant to disturb... Death has always surrounded it. It is not of this earth. 
The wind dies down. Indy shakes off a chill and stares thoughtfully at his friend. 
EXT. HEAVILY TRAFFICKED CAIRO STREET - DAY 
Indy and Marion are briskly walking along one of Cairo's busy bazaar streets. Vendors with fine cloth, pottery, baskets, jewelry, etc line the street. Marion has the Monkey from Sallah's house on her shoulder. 
INDY Do you really need that monkey? 
MARION I'm surprised at you, Indy. Talking that way about our baby. He's got your looks, too. 
INDY And your brains. 
As Indy and Marion turn a corner, the Monkey seems to notice something and immediately jumps from Marion's shoulder and hurries off at a frantic pace down the street.

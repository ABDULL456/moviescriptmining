{"train": "Scientist (all shaking hands) I'm going to contact the other offices. \nMewtwo Who am I? Where is this place? What was I born for? (Mewtwo floats up and starts destroying the whole lab. Then tons of little metal hand like things come down to stop him but he just blows them up. Soon the whole lab is in flames.) \nScientist To make the strongest pok\u00e9mon ever.. that was our dream... (The whole lab blows up. Giovanni, the leader of Team Rocket comes down in a chopper and confronts Mewtwo.) \nMewtwo Is this my power? I'm the strongest pok\u00e9mon in the world. Mew. Am I stronger then you? \nGiovanni You surly are the strongest pok\u00e9mon in the world. But there is another that would be the strongest. \nMewtwo The humans? \nGiovanni \n(nods) If you and a human were to cooperate then the world would be ours. \nMewtwo is sent into an arena to fight pok\u00e9mon first an Onix which Mewtwo throws into a wall with his mind. Then it shows Mewtwo out in a field with a lot of wild Tauros. He raises them up with his mind control and TR throws pok\u00e9balls out and catches them all. Then it shows Mewtwo in the gym again fighting Alakazam, Mewtwo does just what he did to Onix. Then came Electron and he used an electric attack and Mewtwo reflected it back at him. Next came Gary's Arcanine and Nidoking... he took care of them easily. Next scene, back in Giovanni's lab. \nMewtwo What am I fighting for? What am I living for? \nGiovanni You are a pok\u00e9mon. Pok\u00e9mon made by humans, what else are you worth? \nMewtwo My worth? Who am I? What do I live for? (Mewtwo starts breaking free of the wires) \nGiovanni What are you doing? \nMewtwo I was made by humans. But I, who was created by humans, am not even a pok\u00e9mon. (Mewtwo blows up the place and flies off while all his armor slowly falls of into the sea. He lands on a rock.) Who am I? Where is this place? Who asked to make me? Who wished to make me? I hate everything that made me! So this is neither an attack not a declaration of war but revenge on you who made me! \nIntroduction \n(Brock is cooking lunch for everyone.) \n(runs over to him) Okay! I must have a solid fight! \nMisty I thought you couldn't move one millimeter? \nAsh Just one or two pok\u00e9mon fights before breakfast. \nBrock This is lunch, so that would be before lunch. \nPikachu pika..chu... \n(Has the Japanese Pok\u00e9mon intro music through this battle the whole time. Ash pulls out a pok\u00e9ball and throws out Bulbasaur. Then the pirate throws out Donfan. Bulbasaur charges and Donfan rolls into a ball and hits Bulbasaur, then turns around and hits him again! Then he tries it again but Bulbasaur uses Solar Beam and Donfan faints. The Pirate then sends out Machamp. Ash sends out Squirtle. Machamp kicks Squirtle down and then goes to kick him again but Squirtle dodges it and bubbles him till Machamp faints. The pirate gets mad and throws 3 pok\u00e9balls down. one is a Venomoth another is a Golem and the other is a Pinsir. Pikachu jumps off ashes shoulder and does Thundershock and all 3 faint.) \nPirate Oh My God! (this was possibly the funniest part of the entire movie :) \nAsh I did it! \nScene change. We see Mewtwo waving his hand back and forth moving the clouds, causing a big storm to start. We then see mew sleeping in a bubble underwater as the bubble floats to the top and pops, Mew wakes up and flies off. Ash and everyone run out of the storm and into a ocean side house that has all the other trainers who were invited. \nA Trainer Calm down Kingler! Cut it out! (Our heroes run inside wet.) \nAsh It was a beautiful day! \nBrock The weather along this beach can change easily. (we notice a big crowd of trainers by the door and Officer Jenny standing with a woman talking to them all) \nCrowd Huh? The ferry has been canceled? \nSweet We can't go to the New Island?! \nCrowd Oh No! We were invited to go! \nOfficer Jenny Be quiet everyone. Here is the Pier Master. \nBrock Beautiful... Who? I've seen her somewhere before... (Some of the trainers go outside in the storm wanting to cross the ocean. Soroa gets onto his Pidgeot and flies off. Umio gets on his Gyarados and swims across.) \nOfficer Jenny Stop! Stop or I'll arrest you! (Sweet gets on her Dewgong and starts swimming away.) \nBoijer There's no use trying to stop them. After all they're pok\u00e9mon trainers. If they were children who would stop after being told to, they wouldn't have gathered here. Let's just pray for there safety. (Ash, Brock, Misty and Pikachu run outside and see everyone leaving.) \nAsh Across the sea lives the strongest trainer in the world. I can't cop out now. \nMisty But we can't cross this sea using our pok\u00e9mon. \nAsh Right. (A Small wooden ship pulls up with 2 people in it. Guess who?) \nJessie Want a ride? Not saying that it's free but depending on the situation. I might allow you onboard. (They get on and start going and Meowth is dressed like a girl in front of the boat, then a huge wave and Team Rocket's costumes fall off. then the waves start getting really rough.) \nAsh You guys! You guys again?! \nAsh How's this? (He shows her). \nB rock That was you just as I thought! \nLady Yes? \nBrock That picture of Nurse Joy I saw in the missing person report at the pier was you. \nMisty That reminds me, she looks like her. \nLady I don't know what your talking about. I've been serving this castle ever since I was born. Come this way. The other guests are already waiting. \nThey go inside and Team Rocket floats up from the water on top of Weezing. Then it shows Mew playing with the windmill on top of the castle. MEANWHILE Ash and everyone are inside the castle. \nLady Those are the trainers who have already arrived. \nMeowth The s..s..sewer!? I'm not a brown rat! \nJessie Don't complain! (All of a sudden Mew comes down from behind TR and looks at them. Jessie turns her head but Mew disappeared.) \nJames What's wrong Jessie? \nJessie Nothing lets go. \nMeanwhile... \nSorao You came too? \nAsh You? \nSorao I flew here. My Pidgeot can cross such a hurricane in one flight. Everyone greet them! (all his pok\u00e9mon say their names Then they see a Gyarados.) \nMisty That voice! \nBrock Telepathy! (Mewtwo raises Umio up in the air and throws him into a pool (using his mind) \nUmio Darn it! Go Gyarados! (Gyarados attacks with Hyper Beam, it goes to Mewtwo and Mewtwo stops it and turns it around and it hits Gyarados causing it to faint.) \nMewtwo That was easy. (looks at Joy) I no longer have any need for you anymore. (Joy faints into Brock's arms) \nBrock Nurse Joy. \nNurse Joy Where is this place? Why am I here? \nMewtwo To make you take care of me, I took you from the Pok\u00e9mon Center. A doctor who is familiar with pok\u00e9mon is convenient. You were quite useful. You don't remember anything though. \nBrock What did you say? \nJessie Meowth! (Both Jessie and James start pull to get Meowth out and they do get him out but not before the machine got 3 hairs from off of his tail.) \nMeowth OUCH! My hair! (on the computer screen a figure of a Meowth shows up and the computer starts saying some weird stuff then in an empty test tube next to Team Rocket, a Meowth falls down from a pipe into it) \nAll of TR MEOWTH?! \nMeowth I am Meowth. \nJames Then this is.... Meowth's copy? (Mew appears behind Team Rocket again.) \nComputer But the copy we created is more than we've imaged. The pok\u00e9mon which we found.... in the depths... it's name is Mew... We succeeded in finding fossilized eye lashes of a mew. From the gathered components we created Mewtwo with this machine. The goal was to make the strongest pok\u00e9mon with our own hands. That was our dream. But soon Mewtwo displayed unmeasurable violence. Its all over. The research office will be destroyed. The only way left to abandon this place and escape. (the computer shuts off) \nJessie This is the research office? \nJames I think so. \nMewtwo What did you say? You're not being controlled? You're with the humans because you want to be? To be with them by itself is wrong. (Mewtwo lifts Pikachu up with his mind and throws him but Ash jumps back and catches him!) \nPikachu pika! \nAsh Pikachu! \nMewtwo Weak pok\u00e9mon rely on humans. \nMisty Ash! Are you ok? \nAsh Yeah. How dare you attack Pikachu?! \nSoroa We can get him no matter what kind of pok\u00e9mon he is, as long as he's a pok\u00e9mon, GO RYHORN! (Ryhorn charges at Mewtwo and is 1 inch from him and Mewtwo stops him and raises him into the air, and shoots Ryhorn across the room!) \nSoroa Ryhorn! \nSoroa They are...? (Everything starts shaking and a huge door opens and inside is a pok\u00e9mon battle field.) \nBrock A battle field? Is he going to have a pok\u00e9mon battle? \nSoroa I've got Venusaur for that copy one! \nSweet I've got Blastoise for that copy one! \nAsh I've got Charizard too. Charizard I chose you! (Charizard comes out and gives Mewtwo and evil look then shoots fire out at him but Mewtwo makes a force field around him so it doesn't even touch him.) Charizard, that's a surprise attack. (Mewtwo shoots up water and the fire goes out.) \nMewtwo What a bad tempered Charizard. So who's first? (Soroa's Venusaur walks out.) \nSoroa I was careless before, but it won't go that way this time. \n(The copied Venusaur walks out.) \nMisty Where are the speed attacks? \nBrock The enemy is to fast! (Copied Charizard grabs Charizard and starts flying down to the ground!) \nAsh Charizard! \nMewtwo Dive Bomb Slam! \nCharizard hits into the ground then gets up.. roars loudly.. then faints. \nAsh \n(Runs out to Charizard) Hold on Charizard! Are you okay? \nMewtwo Both speed and power are lacking. (Mewtwo then throws his hands up and 3 black pok\u00e9balls appear he shoots them all out and captures Sweet's Blastoise another gets Soroa's Venusaur and the other captures ashes Charizard! A small gold statue lifts up and the 3 balls shoot down into the hole.) \nAsh I've got it! Take your own pok\u00e9mon back to your own pok\u00e9balls! Return Squirtle and Bulbasaur! (they both go back into their pok\u00e9balls) \nMewtwo It's no use. (2 black pok\u00e9balls go to Ash, open, and capture the pok\u00e9balls Bulbasaur and Squirtle are in!) Nothing is impossible with the black pok\u00e9balls I have made. (Misty puts Togepy in her bag and shuts it tight while Brock holds Vulpix close.) \nNurse Joy This place is no good. Let's run outside! (Nurse Joy, Psyduck, Misty and Brock start running but then a black ball catches Psyduck) \nMisty My Psyduck! (A black ball catches Vulpix.) \nBrock Vulpix! (Pikachu is being hunted down by tons of black pok\u00e9balls! Then Pikachu falls and is about to be caught! But Ash jumps in front of him and the pok\u00e9balls hit him.) \nAsh Run Pikachu! (Pikachu is running and starts climbing the spiral stairs with ash running after him. Pikachu keeps using Thundershock to blow up all the pok\u00e9balls around him but more keep coming! Ash starts running up the stairs a little behind Pikachu) Don't give up Pikachu! (Pikachu gets tired and he accidentally falls of the stairs! Ash jumps after him and is about to grab him but then a black pok\u00e9balls snatches Pikachu! But Ash catches the pok\u00e9ball and then falls into some water but when he does the pok\u00e9balls slips out of his hands and goes into the hole. Since it was the last pok\u00e9mon the statue starts to drop but Ash just barely makes it and jumps down into the hole after the Pikachu in the ball! Team Rocket is still in the Lab, which is where all the copies are going. They are amazed at all the copies dropping into all the test tubes everywhere but then Ash falls down chasing after Pikachu!) \nJessie Brat? \nAsh I'm sorry, I don't have time to deal with you today! (Ash jumps and grabs Pikachu's pok\u00e9ball but right when he does about 25 little metal mini hand like things come down trying to keep Pikachu, Ash is fighting off the mini hands.) Let it go! Darn it! Let him go! Let go of my Pikachu! Let go! (All the hands break and the whole copy machine starts blowing up and Pikachu comes out of his ball.) Pikachu! \nMeanwhile up stairs... \nMewtwo Humans, I won't take your lives too. Leave here. \nThe doors open to the exit. \nMewtwo That is if you an make it out in that storm. \nThen there is an explosion and all the copied pok\u00e9mon come walking out. \nMewtwo What happened here? \nFrom the smoke, Ash and all the original pok\u00e9mon come walking out. \nAsh I can not forgive...! I will not forgive you! \nMewtwo The real one is real?.... Fine! (Mewtwo shoots another black electric ball at Mew but Mew dodges it and just barely misses Ash! Ash then starts climbing down the statue.) Lets decide which is the real one without skills. You're the stronger ones, GO! (All the copies start attacking their originals. The copies are winning. Mewtwo makes a visible blue force field around himself. Mew does the same except its pink and they fly up high in the air and keep ramming into each other. Then Pikachu is looking around at the big copy war then he sees his copy standing there ready to fight him! Pikachu can't believe it.) \nNurse Joy What is this fighting? Both the real ones and copies are alive now. \nSweet Everyone is a living thing \nBrock Though they were created, there are living beings that live in this world. \nMisty The real ones and the copies... But both of them are the same living things. There's no such thing as a win and losing. \nJames If we were asked that, I wouldn't know what to say \nJessie I feel so sorry \nJames They're bullying themselves. \nMeowth Talking about the moon at a time like this is tasteful. Its philosophical. (Meanwhile Mew and Mewtwo are still bouncing around fighting. And Ash finally makes it back to the ground.) \nAsh \n(looks at everyone fighting and getting so tired) That's Enough! Stop! \nBrock Ash! \nAsh I've got to stop them. \nBrock No. The battle will continue unless Mew and Mewtwo stop fighting. \nNurse Joy Animals don't hand over there territory to the same type of animal. \nMisty oh no. \nMew mew. \nMewtwo It might be better if no one knows about us, or any of this... \nMew mew... (Mew and Mewtwo start flying away and then all the copies pok\u00e9mon lift up into the air and fly with them!) \nAsh Why are you going everyone? \nMewtwo \n(flying away with all the copies) We were born and alive. We will continue to live somewhere in this world. (All of a sudden the whole castle fills up with bright light and everyone disappears......... Now we are back where all the trainers what to go on the ferry.) \nOfficer Jenny The ferry has been canceled! There's a hurricane coming! \nNurse Joy \n", "test1_input": "Movie: MewTwo Strikes Back ***This is not an official manuscript.

(Camera goes into a darker place with orange bubbles then it shows someone's eye open. Human figures are seen outside where he is.) Where is this? Who am I? Who brought me here?

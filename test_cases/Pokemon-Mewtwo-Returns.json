{"test1_input": "Jessie I got a frying pan... \nMeowth What good is such a thing without meat and vegetables? It's just an iron board. \nA Fearow with a camera flies over head then it shows inside some place where you can see Ash and Pikachu on the screens. \nLady Are you sending them an invitation? \nMewtwo Certainly. (Dragonite flies out of the control center with a purse. It flies over the sees and then over Team Rocket and they fall then it flies over Ash and everyone's head knocking them all over then she lands.) \nAsh What are you? (Dragonite hands Ash an invitation) This? For me?

We should go for it. \nAsh I don't feel uncomfortable with being told I'm a promising future trainer. \nMisty Well then check yes on the card. \n(They check yes, and hand the invitation back to Dragonite. Dragonite takes the card and flies off but Jessie, James and Meowth take out a net in an attempt to steal this rare pok\u00e9mon.

(looks at Joy) I no longer have any need for you anymore. (Joy faints into Brock's arms) \nBrock Nurse Joy. \nNurse Joy Where is this place? Why am I here? \nMewtwo To make you take care of me, I took you from the Pok\u00e9mon Center. A doctor who is familiar with pok\u00e9mon is convenient. You were quite useful.

(Jessie walks away and sits on some button and a computer turns on with a very fuzzy screen.) \nComputer ...our study... to continue in our research ... we would have to collect samples from our test subjects...

(2 black pok\u00e9balls go to Ash, open, and capture the pok\u00e9balls Bulbasaur and Squirtle are in!) Nothing is impossible with the black pok\u00e9balls I have made.

(Pikachu is running and starts climbing the spiral stairs with ash running after him. Pikachu keeps using Thundershock to blow up all the pok\u00e9balls around him but more keep coming! Ash starts running up the stairs a little behind Pikachu) Don't give up Pikachu! (Pikachu gets tired and he accidentally falls of the stairs! Ash jumps after him and is about to grab him but then a black pok\u00e9balls snatches Pikachu!

Since it was the last pok\u00e9mon the statue starts to drop but Ash just barely makes it and jumps down into the hole after the Pikachu in the ball!

They are amazed at all the copies dropping into all the test tubes everywhere but then Ash falls down chasing after Pikachu!) \nJessie Brat? \nAsh I'm sorry, I don't have time to deal with you today! (Ash jumps and grabs Pikachu's pok\u00e9ball but right when he does about 25 little metal mini hand like things come down trying to keep Pikachu, Ash is fighting off the mini hands.) Let it go!

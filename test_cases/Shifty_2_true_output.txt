BOB No, no, no, no, no, no, no... 
TREVOR Bob! 
Bob comes around from his side of the desk. 
BOB No, Trevor, no. 
TREVOR Bob just hear me out. 
BOB Get out of my office. 
TREVOR Bob please I've paid out on all the materials, I've lost money. 
BOB You should have thought about that before you started bringing drugs onto my site. 
TREVOR You owe me money. 
BOB I owe you fuck all. 
TREVOR YOU OWE ME MY FUCKING MONEY. 
BOB Tell it to the police, and I'll tell `em why you got kicked off the fucking job. 
TREVOR Bob, please. 
BOB Fuck off, Trevor. 
Bob turns and walks out the porta-cabin. Trevor follows. 
TREVOR Bob. 
Bob ignores him. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) Bob I need this money. 
Bob stays quiet, approaches a workman and starts talking to him. Trevor stands behind them. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) Bob! 
Bob turns to him, and puts out his hand. 
BOB Thank's for coming today Trevor, we'll definitely be in touch. 
Bob's hand hangs there. Trevor looks at him, to the hand. Bob turns away and carries on talking. Trevor stands for a moment then turns and walks away. Trevor's face is awash with emotion, it looks like he wants to cry but he holds it together.

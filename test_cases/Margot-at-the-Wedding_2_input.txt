MARGOT (suddenly) Paul, what are you doing getting married to this guy? He's not good enough for you. He's so coarse, he's like guys we rejected when we were sixteen. You know...don't make a mistake like this. (pause) I'm sorry, maybe I have no right to say that, but you know I'm truthful so... Would you rather I lie? 
PAULINE Who should I be with then? 
A smashing sound. Margot steps outside: Two hooded figures turn over a recycling can, glass smashes on the ground. Garbage is strewn across the driveway. 
MARGOT (O.S.) Hey! Hey, you! You pick that up. I will call the police. This is our property. Pick that up. 
Pauline remains seated at the table, stunned.    Margot comes back inside. 
MARGOT Creeps. 
53   EXT. DRIVEWAY - MORNING                                     53 
Malcolm crams the trash back in the cans. He sees something amidst the milk cartons and corn husks. He reaches down and lifts up a severed pig's hoof. 
54   EXT. FIELD - MORNING                                        54 
Claude and Ingrid idle in the tall grass calling to Wizard. 
CLAUDE Dogs usually come back, I think. 
INGRID What happened to your dad? 
CLAUDE He went to Vermont. 
INGRID He didn't want to come to the wedding? 
CLAUDE I don't think he could...    I think he couldn't. (pause) You want to see me dance? INGRID Okay. Claude dances. The gangly weeds blow around him. There's a rustling in the brush. A patch of fur catches Ingrid's eye. INGRID (under her breath) Wizard... 
The animal is gone. 
A figure appears in the distance behind Claude. The boy, the Vogler's son, approaches shirtless in swimming trunks. Ingrid's attention goes to him. 
CLAUDE You're not watching. 
The boy comes into focus. He holds a dead squirrel by its tail. Ingrid backs up next to Claude. The boy stops a few feet away and hurls the squirrel at them. The kids jump back as it lands at their feet. 
BOY Where are you going? 
CLAUDE (stopping) We have to get home. 
BOY Is that your girlfriend? 
CLAUDE No, she's my cousin. 
BOY You a fruity? 
CLAUDE Um...no. 
BOY (to Ingrid) You a fruity? 
INGRID (with certainty) No. BOY We will hurt you. Claude takes Ingrid's arm and they start to walk away. INGRID He's a Vogler. 
CLAUDE He's just a stupid boy. 
Claude sneaks a look over his shoulder -- the boy follows. Claude's gait quickens. 
INGRID Hold it, I have a rock in my sandal. 
CLAUDE Come on, Ingrid. 
Ingrid slows, lifts her leg and removes a sandal. The boy is behind them. Claude yanks Ingrid's arm and she topples over.

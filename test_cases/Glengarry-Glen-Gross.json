{"train": "Glengarry Glen Ross \nGLENGARRY GLEN ROSS \nby \nDavid Mamet \nSCENE ONE \nA booth at a Chinese restaurant, Williamson and Levene are seated at the booth. \nLEVENE John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look: (pause) The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the... \nWILLIAMSON Shelly, you blew the last... \nLEVENE No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't \"blow\" them.  No.  I didn't \"blow\" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed... \nWILLIAMSON ...you didn't close... \nLEVENE ...I, if you'd listen to me. Please.  I closed the cocksucker. His ex, John, his ex, I didn't know he was married...he, the judge invalidated the... \nWILLIAMSON Shelly... \nLEVENE ...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say. \nWILLIAMSON (pause) What about the other two? \nLEVENE What two? \nWILLIAMSON Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say... \nLEVENE ...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down... \nWILLIAMSON ...no... \nLEVENE ...do you want to go downtown...? \nWILLIAMSON ...no... \nLEVENE ...then... \nWILLIAMSON ...I only... \nLEVENE ...then what is this \"you say\" shit, what is that? (pause) What is that...? \nWILLIAMSON All that I'm saying... \nLEVENE What is this \"you say\"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there? \nWILLIAMSON Roma. \nLEVENE Under him? \nLEVENE ...ah, fuck this... \nWILLIAMSON The...Shelly? (pause) The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per... \nLEVENE That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross. \nWILLIAMSON Either way.  You're out. \nLEVENE I'm out. \nWILLIAMSON Yes. \nLEVENE I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John. (MORE) \nLEVENE (CONT'D) I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per... \nWILLIAMSON ...they kicked out. \nLEVENE They all kick out.  You run in streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm... I'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone. Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around. (pause) I need your help. \nPause. \nWILLIAMSON I can't do it, Shelly. \nPause. \nLEVENE Why? \nWILLIAMSON The leads are assigned randomly... \nLEVENE Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me? \nWILLIAMSON ...apart from the top men on the contest board. \nLEVENE Then put me on the board. \nWILLIAMSON You start closing again, you'll be on the board. \nLEVENE I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a \"test,\" alright?  As a \"test\" and I promise you... \nWILLIAMSON I can't do it, Shel. \nPause. \nLEVENE I'll give you ten percent. \nPause. \nWILLIAMSON Of what? \nLEVENE And what if you don't close. \nLEVENE I will close. \nWILLIAMSON Can't do it. \nLEVENE I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel. (pause) John? (pause) We do that, for chrissake? \nWILLIAMSON No. \nLEVENE I'm asking you.  As a favor to me? (pause) John. (long pause) John: my daughter... \nWILLIAMSON I can't do it, Shelly... \nLEVENE Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. \"Mur, this new kid burns my ass.\" \"Shelly, he's out.\" You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once... \nWILLIAMSON I have to go... (gets up) \nLEVENE Wait.  Alright.  Fine. (starts going in pocket for money) The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have. \nWILLIAMSON I can't split them. \nPause. \nLEVENE Why? \nWILLIAMSON Because I say so. \nLEVENE (pause) Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...? \nWilliamson gets up, leaves money on the table. \nLEVENE You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...? \nWILLIAMSON You want something off the B list? \nLEVENE Yeah.  Yeah. \nWILLIAMSON Is that what you're saying? \nLEVENE That's what I'm saying.  Yeah. (pause) I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am. (pause) What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you. \nWILLIAMSON That's alright. \nLEVENE The deal still stands, our other thing. \nWilliamson shrugs.  Starts out of the booth. \nLEVENE Good.  Mmm.  I, you know, I left my wallet back at the hotel. \nSCENE TWO \nA booth at the restaurant.  Moss and Aaronow seated.  After the meal. \nMOSS Polacks and deadbeats. \nAARONOW ...Polacks... \nMOSS We're stuck with this fucking shit... \nAARONOW ...this shit... \nMOSS It's too... \nAARONOW It is. \nMOSS Eh? \nAARONOW It's too... \nMOSS You get a bad month, all of a... \nAARONOW You're on this... \nMOSS All of, they got you on this \"board...\" \nAARONOW I, I...I... \nMOSS Some contest board... \nAARONOW I... \nMOSS It's not right. \nAARONOW It's not. \nMOSS No. \nPause. \nAARONOW And it's not right to the customers. \nMOSS I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years. \nAARONOW That's right? \nMOSS Eh...? \nAARONOW That's right? \nMOSS Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: \"Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before.\" \nAARONOW ...that's right... \nMOSS Eh? \nAARONOW No.  That's absolutely right. \nMOSS And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to... \nAARONOW ...that's right... \nMOSS Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is? \nAARONOW What? \nMOSS Starting up. \nAARONOW What hard part? \nMOSS Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is? \nAARONOW What? \nMOSS Just the act. \nAARONOW What act? \nMOSS To say \"I'm going on my own.\" 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those... \nAARONOW That's right... \nMOSS He made up those rules, and we're working for him. \nAARONOW That's the truth... \nMOSS That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: \"Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked.\" \nAARONOW Huh. \nMOSS You don't ax your sales force. \nAARONOW No. \nMOSS You... \nAARONOW You... \nMOSS You build it! \nAARONOW That's what I... \nMOSS You fucking build it!  Men come... \nAARONOW Men come work for you... \nMOSS ...you're absolutely right. \nAARONOW They... \nMOSS They have... \nAARONOW When they... \nMOSS Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no. (pause) No. (pause) You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something. \nMOSS No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this? \nPause. \nAARONOW Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just... \nMOSS No, we're just... \nAARONOW We're just \"talking\" about it. \nMOSS We're just speaking about it. (pause) As an idea. \nAARONOW As an idea. \nMOSS Yes. \nAARONOW We're not actually talking about it. \nMOSS No. \nAARONOW Talking about it as a... \nMOSS No. \nAARONOW As a robbery. \nMOSS As a \"robbery\"?!  No. \nAARONOW Well.  Well... \nMOSS Hey. \nPause. \nAARONOW So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff. \nMOSS Not actually, no. \nPause. \nAARONOW You didn't? \nMOSS No.  Not actually. \nAARONOW Did you? \nMOSS What did you say? \nMOSS Yes. (pause) I said, \"Not actually.\" The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking... \nAARONOW We are? \nMOSS Yes. \nMOSS Is that what I said? \nAARONOW He'd give me a job. \nMOSS He would take you on.  Yes. \nPause. \nAARONOW Is that the truth? \nMOSS Yes.  It is, George. (pause) Yes.  It's a big decision. (pause) And it's a big reward. (pause) It's a big reward.  For one night's work. (pause) But it's got to be tonight. \nAARONOW What? \nMOSS What?  What?  The leads. \nAARONOW You have to steal the leads tonight? \nMOSS That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest. \nAARONOW You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and... \nMOSS You... \nAARONOW I'm sorry? \nMOSS You. \nPause. \nAARONOW Me? \nMOSS You have to go in. (pause) You have to get the leads. \nPause. \nAARONOW I do? \nMOSS Yes. \nAARONOW I... \nMOSS It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth. (pause) \"The fucking leads\" et cetera, blah blah blah \"...the fucking tight ass company...\" \nAARONOW They'll know when you go over to Graff... \nMOSS What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case. \nPause. \nAARONOW Dave. \nMOSS Yes. \nMOSS That's right. \nAARONOW Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...? \nMOSS That's none of your fucking business... \nAARONOW Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal... \nMOSS You went for it. \nAARONOW In the abstract... \nMOSS So I'm making it concrete. \nAARONOW Why? \nMOSS Why?  Why you going to give me five grand? \nAARONOW Do you need five grand? \nMOSS Is that what I just said? \nAARONOW You need money?  Is that the... \nMOSS Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...? \nAARONOW What is the five grand? (pause) What is the, you said that we were going to split five... \nMOSS I lied. (pause) Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences. \nAARONOW I do? \nMOSS Yes. \nPause. \nAARONOW And why is that? \nMOSS Because you listened. \nSCENE THREE \nThe restaurant.  Roma is seated alone at the booth.  Lingk is at the booth next to him.  Roma is talking to him. \nROMA ...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it. (pause) You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...? \nLINGK Did I...? \nROMA Yes. \nLINGK I don't know. \nROMA Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them? \nWILLIAMSON They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left. \nROMA They didn't get my contracts. \nWILLIAMSON They--excuse me... \nHe goes back into inner room with the Detective. \nROMA Oh, fuck.  Fuck. (he starts kicking the desk) FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!! (goes to the door Williamson went into, tries the door; it's locked) OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON... \nBAYLEN (coming out) Who are you? \nWilliamson comes out. \nWILLIAMSON They didn't get the contracts. \nROMA Did they... \nWILLIAMSON They got, listen to me... \nROMA The... \nWILLIAMSON Listen to me: They got some of them. \nROMA Some of them... \nBAYLEN Who told you...? \nROMA Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me. \nBAYLEN (looking back toward the inner office) Moss...Who told him? \nROMA How the fuck do I know? (to Williamson) What...talk to me. \nWILLIAMSON They took some of the con... \nROMA ...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed... \nWILLIAMSON You closed him yesterday. \nROMA Yes. \nWILLIAMSON It went down.  I filed it. \nROMA You did? \nWILLIAMSON Yes. \nROMA Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac. \nWILLIAMSON I... \nROMA And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car. \nROMA I was at home, where were you? \nAARONOW At home. \nROMA See...?  Were you the guy who broke in? \nAARONOW Was I? \nROMA Yes. \nAARONOW No. \nROMA Then don't sweat it, George, you know why? \nAARONOW No. \nROMA You have nothing to hide. \nAARONOW (pause) When I talk to the police, I get nervous. \nROMA Yeah.  You know who doesn't? \nAARONOW No, who? \nROMA Thieves. \nAARONOW Why? \nROMA They're inured to it. \nAARONOW You think so? \nROMA Yes. \nPause. \nAARONOW But what should I tell them? \nROMA The truth, George.  Always tell the truth.  It's the easiest thing to remember. \nWilliamson comes out of the office with leads.  Roma takes one, reads it. \nROMA Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue? \nWILLIAMSON If you don't want it, give it back. \nROMA I don't \"want\" it, if you catch my drift. \nWILLIAMSON I'm giving you three leads.  You... \nROMA What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's... \nWILLIAMSON The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town... \nAaronow sticks his head out. \nAARONOW Can we get some coffee...? \nMOSS How ya doing? \nPause. \nAARONOW Fine. \nMOSS Uh-huh. \nAARONOW If anyone's going, I could use some coffee. \nLEVENE \"You do get the...\" (to Roma) Huh?  Huh? \nMOSS Fuck is that supposed to mean? \nLEVENE \"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does...\" \nMOSS Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts? \nPause. \nLEVENE I got 'em in the kitchen.  I'm eating her crumb cake. \nMOSS What does that mean? \nROMA It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you. (pause) And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth. \nMOSS You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...? \nLEVENE Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the... \nMOSS Shut the fuck up. (pause) Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you... (to Levene) And what the fuck are you babbling about...? (MORE) \nMOSS (CONT'D) (to Roma) Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it. (pause) You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right. \nROMA Who said \"Fuck the Machine\"? \nMOSS \"Fuck the Machine\"? \"Fuck the Machine\"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to... \nLEVENE Dave... \nMOSS ...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board... \nROMA Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry... \nMOSS Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz... \nROMA Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. \"How much you just ingested,\" what a big man you are, \"Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. (MORE) \nROMA (CONT'D) I'll show you how to chew it.\" Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are... \nLEVENE Get 'em to me! \nWILLIAMSON I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's... \nLEVENE Did you tell 'em my sale? \nWILLIAMSON How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine. \nLEVENE It's better than a good sale.  It's a... \nWILLIAMSON Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense... \nLEVENE All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale. \nWILLIAMSON The only thing remarkable is who you made it to. \nLEVENE What does that fucking mean? \nWILLIAMSON That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle. \nLEVENE Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your \"end of month board...\" You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust... \nWILLIAMSON I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly. \nLEVENE Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me? \nWILLIAMSON It's not impossible. \nLEVENE On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon. \nROMA You closed 'em today? \nLEVENE Yes.  I did.  This morning. (to Williamson) What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's... \nROMA ...yes... \nLEVENE ...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it. \nROMA That's right, Shel. \nLEVENE And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of \"marshaling your sales force...\" What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you. \nROMA He's right, Williamson. \nWilliamson goes into a side office.  Pause. \nLEVENE It's not right.  I'm sorry, and I'll tell you who's to blame is Mitch and Murray. \nRoma sees something outside the window. \nROMA (sotto) Oh, Christ. \nLEVENE The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for... \nROMA You're sure? \nLEVENE (nods) Go ahead. \nROMA Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he? \nLEVENE No, his wife is. \nROMA Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...? \nLEVENE Twelve-fifteen. \nROMA Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane! \nLEVENE Didn't I say I was taking the two o'... \nROMA No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth. \nLEVENE Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one... (getting up) Well, let's scoot... \nLINGK I've got to talk to you... \nROMA I've got to get Ray to O'Hare... (to Levene) Come on, let's hustle... (over his shoulder) John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. (MORE) \nROMA (CONT'D) (to Lingk) I'll see you...Christ, I'm sorry you came all the way in...I'm running Ray over to O'Hare...You wait here, I'll...no. (to Levene) I'm meeting your man at the bank... (to Lingk) I wish you'd phoned...I'll tell you, wait: are you and Jinny going to be home tonight? (rubs forehead) \nLINGK I... \nLEVENE Rick. \nROMA What? \nLEVENE Kenilworth...? \nROMA I'm sorry...? \nLEVENE Kenilworth. \nROMA Oh, God...Oh, God... (Roma takes Lingk aside, sotto) Jim, excuse me...Ray, I told you, who he is is the senior vice- president American Express.  His family owns 32 per...Over the past years I've sold him...I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  I promised five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight. (sighs) I have to go.  You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I have to go. (MORE) \nROMA (CONT'D) It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see. (he checks his datebook) Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go? \nLINGK My wife... \nRoma rubs his head. \nLEVENE (standing in the door) Rick...? \nROMA I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. (starts for the door) \nLINGK My wife said I have to cancel the deal. \nROMA It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again... (to Levene) This woman can cook... \nLINGK That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out. \nROMA You don't count Saturday. \nLINGK I'm not. \nROMA No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day. \nLINGK But I'm not counting it. (pause) Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed. \nROMA What would have elapsed? \nLINGK If we wait till Mon... \nROMA When did you write the check? \nLINGK Yest... \nROMA What was yesterday? \nLINGK Tuesday. \nROMA And when was that check cashed? \nLINGK I don't know. \nROMA What was the earliest it could have been cashed? \nPause. \nLINGK I don't know. \nROMA Today. (pause) Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case. \nLINGK The check wasn't cashed? \nROMA I just called downtown, and it's on their desk. \nLEVENE Rick... \nROMA One moment, I'll be right with you. (to Lingk) In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which (looks around) I can't talk to you about here. \nDetective puts his head out of the doorway. \nBAYLEN Levene!!! \nLINGK I, I... \nROMA Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed. \nBAYLEN Levene! \nROMA Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed. \nROMA (to Aaronow) Will you excuse... \nAARONOW Where did Moss...?  I... \nROMA Will you excuse us please? \nAARONOW Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant? (pause) I...I... (exits) \nROMA I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you. \nLINGK It's not me, it's my wife. \nROMA (pause) What is? \nLINGK I told you. \nROMA Tell me again. \nLINGK What's going on here? \nROMA Tell me again.  Your wife. \nLINGK I told you. \nROMA You tell me again. \nLINGK She wants her money back. \nROMA We're going to speak to her. \nLINGK No.  She told me \"right now.\" \nROMA We'll speak to her, Jim... \nLINGK She won't listen. \nDetective sticks his head out. \nBAYLEN Roma. \nLINGK She told me if not, I have to call the State's attorney. \nROMA No, no.  That's just something she \"said.\" We don't have to do that. \nLINGK She told me I have to. \nROMA No, Jim. \nLINGK I do.  If I don't get my money back... \nWilliamson points out Roma to Baylen. \nBAYLEN Roma! (to Roma) I'm talking to you... \nROMA Forget the deal, Jimmy. (pause) Forget the deal...you know me.  The deal's dead.  Am I talking about the deal?  That's over.  Please. Let's talk about you.  Come on. (pause.  Roma rises and starts walking toward the front door) Come on. (pause) Come on, Jim. (pause) I want to tell you something.  Your life is your own.  You have a contract with your wife.  You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there...and there are other things.  Those things are yours.  You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew.  This is your life. (pause) Yes.  Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me.  Now let's go. Right now. \nLingk gets up and they start for the door. \nBAYLEN (sticks his head out of the door) Roma... \nLINGK ...and...and... \nPause. \nROMA What? \nLINGK And the check is... \nROMA What did I tell you? (pause) What did I say about the three days...? \nBAYLEN Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch... \nROMA I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in. (checks watch) I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson. \nBAYLEN The people downtown said... \nROMA You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...! \nWILLIAMSON Yes. \nROMA Mr. Lingk and I are going to... \nWILLIAMSON Yes.  Please.  Please. (to Lingk) The police (shrugs) can be... \nLINGK What are the police doing? \nROMA It's nothing. \nLINGK What are the police doing here...? \nWILLIAMSON We had a slight burglary last night. \nROMA It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk... \nWILLIAMSON Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to... \nROMA John... \nWILLIAMSON Your contract went out to the bank. \nLINGK You cashed the check? \nWILLIAMSON We... \nROMA ...Mr. Williamson... \nWILLIAMSON Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case. \nLEVENE ...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that... (blocking his way) you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right. (pause) You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed. \nPause. \nWILLIAMSON Mmm. \nLevene lifts up his arm. \nLEVENE Now I'm done with you. \nPause. \nWILLIAMSON How do you know I made it up? \nLEVENE (pause) What? \nWILLIAMSON How do you know I made it up? \nLEVENE What are you talking about? \nWILLIAMSON You said, \"You don't make something up unless it's sure to help.\" (pause) How did you know that I made it up? \nLEVENE What are you talking about? \nWILLIAMSON I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank. \nLEVENE Well, hadn't it? \nWILLIAMSON No. (pause) It hadn't. \nLEVENE Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying? \nWILLIAMSON Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that? (pause) You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk? \nLEVENE You're so full of shit. \nWILLIAMSON You robbed the office. \nLEVENE (laughs) Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure. \nWILLIAMSON What'd you do with the leads? (pause, points to the Detective's room) You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk. \nLEVENE I don't know what you are saying. \nWILLIAMSON If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail. \nLEVENE I... \nWILLIAMSON I don't care.  You understand? Where are the leads? (pause) Alright. \nWilliamson goes to open the office door. \nLEVENE I sold them to Jerry Graff. \n", "test1_input": "Pause. \nAARONOW It is dead. \nROMA It's a waste of time. \nAARONOW Yes.

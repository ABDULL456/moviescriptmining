YOURS,/ WHEN YOU KNOW SHE WOULD GO 
WITH YOU,/ IF THERE ONLY WERE DOORS. 
BOTH 
AGONY!/ OH THE TORTURE THEY TEACH! 
R'S PRINCE 
WHAT'S AS INTRIGUING-- 
C'S PRINCE 
OR HALF SO FATIGUING-- 
BOTH 
AS WHAT'S OUT OF REACH? C-PRINCE studies his reflection in the water. 
C'S PRINCE 
AM I NOT SENSITIVE, CLEVER,/ WELL- 
MANNERED, CONSIDERATE,/ PASSIONATE, 
CHARMING,/ AS KIND AS I'M HANDSOME,/ 
AND HEIR TO A THRONE? 
R'S PRINCE 
YOU ARE EVERYTHING MAIDENS COULD WISH 
FOR! 
C'S PRINCE 
THEN WHY NO--? 
R'S PRINCE 
DO I KNOW? 
C'S PRINCE 
THE GIRL MUST BE MAD. The R-PRINCE scales a hanging vine as if it were RAPUNZEL'S hair. 
R'S PRINCE 
YOU KNOW NOTHING OF MADNESS/ TILL 
YOU'RE CLIMBING HER HAIR/ AND YOU SEE 
HER UP THERE/ AS YOU'RE NEARING HER,/ 
ALL THE WHILE HEARING HER,/ "AH-AH-AH- 
AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH--" 
BOTH 
AGONY! 
C'S PRINCE 
MISERY! 
R'S PRINCE 
WOE! 
BOTH 
THOUGH IT'S DIFFERENT FOR EACH. 
C'S PRINCE 
ALWAYS TEN STEPS BEHIND-- 
R'S PRINCE 
ALWAYS TEN FEET BELOW-- 
BOTH 
AND SHE'S JUST OUT OF REACH./ AGONY/ 
THAT CAN CUT LIKE A KNIFE! 
I MUST HAVE HER TO WIFE. PULL BACK to reveal the PRINCES side by side on a precipice, overlooking the distant castle. 
EXT. RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - NIGHT 
The BAKER'S WIFE fights her way through a thicket. Her clothes are now ratty, her face scratched - but she approaches the tower with trepidation. 
WIFE Rapunzel, Rapunzel? Let your hair down to me. The window at the top of the tower opens and RAPUNZEL sticks out her head looking downward. The WIFE hides to the side. 
RAPUNZEL 
(DUBIOUS) Is that you at this hour, my Prince? 
WIFE (in her best princely 
BASS VOICE) Yes. RAPUNZEL thinks about it for a moment, then lowers her hair. The WIFE approaches it gingerly. 
WIFE (CONT'D) Excuse me for this. She takes a fist full of hair and gives it a pull. Nothing. She tries once again, this time with more force eliciting a little yelp from RAPUNZEL. Finally, she holds on to the hair and just starts running away from the tower as fast as she can. We hear RAPUNZEL yell as the WIFE succeeds in pulling some of the hair from her head. 
EXT. PATHWAY TO THE CASTLE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Cinderella flees the castle. 
BAKER (V.O.) As the Baker's Wife bolted from the tower, the second night of the festival was thrown into chaos when Cinderella once again ran from the Prince. While the BAKER'S WIFE continues to run away from Rapunzel's tower, in the distance she sees a flutter of gold moving through the moonlit trees. CINDERELLA? She changes course in pursuit. SERIES OF SHOTS with MUSIC CLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S SHOES as they make their way through wooded path. ANGLE ON THE WIFE as she races towards them in pursuit. The WIFE catches up with CINDERELLA and tackles her to the ground, CINDERELLA'S slipper falling off. They both dive for the slipper, when an approaching noise catches the WIFE'S attention. 
C'S PRINCE (O.S.) Over here! CLOSE-UP on the shoe as CINDERELLA snatches it from the ground. CINDERELLA rushes off. The WIFE stares frozen in horror as the PRINCE'S HORSE races towards her. She lets out a scream and the horse stops short, rearing up. The STEWARD'S horse charges off the path into thickets. 
C'S PRINCE (CONT'D) Who is she? Where did she go? 
WIFE 
(BOWING) I have no idea, sir.

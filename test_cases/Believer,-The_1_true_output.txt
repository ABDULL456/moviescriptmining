A WRISTWATCH: 12:05. We are: 
EXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT 
Danny hoists himself onto the kitchen roof. Above him is an open window, candlelight flickering. He starts into the room, stops.... 
INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
Carla sits on the bed, straddling Curtis, who lies beneath her. She is looking right at Danny. Curtis, unaware of him, keeps thrusting into her from below. 
Danny starts to leave, but on second thought stays. Carla stares expressionless, yet more attentive to him than to Curtis. Indeed, their eyes never leave each other, so that when she becomes aroused, we understand that it is Danny she is responding to, Danny she is really making love to. 
Gradually her face loses its aloofness and seems to reach out to him, to reveal feelings that she can no longer deny. She holds her gaze until, at the final instant, she shudders out a series of stifled cries. 
When she looks again, the window is empty. 
INT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- DAY 
Danny reading. A KNOCK at the door. He looks up, Curtis comes in. Danny stiffens at the sight of him, but Curtis is friendly. 
CURTIS What are you reading? 
Danny tilts the book to show him: History of Political Philosophy. 
CURTIS Leo Strauss... (nods approvingly) I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye. 
DANNY What about Mrs. Moebius and...? 
CURTIS They left an hour ago. (off Danny's disappointment) You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on. (off Danny's silence) How soon can you get back to the city? 
DANNY A week or so. There's something I want to do here first. 
CURTIS What's that? (off Danny's silence) Okay. Surprise us... 
INT. DARKNESS -- NIGHT 
The sound of SPLITTING WOOD. Then VOICES in a cavernous space... 
CHAOS OF VOICES Ow, shit... You're stepping on my fucking -- ...Get off me...Goddammit... (sounds of PUNCHES, a SCUFFLE) Stop it!... Where's the light? 
One appears, illuminating nothing, dissipating into the still vaster darkness. A SERIES OF LIGHTS bang on in ecclesiastical bursts, illuminating: a vaulted ceiling... stained glass panels... We are: 
INT. SYNAGOGUE SANCTUARY -- NIGHT 
A dour, ornate place built in the early decades of the century. The sight of it silences everyone for a moment. Then... 
CARLETON Jew World...!! 
Drake, Billings, Carleton, O.L. and Steroid run wild... kicking over benches...spray-painting swastikas...hurling prayer books...urinating from the balcony... 
...Danny looks around like someone revisiting his childhood home: slides his hand along a pew back...leafs through a chumash...gazes up at the eternal lamp behind its red glass...the gilded doors of the ark... A hint of Kol Nidre MUSIC haunts him.... 
DANNY (to himself, barely a whisper) Shut up. Fuck you.... 
KYLE (O.S.) What...? 
Danny turns; Kyle is right behind him. 
DANNY Nothing. Where is it? (as Kyle hoists a sports bag) Okay, let's take one of these panels off so we can get under the bema...the stage. 
As they unscrew a panel, Carleton runs past. A football flashes overhead. We hear GLASS BREAK...LAUGHTER. 
INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- NIGHT 
DANNY WATCHES KYLE attach a bomb (four sticks of dynamite wired to a digital timer) to a 2x4 with a bungee cord. He hooks the ends, cautiously lets go. The cord springs free. The bomb falls. 
Kyle gasps. Danny catches it. 
Frozen, they look at each other. Kyle exhales, takes the bomb and, with Danny holding it, carefully restrings the bungee. A MECHANICAL NOISE overhead: 
STEROID (O.S.) Wow, look at this shit.... 
DANNY What are they doing? 
Kyle has no idea and doesn't care. Danny scrambles out. 
INT. SANCTUARY -- NIGHT

CUT TO: Solomon, Clemens Ray and Robert, now in mid-conversation. 
ROBERT I say we fight. Robert delivers this in a hushed voice. 
SOLOMON The crew is fairly small. If it were well planned, I believe they could be strong armed. 
CLEMENS RAY Three can't stand against a whole crew. The rest here are niggers, born and bred slaves. Niggers ain't got the stomach for a fight, not a damn one. 
ROBERT All I know, we get where we travelling we'll wish we'd died trying. 
CLEMENS RAY Survival is not about certain death, it is about keeping your head down. Solomon looks at Clemens Ray, agitated -- his voice now raised above the previous whispers. Grits his teeth. 
SOLOMON Days ago I was with my family, in my home. Now you tell me all is lost. "Tell no one who I really am" if I want to survive. I don't want to survive, I want to live.

47A EXT. SEA - DAY 47A 
The steamboat paddles pound the water, filling the whole frame. The vessel ploughs on south.

48A INT. HOLD - NIGHT 48A 
The slaves are asleep. A Sailor descends the ladder approaching Eliza. He bends down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her face. Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene. From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt the Sailor. The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back at him. Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the hold. As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand between Eliza and the Sailor. Stretching out a firm hand to the sailor's shoulder, Robert's look says "No you don't." Clemens Ray is awake now, watching. There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor and Robert, an impasse. We focus on the Sailor's face. Slowly, a greasy smile erupts upon it. Back now to Robert's face, a look of incomprehension. Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs. The sailor withdraws the bloody blade. A wide shot of the two men. Robert collapses to the floor like a sack of potatoes. Clemens Ray and Solomon react. Complete horror.

51 EXT. ORLEANS/DECK - DAY 51 
We are back up on the deck of the ship. SOLOMON AND CLEMENS RAY dump ROBERT's body over the side of the ship. Solomon watches as the body churns for a moment in the wake of the vessel... then sinks beneath the water. Clemens Ray, with no sentimentality: 
CLEMENS RAY Better off. Better than us. 
51A EXT. NEW ORLEANS HARBOUR - DAY 51A 
Solomon's POV from the back of the steamship of Robert's corpse slipping gracefully into the water. 
52 EXT. NEW ORLEANS/PORT - DAY 52 
-MID MAY, 1841- A white male, fairly smart, with broad shoulders, stands 
AND BELLOWS- 
RAY Clemens...! Clemens Ray! We are in the port of New Orleans, one of the busiest in the young nation. On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods are loaded and unloaded from a various ships. It's a bit of controlled chaos as a VARIETY OF LANGUAGES are spoken and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the Orleans to a holding pen. Solomon, and all the slaves are overwhelmed by all that is happening around them. Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the Orleans. They are JONUS RAY - Clemens Ray's master - and DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr. Ray. They both look like they mean business. The moment the gangplank is laid, Ray yells for Clemens. Clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight. He is, uncharacteristically beside himself. Ironically, his master now represents "freedom." 
(CONTINUED) 
52 CONTINUED: 52 
CLEMENS ...My master... Master Ray, sir! Master Ray! Clemens pulls on his chain. As he does so, Several other slaves collapse in his effort to reach his master, like dominos. 
RAY Who is in charge of this vessel? 
CAPTAIN I am the Captain. 
RAY I am Mr. Jonus Ray. My solicitor has documentation verifying that the Negro named Clemens Ray is my property. As he reads PAPERS handed to him by Davis: 
CAPTAIN I know nothing of-- 
RAY You are ordered by court to return that property immediately, or face charges of thievery. 
CAPTAIN My duty is to transport goods. I am not responsible for their origin. 
RAY Remove these contraptions! To his mate: 
CAPTAIN Free him! Biddee does as ordered. Once free, Clemens hugs and sobs over his master as would a lost and then found child. 
RAY It's all well, now, Clemens. You will return home with me. (to the Captain) Consider this notice and warning.

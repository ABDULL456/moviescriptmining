Pamela is diminutive on the back seat of the sprawling car. She eyes the champagne on ice, the flutes clinking in the in- car bar. 
PAMELA 
(TO HERSELF) Absurd. Ralph looks at her in the rearview. 
RALPH You okay back there Mrs P.L. Travers? 
PAMELA It's not Mrs P.L. It's just Mrs-- Oh, it's so hot. 
RALPH No problemo! We got a brand new air conditioning system, Missus; cool you right down in no time. Just about make you feel like you're in good old Engerland again! Things they can put in cars these days-- (he shakes his head in 
AMAZEMENT) Gosh almighty. Pamela presses her fingers to her temples. She looks around, finds a button, pushes it and the screen rises between passenger and driver miraculously relieving her of Ralph's natter. 
RALPH (CONT'D) (happy as a clam) No problemo. 
EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY 
With its pink facade and flag flying turrets the hotel resembles a candy castle simmering under a midday sun. The limo glides into the forecourt. 
INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY 
A porter opens the door to Pamela's suite and places her belongings on a luggage stand in the hallway. 
PORTER Would you like me to unpack for you ma'am? 
PAMELA Unpack? 
PORTER To take your items from their cases and hang them in the wardrobe ma'am. 
PAMELA Young man, if it is your wish to handle ladies garments I suggest you take employment in a launderette. The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door. 
PAMELA (CONT'D) Yes? His eyes flick to his empty palm and back to Pamela. She closes the door on him. 
PAMELA (CONT'D) Odd. She turns and for the first time takes in-- 
PAMELA (CONT'D) Oh my. --The LUDICROUS suite she has been assigned; it is opulent beyond imagine but it's classy decor has been rather diminished by the array of Disney gifts splattered across every surface of the room. 
PAMELA (CONT'D) Oh no, no, no. Disney Flowers, Disney champagne, Disney exotic fruit baskets, Disney chocolates, Disney posters, cuddly Donald, Pluto and Minnie toys and - taking up the entire bed - the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable. Imagine it. Nope. 
BIGGER! Pamela cannot contain her horror. She stares at it in disgust for a moment, and then her eyes fall upon three pears in the fruit basket. She stops still for a second before rushing over and picking them out. She turns them over in her hands before an enormous wave of panic washes over her. 
PAMELA (CONT'D) (muttering to the pears) This won't do. She throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is greeted with dry arid heat, dust, dazzling sunlight-- 
EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY 
--Arid heat, dazzling sunlight. Travers, Margaret and the children climb stand in a line at the top of a pathway. From their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling red dust; it obscures and then gradually reveals her new home. The surrounding land yellow and burnt - unlike the lush greens of Maryborough. The house is ramshackle and meagre. A swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few skinny chickens strut about the porch. 
TRAVERS A palace! Complete with mighty steed. 
GINTY And chickens. 
MARGARET 
OH-- Travers puts an arm around her shoulder. 
TRAVERS We'll build beautiful memories here my angel. Margaret offers him a trusting smile. 
MARGARET Yes. Travers takes Ginty and Biddy's hands and they run towards their new home. The chickens scatter. 
TRAVERS (in the distance) --in this house you get to share a bedroom! Margaret looks at the surrounding area, there's simply nothing but barren land and red dust for miles. 
EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - POOL - DAY 
UNDERWATER SPLOSH! A green bomb disturbs the tranquil surface and then another SPLOSH! We rise through the water to see Pamela on her balcony throwing the pears, one by one, into the swimmer-free swimming pool. 
INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
PAMELA Good riddance. She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors. 
PAMELA (CONT'D) 
(TO HERSELF) Well, first things first. She gathers up the Disney paraphernalia and shoves it all in a closet. She picks up her bags and goes through to the bedroom where the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable takes up the entire bed. Imagine it. Nope. BIGGER! 
PAMELA (CONT'D) Good Lord. Pamela drops her bags, grabs Mickey and places him on the floor, facing the wall. 
PAMELA (CONT'D) 
(TO MICKEY) And you can stay there until you learn the art of subtlety. Pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack. She takes from it a bottle of pills, which she places on her night stand, followed by another bottle and another and another. The potions keep coming, as do creams and books and make-up, the bag is endless. Things, things and more things come streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature Buddhas. Finally she takes out an impossibly large framed picture of herself. She holds it up, admires it, takes down an existing painting and replaces it with her own image.

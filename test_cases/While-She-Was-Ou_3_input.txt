She edges slowly up to meet the line of cars. Watches as the police car circumvents the traffic and pulls into the Mall road, to join a police car that already has the Mall entrance road blocked off. 
INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING 
Of course.    How long has it been? That poor security guard. 
She checks the car clock. It's only 85 minutes since she left the house! Hard to believe. Feels like another lifetime. 
Another cop car whizzes past the line. How long before they come for her? She's got to get back to the kids. 
Della adjusts the rearview mirror. Her gaunt bloody face looks back. 
DELLA Oh my. 
She looks at her hands, they're ingrained with mud and blood. And her clothes! 
While waiting for the traffic to start moving again she fumbles on the passenger seat, finds some kleenex. 
She wipes her hands, her face, using the rearview mirror, some Kleenex and the rest of the water. She looks only slightly better. 
The line starts moving. Della follows. She passes the police cars, steals a cursory glance. 
She keeps checking her face in the mirror. The cars soon start to disperse in different directions. The Mall disappears behind her. She turns left onto an almost empty road. 
She can't wait to see her babies, make sure they're okay. How could anyone expect her to go the speed limit at a time like this.

She hits forty, forty-five, fifty. Takes it all the way up to sixty. Runs a light. 
EXT. RAILWAY ROAD - EVENING 
As long as the roads empty she's gonna own it. 
INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING 
At sixty-five she races across the railway track. She slows down to just above speed limit when she sees a car ahead on the adjoining road. 
With one hand guiding the wheel she grabs the lipstick from her purse. 
She carefully applies it in the rearview but her mouth is so parched it just cakes into her chapped lips. She wipes it away. 
EXT. CROSSROADS - EVENING 
She drives through the crossroads. 
INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING 
She applies some lipstick to her cheeks to give her some color. But she just looks odd. She ends up wiping it away with the back of her hand. 
Gosh, this car in front is really taking its sweet time. She decides to overtake. She accelerates to sixty. As she passes the driver stares at her car. 
She slows down so as not to arouse any more suspicion. She passes the familiar sign for "Pleasant Valley Drive". The road's empty ahead so she guns it to sixty-five. 
The closer she gets to home, the faster she wants to go. She tries to resist but can't. The speedometer hits seventy. 
The car hurtles into the night. Oh No, a red light ahead. And a car waiting to go in the opposite direction. She decides to slow for this one. Barely makes it - screeches to a halt. The driver in the forward facing car checks her out. She attempts to smile and look like a normal housewife. 
EXT. PLEASANT DRIVE - EVENING 
She waits for the car to pass, then hits the accelerator again. She signals right, turns abruptly into meet the gates of Pleasant valley Dream Homes. 
Scene 130Page 94 
She rakes about in her purse for her chub card, can't find it. She presses the intercom. No one answers. She presses again. Still no answer. She backs out hard onto Pleasant Valley Drive. Luckily for her, the car she overtook a few minutes earlier pulls in. She tails the car tightly through the gates which scrape shut against her back bumpers. But she's in. 
She guns it along Pleasant Valley Crescent and slows as she approaches the sign for Pleasant Valley Boulevard. Checks herself in the mirror. Pulls into the boulevard. 
When she sees her house ahead a huge sob engulfs her. She snorts it back. Not yet. Her face hurts so bad with repressed emotion that it feels like it's made of stone. 
She pulls into the driveway. Smooths her coat. 
She glances at the gun, which lies on the passenger seat. 
She turns off the ignition. 
She looks back at the gun. She removes the car keys from the ignition. 
She glances at the gun. 
She looks at the house; it all looks normal. 
She takes a deep breath.

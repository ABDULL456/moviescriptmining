SURLY STAGE MANAGER Hey, Wood. Your check bounced. 
ED Okay, I'll get you the money later. 
SURLY STAGE MANAGER No.  I need it NOW. 
Ed nods grimly.  He grabs Loretta and takes her aside. 
ED Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money. 
LORETTA Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you? 
ED (he smiles) Yeah.  Exactly! 
There's a pause.  They stare at each other. 
ED I kinda need it now. 
LORETTA (baffled) What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred. 
ED Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand. 
LORETTA What other sixty-thousand? 
ED The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me. 
LORETTA You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars. 
CLOSEUP - ED 
He looks like he s going to throw up. 
ED Oh my God. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY 
The large stage door SLAMS shut. 
Ed's disoriented cast and crew stand in the street.  Bela, Tor, and Loretta are still in costume. 
Ed looks totally dazed.  He blinks in the bright sunlight. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT 
We're back at the Brown Derby, for another backers party.  The same banner is hanging: "BRIDE OF THE ATOM -- NEXT YEAR'S SMASH HIT!" 
The whole crowd is there, dressed up.  Bela sits in the corner, knocking back a drink. 
BELA Here we go again. 
Paul whispers to Bunny. 
PAUL MARCO So is Dolores coming? 
BUNNY (very catty) I can't imagine why.  I wouldn't put up with a boyfriend who sold me out for three-hundred dollars...! 
ON ED 
Ed stands with a circle of POTENTIAL BACKERS.  He has an edge of desperation we've never seen before. 
ED ...lemme tell you, you can't lose. It's scary!  And if you don't like that, it's romantic!  Bela Lugosi portrays Dr. Vornoff, and lovely ingenue Loretta King is reporter Janet Lawton. 
POTENTIAL BACKER Hmm.  Lugosi looks pretty old. (he squints across the room) Which role is Vampira playing? 
ED Vampira...? (bewildered) Why do you ask?? 
POTENTIAL BACKER Well I see her standing over there. 
The guy points.  Ed turns and looks and Vampira is standing in the next room.  She's at a different party. 
ED Well... she's playing -- (beat) Could you excuse me one moment?? 
Ed dashes from the room. 
NEXT ROOM OVER 
Vampira is drinking with a bunch of artsy-fartsy types.  She's in street clothes, but clearly recognizable.  Ed runs up. 
ED Excuse me, Miss Vampira? 
VAMPIRA Yes? 
ED (sweaty) You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood.  I'm a film producer.  I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson.  And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet! 
Vampira stares, totally uncomprehending. 
VAMPIRA I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph? 
ED No.  I think my film is perfect for you. 
VAMPIRA You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven -- 
ED (unyielding) No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be in it!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...? 
Vampire glances at her friends.  They uncomfortably turn away. 
VAMPIRA Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat -- 
ED (begging) Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard... 
VAMPIRA (pissed off) Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it! 
BACK AT THE PARTY 
The backers glance into the next room.  Ed is in front of Vampira, begging on his hands and knees. 
BACKER (to another backer) I'm getting a bad feeling about this. Let's get out of here. 
The backers pick up their coats.  Through the doorway, Ed sees this.  He jumps up and frantically runs back in. 
ED Where are you guys going?!  You can't leave! 
BACKER (running out) Goodbye, Mr. Wood. 
ED (insane) You can't go!  You haven't seen the storyboards! 
The backers run out of the room. They're gone. Ed shouts after them.

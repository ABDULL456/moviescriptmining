He crosses to her, putting his arm, around her, walking her back inside... 
WIGAND (CONT'D) They're nocturnal.  You know what that means?  That means that they only come out at nighttime. 
He locks the sliding glass door, takes a last look outside. 
INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE IN BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT 
The Phone suddenly RINGS.  Lowell asleep, alone...  He gets it... 
LOWELL (sleepy) Yeah... 
INT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, HALLWAY - LATE AT NIGHT 
It's dark, save a light from the living room.  Liane, in bed, seemingly sleeping.  And we see Jeffrey, just outside their door in the foyer, sitting on the floor against a curved wall, a drink at his side on the telephone...  A man with no one to talk to... 
WIGAND (after a beat) Lowell...  Jeffrey Wigand... 
INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT 
Lowell sits up... 
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) Is it too late? 
LOWELL No.  No, it's okay...  How's - how's the new place? 
INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT 
WIGAND The new place?  New. 
INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT 
LOWELL (intuiting) You okay? 
WIGAND'S VOICE (OVER) Sure. 
Lowell knows he isn't... 
LOWELL You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway. (beat) How are your kids handling the new house? 
INT. WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE AT NIGHT 
WIGAND Good. (beat) You have kids? 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) We have a couple.  One's hers, one's mine.  Everybody uses a different name. (wry) Modern marriage. (beat) How's Liane? 
WIGAND She's okay. 
He looks at Liane for beat.  We SEE his POV in medium shot. Then he moves and sits on the floor in the living room. 
WIGAND (CONT'D) Hold on a minute, Lowell... (after a beat) ...somebody...may be following me.  I don't know.  They came on the property... 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) What do you mean followed you?  Did you call the police? 
WIGAND I don't want to be paranoid...  I mean, maybe it's a game.  Some kind of mind game. 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) Well, what do you really think, though? 
WIGAND I don't know what the fuck I really think!  Are they doing it?  Is some crank doing it?  Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid?  Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know!  I don't fucking know. 
And it's quiet again. 
INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - LATE AT NIGHT 
Lowell sitting in bed on the phone, alarmed, sharing Wigand's fears. 
LOWELL Jeffrey, describe for me in detail what happened. 
INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE NIGHT 
And Jeffrey's emotions are back in check as... 
WIGAND Well, no, look...I mean, there was a footprint.  Forget it.  It's probably not important at all. (beat) You know, I got a job now.  I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry. (beat) So, what were you calling about? 
LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER) You called me. 
He takes another drink... 
WIGAND No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow.  So, what about? 
LOWELL (after a beat) Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did...I wanted to talk to you.  I wanted to hook up and talk to you.  About what we were talking about in your car.

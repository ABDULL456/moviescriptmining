Deckard hangs in Batty's hand like a bag of laundry. 
BATTY That was irrational of me -- not to mention unsportsmanlike.  Won't happen again. 
He drops him. 
BATTY I'll be down the hall when you're ready. 
Betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors. 
Deckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo- ment, then punches it with his fist. 
On his feet he's a little wobbly.  Holding his breath so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens.  No sound.  No sign of Batty.  The laser is laying nearby. He doesn't bother. 
Deckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can.  He had a job to do.  He would like to have done it, but he's not insane.  He gets to the landing and turns. 
On the first step down, he stops.  Batty's on the land- ing below, looking up at him. 
BATTY Where you going? 
He wait a moment for Deckard's answer. 
BATTY No cheating.  A promise is a promise.  I'll honor the handicapped, but we gotta play on the top floor.  You go get your laser gun now.  And I'll give you a few seconds before I come. 
Deckard turns back into the hall.  Batty smiles. 
Deckard's running down the corridor. 
BATTY'S VOICE One! 
Halfway down the hall he finds his laser. 
BATTY'S VOICE Two! 
Deckard darts into the nearest door.  The apartment above Sebastian's, with the hole in the floor.  Deckard considers it. 
BATTY'S VOICE No fair jumping through holes.  You might get hurt doing that!  THREE! 
Deckard dashes back into the hall, chooses another door and goes in. 
INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      109 
His eyes skim over everything, looking for an advantage. He throws open a door.  The bathroom.  The plumbing is dismantled, walls stripped, revealing brick, nails protruding.  Too small. 
INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      110 
Batty's coming up the steps. 
BATTY Five! 
INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      111 
Deckard's looking for a corner -- a place that covers the angles.  He chooses the far side of the room with a line to the door. 
INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           112 
Batty's coming down the center, listening at the doors. 
BATTY Six! 
INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT                      113 
Deckard's crouched in the corner and aimed.  He looks at his hand.  It's trembling. 
BATTY'S VOICE Seven! 
INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           114 
Batty's standing in front of a door, listening. 
BATTY Oh, I wonder where he is.  Not in here, I don't think.  Eight! 
He goes to the next door. 
BATTY Maybe here.  Doesn't sound like it.  Nine!

MITCH That's right. 
PHIL Then we die young. The others are uncertain, but Phil helps Slim up; Teddy joins him. Ginny tentatively follows his lead and picks up Gracie.. 
SLIM 
(VERY SOFT) (This is no good.) You're humiliating him. 
GINNY What? 
SLIM (a little louder) He'll come after me and kill me. Mitch overhears this, smiles. 
MITCH You hear that? That's why she loves me. (off their horrified looks) Nobody cares like I do. The others stare at him in astonishment, but continue toward the door. Mitch leans toward Slim, whispers: 
MITCH See you soon. 
CUT TO: 
INT. VAN. NIGHT. 
Gracie awake now in Slim's arms: staring, confused. Gentle rocking of the van. The others barely visible, like shadows. 
CHECK, PLEASE 
INT. AIRPLANE. DAY. 
Gracie asleep, Slim holding her. Blinds down, movie playing. Despite Gracie's age, the angle and soft lighting make this resemble a Madonna and child... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NAVY PIER (CHICAGO). EVENING. 
Open air market: shops, stalls; yuppie heaven. Slim carries Gracie on her shoulders. They're with Jog (her old boyfriend, from the wedding). Horsing around, having a good time, Gracie eating a pastry. They stop and look out at Lake Michigan. 
SLIM Wow ... whattaya think, Toots? 
GRACIE It's a big ocean! 
JOE Well. It's only a lake, but we like it. 
GRACIE (nods, stares out... Can we stay here a while? 
CUT TO: 
INT. JOE'S CAR. NIGHT. 
They're driving along, suddenly Joe says - 
JOE Coming up, whattaya say?! 
GRACIE & SLIM 
(A GAME) Bobbing for apples! Slim (front seat) and Gracie (back) both drop their heads so they can't be seen from outside the car - Joe turns the corner, presses a garage door opener, and drives into the basement garage of a nice-looking 4-plex. 
INT. JOE'S 4-PLEX. NIGHT. 
They come in from the garage, throw off their coats. All the curtains in the apartment are drawn. 
JOE Is there anybody who likes ice cream? Gracie whoops - The doorbell rings - 
Slim and Joe freeze - Slim whips her hand over Gracie's mouth - Gracie looks horrified: why are you covering my - Slim puts her finger to her mouth: shhh. She takes Gracie's hand; they scurry out of sight - Joe hurries to the stereo, puts it on. Music to cover Gracie's "whoop . " He goes to the door, looks through the peep hole. Sees a LARGE MAN IN A SUIT. 
JOE Yes?

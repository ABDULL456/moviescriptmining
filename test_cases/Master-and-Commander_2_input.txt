A hint of daylight to the east. The mist beginning to shift as an offshore breeze picks up. LEAD-MAN 90 fathoms, white shelly sand. 
CALAMY Four knots, Sir. 
BONDEN is still at the wheel.

JACK takes his advice and goes below again. 
19. - THE SHIP (TIMELAPSE) 
The sky a shade paler. A wind coming up. 
20.    ON THE STARBOARD GANGWAY - DAWN 
The lookout, VINCENT, peers into the mist. 
VINCENT Starboard gangway ahoy. 
HOLLOM, the oldest of the midshipmen, whose watch it now is, appears at his shoulder. 
HOLLOM What is it, Vincent? 
VINCENT I heard something. A bell. 
HOLLOM peers out into the fog, then turns. 
HOLLOM Native fisherman perhaps. (shouts) Mr. Calamy! 
Midshipman CALAMY comes running forward. 
HOLLOM (CONT'D) The lead, if you please. 
Young CALAMY takes the lead, scrambles into the chains at the bow of the ship and throws out the lead line. 
HOLLOM takes up a telescope and searches through the eddies of fog. Over HOLLOM's P.O.V. we can hear CALAMY sounding the depth. 
CALAMY (O.S.) Sixty fathoms, white sand! 
Hollom folds his telescope 
HOLLOM Well. It can't have been a reef marker. 
CALAMY, unconvinced, checks through his own telescope

24. COCKPIT, ORLOP DECK 
Rows of wicked-looking instruments are hastily thrown on the operating table by PADEEN, MATURIN's servant - saws, retractors and knives glistening in the lamp-light. 
DR. MATURIN hurries in blinking sleep out of his eyes as he ties on his black apron - behind him, HIGGINS, the assistant surgeon. 
25.   POWDER MAGAZINE 
Little ADDISON and his team of powder-monkeys run with their boxes of gunpowder to the... 
26. GUN-DECK 
As LAMB, NAGEL and the other carpenters bash down cabin partitions, transforming the entire gun-deck into a single continuous space, from the bows to the Captain's Great Cabin in the stern. 
As the crews swarm about their guns, grotesque shadows are thrown on the walls and ceiling by the numerous battle- lanterns arriving to illuminate the scene. 
27. WEATHER-DECK 
JACK and PULLINGS stride the length of the deck toward the bow [ ] . They pass crews manning the carronades while others swing the ship's small boats out and over the side to be towed behind the ship.

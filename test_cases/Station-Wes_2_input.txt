As Haven's wagon lumbers in. He looks curiously at the main office. No one is in sight, but as he draws nearer, the swarthy hard-faced man, Pete, comes out on to the porch. 
PETE Hey, you! 
Haven looks at him. 
PETE You see a rider comin' up? 
HAVEN Nope. 
PETE You sure? 
HAVEN Haven't even seen a lizard. Where do I put this stuff? 
PETE Where did you put it before? 
HAVEN I never did. I'm a new driver. I think it's grub. 
PETE Take it to the cook shack. 
Haven flicks the reins, moves on. Pete watches suspiciously. Haven moves on to the cook shack outside of which the cook is busy dumping a pail of slop. 
HAVEN (pulling up) You the cook? 
COOK Nah. I just wear this hat to keep the flies out of my hair. 
HAVEN It don't matter to me, brother. I just haul this grub. I'd just as soon haul it back. 
COOK Take it next door. 
Haven pulls up by the warehouse next door and gets down. There is nobody around, so he starts wrestling with the food crates himself, taking the first one into the warehouse. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 
It is big, barnlike, piled with provisions and equipment. Haven stares around; carries the crate to where a similar stack of crates are piled. Lowering the crate he notes a shiny object, picks it up. It is a button from an army uniform. He pockets it as his attention is distracted by two horsemen passing outside. Haven goes out to continue unloading. 
EXT. MAIN OFFICE - DAY 
As the two horsemen ride up to Pete and dismount. Ben and Sam are standing there. 
PETE (to the horsemen) Any luck? 
BEN No sign of Joe. But there's the tracks of another horse, circling the mill and coming back on the road just north. (he points) 
PETE That's bad. 
He glances toward the wagon where Haven is working. 
PETE Let's go and look at this guy again. 
The five men move down to Haven's wagon. 
ANGLE ON wagon and Haven, as he sees them come. His lip tightens; then he relaxes and goes on lifting a crate. He pauses as they come up and stand around him, their eyes fixed on: 
PETE You -- 
Haven looks at him. 
PETE You sure you didn't see no rider? 
HAVEN Look -- you want me to say I saw a rider? I'll say it. I'll say I saw a ghost. It don't make any difference to me. 
PETE When did you get this job? 
HAVEN Yesterday. 
PETE What for? 
HAVEN It's the system. If I don't work I don't eat. I never been able to find any way to beat it. 
PETE Who hired you? 
HAVEN (blandly) Mr. Haven. 
PETE The guy that had the fight? 
HAVEN Same fellow. 
It is a risky little moment; Haven eases both bruised hands into his coat pockets. 
PETE Friend of yours? 
HAVEN (innocently) Who? 
PETE This Haven. 
HAVEN Any man who gives me a job is my friend. Look, I'm working, I haul this stuff out here. Nobody wants to tell me where to dump it. Everybody wants to know what I'm doin' and what I haven't seen. I don't know. I get thirty cents an hour. How smart does that have to make me?

HATSUE Will you write that? 
Her voice is soft.  The difference is palpable. 
ISHMAEL I might just. 
His voice is kindness and friendship. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) I was part of her life again.  I was a person. 
EXT. COAST GUARD LIGHTHOUSE, POINT WHITE - DUSK 
A tower of reinforced concrete, rising a hundred feet above the sea.  Ishmael's hand in his pocket.  Trudging toward it. 
INT. LIGHTHOUSE RECORDS ROOM - DUSK 
Ishmael being led into a cramped room, stacked floor to ceiling with wooden crates, file cabinets, duffel bags.  Our host is LEVANT, a young Coast Guard radioman nearly six foot six, with a huge Adam's apple, and kinky black hair.  He gestures around the room at all the records.  Voila. 
ISHMAEL You have the night watch?  On the radio. 
LEVANT Since September.  Last guys got transferred. 
Ishmael looks around.  There is a lot of stuff. 
ISHMAEL And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em. 
LEVANT Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space. 
Ishmael nods.  Guess so. 
ISHMAEL All kinds of radio transmissions? Fisherman in trouble, and such. 
Innocent question.  Random example. 
LEVANT All kinds.  Make yourself at home. 
And leaves.  Ishmael looks at the task before him.  Then, out the window.  Dark now.  His reflection stares back.  As troubled as he is. 
INT. PETERSEN'S GROCERIES - DAY 
Ishmael at 24, carrying milk and crackers down the aisle of a grocery store, the empty sleeve of his mackinaw pinned up at the elbow.  He turns the corner to see... 
...three people in line at the register.  The second is Hatsue.  An infant carried at her shoulder. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) I'd been back two months.  It was the first time I'd seen her. 
He joins the line.  The CHECKER glances his way, then looks awkwardly down.  This makes the others turn.  And Hatsue's eyes. Meet his. 
HATSUE Hello. 
The voice, the face, are cool and formal.  There is no anger, no unkindness.  Only the absence of warmth.  Ishmael nods.  His face hard, stricken.  His heart pounds in his throat. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her. 
HATSUE I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor... 
ISHMAEL The Japs did it. 
No one knows where to look.  Down, away, anything.  But Hatsue never blinks. 
ISHMAEL They shot it off.  At Tarawa. 
She holds her ground, her eyes soften, somehow.  Somewhere between compassion and pity.  Her slender fingers stroke the baby at her shoulder. 
ISHMAEL I'm sorry, I'm sorry I said that. 
All the feeling comes to his eyes.  Everything he will never tell her.  A murmur... 
ISHMAEL I'm sorry about everything.  All of it. 
He drops his milk and crackers on the counter. 
And walks away. 
INT. LIGHTHOUSE RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT 
Ishmael sits alone.  Beyond the glass, a SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the sea, the snow-covered shore.  But Ishmael stares at a folder.  Open in his lap. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) September 16.  At 1:42 A.M., the dead of night.  The S.S. West Corona, a Greek-owned freighter, was lost. In heavy fog. 
His finger.  Traces a line of the report. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) They radioed to the lighthouse. They would have to dogleg, bisecting Ship Channel Bank.  And Seaman Philip Milholland wrote that down.  In his report. 
Ishmael closes his eyes. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) Carl Heine drowned.  In Ship Channel Bank.  And his watch stopped.  At 1:47. 
He looks out through the glass.  As if he could watch it happen. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) A huge freighter plowing through. Throwing a wake big enough to fling any man overboard. 
And Ishmael removes the page from the file.  Slowly, he folds it into quarters.  Slides it into his coat pocket. 
ISHMAEL (calls out) Seaman...? 
And closes the file.  Slips it back into the cabinet.  Levant appears, vaguely irritated by the summons.  So Ishmael smiles. Sorry, nothing important. 
ISHMAEL How long you have this detail? 
LEVANT Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16. 
Ishmael's face.  Just to clarify... 
ISHMAEL You mean, early morning the 16th? 
LEVANT No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland. 
Oh.  Ishmael nods. 
LEVANT They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.

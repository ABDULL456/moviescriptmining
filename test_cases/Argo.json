U.S. EMBASSY (TEHRAN) - MORNING 1 \nEffigies of Jimmy Carter and the deposed Shah -- crowds chanting Magbar Carter! Magbar Ahmrika!\u009d Fists in the air. \nSUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - NOVEMBER 4, 1979 YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full chador. Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of Ayatollah Khomeini. PASTED TO ROOSEVELT GATE: photographs of STUDENTS who were killed under the deposed Shah of Iran's regime. Signs in English: U.S.A. RETURN THE SHAH\u009d -- JUSTICE FOR MURDER.\u009d A few IRANIAN POLICE attend -- more as bystanders than peacekeepers. A MAN frantically stabs an EFFIGY of the SHAH. An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera. \n2 EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 2 \nFrom INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of the protest. There are three primary buildings on campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE.

As if on cue, the IRANIAN POLICE move from the gates. A WOMAN removes a large pair of bolt cutters from underneath her chador -- hands them to a BEARDED STUDENT -- who gets to work on the CHAINS holding the gate \nCLOSED -- When one YOUNG MAN wearing a green military field jacket raises his fist, we can see that he has a concealed PISTOL in his clothes.

This is REZA, mid- 20s, a low-level administrator in the Ministry of Guidance. Mendez gets out and they speak and shake hands. The image FREEZES. In a BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH. They exchange pleasantries and Reza leads them down a narrow street toward the bazaar. \n209 EXT./INT. TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY 209 \nReza is leading Mendez and the group of Houseguests through the Tehran Bazaar. A word about the place: the world's largest bazaar. 10 kilometers of narrow alleys. Chinese-made Swiss watches, banks, mosques, butchers, fabric stores, gold stands. Boys with hand-trucks loaded down with piles of fabric cut through the crowd. Older Islamic architecture elbows up against neon signs and rickety wooden stands with second-story balconies like Bourbon Street. Bob Anders walks toward the front. \nREZA You are the director? \nBOB ANDERS Yes. \nREZA \n(PLEASANT) Is this film a foreign bride film? \nBOB ANDERS I'm sorry? \nREZA A film where a foreign bride is brought to Iran, but she dsn't understand the language and customs and there are misunderstandings and laughs. \nBOB ANDERS No. \n(CONTINUED) \nARGO - Final 82. \n209 CONTINUED: 209 \nREZA (not happy with that) Mmmm.

Then of CORA LIJEK, who walks through the bazaar with an open ARGO SCRIPT in her hand. The Revolutionary Guard photographer is taking pictures of each of the Houseguests, picking their portraits off one by one like a sniper. \n210 EXT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE (TEHRAN) - DAY 210 \nTwo sedans turn onto the property and head up the driveway. Ali Khalkali, the revolutionary official, gets out of one of the cars.

TEHRAN BAZAAR - DAY 212 \nReza leads Mendez and the Houseguests deeper into this city within a city; fundamentalist ground zero. BAZAARIS stand at their shop doors; puzzled; unfriendly; watching the visitors. Kathy Stafford, the production designer on the scout, takes a Polaroid of a window adorned in gold. The SHOPKEEPER, a 70-ish bazaari, sees her do so. He hurries out of his store, speaking in rapid-fire Farsi at her. The Houseguests stop. Reza speaks to the Shopkeeper. \nREZA \n(TO KATHY) He wants the photograph you took. \nMENDEZ She's the production designer. Her job is to take photographs. SHOPKEEPER getting more and more heated in Farsi. \nREZA He says he did not give you permission to take a photograph of his store. Other BAZAARIS and SHOPPERS are starting to gather.

On a street where a five-year-old boy, in the care of his eight-year-old brother, watches a pickup truck of armed komiteh speed past. \n224B INT. CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT 224B \nMendez holds a passport and some papers in front of Bob Anders' face. It feels late. The Houseguests are tired, sweating, sitting around a dining room. Mendez, sleeves rolled up, drilling them. The ARGO STORYBOARDS are scattered around the room. \nMENDEZ Where was your passport issued? Bob Anders dsn't know. ANGLES ON the Houseguests. \nANDERS Vancouver. \nMENDEZ Where were you born? \nBOB ANDERS Toronto. \nMENDEZ Toronno like piranha.

He looks down to consult the paper in front of him, but before he can, Mendez pulls the paper. \nMENDEZ He's an American spy. Shoot him. A beat on Stafford, frustrated -- \nMENDEZ They'll try to break you by getting you agitated. You need to know your r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 so well that you don't flinch. \nJ STAFFORD (nearly defeated, \nLOOKING AWAY) You think your little story will matter when there's guns to our heads? \nMENDEZ My story's the only thing between you and the gun to your head. A beat. Mendez puts the r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 back in front of Stafford. Kathy looks at her husband: he just isn't good at this. \n(CONTINUED) \nARGO - Final 89. \n224B CONTINUED: (2) 224B \nMENDEZ Let's go again. \n224C INT.

Who then opens his accordion folder and takes from it the ARGO STORYBOARDS. J Stafford spreads them out on the table. Three other Komiteh in the room lean forward, their AUTOMATIC WEAPONS at their sides, and look at the STORYBOARD DRAWINGS. The Persian Empire futurism of Jack Kirby's drawings. \nJ STAFFORD \n(FARSI) These are the villains. Y'see these guys here? And these are the hers... in the spice market...

We see the AZADI MONUMENT out his window. \nANGLES OUT HIS WINDOWS The Ayatollah looks down from everywhere. \n(CONTINUED) \nARGO - Final 66. \n174 CONTINUED: 174 A MAN IS HANGING FROM A CRANE. People mill underneath. Women in chadors at Kentucky Fried Chicken. An ARMED GANG in the back of pickup truck pulls up near his taxi. We see PROPAGANDA painted on a wall/window. \n175 INT. TAXI/EXT. MINISTRY - DAY 175 \nThe taxi pulls up to a FORMAL, PINK BUILDING. The Driver stops. They've arrived. \n176 INT. MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND ISLAMIC GUIDANCE - DAY 176 \nMEHDI BEHROUZ, 33, is the newly appointed Deputy Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance. Like many of the stars of the Revolution, he was educated in the U.S. Right now he's looking at the ARGO script. \nBEHROUZ This film crew is just yourself? \nMENDEZ Six more are joining me today. They're coming from Canada. \nBEHROUZ You'd like to film at the bazaar? \nMENDEZ The bazaar, maybe the palace. \nBEHROUZ \n(NOT PARTICULARLY \nFRIENDLY) I see. The exotic Orient. Snake charmers and flying carpets. \n(A BEAT) You come to us at a complicated time. Before the Revolution, 40 percent of the movie theaters in Tehran were showing pornography. Our function is purification as well as promotion of the arts. \n(TAKES SCRIPT) I'll review for the Minister. \nARGO - Final 67. \n177 EXT. CANADIAN EMBASSY - DAY 177 \nA TAXI pulls away. Mendez, carrying his luggage, stands at a wrought iron gate with MAPLE LEAVES worked into the iron. Ken Taylor comes out of the building, opens the gate himself. \nMENDEZ Mr. Ambassador. \nTAYLOR Ken Taylor. He shakes Tony's hand and they start to walk to Taylor's car. \nTAYLOR I was expecting more of a G-Man look. \nMENDEZ You're thinking of FBI, sir. They get into the car. \n178 INT. TAYLOR'S CAR - OUTSIDE EMBASSY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 178 \nTaylor gives Tony SIX BLANK CANADIAN PASSPORTS. \nTAYLOR These are blank, y'know. The stamps? \nMENDEZ I'll take care of that. \nTAYLOR How long? \nMENDEZ A day to prep them with their cover stories. Two if they need it. \nTAYLOR And you'll fly out with them? Tony nods. A distant sound of a crowd outside. \n(CONTINUED) \nARGO - Final 68. \n178 CONTINUED: 178 \nTAYLOR There's something you should know. We think one of our housekeepers figured out who they are. We don't know if we can trust her. Now the noise outside is louder. Taylor turns to the window. Tony joins him. \nTAYLOR So sooner is better. They stand listening to the demonstration sounds, echoing over the rooftops of the city. \n179 OMITTED 179 \n"}

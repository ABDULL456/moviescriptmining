152   INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      152 
QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers pulling away from Sam. Shocked. Like he's seen a ghost. 
SAM What's wrong, Charlie?

153   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING                              153 
Sam starts the truck. Charlie wants to scream for her to stop. But he's frozen. She drives away. He watches her go. The truck gets smaller in the distance until it turns at the stop sign. And disappears. Charlie stands there, alone.

QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers the night with Sam. We see her put her hand on his knee. The image moves up the arm. To the shoulder. To the face. And we reveal, we are not in Sam's bedroom. And it is not Sam touching Charlie. But... 
Aunt Helen 
AUNT HELEN Don't wake your sister. 
BACK TO REALITY: 
155   EXT. SAM AND PATRICK'S HOUSE - MORNING                              155 
The memory only registers as a small blink of his eye. Charlie sees his friends are crying. He's not. He's numb. 
156   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING                                      156 
Charlie walks down the street. His eyes far away. The images and memories are short, violent bursts. If you've never had an anxiety attack, this is how it feels. 
157   EXT. CHARLIE'S STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                           157 
QUICK FLASH. It's Christmas Eve.       Aunt Helen smiles to Little Charlie. 
AUNT HELEN It'll be our little secret, okay? 
Little Charlie nods. 
158   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING (PRESENT)                            158 
BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie walks toward us on the sidewalk. We see him through a long lens. His image fractures. We see him in different planes of the image. He's beginning to break apart. One image. Two images. 
159   INT. CHARLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                   159 
QUICK FLASH. Little Candace is asleep on the floor.     Aunt Helen sits next to Little Charlie on the sofa. 
AUNT HELEN Look, Charlie. She's fast asleep. 
160   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING (PRESENT)                         160 
BACK TO PRESENT. We see Charlie fracturing. The pieces scattered. Out of focus. Lost. He's all over the frame. 
161   INT. CHARLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                   161 
QUICK FLASH.   Aunt Helen points to Little Candace. 
AUNT HELEN Don't wake your sister.

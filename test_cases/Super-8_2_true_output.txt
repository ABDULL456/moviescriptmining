Tally puts a MAP on his desk -- 28 DOTS in a CIRCLE, anywhere from a 20 to 150 MILE RADIUS, WITH LILLIAN AT THE CENTER. 
OFFICER TALLY (CONT'D) It's like they all just... ran away, every direction... 
Jack is stunned. 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Officer Rosko at his desk, with a YOUNG WOMAN, a HAM RADIO at his desk beside a REEL-TO-REEL TAPE DECK. He takes notes: 
YOUNG WOMAN It's not her. She never's disappeared before. 
OFFICER ROSKO Alright. Now what does she look like? 
YOUNG WOMAN She's got dark hair, it was in rollers. Do you know what rollers are? 
OFFICER ROSKO Yes, I know what rollers are. 
YOUNG WOMAN She went to her car-- 
Suddenly a GARBLED ELECTRONIC SOUND from the HAM RADIO. Rosko quickly hits RECORD on the reel-to-reel -- 
OFFICER ROSKO EXCUSE ME-- 
He grabs speaker, turns the volume knob, puts the speaker close to the tape recorder, turns on recorder. 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
FOUR OFFICERS gather as Jack PLAYS BACK THE REEL-TO-REEL through Milner's DESCRAMBLER. He WRITES DOWN AS THEY LISTEN TO MEN'S VOICES, creepily FILTERED and BROKEN UP:

EXT. WOODWARD'S HOUSE - DAY 
MILITARY VEHICLES parked everywhere. Personnel removing boxes from the house, packing it all up. But out front, Joe is dressed as an Airman, performing with Martin, dressed as the detective. 
Military trucks surround the house. Hathaway is with a SOLDIER: 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY I came as soon as I could, what's happening here? 
OFFICER JOE Military police investigation. It was a suicide. 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY Suicide? Who was it? 
OFFICER JOE A former Air Force officer. He called me last night, said he had a secret that he couldn't keep any longer. 
Officer Joe hands Hathaway a FILE. Hathaway looks at it. 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY What's this? 
OFFICER JOE He worked at Romero Chemical. He found out some things the company's been doing. After what you told me at the bar, I thought you should know. 
Cary behind the camera, Charles beside him: 
CARY (QUIETLY) Are we gonna get in trouble here--? 
CHARLES (WHISPER-YELL) Shhhh! Production value! It's for the movie! 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY This proves it. They knew, the company knew. Thank you so much for the information. 
OFFICER JOE We just made the discovery ourselves. You understand this is top secret. 
DETECTIVE HATHAWAY Of course. 
OFFICER JOE I would never have given you this information if you and I hadn't served together in Vietnam. 
As it continues, we see Alice behind the camera, watching Joe, smiling. But then she sees something that disturbs her: Jack's CRUISER pulls up. 
INT. WOODWARD'S HOUSE - DAY 
A dozen OFFICERS go through HUNDREDS OF CARDBOARD BOXES of documents. Books and personal belongings are put into boxes, taken from the house. Overmyer enters, crosses to Nelec, who reviews a folder. 
OVERMYER Nothing so far-- 
NELEC How much more is there?

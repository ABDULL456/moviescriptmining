TACTICAL COMMANDER Say we drop in a light weight tac team outside the city. 
BILL You get through the checkpoints and roadblocks. You show up in my bedroom in the dead of the night with an armed tac team ask me to help out Uncle Sam? I'm going to react unpredictably. 
TACTICAL COMMANDER What about forcible extraction of two or three of the main targets? 
VALERIE No. We've got 29 names. I want to get to them all. 
TACTICAL     COMMANDER How? You can't use     the inspectors. You can't use tac.     The wall's too high Val. What are     you going to do. Train a mouse? 
VALERIE Maybe. 
INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
Joe opens his eyes. Rolls across. He's alone. 
INT. KITCHEN, THE WILSON HOME. NIGHT 
Joe comes downstairs...Valerie is by the front door, dressed, cinched black mack, suitcase. 
VALERIE Hey, did I wake you up? 
JOE It's three forty five.. 
VALERIE I gotta go. I have to be at the airport in forty five minutes. 
Joe, still half-asleep, catches up. 
JOE Well...how long this time? I mean... Do we need childcare for tomorrow- 
VALERIE I left a post-it by the lamp. Its all on the post-it. 
JOE Right. Its on the post-it. 
VALERIE I didn't want to wake you. (Senses something) Are you OK? 
JOE We've been leaving post-its for each other for months now.. we talk via Post-It. That fridge is like a dead letter drop. (Stops. Laughs) Jesus. Listen to me!. I sound like an old... Some- (He bangs the door) I don't know where you go. Who you meet. If you're in some jail, or lying in some ditch in Jordan, Beirut. And if you go missing, I can't tell anyone because you were never there. I'd never know what happened. I don't know where you go. 
VALERIE I'm going to Cleveland. 
He stops. Thunder-robbed. 
VALERIE I'll be home tonight. (Then) It's on the Post-It. 
She kisses him. They look at one another. 
JOE Have a nice day. 
She shuts the door, leaving Joe alone. He walks through to the kitchen, looks at the fridge, one by one he takes all the notes off, then, deliberately, drops them in the bin. 
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM, EUCLID CLINIC, CLEVELAND. DAY 
A busy ER. A female doctor shakes hands with grateful parents. She bends down to talk to a boy, cast on his arm. 
VALERIE watches from a distance. 
EXT. SUBURBAN HOME, MORELAND HILLS, CLEVELAND. DAY 
A car park. The female doctor gets out of her car, with grocery bags, and goes toward her house. 
ACROSS THE STREET -- VALERIE watches from a parked rental. 
CUT TO: 
As the doctor finds the right key, she suddenly turns to see-- 
VALERIE Dr. Al Haddad? Is there somewhere we can speak? 
INT. STARBUCKS, SHOPPING MALL, SUBURBS OF CLEVELAND. NIGHT 
In the foreground some goth kids play with their ipods. In the window, Valerie and Dr. Sawsan Al Haddad sip coffee. 
VALERIE How long is it since you saw your brother? 
SAWSAN 1989. I attended a medical convention over there. Before that, in `83, he came here for an engineering conference. Twice in twenty five years. We try to stay in contact. It's difficult. 
VALERIE Would you like to go back and see him? 
SAWSAN holds her gaze. 
SAWSAN You want me to become a spy.

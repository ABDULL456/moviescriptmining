DAPHNE I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore. 
JORDY I know. 
DAPHNE You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison? 
JORDY They're not gonna send you right back. 
DAPHNE I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone... 
He covers her with the towel, pulling her up. 
JORDY You can trust me. 
She embraces him.  Trusting him.  He stands there for a moment.  Then awkwardly holds her.  Comforting her. INT. NYC RESTAURANT - DAY 
CLOSE UP 
on a steak.  Male hands cut a piece.  Another male hand sets down a huge bottle of Extra Strength Excedrin.  The hands abandon the steak and rip open the bottle.  The CAMERA pulls back to include the LCD screen of Oleg's videocamera.  He is taping Emil as he rips open the safety plastic with his teeth.  Emil is sweating with fever and his eyes are glazed over in pain.  He 'drinks' pills from the bottle and chews them up.  Wincing in pain.  Emil washes them down with a beer. 
Emil looks down and the camera follows his gaze to the "People" magazine article he's reading on Stephen Geller. Emil laughs.  Shaking his head at the article as the videocamera tilts back up to his face. 
OLEG What is it? 
EMIL The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it. 
OLEG I did. 
EMIL And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry. 
OLEG Why not? 
EMIL Put the camera down, Oleg. 
Oleg closes the LCD screen and puts the camera down.  Emil removes a small address book -- from Leon's wallet - he looks up Eddie Flemming's name. 
OLEG What is that? 
EMIL What does it look like?  It's an address book! 
Oleg jumps up with the camera to tape the book. 
OLEG Let me get a shot of it. 
EMIL Sit down! 
OLEG This way.  Hold it this way.  Good. 
Oleg gets a shot and quickly sits back down. 
OLEG (CONT'D) Why won't you be angry at me for keeping my movie? 
Emil takes a gulp of beer - drops cash on the table and limps away.  Oleg follows. 
INT. PRECINCT - DAY 
It's quiet - Chief Duffy paces in front of the Sergeant's desk.  Looking at his watch.  Growing more and more aggravated as every second ticks by.  Jordy enters escorting Daphne.  Sees Duffy and tires to go past him.  Duffy turns and sees Jordy and Daphne. 
DUFFY Hey.  Warsaw. 
Jordy stops and comes back.  Sitting Daphne down on a bench. 
JORDY Hey, Chief, what are you doing here? 
DUFFY I came to see how the investigation was going. (looks at Daphne) I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?! 
Jordy takes a few steps away from Daphne. 
JORDY Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up. 
DUFFY What do you mean, 'cleaned up?' 
JORDY I let her take a shower. 
DUFFY A shower!?  Did you take one, too? 
JORDY No!  Nothing happened. 
DUFFY Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!

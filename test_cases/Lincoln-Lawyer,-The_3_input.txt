(YIELDS) Alright I'll go quietly. But after today's hearing, if you don't object. 
MICK Depends. You going for no-bail? 
MAGGIE That won't change with the prosecutor. Not with what your guy did. With which she shows him the photo: gruesome. 
MICK If he did it. 
MAGGIE Sure. "If." They only picked him up in her home with blood all over him, but it's a valid question... 
MICK I love it when you're sarcastic. Can I at least see the arrest report? 
MAGGIE Get it from whoever takes over. No favors on this one. 
Mick looks admiringly at Maggie. At her passion. 
MICK How's Hayley? A beat. Off the sudden shift in topic, Maggie starts putting away the things on her desk... 
MAGGIE She's good. She likes the things you send her but would rather you show up yourself... 
MICK How about this weekend? This takes her by surprise. But she takes him up on it. 
MAGGIE Okay, I'll tell Hayley. Tonight. Only Mick-- don't cancel on her. 
CUT TO, INT. COURTROOM - LATER 
A TV CAMERA is trained toward LOUIS in the HOLDING AREA, he tries avoiding it... while MICK AND MAGGIE are ARGUING IN 
FRONT OF THE JUDGE... 
MICK Judge, there is no way the state can claim my client is a flight 
RISK-- 
MAGGIE With resources like this man has, it's always a risk-- let alone the fact that the victim was brutally 
ASSAULTED-- 
JUDGE Ms. McPherson, the extent of her injuries are not the point. I'm setting bail at a million dollars... Mick wins, Maggie loses. Exchange glances-- 
WE'RE-- INT. DOORS TO THE COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Mick bangs out, always moving. Getting the door for him is his friend, bail bondsman "VAL" VALENZUELA, excited-- 
VAL What'd I tell you, Mick, we got us a franchise... 
MICK We'll see, Val... 
VAL There's the lawyer-guy, you get him to go for the cash-bond... MOVING from Val, Mick HEADS DOWN THE HALL, through the BUSY CRUSH of attorneys, clients, spectators to-- DOBBS, waiting. 
MICK Cecil Dobbs? 
DOBBS Mr. Haller. (They shake hands.) It was depressing to see the boy caught up in that cattle call... 
MICK Boy? 
DOBBS I've represented the family so long I think of Louis that way. 
MICK He did look a little frail. My advice is, let Mr. Valenzuela fix you up with a bond and take "the boy" home. 
DOBBS A bond? But Mrs. Windsor was thinking of putting up property... 
MICK No good. Assessing it will take days. By then Louis might be carrying somebody's child. (before Dobbs can argue) So just tap Val for the bond, spring Louis, and take him to your office. We'll meet there at Four. And heads off again. Dobbs follows him out, to... 
EXT. VAN NUYS COURTHOUSE, DAY - MICK AND DOBBS 
Sunlight. Where Dobbs suddenly TENSES as he SEES: A TV CAMERAMAN coming out with camera. Off Dobbs's reaction-- 
MICK Yep. Media's already picked us up. 
DOBBS Mrs. Windsor's sensitive about the press... Mick, a beat. Then calls the cameraman over. When he comes-- 
MICK I saw you in there filming. What's your name? 
CAMERAMAN Rob Gillen. They call me "Sticks." 
MICK You freelancing on this, Sticks?

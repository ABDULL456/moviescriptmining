Richmond carries a vodka bottle and two tumblers.     He fills them, gives one to her. 
They touch glasses.    Down the hatch.   Tight laughter. 
He looks at her. 
She looks at him.    There's a lot of sexual tension in the air. 
But now he begins looking around, checking things out. She spots this. 
CHRISTY (drunk) It's okay -- I told him I was sick -- anyway, he's gone -- relax... 
He nods then, more at ease.    And he blows her a kiss. 
She catches it -- and now she starts to parade for him. Her body moving very slowly. 
He pours himself another shot, chugs it, watches.     Now -- 
40   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                      40 
Luther suddenly terrified and we find out why. 
41   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                             41 
Christy, fumbling with her necklace, looks across the room -- 
What she's looking at:     the side table with the remote that opens the vault. 
42   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                      42 
Luther, frozen, as Christy starts toward the table. 
43   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                             43 
The table and the remote waiting there. 
44   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                      44 
Luther, mouth dry...

Richmond, reaching out for her, then as she passes him; he takes her by the hand -- 
-- and now they are dancing, their bodies pressed together. They move slowly. She hums. He tries to get fancy, spin her with one arm -- 
-- no good. They're too drunk for it, starts to lose balance, separate. 
They giggle. Smile at each other. Now Christy manages to unhook her necklace, and as she starts to drop it in           * the drawer of the nightstand --                                   * 
46    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  46 
Luther.   A genuine sigh of relief -- 
-- which suddenly dies -- 
47    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         47 
Christy, as she spins toward the table again, still with the necklace in her hand. 
48    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  48 
Luther, and there's nothing he can do now but watch. 
49    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         49 
Richmond, watching too, emptying the vodka bottle into his tumbler, chugging it down and now... 
The table as Christy reaches out, grabs a remote, turns. 
50    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  50 
Luther dead in the water because -- 
51    CHRISTY'S                                                    51 
pointing the goddam thing at him -- 
-- and as she CLICKS it -- 
)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                        14. 
52    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                52 
Luther, and for a moment, he's like a goddam deer caught in the headlights -- 
-- but now here comes another sigh of relief and we find out why. 
53    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                       53 
Suddenly there's ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING -- she's turned the STEREO ON. Christy starts humming, replaces the clicker, drops the necklace in the drawer.                      * 
Then they are into each other's arms. Their bodies press. Their bodies sway. He moves a hand to her breasts -- 
-- Christy breaks loose, shakes a finger at him, as if to say, "naughty, naughty" -- 
-- then with one hand, she pulls a zipper down. The dress falls off her body. Her breasts spring free. She is wearing only her panties now and high heels. And a smile. 
She is stunning looking and she knows it and men have always gone nuts over her and she knows that too. And Richmond can't resist her either, goes to her, bends her back, caresses her neck, begins sucking her nipples. Christy moans. 
54    INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                54 
Luther, in the chair, embarrassed, averting his eyes. 
But the MOANING from the other room GROWS LOUDER, more insistent. 
55    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                       55 
Christy, pulling away for a moment, starting to work at Richmond's tie, shakes him out of his suit jacket, reaches for his belt, loosens it. She is working at his shirt buttons now and their breathing is audible and in a moment he is down to his boxer shorts and then her panties are off, her shoes kicked away and they are near the vault mirror now. As they approach it, they stare at themselves.

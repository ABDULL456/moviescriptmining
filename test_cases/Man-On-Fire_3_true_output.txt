A condescending smile as Jordan awaits his answer. 
CREASY I wasn't hired to guard Mr. Ramos. 
JORDAN For Pinta then? 
LISA Jordan! 
CREASY If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier. 
JORDAN What kind of an answer is that? 
CREASY The answer is the truth.   The question is foolish. 
Lisa smiles at the answer, kisses Jordan on the cheek.

LISA Jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch. I promise not to let Evelyn spend too much. 
Evelyn doesn't see it, but Creasy does. Jordan just lets his fingers trace the top of Lisa's ass. 
As she and Evelyn head for the car, Creasy is there to open the door. 
MERCEDES 
Creasy gets behind the wheel. Pulls into traffic. As he goes, he checks the rear view mirror. Jordan remains standing on the curb watching the car pull away. Something odd about it all. 
EXT.   PUBLIC POOL - MEXICO CITY - DAY 
Loud. Chaotic. Reminiscent     of a lunatic asylum. Creasy arrives at the public pool.    A practice. Several bodyguards gather at one end   of the pool. Give Creasy a less than friendly look. As    he looks for Pinta... 
A GUN goes off. 
Sees: The smoke from the starting pistol as the SWIMMERS splash into the water. 
He sees Pinta in the pool. The fifty yard dash. She's in fifth. Then fourth. Creasy walks along beside her. Third. Second and closing. And at the wall, still second. 
She surfaces, frustrated.    As she sees Creasy there... 
INT.   MERCEDES - DAY 
Creasy drives. Pinta in back, writing in her notebook. Not speaking, but a weird sort of harmony. Finally. 
CREASY You're fast. 
PINTA Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late. 
She keeps writing.   The number "2" over and over.

INT.   CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Creasy sits in his chair drinking scotch.     All alone needless to say. 
Creasy takes the instructional VHS on bodyguards that Rayburn gave him and plugs it into the VCR. It's in Japanese. Shakes his head. He switches off the VCR and surfs the TV channels instead. Sees talk show with the editor of REFORMA newspaper, ROSANNA GUERRERO, talking about organized crime in Mexico. 
From out the window, a CAW, then again.     Yet again. 
Finally, Creasy stands goes to the window. He leans out, sees Pinta's window across the lawn from him. 
Pinta standing on the terrace. Another CAW. 
Creasy decides to play.    He CAWS in return. 
Pinta looks around.    Creasy does a pretty good impersonation. 
Hears Pinta CAW again. 
CREASY Hey... Pinta... 
She looks up at him. 
CREASY What are you doing? 
PINTA Calling for Emilio's macaw.    I thought I heard him. 
CREASY Do you think he'll come back? 
PINTA Maybe.    Did you hear him? 
CREASY No. 
PINTA How do you think he got out? 
CREASY (a beat) Well, I let him go. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     38. 
PINTA It's better to be free, right? 
CREASY Yes.   Actually, he was driving me crazy. 
Creasy disappears back inside. Pinta smiles big before letting the stick drop to the ground. 
PINTA I got you to talk, Creasy bear. 
Blue Bayou plays.   Pinta now listens to Creasy's sound. 
RONSTADT "...I'm so lonesome all the time, since I left my baby behind, on Blue Bayou." 
EXT.   RAMOS VILLA - DAY 
A DRIVER gets Samuel's and Lisa's luggage into a car. They're on their way, kissing Pinta goodbye. 
LISA I'll call you from Detroit, baby.

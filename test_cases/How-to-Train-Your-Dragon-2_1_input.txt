Drago breaks his fall, landing heavily upon the Bewilderbeast's tusk... 
As Hiccup tucks in his arms, trying to close the gap between he and Toothless before they both make impact with the ocean. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Almost there, buddy. Almost there! 
Hiccup reaches Toothless. They pair up, mid-air, and skyrocket past Drago as he hobbles to the top of the alpha's head. 
EXT. BERK - VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER 
(Scene 2500 - One True Alpha) 
Hiccup looks back at Drago, now issuing commands from the top of the Bewilderbeast's head. 
DRAGO Do something! 
HICCUP We need to get those two apart. 
Hiccup flies Toothless past a flag pole tears a strip of the flag. 
The Bewilderbeast BLASTS in their direction, barely missing them as they disappear around the back of a mountain. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) We gotta block him out, Toothless. Do you trust me, bud? 
Toothless coos, allowing Hiccup to BLINDFOLD him with the flag. Hiccup calms him with a touch. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) We can do this. You and me. As one. 
Hiccup SPLAYS Toothless' mechanical tail. Toothless responds, MATCHING the move with the natural half. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) That's it. Now let's try this one more time! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 90. 
They PEEL around the other side of the mountain, heading back toward Drago and Bewilderbeast, passing Astrid and the cheering Vikings on the ground. 
ASTRID Take them down, babe! 
The Viking roar in support as Hiccup and Toothless race past. 
Valka watches with pride as her son hurtles towards Drago and the alpha. 
VALKA Go get `em. 
DRAGO Take control of it! 
The Bewilderbeast's HISS becomes a furious ROAR, but to no avail. Hiccup clamps his hands over Toothless' ear plates, muffling the alpha's commands. 
HICCUP Shut it out, Toothless! 
DRAGO 
STOP THEM! 
The Bewilderbeast BLASTS! 
HICCUP 
NOW! 
Toothless suddenly PULLS UP, ARCING over Drago's head! Drago LAUGHS, victorious, then pauses in shock. 
DRAGO'S POV: as Toothless climbs inverted through the sky, the blindfold falls free, revealing an EMPTY SADDLE. 
Drago WHIRLS around, wide-eyed, to see... 
HICCUP ZOOMING TOWARD HIM, his wing-suit deployed, and his Dragon Blade trailing Zippleback gas. Drago SWIPES but misses him. Hiccup clicks the lighter and ignites the gas, blasting Drago off his Bewilderbeast with a SCREAM. 
Drago PLUMMETS, BREAKING HIS FALL against the massive dragon's spines and landing hard on the ground, his bullhook landing just out of reach. 
The Bewilderbeast WHIPS its tail, trying to SWAT down Hiccup. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 91. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Not again. 
(BEAT) 
TOOTHLESS! IT'S NOW OR NEVER! 
Toothless pops open his dorsal blades, arcs skyward, and rejoins Hiccup just before colliding with the alpha's tail.

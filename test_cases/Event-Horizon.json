{"train": "\"EVENT HORIZON\" \nScreenplay by \nPhilip Eisner \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nEXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL INTERPLANETARY SPACE \nA vast field of stars. The gas giant Neptune slowly spins into view. Brilliant and blue and cold against the void. \nEXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL A BLACK SILHOUETTE \nstands out against the planet, tiny against Neptune's scale. \nEXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL DRIFT CLOSER \nto discern the hard angles of a man-made craft. A ship. No longer dwarfed by the planet, the scale of the vessel emerges: a vast labyrinth of steel. \nIts shadow swallows all in darkness. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY \nShafts of Neptune's blue light enter through windows, illuminate debris suspended in the zero-gravity environment: shards of metal and glass. \nMOVE from the Corridor into: \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE \nA cockpit for three. Neptune's blue light fills the chamber, reflects off immobile particles in the air. Thick quartz windows look down at Neptune. The cockpit lights are dark but for one blinking red light. \nAn emergency beacon. Under-floor lights go on. \nThe strobe of the red light reveals a man floating at the helm, slowly spinning. He is dead, perfectly preserved in the cold vacuum of space. His eyes are empty black pits and his mouth hangs open in a scream: DR. WILLIAM WEIR. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STUDIO APARTMENT \nWeir opens his eyes, waking from dream. Sweat beads his ascetic, etched face. Many years a scientist. \nHe turns on the bedside lamp, revealing a couple's apartment. Decorated by a woman, but Weir is alone, unless you count photographs. His nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful woman. \nWeir reaches to the stand. Picks up... \nRECENT, UNFRAMED PHOTO \nThe woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave smile. \nWeir lies back on the bed. Looks at the photo. Presses it to his forehead and closes his eyes. Trying to be with her, just one more time. \nWEIR (whisper) I miss you. \nINT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER \nWeir stands in front of the bathroom mirror, shaving with a straight-razor. The mirror reveals the bathtub just behind him. DRIP, DRIP, DRIP... \nWeir turns to stare at the bathtub. Water wells up at the mouth of the tub's faucet, grows impossibly large, falls... DRIP. \nWeir turns back to his shaving. \nINT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER \nWeir stands in the kitchenette, staring at the microwave as it cooks his breakfast. \nINT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER \nWeir stands before his window, chewing his oatmeal mechanically, forcing himself to swallow. He reaches out to open the blinds... \nINT. STUDIO APARTMENT REVERSE ANGLE \nas the blinds pull aside, revealing Weir, upside-down. \nROTATE AND PULL BACK... \nEXT. DAYLIGHT STATION - MODEL TO REVEAL DAYLIGHT STATION \nWeir's window is just one of many in a space station, a delicate combination of cylindrical habitats and solar panels. The structure hangs above the Earth in low orbit. \nTITLE CARD: DAYLIGHT SPACE STATION 08.23.2046 \nINT. STUDIO APARTMENT (BLINDS OPEN) \nA videophone RINGS OS... \nWEIR (V.O.) This is Weir. \nLYLE (V.O.) (tinny) Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DAYLIGHT - OFFICE \nA military office, United States Aerospace Command seal blazoned on the door. Views of the Earth. Admiral HOLLIS sits behind his desk, a gruff career officer and a good man. \nWeir enters, escorted by Hollis' adjutant, LYLE. \nSMITH I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women... \nSTARCK Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own. \nThe captain's chair drops from above, swivels to reveal MILLER (male, Captain, intense). \nMILLER I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in? \nSMITH Locked and cocked. \nSTARCK We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready. \nMILLER Justin? \nBelow: the bridge's \"war-room\" -- ship's systems and mission stations. JUSTIN (male, Engineer, young hot-shot). \nJUSTIN Everything green on my boards, Skipper. \nMILLER Start the countdown. \nSTARCK Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes. \nMILLER Let's go. \nMiller slides down a ladder into the war-room. The others follow into... \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY \nBulky EVA (extra-vehicular activity) suits line the walls. MUSIC blares from a JAMBOX, built into a storage locker. \nAn Emergency Tech stows safety lines: COOPER -- male, the resident pain-in-the-ass. He SINGS along with the music. \nMILLER (not breaking stride) Kill it. \nCooper reaches up, turns off the box. \nCOOPER Time to play Spam in the can. \nMILLER Don't start with me, Cooper. \nCooper falls in as the crew continues into... \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS \nEvidence of long term habitation. Personalized lockers. Fold- down bunks, chairs, tables; currently stowed for docking. A modular galley. \nPETERS (female, Emergency Technician, the crew's denmother) and DJ (male, Doctor, a cold perfectionist) load CO2 scrubbers into a bin in the floor. \nWeir stands to the side like a fifth wheel. \nWEIR Captain Miller, I just want to say... \nMILLER The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks. \nWeir hesitates, then follows the crew into Medical. Miller hangs back. \nMILLER What's the hold up? \nPETERS Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers. (to Miller, accusatory) Good for four months. \nMILLER I put in for a replacement for you but no one... \nPETERS No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer. (beat) Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months. \nMILLER I am sorry. But now we have to go to work. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL \nA high tech operating room. Modular equipment. Vertical tanks line the walls, each large enough to hold a human being: gravity couches. \nThe crew stands before the gravity couches, almost nude, no room for modesty. \nStarck catches Cooper looking at her ass as she strips to her undergarments. Cooper grins. She flips him off, not bothering to turn around. \nCOOPER Is that an offer? \nSTARCK It is not. \nMiller disrobes. Two service tags hang around his neck. He does not remove them. Weir approaches him. \nWEIR Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity... \nMILLER Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why. \nWEIR I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space. \nMILLER Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way. \nWeir nods, moves to an empty couch bearing his name, written on a piece of tape. Peters watches him. \nPETERS First time in a grav couch? \nWEIR Yes. \nShe checks Weir's couch, helps him climb in. Weir keeps one eye on Miller. \nPETERS (Off of Weir's glance) Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL \nReality. Weir's eyes open. He presses against the glass of the tank, trying to force it open, panicked. The others are already stepping from open tanks. \nWeir's tank opens with a HISS. He tumbles to the floor, gasping, fluid streaming from his mouth. \nPeters rushes to him. \nWEIR (gasping) Claire... \nPETERS DJ! (to Weir) It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe. \nWeir catches his breath. He looks up. The crew surrounds him, concerned. \nWEIR I'm alright now. I'm alright... \nDJ helps him to his feet. \nDJ Move slowly. You've been in stasis for fifty-six days. You're going to experience a little disorientation. \nWeir nods. \nCOOPER Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee? \nWEIR What? \nCOOPER Coffee. \nWEIR No, thank you. \nCooper, still butt-naked and proud of it, grabs a metal cylinder from the wall and pours a mug for himself. \nCOOPER Hey, Starck. You wanna dry my back? \nStarck gives him a cool once over. \nSTARCK Maybe when you finish puberty. \nMiller zips up. \nMILLER Starck, why aren't you on the bridge? \nSTARCK I just finished drying... \nMILLER Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go! (to Cooper) And Cooper... Put some pants on. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. INTERPLANETARY SPACE - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL \nSILENCE. The Lewis and Clark drifts towards Neptune. \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS \nThe crew has secured the quarters from flight status. Bunks have been folded down, each alcove personalized with photographs and pin-ups. \nDJ moves around the cabin, checking the crew's radiation badges. \nCooper and Justin sit on their bunks, tossing a handball across the cabin. \nPeters holds a \"Watchman\" video unit, watching a \"video letter\"... \nEXT. PETERS HOME - GARDEN (DENNY'S PARTY) \n...from DENNY, her four-year-old son, a paraplegic, grinning widely in his new wheelchair: \nDENNY (video) Play horsey, Mommy, play horsey... \nIN THE VIDEO, Peters enters shot, scoops her child from the chair. \nPETERS (video) Want to play horsey, do you... (etc.) \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARKE - QUARTERS \nWeir sits huddled in a blanket. Miller takes a seat next to him. \nStarck and Smith enter. Starck sits next to Miller. \nSMITH 30 hours to Neptune orbit. \nSTARCK All boards are green, everything's five by five. \nMILLER That's good to know. Justin, you wanna stow that? \nJustin catches the ball, holds onto it. \nMILLER Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer -- \nCOOPER You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that... \nMILLER This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway? \nJUSTIN Ballast. \nCOOPER (to Weir) I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker... \nMILLER He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ... \nHe activates a different file. The resulting WAIL is more human but no less terrifying, a cry of despair. The last message from a drowning man... \nSMITH Jesus... \nMILLER What is that? \nDJ It sounds like Latin. \nCOOPER Latin? Who the fuck speaks Latin? \nSTARCK No one. It's a dead language. \nDJ Mostly dead. \nMILLER What does it say? \nWEIR NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message... \nWeir plays the HELLISH INCANTATION for a third time. \nWEIR There: \"...liberatis me...\" They haven't been able to translate the rest, it's too distorted. \nDJ \"Liberatis me.\" \"Save me.\" \nCOOPER From what? \nMILLER (to Weir) You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years? \nWEIR The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now. \nCOOPER Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this? \nMILLER You heard the tape, Smith. We're looking for survivors. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEPTUNE - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL \nThe Lewis and Clark closes in on the blue planet. \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE \nThe flight crew assembled. Data flashes across the main monitors on the bridge. \nSTARCK Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees. \nMILLER Come around to three-three-four... \nSMITH (echoing) Heading three-three-four... \nMILLER (continuing) ...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees... \nSMITH One-four degrees... \nEXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - NEPTUNE ORBIT - MODEL \nRCS thrusters pivot and fire as the ship enters Neptune orbit, dropping lower and lower into the dense blue clouds... \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE \nThe ship begins to rock as it encounters atmosphere, a growing vibration. \nGRAPHICS flash across the main window's HUD. Neptune's dark shadow fills the screen. \nSMITH We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop. \nMILLER Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening... \nSTARCK (into radio) This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... (she continues B.G.) \nSMITH (over Starck) Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this... \nMILLER We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out... \nSMITH That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know... \nMILLER What are you trying to say? \"If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?\" \nSMITH Something like that, yeah. \nMiller grins grimly. \nMILLER I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady. \nSMITH Yes, sir. \nMILLER Dr. Weir...! \nWeir sticks his head into the bridge. \nMILLER I think you want to see this. \nWeir climbs up the ladder to the flight deck. \nWEIR Where is she? \nSMITH Dead ahead, 5000 meters. \nSuddenly, the ship SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY. \nEXT. EVENT HORIZON - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL \nThe Lewis and Clark carefully maneuvers in close to the Event Horizon's airlock. \nA mechanical boom-arm extends from the smaller ship to latch onto the Event Horizon. Its clawed hand grabs the antennae cluster. The cluster buckles under the stress. \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE \nSMITH (to Weir) It is now. (to Miller) We're locked in. \nMILLER Starck, give me a read. \nA scan of the Event Horizon appears across Starck's screen. \nSTARCK The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious. \nWEIR Do they have pressure? \nSTARCK Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis. \nMILLER Find 'em, Starck. \nStarck frowns at her display. \nSTARCK Something's wrong with the bio-scan. \nMILLER Radiation interference? \nSTARCK There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location. \nWEIR Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan? \nSTARCK If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense. \nMILLER Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on. \nJUSTIN Yes, sir! \nWeir starts to follow Justin from the bridge. \nMILLER Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge. \nWEIR Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship... \nMILLER Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board -- \nWEIR (interrupting) That is not acceptable -- \nMILLER (overlapping) -- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is! (beat) I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job. \nWeir exhales. \nWEIR Very well. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL \nThe docking collar umbilicus extends to the Event Horizon's airlock. \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY \nMiller, Peters, Justin and Cooper in EVA; Cooper and Justin, without headgear. \nCOOPER ...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on... \nMILLER (muffled) You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens... \nCOOPER I'll be all over it. \nMiller nods to Peters. \nPETERS (muffled) Opening inner airlock door. \nThe inner airlock door opens: CH-THUNK. Miller, Peters and Justin enter the airlock. Justin attaches his safety line. Miller and Peters do not. \nCOOPER You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins. \nJUSTIN I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man. \nCooper puts Justin's helmet on. It seals tight. \nCOOPER (serious now) You just keep your nose clean, Baby Bear. Clear the door. \nCooper backs out, allowing the inner airlock door to shut, ECHOING through the ship. \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS \nMiller, Peters and Justin float down the brightly lit umbilicus into the Event Horizon, all in EVA suits. Justin's safety line trails out behind him. \nThe OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR of the Event Horizon waits for them. \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE \nWeir has taken over Justin's station. He watches the POV monitors like a kid watching Christmas. Smith and Starck keep tabs over his shoulder. \nWEIR You've reached the outer airlock door. \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS \nWeir peers eagerly at the monitors. \nWEIR Any survivors? \nMILLER (O.S.) (radio) Negative. \nHope drains from Weir's face. \nWEIR No one? \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY \nMILLER They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward. \nMiller and Peters split up, each taking a separate exit from the chamber. \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE \nWeir looks at Justin's POV screen: a grainy image of the First Containment Seal. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR (BY FIRST SEAL) \nJustin stands before a thick pressure door. Justin checks the door with his thumper, his boots are now on. \nWEIR (O.S.) (radio) You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side. \nJUSTIN We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour. \nWEIR (O.S.) (radio) Background radiation. Perfectly safe. \nJustin touches a panel beside the door. It opens. He enters... \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT \n...a long corridor shaped like a tube. It rotates like a turbine, causing vertigo. Justin's BREATH echoes in his helmet as he moves forward... \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY \nCooper stares at Justin's safety line in the airlock. \nTHE SAFETY LINE \ncounts off silently, passing 150 meters... \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE \nThe corridor ends at a pressure door. \nPETERS Dr. Weir, what's this the door to? \nWEIR (O.S.) (radio) You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew? \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE \nMiller, moving through a deserted lab. Empty operating tables. Stainless steel surgical instruments float in zero-G. A glove floats up behind him, brushes his shoulder. He wheels... the glove is empty. It spins away. \nMILLER If we saw any crew, Doctor, you'd know about it. (looking around) I'm in Medical. No casualties, it looks like this place has never been used. \nHe finds a computer console. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE \nPeters opens the door. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER \nPeters enters. Looks around: a small antechamber for crew briefings, with chairs and a display table. Red crystals float in a crimson mist around her. \nPETERS I found something. \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE \nWeir peers at the monitors, trying to make out the red haze. \nWEIR Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that? \nPETERS (O.S.) (radio) Blood. Looks like arterial spray. \nWEIR (nervous) Can you see a body? \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER \nPETERS (confused) There's no one here. \nMILLER (O.S.) (radio) The blood came from somewhere, Peters... \nPETERS There's no one here, Skipper. \nPeters takes a sample container from her belt. Carefully tries to capture a suspended crystal... \nPETERS Come on... \nCLOSE UP OF THE BLOOD CRYSTAL \nand the Container; Peters' brow furrowed with concentration. \nWIDER AS A FLASH OF BLUE LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES THE ROOM, REVEALING... \n...THE WALL BEHIND PETERS, CASED IN A FROZEN EXPLOSION OF BLOOD AND TISSUE. Someone died here in a violent and terrible way. \nMILLER Boarding party, sound off... Peters, do you read me... . Peters... \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE \nPeters' light, too, remains dark, but Neptune's blue light fills the Bridge. The frozen corpse floats before her. No longer a man. \nA young boy, maybe five years old. His legs are withered, useless things. The skin remains a crystallized surface, but the eyes look straight at her, alive. \nPETERS Denny... \nPeters reaches out to touch the body. It falls away from her. No longer her son, but the body of the astronaut. It hits the door and shatters. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE \nMILLER (growing desperation) ...Peters, do you read me... \nA MAN'S VOICE, in agony, CRACKLES over Miller's radio: \nVOICE (radio) Don't leave me... \nMILLER Justin? Justin, sound off... Justin...! \nMiller trails off as RED LIGHT flickers across his visor. He turns... \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE (BURNING MAN) POV MILLER \nA BURNING MAN stands in Medical/Science, a human body wreathed in flame. The eyes are like sunspots. As the Burning Man moves, bones and black flesh poke through the fire. He raises one hand to point at Miller in accusation... \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE \nMiller's BREATH stops in his throat. His mouth works but nothing comes out. He BLINKS... \n...and the VISION is gone. Miller is alone, BREATHING hard. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT \nCooper enters at full speed, shooting through in a controlled fall... \nCOOPER Hold on, Baby Bear... \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT \n...into the Second Containment. He catches himself at the console. Cooper sees Justin's safety line, cut off abruptly by the darkness of the Core. \nCOOPER Oh my God... \nThe darkness of the Core ripples... \nJustin suddenly emerges from the darkness, a white figure riding a wave of impenetrable blackness. \nCooper catches him, holds him tight as the wave carries them towards the wall. Cooper sees a control rod -- a long metal spike -- coming at them. He twists his body so that they miss -- barely -- before slamming into the wall. \nCOOPER Justin, do you read me? Justin... . \nCooper pulls Justin close. Justin's head lolls to one side. Unconscious. \nCOOPER Baby Bear, don't do this. Don't do this... \nINT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE \nWeir, Starck and Smith continue to hold on tightly as the vibration builds... and builds... \nSTARCK Here comes another one! Hold on! \nThe second wave hits. Sparks fly as consoles EXPLODE. Deep in the ship metal SCREAMS, followed by the SHRIEK of escaping atmosphere. An emergency klaxon RINGS out: PRESSURE WARNING. \nStarck checks Justin's station: \nSTARCK We lost the starboard baffle! The hull's been breached! \nThe Bridge pressure door begins to close...and then stop. \nSMITH The safety circuit's failed! \nWEIR We're losing atmosphere... \nSTARCK There are pressure suits in the Airlock. Go! \nStarck pushes Weir ahead of her, Smith follows hard as they run the length of the ship for the airlock bay. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE \nThe vibration subsides. \nMILLER Can anybody hear me... \nPETERS (O.S.) (radio) Skipper... \nMILLER Peters... \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE \nMILLER (O.S.) (radio) ...you okay? \nPETERS Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay. \nHer voice cracks as she says it. She looks anything but. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE \nMiller pulls his helmet off with a HISS. He breathes deep. Starck does the same, coughs. \nSTARCK It tastes bad. \nMILLER But you can breathe it. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEPTUNE ORBIT - LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON \nThe Lewis and Clark and the Event Horizon, locked together in Neptune orbit. Lights shine from the Horizon as power is restored. No longer cloaked in darkness, it is revealed in all its hideous glory, a nightmare etched in steel. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE \nWeir moves from station to station, restoring power to each. \nStarck sits at the communications workstation. Miller watches over her shoulder. \nSTARCK The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us. \nMILLER How much oh-two do we have? \nSTARCK Oxygen is not the problem. \nMILLER Carbon dioxide? \nSTARCK (nods) It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot. \nMILLER We can take the filters from the Clark... \nSTARCK I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home. \nMILLER What about the life readings you picked up? \nSTARCK The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: \"Bio-readings of indeterminate origin.\" Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels. \nMILLER What's causing the readings? \nSTARCK I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew. \nMILLER So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions? \nWeir just stares at the bloodstained wall. \nMILLER What happened here? \nMiller follows Weir's gaze to the wall: a Rorschach test in blood... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE WINDOW \nPULL BACK from the bridge windows TO REVEAL... \nEXT. EVENT HORIZON - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL \n...the Event Horizon in all its horrific glory, hanging skew in the center of the hurricane like a mote in God's eye. \nThe Lewis and Clark clings to the giant craft, as insignificant as a tick. An even smaller figure clings to the hull of the Lewis and Clark... \nEXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION \nIt's Smith, EVA in full protective gear. His magnetic boots hold him to the Lewis and Clark's hull. He kneels over a hole in the hull, where the metal has buckled and torn. Vapor still leaks from the hole into space. \nSMITH Captain Miller, you copy? \nMILLER (O.S.) (radio) I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark? \nSMITH I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time. \nMILLER (O.S.) (radio) We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air. \nSMITH Understood. \nSmith uses a foam applicator to fill the hole. The gel freezes in place. Smith reaches to his belt, pulls out a ZERO-G NAILGUN. Presses it to the patch and begins to rivet it into place. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE \nJustin lies unmoving on a table. His eyes are open, staring at a smear of blood on the ceiling. \nA needle slides into the skin below his eye. He doesn't respond. \nDJ removes the needle. It glistens with blood. He looks up at Miller and Peters. \nMILLER How is he? \nDJ His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all. \nPETERS What happened to him? \nDJ shakes his head. Miller eyes the bloodstain above them. \nMILLER DJ, take samples from these stains, compare them to medical records, I want to know whose blood this is. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE \nWEIR The Core...! \nWeir heads for the door. \nMILLER Wait! \nBut Weir has vanished into the corridor. \nMILLER The rest of you, stay here, I don't want anyone else going near that thing. \nMiller follows after Weir. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT \nThe Second Containment Seal opens. Weir is about to enter when Miller stops him. He checks a Geiger counter. It is silent. \nMILLER No radiation. What's causing the drain? \nWeir crosses to a console. Frowns. \nWEIR (shakes his head) The magnetic fields are holding. Maybe a short in the fail-safe circuit. I'll check it out. \nMiller assists Weir in removing bolts from an access panel. The panel falls away, revealing a cramped duct leading into the ship's circuitry. \nWeir climbs into the duct. Miller hands him a flashlight and a toolkit. \nMILLER We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad. \nWEIR Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries. \nWeir begins to crawl into the depths of the ship. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT \nWeir's breath ECHOES in the cramped shaft. He counts off circuit panels as he goes: \nWEIR E-three... E-five... E-seven... where are you... \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT \nMiller slogs through the coolant to the Core. Stares at it. It remains metallic, mundane. \nHe pulls out a Geiger counter and crosses to the reactor shell. Examines a gleaming weld. The Geiger counter CLICKS slowly: no leak. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE \nA yellow light starts flashing on the engineering board. Starck's eyes widen: the engineering sections flash yellow...and green... \nSTARCK What the hell... \nSTARCK'S POV \nas the bio-scan goes wild. \nSTARCK (into intercom) Skipper, the bio-scan just went off the scale... \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE \nJustin shakes on the bed in an epileptic fit. DJ rushes to him. \nDJ Justin! Can you hear me? Justin! \nJustin's eyes remain unfocused, unseeing as he tries to speak. \nDJ leans in close, trying to hear him speak... \nJustin arches in agony and the words come in a strangled, tortured voice: \nJUSTIN THE DARK IS COMING... \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT \nWeir stops before module E-12. Hears a faint HISSING and POPPING. \nWEIR There you are. \nHe uses a screwdriver to open up the module. Reveals a series of circuit boards. One SPARKS. Weir plucks the damaged chips and starts running a by-pass. \nHis flashlight flickers. He bangs it against the duct wall. It grows dimmer. Goes out. \nWEIR Um. Captain Miller? I, uh, I seem to have a problem with my light. \nA single DRIP of water in the darkness... \nWEIR (beat, hushed) Captain Miller? \nAnother DRIP, then a woman's VOICE like a distant echo: \nVOICE Billy. \nWeir starts at the sound. He recognizes the voice. \nShe speaks again, no longer far away, but a close WHISPER in his ear: \nCLAIRE (O.S.) Billy. Help me. I'm so cold. \nWeir's eyes open wide in hope and fear. \nMiller heads him off, grabs him. \nMILLER That's it, that's enough for one day, Smith! I need you back on the Clark, I need you calm, I need you using your head, you make a mistake out there, none of are getting home, you understand? \nSmith calms. \nSMITH Sir. \nMILLER Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly. \nSmith leaves. \nMILLER We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time. \nWEIR I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain. \nMILLER Do it. \nDJ To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep. \nMILLER I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers. \nMiller exits. Starck follows. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR \nSTARCK TRAILS MILLER: \nSTARCK Miller... \nMILLER (not slowing) What is it, Starck? \nSTARCK ...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin... \nMILLER (simultaneous) \"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin,\" don't you have anything useful to tell me? \nSTARCK I've got a theory. \nMiller stops. \nMILLER Go ahead. \nSTARCK There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system... \nMiller starts walking again. \nMILLER I don't need to hear this. \nShe rushes to follow. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 2 \nMiller and Starck enter the Airlock Bay: \nSTARCK You've got to listen... \nMILLER To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive? \nSTARCK I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us... \nMILLER We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories... \nShe grabs him by the arm. \nSTARCK It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports... \nMILLER Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible. \nSTARCK I know that. \nBeat. Miller allows himself to relax. \nMILLER If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time? \nSTARCK I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have. \nMiller pulls an EVA suit from the wall, starts putting it on. \nMILLER What I want is to survive the next ten hours. \nSTARCK (checks her watch) Nine hours and twenty-two minutes. \nMILLER I'm going outside to work on the Clark.

He can see the exterior airlock just beyond a deep chasm in the ship's superstructure. If he misses this jump, Justin will not be the only man to die today. \nHe doesn't hesitate but leaps, soaring across the chasm towards the airlock. \nJUSTIN (radio) ...I don't want to die...! \nMILLER You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright? \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3 \nJUSTIN But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please... \nMILLER (radio) Justin. I won't let you die. \nMiller's words give Justin hope.

He focuses on the 5 meters of space between him and the airlock... \nThe outer doors OPEN... \nThe rush of escaping atmosphere carries Justin's body out... \nMiller pushes off... catches Justin's body... sending them both back towards the open Airlock... \nIce forms on Justin's body. His veins bulge. Blood fountains from his noise and mouth, forming a red icicle over his face. \nMiller pulls him into the Airlock. Five seconds have passed since the airlock door opened. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3 \nMiller closes the Airlock behind them. Air HISSES into the chamber. Justin's body hits the deck as \"normal\" gravity exerts itself. \nMiller opens the Inner Door. Peters and DJ rush in. \nPETERS Oh God... Justin... \nDJ puts a tube in the Justin's mouth immediately, feeding him oxygen. \nPETERS I've got a pulse, he's alive... \nDJ Pressure? \nPETERS 90 over 50 and falling... . \nDJ He's crashing... \nBlood bubbles from Justin's mouth and eyes. He GASPS, then SCREAMS, spraying blood from his mouth. \nDJ He can breathe. That's good. Let's get him to Medical, go, go! \nStarck helps DJ and Peters carry Justin from the Airlock. Miller sits there, exhausted. Reaches up and pulls his helmet off. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EVENT HORIZON -- BRIDGE \nVOICE (O.S.)

Darkness swallows all. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY \nDJ enters, checks Justin's display. \nMILLER (O.S.) Any change? \nDJ turns, surprised. Miller sits, barely visible in the dark. \nDJ No. No change. (beat) I've analyzed Justin's blood samples. There's no evidence of excessive levels of carbon dioxide. Or anything else out of ordinary. \nA grim LAUGH from Miller. \nMILLER Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things. (beat) I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close. \nDJ \"Another man?\" Who? \nMiller nods, pulls his service medal from beneath his jumpsuit. \nMILLER It was on the Goliath. There was this bosun, Corrick, a young guy, a lot like Justin. Edmund Corrick, from Decatur, Georgia. He got caught when the pressure doors sealed, one closed on his arm. Severed it at the wrist. The pain of that must have been... He passed out and... \nMiller trails off. DJ waits patiently. Finally: \nMILLER I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone. (beat) I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of. (beat, wan smile) And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide. \nDJ No. \nMiller sees something in DJ's expression. \nMILLER What is it? \nDJ I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation. \nMILLER Go on. \nDJ plays the recording again. Stops it abruptly. \nDJ They thought it said, \"Liberatis me,\" \"Save me,\" but it's not \"me.\" It's \"tutemet:\" \"Save yourself.\" \nMILLER It's not a distress call. It's a warning. \nDJ It gets worse. \nMiller stares at him. \nDJ It's very hard to make out, but listen to this final part. \nHe plays the recording again. \nDJ Do you hear it? Right there. \nMILLER Hear what? \nDJ It sounds like \"ex infera:\" \"ex,\" from; \"infera,\" the ablative case of \"inferi.\" \"Hell.\" \nMILLER \"Save yourself. From Hell.\" (beat) What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed? \nDJ No. I don't believe in that sort of thing. (beat) But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen... (beat) And what it's brought back with it. \nDJ looks at Miller. He does not have an answer. The intercom CRACKLES: \nCOOPER (O.S.)

She won't let you. \nMILLER Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home. \nWeir is swallowed by the darkness. \nWEIR (O.S.)

Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all. \nSTARCK Claire is your wife? \nWEIR Yes. \nSTARCK It must be hard, being so far away from her. \nWEIR Yes. I miss her.

She BREATHES in ragged gasps, opens his eyes... \nThen stops. She stares over Miller's shoulder like a deer caught in the headlights. \nMiller looks behind him... \nWEIR STANDS THERE, STARING WITH EYES SEWN SHUT. \nMiller reaches for the gun... \nWeir hits him, sending Miller across the bridge into a bulkhead.

He is safe... \nSTARCK (O.S.) Don't leave me! \nMiller turns. Starck clings to a console, barely able to resist the winds that try to suck her into the void. \nSTARCK (gasping for air) Please... help, help me... \nMiller hesitates, looking from Starck back into the safety of the ship. The door continues to shut. In seconds, he will be safe. And she will be dead. \nMiller YELLS and rips a compressor from its mount, wedges it in the door to keep it open.

Their veins begin to bulge, blood pulses from their noses.

No one's going to be coming to help us. \nMILLER How much oh-two do we have? \nSTARCK Oxygen is not the problem. \nMILLER Carbon dioxide? \nSTARCK (nods) It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot. \nMILLER We can take the filters from the Clark... \nSTARCK I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home. \nMILLER What about the life readings you picked up? \nSTARCK The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: \"Bio-readings of indeterminate origin.\" Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels. \nMILLER What's causing the readings? \nSTARCK I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew. \nMILLER So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions? \nWeir just stares at the bloodstained wall. \nMILLER What happened here? \nMiller follows Weir's gaze to the wall: a Rorschach test in blood... \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

EVENT HORIZON - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL \n...the Event Horizon in all its horrific glory, hanging skew in the center of the hurricane like a mote in God's eye. \nThe Lewis and Clark clings to the giant craft, as insignificant as a tick. An even smaller figure clings to the hull of the Lewis and Clark... \nEXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION \nIt's Smith, EVA in full protective gear. His magnetic boots hold him to the Lewis and Clark's hull. He kneels over a hole in the hull, where the metal has buckled and torn. Vapor still leaks from the hole into space. \nSMITH Captain Miller, you copy? \nMILLER (O.S.) (radio) I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark? \nSMITH I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time. \nMILLER (O.S.) (radio) We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air. \nSMITH Understood. \nSmith uses a foam applicator to fill the hole. The gel freezes in place. Smith reaches to his belt, pulls out a ZERO-G NAILGUN. Presses it to the patch and begins to rivet it into place. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE \nJustin lies unmoving on a table. His eyes are open, staring at a smear of blood on the ceiling. \nA needle slides into the skin below his eye. He doesn't respond. \nDJ removes the needle. It glistens with blood. He looks up at Miller and Peters. \nMILLER How is he? \nDJ His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all. \nPETERS What happened to him? \nDJ shakes his head.

Cooper bounces the handball on the floor, a reflex action. \nMiller stares at a video monitor, watching Smith repair the Lewis and Clark. He turns from the window. \nMILLER Okay, people, there's been a change in the mission. In less than eighteen hours, we will run out of breathable air. Our primary objective is now survival. That means we focus on repairing the Lewis and Clark and salvaging whatever will buy us more time. (pause) Our secondary objective is finding out what happened to this ship and its crew. Two months from now, I fully intend to be standing in front of the good Admiral giving my report, and I'd like to have more than my dick in my hands. \nGrim smiles all around. \nMILLER Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers. \nPETERS I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin... \nMILLER Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan... \nSTARCK What's the point? I'll just get the same thing... \nMILLER Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found. \nSTARCK I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins. \nMILLER Do it. Dr. Weir... \nWEIR Yes. \nMILLER One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him. \nCOOPER I told you. He was inside the Core... \nWeir starts shaking his head. \nCOOPER It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal... \nWEIR (cutting him off) No, he didn't. \nCOOPER You weren't there. I saw it. \nWEIR Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible... \nCooper throws the ball at him, hard. Weir ducks. It bounces wildly around the room. Miller catches it. \nMILLER Cooper! Enough! \nCooper sits down. \nMILLER (turning on Weir) Dr. Weir, Justin may die. Whatever happened to him could happen to all of us. \nBeat. \nWEIR I don't know what happened to Justin. \nCOOPER I'm telling you, I saw it... \nWEIR What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion. \nCOOPER (turning on Weir) I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking \"optical effect!\" \nMILLER Hold on, what's this \"gravitational distortion?\" \nWEIR It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark. \nMILLER What could cause them? (Weir doesn't answer) What's in the Core? \nWEIR It's complicated... \nMILLER How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core? \nBeat. Here comes another bomb... \nWEIR A black hole. \nThe crew stares at him, stunned. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

The PULSE of the ship is loud here, a deep THRUM that steals their breath. Weir's voice is a reverent WHISPER: \nWEIR That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light. \nSTARCK I can't believe we built this. \nMILLER It's insane. \nWEIR \"Insane?\" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day... \nMILLER If it worked. \nWEIR If it worked, yes. \nINT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT - 3RD SEAL \nThey stare at the Core, the surrounding machinery moving in a slow giant's dance. A trick of the eye, or does the Core stare back at them? \nINT.

Miller sits, barely visible in the dark. \nDJ No. No change. (beat) I've analyzed Justin's blood samples. There's no evidence of excessive levels of carbon dioxide. Or anything else out of ordinary. \nA grim LAUGH from Miller. \nMILLER Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things. (beat) I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close. \nDJ \"Another man?\" Who? \nMiller nods, pulls his service medal from beneath his jumpsuit. \nMILLER It was on the Goliath. There was this bosun, Corrick, a young guy, a lot like Justin. Edmund Corrick, from Decatur, Georgia. He got caught when the pressure doors sealed, one closed on his arm. Severed it at the wrist. The pain of that must have been... He passed out and... \nMiller trails off. DJ waits patiently. Finally: \nMILLER I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone. (beat) I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of. (beat, wan smile) And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide. \nDJ No. \nMiller sees something in DJ's expression. \nMILLER What is it? \nDJ I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation. \nMILLER Go on. \nDJ plays the recording again. Stops it abruptly. \nDJ They thought it said, \"Liberatis me,\" \"Save me,\" but it's not \"me.\" It's \"tutemet:\" \"Save yourself.\" \nMILLER It's not a distress call. It's a warning. \nDJ It gets worse. \nMiller stares at him. \nDJ It's very hard to make out, but listen to this final part. \nHe plays the recording again. \nDJ Do you hear it? Right there. \nMILLER Hear what? \nDJ It sounds like \"ex infera:\" \"ex,\" from; \"infera,\" the ablative case of \"inferi.\" \"Hell.\" \nMILLER \"Save yourself. From Hell.\" (beat) What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed? \nDJ No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.

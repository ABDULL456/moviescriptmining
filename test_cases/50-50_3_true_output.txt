MITCH Fake. 
ADAM Fake. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal an INSANELY HOT WOMAN with giant breasts in a hospital gown walk by the three men. 
ALAN You're both wrong. I think I know real when I see it. 
The hot woman scratches her head, revealing that she's wearing a WIG. 
ALAN (CONT'D) God damn it. 
Alan hands Adam and Mitch each a five dollar bill. 
Mitch notices Adam watching one of the OTHER PATIENT's sitting and laughing with HIS WIFE. There's a longing in Adam's eyes. 
MITCH How come we've never met Rachel? 
ALAN Yeah. What the fuck? 
ADAM She's been really stressed lately, 
Adam looks around at all the sick people. 
ADAM (CONT'D) If I brought her here, she'd probably freak out. 
ALAN Smart man. Save yourself the headache. 
MITCH Don't listen to him Adam. It's important to be with your loved ones in times like these. 
ALAN Bullshit. Women are nothing but trouble. (MORE) 
ALAN (CONT'D) They're selfish animals who only add to the misery in your life. You want to talk about a cancer. 
MITCH Listen to me Adam, I've been married 40 years and it's my Margaret who keeps me going. 
Mitch pulls out his wallet. He holds out a picture of his wife MARGARET (80). 
MITCH (CONT'D) She's my reason to live. 
ALAN That's precious Mitch, I almost want to wrap it up and tie a little bow around it. (TO ADAM) Honestly, I don't give a shit. You can do whatever you want. It's your life. All I know is that I'm not going to spend my last days on this miserable planet pining over a woman. The day my wife left me was the best day of my life. 
Adam let's this soak in. 
EXT. HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON 
Adam's on his cell phone pacing in front of the hospital. 
RACHEL (V.O.) Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing something really important. I'll give you a call when I'm done...yay! 
ADAM (INTO PHONE) Hey it's me, just checking to see if you're on your way. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - LATER 
Adam paces impatiently. He calls Rachel again, it goes straight to voice mail. 
RACHEL (V.O.) Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing something really important. I'll give you a call when I'm done...yay! 
ADAM (INTO PHONE) It's me again. Just checking to see where you are. In case you're looking for me I'm now on the other side of the parking lot. Call me. 
As Katie walks to her car, she sees Adam pacing and mumbling to himself. 
KATIE Adam? 
ADAM (EMBARRASSED) Oh hey. 
KATIE What are you doing? 
ADAM Just waiting for Rachel to pick me up. 
KATIE What time is she coming? 
ADAM Uh, four. 
Katie looks at her watch. 
KATIE It's six thirty. 
ADAM She must be stuck in traffic. 
KATIE You want a ride? 
INT. KATIE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

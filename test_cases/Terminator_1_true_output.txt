WHIP-PANNING WITH THE CRUISER as it crashes upside-down through the counter area of an A & W. 
LOW ANGLE as Reese and Sarah slide to a stop in a cloud of tire smoke. Transmission fluid pours out of the car like blood. An instant later they are surrounded by an assortment of LAPD, SHERIFF'S DEPT., and CHP CARS. The helicopter hovers overhead. 
MEDIUM ON SARAH AND REESE, he raises his hands, through the side window, in plain sight. A phalanx of cops, guns drawn, approaches the car warily. 
Sarah looks at Reese.  Then at the cops.  She opens the door and runs, staggering, toward them.  Vukovich steps forward and pulls her away to safety. 
C.U. - REESE watching her go as a cop eases his door open.

150     EXT. A & W - NIGHT                                     150 
Two cops approach the overturned squad car jammed into the wreckage of the small building. They shine their flashlights inside. It is empty. 
The cyborg has VANISHED. 
A sign which reads 'DRIVE IN' detaches from an awning and crashed down across the crushed auto.

151     INT. VUKOVICH'S OFFICE - NIGHT                         151 
Sarah, huddles in a blanket, is siting on a bench opposite Vukovich's desk.  Motionless.  Her eyes are fixed on the middle distance.  She's been crying.  Now she's emptied out. 
The door opens. At the sound of the latch Sarah jerks as if struck, and cringes involuntarily.  Vukovich enters with Traxler and DR. PETER SILBERMAN, a criminal psychologist.  Silberman is smooth of skin and manner, young, ambitious and...fat.  He is enthusiastic about the workings of the human psyche, as emotionally involved as someone pulling the wings off a fly. 
Vukovich sits beside Sarah and hands her a cup of coffee. He puts a paternal arm around her shoulders. 
VUKOVICH Here, drink some of this... 
SARAH (voice flat, desperate) Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies. 
VUKOVICH They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt. 
Sarah  begins to cry again, slowly and very quickly. 
SARAH (to herself) Of, God...Ginger...kiddo, I'm so sorry. 
Vukovich takes the coffee cup from her as her arms sag and it starts to spill. 
VUKOVICH (gently) Sarah. (pause) Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it? 
SARAH (almost in- audible) I guess so. (to Silberman) You're a doctor? 
SILBERMAN A criminal psychologist. 
SARAH Is Reese crazy? 
SILBERMAN That's what we're going to find out.

152     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                152 
The room costs five dollars a night and that's steep, but the FIRE ESCAPE outside the window adds an element of strategic value. A silhouette slips in through the window and click on the single BARE LIGHT BULB. It's Terminator, and he's a mess. A bloody scarecrow with bullet wounds in stomach, chest, shoulder and right wrist. 
MEDIUM ON TERMINATOR as he sits at a ratty folding table under the light. His eyebrows are singed off. Hair a charred stubble. Left eyes glistening with imbedded glass shards. 
Before him on the table is an array of SMALL TOOLS. He removes the charred remains of his jacket and props. one elbow on the table. 
ANGLE PAST HIS NON-FUNCTIONAL RIGHT ARM, F.G., as he exam- ines it.  He picks up an X-ACTO KNIFE and cuts deeply into the skin of his forearm. His expression is one of mild concentration. 
E.C.U. - FOREARM, as he pulls back a large flap of skin to reveal a complex trunk of SHEATHED CABLES AND HYDRAULICS. They slide as he moves his fingers. 
RESUME MEDIUM, as Terminator uses a rag to wipe away the blood.  With small screwdrivers he begins to patiently dis- assemble the damaged mechanism around the 12-guage hit.

153     INT. DIVISION HQ/INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT            153 
The room is small, furnished with only a table and two chairs. Reese, his arms handcuffed behind him, sits opposite Dr. Silberman.  Behind Silberman is a large mirror.  A DETECTIVE leans against the wall. 
SILBERMAN So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom? 
REESE With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27-- 
SILBERMAN (interrupting) The year 2027? 
CUT TO: 
154     INT. OBSERVATION ROOM                                  154 
Vukovich and Traxler are seated in the dark room, watching Reese, B.G., through the two-way mirror.  Just behind the glass is a VIDEO CAMERA ON A TRIPOD, aimed at Reese, and a CART holding a SMALL MONITOR and VIDEOCASSETTE RECORDER. 
REESE (through speaker) That's right. 
TRAXLER (quietly, to Vukovich) This is fucking great.

INT. KITCHEN. FLOOD STREET. LONDON. 1974. DAWN. Laughter - 
VOICES on the approach- 
CAROL Thanks Ma, that was terrific! I really feel I've got a handle on it now. 
CAROL and MARGARET entering kitchen, still giddy from their adventure. 
CAROL (CONT'D) You should have seen us, Pa. 
DENIS in his dressing gown burning toast and attempting to make breakfast - 
MARGARET Have you been trying to make breakfast? For Goodness sake, Denis! 
DENIS scrapes down the toast, eggs boiling in the pan. 
DENIS I can boil a bloody egg. CAROL Mummy took me for a test drive - We went absolutely everywhere. All over the place - MARGARET (sudden/cutting in) I've decided. I'm going to run. MARGARET smiles, a growing resolution gripping her. DENIS What for? MARGARET I'm going to run for Leader of the Party. CAROL'S utter disappointment on seeing she has lost MARGARET already. 
CAROL Silly me! 
CAROL storms out of the kitchen. 
DENIS (calling after) Good luck! CAROL (O.S.) All the time I thought I was having a driving lesson, it was all about my mother, just for a change! 
MARGARET What's she on about? 
DENIS It's her driving test this morning! 
MARGARET Oh, right. Of course. 
A BEAT. DENIS Are you saying you want to be Prime Minister? MARGARET (with false patience) What I'm saying is that someone must force the point, say the unsayable. None of these men have the guts. MARGARET sees the burnt toast and energetically starts clearing up and putting more bread under the grill. 
DENIS The Prime Minister has been very loyal to you, MT. He tries, with a trembling hand, to scoop boiled eggs from the pan. MARGARET But he's weak, and he's weakened the party. One must know when to go. (glancing at him) You're shaking. She reaches out. DENIS I can do it! DENIS pulls his arm away, sending boiled eggs flying. SILENCE. MARGARET Goodness me! What is the matter with everyone this morning? A beat. He looks utterly fragile. DENIS I've told you what the matter is. The business is a bit rocky at the moment and the Doctor thinks I need a rest. MARGARET And do you need a rest? 
It's almost challenging. He doesn't answer and she doesn't notice. MARGARET (CONT'D) We both know that it's highly unlikely that I would ever be elected leader, I'll never be elected leader. But I will run. I will run. Just to nip at their heels and make them reaffirm the principles on which the Conservative Party must stand. There's so much to do. She smiles. DENIS (sotto voce) You're insufferable, Margaret, do you know that? MARGARET Denis, you married someone who is committed to public service, you knew that. And it is my duty - DENIS (interrupts) Don't call it duty. It's ambition which has got you this far. Ambition. And the rest of us, me, the children, we can all go to hell! The SLAM of the door, DENIS gone- 
DENIS (O.S.) (CONT'D) Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!

INT. KITCHEN. FLOOD STREET. LONDON. 1974. DAWN 
MARGARET eats breakfast alone, engrossed in the newspaper. 
DENIS (V.O.) How many days passed before you realized I was gone? Probably had to ask the cleaning woman where I was. 
INT. SITTING ROOM. CHESTER SQ. PRESENT. NIGHT 
MARGARET grips her whiskey, shaking her head. 
MARGARET When did I lose track of everyone?

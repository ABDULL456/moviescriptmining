TUGGER Hell I don't. BRENDAN The Pin's sitting on the brick profits - hitting him now would be post. Make peace and wait for your chance. 
LAURA He's right, Tug. Smooth it out. 
BRENDAN (between coughs) Besides, he's got you on the Dode thing. War'll mean you vs. him and every bull in the burgh. 
Tugger turns away, thinking. 
TUGGER Yeah, we'll talk. 
LAURA (to Brendan) You going? 
BRENDAN Yeah. 
She nods. Brendan stumbles into the bedroom. 
INT. TUGGER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Brendan lies on his back. Sweat stands on his forehead. 
THE FAN 
Spinning dizzily from Brendan's POV. Then the fan is still and the room is spinning, then the fan, then the room. Brendan clamps his eyes shut. A door creaks open. 
BRENDAN (croaks) Go away. 
Laura floats across the room to him. Her hair falls around him. Brendan shrinks back. She puts a pale hand on his clammy forehead. Brendan tries to speak, but cannot. 
He fingers slide over his face. She pulls off his glasses. 
Her hands all over his face. Brendan's throat contorts in a hard swallow. His eyes are wet. 
Her hair, her hands all warm and gentle, touching him. 
LAURA I'm sorry Brendan. 
Brendan breaks. In silent sobs first, then shivering with an almighty release he cries like a baby in her arms. 
THE FAN 
Spinning above them. 
Laura lights a cigarette. They lie beside each other. 
LAURA Don't go tonight. 
BRENDAN I've got to make sure it plays out smooth. 
LAURA It'll play however it plays without you there. 
BRENDAN I've got to make sure. 
LAURA Why? BRENDAN Cause if there's war, I'm in it too. 
LAURA Well let's just, I mean why not just run away. Go somewhere. I've got a car. (Brendan gives a wry look) I've got an aunt in New Orleans, she wouldn't care. (Brendan grins) Yeah, it's a stupid thing, but think about it, why not? What, school? C'mon. Family? 
BRENDAN Alright, stop. 
Her smoke drifts into the fan. LAURA I wasn't serious, but we could go for awhile. Just until everything clears. 
Brendan watches the smoke. She stubs the butt out in an ash tray on the table and curls against his chest. 
Stretching his arm across the table, he nonchalantly spins the ash tray around with his finger. 
His glasses lay on the table. Through the left lens the cigarette is magnified. Pale blue arrow on the filter. 
Laura's arm stretches across his chest. He looks at it, then up at the fan, spinning. 
LATER 
Brendan slips out of bed. A glowing clock radio reads 
INT. TUGGER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
A swarm of silent activity. Tug's flunkies prepare various weapons. Brendan goes to Tug. 
BRENDAN Tell your boys no knuckle business.

Hi.  I wanted to see how you were getting along. 
ED 
Getting along? 
GEOFFREY 
I have to say, you don't look well. 
ED 
I'm not well. 
GEOFFREY 
Have you slept? 
ED 
I don't know.  Maybe.  It's difficult to tell.  I have these lapses, but I'd hardly call it sleep. 
GEOFFREY 
Did you take the pills? 
ED 
The pills are fucking useless. 
GEOFFREY 
But you took them? 
ED 
Yes. 
GEOFFREY 
I see.  May I take your blood pressure? 
ED 
OK, fine. 
Geoffrey comes in and places his briefcase on the table. He takes a stethoscope and the rest of his blood pressure kit and starts to take Ed's blood pressure. 
ED 
I feel like a lab rat.  Like one of those lab rats they drug up and study.  You know what I mean? 
GEOFFREY 
You feel like a rat. 
ED 
They put them in a maze and they give them shocks and drugs and they see what they do. They try to prod them in the direction they want them to go. 
GEOFFREY 
Try to relax. 
ED 
I feel like a rat who took all the turns, took all the drugs, went down the right path and then, when I got to the end, they shocked me anyway, right up the sphincter, like it was all just a big joke. I guess they thought I'd be too drugged up to notice. 
GEOFFREY 
It's been a few days, hasn't it, since your wife disappeared? 
ED 
Days?  Yes.  I guess. 
GEOFFREY 
Has there been any word from the police? 
ED 
Haven't you talked to them? 
GEOFFREY 
No.  But if you'd like me to, I will, on your behalf.  They know me and I've been through this before. 
ED 
With others? 
GEOFFREY 
With others, and myself.  My wife was taken from me about three years ago. 
ED 
What happened? 
GEOFFREY 
It was a similar situation to yours. The police found her car in the parking lot of a mall. They found her body about a week later in some woods nearby. 
ED 
She was murdered. 
GEOFFREY 
Yes. 
ED 
Did they ever catch the man who did it? 
GEOFFREY 
No. 
ED

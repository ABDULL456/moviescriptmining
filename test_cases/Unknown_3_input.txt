LIZ 
(LOUD) Oh thank God you're here! Martin stares at her in horror as she beams up at him. One hand caressing his cheek... .her other hand pressing a knife against his chest. 
GINA Seeing Martin and Liz, embracing. Confused. Alarmed. Hurt. 
LIZ AND MARTIN Liz still hugging him tight, whispering hard, her free hand sliding something metallic into his pocket. 
LIZ (CONT'D) Hello, Martin. I just placed a gun in your jacket pocket. One bullet. There's really only one person, one right way to kill Bressler now, isn't there? The crazy man whose been stalking him, the crazy man who pretended to be Martin Harris... 
MARTIN No... 
LIZ Oh, and after you've shot him, point the gun at the Police. 
MARTIN I won't do it... 
LIZ God you're weak. The 'Martin' I knew wouldn't have been able to go on living like you are. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) Her eyes duck, purposeful, he tracks her gaze. Sees the Uzi in the sportsbag... 
LIZ (CONT'D) I'll kill them all. Bressler, the girls... your new girlfriend, and whoever tries to stop me. Look at it this way: I'm giving you a chance to save most of them. You can be the hero... A kiss, sexy. Gina in the background, taking a step back... 
LIZ (CONT'D) Ooops, bet you wish you could explain that. Time's up, Martin. Go finish what you came to Berlin for in the first place. On Martin. Caught. No play. He turns, walks... 
INT. BATHROOM, EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Martin B has a small hole opened up. He can see the digital timer. 00:00:14, 00:00:13... Jams his hand into the hole. Trying to force it past the narrow opening. Desperately feeling for the controls. 
INT. LOBBY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - CONTINUOUS 
Martin, on a suicide mission. Walks in a daze towards Gina, Bressler beyond. His hand moves into his pocket. Gina, stepping forward... 
GINA Martin...? Martin? He STARES at her. Tears in his eyes... 
REAR ENTRANCE TO THE LOBBY Strauss re-enters, commanding his security. STOPS as he recognizes Martin, mouths words to his men... 
INT. BATHROOM, EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Martin B, forcing his arm further. Fingers reach the controls... search for the right one... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: .his finger flips a small switch. The timer... STOPS. Martin B sighs, breathes hard. Holy shit that was close. 
INT. LOBBY, HOTEL IMPERIAL - CONTINUOUS 
Martin and Gina, locked, staring. Her face a million questions... No answers. Martin shakes his head, turns away from her, towards Bressler, his hand coming out of his pocket with the gun... In Martin's face: horror, deadly conviction... Time SLOOOWS. Sound AMPLIFIES... 
STRAUSS AND HIS MEN .Seeing the gun. Shouting! Weapons being drawn! 
GINA Also seeing the gun. A hand going out, a scream building... 
MARTIN Bringing the Vun up, pointed at Bressler's head, perfect kill shot. No choice. Finger on the trigger... 
INT. BATHROOM, EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Martin B stands, dusts off his coat, starts to walk out of the bathroom... "crunch" he steps on something. A soft "beep." He looks down, REACTS to: The remote control... under his foot. 
VISION RACKS TO THE BOMB: 00:00:02., 00:00:01... 
MARTIN B Fuck... 
KABOOM!!! WHITE OUT BLAST as the bomb DETONATES. Martin B atomized. Sheets of flame bursting through windows.

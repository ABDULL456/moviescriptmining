Bud stands by the door with Braddock. And Fitch steps forward, laughs nervously... 
FITCH Okay, great... Thanks. Thank you, Jesse, for that. And thank you, everyone for attending... (tight) Uh, we all know why we're here. To solve a matter of custody-- 
FBI #1 We'll protect you and your family, Jesse. (to the room) It's a federal matter, gentlemen. Those bodies were transported over state lines. 
An ATF AGENT #1 imposes: 
ATF #1 Not so fast. Ammunition, grenades? This man's house was a factory, for Christ's sake. ATF is taking this. 
DEA Those murders were drug related. DEA's got to do follow ups. 
SECRET SERVICE He was printing counterfeit money. That's Secret Service. 
ARGUING ENSUES, Agents' voices step over one another. Fitch tries to take control. Jesse's been silent, until... 
JESSE There's a hit list. 
Fitch hears this. He turns, loudly to the room... 
FITCH Wait! Wait a minute, quiet! Everyone quiet! 
And EVERYTHING stops. Fitch moves to Jesse: 
FITCH A what? 
JESSE A hit list. There's much as twelve. Might be one or two less now, I ain't sure. Some could've already been gotten. 
BUD (to Braddock) Now we're talkin'. 
FBI #2 approaches Jesse... 
FBI #2 Why these twelve, Jesse? 
JESSE Different reasons. It ain't so much why or what they done that matters. Pick any one of 'em off that list, AB puts you on salary. 
Everyone is suddenly interested. Bud sees this. 
JESSE And you, sir, if I ain't mistaken... You're Mr. Nokes, right? 
Agents part, revealing JOHN NOKES(50s), black, an emminent figurehead in a plush suit. Surprised to be pointed out... 
JESSE First U.S. Attorney, John Nokes? 
NOKES That's right. 
JESSE Well, last time I seen it...you was number two on that list. 
It's quiet. Nokes thinks. Then LAUGHS and approaches Jesse. 
NOKES Can you fill us in on the rest of those names, Jesse? 
JESSE Yes, I can. But there's something I gotta make clear 'fore that happens. 
NOKES What's that? 
JESSE I've listened to you, Mr. Nokes. And I've listened to these suits here, on who's gonna take me in... (beat) I will die, go to hell and take all y'all cocksuckers with me, if he-- (motions to Bud) --tells me to. (beat) I want y'all to know that. 
Jesse is explosive under the low projection delivery and a CHILL falls over the room. 
NOKES (to Bud) How's that fly by you, Lieutenant? 
Bud simply nods. 
NOKES I'll sponsor him. Jesse's welfare will come out of our budget. Anyone has pending cases or leads for Jesse, see me. I'll loan him out. 
Jesse stares at Nokes. As the meeting settles back to a comfortable level... 
NOKES And, Jesse... I'm a little pissed I'm number two on that list. Who the fuck is number one? 
The room erupts with LAUGHTER. Everyone except Bud and Jesse. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GRAND COUTEAU - DAY 
Jesse's truck moves over an old wooden bridge through sweeping fields that stretch to a vast, wooded area. 
EXT. FRONT GATES, PRIVATE PROPERTY - DAY 
Jesse stops at a long drive protected by locked iron gates. 
A surveillance camera zooms in. Jesse looks up. A second camera pans on Jesse, staring... 
MOVE IN as crackling, electronic pixels FILL THE FRAME and... 
CUT TO: 
INT. GUARD STATION - SAME 
A BANK OF MONITORS showing Jesse at the gates. A GUARD sits in shadow, hits a button: We see the gates unlock and open. 
INT. JESSE'S TRUCK 
pulls down the private road. 
Shafts of light mottle then burst, REVEALING an elegant VICTORIAN HOME.

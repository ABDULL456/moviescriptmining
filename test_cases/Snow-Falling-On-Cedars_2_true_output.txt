...AT the rail, through the POPPING of flashbulbs, she is IN his arms, the embrace so FIERCE on both sides, everyone crowding around them. 
An old man's eyes sweep the gallery, looking for someone.  Only to find... 
...Ishmael's back.  As he disappears through the door. 
INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - LATER 
The Miyamotos holding court, surrounded by nearly twenty reporters and photographers, and countless looky-loo's of all persuasions. Hatsue's face is flushed and intense, unsmiling, she seems scarcely to have caught her breath.  She holds tight to her husband's hand, as he... 
...carries his baby son in the other arm, his 8-year-old daughter leaning against him, her 4-year-old sister standing on the bench beside her mom.  Kabuo submits to questions with a boyish grin of humility and friendliness.  An American family.  Photogenic as hell. 
REPORTER #1 And how about the jury?  You had confidence they'd see justice done? 
Kabuo glances to his lawyer, wanna field this one?  But Nels sends it back with a twinkle. 
KABUO Oh, sure.  These are our neighbors, you know.  They've got good hearts.  We could see they were following the evidence real close... 
At his side, Hatsue seems to be scanning the jumble of faces... 
KABUO We're just grateful to every one of them. 
...looking for something she doesn't find. 
REPORTER #2 And you ma'am?  You felt the same as your husband, I expect? 
Her eyes move to the eager young man.  She reflects for a beat. 
HATSUE Honestly, no. 
Which catches everyone.  A little short. 
HATSUE (quietly) I felt my husband would be found guilty.  Unless proven innocent. 
No apologies for the truth.  That's not her way. 
HATSUE And Mr. Chambers did that. 
INT. COURTHOUSE BASEMENT 
A vending machine stands in silence.  The eerie strobing glow of defective neon.  PULL BACK as... 
Ishmael thinks it over.  Drops in his dime.  Pulls the plunger, to watch a Snickers fall.  Scoops the candy from the tray, pins it between his body and the machine. 
...tears the wrapper. 
INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR 
BACK to the reporters.  The crowd of onlookers has grown. 
REPORTER #3 ...can we get some background on your handsome family?  I understand you two were childhood sweethearts... 
And brings his Parker pen to his notepad.  His subject smiles easily... 
KABUO Well, no sir, not exactly.  We met in the Manzanar camp, you see, so I guess that was the most beautiful place I've ever been. 
There is gentle laughter.  And as Kabuo looks up, he sees something in the rear of the crowd.  Something we do not.  And softly... 
KABUO No, her first love was another fella... 
Which brings Hatsue's eyes up, following his gaze.  And there, in the back.  A man watches.  Eating a candy bar. 
KABUO (O.S.) I was the lucky one. 
No one sees their eyes lock.  It is only an instant. 
It is enough. 
REPORTER #4 It all sounds very romantic, ma'am.  Falling in love under those circumstances... 
And as she looks to the reporter, Ishmael begins to walk away... 
HATSUE He went off to the Army, right from Manzanar.  And that last night, we danced alone in the desert... 
And somehow, Ishmael catches the eye of Hatsue's 4-year-old daughter.  So he pulls a coin from his pocket... 
HATSUE (O.S.) I told him.  If you don't come back alive, I'll kill you. 
...Ishmael ROLLS the coin across his knuckles.  And the child responds... 
With her mother's smile. 
EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DUSK 
Alone on the steps where the Strawberry Princess once winked at him.  Snow has begun to fall, soft and altogether beautiful.  He squints up... 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) God's kindness, my father said. Despite the hardship...it reminds us.  Of our place in things. 
Our place in things.  He slides a black cigar between his teeth... 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) What the hell.  Did he mean by that? 
He has the match box.  Manipulating it with the dexterity we've come to know. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) Things fall on us, I suppose. From the sky. 
STRIKES the match on his belt buckle... 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) Wars.  Freighters plowing through... 
Cupping it expertly in a single motion, he brings the flame to the cigar.  A single puff. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) And we seem...helpless.  Until we understand. 
One more.  Savors it.  The sky.  The thought. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) Accident rules every corner of the universe... 
Down the steps.  Snow swirling between us.  Gone. 
ISHMAEL (V.O.) Except the chambers.  Of the human heart.

Bob looks from one to the other and their smiling shyness indicates pregnancy. 
BOB You're kidding! 
SYLVIA We don't want anyone else to know. 
ALBERT Please don't mention it. (The orchestra starts to play ROCKABYE BABY.  Sylvia and Albert are startled) For heaven's sake! 
SYLVIA How did they know? 
The girls start crowding around. 
GIRLS (Ad libbing) You wouldn't tell us, would you?  We had to find out ourselves, etc. (Phil and Judy are among the group) 
MARTHA (Formally) There will be a celebration of the forthcoming event tonight after the show! (Everyone approves) 
MED. SHOT - BOB, PHIL AND ALBERT 
Phil puts his arm around Albert. 
PHIL Obviously you're going to call the boy after me! 
BOB After you?  I hired Sylvia!  The baby'll be named after me! 
PHIL I've been dancing with her!  That's more important!  The baby'll be named after me! 
BOB The hiring was more important!  After me! 
PHIL The dancing was more important! After me! 
ALBERT I'm her husband. (Small pause) The baby'll be named after me. 
BOB Well, we're going to need another dancer! 
PHIL How about Judy, she knows all the routines, she could pick it up in no time. 
They walk to the table where the coffee is, and the group now includes Betty. 
BOB On the other hand, it's all right if we lose a number, we're running too long now.  We have to cut somewhere. 
BETTY Wouldn't it be better if you cut my solo number?  I've never felt right in it anyway. (Indicating Phil) The show needs every bit of his dancing. 
BOB (Interpreting this as mere selflessness for love) Well - 
BETTY There you are - painless. 
She turns away rather abruptly, since she is becoming emotional.  Bob shakes his head, impressed with what he thinks is her devotion. 
MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT - BOB AND PHIL 
Bob dunks a doughnut into his coffee as he looks after Betty. He looks at Phil and shakes his head. 
BOB Greater love hath no woman than to give up a solo number.  Old Chinese saying. 
PHIL (All this is beyond him) What are you talking about? 
BOB Drink your coffee. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
FULL SHOT - WAVERLY QUARTERS - (NIGHT)

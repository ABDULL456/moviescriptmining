ROPER That a new picture? 
RONNIE About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style. 
Roper gazes at it indifferently. He falls silent. Thoughts turned inward. Suddenly, TROY, (the dog), bounds in. He's ecstatic to see Roper. He puts his front paws on the couch and his head in Roper's lap. 
ROPER Hey, Troy. How ya doin' boy? (to Ronnie) He heard my voice. 
Roper smiles briefly, pats the dog, taking comfort from his presence. His words are light. His tone isn't. 
ROPER How's the good dog. I miss you buddy. You miss me? 
Ronnie watches them, suddenly showing the sadness she's carefully buried. 
ROPER He misses me. 
She nods. A moment's silence. 
ROPER I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone. 
RONNIE (a bit surprised at his openness) You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting. 
ROPER It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him. 
RONNIE Scott, You can't save everyone. 
ROPER I've proved that, didn't I? 
She's not coming closer. She wants to, but she won't do it. She seems uneasy, glances towards the door. Roper rises. 
ROPER Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work. 
RONNIE (gentle) What do you want from me? 
ROPER Something I guess I can't have anymore. 
RONNIE Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again. 
ROPER (surprised, hurt) You think I didn't need you? 
RONNIE If you did, you never showed it. 
ROPER Ronnie... 
He reaches for her and she looks like she might give in to him, but at that moment there's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Ronnie pulls back, confused and guilty. 
ROPER You expecting someone? 
Her silence is the answer... A flash of pain from Roper. 
ROPER This day just keeps getting better. 
Ronnie watches as he searches for his keys in his pockets. 
RONNIE (soft) They're on the table where you always leave them. 
He grabs the keys as she opens the door. GREG stands outside waiting. He's a big, good looking guy with a smile on his face. 
GREG Hey, baby, I thought maybe you were... 
Greg's smile fades as he sees Roper. 
ROPER I was just leaving. 
Roper strides past Greg who remains in the doorway. Ronnie makes brief eye contact with Greg, but then moves past him to follow Roper. She calls after him. 
RONNIE Scottie... take care of yourself. 
Roper doesn't look back. He just goes. 
EXT. PIER 26 - EARLY MORNING 
A huge warehouse. Sun coming up over the East Bay, CLARENCE TEAL rides up on a HARLEY MOTORCYLE, carrying a large cup of coffee to go. He enters the warehouse. 
INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME 
Car and Boat parts stacked in aisles ten feet high. Clarence shuffles through to his watchman's quarters which are connected to the end of the warehouse. 
INT. WATCHMAN'S QUARTERS - SAME 
Built on pilings with a panoramic view of the bay. Korda is waiting behind the door as Clarence enters. He seizes Clarence from behind and slams him against the wall and spins him around. Hot coffee soaks the front of Clarence's shirt. 
KORDA If you weren't family I'd kill you. 
Clarence is scared. He offers no defense. 
KORDA You told Antonucci that shit came from me. 
CLARENCE So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike. 
Korda tosses Clarence down onto the cot. 
KORDA You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement. 
CLARENCE I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off. 
KORDA Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door! 
CLARENCE What happened, Mike. 
KORDA You don't want to know. 
Tears start to come to Clarence's eyes. 
CLARENCE I'm sorry, Mike.

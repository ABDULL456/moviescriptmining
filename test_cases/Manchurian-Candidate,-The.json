Scuffing of feet.   Somebody coughs.       1 \nMARCO'S VOICE \nApproximately sixty four hundred hours before Desert Storm, we were on a routine recon inside Iraqi-controlled terrain, assessing troop strength for what Saddam Hussein promised to be the mother of all wars ... but turned out to be just a little warm up for the whomping he got a few years later. \nFADE IN: \n2   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                           2 \nPROWLING ACROSS undulating land dotted with BURNING OIL WELLS that give the vague impression of, well, hell. The inky sky is awash with stars. \nON THE CREST OF A DUNE \nA U.S. ARMY BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE and matching HUMMER sit, waiting. \nKUWAIT, 1991 \nMuffled THUMP of rap music thrums from the Bradley, and low voices stray from the open doors of the Hummer. \nMARCO (O.S.) \nWhy can't we go directly in ... \n3   INT./EXT. THE HUMMER - NIGHT                                  3 \nA topographical MAP glows on the LCD screen of a laptop portable, faintly lighting the faces of CAPT. BEN MARCO and his big, gentle, French guide, LAURENT TOKAR. \nMARCO \n(pointing) ... this way --? \nLAURENT \nYes, well -- I see the Captain enjoys the road less travelled. Marco is seemingly unflappable, completely engaged by life. \nMARCO \nThe Captain enjoys not dragging his ass down the highway for every Tom, Dick and Qadhafi to take a whack at. Laurent swings his finger on the arc of approach. \nLAURENT \nWell. Of course it is very bad, here. And here. And here, here, here, here -- \nMARCO \nMines? \nLAURENT \nTricky.    Swedish-made. \nMARCO \nDammit. He refers to some satellite surveillance maps -- \nMARCO \nNobody at Command said anything about -- \nLAURENT \nExxon and Global Petroleum hired private contractors to do the work in '86, as part of their asset security program. (beat) Hired an Iraqi firm, in fact, who, now, well -- only they know where the little Nordic fuckers are planted. \nMARCO \n(turns away) Sgt. Shaw! No response. And we RUSH TOWARD: A SOLDIER IN A LAWN CHAIR, face lifted to the heavens, sitting directly between the two armored vehicles. This is SGT. RAYMOND PRENTISS SHAW, late twenties, haunted and aloof. \nMARCO \n(suddenly behind him) Sergeant. \nRAYMOND \nSir. \nMARCO \nRolling in two minutes. \nRAYMOND \nYes sir. Beat. \nMARCO \nEverything okay? \nRAYMOND \nYes, Captain. Everything's fine.   Here. (standing up) I'll \"rally\" the troops. \n4   INT. THE BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE - NIGHT                     4 \nMUSIC blares around eight soldiers, including wiseguy PFC. ED MAVOLE, crowded into space designed for four -- \nMAVOLE \nYo Melvin. You gonna play that hand, or hatch it? -- CPL. AL MELVIN grunts, then they all look up, almost in unison, at Raymond when he swings open the back door. PFC. BOBBY BAKER, a slender man, barely eighteen, a driver, ejects a CD from the onboard stereo. Silence. \nRAYMOND \nWe're moving out. Beat.   He shuts the door again. \n5   EXT. THE BRADLEY - NIGHT                                      5 \nRaymond waits. Another beat.     Then some LAUGHTER from inside the vehicle. He shifts his shoulders, walks back into the darkness. \n24   OMITTED                                                            24 \n25   THE ROCKET hits the Bradley Fighting Vehicle at a slant into       25 its exposed belly, and the truck EXPLODES -- Marco's team scattering, pressing themselves into the sand, covering their heads -- \nA BOY'S VOICE \n(amplified) Were you scared? THICK DARK SMOKE momentarily blankets the road.    Silence. \nFLASH FORWARD: A YOUNG BOY SCOUT - DAY                             26 \nwaiting for an answer, stares earnestly upward at: \nFLASH FORWARD: MAJOR BEN MARCO - DAY \nbehind a podium, in his crisp dress uniform.    His current self: older, tired. Lost for a moment. \nMARCO \nScared? (long beat) You don't really have time to be scared. Uneasy rustling of an o.s. audience. Somebody coughs.         An air-conditioner KICKS IN, rumbling, becoming -- \n27   EXT. THE KUWAITI HIGHWAY - NIGHT - MARCO                        27 \nraises his head.   SEES: -- the Bradley, in flames. -- the Hummer, on its side in the ditch, headlights aglow -- -- shadows of enemy soldiers, retreating across the dunes. -- MILITARY HELICOPTERS materializing out of the smoke and darkness ... circling ... NO SOUND -- \nMARCO (V.O.) \nI couldn't hear anything, as I was temporarily deaf from the explosion of the Bradley ... -- SOLDIERS WITH GAS MASKS lean out of the open doors of the helicopters and drop GAS CANISTERS down on Marco's team. \nIN SLOWING MOTION: \n28   MARCO'S SQUAD -- the effect of the gas is immediate: Mavole     28 collapses in his tracks. Melvin points a gun skyward and FIRES a burst that goes harmlessly wide of a helicopter. Then he falls on his back. HEAVY, LUMINOUS, YELLOW-ORANGE VAPOR swirls across the battle -- WITH MARCO -- his shirt pulled up over his mouth and nose, he wheels to get away from the drifting gas, feet unsteady. Grabs a dazed Bobby Baker by the collar -- \nMARCO \nI got your back, Baker.   I got ... -- and tries to pull him to safety ... knees buckling ... he looks up: 29   MARCO'S P.O.V. - THE HUMMER -- is no   longer stalled on its    29 side in the ditch, but improbably is   righted again, back on four wheels and attacking. A vision    of Raymond behind the machine gun, firing at the advancing   enemy -- WITH MARCO -- trying to process this.    Coughing.   Fading. \n30   OMITTED                                                         30 \nFLASH FORWARD: MAJOR BEN MARCO                                  31 \nBehind the podium.   Takes a sip of water, then: \nMARCO \n-- and with complete disregard for his own life and safety, Sgt.

HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS                       36 \nA Boy Scout luncheon banquet. \nWASHINGTON D.C., NOW \nA full chicken buffet table, banners, flags, and over one hundred SCOUTS, LEADERS and DADS, all looking somewhat attentively up at the guest speaker, U.S. Army Major Ben Marco. \nMARCO \nLike Edmonds in Korea, Holderman in Viet Nam, Raymond Shaw was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. I signed the recommendation myself. A hand shoots up.    Marco nods toward it. \nANOTHER SCOUT \nWere you wounded? \nMARCO \nI was -- \nFB36   FLASH: MARCO ON THE KUWAITI TWO-LANE                        FB36 \nTurning away from the overturned Humvee, and right into a head-high rifle-butt swung by the hands and arms of a gas mask-wearing figure. \nRESUME - AUDITORIUM - MARCO \nHe blinks. \nMARCO \n-- injured. I fell, had a, uh, concussion -- lost focus -- Sgt. Shaw took command -- A disheveled man comes into the back of the room noisily, as: \nSCOUT DAD \nDid your unit sustain any casualties? \nMARCO \nOkay.   Okay. Well, look, Al, I gotta -- \nMELVIN \nGo. \nMARCO \n-- run, yeah. But. (awkward) It was great seeing you.   And good luck to you. Melvin just scowls sadly at Marco. Flash of glass, a door opens and closes, and Marco is gone. \n38   EXT. H.S. PARKING LOT - DAY                                    38 \nMarco is motionless in his car, head resting against the steering wheel. He straightens up, with a thousand-yard stare. His hands are trembling. Slowly, he grips the steering wheel ... tighter and tighter ... until the trembling stops. \n39     INT. SUPERMARKET - CHECK-OUT COUNTER - NIGHT                      39 \nA pretty CASHIER (ROSIE) empties Marco's basket: bottled water, three romance novels, a bottle of No-Doz, a bag of tomatoes and two dozen boxes of instant noodles. \n40     INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                        40 \nMarco comes up the stairs with his groceries. An ELDERLY WOMAN sticks her head out from her apartment door: \nWOMAN \n-- Thirty seven. Marco stops, looks at her blankly. \nWOMAN \nFrom the landing. Every week it gets longer. I'm worried about you. He takes the romance novels out of his grocery bag and hands them to her. \nMARCO \nFrom the landing. Every week it gets longer. I'm worried about you. He takes the romance novels out of his grocery bag and hands them to her. \nMARCO \nNone of these involve slave traders or sheiks, Abby. I checked. \nWOMAN \n(blushes) What do I owe you? \nMARCO \n(sad) A smile. She does. \n41     INT. MARCO'S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT                             41 \nHe enters, and a visible exhaustion overtakes him.

Which he swallows dry. \nROVING REPORTER \n-- the American people are looking for a new agenda -- but because this party remains deeply divided on so many issues, the choice of a vice presidential nominee may be the key unifying factor for the delegates of this convention in much the way Johnson helped Kennedy in 1960 ... Then he's up on his feet, moving to the kitchen through the small, cramped space overflowing with books, unopened boxes from Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble. \n42     INT. MARCO'S APARTMENT - LATER                                 42 \nMarco sits at a clearing on the tiny kitchen table, eating instant noodles and trying to read Prizzi's Honor. \nTV42                       VOICE/JORDAN                              TV42 \n(on the t.v.) We need to look inward -- attend to our own house -- the danger to our country is not from some terrorists at large -- terrorists we've helped engender with twenty years of failed foreign policy -- An open cabinet door behind Marco reveals ROWS AND ROWS OF INSTANT NOODLES in the cupboard. \nON THE TELEVISION \nNews coverage, the crowded floor of a political convention. A poised, silvery, avuncular man, SENATOR THOMAS JORDAN (according to the title on the screen) on the podium: \nJORDAN \n-- no, the real danger is from suspending civil liberties, gutting the Bill of Rights, allowing our fear to destroy our democratic ideals -- \n43     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT                                       43 \nThe same speech continues, largely ignored by Congressman RAYMOND PRENTISS SHAW. Still intense and moody, the new \nRaymond Shaw's suit is expensive and crisp, his hair perfect. He's playing solitaire. And winning. \nRAYMOND \n(murmurs) ... I am not a professional politician. I am not a professional politician ... \nTV43                       JORDAN (T.V.)

KNOCKING on his door -- it opens, and Secret Service AGENT EVAN ANDERSON removes his key while SEN. ELEANOR SHAW, pretty and ageless, sweeps in -- closing the door on her aide (GILLESPIE) -- \nELLIE \nRaymond? Darling, what were you going to do, make me stand out there like room service? -- soft curves conceal razor claws and titanium backbone -- she kisses her son on the lips, straightens his collar, his tie, lets her hands smooth his shirt to his chest for a little too long, and never stops talking: \nYou gave them every opportunity to do the right thing, Senator. \nELLIE \n(glances at him) No. I gave them one opportunity. And that was unusually generous of me. She pushes through a door, and into -- \n48   INT. CONVENTION BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                       48 \nRaymond's speech plays, low, on a television, and half a dozen DELEGATES and POWER PLAYERS with \"Arthur For President\" buttons grimly watch Ellie breeze in. Party Chairman VAUGHN UTLY anticipates her: \nUTLY \nThe decision is final, Senator. Tom Jordan is on the ticket. We don't need your blessing, but we'd like it. \nELLIE \n(smiling:) Before we get started, I'm dying to know: which genius here hatched the scheme of pairing a Sound Bite from Nebraska with a relic who thinks keeping suicide bombers off our busses is unconstitutional? \nUTLY \nAll the research indicates that an Arthur- Jordan ticket sits quite well with the American public and -- \nELLIE \n'Sits quite well' translates into how many votes? \nSENATOR WELLS \nYour son is largely unknown outside of New York. His public service, his Congressional record, while commendable, is -- \nELLIE \nMy son is a war hero. \nCONGRESSMAN FLORES \n(cheerful) Governor Arthur has agreed to consider Raymond for a cabinet post. A cold silence.   Ellie stands -- \nELLIE \nWe didn't come here to have a discussion. \nUTLY                            ELLIE \nSenator --                          (to her posse) Did we come here to have a discussion? \nSENATOR WELLS \nEllie, you don't have the votes to block this, or even push the nomination to a second ballot. \nELLIE \n(ignores him) Even running against this cut-and-fold vice president, with his party's record of abysmal failure at home and abroad, Arthur is still unelectable without help. (cold, hard logic:) Consider. The Governor is a corn-belt candidate who -- scratch and sniff -- looks and smells alot like the kind of liberal-labor-intellectual Dukakis was, but without, thank God, the helmet. (beat) Assume our intrepid Arthur can carry the Northeast, plus his home ground, and California. We're still dead in the South, and Southwest, where they win by landslides. The mid-central is a toss- up. Tom Jordan actually becomes a liability in Florida because of his Castro-appeasement profile, and in the Carolinas, where he fumbles the military vote over his \"terrorism isn't a war it's a social disease\" nonsense. The room is surreally silent. Ellie spins and moves like a televangelist, preaching to the frightened faithful. \nELLIE \nYou know this. Your own polls and surveys back me up. (beat) You're counting on Jordan to help you get the black vote, women, college kids -- my gut instinct says he won't -- and Arthur holding the center -- where he's soft at best. And who's to say the President won't throw troops into another third- world skirmish, pushing his sidekick's approval ratings up into the eighties again, and the campaign off the front pages? \nUTLY \nWe're confident this is a winning ticket, Ellie. \nELLIE \nWhat's your margin of error? Five points? Three? (beat) I can swing that, and you know it. I can swing seven away from you -- more than enough to split the party and -- \nSENATOR WELLS \n(over her) -- and deny us the White House for four more years? No. Not even you would do that, Senator. You're bluffing. Ellie stares at them. OUTSIDE, SUDDENLY: the marching band begins playing \"It's a Grand Old Flag,\" and hurries out onto the ROARING convention floor ... \nELLIE \nAmerica is facing the greatest test of its history, gentlemen. Not just from terrorist organizations both outside and within our borders, but from covert alliances of disaffected nations so terrified of winding up on our shit list they believe the only way to protect themselves is to hit us with everything they can find before we get around to them. Am I the only one in this room paying attention to the NSA reports? We are on the brink of nuclear cataclysm, on our own soil, while our policies remain shackled by Jordan-style One Worlders who insist that human beings are essentially Good ... and that Power is something shameful, and Evil. (then) Make no mistake, the people of this great country are frightened. They know what's coming. They can feel it. And we can shovel them the same old shit and call it sugar, or arm them, with a young, vibrant, populist congressman, a war hero with heart -- forged by enemy fire, in the desert, in the dark, when American lives hung in the balance. \n49   INT.

Hell, he's probably the kindest, bravest, warmest, most selfless human being I've ever known. Marco reacts to the image of Melvin from ten years ago: young, engaging, eyes alive -- Marco's lips move in sync with words of Melvin's statement ('bravest, warmest' 'selfless' 'ever known') -- as if he knows it by heart -- his mind shifting -- \nMEDIA ICON \nThe war hero who dedicated himself to public service after Desert Storm ... PUSH IN on Marco.   His eyes distant, glazed -- tranced: \nNOYLE (O.S.) \nAnd at the instant he completes this, or any task, Raymond has already forgotten that he has ever been involved in it.

HOWARD \nYou're off your meds, sleep-deprived, you have an unexpected encounter with a member of your Gulf War recon team, Al Melvin, who mentions some dreams he's been having -- \nMARCO \nDreams like mine. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \n(ignores) -- and suddenly your own bad dreams come charging back. Made worse by your chronic fear of them. Add in all the recent campaign news about Congressman Shaw, which is obviously rekindling your feelings of guilt and jealousy -- \nMARCO \n-- I'm not jealous of Raymond Shaw, sir. \nLT. COL.

Holding back what he's thinking. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nLook, we've been over this a million times. Until you forgive yourself for what happened that night in Kuwait, the loss of your men -- for what you did, for what you didn't do ... No reaction from Marco.    The Lt. Colonel sighs. \nLT. COL.

Raymond flashes a dazzling Kennedyesque smile, as the men chuckle appreciatively. \nELLIE \nThe plucky idealist. \nEllie glides off, unfazed.    The men banter on: \nRAYMOND \nGentlemen, how's business? \nWHITING \nGood, Raymond. Business is good. \nJOHNSTON \nCould always be better. \nRAYMOND \nCareful. Any better, you'll be a monopoly. \nDONOVAN \nThere's the challenge. Maximizing the market share and potential of a company. \nWHITING \nOr a country. Off their shared, collegial laughter -- \nACROSS THE ROOM - MARCO - MONETS LATER \nwatches Raymond take his leave from the Manchurian Global guys -- while, at the bar, the generals have established their beachhead of Bloody Marys with a couple of younger men in NAVY WHITES: \nREAR ADMIRAL GLICK \nEvery great civilization has been anchored by a great Navy. \nGENERAL SLOAN \nBullshit. You guys are sea chum, ripe for some raghead with a rocket launcher to put a hole in your bucket. Marco laughs deliberately, trying to diffuse the tension. \nMARCO \n(low) If you can't behave yourselves, Generals, we're gonna spend the rest of the day watching the Orioles game back at the hotel. Whereupon Raymond parades past, with his Secret Service handlers, oblivious to Ben until he calls out. \nMARCO \nCongressman -- Sergeant Shaw -- Raymond turning, but not stopping -- \nMARCO \nBen Marco. \nRAYMOND \nI know. (strange, dreamy) Hello Captain. \nMARCO                              RAYMOND \nIt's Major, and --                     (as if it surprises him:) I need to talk to you. But he keeps walking -- \nMARCO \n-- okay. -- Marco frowns, watches Raymond weave through the crowd towards Jocie, at the entrance. Marco follows, passing: \nELLIE AND JORDAN \nlocked in fierce, low battle, off to one side, voices hard, rising out of the din: \nJORDAN \n-- the political extortion you committed in order to destroy my vice presidential bid so that -- \nELLIE \nTom. \nJORDAN \n-- so that you might vicariously bask in reflected limelight from your son -- \nELLIE \n(overlapping) Tom, please, just because the party felt a younger, more dynamic man could help the ticket, I don't think it's fair for you to single me out and -- \nJORDAN \nYou know, I have such contempt for you, Eleanor, that when I think of you, I actually fear for this country. Raymond is nothing. A riddle. A wild card at worst. But you, you are the smiler who wraps her dagger in the cloak of the flag and waits for her chance to strike. Which I pray will never come. He wheels away -- \n64   OMITTED                                                        64 \n65   EXT. BOTANICAL GARDENS - ENTRANCE - MARCO                      65 \nhas found Raymond with Jocie -- outside -- but hangs back -- overhearing Raymond's earnest and intense conversation with Jocie, who is slightly uncomfortable with this but trying to make light of it -- \nJOCELYN \n... but Raymond, my God, it's been so many years -- I've been married and divorced -- \nRAYMOND \nI've changed too. \nJOCELYN \nThat's not what I -- but, yes, it's great, really -- I see that you have -- congratulations -- \nRAYMOND \n(from notes he's made) Owens died of cancer in '97. Villalobos, a car crash. Atkins committed suicide. Jamison was at the Pentagon, 9-11, body never recovered. Wilson I'm still trying to track down. Garret and Howard trade looks. \nMARCO \nSir, I know I can't ask you to talk to Congressman Shaw, not yet, but Al Melvin, it's a phone call, a quick q&a -- look at his notebooks, hear what he's been dreaming -- and either he will support the credibility of what I'm saying, or he won't. And I'll shut up. \nCOLONEL GARRET \nAnd what is it you are saying, exactly, Major? That you misrepresented -- falsified -- what happened In Kuwait? About the Medal of Honor? In effect, committed perjury. \nMARCO \nIf you just talk to Melvin -- \nCOLONEL GARRET \n(ignores) -- No, no, I'm sorry -- you're saying an entire squad of U.S. Army soldiers was hypnotized into believing that Raymond Shaw deserved the Medal of Honor. And somehow you're the only one who knows the truth. Silence.   Marco looks down at his hands. \nCOLONEL GARRET \nMajor Marco. You will stay clear of Congressman Shaw. \nMARCO \nYes sir. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nAnd you will resume your meds, Major. That is an order. \nMARCO \nYes sir. Beat.   Marco stands up, to leave, but -- \nCOLONEL GARRET \nMajor, do you ever take a step back and consider why you've remained at rank for all these years? Missed Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraqi Freedom. While men of lesser promise and inferior talent have enjoyed the fruits of those campaigns and moved beyond you? \nMARCO \nEvery day, sir. \n67     INT. STAGE - VICE-PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE (VIDEO)                 67 \nFAVOR Raymond, at a podium, his VICE PRESIDENTIAL OPPONENT slightly out of focus at his identical podium in the near b.g., mid-rebuttal: \nTV67                        V.P. OPPONENT                           TV67 \n... there are still VRF terrorists in Sierra Leone, new terrorist alliances forming in many parts of Asia and South America -- we can't simply, suddenly relinquish our commitment to world leaders who have stood by us. \nT.V.

MARCO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                68 \nMarco on his phone, the t.v. blaring, under: \nMARCO \n(on the phone) Hello, Victor? Marco. How's it goin'? (listens) Public affairs sucks, my friend. I miss you guys. Listen, favor: guy from my old unit, Melvin, Alfred R. -- I need an \n(MORE) \nMARCO (CONT'D) \naddress on him, I think he's here in D.C. ... yeah, go ahead.

And she's thinking: I can pay for my medicine, or I can pay for my dinner. I can't do both. In America. In America, our mothers and grandmothers shouldn't have to worry about that. VOICE on the other end of Marco's call, but he's slow to respond -- mesmerized by the \"new\" Raymond -- \nMARCO \n(on the phone) Yeah, yeah. I'm here ... As he starts to write an address -- \n69     OMITTED                                                         69 \n70     EXT.

Arthur and Raymond Shaw and the ARTHUR/SHAW \"SECURE TOMORROW\" campaign icon -- it SLIDES away, revealing: MARCO -- crosses the street, walks along a row of dilapidated apartments -- \nRAYMOND (V.O.) \n... the gap between rich and poor, between government and people -- -- the area is desolate, depopulated, an economic wasteland. Under a crumbling awning and into \n71     INT.

SKID ROW HOTEL CORRIDOR                                   72 \nAt the far end of a long and gloomy hallway, we can see Marco arrive at the door to Melvin's room. He hesitates, then knocks -- \nMARCO \nAl?   Al Melvin, it's Marco ... Nothing. He looks at his watch, turns, walks back down the narrow, high-ceilinged corridor -- haunting sounds of radios and televisions and broken conversations -- he disappears down the stairs -- \n73   INT. FANCY HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                              73 \nRaymond comes down the brightly-lit, elegant hallway, tired, trailing Anderson and his SECRET SERVICE entourage. \n78   INT. BATHROOM                                                 78 \nDouble sinks, walk-in shower, and a huge closet which Raymond opens to reveal -- \n79   INT.

Raymond just watching as he places a small clam-shell video screen open on the counter -- we can SEE a B&W surveillance view of the CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RAYMOND'S ROOM, with Anderson sitting the night watch, reading. The man gestures Raymond through the closet passageway -- \n80   INT. A HUGE ROOM BESIDE RAYMOND'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS          80 \n-- where Raymond is met by TECHNICIANS in sterile gear, surgical gloves. He's entered some kind of portable, surreal operating theater, filled with monitoring device and computers ... a one-way video-conference camera is aimed at a big examination chair in one corner, surrounded by I.V. racks and more techno-medical equipment. The man who is obviously in charge here, starts a digital timer and turns to face Raymond. It's NOYLE. \nNOYLE \nHello Raymond. Do you remember me? \nRAYMOND \nNo sir. \nNOYLE \nBrilliant. (to his group) We have twenty minutes for our little check up from the neck up. \n81   EXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT                                        81 \nMarco on a public phone, across the street from Melvin's residential hotel. Shaken. \nMARCO \nMy God. I'm sorry to hear that. When did it ... (listens) Yeah, I know. I know. (deep breath) Listen, Mrs. Wilson -- can you tell me if Nathan was ever -- preoccupied -- with his experience in Kuwait? Did he ever mention dreams or nightmares ... about what happened ... the firefight, afterward ... (beat) -- uh-huh. Sure. No, I understand. (beat) Thank you for -- Dial tone.   He hangs up.   Exhales. \nBLINK. \n82    Marco listening to the phone on the other end of his call      82 ring, and ring and ring. Dull HISS of the city. \nBLINK. \n83    Another call.                                                   83 \nMARCO (O.S.) \n... no, Mr. Villalobos, I'm just -- Army's got me running statistics on stress disorders, I'm trying to gather information on my old squad members ... yes sir -- \nA84   INT. NOYLE'S HIDDEN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                         A84 \nRaymond sits in a chair, rigged up with wires and tubes (much like he was ten years ago) -- a TRANSLUCENT BOX around his face overlaid with a METRIC GRID, his head held motionless by a semi-circular BRACE, curved calibration offering precise positioning for a MICRO-DRILL that Noyle moves into place -- and then a long, tiny drill bit WHIRS DOWN through STERILE LATEX stretched very tight across Raymond's head -- -- and plunges precisely and effortlessly through Raymond's skull, then STOPS -- he has no reaction, feels nothing -- LCD screens -- show a VIRTUAL MAP OF RAYMOND'S BRAIN, in a full range of primary colors -- sections morphing as thoughts and memories race through his mind, as MINISCULE, INTERWOVEN WIRES -- are threaded down through the HOLLOW core of the surgical drill, deep into Raymond's brain. Noyle plays to one of the cameras: \nNOYLE \nNo decay, no slippage. Everything appears to be in flawless working condition. (then) Raymond can you remember the deaths of Mavole and Baker? \nRAYMOND \nYes. The LCD SCREENS show activity in areas of Raymond's brain. \nNOYLE \nDescribe it. \n84   INT. SKID ROW RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT                           84 \nMarco knocking at Melvin's door again. \nMARCO \n... Al?   You in there? Still nothing. He checks the hallway, takes an Army utility knife from his pocket and forces the lock -- \n85   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   85 \nThe light switch doesn't work. Click, click. Eerie shudder of neon from the sign on the building, shapes crowd the room, claustrophobic ... ... Marco has a PENLIGHT -- he turns it on, sweeps in front of him with its weak beam: THE ROOM -- stacked floor to ceiling with old newspapers, magazines, and HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF NOTEBOOKS, covering nearly every available surface. Marco picks up a notebook.    Moves to a desk and sits.   Opens the book -- \n86   OMITTED                                                           86 \n87   OMITTED                                                           87 \n88   BEAM OF THE PENLIGHT aimed down at pages filled with CRUDE        88 DRAWINGS OF BRAINS/TOMATOES -- number-gibberish (cross- sections, size and weight parameters, and growth sequences) \n-- AMERICAN FLAGS -- \n-- in the margins, many attempts to capture likenesses of DR. NOYLE AND THE MYSTERIOUS ARABIC WOMAN, repeatedly crossed out, never right. \nFB88   FLASH: DREAMSCAPE                                                 FB88 \nNoyle turning toward us, eyes bright -- \nRESUME - MARCO \n-- under the headline WHAT HAPPENED, extremely small, cramped handwriting that goes on for pages -- \"The recon ends without incident, and we are heading back to forward command...\" \nRAYMOND (V.O.) \n(fades up:) ... we're heading back to forward command. The night is clear. Stars but no moon -- Marco closes the book, opens another journal. Same drawings. Same title page. Same cramped writing, that begins exactly the same way -- \n89     TIGHT - RAYMOND (STREAMING VIDEO)                                  89 \nThe video feed from Noyle's hidden hotel room cameras, digital, herky-jerky: \nTV89                       RAYMOND (VIDEO)                               TV89 \n-- We're engaged unexpectedly by ground forces with helicopter support. In the ensuing firefight, Bobby Baker gets himself separated to the left. Mavole goes after him ... \n90     INT. MELVIN'S ROOM - NIGHT                                         90 \nMarco reading these same words, which Melvin has scrawled in his journals: \nRAYMOND (V.O.) \n... An incoming mortar shell kills both of them instantly, before I am able to -- \nFB90   FLASH CUT: A GIANT MONITOR                                        FB90 \nMarco's whole squad, staring at a digital screen animation of Raymond's one-man military fire-fight -- a CGI Hummer with a flaming tire, Raymond heroically spewing machine gun fire at the enemy, exactly as we've seen it in Marco's retelling: \nRAYMOND \n-- it's okay. I know him, it's okay. \n117   INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY                                            117 \nRaymond and Marco in the back seat facing forward. Anderson and campaign handler MIRELLA FREEMAN sit facing them, talking low, on a cell phone, as: \nRAYMOND \nI saw Mavole's Mom and Dad in St. Louis. I still visit them -- and Baker's mom -- when I can. Do you keep up with anybody from the unit besides Al Melvin? \nMARCO \nI don't keep up with Al Melvin.     He found me. \nRAYMOND \nWhy did you ask me about Kuwait? \nMARCO \n(pleasantly:) I didn't. I asked you about your dreams. At the fundraiser -- why did you say you needed to talk to me? \nMIRELLA \n(covers the phone) Mr. Shaw, excuse me -- they want to know if you'll do an interview with Larry King at six. \nRAYMOND \nNo. (to Marco) What do you want from me, Captain? \nMARCO \nMajor.   Forty minutes of your time. \nMIRELLA \nNo to the interview, or no to six? \nRAYMOND \nHe wants to talk about my mother.     No. He looks at Marco -- \nMARCO \nPrivate time. \nRAYMOND \nWell, we've got about five minutes, right now. And this is as private as it gets for me anymore, so ... Beat.   He waits.   Anderson staring at Marco. \nMARCO \nThere are these dreams that ... some of the men in our unit have been having. \nRAYMOND \nIncluding you? \nMARCO \nIt's a question of what actually happened the night our patrol was attacked -- \nRAYMOND \nThat's easy. (almost automatic) RPG incoming. Mortar fire, we're ambushed. Total chaos. I can't locate Baker or Mavole. You're knocked unconscious -- I find you and pull you to safety and then -- \nMARCO \n(cuts him off) -- Yeah, that's how I remember it, too. (beat) But I dream something else. The limo pulls to a curb -- \n118   EXT. ARTHUR/SHAW N.Y. CAMPAIGN OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON      118 \nThrough the windows SEE a crowded clutter of desks, phone volunteers, stacks of pamphlets. A giant SECURE TOMORROW logo looms above, flanked by beaming likenesses of Robert Arthur and Raymond Shaw. Anderson comes out and opens the limo door for Raymond. Marco struggles out behind him: \nRAYMOND \nAm I in your dreams? \nMARCO \nYeah. \nRAYMOND \nDoing what? \nMARCO \n(evasive) -- You know. Raymond steps just outside the entrance to his office. \nRAYMOND \nSaving everybody? PEDESTRIANS pass between them on the crowded sidewalk. \nMARCO \nIt's more complicated than that. Marco reaches into his folder, pulls out one of Melvin's notebooks -- \nMARCO \nPeople just don't have the same dreams accidentally -- (holds out the notebook) -- Melvin made drawings, he wrote down what he dreamed, this is one of his notebooks -- it's all in here. -- and Raymond's staring at the notebook without taking it, the way Marco once did with Melvin. Anderson and Mirella -- the staffers in the office -- are all staring at Marco the same way the Boy Scouts once stared at Melvin. \nRAYMOND \nI don't have dreams, Captain. (then, gently:) Maybe you should ... see somebody -- talk to somebody who specializes in this kind of thing -- \nMARCO \nI've been to doctors. ... which is exactly what Melvin said to him. \nMARCO \nOkay.   Okay, I'm sorry. Marco nods again, numb, makes a vague resigned gesture. \nMARCO \nMARCO \nYeah.   Kinda like 'special agent.' \nCOLONEL GARRET \nCut it out, Major. \nAGENT GOLDRING \nWhat's your obsession with Raymond Shaw? \nAGENT RAMIREZ \nMan of his dreams. \nMARCO \nListen, you might want to advise your ME to check for an implant in Corporal Melvin's back -- under the skin, just shy of the scapula, left side ... if he's not looking for it, he won't find it. Implant.   The Feds just stare at him.   Like he's nuts. \nMARCO \nI didn't have anything to do with Corporal Melvin's death. \nAGENT JONAS \nYeah, well, that's your opinion, but judging from your file here, apparently you don't know your shit from your oatmeal, my friend -- Marco snaps, spins out of his chair and lunges at Jonas -- Lt. Col. Howard and the other agents step between the two men -- pull them apart -- \nLT. COL. HOWARD \n(re: Jonas) Get this man out of here. \nAGENT JONAS \n(taunting Marco) Go ahead, nutball. Try it. Marco PUNCHES the agent so hard it knocks him down to the floor between the other two. \nAGENT JONAS \n-- He hit me! Fuck! \nMARCO \nHe said I could. Colonel Garret shoves Marco back into a chair, stays in the middle of the fracas, while -- \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nOkay, OKAY --! That's enough. Gentlemen, I need a moment with Major Marco. Now. The Federal Agents retreat with their bloodied-nose, cold- cocked colleague, door slamming behind them. \nELLIE (V.O.) \nEvidently this has been going on for years ... Only Agent Volk remains, unmoved by what just occurred. CLOSE ON - MARCO, catching his breath. \nELLIE (V.O.) \n... Sad little Tin Soldier. \n124   INT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT - PRIVATE ROOM - DAY                  124 \nEllie eats, while Raymond flips through Marco's extensive file: cross-agency surveillance, Army psychological profiling, FBI updates. Repeated buzzwords like: \"mentally unstable,\" \"obsessed with Raymond Shaw,\" \"delusional,\" \"borderline functional,\" \"acute stress disorder ...\" \nELLIE \nIsn't it disgraceful the way troubled individuals are allowed to simply walk around with the rest of us until something horrible happens? Another failure of the HMOs. I'm thinking of sponsoring a bill, with Senator Friedman of Rhode Island -- \nRAYMOND \n-- I don't care. \nELLIE \nWell, imagine how terrified your people were yesterday when Major Marco showed up at the airport and you invited him -- my God, invited him -- to tag along. Knowing what they knew. \nRAYMOND \nI know him. I served under him.   He was a good man. \nELLIE \nThat's what the neighbors always say about serial killers. Raymond stares at an old PHOTOGRAPH OF MARCO: curled up in a fetal position, on a V.A. hospital bed. \nELLIE \n(sighs) Perhaps we could arrange a promotion to a less stressful posting. Somewhere tropical. \n125   INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                  125 \nMarco with Howard, who's visibly upset. He likes Marco, it breaks his heart to watch him unravelling like this. Agent Volk remains in her chair, on the other side of the room: The door opens, and Col. Garret comes in, with Agent Goldring, who gives Marco back his personal effects, and: \nAGENT GOLDRING \nGoodbye. (to Marco) Get out of here. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nHe's free to go? \nAGENT GOLDRING \nShaw won't press charges, and he's got juice with important friends. It's today's daily double. Agent Volk closes her notebook and moves past Goldring as he picks up the tape recorder. She glances at Howard, and leaves the room. \nCOLONEL GARRET \nSomeone from Senator Eleanor Shaw's office called and intervened on your behalf. A beat.   Marco, trying to process all this: \nCOLONEL GARRET \nMajor, you have reached the terminal end of the Army's patience. You're relieved of duty, effective immediately. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nThere's a young neurologist at Walter Reed. Zahn. He's had considerable success with GWS -- I want you to get your affairs in order and report to him \n(MORE) \nLT. COL. HOWARD (CONT'D) \nfor evaluation and treatment first thing Monday morning. \nI'm putting you on a cocktail of methohexitol to take the edge off. \nMARCO \nEdge off what? \nDELP \n'Getting clarity.' Or whatever you want to call it -- ECT not being the precise science that, say, leeching is. Wires snake across the floor to the ECT [Electro-Convulsive Therapy] unit. \nMARCO \nYou don't think this is going to work. \nDELP \nIt's the desperation move, man. But, hey. There is a school of thought, says a victim of induced abreaction -- or ultra-paradoxical brain activity, if you're at all correct about what happened to you -- can have it effectively dispersed by electroshock. Unscrambled. \nMARCO \n-- But? \nDELP \nBut the legions of naysayers will tell you that if the initial work's done correctly -- if the brain's been not just washed, but dry-cleaned -- Takes out a bite-guard and puts it in Marco's mouth: \nDELP \n-- fuhgetaboutit. No sale. (then) Try to relax, okay? He throws the switch, sending electric current through Marco's head -- -- Marco's body ARCHES off the table and he goes into seizure -- \nIMAGES FADE IN AND OUT: \nFB129 -- a man in a gas mask JAMS his rifle butt down.

FBN129-- breaking outside, a glimpse of the azure sea waiting     FBN129 there -- -- but DOWN, TACKLED ... FADE OUT. FBO129-- stumbling from helicopters into a rotor-torn             FBO129 sandstorm -- the dust clearing to reveal ... weary, dazed, exhausted soldiers in the middle of nowhere, under   an angry sun ... ... the SCREEN BLOOMS WHITE, and completely empty -- like an Arabian desert -- \n130   EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY                                          130 \nMarco opens his eyes to the glare of a crisp autumn sun, surreal colors: blue sky, shimmering green, the skyline. His head is in Rosie's lap, he lies curled in the grass. A banana-yellow motorized model plane buzzes in tight circles overhead. \nRosie's talking, but Ben can't hear her.    Just the buzzing. She stops, looks at him. \nROSIE \nBlank again? Marco tries to say something, his mouth is dry. \nROSIE \nHe said this would happen. Marco stares, trying to orient himself. His arm comes up to shade his eyes -- nothing written on it. \nMARCO \nWho? \nROSIE \nYour friend. \nMARCO \nI don't remember a friend.

Jordan picks up a picture of Noyle and smoothes it onto the desk for Raymond to see, as: \nELLIE \nCan we please not go down that road? \nJORDAN \nDo you recognize this man? \nRAYMOND \nNo. \nJORDAN \nHis name is Atticus Noyle.

Possibly, your mother's blind to them, because they pay their way -- \nELLIE \nPossibly the Senator's motives are colored by his desperation to get himself back on the presidential ticket now that the heavy lifting is done -- \nRAYMOND \n(unraveling) I don't -- I don't -- \nJORDAN \nIt's not about me. As far as I'm concerned, this should never come out -- it would shred what little remains of the fabric of our public trust -- think of the nation -- \nRAYMOND \nI don't have the dreams. \nELLIE \nHe can't prove anything. \nJORDAN \nEverything you stand for is upside down!

She tries to shove Raymond away from the boat, but \nRAYMOND \nturns, grabs her by the hood of her sweatshirt -- -- and whipsaws her out into the deeper water, shoving her under it.

Ramirez holds up the notebook -- a page of crazy drawings and text. \nMARCO \nYeah, there are hundreds more of those in his apartment.

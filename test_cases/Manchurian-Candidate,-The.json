Scuffing of feet.   Somebody coughs.       1 \nMARCO'S VOICE \nApproximately sixty four hundred hours before Desert Storm, we were on a routine recon inside Iraqi-controlled terrain, assessing troop strength for what Saddam Hussein promised to be the mother of all wars ... but turned out to be just a little warm up for the whomping he got a few years later. \nFADE IN: \n2   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                           2 \nPROWLING ACROSS undulating land dotted with BURNING OIL WELLS that give the vague impression of, well, hell. The inky sky is awash with stars. \nON THE CREST OF A DUNE \nA U.S. ARMY BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE and matching HUMMER sit, waiting. \nKUWAIT, 1991 \nMuffled THUMP of rap music thrums from the Bradley, and low voices stray from the open doors of the Hummer. \nMARCO (O.S.) \nWhy can't we go directly in ... \n3   INT./EXT. THE HUMMER - NIGHT                                  3 \nA topographical MAP glows on the LCD screen of a laptop portable, faintly lighting the faces of CAPT. BEN MARCO and his big, gentle, French guide, LAURENT TOKAR. \nMARCO \n(pointing) ... this way --? \nLAURENT \nYes, well -- I see the Captain enjoys the road less travelled. Marco is seemingly unflappable, completely engaged by life. \nMARCO \nThe Captain enjoys not dragging his ass down the highway for every Tom, Dick and Qadhafi to take a whack at. Laurent swings his finger on the arc of approach. \nLAURENT \nWell. Of course it is very bad, here. And here. And here, here, here, here -- \nMARCO \nMines? \nLAURENT \nTricky.    Swedish-made. \nMARCO \nDammit. He refers to some satellite surveillance maps -- \nMARCO \nNobody at Command said anything about -- \nLAURENT \nExxon and Global Petroleum hired private contractors to do the work in '86, as part of their asset security program. (beat) Hired an Iraqi firm, in fact, who, now, well -- only they know where the little Nordic fuckers are planted. \nMARCO \n(turns away) Sgt. Shaw! No response. And we RUSH TOWARD: A SOLDIER IN A LAWN CHAIR, face lifted to the heavens, sitting directly between the two armored vehicles. This is SGT. RAYMOND PRENTISS SHAW, late twenties, haunted and aloof. \nMARCO \n(suddenly behind him) Sergeant. \nRAYMOND \nSir. \nMARCO \nRolling in two minutes. \nRAYMOND \nYes sir. Beat. \nMARCO \nEverything okay? \nRAYMOND \nYes, Captain. Everything's fine.   Here. (standing up) I'll \"rally\" the troops. \n4   INT.

You gonna play that hand, or hatch it? -- CPL. AL MELVIN grunts, then they all look up, almost in unison, at Raymond when he swings open the back door. PFC. BOBBY BAKER, a slender man, barely eighteen, a driver, ejects a CD from the onboard stereo. Silence. \nRAYMOND \nWe're moving out. Beat.   He shuts the door again. \n5   EXT. THE BRADLEY - NIGHT                                      5 \nRaymond waits. Another beat.     Then some LAUGHTER from inside the vehicle. He shifts his shoulders, walks back into the darkness. \n24   OMITTED                                                            24 \n25   THE ROCKET hits the Bradley Fighting Vehicle at a slant into       25 its exposed belly, and the truck EXPLODES -- Marco's team scattering, pressing themselves into the sand, covering their heads -- \nA BOY'S VOICE \n(amplified) Were you scared? THICK DARK SMOKE momentarily blankets the road.    Silence. \nFLASH FORWARD: A YOUNG BOY SCOUT - DAY                             26 \nwaiting for an answer, stares earnestly upward at: \nFLASH FORWARD: MAJOR BEN MARCO - DAY \nbehind a podium, in his crisp dress uniform.    His current self: older, tired. Lost for a moment. \nMARCO \nScared? (long beat) You don't really have time to be scared. Uneasy rustling of an o.s. audience. Somebody coughs.         An air-conditioner KICKS IN, rumbling, becoming -- \n27   EXT. THE KUWAITI HIGHWAY - NIGHT - MARCO                        27 \nraises his head.   SEES: -- the Bradley, in flames. -- the Hummer, on its side in the ditch, headlights aglow -- -- shadows of enemy soldiers, retreating across the dunes. -- MILITARY HELICOPTERS materializing out of the smoke and darkness ... circling ... NO SOUND -- \nMARCO (V.O.) \nI couldn't hear anything, as I was temporarily deaf from the explosion of the Bradley ... -- SOLDIERS WITH GAS MASKS lean out of the open doors of the helicopters and drop GAS CANISTERS down on Marco's team. \nIN SLOWING MOTION: \n28   MARCO'S SQUAD -- the effect of the gas is immediate: Mavole     28 collapses in his tracks. Melvin points a gun skyward and FIRES a burst that goes harmlessly wide of a helicopter. Then he falls on his back. HEAVY, LUMINOUS, YELLOW-ORANGE VAPOR swirls across the battle -- WITH MARCO -- his shirt pulled up over his mouth and nose, he wheels to get away from the drifting gas, feet unsteady. Grabs a dazed Bobby Baker by the collar -- \nMARCO \nI got your back, Baker.   I got ... -- and tries to pull him to safety ... knees buckling ... he looks up: 29   MARCO'S P.O.V. - THE HUMMER -- is no   longer stalled on its    29 side in the ditch, but improbably is   righted again, back on four wheels and attacking. A vision    of Raymond behind the machine gun, firing at the advancing   enemy -- WITH MARCO -- trying to process this.    Coughing.   Fading. \n30   OMITTED                                                         30 \nFLASH FORWARD: MAJOR BEN MARCO                                  31 \nBehind the podium.

I signed the recommendation myself. A hand shoots up.    Marco nods toward it. \nANOTHER SCOUT \nWere you wounded? \nMARCO \nI was -- \nFB36   FLASH: MARCO ON THE KUWAITI TWO-LANE                        FB36 \nTurning away from the overturned Humvee, and right into a head-high rifle-butt swung by the hands and arms of a gas mask-wearing figure. \nRESUME - AUDITORIUM - MARCO \nHe blinks. \nMARCO \n-- injured. I fell, had a, uh, concussion -- lost focus -- Sgt. Shaw took command -- A disheveled man comes into the back of the room noisily, as: \nSCOUT DAD \nDid your unit sustain any casualties? \nMARCO \nYou gave them every opportunity to do the right thing, Senator. \nELLIE \n(glances at him) No. I gave them one opportunity. And that was unusually generous of me. She pushes through a door, and into -- \n48   INT. CONVENTION BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                       48 \nRaymond's speech plays, low, on a television, and half a dozen DELEGATES and POWER PLAYERS with \"Arthur For President\" buttons grimly watch Ellie breeze in. Party Chairman VAUGHN UTLY anticipates her: \nUTLY \nThe decision is final, Senator. Tom Jordan is on the ticket. We don't need your blessing, but we'd like it. \nELLIE \n(smiling:) Before we get started, I'm dying to know: which genius here hatched the scheme of pairing a Sound Bite from Nebraska with a relic who thinks keeping suicide bombers off our busses is unconstitutional? \nUTLY \nAll the research indicates that an Arthur- Jordan ticket sits quite well with the American public and -- \nELLIE \n'Sits quite well' translates into how many votes? \nSENATOR WELLS \nYour son is largely unknown outside of New York. His public service, his Congressional record, while commendable, is -- \nELLIE \nMy son is a war hero. \nCONGRESSMAN FLORES \n(cheerful) Governor Arthur has agreed to consider Raymond for a cabinet post. A cold silence.   Ellie stands -- \nELLIE \nWe didn't come here to have a discussion. \nUTLY                            ELLIE \nSenator --                          (to her posse) Did we come here to have a discussion? \nSENATOR WELLS \nEllie, you don't have the votes to block this, or even push the nomination to a second ballot. \nELLIE \n(ignores him) Even running against this cut-and-fold vice president, with his party's record of abysmal failure at home and abroad, Arthur is still unelectable without help. (cold, hard logic:) Consider. The Governor is a corn-belt candidate who -- scratch and sniff -- looks and smells alot like the kind of liberal-labor-intellectual Dukakis was, but without, thank God, the helmet. (beat) Assume our intrepid Arthur can carry the Northeast, plus his home ground, and California. We're still dead in the South, and Southwest, where they win by landslides. The mid-central is a toss- up. Tom Jordan actually becomes a liability in Florida because of his Castro-appeasement profile, and in the Carolinas, where he fumbles the military vote over his \"terrorism isn't a war it's a social disease\" nonsense. The room is surreally silent. Ellie spins and moves like a televangelist, preaching to the frightened faithful. \nELLIE \nYou know this. Your own polls and surveys back me up. (beat) You're counting on Jordan to help you get the black vote, women, college kids -- my gut instinct says he won't -- and Arthur holding the center -- where he's soft at best. And who's to say the President won't throw troops into another third- world skirmish, pushing his sidekick's approval ratings up into the eighties again, and the campaign off the front pages? \nUTLY \nWe're confident this is a winning ticket, Ellie. \nELLIE \nWhat's your margin of error? Five points? Three? (beat) I can swing that, and you know it. I can swing seven away from you -- more than enough to split the party and -- \nSENATOR WELLS \n(over her) -- and deny us the White House for four more years? No. Not even you would do that, Senator. You're bluffing. Ellie stares at them. OUTSIDE, SUDDENLY: the marching band begins playing \"It's a Grand Old Flag,\" and hurries out onto the ROARING convention floor ... \nELLIE \nAmerica is facing the greatest test of its history, gentlemen. Not just from terrorist organizations both outside and within our borders, but from covert alliances of disaffected nations so terrified of winding up on our shit list they believe the only way to protect themselves is to hit us with everything they can find before we get around to them. Am I the only one in this room paying attention to the NSA reports? We are on the brink of nuclear cataclysm, on our own soil, while our policies remain shackled by Jordan-style One Worlders who insist that human beings are essentially Good ... and that Power is something shameful, and Evil. (then) Make no mistake, the people of this great country are frightened. They know what's coming. They can feel it. And we can shovel them the same old shit and call it sugar, or arm them, with a young, vibrant, populist congressman, a war hero with heart -- forged by enemy fire, in the desert, in the dark, when American lives hung in the balance. \n49   INT.

Hell, he's probably the kindest, bravest, warmest, most selfless human being I've ever known. Marco reacts to the image of Melvin from ten years ago: young, engaging, eyes alive -- Marco's lips move in sync with words of Melvin's statement ('bravest, warmest' 'selfless' 'ever known') -- as if he knows it by heart -- his mind shifting -- \nMEDIA ICON \nThe war hero who dedicated himself to public service after Desert Storm ... PUSH IN on Marco.   His eyes distant, glazed -- tranced: \nNOYLE (O.S.) \nAnd at the instant he completes this, or any task, Raymond has already forgotten that he has ever been involved in it.

I'm not sharp -- \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nThe meds help you sleep. \nMARCO \nWhen I sleep, I dream.   I don't want to dream, sir. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nYou're off your meds, sleep-deprived, you have an unexpected encounter with a member of your Gulf War recon team, Al Melvin, who mentions some dreams he's been having -- \nMARCO \nDreams like mine. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \n(ignores) -- and suddenly your own bad dreams come charging back. Made worse by your chronic fear of them. Add in all the recent campaign news about Congressman Shaw, which is obviously rekindling your feelings of guilt and jealousy -- \nMARCO \n-- I'm not jealous of Raymond Shaw, sir. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nOkay. How did you feel when you heard the news from the convention? Marco shrugs. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nA shrug isn't a feeling. \nMARCO \nI felt ... fine.     No big deal. \nLT. COL.

Holding back what he's thinking. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nLook, we've been over this a million times. Until you forgive yourself for what happened that night in Kuwait, the loss of your men -- for what you did, for what you didn't do ... No reaction from Marco.    The Lt. Colonel sighs. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nHow's Public Affairs? \nMARCO \nIt sucks, sir. I want to get back to Intelligence. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nThen for God's sake, Ben, go back on your meds. And stay on them, this time. Get some sleep. I'll see you in two weeks. \nMARCO \nYes sir.    Same time, same station. \nMarco starts to get up -- \nDONOVAN                           ELLIE \nOne and the same.

The men banter on: \nRAYMOND \nGentlemen, how's business? \nWHITING \nGood, Raymond. Business is good. \nJOHNSTON \nCould always be better. \nRAYMOND \nCareful. Any better, you'll be a monopoly. \nDONOVAN \nThere's the challenge. Maximizing the market share and potential of a company. \nWHITING \nOr a country. Off their shared, collegial laughter -- \nACROSS THE ROOM - MARCO - MONETS LATER \nwatches Raymond take his leave from the Manchurian Global guys -- while, at the bar, the generals have established their beachhead of Bloody Marys with a couple of younger men in NAVY WHITES: \nREAR ADMIRAL GLICK \nEvery great civilization has been anchored by a great Navy. \nGENERAL SLOAN \nBullshit. You guys are sea chum, ripe for some raghead with a rocket launcher to put a hole in your bucket. Marco laughs deliberately, trying to diffuse the tension. \nMARCO \n(low) If you can't behave yourselves, Generals, we're gonna spend the rest of the day watching the Orioles game back at the hotel. Whereupon Raymond parades past, with his Secret Service handlers, oblivious to Ben until he calls out. \nMARCO \nCongressman -- Sergeant Shaw -- Raymond turning, but not stopping -- \nMARCO \nBen Marco. \nRAYMOND \nI know.

Garret and Howard trade looks. \nMARCO \nSir, I know I can't ask you to talk to Congressman Shaw, not yet, but Al Melvin, it's a phone call, a quick q&a -- look at his notebooks, hear what he's been dreaming -- and either he will support the credibility of what I'm saying, or he won't. And I'll shut up. \nCOLONEL GARRET \nAnd what is it you are saying, exactly, Major? That you misrepresented -- falsified -- what happened In Kuwait? About the Medal of Honor? In effect, committed perjury. \nMARCO \nIf you just talk to Melvin -- \nCOLONEL GARRET \n(ignores) -- No, no, I'm sorry -- you're saying an entire squad of U.S. Army soldiers was hypnotized into believing that Raymond Shaw deserved the Medal of Honor. And somehow you're the only one who knows the truth. Silence.   Marco looks down at his hands. \nCOLONEL GARRET \nMajor Marco. You will stay clear of Congressman Shaw. \nMARCO \nYes sir. \nLT. COL.

SKID ROW HOTEL CORRIDOR                                   72 \nAt the far end of a long and gloomy hallway, we can see Marco arrive at the door to Melvin's room. He hesitates, then knocks -- \nMARCO \nAl?   Al Melvin, it's Marco ... Nothing. He looks at his watch, turns, walks back down the narrow, high-ceilinged corridor -- haunting sounds of radios and televisions and broken conversations -- he disappears down the stairs -- \n73   INT. FANCY HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                              73 \nRaymond comes down the brightly-lit, elegant hallway, tired, trailing Anderson and his SECRET SERVICE entourage. \n78   INT.

Raymond just watching as he places a small clam-shell video screen open on the counter -- we can SEE a B&W surveillance view of the CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RAYMOND'S ROOM, with Anderson sitting the night watch, reading. The man gestures Raymond through the closet passageway -- \n80   INT. A HUGE ROOM BESIDE RAYMOND'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS          80 \n-- where Raymond is met by TECHNICIANS in sterile gear, surgical gloves. He's entered some kind of portable, surreal operating theater, filled with monitoring device and computers ... a one-way video-conference camera is aimed at a big examination chair in one corner, surrounded by I.V. racks and more techno-medical equipment. The man who is obviously in charge here, starts a digital timer and turns to face Raymond. It's NOYLE. \nNOYLE \nHello Raymond. Do you remember me? \nRAYMOND \nNo sir. \nNOYLE \nBrilliant. (to his group) We have twenty minutes for our little check up from the neck up. \n81   EXT.

When did it ... (listens) Yeah, I know. I know. (deep breath) Listen, Mrs. Wilson -- can you tell me if Nathan was ever -- preoccupied -- with his experience in Kuwait? Did he ever mention dreams or nightmares ... about what happened ... the firefight, afterward ... (beat) -- uh-huh. Sure. No, I understand. (beat) Thank you for -- Dial tone.   He hangs up.

NOYLE'S HIDDEN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                         A84 \nRaymond sits in a chair, rigged up with wires and tubes (much like he was ten years ago) -- a TRANSLUCENT BOX around his face overlaid with a METRIC GRID, his head held motionless by a semi-circular BRACE, curved calibration offering precise positioning for a MICRO-DRILL that Noyle moves into place -- and then a long, tiny drill bit WHIRS DOWN through STERILE LATEX stretched very tight across Raymond's head -- -- and plunges precisely and effortlessly through Raymond's skull, then STOPS -- he has no reaction, feels nothing -- LCD screens -- show a VIRTUAL MAP OF RAYMOND'S BRAIN, in a full range of primary colors -- sections morphing as thoughts and memories race through his mind, as MINISCULE, INTERWOVEN WIRES -- are threaded down through the HOLLOW core of the surgical drill, deep into Raymond's brain. Noyle plays to one of the cameras: \nNOYLE \nNo decay, no slippage. Everything appears to be in flawless working condition. (then) Raymond can you remember the deaths of Mavole and Baker? \nRAYMOND \nYes. The LCD SCREENS show activity in areas of Raymond's brain. \nNOYLE \nDescribe it. \n84   INT. SKID ROW RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT                           84 \nMarco knocking at Melvin's door again. \nMARCO \n... Al?   You in there? Still nothing. He checks the hallway, takes an Army utility knife from his pocket and forces the lock -- \n85   INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   85 \nThe light switch doesn't work. Click, click. Eerie shudder of neon from the sign on the building, shapes crowd the room, claustrophobic ... ... Marco has a PENLIGHT -- he turns it on, sweeps in front of him with its weak beam: THE ROOM -- stacked floor to ceiling with old newspapers, magazines, and HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF NOTEBOOKS, covering nearly every available surface. Marco picks up a notebook.    Moves to a desk and sits.   Opens the book -- \n86   OMITTED                                                           86 \n87   OMITTED                                                           87 \n88   BEAM OF THE PENLIGHT aimed down at pages filled with CRUDE        88 DRAWINGS OF BRAINS/TOMATOES -- number-gibberish (cross- sections, size and weight parameters, and growth sequences) \n-- AMERICAN FLAGS -- \n-- in the margins, many attempts to capture likenesses of DR.

The night is clear. Stars but no moon -- Marco closes the book, opens another journal. Same drawings. Same title page. Same cramped writing, that begins exactly the same way -- \n89     TIGHT - RAYMOND (STREAMING VIDEO)                                  89 \nThe video feed from Noyle's hidden hotel room cameras, digital, herky-jerky: \nTV89                       RAYMOND (VIDEO)                               TV89 \n-- We're engaged unexpectedly by ground forces with helicopter support. In the ensuing firefight, Bobby Baker gets himself separated to the left. Mavole goes after him ... \n90     INT.

He's in politics now. We've kinda lost touch. (awkward beat, then) What's your name? \nROSIE \nEugenie. \nMARCO \n'Scuse me? \nROSIE \nYeah.   Crazy French pronunciation and all. \nMARCO \nIt's pretty. \nROSIE \nThanks. \nMARCO \nI guess your friends call you Jenny. \nROSIE \nNot yet they haven't, thank God.   But you can call me Jenny. \nMARCO \nWhat do your friends call you? \nROSIE \nRosie. My full name is Eugenie Rose. I've always liked the Rosie part better. Eugenie is, well, fragile. \nMARCO \nStill. When I asked you your name, you said it was Eugenie. \nROSIE \nYeah. Well. Maybe 'cause I was feeling fragile. At the time. Beat.   Their eyes lock.   Marco blinks -- FB94   FLASH: PFC. BOBBY BAKER -- stares back at him from where   FB94 Rosie was sitting. Bullet hole in his forehead and a small, lost smile. Reaching out to him -- \nBLINK. \nROSIE -- as before.    Slight look of puzzlement, because -- MARCO -- is on his feet, rattled, moving out to the aisle -- \nMARCO \nExcuse me. -- and LURCHING toward the back of the train, nearly losing his balance as he goes through the sliding doors. \n95     INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - AS BEFORE                                95 \n-- Marco catches himself, hands against the bulkhead wall near the bathroom. Another PASSENGER squeezes past him, headed in the opposite direction. Marco tries the bathroom door. Locked. OCCUPIED. \nMarco reaches into his pocket for a plastic vial of medicine. Tries to shake one of the TINY PILLS OUT, but -- A BURLY PASSENGER in the bathroom emerges and the door SMACKS Marco hard across the back -- -- THE PILLS scatter onto the floor -- \nMARCO \nOW dammit -- \nBIG MAN                               MARCO \nSorry. I didn't know you          It's okay.     It's okay. were -- -- Marco's DOWN ON HIS KNEES, struggling to gather the pills together and put them back in the plastic vial. The big man goes. \nROSIE \nsinks down next to him.   Calm.   Deftly plucking the pills from the floor. \nROSIE \nMy mother would tell you to wash these. Marco looks up at her blankly.    She takes the vial, caps it, gives it back. \nROSIE \nI didn't mean to upset you. \nMARCO \nIt's not you, it's me. I'm not -- my head -- (gestures uselessly) -- nothing's ... (stares at her) I wish I smoked. \nROSIE \nIt's way overrated. They stare at each other.   Then: \nMARCO \nRosie, I'm gonna go in here, wash my face, take my pill, and get myself together. Marco ducks into the bathroom and shuts the door. \n96    INT. TRAIN MEN'S ROOM - DAY                                      96 \nMarco cups water in his hands and smears it on his face, wiping it away with a paper towel. He comes up looking in the mirror, avoiding his own gaze as -- \nIN THE MIRROR: THE DOOR OPENS \nand a man comes partway in -- now it's Dr. Noyle. Marco pivots -- no Noyle. The door is shut, locked.      He's all alone. Losing his mind. \n97    INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - ROSIE                                      97 \nLost in thought. Faint smile.

SLASHES again, oblivious to pain. \nROSIE \nBEN MARCO!? \nPUSH IN as Ben presses the blade sharply down into his skin ... cutting a slit through which the blunt edge of \nAN EXTREMELY TINY OBLONG THING \nappears, like a grain of rice.

Oh no NO ... -- and down the drain -- Marco twists the faucet off, and \nDIVES TO \nFLOOR LEVEL - UNDER THE SINK \nwhere he puts both hands on the fittings of the u-joint trap and struggles to get them loose -- succeeding finally, water spewing everywhere -- -- the trap falls to the floor, disgorging soap chips, slimy hairballs and pipe corrosion and water ... but not the thing he wants. It's -- \nMARCO \n-- Gone.    Shit. MARCO -- rests his head on the cool tile, eyes far away. Defeated. Rosie crouches next to him. A little scared. She blots the blood from his back with the towel, and then presses her ice pack against it. \nMARCO \nTell me you saw that. Rosie just stares at him. \nMARCO \n(hollow) You didn't. You didn't see it. \nROSIE \nSee what? Marco closes his eyes. \nMARCO \nProof. \nROSIE \nOf what? \nMARCO \nMy sanity. \n110   EXT.

Fluorescent lights flicker on, revealing a CAVERNOUS SPACE BELOW, in which an intricate MAZE of CAGES contains unhappy, SCREAMING research MONKEYS with Orwellian stainless-steel hardware and antennae bolted to their bisected skulls. Strange SOUNDS and various LIGHTING EFFECTS emerge from the different sections. \nDELP \n...

LIMOUSINE - DAY                                            117 \nRaymond and Marco in the back seat facing forward. Anderson and campaign handler MIRELLA FREEMAN sit facing them, talking low, on a cell phone, as: \nRAYMOND \nI saw Mavole's Mom and Dad in St. Louis. I still visit them -- and Baker's mom -- when I can. Do you keep up with anybody from the unit besides Al Melvin? \nMARCO \nI don't keep up with Al Melvin.     He found me. \nRAYMOND \nWhy did you ask me about Kuwait? \nMARCO \n(pleasantly:) I didn't. I asked you about your dreams. At the fundraiser -- why did you say you needed to talk to me? \nMIRELLA \n(covers the phone) Mr. Shaw, excuse me -- they want to know if you'll do an interview with Larry King at six. \nRAYMOND \nNo. (to Marco) What do you want from me, Captain? \nMARCO \nMajor.   Forty minutes of your time. \nMIRELLA \nNo to the interview, or no to six? \nRAYMOND \nHe wants to talk about my mother.     No. He looks at Marco -- \nMARCO \nPrivate time. \nRAYMOND \nWell, we've got about five minutes, right now. And this is as private as it gets for me anymore, so ... Beat.   He waits.   Anderson staring at Marco. \nMARCO \nThere are these dreams that ... some of the men in our unit have been having. \nRAYMOND \nIncluding you? \nMARCO \nIt's a question of what actually happened the night our patrol was attacked -- \nRAYMOND \nThat's easy. (almost automatic) RPG incoming. Mortar fire, we're ambushed. Total chaos. I can't locate Baker or Mavole. You're knocked unconscious -- I find you and pull you to safety and then -- \nMARCO \n(cuts him off) -- Yeah, that's how I remember it, too. (beat) But I dream something else. The limo pulls to a curb -- \n118   EXT. ARTHUR/SHAW N.Y. CAMPAIGN OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON      118 \nThrough the windows SEE a crowded clutter of desks, phone volunteers, stacks of pamphlets. A giant SECURE TOMORROW logo looms above, flanked by beaming likenesses of Robert Arthur and Raymond Shaw. Anderson comes out and opens the limo door for Raymond. Marco struggles out behind him: \nRAYMOND \nAm I in your dreams? \nMARCO \nYeah. \nRAYMOND \nDoing what? \nMARCO \n(evasive) -- You know. Raymond steps just outside the entrance to his office. \nRAYMOND \nSaving everybody? PEDESTRIANS pass between them on the crowded sidewalk. \nMARCO \nIt's more complicated than that. Marco reaches into his folder, pulls out one of Melvin's notebooks -- \nMARCO \nPeople just don't have the same dreams accidentally -- (holds out the notebook) -- Melvin made drawings, he wrote down what he dreamed, this is one of his notebooks -- it's all in here. -- and Raymond's staring at the notebook without taking it, the way Marco once did with Melvin. Anderson and Mirella -- the staffers in the office -- are all staring at Marco the same way the Boy Scouts once stared at Melvin. \nRAYMOND \nI don't have dreams, Captain. (then, gently:) Maybe you should ... see somebody -- talk to somebody who specializes in this kind of thing -- \nMARCO \nI've been to doctors. ... which is exactly what Melvin said to him. \nMARCO \nOkay.   Okay, I'm sorry. Marco nods again, numb, makes a vague resigned gesture. \nMARCO \nRAYMOND \nI'm sure the press would have a field day with that. \nMARCO \nRaymond. They put an implant in me. I found it yesterday. Maybe they put one in you. \nRAYMOND \n(horrified) Nobody's put anything in me. \nMARCO \nGreat. Let's prove it. We can go get an x-ray -- we can check it right now -- Marco moves toward him, Raymond backs away -- \nRAYMOND \nI want to be supportive of you, Ben, I do, but -- \nMARCO \nJust check your back, Raymond -- \nRAYMOND \n-- this can wait until after the election. \nMARCO \nWhat are you afraid of?   See if there's a bump. \nRAYMOND \nYou should leave.   This is not, this is not -- \nMARCO \n-- just check -- \nRAYMOND \n(without checking) There's nothing there! Marco LUNGES at Raymond -- they fall, together, over the desk, onto the floor -- Chinese food scattering. \nMARCO \nSomebody was in your head, with big steel- toe boots, a couple of cable cutters and a chainsaw, and they went to town! Neurons got wasted, circuits rewired, brain cells obliterated -- KNOCKING at the door: \nANDERSON (O.S.) \nCongressman Shaw? \nMARCO \n-- you don't even know what they did! You don't -- you can't CONCEIVE what they did to you -- and you're worried about some lame-ass reporters!? -- where Marco (stronger, better-trained) wraps Raymond in a headlock, RIPS Raymond's shirt from the shoulder -- \nMARCO \nIf I'm wrong they can put me the fuck away -- \nANDERSON (O.S.) \n-- are you okay? \nRAYMOND \nBen -- \nMARCO \n-- there -- there's -- something -- INSISTENT KNOCKING at the door. Marco CLAWS AT THE SKIN on RAYMOND'S BACK -- sinks his teeth in -- -- Raymond shakes him off, and MARCO slams into the wall. The office door BANGS open -- Anderson and other agents SWARM Marco -- there's blood smeared on Marco's mouth, his jaws are clenched -- \nANDERSON \n(disbelief) He bit him. (at Raymond) Sir, did he bite you? \nRAYMOND \nNo. MARCO -- shoved to the floor -- twisted -- handcuffed -- blood SMEARING across the carpet -- his eyes wild with adrenaline and fear -- RAYMOND -- his hand goes to his back -- his eyes LOCK with Marco's for an instant -- then Marco is hustled out the door. \nANDERSON \nSir -- \nRAYMOND \nNOTHING HAPPENED! \nHorrified campaign workers crane necks to see inside. Mute with shock, Raymond pulls his hand away from his back. Hides the blood. \n120    OMITTED                                                       120 \nA121   EXT.

ELEGANT MANHATTAN RESTAURANT - PRIVATE ROOM - DAY       121 \nRaymond and Ellie. Through the wavy glass we see a crowded dining room, the ever-present Secret Service. \nRAYMOND \nNo. That'd be political suicide. Of course not. I want you to help him. \nELLIE \nI can't even imagine why. \nRAYMOND \nBecause I feel sorry for him.   Because I said I would. \nELLIE \nMARCO \nYeah.   Kinda like 'special agent.' \nCOLONEL GARRET \nCut it out, Major. \nAGENT GOLDRING \nWhat's your obsession with Raymond Shaw? \nAGENT RAMIREZ \nMan of his dreams. \nMARCO \nListen, you might want to advise your ME to check for an implant in Corporal Melvin's back -- under the skin, just shy of the scapula, left side ... if he's not looking for it, he won't find it. Implant.   The Feds just stare at him.   Like he's nuts. \nMARCO \nI didn't have anything to do with Corporal Melvin's death. \nAGENT JONAS \nYeah, well, that's your opinion, but judging from your file here, apparently you don't know your shit from your oatmeal, my friend -- Marco snaps, spins out of his chair and lunges at Jonas -- Lt. Col. Howard and the other agents step between the two men -- pull them apart -- \nLT. COL. HOWARD \n(re: Jonas) Get this man out of here. \nAGENT JONAS \n(taunting Marco) Go ahead, nutball. Try it. Marco PUNCHES the agent so hard it knocks him down to the floor between the other two. \nAGENT JONAS \n-- He hit me! Fuck! \nMARCO \nHe said I could. Colonel Garret shoves Marco back into a chair, stays in the middle of the fracas, while -- \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nOkay, OKAY --! That's enough. Gentlemen, I need a moment with Major Marco. Now. The Federal Agents retreat with their bloodied-nose, cold- cocked colleague, door slamming behind them. \nELLIE (V.O.) \nEvidently this has been going on for years ...

Repeated buzzwords like: \"mentally unstable,\" \"obsessed with Raymond Shaw,\" \"delusional,\" \"borderline functional,\" \"acute stress disorder ...\" \nELLIE \nIsn't it disgraceful the way troubled individuals are allowed to simply walk around with the rest of us until something horrible happens? Another failure of the HMOs. I'm thinking of sponsoring a bill, with Senator Friedman of Rhode Island -- \nRAYMOND \n-- I don't care. \nELLIE \nWell, imagine how terrified your people were yesterday when Major Marco showed up at the airport and you invited him -- my God, invited him -- to tag along. Knowing what they knew. \nRAYMOND \nI know him. I served under him.   He was a good man. \nELLIE \nThat's what the neighbors always say about serial killers. Raymond stares at an old PHOTOGRAPH OF MARCO: curled up in a fetal position, on a V.A. hospital bed. \nELLIE \n(sighs) Perhaps we could arrange a promotion to a less stressful posting. Somewhere tropical. \n125   INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                  125 \nMarco with Howard, who's visibly upset. He likes Marco, it breaks his heart to watch him unravelling like this. Agent Volk remains in her chair, on the other side of the room: The door opens, and Col. Garret comes in, with Agent Goldring, who gives Marco back his personal effects, and: \nAGENT GOLDRING \nGoodbye. (to Marco) Get out of here. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nHe's free to go? \nAGENT GOLDRING \nShaw won't press charges, and he's got juice with important friends. It's today's daily double. Agent Volk closes her notebook and moves past Goldring as he picks up the tape recorder. She glances at Howard, and leaves the room. \nCOLONEL GARRET \nSomeone from Senator Eleanor Shaw's office called and intervened on your behalf. A beat.   Marco, trying to process all this: \nCOLONEL GARRET \nMajor, you have reached the terminal end of the Army's patience. You're relieved of duty, effective immediately. \nLT. COL. HOWARD \nThere's a young neurologist at Walter Reed. Zahn. He's had considerable success with GWS -- I want you to get your affairs in order and report to him \n(MORE) \nLT. COL. HOWARD (CONT'D) \nfor evaluation and treatment first thing Monday morning. \nI'm putting you on a cocktail of methohexitol to take the edge off. \nMARCO \nEdge off what? \nDELP \n'Getting clarity.' Or whatever you want to call it -- ECT not being the precise science that, say, leeching is. Wires snake across the floor to the ECT [Electro-Convulsive Therapy] unit. \nMARCO \nYou don't think this is going to work. \nDELP \nIt's the desperation move, man. But, hey. There is a school of thought, says a victim of induced abreaction -- or ultra-paradoxical brain activity, if you're at all correct about what happened to you -- can have it effectively dispersed by electroshock. Unscrambled. \nMARCO \n-- But? \nDELP \nBut the legions of naysayers will tell you that if the initial work's done correctly -- if the brain's been not just washed, but dry-cleaned -- Takes out a bite-guard and puts it in Marco's mouth: \nDELP \n-- fuhgetaboutit. No sale. (then) Try to relax, okay? He throws the switch, sending electric current through Marco's head -- -- Marco's body ARCHES off the table and he goes into seizure -- \nIMAGES FADE IN AND OUT: \nFB129 -- a man in a gas mask JAMS his rifle butt down.

CENTRAL PARK - DAY                                          130 \nMarco opens his eyes to the glare of a crisp autumn sun, surreal colors: blue sky, shimmering green, the skyline. His head is in Rosie's lap, he lies curled in the grass. A banana-yellow motorized model plane buzzes in tight circles overhead. \nRosie's talking, but Ben can't hear her.    Just the buzzing. She stops, looks at him. \nROSIE \nBlank again? Marco tries to say something, his mouth is dry. \nROSIE \nHe said this would happen. Marco stares, trying to orient himself. His arm comes up to shade his eyes -- nothing written on it. \nMARCO \nWho? \nROSIE \nYour friend. \nMARCO \nI don't remember a friend. Nothing. \nROSIE \nKind of like a computer system crash -- your brain goes down, then you boot up again, but you lose all your RAM.

The file he stole from Rosie's is disemboweled across the desktop. A library tape machine plays one of the surveillance tapes he's stolen from Rosie's: \nMARCO'S VOICE \n(bleeding through earphones) What else did we talk about? \nINTERCUT - MICROFICHE \nstories flip past ... \nROSIE'S VOICE \nRaymond Shaw.

Finding, finally, an inside page of the SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY section of the Times, with the headline: \nMANCHURIAN HOPES NEW IMPLANTS SAVE LIVES \n... and a p.r. PHOTO of Managing Director David R. Donovan, smiling, flanked by a TEAM OF SCIENTISTS. The caption only mentions Donovan by name -- in the picture his hand is extended, he's got a tiny implant device cupped in his palm. \nROSIE'S VOICE \nDid he have a name? \nMARCO'S VOICE \nWhat? Marco stares at the photograph. \nPANNING TIGHT - ACROSS THE SCIENTISTS \nin the b.g. of the photograph.    HOLDING on one, half-hidden, just slightly out of focus.

Raymond smiles -- it's terrifying -- the fragile, forced, frigid smile of a man in pain. \nRAYMOND \nHello Senator. How's Jocie? Jordan picks up a picture of Noyle and smoothes it onto the desk for Raymond to see, as: \nELLIE \nCan we please not go down that road? \nJORDAN \nDo you recognize this man? \nRAYMOND \nNo. \nJORDAN \nHis name is Atticus Noyle. He is a South African physician, neuropsychiatric scientist and mercenary -- someone our CIA trained for covert mind warfare against the Soviets in Aghanistan -- someone who has sold technology to and done research for terrorist groups, and rogue states. Major Marco claims that this man -- \nELLIE                           JORDAN \n-- brainwashed you -- -- In his dreams. \nRAYMOND \nSir, Ben Marco is sick.   Delusional. \nJORDAN \nNevertheless he's pulled from his mad hat some remarkably lucid connections between his dreams of your exploits in Kuwait, and this Dr. Noyle, and the private equity fund Manchurian Global -- Raymond frowns, looks from Jordan to Ellie. \nJORDAN \n-- your mother's primary political benefactor for the past fifteen years. \nELLIE \nChrist, Tom. They contribute to half the Senate, for God's sake. Silence. \nRAYMOND \nI don't understand. \nJORDAN \nAt the time of Desert Storm, Dr. Atticus Noyle was working under a research grant from Manchurian Global. Your mother's friend. The color suddenly drains out of Ellie's face. \nRAYMOND \nWhat? \nJORDAN \nRogue scientists. Mind control. Manchurian Global. Your mother. You. Connect the dots, Raymond. Possibly, your mother's blind to them, because they pay their way -- \nELLIE \nPossibly the Senator's motives are colored by his desperation to get himself back on the presidential ticket now that the heavy lifting is done -- \nRAYMOND \n(unraveling) I don't -- I don't -- \nJORDAN \nIt's not about me. As far as I'm concerned, this should never come out -- it would shred what little remains of the fabric of our public trust -- think of the nation -- \nRAYMOND \nI don't have the dreams. \nELLIE \nHe can't prove anything. \nJORDAN \nEverything you stand for is upside down! If this were to come out, true or no, it would be catastrophic for the campaign. (beat, a threat?) And it will come out. \nRAYMOND \nWhat are you saying? Silence.

She tries to shove Raymond away from the boat, but \nRAYMOND \nturns, grabs her by the hood of her sweatshirt -- -- and whipsaws her out into the deeper water, shoving her under it.

Darling, what were you going to do, make me stand out there like room service? -- soft curves conceal razor claws and titanium backbone -- she kisses her son on the lips, straightens his collar, his tie, lets her hands smooth his shirt to his chest for a little too long, and never stops talking: \n", "test1_true": "I asked downstairs and Miss Freeman, your 'wrangler' -- helpful Ms. Freeman -- said you were up here practicing your speech. Honestly, I don't understand why you insist upon isolating yourself, people adore you, Raymond, they crave your company and yet here you are, holed up, as if you were some kind of emotionally challenged individual like your father instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw, a handsome, intelligent, people-loving war hero with a great deal to offer to his party and his country. \nRAYMOND \nNo. \nELLIE \nNo what? Baby, I haven't even asked you a question. Your hair is too flat. And that tie. The tie is wrong. \nRAYMOND \nNo to the question you're going to ask.

You're not interested? I thought you were. Did I miss my cue? \nRAYMOND \nOf course I'm interested -- I wouldn't be here if I wasn't -- but not if it means attacking the reputation of a statesman like Thomas Jordan, which I'm sure was your plan. Let democracy run its course, mother. Let the people decide. Now Ellie stares at him, mouth agape. \nRAYMOND \nWhat. \nELLIE \nI'm sorry, for a second there I thought it was your father speaking -- that dreaded Shaw blood rising -- and the stink of defeat made me nauseous. \nRAYMOND \nMother -- \nELLIE \nAnd excuse me, when have I ever attacked the honorable Mr. Jordan, despite the shameful way his daughter misled you that summer at the shore. \nRAYMOND \nMother, you chased her away -- \nELLIE \nIf that's how you want to remember it. \nRAYMOND \n-- you ruined everything. \nELLIE \nHoney, you're oversimplifying things somewhat -- but, yes, okay -- I promise, promise I will stay out of it. You have my word. Raymond stares at her. \nELLIE \nAfter all, you're young and you have plenty of party conventions ahead of you in which to discover, as your father did, that democracy is an elusive and imperfect science, and the meek do not happily inherit the earth, but simply get eaten by the alpha dogs, chewed up, digested and deposited on the carefully mown parkways of American politics. Raymond rolls his eyes.   She ruffles his hair again, heads into the bedroom. \nELLIE (O.S.) \nOne day, you will, I'm sure, tearfully memorialize me in your acceptance speech. Don't you have a different tie in here? Your grandfather always let me pick his ties. Raymond smooths his hair back down. \nRAYMOND \nI'm wearing the one I have on.

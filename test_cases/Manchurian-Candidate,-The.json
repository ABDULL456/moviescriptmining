I feel like somewhere along the line, I've been ... brainwashed. Or something. You know? All scrambled up. \nDELP \nWe've all been brainwashed, Marco. Religion, advertising, television. Politics. We accept what's normal because we're told it's normal and we crave normalcy. Hell, look at the Germans under Hitler. Disco, in the seventies.

(re: Fogel) Good, you've met Jerry. One of the smartest guys in the office. Who's ever sucked a dog's cock out of loneliness. \nFogel's smile turns to a frown.      He hands Jordan a stack of 3x5 index cards. \nJERRY FOGEL Smile and dial. And don't pick your fucking head up till one. \nMARK HANNA Don't mind Jerry, his father raped him as a child. Besides, I'm senior broker here, he's a worthless piker. I heard you pitched stock at your job interview. \nJORDAN Had to do something to stand out. \nMARK HANNA I fuckin' love that!

The CAMERA PUSHES IN on JORDAN, mesmerized as he takes in the ROAR. \nBROKER #1 (to Broker #2) Miniscribe's a fuckin' steal! Thirty eight bucks a share! \nMARK HANNA (into headset) Your broker in West Virginia? What are you buying, a coal mine? It's the 80s, the game is high- tech. \nBROKER #2 (to Broker #3) Fuckface! I got 50,000 July 50s! \nJORDAN (V.O.) You want to know what money sounds like? Visit a trading floor on Wall Street. Fuck this, shit that. Cock, cunt, asshole. I couldn't believe how these guys talked to each other-- \nFogel notices Jordan sitting there frozen.        He covers his mouthpiece, kicks the desk violently. \nJERRY FOGEL Dial the cocksucking phone! \nJordan snaps out of it, starts dialing. \nJORDAN (V.O.) I was hooked within seconds. \nMark Hanna slams down his phone in victory, scrawls out a \"buy\" ticket. He places the ticket into a glass cylinder which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube. \nJORDAN (V.O.)

Tootski? \nJORDAN No.   Thanks though. \nHanna slips the vial into his pocket as HECTOR, the tuxedoed Maitre'D, approaches. \nHECTOR Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon? \nHanna surreptitiously palms Hector a $100; Jordan notices. \nMARK HANNA Here's the game plan, Hector. Bring us two Absolut Martinis straight up. Precisely seven and a half minutes after you deliver those you'll bring two more, then two more every five minutes until one of us passes out. \nHECTOR An excellent strategy, sir. \nJORDAN Actually, I'm good with 7-Up. \nJordan might as well have farted at the table. \nMARK HANNA First day on Wall Street, Hector. Give him time. (Hector offers menus) No thanks, I'm not eating. \nHector heads off. \nJORDAN You can get high during the day and still function? The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 \nMARK HANNA High is the only way to do this fucking job. Guy who coined the term \"three-martini lunch\" was a woman. Cocaine and hookers, my friend, the keys to success. \nJordan smiles, not sure if Hanna is kidding. \nJORDAN I gotta say, I'm really excited about being part of your team. I wanna do all I can for our clients and -- \nMARK HANNA (reciting an ad) \"Here at L.F. Rothschild, our clients aren't just important, they're family.\" Just as long as we get our taste first. Remember something, Jordan, your top priority in this job: make us money. If the clients get rich along the way, bully for them. Got a girlfriend? \nJORDAN Wife.   She cuts hair. \nMark swallows a comment about that.      Gets to business. \nMARK HANNA OK, first rule of Wall Street. Nobody -- and I don't care if you're Warren Buffet or Jimmy Buffet -- nobody knows if a stock's going up, down or fucking sideways, least of all stock brokers. But we have to pretend we know. Make sure you stay relaxed. Nobody wants to buy something from someone who sounds like they haven't gotten laid in a month. Take breaks when you feel stressed, jerk off if you can. You like jerking off, right? \nJORDAN Well... sure. \nMARK HANNA Good, jerking off is key. And I highly recommend cocaine, which will make you dial faster, which is good for me. Churn `em and burn `em, baby. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 \nJORDAN Wait a second. You're telling me if I sell two thousand dollars worth of stock, my commission is a thousand bucks? \nDWAYNE Technically, yeah, but not even the biggest schmuck buys two thousand dollars of this shit. \n28   INT.

You recently responded to one of our ads... \nA few of the other Brokers glance over, eavesdropping. \nJORDAN (CONT'D) The reason I'm calling is that an extremely exciting investment opportunity crossed my desk today. Typically our firm recommends no more than five stocks per year: this is one of them... \nA few more Brokers look over... \nJORDAN (CONT'D) Aerotyne International is a cutting edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on a new generation of radar equipment... \nLATER.   Now all the Brokers listen in rapt attention. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 \nJORDAN (CONT'D) -- so if Aerotyne's shares rise to only a dollar -- and our research indicates they could go much, much higher -- your profit on a mere three thousand dollar investment would be upwards of fifty thousand... That's right, you could pay off your mortgage. \nSeconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing: \nJORDAN (CONT'D) Four thousand dollars, will that be check or money order?... Thank you, sir. \nJordan hangs up, scrawls out a \"buy\" ticket. \nJORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Just like that I made two grand.

Yeah, listen, I quit. \nJordan studies Donnie as he continues his conversation... \nTERESA It's beautiful. \nJordan helps her try it on.       She smiles, but he detects a wave of... something. \nJORDAN They're small, I know, but the stones are really high quality. \nTERESA No, no.

The clients we've gone after in the past -- they're done. We will now target exclusively the wealthiest one percent of Americans. The methods we've used -- over. Loud, obnoxious sales hype is worthless with these people. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 JORDAN (CONT'D) In military terms it's like carpet- bombing -- noisy, menacing and only marginally effective. As Stratton brokers you will be laser- guided smart-bombs aimed at high- priority targets. You will establish an initial relationship with your clients selling only blue chip stocks -- then and only then will you attempt to sell the pink sheets, where the real money is. Now the key to every sale is this: \nJordan writes the word \"URGENCY\" on the board. \nJORDAN (CONT'D) No one buys stock unless he thinks it's going up and going up now. You must convince your client to buy before the takeover happens, before the lawsuit is settled, before the patent is granted. If he says I'll think about it and call you back, it's over, you're dead! No one calls back! So you have to create urgency -- \n48   INT.

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 \nJORDAN (playing along) Does Daddy get to kiss both his girls? \nNAOMI Ohhh, no! Daddy doesn't even get to touch Mommy for a very, very long time. \nNaomi lays back on her elbows, thighs parted - she's wearing no panties. The wind goes out of Jordan. \nJORDAN C'mon, Nay, please. You know how sorry I am. I swear I-- \nNAOMI (cutting him off) Daddy shouldn't waste his time. And from now on it's going to be nothing but short, short skirts around the house! And Mommy's so sick and tired of wearing panties, uhhh. In fact she's decided to throw them all away. (parting her thighs) So take a good look. You'll be seeing an awful lot of it around the house, but no touching. \nShe licks her lips seductively.     Jordan sets Skylar aside, starts grovelling. \nNAOMI (CONT'D) What's wrong, Daddy? \nNaomi slips her index finger in her mouth, starts sucking it. Jordan can barely speak. \nJORDAN C'mon, why are you doing this? I said I'm sorry. \nNAOMI (pouting) Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to say how wrong he is when he's ready to come in his own pants. Isn't that right Dada? Mommy loves Daddy so, so much and there's nothing she wants to do more right now than to make love to Daddy all day long. Well, I guess it's time for Daddy to be taught his first lesson. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages     3/5/13 \nNaomi runs her fingers over her stomach and on to her inner thigh, then up toward her vagina. Jordan watches transfixed, then a change comes over him... \nJORDAN I wouldn't do that if I were you Mommy. I think Mommy should hear a story before she decides to please herself like that. Can Daddy tell Mommy a story? (off her nod) And does mommy promise to keep her legs spread wide, wide open the whole time? (she nods dreamily) Good. Once upon a time there was a great big mansion in Long Island and the people who lived there had lots and lots of money. But of all the possessions they had, there was one thing that was much more valuable than all the rest combined, and that was their little baby daughter. \nNaomi listens, legs still spread, hand on her crotch. \nJORDAN (CONT'D) Now because he was very security- conscious, the Daddy hired two full-time guards, big hairy men both named Rocco, and they installed security cameras all around the house. And one of those cameras is right over Daddy's shoulder. \nNaomi's eyes widen -- she look toward a Teddy Bear on a shelf. WE SEE that one of the eyes is a pinhole camera. \nJORDAN (CONT'D) So smile, Mommy! You're on Candid Camera! \n123   INT.

He grabs a shoe from one of the boxes. \nSTEVE MADDEN (CONT'D) This shoe --    the Mary Lou -- is the one that    really put me on the map. It's a     black patent leather variation of    the Mary Jane, but-- \nSPLAT! A half-eaten grapefruit lands at Steve's feet. In a flash, Jordan rushes over, grabs the mic-- The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13 \nJORDAN All right, let's hear it for Steve Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou! \nHuge applause, with stomping feet; howling, etc. \nJORDAN (CONT'D) Okay, now that you got that out of your system, I want you to know why Steve is so completely off the fucking wall... It's because this man is a creative genius. Steve's power, his gift -- is that he creates trends. Artists like Steve come along once a century! Elvis! Andy Warhol!    Giorgio Armani! Who knows how high this stock could go? The 20s? The 50s? The 80s? \nApplause; war whoops.      Jordan motions for quiet. \nJORDAN (CONT'D) I want everybody to look down. See that little black box in front of you? It's called a telephone. Now I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about this telephone -- it won't dial itself! That's right -- until you take some action, it's nothing more than a worthless hunk of plastic, like a loaded M16 without a trained Marine to pull the trigger. And in the case of the telephone, it's the action of you, a highly trained Strattonite, a killer who will not take no for an answer!   A person who will not hang up the phone until his client either buys or fucking dies! \nThe Brokers go crazy.      Jordan looks around. \nJORDAN (CONT'D) I don't care if you graduated from Harvard or Bumfuck University or never got past fourth fucking grade! That phone is the great equalizer! (pause; looks around) There is no nobility in poverty. I've been rich, and I've been poor and I choose rich every time. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 JORDAN (CONT'D) At least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems, I show up in the back of a limo wearing a $2000 suit and $40,000 gold watch! \nJordan takes off his GOLD WATCH, flings it to the Crowd. Brokers go nuts, fighting over it like a home-run ball. \nJORDAN (CONT'D) And if anyone here thinks I'm crazy, get the fuck out and get a job at McDonald's, because that's where you fucking belong! But before you depart this room full of winners, I want you to take a good look at the person next to you, because one day in the not-so- distant future, you'll be sitting at a red light in your beat-up old Pinto, and that person's gonna pull up in a brand new Porsche, with their gorgeous young wife at their side. And who will you be next to? Some ugly beast with three days of razor-stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in next to you with a carload of groceries from the fucking Price Club! \nHe scans the Brokers; they're on the edge of their seats. \nJORDAN (CONT'D) So you listen to me and listen carefully. Are you behind on your credit card bills? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Is your landlord threatening to evict you? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking loser? Pick up the phone and start fucking dialing! I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich! I want you to go out and spend money! Leverage yourself, back yourself into a corner, let the consequences of failure become so fucking unthinkable that you'll have no choice but to do whatever it takes to win! \nThe Brokers go absolutely APESHIT. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 \nJORDAN (CONT'D) You have an obligation here, people! To your clients! To this firm! An obligation to yourself, godammit! You ram Steve Madden stock down your clients' throats and make them choke on it till they buy 20,000 shares! Be aggressive! Be ferocious! Be telephone fucking terrorists!! \nBefore Jordan is even finished, the Brokers GO BERSERK, some already dialing their phones. \nJORDAN (V.O.)

As always, the point is this-- \nBACK TO SCENE -- Donnie hands Jordan a glass of Dom. \nJORDAN I mean, one like this. Just had her extended to put a chopper on the back. \nJordan points out the Bell-Jet helicopter. \nAGENT DENHAM Never been on a boat with a second mode of transportation on top of it. \nJordan finds the file he's been looking for, offers it. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 \nAGENT DENHAM (CONT'D) (before he'll accept) What is this? \nJORDAN Names and addresses of every guest at my wedding. Friends, clients. I even threw in the seating chart. Heard that's why you wanted the video, figured this'd expedite whatever it is you're doing. (Denham looks: it's indeed a guest list from the wedding) I wanted to show you I've got nothing to hide. I know you're investigating Stratton but for the life of me I can't figure out why. Sure, my company is unorthodox; what brokerage isn't? Maybe we're a little louder than most but we don't do anything illegal. Talk to the SEC, they'll tell you, they checked us out up and down. \nAGENT DENHAM The SEC's actually a civil regulatory agency. We pursue criminal activity. \nJORDAN That's what I'm saying. You guys take on real crime. Which is why I'm so curious: what do you think we did? \nThe reason Jordan asked him here, Denham realizes. \nAGENT DENHAM I can't discuss ongoing investigations. \nJORDAN I understand. \nAGENT DENHAM Though, to be frank, this case kinda got dumped on my desk. Some higher-up felt your shop needed looking into after all that press, fell on me to do the looking. \nJORDAN You know who you should be looking at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 JORDAN (CONT'D) What those guys're up to with collateralized debt obligations? This internet stock bullshit? C'mon. If you want, I'll walk you through exactly -- \nAGENT DENHAM -- that'd be great. And if there's anything you can give me just to close out your file, get it off my desk-- \nJORDAN -- sure, get you back to the real criminals -- \nAGENT DENHAM -- then we could both profit from this little sit-down. \nJordan sizes him up: what did Denham mean by \"profit\"? \nJORDAN You sure you don't want anything to drink? Water for your pal? (Denham demurs) Rumor is your started out in finance. Even got your broker's license before you joined the bureau. \nAGENT DENHAM Who told you that? \nJORDAN (searches his memory) Jeez, who was it...? (comes up short) Ever regret it? Giving up the money-crazed, pin-striped life? Ever think where you'd be if you'd stuck with it? \nAGENT DENHAM When I'm riding the subway home, sweating my balls off, in a suit I've worn three days, sure. \nJORDAN Whattaya pull in working at the bureau, if you don't mind me asking. 50-60K a year? \nAGENT DENHAM Just about. We get a free handgun out of it, though, that doesn't suck. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 \nJORDAN S'crazy, the world we live in, the jobs with real value, the ones we should appreciate -- firefighters, teachers, FBI agents -- those are the ones we pay the least. \nAGENT DENHAM Way of the world. \nJORDAN That's one thing I like about what I do, the opportunity to make that right. Take this kid we had interning last year. Didn't want to be a broker, wanted to be an environmental scientist or something, he had a student loan debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway, his mom gets sick, all they can afford is third-rate care. Some of us got together, made an investment on his behalf and -- boom -- overnight everything changes, she's seeing the best doctors in the country. Sadly, didn't work out, she passed but still: having the power to do that makes all the other bullshit worth while. (as Denham considers that) See, it's all about proper guidance, Pat. Knowing someone with the right relationships, who's discreet. I can change a life almost every day. \nThey measure each other. \nAGENT DENHAM How much that intern make off your deal? \nJORDAN North of half a million. \nDenham summons Agent Hughes over. To Jordan: \nAGENT DENHAM Can you say that again, what you told me? (Jordan declines with a smile; to Agent Hughes) I believe Mr. Belfort just tried to bribe a federal officer. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 \nJORDAN What? I was making conversation. \nAGENT DENHAM Sounds like that to me, Jordan. \nJORDAN ...no, no, no... \nAGENT DENHAM ...sounded like that... \nJORDAN ...no, to constitute a bribe, don't I have to make an explicit offer of money for services? With an exact dollar figure attached? All I said was \"north\" of half a million. According to the U.S. Criminal Code, that dog won't hunt, Pat. (then) Heard you were a straight arrow. That you wouldn't bend the rules other agents might. He was right. \nAGENT DENHAM You did a background check on me? \nJORDAN Figured you were looking into me, was only fair. Plus you sail on a yacht fit for a Bond villain, sometimes you gotta act the part. \nAGENT DENHAM This is why you invited me down to your yacht? With a couple hookers on it -- \nJORDAN -- those are friends -- \nAGENT DENHAM -- to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you? \nJordan puts his hands up: \"you got me.\" \nJORDAN Thanks for coming down. Now get off my boat. \nAGENT DENHAM You know, most of the Wall Street jackasses I bust, they were born to the life. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13 AGENT DENHAM (CONT'D) Their father was a douchebag before them, and his father before that. But you, you got this way all on your own. Good for you, Jordan. (as he starts to go) Thank you for having us. I'm absolutely certain we'll see each other again. (before he does) You know, this is about the nicest boat I've ever been on. Just think what a hero I'll be in the office when the bureau seizes it. \nJordan watches him go, temper flaring: he can't let Denham get the final word. He calls after them: \nJORDAN Hey, Denham! I'm gonna eat a claw of lobster now as I get my cock sucked by Heidi down below. You have a super ride home on the subway thinking about that!                          * \nAs he watches them pull away, seething -- \nJORDAN (V.O.) He was a numbers guy, a follow-the- fucking-money'er. He wasn't gonna come at me through my guys, looking for a weak link and a quick kill. He was gonna come at me like an accountant would, the way Ness got Capone, through my books. Which meant? It was ass- covering time. \nSAUREL Jordan Belfort! At last! Nicholas has told me so much. \nRUGRAT Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel. \nJORDAN Nice to make your acquaintance. This is some lobby you got. \nSAUREL Ah, yes.

It's an impressive office, with          * an enormous fish tank. \nDONNIE We have a joke in America. \"Heaven is a place where the police are Brits, the chefs are Italian, the car mechanics are German, the prostitutes are French and the bankers are Swiss.\" I never got it `til now -- look at those fucking fish! Come here, little guy... \nSAUREL Yes, we have the same joke here. Only sometimes the English are chauffeurs and the chefs are French. The Germans, alas, are always mechanics; no one wants to grant them more authority than that. \nPolite laughter. Jordan, not as impressed by the fish, cuts straight to the point: \nJORDAN I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws. \nSAUREL Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom requires ten minutes of idle chit- chat before business can be discussed. (a smile) Of course, let's get \"down to it.\" What would you like to know? \nJORDAN Under what circumstances would you be obligated to cooperate with an FBI or U.S. Justice Department investigation? \nSAUREL Ca depend. \nJORDAN Ca depend?      Ca depend on what? The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 \nSAUREL Whether America plans to invade Switzerland in the coming months. \nRUGRAT Want me to see if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croix? \nMore chuckles.   Through Jordan's forced smile: \nJORDAN (V.O.) What I'm asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over. \nSAUREL (V.O.) I understand perfectly, you American shitheel. \nSaurel smiles. \nSAUREL The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in Switzerland. But there are very few Swiss laws pertaining to your \"rumored\" improprieties. Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is most appropriate: from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven, and we welcome you. If the U.S. Justice Department or FBI or SEC or IRS sent us a subpoena, it would become papier-toillette. We would wipe our ass with it. \nEveryone's impressed.      Except Jordan. \nJORDAN Unless it was an investigation into stock fraud -- which is a crime in Switzerland. Then you'd have to cooperate. \nSAUREL (now he's impressed) Yes, we would. Assuming the account is under your name. However, if it were in the name of a nominee of yours... \nThey take each other in. The Wolf of Wall Street     Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 \nJORDAN (V.O.) Was that yodeling I just heard or did you just say what I thought you said? \nSAUREL (V.O.) Yes!   Yes! \nAs the meeting wraps up with handshakes, Jordan's V.O. overwhelms Saurel's V.O.. \nJORDAN (V.O.) He was telling me to use a rathole. Problem was: sneaking a U.S. rathole into Switzerland was a chance I couldn't take. What I needed was somebody with a European passport. \n152   SCENES 152 - 153 OMITTED                                         152 \n154   EXT.

(smiles) I feel like a character in an Ian Fleming novel. It's all quite racy, isn't it? \nJORDAN It is, and it's illegal too. Of course if you ever got in trouble, I'd come forward in two seconds, say I duped you, but even still. \nAUNT EMMA Risk is what keeps us young, isn't it darling? \nJORDAN I like that attitude.

Now when most of you met Kimmie, you met her the way she is today -- a beautiful woman who drives a brand new Mercedes, a woman who lives in the finest condo complex on Long Island. A woman who wears $3000 Armani suits, who spends her winters in the Bahamas and her summers in the Hamptons! \nWild applause. \nJORDAN (CONT'D) But that's not the Kimmie I met.

Driver smiles, popping the hood. As Shannon limps out of the vehicle he sees a battered Oldsmobile drive into the forecourt. He takes one look at the owner, then runs his hand through his white hair, breaking into a friendly smile. 
SHANNON Gorgeous day just got even nicer. How can I help you, ma'am? 
WOMAN'S VOICE O/S I've got a problem with my car. 
SHANNON O/S I can imagine. That thing must be older than I am... 
Driver turns around in surprise now, recognizing Irene's voice. 
(CONTINUED) 42 CONTINUED: 42 
IRENE Hi... 
DRIVER Hi... 
A mischievous smile lights up Shannon's face as he watches them. 
SHANNON You boys and girls know each other? 
IRENE We're neighbors. 
SHANNON I see... 
Driver ignores the sly look in the old man's eyes. 
SHANNON So what seems to be the problem, ma'am? 
IRENE Either it doesn't start or it stalls. 
SHANNON Well, why don't we park her over there and take a look... 
Driver is still watching Irene quietly. 
IRENE I can come back later if you're busy... 
SHANNON He's busy, I'm not... 
Shannon gives Driver another sly look as he takes her car keys. 
43 EXT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - DAY. 43 
The Oldsmobile's engine looks like it hasn't been serviced in years. Shannon is bent over the hood. 
SHANNON ...Just my opinion, but I think you should consider buying a new car... 
IRENE (With gentle irony) That would be great... 
She glances round and sees Benicio standing in the forecourt with Driver, watching him work on his own car now. 
(CONTINUED) 43 CONTINUED: 43 
Driver's so busy tuning the engine he hardly notices the boy. His lack of interest finally gets a rise out of Benicio. 
BENICIO That thing doesn't work. 
DRIVER (Without looking round) You think? 
Benicio watches him sullenly, more intrigued than he lets on. 
BENICIO Drive it. 
DRIVER Okay. Get in the car... 
Benicio considers a moment, then turns and calls out to Irene. 
BENICIO Mama, can I go in the car?! 
Irene looks over in surprise, not sure what to say.

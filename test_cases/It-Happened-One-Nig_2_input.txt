PETER'S VOICE 
(from behind blanket) 
I hope Aunt Betty has a boy, don't you? She's always wanted a boy. I think we'll stop over in Wilkes-Barre this trip, darling. Give the family a treat. 
A close view shows Ellie and the detective. They have been staring at each other. 
ELLIE 
(very sweet, calling to Peter) 
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart. 
PETER'S VOICE 
Whome? 
(appearing from behind the blankets; pleasantly) 
Want to see me? 
DETECTIVE 
(who hasn't taken his eyes off Ellie) 
What's your name? 
ELLIE 
(innocently) 
Are you addressing me? 
DETECTIVE 
Yeah. What's your name? 
PETER 
(stepping in front of him) 
Hey, wait a minute! You're talking to my wife! You can't walk in here andwhat do you want, anyway? 
DETECTIVE 
We're looking for somebody. 
PETER 
Well, look your head offbut don't come bustin' in here. This isn't a public park. 
While Peter has been speaking, the second detective and Dyke have entered. They walk over to Peter, the First Detective, and Ellie. 
PETER 
I got a good mind to sock you right in the nose. 
FIRST DETECTIVE 
Take it easy, son. Take it easy. 
SECOND DETECTIVE 
(crowding forward) 
What's up? 
The Second Detective's eyes fall on Ellie and he stops to stare at her suspiciously. He takes a photograph out of his pocket which he inspects. 
DYKE 
(explains) 
These men are detectives, Mr. Warne. 
PETER 
(shouting) 
I wouldn't care if they were the whole police department. They can't come in here and start shooting questions at my wife! 
ELLIE 
(appearing very domestic) 
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question. 
PETER 
(turning on her; very sarcastic) 
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument? 
ELLIE 
(sharply; entering into the spirit of the pretense) 
Well, you don't have to lose your temper! 
PETER 
(mimicking her) 
You don't have to lose your temper! 
(in his own voice) 
That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you 
ELLIE 
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times! 
The two detectives and Dyke are seen watching the other two, who are now out of sight. 
PETER'S VOICE 
(screaming) 
Oh, no! I saw him! He kept pawing you all over the dance floor! 
ELLIE'S VOICE 
He didn't! You were drunk! 
PETER 
(now seen with Ellie) 
Oh, so now I was drunk! 
ELLIE 
Well, you were! 
PETER 
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him. 
ELLIE 
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested! 
PETER 
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man! Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family! 
ELLIE 
(starting to cry) 
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute. 
Ellie goes over to her cot, and starts picking up her hat and things, whereupon Dyke, very much affected, turns to the detectives. 
DYKE 
Now look what you've done! 
FIRST DETECTIVE 
(apologetically) 
Sorry, Mr. Warne. But you see, we're supposed to check up on everybody. 
SECOND DETECTIVE 
We're looking for a girl by the name of Ellen Andrews. You knowthe daughter of the big Wall Street mug. 
A close-up of ELLIE appears as their voices are heard. 
FIRST DETECTIVE'S VOICE 
Your wife sure looks like her. Don't she, Mac? 
SECOND DETECTIVE'S VOICE 
She sure does. 
PETER 
(the entire group coming into view) 
Well, I hope you find her. 
(to Ellie) 
Quit bawling! Quit bawling!

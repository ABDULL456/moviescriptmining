It's Danny. 
ASHE 
(CONFUSED) 
Danny...? 
Ashe rushes to Danny's side, holding him tight, his disbelief overpowered by the unfettered joy of seeing his son once again. 
ASHE 
What are you doing here?! 
DANNY 
It's time to go back, Dad. 
Ashe looks up at the screaming crows above them. 
ASHE 
Is that why they're here? 
DANNY 
(NODDING) 
They're the souls who came before you. They're crying for the people they've lost. 
(BEAT) 
Now they're crying for you. 
ASHE 
But Sarah still needs me. 
DANNY 
You don't understand, Dad. You work for the dead, not the living. Your work here is done. 
Ashe reaches for his son's shoulders, all but pleading with him. 
ASHE 
I can't go, not yet, not now... 
DANNY 
You have to. 
ASHE 
Danny, I can't leave her like this... 
The CRIES of the crows grow louder as the sky above becomes darker. 
A shadow passes over Danny's face. He Seems Saddened. For a moment, it seems as if another entity creeps into Danny's voice. 
DANNY 
If you turn your back on the dead now, you'll be trapped between the worlds. You'll never be allowed to cross over. 
(BEAT) 
You'll be alone, Dad. Forever. 
Ashe hesitates a moment, realizing the enormity of what he is about to do. It's an agonizing choice. 
ASHE 
I have to stay. 
Danny nods. 
DANNY 
I know. 
Danny reaches out to touch Ashe's painted face... 
DANNY 
(FORLORN) 
Good-bye, Dad. 
As Danny says his parting words, the SOUNDS of the world around them come rushing back with startling clarity. Danny starts to turn away...

DOCTOR 2 Yes, your doctor will be with you in a minute.    We have a lot to deal with here, sir. 
ALISON looks round, and shakes her head. BEAN kicks DAVID in the shins. DAVID looks round, puzzled. There is a poster of the human skeleton. BEAN points to the spine. DAVID looks but cannot fathom a relevant meaning from it. 
Another doctor comes along - the same one who they spoke to first.       He's young, confident slightly arrogant. 
ALISON Excuse me, doctor. 
DOCTOR Really Ma'am, we'll get to you in due course. 
ALISON Okay. 
DAVID looks at the poster opposite again. Spine, ribcage, skull. Looks back at Bean gesturing to it. This time the penny drops! Spine spineless! 
DAVID Say that again, son. 
DOCTOR I beg your pardon? 
DAVID I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now. 
DOCTOR I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time. 
DAVID We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. 
A hint of a smile arrives on ALISON's lips. She's heard that somewhere before. 
DAVID So,    why not haul    your    ... (checks) nice little ass into this room and    explain to me    and    my wife why our precious daughter is going to    be absolutely    fine    because of all the fantastic intelligence and    attention you    are    going to give her case. 
DOCTOR Okay, sir.        Certainly.    Good. 
DAVID turns to ALISON - she does a little tilt of her Head `WOW'. And he turns to BEAN, who points to himself,    and nods .... n Come on! 
DAVID Yes, and Bean, for God's sake, keep out of the goddamn way, will you? 
BEAN nods enthusiastically and backs off. 
ALISON Smiling         Well, well. 
CUT TO: 
INT.     HOSPITAL.    JENNIFER'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Close on an E.C.G. monitor, green lines on black screen. DAVID and ALISON sit by JENNIFER's bed. JENNIFER is unconscious. She has her arm in a cast and a small Band-Aid on her head. otherwise she seems undamaged. 
KEVIN    is sitting on the end of the bed playing the SUPER NINTENDO game (the Gothic    Vampire thing, with bats and he-men, we saw on JENNIFER'S TV earlier). It is    plugged into a T.V. which sits on a trolley. It's quite a noisy game. KEVIN    is immersed in it. 
ALISON Let's get a coffee. 
DAVID Yes.     Great.     Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company. 
ALISON exits. David follows. BEAN enters.               He sees JENNIFER for the first time. Sympathy shows in his eyes. 
KEVIN Help me with this. It's a scientific experiment. We're gonna wake up Sleeping Beauty here with the tortured screams of Vampire bats. 
BEAN is determined to help. He sits down with KEVIN. The game continues. The he-man jumps up and down, lashing out at bats with his sword. Lots of noise, but JENNIFER sleeps on. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
By a drinks machine.    ALISON finishes drinking from a plastic cup. 
ALISON Disgusting. 
She looks up at DAVID, who's looking at her.     Slowly she gets close and puts her arms around him. She's a bit tearful. 
DAVID Everything's gonna be fine. 
ALISON (pause) About Charles... 
DAVID shhh... 
ALISON It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh.      When was the last time we laughed? Any of us? 
DAVID I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard. 
KEVIN Dad... 
They look down to see KEVIN has arrived. 
KEVIN These guys just hijacked the T.V. Me and Bean were trying to ...

As the impromptu party dies down... 
SUNGMI Okay and One Hundred? 
REGGIE Keeping it One-Hundred! Being Black as hell just cause. 
Sam rolls her eyes. 
SUNGMI But what about just being you? 
SAM Like I said... 
44   INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT                                       44 
Lionel's got the eyes of the Bullpen on him. Annie's really warmed to him - her hands play with his afro. 
ANNIE You don't mind do you? 
SAM (V.O.) There's only a few ways a person of a color can survive at a place like this... 
LIONEL Of course not. 
GEORGE Alright so then what? 
LIONEL So then Sam says "What, is your daddy scared the Negroes are gonna start a rebellion on the plantation?" 
George goes CRAZY at this. 
GEORGE To Kurt Fletcher!? 
LIONEL Yeah. Yes. Yup. 
GEORGE We've got a news item but there's something bigger here. It's a profile piece on Armstrong / Parker and Sam White's pseudo revolution. 
ANNIE What's the headline? 
LIONEL Outdated nationalist seeks purpose starts race war? 
Lionel's joke hits, but he feels gross for saying it. 
The image of Sam shaking her head in the dinner FLASHES before Lionel briefly. 
GEORGE Beers in the corner. Bang out the news item tonight and we'll work on the profile piece for next week. 
Lionel grabs a beer and takes a seat at one of the open computers. George starts up a beat on his desk as he and Annie stare at Lionel expectantly. 
LIONEL What are you doing? 
ANNIE All Bugle staffer must freestyle. It's law. 
GEORGE You want to be a staffer right? 
LIONEL (awkward) My name is Lionel Kind of like a lion King of the jungle Indigenous to Africa... 
The beat has long since stopped. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) Sorry. 
45   INT. KURT'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                                  45 
Troy heads into the kitchen just as Kurt heads out. 
TROY Yo man, you know I wasn't talking about Sof back there with whole forty bitches thing. I was just -- 
KURT -- trying to get on my staff? 
TROY I never really thought about -- 
KURT -- Bullshit. Game Night is where we make our bids for the new staff. It's why everyone's here. You were practically about to bust out a tap dance. 
TROY I'm a Poly Sci major man. I just came to hang out. 
KURT My staff likes you. A lot. 
TROY But you don't. 
KURT This thing with you and Sof... 
TROY I'm good to her. 
KURT Our dad's have been playing a game of chess off and on since 1972.

PETER You own an apartment because of that job. People don't generally leave good jobs. 
CARL But the bank doesn't feel right... 
Peter's phone rings.   Peter picks it up. 
PETER Hey, honey. I think we should go with the tulips. I know roses are more romantic, but they're also much more clich√©d. Babe, can you wait a second? (covering the phone) I'm going to be on for a while. Ask your guru. He's the one who sent you on this retarded quest in the first place. 
INT. MARRIOTT CONFERENCE CENTER 
Sanji's SIGNING BOOKS.    Carl gets to the front of the line. 
CARL Hi, Sanji.     I'm Carl.   Kendall. 
SANJI (no memory of Carl) Of course! Would you like to purchase my new book, "The Power of Yes: Life is Yessy"? 
CARL Actually, I had a question for you... 
SANJI Well, this line is for book customers only. 
INT. MARRIOTT COFFEE SHOP - LATER 
Sanji's eating by himself.    Carl comes up to him. 
CARL I'm sorry to bother you again -- 
SANJI Can't you see that I'm eating? 
CARL I have a really important question. I have to choose between traveling around the world with a girl I'm really into or choosing a job that will make me pretty well off. I don't know which yes to take. 
SANJI How well off? 
CARL I don't know why that's important. 
SANJI I should know all the data. 
CARL A lot, OK? 
SANJI This is    what I recommend. Every winter,    I throw a two week long seminar    in Aspen. It's only ten grand a    week and it will open your mind up    -- 
CARL I don't want to go to a seminar. I just need help with this question. 
SANJI For you, eight grand a week. I have helped celebrities like Cher and Jack Welch. You will love it -- 
CARL (REALIZING) You're a total con artist. 
SANJI I am not a con artist. Have I not set you on the life path you desire? 
CARL (PANICKING) I've put my life into the hands of a con artist! And because of you I have this retarded yes branded on my hand for life! (yelling to the RESTAURANT) This man is a con artist! Don't listen to this man! He is a con artist! 
Carl runs out of the restaurant. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT 
Carl returns home.    Rooney's on the couch, wearing a headset playing Xbox Live. 
ROONEY (into the headset) You are dead, AnalDestroyer832! 
Carl PULLS the xBox cord out of the law. 
CARL Out! 
ROONEY What?   Why? 
CARL You've slept on my couch for four weeks. You're a grown man. Now sack up and get the hell out of here. 
ROONEY Will you let me stay here please? 
CARL Are you deaf? 
ROONEY You have to say yes if I ask you. 
CARL You knew? 
ROONEY I may not seem like I get it, but I get everything. Lucy and Kath? Made out one time in the bathroom at Rudy's. 
CARL Get the hell out of here. 
INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM 
Carl's in front of his computer. There are a bunch of emails selling Viagra. He angrily deletes them all. He gets a letter from the King of Nigeria. 
NIGERIAN KING (V.O.) Dear Carl, It is vitally important you send me your bank account information. The government will be closing in on my account in the very near future. Your good friend, Omar, Former King of Nigeria. 
Carl starts typing fast. As Carl writes the following email, we cuts of him THROWING AWAY THE BOXES OF STUFF HE BOUGHT OVER THE INTERNET and GIVING AWAY THE SIX KITTENS HE GOT TO THE ASPCA. 
CARL (V.O.) Omar, Let's cut the crap. You are not a king. You're probably just a teenage con artist jerking off somewhere in Russia. Write me again and I will find you and beat your stupid lying face in. Dick. Sincerely, Carl Kendall. 
Carl angrily flips off his computer. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON THE ALARM.   His alarm goes off.   Carl HITS IT off. It's now DAYTIME.

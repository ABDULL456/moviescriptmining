ELIZABETH SWANN Jack, the Letters, give them back. 
JACK SPARROW No. Persuade me. 
ELIZABETH SWANN You do know Will taught me how handle a sword. 
JACK SPARROW As I said... Persuade me. 
[Elizabeth walks away frustrated, leans on the ship's railing] 
[Jack makes an odd grunting noise] 
[Norrington walks up to Elizabeth at the railing] 
NORRINGTON It's a curious thing. There was a time when I would've given anything for you to look like that while thinking about me. 
ELIZABETH SWANN I don't know what you mean. 
NORRINGTON Oh, I think you do. 
ELIZABETH SWANN Oh, don't be absurd. I trust him, that's all. 
NORRINGTON So you never wondered how your *latest* fianc√© ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place? 
Edinburgh Trader 
BELLAMY Strange thing to come upon a longboat so far out in open waters. 
WILL TURNER Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can. 
BELLAMY And what are we running from? 
[Will sees Elizabeth's white wedding dress on a chair in the cabin] 
WILL TURNER That dress. Where did you get it? 
BELLAMY It was found aboard the ship. The crew it thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill fate. 
WILL TURNER That's foolish. 
QUARTERMASTER Oh, yes. ?Proceededly foolish. 
BURSAR It brought good fortune! The spirit told us... Put in at Tortuga. And we made a nice bit of profit there. 
?BELLAMY Off the books, of course. 
WILL TURNER I imagine... some of your crew may have jumped ship there. 
BELLAMY Why do you ask? 
MESSENGER SAILOR Captain, a ship's been spotted. 
BELLAMY Colors? 
MESSENGER SAILOR She isn't flyin' any. 
BELLAMY Pirates! 
WILL TURNER Or worse. 
FLYING DUTCHMAN deck 
[Jones is on deck, having found the cloth that Will swapped for the key] 
[Bootstrap is held at knife point on board the Flying Dutchman] 
[one crewman holds a sawfish sword as a restraining weapon in front of Bootstrap] 
DAVY JONES You will watch this. 
[crewmen are whipped, in order to turn a large screw that raises the Kraken summoning device] 
DAVY JONES Let no joyful voice be heard! Let no man look up at the sky with hope! And let this day be cursed by we who ready to wake... the *Kraken*! 
[the Kraken calling device thumps heavily against the sea]

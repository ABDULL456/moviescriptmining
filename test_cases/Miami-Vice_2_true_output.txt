SEE a third circle of security approach. 
PRIVATE-SECTOR TYPES IN BUSINESS SUITS 
carrying automatic weapons, some more casually dressed, some with night-vision goggles.  The vehicles stop. 
EXT. TOWN SQUARE 
Crockett and Tubbs are directed to get out.  They're pushed around and searched.  A working class Glaswegion Scot, a couple of 5'10" Brits are off to the side with short hair and shoulders that are too deep and faces like Rugby players (ex- SAS).  Russians are ex-KGB.  Languages overheard:  smatterings of Russian, Hebrew and English.  Crockett and Tubbs look at each other:  they get it.  This is the cream of private sector security.  And it says top dollar infrastructure. 
THEY + WE SEE:  EXT. TOWN SQUARE 
Four avenues lead in.  Each avenue is blocked.  The square is closed down to vehicles and pedestrians.  Locals have disappeared.  In the center of the square are FOUR MATCHING BLACK SUBURBANS. 
CROCKETT 
gestures to Tubbs to look up.  They see... 
ROOFTOPS:  TWO-MAN TEAMS - SNIPER + SPOTTER 
with night-vision goggles... 
CROCKETT + TUBBS 
are clean. 
CROCKETT, TUBBS + ISABELLA 
cross through a no-man's land.  It feels like being in the open in Kosovo. 
TUBBS 
checks out the first Suburban's uplink satellite dish on a hydraulic mast.  The rear's converted into computer equipment sitting in ruggedized racks... 
INT. SECOND SUBURBAN - WIDE 
Doors open.  The interior has been converted into a luxurious, limo-like office with swivel seats.  Isabella followed by Crockett and Tubbs enter.  It's occupied by ARCHANGEL DE JESUS MONTOYA-LONDONO.  He's not flashy.  He has smooth skin, slightly opalescent, black eyes.  His right arm is normal length, but shriveled. 
MONTOYA Please take that seat on the side... 
TUBBS Thank you. 
MONTOYA (polite, friendly) Excuse me because I am very busy and have many things to do, so this will be brief.  Yes? (beat; not waiting) We will try you on a "run."  One. To build trust.  We do a thousand kis.  In all matters, when you work for us, you must do exactly what you say you will do. (beat) In this business with me, if you say you will do a thing, you must do exactly that thing. (beat) Then?  You will prosper beyond your dreams and you can live in Miami in millionaire style. (beat) If you are arrested, there will be lawyers made available to you in the United States.  You will use them.  Anything you need, you will be provided by me.  It cost you nothing.  You will contact and work through Jos√© Yero on logistics and communications.  To do with money, you will work through my wife, Isabella... 
Crockett notices that Montoya lightly holds her hand.  It's confident.  And he sees the slight smile on Isabella's face as she watches he and Tubbs... 
MONTOYA (cont'd) More than I, in finance and business, she is very dangerous.  I look forward to our doing work together.  Whether we do or not, it is unlikely we will meet again.  So I extend my best wishes to your families... (to Tubbs) Particularly to your beautiful wife. (beat) Thank you for making this long trip to see me... 
Dismissed, they exit. 
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - EXTREMELY CLOSE:  TUBBS 
Subterranean alarms are going off.  Tubbs finds himself in this small city, occupied by narcotraffickers and their security in the middle of nowhere.  Urgency agitates Tubbs. He controls it... 
CROCKETT 
in the town square, now, too.  But Isabella stayed inside Montoya's Suburban.  Now, she lowers her window. 
ROADBLOCKS 
break up.  Montoya's Suburbans pull out.  The security cordon deforms.  It all disappears around them.  It leaves only the Mercedes, a driver, and Crockett and Tubbs... 
CLOSER:  CROCKETT 
looks after the caravan. 
CROCKETT'S POV:  ISABELLA'S EYES 
in the side-view mirror on the passenger side.  She is looking at him. 
CROCKETT 
holds that look.

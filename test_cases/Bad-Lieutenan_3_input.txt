When the DOORMAN sights LT, he lifts the ROPE, nods respectfully at the habitual patron. 
CUT TO: 
INT: EVENING - LIMELIGHT NIGHTCLUB - THE V.I.P. ROOM 
LT arrives. 
The V.I.P. ROOM is more laid-back, less populous than the throng-filled cave outside. The MUSIC is muted here, and more interesting. 
PARTIERS sit at the BAR, or at COCKTAIL TABLES. CHIC WAITRONS serve the clientele: HOTSHOT BOHEMIAN REGULARS, DRUG DEALERS and HOPEFUL RICH ADDICTS. In the privacy of the V.I.P.ROOM, drug use is hardly concealed. 
LT sashays over to LITE'S table, sits down. LT has taken on an attitude of false bravado. He greets LITE with a crazy grin. LITE is grim, doesn't respond in kind. He's not amused. 
LT orders a VODKA. 
LITE Do you have the money? 
LT (giggles) What money? 
LITE Don't bullshit me. 
LT keeps doing COKE off hs wrist, even as ne speaks to LITE. LT can't seem to wipe the smile off his face. 
LT I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone. 
LITE This psycho can. 
LT Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game. 
LITE (laughs in his face) You're a fucking joke, you know that? (turns grim) He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that! 
LT Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in. 
A COCKTAIL WAITRESS delivers LT's VODKA. LT orders another one, flirts with her -- she's gone in a flash. LT downs the VODKA in one shot. 
LITE You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids -- 
LT Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and -- 
LITE He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it? 
LT I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic. 
This breaks LT up. He laughs until he cries. LITE watches the spectacle. Falls silent. They sit quietly for a moment. 
LT, impatient with the delivery of his second VODKA, takes a bottle cut of his COAT and re-fills his GLASS. DRINKS it down.

ELLEN That's okay -- really it is. 
MAURICE No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone. 
Maurice looks like he may cry. 
MAURICE I'm afraid Ellen... I'm scared of being alone again.  What if one day you realize how boring I am?  What if one day you realize you're not happy? (beat) I could have been alone before, but now you've changed things.  I can't be alone anymore Ellen.  I'm scared what's going to happen to me. 
Ellen takes both his hands and squeezes them between hers. 
ELLEN The day I met you, I gave you my heart.  Today, I give you my soul. Where ever you are, where ever you go, I will be with you.  Maurice Parker, I promise -- (she shakes him with emphasis) I promise, you will never be alone again.

EXT.  OUTDOOR MARRIAGE - DAY (PRESENT) 
The bride and groom run through a shower of rice into their limousine. 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE LIMOUSINE 
They wave through the window as the car pulls away.  They settle in and look to the seat across from them.  On the seat is a fresh flower.  Next to the flower is a note.  The groom picks it up and shows it to the bride.  It reads: 
"CHERISH EVERYDAY TOGETHER" 
It is signed "M.P." 
The bride and groom look at each other curiously.

INT.  GAZETTE BUILDING - DAY 
A fax machine rolls out a tongue of information.  Michelle, the intern, snatches it and jogs through the maze of desks. 
CUT TO: 
KRIS'S OFFICE 
Michelle catches the tail end of a telephone conversation. 
KRIS -- Come on Pete, this is important, this is racism in our backyard... Aw, that's bull... just think about it, okay? 
Kris hangs up. 
KRIS They're pushing my Jewish temple vandalism story to the Metro section... 
Kris notices Michelle's familiar bright red face. 
KRIS What? 
Michelle is completely flustered as usual. 
KRIS Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me. 
MICHELLE (hands the fax over) Umm, Coalville Utah. 
Kris studies the fax before jumping up from his desk and moving to the wall.  An enormous U.S. MAP covers three quarters of the wall.  RED TACKS mark a trail across the United States, beginning with Philadelphia.  Kris puts a red tack at the top right corner of Utah. 
Kris notices through the open officer door that Frank and Seth are listening in.  Kris nods to Michelle.  Who immediately shuts the door on their view.  Kris waves bye before it closes. 
KRIS He's taking highway 80 all the way. 
Kris paces the room -- charged with excitement -- eyes occasionally stopping on the map.  Michelle watches Kris' animated expressions. 
KRIS You know what this is, don't you? It's a miracle.  Not like... 'It was a miracle little Johnny passed his math test.'  No!  This is a real miracle... Turning water to wine kind of miracle.  People should know about this, everyone, every single person... It's time for a blitz.  Let's see what kind of TV interest we can generate. 
Michelle enjoys watching Kris when he's like this. 
MICHELLE Umm, he's going to make it isn't he? 
KRIS Maybe. 
Kris studies the map. 
KRIS But he hasn't hit the toughest miles yet.

Gerald sighs.  He puts the sandwich on the plate and hands it to his left -- obediently.  PAN TO LEFT to find Adelle wide awake now.  She glares at the TV screen silently as she takes the sandwich and dumps it in the waste basket releasing some of her frustration. 
A COMPUTER MAP OF THE U.S. trails Maurice's walk on the screen.

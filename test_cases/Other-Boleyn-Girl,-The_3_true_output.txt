ANNE They have invented a new saddle which allows ladies to ride on their own. 
ANNE skilfully mounts the horse, and sits upright.. 
HENRY ut with no man to hold onto? How will you stay on the horse? 
ANNE Why? The same way you hold onto yours, your Grace. 
A flicker behind HENRY's eyes. It's the first wrong move ANNE has made. 
HENRY We'll see. 
ENRY yanks the reins on his horse.. 
HENRY Let's away! 
ANNE shoots a look at MARY. Then follows. 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY The thunder of hooves.. 
WILLIAM STAFFORD leads the way out with a pack of some forty or fifty hounds. It's a stirring sight. Following the hounds, come thirty or forty RIDERS, led by the KING himself. 
HENRY (kicking his horse) Hah!

Up ahead, the HOUNDS start to bark. Their pace increases. They've got a scent. The BUGLER blows his horn.. 
The DOGS begin to increase their pace. The RIDERS urge their horses to gallop. The LADIES hold tight to their MEN.. 
EXT. FIELDS - DAY Up ahead, a STAG, wide-eyed, innocent, lifts it's head.. 
The sound of the hunting bugle and the roar of approaching footsteps, like thunder. 
The STAG twitches in fear, then bolts off towards the forest. 
EXT. FIELDS - DAY The DOGS and RIDERS roar across fields. The hounds snarl, almost delirious with primal agitation.. 
Among the RIDERS, the more advanced HORSEMEN have already opened up a clear lead on their weaker counterparts.. 
n the advanced group, are HENRY, several COURTIERS, his GUARDS and, of course, ANNE.. 
They jump over a hedge. One of HENRY's COURTIERS catches the hedge and falls. HENRY smiles, then turns to see.. 
ANNE comfortably jumping the hedge herself. HENRY's smile fades. He urges his horse to greater speed.. 
HENRY (kicking his horse) Hah..! 
EXT. FIELDS - DAY The terrified DEER bolts into safety of the forest. The barking HOUNDS, locked into the scent, follow. 
he RIDERS see this, and some pull up. 
IDER We've lost him. He's in the forest. 
Galloping through trees and thick forest is not for the fainthearted. But HENRY charges past, kicking up dirt.. 
HENRY Then we must follow.

INT. FOREST - DAY HENRY weaves skilfully through low-hanging branches. He looks over his shoulder, ANNE follows, close behind.. 
Sharp branches tear at HENRY's face. Some draw blood. Behind him, several other COURTIERS suffer lashes from the branches, and pull up. But not ANNE. She kicks her horse harder. Seemingly impervious to the whipping branches.. 
ANNE Hah! 
Ahead, the DEER darts and weaves. The HOUNDS give chase. 
EXT. FOREST - RAVINE - DAY alf a mile ahead.. 
A steep ravine, with a sheer drop of twenty-five feet deep. At the bottom, a brook with dangerous rocks, then another sheer climb of twenty-five feet the other side. 
The DEER arrives, looks, then scampers down the ravine, pursued by the HOUNDS. 
he remaining RIDERS arrive. They see the DEER scramble up the other side, followed by the DOGS, slipping in the mud, and struggling with the brook. 
everal DOGS fall. Yelping in fright and pain as they lose footing and fall on the rocks. The KING pulls up his horse.. 
HENRY raises his hat, and salutes the DEER. 
ENRY he King of England defeated by a humble fawn. 
The COURTIERS laugh, then they turn their horses around and head off. ANNE stares. It's a clear opportunity to impress. She looks down at the rocks. A long stare, then.. 
ANNE (suddenly kicking horse) Hah! 
The COURTIERS gasp in disbelief as ANNE lurches forward, and leaps into space, heading fearlessly down the sheer ravine. 
orse and rider almost tumble down the vertiginous, lethal drop. But, reaching the bottom, the horse leaps across the brook, then scrambles up the other side.

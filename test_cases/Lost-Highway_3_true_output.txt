REPORTER Warden, nobody's ever escaped from death row before.  How did he get out? 
The Warden and Captain Henderson leave the room without answering. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON - LONG CORRIDOR - DAY 
Pete's parents, BILL and CLAIRE DAYTON, escorted by a PRISON GUARD, are approaching the Warden's office.  It is a long walk along the corridor and the camera examines them in detail as they get closer and closer to the office.  The Daytons are a middle-aged, San Fernando Valley couple.  Bill Dayton is wearing a sport shirt with the short-sleeves rolled up. His skin is leathery, tanned and his thinning hair is slicked back in a duck-tail.  He's working-class, ex-biker. Claire Dayton was obviously a good looking "chick" who's gone to seed from too much sun, cigarettes and booze.  She retains the remnants of a good figure, but it's going fast.  Claire is wearing sunglasses. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRISON - WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY 
The Daytons are ushered in by the guard.  The Warden is standing behind his desk.  Dr. Rogoff is standing to one side, and next to him is Captain Henderson.  The Daytons stand just inside the room for a moment before the Warden extends his right hand. 
WARDEN I'm Warden Clements.  This is Captain Henderson and Dr. Rogoff.  Please, sit down. 
Bill and Claire move to the chairs in front of the desk and sit down.  The Warden, Dr. Rogoff and Captain Henderson all sit down. 
WARDEN (CON'T) Mr. and Mrs. Dayton, as you were told over the phone, your son, Peter, is here. 
Claire Dayton removes her sunglasses.  She and Bill wait - the warden is searching for words. 
WARDEN (CON'T) He... He was discovered this morning... in a cell on death row. 
Bill and Claire look at each other - bewildered. 
WARDEN (CON'T) A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison. 
BILL The wife killer? 
WARDEN Yes. 
CLAIRE How is this possible, Warden? 
The warden shakes his head. 
WARDEN ...Tell me, what was Peter's condition the last time you saw him? 
Bill and Claire look at each other again - briefly. 
BILL His condition?  What do you mean? 
WARDEN His physical condition. 
BILL (hesitates) Same as always.  Pete takes care of himself. 
Bill and Claire look at each other once again. 
CLAIRE I saw him before he went to the garage day before yesterday.  He's a mechanic. Look, is he okay?  Can we see him? 
The Warden looks at Dr. Rogoff. 
DR. ROGOFF He has a hematoma on his forehead and a condition called blepharitis... that's redness and swelling around the eyes. 
BILL Was he in a fight? 
DR. ROGOFF These conditions don't indicate a fight. 
CLAIRE But what is the cause then? ... And how did he get in that cell? 
DR. ROGOFF He can't talk.  Or won't. 
BILL That doesn't sound like Pete. 
DR. ROGOFF Your son has experienced some sort of trauma, I'm afraid.  We were hoping that the two of you could help explain the cause of the trauma and how he came to be here. 
CAPTAIN HENDERSON You don't know Fred Madison? 
BILL No... Only what was in the news. 
CAPTAIN HENDERSON Do you think Pete knows him? 
CLAIRE I wouldn't know how. 
WARDEN (to Claire) You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday? 
CLAIRE When he went to work, right. 
WARDEN What about yesterday? 
CLAIRE He didn't come home. 
BILL Sometimes he stays at a friend's. 
CAPTAIN HENDERSON Any particular friends? 
BILL A girl's, a buddy's.  I don't know.  He's his own man; he comes and goes as he pleases.

SARAH: Everything? The chance to spend my life surrounded by repulsive goblins ... the chance to torment innocent creatures ... 
JARETH (shaking his head): ... the chance to never have a care in the world, to never have to do anything that you don't want to do. 
SARAH looks at him. 
SARAH: Anything else? 
JARETH (smiling): Why, me. Of course. 
SARAH surreptitiously eyes the clock. There is about a minute left. She glides away from the window and tries to position herself closer to FREDDIE. 
SARAH: And what if I'm not interested? 
JARETH reacts with surprise for a moment, then shakes his head. 
JARETH: Impossible. I know you, I know what you want ... 
SARAH: Well, I've got news for you, Jareth. 
She makes a beeline for the cradle. 
SARAH: I don't want _you_! 
She's almost at the cradle but JARETH grabs her arm and stops her. 
SARAH (shocked, enraged): Why, you miserable creep! 
JARETH has hold of her arms but she breaks away and hauls off and punches him in the jaw. JARETH steps back, stunned. SARAH scoops up the screaming FREDDIE. 
SARAH: How could you do this to an innocent baby?!! 
JARETH stands rubbing his jaw, snivelling, stunned. 
JARETH: You hit me! 
SARAH, FREDDIE in her arms, goes right up to him. 
SARAH: And I'd like to do more ... you, you ... ! 
She is furious and wants to hit him again badly. Since she has the BABY in her arms she makes do with kicking him hard in the shin. JARETH howls and grabs his leg. 
SARAH: I wouldn't want you if you were the last ... _goblin_ on earth! 
The WHITE BIRD flies through the window and lands on SARAH's shoulder. JARETH puts his hands on his ears. 
JARETH: Don't say that! 
But it is too late, he starts shrinking. 
JARETH: Look at me! (whining) How could you do this to me! 
Before SARAH's eyes JARETH turns into an undersized, ineffective, snivelling little GOBLIN. The features are those of a goblin, but still recognizably JARETH. 
86	INT: CASTLE - NIGHT 
JARETH's quarters, where DIDYMUS tends HOGGLE and LUDO still blocks the door. 
JARETH (VO) (whiney scream): Why does everything have to happen to me! 
They look at each other and suddenly LUDO realizes that the GOBLINS are no longer trying to break down the door. The THREE start to laugh. 
HOGGLE (proudly): She did it! 
They cheer.

C74 CENTRIFUGE. 
BOWMAN SITS DOWN AT THE COMPUTER. 
PUTS UP CHESS BOARD DISPLAY. 
HAL Hello, Dave. Shall we continue the game? 
BOWMAN Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something. 
HAL Sure, Dave, what's up? 
BOWMAN You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition? 
HAL Yes, I know. 
BOWMAN You probably also know that we found them okay. 
HAL Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.

C74 CONTINUED 
BOWMAN Well, that's just not the case, Hal. They are perfectly all right. We tested them under one hundred per cent overload. 
HAL I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong. 
BOWMAN Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem? 
HAL Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear. 
BOWMAN Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.

C74 CONTINUED 
HAL I'm sorry you feel the way you do, Dave. If you'd like to check my service record, you'll see it's completely without error. 
BOWMAN I know all about your service record, Hal, but unfortunately it doesn't prove that you're right now. 
Hal Dave, I don't know how else to put this, but it just happens to be an unalterable fact that I am incapable of being wrong. 
BOWMAN Yes, well I understand you view on this now, Hal. 
BOWMAN TURNS TO GO.

C74 CONTINUED 
HAL You're not going to like this, Dave, but I'm afraid it's just happened again. My FPC predicts the Ao-unit will go within forty-eight hours.

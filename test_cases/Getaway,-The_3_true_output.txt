DOC (he is very tight) Oh Christ... 
He again moves close... Doc reaches around to unsnap her bra as Carol places both of her arms around him, holding him tightly... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Doc unsnaps the top fastener, the second one catches, remains unyielding... He closes his eyes for a second... The pressure of the moment is again too intense for Doc. Once more he pulls gently away from her. Carol looks at him, her eyes very reassuring. 
DOC (CONT'D) (continuing) I guess I'm kind of... 
CAROL It's all right. 
DOC (explaining the obvious) It's just been a while. 
CAROL We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you. 
She stands, begins to remove her skirt. 
DOC Wait... give me a minute. 
CAROL Sure. 
She sits beside him again, takes his hand in hers... 
DOC I'll be okay. 
CAROL Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are. 
DOC Really? 
CAROL Really. 
They look at one another. A pause. He kisses her; their embrace pulls them back across the bed. 
CAROL (CONT'D) (continuing) Let me make you feel good, Doctor. 
But she has little chance as he begins to make love to her. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
A DIFFERENT ANGLE 
DOC AND CAROL ARE LYING IN BED. 
CAROL How was it? 
DOC Better than I remembered. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
DOC WEARING A ROBE IS COOKING EGGS AND DRINKING WHISKY. Carol enters. 
CAROL I was going to fix you breakfast. 
DOC You were asleep. 
CAROL I bought you a lot of new things. 
She exits and returns with some clothes. He looks at them. 
DOC Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got. 
CAROL Suit yourself. 
They start eating. 
DOC How much does Beynon get? 
A pause. Carol looks directly at Doc. 
CAROL $250,000 right off the top. 
DOC Is he straight? 
CAROL You got the parole, didn't you? 
He picks up a fork and looks through it, as if it is prison bars. She takes his hand and gently takes the fork from him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DOC Thanks again. (then) I 'm glad you waited. 
CAROL (simply) I couldn't have... much longer. 
DOC Yeah... I know. 
CAROL But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.

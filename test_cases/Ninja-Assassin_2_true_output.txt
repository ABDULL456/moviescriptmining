Herbalist places herbs into a hand-grinder as Raizo staggers through the rows of bowls, grabbing what he needs and handing it to her. 
RAIZO ...dong-xia leaves...three of the lo-chan...dragon root... 
HERBALIST You should not mix these.    Very dangerous. 
Raizo ignores him. Gives her some more dried bits and pieces. The herbalist shakes his head. 
HERBALIST (CONT'D) If you are in pain...if you wish to die...there are other ways, this will be agony -- 
RAIZO No...it will save me.... 
HERBALIST It will?  You're sure? (beat) Let me write this down. 
He goes to find a pen and paper as Mika grinds away. 
RAIZO Hot water. 
She goes to a tea kettle, pours water into the bowl.   He reaches for it, and nearly collapses. 
She helps him raise the cup to his lips. Tilts it and watches him drink. Takes the empty cup away from him. 
Raizo shudders as the drugs course through him. 
RAIZO (CONT'D) I have to sleep now...a day at least. 
His eyelids flutter.    She's holding him up now - muscles already loosening. 
MIKA A day?!?     What should I do? 
RAIZO ...keep moving... (CONTINUED) GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08     80. 100   CONTINUED:                                                    100 
He slumps over the counter like a child dropping into deepest sleep as -- 
-- the herbalist comes back, pen and paper in hand. He pauses as he sees Mika standing over Raizo. She looks from him to Raizo and back again, then: 
MIKA I'll have him to go. (beat) Can you...help me to the car? 
CUT TO: 
101   EXT. AUTOBAHN - NIGHT                                         101 
Mika is the proverbial bat outta hell. 
Her phone is at her ear. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
102   INT. SAFE-HOUSE - NIGHT                                       102 
The lights are back on but the place is trashed. 
MASLOW Mika, where are you? 
MIKA Moving.   He told me to keep moving. 
MASLOW He's still alive? 
She glances at his slumped body. 
MIKA After a fashion. 
MASLOW Let us bring you in. 
MIKA Not this time. 
MASLOW Mika, the situation's a little different. Jurisprudence goes out the fucking window when my men get attacked.

MIKA Do you have the manuscript? 
He takes a breath. 
MASLOW ...negative. They got to my office. Everything's gone. 
The news crushes her. 
MASLOW (CONT'D) Mika, it's gonna be all right. We'll find them. 
MIKA ...but I promised... 
MASLOW We'll keep your promise. They're too many people involved now. It's just a matter of time. 
MIKA I don't think we have much time...

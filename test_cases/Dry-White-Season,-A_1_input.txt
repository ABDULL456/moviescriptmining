EMILY What about the Baas? If he asks, they will give him an answer. 
GORDON (bitterly) When the boy was flogged he didn't help. Why should he help him now? 
EXT. BEN'S GARDEN - MORNING Gordon is at work already -- 8 AM -- mowing the lawn. He's intense, unsmiling, burdened as he goes about his task, expertly. Sounds of BEN and JOHAN LAUGHING coming from inside. 
INT. BEN'S DEN - MORNING 
Ben and Johan, in robes, their hair still wet from their showers, having an imaginary boxing match. Johan has Ben on the ropes, backs him out of the house. 
EXT. BEN'S GARDEN Ben adjusts the sash of his robe and takes the offensive towards Johan, as he sees Gordon. 
JOHAN Hi, Gordon. No response.   Ben does a double-take and stops playing. BEN (to Johan) Hold it, champ. He crosses the yard to Gordon, fluffing his hair dry, Johan follows behind. 
BEN Gordon, you okay? No response again. Gordon continues to work.     Ben and Johan exchange puzzled looks. JOHAN Isn't this Jonathan's day to help you? BEN How is he, recovering? 
Gordon stops, switches OFF the MACHINE, stands not looking at Ben. 
GORDON I don't know, Mister Ben, sir -- the police took him. BEN Again? 
JOHAN What for? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: GORDON They arrested many. They even deny they've got him. He's disappeared... BEN Disappeared? He's a child -- why didn't you tell me? Gordon just looks at him, sadly, patiently. 
BEN Okay!   I'll see what I can find out. 
Ben walks off with Johan as Gordon STARTS the MOWER. 
INT. BEN'S STUDY - MORNING Ben is talking on the phone. BEN Our gardener, yes. Probably nothing, but he's worried. INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY Sumptuous lawyer's offices, Johannesburg. They're lush- carpeted. A black woman cleaner is finishing off her early-morning chores, packing up as white staff are be- ginning to arrive. They're fresh, shining, attractive -- whipping the covers off typewriters. A young black girl, smart, well-groomed, is carrying a tray of coffee, desk to desk. FOLLOW her as she approaches her employer's open office door. 
We hear his voice -- see him on the phone in the b.g. LEWINSON ... And when was this? 
He nods, makes notes. He's in shirtsleeves.        At his post early, ready for action. 
LEWINSON Ngubene -- Jonathan Ngubene. INT. LEWINSON'S OFFICE - DAY 
The coffee girl enters, places a cup on Lewinson's desk, and retreats. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: LEWINSON I'll get on to them straight away... Not at all -- I think better this time of morning -- after lunch, man, I'm a zombie. (laughs) Sure -- let you know straight away -- love to, Susan... Cheers! (puts down phone; presses his intercom) Freda! Open an account... Du Toit. Benjamin Du Toit... Subject... Jonathan Ngubene.

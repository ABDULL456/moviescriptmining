Parker again pulls the trigger. Click. Click, click. No bullets. 
SID 6.7 (CONT'D) Like a violin without strings... 
He takes off around the corner. Grabbing another clip from inside his uniform, Parker goes after him. Only to stumble over something. Sid 6.7's bowling bag. Blood flows through its zipper. You now realize the object inside is NOT a bowling ball. 
Beside the bowling bag lies John's body, which is convulsing. His hands have been tied to bare electrical wire. John is being electrocuted. Parker kicks away the wires, but not in time. 
PARKER SHIT! 
He scans the room for Sid 6.7. Parker has no idea Sid 6.7 is standing directly behind him. Sid 6.7 grabs Parker by the throat. 
SID 6.7 I told you I was going to perform a new piece with you. It's called, "First You Suffer, Then You Die." Hope you like it. 
Parker gags, unable to breathe. He then starts to DE MATERIALIZE from within Sid 6.7's grasp. 
SID 6.7 (CONT'D) (as if to God) NOOOH! You can't take him, yet. I'm not finished! 
John's body also dematerializes as Parker disappears entirely. 
The blood seeping from Sid 6.7's wound stops flowing and starts retracting into his body. Along with his bone fragments. His shoulder is healing itself. Right before your very eyes. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is 
ON A MONITOR 
The scene continues seamlessly. Sid 6.7's skin heals over his shoulder wound once his internal parts are back in their proper places. No scar whatsoever. 
His clothing also returns to perfect condition. Literally, as good as new. This is known as AUTOMATIC RESETTING. 
The previously dead Busboy also Auto Resets. His wound healing by itself. We PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal the monitor is one of several 
INSIDE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT CENTER 
a/k/a LETAC. The facility is a converted aerospace research building in Pacoima. Funded by government black book dollars. 
The look is a mixture of industrial grime and high-tech sparkle. Banks upon banks of computer equipment. Wires, cables, conduits, connectors everywhere you look. 
In complete disarray to the uninitiated. But to those in the know, this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the world. 
The building is partitioned into dozens of stations. At each station, a leading engineer in his field is frantically readying a prototype for demonstration. Each new technology designed to help fight the new Cold War... the War on Crime. 
The atmosphere is competitive. Voices are loud. Tension, anticipation in the air. Only a lucky few will have their inventions approved for production. 
LETAC is, quite simply, Los Alamos from 1940 meets Sega from 
At a station in the middle of the room, TWO UNCONSCIOUS BODIES lie on narrow beds wearing form-fitting skull caps made of polyurethane. 
Each skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it at points designated as neural primes. Each needle is directly connected to the participant's nervous system. 
The tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic wire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers surrounding the beds. 
Each of these components isn't much to look at on its own. But together, with the rest of the apparatus, are part of something very new  a revolutionary law enforcement training device whose name you read: 
VIRTUAL REALITY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION SIMULATOR 
To be perfectly clear, the events you just witnessed involving Parker, John, and Sid 6.7 took place within virtual reality, not the real world. 
Dozens of small character modules, similar to today's Nintendo game cartridges, are plugged into .the system's main console. 
Each of the modules bares a name and number, such as MAITRE D' 1.7 and SHEILA 3.2. There is no character version number greater than 4.0. Until you see the module labelled SID 6.7. 
The simulation timer stops at: 17 hours, 52 minutes, 11 seconds. A clock reads: 3:04:32 PM. 
Four observers, two men and two women, watch virtual reality monitors positioned around the station. One of the men wears an L. A. P. D. uniform. His name is WILLIAM COX, 40S. His nameplate reads CHIEF OF POLICE. 
One of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor. Intently following the action on screen. Studying it clinically. Her name is DR. MADISON CARTER, late 30s. 
She is beautiful, and charming, but those qualities take a back seat to her intelligence. She is one of the country's foremost authorities on criminal psychology. Her concerns are empirical. Her quest is knowledge. She has little in common with the other observers. 
The other man is FREDERICK WALLACE, 5Os, Chairman/CEO of LETAC. Expensive suit. Commanding, powerful. But not as commanding, or powerful, as ELIZABETH DEANE, 605, the Presidentiallyappointed Crime Czars 
Elizabeth Deane is solely responsible for the funds allocated to LETAC. As well as which prototypes will move on to production. 
DEANE (quietly to Wallace) What did Cox pull him out early for? 
WALLACE Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember? 
DEANE (a beat) Don't remind me. 
LAB ASSISTANTS remove the polyurethane skull caps from the two unconscious bodies. The acupuncture needles remain in the caps. You can now see the faces of the participants: 
Parker and John. 
Parker lies calmly, his eyes fluttering as he gradually returns to consciousness. He looks very different than his virtual rendering:

Gaston signals to Tom, Dick, and Stanley -- and Maurice turns to see them block the exit. Gaston places his large hand on Maurice's shoulder -- and squeezes. Maurice winces. 
GASTON (CONT'D) Everything's going to be fine. 
89   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - EVENING              89 
The beast sits in a tub -- far too small for him.   There's shadow-play on the curtain. 
BEAST I saw her in the ballroom, and I said, well, you're making this so beautiful, we should have a dance tonight. I never thought she'd actually say yes! What was I thinking?! 
LUMIÈRE No, Master, it's perfect! The rose has only four petals left. Which means tonight... you must tell her how you feel. 
The beast stands, appearing above the curtain, sopping wet. 
THE BEAST I feel like a fool. She will never love me. 
LUMIÈRE Do not be discouraged. 
The beast shakes his coat dry like a dog.   The spray extinguishes Lumière's candles. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) She is the one. 
THE BEAST I wish you'd stop saying that! 
CUT TO: 
The beast plops into his a seat in front of the mirror. 
THE BEAST (CONT'D) There is no one. 
LUMIÈRE You care for her, don't you? Well then, woo her with beautiful music and romantic candlelight... 
PLUMETTE Yes, and when the moment's just right... 
THE BEAST But how will I know? 
COGSWORTH You will feel slightly nauseous. 
LUMIÈRE Don't worry, master, you'll do fine. 
MRS. POTTS Just stop being a coward and tell Belle how you feel. And if you don't, I promise you'll be drinking cold tea for the rest of your life. 
LUMIÈRE In the dark. 
PLUMETTE Covered in dust. 
LUMIÈRE Dark and very very dusty. 
Off the beast, taking this in -- 
CUT TO: 
89A   A brief MONTAGE, as the castle staff give the beast a very 89A bad makeover. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) Start with the hair! Women love nice hair. 
MRS. POTTS I'll take the fingers and toes! 
COGSWORTH Chapeau, brush those teeth! 
Chapeau wields scissors and a brush as Mrs. Potts pours hot water into Chip. The beast is pushed and pulled, primped and snipped. His fingers are dipped into Chip, his nails buffed by Mrs. Potts' steam, as Lumière climbs onto his horns. 
LUMIÈRE Dip dip, snip snip... 
Plumette powders the beast's face -- 
PLUMETTE Eyes closed, poof poof! 
LUMIÈRE And the pièce de résistance... 
Chapeau places one of the Prince's old wigs on the beast. Plumette pecks his cheek with a beauty mark. The beast spins in 
his chair to see himself in the mirror, and -- he's totally ridiculous. The staff, dejected, takes in its handiwork. 
LUMIÈRE (CONT'D) OK, I can fix this! 
90   INT. BELLE'S BEDROOM - CASTLE - EVENING                   90 
Garderobe finishes dressing Belle. 
GARDEROBE Beautiful.     But something is missing. 
Garderobe looks up. There's dust around the gilding that glows in the moonlight. A moment of inspiration.

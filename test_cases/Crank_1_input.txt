EXT ROOF, SECONDS LATER CHEV ducks behind a big ventilation duct. HOOD #2, mid 40's, stocky, is leaning over the edge of the building on the opposite side, looking for something - presumably CHEV - holding a cell phone up to his ear. His folded jacket and gun sit on the ledge beside him. 
We recognize the HOOD from CARLITO'S place; he was one of the men loitering around the pool. 
CHEV sneaks up. 
HOOD #2 How the hell should I know? He went in where they load the boxes. Alright, alright ... H e clicks off - and CHEV is on him, snatching up the HOOD'S gun, spinning him around and poking it into the soft flesh under his chin. 
CHEV (sarcastically) Hey, what a coincidence, you like this spot too? 
HOOD #2 Chevy!   Shit! 
HEV What the fuck is this, you working for the Chinese now? 
HOOD #2 The Chinese... are you crazy? 
CHEV Yeah I am.     Where's Kaylo? 
HOOD #2 Chevy ... I'm sorry, man ... I didn't ... 
CHEV (losing his patience) OK, ding, time's up ... 
In one quick motion he grabs ahold of one of the HOOD'S legs, hoists him up over the ledge and TIPS HIM OFF THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING, then turns and heads for the roof access door ...

CONTINUED: 
HOOD #2 (O.S.) (falling) You son of a ... ! 
... long seconds later, a THUD. 
INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, 5TH FLOOR, MOMENTS LATER The 5TH FLOOR is a little used storage level - stacked boxes, dusty file cabinets, garbage everywhere ... starkly lit with harsh overhead fixtures as old as the building itself. We recognize this as the room KAYLO called from ... more so because his LIMP BODY is still duct taped to the rolling office chair, now lying on its side in the middle of the room. A half dozen more HOODS are gathered in front of the freight elevator when CHEV appears behind them, taking everyone by surprise. 
e's standing over KAYLO'S body, gun drawn, EVE'S beaded purse still slung over his shoulder, PISSING FIRE. 
CHEV Alright, where is that motherfucker? 
The HOODS are completely taken by surprise; they back away from CHEV, spreading out. 
OOD #3 Uh ... hey, Chev. 
The HOODS act almost guilty ... it's obvious everyone knows each other. 
CHEV What the fuck is this? 
OOD #1 Chevy, baby, take it easy. 
CHEV points the gun at HOOD #1's head; the others raise their guns at him. 
HEV ike this? WHERE'S VERONA? 
HOOD #1 Verona got nothing to do with this. 
CHEV What? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HOOD #1 Don Carlos wants you off the street. 
CHEV (stunned) Carlito? 
HOOD #1 You've totally lost your shit, dude ... you're all over the TV ... destroying property, making unauthorized hits ... you're causing the organization a great deal of embarrassment. 
CHEV gestures toward KAYLO in disbelief. 
CHEV Carlito ordered this? 
HOOD #1 (ignoring it) Look, forget about Verona. We'll take care of him. The best thing for you to do is to find a nice, dark, quiet place and just ... die. 
CHEV Just die. 
HOOD #1 Yeah.   Just ... die. 
CHEV'S HEARTBEAT starts to slow. The wooden elevator starts down. He looks around, making eye contact with the other HOODS ...

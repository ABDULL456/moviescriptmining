RUTLEDGE Thank you, sir... I appreciate your faith in me... It's a great day for our country. 
INT. ISOLATION UNIT 
Colter looks out at Goodwin. A beat of difficult silence. 
GOODWIN How are you feeling? Are you comfortable? 
COLTER Just do it. 
GOODWIN Come again? 
COLTER Just do it. I knew they wouldn't let me die. At least you can make me forget all of this. I hope. Goodwin stares at his hands. Unmoving. 
COLTER What are you waiting for? You're just doing your job. I'd do the same thing if I was you. At least you've got a shot at saving those people on the bridges. 
GOODWIN I doubt it. 
COLTER You don't think they'll save them? 
GOODWIN No. I meant, I doubt you'd be doing this, if you were me. An unusually personal statement, coming from Goodwin. 
COLTER Look, someone had to be where you're sitting, and someone had to be in here. Turned out it was you and me. 
(THEN) Just do it. I'm tired. 
GOODWIN Would you like to see Christina again? One last time? Colter's not sure he heard him right. 
COLTER I don't understand. 
GOODWIN Seventeen minutes. That's all I could give you. No mission to fulfill. Just... the two of you. 
COLTER 
(STUNNED) Why would you do that? 
GOODWIN As a favor. One prisoner to another. 
COLTER Prisoner? 
GOODWIN You were right. About me. And about Source Code. We've kept too much from each other. An odd sensation comes over Colter. 
GOODWIN I usually report in at 0600. Today I was there early. I was there when the call came in. Your call. His call? They share a long look. 
COLTER No... There's no way... There's no way you could have... Goodwin just smiles. 
COLTER 
(PROTESTING) How? The Source Code was a parallel world! You told me so! It's hermetically sealed. Nothing I did on that train would have any effect on this reality! 
GOODWIN You were on the train. I was not. 
COLTER But... 
GOODWIN We didn't know if any bleed- throughs could occur. The implications would be staggering. That's why you were told to avoid unduly influencing events. 
COLTER You're saying I could have saved those people?! 
GOODWIN No. Not in our world. The time currents are too strong. But minor alterations, here and there, a phone call, say, those might slip through. We didn't know for sure. But you proved it. Colter is thunderstruck. Unable to grasp it. 
GOODWIN I've been thinking about the things you said on that call. As the day passed, the more I understood them. And now, I guess we've caught up to each other.

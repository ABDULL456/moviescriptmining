INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT 
As Haven and Charlie descend. Her face is hard. 
CHARLIE I seem to always end up like this with you. I take you for granted. You like it that way. It goes with loaded dice and crimped cards and fixed wheels. 
HAVEN Isn't that your business. 
CHARLIE It isn't my life. 
As they descend, Stellman can be seen in the bar crowd, watching them. 
MED. SHOT of Charlie and Haven at foot of stairs. Haven is smiling at her, but her face is serious and her eyes hard. 
CHARLIE You told me once you might be a missionary on your way to China. And that's as much as I've ever found out about you. You're working for me, but for all I know you could be working for somebody else. 
HAVEN Like Goddard? 
CHARLIE Why not? 
Haven smiles. He can see Stellman approaching. 
HAVEN I think I better bring you that gold. 
He starts away, but Stellman halts him. 
STELLMAN Haven. 
Haven looks at him. Charlie watches. 
HAVEN Don't tell me you're still recruiting? 
STELLMAN Yes, we still want you. But this is a little different. 
HAVEN And how's that? 
STELLMAN Captain Iles has asked me to take you into custody, Haven. 
Haven stares at him, then looks at Charlie. A slow smile dawns on her face. 
CHARLIE (quietly) You heard the man. 
STELLMAN Best thing for you is to come along, Haven. 
HAVEN That's what I like -- the best thing for me. 
He pats Charlie's shoulder and then walks out with Stellman. Charlie watches them go. Prince appears beside her. 
PRINCE Very friendly with everybody -- isn't he? Wells Fargo detectives, and now the Army. How far can he go? 
CHARLIE Exactly where he's headed now -- to jail. 
She walks away towards the piano. Prince stands there, watching Haven go. 
DISSOLVE 
Note: Pick up two night exteriors of the post. 
INT. ILES' OFFICE - NIGHT 
There is a sergeant inside facing Iles who sits behind his desk. Stellman and Haven pause at the door. 
SERGEANT (to Iles) The Quartermaster at Platte wants three sworn statements before he'll replace those seventy uniforms, sir. 
ILES Three sworn statements! I told him all I know. They were in the freight office at West Rim City. The building burned down.. .you sure he doesn't want me to send him the ashes too? (seeing Stellman) All right, have Stamm fix the papers. 
The Sergeant exits. Iles looks calmly and with relish at Haven. 
ILES (pleasantly) Come in. 
Haven and Stellman enter. Stellman closes the door and stands near it. Haven smiles and nods at Iles, then sits down unbidden. 
ILES Nice to see you alive. 
HAVEN Dumb luck. 
ILES You seem to have been living quite an adventurous life. 
HAVEN Is that why I'm under arrest? 
ILES That's indefinite. I wanted to talk to you. 
HAVEN If you consult the Army Blue Book it might enable you to be more definite. 
ILES (grimly) Curiously enough, you got me into the habit of reading myself. You're quite right about The Blue Book -- (fiercely) UNLESS that officer should get himself about one-half as far out of line as you have! 
HAVEN How far is that?

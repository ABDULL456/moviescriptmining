{"train": "AMERICAN MILKSHAKE \nWritten by \nDavid Andalman \nCo-writer, Mariko Munro \nINT. OLD FASHIONED STAGE \nCirca 1900. \nA white man in a top hat introduces the final act of a black face performance. \nTOP HAT MAN In the spirit of true minstrelsy, you have again shown that laughter is the wine of life. \nSome 50 performers stand and break out into song. \nRoll credits to the music. \nAn average American teenage boy begins to speak. His name is JOLIE. \nJOLIE (V.O.) All my life, my parents have told me I'm smart and talented. That I can be anything I wanna be when I grow up. Getting into the West Branch Magnet Program was supposed to be some kinda honor. They probly thought I'd grow up to be a doctor, or a lawyer, or scientist that cures cancer and junk. I mean for me school has always been a breeze. \nEXT. SUBURBAN HIGH SCHOOL - CIRCA 1990 \nNow in the mid-90s, for our story present day. \nJOLIE (V.O.) But when I look around, I just feel surrounded by dorks. \nAngle on an old school hoop on the horizon. A kid silouettes against the sky lays the ball in. \nJOLIE (V.O.) All I want, is to be like the kids on varisty, who live in the Maple Ave towers. \nEXT. MAPLE AVE TOWERS - DAY \nA part of a suburban neighborhood lines with huge apartment buildings. \nJOLIE (V.O.) The maple ave kids are coming up from nothing. I mean, their only shot at college is balling. And they've got girls blowing up their pagers twenty-four seven. \nBlack kids play ball apartment buildings towering over them. \nINT. BASKETBALL GYM \nThe young naive face of Jolie in the midst of tryout. \nJOLIE (V.O.) I pray to God I make varsity. I'd do anything to be like the Maple Ave. kids. \nMontage of tryout - Jolie the olny white kid among them. Suicide drills. Push ups. Machine gun defensive stand exercises. Scrimmaging. Jolie is just a breath behind everyone at pretty much all of them. \nAnd now Jolie is at the line. A classic american basketball tryout drill. Miss and you run. \nAll the players but Jolie watch from the baseline. \nJolie lines up his shot carefully. \nHe glaces at the coach who holds a clipboard. \nJolie fires. For a split second it's dead on but then it bricks wildly. \nThe kids take off running. \nCOACH That was terrible. \nINT. HENRIETTA'S GOLDEN BEDROOM - MORNING \nSounds of a high pace video game begin. \nJOLIE, in his tighty-whities, plays Sonic on a Sega Genesis. Also on the bed, black girl HENRIETTA AARONSON tries to do her homework. \nHENRIETTA Do you think you're gonna make varsity? \nJolie drops his controller and tears up. \nHENRIETTA School is so wack. \nJolie composes himself. \nHAROON Hey, can I be excused for the Million Man March? \nJOLIE Hey, can I use the bathroom? \nThe teacher MR. MCCARTY already has the passes raised. \nINT. YELLOW HALLWAY \nEmpty except Jolie and Haroon. \nHAROON Dude, don't they post who made the team today? \nJOLIE Naw, not till Monday they said. \nHAROON Alright man, have a good day at school. \nJOLIE Yeah right. \nHAROON See ya. \nThey smack a secret handshake and Haroon exits. \nAlone, Jolie looks longingly out the window. \nJOLIE Lucky bastards. \nEXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT \nHaroon waves good-bye to Jolie. \nMinority kids are hopping into cars with their march signs, psyched to be getting out of school. \nJOLIE (voice over, whisper) This sucks. All the minorities get an excused absence for the Million Man March. \nAn almost white looking kid enters the frame. \nJOLIE (V.O.) But me, I'm stuck in school like a bama. \nHaroon waves a last goodbye from his Nissan Saturn. \nINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY \nJolie - still looking enviously out the window. \nJOLIE (V.O.) I wish I was one of them. I wish I was one of them. I wish I was one of them. Fuck. \nINT. HENRIETTA'S GOLDEN BEDROOM - DAY \nHenrietta rocks out to her walk-man while jamming on some homework. \nJolie's in his underwear again playing Sonic. \nJOLIE (V.O.) I'm supposed to tutor Henrietta every Sunday. She's getting an F in math. She knows how to do it though. She's flunking on purpose. \nJolie looks back at Henrietta and smiles to himself. \nJOLIE (V.O.) She's so gangster. \nINT. HENRIETTA'S LIVINGROOM - LATER \nJolie, clothed, bounds down the steps again, this time two at a time. \nEXT. TOWN ESTABLISHING SHOTS \nSuburban homes with large apartments towers in the background. The school is in the more urban part of town. \nEXT. WESTBRANCH SCHOOL GYM \nThe doors spray-painted \"thug life.\" \nEXT. WEST BRANCH HS TRACK AND FIELD \nJolie and Haroon sit on the hill doing homework. \nHAROON Hey you heard Fransisco got arrested? \nSMASH CUT TO: \nJolie takes off running down the hall past a mop leaning against the wall. \nJOLIE (voice over, whisper) As a white boy I just didn't fit in, not in Takoma Park. But now... \nJolie becomes a black silhouette against a row of windows. \nJOLIE (voice over, whisper) I was practically black. \nEXT. SPARSE WOODS - DAY \nJolie, in his gold Webber jersey, hops in the woods. He wears large purple ankle weights, and \"Jump Soles\" (clunky and clumsy looking work out shoes). \nJOLIE (voice over, whisper) I even ditched class to work on my hops. \nExhausted, Jolie gathers his basketball and backpack and leaves. \nA metro train roars past in the background. \nINT. JOLIE'S JUNKY BASEMENT - NO WINDOWS \nJolie is bench pressing and Haroon is spotting. \nA single florescent fixture hangs overhead. \nHAROON Man, I can't believe you made the team. \nJolie finishes his set. Pops up. \nJOLIE I was the last bama on the list! If Francisco hadn't been arrested I'd still be a loser! I'd be just another Joe Shmoe Lame-oh geek in the Blair High School Magnet. \nCLOSE ON HAROON: his face slowly falls. \nJOLIE Oh hey, can your mom give you a ride home later. There's something I gotta do. \nHAROON Oh... Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. \nThey rotate positions - we see that Jolie has only been lifting 5 lb. weights. \nJOLIE 2.5's right? \nHAROON Yeah. \nJolie leans down on the bar and grins to himself - still on cloud nine. \nEXT. STREETS OF TAKOMA PARK - DAY \nA shiny cherry-red '93 Nissan Quest approaches. \nJOLIE (voice over, whispering) Tupac. Biggie. Snoop Dog. Easy-E. Dr. Dre. Suge Knight. Mr. T. \nThe Quest pulls to the curb - Jolie and his Dad inside. \nJOLIE'S DAD Alright bye. No injuries. \nJolie hops out in black and red basketball gear - black headband, black Jordans, even black socks. \nJOLIE Alright, bye Dad. \nA clunker 90s cell phone rings. Jolie's Dad answers. \nJOLIE'S DAD Hey, you back from the hill? What happened? \nEXT. SMALL CLEARING IN THE WOODS \nHenrietta sits alone on a stump listening to her Walkman. \nJolie bounds down a path startling her. \nHENRIETTA It smells like dog shit in these woods, Jolie. Why'd you want to meet out here anyway? \nJolie chokes up. \nJOLIE Wow. That is pretty bad. It smells like a dead mouse or something. \nHENRIETTA You dont want to be seen with me do you? Cus I'm pregnant. \nJOLIE ...what? No. \nThe team of Blair Blazers sit together, their heads moving in unison, following the action. \nAt the end of the bench are ARIUS and Jolie. ARIUS, covered in sweat, is a tall thin, care-free, light-skinned black kid. He has a huge scar on his head, a thick red headband and band- aids over his earrings. \nJolie is bone dry and still in his warm up suit. \nARIUS Now it comes with two free controllers and the game. \nJOLIE (not paying attention) Oh yeah. \nARIUS Yeah. We were playing that joint at my place and one of the cheerleaders was all confessing how cute she thinks you are. \nJOLIE (EXCITED) Which one? \nARIUS (points to the cheerleader BENCH) Christine Ortanyez. \nJolie focuses in on a particularly cute Panamanian cheerleader - CHRISTINE ORTANYEZ. \nJOLIE POV: slow motion of Christine - taps her palms and does a leg kick then looks directly at us. \nCOACH DALE Jolie! \nJolie flinches. \nCoach Dale - in afine suit and gold rimmed glasses - glares. \nCOACH DALE(CONT'D) Get Pistol. \nJolie rips off his warm-ups in a panic. The shirt gets stuck over his head, then he trips over his pants. \nHis teammates look on with various expressions of concern and laughter. \nA cheerleader from the opposing team points and giggles. \nREDHEAD GRUNGE KID (O.S.) Unsnap it! \nStruggling, Jolie frees himself. \nCoach Dale shakes his head and so does the fat black man directly behind him. Their expressions match exactly. \nThe old white referee blows his whistle hard - game over. \nAll the Blazers start high-fiving each other but Jolie. \nINT. JOLIE'S MESSY ROOM - NIGHT \nA six foot long poster of a '91 Lamborghini Countach covers the wall. A Nerf basketball hoop hangs on the closed door. \nHaroon is dressed up as a woman, using a wig, socks as breasts, and a sheet as a skirt. \nHAROON Come on man, we've gotta nail the Marion Barry skit tomorrow or I'm gonna get a B in English. \nJOLIE I don't feel like it. I told you. \nJolie throws an African hat and tap shoes off his bed and they smash against the wall. \nHAROON Dude, it's was just a preseason game, come on. \nJOLIE Man, if I can't get in when we're up thirty in the preseason then I'm never gonna play. \nJolie pulls off his jersey and throws it down. He picks up a switch blade and looks at his warped reflection. \nHAROON He tried to put you in the game. \nJOLIE Yeah, for thirty seconds. \nThere's a knock on the door. \nJolie wipes a teary eye and straights up. \nELLIOTT, Jolie's oddly old dad - enters with a bright orange Nerf ball off the bedside table. \nELLIOTT Three. Two. (PUMP FAKE) One. \nElliott dunks and freezes in mid air. \nHe makes the sounds of a sold out crowd, animatedly, in a comforting way. \nREDHEAD GRUNGE KID A dollar total. Or a dollar each? \nCHRISTINE Each, I hope. \nJOLIE (DISTURBED) That's a rumor, duh. They just took photos. \nCHRISTINE How do you know? Were you there? \nJOLIE I heard. \nREDHEAD GRUNGE KID Believe what you want man. That chick got gang banged! Turned out by mad dudes like a straight porno scene. \nJolie, lost in thought. The bell rings. \nINT. HISPANIC HALL \nDim. No windows. \nHispanic kids line the lockers. \nPants sag and Spanish is heard. \nOne black kid from the team, Arius, looks in a locker mirror and puts on cologne. He has a gold cross and greasy hair. \nARIUS Jolie. I heard your old girl is a straight chicken-head. \nJOLIE Who? \nARIUS You haven't heard? \nARIUS Heard what? \nARIUS That Maple Ave shit. You haven't seen the porn video with your girl Henrietta? \nJOLIE I'm not with that girl man. I just tutor her in Algebra. \nARIUS Chill brother. I'm just saying... \nMR. APPLEBAUM overhears this. \nMR. APPLEBAUM What are you boys buzzing about? Maple Ave this.. Maple Ave that.. \nARIUS You can take the niggas out the ghetto but you can't take the ghetto out the niggas. \nMR. APPLEBAUM Come on Arius. I know you've got somewhere to be. \nStill stunned by the rumor, Jolie follows the steady flow of kids out a single door to the: \nEXT. EAST SIDE OF THE SCHOOL - DAY \nThe sun backlights the school. \nJolie emerges from the school. Christine catches up to him. \nCHRISTINE Jolie, aren't you headed to computer class? \nJOLIE What? Yeah. \nCHRISTINE Is everything alright? You look kind of stunned or something. \nJOLIE What? No. I just. The sun was in my eyes. \nCHRISTINE Oh. \nJOLIE What's up? \nCHRISTINE I am totally struggling with my program this month, do you think I could look at your code? \nJOLIE My programming skills aren't that good. But we can copy Haroon's code and just change the variable names. \nCHRISTINE Really? \nJOLIE Yea. \nCHRISTINE Cool. Thanks. \nChristine gives Jolie a hug. \nCRACK - the sound of softball being hit. \nThe girls team warming up. \nJolie and Christine sit on small metal bleachers. \nCHRISTINE You guys have the late practice today, huh? \nJOLIE Yeah. \nCHRISTINE Well Coach Dale asked me to tape the next game - you wanna see the camera we're using? It's in the small gym. \nJOLIE Oh yeah. All the way past C hall. \nCHRISTINE Come on. I know a short cut through parenting class. \nJOLIE Through parenting class? Let's just go the long way. \nCHRISTINE Come on. Don't be such a goody goody. The teacher doesn't care. Trust me. She's like a hundred years old, she gets it. It's just an excuse to have free baby sitters for all the teen moms. And that's a good thing. \nShe grabs his hand and leads him. \nINT. PARENTING CLASSROOM \nJolie and Christine cut through the chaotic after school `class.' \nHenrietta is there, looking bored, and playing with a toy toddler. \nHenrietta gives Jolie a suspicious look. \nJolie waves nervously. \nCHRISTINE Are you friends with her? That's the girl I was telling you about. \nJOLIE I just tutor her in Algebra. You know how we need community service hours to graduate, well... \nINT. BLAZER GYMNASIUM \nA mural of fire emblazons the walls. \nA second floor balcony - overlooking the court. A space for storing of moldy old trampolines and gymnastic junk. \nJOLIE It's hot as a mug in here. \nChristine flips on a giant standing fan. \nCHRISTINE Stand in front of this. God that feels good. \nHer hair and cheerleader skirt blowing back. Jolie stands next to her. \nChristine gracefully gets on her knees. Beat. \nCHRISTINE The camera's under here. Come on. \nShe crawls under the trampoline, through the glittery tassels hanging around it's edges. \nJolie hesitates then follows but we stay behind. A pom-pom and a basketball rest in the foreground. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) The season hadn't even started and my life had changed forever. \nJust below the tassels Christine's top lands on the floor. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) I swear, exactly when we kissed someone yelled score. \nKids of all shapes and sizes rush the court below with hockey sticks. Haroon and Vlad and Benjamin and Anya, and the Redhead Grunge Kid and Ray among them. \nREDHEAD GRUNGE KID Score! Score! Score! \nRAY Shut your hole! \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) It felt like a million bucks. \nHaroon pumps his fist yes as someone gets a shot past the goalie in warm ups. \nChristine fixes her hair and walks out with a VHS camcorder. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) I felt guilty cuz of Henrietta, but as Tu Pac says, \"Only God can judge me.\" \nJOLIE Done. \nHaroon has fires up a video game on the PC. \nHAROON Cool. Now let's conquor titen again. I think we can break the high score. \nZEKE Seriously. \nINT. RUSTY OLD HIGH SCHOOL WEIGHT ROOM - DAY \nEvery kid on the team but Jolie is wearing light tan, su\u00e8de Timberland boots. \nWENDEL What's up? \nJOLIE Hey. \nARIUS What's up Jolie. \nJOLIE What's up? \nMERLY What's up? What's up with you? \nJOLIE What's up? \nCODROY What's up? \nJOLIE What's up? \nSURGIO Chillen. \nWENDEL Peace, nigger. \nJolie pauses for a second then half smiles. \nHaroon's face turns red as a cherry as he \"maxes\" on the bench. \nJOLIE See man. Ray can't mess with us now. We're rolling too deep. \nHaroon looks around, the whole basketball team is working out. \nMERLY leg presses a massive amount of weight. \nHAROON (dons his sombrero, spreading a genuine SMILE) Yea. I guess your right. Junior year's actually gonna be cool. And I love spirit week. Merly, did you bring a hat for hat day? \nMERLY Yea. \nMerly stops his leg presses - pulls on a black ski-mask. \nMERLY Hey, Jolie. Want to give us a lift to Taco Bell for lunch? \nJOLIE Yea. No prob. \nHAROON Cool man. \nEXT. STUDENT PARKING LOT - DAY \nKids from the team pile into Jolie's Toyota Camry. \nSix are already in the ride, Haroon tries to squeeze in. \nMERLY You want my spot? \nHAROON Ummm. Naw. Naw. I'm cool. \nMERLY You sure? \nJOLIE Jump in the trunk dude. It's not far. \nHAROON You think so? \nMERLY That's rediculous. Let's just bring you back something? What do you want? \nHAROON Uh. Just like a couple burritos. Here's a ten? \nMERLY No worries. I got you. \nHAROON Oh thanks man. \nHenrietta rolls her eyes and looks upset. \nHENRIETTA Jolie. I saw Christine was all over you at school. \nJOLIE She's just like that. She's a cheerleader. \nHENRIETTA Tell me something. What do you really want to do with your life? \nJOLIE What do I want to do? \nHENRIETTA Why do you repeat everything I say? \nJOLIE What do I wanna do? I mean, you know that, right? \nHENRIETTA You're five-eight. \nJOLIE Spud Web was five seven. \nHENRIETTA Jolie. \nJOLIE What? \nHenrietta's father Mr. Aaronson, rolls up in a VW van and speaks from the window. \nMR. AARONSON So what's happening kids? Haroon said you guys were talking about important stuff? \nHENRIETTA Dad, we're fucking studying here! Do you mind? \nMR. AARONSON In the parking lot? I just wanted to see if you guys needed anything. I made Rice Krispy treats. They're still hot. \nHe showcases a saran wrapped tray. \nHENRIETTA Dad, have you seen how fucking fat I am!? \nMR. AARONSON Henrietta. Just because you don't want any doesn't mean Jolie doesn't. Tutoring is hard work, after all. (TO JOLIE) I tutored high school kids in Oakland in the 60's, and - \nHENRIETTA Dad, we all know the story of you saving kids in the ghetto, ok? \nMR. AARONSON Jolie, are you hungry? \nJOLIE UH- \nHENRIETTA Jolie's bailing, Dad. Come on. \nHenrietta hops into the Van. \nMR. AARONSON Oh. Well. That's cool. That's cool. \nHenrietta looks bummed. She cups her stomach and looks at it. Then scowls at Jolie. \nJOLIE I'm really sorry, Mr. Aaronson, but- \nHENRIETTA Dad. Just drive please. \nMR. AARONSON No worries, Jolie. Catch you later. \nMr. Aaronson makes the West coast gang sign as a friendly gesture as a good-bye as he drives off. \nJolie and Haroon watch them leave. \nINT. METRO - NIGHT \nThe train rumbles along. \nHAROON So you've been tutoring her in Algebra and that's it? \nJOLIE Yea. \nHAROON Whatever man. \nJOLIE What? \nHAROON I was sitting right there. \nJOLIE So? \nHAROON So man. I saw what was going on. I'm not an idiot. \nARIUS Man, Francisco is in the papers. You haven't seen? (turns and tugs at a CHEERLEADER) Come here, girl. Sit on my lap. \nWendel lights a cig. \nJolie lays a towel over his head and turns to Wendel. \nJOLIE Henrietta didn't really fuck any of them, did she? I mean she was just posing nude for some photos, right? \nWENDEL Well, they just paid her to do a little strip tease or whatever but things escalated. \nJOLIE How can it just escalate? \nWENDEL How did World War 2 escalate? It just did. Someone pulled out his junk teasing her, and then she started messing around with her tongue on his balls, just laughing and stuff. And it just went from there. \nJOLIE Dude? If this is a psych, you got me. OK? Just tell me the truth. \nWENDEL I'm not lying. I'm dead serious. You can see for yourself. \nJOLIE It got erased I thought. \nWENDEL The original did. But Arius has a copy. \nJolie tugs on his underarm hair, worried. \nThey look over at Arius who is daydreaming. \nARIUS (TO HIMSELF) Booooom. \nWENDEL Arius! \nArius snaps out of it. \nWENDEL What happened to your head man? \nARIUS The doctors said I was crazy so they took a little piece of my brain out. \nWENDEL No they didn't. \nARIUS Yes they did. Look. \nArius shows off the top of his head \nJOLIE Damn. \nCLOSE ON: Arius's brutal scar in his head. Arius pushes at it with his fingers. \nARIUS See how soft it is? \nJOLIE Yeah. \nArius laughs. Looks around to make sure no one's listening in. \nARIUS Come by Coach Dales office tomorrow at 3 o'clock. (MORE) \nARIUS (CONT'D) While he's gone opening up the weight-room I'm showing the tape for five bucks a head. You have never seen anything like this, I promise you. \nA yellow Geo Jeep with 5 very thugged out kids rolls up. \nARIUS Arright y'all. \nArius gives them the finger from the packed with 6 Jeep as it speeds off (Geo's are equipt with only 4 seats) \nINT. CLASSROOM - DAY \nEveryone working away - Haroon and Jolie seated in the back with a giant stand alone magnifying glass. \nThe teacher MR. APPLEBAUM puts a paper on Jolie's desk labeled B+, then Haroon's, labeled B-. \nHAROON B minus!? Are you serious? \nMR. APPLEBAUM Watch the language Mister Mochtarzada. \nHAROON Did you even read this shit? \nMR. APPLEBAUM Thin ice Haroon. \nHAROON Come on Mr. Applebaum? The whole undercover hooker bust opening in this thing is genius. \nGUY BEHIND THE CAMERA What would your daddy say if he saw this? \nHENRIETTA (affecting a sexy voice) He'd knock me out for the rest of my life. \nThe kids in the room break out into ad-lib excitement. \nARIUS Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Look. Right there. That's Francisco in the back. \nIn the background of the video is a doorway to a hallway, and crouched on the floor as if waiting for a long time, is Francisco. \nCHRISTINE Coach Dale is coming. I'm serious. He's coming now. \nWendel flips on the Sega Genesis. John Madden '95 appears on the screen. \nChristine and Wendel each grab a controller. \nCoach Dale enters. \nCOACH DALE No weightroom today guys, we got some studying to do. This is a copy of last years Springbrook game. Get comfortable, this could be a while. \nThe cheerleaders gather themselves. \nCoach Dale tries to insert the game tape but the VHS of Henrietta is still inside. He ejects the mystery tape, looks at it, unlabeled, and puts it in his bag. \nCOACH DALE (cont.) Girls, you are welcome to watch but please keep it down, we have our work cut out for us. \nThe cheerleaders leave, Christine the last to straggle along, grabs Jolie's hand briefly on the way out. \nCoach Dale turn off the lights and presses play on the game tape. \nArius considers swiping the VHS. So does Jolie. But there's no opportunity. \nThe low quality recording of a game plays: one pixilated, long take. \nThe blue team scores. The white team - THE BLAZERS - in-bound the ball, and the camera pans following the action. The video as primitive as it gets. \nJolie is in a daze about what has seen with Henrietta. \nCoach Dale pauses the tape. \nCOACH DALE Now what was wrong with that shot? (BEAT) Jolie? \nARIUS He shot on the first pass of a half court set. \nCOACH DALE Are you Jolie? \nARIUS (scowling at the coach) Do I look like white to you? \nBeat. \nCoach Dale assails Arius, wrestling him into a hold on the floor. \nCOACH DALE How does it feel? \nARIUS Owwww. My arm. \nThe other players stand back feeling awkward about the semi- abusive coach. \nCOACH DALE How does it feel? \nARIUS Ah. Ah. Ah. \nCOACH DALE Look in my eyes. How does it feel? \nARIUS Ahhhhhh! \nCOACH DALE If I ever see you back away from a rebound again I'm gonna bench you for the season. You wont play one second the whole year. You got that boy? \nArius pinned and cringing squirms, eyes tearing, shirt bunching up and revealing a tatoo on his back for \"Maple Ave.\" \nWhile everyone's distracted Jolie eyes the bag with the VHS, inching closer. Just as he's about to make his move the coach release Arius and sits back down. \nThen he pounces on Arius again and Jolie quickly grab the tape. \nARIUS Ahhhhh! \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nHold. \nINT. FOOTLOCKER \nAs Chris Rock would say, Jolie, Christine and Haroon are in the mall `white people used to go to.' \nJolie takes a suede Timberland boot off the shelf. \nJOLIE Dude, I was thinking about getting some Tims. \nHAROON So what? \nJOLIE So you haven't noticed all the kids on the team wear them? \nCHRISTINE Duh. \nHAROON Man, with sandals you never have to tie your shoes. That's all I'm saying. \nJolie sizes up the boot next to his foot and looks in the mirror. \nJOLIE Do you have these in a size ten. And bring a what - (looks to Haroon) Size 7? Yeah size seven for Haroon. \nFootlocker kid nods and goes. \nHAROON I told you, man, I don't want Tims. I'm a sandals guy. Like Jesus. And Muhammad. \nHaroon sits down defeated and looks in the mirror. \nCHRISTINE You'd look good in them, Haroon. You should try them on. Come on. Be cool. \nHaroon looks at his toes, wiggles them. \nChristine and Jolie french kiss as the Footlocker Kid returns with three boxes of shoes, stopping short to watch Jolie and Christine make-out. Haroon looks away sheepishly. \nBegin the make out montage: \nEXT. BLAZERS GYM PARKING LOT - DUSK \nRun down gravel plot built to fit fifteen cars. Empty except for Jolie and Christine. \nWendel and Arius driving off in a bright yellow Geo jeep packed with 7 other kids. \nChristine and Jolie are french kissing. Both wearing their Timberland boots. \nEXT. BEAUTIFUL CEMETERY - NIGHT \nOn the bank of a stream. \nJolie unzips Christine's daisy dukes under the moonlight and traces her exposed skin with the tips of his fingers. \nEXT. EMPTY \"SAFEWAY\" GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nDrizzling. \nJolie's Toyota Camry is fogged up, and there are feet in the window. \nINT. TACO BELL - NIGHT \nJolie and Christine are kissing. \nCASHIER Anything else with that? \nWe see Christine slip Jolie a lot of tongue. \nEXT. TACO BELL PARKING LOT - DAY \nJolie and Christine walk out of the bell. \nMR. AARONSON Jolie. \nJolie turns to see Mr. Aaronson and Henrietta in their VW van. Henrietta sits all the way in the back wearing headphones. \nJOLIE Mr. Aaronson. \nHENRIETTA Dad. \nMR. AARONSON What's up? You kids want anything from the Bell. \nCHRISTINE Hurry up. \nJOLIE Dang. I don't see one here. \nCHRISTINE What? \nJOLIE Well maybe we can just do it a little bit. \nCHRISTINE No way. \nChristine rolls over. \nJolie is still for a moment. \nJOLIE (WHISPERS) I won't even do it. I'll just feel it. \nJolie nestles close to her. \nBeat. \nThe sheets move. \nChristine lightly moans. \nCHRISTINE (BARELY AUDIBLE) Oh. \nThe covers begin to shuffle \nCLOSE ON: Jolie's closed eyes. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. FANTASY SMOKE FILLED BASKETBALL COURT \nA spotlit Jolie dribbling down a seemingly endless court. \nFaint roars of an unseen sell-out crowd cheer him on. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) In my head I kept thinking about dribbling a basketball down an endless basketball court, playing point guard in the biggest game of the year. The Springbrook game. \nA spotlit Christine does a cartwheel followed by a split. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) That kept me focused so I wouldn't bust in about two seconds. \nJolie looks down at his soiled pants, forgetting his basketball that bounces off into darkness. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) I was gonna pull out but... \nThree old white referees, also spotlit, are blowing their whistles and pointing furiously at Jolie as they charge closer, revealing they all have the face of Mr. Aaronson. \nBACK TO: \nINT. JOLIE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT \nJolie's face of extreme worry. \nJOLIE Uh, I better not keep going. \nCHRISTINE (under her breath) Oh. Fuck. \nSilence. \nChristine takes a few second to cool off. \nCHRISTINE Have any music we can listen to? \nJOLIE Yea. \nJolie grabs some sheets around him and walks over to desk with CDs and junk. In a sneeky manor he grabs a tissue and wipes himself clean, then grabs a Handi-Snacks wrapper and throws them in the trash together. \nThen he pulls out an All Eyes on Me CD. We get a long close up of the cover. \nThe music begins to play. \nJolie and Christine cuddle. \nCHRISTINE Do you ever wish you were Tu Pac? \nARIUS My fucking gut. I'm bleeding all over my fucking Guess. My Guess shit man! \nRAY Ah fuck man. I'm OK. I think I'm OK. \nA large crowd has gathered around the blood and broken window in the aftermath of a fight. \nARIUS Ah shit, man! Ahhh! My fucking gut is burning! \nJOLIE Holly shit. You need help. Someone call an ambulance. \nHAROON Whoa dude. That is a lot of blood. Where is he going? \nJOLIE I dunno. \nArius hobbles around leaving a trail of blood on the linoleum tiles as Principal Ganus and Mr. Applebaum appear on the scene and hold him up. \nPRINCIPAL GANUS An ambulance is on the way. \nArius is hobbled out. Ray is shepparded off by Mr. Applebaum.. \nA trail of small spats of blood across the linoleum floor. \nPrincipal Ganus is surveying the scene with a few of the kids who were present. \nINT. PACKED BLAZER GYM - NIGHT \nThe crowd is filled with energy. \nBrightly lit.   A home game. Everything is red, white, and black. \nThe glossy floor shines like it has just been polished. \nGo-go music, blasting over the sub-par audio system, fades out. \nThe fifteen Blair Blazers in their red and white warm ups have taken center court for a ritual. \nHuddled in a pack, hunched over and jumbled together with their arms around each other, swaying back and forth, they get pumped up: \nWENDEL Who's house? \nWHOLE TEAM OUR HOUSE! \nWENDEL Who's house? \nWHOLE TEAM OUR HOUSE! \nWENDEL Who's house? \nWHOLE TEAM OUR HOUSE! \nAd-lib hollers in excitement as the huddle breaks and they head for the bench. \nPlayers wipe the soles of their shoes on the way over. \nCOACH DALE OK, starting five. Let's go. \nFive players shed their warm ups and gather on the bench. Jolie is one of the starters. \nCOACH DALE OK, we're gonna come out in a twenty-two going black on made buckets. Wendel and Jolie up front. \nEveryone puts their hands in together in a circle. \nCOACH DALE Defense on three. \nWENDEL Defense on three. One! Two! Three! \nLATER \nThe bench players have formed an entry way for the starters to take the court. \nOn a crappy microphone: \nANNOUNCER Starting at point guard. Number twenty two. Joel \"Jolie\" Jolson. \nJolie trots the isle of his teammates. Wendel stoically slaps fives and gives pounds as he takes center floor. \nHe takes in the experience - looking at the huge crowd in the stands around him. All applauding. \nThey pass a Black Volvo and an old Red Volkswagen Bug and Golden Retriever sleeping in the yard. \nThey hop into the Minivan. Jolie takes a big bite of the rice crispy treat as they drive past a \"speed hump\" sign. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) It must have been good for Henrietta too, because afterwords, she didn't mention joining the team to the Bowe fight, she didn't mention Christine, she didnt mention nothing. \nAs they drive off Jolie looks back at Henrietta's home getting smaller and smaller. A speed hump sign in the foreground, and a basketball hoop set up on the street. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) Still though, I was worried she'd show anyway. If she did, I didn't know what I was gonna do. \nEXT. CITY PLACE MALL - NIGHT \nWide, dark, empty streets, lit up by pools of light from street lamps. \nHaroon and Jolie cross to: Muhammad Ali's Chicken, a restaurant with TV's in the windows, and a color scheme of red, black, and white. \nHAROON So she was just pissed because you didn't invite her to this? \nJOLIE Yeah. \nHAROON But it sounds like she was really freaking out. I mean you said she smashed their PC. \nJOLIE Yeah, when I first got there she didn't even have any clothes on. (MORE) \nJOLIE (CONT'D) She threw her pajamas into the fireplace. I swear to God. \nHAROON I don't know. I mean maybe something more is going on? \nThey pass a BLIND BLACK MAN in a black suit poking around a seeing-eye stick, trying to orient himself. \nHAROON (CONT'D) I mean, she's pregnant and it sounds like she's keeping the baby. Like she's fulfilling some need or something. \nJOLIE Yeah - the need for something. \nThey cackle. \nHAROON You wear a condom right? \nJOLIE I don't have to. She's pregnant. \nThey laugh harder. \nHAROON Ah man. Ah man. That is crazy. \nINT. CITY PLACE MALL \nThey enter and their demeanors shift - they both affect bravado. \nHAROON (SOFTLY) Have you ever been here? \nJOLIE (SOFTLY) Not for a fight? \nINT. MUHAMMAD ALI'S CHICKEN \nHaroon and Jolie walk threw looking for their friends; we take in the setting as they do. \nAn old dude finishes a coke through a straw; we hear the loud bubbling noise. The giant plastic cup has a picture of Muhammad Ali in his prime. \nB & W Muhammad Ali posters fill the walls. Ali stands in glory over his unconscious opponents, or lays blows to their faces, sweat frozen in the air as it flies from their bodies. \nThe food is laid out cafeteria style. The tables and booths are a step above any fast food joint. Televisions hang from every angle, some even face the streets to attract pedestrians. \nOn every television, without exception: a boxing match. Bowe versus a large white guy, Golota. \nWatching are about a hundred and fifty black people of all ages, mostly male, packing the restaurant. \nThe crowd subdued by the early rounds. \nJolie finds his friends from the team and their girlfriends lining the shinny metal railing that guides people along the buffet style assortment of chicken and biscuits. \nJolie is the only white person in the whole spot. \nCHRISTINE Hey. \nJOLIE Hey. \nCHRISTINE Did you see those guys who killed Jordan's Dad got life? \nA couple of kids are slammed loudly against the window in the excitement. \nThrough the glass Jolie can hear: \nBLACK GIRL We won! We won! We won! \nSUPERIMPOSE in the top left corner in white letters: OJ Simpson was just found not guilty. \nThe hallway is growing into total commotion and chaos. \nJolie walks through the doorway into the hall and the camera follows without a cut. \nJolie looks out of place as he takes it all in. \nThe wild scene rages. \nJolie looks back into the main office. \nRay comes out of Principal Ganus's door. His eyes red from tears, he curses to himself. \nPrincipal Ganus emerges, acknowledges the commotion in the hallway. \nPRINCIPAL GANUS What the hell is going on out there? \nJOLIE OJ Simpson....not guilt. \nPrincipal Ganus is stone faced. He gestures Jolie into his office. \nRay brushes shoulders with Jolie. \nRAY You're dead. \nPRINCIPAL GANUS Look who you're stepping to, Ray. A little white boy? \nRay blows it off. \nPRINCIPAL GANUS (BEAT) Jolie. Come with me. \nINT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE \nPRINCIPAL GANUS Look. I'm not proud of what happened in that gym. \nSurrounded by proud school ornaments and paraphernalia. \nJolie sits alone in a chair, an empty chair adjacent him. \nPRINCIPAL GANUS Everyone who was caught fighting is being suspended for a minimum of three days. And that includes most of the team. But a suspension for you would only tarnish the reputation of the Magnet program. So... \nPrincipal Ganus thumbs through a manila envelope. \nPRINCIPAL GANUS You're going to do this school a favor, (BEAT) at the international math meet. \nHe hands Jolie a form. \nPRINCIPAL GANUS You were great your freshman year. Your calculus teacher tells me your still great, but for some reason you quit. \nJOLIE I made JV that year. \nPRINCIPAL GANUS Well, there's going to be no rematch of the Springbrook playoff game. Both teams are forfeiting. So now you've got plenty of time, that's for damn sure. \nJOLIE They're not rescheduling our game? That's insane. \nPRINCIPAL GANUS The math team needs you Jolie. We're on the verge of nationals. (MORE) \nPRINCIPAL GANUS (cont'd) This year we settles for nothing less than number one, second to none. (BEAT) In whole numbers. \nThe principal laughs at his own joke. \nPRINCIPAL GANUS You can go now. \nStunned, Jolie grabs his bag and heads for the door. \nPRINCIPAL GANUS Oh, one more thing. You will also join the team for an additional 40 hours of community service, as part of the new \"Adopt a Highway\" Program. It's part of the team punishment. \nINT. BALZERS HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY \nJOLIE It's not fair man. I mean everyone got suspended on the team but me. Just because I'm in the Magnet. \nJOLIE (V.O., cont.) I told them all it was Haroon who spray-painted `Free Mike Tyson,' and even he was cool too. \nHaroon, half asleep, sparking the tail end of a blunt. \nJOLIE (V.O., cont.) We even smoked a blunt. It was our first time gettng blazed and drunk. \nSoda cans, crumbs, bags of chips, and other treats and wrappers are scattered around. \nOn the television: the audience laughs wildly at a Monkey doing sign language on the Carson show. \nJOHNNY CARSON (ON TELEVISION) What's he saying now? What's he signing? \nThe guest interprets. \nGUEST (ON TELEVISION) He wants to say he loves you all, and he wishes he could hang onto these people a little longer, connect with them a little deeper, before it's all over. \nThe Carson crowd laughs wildly. \nJolie's hand slides up Christine's skirt. \nCHRISTINE (WHISPERING) Jolie! No way. Not until you know what. \nJOLIE (WHISPERING) Don't worry. \nCHRISTINE (WHISPERING) When? You've been saying you're gonna get your Dad's credit card for like a month. Time is of the essence here, duh. \nJOLIE (WHISPERING) I told you I'm on it. First thing when my parents get back. But this is the best time to do it because we dont have to wear a condom. Come on, let's go upstairs. Trust me. \nHe reaches back up her skirt. \nCHRISTINE (WHISPERING) No means no, Jolie. \nChristine pushes him away. \nHaroon comes out of the bathroom. \nHAROON (WHISPERING) Dude. I am blazed out of my mind right now, but I think someone's hiding in your shower? \nJOLIE (WHISPERING) Forreal? \nHAROON (WHISPERING) Yeah, dude. Check it. \nJolie grabs a portable phone, bracing himself for battle. \nINT. BATHROOM \nJOLIE Who's there? \nHENRIETTA Jolie. \nJOLIE Damn Henrietta. You scared the shit out of me. \nHENRIETTA How could you? \nShe opens the curtains. \nJOLIE What? What are you doing in my basement bathroom? \nHENRIETTA I'm catching you cheating with Christine! You asshole! \nJOLIE Shhh. People are sleeping. \nHENRIETTA Don't lie to me. You think I dont know shit. She's pregnant with your baby. \nJOLIE Whao. \nHENRIETTA You think the Maple Ave. kids don't hear mad junk about the Magnet kids. \nJOLIE Henrietta, relax. \nHENRIETTA I know about all that stuff, how y'all hooked up during floor hockey intramurals under the trampoline. Everything. You think I don't have friends? I have friends! \nHenrietta starts crying. \nJOLIE Come on, I know you have friends Henrietta. \nHENRIETTA You think I'm a fool? I watched you make out with her on the Power-pad two second ago! \nJOLIE Wow. \nARIUS Yeah. This is the future right here. \nJOLIE Why wont it go play or whatever? \nARIUS Bandwidth. \nJOLIE (CONFUSED) Oh yea. \nJolie tokes a blunt. \nArius takes a last puff and puts it out. \nA little cute six year old girl comes out of the bedroom with a sheet of paper and pencil. \nCUTE GIRL Arius. Who was the first president of the United States? \nARIUS Uh, George Washington. \nShe runs back into the bedroom. \nARIUS So. That's what it's all about. I'm a capital venturist man. Internet porn is the future of sexual healing. Henrietta was just the first of many. It's big business. Dollar bills man. \nJolie looks on, stoned. Not sure what to make of it all. \nEXT. THE BELTWAY - DAWN \nA six lane highway banks a sharp curve. It's raining lightly. \nOn the shoulder of the highway are kids from the Blair Basketball team picking up trash with pokers. They are spread out - a kid every 25 yards or so - and together they extend clear around the curve and out of sight. \nJolie pokes a Coke can. \nJolie plucks the can off the end metal nail and realizes he also stabbed the tape liner notes of MC Hammer's \"Please Hammer Don't Hurt'em.\" There is a picture of Hammer on the cover. \nThe coach sits in a nearby van with its lights on, parked in the shoulder. He sips hot coffee, watching. \nJolie looks closely at the tape insert. \nIt's a picture of Hammer but someone has scratched out his eyes with a pen. And the poker has put a hole through his face. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) I wasn't sure what to make of it all. Why Henrietta's parents never know she was pregant until too late? Or why I never said something myself? It was like none of it really mattered, or was even real at all, until it was too late. \nCLOSE ON: An old PC monitor. A picture slowly emerging from a blurry pixilated square of colors. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) After that I used the internet to find a bunch of places that would take Henrietta's baby up for adoption. It wasn't easy, but I found all the information right from Haroon's basement, using Netscape. \nThe picture of a couple materializes: hopeful parents and their profile. \nINT. HAROON'S SECOND HOME - DAY \nHAROON This couple looks good. \nJOLIE Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're perfect. All I have to do is convince Henrietta. \nHAROON Are you guys still on good terms? \nJOLIE I don't know. Our sessions are in the kitchen now. \nAdreseis enters. \nADRESEIS We got the trampoline set-up. Come on. \nThey make their way to the back yard. \nEXT. HAROON'S BACKYARD - DAY \nHaroon's brothers have set up a trampoline to dunk on an adjustable rim lowered to 8 ft. \nThe younger brothers do an awesome array of dunks. Jolie and Haroon sit on the side. \nJOLIE (BUMMED) It's weird, I don't really care if I make the NBA anymore. \nHAROON Really? What do you care about then? \nJOLIE I don't know. \n", "test1_input": "JOLIE (VOICE OVER) And just like that, with Marley arrested and Arius doing in-school, I might just get some playing time? \nINT. TRIG CLASS \nHaroon enters and sits next to Jolie. \nHaroon has double fresh black eyes. \nThe teacher and classroom is quite and dont even pay any attention to Jolie entering. \nHAROON I thought you said Ray wasn't gonna mess with me man? \nJOLIE Woah. Dude. Are you alright? \nHAROON Do I look alright? \nJOLIE I'm sorry man. \nHAROON That's all you got? \nJOLIE No. Come on man. \nHAROON YOu said I just had to hold my ground. \nJOLIE Well at least you've still got your teeth. \nHAROON You're an asshole. \nJOLIE Let me get you back. Come to the movies with me tonight dude. The new Ice Tea flick is out. The tickets on me. Coke, popcorn, the whole nine. \nHaroon rolls his eyes and shakes his head. \nHAROON The whole nine? It's a movie. \nJOLIE It's an Ice Tea flick and it's gonna be tight as a mug. \nHaroon looks disgusted and offended. \nINT. DARK GHETTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT \nHenrietta leans in close to Jolie's ear. They whisper to each OTHER: \nJOLIE We had an early game today against Paint Branch. And I scored 3 points. \nHENRIETTA You know I saw you with that Cheerleader. \nJOLIE Come on. Enough with that. I washed my hands already. So I can please you. \nHENRIETTA Just tell me yall are hooking up. It's OK if you are. I just want the truth. \nJOLIE You want the truth. How is this? \nJolie reveals a plastic case meant for baseball cards. Out of it he slides a small newspaper cut out. \nA picture of Francisco getting arrested with the headline `Sex Video Arrest.' \nHENRIETTA (ASHAMED) Yeah. Francisco got arrested. What about it? \nJOLIE I thought you said you didn't fuck any of them. \nHENRIETTA I didn't. \nJOLIE Did you suck their dicks? \nHENRIETTA Jolie. It's none of your fucking business. \nJOLIE Well everyone at school says you did. And now they're saying there's a video and that's why Francisco and Merly got arrested. \nHENRIETTA They're not arrested. They got questioned and shit and then they got suspended. \nJOLIE How do you know? \nHENRIETTA Because I hear all the Maple Ave stuff. \nHaroon pretends to watch the movie but is obviously uncomfortable. \nHAROON Shhh. It's getting good you know. \n", "test1_true": "HENRIETTA Look, that's all beside the point. Whatever you heard about me at school, they don't know shit. It's a lie. I already told you. I ran away from home. That's it. Now leave me alone. \nJOLIE Why did you let them take pictures? \nHENRIETTA I told you. I needed money. \nJOLIE For what? \nHENRIETTA Duh, an abortion. Does that make you feel better. But I decided I want this baby Jolie. I want a real family. So I went to Pizza Hut for dinner instead. The one on University Boulevard, do you want a receipt or something? \nJOLIE Where did you sleep that night? \nHENRIETTA I told you. I slept at the ATM machine. Now stop it. \nHenrietta is on the verge of tears and it cracks Jolie. \nJOLIE Dang. I know. I'm sorry. I'm such an idiot. \nHENRIETTA But I love you. I just want to be with you now. And put all that in the past. \nJOLIE Why didn't you come to me then? \nHENRIETTA We had just met. \nJOLIE I know. Damn it. You could have slept on my couch, easy. My parents wouldn't have even cared. \nWe hear a killing on the screen. \nThey kiss. \nThe color cast on them shifts from a blue to a red. Jolie reaches under the starter jacket that lies across her lap. \nHENRIETTA Jolie. No. \nJOLIE You lied to me. \nHENRIETTA I didn't. I would never. \nJOLIE How do I know? \nHenrietta guides his hand up between her legs and she closes her eyes, succumbing to his fingers. \nHENRIETTA Don't you trust me? \nFrom behind them they are silhouettes against the Ice-T action pic \"Surviving the Game.\" \nA baby is crying somewhere in the theater. \nThe red light cast on them begins to flash rapidly. In and out of blackness. \nJolie peaks at a boy one seat away. (Jolie's basketball is in the seat between them, with Haroon's Batman toy sitting atop it.) \nHenrietta breathes hard. \nJolie bites his lower lip. \nANONOMOUS MAN (O.C. yelling at the SCREEN) Don't mess with his boy? You're gonna get it now! Un-hun! \nEXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT \nJOLIE Haroon and I better get going. We gotta finish our Magnet project for R&E. \nHENRIETTA Jolie, my Dad is picking us up. I thought you were gonna help me study? \nJOLIE I would but I can't. This is like the biggest project of the year. \nHENRIETTA I have a huge test tomorrow and if I don't pass this class I have to go to summer school. \nJOLIE I know but Mr. Donaldson just assigned a huge thing- \nHENRIETTA Haroon. Would you mind letting me talk to Jolie in private? \nEXT. BEHIND THE MALL DUMPSTERS \nHENRIETTA The only time we go out is to the movies, and you're always late, and it's always the late show. \nJOLIE What are you talking about? \n", "test1_id": 1764, "test2_input": "Jolie and Elliott eat ice cream - they both look very tired. \nJolie lies on the couch, still in uniform. \nThe late nights lurid news plays on a small white television. \nMALE NEWS ANCHOR (on the television) They said 'had they known it was Jordan's Dad they never would have done it...' \nFEMALE NEWS ANCHOR If only they had seen the license plate... Airness, they might have known. \nOn the TV: Jordan's Dad's Red Lexus 400, parked, now with a smashed back window as well. The shot zooms into the license plate - AIRNESS. \nThe phone rings. \nElliott checks the circa 90's caller ID - a separate box wired to the phone. \nELLIOTT The Aaronsons? At this hour? Should I get it? \nJOLIE I don't know? \nELLIOTT (ANSWERS) Hello. \nEXT. JOLIE'S HOME - NIGHT \nJolie in his uniform and Timberland boots, and his Dad Elliott in boxers, a T-shirt and barefoot, run to the minivan. \nELLIOTT They think only you can talk her off the ledge. \nJolie looks like a deer in headlights. \nJOLIE Why me? \nELLIOTT That's what she said. \nJOLIE Really? Dang. \nELLIOTT Well she's not literally on a ledge. Figuratively. Do you know what figuratively means? \nJOLIE Duh. Come on, Dad. Just drive. \nThey hop in the van. \nEXT. STREETS OF TAKOMA PARK \nThe drive past a sign that symbolizes `Caution, Kids at Play.' \nINT. HENRIETTA'S LIVINGROOM \nJolie, still in his pajamas, walks up the steps then stops to look down them with frightened hesitation in his eyes. \nThe four parents look up - some give a few encouraging nods. \nMR. AARONSON You don't have to do this. \nJOLIE Don't worry, I know how to help Henrietta get her shit together. \nELLIOTT Jolie. \nJOLIE Dad. Come on. You know what I mean. \nINT. HENRIETTA'S BEDROOM \nTotal darkness. No TV. No overhead light. Both kids are wearing white. \nHenrietta's stands in front of a mirror, face wet and red from crying. \nJolie hugs her from behind. \nJOLIE Henrietta, your Dad showed me the test. It was bad, but if you get an A on your last exam you'll still pass. \nHe flicks on a soft warm lamp and kisses her neck. \nJOLIE (CONT'D) You just gotta learn to distribute. \nHENRIETTA You really think I don't know how to do that shit? \nJOLIE What? \n", "test2_true": "JOLIE What is it then? You can talk to me. You can tell me anything. \nHENRIETTA I wasn't invited with you guys to the Tyson fight tomorrow. The one on pay TV. I heard everyone was going and I just flipped out. I mean what's the deal? \nJOLIE What? You mean the Bowe fight? \nHENRIETTA Yeah. Bowe, Tyson, whatever. The point is the whole team's going. \nJOLIE Yeah. It's pretty much just a team thing though. \nHENRIETTA No it's not. Wendel, Arius, and Codroy are all bringing girls. \nJOLIE Oh. I didn't know that. Well, why don't I just call you when I figure out what time we're going. \nHENRIETTA Well the fight is at eight, right? \nHenrietta puts her hand on his leg. \nJOLIE Is it? \nHENRIETTA Yeah. And everyone's going to Muhammad Ali's Rotiserie Chicken at City Place. \nShe slides her hand up. \nJOLIE Oh. \nHENRIETTA Yeah. \nJOLIE Well, I don't know. You have a lot of studying. \nUneasy with her advances, Jolie plucks a Cliff Livingston basketball card off the wall. \nJOLIE Cliff Livingston. I forgot about that guy. \nHenrietta goes for a kiss. \nJOLIE Henrietta. Come on? We're not together anymore. \nHENRIETTA (SUDDENLY ANGRY) You know Spud Web only gets a roster spot because he's a circus freak. He shouldn't be there, and that's why he sells tickets. Don't you get it. He's not good, he's just a draw. Is that what you want to be, a circus freak? \nJOLIE He won the dunk contest. The guy's a beast. You're way out of your league. \nHENRIETTA The league is about making money. Jolie, the only reason you even got on varsity is because your Dad paid for the new uniforms. You never would have made it even with Francisco getting arrested. Don't you realize that? \nJOLIE No he didn't. \nHENRIETTA Yes he did. They cost over two thousand dollars. How could you not know that? I mean you made Varsity at Blair after being cut from JV last year. When have you ever seen that happen? \nThe news hits Jolie hard. \nJOLIE That's not true. Where did you hear that? \nHENRIETTA My Dad talking to your dad on the phone in the kitchen. \nJolie looks at his bandaged hand - lost in deep depressing thought. \nHenrietta leans into Jolie. Strokes his leg. Jolie, defeated, leans into her comforting arms. \nHENRIETTA I still love you, though. None of that matters to me. \nHenrietta kisses him. \nHe kisses her back. \nHenrietta's father knocks. \nHENRIETTA Dad, we're studying here! Do you mind? \nMR. AARONSON (OFF SCREEN) Sorry. I just wanted to see if you guys needed anything. \nSilence for a moment as the kids are frozen, then we hear him head down stairs. \nJolie lies down and Henrietta spoons him. They cuddle. \nEXT.

What we have trained for, not just this season, but for you seniors, the last four years. \nCLOSE ON: A ticket torn at the door. One in a long line. \nINT. BLAZERS WEIGHT ROOM \nCoach Dale is directly in front of a stand alone chalk board. \nCOACH DALE (O.S.) Is it unfair that we drew Springbrook in the first round? Yes. Random seeding is only because the sorry white schools complained to the school board about always losing in the first round. When I was younger the regular season meant something around here. \nCoach Dale begins diagraming the board. \nCOACH DALE (CONT'D) But that means nothing now. We gotta go out and play no matter what. We're gonna open in a one- twenty-two. Wendel on the ball, Pistol on the two. Falling back into the half court, we go one- twenty FIVE. Forcing left. Trap and take the throwback.

LOCKERROOM SHOWERS \nThree Cheerleaders drag Jolie, with his bandaged thumb, to the showers. Jolie looks genuinely scared. \nJOLIE Ms. Bart. I know you're the cheerleading coach and all, but this really better be important. I'm supposed to be in the weight- room by now. \nCHEERLEADING COACH You're injured. And like I said, this is more important than any basketball game. This is life or death Jolie. \nThey arrive at the last shower stall - Christine on her knees in tears. \nJOLIE Christine? \nJolie steps into the shower. \nThe Coach leaves them alone. \nCHRISTINE Jolie. I haven't had my period in three months. \nShe sobs. \nJolie gets on his knees. \nJOLIE Well, maybe you should get one of those things and check it out. \nCHRISTINE A pregnancy test? \nJOLIE Yeah. \nCHRISTINE I did. (SHE CRIES) I'm pregnant with your baby. \nShe cries and shivers. \nBeat. \nJOLIE No worries. My Dad will let me put it on his credit card. Trust me. \nShe cries. \nSuddenly Jolie has a face of determination. He unwraps his bandaged thumb and throws it on the floor. \nCHRISTINE Oh God. I'm sorry. \nJOLIE No. It's not your fault. I gotta run though. Let's talk about this after the game, OK? The team needs me. \nChristine nods but clearly wants to refuse. \nCHRISTINE What for? You're injured anyway. \nJOLIE I'm ok though. I can play through it. do you understand. I just gotta do this? \nCHRISTINE What? I just told you I'm pregnant with your baby.

I gotta be light on my feet. \nASSISTANT COACH You make me sick. \nCOACH DALE Bring it in. \nJOLIE My hand is all better. Look. \nJolie takes a ball from an assistant coach and pounds it showing no sign of pain. Then palms it in his bad hand. \nDale stares at him like he's a fool. \nWENDEL Let's go baby! Bring it in. \nThe coaches exit, and the players quiet down for a quick prayer. \nTEAMMATES Hail Mary Full of Grace, the lord is with you, blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. \nARIUS Domination baby! Domination! \nThe team snaps into game mode forming a single file line. \nThe two assistant coaches scramble in with game balls and hand them off to the first and second players in line. Jolie ditches his practice ball and files in. \nThe players start clapping in rhythm. One. One, two. One. One, two. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) That night. I never played. None of us did. Because there never was a game. Before the opening tip even kicked it off a fight between schools broke out in the crowd. Some fired a gun twice, and all hell broke loose. \nEXT.

Was that gun shots? \nELLIOTT I don't know. Stay down just in case. \nFrom the van, Jolie and Elliott see Francisco, Arius and Hunio all running into the woods among the chaos. \nINT. MAIN OFFICE \nLined with windows, yields a view to an empty hall. \nJolie sits, waiting...sees Christine and a couple other cheerleaders, no longer in uniform, pass by. Jolie waves and Christine holds up both hands as if to say \"come on\" and continues walking... \nSuddenly a group of black girls come barreling down the hallway like they are possessed. \nThey are followed in droves by other minorities. \nBlack girls bounce up and down and cry and paw at each other. \nBlack boys and kids of other races, not quite as ecstatic but still amazed join the celebration. \n", "test3_id": 1766}

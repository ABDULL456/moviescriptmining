It's in the small gym. \nJOLIE Oh yeah. All the way past C hall. \nCHRISTINE Come on. I know a short cut through parenting class. \nJOLIE Through parenting class? Let's just go the long way. \nCHRISTINE Come on. Don't be such a goody goody. The teacher doesn't care. Trust me. She's like a hundred years old, she gets it. It's just an excuse to have free baby sitters for all the teen moms. And that's a good thing. \nShe grabs his hand and leads him. \nINT. PARENTING CLASSROOM \nJolie and Christine cut through the chaotic after school `class.' \nHenrietta is there, looking bored, and playing with a toy toddler. \nHenrietta gives Jolie a suspicious look. \nJolie waves nervously. \nCHRISTINE Are you friends with her? That's the girl I was telling you about. \nJOLIE I just tutor her in Algebra. You know how we need community service hours to graduate, well... \nINT. BLAZER GYMNASIUM \nA mural of fire emblazons the walls. \nA second floor balcony - overlooking the court. A space for storing of moldy old trampolines and gymnastic junk. \nJOLIE It's hot as a mug in here. \nChristine flips on a giant standing fan. \nCHRISTINE Stand in front of this. God that feels good. \nHer hair and cheerleader skirt blowing back. Jolie stands next to her. \nChristine gracefully gets on her knees. Beat. \nCHRISTINE The camera's under here. Come on. \nShe crawls under the trampoline, through the glittery tassels hanging around it's edges. \nJolie hesitates then follows but we stay behind. A pom-pom and a basketball rest in the foreground. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) The season hadn't even started and my life had changed forever. \nJust below the tassels Christine's top lands on the floor. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) I swear, exactly when we kissed someone yelled score. \nKids of all shapes and sizes rush the court below with hockey sticks. Haroon and Vlad and Benjamin and Anya, and the Redhead Grunge Kid and Ray among them. \nREDHEAD GRUNGE KID Score! Score! Score! \nRAY Shut your hole! \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) It felt like a million bucks. \nHaroon pumps his fist yes as someone gets a shot past the goalie in warm ups. \nChristine fixes her hair and walks out with a VHS camcorder. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) I felt guilty cuz of Henrietta, but as Tu Pac says, \"Only God can judge me.\" \n", "test1_true": "JOLIE (VOICE OVER) I did wonder if Henrietta's Dad, Mr. Aaronson, even knew she was pregnant. \nJolie takes a last glimpse of the intermural floor hockey game below them. \nJOLIE (VOICE OVER) But for some reason it just never came up. \nJolie ducks into the stairwell. \nThen all the lights go out. \nBlackness. \nHold. \nHaroon walks into a small shaft of light that goes unseen until it has his face to land on. \nHAROON (OFF CAMERA) Would someone please stop messing around and put the lights on. This league is for serious players only. \nHaroon puts on his RoboCop goalie mask. BAM! He is body checked to the floor. \nRAY Boom! Step aside, nigga. \nHaroon slouched against the wall - blood dripping from his temple. \nHAROON (cringing in pain, almost CRYING) Oww, man. I think you broke my wrist. \nRAY Tell your boy Jolie to lay off my girl Christine. Every time he makes a move on her I'm gonna eat your ass for lunch. \nHAROON (beginging to cry) What? Why me? \nINT. HAROON'S HOME - AFTER-SCHOOL DAY \nHaroon, and Haroon's older brother ZEKE are rummaging the kitchen cabinets for snacks. Haroon's arm is in a cast for the rest of the movie. \nZEKE Hey, are there anymore Handi-Snacks or did you take the last one? \nThe doorbell rings. \nEXT. HAROON'S HOME \nJolie and Haroon smack their secret handshake. \nThey cross the lawn with Zeke. \nHAROON Dude, before I show you this internet stuff at my Mom's place we gotta talk about this Raymond situation. Ray said he's gonna eat my ass for lunch every time you mess with Christine. \nHaroon grabs a key from under the doormat of the second home. \nJOLIE Yea he's just afraid to step to me directly because he knows varsity has my back. Don't stress though. He's just a bully. \nHaroon open the door to: \nINT. HAROON'S DIMLY LIT SECOND HOME - DAY \nThick curtains are drawn, most of the place empty but a small computer station is in the corner. \nHAROON Don't stress? He broke my arm man. How is anything under control? \nJOLIE Ray is just a bully. All you have to do is hold your ground a little probably. \nJolie fakes like he gonna punch Haroon and Haroon flinches. \nJOLIE He'll back off. \nHAROON What? Are you serious? He blind sided me. How am I supposed to hold my ground? \nJOLIE Come on dude, isn't that why you always carry that Batman figure around? \nHAROON What? \nJOLIE Because Batman's the only superhero that is just a regular guy. \nHAROON Batman is a cartoon. This TOY is for inspiration. We're talking about real life. Are you loco? \nJOLIE Fine, then just stay close to me and the team will get your back, I swear. \nHAROON Pinky swear.

Airness, they might have known. \nOn the TV: Jordan's Dad's Red Lexus 400, parked, now with a smashed back window as well. The shot zooms into the license plate - AIRNESS. \nThe phone rings. \nElliott checks the circa 90's caller ID - a separate box wired to the phone. \nELLIOTT The Aaronsons? At this hour? Should I get it? \nJOLIE I don't know? \nELLIOTT (ANSWERS) Hello. \nEXT. JOLIE'S HOME - NIGHT \nJolie in his uniform and Timberland boots, and his Dad Elliott in boxers, a T-shirt and barefoot, run to the minivan. \nELLIOTT They think only you can talk her off the ledge. \nJolie looks like a deer in headlights. \nJOLIE Why me? \nELLIOTT That's what she said. \nJOLIE Really? Dang. \nELLIOTT Well she's not literally on a ledge. Figuratively. Do you know what figuratively means? \nJOLIE Duh. Come on, Dad. Just drive. \nThey hop in the van. \nEXT. STREETS OF TAKOMA PARK \nThe drive past a sign that symbolizes `Caution, Kids at Play.' \nINT. HENRIETTA'S LIVINGROOM \nJolie, still in his pajamas, walks up the steps then stops to look down them with frightened hesitation in his eyes. \nThe four parents look up - some give a few encouraging nods. \nMR. AARONSON You don't have to do this. \nJOLIE Don't worry, I know how to help Henrietta get her shit together. \nELLIOTT Jolie. \nJOLIE Dad. Come on. You know what I mean. \nINT. HENRIETTA'S BEDROOM \nTotal darkness. No TV. No overhead light. Both kids are wearing white. \nHenrietta's stands in front of a mirror, face wet and red from crying. \nJolie hugs her from behind. \nJOLIE Henrietta, your Dad showed me the test. It was bad, but if you get an A on your last exam you'll still pass. \nHe flicks on a soft warm lamp and kisses her neck. \nJOLIE (CONT'D) You just gotta learn to distribute. \nHENRIETTA You really think I don't know how to do that shit? \nJOLIE What? \n", "test2_true": "JOLIE What is it then? You can talk to me. You can tell me anything. \nHENRIETTA I wasn't invited with you guys to the Tyson fight tomorrow. The one on pay TV. I heard everyone was going and I just flipped out. I mean what's the deal? \nJOLIE What? You mean the Bowe fight? \nHENRIETTA Yeah. Bowe, Tyson, whatever. The point is the whole team's going. \nJOLIE Yeah. It's pretty much just a team thing though. \nHENRIETTA No it's not. Wendel, Arius, and Codroy are all bringing girls. \nJOLIE Oh. I didn't know that. Well, why don't I just call you when I figure out what time we're going. \nHENRIETTA Well the fight is at eight, right? \nHenrietta puts her hand on his leg. \nJOLIE Is it? \nHENRIETTA Yeah. And everyone's going to Muhammad Ali's Rotiserie Chicken at City Place. \nShe slides her hand up. \nJOLIE Oh. \nHENRIETTA Yeah. \nJOLIE Well, I don't know. You have a lot of studying. \nUneasy with her advances, Jolie plucks a Cliff Livingston basketball card off the wall. \nJOLIE Cliff Livingston. I forgot about that guy. \nHenrietta goes for a kiss. \nJOLIE Henrietta. Come on? We're not together anymore. \nHENRIETTA (SUDDENLY ANGRY) You know Spud Web only gets a roster spot because he's a circus freak. He shouldn't be there, and that's why he sells tickets. Don't you get it. He's not good, he's just a draw. Is that what you want to be, a circus freak? \nJOLIE He won the dunk contest. The guy's a beast. You're way out of your league. \nHENRIETTA The league is about making money. Jolie, the only reason you even got on varsity is because your Dad paid for the new uniforms. You never would have made it even with Francisco getting arrested. Don't you realize that? \nJOLIE No he didn't. \nHENRIETTA Yes he did. They cost over two thousand dollars. How could you not know that? I mean you made Varsity at Blair after being cut from JV last year. When have you ever seen that happen? \nThe news hits Jolie hard. \nJOLIE That's not true. Where did you hear that? \nHENRIETTA My Dad talking to your dad on the phone in the kitchen. \nJolie looks at his bandaged hand - lost in deep depressing thought. \nHenrietta leans into Jolie. Strokes his leg. Jolie, defeated, leans into her comforting arms. \nHENRIETTA I still love you, though. None of that matters to me. \nHenrietta kisses him. \nHe kisses her back. \nHenrietta's father knocks. \nHENRIETTA Dad, we're studying here! Do you mind? \nMR. AARONSON (OFF SCREEN) Sorry. I just wanted to see if you guys needed anything. \nSilence for a moment as the kids are frozen, then we hear him head down stairs. \nJolie lies down and Henrietta spoons him. They cuddle. \nEXT.

It was our first time gettng blazed and drunk. \nSoda cans, crumbs, bags of chips, and other treats and wrappers are scattered around. \nOn the television: the audience laughs wildly at a Monkey doing sign language on the Carson show. \nJOHNNY CARSON (ON TELEVISION) What's he saying now? What's he signing? \nThe guest interprets. \nGUEST (ON TELEVISION) He wants to say he loves you all, and he wishes he could hang onto these people a little longer, connect with them a little deeper, before it's all over. \nThe Carson crowd laughs wildly. \nJolie's hand slides up Christine's skirt. \nCHRISTINE (WHISPERING) Jolie! No way. Not until you know what. \nJOLIE (WHISPERING) Don't worry. \nCHRISTINE (WHISPERING) When? You've been saying you're gonna get your Dad's credit card for like a month. Time is of the essence here, duh. \nJOLIE (WHISPERING) I told you I'm on it. First thing when my parents get back. But this is the best time to do it because we dont have to wear a condom. Come on, let's go upstairs. Trust me. \nHe reaches back up her skirt. \nCHRISTINE (WHISPERING) No means no, Jolie. \nChristine pushes him away. \nHaroon comes out of the bathroom. \nHAROON (WHISPERING) Dude. I am blazed out of my mind right now, but I think someone's hiding in your shower? \nJOLIE (WHISPERING) Forreal? \nHAROON (WHISPERING) Yeah, dude.

You scared the shit out of me. \nHENRIETTA How could you? \nShe opens the curtains. \nJOLIE What? What are you doing in my basement bathroom? \nHENRIETTA I'm catching you cheating with Christine! You asshole! \nJOLIE Shhh. People are sleeping. \nHENRIETTA Don't lie to me. You think I dont know shit. She's pregnant with your baby. \nJOLIE Whao. \nHENRIETTA You think the Maple Ave. kids don't hear mad junk about the Magnet kids. \nJOLIE Henrietta, relax. \nHENRIETTA I know about all that stuff, how y'all hooked up during floor hockey intramurals under the trampoline. Everything. You think I don't have friends? I have friends! \nHenrietta starts crying. \nJOLIE Come on, I know you have friends Henrietta. \nHENRIETTA You think I'm a fool?

I better go too. This shit is too fucked up right now. \nJolie stands all alone. \nEXT. MAPLE AVE - NIGHT \nThe street sign reads Maple Ave. \nIt is lined with tall apartment buildings. Government housing. Bus stops. And cheap liquor stores and sub shops. \nJolie walks down the street. \nJOLIE (V.O.) The next day I found out Christine had the abortion on her own. She said she asked the doctor to see the fetus. \nJolie approached one of the apartment buildings. \nJOLIE (V.O., cont.) The doctor said she wasn't supposed to showed it, but did anyway. \nJolie buzzes up to an apartment. \nINT. MAPLE AVE APARTMENTS - NIGHT \nELEVATOR \nJolie rises. \nJOLIE (V.O., cont.) Christine said the dead fetus looked like a baby squirrel. Like the ones that fall out of the nest and are on the sidewalk dead with no fur yet. I guess it went well though. \nARIUS'S APARTMENT \nThe living room of a small dim one bedroom. \nSensual R&B tunes play softly from a small radio. \nJOLIE (V.O., cont.) After that Arius said not to worry about anything. That Christine would be cool, and Henrietta was just fucked up anyway. \nA gold cross hangs on the fake wood paneling with some framed family photos at a summer bar-b-que, a wedding, and the beach. \nJOLIE (V.O., cont.) He even invited me back to his place. It was the first time I had ever been to Maple ave. \nFour kids from the team are playing cards around a coffee table for one dollar bills siting mostly on a puffy floral patterned couch covered in shinny plastic. \nJOLIE (V.O., cont.) Everybody played this ghetto version of Jin Rummy called `Tunk.' \nThey all wear Addidas flip flops with socks and name brand sweatpants (Hillfiger, Nautica, Polo, etc.).

The kids have exquisite ABS, the kind you see on television. \nJOLIE Naw. I gotta see this. \nARIUS Ok. Here it goes. \nCLOSE ON: \nAn arrow clicks on the play button, but the image stays frozen: a low res picture of a bare ass black man mounted miliary style on a black girl. \nThe image moves for a brief moment.

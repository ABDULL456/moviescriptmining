CAESAR Get me a wet towel. 
His words push her to the bathroom. 
INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Stuffing a towel into the sink, she turns on the water.  She does not even look at the shower curtain. 
INT.  HALL - NIGHT 
The elevator opens and the cops step out. 
INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Caesar grabs the television remote, hits "on" and jacks the volume until it is obviously loud. 
Violet returns and he snatches the towel from her. 
INT.  HALL 
As the two cops walk down the hall, they hear the television. They look at each other, already knowing what happened. 
INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Like a maniac, Caesar wipes at any blood still visible until there is a knock on the door.  He grabs Violet by the arm. 
CAESAR If you're thinking about doing something stupid, remember I just killed Gino Marzzone.  You understand what that means? 
She nods. 
VIOLET They're just cops. 
There is another knock, much louder. 
Violet goes to the door as Caesar rips off his blood-soaked jacket and shirt. 
He drops down behind the bar Leaving the chain on, Violet opens the door.  Tbe cops smile. 
COP #1 See?  We're for real. 
VIOLET I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories. 
COP #1 You did the right thing. 
Crouching, Caesar wipes vigorously at the blood on his hands and face. 
Violet opens the door. 
Caesar crams the bloody wad under the bar sink. 
Just as the cops enter the living room, Caesar stands, looking comfortable in no shirt, with ice cubes in his hands. 
CAESAR Hey, hey, Chicago's finest. 
He plunks the ice into a glass and walks from behind the bar 
CAESAR How's it going tonight, fellas? 
COP #1 Pretty good, sir. 
Caesar turns his head. 
CAESAR Huh?  I'm sorry, I can only hear in this ear. 
Tbe cops look at each other again. 
Wiping his wet hand on his pants, Caesar shakes hands with each of them. 
CAESAR I'm Caesar and this here is my Violet. 
They smile at Violet as Caesar puts his arm around her. 
CAESAR Violet said something about gunshots? 
Violet sees the gun wedged in the back of his belt. 
COP #2 Yes, sir, a neighbor in the building called in. 
COP #1 I think we know what happened. 
COP #2 It was probably just the television. 
CAESAR The television? 
He looks at Violet. 
CAESAR Honey, why didn't you say something? Turn it off. 
Violet walks across the rug and turns off the TV. 
CAESAR Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry. 
COP #1 It's all right, sir. 
COP #2 No big deal.

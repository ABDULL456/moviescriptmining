Blood Simple 
"BLOOD SIMPLE" 
By 
Joel Coen and Ethan Coen 
LANDSCAPES 
An opening voice-over plays against dissolving Texas landscapes--broad, bare, and lifeless. 
VOICE-OVER The world is full of complainers. But the fact is, nothing comes with a guarantee. I don't care if you're the Pope of Rome, President of the United States, or even Man of the Year--something can always go wrong. And go ahead, complain, tell your problems to your neighbor, ask for help--watch him fly. Now in Russia, they got it mapped out so that everyone pulls for everyone else-- that's the theory, anyway. But what I know about is Texas... 
CUT TO 
ROAD  NIGHT 
We are rushing down a rain-swept country road, listening to the rhythmic swish of tires on wet asphalt. 
VOICE-OVER And down here... you're on your own. 
INT. CAR NIGHT 
We are looking at the backs of two people in the front seat-- a man, driving, and a woman next to him. 
Their conversation will be punctuated by the occasional glare of oncoming headlights and the roar of the car rushing by. 
The windshield wipers wave a soporific beat. The conversation is halting, awkward. 
WOMAN ...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary. 
MAN Uh-huh. 
WOMAN ...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him. 
MAN Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him. 
WOMAN Yeah... 
Pause, as an oncoming car passes. Finally: 
WOMAN ...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think? 
MAN Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you... 
Another car passes. 
MAN ...What're you gonna do in Houston? 
WOMAN I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess? 
MAN I told you. I like you. 
WOMAN See, I never knew that. 
MAN Well now you do. 
WOMAN ...Hell. 
Another pause. Another car. 
Suddenly: 
WOMAN Stop the car, Ray! 
CLOSE SHOT BRAKE 
Stamped on. 
EXT. CAR 
Low three-quarters on the car as it squeals to a halt. 
A car that has been following screeches to a halt just behind it. 
Both cars sit. 
Rain patters. 
INT. FIRST CAR 
Close on the man, from behind. 
He looks at the woman.

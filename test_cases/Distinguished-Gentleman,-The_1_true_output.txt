PRO BONO OFFICES - DAY                                   102 Celia at her desk in the somewhat ratty Pro Bono offices. CELIA Where did you go? INTERCUT CELIA AND TOMMY TOMMY Oh, a fact-finding mission, some issue conferences, a few speaking engagements, a charity event... the usual. CELIA More like the Petroleum Institute Ski Cup, the NRA Open, the -- TOMMY Hey.    Have lunch with me tomorrow. CELIA I can't -- we're having a press conference. TOMMY What is it -- the ozone layer?     No fault? Killer apples? (CONTINUED) 
THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            68. 102   CONTINUED:                                                 102 CELIA (laughing) Toy safety. Wait a minute. Tomorrow's Friday.

TOMMY So, how'd you end up hustling for Pro Bono instead of pesticides? I mean, you could have been a big- time lawyer, right? CELIA Oh, I was for a while.   It... depressed me. TOMMY At a hundred grand a year, how depressed can you get? Doesn't it depress you to lose all the time? CELIA Sometimes. Mostly it gets me angry. And the anger keeps me going. Sure, I wouldn't mind winning a few. And it's not like I'm allergic to money... TOMMY So why do you do it? She skips a stone on the water. CELIA God, it's so embarrassing to come out and say it. TOMMY Say it. CELIA Meaning. I need my life to mean something. (CONTINUED)

Celia, embarrassed, changes the subject. CELIA My question is, how'd you get named after a Memorial? TOMMY Grandma like Jefferson. Y'know, "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." It's a lot to live up to, so I specialized in the last part. CELIA And how's the pursuit going? TOMMY Fine...'til I met you. Now...the better I do, the worse I feel. They have stopped walking.    They are standing close together. They kiss. TOMMY So...when can I see you again? How about dinner Saturday night? She shakes her head. CELIA How about Sunday morning? TOMMY Brunch?

And to the man who values Gold over Goodness...the Lord allows no exemptions! REVEAL TOMMY and Celia in the front pew.

BOBBY I've had time to get over it. 
JENNY You're not from around here, are you? Where you from? 
BOBBY Oz. 
JENNY You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie. 
BOBBY You're too quick for me. 
Toby walks back into the room.  He looks at Jenny.  He looks at Bobby.  He looks at Jenny talking to Bobby.  He loses it. 
TOBY No....No....No I'm seeing but I'm not believin'...Stop the wedding.  This can't be. Hey!  What are you doing with my girl? 
Bobby says nothing, ignoring Toby. 
TOBY I axed you a question. 
JENNY Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking. 
TOBY You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. (to Bobby) Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl? 
BOBBY I wasn't doing anything. 
TOBY That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her. 
BOBBY Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs? 
JENNY Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox. 
TOBY Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ... 
BOBBY Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl. 
TOBY You expect me to believe that? 
BOBBY I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone. 
TOBY Mister, I'm calling you out. 
BOBBY What?  You want to fight?  Over her? 
Bobby looks Jenny over. 
FLO Toby, you go finish your soda and leave the man alone. 
TOBY (to Bobby) You know who I am?  Toby N. Tucker. Everyone round here call me TNT. You know why? 
BOBBY Let's see...they're not very imaginative? 
TOBY 'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt. 
BOBBY Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away? 
TOBY Not before I settle with you, chickenshit! 
BOBBY Christ, I don't believe this! 
TOBY Stand up. 
BOBBY I wasn't hitting on your girl! 
TOBY Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit. 
Bobby sits for a beat. he doesn't need a fight with Toby now with his damaged hand nor does he need to be noticed either. He sits there. 
FLO Toby, you stop it now! Can't you see he's got a hurt hand? 
TOBY Don't you never mind, Flo.  This is gonna be over real quick. 
Reluctantly Bobby rises, facing off against Toby, each clenching their fist and waiting for the other to make the first move. The tension builds.  We see it on the faces of Jenny, Flo and the regulars.  Just then the record on the juke ends and the needle scratches off.  There is the crackle of a police radio as the door to the diner opens and SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER walks in. The tension eases. Toby, mindful of the sheriff, steps closer to Bobby and whispers menacingly into his ear. 
TOBY You're lucky, Mister.  Don't think it's over.  I called you out and I'm gonna see this through.  You hear me? (to Jenny) Come on, girl.  I got half a mind to make you walk home. 
Toby takes Jenny by the arm and pulls her out of the diner. 
FLO My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose. 
SHERIFF What was that all about? 
FLO You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.

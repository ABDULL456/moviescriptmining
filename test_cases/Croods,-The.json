{"train": "THE CROODS \nWritten by \nKirk DeMicco & Chris Sanders \nSEQ. 75 - PROLOGUE \nFADE IN: \nA cave painting of the Dreamworks logo. Push past the moon to the sun. Bright. Beautiful. The sun DISSOLVES TO: \nCave paintings of a family of cavemen -- we will come to know them as The Croods. \nEEP (V.O.) With every sun comes a new day. A new beginning. A hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday. \nThe Croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for food. Scared. Fast. \nThe Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks. \nEEP (V.O.) But not for me. My name's Eep. This, is my family, the Croods. If you weren't clued in already by the animal skins and sloping foreheads - we're cavemen. Most days we spend in our cave, in the dark. Night after night, day after day. Yep. Home sweet home. When we did go out, we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world. And I struggled to survive my family. \nThe Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks. \nEEP (V.O.) We were the last ones around. There used to be neighbors. The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth. The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake. The Erfs, mosquito bite. Throgs, common cold. And, the Croods. That's us. The Croods made it... \nGrug protects his family from a GIANT BEAR OWL. \nEEP (V.O.) Because of my Dad. He was strong... and he followed the rules. \nA shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his family home. \nEEP (V.O.) ... the ones painted on the cave walls. Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad, going out at night is bad. Basically, anything fun is bad. Welcome to my world. \nThey all run back into the cave where Grug slams the rock door closed. \nSLOWLY LIGHT ON CAVE PAINTINGS COMES UP AGAIN. But this time the light casts an ominous tone. \nEEP (V.O.) But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant. \nRAPID SHOTS OF THE GREAT SPLIT CUTTING THROUGH THE LAND. HEADED TOWARDS CROOD VALLEY. \nSHOTS OF CATACLYSM. CUT FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL... \nEEP (V.O.) Because what we didn't know, was that our world was about to come to an end. And there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that. \nCAVEMAN HANDS PRESS against the rock wall. They PUSH. A BLINDING LIGHT FLOODS the screen. \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 100 - MEET THE CROODS A HUGE CAVEMAN, GRUG, RUSHES forward, screaming, growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a THREAT DISPLAY. He BLINKS in the bright morning light. He LIFTS and HURLS a large boulder. \nGRUG Raaaaar grooooOOOOoooowwwll ERF ERF Glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh! \nAs suddenly as he began, Grug stops. Panting, he waits for the echoes of his outburst to fade. \nGrug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a signal, but before any sound escapes his lips-- \nA CAVE GIRL, EEP, bursts from the cave. \nGRUG (CONT'D) You're supposed to wait for my signal Eep. Eep? \nEep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away. They pounce on Grug briefly before scampering off. Eep spreads out on an overhanging rock. She BASKS IN THE SUN. \nEEP We've been in that cave forever. \nGRUG Three days is not forever. \nEEP It is with this family. \nGRUG Eep would you come down here? You're being so dramatic. \nThe Croods sleep peacefully in their pile. Except Eep, who tosses restlessly on her LEDGE. Outside, we hear the ROARS and HOWLS of prehistoric creatures fighting. \nBut then, SILENCE. \nAnd then cutting through the primordial night is a MUSICAL SOUND. Unsettling. Unearthly. Eep creeps around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the \"door\" to peer outside, when suddenly-- \nWHOOSH! A bright light blazes through the gaps around the boulder door, bathing Eep in an OTHER-WORLDLY GLOW. She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to catch it in her hands. \nEep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to get a look at what is outside, but she can't get more than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the disappearing light. \nDesperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs. Slowly, she shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. It takes all of her strength, but she manages to move it just enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out. \nEXT. CROOD CANYON - CONTINUOUS \nEep stands outside at night for the first time ever. Her heart races. The hot night wind blows against her face and through her hair. The forbidden sensation is exhilarating. The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it will be gone in another few seconds. With one of her hands pressed tightly to the cave `door', she steels herself. \nEep LETS GO and DASHES after the light, SCRAMBLING through the SANDSTONE NARROWS, bounding from side to side. As she disappears into the darkness of the canyon, we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CANYON \nThe light ahead is growing brighter. Eep is closing on it. In her excitement, she missteps and SNAPS a stick underfoot. \nIt was barely audible. Eep instinctively FREEZES. \nA huge SHADOW of a TUSKED CREATURE is cast on the wall above her. Eep throws a rock at the shadow. \nShe POWERS STRAIGHT UP the stone wall with unexpected speed. \nThe Creature RUNS. Eep tops the wall and... \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 550 - CLOSE ENCOUNTERS \nEXT. ROCK ARCH - NIGHT \nEep steps into a small clearing. Stuck in the ground, is a TORCH. As far as Eep knows, this is the thing she was following. Eep crouches down and cautiously approaches. \nREVERSE ANGLE - Eep can feel the heat from the fire on the palms of her hands and her face. TENSE. EXCITING. \nBut camouflaged against the rock wall behind her, something MOVES. A WARTHOG CREATURE stands upright and creeps up behind her. \nEep reaches out to TOUCH the flame. The torch blows away from her. The wind has changed direction. The breeze at her back, Eep smells the Creature behind her. On her face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs the creature. She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder. It hits the torch, knocking it to the ground. Eep jumps back, GRABBING a good-sized rock - she's poised to bash the Creature's brains in. \nCREATURE Nuh! Nuh! \nThe Creature defensively raises its arms, hands in front of its face. \nGUY No! \nHands? Eep GASPS, shocked to see HUMAN HANDS attached to this monstrosity. \nThe Creature slowly puts his hands to the sides of his grotesque head, and RAISES its mask. It's a boy... he's BEAUTIFUL! This is GUY. \nEEP Augh! \nEep LEAPS BACK a few paces, DROPPING the rock on Guy's foot. \nGUY AAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHH! \nEEP Shhh! \nEep moves swiftly to silence him. She POUNCES on him and TWISTS his head sideways. Guy is SUFFOCATING. He feels around for a stick and BASHES Eep in the side of the head. \nEEP (CONT'D) Ow! \nGUY (GASPING) Air. \nEEP ...You talk. \nEEP (to the flame) Hi, fire. \nGUY (LAUGHING) It's not alive. EEP But you said it was dying. \nGUY Uh sorry,-- \nEEP It comes from where you come from? \nGUY No. I make it. \nEep BALLS her fist, GRABBING Guy tightly by the hair. \nEEP Make some for me. \nGUY Ow. Okay, it doesn't come out of me. \nEEP Make. MAKE! MAKE IT! \nEep SQUEEZES Guy like a tube of toothpaste. \nGUY You do this a lot. \nSomething CRACKS. Eep DROPS Guy - he's broken. \nEEP Are you dead? Can I have your fire if you're dead? \nBelt RUBS two flat rocks together and places them on Guy's chest like defibrillator paddles. Guy BOLTS upright. \nGUY Hey, those are cold! \nBELT Squirf! \nGUY You think? Listening shells, activate. \nBelt AND Guy use shells to LISTEN to the ground. \nGUY (CONT'D) I concur. Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately. He tries to pull her by the arm. She stays put like an anchor. \nEEP I don't even know you. \nGUY (pained, rushed) Ow. I'm Guy. \nEEP Guy? \nGUY And this is Belt. Cook, conversationalist, navigator, also keeps my pants up. \nBELT Hhiiyaa! Yaaa! \nEEP What are \"pants up?\" \nGUY Who are you? \nEEP Eep. \nGUY (cutting her off) Let me clarify, Eep. The world is ending. \nEEP What? \nGUY I'm calling it... (VERY DRAMATIC) The... End. \nBELT Da da daaaaa. \nEEP How do you know? \nGuy and Belt both do gestures to accompany the Da da daaaa. It seems very important to them. \nGUY I've seen it. It's coming this way. First, the Earth is going to shake. Then it breaks open. Everything falls in. Fire. Lava. I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but Aaaaaaaugh. Believe me, everything we're standing on, all this right here, will be gone. \nAgain with the gestures. It's a little weird to Eep. \nGUY (CONT'D) We've got to get to high ground. I know a mountain, that way-- \nEEP No. He was nice. \nGRUG What!? Excuse me? He? \nEEP Oh. Well, I thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy. \nGRAN Strange. Usually it's the reverse. \nGrug RAISES an eyebrow. \nTHUNK Eep's got a boy hog! Eep's got a boy hog! \nEep ELBOWS Thunk in the back of his head. \nEEP There was a boy. Watch, okay. I'm gonna call him. \nEep pulls out the SHELL. She BLOWS into the shell - the sound ALARMS the Croods. \nThey SMACK the shell from Eep's hand and SMASH it with their rocks. \nEep is incredulous. The dust clears - the panting Croods are satisfied the object is gone. EEP (CONT'D) What is wrong with you? \nGRUG It was dangerous. \nEEP (VERY ANGRY) It was beautiful. You want to see dangerous? Here. \nShe pelts Thunk with a rock. \nTHUNK Owww! My sniffer! \nGRUG Okay Eep, that's it. We're going back to the cave and you're going to stay in there until you're older than... her! \nEEP What!? You can't keep me inside forever! \nEep throws a tantrum of epic proportion. She SLAMS a rock on the ground. It SHATTERS to dust. \nCREAK! A strange GROAN is heard from under the ground. Then a small amount of sand falls from up above. A crack starts to splinter under their feet. \nEEP (CONT'D) He said this would happen. \nThen BOOM! The ground starts to SHAKE! \nGRUG Get to the cave! GO! \nThe Croods RACE through the CANYON NARROWS, fighting their way through falling boulders and shifting ground, heading towards the safety of their cave. \nThe Croods see the cave entrance. The canyon walls above their home start to crack. Grug sees that the falling rock will crush the cave. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Look out! Stop! \nGrug leaps and tackles his family, protecting them from the mass of rocks crashing down. The top of the canyon collapses and the Crood's cave is destroyed. Everything is engulfed by dust. The earth settles. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSEQ. 710 - CROSSING OVER \nThe dust clears a bit - the Croods are in a tight ball, covered by Grug. Grug stands, all Croods were sheltered and safe under his mighty arms. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Is everyone okay? \nUGGA Yes. Grug, the cave, it's gone. \nGrug looks back to Crood cave. It is gone. \nGRUG No. \nGrug searches the rubble for any sign that the cave might still be there. He finds one handprint, split in two. \nHe carefully fits them back together. Emotional, he lowers his head. \nAs Eep steps forward, a shaft of light filtering through the dusty veil from the wreckage crosses her face-- \nGrug BARELY catches Sandy by her leg. Grug PULLS her back like a dog on a leash. \nGRUG No, no! Come back, Sandy! \nSandy has a MOUSEPHANT in her mouth. Grug knocks it from Sandy's mouth. A gaggle of mousephants run out from the bush and scurry away. \nGRUG (CONT'D) (TENSE WHISPER) We can't be out in the open like this. We need a cave. Now step where I step. \nThey start moving. \nGRUG (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) Okay. Stay quiet. Hopefully nothing big knows we're here yet. PULL BACK - a huge colorful predator, THE MACAWNIVORE senses something. He SITS UP and STALKS OFF. \nON THE CROODS moving fitfully through the strange forest. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay. \nThe Croods cautiously move in fits and stops through the middle of this thick, pre-historic rainforest. \nTHUNK (RAMBLING) So Dad, just to be clear, are we looking for the exact same cave? (MORE) THUNK (CONT'D) If it was me, I'm just throwing this out there, if it was me choosing the cave, I would go with a smaller cave. \nAs they trek, strange creatures (BEAR PEARS, PUNCH MONKEYS) watch these foreigners. \nIn the front of the line, Grug is freaked out. But in the back Eep is taking in the wonders. They pass through a curtain of hefty hanging pears. After they pass the \"pears\" all turn to watch the Croods. \nA leaf FLUTTERS down. \nGRUG Wait. \nEep and Grug LOOK UP. \nWE PULL BACK TO REVEAL THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY PUNCH MONKEYS. \nTHUNK Dad? \nGRUG I'll take care of this. \nGrug launches into his Threat Display - \nGRUG (CONT'D) WWAAAAaaarrgghhaarrraaaarrgghhh!! \nHe flails his arms around and jumps about in front of the nearest Punch Monkey. No reaction from the Punch Monkey. Grug stops, confused... The Punch Monkey now breaks into a BROAD GRIN... Then hauls off and - THUD - Punches Grug in the face! Grug reels back, surprised - turns... Right into another Punch Monkey. It winds up and - THUD! - it hits Grug - Grug reels back - into another Monkey - THUD! - \nTHUNK Alright dad, go get `em! Oh, oh, now you got em-- Now they're really hitting you. Dad I got it, just stop running into their fists. \nGran joins in and punches Grug in the nose. \nGRAN Hah, I'm loving this. \nUGGA Grug, when you're done, we should get going. \nWide shot: Grug is being bounced back and forth like a pinball from one punch Monkey to the next. The Punch Monkeys are whooping and hollering - this is great fun! The Punch Monkeys let go of Grug and begin running away for no apparent reason. \nGrug staggers backwards into the family. \nGRUG That's right! You can't get past this! \nCHUNKY ROOOAR! \nA colorful 'bush' rears up - it's not a bush, it's a MACAWNIVORE! The Croods react, terrified \nGrug throws a rock at it. The Macawnivore catches the rock and SPRINGS! - \nCROODS GASPS \nGRUG Climb! Climb! Climb! \nGrug pushes and forces the Croods up a huge tree then as it steps away-- it is actually a giant animal. \nGRUG'S POV: A cave! GRUG (CONT'D) CAVE! GO! GO! \nThe Croods jump off the bird leg in hopes of getting to the cave. \nGUY Cavemen! Stand back! They're practically animals. See their bony, sloping foreheads? \nEEP Oh... yeah! \nGUY The huge primitive teeth? \nEEP Er... yeah... \nGUY The excessive body hair? Oh, that one's got a tail... \nEEP Uhhh... yeah... \nGuy PULLS his knife. GUY Close your eyes. I'm going to have to take their lives. \nEEP (slapping the knife away) No. It won't help. (EMBARRASSED) They're my family. \nGUY What? \nEep nods toward Thunk. \nTHUNK Ah, the sun is in his hands! \nThe Croods keep circling. \nEEP No. No. It's \"fire.\" \nUGGA Where did it come from? \nEEP (PROUDLY) He made it. \nGrug grabs him and squeezes him tight. \nGRUG Make some for me! \nEEP It doesn't come out of him. \nGRUG Make. Make it. \nPOP! Guy's ribs are cracked for the second time. \nGUY You know, you're a lot like your daughter. \nGuy falls in a heap. \nEEP Great, now he's broken. \nUGGA (O.S.) Oh, it's a baby sun. Grug turns to see Ugga, Thunk, Gran and Sandy are now sitting very close around the fire, transfixed. \nGRUG Whoa! Stay back. We don't know what it wants. \nAs Grug moves around the circle, picking up sitting Croods and placing them a safe distance from the fire, he talks to them like a kindergarten teacher: \nGRUG (CONT'D) Now we'll all sit here, and wait for the sun to come back. And tomorrow we'll find a new cave, and pretend today never happened. (MORE) GRUG (CONT'D) (looks at the fire) Isn't this fun, Eep? \nGrug looks around to see that Eep is kneeling beside Guy. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Eep, don't touch him. Goodness knows where he's been. \nSuddenly, behind Grug, Sandy ATTACKS the torch. She shakes it with her teeth, EMBERS FLY EVERYWHERE. \nTHUNK Dad, Sandy's hurting fire. \nGrug reaches down and scoops up Sandy. (NOTE: From this point, Grug will hold onto Sandy, no matter how much she struggles, kicks and bites.) \nGRUG Sandy! No! Fire is not a play thing! \nUGGA Aww, what a cute little guy. \nGRUG Hey, stay back. \nThe Croods snatch at the embers as they dance in the air around them. \nThe giant ear of corn explodes blasting Gran off frame who slams into Thunk. The speeding ear picks up Ugga, Grug. \nON EEP AND GUY \nEEP They're not so scary once you get to know them. \nEep and Guy are HIT by the speeding corn. \nGUY Who are you people? \nUGGA Oh, I'm sorry. We're the Croooooods! And you are? \nGUY Uh, Guy. \nCROODS (WAVING) Hi, Guy. \nThe speeding ear CRASHES into a lone tree, sending Guy and the Croods sprawling across the tundra. The flying ears ROCKET SKYWARD and BURST like colorful fireworks. \nTHUNK Wow! Looks like magic. And smells like food. \nPopcorn kernels RAIN DOWN upon the Croods. They are BURIED. \nGRUG Don't eat it, it's new. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSEQ. 1425 - THE GOAL IS SET \nThe Croods burst out of a mountain of popcorn. \nCROODS Still alive! \nON THE BASE OF THE POPCORN PILE \nGUY (0.S.) Come on, keep eating. \nBELT Squirf! \nGuy BURROWS out the side of the popcorn pile like a prisoner escaping Alcatraz. \nGUY gasping for air (checks to see if he's been SPOTTED) \nEEP Hey, where's Guy? \nGuy RUNS for the mountain. Eep POUNCES on Guy like a tiger. \nGUY No! \nEEP Going somewhere? \nGUY The mountain? High ground? End of the world, remember? \nEEP That already happened. It destroyed our cave. \nGUY (STRUGGLING) Noooo. That was just the beginning of the end. The end of the end is still coming. \nGRUG (as if to a dog) Eep. Drop it. \nEep SETS him down. Guy BOLTS but discovers Eep hasn't let go of his hand. Guy is YANKED backwards like he's been tied to a piling. \nEEP We can't let him go! What if we don't find a cave before sunset? What if it takes a few days? What if the birds come back? \nBEAT. \nGRAN We need his fire, dummy! \nWHOOSH! Grug grabs Guy and throws him in a log. \nGRUG Fine. You're staying with us till we find a cave. \nGrug hoists Guy in the log onto his shoulder. \nEEP (CONT'D) Stop shoving, or I will pull out your tongue! \nGRUG Do you want me to turn this family around? Do you?! Because I will turn this family around so fast! \nThe camera slowly pulls out from the family in chaos as they walk across the burned out landscape. \nX-DISS TO: The Croods are traveling across the dry land. The camera has pulled out from the family as they travel. Family chaos continues. \nTHUNK Dad, I gotta go! \nGRUG Come on, you can hold it. \nTHUNK I don't think so. \nTHUNK MOANS \nTHUNK (CONT'D) (NEAR TEARS) I gotta go really bad. \nThunk starts to HOP WITH HIS KNEES GLUED TO EACH OTHER. \nGRUG (RELINQUISHING) Go behind one of those lumpy things and make it fast. \nTHUNK Ow! Something bit me! \nGRAN (LOUD) I don't blame it. \nUGGA Maybe we should have stopped for water. \nX-DISS TO: \nA Liyote turns to watch the Croods as they travel. \nEEP Dad, can I take a turn carrying him? \nGRUG No. \nEEP How about now? \nGRUG No. \nEEP Now? GRUG No. \nEEP NOW?!?! \nGRUG NO! \nEEP (even louder) NOW?!?! \nGRUG I can do this all day long. No, no, no, and still no. \nX-DISS TO: \nOh yeah, more traveling. Now we are in the Turkeyfish hunting grounds. The camera is so far away the Croods are only a speck in the frame. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nGrug, exhausted, in the foreground with family chaos over his shoulder. \nGRAN I'm not dying on an empty stomach. \nUGGA Grug, we're all pretty tired. \nTHUNK I'm pretty dizzy, so I'm just going to lay down for a minute. \nGRUG We'll eat when we get there. \nGRAN It's taking too long! I'm grabbing a snack. \nGran jumps up and tries to grab Belt. Belt pulls a bone knife and defends himself. \nGUY No. No. No. Don't do that. He will cut you. That's not food, he's a pet. My pet. \nGUY What happened to the egg and the bird? \nTHUNK (STILL PUNCHY) You know, we lost him. But when the bird stepped on me and pushed me into the ground, the scorpion grabbed a hold of me and one thing led to another and here we are eating him. Win win. \nThe dismembered legs continue to STRUGGLE. Guy looks ill. \nGRAN Not enough. Not enough. I need more. I need more! \nGran looks hungrily at Guy. \nGUY (CONCERNED) Oh, look at that. She's not gonna eat me right? \nUGGA You're too skinny. If she was gonna eat anyone it would be-- \nTHUNK AAAAAAAAAUUGHHHHHHHH! \nTHUNK (CONT'D) Owww! She's locked her jaw! \nUGGA Mom! \nSandy gets up from the table. THUNK Someone get a stick! Get her off! \nGuy looks on, horrified. \nTHUNK (CONT'D) Oh you sick old monster! Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth! \nBelt gives Guy a \"let's get out of here\" look. Belt rolls Guy away from the family. \nGRUG Hold her still. Use a rock. Ugga would you just hit her legs. \nGuy LEAVES. Eep chases him and pins him down. \nEEP Why are you rolling away? \nGUY Owww! I just want something to eat. \nEEP You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug! \nGUY Please... I'll let you help me hunt. \nEEP Really? \nTHUNK Ahhh! They're all over me... Tell my story... \nEXT. GRASSLANDS - AFTERNOON \nGuy lays a snare in the low grass. He WALKS to the base of a rotund, spikey tree, unwinding more rope as he goes. He TIES the rope around the base of the tree. Then he hands the loose end to Eep. Belt stretches his arms WIDE. Guy STOPS jumping and points up to the top of the tree. \nEep takes the cue. She LEAPS up and grabs the leaning top of the tree. Her weight gently BENDS the tree top down to the ground. \nGUY Okay. Guy carefully SETS the trigger. \nEEP What do you call this? \nGUY A trap. \nEEP What does it do? \nGuy makes sound effects to get his point across as he describes the trap. \nGUY (explains with sounds) soft whistle Raargh, Thump thump thump, thubububububub soft whistle poom! Tadaaaaaa! \nEEP How long have you been alone? \nBelt opens his arms wide showing Guy has been alone a long, long time. \nEEP (CONT'D) ... So what do we do? \nGuy pulls out a weird miniature TURKEY FISH PUPPET. \nGUY How's your acting? \nGRUG Once upon a time there was a little tiger who lived in a cave with her family. There were a lot of rules, but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night. And the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember. \nTHUNK So easy to remember! \nGRUG I know! But, while everyone was asleep, she went out anyway. \nCROODS No! \nGRUG Yes! And no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk, with some weirdo they met, and died! The end. \nGUY Whoa! I did not see that coming. Twist ending. My stories never end like that. \nTHUNK Yes! Two stories in one night! \nThe Croods LEAVE Grug and GATHER around Guy. Guy is uncharacteristically dumbstruck. \nA BEAT - \nGUY Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's. Um, once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger. She lived in a cave with the rest of her family. Her father and mother told her, \"You may go anywhere you want but never go near the cliff, for you could fall.\" \nGRUG And die. Good story. \nThinking the story is over, the Croods begin to get up. As Guy begins talking again they settle back down. \nGUY But when no one was looking, she would go near the cliff, for the closer she came to the edge, the more she could hear, the more she could see, the more she could feel. Finally, she stood at the very edge, and she saw a light. She leaned out to touch it, and slipped. \nGRUG And she fell. \nGUY And she flew. \nCROODS GASP \nTHUNK Where did she fly? \nGUY Tomorrow. \nEEP Tomorrow? \nGUY A place with more suns in the sky than you can count. \nTHUNK It would be so bright. \nGUY A place not like today, or yesterday, a place where things are better. \nGRUG Tomorrow isn't a place, you can't see it! \nGUY Oh yes, yes it is. I've seen it. That's where I'm going. \nGrug studies Guy. Is he crazy? Eep though is entranced. Eep and Guy lock eyes. There is something growing between them. Grug and Belt see it too. Grug is not thrilled. \nGRUG Well, WE are going to shut our eyes and sleep. And when we wake up we're going to find the place that has everything we want. \nEEP Tomorrow?! GRUG A cave. \nGrug stuffs Guy neatly back inside the log. Grug CURLS UP by the fire with the LOG TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM far away from Eep. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nON GRUG'S FACE. \nGRUG snoring, tossing and turning \nMorning light kisses Grug's cheeks. He's sound asleep. PULL OUT to reveal that Guy's log is now teetering over a cliff edge - there was another subduction during the night, and half of the Croods' sleeping platform has sunk two hundred feet. Grug is still grasping Guy's log, which now hangs over the fresh abyss, and the still- asleep Guy is now SLIPPING out of one end. In the nick of time, Grug SHIFTS position, inadvertently TURNS the log, and Guy starts slipping out the OTHER end. Guy WAKES UP, looking down. \nGUY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHH. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nSEQ. 1600 - CROODS GET SHOES \nEXT. CORAL FIELDS - MORNING \nGrug grudgingly DROPS the log. \nGUY (CONT'D) Now, kick it away. \nGrug BARELY NUDGES it. \nGUY (CONT'D) Farther. \nGrug KICKS it a quarter-mile. \nGUY (CONT'D) Really?! \nGRUG Okay, smart, Guy... now what? \nGuy SMILES. \nHARD CUT TO: \nEXT. CORAL FIELDS - LATER \nEveryone is now wearing \"shoes\" -- some made of leaves, sponges and some are actually fish! \nUgga and Gran wobble on their new shoes. \nThunk is covering his eyes, too afraid to look down. Thunk looks down at his horrifying fish shoes. They blink at him. \nTHUNK Ahhhh! Good fish. \nEep is covering her eyes. \nGUY Okay. Now you can look. \nEep peers down at her new boots. \nEEP Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh! I love them! Where are my feet!? GUY They're still there! \nEEP Oh, okay. \nEep slips, and falls into Guy's arms. \nGUY Whoa. You're really (GETTING CRUSHED) ... heavy. \nEEP Really? Thank you! \nGrug walks over as the two fall to the ground. \nGRUG Hey, wait. Whoa. Whoa. WHOA!! \nGUY (SWEATING) Okay! She's up. I'm good. We're good... \nGRAN These shoes are great! Where do you get these ideas? \nGUY Ah ha. \nOn cue, Belt produces a piece of chalk. \nGuy stands Thunk against a wall. Guy stands next to him. Belt OUTLINES them. Guy excitedly gestures to the silhouettes. \nGUY (CONT'D) I'm calling it, a brain. I'm pretty sure it's where ideas come from. \nTHUNK Dad. I don't have a brain. \nGRUG We've gotten along just fine without brains till now. Cavemen don't need brains. We have these. Heeya! Haha! (balls his mighty fists) That's what I'm talking about! Ideas are for weaklings. Grug punches at the air in front of Guy making him wince. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Now, let's get to that mountain. \nUgga and Eep notice each other's shoes. \nUGGA/EEP Oh wow. I love those! \nTHUNK Good fish. Don't eat my feet. \nUgga and Gran pass unharmed through the flower grove - the colors and smells are overpoweringly vibrant. \nEep surprises Guy and Belt in their hideaway as the two of them continue to throw flowers over the edge and onto Eep's path. \nEEP You dropped these. \nGuy slips and falls onto a huge lilypad. He smiles up at Eep. \nThey share a moment before Eep shyly vanishes again. \nGrug finds himself back at the entrance of the maze. He grumbles and enters a different tunnel. \nON THE MAZE EXIT - \nGuy appears at the exit and puts his hand up to the setting sun that kisses the top of the mountain. Guy is amazed that he and Eep are both doing the same thing. He is smitten. Guy goes over to Eep. \nGuy takes her hand. GUY Come with me. \nEep and Guy turn to each other, just as Thunk emerges and tosses a rock for the Croco-Pup to fetch. \nTHUNK Here boy, catch! \nA shell note signals Ugga, Gran and Sandy's arrival. There is an obvious change in the ladies. \nTHUNK (CONT'D) Gran? \nUgga removes her hat to reveal her new look. \nEEP Mom? \nBELT (APPROVING) Raaah raaah. \nA loud shell blast interrupts. It is followed by two others. \nUGGA Grug? \nGrug lets out another blow on his horn. \nUGGA (CONT'D) I'll go get him. \nON GRUG still stuck in the maze. He holds his head in defeat, and TOSSES the shell down. \nTRUCK-IN on Grug. \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 1175 - UNDER THE STARS \nPAN UP a giant redwood tree. The Croods are gathered in a cozy crook of the tree. \nBelt mixes drinks while Gran relaxes in a hammock. Thunk is playing with his new pet. \nTHUNK Good boy. Whose my good boy? You need a name, you want a name? I'm going to call you - Douglas. Look at him. Can you do tricks? Roll over. Come on Douglas, roll over. \nDouglas ROLLS OVER, right OFF the tree. \nTHUNK (CONT'D) Good boy Douglas! \nBelt POURS a drink for Gran. Sandy takes Gran her drink as she spins over to her on her starfish shoes. \nGRAN I was in love once. He was a hunter, I was a gatherer. It was quite a scandal. We fed each other berries. We danced. (MORE) GRAN (CONT'D) Then my father smashed him with a rock and traded me to your Grandfather. \nSANDY/THUNK/EEP Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! \nBELT Ha ha ha ha. \nPAN DOWN TO TREE BASE \nUgga and Grug approach.

He's wearing a rasta-style wig made from knotted grass. The sight SHOCKS Ugga. \nGRUG Haven't seen him. \nUGGA Augh! \nON GRUG with the family standing around him. \nUGGA(CONT'D) (CONCERNED) What are you doing? \nGRUG (Playing to Eep) Yeah, Wow. Like, I was up all night cuz like all these, ideas just kept coming to me. \nGrug LIFTS his tunic, a Boa Constrictor is wrapped around his waist. \nGUY Is that a snake? \nGRUG Belt! New and improved! It's even self- tightening. Ow! \nThe constrictor SQUEEZES Grug till he turns blue. Grug SMACKS it and it relaxes a little. \nUGGA What is that on your head? \nGRAN It's called desperation. \nGrug strokes his weird, fake rasta-hair. \nGRUG (swings his long hair around) I call it a \"rug.\" Rhymes with Grug. And this one. I call it a \"ride.\" Rhymes with Grug. \nGrug regards a boulder as if it's a Ferrari. \nGUY That, doesn't-- \nGRUG It's gonna get us places faster than shoes. \nGrug climbs on top of the rock, facing the wrong way. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Yeah. Try to keep up. \nHe LEANS FORWARD. The \"car\" ROLLS downhill and SMASHES through a redwood, TOPPLING it. \nTHUNK I wish I had a ride. \nON THUNK \nHis face SLATHERED with reddish mud. \nGRUG Painting is a thing of the past. I call this, a \"snap-shot.\" \nThousands of birds fly overhead darkening the sky. \nThe shell boat hits the shore. The Croods step out onto land. \nAn explosion goes off on a nearby mountain. A PLUME of magma BURSTS from the water in the distance. \nGrug looks around for shelter and spots a cave. \nGRUG Cave! Everyone inside. Come on! Hurry up, let's go. Go, go. \nThe Croods don't want to move. \nEEP No. \nUGGA (GENTLY) No more caves, Grug. \nGRUG What? \nGRAN We're gonna jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy. \nGRUG Wait, so you're all going to do this? \nSilence from the Croods answers his question. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Thunk? \nTHUNK Sorry, dad. \nThunk joins the others. It's the last straw. \nEEP You have to stop worrying for all of us. GRUG It's my job to worry. It's my job to follow the rules. \nEEP The rules don't work out here. \nGRUG They kept us alive. \nEEP That wasn't living, that was just, not dying. There's a difference. \nGRUG Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me. \nUgga doesn't move. \nEEP We would be dead if we listened you. \nGrug is STUNNED. \nEEP (CONT'D) We have to follow Guy now. \nGrug slowly turns around to face Guy. He is smoldering. \nGRUG Guy? \nUGGA Guy, run. \nGrug lunges toward Guy, SCREAMING. \nGRUG AAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! \nGrug ATTACKS Guy - they fall down an embankment. \nCUT TO: \nSEQ. 2100 - TAR PIT \nGrug CHASES Guy across a TREMBLING landscape. \nGUY This is pointless. We're running out of time. Everything is collapsing. You're being irrational and counterproductive. \nGRUG Big words anger me. Keep talking. \nGUY Countermeasures. \nSEQ. 2250 - GRUG & GUY ESCAPE \nWe are tracking with the MACAWNIVORE. Suddenly, the big cat stops. His eyebrows raise. \nMACAWNIVORE'S POV - a FEMALE MACAWNIVORE PUPPET. \nBELT TA-DAAAAA \nGRUG Wow. \nGUY Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best with what he has. Let's go. \nGrug and Guy are holding bones connected to the puppet. Belt SIGNALS to Guy. \nGUY (CONT'D) There he is. Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity. Move me. \nBelt makes music, which grabs the Macawnivore's attention. \nGUY (CONT'D) Okay he sees us! Belt plays a little melodramatic tune. \nGrug halfheartedly moves the bones he's holding. \nGUY (CONT'D) That's our cue. Now work it! \nThe puppet starts shaking its tail. \nGUY (CONT'D) He's not coming over. I don't think our puppet looks scared enough. \nGRUG Scared? I'll show you scared. Hand me those acting sticks! \nGrug shakes the puppet and makes a frightening sound of terror. \nSuddenly, the Macawnivore leaps forward and jumps on the puppet. He grabs it and pulls it up out of the tar, bringing Grug and Guy along with it. \nGrug and Guy hang on to the bones of the puppet frame. \nThe Macawnivore shakes the puppet, pulling it out of the tar along with Grug and Guy. \nGUY Hold on! \nThe puppet breaks apart, the Macawnivcore turns to Grug and Guy. He is not pleased. \nBELT Da da daaaaaa... \nThe Macawnivore dashes towards the pair. They try to run from him. The Macawnivore's paws slip slowly backwards into the nearby tar--he's stuck. The tar snaps him back and throws him far from Grug and Guy. \nBelt blows a whistle signalling a field goal! \nGRUG Yes. You did it! \nGrug PATS Guy on the back. Grug realizes his hand is stuck to Guy's back. \nThe Croods come running to help them. UGGA Grug. \nTHUNK Dad! \nGrug and Guy TURN to see the rest of the Croods. Grug waves to the family with Guy stuck to his hand. \nGUY Hey, we're okay! \nThe family stops to take this in. \nGUY (CONT'D) Yeah, we're okay. \nThe ground shakes violently. Meteors stream across the sky. \nGUY (CONT'D) Grug. Your call. \nGrug knows his answer. \nGRUG Take us to Tomorrow. \nGUY Heh. That's a joke, right? \nGRUG What's a joke? \nGrug's comment freaks Guy out. ANOTHER ANGLE shows Grug with a twinkle in his eye. \nBelt puts on his helmet for safety. With a titanic effort, he HURLS Guy in to the void. \nThe Croods wait an eternity. Then - a HORN SOUNDS. \nUGGA He made it... He made it... \nGRUG Okay, Thunk. Your turn. \nTHUNK You're not coming, are you? \nGRUG When you make it, so will I. \nGrug HURLS Thunk. \nUgga KISSES Grug. She whispers in his ear. \nUGGA You did good. \nSANDY Daddy. \nGrug wipes a tear from Ugga's eye. Then lifts her above his head. He HURLS her across. \nGRUG Gran. \nGran is next in line. \nGRAN No mush, just throw me. \nGrug LIFTS her above his head. \nGRAN (CONT'D) Wait. You surprised me today. Lunkhead. \nGrug SMILES and throws her next. \nGRAN (CONT'D) (landing on the other side) Still alive!!! \nAnother TREMBLER. MORE cliff FALLS away. Now the distance is even greater. \nEep is next in line. \nGRUG Time to go. \nEEP No. I have too much to say to you. I need to fix everything and I don't have time. \nGRUG I can fix it. \nGrug embraces Eep. \nEEP This works good. What do you call it? \nGRUG I was thinking of calling it a Hug. (clears his throat) (MORE) GRUG (CONT'D) Because it rhymes with Grug. But you can change it if you want. \nEEP No. I like a \"Hug.\" \nA BEAT. \nGRUG I love you. \nEep takes in the full effect of her dad's words. \nEEP I... \nThe ground begins to shake and break apart around them. \nEEP (CONT'D) Dad, I'm scared. \nAs the cage flies, above the fiery landscape, Grug sees Douglas, sitting forlornly with the shell still in his mouth. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Douglas? \nGrug doesn't even debate it, he runs back for the little monstrosity. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Hey, I know that guy. \nGrug JUMPS out of the cage and rushes over to grab the gerbils. Then Grug notices a familiar Liyote hiding under a nearby rock. He GRABS the Liyote. Grug sees the TRIP-GERBILS stranded as well. Grug TWIRLS the Trip- Gerbils around his neck like a scarf. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Get up! \nA ROAR BUILDS behind Grug - the pyroclastic flow is SPEEDING closer. \nGrug CATCHES UP to the lumbering blimp-cage. He PUSHES it to go faster. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Hold on. \nThe pyroclastic cloud BLASTS up the narrow passage. Finally, with Grug's strength, the cage CLEARS the edge of the cliff. \nThe CLOUD HITS them all, SWALLOWING the Cage like a speck. \nCUT TO: \nSQ 3000 REUNITED - 05.16.2012 \nEXT. \"TOMORROW\" \nON EEP \nStanding at the edge of the cliff alone, BLOWING her shell horn.

Eep continues to blow her shell horn. Eep and Gran share a moment. Eep breaks into tears. Gran looks at her shell horn and BLOWS it loudly. Eep is happily surprised. \nThe whole family, even Guy, steps up next to Eep and begins BLOWING their shell horns. \nIt's clear from Eep's expression she has no intention of budging. \nEEP I never got to tell him. \nUgga appeals to Eep. \nUGGA Eep, if your Dad were here, he would tell YOU TO-- \nGRUG (O.S.) GET OUT OF THE WAY!!! \nTHUNK Wow, you sound just like him. \nUgga looks up. Guy LOOKS UP. Everyone looks up! \nGRUG (O.S.) GET OUT OF THE WAY!!! \nSANDY Daddy! EEP He did it! \nGUY He's riding the Sun... but not very well. Everybody out of the way! \nGrug CRASHES near the family. They run to meet him. \nTHUNK Dad! \nUGGA Grug! \nGRUG Ahhh! Where's the danger? Who blew their shell? \nBut all Grug sees is his astonished family staring back at him. \n", "test1_input": "EEP Heads. \nGran FACE-PLANTS, her head buried in the sand.

Come on Thunk. \nThunk BREAKS COVER. He dashes into the open, SNATCHES the egg. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Hah! Way to go. Take it to the cave! \nThunk PASSES Grug and makes a bee-line for Crood Canyon. \nA Gerf bird smashes Thunk and steals the egg back. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Oooh! \nGRUG (CONT'D) Release the baby. \nEep and Sandy MOVE IN on the bird. Sandy NIPS at its heels while UGGA CLIMBS up onto its head. She PULLS the egg from its beak. \nDown range, TRIP GERBILS SURFACE. They STRETCH their shared tail across the Ramu's path like an arresting cable on a carrier. \nUgga RISES to THROW the egg to Grug - the gerbils WRAP their tail around the Ramu like a bola. The Ramu GOES DOWN hard. Ugga and the egg ROLL forward. The Trip Gerbils SNATCH up the egg and make off with it. \nUGGA Get um Mom! Do it for the Croods! \nGran's cane HOOKS the gerbils in the middle of their tail and WHIPS them up and over her shoulder. \nON GRAN \nDRIBBLING the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey player.

Eep, avenge me. \nON EEP \nCrouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights. Eep LAUNCHES. \nEep runs after the Liyote with the egg, cutting him off in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg into the air. Eep leaps into the air taking back the egg. \nEEP Thanks! \nA bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her. She loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug. \nGRUG Eep! \nEEP Heads Up! \nGrug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small cave. Thunk following close behind accidentally trips over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the ground and fumbling the egg once again. \nThunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks. The family members meet up as they begin their long run back to the cave. \nAn entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head back to their cave. \nThe Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the chase. \nGrug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each family member onto the Girelephant's back. \nGrug dodges the BearOwl's attack and uses him as a launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant. \nThunk is happy to see Dad is safe. \nTHUNK Oh hey Dad, can we eat now? \n", "test1_true": "The entrance to Crood canyon appears on the horizon. \nEep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as Grug takes over the other.

The Girelephant crashes into the entrance of the canyon, sending the Croods flying in. They all tumble. Grug makes an extraordinary football catch. He holds tight to the meal as he slams into a rock. Grug holds up the egg. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Who's hungry? \nTHUNK Alright! Good one, dad! \nGRUG Here you go, Thunk. Drink up. \nGrug tosses the egg to Thunk, Thunk fumbles it and it cracks open. \nTHUNK Sorry, dad. \nUGGA Looks like fast food tonight! \nThe family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each Crood gets a taste. Thunk is the last Crood to get a mouthful, he hands it over to Grug-- the egg is empty. \nGRUG That's alright. I ate last week. \nA SHADOW TOUCHES Grug's feet.

And one day, while she was in a tree, the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top. \nTHUNK Wha? \nGRUG And no sooner than she climbed to the top, she saw something new and died. \nGrug SWATS the painting. \nTHUNK Just like that? \nGRUG Yes!

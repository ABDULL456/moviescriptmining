But when the bird stepped on me and pushed me into the ground, the scorpion grabbed a hold of me and one thing led to another and here we are eating him. Win win. \nThe dismembered legs continue to STRUGGLE. Guy looks ill. \nGRAN Not enough. Not enough. I need more. I need more! \nGran looks hungrily at Guy. \nGUY (CONCERNED) Oh, look at that. She's not gonna eat me right? \nUGGA You're too skinny. If she was gonna eat anyone it would be-- \nTHUNK AAAAAAAAAUUGHHHHHHHH! \nTHUNK (CONT'D) Owww! She's locked her jaw! \nUGGA Mom! \nSandy gets up from the table. THUNK Someone get a stick! Get her off! \nGuy looks on, horrified. \nTHUNK (CONT'D) Oh you sick old monster! Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth! \nBelt gives Guy a \"let's get out of here\" look. Belt rolls Guy away from the family. \nGRUG Hold her still. Use a rock. Ugga would you just hit her legs. \nGuy LEAVES. Eep chases him and pins him down. \nEEP Why are you rolling away? \nGUY Owww! I just want something to eat. \nEEP You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug! \nGUY Please... I'll let you help me hunt. \nEEP Really? \nTHUNK Ahhh! They're all over me... Tell my story... \nEXT. GRASSLANDS - AFTERNOON \nGuy lays a snare in the low grass. He WALKS to the base of a rotund, spikey tree, unwinding more rope as he goes. He TIES the rope around the base of the tree. Then he hands the loose end to Eep. Belt stretches his arms WIDE. Guy STOPS jumping and points up to the top of the tree. \nEep takes the cue. She LEAPS up and grabs the leaning top of the tree. Her weight gently BENDS the tree top down to the ground. \nGUY Okay. Guy carefully SETS the trigger. \nEEP What do you call this? \nGUY A trap. \nEEP What does it do? \nGuy makes sound effects to get his point across as he describes the trap. \nGUY (explains with sounds) soft whistle Raargh, Thump thump thump, thubububububub soft whistle poom! Tadaaaaaa! \nEEP How long have you been alone? \nBelt opens his arms wide showing Guy has been alone a long, long time. \nEEP (CONT'D) ... So what do we do? \nGuy pulls out a weird miniature TURKEY FISH PUPPET. \nGUY How's your acting? \n", "test1_true": "ON GUY AND EEP working the puppet.

Oh, that one's mine. \nIn their struggle to UNTANGLE themselves, Eep and Guy inadvertently insult the Turkey Fish. It CHARGES. Eep and Guy don't notice. \nThe Turkey Fish MISSES the snare, LEAPS the rock and SNATCHES the fake bird off of Guy's head, THRASHING it. \nEEP (CONT'D) Uh... It didn't step in your trap-y, thing. \nGUY Yeah, I noticed. \nEep BOLDLY STANDS in front of the bird. The Turkey Fish grabs Guy and tosses him high across the open field. He goes flying through the air, screaming. \nON GRUG - hearing the commotion. Guy lands back in the log. \nGRUG Where's Eep? \nEep is in full parkour as she runs from the Turkeyfish. \nGUY She's awesome. \nGrug STEPS FORWARD. He's going to SPRING the trap. \nGRUG Eep! \nEEP Dad, no! \nShe LEAPS the snare, PUSHING Grug DOWN. \nThe Turkey Fish HITS the trigger. The snare TRIPS. The bird BITES at the cavemen, but comes up short. The Turkey Fish WHOOSHES BACKWARDS into the air. He FLIES a couple hundred feet up... \n... and CRASHES down in a cloud of feathers. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSEQ. 900 - BBQ/CAPTIVATING CAPTIVE \nEXT. BARBECUE \nON THE TURKEY ROASTING over an open fire. It looks golden and juicy. Grug is agitated. The Croods are devouring the Turkey Fish. \nTHUNK It's an avalanche of flavor. \nTHE CROODS are eating like wild animals. They practically MAUL each other for scraps. HOWLS and SNARLING fill the night air. Guy is amazed and shocked at how the Croods are wolfing it down. \nGuy sits to the side, his ankle roped to a heavy rock. Guy and Belt share a concerned LOOK as they politely eat their meal. Eep comes over and sits next to Guy. \nGUY (TO BELT) Looks like we won't be having any leftovers. \nEEP What are \"left-overs?\" \nGUY (CONFUSED) You know, when you have so much food to eat you have some, left over. \nEEP We never have that much food. \nGrug is struck by Eep's words. Ugga sees Grug is hurt. Guy and Belt are struck by this as well. \nUGGA Grug, how about a story? \nGRUG That's a good idea. How about a story huh? \nTHUNK Yeah a story, tell us a story! \nCroods gather around Grug. \n", "test1_id": 198, "test2_input": "GRUG Once upon a time there was a little tiger who lived in a cave with her family. There were a lot of rules, but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night. And the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember. \nTHUNK So easy to remember! \nGRUG I know! But, while everyone was asleep, she went out anyway. \nCROODS No! \nGRUG Yes! And no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk, with some weirdo they met, and died! The end. \nGUY Whoa! I did not see that coming. Twist ending. My stories never end like that. \nTHUNK Yes! Two stories in one night! \nThe Croods LEAVE Grug and GATHER around Guy. Guy is uncharacteristically dumbstruck. \nA BEAT - \nGUY Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's. Um, once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger. She lived in a cave with the rest of her family. Her father and mother told her, \"You may go anywhere you want but never go near the cliff, for you could fall.\" \nGRUG And die. Good story. \nThinking the story is over, the Croods begin to get up. As Guy begins talking again they settle back down. \nGUY But when no one was looking, she would go near the cliff, for the closer she came to the edge, the more she could hear, the more she could see, the more she could feel. Finally, she stood at the very edge, and she saw a light. She leaned out to touch it, and slipped. \nGRUG And she fell. \nGUY And she flew. \nCROODS GASP \nTHUNK Where did she fly? \nGUY Tomorrow. \nEEP Tomorrow? \nGUY A place with more suns in the sky than you can count. \nTHUNK It would be so bright. \nGUY A place not like today, or yesterday, a place where things are better. \nGRUG Tomorrow isn't a place, you can't see it! \nGUY Oh yes, yes it is. I've seen it. That's where I'm going. \nGrug studies Guy. Is he crazy? Eep though is entranced. Eep and Guy lock eyes. There is something growing between them. Grug and Belt see it too. Grug is not thrilled. \nGRUG Well, WE are going to shut our eyes and sleep. And when we wake up we're going to find the place that has everything we want. \nEEP Tomorrow?! GRUG A cave. \nGrug stuffs Guy neatly back inside the log. Grug CURLS UP by the fire with the LOG TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM far away from Eep. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nON GRUG'S FACE. \nGRUG snoring, tossing and turning \nMorning light kisses Grug's cheeks. He's sound asleep. PULL OUT to reveal that Guy's log is now teetering over a cliff edge - there was another subduction during the night, and half of the Croods' sleeping platform has sunk two hundred feet. Grug is still grasping Guy's log, which now hangs over the fresh abyss, and the still- asleep Guy is now SLIPPING out of one end. In the nick of time, Grug SHIFTS position, inadvertently TURNS the log, and Guy starts slipping out the OTHER end. Guy WAKES UP, looking down. \nGUY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHH. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nSEQ. 1600 - CROODS GET SHOES \nEXT. CORAL FIELDS - MORNING \n", "test2_true": "THE LOG \nEep walks alongside Guy, who is still being carried by Grug in the log. \nGUY That was too close. It almost caught us. \nGRUG I was watching. We were fine. \nGUY We've got to move faster. Do you people have any other speed aside from \"wander?\" I'll take a shamble at this point. \nEEP Hey, do you have a minute? How did the tiger fly? \nGUY I only share when I'm outside the log. I'm funny that way. \nEEP (WINKING) Leave this to me. \nEep FALLS BACK behind Thunk, getting him between she and her dad. \nEEP (CONT'D) Hey Thunk, you have a spider on your face. \nEep SMASHES Thunk in the face, KNOCKING him into Grug, sending Guy and the log FLYING. Grug shoots Eep an annoyed look. \nEEP (CONT'D) (SHRUGGING) Oops. \nGrug sees Guy has ROLLED away. \nGRUG He's loose! \nGrug goes to retrieve Guy, and STEPS on something sharp. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Aaaaahhhhhh! Do not step on those weird, pointy rocks! \nTHUNK You mean these rocks? Ahh owww! Do not step on these rocks! \nThunk steps on the coral - it CRUNCHES under his feet. \nGRAN Step aside, girls! \nGran steps out, and then SCREAMS. GRUG Hello? Nobody's listening! No one is listening.

Arraugh! \nGrug cringes and bellows with every step. Guy still locked inside the log, hops away as fast as he can. Grug leaps out and grabs the log only to loosen it as Guy jumps to a coral patch below. \nGUY Ow, ow, ow. \nGuy now free runs and hides behind a giant shell. He looks back at the Croods as they try in vain to cross the field and feels pity for Eep. \nTHUNK Ow! Jumping doesn't help, I mean, just briefly, but it doesn't get better! Ow! Do not walk on your hands, the hands do not help at all. \nGuy looks back at the stranded Croods. Then he looks again to the tall mountain. Belt sees that Guy is having a hard time leaving the Croods. He needs to make a choice. Belt makes it for him. \nBELT Eeccoomme on! \nBelt walks Guy back to the Croods \nHARD CUT TO: \nGUY STANDS AT THE EDGE OF THE CORAL, ONLY A FEW FEET FROM GRUG AND THE CROODS.

And this one. I call it a \"ride.\" Rhymes with Grug. \nGrug regards a boulder as if it's a Ferrari. \nGUY That, doesn't-- \nGRUG It's gonna get us places faster than shoes. \nGrug climbs on top of the rock, facing the wrong way. \nGRUG (CONT'D) Yeah.

ALEJANDRO They see it all, and must avoid the traps set everywhere for them. We look for one who is older... one who has had enough. 
Bob walks up. 
BOB You done with these behind you? 
MATT All yours. 
The Agents begin yelling and marching the smuggler group out. Alejandro turns to Bob. 
ALEJANDRO Break them into groups of four, Let them spread out, each group as far from the other as possible. 
Bob huddles his agents and begins explaining as Matt and Alejandro walk off. 
We see Reggie, observing from the entrance. He's had enough `not knowing', walks to Macy. 
REGGIE What are we doing here?(Looks her over) What were you doing in Mexico?? 
MACY I'm with you, alright. I don't have answers. 
REGGIE Well, let's get some then. 
She looks at him. 
MACY You think I haven't asked these questions. Think you can do better? MATT. Can we talk to you for a minute? 
He starts walking toward them. They head for the open warehouse door. 
EXT IMMIGRATION WAREHOUSE     CONT. 
Macy and Reggie stop in the center of the parking lot. Matt catches up to them. 
MATT This feels very serious. 
REGGIE What are we looking for? There's in the dark and then there's the way you're treating us. I want to know the objective, or I walk. Period. 
MATT Then go. I didn't ask you to be a part of this. She did. 
MACY I walk too. 
Reggie stares at Matt, who casually smiles, pacifying the children. 
MATT What would you like to know? 
REGGIE Everything. 
MATT Guillermo told us about a tunnel east of Nogales, near Sasabe. So now, we're trying to find what areas near there migrants avoid. Because that's where the tunnel will be. Better? 
REGGIE Guillermo is...? 
Matt laughs. 
MATT I'm going back in. 
He turns. 
MACY He TOLD you where a drug tunnel is... Just... Told you. 
MATT Guillermo didn't have any other options. We send him back across the border and he's a dead man. Had to give us something. 
He just smiles... 
MACY Bullshit. 
REGGIE Look man, we have a boss, and you ain't him. Be straight. What are you doing? 
MATT We're going to make enough noise that Manuel Diaz is called back to Mexico to see HIS boss. 
REGGIE And then? 
MATT And then we know where his boss is. 
ALEJANDRO (O.S.) Fausto Alarcon, Manuel's cousin... Manuel's boss... He is an executioner... 
Alejandro stands beside them, but looks out over the black desert. 
ALEJANDRO (CONT'D) When people die in my country, it is with his hand or his blessing. To find him would be like... discovering a vaccine. Manuel will lead us to him. 
His kind, hollow eyes meet Reggie's. Alejandro manufactures a smile.

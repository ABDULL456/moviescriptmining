ALI Shit... But what's the problem if I eat here? Anna stands up. 
ANNA They had cameras in the storeroom... They filmed us when we took the expired food. They fired us. Ali's head spins. 
ANNA You had your sister fired. How does it feel? How much did you get for that? You get paid per person or a flat rate? Nothing to say? I take you in, I take care of your son and you have nothing to say? 
ALI I couldn't know... 
ANNA You couldn't know? You couldn't know what? That you were screwing us out of jobs? That you were hurting people? Ali tries to find something to say, but his sister's hand delivers a resounding slap. He takes it like a man. A moment passes. Ali is red from the slap, red with shameâ¦ until he suddenly straightens up and knocks over the table. 
RICHARD Calm down. Calm down, I said! Ali looks back. He sees Richard's grim face at the other end of a hunting rifle. 
RICHARD Take your stuff and get out of here. We don't want to see you around here anymore. 
A sudden noise draws their attention: Sam is watching from the top of the stairs. 
ANNA Go to your room. Go upstairs immediately. 
129. INT. ANNA'S HOUSE - BASEMENT. DAY 
An SMS arrives from Stephanie: âAlmost there. I miss you.â Ali is lying on his mattress. He puts down the phone. He hears Anna and Richard's voices upstairs. He sits up and begins to stuff things into a bag. A new message arrives: âI'm home. Oper?â Ali hesitates, then turns off his phone and clicks his bag closed. 
130. INT. ANNA'S HOUSE - SAM'S ROOM. EVENING 
Night has fallen. Sam's nose is stuck to his bedroom window. He sees his aunt sitting at the plastic table in the garden downstairs with her face in her hands. A door slams. Sam rushes to the bathroom window. He sees his father stomp down the street, never once looking back. Sam remains glued to the window pane. Ali's silhouette moves through the halo of a streetlight before again disappearing into the dark. Sam watches him for as far as he can. Fade to black. 
131. INT/ EXT. BASEMENT. DAY 
In the half-light of the basement, a rectangle of light has formed where the door opens onto the street. Stephanie looks over Ali's mess: his magazines, body building equipment, dirty T-shirts, track suits hanging over a trestle... Anna is standing against the light at the door and, a bit farther off, Sam is sitting on the stairs watching them. 
ANNA In his message he said he was in Strasbourg. No news since. I don't know what he's doing 
there, or even if he's still there. Has he called you? She shakes her head "no". 
ANNA Did you try the gym? 
STEPHANIE Yeah. They don't know. 
ANNA If I had an address or a number, I'd give it to you... Even if I think it's dumb. Do you believe me? 
STEPHANIE Yes. 
ANNA After what he did to me... Sam sees Stephanie join Anna near the door. She's about to leave. 
ANNA He abandoned his kid. He doesn't give a fuck about anything. All he ever cared about was himself. He's totally selfish. Sam watches the two women swallowed up by the light. 
STEPHANIE (OFF) You don't know him. 
ANNA (OFF) Me? What did you expect with him? 
STEPHANIE (OFF) I don't know. Not this. Fade to black. Black. 
132. EXT. ALSATIAN COUNTRYSIDE. MORNING 
A frosty landscape with trees that look like they've been engraved in ink... A group of twelve joggers in blue track suits run across a landscape of gray sky and snow. Some shadowbox while running. Ali is wearing a wool cap pulled down around his ears. He runs alongside Foued. 
133. INT. HOLIDAY VILLAGE. GYM. DAY 
A ring has been set up in the middle of the gym. A few guys have gathered round to watch Ali rhythmically pound on his trainer's bear-like paws. Leonardini sets the pace.

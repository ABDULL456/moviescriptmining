The Battle of Algiers 
The Battle of Algiers 
1	VILLA HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. NIGHT. 
Inside a three-story villa, just built, with whitewashed walls. An elevator shaft is empty, the large cables dangle. 
On every landing two apartments. The front doors are wide open. Whitewash on the floor of the halls, swirls of whitewash on the windowpanes, naked light bulbs hung from electric wires. The rooms contain hardly any furnishings. 
The kitchens are still without sinks and stoves. 
An agitated bustle, a rhythm of efficiency. Paratroopers go up and down the stairs, pass along the halls, enter and leave the rooms. 
The sounds in the background are indecipherable. 
SHOUTED ORDERS, CRIES, HOWLS. 
SHOUTS, HALF-SPOKEN REMARKS, LAUGHS. 
SOMEWHERE A GRAMOPHONE IS PLAYING AT FULL BLAST. 
The scene is tense. No pauses. 
When the paras are tired, they move to another room. 
They sit down, stretch out on the floor, drink coffee or beer, and smoke cigarettes while awaiting the next shift. Suddenly, the rhythm of this routine, the timing of these images is upset. A para rushes down the stairs, and asks cheerfully while running: 
MARC The colonel. Where's the colonel? 
PARAS Why? What's happening? 
MARC We know where Ali la Pointe is. One of them "spoke" ... 
His voice echoes through the corridors, on the landings, from one floor to another. The excitement is contagious. Many crowd around the door of the kitchen. 
The Algerian who has "spoken" is there. He is young with a thin face and feverish eyes. The paras are all around him: they help him stand up, dry him, clean his face with a rag, give him some coffee in a thermos cover. They are full of attention, sincerely concerned. One of them tries to push away the others. 
PARA C'mon, let him breathe! 
Meanwhile others who are arriving ask if it is true. 
OTHER PARAS So he spoke? Does he really know where Ali is? 
MARC It seems so. We'll go see. Give him a little coffee. 
Marc is tall and husky, his eyes young and cheerful. One of the others asks him with a shade of admiration: 
PARA Hey Marc, you made him talk? 
MARC (smiling) Sure. 
He then begins to smoke again, and moves aside to rest a bit. The Algerian is trying to drink, but his hands are trembling. Someone helps him and holds still the cover of the thermos, drawing it to his mouth: 
LAGLOY C'mon Sadek ... Drink, you'll feel better. 
The Algerian drinks, but his stomach can't take it, causing him to double over and vomit again. 
Colonel Mathieu enters, elegant and graceful. 
MATHIEU (smiling) At ease. Is it true? 
MARC I think so. Rue des Abderames three ... 
The colonel turns to the para, who had gone to call him, and who is holding a pair of camouflage fatigues in his hands. 
MATHIEU Dress him. 
Then he goes near the Algerian, lifts his chin, inspects him for a moment with curiosity. 
MATHIEU Chin up, it's all over. Nothing can happen to you now, you'll see. Can you stand up? 
The Algerian nods yes. The colonel turns to the paras who are holding him up. 
MATHIEU Let him go. 
He takes the camouflage fatigues and hands them to the Algerian. 
MATHIEU Here, put them on. 
The Algerian mechanically takes the fatigues, but he doesn't understand. The colonel explains to him:

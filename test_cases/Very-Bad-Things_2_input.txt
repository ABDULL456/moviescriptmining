FISHER (V.O.) I'm mad at you. 
LIZ Go have fun. Not too much. 
FISHER (V.O.) I'll see you tomorrow... 
CASINO 
Fisher hangs up, a "crazy about the girl" smile on his face. 
INT. FISHER'S SPLIT-LEVEL HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 
The MUSIC is LOUD. The boys are super drunk in the swank bachelor party suite. 
MOORE stagger-dances on a table. 
BOYD AND MICHAEL stand at the wet-bar. 
BOYD I don't hate women. 
MICHAEL You hate women. 
BOYD False. 
MICHAEL True. 
BOYD Not true. 
MICHAEL You have a King fantasy. 
BOYD I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night. 
MICHAEL And what happens when you can't? 
BOYD (swigs whiskey; looks up) New king. 
EXT. BALCONY 
Adam and Fisher. 
ADAM No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me... He said, Adam, he said... He told me and I heard him... he said... (struggles to remember) Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake. 
FISHER Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father. 
ADAM Are you solid with that? 
FISHER No. I think it's fucked. 
ADAM Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now... You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here? 
MICHAEL AND BOYD AT THE BAR 
speed hitting cocaine. 
BOYD If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see? 
MICHAEL Israel doesn't have a King. 
BOYD Then what do they have? 
MICHAEL They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something. 
BOYD I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot. 
MICHAEL What's your point? 
BOYD Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time... right? Am I right? 
MICHAEL The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies. 
BOYD There's my point exactly. 
MICHAEL What? What's your point? 
BOYD Take Mexico. 
MICHAEL What? 
BOYD Look up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico. 
ANGLE ON 
MOORE crazed with the rhythm of the "Chemical Brothers," jumps up and down on the table.

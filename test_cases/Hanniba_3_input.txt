BRIGHAM LEADS STARLING INTO THE HOUSE. 
HE CLOSES THE DOOR, AND TAKES HER TO THE SOFA. 
SHE SITS, AND PICKS UP A PHOTOGRAPH IN AN EASELFRAME FROM THE COFFEETABLE. 
STARLING (cont'd) Hey, now, what was I afraid of... I'm shooting at shadows... 
BRIGHAM Is that what you're afraid of...? 
ANGLE INS ON THE PHOTOGRAPH, SHOWS A TALL HANDSOME MAN IN WESTERN HAT, WEARING A BADGE, HIS HAND ON THE SHOULDER OF A YOUNG BLONDE GIRL. 
ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE PUTS THE PHOTO DOWN. 
STARLING Then you tell me, then. 
BRIGHAM You want me to solve all your problems tonight...? 
STARLING I feel... (SHE STARTS TO LAUGH) I feel they're Out to Get Me... 
BRIGHAM And who is "they?" 
STARLING ...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... (PAUSE) 
BRIGHAM ...the whole world's out to get you... 
STARLING How crazy is that. 
BRIGHAM Well, you wanna shoot back, it give you a big target... 
STARLING (SLEEPILY) How crazy is that.... 
ANGLE, INS. ON THE LECHTER FILE, AND THE PHOTO OF HANNIBAL LECHTER. 
WE SEE BRIGHAM PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE NEXT TO THE PHOTO. HOLD, LIGHTS GO OFF. 
BEAT.  STARLING'S HAND COMES INTO THE FRAME, SWEEPS THE LECHTER PHOTO AND FILE ONTO THE FLOOR, AND REPLACES IT WITH THE PHOTO OF THE WESTERN GARBED MAN AND THE LITTLE BLONDE GIRL. 
BEAT. 
THE LIGHT GOES ON AGAIN. 
WE SEE STARLING SWING TO A SITTING POSITION ON THE COUCH. SHE SIGHS.  SHE SHAKES HER HEAD TO CLEAR IT, AND SHE PULLS THE HANNIBAL FILE TO HER.  SHE PICKS UP A PENCIL, AND A PAIR OF READING GLASSES FROM THE TABLE, AND BEGINS MAKING NOTES ON THE FILE.

STARLING LOOKS FROM THE MAP ACROSS THE ROAD. 
ANGLE HER POV. 
A BARELY DISCERNIBLE BREAK IN THE FOLIAGE, BEAT, THEN STARLING' S CAR PULLS ACROSS THE ROAD, AND INTO THE POV AND ENTERS THE BREAK.

EMERGING FROM A THICK WOODS, THE CAR IS HINGED BY THE CAMERA ONTO THE PARK OF A COUNTRY ESTATE, THE CAR DISAPPEARS INTO A SMALL DIP IN THE LANDSCAPE. 
ANGLE EXT THE CAR, AT A GATEHOUSE, PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN BY THE CONTOUR OF THE LAND.  WE SEE A SMALL DECREPIT GATEHOUSE IN STONE, AND, BEYOND IT, A FLIMSY AND ANCIENT BARRICADE, AN OLD GAMEKEEPER TYPE IN TWEEDS COMES OUT OF THE GUARDHOUSE. HE IS CARRYING A MUG OF COFFEE AND HAS A NAPKIN TUCKED INTO HIS COLLAR.  HE REMOVES THE NAPKIN AND APPROACHES THE CAR. 
STARLING FLASHES HER CREDENTIALS TO THE OLD MAN, WHO HOLDS A CLIPBOARD. 
STARLING Special Agent Clarice Starling, to see Mason Verger. 
THE MAN AMBLES BACK INTO THE GATEHOUSE. 
ANGLE INT THE GATEHOUSE, THE OLD MAN ENTERS, AND CAMERA PULLS BACK TO SHOW, IN A ROOM OFF THE MAIN ROOM, THE FIT BODYGUARD TYPES, WATCHING STARLING ON A TV MONITOR.  THERE IS A RAFT OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT IN THE ROOM, AND A RACK WITH SEVERAL ASSAULT RIFLES ON IT.  ONE OF THE GUARDS IS TYPING ONTO A COMPUTER TERMINAL.  HE LOOKS AT THE RESULT, AND GLANCES UP AT STARLING, ON THE SCREEN, AND NODS "OKAY" TO THE OLD MAN.  THE OLD MAN AMBLES OUT TO THE BARRIER, HAVING PICKED UP AN OLD CLIPBOARD AT WHICH HE SQUINTS. 
THEN, SATISFIED, HE RAISES THE BARRIER, AND STARLING'S CAR GOES THROUGH. 
EXT A MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY ESTATE HOUSE. 
A POTATOCHIP VAN IS PARKED TO ONE SIDE IN THE WIDE DRIVE. AN OLD RETAINER HOLDS OPEN THE DOOR FOR STARLING, AS SHE EXITS FROM HER SEDAN, AND HE SHOWS HER INTO A LARGE OPEN MORNING ROOM, IN WHICH WE FIND TWENTY YOUNG CHILDREN OF VARIOUS RACES, ROMPING ON A SELECTION OF NEW TOYS.

ONE OF THEM IS REMOVING A TRAY OF COOKIES FROM THE OVEN, SEVERAL TYKES WAIT HAPPILY NEARBY.  THE COOK WITH THE TRAY OF COOKIES GIVES STARLING A WIDE GRIN. 
THE RETAINER TAKES STARLING PAST THE KITCHEN, TO A DOUBLE DOOR, WHICH HE OPENS TO REVEAL A CORRIDOR BEYOND, AND A LARGE FIT MAN IN HIS THIRTIES, WEARING AN ORDERLY'S WHITES, COMING TOWARD THE CAMERA.

CORDELL AND STARLING WALK DOWN THE CORRIDOR. 
STARLING The children...? 
CORDELL ...they're from Baltimore.... 
STARLING I've never heard that he... 
CORDELL It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does. 
BEAT. 
STARLING I won't take much of his time. 
CORDELL He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand... 
CAMERA TAKES STARLING DOWN A CORRIDOR LINED WITH HUNTINGPRINTS.  AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR AN OLD WOMAN SITS IN A WOODEN CHAIR, KNITTING. 
THEY HAVE STOPPED.  WAITING FOR THE WOMAN TO LOOK UP. STARLING'S GAZE IS DRAWN BY AN OLD, CREWEL-WORK "SAMPLER" FRAMED ON THE WALL BY THE OLD WOMAN'S CHAIR.  AND OBVIOUS ANTIQUE.  IT READS: 
"DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY.  DO NOT TRUST TO PROSPERITY."

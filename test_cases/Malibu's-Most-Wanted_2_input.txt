Tec aims at Brad. BRAD Please, don't be hatin'. Shondra steps in front of Brad. SHONDRA I won't let you do it, Tec. TEC No problem, then.   I'll just do the both of you. Tec levels the barrel at Shondra and Brad. He starts to squeeze the trigger when suddenly Bill's HUMMER CRASHES through the wall. I-9's scatter and duck as the Hummer's front grill skids to a stop inches from Tec. The driver's door pops open and Bill jumps out. 
TEC Damn fool!   You just hit my house! BILL (ignoring him) Brad!   Are you okay? BRAD Not really. And unless you seriously strapped, you about to be not really okay too. Bill turns:     six I-9s are aiming guns at he and Brad. BILL Hey there, fellas. Bill Gluckman... I'm running for governor. (CONTINUED) 
88   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              88 TEC We know who you are, fool. DEUCE You the candidate that's down with bitches and ho's. TEC Tsss. Dude think we ignorant just 'cause we live down here. You better recognize. BILL I absolutely recognize that street violence is tearing Californians apart... You see, guys, California is my family, and hey, here's a thought. Instead of thinking of ourselves as what set we're from, or what crew we're rolling with, why can't we just be brothers? What do you say? TEC (thoughtful) Hmmm. I guess I never looked at it like that before. What do you say, 'brothers'? The I-9's smile, cock their weapons, aim them, and just as they're about to start blasting, the side WALL EXPLODES and Hadji's dad's MERCEDES CRASHES through. TEC Don't anybody know where the driveway's at?! Damn! Gangsters fall back as Hadji, Mocha, and Monster jump out wearing the Kevlar vests and wielding their weapons. HADJI (freaking out) Better step, y'all, or I'ma have to waste all y'all up in this piece! MONSTER Yeah!   Drop yo gats! The I-9s, unafraid, point their guns right back at Hadji, Monster and Mocha. It's a multi-player Mexican standoff. (CONTINUED) 
88   CONTINUED:    (3)                                            88 DEUCE AND 8-BALL Drop your gats! Nobody does.     Brad steps out. BRAD Hold dup, y'all. Before anybody ices anybody I got to say something. No one stops him, so Brad turns to his dad. BRAD You really weren't gonna pay my ransom? 
BILL I didn't know anything about that. You've got to believe me, that was not part of the plan. BRAD What was the plan? Send me down here to scare me white? BILL It was stupid, I know. I thought I'd tried everything... I just didn't know how to deal with you anymore. BRAD You've never known how to deal with me 'cause you don't know me, and you never cared to find out. And now that your election's on the line, that's when you take a stand? That's bullshit, Pops. Look at me, 'cause this is who I am, and if you can't accept that, then I'll walk out that door, never see your sorry-ass again. Shondra, Tec, all the I-9's and Brad's posse slowly turn from Brad to Bill, completely caught in the moment, waiting for his response. BILL I'm not proud of myself, Brad. I made a lot of mistakes, and I know I wasn't there for you, and I can't change that, but I always loved you and still do... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
88   CONTINUED:    (4)                                                 88 BILL (CONT'D) ... and if you say this is really who you are, then I believe you and accept you, and from here on in, I promise to be a real father to you. BRAD Talk is cheap, Pops.    Prove it. BILL I'm here, ain't I? Brad looks at him.        Bill looks back.   Everyone looks on, riveted. BRAD A'ight, Pops, we cool. BILL Much love. They pound. 
ANGLE ON GANGSTERS getting emotional.        A couple sniffle, a few wipe their eyes. 8-BALL (sincere) Wish I could talk to my pops like that. 
DEUCE (emotional) No doubt. He's raising his kid. 8-BALL (dialing his cell, wiping tears) I'ma call my pops right now. TEC Would y'all get a hold of your fool selves?! It's time to waste these punks! The I-9s straighten up and re-aim their guns. (CONTINUED) 
88   CONTINUED:    (5)                                               88 BRAD (with confidence) Tec, before we all go out in a blaze of glory, can I say one last thing? TEC (sighs) Whatchya got to say? BRAD Moch, kick it freestyle. Mocha rests the musket in the crook of his arm, and does his human beat box thing as Brad begins to rap. BRAD 'What's up with all this fightin'? We all should be unitin'! Y'all egos need deflatin', Gangstas, please, quit all this hatin'.' TEC Stop, please! If I hear you drop one more rhyme, I'ma hafta smoke myself. BRAD A'ight, cool, but all these gats got to go! As Brad grabs the missile launcher from Hadji... MOCHA (moved, earnest) Word up, B. All this hatin' is wack! Mocha slams the butt of the musket down, and the flintlock slams forward. Everyone cringes. Nothing happens. Everyone looks at the MUSKET, then suddenly it EXPLODES and a rusty musket ball FIRES OUT, slamming Monster in the middle of her Kevlar breastplate. She flies back and slams into the wall, causing her spear gun to fire -- a SPEAR SHOOTS OUT and lands directly into Brad's left ass cheek. Brad howls and drops the MISSILE LAUNCHER... SLOW MOTION:     everyone watches it fall to the ground... REAL TIME:     it hits the floor and the MISSILE FIRES. (CONTINUED)

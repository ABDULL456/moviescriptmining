DOLL (sweetly) Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy. 
MOTHER You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear. 
DOLL I'm only trying to help him, Mother. 
BUDDY Heh, what a hypocrite. 
MOTHER (to Daddy) I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again. 
DADDY (stares sternly at Buddy) Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother. 
MOTHER (genuinely worried) I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him. 
DADDY I'll take him with me downtown. (glances at Rose as she comes with coffee) And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride. 
ROSE Sure, love one. Here's your half-a cup of coffee. 
Daddy is staring with a very dubious frown at Rose's skirt. He slowly shakes his head. 
DADDY That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on. 
ROSE (happy, pleased by his interest) Well, it has buttons. 
Points to little buttons on right side of the skirt. 
DADDY How can the buttons stand the pressure? 
ROSE There are more on the other side. 
Points to buttons on left side. 
DADDY Turn around, darlin'. 
Happy to oblige, Rose turns around. Her plump, round, feminine behind is only too plainly revealed through the thin material. Daddy slowly shakes his head. 
DADDY (CONT'D) They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked. 
MOTHER (a wee mite worried) Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place. 
DADDY Who doesn't have such thoughts? (glances at wristwatch) We'd better get going. 
MOTHER You're not having lunch? 
DADDY Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road. 
MOTHER Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer. 
ROSE Yes, Ma'am. 
MOTHER Doll, you and Waski run on, too. 
EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY 
CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy as they walk out onto the patio of the house. Rose walks down the steps to the flower garden and Buddy follows. 
ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose and Buddy as Rose picks a red rose and puts it in her hair.' 
ROSE Did your Momma really give you castor oil? 
BUDDY Yeah. 
ROSE (puts an arm around his shoulders) You're my sweetheart. 
INT. HILLYER HOME KITCHEN - DAY 
CUT TO Mother and Daddy at the kitchen table. 
MOTHER (earnestly) I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better. 
DADDY The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her. 
MOTHER Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention. 
DADDY She will succeed. 
MOTHER I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it. 
DADDY (musingly) That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why. 
MOTHER He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children. 
DADDY Well, she loves children, all right. (adds dryly) She loves everybody.

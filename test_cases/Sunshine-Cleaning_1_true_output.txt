The businessman approaches the gun display and points to a shotgun. An employee hands him the gun and turns his attention to another customer. 
The businessman reaches into his pocket and pulls out the shotgun shell. Loads it. Draws the barrel up under his chin. 
A Bubba pricing camouflaged vests nearby notices the businessman. His expression shifts from concern to alarm to horrible anticipation. He braces for the...

11   INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - LATER                                11 
Police mill about and question people. CARL SWANSON, a 40ish man sporting a crew cut and a `Above and Beyond' polo shirt, talks to the STORE OWNER. 
CARL Yep, these shotgun cases are a real pain in the ass. What we call a wide field of contamination. (MORE)

The owner rubs his temples. 
CARL Gonna lose some inventory. 
OWNER Selfish bastard. 
CARL Trust me, you do not want some lady suing you cuz she found this guy's tooth in her brand new fanny pack. 
A ABOVE AND BEYOND WORKER in a polo shirt waves his arm to get Carl's attention. 
CLEAN SWEEP WORKER He's over here in fishing too. 
CARL Yep, a real pain in the ass. 
Carl walks over to his assistant. Detective, `MAC' MACDOWELL, approaches the owner. 
MAC We're wrapping it up. 
OWNER Three grand just to have the asshole wiped up off the floor. Can you believe that? 
Mac and another DETECTIVE walk toward the entrance. 
MAC Hey, can you handle the report tonight? I gotta thing I gotta do. 
DETECTIVE A blonde thing or a brunette thing? 
12   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT                              12 
Rose steps from the shower. She is attractive with sharp features and eyes that hint at future crow's feet. Her confidence has grown brittle by the gnawing fear that life peaked as the captain of the high school cheerleading squad.

A note taped to the bathroom mirror reads: `You are strong. You are powerful. You can do anything. You are a winner.' 
Rose wipes condensation from the mirror to reveal her face. 
ROSE I am strong. I am powerful. I can do anything. I am a winner. 
She doesn't look like she believes it. 
13   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                       13 
Norah lounges on her bed and loads weed onto a jerry-rigged pop-can-pipe. 
NORAH The fact that we have sex, real coitus sex, means I'm under no obligation to blow you. 
Norah fires up the bud, inhales deeply and passes the can to RANDY, a good-looking redneck in his early 20's. 
RANDY I think you're scared of it. 
The phone RINGS. 
Norah opens a book about sign language and starts practicing the sign alphabet. A-B-C-D-E-F. F is a hard one. 
NORAH (Holding in the smoke) I'm not scared of it. 
RANDY Uncomfortable then. You just need to get better acquainted. 
Norah exhales. Randy stands and takes off his pants. The phone RINGS again. 
NORAH (yelling) Dad, get the phone. 
RANDY There's absolutely no pressure here.

Randy lies next to Norah naked from the waist down. Norah ignores him and continues forming letters with her fingers. She jots a note and sticks the pencil behind her ear. 
The phone RINGS again. Norah reaches across Randy and picks up the receiver. 
RANDY You can touch it if you want. 
NORAH (into phone) Hello. 
ROSE (O.S.) (through receiver) You haven't left yet? Damn it Norah, my class starts in fifteen minutes. 
NORAH (into phone) I know, I know. 
As Norah holds the phone her eyes slide from Randy's face to his off screen penis. She takes the pencil from behind her ear and, in the way you'd poke a hamster to see if it is dead or merely sleeping, prods Randy's off screen penis.

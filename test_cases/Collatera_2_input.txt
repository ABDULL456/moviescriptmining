LENNY (O.S.) Who the hell are you? 
Vincent glances up, tilts the visor down to see Annie's business card. 
VINCENT Richard Riccardo, Assistant U.S.                         * Attorney. A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV... 
LENNY (O.S.) (beat) Let's not get excited. 
VINCENT Not excited? How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you try to extort a working man? You know                           * goddamn well your collision policy and                   * general liability umbrella would cover the damages. What are you trying to pull, you sarcastic prick? 
LENNY (O.S.) I'm just tryin' to...to... 
VINCENT Tell it to him. (shifts the mike) Tell him he's an asshole. 
MAX (hesitates) You're an asshole. 
VINCENT Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna stick this yellow cab up his fat ass. 
MAX Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna stick this yellow cab up your fat ass. 
Vincent clicks off, hangs up the mike.   Looks at Max. 
Beat.   Max, taped to the steering wheel, nods. 
VINCENT (smiles) Don't wait up, hon.   I gotta work late.

He grabs the ignition keys, shuts Max's door, strolls away.

Max watches in the sideview mirror as Vincent vanishes into the building. 
Max is left alone, trapped in his own cab in the alley. 
Max jerks and strains against the duct tape, trying to free his hands. He gives up, breathing hard.

The overweight LAWYER, SYLVESTER CLARKE, who we saw on Vincent's P.C., separates from two girls and a second man, all watching TV, to answer a phone... 
SYLVESTER CLARKE                                  * He identify himself?                                        * (beat)                                                  * Sure. Let him up.                                           *

He glances in the sideview, wondering where Vincent is, straining for a glimpse. 
Nothing.   Just darkness back there...   Mind racing... 
MAX HEY!   HEY! OVER HERE!    I'M IN THE CAB!   HEY! HELP! 
The street traffic's distant; nobody's around. 
MAX (CONT'D) HELP! GODDAMN IT! THERE'S A MAN WITH A GUN! HE'S GONNA KILL PEOPLE! 
Max thrashes wildly against the duct tape, screaming with frustration. He starts head-butting the car horn... 
BEEEEEP!   BEEP-BEEEEEEEEP!   BEEEEEP!   BEEP-BEEP-BEEEEEEEEEP! 
He raises his head, checking the street traffic a quarter block away. No one on the sidewalk takes notice of Max's cab.

MAX (CONT'D) Oh, fuck me. 
He shifts low on the seat, getting his knee under the dashboard. He slams his knee up, hitting the RED EMERGENCY LIGHT BUTTON concealed there. EMERGENCY STROBES START FLASHING at the front and rear of the car... 
...and still nobody notices. 
MAX (CONT'D) GODDAMN IT, I'M FLASHING LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE OVER HERE. 
He throws a look to the sideview mirror, sweaty and tense, knowing he's out of time.

THE SIDEVIEW MIRROR 
IN WHICH WE SEE Max's reflected eyes.   Seconds ticking breathlessly away as he struggles... 
He head butts the horn again.   BEEP-BEEP.   BEEEEP.    Flashers and horn! 
MEANWHILE the ANGLE SHIFTS in the mirror, leaving Max's eyes and bringing into view the building and the penthouse at the top and we SEE... 
...TWO SILENT MUZZLE FLASHES light up the windows like flashbulbs going off. Another death. Then A THIRD FLASH...then nothing. Lights out. Meanwhile... 
MAX (CONT'D)                                      * Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.                                  * 
He is head-butting the horn. BEEEEP. BEEP-BEEP.        And he checks   * the mirror. This time when he looks, he sees...

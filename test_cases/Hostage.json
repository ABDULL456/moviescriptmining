{"train": "Hostage \nby \nRobert Crais \nbased on his novel \nMarch 29, 2002 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. A HYPERBLUE LOS ANGELES SKY -- DAY \nThe sky is overlaid with the slow whup-whup-whup of an LAPD helicopter flashing through the frame, here and gone. \nLAPD radio transmissions crackle like static electricity around a dirty clapboard bungalow that looks like the puckered asshole of Eagle Rock. \nA man's terrified voice screams invisibly from the house -- \nMALIK'S VOICE I'm gonna kill this dog!  You make my wife talk to me or I'm gonna shoot this fuckin' dog! \nA five-member SWAT tactical team appears out of nowhere--full black assault gear, M5s, gloved and masked--hustling into position on either side of the front door.  Only now do we get the full picture:  Helicopters overhead, radio cars surrounding the house, an army of cops itching the pull the trigger -- \nWhen the tac team is good to go, the team leader gives a thumbs-up to -- \nSERGEANT JEFF TALLEY AND LT. MURRAY LEIFITZ \nTalley and Leifitz are hunkered behind the LAPD Command and Control van.  Leifitz is the Crisis Response Team SWAT commander; Talley, the primary negotiator.  It's so hot out here that Talley has stripped down to a tee-shirt and vest. \nLEIFITZ They're good to go, Talley.  Your word, and we're in the house. \nTALLEY No one's going anywhere, L-T.  We can talk this guy down. \nTalley lifts a dedicated crisis phone that's been hardlined into the house, his tone reasonable and friendly -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) (into the phone) Hey, George?  George, don't kill the dog, okay?  We don't want to hear a gun go off in there. \nA phone crashes through the window and lands in the front yard -- \nMALIK'S VOICE (screaming from the house) Fuck you! \nLEIFITZ I don't think he wants to talk. \nFrustrated, Talley slumps back against the van as the SWAT Intelligence Officer, Lloyd Keith, scuttles up to them -- \nTALLEY Where's the guy's wife? \nKEITH She didn't take the kid to her sister's. The neighbors were wrong. \nTALLEY Goddamnit, you said we had her.  I told him we had her! \nKEITH We got bad information, Talley.  I can't pull her out of my ass! \nUp at the house, George Edward Malik steps into the window. Malik is a forty-year-old freaked-out loser who has turned the corner on insanity -- \nMALIK (shouting at Talley) You said my wife was gonna talk to me, you lying fuck!  I'm gonna kill her dog, then shoot myself!  I mean it! \nTalley stares at Malik, thinking, then abruptly grabs Keith by the collar -- \nTALLEY (to Keith) Pull the dog's name out of your ass.  Get the dog's name. \nTalley steps out from behind the command van so that Malik can see him. \nLEIFITZ (alarmed by Talley's move) Talley!  You're in the line of fire! \nTalley ignores Leifitz; he is totally focused on Malik and on defusing the situation -- \nTALLEY I didn't lie to you, George.  You scared your wife pretty good last night.  We're having a hard time finding her. \nMALIK She better talk to me!  I'm gonna kill her goddamned dog! \nTALLEY You and I have been talking for, what, sixteen hours?  Keep talking.  Is that your dog, too? \nMalik steps away from the window -- \nMALIK'S VOICE I don't know whose dog it is.  She lied about everything else, so she probably lied about the dog. \nTALLEY I know you're hurting.  You lose your job, you find out your wife's fucking another guy . . . but don't give up. We'll have her talk to you. \nMALIK'S VOICE Then why won't she open her mouth?!  Why doesn't the bitch say something??? \nSomething about Malik's statement bothers Talley.  The wording is odd, suspicious -- \nTALLEY George?  Come back to the window. \nMALIK'S VOICE STOP LOOKING AT ME!!! \nTalley grows even more concerned.  Was Malik talking to him? \nTALLEY George?  Leave the dog alone and come to the window. \nTalley sees Keith rejoin Leifitz -- \nMargaret watches their red pickup lurch away, then rushes into the store -- \nINT. THE TRUCK -- DAY \nDennis power-shifts into gear, clashing tortured metal as he pushes the Toyota as hard as it will go.  No one is talking; they're screaming -- \nKEVIN There's fuckin' blood all over you! \nDENNIS I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off! \nDennis sees himself in the rearview mirror.  His face is splattered with red dew, the sight of it freaking him out -- \nDENNIS (CONT'D) Jesus!  Fuckin' Jesus, it's on my face! \nThe trunk careens crazily off the road.  Mars calmly runs a hand over Dennis's face -- \nMARS Relax.  It's only blood. \nDennis upshifts hard again, the truck lurching as the tranny howls -- \nDENNIS FUCK you, Mars!  I got it all over me! \n-- whereupon the tortured transmission gives with a loud BANG and the truck loses power -- \nDENNIS (CONT'D) MotherFUCKING piece of SHIT!!! \nEXT. FLANDERS ROAD -- DAY \nFlanders Road is lined with trees, hedges, and the exclusive housing developments that dot the countryside around Bristo Camino. \nThe Toyota jerks to a stop well off the road, and Dennis, Mars, and Kevin pile out, stuffing pistols and bullets into their pockets -- \nKEVIN That woman's gonna call the cops. \nDENNIS Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down! \nKEVIN What if he's dead?  What if you killed him? \nDennis grabs him by the throat; Mars steps between them -- \nMARS People are looking. \nDennis sees that Mars is right; people in passing cars are looking.  He releases his brother -- \nDENNIS That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder. \nKEVIN We're on foot.  We can't get away. \nDENNIS We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one. \nDennis and Mars take off for the wall, Kevin reluctantly following -- \nEXT. WALTER SMITH'S HOME -- THE CUL-DE-SAC -- DAY \nThe camera reveals a two-story California Mediterranean home in the exclusive housing development known as York Estates. You can't get in the door for less than one-point-five, and this house costs more:  Eight thousand square feet of used brick and custom tile set on a lushly landscaped acre -- \nWALTER SMITH'S VOICE You can pick them up whenever you want. \nINT. WALTER SMITH'S OFFICE -- DAY \nWalter Smith is at his computer behind his desk.  He's forty and fit, casually dressed with thinning hair and glasses, currently leaning back as he talks on his phone -- \nWALTER (into the phone) I have his corporate and personal on two disks, labeled Marlon and Al. \nAs Smith talks, he ejects a Zip disk from his computer, attaches a label reading Al, then places it in a palm-sized case beside the first disk, Marlon -- \nWALTER (CONT'D) What, you don't have a sense of humor? He's going to love it. \nWalter's ten-year-old son, Thomas, suddenly charges around the desk and pulls at his father's arm -- \nTHOMAS My stomach is eating me! \nWALTER (into the phone) Yeah, that's Thomas, the human piranha. I have to feed the animals while Pam's in Florida with her sister. \nTHOMAS My stomach has teeth!  It's eating my guts! \nWALTER (still with the phone) Listen, is Glen on his way?  Great.  The paper's bagged and ready to go.  Bye. (hangs up; then) All right, all right, all right--it's feeding time! \nWalter allows his son to pull him around the desk to -- \nEXT. THE SMITHS' BACK YARD -- THE POOL -- DAY \nA boom box blasts the latest teendiva megahit as Walter's sixteen-year-old daughter, Jennifer, stretches out in cutoff shorts and a bikini top, working on her tan. \nWalter and Thomas appear in the French doors that open from the back of the house -- \nWALTER (calling) Jen!  Come feed your brother!  He's wasting away! \nJENNIFER Can't we send him to Florida? \nWALTER Jen, c'mon, chop-chop!  I've got to finish my work! \nJennifer rolls her eyes, rises from the chaise longue, and pads to the house.  As she clears the frame, the camera swings toward the overgrown wall at the edge of the property. Dennis silenty drops into the bushes -- \nWELCH (into his radio mike) They had to go through the yard at 455 Castle Way.  I'm going to approach. \nWelch slowly moves up the walk toward the front door -- \nINT. THE ENTRY -- DAY \nDennis shoves Jennifer to the door -- \nDENNIS Open it!  You remember I'm right here! \nEXT. THE HOUSE -- WITH WELCH \nWelch is halfway up the walk when the door opens and Jennifer, clearly terrified, peers out.  Welch hesitates -- \nWELCH (into his mike) Teenage female opened the front door. (to Jennifer) Miss, I found an abandoned vehicle on the other side of your wall.  Did three young men run through the area? \nJennifer doesn't answer.  Her eyes fill until two huge tears roll down her cheeks.  Welch grows uneasy.  Something is wrong, but he doesn't know what.  He stays where he is -- \nWELCH (CONT'D) Miss? \nJENNIFER I didn't . . . see anyone. \nWelch stares into Jennifer's eyes, pointedly shifting his gaze to ask the silent question:  Are they here? \nINT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- MARS AND KEVIN \nare peering out the shutters when -- \nMars suddenly shouts -- \nMARS He's going for his gun! \nMars opens fire, shooting through the window as -- \nDENNIS \nkicks the door closed and fires through the door, Jennifer screaming, as -- \nEXT. THE HOUSE -- DAY -- MIKE WELCH \ntumbles backward, struggling weakly to pull his gun as blood bubbles in his mouth.  He tries to rise, but can't -- \nWELCH (into his radio) Officer down.  Jesus, I've been shot. \nRADIO VOICE Mike?  Mike, what did you say?! \nMike Welch blinks at the sky, but cannot answer -- \nINT. BRISTO CAMINO POLICE DEPARTMENT -- DAY \nIt's the kind of small-town police facility you might expect: A general room with desks and computers, a coffee machine, and a desk officer who thinks that crime is two teenagers egging a house. \nThe camera establishes the low-key atmosphere, during which it finds a glass door labeled J. Talley, chief of police -- \nINT. TALLEY'S OFFICE -- DAY \nJeff Talley is behind the desk, his voice muted because he is locked in a painful phone conversation -- \nTALLEY (into phone) It's really hard, Jane.  This isn't the way I want it. \nINT. JANE'S KITCHEN -- DAY \nJane Talley is an attractive woman in her mid-thirties.  She has the efficient manner of a registered nurse, which she is, and right now she's using all of her professional detachment to keep herself together -- \nJANE (into phone) No?  Then whose idea was it for you take a job in the middle of nowhere? \nIntercut Talley, who considers the photographs that decorate his wall:  Shots of Talley in happier times with Jane and their teenaged daughter, Amanda; Talley as a young SWAT officer; the framed headline from the Bristo Weekly Standard proclaiming:  EX-SWAT COP NEW BRISTO CHIEF! \nTALLEY I need to work out some stuff. \nJANE You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me. \nTALLEY I still see that boy's eyes. \nJane softens; she knows that a part of him is in terrible pain.  But she's in pain, too -- \nJANE That happened a year ago.  You've been gone for almost six months.  How long do you have to punish yourself for something that wasn't your fault? \nTalley studies the picture of his wife and daughter.  He focuses on Amanda -- \nTALLEY Is Amanda there? \nJane cups the phone and calls to her daughter.  Amanda enters and goes to the refrigerator.  She's fifteen and carrying the weight of a seriously bad attitude -- \nJANE (to Amanda) It's Dad.  He wants to speak with you. \nAMANDA (doesn't even glance over) I'm gonna see him later. \nJANE (back to Talley) She has to go to the bathroom. \nJane turns away and lowers her voice, not wanting Amanda to hear -- \nJANE (CONT'D) You're not only punishing yourself, Jeff. Amanda and I are in this, too. \nTALLEY (CONT'D) This is Talley.  Who's on? \nHis radio crackles with overlapping voices -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) One at a time!  Clear the air! (as they settle) Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have? \nLOUISE'S VOICE Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital. \nFrantic voices once more overlap -- \nCOP VOICES What about Mike?  Is Welch alive?  What happened? \nTALLEY (forcefully) Quiet!  I want radio discipline. (as they quiet) Mike's hanging in.  Larry, Jorgy?  Listen up. \nJORGENSON'S VOICE Go, Chief. \nTALLEY Find out who lives at four-five-five.  We gotta know who's in there. \nLOUISE'S VOICE Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door. \nTALLEY Did he say if she was shooting at him? \nLOUISE'S VOICE (hesitant) He didn't say. \nTALLEY Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up? \nMIKKELSON'S VOICE We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer. \nTALLEY Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it? \nMIKKELSON'S VOICE It's right in front of us. \nTALLEY Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name. \nLOUISE'S VOICE I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart. \nTALLEY Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there. \nLOUISE'S VOICE We only have eight officers on duty, Chief. \nMore sirens are approaching, but their help seems too little, too late.  Talley stares up the cul-de-sac at the Smiths' house as if this was a terrible nightmare -- \nTALLEY (to himself) That's not enough. \nLOUISE What's that, Chief?  Say again. \nTALLEY Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation. \nINT. WALTER SMITH'S OFFICE -- DAY \nGunsmoke fills the air.  Kevin is freaking.  He throws a magazine at Mars -- \nKEVIN We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot! \nDENNIS Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us! \nKEVIN We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse. \nJENNIFER Get out of our house! \nHer voice cuts through the din. \nJennifer and Thomas are huddled with their father on the floor, Jennifer's arms crossed to cover herself -- \nWALTER (softly) Quiet, Jen. \nJENNIFER Why don't they go?!  Why don't they leave us alone and go?! \nDennis charges up to her, screaming and waving his gun -- \nDENNIS Shut up!  Shut the fuck up! \nWalter Smith slowly stands -- \nWALTER None of you will get out of this. \nDennis spins toward Walter, leveling his gun -- \nDENNIS Stay down!  Stay down, goddamnit! \nWALTER I'm going to my desk. \nDENNIS You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor! \nDennis raises the gun to Walter's face.  Walter is in complete command of himself and nowhere near scared, but Jennifer grabs his legs -- \nJENNIFER Daddy, don't! \nWALTER (casually; to Dennis) Take it easy, son.  I'm only going to my desk. \nWalter eases past Dennis, who doesn't know what to do -- \nDENNIS Get on the floor! \nDennis finally relents and shrugs at Mars -- \nDENNIS Make sure Kevin isn't fucking off back there. \nJennifer hurries out as Mars follows -- \nINT. THE KITCHEN -- DAY \nJennifer goes to the counter.  Kevin is at the French doors, nervous and scared; Mars is a dark shadow behind her -- \nShe kneels to a low cabinet when Mars kicks it shut -- \nMARS I thought you wanted ice. \nMars towers over her, his groin inches from her face -- \nJENNIFER I'm getting a wash cloth for the ice. \nMars gazes down at her, enjoying his size and power.  He steps closer, bringing his groin closer to his face. Jennifer stands, holding her arms across her breasts -- \nJENNIFER (CONT'D) Please get away from me. \nKEVIN (from the background) Mars?  What are you doing? \nKevin's intrusion shatters the moment.  Jennifer quickly snatches a wash cloth from the cabinet, then takes an ice tray from the freezer and brings it back to the counter -- \nAs Jennifer puts ice in the wash cloth, she sees the paring knife that she used for the sandwiches partially hidden by paper towels -- \nShe glances at Kevin, but cannot see Mars; he's at the refrigerator behind her.  Jennifer slowly reaches for the knife -- \nMARS Hey. \nJennifer freezes, terrified.  She pushes the knife behind the Cuisinart to hide it, then turns.  Mars is offering her a beer. \nMARS (CONT'D) Want one? \nJENNIFER I don't drink beer. \nMARS Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know. \nJENNIFER What I want is to help my father. \nJennifer hurries past him and disappears down the hall.  Even as she leaves the phone starts ringing -- \nINT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- DAY \nThe phone seems to ring louder here.  Dennis stands over it, watching the phone as if it's alive.  The phone rings again and again.  Finally, he answers -- \nDENNIS Hello? \nEXT. TALLEY'S CAR -- IN THE CUL-DE-SAC -- DAY \nTalley is once more behind his car.  He's on his cell phone, with Jorgenson nearby -- \nTALLEY (into his phone) My name is Jeff Talley.  Is this Dennis Rooney? \nIntercut Dennis on the phone in Walter's office -- \nDENNIS You with the cops? \nTALLEY The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car? \nDennis peers through the shutters -- \nDENNIS Yeah.  I'm Rooney. \nTALLEY We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there? \nDennis shoots a guilty glance at Walter, then lies -- \nDENNIS We're cool. \nTALLEY Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him. \nDENNIS Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me. \nTALLEY How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you? \nDENNIS They're fine. \nTalley cups the phone to tell Jorgenson -- \nTALLEY All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house. (back to the phone) Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation -- \nDENNIS (interrupting) You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself. \nTALLEY Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died. \nDENNIS How about the cop? \nTALLEY Dennis?  I want you to release those people. \nDENNIS Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away. \nDEVARONA Married but separated, ex-LAPD.  The fam doesn't live here, but they're coming up today.  I got his address there. \nMANELLI The cops I talked to, they said Talley was a hostage negotiator in LA. \nDEVARONA His last three years on the job.  Before that, he was SWAT. \nMike Ruiz joins in -- \nRUIZ How's a SWAT negotiator make it up here to this shithole? \nDEVARONA I make him for a stress release. \nHOWELL Good work, Gayle--everybody.  Now stay ahead of the curve.  I want to know everything that happens before it happens.  I'll cover Talley. \nHowell tears Talley's address off the yellow pad.  This meeting is over -- \nSEYMORE What if it goes south? \nHOWELL What do you mean? \nSEYMORE If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end. \nHOWELL You worry about your end.  I got my side covered. \nHowell tucks the address in his pocket and goes to the door. \nEXT. DONUT SHOP -- NEWHALL, CALIFORNIA -- NIGHT \nThe sun has set.  The donut shop glows greasily at the end of a strip mall.  It is empty except for the overweight woman behind the counter and a lone man seated at a window booth -- \nINT. THE DONUT SHOP -- NIGHT \nThe man in the booth is named Marion Clewes.  He's an average looking guy, more or less, except for the strange cant to his right eye and the thin black tie he wears over his white J. C. Penney shirt.  His jacket doesn't fit quite right, but not so much as you'd notice.  Marion could disappear into a crowd just by being so ordinary.  That's the point. \nA fat black desert fly, heavy with juice and thorny with coarse hair, buzzes past -- \nMarion watches it, only his eyes moving -- \nThe fly lands in the sprinkles of sugar on the table -- \nMarion watches it, then, suddenly, with no warning, his hand flashes out, slamming down on the table. \nHe holds his hand in place, feeling for movement, then slowly peeks under his hand -- \nThe fly oozes sideways, legs kicking, trying to walk.  One wing beats furiously; the other is broken -- \nMarion examines his hand.  A smear of fly goo and a single black leg streaks his third finger.  Marion touches his tongue to the smear -- \nThe woman behind the counter watches this, her eyes widening with disgust -- \nMarion holds the fly in place with his left index finger, and uses his right to break away another leg.  He eats this leg, too -- \nThe woman disappears into the rear -- \nHeadlights flash across the glass, and Marion swivels around to see Howell's Mercedes pull up -- \nMarion carefully pushes the still-alive fly aside as Glen Howell takes a seat across from him.  Howell puts the yellow slip with Talley's address on the table -- \nHOWELL Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not. \nMARION It won't be a problem. \nHOWELL He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him. \nMARION Okey-doke. \nHOWELL We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him. \nMarion puts Talley's address into his pocket. \nMARION Can we make him dead after we use him? \nGlen Howell slides out of the booth without answering. Marion creeps him out -- \nHOWELL Whatever you want.  Page me when you're done. \nHowell starts away, then turns back -- \nHOWELL (CONT'D) Donuts here any good? \nMARION I don't eat junk food. \nHowell frowns like he might've known, then walks away. Marion turns back to the fly -- \nIt lays there, still, until Marion prods it.  The remaining wing flutters -- \nMarion breaks off the remaining wing and eats that, too. \nEXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT \nTalley and Leigh Metzger stride through a pool of street light as she reports -- \nMETZGER PacBell shows six lines into the house. They blocked all six like you wanted. \nThomas slaps the tape back over her mouth.  Jennifer struggles helplessly as Thomas slips back into the closet, and is gone -- \nEXT. YORK ESTATES -- STREET -- NIGHT \nThe Sheriff's Crisis Response Team rolls through the streets like an invading army:  A brown sedan leads a huge van known as the Mobile Command Post, which is followed by a Sheriff's SWAT support vehicle, two SWAT Suburbans, and four radio units. \nPools of light from the helicopters follow their progress -- \nEXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT \nTalley walks out to meet the lead vehicle as the convoy stops.  Up and down the row, uniformed Sheriffs pile out of their vehicles and off-load their gear -- \nTwo people climb out of the lead car:  Will Maddox, a bespectacled African-American Sheriff's SWAT negotiator, and Captain Laura Martin, the CRT commander -- \nTALLEY I'm Talley.  Who's in charge? \nMARTIN Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator -- \nMADDOX Is the perimeter around the house secure? \nTALLEY I've got fourteen officers on my department including me.  We're as secure as we can be. \nMADDOX (to Martin) Permission to deploy the line? \nMARTIN Do it. \nTALLEY (to Maddox) Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile. \nMaddox turns away to bark orders into his shoulder mike -- \nMARTIN Sounds like you know the job. \nTALLEY I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him. \nMARTIN (over her shoulder) Maddox!  You got that? \nMADDOX Doing it now! \nMARTIN (back to Talley) I'd like you to brief my supervisors before we take over the scene. \nTALLEY Whatever you want. \nTalley and Martin hurry toward her troops -- \nINT. THE SMITHS' GARAGE -- NIGHT \nThe garage is dark, lit only by the light that comes from the kitchen's open door, as Dennis, Mars and a reluctant Kevin enter -- \nKEVIN Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up? \nDENNIS (annoyed) That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this -- \nDennis shows them a small casement window, and pushes open the window to reveal a thick hedge -- \nDENNIS (CONT'D) (excited) These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free. \nKEVIN That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us. \nDENNIS Not if they're looking at something else. \nKEVIN Like what? \nMARS Let's burn the house. \nMars says it so simply that the moment is frozen.  Mars is holding the big claw hammer, kneading it as if it was a living thing.  His face is masked by shadows, but his eyes both glow as if already reflecting flame -- \nINT. CRAWLSPACE ABOVE THE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT \nWe see Dennis, Kevin, and Mars through a slit overhead as they emerge from the garage and move back into the house -- \nThomas is watching them.  He has cracked open the service hatch in the laundry room ceiling to make sure that his way is clear -- \nINT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT \nThe room is dark.  When Dennis and the others are gone, the ceiling hatch lifts, and Thomas lets himself down.  He slides onto the washing machine and then to the floor -- \nThomas cups one hand over his flashlight and turns it on.  He lets light leak through his fingers so that he can see.  The beam cuts across a door to the garage, car keys on key hooks, and Jennifer's purse hanging from one of the hooks -- \nINT. HOBBY ROOM -- NIGHT \nThis is a small room off the end of the laundry with a work bench, a stool, and shelves above the bench for Walter's hobby supplies -- \nThomas shines the light over the shelves, spotting the hard plastic pistol case on the highest shelf.  That's the target; that's the goal -- \nThomas uses the stool to climb onto the bench -- \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nDennis is in the doorway to the security closet, handing out one of the money bags to Kevin -- \nKEVIN We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy. \nDENNIS I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives. \nTALLEY (to Maddox) Then get your men off the wall! (to Martin) You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I know this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him. \nMARTIN (to Maddox) Order your men to stand down. \nThe phone is still ringing.  Talley pulls the mike from the deputy's car and speaks over the public address -- \nTALLEY (over the p.a.) Look out the window, Dennis.  We are NOT entering the house.  We're pulling back. \nINT. SMITH'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nDennis is holding Thomas around the neck, using the boy as a shield.  Kevin is cowering on the floor and Mars is holding Jennifer.  Dennis snatches up the phone -- \nDENNIS (screaming into the phone) You fuck!  I got a fuckin' gun to this kid's head!  I'll kill'm, you fuck! \nIntercut Talley outside -- \nTALLEY It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone. \nDENNIS (still screaming) We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here! \nTalley takes a deep breath; he forces himself to speak quietly, calmly -- \nTALLEY No one's coming in.  A couple of guys out here got carried away. \nDennis peers out the front.  Talley's careful manner is calming him -- \nDENNIS Goddamned right they got carried away. It looks like an army out there. \nTalley mutes the phone to speak to Martin -- \nTALLEY (to Martin) It's over.  He's cooling off. \nTalley glances at Maddox.  Maddox nods, his expression saying that Talley was right -- \nDENNIS Talley? \nTALLEY (back into the phone) I'm here. \nDENNIS I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico. \nTALLEY That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter. \nDENNIS I'll give you these people. \nTALLEY The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us. (mutes phone; to Martin and Maddox) I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go? \nMaddox nods at Martin; he's good to go -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) (to Dennis) Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret? \nDENNIS (hesitantly) What? \nTALLEY I gotta piss real bad. \nDennis can't help himself; he laughs -- \nDENNIS You're a funny guy, Talley. \nTALLEY I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while. \nTalley hands the phone to Maddox, who moves past Talley for a better view of the house.  Talley looks grimly at Martin -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) He says he has gasoline set to burn the place. \nMARTIN Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars. \nTALLEY If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up. \nMARTIN (not without humor) Looks like you're bailing out at the right time. \nTALLEY (returns her smile) That's why you get the big bucks, Captain. \nTalley is moving away when his radio pops -- \nLOUISE'S VOICE Chief, base. \nTALLEY (keying his shoulder mike) Go. \nLOUISE'S VOICE I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant. \nTALLEY You have her cell number? \nLOUISE'S VOICE She didn't answer. \nTALLEY They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer. \nTalley closes his phone and continues away -- \nINT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nDennis and Kevin are at the television, watching an aerial view of the Sheriffs deploying around the house.  Jennifer and Thomas are huddled by their father -- \nKEVIN We're surrounded.  They're all over the neighborhood. \nTalley hurries to a large sketch of the Smiths' floor plan laid out on the dining room table -- \nTALLEY That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you? \nTHOMAS They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open. \nMartin enters with Leigh Metzger.  Talley cups the phone to give her the headline -- \nTALLEY (to Martin) I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone. (back to Thomas) What was that, son?  I didn't hear you. \nTHOMAS If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too -- \nThomas hears someone outside his door -- \nTHOMAS (CONT'D) They're coming! \nThomas hangs up, jamming his phone behind the bed -- \nTALLEY Thomas?  Thomas...? \nTalley lowers the phone -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) He says that his father's hurt. \nMARTIN If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in. \nTALLEY They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming. \nMARTIN Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger? \nTALLEY No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying. \nMARTIN Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree? \nTalley finally nods -- \nTALLEY You want me to stick around, I could -- \nMARTIN You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call. \nTalley looks like the most tired guy in the world.  He nods his good-night, then turns away -- \nINT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT \nTalley slides into his car outside Mrs. Pena's home.  He's got a lot on his mind, and not all of it centers around 455 Castle Way.  He punches a number into his cell phone -- \nHe listens to ringing, and then his own voice answers -- \nTALLEY'S VOICE MESSAGE This is Jeff Talley.  Leave your name and number after the beep. \nWe hear the beep, then -- \nTALLEY (into his phone) Jane?  If you're there, pick up, okay? Mandy? \nNo one answers.  Talley closes his phone, his apprehension increasing -- \nEXT. YORK ESTATES FRONT GATE -- NIGHT \nThe Bristo officers manning the gate swing the blockade aside and wave Talley through -- \nEXT. MEDIA AREA -- NIGHT \nThe assembled television microwave vans, radio newsvans, and reporters are parked together in an empty lot one block from the front gate. \nKen Seymore steps into the street, speaking into a cell phone as he watches Talley drive away -- \nSEYMORE (into his phone) He's leaving now. \nEXT. RED LIGHT INTERSECTION -- DAY \nA traffic light on the outskirts of town, deserted until Talley's car pulls to a stop -- \nINT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT \nSuddenly, two masked men point guns at his head, one from the driver's side, one from the passengers.  They're wearing jackets, black ski masks, and gloves.  The man on the passenger side sports a big gold Rolex, so we'll call him the Watchman -- \nTHE WATCHMAN (meaning the gun) Do you see the fuckin' gun?!  Look at it! \nTalley freezes.  He's been blindsided by this insane shit, but he knows better than to move -- \nTALLEY Take it easy. \nThe man on the driver's side gets into the backseat, then the Watchman gets into the passenger side.  The man behind Talley hooks an arm around Talley's throat while the Watchman searches for Talley's gun -- \nTHE WATCHMAN Where's your gun? \nTALLEY I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it. \nThe Watchman nods at the backseater, who releases Talley. \nA dark green Mustang roars up ahead of Talley's car.  A second car tucks in tight on Talley's rear -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) Who are you? \nTalley clips the gun to his belt under his sweatshirt.  He's ready to rock.  The camera finds the photograph of Talley during his days as a SWAT tactical officer -- \nHe was one bad motherfucker. \nINT. THE MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT \nTalley heads for the front door -- \nTALLEY I'm going back to York.  Have Larry meet me at the front gate. \nTalley exits without a backward glance -- \nEXT. YORK ESTATES FRONT GATE -- NIGHT \nThe helicopters orbit in the distance; the empty lot with the news vans is in the background. \nTalley turns into the development, then stops at the side of the street where Larry Anders is waiting -- \nINT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT \nAnders slides into the passenger seat.  He sees a different Talley now, focused and grim -- \nANDERS What's up, Chief? \nTalley stares at Anders, trying to decide:  Can I trust him? Will he rat me out to the Watchman and cost the lives of my wife and child? \nANDERS (CONT'D) Did I do something wrong? \nTalley gives him a slip of paper -- \nTALLEY I want you to run this license plate and phone number.  Then I want you to find out everything you can about Walter Smith. ANDERS The guy in the house? \nTALLEY Go back to the office.  Run his name through the FBI and the NLETS database. I think he's involved with illegal activity or he associates with people who are. \nAnders glances at the slip again, then tucks it away -- \nANDERS Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief. \nTALLEY Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry? \nANDERS I guess so. \nTALLEY Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut. \nANDERS I will, Chief.  Absolutely. \nTALLEY Get to work. \nAnders climbs out and Talley rockets away -- \nEXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT \nTalley pulls up behind the Sheriffs' command van.  Martin, surprised to see Talley, steps from the van -- \nTALLEY I'm re-assuming command of the scene. \nMartin is surprised and angry -- \nMARTIN Excuse me?  You requested our help.  You turned over command -- \nTALLEY And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house. \nTalley heads for the cul-de-sac -- \nINT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nJennifer is on her bed in the darkness, groggy with fear and fatigue.  She hears someone outside in the hall -- \nJENNIFER Thomas? \nThe door knob rattles.  Jennifer slides out of bed and goes to the door -- \nJENNIFER (CONT'D) Thomas, is that you? \nThe door suddenly opens, and Mars is framed in the dim light. Jennifer jumps back, terrified -- \nJENNIFER (CONT'D) What do you want? \nMARS We can't make the microwave work. \nThat seems so outlandish that Jennifer is confused -- \nJENNIFER What? \nMARS We're hungry.  You're going to cook. \nMars grabs her hair, and pushes her out the door -- \nINT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nMars shoves Jennifer into the kitchen.  Two frozen pizzas are waiting on the counter -- \nMARS Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine. \nMobile banks of flood lamps illuminate the front of the house.  The ambulance waits behind the lights; tactical officers with M5s and M16s hunker in position in case the program goes south -- \nTalley and a paramedic named Bigelow emerge between the lights, wearing only shorts and shoes.  Bigelow is carrying a collapsable stretcher -- \nThey stop in the mouth of the drive with a full view of the front door.  Talley lifts his cell phone -- \nTALLEY (into the phone) Okay, Dennis, we won't approach the house until you've closed the door. \nThe front door opens, a crack at first, then wider.  The line of officers behind the lights shifts -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) (over his shoulder) Easy.... \nKevin and Mars waddle out with Walter Smith between them. They put him down about six feet from the front door, then return to the house -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) (to Bigelow) Let's do it. \nTalley and Bigelow move forward.  When they reach Walter, Bigelow opens the stretcher and locks out the frame.  He peels back Walter's eyelids and flashes a penlight -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) How's he look? \nBIGELOW He's got a concussion for sure.  I'm going to brace him. \nAs Bigelow sets a cervical neck brace, Talley gets the creepy feeling that he's being watched.  He turns toward the shutters, and finds a pair of eyes only inches from his own. It's Mars. \nTalley stares at Mars, and Mars stares back.  It's as if they're locked in a contest of wills until -- \nBIGELOW (CONT'D) Let's get him on the stretcher. \nTalley turns away to help Bigelow -- \nBIGELOW (CONT'D) I'll support his head and shoulders.  You lift his hips and knees.  On three. Three. \nAs they carry Walter away, Talley glances back at the eyes. Mars is still watching him -- \nIN THE CUL-DE-SAC--TALLEY AND BIGELOW \nare surrounded by cops as soon as they step into the shadows behind the lights.  Another paramedic takes the stretcher from Talley.  Maddox is waiting with Talley's clothes -- \nMADDOX You ready to tell me what's going on? \nTalley pulls on his pants -- \nTALLEY No. \nTalley stalks straight to the ambulance, pulling on his sweatshirt as he goes -- \nINT. THE AMBULANCE -- NIGHT \nA young physician named Klaus is examining Walter as Talley steps up into the ambulance -- \nTALLEY I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him. \nKLAUS Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both. \nTalley ignores the doctor and shakes Walter by the face -- \nTALLEY Smith!  Wake up! \nKLAUS What are you doing?!  Stop that! \nWalter's eyes flutter, one more open than the other.  Talley leans closer -- \nTALLEY (to Smith) Wake up, goddamnit.  Who are you? \nKlaus tries to shove Talley away, but it's like pushing a wall -- \nKLAUS This man needs a hospital!  Stop it! \nTalley grabs Klaus by the arm, trying to make him see -- \nTALLEY Use smelling salts, give him a shot, whatever.  I just need a minute. \nBigelow climbs behind the wheel and starts the ambulance. Talley pounds on the wall, shouting -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) Stop the fuckin' engine! \nKlaus and Bigelow are both staring at Talley.  Sheriffs and Talley's own officers have gathered at the open rear of the ambulance to see what all the shouting is about -- \nKlaus pointedly looks at Talley's hand gripping his arm.  He speaks slowly, trying to make Talley understand -- \nKLAUS I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can. \nTALLEY Just one question.  Please. \nKLAUS He.  Can't.  Answer. \nTalley stares at Walter Smith.  So close.  So damned close. Walter knows about the disks.  Walter might even know who has Jane and Amanda.  But now Walter can't talk -- \nTalley turns away and climbs out of the ambulance -- \nEXT. THE CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT \nAs Talley emerges from the van, he pulls Metzger aside -- \nTALLEY I thought they locked you in your room. \nTHOMAS I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house. \nTALLEY Can you get into the office? \nTHOMAS I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall. \nTalley thinks about what the boy is saying, and what he'll have to do to get Marlon and Al -- \nTALLEY If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught? \nTHOMAS Yes, sir. \nTalley glances toward the SWAT Command Van as he comes up with a plan -- \nEXT. THE COMMAND VAN -- NIGHT \nMartin, Maddox, and several of her supervisors are gathered outside the van as Talley approaches -- \nMartin sees him coming and steps away to meet him.  She's pissed off and she wants answers -- \nMARTIN I want to know what in hell you're doing. \nTALLEY I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit. \nMARTIN I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out -- \nTALLEY (interrupting) Don't question me, Captain!  This is my crime scene! \nMARTIN (shouting over him) -- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  What is going on? \nTalley glares at her, half-a-heartbeat from going off, and then he throttles back -- \nTALLEY (simply) I'm a negotiator, Captain.  I negotiate. That's all you need to know.  Now are you going to help me or not? \nMartin weighs the determination in his eyes.  She's angry, she's resentful, and she wants to knock Talley onto his ass-- but, instead, she glances back to her van -- \nMARTIN Maddox!  Let's give the man a hand! \nINT. SMITHS' DEN -- NIGHT \nDennis steps through the double doors that open from the entry and admires the room--rich paneled walls, soft leather couches and chairs, and a lush beaten-copper bar.  Walter Smith's office is directly across the hall. \nDennis saunters behind the bar, letting his fingers play over the copper, then pours a stiff Ketel One on the rocks. \nKevin appears behind him, watching, as Dennis takes a seat on one of the leather bar stools, then peels a hundred off a thick roll and drops it on the bar -- \nDENNIS (to an imaginary bartender) Keep the change, m'man. \nDennis takes a deep drink of the vodka as Kevin approaches -- \nKEVIN We're fucked. \nDENNIS We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich. \nKEVIN There is no way out. \nDENNIS For chrissake, please!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out! \nKEVIN Celebrate what?  Going to prison? \nDennis enjoys another stiff belt -- \nDENNIS No, dumbass--Talley.  Talley's the guy who keeps us in here, and Talley's the guy who can let us out. \nDennis grins as if he's discovered the wisdom of the ages -- \nDENNIS (CONT'D) Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share. (leans closer and lowers his voice) And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars. \nMARS Dennis. \nMars is standing in the doors, large and ominous.  For an insane moment Dennis thinks that Mars has heard, but then -- \nMARS (CONT'D) The food's ready. \nDennis grins, then shoves Kevin out of the room ahead of him, the three of them disappearing toward the kitchen as -- \nThe camera drifts up to an air vent in the ceiling, through the slats in the grate to -- \nINT. CRAWLSPACE -- NIGHT \nThomas watches them leave through a hole in the air duct. When he's confident that they are gone, he continues along the crawlspace to a service hatch that opens down into -- \nINT. WINE CELLAR - NIGHT \nThe \"wine cellar\" is a climate-controlled closet behind the bar fitted with floor-to-ceiling wine racks. \nThe ceiling hatch lifts, and Thomas climbs down the racks to the floor.  He eases open the door and peeks out behind the bar.  The den is bright with light, and empty -- \nThomas lifts his cell phone -- \nTHOMAS (whispers into the phone) It's me, Chief.  I'm in the den. \nDENNIS Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life? \nTALLEY I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could. \nDENNIS Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something? \nDennis Rooney steps closer because he doesn't want anyone else to see the wad of money he pulls out -- \nDENNIS (CONT'D) That's fifty hundred-dollar bills.  Five grand.  They got money in this house, Talley, more than you've ever seen. \nDennis pushes the money back into his pocket. \nDENNIS (CONT'D) How much would it be worth to you, getting me out of here? \nSo that's what keeps Dennis in the house--money.  This is the first that Talley has heard of the money -- \nTALLEY You picked a bad house to hole up in, son. \nDENNIS Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know. \nTALLEY Give up. \nDENNIS There's a million dollars in there, maybe two million.  I'll give you half. \nTalley stares at Dennis, wondering how much to tell him and whether or not it will do any good -- \nTALLEY The man you sent to the hospital is a criminal.  He has partners.  This is their house and their money and they want it back. \nThese simple facts settle on Dennis like a funeral shroud-- everything that Smith said earlier now makes a horrible sense:  You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get. \nDennis's eyes fill with defeat and helplessness -- \nDENNIS It ain't been a good day, Chief. \nTALLEY Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life. \nDennis steps inside and pulls the door closed, the darkness in the house swallowing him like dirty water. \nThe power is turned on.  The house comes to life -- \nAs Talley turns away, his phone once more rings -- \nINT. THOMAS' ROOM -- NIGHT \nThomas is hunkered with his computer behind his bed so that the camera can't see him. \nTHOMAS I got'm! \nIntercut Talley, now back in the cul-de-sac -- \nTALLEY Can you open them? \nTHOMAS I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes. \nTALLEY Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are? \nThomas scrolls through a spread sheet -- \nTHOMAS I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses. \nTALLEY Try Al.  See if you can open Al. \nThomas changes disks and opens Al -- \nTHOMAS Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax -- \nTALLEY Who is it? \nTHOMAS Charles G. Benza. (then; noise in the hall) They're coming! \nThomas abruptly hangs up and the line goes dead in Talley's ear. \nTalley recognizes the name as easily as an East Coast cop would recognize John Gotti, and realizes the stunning import of Smith possessing Sonny Benza's financial records -- \nTALLEY Sonny Benza.  Oh, fuck. \nTalley sprints across the cul-de-sac to his nearest officer, Jorgenson, and keys Jorgenson's shoulder mike -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) (into the mike) Leigh?  Metzger, answer me! \nMETZGER'S VOICE I'm at the hospital. \nTALLEY Put a guard on Smith!  I want you with Smith until I get there! \nJORGENSON What's going on? \nTALLEY Get in the car.  Now. \nTalley drops the mike and shoves Jorgenson toward the car -- \nEXT. CANYON COUNTRY HOSPITAL -- NIGHT \nMarion Clewes is stepping from his car as Talley's police unit rips into the parking lot with flashing lights -- \nTHE WATCHMAN'S VOICE We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A. \nTALLEY What do you mean by that? \nTHE WATCHMAN'S VOICE You don't want another dead child on your conscience. \nThe line goes dead -- \nINT. THE SMITHS' DEN -- NIGHT \nDennis is pouring another stiff glass of Ketel One -- \nDENNIS I shouldn't have told him about the money.  Now Talley is gonna keep it for himself. \nKevin joins him at the bar.  Mars is by the doors -- \nKEVIN He said that? \nDennis downs a big hit of vodka, then moves to the couch -- \nDENNIS If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive. \nKEVIN What are you talking about? \nDENNIS The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now. \nKEVIN That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us. \nDENNIS Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid... \nKevin follows his brother to the couch and stares at him; Dennis has clearly lost his mind, and Kevin has reached the end of his rope -- \nKEVIN It's over.  We have to give up. \nDENNIS Fuck it's over.  That money's mine. \nKEVIN That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed! \nDennis tips his glass, like a toast -- \nDENNIS Then we might as well die rich. \nKEVIN I'm not going to die for this! \nKevin slaps the glass away.  Dennis boils up from the couch. He grabs his brother and the two of them fall over the coffee table, Dennis hammering Kevin in a furious rage until he runs out of gas -- \nDENNIS You're my fuckin' anchor, Kevin, the fuckin' lead around my life that I've been draggin' like a cripple leg! \nDennis gets up and steps back -- \nDENNIS (CONT'D) Get this into your stupid head, Kevin. We're not leaving without the money. \nBeaten and whimpering, Kevin crawls away.  Dennis watches him crawl out of the room, then looks at Mars -- \nDENNIS (CONT'D) You got something to say? \nMARS I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave. \nDENNIS Fuckin' A. \nDennis returns to the bar.  When he looks around again, Mars is gone--melted into the darkness. \nINT. JENNIFER'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nJennifer is hiding in her shadows when her doorknob moves.  She reaches pulls the knife from her shorts, keeping it hidden as she backs away -- \nKevin steps inside, leaving the door ajar -- \nJENNIFER What do you want? \nKEVIN Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here. \nJennifer now sees the marks and cuts on his face -- \nJENNIFER What happened? \nKEVIN Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here. \nJENNIFER I can't go without Thomas. \nKEVIN All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this. \nJENNIFER How can we get out? \nKEVIN Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand? \nJENNIFER Yes. \nKevin goes back to the door, then considers her.  Maybe he wants to apologize for all this, but the best he can manage is -- \nKEVIN Put on some shoes. \nKevin slips out and pulls the door closed. \nDREYER Krupchek lives in a shithole. \nThe trailer is dark and silent.  They walk to the door carrying their Maglites.  Mikkelson tries the knob -- \nMIKKELSON I guess we could jimmy it. \nDREYER I don't want to pay for breaking it. \nMikkelson pulls hard and the door pops open.  Both officers cringe as a smell like simmering mustard greens rolls out at them -- \nMIKKELSON Christ, that stinks. \nINT. THE TRAILER -- NIGHT \nMikkelson switches on the lights as they step inside.  Dreyer sees it first -- \nDREYER Mickey?  Look at this shit. \nMikkelson joins Dreyer in the trailer's tiny kitchen where teetering stacks of folded cereal boxes fill the counters and sink and floor.  Hundreds and hundreds of Captain Crunch and Count Chocula boxes, all neatly folded and stacked -- \nDREYER (CONT'D) He's burned them. \nMIKKELSON What? \nDreyer shows her a box.  The nose of each character has been burned with a cigarette -- \nDREYER He burned their noses. \nMIKKELSON Okay, this is creeping me out. \nMikkelson opens the oven.  It's empty.  She opens a cupboard. It's filled with large glass jars.  She opens another cupboard.  More jars.  Shapes float in the jars, suspended in yellow fluid.  Mikkelson and Dreyer examine the shapes -- \nDREYER What are those, rats? \nMikkelson opens the fridge, then slams it, looking like she wants to puke -- \nMIKKELSON Ohmigod.  We gotta call Talley. \nDreyer sees the expression on her face, then looks at the fridge, wondering -- \nEXT. CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT \nTalley, Jones, and Jones's phony \"FBI\" team are moving down the cul-de-sac toward the house with Martin at their heels -- \nMR. JONES Walter Smith is in the Federal Witness Protection program.  When Washington learned about the situation here, they asked Chief Talley for his cooperation. \nMARTIN This is bullshit.  I should've been notified. \nMR. JONES I'm sure you will be, Captain, but it's after midnight.  Now, if you'll pull your people off the perimeter, I want to get my people in position. \nMartin looks like she wants to spit bullets -- \nTALLEY Let it go, Captain. \nMARTIN Goddamned small town bullshit. \nMartin relents and stalks away just as Talley's phone rings. \nBoth Talley and Jones tense at the ring, thinking it might be the white phone, but it's not -- \nTALLEY It's mine. (into his phone) Talley. \nMIKKELSON'S VOICE Chief, it's Mikkelson. \nTALLEY Go, Mickey. \nEXT. KRUPCHEK'S TRAILER -- NIGHT \nBoth Mikkelson and Dreyer are leaning against their car. They look shellshocked.  Mikkelson is making the call -- \nMIKKELSON Chief, we just found Krupchek's trailer. We just went in there. \nShe trails off and looks at Dreyer for help:  How do I say this?  Dreyer, at a loss, looks away -- \nMIKKELSON (CONT'D) He has human body parts in his refrigerator.  He has five human heads. \nMikkelson can't handle it any more.  She lowers the phone -- \nWITH TALLEY \nThe shock that Mikkelson is feeling sweeps over Talley as well.  He takes a moment to get his head around this -- \nTALLEY (into his phone) Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait. \nMIKKELSON'S VOICE Yes, sir. \nTalley lowers the phone as he stares at the house, wondering what sort of monster is in there with Thomas and Jennifer. \nHis gaze shifts to Mr. Jones, who is watching him -- \nTALLEY We're getting those kids out of there. \nINT. THE SMITHS' DEN -- NIGHT \nHe raises the knife to her face -- \nINT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nThe scream from the laundry room having scared the shit out of Dennis, he has his gun out -- \nDENNIS Who's that?  Goddamnit, who's there? \nDennis turns on his flashlight and sweeps the beam across the kitchen -- \nDENNIS (CONT'D) Kev?  Is that you?  Talley? \nDennis weaves across the kitchen, pushing the gun ahead of him -- \nDENNIS (CONT'D) Kevin, if that's you, say something. Mars said you left. \nDennis steps through the door into -- \nINT. THE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT \nDennis shines the light on the floor and sees the red ooze. He follows the blood to Kevin's body, but even then doesn't realize what he's seeing -- \nDENNIS Kevin, what the fuck?  Get up. \nDennis steps closer, and now he sees the open neck, the grotesque white bone within the flesh -- \nOnly one other person in the house could have done this -- \nDENNIS (CONT'D) MARS?!?! \nDennis hears Jennifer screaming upstairs -- \nDENNIS (CONT'D) MARS!!! \nDennis rushes from the room -- \nINT. JENNIFER'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nDennis slams through the door so heard that the door crashes into the wall.  Mars is across the room, still holding Jennifer by the neck -- \nDennis aims his gun -- \nDENNIS You're dead, you fuck. \nMars calmly pulls the girl in front of him, blocking Dennis's aim. \nMARS What's wrong, Dennis?  Why're you so pissed off? \nIt's weird the way Mars is acting, so calm and all.  But Dennis can see the feat in Jennifer's face and her swollen eyes.  She manages one word -- \nJENNIFER Please... \nDennis tries to aim past her -- \nDENNIS This fuck killed Kevin.  There's blood everywhere down there -- \nJennifer sobs.  And when she does -- \nMars charges across the room holding Jennifer like a shield. Dennis hesitates only a heartbeat, and then it's too late -- \nJennifer crashes into him, the full force of Mars's weight behind her, knocking Dennis backward into the hall -- \nINT. SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT \nThey fall through the door into a tangle on the floor.  Mars raises the hammer, then brings it down, smashing Dennis over and over -- \nINT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nThomas emerges from the closet to see the carnage in the hall:  Mars over Dennis, grunting like a pig as he turns Dennis into pulp, and Jennifer crawling away, splattered with blood -- \nThomas pulls the gun from his pants and darts past Mars into the hall -- \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT \nThomas grabs Jennifer's arm and pulls her toward the stairs -- \nTHOMAS C'mon, Jen!  Run! \nMars heaves to his feet and turns after them -- \nThomas jerks up the pistol with both hands -- \nTHOMAS (CONT'D) I'll shoot you! \nMars stops, blood dripping from his face and hands and the hammer.  Jennifer pulls her brother -- \nJENNIFER Keep going! \nThey back toward the stairs, Thomas trying to hold the gun steady.  Mars follows, spreading his arms wide as if to embrace them -- \nMARS Everyone's gone.  We can do whatever we want.  We can do anything. \nTHOMAS I'll shoot you!  I'm not kidding, you better stay away! \nTalley and Jones slip up to a side window at the front of the house.  Both are carrying fire extinguishers.  They peer inside, then Jones uses a pry bar to lift the window -- \nINT. FRONT GUEST ROOM -- NIGHT \nTalley enters first, followed by Jones.  The air is thick with smoke, and the music is confusing; the hall outside the room is filled with flames -- \nTalley points toward the bedroom, then uses hand signals to countdown the launch--three...two...one -- \nJones keys his throat mike to launch the strike -- \nMR. JONES Go -- \nThey blast the flames with their fire extinguishers, then plunge into the hall -- \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nThe sliding glass doors shatter as one of Jones's men breaches the door.  As he rolls to his feet, Mars shoots him from the flames -- \nA second man rolls through the door, and Mars shoots again, laughing as the man writhes in flames -- \nINT. HALL -- TALLEY AND JONES \nfight back the flames with their fire extinguishers, working their way into -- \nINT. THE MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nIt's an inferno as Talley and Jones come through the door. They spot the two men on the floor just as -- \nMars rears up behind the flames.  He is shirtless and glistening, screaming maniacally is he fires his gun -- \nTalley and Jones fire in unison, pounding Mars with bullets and knocking him into the fire.  Mars thrashes and screams, burning alive -- \nTalley hears pounding inside the safe room:  Jennifer and Thomas!  He fights his way to the security door, which is covered with flames -- \nTALLEY The kids are in here! \nMR. JONES Where's the office? \nTALLEY Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later! \nTalley expects that Jones will help, but Jones is aiming his gun -- \nMR. JONES We don't need you any more, Chief.  We can get the disks on our own. \nBut before Jones can kill Talley, Mars heaves himself up from the flames, firing wildly.  He hits Jones in the head -- \nTalley fires reflexively, his powerful .45 kicking Mars across the room and out the glass doors.  Talley turns back to the burning door and douses the flames with his fire extinguisher -- \nTALLEY Thomas!  Thomas, it's me! \nThomas and Jennifer jerk open the door, but shrink from the heat.  Talley uses the last of his fire extinguisher, then pulls them into his arms -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) Stay close.  We're going to move fast -- \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT \nTalley shepherds Jennifer and Thomas past the flames -- \nINT. THE ENTRY -- NIGHT \nThey reach the entry, and Talley uses his pry bar to break open the door -- \nA wall of cops are out on the street, waiting -- \nTALLEY (to Thomas) Are the disks still in your room? \nTHOMAS No!  They're right here -- \nThomas pulls Marlon and Al from his pocket -- \nTalley clutches the disks and pulls the boy close in a spontaneous hug.  They run out the door as we -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. WALTER SMITH'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT \nWalter is resting comfortably when Talley steps up beside his bed.  Talley is a mess--smokey, dirty, greased with sweat -- \nTALLEY (quietly) Smith. \nWalter opens his eyes, then Talley steps away.  Jennifer and Thomas are standing behind him.  They rush to their father -- \nJENNIFER/THOMAS Daddy! \nWALTER Thank God!  Are you guys all right? You're not hurt? \nTHOMAS Our house is on fire!  We almost burned! \nBoth children burst into tears, and Walter hugs them.  He looks up at Talley, then gently eases his kids away -- \nWALTER (to Jennifer and Thomas) You guys step out for a second.  I have to talk to the Chief. \nWalter waits until his children are gone, and then -- \n", "test1_input": "TALLEY Have still prints made from the tape. Show the landlord.  Maybe we can get a fast ID. \nTalley looks closer.  With the way Mars is positioned, we can see part of the tattoo on his head -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) Here on his head.  Is that a tattoo? \nMIKKELSON I can't make it out. \nTALLEY Says...burn it. \nOn the tape, Kim slumps to the floor.  Dennis vaults across the counter and runs to the door.  Mars, however, calmly picks up Kim's gun and leans across the counter.  We couldn't see this before, but now we see a strange smile play over his face -- \nDREYER What's he doing? \nTALLEY He's watching Kim die. \nTalley watches Mars, and knows that this guy is seriously disturbed.  He is still watching the tape when Leigh Metzger calls from the door -- \nMETZGER Chief? \nTalley turns.  Metzger is with Amanda and Jane -- \nEXT. MRS. PENA'S HOUSE -- DAY \nTalley, Jane, and Amanda are walking to the street.  Amanda is excited; she thinks this is cool -- \nAMANDA Are men with guns really barricaded in a house? \nTALLEY Just around the corner and up that street.  See the helicopters? \nFive news choppers now hover high over the house.  The crime scene is only two blocks away.  Close. \nJANE Wait by the car, Mandy.  Give me a minute with Dad. \nThey wait until Amanda is gone, then -- \nTALLEY (apologizing) I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast -- \nJANE Don't worry about it.  How are you doing? \nTALLEY The Sheriffs will take over when they get here. \nJANE But they're not here yet.  Tell me about you. \nJane touches his arm -- \nJANE (CONT'D) Jesus, you're shaking. \nSelf-conscious, Talley moves away so that he's out of reach -- \nTALLEY Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can. \nJANE You sure? \nTALLEY I don't know how long I'll be stuck here. \nJANE I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk. \nTalley gives her a gentle nod, then watches her walk away until -- \nTALLEY Jane? \nShe turns back, her eyes asking 'what?' \nTALLEY (CONT'D) I'm scared shitless. \nJANE That's okay.  I love you anyway. \nTalley and Jane share the moment, and then she walks away. \nEXT. YORK ESTATES -- DAY \nA news chopper swings by overhead bringing us to the main entrance of York Estates.  The entrance has been blocked, and cars are being turned away, so traffic is backed up both ways along the street -- \nINT. GLEN HOWELL'S CAR -- DAY \nGlen Howell is a nice-looking man in his early forties: Sport coat, gold Rolex, deep tan.  He hammers the horn of his Mercedes S600 sedan, but it does no good; traffic is frozen -- \nA news van trying to work up the line pulls alongside, then gets jammed by the crunch like everyone else.  Howell rolls down the window -- \nHOWELL Hey, you guys know what's going on? \nAn attractive Asian-American reporter leans from her window to answer -- \nREPORTER Three men took a family hostage. \nHOWELL Jesus, no shit?  My client lives in there. \nThe reporter checks her notes -- \nREPORTER It's a family named Smith, Walter and Pamela Smith.  Do you know them? \nHowell stares at her emptily, then shakes his head -- \n", "test1_true": "Howell pulls a U-turn to get out of traffic.  He flips open his cell phone and presses the speed dial -- \nHOWELL (CONT'D) (into his phone) We have a problem out here. \nINT. SONNY BENZA'S OFFICE -- PALM SPRINGS -- DAY \nWe're in a palatial home on the ridge overlooking Palm Springs.  On the cut, Sonny Benza, Phil Tuzee, and Charlie Fischer are watching TV news coverage of the situation in Bristo Camino -- \nTUZEE Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go. \nBENZA Maybe Glen already picked up the disks. \nTUZEE I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house. \nFischer tries being positive -- \nFISCHER Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house? \nBENZA You think we should take that chance? \nFISCHER (on the spot) I guess not. \nBENZA I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house? \nTUZEE Smith was cooking the books for the IRS. That means he has it all:  The cash flow, where it comes from, how we launder it, our split with the East. \nFISCHER It's on two computer disks he calls Marlon and Al. \nBENZA What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor? \nFISCHER If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know. \nBENZA No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there. \nTUZEE You should warn them, Sonny. \nBENZA Fuck them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this. \nBenza turns back to the television -- \nBENZA (CONT'D) Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids. \nTUZEE He knows better than that. \nBENZA Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  Who's running the show up there? \nFISCHER They have a chief of police, a guy named Talley.  I saw him being interviewed. \nThe television suddenly shows Talley making a statement.  He looks tired and haggard -- \nFISCHER (pointing) Hey, that's him.  That's Talley right there! \nBenza studies Talley, then looks at his lieutenants -- \nBENZA Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him. \nTUZEE It's happening right now. \nThat's exactly what Benza wanted to hear. \nEXT. THE DESERT ROSE MOTEL -- DAY \nA low-rent motel on the road between Bristo Camino and Newhall.  Glen Howell's Mercedes is parked on the side, along with several other cars. \nIt's late-afternoon going into evening.  The sun is sinking fast -- \nINT. HOWELL'S ROOM -- DAY \nHowell is being briefed by his operators, four men and two women.  There's a minimum of bullshit; these people are professionals -- \nKen Seymore is an intense, compact man who talks fast -- \nSEYMORE L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera. \nHOWELL Give me an ETA. \nSEYMORE An hour, tops.  Might be sooner. \nDuane Manelli speaks up -- \nMANELLI When the Sheriffs get here, how many we looking at? \nSEYMORE (checking his notes) A command team, a negotiating team, a tactical team--the tac team includes a perimeter team, the assault team, snipers, and breachers--thirty-five new bodies. \nHOWELL How many locals? \nGayle Devarona, one of the women, leans forward -- \nDEVARONA Fourteen officers and two civilians.  I have their names and most of their addresses. \nShe tosses a yellow legal pad onto the table -- \nHOWELL And Talley? \n", "test1_id": 1827, "test2_input": "Kevin is anything but thrilled -- \nKEVIN Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide. \nDENNIS Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants. \nAcross the room, Walter Smith shudders and moans; his face is swollen and covered with clammy sweat -- \nJennifer is sick with worry and can't stand seeing her father like this -- \nJENNIFER My father needs a doctor.  Please. \nDENNIS Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed. \nJENNIFER All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  Look at him. \nDENNIS Use more ice. \nJENNIFER I'm getting a doctor! \nJennifer lurches to her feet and runs toward the front door. Dennis catches her in two steps and backhands her exactly the way his old man used to smack his old lady, knocking her to the floor -- \nTHOMAS Jen!!! \nThomas charges into Dennis like an angry midget.  Kevin jumps between them -- \nKEVIN Stop it!  Stop it, Dennis!  Jesus! \nMars steps forward and jerks Thomas into the air.  Mars' physical presence is suddenly so imposing that everyone stops fighting -- \nMARS (quietly) We should tie them.  We can put them upstairs out of the way. \nIt takes Dennis a moment to come up to speed with that, but then he nods -- \nDENNIS That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars. \nMARS (to Kevin) Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight. \nDENNIS Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there. (waves at Walter) And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us. \nMars nods his approval.  Subtly, there is the beginning of a shift in power -- \nINT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nMars pushes Jennifer inside.  Kevin follows her with duct tape and a couple of extension cords.  Mars, holding Thomas, pauses in the hall -- \nMARS Tie her to the chair.  I'll take care of the windows when I finish with the boy. \nMars disappears with Thomas down the hall.  Jennifer stands by the chair, arms once more crossed over her breasts. Kevin can see that she's scared.  He takes a T-shirt from where she's left it on the floor and hands it to her -- \nKEVIN Here.  Put this on. \nShe pulls it over her head -- \nKEVIN (CONT'D) You gotta pee? \nJENNIFER I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere. \nKEVIN Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want? \nJennifer sits.  Kevin pulls her hands behind the back of the chair.  As he ties her, Jennifer decides that if any of them can be reached, it's Kevin -- \nJENNIFER Thanks for the shirt. \nKEVIN Whatever. \nJENNIFER Kevin, my father needs a doctor. \nKEVIN He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out. \nJENNIFER If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that? \nKevin leans back.  He knows she's right, but he doesn't believe he can do anything about it -- \nKEVIN I can't make Dennis see anything. \nA shadow moves behind Kevin.  It's Mars, standing in the door.  He holds up a wicked claw hammer -- \nMARS Look what I found. \nHe enters and tests at Jennifer's binds -- \nMARS (CONT'D) You tied her like a pussy.  Make it tight. \nAs Kevin reties the bindings, Mars rips the phone from the wall.  He smashes the phone jack with the hammer, crushing it.  Then he goes to the window and drives a heavy nail into the sill, nailing the window closed -- \nMars returns to Jennifer and once more checks her binds -- \nMARS (CONT'D) Better. \nHe tears off a strip of duct tape and presses it over her mouth -- \nKEVIN Make sure she can breathe. \n", "test2_true": "MARS Go downstairs, Kevin. \nJennifer looks at Kevin, her eyes pleading that he not leave, but Kevin is cowed; he leaves -- \nJennifer looks back at Mars -- \nMars leans close to her.  She is terrified that he is going to kiss her, but, instead, he sniffs, smelling her -- \nMARS (CONT'D) I want to show you something. \nMars hooks the claw hammer under his shirt and lifts to expose his chest.  A large tattoo in flowing script is lined across his body:  A Mother's Son. \nMARS (CONT'D) It cost two hundred forty dollars, but I was happy to spend it.  I love my mom. You see these? \nMars points out hard gray knots that speckle his chest as if he were diseased.  He fingers the lumps sensuously as if touching them excites him -- \nMARS (CONT'D) My mom burned me with cigarettes. \nJennifer is both disgusted and terrified.  Mars stares at her emptily for another moment, then lowers his shirt and leaves without another word. \nINT. THOMAS'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nThe room is dark.  Thomas is tied firmly to the bed.  The cords cut into Thomas's wrists and Thomas can't reach the knots, but Mars made one mistake:  He tied Thomas to the headboard posts, and one of the newels has been loose for years -- \nThomas stretches against the ropes to reach the newel, then twists it back and forth.  He works it harder and harder until the newel slides off its pin, and suddenly his hand is free, though still tied to the newel -- \nThomas peels the tape from his mouth, then unties the remaining binds and frees himself from the newel.  He slips off his bed and crawls along the wall to his closet -- \nINT. THOMAS'S CLOSET -- NIGHT \nA service hatch that opens into the attic crawlspace is built into the wall beneath Thomas's clothes.  Thomas prys open the hatch, then reaches inside for a small flashlight.  He flicks it on, then climbs into the eaves of the roof -- \nINT. CRAWLSPACE -- NIGHT \nThe crawlspace is a long triangular tunnel that follows the edge of the roof.  It was built for plumbers and air conditioning technicians, but Thomas has taken the space for his own:  Witness the stack of Penthouse, pictures of sports heroes tacked to the rafters, and old soda cans strewn between the joists -- \nThomas scurries quietly through the tunnel, heading for -- \nINT. JENNIFER'S CLOSET -- NIGHT \nThomas pushes through a hatch identical to the one in his own closet, then creeps to the door -- \nTHOMAS (whispers) Jen! \nINT. JENNIFER'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nJennifer twists around to see him, mumbling through the tape -- \nTHOMAS Sit still!  If they're in the security room, they can see you on the monitors. \nJennifer quiets.  Thomas slips out of the closet and creeps toward her along the wall -- \nTHOMAS (CONT'D) I figured out what these cameras can see last year when Mom and Dad went to Lake Arrowhead.  It can't see me over here, but it's looking at you, so don't move! \nThomas reaches up from behind Jennifer and jerks the tape off her mouth -- \nJENNIFER Ow!  Shit! \nTHOMAS Be quiet!  Listen! \nThomas is hiding behind Jennifer so that the camera cannot see him -- \nJENNIFER No one's coming. \nTHOMAS That big asshole nailed my windows. \nJENNIFER Mine, too. \nTHOMAS We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it. \nJENNIFER No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them! \nThomas thinks about that and decides that he can't leave their father, either -- \nTHOMAS We can't carry him. \nJENNIFER You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy. \nTHOMAS I'm not gonna leave you! \nJENNIFER Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police! \nThomas suddenly realizes what he has to do -- \nTHOMAS We'll all go, Jennifer.  All of us or none of us.  I know where Daddy keeps a gun. \nJennifer jerks so hard that she almost tips over the chair -- \nJENNIFER (loud) You leave that gun alone! \nTHOMAS Shh, they'll hear you! \nJENNIFER (louder) Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says -- \n", "test2_id": 1828, "test3_input": "is hiding in weeds across from the motel, keeping an eye on the road for Talley's approaching vehicle.  A radio transmission crackles quietly -- \nMANELLI'S VOICE You see anything? \nRuiz keys the mike -- \nRUIZ Not yet. \nTalley steps silently behind him and presses his gun to Mike Ruiz's ear -- \nLOU BUSTER \nBuster is on the dark side of thge parking lot, standing watch outside the pool of light in the shadows -- \nGravel crunches behind him; Buster turns, and -- \nTalley cracks him across the face with his .45 -- \nWITH TALLEY \nHe edges along the perimeter of the parking lot, working as close as he can to a Fat Man who is leaning against the green Mustang -- \nThe door to a ground floor room opens, and Glen Howell steps out.  Talley recognizes Howell from the big gold watch -- \nHOWELL (to the Fat Man) Keep your eyes open.  He should've been here. \nHowell returns to the room.  The Fat Man steps away from the Mustang, and -- \nTalley slams into his blindside, using the .45 as a club. The Fat Man staggers, and Talley wraps an arm around his neck in a choke hold, running him at the door -- \nTalley rams the Fat man into the door, knocking it open and shoving the Fat Man through -- \nINT. HOWELL'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT \nTalley explodes through the door with the Fat Man in front of him like a shield -- \nTALLEY (screaming) Police! \nGlen Howell jerks out his pistol as he drops behind the bed. Duane Manelli rolls out of a chair, aiming from the floor in a two-handed grip -- \nHOWELL Don't shoot!  Don't shoot him! \nTalley shifts his aim back and forth between the two men.  He has his back to the wall and the Fat Man in front of him -- \nTALLEY Where's my family?!  Where's my family, you fuck?! \nAll three men are sucking air like freight engines.  No one is shooting, but if one person fires, everyone will fire. Everybody has something the other guy wants.  That's the only thing holding them back -- \nHOWELL Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business. \nTALLEY You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they? \nHowell releases his grip on the gun, and lets it swing free on his finger.  He's trying to cool Talley -- \nHOWELL They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay. \nTALLEY You said they would be here! \nHowell takes out his phone and presses a number.  Talley shifts his aim from Howell to the Fat Man to Manelli -- \nHOWELL (into the phone) Put on the woman. \nHowell offers the phone, but Talley is wary--he can't let go of the Fat Man and he won't put down his pistol.  Howell carefully holds the phone to Talley's ear -- \nTALLEY (into the phone) Jane? \nJANE'S VOICE Jeff, we're -- \nHowell backs away with the phone -- \nHOWELL You have the disks? \nTalley takes out a single disk.  It's the one labeled 'Marlon.'  He tosses it onto the bed -- \nTALLEY You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not talk to them; have them. \nHOWELL Where is it? \nTALLEY Close. \nHowell considers the disk.  If Talley has the second disk in his pocket, Howell could just shoot him.  But Howell can't be sure -- \nHOWELL I have to see if it's real. \nHowell brings the disk to a lap top computer set up in the corner.  He inserts the disk, and waits for it to read.  He's satisfied with what he sees -- \nHOWELL (CONT'D) All right.  Now the second one. \nTALLEY First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk. \nHowell stares at Talley again, then picks up his phone -- \nHOWELL (into the phone) Bring them.  Stop the car outside the room, but don't get out. \n", "test3_true": "HOWELL (CONT'D) (into his phone) Aim your gun at the woman's head.  If he doesn't give me the disk, kill her. \nMarion presses a gun to Jane's temple -- \nTalley jerks his gun toward Howell -- \nTALLEY I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk! \nHOWELL If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them? \nTalley aims at the man in the car; he aims at Howell.  He tried so hard to save his family, and now Howell has him boxed -- \nHOWELL (CONT'D) The negotiation is over, Talley.  I won. Now give me the disk or he'll put her brain on the glass. \nTalley looks at Jane and Amanda, and his eyes fill.  He mouths the words -- \nTALLEY I love you. \nHe's saying good-bye. \nTalley drops his gun and releases the Fat Man, who stumbles away.  Talley tosses a second disk onto the bed.  Manelli scoops it up and tosses it to Howell as Mation appears in the door -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the real FBI.  This one's a fake. \nHOWELL You'd better be kidding. \nHowell anxiously pushes the disk into his lap top -- \nTALLEY I'm a cop, you asshole!  What did you expect me to do?  Pretend all this never happened? \nHowell stares at the lap top with the withering face of a man reading his own death sentence.  There is nothing on this disk. \nTALLEY (CONT'D) Benza's over.  You're over.  I just want to take my family home. \nHowell stands like a mechanical man; incredulous -- \nHOWELL Are you out of your mind? \nMARION (quietly) You fucked up, Glen. \nHowell looks over as if seeing Marion for the first time, and gives him the order -- \nHOWELL Kill them. \nMarion aims his gun directly between Talley's eyes, then points it at Howell -- \nMARION No fuckups allowed. \nMarion shoots Howell in the head, then the Fat Man, then Manelli--bambambam--one shot, one kill. \nHe lowers his gun, considers Talley.  Talley doesn't move. \nMARION (CONT'D) It's like a storm, isn't it?  This raging force that you can't control does whatever it wants, and the best you can do is survive.  A winner survives. \nTALLEY Why...? \nThe question being:  Why aren't I dead?  Why aren't you killing me? \nMARION What good would it do to kill you?  The police already have the disk. \nMarion considers Talley another moment -- \nMARION (CONT'D) Your wife is a very nice lady. \nMarion goes to his car.  He helps out Jane and Amanda, then gets into his car and drives away. \nEXT. THE PARKING LOT -- SUNRISE \nTalley stumbles out of the room and runs to his family.  He scoops up Jane and Amanda, hugging them tightly as the camera pulls up and away, rising, leaving this reunited family as Marion Clewes disappears like a passing thunderhead -- \nCLOSING CREDITS \nThe credits roll to black, then-- \nEXT. SONNY BENZA'S HOME -- DAWN \nThe garage door slides up.  Benza backs out in his Mercedes, then roars to the front door.  He pops the trunk, then gets out and hurries to the front door.  He sticks his head inside and calls to his wife -- \nBENZA The fucking jet's waiting!  Would you get your shit out here?! \nHe picks up two bags from inside the door and brings them to the car -- \nAT THE TRUNK \nBenza steps behind the raised trunk to put away his bags. When he steps back around again, a nondescript sedan is waiting in the drive -- \nA VOICE No fuckups allowed. \nGunfire erupts on the quiet ridge above Palm Springs. \nFADE OUT \nTHE END \n", "test3_id": 1829}

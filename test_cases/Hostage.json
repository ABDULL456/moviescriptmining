{"test1_input": "DEVARONA Married but separated, ex-LAPD.  The fam doesn't live here, but they're coming up today.  I got his address there. \nMANELLI The cops I talked to, they said Talley was a hostage negotiator in LA. \nDEVARONA His last three years on the job.  Before that, he was SWAT. \nMike Ruiz joins in -- \nRUIZ How's a SWAT negotiator make it up here to this shithole? \nDEVARONA I make him for a stress release. \nHOWELL Good work, Gayle--everybody.  Now stay ahead of the curve.  I want to know everything that happens before it happens.  I'll cover Talley. \nHowell tears Talley's address off the yellow pad.  This meeting is over -- \nSEYMORE What if it goes south? \nHOWELL What do you mean? \nSEYMORE If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end. \nHOWELL You worry about your end.  I got my side covered. \nHowell tucks the address in his pocket and goes to the door. \nEXT. DONUT SHOP -- NEWHALL, CALIFORNIA -- NIGHT \nThe sun has set.  The donut shop glows greasily at the end of a strip mall.  It is empty except for the overweight woman behind the counter and a lone man seated at a window booth -- \nINT. THE DONUT SHOP -- NIGHT \nThe man in the booth is named Marion Clewes.  He's an average looking guy, more or less, except for the strange cant to his right eye and the thin black tie he wears over his white J. C. Penney shirt.  His jacket doesn't fit quite right, but not so much as you'd notice.  Marion could disappear into a crowd just by being so ordinary.  That's the point. \nA fat black desert fly, heavy with juice and thorny with coarse hair, buzzes past -- \nMarion watches it, only his eyes moving -- \nThe fly lands in the sprinkles of sugar on the table -- \nMarion watches it, then, suddenly, with no warning, his hand flashes out, slamming down on the table. \nHe holds his hand in place, feeling for movement, then slowly peeks under his hand -- \nThe fly oozes sideways, legs kicking, trying to walk.  One wing beats furiously; the other is broken -- \nMarion examines his hand.  A smear of fly goo and a single black leg streaks his third finger.  Marion touches his tongue to the smear -- \nThe woman behind the counter watches this, her eyes widening with disgust -- \nMarion holds the fly in place with his left index finger, and uses his right to break away another leg.  He eats this leg, too -- \nThe woman disappears into the rear -- \nHeadlights flash across the glass, and Marion swivels around to see Howell's Mercedes pull up -- \nMarion carefully pushes the still-alive fly aside as Glen Howell takes a seat across from him.  Howell puts the yellow slip with Talley's address on the table -- \nHOWELL Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not. \nMARION It won't be a problem. \nHOWELL He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him. \nMARION Okey-doke. \nHOWELL We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him. \nMarion puts Talley's address into his pocket. \nMARION Can we make him dead after we use him? \nGlen Howell slides out of the booth without answering. Marion creeps him out -- \nHOWELL Whatever you want.  Page me when you're done. \nHowell starts away, then turns back -- \nHOWELL (CONT'D) Donuts here any good? \nMARION I don't eat junk food. \nHowell frowns like he might've known, then walks away. Marion turns back to the fly -- \nIt lays there, still, until Marion prods it.  The remaining wing flutters -- \nMarion breaks off the remaining wing and eats that, too. \nEXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT \nTalley and Leigh Metzger stride through a pool of street light as she reports -- \nMETZGER PacBell shows six lines into the house. They blocked all six like you wanted. \n", "test1_true": "METZGER Yes, sir.  They'll only accept calls from your cell. \nTALLEY Way to go. \nThey arrive at Larry Anders, who is waiting at his car with a slim, nervous cement contractor named Brad Dill -- \nANDERS Chief, this is Brad Dill.  Dennis and Kevin work for him. \nDILL I didn't know anything about this.  I didn't know what they were gonna do. \nTALLEY Mr. Dill, these pricks didn't know what they were going to do until they did it. I want you to take a look at something. \nMetzger holds out a still picture that was made from Junior Kim's security tape -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) Can you identify this man? \nDILL That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too. \nTALLEY (to Metzger) Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier. \nMetzger hurries away as Talley turns back to Dill -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that? \nDILL Keeps to himself, more like. \nTALLEY You have his address? \nDILL Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go -- \nDill pulls out a tattered address book.  Talley hands the book to Anders, who copies the address -- \nTALLEY (to Anders) Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house. \nANDERS Yes, sir. \nAnders turns away as Metzger calls from Mrs. Pena's door -- \nMETZGER Chief!  The Sheriffs are ten minutes out! \nTalley has wanted to hear that, but now his sense of relief is tempered by something he did not expect:  Loss. \nTalley keys his shoulder mike -- \nTALLEY (into his radio) Louise? \nLOUISE'S VOICE Go, Chief. \nTALLEY Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place. \nLOUISE'S VOICE I know the one. \nTALLEY Tell her I'm almost home. \nINT. SMITH'S SECURITY CLOSET -- NIGHT \nDennis is on the floor with the money, touching it, feeling it, smelling it.  Mars is standing over him, profoundly unmoved -- \nDENNIS There's gotta be a million bucks here. Maybe two million! \nMars turns away from the money to consider the monitors and the door -- \nMARS It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide. \nDENNIS Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich. \nMARS We're trapped in a house. \nMars walks away -- \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT \nDennis and Mars are returning to the front of the house, Dennis irritated at Mars's lack of enthusiasm -- \nDENNIS We can take it with us. \nMARS You can't run with suitcases. \nDennis grabs Mars by the arm, stopping him -- \nDENNIS Then we'll stuff it up our asses.  This is the payoff.  This is every dream you ever had, all in those two bags. \nMars continues on without responding, Dennis angrily following -- \nINT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nKevin is grimly watching news coverage of their standoff as Mars and Dennis enter.  A female anchor is reporting on the events at York Estates with Dennis's booking photo cut into the picture -- \nANCHOR (from the tube) -- thought to be Dennis James Rooney. Rooney was recently released from the Antelope Valley Correctional Institute where he served time for robbery. \nDennis spots himself on television and breaks into a big smile -- \nDENNIS (thrilled) Check me out!  I look like fuckin' Jon Bon Jovi. \n", "test1_id": 1827, "test2_input": "Thomas slaps the tape back over her mouth.  Jennifer struggles helplessly as Thomas slips back into the closet, and is gone -- \nEXT. YORK ESTATES -- STREET -- NIGHT \nThe Sheriff's Crisis Response Team rolls through the streets like an invading army:  A brown sedan leads a huge van known as the Mobile Command Post, which is followed by a Sheriff's SWAT support vehicle, two SWAT Suburbans, and four radio units. \nPools of light from the helicopters follow their progress -- \nEXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT \nTalley walks out to meet the lead vehicle as the convoy stops.  Up and down the row, uniformed Sheriffs pile out of their vehicles and off-load their gear -- \nTwo people climb out of the lead car:  Will Maddox, a bespectacled African-American Sheriff's SWAT negotiator, and Captain Laura Martin, the CRT commander -- \nTALLEY I'm Talley.  Who's in charge? \nMARTIN Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator -- \nMADDOX Is the perimeter around the house secure? \nTALLEY I've got fourteen officers on my department including me.  We're as secure as we can be. \nMADDOX (to Martin) Permission to deploy the line? \nMARTIN Do it. \nTALLEY (to Maddox) Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile. \nMaddox turns away to bark orders into his shoulder mike -- \nMARTIN Sounds like you know the job. \nTALLEY I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him. \nMARTIN (over her shoulder) Maddox!  You got that? \nMADDOX Doing it now! \nMARTIN (back to Talley) I'd like you to brief my supervisors before we take over the scene. \nTALLEY Whatever you want. \nTalley and Martin hurry toward her troops -- \nINT. THE SMITHS' GARAGE -- NIGHT \nThe garage is dark, lit only by the light that comes from the kitchen's open door, as Dennis, Mars and a reluctant Kevin enter -- \nKEVIN Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up? \nDENNIS (annoyed) That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this -- \nDennis shows them a small casement window, and pushes open the window to reveal a thick hedge -- \nDENNIS (CONT'D) (excited) These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free. \nKEVIN That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us. \nDENNIS Not if they're looking at something else. \nKEVIN Like what? \nMARS Let's burn the house. \nMars says it so simply that the moment is frozen.  Mars is holding the big claw hammer, kneading it as if it was a living thing.  His face is masked by shadows, but his eyes both glow as if already reflecting flame -- \nINT. CRAWLSPACE ABOVE THE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT \nWe see Dennis, Kevin, and Mars through a slit overhead as they emerge from the garage and move back into the house -- \nThomas is watching them.  He has cracked open the service hatch in the laundry room ceiling to make sure that his way is clear -- \nINT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT \nThe room is dark.  When Dennis and the others are gone, the ceiling hatch lifts, and Thomas lets himself down.  He slides onto the washing machine and then to the floor -- \nThomas cups one hand over his flashlight and turns it on.  He lets light leak through his fingers so that he can see.  The beam cuts across a door to the garage, car keys on key hooks, and Jennifer's purse hanging from one of the hooks -- \nINT. HOBBY ROOM -- NIGHT \nThis is a small room off the end of the laundry with a work bench, a stool, and shelves above the bench for Walter's hobby supplies -- \nThomas shines the light over the shelves, spotting the hard plastic pistol case on the highest shelf.  That's the target; that's the goal -- \nThomas uses the stool to climb onto the bench -- \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nDennis is in the doorway to the security closet, handing out one of the money bags to Kevin -- \nKEVIN We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy. \nDENNIS I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives. \n", "test2_true": "KEVIN Everything we're doing is making it worse.  You can't let him burn this house. \nDennis abruptly grabs Kevin by the throat, his face hard with fury -- \nDENNIS Nothing's worse than listening to you. I'm warning you, Kevin--stop holding me back.  Now you pick up that fuckin' money and get ready to go. \nDennis glares at Kevin another moment, then lets go and steps back into the closet -- \nINT. THE CLOSET -- NIGHT \nDennis lifts the second bag of cash when the monitors catch his eye:  The Sheriffs SWAT unit can be seen moving into position.  Dennis totally freaks -- \nDENNIS They're coming!  Kev, Mars, they're coming!!! \nDennis drops the cash and bolts out of the closet -- \nINT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nMars is placing two buckets of gasoline in the hall as Dennis and Kevin pound down the hall -- \nDENNIS The cops are comin'! \nMARS I got the gasoline -- \nDENNIS We don't have time! \nDennis runs to the French doors.  He sees lights at the rear of the property and SHOOTS through the glass -- \nDENNIS (CONT'D) Get the kids!  They're our only chance! \nDennis FIRES AGAIN and runs for the stairs -- \nINT. HOBBY ROOM -- NIGHT \nThomas is straining to reach the pistol which is a fraction of an inch beyond his grasp when he hears Dennis shouting -- \nThomas glances helplessly at the gun case--so near, yet so far--then scrambles off the bench and -- \nINT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT \nThomas is climbing onto the washing machine when he once more sees Jennifer's purse hanging on a key hook -- \nThomas jumps from the washer, grabs the purse, then scrambles into the ceiling as GUNSHOTS ECHO through the house -- \nEXT. COMMAND STREET -- NIGHT \nMartin, Maddox, and her supervisors are gathered around Talley when the gunshots crack across the neighborhood -- \nTALLEY (startled) Who's that shooting?  Martin, what's going on? \nRadio transmissions crackle over Martin's radio -- \nRADIO VOICES Shots fired!  We are taking fire on the back wall! \nTalley immediately knows what's happening, and he knows why -- \nTALLEY They're too close!  I told you not to crowd him!  Pull back your people; do not breach that house! \nTalley sprints toward the cul-de-sac -- \nINT. CRAWLSPACE -- NIGHT \nThomas races through the narrow black tunnel.  He slips off the rafters and almost falls through the ceiling.  He's losing precious time -- \nINT. THE STAIRWELL -- NIGHT \nDennis and Mars pound up the stairs, getting closer to his room -- \nINT. THE CRAWLSPACE -- NIGHT \nThomas pushes his way into his closet -- \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT \nDennis and Mars reach the second floor -- \nINT. THOMAS' ROOM -- NIGHT \nThomas scrambles into bed just before Dennis jerks open the door.  Dennis drags him off the bed and carries him out of the room -- \nEXT. CUL-DE-SAC -- NIGHT \nTalley, Martin, and Maddox run into position behind a Sheriff's unit where a deputy has set up the dedicated crisis phone -- \nTalley grabs up the phone -- \nTALLEY (to the deputy) This thing good? \nTalley doesn't wait for the confused deputy to answer; he presses the button in the handle that dials the phone -- \nMADDOX What in hell are you doing?  He's shooting at my men! \nThe phone rings in Talley's ear -- \n", "test2_id": 1828, "test3_input": "TALLEY (to Maddox) Then get your men off the wall! (to Martin) You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I know this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him. \nMARTIN (to Maddox) Order your men to stand down. \nThe phone is still ringing.  Talley pulls the mike from the deputy's car and speaks over the public address -- \nTALLEY (over the p.a.) Look out the window, Dennis.  We are NOT entering the house.  We're pulling back. \nINT. SMITH'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nDennis is holding Thomas around the neck, using the boy as a shield.  Kevin is cowering on the floor and Mars is holding Jennifer.  Dennis snatches up the phone -- \nDENNIS (screaming into the phone) You fuck!  I got a fuckin' gun to this kid's head!  I'll kill'm, you fuck! \nIntercut Talley outside -- \nTALLEY It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone. \nDENNIS (still screaming) We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here! \nTalley takes a deep breath; he forces himself to speak quietly, calmly -- \nTALLEY No one's coming in.  A couple of guys out here got carried away. \nDennis peers out the front.  Talley's careful manner is calming him -- \nDENNIS Goddamned right they got carried away. It looks like an army out there. \nTalley mutes the phone to speak to Martin -- \nTALLEY (to Martin) It's over.  He's cooling off. \nTalley glances at Maddox.  Maddox nods, his expression saying that Talley was right -- \nDENNIS Talley? \nTALLEY (back into the phone) I'm here. \nDENNIS I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico. \nTALLEY That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter. \nDENNIS I'll give you these people. \nTALLEY The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us. (mutes phone; to Martin and Maddox) I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go? \nMaddox nods at Martin; he's good to go -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) (to Dennis) Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret? \nDENNIS (hesitantly) What? \nTALLEY I gotta piss real bad. \nDennis can't help himself; he laughs -- \nDENNIS You're a funny guy, Talley. \nTALLEY I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while. \nTalley hands the phone to Maddox, who moves past Talley for a better view of the house.  Talley looks grimly at Martin -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) He says he has gasoline set to burn the place. \nMARTIN Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars. \nTALLEY If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up. \nMARTIN (not without humor) Looks like you're bailing out at the right time. \nTALLEY (returns her smile) That's why you get the big bucks, Captain. \nTalley is moving away when his radio pops -- \nLOUISE'S VOICE Chief, base. \nTALLEY (keying his shoulder mike) Go. \nLOUISE'S VOICE I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant. \nTALLEY You have her cell number? \nLOUISE'S VOICE She didn't answer. \nTALLEY They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer. \nTalley closes his phone and continues away -- \nINT. WALTER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT \nDennis and Kevin are at the television, watching an aerial view of the Sheriffs deploying around the house.  Jennifer and Thomas are huddled by their father -- \nKEVIN We're surrounded.  They're all over the neighborhood. \n", "test3_true": "DENNIS What the fuck is that? \nMARS They'll cut the power. \nMars tosses a flashlight to Dennis -- \nJENNIFER What about my father? \nDENNIS Aw, Jesus, not more of this. \nJENNIFER Look at him!  I think he's dying! \nDENNIS (to Kevin and Mars) Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway. \nDennis returns to the shutters as Mars and Kevin take the kids -- \nINT. THOMAS' ROOM -- NIGHT \nMars shoves Thomas into the room, then lifts the claw hammer. For an instant, we think he's going to hit the boy--but he smashes off the door knob, instead. \nMars glares at Thomas, then pulls the door closed.  The knob on Thomas's side is gone; there's no way for Thomas to open the door. \nBut that's okay by Thomas.  He waits until he's sure that Mars is gone, and then he hurries back to his closet -- \nINT. THOMAS' CLOSET -- NIGHT \nThomas pulls open the hatch, fishes out his flashlight, then dumps the contents of Jennifer's purse on the floor. \nHe picks up her cell phone. \nINT. MRS. PENA'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT \nTalley closes his eyes with a blissful expression as a familiar sound fills the bathroom; he's taking a piss. \nHis radio crackles -- \nLOUISE'S VOICE Chief, base. \nTalley finishes his business, and keys his mike -- \nTALLEY Did you find Jane and Mandy? \nLOUISE'S VOICE Could you call me back on your phone? Right away. \nTALLEY What's wrong with the radio? \nLOUISE'S VOICE (hesitantly) Other people can hear us.  Just call. Please. \nTALLEY Stand by. \nNow Talley is worried.  He pulls out his phone and punches the speed dial.  It rings only once -- \nIntercut Louise, at her desk outside Talley's office -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) Is something wrong with Jane? \nLOUISE We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house. \nTALLEY It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that! \nLOUISE His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house. \nTalley worries it only for a moment -- \nTALLEY Put him on. \nTalley pushes out of the bathroom into -- \nINT. MRS. PENA'S FAMILY ROOM -- NIGHT \nHe flags Leigh Metzger as he cups the phone -- \nTALLEY (to Metzger) Get Martin.  Right away. \nAs Metzger hurries away, we intercut Thomas, hiding in the shadows on his bed, whispering so as not to be overheard -- \nTALLEY (CONT'D) (into the phone) This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son. \nTHOMAS Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him. \nTalley can tell by the tremor in the boy's voice--this is for real -- \nTALLEY Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot? \nTHOMAS Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared. \nTALLEY How about you and your sister? \nTHOMAS We're okay. \nTALLEY Where are you right now? \nTHOMAS In my room. \n", "test3_id": 1829}

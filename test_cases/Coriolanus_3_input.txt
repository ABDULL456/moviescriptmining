TAMORA He's a disease that must be cut away. 
MENENIUS 0, he's a limb that has but a disease: Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy. What has he done to Rome that's worth his death? Eh? Killing our enemies?! He sees that his words are having some effect, he presses the 
POINT: 
MENENIUS The blood he hath lost -- He dropped it for his country. Some in the room murmur agreement. 
BRUTUS We'll hear no more-- 
MENENIUS Consider this: he has been bred in the 
WARS Since he could draw a sword, and is ill 
SCHOOLED In graceful language Give me leave, I'll go to him, and undertake to bring 
HIM Where he shall answer by a lawful form, In peace, to his utmost peril. 
PRO-CORIOLANUS SENATOR Noble tribunes, It is the humane way. 
ANOTHER SENATOR The other course Will prove too bloody, and the end of it Unknown to the beginning. Sicinius is about to retort when Brutus stops him. Brutus assents, assuming the voice of reason: 
BRUTUS Be you then as the people's officer. Menenius and Coriolanus' supporters are relieved. 
BRUTUS If you bring not Martius, we'll proceed In our first way.

Coriolanus strides angrily down a long corridor, in and out of shafts of light, seething to Titus: 
CORIOLANUS Let them pull all about mine ears,

TITUS 
MARTIUS-- 
CORIOLANUS 
(CONTINUING UNABATED) I muse my mother Does not approve me further! He slams through a door to the living room... 
INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY 
And stomps to confront his mother, who is currently conspiring with Menenius and a few Senators. 
CORIOLANUS (to Volumnia, angrily) I talk of you! Why did you wish me milder? Would you 
HAVE ME False to my nature? Rather say I play The man I am! She is equally tough with him, not giving an inch, snapping 
RIGHT BACK: 
VOLUMNIA 0, sir, sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on, Before you had worn it out.

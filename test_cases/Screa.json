{"train": "SCREAM (SCARY MOVIE) \nby Kevin Williamson \nRewrite July 31, 1995 \nFADE IN \nON A RINGING TELEPHONE. \nA hand reaches for it, bringing the receiver up to the face of CASEY BECKER, a young girl, no more than sixteen.  A friendly face with innocent eyes. \nCASEY Hello. \nMAN'S VOICE (from phone) Hello. \nSilence. \nCASEY Yes. \nMAN Who is this? \nCASEY Who are you trying to reach? \nMAN What number is this? \nCASEY What number are you trying to reach? \nMAN I don't know. \nCASEY I think you have the wrong number. \nMAN Do I? \nCASEY It happens. Take it easy. \nCLICK! She hangs up the phone.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Casey in a living room, alone.  She moves from the living room to the kitchen.  It's a nice house.  Affluent. \nThe phone RINGS again. \nINT.  KITCHEN \nCasey grabs the portable. \nCASEY Hello. \nMAN I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number. \nCASEY So why did you dial it again? \nMAN To apologize. \nCASEY You're forgiven. Bye now. \nMAN Wait, wait, don't hang up. \nCasey stands in front of a sliding glass door.  It's pitch black outside. \nCASEY What? \nMAN I want to talk to you for a second. \nCASEY They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya. \nCLICK!  Casey hangs up.  A grin on her face. \nEXT.  CASEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING \nA big country home with a huge sprawling lawn full of big oak trees.  It sits alone with no neighbors in sight. \nThe phone RINGS again. \nINT.  KITCHEN \nPopcorn sizzles in a pot on the stove.  Casey covers it with a lid, reaching for the portable phone. \nCASEY Hello. \nMAN Why don't you want to talk to me? \nCASEY Who is this? \nMAN You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine. \nCASEY (shaking the popcorn) I don't think so. \nMAN What's that noise? \nCasey smiles, playing along, innocently. \nCASEY Popcorn. \nMAN You're making popcorn? \nCASEY Dial someone else, okay? \nMAN You getting scared? \nCASEY No-bored. \nCLICK.  She hangs up.  The phone RINGS again.  She grabs it. \nCASEY Listen, asshole... \nMAN (deadly serious) NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND? \nTotal silence.  He has gotten her full attention. \nCASEY Is this some kind of a joke? \nMAN More of a game, really. \nCasey eyes the glass doors, then looks up the hallway to the front doors...moving to it.  It's unlocked.  She bolts it. \nCASEY I'm two seconds from calling the police. \nMAN They'd never make it in time. \nCasey moves her face flush against the door, her eye looking through the peephole. \nANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE. \nA distorted view of the front porch.  It is empty.  She relaxes a bit, relieved. \nCASEY What do you want? \nMAN (pure evil) TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE. \nCasey's jaw drops as total fear storms her face.  She hangs up the phone, throwing it down on a side table when... \nTHE DOORBELL CHIMES. \nCasey leaps out of her skin.  She turns to the door as it chimes again. \nCASEY (calling out) Who's there? \nAnother CHIME.  She moves to it. \nCASEY (louder) Who's there? \nNo answer.  Fuck this.  It's time for the police.  She goes for the portable phone. Just as she picks it up... \nIT RINGS. \nCasey almost drops it, losing her breath... \nShe brings it to her ear with trembling hands, saying nothing...listening, waiting... \nA long silence.  And then. \nMAN You should never say \"Who's there?\". Don't you watch scary movies? It's a death wish. \nCasey clutches the wall, nearly collapsing.  She tries her damndest to hang tough. \nCASEY Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else. \nMAN Or else what? \nCLOSE ON her face, her mind thinking, calculating... \nCASEY My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him... \nMAN I thought you didn't have a boyfriend. \nBusted.  She holds steady. \nCASEY I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone. \nMAN Sure... \nCASEY I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you. \nMAN I'm getting scared. \nCASEY I'm telling you the truth. I lied before... \nMAN I believe you... \nCASEY So you better leave. \nMAN His name wouldn't be Steve, would it? \nSilence.  Casey buckles at the knees, losing it. \nCASEY How do you know his name? \nMAN Go to the back door and turn on the porch light--again. \nSuddenly...through tears...Godsent... \nCASEY (a whisper) Michael...Michael Myers. \nMAN YES! \nCasey SIGHS...relieved. \nMAN Now for the real question. \nCASEY NOOOO.... \nMAN But you're doing so well. \nCASEY Please go away! Leave us alone! \nMAN Then answer the question. Same category. \nCasey is a blubbering, wet mass on the floor. \nCASEY ..please..no... \nMAN Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH. \nA mad smile purses Casey's lips.  She knows this.  She leaps up, through tears, screaming... \nCASEY Jason! Jason!...JASON! \nA slight PAUSE. \nMAN I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer. \nCASEY No it's not. It was Jason. \nMAN Afraid not. \nCASEY It was Jason. I saw that godamned movie twenty times. It was Jason. \nMAN Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -Mrs.Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel. \nCasey is stupefied. \nCASEY You tricked me... \nMAN Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve...I'm afraid...he's out. \nThis implication sends Casey running to the kitchen...to the glass doors.  She flips on the porch lights to see... \nSTEVE \neyes wide, sitting in the lawn chair...his belly gaping open...a mass of blood and ripped flesh...his insides lay on the ground between his feet...steam rising. \nA SCREAM erupts from the bottom of her soul as Casey collapse on the floor...nearly passing out.  CLOSE ON her face...pale and ghostly white.  She SOBS. \nMAN Final question. Are you ready? \nShe doesn't answer.  A long, maddening silence.  Casey reaches up and CLICKS off the light, making Steve go away...wishing, hoping... \nCASEY ..leave me alone..please... \nMAN Answer the question and I will. \nCasey is curled up on the floor like an infant, rocking slowly back and forth. \nMAN What door am I at? \nCASEY What? \nMAN There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly-you live. \nFrom where Casey sits she can see both front and back doors.  She deliberates...with her last bit of strength she tries to strategize.  Eyeing both, the front door...the back door trying to decide between the two. \nCASEY Don't make me...I can't...I won't. \nMAN Your call. \nIn the darkness, Casey crawls to the kitchen counter-she leans up and grabs a long, sharp knife. \nCasey looks around her...she looks down the hall to the front door...then turns back to the kitchen glass door as it suddenly... \nSHATTERS TO BITS... \nas a lawn chair come flying through it.  Exploding glass sprays everywhere. \nThis incites Casey like fire.  She springs to her feet...bolting out of the kitchen as a SHADOW moves quickly through the shattered doorframe. \nANGLE ON CASEY \nSomewhere in the house, back flat against a window, listening to FEET ON CRACKING GLASS.  She turns and unlocks the latch, quietly sliding it up. She can hear him move through the foyer...to the front door. \nCasey lifts herself up and puts her legs through the window.  She holds the knife in one hand, the phone in the other. \nCasey eases out the window, fumbling, dropping the knife back in the house.  She starts to reach for it.  Fuck it, she takes off... \nEXT.  SIDEWALK \nSidney approaches the school seeing the commotion.  Four different REPORTERS stand in front of four different cameras giving four different news reports. \nShe moves passed a policeman standing guard.  Her interest peaked, she stops at the first reporter who is... \nGALE WEATHERS \nThirties.  He smart face is overshadowed by a flashy smile and a massive mane of chemically enhanced hair. \nGALE (for the camera) The small town of Bayboro, North Carolina was devastated last night when two young teenagers were found brutally butchered. Authorities have yet to issue a statement but our sources tell us that no arrest has been made and the murderer could strike again... \nON SIDNEY.  Moved, disturbed.  From behind, a finger taps her shoulder.  She spins around to see... \nTatum Riley, same age, feisty, carefree. \nTATUM Do you believe this shit? \nSIDNEY What happened? \nThey break away from the crowd and head for school. \nTATUM Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night. \nSIDNEY No way. \nTATUM And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end. \nSIDNEY Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English. \nTATUM Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside. \nSIDNEY Do they know who did it? \nTATUM Fucking clueless-they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors... \nSIDNEY They think it's school-related? \nTATUM They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than... (stopping herself) Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big. \nSidney looks back at Gale, her face deeply pained. \nINT.  CLASSROOM - LATER \nA frumpy old woman, MRS. TATE, faces her class.  Her hands clasped together.  A tragic look upon her face. \nMRS. TATE ..a terrible tragedy. An unbearable loss. It's days like today we need prayer in school... \nSidney sits near the rear of the room.  The desk in front of her sits vacant.  Sidney can't take her eyes of it. \nThe door opens and a student opens with a slip of paper.  He hand s it to Mrs. Tate. \nMRS. TATE Sidney. It appears to be your turn. \nINT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE \nThe room is at capacity...wall to wall with police, and the likes. Some sit, stand, lean... \nSHERIFF BURKE, a round man in his fifties, wipes the stress from his face. \nSHERIFF BURKE Who's up next? \nA young officer looks at the clipboard.  This is DEPUTY RILEY, better known as DEWEY.  He's a big guy, 20's, handsome in a scrubbed-clean boyish way. \nDEWEY Sidney Prescott. \nSheriff Burke gestures to bring her in.  PRINCIPAL HIMBRY, 50's, an old codger of a man wearing a sour face speaks up. \nMR. HIMBRY Sidney Prescott. She was daughter of... \nDEWEY We all know Sidney, Mr. Himbry. \nSHERIFF BURKE How she doin'? \nMR. HIMBRY She's adjusted well. Maintains an \"A\" average. You never know she... \nHimbry stops short, seeing Sidney in the doorway.  He rises and seats her. \nSHERIFF BURKE Hi Sidney. \nSIDNEY Sheriff Burke. Dewey. \nDewey shakes his head seriously. \nDEWEY It's Deputy Riley today, Sid. \nSHERIFF BURKE How is everything? \nSIDNEY Good. \nSHERIFF BURKE And your Dad? How's he doing? \nSIDNEY We're fine. Thanks. \nRANDY (to Stu) Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox. \nTATUM (eyeing Sidney) Randy, you goon-fuck, I'm eating here. \nStu nibbles at Tatum's neck. \nSTU Yeah, Randy, she's getting mad. I think you better liver alone. \nStu cracks up at his own joke.  The others just MOAN.  Sidney is about to crawl out of her skin, trying hard to ignore it all. \nEXT.  SIDNEY'S HOUSE - LATER \nA huge two story country home with a spacious lawn. \nA yellow school bus stops in front of the house and Sidney steps off. \nThe house looks big and lonely as Sidney moves up the walk to the front door. \nINT.  BEDROOM - LATER \nSidney is on the telephone. \nSIDNEY (into phone) You sure I can stay over?  My dad won't be back til Sunday. \nTATUM (through phone) No prob. I'll pick you up after practice. \nSIDNEY Tell your mom I said thanks. \nTATUM Yeah, yeah...are you okay? \nSIDNEY Uh-huh, it's just...you know, the police and reporters...it brings it all back. \nTATUM I'll be there by seven. I promise \nSIDNEY Thanks, Tatum. \nTATUM Later. \nSidney hangs up.  She takes a seat at her computer and boots it up.  She sits in front of it staring at the blue screen...her own reflection staring back. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER \nSidney comes down the stairs, her arms carrying a change of clothes, toothbrush, make-up... \nShe opens the hall closet and pulls a small overnight bag from the top shelf.  Moving into the living room she loads it up, plopping down on the sofa, hitting the TV remote. \nCLOSE ON THE SCREEN \nA news reporter fades in. \nREPORTER #1 (on TV) The entire nation was shocked today by the teen murders in North Carolina... \nSidney switches channels. \nREPORTER #2 The State Bureau of Investigation has joined forces with local authorities to help catch what the Governor has called the most heinous... \nThe channel switches again.  Gale weathers appears, standing in front of the school.  Her white teeth gleaming. \nGALE This is not the first time the small town of Bayboro has endured such tragedy. Only a year ago, Maureen Prescott, wife and mother, was found raped and murdered... \nAn old black and white snapshot fills the screen-a woman, beautiful and familiar. \nCLOSE ON SIDNEY \neyes frozen, mesmerized by the image.  Suddenly she CLICKS the TV off.  Her eyes go to the clock on the end table.  5:45 PM.  Her eyes then move to the framed photo next to it...the same black and white photo stares at her...a healthy, vibrant woman.  An older version of Sidney. \nSidney curls up on the sofa closing her eyes tight... \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER \nThe clock on the end table reads 7:15 PM.  Sidney is fast asleep on the couch.  The phone RINGS.  Sidney leaps up grabbing the portable phone. \nTATUM (from phone) Practice ran late. I'm on my way. \nSIDNEY (eyes clock) It's past seven. \nTATUM Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten. \nSIDNEY I'm not worried. \nTATUM Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis. \nSIDNEY Whatever. Just hurry. \nTATUM Bye. \nShe hangs up the phone.  It immediately RINGS again. \nSIDNEY (into phone) Tatum? \nMAN'S VOICE (from phone) Hello, Sidney. \nIT'S HIM.  THE VOICE FROM BEFORE. \nShe moves to the front door, unlocks it...pulls it open...it catches on the chain.  Shit!  She pushes it closed again looking behind her..the FIGURE has risen, knife in hand. Sidney pulls on the chain and then-inexplicably turns and... \nRUNS UP THE STAIRS.  The FIGURE right behind her. \nINT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING \nThe FIGURE leaps at Sidney taking hold of her foot, she grabs madly at the wall...her hands grasp a framed painting-a quiet country home, subdued colors, done in oils-she rips it from the wall swinging it behind her... \nIt catches the FIGURE head on, smashing against his skull, sending him backwards, tumbling down the stairs.  Sidney races to her bedroom... \nINT.  BEDROOM \nShe locks the door shut, the pulls her closet door open, placing the edge right at the door knob just as... \nTHE FIGURE POUNDS AGAINST THE BEDROOM DOOR... \nramming it, it rips open, but the closet door catches it in a crazy vice-like hold. \nSidney grabs the desk phone.  It's dead...off the hook downstairs. \nThe figure rushes the door several times..the frame splinters..but won't give. \nSidney is at her computer, she punches at the keypad madly. \nCLOSE ON SCREEN AS WORDS APPEAR. \nFAX MODEM \n9-1-1 SEND \nThe knife slashes through the crack in the door wildly. \nON SCREEN AGAIN \nHELP KILLER \n34 ELM ST \nSidney presses SEND when it occurs to her-all is quiet.  The FIGURE is gone.  A fearful silence.  She looks around...the only sound her own rapid, terrified BREATHING. \nON THE SCREEN \n\"Stay calm.  Police enroute.\" \nSuddenly a NOISE at the window...Sidney looks up to see... \nBILLY \nher boyfriend, staring at her, surprised. \nSIDNEY Oh Billy...Please...God... \nBILLY I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay... \nSIDNEY He's here. He's trying to kill me... \nBilly pulls himself through the window.  As he does, a small black object falls from his dark jeans.  It hits the floor as Sidney eyes it...a sleek, compact cellular phone. \nSidney stops in her tracks.  Their eyes meet...an eternity.  A SIREN is heard in the distance.  Sidney bolts... \nBILLY Hey...wait...what's goin.. \nBilly reaches for her.  Sidney unblocks the bedroom door and tears out of the room. \nINT.  LANDING \nSidney nearly falls down the stairs... \nINT.  FOYER \nShe rips the chain off the door, pulls it open, coming face to face with a white, ghostly mask. A massive SCREAM erupts from her gut as... \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK \nto find Dewey-Deputy Riley, holding it.  Red lights flash, sirens BLAST vas car after car surrounds the house. \nSidney falls into the safety of Dewey's arms. \nEXT.  FRONT YARD - MINUTES LATER \nThe yard is a whirlwind of activity.  An ambulance, squad cars, cops everywhere... \nCLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE \nas it SMASHES against the hood of a police car.  His hands are being cuffed, his rights being read. \nBILLY (screaming) I didn't do anything! Sid...where's Sid? Ask her, she'll tell ya... \nDewey holds a car door open as Sheriff Burke steps out. \nDEWEY We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis. \nSHERIFF BURKE Hank Loomis' kid? Aw..Jesus... \nGale moves back to the van leaving Kenny miffed. \nINT.  POLICE STATION \nA small town station.  The bull pen is a little square room with four desks and tonight--it's hopping.  Cops everywhere. \nINT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE \nSidney sits at a desk drinking a cup of water.  She wears the Sheriff's jacket over her shoulders.  Dewey approaches. \nSIDNEY Did you reach my Dad? \nDEWEY You're sure it was the Hilton? \nSIDNEY At the airport. \nDEWEY He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel? \nSIDNEY I don't know. I guess. \nDEWEY We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry. \nSidney stares blankly, numb. \nINT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE \nBilly sits opposite Sheriff Burke.  Next to Billy, sits his father, HANK LOOMIS, an older version of Billy. \nSHERIFF BURKE What are you doing with a cellular telephone, son? \nMR. LOOMIS It's my phone. He was just playing around with it. \nSHERIFF BURKE You got some ideas of playing around, boy. \nBILLY I didn't call anyone with it. I just took it for fun. \nMR. LOOMIS Everybody's got one now. Why don't you check the phone bill for chrissakes. Call my carrier--AirFone Comp. They'll have records of every number dialed. \nSHERIFF BURKE Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight? \nBILLY I just wanted to see her, that's all. \nSHERIFF BURKE You rode your bike out there? \nBILLY Yes, sir. \nSHERIFF BURKE And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too? \nMR. LOOMIS (surprised) You were out last night? \nBILLY I watched TV for awhile but the I felt like going for a bike ride. \nSHERIFF BURKE Did you ride past Casey Becker's house? \nBILLY No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff. \nSHERIFF BURKE We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here. \nBilly fights tears. \nBILLY This is crazy. I didn't do it. \nSheriff Burke eyes him up and down, very carefully. \nINT.  POLICE BULL PEN - MINUTES LATER \nTatum has joined Sidney.  The sheriff's door opens and Billy is led out by a coupla UNIFORMS.  Burke and Dewey appear in the door watching Tatum comfort Sidney. \nOUT OF EAR SHOT \nDEWEY That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records. \nSHERIFF BURKE What about the cellular phone bill? \nDEWEY They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it? \nSHERIFF BURKE Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today...damn if I know. \nTATUM (o.s.) Hey...Dewey. Can we go now? \nDEWEY Hold up a sec... \nSHERIFF BURKE She staying with you? \nDEWEY We haven't located her Dad yet. \nTATUM (o.s.) Goddammit, Dewey! \nDewey turns to her, his face red. \nDEWEY What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law. \nTATUM I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go. \nTATUM Take a message. \nSIDNEY It's alright. I'll get it. \nSidney takes off out the door.  Mama Riley motions to Tatum. \nMAMA RILEY (whispers) How is she? \nTatum shrugs. \nINT.  HALLWAY \nSidney grabs the phone at the end of the hall. \nSIDNEY Hello? \nMAN (from phone) Hello Sidney. \nIT'S HIM.  The CAMERA does a Hitchcock as Sidney's entire body goes weak..his VOICE moving through her..invading her.  She CRIES OUT. \nSIDNEY NOOOOOO... \nMama Riley turns in the doorway.  Tatum comes bolting out of the bedroom. \nMAN (from phone) Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you. \nSIDNEY LEAVEMEALONE! \nMAN Looks like you fingered the wrong guy...again. \nSIDNEY Who are you? \nTATUM Hang up, Sid. \nMAN Don't worry. You'll find out soon enough. I promise. \nMama Riley BEATS on a closed bedroom door. \nMAMA RILEY Dewey! Dewey! \nMAN This is gonna be fun, Sidney. Just like old times. \nCLICK. \nDewey flies out of his room wearing only his boxers...holding his gun. \nDEWEY What? What? \nThe phone goes dead.  Sidney stands frozen. \nEXT.  BAYBORO MAIN STREET - DAWN - ESTABLISHING \nThe morning sun shines high over Bayboro Townsquare.  Cars come to life, townsfolk stir as the picture postcard community awakens from a restless sleep. \nINT.  KITCHEN - MORNING \nSidney and Tatum sit at the kitchen table, dressed and ready for school as Mama Riley serves up breakfast.  A small television sits on the counter BLARING. \nDewey, in uniform, stands near the door, talking on the phone. \nMAMA RILEY I think you girls really should stay home today. \nTATUM Your objection is duly noted. \nSIDNEY I'd rather be around a lot of people, Mama Riley. \nFrom the TV, Sidney hears her name, \"SIDNEY PRESCOTT...\"  All eyes go to the television. \nREPORTER (on TV) ..who escaped a vicious attack last night was the daughter of Maureen Prescott who was brutally killed last year when convicted murderer Cotton Weary... \nINSERT of COTTON WEARY, in prison fatigues.  A once handsome man, now haggard and worn. \nREPORTER (cont'd) ..broke into their home and savagely raped and tortured the deceased. Cotton Weary is currently awaiting appeal for the death sentence handed down after the young Sidney testified against him. She was the key witness in the state's prosecution... \nSIDNEY It's never gonna stop. Is it? \nDewey is off the phone. \nDEWEY Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls. \nSIDNEY Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up. \nDEWEY I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross- referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him. \nSIDNEY And my Dad? Any word on him? \nRiley shakes his head \"no\". \nEXT.  SCHOOL STREET - LATER \nOnce again, REPORTERS line the street attacking students as they make their way to school, asking questions, hungry for that teenage insight. \nDewey's patrol jeep cruises by.  Sidney watches from the passenger's window. \nBut there's doubt in her voice.  Gale's face lights up. \nGALE You're not so sure anymore, are you? \nSidney clams up. \nSIDNEY No, it was Cotton. \nTatum comes waltzing up. \nTATUM (to GALE) Nice welt. \nGale ignores her, zeroing in on Sidney, half realizing. \nGALE The killer is still on the loose, isn't he? These murders are related. \nTATUM Yo--let's rock. \nSidney starts to fidget. \nSIDNEY I'm sorry I mangled your face. \nShe take off with Tatum.  Gale calls after her. \nGALE Wait, Sidney, don't go... \nBut Sidney and Tatum have already disappeared in the crowd of students moving across campus. \nGale looks to Kenny. \nGALE Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming. \nKENNY You want to go live? \nGale's mind races with possibilities. \nGALE No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete. \nKENNY When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge. \nGALE If I'm gonna blow this up-I need hard proof. \nKENNY But it's so much easier when we make it up. \nGALE Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty. \nEXT.  SCHOOL CAMPUS - SECONDS LATER \nTatum and Sidney make their way across campus. \nTATUM Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here. \nSIDNEY But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now. \nThey move up the walk as a FIGURE falls in step behind them, sporting a WHITE GHOST MASK. \nTATUM Serial killers are smart by definition. They minimize their risk. They plan and pre-calculate everything. Showing up here would be the most lame-brain move he could make. \nSIDNEY He promised me he'd be back. \nAs easy as the figure appeared, it disappears-falling out of site, unseen by either of them. \nTATUM I wouldn't put too much stock in a psycho's promise. \nThey move up the front steps toward the main doors of the school as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE reappears...standing at the top of the steps...Sidney sees it first, stopping dead in her tracks. \nShe steps back, spinning around to find... \nA GHOST FACE behind her as well, both of them approaching, closing in on her.  Sidney starts to SCREAM when the two ghosts bust up LAUGHING, tearing off across campus. \nEXT.  STREET \nIn front of the school we catch up a REPORTER doing a live remote. He holds a mask in his hand. \nREPORTER This morning several students, in what appears to be a prank, have been spotted wearing masks. School officials have yet to comment but this is the same type of mask worn by the killer... \nINT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER \nJust before the bell.  The hallway is congested with students heading to class.  Tatum is at her locker with Sidney. \nSIDNEY This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here. \nTATUM I want you to meet me here right after class, okay? \nBilly appears in the crowd, with Stu tagging behind.  Tatum spots him first. \nTATUM Shit, what is he doing here? \nSIDNEY I bet he's pissed. \nTATUM Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did. \nBilly and Stu approach.  Billy's face is solemn. \nGIRL #2 Why would she lie about it? \nGIRL #1 For attention. The girl has some serious issues. \nSidney listens intently. \nA toilet FLUSHES.  Sidney quickly jumps in a stall, hiding, just as GIRL #1 appears from a stall.  She looks like that voice--a snotty little twit. \nGIRL #1 What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve? \nGIRL #2 And why would she do that? \nGIRL #1 Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage. \nAnother toilet FLUSHES. \nGIRL #2 Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy. \nGIRL #1 Maybe she's a slut just like her mom. \nINSIDE THE STALL Sidney listens.  Her face weakening. \nGIRL #2 You're evil. \nGIRL #1 Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop. \nGIRL #2 appears from her stall--another twit.  They both stand in front of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces. \nGIRL #2 Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered. \nGIRL #1 And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression. \nFrom the stall, Sidney listens, her heart pounding, jaw quivering. \nGIRL #2 Where do you get this shit? \nGIRL #1 Ricki Lake. \nThe two girls exit.  Sidney moves out of the stall, catching her reflection in the mirror. \nSIDNEY Pathetic. \nWater DRIPS somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind WHISTLES in from the cracked transom above the bathroom door.  It sound almost like a whisper,   \"Siddneey...\" \nSidney spins around.  What the...  She checks out the bathroom. The doors to the stalls are all closed.  She bends down and scans beneath them, looking for feet.  No one.  Nothing. \nSidney turns back to the mirror.  Suddenly... \nMAN (o.c. whisper) Siddneey... \nUnmistakable this time.  The VOICE strikes Sidney like a nail through the eye.  It comes from one of the stalls.  She stands thunderstruck, eyeing the stalls thru the mirror. \nSIDNEY Is someone there? \nA long, morose silence.  And then: \nMAN (softly, simply) It's me, Sidney. \nSidney spins around.  Fuck no!  HE'S HERE.  Terror floods her face.  She eyes the exit door, then the row of stalls she must pass to get to it. \nShe checks under the stalls again.  Nothing...where the fuck is he?  She takes a step forward when... \nTWO FEET step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall. Sidney's face draws tight as the stall door begins to CREAK open. She bolts forward, making a break for it...but slips on the wet floor...her feet flying out from under... \nSidney reaches out...grabs hold of a sink...saves herself from falling...she glimpses a GHOST MASK in the mirror coming for her. A hand grabs her shoulder as she SLAMS her body through the exit door...narrowly escaping. \nINT.  CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nSidney flies out of the bathroom door SCREAMING...burning up the hallway, not looking back.  A TEACHER, hearing her SCREAM, peer out from an open doorway...as Sidney sprints by him, not stopping...running madly. \nINT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nCLOSE on a red-faced Principal Himbry as he reads someone the riot act. \nMR. HIMBRY I'm sickened. Your whole havoc-inducing, thieving, whoring generation disgusts me. \nThe CAMERA SWINGS AROUND to reveal two GHOST MASKED STUDENTS standing at attention.  Mr. Himbry rips the mask off of one of the student's heads. \nMR. HIMBRY Two students have been savagely murdered. And this is how we express our compassion and sensivity? \nHe rips the mask off the other student. \nMR. HIMBRY We throw on a mask and dance around campus just hoping someone else gets butchered before we get bored again. You're both expelled. \nThe GHOSTS doth protest... \nGHOST #1 Aw, come on, Mr. Himbry, it was just a joke. \nGHOST #2 Yeah, that's not fair. \nA deep rooted hostility has taken over Mr. Himbry's face.  Neither student budges, scared to even breathe. \nMR. HIMBRY No, it's not fair. Fairness would be to rip your insides out and hang you from a tree so you can be exposed for the desensitized, heartless little shits that you are. \nSIDNEY It was him, Tatum. I know it. \nTatum wants to believe her but... \nTATUM You are not to be alone again. Is that clear? If you pee--I pee. \nStu appears. \nSTU Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened? \nTATUM For once, Stu, drop it. \nSTU Okay, but whatever you did--the entire student body thanks you. \nStu moves to Tatum and gives her a kiss. \nSTU And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house. \nSIDNEY Are you serious? \nSTU My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'. \nTatum warms to the idea. \nTATUM This could be good. What do you think, Sid? \nSIDNEY I don't know... \nTATUM Come on. Pathos has it's perks. \nSidney considers trying hard to be good spirited. \nSTU Remember, there's safety in numbers. \nSIDNEY (giving in) Yeah, okay...whatever. \nSTU Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food. \nStu speeds off, sliding down the empty hallway. \nINT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER \nMr. Himbry sits at his desk staring at the ghosts masks before him.  He picks one of them up, snickering. \nMR. HIMBRY Damn... \nHe stands and moves to the closet next to his office door.  He pulls it open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door.  He tries the mask on, pulling it over his face, looking in the mirror when... \nA KNOCK AT THE DOOR stops him.  He rips the mask off his head, turns to his office door and opens it to reveal... \nAN EMPTY DOORWAY.  He pokes his head into the outer office area and looks around.  But no one's there. \nMR. HIMBRY Yes? Hello? \nThe place is empty.  A little suspicious he closes the door, catching his reflection in the closet mirror.  He looks at the mask in his hands.  Jesus, even he's jumpy.  Two seconds later... \nANOTHER KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  Himbry grabs the door quickly, this time throwing it open.  Again no one's there.  He steps out into the outer office determined to catch a prankster. \nINT.  OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nCompletely empty.  Mr. Himbry moves through the outer office and into the school corridor.  The overhead lights have been turned off and the corridor is now dark and deserted.  He looks up and down the hall.  Only a JANITOR is seen in the distance pushing a broom. \nMR. HIMBRY Little shits. \nMr. Himbry returns to his office. \nINT.  OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nHimbry reenters his office, moving to his desk, when he spots the closet door NOW CLOSED SHUT. \nThis gives him a pause-he had left it open.  Hadn't he?  Suddenly, he can't remember.  He shifts uneasy, reaching for the door knob, pulling the door open to reveal... \nAN EMPTY CLOSET.  He stands still a moment, suddenly realizing someone could easily now be standing behind the open closet door. Nervously, he pushes it shut to reveal... \nNOTHING.  Himbry shakes away his jitters, realizing he's spooked himself.  He continues to his desk, pushing his office door shut when... \nA GHOST MASKED FIGURE lunges from behind it...knife in hand. Quick and easy.  Three quick jabs to the stomach and Himbry goes down.  The GHOST MASKED FIGURE towering above him. \nEXT.  TATUM'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON - LATER \nThe late afternoon sun is quickly disappearing. \nTatum and Sidney rock on the front porch looking out into the small town neighborhood.  Dewey's patrol jeep is parked in the driveway. \nDespite loud music, BLARING from an inside stereo, this is a quiet moment. \nTATUM Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom. \nSIDNEY So you think my mom was a slut too? \nTATUM I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman. \nSIDNEY If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court? \nSTU Which is you... \nRANDY So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition. \nBILLY (o.c.) How do we know you're not the killer? \nRandy spins around to find Billy right behind him.  Busted. \nRANDY Uh...hi, Billy. \nBILLY Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost it's reality button? \nRandy shrugs, laughing it off. \nRANDY You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect. \nSTU And what would be your motive? \nRANDY It's 1995--motives are incidental. \nEXT.  MAIN STREET - LITTLE LATER \nDewey's patrol jeep makes it's way down mainstreet.  It's almost dark.  The street is close to deserted. \nINT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS \nDewey's behind the wheel having a heated conversation with Tatum while Sid stares out the window. \nDEWEY A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me. \nTATUM Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out--we'll be perfectly safe. \nSid stares out the window. CLOSED SIGNS fill the storefronts, a few people rush to their car, in a hurry to beat curfew. \nSIDNEY God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN. \nDEWEY Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas. \nTATUM Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you? \nSIDNEY Oh, god... \nDewey comes to a stop, parking the car in front of the police station. He looks to Sid with a brotherly smile. \nDEWEY I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself. \nSIDNEY Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling. \nEXT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS \nThey pile out of the jeep.  Dewey heads for the station. \nDEWEY I'll just be a few minutes. Don't go far. \nThe girls take off for the local supermarket that sits across the street. \nSIDNEY Is Billy going to be there tonight? \nTATUM He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night. \nThey approach the grocery store.  Small and simple.  Sid and Tatum grab a shopping cart from the bin and enter the store, pushing the cart through two sliding glass doors. \nA lone CHECKOUT LADY behind the counter, big and frumpy, looks up from counting money. \nCHECK OUT LADY You girls gonna have to hurry it up. We're under curfew. \nTATUM Two minutes tops. \nThey make a bee-line for the junk food section just as the automated doors slide shut behind them and a... \nGHOST MASKED FIGURE appears, out of nowhere, standing just outside, watching, quietly through the glass store windows. \nEXT.  POLICE STATION - SHERIFF'S OFFICE \nSheriff Burke's face heats up as Deputy Riley marches in, hurriedly. \nSHERIFF BURKE Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy? \nDEWEY Keeping my eye on Sidney. \nSHERIFF BURKE Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott--Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed. \nDEWEY Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned? \nSHERIFF BURKE There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man. \nDEWEY Have you contacted the bureau? \nSHERIFF BURKE They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning--we'll do a house to house. \nDEWEY You think he could still be in town? \nSHERIFF BURKE He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney? \nTatum leans over and, with her elbow, hits the garage door button. BRRRMM!  It begins to rise. \nShe moves towards the rising door, beer in hand.  Suddenly, CRR- BRRRM!  The garage door RESETS, reversing direction, moving down, closing. \nTATUM What the... \nTatum spins around to see.. \nA GHOST MASKED FIGURE \nSilhouetted in the dark, next to the kitchen door, his hand on the switch.  Tatum at once GASPS, taken back, but then relaxes. \nTATUM Is that you, Randy? Cute. \nThe FIGURE stares at her, blankly. \nTATUM And what movie is this from? I SPIT ON YOUR GARAGE. \nTatum takes a step towards the FIGURE. \nTATUM Lose the mask. If Sidney sees it, she'll flip. \nThe FIGURE shakes his head slowly from side to side. \nTATUM Oh, you wanna play psycho killer? \nThe FIGURE slowly nods. \nTATUM Can I be the helpless victim? \nThe FIGURE slowly nods again. \nTATUM Okay, let's see. \"No, please don't kill me, Mr. Ghostface. I want to be in the sequel.\" \nTatum takes a step to move around the FIGURE, but he steps too, blocking her. \nTATUM Cut, Casper. That's a wrap. \nTatum moves again, sidestepping the FIGURE, but he's faster and cuts her off. \nTatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and with the other pushes the FIGURE hard, knocking him aside. \nTATUM Randy--will you stop? \nBut as the FIGURE intercepts, lunging forward, grabbing her wrist hard, Tatum stumbles...beer cans hit the floor, spewing... \nTATUM You little shit. \nTatum yanks hard, releasing his hold when a flash of silver catches her eye.  She looks down, glimpsing a long sharp blade as it darts forward, cutting into her forearm... \nTatum pulls back, horrified, as the moment turns deadly serious. \nThe FIGURE advances on her--knife out, ready.  She staggers backwards, holding her bloody arm, backing into the refrigerator, SCREAMING. \nTATUM Who are you? \nThe FIGURE lashes out with the knife.  Tatum dodges it, leaping back against the fridge.  The FIGURE advances.  Instinctively, she rips the top freezer door open, BASHING the FIGURE in the face, sending him backwards, reeling. \nTatum bolts to the...CLOSED GARAGE DOOR.  In a panic, she BEATS and PULLS on it, trying to make it lift.  She eyes the FIGURE...he's recovering... \nShe goes for the pet door, dropping to the floor, diving for it...she wedges her upper body through, her head, shoulders, torso just as the... \nFIGURE pounces, grabbing hold of her feet.  Tatum goes crazy SCREAMING and KICKING trying to get through. \nEXT.  GARAGE DOOR \nTatum is half in/half out of the pet door.  She BEATS and JERKS wildly, unable to see the FIGURE on the other side... \nA true fighter, Tatum kicks hard, making direct contact with the FIGURE, knocking him away. \nShe takes the moment to pull herself through further...but she stops...stuck.  She pulls and tugs but can't move.  She listens but hears nothing.  Where did he go?  An agonizing silence.  And then... \nCRR-BRRRM!  The garage door is activated.  It begins to rise upward, taking Tatum with it.  She SCREAMS MADLY. \nTATUM NOOOOOOOO..... \nTatum's arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free herself from the door, but it moves too fast, carrying her up... \nShe looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage rafters just as her neck hits the first beam, SNAPPING instantly. \nINT.  FOYER - MINUTES LATER \nIt's getting late and SOME KIDS leave through the front door, muttering, \"parents and curfew\", etc.  The door hangs open wide. Sid moves to close it when.... \nBILLY appears in a classic fake scare. \nSIDNEY Billy? Jesus, you scared me. \nStu appears. \nSTU (with a wink) Dude. What are you doing here? \nBILLY I was hoping Sid and I could talk. \nThe camera sits on the book shelf lodged between two knickknacks, completely inconspicuous. The CAMERA WIDENS to reveal several TEENS watching the TV--the horror diehards. \nTEEN #1 Look, here it comes. SPLAT! \nTEEN #2 The blood's not the right color. Why do they do that? It's too red. \nRANDY Here comes another... \nTEEN #3 Predictable. Knew he was going to bite it. \nBORED TEEN How can you watch this shit over and over? \nRANDY Shhhhh. \nSTU I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts? \nRANDY Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit. \nBOY TEEN No way. \nRANDY That's why she always lived. Only virgins can outsmart the killer in the big chase scene in the end. Don't you know the rules? \nStu finishes his beer. \nSTU What rules? \nRandy hits the pause button on the remote and stands in front of the television, explaining. \nRANDY There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie--you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say \"I'll be right back.\" \nSTU Wanna another beer? \nRANDY Yeah. \nSTU I'll be right back. \nEverybody \"ooohhs\". \nRANDY There he goes folks--a dead man. Wave bye-bye. \nINT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS \nGale and Kenny watch the monitor.  The party is clearing out some \nA RAP at the van door.  Gale pulls it open to see Deputy Riley standing, his face all smiles. \nDEWEY Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me. \nGALE What kind of lead? \nDEWEY A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road. \nGALE I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright? \nDEWEY Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town. \nGALE Can I bring Kenny? \nDEWEY (too quickly) NO! I mean...I should probably take just you. \nGale steps out of the van turning back to Kenny. \nGALE I'll be back. \nShe slides the van door closed. \nEXT.  ROAD - CONTINUOUS \nGale heads for Dewey's patrol jeep. \nDEWEY Actually, I thought we could walk. It's not far. \nGale appears skeptical, but smiles anyway.  She's genuinely smitten by this young guy. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSCARY MUSIC fills the room.  The party is reduced to the diehards in front of the television. \nRANDY (pointing to TV) Look, here comes the obligatory tit shot. \nOTHER GUYS Beautiful! Finally! \nINT.  BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nBilly and Sidney are going at it...passionately.  He has his head buried in her neck. \nSIDNEY (to herself) \"Eight is enough to fill our lives with love...\" \nIt's working.  Sidney pushes Billy off her as she pulls her shirt over her head.  She fumbles with the clasp of her bra as the... \nCAMERA RUSHES IN on her breasts.  Just as Sid's bra straps slide of her shoulders... \nBilly moves in front of the CAMERA, pulling his jeans off, Blocking Sidney from view. \nShe unlocks the door and pushes on it.  But it won't give...she pushes on it again.  It's locked from the other side.  Shit.  She turns to the staircase. \nEXT.  DARK ROAD - CONTINUOUS \nA long, deserted country road.  In the distance, a single flashlight beams ahead, the only light in the black night.  Gale and Dewey can be heard. \nGALE So is Dewey your real name? \nDEWEY Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago. \nGALE I like it. It's... sexy. \nDEWEY Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious. \nGALE What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist... \nCLOSE ON Gale and Dewey, walking closely, side by side- flirtatiously.  Gale is surprisingly nervous. \nGALE People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism. \nDEWEY I don't think you're so bad. \nGale smiles. \nGALE Are all the local boys as sweet as you? \nDewey blushes.  He starts to say something when headlights appear behind them.  They both spin as TWO CARS loaded with KIDS come racing right at them. \nDewey grabs Gale and pushes her off the road... just as the cars speed by, oblivious to them. \nIN THE DITCH \nGale lands face up with Dewey right on top of her.  He steals a glance in her eyes before rolling off her. \nDEWEY You okay? \nSomething takes Gale's attention. \nGALE What's that? \nDewey looks to where gale points.  He finds the flashlight and aims it into the bush.  The tail end of a car is just visible. \nDEWEY Looks like a car. \nDewey helps her up and they move to it.  He shines the flashlight on the plates but it's already obvious to the CAMERA.  This is the same car we last saw Sidney's father driving away in. \nDEWEY Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car. \nGALE Sidney's father? \nDEWEY We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here? \nDewey is panicked.  He grabs Gale and they race off down the road. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRandy continues to watch TV.  He is now sloppy drunk, completely involved in the movie on the screen. \nSCARY MUSIC SWELLS, filling the room. \nRANDY (to TV) No, Jamie. Look behind you! Watch out! Behind you! \nAnd if he followed his own advice, he would see the GHOST MASKED FIGURE that stands directly behind him...knife poised. \nINT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS \nKenny finishes off a soda and crushes the can in his hand.  He tosses it to the floor when a movement from the monitor catches his eye. \nON THE MONITOR is Randy, still on the couch, engrossed in the movie.  Directly behind him...the GHOST.  Kenny does a double- take.  No fucking way.  He watches as the GHOST stands still, unmoving, knife raised. \nKENNY JESUS...FUCK... \nThe GHOST takes a silent step forward. \nKENNY (screaming at the monitor) BEHIND YOU! LOOK BEHIND YOU! \nThis kid needs help.  Kenny bolts out of his seat and goes for the side door.  He slides it open and sticks his head out as... \nA LONG, SHARP BLADE \ncomes at Kenny, fast and furious...slicing into his throat.  Kenny falls forward...out the door as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE is upon him. \nTHE CAMERA PANS TO THE MONITOR \njust in time to see the GHOST MASKED FIGURE turn away from Randy, leaving him unharmed, moving instead, out the front door, on a thirty second walk to the newsvan. \nINT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS \nThe attic is long and narrow...cluttered with furniture, boxes, and the likes...moonlight filters in through a small raised window on the front wall of the house. \nSidney moves through the attic...BUMPING into this, KNOCKING over that...she passes a dusty mirror, jumping at her own reflection. She cringes at her image, drenched in Billy's blood.  She stares long and hard...something about the blood, the redness of it.  She moves on, determined. \nShe eyes the raised window above her...a way out...if she could only reach it... \nRANDY Stu's flipped out. He's gone mad. \nSlowly, a small smile creeps across Billy's face. \nBILLY \"We all go a little mad sometimes.\" \nRandy squints, confused, as Billy aims the gun at Randy and pulls the trigger.  The BLAST throws Randy's body against the wall before sliding to a heap on the floor...still. \nBILLY Anthony Perkins--PSYCHO \nBILLY TURNS TO SIDNEY... \nWho stands only feet away, face aghast... \nFuck, no...this can't be happening.  Billy's eyes are on her, unmoving. \nHe sticks his tongue out and slowly licks the blood dried to his face...tasting it. \nBILLY Corn syrup. Same stuff they used for pig's blood in CARRIE. \nSidney is dumbfounded.  Slowly, she takes a step back, moving into the dark refines of the kitchen. \nBilly, lurches forward in a fake-out, baiting her.  She takes another step back--petrified. \nCLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE.  It is no longer familiar to Sidney.  There is something inhuman now about his features.  His expression is pure evil. \nShe takes another step back, shrinking into the dark kitchen. \nTHE CAMERA TAKES A MOMENT TO ADJUST TO THE DARKNESS as the outline of a FIGURE appears... \nSTANDING RIGHT BEHIND SIDNEY. \nShe continues to back up, moving right into the arms of... \nSTU \nSidney spins around...her mouth open in speechless horror. \nSIDNEY Stu...please...help me... \nStu stares back at her, eyes wide, lips curled in a subtle smile as he holds a small compact CELLULAR PHONE up to his face. \nSTU (whispering into phone) Surprise, Sidney. \nHis VOICE sounds affected now...the VOICE of the killer. \nSidney looks back to Billy, then to Stu, then to Billy again.  It becomes all too clear. \nShe stands between them, her mind racing, calculating... \nSHE BOLTS INTO THE LIVING ROOM \nIf for no other reason than to put space between her and them...they stand in the entryway, trapping her in. \nBILLY Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise--Stu, I believe it's your turn. \nSTU Oh yeah \nStu disappears into the kitchen. \nBILLY (to Sidney) What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost. \nSidney stands, trying hard to hold a calm resolve. \nA NOISE comes from the kitchen.  A low dragging sound.  Stu reappears from the front hall...wrestling with something...someone... \nCLOSE ON STU...he has a body in tow, he thrusts it forward and it rolls into the living room.  Sidney looks down to find... \nHER FATHER \nbound and gagged.  His eyes wide in fear, very much alive. \nSIDNEY Daddy! \nShe starts for him. \nBILLY Close enough. \nStu places the cellular phone in Mr. Prescott's shirt pocket. \nSTU Guess, I won't be needing this anymore. \nSIDNEY Why are you doing this? \nSTU It's all part of the game. \nBILLY It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE! \nSIDNEY Fuck you. \nBILLY We already played that game. You lost, remember? \nSTU You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night. \nSTU Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days--you gotta have a sequel. \nStu takes the knife and cuts at Billy. \nSIDNEY You sick fucks--you've seen one too many movies. \nBilly looks at her, bent over, crazed. \nBILLY Oh Sid, don't blame the movies...Movies don't create psychos. Movies just make psychos more creative. \nStu staggers a bit. \nSTU That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy. \nBILLY Get the gun. I'll untie Pops. \nBilly moves to Sidney's father. \nSTU Where'd you put it? \nStu is searching the foyer for the gun. \nBILLY It's on the table. \nSTU No, it's not. \nBilly hobbles over.  The gun is gone. \nBILLY Where the fuck is it? \nVOICE (off camera) Right here, asshole. \nBilly and Stu look up in unison to see... \nGALE WEATHERS-CORRESPONDENT FROM INSIDE STORY \nstanding in the front door way, gun in hand.  Her body tattered and bloody.  Her hair a mess. \nBILLY I thought she was dead. \nSTU She looked dead. Still does. \nGale holds the gun firm, in total control. \nGALE I've got an ending for you. The reporter left for dead in the newsvan comes to, stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day. \nSidney steps forward. \nSIDNEY I like that ending. \nBilly lunges at Gale, but she holds steady.  Billy and Stu eye each other. \nBILLY She can't get both of us. \nSTU Odds are--she'll miss anyway. \nIn a mad rush, they storm Gale, heading straight at her.  She pulls the trigger, but nothing happens...the safety is on. \nBilly charges forward, grabbing hold of the front door, SLAMMING IT SHUT.  It catches Gale in the face, knocking her backwards out the door.  She goes down...out. \nSTU Cool move. \nBilly steps out the front door and retrieves the gun from where Gale lays.  Then he turns back inside the house to find... \nSIDNEY GONE. \nBILLY Where'd she go? \nStu looks around, staggering now, bleeding heavily...Sidney has completely disappeared.  Only her father, bound and gagged remains in the living. \nSTU I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'. \nBILLY Where the fuck did she go? \nSuddenly, the phone RINGS.  Billy and Stu look at each other. Completely surprised.  Billy scrambles over to the phone. \nBILLY (picking up phone) Hello? \nSIDNEY (from phone) Are you alone in the house? \nBilly looks to Mr. Prescott.  The cellular phone is gone. \nBILLY You bitch--where the fuck are you? \nSIDNEY Not so fast.  We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS? \nBilly looks around the living room. \nBILLY Find her. \nBilly is fuming now...slightly staggering...and starting to lose it.  He SCREAMS at Stu who has fallen to his knees. \nBILLY FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT! \n", "test1_input": "The husband returns to the foyer finding his wife clinging to the phone. \nFATHER Where is she? \nMOTHER I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her. \nThe father upturns the living room. \nFATHER Casey! Casey! \nMOTHER Not my daughter...not my... \nThe husband grabs hold of his wife. \nFATHER Get in the car and drive down to the Mackenzie's. \nThe other throws the front door open and rushes out...the father moves through the house when a SCREAM echoes out.  That of his wife.  He tears off for the front door. \nEXT.  FRONT DOOR \nThe father rushes out the door to find his wife, on her knees, bent over, retching.  His eyes move beyond to a tree in the front yard...his stomach fails him...his dinner rises...as he bares witness to the single, most horrifying sight he'll ever see. \nThat of his only daughter as she hangs from a big oak tree...strung up...very much dead...her stomach ripped open. \nBLACKOUT! \nBEGIN MAIN TITLES \nFADE IN: \nINT.  BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT \nA teenage girl's room.  Neat and pinkish.  On the bed, amongst age- old stuffed animals lie opened school books. The CAMERA PANS to a desk against the wall where... \nSIDNEY PRESCOTT \na young girl of 17, sits, her face glued to the computer monitor in front of her.  CLOSE ON her face.  Sharp and clever with deep, lonely eyes.  She's comfortable in a plain, flannel nightgown. \nHer hands are at work, typing feverishly, when suddenly... \nCRASH-BOOM \nA noise behind her.  She turns abruptly, eyeing an open window across the room. A SCRATCHING sound.  She stands and moves toward it. \nEXT.  WINDOW \nSidney sticks her head out the window.  The late night wind hits her face as a SHADOW appears just to the left of her, a hand reaches out, grabs her and suddenly a FIGURE is on top of her... \nINT.  BEDROOM \nSid SCREAMS...pulling away from the figure...breaking free, falling back onto the floor. \nVOICE (o.c.) Hey...it's just me. \nSid looks up to see... \nBILLY LOOMIS \nA young, strapping boy of seventeen.  Handsome and alluring.  A star quarterback/ class president type of guy.  He sports a smile that could last for days. \nSIDNEY Billy? What the... \nBILLY I'm sorry. Don't hate me. \nSIDNEY What are you doing here? \nBILLY You sleep in THAT? \nBilly pulls himself through the window. \nSIDNEY (whispering) My dad's in the other room. \nBILLY I'll only stay a sec. \nSuddenly... \nThe bedroom door BURSTS open.  The doorknob catches on the open closet door behind it jamming it, holding it in place. \nVOICE (from behind door) What's going on in there? \nBilly quickly rolls out of sight behind the bed.  Sidney unjams the door to reveal... \nMR. PRESCOTT, late 40's, a severe presence.  A distracted man, nervous and pre-occupied. \nMR. PRESCOTT Are you okay? \nSIDNEY Can you knock? \nMR. PRESCOTT I heard screaming. \nSIDNEY No you didn't. \nMR. PRESCOTT No? Oh, well...I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton... \n", "test1_true": "MR. PRESCOTT ..so call if you need me. \nSIDNEY Got it. \nHe gives the bedroom a quick once over. \nMR. PRESCOTT I coulda swore I heard screaming. \nSidney distracts him, giving him a peck on the cheek. \nSIDNEY Have a good trip. \nMR. PRESCOTT Sleep tight, sweetie. \nHe gives her a wink and pulls the door closed.  Billy reappears. \nBILLY Close call. \nSIDNEY What are you doing here? \nBilly takes a flying leap and lands on the bed. \nBILLY It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window. \nSIDNEY Now that it's out of your system. \nBILLY And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you. \nSIDNEY Oh it did? \nBILLY Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid \"R\" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of...edited for television. \nSIDNEY So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would  have little bump- bump. \nBILLY No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff. \nShe snuggles up next to him, planting a kiss on his lips. Passionate and gentle.  He, however, reacts like a shark, moving on top of her, his hands everywhere as he presses into her...Sidney breaks away. \nSIDNEY Time to go, stud bucket. \nBilly sits up.  His heart isn't racing...it's POUNDING. \nBILLY See what you do to me. \nSweat has popped out all over his forehead, his breathing heavy. \nSIDNEY You know what my dad will do to you? \nBILLY I'm going...I'm going. \nHe moves to the window.  She follows, motioning to his wound. \nSIDNEY I appreciate the romantic gesture. \nShe gives him a kiss goodnight.  Sweet and simple. \nBILLY (whisper) Hey..about the sex stuff. I'm not trying to rush you. I was only half serious. \nShe kisses him again as he eases through the window. \nSIDNEY Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship? \nBILLY What's that? \nShe pulls her flannel gown open for a split second...flashing her left breast.  His mouth drops open...surprise, shock.  Their eyes meet.  They share a smile. \nSIDNEY Get outa here. \nINT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING \nCLOSE on Sidney snuggling her pillow, sleeping peacefully when... \nTHE RADIO ALARM BLASTS from the night table loud enough to wake the dead.  Sidney bolts up. \nDISC JOCKEY (from radio) ..found brutally murdered... \nCLICK.  Sidney, quick with the reflexes, shuts it off instantly. A car trunk SLAMS shut outside. \nSidney pulls herself out of bed and leans to the window just in time to see her Dad jumping in his car.  She half waves down at him but he doesn't see her.  He's as good as gone, pulling out of the driveway and disappearing down the road. \nA moment as Sidney stands at the window, staring out after him. \nEXT.  SCHOOL - MORNING \nCLOSE ON A SIGN \n\"BAYBORO HIGH SCHOOL.  HOME OF THE FIGHTING BULLDOGS\" \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a picture perfect small town school.  Old and charming.  Students come and go, moving about. Nothing unusual, except for the... \nsix police cars, four news vans, flashing cameras, and crowds and crowds of lookie-loo's gathered just off campus. \n", "test2_input": "Tatum and Sid enter with groceries.  Various FRIENDS greet them. \nTATUM Caterer's here. \nThe girls carry bags through a hallway that opens up onto an enormous kitchen.  Stu and some GUYS are leaning over the sink drinking beer through a funnel. \nTATUM That's mature. \nSTU Where you guys been? We had to start without you. \nEXT.  STU'S HOUSE - ROAD \nThe newsvan pulls up and parks unobtrusively on the side of the road a few feet down from the front yard. \nINT.  NEWSVAN \nKenny and Gale move around inside the van.  Kenny hovers over a control panel complete with video monitors. \nKENNY What's the plan? \nGALE Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities. \nKenny picks up a compact video camera the size of his fist.  He checks its battery pack. \nKENNY The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture. \nGALE What's the delay? \nKENNY About thirty seconds. \nGALE As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote. \nGale slides open the side door and steps out into the darkness, not seeing the FIGURE that stands behind her.  A hand grabs her shoulder, Gale's heart stops as she spins around to find... \nDewey, smiling, extremely pleased to see her. \nDEWEY Evening, ma'am. \nGALE Deputy...good evening. \nDEWEY What brings you out to these parts? \nGALE You never know when or where a story will break. \nDEWEY Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose. \nGALE Then what are you doing here? \nDEWEY Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out. \nGALE Mind if I join you? \nDewey considers for a whole two seconds. \nDEWEY Not at all. \nGale leans in the van, grabs the camera from  Kenny's hand, and throws it in her bag.  She gives Kenny a wink. \nINT.  KITCHEN \nCLOSE ON a microwave.  Popcorn POPS inside.  CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL... \nSid, Stu, and Tatum moving about the kitchen, preparing a junk food feast.  Other TEENS pop in and out. Randy appears amongst them.  He carries an armful of videos. \nRANDY I thought we'd make it a BLOCKBUSTER night. \nHe lets the videos splatter across the kitchen counter.  Stu and Tatum dive in. \nSTU I thought everything was checked out. \nRANDY I had 'em hid in the foreign section. \nSidney peruses the videos. \nSIDNEY THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT --How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies? \nRANDY She's the Scream Queen. \nSTU With that set of lungs--she should be. \nTATUM (to Sid) Tits--see. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - FEW MINUTES LATER \nThe party is going strong.  Ten maybe fifteen people stand, sit, lean.  Some crowd around the floor in front of the television. Randy is taking a vote. \nRANDY How many EVIL DEAD'S? (hands go up) How many HELLRAISER'S? \nHands go up.  BICKERING AD-LIB, etc. \nThe doorbell RINGS.  Stu goes for it. \nSTU I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage. \n", "test2_true": "STU (o.c.) Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY? \nThey look up the hallway to see Dewey and Gale standing in the foyer. \nTATUM Shit, Dewey! \nEveryone perks up, eyeing Gale. \nTATUM What is she doing here? \nDEWEY She's with me. I just wanted to check on things. \nThe GUYS in the room are drooling over Gale.  Including Stu. \nTATUM So you did--now leave...and take your media muff with you. \nTatum takes off for the kitchen. \nGale has quickly become the focus of the party.  All eyes are on her. \nSOME TEEN I watch your show regularly. \nSTU This must be big news to be on INSIDE STORY. \nGALE Huge. \nANOTHER TEEN Wanna interview us? \nRANDY We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly. \nSTU I can cry on cue. \nGale eyes the bookshelf above the television. \nGALE Maybe later? \nSuddenly, Gale starts to COUGH. \nGALE Can I trouble you for some water? \nSTU How 'bout a beer? Randy--get the lady a beer. \nRANDY You get it. \nGale slips the camera from her bag--hits the ON switch and holds it behind her...waiting for the right moment. \nBACK IN FOYER \nSIDNEY Have they found my father? \nDEWEY Afraid not. \nSIDNEY Should I be worried? \nDEWEY Not yet. \nINT.  KITCHEN \nTatum is alone in the kitchen.  She empties popcorn into a bowl, then pulls open the refrigerator...looks quickly, then remembers... \nShe moves through the adjoining laundry room to the... \nINT.  GARAGE \nThe kitchen door opens and light floods the darkened garage. Tatum stands in the doorway searching for a light switch. \nShe finds a button and hits it.  BRRRRMMM!  The electric garage door starts to rise.  Wrong switch.  She hits it again and it closes. \nShe finds another switch.  CLICK.  A small lightbulb overhead comes on, barely lighting the large two car garage, leaving pockets of shadows along the wall. \nTatum spots the refrigerator against a far wall and heads for it, not seeing the kitchen door, quietly, slowly, closing behind her, sealing her off from the rest of the house. \nTatum stumbles to the refrigerator and throws it open.  Its light casts a glow across her face. \nCRASH-BOOM! \nTatum jumps, spinning around just in time to see a cat escape through a large pet door that's built into the garage door.  She smiles at her jumpiness. \nTatum loads up with as many beer as her hands will carry and heads back to the kitchen. \nAt the kitchen door, she juggles the beer, reaching for the knob. It's locked. \nTATUM SHIT! \nShe KICKS it with her foot several times. \nTATUM Hey, Shitheads! \nA moment.  No answer. \nTATUM OH, SHIT PISS! \n", "test3_input": "SIDNEY APPEARS \nin the middle of the road, drenched in blood, very much resembling a young Sissy Spacek. \nGale swerves to miss her, but she turns too sharp and the van veers off the road at top speed...flipping over on its side, sliding off into the thick foliage. \nEXT.  ROAD - CONTINUOUS \nSidney races to where the van lay on it's side.  Sidney peers through the windshield...Gale's body lay limp and bloody. \nSIDNEY CRIES OUT, turning, limping to the driveway.  She sees the patrol jeep with it's open door...she goes for it. \nINT.  JEEP \nSidney hops in, reaches for the ignition...NO KEYS!  Shit.  Just then, Sidney's eyes go to the front porch.  She watches as the front door opens and a FIGURE appears in the darkness, undetectable. \nSidney throws the headlights...illuminating the front side of the house, revealing... \nDEWEY STANDING IN THE DOORWAY. \nSIDNEY DEWEY! \nSidney opens the jeep door, moving to him, noticing his body, slumped, knees buckled... \nAnd then his body falls forward, slowly, deliberately, hitting the porch hard.  Standing behind him is... \nTHE GHOST \nSIDNEY SCREAMS FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER SOUL. \nSIDNEY NOOOOOOOO!!!!! \nSid jumps back inside the jeep, closing the door, locking it.  She reaches over and locks the passenger's door and then she...waits. \nAnd watches as the GHOST leans over Dewey's still body, fumbling with something.  Then the FIGURE stands upright, in his hands he holds... \nTHE KEYS \nThey jingle in the wind, the GHOST toying with her, enjoying this... \nSidney, hysterical, locks eyes with the FIGURE as he moves to the door, Sidney leaps on it, holding the lock button down, making it impossible to unlock.  Her face is pressed against the glass...inches from the MASKED FIGURE. \nShe uses every ounce of strength when suddenly, the GHOST DISAPPEARS, dropping down, below the window, out of her view. \nSidney moves to the center of the jeep, trying hard to listen over her own RAPID BREATHING, every sound AMPLIFIED. \nThen she hears it, the soft JINGLING of keys near the passengers side door.  She pounces on the lock, holding it down. \nA shadow cuts the beam of the headlights, unseen by Sidney.  The lock turns on the other side.  Sidney leaps over and holds it down, securing it.  This is beyond nerve-racking.  Sidney is certifiable. \nHer eyes spot the police radio for the first time.  She grabs the mouthpiece and hits the switch. \nSIDNEY Help! Please! I'm at Stu Maker's house on Turner Lane. Please, HE'S GONNA KILL ME! \nEXT.  FRONT OF JEEP \nANGLE through front windshield.  Sidney RANTING into the police band.  She doesn't see the... \nGHOST FIGURE open the tailgate door of the jeep and slowly crawl in behind her. \nThe GHOST FIGURE reaches out and grabs hold of Sidney's neck. \nSidney, with surprising strength, spins around and attacks the GHOST. \nShe falls back against the dash, legs out, kicking wildly at him. \nHer hand reaches for the door, finds the lock, the door lever, she pulls... \nThe door swings open... \nSidney falls out of the door, hitting the ground. \nEXT.  FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS \nSidney, on her stomach, squirms away from the jeep.  She brings herself up to her hands and knees, looking behind her to see nothing... \nTHE GHOST HAS DISAPPEARED. \nSidney's eyes roam the yard but he's nowhere.  Completely gone. Vanished.  Sid crawls to the front porch where... \nDEWEY'S BODY LAY \nThinking quickly, precisely, she reaches to Dewey's holster and grabs his gun when a VOICE ECHO'S behind her... \nVOICE (o.c.) Sidney! \nShe turns to see Randy racing to her, limping.  He appears stone cold sober. \nRANDY Jesus, Sid. We gotta get out of here. \nSidney throws the gun forward. \nSIDNEY Stop. Right there. \n", "test3_true": "SIDNEY Don't come any closer. \nRANDY Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed...I think Stu did it. \nHe takes a step forward when another VOICE SPEAKS UP. \nVOICE (o.c.) Don't believe him, Sid. \nSidney spins around to see Stu moving up the walk. \nSTU He's lying. He killed Tatum. And Billy. \nStu moves closer to Sidney. \nSIDNEY Stay away. \nShe aims the gun in his direction. \nSTU His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho. \nRANDY Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one. \nSidney has lost it, she doesn't know who to trust.  She aims the gun at Stu..then Randy..then Stu... \nSTU Come on, Sid. Give me the gun. \nRANDY No, Sid. \nThey both move toward her.  There's no time.  She must act now. Finally... \nSIDNEY Fuck you both. \nAnd with that, Sidney steps back into the house and SLAMS the front door shut. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM / FOYER \nSid locks and bolts the door.  From the other side she can hear Randy SCREAMING. \nRANDY NO, SID. OPEN UP. PLEASE... HE'S GONE CRAZY. \nHis fists POUND against the door.  Sidney, stumbling in the darkness, rushes to the phone in the living room.  Just as she reaches for it...it RINGS.  It scares the life out of her.  She SCREAMS, yanking it up. \nSIDNEY Please! God! Help me! \nVOICE (from the phone) Having fun Sidney? \nSidney falls apart, SCREAMING. \nSIDNEY NOOOOOOOOO!!! \nShe throws the phone down, disconnecting the call. \nSid moves back to the door.  RANDY'S SCREAMS ARE MADDENING.  She eyes the lock, deliberating. \nSIDNEY (at the door) GOAWAYLEAVEMEALONE! \nCLUNK!  A NOISE UPSTAIRS. \nSidney looks up the staircase, into the darkness, her face SHOCKED to see... \nBILLY \nemerging from the shadows, stumbling down the stairs.  Very much alive. \nSIDNEY Oh God. Billy! \nHe's blood-soaked and dazed.  Sidney meets him in the landing, grabbing him, holding him... \nSIDNEY I thought you were... \nBILLY I'm alright. Gotta...get...help. \nBilly goes for the door. \nSIDNEY He's out there. \nRandy continues POUNDING ON THE DOOR, SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS. \nRANDY (through door) Please, you gotta let me in. He's gonna kill me. \nBilly goes for the door.  Sidney blocks him. \nSIDNEY NO! Don't believe him. \nBILLY It's okay. Give me the gun. \nSidney hands him the gun.  Billy turns and unlocks the door, opening it.  Randy rushes in, grabbing Billy, pleading... \nRANDY Help me... \nBILLY (calming him) Shhhh. It's okay. \n"}

That of his wife.  He tears off for the front door. \nEXT.  FRONT DOOR \nThe father rushes out the door to find his wife, on her knees, bent over, retching.  His eyes move beyond to a tree in the front yard...his stomach fails him...his dinner rises...as he bares witness to the single, most horrifying sight he'll ever see. \nThat of his only daughter as she hangs from a big oak tree...strung up...very much dead...her stomach ripped open. \nBLACKOUT! \nBEGIN MAIN TITLES \nFADE IN: \nINT.  BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT \nA teenage girl's room.  Neat and pinkish.  On the bed, amongst age- old stuffed animals lie opened school books. The CAMERA PANS to a desk against the wall where... \nSIDNEY PRESCOTT \na young girl of 17, sits, her face glued to the computer monitor in front of her.  CLOSE ON her face.  Sharp and clever with deep, lonely eyes.  She's comfortable in a plain, flannel nightgown. \nHer hands are at work, typing feverishly, when suddenly... \nCRASH-BOOM \nA noise behind her.  She turns abruptly, eyeing an open window across the room. A SCRATCHING sound.  She stands and moves toward it. \nEXT.  WINDOW \nSidney sticks her head out the window.  The late night wind hits her face as a SHADOW appears just to the left of her, a hand reaches out, grabs her and suddenly a FIGURE is on top of her... \nINT.  BEDROOM \nSid SCREAMS...pulling away from the figure...breaking free, falling back onto the floor. \nVOICE (o.c.) Hey...it's just me. \nSid looks up to see... \nBILLY LOOMIS \nA young, strapping boy of seventeen.  Handsome and alluring.  A star quarterback/ class president type of guy.  He sports a smile that could last for days. \nSIDNEY Billy? What the... \nBILLY I'm sorry. Don't hate me. \nSIDNEY What are you doing here? \nBILLY You sleep in THAT? \nBilly pulls himself through the window. \nSIDNEY (whispering) My dad's in the other room. \nBILLY I'll only stay a sec. \nSuddenly... \nThe bedroom door BURSTS open.  The doorknob catches on the open closet door behind it jamming it, holding it in place. \nVOICE (from behind door) What's going on in there? \nBilly quickly rolls out of sight behind the bed.  Sidney unjams the door to reveal... \nMR. PRESCOTT, late 40's, a severe presence.  A distracted man, nervous and pre-occupied. \nMR. PRESCOTT Are you okay? \nSIDNEY Can you knock? \nMR. PRESCOTT I heard screaming. \nSIDNEY No you didn't. \nMR. PRESCOTT No? Oh, well...I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton... \n", "test1_true": "MR. PRESCOTT ..so call if you need me. \nSIDNEY Got it. \nHe gives the bedroom a quick once over. \nMR. PRESCOTT I coulda swore I heard screaming. \nSidney distracts him, giving him a peck on the cheek. \nSIDNEY Have a good trip. \nMR. PRESCOTT Sleep tight, sweetie. \nHe gives her a wink and pulls the door closed.  Billy reappears. \nBILLY Close call. \nSIDNEY What are you doing here? \nBilly takes a flying leap and lands on the bed. \nBILLY It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window. \nSIDNEY Now that it's out of your system. \nBILLY And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you. \nSIDNEY Oh it did? \nBILLY Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid \"R\" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of...edited for television. \nSIDNEY So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would  have little bump- bump. \nBILLY No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff. \nShe snuggles up next to him, planting a kiss on his lips. Passionate and gentle.  He, however, reacts like a shark, moving on top of her, his hands everywhere as he presses into her...Sidney breaks away. \nSIDNEY Time to go, stud bucket. \nBilly sits up.  His heart isn't racing...it's POUNDING. \nBILLY See what you do to me. \nSweat has popped out all over his forehead, his breathing heavy. \nSIDNEY You know what my dad will do to you? \nBILLY I'm going...I'm going. \nHe moves to the window.  She follows, motioning to his wound. \nSIDNEY I appreciate the romantic gesture. \nShe gives him a kiss goodnight.  Sweet and simple. \nBILLY (whisper) Hey..about the sex stuff. I'm not trying to rush you. I was only half serious. \nShe kisses him again as he eases through the window. \nSIDNEY Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship? \nBILLY What's that? \nShe pulls her flannel gown open for a split second...flashing her left breast.  His mouth drops open...surprise, shock.  Their eyes meet.  They share a smile. \nSIDNEY Get outa here. \nINT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING \nCLOSE on Sidney snuggling her pillow, sleeping peacefully when... \nTHE RADIO ALARM BLASTS from the night table loud enough to wake the dead.  Sidney bolts up. \nDISC JOCKEY (from radio) ..found brutally murdered... \nCLICK.  Sidney, quick with the reflexes, shuts it off instantly. A car trunk SLAMS shut outside. \nSidney pulls herself out of bed and leans to the window just in time to see her Dad jumping in his car.  She half waves down at him but he doesn't see her.  He's as good as gone, pulling out of the driveway and disappearing down the road. \nA moment as Sidney stands at the window, staring out after him. \nEXT.  SCHOOL - MORNING \nCLOSE ON A SIGN \n\"BAYBORO HIGH SCHOOL.  HOME OF THE FIGHTING BULLDOGS\" \nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a picture perfect small town school.  Old and charming.  Students come and go, moving about. Nothing unusual, except for the... \nsix police cars, four news vans, flashing cameras, and crowds and crowds of lookie-loo's gathered just off campus. \n", "test1_id": 42, "test2_input": "RANDY (to Stu) Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox. \nTATUM (eyeing Sidney) Randy, you goon-fuck, I'm eating here. \nStu nibbles at Tatum's neck. \nSTU Yeah, Randy, she's getting mad. I think you better liver alone. \nStu cracks up at his own joke.  The others just MOAN.  Sidney is about to crawl out of her skin, trying hard to ignore it all. \nEXT.  SIDNEY'S HOUSE - LATER \nA huge two story country home with a spacious lawn. \nA yellow school bus stops in front of the house and Sidney steps off. \nThe house looks big and lonely as Sidney moves up the walk to the front door. \nINT.  BEDROOM - LATER \nSidney is on the telephone. \nSIDNEY (into phone) You sure I can stay over?  My dad won't be back til Sunday. \nTATUM (through phone) No prob. I'll pick you up after practice. \nSIDNEY Tell your mom I said thanks. \nTATUM Yeah, yeah...are you okay? \nSIDNEY Uh-huh, it's just...you know, the police and reporters...it brings it all back. \nTATUM I'll be there by seven. I promise \nSIDNEY Thanks, Tatum. \nTATUM Later. \nSidney hangs up.  She takes a seat at her computer and boots it up.  She sits in front of it staring at the blue screen...her own reflection staring back. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER \nSidney comes down the stairs, her arms carrying a change of clothes, toothbrush, make-up... \nShe opens the hall closet and pulls a small overnight bag from the top shelf.  Moving into the living room she loads it up, plopping down on the sofa, hitting the TV remote. \nCLOSE ON THE SCREEN \nA news reporter fades in. \nREPORTER #1 (on TV) The entire nation was shocked today by the teen murders in North Carolina... \nSidney switches channels. \nREPORTER #2 The State Bureau of Investigation has joined forces with local authorities to help catch what the Governor has called the most heinous... \nThe channel switches again.  Gale weathers appears, standing in front of the school.  Her white teeth gleaming. \nGALE This is not the first time the small town of Bayboro has endured such tragedy. Only a year ago, Maureen Prescott, wife and mother, was found raped and murdered... \nAn old black and white snapshot fills the screen-a woman, beautiful and familiar. \nCLOSE ON SIDNEY \neyes frozen, mesmerized by the image.  Suddenly she CLICKS the TV off.  Her eyes go to the clock on the end table.  5:45 PM.  Her eyes then move to the framed photo next to it...the same black and white photo stares at her...a healthy, vibrant woman.  An older version of Sidney. \nSidney curls up on the sofa closing her eyes tight... \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER \nThe clock on the end table reads 7:15 PM.  Sidney is fast asleep on the couch.  The phone RINGS.  Sidney leaps up grabbing the portable phone. \nTATUM (from phone) Practice ran late. I'm on my way. \nSIDNEY (eyes clock) It's past seven. \nTATUM Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten. \nSIDNEY I'm not worried. \nTATUM Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis. \nSIDNEY Whatever. Just hurry. \nTATUM Bye. \nShe hangs up the phone.  It immediately RINGS again. \nSIDNEY (into phone) Tatum? \nMAN'S VOICE (from phone) Hello, Sidney. \nIT'S HIM.  THE VOICE FROM BEFORE. \n", "test2_true": "MAN You tell me. \nSidney thinks, trying to place his voice.  It sounds a little distorted. \nSIDNEY I have no idea. \nMAN Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something. \nSIDNEY Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over. \nMAN Do you like scary movies, Sidney? \nSIDNEY I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy. \nMAN What's your favorite scary movie? \nSIDNEY Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit. \nMAN And why is that? \nSIDNEY (playing along) Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl-who can't act-who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous. \nA brief silence. \nMAN Are you alone in the house? \nSIDNEY That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy. \nMAN Maybe that's because I'm not Randy. \nSIDNEY So who are you? \nMAN The question is not who am I. The question is where am I? \nSIDNEY So where are you? \nMAN Your front porch. \nThis gives her pause.  She moves to the window and pulls aside the drapes. \nSIDNEY Why would you call me from my front porch? \nMAN That's the original part. \nANGLE THROUGH WINDOW.  She can't quite see all of the porch. \nSIDNEY Oh yeah? Well I call your bluff. \nSidney goes to the front door.  She unlocks the bolt, unsnags the chain, and pulls the door open...revealing the front porch... \nCOMPLETELY EMPTY. \nShe steps out onto it, phone still in hand.  A single light shines overhead illuminating the porch, but little beyond.  Darkness is all around. \nSIDNEY So where are you? \nMAN Right here. \nSidney peers out into the darkness past thick shrubs that grow on either side of the porch. \nSIDNEY Can you see me right now? \nMAN Uh-huh. \nSIDNEY What am I doing? \nShe sticks her finger up her nose, pretending to pick.  Silence. No answer. \nSIDNEY Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now. \nMAN If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother. \nSidney stops dead in her tracks, speechless. \nMAN (deadly) Do you want to die, Sidney? Your mother didn't. \nHis seriousness unnerves her.  Sid flies off the handle. \nSIDNEY FUCK YOU! YOU CRETIN! \nShe hangs up on him.  Moves back inside the house.  Locks, chains, and bolts the door when... \nA FIGURE COMES LEAPING OUT OF THE HALL CLOSET \nrushing her, ramming into her side..the phone flies..the FIGURE is on top of her as she goes down...SCREAMING... \nShe looks up to see the FIGURE, darkly dressed with a pale, distorted face, white and ghostly...a mask. \nHer instincts surface and she kicks up with her foot making the contact with his leg...he topples over...coming right at her, his hand finding her neck.  Suddenly, along, silver blade appears above her. \nSidney pulls, jerks, twists...finally she lifts her torso forward knocking the FIGURE off her...sending him reeling into the living room.  Wasting no time, Sidney leaps to her feet. \n", "test2_id": 43, "test3_input": "But there's doubt in her voice.  Gale's face lights up. \nGALE You're not so sure anymore, are you? \nSidney clams up. \nSIDNEY No, it was Cotton. \nTatum comes waltzing up. \nTATUM (to GALE) Nice welt. \nGale ignores her, zeroing in on Sidney, half realizing. \nGALE The killer is still on the loose, isn't he? These murders are related. \nTATUM Yo--let's rock. \nSidney starts to fidget. \nSIDNEY I'm sorry I mangled your face. \nShe take off with Tatum.  Gale calls after her. \nGALE Wait, Sidney, don't go... \nBut Sidney and Tatum have already disappeared in the crowd of students moving across campus. \nGale looks to Kenny. \nGALE Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming. \nKENNY You want to go live? \nGale's mind races with possibilities. \nGALE No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete. \nKENNY When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge. \nGALE If I'm gonna blow this up-I need hard proof. \nKENNY But it's so much easier when we make it up. \nGALE Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty. \nEXT.  SCHOOL CAMPUS - SECONDS LATER \nTatum and Sidney make their way across campus. \nTATUM Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here. \nSIDNEY But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now. \nThey move up the walk as a FIGURE falls in step behind them, sporting a WHITE GHOST MASK. \nTATUM Serial killers are smart by definition. They minimize their risk. They plan and pre-calculate everything. Showing up here would be the most lame-brain move he could make. \nSIDNEY He promised me he'd be back. \nAs easy as the figure appeared, it disappears-falling out of site, unseen by either of them. \nTATUM I wouldn't put too much stock in a psycho's promise. \nThey move up the front steps toward the main doors of the school as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE reappears...standing at the top of the steps...Sidney sees it first, stopping dead in her tracks. \nShe steps back, spinning around to find... \nA GHOST FACE behind her as well, both of them approaching, closing in on her.  Sidney starts to SCREAM when the two ghosts bust up LAUGHING, tearing off across campus. \nEXT.  STREET \nIn front of the school we catch up a REPORTER doing a live remote. He holds a mask in his hand. \nREPORTER This morning several students, in what appears to be a prank, have been spotted wearing masks. School officials have yet to comment but this is the same type of mask worn by the killer... \nINT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER \nJust before the bell.  The hallway is congested with students heading to class.  Tatum is at her locker with Sidney. \nSIDNEY This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here. \nTATUM I want you to meet me here right after class, okay? \nBilly appears in the crowd, with Stu tagging behind.  Tatum spots him first. \nTATUM Shit, what is he doing here? \nSIDNEY I bet he's pissed. \nTATUM Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did. \nBilly and Stu approach.  Billy's face is solemn. \n", "test3_true": "Sidney says nothing.  She can barely look at him.  Tatum intervenes. \nTATUM You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school. \nSTU Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it. \nBILLY Talk to me, Sid. \nSuddenly, a SCREAM erupts.  All eyes go to a GHOST MASKED STUDENT running down the hall, screaming wildly, running amuck. \nSIDNEY Why are they doing this? \nSTU Are you kidding? This is like Christmas. \nBilly punches Stu in the side. \nSTU Owwww... \nBILLY You open your mouth and stupidity pours out. \nSTU Sorry. \nSidney, clearly upset, takes off down the hall.  Billy races off after her. \nTATUM (yelling) Stay away from her, Billy. \nTatum SLAMS her locker door shut as the bell RINGS. \nINT.  CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER \nWith first period underway, the halls have cleared.  One or two struggling students can be seen rushing to class. \nSidney moves quickly down the hall, rounding a corner, running smack into... \nBILLY \nThey collide hard catching Sidney off guard, scaring the life out of her.  She falls backwards, but Billy catches her fall. \nSIDNEY Jesus, SHIT! \nBILLY Hey, hey, it's just me. \nSidney pulls away from him quickly.  Billy feels the slight. \nBILLY What? You don't still think it's me? \nSidney catches her breath. \nSIDNEY No...I don't...it's just...Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me. \nBILLY The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid. \nSIDNEY I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house. \nBILLY See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember? \nSIDNEY I'm so sorry...please understand. \nBILLY Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me. \nSIDNEY You know that's not true. \nBILLY Then what is it? Is there somebody else? \nSIDNEY No... \nBILLY Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy? \nSIDNEY No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom. \nBILLY It's been a year since she died. \nSIDNEY (correcting him) Tomorrow. One year tomorrow. \nBILLY When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad--I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back. \nSIDNEY (sharply) Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere. \nBILLY You have to move on, Sid. \nSidney starts to walk away but turns back, angry. \nSIDNEY I'm glad to know you're coping so well with life, Billy. But some of us aren't so perfect. Some of us are just trying to hold on. \nSidney disappears through a door marked GIRL'S BATHROOM, leaving Billy alone in the hallway.  He SMACKS his forehead, pissed at himself. \nINT.  GIRL'S BATHROOM \nLarge and spacious.  Closed bathroom stalls line one wall facing a row of sinks and a huge mirror.  Sidney enters as TWO GIRLS tinkle and talk--each from their respective stalls. \nGIRL #1 She was never attacked. I think she made it all up. \n", "test3_id": 44}

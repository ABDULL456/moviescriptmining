Kristoff rides Sven as they follow the trail of ice. 
YOUNG KRISTOFF Faster, Sven! 
EXT. THE VALLEY OF THE LIVING ROCK -- NIGHT 
Kristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley. They hide behind a rock and peek out. 
Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa. The Queen holds the still unconscious Anna. 
KING Please, help. My daughter! 
Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward them. It looks as though they'll be crushed! 
But, luckily, the rocks stop at their feet. The rocks then unfold, revealing bright faces. 
YOUNG KRISTOFF Trolls...? 
The rock in front of Kristoff "wakes up." Meet BULDA. 
BULDA Shush. I'm trying to listen. 
She grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them close. Sven licks her face and she eyes them both. 
BULDA (CONT'D) Cuties. I'm gonna keep you. 
Back below, the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth. They call him GRAND PABBIE. He approaches arthritically, but determined. He nods respectfully to the king. 
GRAND PABBIE Your Majesty. (referring to Elsa) Born with the powers or cursed? 
KING Born. And they're getting stronger. 
Grand Pabbie motions for the Queen to bring Anna to him. She does. He examines her. FROZEN - J. Lee 
GRAND PABBIE (about Anna) You are lucky it wasn't her heart. The heart is not so easily changed, but the head can be persuaded. 
KING Do what you must. 
GRAND PABBIE I recommend we remove all magic, even memories of magic to be safe.... But don't worry, I'll leave the fun. 
Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Anna's head. We see her memories floating right above her. Grand Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the girls in winter gear. He puts the ordinary memories back in her head. 
GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D) She will be okay. 
YOUNG ELSA But she won't remember I have powers? 
KING It's for the best. 
PABBIE Listen to me, Elsa, your power will only grow. 
As he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes. 
PABBIE (CONT'D) There is beauty in your magic.... But also great danger. 
The snowflakes turn to sharp spikes. 
PABBIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) You must learn to control it. 
In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human figures to panic and attack Elsa. 
PABBIE (CONT'D) Fear will be your enemy. FROZEN - J. Lee 
Elsa gasps and buries her face in the King's chest. The King wraps his arms around Elsa, protectively. 
KING No. We'll protect her. She can learn to control it. I'm sure. 
Over the King's words we... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
-The Arendelle castle gates shutting. 
KING (O.S.) (CONT'D) Until then, we'll lock the gates. We'll reduce the staff. We will limit her contact with people and keep her powers hidden from everyone... including Anna. 
-The castle shutters close. 
-Anna sits on her bed as Elsa's furniture disappears. 
-Anna rushes to the hall to see Elsa shut the door to her new room. Anna watches, confused and sad. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CASTLE WINDOW -- DAY 
We look out on a gentle snowfall. Little Anna skips up to the window. She lights up at the sight of the snow and rushes down the hall. 
INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR -- DAY 
Anna knocks on Elsa's door and SINGS.

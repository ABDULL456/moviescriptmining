INT. THE GIRL'S BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER. 
The SCHOOL NURSE, HELGA HAUPTFÜHRER, 55 and very Aryan, enters the empty bathroom and walks into a stall. 
MINI (V.O.) The school nurse, a regimented Kraut lush named Helga Hauptführer, or "der Führer" as she was affectionately known, starts jonesing for her afternoon nip... I NT. THE STALL - CONTINUOUS 
Hauptführer sits down and takes a bottle of vodka out of her nurses coat. 
MINI (V.O.) ...exactly 45 minutes after lunch each day. 
She takes a long slug. 
INT. THE NURSE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Mini quickly picks the flimsy lock on the medicine cabinet with a paper clip. She quickly looks through the bottles. 
MINI (V.O.) Which leaves me free to help myself to the candy store. 
Mini finds what she needs and holds it up to read the label. 
CLOSE ON: THE LABEL indicating "RITALIN" and the dosage. 
Mini quickly closes the cabinet, walks out and stuffs the bottle in her pocket, just before Hauptführer enters. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MINI (V.O.) Thank god for the quack who invented ADD and the lazy parents willing to let "Der Führer" keep their kids comfortably numb on what basically amounts to legalized speed. 
INT. THE TANNEN'S KITCHEN - EVENING 
Mini stands at the counter, making her mom A MARGARITA. She's cutting up all kinds of tropical fruits and putting them into a blender. 
MINI (V.O.) My fears of mom giving up the sauce were unfounded. Actually, she started drinking more. 
She then takes a few tablets of Ritalin and grinds them up with their coffee grinder. She pours that into the blender and puts the lid on. 
MINI (V.O.) Which gave me the perfect opportunity to prescribe her a little pick-me-up. 
She turns on the blender. 
INT. DIANE'S DRESSING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER. 
Diane's getting dressed for a party, trying to gracefully camouflage her cast with jewelry. 
DIANE (annoyed) Mini! I asked you for that drink ten minutes ago! 
Mini walks in, carrying the margarita. D IANE Put it on the counter. 
MINI You're welcome. 
Diane takes a pain killer and washes it down with the margarita. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DIANE Mmm...this is really good. What's in it, Sweetie? 
MINI (V.O.) The first time in my life she calls me "sweetie" and I've just slipped her the mother of all Mickeys. 
MINI Oh, this and that. 
INT. A POSH PARTY IN THE HILLS - NIGHT 
The party is chock full of TROPHY WIVES and their decidedly less attractive HUSBANDS. Diane is in a full blown booze and Ritalin induced monologue, having cornered TWO WOMEN. 
DIANE My god, let me tell you, breaking my hand on that bitch's face... 
The two women recoil. 
DIANE ...was the best thing that ever happened to me. 
MINI (V.O.) Phase three: rambling incoherent monologues in public. 
DIANE I feel fantastic, just fabulous. I mean, I feel like I could run a marathon like that Bruce Jenner guy. He did that, right? Boy, I'll tell you before he had that face lift that made him look like a drag queen, I would've let him stick his javelin in me any day. 
Suddenly, her ears unconsciously pick up the strands of a conversation going on behind them between TWO HUSBANDS. 
HUSBAND #1 So I looked each and every juror in the eye- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
DIANE (spinning around) I want to talk to you about juries, will you come and talk to me about juries? 
HUSBAND #1 Uh... 
DIANE I'd like to be on a jury and say "guilty!" or "sidebar!" What do you think goes on in all the sequestered situations? Do you think any of the jurors have sex with each other? I was once on an episode of Love Boat, playing the role of "Bikini Girl" and my line was "I'll have another," it was with "Isaac" at the pool bar. I had to suck one of the associate producers off to get the line, but it got me my SAG card, so I guess it was worth it. T he men shoot each other an uncomfortable glance. 
HUSBAND #2 Uh, I think I could use a refill.

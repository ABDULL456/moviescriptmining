WILL (CONT'D) You know what I want. You're just not going to give it to me. Koba puts out a palm. There's A LOOK IN HIS EYE, MALEVOLENT, 
DISQUIETING. 
AND SOMETHING ELSE: HIS EYES HAVE CHANGED. THEY LOOK 
SOMEWHAT LIKE CAESAR'S - GREENER, LESS SIMIAN... 
WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D) What do you think of Koba? 
INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY 
We look through cage bars at Will and Franklin, who stand far away, across the room. 
FRANKLIN You wanna know if I think the 113's making him nuts. 
WILL I know he's smart. But there's something else, something worrisome. He challenges me. Taunts me. Will looks toward us, toward the bars. 
WILL (CONT'D) (almost to himself) I don't want to try it on... 
(CATCHES HIMSELF) .I don't want to start human trials if there's any chance of danger. 
FRANKLIN What you're seeing has nothing to do with the 113, Doc. The apes're just like us - they're complex. Some are loyal, some are selfish, some have a good sense of humor. And some are born rotten. Koba moves into frame. We've been watching from his point of view, from inside the cage. Now we look over his shoulder, where the sharp planes of his â¢ face frame the two men across the room. 
FRANKLIN (CONT'D) This one's a bad apple, that's all. A chill runs down Will's spine. 
EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES/MAIN GATE - DAY 
A car pulls up to the gate. Evans is driving. He looks ill. 
GUARD 
(OPENING GATE) Early day today, Evans? 
EVANS Actually I'm not feeling too good. 
EVANS GETS A SHIVER. 
GUARD You know what: Whiskey, lemon, honey and a cup of hot water. Never fails. 
EVANS Thanks - I'm on it. Evans drives off. 
EXT. PADDOCK - DAY 
Stewart sits atop one of the ranch horses, looking down at the chimpanzee area. She watches CAESAR walking across the bridge. Caesar moves easily among the apes, his Alpha Male status clear as the others make way for him. Stewart's relieved - and a little surprised - to see Caesar so at ease with the other apes. 
INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY 
ROCKET'S MISERABLE. Dodge and Rodney watch him through the bars. 
RODNEY Still won't eat, won't come out. 
DODGE I can fix that. Dodge drags the hose to Rocket's cage. 
DODGE (CONT'D) Get that monkey ass out of there! 
INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY 
Caesar watches Dodge BLAST Rocket with WATER. Rocket doesn't struggle, doesn't fight back. The harsh jet pelts his back. 
INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT 
Rocket sleeps. The FEEDER BIN OPENS AND SHUTS, waking him. Tentatively, Rocket peers inside the bin: A COOKIE. Never seen a cookie before. Rocket picks it up. Smells it. Takes a taste. Wow. He gobbles it down. At that moment Rocket's CAGE DOOR OPENS. Caesar stands holding a LARGE BAG OF CHIPS AHOY. He tosses a cookie to Rocket. Beckons him out of the cage. 
INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - NIGHT 
Rocket exits warily, on his guard for anything... But Caesar simply stands with the cookie bag. No gorilla. No shovel. He hands the cookie bag to Rocket. Rocket watches - confused - as CAESAR PULLS THE MAIN LEVER, 
OPENING ALL THE CAGES AT ONCE. CHIMPS EMERGE, bewildered. Rocket stands with the cookie bag, unsure what to do. Caesar makes a motion with his hand. Now Rocket understands. He gives a cookie to the nearest chimp. Then another one. Then another. The chimps go crazy for the cookies. THEY GATHER AROUND 
ROCKET, WHO PROUDLY DISTRIBUTES THEM. A TRANSFORMATIVE

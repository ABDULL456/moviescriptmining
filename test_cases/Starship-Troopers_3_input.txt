Carl points out Dizzy, talking with friends. 
JOHNNY Did you read her mind ? 
CARL Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss. 
It's true. You can tell by the way she looks at Johnny. 
JOHNNY Yeah, but I want Carmen. 
CARL You got it bad. 
Carmen returns to Johnny as Carls heads off. 
CARL Don't forget about this afternoon. (to Carmen) He's always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss. 
Carmen blushes, covers. CARMEN She's flying starships ! 
JOHNNY Who ? 
CARMEN Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical 
JOHNNY I have good reflexes. 
Carmen notices the way Dizzy's looking at Johnny, doesn't like it one bit, takes Johnny's arm. 
CARMEN C'mon Johnny, we'll be late for Biology. 
9	INT	BIOLOGY LAB  -- DAY - THE BIOLOGY TEACHER 
is an older woman, very spry, also blind. Johnny, Carmen and other students gather around covered lab tables. 
BIOLOGY TEACHER For our final today, please identify the mouthparts, the abdominal organs, and for extra credit, locate the nerve cord and count the ganglia. You may begin. 
The students remove the cover to reveal large alien bugs, 60 centimeter ARKELLIAN SAND BEETLES laid out for dissection. 
CARMEN Eeuch ! 
JOHNNY Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug. 
BIOLOGY TEACHER Just a bug, eh ? We humans like to think we are Nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't true. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many ways. It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of society. 
JOHNNY Better put your goggles on. 
Johnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser. Green fluid sprays from the slit. Carmen turns away looking ill. 
BIOLOGY TEACHER Our galaxy is teaming with insect life. We have identified over two billion species so far. Human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly. 
CARMEN But we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented art, mathematics and interstellar travel. 
BIOLOGY TEACHER True, we know of no insect society that has produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a Cherynkov, but before you let that go to your head, take the example of the Arachnids, a highly organized, highly evolved insect society. 
She points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a common ant and ends with a two meter tall ARACHNID WARRIOR. 
BIOLOGY TEACHER They are relatively stupid by human standards. Workers have an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the Arachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years of evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the biological means to hurl their spore into space. 
Johnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity open with aresounding crack. Bug guts gush out. 
JOHNNY Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal... 
CARMEN Excuse me...! 
She heads for the door, hand over her mouth. 
10	EXT	CIVIC PARK - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN 
walk home from school together. 
JOHNNY 35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers. 
CARMEN Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing. 
JOHNNY Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math. 
CARMEN Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers. 
JOHNNY Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ? 
CARMEN I don't want everyone to see. 
JOHNNY Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ? 
CARMEN How come that's all you talk about anymore ? 
JOHNNY It's all I think about anymore. 
Indeed, they are all alone now. The look in Johnny's eye says how about it. Carmen grins, reaches for Johnny's hand.

Judith leaves without looking back. \nNORMAN (CONT'D) I just can't find anyone that wants it. Another hopeful candidate arrives opposite Norman. And looks crestfallen at what's on offer. \n8 INT/EXT. BEDROOM/STAIRS/HALL. FAMILY HOUSE - DAY 8 \nMADGE is in her bedroom. She's arguing with her son-in-law CRAIG. Madge's suitcases are by the door. \nCRAIG This is crazy. You're crazy. You can't just up and leave like this. \nMADGE And yet if you watch me, that's exactly what you'll see happen. She picks up her suitcases, heads out of the room. Madge's daughter JESSICA is on the landing. \nJESSICA What's going on? \nCRAIG Your mother's lost it. \nJESSICA My mother never had it. \nCRAIG Talk to her. She doesn't listen to me. \nMADGE Nobody listens to you. She heads down the stairs. Craig and Jessica follow. \nMADGE (CONT'D) \n(TO JESSICA) It's one of the great mysteries of life that someone so vibrant and fascinating as my daughter should choose to spend her life with this fraction of a man. \nJESSICA I still don't understand what's going on. \nCRAIG I just asked her to babysit. And now she says she's leaving. They're at the bottom of the stairs. Jessica's children, LIAM and KATIE, are watching. \nJESSICA But you love babysitting. \nMADGE I loved it last night. \nLIAM We had pizza and stayed up late. \nMADGE And the night before. \nKATIE We had Chinese and stayed up late. \nLIAM If you don't go, tonight we could do a curry. \nMADGE It's tempting, my darlings, but you know why I must leave. \nLIAM We know. \nKATIE (to her parents) Being here is stopping her finding a husband. \nCRAIG Another one? \nLIAM AND KATIE Bye Granny. \nMADGE Don't let the buggers get you down. Madge turns to go. \nCRAIG How many husbands have you had, anyway? She turns back, smiles. \nMADGE Including my own? Then she's out of the front door, and heading for the taxi. \nJESSICA Mother? Mother! \n9 INT/EXT. TAXI - DAY 9 \nMoments later. Madge climbs into the back of the cab. \nTAXI DRIVER Name the place, darling. Where are you going? Madge smiles. \nMADGE I have absolutely no idea. \n10 INT. MANSION FLAT - DAY 10 \nEvelyn, whom we saw earlier on the phone, is in the living room. Her son CHRISTOPHER is there. And her lawyer \nHAROLD. \nCHRISTOPHER There's no other way There just isn't. Harold told us this three months ago. \nHAROLD And I'm afraid matters have only got worse. \n8A. \nCHRISTOPHER We can't wait any longer. We need to put this flat on the market, and at least make a start at paying off Dad's debts. \n", "test1_true": "CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) I've talked it through with Polly and the boys, and of course we all agreed. Ma will move in with us. \nHAROLD I think that's best, Evelyn. It's what Hugh would've wanted. They wait for confirmation from Evelyn. None comes. \nCHRISTOPHER Good. Settled. End of discussion. \nEVELYN That's what your father used to say. \nCHRISTOPHER \nMA - \nEVELYN When there'd never really been any discussion at all. \nCHRISTOPHER I want to look after things for you. \nEVELYN Like he did for forty years \nCHRISTOPHER Yes. \nEVELYN And look how that turned out. She turns to Harold \nEVELYN (CONT'D) How can any of us know what Hugh would've wanted? And would he have seen fit to tell us anyway? \n(BEST) Obviously the flat has to be sold. (Best, then to Christopher) And you're very kind. And dear Polly. But no, I won't be coming to live with you. \n9A. \n11 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 11 \nMuriel has now been transferred to a ward. She is listening to DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR. \nDR GHUJARAPARTIDAR You need a new hip, Mrs Donnelly. It's not a difficult operation. \nMURIEL Easy for you to say, you're not having it. \nDR GHUJARAPARTIDAR Regardless. You do need a new hip. \nMURIEL I'm not getting it from you. \n2nd Green Revisions I0/01/11 10. \nDR GHUJARAPARTIDAR Not me personally, no. \nMURIEL Not any of your lot. \nDR GHUJARAPARTIDAR I see. \nMURIEL So when do I have the operation? \nDR GHUJARAPARTIDAR I'm afraid you'll be on a waiting list for at least six months. \nMURIEL At my age, I can't plan that far ahead. I don't even buy green bananas. \nDR GHUJARAPARTIDAR There is another way. Our hospital trust is funding a new pilot scheme, that will enable us to out-source you to another hospital, where they can perform the procedure almost immediately, and at a fraction of the cost. \nMURIEL Is it local? \nDR GHUJARAPARTIDAR That depends how you define local. \n12 INT. EVELYN'S FLAT/CHRISTOPHER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 12 \nEvelyn is on the phone to her son Christopher. They're both sitting at computers. Evelyn's new-found dexterity is impressive. Around Evelyn's room are packing boxes, some already full. \nCHRISTOPHER \n(ON PHONE) When did you get a computer? \nEVELYN How far along is the progress bar? The strip at the bottom that tells you - \nCHRISTOPHER I know what it is. What are you showing me anyway? \nThe webpage has come up. It's a picture of a beautiful old building. And underneath is written 'THE BEST EXOTIC \nMARIGOLD HOTEL'. As Christopher gapes in horror, he hears a mellifluous Indian voice. \nINDIAN VOICE 'Come and spend your autumn years in an Indian palace with the sophistication of an English country manor. Steeped in the tradition of the Raj, tucked away on the outskirts of Jaipur .' \n13 INT. INTERNET CAFE - DAY 13 \n", "test1_id": 267, "test2_input": "Evelyn arrives at her room, goes on in. The room is light and airy. And rather nice. But all the furniture is covered in sheets. As Evelyn stands there, Sonny comes rushing in, yanks all the sheets off, and runs out again. \n38 EXT/INT. BEDROOMS/TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 38 \nMuriel wheels herself towards her room. Standing inside is a male nurse, AJIT. Muriel swivels her chair around. Graham is just going into his room. \nMURIEL There's an Indian in there! Graham smiles, goes on into his room. Which is dusty, but comfortable and pleasant. He looks around with satisfaction. \n39 EXT. STAIRWAY, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 39 \nNorman is laboriously climbing the stairs to his room. He stops, catches his breath. \n40 EXT. TERRACE, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 40 \nAjit is attempting to explain himself to Muriel. \nMURIEL My what? \nAJIT Your physiotherapist. To help with your recovery after the operation. \nMURIEL You're not touching me. \nAJIT Traditionally that is how physiotherapy is practised. \n41 EXT. ROOF, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 41 \nNorman comes out onto the roof of the hotel. His room is right in front of him, a kind of penthouse cabin. A bed, but not much else. The trees poke in through the open window. He walks through the room, hangs his battery radio on a hook and leans out of the balcony, surveying the view. \nNORMAN This'll do. \n42 INT. RECEPTION - DAY 42 \nJean is confronting Sonny. \nJEAN I want to stay at the other hotel, the one in the brochure. \nSONNY Mrs Ainslie, prepare to be amazed. This is that very building! \nJEAN You've Photoshopped it! \nSONNY I have offered a vision of the future. \n(MORE) \nSONNY (CONT'D) Of course I had hoped that by now it would be the present. But in India we have a saying: everything will be alright in the end. So if it is not alright, then it is not yet the end. \nJEAN What will start to make this alright is for you to give us a refund. \nSONNY Of course if that is what you desire, you must have it. Absolutely no problem, I will refund you completely. \nJEAN You will? Straight away? \nSONNY Without question, Mrs Ainslie, I most definitely will. Straight away in three months. \n43 INT. GRAHAM'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 43 \nGraham is taking some things out of his bag: an old map of Jaipur, sepia-tinted photographs of a British family during the Raj, official documents yellowing with age. He picks up a photograph, looks at it. From outside, we can hear Ajit, the physiotherapist \nAJIT (O.S.) a stay of five days and it is done under general anaesthesia. A hip replacement usually takes only two hours \n44 EXT. TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 44 \nAjit's explanation continues. Muriel is trying not to panic. \nAJIT Your surgeon will remove the top end of the thigh bone, and insert an artificial bone instead. A most routine procedure. \nMURIEL Have you got a marker pen on you? \nAJIT Why? \nMURIEL I want to mark it. So you don't take the wrong hip. \n45 EXT. UPPER VERANDAH.

Evelyn is watching. \nDOUGLAS (CONT'D) Now, did you try jiggling it a bit? \nEVELYN Yes, did that. \nDOUGLAS Did you kind of bang it lightly on the desk a few times? \nEVELYN That too. \nDOUGLAS Hmm. He twists off the mouthpiece of the receiver, lifts the receiver carefully. And blows on it. \nEVELYN How did you come to be here? In India. \nDOUGLAS I invested our - well, my - retirement money in our daughter's internet company. She assured me that as soon as the start-up actually started up, and the conversion from virtual to actual proved sufficiently viable, then she would be able to pay it all back. \nEVELYN I'm not sure I understand what most of those words mean. \nDOUGLAS It turns out neither did she. Douglas has put the mouthpiece back on, holds the receiver to his ear. \nDOUGLAS (CONT'D) There you are. Good as new. \nEVELYN Really? \nDOUGLAS No, of course not. I've got no idea what I'm doing. Evelyn bursts out laughing. \nDOUGLAS (CONT'D) Now, would you like me to not fix that chair? Because I can do that too. \n45B EXT. STAIRWAY. MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 45B \nThe houseboys are struggling with the unequal task of pulling Muriel's wheelchair, with Muriel in it, up the narrow steps. \nSONNY (O.S.) In honour of your arrival, a special welcome British roast for you all! \n46 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD - NIGHT 46 \nA group of mismatched table and chairs, that constitute the dining area of the hotel. \nSonny is serving up a meal. His guests, wearing garlands of marigolds, listen politely. \nSONNY .Cooked lovingly by myself and my most loyalist factotum and helper, Young Wasim ... He points to YOUNG WASIM. Who is about 80, and is sitting in the corner, fast asleep. \nMADGE Roast what? \nSONNY A wonderful taste of Blighty. \nMADGE Roast what? \nSONNY Roast goat curry. \nDOUGLAS Yes please. \nJEAN So the upshot is that he's spent all our money getting us here, and we can't leave till he's made some more. Muriel has arrived at her table. \nSONNY Gentle friends, you have found your way to this place, bequeathed to me by my beloved father, that I have raised from the ruins of his broken dreams, and renamed The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel For The Elderly And Beautiful. Yes, I use the words most deliberately... Norman is not looking very well at all. Sonny doesn't notice, keeps on going. \nSONNY (CONT'D) .You have all heard the chimes at midnight, and long in tooth have youbecome. Who knowshow many daysyou have left?But we are mosthonoured that youhave chosen tospend that time with us. Norman's head suddenly tips forward, and he falls from his chair onto the floor. \nGeneral panic. Everybody crowds round, but no one knows what to do. \nSONNY (CONT'D) Let me through, please. My brother is a doctor. He kneels next to Norman, and checks his watch as he feels for a pulse. Everybody waits. And then \nSONNY (CONT'D) This man is dead. An appalled silence. \nSONNY (CONT'D) Please, we must cover his face. We should preserve his dignity at this terrible moment. Madge looks around. All there is is a napkin. She passes it Sonny, who lays it over the face of Norman. Who promptly coughs. \nDOUGLAS He just coughed. I heard him cough! \nEVELYN He moved! He's alive! \nMADGE He's fainted, that's all. Sonny shakes his watch next to his ear. It's stopped. Norman sits up. \nNORMAN What's going on? Did I nod off? Everyone crowds round Norman, helps lift him back up. Except Muriel. She just stares at them all. \n", "test2_id": 268, "test3_input": "AJIT It's strange. I think the more operations they perform, the luckier they get. He glances down at Muriel, who betrays no signof getting Ajit's joke. \n63 EXT. MARKET. BACK STREETS - DAY 63 \nEvelyn is still searching for the right address. She's turned off the main road, and is heading down a narrow side streets. The city has become denser, and the walls seem to have closed in. She pushes her way through the crowded market. \n63A EXT. PASSAGE/COURTYARD - DAY 63A \nUncertain, Evelyn turns down a narrow alley, and suddenly finds herself in an enclosed courtyard strewn with makeshift washing lines. The atmosphere is faintly threatening. As she tries to find her way out, she becomes aware that she is being watched: the walls are full of doorways, and people have come out to stare at her. She has stumbled into their home. Evelyn tries to suppress her panic, turning from one face to another. \nEVELYN I'm so sorry. I didn't realise - She backs into a kind of flatbed trolley, piled high with cooking utensils, which clatter noisily to the ground. She goes to pick them up. \nEVELYN (CONT'D) Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry... A man is staring at her: SURESH. \nSURESH Yes. \nEVELYN (CONT'D) I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get to this address. \nSURESH Yes. \nEVELYN Do you understand me? Can you help me find this place? \nSURESH Yes. \nEVELYN Is that yes you understand, or yes you can help me? \nSURESH Yes. Some of the children who have gathered laugh at this, and the tension is broken slightly. \nEVELYN Let's go with both, shall we? \n63B EXT. STREET. JAIPUR - DAY 63B \nSuresh's flatbed trike is rolling down the street, piled impossibly high with bundles of brightly-coloured textiles. On the back, enthroned in the fabric, is Evelyn. \n64 EXT. WASTELAND - DAY 64 \nGraham is playing cricket with the teenagers. He's good, too. He whacks a ball off into the distance. \nGRAHAM \n(TRIUMPHANT) \nYES! A boy runs off to fetch the ball. Graham half-runs, half- walks to the other end, then turns for a second run, breathing heavily. Then walks back to the crease, gets ready for the next delivery. It's hot and he's tired, but he hasn't felt this good for years. \nSANJAY Give me the ball. I can take him. He turns cheerily to Graham. \nSANJAY (CONT'D) Down is where you're going, Uncle. \nGRAHAM Come on. Do your worst. They're both enjoying the banter, as Sanjay heads back to the beginning of his run-up, then turns and sprints in to bowl. As Graham watches Sanjay running towards him, Sanjay seems to slow, his movements becoming sluggish, never seeming to reach the crease. He looks at the faces of the other boys, frozen, waiting. The ball seems to take forever to leave Sanjay's hand. Graham steps back, completely fails to play a stroke, and is bowled. \nSANJAY That's what I'm talking about! I felt the need, the need for - Graham still hasn't moved. \nSANJAY (CONT'D) Are you alright, Uncle? Graham finds his voice at last. \nGRAHAM Yes. Yes, I'm fine. \n65 EXT. STREET/CALL CENTRE BUILDING - DAY 65 \nSuresh brakes, stops outside a glass-clad high-rise building. \nSURESH Yes. Suresh helps Evelyn down off the back. \nEVELYN Thank you. \nSURESH Yes. \nEVELYN This is it? \nSURESH Yes. \nEVELYN Then thank you. You're very kind. \nSURESH Yes. He rides off. Evelyn looks nervously up at the building. \n66 INT. OPERATIONS ROOM. CALL CENTRE - DAY 66 \nA brightly-lit open plan office on a high floor of the building. The city sprawls magnificently below. Partitions divide off the cubicles. Within them sit rows of workers, all early 20's, all with headsets clamped to their ears. As chaotic as the streets of Jaipur are, this place is immaculate, controlled and efficient. We hear snatches of what they're saying. \nTELEMARKETERS Thank you for talking to us today We do appreciate your call while I have you on the phone, can I talk to you about our special offers . your call is important to us . now is there anything else I can help you with ... shouldn't take more than five minutes . your custom is valuable to us \n(MORE) \n", "test3_true": "TELEMARRETERS (CONT'D) I'm afraid I'll have to refer that to my supervisor just a routine security check before we start .

CALL CENTRE - DAY 67 \nJAY (late 20's) is talking to Evelyn. \nJAY You're sure I can't offer you something? We have English Breakfast Tea. Building Tea, as you call it. \nEVELYN Builder's tea. It's called builder's tea. And no, I'm fine. Thank you. \nJAY Tell me then. How can I help you? Beat. \nEVELYN I don't think you can. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come. She stands. \nJAY \nWAIT - \nEVELYN I saw your advertisement in the local paper, and it specifically mentioned the ability to talk to older people. But this is not what I imagined ... \nJAY You came for a job? \nEVELYN I've wasted your time. \nJAY Mrs Greenslade. Everyone working here is a graduate of a good university. This is a place for ambitious people. Young people. \nEVELYN I see that. Good day. \nJAY Please. One second. Evelyn stops. \nJAY (CONT'D) It is really builder's tea? \nEVELYN Yes. We dunk biscuits into it. \nJAY You dunk? \nEVELYN It means lowering a biscuit into your tea, letting it soak in there, then trying to calculate the exact moment just before it dissolves to whip it up to the mouth, and enjoy the blissful union of biscuit and tea combined. \n(BEAT) It's more relaxing than it sounds. \nJAY Perhaps you can help us after all. \n68 INT. OPERATIONS ROOM. CALL CENTRE - DAY 68 \nA few minutes later. From the open-plan office Evelyn can be seen talking to Jay. One person watching is SUNAINA (20's). She's talking on the phone. \nSUNAINA We do appreciate your custom, which is very important to us. And can I draw your attention to our special - But the person at the other end has hung up. Sunaina starts to dial another number. Then the clock hits 11, and a buzzer sounds. Sunaina gets up, heads for the door. \n69 EXT. FORECOURT. CALL CENTRE - DAY 69 \nDozens of motorcycles are parked in front of the building. People are hanging around chatting and smoking. Sonny arrives on his motorcycle, a bag of marigolds strapped to the pillion seat. Sunaina, who is with some friends, spots him, comes over. She smiles as he pulls her to him. \nSUNAINA I get two breaks in eight hours. Explain to me why I would want to waste one of them with you - \nHe kisses her. She kisses him back. \nSONNY Leave this place. Come and work for me. \nSUNAINA You can't afford me. \nSONNY I cannot afford anything. \nSUNAINA Still tempting. I miss you. Am I coming round tonight? \nSONNY Let's meet somewhere else. I will rent a hotel room. \nSUNAINA Sonny, you own a hotel. It has many rooms. \nSONNY Some of them now occupied. With actual real guests. \nSUNAINA Paying guests? \nSONNY Why must you nitpick? It is not an attractive quality. \nSUNAINA It isn't? They kiss again, start to make out a bit. Then \nJAY (O.S.) Sunaina! They turn to see Jay who has come out of the Call Centre. \nJAY (CONT'D) (calling, to Sonny) You can let go of my sister now. Break's over. \n", "test3_id": 269}

{"train": "THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL \nWritten by \nOl Parker \nBased on the book THESE FOOLISH THINGS by Deborah Moggach \n1 OVER BLACK 1 Muffled music; soothing, generic. \nAUTOMATED VOICE Thank you for your patience. Your call is important to us. We will be with you shortly. \n2 INT. MANSION FLAT, LONDON - DAY 2 \nA neat, well-appointed flat, tastefully decorated. Framed against a large window which looks out over the city, an elegant woman in her 70's: EVELYN GREENSLADE. She's on the phone, on hold. On the desk in front of her is a brand new laptop computer; the screen reads 'Getting Started ...' \nAUTOMATED VOICE \n(ON PHONE) Thank you for your patience. Your call is important to us. We will be with you shortly. Evelyn's patience is strained nonetheless. She taps her fingers on the desk. AUTOMATED VOICE (cont'd) \n(ON PHONE) Thank you for your patience. Your call is - A slightly-accented voice finally interrupts. \nFEMALE VOICE Mrs Greenslade, thank you for \nWAITING - \nEVELYN \n(OVERLAPPING) Yes, now if you could stay on the phone for a moment and talk to me, just talk to me. I'm not even clear, I don't actually understand what it is I'm trying to order. Is wireless the same as wi-fi? And what do either of them have to do with broadband? \nFEMALE VOICE Mrs Greenslade, since the account is not in your name, before we can make any changes we need to speak to the account holder. Can I please talk to the account holder? \nEVELYN What? \nFEMALE VOICE I'm asking if I can speak to the account holder. Before we can make any changes - \nEVELYN You can't talk to him, no. \n(BEAT) He's dead. He died. There's only me. \n3 INT. CORRIDOR/JUDGES CHAMBERS. INNS OF COURT - NIGHT 3 \nGILES, a judge in full wig and robes, moves quickly down a corridor. He passes other judges, going the opposite way. He arrives at the office of GRAHAM DASHWOOD, goes in. GRAHAM is at his desk. His robes are on a hanger, his wig is on a stand beside him. \nGILES We're late. \n4 INT. CORRIDOR. INNS OF COURT - NIGHT 4 \nMoments later. Graham and Giles walk down the corridor. \nGRAHAM Bloody retirement parties. Hard cheese, soft wine, and endless speeches. Why do people do that? No one ever said about any kind of party: it was a wonderful occasion, just a shame that the speeches were so short. \nGILES it'll be you one day. \nGRAHAM One day very soon. \nGILES You've been saying that for years. They walk into a large room, full of lawyers. \n4A INT. HALL. INNS OF COURT - CONTINUOUS 4A \nAt one end of the hall, a very old JUDGE is giving a very dull speech. \nJUDGE An occasion such as this leads one to cast ones mind back to the days when I first entered my pupillage. I had the very good fortune of serving as a junior to Mr Justice Stancombe Graham's not listening any more. He's looking around the room. At the old, tired faces. \nJUDGE (CONT'D) . the unwelcome news that I would transfer Chambers, bringing to mind the old adage a fronte praecipitium, a tergo 1upi Everything seems to slow down, the judge's mouth moving more and more sluggishly, though his voice remains the same. The effect is strange .. then the sound of laughter. \nGRAHAM This is the day. Everyone looks round at him. He's almost as surprised as they are that he's spoken out loud. \nGILES Graham? \nGRAHAM This is the day. He turns and walks out. \n5 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 5 \nStaff bustle around a busy A & E ward. MURIEL lies on a bed in the corridor. The Head Nurse, KAREN, rushes past. \nMURIEL Listen, young lady. I want a cup of tea, and I want it now. \nKAREN The trolley will be along shortly. \nMURIEL How hard d'you have to fall down before you get some proper attention? Hours I've been lying here, and not a single doctor has come to see me. \nNORMAN Judith. And trust me, I've still got it. The bell goes; the signal for the women to get up and move along to the next table. Judith leaves without looking back. \nNORMAN (CONT'D) I just can't find anyone that wants it. Another hopeful candidate arrives opposite Norman. And looks crestfallen at what's on offer. \n8 INT/EXT. BEDROOM/STAIRS/HALL. FAMILY HOUSE - DAY 8 \nMADGE is in her bedroom. She's arguing with her son-in-law CRAIG. Madge's suitcases are by the door. \nCRAIG This is crazy. You're crazy. You can't just up and leave like this. \nMADGE And yet if you watch me, that's exactly what you'll see happen. She picks up her suitcases, heads out of the room. Madge's daughter JESSICA is on the landing. \nJESSICA What's going on? \nCRAIG Your mother's lost it. \nJESSICA My mother never had it. \nCRAIG Talk to her. She doesn't listen to me. \nMADGE Nobody listens to you. She heads down the stairs. Craig and Jessica follow. \nMADGE (CONT'D) \n(TO JESSICA) It's one of the great mysteries of life that someone so vibrant and fascinating as my daughter should choose to spend her life with this fraction of a man. \nJESSICA I still don't understand what's going on. \nCRAIG I just asked her to babysit. And now she says she's leaving. They're at the bottom of the stairs. Jessica's children, LIAM and KATIE, are watching. \nJESSICA But you love babysitting. \nMADGE I loved it last night. \nLIAM We had pizza and stayed up late. \nMADGE And the night before. \nKATIE We had Chinese and stayed up late. \nLIAM If you don't go, tonight we could do a curry. \nMADGE It's tempting, my darlings, but you know why I must leave. \nLIAM We know. \nKATIE (to her parents) Being here is stopping her finding a husband. \nCRAIG Another one? \nLIAM AND KATIE Bye Granny. \nMADGE Don't let the buggers get you down. Madge turns to go. \nCRAIG How many husbands have you had, anyway? She turns back, smiles. \nMADGE Including my own? Then she's out of the front door, and heading for the taxi. \nJESSICA Mother? Mother! \n9 INT/EXT. TAXI - DAY 9 \nMoments later. Madge climbs into the back of the cab. \nTAXI DRIVER Name the place, darling. Where are you going? Madge smiles. \nMADGE I have absolutely no idea. \n10 INT. MANSION FLAT - DAY 10 \nEvelyn, whom we saw earlier on the phone, is in the living room. Her son CHRISTOPHER is there. And her lawyer \nHAROLD. \nCHRISTOPHER There's no other way There just isn't. Harold told us this three months ago. \nHAROLD And I'm afraid matters have only got worse. \n8A. \nCHRISTOPHER We can't wait any longer. We need to put this flat on the market, and at least make a start at paying off Dad's debts. \nEvelyn arrives at her room, goes on in. The room is light and airy. And rather nice. But all the furniture is covered in sheets. As Evelyn stands there, Sonny comes rushing in, yanks all the sheets off, and runs out again. \n38 EXT/INT. BEDROOMS/TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 38 \nMuriel wheels herself towards her room. Standing inside is a male nurse, AJIT. Muriel swivels her chair around. Graham is just going into his room. \nMURIEL There's an Indian in there! Graham smiles, goes on into his room. Which is dusty, but comfortable and pleasant. He looks around with satisfaction. \n39 EXT. STAIRWAY, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 39 \nNorman is laboriously climbing the stairs to his room. He stops, catches his breath. \n40 EXT. TERRACE, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 40 \nAjit is attempting to explain himself to Muriel. \nMURIEL My what? \nAJIT Your physiotherapist. To help with your recovery after the operation. \nMURIEL You're not touching me. \nAJIT Traditionally that is how physiotherapy is practised. \n41 EXT. ROOF, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 41 \nNorman comes out onto the roof of the hotel. His room is right in front of him, a kind of penthouse cabin. A bed, but not much else. The trees poke in through the open window. He walks through the room, hangs his battery radio on a hook and leans out of the balcony, surveying the view. \nNORMAN This'll do. \n42 INT. RECEPTION - DAY 42 \nJean is confronting Sonny. \nJEAN I want to stay at the other hotel, the one in the brochure. \nSONNY Mrs Ainslie, prepare to be amazed. This is that very building! \nJEAN You've Photoshopped it! \nSONNY I have offered a vision of the future. \n(MORE) \nSONNY (CONT'D) Of course I had hoped that by now it would be the present. But in India we have a saying: everything will be alright in the end. So if it is not alright, then it is not yet the end. \nJEAN What will start to make this alright is for you to give us a refund. \nSONNY Of course if that is what you desire, you must have it. Absolutely no problem, I will refund you completely. \nJEAN You will? Straight away? \nSONNY Without question, Mrs Ainslie, I most definitely will. Straight away in three months. \n43 INT. GRAHAM'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 43 \nGraham is taking some things out of his bag: an old map of Jaipur, sepia-tinted photographs of a British family during the Raj, official documents yellowing with age. He picks up a photograph, looks at it. From outside, we can hear Ajit, the physiotherapist \nAJIT (O.S.) a stay of five days and it is done under general anaesthesia. A hip replacement usually takes only two hours \n44 EXT. TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 44 \nAjit's explanation continues. Muriel is trying not to panic. \nAJIT Your surgeon will remove the top end of the thigh bone, and insert an artificial bone instead. A most routine procedure. \nMURIEL Have you got a marker pen on you? \nAJIT Why? \nMURIEL I want to mark it. So you don't take the wrong hip. \n45 EXT. UPPER VERANDAH. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 45 \nDouglas is on his way down the stairs. Evelyn comes out of her bedroom. \nEVELYN Oh, hello. \nDOUGLAS Is everything alright? \nEVELYN I was just going to find the manager. \nMURIEL Hell. I'm in hell. \n47 EXT. STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 47 \nThe sun rises. A washer-man bicycles up to the hotel, a load of clean sheets balanced on his handlebars. Shopkeepers on the street are beginning to set out their wares. \nEVELYN (V.0.) Day Nine. Old habits die easier than we think, and new ones form. \n48 INT. EVELYN'S ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 48 \nEvelyn is typing - hunt and peck - at her computer. Beside her, the classified pages of the local newspaper. \nEVELYN (V.0.) No longer do I reach out in the morning for Radio 4. My news comes instead from the Jaipur \nHERALD \n49 EXT. STREET, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 49 \nA sign reads: 'THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL FOR THE \nELDERLY AND BEAUTIFUL - OPEN FOR BUSINESS.' Sonny affixes a sticker: 'NOW WITH GUESTS!' \nEVELYN (V.0.) . Soon I might even grow accustomed to the storm of car horns and vendors. \n50 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 50 \nThe main road in Jaipur is chaotically busy. Crowds, bikes, cows, dust, noise, and laughter. Sonny's battered old car has broken down. Madge is in the front seat, Douglas and Jean in the back. Sonny is aiming a couple of kicks at the engine. \nEVELYN (V.0.) Can there be anywhere else in the world that is such an assault on the senses? \n51 EXT/INT. PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE, JAIPUR - DAY 51 \nAn office out of a Kafka novel; cloth bags containing files are piled all around the room, floor to ceiling. Graham is seated at a desk, in front of a sober official. He is filling in a form. \nEVELYN (V.0.) Those who know the country of old just go about their business. But nothing can prepare the uninitiated for this riot of noise and colour ... \n51A EXT. JANTAR MANTAR OBSERVATORY. JAIPUR - DAY 51A \nNorman seems less interested in the astonishing geometric devices of the ancient observatory than in the female tourists who have come to see them... \n52 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 52 \nThe chaos and din of the street is even more mind-boggling. Madge now has the bonnet up, and is studying the engine. Douglas stands in the street, staring in wonderment around him. Inside the car, Jean looks utterly traumatized, shrinking lower in her seat as a horde of kids swarm at the windows, shouting, wheedling, gesticulating. Sonny does his best to wave them away. \nEVELYN (V.0.) ... for the heat, the motion, the perpetual teeming crowds. Sonny is conducting his own personal assault on our senses \n53 INT. UPPER COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 53 \nThe guests look on with trepidation, as another meal is laid before them. \nEVELYN (V.0.) with the flow of exotic dishes he demands daily from the kitchen. Mooli Moong Dal. Baghara Baingan. Banjari Gosht. Paneer Methi Chaman ... As the list unfolds, the guests, one by one, enter their bathrooms; a litany of doors closing Until Norman. EVELYN (V.0.) (cont'd) Mutton Vindaloo ... Norman lies on his bed, reading the Kama Sutra. He spins the book round, in order to study an illustration more intently. \n54 INT. HOSPITAL, JAIPUR - DAY 54 \nThe hospital puts the NHS to shame. It's hi-tech, bright, and spanking clean. \nSonny pushes Muriel through the doors of the lobby. The reception area is a forest of dark skin. Muriel is rigid with fear. \nEVELYN (V.0.) Initially you're overwhelmed. But gradually you realise: it's like a wave. Resist, and you'll be knocked over ... Sonny is in discussion with some doctors. Then he turns to see that Muriel has vanished. Through the window Muriel can be seen frantically wheeling herself away down the path... EVELYN (V.0.) (cont'd) Dive into it, and you'll swim out the other side. \n55 EXT/INT. STREET/ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 55 \nMadge is exchanging some coins with a street trader in return for a mobile phone. In her room, Madge scans a phone directory, and dials a number. \nEVELYN (V.0.) This is a new and different world. \n56 INT. EVELYN'S ROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 56 \nEvelyn is finishing her blog. She picks up the paper, checks something. \nEVELYN (V.0.) The challenge is to cope with it. \n57 EXT. GARDEN, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 57 \nEvelyn is coming down the path to the gate. \nEVELYN (V.0.) And not just cope ... but thrive. \n58 EXT. STREET, JAIPUR - DAY 58 \nEvelyn is walking down a rough street on the outskirts of the city. Kids are everywhere, laughing, shouting, doing tricks, begging. Evelyn approaches them, holding up a piece of paper. \nAJIT It's strange. I think the more operations they perform, the luckier they get. He glances down at Muriel, who betrays no signof getting Ajit's joke. \n63 EXT. MARKET. BACK STREETS - DAY 63 \nEvelyn is still searching for the right address. She's turned off the main road, and is heading down a narrow side streets. The city has become denser, and the walls seem to have closed in. She pushes her way through the crowded market. \n63A EXT. PASSAGE/COURTYARD - DAY 63A \nUncertain, Evelyn turns down a narrow alley, and suddenly finds herself in an enclosed courtyard strewn with makeshift washing lines. The atmosphere is faintly threatening. As she tries to find her way out, she becomes aware that she is being watched: the walls are full of doorways, and people have come out to stare at her. She has stumbled into their home. Evelyn tries to suppress her panic, turning from one face to another. \nEVELYN I'm so sorry. I didn't realise - She backs into a kind of flatbed trolley, piled high with cooking utensils, which clatter noisily to the ground. She goes to pick them up. \nEVELYN (CONT'D) Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry... A man is staring at her: SURESH. \nSURESH Yes. \nEVELYN (CONT'D) I'm sorry, I'm just trying to get to this address. \nSURESH Yes. \nEVELYN Do you understand me? Can you help me find this place? \nSURESH Yes. \nEVELYN Is that yes you understand, or yes you can help me? \nSURESH Yes. Some of the children who have gathered laugh at this, and the tension is broken slightly. \nEVELYN Let's go with both, shall we? \n63B EXT. STREET. JAIPUR - DAY 63B \nSuresh's flatbed trike is rolling down the street, piled impossibly high with bundles of brightly-coloured textiles. On the back, enthroned in the fabric, is Evelyn. \n64 EXT. WASTELAND - DAY 64 \nGraham is playing cricket with the teenagers. He's good, too. He whacks a ball off into the distance. \nGRAHAM \n(TRIUMPHANT) \nYES! A boy runs off to fetch the ball. Graham half-runs, half- walks to the other end, then turns for a second run, breathing heavily. Then walks back to the crease, gets ready for the next delivery. It's hot and he's tired, but he hasn't felt this good for years. \nSANJAY Give me the ball. I can take him. He turns cheerily to Graham. \nSANJAY (CONT'D) Down is where you're going, Uncle. \nGRAHAM Come on. Do your worst. They're both enjoying the banter, as Sanjay heads back to the beginning of his run-up, then turns and sprints in to bowl. As Graham watches Sanjay running towards him, Sanjay seems to slow, his movements becoming sluggish, never seeming to reach the crease. He looks at the faces of the other boys, frozen, waiting. The ball seems to take forever to leave Sanjay's hand. Graham steps back, completely fails to play a stroke, and is bowled. \nSANJAY That's what I'm talking about! I felt the need, the need for - Graham still hasn't moved. \nSANJAY (CONT'D) Are you alright, Uncle? Graham finds his voice at last. \nGRAHAM Yes. Yes, I'm fine. \n65 EXT. STREET/CALL CENTRE BUILDING - DAY 65 \nSuresh brakes, stops outside a glass-clad high-rise building. \nSURESH Yes. Suresh helps Evelyn down off the back. \nEVELYN Thank you. \nSURESH Yes. \nEVELYN This is it? \nSURESH Yes. \nEVELYN Then thank you. You're very kind. \nSURESH Yes. He rides off. Evelyn looks nervously up at the building. \n66 INT. OPERATIONS ROOM. CALL CENTRE - DAY 66 \nA brightly-lit open plan office on a high floor of the building. The city sprawls magnificently below. Partitions divide off the cubicles. Within them sit rows of workers, all early 20's, all with headsets clamped to their ears. As chaotic as the streets of Jaipur are, this place is immaculate, controlled and efficient. We hear snatches of what they're saying. \nTELEMARKETERS Thank you for talking to us today We do appreciate your call while I have you on the phone, can I talk to you about our special offers . your call is important to us . now is there anything else I can help you with ... shouldn't take more than five minutes . your custom is valuable to us \n(MORE) \nSONNY Hello Jay. \nJAY Sonny boy. \nSONNY Don't call me that. Jay smiles, holds the door open for Sunaina. \nJAY Let's go. \n70 EXT. GARDEN - EVENING 70 \nJean is sitting in a chair, reading. Graham comes up the path. \nJEAN Good evening, Your Honour. \nGRAHAM Mrs Ainslie. I hope you had a good day. What did you get up to? \nJEAN Well, I started in my bedroom, where I had a lovely couple of hours giving all the cockroaches names. Then after a lunch that will long have a place in my heartburn, I came out here and stared blindly at a book waiting for someone - anyone to rescue me. And how glad I am it was you. \nGRAHAM Why would you not go out? There's so much to see. Jean had hoped for some appreciation of her wit, and is floored by his question. She can hardly understand, let alone tell him, the depths of her discomfort. \nGRAHAM (CONT'D) Open your eyes, Mrs Ainslie. All life is here, I tell you. Jean stares at him. He goes on through the archway into the hotel. Then stops. \nGRAHAM (CONT'D) I could talk to the chef, if you like. Perhaps get you some grilled chicken, plain rice. \nJEAN I would appreciate that very much. Graham goes on in. Jean just sits there. Wishing he'd come back out again. \n71 EXT. TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 71 \nMuriel is back. She's in her chair, on the terrace outside her room. A young hotel worker, ANOKHI, brings out a tray of food to her. Muriel watches her, but Anokhi is deferential, won't meet Muriel's eyes. She puts the tray down and leaves. Muriel just sits there, glaring balefully into the night, the untouched tray of food by her side. \n72 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD - NIGHT 72 \nEvelyn comes into the dining area. Graham is there, at a table in the corner. \nGRAHAM Good evening. \nEVELYN Good evening. Evelyn sits at her table. \nEVELYN (CONT'D) I trust you had a good day? \nGRAHAM I'd rather hear about yours. \nEVELYN I got a job. My first. Ever. I'm going to be a sort of cultural advisor. \nGRAHAM A role I'm sure you'll perform with great distinction. He's about to inquire further, when Evelyn sees Douglas and Jean emerge from their room. \nEVELYN Perhaps if you wouldn't mind keeping that news to yourself. \nGRAHAM I'm flattered you shared it with me. He turns to greet the new arrivals. \nGRAHAM (CONT'D) Good evening, the Ainslies. \nEVELYN Have you had a good day? \nDOUGLAS Spectacular. \n(TO GRAHAM) I went to the temple you told me about. A place of meditation and peace, quite stunning. \nJEAN So spiritual, I bet you hardly noticed the smell of elephant dung. \nDOUGLAS No elephants, sadly. Still none. \n(TO GRAHAM) I thought I might see you there. Where did you get to instead? \nJEAN Yes, where do you get to every day? \nGRAHAM Well, I've just finished telling Mrs Greenslade all about it. Evelyn registers the lie, but says nothing. \nJEAN I'm sure she wouldn't mind hearing it again. She waits. But Graham is as elusive as he is tactful. \nGRAHAM I talked to the chef for you. He said it will be no problem. \nJEAN Did you hear that, Douglas? Plain grilled food; manna from heaven. \nDOUGLAS I don't have to have it too, do \nI? \nJEAN \n(TO GRAHAM) I don't know how to thank you. \nEVELYN Which is beautiful. You people are young, vibrant, real. I'm sure the typical housewife would enjoy talking to each and every one of you. \nSUNAINA Her morning sounds like fun. What are you doing here? Beat. \nEVELYN I suppose I'm not typical anymore. \n(TO JAY) Is that the sort of thing? \n84 INT. MADGE'S ROOM - EVENING 84 \nMadge is at her mirror, doing her make-up with great care. She looks beautiful. \n85 EXT. VICEROY CLUB BAR - EVENING 85 \nMadge walks up the gravel path towards the magnificent building. She's superbly dressed, looks great. She goes up to the BARMAN. \nMADGE Excuse me. Would there be any wealthy single men in tonight? \nBARMAN There is one. Madge puts some money into his breast pocket. \nMADGE Perhaps you could seat me next to him? \nBARMAN This way, madam. He leads her along across the terrace. Madge follows, checking her hair, her breath, etc. The barman reaches an ornate suite of furniture. There's someone sitting there, his back to us, an elegant arm draped over the side of the chair. \nBARMAN (CONT'D) His Royal Highness Prince Michael of Kent. The man rises from his chair and turns. And Madge is left staring at Norman. There's a pause. Then Madge reaches into the barman's breast pocket, and removes her money. \nMADGE I'll have that back, thank you very much. \n86 EXT. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 86 \nGraham comes through the courtyard, heads for his room. Muriel is on her verandah. \nGRAHAM Good evening. Muriel nods at him, and he goes on into his room. A moment later, Jean sits down next to Muriel. \nJEAN You know where he goes. I know you know. But you won't tell me. Muriel says nothing. \nJEAN (CONT'D) I can get Hobnobs out here, you know. I know a way. \n(BEAT) As many as you want. Milk or plain. Long pause. \nMURIEL Public Records Office. \nJEAN Thank you. \n87 EXT. WELL - EVENING 87 \nA huge construction, centuries old, with a series of steps reaching down deep into the earth, so people can climb down to get their water. Young couples sit on the steps in the evening heat, boys leap into the water. Sonny and Sunaina are watching the swimmers. \nSONNY My father used to bring me to this well to swim. He said the water was better, and so were the people we would meet. \n(BEAT) He would have liked you so much. Sunaina smiles at this. \nSONNY (CONT'D) My mother doesn't want us to be married. \nSUNAINA She hasn't met me yet. \nSONNY She doesn't need to meet you Sunaina absorbs this. \nSONNY (CONT'D) She knows you are not from Delhi. That you have no family money, and work in a call centre. You are a part of a new India she cannot welcome. \nSUNAINA Isn't this where you tell her what you want? \nSONNY That conversation will be easier when the hotel is a success. \nSUNANINA Do you love me? \nSONNY I have found a new investor. I am most optimistic that he will enable us to move forward with Phase Two of the Marigold Hotel \nPROJECT \nSUNANINA Shouldn't you finish Phase One first? \nSONNY In business, if you stand still, you move backwards. No, I have that wrong. If you stand still, you are overtaken by people going the other way. Wait - \nSUNAINA You didn't answer the question. Do you love me? \nSONNY My feelings for you cannot be reduced to a single word. \nSUNAINA It's a nice word, Sonny. And people like hearing it. \nSONNY Sunaina, please. My mother is wrong. It is you who are too good for me. \nCAROL I'm afraid I don't. Madge gets up. \nMADGE I have to splash some water on my face. Please God I drown in it. She heads for the bathroom. Norman and Carol share another silence. \nCAROL Well look, it's been lovely chatting. \nNORMAN No it hasn't. \nCAROL No. It hasn't. But I really \nMUST - \nNORMAN Carol? She was about to go, stops. \nNORMAN (CONT'D) Can we drop all this pretence? And start again? I'm not charming. I'm not good at repartee. And I'm not a plutocrat with the sexual capacity of a rutting rhino. My name is Norman. And I'm lonely. \nCAROL My name is Carol. So am I. \n89 INT. VICEROY CLUB BAR - NIGHT 89 \nMinutes later. Madge comes out of the bathroom. \nEVELYN (V.0.) Day 22. Like Darwin's finches, we are slowly adapting to our environment. And when one does adapt, my god, the riches that are available. Madge looks across the bar. And is startled to see Norman and Carol chatting up a storm, laughing together. As she watches, Norman orders more drinks, then turns smiling back to his new friend. Madge walks slowly out of the bar, and into the night. \n90 INT. EVELYN'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 90 \nEvelyn is at her computer, typing. \nEVELYN (V.0.) There is no past that we can bring back by longing for it \n91 EXT. PATH/GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 91 \nAjit is pushing Muriel down to the gate for her morning constitutional. \nEVELYN . only a present that builds and creates itself as the past withdraws ... \n92 INT. SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE. CALL CENTRE - DAY 92 \nJay is counting out cash into Evelyn's hand; her first paycheck. \nEVELYN And India, like so many things in life, like life itself I suppose, is about what you bring to it. \n93 EXT. JAIPUR STREET - DAY 93 \nAjit is pushing Muriel through a poor neighborhood. Muriel is looking left and right, astounded by the life she sees. \nMURIEL Where's this? Where are we? \nAJIT Janta Colony Kachi Basti. \nMURIEL What happened to my usual route? \nAJIT Anokhi has invited you to her home. \nMURIEL You didn't tell me. \nAJIT You'd have said no. \n94 INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 94 \nJean is sitting, reading a book. \nJEAN Will you check in at the bank? Douglas emerges from the bathroom. \nDOUGLAS I checked yesterday. And the day before. As requested. \n(BEAT) Will you be staying in again? \nJEAN Why do you ask that every morning? \nDOUGLAS Because I hope for a different answer. Because I think you'll be hurt if I don't. And because it's not healthy for you to spend all day and every day in the confines of the hotel. He goes back into the bathroom. Jean changes the subject. \nJEAN I didn't sleep a wink. The tap in there never stops dripping. \nDOUGLAS (O.S.) I talked to Young Wasim about it. \nJEAN What did he say? \nDOUGLAS (O.S.) No idea. It was in Hindi. Douglas comes out of the bathroom, holding the tap. \nDOUGLAS (CONT'D) I thought I might get it fixed myself. \nEVELYN Yes. The thing is, you see, I did actually want to buy that. To brighten up my room. \nDOUGLAS He'll come after us. \nEVELYN Do you think so? \nDOUGLAS Absolutely. This is how the game is played. Just keep on walking. They push through the crowds. \nDOUGLAS (CONT'D) He's playing it cool, but he'll come. They keep walking. \nDOUGLAS (CONT'D) He's playing it very cool. They keep walking. Then Douglas stops. Evelyn looks at him. \nDOUGLAS (CONT'D) He's not coming. \nCUT TO: Moments later. They're back at Akram's stall. Evelyn counts out the money. \nEVELYN Eight hundred and fifty, nine hundred, nine hundred and fifty, one thousand. She turns to Douglas, smiles. \nEVELYN (CONT'D) You'll get him next time. Then she notices something. \nEVELYN (CONT'D) Why are you carrying a tap? \n97 INT. MARIGOLD HOTEL, DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM - DAY 97 \nJean gives up on the sentence she has already read a hundred times, and snaps her book shut. She stands, then sits again. Then stands. \n98 EXT. SWEEPER COLONY - DAY 98 \nAjit is now pushing Muriel through a poverty-stricken slum. The people live on the streets, or in collapsing tin shacks. Everywhere there is struggle and deprivation. And yet the pervasive atmosphere is nowhere near as depressing as we would expect. The colours are bright, the smiles on the children's faces even brighter. Not that Muriel can recognise the joy, of course. She's horrified by her surroundings. And acutely aware of the stares of the slum-dwellers. \n98A EXT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 98A \nA primitive brick and cement hut, one of the few amongst dwellings made mostly from sticks and plastic bags. A bunch of young kids are fascinated by Muriel's wheelchair, pushing it around and taking turns to sit on it. \n99 INT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 99 \nMuriel sits on the only chair. Opposite - squashed together as if posing for a photograph - are all the generations of Anokhi's family: Anokhi herself, her husband, mother, grandmother, and several children. They all smile at Muriel. A long pause. Then Muriel turns to Ajit. \nMURIEL How soon can I leave? \n100 INT/EXT. HARDWARE SHOP - DAY 100 \nDouglas is talking to JAMSHED, who works behind the counter. Evelyn sits outside. \nDOUGLAS You see what I think, and of course I'm no expert, is that the valve seat has eroded, so we'll need the washer changed and a new seat re-ground. Douglas glances back at Evelyn. Who betrays not the slightest scepticism. Jamshed studies the tap. \nJAMSHED The gland nut has come away from the spindle. \nDOUGLAS Well of course, it could be that too. Can you fix it? \nJAMSHED Not cheaply. Not cheaply. Most expensively indeed. Jamshed takes the tap to a workstation at the back, starts to fiddle with it. Douglas joins Evelyn. \nDOUGLAS I was in a tuk-tuk the other day, didn't seem to be taking the usual route back to the hotel. It turned out that the driver had decided to take me to another hotel, that he was sure I would prefer. And of course one wants to believe that he genuinely had my welfare at heart, and that it wasn't run bg his brother-in-law. \n(MORE) \nDOUGLAS (CONT'D) One wants to trust, in general, don't you think? But you never really know, do you? Jamshed stops fiddling with the tap. And takes a hammer to it. \nEVELYN The day I met my husband was the day the fair came to town. My girlfriend and I went on the carousel. Her horse was fine. But when the ride began I felt mine give a little, like it might collapse. Then these strong arms were around me, holding the horse together. And a voice in my ear said \"Just trust me\". And I did. Without question. Until the day he died. \nDOUGLAS How wonderful. \nEVELYN The sale of our flat went through last week. I had to sell it to pay off Hugh's debts. \n(BEAT) I've been forced to get a job out here. Which, in fact, I love. But even at Sonny's rates, I still couldn't make ends meet. After what my own husband did to our life savings. \n(BEAT) So no. You're right. You never know. Jamshed holds up the tap. Which is now in several parts. \nJAMSHED No good. You must be buying another. \n101 EXT. PATHWAY/GATE/STREET, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 101 \nJean walks down the path to the gate. She stops, looks fearfully at the chaotic sea of humanity outside. She's unable to move. Finally, she steps out. And is of course immediately assaulted by the assorted kids, beggars, street vendors, etc. As anxiety begins to engulf her, she quickens her pace, brushing through them as best she can, until she is almost running. \n102 INT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 102 \nMuriel is still at the tea party. Anokhi speaks. Ajit translates. \nAJIT She wants to thank you for your kindness. \nMURIEL I haven't been kind. \nGRAHAM I'm not embarrassed. Jean smiles wanly, grateful for his lie. \nJEAN Like I said. This country is driving me mad. \n(BEAT) Shall we go? \n107 EXT/INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY107 \nEvelyn is outside in the courtyard. We don't see Douglas. \nEVELYN Anything? \nDOUGLAS (O.S.) Not yet. Evelyn waits a moment. \nEVELYN How about now? \nDOUGLAS (O.S.) One second. Another pause. DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd) Oh good lord. \nEVELYN What? \nDOUGLAS (O.S.) Listen. The sound of a flowing tap. DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd) And now ... The tap stops. DOUGLAS (O.S.) (cont'd) No drip. He appears in the doorway, triumphant. \nDOUGLAS (CONT'D) No drip! He walks towards her, hand in the air. \nDOUGLAS (CONT'D) Hi-five ! Evelyn just looks at him. She's never hi-fived anyone in her life. After a moment Douglas puts his hand down. \nDOUGLAS (CONT'D) I've never done that before. It just seemed appropriate. Jean has appeared at the other side of the courtyard. Douglas senses her mood, moves towards her. \nDOUGLAS (CONT'D) Darling! \nEVELYN Mrs Ainslie, how are you? Did you have a good day? Jean doesn't answer. She's staring at Douglas. Who looks so happy. \nDOUGLAS Let me tell you about ours. Your husband of many a year, who has never even known which end of a hammer to use, has actually managed to - \nJEAN \n(SUDDENLY INTERRUPTING) We have to get out of here. \nDOUGLAS What did you say? \nJEAN I can't stay in this country a moment longer. \nDOUGLAS Why ...? \nEVELYN Do excuse me. She makes a tactful exit. Jean is going past Douglas into their room. \nDOUGLAS I don't understand \nJEAN \n(INTERRUPTING) Pick a reason. Pick ten. The climate, the squalor, the poverty She goes past him into their room. \n108 INT. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 108 \nJEAN . we should never have come. This whole trip is a grotesque fantasy. It's time to go home. Jean starts to pack. Irrationally, compulsively. \nDOUGLAS Who's paying for the tickets? \nJEAN (not hearing him) Look at us. A group of self- deluding old fossils traipsing around as if it's our bloody gap year. Humiliating ourselves \nDOUGLAS Not us, we can't pay. And I don't see you asking our friends \nBACK HOME \nJEAN \n(OVERLAPPING) .. We should just face up to the truth. That we're all old, we're all past it. That's the real truth, the raw, unvarnished fact of the matter. All we're good for now is the beige bloody bungalow with the sodding panic button in the sodding corner ... She stops packing, and subsides onto the bed, crying quietly. Nobody speaks for a while. \nDOUGLAS \n(GENTLY) We just have to make the best of it, darling. I really think that's the best thing to do. \nJEAN Yes, well. When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you. \n109 INT. MEEHAR CLINIC - MORNING 109 \nAn impossibly small roadside clinic. Norman is sitting there, the only man in three rows of brightly dressed women. DR RAMA comes out of the consulting area. \nDR RAMA Mr John Smith. No response. The doctor looks at Norman, who has forgotten his own alias. DR RAMA (cont'd) Mr John Smith? Norman jumps up. \nNORMAN That's right! Me! \nDR RAMA I've got some pills that'll help. \n112 EXT. SERVANTS COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 112 \nThe back of the hotel, where Sonny envisages his Phase Two development. Very dilapidated. Anokhi is cleaning pots. Young Wasim sits in the corner. Ajit has just wheeled Muriel into the courtyard. \nMURIEL \n(TO ANOKHI) I wanted to tell you something... Anokhi looks up. \nMURIEL (CONT'D) \n(TO AJIT) Tell her. Tell her I was glad to come, glad she invited me. Ajit translates. \nMURIEL (CONT'D) Glad to meet her family. Her grandmother. Her kids. Ajit translates. Anokhi speaks. \nAJIT She asks if you have children? \nMURIEL I looked after somebody else's. Ajit translates. \nMURIEL (CONT'D) This one family, years I was with them. I ran the house, looked after the money, did it all, cared for them like they were my own. Ajit starts to translate. But Muriel doesn't wait. \nMURIEL (CONT'D) That's the mistake, see. You don't want to get like that, to start feeling part of something. One day they decided I needed some help. I was grateful, I tried to teach her. Not just the books, but how to crisp up the bacon like the gentleman preferred it, the way the little one liked to have her hair brushed. The things you only know if you care. But then they said I was no longer useful to them. Thanked me for my service. As if that's all it was. \n(BEAT) I got a flat in the end. I'm the only one in the building not a foreigner. More Indians there than here! But before I came to this place, my biggest problem was what to do with all the time I had. Because that flat's so small, I can have the whole place spotless in half an hour. And then what am I supposed to do for the rest of the day? There's silence for a bit. Then Ajit speaks. \nAJIT Did you want me translate that as well? Muriel smiles. It's the first time we've seen this. Muriel stops, thrusts something into Ajit's hand. \nMURIEL Give her these. \nAjit hands Anokhi what Muriel gave him: a packet of Chocolate Hobnobs. This time it's Muriel who cannot meet Anokhi's eye. Tries to hide her desire to leave. Ajit turns her chair and pushes her away. Over this, the sound of singing \n113 EXT. ROOFTOP. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 113 \nNorman's on his rooftop, under the primitive spout of water that passes as his shower. Hanging from a nail in the wall, the battery radio is pumping out a bizarre Indian cover version of the Chic song \"Le Freak\". Norman is naked, and singing along lustily. \nNORMAN Aaaaaah, freak out! Le freak, c'est chic .. Aaaah, freak out! Feet slapping in the soapy water, he performs a nifty disco move. \n114 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 114 \nSonny is in his office, going through the accounts. There's a strange ringing somewhere nearby. He pays no attention, then stops and thinks for a moment. Then realises what it is. He sweeps the pile of papers off the desk, starts frantically looking for the telephone. \n115 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 115 \nGraham and Evelyn are having drinks. \nEVELYN I've been getting out and about as much as I can, but I feel I've hardly scratched the surface. And of course I'd love to see Udaipur. The lake you talked about. \nGRAHAM I'd love to take you. Perhaps - He breaks off. Douglas and Jean have come in. Jean looks rather desperate. \nEVELYN AND DOUGLAS \n(SIMULTANEOUSLY) Good evening. \n81A. An awkward moment. Graham stands. \nGRAHAM Good evening, Mrs Ainslie. Please allow me. He pulls a chair out for her. She shoots him a look of passionate gratitude for his exquisite sensitivity. \nJEAN You're very kind. But I rather think I'll turn in early. Goodnight everyone. She goes into her room. \n116 EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 116 \nMuriel is sitting outside her room, doing the crossword. Madge is coming through the arch, stops dead. Norman is standing in front of her, on his way out. He looks transformed. And rather handsome. \nMADGE Is this it? \nNORMAN This is it. \nMADGE You're not worried about the danger of having sex at your age? Norman shrugs. \nNORMAN If she dies, she dies. He leaves. Sonny sprints into the courtyard. \nSONNY Progress, Mrs Donnelly, Mrs Hardcastle! The wheel is turning most assuredly in our favour! He shoots up the stairs. \n117 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING. 117 \nDouglas, Graham and Evelyn are looking at the menu. Sonny bursts in. \nSONNY Mr Dashwood! Everybody! Great news! \nGRAHAM What is it, Sonny? \nSonny is sleeping peacefully. \n123 EXT. COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 123 \nSunaina moves across the courtyard. Not sneaking, exactly. But making no sound. \n124 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 124 \nSonny sleeps on. \n125 INT. CORRIDOR, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 125 \nSunaina is definitely sneaking now. She aims down the passage towards Sonny's room. \n126 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 126 \nSonny stirs, but doesn't wake up. \n127 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 127 \nSunaina comith esno te bedroom. She takes off her clothes. And climbs, naked, into bed beside the sleeping figure. \n128 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 128 \nA loud scream. In a different bed, in a different room, Sonny wakes up. And remembers. \n129 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 129 \nIt's Sunaina that's screamed. Because she's in bed with Madge. Who couldn't be happier. \nMADGE A midnight booty call. How utterly marvellous. \n130 INT. CORRIDOR, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 130 \nSonny hares out of his temporary bedroom, and races down the corridor, towards Madge's room. \n131 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 131 \nSunaina has jumped out of the bed and across the room, grabbing one of Madge's generous scarves to cover her nakedness. \nSUNAINA I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry . I don't know what your name is, but I'm incredibly sorry. \nMADGE Don't be. Most action I've had in weeks. \nSUNAINA If you could just please not \nMENTION - Sonny bursts in. \nSONNY Do not worry, Mrs Hardcastle! I can explain each and every thing! Hesees Sunaina. \nSONNY (CONT'D) Oh my god you are naked. He turns to Madge. \nSONNY (CONT'D) Mrs Hardcastle, I must apologise with deep and profound sincerity - \nSUNAINA How could you not tell me you weren't in your room! \nSONNY Yes, Sunaina, to you too I must apologise with equally deep and profound sincerity. Now go. Get out. Quickly. \nSUNAINA I'm going. Just let me get dressed, and - \nSONNY No no, quicker than that. You must leave, before - MrsKapoor flings open the door. \nMRS KAPOOR What is going on here? Who screamed? She sees the nearly-naked Sunaina. MRS KAPOOR (cont'd) No no no no no. No! This is a respectable hotel, not a brothel. \n(TO SUNAINA) You, get out. \n(TO MADGE) And Mrs Hardcastle, I expected better of you. Actually, this is exactly what I expected of you, but nevertheless - \nSUNAINA Mrs Kapoor, I'm Sunaina. \nMRS KAPOOR Since I will not be paying for your services, your name is of no interest to me. \n(BEAT) How do you know mine? Sunaina is shocked to realise that Mrs Kapoor doesn't know her name. Sonny steps forward reluctantly. \nSONNY Because this . is my Sunaina. \nMRS KAPOOR The girl who my son described as not too modern. \nMADGE This is getting interesting. \nMRS KAPOOR \n139 EXT. GARDEN, MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 139 \nGraham is still sitting in the garden. \nEVELYN (O.S.) You're back. He doesn't turn round. Evelyn has come out to the garden. She goes over to him. \nEVELYN (CONT'D) It's been rather an extraordinary night all round. First tell me your news, and then - She breaks off. Graham is dead. \n139A EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 139A \nEVELYN (V.0.) Day 45. Of course it was inevitable. Put enough old people in the same place, it won't be too long before one of them goes... Jean, Douglas, Madge, Norman and Muriel shocked and sobered \n140 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 140 \nA train is crossing the endless fields. \n141 INT. TRAIN - DAY 141 \nEvelyn stares out of the window. Madge, Norman, Douglas and Jean are behind her. Opposite sits Manoj. Evelyn turns to look at him, and at Gaurika, Manoj's wife, who sits beside him. \nEVELYN (V.0.) We all know it'll happen, but few of us know when. Graham died of a heart attack, evidently not his first. So he had a better idea than most what was coming, he just neglected to tell us. His prerogative. \n142 EXT. LAKE - DAWN 142 \nThree white vehicles are driving across a narrow causeway, which barely rises above the surface of the lake. They seem to be floating. Clouds of dust billow behind them. \nEVELYN (V.0.) There was talk of sending the body home, but Manoj felt he should have a Hindu burial. At the place they had visited together. Not a holy place. Although for them perhaps it was. \n143 EXT. FUNERAL PYRE, RUINS - DAY 143 \nA ruined garden, surrounded by the waters of the lake, crumbling pillared porticoes and arches. What must once have been a royal retreat is now long abandoned and overgrown. Graham's friends stand watching the pyre, transfixed by the flames. Manoj, dressed in white, stands with Gaurika. He recites a Hindi prayer. \nEVELYN (V.0.) A body takes a long time to be consumed. Many hours for the mourners to remember their dead. The fire must be lit at dawn, and by sunset, there must be nothing left but ash. \n144 EXT. LAKESIDE - SUNSET 144 \nStripped to the waist, Manoj walks into the water, holding a bowl. \nEVELYN (V.0.) Where do our souls go? is that all of us that is left behind? Perhaps the most we can ask is that when we do shuffle off, we do so knowing that we were loved Manoj pours Graham onto the water. The ashes shim r and dance, caught in the gentle currents. \n145 EXT. SERVANT'S GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 145 \nMuriel and Anokhi are in the servants' garden. Young Wasim sits silently in the corner. \nMURIEL So there's a process, they call it pickling. I have no idea what it is, or how they do it, but whoever invented it was a smart man. But the real genius was the one who introduced an onion into the system. That I could never have thought of. \nAjit looks at her, ready to translate. \nMURIEL (CONT'D) No, forget it. Muriel is looking out at the yard. She sees Mrs Kapoor, talking to some surveyors. They're mapping out the building. Mrs Kapoor sees Muriel watching her, comes over to them. \nMRS KAPOOR Mrs Donnelly, what are you doing here? You should not be here, talking with this one. \nMURIEL I'm helping her clean. If these pots get any dirtier, you'll have to serve the food with penicillin. \nMRS KAPOOR We have other rooms. Go to one of them instead. While this is still a hotel. She turns back to the surveyors. \nMURIEL \n(TO AJIT) What's her problem? What's happening here? Ajit can't answer. But he knows a man who can. He points to Young Wasim. \nAJIT He can tell you. \n146 EXT. ROOFTOP BAR, BHARATPUR PALACE HOTEL. UDAIPUR - 146 \nEVENING A stunning view over the city. Madge is having a drink with Norman. Douglas is sitting on the wall, but keeps looking down towards the stairs. \nMADGE When someone dies, you think about your own life. And in my case, there is less of it in front of me than behind. And I don't want to grow older. I don't want to be condescended to, ignored and marginalised by society. To become peripheral to the action. \n(MORE) \nMADGE (coat' d) I don't want to be the first person let off the plane in a hostage crisis. They laugh together. And don't even see Douglas go. \n147 EXT. LANDING. BHARATPUR PALACE HOTEL - EVENING 147 \nThe landing is large, and open to the sky. Evelyn has just come up the stairs to go to her room. She's leaning against the stone baluster. \nDOUGLAS I wondered where you'd been. Evelyn turns. Douglas is on the stairs above her. \nDOUGLAS (CONT'D) We're all up top, having a drink. \nEVELYN I went to see Gaurika. Manoj's wife. I wanted to ask her what she knew. And the answer was that she knew everything, that he'd loved another man, and always would. He told her when the marriage was arranged. \nSONNY (Glancing back for a moment) Working for me, Mr Maruthi. To create a home for the elderly so wonderful that they will simply refuse to die! Stare death in the face and say- \n(MORE) \n98A. \nSONNY (CONT'D) (follows Mr Maruthi's \nGAZE) What are those men doing? \n151 EXT. KITCHEN/SERVANT'S GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 151 \nMoments later. Through the window, Muriel watches Sonny confronting his mother. \nSONNY Mummyji, what is going on here? \nMRS KAPOOR I have spoken to your brothers. They want to sell the hotel. These men are here to value the building. \nSONNY They are valuing the land. My brothers do not care about the building. They will knock it down. \nMRS KAPOOR They could just wait a month for it to fall down of its own accord. \nSONNY You joke, Mummyji, but inside I know you are not laughing. You do not want to see this dream destroyed. Send these people away. \nMRS KAPOOR No, my son. It is too late. \n152 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 152 \nMrs Kapoor is at the desk, going through the accounts. Sonny stands opposite her. \nSONNY Mummyji, please - \nMRS KAPOOR These figures do not support your argument. \nSONNY There is still time to turn things around. With a small injection of funds, we can - \nMRS KAPOOR Who is trusting you with that money? Eh? You, who cannot run a chai stand. Just like your father. \nBeat. Then Sonny speaks quietly. \nSONNY Do I remind you of him so much? Is that why you must be cruel to me? \nMRS KAPOOR You think I am cruel? \nSONNY You loved my father. And he loved this hotel. \nMRS KAPOOR \n(FIERCELY) Two mistakes. There will not be a third. \n(BEAT) Say goodbye to all this, Sonny. And come with me to Delhi. Your life will become easier. \nSONNY Not easier, Mummyji. Smaller. He leaves. Mrs Kapoor comes back to the desk, fiddling with some paperwork, discomfited. She turns to the doorway. Muriel is there, in her chair. \nMRS KAPOOR Mrs Donnelly. Can I help you? \nMURIEL Depends. Do you know how to use a computer? \nMRS KAPOOR I assume you are joking. \nMURIEL Mrs Ainslie said she had an address where I could get some things I need. Some biscuits. She said I could get them on the line. \nMRS KAPOOR I wish you luck. Mrs Kapoor smiles, and leaves. Muriel watches her go, then turns to the computer. Her fingers fly across the keyboard. \n153 INT. TRAIN - NIGHT 153 \nThe train rattles its way through the night. Jean is chatting away, in a better mood than we've seen her for some time. Evelyn listens in silence. \nJEAN The whole thing is actually tremendously exciting. Not just getting on a plane, but getting on a plane and turning left. \nNORMAN Turning left? \nJEAN First class. And home in time for our 40th wedding anniversary. We haven't yet decided how to mark the occasion. \nMADGE Perhaps a minute's silence? \n154 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 154 \nAjit keeps watch, while Muriel is at the printer. Waiting as it disgorges pages. \n155 OMITTED 155 \nSONNY She is no longer my girlfriend. \nEVELYN This is a disaster. \nSONNY Then we must treat it just the same as we would treat a triumph, is that not what your Mr Kipling tells us? Although of course, here we have a problem. Because I, Sunil Indrajit Kapoor, have never had a triumph, so of course I do not know how to treat one. No, all I have had is an constant series of disasters interspersed with the occasional catastrophe, an unending stream of total - \nEVELYN Sonny, do you love her? Sunaina? \nSONNY Most deeply. \nEVELYN Have you told her you love her? \nSONNY It is because I love her that I must not tell her. She can do so much better than me. \nEVELYN And you have told her that? \nSONNY Many times. \nEVELYN Good. Women love it when you say that kind of thing. It's a powerful aphrodisiac. \nSONNY Really? \nEVELYN No, of course not. Go and find her right now, before you lose her forever. Her future is hers to choose, and so is yours. You can have anything you want, Sonny. You just need to stop waiting for someone to tell you you deserve it. Or you can just keep failing yourself, and hurting the ones you love - \nSONNY Mrs Greenslade, stop drilling! You have struck oil! He goes to his bike, climbs on, and rockets off. \n161 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 161 \nMadge is sitting, pensive. Carol comes in. \nMADGE Where's Norman? \nCAROL Packing. \nMADGE But we don't have to leave yet. \nCAROL I asked him to come and stay with me. \nMADGE Is that wise? I'm not sure he's trained. \nCAROL You think it's too soon. \nMADGE It doesn't matter what I think. \nCAROL It is too soon. But at our age we can't afford the luxury of taking it slow. And it's either this or he goes home and I don't want him to go home. Madge looks at her for a while. Then smiles. \nMADGE I wish you both the very best. \nCAROL You haven't met anyone? \nMADGE Single by choice. Just not my choice. \n(BEAT) I actually think it might be over. For me. With men. And if that's gone, I'm not quite sure what's left. \nBEAT \nCAROL Did you know Norman brought pills? The first night he stayed with me? \nMADGE They obviously did the trick. \nCAROL I saw them in his pocket. I didn't want it to be like that. So when I had the chance I swapped them. \n(BEAT) \n(MORE) \n106A. \nCAROL (CONT'D) He went all night on two aspirin. \n(BEAT) It's never over. Norman appears with his one bag and his battery radio. \nNORMAN Ready? \n162 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 162 \nSonny roars through the streets on his bike. \n163 EXT. STREET. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 163 \nEvelyn approaches. She sees a taxi waiting outside the hotel. \nSUNAINA Including your mother? \nJAY \n(TO SONNY) Including my mother? \nSUNAINA His mother. \nJAY \n(TO SONNY) Your mother. \nSONNY I will tell every mother in the land. \nSUNAINA \n(TO JAY) What will you tell them? \nJAY \n(TO SONNY) What will you tell them? \nSONNY The only thing that matters in this world. That I love you. And always will. \n(BEAT) And by you, I mean Sunaina, Jay, not you. Although if you are to be my brother-in-law, I hope we can become better friends. \nSUNAINA Why is he only saying this now? \nJAY \n(TO SUNAINA) You ask him. \nSUNAINA Why are you only saying this now? \nSONNY Because, Sunaina, love of my life, no more will I believe that I am not worthy, for only by loving you as you deserve will I become so. On Sunaina's face as she hears this. \n173 EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 173 \nThe cacophonous sound of drumming: a small band of players are beating out a deafening, syncopated rhythm as the Ganeshi festival begins to unfold. Sonny is on his bike, Sunaina riding side-saddle on the back. They're speeding through the city. Sonny rockets through an arch way up a side street, is confronted by a huge traffic jam. The Ganeshi procession is bringing everything to a standstill. He does a U-turn, speeds off back the way they came. \n174 INT/EXT. TAXI/STREET - DAY 174 \nDouglas and Jean are sitting in the traffic jam. \nDOUGLAS It's funny. They call it rush hour, but nothing actually moves. \n(BEAT) It's not that funny. \n(BEAT) Although I suppose it's all about context, isn't it? I mean - \nJEAN Douglas? \nDOUGLAS Yes? \nJEAN If you say one more word, I'll kill you with my thumbs. \n174A EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 174A \nMuriel sits alone in the courtyard, under her awning. Then Carol and Norman appear from reception, followed by Mrs Kapoor. They cross towards the arch. \nMURIEL Where d'you think you're going? \nMADGE You may well ask. Madge is sitting under the shade of a tree.. \nNORMAN We're moving in together. \nMURIEL Already? \nCAROL That point has been made. \nMRS KAPOOR The hotel is closing. \nMURIEL Doesn't have to. Silence. Everyone stares at Muriel. She takes out the spreadsheets. \nMURIEL (CONT'D) I've been going over the accounts. \n174B EXT. STREET, CENTRAL JAIPUR - DAY 174B \nIf anything, the traffic is now worse. Jean and Douglas's taxi has progressed a few yards, and is now wedged into the arch. The Ganeshi procession is completely blocking the far entrance to the archway. Jean gets out, looks at the sea of unmoving traffic ahead and behind. \nJEAN This is ridiculous. It could go on for hours. There's no way we're ever going to get out of here. \nMADGE What is he saying? \nMURIEL What he said to me, I imagine. She turns to Sunaina. \nMURIEL (CON'TD) Can you help? \nSUNAINA He is saying . he is saying that he has been with this family as long as he can remember. Given them a lifetime of service. And that he remembers another fight, between two young people and their parents. And he remembers the moment where the young man stood up to his mother \nMRS KAPOOR . and said yes, I want to marry this woman. Yes, she is from a different community. But she is smart, she is beautiful, and I love her. Long pause. MRS KAPOOR (cont'd) I don't know who he's talking about. She offers Sunaina her hand. MRS KAPOOR (cont'd) Take care of my favourite son. Sunaina shakes her hand. \nNORMAN So I'm not clear now. Am I staying or going? \nMURIEL Depends how you read the accounts. \nSONNY The accounts? \nMURIEL Turns out the original plan is good, it works. Just not in the hands of an imbecile. \nSONNY I knew that plan was good! \nMURIEL What the place needs is more money. \nSONNY Unfortunately my investor, Mr Maruthi has decided that while he greatly admires my endeavors, he \nCANNOT - \nMURIEL He's reconsidered. \nSONNY You spoke to him? \nMURIEL So long as there is someone to help the manager. \nSONNY The manager needs no help. \nSUNAINA Sonny... \nSONNY The manager needs a little help. \nMURIEL \n(TO NORMAN) So will you stay? Norman looks at Carol. \nNORMAN I'd like to. \nCAROL In the shack on the roof? \nNORMAN I sleep in the trees. \nSONNY \n(TO CAROL) We have a double room. Bathroom ensuite. And a fully working door. He points to Graham's room. \nSONNY (CONT'D) A guest has recently checked out. Madge can't believe he just said that. \nCAROL I'll think about it. \nMURIEL \n(TO MADGE) Mrs Hardcastle ? You're staying. \nMADGE On my own? \nMURIEL You're off your game. Lost your confidence, maybe. But you're a thoroughbred. You'll be back. Madge smiles. \nMURIEL (CON'TD) And what about you, Mrs Greenslade? Evelyn has come down, unnoticed by all. Except Muriel. \nEVELYN What about me, Mrs Donnelly? \nMURIEL We haven't talked much, you and \nI. \nEVELYN My loss, evidently. \n(BEAT) I'm not sure what I should do. Nothing here has quite worked out as I hoped. \n117A. \nMURIEL Most things don't. But sometimes what happens instead is the good stuff. \n(BEAT) \n", "test1_input": "The mellifluous tones continue. Madge mouths the words to herself as she scans the same web-page. \nINDIAN VOICE it exudes historical ambience and is graced with breathtaking surroundings .' \n14 INT. SALON - DAY 14 \nJean whom we earlier saw looking at the bungalow, is at the hairdressers. Her stylist ABI listens to her reading a computer printout for the same hotel. Which looks classy, elegant, and welcoming. Madge's voice bleeds into Jean's. \nJEAN \n(READING) 'Lofty terraces, open courtyards, domes, arches and canopied balconies transport one back in time.' \nABI I wouldn't mind going there myself. \n15 EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY 15 \nIn the background, a train rumbles along the Piccadilly Line towards Heathrow. Douglas, Jean's husband, is on the green with his friend SIMON. Douglas is lining up a tricky putt. \nSIMON There won't be any golf courses. \nDOUGLAS Just as well. I can't afford the green fees. \nSIMON But a retirement home? Douglas misses his putt. \nDOUGLAS It's a luxury development, where all the residents are in their golden years. \nSIMON Like the Costa Brava. \nDOUGLAS Yes. But with more elephants. Simon holes out. \n16 INT. JUDGES CHAMBERS - DAY 16 \nGraham, the judge, is in his office. It's nearly empty; his entire life is being packed away. His friend Giles watches him put more things in boxes. \nGILES How long have we known each other? And you've never once talked about India. \nGRAHAM D'you want these books? \nGILES You might need them again. Graham smiles at him, calls out. \nGRAHAM Mrs Megson! His cleaner, MRS MEGSON, comes in. \nMRS MEGSON Sir? Graham takes a beautiful vase off the shelf, gives it to her. \nGRAHAM I want you to have this. \nMRS MEGSON Are you sure? \nGRAHAM Absolutely. There's a slight crack on the bottom. But I think you might know something about that already. Mrs Megson goes. \nGRAHAM (CONT'D) I used to live there. A long time ago. \n17 INT. BASEMENT BEDSIT. EARLS COURT - DAY 17 \nA bedsit. Slightly down at heel, and sparsely furnished. Norman, whom we met speed dating, is talking to someone. We don't see who. Quietly, in the background, Radio 2 music from an old battery radio. \nNORMAN I have to go. I do. And I could say I wish you'd come, but I've never lied to you. We both know I need more than you can offer. We know that. Don't we? We see who's sitting in front of him. An ancient dachshund. \nNORMAN (CONT'D) (to the dog) Don't make that face at me. Norman's Polish landlady, MRS JELLINEK, is at the door. \nMRS JELLINEK (to her dog) You. Upstairs. The dog hops off the chair, and leaves. Norman watches him go. MRS JELLINEK (cont'd) Any warm clothes you have use for no more, I take them. And not forget to leave keys when you go. She leaves. Norman is left alone. \nNORMAN I'll miss you too. \n18 EXT. HOUSING ESTATE - DAY 18 \nThe district ambulance driver, JACKSON, is pushing Muriel in a wheelchair across a housing estate. \nMURIEL You know who'll be there, don't you? Indians. Loads of them, A sea of brown faces and black hearts, all greasy haired and reeking of spices. Never see one on their own, do you? No, becuase they hunt in packs. All the better to rob me blind and - \nJACKSON You know what? You can take it from here. \nMURIEL You're supposed to see me into my flat. That's what they said. \nJACKSON My wife is from Mumbai. He heads off. Muriel shouts after him. \nMURIEL No good moaning to me, mate. You married her! But he's gone. Muriel wheels herself on over the bumpy ground. \n19 EXT. PASSENGER DROP-OFF. STANSTED AIRPORT - EVENING 19 \nA reluctant Christopher is pushing a trolley carrying Evelyn's cases to the terminal. \n", "test1_true": "EVELYN They should be. The hotel paid for them. I'm sure they'd rather have us there than not. And its fantastically cheap for the first three months. \nCHRISTOPHER I wonder why. They walk on in silence. \nCHRISTOPHER (CONT'D) How will we know you're alright? \nEVELYN I'll call. They do have phones there, you know. Or you can just read my blog. \nCHRISTOPHER Your what? \nEVELYN On the interweb. You can log in whenever you like, read my news. \nCHRISTOPHER I just hope the first item will be announcing your return. I don't suppose they'll be paying for the journey back...? Evelyn stops. They've reached the terminal. \nEVELYN Could you please, before I go, say one thing that is supportive? Because I've never done anything like this before. \nCHRISTOPHER Without Dad, you never did anything at all. And i don't think you'll be able to cope. \nEVELYN Well. I suppose we'll find out, won't we? They head into the building. \n20 INT. CHECK-IN AREA. AIRPORT - EVENING 20 \nMadge is at the First Class Check-In desk. \nMADGE And the connecting flight to Jaipur is first class too? The check-in girl nods, hands Madge back her passport. \nMADGE (CONT'D) I tell you, it's tough to get upgraded nowadays. I had to flirt so hard with the travel agent, it was practically phone sex. \n21 INT. SECURITY AREA. AIRPORT - EVENING 21 \nThe light is fading. \n15A. Norman appears to be relishing a detailed search from a female Security Guard. \nNORMAN Come on. Thorough as you like Muriel is waiting to collect her bag from the belt. \nSECURITY GUARD We'd like to take a look in this bag, Madam, if you don't mind. He lifts the bag onto a table. It's heavier than he thought. \nSECURITY GUARD (cont'd) What you got in here anyway? He opens the bag, stares in astonishment. \nMURIEL PG Tips. Brown sauce. Ten jars of Marmite. Thirty one packets of Chocolate Hobnobs. Pickled onions. Pickled eggs. And pickle. \nSECURITY GUARD No liquids on the plane. \nMURIEL What does that mean? \nSECURITY GUARD It means you can't take the pickled onions. Or the pickled eggs. \n(BEAT) The pickle's fine. \n22 INT. BOARDING GATE. AIRPORT - EVENING/NIGHT 22 \nThe passengers from Flight 1045 to Delhi are seated at the gate, waiting to board. Muriel is wheeled up by an attendant and parked at the end of the only remaining row of empty chairs. Douglas and Jean are already sitting there. Jean smiles politely as Graham sits down a couple of seats away. Norman arrives, carrying his battery radio, sees an empty place between Jean and Madge, who is sitting at the end. He smiles knowingly at Madge as he sits. Finally Evelyn takes the only available space, between Graham and Douglas. And there the seven passengers wait patiently, unaware of their common fate. The sound of a jet engine, quiet at first, finally engulfs them. \n23 EXT. RUNWAY. INDIA - DAWN 23 \nThe plane cruises down through a stunning sunset, and lands at Delhi Airport. \n24 INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL, DELHI - DAY 24 \nEvelyn, Douglas, Jean and Graham are descending on an escalator. Madge is a few steps up. \nJEAN Obviously one's read one's Kipling, but we view this as an opportunity to explore another culture, as well as making new friends. And a retired judge is just the class of guest one was hoping for, isn't it Douglas? \nDOUGLAS I'm sorry? \nGRAHAM \n(TO EVELYN) And is this your first time in India? \nJEAN You don't seem like an experienced traveller. \nEVELYN I'm not. Although one has read one's guidebooks. Jean blinks. Evelyn and Graham share a smile. Douglas hides his. And Madge sees it all. As they head towards the baggage carousel, they're met by Muriel and Norman, emerging from the elevator. Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair. \nNORMAN Norman Cousins. \nMADGE Madge Hardcastle. A pleasure. \nNORMAN Play your cards right, it could be. Madge stares at him. A voice comes over the tannoy. \n", "test2_input": "AIRPORT ANNOUNCER Ladies and gentlemen, we regret to inform you that owing to bad weather, Flight 105 to Jaipur has been cancelled. The airline is happy to arrange \nCUT TO: \n25 INT. AIRPORT. DELHI - DAY 25 \nHours later. The airport is deserted, except for the Marigold Hotel party, who sit slumped and exhausted on another row of seats, with Muriel's wheelchair at the other end. After a moment, Graham says \nGRAHAM Alright. Plan B. \n26 INT. DELHI AIRPORT - DAY 26 \nMoments later. They're all moving briskly through the hi- tech, ultra-modern, beautifully air-conditioned building. \nJEAN Of course it's a good idea. Who can you trust if not a High Court Judge? \nDOUGLAS And this way we see more of the country. Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair. \nNORMAN (leaning down, to \nMURIEL) If anyone asks, say you're my mother. I don't want people to think we're together. \nMURIEL In your dirty dreams. \nJEAN Douglas, these are not words that often pass my lips, but you may actually be right. The country seems to be rather more civilised than one originally thought. \n27 EXT. DELHI BUS STATION - EVENING 27 \nMoments later. Our heroes are in the middle of an extraordinary scene. Stifling heat, deafening noise; the chaos, the bustle, the grime, the crowds, the life. They're surrounded by taxi drivers, baggage handlers,beggars etc. All clamouring for their attention. Evelyn looks a little shocked. Jean is traumatized, a handkerchief to her face. \nGraham, at the ticket booth, triumphantly holds up a fistful of tickets. \nGRAHAM (shouting over the din) The bus will drop us in the centre of town. We can take tuk- tuks the rest of the way! They follow him through the hordes. And see their bus. It's absolutely rammed. People are practically hanging out of the windows. \nMADGE There's not enough room. \nGRAHAM It's time to prove the first and only rule of India: there's always room. He starts to fight his way to the door. Evelyn's at the back. She stops, for a moment, looks around her. \nEVELYN What larks, Pip. Douglas is just ahead of her. He turns, smiles. \nDOUGLAS Let's hope so. \n28 EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING 28 \nMuriel's wheelchair is strapped to the back of the bus, which is screaming down the six-lane highway. A huge tower of luggage is piled precariously on the roof. The road appears to be complete chaos; cars, buses, even cows overtaking each other. The bus pulls into the outside lane to follow a truck which is overtaking some slower vehicles. As the truck pulls back into the inside lane, it reveals a huge truck barrelling towards them on the wrong carriageway. Norman, sitting at the front, screams his last scream... \nNORMAN \nNOOOOOOO... . U At the last minute, the bus pulls back into the inside lane. The Indians on the bus take absolutely no notice. \n29 INT. BUS - EVENING 29 \nNorman is grinning from ear to ear. \nNORMAN I'm loving this! Evelyn is sitting next to Madge. \nEVELYN A few months ago I was organising the church flowers. \nMADGE Are you struggling with the feeling you're not in control of your circumstances? \nEVELYN A little. \nMADGE You know what the shortest prayer in the world is? \nEVELYN No. \nMADGE Fuck it. Evelyn laughs. \nMADGE (CONT'D) You're not doing the church flowers any more. May as well enjoy the ride. Douglas is watching a nice Indian family. They're having a picnic. The father notices Douglas looking, offers him some food. Douglas makes the namaste gesture, takes some happily. \nJEAN Are you insane? \"Avoid all food not from a reputable vendor, it will have been washed with impure water.\" Douglas keeps eating, with great enjoyment. \nDOUGLAS It's just a sandwich. \nJEAN Marvellous. Then I'll have the ham, cheese, and streptococcus, please. Or perhaps the bacteria, lettuce and tomato. Douglas turns to Muriel. \nDOUGLAS Would you like some of this? I believe it's aloo ka paratha. \nMURIEL If I can't pronounce it, I'm not eating it. The cacophony of horns continues. Jean screams, as another collision looms. \n30 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK 30 \n", "test2_true": "31 INT. BUS - NIGHT 31 \nEveryone is asleep, or trying to sleep. Except Muriel. She reaches into her bag, and carefully removes a biscuit. She surreptitiously lifts it to her mouth, and starts to chew. Madge has fallen asleep on Evelyn's shoulder. But Evelyn is still awake, as is Graham. \nEVELYN How long since you were here? \nGRAHAM Forty years. \nEVELYN As long as I was married. \n(BEAT) He died recently. My husband. \nGRAHAM I'm sorry. \nEVELYN D'you think we're going to be alright? \nGRAHAM God, don't ask me. I'm more scared than you are. They both smile, sit in silence for a bit. \nGRAHAM (CONT'D) Yes. I think it's going to be extraordinary. \n32 EXT. BUS - DAWN 32 \nThe sun rises. A beautiful, pearly dawn. The bus drives through the great gates of Jaipur. Below, the city shimmers in the heat. It's a magnificent sight. \nEVELYN (O.S.) What exactly is a tuk-tuk? \n33 EXT. JAIPUR STREET - DAWN 33 \nOur heroes are squashed into a pair of them, facing forwards and backwards, attempting not to swallow too much dust as they wheel crazily through the teeming morning streets of the city. They stare in amazement at the world racing past them. A scooter overtakes. A young man is driving, his girlfriend riding side-saddle on the back. Her sari billows out behind her. Douglas and Evelyn both watch her, struck by this image of beauty, youth and vitality. \n34 EXT. STREET/GARDEN PATH. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34 \nThe tuk-tuks have pulled up, and our travellers emerge, exhausted and dirty, staring through some garden gates at the Marigold Hotel. Once a beautiful building, once possibly even luxurious, it is clearly in the process of being given at least half the face-lift it badly needs. Parts of the building are freshly painted, some of the ornate balconies are crumbling, and one wall is clad with crazily skewed bamboo scaffolding. A huge old tree towers over an untended garden, its branches poking into the windows of the building. \n34A EXT. ROOFTOP. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34A \nA young man leans out from an upper balcony to see the arrival below: SONNY KAPOOR (early 20's). He deposits a paint pot and brush on a parapet, and races off across the rooftop. \n34B EXT. GARDEN PATH/COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34B \nDazed and horrified, the travellers wander up the pathway. A cow standing in front of them is pushed into the garden by a couple of young houseboys who then run to the tuk-tuks to collect their luggage. \n34C EXT. STAIRWAY/COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34C \nSonny clatters down the steep steps, and comes tearing out onto a verandah, as the travellers arrive in the courtyard below. He spreads his arms wide. \nSONNY Welcome to India!!! They stare up at him. \n35 EXT/INT. COURTYARD/HALLWAY.BEDROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 35 \nThe courtyard is not without charm, although somewhat delapidated. A fountain at the centre does not look as if it has seen water in years, and faded awnings are strung up haphazardly. Sonny is leading Madge into the darkness of the building, towards her room. \nSONNY This is a building of the utmost character, which means that perhaps not everything will function in the way you expect it to. But as the manager and chief executive supervising officer of the Marigold Hotel, I can tell you with great pride that the building has stood for centuries, and will stand for many more, in 100% shipshape condition. Please follow me, carefully avoiding that naughty stone there round this corner, leading us most successfully all the way to . your bedroom! The room is very small, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. But there's no door. \nMADGE Where? \nSONNY Here. In here. \nMADGE My dear man. Rooms have doors. What you're showing me here is an alcove. \nSONNY The door is coming soon, most definitely. \nMADGE How soon? \nSONNY Let us not concern ourselves with details, Mrs Hardcastle. Rather than speaking of doors, we should instead take pleasure in the freedom to roam. \nMADGE Does your room have a door? \nSONNY Oh yes. \nMADGE Then that's where I'll be staying. \n36 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 36 \nDouglas and Jean arrive at their room. Douglas goes in through the arched doorway, promptly comes back out again. \nDOUGLAS Bird in the room! Bird in the room! Jean pushes him aside, goes on in. Several pigeons are flying around in some panic. \n37 EXT/INT. VERANDAH/BEDROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 37 \n", "test3_input": "SONNY A great amount. Plenty of rooms, no question. They've arrived in the courtyard. \nSONNY (CONT'D) I am not a details man, Mr Maruthi. \nMR MARUTHI Nor was your father. They see Muriel on her verandah. \nSONNY Mr Maruthi, I present to you one of our beloved guests. Dear Mrs Donnelly, please describe in as much detail as you desire your experience of the ambience and atmosphere of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. \nMURIEL Kill me. Kill me now. Sonny steers Mr Maruthi towards the reception, speaks quietly. \nSONNY The wheel is spinning. But the hamster is dead. He stops, as he sees an elegant older woman standing in the doorway. This is the redoubtable MRS KAPOOR. \nSONNY (CONT'D) Mummyji! What are you doing here? \nMRS KAPOOR You called. I came. \nSONNY I couldn't have called. The phones don't work. \nMRS KAPOOR That's why I came. \n78 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 78 \nMoments later. Sonny closes the door behind him. His mother starts going through the contents of his desk. \nMRS KAPOOR Who was that man out there? \nSONNY The contents of this desk are mine. Don't open the drawers. I must insist you don't open the drawer. Mrs Kapoor opens the drawer. \nSONNY (CONT'D) Tell me why you have come. \nMRS KAPOOR Do I need a reason to visit my favourite son? \nSONNY No. He is in his mansion in Delhi. \nMRS KAPOOR My second favourite. \nSONNY He went to Kerala to make his fortune. \nMRS KAPOOR But make it, he did. \nSONNY As I will make mine. I have a dream, Mummyji. A most brilliant one: to out-source old age. And not just for the British. There are many other countries where they don't like old people too. \nMRS KAPOOR Your brothers own a third of the hotel each, they are entitled to a third of the profits. \nSONNY Success does not happen overnight, Mummyji. This is blue sky thinking, and it requires long-term strategy and patience. \nMRS KAPOOR How is your girlfriend? \nSONNY I look forward to you meeting her. \nMRS KAPOOR And I look forward to you meeting the woman you will marry. She is from a good family in Delhi. \nSONNY I can marry as I choose, Mummyji. I need no permission. \nMRS KAPOOR I presume it is your girlfriend who teaches you such nonsense. One reason not to marry her. \nSONNY What if I love her? \nMRS KAPOOR An even better reason. Now send Young Wasim to the car for my luggage. \nSONNY He cannot carry, he has a dicky back ... wait, your luggage? How long are you staying? \nMRS KAPOOR As long as it takes. \n79 INT. BATHROOM. DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S. MARIGOLD HOTEL - 79 \nDAY Jean is looking out of her bathroom window, down into the courtyard. She sees Graham come out of his room. She turns back to the mirror, looks at herself. \n80 EXT. MURIEL'S TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 80 \nNear to Muriel, Anokhi is sweeping the floor. \nMURIEL You won't get the dirt out like that. Anokhi just smiles at her radiantly. \nMURIEL (CONT'D) I worked in service for years, looked after a lovely house. I kept it spotless. You need a bit more pressure on that brush. Graham walks past, on his way out. \nGRAHAM She won't speak English. She's what used to be called an Untouchable. An outcast, born below society. To a good Hindu, even her shadow is polluted. He greets Anokhi in Hindi, and heads for the door. \nMURIEL Where d'you go every day? Is it a woman? Nip round there for a curry and a bit of afters? \nGRAHAM I don't think so. I'm gay. Although nowadays more in theory than practice. Good day. He leaves. A moment later, Jean comes rushing out. Immediately she realises two things; first, that Graham has already gone. And second, that Muriel is watching her. \n", "test3_true": "JEAN (CONT'D) Lovely day. Still nothing from Muriel. \nJEAN (CONT'D) Lovely. \n(BEAT) Lovely. She turns and goes back in. Muriel thinks for a while, then turns to Anokhi. \nMURIEL Long old life, isn't it? \n81 EXT. VICEROY CLUB - DAY 81 \nA classic colonial building, straight out of the English Raj. Madge is being shown around by an elderly secretary, MR \nDHARUNA. \nMR DRARUNA The Viceroy Club was opened by the great Lord Kitchener himself, and many of the fixtures have remained unchanged since then. \nMADGE Yes, I see that. Perhaps you could tell me a little about the clientele? Any maharajahs? Wealthy widowed land-owners? \nMR DHARUNA It is not the policy of this club to divulge details of our members. They go past a very handsome older Indian man. Who radiates wealth and privilege. \nMR DHARUNA (cont'd) Good morning, Your Excellency. \nMADGE Where do I sign up? \nMR DHARUNA The admission fee is 120,000 rupees, and thereafter 15,000 rupees each month. \nMADGE I wonder if I might get a little discount. Owing to my status. \nMR DHARUNA Your status, madam? \nMADGE Yes. One was rather hoping to fly under the radar, but one is a member of the Royal Family. \nMR DHARUNA Which member, madam? \nMADGE I'm Princess Margaret. \nMR DHARUNA \n(BOWING SLIGHTLY) It is most surely an honour to meet you. And may I say how well you look. Especially taking into account that you died nine years ago. \n(BEAT) Your real name please, madam. And 120,000 rupees. \n82 INT. PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE - DAY 82 \nGraham comes into the chaotic office. The bookish official, MR CHIDAMBRAM, is behind the desk. \nGRAHAM Good morning. \nMR CHIDAMBRAM Good morning, Sir. Did I not say that we will contact you when there is information regarding your inquiry? \nGRAHAM Yes, you did say that. You did. \nMR CHIDAMBRAM While it is most pleasant to see you, your presence does not actually accelerate our investigation. \nGRAHAM I'll try not to come in tomorrow. \nMR CHIDAMBRAM I expect I will see you then. \n83 INT. CALL CENTRE - DAY 83 \nNone of the operators are on the phone. Instead they are sitting in a semi-circle, looking curiously at Evelyn. Who is sitting next to Jay, a little daunted by the attention. \nEVELYN .You ring in the morning. Let's assume the person answering will be a woman. She will have had her breakfast. Tea or coffee. Semi-skimmed milk, always. If she's under 50 she'll be contemplating yet another diet, over 50 she'll have more or less given up, and be eating toast. The radio may be playing, or more likely daytime TV. A chat show, or a programme with a moderator speaking to a panel of young women whose boyfriends have all slept with their mothers. The girlfriends' mothers, I mean, not their own. Although Anyway, then the boyfriends usually come out, and everybody fights. Sunaina is in the audience. She calls out. \nSUNAINA I'm not surprised people hang up on us. Laughter. \nEVELYN That's the point. When the phone rings and it's this robot nobody wants a machine, but it's almost worse when it's a person behaving like one. All these sales cliches just strung together. 'Your call is important to us'. Is it? Well then sound like it. \nSUNAINA 'Your custom is valuable'. \nEVELYN Right. That one. Don't ever say that. \nSUNAINA 'Service is our middle name'. \nEVELYN Yes, when your middle name is \nACTUALLY \nSUNAINA Shantanu. \n"}

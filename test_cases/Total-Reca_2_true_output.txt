Quail does keep his gun trained on the man.  The man enters, holding in his outstretched hand -- a business card. 
EDGEMAR My card, Mr. Quail. 
Quail frisks him, then takes the card, glances at it. 
QUAIL Okay -- so you're Doctor George Edgemar of 'Rekall, Inc.'  So? 
EDGEMAR As I said... this is going to be very difficult -- for both of us. 
QUAIL I'm listening. 
EDGEMAR Mr. Quail... I'm afraid you're not really standing here at this moment. 
QUAIL Sat that again. 
EDGEMAR I said, you're not really here.  Neither am I.  We're both in the Memory Studio -- in the offices of Rekall, Inc. On Earth. 
Long pause. 
QUAIL Are you trying to tell me that this is all part of some... artificially injected fantasy? That I never really left Earth? 
EDGEMAR No, not quite.  We didn't give you this.  You're creating it yourself -- (pauses, choosing his words) Remember the option we offered you?  Intelligence agent? Something inside you liked that idea, fastened on it. What you're experiencing now is a free-form delusion that you yourself are fabricating. 
QUAIL What is this shit you're giving me? 
EDGEMAR This is not -- shit, Mr. Quail. It's the truth. (beat) I know it's very hard for you to accept, but you're having a schizophrenic reaction... we can't snap you out of the Narkadine.  You're in a world of your own fantasy. 
QUAIL Then how the hell can you be in my dream -- if you know it's just a dream? 
EDGEMAR I've been artificially implanted -- like the first part of your fantasy.  I'm actually monitoring your dream at a psychoprobe console. This is a last resort.  When somebody gets stuck in their own fantasy, we send in someone after them.  A specialist, like myself. 
QUAIL I don't believe a word you're saying. 
EDGEMAR I was afraid you'd think that. I'm sorry to have to do this, but you really are stuck. (calls out) Doctor Noel, would you come in now please? 
The door starts to open.  Quail pivots and points his gun at the opening door. 
MELINA walks in, carrying a CLIPBOARD.  She looks at Quail with professional detachment. 
MELINA Yes, Mr. Quail, I'm afraid it's all true. 
Quail is staggered. 
MELINA (continuing) I tried to break through to you earlier, but you just molded me into your fantasy. Sometimes it takes Dr. Edgemar to get through to a client as tough as you. 
QUAIL (wavering) So what's supposed to happen now? 
EDGEMAR Just do exactly as we tell you. 
QUAIL (stares at him coldly) Somehow that doesn't appeal to me. 
MELINA Please, Mr. Quail... try to cooperate.  You're having a schizophrenic embolism. 
EDGEMAR If we can't get you out now... you may never come out of it. Your wife calls every day -- 
CLOSE - QUAIL 
Even more suspicious. 
TWO SHOT - QUAIL AND EDGEMAR

TONY Take his legs. 
SAM Run your hands under hot water. 
MRS. CARMICHAEL comes in. 
MRS. CARMICHAEL I have some ice from the machine. 
JEZZIE Bring it in. 
MRS. CARMICHAEL Is he all right? 
JEZZIE He doesn't like it. 
MRS. CARMICHAEL I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice? 
JEZZIE Pour it in. 
MRS. CARMICHAEL On top of him? 
JEZZIE He's melting it as fast as we dump it in. 
MRS. CARMICHAEL Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy. 
TONY helps her pour the ice into the water. JACOB yells. 
JACOB Oh God! You're killing me! Stop! 
INT.  A BEDROOM - NIGHT 
CUT TO JACOB lying in a BEDROOM we have not seen before. He is tossing and turning in his bed as though struggling to get out. Suddenly he sits up and looks over at the window. It is open and the shade is flapping. Cold air is blowing in and he is shivering. 
JACOB Damn! You and your fresh air. 
He jumps out of bed and goes over to the window. He pushes at the frame and it comes flying down with a loud bang. A woman in the bed sits up. It is SARAH. 
SARAH What was that? 
JACOB It's freezing. 
SARAH I'm not cold. 
JACOB Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed. 
SARAH It's not healthy with it closed. 
JACOB This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy. 
He settles back into bed and pulls the covers back over to his side. He lies quietly for a moment, thinking. 
JACOB (continuing) What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was? 
SARAH I don't want to know. 
JACOB Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice. 
SARAH Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind? 
JACOB She was good in bed, though. 
SARAH Go to sleep. 
JACOB She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious. 
SARAH I thought you said it was a nightmare? 
Suddenly, out of nowhere, we hear the tinkling sound of a music box. A YOUNG BOY enters the room, carrying a musical LUNCH BOX in his arms. He is wearing a long T-shirt nearly down to his ankles. We recognize him from his photograph. It is GABE. 
GABE Daddy, what was that noise? 
JACOB (surprised to see him) Gabe? (he stares curiously at his son) What are you doing ... ? 
GABE There was a bang. 
JACOB It was the window. 
GABE It's cold. 
JACOB Tell your mother. 
GABE Mom, it's ... 
SARAH I heard you. Go back to sleep. 
GABE Will you tuck me in? 
SARAH (not happily) Oh ... all right. 
She starts to rise. JACOB stops her and gets up instead. He whisks GABE upside down and carries him into his

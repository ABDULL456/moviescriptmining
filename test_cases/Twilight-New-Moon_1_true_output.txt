BELLA No hating on the truck.     Thank you, Emmett. 
ALICE Open mine. 
Alice hands her a box.   Bella starts to open it, but -- 
BELLA Ouch - paper cut. 
CLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGER - A single drop of deep red blood appears. 
Bella thinks little of it, but then HEARS a disturbing, grisly SNARL -- she looks up just as -- 
BELLA'S POV - JASPER lunges toward her!    Teeth bared, eyes beyond reason -- 
-- Edward FLINGS Bella behind his own body, causing her to CRASH into the table, plates shattering as -- 
-- Jasper SLAMS into Edward; sounds like boulders colliding. 
-- Edward pushes him, hard; Jasper SAILS backward, hitting the wall. But he RICOCHETS off it and comes back at Bella. 
-- Emmett and Carlisle TACKLE Jasper from the side, dragging him to the ground -- Alice helps hold him down -- 
ALICE (soothingly) Jaz... shhh -- 
... But she stops, her head suddenly jerking toward Bella. Then everybody's eyes snap toward Bella as they catch the overwhelming scent -- 
ON BELLA - lying amid the shards of broken china. She looks at her arm, seeing now - it's been slashed by plate shards; bright red blood pulses out of her, pooling. She looks up -- 
BELLA'S POV - THE CULLENS (SLOW MOTION) 
All of them now, including Edward (but not Carlisle) stare down at her, at her blood, with fevered eyes. Six suddenly ravenous vampires... 
SLOW MOTION ABRUPTLY ENDS as -- Carlisle jumps to Bella's side. Edward, though white as a bone, snaps out of it and stands between her and the others. 
CARLISLE Emmett, get Jasper out of here. (no response) Emmett. 
Emmett reins himself in, elbows Rosalie. They drag the snarling Jasper out. Esme holds her nose, politely exits with the others. Alice looks at Bella, apologetic -- 
ALICE I'm sorry, I... can't... 
She slips out the door.   Edward's still on guard as Carlisle examines Bella's arm. 
CARLISLE I'll have to stitch this up. 
EDWARD I'll carry her to the kitchen. 
He moves to pick her up, but his eyes dart to the blood. 
CARLISLE I'll take care of her, Edward. (Edward doesn't move) Check on Jasper. Go. 
Edward looks from him to Bella. Then steps back, allowing Carlisle to lift Bella and carry her to the kitchen. But just before the kitchen door closes, Bella sees Edward's agonized face. He turns away, unable to meet her eyes... 
INT. CULLEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Bella sits in a chair opposite Carlisle who mops up her blood as he removes glass shards from her arm. He drops one into a bowl; PLINK. She tries not to look at the blood. BELLA I sure can kill a party. 
CARLISLE It's not your fault. Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us. 
BELLA Seems like you're the only one it doesn't effect. 
CARLISLE Centuries of practice. 
BELLA Did you ever think of... living differently? 
CARLISLE I enjoy   my work too much. Helping people,   saving lives. I'm hoping there's   a point to my existence, even if I am   damned. 
BELLA Damned?    You're not damned. 
CARLISLE Then you and I agree. But Edward doesn't believe there's an afterlife for our kind. (looking at her) He thinks we've lost our souls. 
BELLA (realizing) That's why he won't... He thinks he'd be damning me. 
CARLISLE (CONT'D) If you believed as he did, would you risk it? 
Off Bella, no, not ever... 
INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT 
A large red bow hangs from the new stereo in the dashboard. Edward drives in silence. Bella studies him. Finally -- 
BELLA Say something. EDWARD What do you want me to say? 
BELLA That I'm a klutz. That I should have been more careful -- 
EDWARD You got a paper cut. Normal people get paper cuts. And a normal boyfriend wouldn't have flung you into a stack of plates. A normal boyfriend wouldn't have had to fight the urge to kill you --

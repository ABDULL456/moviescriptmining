{"train": "ABSOLUTE POWER \nWritten by WILLIAM GOLDMAN \nBased on the book by DAVID BALDACCI \nMay 1996 Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nFADE IN: \n1   INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY                                   1 \nThe saddest eyes you ever saw. \nWe are looking at an El Greco drawing.       It is a study for one of his paintings. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL -- \nA bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes, the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so brilliantly. \nMost of the students are around 20.        A couple of suburban housewives are there too. \nAnd one older man. \nThis is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a successful company executive. \nAs we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss nothing: He has pilot's eyes. \nWe'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the hero of this piece. As we watch him draw -- \nLuther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff. \nLuther. It's not good enough for him.        He looks at his work a moment, shakes his head. \nGIRL STUDENT Don't give up. \nLUTHER I never do. \nGIRL STUDENT May I? \nShe's indicated his sketchbook.      He nods.   She starts thumbing through. \nThe sketchbook as the pages turn. \nDetail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good.         The hands are better. Very skillful. \n(CONTINUED) \n)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                         2. \n1     CONTINUED:                                                    1 \nThe GIRL hands it back.    Impressed. \nGIRL STUDENT You work with your hands, don't you? \nCLOSEUP - LUTHER                                                  * \nAn enigmatic smile.    Now, from that -- \n2     EXT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                          2 \nA nice working class part of town. Nothing fancy here but there's a pleasant feel. The streets are clean, the houses neat and well tended. \nLuther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S. \n3     INT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                       3 \nLuther walks in. Nothing fancy here. Strictly working class. And relatively empty. An overweight bald man Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED. They are good enough friends not to ask each other questions. \nLUTHER (as they nod to each other) Redhead. \nRED Luther. (as Luther hands him a videotape) Your life would be a whole lot simpler if you could learn to operate a V.C.R. \nLUTHER My only failing. \nAs he turns -- \n4     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                   4 \nA street of   small row houses. Clean, well tended. Luther walks   toward one. Later in the afternoon. He carries half   a dozen small shopping bags, from the market, the   hardware store, the drug store, the cleaners. \n5   EXT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                                    5 \nA terra cotta planter to the right of the front door. Luther shifts his packages, tilts the planter slightly, bends down, pulls out a key, inserts it in the front door. \n6   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                          6 \nas he enters. Neat, tidy. A Cuisinart, a cheese slicer, lots of other nice equipment. As he begins putting food away -- \n7   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - NIGHT                    7 \nEvening now. Table set for one. A single candle. Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it down. \nA gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass. Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner. \nLuther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at them happily. It's Luther. When he was young. \nLuther studies the photo a moment.    Then he turns, looks out the window. \n8   POV SHOT - SLIVER OF MOON                                    8 \nis visible.     Lovely.   Peaceful. \n9   LUTHER                                                       9 \nNow Luther opens the sketch pad, quickly flips past the hands and eyes and faces -- \n-- we are looking at something totally different:   a mansion. \nFour, three, two -- \nCUT TO: \n24   FACE OF TINY COMPUTER                                      24 \nas five numbers lock -- 7 -- 13 -- 19 -- 8 -- 11 -- \nThe BEEPING sound dies. \nCUT TO: \n25   LUTHER                                                     25 \nA glance across the foyer -- the lights of the security detector go from red to a warm looking green. \nSafe. \n(CONTINUED) \n25    CONTINUED:                                                   25 \nHe allows himself to exhale. Then he's busy again, unhooking the computer. His fingers, as always, work quickly, precisely. \n25A   INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT                        25A \nThe foyer as Luther, once again carrying his backpack, moves across it. Behind him, the front door is again shut, the security panel back on, screws all in place. \nIt's as if he hadn't been there at all... \n26    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT                    26 \nLuther walks quickly up -- and here we get a sense of the vast size of the place -- it feels bigger inside than it looked in the moonlight. \nA Van Gogh at the head of the stairs. Luther moves past it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. It's a late one, when the madness had him and things were sliding away. Very sad. \nLuther looks at it admiringly for another moment -- \n-- then surprisingly he raises his hand,  and for just an instant traces the lines of the painting  in the air, as if trying to figure out how the magic was  done, as if getting ready for his next museum session  -- \n-- then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the third floor. \n27    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - THIRD-FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT          27 \nHere's a Hopper. One of the great ones, filled with an overpowering sense of being alone -- \n-- Luther stares at it almost in awe, whispers \"wow,\" moves on. \n28    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT                      28 \nLuther, walking down the third-floor corridor. \nThe corridor walls. No paintings here -- instead we see a series of framed photographs. The first is of a baby girl, the next one of the same child at three. \nWe watch the child grow up in these photos.    At ten she is already pretty. At fifteen a stunner.

The kind of girl you ached for in high school. The perfect cheerleader. \nThese are pictures, we will come to know, of Christy Sullivan. A high school graduation shot at eighteen, a shot in front of a Burger King at twenty. \nCLOSEUP - WEDDING PHOTOGRAPH                                     * \nChristy, looking just fabulous, is 24 and smiling happily. We can only see her face and the wedding veil here. Now -- \nPULL BACK to reveal -- \nA glorious and expensive white wedding dress.    Christy holds a bouquet of flowers. Breathtaking. \nKEEP PULLING BACK. \nAnd now we can see the groom. Walter Sullivan. Walter is smiling too, one arm proudly around his lovely bride. \nWalter, it might be noted, is eighty years old. \nLuther, staring at the photo, shakes his head.    Now he moves on. \n29    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT              29 \nLuther opens the DOOR. It SQUEAKS. He goes inside, closes the door firmly. Next, he puts his backpack down, takes out a low-power non-glare work light, sets it up. Now he looks around. A huge room, a gigantic canopied bed. \nA nightstand alongside, which contains a small silver clock, three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop the other, several more photos of the happy couple -- \n-- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a thick leather handle. \nLuther. He studies himself in front of a very large full-length mirror across from the canopied bed. \nNow we realize something -- he isn't studying himself, he's studying the mirror itself. \nHe turns, goes to the sitting area where there are chairs and a sofa and a large TV and VCR. \n(CONTINUED) \n29   CONTINUED:                                                   29 \nThree remotes on a side table. Luther carefully picks up the middle one, crosses the room with it, points it at the large mirror, clicks once -- \n-- and the mirror swings silently open. \nA room is revealed. All we can see of it so far is this: There is an armchair in the middle facing where the mirror had been. \nLuther turns back toward the sitting area, the remote held in his hand. \nThe side table. Luther puts the remote down -- very carefully. In the exact position it had been. Now he takes a moment, blows on his hands, rubs them together. \nThen -- Luther takes a collapsible duffel bag out of his backpack, moves with the work light into the revealed room -- \n30   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - VAULT - NIGHT                 30 \n(CONTINUED) \n79   CONTINUED:                                                  79 \nThe watch face is illuminated in the darkness. The second hand is fifteen seconds away from the top. \nLuther takes a deep breath, waits in silence. \nThe WATCH face:   the sound is loud, like \"60 Minutes.\" \n80   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                    80 \nBurton and Russell moving with Richmond toward one of the cars. Burton takes the man in his arms, leaving Russell free to open the back door. \nCollin dumps the plastic bag into the trunk, shuts it, moves quickly so that he can get a decent view of the road. \nThe road in front of the house. Empty. Collin hurries to the Towncar where Burton is struggling to get Richmond comfortably stretched out on the back seat. \n81   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                 81 \nThe second hand on Luther's watch hits the top and he moves into action. \n-- He points the clicker at the door -- \n-- the door starts to swing open -- \n-- Luther, backpack in hand, strides quickly into the bedroom, turns, points the clicker again and as the door starts to swing shut -- Luther carefully tosses the clicker back inside. \n82   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - ARMCHAIR - NIGHT                      82 \nas the clicker lands -- dead-solid perfect -- \n83   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                        83 \nLuther, in the bedroom, moving to the nightstand, carrying his backpack -- \n-- he slows as he circles the body of Christy Sullivan, looks sadly down at her, continues on as we MOVE TO... \n(CONTINUED) \n)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                         25. \n83    CONTINUED:                                                  83 \nThe bed table. First, Luther opens the drawer and                * pockets the necklace. Tense, he kneels, probes behind            * the table, reaches farther and then -- the letter opener! In the plastic bag. Luther grabs it. \nHe rises, opener in hand, and goes to the far window that has a view of the front of the house. He looks out, grimaces. \n84    EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                    84 \nThe cars are still there. Burton is visible helping Russell in. Collin hands over her purse, closes the door. He and Burton move to the front doors. \n85    INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                        85 \nLuther, going to the rear window. He opens the window slowly and silently. He ties one end of the rope around the leg of a heavy, wooden chest of drawers -- \n-- now he carefully plays the knotted rope out the window. \n86    EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY - TOWNCAR - NIGHT                    86 \nCollin heads to one of the Towncars. In the other Burton and Russell are getting settled in the front. Richmond lies in a stupor, stretched along the rear seat. Russell -- \n-- a moment of relief. She breathes deep.    And as Russell starts to open her purse -- \n87    EXT.

SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                       90 \nLuther -- he doesn't much like this -- but taking hold of the rope, he puts one leg out the window -- only the damn backpack makes it complicated and he's caught for a moment, clumsily trapped with one leg in, one leg out and the backpack wedged against the corner of the window -- \n-- and at that moment, there is a SCREAM. \n91    EXT. SULLIVAN DRIVEWAY/INT.

SULLIVAN MANSION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                   93 \nThe Towncar doors bursting open as Burton and Collin come barrelling out. \n94    EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT                              94 \nLuther, getting his grip on the nylon rope again, starting to go down -- but it's difficult going for him. \n95    EXT.

SULLIVAN GROUNDS - WOODS - NIGHT                      116 \nLuther, running through the woods -- he can hear THEM now, and he knows they're closing on him and he glances back -- \n-- and smashes into a fucking tree!... hard... and it rocks him, drops him to his knees -- \n117   EXT.

He crosses to it, goes to his knees, studies the rug. \nThe rug -- indentations in the expensive carpet. \nBURTON Oh boy... \nBurton and Collin with a crowbar, working at the mirror. \nThe MIRROR; there is a TEAR and a POP and it swings open. \n130   INT.

WHITE HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR                                 147 \nA gorgeous SHOT of a very famous place.    The sun is setting. It all looks magical. \n148   INT. WHITE HOUSE - NORTH PORTICO - NIGHT                     148 \nA room filled with well-dressed men and women. Formal attire. The  rich and the famous. But the only one we recognize is Sandy Lord, deep in conversation with several other men. Now, someone says his name. \nMAN (O.S.) Sandy. (as Sandy turns) Is there anything I can do? \nSANDY LORD Mr. President. \nAnd on those words -- The 44th President of the United States. He has all the natural charm in the world. He is remarkably bright, with a phenomenal memory. He is, also, at this moment, one of the most popular men in American history, three years into a brilliant first term, a shoo-in for re-election when that ritual comes. \nHis name, by the way, is Alan Richmond, and we've seen him before, most recently lying drunk in the back seat of a dark Towncar. \nRICHMOND Take a walk with me. \nHe and Sandy start out of the room. A well-dressed woman moves with them. She is Chief of Staff and her name is GLORIA RUSSELL. \nTwo men in suits follow behind. Burton and Collin are their names and they are the best the Secret Service has to offer. \n149   INT. WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                          149 \nThe group, as they leave the room, come to a wide corridor. \nRICHMOND Tell me about Walter -- how is he? \nSANDY LORD Eighty and alone, Mr. President. \nRICHMOND He understands officially my hands are tied? \nSANDY LORD Mr. President, he's touched at your concern. \n(CONTINUED) \n)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                       45. \n149   CONTINUED:                                                149 \nRICHMOND Any news of the killer? (as Sandy indicates \"no\") Well, why isn't there? Who's in charge of the case? \nSANDY LORD Top man -- eight years homicide work in New York. But I understand how you feel -- it's hard to be patient. \nRICHMOND (terribly upset) No one understands how I feel -- I'm supposed to have all this power but I can't help my oldest friend -- you know and I know that more than any man alive Walter Sullivan put me here -- and now when he most needs me, he must feel abandoned. \nCLOSEUP - RICHMOND                                              * \nOn fire -- \nRICHMOND -- I'll hold a press conference -- and I'll have Walter come -- and I will embrace him before the world. \nSandy.   Listening.    Moved. \nSANDY LORD He'll treasure that, Mr. President. What a generous gesture. Thank you. Thank you. \nAnd he reaches out, shakes Richmond's hand, squeezes Richmond's arm and -- Richmond -- suddenly screaming in pain -- Sandy pulls back, shocked. Richmond looks embarrassed. \nRICHMOND (quick smile) Damn tennis elbow is killing me. \nAnd on that -- \n150   INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT                     150 \nRichmond, immediately after, and he sure isn't smiling now -- he storms toward the Oval Office, Russell, Burton and Collin hurrying to keep up. \n151   INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT                                     151 \nBurton opens the door for them, closes it once they're inside. \nRICHMOND (throws off his jacket, turns on Russell) This thing's worse, Gloria. I need to see a doctor. \nRUSSELL The country would have to be informed, Mr. President. \nRICHMOND What happened to my right to privacy? (rolls up his sleeve, studies his cut) I think she nicked a tendon. \nRUSSELL Burton says it's a flesh wound -- \nRICHMOND (to Burton) -- when did you become such an expert, Bill? -- Ever been wounded? -- \nBURTON (quietly) Yes, sir. Many times. \nThe fireplace.   Richmond goes to it, rubs his arm, stares at the flames. \nRUSSELL Are you serious about that press conference, Alan? \nRICHMOND Of course I am -- Walter's been like a father to me. \nRUSSELL Shall I bring Mrs. Richmond home for it? \nVALERIE (as they study the pictures) You always did disappear good, Luther. \nLUTHER You mean I've got a weak face. Thanks, Val. \nVALERIE You're lucky is all -- some of my customers, they stand out no matter what. \nAn order form book.    Valerie licks a pencil with her tongue. \nVALERIE How many passports you need? \nLUTHER (thinks) Four should cover it. \nVALERIE (writes this down) Now you'll want different looks, and matching international driver's licenses -- I'll throw in some dummy credit cards, seeing it's you. How the rugs I made you holding up? \nLUTHER They're good. Beards and mustaches, too. \nVALERIE (pleased) I try to give value for money. Leaving the country permanent? \nLUTHER It may come to that. \n(CONTINUED) \n)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                          51. \n157   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            157 \nVALERIE Matter where you've been? -- I hate doing those goddam Asian passport stamps. \nLUTHER Europe's fine. Maybe the Caribbean for winters. When can I pick up? \nVALERIE Usually takes some time, but for you, I'll rush it. \nLUTHER Thanks, Val. I've always been able to count on you. \nValerie puts the order book down, studies him. \nLUTHER What? \nVALERIE I don't want to know what you're into, but leaving forever... \nLUTHER Finish it. \nVALERIE I never figured you for a runner -- thirty percent of my runners kill themselves within five years. \nLUTHER (kisses her forehead) Five years doesn't sound so bad to me just now. \nAnd as he heads out -- \n158   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - CRIMINAL LAB - DAY                158 \nSeth and Laura in the good-sized criminal lab.    Loaded with up-to-date equipment. \nSeth has drawn a picture of the crime scene. Words like            * \"Bedroom Door,\" \"Exit Window,\" \"Vault,\" \"Bed,\" \"Victim\" are written neatly to scale. He holds a sheaf of papers. \n(CONTINUED) \n)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                            52. \n158   CONTINUED:                                                     158 \nIt's late afternoon and things are already getting crazed. NOISE in the b.g. throughout. \nSETH See if any of this makes sense. \nSeth mimes opening the \"bedroom door,\" stepping inside, closing it. He makes a click with his tongue. \nSETH I am Christy Sullivan and I walk in and surprise a burglar. \nSeth moves to the \"vault door,\" mimes closing that, makes a grunt. \nLAURA Now you're the burglar coming out of the vault and being surprised. \nSETH Gold star. (aims his finger like a pistol) I draw my gun -- \nLAURA (cutting in) -- then why do you bother to strangle her when you could just shoot? \nSETH That's nothing -- why do I bother to have her strip and then put her clothes back on? \nLAURA There I can help you -- see, before you were a burglar you were a dry cleaner and you still love beautiful clothes. \nSETH And I dress her because? \nLAURA She was a good customer and you didn't want her embarrassed when the police came. \n(CONTINUED)          * \n)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                           53. \n158   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             158   * \nCLOSEUP - SETH \nFrustrated. \nSETH She had a point-21 blood alcohol level. -- she was too drunk to drive.

And why haven't they come forward? \nLAURA Maybe whoever drove her home killed her. \nSETH You saying the burglar drove her home? (pissed) I hate this case. \nAn open door behind them. A TELEPHONE REPAIRMAN appears. Nice looking kid with a dazzling smile. \nTELEPHONE REPAIRMAN Lieutenant? -- sorry to bother you (as Seth turns) I've got your phone working again, shouldn't give you any more trouble. \nSETH Good service, thanks. \nTELEPHONE REPAIRMAN (dazzling smile as he goes) Part of the job. \nSeth and Laura.     Seth's lost his train of thought.   Then -- \nSETH Oh yeah    -- remember that bullet hole in    the wall? Had the lab dig out the    slug -- guess what -- no slug --    why does the burglar take the time    to do that? \nLuther by the bed now, he flashes his light around -- \n-- what the light illuminates: a bed table full of law books. Expected. A phone/answering machine. The mandatory lamp. \nAnd photographs. A proud mother and daughter picture. The daughter is Kate. The mother is a fine-looking woman with a kind face. \n(CONTINUED) \n)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                         66. \n173   CONTINUED:                                                  173 \nHalf a dozen more shots as Kate grew up, the mother grew older.

A white-brick, weather-beaten building, Old Glory fighting the breeze. \nRICHMOND (V.O.) I am having this press conference here because... \nRichmond, speaking on a podium. The press corps stands in front of him, TV crews of all kinds, CNN the most noticeable. \nRICHMOND ... it is here, at this courthouse,                  * that Christine Sullivan's killer will be tried for his crime. \nBurton and Collin, in the b.g., scanning the crowd.

MIDDLETON COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY                        176 \nRichmond at his press conference.   He speaks without notes and he speaks beautifully. \nRICHMOND As you know, I came from an impoverished family in an impoverished town -- but we lived with our doors unlocked. \nRussell watching, listening; she loves hearing him talk. \nRICHMOND (O.S.) We all lock our doors now, but that is not what concerns me... \nBurton and Collin, scanning the crowd. \nRICHMOND (O.S.) ... we are also locking our hearts... that is the sadness, that is the loss. \nRichmond, and suddenly he's like a Southern minister. \nRICHMOND We are locking our hearts to the cries of the weary, we are locking our hearts to the poor and their pain... \nAn old man, standing behind Russell.

I shall fight that battle. \nLuther, staring at the image of Walter Sullivan, who is heartsick and beaten. Luther is simply transfixed -- \n-- Richmond on CNN and now he has turned and is beckoning for Walter Sullivan to join him. \nSullivan for a moment is uncertain. He points to himself -- \"do you mean me?\" Richmond nods, opens his arms out wide. Sullivan gets up, comes forward. \nLuther, as he gets up too, also comes forward, leaving the stool, walking close to the television. \nRichmond and Sullivan, grainy on CNN as Richmond embraces Sullivan, holds him in a loving embrace. \nRICHMOND (V.O.) Dear friend, old friend, we shall fight that battle. \nSullivan, too overcome by the moment, can only nod. \nRICHMOND (V.O.) Who can explain the ways of chance? If we had never met, I would not be President. If Christine had not taken ill, she would be with you in Barbados                        * even now.

Burton is VACUUMING the rug. \nRichmond is visible, still in terrible shape, finishing putting his clothes on in the open master bedroom. \nEveryone wears gloves. \nEverything that is incriminating is gone -- \n(CONTINUED) \n73   CONTINUED:                                                   73 \n-- except the letter opener, which has been put in a clear plastic bag. Collin reaches for it, starts to dump it in along with the sheets and the jewelry. \nRUSSELL I'll take that. \nCOLLIN (surprised) It's got their prints on it. \nRUSSELL (she holds out her hand) Thanks for sharing. \nCollin glances at Burton, shrugs, hands it over. Russell puts it in her handbag, puts the handbag on the bed table when suddenly -- \nRichmond, careening into the room, wide-eyed, crying out -- \nRICHMOND Gloria -- I killed her -- \nRussell, turning, shocked as Richmond bears down -- \n-- she holds out her arms for him, but he is staggering and he collides hard with her, spins against the wall, uses the bed table to try to steady himself. \n74   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  74 \nLuther, stunned, staring. \n75   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                         75 \nWhat he's staring at: the letter opener has spilled from her open purse and fallen behind the bed, out of sight. \nRussell, calm, going to Richmond, starting to lead him from the room -- \nRUSSELL It's all going to be fine, Alan. \nRICHMOND ... But she's dead... \n(CONTINUED) \n75   CONTINUED:                                                   75 \nRUSSELL ... I'll take care of everything just like I always do. (to Burton and Collin) Gentlemen? \nShe gestures to leave. \nBurton and Collin finish up -- Collin grabs the large plastic bag. Burton glances around one final time and backs toward the door, vacuuming carefully. Then -- \nCollin stops dead.   He stares across at the bed table. \n76   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT                                  76 \nLuther, holding his breath. \n77   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - BURTON AND COLLIN - NIGHT 77 \nCOLLIN Shit. \nBURTON What? \nIn reply, Collin dashes back toward the bed table, grabs Russell's purse, snaps it shut, tucks it under one arm and leaves. \nBurton flicks the light out, closes the door. \nThe room is lit by moonlight now. Christy looks beautiful and still. HOLD for a moment. \n78   EXT. MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT                            78 \nIt's open and Russell leads a staggering Richmond outside. Two dark Towncars are parked in the driveway. \nBurton is behind them, turning off all lights. Collin is last, with Russell's purse, the garbage bag. As he follows them outside, he closes the front door firmly -- it makes a loud, solid sound. \n79   INT. SULLIVAN VAULT - LUTHER - NIGHT                         79 \nThe sound is barely audible.

The words pour out. \nSETH Been going nuts with this thing, up all night and I remembered your notion how it might be two burglars, and around dawn I thought, wait, what if it wasn't two burglars but what if it was one guy trying to throw us off by making it look like two? (faster) Called a buddy at the Bureau -- they keep track of this stuff internationally -- he says maybe only a half a dozen guys alive could have pulled off the Sullivan job -- I'm tracing all six -- (beat) -- but Whitney's the only one lives in Washington. \nLaura.   Looking at Seth now.   Starting to get excited, too. \nLAURA Why haven't I ever heard of him? \nSETH Because he hasn't been arrested in thirty years. \nLAURA (indicating mug shot) This his graduation picture from Harvard? \nSETH (waving her off) Ancient history -- he wasn't a jewel thief back then. Just a kid, just part of a gang, a three- time loser.

Now quickly -- \n165   INT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY                              165 \nLuther, inside, peering back out at Seth. And he doesn't seem in as terrific a mood now. He hesitates, keeps on going. \n166   EXT. WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY                                  166 \nSeth.   Outside -- and he knows Luther was watching. \n167   INT.

Luther is deeply engrossed in his labors. \nSeth enters the room, casually taking it all in. He approaches the group, ends up behind Luther who is intent on getting the hands right. \nLUTHER (not looking) Boy, you must be smart. \nSETH (really taken aback) Sorry? \nLUTHER Usually takes a week for you guys to get to me. (turns, smiles) You look just like your picture, Seth. I'm Luther Whitney. \nHe reaches out to shake a surprised Seth's hand -- \n168   INT. MUSEUM - COFFEE SHOP - DAY                               168 \nThey walk in, go to  the food line. There is, throughout, a bantering tone.   Not that it matters, but these two, in a different world,  would like each other -- they're both, in their own ways,  deeply moral men. \nLUTHER So, do you want my confession now or after coffee? \nAs Luther draws some coffee from an urn -- \nSETH (doing the same) Before I send you away for life, I should probably check out your alibi. \n(CONTINUED) \n168   CONTINUED:                                                         168 \nLUTHER Watched the Bullets game    with Red Bransford. Prison buddy     of mine -- runs a bar -- want to    question me about the game? I'm     probably lying. \nThey each give the cashier some money and we see a quiet table in the corner as they head for it. \nSETH You been following the case? \nLUTHER (nods vigorously) I love true crime -- \nSETH -- F.B.I. feels only a few guys could have handled something as hard as the Sullivan job. (touches his notebook) I've got a list here; you're on it. \nLUTHER (nothing shows) I wish it was true. (shakes his head) Your robber actually went in the front door but came out down a rope in the dark in the middle of the night?

How would you --   scratch that -- how would one go   about it? What kind of person do   you think I should be looking for? \nLUTHER (like a shot) Older fella. Like me. \nSETH (now he smiles) Because? \nLUTHER Need patience. The secret is just research, research, research -- from everything I've read. \nSeth. This hasn't gone at all the way he thought -- and he's starting to get fascinated. \nSETH Research for what? \nLUTHER Well, from what I can tell on the tube, it's not a small house. (as Seth nods) There had to be an architect, right? You'd be able to tell which one from public records in the library. And once you know the office, you could break in and find the plans and Xerox them, get them back before morning. \nSETH Not just steal them? \nLUTHER Seth -- breaking in isn't hard -- what's hard is breaking in so no one knows you've been there. Now, after the architect, next you'd want the contractor's office -- and the security company's office. (beat) You know the skill involved breaking the security of a security company? (shakes his head) I wonder how those guys do it? \n(CONTINUED) \n168   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              168 \nSETH Why go to all that trouble? \nLUTHER Papers said he kept the money in a vault, yes? (as Seth nods) Well, I'm guessing there was probably some secret way to open it -- \nSETH (casually) -- clicker -- \nLUTHER (fascinated) -- explain -- \nSETH -- gizmo -- looked like a V.C.R. remote -- \nLUTHER (shaking his head) -- amazing -- (beat) -- must have been a lot of money inside. \nSETH (sipping casually; a pause) Five million. \nAnd on those words -- \nLuther, more than he thought, a lot more -- but of course nothing shows -- instead he breaks out laughing. \nSETH Why's that funny? \nLUTHER The way you said it -- as if you were trying to surprise me. \nSETH (smiles) I was trying to surprise you. \nLUTHER (smiles back) There you go. \n(CONTINUED) \n168   CONTINUED:    (4)                                          168 \nSeth sips his coffee, takes out his notebook, opens it. \nSETH Would the burglar use a disguise? \nLUTHER Seth, you've got to get with the program you expect to catch this guy -- most likely it is a guy, am I right? Some kind of weird loner? \nSETH Maybe like you. \nLUTHER (couldn't agree more) I'm the perfect prototype. (sipping away) But you see any face often enough, you'll start putting things together. That's why these top guys disguise themselves. I read a great article a couple of years back -- damn, I wish I could remember where -- anyway, it was about these makeup experts some of them use -- wigmakers, people like that. \nSETH (flipping a page) Go on about the wigmakers. \nLUTHER (glancing at his watch) I'd love that but I'm late as it is -- got to get my pacemaker checked. (he likes Seth) -- all this excitement, you understand. \nSETH (and he likes Luther) A) You don't have a pacemaker, and B) I'll be back tomorrow. \nLUTHER Tomorrow is promised to no one. \nHOLD ON Luther. \n169   INT.

Moonlight through the windows. \nThe sound of a KEY IN the DOOR. \nLuther enters, takes out a tiny flashlight. We're in one largish room, books all over.

WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY                                   1 \nThe saddest eyes you ever saw. \nWe are looking at an El Greco drawing.       It is a study for one of his paintings. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL -- \nA bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes, the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so brilliantly. \nMost of the students are around 20.        A couple of suburban housewives are there too. \nAnd one older man. \nThis is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a successful company executive. \nAs we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss nothing: He has pilot's eyes. \nWe'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the hero of this piece. As we watch him draw -- \nLuther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff. \nLuther. It's not good enough for him.        He looks at his work a moment, shakes his head. \nGIRL STUDENT Don't give up. \nLUTHER I never do. \nGIRL STUDENT May I? \nShe's indicated his sketchbook.      He nods.   She starts thumbing through. \nThe sketchbook as the pages turn. \nDetail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good.         The hands are better. Very skillful. \n(CONTINUED) \n)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                         2. \n1     CONTINUED:                                                    1 \nThe GIRL hands it back.

RED'S BAR - DAY                                          2 \nA nice working class part of town. Nothing fancy here but there's a pleasant feel. The streets are clean, the houses neat and well tended. \nLuther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S. \n3     INT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                       3 \nLuther walks in. Nothing fancy here. Strictly working class. And relatively empty. An overweight bald man Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED. They are good enough friends not to ask each other questions. \nLUTHER (as they nod to each other) Redhead. \nRED Luther. (as Luther hands him a videotape) Your life would be a whole lot simpler if you could learn to operate a V.C.R. \nLUTHER My only failing. \nAs he turns -- \n4     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                   4 \nA street of   small row houses. Clean, well tended. Luther walks   toward one. Later in the afternoon. He carries half   a dozen small shopping bags, from the market, the   hardware store, the drug store, the cleaners. \n5   EXT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                                    5 \nA terra cotta planter to the right of the front door. Luther shifts his packages, tilts the planter slightly, bends down, pulls out a key, inserts it in the front door. \n6   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                          6 \nas he enters. Neat, tidy. A Cuisinart, a cheese slicer, lots of other nice equipment. As he begins putting food away -- \n7   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - NIGHT                    7 \nEvening now. Table set for one. A single candle. Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it down. \nA gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass. Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner. \nLuther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at them happily. It's Luther. When he was young. \nLuther studies the photo a moment.    Then he turns, looks out the window. \n8   POV SHOT - SLIVER OF MOON                                    8 \nis visible.     Lovely.

Wealth and power. \nWe're in rolling hill country.     The mansion is dark. Totally deserted. Silence. \nNow a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides to a stop. Again, silence... \nHOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away.     There is a small field between the car and the estate.     Now -- \n11   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                11 \nA man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars, begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream -- \n-- it's Luther, and he's been a  professional thief his entire life. He's a three-time   loser, but his last sentence was so long ago and his  skills are now so vast, so refined, that it is unlikely  he will ever get caught again. \n12   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT                        12 \nThe grounds as Luther glides through it.     He wears a backpack. \nThe night is cool. \nHe stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't gorgeous -- it's no-man's land. \nOne final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off, in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground. He makes no sound at all. \n13   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT                     13 \nThick wood with reinforced steel. \nLuther stops by the door, takes off his backpack, opens it. He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO: \n14   INT.

It has two wires protruding from it. It is, we are about to find out, a tiny computer. Luther holds it like a baby. \nCUT TO: \n18   SECURITY DETECTOR                                            18 \nEighteen, seventeen -- \nCUT TO: \n19   LUTHER                                                       19 \nprobing with the wires into the heart of the security panel. \n(CONTINUED) \n19   CONTINUED:                                                 19 \nThe BEEPING is LOUDER still. \nThe security panel.

We all lock our doors now, but that is not what concerns me... \nBurton and Collin, scanning the crowd. \nRICHMOND (O.S.) ... we are also locking our hearts... that is the sadness, that is the loss. \nRichmond, and suddenly he's like a Southern minister. \nRICHMOND We are locking our hearts to the cries of the weary, we are locking our hearts to the poor and their pain... \nAn old man, standing behind Russell.

Luther is simply transfixed -- \n-- Richmond on CNN and now he has turned and is beckoning for Walter Sullivan to join him. \nSullivan for a moment is uncertain. He points to himself -- \"do you mean me?\" Richmond nods, opens his arms out wide. Sullivan gets up, comes forward. \nLuther, as he gets up too, also comes forward, leaving the stool, walking close to the television. \nRichmond and Sullivan, grainy on CNN as Richmond embraces Sullivan, holds him in a loving embrace. \nRICHMOND (V.O.) Dear friend, old friend, we shall fight that battle. \nSullivan, too overcome by the moment, can only nod. \nRICHMOND (V.O.) Who can explain the ways of chance?

GEORGETOWN - STREET - NIGHT                              333 \nThe CAR.    A SCREAMING TURN. \n334   INT. LIMO - NIGHT                                             334 \nLUTHER Shit's coming down tonight, Mr. Sullivan, do you want to be a player or not? (bigger) Do you want to know what happened, or not? I saw. Your call. \nWALTER SULLIVAN (beat) I want to know. \n(CONTINUED) \n334   CONTINUED:                                                    334 \nLUTHER Are you up to hearing about it? -- Do you want to hear how he beat the shit out of her and tried to strangle her -- you have enough left for that? -- \nWALTER SULLIVAN (a nod) -- I could walk through fire -- \nLuther, fast now. \nLUTHER I was in the chair when they came in. (as Sullivan says nothing) They were drunk -- at first he only wanted to bruise her -- she fought back, he went for the kill -- she turned the tables. Then he screamed for help. \nPause. \nWALTER SULLIVAN Who else was in my house? \nLUTHER Secret Service shot her. \nWALTER SULLIVAN (doesn't like it) Nonsense. \nLUTHER Gloria Russell handled the cover up. \nWALTER SULLIVAN Stop this -- \nLUTHER -- don't you want to know who the man was? \nWALTER SULLIVAN (desperate) It was you. \nLUTHER We're too old to bullshit each other, Mr. Sullivan. \n(CONTINUED) \n)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                         120. \n334   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            334 \nWALTER SULLIVAN (big) Who was it then? \nLUTHER (bigger) You know! \nSullivan, shaking his head as Luther roars on. \nLUTHER You fucking well do, don't shake your head at me -- when you're alone at night, when the rage takes you and you think of what you'd do to revenge her, on those nights you put a face to your enemy. \nWALTER SULLIVAN (coming apart) Stop the car -- \nLUTHER -- we're going all the way, Walter -- \nWALTER SULLIVAN -- it's too terrible. \nLUTHER It sure is. \nWalter Sullivan.    A long, shaky moment, then -- \nWALTER SULLIVAN ... I know about Alan's reputation as a philanderer... but... he would never dream of betraying me... I gave him the Presidency. \nLuther and Walter as Luther turns a sharp corner and the WHEELS SCREAM -- \nLUTHER (pressing it) The press conference -- remember? -- he held you in his arms and said if only Christy hadn't gotten sick she would have been with you                     * in Barbados --                                        * (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n)B(   ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96                        121. \n334   CONTINUED:    (3)                                           334 \nLUTHER (CONT'D) (bigger) -- how do you think he knew she was sick? You didn't tell anybody. But he heard it, all right. He heard it from her. That night. And I heard every word -- \nWalter. For a moment, no reaction. Then he sits back hard. The air's out of him. He just breathes quietly. Then -- \nWALTER SULLIVAN That's not real proof. \n", "test3_id": 1898}

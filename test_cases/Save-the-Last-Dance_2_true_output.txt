Sara jumps up, shoves Nikki back.    And the fight is on. 
147   EXT. DRUID HILL - BASKETBALL COURT                            147 
As the dejected Deuces look on, Malakai high-fives Patrick and Snookie. Arvel's moving into their circle when SHOTS RING OUT. Everybody on the court instantly dives to the ground for cover. 
148   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - GYM                                     148 
Sara and Nikki tumble to the gym floor. The surprise is Sara. She matches Nikki blow for blow. It's a punishing fight for both of them and it only ends when the gym teacher separates them. 
149   EXT. DRUID HILL - BASKETBALL COURT                            149 
A car speeds off. Patrick raises up, looks around. Malakai nods. He's okay. Snookie's crawling to the exit, snot-nosed and crying. He's okay. Then they see Arvel. Sprawled on the ground. Covered in blood. He seems lifeless. 
150   INT. MRS. GWYNN'S OFFICE - SARA AND NIKKI - DAY               150 
In adjacent chairs across from Mrs. Gwynn's empty one. 
NIKKI (a hiss, under her breath) It ain't over, bitch. 
SARA Over? I don't even know why it started... bitch. And don't say it's about Patrick because it's not. It's not about him. 
NIKKI No. It's about you. White girls like you. Creepin' up, takin' our men. The whole world ain't enough. You gotta conquer ours too. 
SARA I like him, he likes me. And if you don't like that, screw you. 
Mrs. Gwynn walks in.   Sits down.    Looks reproachfully at them. 
MRS. GWYNN Girls.   I think you need to talk. 
151   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - LIVING AREA/SARA'S ROOM - DAY           151 
Roy's tuning his sax when Sara enters. Her face is a mess. Yet she drifts by, bruised and bent over, as if this were the norm. Roy does a double-take. 
ROY What the hell happened to you? 
SARA I got suspended. Two days. 
She straggles into her room.    Roy follows her to the futon. 
ROY For what? Fighting? (as she nods like "no shit Sherlock") Why were you fighting, Sara? 
SARA (sardonically) I'm not sure. I think it's some kind of black female thing. 
He sis down beside her, instinctively reaches out to touch her face, assess the damage. Sara sharply flinches away. But Roy persists and after a moment, she lets him minister to her. 
152   INT. REYNOLDS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING                   152 
Patrick walks in, Arvel's dried blood stained into his clothes. Chenille's cooking with a sound-asleep Christopher slung over her shoulder. She and Patrick regard each other morosely. 
CHENILLE How's Arvel? 
Patrick slumps down at the kitchen table.     He's barely audible. 
PATRICK Pretty bad. (almost to himself) Can't even play a got-damned game of ball no more. 
Chenille comes up behind him.    Squeezes, pats his shoulder. 
(CONTINUED) 
152   CONTINUED:                                                     152 
CHENILLE You see Sara? She alright? (as he looks up with a question mark) You didn't hear? Nikki jumped off at her in gym. It was fierce... 
Given the day, this is the straw on Patrick's back. He bolts from the table and on his way out nearly bumps heads with Kenny. 
153   INT. ROY'S ROWHOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                          153 
Patrick RINGS the DOORBELL. Sara opens the door slightly, just enough for Patrick to see her face.      It pisses him off. 
PATRICK Shit! 
SARA It's alright.    I'm okay. 
Roy appears in the space behind her, looking out.      Sara can feel his presence. Her eyes implore Patrick. 
SARA Look.  It's not a good time. (gently shutting the door) I'll see you later... I'm okay. 
154   INT. LAUNDROMAT (SOUTHEAST BALTIMORE) - EARLY EVENING          154 
The laundromat is empty but for a few customers and Nikki. She's loading clothes from two large baskets into washers when her brother DIONDRE, 10, races in. He's grinning from ear-to-ear. 
NIKKI Diondre, what your butt doin' here?

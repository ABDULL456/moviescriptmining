CUT TO: 
INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY 
GAGE 
(READING) "--etc." This was the first time you raised any of those concerns, right? 
MARK I'd raised concerns before. 
DIVYA/TYLER Bullshit./Not to us. 
GAGE 
(QUIETING) Fellas. (back to MARK) I'm talking about at the meeting in January to which this letter is referring. 
MARK Yeah. 
GAGE Let me re-phrase this. You sent my clients 32 e-mails. In the first 31, you didn't raise any concerns. 
MARX 
(BEAT) Is that a question? 
GAGE In the 32nd e-mail you raised concerns about the site's functionality. Were you leading them on for six weeks? 
MARK No. 
GAGE Why hadn't you raised any of these-- 
MARK 
(QUIETLY) It's snowing. 
GAGE I'm sorry? 
MARK It just started snowing. 
GAGE Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention? 
MARK No. 
GAGE 
(BEAT) Do you think I deserve it? 
. MARK What. 
GAGE Do you think I deserve your full attention? 
MARK I had to swear an oath before we began the deposition phase and I don't want to get arrested for perjury so I have a legal obligation to say no. 
GAGE Okay. "No" you don't think I deserve your attention. 
MARX I think if your clients want to stand on my shoulders and call themselves tall they have a right to give it a try. But there's no requirement that I enjoy being here listening to people lie. You have part of my attention--the minimum amount needed. 
(MORE) 
MARK (CONT'D) The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook where my employees and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing. Did I adequately answer your condescending question? GAGE just looks casually at MARK. MARK doesn't meet his gaze, or the looks from DIVYA, TYLER and CAMERON...

(BEAT) I've got 12:45. Why don't we.say that's lunch.

EDUARDO puts the letter back on. the desk and looks at MARK... 
EDUARDO 
(PAUSE) Their names were Jenny and Alice- They want to have drinks tonight. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
It's a nice men's room--mahopny stalls--in a nice club in Cambridge. We HEAR the thumping of the house music coming from the club. And then one of the wooden stall doors flies open and EDUARDO is shoved in, followed by JENNY, who did the shoving. She's all over him as she presses him back against the divider. EDUARDO's hands are sliding under JENNY'S white shirt and finding the red bra when they hear a noise. Someone's gone into the next stall. 
EDUARDO 
(WHISPERING) Shit. 
JENNY 
(WHISPERING) I don't care. JENNY keeps him pinned against the divider as she reaches down and unbuckles his belt. 
EDUARDO (quietly--nervous). Oh God. 
JENNY 
(WHISPERING) That's right. And then he hears another noise from the stall next door. A thump against the divider. JENNY's got his fly unzipped. EDUARDO looks down at the space between the stalls. He sees a pair of Adidas flip-flops. Then the sound of moaning, Before EDUARDO has time to say anything, JENNY pulls her shirt open, revealing the red bra, and puts her hand down his pants as we

INT. CLUB/MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
MARK and EDUARDO are standing guard outside the door. They're silent but very happy. A guy comes along to use the men's room. 
EDUARDO Sorry. It'll just be a minute. Some girls are freshening up in there. 
GUY (nodding a little) Sweet. The guy goes off...

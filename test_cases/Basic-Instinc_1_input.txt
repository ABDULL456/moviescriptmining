ANDREWS I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here. 
NICK It's not gonna take long, Sam. 
We see the computer screen.  The screen says LISA HENDERSON DMV LICENSE CHECK We wait and then we see the words 1983 RENEWAL -- ELIZABETH GARDNER, 147 QUEENSTON DRIVE, SALINAS, CAL. 
Nick stares at the screen. 
NICK Bring it up, will you, Sam? 
A beat, and then we see the license itself It is Beth Gardner on the photo.  Nick stares. 
ANDREWS Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it? 
NICK Bring 1976 up. 
A beat, and the license comes up.  We see a young Beth Gardner on the photo.  She has blonde hair. 
Nick stares. 
INT. BETH GARDNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
She walks in.  The apartment is dark. 
NICK You shouldn't leave your door open. 
She is startled. 
BETH (after a beat) I didn't.  Something's wrong with my lock. 
A beat, she looks at him. 
BETH (cold) What do you want, Nick? 
NICK (quietly) Tell me about Catherine. 
She looks at him a long beat, then turns away -- 
BETH She told you, didn't she? 
NICK (after a beat) What did she tell me, Beth? 
BETH (after a long beat) I slept with her once in school. (a beat) I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time. (a beat) She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me. 
She looks at him, sees his look. 
BETH Isn't that what she told you? 
He looks at her a long beat. 
NICK She told me it was you.  You wore the same kind of clothes.  You dyed your hair blonde. 
A long beat as they look at each other. 
BETH I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too. 
NICK (after a beat) Did you know Noah Goldstein? 
BETH I had him in two classes. 
NICK You saw all the reports, Beth! 
Phil had you copied.  You never said anything! 
BETH (after a beat) What do I say -- Hey, listen, guys, I'm not gay, but I did fuck your suspect. (she turns away) I was embarrassed.  It's the only time I've been with a woman. 
She turns to him. 
BETH She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her. 
NICK She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson. 
BETH She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant? (she smiles) Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it. 
Nick looks at her a long beat. 
NICK Why did you change your name? 
BETH I got married. (a beat) He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long. 
He gets up.  He looks at her a long beat. 
BETH Nick -- Do you really think I... that I could kill someone... I never even met Johnny Boz.  What about Nilsen?  What possible motive would I have to kill him?

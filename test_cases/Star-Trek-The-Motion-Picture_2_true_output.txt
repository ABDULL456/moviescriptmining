McCOY Permission to come aboard, sir? 
RAND (elated) Permission granted, sir! 
And McCoy moves toward the door, grumbling: 
McCOY I hear Chapel's an MD now; I need a top nurse, not a doctor who'll argue every diagnosis... And -- 
Even when he's in the corridor his grumbling trails after him. 
McCOY (continuing) ... they've probably redesigned sickbay, too. Engineers love to change things. 
104   FULL ON KIRK                                               104 
as he gazes fondly after the grumbling McCoy, and now turns to the intercom, flips it on: 
KIRK All decks, this is the Captain. Prepare or immediate departure. 
105    INT. ENTERPRISE - MONTAGE  DEPARTURE SCENES                105 Bulkheads closing, feed lines disengaging, main ENGINES HUM into life, crew personnel hurrying to launch stations. SHOTS of cargo deck, down to Engineering Section slamming shut. Drydock area clearing, work lights go out, warning lights go on. 
109   INT. BRIDGE                                                109 
All flight positions manned, ready. 
UHURA Dock control reports ready, sir. 
SULU Helm ready, sir. 
ILIA Orbital departure on plot, sir. 
UHURA Yard command signaling clear, sir. 
KIRK Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu. 
SULU Maneuvering thrusters, sir. 
KIRK Hold station. 
SULU (working controls) Thrusters at station-keeping, sir. 
110   EXT. EARTH ORBIT - ENTERPRISE AND DRYDOCK (S)              110 
The starship within the drydock, but now the maneuver- ing -- thrusters spurt pinpoints of BLUE-LAME. The drydock is ready for the starship's departure -- not a single pod or shuttlecraft in sight. The starship looms majestically within the lacework girders. 
111   OMITTED                                                    111 
112   INT. BRIDGE                                                112 
as Kirk hesitates just an instant, seems to hold his breath. Then: 
KIRK Thrusters ahead, Mister Sulu. Take us out. 
113   EXT. EARTH ORBIT                                           113 
The maneuvering -- thrusters spurt more BLUE FLAME. The Enterprise begins moving, DOMINATING SCREEN as it moves majestically from the drydock. 
THEME MUSIC IN AND UP. 
114    CLOSER ANGLES - ENTERPRISE (S)                             114 emphasizing fine detail reality of both drydock and starship as saucer section emerges. Tiny space- suited human figures watch the departing ship. CAMERA HOLDS ON STARSHIP until completely clear of the orbital dock. 
117A   INT. ENGINEERING SECTION                                  117A 
Here in Engineering Section, the ENGINE THROBBING SLOWLY BUILDS to a THUNDERING SOUND. A glow from the central unit indicates anti-matter intermix underway. The Engineering Section shudders as the great engines draw more and more power. 
SCOTT Intermix set, Bridge, impulse power at your discretion. 
118   INT. BRIDGE - FAVORING KIRK                                118 
as he hesitates just an instant. This is the moment he's awaited, and to him it is equally as sensuous and gratifying as making love -- which, perhaps, he is -- to his mistress: The Enterprise. 
KIRK (after a moment) Impulse power, Mr Sulu. Ahead Warp point-five. 
119   EXT. THE ENTERPRISE (S)                                    119 
The maneuvering jets turn off, the impulse drive glows. The Enterprise begins moving perceptibly faster -- behind her, the drydock diminishing rapidly in size. 
KIRK Departure angle on viewer. 
CHEKOV Departure angle. 
We SEE viewer IMAGE SWITCH to a departing view of lovely bluish, cloud-laced image of Earth as it grows smaller, smaller, dwindling quickly as the starship gathers speed. 
KIRK Viewer ahead. 
And viewer IMAGE SWITCHED to show the star patterned space ahead.

INT./EXT.  APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
The force of the blast HITS them like a tidal wave. The Pilot fights to keep control while looking for a place to set down. 
BELOW 
Huge chunks of debris, glass, furniture, etc. rain down. 
Carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast. 
Groggy, he loosens his grasp on the harness, and jumps clear as the helicopter lands. 
Miranda leaps out of the Apache and runs to him... 
WIDER 
Dust and debris from the explosion hang in the air; helicopters crisscross the scene. 
Everyone turns their eyes skyward, looking for the missile... 
INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - P'YÚNGYANG - (INCLUDE TV) - DAY 
The Premier and the High Command are watching the action at Park LaBrea on CNN Live... 
...As Ambassador Han embraces his family. 
Furious, General Kai gets up and leaves the conference room. 
The others look at the Premier. After a beat, he crosses to a PANEL OF ELECTRONICS and SLAPS a large red button on it... 
EXT.  SKY ABOVE SANTA MONICA - DAY 
The cruise missile EXPLODES, completely obliterating it. 
EXT.  U.S. FIGHTER BOMBERS - SKY OVER SEA OF JAPAN - DAY 
The lead jet cuts away, turning around. The others follow. 
EXT.  PARK LA BREA - DAY 
The Han family crosses to Carson, blackened and bloody, sitting on the curb next to Miranda. Ambassador Han shakes his hand. Mrs. Han and Miranda cry. Joy and Sam grin at him. After a beat, Carson gathers the kids up in his arms. It is a profound catharsis for him... 
EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - P'YÚNGYANG - DAY 
General Kai is getting into his car. He look up as an ARMY OFFICER approaches... and SHOOTS him! The Officer pushes his body into the passenger's seat, gets in, and drives off. 
FADE THRU TO: 
DARKNESS 
and the sound of RUNNING WATER. 
EXT.  PASTORAL SCENE - DAY 
A beautiful ranch house and horse barn, sitting on a meadow beside a brook, overlooking an unspoiled pine forest. 
INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The pastoral scene is a COMMERCIAL on the TV. 
Carson, wrapped in a towel, holds the phone and paces. 
CARSON (into phone) ...I'll call you next week. 
Carson hangs up, and CLICKS off the TV as he leaves the room. The sound of RUNNING WATER continues (OS)... 
EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO - NIGHT 
Miranda, wearing a bathrobe, is WATERING her sickly roses. Carson comes outside. 
MIRANDA Who was that on the phone? 
CARSON The Bureau. (beat) They want me back on the hostage team. 
MIRANDA What did you say? 
CARSON Told 'em I'd sleep on it... 
Miranda smiles, then looks at him, surprised, as he crouches down and helps her turn the soil around the rose bushes. They work in silence. Then, tentatively, she leans over and kisses him. Soon they're in each other's arms, holding tight... 
INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Still entwined, Carson and Miranda stumble in. While kissing: 
MIRANDA Working with you today was certainly... interesting, Inspector. 
CARSON It's my outstanding people skills. 
He slips her out of her robe and they fall onto the bed. It is a tender, romantic moment... 
Until, (OS), a CAR ALARM goes off. Miranda bolts up. 
MIRANDA I hate this fucking town... 
Carson ignores the ALARM -- and Miranda's comment. He pushes her back onto the bed and turns off the bedside lamp.

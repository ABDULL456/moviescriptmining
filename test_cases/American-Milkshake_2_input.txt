JOLIE Wow. 
ARIUS Yeah. This is the future right here. 
JOLIE Why wont it go play or whatever? 
ARIUS Bandwidth. 
JOLIE (CONFUSED) Oh yea. 
Jolie tokes a blunt. 
Arius takes a last puff and puts it out. 
A little cute six year old girl comes out of the bedroom with a sheet of paper and pencil. 
CUTE GIRL Arius. Who was the first president of the United States? 
ARIUS Uh, George Washington. 
She runs back into the bedroom. 
ARIUS So. That's what it's all about. I'm a capital venturist man. Internet porn is the future of sexual healing. Henrietta was just the first of many. It's big business. Dollar bills man. 
Jolie looks on, stoned. Not sure what to make of it all. 
EXT. THE BELTWAY - DAWN 
A six lane highway banks a sharp curve. It's raining lightly. 
On the shoulder of the highway are kids from the Blair Basketball team picking up trash with pokers. They are spread out - a kid every 25 yards or so - and together they extend clear around the curve and out of sight. 
Jolie pokes a Coke can. 
Jolie plucks the can off the end metal nail and realizes he also stabbed the tape liner notes of MC Hammer's "Please Hammer Don't Hurt'em." There is a picture of Hammer on the cover. 
The coach sits in a nearby van with its lights on, parked in the shoulder. He sips hot coffee, watching. 
Jolie looks closely at the tape insert. 
It's a picture of Hammer but someone has scratched out his eyes with a pen. And the poker has put a hole through his face. 
JOLIE (VOICE OVER) I wasn't sure what to make of it all. Why Henrietta's parents never know she was pregant until too late? Or why I never said something myself? It was like none of it really mattered, or was even real at all, until it was too late. 
CLOSE ON: An old PC monitor. A picture slowly emerging from a blurry pixilated square of colors. 
JOLIE (VOICE OVER) After that I used the internet to find a bunch of places that would take Henrietta's baby up for adoption. It wasn't easy, but I found all the information right from Haroon's basement, using Netscape. 
The picture of a couple materializes: hopeful parents and their profile. 
INT. HAROON'S SECOND HOME - DAY 
HAROON This couple looks good. 
JOLIE Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're perfect. All I have to do is convince Henrietta. 
HAROON Are you guys still on good terms? 
JOLIE I don't know. Our sessions are in the kitchen now. 
Adreseis enters. 
ADRESEIS We got the trampoline set-up. Come on. 
They make their way to the back yard. 
EXT. HAROON'S BACKYARD - DAY 
Haroon's brothers have set up a trampoline to dunk on an adjustable rim lowered to 8 ft. 
The younger brothers do an awesome array of dunks. Jolie and Haroon sit on the side. 
JOLIE (BUMMED) It's weird, I don't really care if I make the NBA anymore. 
HAROON Really? What do you care about then? 
JOLIE I don't know.

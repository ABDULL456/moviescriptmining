Clearly he's proud of the work he's done with the pitiful means at his disposal. 
ELI No, sir. I... like what you've done with the place. 
ELDERLY MAN What's your business here? 
ELI No business. We're sorry to have troubled you. If you'll let us down we'll happily be on our way. 
The wife steps forward, she's much warmer, less guarded. 
ELDERLY WOMAN George, look at them! They're not robbers or road agents! One of them's just a girl! 
ELDERLY MAN Seen that before. Oldest trick in the book. 
ELDERLY WOMAN Oh, stop! It's no trick. Let them down! 
The woman glares at him. The husband reluctantly accedes and moves to the concealed trap apparatus. Releases the rope, dropping Eli and Solara to the ground in a heap. 
The old woman helps them to their feet. They shake off the noose from their ankles. 
ELDERLY WOMAN I'm so sorry about my husband. We so rarely get visitors these days, he's suspicious of everybody. (BEAT) I'm Martha and this is my husband George. Would you care for some tea? 
Eli and Solara exchange a look. What the hell is this? 
INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
It's like something out of the world before. The interior is almost perfectly preserved. Chintzy couches. A mahogany table. A TV set in the corner. Lace curtains. Unreal. 
Eli and Solara sit on the couch, feeling self-conscious and looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment. 
George sits across from them on the couch, scowling at them inhospitably. The shotgun resting across his lap. 
Martha emerges from the kitchen, carrying a tray laden with a tea pot and old china cups. Cracked and faded, but intact. She places the tray on the coffee table and sits. 
MARTHA I'm afraid we don't have any cake or biscuits for the tea. They ran out some time ago. 
She lifts the tea port and pours into the cups. But it's not tea, only water. Somewhat murky water. Eli and Solara stare at the cups, unsure. Martha gestures toward them. 
MARTHA Please. 
They raise their cups and take a sip. Martha watches eagerly. It's clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as civilized and elegant as serving "tea" to guests. 
MARTHA How do you like it? 
ELI It's.. uh... 
SOLARA It's very good. 
Martha smiles, delighted. She lifts her own cup to her lips. HER HANDS TREMBLE, the cup rattling against the saucer. 
ELI Have you always lived here? 
MARTHA For almost forty years now. This home is our pride and joy, isn't it, George? 
George just grunts. Not interested in conversation. 
MARTHA We refused to leave, even during the troubles. We said, didn't we George, we said if we're going to die anywhere, we're going to die right here, in our own home. 
ELI I don't understand how you've survived out here this long. 
MARTHA Well, George is something of a handyman, aren't you, dear? He did a lot of work on the place, making it safe. We may be old, but we're resilient. We've had more than a few who've tried to take this place from us. Haven't we, George? 
GEORGE Yes. Yes we have. 
He stands and moves toward the back door. Opens it up and beckons Eli and Solara to come look. 
EXT. HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS 
Eli and Solara stand in the doorway, looking out on the yard. Solara is horrified by what she sees. 
The entire back yard is a GRAVEYARD. Maybe twenty human graves dug shallow into the earth. Some were dug long ago, others look like they're very recent. 
SOLARA Are these... graves? 
MARTHA Of course. It would be uncivilized not to bury them. We're not barbarians. 
GEORGE Plus, it's good for the soil. 
MARTHA Come on back inside. I think I might be able to rustle up some sandwiches. 
George and Martha go back inside, leaving Eli and Solara gazing at the little graveyard. 
ELI We have to get out of here. 
SOLARA They look so sweet... I would never have believed they were killers.

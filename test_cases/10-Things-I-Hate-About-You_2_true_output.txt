Kat and the other students sit at their desks, taking a quiz Patrick's seat is conspicuously empty. 
From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a SONG. Kat looks up, then out the window, HORRIFIED. 
The song grows louder until we realize it's The Partridge Family's "I Think I Love You".  Being sung by Patrick. 
PATRICK (0. S.) "This morning, I woke up with this feeling, I didn't know how to deal with, and so I just decided to myself--" 
The STUDENTS rush to the window. OUTSIDE Patrick stands beneath the window, crooning. 
Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and doing backup vocal s. 
PATRICK "I'd hide it to myself.  And never talk about it.  And didn't I go and shout it when you walked into the room --" 
He makes quite a sarcastic show of it. 
IN THE CLASSROOM 
Mrs. Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her. Kat slowly walks to the window, peeking below. 
OUTSIDE 
Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big finale. 
PATRICK (continuing) " I think I love you I " 
INSIDE 
The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down, mortified, but with a slight smile 
INT. DETENTION HALL - DAY 
Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling over their misfortune. 
MISCREANT Nice song, Verona. 
PATRICK Flog me. 
He makes the appropriate hand gesture 
Mr. Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front, ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine 
KAT (0. S.) Excuse me, Mr. Chapin? 
Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat standing in the doorway.  She gives him a smile and he perks up a little. 
Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He turns fully to face her. 
KAT Sir, I'd like to state for the record that Mr. Verona ' s current incarceration is unnecessary.  I never filed a complaint. 
MR. CHAPIN You didn't have to.  He disrupted a classroom. 
Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the window. 
Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she ' s talking about. 
She motions again, and looks toward the window with an expression that says, "Make a break for it, moron." 
Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick inches out of his seat toward the window. 
The other miscreants watch with glee. 
KAT But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention.  There are far more hideous acts than off-key singing being performed by the student body on a regular basis. 
Patrick is halfway out the window now.  And none too happy about it, considering they're on the second floor. 
He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN.  He starts to turn away from Kat 
MR. CHAPIN You're not gonna change my mind, Kat. Rules stick. 
Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for the tree. 
KAT Wait, Mr. Chapin.  There's something I've always wanted to show you. 
He turns back toward her again, the very second before he would have spotted Patrick. 
Kat glances toward the window.  Patrick's just about to make the jump. 
MR. CHAPIN What? 
KAT These. 
From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump. 
The miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the flash of skin. 
Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern. 
MR. CHAPIN I'm going to let that slide, Katarina. But if I catch you doing that again, you'll be in here with the rest of these guys.

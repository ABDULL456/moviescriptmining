LISA No...! 
JOAN Go ahead: say something to LISA me and I'll say something No! I'm not gonna do to you the way you say that. everything to me -- Why not? 
LISA Because it's dumb! I'm horrible! I get your point! 
JOAN 
(LIKE LISA) "OK, uh, whatever." 
LISA Was that supposed to be an imitation of me? 
JOAN ("") "Um, OK: Withdrawn." 
LISA Well, for someone who's supposed to be a professional actress that's a pretty lame- ass impersonation of someone in your own family. Lisa shakes her head and watches the TV. Pause. 
JOAN Are you coming to my opening night? 
LISA I will if I have to. Pause. 
JOAN You're a little cunt, do you know that? 
LISA Yes. You're a big cunt. 
66 CONTINUED: (3) 66 
JOAN OK. Let's not start talking to each other that way. 
LISA You just called me a cunt, Mom! 
JOAN OK, I'm sorry I said that. LISA But if you're really Why? It's refreshing! 
SAYING -- 
JOAN -- If you're really saying you're not aware that you've been really annoyed with me, or really irritable with me -- and it doesn't matter if_I express it exactly accurately: you know what I'm trying to say --! 
LISA Not really. 
JOAN if you're saying you're completely unaware of that, then I have to say I don't think you're being honest about it. Now maybe I'm doing something really horrible to you without being aware of it, but I have a show opening in two weeks, I'm very nervous about it, I'm seeing a new person and I'm obviously anxious about you and Curtis liking him -- whether you think I should be or not! -- you were involved in a horrible traumatic accident, you're going on this crazy horseback riding trip with your father -- 
LISA Oh my God! 
JOAN -- which sounds like a recipe for disaster to me! And on top of everything else, Lisa, ever since I told you about Ramon you've been treating me like I'm insane! 
LISA Um, I think you're exaggerating slightly. 
JOAN Now what am I supposed to do?! 
LISA 
JUST -- 
JOAN What am I supposed to do?! 
66 CONTINUED: (4) 66 
LISA Just stop whining about everything! It doesn't matter. Norte of that matters at all! You've been in a million plays, you always get freaked out because of what some dumb critic is gonna say about your dumb play, I don't frankly give a shit about Ramon or who you're going out with this week -- 
JOAN I never go out with anyone! LISA Don't talk to me that way! Right! I don't care! I've barely had a date in the last two years! 
LISA (CONT'D) But I don't care about any of this! It doesn't matter! Your boyfriend doesn't matter! Your play doesn't matter, except to you! I don't care about New Mexico, because to tell you the truth I'm probably not even going -- 
JOAN What do you mean? 
LISA -- and you want to know something else, Mom? There are more important problems in 
the world than our relationship! There's a whole city out there full of people who are dying! So who cares if I like your fucking boyfriend? It's so trivial! Why are you bothering me about all this? It doesn't matter!!! 
Pause. The intercom buzzer buzzes. Joan hesitates. 
JOAN Well -- should I have him come up now? Or should I have him wait downstairs...? 
LISA Do whatever you want. I don't care! 
JOAN I don't even know what we're talking about. 
LISA I know you don't. That's the problem. 
JOAN Oh give me a break. 
67 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER. NIGHT. 67 
Ramon and Joan walk toward the Metropolitan Opera House. 
RAMON Everything is all right? 
JOAN Oh, yeah. I'm so excited to be going to the opera! I don't think I've really gone more than one or two times! 
RAMON Well, I wish it wasn't Norma but it's still fun to go. 
- JOAN 
(A JOKE:) What if we just went to see something else instead? 
RAMON You don't want to hear Norma? 
JOAN No -- I don't mean that. I just meant wouldn't it be funny if we just walked into one of the other events, like if we just went to see the Daniel Goldfarb play instead. 
RAMON I think you will enjoy this. 
68 INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA. NIGHT. 68 
Joan and Ramon sit in the audience listening to Norma. Joan leans in toward Ramon and whispers: 
JOAN It's beautiful...! 
RAMON (smiling at her) Shhh. 
69 INT. LISA'S ROOM/PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT. 69 
Lisa dials a phone number off a slip of paper. The line rings. WE CUT BETWEEN THEM. 
PAUL (answering the phone) Yo. 
LISA Hey, Paul. 
Goldenrod Revised 10/23/05 - Page 49 
69 CONTINUED: 69 
PAUL Hey. 
LISA It's Lisa Cohen. 
PAUL Yeah, how's it going? 
LISA OK. (Pause) What have you been up to? 
PAUL Seeing some questionable movies. Not deciding where to go to college... 
LISA Sounds good...(Pause) So...I was just thinking...This is gonna sound really queer, but...by any chance would you want to meet somewhere and like, take away my virginity? 
PAUL Um...all right. 
LISA Really? God, I'm so flattered. 
PAUL To what do I owe this inconceivable honor? 
LISA Actually it's because of my deep passionate feelings for you, Paul.

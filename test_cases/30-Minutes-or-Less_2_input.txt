Rows of cubicles. Speckled with late night STRAGGLERS, bleary eyes, too busy generating detailed lists of places they'd rather be to notice the pizza boy walking along. Will stops before one such work station, looks on for a beat. 
WILL Rio? 
KATE (25) turns from the glow of her computer screen. She has short, messy hair and a sarcastic smile. This is the girl from the picture in Will's apartment. 
KATE That's the plan. Five days, six nights. Culture. Beaches. Acceptable probability of kidnapping. I leave in the morning. 
Kate looks back at her computer, logged onto an Expedia checkout page for a Rio vacation. She moves the mouse pointer from the "proceed" key...closes the window. 
KATE This morning I loaded up an African Safari and a cruise to Alaska. 
WILL Oh, the places you'll go. 
KATE Fuck Expedia. Travel Advisor. Making it seem so easy. 
WILL It is. Just do it. Get away for a while. 
KATE Even if I could afford that...they fired two other paralegals last week. Now's not the time to be putting in for vacation days. 
WILL Ok. Done. I've got my dose of the actual working world. Can we eat? 
Will lays a pizza down on her desk. 
KATE How do you keep sneaking up here past the security guard? 
WILL He's there like half the time. The other half I smile at him. I'm relatively certain he's a homosexual. 
KATE Interesting theory... 
Kate opens the pizza box, grabs a slice. 
KATE Maybe I should set him up with Tom Small. He came out to me today on Facebook. 
WILL That kid beat the hell out of me and Chet in grammar school. Wow. 
KATE Tell me about it. He fingered me at junior prom while they were playing "No Scrubs." 
WILL (WINCES) Really? What a fucking scrub. 
Will grabs a slice. They eat quietly for a beat. 
KATE So, I've got some news... 
WILL I thought the Tom Small stuff was enough of a headline, but go ahead. 
KATE I'm getting back together with Mark. 
Will's delicious pizza suddenly tastes like shit. He does his best to swallow it down. 
WILL But you...you broke up with him...ended the relationship. Finality was had. 
KATE Yeah, but we were talking and - 
WILL Forget it. I don't want to know. 
KATE You sound like Chet. 
WILL Woah, don't compare me to your brother. 
KATE Well, neither one of you seems to care that I don't have a life. Mark's not perfect...but a relationship is better than working late every Friday because I have nowhere else to be. 
WILL Sure. I get it. Here we are. Friday night. Nowhere to be. 
Kate shoves Will, good-naturedly. 
KATE You know what I mean. 
Will shrugs, quietly devastated. Goes back to his pizza. 
INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT 
Most of the PATRONS are fixated on an Orioles game blaring from a large flat-screen TV. 
At a booth in back, Dwayne and Jay are in deep conversation. 
JAY I don't wanna stick my nose into a family matter...but killing your old man? That's pretty messed up...I mean, unless you think it isn't. 
DWAYNE What we have here is a classic "lesser of two evils" debate. You got one evil: me shaving a few years off The Major's shitty life. Then you got the other evil: The Major ruining my entire awesome life by blowing through my inheritance. Maybe I'm biased, but mine sure as shit seems like the lesser.

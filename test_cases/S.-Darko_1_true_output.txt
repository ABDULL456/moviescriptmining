Corey arrives near the intersection where the accident took place. The BLACK CLOUDS overhead have become more vast and oppressive. A cold WIND blows... 
The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK breaches the crest of a hill and comes into view, descending on the intersection. 
Above it the CLOUDS begin to transform and take the shape of an ASTRONOMICAL WORMHOLE that reaches down toward the earth... 
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON 
Chris comes outside and gazes up at the foreboding sky... 
EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON 
As the TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK approaches the intersection, Corey fixates on the JALOPY on the back... 
CLOSE ANGLE: JALOPY 
The CHAINS that hold the junker in place SHAKE and RATTLE... 
EXT. THE ETHER - AFTERNOON - POV INSIDE PORTAL 
We plunge through the PORTAL as it twists through the ether... 
EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON 
The WORMHOLE extends down to the JALOPY. Gracefully. Like an eel moving through water, confidently pursuing it's prey... mouth widening to swallow... 
Corey is riveted. 
As it passes through the intersection, the TRACTOR-TRAILER hits a POTHOLE -- CUT TO:

EXT. RANDY'S CAR/STREET IN FRONT OF DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON 
Sam is walking in front of the department store when Randy's car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the passenger side window. 
COREY What happened to you? 
SAM What happened to me...? Where the hell've you been? 
COREY I crashed at Randy's. We just got food. Want a burger? 
SAM My stomach's fucked up. 
JEFF                               MIKE Awww...                           Poor tummy... 
Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers. 
SAM (CONT'D) We gotta talk about what we're gonna do. 
COREY Don't worry about it so much. 
SAM The motel guy came to the room this MORNING- 
COREY (INTERRUPTING) I don't give a fuck. 
SAM Excuse me? 
COREY I said, I. Don't. Give. A. Fuck... 
She annunciates every word like a true bitch. 
COREY (CONT'D) I'm tired of listening to you whine about everything. 
Giggles from the peanut gallery in the car. 
SAM Corey, you're still drunk. Don't be a fuck-ass. 
JEFF Did she just call her a fuck-ass?

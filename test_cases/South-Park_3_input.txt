DOCTORS and NURSES are pushing Kenny into the operating room ER style. 
Everything is quick and chaotic. Shouts fill the hallway. 
NURSE CBC chem kit STAT!! 
DOCTOR GAUCHE LOAD THAT I.V. WITH 70CCS OF SODIUM PENTOTHAL!! 
INT. OPERATING ROOM 
It's mid-operation. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Siphon the fluid off his brain!! Vacuum! 
Another nurse hands him a sucker tube.  He immediately shoves into Kenny's skull.  It starts to slurp and burble. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Try to untangle his trachea and esophagus! 
NURSE Right! 
While Doctor Gauche wrestles with Kenny's lungs and torso, the nurse reaches into Kenny's mouth and pulls both his windpipe and esophagus out of his mouth, turning them inside out in the process. 
Off to the side, Stan, Cartman and Kyle look on as the doctor and nurses tangle themselves in knots with Kenny's innards. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE No! THAT DOESN'T GO THERE!! 
NURSE Watch his liver!!! 
Kenny's liver POPS out of his torso and slides across the floor. 
ASSISTANT I'll get it!!! 
DOCTOR GAUCHE We have precious little time left people! We're going to lose him soon!! 
Suddenly, there is a long, BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP. 
NURSE Doctor, his heart's stopped! 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Crack him.  Let's get it out of there!!! 
Doctor Gauche lifts Kenny's heart out of his body. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE We need to zap this, quick! 
And runs it to the microwave.  He opens the door. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Who's making a potato? 
DOCTOR 2 My bad, sir.  I missed lunch. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Damn it! I am NOT going to lose this kid!!!!!! 
INT. RECOVERY ROOM - LATER 
Fade up from black.  We're close on Kenny's face.  His little eyes start to open. 
Doctor Gauche leans over him Kenny.  Stan and Kyle are there. 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Kenny.  Kenny, can you hear me? 
Kenny stirs. 
KENNY (Weakly) Mph rmph rm... 
DOCTOR GAUCHE How are you feeling, son? 
KENNY mph.... rmph.... 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Great... Son, I have some bad news.  We accidentally replaced your heart with a baked potato.  You have about seven seconds to live. 
KENNY Mrm?! 
Just then, Kenny's baked potato heart explodes, splattering gore all over the inside of the recovery room and on the outside of Dr. Gauche, Stan and Kyle. 
STAN Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny! 
KYLE You bastards!! 
DOCTOR GAUCHE Damn it!  It never gets any easier! Anybody get the score of that Broncos game? 
INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM 
Kyle's mother is waiting with the rest of the parents. 
The nurse walks up to Kenny's parents with a sad expression. 
NURSE I'm sorry... 
Kenny's mother breaks down. 
KENNY'S MOTHER Oh my God, they killed Kenny! 
KENNY'S DAD You bastards! 
KYLE'S MOTHER I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?! 
STAN'S MOTHER He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny. 
CARTMAN'S MOTHER You bastards. 
KYLE'S MOTHER This is it! The time for action is NOW!! (Singing) Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done! 
Everyone gathers around Kyle's mother. 
STAN'S MOTHER I agree! (Singing) Something must be done! We must take action fast! My child used to say 'please and thank you' Now he says suck my ass! 
CARTMAN'S MOTHER And my boy was the sweetest boy the world had ever known! until those damn Canadians brought that filth into our home! I agree that there is now a battle to be won! We can't just stand here singing! Something must be done! 
KENNY'S MOTHER But what are we going to do against the media machine? It's so big and powerful! 
KYLE'S MOTHER Right! And we can use that same media machine to exploit OUR cause!  We've got to let the whole world know what the Canadians did to your son!

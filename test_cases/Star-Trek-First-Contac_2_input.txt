78   INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY                                    78 
It's filled with patients. The lights and equipment here FLASH ON, as well. Doctors and patients alike react with surprise. 
79   INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY                        79 
Picard enters. They've placed a RESPIRATOR down Cochrane's throat, and attached electrodes to his chest. Beverly has just finished giving him an injection with a hypospray. The heart monitor in the background is now beating regularly. The doctor turns to Picard. 
DOCTOR What did you do to the batteries? 
PICARD Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he? 
BEVERLY He's stable... for now. (with meaning) But it would be better if we could contact... our friends. 
PICARD Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got. 
BEVERLY That'll be interesting. 
A WOMAN'S VOICE: 
RUBY'S VOICE What happened to him? 
Everyone turns. 
80   NEW ANGLE                                                   80 
revealing RUBY SLOANE standing at the front of Cochrane's bed. A striking woman in her mid-to-late thirties -- dark hair, tall, lean, beautiful under normal circumstances but at the moment she's not at her best, it looks like she's just come in from a hard day's work. She's wearing an old lab coat. But the most striking quality of all is the innate intelligence we can see in her eyes. 
She's looking directly at Picard for an answer. Picard realizes he has to say something. He looks into her eyes and there is a moment here -- a brief spark of chemistry that in normal circumstances the Captain just might follow up. But at the moment, he shoves that electric feeling aside and tries to give her an answer. 
PICARD There was some kind of explosion out at the missile silo... 
She looks at him for a moment, her eyes boring into him without expression, as though probing the truthfulness of his statement. 
DOCTOR Ruby, we're going to need a series of cranial X-rays tonight. 
RUBY (nods) I have a fresh set of plates at home. I'll have them here by eight. 
She turns back to Cochrane, moves to his side, gently takes his hand and looks at him with sad affection. 
RUBY (quiet) Take care of him. He's a very special man. 
PICARD Yes, he is. 
She looks up at Picard, and again there's a slight feeling of chemistry in the air. And then she turns and starts to walk out of the room. Picard's combadge BEEPS. Reactions. 
GEORDI'S COM VOICE La Forge to Picard. 
RUBY (stopping) I think there's someone in your pants. 
PICARD Excuse me. I have a... telephone call. 
Picard takes a few steps away, pulls the combadge out of his pants pocket, taps it. Ruby watches him a beat, then walks out of the room. 
PICARD Picard here. 
GEORDI'S COM VOICE Captain, we have a problem. I think you'd better get back here. 
PICARD I'm on my way. Picard out. 
Picard moves to Beverly. 
PICARD (sotto) I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right? 
BEVERLY I'll be fine. (re: Cochrane) He's a different story. 
Beverly begins examining the medical equipment she'll have to work with as Picard exits... 
81   EXT. RESURRECTION CITY STREET - DAY                         81 
A short time later. Picard walking down the main street back toward the gates. People passing him, taking no notice of him...Picard's mind thinking ahead. He happens to glance down a side street, then he stops. 
82   NEW ANGLE                                                   82 
Looking down the side street. Ruby, the mysterious woman from the hospital, is walking along with a camera bag now slung over her shoulder. She stops for a moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt-out old hover car... stares at it...then pulls a home-made FUTURISTIC CAMERA out of her bag and snaps a picture of the car. She continues on her way. Picard is intrigued -- wonders about this woman and what it is she could be taking a picture of. Just then -- 
MAN'S VOICE Catch. 
Picard turns just in time to catch a small, metal canister with a screw-top. 
The man who threw it steps into view. It's LIEUTENANT SCRIMM. Scrimm is the head of the town's militia. While not a physically threatening man, there is a quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility. He's wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always carries a sidearm. Before the war, Scrimm was probably one of the "survivalists" who used to be dismissed as radicals until their predictions of Armageddon came true. At the moment, Scrimm is presenting his friendliest face to Picard. 
SCRIMM (pleasant) Think you'll need that. 
Picard eyes the canister, not sure what to make of it.

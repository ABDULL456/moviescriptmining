{"test1_input": "BOUND \nWritten by \nLarry & Andy Wachowski \nFADE IN: \nInside a closet. \nIt is a large closet with double doors, a crisp line of light cutting down through the center of the darkness. \nAs we begin to descend, voices echo in our head. \nVIOLET (V.O.) I had this image of you, inside of me, like a part of me. \nWe move past a shelf filled with hatboxes and handbags.  It is a woman's closet. \nCORKY (V.O.) You planned this whole thing, didn't you? \nCAESAR (V.O.) Where's the fucking money? \nWe glide over the tightly packed hangers, close enough to feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses to the racks of high heels. \nVIOLET (V.O.) We make our own choices, we pay our own prices. \nCAESAR (V.O.) All part of the business. \nVIOLET (V.O.) All part of the business. \nCORKY (V.O.) What choice? \nWe slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and reach the bottom of the closet, where we find a pair of black Dr. Martens boots that are tied together with a white rope. \nVIOLET (V.O.) I want out. \nWe move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound, lying motionless on the floor of the closet, the rope coiling tightly around her wrists. \nThe crack at the bottom of the door lights her face.  She is gagged and unconscious, a trickle of blood running down her forehead.  Her name is CORKY. \nVIOLET (V.O.) Like a part of me. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  ELEVATOR - DAY \nLeaning against the back of the elevator is Corky, a very butch-looking woman with short hair and a black leather jacket.  She is a lesbian and wants people to know it. \nAs the doors begin to slide shut, a woman yells. \nWOMAN Wait!  Hold the elevator. \nCorky pushes the \"open\" button.  A couple steps into the elevator.  His name is CAESAR, a middle-aged Italian, wearing an expensive suit and sunglasses. \nShe is VIOLET; a piece of sexual candy that would melt in your mouth. \nShe hears it again, a guttural sound. \nCORKY Thanks again for this opportunity, Mr. Bianchinni.  Goodbye. \nShe hangs up the phone and walks toward the wall. \nAs she gets closer, we hear a bed rocking, tapping against the wall. \nThe man's breathing grows more and more labored until finally it swells -- \nDISSOLVING INTO: \nINT.  BATHROOM - MORNING \nThe whining motor of a high-powered drain-rod. \nThe spiral cable whips wildly, spiraling deeper into the tub drain, black goo splattering everywhere. \nThe machine is so loud Corky almost cannot hear someone pounding on the apartment door. \nKilling the motor, she stands and goes to the door. \nBehind the door is Violet, wearing jeans, a white T-shirt and cowboy boots. \nVIOLET Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator -- \nCORKY Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky. \nVIOLET I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee? \nShe is holding two cups of coffee: one black, one with cream. \nCORKY Sure.  Come on in.  Give me a minute. \nViolet steps inside as Corky goes back to the bathroom to wash off the drain dreck. \nVIOLET What happened to Rajeev? \nCorky calls from the bathroom, scrubbing her hands vigorously. \n", "test1_true": "VIOLET Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building. \nCORKY Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back. \nShe wipes her hands on her overalls, returning to the main room. \nVIOLET So this is temporary for you? \nCORKY Pretty much.  One day at a time. \nViolet hands her the cup of black coffee. \nVIOLET I guessed you were straight black. \nCORKY Good guess. \nThey both sip from the piping hot mugs. \nCORKY Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this. \nVIOLET My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor? \nCORKY A favor? \nVIOLET Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools. \nCORKY Oh, I'm sorry -- \nVIOLET No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin. \nCORKY Are they really? \nVIOLET Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ... \nCORKY No, no trouble.  There's other work to do. \nVIOLET You're doing everything yourself? \nCORKY Yeah. \nVIOLET That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic. \nShe looks at Corky's hands cupped around the mug. \nVIOLET Yeah ...  I bet your car is twenty years old. \nCorky smiles. \nCORKY Truck. \nVIOLET Truck.  Of course. \nCORKY '63 Chevy. \nVIOLET I knew it. \nVIOLET SIPS \nVIOLET So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni? \nCORKY I don't, really.  I was referred to him. \nVIOLET Oh, really. \nCorky suddenly feels she has revealed something. \nCORKY Do you know him? \nVIOLET No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian. \nCORKY Caesar is your husband? \nVIOLET Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind. \nSmiling, she says nothing else. \nVIOLET I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime. \nCORKY Thanks. \nVIOLET My pleasure. \nCORKY watches her leave. \nEXT.  THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT \nA dirty bar hidden away on a dark street, its cracked, moon- white sign the only evidence it exists. \nCorky's truck swings into a space in front of a couple of large motorcycles.  She flips her collar and heads for the door. \nINT.  THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT \nThe smell of leather and cigarette smoke fills Corky's nose as she crosses to the bar. \n", "test1_id": 3024, "test2_input": "He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick fold of money and peels several hundreds.  Corky stares at it. \nCAESAR Come on, come on.  if you understand what I'm talking about you're going to take the money.  if you don't, I'm going to have to worry about you. \nCorky takes it.  Caesar smiles. \nCAESAR Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers. \nCORKY I should be going. \nCAESAR What?  How about a drink? \nCORKY My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though. \nCAESAR Another time. \nCORKY Sure. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nClose on the paintbrush, Corky's fingers pushing through and separating the black bristles under the running water. \nWhen the brush is clean, she flicks it dry and resets the edge. \nShe goes to the sink to wash her hands when she stops, noticing her left hand. \nIt is the hand that was between Violet's legs. \nShe is about to smell her finger when she sees herself in the mirror. \nCORKY What are you doing? \nShe drops her hand. \nCORKY What am I doing?  I'm fucking up, that's what I'm doing. \nShe scrubs her hands clean. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nIt is late, the area burnished with amber street light. Corky walks from the building to her truck. \nShe climbs inside and slides the key into the ignition, when suddenly the passenger door opens and -- \nViolet gets in.  Stunned, Corky stares at her. \nVIOLET I had to see you. \nCORKY Look, I don't think this is a good idea. \nVIOLET I wanted to apologize. \nCORKY Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex. \nViolet smiles. \nVIOLET I'm not apologizing for what I did -- \nShe slides across the seat. \nVIOLET I'm apologizing for what I didn't do. \nShe kisses Corky, and if Corky is trying to resist, we can't tell. \nThe windshield is beginning to steam when Violet, panting, breaks the kiss. \nVIOLET Do you have a bed somewhere? \nUnable to speak, Corky reaches over and starts the engine. \nINT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe sex. \nThere is nothing flower-scented or out-of-focus about it. \nIt is sweaty, slippery, body-grinding, bed-squeaking lesbian sex -- \nPungent and potent -- \nAnd when it is over, neither woman can move. \nFinally, Corky's eyes flutter open. \nCORKY I can see again. \nViolet smiles. \nSlowly, Corky gets up and goes to the fridge.  She grabs a beer and presses it to her sweating forebead. \nAfter a moment, she lowers it, gently pressing the cold can elsewhere.  Eyes closed, she lets out a long \"Ahh.\" \nViolet hears the sizzle-pop of the beer as Corky returns to the bed. \nShe holds the beer to Violet's lips and tilts the can, watching Violet's throat as she drinks. \n", "test2_true": "VIOLET ...  I needed that. \nCORKY Tell me about it. \nCorky hands her the beer as Violet sits up a bit. \nCORKY Caesar's Mafia, isn't he? \nVIOLET You have to ask? \nCORKY No. \nVIOLET Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it \"The |Business.\" \nCORKY How did you meet him? \nVIOLET They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it. \nCORKY He's a launderer? \nVIOLET Basically. \nCORKY How long have you been with him? \nVIOLET Almost five years. \nCORKY Five years is a long time. \nVIOLET Yes, it is. \nCorky stares at her beer.  She knows what Violet is thinking. \nCORKY The redistribution of wealth. \nVIOLET What? \nCORKY Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for? \nVIOLET The redistribution of wealth? \nCORKY That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed. \nVIOLET I'm already in your bed. \nCORKY My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught.  She was always more honest than me. \nCorky sips her beer. \nCORKY I started stealing when I was little. We were piss-poor, which is not an excuse, just a fact. \nIt isn't like her to talk about this, especially with someone she just met. \nCORKY The first time I remember so vividly. A bunch of us kids were at Waxman's Drugstore, when Mr. Waxman, who was a mean old prick, always worrying about us robbing him, dropped a roll of quarters. \nWe can almost hear the coins tinkling on the tile floor. \nCORKY I can still hear that sound, those quarters, because right then something clicked inside of me.  Some instinct took over and as everyone, including Waxman, dove down, I reached up and emptied the cash register. \nViolet smiles.  She likes this woman. \nCORKY I gave most of the money to my mom. I told her I found it at the trainyard.  She was so happy she cried, calling me her lucky charm. Fifteen years later, I guess my luck ran out. \nSbe swallows that with beer. \nCORKY Sometimes I tell myself that I didn't have a choice, that stealing was surviving.  Usually I can admit that's bullshit.  I did it because it was a way out.  It was easy and I was good at it, real good. \nShe glances at Violet. \nCORKY I don't usually talk this much.  I guess I have been rehabilitated. \nViolet laughs. \nVIOLET You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to. \nCORKY I guess I wanted to. \nVIOLET I'm glad you did. \nCORKY So am I. \nEXT. PARKING LOT DAY \nCorky gets out of her truck carrying her tools.  Grinning like someone who has been well-laid, she whistles off to work. \nEXT. LOBBY - DAY \nBetween the main doors she sees a man.  His name is SHELLY and he is an overdressed accountant. \nHe is very nervous, talking to someone through the intercom. \nSHELLY I know he's gone.  Please.  I have to talk to you. \nFiddling with her keys, Corky recognizes the voice that answers him. \n", "test2_id": 3025, "test3_input": "At the end of the hall, the elevator \"dings.\" Just as the door opens, Caesar jumps back into his apartment. \nINT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCAESAR Son of a bitch ... \nHis mind a racing blur, he locks the door and runs back to the bedroom. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWith another towel, he gags Corky and drags her into the closet.  In her pocket, he finds the key. \nHe closes the doors, then hangs up the phone. \nGrunting, he hauls Violet up over his shoulder -- \nWhen there is a knock on the door. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCarrying Violet, he hurries to the kitchen, where he throws Corky's gun into the freezer.  Mickey is banging on the door as Caesar heads for the bathroom. \nINT.  BATHROOM \nDropping Violet onto the floor, he reaches behind the curtain and turns on the shower. \nCAESAR Mickey will get in.  I know he will. \nWe hear the water hitting the bodies while Caesar starts tearing off his clothes. \nCAESAR Violet.  I can kill you right now if that's what you want.  If you want to live, then you have to help me. I need you to make Mickey believe that everything is normal. \nHe picks up his gun. \nCAESAR Tell me, do you want to live? \nShe stares hard at him and his gun, then nods. \nCAESAR Good girl. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nWe move toward the door as the lock clicks open. \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nViolet's hands are untied.  She pulls off the gag and the ropes at her feet. \nNaked, Caesar sticks his head under the shower spray, wetting everything. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM \nStill dripping, Caesar walks into the room, a towel wrapped around his waist, another towel in his hand. \nMickey and Lou are standing in the middle of the room. \nCaesar jumps. \nCAESAR Jesus Christ! \nCaesar holds his chest, laying it on a bit thick. \nCAESAR Holy fuck, Mickey!  You scared the shit outta me. \nHe sees they both are holding their guns. \nCAESAR What is this?  what are you two doing, sneaking in here with your peckers in your hands?  You gonna do me, Mick?  Is that it? \nMickey smiles, putting his gun away. \nMICKEY No, Cease.  There was no answer. \nCAESAR I thought I heard someone knocking. \nMICKEY I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower. \nCAESAR Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax. \nMICKEY That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax. \nCAESAR Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou. \nBehind the bar, he sets down the towel be was holding and we see the gun hidden inside it. \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nViolet watches through a sliver of open door, her mind already working. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCaesar is making the drinks. \nMICKEY We was worried about you, Cease. \nCAESAR Me?  Why? \n", "test3_true": "Caesar hands him a drink. \nMICKEY I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here. \nCAESAR Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it? \nMICKEY Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing. \nMickey smiles as he sips his drink. \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nViolet stands and goes to the shower curtain.  She reaches in and turns off the water.  Steadying herself, she pulls back the curtain, exposing the wet, bloody bodies. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMickey is looking at the furniture. \nMICKEY Cease, can I ask you something? \nCAESAR Yeah. \nMICKEY Why'd you move all the furniture around? \nThe knot in Caesar's stomach tightens. \nMICKEY Let me guess.  That was Violet's idea, too. \nHe laughs, and Lou laughs with him. \nCAESAR Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick. \nMICKEY Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they. \nCaesar smiles feebly. \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nViolet has pulled up Johnnie's body and is digging through his coat pockets, searching for something. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nMickey sees the briefcase still on the coffee table. \nMICKEY Is that the money? \nCAESAR Yeah, that's it. \nCaesar puts his hand inside the towel as Mickey walks across the rug. \nMICKEY That fucking Shelly.  I gotta hand it to the guy, but Jesus, if I were him I would have bailed a long time ago.  I mean, how much money does a man need? \nTalking to Lou, be picks up the case and walks back, somehwo moving right between the wet spots. \nMICKEY I remember I was just staring at all this goddamn money, Shelly down on his knees, and the next thing I know, Johnnie just blows his head off. \nHe slaps the case up onto the bar. \nMICKEY What a fucking mess.  Johnnie's laughing his ass off and that's when Caesar lost it and - Boom.  He coldcocked him.  Fucking coldcocks Johnnie Marzzone. \nHe thumbs the latches but the case is still locked. \nMICKEY Hey, Caesar, where's the key? \nCAESAR The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom. \nMICKEY Fuck it, I don't need the key. \nCaesar takes the smallest breath. \nMICKEY I didn't need a key to get in here, did I? \nHe pulls out a lock-pick and starts working the lock.  The muscles in Caesar's forearm bulge as he tightly squeezes his gun. \nHe is slipping toward that same desperate choice.  He is going to attack when -- \nAcross the room, the phone rings. \nEveryone looks at it. \nMICKEY Who the hell could that be? \nThe phone is near the couch.  Caesar doesn't want to let go of the gun. \nThe phone continues to ring. \nMICKEY You gonna answer it? \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nViolet has Johnnie's cellular phone. \nWatching through the cracked door, Violet sees Caesar cross to answer the phone. \n", "test3_id": 3026}

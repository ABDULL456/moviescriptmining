{"train": "BOUND \nWritten by \nLarry & Andy Wachowski \nFADE IN: \nInside a closet. \nIt is a large closet with double doors, a crisp line of light cutting down through the center of the darkness. \nAs we begin to descend, voices echo in our head. \nVIOLET (V.O.) I had this image of you, inside of me, like a part of me. \nWe move past a shelf filled with hatboxes and handbags.  It is a woman's closet. \nCORKY (V.O.) You planned this whole thing, didn't you? \nCAESAR (V.O.) Where's the fucking money? \nWe glide over the tightly packed hangers, close enough to feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses to the racks of high heels. \nVIOLET (V.O.) We make our own choices, we pay our own prices. \nCAESAR (V.O.) All part of the business. \nVIOLET (V.O.) All part of the business. \nCORKY (V.O.) What choice? \nWe slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and reach the bottom of the closet, where we find a pair of black Dr. Martens boots that are tied together with a white rope. \nVIOLET (V.O.) I want out. \nWe move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound, lying motionless on the floor of the closet, the rope coiling tightly around her wrists. \nThe crack at the bottom of the door lights her face.  She is gagged and unconscious, a trickle of blood running down her forehead.  Her name is CORKY. \nVIOLET (V.O.) Like a part of me. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  ELEVATOR - DAY \nLeaning against the back of the elevator is Corky, a very butch-looking woman with short hair and a black leather jacket.  She is a lesbian and wants people to know it. \nAs the doors begin to slide shut, a woman yells. \nWOMAN Wait!  Hold the elevator. \nCorky pushes the \"open\" button.  A couple steps into the elevator.  His name is CAESAR, a middle-aged Italian, wearing an expensive suit and sunglasses. \nShe is VIOLET; a piece of sexual candy that would melt in your mouth. \nShe hears it again, a guttural sound. \nCORKY Thanks again for this opportunity, Mr. Bianchinni.  Goodbye. \nShe hangs up the phone and walks toward the wall. \nAs she gets closer, we hear a bed rocking, tapping against the wall. \nThe man's breathing grows more and more labored until finally it swells -- \nDISSOLVING INTO: \nINT.  BATHROOM - MORNING \nThe whining motor of a high-powered drain-rod. \nThe spiral cable whips wildly, spiraling deeper into the tub drain, black goo splattering everywhere. \nThe machine is so loud Corky almost cannot hear someone pounding on the apartment door. \nKilling the motor, she stands and goes to the door. \nBehind the door is Violet, wearing jeans, a white T-shirt and cowboy boots. \nVIOLET Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator -- \nCORKY Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky. \nVIOLET I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee? \nShe is holding two cups of coffee: one black, one with cream. \nCORKY Sure.  Come on in.  Give me a minute. \nViolet steps inside as Corky goes back to the bathroom to wash off the drain dreck. \nVIOLET What happened to Rajeev? \nCorky calls from the bathroom, scrubbing her hands vigorously. \nBARTENDER Well, well ... \nCorky sits as the fat bartender waddles over. \nBARTENDER Been awhile, Cork. \nCORKY Five years, two months, sixteen days. How you doing, Sue? \nCorky puts a cigarette in her mouth and lights it. \nSUE Like shit.  Now that we're all caught up, how about a drink? \nSue opens the refrigerator and pulls out two Old Styles. \nCORKY Thanks. \nThey click the bottles together and drink. \nSUE You got a job yet? \nCORKY Yeah.  Some plumbing, painting and shit. \nSue laughs. \nSUE I mean a J-O-B.  A real job. \nCORKY Not for me, Sue.  I'm straight and narrow.  I'm just here to get laid or drunk and hopefully both. \nCorky gets off the stool. \nCORKY Thanks for the beer. \nLooking around, she sees a woman alone at one of the back tables.  Through the smoky din, she bears a slight resemblance to Violet. \nThe woman is dressed all in black, including a leather jacket. \nSmiling, Corky slides into the chair beside her.  There is no one smoother. \nCORKY Hi. \nWOMAN Hello. \nCORKY You know ...  that outfit would look great on my bedroom floor. \nThe woman smiles just as someone taps Corky on the shoulder. \nShe turns and is face-to-face with a large bull of a woman in a heavy leather Chicago Police jacket.  She is more wide than fat. \nWOMAN COP Hey, Jesse.  What's happening here? \nCORKY Nothing ...  yet. \nWOMAN COP Who's this? \nHer coat opens as she puts her hands on her hips.  A service revolver is clipped to her belt. \nShe squints at Corky, her head nodding in recognition. \nWOMAN COP Wait, I know you. \nCORKY I don't think so. \nWOMAN COP I didn't know you were out. \nCorky smiles at the woman in black. \nCORKY When you get tired of Cagney and Lacey, come find me. \nShe heads for the exit. \nEXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT \nThe neighborhood would be politely described as \"rough.\" Corky's truck does not stand out parked alone on the littered street. \nINT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nIt is a hole but it is home. \nCorky is lying on her futon staring up at the ceiling, a beer resting on her stomach; a folk singer quietly croons from the radio. \nWe see the ceiling, a circle of light hovering over the small desk lamp.  We move in on the spot, which slowly fills up the screen until there is nothing but the white light. \nSuddenly a wet paint roller loaded with white paint cuts a swath across the ceiling. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY \nCorky is painting the ceiling.  The folk ballad has become an angry Riot Grrrl anthem. \nShe is working hard, the roller sucking back and forth. Sweat covers her face. \nDropping the roller down, she reloads it in the tray when the phone rings.  She stops and answers it. \nCORKY Hello?  Oh, hi, Mr. Bianchinni ... yes, everything is going fine.  I got the tub drain all cleaned out. \nHe reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick fold of money and peels several hundreds.  Corky stares at it. \nCAESAR Come on, come on.  if you understand what I'm talking about you're going to take the money.  if you don't, I'm going to have to worry about you. \nCorky takes it.  Caesar smiles. \nCAESAR Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers. \nCORKY I should be going. \nCAESAR What?  How about a drink? \nCORKY My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though. \nCAESAR Another time. \nCORKY Sure. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nClose on the paintbrush, Corky's fingers pushing through and separating the black bristles under the running water. \nWhen the brush is clean, she flicks it dry and resets the edge. \nShe goes to the sink to wash her hands when she stops, noticing her left hand. \nIt is the hand that was between Violet's legs. \nShe is about to smell her finger when she sees herself in the mirror. \nCORKY What are you doing? \nShe drops her hand. \nCORKY What am I doing?  I'm fucking up, that's what I'm doing. \nShe scrubs her hands clean. \nEXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nIt is late, the area burnished with amber street light. Corky walks from the building to her truck. \nShe climbs inside and slides the key into the ignition, when suddenly the passenger door opens and -- \nViolet gets in.  Stunned, Corky stares at her. \nVIOLET I had to see you. \nCORKY Look, I don't think this is a good idea. \nVIOLET I wanted to apologize. \nCORKY Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex. \nViolet smiles. \nVIOLET I'm not apologizing for what I did -- \nShe slides across the seat. \nVIOLET I'm apologizing for what I didn't do. \nShe kisses Corky, and if Corky is trying to resist, we can't tell. \nThe windshield is beginning to steam when Violet, panting, breaks the kiss. \nVIOLET Do you have a bed somewhere? \nUnable to speak, Corky reaches over and starts the engine. \nINT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe sex. \nThere is nothing flower-scented or out-of-focus about it. \nIt is sweaty, slippery, body-grinding, bed-squeaking lesbian sex -- \nPungent and potent -- \nAnd when it is over, neither woman can move. \nFinally, Corky's eyes flutter open. \nCORKY I can see again. \nViolet smiles. \nSlowly, Corky gets up and goes to the fridge.  She grabs a beer and presses it to her sweating forebead. \nAfter a moment, she lowers it, gently pressing the cold can elsewhere.  Eyes closed, she lets out a long \"Ahh.\" \nViolet hears the sizzle-pop of the beer as Corky returns to the bed. \nShe holds the beer to Violet's lips and tilts the can, watching Violet's throat as she drinks. \nVIOLET (V.O.) What do you want, Shelly? \nShelly glances over his shoulder at Corky, answering in a hushed voice. \nSHELLY \nI have to leave.  Tonight. \nFor a moment the intercom is silent.  Then the door buzzes and Shelly pushes inside.  Corky follows him to the elevator. \nINT.  ELEVATOR - DAY \nCorky glares at Shelly and begins pumping the trigger of her circular saw. \nShelly hides behind his sunglasses, watching the elevator numbers go up.  The doors open and he scurries out. \nINT.  HALL - DAY \nShe watches him enter Caesar's apartment, her smile now completely gone. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY \nIt is later.  Through the wall we listen to the same sound as before of two people making love.  We drop down and find Corky's brush, still wet with paint, abandoned in her tray. \nINT.  BEDROOM - DAY \nHer face glistening with sweat, Violet climaxes, letting the orgasm spread through her like melting butter. \nVIOLET I had this image of you, inside of me ... \nShe flattens her palms against the soft cradle of her pelvis. \nVIOLET Like a part of me ... \nAs she opens her eyes, we see that her lover is Corky.  Violet watches as she gets off the bed and begins to get dressed. \nVIOLET You are so beautiful. \nCorky does not answer as she yanks her pants on.  Violet sits up.  She can feel that something is wrong. \nVIOLET What's wrong? \nCORKY Nothing. \nViolet pulls the sheet around her. \nVIOLET Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee. \nCORKY Shit, here we go. \nVIOLET You didn't want to see me, did you? \nCORKY If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading. \nVIOLET What are you afraid of? \nCORKY I'm not afraid of anything. \nVIOLET I don't understand - ? \nCORKY I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different. \nVIOLET We're not that different, Corky. \nCORKY How can you sit in that bed and say that? \nVIOLET Because it's the truth. \nCORKY Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me? \nVIOLET Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you. \nCORKY Is that what her daddy tells her? \nVIOLET I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder. \nCORKY What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men? \nVIOLET I don't. \nCORKY For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember? \nVIOLET What you heard wasn't sex. \nCORKY What the fuck was it? \nVIOLET All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex. \nCORKY What was it then? \nVIOLET Work. \nThat knocks Corky back. \nVIOLET You made certain choices in your life that you paid for.  You said you made them because you were good at something and it was easy.  Do you think you're the only one that's good at something? \nJOHNNIE You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet! \nCAESAR Here, put this in his mouth. \nCaesar hands a towel to Johnnie, who stuffs it into Shelly's mouth. \nINT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - DAY \nLike Corky, Violet can hear the beating.  She is trying to block it out but cannot. \nStanding at the bar, she runs the blender, grinding ice cubes, trying to drown out the sounds of the bathroom. \nThe bathroom door opens. \nJOHNNIE Prick!  I can go all night!  All night! \nCaesar steps out, shutting the door, masking the sounds behind him.  Violet moves toward him. \nVIOLET Caesar, I'm leaving. \nCAESAR What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels. \nThe door opens again as someone else steps out. \nVIOLET Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here. \nCAESAR Why?  'Cause you know him? \nShe nods. \nCAESAR You women are so fucking sensitive. \nHe takes hold of her. \nCAESAR But I don't want you to go.  I like you here.  You know this isn't easy for me, either. \nHe embraces her.  Over his shoulder she sees MICKEY MALNANO in the hallway, staring at her. \nHe is an older man, hair graying, built like a fireplug. Sinewy mass strains at his Brooks Brothers suit. \nCAESAR Now why don't you go watch some TV or something? \nMICKEY Are you okay, Violet? \nCAESAR Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You know how I feel about that fucking psycho. \nMickey continues to stare at Violet, who looks up at him with her big doe eyes. \nMICKEY Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something? \nCAESAR Sure, Mickey.  Sure. \nHe goes to the kitchen. \nMickey moves closer to Violet, lifting her chin the way a father would do to his little girl. \nMICKEY You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk. \nVIOLET Caesar wants me to stay. \nMICKEY Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay? \nShe smiles. \nVIOLET Thanks, Mickey. \nCaesar returns from the kitchen.  He is holding a pair of tin snips.  Mickey takes them. \nMICKEY Thanks, C.  Now let's end this thing. \nViolet watches them return to the bathroom. \nINT.  BATHROOM - DAY \nMickey takes off his coat and hands it to a large man named LOU.  He slaps Johnnie on the back. \nMICKEY Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay. \nJohnnie hits Shelly once more. \nJOHNNIE Prick. \nJohnnie checks his hair in the mirror, carefully.  Then he begins putting on the rings he had removed for the beating. \nMickey kneels down next to Shelly's ear and motions to Lou, who lifts Shelly's bound arms. \nMICKEY Shelly, I'm going to ask you ten times.  You understand?  Ten times. \nMickey grabs Shelly's pinky finger, putting it between the metal blades. \nMICKEY One.  Where is our money? \nShelly whimpers, red-faced and sobbing.  There is a sick crunch and Shelly howls into his gag as his pinky finger bounces to the floor amid the expensive leather footwear. \nCAESAR Aw ...  Christ. \nVIOLET (V.O.) All night long I listened to that sound. \nINT.  OFFICE - NIGHT \nWe drift across Caesar's desk, past bricks of bound bills, as Caesar folds the paper tape around another stack. \nCORKY (V.O.) What sound? \nHe hits the counter again and we hear the sound, now very loud as hundreds blur by, fluttering beneath us. \nVIOLET (V.O.) The sound of money. \nThe sound rolls into thunder -- \nINT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nThat seems to shake the apartment. \nCORKY And where is it now? \nVIOLET In his office.  I saw it this morning. \nINT.  OFFICE - DAY \nViolet cautiously enters the office with a cup of coffee. \nWorking furiously at the computer, Caesar jumps when he sees her, bloodshot eyes animal-wide. \nHe checks his watch as she sets the coffee in front of him. \nVIOLET I need to go to the store. \nHe nods automatically, back in his work, as she sees the briefcase filled with perfect rows of hundreds. \nVIOLET (V.O.) It's in a case, on his desk. \nCORKY (V.O.) Does the case lock? \nWe see the open top with its silver flip-over locks. \nINT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nViolet is trying to remember. \nVIOLET Yes. \nCORKY Good. \nCorky begins to pace, ordering the information in her head. \nCORKY All right, now, tell me about Johnnie. \nVIOLET Johnnie? \nCORKY It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other. \nVIOLET Like each other?  They hate each other. \nCORKY Why? \nVIOLET It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father. \nCORKY Who is Gino? \nViolet suddenly feels that she has made a mistake. \nVIOLET Gino Marzzone. \nCORKY Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family? \nVIOLET That's his brother. \nCORKY ...  shit. \nCorky covers her mouth. \nCORKY Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money? \nVIOLET Yeah. \nCORKY And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone? \nVIOLET Yeah. \nCORKY Sweet Jesus. \nEyes wide, she paces, pulling at her lip, mumbling. \nSuddenly she freezes as it clicks into place.  She looks at Violet. \nCORKY It's perfect. \nShe's pacing again. \nCORKY Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before? \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT \nCorky sits on the floor of the dark apartment.  She has taken off her boots, which are beside her. \nVIOLET (V.O.) Waiting for what? \nThrough the wall we can hear the shower. \nCORKY (V.O.) For the shower.  That will be our signal. \nCorky opens a thin box filled with needle-thin lock picks. \nShe selects several and slips them into her multi-pierced ears like earrings. \nCORKY (V.O.) When he's done with his shower, you will go to the bar. \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nIn slow motion, Caesar drops the shower plunger and water chokes from the faucet. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nBehind the bar, Violet pulls out the bottle of Glenlivet. \nCORKY (V.O.) You'll get out the Scotch that Gino drinks. \nViolet steps out from the bar, her eyes on the bedroom, when the bottle slips from her hands. \nWe watch it slowly fall -- \nCORKY (V.O.) And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor. \nCORKY (V.O.) An accident. \nVIOLET Shit!  Oh shit! \nCaesar yells from the bathroom. \nCAESAR (V.O.) What happened?! \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHearing Caesar, Corky gets up, moving quietly toward the door. \nCAESAR (V.O.) V!  What the fuck was it?!  Violet? \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCaesar enters, a towel wrapped around him, hair still dripping. \nCAESAR V, what?  You can't hear me? \nViolet looks terribly upset as she begins to clean up. \nVIOLET Caesar, it slipped ...  I was trying to get ready ... \nCaesar realizing what happened. \nCAESAR Oh, fucking Christ ...  You gotta be kidding me! \nHe rushes at her. \nCAESAR Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit! \nVIOLET I'm sorry.  It was an accident. \nShe stands up. \nVIOLET Don't worry, I'll get some more. \nCAESAR There's no time. \nVIOLET Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes. \nShe turns him back toward the bedroom. \nVIOLET I'll clean this up and be back before you're even dressed. \nINT.  HALL - NIGHT \nViolet opens her door, stepping into the hall where Corky is waiting. \nCORKY (V.O.) When you open the door, I'll be there. \nThey pass each other in silence, Violet stepping out as Corky slips in. \nVIOLET (V.O.) What if he sees you? \nCORKY (V.O.) He won't. \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nCaesar is working intensely on his fingernails.  We glide over a set of gleaming metal manicure tools.  We see his hand as he delicately applies a coat of clear polish to a nail. \nThrough the open door, we see Corky moving almost casually across the living room. \nVIOLET You mean they weren't up here? \nCAESAR No!  They're still on their way. \nVIOLET That doesn't make any sense. \nCAESAR Why? \nVIOLET Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs. \nCaesar turns. \nCAESAR What? \nVIOLET I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes. \nCAESAR It couldn't have been. \nVIOLET It was him.  I'm positive. \nCAESAR It's impossible! \nVIOLET Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop. \nShe watches him, her words caving in around him. \nCAESAR But Gino's plane doesn't get in for another half-hour. \nViolet thinks. \nVIOLET Actually, I didn't see Gino in the car. \nHis eyes dart.  His forehead beads with sweat.  He turns toward the office. \nINT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nViolet is staring at Corky's mouth. \nCORKY If Caesar hates Johnnie like you say, then the second he opens the case he'll know, in his gut, that Johnnie just fucked him.  He'll realize that he has no choice.  He can't touch Gino or Johnnie.  There's only one way out. \nShe pauses. \nCORKY He'll have to run. \nVIOLET If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money. \nCORKY You'll be clean and we'll be rich. \nINT.  OFFICE - NIGHT \nCaesar stands over the desk, afraid to open the case. \nINT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nVIOLET Jesus, that's beautiful. \nCORKY Thank you. \nVIOLET If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught? \nCORKY Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart. \nShe looks dead at Violet. \nCORKY I had a partner and she fucked me. \nVIOLET I won't. \nCORKY I think we're going to find out. \nINT.  OFFICE - NIGHT \nThe key turns and the locks pop.  When Caesar sees the newspaper, the whole world begins to spin. \nVIOLET Caesar? \nHis chest collapses onto itself while his hands ball into fists. \nCAESAR No no no no ... \nShe moves around the side of the desk and sees the newspaper. \nVIOLET Oh God ... \nHe slams the case shut, his head hanging down. \nAfter a moment he looks at her, like a little boy about to cry. \nCAESAR ...  I've been set up. \nHe seems ready to scream but can't say anything. \nVIOLET Johnnie? \nThe name is like water hitting hot oil. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCORKY It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does. \nVIOLET (V.O.) What if he doesn't run? \nCORKY That means he probably will kill Johnnie. \nVIOLET (V.O.) Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here! \nCORKY Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nVIOLET okay, all right. \nCORKY (V.O.) We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on. \nViolet hears him. \nVIOLET He's coming ... \nShe hangs up quickly just as Caesar bursts in. \nCAESAR I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money. \nVIOLET The money?  The money's gone. \nCAESAR No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back. \nVIOLET But it could be anywhere. \nCAESAR He didn't have that much time.  He had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's got it with him.  I bet it's in the car. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCorky presses against the wall, trying to hear. \nINT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCaesar is pacing. \nCAESAR He didn't see you, did he? \nVIOLET No. \nCAESAR See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way! \nVIOLET This is insane! \nShe throws open her closet. \nCAESAR What are you doing? \nShe grabs a suitcase from under the bed. \nVIOLET I'm leaving!  This is crazy!  I don't want to be involved.  I don't want anything to do with this shit! \nShe starts yanking the dresses from the closet. \nCAESAR You can't leave. \nVIOLET The hell I can't! \nCAESAR I need you ... \nVIOLET Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out. \nCAESAR Violet, I won't let you leave. \nShe turns and sees that he is holding a gun. \nCAESAR If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me. \nVIOLET Caesar, this is crazy. \nCAESAR Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't. \nNow it is her turn to feel the world spin. \nCAESAR It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out. \nVIOLET You don't, you can't believe that \nCAESAR I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you. \nShe slaps him hard.  He stares at her. \nCAESAR I'm sorry, Violet, but it has to be this way. \nHe moves past her, picks up the dresses and returns them to the closet. \nCAESAR I hope you understand.  I want to trust you, I want to believe you, but I don't have any other choice. \nHe shuts the closet. \nEach man sits on either side of Gino. \nGINO Caesar, look at me.  Johnnie tell me what happened.  Caesar, you gotta do me a favor, a personal favor.  For me, eh?  You gotta start respecting Johnnie the way you respect me.  You understand?  Good. \nCaesar sees Johnnie smiling at him, but when Gino turns, the smile disappears. \nGINO And you, Johnnie.  You gonna stop acting stupid.  You gotta earn this respect that Caesar's gonna give. You understand?  Good.  Done.  Now, where's my money? \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCorky drops a hefty bag, knotted tight, into an open five- gallon bucket of paint. \nAs she picks up a paint stick, we see a second bag beside another bucket. \nShe pushes the first bag down until it disappears, enveloped by the milk-white liquid. \nINT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCaesar puts the briefcase onto the coffee table. \nGino looks up at Caesar, very serious, with his hand on the case. \nGINO We know how this was done, eh? \nCAESAR Yeah, I know. \nHe looks dead at Johnnie. \nGINO It won't happen again, eh? \nCaesar shakes his head. \nGINO Good. \nGino throws down the last of the Scotch. \nGINO Done.  We go now. \nJOHNNIE Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves. \nGino checks his watch, shouting in Italian.  Johnnie shouts back until Gino throws up his hands, refusing to listen. \nGINO Caesar! \nHe gestures to his empty glass, then folds his arms, leaning back.  Caesar gets the bottle. \nJOHNNIE So Caesar, what did it total out at? \nCAESAR Two point one seventy-six. \nJohnnie whistles as Caesar pours Gino another Scotch. \nJOHNNIE Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet? \nGINO Hey, Johnnie ... \nIn Italian tells him to shut up. \nJOHNNIE Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar? \nCAESAR What's that, Johnnie? \nJOHNNIE The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ... \nGINO Johnnie, what did I say? \nJOHNNIE Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it. \nCAESAR Where is this going, Johnnie? \nJOHNNIE Just admit it, Caesar. \nCAESAR Admit what? \nJOHNNIE That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake. \nCaesar sees it so clearly now. \nCAESAR All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case. \nVIOLET Caesar ... \nCAESAR Shut up, Violet!  This is between me and Johnnie. \nHe pushes the case toward him. \nCAESAR You want to do this now, let's do it.  Open the case.  Open the fucking case. \nJohnnie stares at him, feeling that something is very wrong. \nCAESAR That's right, I know.  I fucking know. \nJOHNNIE Know what? \nCAESAR Open the case! \nCAESAR Sit down, Gino! \nGINO No, Caesar, gimme the gun. \nCAESAR Stay away! \nHe backs up as Gino walks straight to him. \nGINO We're family, Caesar. \nCAESAR No! \nGINO Gimme the gun. \nCAESAR I can't.  I can't. \nGINO Give it to me. \nHe reaches up and takes bold of the barrel.  Caesar looks resigned as he shuts his eyes. \nGINO Good man. \nClose on Gino's hand holding the gun barrel as -- \nCaesar fires. \nFrom behind the gun we watch Gino's grip yanked free, time melting away as he falls, blood bubbling from his chest, his eyes wide in disbelief. \nHis body hits the floor and the room erupts. \nRoy dives, drawing his gun as Caesar continues to fire, pumping the trigger. \nViolet drops behind the bar as Jobnnie screams, falling towards his father. \nBlood spurts from Roy as two bullets hit, his gun clattering and sliding across the floor. \nJohnnie lunges at Caesar as Caesar turns and fires, hitting Johnnie everywhere; blood and meat spray and speckle everything around him. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe gun continues to fire as Corky clutches the phone, whispering. \nCORKY This is an emergency! \nINT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCrunched down behind the bar, Violet listens to the only sound, repeating in the unnatural quiet: \nClick.  Click. \nClick. \nRising, she peers over the edge of the bar. \nCaesar is standing in the aftermath.  His gun is still aimed at Johnnie as he pulls the trigger over and over. \nThe bodies are still, blood silently pooling around them. \nBlinking the sweat from his eyes, Caesar sees Violet. \nCAESAR I had to do it, Violet.  You saw it. I had no choice.  It was Johnnie. That lying fuck.  He made me do it. \nHe looks down at Jobnnie, hate rising like bile. \nCAESAR You lying rat-fuck.  You think you can set me up?  Is that what you think?  You stupid fuck. \nKicking the body, be causes a series of sickening wet noises. \nCAESAR I'm a dead man?  I'm a dead man? Guess again, fuck-face.  Who's dead? Who's the dead lying rat-fuck?  Take another guess, take another fucking guess! \nHe stops, panting, unable to catch his breath.  Violet is afraid to even look at him. \nBlood creeps along the edge of the floorboards. \nCaesar tries to clear his head, mopping the sweat from his face.  He bends down and starts searching Johnnie's pockets. \nHe finds his keys. \nVIOLET What are you doing? \nLost in thought, he goes to Gino.  Throwing open the coat, he sees the airplane ticket.  There is a bullet hole in it. \nHe checks the times and then his watch. \nCAESAR ...  maybe three hours. \nVIOLET Caesar, what are you going to do? \nCAESAR What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money. \nVIOLET What? \nCAESAR Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened. \nVIOLET Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone. \nCAESAR Get me a wet towel. \nHis words push her to the bathroom. \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nStuffing a towel into the sink, she turns on the water.  She does not even look at the shower curtain. \nINT.  HALL - NIGHT \nThe elevator opens and the cops step out. \nINT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCaesar grabs the television remote, hits \"on\" and jacks the volume until it is obviously loud. \nViolet returns and he snatches the towel from her. \nINT.  HALL \nAs the two cops walk down the hall, they hear the television. They look at each other, already knowing what happened. \nINT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nLike a maniac, Caesar wipes at any blood still visible until there is a knock on the door.  He grabs Violet by the arm. \nCAESAR If you're thinking about doing something stupid, remember I just killed Gino Marzzone.  You understand what that means? \nShe nods. \nVIOLET They're just cops. \nThere is another knock, much louder. \nViolet goes to the door as Caesar rips off his blood-soaked jacket and shirt. \nHe drops down behind the bar Leaving the chain on, Violet opens the door.  Tbe cops smile. \nCOP #1 See?  We're for real. \nVIOLET I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories. \nCOP #1 You did the right thing. \nCrouching, Caesar wipes vigorously at the blood on his hands and face. \nViolet opens the door. \nCaesar crams the bloody wad under the bar sink. \nJust as the cops enter the living room, Caesar stands, looking comfortable in no shirt, with ice cubes in his hands. \nCAESAR Hey, hey, Chicago's finest. \nHe plunks the ice into a glass and walks from behind the bar \nCAESAR How's it going tonight, fellas? \nCOP #1 Pretty good, sir. \nCaesar turns his head. \nCAESAR Huh?  I'm sorry, I can only hear in this ear. \nTbe cops look at each other again. \nWiping his wet hand on his pants, Caesar shakes hands with each of them. \nCAESAR I'm Caesar and this here is my Violet. \nThey smile at Violet as Caesar puts his arm around her. \nCAESAR Violet said something about gunshots? \nViolet sees the gun wedged in the back of his belt. \nCOP #2 Yes, sir, a neighbor in the building called in. \nCOP #1 I think we know what happened. \nCOP #2 It was probably just the television. \nCAESAR The television? \nHe looks at Violet. \nCAESAR Honey, why didn't you say something? Turn it off. \nViolet walks across the rug and turns off the TV. \nCAESAR Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry. \nCOP #1 It's all right, sir. \nCOP #2 No big deal. \nFrom the main doors, Corky slips out of the building.  Hiding behind a column, she sees Violet and Caesar across the lot. \nCorky moves behind the parked cars, the gun squeezed in her hand. \nViolet edges away, on the verge of running, looking toward the busy street. \nStanding, Caesar pounds on the car. \nCAESAR Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck! \nVIOLET Caesar, someone could see us out here. \nIgnoring her, be tries to think. \nCAESAR Get in. \nStill too far from them to do anytbing, Corky sees Caesar slam the trunk. \nCAESAR Get in!  It's got to be at his house. That's the only other place it could be. \nViolet looks around the lot, looking for some way out. \nCAESAR Violet!  Now! \nCorky can only watch as Violet gets in and the car rips away. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nAlone, Corky stands over the bucket of paint.  She kicks it with her boot-toe. \nCORKY Two million dollars, Cork ...  Two million dollars ... \nShe sighs, wondering how long she can make herself wait. \nEXT.  JOHNNIE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nThe BMW is parked in front. \nINT.JOHNNIE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT \nClose on Caesar, as he rakes his sweaty hair back, his face knotted in torment. \nCAESAR Okay, I come in ... \nHe turns as if he just came in through the front door. \nWe see Johnnie's home has been laid to waste.  The furniture is broken, cushions split open, pictures shattered, holes punched in the drywall -- even the carpeting has been torn up. \nCaesar doesn't look much better. \nCAESAR I've got the money ... \nHuddled in a corner, Violet watches him. \nCAESAR I can't wait to see the look on Caesar's face when he finds out. \nCaesar moves from the front door, trying to get into Johnnie's head. \nCAESAR Now I don't have much time ... \nHe takes a couple of steps into the room. \nCAESAR Got to put it someplace safe ... \nHe looks at a closet.  It's gutted, searched 10 times already. \nCAESAR ...  put it ... \nA couple more uneasy steps and he looks at a large over-turned rolltop desk. \nCAESAR ...  got it ... \nHe starts looking around the room as if he is seeing for the first time that it is destroyed.  He is near the breaking point. \nVIOLET C? \nHis voice cracks.  There is nowhere else to look. \nCAESAR Where did I put it? \nHe explodes.  A terra cotta lamp sails across the room. \nCAESAR Where's my fucking money?!  Fucking cocksuckers!  Where the fuck is it?! \nHe smashes his forehead into the wall, denting the drywall. \nCAESAR Ow. \nHe holds his head, sinking to the ground. \nVIOLET C? \nShe sits next to him, putting a hand lightly on his shoulder. \nVIOLET It's not here, Caesar. \nVIOLET (V.O.) just a little longer and it's ours. \nINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT \nMumbling to himself, Caesar walks out of the kitchen, heading for the bedroom. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nViolet reaches out and touches the wall, as if she were touching Corky. \nVIOLET Corky, I have to tell you something \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCorky turns to the wall. \nCORKY I know, Violet.  I know. \nHer fingers gently touch the wall as we travel up and over, where we see they are actually touching the wall in the exact same place. \nCORKY It's why I'm still here. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSuddenly, Violet hears Caesar. \nCAESAR (V.O.) Violet? \nAs he opens the door, she slams down the phone. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe line cuts off. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nFear and panic paralyze Violet as Caesar drops everything, grabbing for his gun. \nCAESAR Who was that? \nHe levels the gun at her. \nCAESAR Who the fuck was that? \nShe stands and be rushes at her, grabbing her by the throat. \nCAESAR Was that Mickey?  Did you call Mickey? Did you?! \nShe shakes her head and he throws her on the bed.  The gun aimed at her, he picks up the phone and -- \nHits the redial. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nUnsure of what happened, Corky hears the phone ring and answers it on reflex. \nListening, she waits. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCaesar listens, waiting as long as he can. \nCAESAR Mickey?  Is that you? \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCorky hangs up, jumping away from the wall. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCaesar hits the redial again. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nPanicking, Corkydoesn't answer it, but as it rings very loud in the empty apartment, she realizes her mistake. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTurning slowly toward the wall, Caesar hears the phone ringing in the empty apartment. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCorky rips the plug out of the wall. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe line goes dead. \nCAESAR Who is that?  Who is over there?! Tell me! \nShe tries to get away, but he grabs her and slaps her to the ground. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT \nCorky hears Violet scream and that does it.  Gun in hand, she flies at the door. \nCAESAR Shut up, Violet! \nVIOLET He can't kill you -- \nHe aims the gun at Violet. \nCAESAR Violet! \nVIOLET Not until he has the money! \nHe fires and she jumps as the bullet punches through the wall behind her. \nHis point made, he puts the gun back to Corky's head. \nCAESAR Now, where the fuck is my money? \nCORKY Lick me. \nCAESAR Where is it? \nCORKY Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face. \nBlood temperature rising again, Caesar pulls the gun back and slaps her with it. \nCAESAR Stupid cunt! \nVIOLET Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think -- \nCAESAR Don't try to tell me what to do. \nVIOLET You need the money just like we do. \nCAESAR Shut up, Violet. \nVIOLET Let us go and we'll make a deal. \nHe rushes at her, grabbing a fistful of her hair. \nCAESAR Shut the fuck up! \nHe looks at Corky. \nCAESAR What did you do to her?!  This isn't my Violet! \nHe looks at her as if unable to recognize her \nCAESAR What did she do to you? \nVIOLET Everything you couldn't. \nHe shoves her down. \nCAESAR You ungrateful bitch!  You had nothing before I met you.  You were nothing! \nHe stomps around the room. \nCAESAR Who gave you this place?  This apartment? \nHe throws open the closet. \nCAESAR Who gave us all of this?  I did!  I gave you everything!  I gave you this life!  I made you, Violet.  I saved you. \nHe seems to believe what he is saying. \nCAESAR I saved you. \nVIOLET Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment. \nHe doesn't want to hear this. \nVIOLET Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business. \nCAESAR You betrayed me! \nVIOLET You murdered Gino! \nCAESAR I had to.  You made me. \nVIOLET Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you. \nCAESAR Shut up! \nHe slaps her. \nCAESAR Okay, you want business, I'll give you the fucking business. \nHe leans closer. \nCAESAR I'm going to make you beg just like Shelly did.  Just like Shelly! \nHe storms out of the room. \nCorky looks up at Violet. \nVIOLET I'm sorry, Corky ... \nAt the end of the hall, the elevator \"dings.\" Just as the door opens, Caesar jumps back into his apartment. \nINT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCAESAR Son of a bitch ... \nHis mind a racing blur, he locks the door and runs back to the bedroom. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWith another towel, he gags Corky and drags her into the closet.  In her pocket, he finds the key. \nHe closes the doors, then hangs up the phone. \nGrunting, he hauls Violet up over his shoulder -- \nWhen there is a knock on the door. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCarrying Violet, he hurries to the kitchen, where he throws Corky's gun into the freezer.  Mickey is banging on the door as Caesar heads for the bathroom. \nINT.  BATHROOM \nDropping Violet onto the floor, he reaches behind the curtain and turns on the shower. \nCAESAR Mickey will get in.  I know he will. \nWe hear the water hitting the bodies while Caesar starts tearing off his clothes. \nCAESAR Violet.  I can kill you right now if that's what you want.  If you want to live, then you have to help me. I need you to make Mickey believe that everything is normal. \nHe picks up his gun. \nCAESAR Tell me, do you want to live? \nShe stares hard at him and his gun, then nods. \nCAESAR Good girl. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nWe move toward the door as the lock clicks open. \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nViolet's hands are untied.  She pulls off the gag and the ropes at her feet. \nNaked, Caesar sticks his head under the shower spray, wetting everything. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM \nStill dripping, Caesar walks into the room, a towel wrapped around his waist, another towel in his hand. \nMickey and Lou are standing in the middle of the room. \nCaesar jumps. \nCAESAR Jesus Christ! \nCaesar holds his chest, laying it on a bit thick. \nCAESAR Holy fuck, Mickey!  You scared the shit outta me. \nHe sees they both are holding their guns. \nCAESAR What is this?  what are you two doing, sneaking in here with your peckers in your hands?  You gonna do me, Mick?  Is that it? \nMickey smiles, putting his gun away. \nMICKEY No, Cease.  There was no answer. \nCAESAR I thought I heard someone knocking. \nMICKEY I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower. \nCAESAR Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax. \nMICKEY That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax. \nCAESAR Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou. \nBehind the bar, he sets down the towel be was holding and we see the gun hidden inside it. \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nViolet watches through a sliver of open door, her mind already working. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCaesar is making the drinks. \nMICKEY We was worried about you, Cease. \nCAESAR Me?  Why? \nCAESAR Violet! \nHe aims the gun as she hurls her self into the emergency door. \nCAESAR Fuck! \nINT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT \nShe flies, hands on the rail, spiraling down each flight as he charges after her. \nCAESAR Goddammit, Violet!  Stop!  Now! \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nStraining, Corky's fingers curl around the handle of the clippers. \nINT.  LOBBY - NIGHT \nViolet smashes through the door, but instead of turning to the main doors, she runs straight for the elevators. \nShe pounds the button and waits. \nVIOLET Come on.  Come on, please. \nShe hears Caesar coming just as the elevator opens. \nCaesar crashes out of the stair door, running toward the exit.  When he doesn't see Violet, he turns to the sound of the elevator -- \nAnd catches a glimpse of her as the doors close. \nCAESAR Oh, you bitch.  You fucking bitch. \nTaking a really deep breath, he throws open the door to the stairs. \nINT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nViolet takes Johnnie's cellular phone from the robe pocket and dials a number. \nMickey answers on the car phone. \nVIOLET Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey! \nMICKEY (V.O.) Violet? \nWhispering, she acts terrified. \nVIOLET He made me help him, Mickey, God, I was so afraid.  It was Caesar, all Caesar.  You have to help me.  He's coming - Oh God! \nShe hangs up, eyes blazing. \nINT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT \nSweat pouring off him, Caesar climbs the stairs. \nINT.  HALL - NIGHT \nThe elevator opens, Violet bolts out.  She runs down the hall, past the empty apartment, back to her door. \nVIOLET Corky? \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nShe rushes to the bedroom, where she finds the coils of cut rope. \nVIOLET Corky! \nShe looks at the wall separating the apartment. \nINT.  HALL - NIGHT \nCaesar half-falls out of the stair door, drenched with sweat. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT \nGun ready, Caesar throws open the door. \nSpread out like a pond of milk is the spilled paint, but -- \nThe money is gone. \nLeading away from the white pool are boot prints and the drip trail of the plastic bag. \nThe tracks lead to the bathroom. \nCaesar kicks open the bathroom door and finds the bag of money next to Corky's empty boots. \nOver his shoulder we see Corky already swinging a massive pipe wrench. \nAt the last second he is able to duck, falling to the ground as -- \nThe doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch. \nBefore he can recover and shoot, she brings the wrench down on his arm. \nHe screams as the gun hits the floor. \n", "test1_input": "VIOLET You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky? \nCORKY No. \nShe looks at Violet, then takes another long pull on the bottle. \nVIOLET Thirsty, maybe. \nViolet smiles, her eyes again talking for her. \nCORKY Curious, maybe. \nVIOLET Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now. \nViolet notices the tattoo on Corky's arm. \nVIOLET That's a great tattoo. \nShe reaches over and touches it. \nVIOLET Beautiful labrys. \nCorky is a bit suprised that she knows what it is.  She nods, rubbing it as if trying to hide it. \nVIOLET Are you surprised that I know what it is? \nCORKY Maybe. \nVIOLET I have a tattoo, would you like to see it? \nShe moves closer, sliding over the leather cushions as she opens the front of her dress. \nVIOLET A woman in upstate New York did it for me. \nShe is not wearing a bra. \nVIOLET Here.  Do you like it? \nSet against the soft white skin of her breast is a bright green-stemmed violet. \nVIOLET It took her all day to do it.  She promised me it wouldn't hurt, but it was sore for a long time after.  I couldn't even touch it. \nCorky looks up from Violet's breast to her dark eyes. \nVIOLET But now I love the way it feels. \nShe runs her fingers softly over the slightly scarred skin. \nVIOLET Here, touch it. \nCorky feels the blood pounding in her ears as Violet takes her hand and places it on her breast. \nCORKY What are you doing? \nViolet looks at her. \nVIOLET Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you. \nCORKY Why? \nVIOLET Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator. \nCorky watches her, trying to figure her out even as her thumb presses into Violet's nipple. \nInhaling sharply, Violet closes her eyes; she can feel Corky staring at her. \nVIOLET You don't believe me.  But I can prove it to you. \nShe takes Corky's wrist and begins pulling her hand down her body. \nVIOLET You can't believe me because of what you see ... \nShe forces Corky's hand between her legs, up under her dress. \nVIOLET But you can believe what you feel. \nViolet opens her eyes, a wanton smile on her lips. \nVIOLET You see ...  I've been thinking about you all day. \nCorky's forearm flexes and Violet moans. \nWith both hands, Violet takes hold of Corky's forearm. \nCORKY You planned this whole thing? \nViolet's head swims; she is unable to breathe. \nCORKY You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you? \nVIOLET If I say yes, will you take your hand away? \nCORKY No. \nVIOLET ...  yes. \n", "test1_true": "Violet shivers, her thighs rubbing, her hips thrusting against Corky's hand. \nVIOLET Please, Corky ...  please ... \nHer eyes barely open. \nVIOLET ...  kiss me. \nIn a single motion, Corky takes hold of the back of her neck and covers Violet's open mouth with her own. \nWith her hand still stuffed between Violet's legs, Corky lays her back onto the couch as the kiss becomes more -- \nMore desperate, more hungry until -- \nWe hear the front door unlock and open. \nCAESAR Violet? \nViolet's eyes pop open and she pushes Corky back. \nCAESAR Violet, you home? \nThey scramble to compose themselves. \nVIOLET Yeah.  In here, C. \nHe comes around the corner and in the dim light sees the two figures sitting close on the couch. \nCAESAR What's this? \nHe mistakes Corky for a man. \nCAESAR What the fuck is this? \nViolet stands as Caesar barrels toward the couch. \nVIOLET I didn't expect -- \nCAESAR What the fuck is going on? \nCorky stands and turns, Caesar suddenly realizing that she is a woman. \nCAESAR Oh, shit ... \nVIOLET Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar. \nCAESAR I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here. \nHe reaches to the wall for the lights. \nVIOLET She is working for Bianchinni. \nCaesar extends his hand. \nCAESAR Oh, right, right.  Don mentioned that to me.  Hi, welcome to the family. \nCorky shakes his hand. \nCAESAR You're helping Rajeev? \nCORKY No.  Rajeev's in India. \nVIOLET She's doing the work herself. \nCAESAR No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really. \nCORKY That's what Violet said. \nHe looks at her as if he knows something. \nCAESAR So, you just got out? \nVIOLET Jesus, Caesar! \nCAESAR What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself? \nCorky shakes her head. \nCAESAR Thirteen fucking years.  See, there ain't no secrets here. \nCorky doesn't like this man. \nCAESAR How many'd you do? \nCORKY Five. \nHe whistles. \nCAESAR Not bad.  What for? \nVIOLET That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar. \nCAESAR You're right.  You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.

CORKY'S TRUCK - DAY \nThrough the back window of the truck, Violet and Corky are silhouettes against the street light. \nVIOLET Caesar is going to get the money and bring -- \nCORKY How much money? \nVIOLET Shelly said it was over two million dollars. \nCorky quietly swallows that pill.  It begins to rain. \nVIOLET Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it. \nCORKY Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob. \nViolet nods. \nCORKY These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right. \nVIOLET That's why I need your help.  You said you were good. \nCORKY I am, but ... \nShe knows Violet is challenging her. \nCORKY All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying. \nVIOLET You think I'm lying? \nCORKY I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment. \nViolet stares, her face poker-blank. \nCORKY All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me. \nVIOLET Is that what you think? \nCORKY I'm just making a point.  You have no idea what you're asking.  How much trust two people need to do something like this. \nShe moves closer to Violet, the sound of the rain beating against the metal cab. \nCORKY For me, stealing is a lot like sex. Two people that want the same thing sit in a room and they talk, they start to plan and it's like flirting, a kind of foreplay, because the more they talk about it, the wetter they get. \nShe stops. \nCORKY The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself. \nVIOLET Do you think you know me like that? \nCORKY I think ... \nThey are close enough to kiss. \nCORKY We're going to find out. \nCorky pulls back. \nCORKY But first, I want to see this money. \nINT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nViolet springs from the couch as the front door crashes open, Caesar charging in.  He is doubled over, clutching something to his stomach. \nHe rushes to the kitchen, dumping a bloody bundle into the double sink.  There is blood everywhere, smeared up and down Caesar's front. \nVIOLET Oh my God ... \nViolet takes a step toward him, unsure of what has happened. \nCAESAR Don't worry.  It ain't mine. \nHe pulls a bottle of whiskey and a glass from the cupboard. \nVIOLET Caesar, what happened? \nCAESAR It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable! \nHe pours himeslf a shot, belting it back. \nCAESAR Goddammit, look at this shirt!  It's ruined! \nHe begins unbuttoning the bloody shirt. \nCAESAR It started when Shelly took us to the money.  I tell you, Mickey Malnato knows his shit, he does.  Shelly takes us right there. \nHe throws down another shot. \nCAESAR So Shelly's down on his knees and he's pulling out this bag of money from a safe in the floor and I'm staring at it like \"holy fuck!\" I mean, look at it -- \nHe tears open the bloody bag, wet money bricks spilling out. \nCAESAR And all I can think is how the fuck did he do this when - Bang!  Johnnie caps him.  Blood sprays everywhere, all over the money.  We've no idea if this is even all of it. \n", "test2_true": "CAESAR And right then I go through the roof and - Boom!  I belt the dumb fuck as hard as I can.  I didn't care whose son he was, I just wanted to hit him again.  Knock some sense into that dumb son of a bitch. \nHe looks at the pile of bloody money. \nCAESAR Just look at this mess I got to deal with. \nVIOLET What are you going to do with it? \nCAESAR I told them to run it through the cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up. \nSearching through a sink cabinet, he can't find what he needs. \nCAESAR Where the hell's the laundry detergent? \nVIOLET Ummm ...  in the linen closet. \nCaesar walks down the ball to the bathroom.

CLOSET - NIGHT \nCorky's hands twitch, and then flex against the ropes that bind them. \nA reflex echoes through her body, muscles spasm and limbs jerk against their bonds. \nAs if in a dream, she struggles, trying to get free, fighting toward the edge of consciousness until -- \nShe seems to succumb, slipping back into stillness. \nWe move toward her face, her closed eyes as we again hear the voices in her head. \nVIOLET (V.O.) You're having second thoughts. \nINT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nViolet is on the bed, Corky at the window. \nCORKY ...  no. \nShe turns to Violet. \nCORKY You said he washed the money? \nVIOLET Yeah. \nCORKY Then what?  Exactly. \nVIOLET He hung it up. \nCORKY What? \nVIOLET To let it dry. \nShe begins to focus on the memory. \nVIOLET It was unreal ... \nMoving in on her face. \nMATCH CUT TO: \nBenjamin Franklin's face on a hundred-dollar bill. \nINT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nFranklin's face rotates as we pull back, seeing rows of bills carefully paper-clipped to lines of string. \nVIOLET (V.O.) Hundreds, paper-clipped everywhere like leaves. \nEyes filled with green, Violet turns inside the laundry lines of money until she sees Caesar. \nWearing his undershirt, he is across the room standing at the ironing board, ironing every single bill. \nHe seems to have one eye on her, one eye on his work. \nVIOLET (V.O.) Then one by one, he ironed all of it. \nHe sprays starch across several bills and presses the steaming iron to them. \nCORKY (V.O.) Did he sleep? \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nViolet is in bed, unable to sleep, listening to the machine- shuffle of Caesar's bill counter. \nVIOLET (V.O.) No.  But neither did I. \nWe move past her, floating toward the wall. \n", "test3_input": "CESAR (V.O.) Hello? \nVIOLET Hello, Caesar.  This is Gino. \nCaesar looks toward the bathroom. \nCAESAR (V.O.) What? \nVIOLET You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCaesar's eyes light up. \nCAESAR Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino! \nVIOLET (V.O.) Good boy. \nMickey jumps up. \nCAESAR It's Gino!  It's Gino! \nMICKEY Where in the hell is he? \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nVIOLET We were in a car accident -- \nCAESAR (V.O.) They were in a car accident. \nVIOLET But everybody is all right. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCAESAR They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit. \nVIOLET (V.O.) Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ... \nMICKEY Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks. \nCAESAR Ssh!  I can't hear Gino! \nVIOLET (V.O.) We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey. \nCAESAR I'm listening. \nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT \nViolet has her robe over her dress, wrapping her hair in a towel, making sure the bruise on her forehead is hidden. \nVIOLET I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand. \nCAESAR (V.O.) Yes, I understand. \nVIOLET Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out. \nCAESAR (V.O.) Sure, Gino, sure. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nOut of the corner of his eye, he watches Violet come out of the bathroom. \nCAESAR St.  Mary's off the Kennedy, sure. Okay, Gino. \nMickey sees Violet. \nVIOLET Mickey?  What are you doing here? \nMICKEY Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident. \nVIOLET Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt? \nMICKEY I think everything is okay. \nCaesar hangs up. \nCAESAR They're at St.  Mary's in the waiting room. \nMick is already on the way. \nMICKEY I can't fit them all in my car so give me your keys.  You drive my car, Lou. \nCaesar sees Violet walking toward the kitchen. \nCAESAR Sure, Mickey, sure.  Violet! \nShe stops, looking straight at the freezer. \nCAESAR Go grab my car keys from my pants in the bathroom. \nShe turns to him. \nCAESAR Please, help us out, Mickey wants to get going. \nShe turns to the bathroom. \n", "test3_true": "He grabs the briefcase. \nMICKEY You got the key? \nCAESAR Oh yeah.  Violet! \nINT.  CLOSET - NIGHT \nWhere Corky remains bound, still unconscious.  We hear the name echo in her head. \nCAESAR (V.O.) Violet! \nSuddenly, her eyes blink open. \nCAESAR (V.O.) Violet! \nHer eyes blink again as she tries to focus. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nViolet hands Mickey the keys for the car and the case. \nMICKEY Thanks, V. \nHe kisses her on the cheek. \nCAESAR Call me as soon as you get him. \nMICKEY Leave your phone on the hook. \nMickey and Lou leave.  Violet is staring at Caesar, standing near the door. \nIn his right hand he is holding the other towel.  He smiles. \nCAESAR Now that's teamwork. \nVIOLET I should have let him kill you. \nCAESAR You know he would have done you, too. \nVIOLET I knew I couldn't trust you. \nHe drops the towel, raising the gun. \nCAESAR I said I'd let you live and I will. \nHe smiles again. \nCAESAR Maybe. \nINT.  CLOSET - NIGHT \nCorky is wide awake, thrashing-mad, biting her gag, struggling to get free. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCaesar pulls his pants on. \nCAESAR Time to find out if the dyke was stupid enough to lie. \nCaesar drags Violet througb the front door. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe closet doors burst open as Corky fights her way out. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nCaesar sees the buckets of paint. \nHe rips the lid from the nearest and kicks it over.  Paint spills out across the floor. \nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT \nSuddenly Corky stops; something has caught her eye.  We drop down, focusing on what she is staring at -- \nThe clippers. \nINT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nHe kicks over the second bucket and the bag tumbles out with the rushing flow of paint. \nCAESAR Yes! \nHe turns to Violet, who is already running out the door. \nCAESAR No! \nINT.  HALL - NIGHT \nViolet turns down the hall, bare feet beating against the floor. \nCaesar slices out of the room behind her. \n"}

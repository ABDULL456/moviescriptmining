CHRIS No, sir. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE Was that your ass talking then? 
THE BELL RINGS. Chris jerks up, worried it was Biggles but-- an ATHLETIC CANDIDATE staggers off. 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE That's a quitter. If he quits here, he'll quit in battle. When shit gets hairy he can't step up. You get shot, he can't pull you out. We're gonna weed out the quitters and see if we can find a warrior or two. 
Chris and Biggles share a look, a vow, as-- 
INSTRUCTOR ROLLE Wave goodbye to the sun, boys...

24   EXT. BEACH - "SNAKE PIT" - NIGHT                            24 
A bonfire crackles atop a sand dune. CANDIDATES crouch in a pit they dug, hugging oars, shivering with hypothermia. CHRIS stands over the ditch, trying to make INSTRUCTORS laugh to earn a place by the fire beside BIGGLES. 
CHRIS --and when I told her the condom broke she started crying and begging me to do something. And I'm a virgin, I don't know what to do, but I'd heard if you pour Coke up there you won't get pregnant-- (guys start laughing) So we went to 7-11, got a liter of Coke and drove back into the woods. She took her panties off and did a handstand against a tree but when I start pouring, she starts screaming, "it stings, it stings" but when I'd stop, she'd scream "no don't stop" and it's fizzing out and-- 
INSTRUCTORS in stitches. Fire flickering off Chris' face. 
25   EXT. "MUD FLATS" - DAY                                      25 
Fog shrouds CANDIDATES COVERED IN MUD, seated belly-to- back, chattering and quaking, hypothermic. 
"INSTRUCTOR TONY"(34), a salty cholo, walks their line. 
INSTRUCTOR "TONY" You really from Connecticut, Dauber? I never met a hick from Hartford. 
"DAUBER" is 6'4" and 240 with a flop of yellow hair like the character from Coach. A sleepy Connecticut cowboy. 
DAUBER Country is countrywide, sir. 
INSTRUCTOR "TONY" I don't think he likes black dudes, "D". 
"D" is African American, from Indiana, stoic and stacked. He has a rhythmic grumble and a meat-eater's glare. 
"D" That's alright, sir. I'm not black. 
INSTRUCTOR "TONY" No? 
"D" No, I'm new black. We run slow, jump low, swim good and shop at Gap. We make white folk proud then hose their ladies. 
"BIGGLES" still giggles, but he's looking fit as they chip away everything that isn't a Navy Seal. 
INSTRUCTOR "TONY" You hungry Biggles? I'd bet you'd eat the ass out of a low-flying duck. 
BIGGLES Hooyah. I'd toss that critter shitter on a baguette and get my eat on. 
"SQUIRREL" is a San Clemente surfer kid, just tall enough to ride roller-coaster, with a jutty jaw. 
INSTRUCTOR "TONY" (screams in his face) Squirrel! Where'd you hide your nuts? 
SQUIRREL Nuts crawled up inside. The little shits are gone for good. 
"CHRIS" sits up front, covered in mud. His eyes burn steely blue, full of resolve. He's found himself here. 
INSTRUCTOR "TONY" How about you old man? How you feeling? 
CHRIS KYLE Dangerous, sir. Feeling dangerous. 
The boys send up a spirited "HOOYAH" and-- TONY looks them over with some small measure of approval. 
26   EXT. BEACH - SUNSET                                         26 
The INSTRUCTOR CADRE watches 32 CANDIDATES SWARM each other, howling and dog-piling at the end of hell-week.

29   INT. MULONEY'S BAR - NIGHT                                  29 
A crowd watches the boys toss darts at a bulls-eye drawn on DAUBER'S naked back. At the bar, BIGGLES and CHRIS-- 
CHRIS I'm gonna try and get into sniper school. 
BIGGLES Can you shoot? 
CHRIS I can hunt. And what's cooler than being a sniper? 
BIGGLES Blowing shit up. Blowing shit up is way cooler. 
A brunette steps to the bar. A sharp object with heavy eye-shadow and tight leather pants. This girl owns her sexuality but she's often been used for it. 
This is "TAYA". She is trying to ignore the advances of A SHORT NAVY GUY but he's relentless. Chris watches as (ECU)-- Taya's fingertips whiten, gripping her glass. 
Chris edges closer, she looks up, defensive-- but he just stands there, letting his protective presence be felt. 
DAPPER NAVY GUY (OC) Come on, just let me buy you a drink. 
TAYA (end of her rope) Will a drink make you 6 inches taller and charming? Will it make you not married? 
DAPPER NAVY GUY I'm not-- 
TAYA I watched you take your ring off. Don't be a scumbag. Go home.

Before Kincaid can finish, Gale buts in. 
GALE Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to. 
MILTON (flabbergasted) GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set! (to security) No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here. 
SECURITY GAURD (approaching) Yes, Mr. Milton. DETECTIVE KINCAID No, Mr. Milton, Miss Weathers is with me. 
Milton nods his head, flags down the guard. He walks away. 
MILTON Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then. 
GALE Oh come on! Why the hostility? 
MILTON Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions. 
GALE (shit-eating smile on her face) They're the ones who approved it. 
Milton storms off camera, Buddy following close behind. Gale looks up at Kincaid. 
GALE Alright Kincaid, no where to? 
DETECTIVE KINCAID I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers. 
GALE Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around. 
DETECTIVE KINCAID Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there. 
Kincaid hands Gale his card, begins to walk out of the building. 
GALE Shit. Can I even get a ride home? 
CUT TO: 
INT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
SIDNEY PRESCOTT, the stoic, survivor. Now 24, she lies peacefully in bed, her black lab PETE curled up in a ball at her feet. A noise startles the animal awake. It sets off the bed barking hysterically at -- 
THE BEDROOM WINDOW 
SIDNEY -- 
--awakens. She squints her eyes to try and make out what her dog is going into conniptions over. Then she sees, and her face loses any trace of color. 
MAUREEN PRESCOTT'S GHOSTLY WRAITH is pressed up against the window. She's wearing a tattered, blood soaked night shift.  Her voice is muted but her lips are moving as if trying torelay a message to Sidney. Sid's hysterical crying. She slidesoff her bed, makes her way towards the window when suddenly -- 
MAUREEN slides down the glass, as if being pulled by somethingbeneath the window sill. Something we don't see . . . yet. 
SIDNEY (crying) Mom! 
Left behind in her wake are five bloody streaks running downthe glass. The streaks begin to bleed, as if each wounds themselves. They bleed right through the glass. Sidneyreaches out to touch them when suddenly -- 
THE GHOST springs up behind the window, shatters the glass panewith his fist. SIDNEY screams -- 
AWAKENING IN BED FROM HER NIGHTMARE. 
Her dog's barking wildly. 
THE WINDOW is fine.

SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE 
Nancy Meyers June 14, 2002 
OVER BLACK 
We hear, Ja Rule's "Livin' It Up"... 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT - MUSIC OVER 
MIDTOWN. A Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body. A Club in THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT. A long line waits to get in. A couple of Gorgeous Girls show up at the velvet rope and are promptly" let inside. SOHO. A Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk. A Confident Knock Out in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking a beer out of the bottle. 
HARRY (V.O.) 
Ahhhh... The sweet, uncomplicated satisfaction of The Younger Woman. That fleeting age when everything just falls right into place. It's magic time and it can render any man, anywhere -- absolutely helpless. Some say I'm an expert on The Younger Woman. Guess that's 'cause I've been dating them for over forty years... 
INTO AN EMPTY FRAME COMES HARRY LANGER 
What is it about him? Could be his eyes, the turn of his mouth...something about this guy is just so damn appealing. Maybe it's just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his arm. He's confident, cool, enviable. We're in: 
A CHIC EATERY - DOWNTOWN 
The place is full. Everybody is somebody here. 
HARRY 
(to Hostess) Langer. .. The Maitre'd snaps to attention at the sight of him. 
MAITRE'D 
Mr. Langer, got your table waiting. As Harry and his Girl wend their way around tables, we pass Other Couples. Young Couples. Middle-aged couples. Not talking Couples. 
HARRY (V.O.) 
So what does a life of bucking the system all add up to? 
HARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D) 
To never settle down with the right woman for a life of leftovers and Christmas mornings. No his and her IRA accounts, no mini van parked in the garage. I think it's made me what I am today. (Harry smiles to someone across the room) The luckiest son of a bitch on earth. Look at me. I'm positively debonair. I should be illegal I'm lookin' so good. Harry passes a table where a BEATEN SIXTY YEAR OLD dines with his AGE APPROPRIATE, WELL-FED WIFE. IN SLOW MOTION, Harry and The Beaten Man catch each other's glance. 
HARRY (V.O.) 
It isn't as if I haven't wondered what my life would be like if I was a Regular Joe and came in here once a month with a dame my age' for a porterhouse and a side of I         spinach. I've wondered... 
NT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION 
Harry ENTERS all over again. This time he looks older, something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket. With him is a regular looking, nothing-to-write-home-about WOMAN 
IN HER FIFTIES. 
HARRY (V.O.) 
No, come on, let's be honest. ..a dame really my age. . . 
INT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION - TAKE TWO 
Again, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he looks ten years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The twinkle in his eye, long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD BATTLE AX, built just like Harry. The Maitre'd reluctantly shows them to a shitty table. 
HARRY (V.O.) 
There you have it. The story in a nutshell. Not exactly debonair, am I? (Harry TRIPS, his wife looks disgusted) Awww, man, it's down right sad. Look at me. I look like I'm about to die. God help me. I do not want to die. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
A LONG STRETCH OF PRISTINE COUNTRY ROAD - THE HAMPTONS - DAY 
A Silver Mercedes convertible bursts into FRAME. Harry's behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. Next to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An "IT" Girl. Smart, sexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art. Her hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year age difference between them. Her name is MARIN. She SINGS along with Ja Rule, now coming from a CD. 
MARIN 
( singing) To all my thugs that be livin' it up, we say, what I do. To all my... (stops) Oh! This is it. Make a right. 
HARRY 
(admiring the neighborhood) So baby, you're rich... . 
MARIN 
Well, my mother is, sort of. Not really... 
HARRY 
If she lives within a mile of here, she's rich. 
MARIN 
I guess a hit play will buy you a house in The Hamptons. 
HARRY 
I'd like to meet your mother. 
MARIN 
No you wouldn't. I mean, she's great. She's totally brilliant, but she's not your type. 
HARRY 
You're overlooking one of the great things about me. I don't have a type. 
MARIN 
(very directly) She's over thirty. Harry looks to Marin, feigning hurt. 
MARIN 
Oh, what?! Like you don't know you have a slight reputation for... 
Just then the CAR PHONE RINGS. Harry keeps looking at Marin. 
HARRY 
-- For what? Harry waits. RINGGG! He doesn't look away. 
MARIN 
For never dating anyone over 30. Don't look at me like that. 
HARRY 
It's just not true. 
MARIN 
Okay. Sorry. Over 31? 
HARRY 
Oh, so you wait 'til we get out to The Hamptons to let me know you're a wise ass. (answers phone) Hold on. . . (then to Marin) It just so happens, my dear, that women of a certain age, don't date me. You ever think of it that way? No, it's always me. You dames are all alike. (then into phone) Hey... 
MARIN 
(amused, to herself) Dames... Marin continues singing along with Ja Rule as Harry confidently slips his hand onto her thigh. 
BARRY 
(into phone) Vh-huh.. .I'll call back Monday. Who else? Monday... Monday... Say you couldn't find me. Who? (glances at Marin, she's not listening) I'll call her later. No, I have it. Harry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if' she caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that card. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass and the ocean stretch before them.

DEEP SPACE 
A darkness like no other, a silence that is unsettling. Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across the void of outer space. Our own motion is only realized as an enormous object slowly moves towards us, taking shape. A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size, a tubular freighter easily ten times larger then any aircraft carrier. At first glance it appears lifeless and adrift, but slowly the small glow of cockpit windows come into view as we move closer. Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN. 
BOWER (V.0.) Where were you... when Eden was lost? Like every other kid on my block, I was in the middle of a dream, envious of those who were chosen to be part of mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of the unknown and trying to imagine what only the lucky few would encounter. We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and... 
DISSOLVE THRU: 
INT. COCKPIT (EDEN) - CONT. 
Inside the flight deck it's ghostly vacant, rows of empty flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently blinking. With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over the seat backs... it appears the control deck has been suddenly evacuated. Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship. 
BOWER.(V.0.) As the entire world watched in wonder, there were only a few, skeptical of the journey's success. 
(BEAT) Only a few... who would be right. The further we move into the ship... signs of violence appear, smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the bright white paneling and several broken computer screens. The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer... an argument between men, panicked rage over-lapping. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: CAMERA slowly moves past a corner to see the middle-of a violent confrontation. One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic. Another OFFICER is on the floor, mortally wounded, his body still twitching with his head bashed in. The INSANE OFFICER, a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal, typing in commands with a casual and emotionless nature. Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose as he continues to type commands into the flight computer... heightening the trapped OFFICER'S muffled,. screams. 
TRAPPED OFFICER 
(IN FRENCH) 
STOP IT! STOP FOR GOD'S SAKES! PLEASE! 
GOD NO! The INSANE OFFICER hits the final command key and warning buzzers ignite with flashing lights. He closes his eyes, taking a breath of relief. 
TRAPPED OFFCIER 
(IN FRENCH) 
STOP IT! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL 
DO TO- YOU'RE NOT- STOP! YOU'RE GOING 
TO FUCKING KILL US ALL! The trapped OFFICER begins pounding on the glass with a crazed panic as the INSANE OFFICER calmly goes to his own sleep-pod and climbs inside, sealing the hatch. 
TRAPPED OFFCIER (CONT-D) 
(IN FRENCH) 
PLEASE GOD! NO! NO GOD DAMMIT! Control panels flash and hydraulics ignite. Like a row of tumbling dominos, each of the sleep-chamber pods shift positions with a SHUSH of hydraulics and then... they are launched with a ROAR of micro-jets. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SHIP "EDEN" - CONT. 
We're suddenly back into the unsettling silence as... like a bee hive that's exploded, thousands of coffin-sized sleep pods are ejected from the ship in unison. They are sent tumbling into open space in every direction as the ship slowly continues its unaffected course. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: The trapped OFFICER is seen SCREAMING in silence inside his own pod. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. OUTER SPACE 
We slowly float towards an astroid field. As we grow closer it's the sea of sleep pods slowly floating through space. 
BOWER (P.O.) Where was I... when I heard we'd lost Eden? Just like every other kid on my block... I was dreaming... of being one who would be chosen to follow. As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods, it's obvious that time has passed, a single skeleton inside each of the pods, hands in a clawing position towards the glass. We PUSH IN towards one pod, moving towards the SKULL, still locked in a SCREAMING position, wide mouthed and... 
CUT TO: 
M. HYPER-SLEEP CHAMBER A RUMBLE passes... EYELIDS TWITCH... A GASP. Inside a coffin-size chamber, a dim glow of light seeps through a small glass porthole. A MAN is asleep, a mask attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms. CORPORAL BOWER, military physique, chiseled features. His chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins. Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life, muscles flinching, breath quickening. He squirms with discomfort, ripping away the mask. He gasps, trying to SCREAM. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - CONT. 
His scream is muffled under three inches of glass. The hatch door is hit with a THUD and white gases erupt from the edges. THUD, THUD... THUD! The door bursts open and BOWER scampers out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the floor, naked and gasping. His pores ignite, dripping sweat. He tries to get to his feet, but his legs wobble underneath him, collapsing. He yells at the floor. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOWER Burns are red! Bruises... blue- His voice echoes into the dark, alone in a cavernous room as he pauses, struggling for orientation. He gets to his feet, muscles twitching. His short-cropped hair is... pure white.

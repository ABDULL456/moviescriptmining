PHIL So what happens when it gets the right answer? 
INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY 
As McConnell looks at Luke and Terri. 
MCCONNELL (hesitates) I don't know. But we've got to find out. (to Luke, pointing) Can you work this the other way? Figure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes? Then dub them into your recording of the signal? 
LUKE I think so, yes. 
MCCONNELL What about the radar gun? Will it accept that input? Can we transmit a completed signal back to the Face? 
Luke stares at him, startled by what he's implying. 
INT. ERV COCKPIT. DAY 
Phil is also growing increasingly nervous. 
PHIL Whoa, whoa, hold on, Jim. What if you're wrong? Whoever goes out there... I mean, what if you're wrong? Three people have already died over that thing. 
INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY 
As Luke and Terri look tensely at McConnell. 
TERRI Four. 
McConnell looks at her. 
MCCONNELL Terri, if we leave here without getting some answers, they all died in vain. 
Terri shakes her head. 
TERRI We just don't know enough about that -- that thing out there to take any more chances. 
MCCONNELL What are we here for, if not to take chances...? 
His passion startles them; they've never seen him so emotional. He points at the computer screen. 
MCCONNELL This means we're not alone. It means we're on the brink of the greatest discovery in mankind's history. But we've still got to prove it. Who knows when someone else will get back here? Or if they ever will? You know what Congress is like. They'll say it's too dangerous, too much loss of life, let's go back to unmanned flights. We could be the last explorers to come here for decades. We're it, guys. (pause) We're it. 
LUKE (quietly) We don't have to go out there. There's a better way. 
They look at him, surprised.

EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY 
The familiar, plucky little figure of ARES-8 wheels across ocher sand, with the radar gun jury-rigged onto its back. Ares' video snout WHIRRS out, extending. The familiar bass rumble of the Face is very loud from here. 
LUKE Checking video feed... 
INT. MARS ONE HAB. LATE DAY 
McConnell, Terri, and Phil have gathered around Luke as he pushes buttons, and a monitor CRACKLES to life. White streaks, then a blurry image, which he tries to enhance. Finally the image starts to sharpen. 
LUKE There! 
ON THE MONITOR 
They see the familiar stark white profile of the FACE, shot from ground level, in a SLOWLY APPROACHING ANGLE... 
THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS 
Stare at the ominous sight. They're all more nervous than they want to show. Luke's fingers delicately work a joystick as he maneuvers the remote surveyor. 
MCCONNELL How close do we need to get? 
LUKE I'm not sure. Maybe we better stop by that boulder. 
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY 
Ares-8 whines to a stop by a large boulder, which partially shields it from the Face, looming beyond. The radar gun swivels, locating its target. Then stops, ready to fire. 
INT. MARS ONE HAB. LATE DAY 
Luke looks at Terri, Phil, and McConnell. Phil shuts the lid of the box holding the new nav boards, snaps it protectively down. He nods. Terri takes a deep breath, then she nods. 
Luke's hand hovers over the red firing button; a moment of awesome uncertainty and danger. He looks at McConnell, who finally gives a nod of command. Then Luke hits the button. 
EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY 
From the radar gun on Ares-8's back, a sharp, high-pitched electronic burst is emitted, pulsating like a tuning fork as it's fired towards the Face. After a few seconds it stops. 
For a moment nothing happens. 
Then the deep bass rumbling stops as well. The only remaining sound is of WIND, stirring up dust on the Martian plains. 
ANGLE ON THE FACE 
As suddenly a huge, curved segment of the white surface begins to rise from the earth, like a gigantic hangar door, sliding out of sight into an upper sheath of some kind. The movement is measured, stately, utterly silent. As the segment rises, it reveals a blinding white light: the interior of the Face. No inside details can be seen. 
INT. MARS ONE HAB. DAY 
McConnell, Luke, Terri and Phil stare at this phenomenon, awed. They're barely breathing. 
PHIL Oh my God...

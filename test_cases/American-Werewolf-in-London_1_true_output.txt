They keep walking. 
JACK What do you think was wrong? 
DAVID I have no idea. 
JACK Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural. 
DAVID I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly. There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly illuminating sheet of light over the boys' faces.  The clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling. 
DAVID Please don't rain. 
Downpour.  The boys are walking in a deluge. 
DAVID Of course. 
They walk getting soaked. 
JACK Say, David.... 
DAVID I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you. 
Jack spreads his arms and sings. 
JACK Santa Lucia...Santa Lucia. 
9    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT 
The rain is loud on the roof and beating on the windows.  The gathered continue to drink, play chess and darts, but all are silent and contemplative. 
WOMAN Perhaps they'll be safe in the rain. 
The Chess Player slams his hand on the table.  Shouts: 
CHESS PLAYER No one brought them here!  No one wanted them here! 
WOMAN You could have told them! 
DART PLAYER Are you daft?  What do you think they'd say?  They'd think us mad. 
WOMAN Listen! 
The rain is subsiding.  There is a very faint howl. 
WOMAN Did you hear it?  We must go to them. 
DART PLAYER I heard nothing. 
CHESS PLAYER Nor I. 
The camera lingers as the Chess Player's hard face shows the man's struggle.  Another howl.  The Chess Player turns suddenly. 
10   EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT 
David and Jack are now completely out of sight from East Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet.  There is a light drizzle.  They are standing, listening.  The drizzle stops. 
JACK Did you hear that? 
DAVID I heard that. 
JACK What was it? 
David begins to walk, Jack with him. 
DAVID Could be a lot of things. 
JACK Yeah?

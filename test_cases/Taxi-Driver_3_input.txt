Travis kicks and protests as Tom leads him to the front door. 
ON THE SIDEWALK 
Travis' efforts quickly subside when Tom motions to a nearby POLICEMAN.  Travis quiets down and walks off. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. 
Travis is again making his way through the garish urban night. He stops for a PASSENGER on PARK AVE. A middle-aging professorial executive. 
C.U. TRAVIS: His face is expressionless.  The MAN makes himself comfortable in the back seat. 
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER Jackson Heights. 
Travis has no intention of driving out to Jackson Heights and coming back with a fare. 
TRAVIS I'm off duty. 
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER You mean you don't want to go out to Jackson Heights? 
TRAVIS No, I'm off duty. 
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER Then how come your "Off Duty" light wasn't on. 
TRAVIS switches on the "Off Duty" light. 
TRAVIS It was on. (gesturing toward top of taxi) it just takes a while to warm up. Like a TV. 
TRAVIS doesn't budge. PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER curses to himself and exits cab. Travis takes off. 
POV as Travis' eyes dwell on the young HIP COUPLES coming out of a East Side movie house. 
LATER THAT NIGHT, TRAVIS pulls over for a young (mid- twenties) MAN wearing a leather sports jacket. 
TRAVIS eyes his passenger in rear-view mirror. 
YOUNG PASSENGER 471 Central Park West. 
EXT. 
TRAVIS' taxi speeds off. 
LATER, TRAVIS' taxi slows down as it approaches 400 block of Central Park West. 
Travis checks apartment numbers. 
YOUNG PASSENGER Just pull over to the curb a moment. 
TRAVIS turns the wheel. 
YOUNG PASSENGER Yeah, that's fine. Just sit here. 
TRAVIS waits impassively. The motor ticks away. 
After a long pause, the PASSENGER speaks: 
YOUNG PASSENGER Cabbie, ya see that light up there on the seventh floor, three windows from this side of the building? 
CAMERA CLOSES IN on 417 Central Park West: TRACKING UP to the seventh floor, it moves three windows to the right. 
TRAVIS (V.O.) Yeah. 
A young WOMAN wearing a slip crosses in front of the light. 
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.) Ya see that woman there? 
TRAVIS (O.S.) Yeah. 
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.) That's my wife. (a beat) But it ain't my apartment. (a beat) A nigger lives there. (a beat) She left me two weeks ago. It took me this long to find out where she went. (a beat) I'm gonna kill her. 
C.U. TRAVIS' face: it is devoid of expression. 
YOUNG PASSENGER What do you think of that, cabbie?

CHRIS I don't care. I just wanna get wet. 
TIGHT ON DANNY. He flips through a book titled TURNER DIARIES. On the nightstand to his left is a digital clock that reads 4:47 p.m. 
DANNY I've been trying to buy this.  You can't find it anywhere. 
The two look at Dan. 
JASON Cammeron dropped us off a copy. Dope fucking shit, man. It's all about reclaiming the country. I'll let you read it when I'm done. 
DANNY Fuck that. I just read Mein Kampf. 
JASON There you go. 
CHRIS Hey? What was this Daryl shit you were talking about? 
DANNY Henry Hastings almost kicked Daryl Dawson's ass. He would're too if-- 
CHRIS Little Henry the negroid? 
Danny nods. 
DANNY Everyday there's something over there, man. 
CHRIS Why do you think we fuckin' quit? 
DANNY I hear you. 
JASON Daryl Dawson's a pussy faggot. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BOARDWALK - DANNY, JASON AND CMRIS - LATER 
The three skateboard down the strand, Jason and Chris with their surfboardS and suits. Chris looks at Jason's shirt. 
CHRIS What's ZOG again? 
JASON Zionist somethin'. 
DANNY Zionist-Occupational-Government. 
Ahead an OLD ASIAN WOMAN tows a succession of SHOPPING CARTS. As Jason passes, he smacks her with his surfboard and knocks her to the ground. They all laugh and Danny breaks off and heads east on Rose. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DUMPY APARTMENT - TIGHT ON TEARY EYES 
DAVINA VINYARD, in a UCLA T-SHIRT and panties, cries on the couch as she hugs a LONG HAIRED Derek. DORIS sobs as she lays under a pink blanket, burdened by the flu. Shirtless Derek grabs Doris' hand and leans over to kiss her. 
DEREK It's gonna be fine. 
EXT. DUMPY APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Danny skates up to his residence and looks at a car across the street. Two plainclothes cops from the earlier meeting sit in their car and stare from afar. Danny goes through the gate. 
iNT. HOUSE- SAME 
Danny walks in on the tearful family conclave.  He stands there, wishing the day would just end. 
DANNY Oh man--! Come on!  What are you crying about now? 
THE PHONE RINGS and Derek rushes down the hall to get it. 
DEREK I got it. 
Danny looks to his mother. 
DANNY Are you feeling better at all? 
DORIS I need a kiss. 
Danny wipes away her tears, kisses her, and moves away quickly so he won't get sick. 
INT. BEDROOM - DEREK ON THE PHONE 
He listens to the man on the other line. 
DEREK Unhuh. Unhuh. Did you expel him?

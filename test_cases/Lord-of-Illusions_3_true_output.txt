HARRY Oh Jeez. 
SWANN Will that do?  No? 
Swann coughs again.  Puts his hand to his mouth.  A DELUGE of QUARTERS runs between his fingers. 
SWANN That better? 
The Cashier gapes. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - GROUNDS - DUSK 
The house could not look more reassuringly calm.  A SWAN struts beside the pool.  A long, HUSHED MOMENT... 
SHOCK CUT TO: 
DOROTHEA'S DREAM 
A BABOON SHRIEKS, its mouth filling the frame. 
CUT WIDE, to reveal the Baboon, racing around Nix's Sanctum, crazed. 
Hanging on the sculpture that swings from the roof is a shadowy figure.  Is it Nix?  We can't quite see.  Black BLOOD runs from the figure and splashes on the ground. 
NOW WE SEE DOROTHEA, being pulled by the Cultists towards the falling gouts of dark fluid -- 
-- she struggles, SOBBING -- CUT TO: 
INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
She tosses around on the bed 
BACK TO: 
DOROTHEA'S DREAM 
-- Dorothea has a GUN in her hand.  The Cultists shake it from her grip, and pull her directly under the BLOOD -- as it SPLASHES on her upturned face -- 
INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
A SOUND. Dorothea wakes, distressed by the dream.  She gets up and goes out onto -- 
INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LANDING - DUSK 
Looks down the stairs. 
DOROTHEA Who's there? 
Silence.  Then, Valentin speaks behind her.  She jumps. 
VALENTIN I'm sorry. 
BLOOD runs from his cut face. 
DOROTHEA Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face? 
BUTTERFIELD (V.O.) It was me. 
She turns.  He's on her in a heartbeat, pressing her back against the wail. 
BUTTERFIELD Guess who we're going to see? 
INT. HARRY'S CAR - DUSK 
Harry drives.  Swann takes a throatful of brandy.  Then he stares at Harry. 
SWANN You think I'm an asshole. 
HARRY Didn't know you read minds. 
SWANN (a warning) I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that. (an apology) So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about... 
HARRY Is that all? 
SWANN I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die. 
HARRY And you're not? 
Silence for a moment. 
SWANN Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations. 
HARRY And he didn't have them? 
SWANN He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks. 
HARRY Is that all?

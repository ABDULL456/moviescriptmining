{"test1_input": "THE DEPARTED \nWritten by \nWilliam Monahan \nBased on Infernal Affairs \nSCRIPT AS SHOT COMPILED SEPTEMBER 2006 \nFADE UP ON \nTHE SOUTH BOSTON HOUSING PROJECTS. A MAZE OF BUILDINGS AGAINST THE HARBOR. \nCOSTELLO (V.O.) I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product...of me. \nYELLOW RIPPLES PAST THE CAMERA AND WHEN IT CLEARS WE SEE THROUGH DIESEL SMOKE: A BUSING PROTEST IN PROGRESS. THE SCHOOL-BUS, FULL OF BLACK KIDS, IS HIT WITH BRICKS, ROCKS. N.B.: (THIS IS NOT SETTING THE LIVE ACTION IN 1974; IT IS A HISTORICAL MONTAGE, THE BACKGROUND FOR COSTELLO'S V.O.). \nINT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY. \nCOSTELLO's profile passes in a dark room. \nCOSTELLO (V.O.) Years ago, we had the Church. That was only a way of saying we had each other. The Knights of Columbus were head-breakers. They took over their piece of the city. \nEXT. SOUTHIE. VARIOUS \nThe neighborhood. 1980's. We won't be here long. This isn't where Costello ends up. It's where he began. Liquor stores with shamrocked signs. MEN FISHING near Castle Island. Catholic SCHOOLKIDS playing in an asphalted schoolyard. \nCOSTELLO (V.O.) Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get a job, we had the presidency. That's what the niggers don't realize. If I got one thing against the black chaps it's this. No one gives it to you. You have to take it. \nINT. LUNCH COUNTER. DAY \nCOSTELLO comes in. The shop is one that sells papers, sundries, fountain drinks...and fronts a bookie operation. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (leaning over cluttered counter) Don't make me have to come down here again. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPROPRIETOR Won't happen again, Mr. C. \nThe frightened proprietor hands over money. Fifty bucks, a hundred, doesn't matter. COSTELLO is never the threatener. His demeanor is gentle, philosophical. Almost a shrink's probing bedside manner. He has great interest in the world as he moves through it. As if he originally came from a different world and his survival in this one depends on close continual observation and analysis. \nYOUNG COLIN looks up. CLOSE ON his eyes. He is fourteen or fifteen, but small for his age. Bookish. \nCOSTELLO eyes the proprietor's TEENAGE DAUGHTER, working behind the counter. He takes a propane lighter, and, strangely, pays for it (the proprietor startled) and waits for change. He lights a MORE cigarette with the lighter. \nYOUNG COSTELLO Carmen's developing into a fine young lady. You should be proud. You get your period yet, Carmen? \nThe PROPRIETOR is uneasy. COSTELLO turns to YOUNG COLIN (about 14) staring at the local hero. Costello reaches up above and behind the counter and takes down some cigarettes. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) You Johnny Sullivan's kid? \nCOLIN nods. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) You live with your grandmother? \nCOLIN nods. \nYOUNG COLIN Yeah. \nCOSTELLO tells the Proprietor to takes three loaves of bread and some soup off the shelves and puts them in Colin's bag. \nCOSTELLO Get him three loaves of bread. And a couple of half gallons of milk. And some soup. \nHe goes over to the fridge and puts two half gallons of milk in the bag. Some soup. Costello turns to Colin. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) Do you like comic books? \nColin nods.   He adds a couple of comic books. \nWhen the PROPRIETOR looks at him, he takes out the money he put in his pocket and gives back half. \nYOUNG COSTELLO You do good in school? \nYOUNG COLIN nods, holding the big bag of loot. \nCOLIN Yes. \nYOUNG COSTELLO That's good. I did good in school. They call that a paradox. \nHe gives some money to Carmen. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) Buy yourself some makeup. Keep the change. \nLooks intently at COLIN to see if he gets it.    Colin does. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) You ever want to earn a little extra money, you come by L street. You know where I am on L street. \nCOLIN nods: everybody does. \nYOUNG COLIN Thank you. \nHe pushes out with the bags of groceries. \nThe PROPRIETOR can do shit about it. \nYOUNG COSTELLO watches YOUNG COLIN go off down a slummy street. \nINT. A CHURCH. MORNING. 1985-ISH \nYOUNG COLIN, the good boy, the very good boy, is serving at a funeral Mass. Various views of the church. Stained-glass light. The altar is still wreathed in the smoke of incense. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPRIEST (V.O.) To you, O Lord we commend the soul of Alphonsus, your Servant; in the sight of this world he is now dead; in your sight may he live forever. Forgive whatever sins he committed through human weakness and in your goodness grant him everlasting peace. \nALL Amen. \n", "test1_true": "PRIEST (VO) May the angels lead you into paradise; May the martyrs come to welcome you and take you to the holy city, The new and eternal Jerusalem. \nA liturgical bell tings. \nINT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY \nCOSTELLO is talking informally (we realize that this is a continuation of the philosophical talk, the shadowy pacing). YOUNG KIDS. Useful young men. YOUNG COLIN, three years older, is among them. \nYOUNG COSTELLO Church wants you in your place. What sort of man wants to be kept in his place? Do this don't do that, kneel, stand, kneel, stand...I mean if you go for that sort of thing... \nYOUNG COLIN, the recent altar boy, visibly doesn't go for that sort of thing. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) I don't know what to do for you. A man makes his own way. No one gives it to you. You have to take it. (a beat) Non serviam. \nYOUNG COLIN James Joyce. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nYOUNG COSTELLO Him and Lucifer. And me. (to the room) Guineas from the North End and down Providence, tried to tell me what to do...And something maybe happened to them. \nEXT. A REMOTE BEACH. DAWN \nRose-colored dawn. YOUNG COSTELLO, with a pistol, executes a MAN kneeling in the surf. She falls on the body of a man who has just been executed. \nCOSTELLO Jeez, she fell funny. \nFRENCH moves forward with an axe in his hand. \nFRENCH Frank, you gotta see somebody. \nThey go about their business. \nINT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY \nYOUNG COSTELLO walking, talking...Not continuous with the above. We see that only YOUNG COLIN is present. \nYOUNG COSTELLO You decide to be something, you can be it. That's what they don't tell you, the Church. \nMISTER FRENCH is doing books off behind a window of dirty glass. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) When I was your age, they would say, we become cops or criminals. Today, what I'm saying to you is this: When you are facing a loaded gun... \nvery close on COSTELLO, holding Colin's shoulder. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) What's the difference? \nECU: COLIN'S EYES swerve up. We are now on (MATURE) COLIN'S EYES eyes. This is how the character transits the \"age leap\"...on the unchanging eyes. \nTHE SAME EYES. \nPull back to reveal: \nPOLICE TRAINEES. (INCLUDING BARRIGAN, who is included in all Colin's trainee scenes). COLIN is in the class, wearing a trainee's uniform. He has a notebook, a pen. Writing. \nINSTRUCTOR The slug enters the skull by forming a small entrance hole. Blood and brain matter is ejected backwards from this hole. The bullet, which may expand, fragment or tumble, then passes through the brain... \nCOLIN writes. \nINT. FIRING RANGE. DAY \nPOLICE TRAINEES ON A FIRING RANGE. As we go along the line we see COLIN, firing dry and then speed-changing a clip in a BERETTA 92F. He is a perfect trainee. \nEXT. A TRAINING FIELD. DAY \nSTATE POLICE TRAINEES standing in a pissing rain, a DI yelling at them OS. COLIN is staring forward. RAIN streaming down his face. His opinion on the experience is not decipherable. Ad libs: \"Sir, yes, sir.\" \nEXT. THE BOSTON COMMON. DAY \nGuys we recognize from the previous shots at the State Police Academy (wearing Statie t-shirts), including COLIN and BARRIGAN, are playing rugby against some FIREFIGHTERS. Very rough game. The game breaks up with each group giving each other the finger. FIREFIGHTERS are moving away triumphantly. \nCOLIN Fucking firemen are getting pussy for the first time in the history of fire. Or pussy. \nCOLIN sits on a bench looking at THE GOLD DOME OF BEACON HILL. The terraces of fine townhouses. Aqueous golden light behind. Misty golden beauty. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIGAN What are you looking at? Forget it. Your father was a janitor, and his son's only a cop. \nCOLIN (not vainglorious, but innocently stretching for the idea) You're in trouble if you're \"only\" anything. \nBARRIGAN Don't tell me I'm looking at the first dickhead-American president of the United States. \nCOLIN doesn't have a great sense of humor but he knows how to pretend that he does. He smiles. \nEXT. STATE POLICE GRADUATION CEREMONY. DAY \nBagpipes and bullshit. Flags cracking. Line after line of paramilitary-looking graduates, among them COLIN. \nSPEAKER (V.O.) The Massachusetts State Police has a long tradition of excellence. Your graduation today solidifies your acceptance into one of the finest law enforcement agencies in our nation. As the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am confident each and every one of you will serve with distinction, honor and integrity. \nCAMERA swirls around COLIN as he moves, a lone person, through the breaking up crowd. Other graduates are hugged by family. COLIN, alone, comes to the gates of the yard. \nTHE MAYOR VO Congratulations. You are dismissed. \nThe bagpipe band plays \"Minstrel Boy.\" \nCOLIN'S POV: \nAN OLDSMOBILE. COSTELLO and MISTER FRENCH standing by the car. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOLIN walks over to the car. COSTELLO gives COLIN a BOX. COLIN flips open the top and then quickly closes it. NOTE: The box could contain an eyeball, money, drugs, a picture of Colin fucking his school teacher...we will never know. \nCOSTELLO School's out. You earned it. Yeah, no more teachers, no more books. \nINT. AN EXAMINATION ROOM. DAY \n", "test1_id": 1542, "test2_input": "ANOTHER STREET painted with neon light (quiet). \nBILLY'S POV: \nCOLIN is halfway down the street. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY follows. \nBILLY is nearly up to COLIN on this quieter street \n(And COLIN is aware of the tail) \nwhen... \nBILLY'S cellphone rings. His phone has fucked up, as they do. Instead of turning around, COLIN accelerates. The only thing on his agenda is to not have his face seen. \nBILLY spins into a door-opening and silences the ringer. \nTEXT MESSAGE DETAIL Make arrest. \nCOLIN takes a right at the end of the street, into an alley. \nEXT. AROUND THE NEXT CORNER. MOMENTS LATER \nCOLIN is waiting, in a doorway of his own. He has a knife open in his hand. He waits, listening to (faltering) footsteps: a MAN, face invisible in shadow, turns the corner. COLIN pulls him into the doorway and rips upwards with a knife. \nAs the body falls we see: it isn't Billy. It's a CHINESE MAN. COLIN backs away in horror, and hurries off down the street. \nEXT. ANOTHER STREET. MOMENTS LATER \nCOLIN, sweating, staggering, hurries along. No sign of Billy, no sign of a follower. But he does notice: CCTV cameras at the intersection. He spins and gets out of there, heading off through. CHINATOWN. Colin, holding his envelope, walks, sweating, fast, then faster, past repeated ideograms in neon (the ideograms say--flash--\"Departed\"). \nEXT. CHINATOWN. MOMENTS LATER \nBILLY has lost Colin. He hears a hubbub from the corner where a small crowd of Chinese speakers is gathering and pushes through the crowd to see: blood running on the pavement. BILLY backs away, gets out of there. \nINT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT \nCOLIN is looking at CCTV tapes. We see COLIN, unrecognizable on cheap video. Then we see a blurred image of BILLY. Crossing the street in beats. No more use as ID than the Shroud of Turin. \nEXT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. NIGHT (RAINING) \nThrough grated windows we can see Madolyn finishing up her packing. BILLY KNOCKS on the door, which leads only into Madolyn's basement apartment. A long beat and she opens the door. The chain on. \nBILLY Your name's on the pill label. I thought you weren't supposed to be in the book, in case of obsessive patients. \nMADOLYN How obsessive are you? \nBILLY Medium. \nMADOLYN Are you okay? Why are you here? \nBILLY I really liked our conversations. I've been...regretting that we didn't continue...our conversations. \nMADOLYN I'm glad you want to see me...it's nice to see you...I enjoyed talking...I enjoyed having coffee with you, very much...but I don't see people...I don't see people in my home. \nBilly gets soaked. \nINT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS \nBILLY looks around and sees: boxes, transition. The furniture already gone. An air-mattress on the floor. There are still tea things on the counter. A basic life is still possible here. Madolyn has been making tea here, sleeping here, reading in bed. Billy, soaked, a drowned rat, is looking vulnerable and honest. \nBILLY Thanks. If this is inappropriate... I can leave. \nMADOLYN takes a moment to react. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMADOLYN No, it's, it's, it's not inappropriate...you're not a patient... \nBILLY You moving in or out? \nMADOLYN I still have three weeks on the lease... \nBILLY is looking at THE PICTURE to which Colin objected. A young girl in front of a rust belt slum, tilted in a box of effects. \nMADOLYN (CONT'D) That's me. \nBILLY Yeah, I know. \nHe hangs the picture on a nail. \nMADOLYN (the kettle whistles OS) Would you like a cup of tea? \nBILLY nods. \nBILLY Yeah. Yeah I would. Thank you. \nMadolyn leaves him looking vaguely around the apartment. In the kitchen, it appears that Madolyn has forgotten how to make a cup of tea. She perseveres, comes out holding two cups. Billy is looking at the handful of books still in the apartment. \nMADOLYN Do you want some... \nBILLY Sugar?   No... \nShe hands him the cup of tea. Strung out, he spills his tea, slightly, unobserved by Madolyn. Madolyn looks over at the bed, the book, the lamp, the incontrovertible evidence that she's probably really, in fact, not that into Colin.. \nMADOLYN I've always needed my own place. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBILLY Hedging your bets? \nMADOLYN No. I'm not \"hedging my best\"...I told you when we had coffee...There's a choice. You choose...you have to make a... \nBILLY Decision. \nMADOLYN ...decision...and stick by what...you choose...you have to... \n", "test2_true": "MADOLYN Yes. Stick by what you...otherwise it's... I have to say that your vulnerability is really freaking me out right now. Is it real? \nBILLY Yeah, I think so. \nTick...tick...tick. \nBILLY (CONT'D) You don't have cats. \nMADOLYN No. \nBILLY I like that. That's good. \nINT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT \nColin is still studying the blurry image of Billy. \nINT. MADOLYN'S BASEMENT APARTMENT. NIGHT \nIn the tiny kitchen BILLY is kissing MADOLYN and unbuttoning her shirt. Her hands start to move to push him away. He continues. \nINT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT \nStill studying the blurry image of Billy, COLIN tenses as someone comes into the office and switches off the tape. He glances at his coat. The envelope is visible folded into the breast pocket. He takes his coat and goes. \nEXT. CHARLES STREET. NIGHT \nWet empty streets. The \"gaslights\" are on. About midnight. \nINT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. NIGHT \nA Costello business. The restaurant is closed for the night. One bartender is sweeping up and the other is counting the takings. In a darker alcove of the bar COSTELLO sits alone at a broad table, drinking brandy. On sound, classical music. As a knocking is heard Costello looks up. A BARTENDER lets Billy in. COSTELLO watches Billy approach. We hear him sit down. \nCOSTELLO You got a girlfriend? \nBILLY No.   No.   What does that matter? \nCOSTELLO Depends. I'm sure you know by now there's an informer in my crew. Cop. Staties or Boston Police department, I'm not sure. \nHe pours Billy some brandy. Then starts to draw a sketch. \nBILLY What about the FBI. \nCOSTELLO It ain't. Trust me. The ex-wife, an old friend or stupid...that's what brings you down in this business. \nBILLY Stupid...Well, that leaves me out. \nCOSTELLO Past days, case like this...I killed everybody who works for me. \nBILLY Better safe than sorry, I suppose. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOSTELLO On the other hand, back then, it was only five...or six...and French. \nBut COSTELLO, maybe, is sorry. \nBILLY I look around at your guys. They're all murderers right? I think \"could I do murder?\" And all I can answer myself is, \"what's the difference\". \nCOSTELLO Give em up to the Almighty.   Like that. \nBILLY Yeah, that's my point. You accuse me once, I put up with it. You accuse me twice, I quit. If you make me fear for my life, I put a fucking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else. \nCOSTELLO looks up. This is new: but he's impassive. And impressed. \nCOSTELLO (to Billy) You got something you want to say to me, William? \nBILLY You're seventy fucking years old. One of these guys is going to pop you. As for running drugs, what the fuck. You don't need the pain in the ass, and they're going to catch you. And you don't need the money. \nCOSTELLO smiles, and continues with the sketch.    Later he will light up the paper. \nCOSTELLO I haven't needed \"the money\" since I took Archie's milk money in the third grade. Tell the truth, I don't need pussy any more,but I still like it. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) COSTELLO (CONT'D) Point I'm making...you see...I got this rat...gnawing, cheese eating fucking rat...questions come up...questions...see, Bill, you're the new guy...and the girlfriend. Why don't you stay in the bar when I get the numbers. Your numbers. Everybody's numbers. \nBILLY Is there something you want to ask me, Frank? \nCOSTELLO Start with, you agree there is a rat? \nBILLY You said there is one. I base most of what I do on the idea that you're pretty fucking good at what you do. \nCOSTELLO Sure, sure, all that aside...but you Bill, what would you do? \nCOSTELLO sketching. \nBILLY How many of these guys been with you long enough to be disgruntled? Who needs more money than you pay them? You don't pay much, you know. It's almost a feudal fuckin' enterprise. (COSTELLO nods, accepting this) The question is, who thinks that they would do what you do better than you? \nCOSTELLO Only one that can do what I do is me. You want to be me? \nBILLY stares over a precipice: he knows this as well. \nBILLY I probably could be you. I know that much. But I don't want to be you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nCOSTELLO Heavy lies the crown...sort of thing. \nFRENCH comes in from the kitchen. \nMISTER FRENCH Francis. \nBARTENDER We're out of here, Mister Costello. You'll have to set the alarm. \nCOSTELLO (eyes on Billy) Thank you, Jimmy. See you tomorrow. \nON SOUND the door closes and locks. \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) There's a boat coming in, up in Gloucester. French will give you all the details. \n", "test2_id": 1543, "test3_input": "COLIN instantly raises the pistol to shoot him. \nCOLIN Did you give me up? \nCOLIN'S PISTOL wavers. \nCOSTELLO Nobody knows nothin'. \nCOLIN shakes his head and cocks the gun. \nCOLIN Frank, Frank, do they know about me? \nCOSTELLO I know you, Colin. You know I'd never give you up. You're like... \nCOLIN A son...to you? Is that what it is about, all that murderin' and fuckin' and no sons? What are you, shooting blanks? \nCOSTELLO tries to raise his gun which is inside his sleeve. He's sitting on his coat so that the shot goes off sideways as COLIN shoots him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCOSTELLO topples backward into the bucket of the bucket loader. \nANGLE ON COLIN. \nThen from the bucket loader, a post death tremor sets off one last shot from COSTELLO'S gun. Ricochet. COLIN fires into the dead body again and again. He backs away. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) I got Costello! I got Costello here! \nINT. POLICE HQ/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT \nColin is debriefed concerning the shooting of Costello. [Dialog separate document]. \nINT. BULLPEN AREA. DAY \nCOLIN enters, tired from a debriefing. Applause from everyone in the office--the full crew. COLIN is embarrassed by the attention. BROWN is leading the whole team to a standing ovation. COLIN looks past the heads of the crowd and sees: Dignam, staring at him evenly. \nCOLIN (to crowd) It's not any reason for, ah... \nQUEENAN'S SECRETARY brings him some wine. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) Thank you. \nQUEENAN'S SECRETARY No, thank you. \nHe takes a glass of wine. Then guiltily, almost in tears, he drinks. BROWN jerks a thumb towards Colin's office #2. \nBROWN He's waited a long time for you. (COLIN looks up and sees BILLY) How'd you get him without the files? \nCOLIN Caller ID. On Queenan's phone. You know that guy? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBROWN Yeah, we were classmates together. \nCOLIN I'm gonna go talk to him. \nCOLIN goes off. \nINT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. NIGHT \nIn Colin's office BILLY sits with his ankle on his knee. He looks very tired, dirty. Wearing a VISITOR badge. \nCOLIN Good to see you Trooper. \nBILLY Yeah.   \"Trooper\". \nCOLIN Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone. How long have you been undercover? \nBILLY Long time.     Long fuckin' time. \nCOLIN I can't begin to tell you what a debt we owe you. I want you to know I'll be recommending you for the Medal of Merit. \nBILL Medal of Merit. Oh, yeah. That's kinda like a gold star around here, right? \nCOLIN It's the highest honor we got. \nBILLY I just want my identity back. \nCOLIN You want to be a cop again? \nBILLY No, being a cop's not an identity. I want my identity back. \nCOLIN takes it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY (CONT'D) You'll have to excuse me. My only contact has been with a police shrink. \nCOLIN (throat clicks) A police shrink. (instead of asking the obvious) Was that... helpful for you? \nBILLY What are you gonna do about the rat in this building? \nCOLIN I'm gonna find him. Don't you worry about that. You got anything? Did Frank, ah, say anything... \nBILLY I'm all done being a cop. I just want to get my money and go home. \nCOLIN Fair enough. You've given a lot. I can get you your file. I just need your password. \nBILLY The password's my name, William Costigan, Jr. They gave it to me in case something happened to them and I had to explain myself to someone like you. \nHe writes it.    Colin takes the paper and hides his astonishment. \nCOLIN All right, Bill. Just give me a minute. I'm gonna go in the other room. This computer's gone blooey on me. \nBilly nods.    He goes. \nINT. COMPUTER ROOM. NIGHT \nCOLIN accesses the personal database, enters the password. Billy's confidential file opens up. Every fact about the man. Photos. \n", "test3_true": "Billy takes a drink from the bottle COLIN has put on the desk. As he puts the bottle down he sees, sticking out of a box, a BROWN ENVELOPE. On it is written \"CITIZENS.\" BILLY picks up the envelope...and knows everything. \nINT. COMPUTER ROOM. CONTINUOUS \nCOLIN is reviewing it Billy's file. Outside the glass wall we see BILLY, staring at COLIN's back...and then moving on. \nINT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. LATER \nCOLIN enters, holding a printout of Billy's personnel file. He looks around the empty room. He sees the BROWN ENVELOPE lying on the desk, and understands everything. He sits down at his own computer--which does in fact work, and opens the personnel file. \nCOLIN clicks DELETE. \"Do You Really Want to Delete?\" COLIN clicks \"Yes\" and Billy's picture, file, life, disappear. \nEXT. POLICE BUILDING. NIGHT \nBILLY exits the police building and moves across the plaza. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MADOLYN'S OFFICE - DAY \nBILLY waits outside Madolyn's office. \nMADOLYN, carrying work, breakfast, rounds the corner and sees him standing and waiting for her. She's a little spooked, opens her mouth to speak... \nBILLY I know. I'm not here to...I'm not here for that. I've got something to...to give to you...something I need you to keep. For me. \nMADOLYN What is it? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY (stopping her from speaking) I need you to be my friend here and not ask any questions. That's for you to hold. \nHe gives her a manila envelope. \nBILLY (CONT'D) Only you. Open this if I'm dead or if I call you and tell you to open it. Please do exactly what it says. Exactly what it says, please. \nMadolyn is a friend. She's not going to ask questions.           She accepts the envelope. \nMADOLYN All right. \nBILLY I'm sorry to show up here like this. There was no one else I could give it to. I'm sorry. There was no one else. \nHe backs away, and then turns to go. \nMADOLYN I...we... (he turns) I've, it's, been so confused... I just want to say... \nHe turns and looks at her.          She doesn't speak: can't. \nBILLY Whatever you have to say, really think about it, and if you still want to tell me, tell me in two weeks, all right? \nShe moves her head slightly, watches him go. \nINT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER. \nMADOLYN sits at her desk, devastated, looking at a fall of light. The envelope lies on her blotter. She sits on ... then straightens up, takes a marker and writes \"COSTIGAN\" on the envelope and puts it in her desk drawer. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWe DISSOLVE to a SONOGRAM. \nINT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. MORNING \nA SONOGRAM picture of a fetus. It looks to him at first like a CCTV picture blown up. COLIN stares as if at something in a horror film. \nCOLIN I was dreaming... \nMADOLYN What? \nCOLIN I was dreaming I was dead. \nMADOLYN Death is hard. Life is much easier. \nReferring to the envelope \nCOLIN What's this? \nMADOLYN Open it \nHe does. \nCOLIN Really? \nMADOLYN Yeah. \nCOLIN Really? \nMADOLYN Yeah. \nCOLIN You're joking... \nMADOLYN It's not a joke, it's a human being. \nColin belatedly thinks of what a human being might do in these circumstances and kisses her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nINT COLIN'S APARTMENT - LATER \nCOLIN is in the shower. MADOLYN moves into the     kitchen and puts the kettle on. She checks the mail, lying     there on the counter. It's tied with a string. She undoes       the string and sorts through the mail. Suddenly, she freezes      looking at: \nAN OVERSIZED ENVELOPE addressed to COLIN: [COLIN SULLIVAN, 20 Pickering Street, Apt TK, Boston, MA, zip TK], with a return address of Wm. Costigan, 13 Conant St., Boston, etc., etc.] \nMADOLYN stares at the envelope, listening to the shower going. Billy has written to her fiance. She starts to put the envelope down, and then realizes...she has to hide it...she has to open it. \nInside the envelope is a jewel case: EXILE ON MAIN STREET. And a note: PLAY ME NOW. MADOLYN puts the CD into the machine. She puts on the headset and listens...and listens. \nCOLIN comes out of the bathroom, dressed in jeans and t- shirt, barefoot, his hair wet. He looks at Madolyn, realizing that something is wrong. \nCOLIN What? \n", "test3_id": 1544}

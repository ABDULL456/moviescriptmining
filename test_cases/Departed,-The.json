{"train": "TITLE: FOUR YEARS LATER \nA test is reversed on a desk lit with fluorescents. BILLY takes up a Number Two pencil. He is in a room full of trainees, far enough along in their traineeship that their hair has grown in. \nA CLOCK TICKS, sweep hand coming around. \nBILLY'S EYES on it. \nINSTRUCTOR (O.S.) Begin. \nBILLY takes the test, marking multiple choice answers swiftly while all around him trainees are sweating and still trying to read the questions. \nEXT. A TRACK. DAY \nBILLY, wearing a State Police sweatshirt is running, alongside BROWN a black trainee with specs. \nBROWN She tells me, you never finish anything. (puff puff) You finish the police course you get taken care of again baby. (puff puff) So after graduation (puff puff) I get a blowjob again. \nBILLY That's great. Your mom must be a wonderful woman. \nBROWN Fuck yourself. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY Look at it this way, you're a black guy in Boston. You don't need any help from me to be completely fucked. \nBROWN Ways to get ahead, though, man, ways to get ahead. \nBILLY (exasperated by this) To where. (Yeah) \nBROWN is left thinking about this. \nEXT. TRAINING FIELD. DAY \nBILLY with other trainees is being braced by a DI. \nDRILL INSTRUCTOR This is not the regular police. This is the state police. Your training will illustrate the difference. What's the difference? \nBILLY (sotto voce to BROWN) Rage issues and lower median IQ. \nDRILL INSTRUCTOR You say something? \nBILLY Sir, I was agreeing with you about our obvious superiority to other forms of police, sir. \nDRILL INSTRUCTOR We're not superior, we're the best. \nBILLY Sir, yes sir. \nINT. FIRING RANGE. DAY \nBILLY, in glasses and ear-protectors, waiting for the target. Go from the GUN to \nINT. A CRACKHOUSE. DAY. \nCOLIN, four years a veteran of the gang unit, is on the job, on a raid, clearing rooms, part of a team working with massive aggression. He moves through a door. A SAD SACK OF SHIT is throwing drugs out a window. \nCOLIN (calling to other cops) Douchebag! \nCOPS enter past Colin and pigpile the man. COLIN is chewing gum, all testosterone and aggression, glad to be a cop. The smartest guy in the room. \nEXT. FIRING RANGE. DAY \nBILLY fires, and changes clips. \nEXT. A STREET IN BOSTON. DAY \nA BLACK-WINDOWED, MODERN, POLICE BUILDING, beetling over a plaza. Older Boston reflected in the featureless glass. The Boston of this film is almost futuristic. COLIN looks up at the building with great intensity. He puts on his sunglasses and walks towards the door. \nINT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY \nCOLIN, in civvies (a very good suit), stands at suave attention before CAPTAIN QUEENAN, a mild and scholarly man who might as well be a Jesuit history-teacher. \nQUEENAN Congratulations on passing the detective exam, and welcome to the Special Investigation Unit. \nDIGNAM (tonelessly) Whoop-di fuckin' do. \nQUEENAN We won't be working directly together, you'll be working for Captain Ellerby, but I like to see everybody. (contemplating him) You're a worker, you rise fast. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDIGNAM Like a twelve year old's dick. (Alt: Like a turd in the pool.) \nCOLIN Thank you, Sergeant. \nDIGNAM My pleasure. \nCOLIN (to Queenan) Thank you, sir. \nHe turns to go. \nINT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM. DAY \nAs COLIN leaves the office, looking very satisfied and not a little saturnine (it's not as if he isn't pleased by recognition and it's not as if he won't get revenge on Dignam), he barely glances--and does not actually see--the TRAINEE sitting off to one side. He sees polished brogues, and walks on. \nQUEENAN'S SECRETARY (whispering, joyful, in love with COLIN) Congratulations. \nCOLIN Thanks, hon. \nAs COLIN leaves she moderates her expression and: \nQUEENAN'S SECRETARY (coldly) You can go in there now. \nBILLY looks up. He has not seen COLIN, and COLIN has not seen him. He has his interview on his mind. \nINT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER \nBILLY stands at attention. The picture of a spit-and-polish trainee. \nQUEENAN You can sit. \nBILLY does. \nSGT. DIGNAM (CONT'D) Somebody, as you may already know, stole one hundred microprocessors from the Mass Processor Corp out Route 128. They're the kind of processors they put into computers that can put a cruise missile up the ass of a camel from the other side of the planet. That's what they do out there on \"America's Technology Highway\". Worth a hundred grand apiece. Guy worked for the company two months walked out the door with a box of processors on Tuesday, has a ticket booked for Florida on Wednesday, but on Thursday he gets found in a dumpster. You know where this dirt ball started his life? Southie projects. \nCOLIN What was his name? The, ah, departed. \nSGT. DIGNAM Myles Kennefick. Got the job with a forged UMass transcript. UMass Boston, which incidentally happens to be in... \nLAZIO South Boston? \nSGT. DIGNAM Who forged your transcript, dickhead? \nCOLIN I know that guy. His father runs the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's. \nELLERBY We are not here to solve the \"Case of the Dead Scumbag\". We are here to nail Costello. \nCOLIN stands down, embarrassed. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSGT. DIGNAM We got a guy says that   he hears Costello is moving the   processors to China...that he set   up the whole fuckin' job and popped   Kennefick. (LAZIO is writing, lawyerish.) You don't want to miss   it if Costello takes a dump. \nELLERBY We'd miss less if your informants were available to us, and of course to the FBI (Bureau)... \nLAZIO Without asking for details, do you have anyone in with Costello presently? \nSGT. DIGNAM Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself. My theory on Feds is they're like mushrooms. Feed 'em shit and keep in the dark. You girls have a nice day. \nEXT. A STREET OF TENEMENTS IN SOUTHIE. DAY \nBILLY steps off a bus at a corner. He goes up to a house, and knocks on the door. A Southie hag answers. On an oxygen cylinder, smoking. \nBILLY'S AUNT Billy? \nBILLY nods. \nBILLY Aunt Cathy? \nHis aunt takes her cigarette out of her mouth and then embraces him fiercely. BILLY takes it like the imposter he is. But he might well love his aunt. \nBILLY'S AUNT Good to see you. Good to see you. \nINT. BILLY'S AUNT'S KITCHEN. DAY \nBILLY is eating soup. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY'S AUNT They said you were in the Staties, I couldn't believe it. \nBILLY I got kicked out about four months ago. \nSEAN It was in the papers. \nSean is a villain leaning in a doorway. Bad tie: he takes it off. He has been at a funeral. \nBILLY Well. So you know. \nSEAN And why are we graced with your presence? \nBILLY I brought your mother some pictures of my father. \nIt's true. They are on the table. \nBILLY (CONT'D) My mother had them. My mother's dead. \nSEAN (reflexively) I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your troubles. \nSean opens the fridge, opens a beer, and hands it to BILLY. He opens one for himself. \nSEAN (CONT'D) I was at a funeral myself. Myles Kennefick, knew him in school. Beat the fuck out of him seven or eight times as a matter of fact. (affably to Billy) You workin'? \nBILLY No. \nEXT. THE PORCH OF THE THREE-DECKER. LATER \nSean and BILLY are still drinking beer. \nSEAN When did I see you after that? \nBILLY Not for a long time. Down the cape after Rose's wedding. I think. \nSEAN Fuck, oh shit. I remember that, dude. I had that fuckin' buck knife, right, and I cut all the brass numbas off the doors at the hotel. I was trippin'...All of them. That was a night. \nSean looks deflated. \nBILLY Listen, I got twenty thousand dollars when my mother died. Insurance. \nSEAN Yeah? \nBILLY In your line of work, if I gave you ten thousand dollars what could you give me back? \nSEAN My line of work... I'm not in that line of work just presently because I don't have ten thousand dollars. As a matter of fact I have never had ten thousand dollars. \nBILLY That's what I'm saying. \nSean nods, and nods. \nSEAN You know what we usually say at these moments. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY You fuckin' moron. What are you talking about? I'm not a cop. I'm your cousin. \nINT. BILLY'S CAR. NIGHT \nBILLY is waiting. Sean comes out of a squalid looking house and gets into a car. Fast. Billy puts the car in gear. \nSEAN Fuckin' Ricans think they know everything. If they knew shit they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans. \nHe has a paper bag full of money. He opens a beer. \nMRS KENNEFICK I mean fuck yourself. \nShe slams the door. As COLIN walks away from the door he notices the TAIL: a maroon sedan and a damaged white delivery van. \nCOLIN You get that? \nBARRIGAN \"Allegedly\" or \"fuck yourself?\" \nCOLIN Welcome to the neighborhood. \nEXT. AN INTERSECTION. MOMENTS LATER \nFRENCH pulls up to a light. \n[COSTELLO blows a red light and leaves the tail (including the Surveillance Van which we will see again) behind him in a snarl of traffic.] \nCOSTELLO Cut 'em here. \nFrench steps on it and blows through the light, leaving the follow cars behind. \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) Bye, bye. \nINT. THE ELEVATOR AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS. DAY \nCOLIN boards with a bunch of other cops and workers. On board, directly beside him, is MADOLYN. COLIN's age, beautiful, wearing a business suit. She has a thick stack of medical-looking files. She's a psychiatrist on contract to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She does probation counselling work with \"violent offenders\" and also sees policemen. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOLIN Making a house call? \nMADOLYN Have I seen you professionally? \nCOLIN No, no. I know what you do. I know who you are. \nMADOLYN nods, and then because this is a (relatively) sensitive subject ignores COLIN, but she is visibly attracted by him. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) When guys have to \"use their \"service revolvers\" in the \"course of duty\" they get to talk to you about their \"feelings\" and whatnot. \nMADOLYN laughs. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) No. Oh, I know how it goes. You're a mental health professional. \nMADOLYN (laughing) I have an appointment on this floor. \nThe door opens. \nCOLIN That's good. They're all fuckin' crazy on that floor. (points up) I'm one floor up. \nMADOLYN Oh, fancy policeman. \nCOLIN That's right. Fancy. \nMADOLYN Are you a Statie? \nAfter she steps out he prevents the door from closing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCOLIN Yeah, I'm also getting my law degree. \nMADOLYN Suffolk, nights? \nCOLIN They don't run Harvard Law at night, last time I checked. \nMADOLYN When was the last time you checked? \nCOLIN Before I went to fucking Suffolk. \nMADOLYN I went to U Mass. I wasn't insulting you. \nCOLIN Well I thought you were, and for that you have to take me to dinner. \nMADOLYN Maybe you could shoot someone and I'd have to see you professionally. \nCOLIN Whatever it takes. I'll stab someone in the heart with an icepick right now if it gets me dinner with you. \nMADOLYN hands him a card. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) I don't need a card, I'm a detective. \nShe hesitates. He takes the card. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) I'm only joking. Nice to meet you... \"Madolyn\". \nThe doors close. The elevator takes him up. He takes out his cellphone as if he's forgotten something. As the doors open, the signal bars light up, and the phone rings. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nCOLIN (CONT'D) (walking, voice low) I didn't know about your tail until I saw it myself. I couldn't call, I had the other guy with me. Blue sedan and a white delivery van, fucked up with graffiti on the side. The van is audio surveillance. OK, have a nice day. \nINT. A COFFEE SHOP IN SOUTHIE. MORNING \nThe same shop in which YOUNG COSTELLO talked to YOUNG COLIN, all those years ago. Two ITALIANS are in the shop, talking hard to the Pakistani PROPRIETOR (SINGH). These are hard guys but they're not being threatening, just persistent: the guy DOES owe them money. BILLY is finishing his breakfast. Watching. He goes over. The two GUINEAS are amazed. [Dialog on separate document]. \nBilly is finishing his breakfast. Watching. He goes over.... \nBILLY You guys from Providence? \nThe GUINEAS look at him. The younger one moves to intervene. BILLY smiles and destroys them both. Maniacal violence. The biggest beatdown in gangster movie history--and obviously that's saying something. In the course of the beat-down Billy breaks his left hand--a \"boxer's fracture\". BILLY stands over his victims, breathing hard, holding his broken hand. \nPROPRIETOR What have you done to my place! Get out of here. \nBILLY goes. \nINT. EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT \nBILLY, unlit cigarette in his mouth, is having his hand wrapped in plaster by a lady doctor. In another life he might have dated her. Not in this one. \nINT. FRENCH RESTAURANT. NIGHT \nCOSTELLO No. (a beat) Come with me. (As BILLY hesitates) I'm not the cops. I'm not askin' you. \nBILLY stands up. MISTER FRENCH stands up. BILLY, COSTELLO, and MISTER FRENCH move towards the back room. As they walk to the back room of the bar, we hear COSTELLO: \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) You know something, they just do not stop having the Mafia in Providence, and this can cause problems for me. \nINT. BACK ROOM OF THE BAR. CONTINUOUS. \nCOSTELLO Those guys you tuned up are connected down Providence. What they're going to do is come back up with some guys and kill you. Which, sure as you're born, they will do unless I stop them. Do you want me to stop them? \nBILLY Is it something I can't do personally? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOSTELLO appreciates the balls of this. He looks at Mister French. Then back at Billy, smiling. \nCOSTELLO I'm going to have my associate search you. \nBILLY tenses. Exactly as he might if he were wearing a wire. \nBILLY Search me? Search me for what? \nMISTER FRENCH and COSTELLO look at each other. \nMISTER FRENCH C'm here. \nCOSTELLO Contra-fucking-band.    Take your fuckin' shoes off. \nMISTER FRENCH Shoes off. \nBILLY slips out of them. MISTER FRENCH inspects the shoes. COSTELLO'S cold eyes are on BILLY. MISTER FRENCH searches BILLY. Looks into his wallet. The wallet is emptied onto a table. \nCOSTELLO I knew your father. \nBILLY Yeah. He's dead. \nCOSTELLO I'm sorry.     How did he go? \nBILLY He didn't complain. \nCOSTELLO That was his problem. \nBILLY Who said he had a fuckin' problem. \nCOSTELLO I just said he had a fuckin' problem. There's a man could have been anything. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBILLY Are you saying he was nothing? \nCOSTELLO I'm saying he worked at the airport. \nCOSTELLO turns to MISTER FRENCH. \nMISTER FRENCH He's clean. \nCOSTELLO The arm. \nWith amazing violence MISTER FRENCH smashes the cast on the corner of a table. Billy drops to his knees in tears of pain. MISTER FRENCH sorts through the pieces of the cast. Ad libs: \"such a fuckin' pussy.\" \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) (holding Billy by the collar) It makes me curious to see you in this neighborhood. Regressing. And, if I can slander my own formative environment, it makes me sad, this regressing. Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some cop prick like fucking Queenan to pull you out of the Staties, and send you after me. I just can't know. I don't know what they do in...that department, anyway. \nHe grabs Billy's broken right hand. \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) Are you still a cop? \nBILLY No. \nCOSTELLO twists Billy's broken hand. \nCOSTELLO You swear on your mother's grave that you're not a cop. \nBILLY I am not a cop. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nCOSTELLO You stop doing coke deals with your jerk-off cousin? \nBILLY Yes! \nCOSTELLO lets go of Billy's hand. Billy is weeping on the floor. COSTELLO straightens his suit. \nCOSTELLO Take it easy. Get your hand taken care of. I'm sorry. It was necessary. As for our problem with Providence...let's not cry over spilled guineas. \nINT. THE MAIN PART OF THE BAR. MOMENTS LATER \nCOSTELLO, the visiting king, points at a group of drinkers, including a BLOND WOMAN (1st), GWEN. \nCOSTELLO What's this IRA motherfucker doing in my bar? \nThe IRA MOTHERFUCKER is terrified. \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) (slapping him on the back) Only kidding. How's your mother? \nJIMMY Ah, she's on her way out. \nCOSTELLO We all are. (straightens suit and tie) Act accordingly. \nCostello exits. \nINT. COSTELLO'S APARTMENT. NIGHT \nMISTER FRENCH is methodically shelling and eating peanuts. \nCOSTELLO Do you trust him? \nMISTER FRENCH These days, who's reliable? \n(CONTINUED) \nThe wire falls into the water. \nINT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE. CONTINUOUS. \nQueenan reacts mildly to the loss of the signal. He removes his headphones. \nDIGNAM That was quick. He dead already? \nEXT. \"ACROPOLIS RESTAURANT\". DAY \nA GREEK GUY (JIMMY PAPPAS) in chef's whites is cuffed and stuffed by TACTICAL OFFICERS. He has no idea what is going on. COLIN and BARRIGAN follow. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOLIN This will get Captain Ellerby on the six o'clock news. \nBARRIGAN No wonder you get ahead. \nEXT. A STREET BY THE HARBOR. DAY \nBILLY walking and talking on the phone. \nBILLY I won't do it if I have to wear a wire. No wires. Ever, ever, you understand me? You don't know what this is like. (listens) Micro what? \nINT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nQueenan on the phone. \nQUEENAN Microprocessors. We'll probably be at war with the Chinese in twenty- odd years and Costello is selling them military technology. Microprocessors, chips, computer parts. Anybody says anything about anything like that, you let us know. \nEXT. POLICE BUILDING. DAY. TELEVISION IMAGE. \nELLERBY is before a thicket of microphones. \nREPORTER Did you have a tip from an informant? \nELLERBY No, it was tireless police activity that ah effected ah the arrest of the ah alleged perpetrator. \nINT. COLIN'S OFFICE #1. DAY \nCOLIN is rolling a quarter across the backs of his fingers. BROWN (last seen as Billy's friend) and BARRIGAN, new plainclothes recruits to Colin's special squad, sit across from him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOLIN I've been put in charge of this unit. It is a small surveillance sub-unit but it is mine. And I didn't take this job in order to fuck it up, or to let anyone else fuck it up, whosoever they may be. I hand picked this group. You are my A-team so I want you to conduct yourselves accordingly. \nThrough glass we see ELLERBY, preening. ELLERBY gives the thumbs up. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) Hi, Captain. And our primary target is obviously Frank Costello. But we don't communicate with anyone else in this shop. Queenan is compartmentalizing everything in SIU. It's the right thing to do, personally I don't trust these fucking troopers either. We think we might have a problem. We think Costello's got a rat in the State Police. \nBROWN Really? \nCOLIN Yeah.   Really. \nBROWN Do we have direct access to Queenan's undercovers? \nCOLIN (not happy about this) No. Ah...not presently. Not presently. But I'm hoping to get things...reorganized. That's it. Congratulations. Don't disappoint me. \nBROWN and BARRIGAN leave.       Colin leaves as well. \nBARRIGAN (to Brown) I know why I'm here. I made him feel guilty. Why are you here? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBROWN Intelligence and aptitude. \nBARRIGAN That's new. \nCOLIN opens his cell phone. \nCOLIN Hello Dad. I have a new job. (ALT: I got a promotion.) \nINT. A BOOKIE SHOP. DAY \nMISTER FRENCH backhands a guy into a table of betting slips. \nMISTER FRENCH Where's your fucking license? I don't see no fucking license. \nBOOKIE What license. \nBILLY, who is not wearing a cast anymore, watches. \nMISTER FRENCH There's no such thing as a license, of course, but you definitely have to have one. (grabs the bookie by the ear) If you are not being run by us you will be run by someone else, which means you will have let undesirable elements into Mr. Costello's area. \nA HARD GUY sitting reaches inside his coat. BILLY in a flash breaks his jaw with a pistol barrel and then covers the sprawled HARD GUY with the gun. \nHARD GUY (spitting teeth) I was going for my fucking cigarettes... \nHe was. They fall from his fingers. \nMISTER FRENCH Hey, that's Jimmy Bags. What the fuck you doin'? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY What the fuck. I didn't know.... \nBOOKIE There's no profit if I pay him two grand a week. I'm in the hole if I pay him two grand a week. \nMISTER FRENCH Then make more money or go out of business. This is America. If you don't make money you're a fucking douchebag. What are you going to do? \nBOOKIE Make more money. \nMISTER FRENCH That's the spirit. \nEXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE BOOKIE SHOP. LATER \nBILLY and MISTER FRENCH emerge. \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) How is Sister Mary Theresa doing? We had a tasty relationship before she took her vows. Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers. \nINT. BASEMENT - NIGHT \nFITZY beats up a guy with a pipe.   Billy watches from the background. \nEXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT \nFITZY and the Costello gang blow up a car as Billy watches. Laughing, they hop in their vehicles and drive off. \nINT. ELLERBY'S OFFICE. MORNING \nOFFICE decorated with golf implements. ELLERBY has a hangover. Sunglasses. Eating baby aspirin by the small fistful. \nCOLIN I'm not making enough progress with Costello? \nELLERBY \"Progress\" is hard to define. I make progress every day. In fact, I'm making progress now. There are guys in this department make excellent progress for twenty years without ever getting anything you could definitively call a result. It's like any American industry. Nobody minds if you don't succeed as long as you don't fuck up. \nHe has a bowl of ice water on his desk. \nELLERBY (CONT'D) Objectives get lost sight of: fair enough. Who did the two guys from Providence? \nCOLIN Jimmy Pappas. \nELLERBY And what happened to Jimmy Pappas? \nCOLIN He had a heart attack in jail and got knifed in his bed at Boston City Hospital. I believe it's been in the papers. \nELLERBY stares at COLIN. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nELLERBY Are you happy with this result? \nCOLIN It's a result. \nELLERBY Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits. \nCOLIN Cui gives a shit. It's got a bow on it. \nELLERBY (with true appreciation) I think you are a cop, my son. \nHe drops his face into the bowl of ice water. \nINT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT. MORNING \nA stripped HOSPITAL BED stands in a fall of light. This is the apartment where his mother became ill. Billy has packed half of his mother's things into boxes--and then stopped. Billy doesn't use the bedroom. He sleeps on the couch among boxes of pictures, papers, teacups wrapped in newspaper. BILLY is sitting on the couch. He reaches into a box and lays out photographs like cards. Scenes from his life. His former life. His family life, his life as a child, his romantic life. He sits and stares at the pictures. He rearranges the photographs in different ways. \nNOTE: THIS IS A MEMORY BILLY HAS AS HE IS LOOKING AT PHOTOGRAPHS ON HIS MOTHER'S APARTMENT. \nFRENCH and BILLY break in, surprising the MAN (BRIAN), seated at his dining room table. He throws a child's toy at them. FRENCH ducks out of the way and the toy hits BILLY in the cheek. \nFRENCH draws his pistol and approaches the table. BRIAN rises and starts to flee. Cut off, he retreats the other way. \nBRIAN No, please... \nFRENCH Brian, stop it, I ain't gonna hurt you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe fires, using a soda bottle as a silencer. BRIAN drops to the floor. FRENCH approaches him assessing his victim. \nHe turns to leave, passing BILLY.     He give him a slap. \nFRENCH (CONT'D) Wake the fuck up. \nThey leave. \nEXT. A BEACH NEAR A POWERPLANT. DAY \nBILLY leans against the wall of a concession stand. His knuckles are cut. A cut over his eye. He is agitated. Smoking. A car pulls up and Queenan and Dignam get out of it. In appearance, if anybody's watching, they're bracing Billy. \nQUEENAN Hey.   Let's go through the routine. \nDIGNAM You think you can pop someone. There's no special card to play. The guy whose jaw you broke was Boston Police Department. \nBILLY I'm going fuckin' nuts. I can't be someone else every day. \nDIGNAM Most of the people in the world do it every day. What's the big deal? \nDignam is drinking coffee. \nBILLY I'm not them. \nDIGNAM You're nobody. You signed the paper. We're the only people in the world who know that you're a cop. Maybe we'll just erase your file. \nThis is Billy's deepest fear. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDIGNAM (CONT'D) And zip, you're a soldier for Costello, open to arrest for how many felonies? Maybe we'll do that. \nBILLY Maybe I'll fucking kill you. \nHe gets free of DIGNAM and punches him. \nQUEENAN Easy now.    That was a joke, Billy. \nDIGNAM Just because you play a fucking tough guy doesn't mean you are one, you lace curtain fucking pussy. \nThe fight. QUEENAN grabs Billy and holds him against the wall. \nQUEENAN (gently, like a man calming a wild animal) Be smart. If someone was watching how are we supposed to not arrest you? \nBILLY looks desperately inland. \nREVERE BEACH condominium buildings. A thousand empty terraces, five thousand empty windows. BILLY is desperate. \nQUEENAN (CONT'D) Get in the car. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CONTINUOUS. \nFITZY closes the cellphone. He puts it into COLIN'S hand. \nINT. A HOUSE WHERE DRUGS ARE BEING HANDLED. CONTINUOUS \nMISTER FRENCH Everybody out. Move. \nThe DRUGS are swept up instantly, in sheets laid over the tables. MISTER FRENCH lights a cigarette with his ZIPPO, and then reaches out and lights the curtains on fire as BILLY watches. \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CONTINUOUS. \nCOLIN takes the cellphone and puts it in his pocket. \nFITZY Who are you? When do I get out of here? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOLIN I think you need another attorney, after all, Mr. Fitzgibbon. Have a nice day. \nINT. OBSERVATION OFFICE.CONTINUOUS \nCOLIN comes out and hands BROWN the CELLPHONE. \nCOLIN Run the last number called. That'll be his house. Whatever the location is I'll swear I surveilled him at it. Abracafuckindabra. \nBROWN Why'd you use my phone? \nCOLIN Because you didn't go in there. \nINT. COLIN'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCOLIN, hung-over, sits at the breakfast table.     Madolyn looks at him. \nMADOLYN The light's nice here in the morning. \nCOLIN doesn't respond. \nMADOLYN (CONT'D) It's all right. Guys tend to make a big deal out of it. It's actually quite common. \nCOLIN I gotta go to work. \nCOLIN simply gets up and walks away. \nINT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE. DAY \nA clock ticking. Madolyn is looking across at ...Billy. Madolyn is very much a guarded shrink. But no one's more guarded than Billy. \nBILLY It's like confession. Isn't it. This sort of thing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA beat. \nBILLY (CONT'D) People make things up in confession. You know that? \nMADOLYN I know they do. \nBILLY People are liars. They want to be stars of their little films. \nMADOLYN That's an interesting observation. \nBILLY Do you lie? \nMADOLYN Why do you? \nBILLY I'm asking if you lie. \nMADOLYN Honesty isn't synonymous with truth. \nBILLY You lie. So, is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally, or just for the fuck of it? \nMADOLYN I expect sometimes...people...do it to keep things...on an even keel. \nBILLY So, you had a parent who was a drunk? \nMADOLYN looks up at him, transpierced. Tables turned on the psychiatrist. BILLY smiles at her. \nMADOLYN (flustered) Did you? \nBILLY (simply) No. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMADOLYN Let's keep this with you. \nBILLY (abruptly) There was a cop leaving when I came in. \nMADOLYN How do you know he was a cop? \nBILLY Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight air of scumbag entitlement. You see cops? \nMADOLYN That's part of what I do. Although, I don't normally see cadets who were kicked out of the Academy. \nBILLY You should get a better job... \nBILLY (CONT'D) Do they all come in and cry...your cops? \nMADOLYN Sometimes they cry if they had trouble at home or if they've had to...use their weapons. \nBILLY Let me tell you something. They signed up to use their fuckin' weapons. Most of them. But they watch enough TV so they know they have to \"weep\" after they use their weapons. No one's more full of shit than a cop. Except a cop on TV. \nMADOLYN I looked through your file and I see you have a record of assault. What was it like for you in jail? \nBILLY You want to hear about the showers? \nMADOLYN Did something happen to you? \n(CONTINUED) \nELLERBY (CONT'D) We've been after this son of a bitch for a long time, and we're getting him tonight. Get to work. \nCOLIN (to team) Go find out what we're doing and get on it. \nCOLIN wanders off in the mill of officers. He is taking out his cell phone when ELLERBY comes up to him. \nELLERBY Sorry to get you at the last minute. But things leak. This lead came from Queenan's undercover guy. \nELLERBY walks on to a COFFEE STATION, a yard away. \nCOLIN (into cell) Dad? \nCOSTELLO (O.S.) (on phone) Yes? \nCOLIN is completely normal on the phone. \nCOLIN I'm not going to make dinner. Something big has come up. \nINT. COSTELLO'S APARMENT. CONTINUOUS \nCOSTELLO is on the phone. \nCOSTELLO Too bad. Your mother worked all goddamned day. We'll just have to sit down without you and your friends. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS \nCOLIN turns away from the activity. \nCOLIN Oh, my friends are still coming. \nCOLIN sees QUEENAN staring at him. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) We'll just say lunch tomorrow.   All right, bye. \nCOLIN ends the call. QUEENAN is there. \nQUEENAN The readiness is all. You know the players, call the game. \nCOLIN Thank you, Captain. \nHe gives him the clipboard, Colin goes to the work area. \nLATER \nCOLIN joins his team (BROWN AND BARRIGAN), who are seated in a U shaped work-area. COLIN, still stunned by the fact of this operations center, swallows as he notices on video three angles of a building he seems to know very well. He sits down and puts a headset on. A GEEK COP leans over and shakes his hand. \nGEEK COP Piece of cake. I'll operate the cameras. You ID the guys and log them. \nCOLIN nods. QUEENAN comes up. \nQUEENAN All cellphone signals are under surveillance through the courtesy of our Federal friends over there... \nCOLIN looks: sees LAZIO and two others. \nELLERBY (as if on coke and he probably is) Patriot Act. Love it. Love it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOLIN, using his left hand, not looking, opens his cellphone, autodials, and then taps an instant message into it, pushes \"Send.\" \nDETAIL OF IM: \"No Phones\" \nONSCREEN, CARS PULL UP IN FRONT OF THE TARGET BUILDING. \nCOLIN All right. That's Costello right there. Costello, Mister French, Fitzy, Delahunt, Billy Costigan the new guy...Time is 10.46. \nBROWN Who are they meeting? \nELLERBY (leaning over screens) I don't know. Some Chinamen from points unknown. They're already inside. \nDETAIL OF COLIN'S PHONE. COLIN hits \"send\", sending the message \"No phones\". THE SCREEN then reads \"Erasing Sent Message\". \nEXT. TARGET BUILDING. NIGHT \nCOSTELLO and the boys go into the building, moving past TWO IDLING CARS. We see Costello look casually at his phone. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS \nWatching images. COSTELLO'S GUYS move through pillars and disappear. \nCAMERA GEEK COP We have a blind spot. \nELLERBY Why do you have a blind spot? \nCAMERA GEEK COP We had two hour's notice. Two hours. What the fuck you think this is, NASA? \nELLERBY It never crossed my mind. You get a camera in the back? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTECH COP IN DOWN VEST What back? \nEllerby blows his nose. He is on coke. COLIN sends another TEXT MESSAGE: \"Blind spot inside door.\" \nINT. TARGET BUILDING. CONTINUOUS - REVISED 6/8-9/05 \nCOSTELLO looks at his IM screen and turns to his guys. \nCOSTELLO Turn off your cell phones. \nFITZY and some others mutter. \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) Check your weapons...Fitzy has the chicken... \nEveryone turns off their phones, including BILLY (but we know Billy has TWO phones). \nBILLY looks around at the pillared distances. He sees: \nA GROUP OF THREE MEN waiting and FIVE OTHER MEN spreading out through the pillars. Armed. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS \nCHINESE GANGSTER Du ne. [Fuck you.] \nThe deal is done. \nCOSTELLO The expedition continues this way. \nTo Billy's surprise both Costello's men and the Chinese head out through the back industrial windows onto a canal-side pier. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS \nThe CARS of the CHINESE GUYS are driven away, passing a van full of... \nStartled TACTICAL COPS. TWO TACTICAL UNITS are hidden outside. \nINT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS \nELLERBY is staring at the screens. \nELLERBY Don't tell me those cars were empty. Please don't tell me those Chinamen's cars were empty. (to Camera Tech Cop) Do you have a camera in the back. \nAn IMAGE comes up. Nothing. \nELLERBY (CONT'D) Can I talk to you a minute? \nAs the Camera Technician gets up, Ellerby pounces on him. \nEXT. BEHIND THE BUILDING. CONTINUOUS \nTied to the pier there are two boats, a NOVI LOBSTER BOAT and a BOSTON WHALER with a guys we've never seen at the wheel (random getaway hires). The TRIAD members get into the NOVI, and chug away. Fitzy carries the SUITCASES OF MONEY onto a BOSTON WHALER and it takes off. COSTELLO turns to Billy. \nCOSTELLO See, no surveillance here. They didn't figure we had a navy. Always figure an exit for your business partners. What with everything all dug up, you can't trust a slant to find the Mass Pike and, with or without Staties out front, frankly I don't approve of orientals driving to begin with. \nBILLY What about us, Frank?   What're we gonna do? \nCOSTELLO We depart. We didn't commit no illegalities. \nBILLY is stunned. Admiring. \nMISTER FRENCH Except sell the ching chongs a bunch of fuckin' plastic. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe CHINESE GUYS, staring back, chug away down the canal in the lobster boat. BILLY watches COSTELLO go, admiringly, and then follows him. \nEXT. STREET NEAR TARGET BUILDING - NIGHT          103A \nA few blocks from the target building, a Police Tactical unit stops the departing Triad cars with a roadblock. As officers approach the cars they realize they are empty except for hired Caucasian drivers. An officer reports this to the command center. \nINT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. DAY \nColin is asleep on the couch, in a bachelor disaster of Chinese food boxes. Something on TV: \"Audition.\" A key in the door: He wakes as MADOLYN comes in carrying a bag of coffees and a BOX OF EFFECTS. \nMADOLYN Good Morning. \nMADOLYN smiles at him, also shy. \nCOLIN Good morning. \nMADOLYN I beat the movers. \nCOLIN How was the last night in the, ah, old establishment? \nMADOLYN (putting the box on the kitchen counter) Lonely. \nCOLIN I'm glad to hear that.   It sucked here, too. \nThey kiss.    MADOLYN takes in the apartment. \nMADOLYN I'm gonna thank your Uncle Alphonsus for the square footage. \nCOLIN Uncle Alphonsus is in heaven.   So am I. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMADOLYN unpacks food.       Coffee.   Croissants. \nMADOLYN French donut? \nCOLIN (re: box of stuff) Yeah. Hey, can I... \nMADOLYN Sure yeah. \nHe sorts through the box. It's all Madolyn's key stuff - a mug, a few critical books...framed family pictures, breakables...and comes up with: A PHOTOGRAPH of a young Madolyn standing in front of a North East rust belt slum. \nCOLIN Well, we're not having this out. \nMADOLYN What? \nMADOLYN isn't prepared to be at cross-purposes. But she is taken aback. She puts the photo quietly away. Contaminated. \nCOLIN You don't see any pictures of where I came from. Look, I respect who you are, but not in the living room. We might have company. \nMADOLYN Company? \nShe laughs.    COLIN looks at a diploma.     Veritas. \nCOLIN Why work for the state? \nMADOLYN Why not?   You do. \nCOLIN Not forever, and you don't have to. You've got degrees...you're a hot shit... I mean, what you do, why make as much as a guidance counselor? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMADOLYN (deadpan, over her coffee cup) I believe in public service. \nCOLIN stares at her. \nCOLIN Now you're just being ridiculous. \nDIGNAM I can't wait to wipe that fuckin' smirk off your face. \nCOSTELLO (to Dignam) Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me? \nQUEENAN I will get you, Frank. \nCOSTELLO If you could've you would've but I guess you like to go at your own pace. \nFrom off-stage we hear a young, angelic GIRLS CHOIR begin to sing. \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) Excuse me, I've got a date with some angels. \nAs Costello walks away: \nQUEENAN Sooner than you think, Francis. \nINT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS \nCOLIN, looking worried, folding his phone away, comes into the apartment. MADOLYN is staring at him. \nCOLIN What? \nMADOLYN You have a boss that has a laryngectomy? \nCOLIN No, no, no. That was a guy who works for me. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMADOLYN You're lying to me. \nCOLIN Not exactly. (the charming Colin:) There are certain things I will not be able to talk to you about. I cannot allow you to jeopardize an ongoing investigation. (Or your own life.) (more seriously, after a long beat) There really are things connected to my job that you can't ask about. That you don't want to know about. \nMADOLYN (after a beat) Okay, then say that. \nCOLIN looks at her steadily:         if she's serious, she's pure gold. \nCOLIN I will.    Thank you. \nHe kisses her.       The DOORBELL RINGS. \nMADOLYN That's the movers. \nCOLIN You still wanna stay? \nMADOLYN I do. \nThe doorbell safely ringing, Colin kisses Madolyn. \nCOLIN (re: doorbell) All right. All right.       I'm coming. \nINT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. CONTINUOUS \nDIGNAM is alone. We see Queenan's empty desk in a fall of light. We see Dignam's arm, wrist, phone, an expensive heavy watch. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY (O.S.) I'm gonna get on a plane unless you put Queenan on the phone. \nDIGNAM Queenan had a funeral to go to. This is my shift. Calm down. \nINT. IM PEI TYPE FOOTBRIDGE WITH A PEDESTRIAN CONVEYOR. DAY (INTERCUT) \nBILLY is talking on the phone, in a fury. \nBILLY Why shouldn't I get on a fucking plane? Meet up? Do you actually want me dead? There's a rat in your unit. That's a fact. You just don't know it. Where's Queenan? \nDIGNAM He's not here. \nBILLY They knew you had cameras in the building. You have a leak from the inside. It's real. Smoke him out. \nDIGNAM And how do we do that Mr... fucking genius who didn't even graduate the academy? \nBILLY Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you're getting a sealed wiretap warrant for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our department but tell SIU. Flush it and see if it comes out of the pipe on my end. That's first. Narrow it down. Where's Queenan. \nDIGNAM Are you deaf? He's not here. Call me when you get something real. \nBILLY is in a full-on panic attack. He takes a pill, leans back against a wall, closes his eyes. The second phone rings. He stares at it: opens it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY It's me. \nINT. DESERTED CAFE -     DAY \nMadolyn and Billy sit at a table. Talking like friends now, emphatically non-clinical. Billy is zoned out, preoccupied, nervous. \nMADOLYN I'm assuming you want to change things, you know, change the people you know, change the people you meet, change everything, anything. Too many choices can see like no choice at all... \nBILLY Confucius say that? \nMADOLYN So you do...something radical. \nBILLY \"Something radical,\" huh? \nMADOLYN ...yeah, you do... Sometimes it's just a matter of picking a thing and doing it... \nBILLY So how long you been with this guy? \nMADOLYN Oh, four months. About four months. \nBILLY You love this guy? \nMADOLYN It's pretty serious, yeah, it is. \nBILLY A head case or anything?    I'm just curious... \nMADOLYN No more than I am. \n(CONTINUED) \nINT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER \nBILLY sits on a bench in a hallway, exhausted, staring. THE SACRED HEART and JFK are on the walls. QUEENAN comes along the hall. \nQUEENAN My wife's asleep. She left supper out. Come and have something to eat. \nBILLY shakes his head. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY No, I... \nQUEENAN We'll talk in the kitchen. Come and have something to eat. \nBILLY follows him towards the lighted kitchen door. \nEXT. DRIVING RANGE. DAY (WINDY) \nCOLIN is watching ELLERBY hit golf balls. Well. \nELLERBY Congratulations. Haven't seen a guy like you since me. You'll be transferred to Internal Investigations but you will continue to work right where you are in the Special Investigation Unit. \nCOLIN I don't get it. \nELLERBY We are all convinced that Costello has at least one mole in the Special Investigation Unit. \nCOLIN Right. \nELLERBY You'll investigate. Everybody. Anybody. \nCOLIN Well, that's just a dream job for a cop. \nELLERBY We have considered all possible candidates. You have an immaculate record. Some people never trust a guy with an immaculate record. I do. (a beat) I have an immaculate record. \nELLERBY hits a drive. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nELLERBY (CONT'D) Play golf? \nCOLIN No. \nELLERBY That's a pity. Pretty much sucks as a game but you get to form relationships. (a beat) How's the wedding coming along? \nCOLIN Everything's great. On schedule. She's a doctor. \nELLERBY Outstanding. That's good. Marriage is an important part of getting ahead. You don't want anyone thinking you're a homo. Married guy seems stable. People look at a wedding ring and think: someone can stand the son of a bitch. Ladies see the wedding ring and know immediately that you must have some cash and that your cock works. \nCOLIN Oh, it's working. Overtime. \nELLERBY I'm glad to hear that. \nHits a drive. Ponk. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION AREA. DAY \nHEAVY EQUIPMENT stands on the thrashed earth. Hoardings. BILLY crosses the road under what remains of the Expressway, and after hiding in an angle of the building and cocking the gun in his pocket bangs on the door of a dead bar. The door is unlocked by: DELAHUNT. \nINT. THE DEAD BAR. DAY \nIt's another of COSTELLO'S \"locations\". BILLY looks around. Every man from the previous night is there--but no COSTELLO. DELAHUNT closes the door behind him and bars it. Men are oddly enough filling out forms. These are not men used to pencil and paper. Billy is nodded at. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMISTER FRENCH Boss wants your real name, your social, your license number, all your bank account numbers. \nBILLY I don't have a bank account. \nMISTER FRENCH I'm a cash business myself. \nBILLY What's he doing, setting up IRAs? \nMISTER FRENCH You fill in the papers, real name, all your numbers, no fucking around, and then we all wait here. \nMISTER FRENCH (CONT'D) No, I ain't. \nMISTER FRENCH goes off into a separate room. BILLY takes a paper and, sitting at the bar beside FITZY, writes down his information. The other men are mostly finished and DELAHUNT is collecting the papers. DELAHUNT tosses the brown envelope on the bar. \nDELAHUNT Put the forms in there. \nFITZY I don't know if this is how you spell Citizens'. \nBILLY glances at what FITZY is crawling: CITTIZINS TRUST. \nBILLY No, no, no. Jesus Christ. \nHe takes the brown envelope, and writes on it CITIZENS. \nFITZY What are you, retarded? That ain't right. \nBILLY gives up. Both of their forms are stuffed in an envelope. BILLY gets up. \nDELAHUNT Billy, he said to stay here. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBILLY I'm not sitting in this room without a tetanus shot. I'm not staying. \nMISTER FRENCH Where you going? \nBILLY goes out. DELAHUNT puts his coat on. He picks up the brown envelope on which CITIZENS TRUST is written. \nEXT. THE WATERFRONT. DAY \nBILLY is holding his bottle of tranqs. He traces with his finger the doctor's name...MADOLYN MADDEN. His \"police\" phone vibrates and he takes it out. \nONSCREEN Follow the envelope. \nANOTHER STREET painted with neon light (quiet). \nBILLY'S POV: \nCOLIN is halfway down the street. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY follows. \nBILLY is nearly up to COLIN on this quieter street \n(And COLIN is aware of the tail) \nwhen... \nBILLY'S cellphone rings. His phone has fucked up, as they do. Instead of turning around, COLIN accelerates. The only thing on his agenda is to not have his face seen. \nBILLY spins into a door-opening and silences the ringer. \nTEXT MESSAGE DETAIL Make arrest. \nCOLIN takes a right at the end of the street, into an alley. \nEXT. AROUND THE NEXT CORNER. MOMENTS LATER \nCOLIN is waiting, in a doorway of his own. He has a knife open in his hand. He waits, listening to (faltering) footsteps: a MAN, face invisible in shadow, turns the corner. COLIN pulls him into the doorway and rips upwards with a knife. \nAs the body falls we see: it isn't Billy. It's a CHINESE MAN. COLIN backs away in horror, and hurries off down the street. \nEXT. ANOTHER STREET. MOMENTS LATER \nCOLIN, sweating, staggering, hurries along. No sign of Billy, no sign of a follower. But he does notice: CCTV cameras at the intersection. He spins and gets out of there, heading off through. CHINATOWN. Colin, holding his envelope, walks, sweating, fast, then faster, past repeated ideograms in neon (the ideograms say--flash--\"Departed\"). \nEXT. CHINATOWN. MOMENTS LATER \nBILLY has lost Colin. He hears a hubbub from the corner where a small crowd of Chinese speakers is gathering and pushes through the crowd to see: blood running on the pavement. BILLY backs away, gets out of there. \nINT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT \nCOLIN is looking at CCTV tapes. We see COLIN, unrecognizable on cheap video. Then we see a blurred image of BILLY. Crossing the street in beats. No more use as ID than the Shroud of Turin. \nEXT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. NIGHT (RAINING) \nThrough grated windows we can see Madolyn finishing up her packing. BILLY KNOCKS on the door, which leads only into Madolyn's basement apartment. A long beat and she opens the door. The chain on. \nBILLY Your name's on the pill label. I thought you weren't supposed to be in the book, in case of obsessive patients. \nMADOLYN How obsessive are you? \nBILLY Medium. \nMADOLYN Are you okay? Why are you here? \nBILLY I really liked our conversations. I've been...regretting that we didn't continue...our conversations. \nMADOLYN I'm glad you want to see me...it's nice to see you...I enjoyed talking...I enjoyed having coffee with you, very much...but I don't see people...I don't see people in my home. \nBilly gets soaked. \nINT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS \nBILLY looks around and sees: boxes, transition. The furniture already gone. An air-mattress on the floor. There are still tea things on the counter. A basic life is still possible here. Madolyn has been making tea here, sleeping here, reading in bed. Billy, soaked, a drowned rat, is looking vulnerable and honest. \nBILLY Thanks. If this is inappropriate... I can leave. \nMADOLYN takes a moment to react. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMADOLYN No, it's, it's, it's not inappropriate...you're not a patient... \nBILLY You moving in or out? \nMADOLYN I still have three weeks on the lease... \nBILLY is looking at THE PICTURE to which Colin objected. A young girl in front of a rust belt slum, tilted in a box of effects. \nMADOLYN (CONT'D) That's me. \nBILLY Yeah, I know. \nHe hangs the picture on a nail. \nMADOLYN (the kettle whistles OS) Would you like a cup of tea? \nBILLY nods. \nBILLY Yeah. Yeah I would. Thank you. \nMadolyn leaves him looking vaguely around the apartment. In the kitchen, it appears that Madolyn has forgotten how to make a cup of tea. She perseveres, comes out holding two cups. Billy is looking at the handful of books still in the apartment. \nMADOLYN Do you want some... \nBILLY Sugar?   No... \nShe hands him the cup of tea. Strung out, he spills his tea, slightly, unobserved by Madolyn. Madolyn looks over at the bed, the book, the lamp, the incontrovertible evidence that she's probably really, in fact, not that into Colin.. \nMADOLYN I've always needed my own place. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBILLY Hedging your bets? \nMADOLYN No. I'm not \"hedging my best\"...I told you when we had coffee...There's a choice. You choose...you have to make a... \nBILLY Decision. \nMADOLYN ...decision...and stick by what...you choose...you have to... \nCOSTELLO leaves. \nINT. COSTELLO'S KITCHEN. DAY/INTERCUT: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE \nCOSTELLO is on the phone. MISTER FRENCH is sitting on a stool, smoking. OPERA playing on sound. \nCOSTELLO You heard nothing? \nCOLIN No. \nCOSTELLO Nothing about drugs. Nothing about new guys, nothing about Gloucester? \nCOLIN No, Frank, not a thing. And I promise you I would have heard about it. \nCOSTELLO hangs up and turns to MISTER FRENCH. \nCOSTELLO You're sure. No other departments, no codes, like that... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOLIN'S VOICE Frank.   You can relax on this one. \nCOSTELLO Okay, Collie. I will. \nCostello hangs up and turns to Mr. French. \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) (emotionally) It ain't Bill. No way, he says. Thank God for Billy. \nINT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS. DAY \nEverybody is busy in the office. It's COLIN's first day of Internal Investigations. COLIN'S moving through the bullpen. COPS stare at him with resentment. \nCOLIN Morning. \nHe comes up to Queenan's door just as Dignam comes out. DIGNAM faces COLIN down. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) A problem? \nDIGNAM Yeah, I run rat fucks like you.   I don't like them. \nCOLIN The day you wouldn't take a promotion, you let me know. And I wouldn't even have a job if you did yours. \nDIGNAM Fuck yourself. \nCOLIN I need to know the identity of your undercovers. \nDIGNAM Blow me. Not literally, there's no promotion in it for ya. \nHe walks away. \nCOLIN goes into Queenan's office. \nINT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER \nQUEENAN puts the cig into a cup of water, and throws it into the trash. \nCOLIN Morning, Captain. \nQUEENAN Look who's here. The Queen of the prom. \nCOLIN They are not happy with me. Especially Staff Sergeant Dignam. \nQUEENAN What do you expect? Everybody knows you're assigned here to find Costello's rat. They want to find the leak as much as you do. What they do not want is to be accused of being the rat. \nCOLIN sits uneasily. \nCOLIN Fair enough. Well one of them has to be dirty, We know that, right? \nQUEENAN Two days ago, my undercover guy in Costello's organization---- \nCOLIN Who is that? \nQUEENAN Lots of luck. (Not a chance.) You can go over my head, high as you like. You still won't get an answer. \nCOLIN Fair enough. \nQUEENAN As I said, two days ago, my guy nearly found out who Costello's rat is. He lost him in the street. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOLIN Really?   Did he get a look at him? \nQUEENAN ...No. \nCOLIN Nothing that could help us? \nQUEENAN Nah. \nCOLIN (swallows) (Too bad.) Any advice?   Generally? \nQUEENAN Costello can't do (much) business without coordinating with his source... (gestures out window) Who is here. In SIU. Follow Costello and you'll find his rat. \nCOLIN realizes: Just follow Queenan and you'll find his rat. \nQUEENAN (CONT'D) (turns away) You're going to be looking at my people. Going through their bank statements, phone bills, medical records. Don't expect them to get you a coffee or invite you to their houses. Let me get you a coffee. \nINT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. DAY \nCOLIN is sitting in his office alone, remembering what Queenan has just told him: \nQUEENAN (V.O.) Follow Costello and you'll find his informer. \nIn the fishbowl of his glass office, COLIN is being stared at by pissed-off cops. COLIN calms down. He opens the gray envelope. He takes out the forms that he was given by Costello, opens up POLICE PERSONNEL DATABASE and starts searching. He types in SS numbers. One, then another, then another. The result is always: \"Person not found\". He types in Costigan, William M, hits return. It comes up: \"Person not found\". COLIN keeps working. \nINT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. LATER \nMUGSHOTS of all of Costello's guys. He looks at them desperately...no one squares up with the blurred, impossible, images he saw on the CCTV screen (which he has printed out).COLIN closes the curtains on his fishbowl office (not fast enough to avoid seeing Dignam give him the finger), locks his door. He picks up the phone. \nVOICE ON PHONE (V.O.) Internal Investigations. \nCOLIN This is Sullivan. I need constant surveillance on Captain Queenan, starting right now. \nCOLIN (angrily) I have to follow every lead, however unlikely, however fucking painful it might be to your delicate fucking sensibilities. \nDETECTIVE 1 Who says I have delicate sensibilities? \nCOLIN I have reason to believe that Queenan is Costello's informer. Follow him, and don't get made. \nDETECTIVE 1 Copy that, Sarge \nThe detectives in the car get alert and start their car as QUEENAN comes out of the building. \nDETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D) We got him. \nDETECTIVE 2 Sarge, we got the target. \nEXT. TREMONT STREET/FINANCIAL DISTRICT. DAY \nDETECTIVE 1 trails Captain Queenan through the crowds of people heading towards work. \nINT. PARK ST. SUBWAY STATION. MORNING \nQUEENAN begins to light a cigarette and then gives it up. A TRAIN comes in, and Queenan boards. DETECTIVE 1 boards the next car. \nINT. DETECTIVE 1'S SUBWAY CAR. MOMENTS LATER \nLooking through smeared glass into the next car as the train begins to move DETECTIVE 1 sees QUEENAN answer a cell call. \nINT. QUEENAN'S SUBWAY CAR. CONTINUOUS \nQUEENAN is on his cell. \nQUEENAN Where are you now? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY Look down the car. \nQUEENAN looks up mildly as the car rocks. \nBILLY (CONT'D) Got me? \nQUEENAN'S POV: \nBILLY is slumped in a seat at the far end, not looking towards QUEENAN. \nBILLY (CONT'D) Any reason you'd have a tail? \nQUEENAN No...Of course not. \nBILLY (on the verge of hyperventilating) I'm watching a guy... \nQUEENAN I don't have a tail, Billy. \nThrough the glass we see DETECTIVE 1 watching Queenan. \nBILLY Okay. Get off at South Station. You wait there for ten minutes. After I leave I'll text message you the address where we'll meet. I'll make sure you don't have a tail. \nQUEENAN South Station. Wait ten minutes. \nAs the train stops BILLY vaults off of it. On the platform he walks along, texting. \nEXT. SOUTH STATION SUBWAY EXIT. LATE MORNING \nQUEENAN, mild in his specs, chewing gum with his dentures, comes out of the station, and looks at the TEXT MESSAGE on his phone. \nEXT. A STREET SOUTH OF FT. POINT CHANNEL. MOMENTS LATER \nA building under rehab, covered with scaffolding, but still functioning as a corporate building. QUEENAN goes along to the entrance, and in. \nDETECTIVE 1 comes along after him. We see the Internal Investigations car up the street. DETECTIVE 1 dials his cellphone. \nDETECTIVE 1 He went into a building on the waterfront. Address is 344 Wash... \nINT. THE LOBBY. MOMENTS LATER \nDETECTIVE 1 looks at the elevator-indicator, and the building directory. \nDETECTIVE 1 He went to the top floor. It's empty. No tenants. \nINT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS \nCOLIN, listening, playing with a COIN. \nEXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. MOMENTS LATER \nDETECTIVE 1 emerges from the building and joins other detectives in the car. \nDETECTIVE 1 I don't know what we're doing here. \nINT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2/BRASSERIE. CONTINUOUS \nCOLIN, after fumbling between cell phones, dials the correct one. \nCOLIN (to COSTELLO) I think I've got him. I think Queenan is meeting with him right now. \nEXT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. MOMENTS LATER \nFITZY and DELAHUNT'S phones ring simultaneously. \nDELAHUNT Get the van. Get the boys. \nEXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. CONTINUOUS \nBILLY is waiting on the roof as QUEENAN finally arrives. \nQUEENAN I assume these premises do not have an anti-smoking ordinance. So, what's going on? \nBILLY I told you, he's got dope coming in, I don't know where. He's getting spooky, Captain... \nQUEENAN What do you mean? \nBILLY He's crazy. I just saw the man. He had blood all over him. I can't get any more information for you. I can't trust it. He's not including his regular guys... I'm telling you, he's gonna find out who I am. He's gonna fuckin' kill me, I know it. \nQUEENAN All right, all right. I hear you. I'm sorry for you trouble. Look, I'm not gonna jeopardize your safety any longer. I'll get you out. I can't do it overnight but I'll do it. We can bust him for what we have. At least I think we can...I hope. You're out of there ASAP. \nEXT. THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING. CONTINUOUS \nFITZY, DELAHUNT and boys come out. The crew has seen the UNMARKED COP CAR. FITZY grabs BILLY. \nFITZY You're fuckin' late. Where the fuck were you? Get in the fuckin' van. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY What the fuck happened?    I came to meet you. \nThey start piling into a van. \nINT. THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR. CONTINUOUS \nDETECTIVE 2 is yelling both at his partner and into the mic. \nDETECTIVE 1 Stay in the fucking car. Stay in the fucking car. This is a surveillance unit. (into mic to Colin) Do I pursue. \nINT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS \nCOLIN is sitting very calmly. \nCOLIN No. Stay where you are. I need some fucking information here. What came off the building? \nDETECTIVE 1 I'm not sure. \nINT./EXT. INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR/ THE STREET. CONTINUOUS \nDETECTIVE 1 No pursuit. No pursuit. \nDETECTIVE 1 (CONT'D) Fuck that. \nDETECTIVE 1 gets out of the car and runs towards the fleeing men, gun drawn. \nFITZY turns on DETECTIVE 1 with a pistol drawn. DETECTIVE 1 fires and DELAHUNT is hit in the stomach. FITZY shoots the detective (he is wounded in the hand, not killed). The VAN takes off. \nDETECTIVE 4 Thirty-two X to CP. Thirty-two X to CP. We're being fired upon. I repeat. \nINT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS \nON RADIO. \"Officer down\", etc. COLIN has never felt more guilty in his life. \nDETECTIVE 4 (V.O.) We have an officer down. An officer has been shot. Request immediate assistance. \nHe switches off the light and sits in the dark as the afternoon gathers. \nINT. THE DEAD BAR. NIGHT \nFITZY, BILLY, and the BOYS are drinking. Dirty, paranoid, guilty, frightened, smoking. DELAHUNT has been shot, is dying, on a dirty couch. \nFITZY sits down and looks at Billy. \nFITZY And where the fuck were you? \nBILLY Boss told me to go home. \nFITZY Maybe he did and maybe he didn't. At any rate you weren't fuckin' home. \nBILLY I was in a fucking grocery store with no signal. When I got a signal I got the call. What the fuck do you want. Was I there or was I not there? Huh? \nFITZY walks away. \nDELAHUNT (OS) Billy. Billy (Billy goes over to him) \nBILLY (re: his wounds) Jesus Christ. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDELAHUNT Two days...two days ago the Boss says to me, it's been ten years already, and you've never done me wrong. He asked me, if one of the other guys is a rat, would I take him out. I told him I would but I don't know if I would. Now I know I can't. I've done a lot of bad things but I've never been a murderer. \nBILLY realizes that DELAHUNT is dying. \nDELAHUNT (CONT'D) Hey Billy, I don't want no one to put me in a dumpster. Just don't put me in a dumpster. \nBILLY When you're dead it makes no difference where they put you. \nBILLY lights him a cigarette. \nDELAHUNT You know what I thought today? \nBILLY What's that? \nDELAHUNT Who didn't show up today is the rat. \nBILLY Yeah, so? \nDELAHUNT You never been late in your life. And when I called you... I made a mistake. I gave you the wrong address. But you showed up at the right one. \nDELAHUNT grips his arm. BILLY is terrified. \nDELAHUNT (CONT'D) Tell me why I didn't say anything. Tell me why. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nHe waits for DELAHUNT to continue. But DELAHUNT after an odd smile of complicity, finally dies. BILLY, the only one who knows that DELAHUNT is dead, stares down at him. \nFITZY (drinking) That cop was tough. We were excessive with the cop. \nBILLY walks past the table. \nBILLY He's dead. I'm going home. \nBILLY leaves by the front door. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM. NIGHT \nAll hands present. Dignam is in a black silent rage. \nELLERBY Do you know why Queenan went to that building? \nGWEN (CONT'D) Let me straighten you out. \nCOLIN looks out into the bullpen. People working. On a table he sees PLASTIC BAGS which contains Queenan's bloodstained effects-- broken glasses, smashed wristwatch, and CELLPHONE. He glances around, and picks up the CELLPHONE. Blood gets on his fingers. He moves into the office, and seen through the glass, he seizes the phone and with trembling fingers punches up the last incoming number. \nINT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT KITCHEN. NIGHT \nBILLY is looking at a chipped SANTA MUG from his childhood and is eating something--sheer maintenance, and drinking wine from the bottle. His phone rings. He looks at the ID and is stunned. Queenan's number! He picks up the call but remains silent. The caller is also doing the same. \nINT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS \nCOLIN hears that the other side has hung up the phone. He sees: ELLERBY looking at him through the glass. But Ellerby hasn't seen the phone. \nINTERCUT BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT/COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS \nBILLY is agitated. Exhausted. Frightened. He paces, and looks at the phone. He begins to pack, assembling clothes, money. Finally, like a man committing suicide--it's that intense-- he dials the number. INTERCUT. \nCOLIN Yeah. \nBILLY You called this number on a dead guy's phone. Who are you? \nCOLIN So it is you. Thank God you're all right. We were very worried. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY Who are you? \nCOLIN You're talking to Sergeant Sullivan. I'm taking over Queenan's unit. \nBILLY Let me talk to Dignam to confirm it. \nCOLIN Staff Sgt. Dignam has... taken a leave of absence. He's very upset. We're all very upset. The best thing would be for your to come in. We need you to come in. \nBILLY listens to Colin go on. Then shuts off the phone. His other phone rings. \nCOLIN dumps out the box of Queenan's belongings. In the diary he sees an entry showing undercover suspects Costello is FBI informant. \nBILLY listens to Colin go on. Then shuts off the phone. His other phone rings. \nINT. THE CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. DAY \nCOSTELLO is sitting with his key guys, including FRENCH and FITZY. A TV station plays above the zinc bar. BILLY is drinking, hitting it heavily. \nNEWS ANCHOR State Police have confirmed that the body of the man found dead in the Fenway marshes yesterday afternoon is that of Timothy Delahunt, an undercover policeman for the City of Boston.. This was the scene today.... If you have any information about this murder, you are urged to call the Boston Police. \nThe TV shows DELAHUNT'S BODY being loaded into an ambulance. A crime scene. COSTELLO's eyes have widened slightly. But he is strangely undisturbed. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFITZY Fuck.   I can't believe it. \nMISTER FRENCH Don't believe what? \nFITZY I'm embarrassed. How the fuck did they find him so fast? I spent all fuckin' night out there, dragged the poor bastard.... I must have been there seven hours. In three feet of mud. What the fuck is a marsh? And who walks their dog in a fuckin' marsh? In three feet of water? I don't believe it. I still don't believe he's a fuckin' cop. \nCOSTELLO The cops are saying he's a cop so I won't look for the cop. (to FITZY) Are you soft? The next time I tell you to dump a body in the marshes, put it in the fuckin' marshes, not where some guy from John Hancock goes every Thursday to get a blowjob! \nHe makes a move for the door. \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) Proceed. \nThey get up to leave, following him. \nEXT. SOUTHEAST EXPRESSWAY. NIGHT \nTwo cars carrying Costello and his men are speeding down the highway. Behind them, two SIU CARS are trailing. \nINT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2/COSTELLO'S CAR. CONTINUOUS \nCOLIN closes his door and punches in a number. \nIN COSTELLO'S CAR, his cell phone rings. \nCOSTELLO Jesus Christ. \nHe answers it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) What? \nCOLIN Don't go. You've got a tail. Two cars. Not very subtle. They won't be subtle from now on. That's what I've been trying to tell you. \nCOSTELLO Get rid of them. \nCOLIN There's no need to go yourself, Frank. \nCOSTELLO Get rid of the fuckin' tail! \nCLOSE on COLIN as what he has to do crystallizes. \nCOLIN I will.   All right. \nA cold look in his eye, Colin leaves his office and goes down the hall. \nIN THE CAR \nCostello remarks to French -- \nCOSTELLO Tails. Fuckin' rats. This rat shit is wearing me thin. \nFRENCH Francis, they're all rats. Women are rats... cunts...Yeah, we're becoming a nation of rats. \nINT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER \nBROWN is there. BARRIGAN. ELLERBY. Others. \nCOLIN Stop. Stop. Pull these guys off. Tell your team to stop following Costello. We don't need to surveil him. \nCOLIN stands in the door like a gunfighter. Everyone looks at him. \nMADOLYN pulls the headphone jack out of the stereo and roughly the following booms out of the speakers. [NOTE: THIS RECORDING WAS DONE IN POST -- I THINK FROM THE PORN THEATRE DIALOGUE.] \nCOLIN (CONT'D) Your guys shouldn't have done that. \nCOSTELLO One of us was going to have to die. It tends to be the other guy. \nCOLIN stares at her and we ought to think murder is a possibility. \nCOLIN I'm now in charge of everything here. Including Queenan's informers. Theoretically. I can't unlock the files until after the brass squeezes Dignam. If the brass squeezes Dignam. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCOSTELLO So Dignam's the only one with the keys to the kingdom. \nCOLIN He's fucking resigning. He put his papers in. He's not talking. \nCOSTELLO Give me his location. Tonight. \nCOLIN and MADOLYN stare at each other. \nMADOLYN I thought I was the liar. \nCOLIN I can explain. \nShe goes into the bedroom. COLIN'S PHONE RINGS. He answers it. \nEXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. DAY \nBILLY is walking, on the phone, happy, and twisting the knife. \nBILLY Costello recorded everything. He put all the tapes in a little box and kept them with his lawyer. That was his insurance. His lawyer came to me. Costello trusted me the most. Imagine that you rat fuck. Sound quality good enough? I was a little worried. \nINT. MADOLYN AND COLIN'S APARMENT. CONTINUOUS \nCOLIN closes a door to speak privately. \nCOLIN What do you want? \nBILLY I want my identity, you two-faced rat prick. \nCOLIN Where are you? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY Three o'clock. Where Queenan died. You keep your cell on. \nCOLIN goes to the bedroom door and tries it. Locked. He knocks. No answer. \nCOLIN Did we not talk about this?   This is my job. \nIt's over. He starts to punch the door, and then does not. \nEXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY \nCOLIN comes along and walks into the lobby. He is not looking for a tail... \nEXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. DAY \nCOLIN looks out through the door, no gun drawn, but very much a cop clearing his corners. He steps out and--BILLY takes him from behind the door, his only blind side, and grabs the back of his collar and crams a pistol into the bottom of his skull. \nBILLY Get your hands up.   Hands.   Hands. \nCOLIN Put the fuckin' gun down. \nBILLY turns Colin around and puts the pistol to Colin's forehead, hard enough to break the skin. He takes out Colin's belt gun and puts it in his pocket. (Billy screams \"hands!\" at Colin every time he makes a move). \nCOLIN (CONT'D) I came here to talk some fucking sense to you. You get a hold of yourself and put down the fuckin' firearm and act professional and I can get you your money. \nBILLY (turning him around) What did you say? \nCOLIN I can get you your... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY cracks him across the jaw with the gun. COLIN goes down. COLIN is drooling blood, his bell rung, one eye open. Billy throws away Colin's ankle gun. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) (spitting teeth) Fuck, shit... \nBILLY (going for Colin's cuffs) You didn't come here to talk, you fuckin' maggot, you came here to get arrested. \nCOLIN Arrested? Arrested for what. (as BILLY cuffs him) So you got tapes of what? Costello was my informant. I was his rat? Fuck you. Prove it. I say he was my informant. \nBILLY Get up and shut your fuckin' mouth. \nCOLIN What is this, a citizen's arrest? Blow me, prick. Only one of us is a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who you are. Nobody knows who you are. \nBILLY Would you shut the fuck up. \nCOLIN I'm a sergeant in the Mass. State Police. Who the fuck are you? Nobody. I ERASED YOU. \nBILLY puts the gun to Colin's head. \nBILLY You erased me? \nCOLIN Go ahead. Shoot a cop, Einstein. See what happens. \nBILLY What would happen is the bullet would go right through your fuckin' head. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCOLIN Watch what happens. \nBILLY What, you think you're gonna get the parade? The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you. (safeties the gun) I'm arresting you. \nCOLIN That's the stupidest thing you could do. \nBILLY Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up. (hits him) I don't give a fuck if these charges don't stick.

THE SCHOOL-BUS, FULL OF BLACK KIDS, IS HIT WITH BRICKS, ROCKS. N.B.: (THIS IS NOT SETTING THE LIVE ACTION IN 1974; IT IS A HISTORICAL MONTAGE, THE BACKGROUND FOR COSTELLO'S V.O.). \nINT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY. \nCOSTELLO's profile passes in a dark room. \nCOSTELLO (V.O.) Years ago, we had the Church. That was only a way of saying we had each other. The Knights of Columbus were head-breakers. They took over their piece of the city. \nEXT. SOUTHIE. VARIOUS \nThe neighborhood. 1980's. We won't be here long. This isn't where Costello ends up. It's where he began. Liquor stores with shamrocked signs. MEN FISHING near Castle Island. Catholic SCHOOLKIDS playing in an asphalted schoolyard. \nCOSTELLO (V.O.) Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get a job, we had the presidency. That's what the niggers don't realize. If I got one thing against the black chaps it's this. No one gives it to you. You have to take it. \nINT. LUNCH COUNTER. DAY \nCOSTELLO comes in. The shop is one that sells papers, sundries, fountain drinks...and fronts a bookie operation. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (leaning over cluttered counter) Don't make me have to come down here again. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPROPRIETOR Won't happen again, Mr. C. \nThe frightened proprietor hands over money. Fifty bucks, a hundred, doesn't matter. COSTELLO is never the threatener. His demeanor is gentle, philosophical. Almost a shrink's probing bedside manner. He has great interest in the world as he moves through it. As if he originally came from a different world and his survival in this one depends on close continual observation and analysis. \nYOUNG COLIN looks up. CLOSE ON his eyes. He is fourteen or fifteen, but small for his age. Bookish. \nCOSTELLO eyes the proprietor's TEENAGE DAUGHTER, working behind the counter. He takes a propane lighter, and, strangely, pays for it (the proprietor startled) and waits for change. He lights a MORE cigarette with the lighter. \nYOUNG COSTELLO Carmen's developing into a fine young lady. You should be proud. You get your period yet, Carmen? \nThe PROPRIETOR is uneasy. COSTELLO turns to YOUNG COLIN (about 14) staring at the local hero. Costello reaches up above and behind the counter and takes down some cigarettes. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) You Johnny Sullivan's kid? \nCOLIN nods. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) You live with your grandmother? \nCOLIN nods. \nYOUNG COLIN Yeah. \nCOSTELLO tells the Proprietor to takes three loaves of bread and some soup off the shelves and puts them in Colin's bag. \nCOSTELLO Get him three loaves of bread. And a couple of half gallons of milk. And some soup. \nHe goes over to the fridge and puts two half gallons of milk in the bag. Some soup. Costello turns to Colin. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCOSTELLO (CONT'D) Do you like comic books? \nColin nods.   He adds a couple of comic books. \nWhen the PROPRIETOR looks at him, he takes out the money he put in his pocket and gives back half. \nYOUNG COSTELLO You do good in school? \nYOUNG COLIN nods, holding the big bag of loot. \nCOLIN Yes. \nYOUNG COSTELLO That's good. I did good in school. They call that a paradox. \nHe gives some money to Carmen. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) Buy yourself some makeup. Keep the change. \nLooks intently at COLIN to see if he gets it.    Colin does. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) You ever want to earn a little extra money, you come by L street. You know where I am on L street. \nCOLIN nods: everybody does. \nYOUNG COLIN Thank you. \nHe pushes out with the bags of groceries. \nThe PROPRIETOR can do shit about it. \nYOUNG COSTELLO watches YOUNG COLIN go off down a slummy street. \nINT. A CHURCH. MORNING. 1985-ISH \nYOUNG COLIN, the good boy, the very good boy, is serving at a funeral Mass. Various views of the church. Stained-glass light. The altar is still wreathed in the smoke of incense. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPRIEST (V.O.)

THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY \nCOSTELLO is talking informally (we realize that this is a continuation of the philosophical talk, the shadowy pacing). YOUNG KIDS. Useful young men. YOUNG COLIN, three years older, is among them. \nYOUNG COSTELLO Church wants you in your place. What sort of man wants to be kept in his place? Do this don't do that, kneel, stand, kneel, stand...I mean if you go for that sort of thing... \nYOUNG COLIN, the recent altar boy, visibly doesn't go for that sort of thing. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) I don't know what to do for you. A man makes his own way. No one gives it to you. You have to take it. (a beat) Non serviam. \nYOUNG COLIN James Joyce. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nYOUNG COSTELLO Him and Lucifer. And me. (to the room) Guineas from the North End and down Providence, tried to tell me what to do...And something maybe happened to them. \nEXT. A REMOTE BEACH. DAWN \nRose-colored dawn. YOUNG COSTELLO, with a pistol, executes a MAN kneeling in the surf. She falls on the body of a man who has just been executed. \nCOSTELLO Jeez, she fell funny. \nFRENCH moves forward with an axe in his hand. \nFRENCH Frank, you gotta see somebody. \nThey go about their business. \nINT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY \nYOUNG COSTELLO walking, talking...Not continuous with the above. We see that only YOUNG COLIN is present. \nYOUNG COSTELLO You decide to be something, you can be it. That's what they don't tell you, the Church. \nMISTER FRENCH is doing books off behind a window of dirty glass. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) When I was your age, they would say, we become cops or criminals. Today, what I'm saying to you is this: When you are facing a loaded gun... \nvery close on COSTELLO, holding Colin's shoulder. \nYOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D) What's the difference? \nECU: COLIN'S EYES swerve up. We are now on (MATURE) COLIN'S EYES eyes. This is how the character transits the \"age leap\"...on the unchanging eyes. \nTHE SAME EYES. \nPull back to reveal: \nPOLICE TRAINEES. (INCLUDING BARRIGAN, who is included in all Colin's trainee scenes). COLIN is in the class, wearing a trainee's uniform. He has a notebook, a pen. Writing. \nINSTRUCTOR The slug enters the skull by forming a small entrance hole. Blood and brain matter is ejected backwards from this hole. The bullet, which may expand, fragment or tumble, then passes through the brain... \nCOLIN writes. \nINT. FIRING RANGE. DAY \nPOLICE TRAINEES ON A FIRING RANGE. As we go along the line we see COLIN, firing dry and then speed-changing a clip in a BERETTA 92F. He is a perfect trainee. \nEXT. A TRAINING FIELD. DAY \nSTATE POLICE TRAINEES standing in a pissing rain, a DI yelling at them OS. COLIN is staring forward. RAIN streaming down his face. His opinion on the experience is not decipherable. Ad libs: \"Sir, yes, sir.\" \nEXT. THE BOSTON COMMON. DAY \nGuys we recognize from the previous shots at the State Police Academy (wearing Statie t-shirts), including COLIN and BARRIGAN, are playing rugby against some FIREFIGHTERS. Very rough game. The game breaks up with each group giving each other the finger. FIREFIGHTERS are moving away triumphantly. \nCOLIN Fucking firemen are getting pussy for the first time in the history of fire. Or pussy. \nCOLIN sits on a bench looking at THE GOLD DOME OF BEACON HILL. The terraces of fine townhouses. Aqueous golden light behind. Misty golden beauty. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBARRIGAN What are you looking at? Forget it. Your father was a janitor, and his son's only a cop. \nCOLIN (not vainglorious, but innocently stretching for the idea) You're in trouble if you're \"only\" anything. \nBARRIGAN Don't tell me I'm looking at the first dickhead-American president of the United States. \nCOLIN doesn't have a great sense of humor but he knows how to pretend that he does. He smiles. \nEXT. STATE POLICE GRADUATION CEREMONY. DAY \nBagpipes and bullshit. Flags cracking. Line after line of paramilitary-looking graduates, among them COLIN. \nSPEAKER (V.O.) The Massachusetts State Police has a long tradition of excellence. Your graduation today solidifies your acceptance into one of the finest law enforcement agencies in our nation. As the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am confident each and every one of you will serve with distinction, honor and integrity. \nCAMERA swirls around COLIN as he moves, a lone person, through the breaking up crowd. Other graduates are hugged by family. COLIN, alone, comes to the gates of the yard. \nTHE MAYOR VO Congratulations. You are dismissed. \nThe bagpipe band plays \"Minstrel Boy.\" \nCOLIN'S POV: \nAN OLDSMOBILE. COSTELLO and MISTER FRENCH standing by the car. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCOLIN walks over to the car. COSTELLO gives COLIN a BOX. COLIN flips open the top and then quickly closes it.

La di (fuckin') da. \nDignam leans over Billy. \nDIGNAM (CONT'D) You were kind of a double kid, I bet, right? One kid with your old man. One kid with your mother. Upper middle class in the week, and then dropping your 'r's and hanging in the Southie projects with daddy the donkey on the weekends.

And I think if I were Sigmund fucking Freud himself I wouldn't get an answer. So tell me, what's a lace curtain motherfucker like you doing in the Staties? \nBILLY Well. Families are always rising or falling in America. Am I right? \nQUEENAN (appreciative, kindly, looking up from his papers) Who said that? \nBILLY Hawthorne. \nSGT. DIGNAM (although he knows perfectly well who Hawthorne is) makes a fart-noise with his mouth. BILLY looks at him with an \"I'm going to kill you\" expression which is not without wit and which Dignam seems to admire. \nDIGNAM What's the matter, smartass? You don't know any fuckin' Shakespeare? \nQUEENAN We have a question. You want to be a cop, or do you want to appear to be a cop. It's an honest question. Lot of guys want to appear to be cops. Gun. Badge. Pretend they're on TV... \nSGT. DIGNAM A lot of em just want to slam a nigger's head through a plate glass window. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBILLY I'm all set without your personal job application, Sergeant. \nDIGNAM (after a \"we got a live one\" glance at Queenan) What the fuck did you say to me, trainee? \nBILLY looks at him, and then looks forward. \nBILLY Sir, with all due respect, sir, what is it you want from me? \nDIGNAM Hey asshole, he can't help you. I know what you are, and what you aren't. I'm the best friend you ever had on the face of the earth. I'm gonna help you understand something: You're no fuckin' cop. \nQUEENAN He's right. (Billy looks at Queenan) We deal in deceptions here. But what we don't deal with is self- deception. In five years, you might be anything else in the world, but you won't be a Massachusetts State trooper. \nBILLY You sure of that? \nQUEENAN I'm sure of that. \nDIGNAM Guaranteed. \nQUEENAN (looking up from his papers) You don't have much family. \nCLOSE ON BILLY. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nBILLY (deciding this on the spot) I don't have any family. \nEXT. HUNTINGTON AVENUE. LATE DAY \nA TROLLEY goes past. HOSPITAL HILL, above the trolley line, is sinister, quiet. HOSPITAL at the top like a malign fortress, above rows of endlessly repeated condominiums. BILLY CROSSES from the Trolley stop, desperately, an angry young man at his life's turning point. \nINT. A HOSPITAL ROOM. LATER \nBILLY'S MOTHER lies as if floating in her bed. Tubes, lights. A bald head on a barely-dented pillow. She is a cancer patient in a coma, weighing possibly 80 lbs. Gasping for air. Her airways are cleared with a suction tube. BILLY sits watching as the tube goes in. BILLY sits looking at her. \nEXT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATER \nBILLY is leaning against a wall. A maternal WASP UNCLE, a not- bright guy (pretensions, rather than status), speaks briefly to a DOCTOR further along the hall, then approaches BILLY, hands in the pocket of a good suit. \nWASP UNCLE What's this I hear from Stephanie about you becoming a policeman? \nBILLY You mean Stephanie who was the only one who came to my father's funeral? That Stephanie? \nUNCLE That Stephanie. \nBILLY Nothing much to it Uncle Edward. \nUNCLE Are you trying to prove something to the family? \nBILLY When you say \"family\", what do you mean? You? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nUNCLE You always question everything, don't you? \nBILLY Yeah, well, maybe it would have done you some good to have a question from time to time. \"Am I an asshole?\" \"Are my kids a mess?\" \"Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?\" Those are questions. (the UNCLE starts to leave) \"Have I been good to my dying sister or am I just pretending to be?\" (he's stung THE UNCLE) Too late now, right? \nUNCLE Do you need some money for the funeral? \nTHE UNCLE moves away, bends to get his overcoat. \nBILLY When my mother dies we don't have any connection.

We see, as COLIN does, beyond his reflection in the glass, the STATE HOUSE DOME. \nREALTOR This is it. Nice. You've got high ceilings, parquet floors. There's a lock on the fridge in case you have eating issues.... Joke...not a very good one. (uneasy) So, you're a policeman? \n", "test2_true": "CONTINUED: \nCOLIN (like something he is used to reciting) I'm a State Police detective. \nREALTOR (wondering where he gets his money from) State Police Detective. You a married State Police Detective? \nCOLIN (coming out of his reverie and coldly:) ...No. \nREALTOR Oh, cuz it's big and I wondered if a cop... \nCOLIN I have a cosigner. \nREALTOR You intend to have a housemate. That's cool. \nCOLIN Give me the fuckin' papers. \nEXT. HOSPITAL HILL OVERLOOK. NIGHT \nBILLY sits on a bench looking out over the whole city. (It is the best view of Boston, never seen in a film). He's smoking a cigarette, making his decision. \nINT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE.    DAY \nContinuation of the interview. \nBILLY So what do I do? \nQUEENAN During the war, Churchill used river mines. He'd float them down the rivers into Germany. They'd either hit something, or not. That's what we'll use you for. I'll float you down the river. The rest will happen. Or it won't... (a beat) (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: QUEENAN (CONT'D) By the way, this isn't police work for peanuts. There's money behind this operation. You won't be paid as a cop, but there is a bonus involved. Tax free. \nQUEENAN writes on a slip of paper and hands it to BILLY. BILLY looks up from the paper, impressed. \nDIGNAM Luck of the Irish. All that and you're still young enough to fuck undergraduates. \nQUEENAN We can't conceal that you've been a trainee. You'll be convicted of a crime. We're thinking that a guilty plea to assault and battery might make sense. \nDIGNAM Given your nature. \nQUEENAN You'll serve enough jail time to convince anyone that it's no set- up. You'll be on probation. The whole nine yards. \nDIGNAM I need you, pal. You've already pretended to be a Costigan from South Boston. \nBILLY looks up with a glazed insolence. In one beat he is not a scared trainee but a smart criminal. \nBILLY Every weekend...Sergeant. \nDIGNAM Perfect. \nQUEENAN Do it again. For me. \nEXT. HOSPITAL HILL OVERLOOK. NIGHT \nBILLY throws down his cigarette. He has decided. \nFILM TITLE:     THE DEPARTED \nEXT. CEMETERY. DAY \nPriest's cassock whipping in the wind. A few mourners (shabby genteel ladies, contemporaries of his mother), but Billy seems to have no real connection with any of them. \nLATER \nBILLY is alone at the grave. He looks at the tags on wind- blown wreaths. One gives him pause. Under a picture of The Virgin it reads: \"Heaven holds the Faithful Departed\" and is signed: \"F. Costello\". \nINT. JAIL HOLDING TANK. DAY \nA CELL DOOR CLOSES. On Billy. Looking like a real criminal. Not a pretend one. Frightened and resolute at once. BILLY is in a holding tank. \nEXT. THE BALCONY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. MORNING \nCOLIN, in a bathrobe, leans on the rail and looks at Boston. THE GOLD DOME visible. Colin drinks coffee. Not satisfied: worried. \nINT. A PROCESSING FACILITY. DAY \nBILLY, naked, holds his clothes in a bundle. Being processed out of jail. Beside him another guy, furtive, gruff, not trying to be friendly. \nOTHER PRISONER You're Bill Costigan? \nBILLY Who wants to know? \nOTHER PRISONER Nothin.' I know a Sean Costigan. L Street. \nBILLY My cousin. \nOTHER PRISONER Connected but not too bright-- (BILLY looks at him with an only-I-can-insult-my- cousin look) No offense. \nBilly gets his clothes. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY \nOn the wall is a rogues gallery of COSTELLO and all his primary guys...MISTER FRENCH, DELAHUNT, FITZY. COLIN and others sitting listening. COLIN, reading a paper (Boston Herald) which may or may not have the headline, CASE DROPPED AGAINST DRUGS CADET (featuring a picture of Billy), looks up as SGT. DIGNAM comes in. \nSGT. DIGNAM Sorry I'm late. \nELLERBY Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison with the undercover section. Their undercover work is extensive. He's here to give us his report. Sgt. Dignam. \nSGT. DIGNAM OK. They're out there, my people. They're like the fuckin' Indians. You're not gonna see them. You're not gonna hear about them except through me or Captain Queenan. You will not, ever, know the identity of undercover people. This shit hole, unfortunately, has more fuckin' leaks than the Iraqi navy. \nELLERBY Fuck yourself. \nSGT. DIGNAM I'm tired from fucking your wife. \nELLERBY How's your mother? \nSGT. DIGNAM Good. She's tired from fucking my father. (opens a FILE) OK, today, girls, what I got for you is microprocessors. \nLAZIO, the Fed, comes in and sits down. With folders, pencil. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n", "test2_id": 1543, "test3_input": "COLIN instantly raises the pistol to shoot him. \nCOLIN Did you give me up? \nCOLIN'S PISTOL wavers. \nCOSTELLO Nobody knows nothin'. \nCOLIN shakes his head and cocks the gun. \nCOLIN Frank, Frank, do they know about me? \nCOSTELLO I know you, Colin. You know I'd never give you up. You're like... \nCOLIN A son...to you? Is that what it is about, all that murderin' and fuckin' and no sons? What are you, shooting blanks? \nCOSTELLO tries to raise his gun which is inside his sleeve. He's sitting on his coat so that the shot goes off sideways as COLIN shoots him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCOSTELLO topples backward into the bucket of the bucket loader. \nANGLE ON COLIN. \nThen from the bucket loader, a post death tremor sets off one last shot from COSTELLO'S gun. Ricochet. COLIN fires into the dead body again and again. He backs away. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) I got Costello! I got Costello here! \nINT. POLICE HQ/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT \nColin is debriefed concerning the shooting of Costello. [Dialog separate document]. \nINT. BULLPEN AREA. DAY \nCOLIN enters, tired from a debriefing. Applause from everyone in the office--the full crew. COLIN is embarrassed by the attention. BROWN is leading the whole team to a standing ovation. COLIN looks past the heads of the crowd and sees: Dignam, staring at him evenly. \nCOLIN (to crowd) It's not any reason for, ah... \nQUEENAN'S SECRETARY brings him some wine. \nCOLIN (CONT'D) Thank you. \nQUEENAN'S SECRETARY No, thank you. \nHe takes a glass of wine. Then guiltily, almost in tears, he drinks. BROWN jerks a thumb towards Colin's office #2. \nBROWN He's waited a long time for you. (COLIN looks up and sees BILLY) How'd you get him without the files? \nCOLIN Caller ID. On Queenan's phone. You know that guy? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBROWN Yeah, we were classmates together. \nCOLIN I'm gonna go talk to him. \nCOLIN goes off. \nINT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. NIGHT \nIn Colin's office BILLY sits with his ankle on his knee. He looks very tired, dirty. Wearing a VISITOR badge. \nCOLIN Good to see you Trooper. \nBILLY Yeah.   \"Trooper\". \nCOLIN Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone. How long have you been undercover? \nBILLY Long time.     Long fuckin' time. \nCOLIN I can't begin to tell you what a debt we owe you. I want you to know I'll be recommending you for the Medal of Merit. \nBILL Medal of Merit. Oh, yeah. That's kinda like a gold star around here, right? \nCOLIN It's the highest honor we got. \nBILLY I just want my identity back. \nCOLIN You want to be a cop again? \nBILLY No, being a cop's not an identity. I want my identity back. \nCOLIN takes it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY (CONT'D) You'll have to excuse me. My only contact has been with a police shrink. \nCOLIN (throat clicks) A police shrink. (instead of asking the obvious) Was that... helpful for you? \nBILLY What are you gonna do about the rat in this building? \nCOLIN I'm gonna find him. Don't you worry about that. You got anything? Did Frank, ah, say anything... \nBILLY I'm all done being a cop. I just want to get my money and go home. \nCOLIN Fair enough. You've given a lot. I can get you your file. I just need your password. \nBILLY The password's my name, William Costigan, Jr. They gave it to me in case something happened to them and I had to explain myself to someone like you. \nHe writes it.    Colin takes the paper and hides his astonishment. \nCOLIN All right, Bill. Just give me a minute. I'm gonna go in the other room. This computer's gone blooey on me. \nBilly nods.    He goes. \nINT. COMPUTER ROOM. NIGHT \nCOLIN accesses the personal database, enters the password. Billy's confidential file opens up. Every fact about the man. Photos. \n", "test3_true": "Billy takes a drink from the bottle COLIN has put on the desk. As he puts the bottle down he sees, sticking out of a box, a BROWN ENVELOPE. On it is written \"CITIZENS.\" BILLY picks up the envelope...and knows everything. \nINT. COMPUTER ROOM. CONTINUOUS \nCOLIN is reviewing it Billy's file. Outside the glass wall we see BILLY, staring at COLIN's back...and then moving on. \nINT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. LATER \nCOLIN enters, holding a printout of Billy's personnel file. He looks around the empty room. He sees the BROWN ENVELOPE lying on the desk, and understands everything. He sits down at his own computer--which does in fact work, and opens the personnel file. \nCOLIN clicks DELETE. \"Do You Really Want to Delete?\" COLIN clicks \"Yes\" and Billy's picture, file, life, disappear. \nEXT. POLICE BUILDING. NIGHT \nBILLY exits the police building and moves across the plaza. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MADOLYN'S OFFICE - DAY \nBILLY waits outside Madolyn's office. \nMADOLYN, carrying work, breakfast, rounds the corner and sees him standing and waiting for her. She's a little spooked, opens her mouth to speak... \nBILLY I know. I'm not here to...I'm not here for that. I've got something to...to give to you...something I need you to keep. For me. \nMADOLYN What is it? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBILLY (stopping her from speaking) I need you to be my friend here and not ask any questions. That's for you to hold. \nHe gives her a manila envelope. \nBILLY (CONT'D) Only you. Open this if I'm dead or if I call you and tell you to open it. Please do exactly what it says. Exactly what it says, please. \nMadolyn is a friend. She's not going to ask questions.           She accepts the envelope. \nMADOLYN All right. \nBILLY I'm sorry to show up here like this. There was no one else I could give it to. I'm sorry. There was no one else. \nHe backs away, and then turns to go. \nMADOLYN I...we... (he turns) I've, it's, been so confused... I just want to say... \nHe turns and looks at her.          She doesn't speak: can't. \nBILLY Whatever you have to say, really think about it, and if you still want to tell me, tell me in two weeks, all right? \nShe moves her head slightly, watches him go. \nINT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER. \nMADOLYN sits at her desk, devastated, looking at a fall of light. The envelope lies on her blotter. She sits on ... then straightens up, takes a marker and writes \"COSTIGAN\" on the envelope and puts it in her desk drawer. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWe DISSOLVE to a SONOGRAM. \nINT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. MORNING \nA SONOGRAM picture of a fetus. It looks to him at first like a CCTV picture blown up. COLIN stares as if at something in a horror film. \nCOLIN I was dreaming... \nMADOLYN What? \nCOLIN I was dreaming I was dead. \nMADOLYN Death is hard. Life is much easier. \nReferring to the envelope \nCOLIN What's this? \nMADOLYN Open it \nHe does. \nCOLIN Really? \nMADOLYN Yeah. \nCOLIN Really? \nMADOLYN Yeah. \nCOLIN You're joking... \nMADOLYN It's not a joke, it's a human being. \nColin belatedly thinks of what a human being might do in these circumstances and kisses her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nINT COLIN'S APARTMENT - LATER \nCOLIN is in the shower. MADOLYN moves into the     kitchen and puts the kettle on. She checks the mail, lying     there on the counter. It's tied with a string. She undoes       the string and sorts through the mail. Suddenly, she freezes      looking at: \nAN OVERSIZED ENVELOPE addressed to COLIN: [COLIN SULLIVAN, 20 Pickering Street, Apt TK, Boston, MA, zip TK], with a return address of Wm. Costigan, 13 Conant St., Boston, etc., etc.] \nMADOLYN stares at the envelope, listening to the shower going. Billy has written to her fiance. She starts to put the envelope down, and then realizes...she has to hide it...she has to open it. \nInside the envelope is a jewel case: EXILE ON MAIN STREET. And a note: PLAY ME NOW. MADOLYN puts the CD into the machine. She puts on the headset and listens...and listens. \nCOLIN comes out of the bathroom, dressed in jeans and t- shirt, barefoot, his hair wet. He looks at Madolyn, realizing that something is wrong. \nCOLIN What? \n", "test3_id": 1544}

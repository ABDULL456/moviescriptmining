AT-ST CLONE SERGEANT: Everyone out of there! 
A CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all directions. 
CREATURE: Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee. (crazy little laugh) 
CLONE SERGEANT: Did you find something? 
CREATURE: It's nothing, nothing. (laughs) 
CLONE SERGEANT: It's nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east. 
CLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir. 
Suddenly, CHEWBACCA climbs up behind the AT-ST CLONE, dripping wet, and throws the CLONE SERGEANT into the water. CHEWIE BARKS. 
CREATURE: Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be. 
TARFFUL jumps up in the boat, and the CREATURE takes off his hair. It is Yoda. 
YODA: Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me. 
YODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. TARFFUL climbs onto the AT-ST with CHEWBACCA. YODA is out of the water and putting his robes back on. 
YODA: (continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . . 
YODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CAN-CELL appears. YODA jumps on the insect's back and they take off. The WOOKIEES follow on the AT-ST. The CLONES continue to search the swamp. 
153 EXT. KASHYYYK-HILLS OVERLOOKING LAKE-DUSK 
The AT-ST marches up the hill and stops. The WOOKIEES jump down. YODA lands on CAN-CELL nearby. CHEWBACCA goes to a tree and pulls down one of its branches. The ground opens up, and a small WOOKIEE ESCAPE POD rises into the field. YODA opens the door of the pod. 
YODA: Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have. 
The Wookiees BARK as the Jedi climbs into the WOOKIEE POD and takes off into the dusk sky. 
154 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND STARSHIP LANDING PLATFORM-DAY 
BAIL ORGANA walks out of a tunnel onto a huge underground platform with two of his AIDES. He is stopped by TWO ROYAL GUARDS. 
ROYAL GUARD: Identification . . . 
BAIL ORGANA: Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan. 
BAIL and his AIDES hand them their ID cards. The ROYAL GUARDS check them over and give them back, then BAIL and his CREW walk on board his Starship. 
155 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY 
The platform rises to the surface of the Office Building. The ALDERAAN STARCRUISER takes off and disappears into the crisp morning sky. 
156 INT ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY 
BAIL ORGANA is greeted by CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO ALDERAAN TROOPERS. 
BAIL ORGANA: Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon? 
CAPTAIN ANTILLES: Yes, sir. We've encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command. 
BAIL ORGANA: That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe. 
157 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LATE DAY 
OBI-WAN hides from a group of CLONE TROOPERS. 
CLONE CAPTAIN: Did you find Kenobi? 
CLONE TROOPER: No one could have survived that fall. 
He watches them pass. 
CLONE CAPTAIN: Start loading your men on the ship. 
CLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir. 
OBI-WAN tries to sneak back to the secret platform, down a flight of stairs. 
158 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY 
OBI-WAN makes his way out of the cave and onto General Grievous's secret landing platform. He runs to the Starfighter and climbs into the one-man ship. The Starfighter takes off and disappears into the sky. 
159 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE 
OBI-WAN flies away from the planet Utapau in General Grievous's tiny Starfighter. 
160 INT. GENERAL GRIEVOUS'S STARFIGHTER-SPACE 
OBI-WAN activates the controls on the Starfighter. He punches in several coordinates and codes. A BEEPING SOUND is heard. It quickly speeds up until it is a steady tone. OBI-WAN speaks into his comlink. 
OBI-WAN: Emergency Code Nine Thirteen ... I have no contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . . 
A BURST OF STATIC is heard- and a FUZZY HOLOGRAM image appears. 
BAIL: (hologram) . . . Kenobi . . . 
OBI-WAN: (continuing) I've locked on. Repeat. 
The FUZZY HOLOGRAM image comes into focus, and it is BAIL ORGANA. 
BAIL ORGANA: Master Kenobi??

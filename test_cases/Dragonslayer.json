{"train": "GALEN \nHe gawks skyward. Suddenly, the old man leans down and addresses him. \nULRICH (a shout) We have visitors! \nCUT TO: \nROTUNDA - NIGHT \nClustering together in the center of a wide reception hall is a contingent of weary peasants, awkward amidst the dusty rugs, drapes and heavy furniture. Their leader is a fineboned youth, not yet twenty. Like the others, he is uneasy; his name is Valerian. Hodge enters and sets a tray of mead before them. He leaves without a word. The visitors stare glumly at the refreshment, but are too timorous to go near it. \nCONJURING ROOM \nGalen helps Ulrich prepare for the audience. The sorcerer peers at himself in a full-length mirror, adjusting the hem of a black robe. \nULRICH Looks forbidding enough, don't you think? \nGALEN Here are your sticks. \nULRICH No -- they'll think me infirm. You know, Balisarius wore this whenever he changed lead into gold. He could really do that, you know. I never could. Too bad -- you'd stand to inherit some real wealth. \nGALEN You're in a morbid frame of mind. What's all this about dying? You don't even look sick. \nULRICH (tying on a sash) You still wearing that amulet? (Galen nods) Good. Don't lose it. It still belongs to me. \nHe backs away from the mirror and fits a silver coronet onto his head. \nULRICH Now, adeptus minor, get yourself a handful of that sulphurous ash over there... \nThe sorcerer starts down a circular stone staircase. \nTHE ROTUNDA \nThe visitors watch warily as a door swings open and Galen makes his entrance, his face expressionless and hands pressed together. He looks rather young to be the famous Ulrich. \nGalen allows a moment to go by, then throws his arms wide. Ka-whump! and Ulrich appears in the doorway in a smoky fireball. Alarmed, the visitors retreat. \nULRICH Nunc habeus lux! \nPffst! around the room candles flare in their niches. \nULRICH Et calor! \nIn the fireplace, the birch logs are suddenly ablaze. Ulrich totters to the hearth and extends long bony fingers toward the warmth. \nULRICH Welcome to Cragganmore. I am Ulrich. Which one of you calls himself Valerian? \nThe travelers are suitably dazzled by the magician's performance. The young leader of the party screws up his courage and speaks. \nVALERIAN That would be me. We are here on behalf... \nULRICH I know why you're here. You're a delegation from Urland, from beyond Dalvatia. Let's see the artifacts. \nThe travelers exchange nervous glances. Valerian motions to one of his companions. The man steps forward and hands over a leather pouch. One by one, Valerian places the contents on the table for Ulrich's inspection. \nCOURTYARD - DAY \nThe travelers are making ready for departure in the grey light of dawn. As Hodge stuffs provisions into a wicker box, Ulrich wraps padding on a newly fashioned pair of crutches. \nULRICH I know of this dragon. Vermithrax Pejorative: she's four hundred years old. As far as I can tell she's the last of her kind. Very appropriate that I'm the one to finish her off, don't you think? (he tries out the crutches) There. Flatten the highest mountain. What say you, Galen? (no answer) Speak up. (still no answer) You, Hodge. \nHodge mutters something inaudible and grimly keeps packing. \nULRICH (to Galen) While I'm gone see you keep your nose in your books and your hands out of my reagents. Leave my instruments alone too. \nGalen crouches against the castle wall; he regards his master sullenly. \nGALEN Look at yourself. How far will you get like that? A league, two leagues? \nULRICH I'm not worried about the road. \nGALEN (sarcastic) Why don't you wave your hands around and summon up a coach-and-four? \nULRICH Don't mock me. \nGalen gets up and calls out to the Urlanders. \nGALEN You pilgrims: You're used to lotteries. Why not draw straws to see who'll be first to carry ironshanks here. \nThis is too much for Hodge. \nHODGE Hold your tongue. If the master's got a mind to go, he'll go. \nGalen approaches the old sorcerer. \nGALEN Send me. You're always saying I need seasoning. I need a test. Let me go. \nULRICH You're not ready. \nGALEN I'm ready for anything. \nULRICH (wan smile) Don't be so hasty. Your time will come. \nThe walkers are ready to set forth. Hodge picks up his pack, steps forward and pulls open the great gate. \nHORSEMEN \nThree mounted men are outside the gate, helmets on their heads, swords on the belts and longbows across their shoulders. They look formidable. The Urlanders take a step backward. \nVALERIAN Tyrian!? \nTyrian is a lean, heavily bearded nobleman. There is a coat of arms on the shield strapped to the pommel of his saddle. \nTYRIAN (amiable) Good morning, all. \nVALERIAN We're not afraid of you. Give us the road. \nTYRIAN Why, the road is yours. All the way to Urland. It's a long journey, isn't it? But when you're in search of a sorcerer, I suppose no distance is too great. \nSensing trouble, Galen moves forward. Ulrich touches his arm. \nEveryone is filled with dread. Hodge is shaking. From the castle come the rattling of shutters and Galen's muffled cries. A sick sarcastic smile has crept over Tyrian's lips. He tenses himself to thrust. \nULRICH Go on. Don't worry, you can't hurt me. \nCONJURING ROOM \nGalen stops hammering and presses his face to a crack in the shutter. Below he can see the participants in this grisly drama. He holds his breath. Tyrian makes a sudden movement and buries the blade in Ulrich's chest. But the sorcerer stands unbent, seemingly unhurt. Then, after a long moment, he slowly sags forward over the dagger and the hand that holds it. Tyrian shrinks back and allows the body to fall in a heap. Very quickly he remounts. In another moment he and his companions are gone. The others are riveted in horror. Hodge sinks to his knees and wails his grief. \nGalen turns away from the window and gazes blankly into the gloomy conjuring room. Click! The doors unlatch themselves and swing open. \nCUT TO: \nFUNERAL PYRE - DAY \nUlrich, principal magician and sorcerer of the western world, reposes on a hardwood pyre. His hands are folded on his chest. His face is peaceful. While the visitors wordlessly look on, Galen touches a burning brand to the kindling. At first the fire catches normally enough, but when the flames start to envelop the body they suddenly turn pale green, producing an unearthly roar. The onlookers back away from the intense heat. \nGALEN \nThe erstwhile apprentice stands his ground, blinking back tears, his face weirdly illuminated by the fire. \nCUT TO: \nCONJURING ROOM - DAY \nGalen sits alone amidst the museum-like collection of magical apparatus. He stares at the amulet, considering its significance. His reverie is interrupted by the murmur of voices below. At the window he looks down to see Hodge bidding farewell to the delegation from Urland. Valerian is the last to leave. He pauses at the gate and glances up at Galen. Then he moves on. The young student of magic sets his jaw, suddenly filled with resolve. \nMoving through the room, he busies himself with the old man's effects. He scoops up the loose books and parchments and locks them into trunks. He drapes muslin cloths over the alchemical devices. He sows a handful of salt over the pentagram inscribed in the floor. Finally, he opens the cages and releases the crow, the falcon, and the great horned owl. \nCOURTYARD \nHodge is up on the burned out funeral pyre, anxiously scraping ashes and small bones into a leather pouch -- the remains of Ulrich. Up behind him comes Galen, now clad in a traveler's cloak, with a pack on his back and a staff in his hand. \nGALEN Hodge -- what are you doing? \nHodge quickly conceals the pouch. \nHODGE Just making my farewell, thank you very much. \nHe quickly climbs down, picks up his pack and follows Galen out through the gate. As the door is pushed shut a huge oaken timber falls into place, barring the castle against the uninvited. \nCUT TO: \nHILLTOP - DAY \nGalen and Hodge labor to the crest of a grassy hill and turn to look back across a wide valley. There on another hilltop on the far side sits Cragganmore, lit by the red rays of the setting sun. Galen removes the amulet from his neck and clutches it in his fist. Hodge is bug-eyed to see it. \nHODGE Be careful with that! You don't know what you're doing. \nGALEN Stand back! \nHe raises his hands toward the castle and calls out: \nGALEN Cragganmore! Domus non i am! Silva celet! \nCRAGGANMORE \nGREIL Because some people said, find a magician. Not just a local fellow, an import, a good forty leagues from home. An all-powerful necromancer. Ha -- some necromancer! \nMalkin, an older man, speaks up. \nMALKIN Hold your tongue, Greil. Sit. Eat. \nGREIL I'll not sit. I'll not eat. See you the Great Bear. His tail points east. It's the equinox. Have you forgotten? Or rather not think about it? \nVALERIAN (miserable) He's right. I brought us here for nothing. May the gods help whoever's daughter it is tonight. \nThere is a noise from the darkness beyond the campfire. Two of the men get to their feet and listen. At first silence, then more rustling. Without a word the two men dart into the bushes and haul two interlopers before the company: Galen and Hodge. \nHODGE Good morrow, good morrow. Peace be with you. \nGALEN Easy now. We mean no harm. We've been looking for you. \nGREIL (growl) Well, you've found us. \nGALEN (brushing himself off) More the other way around, I'd say. \nVALERIAN What do you want? \nGALEN A few words, that's all. You were looking for a conjurer. \nVALERIAN He's dead. \nGALEN Right. Requiscat in pace. (he takes a deep breath) Ecce: magister novus! \nGREIL How say you? \nGalen surveys the puzzled faces. He draws himself up and plunges in: \nGALEN My lord Ulrich is no longer. All that you asked of him, you may now expect of me. The dangers he would face, I will now conquer. The task he would undertake I will now fulfill. I am Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor of Ulrich's craft and knowledge, and I am the Sorcerer you seek. \nThere is a moment of depressed silence. Hodge rolls his eyes. Greil starts to chuckle, then to laugh. Soon the others are laughing too. \nGREIL Well, that's a handsome thought, O wizard of wizards. But if there's one thing our friend Tyrian has shown us, it's to beware the pig in the poke. Who's got a dagger? \nHODGE No tests!! \nGREIL Call it proof, then. \nSomeone brings out a dagger and hands it to Greil. Valerian pushes it away. \nVALERIAN We've seen enough tests. \nBut Greil persists, waving the knife at the group. \nGREIL Well I haven't. All I've seen is death. Death in our families, death on the road, and tonight, death at home. \nHe lashes out with the knife. Galen jumps back, but Valerian steps in, delivering a quick kick to Greil's gut, followed by a right to the jaw that sends the bigger man sprawling. He takes the knife. \nVALERIAN What's come over you, anyway? Have you lost your wits? \nHe propels Galen out of harm's way and sits him down on the other side of the fire. Greil nurses his jaw. \nTyrian kneels beside a mountain waterfall, having a drink while his men hover in the background. One of them points down the slope. \nMAN There. I see them. \nTyrian wipes his mouth unhurriedly and strolls over to look. Far below, half hidden by trees, the little company of Urlanders winds its way through the forest. \nA frown creeps over Tyrian's face. \nTYRIAN Who's that old man? \nMAN Where? Which one? \nTYRIAN That one. That's the man from Cragganmore. Now what's he doing here? \nMAN Filling in for the chief, I reckon. \nTYRIAN (weary) What a pity. \nCUT TO: \nHODGE \nHodge marches along with the rest. When he's sure no one else is looking he burrows into his garments and brings out the leather pouch containing Ulrich's ashes. Reassured that it's still with him, he tucks it away again. Galen falls into step. \nGALEN What have you got there? \nHODGE None of your business. \nGALEN A little gold, eh? What do you say I change it into lead? \nHODGE Save your jokes for someone else. Me, I don't care for braggarts. \nThey pass Valerian, who has dropped out of line. \nHODGE And I don't care for frauds. \nGALEN I'm no fraud. \nHODGE Call it fool then. Upstart. Whatever pleases you. \nGALEN Hodge, nobody forced you to come along. \nHODGE Oh, I'm here of my own free will, all right. We each do the master's bidding in our own way. \nGALEN Well, if he told you I needed wetnursing, why don't you just turn yourself around and go back home. \nHodge snorts and fusses with his pack. \nHODGE Home, is it? You've seen to that, haven't you? Gone to seed, I'd say... \nHe glances over and discovers Galen missing. \nGALEN \nHe walks back along the trail, looking for Valerian. Pretty soon the rest of the travelers are out of sight. He hears the sound of a splash. He turns off the trail and pushes through some shrubbery. \nVALERIAN Ask my father. \nThey finish dressing in silence. Finally: \nGALEN The lottery! Daughters are chosen, but sons are not! \nVALERIAN That's right. Unless you have plenty of gold or property. \nGALEN What do you mean? \nVALERIAN If you're rich enough, your name never goes in. (bitter) My father is poor. So are a lot of fathers. \nHe studies her. She jams a hat down over her head and, once more the young man, stalks off. \nTHE VISION \nGalen walks down to the edge of the pool to retrieve his pack. As he leans over he catches sight of what appears to be a reflection in the water: Tyrian on horseback. He whips around, but no one is behind him. Riveted by the vision, he hurries along the bank to follow it. After a few paces the blurry figure dismounts, unslings a longbow, nocks an arrow and draws the string taut. \nGALEN (horrified) No! \nFOREST \nGalen sprints through the trees. Up ahead is Valerian, walking resolutely. \nGALEN No! \nShe glances back at him and grimly keeps on walking. Galen shoots past her and on into the forest. \nGALEN Hodge! \nTRAVELERS \nGalen races up the trail rounds a bend and sees the Urlanders coming toward him. Hodge precedes the group with an unsteady gait. He sees Galen, raises up his arms and flops face down on the trail. A long arrow protrudes from his back. Galen kneels beside him. The uneasy company keeps its distance. Hodge struggles to speak. \nHODGE Galen? Can you hear me? \nGALEN I hear you. \nHODGE You know, somebody shot me, but I can still talk. There's something that has to be done. \nGALEN I know. \nHODGE Not that cockatrice. Ulrich's ashes. Here. \nHodge's hand comes out from under his coat gripping the leather pouch. Galen tugs at it, but Hodge can't let go. \nHODGE Take it. Sorry, you'll have to peel it loose. \nGalen pries the sack out of Hodge's clenched fingers. Suddenly the hand comes up, grabs Galen by the hair, and pulls him near. \nHODGE (a croak) ...burning water... find the lake, throw it in... \nGALEN (holding up the pouch) What are you doing with this, Hodge? \nHODGE ...burning water... \nGREIL Look, you don't have to do this. We know you're a fine young magician. None better. There's no need to prove it to us. \nGALEN Are there other entrances? \nVALERIAN No. One's enough. \nGREIL Come on. The road's this way. We'll tell everybody how close you got. \nGALEN (coolly) No smoke. How do you know it's in there? \nGREIL Don't be a fool. Come away now and live to tell about it. \nInstead, Galen starts into the crack. Greil and Malkin hasten away, but Valerian lingers, watching in mounting frustration as Galen probes further and further into the lair. She picks up a fistful of stones and throws them at him. \nVALERIAN Go ahead! You're going to die! What a fine trick that will be! \nBut Galen is lost in the gloom. She flees. \nUNDERGROUND \nGalen puts his hand on the rugged wall: the rocks are hot to the touch. Something glinting on the floor catches Galen's eye: an irridescent disk, a dragon scale. It flashes the colors of the rainbow as Galen examines it. All at once the ground shudders; chunks of rock fall from the ceiling. A pall of smoke billows up from the depths. \nOUTSIDE \nGalen staggers out of the fissure coughing and gagging in a swirl of smoke. There is no sign of the Urlanders. He throws down his pack, climbs onto a huge boulder and surveys the massive cliffs rising behind the lair. He grasps the amulet and closes his eyes. \nGALEN Now, great mountain, hear my command: Terrae lapsus consignet latibulum draconis! Evanescat latibulum draconis! \nLANDSLIDE \nWith a thunderous splitting sound, the entire top of the cliff pitches forward and topples onto the lower half of the mountain, sweeping tons of debris into the air. Boulders the size of houses bound down the mountain toward the magician. Eyes wide with awe, he turns and runs for his life. Even as he careens down the slope, chunks of rock rumble past. One catches him at the knee and sends him flying. \nHe covers his head and joins the landslide. Finally the dust lifts and he finds himself in a gully face to face with the cowering Urlanders. They look with real fear at the man who just conjured up the Apocalypse. Tattered and torn, covered with dirt, Galen climbs up out of the shelter for a look at his handiwork. \nLANDSCAPE \nThe territory has been drastically transformed: the dragon's lair is now buried beneath hundreds of tons of broken granite. The Urlanders look upon the new landscape with stupefaction. Galen grins a triumphant split-lip grin that fails to win them over. Presently they back away and run off down the trail, Valerian in their midst. Galen's grin fades. \nCUT TO: \nVILLAGE - DAY \nThe Village of Swanscombe is little more than a rough and ready collection of thatched huts and mud-daubed outbuildings surrounded by cultivated fields. Dogs sleep in open door- ways; chickens peck around the communal well -- but there are no people in evidence as Valerian and her company troop into town. \nVALERIAN \nShe trots across the square and enters a deserted blacksmith shop. \nVALERIAN Father? Hello? \nShe goes over to the forge. Hot coals are burning. She becomes aware of a sound -- voices -- chanting. \nSQUARE \nShe walks across the square toward the voices. She is joined by Greil, Malkin and the other travelers, all of them puzzled by the desolation. As they approach the grange hall the voices grow louder. They seem to be singing. The main doors open briefly and three villagers scamper out, dripping wet and wrapped in white muslin. Valerian and her companions look at each other in astonishment. \nA procession of curious villagers winds its way into the badlands. They gather on a promontory overlooking the dragon's lair. They stand there for a long time, a chill wind whipping their garments, trying to understand what's happened. The monk is mightily displeased. \nBROTHER JACOPUS Praise God! Blessed is he that is humble before the Lord! \nVALERIAN Your god had nothing to do with it. \nIndeed, Galen's act is already the stuff of legend: \nMALKIN We saw it with our own eyes. He flew to the mountain top. He was a bird. He brought forth lightning. I saw it. \nSome of the younger villagers scamper forward to the spot where the cave had its opening. With yells and whoops they beat the ground with clubs. In the crowd Simon begins to smile, then to laugh. Soon he leads the villagers in a tumultuous cheer. Brother Jacopus and some of his converts drop to their knees and pray. \nCUT TO: \nCELEBRATION \nThe inhabitants of Swanscombe have decked out the town square and are making a night of it. By torchlight they dance merrily to jigs and reels provided by the local fiddlers. Ale flows freely from oak casks. \nVALERIAN'S HOUSE \nValerian is kneeling before a trunk full of women's clothing. She pulls out a long simple frock, goes to a crude mirror, and holds it up against her body to gauge the effect. Her father comes up behind her. He is angry and frightened. \nSIMON Put that away. What if you were seen? \nVALERIAN I'm going to be seen. I want to be seen. Tonight the world finds out that you never had a son. \nSIMON No, you mustn't do that. It's too soon. We've got to think about this, we've got to make a plan. \nVALERIAN Father: the danger is over. \nHe sits on the bed and puts his head in his hands. \nSIMON I know. What am I going to say to my friends who still mourn for their lost girls. \nVALERIAN You'll say you did what you had to. This is a time for celebration -- and forgiveness. \nHe looks up at her, trying to imagine what it's going to be like having a daughter. \nCELEBRATION \nGalen is surrounded by a crowd of wide-eyed kids and not a few adults, entertaining them by pulling duck's eggs out of their ears and causing coins to disappear. Presently he feels the attention of his audience shift away to someone standing behind him. He turns to find a shy but determined Valerian sweetly decked out in her blue frock. A buzz goes through the crowd. Valerian blushes and wavers: she seems ready to bolt for home. But Galen takes her by the hand, and with conspicuous politesse leads her to the dance. \nDANCE \nIt's forward, back and around sixth-century style: the young sorcerer can't take his eyes off his partner. But she's too shy to return his gaze. \nGALEN Looks like you've been up to a little sorcery yourself. \nValerian doesn't know what to say. \nGALEN Or is it witchcraft? \nShe still doesn't reply. It's all she can do to keep on dancing. \nGALEN What's the matter? A real woman never stops talking. \nCUT TO: \nTHRONE ROOM - DAY \nWithin the castle is a great hall with shafts of daylight poking in through narrow windows set high in the walls. In the middle of the room stands a carved oak throne. There is Casiodorus Rex, King of Urland, a bearded man in his fifties, as spare and somber as the room in which he sits. He is flanked by a few servants, assorted courtiers and Tyrian. Standing before them all is Galen, looking unhappy. He pours a pitcher full of water into a small glazed goblet. \nGALEN One of the best things about the water here in Urland is that there's so much of it -- look at that! \nWater continues to pour into the goblet without overflowing. Galen takes a sip. \nGALEN Mmm. Good. But not cold enough. Perhaps I could borrow a scarf from his Majesty. \nThe King makes no sign. Galen approaches stiffly, takes a scarf and retreats. \nGALEN I cover the goblet, so... remove, so... and behold: winter in a mug! \nAnd he's done it: he turns the goblet over and a small chunk of ice hits the floor. The royal reaction is equally frosty. Galen is bombing, and he knows it. \nGALEN All right. How many of you have ever seen a table fly? \nHe mutters an incantation. In the audience, Tyrian notes that Galen has his hand wrapped around the amulet. There is a loud clatter as the heavy oak table before the throne begins to jitter and buck. As the wine spills and plates go flying, the King wearily raises a hand. \nKING Enough! That's fine. \nGALEN Wait, it'll rise now. \nKING Don't bother. Not necessary. \nThe table cracks in half and dumps a mess of fruit and crockery at the onlookers' feet. \nKING Tell me: the landslide -- it was accomplished this same way? \nGALEN Yes. \nKING I see. And having rendered such unique service to our kingdom, what would you claim as a reward? \nGALEN Please -- no payment. I have always found magical practice to be its own reward. I seek only some yet greater challenge. \nThis handsome sentiment doesn't go over any better than his tricks. \nKING Did you ever hear of King Gaiseric? Of course not, you weren't even born. He was my brother, a great King and a valiant man-at-arms. When he ascended to the throne, the dragon was unbridled. No one knew where it might strike next. So he brought forth his broadsword and his spear, assembled a company of his best fighters and went out to do battle. (pause) He was never seen again. But his attack provoked the most terrible reprisals: whole villages incinerated, entire crops burned. Death, famine, horrible. \nThe King grimaces as the memories come flooding back. \nKING (quietly) How did you arrogate to yourself the role of savior? \nGALEN I was invited. \nKING Not by me. Did you ever consider the consequences of failure? \nGALEN What failure? What's the matter with you people? You want the dragon back? \nKING Then the beast is dead? \nGALEN Yes, of course. Dead. \nGALEN Virgin? \nELSPETH Maiden. \nGALEN If you say so. \nELSPETH What do you mean? \nGALEN (sighs) Nothing. \nELSPETH I've participated in every drawing since I came of age. \nGALEN Maybe. \nELSPETH It's true. You don't believe me. You think I'm lying. Well I'm not. \nGALEN I'm sorry. I heard a rumor. Families with money, that sort of thing. \nELSPETH Don't listen to rumors. They're lies. I have to go now. \nGALEN Wait -- how long do I have to stay in here? \nELSPETH Until we know. Not long. Goodbye. Vale. Dormi bene. \nShe slips away down the corridor. \nLIBRARY \nKing Casiodorus and Tyrian are huddled over a table piled high with manuscripts and papers. Tyrian clears a spot and sets out a stack of lead bars. \nKING That's enough. Let's not be greedy here. \nThe King picks up Galen's amulet, and holds it over the bars in his clenched fist. \nKING Now then: I, Casiodorus Rex do hereby command thou base metal to change thy essence and become gold. \nThere is a rustle of skirts and Elspeth appears behind him. \nELSPETH Father? \nKING Not now. Tyrian, remove all but one bar. We'll try it one at a time. \nELSPETH Father: did you know that some families have paid bribes to stay out of the lottery? \nThe King and Tyrian glance up at her. \nKING Nonsense. By the power of this amulet, justly wielded by my hand in accordance with the laws of Urland, now lead be thou gold. \nThe lead remains unchanged, but the King gives out a cry and drops the amulet. \nKING I'm burned! What devilish thing is this? \nELSPETH Have you ever kept my name off the lottery list? \nKING That'll be all, Tyrian. You may withdraw. \nTYRIAN There! Stop him! \nGalen rides like mad for the exit, but he's a half-second late: the doors boom shut in his face. He wheels the horse around. The King's men are coming toward him with pikes. Digging his heels into the horse's sides, he urges the animal back across the courtyard, up the steps and right into the building! \nTHRONE ROOM \nGalen gallops into the empty chamber, knocking over the throne and vaulting a table. Hot on his heels are armed soldiers. He kicks the horse again and shoots under an archway. \nKITCHEN \nThe kitchen is already in chaos from the earthquake when Galen charges in on his wild steed. Food, utensils and cooks go flying. He reins in, ducks his head, and squeezes the horse out into a narrow hallway. \nHALLWAY \nHe clatters down the passageway. But here comes a contingent of footmen from the opposite direction. Galen rides them into the walls! \nSTAIRS \nThe horse scrabbles up the stairs, Galen tucked low against its neck. On the upper landing he comes face to face with Tyrian and more soldiers. \nTYRIAN Get him! Stab the horse! \nGalen jerks the animal around and plunges back down the stairs. \nLIBRARY \nWhinnying and blowing the horse bursts in, a wild-eyed Galen still in the saddle. He finds himself confronting the King and his daughter. \nCasiodorus grabs Elspeth and retreats into a corner. \nKING Tyrian! Tyrian! \nTyrian sweeps in with his men. The doors slam shut. \nKING So much for your magic! So much for your sorcery! \nGalen is trapped. Just as Tyrian reaches for the horse's reins, the animal rears up, rolling its eyes. At that moment the floor heaves and cracks in a new series of shocks. The men at arms go down like ten pins. Tyrian reels back, dodging stone blocks loosened from the ceiling. As the shaking continues, a weakened section of wall gives way. Galen sees daylight! Without even waiting for the quake to cease, he prods the horse across the room and through the wall to freedom. \nCUT TO: \nDRAGON COUNTRY - DAY \nThe unnerved citizens of Swanscombe gather on the promontory overlooking Galen's landslide. Every few seconds there is a new shudder and more rocks pour down the long slope. Valerian stands trembling with her father. Presently Brother Jacopus elbows his way forward. \nBROTHER JACOPUS Listen to me, my brethren. The moment of our fear is the moment of our triumph. This is a sign from God. Follow me, and our faith will send this creature straight to hell. \nHolding a cross before him, he starts up the slope. No one follows. They haven't been Christians all that long. One or two near Valerian get down on their knees and pray silently. Greil looks things over. \nGREIL You call yourselves Christians? \nHe strides after the monk. But he's the only one. \nNEAR THE LAIR \nThe determined monk has arrived at the epicenter. His sandals are smoking on the hot gravel. Sweat shines on his face and neck. \nGALEN I can't do it. \nVALERIAN (this stops her) What? Why not? \nGalen's hand moves up to where the amulet used to hang. \nGALEN I just can't. \nVALERIAN But you're a sorcerer. \nGALEN I'm no sorcerer. Whatever power I might have had, it's gone. \nVALERIAN It can't be! \nGALEN I know: I'm an imposter. A fraud. A fake. I'm sorry... \nFor a moment, Valerian is too stunned to speak. Then her face colors. \nVALERIAN You're sorry?! Listen to that! The damn thing is loose, we're all on fire and you're sorry! \nGalen sinks to the floor and sits in the ashes. \nVALERIAN You didn't have the faintest idea what you were doing, did you? You're a fool -- and I'm a bigger one for bringing you here. \nShe snatches up a pitchfork and glowers at him. \nVALERIAN I don't want you in this house. Get out. \nBut Galen still sits there like a puppet with its strings cut, every dream of glory utterly crushed. This piteous sight touches Valerian's heart. Her gaze softens. She slowly lowers the pitchfork. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nTOWN SQUARE - DAY \nA knot of villagers lead Tyrian and his henchmen across the square directly to the blacksmith's shop. The King's men dismount and pound on the door. It swings open. Valerian is standing there. \nTYRIAN Where is he? \nVALERIAN Not here. I can't help you. \nA cry goes up from the villagers. They know damn well he's in there. \nVALERIAN'S HOUSE \nTyrian pushes Valerian aside and steps into the room. Aided by some townfolk, his men proceed to ransack the premises, overturning barrels, sticking their swords through flour sacks, poking through the tumbledown thatch. Valerian's eye falls on Malkin, who has involved himself in the search. \nVALERIAN You too? \nMALKIN (returning her look) Damn right. \nFinding nothing, the group pushes into the metal shop, where Simon is hammering an iron wheel rim back into shape on an enormous anvil. He lays down his tools and grimly watches the men go through, overturning benches and tables. Tyrian props a leg up on the anvil and addresses himself to Simon. \nTYRIAN As the proud new father of an eligible daughter who was some-how overlooked all these years, it may interest you to know that the King has called for a new lottery. \nSIMON Don't do that! (he looks at Valerian) Girl-child, when you were born I knew I had to do something, so I set about the task of fashioning an extraordinary weapon: I had the skill to make it -- (bleak pause) -- but not the nerve to use it. \nShe looks at him with affection. Leaning forward, she plants a kiss on his bald pate. \nVALERIAN I'm thankful for that. (to Galen) No man should choose a senseless death. \nCUT TO: \nSTREAM - DAY \nGalen, Valerian and Simon tramp through a glade to a mossy bank. There a wide stream flows lazily under a canopy of trees. \nVALERIAN If it's me you're worried about, don't. So my name has been entered, what of it? There are hundreds of girls. My name just won't be drawn. I know it won't. \nGalen walks out into the shallows and pushes the sword-tip into the sandy bottom, angled so that the edge splits the current. \nGALEN Valerian, this isn't just for your sake. \nHe walks back to shore. All three watch the sword to see what will happen. \nSWORD \nBig flat oak leaves are gliding along the current. Very slowly, they go by the sword, some of them very close. Finally, one of them floats against the leading edge of the blade and without a ripple is cleft in two. Simon gives Galen a significant look. \nVALERIAN I don't care. It doesn't matter. What you want to kill isn't flesh and blood. \nSIMON Oh, it'll bleed, all right. \nVALERIAN How do you know? No one's so much as even scratched it. \nThey look to Galen. The apprentice's face is full of doubt. \nGALEN I'll need the amulet. \nCUT TO: \nKING'S CASTLE - NIGHT \nCarrying torches to light their way, families -- some with maiden daughters -- gather from all over the country in the courtyard of the King's castle. Simon is there with Valerian, and so is Galen, disguised in rough farm clothes and a wide- brimmed hat. Like many others, he carries a stick topped with a bleached skull -- to all appearances, just another participant in this weird pagan ritual. A barrel decorated with flames and dragon's wings sits on a raised dais in front of the main entrance. Horsrik, the King's herald, supervises preparations for the lottery. Armed guards appear carrying a sealed chest. Horsrik breaks the seal and the guards pour the contents -- hundreds of wooden tiles, each bearing the name of a potential sacrifice -- into the barrel. Trumpets blare and drums roll and the royal party strolls onstage: the King, his daughter, courtiers and Tyrian. Valerian nudges Galen. \nVALERIAN (pointing) Look at her. The Princess. \nGALEN I know. We've met. \nValerian gives Galen a sharp look. Horsrik unrolls a parchment. \nHORSRIK (reading) People of Urland: whereas the peace of the kingdom has been disrupted by the mischief of an interloper; and whereas this interloper being fled; now therefore, his majesty the King hereby proclaims the sum of thirty ducats to be paid to anyone producing the miscreant Galen Bradwardyn, fraud enchanter, to our satisfaction. \nGalen pulls his hat low over his eyes. As the moment for the drawing approaches, Valerian becomes more and more uneasy. She pushes forward through the crowd until she's just below the barrel. She eyes the people around her. Some of them seem equally worried, others -- the better dressed and better fed -- are smug and complacent. The King and his retinue are serene. A chant goes up from the crowd: \nCROWD Stir the tiles! Stir the tiles! \nHorsrik picks up a wooden staff surmounted by a carved dragon's head and stirs up the names. This done, a new chant goes up: \nCROWD Bare the arm! Bare the arm! \nGalen can hear the voices in the courtyard as he rushes down a hall. Suddenly he stops short. There in front of him is a guard leaning out a window to watch the proceedings. Galen hovers on the verge of panic as the guard abruptly moves. But the man is only headed for another window and a better view. Galen manages to fall into step an arm's length behind him and slip by without a sound. \nLIBRARY \nGalen enters the library, his enormous shadow dancing crazily on the torchlit walls. Hurrying through, his attention is drawn to some open books on a table. Closer inspection reveals magical writings and symbols. Galen paws over everything, suddenly aware that he must be close to the amulet. But where is it? \nCOURTYARD \nAs the crowd disperses Valerian watches Elspeth walk back in the castle, lofty and composed. She looks for Galen and discovers he has gone. \nLIBRARY \nBy now, the room is in total disarray. Galen has opened all the chests and trunks and knocked half the books from the shelves. No amulet. He's feverishly working on a locked drawer when a voice interrupts him. \nKING Don't go to all that trouble. \nGalen whirls around to find the King standing in the doorway. The monarch looks shattered. Galen edges toward the split in the wall and finds that it has been shored up with timbers. At that moment Tyrian comes through the door, sizes up the situation and draws his sword. \nGALEN I'm unarmed. If you want a fight, at least give me a weapon. \nTYRIAN (pushing by the King) I think not! \nKING Stop! Don't harm him. (to Galen) And you -- don't run away... please... \nThe King's voice is cracking. Galen and Tyrian are equally taken aback. The King searches through the books remaining on the library shelves. \nKING (shaky) I've always had the greatest admiration for the black arts. You chaps with your mysterious spells... I didn't think it would be necessary, you see. Vermithrax is an old dragon. And that, I thought, was the beauty of my plan -- buying time. We'd wait her out. I'd live to see the end of her. (firm) That's still going to happen. \nThe King finds the book and takes the amulet out. With trembling hands, he passes it to Galen. \nTYRIAN Sire! \nKING He shall have it. (pleading) It's my daughter. Save her, I beg you. \nCUT TO: \nVILLAGE - DAY \nThe people of Swanscombe are clearing up the rubble and beginning repairs on their dwellings. Standing in their midst, lecturing every passerby, is Greil. He holds up the charred remains of Brother Jacopus' wooden cross. \nGREIL Holy of holies -- he did not die in vain. Can you hear me, brothers? \nSome workmen go by lugging new thatch. Malkin is with them. \nMALKIN (gently) We hear you, Greil. \nGREIL Well and good, but I'm Greil no longer. Call me Gregorius, after the Bishop of Rome. \nMalkin and the others stop to listen. \nGREIL I saw him die. Like Our Lord Jesus on the cross he was, scourged by evil. But he showed no fear. Such is the power of the Holy Ghost. \nBLACKSMITH SHOP \nGalen lurks in the shadows of Simon's metal shop looking out on the square where Greil is holding forth. \nShe shudders. Galen's eyes are still fastened on her. She's fighting to retain her hard manner, but the agitation and dread are plain. \nGALEN Hatchlings. They'll have to be killed too. Anything else? \nValerian wants to be bold, but on this final point, can't muster the courage. \nVALERIAN (tiny voice) You're in love, aren't you? \nGALEN (slowly nodding) Yes. \nVALERIAN That's all right. I understand. She's very beautiful, very brave. \nGALEN Who is? What do you mean? \nVALERIAN Your Princess. But I don't care. It doesn't change the way I feel. (firm) Listen to me, Galen Bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice; you're going to be dead, the dragon will be worse than ever, there will be more lotteries, and I'm not a boy any more. \nGALEN And you'll be eligible because -- \nVALERIAN Because I'm still a virgin, and I want you to do something about it. \nGalen takes her in his arms; she is trembling. He tilts her face up toward his and kisses her. \nGALEN I am in love. But not with the Princess. \nTheir image is reflected in the waters. Through the ripples she is visible pulling briefly away to remove her clothes. \nFrom afar, they are two tiny figures under the overarching oaks and willows. They embrace and sink down into the deep grass beside the water. The leaves continue their unhurried course downstream. \nCUT TO: \nDRAGON COUNTRY - NIGHT \nA cold wind whistles through the rocks near the dragon's lair. By the light of a flickering torch two workmen finish driving a heavy post into the ground. As they affix a pair of iron manacles they see the torches of a procession coming up the slope. They hurry down to meet it. Horsrik is in the lead, followed by soldiers and royal attendants. Elspeth rides in the tumbril behind a blindfolded horse. Bringing up the rear is Tyrian. At last the cart can go no further. Elspeth alights and leads the rest of the troop to the post. As the soldiers put the irons around her wrists, Horsrik unrolls a parchment, turns his back on the wind and begins to read: \nHORSRIK Now be it known throughout the kingdom, that the Princess, having been chosen by a deed of fortune and destiny -- \nHorsrik blinks. There's a black stain growing in the middle of the parchment; all at once it bursts into flames. He cries out and flings the document away. There follows a flash of light and a puff of smoke and Galen is standing there, as if he had materialized out of thin air. Horsrik and his startled men backpedal down the slope. \nHORSRIK No fire, I beg you. \nGalen raises his hands in a menacing gesture. \nGALEN Be gone! \nThat's enough for Horsrik and company: he and the soldiers depart. \nHORSRIK (over his shoulder) I declare these proceedings duly ordained... \nOnly one man remains behind the challenge the young sorcerer: Tyrian. He draws his sword. \nTYRIAN I knew I'd find you here. Well, I'm not as sentimental as some. The kingdom, every one of us, need this sacrifice. If you intend to interfere, you'll have to kill me. \nGALEN I've got plenty of reasons to kill you that have nothing to do with this sacrifice. \nGalen draws his own sword. As it emerges into the night air it seems imbued with a blue phosphorescence. \nCUT TO: \nDAWN \nValerian roams the rock-strewn slope not far from the dragon's lair. Presently she comes upon a once-familiar object -- the fire shield. Half the scales are gone, the rest are charred and curling. Grimly, she moves on. A few paces away she picks up the blunted sword. She scans the rocks and finally sees what she's looking for. \nGALEN \nHe's lying face down behind a boulder, his clothes charred, patches of skin scorched. He looks dead. Valerian rolls him onto his back. She gasps: the eyes are open, regarding her. \nGALEN Still alive. \nCUT TO: \nBLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY \nSimon is standing by the anvil with the broken sword in his hand, lost in thought. \nHOUSE \nIn the adjoining house Valerian tends Galen's wounds. He's propped up on a palette enduring the application of poultices. \nVALERIAN You know what we have to do. (he looks at her with dull eyes) We have to leave Urland. \nHe winces in pain. \nVALERIAN Not because of what happened. I brought you here -- it didn't work -- now I'm taking you away. Do you understand? (Galen does not react) You said you loved me. Is it true? If it is, it's the only good we've done. Let's not lose that too. (pause) Galen? \nHe seems miles away. She turns aside, on the verge of tears. Simon is standing there, still holding the sword hilt. \nSIMON She's right. What kind of a life could you have here? It's too late for me, but you're young enough. (he shows them the sword) You know what I think? Magic is dying out, fading from the world. But that makes me happy. That means the dragon will be dying too. \nGalen looks at him; he has heard everything. He sits up and fondly regards Valerian. \nPACKING \nValerian packs her belongings into a rucksack. The last item in is her blue frock, carefully rolled. Beside her, Galen dons clean traveling clothes. He stiffly crosses the room and drags his pack out of the corner. He sorts through the effects, and amidst the clothing and supplies discovers the leather pouch containing Ulrich's remains. He contemplates it. \nVALERIAN What's that? \nGALEN Nothing. I was just thinking -- poor Hodge. \nHe tucks the pouch away, throws some clothes on top and ties the satchel shut. \nCUT TO: \nSTREAM - DAY \nBeside the quiet stream Simon bids farewell to the young couple, embracing each in turn. They slosh across the shallow water and follow a path into the woods. \nCUT TO: \nVILLAGE SQUARE - DAY \nGreil is standing outside the half-burned grange hall, summoning the Christian faithful. He proclaims the call to worship by hammering on a small bell. One by one the townsfolk arrive. Among them is Simon, looking bereft. \nValerian wrestles the amulet away from Galen. It falls to the ground. \nVALERIAN You heard what he said. \nShe lifts the chunk of stone. Galen grabs for it. \nGALEN No! You can't! \nTHE LAST ATTACK \nVermithrax spirals up into the storm, then drops earthward. Ulrich watches as the beast comes straight at him. He folds his arms and bows his head. Leathery wings humming, the creature levels out, swoops up past the crag and lifts the master magician away in its huge hind claw. \nULRICH Galen! \nGalen and Valerian are horrified to see the dragon circling upward with the sorcerer writhing in agony in its grip. As the monstrous thing flies high over them, they can hear Ulrich's faint screams. \nDEATH \nNow Galen understands. He seizes the granite block from Valerian and raises it with both hands over his head. He takes a final look at the amulet, glowing at his feet, then brings the rock down with all his might. There is a blinding flash as it shatters into a million fragments. \nFar above there is another blinding flash as Ulrich's earthly body explodes against the belly of the beast. The darkened sky lights up as huge gouts of flame spew forth from the dragon's gut. Wings fluttering uselessly, this reptilian torch plummets to the ground. \nLAKE \nBelow, a stock pond nestled in the foothill pastures. Trailing a wake of flame, Vermithrax plunges like a comet into the water. There is a stupendous splash and eruption of steam. \nGALEN & VALERIAN \nThey stare down from their lofty perch, watching as further explosions boil the water from the pond. \nECLIPSE \nBehind a tattered wrack of cloud, the moon slowly uncovers a pale sun. \nDISSOLVE: \nTHE CARCASS - DAY \nGrey misty light reveals the beast's mangled remains. Galen and Valerian emerge from the fog, walk under a blackened wing and make their way through the mud and loose scales to the huge charred head. The death agony has twisted it upside down. The mouth is frozen in a grotesque look of surprise. The eyes are glazed. Now the sound of voices floats toward them, chanting an ancient hymn. A moment later a mob of Christians, led by Greil, crests a hill and moves toward the hulk. The song ends. \nGREIL Let us pray. \nThe members of the congregation fall to their knees. \nGREIL We thank thee, Lord, for this divine deliverance. Verily is thy presence amongst us, fully manifest in this, thy great work. \nGalen and Valerian look at each other. She takes his hand. \nGREIL Arise, children of the Lord and forsake evermore the pagan mysteries. Rejoice in the true power of the Christian God! \nGalen turns and leads Valerian away. They disappear into the mist. \nDISSOLVE: \nFLENSING - DAY \n", "test1_input": "\"DRAGONSLAYER\" \nScreenplay by \nHal Barwood and Matthew Robbins \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nCASTLE - NIGHT \nNow comes the moon riding over the horizon. Upon a hill at the edge of the wood squats a castle, its crude stonework bathed in cold silvery light. Queer carvings and runes decorate the ponderous gate. Heavy vines are climbing up the walls. The castle is old, its unfamiliar form testament to an ancient mind and an ancient craft. Flickering candle light dances on a leaded windowpane. \nInside, the corridors are dark and silent. Under low arched ceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks. Perched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons with strange animal heads. \nHODGE \nA sleep on a straw palette in a room strewn with vegetables and crockery is Hodge, a wrinkled old retainer. A flickering candle and empty jug are beside the bed. He is snoring gently. \nCONJURING ROOM \nThis circular chamber at the heart of the castle is stuffed with parchments, scrolls, dusty books, bronze braziers, glass retorts, chemical salts, birds both stuffed and caged. An iron candelabra stands on a work table, tapers burning. In the soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied, but no, moving in the background is a shadowy figure, preparing for a magical deed. Feet are positioned carefully within a pentagram chiseled into the floor. A scroll is consulted; up comes an arm and a voice blurts out: \nVOICE Omnia in duos: Duo in Unum: Unus in Nihil: Haec nec Quattuor nec Omnia nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt. \nNothing happens. \nVOICE Come on, candles, out! \nBut the little flames stand at attention without so much as a tremble. \nVOICE In Volunta Divina et Verbum Magi: Lux! Exstinguat! \nIt's no use. There is a sigh and the figure moves forward into the light. Revealed in the glow is the discouraged face of Galen Bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice. \nTOWER \nCarrying the candelabra, the youth trudges up a circular staircase. \nTURRET \nThe highest point of the castle is a turret, open to the stars and the night air. Here, more magic is afoot. An old enchanter, Ulrich, Magister Ipsissimus, pours water from a silver ewer into a stone bowl. As the surface ripples disappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool. All at once his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams and thunder reach his ears. Lights and shadows, reflected from within the basin, play across his face. His frown deepens as the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in the water -- Draco draconis -- suddenly squelched by the roar of flame and an ugly snarl. \nAt that moment Galen reaches the top of the steps and holds up the candelabra. \nGALEN Vide, Magister. There's something wrong. \nUlrich, startled from his trance, slaps the water out of the basin and turns to confront his student. Galen is taken aback by the old man's grim countenance. \nGALEN What's the matter? What's happened? \nULRICH I've just seen something. Something of consequence to you. \nGALEN To me? \n", "test1_true": "With a distracted gesture he causes the flames to extinguish themselves. \nULRICH Perhaps we had better hasten your training. \nCUT TO: \nBARNYARD - DAY \nOutside the castle wall Hodge is feeding the chickens and ducks. He straightens up and squints through the early morning mists. On a distant hillock two figures are moving toward the woods. \nULRICH AND GALEN \nHobbling slowly with the aid of a pair of canes, Ulrich guides his pupil across a wooden bridge and along a stream into the forest. \nULRICH (stern and troubled) This wood, these leaves, the birds, the very dome of heaven, once they all rang with one great chord: and philosophers like me kept it all in tune. Now, new voices are singing new songs. (sharply) Have you mastered the threefold transmutation? \nGALEN Of course. \nULRICH (skeptical) You have? \nGALEN Well, almost. \nULRICH It's very difficult. Have you committed to memory undying the Codex de Profundis? \nGALEN (a shrug) The first two chapters. \nULRICH It's long. And what about the Ritual of Banishment as prescribed by my late master Balisarius? \nGALEN To tell the truth, I haven't dared try it. What's the point, anyway? \nULRICH The point? The point is you don't know it, and you're no magician without it. It was my hope to school you, to mold your faculties and wits... I still believe you have some talent. Somewhere. \nGALEN I hate books. I hate drill. I want a real task. \nULRICH There's no time now. When I'm gone, half the powers in the universe will vanish with me. And what's the use of a few lingering skills if they're left in the hands of a child? (pause) Listen! \nGALEN I don't hear anything. \nUlrich gauges the young man standing before him and makes a decision. Reaching under his cloak he lifts off a fine silver chain with an amulet dangling from it. He drapes it around Galen's neck. \nULRICH Here, wear this. \nGalen instinctively wraps his hand around the jewel. He cocks an ear. \nGALEN Voices, singing on the road. \nHe hastens forward to a promontory, eager to have a look. Ulrich does not follow. Instead, doffing his cloak, he whirls it before him, where it magically floats a few feet off the ground. Awkwardly, the old man clambers aboard. \nGALEN I don't see anything. \nHe turns back, but the wizard is gone. A shadow falls over him. He looks up. There, two hundred feet above the tree tops his master is soaring on the wind. \nAIRBORNE \nThe old conjurer squints into the distance. Miles away and far below a company of drab walkers winds along the margins of the forest. They are singing a mournful round. \n", "test2_input": "DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY \nGalen bounds up the rocky slope as fast as he can manage, trailed by a desperate Valerian. \nVALERIAN Galen, stop! Please, I beg you! \nBut Galen pays no attention. In a burst of speed and fury, Valerian comes up behind and tackles him. \nVALERIAN Stop! I won't let you kill yourself. \nGalen waves the leather pouch in Valerian's face. \nGALEN He couldn't walk -- he knew he couldn't make the journey. So he had us make the journey for him! Don't you see? \nHe jumps up and runs to the mouth of the lair. \nVALERIAN (pursuing) No! \nShe tackles him again. \nVALERIAN All right, all right. You're going in there, I'm going too. \nGALEN (brought up short) What? Why? No you're not, this is my job. Absolutely not. \nBut Valerian springs to her feet and starts into the lair. \nVALERIAN I'm not afraid. And you're not going to stop me. After all -- I've been a man longer than you have. \nGalen pauses long enough to snatch up a discarded torch near the remains of the wooden stake, then charges after her. \nUNDERGROUND \nRunning footsteps resound in the steamy passageway and Galen comes around the corner holding his torch high to light the way. Valerian stumbles after him. He grabs her hand. \nGALEN Stay close. \nDown and down they go. Soon they reach Elspeth's body. \nVALERIAN What's that? \nGALEN Never mind. Come on. \nBut she pulls the torch from his hand and goes over to see. \nGALEN All right. Wait here. \nHe darts off. In the flickering torchlight Valerian can see the Princess' remains all too clearly. She suppresses a scream. \nVALERIAN Galen? Galen? Where are you? \nNo answer. The torch reveals several passages. She doesn't know which one to take. \nLAKE OF FIRE \nThe passage widens out and once again Galen is standing on the shores of the lake of fire. He looks around. The water is rolling with bubbles of gas, and flames run hither and yon across the surface, but there is no sign of the dragon. Gathering his courage, he hops across the stepping stones to the middle of the lake. There he hurriedly opens the pouch. \n", "test2_true": "Gripping the amulet with his free hand, he scatters Ulrich's ashes in a wide arc over the burning water. Instantly, there is an ominous rumble and the earth gives a shrug. But no wizard appears. No dragon, either. There follows another and stronger quake. Galen crouches to keep his balance. Still no wizard. \nOUTSIDE \nThoroughly bewildered, Valerian stumbles out into daylight. She wanders a few yards down the slope and collapses against the stake. Something is strange: it's getting dark. Squinting up at the sun, she frowns in puzzlement, then gapes at what is happening. \nECLIPSE \nSlowly and ponderously the black disk of the moon slides over the face of the sun, plunging the world into crepuscular half-light. \nCUT TO: \nGRANGE HALL - DAY \nThe congregation is confused and frightened by the sudden darkness. \nGREIL Be calm. He watcheth over us! And this is His sign! Let us pray! Our Father who art in heaven... \nThe faithful bow their heads and join in. Simon as well. \nCUT TO: \nLAKE OF FIRE \nThe earthquakes have subsided; the water is calm. Galen stares bleakly into the flames. As he watches, they gather themselves into a lazy spiral. Gradually the spiral speeds up and becomes a vortex. Now the flames become tinged with green, and as the cavern moans with the sound of rushing air, a form takes shape at the crest of a jet of flame. It is Ulrich, supine as upon his pyre, reforming before Galen's eyes. \nGALEN Ulrich! Magister! Over here! I can see you! Over here! \nULRICH (looks at him) Not so loud. I'm not deaf, you know. \nHe slowly raises himself into an upright posture and strides through the flames. \nULRICH Sic redit magus ex terra mortis. \nThe apprentice throws himself at his master's feet. \nGALEN Wonder of wonders -- you're back! I thank the powers that made me! \nULRICH Glad to see you, too. You didn't bring along anything to eat, by any chance? \nGALEN Food? \nULRICH No? Oh well, no time anyway. \nOUTSIDE \nValerian is standing in the unearthly twilight, anxiously peering into the mouth of the lair. Suddenly she is hit from behind by a gust of wind. She does not turn to see the enormous Vermithrax alighting silently behind her. \nGALEN & ULRICH \nUlrich raises Galen to his feet. \nULRICH Come along. There's much to be done. \nGALEN Wait, I have something to tell you. \n", "test3_input": "ULRICH It can wait. \nGALEN No it can't. Listen: I thought I was a sorcerer -- but I wasn't. I thought I had power -- but I didn't. I thought I was you -- but I'm not. \nHe hangs his head. Ulrich regards him steadily. \nULRICH Well said. Now hurry. \nHe leads the way across the rocks to the shore and into the tunnel. \nVALERIAN \nTime seems to have come to a stop. Overhead, the moon is locked in front of the sun. At the lair, Valerian stands frozen as the dragon leans over her. The great head sways from side to side. The jaws hinge open. Suddenly, Valerian recovers herself and makes a run for it, leaping and scrabbling over the rocks. A plume of flame licks at her heels. She sees a protective crevice and heads for it, but a winged claw drops to block her way. She changes direction and is cut off again. Cat and mouse. \nVERMITHRAX \nThe pale yellow eyes stare implacably down at the hopeless victim. The igniter jets come on, then off, as the beast suddenly stiffens. The head rotates, almost as if catching a new scent. Finally the eyes focus on the entrance to the cavern. \nULRICH \nThere is the sorcerer, leaning on Galen, coolly regarding the creature. The old man's expression hardens. \nULRICH Draco draconis... \nThe dragon lifts its wings as if to menace them, then flaps twice and is airborne. The thing shoots overhead and, with a rush of wind, flies off into the gloom. \nIN THE ROCKS \nValerian struggles out of her hiding place. \nVALERIAN Galen! \nGalen runs to her. They embrace. When they look up, Ulrich is at their side. \nULRICH Where's my amulet? Give it to me, please. \nGalen's hand locates the jewel under his shirt. He finds himself reluctant to part with it. \nWith a hurricane howl, a column of flame touches down nearby and rushes toward them. They stagger back as the dragon sweeps past. \nULRICH Be quick! \nGalen hands his treasure over. Ulrich closes his hand around it. \nULRICH Come close to me. \nGalen and Valerian approach. The old man's hand is suffused with an internal glow. Behind them, the dragon is turning for another pass. \nVORTEX \nAll at once the glow brightens, and in another instant the world spins off into a blur, setting all three afloat in a timeless netherworld. Valerian and Galen cling to each other in terror. \nULRICH Don't be afraid. You have served me with great courage. Now you must show me you have even more. \nGALEN Anything! \n", "test3_true": "ULRICH You must destroy the amulet, and me along with it. \nGALEN No! \nULRICH You brought me from the flames, you must send me back. \nGALEN I can't. \nULRICH When the time comes, you'll understand. Here. \nHe dangles the amulet in front of Galen. Even more reluctantly than he let it go, he takes it back. \nMOUNTAIN TOP \nAbruptly, the vortex is gone and they find themselves atop a rocky crag overlooking the eclipse-darkened fields and farms of Urland. Galen glances at his surroundings and stares at the amulet, full of awe. \nULRICH I know what you're thinking. You have learned much and done well. Don't worry, you won't need it any more. \nCUT TO: \nGRANGE HALL - DAY \nGreil is urging Simon, the last of the converts, into the cistern. \nGREIL Make haste, brother. \nHe dips Simon's head under water. \nGREIL Now be thou baptized in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. May the Lord our God light our way. \nIn the background, half the congregation is staring through the burned-out walls, fervently praying and crossing themselves, wondering if they'll ever see the sun again. A cry goes up: a shape crosses the solar corona, wheels over the village and streaks away toward the mountains -- the dragon. \nCUT TO: \nMOUNTAIN TOP \nGalen and Valerian peer out from behind a boulder and watch Ulrich hobble perilously close to the edge of the cliff. The old man spreads wide his arms and tilts his head back. \nULRICH Nimbus! Tempestas! Fulmen! \nFrom over the horizon roiling inky-black clouds churn down upon them. Thunder booms and echoes. A bitter wind whips their clothing. As the storm gathers fury, the dragon reappears, circling in the distance. Finally it homes in on the mountain crag and dives at Ulrich. The conjurer makes a gesture and strokes of lightning explode against the beast's scaly flanks. It emits a high thin scream and rockets past. \nGALEN & VALERIAN \nValerian crawls away and comes back with a hefty chunk of granite. \nVALERIAN Here. Do as he said. Smash it. \nGALEN Not if it means killing him. \nULRICH \nHe resolutely waits as the dragon banks against the clouds and starts another pass. Again, the sorcerer summons lightning bolts. But the dragon keeps coming; this time a talon splits the old man's cape. \nGALEN & VALERIAN \n"}

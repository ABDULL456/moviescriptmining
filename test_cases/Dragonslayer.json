{"test1_input": "\"DRAGONSLAYER\" \nScreenplay by \nHal Barwood and Matthew Robbins \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nFADE IN: \nCASTLE - NIGHT \nNow comes the moon riding over the horizon. Upon a hill at the edge of the wood squats a castle, its crude stonework bathed in cold silvery light. Queer carvings and runes decorate the ponderous gate. Heavy vines are climbing up the walls. The castle is old, its unfamiliar form testament to an ancient mind and an ancient craft. Flickering candle light dances on a leaded windowpane. \nInside, the corridors are dark and silent. Under low arched ceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks. Perched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons with strange animal heads. \nHODGE \nA sleep on a straw palette in a room strewn with vegetables and crockery is Hodge, a wrinkled old retainer. A flickering candle and empty jug are beside the bed. He is snoring gently. \nCONJURING ROOM \nThis circular chamber at the heart of the castle is stuffed with parchments, scrolls, dusty books, bronze braziers, glass retorts, chemical salts, birds both stuffed and caged. An iron candelabra stands on a work table, tapers burning. In the soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied, but no, moving in the background is a shadowy figure, preparing for a magical deed. Feet are positioned carefully within a pentagram chiseled into the floor. A scroll is consulted; up comes an arm and a voice blurts out: \nVOICE Omnia in duos: Duo in Unum: Unus in Nihil: Haec nec Quattuor nec Omnia nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt. \nNothing happens. \nVOICE Come on, candles, out! \nBut the little flames stand at attention without so much as a tremble. \nVOICE In Volunta Divina et Verbum Magi: Lux! Exstinguat! \nIt's no use. There is a sigh and the figure moves forward into the light. Revealed in the glow is the discouraged face of Galen Bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice. \nTOWER \nCarrying the candelabra, the youth trudges up a circular staircase. \nTURRET \nThe highest point of the castle is a turret, open to the stars and the night air. Here, more magic is afoot. An old enchanter, Ulrich, Magister Ipsissimus, pours water from a silver ewer into a stone bowl. As the surface ripples disappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool. All at once his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams and thunder reach his ears. Lights and shadows, reflected from within the basin, play across his face. His frown deepens as the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in the water -- Draco draconis -- suddenly squelched by the roar of flame and an ugly snarl. \nAt that moment Galen reaches the top of the steps and holds up the candelabra. \nGALEN Vide, Magister. There's something wrong. \nUlrich, startled from his trance, slaps the water out of the basin and turns to confront his student. Galen is taken aback by the old man's grim countenance. \nGALEN What's the matter? What's happened? \nULRICH I've just seen something. Something of consequence to you. \nGALEN To me? \n", "test1_true": "With a distracted gesture he causes the flames to extinguish themselves. \nULRICH Perhaps we had better hasten your training. \nCUT TO: \nBARNYARD - DAY \nOutside the castle wall Hodge is feeding the chickens and ducks. He straightens up and squints through the early morning mists. On a distant hillock two figures are moving toward the woods. \nULRICH AND GALEN \nHobbling slowly with the aid of a pair of canes, Ulrich guides his pupil across a wooden bridge and along a stream into the forest. \nULRICH (stern and troubled) This wood, these leaves, the birds, the very dome of heaven, once they all rang with one great chord: and philosophers like me kept it all in tune. Now, new voices are singing new songs. (sharply) Have you mastered the threefold transmutation? \nGALEN Of course. \nULRICH (skeptical) You have? \nGALEN Well, almost. \nULRICH It's very difficult. Have you committed to memory undying the Codex de Profundis? \nGALEN (a shrug) The first two chapters. \nULRICH It's long. And what about the Ritual of Banishment as prescribed by my late master Balisarius? \nGALEN To tell the truth, I haven't dared try it. What's the point, anyway? \nULRICH The point? The point is you don't know it, and you're no magician without it. It was my hope to school you, to mold your faculties and wits... I still believe you have some talent. Somewhere. \nGALEN I hate books. I hate drill. I want a real task. \nULRICH There's no time now. When I'm gone, half the powers in the universe will vanish with me. And what's the use of a few lingering skills if they're left in the hands of a child? (pause) Listen! \nGALEN I don't hear anything. \nUlrich gauges the young man standing before him and makes a decision. Reaching under his cloak he lifts off a fine silver chain with an amulet dangling from it. He drapes it around Galen's neck. \nULRICH Here, wear this. \nGalen instinctively wraps his hand around the jewel. He cocks an ear. \nGALEN Voices, singing on the road. \nHe hastens forward to a promontory, eager to have a look. Ulrich does not follow. Instead, doffing his cloak, he whirls it before him, where it magically floats a few feet off the ground. Awkwardly, the old man clambers aboard. \nGALEN I don't see anything. \nHe turns back, but the wizard is gone. A shadow falls over him. He looks up. There, two hundred feet above the tree tops his master is soaring on the wind. \nAIRBORNE \nThe old conjurer squints into the distance. Miles away and far below a company of drab walkers winds along the margins of the forest. They are singing a mournful round. \n", "test1_id": 2205, "test2_input": "DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY \nGalen bounds up the rocky slope as fast as he can manage, trailed by a desperate Valerian. \nVALERIAN Galen, stop! Please, I beg you! \nBut Galen pays no attention. In a burst of speed and fury, Valerian comes up behind and tackles him. \nVALERIAN Stop! I won't let you kill yourself. \nGalen waves the leather pouch in Valerian's face. \nGALEN He couldn't walk -- he knew he couldn't make the journey. So he had us make the journey for him! Don't you see? \nHe jumps up and runs to the mouth of the lair. \nVALERIAN (pursuing) No! \nShe tackles him again. \nVALERIAN All right, all right. You're going in there, I'm going too. \nGALEN (brought up short) What? Why? No you're not, this is my job. Absolutely not. \nBut Valerian springs to her feet and starts into the lair. \nVALERIAN I'm not afraid. And you're not going to stop me. After all -- I've been a man longer than you have. \nGalen pauses long enough to snatch up a discarded torch near the remains of the wooden stake, then charges after her. \nUNDERGROUND \nRunning footsteps resound in the steamy passageway and Galen comes around the corner holding his torch high to light the way. Valerian stumbles after him. He grabs her hand. \nGALEN Stay close. \nDown and down they go. Soon they reach Elspeth's body. \nVALERIAN What's that? \nGALEN Never mind. Come on. \nBut she pulls the torch from his hand and goes over to see. \nGALEN All right. Wait here. \nHe darts off. In the flickering torchlight Valerian can see the Princess' remains all too clearly. She suppresses a scream. \nVALERIAN Galen? Galen? Where are you? \nNo answer. The torch reveals several passages. She doesn't know which one to take. \nLAKE OF FIRE \nThe passage widens out and once again Galen is standing on the shores of the lake of fire. He looks around. The water is rolling with bubbles of gas, and flames run hither and yon across the surface, but there is no sign of the dragon. Gathering his courage, he hops across the stepping stones to the middle of the lake. There he hurriedly opens the pouch. \n", "test2_true": "Gripping the amulet with his free hand, he scatters Ulrich's ashes in a wide arc over the burning water. Instantly, there is an ominous rumble and the earth gives a shrug. But no wizard appears. No dragon, either. There follows another and stronger quake. Galen crouches to keep his balance. Still no wizard. \nOUTSIDE \nThoroughly bewildered, Valerian stumbles out into daylight. She wanders a few yards down the slope and collapses against the stake. Something is strange: it's getting dark. Squinting up at the sun, she frowns in puzzlement, then gapes at what is happening. \nECLIPSE \nSlowly and ponderously the black disk of the moon slides over the face of the sun, plunging the world into crepuscular half-light. \nCUT TO: \nGRANGE HALL - DAY \nThe congregation is confused and frightened by the sudden darkness. \nGREIL Be calm. He watcheth over us! And this is His sign! Let us pray! Our Father who art in heaven... \nThe faithful bow their heads and join in. Simon as well. \nCUT TO: \nLAKE OF FIRE \nThe earthquakes have subsided; the water is calm. Galen stares bleakly into the flames. As he watches, they gather themselves into a lazy spiral. Gradually the spiral speeds up and becomes a vortex. Now the flames become tinged with green, and as the cavern moans with the sound of rushing air, a form takes shape at the crest of a jet of flame. It is Ulrich, supine as upon his pyre, reforming before Galen's eyes. \nGALEN Ulrich! Magister! Over here! I can see you! Over here! \nULRICH (looks at him) Not so loud. I'm not deaf, you know. \nHe slowly raises himself into an upright posture and strides through the flames. \nULRICH Sic redit magus ex terra mortis. \nThe apprentice throws himself at his master's feet. \nGALEN Wonder of wonders -- you're back! I thank the powers that made me! \nULRICH Glad to see you, too. You didn't bring along anything to eat, by any chance? \nGALEN Food? \nULRICH No? Oh well, no time anyway. \nOUTSIDE \nValerian is standing in the unearthly twilight, anxiously peering into the mouth of the lair. Suddenly she is hit from behind by a gust of wind. She does not turn to see the enormous Vermithrax alighting silently behind her. \nGALEN & ULRICH \nUlrich raises Galen to his feet. \nULRICH Come along. There's much to be done. \nGALEN Wait, I have something to tell you. \n", "test2_id": 2206, "test3_input": "Valerian wrestles the amulet away from Galen. It falls to the ground. \nVALERIAN You heard what he said. \nShe lifts the chunk of stone. Galen grabs for it. \nGALEN No! You can't! \nTHE LAST ATTACK \nVermithrax spirals up into the storm, then drops earthward. Ulrich watches as the beast comes straight at him. He folds his arms and bows his head. Leathery wings humming, the creature levels out, swoops up past the crag and lifts the master magician away in its huge hind claw. \nULRICH Galen! \nGalen and Valerian are horrified to see the dragon circling upward with the sorcerer writhing in agony in its grip. As the monstrous thing flies high over them, they can hear Ulrich's faint screams. \nDEATH \nNow Galen understands. He seizes the granite block from Valerian and raises it with both hands over his head. He takes a final look at the amulet, glowing at his feet, then brings the rock down with all his might. There is a blinding flash as it shatters into a million fragments. \nFar above there is another blinding flash as Ulrich's earthly body explodes against the belly of the beast. The darkened sky lights up as huge gouts of flame spew forth from the dragon's gut. Wings fluttering uselessly, this reptilian torch plummets to the ground. \nLAKE \nBelow, a stock pond nestled in the foothill pastures. Trailing a wake of flame, Vermithrax plunges like a comet into the water. There is a stupendous splash and eruption of steam. \nGALEN & VALERIAN \nThey stare down from their lofty perch, watching as further explosions boil the water from the pond. \nECLIPSE \nBehind a tattered wrack of cloud, the moon slowly uncovers a pale sun. \nDISSOLVE: \nTHE CARCASS - DAY \nGrey misty light reveals the beast's mangled remains. Galen and Valerian emerge from the fog, walk under a blackened wing and make their way through the mud and loose scales to the huge charred head. The death agony has twisted it upside down. The mouth is frozen in a grotesque look of surprise. The eyes are glazed. Now the sound of voices floats toward them, chanting an ancient hymn. A moment later a mob of Christians, led by Greil, crests a hill and moves toward the hulk. The song ends. \nGREIL Let us pray. \nThe members of the congregation fall to their knees. \nGREIL We thank thee, Lord, for this divine deliverance. Verily is thy presence amongst us, fully manifest in this, thy great work. \nGalen and Valerian look at each other. She takes his hand. \nGREIL Arise, children of the Lord and forsake evermore the pagan mysteries. Rejoice in the true power of the Christian God! \nGalen turns and leads Valerian away. They disappear into the mist. \nDISSOLVE: \nFLENSING - DAY \n", "test3_true": "THE KING \nWith the crack of a whip and the clatter of hooves, the royal coach pulls up to the shore of the lake. A door creaks open and King Casiodorus totters out. His face is puffy, his eyes are red. He slogs through the mud to the head of the dragon and commences hacking at it with a ceremonial sword. Horsrik steps out of the coach and draws himself up. \nHORSRIK (loud) All hail Casiodorus Rex -- Dragon slayer! \nThe workers pause long enough to listen to this pronouncement and cast a glance at the sorry spectacle. Wordlessly they resume their labors. \nHORSRIK (nodding) Hail and praise be! \nDISSOLVE: \nON THE ROAD - DAY \nThe trail leads through copses and open meadows. Side by side, Galen and Valerian march up a long slope under a hot sun. He limps a bit; she finds a staff and hands it to him. \nVALERIAN You want to rest? \nGALEN No. I'm fine. \nVALERIAN You miss Ulricn. \nGALEN Yes. \nVALERIAN And the amulet. \nGALEN That too. \nVALERIAN Not me. I'm glad it's gone. I'm glad you did what you did. (he doesn't reply) You may not be a sorcerer, Galen, but I love you anyway. I don't regret anything that happened. I just wish -- \nGALEN Yes? \nVALERIAN (sighs) -- that we had a horse. \nGalen falls a step behind. He briefly closes his eyes and mutters something. They walk on a few paces. Then there is a whinny from the nearby woods and a white stallion canters forth. It crosses a meadow, comes right up to Valerian and nuzzles her. \nVALERIAN What is this? \nGALEN A horse. \nVALERIAN Did you...!? \nGALEN No. It must have been wandering loose. Or wild. \nGalen climbs aboard. He reaches out to help her up. \nVALERIAN Wait a minute. I just wished for a horse and here it is. \nGALEN You don't want to wish it gone, do you? \nShe thinks for a moment, then lets him help her up. Galen touches the horse's flanks with his heels and they ride off. \nFADE OUT: \nTHE END \n", "test3_id": 2207}

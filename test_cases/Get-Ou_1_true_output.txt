Chris, veers the car into a tree. Georgina`s head hits the windshield hard and bursts open. She's dead. So is the car. 
A bullet hits the rear view mirror. Jeremy stands in front of the smoking house with a hunting rifle. He's soaked in blood. 
JEREMY (THROUGH TEARS) Grandma!!!! 
Chris looks at Georgina's body. Georgina was Grandma. 
JEREMY (CONT'D) Grampa! 
Walter, the grounds keeper, rounds the house at top speed. Walter is grandpa and he's so fast. 
JEREMY (CONT'D) Get him!!! 
Chris crawls out of the car as Walter/Grandpa sprints across the front lawn strait at him. Walter's hat flies off revealing the surgical scar around his head like the others. 
Jeremy shoots again, and it grazes Chris' side. Chris runs through the trees. Walter/grandpa closes the gap quickly. Another shot hits a tree. As Chris reaches the road, Walter/ Grandpa pounces like a jaguar and rolls him over on his back. He pushes his thumbs into Chris' eyes. 
GRANDPA Damn you to Hell!!! 
Jeremy arrives behind them crying. 
JEREMY Kill him, Grandpa. 
GRANDPA The gun, Jeremy. 
Jeremy tosses the rifle. Grandpa catches it and holds it up to chris' head. 
GRANDPA (CONT'D) You ruined everything!!! 
Chris, blinded, raises his phone to Walter/Grandpa's face. He takes a picture, flashing strait into Walter/Grandpa's eyes. 
Walter/Grandpa doesn't shoot. Instead he looks up. Jeremy is confused as to why Walter/Grandpa has stopped. 
JEREMY What...? Grandpa--? 
Walter/Grandpa spins and gathers his bearing. His eye is cocked and blood trickles out of his nose. He let's out a PAINED MOAN reminiscent of the deer's. 
WALTER/GRANDPA Ahhhhhhh! 
Walter/Grandpa shoots Jeremy in the chest. He falls. Chris, on his back, pushes himself away. Walter/Grandpa sees Chris' scurry. He turns looking mad. 
CHRIS Wait. 
Walter/Grandpa raises the gun under his own chin and shoots himself through the head. He falls. Approaching sirens blare in the distance. 
Chris lays in shock. It's over. Just then a hand grabs Chris face! Jeremy's still alive! Blood pours from his mouth. 
JEREMY Ahhhhhh! 
They both go for the gun, grabbing it at the same time. They roll around in the grass. Chris ends up on top. He bludgeons Jeremy over and over with the butt of the gun into the ground. Chris is lost in violence. 
2 police cars pull up. He drops the gun. 
COPS Hands! Hands! Get away from the weapon/ Show me your hands!/ Hands! Hands!! Get on your Knees!/ Hands! Hands!/ Goddamn Hands!!! 
Chris, covered in blood, raises his sliced hands. 
CHRIS Look in the basement! 
He is violently swarmed by officers. The house burns. 
INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON. VISITING ROOM - NIGHT 
Rod sits down opposite Chris who wears a prison jumpsuit and smokes a cigarette. Both of them look like shit. Rod is gaunt with circles under his eyes. Chris' hair and beard have grown in. 
There's a long silence. 
ROD I really need to... 
CHRIS ...I don't remember...

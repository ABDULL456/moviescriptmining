They collapse on the couch. 
LEOPOLD Ah, JFK, PDQ, XYZ. 
KATE I don't know. K.D. Lang. 
LEOPOLD I don't know how you keep up with it. I'm exhausted. 
KATE So am I. 
LEOPOLD I'll tell you what. Why don't I prepare dinner tomorrow night? I never have before. I mean even before I hit town. "Hit town" How's that? I can't imagine what it'll taste like, but I don't think it will be any worse than your cooking. 
KATE Leopold, I have a date tomorrow night. 
LEOPOLD I see. 
KATE A blind date. 
LEOPOLD Oh, I'm so sorry. 
KATE No, that just means I haven't met him before. It was set up through friends. 
LEOPOLD Ah! 
KATE A hazard of single life... I'm turning in. 
Kate gets up. Leopold automatically stands. 
LEOPOLD Another time then. 
KATE I'm sorry. 
LEOPOLD It's quite all right. 
As she gets to the door, she stops. 
KATE Leopold? I had a wonderful time today. I can't remember the last time I took the day off and just played. I'd forgotten how beautiful this city can be... I want to thank you for that. 
LEOPOLD The pleasure was mine. 
Kate smiles at Leopold and goes out. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Charlie, in a tie, is standing with Leopold at the dining room table. Kate wearing too much makeup for her date, runs into the bathroom in a BRIGHT RED DRESS. 
CHARLIE It's a very fancy restaurant, Leopold. Are you sure you can teach me everything there is to know? 
KATE (from the bathroom) Just don't swipe the silverware and give yourself away. 
CHARLIE Nobody's talking to you. 
LEOPOLD It is very simple. I will be your date. Just behave as you normally would and I'll correct you along the way. Now, escort me in. 
Charlie and Leopold move across the room. After a beat, Charlie magnanimously gestures for Leopold to go first. Leopold gives his approval. Kate rushes out of the bathroom in a tight BLACK dress. 
Leopold and Charlie elegantly walk to the table. Charlie sits down, pleased. Leopold remains standing, incensed. 
CHARLIE Now what? 
Leopold takes a cloth napkin, hits Charlie upside the head. Hard. 
LEOPOLD Pull the chair for a lady! Clod. 
KATE (V.O.) No name calling. 
LEOPOLD (to Kate) Well, really! 
Charlie stands up and pulls out the chair. As Leopold sits, Charlie pushes the chair in to hard. 
LEOPOLD You're not shoveling coal into a furnace, Charles. Glide the chair in gently. Gently. Try it again. 
Charlie gently glides Leopold to the table. He remains standing, not sure what to do next. 
LEOPOLD Well, sit down! 
CHARLIE Now don't burst a vein or anything, but there are quite a few knives and forks here. How do I know what each one's for? 
LEOPOLD Merely start from the outside and work your way in. 
CHARLIE What kind of beer should I order? 
LEOPOLD Beer!

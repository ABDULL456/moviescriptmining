{"test1_input": "EXT.  TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.  MORNING. \nTRUMAN sits in his car, about to lace his coffee.  From inside the adjacent Elementary School gymnasium, he hears the familiar excited squeals and shouts of SCHOOL CHILDREN.  Truman suddenly throws aside his miniature of Jack Daniels and sprints across the parking lot and into the school. \nINT.  UTOPIA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.  MORNING. \nTRUMAN slams through the front doors into the reception area. It is deserted, no one stationed at the administration desk, the corridors empty.  He runs down a vacant corridor, pushing open classroom doors as he goes.  They are all unoccupied. \nFinally, he stands outside the gymnasium.  The childrens' voices can still be heard.  Truman takes a deep breath and bursts through the double doors. \nThe room is empty save for a large reel-to-reel tape recorder in the middle of the basketball court playing a continuous tape of childrens' voices.  The recorder is attached to speakers on tall stands facing the ventilation ducts.  Truman stares at the machine in disbelief. \nEXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING. \nTRUMAN exits the subway, still lost in thought.  He stops at the newstand and picks up a copy of Vanity Fair to resume his ritual search but his heart is not in it. \nHe starts his trek to work, pausing to stare at his reflection in the mirrored building, hoping that the Homeless Man will appear at his side once again.  But no one joins him. \nHowever, as Truman continues to stare, it is the building itself that takes his interest.  An imposing forty-story office building, a black, sheer mirrored box clad in the kind of reflective glass that shields its occupants from the world, a building Truman passes every day. \nAs usual, a steady stream of EMPLOYEES and VISITORS enter and exit the building's high-ceilinged lobby past an intimidating security desk manned by two UNIFORMED GUARDS.  Beyond security are banks of elevators, ferrying executives, clerical staff and delivery personnel to and from their floors of business. \nTruman abruptly enters the building.  He strides confidently past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs. \nSECURITY GUARD 1 (to Truman) Can I help? \nTRUMAN (sneaking a glance at the building directory) I have an appointment at, er...Diamond Enterprises. \nSECURITY GUARD 1 They went bust. \nThe second Security Guard is rising from his seat to block Truman's path to the elevators but Truman reads his mind and makes a dash for it. \nHe slips into an elevator just as the doors are closing, defeating the flailing arm of the pursuing guard.  A WOMAN EXECUTIVE in the elevator looks in horror at Truman.  The cause of her concern becomes all too apparent.  Looking beyond the woman, Truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator car. \nThe elevator is simply an opening into the body of the building. Truman pushes past the Woman to be confronted with the fact that the entire office block is nothing but a giant, empty shell with no floors above the ground floor. \nThe PEOPLE Truman has just witnessed entering the other elevators are milling around a refreshment table, sitting on folding chairs, changing their clothes behind temporary curtained cubicles or lining up to re-enter the bogus elevator cars.  Gradually, they all turn to gape at Truman, who in turn stares back, appalled. \nThe Security Guards suddenly appear at Truman's side and take him by the arm. \nSECURITY GUARD 1 You gotta leave. \nTRUMAN (riveted by the equally-stunned building occupants) What're they doing? \nSECURITY GUARD 2 You gotta leave. \nThe Guards frog-march Truman out of the huge facade towards an Emergency Exit. \nTRUMAN (not going quietly) Just tell me what the hell's going on? \nSECURITY GUARD 1 We're re-modelling. \nTRUMAN Like fuck!  What're they doing? \nEXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY. \nTRUMAN continues to struggle as the GUARDS usher him to the street. \nTRUMAN You don't tell me, I'll get you investigated! \nSECURITY GUARD 2 Investigate what?  You're trespassing! \nTruman sees there is no point in arguing further.  His shouts are attracting the interest of PASSERS-BY.  A thought occurs to him. \nHe starts to run along the street, suddenly entering another building at random.  An office block with a bank on the ground floor.  As he skirts the bank, he feels the eyes of the BANK STAFF and CUSTOMERS on him.  Is he so suspicious-looking or were they expecting him? \nTruman rushes to the elevators.  The lights above the doors show all the elevators on upper floors.  Frantic pressing of the elevator button gets no response.  Truman heads for the stairs but is intercepted by a BANK OFFICIAL who bars his way. \nOFFICIAL You can't-- \nTRUMAN (anticipating his response) --I know. \nTruman backs away out of the office and continues to run down the streets of Lower Manhattan's financial district.  Every building he encounters seems to have a SECURITY GUARD anticipating his arrival or a building OFFICIAL hanging a CLOSED FOR BUSINESS sign on the front door. \nHe feels the eyes of PEDESTRIANS.  Is he simply drawing attention to himself by his behavior?  Truman wheels around, trying to make eye contact with passers-by.  They shy away. Truman stops still, his head reeling. \n", "test1_true": "From the office window on the twelfth floor, TRUMAN can observe the glass building down the street.  He ponders the black, mirrored box.  LAWRENCE appears at his side. \nTRUMAN You ever been into the AMT Building? \nLAWRENCE (following Truman's gaze) Not since they begun reconstruction. (referring to the file in Truman's hands) What're you doing with that? \nTRUMAN (defensive) I'm going to visit a site. \nLAWRENCE What for? \nTRUMAN Because I never do. \nLAWRENCE (placing a hand on Truman's arm) That's why we got adjusters. \nTRUMAN (looking at Lawrence's hand on his arm) You got a problem with me going? \nLAWRENCE I got a problem with you not doing your job, Burbank.  You already screwed up once this week. \nTRUMAN Let me worry about that. \nTruman exits with the report.  After waiting only a matter of seconds for an elevator, he impatiently enters the stairwell. \nAs soon as he disappears from sight, a grim CHRISTOF emerges from a nearby office, shadowed as always by CHLOE.   They approach Lawrence with the familiarity of business associates. \nLAWRENCE 680 West 89th. \nChristof nods.  Chloe opens a flip-phone to make a call. \nINT.  INSURANCE CO. - STAIRWELL.  DAY. \nAn out-of-breath TRUMAN arrives on the second floor landing of the stairwell to find two burly MOVERS blocking his path with a large office desk they are attempting to transport. Truman considers retracing his steps, then without warning clambers over the mahogany barrier. \nMOVER 1 Hey, would it kill ya to wait?! \nINT.  SUBWAY.  DAY. \nTRUMAN paces impatiently on an empty subway platform with other frustrated passengers.  He loses patience and suddenly turns and runs up the stairs. \nINT.  TAXI CAB.  DAY. \nTRUMAN sits seething in a traffic jam that exists for no apparent reason. \nTRUMAN (impatiently to driver) Is there another way?  Can't you get around this? \nEXT.  A CHARRED APARTMENT BUILDING ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.  DAY. \nTRUMAN exits his taxi and takes in the scene.  A partially burnt building, waterlogged, still faintly smoldering.  Truman checks the address on his file.  A small, serious-looking BOY straddles his bicycle on the sidewalk. \nTRUMAN (to the boy) When was the fire? \nBOY (shrug) Week ago. \nTRUMAN How come it's still smoking? \nBOY Started up again. (dismissive) Kids. \nTRUMAN (referring to his claims report) Says here it burnt to the ground. \nBOY Wishful thinking maybe? \nThe boy is wise well beyond his years.  Truman fixes him with a glare. \nTRUMAN Someone send you to tell me all this? \nBOY (unfazed) You the one askin' questions. \nThe boy casually rides away. \nEXT.  CITY PARK.  DAY. \nTRUMAN wanders aimlessly through a city park, observing.  We sense, truly observing for the first time. \nA group of YOUTHS play a pick-up game of basketball.  A YOUNG WOMAN walks a pair of AFGHAN HOUNDS.  An OLD MAN answers the incessant questions of his GRANDCHILD.  Nothing appears amiss. \n", "test1_id": 2346, "test2_input": "TRUMAN (screaming above the baby's cries) Say my name!  You know my name!  Say it! \nYOUNG MOTHER (bewildered) I don't know you. \nThe commotion has attracted the attention of an OLD MAN across the street, watering his garden.  He drops his hose and hurries towards the fracas.  Halfway across the street, the old man stops in his tracks as he sees the baby, perilously poised in the air. \nTRUMAN (hysterical) I mean it!  I'm ready to do it! What's my name?!! \nTruman lifts the screaming baby as far above his head as he can, his arms shaking, fighting the urge to dash the fragile innocent to the concrete.  We see a view of the scene from the POV of a streetlight.  The young mother, recognizing Truman's seriousness, opens her mouth to speak but no sound comes. \nTRUMAN (entreating the young woman, tears in his eyes) This is your last chance! \nThe anguish in his voice convinces us that Truman is truly on the brink.  The young woman now has tears rolling down her cheeks.  She is at a loss, powerless. \nTRUMAN (his entire body shaking) What...is...my...name?! \nThe young woman mumbles but is unable to supply the name. Truman, arms shaking, face red with rage, realizes he can't go through with it.  With everything he has, he gathers himself. After what seems like an age, he ever so slowly lowers the child into the safety of the mother's outstretched arms. \nYOUNG MOTHER (clutching the baby to her breast, without thinking) Thank you, Truman. \nTruman shudders at the sound of his name and backs away from the young woman, as if it is she who now represents the threat. \nHe jumps into his car and slams it into gear, driving over the sidewalk and back onto the street.  The young woman and the old man stare after Truman's car as it roars away. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DAY. \nAs TRUMAN drives, he stares, paranoid, at seemingly innocuous features in his Oldsmobile - his rearview mirror, steering wheel insignia, speedometer, airconditioning ducts - and peers up at the streetlamps lining the roadway. \nINT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY. \nA dozen-or-so of SYLVIA'S FRIENDS, including the MAN we have seen before, sit around a table on the balcony in the afternoon sun, talking animatedly.  A TEN-YEAR-OLD SON of one of the guests has strayed into the living room and switched on the television set hidden away in an antique bureau. \nSYLVIA. emerging from the kitchen, is taken aback by what she sees playing on the screen.  The MAN on the balcony catches her look as she swiftly switches off the TV.  She gently takes the child's hand and leads him outside. \nEXT.  TRUMAN'S BACKYARD.  DAY. \nTRUMAN, staring at the freeway from the bottom of the garden. doesn't bother to look up as MERYL approaches. \nTRUMAN (referring to a distant car on the expressway) See that car way down there?  I bet it's a Suburu station wagon. \nMeryl looks idly over the fence at the approaching car. Finally a Suburu station wagon motors by.  Meryl is unimpressed. Truman turns his back on the Expressway to continue his game. \nTRUMAN I predict the next four cars will be a white Honda Civic, a blue and white Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing, a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender and a motorcycle. \nMeryl doesn't wish to participate in the game and makes for the house.  Truman holds her arm, forcing her to watch.  He turns to check his prediction.  A convoy of cars approaches. \nTRUMAN There's the Honda...the Dodge...here comes the dented Beetle... \nMeryl's attention wavers.  Truman tightens his grip. \nTRUMAN Look, damn you! \nFollowing the VW is a school bus. \nMERYL (mocking) Where's the motorcycle? \nTruman is momentarily disappointed.  Meryl seizes her chance and heads for the house.  Truman follows her inside. \nTRUMAN (yelling after her) Don't you want to know how I did that? Maybe you already know.  Is that it? \nBehind Truman's back, a motorcycle putters by. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  DAY. \nMERYL is pouring herself ice tea when TRUMAN enters. \nMERYL Where have you been?  I've been calling you all day. \nTRUMAN Have you been concerned, Meryl?  Nice name. \"Meryl\".  I always liked it. \nMERYL (matching his sarcasm) Nice of you to say so after eight years. \nTRUMAN Actress's name, isn't it?  What's your real name? \nMERYL (rolling her eyes) Oh, God.  What's got into you? \n", "test2_true": "MERYL I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday. I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me... \nTRUMAN (irritated) Drop it, I said.  It's over. \nMERYL (rambling on) ...we need more charcoal. \nTRUMAN Shut up! \nMERYL I'm gonna take a shower. \nTRUMAN (catching her wrist) No.  We're going for a drive. \nMERYL What?! \nDespite her protests, Truman drags Meryl out the back door and towards his car. \nTRUMAN (as he shoves her into the Oldsmobile) For years I've been saying I want to go some place, well now I'm ready to go.  Let's just jump in the car and go. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DAY. \nTRUMAN holds MERYL's wrist to stop her exiting the car and accelerates out of the driveway in reverse without looking. \nTRUMAN (as they speed down the suburban street) I thought maybe, Atlantic City. \nMERYL (trying to mask her anxiety) You hate gambling. \nTRUMAN That's right.  I do, don't I? \nMERYL So why do you wanna go? \nTRUMAN Cos I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?  Cos you're curious.  I haven't been curious since I was seven years old, y'know that?  Back then you'd have to nail me to the floor to keep me in one place. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. \nAll eyes watch the large monitor as surveillance cameras track Truman's speeding car. \nCHRISTOF How long to take Atlantic City out of mothballs? \nSIMEON We could be up and running...three hours maybe. \nCHRISTOF Give me a number five gridlock on the Jersey Turnpike. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK. \nTRUMAN and MERYL are hemmed in by a traffic snarl on the New Jersey Turnpike.  We observe the Oldsmobile on a television lens from the POV of a tail-light on the car ahead. \nTRUMAN (a manic edge to his voice) So much traffic, this time of day.  Does that strike you as peculiar? \nOn the side of the road, TWO MOTORISTS, are arguing over a minor collision. \nTRUMAN (sneering at the sight of the motorists) Look at them.  You believe they're fighting?  I don't believe it. (shouting out the window to the motorists) Why don't you slug him, really make it authentic? \nWithout warning, Truman suddenly exits the freeway.  But his move is anticipated.  At the end of the offramp a pack of cars suddenly appears.  Other vehicles fill the gap behind. \nTRUMAN (to Meryl, marveling) Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree? \nMERYL (incredulous) You blaming me for the traffic? \nTRUMAN Should I? \nMERYL You've never been on this road before. You don't know what it's like. \nTRUMAN (manic) That's true.  We could be stuck here for hours.  Could be like this all the way to Atlantic City. \nTruman suddenly veers the Oldsmobile onto the sidewalk. \nMERYL What the hell are you doing? \nTRUMAN You're right.  Let's go back.  I'm sorry.  I don't know what got into me. \nTruman rejoins the New Jersey Turnpike, heading back towards Queens, the roadway now relatively free of traffic. \nMERYL Would you please slow down, Truman? \n", "test2_id": 2347, "test3_input": "CHRISTOF (O.C.) ...and, action background... \nAt the command, the PEDESTRIANS and VEHICLES begin inoving normally, TRUMAN exits the subway, suspecting nothing.  He begins his trek to work, accompanied by the cued rush hour traffic. \nCHRISTOF (O.C.) ...nice...nice...I like the woman with the dog... let's keep it moving...I want that traffic kept together...everybody look like you've got places to go... \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. \nCHRISTOF covers his microphone to deliver an aside to SIMEON, from whom he has temporarily assumed the role of director. \nCHRISTOF I bet he doesn't stop at the newstand. \nAs predicted, Truman walks by, barely glancing at a newspaper's banner headline, \"NUCLEAR POWER PLANT REOPENED\".  Christof scans the shot options available to him on the video wall. \nCHRISTOF ...Bodycam Two... \nThe large On-Air Monitor cuts to Truman, via the point-of-view of an approaching PEDESTRIAN.  For an instant, the unaware Truman looks directly into the lens of the disguised camera. \nCHRISTOF ...streetlight eight... \nThe monitor cuts to an overhead shot from a streetlamp.  The camera continues to follow Truman's progress. \nCHRISTOF ...ready, Car-Cam One.  Go to One... \nTRUMAN enters his office building as a taxi cruises by. \nCHRISTOF ...and cut to interior... \nTruman is immediately picked up by a hidden camera inside the building where he exchanges a half-hearted greeting with an ancient SECURITY GUARD. \nCHRISTOF ...looser... \nThe camera widens the angle. \nCHRISTOF ...and action, Vivien... (aside, proud of his casting) Looks just like Truman's mother at that age. \nVIVIEN, an insurance adjuster approaches the elevator button at the same time as Truman.  However she reaches for it after Truman has already turned his back. \nCHRISTOF (incensed) Damn, she missed her mark! (impatiently to Simeon) Why do we bother with walk-throughs if nobody pays attention?  Give me a two-shot of Truman and Vivien...go to the master ...hold the elevators... (mustering patience, into microphone) Vivien, press the elevator button again ...and make sure you catch his eye this time... \nINT.  INSURANCE OFFICE LOBBY.  DAY. \nA second time, TRUMAN's brief encounter with VIVIEN goes like clockwork.  As instructed, she hammers away at the elevator button and throws a conspiratorial look to Truman.  The elevator car duly arrives and Truman's eyes follow Vivien's rear as she sachets into the lift.  For a moment he appears to glance at a piece of gaffer tape on the marble floor. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. \nCHRISTOF Good!  Perfect!  Cut to the interior... \nThe monitor cuts to the inside of the elevator, rapidly filling with co-workers. \nCHRISTOF ...and Lawrence... \nJust as the doors are about to close, LAWRENCE oozes in.  He gives Truman a smug smile. \nCHRISTOF ...nice look, Lawrence...and, Vivien... \nThe elevator doors open and Vivien exits with two co-workers. \nLAWRENCE (admiring aside to the remaining fellow-males in the elevator) I wouldn't kick her out of bed. \nTruman doesn't seem to share Lawrence's enthusiasm for the comely young woman.  He is miles away. \nINT.  STUDIO - CONFERENCE ROOM.  DAY. \nAssembled around a long oval table for a story confernce are several principal characters in Truman's life - MERYL, MARLON, ERROL, TYRONE, RAQUEL, VERONICA and the new actress, VIVIEN, sitting slightly apart from the rest of the cast. \nCHRISTOF takes his place at the head of the table, a large monitor showing TRUMAN drinking coffee in his cubicle at American Life plays silently behind Christof's head. \nCHRISTOF (to the meeting, referring to Meryl by her real name) Regrettably, I have to inform you that Hannah has chosen not to renew her contract. \nAll eyes turn to Meryl.  She looks at the floor. \nCHRISTOF I'm sure we can all respect her reasons. \nMeryl receives a sympathetic squeeze of the hand from her co- star Marlon, now out of wardrobe, wearing an Armani suit. \n", "test3_true": "The rest of the cast nod politely in Vivien's direction. \nCHRISTOF (referring to the bound documents CHLOE passes to each cast member) This is a copy of Claudia's back story. Her character's name will be Vivien. She's the new adjuster at the office. \nThe cast idly flip through the documents, prominently stamped on the cover, \"NOT TO BE TAKEN ON SET\". \nCHRISTOF We intend to entice Truman into the affair as soon as possible.  Claudia will make her advance at the seminar Truman's attending next week.  Details are in your schedules.  I'm sure you'll all make Claudia welcome. \nMARLON (injecting a note of levity, more sophisticated than the character he plays) Question is, will Truman make her welcome? \nThe cast snickers. \nCHRISTOF (immediately back to business) I don't have to tell you, how critical the next few weeks will be.  This takes us into the next generation.  When Truman's child is born, the network will be switching to a two-channel format to chronicle both lives. \nVIVIEN What happens when Truman and the baby are both on camera together? \nCHRISTOF There will simply be duplicate coverage. \nVIVIEN (mischievous) Let's just hope we don't have twins. \nCHLOE (uncharacteristically flippant) When Truman dies do we go back to the single channel? \nThe cast turn in her direction.  Christof has a second occasion to question his Assistant's loyalty. \nINT.  A BAR SOMEWHERE.  DAY. \nThe BARMAN, WAITRESS and PATRON we have seen before, observe TRUMAN on the television above the bar.  The cameras track Truman's progress, walking along Broadway.  As he ducks into a sex shop, the threesome at the bar exchange looks.  Inside the store, Truman appears apprehensive. \nBARMAN What's he doing in there? \nPATRON Meryl's at her mom's.  Maybe he's got an urge. \nOn screen, Truman looks through some X-Rated video titles. \nWAITRESS (referring to Truman's overcoat) What's with the coat? \nBARMAN (smirking at the irony) Maybe he doesn't wanna be recognized. \nTruman bumps into a display of sex paraphenalia, knocking an item to the floor. \nPATRON (remarking on Truman's clumsiness) Nervous. \nTruman tries to right the display and hurriedly exits the store, the cameras following his journey as always. \nBARMAN (exasperated) Oh God, he never bought nothing. \nWOMAN Give him a break.  It's taken him thirty- four years to get the nerve to go in there. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT \nWe focus on a list left by Meryl on the refrigerator, several pages long.  The kitchen itself is a bombsite.  More than the cliche dishes in the sink - dozens of cardboard boxes stacked haphazardly on the floor. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT. \nThe usually orderly bedroom is also a mess.  Blankets piled in a heap.  Several large, half-filled cardboard boxes cluttering the room.  A chair in an odd position near the bed.  Clothes strewn everywhere.  Hardly an inch of floor space remains uncovered. \nTRUMAN is asleep in bed, the damaged waterbed replaced with a standard mattress.  Although he is completely covered from head to toe in bedding, the outline of his body is still clearly visible. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT. \nClose up on the On-Air monitor in the temple of a control room.  It displays a wide shot of Truman's darkened bedroom filmed through the green hue of the night vision cameras. Assistant Producer, SIMEON, and his VIDEO OPERATORS slouch in their swivel chairs paying scant attention to the screen. Simeon gives his instructions in a lethargic, metronomic manner. \nSIMEON ...Ready two.  Go to two. \nOperator, eating a doughnut, presses one of the illuminated buttons on the panel and the camera angle changes to a close shot of Truman's covered head.  The camera stays on the blanketed head for a long moment. \nSIMEON And back to the medium. \nAnother button is pressed and the angle changes.  A trace of frustration is evident in the control room.  Recording a sleeping subject is unrewarding enough without also having to contend with Truman's recently aquired camera-shyness. \nSIMEON ...and wide... \nOPERATOR (aside to Simeon) Could we have picked a bigger loser if we tried? \n", "test3_id": 2348}

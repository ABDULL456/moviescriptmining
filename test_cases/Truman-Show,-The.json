{"train": "\"The Truman Show\", early, by Andrew M. Niccol \nTHE TRUMAN SHOW \nA Screen Play \nBy \nAndrew M. Niccol \nFADE IN \nA white title appears on a black screen. \n\"One doesn't discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time.\" \nAndre Gide \nThe title fades off, replaced by a second title. \n\"We're all in this alone.\" \nLily Tomlin \nINT.  A WOMB.  DAY. \nA fiber optic camera observes a five-month-old MALE FETUS as he gently floats, weightless, suspended in the amniotic fluid of his mother's womb.  We focus on the unborn's hand, already a tiny, exquisite work of art, moving towards his newly formed lips.  He sucks his thumb. \nINT.  HOSPITAL - DELIVERY ROOM.  DAY. \nA seconds old BABY BOY - umbilical cord still attached, smeared with blood and protective skin grease - is held up by an anonymous pair of latex gloves to the camera.  Shocked by the unaccustomed light and cool of the delivery room, the newborn fights for his first, arduous breath.  Following almost immediately, a cry. \nFrom another angle we see the crying infant on a television screen, the individual lines of the screen clearly visible. \nMATCH DISSOLVE TO \nINT.  CAR - UTOPIA, QUEENS.  MORNING. \nThe face of the baby thirty-four years later, still crying. TRUMAN BURBANK, thinning hair, a body going soft around the edges, appearing older than his thirty-four years sits at the wheel of his eight-year-old Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.  He cries without shame, making no attempt to wipe away the tears. \nPausing at an intersection in a quiet, working-class suburban street, a spherical glass object suddenly falls from the sky and lands with a deafening crash on the roadway, several yards in front of his idling car. \nTruman exits the Oldsmobile to investigate.  Amidst a sea of shattered glass are the remains of a light mechanism. \nHe looks around him but the street is deserted.  He checks that all the surrounding streetlights are accounted for, even though the fallen fixture is far larger.  He looks up into the sky but there is no plane in sight.  With some effort, Truman picks up what's left of the crumpled light, loads it into the trunk of his car and drives away. \nINT.  CAR - TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.  MORNING. \nTRUMAN sits behind the wheel of his car, unscrews the cap of a miniature bottle of Jack Daniels and empties the contents into his Styrofoam cup of coffee.  Stirring it in with his finger, he burns himself. \nTRUMAN Shit! \nAs Truman drinks, he becomes aware of the delighted squeals of children coming from the gymnasium of Utopia Elementary School, adjacent to the parking lot.  The sound of the children triggers a memory in his head. \nEXT.  LONG, WIDE BEACH.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER. \nUnlike a conventional flashback, the scene in his memory appears to be playing on a television screen. \nA sandy-haired, SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, runs towards a bluff on the beach. \nThe boy's father, KIRK, late-thirties, beer bottle in hand, flirts with two TEENAGE GIRLS at the shoreline.  Suddenly, the father remembers his son.  He looks anxiously around.  The sight of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him to drop his bottle in the sand and run to him. \nThe boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated father comes within earshot. \nFATHER (out of breath, clutching his side) Truman!  Truman!  Stop! \nTruman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his father.  But the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the anger and distress on his father's face. \nFATHER Come down now! \nHis father's unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more tantalizing.  The boy considers defying his father.  He puts his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek at the other side.  One good stretch would do it. \nFATHER (reading Truman's mind, enraged) No! \nTRUMAN (sensing his father is keeping something from him) Why?  What's there? \nTruman replaces the receiver, disappointed. \nINT.  LOCAL ITALIAN DELI.  LUNCHTIME. \nTRUMAN stands in line with a crush of other WHITE COLLAR WORKERS.  As he reaches the counter, the store owner, TYRONE, has anticipated his order and ahs already begun preparing a meatball and mozzarella sandwich on Italian roll.  Truman gazes at the sandwich skillfully under construction, pained by his own predictability. \nTYRONE (nauseatngly cheerful) How's it goin', Truman? \nTRUMAN (deadpan) Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery. \nTYRONE (not listening to Truman's reply, as Truman anticipated) Good.  Good. \nTRUMAN Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today? \nTYRONE (not missing a beat) I'd ask for identification. \nTruman forces a half-smile. \nWe focus on another MALE OFFICE WORKER in line at the cash register, watching Truman out of the corner of his eye.  About to depart with his sandwich, the man receives a guarded rebuke from the FEMALE CASHIER. \nFEMALE CASHIER (a whisper to prevent Truman overhearing) He's right there.  You're supposed to pay when he's here. \nMALE CUSTOMER (nonchalant shrug as he departs) He never notices. \nWe re-focus our attention on Truman who is taking the wrapped sandwich from Tyrone. \nTYRONE Hold on, Truman.  I got somethin' to show ya. \nTyrone holds up a front page of the New York Post that features a photograph of a scaled-down replica of Columbus' Santa Maria, moored in front of the Manhattan skyline.  Truman's eyes widen at the photograph. \nTYRONE (referring to the photo) The flagship of Christoforo...our Genoese navigator, huh?  I know you love this like me. \nTRUMAN (averting his eyes with difficulty) Not me.  You got the wrong man. \nTyrone tries not to let his disappointment show as Truman pays the Cashier and exits. \nTYRONE See ya tomorrow, Truman. \nEXT.  CITY PARK.  DAY. \nTRUMAN eats lunch alone on a concrete bench in a cement park. From his briefcase he pulls out an old hardcovered book, \"To The Ends Of The Earth - The Age Of Exploration\". \nA TRANSIENT in a wheelchair approaches, looking for a handout. Truman gives the homeless man half of his sandwich, reconsiders and gives him it all, his appetite gone.  As the transient wheels himself away, Truman loses himself in his book. \nINT.  A DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY. \nClose up on an old man's face.  CHRISTOF.  Hair pure white, late-sixties, a vitality in his eyes that belies his years. \nHe stands beside a floor-to-ceiling window in a dimly-lit room. Outside the window, a single palm tree swaying against a deep blue Californian sky.  A news anchor-style earpiece disappears down the neck of the unconventionally-cut suit he wears. \nSuspended from the ceiling above his head is a television monitor upon which a surveillance picture of Truman, engrossed in his book, silently plays. \nCHLOE, twenty-something, androgenous-looking, similarly-suited, joins Christof at the window. \nCHRISTOF (never taking his eyes from the monitor) You ever pass a car wreck on the side of the road?  They're pulling out a body.  You know you shouldn't look, but you do. \nINT.  A CONFERENCE ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY. \nA group of a dozen MEN and WOMEN of varying ages sit around a circular conference table in a sterile, windowless meeting room.  All stare at a single telephone placed in the center of the table, anticipating a call.  On cue, the phone rings and one of the men, after waiting for the second ring, picks up. \nMAN Hello?...I'm sorry, I got more than enough insurance. \nHe hangs up.  After a moment the phone rings again. \nINT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY. \nTRUMAN sits at his desk, making a cold call. \nTRUMAN (into receiver) ...this isn't about insurance, this is about the great variable - when will death occur?  Could be a week, a month, a year.  Could happen today...A sunbather, minding his own business, gets stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrella...No way you can guard against that kinda thing, no way at all... \nThe prospect on the other end, unimpressed with his pitch, hangs up.  Truman's supervisor, LAWRENCE, younger than Truman by several years, sharper suit, sharper haircut, appears around the corner of the cubicle. \nLAWRENCE (handing Truman some documentation) Hey, Burbank, I got a bridge-buyer in Stapleton I need you to cloes by four. \nTruman turns pale. \nYOUTH 1 (more insistent) You wannna read to me? \nThe woman looks up, unaware of the boys' presence until now. She quickly avoids eye contact and returns to the book.  The other boy reaches over and snatches the novel from her grasp. \nYOUTH 2 (menacing) My friend asked you a question. \nThe woman picks up her bag from the floor in a reflex and holds it to her.  She looks around the train for assistance, briefly catching Truman's eye.  The youths also look in Truman's direction, staring him down, daring him to interfere. Truman quickly averts his gaze. \nWOMAN (reaching for the book) Please... \nThe boy returns the book to the woman, but before doing so rips out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his shirt pocket. \nYOUTH 2 Now you're gonna have to ask me how it ends. \nThe train pulls into a deserted station.  Feeling vulnerable, the woman jumps up from her seat and exits.  The youths, sensing a chase, also exit.  Scanning the empty platform, the woman realizes she has made a serious error.  Truman watches through the train's open door as the boys corner the frightened woman but still he remains in his seat. \nYOUTH 1 We're gonna tell you how it ends, baby. \nOne of the youths produces a knife from his pocket and waves it in the woman's face. \nYOUTH 2 Don't you wanna know how it ends? \nThe boys pin the woman to the station wall with the weight of their bodies.  The woman looks again in Truman's direction. Again she makes eye contact, eyes pleading. \nWOMAN (screams) Help!!  Please, help!! \nThe woman's second scream is muffled as the train door closes. Truman looks up to the emergency handle beside the door.  There is still time to act.  He stands up and half-reaches for the handle but moves no further. \nThe train abruptly pulls away, leaving Truman time to see one of the youths covering the woman's mouth while the other reaches under her skirt before the train enters the tunnel.  Truman bows his head in shame as the train rattles on. \nINT.  SUBWAY STATION.  DAY. \nThe train safely out of sight, the YOUTHS promptly release the WOMAN.  She calmly hitches down her skirt, no longer afraid. The young men, no longer angry, help fix her hair and retrieve her shoulder bag. \nWOMAN Thanks. \nThe threesome walk along the platform together, as if lifelong friends. \nWOMAN (pondering the incident) He did nothing. \nYOUTH 1 (shrugs, suddenly more couth) Physical violence paralyzes him.  Always has. \nEXT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  DUSK. \nThe backyard of a modest but tidy one-story tract home.  Beyond the plank fence at the end of the property flows a busy Expressway. \nTRUMAN wheels a lawnmower towards the garage as his wife, MERYL, pulls up the drive in her four-year-old Toyota Camry.  She has a sensible blue vinyl bag over her shoulder and carries a new knife-set in a wooden block.  She kisses Truman affectionately on the cheek. \nMERYL (proudly referring to the knife-set) I got it free with the tune-up. \nLooking over Truman's shoulder, she notices a small uncut patch of grass, missed by Truman in one of his passes. \nMERYL You missed a section. \nMeryl enters the house.  Truman restarts the lawnmower and obediantly pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn.  As the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of grass, Truman pulls back abruptly.  He checks the kitchen window for Meryl and wheels the mower away, leaving the patch uncut. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  DAY. \nMERYL is applying ointment to her wrists as TRUMAN enters. \nTRUMAN (referring to her hands) Do they hurt? \nMERYL I was afraid I'd seize up during cross. One of the keys kept sticking. \nTruman picks up Meryl's newspaper and skims idly through it.  He notes an article headlined, \"SLAYING TRIAL ENTERS SIXTH WEEK\". \nTRUMAN (referring to the article) Is he gonna take the stand? \nMERYL (dispassionate, matter-of-fact) No point.  Two eye witnesses saw him near the dumpster where they found the legs. \nShe flexes her arthritic wrists. \nMERYL You gonna eat before you leave? \nTRUMAN I'll get something out. \nTRUMAN (slightly the worse for drink) Tick-fucking-tock.  That's the fucking problem, Marlon.  I'm thirty-four.  I'm older than Jesus Christ. \nMarlon looks sideways at Truman.  It sounds to him like the beer talking. \nTRUMAN Where do the dreams go, Marlon? \nMARLON (picking up the last ball marked with an initial \"T\", trying to ignore the question) You win. \nTRUMAN I'm serious.  Where do the dreams go? \nMARLON (humoring his maudlin friend) They're still there.  Just buried under what we settled for. \nThey approach Truman's Oldsmobile.  Truman opens the trunk to deposit their humble golfing equipment.  Inside are the remains of the fallen light fixture. \nTRUMAN (referring to the light) You really think it could've dropped off an airliner? \nMARLON (unimpressed) Sure.  It's halogen.  You oughta report it. (quickly changing the subject) You coming for a drink? \nTRUMAN I can't tonight. \nEXT.  EATON'S NECK POINT.  DUSK, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER. \nThe lines of a television screen signal another of Truman's flashbacks.  A small group of MOURNERS in black, several openly weeping, stand on the end of a small jetty, including the SEVEN- YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, dry-eyed in an ill-fitting suit, his weeping MOTHER, older sister, RAQUEL, and a PRIEST at the head of the gathering. \nThe priest nods to Truman who holds an ornate wreath, heavy and cumbersome in his tiny hands.  He heaves it off the dock. \nMATCH DISSOLVE TO \nEXT.  EATON'S NECK POINT, LONG ISLAND.  NIGHT, PRESENT. \nA smaller, more simple wreath lands on the calm, dark water beyond the jetty twenty-seven years later.  TRUMAN stares at the wreath for a long moment, turns and wanders back towards the shoreline. \nIn his work suit minus his shoes and socks, he sits on the sand. He has a portable tape recorder slung over his shoulder and points a corded microphone at the surf.  For a long while we watch Truman's impassive face as he makes the recording of the lapping waves, staring up at the handful of stars visible through the gloom. \nWe focus on the lantern room of a nearby lighthouse.  From the light's POV, through the green hue of a night vision camera, we observe Truman get to his feet and walk towards the dark water. \nTRUMAN (shouting at the surf) I'm sorry!  I'm sorry! \nINT.  DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT. \nCHRISTOF's dispassionate face is reflected in the screen of a television monitor that displays the distraught TRUMAN at the water's edge. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nAt the Formica kitchen table, TRUMAN makes calculations in a school notebook, a bottle of beer close at hand.  MERYL appears in her robe, a glimpse of black negligee beneath, restless.  She throws her arms around Truman's neck. \nMERYL (suggestive) What are you doing?  Come to bed. \nTRUMAN (ignoring the suggestion) I figure we could scrape together eight thousand. \nMERYL (suddenly exasperated) Oh.  God, everytime you and Marlon-- \nTRUMAN --We could bum around the world for a year on that. \nMERYL And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager. \nTRUMAN Maybe I feel like a teenager. \nGetting to his feet.  Truman holds Meryl by the arms, talking excitedly to her the way we imagine he did when they were courting. \nTRUMAN Meryl, it'd be an adventure. \nMERYL We said we'd try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure? \nTRUMAN That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore. \nMeryl gives a derisive laugh. \nMERYL You want to be an explorer?  You mean like all the other great explorers from Queens? You don't even have a passport, Truman.  I bet you don't even know how to get one. \nThe words sting.  Truman turns away. \nSeeing the pain she's caused, she changes tack. \nMERYL This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then. (making one more attempt at seduction) Come to bed. \nFumbling with the gear stick. he finally finds reverse but turns to find a hostile group of PEDESTRIANS herded tightly together behind the car, leaving Truman with nowhere left to go. \nThe car door is suddenly jerked open and the out-of-breath PARKING ATTENDANT yanks Truman from the driver's seat. \nATTENDANT What the fuck are you trying to pull?! \nTRUMAN (cowering, the fight instantly gone out of him) I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!  No harm done! No harm done! \nATTENDANT (feverishly inspecting the fenders for dents, he finds none) I oughta fuck you up! \nThe Attendant looks into Truman's terrified eyes.  They get the better of him. \nATTENDANT Get the fuck outta here. \nThe Attendant shoves Truman's briefcase into his arms and brushes him aside.  As he departs, Truman notices that the traffic jam in the street and the mysterious crowd of pedestrians has dissolved. \nEXT.  BUS DEPOT.  DAY. \nRow after row of parked buses.  TRUMAN and MARLON exit an administration office.  Instead of heading for the exit, Truman begins marching down the first row of buses, inspecting the number painted on the rear of each one. \nMARLON What're you doing? (gesturing to the office) The man told you there's no such bus. \nTRUMAN He's lying.  Two, four, oh, six was definitely the number. \nMarlon stops walking.  Truman continues his inspection.  Seeing there is no reasoning with him, Marlon hurries to catch him up. \nTRUMAN I never believed he was dead. \nMARLON (trying to be patient) C'mon, Truman, a lotta times they don't find a body.  You know what the currents are like in that water. \nTRUMAN (shudders, a memory flashing in his head) You had to see his face when that wave hit. He wasn't scared Marion.  It was like he was expecting it, waiting for it.  He knew it was coming. \nMARLON Why would he fake it? (trying to make light) He's not Elvis Presley. \nTRUMAN (ignoring the joke, pondering the morning's events) You know what was really strange about today? An old woman with a little dog and a businessman, walking in opposite directions on the sidewalk, both react like clockwork. They force him onto a bus against his will, a bus that doesn't normally stop outside my building.  And when I'm giving chase, the bus never makes another stop and I get the feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians are working together to make sure I never catch up with it. \nMARLON (sarcastic) Oh, so now it's also the pedestrians and the buses and the cars?  What are you saying, the entire population of Lower Manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding out that your father staged his death to pursue a life as a street person?  Oh yeah, that makes sense. \nTruman has no answer.  We see an aerial shot of Truman and Marlon on a television screen, continuing to check the rows of buses, Marlon still marveling at Truman's obstinance.  They have come to the last bus in the final row.  Truman hangs his head.  The offending bus is not amongst them.  He makes towards the exit without comment and Marlon follows. \nUnseen by the pair, we focus on the ID number on one of the buses they have previously checked - \"2400\".  A single drip of black paint trickles off the last freshly painted digit. \nEXT.  MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY. \nTRUMAN and MARLON, drinking beer, sit in the rear doorway of Marion's delivery van, wholesale-sized boxes of candy stacked behind them. \nTRUMAN You think I imagined it, don't you? \nMARLON I think you're missing your dad. (trying to be delicate) The anniversary was yesterday, wasn't it? \nTruman is surprised Marlon remembered.  Marlon nods to the sidewalk. \nMARLON You got sand in your cuffs. \nTruman looks down at his feet.  A small, tell-tale pile of sand has poured out of his tight trouser cuff. \nTRUMAN Maybe you're right.  If only the old woman hadn't left her dog behind. \nWe see a flashback in Truman's head of the earlier scene in the Lower Manhattan street.  It confirms that the old woman's DOG was abandoned on the sidewalk. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT, QUEENS.  DAY. \nTRUMAN stands in the corridor of his mother's cramped, fussy. doilyed apartment with his older sister, RAQUEL, late forties, prematurely grey.  Through a doorway, the figure of his MOTHER is visible asleep in bed, despite the early hour.  Truman and Raquel speak in hushed tones to avoid waking her. \nRAQUEL Don't you dare go in. Truman.  I just got her off to sleep. \nTRUMAN It was Dad. I swear. \nRaquel fixes Truman with a contemptuous stare. \nRAQUEL Well, the next time he shows up. bring him over.  Until then, I'm not saying a word about this to Mom and neither are you. \nTRUMAN If it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Can you think of a reason he'd want to hide from us? \nRACQUEL I know a reason he'd want to hide from you. Look at how you treat us.  You live ten minutes away, we hardly see you from year to year and then you turn up with this story so insane you don't even believe it yourself.  Haven't you hurt her enough, Truman?  She already blames you. \nLauren wrings out her dress. \nLAUREN (to the sky, upset) Get me out of here.  I don't want to be here. \nLauren starts walking away. \nTRUMAN (confused, calling after her) What are you talking about?  Lauren!  Lauren! \nTruman runs after Lauren and holds her by the arms, forcing her to face him. \nLAUREN (distraught) My name's not Lauren!  It's Sylvia! \nTruman looks into her eyes and believes her. \nTHE PICTURE FAST-FORWARDS AGAIN AT HIGH SPEED FOR A MOMENT AND RETURNS TO NORMAL. \nTRUMAN and SYLVIA (as she is now called throughout the remainder of the movie) sit on the ledge of the pool - the same spot as Truman and the hooker, Veronica, seventeen years later.  As we have just seen imitated, Sylvia and Truman kiss with great delicacy.  Truman goes to say something but she covers his lips with her finger. \nSYLVIA In a minute someone's going to come and stop me talking to you. \nTRUMAN (looking around the deserted park) Who?  There's no one around. \nSYLVIA (covering his lips once again) You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan.  And your teacher, Sister Olivia said, \"You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore.\"  And all the other kids laughed. And you sat down. \nTRUMAN (incredulous) How do you know about that? \nSYLVIA It doesn't matter.  You've forgotten about that boy, Truman.  You got scared.  Just because something happens, doesn't mean you can't take another chance in your life. \nTRUMAN I don't understand. \nSYLVIA (looking over her shoulder nervously) There isn't much time.  Just listen. Everybody's pretending Truman.  Everybody but you. (pointing to the buildings on the horizon) Look at that project.  You think anybody lives there?  It's all for you, Truman. A show.  The eyes are everywhere. \nTRUMAN (protesting) Eyes?  Where? \nSYLVIA (frustrated, raving) Everywhere, disguised...Truman, they're going to fill your head with lies. You've got to make yourself deaf, you understand?  When you're afraid the most, it means you're on the right track.  Trust that boy.  Promise me you'll do that? \nTruman nods, unsure of the commitment he is making. \nSuddenly a 1962 Plymouth roars towards the fountain out of nowhere. \nSYLVIA (scared) I told you, Truman! \nThe car skids to a stop and a large MAN, 40ish, with a shock of dark hair jumps from the car.  The man yanks the frightened Sylvia to her feet causing her cardigan to fall to the ground. \nTRUMAN (shocked) Hey! \nMAN (to Sylvia) Get in the car, Lauren! \nTruman jumps up. \nTRUMAN (to the Man) Who are you?! \nMAN I'm her father! \nSYLVIA No he's not!  He's just saying that! Does he look anything like me?! \nTRUMAN Shut your mouth! \nThe man backhands Sylvia roughly across the face and bundles her into his car.  Truman rushes at the man. \nTRUMAN Leave her alone! \nThe man easily fends Truman off, knocking him to the ground. He slams shut the passenger door of the Plymouth. \nMAN (to Sylvia) I told you not to come here anymore! (to Truman, who is getting to his feet) Which one are you? \nTruman is suddenly struck dumb, the doubts start crowding back into his head. \nSYLVIA (calling out from the car) Don't listen to him, Truman.  Make yourself deaf.  Come find me. \nMAN (to Truman, getting into the car) Don't bother!  We're moving to Australia. New York's done something to her head. \nThe Plymouth roars away.  Truman stares after it and then turns back to the cardigan left on the ground. \nCHRISTOF (V.O.) Why did he say Australia?  Why couldn't he have said New Jersey? \nEXT.  TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.  MORNING. \nTRUMAN sits in his car, about to lace his coffee.  From inside the adjacent Elementary School gymnasium, he hears the familiar excited squeals and shouts of SCHOOL CHILDREN.  Truman suddenly throws aside his miniature of Jack Daniels and sprints across the parking lot and into the school. \nINT.  UTOPIA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.  MORNING. \nTRUMAN slams through the front doors into the reception area. It is deserted, no one stationed at the administration desk, the corridors empty.  He runs down a vacant corridor, pushing open classroom doors as he goes.  They are all unoccupied. \nFinally, he stands outside the gymnasium.  The childrens' voices can still be heard.  Truman takes a deep breath and bursts through the double doors. \nThe room is empty save for a large reel-to-reel tape recorder in the middle of the basketball court playing a continuous tape of childrens' voices.  The recorder is attached to speakers on tall stands facing the ventilation ducts.  Truman stares at the machine in disbelief. \nEXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING. \nTRUMAN exits the subway, still lost in thought.  He stops at the newstand and picks up a copy of Vanity Fair to resume his ritual search but his heart is not in it. \nHe starts his trek to work, pausing to stare at his reflection in the mirrored building, hoping that the Homeless Man will appear at his side once again.  But no one joins him. \nHowever, as Truman continues to stare, it is the building itself that takes his interest.  An imposing forty-story office building, a black, sheer mirrored box clad in the kind of reflective glass that shields its occupants from the world, a building Truman passes every day. \nAs usual, a steady stream of EMPLOYEES and VISITORS enter and exit the building's high-ceilinged lobby past an intimidating security desk manned by two UNIFORMED GUARDS.  Beyond security are banks of elevators, ferrying executives, clerical staff and delivery personnel to and from their floors of business. \nTruman abruptly enters the building.  He strides confidently past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs. \nSECURITY GUARD 1 (to Truman) Can I help? \nTRUMAN (sneaking a glance at the building directory) I have an appointment at, er...Diamond Enterprises. \nSECURITY GUARD 1 They went bust. \nThe second Security Guard is rising from his seat to block Truman's path to the elevators but Truman reads his mind and makes a dash for it. \nHe slips into an elevator just as the doors are closing, defeating the flailing arm of the pursuing guard.  A WOMAN EXECUTIVE in the elevator looks in horror at Truman.  The cause of her concern becomes all too apparent.  Looking beyond the woman, Truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator car. \nThe elevator is simply an opening into the body of the building. Truman pushes past the Woman to be confronted with the fact that the entire office block is nothing but a giant, empty shell with no floors above the ground floor. \nThe PEOPLE Truman has just witnessed entering the other elevators are milling around a refreshment table, sitting on folding chairs, changing their clothes behind temporary curtained cubicles or lining up to re-enter the bogus elevator cars.  Gradually, they all turn to gape at Truman, who in turn stares back, appalled. \nThe Security Guards suddenly appear at Truman's side and take him by the arm. \nSECURITY GUARD 1 You gotta leave. \nTRUMAN (riveted by the equally-stunned building occupants) What're they doing? \nSECURITY GUARD 2 You gotta leave. \nThe Guards frog-march Truman out of the huge facade towards an Emergency Exit. \nTRUMAN (not going quietly) Just tell me what the hell's going on? \nSECURITY GUARD 1 We're re-modelling. \nTRUMAN Like fuck!  What're they doing? \nEXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY. \nTRUMAN continues to struggle as the GUARDS usher him to the street. \nTRUMAN You don't tell me, I'll get you investigated! \nSECURITY GUARD 2 Investigate what?  You're trespassing! \nTruman sees there is no point in arguing further.  His shouts are attracting the interest of PASSERS-BY.  A thought occurs to him. \nHe starts to run along the street, suddenly entering another building at random.  An office block with a bank on the ground floor.  As he skirts the bank, he feels the eyes of the BANK STAFF and CUSTOMERS on him.  Is he so suspicious-looking or were they expecting him? \nTruman rushes to the elevators.  The lights above the doors show all the elevators on upper floors.  Frantic pressing of the elevator button gets no response.  Truman heads for the stairs but is intercepted by a BANK OFFICIAL who bars his way. \nOFFICIAL You can't-- \nTRUMAN (anticipating his response) --I know. \nTruman backs away out of the office and continues to run down the streets of Lower Manhattan's financial district.  Every building he encounters seems to have a SECURITY GUARD anticipating his arrival or a building OFFICIAL hanging a CLOSED FOR BUSINESS sign on the front door. \nHe feels the eyes of PEDESTRIANS.  Is he simply drawing attention to himself by his behavior?  Truman wheels around, trying to make eye contact with passers-by.  They shy away. Truman stops still, his head reeling. \nEXT.  TIMES SQUARE.  DAY. \nTRUMAN stands amidst a throng of TOURISTS and COMMUTERS marooned on Times Square.  Mesmerized by the two fast-moving rivers of vehicles flowing through the intersection. \nTruman stares down at the street, contemplating stepping out into the traffic.  However as his foot is poised, the stream of cars that passed so close by seconds earlier, now appear to be giving him a wider berth.  He steps off the sidewalk and. to an acompaniment of car horns, begins to wander back and forth without fear through the traffic, confident that each vehicle will take evasive action. \nSafely on the other side of the street, he stands in front of the window of an electronics store.  He watches a local TV news show covering the Santa Maria replica moored near Pier 13. \nHowever Truman is forced to look away when he glimpses his own face on another TV taking a feed from a camcorder aimed out the store window.  He shudders at his video reflection. \nINT.  DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY. \nTRUMAN'S face stares out from a televison monitor.  We slowly pull back to reveal that other smaller monitors surround the first until we find ourselves staring at a video wall in a room the size of a football field. \nThe curved bank of monitors, suspended by cables from the ceiling, gives the appearance of a giant patch-work mobile. Investigating the screens we discover surveillance pictures from all over New York City, covering every facet of Truman's life. Camera angles from the interior of Truman's house, his backyard, car, subway station, office, the deli he frequents, the seashore to which he is drawn, the park he visits with Veronica, the abandoned freeway where he golfs with Marlon, many of the locations strangely devoid of people. \nBeneath the video wall is a state-of-the-art mixing desk, its illuminated buttons glowing brightly in the gloom.  Facing the desk, several OPERATORS in high-backed, high-tech swivel chairs, wearing the slimmest of headsets.  SIMEON, a meticulous young man with a penetrating gaze, sits directly in front of the largest of the monitors, co-ordinating camera angles. \nCHRISTOF stands over Simeon's shoulder, staring intently at the live picture of Truman now seated at a streetside cafe, continuing to inspect his surroundings.  CHLOE hovers in the background. \nThere is an uncomfortable silence in the control room as the production crew feel themselves under scrutiny for the first time.  Christof leans forward and talks soothingly into a microphone on the control panel. \nCHRISTOF ...Everybody stay focused...remember who you are... \nEXT.  STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.  DAY. \nTRUMAN sits alone at the table, still looking for a false move. \nA DELIVERY MAN unloads boxes from the back of his truck and carries them into a Restaurant Supply store.  Further down the street CONSTRUCTION WORKERS take their time tending to an electrical repair in an exposed manhole.  A POSTAL WORKER does his rounds.  An OLD WOMAN struggles with two heavy shopping bags.  Everybody appears natural, places to go. \nTruman turns his attention to a group of ITALIAN-LOOKING MEN at the only other occupied table at the cafe.  We see extreme close-ups as Truman scans the men's faces for any sign of phoniness.  They are talking loudly, making suggestive comments to the WAITRESS and generally showing off like schoolboys. Their behavior passes the test, all seems genuine. \nTruman idly regards his three-stone wedding ring with which he has been fidgeting. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. \nThe on-air monitor shows TRUMAN from the ring's POV, revealing that the small center diamond contains a miniature, hidden camera.  Truman suspects nothing. \nHe looks up to find two well-to-do 3OGGERS, out for a lunchtime run, making their way down the street towards the cafe.  Truman happens to glance at the sneakers of one of the joggers.  He springs to his feet and blocks the joggers' path. \nCHRISTOF (staring at the monitor) Damn! \nUnseen by Christof, his Assistant Director, Simeon takes a moment of pleasure from the older man's distress. \nEXT.  STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.  DAY. \nTRUMAN (to the jogger with the familiar sneakers) Small world. \nJOGGER 1 (attempting to sidestep Truman) Excuse me. \nTruman blocks the man a second time. \nTRUMAN You don't remember?  Two days ago I gave you my meatball sandwich in the park.  You were in a wheelchair.  Same sneakers. \nAn almost subliminal flashback appears in Truman's head confirming that the JOGGER and the HOMELESS MAN in the wheelchair two days earlier are one and the same. \nTRUMAN (commenting ironically on his new-found mobility) A miracle! \nJOGGER 2 (coming to his companion's aid) Get the hell outta here. \nThe second jogger pushes Truman back against the cafe table causing him to stumble. \nEXT.  WAREHOUSE - MARLON'S WORK.  DAY. \nMARLON is loading boxes of candy into the back of his van. TRUMAN hurries up to him. \nTRUMAN Marlon. I've gotta talk to you. \nMARLON (surprised) Truman!  Sorry, I'm up against it today. \nTRUMAN I've fallen over something, Marlon. Something to do with my Dad. I think. \nMARLON (looking at him for the first time) Are you okay? You look like shit. \nTRUMAN (ignoring the inquiries about his health) It's big, Marlon.  You wouldn't believe who's in on it. \nTRUMAN sits on the clifftop, staring out at the view his father had been so desperate for him not to see twenty-seven years earlier.  However the deserted bay beyond is exactly as his father described - almost identical to its neighbor.  MARLON, laboring, crests the rise and joins his friend on the clifftop. \nMARLON What're we doing here, Truman? \nTRUMAN This is where it started. \nMARLON Where what started? \nTRUMAN Things.  Things that don't fit.  Loose threads. False steps.  Slips of the tongue. \nMARLON (irritated) Make sense, Truman.  You going religious on me? \nTRUMAN (tears of bitterness welling in his eyes) My father didn't want me to see what was over here. Whatever it was, it's gone now.  I never shoulda listened to him that day.  I knew it was wrong. \nWe see a quick flashback of SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN on the cliff- face twenty-seven years earlier. \nTRUMAN There were a hundred people on the beach that day.  Everybody knew what was going on except me. \nMARLON I don't want to put you down but why would anybody go to all this trouble over you? \nTRUMAN Maybe I've been mistaken for somebody else. (a memory triggered) A couple of years ago, I tried to get hold of a copy of Time Magazine.  The week before an ad said, \"Next Week:  Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation\". \nMarlon shrugs, unimpressed. \nTRUMAN A guy with the same name as me in Time Magazine.  It ain't a common name so I looked out for it.  But the day it came out, every newstand was sold out.  No library had it.  I even wrote off for a back-issue.  Never seen a copy to this day. \nMarlon remains unconvinced. \nTRUMAN Maybe I'm being set up for something.  You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something? \nMarlon looks skeptically at Truman.  He hasn't had that feeling. \nMARLON (becoming testy) A coincidence.  Haven't you ever heard of a coincidence? \nTRUMAN I'm a walking coincidence.  I can't count 'em. No something's happening, Marlon.  I've got to get to the bottom of it. \nMARLON (shaking his head in exasperation) Of what?!  Why're you doing this to yourself? \nTRUMAN I'm scared, Marlon.  I'm as scared as hell. But I've never felt more alive.  It's just like she said. \nMARLON (suddenly intrigued) Who? \nTRUMAN It doesn't matter.  She was too beautiful for here. \nNow Marlon is really confused. \nTRUMAN Can you lend me some money?  A hundred bucks. \nMARLON All I got on me is the takings from the machines. Why do you need it? \nTRUMAN I'm going away for a while. \nINT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DUSK. \nThe comfortably furnished room of a writer.  Walls lined with books.  Desk overlooking the sea, strewn with notes, photos and other reference material.  Sylvia's name on the spine of several published volumes.  Pages of unfinished manuscript, handwritten in blue ink. \nSYLVIA stands at a bookcase, looking for inspiration.  As she pulls out a book, a magazine falls to the floor.  Truman's missing copy of Time Magazine.  His face on the cover with the headline,  \"Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation\". \nSylvia retrieves the magazine.  In front of a nearby mirror, she holds Truman's photographed face next to her own, for a moment imagining them together.  Then, catching herself, she quickly lowers the magazine, left alone with her own reflection. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nWe see TRUMAN's disturbed face reflected in the screen of his television set, montaged over that of ROBIN LEACH, host of \"Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous\".  MERYL, wearing her robe, head against Truman's chest, sips from a bottle of beer. \nMERYL (attempting to open him up) What's going on, Truman?  You're not yourself. \nTRUMAN (vague) Maybe you just don't know me very well. \nINT.  DINING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT. \nCHRISTOF eats a sumptuous meal in an ornate private dining room with an elegant WOMAN, thirty years his junior.  Playing silently on a monitor on an antique side table is a surveillance shot of TRUMAN and MERYL slumped in front of their television. \nCHLOE, enters the room and nods an apology to Christof's dinner companion - a woman her own age.  Christof's companion shrugs resignedly.  Christof registers Chloe's thinly disguised resentment, enjoying the rivalry. \nChloe inserts a cassette tape into a nearby VCR.  Christof wipes his mouth with his napkin and picks up his wine glass as he gives the television his full attention.  A commercial for \"GLOBAL TRAVEL\" begins to play. \nTRUMAN Sorry, Sydney.  Sydney, Australia.  That's right. \nAGENT (entering the destination in her computer) For how many? \nTRUMAN (finding the question suspicious) One. \nAGENT When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, that you do lose a day on the way there? \nTRUMAN (more urgent than he intended) Today. \nAGENT (reading off her computer screen) I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for a week. \nTRUMAN (suspicious) A week. \nAGENT (patiently explaining) It's the busy season. \nTRUMAN (paranoia showing) You sure you're not trying to keep me here? You are a travel agent, aren't you?  Your job is to help people travel, not keep 'em where they are. (pointing to the agent's name tag, \"DORIS - Travel Agent\") Or maybe you're a different kind of agent, Doris? \nAGENT (showing amazing restraint) I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Australia tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that. \nTRUMAN Why wouldn't I? \nAGENT I thought you were in a hurry. \nTRUMAN (calming down) That's right. \nAGENT You want to book the flight? \nTruman pulls out a wad of money from his pocket and several rolls of quarters from Marlon's vending machines.  The agent looks askance at the pile of cash. \nTRUMAN You were expecting me, weren't you? \nThe travel agent ignores the question and prints the ticket. \nAGENT It's non-refundable. \nEXT.  SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.  DAY. \nCHRISTOF stands with a PRODUCTION MANAGER, mid-thirties, on the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House, its sail-like roofs soaring above them.  Framing the background, the coathanger-shaped Sydney Harbor Bridge. \nPROD. MANAGER (unable to conceal his pride) Happy? \nChristof gives a grudgingly complimentary nod. \nCHRISTOF (staring out at the pleasure craft littering the harbor) Can we contain him long enough? \nPROD. MANAGER I think so. \nChristof looks skyward at the cottonwool clouds above the harbor. \nPROD. MANAGER (anticipating his next question) He flies at night.  Thick cloud cover to disorient him.  Hopefully we'll knock him out with complimentary cocktails, pull the shades down during the movies.  He'll never know. \nChristof gives another grudging nod of approval.  The Production Manager is beckoned by a group of CONSTRUCTION WORKERS who are putting the finishing touches to a corner of the Opera House. CHLOE drifts to Christof's side, a Watchman TV in her hand. \nCHLOE (referring to the surrounding scene) Why go to all the trouble? \nChristof glances at the TV screen in her hand, showing TRUMAN sitting in his office gazing at his composite picture of SYLVIA. \nCHRISTOF He believes she has the answer. \nCHLOE Why not just tell him she's dead? \nCHRISTOF It's too late for that.  That won't satisfy him.  He's going to have to find out for himself. See it with his own eyes.  Right now he needs something genuine. (rueful, all too aware of the contradiction) Even if we have to fake it. \nINT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY. \nClose up on typewriting appearing on a page. \n\"Please accept my resignation from American Life & Accident, Inc. to take effect immediately. \nYours tru\" \nTRUMAN gets up from the typewriter in mid-word and strolls to a fellow AGENT's desk. \nTRUMAN (to agent, picking up a dictionary) \"Yours truly...\"  You spell \"truly\" \"l...y\" or \"e...l...y\"? \nTRUMAN (screaming above the baby's cries) Say my name!  You know my name!  Say it! \nYOUNG MOTHER (bewildered) I don't know you. \nThe commotion has attracted the attention of an OLD MAN across the street, watering his garden.  He drops his hose and hurries towards the fracas.  Halfway across the street, the old man stops in his tracks as he sees the baby, perilously poised in the air. \nTRUMAN (hysterical) I mean it!  I'm ready to do it! What's my name?!! \nTruman lifts the screaming baby as far above his head as he can, his arms shaking, fighting the urge to dash the fragile innocent to the concrete.  We see a view of the scene from the POV of a streetlight.  The young mother, recognizing Truman's seriousness, opens her mouth to speak but no sound comes. \nTRUMAN (entreating the young woman, tears in his eyes) This is your last chance! \nThe anguish in his voice convinces us that Truman is truly on the brink.  The young woman now has tears rolling down her cheeks.  She is at a loss, powerless. \nTRUMAN (his entire body shaking) What...is...my...name?! \nThe young woman mumbles but is unable to supply the name. Truman, arms shaking, face red with rage, realizes he can't go through with it.  With everything he has, he gathers himself. After what seems like an age, he ever so slowly lowers the child into the safety of the mother's outstretched arms. \nYOUNG MOTHER (clutching the baby to her breast, without thinking) Thank you, Truman. \nTruman shudders at the sound of his name and backs away from the young woman, as if it is she who now represents the threat. \nHe jumps into his car and slams it into gear, driving over the sidewalk and back onto the street.  The young woman and the old man stare after Truman's car as it roars away. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DAY. \nAs TRUMAN drives, he stares, paranoid, at seemingly innocuous features in his Oldsmobile - his rearview mirror, steering wheel insignia, speedometer, airconditioning ducts - and peers up at the streetlamps lining the roadway. \nINT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY. \nA dozen-or-so of SYLVIA'S FRIENDS, including the MAN we have seen before, sit around a table on the balcony in the afternoon sun, talking animatedly.  A TEN-YEAR-OLD SON of one of the guests has strayed into the living room and switched on the television set hidden away in an antique bureau. \nSYLVIA. emerging from the kitchen, is taken aback by what she sees playing on the screen.  The MAN on the balcony catches her look as she swiftly switches off the TV.  She gently takes the child's hand and leads him outside. \nEXT.  TRUMAN'S BACKYARD.  DAY. \nTRUMAN, staring at the freeway from the bottom of the garden. doesn't bother to look up as MERYL approaches. \nTRUMAN (referring to a distant car on the expressway) See that car way down there?  I bet it's a Suburu station wagon. \nMeryl looks idly over the fence at the approaching car. Finally a Suburu station wagon motors by.  Meryl is unimpressed. Truman turns his back on the Expressway to continue his game. \nTRUMAN I predict the next four cars will be a white Honda Civic, a blue and white Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing, a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender and a motorcycle. \nMeryl doesn't wish to participate in the game and makes for the house.  Truman holds her arm, forcing her to watch.  He turns to check his prediction.  A convoy of cars approaches. \nTRUMAN There's the Honda...the Dodge...here comes the dented Beetle... \nMeryl's attention wavers.  Truman tightens his grip. \nTRUMAN Look, damn you! \nFollowing the VW is a school bus. \nMERYL (mocking) Where's the motorcycle? \nTruman is momentarily disappointed.  Meryl seizes her chance and heads for the house.  Truman follows her inside. \nTRUMAN (yelling after her) Don't you want to know how I did that? Maybe you already know.  Is that it? \nBehind Truman's back, a motorcycle putters by. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  DAY. \nMERYL is pouring herself ice tea when TRUMAN enters. \nMERYL Where have you been?  I've been calling you all day. \nTRUMAN Have you been concerned, Meryl?  Nice name. \"Meryl\".  I always liked it. \nMERYL (matching his sarcasm) Nice of you to say so after eight years. \nTRUMAN Actress's name, isn't it?  What's your real name? \nMERYL (rolling her eyes) Oh, God.  What's got into you? \nTRUMAN (distraught, referring to the bed) How could you buy this damn thing when you know he drowned in front of me?! \nTruman raises the kitchen knife but instead of stabbing Meryl begins to slash viciously at the waterbed, opening a large gash. \nTRUMAN You have any idea what it's like to drown? \nTruman drops the knife and forces Meryl's head into the gaping hole in the bed, submerging her head in the tepid water.  She thrashes her arms wildly trying to free herself. \nTruman reluctantly jerks her head back out of the water. \nMERYL (gasping for air) Truman, stop it! (to the ceiling) Don't let him do it! \nTRUMAN (to a light fixture, threatening) I'll kill her! \nHe dunks her head into the water a second time, holding her head down longer this time.  She continues to struggle. \nSuddenly, the front door chimes.  Startled, Truman lets Meryl up for air. \nTRUMAN (sneering at Meryl) Right on time.  Cops must be telepathic. \nMeryl spots the kitchen knife within her reach but Truman beats her to it.  Grabbing the knife by the blade, he slices his hand. \nTRUMAN (wincing in pain) Damn! \nAt knifepoint, Truman marches Meryl down the hallway to the front door.  The doorbell chimes a second and third time, more insistently. \nTRUMAN (shouting through the closed door) Stay where you are or I'll kill her! \nMARLON (O.C.) Truman?  It's me, Marlon. \nTruman flinches.  He was so convinced it would be the police. He takes a step back against the hallway wall.  Before he can decide what to do, Marlon has opened the unlocked front door to be confronted with the sight of Truman holding the knife to Meryl's throat, blood streaming from his own wound. \nMarlon locks eyes on Truman.  Sizing up the situation, he slowly but decisively removes the knife from Truman's hand.  Meryl wrenches herself free from Truman's now limp grasp, and collapses into Marlon's arms, sobbing. \nMERYL (distraught, dropping character, forgetting herself) They were going to let him kill me! \nEXT.  ABANDONED FREEWAY.  NIGHT. \nMARLON and TRUMAN, both nursing bottles of beer, sit on the end of their abandoned freeway off-ramp. \nTRUMAN People know who I am, my every move, complete strangers know my name.  Even when there's no one around, I feel the eyes on me. \nMARLON (reluctant admission) I was in the bank today.  The Federal on Lewis.  A clerk was talking about somebody named Truman messing with her baby.  Is that the stranger you're talking about? \nTruman closes his eyes as he takes in the explanation. \nTRUMAN (half to himself, refusing to accept it) No.  No.  I've never seen her before. (registering Marlon's skepticism) I know you already think I'm going out of my mind but I genuinely believe the world revolves around me somehow.  Everybody seems to be in on it. \nMARLON It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself?  Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview with Barbara Walters? Who hasn't wanted to be somebody? \nTRUMAN That's just it.  I think I am somebody. \nMARLON (sympathetizing) I used to dream all my friends and family got together in a hotel room, thinking of ways to fuck me up. \nTRUMAN Sometimes I think it's in my head, sometimes I think it's for real. \nMarlon looks around as if drawing inspiration from somewhere in the night. \nMARLON Tru, we've known each other since before we could get a hard-on. \nTruman half-smiles at the ribald remark. \nMARLON The only way we ever made it through high school was cheating off each other's test papers.  Jesus, they were identical. I always liked that, because whatever the answer was, we was right together and we was wrong together. \nTruman nods fondly at the memory. \nMARLON The only night either of us ever spent in jail, we spent together and I wet myself but you never told anyone. I was best man at your wedding and my brother was best man at my wedding and you didn't talk to me for a month over that and I didn't blame you because you've been more of a brother to me than he's ever been.  And I never shoulda let my Goddam father talk me into that. \nTruman is slowly coming around.  Marlon's speech from the heart soothing away his pain. \nMARLON I know things haven't worked out for either of us like we used to sit up on Freemont Street all night and dream they would.  We all let opportunities pass us by, none of us asks for the dance as often as we should.  I know that feeling when it's like everything's slipping away and you don't want to believe it so you look for answers someplace else.  But, well, the point is, I would gladly step in front of traffic for you. \nTruman grins a melancholy grin, nearly all the way back.  We see a close up of Marlon's ear.  From inside, unheard by Truman, CHRISTOF dictates Marlon's heartfelt speech. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT. \nINTERVIEWER You're on, caller.  Go ahead. \nMALE CALLER 1 Christof, it's a great honor to speak with you. \nCHRISTOF Thank you. \nMALE CALLER 1 Truman has never been closer.  The way he looked directly at us, spoke to us for the first time. Do you think he'll ever work it out? \nCHRISTOF I don't believe so.  Not now.  He tested his world, as we all do at certain times, and eventually it passed the test.  You have to understand, he is a man made-for-TV, the world he occupies his only frame of reference. No, for him to come even this close to the truth is a remarkable testament to his instincts. \nThe Interviewer presses another line on his terminal. \nINTERVIEWER Sacramento, California, you're on \"Tru Talk\". \nMALE CALLER 2 (O.C.) How much of a strain has the last few days placed on the actors? \nCHRISTOF Working on \"Truman\" has always been a huge commitment for an actor, not just in terms of separation from friends and family, but since Truman essentially drives the plot, it's a never-ending improvisation.  Recent events have raised the pressure but also the prestige. \nINTERVIEWER (cutting off the call) Of course Truman has always been very much in on casting. \nCHRISTOF As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player. \nINTERVIEWER (pressing another line) Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with world-renowned videographer, Christof. \nMALE CALLER 3 (O.C.) Christof.  I've admired your work my whole life, although I can't say I've seen it all. \nCHRISTOF Who can? \nMALE CALLER 3 Can you settle an argument for me?  What's the longest time Truman has been off-camera? \nCHRISTOF (trace of pride) In his entire life, forty-two minutes.  A technical fault in 1978 accounts for most of that time.  The remainder generally results from blindspots, in the early days, when Truman would stray out of range of our cameras. \nINTERVIEWER The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them. (pressing another line) Amagansett, Long Island, you're on \"Tru Talk\". \nFEMALE CALLER 1 (O.C.) How can you say Truman lives a life like any other? \nCHRISTOF (sensing the thinly disguised resentinent in the caller's voice) I believe that to be so.  I often feel the only difference between Truman's life and our own is that his is being more thoroughly documented. We all play our allotted roles-- \nFEMALE CALLER 1 (O.C.) --He's not a performer.  He's a prisoner. \nThe Interviewer goes to cut off the call but Christof holds him back. \nCHRISTOF (rising to the challenge) --He can leave at any time.  If his was more than just a vague ambition, if he were absolutely determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him.  I think what really distresses you, caller, is that ultimately he prefers the comfort of his \"cell\"-- \nFEMALE CALLER 1 (as if trying to convince herself. giving herself away) --No, you're wrong!  He'll prove you wrong! He can still do it! \nCHRISTOF (a thought occurring, looking directly into camera) Do I know you, caller?  Your voice sounds familiar. \nINT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nSYLVIA, finger on the button of the phone where she has cut off the call, stares at CHRISTOF on her television screen. \nIt is she who is the Female Caller.  Christof seems to stare back at her as the talk show continues. \nINTERVIEWER (from television) Recording a human life from birth to death, that's still the intention?  You still believe Truman has more to contribute? \nCHRISTOF (still reflecting on the last call) More than ever.  By unwittingly allowing us to witness his struggles, he's constantly forcing us to evaluate our own lives.  He gives us hope. \nINTERVIEWER Let's take another call. (pressing a line) London, England you're on \"Tru Talk\". \nFEMALE CALLER 2 By definition Truman has to be free of censorship, but has the recent violence and profanity caused a problem for the sponsors...? \nSylvia shuts out the conversation on the television, focusing on the window that displays TRUMAN, still buried in his book. \nShe comes close to the screen, catching his melancholy.  She has a camera and a white envelope in her hand.  With a look of resolve, she takes her fountain pen and writes Truman's name on the envelope in her familiar blue ink. \nINT.  MASTER TAPE ROOM.  NIGHT. \nRow upon row of digital video cassettes occupy one entire, cavernous room - \"Truman\" and a date on the spine of each cassette.  Suspended from the ceiling, a monitor shows a live picture of TRUMAN sleeping on the sofa. \nSitting in front of a playback monitor, CHLOE is transfixed by Truman thirty-four years earlier, a FETUS in his mother's womb. \nCHRISTOF (O.C.) What are you looking for? \nChloe tries to conceal her startlement at CHRISTOF's unexpected entrance. \nCHRISTOF (O.C.) ...and, action background... \nAt the command, the PEDESTRIANS and VEHICLES begin inoving normally, TRUMAN exits the subway, suspecting nothing.  He begins his trek to work, accompanied by the cued rush hour traffic. \nCHRISTOF (O.C.) ...nice...nice...I like the woman with the dog... let's keep it moving...I want that traffic kept together...everybody look like you've got places to go... \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. \nCHRISTOF covers his microphone to deliver an aside to SIMEON, from whom he has temporarily assumed the role of director. \nCHRISTOF I bet he doesn't stop at the newstand. \nAs predicted, Truman walks by, barely glancing at a newspaper's banner headline, \"NUCLEAR POWER PLANT REOPENED\".  Christof scans the shot options available to him on the video wall. \nCHRISTOF ...Bodycam Two... \nThe large On-Air Monitor cuts to Truman, via the point-of-view of an approaching PEDESTRIAN.  For an instant, the unaware Truman looks directly into the lens of the disguised camera. \nCHRISTOF ...streetlight eight... \nThe monitor cuts to an overhead shot from a streetlamp.  The camera continues to follow Truman's progress. \nCHRISTOF ...ready, Car-Cam One.  Go to One... \nTRUMAN enters his office building as a taxi cruises by. \nCHRISTOF ...and cut to interior... \nTruman is immediately picked up by a hidden camera inside the building where he exchanges a half-hearted greeting with an ancient SECURITY GUARD. \nCHRISTOF ...looser... \nThe camera widens the angle. \nCHRISTOF ...and action, Vivien... (aside, proud of his casting) Looks just like Truman's mother at that age. \nVIVIEN, an insurance adjuster approaches the elevator button at the same time as Truman.  However she reaches for it after Truman has already turned his back. \nCHRISTOF (incensed) Damn, she missed her mark! (impatiently to Simeon) Why do we bother with walk-throughs if nobody pays attention?  Give me a two-shot of Truman and Vivien...go to the master ...hold the elevators... (mustering patience, into microphone) Vivien, press the elevator button again ...and make sure you catch his eye this time... \nINT.  INSURANCE OFFICE LOBBY.  DAY. \nA second time, TRUMAN's brief encounter with VIVIEN goes like clockwork.  As instructed, she hammers away at the elevator button and throws a conspiratorial look to Truman.  The elevator car duly arrives and Truman's eyes follow Vivien's rear as she sachets into the lift.  For a moment he appears to glance at a piece of gaffer tape on the marble floor. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. \nCHRISTOF Good!  Perfect!  Cut to the interior... \nThe monitor cuts to the inside of the elevator, rapidly filling with co-workers. \nCHRISTOF ...and Lawrence... \nJust as the doors are about to close, LAWRENCE oozes in.  He gives Truman a smug smile. \nCHRISTOF ...nice look, Lawrence...and, Vivien... \nThe elevator doors open and Vivien exits with two co-workers. \nLAWRENCE (admiring aside to the remaining fellow-males in the elevator) I wouldn't kick her out of bed. \nTruman doesn't seem to share Lawrence's enthusiasm for the comely young woman.  He is miles away. \nINT.  STUDIO - CONFERENCE ROOM.  DAY. \nAssembled around a long oval table for a story confernce are several principal characters in Truman's life - MERYL, MARLON, ERROL, TYRONE, RAQUEL, VERONICA and the new actress, VIVIEN, sitting slightly apart from the rest of the cast. \nCHRISTOF takes his place at the head of the table, a large monitor showing TRUMAN drinking coffee in his cubicle at American Life plays silently behind Christof's head. \nCHRISTOF (to the meeting, referring to Meryl by her real name) Regrettably, I have to inform you that Hannah has chosen not to renew her contract. \nAll eyes turn to Meryl.  She looks at the floor. \nCHRISTOF I'm sure we can all respect her reasons. \nMeryl receives a sympathetic squeeze of the hand from her co- star Marlon, now out of wardrobe, wearing an Armani suit. \nEXT.  VACANT LOT.  DAY. \nTRUMAN rolls in the dirt of a construction site, tearing at his clothes and caking his face and hair with black inud. \nHe struggles up a slope onto an adjacent roadway where a shopping cart awaits, loaded with soiled plastic bags. Looking every inch a derelict, Truman begins to wheel his shopping cart through the empty streets of Brooklyn. \nEXT.  BROOKLYN BRIDGE.  DAY. \nTRUMAN wheels his shopping cart over a deserted Brooklyn Bridge. Over his shoulder, in the far distance, we see a lone car approaching.  As it nears, we recognize a police car. \nTruman takes a look under the bridge, as if participating in the search.  The car slowly draws alongside, the POLICE OFFICER looking straight into Truman's blackened face. \nPOLICE OFFICER Any sign of him? \nTRUMAN (deliberately gravelling his voice) Not yet. \nThe Police Officer takes a second look at Truman.  After what seems like an eternity, he motions his PARTNER to drive on. \nPOLICE OFFICER (to Truman, as the car pulls away) Take it easy. \nEXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN.  DAY. \nWe pan down one concrete canyon after another.  The usually bustling financial district is totally, eerily deserted. \nSuddenly we see a line of PEOPLE fanned out across a street. Then another and another. \nPEOPLE of every description, shoulder to shoulder, marching down the otherwise empty streets the way a search is conducted at a crime scene.  The lines include PRINCIPALS and EXTRAS linked arm in arm, wardrobed for their usual roles as EXECUTIVES and SECRETARIES, STORE CLERKS, TELEPHONISTS, MAINTENANCE and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, WAITERS and WAITRESSES, COOKS, SHOPPERS, HEALTH WORKERS, SECURITY GUARDS, POSTAL WORKERS, POLICE OFFICERS, FIRE FIGHTERS AND HOMELESS PEOPLE.  On one occasion we glimpse Truman's colleagues, LAWRENCE, ERROL and VIVIEN, amongst the searchers. \nA building-to-building, floor-to-floor, office-to-office search is also being conducted, each structure secured as they go, the searchers paying special attention to potential blind spots such as closets, dumpsters, man holes, sewers, car trunks, trees and shrubbery. \nWe focus on one of the waves of searchers.  TRUMAN has linked arms in the middle of a row, his disguise still holding up. \nA swarm of helicopters fills the sky. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. \nWhile his COLLEAGUES monitor the bank of screens, CHRISTOF has been joined by the two ever-anxious studio executives, MOSES and ROMAN. \nMOSES (to Christof who is still studying the faces in a row of SEARCHERS) Rumors are circulating he's dead. \nROMAN (pacing nervously) The sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts. \nCHRISTOF (unconcerned, referring to the static \"STAND BY\" graphic, now accompanied by soothing classical music) Why?  We're getting higher ratings for that graphic than any time in the series. \nINT.  BARROOM.  DAY. \nThe television behind the bar carries the still graphic. BAR PATRONS animatedly discuss Truman's fate over their drinks. Some place bets with each other over the outcome. \nEXT.  ELECTRONICS STORE.  DAY. \nA crowd of PASSERS-BY hover around a display of televisions in the window of an electronics store, awaiting developments. \nINT.  LIVING ROOM.  DAY. \nThe two OLD WOMEN we have seen before stare intently at the graphic on their televisions. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. \nThe fan of EXTRAS reaches the harbor and automatically turns to make another sweep. \nCHLOE (referring to the empty streets) When we flush him out how do we explain this? \nCHRISTOF (deadpan) We tell him the truth. \nChloe looks askance at Christof. \nCHRISTOF (joking darkly) We're making a movie. \nSIMEON (hopeful) We'll get him on this next sweep. \nCHRISTOF What have we missed? \nSIMEON It's just a matter of time. \nCHRISTOF No.  We've missed something. \nEXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY. \nTRUMAN hears a helicopter overhead.  By now the ocean spray has washed most of the dirt from his face, only a residue remains. The rags he wears, including Sylvia's sweater under his open coat, are soaked.  Her picture clings stubbornly to the compass. \nAs he steers, he occasionally refers to a \"HOW TO SAIL\" book from his coat pocket.  He tacks against the wind, as he watches the military chopper circle his boat. \nCHOPPER PILOT (over P.A.) Alter course immediately.  You are entering a restricted area. \nTruman screams defiantly back to the chopper. \nTRUMAN Fuck you! \nEXT.  A STREET SOMEWHERE.  DAY. \nTwo YOUNG MEN on a street corner watch, transfixed, the image of TRUMAN steering the Santa Maria on a portable Watchman TV. \nYOUNG MAN 1 I knew he wasn't dead. \nINT.  HELICOPTER.  DAY. \nThe HELICOPTER PILOT continues to circle. \nPILOT (over P.A.) Alter course or we fire on your vessel. \nTRUMAN screams again at the chopper and gestures wildly at the pilot. \nTRUMAN Get the hell away!  It's my life! \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. \nCHRISTOF (into microphone to pilot, eerily composed) Fire a warning. \nEXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY. \nA round of machine gun fire strafes the water across the bows of Truman's boat, several rounds striking the deck.  TRUMAN flinches.  In his eyes we see the ghosts return.  With great effort he shakes the doubts from his head and retrieves a flare gun from the storage cabinet in the boat's wheel house. \nCHOPPER PILOT (over P.A.) Alter course.  Drop your sails. \nTruman takes aim at the chopper and fires the flare gun.  The distress flare hurtles towards the hovering helicopter, narrowly missing.  Truman ejects the spent cartridge and reloads. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. \nSIMEON (shocked at the near miss) Jesus!  God!  Is he out of his mind? \nCHRISTOF (composed, into microphone to pilot) Pull back. \nEXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY. \nBefore the chopper can take evasive action TRUMAN takes aim a second time and fires.  The distress flare fishtails into the sky and to Truman's surprise and delight, finds its mark, striking the rear rotor blade.  Truman lets out a whoop. \nThe helicopter immediately begins to spiral downwards towards the sea.  The CHOPPER PILOTS bail out of the cockpit, splashing down safely into the coean while the helicopter enters the waves in a spectacular belly flop, sinking out of view in seconds like a stone.  Watching the pilots bobbing around in the ocean in their inflatable life jackets, thoughts of duty invade Truman's head.  He shuts out the thoughts and turns his back, steering away from the drifting pilots.  A look of resolve in his eyes we have never witnessed before. \nINT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY. \nSYLVIA kneels on the floor in front of the television.  As Christof's cameras dwell on her likeness - the composite picture still covering the ship's compass - she allows herself a brief moment of satisfaction but she does not dare to hope too much. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. \nCHRISTOF, CHLOE, SIMEON, and the OTHERS have been joined in the control room by MARLON, MERYL, KIRK and AUDREY. \nCHRISTOF How long will another chopper take? \nSIMEON By the time we pick up the pilots, too long. \nCHRISTOF We have to stop him for his own good. Turn him back with the elements. \nSIMEON (hesitant) There's no rescue boat in the area.  He won't know what to do. \nMOSES (trying to appeal to Christof's sense of reason) For God's sake, Chris.  The whole world is watching.  We can't kill him in front of a live audience. \nCHRISTOF He was born in front of a live audience. (never taking his eyes from the screen, reassuring) Don't worry, he's not willing to risk his life for the truth.  His doubts will turn him back. \nSimeon reluctantly turns to a panel of controls on the desk marked \"WAVE\", \"WIND\" and \"RAIN\".  After typing in a command, he winds the controls towards their maximum settings. \nCHRISTOF Kill the lights. \nTRUMAN's cry echos around bars, offices, shops, homes and streets - wherever a television is to be found.  No VIEWER speaks.  They are stunned to silence, many teary eyed. \nEXT.  CYCLORAMA.  DUSK. \nAs the boat drifts alongside the seemingly never-ending curve of the cyclorama, TRUMAN's attention is drawn to an outline in the otherwise flawless backdrop.  He clambers to the prow of the boat. \nThere, camoflaged in the painted skyscape just above the water line, is a door.  Truman grabs hold of the recessed doorhandle and halts the drifting boat.  He stands in front of the door and closes his eyes in a silent prayer. \nHe opens the door in the sky and steps through. \nINT/EXT.  VIEWERS.  DUSK. \nSpontaneous cheers and shouts of joy erupt from VIEWERS in their various locations - bars, homes and offices.  Strangers hug each other and dance in celebration. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK. \nEven the cynical VIDEO OPERATOR jumps out of his seat - for the first time in the film - and lets out a joyous whoop, forgetting himself for a moment, caught up in the drama. \nOPERATOR Yeah! \nSelf-conscious, he takes his seat again almost immediately.  His COLLEAGUES are transfixed by the live on-air monitor continuing to play its only available shot, the open door in the sky - Truman out of view. \nINT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK. \nTRUMAN finds himself on a small metal landing.  A steel ladder rises above him to the height of \"sky\", the soundstage roof, so high as to be barely visible.  The rungs also continue downward, the depth of the \"ocean-bed\", to a studio floor far below. \nTruman turns and looks back through the door he has just entered.  Unsecured, the Santa Maria is beginning to drift away. The sea he has feared since childhood, is nothing but an enormous tank.  The sky, a massive cyclorama.  New York City, an elaborate set.  And it is all housed within an impossibly large soundstage. \nTruman makes no effort to save the boat.  He shuts the door to his world.  A sign on the back of the door reads, \"CLOSED SET. No Unauthorized Access.\"  Gradually he becomes aware of another strange phenomenon taking place in the soundstage.  All around him, thousands of light fixtures mounted in the cyclorama to masquerade as stars, are slowly illuminating - switched on by an automatic timer.  (The light fixtures match the one that almost struck Truman's car at the beginning of the film.) \nBy artificial starlight, Truman begins his long descent of the step ladder.  Below, a studio tram makes its way along the soundstage perimeter, on the last tour of the day. \nINT.  STUDIO TRAM.  DUSK. \nAs he drives, a well-scrubbed, young TOUR GUIDE delivers his tired commentary into a microphone for the thousandth time to the half-full tram of STUDIO VISITORS. \nGUIDE ...the soundstage roof houses over eight hundred thousand lights of varying intensities to faithfully recreate the constellations... \nHowever, the passengers are paying less attention than usual. They stare, perplexed, at the television monitor above the Guide's head, continuing to play the show's only available shot of the open door in the sky. \nINT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK. \nTRUMAN suddenly steps in front of the tram.  The TOUR GUIDE stands on the brakes, tram lurching to a stop.  The Guide looks from Truman's haunted face to the monitor, hardly able to believe his eyes. \nTruman leaps on board, pressing his flare gun into the side of the guide's head. \nTRUMAN (to the shocked passengers) Nobody move! (to the guide) Drive! \nThe terrified Guide pulls jerkily away in the tram, resuming the tour. \nTRUMAN (to the guide, gesturing to the microphone) Keep talking.  Say whatever you say! \nThe Guide hesitantly resumes his commentary into his microphone. \nGUIDE Er,...the ocean tank contains over six hundred and fifty million gallons of man-made salt water, temperature-controlled... \nTruman's attention drifts to the logo on the side of the tram - \"TRUMAN STUDIO TOUR\".  He is suddenly aware of the tourists gawking at him. \nTRUMAN (to TOURIST, camcorder around his neck) Act normal!  Keep filming! \nTruman ducks out of sight as a fleet of STUDIO SECURITY CARS speeds towards the tram.  But they streak past, on their way to the site of Truman's escape.  As he tentatively gets back to his feet, Truman finds a CHILD standing in front of him with an autograph book. \nCHILD Please, Mister Truman. \nOn the child's T-shirt, a large photograph of Truman's face. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK. \nCHRISTOF talks anxiously on the phone, unaware of a shift in the balance of power taking place behind his back.  The executives, MOSES and ROMAN are huddling with SIMEON, making him an offer he appears to welcome. \nCHRISTOF (into the phone) What do you mean he's not there?  We can't have lost him again. \nOn the far side of the control room, behind a huge curved glass wall on a mezzanine floor, a studio tour tram passes by. \nINT.  STUDIO TRAM.  DUSK. \n", "test1_input": "EXT.  CAR WASH.  DUSK. \nTRUMAN ruefully examines the broken car aerial on his freshly washed Oldsmobile.  In the background is the warning sign he has just ignored, \"CLOSE WINDOWS, LOWER AERIALS\". \nTruman removes the metal coathanger from beneath the lavender cardigan and forces the bent wire into what's left of the severed aerial. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK. \nTRUMAN motors down a busy shopping street, crowded on both sides with PEDESTRIANS.  As he drives, he tests his car radio. Adjusting the tuner knob, he finds a station. \nFEMALE VOICE (from radio) ...west on Atlantic...he's making a right on Woodhaven... \nTruman glances up at the street signs along his route and finds that they coincide exactly with the streets quoted on the radio. Distracted, he almost bowls over an OLD LADY on a crosswalk. \nMALE VOICE (from radio) ...God, Truman almost hit Marilyn!...he's on the move again, passing the Burger King... \nTruman readjusts the radio as it starts to fade out. Suddenly there is a piercing blast of feedback.  He looks up and, as far as the eye can see, every PEDESTRIAN, MOTORIST and SHOPKEEPER along the street suddenly winces in pain and holds their right ear at exactly the same moment. \nMALE VOICE (from radio, in distress himself) ...something's wrong.  Change frequencies... \nTruman tries to pick up the channel once again but without success. \nEXT.  DRUG STORE.  DUSK. \nStill shaken by his experience with the radio, TRUMAN exits a Drug Store with a small, brown paper bag.  Out of the corner of his eye he catches a MALE BYSTANDER still checking his right ear with his finger.  He goes to say something to the by-stander but thinks better of it. \nEXT.  REDLIGHT DISTRICT, QUEENS.  NIGHT. \nHOOKERS in white heels and spray-on skirts display their wares. TRUMAN cruises slowly past in his Oldsmobile, the expression of the prostitutes turning from seductive to contemptuous as each is by-passed. \nSuddenly Truman pulls sharply into the curb beside a leggy, prostitute, VERONICA, wearing a platinum blonde wig.  She is in deep discussion with a fellow WORKING GIRL.  Veronica recognizes the car and instantly bends down to the open passenger window. \nVERONICA Hey, Truman!  Where you bin?  You bin cheatin' on me? \nVeronica opens the door and folds herself into the passenger seat. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  NIGHT. \nVERONICA knows the form.  As TRUMAN pulls away from the curb, she is already removing the lavender cardigan from the drycleaning bag on the back seat.  She drapes the cardigan around her shoulders. VERONICA Bout time you got this thing cleaned. (half-joking) Don't tell me you bin makin' your old lady wear it. \nTruman passes her the brown paper bag without reply.  Veronica removes a bottle of perfume and proceeds to liberally apply it. \nVERONICA (examining the bottle) God, do they still make this stuff? What's the Sell-By Date? \nINT.  FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.  NIGHT. \nFrom a vantage point in a disused tower high above the park. CHRISTOF and CHLOE watch as Truman's Oldsmobile enters the park grounds and comes to a stop near the large metal framed globe, the Unisphere.  Both Christof and Chloe wear earpieces, a miniature television propped at their feet shows a close-up picture of TRUMAN and VERONICA inside the car. \nCHLOE (into a flip-phone, condescending) ...you see him messing with the antenna...what did you think would happen?...\"lapse of concentration\", is that what you call it? I call it amateur-hour... (sarcastic) In case you hadn't noticed, we don't get to do it over. \nChristof, totally unfazed, regards his zealous young assistant with affection and even a mild amusement. \nCHLOE (as she hangs up, querying the smile that plays around his lips) You think this is funny? \nCHRISTOF The mask has slipped before.  Everything can be explained. \nTRUMAN kills the lights and he and VERONICA exit the car unaware that they are being observed. \nCHRISTOF (adopting a more serious tone as he returns his attention to Truman) What's dangerous is that he makes the connection between what happened today and the girl. \nWe focus on Truman and Veronica as they take a seat at the edge of the pool surrounding the great steel globe. \nVERONICA Like I say, I don't normally do this. I gotta charge extra. \nTruman nods his agreement and forks over several bills. Veronica deposits the money in her purse and perches herself as modestly as possible on the edge of the fountain. \nWhen she is ready, Truman tenderly places his arm around her shoulder.  Veronica responds, hesitantly, becoming immersed in her role.  She reaches out her own hand and rests it on the nape of his neck.  Slowly both heads drift together, but stop just short of their lips meeting, agonizingly close.  So close they can feel each other's breath, barely a sliver of daylight separating them.  Then finally their lips touch in the most gentle of caresses. \nThey hold the kiss for another long moment and then simultaneously break.  As they look into each other's eyes, Truman goes to say something but Veronica hushes him by placing a finger to his lips.  Then abruptly she moves out of frame, the cardigan falling from around her shoulders in her haste. \nFrom Truman's POV we focus on the cardigan on the pavement, triggering a flashback in his head. \nINT.  HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.  DAY, SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER. \nAs with Truman's previous flashbacks, this scene appears to be playing on a television screen.  However, on this occasion it is also accompanied by CHRISTOF's comments from his perch in the tower above the park. \n", "test1_true": "A SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, carrying a stack of books, spies LAUREN, sixteen going on thirty-five, wearing the lavender, beaded cardigan at her open locker.  She is entertaining two GIRLFRIENDS with what appears to be a lewd tale. \nCHRISTOF (V.O.) We'd noticed them making eyes at each other for some weeks but never thought he'd say anything.  She was a year older, wrote poetry, way out of his league... \nTruman, obviously terrified, musters the nerve to approach the lockers.  The three girls look up, surprised by the interruption. \nTRUMAN (to Lauren, tongue-tied, a strangled greeting) Hi. \nGIRLFRIEND 1 (to Lauren as the two girlfriends abruptly depart) See you in class. \nLauren is unsure whether or not to follow her friends. \nTRUMAN Lauren, right? \nHer name is carefully written in blue ink on the covers of her text books. \nLAUREN No. \nTRUMAN (ignoring her lack of interest) Look.  I was wonder-- \nLAUREN --I can't go out with you. \nTRUMAN I haven't asked you yet. \nLAUREN Well when you do, that's my answer. (softening) I'm sorry.  It's not up to me. \nTRUMAN (summoning up courage from somewhere) Why, you married? \nLauren smiles despite herself. \nTRUMAN I'm not asking you to have my children, just a pizza.  How about Saturday? \nLAUREN (adamant) No. \nTRUMAN Friday? \nLauren looks around the deserted school corridor. \nLAUREN Now. \nTRUMAN Right now?  We got finals. \nLAUREN If we don't go now, it won't happen. \nTruman hesitates. \nLAUREN (impatient, looking anxiously around) Well, what do you want to do? \nTHE PICTURE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN SUDDENLY FAST-FORWARDS AT SUCH SPEED IT BECOMES A BLUR - THEN RETURNS TO NORMAL SPEED. \nEXT.  FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.  DUSK. \nThe SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN and LAUREN enter the park near the Unisphere.  The park is deserted on a hot June afternoon. \nCHRISTOF (V.O.) We knew we were taking a risk.  She hadn't been properly coached, but we were torn... He'd summoned the courage to make the approach...We wanted to reward that.  Of course she took full advantage... \nTruman and Lauren run up to the ledge of the pool surrounding the steel sculpture. \nLAUREN I never knew this place existed. \nThey both stare down at the inviting water.  Lauren suddenly throws off her cardigan and jumps into the pool without another thought.  She comes splashing to the surface.  Truman stares down, transfixed hy the shimmering water. \nLAUREN Come on!  Come on!  It's wonderful! \nTRUMAN (nervous) I...I can't. \nLauren suddenly stops splashing. \nLAUREN That's right.  Oh, God, I'm sorry. \nShe quickly climbs out of the pool, dripping wet. \nTRUMAN (confused) Why? You've got nothing to be sorry about. Has someone been talking to you? \n", "test1_id": 2346, "test2_input": "Truman floors the Oldsmobile.  The car flies past the exit for Route 276.  He continues along the Jersey Turnpike. \nMERYL Truman, that was the turnoff! \nTRUMAN I've changed my mind again.  What's Maine like this time of year?! I've never been to Maine. (Truman looks up through the windshield at a helicopter tracking his progress) Or let's just see where the road takes us. \nMERYL (pleading) Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head. You wanna destroy yourself, you do it on your own! \nTRUMAN (eerily calm) I think I'd like a little company. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK. \nCHRISTOF, CHLOE, SIMEON and the other OPERATORS follow Truman's progress from a helicopter shot - the Oldsmobile optically circled to ease identification.  Christof jabs his finger at the rapidly thinning traffic surrounding Truman's vehicle. \nCHRISTOF (to Simeon) What the hell is wrong with the \"carousel\"? Keep them together. \nSIMEON (agitated) They're rusty.  We can't keep up. (rueful aside) We don't know where he's going any more. \nCHLOE Oncoming is very thin. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK. \nAs he speeds erratically, TRUMAN glances at the streets either side of the freeway, where he discovers a distinct lack of moving traffic. \nTRUMAN (to the anxious Meryl at his side) Look down there, Meryl!...No cars!  I don't run into traffic.  The traffic follows me around. (excited by his discovery) We're in a moving pack, don't you see? \nTruman abruptly exits the rapidly emptying freeway. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK. \nCHRISTOF (enthusing) He's so close!  It's tantilizing! \nCHLOE You want to pull him over? \nCHRISTOF No police.  Not yet.  We shadow him. We don't want him to panic. \nCHLOE He's trying to outrun the traffic. \nCHRISTOF He's trying to outrun the world.  Keep him on this route. (to Simeon who is consulting someone on his headset) Are we ready? \nSimeon nods.  Executives, MOSES and ROMAN have entered the control room.  They hover nervously in the background. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S CAR, WESTCHESTER.  DUSK. \nTRUMAN is forced to slow once again behind a line of other cars at a police roadblock.  At the head of the line, the cars are being turned around by POLICE OFFICERS, who are also contending with a swarm of NEWS REPORTERS and TELEVISION CREWS. \nTRUMAN (to Meryl) It's hard to go places, isn't it? \nMERYL There's been an accident, Truman.  We have to go back. \nTRUMAN No.  There's no accident.  It'S just more stalling. \nTruman slows beside a POLICE OFFICER. \nTRUMAN What's going on? \nOFFICER (grim-faced, indicating the nearby Indian Point nuclear power plant) Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down. \nTRUMAN Is there any way around? \nOFFICER The whole area's being evacuated.  A precaution. \nTruman falls in line behind the cars making a U-turn when, all of a sudden, he guns his car and swerves past the barricade. \nEXT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DUSK. \nIn the twilight sun, SYLVIA'S GUESTS wander up the gravel path, leading away from the beach house, the younger children carried in their parents' arms.  Hanging back from the rest of the group, Sylvia's admirer, wheeling his bicycle, turns back to the house.  As the MAN is about to lean his bicycle against the side of the beach house, he looks in a window. \nLit by a blue-glow, SYLVIA sits transfixed by the television playing in her antique bureau, the screen obscured from our view.  She is unaware of the man's face at the window. \nRecognizing what is playing on the screen, the man regards Sylvia with a resigned smile.  He mounts the bicycle and rides back up the path. \nEXT.  NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  DUSK. \nTruman's car slides to a stop, blocked by Hazardous Waste vehicles straddling the roadway leading up to the power plant, the pursuing police car blocking his retreat.  TRUMAN flees the car, leaving MERYL in the passenger seat. \n", "test2_true": "Truman bursts past the alien-looking HAZARDOUS WASTE WORKERS in their protective suits carrying detection instruments.  The workers give chase in their cumbersome suits, trying to cut off his path to the power plant.  As he crests a slight rise beyond the plant, he is finally tackled to the ground.  However, peering through the long grass, Truman is able to make out the lights of a cityscape in the distance. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK. \nCHRISTOF, a trace of panic in his eyes, turning to CHLOE. \nCHRISTOF Did he see it? \nCHLOE I don't think so. \nThe reason for Christof's concern becomes all too apparent as the helicopter passes over the power plant, where the struggling TRUMAN is being escorted away.  We see an aerial shot from the helicopter as it emerges directly above the Sydney skyline. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT. \nMERYL and TRUMAN sit at their kitchen table.  Truman stoic, tears rolling down Meryl's cheeks.  Truman's airline ticket torn to shreds on the table in front of them. \nMERYL Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well. \nTRUMAN (ignoring her tears and medical advice) Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me. \nMERYL That's not true. \nTRUMAN (suddenly angry) Don't lie to me! \nTruman's raised voice backs Meryl to her feet.  Truman follows, getting in her face. \nTRUMAN Tell me what's happening?! \nMERYL (frightened but remaining poised) I thought you knew everything.  What could I tell you? \nTRUMAN (backing her up against the kitchen bench) You're part of this, aren't you?! \nMeryl grabs a kitchen knife from a wooden block to protect herself. \nMERYL Truman, you're scaring me! \nTruman looks in her eyes and, with surprising swiftness, grabs her wrist and disarms her. \nTRUMAN No, you're scaring me, Meryl! \nTruman grabs Meryl by the hair and turns the knife on her. While pressing the blade to Meryl's throat, Truman starts to march her around the room, talking to the walls, light fixtures, a mirror, doorknob, framed picture, blank television. \nTRUMAN Stop this now or I kill your leading lady. (to a lamp) I know you can hear me. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT. \nCHRISTOF and the OTHERS watch the monitors spellbound as TRUMAN looks directly into one camera lens after another.  ROMAN is the first to crack. \nROMAN (entreating Christof) Get somebody in there! \nCHRISTOF (quiet but firm) No. \nSIMEON (siding with the executive, showing his true colors) She's in trouble!  We've got to help her! \nChristof, never taking his eyes from the monitor, leans into the microphone. \nINT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT. \nWe see an extreme close up of MERYL's ear.  Unheard by TRUMAN, from her inner car, we hear a familiar voice. \nCHRISTOF (O.C.) He's bluffing.  Call his bluff. \nMERYL (in reply to the voice in her head, half-strangled due to the pressure of the knife) Do something... \nUpon hearing her remark, Truman's eyes widen.  Sensing that she too is addressing a third person, he jerks her head around to read her face. \nTRUMAN (wild-eyed) Who are you talking to?! \nMERYL (incredulous) You're the one talking to the walls! \nTRUMAN No.  You said, \"Do something.\"  Who were you talking to?  I swear I'll kill you, if you don't tell me. \nMeryl takes the chance to spin out of his grasp and dashes to the bedroom but before she can barricade the door, Truman forces his way inside.  They both tumble onto the waterbed causing it to rock back and forth.  Gripping Meryl's hair, Truman throws aside the bed covers. \n", "test2_id": 2347, "test3_input": "SIMEON (shrugs) That loser pays our salary. \nOPERATOR He's given up on himself again. \nSIMEON Who cares?

He is what he is. \nAt the far end of the great room, one of the large double doors opens and CHRISTOF enters, as always accompanied by CHLOE, carrying a leather-bound folder.  Simeon and the Operators subtely straighten in their chairs.  Christof pretends not to notice.  He is staring intently at the On-Air monitor. \nCHRISTOF When did he start sleeping like that? \nSIMEON About the time Meryl left. \nCHRISTOF Is that the best shot we can get? \nSIMEON What's to see? \nChristof watches Truman, a trace of concern in his eyes. \nCHRISTOF (referring to the debris in Truman's bedroom) What happened to the room? \nSIMEON He started to reorganize.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep. \nApparently satisfied, Christof turns to an operator. \nCHRISTOF I want to check the set-ups for tomorrow's insurance convention. \nReading off the notes in Chloe's folder, the operator punches up a batch of camera angles on smaller preview monitors.  They show a generic-looking Marriott Hotel, devoid of actors.  A banner in reception reads, \"WELCOME AMERICAN LIFE & ACCIDENT\". The Operator looks to Christof for approval and realizes his producer's attention has wandered.  Christof is staring at the sleeping figure of Truman on the On-Air monitor. \nCHRISTOF Give me a shot from his wedding band. \nSIMEON (pointing out the ring on Truman's bedside table) He took it off. \nCHRISTOF (a trace of concern) Why is he so still?  He's too still. \nChristof picks up a spare headset from the panel and puts it to his ear. \nCHRISTOF Isolate the audio in the cans and amplify. \nAn operator pushes up an audio fader on the panel.  Christof and his colleagues listen to Truman's steady breathing in their headphones.  Simeon and the Operators nod, reassured that nothing is amiss.  Christof is not so easily convinced. \nCHRISTOF Give me a preview.  An ECU on his torso. \nA camera hidden in the room's bedside lamp zooms in to Truman's prone outline...while the breathing remains steady, the body does not rise and fall. \nCHRISTOF (anxious, barking a command to Chloe) Phone him. \nChloe picks up a phone connected to the desk and dials. \nCHRI STOF (anticipating Chloe's question) Wrong number. \nThe phone on the bedside table, inches from Truman's head, begins to ring.  Truman doesn't flinch. \nINT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nSYLVIA walks up from the seashore where she has been taking a late night swim.  Hearing the telephone ringing; she rushes to pick it up.  However, after lifting the receiver, the phone continues to ring. \nThe sound is coming from her television, left on in the bureau. On the screen, TRUMAN sleeps, seemingly undisturbed by the call. Sylvia, drying herself, watches with fascination. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT. \nCHRISTOF and the CREW are now highly agitated. \nCHRISTOF (a trace of panic) He didn't drink tonight?  No pills? \nEvery question receives a shake of the Assistant's head in reply. \nCHRISTOF Hang up! \nChloe promptly cuts the connection and Truman's phone ceases to ring. \nCHRISTOF Get Marlon over there. \nCHLOE Under what pretext? \nCHRISTOF (letting his anxiety show) Any fucking pretext! \n", "test3_true": "EXT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nMARLON's car squeals to a halt outside Truman's house. Hurriedly dressed in jeans and coat over a bare chest, he dashes barefoot to the front door.  He tries the doorhandle, pounds on the door and rings the doorbell simultaneously, shouting Truman's name all the while. \nMARLON Tru!..Tru!.. \nFrustrated, Marlon runs to the bedroom and thumps on the window. He can see the shape of Truman lying on the bed but his shouts fail to rouse him.  Marlon picks up one of Meryl's carefully nurtured flower pots from beneath the bedroom window. \nMARLON (shouting a warning) I'm comin' in, Tru! \nMarlon hurls the flower pot through the window sending a shower of glass over Truman's bed.  Still he doesn't move.  Marlon reaches his hand through the shards of glass clinging to the window frame and unlatches the window. \nNT. TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT. \nMARLON clanbers headfirst through the opened window and lands in an awkward heap on the floor beside TRUMAN's bed. \nHe pushes away the clutter in the bedroom and finally stands at his co-star's bedside.  There is a hissing sound. Marlon gingerly lifts the bedcover.  Beneath the bedding is a life-size inflatable female doll. \nThe doll has been punctured by the glass and is slowly deflating.  Lying beside the doll's chest is Truman's portable tape recorder.  Marlon picks up the recorder and places it next to his ear.  The cassette plays the sound of Truman breathing. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT. \nCHRISTOF, wide-eyed, stares at the image on the On-Air monitor of MARLON and his bizarre companion.  Marlon is frozen, staring into camera. \nCHRISTOF (quiet but firm) Cut transmission. \nSimeon hesitates, unsure if has heard correctly.  He looks to Christof for confirmation, his finger poised over an \"EMERGENCY\" button. \nCHRISTOF (enraged) I said, \"Cut\"! \nChristof lunges forward and presses the button himself. \nINT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nSYLVIA watches agog as the scene in Truman's bedroom on her television screen is replaced by the \"TRUMAN\" logo and the message, \"TECHNICAL FAULT.  PLEASE STAND BY.\" \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM NIGHT. \nCHRISTOF has taken his place at the control panel.  On the bank of monitors in front of the mixing desk, the OPERATORS systematically search through the numerous set-ups in Truman's home and neighborhood.  Occasionally MARLON or an EXTRA appear in frame as they fan out and begin a man-hunt. \nWhile the on-Air monitor continues to play its test-card, Christof and Simeon concentrate on another isolated monitor playing in fast-rewind, time code in the bottom right corner. It is a recording of the night's transmission.  Simeon stops on the last on-camera appearance by TRUMAN. \nThey watch Truman, on-screen, switch off his bedroom light and climb into bed fully clothed, immediately pulling the covers over his head.  As the light is switched off, the recording camera automatically switches to night vision.  Simeon continues to play at normal speed, now and then scrolling forward in fast- forward mode.  Christof suddenly points to the screen. \nCHRISTOF There.  Freeze...Zoom into the chair... \nSimeon types the appropriate command. \nCHRISTOF Enhance. \nOn the blown-up screen, between a cardboard box and a chair leg, it is barely possible to make out Truman's hand as he crawls commando-style from his bedroom, his inflatable replacement already positioned in the bed. \nCHRISTOF (referring to the debris) He wasn't making a mess.  He was engineering a blind spot. \nCHLOE How does he know where the cameras are? \nCHRI STOF I don't know. (noting the time-code on the monitor, staring into the back of Simeon's head) All I know is we've been filming a blow-up doll for the last three hours. \nSimeon feels the hostility. \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY. \nThe systematic search of the monitors continues.  They now reveal that dawn has broken on the set. \nSIMEON (hanging up the phone) We've declared a curfew.  Only the extras required for the search are on the set. Everyone else is at first positions. \nCHRISTOF All prop cars accounted for? \nSIMEON He has to be on foot.  He has the world's most recognizable face.  He can't disappear. \nAll heads turn to CHLOE as she enters the grand control room with a status report. \nCHLOE The sponsors are threatening to pull the plug if we don't make a statement within the next hour.  The media is in a feeding frenzy.  The phone lines are jammed.  Every network has a pirated shot of Harlon and the dummy. \n", "test3_id": 2348}

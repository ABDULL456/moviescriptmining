Roger stares up at the grim faced Black. 
Roger:	I COULD RUN RIGHT TONIGHT. 
The black man just stares levelly into Roger's eyes. 
Roger:	FRIEND OF MINE GOT A HELICOPTER. HE DOES TRAFFIC FOR J.A.S. GOT A HELICOPTER AND HE'S RUNNIN' OUT WITH IT. AS'T ME T'COME. 
The Black man smiles. 
Roger:	YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT TO RUN? 
The Black man shrugs again, then he stands and walks down the stairs. HE turns past Roger on the landing and continues down into the lingering gas mist. Roger follows. 
62	 A few landings down...a noise. The two Troopers freeze. The stairwell is dark. The noise grows louder. The Troopers ready their weapons. 
The sounds are little scraping thumps, like the weary foot falls of someone...something...trying to negotiate the stairs...There is the low, wheezing sound of laboured breath. 
The men stare at the landing below. The Black man steps forward slightly, trying not to make a sound. 
Suddenly, a figure pops out of the darkness. It falls against the wall below. Both Troopers raise their guns. The figure pulls away from the wall. In the mist, it's shape is ghostly... robed...in black...is sees the Troopers... 
Figure:	 SENORES... PLEASE TO LET ME PASS... 
The voice weakens into a low wheezing cough. The figure slumps and sits on the steps, clinging to the railing. It is an old Priest, obviously from a local Puerto Rican Parish. 
Roger stoops next to the old man, who is struggling to keep his breath. He is weary. He seems to be near death. He clutches at his chest. 
Roger tries to support him. 
Roger:	LET'S GET HIM TO THE MEDICS... 
Priest:	 NO...NO...NO...PLEASE. JUST...LET ME PASS...MY SISTER...I GO UP TO SEVEN FLOOR...TO FIND MY SISTER... 
Roger:	THEY'RE TAKIN' EVERYONE DOWN...THEY PROBABLY BROUGHT HER DOWN...COME ONE... 
Priest:	 MY SISTER...SHE IS DEAD...THEY TELL ME... THE DEAD THEY DO NOT BRING DOWN. 
Roger and the Black Trooper shoot glances at one another. 
Priest:	 JUST LET ME PASS. MARTINEZ IS DEAD. THE PEOPLE OF 107 WILL DO WHAT YOU WISH NOW. THESE SIMPLE PEOPLE... BUT STRONG...THEY HAVE LITTLE...BUT THEY DO NOT GIVE IT UP EASILY. AND THEY GIVE UP THEIR DEAD...TO NO ONE! 
The Priest goes into a coughing fit. The Troopers look on. Roger wants to help in some way. 
Priest:	 MANY HAVE DIED ON THESE STREETS IN THE LAST WEEKS...IN THE BASEMENT OF THIS BUILDING YOU FIND THEM... 
The Troopers are shocked. The Priest struggles to his feet. 
Priest:	 I HAVE GIVEN THEM THE LAST RITES. NOW...YOU DO WHAT YOU WILL... 
The old man starts up the stairs. Roger moves to help him, but the big Black man stops him. The Priest weaves up through the gas mist, coughing. 
Priest:	 YOU ARE STRONGER THAN US...BUT SOON, I THINK...THEY BE STRONGER THAN YOU... 
The old man's voice trails off up the stairwell as he disappears in the cloud... 
Priest:	 WHEN THE DEAD WALK, SENORES...WE MUST STOP THE KILLING...OR WE LOSE THE WAR... 
63	 In the basement of the large building, S.W.A.T. troopers pry at the boards which are nailed over the entrance to the storage area. 
The rest of the riot troops stand at the ready, weapons raised...high powered rifles...flame throwers... 
The nails creak loudly as they are pulled free. The men are silent, not knowing what to expect. 
There are three boards left...then two... 
With a great, tearing sound, the door flies open before the men remove the last boards. The boards fly and the door almost rips off its hinges. Like flood waters, a small army of Zombies pushes into the hall. 
They are wide eyed and terrifying. In life, they were mostly Blacks and Puerto Ricans from the neighbouring buildings. They are all ages, from the very old to the very young. 
The riot troops are stunned. They cannot react quickly enough, and the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is impossible to shoot accurately, or without the bullets injuring other troopers. 
The men fight back, wrestling and trying to back away. In the front line, Zombies bite at the flesh of the humans. Teeth tear into arms and hands. Some men are trampled in the crush. 
Commander:   BACK OFF...BACK OFF...SPREAD OUT... 
The rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule, and as the mass of struggling bodies spreads out, shots begin to fire. Some Troopers, at close quarters, are able to fire off accurate rounds with their hand guns. Others fall and are lunged at by clutching ghouls. 
Roger and the Black Trooper are in the middle of the battle. They fight off several of the creatures. The battle spreads into little skirmishes through the dark hallways. The highly organised Troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless onslaught. 
64	 As the main action moves away from the entrance to the storage area, several Troopers move into the room. 
The walls are dank and grey. There is a dripping sound. All around lie remnants of human civilisation. Baby buggies and bicycles chained to pipes which ring the area. Large trunks and cartons of every size and shape; old beds and other furniture.

FLASH CUTS: 
WILSON. Shaving in the mirror at his L.A. motel. He stops. 
WILSON. In the car leaving Valentine's house. Fingering the picture of Jenny. 
WILSON I would have preferred staying home, me. 
LADY You're a reluctant traveller, then. 
Wilson nods. 
FLASH CUTS: 
WILSON. In the car with Elaine and Ed, driving back from Big Sur. Everyone in their own world. 
WILSON. At Ed's house. Saying goodbye. 
WILSON AND ED. Shake hands. 
ED. Watching him get into Elaine's car. 
WILSON Got called out to L.A., unexpected like, to do a job of work. 
FLASH CUTS: 
WILSON. At the airport, staring at Elaine. 
ELAINE. Staring back. 
WILSON AND ELAINE. She embraces him. 
ELAINE. She watches him leave. 
WILSON. Disappearing into the terminal. 
LADY You'll be looking forward to getting back, then. 
WILSON Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return. 
LADY No rest for the wicked. 
Wilson nods, exhales. 
FLASH CUT: 
WILSON. In the cab on the way to Ed's, at the beginning of the film. Watching the lights go by. 
WILSON Been away a lot. 
LADY Where else? 
Longer beat.  He actually turns to look at her now.  Takes her in, then looks forward again. 
WILSON Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years. 
LADY Nine years? (laughs) Is that legal? 
WILSON Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean. 
LADY But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time. 
WILSON I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States. 
LADY (reacting slightly to his "colorful" language) Sounds like you need a rest. 
WILSON Could do, yeah. 
Another beat. 
WILSON But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking. 
LADY The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders. 
WILSON Yeah. 
And he turns away, to the window.  Looks at the blue sky. Sips his drink.  Then, hard: 
WILSON Them next. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
THE END.

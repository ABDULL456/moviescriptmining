CARLOS (in Spanish) Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy? 
SETH Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place? 
CARLOS I don't know, one place's as good as another. 
SETH Have you ever been there before? 
CARLOS No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning. 
SETH Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead. 
Carlos stands up again. 
CARLOS I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos? 
SETH Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are. 
Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing themselves again. 
CARLOS Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you? 
SETH You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start. 
CARLOS Twenty-eight. 
SETH Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty. 
They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison. 
SETH AND CARLOS (in Spanish) Twenty-five. 
Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over to a red 1990 Porsche 911. 
CARLOS You like the car? 
SETH I said new, this is an '90. 
CARLOS It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new. 
SETH So do I just follow you? 
CARLOS Yeah, follow us. 
SETH So let's do it. 
CARLOS (to Danny and Manny) Vamanos! 
Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes. 
Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate. 
Kate stands alone. 
The whole desert seems between them. 
So much to say ... but no words. 
SETH I'm sorry. 
KATE Me too. 
Long pause. 
SETH See ya. 
KATE Later. 
Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate says behind him: 
KATE (O.S.) Seth.

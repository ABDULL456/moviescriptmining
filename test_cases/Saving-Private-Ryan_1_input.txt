UPHAM You think he really believed it? 
WADE Who knows?  It worked. 
REIBEN Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear. 
WADE Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes. 
REIBEN You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this. 
WADE Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining. 
Upham, feeling bold and a bit naughty, decides to give it a shot. 
UPHAM Well, as a matter of fact, I was just thinking... 
The men roll their eyes, expecting the worst. 
UPHAM (continuing) That I'm so fucking tired of this goddamned walking, I'd pay a thousand dollars to see that bastard Ryan crawl on his belly over an acre of broken glass to hear my great-aunt Martha fart through a field-phone. 
The men are stunned. 
REIBEN Jesus Christ, he's a natural! 
MILLER Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat? 
Upham wiggles with pride.  Upham Positive, sir, I'm certain I'd remember. 
Miller eyes Upham respectfully and nods to the men. 
MILLER He's good. 
They walk on. 
JACKSON Cap'n, my feet are most uncomfortable. 
Miller smiles, situation normal. 
EXT. ST. MERE - LATE AFTERNOON 
A small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active battlefield.  HEAVY SMALL ARMS FIRE.  GRENADE AND MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  MEDIUM ARTILLERY BEYOND.  American soldiers crouch in doorways, FIRING at well-placed Germans. 
Some French civilians dash across a street.  A man and a couple of women, one carrying a child.  They make it across and disappear into the remains of a building. 
Miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a corner.  Sarge and the other men follow in leap-frog, spread out down the block behind him. 
Miller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental picture of a GATHERING OF G.I.'s crouching in the cover of an alley across the street and down the block.  They are CAPTAIN HAMILL, about Miller's age, and HIS MEN. 
As Miller ducks back behind the corner, A GERMAN BULLET SMASHES into the bricks where his head was an instant before. 
Miller motions Jackson across first. 
MILLER Stay low. 
Jackson gathers himself, takes off.  GERMAN BULLETS BLAST, kicking up the cobblestone behind him.  Jackson zig-zags and makes it to the cover of the far side. 
JACKSON Dang!  That was close! 
Miller nods to Upham. 
MILLER Your turn. 
Upham, scared shitless, doesn't move.  Miller speaks to him very gently. 
MILLER Zig-zag, change your pace a couple times, you'll be alright. 
Upham's frozen.  He can barely breathe.  Miller sighs. 
MILLER Okay, I'm going to draw fire for you. (sternly) But if I do, you goddamned well better go. 
Upham nods.  Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath. 
CLOSE SHOT:  MILLER'S HAND quivers. 
MILLER Looks to Upham 
MILLER Ready? 
Upham nods, still terrified. 
MILLER STEPS INTO THE OPEN 
Stands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers.

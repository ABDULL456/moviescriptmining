BRAIN Yeah, yeah, but how?  You gotta land the glider and take off. (he gestures at the map) You can't do it in Central Park, there's too many trees.  Port Authority's too low to the ground.  Unless it was some... (he gets it... they don't call him "Brain" for nothing) Someplace high up.  World Trade Center.  That's it.  There we go.  The World Trade Center.  And it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier for me to take off than it was for him to land. 
INT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON Hauk reads the note left in the briefcase. 
HAUK "Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City in exchange for President. 69th Street Bridge tomorrow, 12 Noon.  No bullshit or he's dead." 
VICE PRESIDENT Where's the tape? 
HAUK Not here. 
He reaches inside and removes a pair of goggles. 
REHME They're Plissken's. 
Yeah, they were on the table.  He never did use them, though, and only half of them is necessary in his case anyway. 
VICE PRESIDENT So much for your man, Hauk? 
Hauk hesitates.  This is the last thing he wants. 
HAUK Warm up the choppers.  We're moving in. 
EXT. BASE -- SUNSET Helicopters prepare for takeoff. 
INT. BASE -- SUNSET Hauk sits at the microphone. 
HAUK Plissken? 
The master life clock reads 1:56:38. 37. 36, 
INT. ROOM -- SUNSET Snake slowly gets to his feet.  He's still groggy, but it's time for him to move. 
GUARD Come on, get up! 
Snake limps through a hallway and into a stadium. 
INT. STADIUM -- SUNSET Boos greet Snake as he walks in.  In the center of the room is a fighting ring.  Snake climbs in, not without effort.  A huge and extremely ugly man climbs into the ring, amid loud cheers.  Snake notices that the huge ugly dude is wearing his life clock.  In the balcony above is the Duke.  The Duke stands up and raises his arms, and everyone gets silent. 
DUKE They sent in their best man.  And when we roll down the 69th street bridge tomorrow on our way to freedom, we're gonna have their best man leading the way.  From the neck up.

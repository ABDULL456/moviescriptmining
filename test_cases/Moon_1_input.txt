The Girl remains in the mirror looking at Sam 1. A neutral expression, impassive. Sam 1 takes a deep breath, lowers the toilet paper from his nose. 
SAM 1 Who are you? 
No answer. 
SAM 1 (CONT'D) (shouting) Who are you! 
Sam 1 swings around to confront the Girl...but she's not there, she's vanished. Her reflection has vanished from the mirror also. 
CUT TO: 
99    INT. REC ROOM                                                99 
Sam 2 snaps on the TV with the remote, starts watching Laugh-In, turns, sees Sam 1 wander by in the corridor. Sam 2 considers calling out to him, opts against it, gives the TV his full attention. 
100   INT. MONITORING STATION                                    100 
Gerty is stationed at the Old Man collecting data. Sam 1 enters. 
GERTY Hello Sam. 
SAM 1 Hi Gerty. 
Sam 1 sits. A pause. Gerty turns from the monitor, faces of with an EXHAUSTED and DRAINED Sam 1. 
GERTY Sam, is everything okay? 
SAM 1 We had a fight. Me and the other guy, the other Sam. We had a fight, Gerty. He's a maniac. You know what he did? He flipped the entire model over. Do you know how much work I've put into that thing? 
GERTY 938 hours. 
SAM 1 938 hours, exactly. (then) Really? 938 hours. 
GERTY Approximately. 
SAM 1 (a beat) He scares me, Gerty. 
GERTY What is it about Sam that scares you? 
SAM 1 He flies off the handle. I see it now...I see what Tess was talking about. (a beat) I've never told you this, Gerty, but she left me. Tess left me. For six months. She moved back in with her parents. 
GERTY I know. 
SAM 1 Oh... (beat) It was the year before I came in here. She gave me a second chance. I promised her I'd change. 
GERTY You have changed, Sam. 
SAM 1 Yeah, I guess I have. 
A beat. 
SAM 1 (CONT'D) Gerty, since I've been up here I've sent Tess over a hundred video messages. Where did those messages go? Did they ever reach her? 
A pause. 
GERTY Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base. 
SAM 1 What about the messages she sent to me? 
A long pause. Finally Gerty repeats: 
GERTY Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base. 
SAM 1 Gerty, am I really a clone? 
GERTY Sam, when you first arrived at Selene, there was a small crash. You woke up in the infirmary. You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss. I kept you under observation and ran some tests. 
SAM 1 I remember. 
GERTY Sam, there was no crash. You were being awakened. (a beat) It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health. Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact-- 
SAM 1 And Tess?    Eve?

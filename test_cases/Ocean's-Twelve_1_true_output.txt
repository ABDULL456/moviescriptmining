Tess can't bring herself to tell Danny the truth, that it was entirely her fault. 
TESS Danny, don't keep thinking about it. 
DANNY (TELEPHONE V.O.) I did something wrong. He should never have found us. 
(CONTINUED) 
40   CONTINUED:                                                   40 
TESS I'll call you tomorrow. I love you. 
DANNY I love you. 
41   INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT                          41 
Danny hangs up the phone and site. 
CUT TO: 
42   INT. HOTEL -- NIGHT                                          42 
In other rooms, the guys get themselves settled in. Each takes a step toward personalizing their suite. 
43   EXT. AMSTERDAM COFFEE HOUSE -- DAY                           43 
Danny and Rusty lead an obviously eager Linus towards a coffee house. 
RUSTY She'll try and use her looks to distract you. Don't let her. 
DANNY Be polite, but firm. 
LINUS Right. 
RUSTY Don't get soft on us. Don't make too many concessions. 
LINUS I won't. 
Danny and Rusty nod. Okay. 
44   INT. COFFEE HOUSE -- CLOSE ON EVELYN.                        44 
Who is obviously a MAN IN DRAG. 
Linus looks to Danny and Rusty but they give him nothing. 
(CONTINUED) 
44   CONTINUED:                                                    44 
EVELYN The onset of summer is like a woman who owns too many shoes. 
She/He looks to Linus, who looks to Danny and Rusty. 
DANNY (bailing Linus out) If animals were capable of flattery, the World Bank would be open until 8pm. 
EVELYN When I was four years old, I saw my mother kill a spider with a tea cozy. 
Again, the Evelyn looks to Linus, who has nothing to say. 
RUSTY A doctor who specializes in skin diseases will dream that he has fallen asleep in front of the television. Later he will wake up in front of the television but not remember his dream. 
Evelyn nods and looks to Linus, as do Danny and Rusty. He furrows his brow, then speaks: 
LINUS O let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dreams. I am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I have been. 
Danny and Rusty stare at Linus like he's nuts, like he's just cracked. Evelyn's entire expression changes. 
EVELYN Your young friend has a great deal to learn about respect. 
She/He puts his/her drink down and walks to another part of the establishment. 
DANNY Linus...why don't you wait outside. 
Rusty and Danny follow Evelyn and quietly console him/her. 
45   EXT. COFFEE HOUSE -- AFTERWARD -- DAY                       45 
Linus cools his heels.   Danny and Rusty emerge from inside. 
DANNY Is that your idea of making a contribution? 
RUSTY Her terms were scandalous. And we were lucky to get them after what you said. 
DANNY The deal was this close to being blown. 
LINUS "Deal?"   What "deal?" 
Danny and Rusty just look at him. 
LINUS (cont'd) I know what you guys are doing. 
Danny and Rusty exhange looks. What? 
LINUS (cont'd) Look. That...person had too many cupcakes. 
They just keep staring at him. 
LINUS (cont'd) I was playing along. 
RUSTY "Playing along!"

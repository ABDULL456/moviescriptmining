GENE jerks a thumb at MR. SMITH and is gone. MR. SMITH starts to follow him. The BARTENDER is right with him. 
BARTENDER Hey, Sir, don't make me call a cop. 
MR. SMITH slaps some money on the bar and leaves. 
T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1 Left field bleachers heard from. 
T.V. REPORTER Laughs. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:13PM 
MR. SMITH scans the lobby trying to spot Gene. OFFICER TRUST comes up behind him. 
OFFICER TRUST Where is he? Did you lose him? 
MR. SMITH Shut up. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOP ARCADE - DAY - 1:13PM 
Elsewhere, GENE circles around the lobby. There seem to be clocks everywhere. 
A. set of four clocks over the registration desk with the time for Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Paris. 
The souvenir shop has a dozen clocks on display, with the logos of various LA sports teams. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - RESTAURANT AREA - DAY - 1:14PM 
The restaurant, the travel agency, the newsstand, all have clocks. 
Everywhere he turns. GENE has to look at his watch. 
1:15! GENE's watch and all the clocks tick over at once. GENE winces as if he could hear all those minute hands tick over one number in a thunderous chorus. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 1:16PM 
He's near the Men's Room. HUEY's stand has a sign on the chair - "Gone to Lunch" and there is a clock face with moveable hands. "We'll be back at 1:30." 
GENE (sotto voice) Let's all hope so. 
And he enters the Men's Room. 
Across the lobby MR. SMITH spots him, heads that way. 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM 
GENE enters to find HUEY and GUSTINO the Bellboy. HUEY runs to the door, keeping a lookout. 
HUEY Quick, off with the shoes and pants. Trade with Gustino. The big guy's coming. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:16PM 
MR. SMITH marching towards the Men's Room. 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM 
HUEY turns to see GENE and GUSTINO just looking at each other, uncomfortable, to say the least. 
HUEY C'mon, ladies. No time to be shy. 
GENE kicks off his shoes, shucks his pants. He trades his pants and jacket with GUSTINO, who has done the same. GUSTINO's pants are too big for GENE. His pants are too small for GUSTINO. 
GUSTINO goes into a stall and closes the door. 
HUEY comes back from the door. 
HUEY Gustino! Drop 'em! 
GUSTINO has taken a seat inside the stall, but with GENE's pants still up. He drops them. 
HUEY And cover up them socks. Man, who dresses you? 
HUEY leads GENE to another door. "Service Personnel Only". He taps on it. It is opened by a Latino JANITOR. HUEY and GENE slip through the door, shut it. The JANITOR begins mopping the floor as MR. SMITH comes in. 
His eyes come to rest on the stall. All he sees are GENE's shoes and GENE's pants crumpled around the ankles. 
MR. SMITH smirks and leaves.

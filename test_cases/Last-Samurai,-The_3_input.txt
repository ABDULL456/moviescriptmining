Panic and chaos-- 
ALGREN Hold the line! 
Too late-- the samurai are on them-- 
They attack with an intensity few have ever seen -- many of the Japanese soldiers try to escape, turning and running in blind panic -- they are butchered-- run through by the ashigaru, cut inhalf by the naginata. 
Those soldiers who laboriousl y try to reload their rifles are quickly mowed down by ferocious clouds of samurai arrows, fired by mounted Samurai. 
ALGREN Sound fall back! Sound fall back! 
A bugler sounds the order. The Army begins to retreat. 
But suddenly they are attacked from behind as well! Arrows shoot from the fog and more mounted samurai appear. 
They are surrounded. 
Algren, Gant, and the Japanese Offi cers call out orders but all discipline soon breaks down -- it is every man for himself-- 
The battle swirls ever ywhere around us. Fleeing soldiers are run through by lances, run down and trampled by horses. 
Each samurai wears individual, vibrantly col ored armor. Various battle flags sweep through the fog. 
Gant uses his two cavalry revolvers -- firing constantly -- finally out of ammo he drops from his horse in the cavalry st yle and pulls a Winchester repeating rifle, crouching and quickly firing-- 
Algren uses his revol ver first -- firing as he turns on his horse -- when the revol ver is empty he pulls his cavalry saber. He manages to parry the lethal blows as the Samurai hurtle past -- 
But one Samurai, his armor all in black, comes at him on a collision course and SLAMS INTO HIM, sending both horse and rider to the ground. 
Algren scrambles to his feet, his saber nowhere to be found as another rider heads toward him carrying a lance. 
Algren manages to grab it and throw the rider to the ground, wrestling the lance from his grip and running him through. 
In the midst of the battle we notice a peculiar thing. One samurai is just sitting on his horse. Watching Algren. This samurai wears a BLACK MASK. 
The MASKED SAMUARI watches Algren fight. 
Algren now wields the lance to battle the horsemen as they sweep past. He spears one and then unseats another. When a third samurai cuts his lance in half, Algren uses the remaining half as a club to take him down. 
The Masked Samurai continues to watch Algren. Algren's tenacity is amazing. He continues to fight with heroic passion, refusing to give an inch, long after Those around him have fled. 
Then a blaze of bright yellow ­ a samurai in yellow armor galloping past, firing arrows steadily from horseback. His control and speed are astounding. 
We will come to know him as YORITOMO, a handsome young samurai. 
Yoritomo fires arrow upon arrow ­ the speed is breathtaking ­ Two arrows slam into Gant, knocking him to the ground. 
The battle, meanwhile, has become a rout. Those Imperial soldiers who fight are easily cut down. Those who flee are run down like prey. 
Left alone, Algren finds himself confronted by ashigaru ­ samurai foot soldiers carrying pikes. He turns to discover his retreat cut off by other 
samurai wielding katana ­ the lethal long sword. 
But rather than give any quarter, Algren launches an attack. He kills one samurai before he is RUN THROUGH, at the shoulder, by a lance. 
In agony, Algren SNAPS OFF the hilt of the lance, leaving its tip buried deep in his chest, and fights on. 
He manages to parry a blow ­ which SLICES into his side. The next blow takes off a piece of his scalp. Blood fl ows down his faces and into his eyes. 
Algren is now surrounded by ten samurai. A man's heroic stand against certain death is of great interest to them. As they begin to close in, Algren whirls the lance around, a tattered battle-flag with TIGER INSIGNIA still dangling from the end. 
The MASKED SAMURAI removes his mask. It is the JAPANESE MAN, whose dream of the tiger we glimpsed at the beginning of the story. His eyes wide in surprise, he watches his dream come to life--the blue tiger holding the dogs at bay. 
In SLOW MOTION Algren whirls the lance, as one samurai, wearing BLOOD-RED ARMOR, advances. With a murderous smile, he draws his katana. Algren seems spent ­ he drops to one knee, swaying, on the brink of losing consciousness. But as the RED SAMURAI, lets out a battle cry and propels himself forward for the death blow - Algren suddenly LEAPS UP and propels the jagged wooden end of the broken lance into the unprotected throat of his attacker. 
As the samurai falls, the rest of his comrades close in to cut Algren off. 
A harsh COMMAND stops them in their tracks. 
The Masked Samurai leaps from his horse. Everyone steps aside deferentially so that be might pass by without being jostled.                    . 
He looks down at Algren, then removes his battle helmet. 
And we meet _MORI KATSUMOTO, the leader of the samurai. He it an imposing man of about Algren's years. 
Sensing that he is about to be killed, Algren pulls himself t o his knees, and SWINGS his saber at Katsumoto. With blinding speed, Katsumoto pulls his katana from its scabbard. 
Algren's saber is SNAPPED CLEANLY IN TWO. 
Katsumoto looks down at Algren. 
Then Gant appears behind Katsumoto -- limping toward him, cocking his rifle, urgently trying to save Algren-- 
Ujio, (the Samurai we saw earlier on the streets of Tokyo) leaps to protect his Lord. His sword flashes-- 
Gant is eviscerated. Algren watches in horror. 
A dreadful beat as Gant stands, pathetically trying to hold his guts in. Then he sinks to his knees. 
Katsumoto turns, leaps back onto his horse and trots off. 
Algren finally wrenches himself from under his horse. He crawls to Gant, blood pouring from his own injured back and shoulder. 
Gant is dead. 
Algren looks up to see the battle is lost. The Japanese soldiers have fled. Or are surrendering, injured or dead. 
And he sees one other thing. General Yoshitaka is still on his horse, head down. He has not pulled his sword. He has not been hurt. 
Katsumoto rides to Yoshitaka. A few serious words are exchanged. Katsumoto bows his bead in respect, seems to agree to something. 
Both men climb from their horses. General Yoshitaka pulls out a small b1ade and hands it to Katsumoto, who holds it out firmly.

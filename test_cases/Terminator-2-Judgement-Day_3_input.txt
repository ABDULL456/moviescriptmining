SARAH Now, Enrique. (turns to Terminator and John) You two are on weapons detail. 
CUT TO: 
A103    EXT. COMPOUND/BEHIND THE TRAILERS 
There is an aging and rusted Caterpillar sitting behind one of the trailers.  John expertly backs it toward Terminator who is holding one end of a piece of heavy chain which disappears into the sand. 
JOHN Hook it on. 
Terminator hooks the chain onto the towhook on the back of the tractor.  John hits the throttle and the Cat churns its treads, pulling some massive load.  A six-by-eight foot sheet of steel plate moves slowly under six inches of sand. 
John drags it far enough to reveal... a rectangular hole in the ground.  Like the mouth of a tomb.  The kid drops down from the tractor and walks to the hole. 
JOHN One thing about my mom... she always plans ahead. 
A104    INT. WEAPONS CACHE 
From inside the "tomb".  Sunlight slashes down into a cinder-block room, less than six feet wide but over twenty long.  Sand spills down the steps.  The walls are lined with guns. 
John precedes Terminator into Sarah's weapons cache.  Rifles, pistols, rocket launchers, mortars, RPGs, radio gear.  At the far end, boxes containing ammo, grenades, etc. are stacked to the ceiling. Terminator gets real alert.  Scanning, wondering where to begin.  He picks up a MAC-10 machine pistol.  Racks the bolt. 
TERMINATOR Excellent. 
JOHN Yeah, I thought you'd like this place. 
A105    EXT. COMPOUND/NEARBY 
Sarah emerges from a trailer.  She has changed.  Boots, black fatigue pants, T-shirt.  Shades.  She looks hard. Salceda is nearby, packing food and other survival equipment with Yolanda.  He looks up as Sarah approaches, and slaps the side of a BIG FOUR-BY BRONCO next to him, 
SALCEDA This is the best truck, but the water pump is blown.  You got the time to change it out? 
SARAH Yeah.  I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border. (she pulls him away from Yolanda) Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.  You get out tonight, too, okay? 
SALCEDA Yeah, Saralita.  Sure. (he grins) Just drop by any time and totally fuck up my life. 
She slaps him on the shoulder. 
CUT TO: 
A106    INT. WEAPONS CACHE 
Terminator returns from carrying out several cases of ammo.  John is selecting rifles from a long rack. 
JOHN See, I grew up in places like this, so I just thought it was how people lived... riding around in helicopters.  Learning how to blow shit up. 
John grabs an AK-47 and racks the bolt with a practiced action. Inspects the receiver for wear.  Doesn't like what he sees.  Puts is back.  His movement are efficient.  Professional.  Uninterested. 
JOHN Then, when Mom got busted I got put in a regular school.  The other kids were, like, into Nintendo. 
Terminator has found a Vietnam-era "blooper" M-79 grenade launcher. A very crude but effective weapon.  He opens the breech and inspects the bore. 
JOHN Are you ever afraid? 
Terminator pauses for a second.  The thought never occurred to him. He searches him mind for the answer... 
TERMINATOR No. 
Terminator slings the M-79 and starts looking for the grenades. 
JOHN Not even of dying? 
TERMINATOR No. 
JOHN You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other? 
TERMINATOR No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter. 
John is idly spinning a Sig Saur 9mm pistol on his finger... backwards and forwards like Bat Masteron. 
JOHN Yeah.  I have to stay functional too. (sing-songy) "I'm too important". 
Terminator pulls back a canvas tarp, revealing a squat, heavy weapon with six barrels clustered in a blunt cylinder.  Chain-ammo is fed from a canister sitting next to it.  A G.E. MINI-GUN.  The most fearsome anti-personnel weapon of the Vietnam era. Terminator hefts it.  Looks at John as if to say "Can I?  Please?" 
JOHN It's definitely you.

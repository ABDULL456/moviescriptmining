A two-story NEON ARROW points the way to this bungalow court -- Bright and awful ersatz western. LOG CABINS OF SIMULATED WOOD surround the TEEPEE-SHAPED OFFICE. The Addams' Duesenberg is parked in front of the furthest cabin. The asphalt has been ripped up in big chunks and Lurch's tree is parked next to the Addams' new home.

C.U. DRESSING TABLE MIRROR 
Morticia leans into frame. With an icepick and a hammer, she deftly makes a large spidery CRACK in the round mirror. Sighing deeply, she stands back to admire her handiwork. Granny joins her. 
GRANNY 
I like it. Her mother pats her consolingly. 
MORTICIA 
Just as long as we're together, n'est pas, mon cher? As she turns to Gomez, we see the interior of the bungalow -- all ersatz cowboy and Indian mixed with chrome-plated plastic and orange shag carpet. 
GOMEZ 
sits slumped in a   chair made from wagon wheel and nauga- hyde. It's as if    all of his insane, vibrant energy has been leeched from   him. He's a broken man. He looks back at her as if he's   never heard French. 
GOMEZ 
Huh? Wednesday tends to him.    She and her mother exchange a worried look. 
PUGSLEY 
comes from the bathroom, nibbling a wrapped bar of motel soap. 
PUGSLEY 
This place isn't so bad. They even put candy in the bathroom. 
MORTICIA 
That's the soap, dear.

PUGSLEY 
Oh. He takes another greedy bite. Wednesday pats her father's arm.

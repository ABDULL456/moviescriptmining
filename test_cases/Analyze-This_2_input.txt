MICHAEL Okay, okay. How's that guy who dreams about shitting trout? 
BEN (entering, putting on his tux shirt) Fine. He moved up to striped bass. Put on your cummerbund. Boy, have you grown. Did your mother move next door to a nuclear power plant? 
MICHAEL (struggling with the cummerbund) Why do we have to wear rented clothes to Grandpa's party? This blows. 
BEN (helping him) We have to dress up because Grandpa can't have a good time unless everyone else is extremely uncomfortable. (looks at Michael and makes a quick decision) Forget the tux. Regular clothes. 
Ben exits, pulling off the tux shirt. 
MICHAEL (taking off his tux shirt) Are you ambivalent about Grandpa Isaac? 
BEN (O.S.) (from his room) Ambivalent? Where do you get that stuff? 
MICHAEL Mom. 
BEN (annoyed) She's not supposed to do that, you know. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
13   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 13 
BEN (CONT'D) Your mother and I, when we got divorced, we agreed we wouldn't put you in the middle, or use you as a go-between to talk about each other. So just do me a favor and tell your mother to shut her big mouth. (comes back into Michael's room) Did she say anything about me getting married again? I think she could be feeling a little anger about it. 
MICHAEL Oh, yeah. She really cares. She says you're intimidated by women your own age, and that's why you go for these young babes. 
BEN (fuming) Okay. Listen, for two seconds, pretend I'm not your father. I'm just some guy, okay? 
MICHAEL You gonna vent? 
BEN Yeah. (venting) I hate her! I really hate her! (a beat, then brightly) Okay. Dad again. Let's go. 
CUT TO: 
14   EXT. WAREHOUSE - SAME TIME                                        14 
Paul Vitti gets out of his car and walks to the warehouse with his most trusted soldier, Jelly, a hulking bruiser, and his sidekick JIMMY, a tightly-wound ferret with chips on both shoulders. 
VITTI So what did you find out? 
(CONTINUED) 
14    CONTINUED:                                                       14 
JELLY (as they walk) The word is Primo Sindone must have ordered it, but, uh -- 
He hesitates. 
VITTI What? 
Jelly looks at Jimmy. 
VITTI What? 
JELLY (reluctantly) A lot of people think you set him up. 
VITTI Why the fuck would I want to kill Dominic? He was like a father to me. 
JELLY So you could be the big boss. Everybody figures you're lookin' to wipe out the competition before the big meeting. 
VITTI Oh, is that what they figure? 
JELLY It's alright with me if you did -- 
VITTI I didn't kill him! I told you that! Don't you hear? 
CUT TO: 
14A   INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION                               14A 
They enter a room where other Vitti family soldiers, EDDIE COKES, TUNA, and JOHNNY BIGS are waiting. In the middle of the room, a young rat named NICKY SHIVERS is tied to a chair under a strong overhead light. When he speaks, we get a hint of mental incompetence. 
(CONTINUED) 
14A   CONTINUED:                                                      14A 
NICKY Please, Mr. Vitti, I told 'em I don't know anything but they don't believe me 'cause that one time I said Little Joe hit Dukey and it turned out he didn't but I didn't know because -- 
JIMMY (smacks him) Shut the fuck up! 
Nicky goes suddenly quiet. He watches in terror as Jimmy steps aside and Vitti moves close holding a short length of lead pipe. 
VITTI Nicky, you know me, right? 
NICKY Yeah.   You're Mr. Vitti. 
VITTI And you know what I'm gonna do to you if you lie to me, right? 
NICKY Uh, you're gonna crack me on the head with that pipe? 
JIMMY (slaps him) It's a rhetorical question, you fuckin' idiot. 
VITTI I'm only gonna ask you this one time. Who killed Dominic Manetta? 
NICKY I don't know. 
VITTI (roars) Don't fuckin' lie to me! 
NICKY (in tears) Honest to God, I don't know! 
VITTI You little rat bastard...

They look at each other and laugh, them fall back into the embrace. They both get faraway looks in their eyes. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S GARAGE - NIGHT 
The clock reads 3:00 AM. Craig, in his pajamas, is working the Craig and Maxine puppets. They make love on the bare puppet stage. Craig seems possessed. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MAXINE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The phone rings. Maxine sleepily picks it up. 
MAXINE Yes? 
LOTTE (O.S.) I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over? 
MAXINE When? 
LOTTE (O.S.) Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly. 
Maxine checks her alarm clock. The time is 3:11 AM. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S CAR - NIGHT 
Lotte drives. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MAXINE'S APARTMENT - A BIT LATER 
The doorbell rings. Maxine, in a sheer black nightgown, answers it. John Malkovich stands there. 
MAXINE Thanks so much for coming over. 
MALKOVICH Oh, I'm really glad you called. 
Maxine gestures for him to enter. As Malkovich passes by her, she checks the wall clock. The time is 3:50. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Lotte sits on the floor in the dark. She leans, out of breath, against the wall next to the portal and checks her watch. The time is 4:10. She pulls open the door. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MAXINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Maxine and Malkovich sit a bit awkwardly next to each other on the couch. 
MAXINE So, do you enjoy being an actor? 
MALKOVICH Oh sure. It's very rewarding... 
The digital clock on the VCR clicks over to 4:11 AM. Maxine's look softens, and she kisses Malkovich hard on the lips. He seems surprised, but quickly warms to it. We shift top Malkovich's POV as Maxine begins to unbutton Malkovich's shirt. 
LOTTE (V.O.) Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart. 
MAXINE I love you, Lotte. 
LOTTE (V.O.) Maxine... 
MALKOVICH (stopping) I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"? 
MAXINE Do you mind? 
MALKOVICH (thinking) No, I guess not. I'm an actor. 
They get back to it. 
MAXINE Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte. 
MALKOVICH (thinks he's playing along) Yes, Maxine, yes. 
LOTTE (V.O.) This is too good to be true.

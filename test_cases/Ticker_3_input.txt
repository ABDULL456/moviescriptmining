Deeper, deeper. 
AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN 
The SWAT Van and a unit arrive, Winters and Benson jump out, the SWAT Team is about to follow- 
T.J. Get outta here, Swan's down, but they're chilling a device. 
Winters looks to the action at the U-Haul, sees Reilly and Glass busy at work. He nods at Benson. 
Finally Reilly' fingers touch a button object. We hear the SWAT Van and the unit retreat at the end of the alley. 
REILLY Something round, two wires ... 
GLASS That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait... 
REILLY What's wrong? 
GLASS Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe. 
REILLY Make up your mind, trigger. 
GLASS Ease your thumb over to the right - feel anything? 
Reilly eyes shift as his hidden fingers feel around... 
REILLY Yeah, another round thing. 
GLASS Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down. 
REILLY Which one's which? 
GLASS I don't know. 
REILLY What... ? 
GLASS When in doubt, pull the yellow wire. 
REILLY How the hell do you feel yellow? 
GLASS No excuses, just do it! 
10... Reilly glares at Glass. 
9... His face is dripping with sweat. 
8... His fingers shift back to the first cap. 
7... They close over it, ready to pull. 
6... But then they stop. 
5... Reilly frowns. 
4... Glass stabs him with a look. 
3... 2... Lightning-quick, Reilly' fingers fly back and yank the second cap out of its base. 
The counter stops.    0:01. 
Reilly and Glass and stare at it, holding their breath, hardly daring to believe it's true. They whoop and explode with relief. 
It's over... it's finally over.

CONTRACTOR/SCREEN Where have you been, Michael? 
He belches. 
He is communicating with his General Contractor. 
On the table is a collection of personal objects, much of it stuffed in pillow cases, taken from Electra's house. 
BAIN/SCREEN Tracking the mark. 
Bain fingers a pair of satin panties.  He smiles as he smells them. 
BAIN I'm on the scent. 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN You're too late. 
Bain slams his beer down. 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN I've learned from MicroCell, Rath fulfilled the contract. 
BAIN/SCREEN How? 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN He took out the mark and sold the disks back to MicroCell. 
Bain falls back in his chair, thinking.  He runs his hands through his sweaty hair. 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN Michael? 
BAIN No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it. 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when. 
BAIN What? 
BAIN/SCREEN How? 
There is no response. 
BAIN/SCREEN How in the fuck do you know that? 
A long beat. 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN Such language in front of a lady. 
BAIN I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you -- 
He hits the repeat key. 
BAIN (types) How in the fuck do you know that? 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN Do you want Rath or not? 
Bain stares at the screen, thinking.  Thinking hard. 
INT. LARGE CHAIN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Another computer screen, but we don't know that it is different. 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN It will take three days to arrange the transfer. 
ELECTRA Three days? 
We are in Electra and Rath's hotel room.  She is standing behind him, reading as he types. 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN Which account? 
ELECTRA Are you going to tell him? 
RATH It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine. 
ELECTRA You said you didn't trust it. 
RATH I don't. 
CONTRACTOR/SCREEN Which account? 
ELECTRA What kind of bank is going to allow us to withdraw ten million dollars the day it is transferred? 
RATH The kind preferred by drug smugglers, arms dealers and politicians. 
Rath types in an account number. 
RATH Do you have a passport? 
ELECTRA Several. 
RATH Good. 
ELECTRA Where is it? 
RATH Mexico. 
INT. AIRPLANE - DAY 
Rath and Electra are sitting in the first class section, which she is obviously enjoying, smiling and sipping champagne. 
ELECTRA God, I love first class.  I remember when I was a little girl, I would wonder what it was like up here.  I would always try to peek through the curtains. 
Rath says nothing, staring out the window. 
Electra shakes her head.

Luke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this. 
BEN	 (continuing his narrative) When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan. 
Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale. 
BEN	 (attempting to give solace with his words) The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate. 
Luke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his sister. 
LUKE But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her. 
BEN She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader! 
52   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET 
The vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. Overhead a dozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation. Fighters and battlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel Star Cruisers, the HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE. 
53   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM 
Hundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in the WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a holographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the nearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield. 
MON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a stern but beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several military leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a salmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the crowd until he finds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids. 
Han peers at Lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused. 
HAN Well, look at you, a general, huh? 
LANDO Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab. 
HAN	 (sarcastic) Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack. 
LANDO	 (smiling) I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. 
HAN Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? 
Mon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent. 
MON MOTHMA The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come. 
This causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of the Death Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the center of the room. 
MON MOTHMA The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. 
A volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns to Leia as Chewie barks his amazement. 
MON MOTHMA	 (cont) Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please. 
Admiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's force field and the Moon of Endor. 
ACKBAR You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. 
There's a concerned murmur. 
ACKBAR	 (cont) General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack 
Han turns to Lando with a look of respect. 
HAN Good luck. 
Lando nods his thanks. 
HAN You're gonna need it. 
ACKBAR General Madine.

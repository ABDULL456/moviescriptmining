GEORGE She probably meant me. So honest, the words confuse her. 
ELINOR Obviously, she doesn't see me as a threat. 
GEORGE Oh, sure she does. A straight smile... 
GEORGE (CONT'D) She just doesn't care. ...which silently fades. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) My job.     Is to care for her.

INT. OAK ROOM, PLAZA HOTEL, NEW YORK - NIGHT 
LONG ANGLE. Sophisticated watering hole. Crowded tonight. PAN to find George alone, waiting. A waiter leads Amelia to the table. George stands, smiling. But the smile is not returned. We CLOSE as they sit... 
GEORGE 
A hat's wrong? MELIA (clearly furious) What could be wrong? I had such a lovely afternoon with Elinor Smith. Oh. 
GEORGE he told you that I shut her out of the Derby. And that's true. 
AMELIA And when were you going to tell me? GEORGE (calm, straight) Never. I knew you'd go crazy. And I felt it needed to be done. She can scarcely believe this. 
AMELIA What? You think I wanted it done, but just let you do the dirty work? 
GEORGE I didn't say that. 
AMELIA Because I'm no angel. Business is competition and competition is rough, and I thank my stars that you're there making this life happen for me, but... 
GEORGE ou're making your life hap... 
AMELIA But this is different. It is. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) If women are going to stab women in the back, then women are going nowhere.

AMELIA You did it because you love me. That stops him. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) And when we're married, you mustn't ever... Now she stops.      Because his eyes are wide. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) What's the big shock? I thought you wanted to get married. Full beat. 
GEORGE did.   I do. 
AMELIA Well, then. His eyes moving over her face. 
GEORGE What about what you said? The day S            will come when you run away. he nods.    It will. 
AMELIA You'll be destroyed. And part of me will, too. And I think we both know it. And yet. 
AMELIA (CONT'D) Sometimes things happen that way. You're not better safe than sorry. Tears stand in his eyes.       He is so happy. 
AMELIA (a whisper) (CONT'D) Yes? GEORGE (a whisper) Hell yes.

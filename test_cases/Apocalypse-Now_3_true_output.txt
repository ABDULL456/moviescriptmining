SOLDIER  (O.S.) That's 27, sir. 
WILLARD Anyone got a card? 
Somebody hands Willard the deck. He takes a card and flips it out of the copter, never lifting his gaze from Kilgore. 
DISSOLVE TO : 
76  FULL SHOT - BATTLEFIELD - THE CAV, V.C. 
Americans run through the hooches FIRING and throwing GRENADES. Helicopters swoop overhead -- JETS ROAR by -- Uniformed N.V.A. regulars burst from a tunnel en- trance and charge the Americans. The SHOOTING is at point blank range -- automatic, as the V.C. are cut down. 
77  INT. COMMAND COPTER - KILGORE, WILLARD, LANCE, ETC. 
Kilgore leans out carefully, looking over the battle- field. He has the R.T. 
He leans back, deliberately avoiding Willard to speak to Lance. 
KILGORE The L.Z.'s cooling off fast -- we'll move in another company an' then we'll own it. (he laughs to himself) Charlie's point. 
He looks out toward the ocean. 
KILGORE (continuing) Good swell. 
LANCE What, sir? 
KILGORE I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it. 
Lance looks at Willard and then agrees. 
78  FULL SHOT - COPTER, SURF 
The pilots are used to this -- they bank sharply and swoop in on the lineup of waves, coming in  low over the point and streaking down a long, lined-up green wall as if surfing it. They tip up over and up at the last minute as the wave breaks. 
DISSOLVE TO : 
79  FULL SHOT - BEACH HUTS, SOLDIERS 
Americans line up blindfolded Viet Cong and N.V.A. regular troops outside a burning hut. GUNFIRE is DISTANT and sporadic -- an occasional MORTAR round SCREAMS in. A soldier yells in Vietnamese in a southern accent and the prisoners are marched away. Other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons emplacements -- 50 cal machine guns etc. Three Hueys ROAR in, fanning the smoke with their wind. The center one, the command ship, lands. JETS SCREAM over and the two gunships pull up at 200 feet. Another Huey zooms in low and lands behind the Colonel's. The doors open, guards jump out, check the situation, and out steps Kilgore and Lance. From the other copter are more guards, Kilgore's surfers and others of the P.B.R. crew. Willard follows. 
80  FULL SHOT - THE POINT 
They stride out across the debris-strewn beach. Kilgore stands majestically on the point watching the waves. A SHELL SCREAMS overhead. 
SOLDIER Incoming ! 
They all dive, except Kilgore. He is watching a big set -- the SHELL EXPLODES in the water about a hundred yards away, sending up a huge geyser of spray. Kilgore is unmoved. 
KILGORE Look at that. 
They look. 
LANCE This  L.Z. is still pretty hot, sir, maybe we oughta stand somewhere else. 
Kilgore pays him no mention. 
WILLARD I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel. 
KILGORE (without looking) It'll get here, soldier. 
He turns to Mike and Johnny who have their faces in the sand. 
KILGORE (continuing) Change. 
MIKE Wh -- what? 
KILGORE Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change. 
MIKE It's still pretty hairy, sir. 
KILGORE (bellowing) You want'a surf, soldier? 
He nods yes meakly. 
KILGORE (continuing) That's good, boy, because it's either surf or fight. 
They turn and hurry off -- Kilgore grabs an M-1 from one of the guards. They all think he's going to shoot the surfers or someone. They move back uneasy. 
KILGORE (continuing) I'm gonna cover for 'em -- that's all. 
He cocks thye weapon. Lance looks around uneasily. The Colonel walks over. 
KILGORE (continuing) You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance? 
LANCE I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in. 
A SHELL SCREAMS OVER -- they all hit the dirt except for Kilgore. It EXPLODES throwing sand through the air. Kilgore leans down yelling over the NOISE. 
KILGORE Doesn't happen for six hours. 
Lance looks up at him terrified, holding onto his helmet. 
KILGORE (continuing) The tide -- doesn't come in for six hours. 
DISSOLVE TO : 
81  FULL SHOT - SURF - MIKE AND JOHNNY

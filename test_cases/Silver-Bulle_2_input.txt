SOUND: A STEADY, LOW GROWLING, CLOSE. 
They all stop, scared. 
BILLY McCLAREN Where's it coming from? Other side? 
BOBBY No- it's behind us. I told you you couldn't trust- 
ASPINALL It isn't on either side. 
ANDY What are you- 
ASPINALL is looking around, his eyes widening with fear. 
ASPINALL It's under the fog. It's right in with us. 
The GROWLING STOPS. There's a beat of silence. Then: 
SOUND: SNARLING...AND A RIPPING CHOMP as dinner is served. 
SOUND: A SCREAM. 
EXT.  EDGAR ROUNDS, CLOSE 
He's the one screaming, and if he reminds us of O'BANION, that's okay, because ROUNDS has also been caught in a trap. He tries to run, stumbles, falls into the ground fog. He goes on screaming. We can see his back for a moment, and then it disappears. 
SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING AND SCREAMING. 
ROUNDS SHRIEKS. His hand and arm come up like the hand of a drowning man. Then it's gone. ROUNDS is gone. 
EXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE 
They stand there, chest deep in mist, a conspicuous hole in the ranks where EDGAR was. 
EXT.  BOBBY ROBERTSON, CU 
BOBBY (moaning) I can't move. Christ Jesus, I can't move! 
EXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE IN THE RAVINE, A NEW ANGLE 
The GROWLING STARTS AGAIN. THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP THE LINE. The mist swirls, hiding whatever's beneath. 
EXT.  ASPINALL, CU 
ASPINALL (low) I think we better start backing up, Andy. Real slow. Real- 
The LOW GROWL rises to a snarl. And from below the mist, snarling and bestial but understandable, mocking ASPINALL'S voice: 
WEREWOLF (voice) "Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!" 
SOUND: CHOMP! 
ASPINALL SHRIEKS and tries to run. He falls into the mist. There is another CHOMP. When he flounders up, half his face is gone. 
WEREWOLF (voice) "Real slow! Real slow!" 
A hairy arm rises from the mist and yanks ASPINALL down. 
EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP 
They panic and break for it- MAGGIE, BILLY, and ANDY for one side, BOBBY and OWEN for the other. 
EXT.  OWEN, WEREWOLF'S POV 
THE CAMERA IS RUSHING THROUGH THE GROUND MIST- this is like being in an airplane that's skimming the top of a cloud. 
WEREWOLF (voice; laughing) "Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!" 
EXT.  OWEN KNOPFLER 
He's hit, as an unlucky swimmer might be hit by a shark. He whirls around, raising the peacemaker bat. 
OWEN Come on, then! You want to rock and roll with me? 
EXT.  THE GROUND MIST, OWEN'S POV 
For a moment there's nothing- and then the werewolf rises out of it, eyes glaring green, muzzle and pelt slimed with gore. 
WEREWOLF "REEEEEL SLOW!" 
EXT.  MAGGIE AND ANDY 
MAGGIE (shrieking) Look at it! Holy God, Andy, look at that thing! 
ANDY (groaning with fear) I don't want to look at it. 
He runs, while MAGGIE stares, mesmerized, at: 
EXT.  OWEN AND THE WEREWOLF 
The WEREWOLF closes in on OWEN, who belts it a good one with the peacemaker. The WEREWOLF swipes at him. OWEN ducks and slams it again. The WEREWOLF roars with anger. 
OWEN Come on, come on! You want to do the bop? I'll bop you, motherfucker! Come on! 
The WEREWOLF dives under the ground mist. 
Uncertain, OWEN begins to back up, holding the bat in his hands. OWEN is jerked down into the mist. He SCREAMS. The peacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down. Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars in pain. CHOMPING SOUND. OWEN shrieks.

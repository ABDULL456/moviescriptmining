LARRY Th-Th-Th-The first time we saw them was last night. We just met them. W-We had... They invited us in for coffee. 
TALL NEIGHBOR Such a... S... Such a nice lady. 
OLD FEMALE NEIGHBOR Nice lady. 
NEIGHBOR WITH A MOUSTACHE Sweet person. 
NEW-YORK - LARRY'S RESIDENCE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Full shot on the entrance of Larry's building. Larry and Carol are coming out. They are very elegantly dressed, Larry wearing a suit and a necktie. 
CAROL God, okay. 
LARRY You look wonderful. 
Paul is coming down the street toward the entrance of the building. He is carrying some grocery in a paper bag. 
CAROL Oh, hallo. 
PAUL Hi. 
CAROL Hi, Mr. House, so... sorry. 
PAUL Thank you so much for those wonderful flowers. 
Paul seems very relax. He smiles a lot, which could be surprising, when we understand he put his wife in the grave only a couple of days ago. 
CAROL Oh. 
PAUL It was quite nice of you. 
CAROL That's... sure. 
LARRY If there's anything we can do. You know, anything you need, just tell us and we'll... 
CAROL No, anything. Anything at all. I mean, God, it's just such a shock when anyone... It was just so sudden. I mean, she seemed so... God, well, healthy. 
LARRY Yeah. 
PAUL She had a heart condition. 
CAROL She did ? She never mentioned it... It... that she was... 
LARRY Ah. 
PAUL She wouldn't have. 
CAROL No. Right. Well... LARRY If there's anything we can do. 
CAROL Yeah, anything. Really. 
LARRY You know, if you need anything, if you are lonely, come by. You know. 
PAUL Thank you. You know, you owe me a wonderful French dessert. 
CAROL Oh, no, no, no. I know, I haven't forgotten. Believe me, I haven't forgotten. 
PAUL Well, have a nice time. You seem all gussied up. 
CAROL Yeah. Oh, I know. We're going to the opera. PAUL Oh, enjoy. 
LARRY My favorite, my favorite. 
PAUL Goodnight. 
He walks away toward the entrance of the building, still smiling a lot and looking very happy. Carol looks at him with a question on her face. 
LARRY Goodnight. 
CAROL Goodnight. 
LARRY Come, we're gonna be late. 
THE METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Long shot on the Met building. 
We hear the music from Wagner's The Flying Dutchman. 
The camera slowly tilts down. We don't see Carol and Larry yet, but we hear their voices. 
CAROL (voice over) The deal was, I sit through the ice hockey game and you watch the whole opera. 
The camera is now on ground level, and we see Carol and Larry coming out of the Met. LARRY I can't listen to that much Wagner, you know. I start to get the urge to conquer Poland. 
They cross the esplanade in front of the Met. 
ELAINE'S RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Elaine's is a cosy place, like there are many around Greenwich Village. 
Carol and Larry are eating at Elaine's with Sy, Marilyn and Ted. Ted is a quite handsome man in his forties. 
We get a medium full view of the party, with a very mobile camera moving around the table and going from one person to another, getting closer to one person, then moving slightly away. 
SY I'll tell you something. I think it's weird. I mean, listen to this. One night she's having coffee, and the next night they are carrying her out in a rubber bag. 
CAROL Oh, I know, I know. And she did not look like she was ready to go. 
TED Maybe this guy killed her, you know ? Like, he's got, like, a young tootsie stashed someplace, or something. 
LARRY No, no, not this... you gotta, you gotta see this guy. This guy gets his jollies from licking the back of postage stamps. He's a-a boring old... 
TED Well, I can see that. Yeah, depending on whose picture is on the stamp. 
CAROL She never once mentioned that she had a heart condition. 
LARRY Well, what is she gonna say ? Oh, yeah, hello, I'm Mrs. House and I have a bad heart. 
CAROL Well, she had no problem telling me about her hysterectomy in the first five minutes. 
SY It is much easier to talk about a hysterectomy than it is to talk about a heart condition. 
TED You said she liked... she liked eating high cholesterol desserts. Is that what you said ? LARRY So, she had one too many. 
CAROL No. No ! She wasn't on a diet. We discussed diets. 
LARRY So she wasn't on a diet. But... 
TED This would be a really great way to kill somebody. 
SY How ? 
TED You clog their arteries with whipped cream, chocolate mousse, butter. They go like that. 
Carol is laughing very heartily at Ted's joke. 
SY That's great. 
LARRY I like a... It's disgusting. 
TED you know what I mean ? 
LARRY It's disgusting, but a... It's fatal. 
TED Wouldn't that be great ? 
MARILYN I'd like to French-pastry myself to death right now. 
SY I'll help you. 
MARILYN I really would.

BRODY Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this. 
ELLEN I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit. 
Brody nods, and holds her hand for a wordless moment. 
QUINT (O.S.) (sings) 'Here is the body of Mary Lee. For 15 years she kept her virginity. Not a bad record for this vicinity.' 
There is a sputter and roar as the Orca's diesels kick on. 
BRODY Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. 
ELLEN (hugging him) What'll I tell the kids? 
BRODY Tell 'em I went fishin'! 
They laugh together, and exchange a short, fierce kiss. 
QUINT Cast off the bow line! Now your stern! 
Its diesels chugging, the Orca pulls away from the pier. 
Ellen has already resolutely turned her back on it, and is walking off the dock back onto dry land. 
ABOARD THE ORCA 
Quint has set a course out towards the open sea. He lashes the wheel, and jumps down to address Hooper and Brody, who are standing together in the stern. 
QUINT (to Brody) Front-Bow, Back-Stern, Port, Starboard. Aloft, Below. It's not a staircase, it's a ladder, it's not a rope, it's a line, and if you don't get it right... (indicates porthole) I'll throw your ass through that little round window. 
He laughs at his joke. This is probably something he tells all his charters. 
QUINT Now hear this. You're aboard the fishing vessel 'Orca,' and I'm her Captain, Master, Mate, and Owner. You'll jump when I holler. We're doin' a job here, and Christ, I ain't got time to watch you birds get hooks in your ass and fall overboard. Ship with me, and you'll do all right. Cross me, and I'll slap you upside your heads. Now -- if you boys are ready -- let's go fishin'. 
He starts moving gear around, preparing chum barrels, setting hooks, Hooper gives him a hand, Brody stays out of the way. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE OCEAN - NOON 
It is quiet as the Orca drifts along in the current, a wide chum slick spreading behind it. A couple of flag buoys spread along our perspective show us the miles the boat has gone. 
Quint spots something in the water -- a small blue shark attracted by the chum. He rigs a small pole with a piece of bait, and throws it over the side. 
QUINT Here's something for you... 
The shark takes the bait, Quint brutally and efficiently sets the hook, and reels the shark alongside. He hauls it part way out of the water, and sticks it with a gaff. Hooper and Brody watch. 
INSERT - SHARK WRIGGLING ON HOOK 
Tailrope dropping on him. Gaffed and bleeding, the shark is immobilized by Quint's practiced hands. He takes one of his big knives and poses for a moment beside the struggling fish. 
QUINT These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat their own guts. 
He slices into the shark's underbelly. We hear the sound of entrails plopping into the water. Brody is almost retching, and Hooper is just displeased. 
ANGLE ON THE WATER 
The gutted shark swimming in circles biting at its own entrails. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Fins closing in on the wounded shark. 
QUINT Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em where you got it! 
SHARK FRENZY 
A boil of water and the flash of fins and teeth as the local sharks erupt in a feeding frenzy, jaws snapping, blood spewing, a sudden display of the fury and blind predatory drive of the fearsome species. 
HOOPER What's that supposed to prove? 
QUINT Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap... 
HOOPER AND BRODY REACT AS WE 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE OCEAN - AFTERNOON 
The Orca is drifting in neutral. The ocean is like gelatin, the sun sucking heat waves from its surface. Brody at the stern, handkerchief on his head to protect from further sunburn, has been handed the slimiest job on a shark hunt: the ladling out of chum. There are several empty chum barrels. A flag buoy bobs in the wake of the boat, another waits to be tossed over the side. Brody is reeling with nausea. He opens his overnight kit and takes out a handkerchief and some Old Spice after-shave. He pours the after-shave into the cloth, presses it to his nose. Hooper is also in the stern.

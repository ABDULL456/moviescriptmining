N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY \nGolden The size of Texas. In a hub of computers and tracking equipment, we find DAN GOLDEN, former  Astronaut from Apollo 8 (first crew to orbit the Moon) and now N.A.S.A's  second-in-command. Golden is watching Shelby on a SERIES OF VIDEO SCREENS.  FLIGHT DIRECTOR WALTER CLARK sits with rows of N.A.S.A Techs. Golden stands over  him, arms on the back o his chair. \nClark Atlantis, what's the problem? \nShelby (V.0) It just isn't working. Any suggestions? \nClarke Hang on Pete. We'll figure something out for you. \nGolden taps Clark and sits down. \nGolden (to Shelby) We got the top scientific minds in the world working on  this. (a slight smile) Try \"whacking\" the thing. \nShelby Okay, Houston, commence whacking. \nSelby begins Whacking the satellite with his glove. The SATELLITE comes n-line,  lights up like a Christmas tree. \nA HORRIFYING RUMBLING SOUND. SHOTGUN LIKE PELLETS assault the satellite.  SHRAPNEL rips into it's delicate gold skin.

These three could land a date if only they would lose  the road flares (plaid shirts, glasses) that signal the painful fact that they  are die-hard science nerds THEO'S POV - THROUGH WKU TELESCOPE - Far off in space  is a dusty, murky swarm of matter - something resembling a FLOATING EXPLOSION. \nJimbo When are we going to let N.A.S.A in on what we've found? \nTheo We don't even know what we have yet. Comet, asteroid - it could be  anything up there. And don't be so eager to red flag N.A.S.A. They don't call us  when they discover anything. \nJimbo Yeah, but this is their sandbox were playing in. \nTheo This is our discovery. We're going to hold a press conference. We're  going to be famous. SPACEWATCH'll name this thing after us. Job offers are going  to fly in from all the big companies. J.P.L., that think tank up at M.I.T., hell  even N.A.S.A.

Everyone remember that? This is what we are  going to do. We're going to fly to that asteroid with a nuclear device, implant  it and get off  before it blows. Quincy? \nAll eyes turn to N.A.S.A. Chief of R&D, RONALD QUINCY. Quincy has coke bottle  glasses and a 198 I.Q. \nQuincy Look: set a fire cracker off in your open palm, you get a third degree  burn. Close your fist, It'll do some serious damage. If we can get a nuke deep  in one of the asteroid's fault lines, she'll split in two, like a diamond. \nGolden You're all looking art us like we're crazy. We're not. \nSkip Dan, our currant shuttle fleet is too old and too slow. \nGolden What I'm going to tell you is a breach of national security and could  land me in jail, but in eighteen days there arnt' gonna be any jails,  so....We're not gonna use a  current shuttle.

N.A.S.A - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY \nGolden Time is our enemy. This is like the race to the Moon, guys - what this  Agency was founded on. \nSkip Boss, we're good at space travel, but you're talkin' about drilling a  hole. \nGolden Quincy's been working on excavating the ice from the Moon - he's gonna  reorient his thinking. Right, Quince? \nQuincy Right. And the first thing I'm gonna do is talk to the guy I ripped  off. His name is Harry S. Stamper. He's the best oil driller in the world. \nGolden I don't care who he is, what he's doing. \nEXT. NORWAY COAST - NORTH SEA - \"TROLL\" OIL RIG - DAY \nSUPER -  DAY TWO \nClose on a GOLF BALL. THWACK! The golf ball EXPLODES off the tee from an oil  rig. The \"TROLL\" is the largest man-made structure in the world - 12 aircraft  carriers big and 1200 feet tall. A self-contained city. \nHARRY STAMPER, world's foremost expert on offshore deep drilling, immaculately  attired in golf attire and spikes, stands on a patch of Astroturf with a five  iron in his hand. Piped-in MOZART drown out the rig noise. \nEXT. \"TROLL\" - DRILLING PLATFORM - \"A\" DERRICK - DAY \nThe main drilling platform. On \"A\" derrick, Chief Driller, A.J. FROST, 30,  handsome, is at the controls. Roughnecks \"JIMBO\" CARTWRIGHT, \"BEAR\" BROWN,  \"CHICK\" CHAPPLE, TITO GUEVARA, and MAX LOGAN, handle 20 foot sections of PIPE  DRILLING SRTRING with a HYDRAULIC TONG AND CLAMP. \nRoughneck BENNIE MORGAN, late 20's an ox of a man, comes across the platform,  pulling an oily green coveralls and donning his hard-hat. Bennie examines the  rig's DOWNHOLE PRESSURE GAUGE. \nBennie Chick! take a look at this! \nChick Pressure's been up all morning. She kicked twice on me. \nA.J.'s eyes move to a TALL BLOND MAN on his lunch break across the rig. \nA.J. What did our always-at-lunch-Swedish geologist say? \nBennie Jah, jah, jah. No bleeper. Too much pressure. \nChick You askin' the old man? \nA.J. nods and walks off. \nEXT. \"TROLL\" RIG - TOP TIER \nHarry HITS another ball. WE REVEAL his target, a GREENPEACE BOAT anchored off  the rig. The BALL strikes the side of the boat, just missing the head of ONE of  the PROTESTERS. \nHarry Almost caught that little bastard. \nHe admires his shot as his daughter, GRACE, walks up. Grace is late 20's,  business dress, Harvard Law. \nGrace Having fun? \nHarry HITS another ball. It misses the boat, skips across the water. \nGrace Sure sliced the shit outta that one. (frowns) \nHarry Watch your language, Gracie. \nGrace Seagulls swallow those and they die. \nHarry Stupid birds. \nHarry's EYES move to a GROUP OF GREENPEACE PROTESTERS across the rig, being held  back by Stamper Oil SECURITY GUARDS. \nGrace I just talked with A.J. \nHarry Talking to him quite a bit these days.... \nGrace (awkward pause) \"A\" rig's acting up. The drill string kicked twice this morning, gave Chick a nasty bruise in the head. \nHarry Good. He's not vulnerable there. \nHarry Bennie! Third gear! \nThe Greenpeace Leader miraculously produces a key and frantically begins  unlocking the handcuffs. \nGrace turns to the oil executives. \nGrace He's good at public relations. \nA.J. approaches Grace; they watch Harry. \nGrace So? (A.J. stares at her) What? (no response) What? (no response) A.J.? \nSuddenly, across \"A\" Derrick, a KLAXON SOUNDS. \nChick She's kickin'! \nThe civilians get the hell away. \nHarry and A.J. run toward the rig. \nChick Pressure's north of seven thousand! \nA.J. We gotta clear the Derrick! \nHarry (looks at wellhead) Chick, rig up another pipe. (Chick and Bennie look  at Harry with uncertainty) NOW, NOT TOMORROW. \nCHick and Bennie begin clamping, and tong a PIPE STRAND onto the DRILL STRING  like an INDY PIT STOP CREW. \nA.J. Harry, we've hit pressure. We gotta bleed it off. e go any deeper, we'll  blow the rig. \nHarry Thanks for that opinion. Chick, full speed! \nA.J. The bit's five thousand feet down! Full speed'll rip the pipe apart! \nHarry You learn all this in college? I been doing this thirty years, kid. Get  on the controls. \nA.J. moves reluctantly to the DRILLING CONTROLS. Chick nods to A.J., who engages  the gears. The PIPE STRING turns at FULL SPEED. The new drill pipe descends ten  feet into the hole, then.... \nThe torque rips the NEWLY ATTACHED PIPE from the drilling string. The drill  spins freely. \nA.J. hits the \"stop! lever and stares at Harry. \nThe roughnecks converge around the wellhead. \nA.J. I'm goin' down. Reattach it. Gimme a wrench and a band coupling. \nChick hand the items to A.J. \nA.J. descends into the drilling hole. \nINT. DOWN THE DRILLING HOLE - DAY \nA.J., holding his breath under water, shimmies down the drilling pipe  feet-first, inside the water-filled concrete tube running from the rig to the  ocean floor. \nA.J. begins wrestling the disconnected sections together. EXT. RIG - \"A\" DERRICK \nThe wellhead KICKS. The rig platform shakes and shudders. SEAWATER erupts from  the wellhead. \nChick The drill hole's flooding! \nGrace A.J.!! \nHarry strips off his jacket and climbs into the wellhead. He takes a huge breath  and disappears into the brine-filled drilling hole. \nINT. DRILLING HOLE \nA.J. is pinned against the hole wall by one of the disconnected pipes. Harry  comes down the hole. He plants his back against the hole wall and kicks the  pipe, freeing A.J. A slow, deep, RUMBLE emanates from below. The Briny water  inside the hole suddenly turns BLACK and VISCOUS. \nA.J. and Harry exchange an alarmed look. Harry, then A.J., pull for the surface,  up the drilling hole as -- \nEXT. DRILLING PLATFORM - \"A\" DERRICK - DAY \n-- the wellhead KICKS again. The rig platform SHUDDERS violently. The derrick  sways. SEAWATER SPEWS up from the wellhead. \nChick Get back, she's gonna blow! \nGrace, Chick, Bennie and the other Roughnecks huddle around the flooded drilling  hole, waiting. Tense, agonising seconds pass. \nHarry scrambles out, covered in....CRUDE OIL. \nHe grabs Grace and pulls her away. \nGrace Where's A.J.!!!? \nHarry RIGHT BEHIND ME! RUN! \nThe platform SHAKES. Harry, Grace, and the others sprint away as \nA GEYSER OF CRUDE OIL erupts from the drilling hole, blowing A.J. out of the  hole fifteen feet above the wellhead. A.J. crashes to the platform floor. \nCRUDE OIL rains down on Grace and the Roughnecks...they run to A.J. \nGrace Never do that again! \nCLOSE ON A.J. - he's looking back at the DRILL HOLE, panting, traumatised,  greasy oil raining on his head. \nA.J. You know how I told you there were two obstacles? I didn't do the  first,'cause he's tough...but I did the second...! (pulls out case; opens it) I  got it at uhm..Tiffany's. I can't give it to you until I talk to him, but try it on. \nQuincy eagerly outstretches his hand. They shake. Quincy doesn't let go. \nQuincy I'm a big fan, Mr. Stamper. \nHarry I kinda caught that. (to Golden) What's the problem, gentlemen? \nGolden I wonder if we might speak alone? \nHarry These two are my right and left arms. Grace Stamper and Albert Jack  Frost. Stupid name, so we call him A.J.. (handshakes) They run my company. You  talk to me, you  talk to them. \nGolden Okay. \nGolden direct everyone into -- \nINT. N.A.S.A. - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY \nGolden, Temple, Clark, Harry, Grace, and A.J. sit in a dark room viewing a  VIDEOTAPE. Quincy stands beside the projector, supplying narration. On the tape  we see Harry on a rig platform shaking hands with an ARAB BUSINESSMAN -- \nHarry Great, home movies. \nGrace and A.J. smile. \nQuincy Nineteen eighty five. The first well drilled over 50 thousand feet.  They said it couldn't be done. You did it. Incredible. \nON THE SCREEN - Harry's on another rig, shaking hands with an INDONESIAN  BUSINESSMAN. Harry leans over and kisses the bit. The Businessmen shake their  heads, awed. \nQuincy (cont'd) Nineteen Ninety-One. Directional drilling through two miles of anthracite. They also said that couldn't be done. You did it. Incredible. \nHarry looks at Quincy strangely; this sure is a bizarre form of celebrity. \nQuincy (cont'd) Ninteen Ninety-Three. The first hole over seventy thousand. Once again they said -- \nGolden Move it along, Quincy. \nQuincy Right, sorry. Mister Stamper, you're the world's foremost expert in  deep drilling. You hold specialized patents in high speed bits, drilling fluids,  downhole motors Can I call you Harry? \nHarry Stick with Stamper. \nGolden Well, Mister Stamper, we need you to drill a hole. It's in a difficult  place. \nHarry I've drilled in them all. \nGolden Not...this place. This is really out there. (beat) Space, Mister  Stamper. \nHarry As in...outer? \nSATELLITE PHOTOS OF THE ASTEROID come up on the screen -- \nTemple You've watched the news the last 24 hours? You heard about the meteor  shower? (Harry nods) What you don't know is that an asteroid is on a collision course with  Earth. If it hits us, Earth as we know it will be over. \nGolden We're manning a mission to that asteroid to plant a nuclear device in  it's core. To do that we need to drill an eight hundred foot hole. \nHarry looks at A.J. and Grace. \nHarry A.J., is this guy shitting me? \nA.J. I don't think they shit people at N.A.S.A., Harry -- \nHarry An eight hundred foot hole. On a moving asteroid. In space. \nGolden All we want is your advice in perfecting our drilling arm, any help you  can provide. We'll pay your usual consultancy, of course. \nHarry Show me your rig. \nINT. N.A.S.A. - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY \nQuincy leads Golden, Harry, A.J., Grace, and Clark through N.A.S.A.'s Research  and Development area. This place looks like \"Q's\" weapons shop from the James  Bond movies as funded by every company on the fortune 500 -- \nHuge, clinically clean, dominated by MASSIVE ROCKET ENGINES. TECHNICIANS in  white coats and hairnets work on a variety of equipment. \nTECHNICIANS hunch over a ROVER VEHICE, not the golf cart used on the moon. This  is low, squat, sturdy, with an enclosed airlocked passenger compartment. \nQuincy The \"Armadillo\" - our fourth generation rover. It carries a six-cell  solar engine with 824 horses. This was a joint venture with the Germans. (winks) It's designed by Porsche. \nQuincy motions to TWO TECHNICIANS. They roll over a ROBOTIC ARM on a gurney,  powered by an ELECTRIC MOTOR. The robotic arm is connected to an OIL DRILLING  BIT. \nHarry Where's the Kelly? \nQuincy This baby works without one. \nHarry How does it work? \nHarry starts to inspect the bit. \nQuincy It works through a series of complexly designed differential gears. \nHarry's face tightens, as he studies the bit further -- \nHarry This is my Patent. \nQuincy \"Drilling Power Transfer Without Conventional Hydraulics,\" by Harry S.  Stamper. You registered it with the U.S. Patent Office last year. \nHarry You stole it. \nQuincy We just borrowed it, Mister Stamper. \nQuincy unpockets a remote control panel and presses a button. The drill bit  presses down into a block of concrete and begins to rapidly CHEW through it, as  Harry marvels at the realisation of his design. \nChick We're living LARGE! \nBennie (talking on a cellular phone) Give me nickels on Miami, Washington, San  Diego, and Green Bay. (listens) Quit whining. Last thing I need is to be friends  with my bookie. (listens, then angry) \n(MORE) \nBennie (cont'd) Look, when the entire Mexican Army had Butch and the Sundance Kid trapped in that Hacienda, did they wait to die? Hell no. They went out guns  blazing. I live  by the code of that movie, man. \nBennie hangs up the phone, he looks across from him at -- Tito Guevara, late  30's, stocky, tattooed, Latino, (reformed 118th Street L.A. o.g. gangbanger who  was rescued from the streets ten years back and put to work on a rig by Harry) is reading a book \"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus.\" \nChick drops down into his seat, continues his heated discussion with Max. \nChick Charlie Bronson could kick Steve McQueen's ass and have enough left over  to duke it out with Burt Reynolds in his \"Smokey and the Bandit\" period. \nMax I'm glad you qualified that shit 'cause you know the Burt Reynolds of  \"Deliverence\" would have kicked Charlie's ass. \nChick Burt was trouble in that flick. \nMax What would you say the all-time, slam-bam, take-no-prisoners, kick-ass  Charlie Bronson movie is? \nChick All time? Well, let me think. \"Dirty Dozen,\" the first \"Death Wish.\" No,  no! That movie where he hunted the buffalo. I don't remember the name but he  hunted a buffalo and he said like three words during the whole picture. That's my  selection. \nMax Fine. The buffalo movie. That's your pick. You relly think that buffalo  Charlie could have thrown-down with the Steve McQueen form \"Bullitt?\" \nChick He'da whooped his ass and then his father's. We'll settle this right  now. Rockhound? You heard the debate. You're the Supreme Court. What's the final  verdict? \nRockhound Tough call. But for me though, one name -- Poncherello. Eric  Estrada. You know, \"Chips.\" \nChick and Max just look at him. A beat. Then -- \nMax What did you ask him for? Guy makes his living looking at rocks. \nThe limo pulls over and stops. The DRIVER gets out and walks to the rear door.  Opens it. \nEXT. N.A.S.A. - FRONT OF FACILITY - DAY \nThe Roughnecks get out in front of the JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. They stare up at  the familiar N.A.S.A. LOGO imprinted on the building. Chick and Bennie exchange  looks -- \nBEHIND THEM \nA battered Ford pick-up pulls up, driven by 71 year-old \"MAMA\" MABEL BROWN.  Mabel's six foot-five, 375 pound son, BEAR, gets out of the car. \nBear 'Bye, Mama. \nMabel Reginald, get over here and kiss your Mama goodbye. \nBear In front of the guys? \nMabel Never too old to kiss your Mama. \nJIMBO, six-foot five, 375 pounds, bald, pulls up on a HARLEY DAVIDSON  motorcycle. He climbs off the bike. \nChick There ain't no oil in this place. What the hell are we doing here? \nINT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - MEDICAL WING - DAY \nHarry has just briefed his crew on the mission. \nBear ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? \nChick Harry, this is some \"Star Wars\" shit. This ain't for us. \nHarry It's a job, like any other. Just a different location. \nMax We work rigs. We understand rigs. We don't know dick about being  astronauts. \nRockhound (pointing) I might add that to get us up there they're going to have  to strap our asses on one of those rockets. That means fire, involuntary shit  release, and a slew of other stuff I can't hang with. \nJIMBO We don't have \"The Right Stuff,\" know what I'm saying? (looking around) We're Roughnecks. \nHarry I'd rather die up there fighting this thing than sit  here waiting for it. \nHarry's line hangs in the air. Everyone exchanges looks. \nBear I don't like the idea of waiting around to croak. It's wimpy. \nChick If Harry-the-iron-ass is going, I'm going with him. \nBear Hell, I'm going just so I can say I went. (shrugs) Once we get up there,  it's making hole. \nTito I'm in. \nINT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY \nMax, Chick, and Tito sit in HOSPITAL SMOCKS on two examination tables. They have  tattoos, long hair. A cigarette dangles from Tito's lips. AIR FORCE NURSES are  everywhere. A NURSE clips a SWATCH OF HAIR from each of the men. She comes to  Tito. He grabs her arm. Takes the scissors from her. \nTito Nobody touches my hair but me. \nHe cuts a SWATCH of hair, gives it to her. A SECOND NURSE is in front of Max and  Tito. \nMax You're not taking any more blood. You vampires already have enough to feed  your coven for a year. \nNurse (nasally-voiced) We need to know what substances you've recently  ingested. \nTito What, uhh, \"substances\" you talkin' about? \nNurse (matter of fact) Drugs. \nChick and Max hurry off. A.J. smiles at Harry. \nINT. JOHNSON CTR - ASTRONAUT TRAINING - WORKROOM - DAY \nHarry, A.J., Bennie, Chick, Max, and Tito sit before Quincy, who demonstrates a  series of components on the N.A.S.A. SPACE SUIT. \nQuincy The new generation EMU - Extravehicular Mobility Unit - provides oxygen  for seven hours, a pressurised enclosure, and temperate control. The gloves and  helmet slide  on and lock with a twist, like this. The cap is worn underneath. It  contains a mike and headphones for two-way communication. We'll be able to see  you from a small  video cam mounted inside the helmet. The Undergarment has 300 feet  of plastic tubing circulating cooling water. Owen... \nOWEN THE TAILOR, five foot nothing & bald, stands in front of the men. \nOwen These are made for men 5'8\" to 6'2\", between 140 and 200 pounds. All of  you fit within those parameters - thank God we won't have to do any  re-tailoring.... \nOwen stops because -- \nBear and Jimbo stand in the doorway -- \nJIMBO Yo. This where we get our suits? \nBear Sorry, we're late. Doc said we had... What do we got? \nJIMBO Cholesterol difficulties. Said we gotta enter \"The Zone.\" \nBear Shit, the only zone I know is the one around my mama's grill. \nJIMBO (holding up form) But we're approved. \nOwen looks at the human mountains standing before hi, and then at the tiny EMU  suit. Alterations will be necessary. \nINT. JOHNSON CENTER - ASTRONAUT TRAINING - MORNING \nClark briefs Harry and the mildly attentive Roughnecks. Sharp, Truman, CO-PILOTS  MEGAN WATTS (30's, tough as nails) and STAN WESTON stand in the back along with  N.A.S.A. Engineers JACK CROSS and RAYMOND SEARS. \nClark United States astronauts train for eighteen months. You have nine days.  Officers Sharp, Truman, Watts and Weston are your military instructors and the  only pilots to have flown the spacecraft. (beat) Each is a combat decorated officer  and among the finest men and women we have in the service. Pay attention to  them. \nSharp We spend six months on emergency training - we're throwing that out. If  we fail, everyone dies. Game over. That's a heavy load but it's ours to carry.  The purpose of this is to train you in the physical and mental rigors of working  in a weightless enviroment so that you will not panic. So you can do your jobs. (beat) You will vomit.  Your eyes will be sucked into the back of your heads. You'll be so  tired you can't eat but that won't matter 'cause you'll be so sore you can't  take a dump. By the way...good morning. \nINT. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY TANK - DAY \nSplash, Splash. Harry and the Roughnecks descend underwater. They look like  Michelin Men in their thick space suits. Navy divers are around them as they are  lined up. \nThrough the underwater speaker, WE HEAR a trainer giving them instructions for  their weightless aerobic training. WE HEAR a loud, embarrassing gastric sound  from Bear's suit. \nBear Houton, we have a problem. That is some vicious methane. \nHarry gives a \"shut the fuck up\" look. Time passes as the guys are dying,  HUFFING and PUFFING. One by one, they reach exhaustion. A cabled harness hoists  each out. \nINT. JOHNSON CENTER - CARDIO LAB - DAY \nHarry and his team, in T-shirts and running shorts, jog on a series of  threadmills, wired to EKG machines, nostrils taped shut, breathing tubes locked  in their mouths. EXT. N.A.S.A. T-38 JET HANGER - DAY \nA gleaming spit-shine hanger full of fifteen N.A.S.A. T-38 fighter jets. Our  drill team walks up looking worn out. They are met at the open hanger door by  pilots CHUCK JR., Vietnam vet, leatherneck-take-no-pussy-bullshit-type-of-guy  and HAMMER. \nChuck Jr. On this mission, they tell me you will experience the worst G-Forces  in the history of flight. It's like an elephant sitting on your chest. So, I  intend to flip you, spin you, splat your bodies till your bones hurt. Now load up and  enjoy the flight. \nThe Roughnecks, wearing flight suits and helmets, board the planes. Harry does  not like the look of these things. Bear is trying to figure out how to fit  inside. \nBear Thing's made for a child - like my kid's car seat. \nChuck Jr. and Hammer walk up to a nervous Harry. \nChuck Jr. What's the problem, Texas tough guy? \nHarry I've got a thing about flying. \nChuck Jr. Not good for an astronaut. (looks to Hammer) Hammer, go easy, don't  rip his guts out. \nHammer Sure thing, Chuck. \nINT. JET FIGHTER. \nHarry plastered to the seat, MOANING so scared he can't puke. The plane  barrel-rolls and dives straight to the ground. Harry is GRUNTING and sweating  trying to stay conscious. \nEXT. N.A.S.A. T-38 JET HANGER - DAY \nThe T-38's are pulling up and letting the drill crew out. They walk back with  white sweat, soaked faces and wobbly legs. Harry exits the plane. \nHarry I hate to fly. I hate to fly. I hate it so much. \nHarry leans over to puke. \nINT. N.A.S.A. T-38 JET HANGER - DAY \nThe Roughnecks walking to the T-38 Hanger. Sharp stands on the stairway to the  707 and calls everyone to attention. \nSharp Trainees, AT EASE (in command) We are not done here. We're taking you  for a little ride. This bird will climb to 40 thousand feet and drop to 10  thousand feet to give  you the feeling of weightlessness for 30 seconds. Welcome to  N.A.S.A.'s Vomit Comet. INT. VOMIT COMET \nThe plane drops. The Roughnecks lift off inside. Everyone's flying around the  cabin. It's a disaster. Guys bump heads. Bear floats like a beached whale. Jimbo  rams the roof. Hary hold a barf bag as he floats. An alarm SOUNDS, then the  plane levels off, the guys go slamming into the floor. \nINT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER BATHROOM \nTracking past a row of stalls, WE SEE the soles of a pair of shoes peeking out.

My wife ran off with a drill-rigger, left me with Grace. Everybody in town thought I  was a fool. But I stayed with it. And in the last hour of the last day, she  popped. She spit out that black gold and I danced in it like a wild Indian. (reflective ) I  captured the magic (holding medal) This is the last piece of pipe that struck  gold that day. \nHarry takes off the medal. Sets it on the table.

Harry and the men standing there, just watching.  Devastated, confused, in shock. This is a total catastrophe. The mission is  over. \nSharp nods to Pitts. Pitts picks up the REMOTE NUCLEAR DETONATOR. \nSharp Stamper, you ready to blow this? Let's get outta here...! \nHarry ignores him. He won't accept defeat. \nHarry Chick, get your butt over here. \nChick drags his ass over to Harry. \nChick Yeah. \nHarry We're gonna fix this - make it work. If we weld those two together and  go in one speed.... \nChick Harry.... \nHarry Get your ass up here! \nChick doesn't move. The two men stare at each other. \nChick I've been with you fourteen years. I've never said this to you, never  thought I would. It's over. \nChick walks off toward the shuttle. Bear joins him. \nHarry, atop of the Armadillo, looks around. His head drops...he's burning up.  His fist clenches the HALF MEDALLION in his hand (where is it - clipped to suit  - in pouch of suit?) His eyes shut tightly. He is going to will victory from  defeat. He will not give up. \nCAMERA'S at low angle, giving Harry a larger-than-life look. \nHarry hears something. A LOW RUMBLE. It is confusing. It sounds like......an  ARMADILLO ENGINE. \nHarry opens his eyes.

Bear, atop the drilling  platform, is working on something with a wrench. \nBear accidently drops his wrench. It falls on the turbine's RIPPED MESH  PROTECTIVE SCREEN and hangs there. Bear looks at it nervously and reaches...THE  WRENCH falls into the turbine spinning at six-thousand r.p.m. With a GRINDING  SQUEAL, the wrench shrapnel blows out of the turbine and -- \nTHE DRILLING ARM reverses speeds and VIOLENTLY THRUSTS THE PIPE FORWARD,  buckling it. A piece of the drill string is BLOWN OUT, smashing into Sharp's  helmet, spider-webbing his faceshield. He's out cold. \nHarry and the guys dive away from the hole. Chick, confused, works the clutch  furiously to no avail. THE DRILLING ARM RAMS THE PIPE back down the hole, where  it BUCKLES, BENDS AND BREAKS IN HALF. \nTito tends to Sharp..his face has lost all color. Harry approaches the hole.  Looks down. FIFTY FEET DOWN IS A MESS OF MANGLED PIPE, blocking the hole. \nINT.

A.J. walks over to  Sharp...who's coming to now. \nHarry (to Golden) Oh yeah, Golden? \nGolden (V.O.) Go ahead, Harry. \nHarry Your shuttle pilot just took a nasty shot from a drill string.... \nGolden Is he alright? \nHarry I hope so, he's gotta get us off this shithole. \nINT. DRILLING HOLE \nA.J, tied to a SAFETY TETHER, comes down the hole with a HAND- HELD CUTTER and a  LENGTH OF ROPE. He reaches the obstruction. The DRILL PIPE has been mashed,  bent, buckled. Severed ends stab into the sides of the hole. A.J. starts cutting  with the hand- held cutter. \nEXT. DRILLING HOLE \nThe guys stand there, watching. Nothing happens. Agonising seconds pass.  Suddenly the ground rumbles. Another EARTHQUAKE. It slowly starts to subside. \nINT. DRILLING HOLE \nThe hole shakes. A.J. freezes, sweating. \nHarry (V.O.) A.J., we need you.

DRILLING HOLE \nA.J. experiences the DEEPEST, MOST SINISTER RUMBLE YET, emanating form the  asteroid's core, something from hell. There's a horrendous WHOOSHING SOUND. \nGolden The situation: the hole is drilled but the remote detonator is not  functional. One of the crew is going to stay behind and.... (deep breath) ...manually detonate the device. \nGolden looks over at Grace. She is stunned. The news is just sinking in. \nGolden Don't stay for this. \nGrace I'm not leaving. \nTemple In 18 minutes we will be at Zero Barrier. (to Grace) Your father better  be a man of his word. \nINT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - CABIN \nPAN FROM HARRY...to A.J. to...to Chick....to Lev...to Bear.

But we need two people  to fly this mother back. So, we either all stay or you guys draw. \nSharp raises a BUNDLE OF ELECTRICAL WIRES in his hand. The crew's going to draw  straws. The highest tension yet. No one breathes, no one moves. \nSharp Who's first? (no response) Clockwise then. \nSharp holds the WIRE STRAND BUNDLE in front of Lev. \nLev stares at it. He smiles nervously and reaches...and draws. The strand is  LONG. Lev exhales. Next... \nChick, Chick stares at the bundle, sweating. He grabs a strand. Pulls slowly.  LONG. He exhales. Next... \nBear. He stares at the bundle, thinking, choosing. He grabs and pulls quickly,  decisively. LONG. Two strands remain, and two men, Harry and A.J. It's A.J.'s  turn.... \nA.J. stares at the wire strands - not a bundle now. A.J. shifts in his chair.  The matter will be decided on this last pull. A.J. looks at Harry. They lock  eyes. \nHarry Your turn. \nA.J. I ain't gonna draw against you Harry. \nChick (starts to get up) I can't watch this. \nHarry (stern, hard) Sit down, Chick. \nChick sits down. Harry looks at A.J. \nHarry Draw. \nA.J. stares at the two strands. Gets used to the idea. He reaches and begins to  pull. Stops. Chooses the other strand. And pulls. It is SHORT. A.J. stares at  the SHORT STRAND OF WIRE in his hand. We see a fear on his face that gets  covered by a small smile. \nA.J. Well, I guess I won. Now I'm the guy who gets to save the Earth. \nA.J. takes off the half medallion. Harry takes off his half medallion. \nA.J. We said we'd join these after we drilled the hole. It just ain't gonna be  on Earth. \nThey slide the two halves together to make a whole. Harry and A.J. exchange a  long look. \nINT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT \nWatts flips switches.

The NUKE descends downhole, slowly spooling out wire from the  SPOOL DRUM. \nA.J. About Grace, Harry. (laughs nervously) I know it ain't gonna happen now,  but....if things were different...What would you say...? \nHarry walks back toward Freedom. A.J. follows. \nHarry I always wanted a son. And if I had....I'd want him to be like you. \nHarry hands him the pipe section. \nHarry (cont'd) You're going to need some magic in the world.

TECHNICIANS smile. No one  is more relieved than Grace. \nINT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT \nSharp and Watts stare through the windshield at -- \nTHE ASTEROID, below them and dead ahead. We get our first (and only temporary) clear glimpse of the designated landing field, a relatively smooth, unobstructed  plane on the asteroid's surface. \nHarry is green, looks like he's gonna blow chunks. \nSharp We're awake, we're not pukin'.... (looks over shoulder at Harry) ....well, Harry is. And we got a clear path to the target. Houston, over. \n", "test2_true": "Truman smiles. \nTruman Copy that, Freedom. \nINT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL \nClark gives Golden a thumbs up. \nClark We'll take you in, guys. \nEXT. SHUTTLES FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE \nFreedom, in the lead, and Independence, following to the rear and side, descend  through the debris-less corridor to the waiting asteroid. \nSuddenly a CLOUD OF ICE AND PEBBLES wafts in front of the Shuttles. \nINT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM COCKPIT \nIn one terrifying second, visibility is cut to twenty feet. Then BANG! BANG!  BANG! BANG! \nPEBBLES and SMALL ICE CHUNKS strike the windshield, chipping and denting it. The  impacts are violent; the interior is buffeted around. It's the space equivalent  of bad hailstorm. \nSharp Damn it....! \nClark (V.O) What is it, Willie? \nSharp Problem, Houston. We've got debris all over us! \nREAR OF COCKPIT - Harry and the others, alarmed, are buffeted around violently. \nINT. SHUTTLE INDEPENDENCE - COCKPIT \nNo visibility here either. Ice chunks and pebbles BANG against the windshield. \nTruman I've got no visibility. I've lost orientation to the target! \nSuddenly, as sudden as it came, the debris clears. \nBut a HUGE ICE BOULDER the size of a three-story building twirls into  Independence's path. It hits a BOULDER which collides with another. \nTruman Big guy! Dead ahead! \nTruman stabs his directional thruster button. Shuttle Independence veers to the  right.... \nINT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM \nSharp hits his directional thruster, and Freedom veers to the left.... \nEXT. THROUGH THE ASTEROID'S TAIL \nFreedom goes left, Independence right, splitting the ice boulder. \nFreedom clears the ice boulder by a foot. Independence, not so lucky, clips the  ice boulder, ripping her left thruster clean off. With one thruster,  Independence careens out of control, twirling and spinning. \nINT. SHUTTLE INDEPENDENCE \nTruman (panicked) I lost left thruster! No control! I have no control! \nIn the Independence's cargo bay, one of the Armadillos RIPS free from its  moorings and plunges through the CARGO BAY DOORS. \nINT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM \nSharp steers Freedom past the ice boulder. \nWatts Where's the other ship....?! \nSuddenly the Independence, with a RIPPED OPEN CARGO BAY DOOR, careens directly  across Freedom's path, filling Freedom's cockpit window, nearly colliding with  her. \nSharp hits his thrusters, veering away from the damaged Independence. \nSharp and Watts watch Independence twirling toward the asteroid. Suddenly  BANG!!! \nThe INDEPENDENCE'S ERRANT ARMADILLO strikes the Freedom's nose, spider-webbing  the WINDSHIELD. Sharp and Watts recoil in terror. Watts SCREAMS. \nINT. SHUTTLE INDEPENDENCE \nThe fuselage is spinning. A.J., Bennie and the others are in terror. In the  cockpit, Truman SCREAMS over the radio \nTruman Houston, MAYDAY, MAYDAY, we're going down! \nThe Shuttle's roof collides with a rock. We hear SCRAPING METAL. The CEILING  dents in, dislodging INTERIOR CEILING PANELS filled with wires and electrical  components; they rain down on A.J. and the others. \nChoas. The SPARKING CABIN fills with smoke. \nTruman Crew, go to life support! \nEveryone grabs for their HELMET, frantically trying to get them on. A.J. gets  his on, but he can't lock his neck seal. He fidgets with the little SEAKL LOCKS. \nA.J. rips off the helmet. It slips from his fingers and floats off through the  zero-g cabin! \nA.J. Goddamn it! \nA.J. throws off his seat harnesses and goes after his helmet. In zero-gravity,  the sides of the twirling cockpit revolve around A.J. as he moves. \nINT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL \nWe hear a CACOPHONY OF VOICES and BANGING ROCKS against Independence's fuselage. \n", "test3_input": "Golden A surface detonation isn't going to do it, General. My scientists have  already told you that. It must be detonated inside the asteroid. The alternative  is that the Earth  will be bombarded by smaller matter which will be just as  catastrophic. \nTemple stares off pensively into the sky. \nTemple We have a lot better chance of surviving the \"smaller matter.\" The  drillers have two hours (to the Aides) I want you ready on my command. \nThe Adjutants prepare the nuclear command link. \nMilitary Adjutant Sir, we have interface with the weapon. Remote detonator  standing by. \nINT. INDEPENDENCE - CRASH SITE \nLev is sitting on the ground, head in his hands, completely demoralised. \nLev I feel like Skywalker Luke when he learn Darth Vader his father. What I  should do? \nA.J. Get up, we got work to do. \nLev A.J., let me cash in my chips. \nA.J. Lev, we're getting off this rock, if I have to drag your ass the whole  way. (off Lev's look) Now get up! \nA.J. walks into the Independence cargo bay, detached from the nose section. Then  climbs into Independence's Armadillo. \nA.J. C'MON LEV, PUT YOUR WEIGHT INTO IT! \nEXT. INDEPENDENCE - WRECKAGE OF CARGO BAY \nLev is prying open the cargo bay ramp door (the hydraulics are shot) \nLEV YOU COME PUSH, YANKEE.... \nINT. - MISSION CONTROL \nGolden turns to Temple. \nGolden The asteroid's surface is heating up. \nTemple What does that mean? \nGolden It means they may not be able to work on the surface for much longer.  The temperatures will be unbearable. \nEXT. INDEPENDENCE - WRECKAGE OF CARGO BAY \nThe Armadillo, engine rumbling, is poised to roll Independence's long tubular  NUCLEAR WEAPON which has been ejected with other debris from the broken  fuselage. \nLev Wait A.J.! We drive over nuclear weapon and we finished before we started. \nA.J. So move it. \nLev jams a pipe between the ARMING DEVIC and the nuke. As he rolls the nuke  over, the arming device detaches, rips off, and clatters to the ground. \nINT. MISSION CONTROL \nTemple Golden, tell your drillers the clock is ticking. I have 6 billion  people down here relying on them! \nIn the b.d. hangs a crayon drawing of sunny day by Temple's daughter. \nTemple (cont'd) A lot of people are die.... \nINT. INDEPENDENCE - CRASH SITE \nThe ARMADILLO blasts through the cargo bay door. A.J. and Lev roll off away from  the Independence. \nA.J. cranes his neck looking out through the Armadillo. A RIDGE with THRE TALL  SPIRES is in the distance, ringed with LIGHT from Freedom's FLOOD LIGHTS. \nA half-smile from A.J hope. \nINT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM \nSharp comes back from the cockpit, carrying the detonator. Harry's on the phone  to Golden. \nHarry ...You told me that the only way to deal with this hunk 'o crud is to  get a nuke 1000 feet down. You sticking with that? \nGolden (V.O.) Firmly. \nHarry Great. Glad we have that understanding. \nGolden (V.O.) IF you're gonna pull this off, we have to have a little talk about time...and temperature. Zero Barrier's in two hours. \nHarry Wait...wait..what about temperature? When did temperatures come into the  picture? \nGolden (V.O.) Harry, your suits are good upto 150 degrees Celsius.... \nHarry And...? How hot is it going to get? \nGolden (V.O.) We didn't anticipate you being on the asteroid so long. The clock is ticking... \nHarry How hot is it going to get?! \nGolden (V.O.) Three hundred and fifty degrees. \nHarry's face drops. \nHarry Thanks for telling us now, Golden....I don't think my bits can handle  those kind of temperatures.... \nINT. FREEDOM - CARGO BAY \n", "test3_true": "Watts We've still gotta fix this shuttle, Stamper. \nHarry Give me some more good news. You've got two new assistants who can fix  your shuttle. Bear, Max, hop to it. There's not a machine they can't fix. We can  handle the hole from here. \nEXT. SHUTTLE FRREDOM \nThe airlock opens. Sharp and Pitts are led out by Harry. \nHarry Colonel Sharp, if we're going to blow this hole, you gotta help ME. I  need some more manpower.... \nEXT. FREEDOM DRILL SITE - MINUTES LATER \nThe SECOND ARMADILLO rumbles out of Freedom's cargo bay. Chick and the  Roughnecks work like a NASCAR pit crew. Sharp and Pitts lay on their backs  holding down a 1000 pound axle, fighting zero-g. \nSuddenly, the ground begins to tremble. \nEXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - FRONT OF \"THREE SPIRES RIDGE\" \nA.J.'s ARMADILLO rumbles over a little hill revealing the RIDGE WTH THREE SPIRES  directly in front of them. THE SUN is moving over the asteroid's FAR HORIZON,  causing a \"sunrise.\" It is breathtaking, spiritual...and frighteningly bright. \nINT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO \nA.J. Over the hill. \nSuddenly, the ground under the vehicle shakes sharply. A.J. stops the Armadillo. \nThe ground around the vehicle heaves up and down. The GROUND SPLITS. One  TECTONIC PLATE rises 15 feet in the air. The ground breaks like a wave, up and  down. \nINT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE \nHere, too, the ground shakes. Bear, terrified, drops a DRILL PIPE. Max is shaken  to the ground. \nChick is nearly thrown off the Armadillo. \nChick Clear the rig!!! \nChick jumps down, bouncing. Everybody gets the hell away from the drilling hole. \nINT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO \nThe asteroid shakes violently, throwing A.J. and Lev around the cab. ROCKS BANK  down on the Armadillo's top and hood. The ASTEROID SURFACE continues splitting  apart across the slope's fall line. \nA.J. EARTHQUAKE! \nThe asteroid RUMBLES a few more seconds, then the quake slowly stops. All is  stll. \nA.J. (cont'd) Let's take a look. \nEXT. ASTEROID SURFACE \nLev gets out; he nervously paces back and forth across the lip of the fissure. \nLev This bad. (repeating, mantra) Darth Vader. Darth Vader. \nA.J. Listen, Mr. Negative. Everyone thinks we're dead. We're not. So, suck it  up. Because if we don't drill that hole, six billion people are going to die.  And I'm not lettin' Harry Stamper get all the freaking credit for saving the world. (firm) We're gona do this, then we're going home. \nLev I l-o-v-e this American confidence! Like John Wayne. (sotto) This why I  suspect you won Cold War. \nA.J. Hep me get these rocks over there. \nA.J. and Lev start dragging rocks to use as a \"kicker ramp\" for the jump. Lev is  oblivious. They pull embedded rock out, revealing DIAMONDS. A.J. holds up a  large chunk. \nA.J. (cont'd) This outta cut into a sweet wedding ring. \nLev (holding chunk) With this I can rebuild my MIR. \nEXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE \nChick, Bear, and Max cautiously approach the drill hole. Everything seems okay.  Chick climbs back up to the drill-drive platform. \nChick Back to work! \nBear grabs the drill pipe and hoists it... back to work. \nEXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - \"THREE SPIRES RIDGE\" \nA.J. is walking along the GAPING, JAGGED FISSURE, 50 feet wide, 50 feet deep,  stretching across the entire slope. \nLev This bad, this very bad, very, very bad... \nA.J. Stick a cork in it, Lev. I'm tryin' to think. \nA.J. stares at the fissure, his eyes roaming from the fissure...to the  Armadillo...back to the fissure. \nA.J. (cont'd) Hop on the back. Get our weight distributed better. \nLev (uncertain) And why to do this? \nA.J. Because I'm askin'. And turn your suit's thrusters off. Trust me, okay? \nA.J. gets in the Armadillo. Lev goes around back, climbs on the REAR BUMPER. He  clicks off his pressure suit's pro-gravity thrusters. \nLev Okey-doke. \nThe Armadillo begins backing down the slope. \nINT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO \n"}

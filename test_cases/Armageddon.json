We're going to fly to that asteroid with a nuclear device, implant  it and get off  before it blows. Quincy? \nAll eyes turn to N.A.S.A. Chief of R&D, RONALD QUINCY. Quincy has coke bottle  glasses and a 198 I.Q. \nQuincy Look: set a fire cracker off in your open palm, you get a third degree  burn. Close your fist, It'll do some serious damage. If we can get a nuke deep  in one of the asteroid's fault lines, she'll split in two, like a diamond. \nGolden You're all looking art us like we're crazy. We're not. \nSkip Dan, our currant shuttle fleet is too old and too slow. \nGolden What I'm going to tell you is a breach of national security and could  land me in jail, but in eighteen days there arnt' gonna be any jails,  so....We're not gonna use a  current shuttle.

Right, Quince? \nQuincy Right. And the first thing I'm gonna do is talk to the guy I ripped  off. His name is Harry S. Stamper. He's the best oil driller in the world. \nGolden I don't care who he is, what he's doing. \nEXT. NORWAY COAST - NORTH SEA - \"TROLL\" OIL RIG - DAY \nSUPER -  DAY TWO \nClose on a GOLF BALL. THWACK!

Bennie examines the  rig's DOWNHOLE PRESSURE GAUGE. \nBennie Chick! take a look at this! \nChick Pressure's been up all morning. She kicked twice on me. \nA.J.'s eyes move to a TALL BLOND MAN on his lunch break across the rig. \nA.J. What did our always-at-lunch-Swedish geologist say? \nBennie Jah, jah, jah. No bleeper. Too much pressure. \nChick You askin' the old man? \nA.J. nods and walks off. \nEXT. \"TROLL\" RIG - TOP TIER \nHarry HITS another ball. WE REVEAL his target, a GREENPEACE BOAT anchored off  the rig. The BALL strikes the side of the boat, just missing the head of ONE of  the PROTESTERS. \nHarry Almost caught that little bastard. \nHe admires his shot as his daughter, GRACE, walks up. Grace is late 20's,  business dress, Harvard Law. \nGrace Having fun? \nHarry HITS another ball. It misses the boat, skips across the water. \nGrace Sure sliced the shit outta that one.

It's the damnedest thing, but this  person you...know...really well. \nACROSS THE PLATFORM - Grace escorts five angry OIL INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES over to  Harry. A KLAXON SOUNDS. Harry, alarmed, rushes right past them, toward the \"A\"  Derrick. They follow, snapping at his heels \nOil Executive 1 You explicitly promised results at 25 thousand feet. \nHarry We have results. \nOil Executive 2 But we don't have oil. We've given you everything you've  asked.... \nHarry Horseshit. What the...? Chick! Bennie! Somebody better tell me why the  hell \"A\" derrick is not turning! \nChick hurries up to Harry. \nChick The uhh....the Greenpeace guys. \nHarry approaches \"A\" Derrick. Five MEMBERS of Greenpeace have handcuffed  themselves in a circle around the drilling pipe. \nHarry Hey there, what can I do for you? \nGreenpeace Leader This is an official protest. \nHarry 'Course it is. I love you guys. You like dolphins and whales, I like 'em  too. Hey, I know you. You too. Didn't you have shorter hair? \nGreenpeace Leader Stamper, do you know what this thing does to the eco-system? \nHarry How'd you get out here? Canoe? Rowboat? Oh, that boat down there with a  thousand horsepower diesel! \nGreenpeace Leader How can you wake up every day and look at yourself in the  mirror? \nHarry The same way you did when you blow-dried your hair this morning. And you  used a curling iron, I betcha. Did you know most electricity's from burning oil?  I'' stop drillin' when the world - stops usin' it. Bennie, start 'er up! \nGreenpeace Leader Wait........ \nHarry Can't wait! I'm a businessman! Those goons over there gave me 57 mil. to  find oil and they ain't leavin' till I do! 'cause they have no lives! \nThe drill string begins to turn in the hole. \nGreenpeace Leader We....we threw away the key. \nHarry Sorry. Time is money.

{"train": "\"STILLNESS IN THE WATER\" \nAKA: \n\"JAWS\" \nby \nCarl Gottlieb \nand \nPeter Benchley \nFrom the novel \nby \nPeter Benchley \nOVER BLACK \nSounds of the innerspaces rushing forward. \nThen a splinter of blue light in the center of the picture. \nIt breaks wide, showing the top and bottom a silhouetted curtain of razor sharp teeth suggesting that we are inside of a tremendous gullet, looking out at the onrushing undersea world at night. HEAR a symphony of underwater sounds: landslide, metabolic sounds, the rare and secret noises that certain undersea species share with each other. Also, the hint of familiar music, twisted and distorted by the depths. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BEACH \u0096 NIGHT \u0096 SHARK'S POINT OF VIEW \u0096 RISING OUT OF THE WATER, LOOKING AT \nIt is a pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-June. We see a long straight stretch of white beach. Behind the low dunes are the dark shapes of large expensive houses. Hear a number of voices singing. It sounds like an eastern university's alma mater, no longer distorted. \nEXT. BEACH \u0096 NIGHT \u0096 ANOTHER ANGLE \nAround a blazing bonfire, a group of young men and women, beer cans (or maybe a keg) in evidence, as well as the bota Spanish leather wine-bag much in favor by beach and ski-bum types. \nThe group is swapping sentimental alma maters, weepily singing eastern Ivy League anthems -\u0096 Dartmouth, Cornell, Harvard, Penn, etc. Two young people break away from the others. They \nare Tom Cassidy and Chrissie. Behind them, there is considerable necking activity; Tom and Chrissie are more serious. \nTOM \nMakes a clumsy attempt at snaring Chrissie, cups her from behind. She squirms playfully out of his grasp. We discover he's not especially sober. \nTOM Hey! Hey hey! I'm with you, right? \nEXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE BEACH \u0096 NIGHT \nTom and Chrissie are separated from the others, silhouetted against the fire, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is plodding along in the sand, winded. \nChrissie runs down the slope of the dune towards the water, leaving Tom reeling atop the dune. As she runs, she is shedding her clothes. Tom is trying to trail her by her clothes, like Hansel following bread crumbs through the woods. \nBut Chrissie is way ahead of him. \nCHRISSIE C'mon! \nShe runs headlong into the inviting sea, plunges cleanly into the water with a light \"Whoops!\" as the cold water sweeps over her. \nBehind all this, we continue to hear the sentimental, beery chorus of alma maters. \nThen we see it -- a gentle bulge in the water, a ripple that passes her a dozen feet away. A pressure wave lifts her up, then eases her down again, like a smooth, sudden swell. \nCHRISSIE Tommy? Don't dunk me... \nShe looks around for him, finds him still on the beach, his feet tangled in his pants, which have dropped around his ankles. She starts to swim back in to him. \nEXT. CHRISSIE IN THE WATER \nHer expression freezes. The water-bulge is racing towards her. The first bump jolts her upright, out of the water to her hips. She reaches under water to touch her leg. Whatever she feels makes her open her mouth to scream, but she is slammed again, hard, whipped into an arc of about eight feet, up and down, submerging her down to her open mouth, choking off any scream she might try to make. Another jolt to her body, driving her under so that only her hair swirls on the surface. Then it too is sucked below in a final and terrible jerking motion. HOLD on the eddies and swirls until we're sure it's all over. \nEXT. CLOSE ON TOM ON BEACH \nIn his shorts, laughing to himself, turning in slow stoned circles, held prisoner by his windbreaker which seems to have him in an armlock, as he struggles to free his arm from a tight sleeve. As he turns, we hear the alma maters in the background, from the fire. \nINT. BRODY HOUSE - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING \nA shaft of morning sun blasts through the crack between the bottom of the shade and the windowsill, falling across the heads of the sleeping couple on the bed. It catches Martin Brody right across the eyes, bringing him up from sleep. The job is completed by the clock radio, which clicks on with local fisherman's report and weather. \nRADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Hayes Landing reports conditions good, with stripers and jacks. The Coast Guard has no storm warning from Block Island to Cape Hatteras; a light chop with freshening winds, continued clear and mild... (etc.) \nEllen Brody burrows her head under the covers, avoiding morning for a few precious minutes more. \nMichael heads toward the beach. \nBRODY (struggling to get his shirt on over his glasses) The office. \nHe gets his shirt on with Ellen's help. She flicks imaginary dust from the badge on his chest. \nELLEN Be careful. \nBRODY Here? You gotta be kiddin'. \nHe gives her a light kiss, starts to go, with his cup. \nBRODY Love ya. \nELLEN (kissing him back) Hey Chief. Bring my cup back. \nAt the door, he takes a windbreaker off a peg and goes on out. \nWe can see the Amity Police shoulder patch as he goes to a van parked outside. \nEXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - MORNING \nMartin Brody's Country Squire police wagon rushes past, taking the view to an enormous billboard depicting a typical summer day in Amity. A beautiful model splashes in the gold surf, languishing in a Solarcaine sun. AMITY WELCOMES YOU is written above her flailing arms. \nEXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY \nThree small figures in the landscape, walking the beach. The surf is rough and there is sea-floor debris strewn about from the receding tide. \nCLOSER ANGLE \nDeputy Hendricks is searching the shore about one hundred yards down wind. Meanwhile, Brody, in his casual police attire, and Tom Cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him in last night, walk down the beach. Brody fingers the missing girl's shoes, purse and clothes. In the daylight, Cassidy misconducts himself, wavering between inflated maturity and tear-blown adolescence. \nBRODY Christine what? \nCASSIDY Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before. \nBRODY You picked her up on the ferry. \nCASSIDY I didn't know her. \nBRODY And nobody else saw her in the water? \nCASSIDY Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out. \nBRODY Think she might've run out on you? \nCASSIDY Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned. \nBRODY You from around here? \nCASSIDY No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though. \nBRODY You here for the summer? \nCASSIDY Some friends and me took a house. \nBRODY (genuinely curious) What d'you pay for a place just for the summer? \nCASSIDY A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that. \nBRODY Pretty stiff. \nA shrill whistle makes them turn. Hendricks is fifty yards away, on his knees. He blows again, a feeble report this time. \nBRODY Maybe that's your girl. \nBrody runs toward Hendricks, Cassidy hesitates, then follows with: \nCASSIDY (pathetically) You can't make me look -- ! \nMASTER ANGLE - THE SAND DUNE \nA skein of seaweed garnishes the base of this isolated dune. \nThe booming waves and fizzing surf make dialogue inaudible. \nDeputy Hendricks on hands and knees, looking white as a sheet. Brody tells Cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune, and ventures up. Hendricks stops him with a wave-off, saying something at the same time. Brody nods understanding and steps up cautiously and looks down. He adjusts his glasses, trying to make sense of what he is looking at. \nWhatever he sees has a marked effect on his entire physique. \nKicking out with his foot, Brody sends dozens of angry horseshoe crabs into an escape frenzy and they boil over the top of the dune and down its slopes. \nCassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwards when Brody waves him over. He shakes his head. An awkward moment. Then Cassidy shuffles forward and up the few remaining feet, his eyes looking everywhere but down. Brody says something else and Cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sea. Brody puts his hand gently around the quaking man's shoulder. \nMAX TAFT (an adult) Looks like another big season. Gets worse every year. \nMRS. TAFT And none of them from the Island. Just a lot of bother. \nBrody (and we) hear a shrill scream from the water. He stretches to look past the group, to see what's happening out there. \nBRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER \nThe young lady is disappearing under the water, pulled under the waves by some force. She is shrieking. She pops right up again riding the shoulders of her boyfriend, who pulled her under. She's laughing hysterically. Brody is unamused. \nTHE ADULTS \nBRODY (to Taft) What? \nTAFT Present company excepted, but off- islanders are a pain in the butt. Pardon my French. \nEllen captures Sean, and holds him playfully, an example. \nELLEN What about this kid? What if he were born here. That make him an islander? \nTAFT Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an oven, it don't make them muffins. \nSEAN I'm not a muffin! I'm a boy! \nBrody rumples his hair and sets him off to play. \nANGLE ON ANOTHER SMALL BOY, PLAYING ALONE \nIt's Alex Kintner, and his mother, nearby, reading a novel. \nAlex is towing a funny rubber raft, and headed for the water. \nMRS. KINTNER Alex! Alex Kintner! Where do you think you're going? \nALEX Water. Just once more, please? \nMRS. KINTNER Let me see your fingers -- \nHe holds out his hands. \nMRS. KINTNER They're beginning to prune. 10 minutes more. \nAlex starts for the ocean. Behind him, Michael and his gang are also heading for the inviting waves. Brody is watching them go, his spine rigid with tension. \nMAN AND HIS DOG \nAs Alex and the boys hit the water, we see the man throwing his stick into the waves, his dog swimming strongly after it. \nBRODY'S POINT OF VIEW \nOut beyond the kids and the dog, the Fat Lady is bobbing around, out way too far, isolated from the other swimmers. \nUNDERWATER VIEW - EXT. - DAY \nA fish's-eye view of the bathers: lots of little kicking legs, rafts with tasty arms dangling in the blue, slowing circling, favoring one raft (little Alex's). The Kintner boy's legs and arms are kicking and paddling, producing bizarre underwater vibrations of more than passing interest. Dog goes by, dog-paddling along. \nON THE BEACH \nBrody is half-rising, looking out over the water. The Fat Lady is not where he remembered her. He scans the water anxiously. \nELLEN Do you want the boys to come in? Honey, if you're worried... \nA Black Object swims across the water. It's the dog, breasting against the surf. \nANGLE ON THE WATER - BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW \nIt's the Fat Lady, floating, relaxing. A black object swims up to her. It's not the dog. It rears up out of the water. \nIt's a man in a black bathing cap. They exchange distant pleasantries, he strokes away. \nANOTHER ANGLE - WATER \nAlex Kintner, paddling around, making boat sounds, tooting, going \"vroom, vroom.\" \nANGLE ON THE BOY AND GIRL \nThey kiss, embrace, kiss again. Strong stuff. They sink beneath the waves, knotted in an embrace. \nANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY AND HIS FRIENDS \nHe's trying to salvage a soggy piece of birthday cake, holding it above the water, paddling with his other hand. The bandage has come part way loose, and his cut is trailing in the water. \nBRODY AND ELLEN ON THE BEACH \nMEADOWS I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this. \nBRODY I'm responsible for public safety around here... \nVAUGHN Then go out tomorrow and make sure no one gets hurt. (addressing the crowd) Everybody, could I have your attention? Since this affects all of us, I suggest we move into council chambers, where there's more room... \nThere is a flurry and a bustle as everyone rearranges themselves and makes their way into the Amity Selectmen's Council Chambers. \nINT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY \nThe crowd is thronging into the large room. Already in the room is a solitary figure, standing all the way in the rear, watching everyone as they enter. Against the back wall is a large blackboard used for town business during meetings. \nVAUGHN Well, here we all are; anyone have any special questions? \nDENHERDER Is that $3000 bounty on the shark in cash or check? (laughter from all) \nVAUGHN That's private business between you brave fishermen and Mrs. Kintner. (to Brody) -- Chief -- \nBRODY (stepping in) I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police... \nMEADOWS (leading the direction of the discussion) What's going on with the beaches, Chief? \nAll react. \nBRODY I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland. \nVAUGHN (Interrupting -- sotto voice to Brody) No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin. \nWOMAN Are you going to close the beaches? \nBRODY Larry and I have also decided to close the beaches for a short time. \nPandemonium. A collective nerve has been touched. \nVAUGHN Only 24 hours! \nBRODY I didn't agree to that! \nMRS. TAFT That official business could take all summer! \nMR. KEISEL Maybe it's better to close. \nTwo opinions have been expressed, and the crowd takes sides vociferously, ad libbing assent or dissent depending on the point of view held forth. \nTHOSE IN FAVOR \nMR. WISEMAN We should make sure there is no danger. \nMR. HASSETT I didn't raise my kids to be some fish's lunch! \nTHOSE OPPOSED \nMRS. TAFT The motel is all I own -- you pull the plug on this town and I go down the drain with it. \nMR. POSNER Nobody's seen a shark. \nMR. POLK We'll lose business, we lose taxes, we lose our shirts! \nANGLE ON QUINT, THE MAN IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM \nHe has just run his large, coarse fingernails over the blackboard. He is a large, rough man, a professional fisherman marked by daily physical toil, About 45 or 50, it's hard to tell where the scars leave off and the wrinkles begin. There is a bit of the showman in him, as well as a bit of killer- whale. \nQUINT (after taking a deep breath) You all know me. You know what I do for a living. I'll go out and get this bird for you. He's a bad one and it's not like goin' down the pond chasing blue-gills and tommy- cods. This is a fish that can swallow a man whole. A little shakin', a little tenderizing and down ya' go. (a look to Vaughn) You gotta get this fellow and get him quick. If you do, it'll bring a lot of tourist business just to see him and you've got your business back on a paying basis. (beat) A shark of that size is no pleasure and I value my neck at a hell of a lot more'n 3,000 bucks. (a deadly look) I'll find him for three. But I'll kill him for ten. \nCrowd reaction. \nQUINT (he rises up) The bastard is costing you more'n that every day. Do you wanna stay alive and annee up the ten or play it cheap and be on welfare next winter. (a final moment) I'm gonna kill this thing... just a matter of whether I do it now -- or at the end of summer. \nVAUGHN Thank you very much, Mr. Quint, the Selectmen will take your offer under advisement \nINT. BRODY'S STUDY AT HOME - SUNSET \nA riffly blur, color alternating with black and white. The dizziness stops on a book page showing a black and white rendering of eight species of shark. The banner at the top of the page reads: THE KNOWN AND REPUTED MANEATERS. \nThe riffling begins again, stops on a grizzly photograph of scar tissue on six former shark victims. Riffling -- stop. \nPhotograph of five Ichthyologists posing on wooden stools, framed by the enormous jaws of a prehistoric shark from the family Carcharodon charcharias. \nBRODY \nhis reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve library books, all on the subject of sharks and shark attacks. The door opens and Ellen enters, quietly, in respect for Brody's mood. \nELLEN Can you stand something to eat? \nCLOSE - CHAIN IN WHEELBARROW \nSuddenly zipping out, faster and faster, as both men straighten. \nDenherder is goggle-eyed. \nDENHERDER Hey! What's this? \nThe chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the wheelbarrow to the end of the jetty. A section of chain tangles around the handle and flips the entire machine into the air. Both men watch dumbfounded as the inner tube, racing out to sea in a wake of white water, suddenly dips under. \nCHARLIE Look at him take it! \nDENHERDER Do I set the goddam hook? \nCHARLIE Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go! \nIt is then that the chain whips taut against the narrow pilings. \nCLOSE - PILING \nA lineup of five decrepit 2 x 4 inch pilings SNAP with a resounding CRACK. \nANGLE - JETTY \nThe end of the jetty is yanked loose. Denherder is flipped like a chip over the side and into the cold night water, where he manages to snag hold of a splintered timber. \nDENHERDER'S POINT OF VIEW \nThe severed section of jetty, a joined platform of footboards, is being dragged seaward with Charlie sitting dazed on top of it, his lit pipe still going. \nDENHERDER CHARLIE! JUMP! \nCharlie rolls into the water, sputters, turns to watch the flotilla of wood draw away. \nCLOSE - CHARLIE \nlooking seaward. \nCHARLIE'S POINT OF VIEW \nThe end of the jetty makes a 180-degree turn and heads back in his direction. \nCHARLIE Holy Jesus Christ! \nDenherder steps up on the broken-off piling just to be out of the water. \nDENHERDER Get the hell out! Charlie! Swim! \nCharlie, inhaling terror, trying to slog to shore. The jetty is getting closer. Suddenly, an enormous black fin breaks water like a periscope, making course corrections as it comes for Charlie. \nDenherder jumps from piling to piling, almost losing his balance on his way to help Charlie. Charlie has reached the last pylon toward open sea, and his hands clamber for a hold. But -- \nINSERT - CHARLIE'S HANDS \nThe algae is too slippery, and his fingers keep sliding back. \nThat's when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky and Charlie manages, with Denherder's desperate help, to make it safely to shore. The remains of the pier float belly- up in the inlet. \nCLOSE ON THE HARBORMASTER OF AMITY - DAY \nHe is sitting on a little canvas folding chair, eating a bowl of Cheerios with milk and sugar, watching a panorama of ineptitude and greed unfold before his old seaman's eyes. \nThe Amity Pier area is a minor madhouse: out-of-state cars elbow local vehicles for parking space at the foot of the dock, and a parade of bounty-hunting townspeople, islanders, off-islanders, tourist, and others shout and push their way onto the crowded pier, each carrying some bizarre or appropriate tool for the real or imagined capture of an unarmed shark of indeterminate size. \nRods and reels, drop lines, crossbows, slingshots, harpoons, shotguns, rifles, nets and tridents; every fishing supply store and sporting goods house within a hundred miles has been cannibalized to equip this weird array. \nANGLE ON BRODY AND HENDRICKS ARRIVING ON THE SCENE \nNot having room to bring their police vehicle anywhere near this mess, they are proceeding on foot into the confusion. \nHENDRICKS ...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat. \nBRODY That wasn't funny. \nSome of the locals greet Hendricks with occasional nods of recognition, or an ad libbed \"Hi, Lenny,\" or \"Hey, Lenny.\" \nHENDRICKS Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream. \nBRODY Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer. \nANGLE ON BOAT RENTAL - PIER \nAn argument is in progress between and Out-of-Towner and the Boat Rental Man. \nBrody tucks the dynamite under his arm, and continues down the pier. Hooper is still with him. \nAll around them are two distinctly different breeds; the quiet pros, like Ben Gardner, in well-worn, comfortable clothes, with efficient, sensible gear, and the amateur crazies, with all manner of weapons and impractical, silly tourist clothing. \nINT. DOCK SHED - DAY \nBrody is on the phone, talking to his office, trying to get Hendricks' attention. He throws a handful of washers at the window. \nHOOPER There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater. \nBRODY You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy. \nHOOPER Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody? \nBRODY Who are you? \nHOOPER Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. (holds out his hand) \nEXTERIOR - OCEAN - DAY \nBen Gardner's boat is in the lead with Gardner's shouting derisive comments at the crowd headed out from land. The armada is spread out and moving in a ragged circle, fifteen boats in all. One man heaves cherry bombs into the water. A smaller boat going in the opposite direction offers us Barwood, forking spaghetti leftovers into the ocean while his friend pours out a bottle of ketchup. \nA speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading instructions aloud from a book entitled \"Sharks - East Coast, Vol. I.\" \nboatload of impoverished scallop fishermen throw a net overboard, full of gaps and split ends. The professionals look professional, but the landlubbers out for the $3000 make it impossible for everybody. Collisions are barely averted. \nTHE RUBE GOLDBERG ERROR \nThe Out-of-Towner in a small boat is bent over in a life and \ndeath struggle, his rod in a tight arc. His buddy leaps across to lend a hand. \nTwenty yards away in another boat the same struggle ensues. \nThis time it's the overloaded boat with the poor scallop fishermen. Shouts of I'M ON! DIG IN! STRIKE! Then a tangle of tackle springs from the water. They have hooked each other. \nJoy turns to swearing.  Arnold Felix stands up to applaud the mishap, while his buddy Pratt takes careful aim with his Remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it were a clay pigeon.  The tangle explodes -- \nBoth the Out-of-Towners and the Scallop Fisherman falls over backward -- \nANGLE - HARRY'S BOAT \nThree men are aboard, one holding a rod which holds a fast arc. A few yards off stern we see a triangular dorsal fin crossing back and forth, struggling, jerking, the mighty tail threshing. One man is screaming success, the other two slapping the angler on the back. \nCLOSE - PRATT AND FELIX \nThey spot it and sour. \nPRATT Well, get over there! He ain't caught it yet! \nThe owner of Pratt's boat throws it forward and Pratt removes a .45 automatic from the holster of his belt. He tests it, firing once in the air. As they near the scene of the struggle, eleven other boats begin converging, until -- \nHARRY'S BOAT \nEveryone wants to get into the act. They are attacking the \nthreshing beast with all they've got. Pratt uses his automatic, another blasts point blank with a shotgun. There are occasional water ricochets and the bounty hunters duck from time to time as bullets skip by. Finally, the shark stops threshing. \nFELIX AND PRATT \nTheir boat has moved close to the shark, closer than Harry's. \nPRATT (exultant) Hand me that pole! Quick! \nOne of his party in the over-filled boat grabs a gaff and leans out to grab the moribund shark. But Harry won't give up the line, still reeling in. \nHARRY Beat it! I hooked him! \nPRATT How's the family, Harry? (to the man with gaff) Go on and do it! \nMAN WITH GAFF We split down the middle? \nPratt nods reluctantly. The man swings, lodges the gaff and hauls the shark up onto the gunwale. A paroxysm of cheers from the surrounding boats. Smoke flares are fired into the air. \nHARRY (a tug-of-war) Let go my shark! \nIt is a ten-foot tiger, and what a mess -- splattered with bullet punctures, gashes, bleeding from several orifices. But it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to capsize the boat. Pratt panics and fires six times with his .45. The bullets pierce the shark's head, pass through, and split the fiberglass hull through which a flood of water rises. Everybody stands up as the boat slips beneath them. \nINT. MORGUE - DAY \nThe Amity Morgue is also the Amity Funeral Home, a Victorian house that normally serves as the community's mortuary. The Coroner, a professional small-town GP, is standing by as Hooper is speaking into a sophisticated cassette recorder with a headpiece that leaves his hands free for measurement with a calibrator or calipers. \nBRODY Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident. \nHOOPER There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside. \nVAUGHN That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater! \nHOOPER Let's just cut him open and see what's inside... \nBRODY Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way. \nVAUGHN Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben... (to Meadows) do you have all the pictures you need? \nMEADOWS Plenty. \nHOOPER Wait a minute... \nFelix, Pratt and the others ad lib disagreement. \"You're not gonna cut up my trophy,\" etc. \nVAUGHN (seeing something offstage, with low intensity) I am not going to stand here and watch this fish cut open and see some kid fall out on the dock. Besides... (he indicates off) \nWe see Mrs. Kintner approaching, dressed in black. \nVAUGHN (to Brody) Chief, I'll take responsibility for this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch down before he stinks up the whole island. Harve, tomorrow you and Carl take him out and dump him right in the drink. \nMRS. KINTNER JOINS THE GROUP \nShe seeks out Brody, and stops in front of him. \nMRS. KINTNER Chief Brody? \nHe nods, she slaps him full across the face. There is an embarrassed silence. Some people leave, following a trend that began with the first mention of cutting open the shark. \nMRS. KINTNER My Alex was a beautiful little boy and you killed him. Did you know that? You knew there was a shark out there. You knew a girl got killed here last week. I just found that out. But you knew. You knew it was dangerous, but you let people go swimming anyway. You knew all those things, and still my boy is dead now and there's nothing you can do about that. My boy is dead. I wanted you to know that. \nShe stops, unable to continue. Her father takes her arm and leads her away. Pratt, Harry and the others trail off after her. During the rest of the scene, the camera tightens in on Brody to the exclusion of the others. \nVAUGHN I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state. \nHOOPER Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure... \nBefore Hooper can finish, Brody's shoulders slump and he goes slack. \nBRODY (almost to himself) She's right. \nVAUGHN Let's all get out of here, this place stinks. \nBRODY I'm going home. \nHe turns and leaves abruptly, surrendering the dock to Vaughn and Hooper, who eye each other with mutual dis-admiration. \nINT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT - DINING ROOM \nBrody and Ellen, Sean and Michael, have all finished dinner. \nBrody's plate is untouched, a virgin meatloaf. His glass, on the other hand, is well used, with the remnants of a stiff scotch and ice. He is staring across the table at the youngest, Sean, who makes a face at him. He makes a face back. \nThey play this game together for a few minutes. \nBRODY C'mere and give Daddy a kiss. \nSEAN Why? \nBRODY Because he needs it. \nSean gives Daddy the kiss. Brody shoos him and Michael off to bed. Ellen, who is feeling progressively more left out with each passing moment, gets up abruptly and clears a few dishes. Brody is not letting her into his world for the moment, and it shows. There's a knock at the door. \nHOOPER (O.S.) Martin Brody residence? \nEllen opens the door for him. \nHOOPER Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him. \nELLEN So would I. Come on in. \nHooper enters. He's carrying a couple of bottles of wine which he picked up in town. He sits down near Brody. \nELLEN Would you like something? Some coffee? \nHOOPER (seeing Brody's plate) Is anyone having this...? \nHe starts in on it, as soon as someone has indicated \"go ahead.\" \nHOOPER Dynamite! (to Brody) How was your day...? \nBRODY Swell. \nBRODY Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not. \nELLEN Can you do that? \nBRODY I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want. (to Hooper) You want to come? \nHOOPER I'm flattered you should ask. \nHe gets up and they both start out. Ellen watches them go. \nINT. BOAT SHED - NIGHT \nDark, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange silhouettes of boat parts and scaffolding. At one end, the large, symmetrical bulk of the shark's carcass lies on a tarp. A single dark figure is bending over the dead shark. \nThe large double doors at one end of the shed squeak open, and the Shadowy Figure moves abruptly away from the shark. \nThe new entrants move into the shed. It is Hooper and Brody and they are continuing the conversation begun in the car on the way over. \nAs the Shadowy Figure moves silently into a vantage point against one wall, he passes through the light from a window; it is Quint, and we only see him long enough to recognize him as he backs against the wall. \nHOOPER ...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence. \nBRODY What stinks so bad? \nHOOPER Our friend, the shark. \nThey bend over the shape like 18th century graverobbers. \nHOOPER We always had a summer place on the water -- Newport, the Vineyard, so I figured I'd major in something I knew about. Oceanography, marine biology. It was that, or design racing yachts like my older brother. Hmmm. He we go. Up the old alimentary canal. Hold the light. \nWe hear a slurp and a squish as Hooper produces a big knife and dips into the shark with a major incision. \nHOOPER We open the abdominal cavity and check the digestive tract. Simple. (he attends to his work) \nFrom his vantage point, Quint watches, unseen by the two men. \nBrody is holding the light, fighting the gag reflex, fascinated by the bizarre ritual. \nBRODY What's that? \nHOOPER Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha! \nBRODY What? What?! \nHOOPER Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters. \nBRODY How can you tell? \nHOOPER (showing it) Florida license plate. \nBRODY He ate a car? \nHOOPER (laughs) No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here... \nHe kicks the remains around below camera. \nHOOPER ...Nothing. \nBRODY What do we do? \nHOOPER If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him. \nBRODY Chum? \nHOOPER Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him. (checks his watch) It's a good time, too. They're night feeders... \nEXT. ABOARD HOOPER'S BOAT - NIGHT (TANK) \nWe see Brody, looking sick and nervous, holding on anxiously as the \"Fascinatin' Rhythm\" moves slowly ahead trolling at night. His glasses are already flecked with the white salt of dried seawater. He is wearing a life-preserver. \nHooper is at the wheel, a chart spread in front of him, his eyes scanning the sea restlessly, checking the dials and gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth-finding and \"fish-finder\" gear mounted in the cockpit. A green glow shines from the instruments on his face. Two closed-circuit TV cameras mounted below the hull flash their pictures onto monitors in the dash. \nIn the aisle between the seats is a large container filled with unpleasant-looking bait; Hooper is long-lining for signs of shark, and chumming. \nHOOPER (indicating distant flashing beacon) That's the Cape Light -- we're on the stretch where he's feeding, if he's still here. \nBrody, bored, tired, and slightly queasy, is trying to concentrate on anything but the motion of the boat. He stares at the sophisticated electronics displays. \nBRODY What is all this stuff? \nHOOPER (ticking them off) Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band... (points to themselves) And two loose nuts behind the wheel. \nBRODY Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around? \nHooper takes a last few breaths, orients himself, takes a long, hard look at the quiet, open ocean, and falls into the sea. \nCLOSE ON BRODY \nHe is studying the surface, trying to follow Hooper's movements. Brody is forcing himself to stay at the edge of the boat by sheer willpower and grim determination. Brody is fascinated by the sea like a bird facing a cobra. He is very much alone. He grasps a flashlight or boathook as a fragile defense against the unknown. \nPAST BRODY'S BACK TO THE ELECTRONICS \nBeep, chatter, blip. \nUNDERWATER SEQUENCE - HOOPER \nHooper descends in a froth of bubbles. Warily he turns a full circle with his hotlight. At first we see nothing out of place about the Flicka except that it is lying so low in the water. But as Hooper travels the bottom looking for damage, he comes across a jagged hole two-thirds of the way forward. \nThe hole is about the size of a basketball, and the wood around it has been bashed and splintered. Hooper explores the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from its sheath and begins to dig at something. Whatever it is comes free in his hand. As he studies his find, his light wanders upward, pointing directly into the dark hole. Hooper looks up... \nCLOSE - HOLE \nBen Gardner's dead face stares out through the hole in the Flicka, eyes and mouth gaping in frozen horror, his skin pinched like a prune. \nCLOSE - HOOPER \nbumps his head in trying to get away, seems to yell through escaping bubbles. We hear the gasping shout as a bubbling roar in the ears. His mask fills with water as he flails for the surface. Miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of his own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with adrenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pried loose from the hull drifts down and out, falling into the eternity of the ocean bottom. He finally bursts through the surface. \nEND OF UNDERWATER SEQUENCE \nTHE BOAT, HOOPER EMERGING FROM THE WATER \nHe is gasping for breath, his whole body vibrating with urgency. The salt water in his lungs combines with the adrenaline in his blood to deprive him of speech. \nBRODY You all right? \nHOOPER A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate... \nBRODY No shark did that to a boat! \nHooper, despite his shock and surprise, is strangely elated, almost giddy with the wonder of his discovery. \nHOOPER Jesus Christ! A Great White! Who'd believe it! We're not talking about a shark, we're talking about a Shark! \nBrody sinks weakly into a chair. Brody huddles in the stern, Hooper kicks the engine in with a roar, and still a-shiver with excitement, turns the boat and its grim tow back to port. \nEXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - THE BILLBOARD - DAY \nNext to the \"Amity Welcomes You\" billboard is a group of selectmen, Vaughn, Meadows, Hendricks, and another deputy standing by with paint and brushes. Brody's wagon is there, along with a few other cars. Busy late afternoon traffic is starting to pile up as early weekenders and curiosity seekers slow down to see what's happening. \nBehind the billboard, Brody and Hooper have gotten Vaughn to one side. They are making a closely reasoned presentation to him. \nBRODY There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater. \nHOOPER You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water. \nBRODY There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island. \nHOOPER A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it! \nBRODY A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake! \nHOOPER I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there. \nBRODY We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up. \nVAUGHN Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it? \nHOOPER I don't have it. \nBRODY He lost it on the way up. \nVAUGHN What kind of a shark did you say it was? \nHOOPER Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White. \nVAUGHN Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished. \nBRODY We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have. \nVAUGHN I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems... \nHOOPER I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply... \nBRODY That means closing the beaches. \nVAUGHN Come here, I want to show you something. \nBrody and Hooper, badly in need of sleep, are watching the crew straggle in. Already the first of the holiday beach- goers are piling out of their cars in a brightly colored cascade of beach balls, umbrellas, blankets, portable bar-b- ques, radios, sun visors, reflectors, rafts, balls, tubes, and newspapers. \nHooper watches one such group: A Family of Ten getting out of a camper-van. He watches in dismay as the family bumbles onto the beach for a day of fun in the sun. \nBrody addresses his troops, such as they are. \nBRODY I want to thank you guys from local agencies for cooperating, and I hope we won't actually be needing your services. But I'm glad to have you here. \nThe Men ad lib responses: \"Happy to do it,\" \"Any time,\" \"When's lunch?\" \"I hate holidays,\" etc. \nENSIGN I want to get our lines and repellent out, so we better shove off. \nHe nods to his men, who head for some Boston Whalers (or similar boat with surf-riding capability) and push off into the surf to patrol the swimming areas. \nBRODY (a last caution) We're all on one channel, so let's keep radio traffic to a minimum, okay? \nEveryone kind of nods acknowledgment. \nHOOPER I hope we get some more help. \nBRODY I wish it would rain... \nEXT. BEACH - AMUSEMENT AREA - CLOSE OF SHARK MACHINE \nIn a shed near the bandstand, a half-dozen pinball and arcade machines sucking quarters from holiday beach-goers. A mechanical shark traverses the screen, is hit with an electric harpoon and red \"blood\" blossoms from its side, indicating a hit. \nSounds of electronic gadgetry, people having fun. Meadows is there writing it all up for the paper. A move away from the screen of this particular machine reveals the arcade, the parking lot, and, finally, the beginnings of the panorama of the beach that July 4th has created. \nEXT. SOUTH BEACH - THE FOURTH OF JULY \nfour foot surfer's swell curls and crashes on shore, riderless. The broad sandy beach is a mosaic of summer color as one thousand vacationers practice fun in the sun, but not in the water. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors are everywhere. \nANGLE - LIFEGUARD STATIONS \nA half-dozen lookout lofts. As many handsome lifeguards with Walkie-Talkies strapped to their trunks and loud-hailers at arm's reach. Bored, two of the hot dogs train their binoculars on some local color. \nANGLE ON TV MOBILE UNIT \nA TV Mobile Unit Van is setting up: cables snaking to cameras, a camera with a big sports zoom sitting on the platform atop the truck, a spiffy announcer-type in a blazer with his station's call letters on the pocket. Inside the darkened control room, we can see the pale blue squares of monitors in a mosaic against one wall, facing the switcher. \nAT SEA \nHooper is methodically patrolling in his boat. Tactically flanking a three-hundred-yard apron of black repellent are four small watch-boats. A tiny pleasure boat darts around the repellent line. Farther out, crossing back and forth, are patrol boats. To top it all off, a Coast Guard helicopter hovers and patrols three hundred feet above. \nINT. TELEVISION MOBILE UNIT \nAt least eight monitors, reflecting the outputs of three cameras and two tape machines, as well as line, preview, and effects monitors. \nMONITOR: CAMERA 1: Holding on a group of happy citizen-bathers as they unpack their gear, wave to camera, run into the water. \nMONITOR: CAMERA 2: The Repellent Line, set in place by Coast Guardsmen in small boats, setting out floats, dumping repellent into the ocean. \nMONITOR: CAMERA 3: Close on the Bandstand, where Amity's band is playing lilting patriotic airs. \nAfter we've seen this activity, we can take a look at what's going on: the preparation of the tape segment for the six o'clock news. \nTV DIRECTOR Put 1 on the line. In five. 4. 3. 2. 1. Roll. \nOn the \"Tape 1\" and \"Line\" monitors, we see Vaughn being interviewed by the Announcer in the blazer. \nANNOUNCER ...and with me is the Mayor of Amity, Lawrence Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, how about those rumors? \nVAUGHN How about them indeed. I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have, in fact, caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers here. As you can see, it's a beautiful day, the beaches are open, and the folks here are having a wonderful time. Amity, y'know, means 'Friendship.' \nMONITOR: CAMERA 1: As Vaughn speaks to us on the monitors, the monitor for Camera 1 pans over to show a Sightseeing Bus pull up in the parking area, and a horde of media vultures spilling out, carrying cameras with long lenses and tripods, telescopes, sunshades and parasols, all the equipment of the curious and none of the equipment of the holiday bather or swimmer. \nTAPE 1 AND LINE MONITORS: Close on the Announcer, Vaughn out of the picture. \nANNOUNCER Also here today is a Marine Biologist and Research Fellow from the Oceanographic Institute, Matthew Hooper. Mr. Hooper, what've you heard? \nHOOPER What I've heard and what I've seen are two different things. I believe there is a large Great White Shark -- Carcharodon Cacharias - in the waters off this very beach, that he has killed and that he will kill again... \nHooper's voice fades off as someone at the mixer panel dials his mike off, and brings up the Announcer's lavalier. \nANNOUNCER (moving into center frame) And there you have it -- two different opinions, by men of good will. The holiday crowd here at Amity seems to be making up its own mind... \nThe camera pans off him to a happy family headed for the beach. \nMONITOR: CAMERA 3: Zooms in on the puffing face of the tuba player. \nMONITOR: CAMERA 2: Brody and the Announcer. \nMONITOR: TAPE 1 and LINE: Back on the Announcer, his lips moving, but his sound turned off. We hear, instead, the sound from Monitor Camera 2, Brody and the same Announcer. \nINT. HELICOPTER - AERIAL VIEW \nA breathtaking view. The copter spotter looks down with naked eye and binoculars. \nCOPTER SPOTTER Nothing from up here, Daisy. Over. \nCLOSE - HENDRICKS \nHENDRICKS (into walkie-talkie) False alarm. Must be this glare. \nANGLE - BEACH - CLOSE ON BRODY \nHe is walking down the beach, threading his way through the happy hordes. Meadows nods \"hello.\" \nVOICES Who's scared to go in! I was in! Up to your knees, yeah -- So come with me -- I'll go again. \nMEADOWS Beautiful day, Chief! \nA group of youngsters playing with Michael Brody's dinghy. \nThey are hauling it toward the surf. \nBRODY Hey Mikey -- ! \nMichael turns as Brody trots toward him. \nBRODY You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son? \nMICHAEL I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it. \nBRODY Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds. \nMICHAEL Dad, the ponds are for old ladies. \nBRODY Just a favor for your old man. \nMICHAEL (confused) Sure, Dad. \nTV CREW - NEAR WATER \nTV cameramen are packing up their gear. For them it's a wrap \nREPELLENT LINE - COUNTY POLICEMAN \nSuddenly his Walkie-Talkie fizzes, and the Copter Spotter's voice overloads the speaker. \nCOPTER SPOTTER Copter to Daisy! Red Four, Red Four! \nBOAT #7 - HENDRICKS \nGuns are up, heads turning everywhere. \nHENDRICKS (into walkie-talkie) Where -- ? \nCOPTER SPOTTER Went under your -- There! \nThe Coast Guard sonar operator spots it and pales. A slick black dorsal fin is slicing a wake toward the swimming area. \nSONAR OPERATOR Jesus Christ -- Shark! \nBEACH - BRODY \nRigid and choked, he almost breaks the \"send\" button trying to transmit. \nBRODY Everybody out! Out of the water, please -- leave the water, please -- \nA lifeguard in a loft behind him begins blowing on his whistle. \nCLOSE - BRODY \nshouting hysterically. \nBRODY No whistles! No whistles! \nTHE BEACH \nDozens of bathers halfway out of the water, turn to see. More whistles, and they start toward shore. We hear panicky voices ad-libbing; \"Shark,\" \"Look Out,\" etc. The loudhailers sounding more urgent now, and a contagious dread seizes one person after another. Entire groups of people begin pulling toward shore, some of them obviously trying to control a growing hysteria in others. \nBOATS #6 AND #7 \nare converging, heading toward the repellent line as if tracking an underwater shadow. The fin is beyond the repellent cordons and heading into the crowds. \nHOOPER'S BOAT \nMichael is tacking full-sail in his boat with a friend, Kit. \nKit is admiring the shark's tooth necklace around his own neck while Michael rubs some water on the scratches left by it. \nThe fin, huge, black and real, crosses behind them. They are not yet aware. The fin seems to circle and return. It heads toward Michael's boat when another small dinghy gets in its way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thermos of coffee when he is \"bumped.\" The entire boat is overturned. Michael sees the fin now as it collides with him, the entire bow lifting out of the water and rolling over on the port side. \nMichael and Kit are thrown head first. \nThree heads in the water come up sputtering, the fin between them crossing back. Michael freezes. The fin comes directly at him, growing into the sky, passing him so close he could touch it, but ignoring him as it follows the flailing and panicked weekend novice. Catches him. Michael watches. That all too familiar explosion of water -- a choked off scream -- the head and upper torso of the novice passing Michael swiftly as though being carried off -- a current of blood trailing behind. \nTHE VICTIM (passing a horrified Michael, who half extends one hand, as if to help) It's no good. I'm dead... (and he is) \nA renewed cry of shark! \nCLOSE - BRODY \nHe turns. Oh God! Running through the slogging sand. \nCLOSE - ELLEN \nA sudden turn. She runs. \nCLOSE - HOOPER IN BOAT \nHe's got the walkie-talkie to his mouth. \nHOOPER Block the estuary! The estuary! \nThree boats racing to carry out the orders. The black fin re- passing the two children, racing to get out. Hooper reaches the mouth before the others. The fin won't veer off. It smacks into the little vessel, bumping it aside. The fin is left racing into open water. Blood leavings. Hooper leaping over the side, slogging towards Michael. \nWIDE ON WATER \nCopter roars in buzzing the shark, but too late. \nCLOSE - BRODY AND ELLEN \nThey are pulling Michael out of the water as Hooper splashes up. Michael is conscious but in shock -- his eyes staring at nothing. \nBRODY (feeling his face) He's in shock. Get blankets! \nPeople gather and Brody snatches beach towels out of their hands. They cover Michael and carry him off the beach, feet raised above his head. \nINT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nMichael is wheeled out in the bed. Brody and Ellen are there. \nSean is sleepy in Brody's arms. Vaughn is waiting in the hall. \nNURSE The doctor said it's okay -- mild shock. He can come home in the morning. \nELLEN (to Michael) Hey, big guy -- you want anything from home? \nMICHAEL My cars. And a comic book. \nBRODY (sees Vaughn) Here -- (gives baby to Ellen) Take him home. \nELLEN Home... New York? \nBRODY No. Home here. \nEllen exits. \nBRODY (crossing to Vaughn) Got a pen on you? \nVAUGHN Why? \nBRODY There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor. \nVAUGHN I don't know if I can do that without a... \nBRODY (interrupting) I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead. \nVAUGHN Maybe we can save August... \nBRODY Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that? \nVAUGHN I was acting in the town's best interests... \nBRODY The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me. (indicates paper) Right there. Whatever it costs. \nVAUGHN My kids were on that beach... \nBRODY Just sign it, Larry. \nQUINT Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it. \nBRODY Who's driving the boat? \nQUINT Nobody. We're drifting with the current. \nHOOPER (using the fish finder) Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. \nQUINT (to Hooper) Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing... \nQuint opens a can of beer and drains it in one long pull, crushing the empty and throwing it over the side. Hooper drains his coffee from a styrofoam cup, and cracks it in his hand with a silly \"plup.\" He stows the pieces in an empty chum barrel. \nQUINT (to Brody) Get a fresh barrel. \nBrody goes to unlash a fresh barrel, but can't figure out the knots. He finally tugs on a piece of rope, and it all comes loose... barrel, shark cage, and, most important, Hooper's tanks, clattering and rolling on the deck. \nHOOPER (jumping up) Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh? \nQUINT (mutters) Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too. (to Brody) Next time, ask me. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLATER \nThe men are in different positions on the boat. Hooper on the flying bridge. Quint in the stern, Brody hanging over the rail, puking. \nQuint takes a wide red strip of whale meat and a gnarled squid from the garbage pail, and searches for a No. 2 hook rig. He holds up a strip of whale. \nHOOPER (eyeing bait) That's pilot whale, isn't it? \nQUINT It ain't a Big Mac. (to Brody) The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. (laughs) \nBrody shades his eyes from the white sun as Quint baits up. \nBRODY (croaky) Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there? \nQUINT (snapping bait to his leader) ...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do. \nHOOPER (to himself) Easy for you -- they got a brain the size of a radish. \nQuint sits in the fighting chair. He casts off, murmuring as the line feeds out. \nQUINT (to Brody) Now if he weren't around, we'd of hooked something else by now, wouldn't we? But he scared 'em all away. Big lonesome son of a bitch... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLATER \nQuint at ease in his chair, Brody near him, practicing tying knots. The line starts to move, a few feet at a time; both men watch. Then the line whizzes off the reel. Brody jumps up. Hooper springs to the deck. Quint puts his hand on the drag and addresses the situation softly. \nQUINT -- he'll gulp it down now... (making gulping noises) Hooooooo! \nQuint tightens drag and strikes. The line goes whizzing out. \nBrody runs to Quint's side. Hooper springs up to the flying bridge. \nBRODY You got it? \nQUINT (turning with the pull) Get behind me, dummy! (shouts to Hooper) Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line! (to Brody) Wet my reel, quick! \nBrody goes to get water, the boat surges, he staggers. Brody pours water on the screaming reel, nearly unspooled now. \nHooper is turning the boat around and the line changes direction. \nQUINT (straining, muscles popping) Starboard, for Chris'sake -- \nHooper steers it sharply. \nQUINT (to Hooper) Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there... \nHOOPER (almost to himself) Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy. \nAgain the line changes direction, down this time. \nQUINT (to Hooper) Neutral! (to himself) Where the hell is he going? \nQuint reeling in like mad. \nQUINT Oh, this ain't foolin' me -- (rod arcs down with a surge) Sure -- try it! \nHe ad libs brief instructions to Brody as the line rushes out and there is less tension. Quint is horsing up and down, reeling in. \nQUINT Makin' believe it's easy now. \nHOOPER 20 feet, if it's an inch... \nQUINT 25 feet. And three tons of him there. \nHooper is nearly beside himself with a strange ecstasy. He leaps toward his gear. \nQUINT (quietly, to Brody) I never saw one that big. \nBRODY What do we do? Get some help? Radio in? \nQuint ignores him and moves off into the pilot house, where he swiftly takes out his green case, and opens it to begin to assemble something inside it. Brody is alone on the deck with Hooper. \nBRODY How're we gonna handle this? \nHooper is contained in his own excitement. He has finally come up with what he was looking for -- an expensive Nikon through which he peers intently at the shark alongside. He is talking half to himself as he fine-tunes the range finder and focus. \nHe is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppressed emotional boil. \nHOOPER (very, very high) There's a formula! Girth, about 150 inches, squared, divide by 800 -- son of a bitch, they are not going to believe this! -- divide by 2000... three tons! (after Quint) You're right, you old fart! Three tons! (ad libs ecstasy) \nCLOSE ON QUINT IN THE PILOT HOUSE \nHe is assembling the Greener harpoon gun, deftly screwing on the long wooden stock, the heavy steel barrel, and big shaft with the wicked barbs, the frame all rigged with line. Past him, on the deck, we can still see Hooper. As Quint is working with the gun, the radio suddenly squawks into life. \nRADIO VOICE (V.O.) Amity Point Light Station to Orca. This is Amity Point Light Station, to Orca... \nQuint snaps the mouthpiece to his lips. \nQUINT Orca here. \nRADIO VOICE (V.O.) I have Mrs. Martin Brody here... \nQUINT Put her on. \nELLEN'S VOICE ...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin? \nQUINT This is Quint, Missus. \nELLEN'S VOICE I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there? \nQUINT He's busy. \nELLEN'S VOICE Well... is everything all right? \nQUINT Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out. \nHe snaps off the radio, and, for good measure, pulls the plug from the power source. \nANGLE FROM DECK \nThe big shark is slicing through the water just below the surface, its fin high, the big gray back glistening, the teeth gleaming. \nANGLE - INCLUDING FOREDECK \nHOOPER (on deck) Damn it! I need something in the foreground to give it some scale. Martin! Stand here! No, to your left! \nHe is positioning Martin frantically, trying to include Brody, the shark, and the Orca in the same frame. Quint finishes with the gun, and as a final gesture, snaps an explosive cartridge into the breech. He empties the box of cartridges onto the table, snatches up a big handful, and drops them into a pocket, and heads out on deck, bound for the bow pulpit. \nON DECK \nQuint appears with the harpoon gun. He throws one end of the line to Hooper. \nQUINT Here. Rig this to the forward keg up there. \nHe indicates the barrels on the foredeck. \nQUINT (to Brody) Get up there and steer her. Follow my hand, and hold 'er steady. I've got to get a clean shot at that porker's head. \nQuint moves up toward the bow, Brody goes up to the flying bridge to take the wheel, Hooper starts for the foredeck, but stops to rummage in his kit, throwing gear around as he desperately hunts for something. \nQUINT Hurry up, rig the line! \nANGLE ON HOOPER \nHe finds what he's looking for. A small, powerful strobe unit, waterproofed, a miniature signal beacon. He triggers it, and it begins to pulse with a light we can see even in the sun. \nHooper scampers to the foredeck and begins to rig the light to the first barrel, as the shark begins to surface near the bow. \nQUINT (to Brody) Come to port. Watch my hand. Steady now... \nHe guides Brody with hand signals. Brody tries urgently to get it right, not to oversteer, to try to hold the big boat with its throbbing diesels on the course that Quint is indicating. \nQUINT The line, man, the line! \nQuint is amused. He presents his own formidable forearm. \nQUINT Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off. \nHOOPER (rolling up a sleeve) Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit. \nBrody is fascinated. Quint and Hooper take a long pull from the bottle. \nQUINT Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here... (he bends an ear forward) ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas. \nHOOPER Ever see one like this? \nHe hauls up his pants leg, revealing a wicked white scar. \nHOOPER Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples... \nQUINT Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here -- \nHe starts rolling up his own dirty pants leg. \nQUINT Slammed with a thresher's tail. Look just like somebody caressed me with a nutmeg grater... \nBrody is drawn into their boasting comparisons. He secretly checks his own appendix scar, decides not to enter the contest. \nHOOPER I'll drink to your leg. \nQUINT And I'll drink to yours. \nThey toast each other. Brody looks around, sees the strobe blink once through the darkened window. \nQUINT Wait a minute, young fella. Look. Just look. Don't touch... \nHe starts lowering his pants to reveal a place on one hip where the tissue is scarred and irregular. \nQUINT ...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last. \nHOOPER (considerably drunker) I think I can top that, Mister... \nHooper is pulling at his shirt, trying to get it off, but it's tangling its sleeves, and won't come undone. \nHOOPER Gimme a hand, here. I got something to show you -- \nBrody lends a hand. The shirt slips part way off. \nHOOPER (indicating his chest) There. Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit broke my heart. Let's drink to Mary Ellen. \nThe two men raise their mugs in a toast. \nQUINT And here's to the ladies. And here's to their sisters; I'd rather one Miss than a shipload of Misters. \nHe drinks, Hooper follows. \nQUINT (shows belly) Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima. \nBRODY (aside) C'mon. Middle appendix -- \nQUINT (aside) I almost had 'im. \nBrody is looking at a small white patch on Quint's other forearm. \nBRODY (pointing) What's that one, there? \nQUINT (changing) Tattoo. Had it taken off. \nHOOPER Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what? \nQUINT 'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944. \nBRODY What's that, a ship? \nHOOPER (incredulous) You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus... \nQuint remembering. \nCLOSE ON QUINT \nQUINT Yeah. The U.S.S. Indianapolis. June 29th, 1945, three and a half minutes past midnight, two torpedoes from a Japanese submarine slammed into our side. Two or three. We was still under sealed orders after deliverin' the bomb...the Hiroshima bomb...we was goin' back across the Pacific from Tinian to Leyte. Damn near eleven hundred men went over the side. The life boats was lashed down so tight to make the bomb run we couldn't cut a single one adrift. Not one. And there was no rafts. None. That vessel sank in twelve minutes. Yes, that's all she took. We didn't see the first shark till we'd been in the water about an hour. A thirteen-footer near enough. A blue. You measure that by judgin' the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't know... of course the Captain knew...I guess some officers knew... was the bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signals was sent. What the men didn't know was that they wouldn't even list us as overdue for a week. Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't an officer -- just as well perhaps. So some of us were dead already -- in the water -- just hangin' limp in our lifejackets. And several already bleedin'. And the three hundred or so laying on the bottom of the ocean. As the light went, the sharks came crusin'. We formed tight groups -- somewhat like squares in an old battle -- You know what I mean -- so that when one come close, the man nearest would yell and shout and pound the water and sometimes it worked and the fish turned away, but other times that shark would seem to look right at a man -- right into his eyes -- and in spite of all shoutin' and poundin' you'd hear that terrible high screamin' and the ocean would go red, then churn up as they ripped him.  Then we'd reform our little squares. By the first dawn the sharks had taken more than a hundred. Hard for me to count but more than a hundred. I don't know how many sharks. Maybe a thousand. I do know they averaged six men an hour. All kinds -- blues, makos, tigers. All kinds. (Pause) In the middle of the second day, some of us started to go crazy from the thirst. One fella cried out he saw a river, another claimed he saw a waterfall, some started to drink the ocean and choked on it, and some left our little groups -- our little squares -- and swam off alone lookin' for islands and the sharks always took them right away. It was mainly the young fellas that did that -- the older ones stayed where they was. That second day -- my life jacket rubbed me raw and that was more blood in the water. Oh my. On Thursday morning I bumped up against a friend of mine -- Herbie Robinson from Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it seemed he was asleep but when I reached over to waken him, he bobbed in the water and I saw his body upend because he'd been bitten in half beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it went on -- bombers high overhead but nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides, sharks, and all this goin' crazy and dyin' of thirst. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura swung around and came in low. Yes. He did that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And early evenin', a big fat PBY come down out of the sky and began the pickup.  That was when I was most frightened of all -- while I was waitin' for my turn. Just two and a half hours short of five days and five nights when they got to me and took me up. Eleven hundred of us went into that ocean -- three hundred and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen hundred and forty five. June the 29th. (pause) Anyway, we delivered the bomb. \nEXT. OCEAN - NIGHT \nQuint has just finished his story, and we are looking across the quiet night sea to the Orca slowly circling in the night, the warm light in the pilot house barely revealing the figures of the three men inside, the red and green running lights winking along the ship's flanks. We hear the distant boom and drawn-out hoot of a whale. \nINT. ORCA PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe barrel is surfaced directly ahead of them, just off the port side. They are drifting up to it. \nBRODY The barrel! \nThe strobe light winks at them. Quint holds up a hand: \"Quiet!\" \nEverything stops as they watch the barrel coming slowly up on them. \nQUINT It's him. \nHe takes a killing lance from the rack. Hooper gets a boathook. \nQUINT He's under the keg. Careful -- \nHooper leans out gingerly, snagging the barrel with the hook. \nIt bobs lightly in the water, an innocent bystander. Hooper shifts his pole, takes hold of the rope, poling it in. \nQUINT (suspicious) Easy -- just want to goose him up. The minute he runs, drop it or you'll lose your hands. \nHooper gets the line and starts hauling it up. No resistance. \nIt comes easily over the transom into a coil on the deck. He and Quint exchange looks. \nQUINT Here -- gimme. I don't see what he's been doin'. \nWATER - ANGLE \nBoth men are draped over the side, their chins almost touching the water on the aft side. From the opposite starboard direction, fully unfastened from the barrel, comes the Great White. First the fin, then the conical nose and the upper border of wide, grinning teeth. It knifes through the water in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed toward the unsuspecting men. \nCLOSE - BRODY \nHis instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquired sense of direction. \nBRODY (top of his lungs) Shark! Starboard! \nCLOSE - HOOPER AND QUINT \nThey turn just in time, and a long spine-stretch saves them from instant decapitation. The Great White passes the transom, the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed- off cable. It rolls on its side and looks at them as it passes. \nPast the stern the huge tail lashes out, ripping the rope out of Quint's hands, shearing a huge swath through the paint, peeling it off like a plane, taking one of the bronze letters out of \"Orca.\" The shark begins an arc to sea, its fin cutting the water, and starts circling the boat. Quint notices his cut hand, palm bleeding, realizing how close he came to losing it. \nQUINT (to Hooper) Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us! (then to Brody on the bridge) Start the engine! \nThe diesels start with a terrible grinding. \nQUINT Easy! It'll tear right out! \nHOOPER (hauling) The shaft is giving. \nHooper slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, clearing the deck for action once again. \nBRODY (on bridge) That's it! Radio in for help! \nQUINT Shut up! Just pump her out! \nBRODY (coming down off the bridge) Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call. \nBrody heads for the radio in the pilot house. \nQUINT - CLOSE \nA perfectly terrible look comes over him. He raises up and starts after Brody. Brody disappears into the cabin. Quint pauses outside and sees: \nINSERT - QUINT'S LEAD-CENTERED BASEBALL BAT \nhis calloused hand grabs it up fiercely. \nINT. RADIO SHACK \nBrody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on the complex console. \nQUINT (O.S.) Beg your pardon -- \nANGLE - DOORWAY \nQuint appears, silhouetted in the hot light of the door, raising his bat. \nQUINT Duty first and pleasure after -- \nCLOSE - BRODY \nlooking up in horror, covering his face. \nQuint runs a line from the gin pole to the roof section. \nHooper climbs in though the top. \nHOOPER Take me up. \nBrody cranks the winch, hoisting cage and Hooper into the air. Quint balances the gin pole lines, Hooper crouching in the cage, examining it for stresses; satisfied, he holds out his hand. Quint puts the spear gun into it. \nCLOSE ON HOOPER IN THE CAGE \nHe examines his weapon, checking the power load, with the big wicked-looking syringe head uncapped to reveal its razor point. \nHOOPER Lower away, Chief. (then, to Quint) Try and keep him off me till I'm under. \nHooper inside, looking out the bars of the cage, gives Brody a reassuring smile, then pops his mouthpiece between his teeth and checks his regulator. Brody steps back, and with Quint guiding the cage, begins lowering it off the gin pole boom arm into the sea alongside the boat. \nBrody and Hooper stare at each another as their faces pass, Hooper sliding down into the cold grey ocean. \nAs Hooper disappears beneath the surface, Quint and Brody exchange a long look between them. \nUNDERWATER - CAGE \nHOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW \nSubmerging. The sky, horizon, water line, clean fresh sea air then... the magnificent innerspaces, with bubbles sparkling in front of us. \nANGLE - HOOPER IN THE CAGE \nas he floats to twenty feet Hooper never stops looking around 360 degrees. He removes the rubber guard from the needle and waits. \nEXT. THE SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT \nTheir turning heads tell us that the barrels are still circling. \nSuddenly, both heads stop turning. \nTHE SEA \nThe barrels have come to a stop. Delicately, they change course and meander toward the lowered cage. \nUNDERWATER - HOOPER \nHis back is to us. He is just now completing a visual sweep and turns, eyes front into closeup and: fixes wildly on something monstrous... and fascinating. \nHOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW \nThe water is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downward in the blue. From the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly -- comes the shark. It moves with no apparent effort, sinuous beyond comparison. As it nears the cage, it turns, and its ghastly length passes right in front of him: first the snout, then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye. \nHooper tentatively reaches out. It is too far for the strychnine pole. The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes, iron scars, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge the passing currents with pink. \nSURFACE \nThe trailing barrels gong and scratch the keel of the Orca above. Brody and Quint leap back. \nHOOPER - CLOSE \nThe shark has vanished into a cloud of rising silt. Hooper, expecting the shark to attack out of that same general direction, braces himself, pole extended through the bars, breathing faster, straining his eyes into the gloom and... we see that the shark attacking from behind him. \nThe cage is sent careening. Hooper grabs the bars for dear life. The shark has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending the bars like clothes hangers. Hooper can't turn the pointed end of the pole around, his body jammed as far away from the non-rational attacker as possible. \nHooper is trapped. \nThe shark withdraws to get some running room then charges again. The bleeding snout thrust deeper into the yawing bars, the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from Hooper's torso, the tail thrusting it forward. Hooper drops the strychnine pole between the bars and it tumbles slowly toward rapture depth. \nAll the shark needs is one more good thrust before separating Hooper at the waistline. Through frantic bubbles Hooper fumbles with the overhead hatch cover, kicking up and out of the cage. The shark backpedals with its tail, but the broad head won't shake loose. \nHooper rushes downwards, after the strychnine pole. \nANGLE - SHARK \nThe shark twists free of the cage and arrows downward after Hooper. \nHooper nearly recovers the pole. Again it slips from his frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow abyss. Hooper turns and looks up. \nThe Great White is lunging at him, twenty feet above. \nSURFACE \nOne of the barrel ropes snakes around the cage rope and pulls taut. \nHOOPER - DEEP \nTurning to meet the monster which -- though held back for a moment by the snarled rope -- now surges forward. \n", "test1_input": "KEISEL Look at those fences! Little guys about eight to ten years old. And look at this! \nHe holds up bicycle. The bicycle's spokes are bent and broken from some sort of blows. \nKEISEL They did that with their bare hands. \nBRODY Call me later in the day, okay, Harry? \nANGLE - AMITY GAZETTE NEWSPAPER OFFICE - PORCH \nSantos emerges with Ben Meadows, the stylish, late-thirties editor of the Amity Gazette. Together they cut a beeline for the other side of the street. \nANGLE - AMITY STREET \nPast taverns and chowder shacks, past bleacher construction and July Fourth posters, Brody enters Hardware and Sporting Goods... so overstocked that beach umbrellas, aluminum deck chairs, and rainbow beach towels splash a surplus of color from the display window to the sidewalk. \nINT. HARDWARE STORE \u0096 DAY \nThe store proprietor is busy at work on an inventory list with a mainland delivery man. \nLYNWOOD Stuff's no good to me in August when the Pilgrims come in June... (to Brody) Go on and help yourself to whatever you need, Chief. Can you work the register? \nEXT. HARDWARE STORE AND STREET - DAY \nBrody emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails, paint, and brushes to close every beach on the island. He starts back the way he came when Hendricks shoots up the street in the patrol jeep. He stops fast enough to call attention, leans out the window. \nHENDRICKS Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there. \nBRODY (hands him the sign material) Get out of there \u0096 take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing. \nHENDRICKS What's the matter with my printing? \nEXT. VAUGHN'S REALTY \u0096 DAY \nRevealing Larry Vaughn, the Mayor of Amity, exchanging anxieties with Ben Meadows and Coroner Santos and two other city Selectmen. They come out in a group, reach the sunlight, and squint down the street as Brody careens around the corner and out of sight. Deputy Hendricks, laden with his arts and crafts, passes them on the street front. \nVAUGHN What have you got there, Lenny? \nHENDRICKS We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach. \nVaughn and group exchange horrified looks, but we get the impression it is not in response to the shark-attack news. \nVAUGHN Who've you told this to, Lenny? \nHENDRICKS I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off. \nVAUGHN (to Meadows) Take my car, okay? (to Hendricks) You come with us, Lenny. \nHENDRICKS I've got all these signs here... \nVAUGHN C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say. \nThey all crowd into a Cadillac El Dorado with Vaughn Realty signs on the doors. \nEXT. AVRIL BAY - DAY \nA flotilla of twenty exhausted Boy Scouts round a buoy that marks the official course. A rowboat with Scoutmaster using a bullhorn keeps pace, and urges the boys on. \nSCOUTMASTER (bullhorn effect) Let's go, Robbie. You too, Hofner. Boyle, keep your head up. Alberts, keep kicking... (etc., ad lib) \nEXT. ON THE BEACH AT AVRIL BAY - DAY \nTwo older Seascouts look on with stop watches and clipboards, while some Parents shade their eyes from the sun, watching their offspring. Brody pulls up in the Amity Police jeep, and starts toward the people. Behind him, Vaughn's Cadillac pulls up and skids to a stop. In it are Vaughn, Meadows, the Doctor, maybe a Selectman, and Hendricks, with his arms still full of sign material. Vaughn intercepts Brody, the others circle around him, effectively slowing his progress through the sand to the scouts. \nVAUGHN Martin! (he catches up with him) Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority? \nBRODY Do I need any more authority? \nMEADOWS Technically, you need the instruction of a civic ordinance, or a special meeting of the town selectmen... \nVAUGHN (the good guy) That's just going by the book. We're just a little anxious that you're rushing into something serious here. This is your first summer. \nBRODY Now tell me something I don't know. \nVAUGHN All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island. \nBRODY So we should set out a smorgasbord? \nMEADOWS We're not even sure what it was. \nBRODY What else could've done that? \nVAUGHN (to Doctor) Boat propeller? \n", "test1_true": "VAUGHN Some weekend tramp accidentally goes swimming too far, she's a little drunk, a fishing boat comes along -- \nMEADOWS Remember when Fred Ganz went scalloping in his BVD's? He was going to swim to New Bedford, he said. \nThe men all laugh, ad lib their remembrances of this foolishness. \nMEADOWS ...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...? \nBRODY (interrupting the merriment) Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was! \nDOCTOR I was wrong. We'll have to amend the report. \nMEADOWS We never had that kind of trouble here. \nVAUGHN I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things. \nBRODY I was only reacting to what I was told. \nBrody looks out to the water where the scouts are rounding another buoy on the home stretch. \nVAUGHN (taking Brody aside) It's all psychological, anyway. You yell 'Barracuda' and everyone says 'huh'. You yell 'Shark' and we've got a panic on our hands. I think we all agree we don't need a panic this close to the 4th of July. \nVaughn indicates the beach where the Scouts are flopping out onto the sand, exhausted, glad to be finished. \nBRODY I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins. \nVAUGHN Martin, we hired the best man we could find. \nAll ad lib agreement. \nVAUGHN We need someone who isn't prejudiced by old feuds or family ties, someone who can referee things. \nMEADOWS You have our complete support. \nVAUGHN Now then. We've got a vandalism problem we ought to talk about... \nThe others surround Brody as Vaughn leads the way back to the cars, ad libbing their problem with the little karate choppers. \nHendricks puts the signs back into the trunk of Vaughn's Cadillac. Vaughn waves casually to the Scouts and swimmers who are vigorously toweling off in the background. \nEXT. AMITY STREET - DAY \nIn front of Amity's only Music Store, a battered old pick-up truck pulls in to the curb. Quint and his mate cross silently heading into the music store. \nINT. AMITY MUSIC STORE - DAY \nA gently tinkling bell tolls Quint's entrance. Inside the store, a ten-year-old boy is being shown a clarinet. He is playing a mellow low tone, and running \"Ode to Joy.\" Quint looms past him like Neptune rising from the deep, and lets his hand drop on the counter with a slap that sounds like a club on flesh. The Shopkeeper abandons the little boy and meets Quint. \nSHOPKEEPER Hello, Mr. Quint. \nQUINT Four spools of Number 12 piano wire, Okay? I ordered them. \nSHOPKEEPER (finding them under the counter) Yessir, right here. What do those fish do, eat this stuff? \nQUINT They choke on it. \nWithout waiting for it to be wrapped, he picks up the gleaming wire in his gnarled fist, and drops a bill on the counter. \nSHOPKEEPER Bye now. \nNo answer from Quint, who stops and sings along with the boy. \nThe little kid's music degenerates into a series of awkward squeaks and blurps, as Quint stares at him. Quint continues out the door, threading his way through the people in the street like some great fish. As he gets up into the cab of his pick-up, its door swings open so we can see a crude stylized shark decorating its side. It slams behind him as Quint gets in and drives away. \nEXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY \nA plump jelly-bowl of a woman plunges into the ocean. There's enough there to satisfy the most gluttonous shark. Buoyant, joyful, she splashes away in abandon. From her, we pan off to reveal other cheerful bathers enjoying that last uncluttered weekend before the season starts in earnest. \nANGLE ON THE WATERLINE \nA Man and his dog are romping at the water's edge. The Man is throwing a stick out into the surf, the dog, a happy retriever, is bounding into the waves after it. \nTWO YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE BEACH \nA Girl and her Boyfriend leave their blanket and run for the water, playing tag, chasing each other, having a wonderful time. \nANGLE ON BIRTHDAY PARTY ON THE SAND - MARTIN AND ELLEN BRODY \nHe is sitting stiffly in a beach chair, scanning the beach with careful, cautious looks, eyeballing everything that's going on. \nAround their particular blanket and umbrella are a number of adults and their kids, the youngsters gathered to celebrate Michael's birthday. Ellen is dishing out ice cream and cake from a cooler chest to the raucous 10-year-olds. Michael's hand is still bandaged. \n", "test2_input": "QUINT Are you now. I know about porkers in the water -- (throws him some rope) Here. Tie me a sheepshank. \nHooper ties the knot effortlessly. \nHOOPER I don't need to pass basic seamanship. \nQUINT Let me see your hands... \nHe takes Hooper's hands in his own big bloody fists, and feels them as he talks. \nQUINT Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means. \nHOOPER Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks... \nBRODY (interrupting) Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there... \nQUINT What do you mean 'We...?' \nBRODY It's my charter. My party. \nQUINT All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him... (indicates Hooper) ...along for ballast. \nBRODY You got it. \nEXT. QUINT'S DOCK - MORNING \nThe Mate is loading. He hands Quint the items on his check list as Quint takes them aboard. \nQUINT 5 lengths of 1/2-inch, 20 number 14's, straight gaff, flying gaffs, tail rope, eye splice, M-1, 20 clips, pliers, irons... \nAs he talks, we see Hooper coming down to the dock. Wheeling a wagon behind him are two long-haired Research Assistants from the Institute. On the wagon, among other things, is a big shark cage. At dockside, Hooper checks his list, as he signs for his issue. \nHOOPER Powerhead, CO2 darts, hypo, regulator, tanks, depth gauge, camera, extra magazines, cage... \nCLOSE - ON HOOPER AND RESEARCH ASSISTANT \nASSISTANT You got everything you asked for? \nHOOPER All of it. And thank Dr. Miro for me. And tell Borack I'll catch up with them in New Zealand. \nASSISTANT This is actually a killing expedition? \nHOOPER An eye for an eye, you know. \nQUINT Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait. \nHOOPER (to Assistant) I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello. \nHooper sees his gear approaching. \nANGLE ON DOCK AND ORCA \nQuint sees Hooper approaching with the large cage. \nQUINT Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut? (to himself) Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower? \nHOOPER Anti-Shark cage. \nQUINT Who's inside, you or the shark? \nHooper indicates \"me.\" \nQUINT You're in the cage? (Hooper nods) The cage is in the water? (Hooper nods) The shark is in the water too? (Hooper nods) You're in the water with the shark. \nHooper nods. Quint sings \"Spanish Ladies\" half to himself. \nHOOPER Comin' aboard... \nANGLE ON DOCK, BRODY AND ELLEN APPROACHING \nShe's carrying a little plastic shopping bag, he's wearing shiny new foul weather gear, bundled up, sweaty, uncomfortable. \nShe gives him as good a hug as she can manage under the circumstances. \nELLEN Did you take your dramamine? (Brody nods) Here. \nShe straightens his coat, and gives him a shaving kit to carry aboard with his toiletries. From the deck, Quint whistles derisively. \nQUINT Hurry up, Chief, daylight's a wastin'. \nELLEN Is that him? \nBRODY (to Ellen) Colorful, isn't he? \n", "test2_true": "BRODY Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this. \nELLEN I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit. \nBrody nods, and holds her hand for a wordless moment. \nQUINT (O.S.) (sings) 'Here is the body of Mary Lee. For 15 years she kept her virginity. Not a bad record for this vicinity.' \nThere is a sputter and roar as the Orca's diesels kick on. \nBRODY Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. \nELLEN (hugging him) What'll I tell the kids? \nBRODY Tell 'em I went fishin'! \nThey laugh together, and exchange a short, fierce kiss. \nQUINT Cast off the bow line! Now your stern! \nIts diesels chugging, the Orca pulls away from the pier. \nEllen has already resolutely turned her back on it, and is walking off the dock back onto dry land. \nABOARD THE ORCA \nQuint has set a course out towards the open sea. He lashes the wheel, and jumps down to address Hooper and Brody, who are standing together in the stern. \nQUINT (to Brody) Front-Bow, Back-Stern, Port, Starboard. Aloft, Below. It's not a staircase, it's a ladder, it's not a rope, it's a line, and if you don't get it right... (indicates porthole) I'll throw your ass through that little round window. \nHe laughs at his joke. This is probably something he tells all his charters. \nQUINT Now hear this. You're aboard the fishing vessel 'Orca,' and I'm her Captain, Master, Mate, and Owner. You'll jump when I holler. We're doin' a job here, and Christ, I ain't got time to watch you birds get hooks in your ass and fall overboard. Ship with me, and you'll do all right. Cross me, and I'll slap you upside your heads. Now -- if you boys are ready -- let's go fishin'. \nHe starts moving gear around, preparing chum barrels, setting hooks, Hooper gives him a hand, Brody stays out of the way. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE OCEAN - NOON \nIt is quiet as the Orca drifts along in the current, a wide chum slick spreading behind it. A couple of flag buoys spread along our perspective show us the miles the boat has gone. \nQuint spots something in the water -- a small blue shark attracted by the chum. He rigs a small pole with a piece of bait, and throws it over the side. \nQUINT Here's something for you... \nThe shark takes the bait, Quint brutally and efficiently sets the hook, and reels the shark alongside. He hauls it part way out of the water, and sticks it with a gaff. Hooper and Brody watch. \nINSERT - SHARK WRIGGLING ON HOOK \nTailrope dropping on him. Gaffed and bleeding, the shark is immobilized by Quint's practiced hands. He takes one of his big knives and poses for a moment beside the struggling fish. \nQUINT These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat their own guts. \nHe slices into the shark's underbelly. We hear the sound of entrails plopping into the water. Brody is almost retching, and Hooper is just displeased. \nANGLE ON THE WATER \nThe gutted shark swimming in circles biting at its own entrails. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nFins closing in on the wounded shark. \nQUINT Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em where you got it! \nSHARK FRENZY \nA boil of water and the flash of fins and teeth as the local sharks erupt in a feeding frenzy, jaws snapping, blood spewing, a sudden display of the fury and blind predatory drive of the fearsome species. \nHOOPER What's that supposed to prove? \nQUINT Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap... \nHOOPER AND BRODY REACT AS WE \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. THE OCEAN - AFTERNOON \nThe Orca is drifting in neutral. The ocean is like gelatin, the sun sucking heat waves from its surface. Brody at the stern, handkerchief on his head to protect from further sunburn, has been handed the slimiest job on a shark hunt: the ladling out of chum. There are several empty chum barrels. A flag buoy bobs in the wake of the boat, another waits to be tossed over the side. Brody is reeling with nausea. He opens his overnight kit and takes out a handkerchief and some Old Spice after-shave. He pours the after-shave into the cloth, presses it to his nose. Hooper is also in the stern. \n", "test3_input": "QUINT Get ready! Now snag 'em! \nTogether Brody and Hooper hook a barrel-rope and hold on for dear life as the shark changes course. \nQUINT Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto the transom -- free ride. \nBrody and Hooper pull in with all they are worth as Quint helps out by wheeling in a circle. He laughs to himself, enjoying the spectacle. \nCLOSE - HOOPER \nsecuring the rope to a cleat but allowing the barrel to hang overboard. Brody ties his now-perfect bowline adjacent cleat. \nWIDE ANGLE - ORCA \nThe boat is jarred violently from side to side as the underwater force of the Great White jerks and heaves them to and fro, up and down, side to side... \nANGLE - HOOPER AND BRODY \nare both torn off their feet as the boat is thrust forward. \nFLYBRIDGE - QUINT \nsees the fin ahead. It is pulling the boat. \nQUINT Get tired! That's the idea! Here's a little reverse for you! \nThe shark leaps partially out of the water, and the sight is both horrifying and awesome. Its jaws break water, snapping at the ropes that have him snarled and frustrated. \nQuint throws the Orca into neutral and shouts down: \nQUINT Haul in -- watch the prop! \nWith that, Quint slides down to the prow, putting another shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and balance. The shark can be seen directly ahead, threshing closer. \nQUINT Now! Untie 'em! Quick! He'll tear us to pieces. \nHe fires the iron, and the shark veers downward in a gushing shower of spray. \nHOOPER AND BRODY \nThey are trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes are stretched too taut. They jump out of the way, falling flat \non the deck as the ropes sweep over them, knocking over objects, skeetering across the deck. A tight jerking motion, and the Orca is dragged through the water -- backwards. And much too fast. Water is splashing up over the transom in its backward wake. The engines groan and complain. \nQUINT Damn head is too far away. He's too big. \nWrenched to one side, Quint is knocked from his feet. \nCLOSE - THE TWO CLEATS \nA moment of slackness, and then a great surge of raw strength. \nThe rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintered wood spraying -- and the barrels fly over the water. They disappear beneath the turbulent grey surface. \nThe three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouring sweat, look out at the blank water. \nANGLE - OCEAN \nPop -- pop -- pop. One, two, three, the barrels surface -- ready for more. \nQUINT (amazed at the shark's strength) He can't go so deep. Not with all those on him. \nBrody looks down at his feet. There is salt water up to their shoe tops. \nBRODY What about us? \nQUINT (mentally assessing the damage) Have to pump her steady, s'all. \nThe barrels start a wide circle, each cuts through the water, pushing a wave before it and leaving a wake behind. \nQUINT (to Hooper) Follow him -- (to Brody) You start pumpin' out here. \nQuint tosses Brody the hand pump, then picks up his M-1, and checks the load. \nHOOPER (O.S.) (on bridge) He's heading under -- ! \nQUINT (incredulously) No way! He can't! \nANGLE - OCEAN \nThe barrels approaching the Orca dip below the surface, one -- two -- three. \nBRODY Where'd he go? \n", "test3_true": "QUINT (helplessly) He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?! \nBRODY Have you ever had one do this? \nQUINT (and he means this) No! \nBooming thud at the keel. Brody slides on the wet deck and Quint loses his footing, falling into Brody's arms. \nWITH HOOPER ON THE FLY BRIDGE \nIt seems the only place out of reach of the shark. Quint climbs up, Brody following him, reloading his pistol. \nJust then, the barrels pop up ahead, veer left, and duck under. \nQUINT Follow him! \nHOOPER He's under! \nBRODY AND HIS POINT OF VIEW \nBRODY There! (points wildly) \nThe barrels have surfaced and we see the monster shadow sliding under the Orca, seemingly endless. Violent scraping sounds. \nBRODY He's trying to sink us! \nQUINT (to Hooper) Dead astern! Zig-zag! \nQuint is grimly silent. Brody senses that Quint is in the fight of (and for) his life. \nThe Orca taking evasive action. But the three barrels are closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destroying themselves with every rotation of the damaged shaft. \nBRODY He's chasing us! I don't believe it. \nQUINT Full throttle! To port! \nANGLE ON THE BRIDGE \nHooper is jamming the throttle forward, but the engine is pounding and knocking wildly. The barrels circle and move in. Quint has his rifle ready. \nHOOPER (suddenly giving Quint the wheel) Hold her. \nHe leaps to his gear, trying desperately to get his dart gun. \nJust then, the shark attacks, breaking water and rising over the boat like a rocket; snout, jaws, pectoral fins, belly, falling sideways. A vast spray drenches the men. Quint fires into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness. \nHOOPER (loading) Keep him there! Keep him! \nThe Orca shudders from side to side. From Hooper's point of view we can the shark gripping the transom in his jaws, shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to side, trying to tear a chunk out of the very hull. Quint has reloaded and is firing into the fish. Brody has a wicked pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing and gouging it, trying for the eyes. The killing lust is on all three men. \nQUINT Throttling back! \nThe boat surges, the shark gives a final unbalances wrench, and disengages. The dorsal fin circles off, beginning a wide loop around the boat. \nThe engine quivers and dies, the boat without power, rolling half awash, a wounded victim. \nThe fin dips, the barrels follow, the shark disappears beneath the waves. There is complete silence. \nTHE THREE MEN ON DECK \nIn the dead quiet, we can hear the lap of waves against the hull, the hoarse panting breathing of the men, the pings and pops of the cooling, dying engines. \nQUINT AND THE TRANSOM \nHe eyes the stern. Huge cracks and broken timber testify to the fury of the attack. \nQUINT (very quietly, to Hooper) What can that gun of yours do? \nHOOPER Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close. \nBRODY (the awful realization) You gotta go in the water... \nCUT TO: \nON DECK, LATER \nQuint and Hooper are assembling the shark cage, its shiny bars the only undamaged things on deck. Brody is working too, bolting the sections together. \nHOOPER (in command now) Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts. \nThe men are speaking in near whispers, quiet in the silence that surrounds them. Hooper is in his wet suit, adjusting weights, mask, tanks, etc. The cage is standing in the stern. \n"}

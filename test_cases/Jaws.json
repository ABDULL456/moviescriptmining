{"test1_input": "Michael is tacking full-sail in his boat with a friend, Kit. \nKit is admiring the shark's tooth necklace around his own neck while Michael rubs some water on the scratches left by it. \nThe fin, huge, black and real, crosses behind them. They are not yet aware. The fin seems to circle and return. It heads toward Michael's boat when another small dinghy gets in its way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thermos of coffee when he is \"bumped.\" The entire boat is overturned. Michael sees the fin now as it collides with him, the entire bow lifting out of the water and rolling over on the port side. \nMichael and Kit are thrown head first. \nThree heads in the water come up sputtering, the fin between them crossing back. Michael freezes. The fin comes directly at him, growing into the sky, passing him so close he could touch it, but ignoring him as it follows the flailing and panicked weekend novice. Catches him. Michael watches. That all too familiar explosion of water -- a choked off scream -- the head and upper torso of the novice passing Michael swiftly as though being carried off -- a current of blood trailing behind. \nTHE VICTIM (passing a horrified Michael, who half extends one hand, as if to help) It's no good. I'm dead... (and he is) \nA renewed cry of shark! \nCLOSE - BRODY \nHe turns. Oh God! Running through the slogging sand. \nCLOSE - ELLEN \nA sudden turn. She runs. \nCLOSE - HOOPER IN BOAT \nHe's got the walkie-talkie to his mouth. \nHOOPER Block the estuary! The estuary! \nThree boats racing to carry out the orders. The black fin re- passing the two children, racing to get out. Hooper reaches the mouth before the others. The fin won't veer off. It smacks into the little vessel, bumping it aside. The fin is left racing into open water. Blood leavings. Hooper leaping over the side, slogging towards Michael. \nWIDE ON WATER \nCopter roars in buzzing the shark, but too late. \nCLOSE - BRODY AND ELLEN \nThey are pulling Michael out of the water as Hooper splashes up. Michael is conscious but in shock -- his eyes staring at nothing. \nBRODY (feeling his face) He's in shock. Get blankets! \nPeople gather and Brody snatches beach towels out of their hands. They cover Michael and carry him off the beach, feet raised above his head. \nINT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nMichael is wheeled out in the bed. Brody and Ellen are there. \nSean is sleepy in Brody's arms. Vaughn is waiting in the hall. \nNURSE The doctor said it's okay -- mild shock. He can come home in the morning. \nELLEN (to Michael) Hey, big guy -- you want anything from home? \nMICHAEL My cars. And a comic book. \nBRODY (sees Vaughn) Here -- (gives baby to Ellen) Take him home. \nELLEN Home... New York? \nBRODY No. Home here. \nEllen exits. \nBRODY (crossing to Vaughn) Got a pen on you? \nVAUGHN Why? \nBRODY There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor. \nVAUGHN I don't know if I can do that without a... \nBRODY (interrupting) I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead. \nVAUGHN Maybe we can save August... \nBRODY Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that? \nVAUGHN I was acting in the town's best interests... \nBRODY The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me. (indicates paper) Right there. Whatever it costs. \nVAUGHN My kids were on that beach... \nBRODY Just sign it, Larry. \n", "test1_true": "QUINT'S HOUSE - DAY \nBrody and Hooper are approaching Quint's house. They enter through the big wooden doors, into another circle of Hell. \nSmoke and steam from two big oil drums sitting over fires fills the air. Quint and his mate, Herschel, are grinding pieces of pilot whale into chum. The whale lies bloody on the floor, its ruined carcass adding to the stench of other sharks being boiled in the drums, their tails suspended in the air. \nDiesel fumes and decay fill the air, and tools, ropes, broken bits of iron and engine parts litter the floor. Wall hangings of rope and floats, and buoys, barrels, tackle and gear all conspire to frame the killing floor. \nBrody and Hooper navigate the obstacle course. \nBRODY This has got to be one big violation... \nHOOPER (handling some gear) This is quite a place. \nQUINT'S VOICE Keep your hands off my stuff. \nHe emerges from the steam and smoke. \nQUINT Did you bring a check? \nBRODY What? \nQUINT Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise? \nBRODY I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. \nQUINT And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not. \nBRODY You got it. \nQUINT And incidental damages, if any... \nBRODY You got it. \nQUINT And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property. \nBRODY You got it. \nQUINT And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch. \nBRODY Two cases. And dinner when you land. \nQUINT (pours drink) Try some of this. I made it myself. \nBrody tastes. \nQUINT Here's to swimmin' with bowlegged women. \nHerschel interrupts. He's stopped working, and is wiping his hands on a bloody rag. \nHERSCHEL Mr. Quint... \nQuint wheels to face him. \nHERSCHEL I'm not goin'. No sir. \nQUINT You want to get paid, you go. \nHERSCHEL Forget the money. You can't pay me enough. I ain't crazy. I worked some big mean fish with you, but I ain't goin' on this one. \nQUINT This is the last time I hear from you. I don't want anyone with piss for blood on my vessel. Put that blackfish on board, pump the bilges, and top off the fuel tanks, and finish up in the morning. Then you're on the beach. \nHOOPER You're going to need an extra hand... \nQuint turns to see this new voice, and starts walking towards him. \nBRODY This is Matt Hooper... \nQUINT I know who he is... \nBRODY He's from the Oceanographic Institute. \nHOOPER I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs -- \nQUINT Transplants? \nHOOPER -- and an America's Cup Trials... \nQUINT I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking. \nHOOPER And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White. \n", "test1_id": 357, "test2_input": "The barrel is surfaced directly ahead of them, just off the port side. They are drifting up to it. \nBRODY The barrel! \nThe strobe light winks at them. Quint holds up a hand: \"Quiet!\" \nEverything stops as they watch the barrel coming slowly up on them. \nQUINT It's him. \nHe takes a killing lance from the rack. Hooper gets a boathook. \nQUINT He's under the keg. Careful -- \nHooper leans out gingerly, snagging the barrel with the hook. \nIt bobs lightly in the water, an innocent bystander. Hooper shifts his pole, takes hold of the rope, poling it in. \nQUINT (suspicious) Easy -- just want to goose him up. The minute he runs, drop it or you'll lose your hands. \nHooper gets the line and starts hauling it up. No resistance. \nIt comes easily over the transom into a coil on the deck. He and Quint exchange looks. \nQUINT Here -- gimme. I don't see what he's been doin'. \nWATER - ANGLE \nBoth men are draped over the side, their chins almost touching the water on the aft side. From the opposite starboard direction, fully unfastened from the barrel, comes the Great White. First the fin, then the conical nose and the upper border of wide, grinning teeth. It knifes through the water in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed toward the unsuspecting men. \nCLOSE - BRODY \nHis instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquired sense of direction. \nBRODY (top of his lungs) Shark! Starboard! \nCLOSE - HOOPER AND QUINT \nThey turn just in time, and a long spine-stretch saves them from instant decapitation. The Great White passes the transom, the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed- off cable. It rolls on its side and looks at them as it passes. \nPast the stern the huge tail lashes out, ripping the rope out of Quint's hands, shearing a huge swath through the paint, peeling it off like a plane, taking one of the bronze letters out of \"Orca.\" The shark begins an arc to sea, its fin cutting the water, and starts circling the boat. Quint notices his cut hand, palm bleeding, realizing how close he came to losing it. \nQUINT (to Hooper) Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us! (then to Brody on the bridge) Start the engine! \nThe diesels start with a terrible grinding. \nQUINT Easy! It'll tear right out! \nHOOPER (hauling) The shaft is giving. \nHooper slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, clearing the deck for action once again. \nBRODY (on bridge) That's it! Radio in for help! \nQUINT Shut up! Just pump her out! \nBRODY (coming down off the bridge) Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call. \nBrody heads for the radio in the pilot house. \nQUINT - CLOSE \nA perfectly terrible look comes over him. He raises up and starts after Brody. Brody disappears into the cabin. Quint pauses outside and sees: \nINSERT - QUINT'S LEAD-CENTERED BASEBALL BAT \nhis calloused hand grabs it up fiercely. \nINT. RADIO SHACK \nBrody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on the complex console. \nQUINT (O.S.) Beg your pardon -- \nANGLE - DOORWAY \nQuint appears, silhouetted in the hot light of the door, raising his bat. \nQUINT Duty first and pleasure after -- \nCLOSE - BRODY \nlooking up in horror, covering his face. \n", "test2_true": "Quint brings down the bat with all the strength he can summon. \nCrash! \nSparks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of metal ricochet all over the cabin as Quint demolishes the ship-to-shore radio. \nQuint takes a happy breath, winks at Brody and hands him the bat. \nQUINT Excuse me! \nBrody's adrenaline turns his fear into rage. His glasses are cracked or broken by flying pieces of radio. He seizes the bat, and pound the shattered radio for emphasis. \nBRODY Some great idea! Now where are we? Some goddamn skipper you are. You're certifiable, y'know that? You're a real treat! Certifiable! Bananas! \nHis tirade is interrupted by an urgent bellow from Hooper. \nCLOSE - HOOPER \nPointing at the fin. \nHOOPER Coming right to us! \nQUINT No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on -- (the engine clanks) Slower! Throttle back --- \nANGLE - OVER THE BOW \nQUINT (raising harpoon) Hard to port! \nHooper pulls the boat into a tight turn and Quint has a shot at the upward rolling flank. He sinks it with careful precision. \nQUINT Try shakin' that out! \nBrody emerges from the cabin as the rope zips overboard, and the barrel, changing over, catapults into the air before plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash. \nBRODY (shouting to Quint) Did you get him in the head? \nQUINT (to Brody) No! No! No! (to Hooper) Swing around! After him! \nON THE FLYBRIDGE \nHooper can see the fin racing ahead of the barrel. Diving down. Up again -- Quint prepares another iron. Brody is digging in his bag. He comes up with his 2\" .357 service revolver. \nQUINT More gas... go to half! Get me right alongside him -- \nThe engine thuds and knocks. \nHOOPER (shouting down) We can't rev it up this high -- \nSuddenly the barrel gongs into the side of the Orca. \nQUINT Watch it! \nHooper skillfully avoids the speeding rope. \nQUINT Atta boy! \nQuint leans to one side, harpoon over his head. The Great White breaks water and... \nQUINT Take two, they're small! \nHe sinks it deep. We hear shots. As the new rope whips out, Brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, in regulation police combat pistol stance, holding his .357 in both hands, firing at the shark's head. \nQuint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the barrel goes over. \nHOOPER (shouting at Brody) Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already! \nBRODY I can't stand here doing nothing! \nQUINT Order in the court! \nWATER LEVEL ANGLE \nHe has seen the two barrels pop to the surface. \nQUINT (racing over) Three'll do it! He's havin' trouble with two! \nHe yells to Hooper and Brody as he swings behind the controls. \nQUINT Grab yourselves a couple of poles! \nQuint steers \"Slow Ahead,\" engine protesting, as he maneuvers toward the moving barrels. Quint peers down, steering closer and closer. \n", "test2_id": 358, "test3_input": "QUINT Get ready! Now snag 'em! \nTogether Brody and Hooper hook a barrel-rope and hold on for dear life as the shark changes course. \nQUINT Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto the transom -- free ride. \nBrody and Hooper pull in with all they are worth as Quint helps out by wheeling in a circle. He laughs to himself, enjoying the spectacle. \nCLOSE - HOOPER \nsecuring the rope to a cleat but allowing the barrel to hang overboard. Brody ties his now-perfect bowline adjacent cleat. \nWIDE ANGLE - ORCA \nThe boat is jarred violently from side to side as the underwater force of the Great White jerks and heaves them to and fro, up and down, side to side... \nANGLE - HOOPER AND BRODY \nare both torn off their feet as the boat is thrust forward. \nFLYBRIDGE - QUINT \nsees the fin ahead. It is pulling the boat. \nQUINT Get tired! That's the idea! Here's a little reverse for you! \nThe shark leaps partially out of the water, and the sight is both horrifying and awesome. Its jaws break water, snapping at the ropes that have him snarled and frustrated. \nQuint throws the Orca into neutral and shouts down: \nQUINT Haul in -- watch the prop! \nWith that, Quint slides down to the prow, putting another shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and balance. The shark can be seen directly ahead, threshing closer. \nQUINT Now! Untie 'em! Quick! He'll tear us to pieces. \nHe fires the iron, and the shark veers downward in a gushing shower of spray. \nHOOPER AND BRODY \nThey are trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes are stretched too taut. They jump out of the way, falling flat \non the deck as the ropes sweep over them, knocking over objects, skeetering across the deck. A tight jerking motion, and the Orca is dragged through the water -- backwards. And much too fast. Water is splashing up over the transom in its backward wake. The engines groan and complain. \nQUINT Damn head is too far away. He's too big. \nWrenched to one side, Quint is knocked from his feet. \nCLOSE - THE TWO CLEATS \nA moment of slackness, and then a great surge of raw strength. \nThe rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintered wood spraying -- and the barrels fly over the water. They disappear beneath the turbulent grey surface. \nThe three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouring sweat, look out at the blank water. \nANGLE - OCEAN \nPop -- pop -- pop. One, two, three, the barrels surface -- ready for more. \nQUINT (amazed at the shark's strength) He can't go so deep. Not with all those on him. \nBrody looks down at his feet. There is salt water up to their shoe tops. \nBRODY What about us? \nQUINT (mentally assessing the damage) Have to pump her steady, s'all. \nThe barrels start a wide circle, each cuts through the water, pushing a wave before it and leaving a wake behind. \nQUINT (to Hooper) Follow him -- (to Brody) You start pumpin' out here. \nQuint tosses Brody the hand pump, then picks up his M-1, and checks the load. \nHOOPER (O.S.) (on bridge) He's heading under -- ! \nQUINT (incredulously) No way! He can't! \nANGLE - OCEAN \nThe barrels approaching the Orca dip below the surface, one -- two -- three. \nBRODY Where'd he go? \n", "test3_true": "QUINT (helplessly) He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?! \nBRODY Have you ever had one do this? \nQUINT (and he means this) No! \nBooming thud at the keel. Brody slides on the wet deck and Quint loses his footing, falling into Brody's arms. \nWITH HOOPER ON THE FLY BRIDGE \nIt seems the only place out of reach of the shark. Quint climbs up, Brody following him, reloading his pistol. \nJust then, the barrels pop up ahead, veer left, and duck under. \nQUINT Follow him! \nHOOPER He's under! \nBRODY AND HIS POINT OF VIEW \nBRODY There! (points wildly) \nThe barrels have surfaced and we see the monster shadow sliding under the Orca, seemingly endless. Violent scraping sounds. \nBRODY He's trying to sink us! \nQUINT (to Hooper) Dead astern! Zig-zag! \nQuint is grimly silent. Brody senses that Quint is in the fight of (and for) his life. \nThe Orca taking evasive action. But the three barrels are closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destroying themselves with every rotation of the damaged shaft. \nBRODY He's chasing us! I don't believe it. \nQUINT Full throttle! To port! \nANGLE ON THE BRIDGE \nHooper is jamming the throttle forward, but the engine is pounding and knocking wildly. The barrels circle and move in. Quint has his rifle ready. \nHOOPER (suddenly giving Quint the wheel) Hold her. \nHe leaps to his gear, trying desperately to get his dart gun. \nJust then, the shark attacks, breaking water and rising over the boat like a rocket; snout, jaws, pectoral fins, belly, falling sideways. A vast spray drenches the men. Quint fires into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness. \nHOOPER (loading) Keep him there! Keep him! \nThe Orca shudders from side to side. From Hooper's point of view we can the shark gripping the transom in his jaws, shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to side, trying to tear a chunk out of the very hull. Quint has reloaded and is firing into the fish. Brody has a wicked pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing and gouging it, trying for the eyes. The killing lust is on all three men. \nQUINT Throttling back! \nThe boat surges, the shark gives a final unbalances wrench, and disengages. The dorsal fin circles off, beginning a wide loop around the boat. \nThe engine quivers and dies, the boat without power, rolling half awash, a wounded victim. \nThe fin dips, the barrels follow, the shark disappears beneath the waves. There is complete silence. \nTHE THREE MEN ON DECK \nIn the dead quiet, we can hear the lap of waves against the hull, the hoarse panting breathing of the men, the pings and pops of the cooling, dying engines. \nQUINT AND THE TRANSOM \nHe eyes the stern. Huge cracks and broken timber testify to the fury of the attack. \nQUINT (very quietly, to Hooper) What can that gun of yours do? \nHOOPER Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close. \nBRODY (the awful realization) You gotta go in the water... \nCUT TO: \nON DECK, LATER \nQuint and Hooper are assembling the shark cage, its shiny bars the only undamaged things on deck. Brody is working too, bolting the sections together. \nHOOPER (in command now) Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts. \nThe men are speaking in near whispers, quiet in the silence that surrounds them. Hooper is in his wet suit, adjusting weights, mask, tanks, etc. The cage is standing in the stern. \n", "test3_id": 359}

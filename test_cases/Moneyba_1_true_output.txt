BILLY Scott Hatteberg. 
POTE Who? 
BILLY Exactly. Sounds like an Oakland A already. Yes, he's got a little damage in his elbow. 
GRADY Some damage? He can't throw. 
BILLY We're not interested in him for his arm anymore than we wanted Giambi for his. 
GRADY Wait, you're talkin' about Hatteberg at first? 
BILLY Yes. 
HOPKINS He's a career .260 hitter and the good part of his career is over. 
BILLY I say it's just starting. 
PITTARO Well, Billy, you'll like the sound of this... I hear Boston wants to cut him and no one wants to pick him up. 
BILLY That's good news for us. He's cheap. 
GRADY Let me understand this. At first base you want a guy who's been cut from half of the minor league teams in the country due to irreparable nerve damage? 
BILLY He can't hit and he can't field, but what can he do? 
(BEAT) Look at the piece of paper or I'm going to point at Peter. The SCOUTS consult their spreadsheets and then answer 
HALF-HEARTEDLY-- 
SCOUTS 
(HALF-HEARTEDLY) He can get-- 
BILLY He can get on base. 
POLONI Alright, so he walks a lot. 
BILLY He gets on base a lot, Rocco. Do I care if it's a walk or a hit? 
PETER You do not. 
POLONI These three players, by your own admission, are defective in one way or another. 
BILLY Yeah. 
GRADY You want to replace Jason Giambi with not one but three defective players? 
BILLY You got it. 
GRADY Billy, we've all been busting our asses the last six and a half weeks to make this a better ball-- 
BILLY (cutting him off) Grady, it's not a discussion. 
POTE I think we're all losing sight of the fact that you're the general manager. You only have to answer to ownership and God. 
BILLY I didn't know God followed baseball. 
POTE I hope he does. 
Some of the scouts look over in Peter's direction, no doubt wondering if he's had something to do with their general manager's ideas. 
WASHINGTON Billy, I just don't see it. 
BILLY That's okay, Wash. We won't be victimized by what we see anymore. 
WASHINGTON I understand what you're saying about their averages, but there's something you're forgetting. None of them plays first base. 
BILLY I haven't forgotten that, Wash. One of them is going to have to learn. 
WASHINGTON Learn. 
BILLY You're going to have to teach him. 
WASHINGTON Teach. 
BILLY Instruct. 
WASHINGTON Which one? 
33 EXT/INT. TACOMA HOUSE - NIGHT 33 
A Christmas tree. Four stockings hang from the mantle. The phone rings. SCOTT HATTEBERG gets up. He looks at it. Looks at his wife. Picks it up. 
SCOTT Hello? 
BILLY (VO) Scott? 
SCOTT Yes? 
BILLY (VO) It's Billy Beane. Oakland A's. 
SCOTT was expecting that it would be someone else... 
SCOTT Yes? 
BILLY (VO) Can we talk? 
SCOTT Yes. 
BILLY (VO) You want to invite me in? 
SCOTT What? 
BILLY (VO) I'm outside. I can see you in the window. SCOTT goes to the window and cups his hands against the glass to see outside. 
ELIZABETH Honey? 
Two silhouettes are standing on the edge of the fairway. One of them waves. 
34 INT. SCOTT HATTEBERG'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT 34 
ELIZABETH is putting out some cookies shaped like stars and bells for the late-night guests: BILLY and RON 
WASHINGTON. 
BILLY Thank you, ma'am. 
WASHINGTON Thank you, ma'am. 
She leaves her husband with the two men but listens in on their conversation from the next room, nibbling on a cookie of her own. 
BILLY You've played catcher your whole life? 
SCOTT Since I was 8. BILLY produces a baseball from his windbreaker and hands it to SCOTT. SCOTT can only manage to grip the baseball like a claw. Washington looks to heaven. 
BILLY How's the elbow? 
SCOTT Good. Real good. It's great.

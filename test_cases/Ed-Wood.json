{"test1_input": "\"Ed Wood\", by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski \nED WOOD \nby Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski \nDirected by Tim Burton \nFIRST DRAFT \nNovember 20, 1992 \nFADE IN: \nINT. HAUNTED MANSION PARLOR - NIGHT \nWe move through a spooky shrouded parlor, as a storm rages outside.  THUNDER roars, and lightning flashes in the giant windows.  in the center of the room lies an oak coffin. \nSuddenly the lid starts to creak open. A hand crawls past the edge... and then the lid slams up!  Famed psychic CRISWELL pops out.  Criswell, 40, peers at us intently, his gleaming eyes framed under his striking pale blonde hair.  He intones, with absolute conviction: \nCRISWELL Greetings, my friend.  You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable... that is why you are here. So now, for the first time, we are bringing you the full story of what happened... (extremely serious) We are giving you all the evidence, based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal.  The incidents, the places, my friend, we cannot keep this a secret any longer. Can your hearts stand the shocking facts of the true story of Edward D. Wood, Junior?? \nEXT. NIGHT SKY \nLightning CRACKS. \nWe drift down past the dark clouds... through the torrential rain... and end up... \nOPTICAL: \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT \nWe've landed in Hollywood, 1952.  We're outside a teeny, grungy playhouse.  The cracked marquee proclaims \"'THE CASUAL COMPANY,' WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY EDWARD D. WOOD, JR.\" \nPacing nervously in the rain is ED WOOD, 30, our hero. Larger-than-life charismatic, confident, Errol Flynn-style handsome, Ed is a human magnet.  He's a classically flawed optimist: Sweet and well-intentioned, yet doomed by his demons within. \nThe doors open, and Ed's pal JOHN \"BUNNY\" BRECKINRIDGE, 45, hurries out.  Bunny is a wealthy, theatrical fop wearing a string of pearls. \n[PAGE 2 MISSING] \nSuddenly the rest of the cast runs up, frantically upset.  In a flowing white dress is DOLORES FULLER, 23, a sharp, hungry- for-a-career ingenue.  She's near tears. \nDOLORES Eddie, my dove just flew out the window! \nCREW MEMBER She goes on in two minutes! What are we gonna do?? \nThey all look to Ed, awaiting a response.  He thinks a second, then excitedly CLAPS his hands. \nED Dolores, give me your shoes. \nDOLORES What? \nED The ghost can be barefoot.  Give me your shoes! \nShe hands Ed her white shoes.  He snatches one, grabs a pair of scissors, and starts CUTTING up the shoe.  Everyone is baffled. He keeps cutting the shoe... and it slowly takes on the shape of a dove! \nEd then grabs some pipe cleaners, works them into a shape, and sprints into the dressing room.  He takes some green eye shadow and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners.  Ed then hurries back out, jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut-up shoe... and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth! \nThe cast is flabbergasted. \nCREW MEMBER Wow. \nBACK ONSTAGE \nThe soldiers suddenly look up. \nACTOR #1 Hey, I think I see something! \nDolores floats down onto the stage, holding out the dove. \nDOLORES I offer you mortals the bird of peace, so that you may change your ways and end all this destruction. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCRUFFY COFFEE SHOP - LATER THAT NIGHT \nEd and his gang celebrate opening night in a dirty 24-hour diner.  They're noisily slugging down drinks, in a big red booth. \nED What a show!  Everyone was terrific! Paul, your second-act monologue actually gave me chills, \nHe grins at Actor #1, aka PAUL MARCO, a young eager beaver who's loyal like a dog. \nPAUL MARCO Aw thanks, Eddie. \nActor #2, aka CONRAD BROOKS, a friendly, simple-minded lug, runs up waving a newspaper. \nCONRAD I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand. \nED (he smiles at everyone) This is the big moment...! \nEd opens the paper to the entertainment page. \nINSERT - THE NEWSPAPER.  Ed turns to a column, \"The Theatrical Life, By Victor Crowley.\"  Under this is a photograph of an old man with an ascot. \nWIDE \nEverybody excitedly crowds around and starts reading.   A moment... and then their faces drop.  Clearly, this is a disastrous review.  Their faces get sadder, and sadder... and then they finish.  A melancholy beat, until -- \nBUNNY What does that old queen know?  He wasn't even there! (he knocks back a drink) Sending a copy boy to do his dirty work.  Well fuck him! \nDOLORES Do I really have a face like a horse? \nPAUL MARCO What does \"ostentatious\" mean? \nEd calmly waves his arms for attention.  He tries to smile. \nED Hey.  Hey, it's not that bad.  You just can't concentrate on the negative.  He's got some nice things to say... (he scans the review) See, \"The soldier costumes are very realistic.\"  That's positive! \nEveryone kind of stares at their drinks, depressed.  Ed launches into an upbeat speech. \nED Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last \"Francis the Mule\" picture -- it got terrible notices.  But it was a huge hit. \nPAUL MARCO Lines around the block. \nED So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work. \nCONRAD You really think so? \nED Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous. \nHe smiles at everyone at the table.  They all believe what he says, and there is a hushed moment of dream-filled hope. \n", "test1_true": "INT. DOLORES' APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT \nEd and Dolores lie in bed, in the dark.  He stares vulnerably at her. \nED Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it? \nDOLORES Ed, it was only one review. \nED Orson Welles was 26 when he made \"Citizen Kane.\"  I'm already 30! \nDOLORES Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're supposed to be struggling. \nED I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get... \nDolores kisses Ed affectionately. \nDOLORES Things'll change for us.  Nobody stays on the fringe forever. \nShe gets out of bed.  We see her tiny apartment is drab and crumbling.  Dolores turns on the shower, then walks to the closet.  She looks inside. \nDOLORES God, where's my pink sweater?  I can never find my clothes anymore... \nANGLE - ED \nHe rolls over in bed, away from her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STUDIO WAREHOUSE - DAY \nCU on Ed reading \"The Hollywood Reporter.\"  A RUDE BOSS in suspenders suddenly strides up. \nRUDE BOSS Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building. \nED Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz. \nEd jumps up.  We WIDEN, revealing he's in a giant greenhouse, packed with rows of potted plants and shrubs.  Ed grabs a small palm tree and hurries out. \nEXT. MOVIE STUDIO - DAY \nEd strolls across the busy movie lot, lugging the palm.  He passes a soundstage and notices the stage door open a crack. Ed glances around, then puts down the palm and hurries in. \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE \u00f3 SAME TIME \nA big-budget foreign legion movie is shooting, with a huge cast and crew. A giant desert set has been erected, with camels and real sand dunes. Ed is blown away. \nED Whoa, look at all this sand.  This is real sand!  My God, where'd they get all this sand?! \nA SECURITY GUARD sees him. \nSECURITY GUARD Hey, YOU.  This is a closed set. \nEd is caught.  He hurries out. \nEXT. MOVIE STUDIO \u00f3 DAY \nEd continues across the lot, carrying his palm tree.  An OLD CRUSTY MAN sticks his head out an office window. \nOLD CRUSTY MAN Hey, Eddie!  Come in here.  I got some great new stuff to show you. \nEd puts down the plant again and runs in. \nINT. EDITING ROOMS \u00f3 DAY \nThe old guy is proudly showing Ed STOCK FOOTAGE on a moviola. The footage is totally random: Giant explosions, buffalos stampeding, tanks, an octopus swimming, etc. \nEd is dazzled. \nED This is fantastic!  What are you gonna do with it all? \nOLD CRUSTY MAN Eh, probably file it away and never see it again. \nED It's such a waste.  If I had half a chance, I could make an entire movie out of this stock footage! (getting inspired) See, the story opens with these mysterious explosions.  Nobody knows what's causing them, but it's upsetting all the buffalo.  So the military is called in to solve the mystery. \nOLD CRUSTY MAN Ya forgot the octopus. \nED No, I'm saving that for the big underwater climax! \nThe old guy cackles. \nEXT. MOVIE STUDIO - DAY \nEd finally carries the tree into the Laemmle Building. \nINT. STUDIO OFFICES - SAME TIME \nYoung SECRETARIES in June Cleaver hairdos are giggling. \nSECRETARY #1 They say he was a girl trapped in a man's body. \nSECRETARY #2 I'll bet it hurt when they snipped his thing off. \nEEWWW!  All the girls shriek in horror.  Ed walks in and puts down his plant. \nED What are you ladies gabbin' about? \nSECRETARY #1 You know that Christine Jorgensen freak?  He/she/it's in \"Variety.\" Some producer is making a biopic. \nED (startled) R-really?  I didn't see the story. \nSECRETARY #1 Ah, it was buried in the back.  The guy's a real small\u00f3time operator. \nShe holds up her \"Variety.\"  Ed hurriedly takes it. \nCUT TO: \nINSERT - VARIETY \nThe story headline says \"BOY\u00f3TO\u00f3CHICK FLICK TO CLICK.\"  We PULL OUT, revealing we're now in \nINT. ED'S APARTMENT - DAY \nEd holds the newspaper while he paces around his apartment. The place has threadbare carpet, faded wallpaper, and an electric burner for a kitchen.  A handful of mangy DOGS run around. Tacked-up are movie posters for \"DRACULA,\" \"FREAKS,\" and \"THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS.\" \nDolores talks on the phone, while Ed silently coaches her. \nDOLORES (on phone) Yes, I've got Mr. Edward Wood on the line.  Could you please hold? \nEd gives her a thumbs up -- perfect!  He confidently takes the phone. \n", "test1_id": 2751, "test2_input": "ED (O.S.) Yes! \nPAUL MARCO You're sure??? \nED (O.S.) YES!  JUST DO IT! \nWIDE VIEW \nStanding straight below is Tor.  The Swede has his arms outstretched, waiting. \nEd supervises a good distance away.  He motions to Paul. \nPaul gulps, then unties the octopus. \nIt drops incredibly fast.  The thing must weigh half a ton. \nTor's eyes widen. \nAnd the octopus smashes straight on top of him. \nBAM! \nTor is gone from sight.  One of the eight tentacles snaps off. \nUP IN THE CATWALK \nCriswell moans. \nCRISWELL Oh my God.  We killed him. \nON THE GROUND \nEd runs to the octopus and looks for Tor underneath. \nED Tor!  Are you okay?! \nA beat.  And then the octopus flips over.  Tor sits up, battered but smiling. \nTOR Bedder than wrestlink! \nEXT. REPUBLIC STUDIOS - NIGHT \nThe five men hurry across the lot, carrying the hubongous octopus on their shoulders. \nSuddenly, a FLASHLIGHT shines on them. \nANGRY VOICE Hey!  What are you doing?! \nThe men jump with fear.  They break into a fast waddling run. \nCRISWELL Thank God Tor broke the fence. \nThe team runs through the busted gate and escapes. \nEXT. STUDIOS - NIGHT \nThe Cadillac SCREECHES away.  The octopus flops on top of the five men. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT \nThe movie crew is setting up for a big night shoot.  Lights and generators are sprawled across this isolated area. \nTony McCoy perches goofily on his own personalized chair.  He runs lines by himself. \nTONY \"Now Janet, I want you staying away from the old Willows Place.\" \nThe octopus lays in a dried-up riverbed.  There's only about an inch of water.  Ed yells at Conrad. \nED You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a lake! \nCONRAD This is kind of a stream-- \nED NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER! \nEd storms away.  Conrad scratches his head. \nIN A DUSTY PARKING LOT \nBela sits inertly in the back of an open car.  He weakly hails over Ed. \nBELA Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot... \nED Nonsense!  You look great -- (suddenly he catches himself; he speaks more sincerely) Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while. \nED Thanks, buddy... \nEd smiles warmly, then walks off. \nBela stares after him, then absent-mindedly searches through his pockets.  Finally, he finds what he's looking for -- a rubber tube.  Bela looks to make sure no one's around, then ties the tube around his upper arm... \nAT THE SET - LATER \nCrew members have dammed up the end of the river, and Bunny fills it with a hose.  There is now a foot of water. \nEd stands at the shore, admiring it. \nED Hey.  This is looking good! (he turns to Paul) Paul, where's the octopus motor? \nPAUL MARCO What octopus motor? \nED You know, to make the legs move -- \nPAUL MARCO (defensive) Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling! \nBela stumbles up, with a dazed smile. \nBELA Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go? \nED You'll be fighting with the octopus. \nBELA Out there?! (he points at the water) What happened to the stream? \nED This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater. \nBELA Oh, for Christ's sake. \nBela rolls up his pants and wades out, into the water.  He screams. \nBELA Goddamn, it's cold! \n", "test2_true": "BELA Fuck you!  You come out here. (beat) Hey, toss me that J.D. \nA crew member throws Bela a bottle of Jack Daniels. \nBela pops the cap and chugs half the bottle in one swig.  He licks his lips, then climbs onto the octopus. \nBELA Okay!  How do we turn this thing on? \nED Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you. \nBela stares, deadpan. \nBELA Do you know I turned down \"Frankenstein\"? \nED Huh? \nBELA After I did \"Dracula,\" the studio offered me \"Frankenstein\"!  But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough.  It was too degrading for a big star like me. \nThe crew glances at Ed. \nED Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight. \nBELA Don't let me slow you down. \nED Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND! \nBela takes another swig of J.D., then throws it off-camera. \nED ACTION! \nBela starts flailing around the octopus legs and SCREAMING in horror.  This image is truly ridiculous. \nEd is pleased. \nSome crew members nod: Pretty good. \nED And CUT! \nEverybody cheers. \nThen suddenly the dam walls BURST. \nWHOOSH!  The water rushes from the lake and floods the park below. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. DINKY SOUNDSTAGES - EARLY MORNING \nCrew members straggle in for the final shoot.  Everybody looks bleary-eyed from last night.  Ed stands cheerily at the entrance, greeting them. \nED C'mon!  Just one more day!  Just have some coffee, you'll feel better! \nTony staggers up. \nTONY Mr. Wood, I only got one hour of sleep. \nED Yeah?  Well I got no sleep, and I feel great! \nEd sees Bela slowly shuffling along. Ed runs over to him. \nED Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night. \nBELA (exhausted) That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty. \nED No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning. \nBELA Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for... \nED (he smiles, then pulls out a script page) I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech. \nEd hands him the paper.  Bela starts reading it, as Ed watches anxiously.  Bela is very touched. \nBELA (still reading) Eddie, this is quite a scene. \nED I know it's a lot to give you at the last second. \nBela looks up. \nBELA These lines -- I'll have no problem remembering. \nWIPE TO: \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY \nThey are shooting.  Ed watches off-camera, as Bela acts a somber scene with an actor playing PROFESSOR STROWSKI, a threatening European. \nSTROWSKI \"Our government wants you to return... to continue your experiments there.  Where you can have everything at your disposal.\" \nBELA (as VORNOFF) \"My dear Professor Strowski, twenty years ago I was banned from my home land.  I was classed as a madman -- a charlatan -- outlawed in the world of science which previously honored me as a genius!\" (he gets very subdued) \"Now here in this forsaken jungle hell, I have proven that I am alright.\" \nSTROWSKI \"Yes, the authorities have learned how correct your findings were.  So I am here -- sent to bring you home.\" \nBELA (impassioned) \"Home.  I have no home.  Hunted... despised... living like an animal -- the jungle is my home!  But I will show the world that I can be its master.  I shall perfect my own race of people -- a race of atomic supermen that will conquer the world!\" \nIt's an incredible performance of crowning tragedy.  Bela is totally drained. \nCU - ED \nHe is very moved.  He whispers, barely audible. \nED Cut.  It's a wrap. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT \nThe wrap party is being thrown in the meat packing plant. People laugh and shout and carry on.  Tor pours booze in the punch.  R&B MUSIC plays.  Old Man McCoy dances with Loretta. Bunny dances with a young stud.  Dolores stands by herself. \nBela and Criswell are giggling. \nCRISWELL So you sleep in coffins?! \nBELA Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable. \nCRISWELL I can't believe this!  I sleep in coffins! \nBELA No. \nCRISWELL YES!  My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit! \n", "test2_id": 2752, "test3_input": "Ed nervously stands.  He starts to step forward -- when he catches his own reflection in a mirror.  He's still in drag. \nED Oh shit. \nEd rolls his eyes.  He runs his hand through his hair, then slowly approaches Orson Welles.  Ed is terrified. \nED Excuse me, Sir...? \nORSON WELLES (he casually looks up) Yes? \nED Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you. \nORSON WELLES (he extends his hand) My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles. \nED Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood! (he smiles anxiously) So, what are you working on now? \nORSON WELLES Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on \"Don Quixote.\" So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack -- (he shrugs) I think I left it in Malta. \nEd is astonished. \nED I can't believe it.  These sound like my problems! \nORSON WELLES It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think they're a director... \nED Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies -- \nORSON WELLES Ugh, I hate when that happens. \nED (on a roll) And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even matter if they're right for the part! \nORSON WELLES Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a Mexican! \nEd shakes his head.  He's discouraged. \nED Mr. Welles, is it all worth it? \nORSON WELLES It is when it works. (solemn) You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  \"Kane.\"  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame. (he smiles warmly) Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams? \nCLOSEUP - ED \nHe has seen God. \nED Wow. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY \nEd bursts onto the stage, a changed man.  Re-energized, he confidently grabs the Baptists. \nED Mr. Reynolds! \nREYNOLDS Yes? \nED We are gonna finish this film just the way I want it!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision! \nREVEREND LEMON (flustered) B-but it's our money -- \nED And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way! \nReynolds and Rev. Lemon are speechiess. \nCLOSEUP - ED \nHe beams, turns and SHOUTS TRIUMPHANTLY into the soundstage. \nED ALRIGHT!  ACTORS IN POSITION!  LET'S FINISH THIS PICTURE!! \nWIPE TO: \n\"PLAN 9\" MONTAGE: \nSCENE IN THE CEMETERY SET \nTor plays a zombie rising from the dead.  He wears the scary white contact lenses.  Tor's so big, he has trouble lifting himself from the grave. \nEDITING ROOM \nEd and his stock footage buddy watch a moviola. \nED Okay, I want that tank!  And I want that bomb! \nSOUNDSTAGE \nHarry paints Bunny's face GREEN, like a Martian.  Ed yells. \nED NO!  The aliens should look like people. \nMAKE-UP MAN HARRY I'm tellin' ya, aliens are always green. \nED Not in my movie, they're not! \nSCENE IN THE SPACESHIP SET \nBunny's make-up is now normal.  He wears an alien suit.  A HAMMY ALIEN enters and salutes with a bizarre crossing gesture. \nBUNNY \"What plan will we follow?\" \nHAMMY ALIEN \"Plan Nine.\" \nBUNNY \"Plan Nine...\" (he consults his papers) \"Ah yes.  Plan Nine deals with the resurrection of the dead.\" \nSCENE IN THE CEMETERY \nTor staggers up to Paul Marco and CLOBBERS him. \nOFF-STAGE \nEd smiles at the Baptists. \nED Maybe you guys were right.  \"Plan Nine\" is a good title. \nMINIATURE CITY SET \nEd shoots the famous flying saucers.  Paul holds a paper plate and Conrad lights it on fire. \nThe \"saucer\" soars on fishing line over a little miniature town. \nSCENE IN THE BEDROOM SET \nDr. Tom glides in, his cape over his face.  A woman SCREAMS. \n", "test3_true": "Ed stands in front of a masonite board and two chairs.  An actor playing the AIRPLANE PILOT walks up. \nPILOT Where's the cockpit set? \nED You're standing in it. (he yells off) Alright, bring in the shower curtain! \nA shower curtain gets lowered into the doorway. \nEXT. DUSTY ROAD \nA car zooms by.  Kathy drives, as Ed shoots handheld out the back window. \nSCENE IN THE SPACESHIP SET \nTh Hammy Alien argues with the humans. \nPILOT \"So what if we develop this solarnite bomb?  We'd be even a stronger nation.\" \nHAMMY ALIEN \"Stronger?  You see!  You see!!  Your stupid minds!  Stupid!  STUPID!\" \nPILOT \"That's all I'm taking from you.\" \nHe WHACKS the alien.  A brawl breaks out. \nSCENE WITH CRISWELL \nCriswell lectures behind a desk, with mysterious lighting \nCRISWELL \"Perhaps on your way home, someone will pass you in the dark, and you will never know it.  For they will be from outer space.\" \nSCENE IN THE CEMETERY SET \nThe famous shot: Tor and Vampira walk in a trance through foggy cemetery. \nOff-stage, Ed stands with the crew.  He shouts gleefully. \nED More fog!  More fog!! (he beams) And CUT!  PRINT IT!  IT'S A WRAP! \nEND MONTAGE. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY - NIGHT \nIt's pouring rain.  Standing in the drench is Ed.

She wears a pretty gown. \nED I can't get it to go up. \nKATHY Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere. \nED (he gives up) C'mon!  Let's just go. \nEd impulsively opens the car door.  Water pours out.  Kathy scurries out and jumps in the wet car with him. \nEXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT \nThe rain is gushing down.  The marquee proclaims \"WORLD PREMIERE: PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE!\" \nPeople hurry in.  Ed and Kathy roar up in the open convertible, totally soaked.  He jumps out, opens her door, and they run inside. \nINT. THEATER - NIGHT \nThe theater is packed.  All the gang, and their friends and families, are gathered. \nCriswell stands on-stage, speaking into a mike. \nCRISWELL You are about to see en extraordinary motion picture.  But before it begins, I think we ought to give a hand to the man without whom we wouldn't be here tonight... Eddie, take a bow! \nThe crowd ERUPTS in applause.  Everybody goes crazy -- even the Baptists.  People YELL \"Speech! Speech!\" \nEd smiles proudly.  Kathy kisses him.  Ed runs down front, hugs Criswell, then takes the microphone. \nED Thanks a million.  I just wanna say... this film is for Bela. \nThe lights dim. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMINUTES LATER \nThe title \"PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE\" is projected onto the screen.  As random IMAGES from the film play out, we drift over the happy faces of our friends watching. \nPaul and Conrad stare, enthralled. \nTor laughs as he sees himself. \nVampira giggles.  Bunny nudges her playfully. \nCriswell mouths his own lines. \nON SCREEN \nBela appears, in his little suit.  In the last footage he ever shot, he shuffles around in front of his house, then tenderly smells the flower. \nON ED \nHe watches, entranced.  Then he smiles to himself. \nED This is the one.  I know I'll be remembered for this film. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THEATER LOBBY - LATER \nThe BOISTEROUS crowd is in high spirits.  People congratulate Ed and pat him on the back.  \"It was great!\"  \"It's your best one yet!\"  \"Bela would've loved it!\" \nEd drifts through the crowd, basking in the glory.  It's like a wonderful dream. \nEXT. THEATER - SAME TIME \nThe rain comes down in sheets.

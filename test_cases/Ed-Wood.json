{"train": "\"Ed Wood\", by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski \nED WOOD \nby Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski \nDirected by Tim Burton \nFIRST DRAFT \nNovember 20, 1992 \nFADE IN: \nINT. HAUNTED MANSION PARLOR - NIGHT \nWe move through a spooky shrouded parlor, as a storm rages outside.  THUNDER roars, and lightning flashes in the giant windows.  in the center of the room lies an oak coffin. \nSuddenly the lid starts to creak open. A hand crawls past the edge... and then the lid slams up!  Famed psychic CRISWELL pops out.  Criswell, 40, peers at us intently, his gleaming eyes framed under his striking pale blonde hair.  He intones, with absolute conviction: \nCRISWELL Greetings, my friend.  You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable... that is why you are here. So now, for the first time, we are bringing you the full story of what happened... (extremely serious) We are giving you all the evidence, based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal.  The incidents, the places, my friend, we cannot keep this a secret any longer. Can your hearts stand the shocking facts of the true story of Edward D. Wood, Junior?? \nEXT. NIGHT SKY \nLightning CRACKS. \nWe drift down past the dark clouds... through the torrential rain... and end up... \nOPTICAL: \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT \nWe've landed in Hollywood, 1952.  We're outside a teeny, grungy playhouse.  The cracked marquee proclaims \"'THE CASUAL COMPANY,' WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY EDWARD D. WOOD, JR.\" \nPacing nervously in the rain is ED WOOD, 30, our hero. Larger-than-life charismatic, confident, Errol Flynn-style handsome, Ed is a human magnet.  He's a classically flawed optimist: Sweet and well-intentioned, yet doomed by his demons within. \nThe doors open, and Ed's pal JOHN \"BUNNY\" BRECKINRIDGE, 45, hurries out.  Bunny is a wealthy, theatrical fop wearing a string of pearls. \n[PAGE 2 MISSING] \nSuddenly the rest of the cast runs up, frantically upset.  In a flowing white dress is DOLORES FULLER, 23, a sharp, hungry- for-a-career ingenue.  She's near tears. \nDOLORES Eddie, my dove just flew out the window! \nCREW MEMBER She goes on in two minutes! What are we gonna do?? \nThey all look to Ed, awaiting a response.  He thinks a second, then excitedly CLAPS his hands. \nED Dolores, give me your shoes. \nDOLORES What? \nED The ghost can be barefoot.  Give me your shoes! \nShe hands Ed her white shoes.  He snatches one, grabs a pair of scissors, and starts CUTTING up the shoe.  Everyone is baffled. He keeps cutting the shoe... and it slowly takes on the shape of a dove! \nEd then grabs some pipe cleaners, works them into a shape, and sprints into the dressing room.  He takes some green eye shadow and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners.  Ed then hurries back out, jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut-up shoe... and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth! \nThe cast is flabbergasted. \nCREW MEMBER Wow. \nBACK ONSTAGE \nThe soldiers suddenly look up. \nACTOR #1 Hey, I think I see something! \nDolores floats down onto the stage, holding out the dove. \nDOLORES I offer you mortals the bird of peace, so that you may change your ways and end all this destruction. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCRUFFY COFFEE SHOP - LATER THAT NIGHT \nEd and his gang celebrate opening night in a dirty 24-hour diner.  They're noisily slugging down drinks, in a big red booth. \nED What a show!  Everyone was terrific! Paul, your second-act monologue actually gave me chills, \nHe grins at Actor #1, aka PAUL MARCO, a young eager beaver who's loyal like a dog. \nPAUL MARCO Aw thanks, Eddie. \nActor #2, aka CONRAD BROOKS, a friendly, simple-minded lug, runs up waving a newspaper. \nCONRAD I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand. \nED (he smiles at everyone) This is the big moment...! \nEd opens the paper to the entertainment page. \nINSERT - THE NEWSPAPER.  Ed turns to a column, \"The Theatrical Life, By Victor Crowley.\"  Under this is a photograph of an old man with an ascot. \nWIDE \nEverybody excitedly crowds around and starts reading.   A moment... and then their faces drop.  Clearly, this is a disastrous review.  Their faces get sadder, and sadder... and then they finish.  A melancholy beat, until -- \nBUNNY What does that old queen know?  He wasn't even there! (he knocks back a drink) Sending a copy boy to do his dirty work.  Well fuck him! \nDOLORES Do I really have a face like a horse? \nPAUL MARCO What does \"ostentatious\" mean? \nEd calmly waves his arms for attention.  He tries to smile. \nED Hey.  Hey, it's not that bad.  You just can't concentrate on the negative.  He's got some nice things to say... (he scans the review) See, \"The soldier costumes are very realistic.\"  That's positive! \nEveryone kind of stares at their drinks, depressed.  Ed launches into an upbeat speech. \nED Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last \"Francis the Mule\" picture -- it got terrible notices.  But it was a huge hit. \nPAUL MARCO Lines around the block. \nED So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work. \nCONRAD You really think so? \nED Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous. \nHe smiles at everyone at the table.  They all believe what he says, and there is a hushed moment of dream-filled hope. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ED'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCU on a ROYAL TYPEWRITER.  Ed's hands whirl across the portable typewriter, frantically feeding in pages as fast as be can type.  We PULL OUT. \nEd sits on the bed, typing.  He's a blur of activity, juggling a cigarette, coffee, and a telephone, while he writes. \nED (on phone) But Bunny, you're perfect for this job!  You're so good at organizing. \nHis adrenalin is pumping.  Ed pours some booze into his coffee. \nED You know these people.  I need all the transsexuals and transvestites you can get. (he sucks on his cigarette) No, I don't care if they're not actors.  I want realism.  I want this film to tell the truth!  I've waited my whole life for this shot, and I'm not gonna blow it. \nThere's a KNOCK at the door.  Ed carries the phone on a long cord and answers it.  Bela hurries in, smiling broadly. \nBELA Eddie, you got a new movie for me?! \nED Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character! (back into the phone) Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  I need transvestites! \nEd hangs up and resumes typing.  Bela is puzzled. \nBELA Eddie, what kind of movie is this? \nED Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside. \nBELA (delighted) Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production. \nEd stops typing.  He pours Bela a drink. \nED Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything. \nBELA I don't understand. \nED Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster. \nBELA (getting it) Ah, so I pull the strings! \nED Yeah.  You pull the strings -- (he suddenly gets a look) \"Pull the strings\"... hey, that's pretty good! \nEd quickly starts typing again. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nEd and Dolores sit at a card table, finishing up dinner.  The dogs eat scraps below them. \nED Wipe off your hands.  I've got a little surprise for you... (he smiles nervously) I finished my script. \nEd anxiously pulls out a pile of pages.  Dolores looks in awe at the cover: \"'GLEN OR GLENDA' By Edward D. Wood, Jr\"\" \nDOLORES Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home. \nED (apprehensive) Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait... \nThere's an uneasy moment between them.  She senses something funny.  Dolores takes the script and goes into the bedroom. The door closes.  Ed starts pacing... \nDISSOLVE TO: INT. BEDROOM - LATER \nDolores reads the script.  She finishes the last page, then looks up.  She is very shaken. \nDolores stands.  She grabs the door and opens it. \nTHROUGH THE DOORWAY \nEd stands somberly in drag.  He's in a pantsuit, heels, and pink angora sweater. \nDolores is totally rattled.  She struggles for a response. \nDOLORES So that's where my sweater's been. \nEd silently nods. \nDOLORES How long have you been doing this? \nED Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit. \nDOLORES Jesus Christ!  And you never told me? \nED This is my way of telling you -- \nDOLORES (furious) What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that? \nEd is terribly hurt.  Dolores shakes tht script. \nDOLORES And what about this so-called \"Barbara\" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is our life! \nED (quiet) Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part. \nDOLORES Oh!  You got nerve, buddy. \nHe calmly points at the script. \nED It's a damn good role. \nDOLORES That's not the issue!! (she suddenly stops) Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?! \nED It takes me comfortable. \nDOLORES Oh, just like in the script! \nEd smiles serenely. \nED Exactly. (he takes her hand) So what do ya say?  Do you wanna break up... or do you wanna do the movie with me? \nDolores sighs. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCREEN CLASSICS - DAY \nThe hallway is filled with eager TRANSVESTITES.  It's a very festive atmosphere, and Bunny tries to create some order. \nInside the busy office, Paul types, and Conrad cranks a mimeograph machine. \nCONRAD It's good to have a job.  Now I can get my phone reconnected. \nIn a corner, Georgie angrily waves the script at Ed. \nGEORGIE I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film! \nEd runs up, bounding with enthusiasm. \nED Bela! It's so great to see you! (he glances at his watch) And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time! \nBELA I am always on time. \nED Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment -- \nBELA (he leans in and WHISPERS) Uh, Eddie, do you have my money? \nED Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course. \nEd and Bela step over to a corner. \nACROSS THE ROOM \nFrom a distance, Ed pulls a wad of money from his pocket and peels off a few bills for Bela.  The crew watches, fascinated. \nWIPE TO: \nLATER \nBela is seated in the ratty armchair on the set.  Harry does his make-up.  Harry glances at Bela's arm, and it is full of TRACK MARKS.  Harry grimaces, but doesn't say anything. \nConrad eagerly scurries up. \nCONRAD Mr. Lugosi, I know you're very busy, but could I have your autograph? \nBELA (cordial) Of course. \nConrad hands him a scrap of paper.  Bela signs it. \nCONRAD You know which movie of yours I love, Mr. Lugosi?  \"The Invisible Ray.\" You were great as Karloff's sidekick. \nBela's face suddenly hardens.  He snaps. \nBELA \"Sidekick\"??  \"KARLOFF\"?!! \nBela insanely RIPS up the autograph. \nBELA Fuck you!!  Karloff doesn't deserve to smell my shit!  That limey cocksucker can rot in hell, for all I care!!! \nWIDE \nEd panickedly runs up. \nED What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do? \nCONRAD (upset, close to crying) Nothin'!  I told him he was great. \nBELA How dare that asshole bring up Karloff?!!  You think it takes talent to play Frankenstein?!  NO!  It's just make-up and grunting!  GRRR! GRRR!  GRRR! \nEd is frozen in fear.  He glances across the stage. \nGeorgie is flabbergasted.  He points urgently at his watch. \nEd nods.  He motions to Conrad: Get out of here.  Conrad runs away.  Ed leans in to Bela. \nED You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, that's a part that takes acting. \nBELA Of course!  Dracula requires presence.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand -- \nBela waves his outstretched arm.  Ed tries to calm him. \nED Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene? \nBELA BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!! \nThe crew is baffled.  Ed shrugs at them. \nED Um, okay... roll camera \nCAMERAMAN BILL (unsure) Rolling. \nED Sound! \nSOUNDMAN Speed. \nCAMERA ASSISTANT Mark.  Scene Thirty-One. \nThe Assistant CLAPS the slate in front of Bela, then runs. \nED And... action? \nIt's dead quiet.  Nobody knows what's about to happen. \nWE MOVE IN TO BELA.  And... he suddenly assumes character. Like the consumate pro he is.  Bela gets a wicked, sinister leer, then starts intoning threateningly: \nBELA (as the SPIRIT) \"Beware.  Beware!  Beware, of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep.  He eats little boys! Puppy dog tails!  Big fat snails! Beware.  Take care.  Beware!\" \nCLOSEUP - ED \nHe is blown away.  He quietly mumbles in amazement. \nED Brilliant. \nWIPE TO: \nINT. STAGE - NEXT DAY \nDolores studies her script, as the crew lights a flimsy kitchen set.  Ed strolls past, nonchalantly removing a ladies' wig and earrings.  She stares in disbelief. \nDOLORES How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people? \nED Hon', nobody's bothered but you. (he gestures) Look around -- they couldn't care less. \nDOLORES Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS! \nED Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer. \nDolores quiets down.  She feels bad. \nED Dolores.  I need your help... \nWIPE TO: \nFILMING IN PROGRESS - LATER \nA scene is being shot, on camera.  Ed (as Glen) and Dolores (as Barbara) stare into each other's eyes.  He's dressed normal, and she wears a fuzzy angora sweater. \nED (as GLEN) \"My mind's in a muddle.  I thought I could stop wearing these things. I tried, honestly I tried...\" \nIt's a warm moment.  They all CLINK their glasses. \nDolores kisses Ed. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BUNGALOW HOUSE - DAY \nWe're outside a cute little Spanish bungalow house.  Ed and Dolores are moving in.  They lug furniture from a rented truck. \nED From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did. \nDOLORES I don't know.  It's so much money... \nED Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab. \nDOLORES But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job. \nED But you do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me! \nShe just stares.  Ed shrugs, semi-reassuringly. \nED Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do? \nDOLORES Toss us out on our ass. \nED Exactly. \nINT. BUNGALOW - DAY \nThe house is moved in.  Ed's unkempt dogs run about.  Pumped-up Ed sits on the bed typing fiendishly fast while wearing an angora sweater.  A cigarette dangles from his mouth, and a bottle of booze lays in his lap.  Bela sits quietly nearby. \nED How 'bout a western?  People love westerns. \nBELA But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one? \nED Eh, forget it.  What else is big? (his face lights up) Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks -- \nBELA Who do I play? \nED Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's angry!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his daughter behave this way! \nBELA (cautious, not to offend) Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl... \nEd considers this. \nED Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once \"Glen Or Glenda\" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another! \nBELA (he smiles) That's good.  I could use the money. \nED But we need to start off with a bang! Something we know the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit? \nBELA (he thinks) Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be \"Dracula.\" \nED Of course! \nEd crabs a pen and excitedly scrawls out the word \"DRACULA.\" Bela frowns. \nBELA Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day. \nED So let's make another \"Dracula.\" Let's make \"The Return of Dracula\"! \nBELA We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights. \nED They do?  Shoot.  There must be a way to get around that... \nEd's mind is working.  He holds out the paper and stares at it.  Suddenly, he grins.  He grabs the pen and makes a period after the \"DR.\"  It now says \"DR.ACULA\" \nED Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula! \nBELA Dracula? \nED No!  Doctor Acula!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count. \nBELA Ah!  This is very exciting. \nED (inspired) I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh! \nEd rips the paper from his typewriter, puts in a blank page, and starts typing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOVIE STUDIO GATE - DAY \nWe're outside the imposing gates of MGM.  The lion logo is overhead.  Ed drives up in his dirty Nash Rambler convertible. He wears his nicest suit.  Ed peers nervously at the GUARD. \nED Excuse me, I'm here to see Mr. Feldman. \nThe Guard stares suspiciously at Ed.  His filthy car is leaking oil. \nGUARD What's your name? \nED Edward D. Wood, Junior. \nThe man frowns.  He looks through his files -- then finds a parking slip with Ed's name.  He is surprised. \nGUARD Oh.  Eh, he's in the Executive Building.  You can park in the reserved section. \nEd smiles. \nINT. EXECUTIVE WAITING ROOM - DAY \nThe room is very posh, with fancy paneling and marble floors. Ed sits nervously under posters for \"GRAND HOTEL\" and \"QUO VADIS.\"  Film cans labled \"Glen Or Glenda\" rest in his lap. \nSECRETARY Sir, Mr. Feldman will see you now. \nShe hits an electric button.  A large oak door swings open. \nINT. OFFICE \nBehind a giant desk is MR. FELDMAN, a glib, thin over- caffeinated man.  He jumps up, smiling. \nMR. FELDMAN Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you. \nED (shaking his hand) It's Wood.  Ed Wood. \nMR. FELDMAN Wood?  Ward?  Wood. (puzzled, he glances at his appointment book) Hey, what do you know.  It is Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right? \nEd shrugs.  Feldman grins. \nMR. FELDMAN So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans. \nThe crowd suddenly ROARS and jumps up.  A favorite wrestler has entered the ring, massive TOR JOHNSON, 50.  Tor is an incredible sight: A bald, lumbering behemoth. \nRING ANNOUNCER (amplified) Now entering the ring, in the gold trunks, 350 bone-crunching pounds of pure strength, the \"Swedish Angel\"... Tor Johnson!!! \nThe crowd goes apeshit.  The stands are going to collapse from the SHOUTING. \nEd's eyes are the size of saucers. \nED My God, look at that guy.  He's a mountain! \nThe bell RINGS.  Tor quickly grabs his OPPONENT, a man in a blue mask, and throws him at the ground.  Then Tor jumps onto his stomach, easily picks him up, and heaves him at the ropes. \nPeople CHEER.  Ed is flabbergasted. \nED I've never seen anything like him! \nBUNNY And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married -- \nED (eyes glued to the ring) Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a monster! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie? \nON TOR \nHe screams maniacally in Swedish.  Tor lifts the Opponent over his head and tosses him into the stands.  Three rows of chairs get knocked over. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WRESTLER'S BAR - NIGHT \nA tiny miniature European car pulls up.  Tor Johnson is squeezed inside -- ludicrously oversized for this vehicle.  Tor carefully wedges himself out and enters the bar. \nINT. WRESTLER'S BAR - SAME TIME \nThis rowdy bar is packed with burly WRESTLERS.  Tor walks in, and men cheerily yell out: \"Hey, Tor!\" \"Hi, Tor!\"  Tor grins. In person, he actually seems a jolly, outgoing fellow. \nEd waves from the corner \nED Mr. Johnson, over here! \nTor smiles and lumbers over \nED Glad you could fit me in your schedule. \nTOR (in a hoarse SWEDISH ACCENT) Da pleasure be mine. \nThey shake hands.  Ed's hands look like a baby's in Tor's giant mitts. \nTor tries to sit in the booth.  But he can't fit. \nTOR Could we moovf to table? \nED Oh, of course! \nEd jumps up.  They move to a large table.  Now Tor is happy. He starts shoveling beer nuts into his mouth. \nED So, Mr. Johnson -- \nTOR Tor! \nED Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor? \nTOR (he CHUCKLES) Mm, not good-lookink enough. \nED I think you're quite handsome. \nTOR No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that. \nEd smiles. \nED Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures. \nTOR But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent. \nED Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium. \nA WAITRESS saunters over. \nWAITRESS Tor, what can I get ya? \nTOR I'll haf eight beers. \nWAITRESS (nonchalant, to Ed) And you? \nED Uhh, I'll have just one. \nShe walks off.  Tor shakes the now-empty nut bowl. \nTOR And more nuts! \nEd tries to grab Tor's attention. \nED So anyway, I've got this new script, \"Bride Of The Atom,\" and there's a part you're ideal for: \"Lobo.\"  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl. \nTOR (he laughs merrily) I like.  When do movie shoot? \nED Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ED'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nEd and Dolores are asleep.  Suddenly the phone RINGS.  Ed fumbles for it and groggily answers. \nED Wood Productions... \nWe hear Bela's weak VOICE. \nBELA (on phone) Eddie... help me... \nED Bela? \nBELA (on phone) Eddie... please come over -- \nCLICK.  The phone hangs up.  Ed is very alarmed. \nEXT. BELA'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT \nThe wind is blowing.  Ed's Nash roars up, and he jumps out, a coat over his pajamas.  He runs up and POUNDS on Bela's door. \nED Bela?! \nEd tries the door. It's unlocked. \nCRISWELL In 1960, the automobile will have retractable wings, so it can fly. \nHOST Sounds like a heck of a way to beat traffic. \nAudience LAUGHS.  Criswell rubs his temples enigmatically. \nCRISWELL By 1970, Man will have colonized Mars.  Millions of people will live there. \nEd is mesmerized. \nED Wow!  Ain't that something. \nINT. STUDIO - LATER \nWe're out in the audience.  The curtain rises on a SPOOKY SET: Shadows, cobwebs, and a coffin in the center.  The Host walks onstage, to huge APPLAUSE.  He's playing his \"Slick\" character, a befuddled moron in a funny hat.  The Host shines a flashlight around, and then the coffin opens.  Bela sits up.  There's more APPLAUSE. \nBELA Greetings.  I am the Count. \nHOST Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure. \nThe audience LAUGHS.  Then APPLAUSE. \nHOST Say, that's a funny place to sleep. \nBELA It is my home. \nHOST Oh, tract housing, huh? (he starts AD-LIBBING) I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy shower.  I still don't know where to hang the towels! \nThe audience HOWLS with laughter.  Bela is totally lost.  He seems incredibly confused. \nBELA Uh, beg to differ. \nHOST \"Beg to differ?!\"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank! \nBELA (terrified, groping) Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count... \nBACKSTAGE \nEd covers his face in embarrassment. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STUDIO HALLWAY - LATER \nThe Host angrily storms past. \nHOST I told you we should've gotten Karloff. \nHe exits.  A door opens, and Ed and Bela quietly step out. \nED Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap. \nBELA (distraught) I never said I could ad-lib... \nED Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again. \nThey shuffle away... until Criswell and his snazzy ENTOURAGE burst around a corner.  Even in person, Criswell is ethereal and quite self-important.  He is delighted to see Bela. \nCRISWELL Mr. Lugosi!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL! \nBELA (morose) It's a pleasure... \nCRISWELL Ah, cheer up!   Don't lose heart over what happened tonight. (he points at his temple) I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success! \nED Wow. \nCRISWELL And who may you be? \nED Edward Wood, Sir. \nCRISWELL Ah.  The director of \"Glen Or Glenda.\" \nED (startled) H-how'd you know?! \nCRISWELL I'm Criswell.  I know all. \nCriswell winks. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MOCAMBO ROOM - NIGHT \nLatin horns blast onstage of this hopping '5Os nightclub. Cigarette girls roam about.  Seated at a front table is Ed, Bela, and Criswell's group.  Everyone's plastered and laughing. Criswell shouts above the din at a WAITER. \nCRISWELL Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine? \nBELA No.  I never drink -- wine. \nThe whole table CRACKS UP.  Bela cheers up.  Ed turns to Criswell. \nED Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even \nCRISWELL I guessed. \nED I don't understand. \nCRISWELL I made it up.  It's horseshit! \nEd's jaw drops. \nCRISWELL There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo. \nED It's that easy? \nCRISWELL Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything. \nCriswell smiles knowingly.  Ed nods at this profound wisdom. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT \nWe're outside the legendary hat-shaped restaurant.  A large Eldorado pulls up, and a CONSERVATIVE MAN and his PLUMP WIFE step out and approach the DOORMAN. \nCONSERVATIVE MAN Excuse me.  We're here for the Wood party. \nDOORMAN Ah, that would be in the Venetian Room, sir. \nThe couple raise their eyebrows.  They're impressed. \nINT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT \nED I understand you just moved here? \nLORETTA Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting. \nA WAITER walks over, with a water pitcher. \nWAITER Water, Ma'am? \nLORETTA (suddenly freaking out) No!  No water!  NO LIQUIDS!  I'm terribly allergic to them! \nThe waiter is bewildered.  He hurries away.  Ed leans in. \nED So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture. \nLORETTA Perhaps a small amount of money. (she smiles) How much do one of your motion pictures cost? \nED For this one, we need $60,000. \nLORETTA That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture. \nEd perks up.  She's a live one! \nEd pulls a script from his briefcase and hands it to her. \nED Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay. \nLORETTA Oh my, this is very interesting. (she skims the pages) Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts? \nED (very enthused) Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk! \nLORETTA Hmm.  Those sound kind of small. (stopping at a page) Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her. \nEd blanches. \nED J-Janet Lawton??? \nLORETIA Yes, Janet Layton is clearly the part to play.  She's got some real meaty scenes!  Can't you just see me in that part?? \nCU - ED \nHe is aghast.  What a stomach-churning decision.  He stares at Loretta, then slowly croaks a response. \nED Uh... yeah... (beat) You'd be perfect. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ED AND DOLORES'S HOUSE - DAY \nWe HEAR dishes being violently thrown.  Dolores SCREAMS inside. \nDOLORES (o.s.) You bastard!  You two-timing, dress-wearing son-of-a-BITCH!! \nINT. HOUSE - SAME TIME \nDolores is crying and screaming angrily.  Ed ducks the objects she hurls at him. \nED It was the only way I could get the movie made! \nDOLORES Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?! \nED I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say? \nDOLORES I wanted you to say, \"No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores.\" \nED But there's plenty of other parts. \nDOLORES Like what?! \nED (nervous) The secretary.  Or the file clerk. \nDolores is stunned. \nDOLORES YOU ASSHOLE! \nShe hurls a pot at Ed.  WHACK!  It slams him in the head. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY \nThe sets are being erected for \"Bride Of The Atom\"!  The crew hurries about the small stage, as Ed energetically supervises. He has a large band-aid on his head. \nED This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes! \nBUNNY You mean a Tesla coil? \nED If you say so. \nTor lumbers over, in his ripped Lobo outfit.  His face has fake gashed-up scars.  Tor holds the script. \nTOR Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like. \nED Really?  Was the third act too intense? \nTOR (trying to be polite) No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk. \nED But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed. \nTOR Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk. \nEd thinks.  He quickly puts a spin on this. \nED Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face. \nTOR (still bothered) But Greta say -- \nLoretta walks over, holding two dresses. \nLORETTA Eddie, which dress do you like better? \nED I don't know. (he yells o.s.) Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one? \nCameraman Bill is standing at the camera.  He squints. \nCAMERAMAN BILL Which one is the red one? \nED (confused) What do you mean? \nCAMERAMAN BILL I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind. (beat) But I like the dark gray one. \nWIPE TO: \nOLD MAN McCOY Son, you're too vague.  I come from the world of business.  I need to know what I get for my investment. \nED Movies are very popular.  You could make a lot of money. \nOLD MAN McCOY Yeah, but most of 'em flop, don't they?  What am I tangibly guaranteed? \nED Well... you get \"Executive Producer\" credit. \nOLD MAN McCOY That don't mean diddley. (he suddenly SHOUTS angrily) BILLY BOB!  You're cutting 'em TOO LEAN. \nMcCoy grabs a CLEAVER from a worker and slams it into a chop. \nED Mr. McCoy, how can I make you happy? \nOLD MAN McCOY Cut to the chase, heh?  That's good! That's very good. \nMcCoy SPITS his tobacco. \nOLD MAN McCOY Okay, two things.  Number one: I want the movie to end with a big explosion.  Sky full of smoke. \nED But the story ends with Dr. Vornoff falling in the pit -- \nOLD MAN McCOY Not anymore.  And number two: I've got a son.  He's a little slow -- but a good boy.  And something tells me he'd make a hell of a leading man... \nUnder Ed's cheery frozen smile, his face clearly falls. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SALT LAKE CITY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT \nWe're at a ROWDY wrestling match.  Tor Johnson is in the middle of a screaming, four-man tag-team event.  Tor THROWS his opponent to the ground; then tags with his partner and goes to the corner. \nSuddenly a WRESTLING COACH runs up, dragging a telephone on a very long cord. \nWRESTLING COACH Tor, you got a phone call! \nTOR Heh?  NOW? \nWRESTLING COACH They said it was an emergency! \nHe hands sweaty Tor the phone.  Tor speaks into it. \nTOR Hallo? \nED'S VOICE Tor, this is Ed!  Glad I could find you!  I got the money, and we resume shooting tomorrow morning! \nTOR But I'm in Utah. \nED'S VOICE Then you'll have to drive all night! I'm counting on you, big guy. Breakfast is at seven. \nCLICK.  Ed hangs up.  Tor is flabbergasted. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE - EARLY MORNING \n\"Bride Of The Atom\" is back in production!  Ed's stock company is reunited.  People drink coffee and gossip. \nPAUL MARCO This is unbelievable!  I woulda bet a million bucks that Ed wouldn't finish this picture. \nCAMERAMAN BILL It ain't finished yet.  Anything could happen. \nThe stage door opens and standing there, in silhouette, is Dolores.  Everybody quiets.  People glance nervously at Loretta. \nBUNNY Uh-oh.  Stay out of scratching distance. \nAT DOLORES \nEd runs over.  Dolores is beautifully made-up, and wearing a furry angora sweater.  Ed speaks, awkwardly. \nED Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message. \nDOLORES (icy) Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene. \nED That's right... \nDOLORES I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here. (she looks around) Say, who's the lug? \nIn a corner, standing by himself, is dumb TONY McCOY, Old Man McCoy's worthless son.  He's a good-looking, moody hunk.  Tony is practicing his lines from a script, but he's terribly stiff. \nTONY \"Now Janet, I want you straying away -- oops -- staying away from the old Willows Place.\" \nEd shrugs. \nED That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig. \nDOLORES Oh really?  How much money did he put up? \nED None. (beat) But his dad gave me fifty grand. \nDOLORES (snide) Wood Productions.  The mark of quality. \nED Hey, the movie's getting made. That's the main thing. \nDolores shakes her head contemptuously.  Then she strides off. \nEd stands alone, feeling bad. \nWIPE TO: \nON STAGE \nThe set is a one-wall \"office hallway\": A doorway and a water cooler.  Loretta sits in a make-up chair, as Harry works on her. \nDOLORES (O.S.) Hey Harry -- long time no see. \nHarry turns, surprised.  Dolores stands behind him.  There's a thick tension.  He smiles anxiously. \nMAKE-UP MAN HARRY Hi Dolores... \nLORETA Oh, you're Dolores?!  I've heard so much about you!  I'm Loretta King. (she chipperly jumps up) Here, take the chair. \nDOLORES (bitchy) Don't be silly -- let Harry finish. You still need more work. \nLORETTA No, I'm done.  All I needed was a touch-up. \nDOLORES Mm, that mole still shows. \nLoretta frowns.  Ed quickly steps in. \nED Ladies!  You both look fine.  Why don't we talk about the scene? (beat) Okay.  Janet Lawton has discovered that Dr. Vornoff bought the old Willows estate.  So now she wants to prove that all the monster stories are true. \nED (O.S.) Yes! \nPAUL MARCO You're sure??? \nED (O.S.) YES!  JUST DO IT! \nWIDE VIEW \nStanding straight below is Tor.  The Swede has his arms outstretched, waiting. \nEd supervises a good distance away.  He motions to Paul. \nPaul gulps, then unties the octopus. \nIt drops incredibly fast.  The thing must weigh half a ton. \nTor's eyes widen. \nAnd the octopus smashes straight on top of him. \nBAM! \nTor is gone from sight.  One of the eight tentacles snaps off. \nUP IN THE CATWALK \nCriswell moans. \nCRISWELL Oh my God.  We killed him. \nON THE GROUND \nEd runs to the octopus and looks for Tor underneath. \nED Tor!  Are you okay?! \nA beat.  And then the octopus flips over.  Tor sits up, battered but smiling. \nTOR Bedder than wrestlink! \nEXT. REPUBLIC STUDIOS - NIGHT \nThe five men hurry across the lot, carrying the hubongous octopus on their shoulders. \nSuddenly, a FLASHLIGHT shines on them. \nANGRY VOICE Hey!  What are you doing?! \nThe men jump with fear.  They break into a fast waddling run. \nCRISWELL Thank God Tor broke the fence. \nThe team runs through the busted gate and escapes. \nEXT. STUDIOS - NIGHT \nThe Cadillac SCREECHES away.  The octopus flops on top of the five men. \nWIPE TO: \nEXT. GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT \nThe movie crew is setting up for a big night shoot.  Lights and generators are sprawled across this isolated area. \nTony McCoy perches goofily on his own personalized chair.  He runs lines by himself. \nTONY \"Now Janet, I want you staying away from the old Willows Place.\" \nThe octopus lays in a dried-up riverbed.  There's only about an inch of water.  Ed yells at Conrad. \nED You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a lake! \nCONRAD This is kind of a stream-- \nED NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER! \nEd storms away.  Conrad scratches his head. \nIN A DUSTY PARKING LOT \nBela sits inertly in the back of an open car.  He weakly hails over Ed. \nBELA Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot... \nED Nonsense!  You look great -- (suddenly he catches himself; he speaks more sincerely) Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while. \nED Thanks, buddy... \nEd smiles warmly, then walks off. \nBela stares after him, then absent-mindedly searches through his pockets.  Finally, he finds what he's looking for -- a rubber tube.  Bela looks to make sure no one's around, then ties the tube around his upper arm... \nAT THE SET - LATER \nCrew members have dammed up the end of the river, and Bunny fills it with a hose.  There is now a foot of water. \nEd stands at the shore, admiring it. \nED Hey.  This is looking good! (he turns to Paul) Paul, where's the octopus motor? \nPAUL MARCO What octopus motor? \nED You know, to make the legs move -- \nPAUL MARCO (defensive) Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling! \nBela stumbles up, with a dazed smile. \nBELA Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go? \nED You'll be fighting with the octopus. \nBELA Out there?! (he points at the water) What happened to the stream? \nED This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater. \nBELA Oh, for Christ's sake. \nBela rolls up his pants and wades out, into the water.  He screams. \nBELA Goddamn, it's cold! \nThey CLINK beers. \nEXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - SAME TIME \nOutside, Vampira and two GIRL FRIENDS walk up.  They peer at a tin sign. \nGIRLFRIEND #1 \"McCoy Meat Packing\"?  Are you sure there's a party here? \nVAMPIRA (holding an INVITATION) Yeah, I got this invitation.  It's a \"Bride Of The Atom\" party, whatever that means. \nThey open the large steel door, and INSIDE is the wild bash. \nINT. PARTY \nAcross the room, Paul and Conrad chat. \nPAUL MARCO \"Glen Or Glenda,\" now that was a hell of a picture. \nCONRAD Well, this new one's gonna be a hundred times better. \nPAUL MARCO Is that possible? \nDolores overhears this.  She stares in disbelief. \nAT THE TURNTABLE \nSomeone changes the record.  Brassy STRIPPER MUSIC begins. \nA door opens, and Ed struts out, in full gaudy drag. \nEverybody turns.  They start WHISTLING and HOLLARING. \nEd grins, and starts into a wacky bump-and-grind. \nVOICE Go, baby, go! \nBunny runs up and sticks a dollar bill between Ed's fake tits. People LAUGH hysterically. \nDolores is appalled. \nEd shimmies to the music, blowing kisses all around.  He sees Vampira and waves. \nVampira's jaw drops in recognition. \nVAMPIRA I don't believe it.  It's him! \nEd sashays up to Bela and dances a few steps with him.  The music is building to a climax.  Ed hurries off to center stage -- and as the MUSIC ENDS, he does a final swing of his hips, then suddenly yanks out his teeth! \nThis brings down the house.  Everyone STAMPS their feet and CLAPS crazily. \nANGLE - DOLORES \nEveryone, except Dolores.  Suddenly, she explodes. \nDOLORES You people are INSANE!  Take a look around -- you're all FREAKS! \nThe room quiets.  Dolores has snapped. \nDOLORES You're wasting your lives making SHIT!  Nobody cares!  These movies are TERRIBLE! (beat) I can't take it any longer! \nThe group is shocked.  Nobody speaks. \nDolores runs out of the party. \nEd just stands, dumbstruck.  Then he chases after her, in his high heels and dress. \nEXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - SAME TIME \nDolores runs across the parking lot, in tears.  Ed catches up with her. \nED Dolores, wait! \nDOLORES Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life. \nED (hurt) Did you really mean those things you said..? \nDolores stops. \nDOLORES I'm tired of living on the fringe. \nED But you used to say -- \nDOLORES Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie. (pause) Now that it's done, so am I. \nShe turns and walks away.  Ed is crushed.  He stands motionless, in his dress, in the dark. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ED'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY \nEd's new home is a single apartment, still filled with moving boxes.  Half-eaten plates of food are scattered about.  Ed lies asleep in bed, unshaven, in the middle of the day. \nThe phone RINGS.  Ed awakens and woozily answers it. \nED Yeah... \nTOR (on phone) Ed, dit I wake you?  It's two in avternoon. \nED No, I was just doin' a little work... \nTOR (on phone) Bullchit!  You been like dis too many days.  I want to cheer you up. \nEXT. TOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nEd drives his Nash though a tract Valley neighborhood and reaches Tor's little house.  Ed gets out, still looking groggy. He walks up the tulip-lined path and rings the DOORBELL. Clanging SWEDISH CHIMES bong inside. \nThe door flies open, and Tor appears, beaming. \nTOR Edvard, you come! \nTor gives Ed a back-breaking hug. \nINT. TOR'S HOUSE - SAME TIME \nEd steps in.  The house is filled with cuckoo clocks and little Swedish knick-knacks.  Tor gestures proudly. \nTOR I'm so happy you visit.  Meet my family!  Greta, Karl, and Connie! \nTHREE COLOSSAL PEOPLE lumber out.  Tor has the largest family we've ever seen.  Not fat -- but big-boned.  GRETA is Tor's gigantic Swedish wife, and KARL and CONNIE are their two elephantine children.  They ADLIB greetings: \"Hallo!\" \"Welcome!\" \"Is a pleasure!\" \nEd cannot believe what he's seeing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nEd shuffles down the street, Mr. Lonely Guy, feeling sorry for himself. \nHe glances in a coffee shop, and sees a sweet young woman inside.  Her name is NORMA McCARTY.  She wears a bow in her hair, Mary Jane shoes, and a fuzzy white angora sweater. \nEd's eyes widen. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - SAME TIME \nInnocent Norma sits by herself, eating. \nED'S VOICE Excuse me.  Is that angora? \nNorma looks up.  Standing over her is Ed, smiling. \nNORMA Why... yes. \nED Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing? \nNORMA I suppose.  It's very expensive. \nED It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas. \nNORMA What are you, an angora wholesaler? \nED No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer. \nNORMA (she laughs) Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that. \nED Two people do.  Orson Welles and me. \nNORMA Wow. \nED You know, you're a very attractive girl. \nNorma blushes. \nNORMA My goodness, you're embarrassing me. \nED You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth. (he smoothly sits down) Mind if I order some hotcakes...? \nCUT TO: \nINT. CRISWELL'S CADILLAC - NIGHT \nCriswell and Paul drive at night.  They're dressed-up.  SWING MUSIC plays on the radio. \nCRISWELL So who's the surprise for? \nPAUL MARCO I dunno.  Ed was real mysterious. All he'd say was it's a surprise party. \nCRISWELL Isn't that like him! (beat) And isn't that like us -- that we show up anyway. \nThey pull up to a GUARD GATE.  They're at a studio. \nCRISWELL Excuse me.  We're here for the Wood party. \nGUARD They've rented Stage 12.  Drive straight back. \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT \nThere is another rambunctious party in progress.  Crepe paper streamers hang down.  Bela approaches Tor. \nBELA So what are we doing here? \nTOR Nobody knows.  But there's a lotta booze. \nSuddenly Ed steps into the middle of the room.  He's extremely handsome in his tuxedo, and beaming happily. \nED Excuse me!  Could everyone please quiet down? (the room quiets) First of all, I want to thank you, all my good friends, for being here tonight.  And second, if you're wondering what the big surprise is... well, TONIGHT I'M GETTING MARRIED!! \nThe crowd is stunned. \nMany people DROP their glasses. \nEd proudly pulls out Norma.  She's in a wedding gown. \nED Everybody, this is Norma! \nON BELA AND TOR \nThey're bewildered.  Bela WHISPERS. \nBELA Who the fuck is she?? \nTOR I never heard of her. \nEd walks over.  He hugs Bela. \nED And Bela, I want you to be the best man! \nBela smiles -- trying to hide his total confusion. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLATER \nThe wedding is in progress.  The crowd is seated.  A MINISTER performs the ceremony with Ed and Norma. \nMINISTER ...Norma, do you promise to love, honor, and cherish... \nIN THE CROWD \nEverybody is QUIETLY GOSSIPING. \nBUNNY I didn't even know he had a girlfriend. \nPAUL MARCO (he taps him on the shoulder) I hear she's an actress who gave him money. \nCONRAD Nah, I heard she's his childhood sweetheart from Poughkeepsie. \nCRISWELL I predict it's Dolores in a mask. \nAT THE ALTAR \nThe Minister is speaking to Ed. \nMINISTER ...in sickness and in health, till death do you part? \nBELA (near tears) Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent... \nED Don't you have any savings? \nBELA I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die. (distraught) And you should come with me. \nFrail Bela points the gun at Ed.  Ed is terrified. \nED Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea. \nBELA It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work. \nED Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun... (he cautiously steps forward) If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking? \nBELA Formaldehyde. \nEd stares in anguish. \nED Straight up or on the rocks? \nBela drops the gun.  He starts weeping. \nEd walks over and hugs the shaking old man. \nED Don't worry. \nBELA I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry. \nED Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOSPITAL - STILL LATER THAT NIGHT \nEd's car pulls up at the South Metropolitan State Hospital. It's a grim, unwelcoming edifice. \nEd helps weak Bela from the car.  They look at each other, then Ed gingerly leads Bela in. \nINT. HOSPITAL - SAME TIME \nThe lobby is clammy and dim.  Ed and Bela reach the desk.  A NURSE looks up, startled. \nNURSE My goodness, you gave me the willies. You look like that Dracula guy. \nBELA (very somber) My name is Bela Lugosi.  I wish to commit myself. \nNURSE For what reason? \nBELA I have been a drug addict for twenty years.  I need help... \nThe nurse nods.  She takes Bela's arm and leads him away.  Bela glances at Ed, then steps through a wide door.  As it swings shut, we see a DOCTOR walk over and shake Bela's hand. \nEd stares at the door, dazed by all that's happened.  He sits down in a chair, exhausted. \nEd's eyes slowly close, and he falls asleep... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL - MORNING \nEd is still asleep, but now sunlight beats in. \nEd stirs and wakes up.  He groggily looks around, and sitting across from him is a woman, knitting.  This is KATHY O'HARA, 26, solid, reflective, with a dry sense of humor.  Ed peers at her. \nED Hello. \nKATHY Hello. (beat) You're sleeping in a tuxedo. \nED I got married last night. \nKATHY Oh.  Congratulations. \nED The marriage already ended. \nKATHY Oh.  My condolences. \nEd watches her knit. \nED What are you making? \nKATHY Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital. \nED How long's he been here? \nKATHY This is my thirteenth pair. \nEd nods.  He spots the Doctor walk by. \nED Excuse me. (he runs to the Doctor) Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he? \nDOCTOR Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone. \nED Will he be okay? \nDOCTOR We'll do our best. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nWe are outside Bela's room.  He can be glimpsed inside, strapped to the bed and SCREAMING in pain.  He is going through painful withdrawal and shakes horribly. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - ANOTHER DAY \nEd strides into the hospital, wearing different clothes, and carrying a box of chocolates.  He waves at the nurse. \nED Hi, Lillian. \nNURSE (she smiles) Hi, Ed.  Boy, he's got a lot of visitors today. \nED He does? \nEd is puzzled.  He hurries back. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY \nA crowd of NEWSPAPER REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS overflow Bela's room.  Ed is astonished. \nED What's going on here?!  Excuse me! \nED No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later. \nBELA Oh.  So what is the scene about? \nED (improvising) Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event. \nBela nods.  He mulls this over. \nBELA Okay.  But what if I'm not in too big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower? \nED (he smiles) That's great.  Let's do a take. \nWIDE \nBela goes in the front door.  Ed gets behind the camera, then turns it ON. \nED Okay, roll camera!  Rolling.  Scene One, Take One! (pause) And... ACTION! \nThere's a moment.  And then Bela slowly steps outside, calm, dignified, walking with a cane.  He looks about -- and then something catches his eye.  He leans down and picks a flower. \nBela smells the flower, then abruptly drops it.  He starts crying.  A pause, and then he composes himself.  The old man slowly shuffles out of frame. \nEd peers emotionally from behind the camera. \nED And, cut... \nBELA Eddie, how was I? \nED (quiet) Perfect. \nBela is pleased. \nBELA Good. (beat) Now what about my close up? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD DUPLEX - DUSK \nEd's Nash convertible pulls up outside a neat little duplex in a nice neighborhood.  Ed is dressed up for a date.  He checks his hair nervously in the mirror, revealing an anxious boyishness we've never seen before. \nEd carries a bouquet of flowers to the front door.  He rings the bell.  Kathy opens the door.  She looks very pretty in a full skirt with a crinolin. \nKATHY Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional. \nED (a little embarrassed) I just picked them up on the way over... \nKATHY They're very nice. (she smiles sweetly) Let me get my coat. \nEXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT \nEd and Kathy are at a tattered traveling carnival.  Rattling steel rides and flashing lights spin about them.  They stroll through the crowds eating cotton candy.  Kathy wears one of Ed's flowers on her dress. \nKATHY So have you always lived in L.A.? \nED No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office... \nKATHY Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners. \nINT. SPOOK HOUSE - NIGHT \nEd and Kathy ride through the old mechanical spook house. \nKATHY Did you find it boring? \nED Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas... \nA wooden WITCH jumps out at them.  They ignore it. \nKATHY Oh.  I loved those shows!  \"Inner Sanctum\"... \"The Shadow\" -- \nED (getting excited) Yeah!  Don't forget \"Mercury Theatre\"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there. \nA creaky GHOST flies overhead. \nKATHY You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's. \nED What do you mean? \nKATHY \"Dracula.\" \nEd freaks out. \nED That's INCREDIBLE!  That's the first picture I ever saw!! \nWIDE \nMechanical BATS drop down and flap around them. \nKATHY That is incredible! (beat) You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie. \nED I had to sleep with the lights on for a month. (he smiles) But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that. \nKATHY A few years ago, I actually saw him do \"Dracula\" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person. \nCLOSEUP - ED \nHe starts at Kathy in wonder.  He is overcome. \nTheir car SMASHES through the tin exit doors. \nEXT. SPOOK HOUSE - SAME TIME \nEd and Kathy's little car comes to a stop.  He gets very serious. \nED Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know. (beat) I like to wear women's clothes. \nKATHY Huh? \nED I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road. \nKathy is amazed.  She contemplates all this. \nKATHY Does this mean you don't like sex with girls? \nED No! I love sex with girls. \nKATHY Oh.  Okay. \nED (surprised) Okay? \nKathy slyly grins. \nA WOMAN'S VOICE cackles. \nWOMAN'S VOICE It's the blind leading the blind! \nTor staggers to his feet.  All disoriented, he starts walking the wrong direction and falls over a chair.  People HECKLE. \nCriswell quickly helps his up. \nTOR Dis is a nightmare. \nCRISWELL It's show biz. \nCriswell pushes Tor in the right direction.  Some roughnecks knock down Criswell and snatch his wallet. \nA MEAN BOY jumps on his chair, ripping the stuffing out of the seat.  He throws the fibers in the air, and they float over Bela and Vampira. \nBELA What is that? \nVAMPIRA I think they're getting ready to burn this place down. \nA HIGH SCHOOL PUNK runs up and grabs Vampira's breasts. \nHIGH SCHOOL PUNK Hey Vampira, how 'bout a little love? \nVAMPIRA Fuck off! \nShe impulsively swings her arm and SLAMS the kid. \nON STAGE \nThe Manager pleads to the mob. \nTHEATER MANAGER Children, please!  Be calm! \nSomebody throws a bottle and HITS him in the head.  He goes down. \nWIDE \nThe lights suddenly go off.  Some girls SCREAM. \nEd's panicked.  He grabs Kathy and runs down to his friends. \nED C'mon!  We're getting the hell out of here! \nEd rounds up Bela, Tor, Criswell, and Vampira. \nThe crowd BOOS louder.  Blind Tor is totally confused. \nTOR What is happening? \nED We're escaping! \nThe group runs up the aisle and leaves.  As the doors close, \"Bride Of The Monster\" starts unspooling on the screen. \nEXT. THEATER - SAME TIME \nThe gang frantically runs out, scared for their lives. \nThey look over.  Some JUVENILE DELINQUENTS are stripping the hearse. \nVAMPIRA We're gonna die. \nThe theater doors CRASH open.  The angry mob pours out. \nEd spins wildly around... and sees a cab approaching. \nED Stop! \nKATHY STOP! \nKathy runs frenziedly into the street and throws herself at the cab.  It screeches to a halt. \nEverybody sprints over and jumps in.  The cab ROARS away. \nINT. CAB - SAME TIME \nAll of them are breathing heavily.  They watch in the rear window as they drive away from the rampage. \nA nervous silence.  Until Bela speaks. \nBELA Now that was a premiere. \nAll of them LAUGH. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY \nBela and Ed stroll down the street, in high spirits.  Bela smokes a big fat cigar. \nBELA Last night was quite a romp. \nED Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits? \nBELA I envied him. (he chuckles) Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that. \nED Yeah, she's really somethin'. \nBELA I know none of my wives would've. \nEd laughs.  Bela puffs his cigar. \nBELA Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time. \nED I just wish you coulda seen the movie. \nBELA No problem.  I know it by heart... \nBela stops walking.  And in a BOOMING, THEATRICAL VOICE, he suddenly launches into his impassioned, climactic speech from \"Bride Of The Monster.\" \nBELA \"Home.  I have no home.  Hunted... despised... living like an animal -- the jungle is my home!  But I will show the world that I can be its master.  I shall perfect my own race of people... a race of atomic supermen that will conquer the world!\" \nEd is touched. \nA few people around them APPLAUD. \nBela's face lights up, proud.  An awed MIDWESTERN TOURIST hands him a pen and paper. \nTOURIST Mr. Lugosi, could I have your autograph? \nBELA Certainly. \nED (he sloppily lies) I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one. \nINT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME \nEd motions Reynolds in.  Reynolds peers unsurely at the tornado inside.  Then he notices a framed one-sheet for \"BRIDE OF THE MONSTER.\"  Reynolds admires it. \nREYNOLDS Hmm, so you're in the picture business? \nED (rummaging for a check) You could say that -- \nREYNOLDS I'm interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money. \nED (distracted) Raising money is tough. \nREYNOLDS Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve... \nANGLE - ED \nHis eyes suddenly pop. \nThe color comes back to his fact.  A plan is quickly boiling over inside Ed's head.  He starts feverishly pacing around. \nED Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from that, and make the twelve Apostles' movies. \nREYNOLDS Would that work? \nED Absolutely!  You see this script..? \nEd randomly grabs a script off the messy floor, then glances down, to see which one he picked up.  It says \"Graverobbers From Outer Space.\" \nED \"Graverobbers From Outer Space\"! It's money in the bank. \nREYNOLDS Graverobbers from what?? \nED From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  Very big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films! (beat) And pay my back rent from the profits. \nReynolds scratches his head. \nREYNOLDS I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb. \nED It's a guaranteed blockbuster! \nREYNOLDS Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars? \nED (in a frenzy) Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!! \nREYNOLDS (mystified) Lugosi??!  Didn't be pass on? \nEd grins maniacally.  He grabs a SMALL REEL of 35mm film. \nED Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot! \nREYNOLDS Just, it doesn't look like very much. \nED It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as \"Bela Lugosi's Final Film\" \nA beat.  Reynolds stares, intrigued... \nCUT TO: \nINT. ED'S APARTMENT - LATER \nThe place is cleaned-up.  Ed shouts excitedly into the phone. \nED Bunny!  We're making another film! Yeah -- I got the Baptist Church of Beverly Hills to put up the cash! \nPaul sticks his head in. \nPAUL MARCO Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside. \nED Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run. \nEd hangs up. \nPaul leads in THREE.  They look nothing like Bela.  One is a HOMELESS BUM, one is a SHORT FAT MAN, and one is CHINESE. \nEd inspects them. \nED Too tall... too short... (he glances at the Chinese guy) And this guy doesn't work at all. \nPAUL MARCO Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played \"Fu Manchu.\" \nED That was Karloff. (beat) Paul, you gotta try harder.  I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality. \nPaul turns to go. \nED And by the way, keep Sunday free. The producers want all of us to get baptized. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - DAY \nKathy reads a newspaper while knitting an angora sweater.  Ed is typing deliriously fast -- in one of his artistic fevers. \nED You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better! \nKATHY Do you want your buttons on the left or the right? \nED The left.  It's more natural. (he squints at his script) Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of? \nKATHY Uh, atomic energy? \nED No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's more advanced? \nKATHY Dynamite -- \nED No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy?? \nKATHY The sun. \nED (ecstatic) Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific. (he resumes TYPING) This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  No compromises. \nKathy suddenly jumps up, shocked. \nKATHY Oh my God.  Look at this! \nShe runs over and shows Ed the newspaper. \nINSERT - THE NEWSPAPER \nA small headline says \"VAMPIRA REVEALED TO BE RED.\"  Underneath is the story: \"Channel 7 has fired popular horror hostess Vampira, after learning of her suspected communist leanings...\" \nReynolds DUNKS Bunny. \nTHE REVEREND BAPTIZES TOR \nREVEREND LEMON ...Do you repent for all your sins? \nTOR I do. \nTor winks slyly at Criswell. \nReynolds DUNKS Tor.  But Tor slips from Reynolds' grasp and sinks to the bottom of the pool. \nREYNOLDS Oh my God, I dropped him -- \nTor lies on the bottom, staring lifeinsly. \nCRISWELL (mischievous) I don't think he's coming up! \nREVEREND LEMON Lord no!  The man's drowning! \nREYNOLDS (scared) What do we do?! \nREVEREND LEMON Help!  HELP!!! \nThe whole Congregation starts JUMPING IN.  Men and women in their Sunday finest leap into the pool and start tugging on Tor.  But nobody can budge the big whale. \nREVEREND LEMON (near tears) Dear Jesus, please forgive us! \nON TOR \nHe suddenly rises, Poseidon-like, from the pool. \nTor spits out water, then lets out a hearty BELLY LAVGH. \nTOR Tor make good joke! \nThe Baptists aren't amused. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CITY BUS - MORNING \nA bus drives along.  Every PASSENGER stares at something up front -- Vampira, in her slinky black outfit.  She reads a \"Grave Robbers From Outer Space\" script. \nEXT. SCUMMY NEIGHBORHOOD - SAME TIME \nThe bus stops in a scary, run-down neighborhood.  Vampira off and warily looks around. \nVAMPIRA This can't be the right address... \nShe nervously walks down a dingy alley.  Vampira gets to an unmarked grimy door, gulps, then slowly opens it... \nINT. WAREHOUSE SOUNDSTAGE - DAY \nAnd inside is the \"Grave Robbers From Outer Space\" famous CEMETERY SET!  The film is in production!  Packed into a stinking little studio are a few scrawny twigs, branches, and flimsy cardboard tombstones set against a black drop. \nTot struts about gregariously, in his \"Inspector Clay\" suit. He chats up the CREW. \nTOR I am so happy!  Finally I am star wit dialogue!  I memorized every wordt. Eddie will be so proud! \nThe Baptists chase Ed around.  They wave the script. \nREYNOLDS Before we start shooting, Mr. Wood, we have a few questions -- \nREVEREND LEMON The script refers on numerous occasions to graverobbing.  Now we find the concept of digging up consecrated ground highly offensive. It's blasphemy. \nED (very annoyed) What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake! \nREVEREND LEMON (shocked) Mr. Wood! \nREYNOLDS Yes, about that title, it strikes us as very inflammatory.  Why don't we change it to \"Plan Nine From Outer Space\"? \nEd shakes his head. \nED That's ridiculous! \nWIPE TO: \nCEMETERY SET \nThey're filming the COPS arriving at the pitch-black cemetery. There's a prop police car, and an assistant blows fog in. \nED And, ACTION! \nTor steps onto the set \nTOR (as Inspector Clay) \"Medicul eksaminer been aroundt yet?\" \nCOP \"Just left.  The morgue wagon oughta be along most any time.\" \nTOR \"You get statement frumk vitnesses?\" \nCOP \"Yeah, but they're pretty scared.\" \nTOR \"Findink mess like dis oughta make anyone frightened.  Have one of da boyz take dem back to town.  You take jarge.\" \nON THE CREW \nEverybody grices, trying to understand Tor.  The SCRIPT GIRL shakes her head. \nThe Baptists angrily pull Ed aside. \nREYNOLDS What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible! \nED Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give somebody the dialogue. \nREVEREND LEMON That's not an answer. \nWIPE TO: \nANOTHER SCENE BEING SHOT - LATER \nAs Inspector Clay, Tor wanders around the \"cemtery,\" waving his flashlight and nervously fingering his gun. \nEd grins at the Baptists. \nED See, no talking.  Isn't he good? (he grabs his MEGAPHONE) CUE DR. TOM! \nDR. TOM (o.s.) Now? \nED YES, NOW!  LURK HIM.  AND BE SURE TO KEEP YOUR FACE COVERED! \nEd nervously stands.  He starts to step forward -- when he catches his own reflection in a mirror.  He's still in drag. \nED Oh shit. \nEd rolls his eyes.  He runs his hand through his hair, then slowly approaches Orson Welles.  Ed is terrified. \nED Excuse me, Sir...? \nORSON WELLES (he casually looks up) Yes? \nED Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you. \nORSON WELLES (he extends his hand) My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles. \nED Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood! (he smiles anxiously) So, what are you working on now? \nORSON WELLES Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on \"Don Quixote.\" So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack -- (he shrugs) I think I left it in Malta. \nEd is astonished. \nED I can't believe it.  These sound like my problems! \nORSON WELLES It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think they're a director... \nED Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies -- \nORSON WELLES Ugh, I hate when that happens. \nED (on a roll) And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even matter if they're right for the part! \nORSON WELLES Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a Mexican! \nEd shakes his head.  He's discouraged. \nED Mr. Welles, is it all worth it? \nORSON WELLES It is when it works. (solemn) You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  \"Kane.\"  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame. (he smiles warmly) Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams? \nCLOSEUP - ED \nHe has seen God. \nED Wow. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY \nEd bursts onto the stage, a changed man.  Re-energized, he confidently grabs the Baptists. \nED Mr. Reynolds! \nREYNOLDS Yes? \nED We are gonna finish this film just the way I want it!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision! \nREVEREND LEMON (flustered) B-but it's our money -- \nED And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way! \nReynolds and Rev. Lemon are speechiess. \nCLOSEUP - ED \nHe beams, turns and SHOUTS TRIUMPHANTLY into the soundstage. \nED ALRIGHT!  ACTORS IN POSITION!  LET'S FINISH THIS PICTURE!! \nWIPE TO: \n\"PLAN 9\" MONTAGE: \nSCENE IN THE CEMETERY SET \nTor plays a zombie rising from the dead.  He wears the scary white contact lenses.  Tor's so big, he has trouble lifting himself from the grave. \nEDITING ROOM \nEd and his stock footage buddy watch a moviola. \nED Okay, I want that tank!  And I want that bomb! \nSOUNDSTAGE \nHarry paints Bunny's face GREEN, like a Martian.  Ed yells. \nED NO!  The aliens should look like people. \nMAKE-UP MAN HARRY I'm tellin' ya, aliens are always green. \nED Not in my movie, they're not! \nSCENE IN THE SPACESHIP SET \nBunny's make-up is now normal.  He wears an alien suit.  A HAMMY ALIEN enters and salutes with a bizarre crossing gesture. \nBUNNY \"What plan will we follow?\" \nHAMMY ALIEN \"Plan Nine.\" \nBUNNY \"Plan Nine...\" (he consults his papers) \"Ah yes.  Plan Nine deals with the resurrection of the dead.\" \nSCENE IN THE CEMETERY \nTor staggers up to Paul Marco and CLOBBERS him. \nOFF-STAGE \nEd smiles at the Baptists. \nED Maybe you guys were right.  \"Plan Nine\" is a good title. \nMINIATURE CITY SET \nEd shoots the famous flying saucers.  Paul holds a paper plate and Conrad lights it on fire. \nThe \"saucer\" soars on fishing line over a little miniature town. \nSCENE IN THE BEDROOM SET \nDr. Tom glides in, his cape over his face.  A woman SCREAMS. \n", "test1_input": "ED (on phone) Hello, Mr. Weiss?  I heard about your new project and was curious if you signed a director.  Oh -- you haven't?  Well, if we could get together, I could explain why I'm more qualified to direct this than anyone else in town. (beat) Uh, I'd rather not go into it over the phone...  Alright.  Great!  l'll see you then! \nEd hangs up and YELPS excitedly.  He kisses Dolores.  She pulls away. \nDOLORES Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are you the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story? \nED (nervous, he lies) Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOW-RENT HALLWAY - DAY \nEd walks jauntily along, wearing a snappy suit.  He reaches a door that says \"SCREEN CLASSICS \u00f3 George Weiss, President.\" Ed fixes his hair, checks his clothes, then enters. \nINT. SCREEN CLASSICS \u00f3 SAME TIME \nIt's a crowded root, piled with paperwork and files.  Film cans are stacked everywhere, and framed one\u00f3sheets for \"TEST TUBE BABIES,\" \"BLONDE PICKUP\" and \"GIRL GANG\" litter the cracked walls.  Sitting behind the messy desk is GEORGIE WEISS, 60, a rug merchant turned exploitation film producer.  He juggles a large sandwich and angrily barks into the phone. \nGEORGIE (on phone) Look, when I said you could have the western territories, I didn't mean all eleven states!  I meant California, Oregon, and uh, what's that one above it... Washington.  Oh really?!  Well screw you! \nGeorgie slams down the phone.  He smiles warmly at Ed. \nGEORGIE Can I help you? \nED Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture. \nGEORGIE Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn \"Variety\" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky. \nED (disappointed) So you're not gonna make the movie? \nGEORGIE No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already pre\u00f3sold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it. \nGeorgie bites into his sandwich.  Ed is dazed. \nED Is there a script? \nGEORGIE Fuck no!  But there's a poster. \nGeorgie pulls out artwork of a hermaphrodite: Man on the left side, woman on the right.  The lettering screams, \"I CHANGED MY SEX!\" \nGEORGIE It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa. \nED (mustering up his courage) Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism. \nGEORGIE Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of \"special qualifications.\" \nEd takes a measured piuse.  This is his big revelation. \nED Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job. (he gulps) I like to dress in women's clothing. \nGEORGIE Are you a fruit? \nED No, no, not at all!  I love women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them. \nGEORGIE So you're not a fruit? \nED Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2. (beat) 'Course, I was wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform. \nGEORGIE You gotta be kiddin' me. \nED Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was terrified of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret. \nGeorgie sits back.  It's a hell of a story. \nGEORGIE And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie? \nED Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out. \nGeorgie shrugs. \nGEORGIE Ed, you seem like a nice kid, but look around you... (he gestures at the posters) I don't hire directors with burning desires to tell their stories. I make movies like \"Chained Girls.\" I need someone with experience who can shoot a film in four days that'll make me a profit. (beat) I'm sorry.  That's all that matters. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BAR \u00f3 DAY \nEd sits morosely in a scuzzy bar, three empty shot glasses in front of him.  A BARTENDER ambles over. \nBARTENDER Are you gonna get something else? \nEd glumly empties his pocket.  All he has is change.  Ed sighs, and staggers out. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY \nEd shuffles down the street, his head hanging low.  A restaurant door opens, and an EISENHOWER ERA NUCLEAR FAMILY exits.  Whitebread Dad, Mom, Son, and Daughter stride out in their starched clean clothes. \nThey march obliviously past Ed.  He watches them go, then continues.  Ed reaches a building, \"HOLLYWOOD MORTUARY,\" and glances in the window.  A pause, then he does a doubletake. \nTHROUGH THE WINDOW \nThe showroom is filled with sample coffins.  Lying inside one is BELA LUGOSI. \nANGLE - ED \nHe is flabbergasted. \nINT. HOLLYWOOD MORTUARY - SAME TIME \nLugosi slowly sits up inside the coffin.  Bela is an aged 70- year-old man, once a great star, now a faded memory trying to hang on to his nobility.  Quite frail and tired, he is still a master of the grand gesture. \nAn UNCTUOUS SALESMAN steps up.  Bela speaks, in a thick Hungarian ACCENT which gives him an Old World elegance. \nBELA Too constrictive.  This is the most uncomfortable coffin I have ever been in. \nSALESMAN Gee, Mr. Lugosi, I've never had any complaints before. \nBELA The selection is quite shoddy.  You are wasting my time. \nMildly annoyed, Bela climbs out. He straightens his cloak and walks to the exit -- where be bumps into nervous Ed. \nED Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi?? \nBELA (irritated) I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins. \nED No.  I don't work here. \nBELA Huh? \nBela peers at Ed, then glances confusedly over his shoulder at the salesman.  Oh.  Bela looks back at anxious Ed. \nBELA Who are you?  What do you want? \n", "test1_true": "BELA Ha! \nBela strides out. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - SAME TIME \nBela hurries along.  Ed chases after him. \nED Why were you buying a coffin? \nBELA Because I'm planning on dying soon. \nED (concerned) Really? \nBELA Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- and\u00f3truck tour of \"Dracula.\" Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable. \nBela pulls out a large smelly cigar and lights it. \nED You know, I saw you perform \"Dracula.\"  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938. \nBELA Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk! \nED I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie. \nBELA Thank you. \nED I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside. \nBELA I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge. \nA CITY BUS approaches. \nBELA Oh, there's my bus. (he checks his pockets) Shit, where's my transfer?! \nED Don't you bave a car? \nBELA I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen. \nThe bus pulls up, and the doors open.  Ed is worried he's about to lose his new friend.  He gets an idea... \nCUT TO: \nINT. 1948 NASH RAMBLER - DAY \nEd drives anxiously.  Bela sits next to him, filling the car with smoke from his big cigar. \nED Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out? \nBELA I have no next picture. \nED Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up. \nBELA Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela. \nBela puffs on his oversized cigar. \nED But you're a big star! \nBELA No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman. (he points) Make a right. \nEXT. BELA'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nEd drives past pumping oil wells and into a seedy neighborhood. They reach a tiny, well-manicured house.  Ed and Bela get out. \nBELA (bitter) They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense! \nED The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons... \nBELA They were mythic.  They had a poetry to them. (he lowers his voice) And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters. \nED The women? \nBELA The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror. \nED I never thought of that. \nBELA Take my word for it.  You want to \"score\" with a young lady, you take her to see \"Dracula.\" \nBela's eyes twinkle.  He reaches his front door and unlocks it. INSIDE... it's awful.  Squalid, dark, with skulls and strange voodoo objects scattered about.  Up front hangs a large photograph of shockingly young Bela, handsome and regal. \nEd is stunned by this dismal place, but doesn't say anything. Within, DOGS start BARKING crazily. \nBELA Ugh, what a mess. (beat) My wife of twenty years left me last month.  I'm not much of a housekeeper. \nThe dogs BARK louder. \nBELA Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you! \nED Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again? \nBELA (he shakes his hand) Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me. \nBela smiles and steps inside.  The door closes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOLORES'S APARTMRNT - DAY \nDolores is in her 1950's kitchenette, making a green jello mold.  Ed bursts in, euphoric. \nED Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news! \nDOLORES (excited) You got the job?!! \nED Huh?! (confused) Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something better happened! \nDOLORES Better than not getting a job? \nED Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody really big! \nDOLORES Who?  Robert Taylor?! \nED (annoyed) No!  A horror movie star! \nDOLORES Boris Karloff!? \nED Close!  The other one! \nDOLORES You met Basil Rathbone! \n", "test1_id": 2751, "test2_input": "ED Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI! \nDOLORES I thought he was dead. \nEd's eyes pop. \nED No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice. \nDOLORES Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture. \nED It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore. \nDOLORES So did you get his autograph? \nEd calms down.  He smiles beatifically. \nED No.  It wasn't like that at all.  It was just the two of us, and we were talkin'... and he treated me like -- a friend... \nCUT TO: \nINT. STUDIO WAREHOUSE - DAY \nEd is back in the plant department, arguing with his boss. \nRUDE BOSS He's a bum. \nED No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  \"Dracula\"!  \"The Raven\"! \"The Black Cat\"! \nRUDE BOSS Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work. \nED That's not true -- \nRUDE BOSS He's so great, you hire him. \nED (defensive) Well, uh, if I could I would... \nThe guy takes a mocking face and struts out.  Ed glares. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BELA'S ROUSE - NIGHT \nIt's Halloween night.  CHILDREN in trick-or-treating costumes parade up and down the streets.  Through Bela's window, we see him and Ed watching TELEVISION -- a small fuzzy screen in a huge console. \nINT. BELA'S HOUSE - SAME TIME \nON THE TV, one of Bela's old '30s horror films plays.  Bela's evil character is hypnotizing somebody: His eyes stare the famous stare, then his hand does the famous hypnotic gesture. \nON ED AND BELA \nThey are entranced.  The men drink beers in silence.  Bela's TWO DOGS lie at his feet. \nON THE TV \nThe old movie suddenly stops, and VAMPIRA appears on the TV screen. Vampira, 25, is the sexy \"Creature Feature\" hostess, a pale ghoul slipped into a tight black dress. \nShe leers in front of a corny fog-shrouded set.  There is a pumpkin, a broomstick, and a sign reading \"Happy Halloween.\" \nVAMPIRA (on TV) Ooo!  Those eyes!  He gives me the willies!  The only thing scarier than him is this guy I dated last week: Charlie from Pittsburgh.  Boy, talk about the living dead... \nON THE MEN \nEd is disgruntled. \nED Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect. \nBELA (glued to the TV) I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs. \nEd LAUGHS.  Bela waves his arm and starts doing his hypnotic hand gesture at the TV. \nBELA Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love. \nED (fascinated by Bela's hand) Hey Bela, how do you do that? \nBELA You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian. (back at the TV) Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes. \nEd joins Bela in this activity.  The two of them wave their arms spookily at the TV. \nBela becomes fatigued. \nBELA I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine. \nED Do you want me to get it for you? \nBELA No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright. \nBela smiles.  He gets up, shuffles across the room, and steps behind a curtain.  Ed is puzzled.  Bela's thin arm appears and draws the curtain tight.  We hear mysterious CLANGING, drawers opening and closing, and then silence. \nEd sits, waiting. \nBehind the curtain, something DROPS.  We hear a muffled \"Shit!\" \nEd is getting worried.  But then the curtain whips open, and Bela bounds out, grinning.  He's a bundle of energy. \nBELA I feel better now. \nAT THE DOOR \nThe doorbell RINGS.  Kids SHOUT \"Trick or treat!\"  Bela jumps up gleefully. \nBELA Children!  I love children. \nBela puts on his famous cape, then gets a pair of fangs and sticks them in his mouth. \nOUTSIDE \nLittle kids in Lone Ranger and Howdy Doody costumes giggle expectantly. \nSuddenly the door flies open, and standing there is Count Dracula!  The real Count Dracula.  YEOWWWW!!!  The kids SCREAM and run. \nBela chuckles.  Every kid is gone... except one TOUGH BOY. \nBELA Aren't you scared, little boy?  I'm going to drink your blood! \nTOUGH BOY Ehh, you're not a real vampire. You can't turn into a bat, and those teeth don't frighten me. \nSuddenly Ed lurches out, menacingly. \nED Well how about these teeth?!! \nEd RIPS HIS TEETH out of his head and thrusts them at the kid.  The boy SCREAMS in terror and races away. \n", "test2_true": "BELA Hey, how'd you do that? \nEd smiles impishly, then sticks the teeth back in his mouth. \nED Dentures.  I lost my pearlies in the war. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT \nEd and Bela run toward us, Bela's cape flapping in the wind. Ed takes a swig from Bela's flask.  They're a bit tipsy. \nED Are you sure this is okay? \nBELA Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween. \nEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT \nThe moonlight shines down on a rickety old cemetery.  The wind blows hauntingly, and tombstones gleam in the blackness. \nEd and Bela reach the locked gates.  They glance at each other, then start to climb over.  Ed helps Bela.  They jump down, and Ed peers nervously. \nED Now what? \nBela looks like a child on Christmas morning.  He takes another swig, then starts running giddily. \nHe disappears into the cemetery. \nBELA I am DRACULA! \nBela darts happily through the graves. \nHis cape flies behind him. \nBELA I am the BAT!! \nEd's eyes light up.  He starts chasing after Bela. \nBela's heart is racing.  He zig-zags past ancient crypts. Gargoyles peer down.  The wind howls through the skeletal trees, silhouetted against the cloudy sky. \nEd runs through the shadows, trying to catch up. \nBela flaps his cape up and down.  We almost think he's going to fly. \nEd races up, then quietly stops.  He eagerly watches Bela, practically expecting him to turn into a bat.  It's a magical, crazed moment. \nBELA I am DRACUlA!  I will LIVE FOREVER!!! \nBela laughs, then lies down on the grass. \nWIDE \nEd slowly walks over and lies next to Bela.  They're happy, eyes alert, on top of the world. \nEd peers in wonder at his new friend. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCREEN CLASSICS OFFICE - DAY \nEd sits across from Georgie.  Ed's very excited. \nGEORGIE So what's the big news you couldn't tell me over the phone... again? \nEd gulps excitedly.  He has a spiel all planned out. \nED Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful?? \nGEORGIE (he thinks) Tits. \nED No.  Better than tits -- a star! \nGeorgie shakes his head. \nGEORGIE Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap. \nED Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something! \nGEORGIE Yeah.  Crap with a star. \nED (impassioned) No!  It would be something better! Something impressive.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had! \nGEORGIE Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about. \nEd grins. \nED What if I told you you could have a star for $1000?? \nGEORGIE (skeptical) Who? \nEd opens his valise and whips out an 8x10 GLOSSY OF BELA. \nGEORGIE Lugosi? \nED Yeah!  Lugosi! \nGEORGIE Isn't he dead? \nED (annoyed) No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture. \nGEORGIE OUR picture? \nED (sheepishly) Uh, yeah.  Our picture. \nGeorgie mulls this over.  He's interested. \nGEORGIE Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick? \nED Because he's my friend. \nGeorgie stares carefully at Ed, then finally smiles. \nGEORGIE Alright, fine!  You can direct it. I want a script in three days, and we start shooting a week from Monday. \nANGLE - ED \nHe leaps up euphorically.  He eagerly pumps Georgie's hand. \nED Thank you!  Bless you, Mr. Weiss! I promise I won't let you down! \n", "test2_id": 2752, "test3_input": "SURLY STAGE MANAGER Hey, Wood. Your check bounced. \nED Okay, I'll get you the money later. \nSURLY STAGE MANAGER No.  I need it NOW. \nEd nods grimly.  He grabs Loretta and takes her aside. \nED Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money. \nLORETTA Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you? \nED (he smiles) Yeah.  Exactly! \nThere's a pause.  They stare at each other. \nED I kinda need it now. \nLORETTA (baffled) What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred. \nED Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand. \nLORETTA What other sixty-thousand? \nED The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me. \nLORETTA You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars. \nCLOSEUP - ED \nHe looks like he s going to throw up. \nED Oh my God. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY \nThe large stage door SLAMS shut. \nEd's disoriented cast and crew stand in the street.  Bela, Tor, and Loretta are still in costume. \nEd looks totally dazed.  He blinks in the bright sunlight. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT \nWe're back at the Brown Derby, for another backers party.  The same banner is hanging: \"BRIDE OF THE ATOM -- NEXT YEAR'S SMASH HIT!\" \nThe whole crowd is there, dressed up.  Bela sits in the corner, knocking back a drink. \nBELA Here we go again. \nPaul whispers to Bunny. \nPAUL MARCO So is Dolores coming? \nBUNNY (very catty) I can't imagine why.  I wouldn't put up with a boyfriend who sold me out for three-hundred dollars...! \nON ED \nEd stands with a circle of POTENTIAL BACKERS.  He has an edge of desperation we've never seen before. \nED ...lemme tell you, you can't lose. It's scary!  And if you don't like that, it's romantic!  Bela Lugosi portrays Dr. Vornoff, and lovely ingenue Loretta King is reporter Janet Lawton. \nPOTENTIAL BACKER Hmm.  Lugosi looks pretty old. (he squints across the room) Which role is Vampira playing? \nED Vampira...? (bewildered) Why do you ask?? \nPOTENTIAL BACKER Well I see her standing over there. \nThe guy points.  Ed turns and looks and Vampira is standing in the next room.  She's at a different party. \nED Well... she's playing -- (beat) Could you excuse me one moment?? \nEd dashes from the room. \nNEXT ROOM OVER \nVampira is drinking with a bunch of artsy-fartsy types.  She's in street clothes, but clearly recognizable.  Ed runs up. \nED Excuse me, Miss Vampira? \nVAMPIRA Yes? \nED (sweaty) You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood.  I'm a film producer.  I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson.  And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet! \nVampira stares, totally uncomprehending. \nVAMPIRA I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph? \nED No.  I think my film is perfect for you. \nVAMPIRA You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven -- \nED (unyielding) No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be in it!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...? \nVampire glances at her friends.  They uncomfortably turn away. \nVAMPIRA Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat -- \nED (begging) Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard... \nVAMPIRA (pissed off) Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it! \nBACK AT THE PARTY \nThe backers glance into the next room.  Ed is in front of Vampira, begging on his hands and knees. \nBACKER (to another backer) I'm getting a bad feeling about this. Let's get out of here. \nThe backers pick up their coats.  Through the doorway, Ed sees this.  He jumps up and frantically runs back in. \nED Where are you guys going?!  You can't leave! \nBACKER (running out) Goodbye, Mr. Wood. \nED (insane) You can't go!  You haven't seen the storyboards! \nThe backers run out of the room. They're gone. Ed shouts after them. \n", "test3_true": "No response. \nED Please, come back! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ED AND DOLORES' HOUSE - DAY \nEd and Dolores are being evicted.  Their belongings are scattered in front.  They bitterly carry furniture out of the house.  Ed stumbles and slurs his speech.  He is drunk. \nED Goddamn landlord. \nDOLORES I told you this was gonna happen. \nED Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money. \nDOLORES That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer? \nED (he starts yelling) Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich. \nDOLORES That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend. \nED I didn't dump you!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part! \nEd drops the furniture.  He flops onto the sidewalk. \nDOLORES You're a fuckin' mess. \nED So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay. \nDOLORES I'm going to my mother's. \nED Does she have room for me? \nDolores shakes her head. \nDOLORES I think you should stay with one of your friends. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TOWERING TEMPLE - NIGHT \nEd and Bela stroll through a parking lot.  Ed is sobered up and remorseful.  Bela wears a beret and smokes a huge cigar. \nED Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore... \nBELA Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits. \nThey reach the strange entrance to an avant-garde, Eastern based quasi-religious temple.  Bela puts out his cigar, and they enter the oversized doors. \nINT. TEMPLE - SAME TIME \nSphinxes and Bodhisatvas peer down from the marble walls.  A service is in progress.  A wiry, enigmatic LECTURER speaks. \nLECTURER Thou eternal sun, who has covered the consciousness with thy golden disc, do thou remove the veil so that I may see the truth within? \nBela leads Ed to a seat, stepping past men in fezzes and odd elderly women in fur coats.  As the lecture continues, Ed WHISPERS in bafflement. \nED What is this place? \nBELA This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years. \nLECTURER ...for the truth which is within thee is within me.  And I am Truth. \nBELA Most people in this country, they know nothing, about Eastern mysticism. They are afraid of it. (beat) But I am open-minded.  It gives me hope. \nLECTURER We have the wisdom to govern and the divine right to inherit the earth in good condition.  We have the power to build worlds. \nEd leans in to Bela. \nED Was I wrong to cast Loretta? \nBELA Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward. \nED But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie. \nBELA Eddie, you screwed up. \nED (he nods) Yeah, I did. \nCUT TO: \nLATER \nThe lecture is over.  The speaker shakes hands with people. Bela leads Ed along. \nBELA In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered. (beat) Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture. \nED Really? \nBELA It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king. \nED So why didn't you do it? \nBELA I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag. (pause) I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave. \nED But maybe not. \nBELA Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one. \nThey reach the exit.  Ed stops in the huge doorway. \nED Your next film.  That will be the one. \nBela smiles sweetly. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MCCOY MEATPACKING PLANT - DAY \nWe're in a noisy meat-packing plant.  WORKERS in blood-stained aprons slam cleavers into hunks of beef. \nEd walks down an aisle with DONALD E. McCOY, a wealthy Texan meat man.  Old Man McCoy is a tough-talking, tobacco-chewing, straight shooter. \nED ...and then Dr. Vornoff falls in the pit, and his own octopus attacks and eats him!  The End. \nOLD MAN McCOY Whew!  That's quite a story.  So you made the movie, and now you want to make it again? \nED (gently correcting him) No.  We shot ten minutes of the movie, and now we're looking for completion funds. \n", "test3_id": 2753}

MEMORY: 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
SUPERTITLE:   Pesaro, Italy, 1926 
Young Guido, dressed in his school uniform, runs fast across the rough dunes with five boys from the village. 
The boys head for a graffiti-covered defensive wall with barbed wire along the top, a leftover from the war. 
They reach into pockets and extract small change, hand it to Young Guido, already the ring leader. 
They crawl through a small opening in the wall and approach an abandoned bunker... 
EXT. SARAGHINA'S BUNKER - DAY 
...Young Guido takes a step forward toward the bunker, as the other boys fearfully take a step back. 
YOUNG GUIDO (not loud enough) Saraghina. (louder) Saraghina. 
Now all the boys join in. 
BOYS Saraghina!   Saraghina! 
YOUNG GUIDO (loudest) Saraghina! Sa-ra-ghina! 
A shadow moves inside the bunker. Now even Young Guido takes a step back, but the boys are taking three steps back. 
And then she comes out. SARAGHINA is a gritty, earthy woman, with a powerful, voluptuous energy. She has darkened eyes and a beauty mark: she is clearly the model for the whore makeup on Carla. 
She looks at the boys. She may be a crazy whore, but she's not an animal, she's just playing one for the boys, and they don't quite understand that she's having her own fun with them. 
She takes a deliberate step. Young Guido stands his ground. She takes another step and holds out her hand. p. 44 
Young Guido opens his hand with the coins. 
She looks at the money.   Is it enough? 
But she grabs his wrist, and holds it, and then takes the coins. 
She stuffs the money in her ample bosom and heads back to her bunker. She returns dragging an old broken chair, places it in front of the boys and sits, ready for the "show." 
Saraghina scoops up the soft white sand in her hands and pours it over her body... 
A dark vamp begins. 
FANTASY: 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
Curtains of falling sand fill the soundstage. 
Through the sand, we see Saraghina seated on the same chair from the beach. She speaks, surrounded by other WHORES in provocative positions on beaten-up chairs. 
SARAGHINA So, you little Italian devils, you want to know about love? Saraghina will tell you...and if you want to make a woman happy, you rely on what you were born with. Because it is in your blood. 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
With a smile, she pulls her dress off her shoulders. 
INT. "SOUNDSTAGE" 
SARAGHINA (sings) BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN. TAKE A CHANCE, AND TRY TO STEAL A FIERY KISS. BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN. WHEN YOU HOLD ME, DON'T JUST HOLD ME BUT HOLD THIS!

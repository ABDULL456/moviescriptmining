It is obvious now that he finds Ivy attractive.  She says nothing, so he turns and slowly leaves.  The rain has stopped.  When he is gone, she turns the bag over and dumps the rocks on the ground. 
Edward (off-screen; a memory):  Do your very best not to scream. 
A door opens, and Edward leads Ivy into the old shed. 
Ivy:  There is an odd smell. 
Edward:  It is ahead of you. 
Ivy:  What is it? 
Edward:  I cannot explain in words.  It is just a few steps. 
She steps carefully forward with her hand out, and touches something, long and spiky.  She brings her fingers down to the bottom.  It is part of one of the creatures.  She gasps loudly and steps back.  Edward holds her. 
Ivy:  Those We Don't Speak Of! 
Edward:  Do not be frightened.  It is only... farce.  Do not be frightened. 
She slowly begins to calm.  There are three "creatures" hanging from the ceiling of the shed.  They have boar-like masks inside their robes, and clawed hands.  They are costumes. 
Edward and Ivy sit outside the shed, leaning against its stone wall.  Edward is trying to explain to her, in terms she will understand, why things are as they are. 
Edward:  There did exist rumors of creatures in these woods.  It is one of the history books I used to teach in the towns. 
Ivy:  The screams?  From the woods?

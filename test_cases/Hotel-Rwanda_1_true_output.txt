He heads for the door. 
INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. DAWN 
Paul steps out, closes the door behind him. A small delegation of the men wait nervously. 
JEAN BAPTISTE It is true. 
He holds up the tiny radio, tuned to the BBC World service, a crackly Brit voice. (It's Gloria the reporter.) 
GLORIA THE REPORTER (O.S.) The Hutu president's plane was struck by a ground-to-air missile as he returned from signing the peace accord with the Tutsi rebels. There were no survivors. The Hutu government has already blamed the Tutsi rebels. The rebels have denied the accusation. Already there are reports of reprisal killings on the streets. 
As they listen, a young woman lets out a SQUEAL, and flees the window where she's been sitting. 
WOMEN (O.S.) They are here. 
Hysteria in the room, women and children push toward the bedroom. Paul manages to make it to the window, nervously steals a glance and sees: 
A HUTU ARMY SOLDIER sits on the high wall by the gate. He pulls another up beside him. 
anic in the room now. Paul turns. 
PAUL Shut up! 
PAUL'S POV: The soldiers drop into his garden. They draw pistols. 
TATIANA (O.S.) What is it, Paul. 
PAUL Stay with the children. 
PAUL'S POV: The soldiers go to the gate, slide the bolt, swing it open. 
Two jeeps, jammed with heavily armed SOLDIERS, sit in the drive like many-limbed beasts of war. Paul watches as the jeeps rumble into his garden. The soldiers jump out. 
INSIDE THE ROOM: 
Nothing can stop the women and children from fleeing into the bedrooms. Paul is frozen at the CRASH of rifles on the door. 
The door gives, SOLDIERS flood in. 
They are startled by the crowd in the living room, rifles raised, SHOUTS. 
SOLDIERS Out, get out now! 
Paul pulls himself together, marches over to the soldier. 
PAUL Who is in charge? 
A Captain is at the door. 
CAPTAIN Who are you? 
PAUL I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu. 
CAPTAIN We are looking for you. 
He takes Paul by the arm, leads him outside. 
EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. DAWN 
The Captain stops by his jeep, studies his clipboard. 
Tatiana with Roger in her arms, her kids and all the neighbors herded together. 
PAUL What is this about? 
CAPTAIN Let me see your identity card. 
Paul pulls it from his pocket, hands it to the Captain. 
CLOSE ON: Paul's ID - it reads Ethnicity: HUTU. 
The Captain studies him, waves for the soldiers to back off. 
CAPTAIN (CONT'D) You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president. 
PAUL Yes, it is a calamity for us all. 
CAPTAIN You work at the Hotel Diplomat? 
PAUL No. I work at the Mille Collines. 
The Captain looks confused. Paul quickly: 
PAUL (CONT'D) I used to work at the Diplomat. 
CAPTAIN Do you know how to open the safe there? (Paul nods) Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it. 
PAUL Of course. 
Paul sees out into the street behind the jeeps: a group of Militia in their colored shirts armed with machetes, have gathered, trying to see what is going on. 
PAUL (CONT'D) Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here. 
CAPTAIN Where is your family? 
Tatiana is beside him now. 
TATIANA (interrupts) This is them. 
Tatiana points to the huddled neighbors. Paul is stunned. 
CAPTAIN All of them! I cannot take them.

SHINZON (turning back to Picard) Yes, I'm sorry, Captain. (he smiles) There's so much we have to talk about. 
PICARD I would be interested to know what we are talking about. 
SHINZON Unity, Captain!  Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people.  Federation and Romulan.  Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman.  I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace. 
Picard and the others are stunned. 
SHINZON I want to end the centuries of mistrust.  I want to be your ally, not your enemy.  As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas. 
PICARD And the Senate supports you? 
SHINZON (dry) I have dissolved the Senate. 
A beat. 
SHINZON Right now, you're thinking this all sounds too good to be true? 
PICARD Yes. 
SHINZON And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed.  Is this the ship of a peacemaker?  Or a predator? (Picard is startled at Shinzon's choice of words) ... But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore.  Above all, you're trying to decide if you can trust me. 
PICARD Yes. 
SHINZON Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion.  Computer, raise lighting four levels. 
Lights shoot up around the room. 
For the first time the crew can see Shinzon clearly.  Picard actually gasps when he sees Shinzon's face.  The rest of the crew doesn't understand his reaction. 
SHINZON Allow me to tell you a story that I hope will clarify my position. When I was very young I was stricken with an odd disease.  I developed a hyper-sensitivity to sound.  The slightest whisper caused me agony... 
Picard watches him carefully.  Wary and strangely intense. 
SHINZON No one knew what to do.  Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome.  Do you know of it, Captain? 
PICARD You know I do. 
The crew is dumbfounded at Picard's unusual reaction. 
SHINZON Then you know it's a very rare syndrome.  Genetic.  All the male members of my family had it. Eventually I was treated.  Now I can hear as well as you can, Captain. 
He steps toward Picard who holds his ground. 
SHINZON I can see as well as you can.  I can feel everything you feel. (He stops right before Picard) In fact, I feel exactly what you feel.  Don't I, Jean Luc? 
Picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and curiosity.  It is as if Picard is looking into a strange, remembered mirror: Shinzon's face is nearly identical to his at that age. 
SHINZON Do you trust me now? 
A beat. 
PICARD We need to talk, just you and I. 
SHINZON Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us.  Or just the one of us. 
PICARD You know I need to verify this. 
SHINZON I know. 
The crew is utterly confused.  Their confusion turns to outright shock when Shinzon calmly pulls out a Reman knife and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood.  He hands the knife to Data. 
SHINZON Tomorrow then, Captain.  We have so much to discuss. 
Picard touches his communicator pin: 
PICARD Picard to Enterprise.  Five to beam out. 
They dematerialize, the shimmering glow illuminating Shinzon's features.  Picard's eyes never leave Shinzon as the transporter effect ripples around him. 
INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY 
Beverly stands with Picard, Riker and Deanna.  The Reman knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical readouts and analysis are visible. 
BEVERLY There's no doubt, Captain.  Right down to your regressive strain of Shalaft's Syndrome.  He's a clone. 
A beat as the confirmation sinks in. 
PICARD When was he... created? 
BEVERLY About twenty-five years ago.  They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell. 
PICARD (touching head) I think a skin cell's the more likely of the two.

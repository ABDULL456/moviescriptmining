(CONTINUING) Why is he mad at me? 
MARY He's looking for answers. He's Upset. 
HORUS (tapping the door) Let me see your eye... (to Mary) I told him about the other cheek. Avoid confrontations... to turn the other cheek. 
MARY .He did. He turned the other cheek and they punched it. 
HORUS 
(PLEADING) Aaron. 
MARY You're late. I'll try again later. Horus finds his hat on the table. His eyes fall on Mary, her back to him. She's glued to the set. 
HORUS ' How... what about you? 
MARY 
(ALOOF) What? Horus turns his focus to the TV - more Hancock FOOTAGE. He watches Mary. 
HORUS Mary? 
MARY Yes. 
.HORUS I... had no idea. 
MARY (on the TV) What could you do? Horns - hat in hand, goes to the door. He wants to stay. 
HORUS (opens door) Good thing he was there. I don't know what I'd do... if you... Mary does not hear him... until the door SHUTS behind her. She turns to face an empty room. 
MARY Coffee's by the... door. 
(GUILTY) Horus? 
INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 
A room, a place we don't know. It's dark save the street light outside. A rhythmic POUNDING reverberates through this darkness. More intense it becomes. And then a high-pitch GASP. Two individuals, man and woman, stumble into view - their silhouettes obscure the window. They're locked at the hips, pumping away like high-revving pistons. For a second, light dances off the woman's aroused face: it's Veronica. 
VERONICA (a her voice trembles) Oh god. The man surfaces from her cleavage for air, his face wet with sweat and saliva. He brushes his cape away from his arm. Veronica uncoils yet another orgasm, her back arched, her breasts beckoning at ceiling. Quite abruptly, he lets her go. Rights his pants. Unlatches the window. She paws after him. 
VERONICA (CONT'D) What'd I do? 
HANCOCK 
(DEJECTED) 'Nothing. I'm sorry. And with that, he floats out into the night. 
VERONICA (dazed; after him) Hancock. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Horus. His walk. Unaware of everything but the storm inside his head. He crosses an alley. A band of THUGS, neighborhood kids of malcontent, surprises him. And. versa. They recoil at his uniform, his gun. They quickly realize that he's rent-a-security. The leader speaks first - he's SCARPO (25), as tough as a steel- belted radial. The others regroup their DRUGS. 
SCARPO Nutri-cop. Horus keeps walking. 
SCARPO (CONT'D) 
(CONTINUING) Look like the Man. Walk like the Man. Shit, ain't half the Man. 
OTHERS Ain't half the Man. Horus simply walks away. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
A streetlight HUMS. Blinks - revealing a deserted alley in' sporadic intervals. Garbage, etc. A slight drizzle shimmers pass the streetlight. Pelts a soulful Hancock below - he moves through the gray dreariness in solitude. 
He reaches behind his e. withdraws a box of cigarettes. Taps himself a stick.

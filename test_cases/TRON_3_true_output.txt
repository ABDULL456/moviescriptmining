The tank heads along a path of circuitry toward a tall, glowing "tower" -- an input/output component. 
32   INTERIOR TANK                                                32 
A red light flashes on the control panel. Clu comes alert and sits up. He stares at the warning. Spot of light that is Bit zips up next to his head. 
CLU Uh oh...we got company. 
BIT (coming into shape again, but red this time) No! 
CLU You said it ... one of those Recognizers comes after me, gonna hafta jump clear out of the data stream. 
CUT TO: 
33   REAL WORLD - INT. FLYNN'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT                  33 
We see Flynn sit up abruptly, and his fingers start flying over the keys. 
34   ELECTRONIC WORLD - EXT. OF TANK                              34 
We see the turret of the tank swivel around. PULL BACK. In the distance is an immense block-like robotic bluish black form, U-shaped, with a small head and a glowing yellow bar for eyes-- a recognizer. It hovers above the ground. 
35   LONG SHOT THROUGH THE TANK PERISCOPE                         35 
A second Reco is coming up behind the first. 
36   INT. OF TANK                                                 36 
CLU (in dismay) Oh my...the long arm o' the law. 
CUT TO: 
37   EXT. LONG SHOT THE TANK                                      37 
FIRES A VOLLEY at the first Reco. That one falls heavily to the ground and the tank speeds up, swiveling around to try to fire at the second Reco, but it moves too fast and can't avoid a gulley. The tank goes in and is stuck - no traction. 
38   CLOSE SHOT - TURRET                                          38 
Clu standing on it. The Bit zips by him, and they both head away from the tank, fast. 
39   LONG SHOT                                                    39 
A glowing static field appears between the two legs of the Recognizer, and it sweeps over the tank, de-rezzing it. We can see more tanks approaching over an edge of the landscape. 
40   CLU                                                          40 
running, looking up as the Reco closes in. We see the dead Reco up ahead, and the streak of the Bit making for it. 
41   CLOSE UP - CLU'S FACE                                        41 
reacting in fear, looking up as the screen GOES TO BLACK. 
CUT TO: 
REAL WORLD 
42   INTERIOR, FLYNN'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT                          42 
SHOT OF THE SCREEN. A complex set of programming figures ends abruptly in a single blue line which prints out across the screen over and over, gradually filling it completely. 
43   SHOT FROM THE SIDE                                           43 
Flynn. 
FLYNN 
Ah, hell...busted again. 
He tries clearing the monitor, but the repeating line just comes right back, monotonously moving across the screen. 
44   SHOT OF THE SCREEN - HOLD as we:                             44 
DISSOLVE TO: 
45   ELECTRONIC WORLD - A LITTLE LATER                            45 
Clu is in electronic energy ring chains, his feet in sockets like Sark's, but this time the energy from the sockets is deadly, torturous. Hovering in front of him is the hologram of the MCP. Beside Clu stands one of the memory guards. 
GUARD Got a pirate program here... says his name's Clu. 
The MPC responds in the manner of a B-movie police sergeant grilling a suspect. 
MCP What'd he pull? 
GUARD Came into the system with a stolen password ... an' we caught him tryin' to raid a high-clearance memory. 
CLU (looks up, his face wracked with pain) No...I must've gotten in there by mistake, I - 
The pain overwhelms him as the energy from the feet sockets momentarily becomes unbearable. 
MCP Who programmed you? 
The guard gives Clu a shove to keep him from losing consciousness.

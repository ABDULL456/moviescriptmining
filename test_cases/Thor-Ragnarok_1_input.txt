QUINJET (V.O.) Access denied. 
THOR Damn you, Stark. (rolls his eyes) Point Break. 
QUINJET (V.O.) Welcome, Point Break. 
CAH-RUNCH! Hulk BARGES IN through the Quinjet door! 
The Hulk approaches, scowling. Any metal that stands in his way PEELS BACK. Frantic, Thor turns to the Quinjet's console. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16              73. 
HULK Friend stay! 
THOR No, no, no! 
As Hulk enters, he DESTROYS the hull of the Quinjet. 
HULK Stay! 
THOR Stop! Stop breaking everything! 
HULK Don't go! 
Thor triggers a message on the flight console. 
NATASHA (V.O.) Nice work, big guy. We don't know where Ultron's headed, but you're going very high, very fast. 
Hulk stops short.    His whole demeanor changes. 
Thor steps out of the way so that Hulk can see a recorded message from NATASHA ROMANOFF on the console. 
NATASHA (V.O.) ...So, I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode... 
Hulk is now right up against the console screen. 
NATASHA (V.O.) ...So I need you to help me out. Okay? I need you to... 
HULK No!     No, Banner! 
Hulk CONVULSES. Drops to his hands and knees. His whole body warping. Hulk ROARS and GRABS at his face, SHAKING his head, trying to fight this back. But he can't help it... 
...HE'S TRANSFORMING BACK INTO BRUCE BANNER! The transition is rough and chaotic, it's as if Banner is fighting to get out of the Hulk. Throughout the process, Hulk SMASHES back and forth, further WRECKING the Quinjet. 
And then, calm. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                 74. 
Thor rushes to Banner's side to help ease the transition. 
THOR Banner. Hey, hey, hey. You all right, Banner? Sun's going down. Sun's going down. That's it, breathe. I won't hurt you. Sun's going down. 
BANNER ...Thor? 
THOR Yeah. 
Banner is groggy, disoriented. Thoughts, memories, and observations begin to flood his brain randomly. 
BANNER What happened to your hair? 
THOR Some creepy old man cut it off. 
BANNER It looks good. 
THOR Thanks. 
BANNER Where are we? How's Nat? 
THOR Nat is good, I'm sure. 
BANNER And what about Sokovia? 
THOR Sokovia? 
BANNER The city, Sokovia.   Did we save it? 
THOR Banner, listen. 
BANNER What? 
THOR Sokovia. Ultron.     That was two years ago. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                75. 
BANNER What are you saying? I've been Hulk for two years? 
THOR I'm afraid so. 
Banner's eyes BULGE.    Trying to process this information. 
BANNER What the hell happened? 
Banner rushes to his feet.      Thor follows. 
THOR Banner, there's something you should know... 
Banner goes to the flight console. 
QUINJET (V.O.) Voice Activation required. 
BANNER Banner. 
QUINJET (V.O.) Welccome, Strongest Avenger. 
THOR (puzzled) What? 
BANNER Ship's log... 
THE SHIP'S LOG POPS UP ON SCREEN.

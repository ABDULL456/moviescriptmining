AGAINST-- 
GREER None of us did! We still don't know. I don't think Strickland even knew-- he thought he was just taking down "the abominations." 
STONE I'm sorry, Greer,. but- - you're suspended, pending further action. Greer nods slowly, knew this was coming. PETERS takes a step back, looking on carefully. Greer takes his LAPTOP COMPUTER off the bedside table, opens it so that Stone can see it. 
GREER I've been going through my memory files of the crash... ever seen anything like this before? ON SCREEN - a magnified CLOSE-UP of the DEVICE in STRICKLAND'S HAND, as he points it upward at the helicopter. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
PETERS It's the murder weapon? GREER nods, STONE studies the laptop, sets his jaw. 
STONE It's more than that. It means nobody is safe. The Dreads want us all to be like them-- living in fear, no better than animals. And we've only just freed ourselves, begun to explore our true potential. 
GREER We need to get this guy. 
STONE We will. Our way of life will be protected, whatever it takes. An attractive SURRIE NURSE enters the room. 
NURSE Good news, Mr. Greer. The doctors say you can go home today. 
GREER (nervous, thrown) They said the end of the week-- 
NURSE Insurance, you know. She smiles, putting his clothing by the bed and disconnecting him from the IV and monitors. 
STONE Just take some time to heal. 
GREER What about my surrogate? 
STONE Hasn't been-recovered. I'm afraid we can't supply you with a new one until this matter is resolved. Peters, make sure he gets home in one piece. PETERS nods, looking at Greer sympathetically. GREER sinks back into his pillow, anxious. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (5) ON MEDICAL MONITOR - the image of GREER'S BRAIN shuts OFF with a BLIP. 
EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - DAY 
PETERS strides from the doors, GREER follows, dressed in casual clothes... then slows his pace, breathing hard. GREER'S POV - CARS zipping past on the street, RUSHING PEDESTRIANS, PARAMEDICS pushing a body past on a gurney. From Greer's now human perspective, surrogates seem artificial, appearance too perfect, eyes empty of souls. This should be reeling, vertiginous. PETERS pauses, seeing Greer is having a panic attack. He has trouble speaking. 
GREER I haven't been out without a surrogate in a long time... 
PETERS It's OK. Nothing's gonna happen. 
GREER They wanted to give me something for the anxiety... they call it corporeaphobia. 
PETERS Just take my arm. He shakes his head, takes a deep breath and moves out onto the sidewalk. Peters stays close. GREER'S POV - SURRIE PEDESTRIANS, moving quickly, seeming to come right. at him. One bumps into him-- GREER staggers, the surrie moves on as if he hasn't even noticed. Greer moves toward the curb to get away from them, stumbles-- PETERS has to pull him out of CAR TRAFFIC, a HORN HONKS. He's sweating, terrified. 
GREER Jesus Christ. 
PETERS We need to get you a replacement. She takes his arm forcibly and moves him away. 
EXT. SURROGATE DISCOUNT STORE - DAY 
A low-end place, BODIES displayed in the windows in their charging bays, SIGNS reading "HURRY 4 A SURRY! GIANT 
SALE! SYNTH UNITS NEW & USED!" PETERS guides GREER inside. 
INT. SURROGATE DISCOUNT STORE - DAY 
COFFIN-SIZED BOXES, SENSORY PROJECTORS and STIM CHAIRS stacked willy-nilly. BRIGHT LIGHTS, VIDEO SCREENS running PROMOS. A slick, blond Aryan SALESMAN approaches with a grin. He sizes GREER up, instantly recognizing signs of withdrawal. He speaks with an incongruous ASIAN 
ACCENT. 
SALESMAN Oh you poor guy-- out in just your skin can be scary. No worries, I got perfect surrie for you. He leads them deeper into the store. He wears a clip-on ID BADGE with the smiling face of a dark-haired ASIAN. RACKS OF ATTRACTIVE MALE and FEMALE BODIES, in skimpy BATHING SUITS-- differing heights and degrees of muscle. GREER looks these over. 
GREER I like to see my own face when I look in the mirror. 
SALESMAN Fine, you no buy off the rack-- we customize, on premise, less than one hour. As they move on, we glimpse CELEBRITY LOOK-ALIKES on the rack-- MARILYN MONROE and ELVIS PRESLEY. LATER - ON COMPUTER SCREEN, a 3-D RENDERING of GREER'S FACE rotates, shows EXPRESSIONS, smiles, frowns-- and speaks. A VOICE-PRINT runs below. 
GREER'S VOICE Hello. Testing-one-two-three... THE SALESMAN works the computer, GREER lies in an uncomfortable STIM CHAIR attached to a_SENSORY PROJECTOR, RED GOGGLES over his eyes and a CAMERA pointed at his face. He seems uneasy. PETERS looks on from nearby.

Emily with Kumail and his friends: CJ and Mary. 
CJ Emily, has Kumail told you that in addition to being an Uber driver he also has a one-man show? 
EMILY No, he did not tell me that.   Do you really? 
KUMAIL It's really nothing. It's just something I'm fiddling around with. 
EMILY How is a one man show different from stand-up? 
KUMAIL It's really not. 
MARY There's lots of wigs and costume changes. 
CJ There's a lot of acting in it. 
MARY And then like at the end of it, you've got this very awkward conversation where you go, "I really liked it." 
KUMAIL But I thought you really liked it! 
MARY I really liked it. 
EMILY I can't wait to see the show. 
KUMAIL You will never see the show... 
CJ You have to see the show. 
MARY You have to see it. 
KUMAIL It's not ready. 
CJ You will love the acting. 
KUMAIL They're fucking with you.   It's not really like that. 
EMILY Are they fucking with me or you? It seems like they're fucking with you. 
INT. PLAYGROUND THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT 
Tiny theater, sparsely attended (Emily, her friend JESSIE, Mary and CJ). On stage is a kid's room. A NINJA TURTLES POSTER, a PRAYER MAT. 
KUMAIL I'm twelve years old. This...this is home. Feels like I never left. Do you smell that? That's my mom cooking the Murgh Roghen Joash. 
CJ (quietly, in the audience) Fuck. 
KUMAIL Do you hear that? That's my father watching cricket on the telly. Do you feel that? That's the weight of Pakistan's history. 
TIME CUT TO: 
A MAP OF PAKISTAN is behind Kumail. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Pakistan was formed when it separated from its biggest rival, India, on August 14th 1947. 
TIME CUT TO:

KUMAIL (CONT'D) Six runs! 
TIME CUT TO: 
Kumail pulls up a diagram of a cricket field. 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) Silly Mid On, Short Mid Wicket, Midwicket, Deep Mid Wicket, Mid On, Long On, Long Off... 
CJ stretches in the audience. 
JESSIE (quietly, from the audience) I have to leave as soon as the show's over. I can't stay. 
Emily nods in understanding. 
KUMAIL So if you get a Silly Mid On fielder, you know you're getting a Yorker soon. 
TIME CUT TO: 
Return to the MAP OF PAKISTAN 
KUMAIL (CONT'D) So to review, Pakistan's biggest exports are cotton and...

TURKISH FINGERS moving up the inside of his legs, onto his belly, touching the hard bulge below the navel. But again not noticing. 
BILLY in limbo, SOUND of his heartbeat. 
SECOND OFFICER pausing, his fingers around Billy's chest, about to let it go, then: 
PLACES HIS HAND suddenly flat on Billy's heart. 
OFFICER, sensing the accelerated Heartbeat, stares at: 
BILLY whose eyes jump, startled by this technique. 
FINGERS like excited spiders quickly run back up into the armpit area.  STOP - right on the packets. 
TURKISH EYES SWIVEL to BILLY EYES CLOSE. Frozen moment. Then, sudden blur of movement at the edge of frame. 
SECOND OFFICER jumping back, grabbing his pistol from his holster, crouching on one knee, aiming the gun barrel at BILLY, hand shaking. He is terrified. 
SECOND OFFICER (screaming) Bomb!  He's got a bomb! 
AMERICAN PASSENGERS scream and the deck all around. 
AMERICAN PASSENGER Bomb!  Bomb! 
BILLY stands there, arms straight up in the air, eyes clamped shut, trying not to breathe. CHORUS of rifle and revolver CLICKS OFF as: 
PULL BACK to OVERHEAD SHOT BILLY surrounded by thirty SOLDIERS with rifles pointed at him from all directions, crouched nervously. The PASSENGERS all huddled on the ground. 
BILLY, eyes closed. Edge of frame shows a shaky muzzle a REVOLVER poked into his belly, moving up. 
MOVE to THE FIRST OFFICER, older, more experienced but scared, poking with the revolver; reaches in with his hand cautiously, starts to pull up the turtleneck sweater. MOVE with the hand, revealing the HASHISH PLAQUES around the navel. A pause. His HAND draws the sweater higher.  More PLAQUES. 
FIRST OFFICER'S FACE relaxes. Starts to smile, finding it funny. 
FIRST OFFICER (yells out) It's hashish. just a smuggler. 
SOLDIERS (OFF) (in chorus echo, relaxing, chuckling) Hashish...smuggler...hippy... 
MASTER ANGLE SOLDIERS REGROUPING. PASSENGERS starting to rise from the ground. 
SUSAN dumbfounded watching all this from the door of the PLANE, starts back down the ramp. But a flow of upcoming PASSENGERS slows her descent. 
BILLY is led roughly by TWO SOLDIERS parallel to the plane his hands on his head. He manages a glance at Susan. A slight but strong movement of the head and eyes. 'No. Don't come down the stairs' 
SUSAN understands it, looks helplessly, hesitates lost between two worlds. A silent shaping of a puzzled mouth. 
SUSAN ...Billy...? 
She is washed back along in the flow of passengers. 
CUT: 
VIP ROOM AIRPORT LOUNGE.  The scene moves very fast, Indicating A sense of chaos.  Much smoke.  Many phone calls. Half A dozen Turkish police OFFICERS Are bizarrely seated In A row of fold up chairs next to A desk. Chattering among themselves (AD LIB) lighting their Turkish cigarettes. They hardly pay attention as: 
MOVE TO BILLY, scared, sweating - backlit by the huge windows overlooking the airstrip. In background, we see the 707 Pan American PLANE beginning to circle towards the runway.  GUARDS have stripped him down to his bare chest and now knife through the adhesive tape from two sides at once. Then RIP the tape off.  BILLY winces. 
ANOTHER ANGLE the room. Billy's luggage Is being Tossed. Clothes fly through the air. A sweatshirt; Marquette University Rowing Team. A 35mm camera. A gift package for his mother ripped open.  A silver Turkish kettle, clanging To The floor. Another package is ripped open and a set of Turkish tea cups smash and break all over the floor. Very fast. 
BILLY watches, bewildered. He is stripped of the last plaque in of the confusion is that each time another police officer 
his navel. FOLLOW the plaque clattering onto the pile of forty plaques. 
FIRSTOFFICER (OFF) Name? 
BILLY (OFF) William Hayes. 
MOVE BACK QUICKLY to the OFFICER with notebook at the desk. Part of the confusion is that each time we see another police officer we see he has another face. 
FIRST OFFICER Vi... Vilyum... Vilyum... 
BILLY (OFF) Hayes. 
FIRST OFFICER Hi-yes... (writes it down) 
ANOTHER ANGLE -- 
FIRST OFFICER 'Merican? 
BILLY (nods) New York. 
The OFFICER is puzzled. 
BILLY New York... New York... 
FIRST OFFICER Ahhhh...Nev Yok! (writes it down) 
A LOUD SOUND OFF.

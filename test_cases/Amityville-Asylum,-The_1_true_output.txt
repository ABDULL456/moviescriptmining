RONALD SENIOR He needs some fuckin' discipline!! 
LOUISE Stay away from him!! 
Suddenly Ronald Senior feels cold metal pressed against the back of his head. Louise SCREAMS and steps back. Ronald Senior freezes. Ronald Senior slowly turns to see Butch, his eyes bloodshot and his face emotionless, aiming a MARLIN RIFLE at his head. 
BUTCH I've had enough of you fat man!! 
LOUISE Ronnie, don't!! Please!! 
Ronald Senior's trembles with fear as he stares into his son's cold eyes. Butch places his finger on the trigger. 
LOUISE No!! 
Butch pulls the trigger. Louise SCREAMS. The gun JAMS. Ronald Senior breathes a sigh of relief. Butch lowers the gun and storms off towards the basement. Louise embraces Ronald Senior, who appears to be in shock. 
CUT TO: 
67.INT. LANDING ­ 112 OCEAN AVENUE ­ LATER 
Butch is quietly stalking the landing. He can hear whispers from his parents' bedroom and cranes his neck to listen. 
RONALD SENIOR (O.S) I want him out of this house tomorrow. He's gone. 
LOUISE (O.S) I guess you're right. He's twenty three now, he just doesn't belong here any more. 
RONALD SENIOR (O.S) His age ain't the problem Louise, those goddamn drugs he's taking are. I'm not having that going on under my roof. 
LOUISE (O.S) We'll talk to him tomorrow. 
RONALD SENIOR (O.S) The time has come. And it's long over due. 
Ronald stands upright. Behind him is a FIGURE in a black robe. 
FIGURE Kill them before they kill you. 
CUT TO BLACK

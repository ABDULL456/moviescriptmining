NURSE Emily! 
MILES What are you... (To the nurse) Is she yours? 
WOMAN Howard Doyle is my brother? You know my brother, Howard Doyle. You do know my brother, don't you? 
NURSE I'm sorry, Sir. Emily. Give the man back. 
MILES Yes, I know Howard Doyle. 
WOMAN He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you. (singsong) Neener neener neener. 
INT. RUTH RABINOW'S OFFICE 
Ruth calmly watches Miles ranting around her office. 
MILES He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick -- 
RUTH Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her. 
MILES He never ate the pre-nup, did he! 
RUTH I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician. 
MILES Did Marylin end up with money? 
RUTH She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup. 
MILES I don't have a pre-nup 
Miles hangs his head. Ruth sighs sympathetically. 
RUTH ...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars... 
MILES Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap. 
RUTH And it's good! 
MILES I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred. 
RUTH Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal. 
MILES ...why did she do it, Ruth? Why? 
RUTH That's attorney client privilege. (As she goes back into her work) Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose -- 
INT. MASSEY HOUSE - NIGHT 
Marylin greets him at the door. 
MARYLIN Hi. 
MILES Hello Marylin. 
MARYLIN I have a surprise for you. 
MILES I bet. 
She brings him inside. The place has been massively accessorized. Antiques, rugs, lamps and assorted tasteful chatchkies. There is a new Biedermeyer couch in the den. 
MARYLIN Ta Da. 
Miles looks at it, expressionless. 
MARYLIN You don't like it? 
He stares at her -- a very dark look. 
MARYLIN You don't like me? 
MILES (Flatly) I love you. I want to have your baby. 
MARYLIN What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?

EXT. OUTSIDE NASA - RAVE - NIGHT 
This is the line to Nasa. People are lined up and down the block waiting to get inside. All the kids are wearing rave clothing which resembles clown suits with stack shoes and huge colorful hats. It looks like a hip-hop circus. 
Jennie is walking quickly past everyone on line. She comes to the front. 
SID, a short gay Chinese boy with orange hair, is carrying a clipboard guest list under his arm and has a Sesame Street purse in his other hand. When he sees Jennie, he walks up and unclips the rope. 
SID Jennie! Was up girl? 
Sid bends over and gives Jennie a kiss. 
JENNIE Hi Sid. 
After Jennie walks in, Sid reclips the rope. 
Jennie walks up the stairs and past the security guards and metal detectors. 
SECURITY GUARD Hi Jennie. 
Jennie smiles and walks by. 
Nasa is like a giant warehouse. It has hallways and rooms. Kids invade every inch of the club. 
As Jennie walks in, the Techno music grows very loud. The music should sound as if you were stuck in a fast-paced video game. 
Kids are running around everywhere. The CAMERA follows Jennie through the club as if it is seeing everything Jennie sees. 
The dance floor is packed with kids holding flashlights and sucking on pacifiers. 
As she walks through the darkened hallways, people are against the walls making out. 
As she gets to the end of the hallway, there is a big crowd of people. She jumps to see what everyone is looking at. 
FIDGET, a short white guy who is very hyper and speaks very quickly, runs up to Jennie and grabs her wrist. 
FIDGET Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel? 
JENNIE Fine Fidget. What's all this? 
FIDGET Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle. 
Fidget pulls Jennie through the crowd. 
FIDGET Now look at that. Amazing sexual exploration. 
There are three girls and one boy making out against the back wall. The boy is wearing an afro wig. They all have their clothes on, but they are all going at it like crazy. 
Two of the girls are making out with each other while they rub the boy. The other girl is kissing the boy while he is feeling on her body. 
Jennie looks surprised. The other kids are laughing and yelling at them. 
One of the girls making out looks at the crowd and sticks her tongue out. 
GIRL You don't have to look at us. It's not a free show. 
She continues making out. 
Everyone laughs. The music is loud and adds to the intensity of the scene. 
JENNIE Who are they? 
FIDGET I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin the effex. 
Fidget looks at Jennie, she looks depressed. 
FIDGET Come on Jennie. Jen.

TRILLIAN And what if I run into one of those things? 
Finnegan tosses her a pulse rifle from the overturned crate. 
FINNEGAN Don't forget the safety. 
She hits the safety, slams a shell into chamber... 
TRILLIAN Don't take too long...I'm not planning on being on the menu tonight. 
...and exits. 
PANTUCCI (razzing) I've never seen you so congenial with a member of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport... 
FINNEGAN And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening. 
Finnegan attaches a wire to a sprocket. A red light starts to blink on the warhead.

131     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      131 
It is VERY DARK. The RAIN is getting worse. THUNDER RUMBLES. LIGHTNING FLASHES. The FUJI MARU MOANS and CREAKS. BUBBLES EXPLODE from beneath it. The Saipan rocks against her hull. Trillian clambers along the TILTING RAILING, heading for the watersports platform. Her gorgeous eyes shift nervously. 
TRILLIAN I'm going to be OK...I'm going to be 
OK... The ship's METAL HULL SCREECHES. The SEAWATER BUBBLES and GURGLES. From somewhere deep inside the ship, we HEAR that loud primordial YOWL again. Trillian freezes, her heart double beats. She looks around, really scared. 
CUT TO: 
132     SAIPAN'S HOLD - NIGHT                                  132 
The missile is on a hoist being pushed forward by Pantucci and Finnegan toward a GAPING HOLE in the PORT BOW. 
PANTUCCI You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out... 
FINNEGAN A little to the left... 
PANTUCCI I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next... 
FINNEGAN Line it up now, nice and easy... 
The missile head is right in line with the hole in the bow. 
PANTUCCI I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought. 
FINNEGAN I have been. 
PANTUCCI And what have you come up with? 
FINNEGAN How does an island sound to you? 
Pantucci looks at Finnegan quizically. This is news to him. 
CUT TO: 
133     SAIPAN - NIGHT                                         133 
The TIP of the WARHEAD creeps out through the hole. The body of the missile is just a hair too wide, which is good, because it jams itself nice and tight into the hole. 
CUT TO: 
134     WATERSPORT PLATFORM - NIGHT                            134 
Trillian takes the tarp off the remaining jet ski. Pushes the swivel arm that holds it out over the railing. The PLATFORM TILTS! Trillian loses her balance. Almost goes over the side. Just barely manages to catch herself. Hangs there for a moment. Something SWISHES in the water below her. Trillian's EYES scan the darkness; scared sick. 
CUT TO: 
135     THE SAIPAN'S PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT                       135 
Finnegan LASHES the STEERING-STICKS as hard left as they'll go. The rudder locks tight. Pantucci enters. 
PANTUCCI I gerry-rigged the ignition...all you gotta do is start her up...it won't go fast but it'll go loud... 
Trillian's scream tears through the night. Finnegan's eyes go to the Fuji Maru. He kicks open a box by the side of the console, and pulls out a sawed off shot gun with a pistol handle in a holster.

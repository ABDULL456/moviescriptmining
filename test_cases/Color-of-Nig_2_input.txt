CREDITS 
Credits start on a black screen, then they continue during the whole scene at Michelle's place, and they end at the beginning of the scene at Bill Capa's office. 
MICHELLE'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY 
Close-up on a silver lipstick stand made into a bad taste musical box. We see Michelle's hand selecting a lipstick then we see Michelle putting the lipstick on her lips, seated in front of the mirror of her dressing table. She is dressed in a green frock, and her face shows that she is quite disturbed. Her apartment's decoration is very heavy, with a lot of various useless objects and gold-plated furniture and many mirrors. She looks for a new dress in her wardrobe, and get mad at not finding it. She then goes to a sofa covered with cushions, which she throws all around the place, still madder at not finding her dress. A cat, who was lying on the armrest of the sofa, runs away hurriedly from the mad Michelle. 
MICHELLE God !...... No !...... 
Michelle is back in front of the mirror of her dressing-table. She takes the lipstick and put a lot of it on her lips, then on her teeth, then all around her mouth. She makes faces to herself in the mirror. She seems more and more disturbed. She takes a chrome-plated revolver in her drawer, starts to put it in her purse, then takes it out, spins the cylinder of the revolver, and puts the revolver in her mouth, as if she wanted to kill herself. But instead, she starts sucking the barrel, while she strokes the revolver in a quite erotic way. 
BILL CAPA' OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY 
Large planes of ground glass. We hear, without understanding them, some voices and laughs. Then a male voice becomes more understandable... 
BILL'S VOICE So who do you think is the enemy ?... No, no, give me a specific answer... 
... then Michelle appears on the screen. She is dressed in a green suit, she is heavily made up, et she still seems very disturbed. The office is very chic and evidently belongs to a very rich New- York psycho-analyst. Beautiful and good taste furniture. Shelves with leather-bound books. 
MICHELLE You are the goddamned enemy, Capa, you and this all tower of psycho-babble. You know what I hope ? That God gets real pissed off and He shrivels up your cock, so that it points straight down to Hell, where you belongs !... 
During this reply, Bill Capa has appeared on the screen. He is seated. He is wearing a long-sleeve shirt, a necktie, but no jacket. He laughs at Michelle's last sentence. 
BILL OK... Michelle, so you will become His Avenging Angel, and swoop down to finish me off. He stands up. 
MICHELLE Now, I finally get it : you're are like my ex-husband. You think that everything got to be either black or white because you got color-blind. But God is on my side now. He knows I'm not like you 
BILL Well, we are pretty much the same, Michelle. We all do it. 
MICHELLE We all do what ? 
BILL Tend to view our lives as we were looking through a keyhole. I's a very limited view of the truth. So, we have to fill in the blanks. We invent things. 
MICHELLE I don't know what you mean. 
BILL You invent enemies to test your strength against. You invent gods to protect you from these enemies. 
MICHELLE Cutting him. What a depressing view of life you have, that is such horse-shit ! 
BILL Who is the enemy ? One minute you have friends, the next moment they've slipped away. You leave here and I wonder who is Michelle really hating this week. I try to remember and I can't bring it to mind. Do you know why ? 
MICHELLE No, why don't you tell me 
BILL Take a look in the mirror, Michelle 
MICHELLE Which mirror ?... This mirror ?... 
BILL Any mirror. Tell me what you see. 
MICHELLE We see Michelle as if we were watching her from behind the mirror. I see... I see your reflection over my shoulder... I see... there is nothing much that I really like... I think I prefer the view outside actually... 
During this last reply, Bill, standing up, is fidgeting with something on his desk. At Michelle's last words, he turns toward her, looking alarmed. But he doesn't have time to do prevent her from breaking through the glass pane and jumping outside. He yells «Michelle» twice. 
A STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY 
We see Michelle's body falling all the way down. Capa's office must be around the 25th floor. The body crashes on the street. A police horse, who was near the impact, rears up in fright. As if the asphalt were translucent, we see Michelle's body from underneath, with the blood flowing around it. 
SEVERAL VOICES All right, get back there... Stay back !... Get back in your car... Stop it... 
BILL CAPA'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY 
We see Bill with tears in his eyes. He walks to the broken window, and look outside. 
BILL Voice over. My God, it was the reddest blood I ever saw, poured around her green dress. And... Then the red disappeared...

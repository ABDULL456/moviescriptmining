DACK Feeling all right, sir? 
LUKE Just like new, Dack.  How about you? 
DACK Right now I feel like I could take on the whole Empire myself. 
LUKE (quietly, strapping in) I know what you mean. 
EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN 
A thin horizon line cuts across the bleak landscape.  Small dot-size objects begin to appear on the horizon, moving in the direction of the Rebel base. 
EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH 
A Rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his eyes.  Through the lens he sees a very close view of a giant Imperial snow walker.  He adjusts the view which then zooms back to reveal three more of the ominous battle machines.  Small flashes of yellow fire billow from the guns of the lumbering snow walkers. 
The officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic pounding begins to make the ground vibrate.  The pounding grows louder and is accompanied by a high-pitched, metallic rattling.  The officer speaks into his comlink. 
TRENCH OFFICER Echo Station Three-T-Eight. 
INT. REBEL BASE - CORRIDOR 
Pilots and gunners race to their waiting snowspeeders.  Ice and snow begin falling from the walls of the corridor, shaken by the pounding Imperial snow walker as they draw ever nearer. 
TRENCH OFFICER (over comlink) We have spotted Imperial walkers! 
CONTROLLER Imperial walkers on the north ridge. 
EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH 
The Rebel troops aim their weapons at the horizon as explosions erupt all around them.  They are nervous and their grip on their weapons tightens from the cold and from fear. 
Behind the troops a dozen snowspeeders race through the sky. 
INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT 
LUKE (into comlink) Echo station Five-Seven.  We're on our way. 
EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD 
The fleet of snowspeeders races above the ice field at full throttle. They accelerate away from the base and head toward the distant walkers. 
INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT 
LUKE (into comlink) All right, boys, keep tight now. 
DACK Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set. 
LUKE Steady, Dack.  Attack pattern delta.  Go now! 
EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD 
The cannons mounted on the walker head fire at the speeders.  Other walkers loom in the background.  Two speeders race away past two of the enormous walkers and bank to the right. 
INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT 
LUKE All right, I'm coming in. 
He turns his speeder and heads directly at one of the walkers, flying toward its towering legs.  The horizon twists as the speeder banks between the legs. 
LUKE (into comlink) Hobbie, you still with me? 
EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD 
Two speeders race directly at the head of a walker, then split and fly past it. 
Three other walkers march onward, firing all cannons. 
EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOWTRENCH 
Rebel troops fire on the approaching walkers, as the snow and ice explode all around them. 
EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD 
A speeder banks through and away from the legs of a walker.  Two other speeders pass the first speeder from the opposite direction.  Other Rebel craft race just above the icy plain. 
A giant walker head swivels and fires, striking a snowspeeder and sending it crashing in a ball of flames. 
INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT 
General Veers and two walker pilots keep a careful eye on the racing Rebel snowspeeders as they maneuver their lumbering war machine forward. 
Luke's speeder banks in from the side of Veers's walker and heads straight for its viewport, blasting away.  An explosion hits the walker window, but dissipates, doing no harm.  The speeder roars up and over the impregnable war machine. 
INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT 
Luke looks back at the walker as it grows smaller in the distance.

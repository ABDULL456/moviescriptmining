DJANGO'S VOICE (OS) Hey Snowball. 
: Stephen looks up at Django on Tony. 
DJANGO If you wanna know who I am, or the name of my horse, you ask me. 
STEPHEN Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball, horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud. 
CALVIN CANDIE Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it funny. Django's a Freeman. Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django. 
STEPHEN This nigger, here? 
CALVIN CANDIE That nigger there. Let me at least introduce the two of. you. Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen. Stephen, this is Django. You two should hate each other. Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the blacks at Candyland. 
STEPHEN Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you feel the need to entertain? 
CALVIN CANDIE Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz are customers, and they are our guests Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard... .are to show them every hospitality. Do you understand that? 
STEPHEN I don't know why I gotta - 
CALVIN CANDIE You don't hafta know why, do you understand? 
STEPHEN Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine. 
CALVIN CANDIE Good. They're spending the night. Go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready. 
STEPHEN 
(POINTING AT 
DJANGO) He's gonna stay in the Big House? 
CALVIN CANDIE Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different. 
STEPHEN 
(INCREDULOUS) In the Big House? 
CALVIN CANDIE You gotta problem with that? 
STEPHEN I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta problem with burin' the bed, the sheets, and the pillow cases once this black ass motherfuckers gone! 
CALVIN CANDIE That's my problem, they're mine to burn. Your problem, right now, is making a good impression. And I want you to start solving that problem right now, and git them rooms ready. The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says; 
STEPHEN Yes sir, Monsieur Candie. Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself. Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a FAT MAMMY named CORA, comes up to her brother on his horse. 
CALVIN CANDIE Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle is my widowed sister, may I present to you, Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly. Lara Lee does a southern lady bow. Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner. Dr.SCHULTZ I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd Django, (Django tips his hat) and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony. Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow. 
Dr.SCHULTZ And it is our great delight to encounter this flaming rose. 
LARA LEE Well aren't you the charming gentlemen. You're not from around here, are you? Dr.SCHULTZ Actually I'm from a far off land, Dusseldorf, to be exact. 
CALVIN CANDIE These two are in the market for a fightin' nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down, show 'em my stock. 
LARA LEE We'll all have dinner tonight, right? 
CALVIN CANDIE Half the reason I invited them. I thought you'd find.them as intriguing as I do little sister. Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles. All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older one, and two tough looking younger ones. The'older one is the Cap't of the Overseers, ACE WOODY, and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits. As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to Dr.Schultz and Django, and says; 
CALVIN CANDIE You know since I started fightin' niggers about eleven years ago, it's been a new lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here now is the man responsible for all my success. Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust. Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and Schultz. 
CALVIN CANDIE Howdy Ace. 
(TO SCHULTZ 
AND DJANGO) This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and nigger fight trainer extraordinaire, Ace Woody. 
Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody. 
CALVIN CANDIE And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells Cody. 
(TO ACE) Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and Django Freeman, they're big customers with big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I brought 'em out here so you could give 'em a little display of our African flesh. Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them.

NIKKI Sure! Trains de luxe is what we like. 
The whistle BLOWS. Cary panics. 
CARY Hey! He's blowing the whistle. (grabs Shep's shoulder) Hey, we're gonna start. 
SHEP Well, let her start. 
The trains starts. Bill jauntily throws his hat up to the luggage rack above and the others settle in for their journey. 
BILL Let 'er go Gallagher. Who cares?! 
FRANCIS Who cares?! 
SHEP Who cares?! 
NIKKI Who cares?! 
Frink enters casually. 
FRINK Hello, everybody. 
Cary is stunned. Frink sits down with the others. 
CARY And you, too? 
FRINK That's right. 
The group takes in the train's departure with perfect composure. Cary stands and looks at them for a moment before breaking into a understanding grin. 
CARY That's right. Who cares? 
Cary sits. As the train hurtles out of the now empty station, Nikki suddenly turns to the window and waves goodbye to no one at all: 
NIKKI Goodbye! Goodbye! Don't forget to write! 
Shep, Bill and Francis quickly join in, waving and shouting goodbye, much to Cary's amusement. Even Frink manages a smile at this. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE TRAIN'S WHEELS racing down the track. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CARY'S COMPARTMENT - IN THE HEAT OF THE EVENING The compartment doorway. We hear the men laughing. Bill -- drink in hand, his necktie loosened and his coat off -- appears in the doorway, coming from the train's corridor. 
BILL Hi, men! Look what I found. 
With a grand gesture, Bill presents an elderly British gentleman who follows him into the little room, greeted with a cheer of "Hooray!" from the men who sit around, similarly coatless (save Frink), smoking and drinking. 
Various bottles stand on a central table. The old gentleman is greeted warmly but it's never clear whether he is an old friend or a total stranger. 
SHEP Come in. 
FRANCIS Sit down. 
CARY Have a drink. 
GENTLEMAN Ah, thank you, no, not I. 
Bill and the old gentleman sit down. Nikki dozes in her seat by the window. The basket of turtles hangs from above. 
GENTLEMAN I - I say, are you all going to Portugal? 
SHEP Yup. We're going down there to investigate conditions. 
GENTLEMAN Investigate conditions? 
BILL Drinking conditions, mostly. 
SHEP By the way, what ARE conditions? 
GENTLEMAN Don't you know what conditions are? 
SHEP No. Never saw one in my life. 
BILL The drinking conditions are pretty bad right here. 
GENTLEMAN (chuckles skeptically, glancing at the bottles) Ahh, indeed. 
BILL My beer's full of cinders. 
CARY Good for ya. Make ya lay hard-shelled eggs. 
The men laugh. A whistle BLOWS. The conductor appears briefly in the doorway to announce in French that the mademoiselle's compartment is ready.

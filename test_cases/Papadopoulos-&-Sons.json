No one else is eating and the table is set for one. The dining room is spartan - less furniture/ no pictures. We see some tea crates stuffed with tissue wrapped objects. \nSPIROS It was so strange. Oh, James - more lemon son. \nJAMES passes SPIROS a small plate of quartered lemons. SPIROS sticks his fork into one and squeezes juice over his chicken. \nSPIROS (CONT'D) Oh. This is so good Mrs P. In all the years, I never stopped thinking about you or your food. \nMRS PARRINGTON Still so charming. \nSPIROS So, I'm sitting there watching the telly and suddenly I see Papadopoulos & Sons.

It's only temporary. I'm in negotiations with a top corporate finance team to buy it back. But in the meantime, I need to free up some capital. \nSPIROS I'll give you whatever I've got but you know, I don't have much money. \nHARRY I don't want your money Spiro. I want to sell the Three Brothers. We'll split it 50/50. I get enough money pay the rent, pay a few bills off and it's great for you because you get some cash to do whatever it is you want to do. \nSPIROS You can't sell the Three Brothers. \nHARRY I knew it! I knew you'd be difficult. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. You haven't changed. \nSPIROS No, it doesn't feel right. \nHARRY You're loving this. \nSPIROS No Harry.

SPIROS addresses them. \nSPIROS I couldn't sleep last night. Not a wink. Over and over, in my mind, I was trying to imagine selling the shop. Something here was saying, no, no. I want to help you. All of you. So I prayed for guidance. I asked the Universe. Please help me. Please help me help these people. And I must've fallen asleep not long after. A crazy sleep. And then this dream. Banayia mou. There was this, this music. The most incredible music. And you and me Harry. Running the shop. I woke with tears in my eyes and I knew. \nHARRY Sorry.

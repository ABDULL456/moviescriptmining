{"train": "PAPADOPOULOS & SONS \nWritten by \nMarcus Markou \nFinal Version with Dialogue Changes \nMusic. Zorba - the Ballet by the Hungarian State Symphony. Classical and uplifting. \nCUT TO: \n1   EXT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - GARDEN. DAY 1.                   1 \nA very English scene - a beautiful English garden belonging to a mansion house. A smartly turned out gardener in green overalls is raking leaves. It's an impressive picture of Britishness and order. Another gardener, DAVE is trimming the edge of the lawn. We see shots of the garden; plants, trees, a gazebo, sundial, water fountain etc. We follow one of the gardeners pushing a wheelbarrow across the width of the lawn and we see the rear of this impressive property. \nTitle: 'PAPADOPOULOS & SONS' \nCUT TO: \n2   INT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - INTERIOR. DAY 1.                 2 \nMRS PARRINGTON knocks on a bedroom door. The door opens on HARRY PAPADOPOULOS in his bedroom doing up his shirt in a mirror. \nCUT TO: \n3   EXT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - DRIVEWAY. DAY 1.                 3 \nA chauffeur-driven Mercedes pulls up to the front of the mansion house. MRS PARRINGTON, the housekeeper and nanny, waits for the car. HARRY and his children, JAMES, KATIE and THEO exit through the front door. As they do so, MRS PARRINGTON makes sure the children are smartly turned out. The chauffeur gets out and opens the door for the children. CUT TO: \n4   EXT. CAR MONTAGE. DAY 1.                                     4 \nWe see the car make its way through London and images of the City, the Gherkin, NatWest Tower, Canary Wharf. The Mercedes pulls up outside a hotel. \nCUT TO: \n5   INT. LONDON HOTEL - AWARDS CEREMONY. DAY 1.                  5 \nA PRESENTER is standing behind a lectern, with a large crystal vase award. Behind him, on the stage, we see a 'European Entrepreneur of the Year Award' banner. \nPRESENTER Orphaned when he was just a boy, Harry Papadopoulos came to this country with nothing. \n(CONTINUED) \n5   CONTINUED:                                                 5 \nWe cut to the family seated at a round table. The children look bored. HARRY listens proudly. \nPRESENTER (CONT'D) Harry was a grafter, entering the restaurant trade as a young man. (Beat) That's a euphemism for 'Greek waiter' isn't it? \nThere is some laughter in the audience. We cut to HARRY again, who attempts to smile off the joke. \nPRESENTER (CONT'D) Only joking Harry. He then started the now famous Papadopoulos & Sons - doing all things Greek. From taramasalata to olive oil and frozen mousakas - which, I must admit, my wife and I are partial to occasionally. Not one to settle, Harry's made the move into commercial property where he's about to embark on one of the most audacious developments yet - Papadopoulos Plaza. A two million square foot redevelopment in the heart of our great city. (Applause from the audience) Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you European Entrepreneur of the Year. Harry Papadopoulos. \nAwards music. We now cut to HARRY getting up from the table. He momentarily acknowledges the applause. The children are clapping politely but absently. \nCUT TO: 6   INT. LONDON HOTEL - SMALL FUNCTION SUITE. DAY 1.           6 \nDAVE Oh no. Best not. Got some dinner at home. That's a nice vase, isn't it? \nHARRY European Entrepreneur of the Year. \nDAVE That's impressive. \nJAMES Dave. Did you g.. g.. get my cuttings? \nDAVE I did mate. It's in the greenhouse. I got you a Caryopteris and a Philadelphus. JAMES Cheers man. Thank you. \nDAVE See you later. \nJAMES See you tomorrow. \nDave exits. \nTHEO Daddy? What did Papadopoulos & Sons borrow for the property development? \nHARRY About three hundred million. \nMRS PARRINGTON shuts and removes THEO's laptop. \n(CONTINUED) \n7   CONTINUED: (2)                                             7 \nMRS PARRINGTON Never mind the trials and tribulations of the stock market. Finish your supper young man. \nTHEO Nanny P! \nMRS PARRINGTON Eat up or there'll be no pudding. I've made you a nice sponge. \nTHEO pulls a childish grimace and starts to breath heavily through his nose. \nTHEO Two, Four, Eight, 16... \nHARRY Alright. \nTHEO Thirty two, sixty four, 128.. \nHARRY That's enough. \nTHEO Something is happening with interbank lending Daddy! \nHARRY Alright. We'll talk about it tomorrow. \nHARRY gets up from the table. HARRY (CONT'D) It's going to be a long summer. \nHARRY exits. \nMRS PARRINGTON Taking them to a business awards ceremony is hardly a family day out. My suggestion was a cottage in Lyme Regis. \nCUT TO: \n8   INT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - HALLWAY. EVENING 1.              8 \nDAVE is at the front door in the hallway. He is putting on his muddy boots. HARRY enters. \nJAMES' room resembles a botanical garden. JAMES is at his desk with pots of plants and various tools and test tubes with soil and desk lamps. JAMES looks through a microscope, studying a leaf, ignoring his father. HARRY surveys the room trying to accommodate his son's interest in botany. He notices a poster of Charles Darwin with a quote. He reads it out. \nHARRY(CONT'D) It is not the strongest to survive, nor the most intelligent but those adaptable to change. Fascinating. Charles Darwin. (Latching onto a random plant) Ah. Look at that. (Beat) And that's... \nJAMES answers without looking up from the microscope. \nJAMES Did you know, that the average garden contains over three and a half million species? \nHARRY No, I didn't. \nJAMES Dad. I'm not going back to... \n(CONTINUED) \n9   CONTINUED:                                                 9 \nHARRY But it's only a year and then you've got a law degree. \nJAMES I've no intention of running P.. P.. Papadopoulos & Sons. I can't even pronounce it. \nHARRY Look. Finish your studies. The plants. It's a hobby. Sure. Give yourself options. You may change your mind about the business. You know, there are a lot of creative roles now in business. \nJAMES Like what? \nHARRY Like marketing. Alright. Defer the final year. Take a year out, why not? Fine. But don't quit. Your mother would have said the same. \nJAMES Would she? \nHARRY Well, your mother would probably have said do what you feel was right but I'd argue she was wrong. And then we'd argue. Probably. And she'd win. That was your mother. At least consider deferring. JAMES thinks about it. \nJAMES Okay. I'll consider deferring. \nHARRY Yeah? Great. Great. So, there you are, it's not a definitely not? \nHARRY wants to bond but doesn't know where to start. HARRY latches onto an English Ivy in a Union Jack plant pot. \nHARRY (CONT'D) What's this one called? \nJAMES It's an ivy. \nThe doorbell rings. \n(CONTINUED) \n9    CONTINUED: (2)                                             9 \nHARRY Mrs P!(Pause, waits for a response) Mrs P! Look, I'd better. \nHARRY goes to exit and then comes back to shake his son's hand. \nHARRY (CONT'D) Hey. Well done. For. You know. \nHARRY heads towards the door and just before he exits he gives an emphatic double thumbs up. \nHARRY CONT Closed? \nJAMES Yes please. \nHARRY I'm not going to say that word. \nDOOR KNOCKER Why not? \nHARRY Because it's a silly word and I don't know what it's for and I don't know if you're genuine. And I'll probably never use it. \nCUT TO: \n11   INT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - KITCHEN. EVENING 1.           11 \nHARRY walks in with the entire box of cleaning products and hands them to MRS PARRINGTON. \nMRS PARRINGTON Oh. A shammy. \nTHEO Come look Daddy. \nOn the TV, we see a 'New Bank Crisis?' banner and a reporter standing outside a bank in the city of London. \nHARRY Turn it up. THEO points the remote and turns up the volume. \nNEWS REPORTER Panic confusion and chaos. They said it couldn't happen again but today it just did sending shock waves through the world's markets. \nHARRY What's going on? \nTHEO Another bank collapse. \nThe TV images cut to people leaving an office with boxes of their belongings. \nNEWS REPORTER VO (CONT) All 8,000 members of staff have been asked to leave while the bank is put into liquidation. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n11   CONTINUED:                                                11 NEWS REPORTER VO (CONT) (CONT'D) It comes as a shock but not a surprise. \nHARRY's mobile phone rings. He answers. \nHARRY Nicholas. I'm watching now. It's insane. I don't know. Why don't you call them? Alright. I'll see you first thing tomorrow. Bye. \nTHEO Will this have repercussions on your loan? \nHarry is lost in thought. \nMRS PARRINGTON That's a very good word Theo. Isn't it? Daddy? Repercussions. (Beat) It's a good word. \nHARRY Oh yes. Sorry. Yes. It's a very good word. \nCUT TO: \n12   EXT. PAPADOPOULOS & SONS FACTORY. DAY 2.                    12 \nNext morning. Establishing shot. We are at the Papadopoulos & Sons HQ - the exterior of the factory. \nCUT TO: 13   INT. PAPADOPOULOS & SONS FACTORY OFFICE. DAY 2.             13 \nHARRY, FAT LAKI and NICHOLAS are walking into the office. \nFAT LAKI They've revalued the property. They're calling in the guarantees. You need to find thirty mil now. Six months to find the rest. \nHARRY And if we don't? What happens? \nROB Put something offshore, I said. He wanted to pay his taxes. \nHARRY Maybe I should have been more Greek about it. \nROB Hey. It's bankruptcy baby. Not disaster. \n(CONTINUED) \n13   CONTINUED: (3)                                            13 \nHARRY Accountants. When it's good, they get paid. When it's bad, they get paid. I want my son to be a lawyer for the same reason. He doesn't get it. So what are the options? \nROB Well, the obvious is to buy back your own business. \nSOPHIE Trick is finding the investors to back you. \nHARRY And the banks will sell back to me because? \nROB Because nobody makes pink slop like you do Harry. \nSOPHIE The banks just want a quick sale. They have no interest in running your business. \nHARRY Let's jump on it. \nROB I'll talk to private equity firms, VCs, angels. The usual suspects. We'll find someone. SOPHIE What doesn't break you, makes you. \nHARRY Ah. Therapy. Don't charge me for that, will you? Rob? Don't let her charge me for that. \nCUT TO: \n14   INT. PAPADOPOULOS & SONS FACTORY OFFICE. DAY 2               14 \nHARRY walks through his office and down to the factory floor where he overlooks a small army of oblivious Papadopoulos & Sons employees processing taramasalata into containers. \nCUT TO: \n15   EXT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - DRIVEWAY. DAY 3.                 15 \nMusic continues. We see the front of the house. A standard removal truck is parked outside alongside the Mercedes and a Bentley sports car - displaying (PAPA 1 and PAPA 2 number plates). Two removal men in white overalls and white gloves (almost forensic looking) walk out the front door carrying a large oil painting. A third man stands at the back of the van waiting to receive goods. \nCUT TO: \n16   INT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - HALLWAY. DAY 3.                  16 \nKATIE walks down the stairs and we see removal men assessing the valuables of the house. \nCUT TO: \n17   INT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - KITCHEN. DAY 3.                  17 \nThe family, including MRS PARRINGTON, are in the kitchen. THEO is on his laptop. KATIE nervously files her nails. MRS PARRINGTON has made everyone a cup of tea. HARRY is reading a newspaper. JAMES is reading a book. KATIE enters. \nKATIE They're going through my things. It's disgusting. \nHARRY Are they darling. It's temporary. You'll get it all back. \nTwo bank assessors RUPERT and NIGEL enter. RUPERT has a clipboard with items to be ticked off. NIGEL has a camera. RUPERT Morning. \nKATIE (Whispering) Thank you! \nRUPERT Nigel. \nNIGEL You seem like such a lovely family. We hate doing this. \nRUPERT Nigel. \nHARRY Right, so 25k cash. And 1000 in personal items. What else? RUPERT Ah. Well. One thing that came up in the meeting with HQ this morning. The fish and chip shop. The Three Brothers? \nJAMES What fish and chip shop? \nMRS PARRINGTON That went years ago. \nRUPERT Well, the bank is unable to seize it as an asset because of its co- ownership with a... Spiros Papadopoulos? \nHARRY Right. \n(CONTINUED) \n17   CONTINUED: (3)                                            17 \nMRS PARRINGTON Yes, that's his brother. But they haven't spoken in years. \nCUT TO: \n18   INT. PAPADOPOULOS MANSION - DINING ROOM. EVENING 4.        18 \nThe family is sitting at the dining room table watching SPIROS eat. No one else is eating and the table is set for one. The dining room is spartan - less furniture/ no pictures. We see some tea crates stuffed with tissue wrapped objects. \nSPIROS It was so strange. Oh, James - more lemon son. \nJAMES passes SPIROS a small plate of quartered lemons. SPIROS sticks his fork into one and squeezes juice over his chicken. \nSPIROS (CONT'D) Oh. This is so good Mrs P. In all the years, I never stopped thinking about you or your food. \nMRS PARRINGTON Still so charming. \nSPIROS So, I'm sitting there watching the telly and suddenly I see Papadopoulos & Sons. On the TV. \nTHEO Daddy over leveraged himself. SPIROS Look at this little Englezo. Hey! I'm your Uncle Spiros re. I'm your uncle, re manga! I'm going to eat him he's so cute. \nTHEO Please don't eat me. \nSPIROS Re gugluthi. He's just like his mother. A little Englishman. \nTHEO That's because my Mummy was English. \nSPIROS Ah! I know re! I know. Ah. So! I'm watching the news and I'm thinking, what's my baby brother gone and done now? And just at that moment. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n18   CONTINUED:                                                18 SPIROS (CONT'D) As I'm thinking that thought, in the same split second, the phone rings. And it's him! I mean, it's gotta be some kind of quantum physics there, no? No? Insane. Insane. (To KATIE) Katie. You're so grown up. I can't believe this. You were like... just a girl. Dumpy and spoilt. Look at you now. \nMRS PARRINGTON She's still a little spoilt. \nKATIE Nanny P! \nJAMES And dumpy. \nTHEO Brilliant! KATIE Is he talking about us? \nJAMES Yeah, I think he is. \nHARRY There's nothing there. \nSPIROS Exactly. It's empty. Useless. We'd get nothing for it. But if we made the Three Brothers great again. Hey! That is our destiny! Okay. It needs work. Sure. But destiny need work. \nHARRY You're still crazy. \n(CONTINUED) \n20   CONTINUED:                                                20 \nSPIROS We have. You. You have a better chance of getting through this if we increase the value of the shop. \nHARRY I'm not opening a fish and chip shop, I'm Papadopoulos & Sons, I'm on supermarket shelves. \nKATIE God. What would I tell my friends? \nJAMES Don't know, maybe the truth? \nKATIE (Mimicking) I don't know, maybe the truth. \nJAMES God. Fuck off. \nKATIE F.. f.. fuck you. \nMRS PARRINGTON Enough! \nSPIROS People! Hear me out. If we get it up and running again, we can sell it as a going concern instead of an empty shop. This deal you're working on could take ages. In the meantime, you're getting cash in and you're saving money because it's got two bedrooms. Eh? The Three Brothers is a goldmine. Used to be. Can be again. \nHARRY When did you become so practical? \nSPIROS I'll get it fixed. I'm a handyman now. \nMRS PARRINGTON I thought you were a waiter Spiros. \nSPIROS Around too much booze Mrs P. I went travelling. Belgium, America, Brooklyn. I ended up managing a block of apartments in LA. I do painting, decorating, plumbing, electrics, everything. \n(CONTINUED) \n20   CONTINUED: (2)                                            20 \nMRS PARRINGTON A man who can fix things. \nSPIROS I've got a van. \nHARRY Oh. It's alright everyone. Don't panic. He's got a van. \nSPIROS Let's go look at the shop. Let me go and start working on it now. \nHARRY You're out of your mind. I know what you're up to. You want to make some money for yourself. That's fine. It's okay. It's okay. At least you're thinking smart these days. But don't involve us in all this. \nSPIROS I want to help. \nMRS PARRINGTON Given the current situation, I think it's worth consideration. \nSPIROS, HARRY, JAMES and THEO walk up a steel staircase onto the Three Brother's roof terrace. \nSPIROS Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey. Remember up here? We used to bring out the tables and chairs with the other Greeks. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \n28   CONTINUED:                                                28 SPIROS (CONT'D) What ever happened to Soula, Pani and Stavro? I loved that crowd. Sometimes there'd be a poker game. Sometimes dancing. We had fun. \nTHEO Did my Daddy dance? \nSPIROS Yeah. I taught him. And your mother. \nTHEO My Mummy? \nSPIROS Hey. Manga. This is the place where your Mummy and Daddy met. \nJAMES What? Up here? \nSPIROS Yeah. They talked all night. They danced. Yeah, there was a lot of dancing here. Hey. You want me to show you? How about it? \nSPIROS clicks his fingers. \nHARRY Spiros please. It's not a holiday. Just show everyone around. \nHARRY exits. \nSPIROS What? (To THEO) I'll show you later. (To JAMES) You alright? \nJAMES Yeah. No, I like the view. I might put some plants up here. \nCUT TO: \n29   EXT. THE THREE BROTHERS. DAY 6.                           29 \nKATIE is outside the shop, having a cigarette. We see Mehmet approach. \nMEHMET Hello. \nKATIE Hi. \nMEHMET Do you have a light? (CONTINUED) \n29   CONTINUED:                                                29 \nKATIE You came all this way for a light? \nKATIE hands him a lighter. \nMEHMET I'm from the kebab shop across the road. \nKATIE Nice. \nSilence. MEHMET's run out things to say. They both smoke. \nMEHMET My Dad wants me to spy on you. I don't think he like Greeks. (More silence) You want to go out sometime? \nKATIE Yeah, alright. \nMEHMET I'm Mehmet. \nHARRY But? \nROB Money isn't cheap Harry. These guys will want at least 95% of the company. \nHARRY Leaving me with nothing. I'd do the same thing. I'd be CEO of Papadopoulos & Sons. Get a salary. Get my house back. My children's future. \nROB It beats fish and chips. \nSOPHIE You'd be working for someone else. \nHARRY I'd be working for someone else. By the way, I'm not actually running a fish and chip shop. Just helping my brother relaunch. ROB Sure. Listen, there maybe another way. Came up in conversation with the Norske Velconan Bank. It'd be along the lines of a straight loan to buy back the business. \nHARRY Why would they lend me the money? \nROB Well. Let's ask them. Want me to look into it? \nHARRY Sure, no choice. \nROB's mobile alarm goes off. \n(CONTINUED) \n32   CONTINUED: (2)                                            32 \nROB Okay. Cool. Got to go. Got an emergency with - get this - a high tech portable toilet company - that has literally gone down the tubes. (ROB holds up a flyer for the company) An internet ready, wireless, crapper with a waterproof keyboard and screen. For the love of God. Because taking a dump needed an overhaul. Still, somebody's got to bury them. Inomine patre, Spiritu, Sanctu... etc, etc. \nSOPHIE Got to love a downturn. \nROB Laters. \nROB exits. SOPHIE starts to pack her files. \nSOPHIE I think what you're currently doing with your brother sounds liberating. \nHARRY I'm liberating myself of my last 25 grand on a disused chip shop. \nSOPHIE But its like a startup. Isn't that the most exciting phase of any venture? Taking a bit of a risk. Developing your products and your services. Learning about your market. Look, some of the largest companies on the planet never make a profit. Like a real profit. It's all accounting tricks and leveraged debt. What I'm trying to say is, does it matter if the business is a small one? As long as it makes a profit and the people who work there are happy? \nHARRY What are you doing working in a place like this? \nSOPHIE This is only temporary. I got divorced recently. Came to London for a fresh start. I'm actually looking into setting up my own business. \nHARRY Well, I'm sorry about that. About the divorce, I mean. Not... \n(CONTINUED) \n32   CONTINUED: (3)                                            32 \nSOPHIE I've been meaning to ask. Can I come and visit your shop sometime? \nHARRY There isn't one. \nSOPHIE When it's up and running. \nHARRY It's a chip shop. It's hot. On your feet all hours. Verbal abuse from customers on a Friday night. \nSOPHIE I wasn't applying for a job Harry. Just wanted to stop by. \nKATIE and JAMES tickle THEO who squeals with delight. SPIROS laughs. \nCUT TO: \n34   INT. THE THREE BROTHERS - LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 8.              34 \nSPIROS opens the door on the sparse living room. HARRY is lying neatly in silk pyjamas, in a sleeping bag on a camp bed. He is staring at the ceiling. \nSPIROS Ah, your kids are something else. \nSPIROS undresses, taking off items of clothes until he is down to his boxer shorts. SPIROS then gets out an icon of the Virgin Mary. He kisses it and then crosses himself three times. \nSPIROS (CONT'D) Don't worry. I'm not too religious. I'm a lapsed Buddhist. I do everything a good Buddhist does except abstinence. \nSPIROS farts. Harry shuts his eyes and shakes his head in disgust. SPIROS then hands HARRY some ear plugs. \nSPIROS (CONT'D) Ear plugs. \nSPIROS gets into the sleeping bag and turns off the light. \nSPIROS (CONT'D) Oi re. This is a fantastic thing. Did you ever imagine, 30 years ago? Back here? HARRY No. \nSPIROS Remember how excited we felt when we got this place? It feels like that again. Hey. My gut says... push Alaskan Pollock. Over Cod! What do you think? \nHARRY I should never have taken out that loan. \nSPIROS Ah. We'll talk fish after we fix this place. (Singing) We'll talk fish after we fix this place. Katie's got some good thoughts. Says we should keep the old look. And she had some beautiful ideas about the uniforms. (CONTINUED) \n34   CONTINUED:                                                34 \nHARRY But then, you know. The potential yield of the Plaza. Papadopoulos Plaza. Fully developed with a thousand year lease. I would have kept the freehold. I'm telling you Spiro. It was good. I'd have been worth a fortune. Worth, I don't know. One billion five. One billion six. One billion six. Big numbers Spiro. Big, big numbers. \nSPIROS starts snoring. HARRY puts the ear plugs in and stares out into the darkness. \nCUT TO: \n35   EXT. THE THREE BROTHERS. DAY 9.                           35 \nWe are in front of the shop. SPIROS addresses a small gathering of people who have turned up to help in the renovation. He holds a bottle of champagne. Alongside him, HARRY carries the box of cleaning products. We see JAMES, KATIE, THEO and MRS PARRINGTON. We see FAT LAKI, PHIL THE TILL, FATHER JIMMY, a Greek Orthodox priest and an assortment of Greek faces of various ages. \nSPIROS We were children when we came to the UK with nothing. We start again. Fat Laki. The weight you lost is an inspiration. Phil The Till. You've helped many Greeks with your tax friendly till machines. Eh, only two things are certain in life - death and taxes. Unless you're Greek. Then it's only death! (The crowd cheer). Nikos, Kyriaco, Androniki, Loula, Uncle Panikos, Aphrodite, Maria and of course, Father Jimmy. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. \nHARRY Didn't Father Jimmy get done for selling illegal copies of Rambo? \nSPIROS He's got three liquor stores in Palmers Green. \nHARRY He always hated me. \nHARRY now addresses the small crowd. \n(CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:                                                35 \nHARRY (CONT'D) People. Hello. Sorry. Hi. I just want you to know this is a temporary situation for the family. I'm currently in negotiations with a top corporate finance team about re- acquiring the assets of Papadopoulos & Sons. That's it. \nUNCLE PANIKOS What did he say? \n37   CONTINUED:                                                37 \nMEHMET That's a lot of Greeks. \nKatie grabs her coat. \nKATIE What? We're going out. \nMRS PARRINGTON Not too late. \nKATIE exits with MEHMET. \nMRS PARRINGTON (CONT'D) Well, she is 18. \nHARRY We'll make a better product at a cheaper price with larger portions. We'll lose money on the kebabs in the short term, put Turks out of business within a year, make our margins on the fish and when the rest of this crummy street has packed up we'll raise our prices and cut our portion sizes. \nSPIROS The entrepreneur has spoken. \nHARRY Hey, it's temporary, but as long as we're here we'll do some business. \nCUT TO: \n38   EXT. THE THREE BROTHERS. EVENING 9.                         38 Establishing shot of the finished gleaming shop at night. We hear the sound of a sizzling frying pan.

Inside the skip among old cardboard boxes, a broken chair etc he finds a selection of plants - some of them in pots. He picks one up, the one with the distinctive Union Jack pot, and brushes the leaves. We then see him walk off with a box of plants. \nCUT TO: \n42   INT. THE THREE BROTHERS - RESTAURANT AREA.

After years of abuse on my behalf and unacceptable behavior, I reached a moment of clarity - actually this was two years ago. (Reading) I'd like to apologise for the hurt I've caused. \nHARRY What now? \nSPIROS (Reading) There were aspects of my behaviour which were unacceptable.

And so, maybe the very first vikings were descended from Ancient Greeks, somewhere in the deep mists of time. And so it's so... so Wagnerian, yah?

What else is there? \nROB Sell off the food but keep the property. \nLARS Papadopoulos Plaza. It's going to be worth a fortune. \nHARRY That's not what I had in mind. \nSOPHIE It's an asset breakup. \nLARS Tusk. Tusk, yah? Makes us sound like barbarians. \nROB With the new loan, you'd buy back your old assets and then sell off the brands in the Pap & Sons stable. \nLARS Yah. And you know how to squeeze the value Harry. \nSOPHIE That's a break up. \nHARRY Please. I know what it is. \nLARS The pitta bread, the cakes get sold to a bakery. \nROB The halloumi and feta to a dairy company. \nLARS I love your halloumi! Grilled. It's... (Kisses air) \nSOPHIE Okay.

The fish, the potatoes, the packaging etc. Would you include energy? Light, heat? \nHARRY Yeah. But not rent because we already own the building. \nSOPHIE Okay. And 30% on labour? \nHARRY Yeah. \nSOPHIE So it's 30/30/30. Classic restaurant model. \nHARRY That's right. \nSOPHIE What are your weaknesses? \nHARRY The price of fish can vary. Dramatically. \nSOPHIE Can you vary the menu? \nHARRY You don't want to complicate it. \nSOPHIE It doesn't have to be complicated Harry. (Beat) What are your fears? \nHARRY My fears? Oh. Just that it just won't work out. That fish and chips has maybe had its day. \nSOPHIE No. Hang on a second. (They stop) Fish and chips is a British classic. It's much more than just a quick meaningless experience. It's something to be savoured. Just think of the soft, white, cod flakes, gently falling away as your fork pierces the hard, crunchy shell of the golden batter. The rich smells of a fryer's delight. The tangy smack of salt and vinegar on your lips. Hell yeah. I'd pay for that.

Once in the fire, and once after the banks. I was always embarrassed by him, you know. By his thing that he does. You know, his... 'thing'. But the thing that he does. It's a good thing really. These last few months. This year actually. This whole year. God. What a year. What a year. And yet. I've never felt so alive. I've never felt so engaged. Why is that? I mean why?

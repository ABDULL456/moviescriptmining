It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise. (beat) Wanna dance? \nKarla passes by -- \nKARLA Say yes. \nJULIE No. \nKARLA No means yes. \nJULIE Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers -- \nTYRELL (heading for the floor) Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me. \nKARLA Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance. \n7A\tINT. THE CLUB - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT \nis packed and thumping. Karla is dancing her way through the crowd. Tyrell and Julie follow behind her. \nKarla sees Will. He's dressed up and nervous. She smiles. \nKARLA (cont'd) Whaddayou know? Will Benson lookin' fine. \nJULIE (suspicious, but having fun) Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here? \nKARLA Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway. \nWILL (shy to a fault) This was not my idea. \nJULIE What? \nWILL I said, this...Do you want a drink? \nWill looks down at his feet. He and Julie stand there not quite knowing what to do. \nTYRELL Where I come from, you want to snatch the goodies, you got to at least talk to them first. \nTyrell and Karla go for it on the dance floor, leaving Will and Julie alone. They look at each other. They look at everyone dancing. \nWILL How about a drink? \nWill is a few steps ahead as they move for the bar. Julie seems to be relaxing, having a good time. Then, she looks up into the balcony and sees, in a strobe light's FLASH -- \nSOMEONE IN A SLICKER \nwatching her intently. She squints for a better look, but he's gone. \nWILL (yelling over the din) You okay? \nShe's chalk white and crestfallen.

He turns down a service corridor. \nJulie follows, frightened, but unable to resist. \nShe catches him at the end of the corridor. She reaches out and grabs the stranger's arm. \nJULIE Ben... \nThe stranger turns around. It's only a club kid in a tacky vinyl raincoat and hat. She's shaken. \nSLICKER GUY Hye, baby.

Julie frowns. \nJulie spins, once again startled by Karla, who crosses to the dryer, flipping open the lid and then jumping back to catch the shoes as they pop out on the fly. \nJULIE (still sleepy) That could break the machine. \nKARLA Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact. \nThe phone RINGS. Karla looks at her watch. \nKARLA (cont'd) It's Tyrell. \nJULIE (resigned) The number's unlisted... \nKARLA Would you relax? We've been dating three months.

How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway? \nKARLA Yes! \nJulie hits the SPEAKERPHONE BUTTON and Karla hangs up. The DJ's voice echos through the appartment. \nMARK (V.O.) Good, then I hope you remember your geography, Karla, because all you have to do to win is tell me the capital of Brazil. \nKarla's smile abruptly fades. \nKARLA (into phone) Brazil?

Roll out the red carpet. Our contest winners are here at last. \nHe scans a sheet as Tyrell stares at the pit bull. \nTYRELL Nice dog. \nBROOKS Not really.

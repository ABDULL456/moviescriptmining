{"train": "The bartender sets down drinks on Karla's tray. \nKARLA (re: Julie) Ask her to dance. \nTyrell hesitates. \nKARLA (cont'd) Go on. \nKarla cuts away through the crowd, delivering drinks. Tyrell turns to Julie. \nTYRELL You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules. \nJULIE Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature. \nTYRELL That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise. (beat) Wanna dance? \nKarla passes by -- \nKARLA Say yes. \nJULIE No. \nKARLA No means yes. \nJULIE Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers -- \nTYRELL (heading for the floor) Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me. \nKARLA Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance. \n7A\tINT. THE CLUB - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT \nis packed and thumping. Karla is dancing her way through the crowd. Tyrell and Julie follow behind her. \nKarla sees Will. He's dressed up and nervous. She smiles. \nKARLA (cont'd) Whaddayou know? Will Benson lookin' fine. \nJULIE (suspicious, but having fun) Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here? \nKARLA Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway. \nWILL (shy to a fault) This was not my idea. \nJULIE What? \nWILL I said, this...Do you want a drink? \nWill looks down at his feet. He and Julie stand there not quite knowing what to do. \nTYRELL Where I come from, you want to snatch the goodies, you got to at least talk to them first. \nTyrell and Karla go for it on the dance floor, leaving Will and Julie alone. They look at each other. They look at everyone dancing. \nWILL How about a drink? \nWill is a few steps ahead as they move for the bar. Julie seems to be relaxing, having a good time. Then, she looks up into the balcony and sees, in a strobe light's FLASH -- \nSOMEONE IN A SLICKER \nwatching her intently. She squints for a better look, but he's gone. \nWILL (yelling over the din) You okay? \nShe's chalk white and crestfallen. Her whole affect is \"Will I ever have a normal time?\" She drifts amay toward the stairs to the balcony. \nWILL (cont'd) Hey Julie? \nWill catches Karla and Tyrell's eyes. They're worried. \n7B\tINT. THE CLUB - STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nJulie catches another glimps of THE SLICKER. \nShe pushes her way through the crowd up the stairs. \n7C\tINT. THE CLUB - BALCONY - NIGHT \nJulie looks all around -- finally spotting the MAN IN THE SLICKER from behind, making his way to the other side. \nHe slices through a crowd of students, and Julie keeps following. He turns down a service corridor. \nJulie follows, frightened, but unable to resist. \nShe catches him at the end of the corridor. She reaches out and grabs the stranger's arm. \nJULIE Ben... \nThe stranger turns around. It's only a club kid in a tacky vinyl raincoat and hat. She's shaken. \nSLICKER GUY Hye, baby. You following me up here? (a come-on) Well, all right. \nJulie turns away and hurries down the hallway. Todd follows, but his figure quickly fades. \nKARLA AND JULIE Magic 96.7! \nJulie hangs up and joins Karla dancing on the couch. \nKARLA I won. I won...I won, I won, I won. (teasing) Now, let's see...There's Tyrell, that's one. And, there's my parents ...And I got some cousins. (beat) Okay, Julie, you can come, but Mark said four tickets. That means you gotta get yourself a date. \nJulie thinks, she seems torn. \nCUT TO: \n9\tEXT. SOUTHPORT DOCKS - DAY \nA SMALL MOUND OF RED SNAPPER is DUMPED -- wiggling and suffocating its way across the deck of a fishing boat. \nWE PULL AWAY TO REVEAL it's RAY who's just done the dumping. A coworker, DAVE, friendly, playful, and down-to-earth, calls out from the dock -- \nDAVE Hey, Ray...phone! \nRay takes the phone. \nWE INTERCUT. \nJULIE Hi. \nRay is happy to hear her voice, but cautious. \nRAY (beat) Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry. \nJULIE (compassoinate) No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one -- \nRAY No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just... \nJULIE It's okay. \nDave holds up two wriggling snappers. He dances them toward each other in a puppetlike mating ritual, making KISSING SOUNDS and narrating -- \nDAVE (as the fish) Julie, I love you. I know I'm only a humble fish, but if you really look at it, you're a fish, too. (girl voice) Oh, Ray, you're right...Do me like a snapper. (mashing the fish together) Hey, something smells like fish... \nRay waves him away, concentrating on his call. \nJULIE Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her. \nRAY What? The Bahamas? You're kidding. \nDave's interest is piqued. \nJULIE We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and... (sexy) You know... \nRAY This weekend? \nDave is watching Ray closely. Ray's expression hardens. \nRAY (hurt) You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me? \nDAVE Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. \nKarla is watching Julie. \nJULIE It's not you, it's Southport. And it's the Bahamas! And it's free! \nKarla is watching Julie. \nKARLA You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas? \nJULIE Ray, come on. I want us to be together. \nRay thinks. Dave looks at him like he's crazy. \nRAY (can't give in) Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it. \nJULIE Will you try...for me, please? \nDave moves one of the fish like it's been shot through the heart. \nRAY Okay, I'll try. But, listen... (martyrlike) If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time. \nJULIE Ray...please try. I really miss you. (beat) Okay. Bye. \nShe hangs up and Karla sits next to her. \nKARLA That boy has got fish on the brain. (sensitive) Hey, cheer up, Charlie. (singing a rumba) We're going to the Bahamas. Bahama Mama, yeah... \n10\tEXT. SOUTHPORT DOCKS - DAY \nRay is staring unhappily at the little pile of snapper. Dave is staring at him in disbelief. \nDAVE Man, what is your problem? We haven't caught anything for days. Pull the big ugly stick out of your butt. She asked you to go to the Bahamas! Man, you gotta go. We'll both drive up. I got friends I can see up there. \nRay realizes how right he is. \nRAY Stupid. Stupid. \nDAVE Stupid. What were you thinkng? \nRay reaches toward the body... \n12D\tINT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT \nSomething FLASHES IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRROR. \n12E\tEXT. ROAD - NIGHT \nRay turns over the body. Something isn't right. Ray jumps back -- \nCLOSE - SLICKER MANNEQUIN \nIts eerie smile mocking Ray who turns for the truck. \nRAY DAVE! \n12F\tEXT. TRUCK - NIGHT \nDave hears something. He turns to late. SPLLAATTT!!! THE FISHERMAN jams his hook through Dave's jaw and skull and YANKS DAVE OUT OF THE CAR WINDOW. \nRAY ...Dave? \nThere's no answer from dead Dave. Ray tries to see around the headlights. He moves slowly toward the truck. \nThe BRIGHTS and FOGS come on, blinding Ray. The truck's engine REVS. The truck rolls a few inches, adjusting a bead on Ray. \nThen, tires spinning, the truck launches straight at Ray. \nRay runs at the truck. AT THE LAST MINUTE, he ducks behind the parked car. \nHIS TRUCK goes SCREAMING past. \nRay backs around the car -- \nAN EIGHTEEN-WHEELER \ngoes barreling by in the other direction. Ray dives out of the way. \nIN THE ROAD \nRay is exposed. He sees his truck closing fast. He's got nowhere to go. Then, at the very last second, \nRAY \njumps off the edge of the road. His TRUCK SLAMS INTO THE BARRIER RIGHT WHERE RAY WAS STANDING. SPARKS FLY! METAL BUCKLES! \nRay falls through the air. Lands hard on his leg. Tumbles down the hill, finally stopping with a crash. He lies motionless at the bottom of a ravine. \nFADE OUT: \n13\tEXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nKarla exits the building. She watches Julie sitting on the curb. \nA truck turns onto the street. Julie looks hopeful, but -- it's not Ray. \nKarla approaches her friend. \nKARLA Girl, it's gettin' down to the wire. \nJulie turns. \nJULIE He's not coming. I thought he was just... \nKARLA Julie, you left four messages... Four. \nJULIE But, he said he'd try. \nKARLA He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing! \nJULIE (appoligizing for him) He does work hard. \nKARLA Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can. (hesitant) And I don't want to have to say I told you so... \nJULIE Then, don't. \nA Jeep Cherokee stops, and an ebullient Tyrell steps out wearing shorts and a Hawaiian shirt. \nTYRELL Hey, baby, we gonna get tropical or we gonna get tropical? \nThe passenger door opens and Will Benson steps hesitantly around the Jeep. \nJULIE Oh! \nKARLA (re: Will) Hey, sorry... (quick, playing it off) He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste. \nWill reads Julie's expression. \nWILL Julie, is everything cool? Karla said... \nKARLA I said we start having fun. And that means now. \nJulie takes a last look up the street. She stands. \nPAULSEN Few more minutes. \nWe move off the boat and REVEAL the island. The intrepid vacationers excitedly take in the island. \nCUT TO: \n18\tEXT. TOWER BAY - DAY \nEstablishing. An isolated tropical paradise with jungle growing to the beach. \n19\tEXT. RESORT DOCK - DAY \nThe ferry pulls in to a canopied dock. A white-sand beach stretches in every direction. Beautiful tourists stroll about without a care in the world. \nTyrell stamps his feet on the dock. \nTYRELL I feel like I'm still on that thing. \nA dockhand, DERRICK, glides past him toward the ladies. \nDERRICK That way for a complimentary Planter's Punch to get you readjusted. \nTYRELL (mile-wide smile) I can get used to this. \nDerrick reaches for Julie's hand, clearly checking her out in the process. \nDERRICK Welcome, Fair Princess, to Tower Bay. (a wink) I'm Derrick. At your service for the duration of your stay. \nJulie smiles politely. Will gently nudges her on. They walk away. \nPAULSEN (to Derrick, mocking) I'm at your service, Princess. \nDERRICK (shrugs) Season's over old man. So I gotta work fast. \nPAULSEN If Marine Radio's right about the weather, you're already out of time. \nHe hangs a SIGN at the end of the gangplank. It reads: LAST DEPARTING FERRY -- LINE FORMS HERE. \nOur guys are already at the end of the dock. \nCUT TO: \n20\tEXT. TOWER BAY HOTEL - DAY \nEstablishing. An opulent, Carribean-style hacienda resort with all the accoutrements. \nThe main building is two stories high with a tiled roof. A bell tower rises from one side. And, of course, it is surounded on all sides by suffocating fooliage. \nJulie and Karla take in the beauty of the resort. \nKARLA Check it out. \nTOW BIKINI GIRLS \ncatch the eyes of Tyrell and Will. \nTYRELL Yes, ma'am. \nKarla THWACKS him on the back of the head, but they're all having fun. \nThe path widens. The trees part. It's even nicer up close. They walk across a tiled plaza. \nBehind them, THREE YOUNG GUYS carry their GIRLFRIENDS piggyback, racing each other toward the departure dock. \nOur two arriving couples move on toward the entrace, passing a FENCED TENNIS COURT on the left. A GLASS-PANED ORCHID HOUSE straight ahead. And, on the right, \nA LUSH POOL with a built-in JACUZZI in the shallow end. An outdoor THATCHED ROOF BAR stands nearby -- and just beyonk it, a small POOL HOUSE. \nA guy's unintelligible RASTA VOICE calls out -- \nRASTA VOICE Anybudorsomethin'? \nThey turn to see TITUS, white guy, dreads, full-Rasta demeanor. He's a phony, but sincere about it. \nTitus approaches Tyrell -- \nTITUS My brother, can I interest you in the islands finest ganja? \nWILL (teasing) Hey, Tyrell, we found you brother. \nTYRELL (wry) Not possible. \nTITUS (undetered) Who be wantin' the kind, the uber- sticky, the Bwana, The depth-charge, the Up-All-Night-Laughing-With-Your- Friends? Who wants it? 'Cause Titus got it. \nWILL No, thanks. \nTITUS Come on, man. Everybody wants something. \nWill and Tyrell walk on. Undetered, Titus goes up to Karla and Julie. \nTITUS (cont'd) How 'bout you, ladies? Lovely ladies. \nTitus moves his hips. \nBROOKS You're in 201 and 202. \nKARLA (expecting this) Is that bad? \nBROOKS (lying) Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites. \nTyrell wraps his arms around Karla. Julie looks uncomfortably towards Will. \nJULIE Your what? \nBROOKS Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet? \nJULIE We haven't exchanged anything. \nKARLA Julie, we're talkin' suites! (excited) That'll be just fine with us. \nBROOKS And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need. \nKARLA Wait...Did you say off-season? \nBROOKS July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork. \nJULIE Storm season? \nBROOKS It's our version of winter. (hands over the keys) 201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy. \nAnd Brooks turns away through the office door. They walk toward their rooms. Will catches up with them. \nCUT TO: \n24\tINT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY \nThey walk down the hallway. Karla seems annoyed. \nKARLA Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true. (dissapointed) I wanted you all to have a good trip. \nTYRELL We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves. \nWILL And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend. \nJULIE It beets being on the mainland. \nKARLA Oooh, the mainland -- \nTYRELL Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical! \nThe mood is improving. A SQUEEKING NOISE interupts. \nA BRASS LUGGAGE CART has appeared behind them. And ESTES, 60s, the weary Haitian porter, steps from behind it. \nESTES (a Carribean accent) 201 and 202...Who put you in...? (hesitant) Don't use these much -- \nJULIE (suspicious) Why's that? \nHe sees their happy, expectant faces and changes the subject. \nESTES No real reason. (then) Pretty fancy rooms for kids your age. \nKARLA We won a competition. \nESTES Oh, yeah? What you have to do? \nTYRELL Guess the capital of Brazil -- \nKARLA Rio, baby! \nESTES Ahh, good for you, girl. (waiting for a cue) ...And, where would you like me to put the bags? \nA beat as Julie and Karla exchange a look. Then, Karla tosses one of the keys to Julie. \nKARLA (to Estes) Their stuff in there... (grabbing Tyrell) ...and ours in here. \nJULIE Karla! You promised. \nKARLA (looking at Tyrell) I also promised Tyrell. \nTYRELL Promised me what, baby? (joking around) I made all my promises to William. \nTyrell makes fake goo-goo eyes at Will. Estes looks away. \nTYRELL (cont'd) Sweetie, you brought your nightie, didn't you? \nWILL Forward! A girl needs time to make up his mind. (to Julie, thoughtful) Julie, look, if it's cool, I'll sleep on the couch and they can have their own room to practice for that real honeymoon. \nBut Tyrell grabs Karla and drags her into the room. We here GIGGLES. \nWILL I'll take those. \nESTES No, I've been doing this since before you were a dream in your father's eye. \nEstes grabs the bags and takes them into the room. Julie and Will are left staring at each other. \nWILL You sure it's okay with you? \nShe grabs a TOWEL off the bathroom door, trying to help him clean up the mess. \nJULIE No, no, no. This was really sweet... \nWILL I scared you -- I crossed the line -- \nJULIE No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry. \nWILL Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand. (covering the awkwardness) I'm going to take a walk and dry off. \nJULIE Are you sure? I really appreciate it. \nHe picks up a rose. Most of its petals on the floor. \nWILL I just really like you and I want you to feel good about everything...You know? I want you to be happy. \nHe hands the rose to her. There's a moment between them. He reluctantly heads for the door. \nCUT TO: \n28A\tEXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT \nWill looks down at his wet pants. \nWILL (soto) Dork. \nPassing Karla and Tyrell's room on his way down the hall, Will spots the DO NOT DISTURB SIGN. \nHe hears an INCREDIBLE POUNDING from inside. He shakes his head and mopes down the hall. \nCUT TO: \n29\tINT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nKarla bounces playfully on their big bed as Tyrell crosses toward the windows. \nKARLA Tha's it. (bounce) I've decided. (bounce) I'm changing my major to finance. (bounce) And going to Wall Street. \nTYRELL Why? \nKARLA 'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this. \nShe falls back against the plush comforter, looking up at herself in a long MIRROR HANGING RIGHT OVER THE BED. Tyrell loves this and quickly moves beside her in the bed. She lets him get real close, then she jumps up -- \nKARLA (cont'd) Jacuzzi. \nTyrell reaches for her, but she bounces off the bed. \nTYRELL Ah, baby, let's stay right here. \nKarla pulls her suit out of a bag and models it seductively and flirtatiously for Tyrell. \nKARLA I spent a hundred bucks on it...even if it's just so you can pull it off. \nTyrell gets off the bed -- \nTYRELL I like the sound of this. \nCUT TO: \n30\tEXT. HOTEL DOCKS - NIGHT \nDerrick, the dockhand, whistles in the darkness as he coils the bow rope of a service boat around a cleat on the dock. \nOminous shadows play all along the dock. Out on the water there's a big SPLASH. \nThe dockhand rises, looking out at the water with a sigh. \nDERRICK Damn. I should've brought my pole. \nHe turns away. As he does, we see \nTHE END OF THE DOCK \nwhere a sinister SLICKER FIGURE stands perfectly still, silhouetted by moonlight. \nDerrick paces down the dock the other way past a handfull of other tied-off staff and service boats. \nHe picks up a hose and begins spraying down the hull of a Sunfish sailboat. \nHe turns the hose off and begins coiling it, backing toward an EQUIPMENT SHACK. Suddenly, a HAND touches him on the back. He jumps and turns to see -- \nTITUS \nstanding there smoking a spliff. \nDERRICK Get lost, you scared me. \nTITUS Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out. \nDERRICK Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain. \nTITUS That's why you'll come with Titus, mon. \nWILL Ahh, that feels great. \nKARLA (considerate) How's Julie? \nWILL Alone. In the room. (to Karla) Got any advise? \nTYRELL (annoyed) Yeah. Find another Jacuzzi. \nKarla shoots Tyrell a look. \nKARLA (to Will) Your not out yet, slugger. You gotta just get back up there and keep swingin'. \nCUT TO: \n31A\tEXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nRay is at a telephone booth up the street from Julie's apartment. \nHe looks exausted. Blood seeps through his shirt. He's in pain. \nRAY I need an international operator. \nCUT TO: \n31B\tINT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT \nIn the empty night lobby, behind the desk \nTHE TELEPHONE \nRINGS and RINGS. We push in on the phone RINGING unanswered in the night. Nobody is around to answer it. \nCUT TO: \n32\tINT. HOTEL - JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThe DOOR CREAKS OPEN once again to her room. And from a STRANGER'S POV -- WE SLOWLY CREEP INSIDE. \nA CLOUD OF STEAM billows from the open BATHROOM. THE SOUND OF A SHOWER is heard. We MOVE TOWARD IT. \nINT. SHOWER \nEyes closed, Julie stands with her face right under the showerhead, trying to relax. Something softly goes THUMP. \nJulie opens her eyes. Turns off the shower. Stands there, frozen, listening. \nJULIE (calling out) Will...? \nNo reply. \nAT THE BATHROOM DOORWAY \nIn a robe with a towel on her head, Julie peeks into her room. Nobody there. She sighs, and crosses back to the bathroom sink. \nAT THE SINK \nJulie looks to a spot where her toothbrush should be. She frowns. Looks around. Some of her things are missing. She peers into the fogged-up bathroom mirror. \nShe whips the TOWEL off her head and WIPES IT ACROSS THE MIRROR, MAKING THE BEDROOM BEHIND HER VISIBLE. \nReady to spit, she looks down. AND IN THAT INSTANT -- WE SEE A SHADOWY FIGURE PASS BEHIND HER IN THE BEDROOM. She looks back up...and HE'S GONE. Julie turns on the water to rinse. \nANGLE ON THE BEDROOM DOOR \nas it SLOWLY CREAKS SHUT, the SOUND DROWNED OUT by the SINK. \nINT. BATHROOM \nJulie turns off the water -- and KLUNK-KLUNK -- and NOISE at her door. The sound STOPS. \nINT. JULIE'S BEDROOM \nShe steps out of the bathroom, crossing toward the door. \nJULIE Will? \nNo answer. She peers through the PEEPHOLE. \nJULIE (cont'd) Is that you? \nShe unlocks and opens it. Nobody there. \nJulie quickly closes the door and relocks it, her heart rate just begining to rise again as... \nKLUNK-KLUNK. She hears it again. Then, the sound STOPS. But standing at the door -- she realizes that's not where it came from. Her eyes immediately go to... \nTHE CLOSET \nDamn. That's where it came from. She slowy pads across the room in her slippers toward the door. Trembling...she reaches for the handle...AND TUGS IT OPEN! \nThere's NOTHING. She stares a beat. DRIP DRIP DRIP. \nShe sees something on the floor of the closet. She touches a finger to it. \nShe picks up the phone, listens, then dangles it from her hand. \nJULIE It's dead. \nAn exasperated Brooks heads for the door. \nBROOKS Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it. \nKARLA What about a radio? \nBROOKS Sorry. Emergencies only. \nKARLA What the hell would you call this? \nBROOKS I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts. (beat) All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter. \nAnd Brooks is gone. Outside the window, it starts to rain. There's a CLAP of thunder. \nJULIE \nlooks out the window with glazed-over eyes. \n35\tEXT. HOTEL - NIGHT \nAnd we PULL AWAY from Julie's face through the glass -- SLOWLY TILTING above her room to another \nTINY WINDOW \nin the bell tower. A candle burns, and lighning flashes illuminate the haggard face of Estes, the porter. \nCUT TO: \n36\tINT. HOTEL TOWER ROOM - NIGHT \nIt's a claustrophobic room. Estes turns away from the window, shirtless in his uniform pants. A beaded cord hangs around his neck, small fishhook dangling from it. \nBeside the candle, he picks up a leather bag and dumps out a handful of voodoo icons: roots, coins, sea glass, chicken's foot. He sets them on a divination tray. \nHe opens vials and sprinkles powder and assorted liquids into a small wooden bowl. He opens a drawer and extracts a toothbrush. He dips the brush in the bowl -- covering its bristles with a sticky goo. He holds the brush over the candle's flame. The old man watches it SIZZLE. \nESTES picks up \nA STRAW FIGURE \nand impales it on his fishhook necklace. \nHis eyes roll back in his head. He enters a trance. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n37\tINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nOlga, the maid, pushes her laundry cart toward the end of a long, dimly lit hall. She sees a pile of dirty linens outside of a room -- ROOM 228. \nShe stops, perplexed. There's nobody staying in this room. She picks them up and stuff them in her cart. Then she knocks on the door. \nOLGA Housekeeping. (beat) Housekeeping. \nShe knocks again and notices her hand leaving bloody marks on the door. She looks at her other hand. Her arms and hands are covered in blood. \nShe turns back to the linens. Something bloody is wrapped inside of them. She paws at the sheets, trying to unravel the mystery -- \nThe door the Room 228 slowly cracks open. A STEEL HOOK reaches out and slices into her apron. It tugs. She turns, and she starts to SCREAM, she is yanked into the room. \nA DO NOT DISTURB sign flips over the handle and the door SLAMS shut. \nWe hear her SCREAMS from inside. \nCUT TO: \n38\tEXT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT \nEstablishing. Bars on the windows. Neon PAWN fickering. Hand-painted sign reads: Se Habla Ingles. \n39\tINT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON AN ENGAGEMENT RING \nRay's engagement ring. The pawn shop owner, MAC, cowboy hat, knows his job, holds it up to the viewing loop next to his eye. \nMAC Jeez, that's a full carat -- \nRAY How much? \nMAC Well, there's some flaws in her... \nRAY How much? \nMac looks around his shop at the usual jumble of crap: vacuum cleaners, golf clubs, guitar amps... \nMAC Don't really have the market for something like this... (like it hurts him) I can go two...two-fifty. \nRAY Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too. \n42\tINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY \nWill and Tyrell step out of the room into the long, empty corridor. They cross to a balcony overlooking the lobby. The whole place seems deserted. \nTYRELL Where is everybody? \nWILL (gallows humor) They're all dead...Dead, I tell you. (ghostly) Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss. \nWill's voice echoes across the lobby. Tyrell is maybe a little nervous, but hiding it. \nTYRELL Shut up. \nThey walk down the steps to the lobby. \n43\tINT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY \nThey cross the lobby. \nWILL (calling out) Hello? (worried) There's nobody here, Tyrell. \nTyrell's already out the front entrance. \n44\tEXT. HOTEL - DAY \nWill and Tyrell exit the hotel and make their way down the steps outside and go splashing across the flooded grounds. Debris from the storm is scattered all around them. \nTYRELL They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners. (beat) Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something. \nWILL (nervous) You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression -- \nTYRELL Hey -- shut up, okay? \nTyrell keeps walking. Will looks around at the wind-and-water-swept vista. Not much of a day for activities. \nWILL (sotto) I don't like to fish. \nTyrell moves across the grounds. He looks back. Will is stopped in his tracks, looking up at -- \nIN THE WINDOW OF THE BELL TOWER -- \nESTES, staring down at them. \nTYRELL (calling to Will) You coming? \nWill trots after him, but he takes a glance back at the window...Estes is gone. \nCUT TO: \n45\tINT. HOTEL FITNESS ROOM - DAY \nJulie has finished on the stairmaster. Both she and Karla are sweaty after a good workout. Their moods have improved. \nKARLA Come on, Vampira. I got just the thing for you. \nKarla leads Julie over to the tanning beds. \nJULIE Cancer in a box. \nKARLA No, this is the safe sun. (joking) It's better than a day at the beach. \nJulie is reluctant. \nKARLA (cont'd) Come on, a little photosynthesis and you'll feel like a new -- \nJULIE Houseplant. \nKarla opens the canopy of the tanning bed. \nKARLA Exactly. \nJulie peels off her sweats. Lies down in her underwear. Straps on a small pair of GOGGLES. \nKarla lowers the canopy over Julie. \nANGLE ON A WALL TIMER \nKarla sets the DIAL. \nKARLA (cont'd) Set to three seventy-five, bake for one hour... \nJULIE Karla! \nKARLA Just kidding. \nULTRA-VIOLET TUBES \ncome to life -- Julie is bathed in purple light. \nCUT TO: \n46\tEXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY \nTyrell looks across the grounds and sees, at the far end of the tennis court, \nShe runs across the room, shoving a folding table toward a row of BASEMENT WINDOWS. \nThe door is hit again and again. Somebody is throwing their shoulder against it. \nKarla bangs hysterically on the windows, leaving bloody handprints on the panes. \nCUT TO: \n50\tINT. TANNING ROOM - DAY \nJulie's eyes suddenly open through the GOGGLES. She thumbs off her WALKMAN. \nJULIE You say something? \nNothing. And just as Julie lies down again, Karla's frantic SCREAMS echo down the hall. \nJulie goes to push open the canopy. As she does, the CANOPY LID is JAMMED DOWN ON TOP OF HER. A CHAIN shoots through the handles. Julie is locked on the grill. \nJULIE (cont'd) Karla! Somebody? Hey, this isn't funny. \nSuddenly the lights go off. Julie thrashes around, trying to free herself. \nJULIE'S POV - THROUGH THE PURPLE LIGHT \nShe sees someone walking around in the room. The person steps closer. Julie could almost reach out and touch him. \nShe begins to SCREAM! \n51\tEXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY \nTyrell angrily makes his way past the outdoor pool bar as Will follows. Tyrell spots a tray of empty bottles. He picks one up and smashes it in half on the ground. He holds out the jagged bottle to Will. \nTYRELL Take this. \nWILL And do what with it? \nTyrell breaks another bottle in half. \nTYRELL Julienne of pool boy. \nThey move toward the nearby POOL HOUSE. \n52\tEXT. POOL HOUSE - DAY \nTyrell and Will stop outside the door. There's MUSIC from inside. More Bob Marley -- \"Lively Up Yourself...\" \nTYRELL (cont'd) I'm gonna throw the door. Get ready. \nTyrell opens the door and charges in. Will's right behind him. \n53\tINT. HOTEL POOL HOUSE - DAY \nThey spill into the room. A light fog hangs in the air. The two of them begin to COUGH and CHOKE. \nTitus sits on the floor facing away from them, facing a window through which gray light pierces the gloom. \nTitus doesn't move. He's too still. In front of him is a large BONG that still SMOKES SLIGHTLY. \nTYRELL Hey, pool boy. \nTyrell closes the distance and kicks Titus in the back. \nTitus falls over like a block of wood, rictus already setting in. \nHis hands are bound behind him. The cord is tied off to some pipes against the wall. \nHIS FINGERNAILS SCRATHCED GROOVES \ninto the floor, scrabbling for the window and fresh air. \nWill points out two empty one-gallon PLASTIC BOTTLES. \nANGLE ON THE BOTTLES \nOne is labeled CHLORINE, the other MURIATIC ACID. \nWill pulls Tyrell from the pool house. \n54\tEXT. HOTEL POOL HOUSE - DAY \nThe two of them collapse, COUGHING and CHOKING. \nTYRELL What the -- ? \nWill splashes a puddle of rainwater on his face -- \nWILL That's chlorine and muriatic acid. Put the two together and you get cyanide. \nTyrell rolls over on his back next to Will, practically coughing up a lung. \nTYRELL Cyanide? Like poison gas? (reality dawning) You mean, somebody really killed him...Omigod. Think...Think... \nSuddenly, they both hear KARLA SCREAMING. They sprint for the main building. \nTyrell picks up the end of a cut mooring line -- \nTYRELL They were cut loose. \nWILL Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here? \nThey look at Julie. Their escape is cut off by water. They're scared. \nJULIE (freaking out) We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one. \nTYRELL Who? \nJULIE Ben Willis. \nKARLA (not this again) Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here. \nJULIE They never found the body. \nHer voice is low and urgent, an impromptu confessional. \nJULIE (cont'd) Two summers ago. We lied to the authorities. We hit Ben Willis with our car. Ray, me, Barry, and Helen ...We threw the body in the water to cover it up -- \nKARLA Julie... \nJULIE Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth. \nTyrell begins backing away from Julie. He picks up a piece of driftwood from the dock. \nJULIE (cont'd) I thought Ray and I killed him on the boat, but we didn't and now he's back to finish up the job. \nTyrell holds up the log as a weapon. He's angry and afraid -- \nTYRELL We're on an island, miles from anywhere. I don't give a crap about you're fisherman. There's dead bodies pilling up everywhere and there's one guy missing -- \nWill moves closer to Tyrell -- \nWILL The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos -- \nTYRELL Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first. \nTyrell turns and heads down the dock. Will goes with him. Karla takes a few hesitant steps after them, then turns back toward Julie, who hasn't moved. \nKARLA Julie, we have to do something. \nJulie sees her friend caught in the middle, sees her suffering. She reluctantly starts for Karla -- \nJULIE (sotto) It's not him. \nCUT TO: \n62\tINT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT \nStandard bus folks: old people in Panama hats, buzz-cut military geeks on holiday. \nRay sits in a seat. He's in pain and does not look good. \nHe pops a handful of pills into his mouth and washes them down with an Orange Crush -- \nA dignified OLD LADY has been watching him -- \nOLD LADY People live healthy in Miami. (sincere, but unsettling) It's the future down there every day of the week...The future. \nRay slumps back, waiting for the pills to work. \nRAY I'll keep that in mind. \nCUT TO: \n63\tINT. HOTEL TOWER ROOM - DUSK \nThe door to Estes's room BANGS inward. Tyrell, Will, Karla, and Julie charge into the room. \nTYRELL Yo, Freak Boy -- \nThe cluttered room is empty. \nWILL He's not here. \nTyrell and Will begin roughly searching through Estes's possessions. \nTYRELL We're gonna find some weird crap in here. \nIn the corner there is a curtain used as a partition. Julie pulls the curtain back and discovers \nA SMALL, HEAVY CABINET \nsitting in the corner. It seems to glow from inside while casting an evil pall over the room. \nJulie moves toward it and hesitates before opening the doors. \nInside -- is a small voodoo shrine. A candle has burned low before it. Hanging before the altar is \nTHE LITTLE STRAW MAN \nJULIE I don't know. \nTYRELL (losing it) You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this -- \nEstes steps forward -- \nJULIE (to Tyrell) How do we know you're not? \nESTES (to Julie) I know who you're talking about. He used to work here at the hotel. (beat) And I've seen him around again. Out in the woods by the orchard. \nThey look at Estes...Is he telling the truth? \nESTES I can't remeber his name, but I don't forget a face. (beseeching) I can show you... \nThey stare a beat -- \nWILL How do we know you're not setting us up? \nESTES Where else you gonna go, son? \nThey look to the office, the gym...The sense of death surrounding them. \nKARLA I know I don't want to stay in here. \nJULIE We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good. \nTYRELL Show us. \nThey begin moving for the door. \nCUT TO: \n66\tEXT. FERRY DOCKS - NIGHT \nEstablish. The rain pounds a fleet of fishing boats. The boats are securely battened down in the weather. \nRay limps past, heading for a small building at the end of the dock. Its sign reads: Island Ferry, Jack Paulsen -- proprieter. \nCUT TO: \n67\tINT. PAULSEN'S BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT \nA gear-strewn office. Paulsen watches an episode of Party of Five. There is a loud KNOCKING at the door. \nPAULSEN What the... \nPaulsen slowly gets up. He cracks the door open. Ray stands silhouetted against the rain. \nRAY I need to get to Tower Bay Island. \nPaulsen senses something isn't right. \nPAULSEN We're closed. \nRay pushes his way in -- \nRAY I need to get there, now. \nPaulsen looks at him standing there drenched. \nPAULSEN Did you happen to notice what's going on outside? \nRay pulls out the gun and points it at Paulsen -- \nRAY I'm not looking for a weather report, I'm looking for a boat. So which one's yours? \nCUT TO: \n68\tEXT. WOODS TRAIL - NIGHT \nEstes, Will, Tyrell, Julie, and Karla walk along a trail through the heart of the island. The storm has abated for a few minutes. \nIt's windy, dark, and spooky. The kind of place you'd take people if you wanted to scare them with a classic ghost story. That is just what Estes is doing. \nESTES He worked here for many years. He had a nice family. A pretty wife and two little ones. A boy and a girl. They'd be about your age, now. \nThey continue along the path. \nEstes looks at them in the dark, slowing for just a second. \nESTES (cont'd) One day his wife went missing. Maid found blood all over the honeymoon suite -- Room 201. \nThere are strange NOISES out in the woods. \nESTES (cont'd) Eventually, they found her body. Pieces. A leg in the swamp. An arm washed up on Three Mile Beach. (beat) And the head they found much later. \nA huge branch is blown from a tree and comes crashing down through the underbrush, scaring them. Estes calmly steps around it. \nESTES (cont'd) Careful -- \nJULIE (softly) Did he do it? \nESTES People say she was running around on him. People say he caught her in bed with other men. People say a lot of things. (beat) He disappeared, taking the two small ones with him. At least they were never found. \nKARLA (hurt) I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood. \nJULIE (sad) Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else. \nKARLA It's too late for that. \nJulie steps over to Karla. \nJULIE I'm so sorry. I brought this on everyone. It's my fault. \nTyrell picks up on the mood swing. He moves closer to them. He's sympathetic. \nTYRELL Forget that. You didn't do nothing. This fisherman's a piece of scum. (hard for him to admit) I should've been listening to you... I'm sorry. \nJulie smiles for a second. \nTYRELL (cont'd) Now, let's take a look at the pantry. \nKARLA You think that's a good place to hide? \nTYRELL I don't know, but I'm starving. \nCUT TO: \n70\tEXT. BEACH - NIGHT \nWill runs from the trees and finds himself by an old house. He sees Estes by the ocean, near a boat. \nWILL Hey Estes. (beat) Estes? Where'd you go? \nEstes doesn't answer right away -- he keeps his back to Will. \nWILL (cont'd) You abandoning us? How come you didn't tell us you had a boat? \nEstes picks up the boat's oar. He speaks low, almost inaudibly. \nESTES This has to end. Now. \nWILL What -- ? \nEstes swings the oar, cracking Will's head hard. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n71\tINT. HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT \nTyrell, Julie, and Karla approach the pantry -- a huge steel door. \n72\tINT. HOTEL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nTyrell steps inside. \nTYRELL Steel door...Food...Perfect. \nHe starts looking for something to eat -- \nCLANK. There's a soft CLATTERING from somewhere in the room. Everyone freezes, staring into the darkness. \nTyrell puts a finger to his lips, then creeps down an aisle, listening. There's nothing but SILENCE. \nHe moves toward the first aisle...He jumps out. The aisle is empty. \nJULIE AND KARLA \nmove down an aisle behind him. \nTyrell ducks around to the second aisle. He slices the air, ready to pounce. This aisle is empty. \nJULIE AND KARLA \nnervously move another aisle down. \nTyrell moves stealthily toward the third aisle...This is it. He lunges forward into the row...Empty, also. \nThere's a small SOUND...A MOUSE scampers off under the shelves. Tyrell turns and smiles at Karla and Julie -- \nTYRELL It's just a -- \nA ROLLING PIN \nbashes him on the back of the head. Tyrell hits the floor, unconscious. \nJULIE AND KARLA SCREAM \nKARLA Ty! \nA DARK FIGURE jumps down from the shelves. Tyrell puts his arms up -- \nTYRELL (yelling for mercy) Don't kill me -- \nJULIE Wait, it's Nancy -- \nNancy, the bartender steps out of the shadows brandishing her rolling pin. \nKarla slips, nearly knocking Julie to the floor. They both scramble upwards -- \nBen hits the ladder -- \nJust as Julie reaches the top rung she SCREAMS -- \nBEN'S HOOK IS ON HER FOOT! \nNancy appears in the opening and throws a brick down at Ben. It hits him in the chest and knocks him back. \nJulie makes it into the attic. They pull the ladder up behind them like a drawbridge. \n78\tINT. HOTEL ATTIC - NIGHT \nJulie, Karla, and Nancy surround the hatch they've just shut. They fumble with it -- \nJULIE There's no way to lock it. \nKARLA What do we do? \nFrom below comes LAUGHTER. There's a tug on the hatch, cracking it open. The girls pull it back shut, but it's hard to get a grip. \nThere's more tugging, the hatch bending down; they can see Ben. Then, the rope SNAPS. The hatch slams shut. \nNANCY There's no way to grip this thing. \nSuddenly the STEEL TIP of the HOOK pokes through the crack...It wriggles around...Turning...And begins to pull the hatch down. \nThey try to hold it...But it's no use. They let go and jump away. \nThe attic is lit by a cathedral window. It's crosshatched with wooden beams and pink insulation. \nNANCY Watch your step... \nTHUNK! Karla's foot goes through a gap between two beams. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n79\tINT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nKARLA'S FOOT \ndangles through the ceiling. \nSMASH BACK TO: \n80\tINT. HOTEL ATTIC - NIGHT \nJulie helps Karla back up onto a beam. \nNANCY (cont'd) Stay on the beams! \nKarla and Julie follow her precarious progress. \nBen climbs off the ladder to a beam. He watches them leap from beam to beam. His hook glints in the light. \nJulie, Karla, and Nancy move toward the cathedral window. They turn. They are cut off. They spread out against the wall looking for an opening to get back to the hatch. \nBen feints toward Nancy then swipes at Julie -- \nHe misses. She leaps away. She looks down. Instead of insulation, she sees a \nWINDOW INTO THE HONEYMOON SUITE \nShe sees her bed through a one-way mirror. Julie stares, momentarily transfixed. Karla is edging her way around the side of Ben. \nBEN (re: the mirror) You'd be amazed by what you'd see. My wife with every man on the island, for example. (to Julie) And you, sexy...I loved watching you. \nJULIE You sick freak. \nBen suddenly whirls and lunges at Karla. He grabs her, but they both lose their balance, teetering for a moment on one of the beams, before falling -- \nThey CRASH through the mirror -- \n81\tINT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nKarla and Ben hit the bed in a rain of glass. \nKarla bounces to her feet and dives out of the way as Ben swings his hook. \n82\tEXT.

They open it and look out. \n84\tEXT. ROOM BALCONY - JULIE'S POV - NIGHT \nand Ben advancing toward Karla, whose back is against the railing. \nNancy tries the first of many keys. Something catches Julie's eye. She moves in for a closer look. Her eyes go wide -- \nORCHID HOUSE - JULIE'S POV \nA powerful BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks. Fills the room with a pulse of bright light. BEN IS STANDING INSIDE AND HE'S HEADING STRAIGHT FOR KARLA. \nJULIE (terrified) He's inside. \nKarla spins. Sees him. Her terrified scream blends with the cranes, now SHRIEKING VIOLENTLY. \nKARLA Please! Hurry! \n92\tINT. HOTEL/ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT \nNancy fumbles with the keys. Drops them. Julie tries to keep calm. \nJULIE Come on... \n93\tINT. HOTEL/ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT \nBen closes fast, slicing the tops off orchids as he goes. He skewers a bud on the tip of his hook. \nKarla pounds on the door. \nKARLA (frantic) Hurry! \nNancy fumbles for the right key but the lock is old. \nJULIE Nancy... \nNANCY (crying) It's jammed! \nThe key is stuck. \nKARLA (through glass) Come on!! \nShe's running out of time. Julie sees a FIRE AXE encased in the glass safety box. \nJULIE (determined) No way!! \nJulie smashes the glass with her elbow. Grabs the axe. \nJULIE (to Nancy) Move! \nJulie hammers the door with the axe. Wood splinters. Glass cracks. \nBen is almost on top of Karla now. \nJulie swings. The axe breaks the glass, pulls the frame out. Julie drops the axe. They grab Karla. Pull her through. \nBen swings. The hook rips Karla's shoe, but Julie and Nancy pull her through. \nJulie and Ben are face to face. Julie has the axe in her hands. She stares him down. \nJULIE Come on, gimme a shot -- \nBen rips off his hook, eyeing Julie. \nKARLA (shouting) Julie, come on. \nThey flee. Ben tries the door, realizes it had locked behind him. He can't fit through the circular window. He throws his shoulder against the door. And again. And again. \nThe door frame starts to give -- \nCUT TO: \n94\tEXT. STORM SHELTER - NIGHT \nJulie, Karla, and Nancy approach the iron door to the underground storm cellar. Julie carries the axe. \nNANCY It's over there. \nThey struggle together to open the heavy door. \n95\tINT. STORM SHELTER - NIGHT \nStairs lead down into darkness. Karla hesitates -- \nKARLA I don't know... \nJULIE Come on, you can make it. \nJulie gets in, pulling Karla in behind her. They pull the door closed behind them. \nNANCY There's a light somewhere. \n96\tINT. STORM SHELTER - NIGHT \nThe darkness is complete. We hear MOVEMENT. \nKARLA Julie? \nJULIE I'm right here. Grab my hand. \nKarla and Nancy go to the area near the check-in and behind the desk. \nNANCY Look up there. I'll look over here. \nKarla looks behind the desk. Nancy is searching the shelves. \nCUT TO: \n101\tINT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT \nJulie tenderly searches the area around Will's stomach. She's fussing with the clothes, looking for the wound. \nJULIE You've got blood everywhere, but I can't find the wound. \nWill takes her head in his hands, looks her in the eye. \nWILL That's because it's not my blood. \nThe slow change in Julie as she realizes... \nShe starts to run. Will roughly grabs her. \nWILL (cont'd) It's time you woke up, Julie. \nHis voice switches to that of a familiar radio disk jockey. \nWILL (cont'd) (as Mark in the Morning) AND START CONTEMPLATING THE ULTIMATE MAGIC GETAWAY! \nHe drags her out of the bar. \nCUT TO: \n102\tINT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT \nNancy sees a white metal box sitting on a shelf. She reaches for it... It's a first aid kit. \nANOTHER HAND \nreaches over and lands on top of her hand.

He's -- \nSuddenly Estes's expression changes to surprise, and \nA SPEAR TIP \nappears in the front of his chest. \nNancy screams and looks over Estes's shoulder to see \nBEN WILLIS \nstanding there holding a spear gun. \nEstes topples over on top of Nancy, pinning her underneath his dying, convulsing body. Nancy struggles to get loose. \nNANCY Help me. \nKarla rushes to Nancy. She tugs on her arm, trying to pull her free. \nThe fisherman strides toward them. He raises his hook. He swings at Karla's head. \nTHE HOOK CATCHES \non a beam. Karla struggle with Nancy. \nKARLA Come on, come on. \nBen tries to free his hook hand. Karla looks up at him. He calmly puts his foot onto Estes's back and steps down with all of his weight, driving \nTHE SPEAR TIP \ndeep into Nancy who expires with a sigh. \nKARLA (cont'd) Damn you. \nKarla, blind with rage, attacks the fisherman. He kicks out with a boot and sends Karla fying onto \nA GLASS TABLE \nin the lobby area. The table explodes. Karla is finished. \nThe fisherman works his hook free from the post. Karla is unmoving and looks quite dead. \nCUT TO: \n103\tEXT. WOOD TRAIL - NIGHT \nWill pulls Julie along a muddy path in the rain. He's got her by the hair.

We finally get to spend some quality time together. \nJulie's trying to get to the knife she's stashed in her back pocket. \nTHE HOOK \ngoes straight into Will's chest. \nThe fisherman has hooked his own son. \nFather and son make final eye contact, the son's eyes go blank. \nBen stares in shock as Will expires, falling back into the mud. \nBen SCREAMS in rage. Ray is tired. \nTHWACK. Ben begins beating Ray. He puches him. He straight-arms him with the hook. He knocks him again and again and Ray is beaten, giving up... \nBen has Ray against a tombstone. The hook slowly inches toward his eye. \nBEN Gonna blind you first. \nThe hook is touching the eyelid -- \nA GUNSHOT \nrings out. A look of wonder crosses Ben's face. He slowly turns away from Ray. \nJULIE \nstands behind him holding the gun. \nJULIE Just...Die. \nBLAM. BLAM. BLAM. She empties the gun into Ben, who flies backward into Julie's grave. \nAs he tumbles, Ben releases the dirt stacked beside the grave... \nA MUDDY LANDSLIDE \nslowly covers Ben up. \nBen's face is covering over. His mouth starting to fill with dirt -- \nBEN You can't kill me. \nHis face is completely covered. His mouth still moving. \nBEN (cont'd) I'll always be with you. \nThe dirt covers him.

But she's all alone in the house of the Lord. \nAnd those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden still rests upon her soul. \nShe reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained CONFESSIONAL BOOTH. \n2\tINT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - DAY \nJulie slides the drapes shut behind her as she enters, kneeling before the CLOSED SCREEN.

This is difficult for her. \nJULIE (cont'd) I've never told anyone this. Not my mom, not the poice, not even my friends -- except for the ones who were there and they...well they're not around anymore. You see I...I... \nPRIEST Yes? \nJULIE I killed a man. Well, I thought I had...then... \nShe balks at the memory of it. The priest bows his head in the shadows of the other side. \nJULIE (cont'd) (emotional) You've got to understand...It was all an accident. A terrible accident. It's been a whole year. I've tried to get past this, but I just can't. \nPRIEST Go on... \nJULIE I have these dreams...horrible dreams. And this man is always there with me. \nPRIEST (reassuring) I know... \nJULIE You see, he was a killer. He murdered Helen and Barry, and he would have killed me too, if I hadn't...gotten away with it. (regathering) I don't know, I guess I just need to deal with the fear, the guilt...to finally say his name. Ben Willis. His name was Ben Willis... \nThe confession is cathartic for Julie. She looks relieved until, \nPRIEST I know... \nJulie stops. Looks through the screen. A chill shoots through her body. \nJULIE You know?

It's gonna get better. \nJULIE It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school. \nBLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EXPLOSIONS. Julie jumps out of her skin.

This is hard to say -- \nJULIE (softly, but resolved) Ray, I can't... \nRAY Can't what? \nJULIE I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand... \nRay is cold. This is what he's expected all along. \n", "test1_id": 2292, "test2_input": "RAY I understand something. \nJULIE It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be. (beat) It just isn't. \nRay is hurt and confused. \nJULIE (cont'd) Hey, why don't you stay up here? They have fireworks over the river. And...there's a million things to do. \nRAY I have to work, Julie. My boat's in Southport, remember? But, I get it. You need your space from Craokerland. And maybe from me, too. \nRay starts walking away. \nRAY (cont'd) You know where to find me. \nJULIE Ray? Ray? At least come up for a while. \nRay keeps on walking. \nRAY It's okay. I'm just gonna go. \nJulie follows him out to the road. A group of LAUGHING STUDENTS block her way. \nJULIE Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... (to herself) I'm just scared...that's all. \nBut Ray is already gone. Julie stares after him a beat, then turns quickly to her door. She clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the walk alone. She nervously pulls her keys. A can of mace dangles from the keychain. \nCUT TO: \n5\tEXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY \nStudents throw FRISBEE in the street. Ray walks to his old truck, which is wedged between a new Sport Utility and a BMW. \nHe clambers into the front seat. He thinks. Then, digs into his pocket and pulls out the unmistakable shape of an ENGAGEMENT RING BOX. He throws it in the glove box, starts the truck and drives away. \nCUT TO: \n6\tINT. JULIE'S APARTMENT DOORWAY - DAY \nJulie opens the door and steps inside. She locks three deadbolts. She stands there, alone, listening to the SILENCE. She doesn't even have a cat. A faucet DRIPS in the kitchen. \n6A\tINT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - DAY \nThe faucet DRIPS. Julie turns the handle. No success. She checks the lock on each window. She stands for a moment. \nShe picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful. She opens the fridge and takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce. She grabs a soft drink and a jar of bread-and-butter pickles. She gets some cookies from a shelf. She thinks. Opens the freezer, pulls out some fat-free sorbet. \nShe takes the whole mess toward her bedroom. \n6B\tINT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - DAY \nShe hits the light switch. A bedside light goes on. It's a sparsely furnished room. The bed is pilled high with pillows. She checks the windows, then climbs into bed with the food. \nOn the bedside table are pictures of family and friends. She looks at one of Helen and Barry. She looks around the room. It's depressing. \nOutside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going places. She picks at the food, then puts it on the table. She turns off the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the room. \nDISSOVE TO: \n6C\tINT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nJulie, sound asleep, is curled into fetal position on the bed. \nThere's a CLICK in the front hall. And ANOTHER. \nJulie's eyes shoot open. She listens. Another SOUND, almost like the front door being CLOSED. \nHer arm reaches for the bedside light. She hits the switch. The bulb POPS. \nJULIE (whispers) Okay. Okay. Face your fears... \nShe gets off the bed and stands still. \nJULIE (cont'd) (whisper) There's nothing... \nThere's another NOISE down the hall. \nJULIE (cont'd) (whisper) Quiet. \nJulie silently scoots out of her bedroom toward the kitchen. \n6D\tINT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nShe gets a large KNIFE. She listens. It sounds like somone's in the living room. She steps through the kitchen door. \nAs she moves we see a shadow pass the other way down the hallway toward her bedroom. \n6E\tINT. JULIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThere's NO ONE there. \nJULIE (cont'd) Okay, calm down, imagination. \nShe relaxes until she sees that her front door is slightly AJAR, light from the hallway slanting through. \n", "test2_true": "Holding the knife in front of her, she tiptoes to the hallway. There's a soft RUSTLING coning from her bedroom. She gets a flashlight out of a drawer and starts down the hallway. \nJULIE (cont'd) (fatalistic) Let's just do it. \nShe moves faster toward her bedroom. she listens outside the doorway. It sounds like someone's in the closet. She moves into the room. \n6F\tINT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThere's a noise in the darkened closet. Julie moves into position. \nShe turns the flashlight ON and lunges for the closet. \nINT THE CLOSET \nKARLA WILSON, 19, all grace and attitude, is on tiptoes reaching for a box of shoes. She SCREAMS. \nJulie SCREAMS. They both SCREAM together. Julie drops the knife and flashlight. \nKARLA I thought you were out of town! \nJULIE What are you doing in my closet? \nThey hug, jumping up and down with relief. \nKARLA I thought you were out of town! \nJULIE What are you doing in my closet? \nKARLA i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them! \nJulie turns on the light in the hallway. Karla has her shoes in her hand and black pants draped over her arm. \nJULIE That was heart attack time, Karla. \nKARLA No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time. \nKarla looks down and sees the knife. She picks it up with two fingers -- \nKARLA (cont'd) And we're going to put away the utensils and you're coming with me. \nJulie flops down on her bed. \nJULIE I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed. \nKARLA Yeah, right -- whatever. \nJULIE I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings. \nKARLA (keeping it upbeat) Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street. \nKarla picks up the flashlight and goes into the closet. \nJULIE There's nothing between Will and me. \nKARLA (V.O.) Yet. Nothing yet. \nShe emerges with clothes for Julie. Holds up one outfit. \nKARLA (cont'd) What we gotta do is keep moving. No time to mope. I'm working at the club tonight. And you, dancing queen, are coming with me. \nJULIE No I'm not. \nKarla holds up another dress for Julie -- strapless, sexy, the one. \nKARLA Fine, then be fat, ugly, and depressed. \nKarla is dancing around. Julie laughs at her friend and takes the dress when Karla hands it to her. \nCUT TO: \n7\tINT. THE CLUB - NIGHT \nIt's a hopping college joint: crowded, loud MUSIC, a dance floor, and rivers of cheap booze. \nAT THE BAR \nJulie sits next to Karla as she waits for her drink order. \nA handsome young man slides in front of them. This is TYRELL MARTIN, 23, handsome, no pretention, a little dangerous, with a killer smile. \nTYRELL You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone. \nKARLA (playful) I don't think so. It's pretty crowded. \nTYRELL Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you. \nHe's looking for a dark corner or a storeroom or something. \nKARLA (teasing) If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it. \nTYRELL I'll talk real slow. \nHe's kissing her ear. She starts to giggle. \n", "test2_id": 2293, "test3_input": "NANCY Not anymore. \nTYRELL He leave you? \nNANCY No. I shot him. \nWill and Tyrell exchange a danger-Will-Robinson glance. \nNANCY (cont'd) What you want is a Dark and Stormy: Vernon's rum, ginger beer, and a touch of Tabasco. Sailors drink it for luck in the hurricane season, trust me. \nACROSS THE BAR \nKarla and Julie walk in talking quietly to one another. \nJULIE Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute -- \nKARLA He's cute...And he's got a crush on you... (off Julie's look) But... \nJULIE (appologetic) I miss Ray...I tried to call him. \nKarla looks at her. She's sincere, but firm. \nKARLA Ray made up his own mind...so, you're free to make up yours. \nJoining the men, but continuing her thought -- \nKARLA (cont'd) For the next foury-eight hours... (joking) Your smile is a frown...turned upside down. \nShe illustrates with her own big smile. \nTYRELL Pretty cool bar. \nKARLA They all start to look the same once you've worked in one. (to Nancy) Am I right, sister? \nNancy reaches out a hand and they touch just the tips of their fingers. \nJULIE (to Nancy) I'm Julie. This is Karla. \nNANCY Nancy. (sarcastic) Welcome to Tower Bay's most happenin' hotspot. \nNancy continues making their cocktails. \nJULIE \nbacks into something, turns and gasps -- it's a statue of an OLD WHALER, complete with HARPOON, WHITE BEARD, and YELLOW SLICKER. \nShe doesn't let Karla see that it upset her. \nNancy puts their drinks down in front of them. \nNANCY Four Dark and Stormies... \nThey all pick up their drinks. \nKARLA (toasting) To a great weekend -- \nWILL Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather! \nKARLA & JULIE I'll drink to that! \nThey drink and toast again. \nKARLA (to Nancy) So what do you do around here for fun? \nNancy looks straight at Will -- \nNANCY Make fun of tourists mainly. (beat) Or let them make fun of themselves... \nShe flips a switch that lights the Karaoke stage. \nKARLA Karaoke -- perfect. \nJULIE Don't even think about it. \nKARLA Okay, I won't. \nShe's already heading for the stage. \nTYRELL Go baby! Go! \nAT THE STAGE \nCLOSE ON the karaoke machine. Karla flips through a binder full of songs. \nKARLA Oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is for somebody who really needs it. (finds one) Ah-hah! One single with extra cheese! \nNANCY (it's true) Everyone thinks their a singer. \nJULIE No way. \nKARLA Yes. \nJULIE No. \n", "test3_true": "JULIE Not me...no way... \nWILL Come on, it'll be fun. \nKARLA Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James. \nBut there will be no mercy. \nKARLA, TYRELL, & WILL (chanting in unison) Ju-lie! Ju-lie! Ju-lie! \nReluctantly she goes to the song book. She sees something particularily awful. \nJULIE You asked for it. (to Tyrell) Song number thirty-nine. \nTyrell nods and punches a few buttons. Julie takes the stage as sappy strings begin to swell. She looks at the MONITOR, then melodramatically at the crowd, and begins to sing -- no, BELT -- Gloria Gaynor's \"I WILL SURVIVE.\" \nJULIE (cont'd) (singing) First I was afraid...I was petrified... (continues singing under) \nWill stands, clapping. Tyrell pounds his chest. Karla flips up her LIGHTER, swaying like a hard-core fan. And Julie continues, crooning out the chorus as the beat kicks in and the gang begins to dance. \nJULIE (cont'd) (singing) I will survive...I will survive... \nANGLE ON THE KARAOKE MONITOR \nThe schmaltzy lyrics keep scrolling by -- white against black. But then...in the middle of the song...the color changes. RED CAPITAL\\ LETTERS BEGIN TO FILL THE SCREEN. \nJULIE (cont'd) (singing -- then trailing off) And I still know...what you did... last summer... \nHer voice trails. Her smile abruptly fades. \nMICROPHONE \nfalls to the floor. The room echoes with an electronic WHUMP. Everyone stops dancing, confused. \nCLOSE - JULIE \ntrembling, shaking, a mess. Will jumps onstage. \nWILL Julie? What's wrong? \nJULIE It's...him. \nWILL What do you mean, Julie? \nJULIE He did something to the screen...it, it, said... \nJulie loos at the screen -- the normal lyrics are still scrolling. She suddenly feels their eyes upon her. They're looking at her like she's having a nervous breakdown. \nJULIE (cont'd) Nothing. Nothing, I'm sorry... \nStung, she rushes off the stage. \nKARLA Julie... \nBut it's to late. She's bolted from the bar. \nCUT TO: \n28\tINT. HOTEL - JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nJulie steps into her room. Closes the door behind her. She falls back against it, trying to calm herself down. \nJULIE There's no way...just stop it right now... \nShe looks around the cozy room. \nJULIE (cont'd) Closet. Bed. Bathroom. No need to panic. \nJulie starts to undress, get ready for bed, the day of travel finally catching up with her. She grabs something to sleep in. Tosses it on the bed. And that's when she sees it, \nCLOSE - ENVELOPE \npropped on the pillows. Her name written across. She is frozen momentarily. \nAlmost against her will, she moves toward the envelope. She reaches down and picks it up. \nShe hesitates, then opens the envelope. She pulls out a SINGLE WHITE CARD. \nANGLE ON THE CARD \nIn bold print it reads: SURPRISE! \nDARKFIGURE \nappears over Julie's shoulder. Julie can feel the presence. She spins, scaring -- \nWILL \nwho YELLS and drops the flowers and champagne he was holding. The bottle bursts and covers them with spray. \nJULIE (realizing) Oh, Will! I'm sorry. \nWILL It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think... \n", "test3_id": 2294}

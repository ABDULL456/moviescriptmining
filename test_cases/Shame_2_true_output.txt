BRANDON Come on. You'll see 
MARIANNE stops. She smiles, quizzically, allowing herself to be guided and yet- 
MARIANNE No, where are we going? (LAUGHS) 
BRANDON Come on. 
80   INT. BATHROOM. STANDARD HOTEL. DAY.                        80 
BRANDON snorts two lines of coke in quick succession on top of the white water tank in the toilet. 
Exiting, we see MARIANNE looking out onto the Hudson from the large hotel window. 
81   INT. BEDROOM. STANDARD HOTEL. DAY.                         81 
BRANDON enters the bedroom, stopping to prepare a drink. Watching MARIANNE at the window. 
BRANDON You wanna drink? 
He pours a drink from the mini bar. 
BRANDON (CONT'D) What are you looking at? 
MARIANNE The view is amazing. 
BRANDON approaches nervously, standing next to her. 
BRANDON Hey. 
MARIANNE leans up and kisses BRANDON. 
MARIANNE (LAUGHS) 
MARIANNE takes BRANDON's hand and leads him to the bed. We see both of them slowly discovering each other through tender touches. 
MARIANNE caresses BRANDON's face and kisses both his eyes. BRANDON attempts to do the same to MARIANNE, slowly but surely. This ritual becomes more aroused, clothes start to fall away, revealing for the first time both each other's flesh. 
BRANDON rolls up her skirt, laughs at her panites. MARIANNE giggles. 
BRANDON (LAUGHS) Are they vintage? 
MARIANNE A little bit. (LAUGHS) 
The ritual begins to get more passionate, as they feel for each other's breasts and thighs. 
At the height of this passionate encounter, BRANDON's attention strangely, slowly starts to fade. It's as if the intimacy that he has discovered starts to frighten him. 
He recoils, unable to continue. 
Both lie on their backs silently, in frustration, breathing heavily. MARIANNE's face is one of puzzlement and hurt. She looks at BRANDON for some kind of answer. He gets up. MARIANNE, unsure what to do, sits up and pulls down her skirt, adjusts her hair. 
82   INT. BEDROOM. STANDARD HOTEL. DAY.                           82 
Late afternoon sunlight seeping across the room- 
BRANDON sits at the edge of the bath looking out onto the view. 
MARIANNE Brandon? Erm... 
MARIANNE looks at him, the moment fragile. She does up her bra. 
MARIANNE (CONT'D) You know, it's cool. It's OK. 
MARIANNE (CONT'D) Should I go? 
BRANDON Sure. 
Hurt, MARIANNE put on her top, picks up her bag and makes to leave 
BRANDON (CONT'D) I can walk you down. 
MARIANNE (O.S.) That's OK. 
SILENCE- 
BRANDON looks back out over the grey of the Hudson River. BRANDON's face is one of embarrassment and failure.

He hears a KNOCK on the DOOR. Cole quickly hides his crossbow under the bed and answers the door. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Tracey stands in the open door. Cole's jaw drops open. He has never seen anything as lovely. 
COLE Yeah? 
TRACEY Make love to me... please. 
She walks into the room. Cole closes the door. 
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE COLE'S DOOR 
Rick and O'Neill run up to the door. They listen closely. We HEAR the SOUND of Cole's SHIRT being RIPPED off, the buttons flying around the room, then the SOUND of his pant ZIPPER being undone. 
RICK T minus... 3... 2... 1. We have ignition. 
e and O'Neill burst into the room and close the door. 
COLE (O.S.) Hey! 
INT. COLE'S ROOM 
O'Neill is tying the end of a sheet around the bed post. We SEE the bed is minus its sheets and blankets. 
O'NEILL All set here. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
The guys have tied the sheets and blankets together and made a rope. The other end is tied around Cole's chest. And that's all Cole is wearing; he's nude. 
COLE You guys are never going to get away with this. 
Rick stuffs Cole's underwear in his mouth to gag him. 
RICK We're just going to keep you in a safe place until after the party. 
He and O'Neill lift Cole up and put him out the window. They hang onto the sheet/blanket rope and lower him slowly outside. 
EXT. HOTEL 
We SEE Cole being lowered from the window. 
CLOSER ON COLE 
He's struggling, but can do nothing about his predicament. He looks down. 
COLE'S POV 
The hotel parking lot is ten stories below. 
COLE 
He looks up to the guys. 
RICK AND O'NEILL 
They look down at him from the window above. 
RICK Now, don't get into any trouble. 
O'NEILL Take care. 
RICK & O'NEILL Byeeeee! 
They duck inside the window. 
INT. COLE'S ROOM 
Rick, O'Neill and Tracey exit the room. 
RICK (to Tracey) Don't you wish you were a guy so you could have fun like this? 
COLE 
He's scared to death. 
INT. COLE'S ROOM 
We SEE that Cole's weight is pulling the bed to the window. 
COLE 
He's slowly lowering down the side of the building. 
INT. ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM

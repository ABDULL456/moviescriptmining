(husky voice) 
About two weeks. 
Sam is coming down the stairs. 
CLARISE 
(to Jonah) 
Pssst! 
Jonah hits the remote control and the channel changes to 
the Disney channel as Sam comes into the room, dressed 
for his date. 
SAM 
Clarise, I'll be back by 
midnight I'm sure -- 
CLARISE 
Whenever. 
Sam tosses Jonah a letter. 
SAM 
This one's for both of us. 
JONAH 
(reading from the 
envelope) 
Sleepless and Son. 
(reading the postmark) 
Baltimore. 
He starts to open the letter. 
SAM 
I left the number of the 
restaurant I'll be at if 
there's any emergency. 
CLARISE 
Fine. 
SAM 
(to Jonah) 
How do I look? 
JONAH 
(absently) 
Great. 
SAM 
(looks in mirror) 
I look stupid.  I look stupid, 
don't I? I look like I'm 
trying too hard.  I was going 
to get a haircut but then I 
thought I'd look like I just 
got a haircut. 
(checks his teeth, 
peers up his nose) 
JONAH 
(reading the letters) 
This is a good letter, Dad. 
SAM 
(checks his fly, looks 
down at his feet) 
The heels on these shoes are 
very large.  Why have I never 
noticed this? The heels on 
these shoes are grotesque. 
JONAH 
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed. 
SAM 
Now I'm late.  Bye. 
He starts toward the door. 
JONAH 
Listen to this -- 
SAM 
Not now, Jonah -- 
JONAH 
Just this one part, okay? 
(reading) 
"I have been an excellent 
third-baseman for as long as I 
or anyone else can remember, 
and I guarantee you will not 
get one past me" 
SAM 
Jonah, I'm leaving -- 
JONAH 
WAIT!!! 
(Sam stops, amazed at 
Jonah's vehemence; 
Jonah continues 
reading) 
-- "and while we're on the 
subject, let's just say right 
now that Brooks Robinson was 
the best third baseman ever. 
It's important that you agree 
with me on that because I'm 
from Baltimore."  Dad, she 
thinks Brooks Robinson is the 
greatest. 
Sam goes out the door with Jonah behind him, waving the 
letter. 
EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 
JONAH 
Dad! 
SAM 
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson 
is the greatest. 
JONAH 
It's a sign. 
SAM 
Oh, right. 
Sam stops, takes Jonah by the hand and takes him back 
into the house. 
SAM 
Come here.  I want to show you 
something. 
INT. HOUSE - NIGHT 
As Sam pulls down the map of the United States, which is 
hanging over one of the kitchen windows and stands Jonah 
in front of it. 
SAM 
Here is Seattle. 
(moves his finger 
across the country) 
And here is Baltimore.  Case

INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI LONG SHOT 
Jeff tries to be pleasant, and offhand. 
JEFF Well -- when'll I see you again?

Lisa, standing in the open doorway. 
LISA Not for a long time. Not, at least until -- (She begins smiling) -- tomorrow night. 
Continues smiling as she close the door softly behind her.

The pleasantness on Jeff's face slowly melts into baffled discouragement. He reaches for a nearby phone picks up the receiver, dials. It buzzes on filter. 
Receiver up on filter. 
GUNNISON (Filter) Hello. 
JEFF Gunnison? 
GUNNISON Yeah. Is that you, Jeff? 
JEFF It's me. 
GUNNISON Something wrong? 
JEFF The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday? 
GUNNISON (Unhappy) Jeff -- 
JEFF (Won't give him time to argue) I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it. 
GUNNISON (Wearily, after pause) Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up. 
JEFF That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy. 
GUNNISON Yeah. 
Jeff hangs up, looks up to the door through which Lisa left. He's not particularly happy.

Jeff returns to the window. He lights a cigarette and smokes it peacefully, as he contemplates the neighborhood. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The CAMERA slowly sweeps over the various apartments with an odd window lit here and there. In the distant street there is still some traffic passing, with one or two pedestrians going by. THE CAMERA completes its sweep, and starts to move back again. Somewhere a dog howls. The PANNING CAMERA comes to a sudden halt.

Jeff smiles a little, but as the howl continues, his expressions sobers. His eyes begin to scan the neighborhood, as if looking for the source. He fails to find it, and sits there, puzzled and disturbed. The scene, and the sound of the dog: 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN:

Jeff's chair is turned facing the window so that we see the darkened room behind him. There is just one side light burning, which illuminates the side of his face. 
His head nods sleepily as he dozes. He opens his eyes and looks out, as a slight sound of rain starts. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT 
From his viewpoint we see the first few drops of rain starting to fall. It is sort, gentle rain, not a downpour. There are still some windows lit in the neighborhood. The apartment house corridors all have small night lights burning.

Jeff wakens a little more fully as his attentions is drawn to: 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
The couple who sleep on the fire escape. The increasing rain cause them to hastily gather their things to retreat inside. The man, hurriedly untying the alarm clock from the railing of the fire escape, lets it slip through his fingers. As if falls to the garden below, the CAMERA FANS SWIFTLY down with it. When the clock hits the ground, the alarm goes off sending a shrill sound through the neighborhood.

Jeff smiles at the incident, and then lowers his eyes slightly as something else catches his attention. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT 
Coming out of his apartment into the corridor on the floor below is the salesman with the nagging wife. The shades are drawn in his apartment, but a light burns dimly behind them. The salesman carries a large aluminum suitcase -- the same one we saw him with earlier in the day. The sound of the alarm startles him. He turns toward the window a moment listening. Then reassured that is is nothing important, he turns and moves down the corridor.

Jeff is puzzled. He looks down a moment in thought. Then he darts his eyes and swings them toward the left. 
He looks steadily toward the distant street corner. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT 
The street corner, lighted by a lamp, is deserted. A moment later, the salesman, still carrying the suitcase, moves diagonally across the corner, head down against the rain.

{"train": "Trainspotting \nScreenplay by \nJohn Hodge \nBased on the Novel by \nIrvine Welsh \nDirected by \nDanny Boyle \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nLegs run along the pavement. They are Mark Renton's. \nJust ahead of him is Spud. They are both belting along. \nAs they travel, various objects (pens, tapes, CDs, toiletries, ties, sunglasses, etc.) either fall or are discarded from inside their jackets. \nThey are pursued by two hard-looking Store Detectives in identical uniforms. The men are fast, but Renton and Spud maintain their lead. \nRENTON (voice-over) \nChoose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family, Choose a fucking big television, Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players, and electrical tin openers. \nSuddenly, as Renton crosses a road, a car skids to a halt, inches from him. \nIn a moment of detachment he stops and looks at the shocked driver, then at Spud, who has continued running, then at the Two Men, who are now closing in on him. \nHe smiles. \nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT ROOM. DAY \nIn a bare, dingy room, Renton lies on the floor, alone, motionless and drugged. \nRENTON (v.o) \nChoose good health, low cholesterol and dental insurance. Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose your friends. \nEXT. FOOTBALL PITCH. NIGHT \nOn a flood lit five-a-side pitch, Renton and his friends are taking on another team at football. \nThe opposition all wear an identical strip (Arsenal), whereas Renton and his friends wear an odd assortment of gear. \nThree girls -- Lizzy, Gail, and Allison and Baby -- stand by the side, watching. \nThe boys are outclassed by the team with the strip but play much dirtier. \nAs each performs a characteristic bit of play, the play freezes and their name is visible, printed or written on some item of clothing. (T-Shirt, baseball cap, shorts, trainers). In Begbie's case, his name appears as a tatoo on his arm. \nSick Boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it. \nBegbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it. \nSpud, in goal, lets the ball in between his legs. \nTommy kicks the ball as hard as he can. \nRenton's litany continues over the action: \nRENTON (v.o) \nChoose leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose a three piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing sprit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you have spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life. \nRenton is hit straight in the face by the ball. He lies back on the astroturf. Voice-over continues. \nBut who would I want to do a thing like that? \nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY \nRenton lies on the floor. \nSwanney, Allison and Baby, Sick Boy and Spud are shooting up or preparing to shoot up. Sick Boy is talking to Allison as he taps up a vein on her arm. \nRENTON (v.o) \nSWANNEY \nSure, sure. I've heard it before. \nRENTON \nThe Sick Boy method. \nThey both look at Sick Boy \nSWANNEY \nYeah, well, it surely worked for him. \nRENTON \nHe's always been lacking in moral fibre. \nSWANNEY \nHe knows a lot about Sean Connery. \nRENTON \nThat's hardly a substitute. \nSWANNEY \nyou'll need one more hit. \nRENTON \nNo, I don't think so. \nSWANNEY \nTo see you through the night that lies ahead. \nFreeze Frame on Swanney. \nRENTON (v.o) \nWe called him the mother superior on account of the length of his habit. He knew all about it. On it, off it, he knew it all. Of course I'd have another shot: after all, I had work to do. \nINT. RENTON'S FLAT ROOM. DAY \nThe door opens and Renton enters carrying shopping bags. He empties them on to a mattress beside three buckets and a television. \nRENTON (v.o) \nRelinquishing junk. Stage One: preparation. For this you will need: one room which you will not leave; one mattress; tomato soup, ten tins of; mushroom soup, eight tins of, for consumption cold; ice cream, vanilla, one large tub of; Magnesia, Milk of, one bottle; paracetamol; mouth wash; vitamins; mineral water; Lucozade; pornography; one bucket for urine, one for feces, and one for vomitus; one television; and one bottle of Valium, which I have already procured, from my mother, who is, in her own domestic and socially acceptable way, also a drug addict. \nRenton swallows several Valium tablets. Voice-over continues. \nAnd now I'm ready. All I need is a final hit to soothe the pain while the Valium takes effect. \nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY \nSwanney, Sick Boy, Spud and Allison and Baby all lie inert while the telephone rings. \nINT. CALL BOX. DAY \nRenton curses as he slams down the receiver. He dials again. \nRENTON \nMikey. It's Mark Renton. Can you help me out? \nINT. MIKEY'S FLAT. DAY \nRenton holds two opium suppositories in the palm of his hand. \nRENTON (v.o) \nThis was typical of Mikey Forrester. \n(on screen) \nWhat the fuck are these? \nHis head is over the bowl now. Gradually he reaches still further until his head is lowered into the bowl, followed by his neck, torso, other arm, and finally his legs, all disappearing. \nThe cubicle is empty. \nINT. UNDER WATER. DAY \nRenton, dressed as before, swims through murky depths until he reaches the bottom, where he picks up the suppositories, which glow like luminous pearls, before heading up towards the surface again. \nINT. HORRIBLE TOILET CUBICLE. DAY \nThe toilet is empty. \nSuddenly Renton appears through the bowl, then his arms as he lifts himself out. Still clasping his two suppositories, he walks out of the toilet. \nINT. RENTON'S ROOM. DAY \nThe mattress, buckets and supplies are laid out as before. \nThe door opens and Renton enters, still soaking and dripping. \nThe suppositories are in his hand. He holds them up, and they twinkle in the light. \nRENTON \nNow. Now I'm ready. \nINT. RENTON'S ROOM. DAY \nThe cans of soup, the bottle of water, and the carton of ice cream are empty, the bottle of pills spilt, the magazines well thumbed. \nSICK BOY \nYou Only Live Twice? \nRENTON \nNineteen-sixty-seven. \nSICK BOY \nRunning time? \nRENTON \nOne hundred and sixteen minutes. \nSICK BOY \nDirector? \nRENTON \nLewis Gilbert. \nSICK BOY \nScreenwriter? \nRENTON \nEh - Ian Fleming? \nSICK BOY \nFuck off! He never wrote any of them. \nRENTON \nOK, so who was it, then? \nSICK BOY \nYou can look it up. \nSick Boy throws across a worn copy of a film guide. \nRenton cannot be bothered to pick it up. \nHow are you feeling since you came off the skag? For myself, I'm bored. \nRENTON \nOK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make? \nEXT. PARK. DAY \nSick Boy rests the gun down. \nSICK BOY \nAll I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory. \nRENTON \nWhat about The Untouchables? \nSICK BOY \nI don't rate that at all. \nRENTON \nDespite the Academy award? \nSICK BOY \nThat means fuck all. The sympathy vote. \nRENTON Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it? SICK BOY \nYeah. \nRENTON \nThat's your theory? \nSICK BOY \nYeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated. \nRENTON \nGive me the gun. \nEXT. PARK. DAY Through the sight again. This time a Skinhead and his muscle-bound dog are in view. \nSick Boy and Renton talk like Sean Connery. \nSICK BOY \nDo you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights? \nRENTON \nClear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem. \nThe gun fires and the dog yelps, jumps up and bites its owner (the Skinhead). \nSICK BOY \nFor a vegetarian, Rents, you're a fucking evil shot. \nEXT. PARK. DAY \nRenton loads up again. \nRENTON (v.o) \nWithout heroin, I attempted to lead a useful and fulfilling life as a good citizen. \nINT. CAF\u00c9. DAY \nTwo milkshakes clink together. \nRenton and Spud and seated at a booth, dressed in their own fashion for job interviews. \nRENTON \nGood luck, Spud. \nMAN 1 \nDo you recall the school motto? \nRENTON \nOf course, the motto, the motto -- \nMAN 1 \nStrive, hope, believe and conquer. \nRENTON \nExactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world. \nRenton looks pious under scrutiny. \nMAN 2 \nMr. Renton -- \nRENTON \nYes. \nMAN 2 \nYou seem eminently suited to this post but I wonder if you could explain the gaps in your employment record? \nRENTON \nYes, I can. The truth -- well, the truth is that I've had a long-standing problem with heroin addiction. I've been know to sniff it, smoke it, swallow it, stick it up my arse and inject it into my veins. I've been trying to combat this addiction, but unless you count social security scams and shoplifting, I haven't had a regular job in years. I feel it's important to mention this. \nThere is silence. \nA paper clip crashes to the floor. \nINT. OFFICE. DAY \nThe same office. The same team are interviewing Spud. \nSPUD \nNo, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am. \nMAN 1 \nMr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application? \nSPUD \nOnly to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right? \nMAN 1 \nYou were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you \"foot in the door\", as you put it. \nSPUD \nHey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it? \nMAN 2 \nMr. Murphy, what attracts you to the leisure industry? \nSPUD \nIn a word, pleasure. My pleasure in other people's leisure. \nWOMAN \nWhat do you see as your main strengths? \nSPUD \nI love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars. \nWOMAN \nI read it in Cosmopolitan. \nLIZZY \nIt's an interesting theory. \nGAIL \nActually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy. \nLIZZY \nWhat, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday? \nGAIL \nWhat happened? \nLIZZY \nHe forgot. Useless motherfucker. \nINT. NIGHTCLUB. DANCE AREA. NIGHT \nTommy and Spud seated as before. Their words are subtitled. \nAs they are speaking Gail and Lizzy return and sit down. \nTOMMY \nUseless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us. \nSPUD \nThat's fair enough. \nTOMMY \nYes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night. \nSPUD \nWent ballistic? \nTOMMY \nBig time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.' \nSPUD \nSo what's it going to be? \nTOMMY \nWell, I've paid for the ticket. \nGAIL AND LIZZY \nWhat are you two talking about? \nTOMMY AND SPUID \nFootball. What were you talking about? \nGAIL and LIZZY \nShopping \nStanding nearby but apart from them is Renton. \nRenton notes Spud and Tommy with their partners, and across the other side Sick Boy and Begbie are engaged in flirtatious conversation with Two Women. \nRENTON (v.o) \nThe situation was becoming serious. Young Renton noticed the haste with which the successful, in the sexual sphere as in all others, egregated themselves from the failures. \nBegbie and Sick Boy with the Two Women. \nRenton standing among a group of lone nerds. \nI think I left something back at the - \nThe girl has disappeared into the back of the taxi. \nRenton looks around. \nTAXI DRIVER \nAre you getting in or not, pal? \nEXT. ROAD. NIGHT \nThe taxi motors along. \nINT. TAXI. NIGHT \nRenton and Diane are kissing passionately in the back. \nEXT. STREET. NIGHT \nSpud is pushed against the wall held by his lapels. He drinks from a bottle of beer in one hand. \nGAIL \nDo you understand? \nSpud nods drunkenly. \nGail releases her grip. \nOur relationship is not being redefined; it is developing in an appropriate, organic fashion. I expect you to be a considerate and thoughtful lover, generous but firm. Failure on your part to live up to these very reasonable expectations will result in swift resumption of a non-sex situation. Right? \nSpud drinks from a bottle in the other hand and says nothing but he does not look too happy. \nINT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT \nTommy and Lizzy kiss while Tommy unlocks the door. \nINT. DIANE'S HOME, HALLWAY. NIGHT \nIn a darkened suburban hallway, the door opens and two figures enter. \nRENTON \nDiane. \nDIANE \nSsshh! \nRENTON \nSorry. \nDIANE \nShut up. \nThey walk through another door and close it behind them. \nINT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT \nTommy and Lizzy kiss against the inside of th door, taking their outer clothes off. \nINT. DIANE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT \nBy a pale bedside light, Diane and Renton undress. \nINT. GAIL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT \nSpud is lying unconscious on the bed. Gail stands over him. \nGAIL \nWake up, Spud, wake up. Sex. \nShe kicks him. He moans. \nCasual sex. \nDIANE \nAnd don't make any noise. \nINT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT \nThe lights are full on now. Lizzy sits on the bed clutching a blanket around herself. \nTommy hops around in his underwear, searching desperately. \nAll the videos are opened and scattered everywhere. LIZZY \nWhat do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy? \nTOMMY \nIt'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake. \nLIZZY \nReturned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick. \nINT. DIANE'S HOME, LIVING-ROOM. MORNING \nRenton lies submerged under a blanket. \nThe sounds of a normal morning travel from a room nearby: whistles, radio, voices. \nRenton peeps over the edge of the blanket, then covers his head again. \nINT. GAIL'S BEDROOM. MORNING \nSpud opens his eyes. With his fingers, he feels crusted liquid around his mouth. \nAbruptly he turns around: the bed is soaked in vomit. \nHe looks under the cover and drops it again in revulsion. \nINT. DIANE'S HOME, LIVING-ROOM. DAY \nRenton pulls himself up off the sofa and dresses as quickly as possible. \nINT. GAIL'S BEDROOM. DAY \nSpud wipes the vomit from his chest with a pillowcase, which he dumps in the middle of the sheets before gathering the whole lot up as a bundle. \nINT. DIANE'S HOME, HALL/KITCHEN. DAY \nThe door swings open. A Man and a Woman, about Renton's age, sit at the kitchen table. They look up to see Renton in the doorway. MAN \nGood Morning. \nWOMAN \nCome in and sit down. You must be Mark. \nRenton walks to the table and sits down. RENTON \nYes, that's me. \nWOMAN \nYou're a friend of Diane's? \nRENTON \nMore of a friend of a friend, really. \nMAN \nRight. \nRENTON \nAre you her flatmates? \nThe couple exchange a look and laugh. WOMAN \nFlatmates. I must remember that one. \nIt looks easy, this, but it's not. It looks like a doss, like a soft option, but living like this, it's a full-time business. \nHe injects. \nINT. SHOP. DAY \nRenton, Spud, and Sick Boy are stuffing objects into their shirts and pockets. \nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY \nRenton lies back, narcotized. \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nRenton and Spud are running along the street. Two uniformed Store Detectives are running after them. Sick Boy stands in a doorway. As the Detectives run past, he strolls away in the opposite direction. \nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY \nRenton lies back as before. SICK BOY \nUrsula Andress was the quintessential Bond girl. That's what everyone says. The embodiment of his superiority to us: beautiful, exotic, highly sexual and yet unavailable to everyone but him. Shite. Let's face it: if she'd shag one punter from Edinburgh, she'd shag the fucking lot of us. \nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. LATER \nSpud cooks up, watched by Swanney. Nearby lie the drugged forms of Renton, Sick Boy and Allison and Baby. \nINT. RENTON FAMILY HOME, LIVING-ROOM. NIGHT \nRenton's Mother and Father sit reading the paper and a magazine. \nINT. RENTON FAMILY HOME, PARENTS' BEDROOM. NIGHT \nRenton trawls through drawers and any containers (shoe boxes, make-up boxes, under the mattress, etc.) until he finds some cash/jewelry. \nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY \nRenton lies back, staring vacantly ahead. Tommy flops down beside him. Renton shows barely a flicker of awareness. TOMMY \nLizzy's gone, Mark, she's gone and fucking dumped me. It was the video tape and that Iggy Pop business and all sorts of other stuff. She told me where to go and no mistake. I said, is there any chance of getting back together, like, but no way, no fucking way. \nINT. HOSPITAL WARD SITTING-ROOM. DAY \nA few elderly patients sit in armchairs watching daytime television. Renton and Spud jump and climb through an open window. Watched by the helpless patients, they calmly disconnect the television and take it with them as they leave by the same route. \nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY \nRenton and Tommy slumped side by side as before. TOMMY \nI want to try it, Mark. You're always going on about how it's the ultimate hit and that. Better than sex. Come on, I'm a fucking adult. I want to find out for myself. \nRenton huddles up and leans away from Tommy. I've got the money. Tommy produces ten pounds from his pocket. \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nRenton and Spud run along the street. \nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY \nTommy lies drugged on the floor. \nINT. FLAT TO BE BURGLED. DAY \nThe door of an ordinary flat is kicked open. Begbie walks in, crowbar in hand, followed by Sick Boy and Spud. \nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY \nSICK BOY \nHonor Blackman a.k.a. Pussy Galore, what a total fucking misnomer. I wouldn't touch her with yours. I'd sooner shag Col Kreb. At least you know where you are with a woman like that. Not much to look at, like, but personality, that's what counts, that's what keeps a relationship going through the years. Like heroin. I mean, heroin's got fucking great personality. \nSick Boy opens the heel of a his shoe to reveal a syringe. \nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY \nSwanney hands over a small bag of heroin in exchange for ten pounds from Renton. \nINT. FLAT TO BE BURGLED, KITCHEN. DAY \nSpud checks the fridge and pulls out a large chunk of deep-frozen meat. He hits with the crowbar until it fractures and splits. Inside there is some jewellery. \nWell, at least we knew who the father was now. It wasn't just the baby that died that day. Something inside Sick Boy was lost and never returned. It seemed he had no theory with which to explain a moment like this. \nINT. SHOP. DAY \nRenton, Spud and Sick Boy are stuffing their pockets, as seen before. Renton's theft is interrupted by Diane's voice. DIANE \nHello there, Mark. \nDiane is standing just beside him. \nWhat are you doing? \nRenton is speechless, but a few stolen items fall from inside his jacket down to the floor. Diane looks down. Spud and Sick Boy start to snigger. One of the Store Detectives become aware of the group. He starts walking towards them. \nYou didn't tell me you were a thief. \nSPUD \nHey, go easy, lady. The boy's got a habit to support. \nSICK BOY \nOpium doesn't just grow on trees, you know. \nA few more items fall from Renton's jacket as the store Detective closes in. Renton looks at Diane. \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nRenton and Spud are running, pursued by the Two Store Detectives. RENTON (v.o) Nor did I. Our only response was to keep on going and fuck everything. Pile misery upon misery, heap it up on a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile, then squirt it into a stinking purulent vein and do it all over again. Keep on going: getting up, going out, robbing, stealing, fucking people over, propelling ourselves with longing towards the day it would all go wrong. As seen in the opening scene, Renton is nearly hit by a car that screeches to a halt as he crosses a road. He looks at the driver, at Spud running away and the Store Detectives approaching. (v.o) Because no matter how much you stash or how much you steal, you never have enough. No matter how often you go out and rob and fuck people over you always need to get up and do it all again. Renton smiles and waits. (v.o) Sooner or later, this sort of thing was bound to happen. One of the Detectives runs straight past him, after Spud. The other Detective crashes into Renton with a mighty punch in the stomach. \nINT. COURT. DAY \nSpud and Renton stand in the dock. Renton's Mother and Father, Sick Boy, Begbie, and Spud's Mother (Mrs. Murphy) are among those in the gallery. The Sheriff delivers his sentence. SHERIFF \n...because shoplifting is theft, which is a crime, and, despite what you may believe, there is no such entity as victimless crime. Heroin addiction may explain your actions, but it does not excuse them. Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of regret or remorse. In sentencing you to six months' imprisonment my only worry is that it will not be long before we meet again. Mr Renton, I understand that you have entered into a programme of rehabilation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin. The suspension of your sentence is conditional upon your continued cooperation with this programme. Should you stand guilty before me again, I shall not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence. \nRENTON \nThank you, your honour. With God's help, I'll conquer this affliction. \nThe Sheriff and Renton stare at one another for a moment. Renton turns to look at Spud, then back towards the Sheriff, who is now leaving the court. (v.o) \nWhat can you say? Well, Begbie had a phrase for it. \nINT. PUB I. DAY \nThe pub is crowded. Around Renton are his mother, Father, Begbie, Sick Boy and Gav. BEGBIE \nIt was fucking obvious that that cunt was going to fuck some cunt. \nThere is a round to nodding and 'poor Spud'ing. Everyone begins to talk at once. FATHER \nI hope you've learned your lesson, son. \nMOTHER \nOh, my son, I thought I was going to lose you there. You're nothing but trouble to me, but I still love you. \nBEGBIE \nClean up your act, sunshine. Cut that shite out for ever. \nMOTHER \nYou listen to Francis, Mark, he's talking sense. \nBEGBIE \nFucking right I am. See, inside, you wouldn't last two fucking days. \nSICK BOY \nThere's better things that the needle, Rents. Choose life. \nHe winks. MOTHER \nI remember when you were a baby, even when you would never do what you were told. \nBEGBIE \nHe hands Renton the syringe. Renton inject, then lies back on the dirty, red, carpeted floor. He lies completely still. His pupils shrink. His breathing becomes slow, shallow and intermittent. He sinks into the floor until he is lying in a coffin-shaped and coffin-sized pit, lined by the red carpet. Swanney stands over him. SWANNEY \nPerhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi? \nAn ambulance siren becomes faintly audible. \nINT. SWANNEY'S STAIRWELL. NIGHT \nThe siren is a little louder. Swanney holds Renton under his arms and drags him backwards down the steps. \nEXT. STREET. NIGHT \nAs Swanney emerges, still dragging Renton, the siren grows louder and then an ambulance speeds by without stopping. Swanney drags Renton across the pavement and into the open door of a waiting taxi. Swanney then steps out of the taxi's other door, pausing only to tuck a ten-pound note into Renton's pocket before closing the door. \nINT. TAXI. NIGHT \nRenton lies on the floor of the taxi, as Swanney left him, rolling slightly as the taxi takes a corner. \nEXT. HOSPITAL/TAXI. NIGHT \nThe taxi is stationary. We do not see the driver's face but his hand opens the door and then drags Renton out on to the pavement by his ankles before taking the ten pound note, getting back in the cab and driving away. Renton lies on the pavement. Two Porters life him by arms and ankles on to a trolley. We do not see the Porters's faces as they wheel Renton into the hospital. \nINT. HOSPITAL ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. NIGHT \nRenton is wheeled through the department, then into a bay surrounded by a white nylon curtain. \nINT. TROLLEY BAY. NIGHT \nThe Porters lift Renton from one trolley on to another, then leave him alone in the bay surrounded by the curtain. Renton lies alone. His breathing is still shallow and erratic. Around him is the usual accident and emergency paraphernalia: blood pressure machine, oxygen tap, bandages, etc. A Doctor comes in and gives Renton an injection, then leaves. DOCTOR \nWake up. Wake up. \nRenton breathes more easily. \nThe Two Porters return with another trolley. They lift Renton roughly on to it and wheel him away. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. NIGHT \nThe Porters wheel Renton along. \nINT. WARD. NIGHT \nThe Porters lift Renton off the trolley and dump him on the bed. A nurse sticks a thermometer in his mouth. \nINT. WARD. DAY \nRenton's Father and Mother lift Renton, now fully conscious, off the bed and dump him in a wheelchair. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. DAY \nMother walks ahead. Behind her, Father pushes Renton in the wheelchair. \nINT. TAXI. DAY \nMother and Father sit on either side of Renton. \nINT. RENTON'S BEDROOM. DAY \nFather shoves Renton on to the bed, then walks out past Mother, who looks at Renton for a moment before closing the door. \nINT. OTHER SIDE OF RENTON'S BEDROOM DOOR. DAY \nRenton's Father's hand slides three bolts across to lock the door. \nINT. RENTON'S BEDROOM. DAY \nRenton lies on the bed. RENTON (v.o) \nI don't feel the sickness yet, but it's in the post, that's for sure. I'm in the junky limbo at the moment, too ill to sleep, too tired to stay awake, but the sickness is on its way. Sweat, chills, nausea, pain and craving. Need like nothing else I have ever known will soon take hold of me. It's on the way. \nThe door opens. Renton's Mother walks in with a bowl of soup and a piece of bread. Father watches from the doorway. MOTHER \nWe'll help you, son. You'll stay with us until you get better. We'll beat this together. \nRENTON \nMaybe I could go back to the clinic. \nMOTHER \nFanfare. \nAnd now, question number three: is he guilty or not guilty? \nMOTHER \nHe's our son. \nDOCTOR \nIs the correct answer. \nFanfare. \nAnd now it's time to 'Take the Test'. \nLights flash. Music. A garish Hostess walks on with two envelopes. She holds them out for Mother to choose one. \nINT. CONSULTING ROOM. DAY \nThe Doctor watches in silence as the Hostess, now dressed as a medical technician, draws blood from Renton's arm and puts it into a tube. She marks the tube with a pre-printed, numbered label. \nINT. STUDIO. DAY \nMother opens one of the envelopes. She is speechless with joy. The plastic booth opens up. Lights flash again, etc. Renton steps out. \nINT. SOCIAL CLUB. NIGHT \nRenton, his Mother and Father sit at a table in the local social club. It is a Saturday night and the club is busy. Everyone sits in rapt silence. It is not initially clear what is going on. Near the bar a Caller with a microphone calls over the PA - Two and four, twenty-four...seven...fifteen...clickety-click, sixty-six - And so on, as he draws the numbers from the drum. Everyone studies their cards, except Renton, who studies the people instead, his drink untouched. The number-calling continues until suddenly interrupted by Mother's voice. MOTHER Mark...Mark, you've got a house. House! House! For goodness's sake, Mark. They bustle around him and pass his card to the front. RENTON (v.o) \nIt seems, however, that I really am the luckiest guy in the world. Several years of addiction right in the middle of an epidemic, surrounded by the living dead, but not me -- I'm negative. It's official. And once the pain goes away, that's when the real battle starts. Depression. Boredom. You feel so fucking low, you'll want to fucking top yourself. \nHis mother counts a wad of money in front of him. \nEXT. HOUSING ESTATE. DAY \nOn the door of a flat 'plaguer', 'HIV', and 'junky AIDS scum' are daubed on the walls. The sound of a ball being regularly bounced against a wall can be heard. \nINT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT \nIt is poorly furnished. Tommy is seated. Renton has the football, which he kicks against the wall and catches, then drops and kicks again, and so on. The ball is slightly flat. RENTON \nAre you getting out much? \nTOMMY \nNo. \nRENTON \nFollowing the game at all? \nTOMMY \nNo. \nRENTON \nNo. Me Neither. \nRenton drops the ball. It rolls to a halt in the corner. He sits down. TOMMY \nYou take the test? \nRENTON \nAye. \nTOMMY \nClear? \nRENTON \nAye. \nTOMMY \nThat's nice. \nas he is wanted by the police in connection with an armed robbery in a jeweller's in Corstorphine. Take care. Yours with love, Diane. \nThere is a buzz at the door. Renton re-examines the letter. There is another buzz. RENTON \nOh no. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BEDSIT. NIGHT \nRenton opens the door to an unseen figure. It is Begbie. \nINT. BEDSIT. NIGHT \nRenton sits on the bed. Begbie stands over him, pointing a gun at his head. He pulls the trigger. It clicks harmlessly. BEGBIE \nArmed robbery? With a replica? How can it be armed robbery? It's a fucking scandal. \nHe 'fires' the gun a few more times at his own head, then chucks it to the floor. \nAnd the haul. Look. \nHe digs a few rings out of his pocket and throws them to Renton. \nSolid silver, my arse. I took it to a fence -- it's trash, pure trash. There's young couples investing all their hopes in that stuff, and what are they getting? \nRENTON \nIt's a scandal, Franco. \nBEGBIE \nToo right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way. \nINT. BEDSIT. DAY \nBegbie is sitting on the bed in his underwear, eating cereal while watching television. A small carry-out is nearby. Renton finishes dressing for work. He pauses at the open door, looking back towards his guest. RENTON (v.o) \nBegbie settled in in no time at all. \nBegbie opens a can of beer. Renton closes the door. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BEDSIT. DAY \nRenton closes his door. He is about to walk away when he heard Begbie shouting. BEGBIE (from the bedsit) \nRents, Rents, come fucking back here. \nRenton opens the door. Begbie is holding out an empty packet of cigarettes. \nLook. \nRENTON \nWhat? \nBEGBIE \nI've no fucking cigarettes. \nBegbie throws the packet down to the floor. It lands near the door. He has turned back to the television and takes a swig of beer. RENTON \nRight. \nRenton closes the door again. \nINT. BEDSIT. NIGHT \nRenton and Begbie lie in the single bed with their heads at opposite ends. Begbie snores. Renton is wide awake, with a pair of smelly- socked feet only inches from his nose. RENTON (v.o) \nYeah, the guy's a psycho, but it's true, he's a mate as well, so what can you do? \nINT. LONDON BEDSIT. DAY \nWhere the first empty packet of cigarettes fell to the floor there is now a large heap of empty packets: the product of weeks at sixty a day. Another one lands on the pile. Begbie, still in his underwear, still can in hand, sits watchig the racing as before. Behind his, cigarettes and alcohol are stacked up like a miniature duty-free warehouse. Renton sits behind him, reading a book. BEGBIE \nHey, I'm wanting a bet put on. \nRENTON \nCan you not go yourself. \nRENTON \nI can't believe you did that. \nSICK BOY \nI got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money. \nRENTON \nIt was my fucking television. \nSICK BOY \nWell, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that? \nHe takes Renton's fish supper and adds it to his own. \nHave you got a passport? \nRENTON \nWhy? \nSICK BOY \nWell, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price. \nRENTON \nWhy would I want to sell my passport? \nSICK BOY \nIt was just an idea. \nINT. LEFT LUGGAGE ROOM. DAY \nRenton drops his passport into an envelope and throws the envelope into a locker. He turns the key and pockets it. RENTON (v.o) \nI had to get rid of them. Sick Boy didn't do his drug deal and he didn't get rich. Instead, he and Begbie just hung around my bedsit looking for things to steal. I decided to put them in the worst place in the world. \nEXT. BUSY LONDON ROAD. DAY \nTraffic floods past as before. \nINT. LONDON FLAT. DAY \nInside the flat that Renton showed the couple around. Sick Boy and Begbie are standing in the hallway. Renton is in the open doorway. He throws them the keys and leaves. \nINT. LONDON BEDSIT. NIGHT \nThe cramped bedsit is a mess, filled with litter and unwashed clothes. Renton lies on his bed, content to be alone. \nINT. LONDON FLAT. NIGHT \nThe flat is in darkness. The door opens a figure enters. It is the man from Renton's office. RENTON (v.o) \nBut, of course, they weren't paying any rent, so when my boss found two desperate suckers who would, Sick Boy and Begbie were bound to feel threatened. \nMan is followed by another couple. He switches on a light. MAN \nAs you can see, it's a beautiful conversion. Two bedrooms, kitchen/diner. Fully fitted. Lots of storage. All mod cons. Three hundred and twenty quid a week. \nFrom nowhere, Begbie and Sick Boy spring out at him. \nINT. BEDSIT. DAY \nRenton looks around the stripped, empty bedsit one last time before closing the door as he leaves. \nRENTON (v.o) \nAnd that was that. But by then we had another reason to go back. Tommy. \nEXT. RAILWAY. DAY \nAn InterCity train speeds by. \nINT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT \nHow much? \nSICK BOY \nAbout four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ----------} \nRENTON \nSo? \nSICK BOY \nSo he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London. \nRENTON \nSo we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal? \nBEGBIE \nYeah. \nThere is silence. RENTON \nWhat was your price? \nSICK BOY \nFour Grand. \nRENTON \nBut you don't have the money? \nSICK BOY \nWe're two thousand short. \nRENTON \nThat's tough. \nSICK BOY \nCome on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London. \nRENTON \nSorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds. \nBEGBIE \nYes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement. \nRENTON \nJesus. \nBEGBIE \nTwo thousand, one hundred and thirty-three pounds. \nRENTON \nFour kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again? \nSPUD \nI want the money, Mark, that's all. \nBEGBIE \nIf everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail. \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nRenton is visible first, apparently talking to himself, then Diane. RENTON \nIt's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six. \nRenton cooks up in the bus toilet. RENTON (v.o) \nThis was to be my final hit. But let's be clear about this: there's final hits and final hits. What kind was this to be? {----------Some final hits are actually terminal one way or another, while others are merely transit points as you travel from station to station on the junky journey through junky life. \nINT. BUS. NIGHT \nBegbie sits grimly. The others are relaxed. RENTON (v.o) \nThis was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton. \nBEGBIE \nDid you bring the cards? \nSICK BOY \nWhat? \nBEGBIE \nThe cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards. \nSICK BOY \nWell, I've not brought them. \nBEGBIE \nIt's fucking boring after a while without the cards. \nSICK BOY \nWell, I've not brought them. \nBEGBIE \nIt's fucking boring after a while without the cards. \nSICK BOY \nI'm sorry. \nBEGBIE \nBit fucking late, like. \nSICK BOY \nWell, why didn't you bring them? \nBEGBIE \nBecause I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt. \nSICK BOY \nChrist. \nEXT. LONDON. DAY \nThe bus travels through London. \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nThe gang enter a cheap hotel. Begbie's bag contains the heroin. \nINT. HOTEL. DAY \nThey are met by Andreas, a man in his late thirties of Mediterranean appearance. He shakes Sick Boy's hand. ANDREAS \nThese are your friends? \nSICK BOY \nThese are the guys I told you about. \nANDREAS \nOK. \nSPUD \nI got the last one. \nRENTON \nIt's your round Franco. \nBegbie stands up. BEGBIE \nOK. Same again? \nSICK BOY \nI'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK? \nRENTON \nThe moment you turn your back, we're out that door. \nSick Boy walks away towards the toilet. SICK BOY \nI'll be right after you. \nBEGBIE \nYou'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back -- \nRENTON \nWe'll be half-way down the road with the money. \nBEGBIE \nI'd fucking kill you. \nRENTON \nI guess you would, Franco. \nBegbie walks away to the bar. Spud and Renton look at each other and the bag of money. \nAre you game for it? \nSpud looks at the bag and around the pub towards the toilet door and Begbie. Begbie stands at the bar, awaiting the pints. \nWell? \nSPUD \nAre you serious? \nRenton looks around. RENTON \nI don't know. What do you think? \nSpud says nothing. Suddenly they are interrupted. SICK BOY \nStill here, I see. \nSick Boy sits down. RENTON \nWhy not? I know I would. Where's Franco? \nRenton turns to see Begbie making his way through the crowd with the pints helf precariously. As he reaches the table a Man standing with a group of friends accidentally nudges Begbie, causing a pint to spill over him. BEGBIE \nFor fuck's sake. \nMAN \nSorry, mate, I'll get you another. \nBEGBIE \nAll down my fucking front, you fucking idiot. \nMAN \nLook, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. \n", "test1_input": "Begbie, his story complete, finishes his pint. The others continue to stare at him, frozen as though expecting something more. Begbie smiles and throws the pint over his head. \nFreeze-frame: the glass in mid-air and Begbie's smiling face. \nRENTON (v.o) \nAnd that was it. That was Begbie's story. Or at least that was Begbie's version of the story. But a couple of days later I got the truth from Tommy. It was one of his major weaknesses: he never told lies, never took drugs, and never cheated on anyone. \nINT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY \nRenton's hand flicks through a long row of videos on the floor while the sound of weights being lifted (by Tommy) emanates from nearby. \nMost of the videos are feature films or comedy shows, some with titles written in Tommy's hand, but two catch Renton's attention. \nThey are 100 Great Goals and Tommy and Lizzy Vol. 1, the latter a handwritten title. \nRenton looks from the video round to Tommy, who is engrossed in lifting weights. \nTOMMY \nWell, sure it was Wednesday morning, we were in the Volley playing pool, that much is true. \nINT. POOL HALL. DAY \nTommy's account over a depiction of his version. \nTOMMY (v.o) \nBut Begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash. He's got a hangover so bad he can hardly hold the fucking cue, never mind pot the ball. I'm doing my best to lose, trying to humour him, like, but it's not doing any good: every time I touch the ball I pot something, every time Begbie goes near the table he fucks it up. So he's got the hump, right, but finally I manage to set it up so all he's go to do is pot the black to win one game and salvage a little pride and maybe not kick my head in, right. So he's on the black, pressure shot, and it all goes wrong, big time. What does he do? Picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuses him of putting him off by looking at him. Can you believe it? I mean, the poor cunt hasn't even glanced in our direction. He's sitting there quiet as a mouse when Beggars gubs him with the cue. He was going to chib him, I tell you, then I thought he was going to do me. The Beggar is fucking psycho, but he's a mate, you know, so what can you do? \nThe events are as follows: \nBegbie and Tommy are playing pool. \nBegbie, furious, miscues, goes in off, etc. \nTommy deliberately misses sitters and tries to look annoyed. \nBegbie lines up to play the black. It is unmissable. \nAt the bar beyond sits a harmless young Man, wearing the same clothes as the Hard Man in Begbie's account except that they are now baggy rather than taut. He is clearly not staring at Begbie but drinks a half-pint and eats some crisps. \nAs Begbie plays, the Man bites a crisp. \nBegbie miscues, rips the cloth and the ball flies off the table. \nTommy catches it and looks up to see Begbie assaulting the young Man. \nTommy cautiously restrains Begbie and he reaches into his jacket for a knife. \nBegbie turns and for a moment looks as though he might attack Tommy. \nINT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY \nTommy puts down his weights. \nRenton holds up 100 Great Goals. \nRENTON \nCan I borrow this one? \nINT. PUB 2. NIGHT \nThe freeze-frame of the glass in mid-air and Begbie's smiling face. \nRENTON (v.o) \nYeah, the guy's a psycho, but it's true, he's a mate as well, so what can you do? Just stand back and watch and try not to get involved. Begbie didn't do drugs either, he just did people. That what he got off on: his own sensory addiction. \nThe glass falls into the crowd. \nScreaming starts. A Woman is bleeding from a wound in her head. The Men beside her turn furiously around to look for the source of the glass. \nUp on the balcony, Begbie stands up. The screams and shouting continue below. \nBegbie appears at the bottom of the staircase down from the balcony. \nHe strides towards the bleeding Woman and begins shouting. \n", "test1_true": "All right. Nobody move. The girl got glassed and no cunt leaves here until we find out which cunt did it. \nA man stands up from one of the tables. \nMAN \nAnd who the fuck do you think you are? \nBegbie kick the Man in the groin. Another moves towards him but is blocked by the Men surrounding the girl. Soon the whole mass dissolves into a brutal scrum, in which Begbie plays a prominent part. \nUp on the balcony, the rest of the gang watch in silence. \nINT. RENTON'S FLAT. DAY \nThe empty cover for 100 Great Goals lies on the floor. \nSick Boy and Renton sit dispassionately watching Tommy and Lizzy in their home-made soft-porn video. \nRENTON (v.o) \nAnd as I sat watching the intimate and highly personal video, stolen only hours earlier from one of my best friends, I realized that something important was missing from my life. \nINT. CLUB. NIGHT \nA mass of dancing bodies fills the floor. The music is very loud. \nAt the side of the dance floor sit Tommy and Spud. The look rather gloomy. There is an empty seat beside each of them. Spud is drinking heavily. \nTommy turns and speaks to Spud. His lips move but nothing is audible. Spud is not ever aware that Tommy has spoken. \nTommy bellows in Spud's ear. \nTommy's words and all subsequent conversation in the dance area of the club appear as subtitles, the character's communications somewhere between speech and mime. \nTOMMY \nHow's it going with Gail? \nSPUD \nNo joy yet. \nTOMMY \nHow long is it? \nSPUD \nSix weeks. \nTOMMY \nSix weeks! \nSPUD \nIt's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in. \nTOMMY \nWhere did she come up with that? \nSPUD \nShe read it in Cosmopolitan. \nTOMMY \nSix weeks and no sex? \nSPUD \nI've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you. \nINT.

DIANE I don't see why not. \nRENTON \nBecause it's illegal. \nDIANE \nHolding hands? \nRENTON \nNo, not holding hands. \nDIANE \nIn that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night. \nRENTON \nAnd that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet. \nThey stop at the school gates. DIANE \nCalm down. You're not going to jail. \nRENTON \nEasy for you to say. \nDIANE \nCan I see you again? \nRENTON \nCertainly not. \nRenton walks away. DIANE \nIf you don't see me again I'll tell the police. \nRenton turns and walks back to her. They stand for a moment, then Renton walks away again. Diane smiles.

DAY \nA train speeds across. \nINT. TRAIN. DAY \nSick Boy, Tommy, Spud and Renton sit drinking from an extensive carry-out. SICK BOY \nThis had better be good. \nTOMMY \nIt will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack. \nSICK BOY \nIf I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing. \nTOMMY \n", "test2_true": "SICK BOY \nSuch as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question? \nThey sit in silence. \nEXT. STATION. DAY \nThe station is in the middle of a moor. There appears to be no habitation around. In the distance are some hills. \nThe train stands at the station. \nAs it pulls away, Renton, Spud, Tommy and Sick Boy are left standing on the platform, looking around. SICK BOY \nNow what? \nTOMMY \nWe go for a walk. \nSPUD \nWhat? \nTOMMY \nA walk. \nSPUD \nBut where? \nTommy points vaguely across the moor. TOMMY \nThere. \nSICK BOY \nAre you serious? \nThey step across the tracks toward the vast moorland. They stop. All but Tommy sit down on rocks or clumps of heather. TOMMY \nWell, what are you waiting for? \nSPUD \nI don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal. \nA group of three serious Walkers trudge past from the other end of the platform, decked out in regulation Berghaus from head to foot. They tramp off towards the wilderness. The boys watch them go. Spud opens a can. TOMMY \nIt's the great outdoors. \nSICK BOY \nIt's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now? \nTOMMY \nIt's fresh air. \nSICK BOY \nLook, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us. \nTOMMY \nDoesn't it make you proud to be Scottish? \nRENTON \nI hate being Scottish. We're the lowest of the fucking low, the scum of the earth, the most wretched, servile, miserable, pathetic trash that was ever shat into civilization. Some people hate the English, but I don't. They're just wankers. We, on the other hand, are colonized by wankers. We can't even pick a decent culture to be colonized by. We are ruled by effete arseholes. It's a shite state of affairs and all the fresh air in the world will not make any fucking difference. \nThe three serious Walkers are receding into the distance. The boys troop back towards the platform. (v.o) At or around this time, we made a healthy, informed, democratic decision to get \nback on drugs as soon as possible. It took about twelve hours. \nINT.

Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse. \nRENTON \nYou're all hear. \nSICK BOY \nI know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'

Revealing more, he is in a scruffy, cramped office with half a dozen occupied desks and twice as many telephones. Seated at the one nearest to the belching Man is Renton. He is wearing a shirt and tie now. He turns in response to the belch. MAN \nCan you take this call? \nRenton takes the telephone and reaches for a piece of paper from which he reads. RENTON \nHello, yes, certainly. It's a beautifully converted Victorian town house. Ideally located in a quiet road near to local shops and transport. \nRenton checks his watch. \nEXT. THE AI IN NORTH LONDON. DAY \nRenton stands waiting beside this busy London road, outside some very unfortunate housing, as the traffic streams past. RENTON (v.o) \nTwo bedrooms and a kitchen/diner. Fully fitted in excellent decorative order. Lots of storage space. All mod cons. Three hundred and twenty pounds per week. \nA couple approach. Renton unlocks the door of a flat and holds the door open while he ushers them in. \nINT. LONDON FLAT. DAY \nRenton shows the Couple round a typical London flat nightmare. A poor conversion, poor decor, everything small and ill-fitting. The windows rattle as the traffic roars by. RENTON (v.o) \nI settled in not too badly and I kept myself to myself. Sometimes, of course, I thought about the guys, but mainly I didn't miss them at all. After all, this was boom town where any fool could make cash from chaos and plenty did. I quite enjoyed the sound of it all. Profit, loss, margins, takeovers, lending, letting, subletting, subdividing, cheating, scamming, fragmenting, breaking away. There was no such thing as society and even if there was, I most certainly had nothing to do with it. For the first time in my adult life I was almost content. \nINT. LONDON BEDSIT.

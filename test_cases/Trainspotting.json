{"test1_input": "Well, at least we knew who the father was now. It wasn't just the baby that died that day. Something inside Sick Boy was lost and never returned. It seemed he had no theory with which to explain a moment like this. \nINT. SHOP. DAY \nRenton, Spud and Sick Boy are stuffing their pockets, as seen before. Renton's theft is interrupted by Diane's voice. DIANE \nHello there, Mark. \nDiane is standing just beside him. \nWhat are you doing? \nRenton is speechless, but a few stolen items fall from inside his jacket down to the floor. Diane looks down. Spud and Sick Boy start to snigger. One of the Store Detectives become aware of the group. He starts walking towards them. \nYou didn't tell me you were a thief. \nSPUD \nHey, go easy, lady. The boy's got a habit to support. \nSICK BOY \nOpium doesn't just grow on trees, you know. \nA few more items fall from Renton's jacket as the store Detective closes in. Renton looks at Diane. \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nRenton and Spud are running, pursued by the Two Store Detectives. RENTON (v.o) Nor did I. Our only response was to keep on going and fuck everything. Pile misery upon misery, heap it up on a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile, then squirt it into a stinking purulent vein and do it all over again. Keep on going: getting up, going out, robbing, stealing, fucking people over, propelling ourselves with longing towards the day it would all go wrong. As seen in the opening scene, Renton is nearly hit by a car that screeches to a halt as he crosses a road. He looks at the driver, at Spud running away and the Store Detectives approaching. (v.o) Because no matter how much you stash or how much you steal, you never have enough. No matter how often you go out and rob and fuck people over you always need to get up and do it all again. Renton smiles and waits. (v.o) Sooner or later, this sort of thing was bound to happen. One of the Detectives runs straight past him, after Spud. The other Detective crashes into Renton with a mighty punch in the stomach. \nINT. COURT. DAY \nSpud and Renton stand in the dock. Renton's Mother and Father, Sick Boy, Begbie, and Spud's Mother (Mrs. Murphy) are among those in the gallery. The Sheriff delivers his sentence. SHERIFF \n...because shoplifting is theft, which is a crime, and, despite what you may believe, there is no such entity as victimless crime. Heroin addiction may explain your actions, but it does not excuse them. Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of regret or remorse. In sentencing you to six months' imprisonment my only worry is that it will not be long before we meet again. Mr Renton, I understand that you have entered into a programme of rehabilation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin. The suspension of your sentence is conditional upon your continued cooperation with this programme. Should you stand guilty before me again, I shall not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence. \nRENTON \nThank you, your honour. With God's help, I'll conquer this affliction. \nThe Sheriff and Renton stare at one another for a moment. Renton turns to look at Spud, then back towards the Sheriff, who is now leaving the court. (v.o) \nWhat can you say? Well, Begbie had a phrase for it. \nINT. PUB I. DAY \nThe pub is crowded. Around Renton are his mother, Father, Begbie, Sick Boy and Gav. BEGBIE \nIt was fucking obvious that that cunt was going to fuck some cunt. \nThere is a round to nodding and 'poor Spud'ing. Everyone begins to talk at once. FATHER \nI hope you've learned your lesson, son. \nMOTHER \nOh, my son, I thought I was going to lose you there. You're nothing but trouble to me, but I still love you. \nBEGBIE \nClean up your act, sunshine. Cut that shite out for ever. \nMOTHER \nYou listen to Francis, Mark, he's talking sense. \nBEGBIE \nFucking right I am. See, inside, you wouldn't last two fucking days. \nSICK BOY \nThere's better things that the needle, Rents. Choose life. \nHe winks. MOTHER \nI remember when you were a baby, even when you would never do what you were told. \nBEGBIE \n", "test1_true": "They laugh, then fall silent. Renton turns around. Behind him stands Spud's mother. RENTON \nMrs Murphy, I'm sorry about Spud. It's wasn't fair, him going down and not me -- \nTears in her eyes, Mrs Murphy turns and walks away. Renton watches her go. Behind him Begbie shouts. BEGBIE \nIt's no our fault. Your boy went down because he was fucking smack-head and if that's not your fault, I don't know what is. \nBegbie turns back to Renton. \nRight. I'll get the drinks in. \nHe moves towards the bar. Renton slips away. Renton walks through the bar towards the toilets, then out of a back door. \nEXT. YARD. DAY \nRenton emerges into a narrow yard surrounded by a high wall. He looks around. The steel back gate is locked. RENTON (v.o) \nI wished I had gone down instead of Spud. Here I was surrounded by my family and my so-called mates and I've never felt so alone, never in all my puff. Since I was on remand they've had me on this programme, the state-sponsored addiction, three sickly sweet doses of methadone a day instead of smack. But it's never enough, and at the moment it's nowhere near enough. I took all three this morning and now I've got eighteen hours to go till my next shot and a sweat on my back like a layer of frost. I need to visit the mother superior for one hit, one fucking hit to get us over this long, hard day. \nRenton climbs the wall. He stands on top, then dives off the other side, executing a somersault in mid-air. \nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. NIGHT \nSwanney is cooking up. Renton lands on the floor behind him like a gymnast. RENTON \nWhat's on the menu this evening? \nSWANNEY \nYour favourite dish. \nRENTON \nExcellent. \nSWANNEY \nYour usual table, sir? \nRENTON \nWhy, thank you. \nRenton sits on his usual cushion on the floor. SWANNEY \nAnd would sir care to settle his bill in advance? \nRENTON \nStick it on my tab. \nSWANNEY \nRegret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago. \nRENTON \nIn that case -- \nHe produces twenty pounds. SWANNEY \nOh, hard currency, why, sir, that'll do nicely. \nHe swipes the notes underneath a UV forgery checker. \nCan't be too careful when we're dealing with your type, can we? \nRenton begins his search for a vein. \nWould sir care for a starter? Some garlic bread perhaps? \nRENTON \nNo, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please. \nSWANNEY \nAs you wish. \n", "test1_id": 741, "test2_input": "RENTON \nI can't believe you did that. \nSICK BOY \nI got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money. \nRENTON \nIt was my fucking television. \nSICK BOY \nWell, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that? \nHe takes Renton's fish supper and adds it to his own. \nHave you got a passport? \nRENTON \nWhy? \nSICK BOY \nWell, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price. \nRENTON \nWhy would I want to sell my passport? \nSICK BOY \nIt was just an idea. \nINT. LEFT LUGGAGE ROOM. DAY \nRenton drops his passport into an envelope and throws the envelope into a locker. He turns the key and pockets it. RENTON (v.o) \nI had to get rid of them. Sick Boy didn't do his drug deal and he didn't get rich. Instead, he and Begbie just hung around my bedsit looking for things to steal. I decided to put them in the worst place in the world. \nEXT. BUSY LONDON ROAD. DAY \nTraffic floods past as before. \nINT. LONDON FLAT. DAY \nInside the flat that Renton showed the couple around. Sick Boy and Begbie are standing in the hallway. Renton is in the open doorway. He throws them the keys and leaves. \nINT. LONDON BEDSIT. NIGHT \nThe cramped bedsit is a mess, filled with litter and unwashed clothes. Renton lies on his bed, content to be alone. \nINT. LONDON FLAT. NIGHT \nThe flat is in darkness. The door opens a figure enters. It is the man from Renton's office. RENTON (v.o) \nBut, of course, they weren't paying any rent, so when my boss found two desperate suckers who would, Sick Boy and Begbie were bound to feel threatened. \nMan is followed by another couple. He switches on a light. MAN \nAs you can see, it's a beautiful conversion. Two bedrooms, kitchen/diner. Fully fitted. Lots of storage. All mod cons. Three hundred and twenty quid a week. \nFrom nowhere, Begbie and Sick Boy spring out at him. \nINT. BEDSIT. DAY \nRenton looks around the stripped, empty bedsit one last time before closing the door as he leaves. \nRENTON (v.o) \nAnd that was that. But by then we had another reason to go back. Tommy. \nEXT. RAILWAY. DAY \nAn InterCity train speeds by. \nINT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gon full-blown. \nRENTON (v.o) \nWhat was it, pneumonia or cancer? \nGAV (v.o) \nNo, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke. \nRENTON (v.o) \nEh? How's that? \nINT. CREMATORIUM CHAPEL. DAY \nA service is in progress. Those present include Renton and Gav, who are engaged in hushed conversation, Begbie, Spud, Sick Boy, and Lizzy. GAV \nHe wanted to see Lizzy again. \nHe indicated Lizzy. Lizzy wouldn't let him near the house. So he brought a present for her, brought her a kitten. RENTON \nI bet Lizzy told him where to put it. \nGAV \nExactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit. \nRENTON \nI didn't either. What the fuck is it? \nINT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY \nThe kitten as before. Slow track back to reveal more. GAV (v.o) \nHe starts getting headaches, so he just uses more smack, for the pain, like. There he has a stroke. A fucking stroke. Just like that. God home from hospital and died about three weeks later. Been dead for ages before the neighbours complained about the smell and the police broke the door down. Tommy was lying face down in a pool of vomit. \nThe lower half of Tommy's clothed body is visible. \nINT. CREMATORIUM CHAPEL. DAY \nThe coffin travels away. Gav and Renton watch it go. GAV \nThe kitten was fine. \nINT. PUB I. NIGHT \nGav, Renton, Spud, Sick Boy, Begbie and a few others are gathered in the pub, still dressed in their funeral garb. \nSPUD \nEvery time I think of Tommy I think of Australian, because every time I went round he was just lying there, junked out of his mind, watching Aussie soaps. Until he sold the telly, of course, then he was just lying there. Buy every time I think of him, I still think of Australia. \nThere is a short silence before Spud begins softly singing 'Two Little Boys'. He finishes unaccompanied. \nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. NIGHT \nSpud, Begbie, and Renton are seated. Sick Boy is handing around bottles of beer before he too sits down. They are all wearing their funeral garb. Renton raises his bottle. RENTON \nTommy. \nThey all drink. SICK BOY \nDid you tell him? \nBEGBIE \nNo. On you go. \nRENTON \nWhat? \nSICK BOY \nThere's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear. \nRENTON \n", "test2_id": 742, "test3_input": "Renton cooks up in the bus toilet. RENTON (v.o) \nThis was to be my final hit. But let's be clear about this: there's final hits and final hits. What kind was this to be? {----------Some final hits are actually terminal one way or another, while others are merely transit points as you travel from station to station on the junky journey through junky life. \nINT. BUS. NIGHT \nBegbie sits grimly. The others are relaxed. RENTON (v.o) \nThis was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton. \nBEGBIE \nDid you bring the cards? \nSICK BOY \nWhat? \nBEGBIE \nThe cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards. \nSICK BOY \nWell, I've not brought them. \nBEGBIE \nIt's fucking boring after a while without the cards. \nSICK BOY \nWell, I've not brought them. \nBEGBIE \nIt's fucking boring after a while without the cards. \nSICK BOY \nI'm sorry. \nBEGBIE \nBit fucking late, like. \nSICK BOY \nWell, why didn't you bring them? \nBEGBIE \nBecause I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt. \nSICK BOY \nChrist. \nEXT. LONDON. DAY \nThe bus travels through London. \nEXT. STREET. DAY \nThe gang enter a cheap hotel. Begbie's bag contains the heroin. \nINT. HOTEL. DAY \nThey are met by Andreas, a man in his late thirties of Mediterranean appearance. He shakes Sick Boy's hand. ANDREAS \nThese are your friends? \nSICK BOY \nThese are the guys I told you about. \nANDREAS \nOK. \n", "test3_true": "Is he here? \nANDREAS \nYes, he's here. I hope you didn't get followed or nothing. \nBEGBIE \nWe didn't get followed. \nAndreas leads them along a corridor and into a room. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY \nAn exceptional Man is waiting. Andreas leaves the room and closes the door. The Man opens both and tastes the heroin. He produces a set of kitchen scales from his bag and weighs the two bags. RENTON (v.o) \nStraight away he clocked us from what we were: small-time wasters with an accidental big deal. \nMAN \nSo what do you want for it? \nBEGBIE \nTwenty thousand. \nMAN \nBut it's not worth more than fifteen. \nBEGBIE \nNinteen. \nThe man shakes his head and lights a cigarette. MAN \nNineteen I can't offer you, I'm sorry. \nRENTON (v.o) \nThis was a real drag to him. He didn't need to negotiate. I mean, what the fuck were we going to do if he didn't buy it? Sell it on the streets. Fuck that. \nThe deal is done. The Man hands over the money and waits as it is counted, then leaves with the drugs. (v.o) \nWe settled on sixteen thousand pounds. He had a lot more in the suitcase, but it was better than nothing. And just for a moment it felt really great, like we were all in it together, like friends, like it meant something. A moment like that, it can touch you deep inside, but it doesn't last long, not like sixteen thousand pounds. \nINT. LONDON PUB. DAY \nThe pub is crowded with afternoon drinkers. Renton, Spud, Sick Boy and Begbie sit drinking. Begbie is still keeping a firm hand on the sports bag, which now holds the money. SICK BOY \nSo what are you planning with your share, Spud? \nRENTON \nBuy yourself that island in the sun? \nBEGBIE \nFor four fucking grand? One plam tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow. \nSPUD \nI don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly. \nBEGBIE \nShag her senseless. \nSPUD \nNo, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all -- \nBEGBIE \nYou daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in. \nSICK BOY \nI got a round already. \n", "test3_id": 743}

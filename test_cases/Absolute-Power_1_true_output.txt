Luther.   Now he's surprised.    He kind of smiles. 
LUTHER You want me to help solve your case?

SETH Just looking   for insight. How would you --   scratch that -- how would one go   about it? What kind of person do   you think I should be looking for? 
LUTHER (like a shot) Older fella. Like me. 
SETH (now he smiles) Because? 
LUTHER Need patience. The secret is just research, research, research -- from everything I've read. 
Seth. This hasn't gone at all the way he thought -- and he's starting to get fascinated. 
SETH Research for what? 
LUTHER Well, from what I can tell on the tube, it's not a small house. (as Seth nods) There had to be an architect, right? You'd be able to tell which one from public records in the library. And once you know the office, you could break in and find the plans and Xerox them, get them back before morning. 
SETH Not just steal them? 
LUTHER Seth -- breaking in isn't hard -- what's hard is breaking in so no one knows you've been there. Now, after the architect, next you'd want the contractor's office -- and the security company's office. (beat) You know the skill involved breaking the security of a security company? (shakes his head) I wonder how those guys do it?

SETH Why go to all that trouble? 
LUTHER Papers said he kept the money in a vault, yes? (as Seth nods) Well, I'm guessing there was probably some secret way to open it -- 
SETH (casually) -- clicker -- 
LUTHER (fascinated) -- explain -- 
SETH -- gizmo -- looked like a V.C.R. remote -- 
LUTHER (shaking his head) -- amazing -- (beat) -- must have been a lot of money inside. 
SETH (sipping casually; a pause) Five million. 
And on those words -- 
Luther, more than he thought, a lot more -- but of course nothing shows -- instead he breaks out laughing. 
SETH Why's that funny? 
LUTHER The way you said it -- as if you were trying to surprise me. 
SETH (smiles) I was trying to surprise you. 
LUTHER (smiles back) There you go.

Seth sips his coffee, takes out his notebook, opens it. 
SETH Would the burglar use a disguise? 
LUTHER Seth, you've got to get with the program you expect to catch this guy -- most likely it is a guy, am I right? Some kind of weird loner? 
SETH Maybe like you. 
LUTHER (couldn't agree more) I'm the perfect prototype. (sipping away) But you see any face often enough, you'll start putting things together. That's why these top guys disguise themselves. I read a great article a couple of years back -- damn, I wish I could remember where -- anyway, it was about these makeup experts some of them use -- wigmakers, people like that. 
SETH (flipping a page) Go on about the wigmakers. 
LUTHER (glancing at his watch) I'd love that but I'm late as it is -- got to get my pacemaker checked. (he likes Seth) -- all this excitement, you understand. 
SETH (and he likes Luther) A) You don't have a pacemaker, and B) I'll be back tomorrow. 
LUTHER Tomorrow is promised to no one. 
HOLD ON Luther. 
169   INT. LUTHER'S SMALL HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                    169 
Luther is throwing clothes into a suitcase while talking on the phone -- 
LUTHER Not 'til morning? (makes a face) -- I'll be by early -- 
He hangs up, shuts the suitcase, takes off out the door -- 
170   INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  170 
A place we've seen briefly before.   Dark.   Moonlight through the windows. 
The sound of a KEY IN the DOOR. 
Luther enters, takes out a tiny flashlight. We're in one largish room, books all over. The home of someone who doesn't care a whole lot about their home. 
171   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                           171 
Luther enters. He opens the fridge. Disaster -- still water, sparkling water, carrot sticks. 
LUTHER (sadly, muttering) Katie darling, you've gotta try real food sometime. 
He closes the door, moves back into the room -- 
172   INT. KATE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  172 
A graduation photo of Kate. Luther touches it with a fingertip, moves on through the silence.

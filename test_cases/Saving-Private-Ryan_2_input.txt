REIBEN AND UPHAM repeatedly glance back at Wade. 
SARGE Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder. 
MILLER About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal. 
MILLER Damn it! 
Throws the sulfa aside.  Quickly pulls out a morphine pack. 
SARGE Fumbles with a second sulfa bag. 
SARGE Sulfa, more sulfa... 
WADE Frozen in agony.  Looks at Miller. Sees him preparing the morphine shot. They both know. 
WADE Yeah...morphine...make it a double...huh...Captain...? 
MILLER SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge. 
MILLER More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on... 
SARGE Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine. 
MILLER Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before. 
REIBEN On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off. 
REIBEN Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it... 
UPHAM Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't. 
JACKSON Watching. 
MILLER Gives Wade the second shot. 
WADE Feels the effects of the first shot. He sees Upham and manages a pained smile. 
WADE LOCKS EYES WITH MILLER.  Looking at him without blame, without forgiveness.  Drifts with the morphine.  Then: WADE DIES 
ALL ARE FROZEN IN PLACE 
UPHAM begins to weep. 
REIBEN FURIOUSLY MUTTERS: 
REIBEN Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it... 
MILLER Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices. 
Miller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men see.  He picks up the dogtag and pockets it. 
Then Miller carefully re-packs the un-used morphine and sulfa, rises and picks up his Thompson. 
Upham shakes his head. 
UPHAM That was no twenty-two flat. 
Miller SLAMS A FRESH CLIP into his Thompson. 
MILLER He lied.  Let's move out. 
Miller turns and walks away without looking back.  The men hesitate, then slowly follow him. 
EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY COW PATH - DAY 
A narrow footpath, arched over by trees, almost a tunnel. The five G.I.'s walk, spread out. 
REIBEN Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch. 
JACKSON Shut up, will you? 
REIBEN You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard. 
JACKSON Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade. 
REIBEN The hell he didn't. 
Miller motions to them curtly. 
MILLER Keep it down. 
They shut up.  Miller falls in step to Sarge.  Speaks quietly, the men don't hear.

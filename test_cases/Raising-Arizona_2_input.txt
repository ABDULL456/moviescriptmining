GALE Well ma'am... we sure didn't mean to influence anyone. 
EVELLE And if we did, we apologize. 
Ed is unmoved. 
ED I'm goin' in to town tomorrow to see about some shots for the baby. When I come back you better be gone or I'll kick you out myself. 
She storms into the bedroom and slams the door. 
There is an awkward silence as Gale studies his thumb and Evelle stares at the ceiling. Finally Evelle turns to Hi. 
EVELLE ...What's he need, his dip-tet? 
HI I'm awful sorry boys, but when Ed gets mad, you know, when she gets an idea... 
GALE Well there ain't a thing to apologize for, H.I... 
He looks at Evelle. 
GALE ...It seems pretty clear what the situation is here. 
EVELLE Yeah, I guess the Missus wants us to clear out. 
GALE Now H.I., you'll pardon me for sayin' so, but I get the feelin' that this- here... 
His gesture seems to take in the trailer and the entire domestic situation. 
GALE ...ain't exactly workin' out. 
HI Well now Ed's generally a real sweetheart, I- 
GALE And as per usual, I wouldn't be surprised if the source of the marital friction was financial. 
HI Well, matter of fact, I did lose my job today- 
EVELLE Come on Hi. you're young, you got your health - what do you want with a job? 
GALE But look, I'd rather light a candle than curse your darkness. As you know, Evelle'n I never go anywhere without a reason... and here we are in your little domicile. We come to invite you in on a score. 
EVELLE A bank, Hi. 
Hi is shaking his head. 
HI Aw boys, I don't- 
GALE I know you're partial to convenience stores but, H.I., the sun don't rise and set on the corner grocery. 
EVELLE It's like Doc Schwartz says: You gotta have a little ambition. Why we just heard on the news how somebody snatched off one of the Arizona babies. Now there's someone thinkin' big. 
GALE And here you are sittin' around on your butt playin' house with a - don't get me wrong, H.I., with a fine woman - but a woman who needs the button-down type. 
HI Well now that ain't really any of your- 
GALE Just lookahere... 
He is handing Hi a folded-up picture. 
EVELLE Picture of El Dorado, Hi. 
GALE Though the locals call it the Farmers and Mechanics Bank of LaGrange. Looks like a hayseed bank and, tell you the truth, it is a hayseed bank. Except the last Friday of every financial quarter there's more cash in that bank than flies at a barbecue. 
EVELLE And guess what day it is tomorrow? 
GALE Ya see, H.I., it's when the hayseeds come in to cash their farm subsidy checks. 
EVELLE A-One information. 
GALE Got it in the joint from a guy named Lawrence Spivey, one of Dick Nixon's undersecretaries of agriculture. 
EVELLE He's in for solicitin' sex from a state trooper. 
GALE Ordinarily we don't associate with that class of person, but... 
Gale chuckles. 
GALE ...he was tryin' to make brownie points with some of the boys. 
HI Boys, I can't - 
EVIELLE We need someone handy with a scatter- gun to cover the hayseeds while we get the cash. 
GALE Y'understand, H.I., if this works out it's just the beginning of a spree across the entire Southwest proper. We keep goin' 'till we can retire - or we get caught. 
EVELLE Either way we're fixed for life. 
Hi is still shaking his head. 
HI Boys, it's a kind offer, but you're suggesting I just up'n leave Ed. Now that'd be pretty damn cowardly, wouldn't it. 
GALE Would it?  Think about it, H.I. Seems to me, stayin' here, y'ain't doin' her any good. And y'ain't bein' true to your own nature. 
The camera has floated in to a close shot of Hi, staring glumly at GALE. 
TRACKING ON MOTORCYCLE NIGHT 
Following it, very close, we see only its rear wheel and fender and twin exhaust pipes, one on either side. Flame is boiling in each exhaust pipe as the hog roars. 
HIGHER TRACKING SHOT 
From behind the Biker's head as he rides through the night. With the sharp whipcrack effect he suddenly looks left, searching. With a second whipcrack effect he suddenly looks right, still searching. 
He banks into a turn.

be joined in love. But now that I am bathed in the radiance of your glory, I am overwhelmed. I am 
conquered. I die. Only your love, great Elizabeth, can restore me to life. C ourtiers exchange smiles at his efforts. The Spaniards sneer openly. But Elizabeth takes the charade with due gravity. 
LIZABETH Your highness does me great honour. Shall we eat our dinner? It should prove almost as restorative as my love. 
Raleigh enters the Great Hall, trailed by Calley, as the dinner gets under way. They join the much larger group who simply stand and watch. Royal meals are in part a spectacle for the court. A JESTER moves from group to group, playing pranks on the guests.

Raleigh is now dressed in court fashion, and looks very well; as the glances of several court ladies show. He catches Bess's eye and they share a smile. 
COURT LADY So tell me, Mr Raleigh, in your sea battles - how do you sink an enemy ship? You shoot holes in its sides, I suppose. 
May 1 Blue Draft - p.30 
RALEIGH No, ma'am. A sunk ship is of no value. The object is to capture and command. 
COURT LADY And how do you do that? 
RALEIGH Surprise. Speed. Irresistible violence. 
Calley, listening, rolls his eyes. 
Elizabeth, at the table with the Archduke by her side, glances towards Raleigh, and sees him flirting with the court ladies. Then back to the young Archduke, who has hardly touched his food. 
ELIZABETH I think you're not as accustomed as I am to eating in public. I have a secret. lowering her voice) I pretend there's a pane of glass - eine Glasscheibe - between me and them. S he moves one hand before her face, indicating an imaginary pane of glass. As she looks, she sees Bess staring at someone - follows her gaze - and is amused to find that the object of her attention is also Raleigh. 
ELIZABETH They can see me, but they can't hear me, or touch me. You should try it. 
She beckons to Bess. 
ELIZABETH Bess. 
Bess comes forward. 
ELIZABETH (low) He interests me. Talk to him. 
BESS Him, my lady? 
ELIZABETH Him. 
Bess turns and looks across towards Raleigh, as he flirts with the court ladies.

Elizabeth turns back to her guest. 
ELIZABETH His highness is tired after his journey. 
The young Archduke, frozen with shyness, sits staring before him, trembling as he frames a proper reply. 
ARCHDUKE CHARLES No man can be tired in the presence of so lovely a Queen. E lizabeth speaks so only he can hear, in German. 
ELIZABETH (You play the game very well, my young friend. But don't you 
sometimes feel an overwhelming desire to say what you're really thinking?) The Archduke's eyes open very wide. He glances at Elizabeth, and sees on her face a conspiratorial smile. 
ARCHDUKE CHARLES (I daren't even think what I'm really thinking.) ELIZABETH (You're thinking, perhaps, that 
you would far rather be home.) 
ARCHDUKE CHARLES (You're very wise, madame.) 
He's grateful to her, and his shy face shows it. 
Raleigh is still being entertained by the court ladies. COURT LADY I adore the natives you brought back with you. I don't suppose you could get one for me? They're not dangerous, are they? RALEIGH That depends what you propose to do with them. COURT LADY I'd dress him up in mulberry- coloured silk and have him walk behind me, carrying my cloak.

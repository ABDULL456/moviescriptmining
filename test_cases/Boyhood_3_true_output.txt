COLLEGE GIRL Is that your dad? 
MASON Yeah. 
COLLEGE GIRL Where's he live? 
MASON In Houston. 
COLLEGE GIRL Get to see him much? 
MASON Yeah, yeah.    Some weekends, and over the summer. 
COLLEGE GIRL Cool. 
MASON So you're a student of my mom's, right? 
COLLEGE GIRL Mm-hm. Yeah, she's uh, I got one class with her. Yeah, she's cool. 
MASON How's she doing? You know, is she -- is she a good teacher and everything? 
COLLEGE GIRL Yeah! She's great. She's super smart and she cares, you know, she makes it interesting. She's probably even my favorite teacher. 
Mason nods. 
INT. DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER 
One of Mom's students, JIM, tells a story while the group sits around the table eating. 
JIM ...So anyway, we figured out a way to rig up our iPods to the external speakers on the ASV. So every time we come rolling into town, you knew the 456 was there, 'cause we were bumping House of Pain. It was like, "Jump around, Jump around." And the whole family's coming outside, and you got the kids and the mom and the dad, and they're all bouncing up and down. We're throwing out candies for the kids, and soccer balls, and Beanie Babies, and Frisbees... Um, like, smokes for the adults. And they loved, they absolutely loved, Gatorade. But for some reason, you know, they hated the lemon-lime flavor. I don't know what it was. Yeah. Couldn't give it away. 
The group laughs. 
MOM How long were you over there? 
JIM Uhh... I did two tours in Iraq and one in Bosnia. 
MOM Wow. 
MASON Did you enlist? 
JIM Mm-hmm. Yeah. I was, um, Army National Guard. And, uh, you know coming straight out of high school. Needed money for college. Seemed like a decent paying job. And, uh, did my tour. And whenever I got done, I told them if there's, you know, a world-changing event, I'll come back. And, uh, 3 months later 9/11 happened. And I was back 9/12. And I'm proud to say the 456, the whole time we were there, we never lost a guy. Not one casualty. 
MOM But is that odd?    Is that unusual? 
JIM Yeah. Almost impossible. Like the guys that came along after us and replaced us, they didn't listen to any of our advice. They, you know, did basically the polar opposite of what we did, and they lost seven guys in the first month. 
MOM Wow. What did you guys do differently? 
JIM Well, I'd like to think it's just a matter of mutual respect, you know. I mean, all the time we spent over there building trust, I mean these guys basically destroyed it in three days. 
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS So, what did the locals think about why we were there? 
JIM Oil.    Plain and simple. 
INT.   LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The College Girl is now playing guitar and singing "Wish You Were Here" along with others in the living room. At some point, Mason notices Mom talking with Jim outside on the porch. 
EXT. CAR - NIGHT 
A station wagon pulls up in front of Mason's house. The teenagers inside are listening to music, about to drop Mason off at home. 
INT.   CAR - NIGHT 
Mason is in the far back of the station wagon, making out with a BLONDE GIRL. 
CHASE Hey, Mason. (hands Mason a joint) One last hit. 
Mason takes a hit of the joint. 
CHARLIE (in the driver's seat) Hey! Mickey Mouse Club. Get the fuck out of my car. Just crawl out the back window or something, man. 
Mason climbs out the back window of the station wagon. 
BLONDE GIRL I'm gonna miss you. 
MASON I'll see you on Sunday night. 
BLONDE GIRL Alright.    You better text me. 
MASON Mm.    Do you have any gum? 
BLONDE GIRL Um... yeah, I do, actually.   Here you go. 
MASON Thanks.   See ya. 
Mason kisses her good-night. 
INT.   JIM'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Mom is hosting a small get-together, and is currently talking with Professor Douglas. 
MOM ...And they're buying this party line that they're supposed to feel bad and trade off their own pension, as if that's what's corrupting this nation. 
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS Yeah, because those who hear Fox, in my opinion, are being lied to. 
MOM Yeah, thank God for Wisconsin. I mean, we have to follow that example. 
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS You're right. 
Mason enters the front door. 
JIM Hey, Mason.    What time is it? 
MASON Uh, like 12:15. 
JIM Happy birthday. 
Mason smiles. 
MOM Huh!   Happy birthday! 
Mom kisses Mason. Professor Douglas walks over to join them, taking an interest. 
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS Mason, it's your birthday? 
MASON Uh, just now, I guess. 
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS Yeah, how old are you? 
MASON Fifteen. 
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS Fifteen!    Give me a hug. 
Professor Douglas hugs Mason. 
PROFESSOR DOUGLAS (CONT'D) Happy birthday. Oh my goodness! 
Professor Douglas rejoins the party. 
MOM (to Mason) Have you been drinking? 
MASON Have you?

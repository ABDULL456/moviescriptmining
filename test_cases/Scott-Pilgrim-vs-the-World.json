He looks back to the crowd to find the MYSTERY GEEK staring right at him. Then- Disorienting LIGHTS and LASERS flash on the opposite stage. A wall of FEEDBACK builds...THE KATAYANAGI TWINS appear, sliding onstage behind their respective keyboard stands. KYLE KATAYANAGI, 23, is very serious and Japanese. KEN KATAYANAGI, 23, is serious and very Japanese. Scott, Stephen Stills and Kim share a nervous look. \nSTEPHEN STILLS Okay gang. Can we do this? I mean, we can do this. Right? \nKIM PINE Right. \nSTEPHEN STILLS Scott? Scott is distracted again by the Mystery Geek staring at him. \nKIM PINE Scott! Kyle Katayanagi hits a SINGLE NOTE on the keyboard, blasting an enormous wave of sound at Sex Bob-Omb. It's so loud that it shakes the foundations and rips the lighting rig from the ceiling, leaving a huge hole in the roof. The crowd cheers. \nAUDIENCE DUDE (O.S.) They brought the house down.

He can't find Ramona, but comes upon KNIVES standing alone in her homemade Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt. \nKNIVES CHAU I just came to see the show. I'm not even stalking you. Knives's unusally composed demeanor gives Scott pause. \nSCOTT You seem... different. Knives shrugs, different. \nKNIVES CHAU I feel like I know stuff now. Scott and Knives lock eyes.

I can't be part of the band with this douche-in-charge. \nGIDEON GRAVES Scottie, buddy, can I just say, keep your emotions in check. Don't let what's past screw up your future. Scott watches Ramona get into the Continental. She rolls the mirrored window up so Scott stares at his own reflection. \nSTEPHEN STILLS The people need to hear us, Scott. \nSCOTT Then you're going to need to find someone else to play bass. A cough. A meek Young Neil slides into view, bass in hand. \nGIDEON Looks like we're all set. Young Neil signs the contract. There are hand shakes all round. Gideon turns to Scott and pats him on the shoulder. \nGIDEON Oh and Scott, we should really be thanking each other. I mean, if it wasn't for me, you would have never been with Ramona, but if it wasn't for you, she wouldn't be back with me. So I guess it all shakes out. Gideon walks around to the driver side of the Lincoln. \nGIDEON And hey, the whole League of Evil Exes thing? I was in a dark place when I put that together. Forgiven?

Gideon SWINGS his sword at Ramona. Knives whips off her scarf, uses it to wrap up Gideon's sword arm and disarms him. Scott and Knives punch Gideon in the face in a volley of \nFREEZE FRAMES. Knives KICKS Gideon in the stomach and Scott follows with a PUNCH IN THE NOSE, sending Gideon sliding across the floor. Gideon gets back to his feet via backflip.

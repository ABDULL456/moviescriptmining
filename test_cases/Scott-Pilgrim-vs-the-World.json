TEXT appears in an on-screen box: \n\"SCOTT PILGRIM, 22 YEARS OLD, RATING: AWESOME.\" Stars appear in Knives's eyes. Scott grins heroically. Scott winks at Knives. Scott winks at the camera. \nINTEGRATED FINAL 2A. \n4 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' KITCHEN - DAY 4 \nBack in the kitchen, everyone looks at Scott... \nKIM PINE Is that seriously the end of the story? \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 3. \n4 CONTINUED: 4 \nSCOTT Yes.

Stephen Stills comes to the door and peers through. \nSCOTT Yeaaaah... \n9 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 9 \nScott hangs his coat up in a tiny, one room apartment. He turns to WALLACE WELLS, dark hair, arched eyebrow, disloyal. \n\"WALLACE WELLS, ROOMMATE, 24 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: HE IS GAY!\" \nSCOTT Before you hear some dirty lies from someone else, yes, I'm dating a 17 year old. Wallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading. \nWALLACE Is he cute? \nSCOTT Ha, ha, ha, ha. \nWALLACE Does this mean we have to stop sleeping together? \nSCOTT Do you see another bed in here? TINY BOXES OF TEXT indicate the ownership of the items in the one room flat: 95% belongs to Wallace, FUTON included. \nWALLACE Yeah. You're totally my bitch forever. \nSCOTT So. The whole seventeen year old thing. Don't tell too many people. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 6A. \n9 CONTINUED: 9 \nWALLACE Hey, you know me. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 7. \n9 CONTINUED: (2) 9 \nSCOTT I mean.

Seventeen years old? Scandal! Intercut with STACEY PILGRIM, cute, peppy barista, gabbing on her cellphone in THE SECOND CUP.

Who told you? \nSTACEY Wallace. Duh. \nSCOTT That gossipy bitch. \nWALLACE (O.S.) You know me. Scott turns to see Wallace on a second cordless. \nSCOTT Wallace! Wallace clicks off. Scott sinks into an armchair. \nSTACEY Who is this mysterious child you date? \nSCOTT Her name is Knives. Knives Chau. \nSTACEY A seventeen year old Chinese schoolgirl? You're ridiculous. \nSCOTT It's a Catholic school too. \nSTACEY With the uniform and everything? \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 8. \n9 CONTINUED: (3) 9 \nSCOTT Yeah, the whole deal. \nSTACEY Oh my God, you haven't- \nSCOTT No no no. We haven't even held hands. I think she hugged me once. \nSTACEY Um, Scott. Why are you doing this? \nSCOTT I don't know...it's just nice, you know? It's just...simple. \nSTACEY It's been over a year since you got dumped by she-who-will-not-be-named. Scott glances down at the partially obscured NOW magazine, looking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad. \nSTACEY (CONT'D) So, are you legitimately moving on, or is this just you being insane? Scott looks at a strip of photobooth pictures: he smiles next to a hot redhead in happier times. \nSCOTT Can I get back to you on that? A SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly... \n10 EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - DAY 10 \nWallace and Scott stand outside a CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL. Uniformed boys and girls pour out. \nWALLACE I do not want to be here. At all. \nSCOTT This school has boys too. \nWALLACE I hate you.

They literally walk across the street to a small house. \nSCOTT Here you go. \nKNIVES CHAU Wow. \nSCOTT Yeah. Wow. Wind blows. The light snowfall turns into sand... \n16 EXT. THE DREAM DESERT - HOTTEST DAY 16 \n...Scott wanders alone through a barren land. He falls to his knees next to a lonely cactus. \nSCOTT Oh God...so...so alone. A MYSTERIOUS GIRL rollerblades across the shifting sands. She wears fishnets, an army jacket, skirt and goggles. Her pink hair is funky but cool. She is hotter than the desert sun. \nMYSTERIOUS GIRL You're not alone. You're just having some idiotic dream. \nSCOTT Does that mean we can make out? But she's gone... \n17 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - ? 17 \n...SCOTT WAKES UP, sitting up in the FUTON. \nSCOTT Oh God... Wallace wakes up to the left of Scott, rubbing his eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 13. \n17 CONTINUED: 17 \nWALLACE What is it, Scott? \nSCOTT I had this totally weird dream. \nOTHER VOICE Oh God. \nWALLACE What is it, Scott? A scruffy, goateed guy wakes right between Scott and Wallace: \n\"OTHER SCOTT, 22, WALLACE'S BOYFRIEND? FUN FACT: GUY CURIOUS\" \nOTHER SCOTT Can we skip the dreamtime? Color me not interested. \nSCOTT But there was this girl... \nWALLACE Girl? \nOTHER SCOTT Was this an Envy related dream? \nWALLACE We don't use the E-word in this house. \nSCOTT No, it wasn't her. It was somebody new... \nOTHER SCOTT Yay for that. Other Scott goes back to sleep. Wallace rubs his eyes. \nWALLACE Speaking of new, weren't you supposed to take your fake high school girlfriend to the library a half-hour ago? \nSCOTT What? It's like, six in the morning. Scott opens the bathroom door. Sunlight ignites the room. \nSCOTT (CONT'D) Arrrrgh! \nINTEGRATED FINAL 13A. \n18 INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY 18 \nKNIVES CHAU What's wrong? \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 14. \n18 CONTINUED: 18 Scott is noticeably taller than all the teens in the library. He carries a stack of books for Knives. \nSCOTT Libraries remind me of grade school. \nKNIVES CHAU That must seem like a reeeeally long time ago. \nSCOTT Uh. Let's talk about something else. The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention. He freezes as he sees THE ROLLERBLADING GIRL FROM HIS DREAM skating towards the desk in SEXALICIOUS SLOW MOTION. \nKNIVES CHAU Do you know that girl? The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from AMAZON.CA to the librarian. Scott's gaze follows the GIRL as she blades out of the library. Pensive guitar underscores his thoughts. \nKNIVES CHAU Scott? Scott continues to stare at the girl. Time slows to a crawl. \nSTEPHEN STILLS (O.S.) \nSCOTT! \n19 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - EVENING 19 \nScott stands in the rehearsal room, head still in the clouds. \nSTEPHEN STILLS You only played one note for that entire song. \nSCOTT It was...uh...my hand slipped. \nKIM PINE Is your girlfriend distracting you? \nSCOTT My girlfriend? A meek Knives sits next to Young Neil on the couch. \nKNIVES CHAU I'll...

What do you know about Ramona Flowers? \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 18. \n22 CONTINUED: (3) 22 \nMONIQUE I think she has a boyfriend. \nSANDRA Some guy back in New York. \nMONIQUE Doesn't she have the most ridiculous name? \nSANDRA I know. It's so '\u009cRamona Quimby, Aged 8'\u009d and yet...Flowers. The girls laugh. Scott does not. \nSCOTT Yeah. What else? JUMP CUT through a FLURRY OF FACES as Scott asks everyone \nABOUT RAMONA: \nPARTYGOER #1 I heard she kicks all kind of ass. \nPARTYGOER #2 She's on another level. \nPARTYGOER #3 She's got men dying at her feet. \nPARTYGOER #4 She's got some battle scars. \nPARTYGOER #5 Not to be entered into lightly We end on the surly JULIE (the rude clerk) who steps in front of Scott, arms crossed. Stephen Stills is with her. \nJULIE What about Ramona Flowers? \nSCOTT You know her? Tell me. Now. \nJULIE She just moved here. Got a job with Amazon. Comes into my work. \nSCOTT Does she really? \nSTEPHEN STILLS Didn't you say she just broke up with someone, Jools? \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 18A. \n22 CONTINUED: (4) 22 \nSCOTT Did she reeally? \nSTEPHEN STILLS That they had a huge fight or whatever? \nSCOTT Did they reeeally? \nJULIE ...yes. But I didn't want Scott to know that, Stephen. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 19. \n22 CONTINUED: (5) 22 \nSCOTT Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl, she just- \nJULIE Scott, I forbid you from hitting on Ramona. Even if you haven't had a real girlfriend in over a year- \nSTEPHEN STILLS Hey whoa, whoa. Scott's mourning period is officially over. He's totally dating a high schooler. \nJULIE Dating a high schooler is the mourning period. \nSTEPHEN STILLS She's got a point. \nSCOTT I thought you guys broke up. \nJULIE I don't want you scaring off the coolest girl at my party Scott. We all know you're a total lady killer wannabe jerky jerk. \nSCOTT That's garbage! Completely untrue. \nJULIE That time with Lisa- \nRAMONA You have to leave. \n37 EXT. RAMONA'S APARTMENT - MORNING 37 \nRamona skates towards the front gate, Scott walking next to her. WAIST DEEP SNOW covers the roads and sidewalks. \nSCOTT Hey, can this not be a one night stand? For one thing, I didn't even get any...that was a joke. \nRAMONA What did you have in mind? \nSCOTT Umm...oh, come to the first round of this battle of the bands thing. \nRAMONA \n(TOTALLY UNIMPRESSED) You have a band? \nSCOTT Yeah, we're terrible.

Can I get your number? SSSSHHHOOP! Ramona skids to a stop, right back next to Scott. She hands him a note. '\u0098RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx'\u0098 \nSCOTT Wow, girl number. Scott looks back up. Ramona is already skating far, far away. \nRAMONA See you at the show, Scott Pilgrim. \nSCOTT Oh, hey! It's tonight...At The- \n38 INT. THE ROCKIT - NIGHT 38 \n'\u009cTHE ROCKIT, FUN FACT: THIS PLACE IS A TOILET'\u009d. Ramona wades through a grungy venue under the stare of young hipsters, reaching Scott at the bar. He stands with Wallace and Stacey. She holds hands with a guy wearing glasses. \nSCOTT You totally came! \nRAMONA Yes. I did totally come. Scott is so amazed at her presence, his social skills vanish. \nSTACEY Excuse my brother. He's chronically enfeebled. I'm Stacey. \nRAMONA Hey. \nSTACEY And this is Wallace, his room-mate. \nWALLACE Hey. \nSTACEY And this is my boyfriend Jimmy. \nWALLACE (staring at Jimmy) Heyyy. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 36. \n38 CONTINUED: 38 \nSTACEY And this is Knives, Scott's- Scott goes white. He didn't even see Knives come in. \nSCOTT \nHEYYYYYYYY! \nKNIVES CHAU Hey. Knives pecks Scott on the cheek. He pushes her away. Knives looks kinda sexy, wearing makeup and new clothes. \nKNIVES CHAU Do you like? \nSCOTT I...uh... LEONE STAREDOWNS all around. Stacey stares at Scott. Knives and Ramona stare at each other. Wallace stares at Jimmy. \nSCOTT (CONT'D) Have. To. Go. Scott scurries off. We hear feedback from a mic onstage. \nPROMOTER (O.S) This next band are from Brampton and they are Crash And The Boys. \n39 INT. THE ROCKIT, BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 39 \nScott runs backstage to see Stills obsessively flipping through a chart with hand drawn stats of their rival band. \nSTEPHEN STILLS This is a nightmare. Is this a nightmare? Wake up, wake up, wake up. \nKIM Once we're on stage you'll be fine. \nSTILLS We were just on stage. For sound check. The sound guy hated us. \nSCOTT It's just nerves! Pre-show jitters. People love us. Right? Scott sounds less than convincing. He looks up at Ramona and Knives sitting with Wallace, Jimmy and Stacey in the BALCONY. \nINTEGRATED FINAL 37. \n40 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 40 \nCrash and The Boys tune up. A drunk Wallace turns to Jimmy. \nWALLACE Jimmy. Do they rock or suck? \nJIMMY They...haven't started playing yet. \nWALLACE That was a test, Jimmy. You passed. \nCRASH Good evening. I am Crash, and these are the Boys. \nWALLACE \nIS THAT GIRL A BOY, TOO? \nCRASH Yes. TRASHA, 8 year old girl drummer, gives Wallace the finger. \nFIGHT! Scott throws his bass to Young Neil and BLOCKS Patel with his left arm, then PUNCHES him across the floor with his right. Patel LANDS like a cat, FLIPS his fringe and GLARES at Scott. \nMATTHEW PATEL Alright. Alright. \nWALLACE Watch out! It's that one guy! \nSCOTT Thank you, Wallace! Patel RUNS at Scott. Scott SPIN KICKS Patel in the chin and sends him flying into the air. They land in THE PIT, knocking hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle. \nMATTHEW PATEL You're quite the opponent, Pilgrim. \nSCOTT Who the hell are you anyway? The LIGHTING GUY spotlights the fighters. \nMATTHEW PATEL My name is Matthew Patel and I'm Ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend! \nSCOTT You're what? \nMATTHEW PATEL Ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend! All eyes WHIP up to Ramona... \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 40A. \n47 CONTINUED: (2) 47 \nRAMONA Anyone need another drink? Patel attacks Scott with spin kicks. Scott blocks. Patel punches. Scott blocks, then holds his hand up for a time-out. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 41. \n47 CONTINUED: (3) 47 \nSCOTT We're fighting because of Ramona? \nMATTHEW PATEL Didn't you get my e-mail explaining the situation? \nSCOTT I skimmed it. \nMATTHEW PATEL You will pay for your insolence! Patel attacks, landing kicks and punches. Scott evades and counter-attacks. Patel evades, then lands more punches. Scott jump-spins away from danger. They pause, breathing heavy. \nWALLACE What's up with his outfit? \nOTHER HECKLER Yeah! Is he a pirate? Scott looks at Patel's outfit. \nSCOTT Are you a pirate? \nMATTHEW PATEL Pirates are in this year! Patel attacks again. They exchange furious blows, until Patel puts Scott in a choke hold. Scott looks up to Ramona. \nSCOTT You really went out with this guy? \nRAMONA Yeah, in the seventh grade. The Lighting Guy SWINGS the spotlight to Ramona in the balcony. We see a sketchy childlike ANIMATED FLASHBACK. \nRAMONA (CONT'D) It was football season and for some reason, all the little jocks wanted me. Matthew was the only non-white, non-jock boy in school, probably in the entire state, so we joined forces and took 'em all out. We were one hell of a team. Nothing could beat Matthew's mystical powers. Nothing but pre-teen capriciousness. We only kissed once. After a week and a half, I told him to hit the showers. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 41A. \n47 CONTINUED: (4) 47 The spotlight swings back onto Scott and Patel. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 42. \n47 CONTINUED: (5) 47 \nSCOTT Dude, wait...mystical powers? Patel levitates into the air and points at Ramona. \nMATTHEW PATEL You'll pay for this, Flowers! Patel SNAPS his fingers and launches into a BOLLYWOOD SONG! \nMATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D) If you want to fight me, you're not the brightest. You won't know what's hit you in the slightest. Patel levitates into the air. Four hot girls in skirts with fangs and bat-wings appear in the air around him. \nMATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D) Me and my fireballs and my Demon Hipster Chicks, I'm talking the talk because I know I'm slick. Patel and the Demon Hipster Chicks shoot FIREBALLS at Scott. He flips back onto the stage, narrowly dodging the attack. \nMATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D) Fireball Girls! Take this sucker down. The Demon Hipster Chicks unleash more fireballs. Scott dodges. The house drum kit is trashed behind him. \nMATTHEW PATEL (CONT'D) Let us show him what we're all about. Scott hits the ground, dodging a third wave of fireballs. They explode Crash and the Boys in the wings. \nSCOTT That doesn't even rhyme. Scott rolls across the stage, GRABS one of Kim's CYMBALS and throws it Captain America style. It hits Patel square in the eyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish. \nMATTHEW PATEL This is impossible, how can it be?! Scott leaps into the air. Patel opens his eyes just in time to see Scott Pilgrim's FIST racing towards his face. \nSCOTT Open your eyes. Maybe you'll see. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 42A. \n47 CONTINUED: (6) 47 K.O!

Ramona passes Knives, who is being resuscitated by Tamara. \n49 INT. THE ROCKIT, STAGE - CONTINUOUS 49 \nScott picks up the coins onstage and counts them. \nSCOTT Aw man. $2.40? That's not even enough for the bus home. \nWALLACE Yes. I am stalking him later. \nSCOTT So, this Lucas Lee- \nWALLACE Lucas Lee is not important to you right now! Get out. \nSCOTT You suck. Surprising no one. Scott grumbles off. Wallace turns the television way up. We see Lucas Lee on a payphone in some crummy thriller. \nLUCAS LEE (ON TV) Listen close and listen hard, bucko. The next click is me hanging up. The one after that...is me pulling the trigger. \n54 EXT. PAYPHONE ON BUSY STREET - DAY 54 \nA shivering and annoyed Scott dials the payphone. \nSCOTT Oh, hey, Knives. Um, do you want to, like, talk or whatever? \nKNIVES CHAU (O.S.) Are you wearing a tan jacket? Like a spring jacket? And a hoodie? \nSCOTT Ummm... Scott checks what he's wearing. SPOOKY MUSIC underscores. \nKNIVES CHAU (O.S.) And a dorky hat?! \nSCOTT It's not dorky! Why are you psychic? A beaming Knives knocks on the payphone glass. \nSCOTT (CONT'D) Oh. Uh...okay. Hi. \nINTEGRATED FINAL 47. \n55 INT. SONIC BOOM - DAY 55 \nThe SPOOKY MUSIC continues on in the record store. Scott is on edge as Knives geeks over a standee for THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD: it features sultry blonde singer ENVY ADAMS posing and the rest of the band shrouded in shadow and mist. \nKNIVES CHAU I can't believe they're coming to town. Will you take me to the show? \nSCOTT Yeah, listen- The SPOOKY MUSIC gets louder, pounding inside Scott's head. \nKNIVES CHAU Oh, hey, I wanted to invite you over for dinner. \nSCOTT Like, Chinese food? \nKNIVES CHAU Yeah. \nSCOTT Hmm. It's not my favorite. \nKNIVES CHAU Yeah. Well, to meet my parents. It's my birthday dinner. \nSCOTT Uh...I think that's a really bad idea. Like, really, just so bad. \nKNIVES CHAU No, it's okay. Why? \nSCOTT Well I mean, I'm too old for you! \nKNIVES CHAU No you're not! My Dad is nine years older than my Mom... \nSCOTT And...and...are you even allowed to date outside your race or whatever? \nKNIVES CHAU I don't care. I'm in...LOVE! \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 47A. \n55 CONTINUED: 55 Knives is so smitten, the word actually appears onscreen. Scott brushes it away. The SPOOKY MUSIC comes to a stop. \nSCOTT Um, listen...I was thinking we should break up or whatever. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 48. \n55 CONTINUED: (2) 55 \nKNIVES CHAU Really? \nSCOTT Yeah...um...it's not going to work out. \nKNIVES CHAU Oh... Scott walks out, leaving Knives in the aisle. \n56 INT. THE BUS / RECORD STORE - DAY 56 \nScott sits on the bus alone, thinking about Knives. CROSSCUT with Knives still in the record store, in shock. ON THE BUS: Scott sighs, thinks of something happier... CROSSCUT with Ramona: rollerblading, her funky pink hair. ON THE BUS: Scott smiles, a little happier. \n57 INT/EXT. STEPHEN STILLS' BASEMENT - EVENING 57 \nSex Bob-Omb tune up. Kim spins a drumstick in her fingers. \nKIM PINE Where's Knives? Not coming tonight? \nSCOTT Oh. No. We broke up. Young Neil PAUSES his DS. Kim and Stills share a look. \nSCOTT (CONT'D) OH! Check it out, I learned the bass line from Final Fantasy 2. Scott plays the insanely simple video game tune. \nKIM PINE Scott, you are the salt of the earth. \nSCOTT Aw, thanks. \nKIM PINE Wait. I meant scum of the earth. \nSCOTT Aw, thanks. \nYOUNG NEIL You...you broke up with Knives? \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 49. \n57 CONTINUED: 57 \nSCOTT Yeah, but don't worry, maybe you'll meet my new new girlfriend soon. \nYOUNG NEIL Newnew. Kim mimes shooting herself. Stills unplugs Scott's amp. \nSTEPHEN STILLS Okay! From here on out, no GIRLFRIENDS or GIRLFRIEND talk at practice, whether they're old, new or new-new. We were lucky to survive that last round. This is sudden death now. Okay? \n58 CONTINUED: (3) 58 \nSCOTT Garlic bread is my favorite food. I could honestly eat it for every meal. Or just all the time without even stopping. \nRAMONA You'd get fat. \nSCOTT No. Why would I get fat? \nRAMONA Bread makes you fat. \nSCOTT Bread makes you FAT?? \n'15 MINUTES LATER' A nervy Scott serenades Ramona on his bass guitar. \nSCOTT So I wrote a song about you. \nRAMONA Oh yeah? \nSCOTT Yeah, it goes like this: Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ooooh. \nRAMONA I can't wait to hear it when it's finished. \nSCOTT Finished? \n'15 MINUTES LATER' Scott makes out with Ramona on the futon. Scott smiles as she runs her hands through his hair. \nRAMONA Your hair's pretty shaggy. \nSCOTT \nOH GOD! I NEED A HAIRCUT DON'T I?!? Scott sits up like a shot. Ramona is taken aback. \nRAMONA What? \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 53. \n58 CONTINUED: (4) 58 \nSCOTT Ha. No, sorry. It's just that I got... I got a bad haircut right before me and my big ex broke up. But it's so long ago, I can barely remember it... A deep voiced NARRATOR chimes in. Earl Jones deep. \nNARRATOR Scott is acutely aware that his last salon haircut took place exactly 431 days ago, three hours before his big breakup. He blames this largely on the haircut and has been cutting his own hair ever since. \nRAMONA Sounds like a bad time. \nSCOTT Not really. \nNARRATOR It was. \nSCOTT It was a mutual thing. \nNARRATOR It wasn't. \nSCOTT I mean, she told me it was mutual. \nNARRATOR She dumped him. It was brutal. \nRAMONA What was her name? \nSCOTT She was Nat when I knew her. But she stopped liking that name. Then...she stopped liking me... \nRAMONA Your hair is cute. I like it long. \nSCOTT But it'd be cuter short! Wouldn't it?! Scott disappears and just as quickly reappears, now wearing his dorky SNOW HAT, hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps. \nRAMONA What? Why are you wearing that? \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 54. \n58 CONTINUED: (5) 58 \nSCOTT I thought we could go for a walk. \n59 EXT. ENDLESS STAIRWAY - NIGHT 59 \n'15 MINUTES LATER' Scott and Ramona climb a STAIRWAY, long handrail between them. \nRAMONA Tell me we didn't come out here just so you could cover your hair with that hat. \nSCOTT Nooo. I just love me some walking. Putting one leg in front of the other. \nRAMONA You seem a little...heightened. \nSCOTT Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not that I do drugs, unless you do, in which case I do drugs all the time, every drug, but...you make me feel...I don't know. Things seem a little brighter around you or something. Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line. \nRAMONA What is this place? \nSCOTT A totally awesome castle. They're shooting this movie up here. Ramona looks up at the looming CASA LOMA, a castle surrounded by big, bright movie set lights. \nRAMONA Who's in it? \nSCOTT Winifred Hailey and some actor guy. \nRAMONA Oh, who? \nSCOTT I forget. Let's find out. \nINTEGRATED FINAL 55. \n60 EXT. CASA LOMA - CONTINUOUS 60 \nA crew readies a shot of WINIFRED HAILEY held hostage by some GOON. A STAND IN takes the place of the leading man.

Mr. Lee is travelling! \nRAMONA Mr. Lee? \nSCOTT ...no. \nLUCAS LEE Oh, well then don't worry about it. \nSCOTT Really? \nLUCAS LEE Yeah, bro. Let's get a beer. Lucas offers a hand. Scott goes to shake it. POW! Lucas gets him square in the mouth. Scott smiles through his aching jaw. \nSCOTT You are a pretty good actor. \nLUCAS LEE I'm going for the Oscar this year. \nSCOTT But are you a pretty good skater? \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 59. \n60 CONTINUED: (5) 60 \nLUCAS LEE I'm more than pretty good, ese.

Scott points to the LONG HANDRAIL on the stairs. \nLUCAS LEE It's called a grind, bro. \nSCOTT So can you do a grind thingy now? \nLUCAS LEE Are you serious? There's like 200 steps and the rails are garbage. \nSCOTT Hey, if it's too hardcore... \nLUCAS LEE You really think you can goad me into doing a trick like that? \nSCOTT There's girls watching. \nLUCAS LEE Somebody get me my board. Wallace taps Lucas' shoulder and hands him his skateboard. \nWALLACE Hi. Big fan. \nLUCAS LEE Why wouldn't you be? CLACK! Lucas GOES FOR IT, a perfect ollie onto the rail. Scott and Wallace watch as Lucas disappears from sight, sparking down the ENDLESS RAIL...HSSSSSSSSSSSSSS... Cut back to Scott & Wallace, impressed at Lucas. \nSCOTT Wow. \nHSSSSSSSSS... Cut back to Scott & Wallace, very impressed at Lucas. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 59A. \n60 CONTINUED: (6) 60 \nSCOTT Wow. \nHSSSSSSSSS... Cut back to Scott & Wallace.

Wallace cooks bacon in the kitchen (no pants). We hear the OUTGOING MESSAGE: This is an automated voice messaging system. RAMONA is not available, please record your message after the beep. \nSCOTT Hey. It's me, Scott again. Call me back. Scott Pilgrim. \n(HANGS UP) What's the deal? Seriously.

Seven little kisses? \nWALLACE Seven deadly X's. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 61. \n61 CONTINUED: 61 Wallace cocks an eyebrow. Scott slides to the floor. \nSCOTT Why does everything have to be so complicated? Wallace crouches down to join Scott on the floor. \nWALLACE If you want something bad, you have to fight for it. Step up your game. Break out the L-word. \nSCOTT Lesbian? \nWALLACE The other L-word. \nALT #1: \nMYSTERY ATTACKER \n(DIXIELAND ACCENT) Love to postpone, darlin', but I just cashed my last raincheck. \nSCOTT What's that from? \nMYSTERY ATTACKER \n(OWN VOICE) My brain! \nSCOTT Well whatever this is about, can it wait till I'm in the right frame of mind? \nALT #2: \nMYSTERY ATTACKER Nuh uh. This is one nightmare you can't wake up from. \nSCOTT Wait, am I asleep right now? \nMYSTERY ATTACKER No. \nSCOTT So, technically this is not a nightmare. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 64A. \n62 CONTINUED: (3) 62 \nMYSTERY ATTACKER Right. \nSCOTT So how can I not wake up? If I'm not actually asleep. \nMYSTERY ATTACKER Don't question me! Scott shakes his head, baffled. \nSCOTT Well, I'm really, really not up for this. Whatever it is. \nMYSTERY ATTACKER Okay little chicken, then I'll see you later. But you won't see me. Because I'll be deadly serious next time. \nSCOTT What? \nMYSTERY ATTACKER Nevermind! PAF - the Mystery Attacker vanishes. Scott looks to the sky. \nSCOTT Oh man. Someone help me. \n63 EXT. BLOOR STREET - DAY 63 \nScott is in his usual payphone, dialing Stacey frantically. \nSCOTT It's Scott. \nSTACEY (O.S.) What did he do this time? \nSCOTT No, it's Scott. It's actually me. \nSTACEY (O.S.) What did you do this time? \nSCOTT I didn't do anything.

THE SECOND CUP - CONTINUOUS 64 \nScott approaches the counter. Stacey has her back turned. \nSCOTT Think I'll make it a decaf today. Stacey turns around, revealing herself to be JULIE! \nJULIE \nSCOTT PILGRIM! \nSCOTT AH! What did you do with my sister? Stacey taps on the window outside, mouthing that she has to go. Scott turns back to Julie, not happy. \nJULIE What can I fucking get you? \nSCOTT Is there anywhere you don't work? \nJULIE They're called 'jobs', something a fuckball like you wouldn't know anything about. And by the way, I can't believe you fucking asked Ramona out after I specifically told you not to fucking do that! (Note to concerned reader: Everytime Julie says \"FUCK\", a black bar comes out of her mouth and the sound is bleeped.) \nSCOTT How do you do that with your mouth? \nJULIE Neverfuckingmind how I do it! What do you have to say for yourself? \nSCOTT Uh. Can I get a caramel macchiato? \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 66. \n64 CONTINUED: 64 \nJULIE Maybe it's high fucking time you took a look in a mirror before you wreak havoc on another girl. \nSCOTT Me? Wreak havoc? Julie points at THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD poster behind the counter with concert dates at the bottom. \nJULIE Fucking speaking of fucking which, I hear the girl that kicked your heart in the ass is walking the streets of Toronto again. \nSCOTT So I can pick up my coffee over here? Scott retreats away from Julie and bumps right into... RAMONA. They share an awkward moment. She looks at the floor. \nRAMONA Sorry that got a little crazy last night. \nOTHER SCOTT And you didn't bang her? Are you gay? \nSCOTT I couldn't stop thinking about my stupid ex-girlfriend. A bleary Jimmy sits up between them all. \nJIMMY Is that the Uma Thurman movie? \nWALLACE Scott. Just because Envy's back in town doesn't make it not over. \nSCOTT Double negative. Tricky. \nOTHER SCOTT It's over. Move on. \nWALLACE Word. \nJIMMY Mm. Scott stands (no pants). Music swells. \nSCOTT Right. I'm not gonna let her toy with me. From this moment on, I will think of Envy Adams no more! \n67 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - DAY 67 \nSTEPHEN STILLS I have distressing news.

Because I really don't think I can take it. \nSTEPHEN STILLS No. The Clash At Demonhead are doing a secret show tomorrow night. And Envy asked us to open for them. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 70. \n67 CONTINUED: (2) 67 \nSCOTT I hate you. \nSTEPHEN STILLS A gig is a gig is a gig. Is a gig. Maybe you can put your history aside until we get through this thing. You know, for the band? For the band. For the band? \nSCOTT Can't we do our own secret shows? \nKIM PINE All our shows are secret shows. \nSTEPHEN STILLS We're doing it. G-man might be there! We play the next round of the battle Saturday. We need to get some buzz going. We need groundswell. We need stalkers. Stills paces past the window to reveal...KNIVES CHAU OUTSIDE. CRASH ZOOM on her tearful face, pressed against the window. TOTALLY CRUSHED to see Scott cuddling with Ramona. \nSCOTT What would you do? If your ex was in a band and they wanted you to open for them? \nRAMONA If my ex was in the band? \nSCOTT Yeah. \nRAMONA It might be a little awkward. But maybe it's the grown up thing to do. \nSCOTT Yeah, we're all adults right? \n68 INT.

Okay, this really burns. \nTAMARA We should rinse- \nKNIVES CHAU I mean, he knew I was cool but he thought I was too young, so he tried to find someone cool but old. \nTAMARA She's cool? I thought she was fat- \nKNIVES CHAU Well she THINKS she's cool. This is all her fault. \nTAMARA Why? Tamara turns the faucet on and rinses Knives hair. \nKNIVES CHAU It MUST be her fault. Obviously it's just a twist of fate or whatever, isn't it? Star crossed lovers! Born too late! Knives looks in the mirror: HER HAIR IS EXACTLY LIKE RAMONA. \nKNIVES CHAU (CONT'D) Oh God...I look so...so good. Knives throws a long scarf on, looking sexy, eyes narrowing. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 72. \n68B CONTINUED: 68B \nKNIVES CHAU (CONT'D) Scott Pilgrim destroyed my heart.

Todd smirks. \nTODD INGRAM That's right. I'm not afraid to hit a girl. I'm a rock star. \nYOUNG NEIL You punched the highlights out of her hair! ANGLE on Knives. Her hair is black and plain as before. \nYOUNG NEIL He punched the highlights. Out. Of. Her. Hair. \nENVY You're incorrigible. \nTODD INGRAM I don't know the meaning of the word. Young Neil escorts Knives out. Todd sits back down like nothing happened. Scott's face is a bright shade of rage. \nJULIE So, are you guys doing anything fun while you're in town? \nTODD INGRAM Fun? In Toronto? \nSCOTT That is IT, you cocky cock! YOU'LL PAY \nFOR YOUR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY! Scott LEAPS across the table and SWINGS a punch at Todd. Todd THRUSTS a hand out and telekinetically FREEZES SCOTT IN THE AIR. Scott hovers, grasping his neck, choking. Todd's hair magically forms into a FAUXHAWK. \nSCOTT KK...my neck...yy...your hair... \nENVY Didn't you know? Todd's Vegan. \nTODD INGRAM It's not a big deal. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 78. \n77 CONTINUED: (4) 77 Todd telekinetically HURLS Scott through the club's wall! Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb peer through the newly made hole in the wall, to see Scott sprawled on some trash bags. He tries to keep cool, despite being in a lot of pain. \nSCOTT No kidding...anyone can be...vegan. \nTODD INGRAM Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe. \nSCOTT Ovo what? \nTODD INGRAM I partake not in the meat nor breastmilk or ovum of any creature that has a face. \nENVY Short answer: Being vegan just makes you better than most people. \nTODD INGRAM Bingo. Todd lifts up Scott telekinetically and throws him miles into the air. Scott sails out of shot and into space. \nSTEPHEN STILLS Hey man, question. I always wondered, how does not eating dairy products give you psychic powers? \nTODD INGRAM You know how you only use ten percent of your brain? Well, it's because the other 90% is filled up with curds and whey. \nENVY I'm sorry, but that's pathetic. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 82. \n79 CONTINUED: (2) 79 \nTODD INGRAM Dude. I can see in your mind's eye that you poured Half & Half into one of these coffees in an attempt to make me break vegan edge. I'll take the one with soy. Thanks, tool. Todd floats to the ground, takes one of the cups and drinks. \nSCOTT Actually, I poured soy in this cup, but thought real hard about pouring it in that one. You know, in my mind's eye or whatever. \nTODD INGRAM What are you talking about? \nSCOTT You just drank Half & Half. TWO TRENDY POLICE TYPES BUST IN THROUGH THE WALL, making two more holes and pointing their fingers like deadly weapons. \nVEGAN POLICE OFFICERS Freeze!

Scott sighs and holds a cold Coke Zero on his forehead. \nRAMONA Are you okay? \nSCOTT Uh huh. \nRAMONA You sure about that? \nSCOTT Do I look like I'm not okay? Scott does not look okay. Stills coughs. \nSTEPHEN STILLS We're still going to the after show right? \nKIM PINE I'm not sure it's gonna be much of a party, I think a third of the band just went '\u009cpoom'\u009d. \nSTEPHEN STILLS Cool bands never go to their own after parties.

He was totally awesome and I kicked him so far he saw the curvature of the earth! Does that make you feel any better? \nRAMONA Well now you are being a total ass. Welcome to the club. In the back glass of the bar, Scott sees his reflection: fringed hair, wicked glare. He catches himself. \nSCOTT Sorry. I'm not usually like this. \nRAMONA Hey, don't worry. I don't know what I'm like anymore. \nSCOTT I guess this whole ex-boyfriends thing is really messing with my head. \nRAMONA Exes. \nSCOTT Why do you keep saying- PAF! A foot appears out of nowhere and KICKS Scott in the head, sending him flying across the dance floor.

Ramona CATCHES her foot mid-air. Roxy flips out of the hold. \nRAMONA Do that again and I will end you. \nROXY Back off hasbian. If Gideon can't have you, no one can. The League hath spoken.

KICK HER IN THE BALLS, \nRAMONA! With blinding speed, Roxy slips her belt off and WHIPS A RAZOR SHARP FLYING GUILLOTINE BELT BUCKLE at Ramona! Ramona CARTWHEELS as the buckle sails between her legs and SMASHES into a DISCO BALL. Mirrored shards fly everywhere. PAF! Roxy vanishes as Ramona SWINGS the hammer at her. It smashes a speaker. Sound on one side of the room cuts out. Ramona turns around just in time to see Roxy's deadly belt SAILING towards her. She BLOCKS with the hammer. The belt wraps around it. Roxy HURLS the hammer out the window. \nROXY I'm sending you back to Gideon in a thousand pieces, you slag. Ramona springs off of various pieces of furniture, LEAPING towards Roxy and PUNCHING HER IN THE FACE. Roxy REELS and SLAMS into the wall, leaving a dent in it. \nRAMONA I'd rather be dead than go back. He's a creep, you're a bitch and you all deserve each other. \nROXY Give it a rest, Ramona.

Roxy then KICKS Scott into the ceiling. He lands HARD on the floor. \nROXY (CONT'D) Every Pilgrim reaches the end of his journey. Some sooner than others.

Sex Bob-Omb stare up at the Katayanagi amps, sweating behind their instruments. Stills looks into the audience positioned between the bands: a legion of identical INDIE TEENS. \nSTEPHEN STILLS We shouldn't even be here. We shouldn't even be here. Stills tries to run. Scott grabs him and pulls him back. \nSCOTT Come on man! I put aside my problems for the music. If I can do that, we can do anything. \nKIM PINE Did you speak to Ramona then? \nSCOTT What?

THE DREAM DESERT - DAY 95 \nScott sits up next to a lone cactus, rubbing his temples. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 109A. \n95 CONTINUED: 95 \nSCOTT Ugh. Ramona appears out of nowhere; fainter than before. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 110. \n95 CONTINUED: (2) 95 \nRAMONA I'm sorry. Dying probably sucks. \nSCOTT You know what sucks? Getting killed by THAT guy. Why him? \nRAMONA It's complicated. \nSCOTT Well, maybe now would be the time to get into it. Seeing as I'm about to die. \nRAMONA Alright... the truth is, it was me who was obsessed. I was crazy about him. But he ignored me. I was more alone when we were together than I ever was on my own. That's why I had to leave... and that's when he started paying attention. \nSCOTT So why go back? \nRAMONA I can't help myself around him, Scott. He just... has a way of getting into my head. \nSCOTT Well, that's legitimately disappointing. I really will leave you alone forever now... \nRAMONA No. I mean, he literally has a way of getting into my head. Ramona lifts her hair up on the back of her head, revealing a blinking CHIP implanted on her skull. \nSCOTT That is evil. \n", "test3_true": "SCOTT So this kinda sucks for everybody, eh? \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 111. \n95 CONTINUED: (3) 95 \nRAMONA I'm sorry it had to end this way. We had a good run, I guess. \nSCOTT You can't say I didn't try. I really fought for you back there. \nRAMONA Uh-huh. The winds blow harder, Ramona seeming to fade away. \nRAMONA But someone was fighting pretty hard for you back there. Scott's eyes go wide with epiphany, \nSCOTT Knives? \nRAMONA I wish I was ever as fanatically devoted to anything as that girl is to you. Ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand. \nSCOTT I feel like I learned something. Which would be great if I wasn't dead. Ramona is gone. Scott slumps to his knees. \nSCOTT So...so alone. DA-DING. The PILGRIM-HEAD appears and rotates around Scott. \nSCOTT Ahhhhhh... We FLASH BACK to Scott swiping the PILGRIM HEAD, then FAST FORWARD through the breakup with Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb. We hear Scott screaming throughout this magical restart. \nSCOTT \n...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA... \n96 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 96 \nWe FAST FORWARD all the way to Wallace's apartment, as Scott enters. He flicks the light on. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 112. \n96 CONTINUED: 96 \nSCOTT \n...AAAAAAAAAHHH! I CAN'T BELIEVE I \nHAD TO SEE THAT AGAIN! \nSOME GUY (O.S.) Again? \nWALLACE (O.S.) Turn off the light! Scott flicks the light off. On PITCH BLACK... \nSCOTT Wallace, when my journey began, I was living in an ordinary world. Ramona skated through my dreams and it was like a call to adventure, a call I considered refusing. But my Mentor, that's you, told me if I want something bad enough I have to fight for it. So I did. There were tests, allies, enemies. I approached a deep cave and went through a crazy ordeal, during which I totally seized the sword. Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected! Now I realize what I should have been fighting for all along. But before I do that, I need to ask one final favor of you. \nWALLACE (O.S.) Sure thing, guy. \nSCOTT Could you put a robe on and hand me the phone? Wallace flicks on a bedside lamp, hands him the phone. \nSCOTT Toronto. Chaos Theatre. Gideon Graves. \n(BEAT) Tell him Scott Pilgrim is calling. \nGIDEON GRAVES (O.S.) Scott. I was just about to- \nSCOTT Hey, pal. I feel terrible about everything. I don't want any hard feelings, so I figure why not be the bigger man and give you a call. \nGIDEON GRAVES (O.S.) Um... \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 112A. \n96 CONTINUED: (2) 96 \nSCOTT Sorry, what I meant to say is '\u009cI'm coming over to kill you'\u009d. Scott hangs up and heads for the door, hardcore. \nWALLACE \nGO KICK THAT GUY'S ASS! Wallace stands to high five Scott, exposing his junk. \nWALLACE (CONT'D) Ah, sorry. \n(CONTINUED) \nINTEGRATED FINAL 113. \n96 CONTINUED: (3) 96 \nSCOTT You seen one... \n97 EXT. STREETS OF TORONTO - DAY 97 \nScott Pilgrim RUNS towards the desolate WAREHOUSES. The same HIPSTER KID smokes a cigarette against the wall. \nSCOTT Your hair looks stupid. The Hipster Kid EXPLODES into COINS. \n98 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 98 \nScott approaches the two Hipster Kids guarding the ELEVATOR. \nHIPSTER KID '\u0098Sup? \nSCOTT Whatever. Scott SPLIT KICKS them in the faces, knocking them out. \n99 INT. CHAOS THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 99 \nDING! Scott exits the elevator and steps into GIDEON'S \nUNDERGROUND LAIR OF COOL SHIT: THE CHAOS THEATRE...AGAIN. \nCOMEAU Yeah, their first album is so- Scott KNOCKS DOWN Comeau and looks to Sex Bob-Omb. \nSTEPHEN STILLS Scott!

INT.  ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY/COMMAND CENTER - AFTERNOON 
Cpts.  Hendrix, before Hummel. 
Frye, and Darrow, and Sgt.  Crisp at attention Maj.  Baxter at Hummells side. 
HUMMEL At ease, Gentlemen.  It is traditional for me to meet with my officers before an operation.  The heart performs one thing, the legs another, the brain another - all better function together or the body becomes ill, is prone to disease. (beat) Major Baxter, Gunny Crisp and I have been on the front lines since 'Nam.' Captain Hendrix was my adjutant in the Gulf.  Get a haircut, Pete, you're lookin' like a beatnik. (the crew-cutted HENDRIX smiles Captain Frye, Captain Darrow.) You and your men are new to me. 
CAPTAIN FRYE Would the General like a recitation of our service records? 
HUMMEL I'm well aware of your service records, Captain, they are excellent.  I want to be clear on why you - why all of us are here.  You both stand to profit from this. 
CAPTAIN FRYE Profit is not my motive, sir.  I am here to redress a wrong. 
CAPTAIN DARROW Yes, sir, and to learn some people a lesson. 
HUMMEL This country has places where wrongs are redressed, Captain Darrow: They are called courts of law.  In the military, they are called Courts Martial. This country has places where lessons a-re leaned.  They are called schools.  Am I confusing you? 
CAPTAIN DARROW Well, sir, frankly ... EL I see that I am ' (beat) 
HUMMEL The only accurate term for what we are doing here is treason. Plain and simple.  An insurrection against a government to which we have sworn allegiance.  Everyone in this room must understand that. 
Hummel looks from face to face, studying each. 
HUMMEL The question is what kind of traitor are we.  Coward or lion? Benedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson?  I have posed that question to myself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear.  Have all of you? 
HUMMELS' OFFICERS Yes, sir. 
HUMMEL Within thirty-two.hours you will leave this country and not return.  All of you can live with that? 
OTHER OFFICERS (unison) Yes, sir.

{"train": "HELLRAISER by CLive Barker - July 28, 1986 Draft \nHELLRAISER \nA Screenplay by Clive Barker \nParagan Film Productions Ltd (C)  Clive Barker 28.7.86            115 Flood Street, London.  SW3 \n1    TITLE SEQUENCE \nIn darkness, a blood-curdling cacophony:  the squeal of unoiled winches, the rasp of hooks and razors being sharpened; and worse, the howl of tormented souls.  Above this din one particular victim yells for mercy - a mixture of tears and roars of rage. \nBy degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by the surrounding tumult, until without warning his voice pierces the confusion afresh - this time reduced to naked scream. \nAnd with the sound, an image. \nA house:  NUMBER 55, LODOVICO STREET, an old, three storey, late Victorian house, with gaunt trees lining its overgrown garden.  Its curtains are drawn, there is newspaper over its top window.  The titles begin to run, as we approach the house down the driveway. \nWe move inside, to the hallway.  The cries are louder now. \nRoom by room, we explore the empty house, while the titles continue to run.  It has been left empty for many years, though much of its furniture remains, covered in dust-sheets.  On the mantelpiece of one room, a plaster saint.  In the kitchen, evidence of life here.  Opened tins; bread; bottles of spirits; a glass. \nWe move upstairs, gliding along the corridor of the lower landing.  The din is furious now.  On the floor of one room, a makeshift bed: blankets strewn; an open suitcase; more liquor. \nWe move up a flight and approach a room off the upper landing, the door of which is ajar.  The light within swings backwards and forwards, spilling into the passageway. \nAs we reach the door, the screams from within halt abruptly. \nWe can hear a bell now, which has been pealing steadily throughout this opening sequence. \nAs we move through the door, the titles end. \n2    INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT \nThe bare bulbs in the room we've entered swing violently, disorienting us.  There are chains - dozens of them - disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling: all are swinging back and forth.  Some end in hooks, with pieces of skin and sinew adhering; some are serrated, others simply drip blood. \nThe bell tolls on. \nOn the blood-spattered floor, a box, some six inches square, which resembles an elaborate Chinese puzzle box.  Later, we'll learn its name and function. It's called the Lament Configuration, and it's a way to raise Hell.  LITERALLY. For now, it remains an enigma. \nA hand, its flesh systematically pierced with needles, reaches down and picks the box up. \nIn close up we see just what an elaborate construction it is, made up of sliding panels and mysterious chambers.  It is open at present, its polished innards exposed.  Out of it, a banal melody, played on a hidden mechanism.  The hands, which belong to one of the demons - a CENOBITE - move over the box. \nCENOBITE (unseen) It's over ... \nDelicately, the hands begin to reconstruct the box, sliding the well-oiled parts back into place, the tune simplifying with each manoeuvre. \nThe room is getting darker.  The chains are disappearing into the gloom. \nWe see tantalizing glimpses of other figures, turning from the light and fading into the darkness.  We catch sight of monstrous faces, but only for the briefest of moments.  Then they're gone. \nThe box is almost returned to its unopened condition. \nThe last sounds to fade are the tune from the box, and the bell. \nIt tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid into place. \nThe light stops swinging. The panel clicks.  The tune stops. \nAt last, a long shot of the room.  At the far end the window is covered with yellowed newspapers.  There is dust settling through the air. \nOtherwise it is empty. \nThe bell fades. \nIt's as if nothing ever happened here. \nExcept ... \nSomewhere, very quietly, a creaking that could be the sound of floorboards, or the low, agonized gasp of a thing barely alive. \n3    INT.   HALLWAY    DAY \nThe wind is blaring as we watch the door of Number 55. From the doorstep, voices.  One is that of LARRY COTTON, the other his wife JULIA.  Clearly LARRY is attempting to get inside.  We hear the sound of keys tried in the lock. \nLARRY It's one of these. \nJULIA We're going to freeze to death. \nJULIA I thought half of it was your brother's? \nLARRY He won't complain.  He can pay off some of his creditors. \nLARRY is getting more enthusiastic about the place by the moment.  He leaves the room, moving past JULIA to explore further. \nLARRY You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it.  She'll love it. \nJULIA You mean we're moving in? \nLARRY pauses.  Looks at her. \nLARRY You don't like it? \nJULIA shrugs. \nJULIA It's better than Brooklyn. \nShe turns back down the hallway. He watches her, then follows. \nLARRY You're still blaming me. \nJULIA No.  I'm not. \nLARRY You wanted to come back to London.  We came back. \nWe are hearing the tip of a debate they've had dozens of times, which immediately annoys them both. \nJULIA All right. \nLARRY So what's the argument? \nJULIA (cold) No argument. \nLARRY Oh Christ.  Julia ... \nJULIA wanders back to the bottom of the stairs.  Then starts to climb. \nLARRY (exasperated, to himself) Shit. \n8    INT.   LANDING   DAY \nJULIA climbs the stairs, her face charged with suppressed feeling.  She's sick of LARRY; his enthusiasm depresses her, his compromises anger her.  What's between them is stale, like this house. \n9    INT.    TORTURE ROOM   DAY \nThe door opens a fraction. \n10   INT.   KITCHEN    DAY \nLARRY has stepped into the kitchen, to find the remains of the food we briefly glimpsed in the titles sequence, now rotted and fungal.  It smells, to judge the expression on his face.  It also puzzles him. Then, from above: \nJULIA Larry! \nHe leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the bottom of the stairs. \nLarry! \nLARRY I hear you. \nHe starts up the stairs. \n11   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY \nLARRY reaches the top of the stairs. \nLARRY Where are you? \nJULIA (out of sight) In here. \nLARRY follows JULIA's voice to the end of the corridor. JULIA is standing in a doorway.  Beyond, the 'bedroom' we saw in the titles sequence, untouched since then. \nJULIA Squatters? \nLARRY steps past her, and throws back the blankets. Wood-lice scurry away.  He goes to the suitcase, and starts looking through it.  Besides clothes there's a lot else that speaks of its owner: bric-a-brac picked up in a lifetime of adventuring; handful of bullets; Fragments of an erotic statue; coins and notes from a dozen countries.  Amongst the stuff, some photographs. LARRY peers at them.  One pictures a good-looking intense man in his mid to late thirties, in bed with a naked Chinese girl. \nLARRY Frank. \nAt the door, we see JULIA almost flinch at the name. \nKIRSTY I said: I found a room. \nWe begin to draw back from KIRSTY now, as she continues to speak to her father.  She's sitting on a battered chair by the door.  The room she's in is cramped and dirty. From outside, the sound of trains going by. \nLARRY (V.0.) I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile? \nKIRSTY (pained) No Dad. \nLARRY (V.0.) You'd like the house. \nKIRSTY YOU'D like my room. \nLARRY (V.0.) Do you want me to come over? \nKIRSTY (hastily) No, no.  Not just yet.  It needs ... er ... some work. \nThat it does.  The place, now we've got a good view of it, is a total dump. \nLARRY (V.0.) Well I want you to see the house. \nKIRSTY I'm not going to change my mind, Dad. \nAs she speaks she reaches forward to pull a picture, tacked to the wall, of a ourangoutang, with breasts collaged onto it, down.  She succeeds.  Beneath there's a large hole in the wall, which the picture was there to conceal.  Plaster falls from it. \nKIRSTY (mouths the word) Great. \nLARRY (V.0.) Well come over, will you? See the place? \nKIRSTY Maybe tomorrow.  I got to go look for a job. \nLARRY (V.0.) O.K. Honey. Well you take care. I love you. \nKIRSTY I love you too. \nShe puts the receiver down.  As she does so the small table on which the 'phone is sitting collapses.  She covers her face with her hand. \n22   INT.   HALLWAY OF LODOVICO STREET    DAY \nJULIA is three steps from the bottom of the stairs. \nLARRY Well? \nJULIA (resigned) Why not? \nLARRY (smiles; he's pleased) We'll move in Sunday. \n23   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY \nA church bell rings.  Off-screen, we hear voices: two men are attempting to move a bed into the house with LARRY masterminding the manoeuvres.  We HEAR their efforts, but we don't yet see them.  Our interest is in JULIA, who is unpacking a tea-chest in a room which is still full of draped furniture. \n1ST MAN (O.S.) We're not going to get it in. \n2ND MAN (O.S.) Tip it!  Tip it! \nLARRY (O.S.) Wait!  Wait!  Watch the fucking paint work. \n1ST MAN (O.S.) Look, do you want the bed in or not? \nLARRY (0.S.) Just take it slowly. \n1ST MAN (O.S.) Oh, sod you. \n2ND MAN (O.S.) Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says. \nLARRY (O.S.) It'll go in. \n1ST MAN Famous last fucking words. \nJULIA's face through this has been almost devoid of expression.  She's holding so many feelings inside; deep inside.  Now she moves from one box to another, and opens it to find it full of bathroom bric-a-brac. She picks it up and goes through into the hallway. \nThe bell continues to ring. \n24   INT.   HALLWAY    DAY \nThe three sweating men have the bed wedged in the door. \nLARRY (not seeing Julia) Alright, let's give it another try. \n2ND MAN (sees Julia) Do you really need this bed, lady? \nLARRY Julia's my second wife. \n2ND MAN (weakly) Lucky man. \nLARRY Damn right.  Now are we going to move the bed or not? \n28   INT.   KITCHEN   DAY \nThe kitchen is chaotic.  Cutlery, crockery, utensils, pans and foodstuffs have been heaped on every available surface.  KIRSTY has found the kettle, but is having difficulty turning on the tap.  She struggles with it.  No joy.  Just a rattling sound in the pipes as the system lurches into action. \n29   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY \nThe pipes rattle and chug behind the plaster.  The CAMERA moves along the corridor, hugging the wall. At the end of the corridor stands JULIA, in a patch of sunlight.  She has the photograph of FRANK in her hands. \nShe looks intently at it. \nA CLOSE-UP of the photograph.  Then FRANK's voice. \nFRANK Can I come in? \nJULIA looks up from the photograph. \n30   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY \nA front door opens.  On the step of another house stands FRANK, with two suitcases.  It's raining outside; HARD.  The rain has plastered his hair to his scalp, which only emphasizes his raw good looks. He's unshaven; his eyes are dark, and intense. Again, the line she remembers: \nFRANK Can I come in? \nThe splash of rain on the step becomes a spurt of water, as we \nCUT BACK TO \nthe present day. \n31   INT.   KITCHEN   DAY \nThe tap has come on suddenly, spraying KIRSTY with water.  She jumps back, soaked. \nKIRSTY Shit!  Shit! \nShe reaches to turn the pressure down. \n32   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY \nThe men are struggling with the bed again. \nLARRY (calls through) Are you O.K.? \nKIRSTY (from kitchen) Sure. \n33   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY \nAgain, JULIA returns her gaze to the photograph. \n34   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY \nThe same scene:  FRANK in the doorstep.  Now we \nCUT TO \nthe person who opened the door.  It's JULIA; a younger JULIA, her hair arranged differently, her clothes brighter.  It is two weeks before her marriage to LARRY.  She looks at the man on the doorstep without a trace of recognition on her face. \nFRANK You're Julia, right? \nJULIA That's right.  Who are you? \nFRANK (a dazzling smile) I'm brother Frank. \nJULIA (smiles) Oh. \nFRANK I came for the wedding. \nHe looks at her, eyes glittering.  His hold on her is almost mesmeric. \nThere is going to BE a wedding? \nJULIA Oh.  Oh yes. \nFRANK Well can I come in or not? \nJULIA But you said - \nFRANK I don't want to see the dress. \nJULIA lets the dress drop a few inches in front of her.  She stares at FRANK. \nFRANK You know what I want. \nStill she doesn't let the 'defence' that the dress offers - a reminder of her imminent marriage - fall. She stares though, and there's an invitation in her eyes. \nFRANK I want you. \nNow we \nCUT TO \nFRANK.  He is not so beraggled as in the first scene, but the heat of the day has brought a sheen of sweat to his face.  Standing half in shadow he looks almost dangerous. \nNow JULIA lets the dress drop, putting it on the bed behind her. \nFRANK That's better \nFRANK steps towards her. \nJULIA What about Larry - \nFRANK Forget him. \nFRANK takes hold of her.  She doesn't resist him, though there is barely disguised fear on her face. He puts his hand inside her blouse. \n42   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY \nIn extreme CLOSE UP, JULIA blinks into the light through the window, as LARRY's voice from downstairs calls her from her reverie. \nLARRY Slowly, will you?  Slowly! \nAgain, a white-CUT, from which emerges: \n43   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY \nThe two are naked on the bed, both sweating now. Beneath them, the wedding dress, crushed under their weight. \nTheir love-making is not straight-forward: there is an element of erotic perversity in the way FRANK licks at her face, almost like an animal, his hold on her too tight to be loving.  The sequence escalates into a series of strange details from their locked bodies.  Nails digging into palms; sweat rivulets running down their torsoes.  And once in a while we see their faces.  JULIA watching FRANK, mesmerized and amused by his intensity; FRANK almost pained by his desire to push the experience TO THE LIMIT.  Their passion is rendered stranger still by the way the light through the window falls on their bodies, making striped creatures of them. \nAt last, as their urgency increases, we move up until we're looking directly down on the bed. From here it is JULIA's face we can see, and the ecstasy of the moment has seized her.  Her arms are flung up over her head; her eyes are closed as she murmurs: \nJULIA Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God. \nThe scene whites out. \n44   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY \nJULIA is still staring into the light.  She sobs, very quietly. \nJULIA (a whisper) Oh Frank ... \n45   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY \nDownstairs, LARRY and the men have moved the bed across the hall to the bottom of the stairs. \nAll three are weary now, and getting careless. \nAs they start up the stairs we see trouble ahead for LARRY, whose hand is moving closer and closer to a nail proturbing from the woodwork of the bannister. \nLARRY (to Movers) Will you take the weight while I take a step up? \nHe backs towards the stairs - and the nail. \nDamn it, will you take the - \nThe side of his hand is impaled bythe nail.  He cries out.  The weight of the bed, which he cannot relinquish, drives the nail deeper, and gouges a long cut from the ball of his thumb to his wrist.  Blood pours out. \nLARRY Christ! \n1ST MAN What's the problem? \nLARRY My fucking hand! \nHe drops his edge of the bed, and disengages his hand from the nail upon which he's injured himself.  He lifts his hand, from which blood is pouring. \nJULIA Take it slowly. \nLARRY So damn stupid. \nJULIA You're done worse. \nLARRY I'll be scarred for life. \nJULIA No you won't. \n50   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY \nKIRSTY is half way up the stairs, as JULIA and LARRY head down. \nKIRSTY What happened? \nJULIA Just an accident.  He's all right.  Will you drive?  He needs stitches. \nKIRSTY Sure. \nJULIA The keys are in the kitchen. \nKIRSTY heads back to the kitchen.  JULIA helps LARRY towards the front door. \nThe CAMERA swings away from them, upstairs, and begins to track ... \nLAP-DISSOLVE TO: \nINT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY \n... we continue to track, towards the Torture Room. \nDownstairs, the front door slams. \nLAP-DISSOLVE TO: \nINT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY \nFrom outside, the sound of a car door slamming.  An engine starts.  The car drives away. \nWe move towards the blood on the floor.  As we watch, it begins to disappear, as if being absorbed by the room.  We pan up to the wall.  The plaster is not quite smooth; indeed, it now begins to grow restless, and cracks.  Something begins to move in the wall ... \n51   INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT \nAn explosion of laughter.  We \nCUT TO \nthe remains of a rack of lamb, its gravy now congealed, scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there. This is the centre-piece of a table reduced to a battlefield by the guests who are laughing off-screen. We pass along the table, taking in dirty plates and cutlery, napkins, glasses and emptied wine bottles. Finally, we reach JULIA, who is still sitting at the table, while the others have retired to more comfortable seats.  She looks utterly miserable, and a little drunk. \nThe room has been spruced up for the party.  Candles are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are pictures on the walls.  But this is essentially cosmetic.  The place has not been refurnished or re- decorated. \nWe move to the party guests.  Two, we recognize: KIRSTY, and LARRY - who is presently entertaining the gathering with an account of his accident.  The others are new faces.  An American couple:  BILL UNDERWOOD and his wife EVELYN, who are of an age with LARRY, and a younger, bespectacled man - a work colleague of LARRY's - STEVE O'DONNELL.  All are drunk. A brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and half a dozen other liquer bottles besides.  STEVE, it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on KIRSTY. \nLARRY is half-way through his hospital story, gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale, much to the pleasure of the rest.  His hand and lower arm are heavily bandaged. \nLARRY - always hated the sight of my own blood.  I go out like a light. Anybody else's?  no problem.  But mine ... you know ... goes straight to my head.  Anyhow, this damn doctor's poking around and I'm saying: I'm going to pass out, and he's saying, no you're not, no you're not.  Next thing I know - \nWe \nCUT BACK TO \nJULIA, who watches her husband, unamused. \nLARRY - I wake up On the floor. \nGales of laughter at this. \nAnd it was HIM who was looking sick. \nBILL Probably thought you'd sue. \nLARRY I should do it! \nEVELYN Doctors - \nLARRY I know.  And he's saying: I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. \nBILL HE'S sorry. \n54   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT \nThe sound of laughter is considerably dimmed in here; it's barely audible.  But there is another sound, a shifting sound in the corner of the room. \nShe reaches for the light switch, and turns it on. The bulb's been broken however.  She stares around the room, trying to make sense of the shadows. \nNervously, she approaches the wall, on which four streaks of light from the window fall.  Now she looks towards the window and realizes that the newspaper has been torn, as if by four fingers.  Her breath catches.  Suddenly, she's afraid. \nShe stands absolutely still, eyes wide in the gloom. \nJULIA Who's there? \nOn the far side of the room, a movement in the shadows. \nJULIA almost retreats, but something keeps her staring into the murk, as SOMETHING - the remnants of a human form made of twisted, blistered strands of flesh, raises its head.  It's squatting against the wall, unable to lift itself into a standing position.  Its eyes, however, have life in them: and hunger. This, though he's unrecognizable, is FRANK. \nFRANK (a pained whisper) Julia. \nJULIA Oh my God. \nFRANK Don't look at me. \nJULIA Who are you? \nFRANK I said: don't look. \nShe looks away. \nHelp me. \nJULIA Tell me who you are. \nFRANK Frank. \nJULIA's face registers horror and disbelief. \nJULIA No.  God no. \nFRANK Believe me.  It's me.  It's really me. \nJULIA What happened to you? \nFRANK His blood ... on the floor ... It brought me back. \nJULIA Back from where? \nFRANK Just help, will you?  Please God, help me - \nFrom downstairs, dimly, laughter. \n55   INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT \nLARRY has just told another story.  General drunken laughter.  KIRSTY stands up. \nSTEVE You're not going? \nKIRSTY Just upstairs. \nShe staggers a little bit. \nSTEVE Need any help? \nKIRSTY I AM house-trained. \nFurther hysteria. \nSTEVE (covered in embarrass- ment) No ... I meant ... \nLARRY It's round on the left - \nKIRSTY I know. \nShe steps out into the hallway. \n56   INT.   HALLWAY   NIGHT \nShe starts up the stairs.  She smiles to herself, thinking of STEVE. \n57   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT \nKIRSTY Yeah, there's room.  And there's Julia. \nSTEVE I see. \nKIRSTY She's so damn ... English. \nSTEVE Meaning what? \nKIRSTY Oh, I don't know.  Up-tight. Frigid. \nSTEVE stops walking. \nSTEVE I beg your pardon? \nKIRSTY (lightly) There ya go. (imitates his tone) I beg your pardon? \nSTEVE We're not all frigid. \nKIRSTY has turned to look at him.  Both of them are aware where the banter is leading; smiles play on their faces as they speak. \nKIRSTY Oh no? \nSTEVE Oh no. \nKIRSTY It's not what I heard. \nSTEVE (moves closer to her) Well you've just been talking to the wrong people. \nHe kisses her, with considerable feeling. \n62   INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT \nLARRY snores loudly.  JULIA lies beside him, wide awake, staring at the ceiling. \nLARRY turns over, muttering to himself. \n63   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT \nThe door opens.  JULIA is standing there, in her night-gown. \nFRANK raises his wretched head. \nFRANK Well? \nJULIA stares at the thing moving in the shadow. \nJULIA Yes. \n64   EXT.   NUMBER 55    DAY \nThe door opens.   JULIA steps out of the house, and starts towards the street.      As she does so, she glances round. \n65   EXT.   WINDOW OF TORTURE ROOM    DAY \nWe approach the window, knowing that FRANK watches behind it. \n66   EXT.   NUMBER 55   DAY \nJULIA heads off down the street. \n67   INT.   PIZZA RESTAURANT   DAY \nThe din of a lunchtime restaurant, with all the tables full, and everyone hungry.   In the middle of the melee, KIRSTY is valiantly trying to do six things at once.  Somebody wants their order taken;  somebody else wants more lager;  somebody else is complaining. She's doing her best, but losing the battle.  She serves a table with their food, and then starts back to pick up another order.   As she does so she's harangued from every side. \n1ST CUSTOMER Excuse me, Miss - \n2ND CUSTOMER I'd like some more lager. \n1ST CUSTOMER Miss! \nKIRSTY In a moment. \n2ND CUSTOMER Did you hear me? \nKIRSTY starts back to the counter.  As she does so somebody else's voice cuts through the din. \nSTEVE Hey, sex-bomb - \nShe wheels round. \nPRUDHOE You know it's not often I ... you know ... \nJULIA There's a first time for every- thing. \nPRUDHOE I suppose that's right. \nJULIA You want something to drink? \nPRUDHOE I'm already way over my usual limit.  You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years. \nHe approaches her:  his gestures made slightly clumsy by the alcohol he's drunk.  He kisses her.  She presses him off her. \nPRUDHOE Oh, come on. (he takes hold of her breast) It's what you brought me here for, isn't it? \nJULIA Yes.  I just think we'd be better off upstairs. \nPRUDHOE Oh.  Oh fine. \n72   INT.  TORTUPE ROOM    DAY \nFRANK's view, from the corner of the room.  We hear the sound of JULIA and PRUDHOE's approach up the stairs. \nPRUDHOE This your place? \nJULIA Let's not talk about it. \nPRUDHOE No personal details, right? \nJULIA Right. \nPRUDHOE You know, you're incredible - \nJULIA opens the door. \nJULIA Come on in.  Make yourself at home. \nShe steps inside.  PRUDHOE does as he's instructed.  He stares at the bare floor, as JULIA closes the door behind him. \nPRUDHOE There's no bed. \nJULIA That's right. \nPRUDHOE Huh? \nJULIA I prefer the floor. \nPRUDHOE First time for everything, right? \nJULIA Right. \nJULIA moves towards him \nJULIA Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm. \nPRUDHOE Yeah, why don't I? \nShe slips the knot of his tie.  We can hear her pulse on the soundtrack.  She glances over PRUDHOE's shoulder.  He follows her gaze, but she diverts him with a peck on the cheek. \nPRUDHOE (takes over his undressing) Why don't you do the same? \nJULIA Maybe I will. \nPRUDHOE, now starts to shed his jacket and trousers, trying not to take his eyes off JULIA for an instant. \nWe watch from FRANK'S P.O.V. as he drops his underwear. He still wears his shirt, which he starts to unbutton. We move back into a tighter shot. \nPRUDHOE (voice slightly slurred) You know, you're very beautiful. \nJULIA Am I? \nPRUDHOE You know you are.  Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on. \nJULIA smiles. \nPRUDHOE stops unbuttoning his shirt. \nPRUDHOE Oh Christ. \nJULIA What's wrong? \nThe thunder carries over to a dream. \nWe are in the Dining Room of Number 55, except that everything is once more shrounded in sheets. \nWe CUT to KIRSTY, moving through the room, her face pale, her hair glued to her forehead with sweat. \nSomewhere, a bell is ringing.  Flies buzz.  On the dinner table, a form is covered in a sheet.  It's clear that the shape is human.  She reaches the table, and looks at the body. \nSuddenly, blood begins to seep through the shroud, beginning at the head - eyes and mouth - then spreading across the body.  There are sobs beneath the shroud. \nShe reaches for it, to snatch it off the body. \nThe blood has almost turned the sheet scarlet. \nShe pulls. \nWe glimpse only a moment of what'd beneath: a naked body, scarlet and shining with blood from head to foot. \nShe screams. \nHer scream becomes louder, as we \nCUT TO \n88   INT.  KIRSTY'S ROOM    NIGHT \nSTEVE sits bolt upright in bed, while KIRSTY yells. \nThe sheet is snatched off him.  He looks across the room to see KIRSTY at the end of the bed, with the sheet in her hand. \nSTEVE What are you doing? \nKIRSTY's eyes are still closed. \nKirsty! \nHer eyes open.  She looks down at the sheet she's snatched from the bed, and drops it in horror. \nSTEVE Christ.  What was that about? \nKIRSTY, weak with fear, just shakes her head. \n89   INT.  HALLWAY, NUMBER 55    NIGHT \nA phone is ringing. \nLARRY crosses the hallway, bleary-eyed, and disappears from sight.   The phone is picked up. \nLARRY'S VOICE Hello? \n90   INT.  BEDROOM    NIGHT \nJULIA lies in bed, the pillow empty beside her.   She's wide awake, staring at the ceiling.   Downstairs, the murmur of LARRY's voice. \n91   INT.  TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT \nFRANK stands in the corner of the room, breathing softly in the shadows. \n92   INT.  TELEPHONE ROOM   NIGHT \nLARRY is on the phone. \nLARRY I'm O.K., honey.  It's all right ... \n93   INT.  KIRSTY'S ROOM    NIGHT \nKIRSTY is on the phone.   STEVE sits up in bed, having reclaimed the sheet. \nKIRSTY I just wanted to be sure you were O.K. \n94   INT.  TELEPHONE ROOM    NIGHT \nLARRY Never better.  You sleep well. \nKIRSTY (on phone) Yeah. \nLARRY I love you, honey. \nKIRSTY (on phone) I love you too. \nJULIA So they cheated you \nIn the lacquer we see oiled bodies moving.  It's difficult to be sure what the forms signify.  Is this torture, or some elaborate pleasure? \nFRANK Oh no.  They kept to their bargain.  They gave me experiences I'd never forget ... \nThe images in the lacquer are becoming clearer, and they are APPALLING.  Flesh torn open; blood running across sweating flesh; hooks, and terrible machines. \nFRANK But their pleasure was my pain. \nHis voice has begun to tremble.  The images in the box are more horrific by the moment.  And flowing between them, highly distorted, the CENOBITE's faces, and that of FRANK, screaming and screaming. \nFRANK Terrible pain.  Appalling ... \nHe can't speak for a moment.  After a pause, he goes on, his voice heavy. \nMy body was forfeit.  But my spirit ... they left that here. In the boards.  In the walls. Watching the world, but never able to touch it ... \nJULIA And the blood let you out? \nFRANK There are ways to resurrection. Blood's one of them.  I won't let them take me back, Julia. \nJULIA looks at the horrors in the box, and understands his desire. \nFRANK I want to be whole, and then get out - \nHe lifts the box up. \nI won't let them take me. \nJULIA You won't have to.  We'll be gone.  Somewhere they'll never find us. \nThere's a rumble of thunder. \nNot in the whole wide world. \n102  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT \nMore thunder, and the sound of heavy rain against the windows. \nThe television is on.  LARRY and JULIA are sitting on the couch.  LARRY is watching a boxing match.  He has consumed several beers:  the cans are beside his feet; and there's another in his hand. \nJULIA reads a magazine, glancing up at the screen to see the match getting more heated.  Blood is starting to flow. \nLARRY Is this upsetting you? \nJULIA I've seen worse. \nLARRY looks at her. \nLARRY Are you all right? \nJULIA Fine. \nLARRY Only I'll turn it off - \nThere's a sudden raising of shouts from the screen, as one of the boxers hits the canvas.  LARRY turns his attention back to the match. \nCOMMENTATOR And he's down!  He's down! \nThe thunder rolls on. \n103  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT \nThe lightning finds its way through the holes in the newspaper.  FRANK is watching through the window, his face occasionally washed with light.  His hand, on the window frame, taps out the same tattoo he's tapped out before.  He turns away from the window, and his foot catches the box.  It rolls across the floor. \n104  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT \nThe boxing match is heating up again. \nCOMMENTATOR - and now he's in trouble, he's really in trouble - \nLARRY What was that? \nJULIA looks up from her magazine. \nJULIA Thunder. \nThe violence on the screen is horrific, as swollen faces burst beneath punches. \nHe kisses her, much harder this time; a sexual kiss. \nLet's go  down.  I'll make it better. \nHe kisses her again. \n108  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT \nA shadow moves across the screen as the door opens, and LARRY puts on the light. He has hold of JULIA's hand.  He leads her inside.  She sits on the bed, illuminated by the light from the landing, and the occasional flicker from the window.  LARRY kneels between her legs, and kisses her breasts, his eyes closed. \nJULIA glances into the shadows of the room.  She senses FRANK's presence. \nLARRY ... oh babe ... \nHe starts to unbutton her dress.  She's distracted by her suspicions; he has his hands against her almost before she realizes what's happening. \nWe have her P.O.V. as she looks around the room.  The dressing table; the wardrobe; the curtains at the window.  Does something move in the shadows? \nA flash of lightning.  No.  There's nothing. \nLARRY gets onto the bed and draws her against him, kissing her.  This is not the intense, slightly dangerous love-making she experienced with FRANK, but a fumbling, slightly foolish exchange.  LARRY is so wrapped in attempting to make the right moves he doesn't register the fact that JULIA's attention is elsewhere. \nNow we have a P.O.V. from the far side of the room, of the two figures on the bed, the only sound the thunder and LARRY's murmured words of seduction, which we can barely make out. \nLARRY ...I love you, honey ... let me ... oh God ... I love you ... \nNeither of them have undressed fully; there's just a tangle of clothes around them which removes any trace of eroticism from the scene. \nA CLOSE UP of JULIA's head, laid on the pillow, shows just how uninvolved she is - while LARRY works, eyes closed.  JULIA looks down the length of her husband's body.  The door of the wardrobe swings open.  FRANK is watching.  She registers horror.  LARRY is oblivious to all of this, of course. \nWe have a CLOSE UP of FRANK watching the love-making. Now he steps out of the wardrobe.  JULIA makes a moan of horror, which LARRY takes as enthusiasm. \nLARRY Oh baby ... I love you ... \nFrom JULIA'S P.O.V., we see the form of FRANK shamble towards the lovers. \nFrom FRANK'S P.O.V. we see the lovers on the bed, LARRY's back vunerable.  JULIA seems to realize what he intends. \nJULIA ... no ... \nLARRY barely hears her. \nFRANK is at the very end of the bed now, and JULIA becomes highly agitated. \nJULIA No.  No, you mustn't.  PLEASE. No. \nLARRY stops his love-making. \nLARRY (looks at her) Huh? \nJULIA Please ... \nLARRY What's wrong with you? \nJULIA (almost sobbing) Please.  I can't bear it ... \nLARRY is angered and utterly perplexed at this.  He disengages his arms from around her. \nJULIA'S P.O.V., as FRANK retreats. \nLARRY rolls off JULIA. \nThe wardrobe door closes.  Click. \nLARRY I don't understand you.  One moment you're all over me, the next it's:  Don't touch me. \nHe sits on the edge of the bed. \nI just don't understand. \nHe gets up and leaves the bedroom.  JULIA remains where she is.  We have a shot of the bed, and her upon it, from FRANK's end of the room.  She stares at the wardrobe.  Through the crack of the open door, FRANK stares back.  A flicker of lightning illuminates his face; his skeletal grin. \nSoftly, beneath the assault of the rain on the roof, we hear laughter. \n109  INT.   A SMALL RESTAURANT   EVENING \nKIRSTY and LARRY are sitting eating a meal together, in an intimate restaurant.  LARRY has little appetite, to judge by his plate.  He looks as if he hasn't slept for several nights.  KIRSTY, by contrast, is sparkling \nLARRY ... maybe we should never have come back. \nFrom the top of the stairs we watch JULIA lead SYKES upstairs. \nSYKES I get lonely sometimes. \nJULIA Everybody does. \n117  EXT.   STREET   DAY \nKIRSTY starts towards the house. \n118  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY \nIn the corner of the room FRANK stands, tapping out the rhythm with his fingers.  It's 'Colonel Bogey', and now he hums it too.  Outside the door, a footfall. \nJULIA Come in. \nThe humming stops. \nJULIA opens the door. \n119  EXT.   FRONT OF HOUSE   DAY \nKIRSTY starts down the path. \n120  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY \nSYKES is looking at JULIA. \nSYKES What is this?  A game? \nFRANK moves in the corner.  SYKES catches the motion from the corner of his eye.  He turns. \nWhat ? \nFRANK steps from the shadows. \nJesus Christ. \nJULIA hits him with the hammer. \n121  EXT.   DOORSTEP   DAY \nKIRSTY hears SYKES scream.  She freezes.  Then steps back from the doorstep and looks up at the house. \n122  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY \nIn the Room, pandemonium.  SYKES, blood pouring down his face, flails out at JULIA.  The hammer flies from her hand.  He lunges for the door, but she manages to kick it closed. \nSYKES Christ help me! \n123  EXT.   HOUSE   DAY \nKIRSTY makes her way around the back of the house. \n124  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY \nSYKES has taken hold of JULIA, and is using her as a shield against FRANK, whos is bearing down upon him.  For the first time we see FRANK's true colours where JULIA's concerned - \nSYKES (to Frank) Don't! \nCasually, FRANK throws JULIA aside.  She falls, sobbing. \nFRANK descends on SYKES. \nSYKES No! \n125  INT.   KITCHEN   DAY \nSYKES' scream covers the sound of KIRSTY forcing the back door open.  She steps inside. \n126  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY \nFRANK has SYKES face to the wall.  SYKES is sobbing now. The room is covered in blood. \nFRANK (to Julia) Get out of here. \nShe picks herself up. \nSYKES (to Julia) Please ... don't let him kill me ... please ... \nFRANK There's very little I can do about it. \nJULIA Maybe we should just leave - \nFRANK Like this?  Look at me! LIKE THIS? \nJULIA Well we can't just stay here - \nFRANK I need a skin.  Then we leave - \n143  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT \nKIRSTY is sitting up in bed.  On the bedside table, a telephone.  She is now thoroughly engrossed in the problems of the box.  Her fingers speed over the surfaces, looking for some way in, testing its strength. \nSuddenly, a click.  Her face lights up with pleasure, as she slides a part of the box open, revealing new intricacies.  And to accompany the revelation, a tinkling tune. \nShe smiles.  It's a musical box. \nThe light beside the bed flickers, but she doesn't notice. \nThe door opens.  It's the NURSE. \nNURSE Comfortable? \nKIRSTY (smiles) Sure. \nNURSE Any luck with your father? \nKIRSTY (shakes her head) He's probably got a meeting. I called a friend of mine.  He's coming; is that O.K.? \nNURSE Of course. \nThe NURSE exits.  As she does go the light flickers again. The box clicks.  A new facet is revealed ... \nKIRSTY smiles. \n144  EXT.   NUMBER 55   NIGHT \nThe front door closes. \nLARRY (inside) Julia? \n145  INT.   HALLWAY   NIGHT \nLARRY stands in the hall.  JULIA comes down the stairs. She looks pale; even ill. \nLARRY What's wrong? \nJULIA I don't know where to begin ... \nLARRY What are you talking about? \nJULIA It's better you see for your- self - \nShe turns and starts up the stairs.  He follows. \n146  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT \nKIRSTY has opened more of the box.  The tune is more complex now. \nSomewhere a bell has started to ring.  Now, she works the final mechanism of the box.  The bedside light flickers and goes out. \nThe bell rings.  Light pours out of the box.  She drops it, shocked. \nThe bedside light comes on again. \nShe looks up. \nIn the wall opposite the end of her bed, a very narrow doorway has simply opened in the wall. \nLeaving the box on the bed, she gets up and goes to the gap.  As she approaches she hears the distant, rhythmical sob of a baby.  She stands at the doorway. \n147  INT.   CORRIDOR TO HELL   NIGHT \nWe look back at her, a diminutive figure framed against a shot of light, from way, way down the corridor. \n148  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT \nThe sobbing goes on.  KIRSTY stares down the corridor - which is lit brightly in some places, and is absolutely dark in others - not certain of whether to venture down it or not. \nKIRSTY This isn't for real. \nCENOBITE You solved the box.  We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures. \nThe chattering CENOBITE steps towards her. \nKIRSTY Don't touch me! \nThe door opens.  It's STEVE. \nKIRSTY's face floods with relief.  STEVE does not register the CENOBITES' presence however. \nKIRSTY Steve.  Thank God you came. \nSTEVE What happened to you? \nHe steps between the CENOBITES. \nKIRSTY These THINGS ... they want to take me - \nSTEVE What things? \nCENOBITE (to Kirsty) He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty.  And you to us. \nKIRSTY No! \nSTEVE What's wrong? \nKIRSTY Don't let them take me, Steve - \nSTEVE I won't let anybody take you. \nHe starts to walk towards her, but the creature in the dark glasses takes a hooked rod from its back and puts the hook to STEVE's neck.   STEVE's hand moves to the place; he makes a small sound of pain. The CENOBITE takes off its glasses, to see its trick better.  The eyes beneath are sewn shut.  It pulls a little more on the hook. STEVE winces. \nFEMALE CENOBITE If he takes another step, we open his throat. \nKIRSTY (to Steve) Please go, Steve. \nSTEVE What? \nKIRSTY Just go.  PLEASE.  I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad.  He'll look after me - \nSTEVE (protesting) What did I say? \nKIRSTY Will you GO, damn you? \nMystified, STEVE retreats a step. \nSTEVE I'll come back later, huh? \nKIRSTY Sure.  Why not? \nStill puzzled, STEVE crosses to the door. \nSTEVE 'Bye. \nKIRSTY 'Bye. \nFEMALE CENOBITE Good. \nCENOBITE It's time we were away. \nKIRSTY (almost crying) Let me alone, will you? \nCENOBITE No tears please.  It's a waste of good suffering. \nThe chatterer comes for her.  As it does so desperation brings a plan to KIRSTY's head. \nKIRSTY Wait! \nHe stops. \nCENOBITE No time for argument. \nKIRSTY You did this before, right? \nCENOBITE Many times. \nKIRSTY To a man called Frank Cotton? \n160  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT \nKIRSTY turns the corner of the street, and starts down it.  The wind is strong now.  It is full of sibilant whispers, hurrying her along. \n161  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT \nJULIA dresses. \n162  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT \nKIRSTY reaches the doorstep.  As she does so the whispers die away completely.   She beats on the door.   No reply. She beats again, more urgently. \nKIRSTY Please!   Dad!   It's me! It's Kirsty! \n163  INT.   LANDING   NIGHT \nJULIA steps onto the landing.  We can hear KIRSTY shouting on the step. \nJULIA Damn her. \nWe hear a voice, off-screen.  Is it FRANK or LARRY? Impossible to be sure. \nVOICE Answer it. \n164  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT \nKIRSTY still beats on the door. \nKIRSTY Please, answer me!  Please - \nThe door is suddenly opened.  JULIA is standing there. \nJULIA Kirsty?   It's very late. \nKIRSTY Where's Daddy? \nJULIA What's the problem? \nKIRSTY (stepping inside) I have to see my father. \nJULIA Of course.  There's no need to shout. \n165  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT \nWe pan across the table.  At the end of the table sits LARRY.  The light is behind him.  His features are shadowy.  But we can see that he is badly bruised. \nWe hear the womens' voices, off-screen. \nJULIA You look terrible.  Have you had an accident? \nKIRSTY I was here this afternoon. \nJULIA This afternoon. \nKIRSTY I saw everything. \nJULIA I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see? \nKIRSTY doesn't answer, but walks through into the Dining Room.  KIRSTY sees LARRY at the table. \nKIRSTY Oh God.  Thank God. (she starts to sob) I thought something might have ... \nShe glances round at JULIA, who has also entered. (to Larry) I have to talk to you. \nLARRY Of course. \nLARRY leans forward, and into the pool of light over the table.  He looks much the worse for wear.  His flesh is raw and bruised.  There is blood at his neck and hairline. \nLARRY It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right ... \nKIRSTY No.  You don't understand. Your brother - Frank - he's here in the house.  And he's - \nLARRY Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now. \nKIRSTY Finished? \nLARRY (smiles) He's gone. \nKIRSTY Gone? \nFRANK What's going on? \nLight begins to pour through the walls of the room. \nNo. \nHe starts towards the door.  But he's too late.  The CENOBITES are standing in his way.  He backs off from them. \nCENOBITE Frank - \nKIRSTY (to Cenobite) What took you so long? \nFEMALE CENOBITE We had to hear it from his own lips - \nFRANK turns on KIRSTY. \nFRANK You set me up!   You bitch. You set me up! \nThe pattern of light in the room has become more elaborate, and the CENOBITES move through it towards FRANK. \nCENOBITE (to Kirsty) This isn't for your eyes. \nKIRSTY crosses towards the door.  As she reaches for the handle she hears FRANK roar behind her.  She turns.   He breaks between the CENOBITES, knife in hand, but as he comes within striking distance the air is full of whining sounds and he stops dead. \nThey have their hooks in him, we see.  In his arms and legs;  in his back and sides;  in his scalp and neck and temples.   Hooks attached to countless chains, which arrest his progress.  They plough through his flesh as he strives to reach her.  But at a gesture from the leader of the CENOBITES, the chains are hauled in.  He flings back his head, yelling.   The knife drops from his hand. \nCENOBITE (to Kirsty) Out! \nShe turns back to the door and opens it.  FRANK is hauled back towards the centre of the room. \nFRANK Bitch! \nThe house is growling  from basement to eaves now, as KIRSTY steps onto the landing. \n180  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT \nBehind her, FRANK howls. \nShe looks back. \nThey have him IN EXTREMIS,    his body spread-eagled; hooks in a hundred places, pulling at his flesh.  He fights like a wild animal, snarling and cursing.  They pull the chains tighter. \n181  INT.  TORTURE ROOM    NIGHT \nA close up of FRANK's face.   He suddenly stops fighting. He raises his head, his eyes staring up at KIRSTY from beneath a bleeding, sweating brow.  He flicks his tongue over his bloodied lips. \nThen - \n- he comes apart. \n182  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT \nThe door slams as FRANK's body is torn apart in a welter of blood and flesh fragments. \nSomething heavy thuds against the door. \nKIRSTY turns and starts down the stairs. \n183  INT.  STAIRS    NIGHT \nAs she reaches the place where STEVE is half-sitting, half- lying, the house starts to growl as though its foundations are about to give way.  STEVE's nose is bleeding, and his face is bruised, but he's conscious. \nKIRSTY We have to get out of here. They'll kill us for the fun of it. \nSTEVE staggers to his feet.   KIRSTY picks up the box, which is on the lower landing. As she picks it up, the FEMALE CENOBITE steps from the shadows. \nFEMALE CENOBITE Don't leave us yet - \nKIRSTY starts to try and manipulate the box in her hands. \nFEMALE CENOBITE We've got such sights to show you - \nKIRSTY manages to slot one of the pieces of the box back into place. \nFEMALE CENOBITE ... don't ... \nHer voice becomes a howl, and she's sucked away into darkness. \nSTEVE (behind Kirsty) Jesus Christ. \n", "test1_input": "Come here, damn you.  I want to touch you ... \nStill she doesn't move. \nFRANK (more softly) Come to Daddy.  I only want to touch ... \nShe takes a step towards his outstretched arm.   His fingers touch her face.  She steels herself against them. Now, he starts to trace the line of her jaw, stroking her.  Now her lips, caressingly. \nSuddenly, a sound from downstairs.  The front door is opened. \nLARRY (from below) Sweetheart? \nJULIA withdraws from his touch \nLARRY (from below) Where are you? \n77   INT.  HALLWAY    DAY \nShot from the stairs of LARRY.  He looks up the flight. He takes a step towards the stairs. \n78   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY \nJULIA takes a step backwards, her foot hitting PRUDHOE's corpse. \n79   INT.  HALLWAY   DAY \nLARRY is still at the bottom of the stairs. \nLARRY Are you there? \nFor a moment it looks as though he's going to climb the stairs, then he thinks better of it, and goes through to the back of the house. \n80   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY \nJULIA has wrapped the corpse of PRUDHOE up in its clothes and is now lifting it.  The body is lighter now, having been drained of nourishment.  Its head lolls back and its dentures drop out, hitting the floor loudly.  She freezes. No sound from below.  She backs out of the room with her burden. \nFRANK's arm reaches for the fallen dentures and peers at them. \nFRANK Who's a pretty boy then? \nSoft laughter from the darkness. \n81   INT.  JUNK ROOM    DAY \nJULIA pushes the door of the Junk Room, which is on the upper landing, open.  Inside, a chaos of tea-chests and bric-a-brac.  She lays the body down. \n82   INT.  KITCHEN    DAY \nLARRY has come through to look for JULIA.  He hears a noise above.   He looks up. \nLARRY (quietly) Julia? \nHe leaves the kitchen. \n83   INT.  HALLWAY     DAY \nAgain, LARRY Steps into the hallway, and gazes up the stairs. \nLARRY Are you there? \nHe starts up. \n84   INT.  LOWER LANDING    DAY \nJULIA steps into the bathroom, and then locks the door behind her. \nLARRY ascends to the top of the stairs. \nLARRY Julia? \nJULIA (from bathroom) I'm here. \nLARRY (at the door) Sweetheart ... I've been calling you. \nHe tries the door.  It's locked. \nAre you all right? \nJULIA Just feeling a bit sick. \n", "test1_true": "85   INT.  BATHROOM    DAY \nJULIA, still trembling, sits on the edge of the bath. \nJULIA I'll be O.K.  Just leave me be a while. \nLARRY Can I get you anything? \nJULIA Maybe a brandy. \nLARRY Sure. \nJULIA I'll be down in a minute \nLARRY O.K. \nShe listens as his footsteps recede down the landing and stairs.    Then she crosses to the mirror and tries to erase the signs of panic.  She puts a comb through her hair, and adjusts her blouse.  That done, she unbolts the door and steps out into the landing.  She doesn't go down however, but UP,  back to the Torture Room. \n86   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY \nShe opens the door. \nJULIA (very softly) Frank? \nA crunching sound in the shadows.  FRANK's hand opens, dropping the pieces of PRUDHOE's dentures, which he has crushed, onto the floor, in a rain of plastic teeth. \nFRANK I'm hurting \nJULIA Hurting. \nFRANK My nerves ... are beginning to work again. \nJULIA Good. \nFRANK One more.  Maybe two - \nJULIA's face registers no horrer at this. \n- to heal me completely.   Then we can be away from here, before they come looking. \nJULIA Who? \nFRANK The Cenobites.  It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here. \nFrom downstairs, LARRY. \nLARRY Julia?   Are you all right? \nJULIA crosses to the door and calls down. \nJULIA Just a moment.  Put on some music will you babe? \nLARRY O.K. \nShe returns to her conversation with FRANK. \nFRANK Poor Larry.  Obedient as ever. \nJULIA Keep your voice down. \nShe crosses to close the door.   When she turns round, he's in front of her, silhouetted against the window, his half-formed face terrifying in the gloom.  Suddenly he reaches out and catches hold of her arm.  She gasps in pain. \nFRANK Ssh. Don't want babe to hear. \nJULIA You're hurting. \nFRANK You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me.  Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before.  We belong to each other now, for better or worse ... \nHe lets go of her. \n... like love.  Only real. \nShe goes to the door, and leaves him, locking it behind her. \nWe move close to FRANK's face.   He licks his skinned lips with a bloody tongue.  Thunder rolls. \n87   KIRSTY'S DREAM \n", "test1_id": 1503, "test2_input": "FRANK has closed in on her by now.  He Lakes hold of her face. \nFRANK I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you?  Beautiful. \nKIRSTY This isn't happening. \nFRANK I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain.  But why kid yourself?  Some things have to be endured.  Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter ... \nAs he leans in to kiss her she snatches hold of the pus and bloodstained shirt that's glued to his abdomen, and PULLS.  There's a flow of fluids. FRANK's head is thrown back, and he screams. She slips from beneath his grasp.  But he's after her in a moment, his hand catching her blouse.  It tears.  His fingers rake her bare skin. \nShe stumbles, reaches out for the wall, which is slick with SYKES' blood.  Her hand slides over it.  She falls, heavily. \nRoaring, FRANK comes in pursuit of her. \nOn the floor in front of KIRSTY:  the box.  It's a poor weapon, but it's all she's got.  As he comes after her again, she stands up and delivers a blow to his head with the box.  He howls.  She races for the door.  But he's after her.  He strikes her. She's thrown against the wall.  He's FURIOUS now. Strikes her again.  She cannot survive much more. \nShe raises the box to retaliate.   FRANK sees what she's holding.  His  attack stops. \nFRANK Give that to me. \nShe dimly realizes that she has a bargaining tool. \nKIRSTY (breathless) No. \nFRANK One last time.  Give me the box. \nKIRSTY You want it? \nThe monster's eyes glitter. \nFucking have it! \nShe throws the box.  It sails past FRANK and smashes through the window. \nFRANK NO! \nHe goes to the window.  She takes her chance.  She's out of the door in a moment. \nNO! \n136  INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY \nKIRSTY propels herself out of the Room, and down the stairs, while FRANK vents his anger above her. \n137  INT.   HALLWAY   DAY \nShe flings open the front door, and pitches herself - bleeding and bruised - into the daylight beyond. \n138  EXT.   NUMBER 55   DAY \nAs she stumbles away down the path, she sees the box at her feet, in a litter of broken glass.  She picks it up, and continues to run. \n139  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   DAY \nA series of shots from KIRSTY'S P.O.V., as she staggers along the street.  The sound-track whines; the image threatens to be eclipsed by darkness.  People stare at her as she runs.  A child points. \nFinally, the CAMERA slows.  She stands still. \nA voice, off camera: \nVOICE (O.S.) Are you all right? \nThe CAMERA swings giddily around in the direction of the speaker.  A WOMAN comes into view. \nWOMAN Do you need any help? \nAs she speaks, the picture fades to white. \n140  KIRSTY'S DREAM  (PART TWO) \nThe whiteness continues to fill the screen.  Distant, incoherent voices are heard, and the thump of blood in the inner ear. \nThen darkness seeps into the whiteness, patterns like Rorschach inkblots: ambiguous, yet interpretable as sexual or horrific imagery.  With the darkness, soaking over the scene like blood through the sheet in her first dream, fragments of FRANK's previous dialogue. \nFRANK Come to Daddy. \nKIRSTY This isn't happening. \nFRANK Some things have to be endured ... \n", "test2_true": "... take it from me ... \nNow, total darkness. \n... Come to Daddy ... \nAnd suddenly, she wakes. \n141  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT \nKIRSTY is lying in a bed in a private room.  A NURSE is at her bedside, monitoring her condition. \nNURSE You're awake. \nShe goes to the door. \nI'll get the doctor. \nShe exits. \nKIRSTY tries to sit up.  Her head hurts, badly.  As she achieves a sitting position, the door opens.  The NURSE returns, with a DOCTOR. \nDOCTOR (approaching the bed) So ... you're back with us. \nKIRSTY I think so. \nDOCTOR How are you feeling? \nKIRSTY Tender. \nDOCTOR You took quite a beating.  Do you remember what happened? \nShe looks at him, uncertain of where to start. \nKIRSTY I want to speak to my father ... \nDOCTOR (nods) Of course.  We'll bring you a telephone. \nThe NURSE exits.  The DOCTOR brings the box from his pocket. \nMaybe this'll jog your memory. \nHe lays it on the bed.  She stares at it, her expression betraying nothing. \nI had the Devil's own job getting it out of your hand. Does it ring any bells? \nShe shakes her head. \nDo you want it left? \nKIRSTY Why not? \nHe offers her a reassuring smile. \nDOCTOR Chin up.  There's no serious damage.  And you're safe here. \nKIRSTY Um. \nHe leaves the room. \nKIRSTY picks up the box, tentatively.  She turns it over in her hand, examining it. \n142  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT \nFRANK is standing in the shadows.  He is wearing a fresh shirt.  He smirks.   JULIA watches him. \nDownstairs, the telephone rings.  JULIA is very nervous now; desperate even. \nJULIA She'll tell them everything ... \nFRANK I don't think so.  She'll want Larry first. \nJULIA That's probably her now.  Or the police. \nFRANK Maybe. \nJULIA Don't you care? \n", "test2_id": 1504, "test3_input": "LARRY Come to Daddy. \nHer gaze moves up to JULIA, who is on the stairs. \nJULIA No, damn you - \n169  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT \nKIRSTY (mouths) Oh my God. \nEverything is slowing down.  The bells and the thunder fill the soundtrack. \nLARRY smiles, as KIRSTY moves towards him.  Tears have begun to fill her eyes.   She searches for him.  His smile decays as he realizes her objective.   Her nails rake his cheek.   The flesh puckers, and tears along the brow.   Blood flows.   The mask of stolen flesh he wears slips a little, and FRANK's twisted features come into view. \nJULIA Frank! \nKIRSTY screams, as FRANK lunges for her.  The lights in the hallway flicker, and threaten to go out. \nKIRSTY avoids FRANK's blow, but in doing so allows him to get between her and the front door.  She's trapped. His torn face flapping, he opens his jacket (the interior of which is blood-stained) and pulls a knife from the lining. \nSuddenly, JULIA is behind her, gripping hold of her hair. \nFRANK advances on KIRSTY, but in the last moment before the fatal stab KIRSTY twists, avoiding the blow.  JULIA shrieks and stumbles forward, the knife gleaming as it's buried to the hilt in her side. \nKIRSTY slips from between them.  JULIA collapses into FRANK's arms.   He holds her up. \nKIRSTY makes a dive for the front door, but FRANK lets JULIA slip and intercepts KIRSTY.  JULIA falls back against the wall, dying.  KIRSTY retreats to the bottom of the stairs.  FRANK follows. \nFRANK You're not leaving now - \nAs he follows, JULIA reaches out and takes hold of his sleeve. \nKIRSTY flees the only route she can, upstairs.  The house is creaking in every board and rafter now. \nFRANK turns on JULIA, trapping her against the wall., \nJULIA Help me, Frank. For God's sake. \nHe puts his hands around her neck, and leans towards her.  At the last moment she seems to understand that he intends not to kiss her but to steal what little life she has left. \nJULIA No, Frank - \nFrom the stairs KIRSTY glimpses him battering upon her. \nThen she looks away, and runs up the stairs. \nWhen we look back JULIA is withering in FRANK's arms. \n170  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT \nThe landing is smoky.  The lights have taken on a yellowish tinge.  The air is full of moans. \nKIRSTY is desperate for a hiding place.   She tries one of the doors, but it's locked.   She opens another, and the din of birds' wings gets louder. \n171  INT.  BIRD ROOM    NIGHT \nA P.O.V. shot, lunging towards KIRSTY in the doorway. She slams the door in the face of whatever's coming for her. \n172  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT \nFRANK hears the door slam.   He drops JULIA to the ground.  She's dead, her flesh rotting on her face. \nFRANK starts to climb the stairs, his eyes burning with hunger. \n173  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT \nKIRSTY is cornered.   From below, FRANK's voice. \nFRANK Where are you, beautiful? \nKIRSTY starts up the second flight of stairs, as FRANK's shadow is thrown up on the wall below. \n174  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT \nKIRSTY is faced with a choice.  The Torture Room door is open, but the skinned body is in there, so instead she heads for the Junk Room, and opens the door. \n175  INT.  JUNK ROOM    NIGHT \nMoonlight falls through the window, illuminating a chaos of furniture and boxes.  She crosses to the window, and tries to get it open.   It won't budge. \n", "test3_true": "She looks around for a lever to open the window with - \n176  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT \nFRANK reaches the landing and opens the bedroom door, calling for her. Then he starts up the last flight of stairs. \nFRANK Come to Daddy. \n177  INT.  JUNK ROOM   NIGHT \nKIRSTY lifts a cloth off one of the boxes. \nStaring up from the box is the corpse of PRUDHOE, his eyes and mouth open in a silent shriek. \nShe reels back from the box, terrified, backing into the shadows. \nAn arm reaches for her, taking hold of her and dragging her back into darkness as the door opens.  FRANK stands on the theshold.   His breath is thick.  He shambles forward, but he doesn't see her. \nWe CUT back to the shadows.  KIRSTY's eyes are wild with terror. \nBack to the door, which clicks closed. \nKIRSTY breaks cover, and so does her saviour.  It's STEVE.  He is sweating with terror. \nKIRSTY (a whisper) What are you doing here? \nSTEVE Got in downstairs.  Looking for you.  What's going on? \nShe shakes her head.   STEVE brings the box from his jacket. \nSTEVE You forgot something - \nShe doesn't see what he's produced.  She's already moving to the door.  She listens. \n178  INT.  UPPER LANDING   NIGHT \nThe landing is empty.   The door of the Junk Room opens. \nKIRSTY steps out. \nThe house is strangely still.  The lights swing a little; but otherwise ... nothing.  She advances along the passageway.  STEVE follows.  They reach the top of the stairs in safety. \nSTEVE (signalled more than spoken) I'll go first - \nAs he speaks, FRANK steps out of the Torture Room, knife in hand. \nRoaring, he comes at them both.  KIRSTY flings herself out of the path of the knife.  FRANK swipes at STEVE, who falls backwards down the stairs.   He cries out, head hitting the stairs as he descends. \nThe box falls from his unconscious hand. \nFRANK turns on KIRSTY, who avoids one slice of the knife, and another, but is driven back into the Torture Room. \n179  INT.  TORTURE ROOM    NIGHT \nHe's after her in a flash. \nShe falls beside her father's body, her eyes meeting its skinned face. \nKIRSTY God - \nFRANK Don't cry for him.  He's dead. He always was. \nKIRSTY has been pushed to the limits of her endurance. She can be terrorized and pursued no longer.  Death looks an easy option by comparison with more of FRANK's horrors. \nKIRSTY Go on.   Kill me.  I don't care. \nFRANK Poor baby. \nKIRSTY You bastard \nFRANK Hush now.   It's all right. Frank's here. \nKIRSTY Frank. \nFRANK That's right.  Are you losing your mind, baby?  This is Frank you're talking to.  FRANK. \nAs he speaks the bell begins tolling again.  FRANK looks puzzled. \n", "test3_id": 1505}

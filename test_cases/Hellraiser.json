{"test1_input": "LARRY Julia's my second wife. \n2ND MAN (weakly) Lucky man. \nLARRY Damn right.  Now are we going to move the bed or not? \n28   INT.   KITCHEN   DAY \nThe kitchen is chaotic.  Cutlery, crockery, utensils, pans and foodstuffs have been heaped on every available surface.  KIRSTY has found the kettle, but is having difficulty turning on the tap.  She struggles with it.  No joy.  Just a rattling sound in the pipes as the system lurches into action. \n29   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY \nThe pipes rattle and chug behind the plaster.  The CAMERA moves along the corridor, hugging the wall. At the end of the corridor stands JULIA, in a patch of sunlight.  She has the photograph of FRANK in her hands. \nShe looks intently at it. \nA CLOSE-UP of the photograph.  Then FRANK's voice. \nFRANK Can I come in? \nJULIA looks up from the photograph. \n30   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY \nA front door opens.  On the step of another house stands FRANK, with two suitcases.  It's raining outside; HARD.  The rain has plastered his hair to his scalp, which only emphasizes his raw good looks. He's unshaven; his eyes are dark, and intense. Again, the line she remembers: \nFRANK Can I come in? \nThe splash of rain on the step becomes a spurt of water, as we \nCUT BACK TO \nthe present day. \n31   INT.   KITCHEN   DAY \nThe tap has come on suddenly, spraying KIRSTY with water.  She jumps back, soaked. \nKIRSTY Shit!  Shit! \nShe reaches to turn the pressure down. \n32   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY \nThe men are struggling with the bed again. \nLARRY (calls through) Are you O.K.? \nKIRSTY (from kitchen) Sure. \n33   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY \nAgain, JULIA returns her gaze to the photograph. \n34   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY \nThe same scene:  FRANK in the doorstep.  Now we \nCUT TO \nthe person who opened the door.  It's JULIA; a younger JULIA, her hair arranged differently, her clothes brighter.  It is two weeks before her marriage to LARRY.  She looks at the man on the doorstep without a trace of recognition on her face. \nFRANK You're Julia, right? \nJULIA That's right.  Who are you? \nFRANK (a dazzling smile) I'm brother Frank. \nJULIA (smiles) Oh. \nFRANK I came for the wedding. \nHe looks at her, eyes glittering.  His hold on her is almost mesmeric. \nThere is going to BE a wedding? \nJULIA Oh.  Oh yes. \nFRANK Well can I come in or not? \n", "test1_true": "He steps inside.  Now he is close to her, rain running down his face.  We can hear his breath; sense the almost intimidating intimacy of his presence. \nFRANK That's nice to know. (pause) Have you got a towel? \n35   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY \nJULIA stares down at the photograph.  Off scrren, KIRSTY's voice: \nKIRSTY (O.S.) Have you got a towel? \nJULIA looks up.  At the top of the stairs, KIRSTY soaked from the tap.  JULIA looks up, and hurriedly pockets the photograph. \nJULIA Kirsty. \nKIRSTY Hi.  I got soaked. \nJULIA There's a towel in the bath- room. \nKIRSTY Which is where? \nJULIA Just to your left. \nKIRSTY ducks into the bathroom.  We \nCUT BACK TO \nJULIA.  It's clear the memory of her first meeting with FRANK has affected her deeply.  The tears that threatened earlier are close. \n36   INT.   BATHROOM   DAY \nKIRSTY has unbuttoned her blouse and is drying herself. \nKIRSTY Did Dad tell you I got a room, by the way?  Waterloo.  Centre of the known universe. \nSilence from outside. \nJulia? \n(she puts her head out of the bathroom) \n37   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY \nJULIA has gone. \n38   INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY \nThe door of the Torture Room is pushed open.  JULIA steps inside. \n39   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY \nKIRSTY hears the creak of footsteps on the boards above.  JULIA's behaviour puzzles her, but she's not about to waste time thinking too hard about it. She starts downstairs again. \n40   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY \nWe have an odd, hovering point of view of JULIA, as she steps inside the room.  Something about the atmosphere distresses her. \nThere is a scratching sound.  She looks down.  A wood-louse, recalling Frank's foresaken bed, crawls along the edge of the skirting board.  She crosses to the window, and tears away a little spy-hole in the aged newspaper. \nFrom downstairs, the voices of the bed-movers. \n1ST MAN Have you got it? \n2ND MAN I've got it.  I told you - \nLARRY Wait!  Wait! \nThe light through the window falls on her eye. The screen becomes a white-out, from which emerges: \n41   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY \nA bedroom, with afternoon sunlight pouring between the slats of bamboo blinds.  Outside we can hear children playing summer games.  Inside, a fly buzzes. \nJULIA, the younger self, is holding her wedding dress in front of her, displaying it. \nJULIA Well? \nFRANK (0.S.) I don't want to see the dress. \n", "test1_id": 1503, "test2_input": "JULIA Take it slowly. \nLARRY So damn stupid. \nJULIA You're done worse. \nLARRY I'll be scarred for life. \nJULIA No you won't. \n50   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY \nKIRSTY is half way up the stairs, as JULIA and LARRY head down. \nKIRSTY What happened? \nJULIA Just an accident.  He's all right.  Will you drive?  He needs stitches. \nKIRSTY Sure. \nJULIA The keys are in the kitchen. \nKIRSTY heads back to the kitchen.  JULIA helps LARRY towards the front door. \nThe CAMERA swings away from them, upstairs, and begins to track ... \nLAP-DISSOLVE TO: \nINT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY \n... we continue to track, towards the Torture Room. \nDownstairs, the front door slams. \nLAP-DISSOLVE TO: \nINT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY \nFrom outside, the sound of a car door slamming.  An engine starts.  The car drives away. \nWe move towards the blood on the floor.  As we watch, it begins to disappear, as if being absorbed by the room.  We pan up to the wall.  The plaster is not quite smooth; indeed, it now begins to grow restless, and cracks.  Something begins to move in the wall ... \n51   INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT \nAn explosion of laughter.  We \nCUT TO \nthe remains of a rack of lamb, its gravy now congealed, scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there. This is the centre-piece of a table reduced to a battlefield by the guests who are laughing off-screen. We pass along the table, taking in dirty plates and cutlery, napkins, glasses and emptied wine bottles. Finally, we reach JULIA, who is still sitting at the table, while the others have retired to more comfortable seats.  She looks utterly miserable, and a little drunk. \nThe room has been spruced up for the party.  Candles are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are pictures on the walls.  But this is essentially cosmetic.  The place has not been refurnished or re- decorated. \nWe move to the party guests.  Two, we recognize: KIRSTY, and LARRY - who is presently entertaining the gathering with an account of his accident.  The others are new faces.  An American couple:  BILL UNDERWOOD and his wife EVELYN, who are of an age with LARRY, and a younger, bespectacled man - a work colleague of LARRY's - STEVE O'DONNELL.  All are drunk. A brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and half a dozen other liquer bottles besides.  STEVE, it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on KIRSTY. \nLARRY is half-way through his hospital story, gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale, much to the pleasure of the rest.  His hand and lower arm are heavily bandaged. \nLARRY - always hated the sight of my own blood.  I go out like a light. Anybody else's?  no problem.  But mine ... you know ... goes straight to my head.  Anyhow, this damn doctor's poking around and I'm saying: I'm going to pass out, and he's saying, no you're not, no you're not.  Next thing I know - \nWe \nCUT BACK TO \nJULIA, who watches her husband, unamused. \nLARRY - I wake up On the floor. \nGales of laughter at this. \nAnd it was HIM who was looking sick. \nBILL Probably thought you'd sue. \nLARRY I should do it! \nEVELYN Doctors - \nLARRY I know.  And he's saying: I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. \nBILL HE'S sorry. \n", "test2_true": "EVELYN (protests) No ... no ... I ... \nLARRY Come on, you're only young once - \nLARRY fills up her glass. \nLARRY (to Kirsty) What are you drinking, love? \nKIRSTY (giggles) I've forgotten. \nLARRY Steve? \nSTEVE We're on the Cointreau. \nKIRSTY That's right.  Cointreau. \nSTEVE picks up the bottle. \nSTEVE I'll do it. \nHe fills up KIRSTY's glass. \nKIRSTY I won't be able to stand. \nSTEVE So lie down. \nShe casts him a sly glance.  He smiles.  She smiles. \nJULIA now stands up. \nJULIA Would you excuse me?  I think I'm going to go to bed. \nLARRY Are you O.K.? \nJULIA nods. \nBILL (looks at his watch) Christ.  I think it's time we were away - \nHe stands. \nLARRY Bill?  Absolutely not.  Sit down.  We've got celebrating to do. \nJULIA looks frosty, but LARRY does not catch the look. KIRSTY does however.  BILL sits down. \nSTEVE (to Julia) It was a wonderful meal. \nEVELYN (gushing) Oh it was.  It was wonderful. \nThere's a chorus of approval.  JULIA puts a smile on. \nJULIA I'm glad you enjoyed it. \nEVELYN See you again soon. \nBILL You must come round. \nEVELYN Yes.  You must.  We're so happy you're back. \nJULIA (at the door) That's nice.  Well ... goodnight. \nShe exits, to a chorus of goodnights.  KIRSTY in particular watches her as she makes her exit.  JULIA's behaviour confounds her.  Meanwhile, the conversation has returned to LARRY's 'wound'. \nEVELYN Does it still hurt? \nLARRY Only when I laugh. \nThis wins another round of laughter. \n52   INT.   LOWER LANDING   NIGHT \nJULIA walks along the landing, while the laughter - muted by distance - wafts up from below. \nFrom the floor above, she hears something more. She stops, puzzled, then starts up the second flight of stairs towards the Torture Room. \n53   INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT \nShe approaches the Torture Room, and steps inside. \n", "test2_id": 1504, "test3_input": "160  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT \nKIRSTY turns the corner of the street, and starts down it.  The wind is strong now.  It is full of sibilant whispers, hurrying her along. \n161  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT \nJULIA dresses. \n162  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT \nKIRSTY reaches the doorstep.  As she does so the whispers die away completely.   She beats on the door.   No reply. She beats again, more urgently. \nKIRSTY Please!   Dad!   It's me! It's Kirsty! \n163  INT.   LANDING   NIGHT \nJULIA steps onto the landing.  We can hear KIRSTY shouting on the step. \nJULIA Damn her. \nWe hear a voice, off-screen.  Is it FRANK or LARRY? Impossible to be sure. \nVOICE Answer it. \n164  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT \nKIRSTY still beats on the door. \nKIRSTY Please, answer me!  Please - \nThe door is suddenly opened.  JULIA is standing there. \nJULIA Kirsty?   It's very late. \nKIRSTY Where's Daddy? \nJULIA What's the problem? \nKIRSTY (stepping inside) I have to see my father. \nJULIA Of course.  There's no need to shout. \n165  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT \nWe pan across the table.  At the end of the table sits LARRY.  The light is behind him.  His features are shadowy.  But we can see that he is badly bruised. \nWe hear the womens' voices, off-screen. \nJULIA You look terrible.  Have you had an accident? \nKIRSTY I was here this afternoon. \nJULIA This afternoon. \nKIRSTY I saw everything. \nJULIA I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see? \nKIRSTY doesn't answer, but walks through into the Dining Room.  KIRSTY sees LARRY at the table. \nKIRSTY Oh God.  Thank God. (she starts to sob) I thought something might have ... \nShe glances round at JULIA, who has also entered. (to Larry) I have to talk to you. \nLARRY Of course. \nLARRY leans forward, and into the pool of light over the table.  He looks much the worse for wear.  His flesh is raw and bruised.  There is blood at his neck and hairline. \nLARRY It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right ... \nKIRSTY No.  You don't understand. Your brother - Frank - he's here in the house.  And he's - \nLARRY Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now. \nKIRSTY Finished? \nLARRY (smiles) He's gone. \nKIRSTY Gone? \n", "test3_true": "LARRY He was insane, baby:  a mad dog. I put him out of his misery - \nKIRSTY stares at LARRY, while in her head she hears the CENOBITE's voice. \nCENOBITE ... we'll tear your soul apart ... \nLARRY I'll go to the police, when I'm feeling stronger.  Try and find some way to make them understand, though God knows I don't really understand myself.  Did he hurt you? \nKIRSTY is dumb with horror at her situation. \nLARRY (leans back) Poor Frank.  He's better off dead. \nKIRSTY I don't believe it. \nLARRY I'm afraid it's true. \nKIRSTY (tears in her eyes) I want to see. \nLARRY No you don't. \nKIRSTY Yes! \nLARRY (to Julia) Show her. \nKIRSTY turns away from LARRY.  JULIA leads her out into the Hallway. \nCUT TO \nLARRY, still sitting at the table.  His fingers drum a familiar tattoo.   Beneath his breath, he hums 'Colonel Bogey'. \n166  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT \nJULIA pushes open the door of the Torture Room.  It creaks wide.  Lying on the floor inthe middle of the room is a skinned corpse, in a tangle of torn clothing. It steams.  There is blood everywhere.  That too, steams. \nKIRSTY is revolted.  She steps away from the door, back down the landing. \nThe bell has begun to ring again, distantly, and there is the sound of wings in the air - thousands of birds - beating on the other side of the wall. \nKIRSTY starts down the stairs again. \nJULIA Where are you going? \nKIRSTY doesn't reply.  She merely hurries away. \nJULIA (calling after her) You leave this to us, you hear me?   We'll deal with the police - \n167  INT.   HALLWAY   NIGHT \nKIRSTY descends the stairs.  LARRY has stepped out of the Dining Room and is moving to intercept her as she makes her way to the front door. \nThe sound of wings, and bells - and a terrible slow thunder which underpins it all - mounts in volume. \nLARRY snatches at her arm. \nLARRY Where are you going? \nKIRSTY I have to get out. \nShe shrugs off his arm.   The thunder is increasing. \nLARRY Stay with me - \nJULIA is on the stairs, watching this exchange. \nLARRY - it's all right.   Really it is ... \nHe touches her face, fondly. KIRSTY I can't stay. \nShe goes to the door. \nLARRY Come to Daddy. \nShe hesitates at the door, and turns. \n168  INT.  HALLWAY   NIGHT   (KIRSTY'S P.O.V.) \nThe thunder fills KIRSTY's head, as she stares at LARRY, who has opened his arms to her. \n", "test3_id": 1505}

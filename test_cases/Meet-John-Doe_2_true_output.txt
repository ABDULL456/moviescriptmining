JOE 
(reading) 
"Below is a letter which reached my desk this morning. It's a commentary on what we laughingly call the civilized world. 'Dear Miss Mitchell: Four years ago I was fired out of my job. Since then I haven't been able to get another one. At first I was sore at the state administration because it's on account of the slimy politics here we have all this unemployment. But in looking around, it seems the whole world's going to pot, so in protest I'm going to commit suicide by jumping off the City Hall roof!' Signed, A disgusted American citizen, John Doe.'" 
JOE pauses to absorb this. 
JOE 
(continues reading) 
"Editor's note . . . If you ask this column, the wrong people are jumping off roofs." 
JOE glances up toward ANN, in mild protest. 
JOE 
Hey, Ann, this is the old fakeroo, isn't it? 
Full shot: ANN has just about accumulated all her things. JOE stares at her, knowing it's a fake. 
ANN 
Never mind that, Joe. Go ahead. 
JOE shrugs, shakes his head, and exits. ANN stuffs her things under her arm and also goes. 
Int. Outer office: Med. shot: Voices ad lib"Awfully sorry you're not going." "Good-bye." (Laughing) 
ANN comes out. Suddenly, she stops, gets another idea, picks up a book from a desk, and reaches back to heave it. 
Med. shot: At CONNELL's office door. The sign-painter has just finished CONNELL's name, and as he leans back, pleased, wiping his brushes, the book flies in. The painter lifts his head slowly, his wrath too great to find utterance. 
Dissolve to: Int. GOVERNOR JACKSON's office: Close-up: Of two of GOVERNOR'S ASSOCIATES. 
MAN 
(reading newspaper) 
" . . . and it's because of the slimy politics that we have all this unemployment here." 
(agitated) 
There it is! That's D. B. Norton's opening attack on the Governor! 
2ND MAN 
Why Jim, it's just a letter sent in to a column. 
JIM 
No, no. I can smell it. That's Norton! 
While he speaks, the GOVERNOR has entered. 
GOVERNOR 
Good morning, gentlemen. You're rather early. 
MEN 
'Morning. 'Morning, Governor. 
GOVERNOR 
You're here rather early. 
JIM 
(pushes paper over to him) 
Did you happen to see this in the New Bulletin, Governor? 
He emphasizes the word "new" cynically. 
GOVERNOR 
Yes. I had it served with my breakfast this morning. 
2ND MAN 
Jim thinks it's D. B. Norton at work. 
JIM 
Of course it is! 
GOVERNOR 
Oh, come, Jim. That little item? D. B. Norton does things in a much bigger way . . . 
JIM 
This is his opening attack on you, Governor! Take my word for it! What did he buy a paper for? Why did he hire a high-pressure editor like Connell for? He's in the oil business! I tell you, Governor, he's after your scalp! 
GOVERNOR 
All right, Jim. Don't burst a blood vessel, I'll attend to it. 
(flips button on dictograph) 
Get me Spencer of the Daily Chronicle , please. 
Dissolve to: Int. SPENCER's office: Med. shot: SPENCER is on the telephone. 
SPENCER 
Yes. Yes. I saw it, Governor . . . and if you ask me that's a phoney letter. Why, that gag has got whiskers on it. Huh? Okay, I'll get the Mayor and maybe the Chamber of Commerce to go after them. 
(into dictagraph) 
Get Mayor Lovett on the phone! 
Int. MAYOR's office: Med. shot: Of MAYOR's secretary. 
SECRETARY 
(picking up phone) 
Hello? Sorry, the Mayor's busy on the other phone. 
Camera pans over to the MAYOR who is fatuous and excitable. 
MAYOR 
(into telephone) 
Yes, I know, Mrs. Brewster. It's a terrible reflection on our city. I've had a dozen calls already. 
SECRETARY enters scene. 
SECRETARY 
Spencer of the Chronicle . 
MAYOR 
Hold him. 
(into phone) 
Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening. 
The SECRETARY lays down the receiver. 
Dissolve to: Int. corner of a bedroom: Close shot: Of MRS. BREWSTERstout and loud. She is propped up in beda breakfast tray on her lapthe newspaper by her side. 
MRS. BREWSTER 
I insist that this John Doe man be found and given a job at once. If something isn't done. I'll call out the whole Auxiliary[3] yes, and the Junior Auxiliary, too. We'll hold a meeting and see 
Cut to: Int. MAYOR's office: Med. shot: Of MAYOR. He lays the receiver down and we continue to hear MRS. BREWSTER's voice. MAYOR picks up SPENCER's phone. 
MAYOR 
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too! 
SECRETARY 
Shh! 
MAYOR 
(to Secretary) 
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin ! 
(to Spencer) 
Why, he's liable to go right past my window, 
(suddenlyto Sec'yexcitably) 
What was that?!

He starts WASHING HER back. 
PAUL (CONT'D) What do you think of that? You know what I'm gonna be doing? JEANNE You will be on a... wheelchair! 
PAUL Well, maybe. But, you know... I'll be smirking and giggling all the way to eternity. 
JEANNE How poetic. But please, before you go, wash my feet. 
She holds up A FOOT. 
PAUL OK. oblesse oblige. 
He sits on the edge of the TUB and grabs her foot. He takes a sniff... She pulls it away. 
JEANNE You know, he and I, we make love. 
He WASHES her foot. 
PAUL Oh, really? That's wonderful. Is he a good fucker? 
JEANNE Magnificent. 
He puts up the OTHER FOOT to was, he obliges again. 
PAUL You know, you're a jerk. Cos the best fucking you're gonna get is right here in this apartment. Stand up. 
She does. He washes her ASS. 
JEANNE He is full of mysteries. 
PAUL Give me the soap. Listen, you dumb dodo. All the mysteries that you're ever gonna know in life are right here. 
He washes her STOMACH. JEANNE He is like everybody but... at the same time he's different. 
PAUL You mean, like everybody. 
JEANNE Yeah, but... even he fright me. Even he frightens me. 
PAUL What is he, your local pimp? 
JEANNE He could be. He looks it. You know why I'm in love with him? 
PAUL I can't wait. 
JEANNE Because he know. He know how to make me fall in love with him. 
She gets out. He COVERS her with a BIG RED TOWEL. 
PAUL You want this man you love to protect and take care of you. 
JEANNE Yeah. 
PAUL You want this golden, shining, powerful warrior to build a fortress where you can hide in. So you don't have to ever... have... You don't ever have to be afraid. You don't have to feel lonely or empty. That's what you want, isn't it? 
JEANNE Yes. 
PAUL Well, you'll never find it. 
JEANNE But I find this man. PAUL Then it won't be long until he'll want you to build a fortress for him out of your tits and out of your cunt and your hair and your smile and the way you smell. And... and some place where he can feel comfortable and secure enough so that he can worship in front of the altar of his own prick. 
JEANNE But I find this man! 
They lean against SEPERATE WALLS. 
PAUL No, you're alone. You're all alone. You won't be free of that feeling of being alone until you look death right in the face. I mean, that sounds like bullshit, some romantic crap, until you go right up into the ass of death. Right up in his ass... till you find the womb of fear. And then,... maybe... Maybe then, you'll be able to find him. 
JEANNE But I find this man. He's you! You are that man! 
Paul doesn't like that comment. He needs to TEACH HER another LESSON. He bites a HANGNAIL. 
PAUL Get me the scissors. 
JEANNE What? 
PAUL Get me the fingernail scissors. 
She STOMPS past him to get them, hands them to him. 
PAUL (CONT'D) No. I want you to cut the fingernails on your right hand, these two. She DOES.

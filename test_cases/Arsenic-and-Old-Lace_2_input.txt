Teddy stops a few steps from floor level. 
TEDDY Oh, that's my daughter, Alice. 
ELAINE Oh, no, Teddy ! Teddy ! 
TEDDY Now, Alice, don't be a tomboy. Don't play rough with the gentlemen. He pulls out his imaginary sword and rushes up the stairs. 
TEDDY Charge ! 
He rushes into his room and slams the door. 
ELAINE Teddy ! 
Elaine starts screaming. Jonathan holds a handkerchief over her mouth. Einstein runs to the front door and switches the lights off. 
JONATHAN Doctor, the cellar. 
ELAINE Let go of me ! Let go of me ! 
The cellar door is opened, and we see the shadows of the two men dragging Elaine down to the cellar. MARTHA What's the matter ? What's happening down there ? 
The lights are switched back on, and we see Abby and Martha on the balcony, just coming out of their room. They are both dressed in black funeral clothes. 
ABBY What's the matter ? What are you doing there ? 
Jonathan is coming alone out of the cellar. 
JONATHAN We caught a burglar, a sneak thief. Go back to your room. 
ABBY We'll call the police. 
She starts going down the stairs, followed by Martha. 
JONATHAN I'll handle this. Go back to your room. 
Abby stops at the top of the stairs. 
JONATHAN Do you hear me ? 
Knocking on the door, followed by the doorbell. The two sisters starts going down the stairs. 
JONATHAN Don't answer that. 
Another doorbell. The two sisters are running downstairs. 
JONATHAN Don't answer that ! 
Elaine rushes through the cellar door, screaming. She runs into Martha's arms, followed by Einstein. 
ELAINE Let go of me ! 
More knocking and ringing at the door. Abby goes and opens the door. Mortimer enters the house.. 
MORTIMER Where's Teddy ? Is he upstairs ? 
Elaine rushes to Mortimer and holds him by the neck. He gets rid of her. 
MORTIMER Never mind that now, darling, please. 
He starts climbing the stairs and looks, surprised, at Martha. MORTIMER What are you doing with your best clothes on ? 
He suddenly notices Jonathan's presence and stops mounting the stairs. 
MORTIMER Holy... What's that ? What's that thing there that looks like a cigar-store dummy ? 
ABBY It's your brother Jonathan, and this is Doctor Einstein. 
MORTIMER Aunt Abby, didn't I tell you not to let anybody in the house ? Who did you say it was ? 
ABBY It's your brother, Jonathan ! 
Elaine grabs Mortimer's coat, and starts talking to him. So do Abby and Martha on either side of him. Since the three of them are talking together, it is impossible to understand what they say. 
JONATHAN I've come back home, Mortimer. 
At the voice of Jonathan, the three women stop talking 
MORTIMER What ? 
JONATHAN I've come back home, Mortimer. 
MORTIMER «I've come back home, Mortimer.» Listen, it talks ! JONATHAN Yes, I talk. Mortimer, have you forgotten the things I used to do to you when you were tied to the bedpost ? The needles under your fingernails. 
Elaine grabs Mortimer's coat. 
ELAINE Mortimer, he... 
MORTIMER Wait a minute. 
Mortimer walks closer to Jonathan. 
MORTIMER Holy mackerel ! It is Jonathan ! 
JONATHAN I'm glad you remember, Mortimer. 
MORTIMER Yeah, I remember. How could I forget you ? Where'd you get that face ? Hollywood ? 
Jonathan is ready to fight with his brother. Einstein grabs his arm to stop him and Abby comes between them. 
ABBY Oh, don't you two boys start quarreling again the minute you've seen each other. 
MARTHA We invited Jonathan and Doctor Einstein to stay. 
MORTIMER What ? 
MARTHA Just for tonight. 
MORTIMER Oh no, you don't, I'm staying here tonight. In fact, I'm staying here from now on. 
Elaine taps on Mortimer's arm. 
ELAINE Mortimer, what about me ? 
MORTIMER There's no room for anybody else in the house. (to Elaine) Please, darling, just a moment. (to Jonathan) So take that little squirt and beat it ! (to Martha) Now where's Teddy ? I've got to see him right away. Is he upstairs ? He starts climbing the stairs. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Mister Brewster ! We don't take up much room. Johnny can sleep on the sofa, and I'll sleep on the window-seat. 
MORTIMER Nothing to... 
He stops going upstairs

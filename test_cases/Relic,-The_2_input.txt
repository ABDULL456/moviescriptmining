The group has reached another intersection of tunnels.  The left fork turns back uphill.  D'Agosta indicates this tunnel. 
D'AGOSTA At least we'll be dry. 
They all press forward in the low vaulted darkness.  As they move steadily upwards the water recedes.  Kawakita's flashlight flickers and he bangs it.  It comes on again. 
KAWAKITA I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection. 
D'AGOSTA Not so loud. 
D'Agosta shines his light forward and they see that the shaft ends in a large round PIPE. 
KAWAKITA What's that? 
D'AGOSTA All right everybody, hold up! 
Kawakita and D'Agosta move past the shivering people who are strung out along the sides of the tunnel.  D'Agosta touches each person as he passes. 
D'AGOSTA We don't know what's in there.  Let me go first. 
INT. PIPE - NIGHT 
The Mayor follows behind with the group as Kawakita and D'Agosta lead the way.  The pipe is dry and rusted.  They move forward with stealth. In twenty feet the pipe ends abruptly in darkness.  D'Agosta steps out first. 
INT. CAVERN - NIGHT 
The group huddles at the mouth of the pipe, confused, as D'Agosta pans his flashlight around the huge space.  The walls are carved out of dirt and rounded like a cave.  From the ceiling hang huge cobwebs.  There's a large pile of sticks in one corner fashioned rather like a bed.  On a mound of dirt beside this bed rests a battered duffel bag. 
Greg moves to it, shines his light on the side.  A name is written in marker. 
D'AGOSTA What does it say? 
KAWAKITA (looks up, shocked) Dr. John Whittlesley. 
D'AGOSTA What's that doing here? 
KAWAKITA I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America. 
MAYOR (interrupts) Look.  There's a ladder at the end.  I think it goes up to the street! 
They move forward into the darkness eagerly, towards the ladder which leads up to a manhole.  But as they pass the bed of twigs, something loud CRUNCHES underfoot. 
KAWAKITA What is that? 
D'Agosta shines his light down and everyone freezes.  Then one woman SCREAMS! 
The wide dirt floor around them is carpeted in clean white BONES!  The HUMMING noise is louder and we see its source.  Atop the bones is the body of CUTHBERT!  It's covered with BLACK DERMESTID BEETLES.  They're stripping the skeleton clean, devouring the flesh! 
The group panics and breaks for the ladder.  Kawakita and D'Agosta once more guard the rear. 
KAWAKITA Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant? 
D'AGOSTA I'd say we're in its home. 
INT. HALL OF THE NORTHWEST COAST INDIANS - NIGHT 
Pendergast and Margo run down the long dark room, passing an enormous hollowed-out canoe.  As they exit the far end, the dark shape of Mbwun emerges.  It leaps forward, closing in fast. 
INT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT 
Margo and Pendergast enter a series of maze-like room with hidden corners, nooks and crannies with cases full of esoteric Buddhist and Japanese Art.  They're running through the twists and turns as fast as they can. 
PENDERGAST We're not going to make the storage room! 
MARGO Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye! 
AT THIS THEY ROUND A CORNER AND MBWUN LEAPS OUT!  It circled ahead and was waiting in front of them!  The animal swipes at Margo and Pendergast.  The force of the monster's blow sends Margo reeling and slams Pendergast into the wall.  He falls, crumples and drops his gun! The case beside him SHATTERS spewing relics, as Mbwun pushes past. Pendergast groans and gets to his knees with difficulty. 
MARGO is frantically crawling away in the dark!  The beast makes a low sound of pleasure and reaches out one claw, easily pins her down. Pendergast looks frantically for any kind of weapon! 
ON MARGO now PINNED BENEATH the heaving body of the monster! Powerless, she looks up into the horrible face of death as Mbwun raises an enormous claw!  Pendergast, desperate, cries out -- 
PENDERGAST Please, no!  Don't hurt Margo! 
Oddly enough, the beast pauses for once.  Talking to the damn thing is the one tactic no one has tried!  The claw halts in mid-air.  The beast blinks once and looks from Pendergast to Margo.  Margo sees a flash of something unexpectedly HUMANin its eyes!  In astonishment, she whispers... 
MARGO My God.  You understand.

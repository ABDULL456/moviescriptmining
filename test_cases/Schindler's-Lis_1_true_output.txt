STERN The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing. 
SCHINDLER But it's less. It's less than what I would pay a Pole. That's the point I'm trying to make. Poles cost more. 
Stern hesitates, then nods. The look on Schindler's face says, Well, what's to debate, the answer's clear to any fool. 
SCHINDLER Why should I hire Poles? 
INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY 
Another machine starting up, growling louder, louder -- 
EXT. PEACE SQUARE, THE GHETTO - DAY 
To a yellow identity card with a sepia photograph a German clerk attaches a blue sticker, the holy Blauschein, proof that the carrier is an essential worker. At other folding tables other clerks pass summary judgment on hundreds of ghetto dwellers standing in long lines. 
TEACHER I'm a teacher. 
The man tries to hand over documentation supporting the claim along with his Kennkarte to a German clerk. 
CLERK Not essential work, stand over there. 
Over there, other "non-essential people" are climbing onto trucks bound for unknown destinations. The teacher reluctantly relinquishes his place in line. 
EXT. PEACE SQUARE - LATER - DAY 
The teacher at the head of the line again, but this time with Stern at his side. 
TEACHER I'm a metal polisher. 
He hands over a piece of paper. The clerk takes a look, is satisfied with it, brushes glue on the back of a Blauschein and sticks it to the man's work card. 
CLERK Good. 
The world's gone mad. 
INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY 
Another machine starting up, a lathe. A technician points things out to the teacher and some others recruited by Stern. 
The motor grinds louder, louder. 
INT. APARTMENT - DAY 
Schindler wanders around a large empty apartment. There's lots of light, glass bricks, modern lines, windows looking out on a park. 
INT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The same place full of furniture and people. Lots of SS in uniform. Wine. Girls. Schindler, drinking with Oberfuhrer Scherner, keeps glancing across the room to a particularly good-looking Polish girl with another guy in uniform. 
SCHERNER I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it -- money, favors -- I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -- 
SCHINDLER No, look. It's the others. They're the ones causing these delays. 
SCHERNER What others? 
SCHINDLER Whoever. They're the ones. They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me. 
Scherner thinks he understands what Schindler's saying. Just in case he doesn't -- 
SCHINDLER I should send it to you, though, don't you think? You can forward it on? I'd be grateful. 
Scherner nods. Yes, they understand each other. 
SCHERNER That'd be fine. 
SCHINDLER Done. Let's not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time. 
INT. SS OFFICE - DAY 
Scherner at his desk initialing several Armaments contracts. 
The letters D.E.F. appear on all of them. 
EXT. FACTORY - DAY 
Men and pulleys hoist a big "F" up the side of the building. 
Down below, Schindler watches as the letter is set into place -- D.E.F. 
INT. FACTORY OFFICES - DAY 
The good-looking Polish girl from the party, Klonowska, is shown to her desk by Stern. It's right outside Schindler's office. This girl has never typed in her life. 
INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY 
Flames ignite with a whoosh in one of the huge furnaces. The needle on a gauge slowly climbs. 
EXT. CRACOW - DAY 
A garage door slides open revealing a gleaming black Mercedes. Schindler steps past Pfefferberg and, moving around the car, carefully touches its smooth lines.

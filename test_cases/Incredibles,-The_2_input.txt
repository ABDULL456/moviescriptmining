__________________________________________SCENE 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
Is this on? 
INTERVIEWER 
That's fine. 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
I can break through walls, I just can't... 
INTERVIEWER 
That's fine. 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
I can't get this on. 
INTERVIEWER 
So, Mr. Incredible...do you have a secret identity? 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
Every superhero has a secret identity. I don't know a single one who doesn't. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time? 
ELASTIGIRL 
Of course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, y'know what I mean? 
FROZONE 
Superladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret identity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something like that. I said, ''Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego.'' or anything like that. I mean, you tell me you're a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good. 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved, you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. ''I just cleaned up this mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?'' 
INTERVIEWER 
I could get to that point. 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
''Please?'' 
INTERVIEWER 
Wait, no, don't get up. We're not finished. 
MR. INCREDIBLE 
Sometimes l think I'd just like the simple life, you know? Relax a little and raise a family. 
ELASTIGIRL 
Settle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game! I'm right up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don't think so. I don't think so.

POLICE RADIO 
We interrupt for an important bulletin. A deadly high-speed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway, traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave. 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Yeah, I've got time. 
OLD LADY 
Mr. lncredible. Um, Mr. Incredible... 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
What is it, ma'am? 
OLD LADY 
My cat, Squeaker, won't come down. 
[cat meows] 
BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE) 
Certainly, ma'am but I suggest you stand clear. There could be trouble.

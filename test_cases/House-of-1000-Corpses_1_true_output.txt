MOTHER Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform. 
She closes the door. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME 
Naish and Willis bust open the door to the smokehouse. Hanging upside down inside is Mary. She hangs from ropes strapped to the ceiling. Large hunks of meat hang around her in the cramped room. 
NAISH Jesus Christ. 
MR. WILLIS Call Wydell. 
INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME 
Wydell and Mother sit opposite eachother at the kitchen table. Pictures of Denise and her companions are spread on the table. Wydell takes notes as Mother talks. 
WYDELL Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way? 
MOTHER No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before... (points to the photo of Bill) ...he looks familiar, is he on TV? 
Suddenly, Naish's voice comes over Wydell's walkie-talkie. 
NAISH Wydell. 
WYDELL Excuse me for a second. 
Pulls walkie-talkie from his belt to respond. 
WYDELL Over. 
NAISH We found one. 
Click. Mother points the gun at Wydell's head and fires. 
He falls dead to the floor. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME 
Naish hears the commotion over his walkie-talkie. 
NAISH (into walkie-talkie) Wydell! Over! Wydell! Over! 
No response. 
NAISH Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down. 
MR. WILLIS Right. 
Willis runs to the car, he gets about halfway there before he is hit in the back by a bullet. He stumbles and falls to his knees. 
He kneels silent, stunned. We hold on his face and watch as his life passes before him. 
A quick MONTAGE, we see the following images flash by: 
A. A father and daughter together in happier times. 
B. A child's birthday party. 
C. A baby crying. 
D. Willis and his deceased wife. 
Otis fires another shot. 
Willis falls forward into the mud, dead. 
Naish sees Willis fall. Before he can react a voice calls out from behind him. 
OTIS Hands up, bitch! 
Naish raises his hands. 
OTIS Turn around, real slow... piggy-pie. 
Naish turns around.

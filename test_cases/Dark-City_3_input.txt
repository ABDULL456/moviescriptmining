BUMSTEAD I didn't tell you the entire reason I helped you.  It started with two little girls.  Twins.  Used to play with them when I was young.  Couldn't remember for the life of me what they looked like, then I understood why... 
He looks at the dashboard, brushes away a small piece of lint. 
BUMSTEAD They didn't have faces. 
WHITE What? 
BUMSTEAD That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory. (looks back at White) That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject. 
He glances at White, then back to the road. 
BUMSTEAD Everything was liquid beneath a thin surface that had always seemed solid to me... 
Bumstead and White are quiet momentarily, then: 
BUMSTEAD Is there anything you haven't told me about this business?  Even the most insignificant thing? 
WHITE (thinking) No.  Nothing I can think of. Except... 
BUMSTEAD Go on. 
WHITE Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there. 
BUMSTEAD Why, that's ridiculous.  You just... 
He trails off.  Shakes his head slowly. 
BUMSTEAD We'll get to the bottom of this.  I mean it. 
INT.  SCHREBER'S SURGERY 
The doctor is sitting at his desk, when the door bursts open suddenly.  White and Bumstead move into the room and grab the doctor before he can protest. 
BUMSTEAD I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin... 
SCHREBER I don't know what you're talking about. 
BUMSTEAD That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time... 
SCHREBER You are mistaken. 
WHITE What are you hiding? 
SCHREBER Nothing.  I don't know anything! 
BUMSTEAD removes his revolver, sticks it in the doctor's face. 
SCHREBER Please, they'll kill me... 
BUMSTEAD I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends. 
EXT.  ALLEY  -  NIGHT 
SCHREBER, BUMSTEAD AND WHITE sit in Bumstead's car in an alleyway. 
Schreber points to a SOLITARY METAL DOOR in a wall. 
SCHREBER In there. 
BUMSTEAD Just like that? 
The threesome step from the car, keep close to a wall. 
Schreber alone steps up to the door, leans down to a mat at the foot of the door, lifts it and takes a KEY from underneath.  He unlocks the door, opens it, puts the key back, goes inside.  He waves the other men forward. 
White and Bumstead step up to the door  -  Bumstead looks at the mat  -  it says:  WELCOME on it. 
A CORRIDOR 
Through the door  -  AN ELEVATOR.  There is only a down button. Schreber presses it, several seconds later the doors open. 
They step inside.  The doors close, the lift descends. 
BUMSTEAD What is this place? 
SCHREBER You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself. 
When the doors open again the three men look out on a DARK PASSAGEWAY. 
EXT.  LIBRARY  -  NIGHT 
The PUPPET wheels up to the sweeping set of stairs at the base of the building.  It stops, WHEELS BUMP into the steps repeatedly.  It looks down and shrieks with a string of mechanical obscenities. 
INT.  MYSTERY MEN'S UNDERWORLD 
WHITE and BUMSTEAD follow SCHREBER down a corridor to what appears to be an ancient crypt.  They enter a door  -  it has something written on it in a strange language. 
INSIDE IS A ROOM 
They stumble around in the darkness, Schreber finds a light switch, suddenly White STOPS dead in his tracks  -  Bumstead turns to him. 
WHITE Look. 
White points to a wall featuring a line of brass hooks.  On these hooks hang MYSTERY MEN coats -  that's not all.  Each hook carries A FACE.

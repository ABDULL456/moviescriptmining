CHARLIE (V.O.) One M-80 in the toilet bowl too many. 
Some kids in the bathroom saw the whole thing. 
KID That was rad! 
HALF-EAR Wha'? 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. MINI - DAY 
And now a RUMBLING in the distance. Stella looks. Sees a car streaking their way, almost like a mirage in the heat waves coming off the pavement. Closer. Faster. A classic Mustang. Its engine rumbles like a jackhammer. It's had some serious custom work done to it. 
CHARLIE Handsome Rob. Premier wheel man. He once drove all the way to L.A. just so he could set the record for longest freeway chase. 
QUICK CUT TO: 
EXT. L.A. FREEWAY - 1999 - DAY 
Handsome Rob's behind the wheel, flicks a cigarette butt out his open window -- 
We watch it hit the pavement, ashes spark, and then behind the fallen butt we see that every lane of the 405 is filled with cop cars in pursuit. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) Smashed the mark by twelve minutes. 
We now see Handsome Rob through the lens of a TV news helicopter camera. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) He got a hundred and ten love letters sent to his jail cell from women who saw him on TV. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. MINI - DAY 
As the cars converge in the parking lot... 
STELLA And what about you? 
CHARLIE I've been a thief since I had baby teeth. 
QUICK CUT TO: 
INT. GRAMMAR SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY 
SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE is shoved against a chain link fence by a SIXTH GRADE BULLY. 
BULLY Cough it up, Charlie! 
Charlie hands the bully a dollar bill. The bully puts it in a wallet that is over-stuffed with cash and saunters off, laughing it up with his bully pals. Charlie turns to his 2nd grade classmate who sports a fresh black eye. 
CLASSMATE So much for lunch. 
SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE You need a dollar? 
CLASSMATE I thought he took your last one. 
SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE He did. 
Charlie holds up the over-stuffed wallet that he pickpocketed from the bully. 
SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE But I got lots more now. 
CUT BACK TO: 
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
Doors open simultaneously. Everyone out. The crew eyes Stella. Charlie gets right down to business. 
CHARLIE This is Stella. She's working with us on this one. IDs? 
Handsome Rob hands out fake driver's licenses. 
LYLE (reading his) Melvin Lisp? Could I -- just once -- have a cool name? 
HALF-EAR (also complaining) 220 pounds? Try 180. 
HANDSOME ROB Try 'Deal A Meal'. 
LYLE I don't even have a cool nickname. 
CHARLIE Enough of this sewing-circle shit. Phones. 
Half-Ear hands out new cell phone to everyone and takes their old phones.

FBI AGENT #10 Stay out of the way! 
PISCANO'S WIFE Artie! Artie! 
FBI AGENT #10 We can't help him if - 
EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - DAY 
ACE opens his front door and is confronted by two FBI AGENTS. He is shown pictures of NICKY and GINGER at the construction site. 
ACE (V.O.) (Quietly) And at the end of the day, they finally came to see me with the pictures. 
FBI AGENT #1 (Pointing to the pictures) Why protect a friend who betrayed you like that? 
ACE (V.O.) But I didn't want to look at 'em. I didn't want to look at the guys who brought 'em either. 
ACE refuses to look at the photos and quietly closes the door on the AGENTS. 
INT. FEDERAL COURT-HOUSE - DAY 
GAGGI, FORLANO, BORELLI and CAPELLI are all in court. FORLANO and CAPELLI are breathing through masks and oxygen tanks with nearby doctors and nurses. GAGGI 
has a cane in front of him. Several court spectators look on. We hear the bosses' lawyer speak. 
LAWYER Your Honor, as you can see, my clients are elderly and infirm. Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk. They are no danger to the community and they pose no flight risk. 
NICKY (V.O.) When the bosses were arrested, some of 'em were so old they needed doctors at their arraignment. 
LAWYER And Pre-trial Services recommends that bail remain as presently set. 
JUDGE (Calling a recess) We're going to take a ten-minute recess. 
The JUDGE pounds his gavel. 
NICKY (V.O.) And when it looked like they could get twenty-five years... 
The BOSSES, their nurses and lawyer file through a side court door. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...to life in prison, just for skimmin' a casino... sick or no fuckin' sick, you knew people were gonna get clipped. So, the day of the arraignment, they had this meeting right in the back of the court-house. 
INT. COURT-HOUSE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
The BOSSES are gathered around a conference table as the lawyers and nurses silently walk out the door as if on cue. 
NICKY (V.O.) See, when something like this happens, you know how things are gonna work out. It's always better with no witnesses. So, what about Andy? 
THE CAMERA PANS FROM ONE BOSS TO THE OTHER. 
FORLANO (Putting down his oxygen mask once the door behind him is shut) He won't talk. Stone is a good kid. Stand-up guy, just like his old man. That's the way I see it. 
BORELLI I agree. He's solid. A fuckin' Marine. 
CAPELLI (Holding his oxygen mask) He's okay. He always was. Remo, what do you think? 
GAGGI (Pause) Look... why take a chance? At least, that's the way I feel about it. 
EXT. BACK HOME RESTAURANT, STRIP MALL PARKING LOT - DAY 
ANDY STONE and his LAWYER are walking toward their car. 
STONE You call Artie... and you tell him I don't care what, he's gotta be in my office Thursday morning before eleven o'clock. 
LAWYER It's done. 
His LAWYER veers to the left, walking away from STONE who keeps talking. 
LAWYER (O.S.) It's done. 
STONE (To himself) It's terribly important. I gotta have a conversation with this guy. That's all. 
GAGGI's men, CURLY and BEEPER, appear from behind STONE and shoot him dead. 
They empty their silent half-load rounds into STONE even after he's down on the snowy ground. They walk away discreetly, leaving him partially hidden between cars. 
NICKY (V.O.) As much as they liked him, I mean, he wasn't one of us. He wasn't Italian. As far as they knew, he could have talked. Otherwise, Stony might still be alive. 
MONTAGE OF MURDERS: 
EXT. NANCE'S COSTA RICAN HOUSE - DAY 
TITLE IN: COSTA RICA 
The camera moves down a waterfall to reveal NANCE's Spanish- style house. 
NICKY (V.O.) The first one to skip was John Nance. He found a nice, warm secluded place in Costa Rica. He thought nobody would find him there. 
Several gunshots are heard. NANCE emerges from the house through a door and runs along a verandah to another door. He breaks a pane of glass, unlocks another door and runs in. BEEPER emerges from the first door and follows him back into the house. Several more shots are heard. NANCE emerges from yet another door, only this time he's been shot in the stomach. He painfully staggers away from the hitmen. 
NICKY (V.O.) But, then, his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs, and so naturally the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hidin' just to save his kid and give 'em all up.  So... 
CURLY and BEEPER come out of the house and approach NANCE from behind. 
CURLY Hey, where you goin', jag-off? 
NANCE kneels down. CURLY points his gun expertly at the top of NANCE's head and fires. Blood splatters from NANCE's mouth and he falls to the ground. The gunmen walk away. 
NICKY (V.O.) But anyway, they, you know, they all had to follow. 
EXT. HOLE IN THE DESERT - DUSK 
A bound COUNT ROOM EXEC and a CLERK are kneeling next to a large pit in the esert ground in front of BEEPER and CURLY. 
NICKY (V.O.) Everybody went down. 
The CLERK groans as he's shot in the head by BEEPER. Blood splatters and he falls right into the pre-dug hole. 
COUNT ROOM EXEC Go ahead, fuck... 
CURLY Fuck you. 
CURLY shoots the EXEC in the head, he too falls backward into the pit. The gunmen fire more rounds into the bodies, then toss their guns into the hole. 
NICKY (V.O.) Before you knew it... 
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
RICHIE, a sharply dressed Tangiers EXEC, is getting into his new Lincoln. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...anybody who knew anything wound up gettin' whacked. 
CURLY sneaks up from behind and hits the EXEC with a lead pipe. He puts a plastic bag over his head and begins to choke him to death. The EXEC struggles a bit but the bag soon fills with blood. CURLY strikes him with the pipe one last time. 
INT. BEVERLY SUNSET MOTEL - NIGHT 
The camera pans away from an empty registration desk to a motel corridor. 
GINGER (O.S.) (Gasping) Oh! Oh, no!  No... 
The camera moves past several rooms along a cinder block wall. 
ACE (V.O.) After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody. She found some pimps, low-lifes, druggies and bikers in LA. And in a few months, they went through all the money and all the jewels. 
Suddenly, a door opens and GINGER overdosing, staggers into the hall looking for help. She gasps, goes halfway down the seedy corridor towards the desk, but collapses and dies. 
FREEZE FRAME ON GINGER SPRAWLED OUT ON THE MOTEL CARPET. 
ACE (V.O.) After they found her body... I had a private doctor do another autopsy. He said they gave her... a hot dose. In the end... all she had left was thirty-six hundred in mint-condition coins. 
END OF MONTAGE 
EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY 
ACE emerges from the restaurant, smoking a cigarette as in the first scene in the film. He gets into his car to start the ignition. 
ACE (V.O.) No matter what the Feds or the papers might have said about my car bombing... 
Flames surge from the windshield, concealing ACE behind the wheel. 
FLASHBACK: EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY 
The sign above him reads: 'Tony Roma's a Place for Ribs'. ACE is leaving the restaurant and walking to his car. 
ACE (V.O.) ...it was amateur night, and you could tell. Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side. But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew, was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat. It's the only thing that saved my life. 
ACE opens his car door and gets in. 
INT. ACE'S CAR, TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY 
ACE turns on the ignition and we see two- and three-inch flames come out of the defroster vents. Everything goes silent as he is suddenly engulfed in flames. 
The car explodes in flames two storeys high. The screen fills with the rising explosion of smoke and fire. 
ACE (V.O.) The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse. 
EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD - DAY 
NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of a car on a farm road for a meeting. FAT SALLY, a heavy-set wiseguy, is already there. 
FAT SALLY (O.S.) Hey, Nicky. 
ACE (V.O.) And so did the power that be. 
NICKY Hey, Mikey, how's your hernia? 
They shake hands. 
FAT SALLY How you doin'? 
MARINO approaches NICKY from behind. 
NICKY (V.O.) It took months for... 
FLASHBACK: EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD - DAY 
NICKY's car drives up the farm road to meet his crew. 
NICKY: (V.O.) ...everything to calm down, but finally my guys got out on bail and the bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas.  Always the dollars, always the fuckin'... 
NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of the car to greet FAT SALLY. HARDY, FUSCO and BEEPER are also waiting there, smiling. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...dollars. I mean, it was still way too hot for me to even go near Vegas, so I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks. I didn't want my brother to get fucked around. 
NICKY shakes hands with SALLY. FUSCO walks up to say hello. 
NICKY (V.O.) I mean, what's right is right. They don't give a fuck about - urgghh!

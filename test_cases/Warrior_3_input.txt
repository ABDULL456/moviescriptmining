INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - LATER 
The crowd at the gym both CHEERS and JEERS at the TV. 
ON TV SCREEN: MAD DOG GRIMES, SUPREMELY CONFIDENT, CLIMBS INTO THE CAGE AND GETS IN TOMMY'S FACE. HE HAS DYED HIS MOHAWK CAMOUFLAGE COLORS TO MOCK TOMMY. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Mad Dog Grimes has been looking for revenge ever since the day Tommy Riordan walked into his gym in Pittsburgh and turned his life upside down. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) It's been a very long, very miserable few months for Mad Dog to say the least. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME 
Mad Dog and Tommy in a STARE DOWN as Josh Rosenthal attempts to give them instructions. Unless Mad Dog's mother is in the building, every single person in the Boardwalk Hall is rooting for Tommy. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Mad Dog mocking Tommy with a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight and the Marines are really letting Mad Dog have it. 
The Marines hoot and holler at Mad Dog as Josh Rosenthal goes over his instructions with the two fighters. 
JOSH ROSENTHAL Alright gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this. 
In the center of the cage, Mad Dog is practically spitting in Tommy's face. Tommy's eyelids droop. He could not be less intimidated. 
MAD DOG It's not gonna happen again. 
Callen and Sheridan look on as the two fighters retreat to their corners. The anticipation in the arena is incredible. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Mad Dog predicted an early knockout. Said he was gonna knock Tommy out with one punch. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Let's see what Tommy has to say about that. 
Josh Rosenthal looks at Tommy and Mad Dog. 
JOSH ROSENTHAL Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war! 
CALLEN (V.O.) And they are off! 
Tommy goes after Mad Dog like it's the last night on earth. What Tommy did to him at Colt's Gym was an exercise in restraint compared to what's happening in that cage. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Tommy tackles him and he's on top! He's raining blows! 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Someone has to stop this. 
Mad Dog is on his back and being pounded on. Tommy's rage is shocking, even by his own brutal standards. From cageside, Colt Boyd SCREAMS at Josh Rosenthal. 
COLT BOYD Stop it! Stop the fight! 
It's such a savage beating, so malicious, that Rosenthal has to climb on Tommy's back to get him off of Mad Dog. If his mother is indeed in the crowd, she couldn't recognize him now. Beaten to an absolute pulp. 
CALLEN (V.O.) That's the fastest knockout I think I've ever seen. 
SHERIDAN (V.O.) Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed. He is not moving. 
Tommy marches out of the cage and past Colt Boyd, Punkass, and SkySkrape, who can't believe what they just witnessed. Neither can anyone else at Boardwalk Hall. In the cage, a MEDIC tends to Mad Dog. 
CALLEN (V.O.) I'll tell you what: you do that to someone on the street and they'd lock you up and throw away the key! Break out the yellow tape, Sam. Tommy's walking away from the cage like he's leaving a crime scene. 
EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN, PHILADELPHIA - LATER 
"ODE TO JOY" is heard coming from distant speakers as ROWS OF CARS line up at the entrance and pull into the lot. 
Pull back to reveal an enormous, old drive-in movie theater packed with a RAUCOUS CROWD. On the gigantic MOVIE SCREEN, Brendan makes his way through the arena and into the cage. As he does, CHEERS erupt in the parking lot. Stephon, Nash, KC, Tito, and some of the other students from Brendan's class root him on. They came up with a pretty good Plan B. 
As the kids get fired up for the fight, they're joined by a familiar face that emerges from the crowd. Joe Zito. Tito shakes his hand. Smacks Stephon. Look who's here. 
INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME 
Brendan climbs into the cage to a major OVATION from the crowd. They're completely on his side now.

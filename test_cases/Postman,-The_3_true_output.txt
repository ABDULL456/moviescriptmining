ABBY Have you ever had herpes or syphilis or anything like that? 
He shakes his head "no."    They continue to dance. 
ABBY So as far as you know, you have good semen? 
THE POSTMAN Is that a trick question? 
ABBY I don't mean to be nosy. I'm only asking because I want you to make me pregnant. 
Stunned, The Postman stops dancing.      Abby takes this moment to grab Michael. 
THE POSTMAN (to himself) It's got to be the uniform. 
Abby takes Michael's arm, introduces him proudly. 
ABBY This is my husband.    Michael. 
Michael smiles, shakes hands with a grave-digger's grip. The Postman doesn't know what to think. 
ABBY We've been trying to have a baby for three years. We can't on account of Michael had the bad mumps when he was twelve. So we need a body father. We could ask a man here, but it could cause trouble. I've seen it happen. Things go okay until the woman starts to show. Then it can be bad. But you'll only be around once in awhile with the mail. 
The Postman just stares at them.      Abby looks to Michael. 
ABBY He hasn't said 'no'.

MICHAEL (undaunted) What do you say, mister?     You'd be doing us a favor. 
THE POSTMAN I'll have to think about it. 
The Postman excuses himself with a nod and turns away, shaking his head at the strangeness of this new world. 
But no rest for the wicked, as soon as he's free from Abby and Michael, he's running smack into another group of well-wishing TOWNIES. Mrs. March is among them. She's holding an envelope. 
TOWNIE #1 Mrs. March wants to give you something. (to Mrs. March) He's right here, Irene. 
MRS. MARCH (re: letter) It's to my daughter Annie. She left five years ago. She was only fifteen. The last I heard, she was living up north... 
The Postman swallows hard, looks from the envelope to the faces around him, to Mrs. March. She looks blindly back. How can he lie to her? 
THE POSTMAN Look, Mrs. March, you should know that... 
MRS. MARCH Know what? 
THE POSTMAN Know that... 
But she stops him, grabs for his hand. 
MRS. MARCH I have a feeling about you. I know you'll do what's right. 
Her hand leaves his and she disappears into the crowd. She's left him with her letter and no choice at all. 
THE POSTMAN I got to get out of here. 
37   EXT. PINE VIEW - NIGHT                                         37 
The Postman moves through town. The streets are deserted. He's got his pack on, his mailbag. He passes a 7-11 converted to a blacksmith shop. There's a horse tethered to the railing in front of it. He grins; maybe he's going to make it out of here after all. As he starts to move toward the horse... 
OLD MAN (O.S.) It's right around the corner. 
An OLD MAN sits on his porch across the street. 
THE POSTMAN (freezes, startled) What is? 
OLD MAN What you're looking for. 
The Old Man winks knowingly, then heads inside. As The Postman turns the corner, he finds himself in front of the post office. An old brick building. Chiseled in the granite facing: "UNITED STATES POST OFFICE. EST. 1884." 
38   INT. POST OFFICE (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT                           38 
Long ago stripped, it still has a proud, official, almost holy feel. The Postman wanders in, stops to read the credo calligraphied on the wall. "Neither snow, nor rain..." He turns at a SOUND. Ford is here, leaning against a wall. 
FORD I knew you'd come here. 
THE POSTMAN You did, huh? 
Ford nods.    A sage sixteen-year-old. 
FORD How do you get to be a postman, anyhow? 
THE POSTMAN You have to be in the right place at the right time. 
FORD How could I do it? 
(CONTINUED) 
38   CONTINUED:                                                     38 
THE POSTMAN I thought you wanted to drive cars. 
FORD Not anymore. That was kid's stuff. This is real. So, where's the right place? 
THE POSTMAN Could be anywhere. Anytime. Only another postman can make you a postman. 
FORD Kinda like vampires, right? 
THE POSTMAN Something like that. You have to be sworn in. 
Ford raises his right hand, palm out, ready to take the oath. It takes The Postman a moment to realize. 
THE POSTMAN The organization's kinda shaky. It might not last. 
FORD What does?

Kimble looks at his cuffs. "In these?" Old Guard digs out his key ring and unlocks Kimble's hands - only his hands. Kimble opens medical kit. It's been ransacked - just Band-Aids now. Kimble looks into the wound. 
KIMBLE He isn't going to make it unless he gets to a hospital. Fast. 
OLD GUARD ZL. 
In this delicate moment a SHIVER runs through the bus. Is it just settling? 
With other things to worry about, Kimble tries to stop Young Guard's bleeding. 
ANGLE UNDER SEAT 
We see Copeland, alive. The crash has ripped the bars from a back window and shattered the glass. He works to get out the opening. 
BACK TO KIMBLE 
A second SHIVER ripples through the bus, stronger. Kimble retracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a growing vibration. 
KIMBLE Just where the hell are we? 
The Old Guard feels it too. He gets down on his knees and looks out one of the shattered, barred windows. 
OLD GUARD Oh, shit... 
EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT 
The bus lies across railroad tracks. A not-too-distant bend grows bright by the light of an approaching train. 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
Kimble sees: Old Guard fights the cage door. Kimble lunges to his side. 
KIMBLE It's locked. Where're your keys? 
EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT 
Downtrack, one Cyclops light appears. 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
Kimble spots keys. Pitches them to Old Guard. Drags Young Guard to the front for a quick exit. But Old Guard fumbles the key-ring, his hands shaking as much as the bus. 
The train light spider-webs across cracked windows. Kimble snatches the keys away from the Guard's trembling hands. 
KIMBLE Which one? This? This one?! 
Old Guard gulps a nod. Kimble jams a key in the lock. Throws the door open. Grabs Young Guard. 
KIMBLE Help me get him - 
But Old Guard climbs right over Kimble's back and climbs out the shattered windshield. 
ANGLE ON REAR OF BUS 
Copeland escapes through the hole in the back... 
EXT. BUS - NIGHT 
... and hits the ground running the other way. The locomotive's headlight reveals the toppled bus. 
INT. BUS - NIGHT 
Train light grows. A nanosecond of uncertainty: Should Kimble leave the wounded man? Kimble and the Young Guard hold a look. 
EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN - NIGHT 
As the WHEELS BRAKE and LOCK. 
EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT 
Kimble struggles out of the bus - pulling the Young Guard behind him. He slings the man clear. 
SCREECHING death, the TRAIN SKIDS closer. 
For one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus. 
The train light X-rays him. 
Kimble leaps. Lands. Rolls. Gains his feet. Tries to sprint away but can't: His feet are still chained. He gets off a dozen mincing steps before... 
IMPACT: A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS into the bus, splitting it open. 
Shrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his feet, still running feverish half-steps. 
An EXPLOSION envelops the train. Flames stream down its flanks. 
The train burns past the wounded Guard. 
Kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind him. But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life: 
Still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming after him. It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being chased by a fire-breathing locomotive. 
The train burrows to a stop. 
Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that nearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices something in his hand. 
It's the key-ring. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
Kimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key. Suddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key-ring away. 
COPELAND (O.S.) Give me that. 
Kimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his own chains. 
COPELAND You listen to me. I don't give a damn which way you go, just don't follow me. 
Kimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his arm and runs. Kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the other direction - crossing a hilltop in the moonlight.

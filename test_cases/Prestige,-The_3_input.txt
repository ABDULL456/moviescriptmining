ANGIER I don't understand- 
Tesla STARES at the hat as if trying to melt it with CONCENTRARION. Alley pulls Angier away from the pit. 
ALLEY Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it. We'll see you next week? 
Angier begins to protest but Alley gestures towards the door. 
INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY 
A small, disused shop off an arcade, crowed with tools, cabinetry and props, windows plastered with playbills. Borden is sitting at a workbench, sleeves rolled up, working a lathe. Fallon enters, Olivia behind him. Borden looks back at her, turns back to the table, instinctively putting on his gloves. 
OLIVIA 
(LOOKING AROUND) Interesting workshop. 
BORDEN We make do. 
OLIVIA My name is Olivia Wenscombe. 
BORDEN I know who you are. Are you here to steal the rest of my show? Olivia sees one of the theatrical notices that litter the shop: "THE GREAT DANTON BREAKS RECORD WITH HIS ASTONISHING 
NEW TRICK" 
OLIVIA No. I'm here to give your show what is missing. 
BORDEN And what might that be? 
OLIVIA Me. 
BORDEN 
(TO FALLON) Wasn't I just saying that, Bernard? A woman's touch. Fallon leaves, closing the door. 
OLIVIA I've left Angier. I want a job. Borden sits there. 
OLIVIA (CONT'D) I know you have no reason to trust 
ME- 
BORDEN Why on earth shouldn't I trust you? The mistress of my enemy. 
Olivia is taken aback. Chanes tack. 
OLIVIA Mr.Borden- 
BORDEN Alfred. 
OLIVIA Alfred. I'm going to tell you the truth. 
BORDEN Ah. The truth. A slippery notion in our life of work, Miss Wenscombe. 
OLIVIA I'm here because he sent me here. He wants me to come and work for you and steal your secret. 
BORDEN What does he need my secret for? His trick is top notch. The Great Danton vanishes and isntantly reappears on the other side of the stage -- mute, overweight, and, unless I'm mistaken, rather drunk. 
Borden rises, moves closer to Olivia. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) Tell me, Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage? 
Olivia meets his gaze. 
OLIVIA No. It's killing him. he's obsessed with discovering your method. He thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our sucess. I've had enough. There's no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his. 
BORDEN He has no secrets from me. 
Borden stares at her, unsure. 
BORDEN (CONT'D) And this is the truth? 
She gives Borden a challenging smile/shrug. 
INT. BACKSTAGE -- DAY 
Cutter is fixing a prop mechanism. Angier approaches, in his undershirt, looks over his shoulder. Cutter glances up. 
CUTTER Best be getting changed for the martinee, sir. - Angier nods. Cutter REALIZES. 
CUTTER (CONT'D) ROOT! You're late. 
(SNIFFS) And even more drunk than usual. Get yourself below stairs, right away! 
ROOT No. 
CUTTER No?! Root looks at Cutter with genuine malice. 
ROOT We need to have a chat, Mr.Cutter. 
INT. DRESSING ROOM -- DAY 
Angier is applying his makeup. Cutter enters. Angier looks at him through the mirror. 
ANGIER We have a problem, Cutter. He holds up the paper, folded to an advertisement: 
PANTAGES THEATRE- FROM NEXT WEEK- THE PROFESSOR WILL 
DEMONSTRATE THE ORIGINAL TRANSPORTED MAN- ACCEPT NO CHEAP 
IMITATIONS!!! 
ANGIER (CONT'D) He'll be perfoming right across the street. 
CUTTER We have a bigger problem. Root. 
ANGIER Don't tell me he fell over again. 
CUTTER Worse. He realized he can make demands.

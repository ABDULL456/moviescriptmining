JUDGE (he SLAMS his fist) Overruled!! 
MARGARET (she loses her temper) No! You're outrageous! Constantly criticizing! Wearing me down! Saying I'd be "knocked off" if I ever told the truth!! The Jury GASPS. Walter throws out his hands. 
WALTER Your HONOR! I ask for a mistrial! Both Keanes starts QUARRELING. The Judge STANDS. 
JUDGE HEY! This is not a domestic squabble! Or -- maybe it is. But the rest of us have no interest in watching you two go at it. Walter calms himself, contrite. 
WALTER I'm sorry for the emotions. I'm an artist. The Judge stares harshly. 
JUDGE Maybe. 
IN THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM Two SKETCH ARTISTS are busy, drawing the trial. One guy pokes the other one, to show off his work. His SKETCH is a typical courtroom drawing, except everyone is drawn with big ridiculous Keane eyes. The second guy GIGGLES. His buddy grins, then quickly erases the silly eyes before anyone sees it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. COURTROOM - LATER 
Margaret is back at the litigant's table, with her lawyer. 
Walter stands, at his table. He shouts out. 
WALTER I call as my witness... Mr. Walter Stanley Keane! A strange beat. The Jurors glance at each other. Walter reacts, like he just heard his name. He strides jauntily over to the witness stand. The BAILIFF gives the Judge a weird look. Then, he pulls out a Bible. Walter slaps down his hand. 
BAILIFF Do you swear to the tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? 
WALTER 
YESSS! Walter bounces out, a bit manic. He runs back to his lawyer table, then spins to address the empty witness stand. 
WALTER Mr. Keane. There has been a lot of innuendo and contradictory testimony about the genesis of the "big-eyed waifs." Would you mind clarifying to this court, once and for all, who spawned these paintings? Walter sprints back into the witness stand. He sits, then reacts coyly, as if he's surprised. 
WALTER Why -- I created the children. Walter starts to stand again -- but the Judge SLAMS his bench. 
JUDGE The choreography is not necessary. Just sit down and testify. Oh. Walter sits, then gathers his thoughts... We slowly PUSH IN. He smiles, wistfully... 
WALTER I've had a wonderful life. I've been an artist, a world traveler, a friend of untold celebrities... (he gets misty-eyed) But when I look back at it all, when I peer into my heart and define what mattered... 
(MORE) 
WALTER (CONT'D) it is that I was dedicated to the hungry children of the world. 
(GENUINE) It all began in Berlin. After World War II... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
LATER 
WALTER ...the orphans were clutching the barbed wire. Their bodies lacerated, their fingers scrawny, their eyes big and helpless. Imploring me, begging me... "Do something!" 
(HUSHED) "Do something."

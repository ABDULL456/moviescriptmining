Speeding toward Lincoln. FIRING PULSING WAVES OF ENERGY, lighting up the distant sky. 
INT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 
The marines and civilians fall into the large entryway. The marines are breathing hard, looking stunned. 
PVT. KERNS Goddamn flying saucers now...?! 
ADUKWU All those guys on the chopper... 
PVT. IMLAY Why'd those bastards have to come down here and start this shit?! 
SGT. NANTZ That is not relevant, Imlay! They're here. They're trying to kill us. Kill them first! Martinez eyes Nantz on this. Then barks orders: 
LT. MARTINEZ Secure the perimeter! Stavrou, give me an ammo check. Cpl. Correggio, take three men, set up an Observation Post on the roof. 
SGT. NANTZ You heard the lieutenant. Move! The dazed marines begin COVERING doors and hallways. We see in their FACES that it's a very different fight now. Nantz turns, can see the MEDEVAC ABLAZE out a window. His solemn stare hints at a growing desperation. Martinez steps up to him, looks out. Quietly: 
LT. MARTINEZ They got air power, too... Knocked that medevac right out of the sky. So much for ruling the air. Nantz just keeps staring out. 
LT. MARTINEZ Listen, Sergeant. These men are scared. A little compassion would go a long way... Nantz turns on Martinez now. 
SGT. NANTZ How's that gonna help them survive, Lieutenant? 
(BEAT) I'll lead these marines. But don't ask me to get close to them. Nantz walks off. 
INT. COMMUNITY CENTER LOBBY - MINUTES LATER 
Marines on post, watching various windows and doors. Imlay kneels by the kids, who look devastated by the day's events. Imlay wets a rag with water from his canteen, wiping the dust and dirt from the kids' faces. The younger girl, KIRSTEN, 8, begins crying. She suddenly hugs Imlay. Imlay, startled by this, looks uncomfortable at first. Then hugs the little girl back, smiling at the older.girl, ANY, 10, Kirsten's sister. 
AMY You're not gonna leave us, are you? A beat. Then Imlay smiles. 
PVT. IMLAY No way, sweetheart. The woman, Michele McDermott, is clearly rattled, struggling for composure, eyes constantly moving to the kids. Mr. Rincon, a calm, watchful air about him, stands with his son, HECTOR, the kid who Nantz had carried to the chopper. 
RINCON My son and I came here... There were only three cops, spread pretty thin... Then those things attacked. Police couldn't stop them. 
SGT. NANTZ What happened to everyone? 
RINCON I don't know. Most people ran. We hid in a side room, found Michele and the girls... Couldn't see what happened. Just heard... Screams. 
MICHELE I have my nieces for the week. My sister and her husband are in Hawaii for their anniversary... Is it safe there? I heard this is happening in other places... Martinez is at a loss for words. 
MICHELE What do they want from us? Why are they here? 
LT. MARTINEZ I...don't know. Right now, our job is just to get you to safety, okay? Harris appears from the hallway. 
CPL. HARRIS Lieutenant, something you should see... 
EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER / BACK DOOR - MOMENTS LATER 
The door opens. Nantz and Martinez edge out with Harris. As they peer into the smoke drifting past the building, an IMAGE becomes clear... An ALIEN BODY. On the ground nearby. Ripped by bullets. They step to it cautiously, realizing... IT'S NOT QUITE DEAD! The alien MOVES, turning as if to stare back at them. Without a word, Nantz lifts his rifle, shoots it in the head.

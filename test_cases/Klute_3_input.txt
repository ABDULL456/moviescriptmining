INT. STAIRWELL: KLUTE - DAY 
Klute's manner, over the next few minutes, exhibits an absolute, untheatrical, care and competence. A man -- Cable -- may in fact be hiding here somewhere to kill him. He sets about checking the likely places -- first of all the lower hallway, then the stairwell itself, moving steadily unalarmedly up. 
At the top he notes -- but still without main concern that Bree's door is open. He calls ahead -- 
KLUTE Bree -- 
INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY 
He enters, puzzles, starts checking around (quite thoroughly; she might be hiding from him). We CUT BACK TO -- 
EXT. STREETS: BREE; FIGURE OF CABLE - DAY 
Bree moves past CONSTRUCTION WORK, through one of those temporary pedestrian passageways. Behind her, nearer than before we see the FIGURE OF CABLE. 
INT. STAIRWELL - DAY 
Klute comes quickly back downstairs, back into his room, takes up the phone. Through the still-open door we watch him begin dialing -- then CUT TO -- 
INT. SPANGLER'S (OUTER) OFFICE - DAY 
Bree sits isolated on the waiting-room couch. She may have been here for fifteen minutes -- or an hour. She turns the pages of a magazine -- one handed, without even lifting it from the coffee table, with an absolute lack of interest, a mechanical gesture. 
We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching directly toward where we are watching Bree sit. 
LELA (O.S.) Mrs. Daniel -- 
WIDER - TWO SHOT 
Bree looks up in a kind of frozen terror, as the Secretary smiles nicely -- lovingly down at her. 
LELA -- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he -- 
BREE No. 
LELA Well I have to close up now. 
BREE Look -- could I use your phone? 
LELA Yes indeed. 
BREE Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone. 
LELA (the same tone, completely) Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me. 
Bree moves to the desk and telephone. But we move with the Secretary as she moves into Spangler's inner office and switches out the lights (establishing TIME CHANGE: dusk now) and as we hear, O.S., the sound of DIALING and BREE'S VOICE -- 
BREE (O.S.) Is Mr. Faber there? (beat) Mr. Faber Senior. 
INT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER'S OFFICE: FABER - DAY (NIGHT) 
Mr. Faber's phone buzzes; he picks it up. 
FABER Yes? (then, glancing about) Bree? 
INT. SPANGLER (OUTER) OFFICE: BREE ON PHONE - DAY (NIGHT) 
BREE (haltingly) -- I'm -- I just have to talk to someone. I'm just a little way across town -- 
FABER, ON PHONE (OFFICE) 
FABER Yes - yes dear, yes -- maybe half an hour, sure, yes. 
He hangs up. An ancient stirring, a kind of triumph. He glances about, then tightens his tie. Then it comes to him, after all -- he takes note of himself -- he leans forward against his desk and rubs his forehead with old bony fingers. We CUT TO 
INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY (NIGHT) 
KLUTE on phone. 
KLUTE Trina, will you call me if you hear from, her? Will you check other people she might call? Yeah, if it wasn't trouble I wouldn't ask vou.

Kroot's beady eyes widen and he comes back. 
KROOT What? What did you say? 
STEVE I said go kiss a duck, marblehead. 
Kroot is stunned and people have stopped dancing to watch 
MR. KROOT Bolander--you're suspended. You're-- don't even come Monday. You are out! 
STEVE (smiling broadly) I graduated last semester. 
Suddenly everything has changed. Mr. Kroot is furious, but unable to do anything. He finally storms off in a huff. Steve, Laurie and the people watching all laugh. 
STEVE (to Laurie) Get your shoes. Let's go before we get thrown out. 
THE GYM PARKING LOT 
Steve and Laurie walk toward her Edsel. In the background Wolfman Jack is taking a phone call from someone. 
MAN (V.O.) Hello, Wolfman. 
WOLFMAN (V.O.) Who's this? 
MAN This is Weird Willard. 
WOLFMAN Hold on a minute, let me get my pants off... you understand? 
Steve opens the door to the car and then turns Laurie and kisses her. 
STEVE Why don't we go to the canal? 
LAURIE (teasing) What for? 
STEVE Listen, I can get tough with you too, you know. 
LAURIE Yeah, hard tough. 
She kisses him and they get into the car. As they pull out, the Wolfman continues his conversation on the radio. 
WOLFMAN (V.O.) I got 'em down around my knees, man. Wear these tight pants. I can't get 'em... All right, I'm gonna do my little dance now, man. 
And the Wolfman goes into an insane rain-dance rhythm as we hear "Little Darlin'" 
CRUISING MAIN STREET--STEVE'S '58 CHEVY 
Terry not only looks cool now, but is cool, singing with the radio, a girl beside him. Hot stuff. 
Terry ever so slowly tries to put his arm around her, but by the time he manages it, he has to shift. 
They drive by some kids having a car-to-car water pistol war. 
TERRY I go to Dewey too, ya know. 
DEBBIE I never seen ya. 
TERRY I bug out a lot. When I graduate, I'm going to join the Marines. 
DEBBIE They got the best uniforms. But what if there's a war? 
TERRY With the bomb, who's going to start it? We'd all blow up together. Anyway, I'd rather be at the front. I'm like that--rather be where the action is, you know. Once I got in a fight with-- 
DEBBIE I love Eddie Burns. 
Terry stops, trying to figure out where their conversation went. 
TERRY Eddie Burns--oh, yeah, Eddie Burns. I met him once, too. 
DEBBIE You really think I look like Connie Stevens? I like her--Tuesday Weld is too much of a beatnik, don't you think? 
TERRY Yeah, beatniks are losers. 
DEBBIE Who do you like? I mean, singers and stuff. 
Terry slowly maneuvers his arm around her. 
TERRY Ah hell--I like most of the people you like. 
DEBBIE (putting her head on his shoulder) That's nice--we got a lot in common. 
Both of them start singing with the radio. Suddenly she puts her hand on his leg.

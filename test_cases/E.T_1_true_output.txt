"You could be happy here. I could take care of you," says Elliott tearfully. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. We could grow up together, E.T." 
[Elliott states his primary objective: to always have E.T. with him.] 
"Home, Home," says E.T. 
[E.T. states his primary objective: to go home.] 
Elliott sits down and cries. E.T. touches one of his tears. 
[The audience empathizes with the sadness of both characters.] 
EXT: FOREST: NIGHT 
It's morning. Elliott is asleep as he leans against a large rock. He is covered with a blanket as the wet forest mist surrounds him. Next to him lies E.T.'s communication device. 
Elliott coughs, gets up, tugs on the rope which activates the device, then looks around for E.T. but can't find him. 
[The new objective: where is E.T. and what has happened to him? This is also the new question that will maintain the audience's interest.] 
INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY 
Mary opens the refrigerator door and puts back a carton of milk. Mike and Gertie sit besides her. A policeman asks Mary how Elliott was dressed when she last saw him. Mary tells him that he was dressed as a hunchback. The policeman, whose face is not shown (I suppose so that the audience will associate him as "one of them"), asks Mary if there is any indication that he might have run away? Were there any family problems or recent arguments? Mary explains that she and her husband had just separated and that this has not been easy on the kids. 
"My father is in Mexico," says Gertie. 
[This scene generates empathy for the whole family.] 
Mary slams the refrigerator door shut, thereby revealing Elliott standing behind it. White light floods onto him making him look ghastly. Mary hugs him as Mike and Gertie join them. 
[The audience is relieved and overjoyed with Elliott's safe return.] 
"Oh Elliott," she says as she hugs him. "Don't ever do this again, Elliott. You're so hot."

with envelope. WINSTON And the winner is... Rachel Marron for Queen Of The Night. FLASH CUT TO: 
FRANK'S FACE grim.   He looks past the curtain to Rachel. FRANK'S POV - AUDITORIUM Deafening applause in the main auditorium. A stunned Rachel stands. Devaney and Spector kiss her. People nearby reach out to touch her. Rachel walks along her row. The orchestra plays "I Have Nothing." 
212   INT. BACKSTAGE - OPPOSITE WINGS - NIGHT                      212 A mass of drapes and flats. Behind them, the cameraman is fixing something to the side of his camera. His back is to us. Tony comes up briskly behind him, unable to see his face. TONY Hey! You! What the fuck you think you're doin' back here... With amazing speed, the cameraman - Portman - wheels around, simultaneously jabbing two outstretched fingers from his free hand straight into Tony's eyes. Tony cries out, his hands flying to his face. Portman's hand moves swiftly again, jabbing to a nerve behind Tony's ear, Tony drops like a sack. Glancing rapidly around, Portman sees all other eyes on the auditorium. He pulls the curtain around Tony's body - obscuring it. He then removes his own "SECURITY" ID and fixes a laminated "PRESS" ID to his lapel. 
213   INT. BACKSTAGE - STAGE RIGHT WINGS - NIGHT                   213 Frank gestures animatedly to the head of security and several guards. The music and the applause drown out his words and we do not hear them. The guards rush off backstage and into the auditorium. 
214   INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                                 214 
Rachel walks along her row. Hands reach out to her. Some people stand in their seats around her. A crane- mounted TV camera swoops down between Frank and his view of Rachel, obscuring her for a brief instant. CLOSE ON FRANK'S FACE 
Desperately scanning, seeking.   Suddenly his face freezes. FRANK'S POV As Rachel reaches the center aisle and starts to walk toward the steps, there in the far aisle, his face almost hidden, is Portman -- the camera, hand-held on his shoulder, moving level with Rachel, 20 feet behind her. 
Frank raises his gun. 
AISLE Rachel walks down the aisle toward the side steps. Tears in her eyes. Thunderous applause. Security guards in the side aisles look around in all directions. They can't see anything. FRANK'S POV TIGHT ON Portman, now almost completely obscured behind the members of the audience, as more and more of them stand to applaud Rachel. PORTMAN'S POV ALONG THE SIDE OF THE CAMERA. Rachel keeps appearing and disappearing behind the heads of the audience. FRANK IN THE WINGS Desperate to get a clear shot at Portman but unable to fire without hitting a bystander. FROM STAGE RIGHT WINGS - FRANK'S POV OF RACHEL as she  approaches the podium, steadily, controlling herself  as she mounts the steps. The outline of her body becomes  difficult to see against the glare of the foot- lights  and the lights at the side of the auditorium. FRANK'S FACE His eyes squint against the dazzle. ON STAGE - PODIUM Rachel approaches Winston.   The applause and music is 
deafening. FRANK'S FACE He can't see Portman past the glare. He can't fire into the audience. He knows Rachel is now at her most vulner- able. There is only one thing he can do to protect his charge. BACKSTAGE WINGS Frank runs on stage at terrific speed and leaps through the air at Rachel, twisting his body as he does. 
ON STAGE - PODIUM 
Rachel turns her head, sees Frank leaping at her and gasps out with a mixture of fury and terror. RACHEL No! CLOSE ON PORTMAN The silenced PISTOL taped to the side of the camera FIRES. ONCE. TWICE. ON STAGE Frank and Rachel tumble over on the floor. The podium topples. There are screams from the audience. AUDITORIUM Pandemonium breaks out. Men run on stage from all directions. Guns are drawn. Everyone is shouting. TV cameras whip-pan in all directions, security men shout into walkie-talkies. QUICK CUT TO: 215   INT. MOBILE TV CONTROL VAN - NIGHT                           215 Chaos on all screens. TV DIRECTOR What the fuck? OTHER VOICE (O.S.) Go to commercial...

SABATINI I'd like to introduce you to Tom Martinez. 
MARTINEZ Very impressive performance today. In my job as the national cross-checker for the New York Mets, I see the top 200 players in the United States. It's been a while since I've seen a five tools guy, the complete package. Your throwing ability, your fielding skills... Ed told me you had power but I had no idea it was of the light tower variety. I hope you're as interested in professional baseball as we are in acquiring you in the upcoming draft. 
BILLY Well, sir, I'd need to talk it out with my parents, decide if baseball is something I want to do full time. I have a scholarship to play football at Stanford. 
MARTINEZ Well, Billy, we're certainly looking forward to meeting your folks and talking to them as well. And we believe in college, but that's something you can do in the winter months. You need to know the sky's the limit with your ability. You could be a superstar before you've even graduated. But to get to that level, you need to work with our people. Pro-ball is where you need to be to develop the skills God gave you. 
CUT TO: 
16 INT. RECEPTION - INDIANS CORPORATE OFFICES - DAY 16 
Unlike the A's, this is a franchise that can spend actual money on players, and on nice lobby furniture, which is where Billy sits, staring at a classic baseball photo that hangs in the lobby. 
ASSISTANT Mr. Beane? Mark's ready to see you now.

18 INT. MARK SHAPIRO'S OFFICE - CLEVELAND - DAY 18 
Billy's counterpart in Cleveland--Indians General Manager MARK SHAPIRO--35 and about three weeks into the job--sits behind his desk in a tie and shirt sleeves like Billy. Joining them in the room are FOUR OTHERS, including PETER 
BRAND. 
SHAPIRO So Billy, what are you looking for? 
BILLY 50 million in additional payroll. 
SHAPIRO Try Giambi. 
BILLY Ouch. 
SHAPIRO 120 million. 
BILLY I should've been a hitter. 
SHAPIRO Where's Steve in all this? 
BILLY Supportive. Excited about rebuilding the team. 
SHAPIRO Bonds is available. 
BILLY Yeah, how do I afford the rest of the field? 
SHAPIRO So what are you looking for? I want to help out. 
BILLY I guess you've touched the bottom of the sports industry when your opponent is 
OFFERING YOU-- 
SHAPIRO 
BILLY-- 
BILLY I need a lefty reliever and I want Ricardo Rincon. 
SHAPIRO Not going to happen. 
BILLY Not even a discussion? 
SHAPIRO Come on Billy, even if you could afford him we're not about to let him go. 
BILLY Why's that? You've got the Venezuelan kid in North Carolina you're bringing up. 
SHAPIRO We dished him to Detroit. Keep up. 
BILLY Well there goes my other idea. 
SHAPIRO What else you thinking Billy? 
BILLY You have any outfielders I should be looking at? 
SHAPIRO To replace Damon? 
BILLY Yeah. 
SHAPIRO That's a tough one Billy. 
BILLY Yeah. Who do you got? 
SHAPIRO The guys you might be able to afford? Hollins, Garcia... Coste. 
BILLY Tell me about Garcia. 
SHAPIRO To replace Damon?! 
BILLY Is he healthy? 
SHAPIRO He had a back thing, some minor surgery, but he's okay. Petey? 
PETEY He'll be good by Spring Training. 
BILLY He'll do. I can give you Guthrie for him if you kick in some cash. 
SHAPIRO Mark Guthrie? 
As Shapiro and gang review Guthrie's stats, Billy notices Peter whispering to the guy next to him. Shapiro looks around the room at the guys who don't object. 
SHAPIRO How much are you thinking? 
BILLY 
200 K. 
BRUCE approaches Shapiro and whispers and steps away. 
SHAPIRO Sorry about that. So... Garcia is going to be a no. What else are you thinking about? 
BILLY Let's make it work, I'll go straight up with you, Garcia for Guthrie, no kicker. 
Shapiro looks to Bruce, Peter is covering his mouth with his hand but we can just barely hear him whisper the word 'no'. Bruce subtly shakes his head to Mark. 
SHAPIRO Sorry Billy, who else you interested in? 
19 INT. INDIANS CORPORATE OFFICES - DAY 19 
Peter sits at his cubicle absorbed in his computer until he notices Billy hovering over him. 
BILLY Hey. 
PETER Hi.

BILLY So what do you do? (pointing at co-

GEORGES (with a slight smile) OK. 
ANNE Did you buy the new book on Harnoncourt? 
GEORGES I've already read it. 
ANNE And? 
GEORGES Do you want it? I'll get it for you. 
ANNE Sure. 
He goes out of the room to fetch the book. She remains lying there, waiting, and runs her healthy left hand through her hair to make herself look prettier, then smooths out the blanket that has slipped out of place a little. After a while, we hear Georges shouting. 
GEORGES (O.S.) I don't know where I put it. 
ANNE Don't worry. It isn't that important. 
GEORGES (O.S.) Yes, it is. Hold on, maybe it's in the... Just a moment! Viola! Here you are! Nothing like an infallible memory! 
She smiles, looks in his direction. He enters with the book in his hand. 
GEORGES (CONT'D) I thought I'd left it over there in the other room, but I'd already put it away. Tidy people just can't help being tidy. 
ANNE (taking the book) Thanks. 
She puts the book on her stomach. Looks at Georges. 
ANNE (CONT'D) Right now, take care of yourself. And don't wait to see how I hold the book in my hand, OK? 
GEORGES OK. 
He looks at her for a moment longer, then leaves the bedroom. She waits till he's outside. Tries to relax. Then she remembers the book. She takes it in her left hand and tries to open it. It's not easy for her. 
Then she notices that she's forgotten her glasses. She rests the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on the night stand. In the end, she manages it. Then she opens the book again, and tries to read. 
SCENE 14 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
The superintendent's wife puts the filled supermarket bags on the counter. Takes the stack of mail that she had put on top of one of the bags and puts it down beside them. Then she takes out the receipt and the change. 
SUPERINTENDANT'S WIFE Unfortunately the strawberries were already moldy. I'll go and get you some fresh ones tomorrow from the market. My husband will bring you the bottled water this afternoon. I'm not supposed to carry anything heavy: my back, you know... 
GEORGES Sure, no problem. 
SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE It came to 76 euros and 40 cents. There's the till receipt and here's your change: 23 euros 60.

CUBE (CONT'D) You believe in love at first sight? 
KIM What you think? 
She is the only one that can get Cube to smile at this point. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
B71   INT. PRIORITY RECORDS - BRYAN TURNER'S OFFICE - DAY         B71 
Cube, Kim by his side, is seated opposite Bryan Turner -- who's floored by the news. 
BRYAN Wow, you're really leaving the group... 
CUBE Yeah, I'm tired of the games. Eazy puts everything on Jerry and Jerry puts everything on Eazy. They can have it. 
BRYAN How do you feel about that Kim? Is he making a big mistake? 
KIM I don't think so-- after hearing everything that happened, I would've left too. Now he has the chance to showcase all his talents. 
BRYAN Well, I believe in you Cube, so I'll tell ya what: there's not a lot of money in this right now, but if this first record hits, I'll make it up to you on the next one. 
Cube gets up and shakes Bryan's hand. 
CUBE Well get ready--   `cause these albums are gonna   be comin' real fast. I'm hungry   and I got a lot to say that's gonna   fuck the world up. 
BRYAN TURNER Who're you gonna get to produce? Ruthless is probably gonna veto Dre working on the project. So what's your plan? 
CUBE If I can't get the best producer in the in the west. I gotta go get the best in the east. 
Off Cube's determined look-- 
HARD CUT TO: 
SUPERIMPOSE: SIX MONTHS LATER - NEW YORK CITY 
71   INT. GREENE STREET STUDIO - NEW YORK CITY - DAY              71 
CUBE, rocking a LENCH MOB JACKET, spitting new lyrics into the mic with crazy energy, a stack of notebooks on the chair beside him. It's the creation of NIGGA YA LOVE TO HATE -- 
CUBE Kickin' shit called street knowledge. Why more niggas in the pen than in college? Now cause of that line I might be your cellmate. That's from the nigga ya love to hate. 
IN THE MIXING BOOTH: CHUCK D -- Pittsburgh Pirates hat, brim low, PUBLIC ENEMY on his jacket -- along with the SHOCKLEES, JINX and DA LENCH MOB plus 2 members of the FRUIT OF ISLAM, Security and KIM. Everyone exchanging looks, impressed. 
ON A SUSPENDED TV in the corner, we see LOUIS FARRAKHAN preaching to a crowd of F.O.I. It's clear this is a very different world than the one Cube left behind in L.A. 
72   INT./EXT. DRE'S LOW RIDER - EAZY'S HOUSE - DAY               72 
The completed version of NIGGA YA LOVE TO HATE POUNDS out of the SPEAKERS in DRE's ride as he pulls up to Eazy's crib. 
CUBE TRACK (FUCK YOU ICE CUBE!) Yeah, HA-HA! I'm the nigga ya love to hate -- 
Dre chuckles to himself in disbelief. Shit is dope. On the SEAT beside him, a CD with the plastic freshly torn off -- It's Ice Cube's AMERIKKKA'S MOST WANTED. 
73   EXT. EAZY'S HOUSE - CALABASAS - DAY                          73 
There's a PARTY going on at Eazy's huge new mansion, reminiscent of Scarface's estate. And the gang's all here, everyone we know... except for Cube. Over by the poolside gazebo, JERRY talks with a troubled EAZY. 
EAZY Cube's record's in the Billboard top 20! Our shit never even came close to that. He's blowin' the fuck up -- 
JERRY It's gonna be fine, Eric. It's not just NWA anymore, it's our whole Ruthless roster. (MORE) 
JERRY (CONT'D) We've got D.O.C., we've got Michel'le, we've got Above the Law. We're moving up to the next level. 
EAZY We gotta keep Dre happy. Keep him motivated. 
Eazy looks over at DRE, across the pool -- He's DANCING with three drop-dead BEAUTIFUL GIRLS. Dre's smile is massive. He clearly loves this sweet life. 
JERRY Look at him. You think he needs anymore motivation than that? 
EAZY Yeah I get it. He drownin' in pussy. But that don't mean -- 
JERRY You gotta stop worrying so much. Let me do the worrying for you. Fact is, Ren can write just as good as Cube. Maybe even better. Come over here a minute -- 
Eazy follows Jerry to a TABLE where he's set up a bunch of CHECKS and PAPERS, and he hands Eazy a PEN. 
JERRY (CONT'D) Need your autograph on these checks and a few other things. Just sign right here -- 
Eazy starts SIGNING, even though his eyes keep drifting over to the many WOMEN partying. Jerry GRINS, noticing how quickly Eazy gets distracted. 
EAZY We done with this shit now? 
JERRY We're done. 
EAZY Thanks, Jerry. I'mma go fuck now. 
Jerry laughs, slaps Eazy on the back as he walks off, and stands there enjoying the sunshine, the pretty girls, the party vibe. His eyes wander to the PORCH, where -- 
SUGE KNIGHT is standing, smoking a cigar. And Suge is STARING at Jerry, his expression blank. Almost like he's studying Jerry. The old man stops smiling, deeply unsettled. Luckily -- 
DRE APPROACHES SUGE, breaking the big dawg's gaze. 
DRE Wuddup, Suge -- You good? 
SUGE Are you? 
Off Dre's confused look -- 
SUGE (CONT'D) Just figured you might be a bit fucked up after hearin' Cube's shit. 
DRE Fucked up about what? I been bangin' that shit.

MARK Jesse cooked his. They both laugh. 
LARGE Why's it brown? 
MARK 'Cause my wife was Tanisha Lubin. 
LARGE Oh. Large laughs at Mark's earnestness. 
LARGE (CONT'D) You kept her little blue skirt on. 
MARK He's a boy. His name's Shantel. 
LARGE It's a girl, she's wearin' a skirt. 
MARK They're shorts. 
LARGE Shorts? 
MARK Yeah, he's a boy, Shantel. They're shorts. 
LARGE Oh. They laugh. Large flips through an album. 
LARGE (CONT'D) You collect "Desert Storm Trading Cards"? 
MARK Fuck yeah, dude. Those are collectors items. Do you have any idea how much those things will be worth some day. 
LARGE Really? 
MARK Hell yeah. That shit's like an investment. I have lots of little investments - all over the place. I'm gonna sel3. 'em all one day and just live off 'em. 
LARGE So like how much is this one worth? 
MARK Which? 
LARGE "Night Vision Goggles." 
MARK I don't know. Mint; maybe two, three. 
LARGE Dollars? 
MARK Yeah. But it's too early. You don't sell'em yet. Don't you know anything about investing. I'm gonna live off that shit. That "Schwarzkopf" card is worth at least five something. And if you have the complete set it's worth like thousands. 
LARGE So do you have the complete set? 
MARK Almost. The corners are bent on my "Friendly Fire" and someone stole my "Wolf Blitzer". 
LARGE Someone stole it? 
MARK One of my Mom's Medieval Times friends, man. Drug addicts. 
LARGE For drugs they sold it? 
MARK Yeah. 
LARGE Wolf Blitzer. 
MARK It doesn't matter if you're a rich house wife looking for your muscle relaxers or some crack head drying cars: people will do anything in this town to get their drug money. Now look, what do you gotta do today? I gotta little going away present for you. But I kinds gotta track it down. So, can you give me a ride? 
LARGE Yeah, sure I just... 
MARK What? 
LARGE Nothing I just... 
MARK Say it... speak. 
LARGE Nothing I just, I told Sam I was gonna hang out with her today... 
MARK She can come, I don't care. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS- DAY 
GREAT MUSIC PLAYS. They drive the motorcycle through the Jersey suburbs; Sate on the back and Mark in the sidecar wearing a lacrosse helmet and ski goggles. LARGE'S POV: A mother and her stroller. A huge group of Black teenagers coming home from school. An old crossing guard. An ambulance. Two powerwalkere.

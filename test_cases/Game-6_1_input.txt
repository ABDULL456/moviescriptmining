Wide of the theater. Nicky says goodbye to Paisley. 
Reverse angle, Elliot watches them from across the street. 
icky goes back inside the theatre. Paisley walks west on 47th street. 
Elliot waits for a moment, then follows her. 
INT. STEVEN SCHWIMMER'S LOFT The Port-O-San. Steven emerges and goes to the stacked cardboard boxes against the wall. His hate mail. He is wearing a bath towel like a prayer shawl over his sweat clothes. 
He drags one of the boxes to the ratty armchair. He sits in the chair by the filthy window that looks west toward the early-setting sun. 
He takes a letter from the box, opens it, reads it, lets it fall to the floor. Takes another letter, opens it -- 
There is a knock at the door. 
Steven tenses, does not move. 
Another knock. 
He moves warily toward the door. 
PAISLEY (V.O.) Steven, it's me. Will you open please. 
Steven releases the dead-bolt lock and opens the door. 
STEVEN You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day. 
PAISLEY I haven't come to you. 
STEVEN But you're here. So you must have come to me. 
INT. STEVEN SCHWIMMER'S LOFT - A LITTLE LATER 
Steven is back in the chair by the window. Paisley nervously prowls the loft. 
PAISLEY In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair. 
STEVEN Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs. 
PAISLEY Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently. 
STEVEN The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims. reaching down to clutch a fistful of letters) Look how they hate me for telling the truth. It's an education, Paisley. The College of Raw Nerves. (MORE) 
STEVEN(cont'd) Letters dripping blood. Cries of revenge. 
PAISLEY Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider. 
STEVEN And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me. 
PAISLEY I don't want you, Steven. 
Paisley moves towards the door. 
TEVEN Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.

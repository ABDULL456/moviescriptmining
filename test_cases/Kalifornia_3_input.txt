Of Early and Carrie as they are let into the house. 
INT. LINCOLN 
Adele is still rambling on about her interest in cacti. 
ADELE ...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years. 
BRIAN Adele for god sake please lis... 
ADELE (she glances over to Brian) There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that. 
Adele drifts back to the cacti. 
INT. MUSGRAVE LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 
CLOSE ON A PORCELAIN CACTUS 
One of many we now reveal to be atop a fireplace mantle. Adele leans in against the mantle and scrutinizes the cactus. 
Carrie and Brian sit on the floor, back to back, their arms bound around the leg of a piano by a pair of police handcuffs. Mrs. Musgrave is standing nearby. She's overwhelmed. Numb. She pours herself a glass of bourbon. 
MRS. MUSGRAVE (to herself) It's just like in that dream I had. If only I had seen their faces. 
She takes her drink and sits down on the couch nearby. Adele drops down quietly on the chair next to her. 
ADELE (tries to cheer Mrs. Musgrave up) You've got beautiful cactuses here, I just love 'em. My momma used to keep a garden. 
Mrs. Musgrave downs most of her drink with the first try. Distressed, her head slumps down. 
EARLY (O.S.) (from the kitchen) Hey Bri... You ever stop to think that if you switched the two letters in your name... (entering the room) ...it would spell Brain. 
Early, his pistol wedged in his belt, appears from the kitchen eating a sandwich. Between bites... He walks over and rips the phone out of the wall unit. He glimpses Mrs. Musgrave. 
EARLY What's wrong with her? 
ADELE (sorry for her) She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen. 
Early notices the glass of bourbon in her trembling hands. He steps over to her and takes the glass away. 
EARLY I'll bet she did. 
He sets the glass down next to a recent picture of Mrs. Musgrave and an ELDERLY MAN with silver hair. 
EARLY Where's your husband? 
MRS. MUSGRAVE (lying) ...I'm a widow. 
Early looks at her, he doesn't believe her. 
EXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Everything is quiet beneath the star studded sky. The same elderly man pictured with Mrs. Musgrave is studying the sky through a powerful telescope. MR. MUSGRAVE is an amateur astronomer. o.s. the SOUND of a door opening. Then footsteps. 
MR. MUSGRAVE (excited) Is that you Peaches? Come, you must see Saturn tonight. The rings are sensational! 
INT. STUDY - GLASS DISPLAY CASE 
Early leans into frame, staring at the display case. 
EARLY'S POV 
Inside of it is a four foot long replica of the first ATOMIC BOMB, "Fat Boy." Faded newspaper articles on the wall indicate Mr. Musgrave had something to do with the bomb's initial construction. An old photo on the bookshelf shows a much younger Mr. Musgrave in a '50's kitchen. He is laughing and embracing a '50's style female mannequin. 
MR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.) My oh my, this is quite rare, quite rare indeed. Come have a look... 
Early's eyes drift over to a set of golf clubs that sit in the corner of the room. 
MR MUSGRAVE'S POV - THROUGH TELESCOPE 
The planet Saturn and its glorious rings. 
MR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.) Peaches? 
OMITTED 
THWACK!! The planet turns into a blur of light... then blackness. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - ON BRIAN AND CARRIE 
Brian and Carrie are still cuffed to the piano, in the background we see Mrs. Musgrave and Adele looking out the window into the backyard. 
BRIAN (whispers to Carrie) You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you. 
CARRIE I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work. 
BRIAN Then try again, (it's our only chance.) 
EXT. HOUSE - LATER 
Early is leaning on a golf club looking through the telescope. 
ADELE (O.S.) Early? 
He pulls his eye away as Adele arrives.

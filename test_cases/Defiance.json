{"train": "DEFIANCE \nWritten by \nClayton Frohman & Edward Zwick \nFADE IN: \n1 NEW YORK CITY - PARK AVENUE - NIGHT - 1982 1 A TAXI pulls over to a curb where an ELDERLY MAN waits with his MIDDLE-AGED SON in THE RAIN. \nMIDDLE-AGED SON (as they climb in) 23rd and Lex. The CABBIE grunts a reply. \nMIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D) How ya doin', Papa, you doin' alright? \nELDERLY MAN Fine, fine... \nMIDDLE-AGED SON This is just a check-up, okay? Doctor Katz says you'll outlive us all. (looks out the window) Traffic isn't bad. We should be back in time to watch the Mets. He notices his father is STARING, wide-eyed, at the cabby's HACK LICENSE. We glimpse only the last name...\"Bielski.\" \nMIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D) Papa? .Papa, what is it? IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, the old man catches the furtive eyes of the cabby. \nELDERLY MAN ...You. Can it be? The eyes in the mirror look away. And then back. \nELDERLY MAN (CONT'D) Bielski. Can it possibly be? As we PUSH IN on the eyes in the mirror, we HEAR THE \nDESPERATE RASPING SOUND OF PANTING. \nCUT TO: \n2 A MAN RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE THROUGH THE WOODS. 2 Bombs EXPLODE all around as he passes dead bodies and BURNT- OUT VEHICLES. Without slowing he discards a WW II Red Army helmet, a field jacket, a heavy pack, anything that might impede his flight. He glances back up over his shoulder. The sky is filled with BOMBERS. He runs on. \nSALMON Revision - 8-18-07 2. \n3 OMITTED 3 \n4 THE VILLAGE OF NALIBOKI 4 A typical Eastern European shtetl. LOCAL POLICE help German Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing squads, round up Jews. PEASANTS beat them with sticks as they are herded into lines. One man tries to run and is beaten. Others look on, or look away with indifference as they are loaded onto waiting trucks. \n5 TWO MEN HIDE IN THE NEARBY WOODS (ZUS & ASAEL BIELSKI) 5 We study their faces: a turbulent portrait of impotent rage, terrible fear, overwhelming grief, and secret relief. \nASAEL Where are they taking them? \nZUS --Shveig! Shveig! \nASAEL \nBUT-- \nZUS Just shut up! Please... \n6 AN ALLEY WAY IN NOVAGRUDOK 6 The man we last saw in flight (TUVIA BIELSKI) wearing the remnants of his uniform, slips down a cobble-stoned street. He ducks into a doorway as A PATROL passes by. \n6A A REMOTE FARM 6A Zus and Asael move warily through a barnyard. A tethered dog BARKS furiously. A farmer challenges them. \nWALENCKI (in Russian; subtitles) \nWHAT DO YOU WANT? Walencki brandishes a pitchfork. \nASAEL (in Russian; subtitles) Some food...? \nWALENCKI They are looking for you people. The two brothers glance nervously around. \nWALENCKI (CONT'D) Get away from here! GO! ZUS, the older of the two brothers, takes a menacing step toward the farmer but his younger brother holds him back. \n(CONTINUED) \nSALMON Revision - 8-19-07 3. \n6A CONTINUED: 6A \nASAEL Zus. Let's go. As they retreat toward the woods, Zus warns the farmer. \nZUS We'll be back. \n7 A BOURGEOIS APARTMENT -- DAY 7 Tuvia is getting dressed as AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN -- his wife, RIFKA -- stands by the window, smoking a cigarette. \nTUVIA And no news of my brothers? \nRIFKA They are used to trouble, they'll be all right. \nTUVIA If you stay, you'll have to go to the ghetto. \nRIFKA I can get false papers and pass as a gentile. So can you. Tuvia shakes his head, no. He finishes dressing. Theirs is a relationship long past passion. \nRIFKA (CONT'D) Will you at least stay tonight? \nTUVIA I need to see to my family. Will you come? \nRIFKA To the country? No. \nCUT TO: \nTUVIA Is there anything left to eat? Only a few potatoes in Asael's bag. WORMS writhe among them. \nASAEL Zus finished the last of the sausage. Tuvia glares at Zus, who glares back. Sibling rivals. \nZUS Stankowicz' farm is closest. \nASAEL He has dogs. \nZUS Fuck the dogs. Wilencki then. \nTUVIA You think Wilencki is going to give us food? \nZUS No. We take it. \nTUVIA How? \nZUS We...Take...It. \n(CONTINUED) \nSALMON Revision - 8-18-07 7. \n14 CONTINUED: 14 \nTUVIA And he tells the police. \nZUS I have run from the police my whole life. Do you really think it's a good time to stop? A moment of decision. Who holds the balance of power? \nASAEL We know these woods. They'll never find us in here. Tuvia looks at his brothers. He has been outvoted. \nCUT TO: \n15 THE SMALL FARMHOUSE 15 where Zus and Asael first tried to get food. Asael waits outside, anxiously on guard. \n16 INSIDE 16 The farmer (WALENCKI) who threatened them with the pitchfork sits eating a simple dinner. Zus and Tuvia burst in. Zus brandishes a hoe. \nZUS (in Russian; subtitles) We want food. Be quick about it! \nWALENCKI (in Russian; subtitles) You again! \nZUS \nNOW! \nWALENCKI Sure, sure. Take what you want... Tuvia begins to stuff provisions into a sack. \nZUS Where is your gun, farmer? \nWALENCKI I have no gun. Zus grabs a dinner plate and SMASHES IT IN THE FARMER'S \nFACE. \nZUS \nWHERE IS YOUR GUN? Holding his bloody face, the farmer cowers in fear. \n(CONTINUED) \nGOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 8. \n16 CONTINUED: 16 \nWALENCKI Please... Zus kicks him. \nWALENCKI (CONT'D) I beg you... \nTUVIA \nZUS-- \nZUS He's lying. He kicks him again. The farmer begins to weep. \nZUS (CONT'D) You're lying! Zus dumps the remains of the farmer's dinner onto him. \nZUS (CONT'D) If I hit you once more, you will shit your pants. Twice and you will never shit again. The farmer knows Zus won't hesitate. \nWALENCKI Up there... Zus kicks the man aside. Above the stove is an old rifle. Zus grabs it, points it at the farmer. \nZUS We were never here. \nCUT TO: \n17 THE BROTHERS 17 running through the woods. Zus raises the rifle in triumph. \nTUVIA He was willing to help us. \nZUS He's lucky I didn't crush his head. \n(MORE) \nKOSCIK I have only four bullets. \n(CONTINUED) \nBLUE Revision - 6-26-07 12. \n20 CONTINUED: 20 \nTUVIA I cannot thank you enough. They sit in Koscik's warmly-lit kitchen. Koscik's WIFE stands silently by the stove, glaring at Tuvia. \nKOSCIK Your father was a good man. \nTUVIA He said the same of you. Tuvia can't help but notice Koscik's wife giving him the evil eye. Koscik produces a bottle of vodka. \nKOSCIK Ignore the bitch. (raising the bottle) To the dead. God rest their souls. (in Russian; subtitles) Bitch-- Do you want vodka? His wife just glares at him. \nKOSCIK (CONT'D) I live with this, can you imagine? HEADLIGHTS sweep over the window. A CAR is fast approaching. \nKOSCIK (CONT'D) Hide yourself. ...The barn. \n21 TUVIA HURRIES ACROSS THE COURTYARD AND INTO THE BARN. 21 \n22 IN THE LOFT 22 He climbs a ladder and is startled to find FIVE MORE MEN AND WOMEN in hiding. They stare in mute terror. \n23 OUTSIDE THE BARN 23 Koscik greets A BELARUSSIAN POLICE CAPTAIN and his SONS as they exit the car. They speak in Russian, with subtitles: \nKOSCIK Working late, boys. \nPOLICE CAPTAIN Hunting Jews. Our new bosses are very organized. Koscik offers the bottle. \nKOSCIK Hunting can work up a thirst. \n(CONTINUED) \nSALMON Revision - 8-19-07 13. \n23 CONTINUED: 23 \nPOLICE CAPTAIN Fifteen in one day. The council is offering a year's free tax for every one you turn in. - \nKOSCIK A Jew is worth that much? Do you pay more for a fat one? They laugh appreciatively. \n24 IN THE LOFT 24 A man COUGHS then shrugs an apology. Tuvia glares at him. \n25 BACK TO THE COURTYARD 25 \nPOLICE CAPTAIN Caught five of them hiding in a ditch. Smelled so bad I was afraid the Germans wouldn't want them. \nKOSCIK Maybe for a reduced price. More laughter. More vodka. \nPOLICE CAPTAIN You know the Bielski's? \nKOSCIK Sure. \nPOLICE CAPTAIN We missed two when we visited the parents. \n26 IN THE LOFT 26 Tuvia listens to this casual talk of his parent's death. \n27 BACK IN THE COURTYARD 27 \nPOLICE CAPTAIN Anybody caught helping them is in for it. You know this, Koscik? \nKOSCIK Do I look like an idiot? Don't answer so quickly... More laughter. The Police Captain looks at his watch. Yawns. \n(CONTINUED) \nGOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 14. \n27 CONTINUED: 27 \nPOLICE CAPTAIN Been at it since dawn. The wife doesn't like these long nights. He tries to hand back the bottle to Koscik. \nKOSCIK Keep it. \nPOLICE CAPTAIN Bribing an officer of the law? Maybe you have more of this black market vodka hidden in the barn? \nKOSCIK Take a look. And clean out the cow shit while you're back there. The policeman laughs and climbs back into the car. \nPOLICE CAPTAIN You'll keep your eyes open, yes? \nKOSCIK Good hunting. \n28 MOMENTS LATER - IN THE BARN 28 Koscik and Tuvia speak in harsh whispers. \nKOSCIK --If the laborers find them tomorrow, I will be denounced-- \nTUVIA What am I supposed to do with-- \nKOSCIK Take them into the forest-- \n34 INSIDE THE HOUSE 34 The POLICE CAPTAIN we saw earlier eats dinner with his WIFE and TWO SONS. They speak in Russian. \nWIFE You worked late. The man nods, his mouth full of food. \nWIFE (CONT'D) Tomorrow is Sunday. You have a day off, yes? \nPOLICE CAPTAIN (still chewing; nods) ...Fucking SS never sleeps... The door OPENS slowly. They all look up. \n(CONTINUED) \nYELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 18. \n34 CONTINUED: 34 Tuvia stands on the threshold, dripping wet, a spectral figure. He holds the pistol at his side. \nTUVIA You know who I am? The policeman says nothing. His wife is instantly terrified. One of the SONS stands. Tuvia turns the gun on him. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) Sit. The son obeys. The SOUND of the rain on the tin roof is deafening. Tuvia turns back to the Police Captain. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) And you know why I am here. \nPOLICE CAPTAIN ...what are you talking about? \nTUVIA You have no idea what I'm talking about... \nPOLICE CAPTAIN If they say find someone, I find him. It's my job. \nTUVIA To find Jews. \nPOLICE CAPTAIN Or lose my job. \nTUVIA And it's a good job, isn't it? You like your job. \nPOLICEMAN I was always fair with your family. ...Everyone knew you were smuggling this and that. But I looked the other way. (in desperation) ...Ask your father. \nTUVIA My father? You don't talk about my father... Tuvia places the pistol against the man's forehead. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) Down on your knees. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 19. \n34 CONTINUED: (2) 34 \nTUVIA (CONT'D) \n(BELLOWING) \nON...YOUR...KNEES...PIG! The policeman begins to weep. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) For my parents, David and Beila Bielski... for my brothers and all the others-- \nPOLICE CAPTAIN Please.... I beg you... One of the man's SONS makes a move toward Tuvia. Tuvia SHOOTS him in the chest. His mother SCREAMS. The Policeman suddenly starts to stand. Tuvia backs away, shoots him. And then the other son. It is all over in seconds. \n35 OMITTED 35 \n36 TUVIA STANDS THERE, FROZEN 36 The police captain's wife is prostrate and KEENING over her dead family in Russian. \nWIFE Kill me, too! Tuvia should indeed kill her, too. To avoid being identified. \nTUVIA Tell them who did this. \nCUT TO: \n36A EXT. POLICE CAPTAIN'S HOUSE - DUSK 36A \nThe rain still pours down on the house as Tuvia runs away. \n37 A FOREST TRAIL - STILL RAINING 37 Tuvia pushes through dense forest. Branches rake his face. Finally he leans against a tree. We move CLOSE on his face. \nTUVIA Riboynoy shel oylam, riboynoy shel oylam... (closes his eyes) Lord of the universe, forgive me, I have murdered -- but they were monsters and did not deserve to live. \nDOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 20. \n38 NEXT MORNING - A LOW FOG CLINGS TO THE FOREST FLOOR 38 Zus awakens, sodden and stiff. He looks at the group, now numbering fourteen. People sleep huddled together: Asael holds Aron; Avram keeps his surviving daughter close. And there is Tuvia -- sitting by the fire. Zus takes the pistol from Tuvia's belt. Checks the cylinder. \nZUS Only one bullet left. \nTUVIA His sons. Zus nods his approval. \nZUS How was it? \nTUVIA What? \nZUS To kill them. It was good, no? \nTUVIA Shut up. Tuvia stares into the fire. He is dirty and tired. Zus looks around. \nTUVIA As long as his village wife stays in hiding. \nMALBIN Nice to know there are some things even Hitler can't destroy. \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 23. \n40A CONTINUED: 40A Suddenly the camp grows quiet. TWO YOUNG MEN who have emerged from the forest, their clothes dirty and torn. One of them aims an army-issue rifle. \nZUS Hello, boys, what can we do for you? \nYOUNG MAN #1 Food. We want food. Everyone remains still. Zus eyes his own rifle nearby. \nZUS These little shits are holding us up. The Young Man motions his partner to take Zus's rifle. \nZUS (CONT'D) You little shits have the balls to shoot me? In response, the young man CHAMBERS A ROUND. \nTUVIA This is all the food we have. You are welcome to share. \nZUS No. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nYELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 23A. \n40A CONTINUED: (2) 40A \nZUS (CONT'D) I want to see if this little shit will shoot me. You like shooting Jews, you little shit? \nYOUNG MAN #1 You are Jews? \n(CONTINUED) \nGREEN Revision - 8-8-07 24. \n40A CONTINUED: (3) 40A \nZUS No. We're the Gestapo, you little shit. \nTUVIA Come. Sit. Put down your guns. \nZUS Or perhaps you'd prefer I shove them up your ass. \nTUVIA Where are you from? The young man glares at Zus. Then, to Tuvia: \nYOUNG MAN #1 Horodyszcze. The name freezes Zus in his tracks. His wife is there. \nPERETZ We haven't eaten in two days. My name is Peretz, this is Jacov. \nJACOV Two days ago there were three thousand Jews in Horodyszcze. Now there are fifty. Me and him, we hid in a wall. \nZUS You know a woman there, Sonia Bielski? The men look at one another. \nJACOV We knew her. Zus can hardly bring himself to ask the next question. \nZUS ...There was a child. Jacov shakes his head. Sorry. Zus leans his head against a tree. After a moment he begins to BEAT HIS HEAD against it until BLOOD pours down his face. \nASAEL (to the newcomers) His family. Tuvia puts his arms around his brother. Zus's shoulders begin to heave. Soon his body convulses with deep wracking sobs. He is absolutely unself-conscious in his grief. \n(CONTINUED) \nGREEN Revision - 8-8-07 25. \n40A CONTINUED: (4) 40A \nZUS So many dead. \nTUVIA I know. \nZUS Mama. Papa. Their heads are close together, their faces wet with tears. \nZUS (CONT'D) Why not us? \nTUVIA I don't know. \nZUS I thought they'd be safe. I should have been with them. \nTUVIA No. \nZUS I could have protected them. Tuvia just holds him. He, too, is crying quietly. \nZUS (CONT'D) Better to be rabbits? Hunted? Hiding? No... Zus breaks free of Tuvia's embrace and walks away. \n41 LATER - BY THE FIRE 41 Jacov and Peretz are eating. Between ravenous bites-- \nPERETZ We are looking for partisans. \nZUS (CONT'D) \nWE ARE THE BIELSKI OTRIAD! WE ARE \nJEWS! YOU LIKE TO KILL JEWS! HERE \nWE ARE! WE ARE THE BIELSKI'S! \nTELL THEM! Tuvia looks around warily. This is getting out of hand. \nCUT TO: \n44 A ROADSIDE DITCH - LATER THAT NIGHT 44 Tuvia and Asael lie in on one side of a road. Tuvia has looped ONE END OF THE WIRE around a post. \n45 IN THE DITCH ON THE OTHER SIDE 45 Zus, Peretz, and Jacov WRAP THE WIRE to a tree. \n46 UP AHEAD 46 The lights of a MOTORCYCLE, a GERMAN COURIER. \n47 IN THE DITCH 47 Tuvia waits until the BIKE is almost upon them. Then he TIGHTENS the WIRE so it stretches INVISIBLY ACROSS THE ROAD. \nGOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 29. \n48 THE MOTORCYCLIST IS GARROTED 48 by the wire. His bike goes sliding away as the Bielski's swarm him, KILLING HIM with the last bullet from the Mahkarov. ZUS rummages through the downed-bike's saddlebags. He finds a beautiful KNIFE and lifts it up triumphantly. \nPERETZ Look--! MORE HEADLIGHTS fast approaching. \nTUVIA Hide! Everyone! They all scramble back into the ditch, dragging the dead courier with them. \n49 A GERMAN STAFF CAR 49 approaches. As its headlights pick up the downed motorcycle, it slows and pulls off to the side -- \n50 DIRECTLY OVER THE DITCH 50 Where Tuvia and Zus are concealed. From within the car, we hear VOICES SPEAKING GERMAN. A YOUNG PRIVATE gets out and walks up the road to investigate. \nPRIVATE (in German; subtitled) It's one of ours, but no one is here. Maybe he was drunk? From the car, an SERGEANT yells a reply. \nSERGEANT (in German; subtitled) Move it off the road before the convoy passes. I'll report the sonuvabitch. As the soldier drags the bike off the road, AN OFFICER steps out of the car and lights a cigarette. He's followed by the Sergeant. He carries a Schmeisser SUBMACHINE GUN dangling from his shoulder. \n51 IN THE DITCH - ZUS 51 can see the Sergeant's feet peeking out over the ditch. \nA STREAM OF PISS Cascades onto him. He tries to inch his body away... \n(CONTINUED) \nGOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 30. \n51 CONTINUED: 51 \nTHE PISSING SERGEANT catches the flicker of MOVEMENT below, SEES Zus lying in the ditch. Stunned, he tries to zip up his fly. It catches. ZUS LEAPS UP brandishing the KNIFE. He's on the Sergeant before he can get the gun off his shoulder. Stabbing him through his greatcoat, the BLADE BREAKS OFF IN HIS HAND. MEANWHILE, THE LIEUTENANT drops his cigarette, reaching under his coat for a pistol. Tuvia TACKLES him. The GUN skids away. They roll around on the road, CLAWING, PUNCHING, BITING. Tuvia SLAMS the man's head against the pavement. \n52 UP THE ROAD 52 The Private sees Asael and Peretz coming at him. Jacov follows with his rifle. The Private turns and runs down the road. They give chase. \n53 FROM INSIDE THE CAR 53 Another OFFICER is in the back seat with A WOMAN. He reaches for his gun, stands up in the seat and begins FIRING WILDLY at Tuvia. TUVIA ROLLS UNDER THE CAR, avoiding the burst. MEANWHILE, ZUS USES THE HANDLE OF THE KNIFE to BREAK the Sergeant's nose. He RIPS the SCHMEISSER away, firing point- blank into the man, whose greatcoat CATCHES FIRE. \nINSIDE THE STAFF CAR The officer takes close aim at Tuvia, just as ZUS TURNS THE MACHINE GUN on the car BLOWING OUT THE WINDOWS, killing the Officer and the woman -- and saving his brother's life. \n54 MEANWHILE, DOWN THE ROAD 54 Jacov fires at the Private, MISSES. The man keeps RUNNING. Jacov fires again. MISSES AGAIN. FINALLY his THIRD SHOT hits him in the leg. The Private keeps running. Limping now. \nJACOV I got him! Peretz and Asael can now catch up to the soldier. \nFROM FAR AWAY We SEE them knock the Private to the ground, KICKING him until Jacov catches up to them and FIRES A FINAL SHOT. \nGREEN Revision - 8-8-07 31. \n55 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 55 Tuvia stands, out of breath. \nTUVIA Stupid! The gunfire could be heard for miles. \nZUS He was pissing on my head. Zus is high from the killing, covered in the dead man's blood. He begins calling out orders. \nZUS (CONT'D) Peretz, Jacov, check the car for guns... (to Tuvia) This one's yours. He presents him with the Schmeisser as if it were a trophy. Tuvia accepts it, checking the gun efficiently. \nZUS (CONT'D) I'll check his pockets for more ammo. \nTUVIA Hurry--! \nAT THE STAFF CAR Peretz and Jacov emerge with two MACHINE-PISTOLS, several BOTTLES OF SCHNAPPS and a beautiful LEICA CAMERA. \nJACOV They were on their way to a party! They toss one bottle to Zus and another to Tuvia. \n56 UP THE ROAD 56 Asael stands over the dead Private. He isn't much older than Aron. \n57 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 57 ZUS rifles the pockets of the dead Sergeant for ammo. He finds cigarettes and the man's wallet. He opens it. \nZUS Welcome to Belarus, herr Henkel. A CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS as Peretz and Jacov toast their victory. \nPERETZ Now we are real Partisans... \n(CONTINUED) \nGOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 32. \nMIRIAM Pardon me, you are from Vilna. My sister lives on Passaya Street. \nBEN ZION The SD came without warning. Hundreds were taken. No one knows where. \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 36. \n63 CONTINUED: 63 THE WOMAN begins to cry. \nMIRIAM My poor sister...dear God, no... Meanwhile, Peretz's MOANING ceases. A woman grumbles: \nWOMAN #1 We'd be better off in the ghetto... \nTAMARA At least here we are safe. \nLOVA There at least we had hope... \nSHIMON No. Here, we have hope. A FEW MORE join in, grumbling their dissatisfaction. Others take the opposite position. These are Jews, after all, and arguing is a revered sport and a pastime. It escalates. \nWOMAN #1 We are hungry! This is a defining moment for Tuvia. When at first he speaks, it is awkward, ineffectual amid the growing tumult. \nTUVIA I know we have no food. But tomorrow... tomorrow will be another mission. \nRONA Look what happened the last time. \nTUVIA That was a mistake! But the mistakes we made will not be made again! More objections. Tuvia must raise his voice to be heard. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) We could be here a long time. And we have to prepare. \nLOVA How? \nTUVIA Better security. Better at getting food and information-- (talking over their \nOBJECTIONS) --at making shelters. Whatever is needed. We all participate. We don't work against each other. At this he looks directly at Zus. Daring him to object. \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 36A. \n63 CONTINUED: (2) 63 \nTUVIA (CONT'D) I want to kill Nazis, too, but we...just...cannot afford revenge. Not right now. We cannot afford to lose friends like Jacov and Peretz. A small voice speaks up. \nARON Or Asael. Everyone stares. It is the first time Aron has spoken. \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 37. \n63 CONTINUED: (3) 63 \nTUVIA Or Asael. We... We-- (trying to hold it \nTOGETHER) --cannot lose anyone. He looks from face to face. Filthy, ravaged, many of them with tears in their eyes. This is what they need -- leadership, faith, something to believe in. And gradually, his tentativeness and awkwardness is replaced by something else. A new voice. From deep inside. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) ...We will map out where we've been so as to not visit the same farms too often. And we take only from those who can afford to give, and leave those who can't alone. \nLOVA The poorest farmer has more than us. \nTUVIA True. But what I am saying is... what I mean is... We are not thieves. (his resolve growing with every word) Or murderers. We may be hunted like animals but we will not become animals. (looks at them all) We have all chosen this -- to live free, like human beings, for as long as we can. Each day of freedom is an act of faith. And if we die trying to live, at least we die like human beings. His mission statement. A vision of their future. Everyone nods in mute acknowledgement. Zus lowers his head. The shift in power between them has occurred. Tuvia has emerged as the undisputed leader. \nCUT TO: \n64 OMITTED 64 \n64A FALL IN THE FOREST 64A The trees take on color as if in celebration of their coming together. \n65 KOSCIK'S FARM 65 All is quiet as Tuvia, Zus and Ben Zion watch from the woods. \n(CONTINUED) \nSALMON Revision - 8-19-07 38. \n65 CONTINUED: 65 \nTUVIA Now. They leave their cover and approach warily, guns at the ready. \n66 OUTSIDE THE HOUSE 66 Koscik's wife looks up from her garden and glares at them. \nTUVIA Hello. She refuses to be flattered. In Russian: \nKOSCIK'S WIFE In the barn. \n67 IN THE BARN 67 Zus calls out. \nZUS Koscik, put your pants back on and leave those sheep alone. He steps into the shadows to find: \nKOSCIK HANGING FROM A THRESHING HOOK that has been driven through his chest. A sign attached to the hook reads (in Polish) \"JEW LOVER.\" \nTUVIA What's her name? \nASAEL Chaya. [I believe.] \nTUVIA \n(YELLING) \nCHAYA! He waves as Chaya turns to look in their direction. Asael smiles, embarrassed. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) So talk to her. \nASAEL I hardly know her. \nTUVIA You spent three days in a cellar! Asael blushes, returns the focus to their prior conversation. \nASAEL Malbin says the Piznarksi granary is full. We need two guns at least... \nTUVIA Whose turn to go? \nASAEL Zus. \nTUVIA You go along, just to make sure he understands my orders. Asael nods. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) (re: Chaya) Go on...Go! \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 A41-41A. \n73 CONTINUED: 73 Asael heads toward Chaya. \n74 NEAR A SHED ROOF - BEN ZION 74 We notice a FEW NEW FACES. Their number has exceeded twenty. Among them are two lumbering, dark-skinned men, ARKADY and MOTL LUBCZANSKI. Ben Zion is showing Lazar and the other newcomers how to clean a weapon. \nBEN ZION This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword. You fix the patch to the rod-- They do as he instructs. \nBEN ZION (CONT'D) --then run it through the barrel... and don't lose the patch in the \nBARREL-- Lazar looks up, sheepishly. \nLAZAR I lost my patch. ARKADY LUBCZANSKI whispers contemptuously to his brother, \nMOTL... \nARKADY LUBCZANSKI The village idiot. Zus shoves Arkady out of the way and approaches Lazar, who cowers. But rather than abuse him, Zus removes the patch from the rifle and hands it back to him. \nLAZAR Thank you, Zus. \nZUS (returning the rifle) It's nothing. \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 42. \n75 OMITTED 75 \n76 A ROADSIDE - NEXT DAY 76 KISSELY is a MILKMAN with bright red hair and a bushy mustache. He leads a horse-drawn CART laden with milk cans. ZUS AND THE OTHERS rise up out of the ditch. In Russian: \nZUS (a pleasant tone) Good morning, friend. Getting an early start to market? Could you possibly spare us a bit of milk? Zus' tone is belied by the rifle in his hand. \nKISSELY This is what I'm required to give the Germans. If I don't meet my quota they'll shoot me and my family. Zus is tempted to shoot him himself. \nASAEL (to Zus) Leave half. He can't go to the Germans empty-handed. Zus glares at Asael. \nASAEL (CONT'D) Tuvia's orders. Zus shakes his head, climbs onto the wagon and begins removing cartons. \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 43. \n76 CONTINUED: 76 \nZUS (to the milkman) We are so grateful, comrade, for your cooperation. What a lovely coat. Is that a fur collar? \nCUT TO: \n77 ZUS, NOW WEARING THE MILKMAN'S COAT 77 joins the others lugging milk cans along the forest path. \nLAZAR (V.O.) \nHALT! WHO GOES THERE! Zus shakes his head. Lazar stands, pointing his weapon. \nZUS Lazar, you can see it's us, you idiot. You only ask, 'who goes there' when you don't know who it is. \nLAZAR Sorry, Zus. \n78 THE CAMP 78 is a beehive of activity. Shimon and Malbin are digging. \nMALBIN Even Spinoza said existence can be substantiated by empirical evidence. \nARON If we had some dynamite we could blow the shit out of it. \nRACHEL (with undisguised \nAWE) ...Just like your brothers. Aron can't help but be pleased by this notion. Then, as the train passes, they can see HANDS gripping the small barred windows. And every now and then a gaunt, desperate FACE. They stare in astonishment. \nCUT TO: \n81 OMITTED 81 \nSALMON Revision - 8-19-07 47. \n81A UNDER A SHELTER -- CONTINUOUS 81A Tuvia sits alone. Outside, the SOUND of the violin continues. Shimon comes to sit beside him. \nSHIMON I am sorry for your loss. Tuvia nods. He is deep inside himself. \nSHIMON (CONT'D) Do you want to say the Kaddish? When at last Tuvia speaks, it is almost to himself. \nTUVIA She was a beautiful woman. But cold. Not a day went by she didn't remind me I wasn't a good provider. For years it wasn't really a marriage at all. And now... He lowers his head. All Shimon can do is sit beside him. \n82 THE PERIMETER OF THE CAMP - CONTINUOUS 82 Bella takes Chaya aside. \nBELLA You have lipstick? Please, I know you have some left. Chaya digs in her pocket and produces a tiny remnant. Bella dabs it on and casually approaches Zus, who is on guard duty. \nBELLA (O.S.) (CONT'D) May I join you? \nZUS Of course. \nBELLA You get lonely out here? \nZUS I like the woods. LAUGHTER and MUSIC waft through the trees. \nBELLA I'm a little scared out here. Zus knows an opportunity when he sees one. He offers her a drink from his bottle of vodka. \n(CONTINUED) \nGOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 48. \n82 CONTINUED: 82 \nBELLA (CONT'D) I've never tried it. \nZUS Go ahead. She drinks, refuses to grimace. Drinks again. Zus laughs. - Bella touches the rifle in his arms. \nBELLA Why is there a rule against women having guns? \nZUS There aren't enough for the men. \nBELLA Women need guns, too. \nZUS What for? \nBELLA For protection. \nZUS Women have men for protection. Bella bites her lip. She's a virgin but also realistic. \nBELLA I want protection. She steps closer and takes Zus's hand...under her coat...onto her breast...never taking her eyes off him. \nBELLA (CONT'D) You will take good care of me? You will be my commander. \n83 OMITTED 83 \n84 MEANWHILE - DEEP IN THE FOREST 84 Aron and Rachel are walking back from the train tracks. Suddenly he senses movement, freezes: ARMED POLICEMEN are advancing through the trees. Aron and Rachel bury themselves beneath piles of leaves until the police pass by, then he grabs her hand and dashes \nOFF-- ARON RUNS through the woods like a deer. She follows. \nDOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 49. \n85 IN THE CAMP 85 He bursts in, SCREAMING. \nARON \nMEN WITH GUNS! Chaos. People panic, search for family members, grab whatever they can carry, ZUS AND BELLA emerge from the woods where they have lain together for the first time. He grabs his rifle. TUVIA tries to maintain order. \nTUVIA \nONLY FOOD AND GUNS! FOLLOW ASAEL! Asael clutches Chaya's hand. Rounding up others. \nASAEL Don't panic. THIS WAY!. GO. \nZUS \nQUIET! NOT ANOTHER WORD!!! THE POLICEMEN begin FIRING. TWO of the group are KILLED. Tuvia roughly pushes people deeper into the woods. \nTUVIA Lova, Ben Zion -- stay with us. Asael, keep them moving. Don't stop! THE POLICEMEN enter the camp. A submachine gun RAKES a shelter. KISSELY has found the escape trail into the woods. \nKISSELY This way-- \n86 THE FOREST IS DEATHLY STILL 86 Tuvia and Zus usher the group across the river and up the embankment. \n88 THE NOVEMBER WIND WHISTLES THROUGH THE BARE FOREST (MONTAGE) 88 as the group trudges along -- weighed down by cooking gear, food, guns, etc. Asael takes the iron cauldron from Chaya. Zus and Bella walk side-by-side. Pinchas leads his goat. \nMALBIN Where is he taking us? My feet are going to fall off. \nSHIMON A great rabbi once said, \"wherever I go, I am always going to the land of Israel.\" \nMALBIN Well, maybe rabbis should give better directions. Tuvia walks alongside but apart. \nCUT TO: \n89 A HILLSIDE 89 The group is sprawled on the ground. Four people share a single cigarette. Shimon and Malbin hardly have the energy to argue. Pinchas feeds his goat. Tuvia walks among them. \nTUVIA Rest and eat. I need volunteers for a scouting party. Zus raises his hand. Tuvia nods in grudging gratitude. However mixed his feelings, Zus can always be counted on. \nCUT TO: \n90 A FORK IN THE TRAIL 90 Tuvia looks at Zus, who shrugs. They are in unfamiliar territory. As they move cautiously forward: \nA MAN IN A RED ARMY TUNIC steps into the path, holding an automatic rifle. He WHISTLES softly. More ARMED MEN materialize, surrounding them. \nGRAMOV (in Russian; subtitles) \nWHO ARE YOU? Tuvia instantly grasps the situation. He salutes. \nTUVIA (in Russian; subtitles) A brigade of independent fighters searching for our comrades. \n(CONTINUED) \nCHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 52A. \n90 CONTINUED: 90 Zus almost does a double-take at Tuvia's bluff. \nGRAMOV What brigade? \n(CONTINUED) \nYELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 53. \n90 CONTINUED: (2) 90 \nTUVIA We belong to the Bielski otriad. \nGRAMOV We know of you. Jewish bandits. Zus's finger tightens on the trigger of his submachine gun. \nZUS I'll take the two on the left... Tuvia maintains his composure. \nTUVIA I'm sure we can clear up this misunderstanding with your commander. \nCUT TO: \n91 THE OCTOBER OTRIAD BASE 91 A primitive tent camp. RUSSIAN PARTISANS move about, quiet and cold-eyed men wearing remnants of Red Army uniforms. Zus can't help but be impressed by the array of weaponry. VICTOR PACHENKO emerges from a tent. A former lieutenant, dashing in a fur cap and long officer's coat. He addresses them in Russian. \nVIKTOR I am Viktor Panchenko, commander of the October otriad. We have had complaints of a Jewish gang stealing from villages loyal to us. (a steely look) How do you respond to these charges? \nTUVIA When you take food it is from loyal supporters. When we do, you call it stealing. \nVIKTOR We are soldiers. \nTUVIA And we fight a common enemy. The motherland doesn't distinguish between Jews and non-Jews. Viktor is amused by this bit of Soviet dogma. \nVIKTOR But Jews do not fight. \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 54. \n91 CONTINUED: 91 \nTUVIA These Jews do. Viktor appraises Tuvia for a moment. \nVIKTOR We will see. Select your best fighters and send them to us. Zus looks at Tuvia, knowing he has no choice. \nTUVIA We are honored to be of service. Tuvia and Zus SALUTE and head back the way they came. \nZUS (under his breath) So we're partisans now. \nTUVIA As if we have a choice. \nCUT TO: \n91A NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 91A Has taken root. People hard at work building zemylanka. \n92 THE NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 92 Tuvia and Malbin are working together on a new bunker. Malbin expertly nails a header across a doorway. \nTUVIA (throwing a smaller \nHAMMER) Here. \nMALBIN If my friends at The New Socialists' Club could see me now... (shakes his head) I haven't read a book in months. \nTUVIA No. I'll bring them out myself. \nZUS From the ghetto. \nTUVIA Yes. \nZUS Pan Tuvia. Rabbi Tuvia. Allow me to kiss your hand... Tuvia tries to pull his hand away, but Zus holds him. \nZUS (CONT'D) You think Pachenko wants hundreds more of us in the forest? \nTUVIA I cannot have you contradicting me... Not when others are around. (looks around) Our family must stick together. \n(CONTINUED) \nTAN Revision - 9-10-07 58. \n94 CONTINUED: (2) 94 \nZUS And who is it that's risking our family, and for what? For the sake of these-- (gestures at the new \nARRIVALS) --Malbushim. \nTUVIA Don't call them that. \nZUS That's who comes to us from the ghetto. Empty clothes. Bloodsuckers. \nTUVIA They are people. Jews. \nZUS Pretentious Jews. Jews who stuck up their noses and wouldn't give us the time of day when we passed them on the street. Jews who went out of their way to keep their daughters locked away from our dirty hands. \n(SAVAGELY) You think your old teacher will give you a good grade because you saved his worthless ass! They accept you as their leader only because they are too weak and full of shit to help themselves. \nTUVIA --What about Bella? Tuvia looks over at Bella, who is anxiously watching. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) --You think she'd be with you if it wasn't for what is happening here? Zus glares at him, but tries to control himself. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) --Is it love Zus? \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 59. \n94 CONTINUED: (3) 94 Zus is sick of talk. He PUNCHES Tuvia in the face. Tuvia is rocked but still he goads his brother. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) You are the man of her dreams? The Romeo of Novagrudok? Zus can't take anymore. He charges Tuvia, who sidesteps and SLAMS him in the gut. All the frustration of the past months, not to mention years of sibling rivalry, translates into fists and elbows. Ben Zion moves to break it up. Tuvia and Zus turn on him. \nZUS Is this your business? Zus gains the upper hand and starts to beat the crap put of Tuvia. Finally, in desperation Tuvia rolls away and picks up a rock. He is about to slam it into his brother's head when suddenly he stops himself. The two brothers look at each other, both breathing heavily -- realizing that they have crossed some line. \nZUS (CONT'D) (calls out) Ben Zion. Krensky. Lova. Israel. Let's go. (to Tuvia) We are going to join the real partisans. He looks at Asael. \nZUS (CONT'D) Are you coming? Asael looks at one brother, then the other. Once again, he is in the middle. He looks at Chaya, then back at Zus. \nASAEL No. \nZUS Good. I'll dance at your wedding. He stops by Bella's side, touches her arm, then disappears down the trail. The others follow. \nCUT TO: \n95 THE OUTSKIRTS OF NOVOGRUDOK 95 Tuvia and Asael feel naked outside the safety of the forest. In the distance the city looms. \n95A THE STREETS OF NOVOGRUDOK 95A Tuvia and Asael pass by the barbed wire and machine-guns of the guards and dogs manning the barrier to the ghetto. \nGOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 59A. \n96 THE WALLS OF THE NOVOGRUDOK GHETTO 96 Tuvia and Asael climb over a dilapidated wall. \nDOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 60. \n97 THE DESERTED STREETS OF THE GHETTO 97 People peer out from behind shuttered windows. Others hurry to get off the street. Tuvia consults a hand-drawn map. \nTUVIA This way. \n98 OMITTED 98 \n98A EXT. FOREST - DAY 98A \nZus, Lova and Ben Zion march alongside the Russians Partisans. \nDOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 61. \n99 AN APARTMENT IN THE GHETTO - DAY 99 that might once have been home to a family-of-four now HOUSES fifteen. Tuvia and Asael are deep in conversation with several ELDERS of the ghetto Council \nELDER #1 We are not so naive as to believe they won't kill some of us. But all the Jews? It makes no sense. They need us to work. In the factories. The labor camps. Tuvia notices A PRETTY GIRL standing on a chair in order to hear. Her name is LILKA and we will soon come to know her. \n(CONTINUED) \nYELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 62. \n99 CONTINUED: 99 \nZUS --So we attack the transmitter. \nVIKTOR Yes, yes, my Hebrew warrior. Except for the troops in Stankiewcze and the machine guns out front. THE TENT FLAP OPENS. Tuvia enters. He has developed a cough. \nVIKTOR (CONT'D) Two Bielski's in one room! To what do we owe this honor? \nTUVIA We have sickness. I need ampicillin. \nVIKTOR This medicine is reserved for fighters. \nTUVIA If typhus breaks out in our camp, it may spread to yours. \nVIKTOR I will have to take that chance. Zus looks from one immovable force to the other. \nTUVIA I must insist. Comrade. \nVIKTOR You'd better not. Zus is watching this dick-measuring with keen interest. \nZUS There would be medicine in the police headquarters at Stankiewcze, yes? \n(CONTINUED) \nBLUE Revision - 6-26-07 76. \n114 CONTINUED: 114 He looks to Gramov, who looks to Viktor, who nods. \nZUS (CONT'D) Tuvia and I grew up there. (looks at Tuvia) Perhaps the Bielski otriad will volunteer to take out the transmitter. Viktor looks from Zus to Tuvia. \nTUVIA Of course. Zus grabs his submachine gun. \nZUS Krensky, Ben Zion. Let's go. \nCUT TO: \n115 THE TOWN OF STAKIEWICZE 115 is quiet at midnight on this snowy evening. \n116 IN A BACK ALLEY 116 Tuvia and Zus sit in the cab of an old truck, its exhaust sending plumes of condensation into the freezing night. \nZUS Well... He looks into the back where the others wait, anxiously clutching their weapons. Tuvia tries to hold back a cough. \nZUS (CONT'D) Stay with the truck. And make sure it's in gear when we get back. \nTUVIA I'm going in with you. \nZUS I give the orders tonight. Across the square, the police station looms. \nTUVIA You don't have to do this. \nZUS I don't? (a bitter laugh) What about the typhus? \n(CONTINUED) \nPINK Revision - 7-18-07 77. \n116 CONTINUED: 116 \nTUVIA So more die. They will anyway. A grim smile from Zus. Tuvia is broken up inside. \nZUS I have been given this mission by my superior officer. He starts to get out the cab. Tuvia reaches into his pocket, takes out the mezuzah that once blessed their parents' home. \nTUVIA Zus... (hands him the mezuzah) For luck. Zuz pockets it and joins the others creeping into the shadows. But rather than follow them into the police station, we HOLD on Tuvia's face. Suddenly we HEAR The sound of gunfire. Then nothing. Ten seconds. More gunfire. Twenty. It is excruciating. Thirty. The longest CLOSE-UP in film history. \n117 INTERCUT - FLASHES OF WHAT IS HAPPENING INSIDE... 117 Ben Zion bursts in and opens fire, killing two policemen. Krensky jumps the counter and smashes the transmitter. A policeman appears behind them on the stairs and shoots Krensky in the back. Ben Zion whirls and kills him. \n117A TUVIA WANTS TO HELP. HE PULLS HIS GUN, UNLOCKS THE DOOR. 117A \nOPENS IT. STOPS. HE HAS PROMISED TO WAIT WITH THE TRUCK. Zus, meanwhile, rummages cabinets, looking for ampicillin. \nBEN ZION Let's GO! In the back room, Zus keeps rummaging. A window EXPLODES. Ben Zion is hit. Mortally wounded, he sinks to his knees, returning fire as Zus reappears. \n118 TUVIA WATCHES 118 as Zus bursts out the door. He races to the truck and struggles into the passenger seat, BLEEDING FROM HIS \nSHOULDER. \nZUS Go. GO! \nTUVIA What about the others?! \n(CONTINUED) \nPINK Revision - 7-18-07 77A. \n118 CONTINUED: 118 \nZUS \nGO, DAMN YOU! \n119 IN THE TRUCK (TRAVELING) 119 From his coat Zus takes out a BLOOD-SOAKED PACKAGE. \n122 CONTINUED: (2) 122 \nASAEL ...that you drink too much and are no longer fit to lead us. \nTUVIA .Maybe they're right. Asael looks at him. No longer the brother he once idealized. \nASAEL Zus would have punched him senseless. \nTUVIA Zus. \nASAEL I miss him. \n\u00c3\u009f TUVIA He has made his choice. He reels away toward the woods. \nCUT TO: \n122A IN HIS ZEMYLANKA - LATER 122A Tuvia is lying in his bunker, vomiting and burning up with fever. Shimon has brought him soup. \nSHIMON Drink this. \n(WINKS) From the bottom of the pot. Tuvia can barely get the soup down. \nTUVIA ...the way they look at me... with their pasty faces. Let them starve, we're all going to die out here anyway. \nSHIMON Not easy being the big boss. Moses was a lonely man when he led us out of bondage. \nTUVIA ...Moses. \nSHIMON So I'm a sucker for a biblical allusion. But what is society without leaders. Without leaders, we falter. \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 81A. \n122A CONTINUED: 122A \nTUVIA I am not a leader. \nSHIMON Neither was Moses, but somehow that seemed to work out. \nCUT TO: \n123 THE PARTISAN CAMP 123 Several partisans are singing a drinking song while Zus silently soaks his feet in a bucket. Lova walks in. His face is black and blue. \nZUS Lova, what happened? Who did this? Lova sits and buries his head in his hands. \nZUS (CONT'D) Lova. Tell me. Who? \nLOVA Gramov. Two others. I used the officer's latrine. \nZUS For this they beat you? Lova is trying not to weep. \nLOVA They said they wouldn't shit in the same hole as a Jew. Zus gets to his feet. \nCUT TO: \n123A INT. PANCHENKO'S TENT -- MOMENTS LATER 123A \nZus bursts in to find Panchenko deep in conversation with Gramov and others. They look up at the intrusion. \nZUS Forgive me, Commander. \nPANCHENKO Zus. Join us. He offers him a glass of vodka. Zus doesn't take it. \nZUS I want to report the mistreatment of a comrade. Gramov looks up. Zus meets his eye. \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 81B. \n123A CONTINUED: 123A \nZUS (CONT'D) This man beat Comrade Lova -- for no reason at all. \nGRAMOV I had a perfectly good reason. He is a Jew. The other men LAUGH. Panchenko frowns at Gramov. \nPANCHENKO --and you are an ignorant Tartar. (offers Zus vodka) Ignore him. Here... \nZUS Anti-semitism is a violation of Party discipline. Panchenko sighs. Does he really have to deal with this? \nPANCHENKO He's right, Gramov. Apologize to the Jew. \nGRAMOV I apologize, Jew. \nPANCHENKO There. You see? (...a command) Now drink up. Zus doesn't know what to do. He accepts the vodka. \n124 EXT. THE BIELSKI CAMP (TO ESTABLISH) 124 \nGuards ring the snowy perimeter. \n127 CONTINUED: (2) 127 Whereas once he was greeted warmly by all, now his isolation is complete. He is the Commander. \nDOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 86. \n127A TUVIA CAREENS THROUGH THE TREES 127A Tripping over roots, and finally leaning against a tree, he is mumbling, almost incoherent -- part prayer, part profanity. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n128 OMITTED 128 \n129 THE FIRST BUD OF SPRING 129 struggles through patches of snow. Ice drips from branches. \n130 OMITTED 130 \n130A THE OTRIAD 130A Takes a group portrait. The forest is green again. \n131 THE SUNSHINE IS WARM 131 on the women's bodies as they bathe in the river. \nCHAYA Who has the soap? I know there was a little left? \nBELLA Use the sand. It's good for your skin. \nRIVA And what skin! And already married, too! Bella laughs. Chaya splashes her playfully with water. \nBELLA I've turned into a skeleton. \nCHAYA And you were always so worried about staying slim. \nBELLA When we get out of this forest I am going to eat only cake and grow as big as a house. Tamara appears. She's wearing a long overcoat. \nLILKA Join us. At least the sun is warm. (Tamara turns away; Lilka joins her) Tamara? \nTAMARA I can't, Lilka... (lowers her voice) I'm pregnant. \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 86A. \n131 CONTINUED: 131 \nLILKA I had no idea. \nTAMARA I've kept it hidden for months but now it's obvious. No one can know. They move away from the others. Tamara shows her. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) It could come any day. \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 87. \n131 CONTINUED: (2) 131 \nLILKA ..Who is the father? \nTAMARA I--- It was when I was escaping. A man with a gun stopped me. I thought he was a Partisan. He told me to follow him and he took me to this place... The memory overwhelms her. She begins to break down. \nTAMARA (CONT'D) Inside me something broke....I wanted to die. Every night I have nightmares -- what will happen when Tuvia finds out. \nLILKA He will understand. \nTAMARA No. You mustn't tell him! \nLILKA I won't. Don't worry. (touches her arm) What are you going to do? Tamara's eyes fill with a new resolve. \nTAMARA I feel this new life inside me. It's the only thing keeping me going. I won't give it up, I'll kill myself. Lilka puts her arm around her. \n131A IN THE DEEP FOREST -- ARON IS OUT HUNTING 131A From his belt hang the pelts of two dead rabbits. He hears A SOUND. Three GERMAN SOLDIERS are putting camouflage on their helmets. Beyond, A GERMAN ARMORED COLUMN. The assault is coming. \nCUT TO: \n132 THE CAMP 132 where Shimon and Malbin are playing chess. Shimon has developed a bad cough. \nMALBIN You call that a move? \nSHIMON I call it an inevitable conclusion based on unimpeachable reasoning. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 A87. \n132 CONTINUED: 132 \nSHIMON (CONT'D) The question, my friend the Genius, is what are you going to do about it. \n(CONTINUED) \nCHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 87A. \nASAEL I wouldn't show this around. There are some who'd turn you in for less. \nCUT TO: \n141 LATER - A SPOTTER PLANE BUZZES HIGH ABOVE - HUNTING 141 Down below, Viktor and the Russian partisans have struck their tents and hidden beneath the sheltering trees. Viktor's gaze follows the plane. He gives an order into a field radio. Zus has been listening. \n(CONTINUED) \nSALMON Revision - 8-19-07 95. \n141 CONTINUED: 141 \nZUS You want them to find Tuvia's camp. Viktor just looks at him. \nZUS (CONT'D) You're deliberately sacrificing them so we can remain safe? \nVIKTOR No. So we can keep fighting. Everyone must sacrifice in the struggle. \nZUS Those are my brothers. \nVIKTOR I am your brother! He is your brother! Comrade Zus. Your Jewish sentimentality is heart-warming, but counter-revolutionary. Zus has secretly known he would hear these words. He grips his rifle but holds his tongue. \nBACK TO: \n142 THE SPOTTER PLANE -- FLIES OVER THE BIELSKI CAMP 142 Tuvia stares up at it. Have they been spotted? Shimon is sitting nearby with a group of children. He looks pale. His cough is worse. He is very ill. \nSHIMON ...but the children of Israel were afraid to leave Egypt. Until Moses said, 'Do not trust in me, trust in God.' He will take care of you' (a wrenching cough) And so tomorrow we celebrate the Passover by sitting around and arguing just as we have done for centuries. Tuvia stares at them, a curious expression on his face. Malbin comes to stand beside him. \nMALBIN (looking at the plane) Did it see us? \n(CONTINUED) \nPINK Revision - 7-18-07 96. \n142 CONTINUED: 142 \nTUVIA Tomorrow is Passover. Yes? \nMALBIN ...How should I know? \nTUVIA Moses. The Exodus. Malbin doesn't get it at first. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) --He left before Pharaoh could stop them. Now Malbin understands. He looks at Shimon. \nMALBIN You want to move them all? The old, the sick. They'll never make it. It isn't the first time Tuvia has consigned people to their death, and apparently it won't be the last. \nTUVIA We leave now. Spread the word. \n143 MOMENTS LATER - THE BIELSKI CAMP 143 is a blur of activity as everyone mobilizes for evacuation. Sacks and cooking equipment is tied onto impromptu packs. Asael and Malbin coax the older people into motion-- \nASAEL Come, tateh-- \nOPPENHEIM But my tools-- The SOUND of approaching aircraft. Tuvia searches the sky. Riva pairs each of the elderly with a child. Tamara tucks her newborn under her coat. The SOUND of the approaching aircraft grows LOUDER. People look up, shielding their eyes. Then from out of the sun, two ominous silhouettes: \nSTUKA DIVE BOMBERS! \nTUVIA \nTAKE COVER! \n144 THE SCREAMING WHISTLE OF THE FIRST BOMBER 144 panics the crowd. \n(CONTINUED) \nGOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 97. \n144 CONTINUED: 144 Some race into the forest; others are frozen. Tuvia grabs people and bodily drags them to cover. STRAFING 20MM CANNON chew up the ground. Several people are hit before they can reach cover. Lilka herds everyone she can into: \n145 A BUNKER 145 where people crowd in like sardines. Chaya and Riva gather children around them. They hear the WHISTLE of an incoming shell....BOOM! Dirt from the roof rains down on them. \n146 BOMBS BEGIN TO RAIN DOWN 146 Dirt and debris everywhere. AN INCENDIARY SHELL HITS high in a tree. Its branches burst into flame. An hysterical woman leaps out of a bunker and is BLOWN APART. \n147 MEANWHILE - IN VIKTOR'S CAMP 147 Zus listens helplessly to the distant sound of bombs dropping on his brothers. \n148 BACK IN THE BIELSKI CAMP - A DIRECT HIT ON A ZEMYLANKA 148 It explodes into a million pieces. Wood shrapnel everywhere. Where once was a bunker, now there is only a gaping crater. Tuvia races into the maelstrom to help the wounded. \nAN EXPLOSION KNOCKS HIM DOWN He tries to clear his head but he cannot focus. ALL SOUND FADES AWAY to be replaced by a high-pitched hum. \n149 TUVIA'S WORLD IS IN SLOW-MOTION 149 Falling dirt and debris, tumbling bodies, exploding bunkers -- a surreal effect. \n150 IN REAL TIME -- THE CAMP IS BEING TORN APART 150 Cowering in safety, Malbin sees Tuvia lying in the open and gathers his courage -- RACING through danger to his side. \nMALBIN Are you alright? Tuvia shakes his head, points to his ears. He cannot hear. \n(CONTINUED) \nGOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 98. \n150 CONTINUED: 150 \n162 A RISE REVEALS THE IMMENSITY OF THE KRASNAYA GORKA SWAMP 162 Malbin stares at what lies ahead. \nMALBIN Oh, my God... \n(CONTINUED) \nTAN Revision - 9-10-07 100A. \n162 CONTINUED: 162 \nTUVIA Are the others back yet? (Malbin looks stricken; he shakes his head) ..Asael? Malbin shakes his head once more. Asael is not coming back. Chaya begins to weep. Riva comforts her. \nSHULMAN We've got to keep going! \nBELLA The Germans will be here any minute! \nMALBIN (to Tuvia) Do we wait...a while? \nMORDECAI We could hide... \nMAN #3 I say, fight them here. \nMOTL Yes. Fight! \nSHULMAN That's crazy! Tuvia is in hell. If he waits for Asael, he risks them all being caught. Suddenly it all falls apart. Tuvia sinks to his knees as if his legs can no longer bear his weight. \nMALBIN Tuvia--? Tuvia can't speak. He has no more answers. Nothing to say. He stares at the impenetrable swamp. The end of the line. The sudden vacuum of leadership is felt by them all. They stare at one another, anxious and rudderless. \nWOMAN (ZOE) My father cannot make it. \nRONA There are snakes-- Tamara's newborn is crying. She tries to comfort it. An old woman stares at the swamp in terror. \nMAN #1 (FROHMAN) The children... \nSHULMAN We'll put them on our shoulders. \n(CONTINUED) \nTAN Revision - 9-10-07 100A1. \n162 CONTINUED: (2) 162 \nBELLA Tuvia, what do we do? Oppenheim is petrified. Rona is crying. \nMALBIN \nTUVIA-- And still Tuvia is silent. More arguing. A general MURMUR of dread is rising. Malbin goes to kneel beside Shimon, who is covered in sweat -- undone by the forced march. \nMALBIN (CONT'D) What's wrong with him? \nSHIMON (fighting for breath) ...He... ..is... ..tired. Malbin hears something, looks up. \nFROM HIGH ABOVE - THE SPOTTER PLANE APPEARS They have been found.

Suddenly a VOICE interrupts. \nVOICE Why are we stopping? Everyone turns. It's Asael. Back from the dead. He hands off a wounded comrade to Riva's care. \nASAEL \n(WILD-EYED) They're coming! (to Tuvia) Why aren't we moving? Tuvia looks up at him, lost. Almost helpless. \nASAEL (CONT'D) We must keep going! \nTAMARA In there? \nRONA It is impossible! More murmuring. Asael raises his voice. \nASAEL Nothing is impossible! What we have done is impossible! The murmuring quiets. Asael meets Tuvia's eyes. He is literally willing his older brother to be strong for them, as he has been, time and again. \nASAEL (CONT'D) God will not part these waters. We will do it ourselves. \nRONA But how? \n(CONTINUED) \nGOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 100B1. \n165 AT NIGHTFALL - A SQUAD OF GERMAN SOLDIERS 165 sit around a campfire at the edge of the swamp. \nFROM NEARBY The LIGHTS of their fire can be seen flickering through the reeds as the ragged column MOVES SILENTLY past. \nTUVIA Not a sound. Pass the word. We watch as the ORDER is passed down the line. Parents hold hands over their childrens' mouths. Shimon is carried on an improvised litter made of branches. \nCUT TO: \n166 A FOREST CROSSROADS 166 Panchenko and a few others are on horseback. Behind them the rest of the Partisans are marching away.

Zus looks around at the position. \nZUS For how long? Panchenko's orders are never to be questioned. \nPANCHENKO Until you are ordered to withdraw. \nZUS And if we cannot hold the position? Panchenko looks at Gramov, who stands nearby cradling a submachine gun. \nPANCHENKO Comrade Gramov will enforce discipline, if necessary. Gramov smiles. The implications are clear: nobody retreats. \nPANCHENKO (CONT'D) You have served us well, Comrade. \nZUS (a wintry smile) I am so honored, Comrade. Panchenko wheels his horse and gallops off. Zus and his men take cover in the woods. In the distance we can HEAR the unmistakable SOUND of approaching armor. Lova kneels beside Zus. \nLOVA What are we doing here? Zus? Half a mile down the road, A TANK rumbles into view. \nLOVA (CONT'D) Tell me. Who are we doing this for? With a shaking hand, Zus tries to light a Molotov cocktail but his matches are wet. He reaches into his pocket for more. Instead he finds the mezuzah that was once affixed to his family's door. As he stares at it, the SOUND of the approaching tank grows louder. \nBACK TO: \nYELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 103A-105. \n167 THE KRASNAYA GORKA SWAMP 167 empties at last into a shallow river.

The bedraggled group makes their way across. \n168 OMITTED 168 \n(CONTINUED) \nGREEN Revision - 8-8-07 106-106A. \n169 ON THE OPPOSITE BANK 169 Asael pulls people up onto dry ground. They lie there, freezing and exhausted. Some cannot control their shivering. \nSHULMAN What's next...Sinai? Tuvia can't help but laugh. Soon they are all laughing. It ripples throughout the group. Joyous. Contagious. An overwhelming feeling of relief. They are safe. Tuvia lies on the ground. All the adrenaline has suddenly left his body. Then Aron appears, tugging at his sleeve. Shimon is asking for him. Tuvia kneels down beside his teacher, whose eyes are closed. Malbin is weeping quietly. Who will he argue with? \nSHIMON (a whisper) .Tuvia... \nTUVIA Right here. Shimon is at the end. \nSHIMON ...Something...to say... \nTUVIA Shhhh... \nSHIMON ...no...please... (finding the strength) I almost lost...my faith....but you...were sent..by God..to save us. \nTUVIA Ridiculous. \nSHIMON I know... ... But just...in case... .I thank....HIM... .and I thank you.

The first round EXPLODES among them. Several are killed. \nTUVIA Back to the river! He pushes people down. They cling to the banks, cowering. THOSE WITH WEAPONS take cover, using the embankment as if it were the lip of a trench. They RETURN FIRE -- old men, young women, even some children. \n172 A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY ADVANCES 172 behind the tank, using it as protection. Aron kills one. But the Germans are well-trained. They direct a withering fire -- forcing the partisans to keep their heads below the embankment. \nBUT THE TANK IS UNSTOPPABLE It turns its attentions on the riverbank -- its first round SAILS OVERHEAD, sending up a huge geyser of water. But the next round PLOWS INTO THE EARTH, tearing a huge chunk of earth and killing two of the brigade. TUVIA grabs a satchel and begins filling it with grenades. He throws the satchel over Malbin's head, grabs his arm and races, crouching low, beneath the lip of the riverbank. Asael provides covering fire. So do Lilka, Chaya and the women alongside the men. \nUP AHEAD A stand of trees hides Tuvia from view as he climbs out of the river and heads into the forest. He pulls Malbin down just as A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY approaches and begins to set up a heavy machine gun. \n(CONTINUED) \nGREEN Revision - 8-8-07 107A. \n172 CONTINUED: 172 Tuvia POPS UP behind them, spraying them with his submachine gun. He then turns the heavy machine gun on the infantry advancing behind the tank -- to devastating effect. But now, the tank turns its attention to Tuvia. Its machine gun begins to chew up the forest, forcing Tuvia to take cover. Without pausing to think, Malbin grabs a grenade from the satchel and races toward the tank. It falls pitifully short, exploding harmlessly as Malbin is cut down. \n", "test1_input": "101B BACK TO TUVIA ON HORSEBACK 101B Malbin catches his eye and winks -- clearly this has been part of their \"strategy\" discussions. \nTUVIA Women will learn to use weapons and fight alongside men.

Get them off me! \nCHAYA What? Where? \nLILKA \nEVERYWHERE! OH, MY GOD, OH, MY \nGOD... \nRIVA Lice need somewhere to sleep, too. The others LAUGH, but Lilka is on the verge of hysteria. She stumbles out, stepping on several others as she goes. \n102B OUTSIDE THE BUNKER 102B Crying, she tears at her clothes -- only to discover Tuvia and OTHERS staring at her with interest. She is mortified. \n102C LATER THAT DAY 102C THE WOMEN wash clothes in the stream. Lilka is by the riverbank, scrubbing furiously.

As the ceremony continues, we: \n104C INTERCUT: A TREE LINE OVERLOOKING A MUDDY ROAD 104C Zus, Ben Zion and several BIELSKI FIGHTERS hide alongside TEN RUSSIAN PARTISANS as a GERMAN TROOP TRUCK approaches. Pachenko watches as Zus follows the approaching truck through binoculars, then cocks the heavy machine gun. The truck SLOWS TO A CRAWL as it encounters an overturned PEASANT CART blocking the road. \n104D BACK TO THE WEDDING 104D As Asael kisses the bride, Tuvia is staring not at the newlyweds but rather at Lilka, who has washed and let down her hair. She glances up and meets his eye, then looks away. As Asael crushes the traditional glass underfoot: \n104E ZUS OPENS FIRE. 104E The driver SLUMPS over the wheel and the truck careens lazily off the road. GERMAN SOLDIERS spill out, blindly returning fire as Zus's fighters SWARM down the hill. Several are HIT right away. \n104F INTERCUT: THE GROWING ECSTASY OF THE WEDDING CELEBRATION 104F \nWITH THE FRENZY OF BATTLE.

He ROLLS THE GRENADE under the truck and dives away as it EXPLODES. The remaining Germans RAISE THEIR HANDS. CHEERING PARTISANS leap into the truck, capturing an arsenal of rifles and ammo. THE JEWISH FIGHTERS join in the looting. Boots, coats, blankets, etc. Zus approaches the wounded and captured German prisoners, kneeling in surrender, hands behind their necks. Without hesitation, he shoots them, point-blank, one after another. VIKTOR approaches Zus, who salutes. \nVIKTOR You are related to Bielski? \nZUS I am a Bielski, too.

In a bunker, Malbin and Shimon shiver under a shared blanket. Women and children stare blankly into space. Riva unwraps rags from a man's foot and examines his toes, BLACK with frostbite.

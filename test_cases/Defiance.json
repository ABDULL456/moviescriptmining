Smelled so bad I was afraid the Germans wouldn't want them. \nKOSCIK Maybe for a reduced price. More laughter.

He notices an OLD MAN staring at him. \nOLD MAN You sat in back. Tuvia just looks at him. \nOLD MAN (CONT'D) In school.

A wise choice. \nTUVIA For a dumb schoolboy, you mean. \nSHIMON My whole life I presumed to teach others the right way to live. I had no doubt: this is God's way, this isn't. You'll forgive me if recent events have somewhat shaken my resolve. \nTUVIA It is just like school, I don't know what you're talking about. (touching him) Teacher...Come... Come.

Aron doesn't respond. \nSHIMON (CONT'D) The little one does not talk? \nASAEL He saw. Things. \nTUVIA, MEANWHILE stares fixedly as Avram digs his daughter's grave. The gun is still in his belt.

They burst into flame. \nSHIMON (CONT'D) The Psalms have many uses. \nZUS SITS AMONG THE NEWCOMERS watching as they eat hungrily.

Shimon has brought him soup. \nSHIMON Drink this. \n(WINKS) From the bottom of the pot. Tuvia can barely get the soup down. \nTUVIA ...the way they look at me... with their pasty faces. Let them starve, we're all going to die out here anyway. \nSHIMON Not easy being the big boss. Moses was a lonely man when he led us out of bondage. \nTUVIA ...Moses. \nSHIMON So I'm a sucker for a biblical allusion. But what is society without leaders. Without leaders, we falter. \n(CONTINUED) \nDOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 81A. \n122A CONTINUED: 122A \nTUVIA I am not a leader. \nSHIMON Neither was Moses, but somehow that seemed to work out. \nCUT TO: \n123 THE PARTISAN CAMP 123 Several partisans are singing a drinking song while Zus silently soaks his feet in a bucket. Lova walks in. His face is black and blue. \nZUS Lova, what happened? Who did this? Lova sits and buries his head in his hands. \nZUS (CONT'D) Lova. Tell me. Who? \nLOVA Gramov. Two others.

He is a Jew. The other men LAUGH. Panchenko frowns at Gramov. \nPANCHENKO --and you are an ignorant Tartar. (offers Zus vodka) Ignore him. Here... \nZUS Anti-semitism is a violation of Party discipline. Panchenko sighs. Does he really have to deal with this? \nPANCHENKO He's right, Gramov. Apologize to the Jew. \nGRAMOV I apologize, Jew. \nPANCHENKO There. You see? (...a command) Now drink up. Zus doesn't know what to do. He accepts the vodka. \n124 EXT.

I spent months trying to master Chopin's nocturnes. \nTUVIA I'd love to hear you play. \nLILKA You know Chopin? \nTUVIA Who doesn't? Chopin the butcher from Novogrudok. \nLILKA \n(LAUGHS) If you're well enough to tease me, you're well enough to eat. I'll see what's for supper. She gets up to go. \nTUVIA Thank you, Lilka. \n127 OUTSIDE TUVIA'S BUNKER 127 THE LUBCZANSKI'S have taken the fullest advantage of Tuvia's illness. There are now TWO LINES of people waiting for food. The malbushim line up like prison inmates.

Asael just looks over at the food line -- where Arkady has grabbed Chaya by the waist -- to the delight of the others. Tuvia strides over to them. \nTUVIA (CONT'D) What is this? \nARKADY New policy. Fighters get better food. \nTUVIA Against my orders... \nARKADY You are no longer Commander. Sorry. Tuvia nods, considering his remark for a moment. \nAND THEN TAKES OUT HIS PISTOL AND SHOOTS ARKADY IN THE CHEST! He then turns the gun on Motl and the others -- they literally cower in fear. He raises his voice to those watching. \nTUVIA As long as I am the leader of this group, you will obey my commands. \nTHERE WILL BE NO MORE COMPLAINING! \nNO MORE SITTING! NO MORE DOING \nNOTHING.

Only months ago they were decorous, civilized. Now they are hungry, almost feral. Murderous. Bella has been silently watching. She steps into the circle, looks down at the terrified German man. \nBELLA My son's name was David. David Kagan. We SEE now that she is holding a sharpened hoe. \nBELLA (CONT'D) He was fifteen.

What they have become. \n138 TUVIA STANDS ALONE IN THE FOREST, HIS FACE IN SHADOW 138 He sees Aron, squatting beside a tree, crying silently. Tuvia kneels beside him, cradling him. \nTUVIA Reeboynoy shel oylum... Lord of the Universe. We have done unspeakable things yet still I seek your mercy... He HEARS something.

Zus wears a Nazi jacket. \nZUS He doesn't look good. \nASAEL I could say the same about you. Where'd you get the jacket? \nZUS Let's just say the former owner no longer had need of it. Zus winks. The other bodyguards stare impassively. \nZUS (CONT'D) Embrace me. Asael looks confused for a moment, then embraces him. \nZUS (CONT'D) \n(WHISPERING) Hide this.

DANNY (reading the slip) Oh, man! Come on. Get a job. 
The teacher stares at him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRINCIPAL LOBBY - DANNY 
He sits in a chair next to an office door marked DR. ROBERT SWEENEY - PRINCIPAL. Danny glances at the secretary as she types and talks on the phone. 
TIGHT ON DANNY. He listens to the conversation through the the crack in the door as his eyes swell. 
MURRAY (O.S.) I do not have a problem with him as an individual, alright!? 
SWEENEY (O.S.) Oh shit Murray sure you do.  You hate this kid. 
INT. OFFICE - THE CONVERSATION 
The bespectacled, short-haired MURRAY ROSENBERG, 48, looks over and spots Danny listening outside. Murray walks over and shuts the door. He looks at DR. SWEENEY, who now has his jacket off. 
He points to a typewritten report on the desk and smiles in horror. It is titled BOOK REPORT--MEIN KAMPF. "Daniel Vinvard - American History" is in the upper left hand corner. 
MURRAY This paper is a travesty, Bob! Arguing for Hitler as a civil rights hero?! You've gotta draw a line. 
SWEENEY Murray...it says in your syllabus that they could do their report on any book related to the struggle for Civil Rights. 
MURRAY Oh come on, Bob! 
SWEENEY Let me finish! He needs help...I'm not disputing that. But I read it and I'm not going to throw him out. 
MURRAY His brother probably put him up to it. 
SWEENEY I can guarantee you his brother didn't have anything to do with it, Murray. 
Murray sighs and takes off his glasses. 
MURRAY Don't let him walk scot-free here. For his sake...not mine. You might be all he has left. 
Sweeney stares at the younger teacher and nods. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. OFFICE - THE DOOR OPENS 
Murray walks out and turns back to Sweeney. 
MURRAY Thanks, Bob. 
SWEENEY (O.S.) Okay. Get in here, Dan! 
Danny and Murray make hostile eye contact. 
DANNY I knew it was you. 
SWEENEY (O.S.) Shut up and get your ass in here! 
INT. OFFICE - DANNY ENTERS 
Before he even gets through the door he's chastised. 
SWEENEY What's it gonna be, Dan? 
DANNY What's what going to be? 
SWEENEY This petty shit you're pullin'. 
DANNY Well...I don't know. 
SWEENEY You said it, all right. Sit down. 
Danny does what he's told. Sweeney stares at the teenager and leans back in his chair. 
SWEENEY Are you okay? 
DANNY Yeah. 
SWEENEY Any time you wanna talk, Dan-- 
DANNY Okay.

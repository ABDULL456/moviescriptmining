Something lands on the roof. The DOG flies at the window snarling. MAX jams the barrel against the roof. A face appears, leaning over the windscreen, peering in at MAX. It's the FERAL KID, He grins and tumbles through the passenger's window. He grabs hold of MAX'S hand, shaking it. The FERAL KID laughs, settling in to the seat. The car continues to roll forward.

MAX hits the supercharger switch... The big engine whines up. Once again, the DOG climbs down under the seat. The Humungus machine rockets onto the road... and begins to overtake the other six Marauder vehicles one by one...

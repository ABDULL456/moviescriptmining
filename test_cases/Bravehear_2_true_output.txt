Behind MacClannough are his wife and two daughters; his youngest is barely four, not half William's age; she's a beautiful girl with long auburn hair, and she clings to her own mother's hand, as if the open graves are the mouths of death and might suck her parents in too. 
PRIEST ...Restare in pacem eternis, Amen. 
With the final Amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside, pulling their Children along, to give William a last moment of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies. 
The boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its way down his face. And the tiny girl feels for William in a way that the adults cannot. From the ground she pulls a Scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping William and places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand. 
William looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue eyes hold William's as the grave diggers cover the bodies. 
Then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill above them. Tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, he looks like the grim reaper. 
The girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches in silence as the figure rides down to them. He is ARGYLE WALLACE. He looks like a human buzzard, his face craggy, permanently furious. 
PRIEST You must be the relative of the deceased... William, this is your Uncle Argyle. 
Argyle glowers at the man, dismounts, and glares at William. 
William stares up at this frightening figure. They are interrupted by the ominous sound of approaching horses; a dozen mounted English soldiers, armed with lances, are approaching. Argyle rattles to the priest... 
ARGYLE You were wise to hurry. 
The soldiers ride right in among the mourners and stare down from their saddles, haughty, menacing, their LEADER brusque. 
LEADER Someone dead from this household? 
ARGYLE We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well? 
LEADER What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away. 
ARGYLE My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over. 
LEADER Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds. (to his men) Dig 'em up! 
ARGYLE They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it. 
Outmaneuvered, the leader reins his horse away. Several of the farmers spit on the ground. Argyle glares at them. 
ARGYLE Funeral's over. Go home. 
INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT 
William and Argyle are sitting at the table, eating. Argyle has laid out a proper meal, with exact place settings. 
ARGYLE Not that spoon, that one's for soup. Dip away from you. And don't slurp. 
Argyle sits down and begins to dine with the boy. 
ARGYLE We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors. 
WILLIAM I don't want to leave. 
ARGYLE Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened. 
Argyle pushes his food away; he has no appetite now. 
ARGYLE Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment? 
WILLIAM It was in Latin, sir. 
ARGYLE Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we? (beat) Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et -- (beat) ...It was Malcolm's favorite. 
INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Argyle knows nothing about tucking a boy in bed; he stands awkwardly idle as William scrubs his face at the washstand and crawls into bed. 
WILLIAM Good night, Uncle. 
Argyle grunts and starts out. Then he stops, turns back, leans down over William... and with great tenderness the grizzled old uncle kisses his nephew on his hair. 
INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Argyle sits by the hearth, staring at the embers. He holds the huge broadsword that belonged to his brother. He looks at the handle, like a cross. He whispers... 
ARGYLE "The Lord bless thee and keep thee..." 
Tears of grief spill down the old man's cheeks. 
INT. THE HANGING BARN - IN WILLIAM'S DREAM

BRANDON Walter, it's over.  What use could John Anthony be to you now? Only an idiot would follow him after the streak I've been on. 
WALTER Wrong!  Hot streaks go cold, cold streaks go hot.  Bettors will climb back aboard. 
WALTER CON'D They know you!  And when your luck turns they'll remember you went 80 percent for half the season!  We'll make it all back on the last game and by next year they'll forget everything. 
BRANDON Who said anything about next year? 
WALTER Sports betting's year-round. 
BRANDON I'm not doing this next year. 
WALTER You made a career choice!  I bankrolled it! 
TONI VO Let him go, Walter. 
WALTER and BRANDON turn, see TONI at the door. 
WALTER Of course you stick up for him! 
TONI Meaning what? 
WALTER Who's side are you on? 
TONI I didn't realize I had to choose. 
WALTER (to BRANDON) 
Look, you got a magnificent gift.  Own that.  So you strike out sometimes, big deal, you're swinging for the fences.  You're a champion, Brandon.  A champion goes down 186 times but gets up 187.  I'm not letting you stay down.  This isn't about you or me or Toni, this transcends that -- this is metaphysical, this is cosmic, this is eternal -- this is God... Besides, we have a contract. 
BRANDON Bullshit! 
TONI You can't own someone, Walter. 
WALTER I created the hottest sports tout this country's ever seen! I plugged him, took out full page ads, built a show around him, hooked him up with every major client I have and I will be goddamned if he's going to walk out the door and take all that with him! Why the hell am I even explaining this to you!  This is between me and him!  Get out! 
BRANDON Don't talk to her like that. 
WALTER I need you to tell me how to talk to my wife?  When I'm talking you'll shut your fucking toilet! 
TONI (to BRANDON) 
Leave. 
INT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
BRANDON comes down the hall.  TONI and WALTER heard yelling through the office door.  BRANDON hesitates, walks out and -- 
INT. BRANDON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Dim darkness.  A distant siren bleeds in as -- 
WALTER'S VOICE Brandon... Brandon. 
BRANDON'S POV.  His eyes open.  WALTER'S face fills FRAME. 
WALTER Wake up. 
BRANDON What time is it? 
WALTER Five in the morning.  Listen, I gotta fly to Vegas to meet with some clients.  Hand holding thing.  Keep 'em on board for the final game.  Because you can do this thing, Brandon.  End of the season's the perfect place to turn this streak around.  I'll be back to you out to dinner.  Get you back in the groove.  9:30. Nobu. Gotta catch my flight.  See you tonight.  Look sharp. We're turning it around. 
WALTER backs out, kills the lights.  Darkness returns and -- 
INT. NOBU - NIGHT 
BRANDON alone at a table, sipping a sake when TONI, evening dress, sits next to him. 
BRANDON Hey, I didn't know you were coming. 
TONI Walter was delayed, he's coming back in the morning.  Asked if I'd fill in. 
BRANDON (processing this) 
That's funny, he didn't call me.  You look great. 
TONI silent. 
BRAndon 
You okay? 
TONI Julia did her ballet recital today.  God she was beautiful. 
BRANDON She is. 
TONi 
... He's betting again. 
BRANDON regards her. 
TONI I can't believe I'm here again.  I saw it coming.  I just... I just couldn't stop it. 
BRANDON Nobody could.

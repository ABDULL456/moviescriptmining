19   EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY                                        19 
Lionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out to.. 
...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he trades "No Homo's" with the others. 
Lionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing. 
Not right either. Where does he fit? By surprise... 
GEORGE Lionel right? 
GEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from Nietzsche peek out seductively from under his button up. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) George. We had Civ last semester? How you doing? 
LIONEL Grood...Gate...I'm ah.. 
GEORGE Fan of your stuff. In the Observer? 
LIONEL No one reads the Observer. 
GEORGE You seen this? 
George hands Lionel Sam's "Missing Black Culture" flyer. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) The residents of Armstrong / Parker just made her head of house. Am I crazy or is there a there there? 
LIONEL What made you come over here? 
George holds up Sam's "Ebony & Ivy." Lionel takes it. 
LIONEL (CONT'D) I mean I'm glad you came -- 
GEORGE -- My staff? God bless them. They're whiter than Michael Jackson's kids. We're fucked if anyone of them writes this story and I will not let the transfers at the Gazette do it first. 
LIONEL The oldest one has his face. 
GEORGE You're in the Black Student Union. You probably know Sam. 
Lionel shakes his head "yes" and "no" at the same time. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) You come up with a good angle? I want it in the Bugle. 
Lionel eyes the bold "Bugle" logo on George's shirt. 
LIONEL (aside) Trumpet... 
GEORGE Bugle. Focus. The only paper on campus with a national subscription base and an Advisor from the New York Times? Only so many ways a person can distinguish themselves at a place like this Lionel. You're good. You belong with us. 
The way Lionel fights the smile creeping up his face - we know he's never heard these words. Never belonged any place. Doesn't hurt there's a handsome boy smiling at him either. 
20   INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY                     20 
Troy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. Their opposite facing laptops and a world of tension put a wall between them. 
TROY Get it yet? 
Sam shakes her head yes. 
TROY (CONT'D) Good. You've now got the shared calendar, contacts, and official email. 
Troy throws a smirk her way before pulling out a thick stack of papers. 
TROY (CONT'D) Oh and before I forget. 
SAM Event requests for the year? 
TROY Just this month. They need your approval. Also don't forget to pick your office hours. At least 20 per week. 
SAM That's absurd. 
TROY You're in charge of a hundred residents now. And they need time to complain to your face. About noise. Leaky pipes. Gluten free options in the cafeteria. Etcetera. 
SAM Troy. I didn't think I was going to win. 
TROY And by the way petitioning the President on the Randomization of Housing Act isn't gonna do shit. None of the other houses are concerned. 
SAM Because they all have a legacy of rich and powerful allies on the board who will make sure that "random" works out to their advantage. 
TROY And you think a petition is going to change that?

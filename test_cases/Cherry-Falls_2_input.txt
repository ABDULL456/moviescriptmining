Jody stops, noticing something. 
EXT.  PARKING LOT 
Jody's POV - Kenny is walking to his car with Sharon. 
Sandy sees how upset Jody is. 
SANDY He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him. 
JODY Does she fuck? 
SANDY (trying to comfort) I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. STREET 
Jody is slowly pedaling her bicycle next to Sandy. 
JODY (frustrated) Mr. Jenkins called on me in class today. It was so embarrassing. I was seriously spaced. I'd been thinking about Kenny for over twenty minutes. When I snapped out of it, I looked pathetic. I was teared up. Everyone was staring at me. 
STACY What did you say? 
JODY That I was sorry. I'd drifted off. That I'd been thinking about Stacy and Rod. 
SANDY Oh nice save. 
JODY I was desperate. It was gross. 
SANDY Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you. 
JODY He says he loves me. 
SANDY Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me. 
JODY (musing) Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out. 
SANDY No! 
JODY You're the one always saying 'Just do it'. 
SANDY That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend. 
Jody laughs. 
JODY I don't know what I'm so scared of. 
SANDY Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . . 
JODY How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you. 
SANDY I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference. 
Jody laughs. 
JODY I promised I'd go right home after school. 
SANDY OK. increase the peace. 
Sandy hip-hops up her driveway and into her house. Jody jumps on her bike and pedals off down the street.

EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
The lot is empty except for scores of abandoned shopping carts which a CLERK is banging together. 
NICK gets out of his car and goes in. 
INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT 
Two or three CHECKERS are closing out the registers up front. 
CHECKER She's in back. 
NICK Thanks. 
CHECKER How was huntin'? 
NICK Oh. Fine. 
CHECKER Get anything? 
NICK No. 
CHECKER Too bad. 
NICK goes down a long aisle of bright packages. Coming out at the back he finds LINDA sitting in a green plastic chair, crying. 
NICK Linda... Honey, what's wrong? 
LINDA (helpless shrug) I don't know. 
NICK Hey. Look. There must be something. 
LINDA looks at him, tears streaming down her face. 
LINDA I'm just so lonely. 
NICK C'mon. I've got the car. 
LINDA (shakes her head) I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine. 
NICK walks back down the aisle between the bright packages. 
INT. NICK'S CAR - SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
The CLERK is still collecting abandoned shopping carts. The carts crash and clank as the CLERK rams them together. 
NICK sits behind the wheel, watching the clerk. His hands begin shaking uncontrollably and he gets back out of the car. 
EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NICK'S CAR - NIGHT 
NICK watches the lights go out in the market. LINDA comes out of the door and crosses towards him. 
NICK You okay? 
LINDA nods. NICK fumbles for the door. 
LINDA Let's make love, Nick. 
LINDA takes him in her arms and holds him tight. 
LINDA (CONT'D) Let's make love forever! 
INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT 
LINDA is asleep - lying on her back, arms flung out across the pillows, like a dancer leaping. 
NICK stands beside the bed, wrapped in a blanket, looking down at her. After a moment he draws the covers over her, fusses with her slippers until they are straight and then goes to the window. 
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF NICK'S TRAILER (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT 
The wind is blowing. Bits of trash skitter and swirl in the frozen ruts and a cat comes by, MEOWING. Suddenly a MAN appears walking slowly down the street. The MAN is elegantly dressed in Western attire, wearing a tailored suit with vest, polished boots and a Stetson hat. As the MAN draws under the light of a street lamp he pauses, looking at NICK's trailer. 
THE MAN IS MERLE, OR IF NOT MERLE IT IS A FACE SO STRIKINGLY SIMILAR THAT NICK ALMOST LETS OUT A CRY. 
THE MAN UNDER THE STREET LAMP PAUSES, JUST FOR AN INSTANT, THEN HE TURNS AND MOVES ON DOWN THE STREET. 
INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT 
NICK backs away from the window. For a moment he stands motionless, hardly able to believe his eyes. He looks over at LINDA, he looks down at a chair, then he pushes his face to the window again. 
EXT. STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT 
The street is empty. The MAN is gone.

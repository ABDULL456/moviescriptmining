Vasquez rips off her headset.  She is riveted to the targetting screen, moving ferret-quick in a pivoting dance.  Thunder and lightning.  Better than sex for her.  FLASH-CRACK!  An alien SCREECH from the darkness. 
INT. APC                                                 95 
The battle of phantoms unfolds on the video screens. Ripley flinches as another scream comes over the open frequency.  Wierzbowski's monitor breaks up. His life signs plummet.  Voices blend and overlap. 
HUDSON (voice over) Let's get the fuck out of here! 
HICKS (voice over) Not that tunnel, the other one! 
CROWE (voice over) You sure?  Watch it...behind you.  Fucking move, will you! 
Gorman is ashen.  Confused.  Gulping for air like a grouper.  How could the situation have unravelled so fast? 
RIPLEY (to Gorman) GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW! 
GORMAN Shut up.  Just shut up! 
CRASH!  Crowe's telemetry cuts off like the plug was pulled.  Flat line. 
GORMAN Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over. 
APONE (voice over; heavy static) Say again?  All after incinerators? 
Ripley watches it fall apart. 
GORMAN I said... 
INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      96 
Apone adjusts his headset. 
GORMAN (voice over; static) ...lay down (garbled) ...by squads to...(garbled) 
Gorman's voice breaks up completely.  A SCREAM. Apone whirls, uncertain. 
APONE Dietrich?  Crowe?  Sound off!  Wierzbowski? 
Nothing.  He spins.  Almost blows Hudson's head off. 
HUDSON (freaked) We're getting juked!  We're gonna die in here! 
Apone hands him a magazine.  Hudson slaps it home, looking truly terrified. 
APONE Yeah.  Right.  Right!  Fuck the heat exchanger! 
He FIRES.  Vasquez, nearby, is laying down a horrendous field of fire.  Strobe-bright flashes sear the darkness.  She pivots, firing mechanically in controlled bursts.  Scoring points in her own private video game. 
She SPINS as Hicks approached laterally.  WHAM!  She fires "at" him.  Hicks whirls...to see a nightmarish figure right behind him, catapulted backwards by Vasquez' blast. 
INT. APC                                                 97 
Apone's monitor SPINS CRAZILY AND GOES DARK. 
GORMAN (distantly) I told them to fall back... 
RIPLEY (viciously) They're but off!  Do something! 
But he's gone.  Total brain-lock. 
TIGHT ON RIPLEY  as she struggles with a decision. She's terrified...of what she knows she's about to do.  But more than that, she's furious.  Shouldering past a paralyzed Gorman she runs up the aisle of the APC. 
RIPLEY (in passing) Newt, put your seatbelt on! 
Ripley jumps into the driver's seat of the APC.  Takes a deep breath.  Starts slapping switches. 
GORMAN Ripley, what the hell...? 
She slams the tractor into gear. 
EXT. APC                                                 98 
as the drive-wheels spin on the wet ground.  The massive machine leaps forward. 
INT. APC                                                 99 
Ripley sees smoke pouring out of the complex ahead as she slides sideways onto the descending rampway. She slams the left and right drive-wheel actuators viciously, spinning the machine in a roaring pivot. Gorman lunges forward along the aisle, abandoning his command center. 
GORMAN (shrill) What are you doing?  Turn around!  That's an order!

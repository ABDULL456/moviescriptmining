MICK How much? 
STICKS 'Scuse me? 
MICK How much will they pay you for what you shot today? 
STICKS That depends. Seven, seven-fifty. 
MICK Suppose we take it off your hands for eight. Sticks hesitates, like it's not the legit thing to do. 
MICK (CONT'D) Or do we make it a thousand. 
Sticks hesitates no longer. Takes the tape from the camera and hands it to Mick... who's already counting out money from the roll of cash Ted gave him. To Dobbs-- 
MICK (CONT'D) I can expense this, right? 
DOS Of course. Absolutely. Sticks takes the money, goes. Dobbs, impressed, beaming now-- 
DOBBS (CONT'D) I'll admit, Mr. Haller, you weren't my choice. You were Louis's. Frankly I'd never heard of you. But maybe I should have. Seems to me I've underestimated you. 
MICK Then let's talk about my fees. (before Dobbs can reply) I'll need a hundred thousand up front. Working off five-fifty an hour, it'll come to another hundred thousand if we go to trial. That's estimating the trial at a week. Appeals, we start over. Mick's Lincoln pulls up smoothly to fetch him at the curb. Mick, hand on the door-- 
MICK (CONT'D) I take it that's not a problem. Reaction Dobbs-- hesitates but has no choice. MICK GETS IN, we GLIMPSE THE LINCOLN'S LICENSE PLATE: NT GLTY 2-- CUT TO, 
INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - RAP PLAYS, EARL DRIVES, AS: 
LORNA'S VOICE How'd it go, Mickey? We get the case? 
MICK (into his cell) We've got it if we want it. I'd still like to know the state's case, what they've got on him... 
LORNA'S VOICE What's the difference? 'Course we want the case... Mick says nothing. Gaze out the window. Then... 
MICK I've got an hour til he's released. Til then I'll be at county. With Gloria. (before she says anything) Any calls? 
LORNA'S VOICE Only Sticks. He says he owes you five hundred next time he sees you. 
MICK Yeah he does. 
INT. VISITING AREA, COUNTY DETENTION CENTER, DAY - ON: 
GLORIA Mickey Mantle. You're going to bat for me again? GLORIA, redhead, 27 but good looks already fading-- greets the arriving Mick in a client/attorney booth. 
MICK You don't even know who the Mick was. You don't look good, Gloria. 
GLORIA Thanks. For coming, not for the compliment. Mick's already paging through her arrest-sheet, sees... 
MICK Something new for you, getting booked on possession of coke, along with the usual. 
GLORIA Dumb, I know. A guy paid me with it, I had it on me when I went to my next. 
MICK And your next was a cop. 
She shrugs/nods. Mick keeps turning pages, looking for a break... while... 
GLORIA Can't you get me into one of those rehab places where they get you straight? 
MICK We did a pre-trial rehab, last time. The D.A. won't go for it again. You may have to do some jail here. 
GLORIA I can't. 
MICK Yeah you can. They've got programs in jail, too. Look, you've had a long run. Maybe after this you can finally get out of the life. 
GLORIA And do what? Have kids and plant flowers? Look at me. Mick doesn't have an answer. Opens a notebook, gets to work. 
MICK Okay, tell me what happened. 
GLORIA I did a guy at the Travel Lodge on Santa Monica... 
MICK The one who paid you coke instead of money? 
GLORIA He had a shitload in there. I saw. Which gets Mick's attention. His wheels suddenly turning... 
MICK Do you know who he was? 
GLORIA No. He reached me on my website. He was Mexican or something.

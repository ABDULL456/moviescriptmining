EXT. BLACK ROCK - MAIN STREET CLOSE SHOT - HECTOR 
his long face even more horsey than usual, with half an apple in his mouth. He stands in front of the grocery store, with the baskets of fruit on the sidewalk. He looks up, stops crunching. 
CLOSE SHOT - SAM 
at the window of the Bar & Grill, cleaning an ear with a toothpick. He looks out. The toothpick is motionless. 
CLOSE SHOT - HASTINGS 
fidgeting outside his shack. He looks up. His Adam's apple turns completely over. 
OUT 
Sequence omitted from original script. 
REVERSE SHOT - WHAT THEY SEE 
Macreedy slowly driving the jeep toward Liz's garage. He looks neither to the right nor left. 
GROUP SHOT - FAVORING SMITH AND COLEY 
Standing on the porch of the hotel, watching. Smith's face compresses, and his eyes swivel to rest on Coley's with cold, contemptuous anger. Coley licks his lips uneasily. Smith turns and enters the hotel. Coley meekly follows. 
FULL SHOT - MACREEDY 
He brakes the jeep before the garage. No one is there. He parks the vehicle, gets out and heads down the street. 
EXT. HOTEL 
Macreedy is about to go up the steps when he sees Coley's car at the curb. Both right fenders are creased. An ugly, jagged break has split the front bumper almost in half, one part angling crazily toward the sky, the other drooping in the dust of the road. Smith and Coley come out of the hotel. They stand on the porch, watching Macreedy as he in turn watches the car. They exchange a glance. Smith nods, so... 
COLEY Well, if it's not Macreedy - the world's champion road hog. 
He walks down the steps to the street, joining Macreedy. Smith remains on the porch. 
MACREEDY Yeah. It's a small world. 
COLEY But such an unfriendly one. Now why did you want to crowd me off the road? 
MACREEDY (with a slow grin) I'm kind of sorry if I've incurred your displeasure. 
COLEY Look what you did to my car. 
MACREEDY If there's anything I can do to make up for it... 
COLEY You ought to be careful, man -- all that one-arm driving. 
MACREEDY I'd be glad to pay the damages. 
COLEY It's a threat to life and limb. 
MACREEDY Fortunately no one was hurt. 
COLEY You could get yourself killed that way -- nosin' all over the countryside. 
MACREEDY That's the real danger, I can see that. 
COLEY Why that's pretty smart of you. How long you intend to keep it up? 
MACREEDY I'm getting out of here, right now. 
He walks up the steps, past Smith, and into the hotel. Coley glances up at Smith, grinning with self-satisfaction, like a small boy who has carried out perfectly the instructions of his teacher.

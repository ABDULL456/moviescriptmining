NANCY Is this some kind of come-on? 
PHIL I'm not really sure. We'll have to see. Phil walks off and joins Rita at their camera position. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DINER - LATER THAT MORNING 
Phil is sitting at his usual table, which is covered with an incredible variety of rich foods-- eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, pies, cakes, eclairs, ice cream, puddings, etc. Rita sits across from him, watching in amazement as he stuffs himself with pastry. 
RITA Is this some new fad diet? Don't you worry about cholesterol? Phil scrapes a plate and takes a final bite of a chocolate eclair. 
PHIL I don't worry about anything anymore. 
RITA What makes you so special? Everybody worries about something. 
PHIL That's exactly what makes me so special. He takes a big bite of cake. Rita shakes her head. 
PHIL (with his mouth full) What? 
RITA "The wretch, concentered all in self, Living, shall forfeit fair renown, And doubly dying, shall go down to the vile dust from whence he sprung, Unwept, unhonored, and unsung." Sir Walter Scott. 
PHIL (stares at her for a long moment) "There was a young man from Na n t uc k e t-- " 
RITA That's really funny. When are you going to grow up, Phil? 
PHIL At this rate-- never. (he pulls out a pack of 
CIGARETTES) Okay if I smoke? Rita shrugs. Phil lights up a cigarette. 
RITA You really do have a death wish, don't you? 
PHIL Just the opposite, Rita. I have a life wish. I'm just trying to enjoy it. Taking pleasure in the little things. Don't you ever just want to cut loose and go wild? 
RITA I wouldn't even know what it means to go wild. 
PHIL Yeah, well, that's where I come in. Going wild is one of my specialties. Last night I got completely loaded and drove head- on into a police car. 
RITA 
(DISBELIEVING) Oh, really? You look pretty good this morning. 
PHIL That's my point. I know you won't believe me, but we could do anything we want today and it wouldn't matter one bit. Absolutely no consequences. Complete and total freedom. 
RITA And how. . , do we manage that? 
PHIL You leave that to me. Why don't you send Larry back and hang out with me for the rest of the day? You never make it through that blizzard anyway. Larry enters the diner and spots them. 
RITA I'll take my chances with the -weather. But you have a good time. 
PHIL Don't worry. I plan to. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - NEXT MORNING 
Phil comes through the crowd and finds Nancy in the same spot she was in the day before. 
PHIL Nancy? Nancy turns and looks at him quizzically. 
PHIL Nancy, right? 
NANCY I'm sorry, I-- 
PHIL Nancy Taylor? Lincoln High? I sat next to you in Mrs. Walsh's English class. 
NANCY T h at -- 
PHIL Phil Connors. 
NANCY --is amazing! 
PHIL You don't remember me, do you? 
NANCY I don't-- sure, I think-- 
PHIL We used to shoot spit balls--

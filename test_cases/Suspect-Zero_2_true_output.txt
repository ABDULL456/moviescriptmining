He gestures toward a ravine, where a TOW TRUCK is currently lowering a winch toward an abandoned vehicle. 
It is Harold Speck's Buick, nose-down in the ravine, teetering on a rock, like the balanced scales of justice. 
MACKELWAY Ya run the plates? 
Charlton eyes Mackelway: "Easy, Hot-shot." Mackelway nods, reminding himself to remember his new rank. Dylan hands a preliminary report to Charlton. 
DYLAN Fella's name is Harold Speck. Traveling salesman, from Abilene. 
Charlton eyes the report, then hands it to Mackelway. The hierarchy is being made clear. Very. 
Mackelway turns: this ravine runs right up against a SIGN that reads "Welcome to Texas" on one side and "You are now leaving Oklahoma" on the other. 
A vehicle, left right on the state-line. Odd... 
Then, a NOISE: that Tow-Truck WINCH, grinding badly. It's just about to yank the Buick out of this ditch. 
MACKELWAY (it blurts out) Hey! 
Before Charlton can react, Mackelway is running across this weed-choked lot, zeroing in on the TOW-TRUCK DRIVER. 
10   EXT. ATOP THE RAVINE - CONTINUING                                 10 
The Driver, JUMBO, is operating the winch from a hydraulic handle on the back of the truck. Mackelway barrels in: 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) What the fuck're you doing?! 
JUMBO What's it look like, Bud? 
Mackelway reaches past Jumbo and hits the "Stop" button himself. The winch shuts down. Mackelway turns. A handful of LOCAL COPS stand atop this ravine, watching. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) You guys ever heard of evidentiary procedure? 
No one replies. Charlton approaches. Mackelway tightens, expecting a reprimand for overstepping his bounds. 
MACKWELWAY (CONT'D) Sorry, Sir. There wasn't time. 
Charlton eyes the car. Then Mackelway. 
CHARLTON Did the right thing, Agent Mackelway. Let's have a look. 
Charlton starts down the embankment. Mackelway doesn't, hanging back as he eyes the TRACKS this Buick made before tumbling. Something about them... 
He pulls a small CAMERA from his pocket, a Minox. Snaps off a few photos of the scene - the Buick, the ravine, those tracks, some FOOTPRINTS alongside them. 
Then he heads down the 15-foot embankment. 
11   EXT. RAVINE - CONTINUING                                          11 
It's an ugly sight. Speck is inches from us, but his head is facing in the other direction, twisted unnaturally. 
Mackelway kneels beside the open window, pulls out some gloves, puts them on. He will not lean on the car, or even breathe on it, his caution around evidence obvious. 
CHARLTON (O.S.) What's that? 
Charlton is opposite him, outside the passenger-side window, pointing at the DRAWING that O'Ryan had tossed onto Speck's lap. It lies face down on the seat. 
But something's been FINGER-PAINTED on the back of it: A RED CIRCLE, with a SLASH through it. 
Charlton begins to reach for it, when: 
MACKELWAY (to stop him) Sir? 
Charlton stops. Mackelway indicates: "Gloves." 
Charlton eyes him. It's irritating being corrected by a guy you outrank, especially when he's right. 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Sort of a... stickler for procedure. 
CHARLTON I imagine you would be. 
That was a jab, but we don't know it yet. Charlton puts on his gloves. Mackelway snaps off a few more shots with that Minox, looking over the rest of this car, as: 
GRANGER (aloud) Hey Jumbo. Toss me down a crowbar. 
Granger's by the trunk. Before Mackelway can comment, Jumbo has tossed a CROWBAR down from the top of the embankment: a ten-pound hunk of iron, flying right at us. 
Everybody ducks... as it CLANGS on the roof of the Buick. Jumbo shrugs. 
JUMBO You said toss it. 
Mackelway shakes his head. "Shitkicker." Granger grabs the crowbar. He's just about to open the trunk as: 
MACKELWAY Hold it a second. 
Granger pauses. Mackelway crosses to the trunk, and snaps off a few shots with the Minox. 
Something catches his eye, along the line of the TRUNK. He kneels closer... An odd RESIDUE, crusty and hard, has formed a thin line on top of the paint in a single post. 
He takes out a VIAL, and scrapes some of the residue into it. Then he sniffs it. Pauses... 
MACKELWAY (CONT'D) Smells like... clove. 
He looks to Granger: now you can open the trunk. 
DYLAN (re: Mackelway) Where the hell'd you find this guy? 
CHARLTON Field Office. Dallas.

DIANE 
And don't make any noise. 
INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT 
The lights are full on now. Lizzy sits on the bed clutching a blanket around herself. 
Tommy hops around in his underwear, searching desperately. 
All the videos are opened and scattered everywhere. LIZZY 
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy? 
TOMMY 
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake. 
LIZZY 
Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick. 
INT. DIANE'S HOME, LIVING-ROOM. MORNING 
Renton lies submerged under a blanket. 
The sounds of a normal morning travel from a room nearby: whistles, radio, voices. 
Renton peeps over the edge of the blanket, then covers his head again. 
INT. GAIL'S BEDROOM. MORNING 
Spud opens his eyes. With his fingers, he feels crusted liquid around his mouth. 
Abruptly he turns around: the bed is soaked in vomit. 
He looks under the cover and drops it again in revulsion. 
INT. DIANE'S HOME, LIVING-ROOM. DAY 
Renton pulls himself up off the sofa and dresses as quickly as possible. 
INT. GAIL'S BEDROOM. DAY 
Spud wipes the vomit from his chest with a pillowcase, which he dumps in the middle of the sheets before gathering the whole lot up as a bundle. 
INT. DIANE'S HOME, HALL/KITCHEN. DAY 
The door swings open. A Man and a Woman, about Renton's age, sit at the kitchen table. They look up to see Renton in the doorway. MAN 
Good Morning. 
WOMAN 
Come in and sit down. You must be Mark. 
Renton walks to the table and sits down. RENTON 
Yes, that's me. 
WOMAN 
You're a friend of Diane's? 
RENTON 
More of a friend of a friend, really. 
MAN 
Right. 
RENTON 
Are you her flatmates? 
The couple exchange a look and laugh. WOMAN 
Flatmates. I must remember that one.

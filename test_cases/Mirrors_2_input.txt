In the darkness, a rat glides peacefully on the water surface. 
In the basement, the water level continues to rise. 
With a flashlight in hand, and his feet submerged in the water, Ben moves deeper into the tunnel. 
He is searching for the source of the leak. The beam of light sweeps across the walls and the piping. 
Ben crosses an intersection. In the corner, on the tiled wall, he barely discerns an old inscription ingrained with decades of dust and dirt. He sinks his hand into the water and wipes it off, revealing an arrow pointing to, ST JOHN'S DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY. 
He continues his exploration of the subterranean passageways. 
Suddenly, he notices a darker area on the wall. He comes closer and discovers a brownish damp-spot, covered with mold. The humidity has pearled into droplets. 
He has found the source of the leak. 
His hand brushes the wall, causing it to crumble instantly. Ben digs into the plaster as if it were butter, bringing a cracked water pipe to light. The leakage has damaged the wall in which the tubing was embedded. 
Ben hears the echoing sound of streaming water, as if there were another room on the other side of the wall. 
He pushes against the saturated wall, and pierces through it with his arm. He removes his arm. For a moment, he observes the gaping black hole that he has just left behind. 
Ben peeks through the hole with his flashlight, but he cannot make out what is on the other side. 
He makes the hole bigger, until the passage is large enough for him to crawl through- 
ON THE OTHER SIDE, HE DISCOVERS A LARGE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ANOTHER ROOM- AN OCTAGONAL ONE WHOSE EACH AND EVERY WALL, INCLUDING THE CEILING, IS MADE OF GIGANTIC TWO WAYS MIRRORS. 
One of the mirrors is opened, ajar- It's a door. 
He enters.

His image is reflected in all directions and from infinite angles. Ben moves towards the center of the room- 
ALTHOUGH THE ROOM SEEMED EMPTY BEFORE, SOMEBODY IS NOW STANDING IN THE CORNER. 
It's a well-built man. He too is wearing the blue security guard's uniform. 
From where he stands, Ben can only see the back of the man's head. As he moves in closer, he can make out the name embroidered on the man's shoulder- 
IT'S GARY LEWIS, THE FORMER NIGHT WATCHMAN! 
BEN Gary? 
The silhouette remains still. 
BEN (CONT'D) Gary? 
Ben comes a bit closer. 
His gaze freezes when he realizes that Gary is not standing in front of the mirror with his face pressed against it, but- 
HE IS BEHIND THE MIRROR, INSIDE! 
Ben steps back, terrified. 
He doesn't know how to interpret this new phenomenon. 
Ben gathers his courage and returns in front of the mirror- 
Knock, knock, knock... 
He hits the mirror with his fist, as if it were merely a glass window behind which Gary Lewis was standing, on the other side- 
No reaction. Ben strikes the mirror harder. 
Knock, knock, knock... 
The former night watchman turns around slowly towards Ben, revealing his face little by little... 
CUT TO: 
51   INT. DAY - QUEENS APARTMENT                                       51 
Knock, knock, knock...

51   CONTINUED:                                                     51 
In his bed, Ben wakes up with a jolt- THE ENCOUNTER WITH GARY WAS A DREAM. 
Knock, knock, knock... 
Somebody is knocking at his door. Ben gets up from the couch- 
BEN Coming... 
Ben opens the door to a UPS deliveryman holding out a package- 
DELIVERYMAN Mr. Carson? (Ben nods) Would you mind signing here, please?

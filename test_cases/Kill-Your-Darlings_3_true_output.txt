MARION CARR When Lucien went to Bowdoin, David appeared out of thin air. So I sent Lu to Chicago. 
Allen registers the reference from Lucien's conversation with the Dean, a dim clue. Marion goes back to packing. 
MARION CARR Surprise, David turned up there too. Then, when Lucien wanted to go to Mexico, guess who had a car idling in the driveway? 
ALLEN But he didn't have to go with him. 
MARION CARR He spun a web to ensnare my son. That's why I brought him here. A lot of good that did. 
Marion finds Lucien's cravat, quickly folds it, hides it in the suitcase. Allen notices. 
ALLEN What happened in Chicago? 
Marion stops packing. Thinks. She settles on the bed, charms Allen with a smile. 
MARION CARR Thank God Lu has you in his life. He talks about you all the time. 
She leans over and slips the cigarette from Allen's hands into her own. Inhales seductively. 
MARION CARR You know what Allen? He calls you his guardian angel. 
ALLEN That's what he called David. 
She exhales, her face falls. Leans in threateningly. 
MARION CARR That man ruined my son. You're going to help me keep what's left of him. 
INT. BURROUGHS'S APARTMENT (69 BEDFORD) - NIGHT 
The zip of a suitcase. Bill, undoing his den, packing away clothes, books. He's also leaving town. Allen's come for answers --- from the only person who knew the real David. 
BILL Contrary to reports, prison is not a tonic for the spirit. 
We are now realizing it's the end of a chapter for all of them. 
BILL All the district attorney cared about was if David was queer. 
Allen gulps. The heart of the issue, thrust into the light. 
ALLEN And what did you tell them? 
Bill sees the box of morphine from his night with Norman. He decides to take it with him, hides it under a pile of shirts. 
BILL I said yes. 
ALLEN Did David do something Lu in Chicago? 
BILL Christ Allen, please don't get involved. 
ALLEN I have to be. I'm helping him write his defense. 
Bill paces, then turns to face Allen. 
BILL David was my friend. But he's dead. And did Lucien tell you how he died? 
Allen shakes his head. He has no idea. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
The moment right after Lucien stabbed David. What we have not seen yet. The story continues. 
David trembles on the ground, bleeding from the knife would. Lucien stands above, realizing what just happened. 
Car headlamps swipe across Lucien's face. Terrified, Lucien scans the park for witnesses. 
BILL (O.S.) He might not have wanted you to know, Allen. He tied David up. 
Lucien DRAGS David's body from the park under a railing to the shoreline. 
He unties his shoes, LASHES David's hands together with the shoelaces. Ties them tight. 
David groans and gurgles blood. Still very much ALIVE. 
Lucien rustles through David's pockets -- pulls out anything side. He tosses David's pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes, now speckled with blood - to the sand. 
Lucien collects stones from the riverbank, STUFFS them into David's pockets.

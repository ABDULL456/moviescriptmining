MARIANNE Do not be alarmed, Mamma. 
The STRANGER deposits MARIANNE on the sofa. They look straight into each other's eyes. Electric. 
THE STRANGER I can assure you it is not serious. I took the liberty of feeling the bone and it is perfectly sound. 
ELINOR raises her eyebrows at MARIANNE, who blushes to her roots. 
MRS DASHWOOD Sir, I cannot even begin to thank you. 
THE STRANGER Please do not think of it. I'm honoured of be of service. 
MRS DASHWOOD Will you not be seated? 
THE STRANGER Pray excuse me--I have no desire to leave a water mark! But permit me to call tomorrow afternoon and inquire after the patient? 
MRS DASHWOOD We shall look forward to it! 
He turns to MARIANNE and smiles. She smiles back gloriously. He bows, and sweeps out of the room. 
MARIANNE (hissing) His name! His name! 
MRS DASHWOOD silences her with a gesture and follows him out with all the solicitous charm she can command while MARGARET pokes her head around the door to watch. ELINOR is removing MARIANNE's boot and trying not to laugh at her. 
EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY 
MRS DASHWOOD calls out after him. 
MRS DASHWOOD Please tell us to whom we are so much obliged? 
The STRANGER mounts Bedivere and turns to her. 
THE STRANGER John Willoughby of Allenham--your servant, ma'am! 
And he gallops off into the mist--we almost expect Bedivere to sprout wings. CLOSE on MRS DASHWOOD's excited expression. 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY 
MRS DASHWOOD runs back into the parlour, jittering with excitement and anxiety. 
MARIANNE Mr John Willoughby of Allenham! 
MRS DASHWOOD What an impressive gentleman! 
MARIANNE He lifted me as if I weighed no more than a dried leaf! 
ELINOR Is he human? 
MARIANNE hits ELINOR. MRS DASHWOOD tends to her ankle. 
MRS DASHWOOD Tell me if I hurt you. 
ELINOR (regarding Marianne's ecstatic expression) She feels no pain, Mamma. Margaret, ask Betsy to make up a cold compress, please. 
MARGARET (leaving reluctantly) Did you see him? He expressed himself well, did he not? 
MRS DASHWOOD With great decorum and honour. 
MARIANNE And spirit and wit and feeling. 
ELINOR And economy--ten words at most. 
From below stairs we can hear MARGARET wailing Wait for me! 
MARIANNE And he is to come tomorrow! 
ELINOR You must change, Marianne--you will catch a cold. 
MARIANNE What care I for colds when there is such a man? 
ELINOR You will care very much when your nose swells up. 
MARIANNE You are right. Help me, Elinor. 
MARGARET comes back with the bandages. 
MARGARET What has happened? 
ELINOR We have decided to give you to the Gypsies. 
ELINOR and MARIANNE go upstairs. MARGARET whispers to MRS DASHWOOD. 
MARGARET Will they be married before Edward and Elinor, do you think, Mamma? 
MRS DASHWOOD Margaret, you are worse than Mrs Jennings. 
EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - MORNING 
The rain has cleared. SIR JOHN's horse munches grass contentedly by the side of the road. 
SIR JOHN (V.O.) Mr Willoughby is well worth catching, Miss Dashwood--Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself! 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - MORNING 
The DASHWOODS are having a frustrating time winkling information about WILLOUGHBY out of SIR JOHN, who is in turn only anxious to protect BRANDON's interest. MARIANNE has her bandaged foot up on the sofa and is fast losing patience.

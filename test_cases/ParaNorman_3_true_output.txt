Norman wearily walks through the splintered roots to find his family. Sandra shouts out when she sees him. 
SANDRA BABCOCK Norman? Norman! Sandra runs over to him and scoops him up in her arms, hugging him tightly. 
SANDRA BABCOCK (CONT'D) My brave little man! I thought I was going to lose you! 
NORMAN Mom, you're embarrassing me. 
SANDRA BABCOCK That's my job. 
COURTNEY Good job, Norman. Perry takes a deep breath and looks at his son. There is relief and a hint of admiration in his eyes. 
PERRY BABCOCK Well done, Son. You did it. The Judge, stood some way behind them, lets out a GROAN, and the Babcocks turn to look at him. ParaNorman 92. 
144 CONTINUED: 144 They watch in awe as the Judge begins to turn to dust, his ragged clothes and decayed body dissolving in the rain. For barely a moment a shimmering ghostly figure is left behind, an image of the man that once was. The spirit blinks sorrowful eyes, then becomes nothing more than a million glowing fragments dissipating on the breeze.

EXT. NEW TOWN HALL - LATER 
The sky has lost its lurid pall, and the clouds are now lighter and less menacing. In the Town Square, clusters of townsfolk are trying to come to terms with the night's events. Norman weaves through the crowd away from the Babcock's station wagon, searching for Neil. He hears small snippets of conversation as he goes. Dwayne waves his notebook under Hooper's nose. 
DEPUTY DWAYNE So, uh, are we gonna need statements? She slaps it out of his hand. 
DEPUTY DWAYNE (CONT'D) Ow! That was my finger nail. Slob Guy, Crystal and Mrs Henscher are convincing each other of their excuses. 
MRS HENSCHER You know what it's like. You join a mob and you say things. I was merely inhabiting the role. 
SLOB GUY Yeah, it was the others. They pushed me into it. Norman smiles as he passes Alvin, regaling a bunch of teenagers. 
ALVIN Yeah, me and Norman are in a lot of the same classes. Pretty much inseparable. Best buds. And we do a lot of psychic investigations together. We have a blog actually, you should check it out. Nearby, Courtney wastes no time cozying up to Mitch. ParaNorman 93. 
146B CONTINUED: 146B 
COURTNEY So I was thinking, maybe we could catch a movie sometime? Nothing scary. 
MITCH That sounds great, Kathy! Y'know, you're gonna love my boyfriend! He's like a total chick-flick nut! Courtney stares at him, at a loss for words, then successfully reads between the lines and turns away 
MUTTERING. Norman eventually finds Neil sat upon the witch statue's broken plinth, attempting to piece it back together pebble by pebble. 
NORMAN Hey Neil. He climbs up beside his friend, who beams at him gleefully. 
NEIL You did it! You stopped the witch's curse and made the zombies go away and saved pretty much everything! 
NORMAN I guess. I just wanted to say thanks. You stood by me. All the time. 
NEIL Yeah, of course. Don't get weird or anything. So you think now everything's gonna turn back to normal? Norman looks across the square. The smoldering buildings, the fallen signposts, the warped trees, the rubble...

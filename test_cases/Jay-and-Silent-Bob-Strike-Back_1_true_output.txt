JUSTICE (smiling) You remembered. (back to business) It was a frame-up, Jay. Sissy. Missy, Chrissy, and I are international jewel thieves. We were setting you up as a patsy, but I couldn't go through with it, because I... because I love you. 
JAY Yeah? So that means you'll fuck me, right? 
VOICE (O.S.) If she does, it'll be considered necrophilia. 
All turn to see Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy slinking from the shadows, guns drawn. 
SISSY Because she's gonna be one dead bitch. (to Justice) Hi, Jussy. We catch you at a bad time? 
MISSY You should've just let these guys go down, Jussy. 
JAY Hey, I wanted to go down, but I was waiting until I got to know her a little better. See, there was this little angel on my shoulder, and he said-- 
CHRISSY Shut the fuck up before I shoot you where you stand in your pansy red booties. 
JAY (looking down) Holy shit, I am wearing pansy red booties! (to Bob) Man--why the fuck didn't you tell me? 
SISSY Let's have those diamonds, Jussy. 
JUSTICE I can't do that, Sissy 
SISSY (points her gun at Jay) Then lover--boy gets one in the brain. 
CHAKA YO! 
All turn to look at Chaka. 
CHAKA Would any of you lovely ladies like a private audition to be in my movie? 
Justice high-kicks the gun out of Sissy's hand. It lands on the ground discharging. Then everyone starts shooting and running for cover. 
Jay and Silent Bob hurl themselves over the Bluntmobile. 
Missy and Chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely-packed craft service table labeled. CAST. They pop back up and start firing at Willenholly. Willenholly leaps behind a barren craft service table that holds a bag of Smarties and a dented can of RC Cola. He pops up and returns fire. When both are out of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and reload. From behind his table, 
Willenholly yells-- 
WILLENHOLLY WHY ARE YOU SHOOTING AT ME?!?! I'M JUST A FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL!!! 
CHRISSY TWO REASONS: ONE--WE'RE WALKING, TALKING BAD GIRLS, CLICHES! 
MISSY AND TWO: BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN. 
WILLENHOLLY ONLY ON THE OUTSIDE! 
The Girls and Willenholly both pop back up and open fire again. 
Chaka ducks behind the monitor. 
CHAKA A shitload of white people with guns? Time to get my black ass out of here! 
He races off, passing Justice and Sissy, who circle each other defensively, striking kung fu poses. 
SISSY You really let me down, Justice. Throwing it all away for a little stoner with bad pronunciation. 
JAY (O.S.) HEY! 
JUSTICE (ignoring him) What's it gonna be, Sissy? Which fighting style do you want me to kick your ass in? 
SISSY Are you kidding me? I taught you all all your moves myself. There's not a style you can bust that I can't defend against. 
JUSTICE You're no match for my "Shaolin Monk." 
SISSY Yeah, but I can bury you with my "Crouching Tiger." 
JUSTICE A little "Venus's--flytrap"? 
SISSY I'll counter with "Dragon Crane." 
JUSTICE How about a little "Bitch, My Man Ain't Yo Baby's Daddy"? 
SISSY (beat; smiles) Bring it on. 
Justice rushes Sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch into a down-and-dirty, girl's cat-fight; hair pulling and screaming. 
Behind the Bluntmobile, Jay and Bob watch all the action. 
JAY Yo--I hope one of 'em rips the other one's shirt off and we see some tit.

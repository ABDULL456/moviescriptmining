JACK You were sayin'...? 
Quoyle sucks it up. 
QUOYLE His whole life would be changed. If he could come upon. A fishing license. 
Jack's eyes.   Flat and cold as the cod he's gutting. 
JACK Well, there's only one a those issued per family. So how exactly would he do that? 
This is not.   Going well.   A dangerous silence. 
JACK Even doughnuts, y'know.   Can push their luck. 
INT. WAVEY'S PARLOR - DUSK 
The day care contingent more organized today. Sort of. Bunny leading a spirited round of red-light/green-light, as... 
...Quoyle enters with a big cardboard box full of presents. As he shrugs off his coat, he looks at the Christmas tree, its winking lights. The decorations that seem to be everywhere, many handmade by these children. He watches Bunny call out 'Red Light!', only to have Herry ignore it and tackle her anyway. 
Mixed emotions, to be sure. A feeling of family he can at least visit, yet will never be his own. The sad edge catches up with him, so he strolls on into... 
...the kitchen. Wavey baking, what else.      She smiles to see him. A friend's smile. 
WAVEY (Southern belle) Why, Mistuh Quoyle. You shouldn't have! 
He smiles back.    Takes her in for a telling beat, before... 
QUOYLE Uh.   I didn't. Most of these 
are for Herry. 
Even better. 
QUOYLE There's two. Are yours. 
They are on top. Personally wrapped in his slightly bulging, fine-motor-control-challenged, personal style. Be sets them on the counter. 
QUOYLE You prob'ly want to wait for Christmas. 
Meaning, please don't. So she wipes her hands on her apron.    Lets him see her eyes dance just a flicker. 
WAVEY Oh, I'm much too excited. 
Delicately unwraps the first. Lifts out a PORCELAIN TEAPOT, finely painted with an assortment of BERRIES. She holds it in her hands, at once admiring and wistful. Wondering if there's a message about their moment together while berry-picking. 
QUOYLE It's from a museum catalogue.       But it's not real. It's a copy. 
WAVEY (still gazing at it) It is my favorite teapot. 
A simple pronouncement. She opens the second, flat and narrow. It is a TURQUOISE BRACELET. Actually, kind of stunning. She blinks, taken back by the beauty and perhaps the expense. 
QUOYLE It's nice for your eyes.     I thought. 
She doesn't sayanything.   Lets it dangle from her fingers, catch the light. 
QUOYLE It's for everyday. You don't have to save it for special. 
She looks to him. Her eyes are shining maybe more than she wants. Her voice perhaps softer than she even intends... 
WAVEY Oh, I'll save this, all right. 
Covers.   With only a slightly more than friendly smile. 
WAVEY And I'll think of you.     When I 
put lot on. 
He can only nod. He'd like that.    She holds up one finger, wait a second. And hurries off. 
So he waits. Looking at her kitchen. Feeling his feelings.         She is back, with two boxes. Sets them down. Nods, go ahead... 
...one is heavy and square. He opens it to find a LEATHER-BOUND CASE. He looks at her, smiles in his childlike way. Opens the case, which reveals... 
...two leather-bound VOLUMES. One a dictionary.      The other a thesaurus. He is obviously moved. 
QUOYLE (a murmur) You must have me mistaken. For a writer. 
And when he looks up. 
WAVEY I don't make mistakes.     About that kind of thing. 
He stares at her long enough to make her nod toward the other package. Big and flat, but not heavy at all. He lifts the lid, and pulls out... 
...a huge comfy SWEATER.   In oxblood wool.    He is completely stunned to realize... 
WAVEY (so pleased) Well, you can't be surprised. You've seen me knitting it for months. 
QUOYLE It was so big, I thought it was a tea cozy for your car. But if it's for me, it has to be bigger, huh? 
Put it on, put it on! So he slips it over his head. Big enough and then some. This worries her. She plucks at it... 
WAVEY Well.   You'll grow into it. 
QUOYLE You kiddin'? After the holidays, we'll have to stretch it. 
He's just beaming. Hugs himself to show how warm it is.      The silence is companionable. Then... 
QUOYLE Not used to a woman.     Giving me presents. 
She raises a brow.     Can scarcely believe that. 
QUOYLE One Christmas with Petal, I gave her eleven things. And I wrapped them. And watched her open them up. 
She holds her friendly smile.     But her eyes have changed. Slightly.

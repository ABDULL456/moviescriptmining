FADE IN: 
On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars. Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come. 
1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1 
A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves down the street and heads out of town. 
2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2 
The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point at the sky. JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from spare parts of other devices. 
JANE Hurry! We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below. Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as well, rubbing his head. 
JANE (CONT'D) Oh-- watch your head. 
SELVIG Thanks. So what's this "anomaly" of yours supposed to look like? 
JANE It's a little different each time. Once it looked like, I don't know, melted stars, pooling in a corner of the sky. But last week it was a rolling rainbow ribbon-- 
SELVIG 
(GENTLY TEASING) "Racing "round Orion?" I've always said you should have been a poet. Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity.

JANE Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and my gloves, will you? Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin. 
JANE (CONT'D) Not until you see it! 
SELVIG (re: the gloves) I recognize those. Think how proud he'd be to see you now. Jane's grin fades to a sad smile. 
JANE Thank you. 
SELVIG For what? 
JANE The benefit of the doubt. The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2. 
JANE (CONT'D) It's never taken this long before. Darcy calls up from the front seat. 
DARCY (O.S.) Can I turn on the radio? 
JANE (an edge to her voice) Sure, if you like rocking out to KFRM, "All agriculture, all the time." Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle. 
3 INT. SUV - NIGHT 3 
The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the frustrated Jane with sympathy. 
JANE The anomalies are always precipitated by geomagnetic storms. She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book, tracking occurrences and patterns. 
JANE (CONT'D) The last seventeen occurrences have been predictable to the minute... I just don't understand. Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror. She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert. 
DARCY Jane? Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of champagne begins to vibrate. 
JANE There's got to be some new variable... Or an equipment malfunction... The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A. 
DARCY I don't think there's anything wrong with your equipment... The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3. They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane. 
DARCY (CONT'D) Jane? 
JANE What?! 
DARCY I think you want to see this. Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over the desert -- 
MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded. 
JANE Holy. Shatner. 
SELVIG That's your "subtle" aurora?! 
JANE No-- yes! Let's go!

Holds her breath. \nREESE (V.O.) Sarah? \nFULL SHOT - She scrambles out from beneath the desk and runs to him in the thickening smoke. \nCUT TO: \n177     CONNECTING OFFICES                                     177 \nPANAGLIDE FOLLOWING REESE AND SARAH as they cross the corridor and move through a series of offices, doubling back toward the main entrance. \nCUT TO: \n178     INT. OFFICE                                            178 \nSarah and Reese move rapidly through the smoke. Gunfire sounds nearby.  They pass bodies. \nVUKOVICH (V.O.) (weakly) Reese! \nThey find the Lieutenant propped in a corner, dying. Reese bends toward him. Vukovich holds out his custom Colt Python .357. \nVUKOVICH (continuing) You just keep her alive.  Do what you have to. \nReese snatches the gun and the keys and runs on. \nC.U. - VUKOVICH watching them go. \nCUT TO: \n179     INT./EXT. OFFICES/SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT                179 \nFAST PANAGLIDE PRECEDING TERMINATOR as he runs through the smoky rooms.  A fire is burning, lighting everything a flickering orange. He emerges onto a landing through a side entrance.  PAN to follow his line of sight as he snaps the AR-180 to his shoulder.  B.G. a BLUE VOLKSWAGEN RABBIT is roaring away across the parking lot. \nTIGHT ON TERMINATOR aiming carefully.  He pulls the trigger. It clicks...empty.  Slowly he lowers the scope-sight from his eye and watches them go. \nTerminator limps down the steps from the landing and walks away as the fire spreads behind the windows of Division Headquarters. \nCUT TO: \n180     INT. RABBIT - NIGHT                                    180 \nDETAIL - GAS GAUGE, it reads EMPTY. \nCUT TO: \n181     EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                   181 \nThe Rabbit is stopped on the shoulder of a two lane secondary road winding through the hills north of L.A. Reese is fishing objects out of the car's trunk and handing them to Sarah, who holds a flashlight. He hands her a blanket, some road flares, and a first aid kit.  Then he slams the trunk.  Reaching through the side window, he turns the wheel and pushes the car off the shoulder, over the embankment. \nDOWN ANGLE INTO RAVINE, past Sarah and Reese, as the car trundles down crashing through the underbrush to dis- appear among the trees. \nReese looks out across the valley and the lights of L.A. A helicopter circles in the distance, searchlight on. \nREESE Let's get off the road. \nCUT TO: \n182     INT./EXT. DRAINAGE CULVERT - NIGHT                     182 \n", "test3_id": 2813}

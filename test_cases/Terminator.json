SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                1 \nSilence.  Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes audible.  A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link fence and on the other by the one-story public school build- ings.  Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha- dows.  This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar neighborhood. \nANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, where a trash dumpster looms in a LOW ANGLE, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium. A CAT enters FRAME.  CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, prowling with him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows. \nCLOSE ON CAT, which freezes, alert, sensing something just beyond human perception. \nA sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening WHINE. Papers blow across the pavement. The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster. Windows rattle in their frames. The WHINE intensifies, accompanied now by a wash of frigid PURPLE LIGHT.  A CONCUSSION like a thunderclap right over- head blows in all the windows facing the yard. \nC.U. - CAT, its eyes are wide as the glare dies. \n1A/FX   ANGLE - DUMPSTER                                       1A/FX \nELECTRICAL DISCHARGES arc from the dumpster to a water faucet and climb a drain pipe like a Jacob's Ladder. \nCUT TO: \n2       EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                2 \nSLOW PAN as the sound of stray electrical CRACKLING subsides. FRAME comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling, faced away, in the previously empty yard. He stands, slowly. The man is in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built, moving with graceful precision. \nC.U. - MAN, his facial features reiterate the power of his body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue and depthless.  His hair is military short. \nThis man is the TERMINATOR. \nHe glances down, taking calm inventory of himself, and notices that a fine white ash covers his skin.  He brushes at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence, scanning his surroundings. \nCUT TO: \n2A/FX   CRANE SHOT - SCHOOLYARD/CITY - NIGHT                   2A/FX \nCAMERA MOVES UP as Terminator approaches the schoolyard fence beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the cityscape below.  The school is perched at the edge of a pro- montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem- ing and glistening under a sullen sky.  The night clouds are shot through with occasional flashes of LIGHTNING, presaging a thunderstorm. \nTerminator stands, hands on hips in prefect symmetry, gazing down at the city as the CAMERA REACHES FULL HEIGHT. \nCUT TO: \n3       EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT                               3 \nA beer bottle SMASHES on the ground.  PULL BACK to include its ex-owner and his two compatriots, YOUTH GANG MEMBERS, lounging on the jungle gym of a deserted playground.  They sport nondescript PUNK REGALIA...torn T-shirts, fatigue pants, combat boots or high-top sneakers, leather jackets. \nThe leader notices something and sits up. \nLEADER (pointing) Hey, hey...what's wrong with this picture? \nANGLE - REVERSE, seen past the lounging toughs, Terminator walks naked into a pool of streetlight, striding purpose- fully toward them. \nANGLE - OVER TERMINATOR'S SHOULDER, as he approaches them. They slide from their perches and drop easily to the ground liquid shadows. \nLEADER Nice night for a walk, eh? \nTerminator stops right in front of them. \nTERMINATOR (without inflec- tion) Nice night for a walk. \nThey surround him, all swagger and malign good humor. \nSECOND PUNK Washday tomorrow, huh?  Nothing clean, right? \nTerminator eyes them without expression, unhurried. Reptilian. \nTERMINATOR Nothing clean.  Right. \nLEADER This guy's a couple bricks short. \nTerminator turn to the second punk, ignoring the others. \nTERMINATOR Your clothes.  Give them to me. \nThe punks exchange glances, dismayed. \nTERMINATOR (coldly) Now. \nSECOND PUNK (bracing) Fuck you, asshole. \nWithout warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple with blinding speed.  The blow flings him with a CLANG into the jungle gym.  He drops to the ground in a still heap, eyes open, twitching. \nThe leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one motion.  Terminator ducks back and catches the knife- wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip.  Then he punches the leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone. \nANGLE - PAVEMENT, as the knife clatters down.  The punk's combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground. \nANGLE - TWO SHOT, Terminator and the leader are close together as if dancing, but motionless.  Their bodies are in total shadow.  The punk's eyes are wide, his veins distended with an agonizing pressure.  Terminator jerks his fist back with a WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME. \nReese finds himself among the display racks of a discount department store.  A searchlight stabs in the front window as he dashes into the maze of aisles. \nThree cops enter behind him through the shattered door. \nFAST PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, as he crab-runs low among the moving shadows where flashlights quarter the darkness.  He bolts the open space behind a display window.  Sees the outside searchlight sweep toward him.  Freezes. \nANGLE - REESE, his feral face frozen among the smooth- featured, smiling mannequins.  As the light passes, Reese silently moves on. \nANGLE - COP, passing the end of a long aisle B.G. while in the F.G. a hand ENTERS FRAME, removing a knit shirt from a hanger.  Reese slips the shirt on quietly and does a fast crab-walk across the aisles to melt into the other racks and shadows, CAMERA MOVING LOW with him. \nCUT TO: \n13      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/AISLE - NIGHT                    13 \nWith a shocking GROWL the police dog hurtles out of the shadows, LEAPING RIGHT AT CAMERA. \nANGLE - REESE AND DOG, a dark blur with teeth, extremely Doberman, flies toward Reese.  He spins.  Catches it by the throat in mid-air. Arcs it to the floor with unflinching precision. \nC.U. - DOBERMAN, suddenly on its back and held by the throat, THE DOG YELPS and stares at Reese, who leans very close. Inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis- ing dominance.  Some ancient communication seems to pass between the two. \nReese releases the animal and turns his back on it, selecting a long overcoat from a rack.  The dog backs away from him, stiff-legged and confused. \nCUT TO: \n14      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT                          14 \nTRACKING WITH REESE as he rounds a corner on the run, still shrugging into his long coat. Running smack at him is another cop, gun aimed. \nWithout slowing, Reese leaps toward him, twisting in mid-air like a cat.  The cop FIRES. Misses.  Goes down under Reese's tackle and they slide together on the polished floor. \nBefore they even come to rest Reese snatches the cop's gun, aiming it at the other's face two-handed. \nREESE What day is it?  The date... \nCOP Thursday...uh...May twelfth. \nREESE (viciously) What year? \nA SHOT whines off the metal side of an escalator behind Reese's head.  He vaults the escalator rail, leaving the amazed cop lying on the floor. \nReese bounds up the frozen steps, pocketing the .38 Police Special in his coat. \nCops dash through the maze of aisles, converging at the escalators. \nCUT TO: \n15      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT             15 \nWHIP PANNING WITH REESE, as he hurtles between displays. He stops for a moment beside a rack of shoes.  Slaps one of a pair of tennis shoes sole-to-sole against his bare foot. Too small.  Another.  Holding the shoes he runs on. \nCUT TO: \n16      EXT. SECOND FLOOR FIRE ESCAPE LANDING - NIGHT          16 \nA door opens quietly and Reese slips out. \nCAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he moves like a panther along the narrow catwalk.  TILT DOWN to include the first LAPD cruiser parked at the mouth of the alley. \nCUT TO: \n17      EXT. ALLEY/STREET - NIGHT                              17 \nReese drops cat-like beside the unattended police car. Cautiously, he opens the door of the cruiser, removes the RIOT GUN, an Ithaca pump model, from the dash rack and slips it under his coat.  Cradled in a vertical position, the shortened weapon is virtually invisible. \nHe walks out onto the street and away,  unhurriedly, an innocuous pedestrian soon lost in the rain. \nCUT TO: \n18      EXT. STREET/NEARBY - NIGHT                             18 \nReese enters a telephone booth.  Harsh light rakes across his face, outlining the long scar.  He opens the directory, leafs through it. \nANGLE - MACRO ON PAGE, Reese's finger slides down a column. Stops beside the following listings in the big metropolitan white pages: CONNOR, SARAH CONNOR, SARAH ANN CONNOR, SARAH J. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n19      EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING                             19 \nThe night's rain has given way to a typical L.A. morning of diffuse sunlight. \nMOVING WITH A GIRL on a MOPED as she zips through traffic. SARAH CONNER is 19, small and delicate-featured.  Pretty in a flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her.  Her vulner- able quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists. \nSarah maneuvers nimbly, apparently in a hurry. \nCUT TO: \n20      EXT. BIG BOB'S RESTRAUNT - DAY                         20 \nSarah buzzes into the parking lot of Big Bob's Family Restaurant and chains the moped to the icon of Big Bob himself.  The fiberglass cherub holds up his mammoth hamburger in perpetual homage to whatever deity watches out for fat kids. Sarah removes a stack of college textbooks from the luggage carrier and tuns to go into the restaurant. \nSARAH (to Big Bob) Watch this for me, big buns. \nCUT TO: \n21      INT. BIG BOB'S/DINING AREA                             21 \nHIGH WIDE SHOT prominently featuring a VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA F.G. as Sarah enters below.  She passes under another video eye as she crosses the main floor of the wholesomely appointed eatery.  Sarah goes through the swinging STAFF doors under a third camera. \nTIGHT ON GLASS COUNTERTOP as an AR-180 ASSAULT RIFLE WITH SCOPE is laid beside a number of other guns: a COLT K- MODEL .45 ACP, a SMITH AND WESSON .38 FOUR-INCH, a BERETTA .225 ACP. \nTERMINATOR (V.O.) ...the Remington 1100 Autoloader... \nWIDE as the CLERK, who looks like a sick lizard, pallid and paunchy, takes the rifle from a wall rack.  He lays it beside the arsenal of perfectly legal anti-human artillery already on the glass counter. Terminator scans expressionlessly for additional selec- tions. \nCLERK Anything else? \nTERMINATOR A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range... \nCLERK (annoyed) Just what you see, pal. \nHe indicates the display case and wall racks with a minimal gesture. \nTERMINATOR The Uzi 9 millimeter. \nCLERK (setting  it out) You know your weapons, buddy. \nTerminator examines each in turn, working the actions with curt, precise movements. \nCLERK (continuing) Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be? \nTERMINATOR All. \nThe clerk digs deep and finds a scrap of a smile. \nCLERK Maybe I'll close early. Cash or charge? \nInstead of replying, Terminator takes a box of shotgun shells from a stack on the display case. \nCLERK Sorry, I can't sell the ammo with the guns.  You'll have to---Hey! \nTerminator has calmly begun feeding the shells into the shotgun. \nCLERK (continuing) You can't to that... \nTERMINATOR (evenly) Wrong. \nHe raises the barrel and pulls the trigger.  The gun THUNDERS. \nCUT TO: \n30      EXT. GAS STATION/PHONE BOOTH - DAY                     30 \nThe yellow Maverick pulls to a stop beside a single phone booth. \nMOVING WITH TERMINATOR, as he gets out, walks to the booth and rapidly pulls its occupant out by his greasy T-shirt, flinging him backward into the parking lot.  The guy is bear-like, slab-handed, but Terminator doesn't even glance back as he steps in to take the man's place. \nMAN (outraged) Hey, man... \nCUT TO: \n31      PHONE BOOTH \nA woman's voice, a faint reedy monologue, issues from the dangling receiver. Terminator leafs rapidly through the directory. \nANGLE - C.U. PAGES FLIPPING \nANGLE - MACRO SHOT, as Terminator's finger comes to rest beside a now-familiar listing: CONNOR, SARAH \nCUT TO: \n32      INT. BIG BOB'S/DINING AREA \nSarah is bustling about, trying to service the start of the dinner rush.  In waitress parlance, she's 'in it'. She runs the gauntlet between tables, precariously balancing two full dinner plates on one arm and hand-carrying a third.  A customer tugs on her apron for attention and she barely averts contributing the chili size to his wardrobe. \nCUSTOMER Honey, can I get that coffee now? \nSARAH Yes sir, just a second. \nShe reaches her table after near collisions with a Mexican busboy and two teenage girls doing cheerleading routines in lock-step. \nSARAH Who gets the Burly Burger? \nCUSTOMER TWO I ordered Barbecue Beef. \nCUSTOMER THREE Does mine come with fires? \nCUSTOMER FOUR He's got the Barbecue Beef, I've got a Chili-Beef Deluxe. \nSARAH Okay, who gets the Burly Beef? \nCUSTOMER AT NEXT TABLE Miss, we're ready to order. \nIn the process of setting down all the plates Sarah knocks over someone's water glass. \nSARAH (mopping fran- tically) Oh, sorry.  That's not real leather, is it? \nAs she cleans up the spill, a kid at the next booth reaches over and dumps a scoop of ice cream into the top pouch of Sarah's apron \nShe stares down at the mess melting over her hard-earned and sags with defeat.  NANCY, a plump, gum-chewing waitress, stops beside her to whisper. \nNANCY Look at it this way: in a hundred years, who's gonna care? \nCUT TO: \n33      EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY \nCOUNTERMAN That'll be one-sixty. \nHe glances up and Reese is gone.  He leans half out the window. \nCOUNTERMAN (continuing) Hey!  Son-of-a-bitch. \nCUT TO: \n35      EXT. ALLEY - DAY                                       35 \nReese crouches in an alley, out of sight of passersby, wolfing his food.  The sauce runs down his sleeve but he doesn't notice. \nCUT TO: \n35A     INT. BIG BOB'S/DINING AREA - DAY                       35A \nAn old man with a shrunken, ungenerous face scowls at the menu as Sarah wipes the tabletop in front of him. \nSARAH I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller. \nMR. MILLER What's it to ya? \nSARAH You must have a girlfriend. \nMR. MILLER That's none of your business. \nSARAH Aha!  Is she young? \nMr. Miller lowers his menu and glares at her. \nMR. MILLER Compared to me she is.  How \ncome you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing? \nSARAH (smiling) What's it to ya? \nWhen she leaves, the old man is grinning, behind the menu, where no one can see him. \nCUT TO: \n36      INT. BIG BOB'S/SERVICE CORRIDOR                        36 \nSarah rounds the corner, walking fast as she undoes her apron.  She calls out to the walls without looking up. \nSARAH I'm on break, Chuck.  Carla's got my station. \nAs she approaches the locker room where the girls take their coffee breaks, the door bursts open and Nancy beckons to Sarah. \nNANCY (excitedly) Hurry up.  It's about you... I mean sort of...Come on! \nCUT TO: \n37      INT. BIG BOB'S/BREAK ROOM                              37 \nNancy guides Sarah to the small black and white portable TV in the corner.  Two other girls, smoking cigarettes with their shoes off and nyloned feet on the table, are already watching.  One glances at Sarah. \nWAITRESS Hey, Sarah.  This is weird. \nThey huddle around the set, intent on a newscast in progress. \nTV ANCHORWOMAN ...and a police spokesman at the scene refused to speculate on a motive for the execution- style slaying of the Encino housewife.  He did however say that an accurate description of the suspect has been compiled from several witnesses.  Once again, Sarah Connor, thirty-five, mother of two, brutally shot to death in her home this afternoon. \nAs the news grinds on, Sarah gazes unseeingly at the screen. Nancy claps her on the shoulder, laughing. \nNANCY You're dead, honey. \nCUT TO: \n38      EXT. HEALTH CLUB - DUSK                                38 \nSunlight is dying when Sarah swings her moped to the curb in front of the 'GOOD LIFE SPA', a large, crowded health club. \nCUT TO: \n39      INT. HEALTH CLUB/AEROBICS STUDIO                       39 \nMUSIC BOOMS and masses of leotarded cellulite sway in close F.G. as CAMERA DOLLIES along a row of panting, stretching women.  In deep B.G. Sarah slips in through the door and waits against the wall while the human dynamo, GINGER VENTURA, leads the class energetically.  Ginger, Sarah's roommate, is a party-stopper.  Red-haired, athletic, sensuous.  She's pretty enough when still, but stunning in motion.  And she's in motion. \nGinger yells commands and cheerfully dives into contortions to the BEAT of a MOTOWN FAVORITE. MARCO, a handsome, well-defined guy wearing a tight STAFF T-shirt, strolls up for a drink at the water fountain next to Sarah. \nMARCO Hi. I've seen you around. You're cute.  Cute I remember. \nSARAH I'm Sarah.  Ginger's roommate. \nMARCO Yeah, right.  I'm Marco. \nThe dance tape ends. \nGINGER ...and three aaand four!  And that's it ladies!  Now, didn't that feel good? \nThe group collapses ensemble.  A chorus of groans. \nGINGER Let's think positive or next time I'll play the FM version. \nGinger walks over to Sarah as the class disperses.  Marco is leaning on the wall next to Sarah, who is enjoying the attention. \nSARAH ...yeah, really?  Say some- thing in Italian. \nCUT TO: \n59      INT. LIVING ROOM \nSarah walks around the room, searching for something. \nSARAH (calling) Ginger, have you seen Pugsley? \nGinger enters, stopping beside their phone answering machine. \nGINGER Not lately.  Did you check messages? \nSARAH (still looking) I thought you did. \nShe checks under the couch, then behind the drapes.  She bends down. \nSARAH (from beside cur- tains) Come here young man.  Mind your mother. \nC.U. - PUGSLEY, as the GREEN IGUANA cocks its head, blinking vapidly. \nRESUME WIDE, Sarah lifts the three foot long lizard from his perch on the windowsill.  She gives the complacent reptile a kiss on its blunt snout. \nGINGER (groaning) Totally nauseating. \nSarah drapes the lizard across her shoulders where it sits contentedly as she looks for her purse.  Ginger has been rewinding the message tape.  She punches PLAY and a MALE VOICE is heard. \nVOICE (recorded) \nHi, Sarah...Stan Morsky. Uh, something's come up and it looks like I won't be able to make it tonight.  I'm really sorry.  Call you in a day or so. Sorry.  'Bye. \nSarah stands still, crestfallen. \nGINGER That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes. \nSARAH (slumping) \nI'll live. \nGINGER I'll break his kneecaps. \nSarah resignedly slips Pugsley off her shoulders. \nSARAH You still love me, don't you, Pugsley? \nShe places Pugsley in a large terrarium with a 'BEWARE OF DOG' sign taped on the side. \nSARAH (continuing) I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time. \nGINGER (as Sarah exits) We will, kiddo. \nCUT TO: \n60      INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT \nSarah is a small figure in the shadowed echoing garage of her building. \nCONVERGING DOLLY, PACING HER, as she passes the stalls with their inky shadows. The light near her moped is out. She fumbles in the dark to unlock the chain. She looks up. Did she hear something...masked by the rattle of the chain? \nPOV - SARAH, there is no movement for the length of the garage. \nON SARAH - C.U., inexplicably nervous. She stows the chain and starts the bike.  It whines reassuringly. Sarah jumps on and whirs out of the garage. \nCUT TO: \n61      INT. CAR/NEARBY - NIGHT                                61 \nSarah is visible through the windshield as she pulls onto the street. \nPAN WITH HER to reveal Kyle Reese, hunched down in shadow, watching.  He puts the car in gear and pulls out to follow her receding tail-light. Streetlights flash across his face, in stark-lines profile. Mouth cruel where the scar tugs at it. \nCUT TO: \n62      INT. DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT                     62 \nDOLLYING WITH VUKOVICH and TRAXLER, as they pass through a group of REPORTERS.  Mostly newspaper stringers but there is also one bored local TV MINICAM CREW. \nREPORTER ...Lieutenant, are you aware that these two killings occurred in the same order as their listings in the phone book? \nVUKOVICH No comment. \nHe and Traxler enter their office and shut the door. \nCUT TO: \n63      VUKOVICH'S OFFICE                                      63 \nVukovich drops his gun in the wastebasket, picks up a cup of coffee from his desk and uses it to wash down a handful of aspirins.  Traxler grimaces. \nTRAXLER That stuff's two hours cold. \nVUKOVICH (nodding ab- sently) I know. \nTRAXLER (eyeing him) I put a cigarette out in it. \nVukovich, lost in thought, turns on him suddenly. \nVUKOVICH Did you reach the next girl yet? \nCUT TO: \n70      INT. HALLWAY                                           70 \nSarah walks stiffly to the pay phone. It's OUT OF ORDER. \nCUT TO: \n71      EXT. STREET/SIDEWALK - NIGHT                           71 \nSarah exits the pizza place into the sparse crowd on the sidewalk.  As she passes a figure leaning against the wall just outside, the man turns his head to watch her. It is Reese, his gaze impassive. Streetlight catches the burn scar on his cheek. He is motionless, sinister in his long coat. Sarah shudders. She walks on. \nPOV - SARAH, ON CROWD, moving toward and through approaching groups of pedestrians.  They seem to be glancing at her. Was it always like that and she just never noticed? \nC.U. - SARAH as she look over her shoulder. \nPOV - SARAH, ON PIZZA PARLOR DOORWAY.  Reese is gone. She resists the urge to run. On the opposite side of the street an  LAPD cruiser glides slowly by.  Sarah is about to call out but a bus blocks her view and when it had passed, the car is turning away down a side street. \nShe passes a large window with STOKER'S written on it, and ducks quickly through the door. \nCUT TO: \n72      INT. STOKER'S - NIGHT                                  72 \nANGLE THROUGH WINDOW, SARAH F.G., as Reese approaches. Her knuckles clench white as he reaches the entrance and walks by, unhurriedly, without a glance inside. She turns and scan the gloomy interior, which reveals itself to be less than savory.  Pool tables and upper-middle lowlife in submarine depths of smoky haze. \nSarah draws stares, menacing in their own right, as she weaves between the pool tables to the back of the bar. her hands are trembling as she drops a dime in the pay phone and dials. \nVOICE (V.O./RECORDED) You have reached the Los Angeles Police Department Emergency Number. All lines are busy.  If you need a police car sent out to you, please stay on the line... \nSarah holds the receiver pressed to her ear, glancing around, fear feeding on frustration. \nCUT TO: \n73      EXT. SARAH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                73 \nAn LAPD black-and-white sits at the curb in front of Sarah's building with two cops inside, drinking coffee.  Through the open window we hear the dispatcher's voice on the radio. \nDISPATCHER (V.O.) ...two eleven in progress at Seven-Eleven market, Third and Tamarac.  One suspect believed to be armed... \nThe car pulls out with lights and siren on. A moment later, Terminator rounds the corner of the building and climbs the stairs to the entryway. He surveys the bank of call buttons, then turns to consider the barred security gate. \nCUT TO: \n74      INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                         74 \nPANAGLIDE WITH GINGER as she ties her terry-cloth robe and, leaving Matt in a dead sleep, pads through the dark apartment. Down the hall, past the phone with Traxler's message. Through the dark living room. She has her Walkman in the pocket of her robe and bops to herself in the silent gloom as she enters the kitchen. \nWhen she opens the refrigerator to remove snack fixings, the light briefly illuminates the kitchen and in that moment, SOMETHING MOVES in the F.G. \nTIGHT ON GINGER, MOVING WITH HER as she backs toward the counter with her arms full of snack stuff. \nA SUDDEN CRASH.  A flurry of motion behind her. She spins, dropping half her load. Ginger fumbles for the lightswitch. \nRevealing Pugsley, sitting there blinking innocently among overturned spice bottles on the counter-top. \nGINGER Shoo.  Go on.  I'll make a belt out of you. \nPugsley disappears into a large fern by the window and Ginger sets about her task, slathering crunchy peanut butter on stalks of celery. \nCUT TO: \n75      INT. BEDROOM                                           75 \nMEDIUM ON MATT, as rustling curtains play patterns of street- light over his sleeping face. The sound of a faint breeze. In the B.G. is the balcony, empty.  The sliding door is open. \nTIGHT ON MATT, as his eyes open at the sound of a quiet, repeated CLICKING. \nUP ANGLE - PAST MATT, as the five-inch blade of an industrial razor-knife reaches full extension in Terminator's hand, right above him. It slashes viciously downward. Matt rolls and the pillow is SLIT OPEN where his throat had been. \nMATT Whoah! \nTerminator catches him by the hair and slashed down again. Matt grabs the wrist in both hands. The enormous muscles of his arms, which seem capable of bench pressing a Chrysler, strain and knot against the pressure of the killer's single arm... And still the blade moves closer to his throat. \nWith a final heave Matt deflects the down-pressure sideways and the blade snaps with a CLINK against the headboard. \nHANDHELD WITH MATT as he rolls off the bed, spins and slams his fists together into Terminator's temple.  He picks up a brass deco lamp and brings it down with piledriver force. \nUnperturbed, Terminator knocks the lamp away and hurls Matt over the bed. \nCUT TO: \n76      EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT                                   76 \nMatt crashes through the glass doors and slams against the balcony railing. \nCUT TO: \n77      INT. KITCHEN                                           77 \nOblivious to the noise, Ginger croons in rock-and-roll ecstasy, singing to a celery stalk as if it were a micro- phone. \nCUT TO: \n78      EXT./INT. BALCONY AND BEDROOM - NIGHT                  78 \nMatt heaves himself up, powerful body gleaming with sweat and hurls himself upon the intruder. The titans CRASH INTO A DRESSER, reducing it to kindling. Then into the closet door, EXPLODING THE FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. \nSARAH (on phone) Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me. \nCUT TO: \n87      INT. VUKOVICH'S OFFICE - NIGHT                         87 \nVUKOVICH (on phone) Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes. \nHe hangs up and grabs his coat, motioning to Traxler. \nVUKOVICH Let's roll. \nCUT TO: \n88      INT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT                              88 \nSarah takes a seat at a booth near the bar, and picks up a dog-eared menu, but can't concentrate on it.  She looks at her watch and glances around. \nCUT TO: \n89      EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                    89 \nThe yellow Maverick hurtles along an empty street. \nCLOSER ANGLE as streetlight glare slashes across Terminator's face in flaring pulses. \nCUT TO: \n90      INT. PLAIN CAR - NIGHT                                 90 \nVukovich draws his Colt Python .357 Magnum and check the load.  Traxler is driving. \nVUKOVICH Let's see how this guy likes playing hard-ball. \nCUT TO: \n91      INT. STOKER'S BAR - NIGHT                              91 \nThe waitress set a cup of coffee in front of Sarah. \nWAITRESS Anything else? \nSarah shakes her head \"No\" and contemplates her trembling hands.  She half-turns, catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror behind the bar. \nTIGHT ON SARAH, reflected in the mirror.  In the F.G. a man at the bar looks up from his beer, straight into her eyes. It is Reese. He gazes at her coolly for a moment, then glances away. \nC.U. - SARAH, feeling trapped, frantic. \nANGLE ON FRONT DOOR as it opens and a figure stands silhou- etted briefly against a streetlight. \nReese turns, his eyes flickering to the mirror, the figure. \nC.U. - REESE as he mechanically raises his beer.  His knuckles are white.  He slowly undoes the top button of his overcoat. There is a glint of metal in the shadows within. Reese turns slowly on his barstool as the figure brushes past him, out-of-focus F.G. Sarah looks up. \nE.C.U. - REESE'S HAND sliding slowly along polished steel, a caress.  His finger slips through the triggerguard of the riot gun. \nMEDIUM ON SARAH, as the man stops in front of her in close F.G. He sits slowly in the booth opposite her.  The angle is OVER HIS SHOULDER. \nSARAH (uncertainly) Lieutenant Vukovich? \nREVERSE ANGLE - It is not Lt. Vukovich. Terminator sits motionless for a BEAT. Blue eyes so pure and deep.  The eyes of a saint, perhaps. \nThe .45 is out and cocked and AIMED DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, almost in one motion. The bore seems enormous. \nBACK ON SARAH, over the gun barrel, her eyes go wide.  We hold a BEAT, like a frozen slice of nightmare. \nMEDIUM ON REESE as he whips the riot-gun to a hip-firing posi- tion, his overcoat falling back with a snap.  HE FIRES. \nON TERMINATOR, as the shotgun blast hits his arm and he FIRES, simultaneously.  Sarah screams as the .45 round blows stuffing out of the booth seat inches from her face.  Her hair is singed by burning gunpowder.  An involuntary cry is punched out of her by the double concussions. \nReese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-rises from booth. \nOVER REESE'S SHOULDER, as he fires, cocks the slide, fires again, advancing on Sarah's booth. Terminator is blown backward over the center divider, crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the table opposite, and onto the floor. \nSarah is screaming, scrunched down in the booth. \nTerminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table- full of drunk patrons. He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one in the arm. \nThe bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau, cowering, gaping. Sarah stops screaming. Reese stand motionless, gun aimed. In the sudden silence, the sound of him cocking the shotgun is abnormally loud. \nON TERMINATOR, very still. Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the UZI machine pistol from beneath his overcoat, where it has been hang- ing on a shoulder strap. He doesn't seem too impaired as he swings around to fire. \nReese rolls like a cat and comes up firing. A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood. An orgy of shattering glass. Total pandemonium. \nSEVERAL ANGLES  as patrons of the bar run, scream or dive for cover, depending upon their level of intelligence. \nReese slides through the glass to Sarah's booth and seizes her wrists. \nON TERMINATOR, kneeling amid the chaos, raising the UZI one-handed. \nReese tugs viciously on Sarah's arm and she sprawls across the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion erupt with hits from the UZI. \nANGLE ON A RUNNING PATRON as a burst of 9mm fire catches him in the chest.  He pitches into Sarah's booth, pinning her. \nReese fires, ducks, fires again. Tables crash over. A window is blown out. A table candle rolls into a pool of high-proof alcohol behind the bar. It ignites with a WHOOSH. \nReese feed two shells into the riot-gun. \nVUKOVICH (continuing) Cover the alley in back. \nHe heads for the inferno at a run. \nCUT TO: \n104     EXT. ALLEY BEHIND STOKER'S - NIGHT                     104 \nDOLLYING WITH REESE AND SARAH as they run through the dark alley.  Sarah stumbles over trashcans. Reese pulls her along mercilessly. \nWHIP-PANNING as they clear a corner. The B.G. is a blur. The night-maze is a blur in all of these shots. No static angles. Relentless forward motion. \nCUT TO: \n105/FX  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                     105/FX \nBehind them Terminator is moving with inhuman speed, bounding like a panther, leaping trash cans and other obstacles. \nTRACKING C.U. - TERMINATOR, catching the faintest glimpse of a red glow in the pupils of his eyes as he passes through total shadow. \nCUT TO: \n106/FX  EXT. ALLEY/POV - TERMINATOR (HANDHELD) - NIGHT         106/FX \nWe know this is Terminator's POV because Sarah and Reese are just ahead of us.  But the image is bizarre, alien. Bright and hyper-real.  There is a hint of digitization, and the fleeing figures ahead are more luminous than the background, suggesting infra-red. The margins of the FRAME are crammed with columns of CRT- type characters: columns of numbers and acronyms.  The data changes more rapidly than any human eye could follow. There is no doubt that we are seeing as a machine would see. The sound effects are bright and clear, as if they are digitized and enhanced as well. \nCUT TO: \n107     EXT. ADJOINING ALLEY - NIGHT                           107 \nReese and Sarah turn a corner by caroming off the wall without slowing and pelt down a narrower alley.  This one is lined with a row of parked cars and connects to the street.  There is little room to run. Reese is reloading on the run, dropping shells. \nBehind them Terminator enters the alley, gaining. \nLOW ANGLE, FAST PANAGLIDE ahead of the fleeing pair. As they breast the last car Reese shoves Sarah hard, pitching her on her face to the pavement. He flings open the car door...a shield. Drops to the ground. Fires into the gas tank of a car further back in the row just before Terminator reaches it. \nThe car EXPLODES, filling the alley with fire.  An inferno funneled between the enclosing walls. \nANGLE ON REESE AND SARAH behind the car door as flames roar over the hood. \nON TERMINATOR, as he slides to a stop, cut off by the wall of flame. \nReese doesn't waste any time stuffing Sarah into the car. Climbing in after and over her he twists two wires together and we recognize it as his stolen GREY SEDAN. The engine catches. \nA SILHOUETTE rockets out of the flames. Terminator, leaping from the roof of the blazing car ahead, impacts on the hood of Reese's car.  His hair and coat are burning. \nCUT TO: \n108     INT./EXT. GREY SEDAN/ALLEY - NIGHT                     108 \nReese jams reverse and nail the throttle. The car backs down the alley. Terminator draws back his fist. Punches into the windshield. Inside, Sarah is sprayed with glass as the killer's fist shoots through. The lacerated fingers grope for her. \nWIDE as the car shoots backwards out of the alley onto the street, narrowly missing an arriving LAPD CRUISER. \nSarah plasters herself tightly into the seat as the fingers grasp her blouse and pull. Reese cranks the wheel hard. \nCUT TO: \n109     EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                    109 \nThe sedan skids, slewing sideways into a parked car. \nTerminator rolls down off onto the pavement. Reese's car shoots forward. \nPANNING WITH SEDAN as it roars past Vukovich, the gathering minions of the burning building, an arriving fire truck...shoots through a red light and continues to accel- erate. \nTerminator gets to a kneeling position, then slowly stands. He pats out his smoldering clothing as he watches his quarry escape. \nCUT TO: \n110     EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                    110 \nON VUKOVICH as he runs to his car, exhorting the nearby LAPD guys to give pursuit, while Traxler grabs the radio. \nVUKOVICH (shouting) Go!  Go!  He's got her. \nTRAXLER (overlapping) Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat... \nCUT TO: \n111     EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                    111 \nLOW WIDE ANGLE on the empty street, which is narrow and tightly lines with parked cars. The ROAR of an engine builds. The sedan, like a night-demon, hurtles out of the shadows with its lights off, doing ninety plus. \nCUT TO: \n112     INT. GREY SEDAN - NIGHT                                112 \nSarah is in a daze. Paralyzed.  Face bloodless. She is shivering silently, uncontrollably. Her eyes are wide, and it seems likely that she doesn't quite comprehend the roaring blur outside her window. \nREESE (calmly) Hold on. \nCUT TO: \n113     EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT                              113 \nWIDE ANGLE, CLOSE TO SEDAN, and following it as it hurtles around a corner in an expertly controlled slide. Then a high speed sprint down the cross-street. Reese squirrels the vehicle between a slow-moving car ahead and oncoming traffic. A dive into another dark side street. \nAt that moment a blinding light sears down on them from above.  Reese looks over his left shoulder and sees a CHP cruiser coming alongside. \nREESE Just a second.  Keep your head down. \nCUT TO: \n121     EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT                                   121 \nThe helicopter is right above the, its spotlight burning on Reese.  The cruiser flanks them, closing.  Reese peels off to the right, inches in front of a tractor-trailer rig, brakes hard and slides into a four-wheel drift through a curving off-ramp. The helicopter banks, following. The cruiser swaps ends trying to maneuver and slams broad- side into the guardrail.  Out of action. \nCUT TO: \n122     EXT. OFF RAMP/INTERSECTION - NIGHT                     122 \nThe sedan roars across the street without slowing and vanishes down a tree-lined side street. \nCUT TO: \n123     EXT.

SIDE STREET/INTERSECTION - NIGHT                   124 \nThe sedan skids around a corner, F.G., as the searchlight filters in shafts through the trees further down the street, sweeping futility back and forth. \nCUT TO: \n125     EXT. POLICE HELICOPTER - NIGHT                         125 \nIt hovers indecisively, then banks off. \nPILOT (V.O.) (filtered) Lost him. \nCUT TO: \n126     INT. GREY SEDAN - NIGHT                                126 \nReese is ultra-alert, craning to look up, back, forward. \nREESE Good cover. (pause) Alright.  Listen. The Terminator's an infil- tration unit.  Part man, part machine.  Underneath, it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, mircoprocessor-controlled, fully  armored. Very tough... \nHe pauses as they slide around another corner. \nCUT TO: \n127     EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                    127 \nReese's sedan glides out onto a main drag, very subdued. He turns the lights on and blends with traffic. The helicopter crosses laterally in the distance. \nCUT TO: \n128     INT. GREY SEDAN - NIGHT                                128 \nREESE (continuing) But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs. \nSARAH Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but... \nREESE (cutting her off) Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him. \nSARAH Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet. \nREESE No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years. \nReese is driving sedately for a low profile, but his eyes rove constantly, searching for a place to ditch the car. Sarah's eyes are alert as well, and her tone becomes a bit too cool. \nSARAH So, it's from the future, is that right? \nREESE One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff. \nSARAH And you're from the future too? \nREESE Right. \nThey come to a red light and Reese stops. \nSARAH (patronizingly) Right... \nLike a shot she unlatches the seatbelt, pulls the door lock and has the door half open before Reese can react.  He catches her arm and hauls her struggling back into the car. \nSarah sinks her teeth into his hand with all her strength. His grip doesn't slacken. Slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his other hand and shuts the door.  His face shows no reaction. \nSarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face.  The light turns green and Reese drives on. Sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth. \nREESE (coldly) Cyborgs don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't...do that...again. \nHe wipes his hand on his pants. \nSARAH (weakly, plead- ing) Just let me go. \nREESE (slow, but intense) Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead. \nSarah slump in utter resignation. \nSARAH (quietly) Can you stop it? \nREESE (continuing) ...but there was one man...who taught us to fight.  To storm the wire of the camps.  To smash those metal mother- fuckers into junk.  He turned it around...he brought us back from the brink. (pause) His name is Connor.  John Connor... your son, Sarah.  Your unborn son. \nSarah stared at him. \nCUT TO: \n137     EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                               137 \nThe brown Buick is F.G. as the nose of Terminator's cruiser appears behind it, moving slowly. \nC.U. - TERMINATOR, scanning. \nLOW ANGLE, past the back of the Buick, as Terminator cruises by.  The tailpipe, F.G., puffs quietly. Terminator's head snaps around. His eyes lock on Reese's car. He reaches for his shotgun. \nCUT TO: \n138     INT.

PARKING LOT - NIGHT                               141 \nReese and Terminator race along opposite sides of a row of cars, approaching the exit. The cruiser pulls ahead and closes diagonally as they clear the last car. Reese sees the other's shotgun leveled. He ducks, steering blind, keeps it floored. The windshield and side window EXPLODES INWARD. \nThe Buick slams into the black-and-white, spinning it into a parked truck.  TIRES SCREAM as the two cars slew around heading for the exit. \nSEVERAL ANGLES, as the police react. \nThe chopper banks tight and dives across the tops of the parked cars.  Cruisers race to converge. \nCUT TO: \n143     EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                    143 \nLOW WIDE ANGLE, PRECEDING REESE'S BUICK as it hits the street, accelerating.  Terminator's cruiser slides out behind it, fishtails, races forward. Engines roar as the cars go flat out.  Buildings lining the street become a blur. The chopper arcs in behind them. Legitimate police, lights blazing, enter the pursuit one by one. \nLOW ANGLE, MOVING WITH TERMINATOR'S CAR as Reese dodges across all lanes ahead of it. Terminator gaining. They run an intersection at a hundred plus. \nCUT TO: \n144     INT.

A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series \nSILBERMAN (gravely) I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion? \nREESE Yes. \nCUT TO: \n156     INT.

INTERROGATION ROOM \nREESE ...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it. \nSILBERMAN Then how are you supposed to get back? \nREESE Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me. \nCUT TO: \n158     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nE.C.U. - TERMINATOR, in profile, showing his lacerated eye. He is close to a mirror, practically touching it, staring intently. \nMACRO - X-ACTO KNIFE lying on the dresser.  Terminator's fingers lift it.  CAMERA TILTS TO FOLLOW as it rises to his face, holds TIGHT ON left eye. With a smooth motion the knife point enters the eyeball and cuts away the ruins sclera and cornea, as well as part of the damaged eyelids. \nHe wipes with a rag to clear the electronic eye's vision. Revealing the faintly glowing lens mechanism, suspended in a chrome socket by tiny servos. The eye whirs quietly as it tracks. \nSEQUENCE OF SHOTS, showing various repairs. Terminator's right hand, its wrist SUTURED crudely, holds a needle and sewing thread and starts to work on abdominal wound out of frame below. He slips a glove over the damaged hand. A motoring cap over the blistered scalp. \nA fresh shirt to hide his body wounds. This is followed by a new overcoat. \nC.U. - TERMINATOR, contemplating his reflection in the mirror.  With the hat pulled down, the collar pulled up, and favoring his right profile he looks unhurt...though a bit gaunt and pale. \nA turn of his head brings the balefully glowing left eye in its metal socket into view. He slips on a pair of tight, wrap-around sunglasses. \nFULL SHOT as he goes to the bed and flips up the stained mattress.  He picks up the Remington 12 gauge, the AR-180 and the .38 off the springs and leaves by the fire escape. \nCUT TO: \n159     INT. VUKOVICH'S OFFICE - NIGHT                         159 \nTIGHT ON VIDEO MONITOR showing Reese in the Interrogation Room. \nREESE (recorded) ...It's just him and me. \nCUT WIDE revealing Sarah, Silberman, Vukovich and Traxler watching a monitor sitting amid incredible paperwork clutter on a desk top. \nSILBERMAN (recorded) Why didn't you bring any weapons?  Something more advanced.  Don't you have ray guns? \nTraxler, standing in the back, grins and nudges Silberman, who nods appreciatively. \nTIGHT ON REESE'S RECORDED IMAGE - He glares at Silberman. \nON SARAH, as Silberman's voice is heard. \nSILBERMAN (recorded) Show me a piece of future technology. \nREESE (recorded/con- trolling his hostility) You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go. \nSILBERMAN (recorded) Why? \nREESE (recorded) I didn't build the fucking thing. \nSILBERMAN (recorded) Okay.  Okay.  But this... (consults his notes) cyborg...if it's metal... \nREESE (recorded) Surrounded by living tissue. \nSILBERMAN (recorded) Of course. \nThe real Silberman put the tape on \"PAUSE\". \nSILBERMAN (excited) This is great stuff.  I could make a career out of this guy. You see how clever this part is...how it doesn't require a shred of proof.  Most paranoid delusions are intricate...but this is brilliant. \nHe starts the tape again. \nSILBERMAN (recorded) Why were the other two women killed? \nREESE (recorded) Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic. \nC.U. - REESE, ON SCREEN, as he goes on. \nREESE (recorded, con- tinuing) You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me? \nSILBERMAN (recorded) I'm afraid that's not up to me. \nREESE (recorded/voice rising) Then why am I talking to you? Get out. \nThrough the hole in the splintered wall we see Terminator leap out of the car. He vaults the hood and smashes through the debris of the wall. Leaps to the corridor floor in a shower of plaster fragments. He brandishes the AR-180 like a pistol in one hand, the .38 in the other. The shotgun dangles at his side on a shoulder sling. \nLOW ANGLE DOLLY, preceding him as he starts down the corridor. \nANGLE ON LOUNGE DOORWAY as TWO COPS run into the hall, one carrying a cup of coffee.

Leaving her alone. She flinches as more SHOTS SOUND.  CLOSER. \nCUT TO: \n167A    INT. CORRIDOR                                          167A \nTerminator rips the cover off the station's main electrical panel.  He pulls loose the hose-like 440 volt incoming line and feeds it directly into the lighting circuit. \nAll down the corridor the overhead fluorescent units explode, showering sparks and glass. \nThe building is plunged into darkness. \nArcs SPUTTER and FLARE, lighting the corridors strobo- scopically. \nCUT TO: \n167B    INT. VUKOVICH'S OFFICE                                 167B \nSarah's terror skyrockets when the ceiling lamp explodes and the office goes black. \nCUT TO: \n168     INT. CORRIDOR                                          168 \nThrough the smoke and emergency spotlights Terminator moves forward, inexorably. A door behind him opens.  A COP fires, hitting him in the shoulder.  Terminator fires straight-arm with the .38 without slowing, killing the cop, then fires down the corridor with the assault rifle. \nCUT TO: \n169     INT.

VUKOVICH'S OFFICE                                 172 \nANGLE LOOKING OUT from the mouth of an enclosed concrete storm drain that passes under the road.  Reese, followed by Sarah, trudges down the slope and ducks inside. The floor is wet but he doesn't seem to mind. They both hunker down with their backs to the concrete, facing each other. They look beaten, grimy, exhausted. She huddles under the blanket, waif-like. \nREESE You cold? \nSARAH Freezing. \nREESE Come here. \nShe sits beside him and they wrap their arms around each other with the blanket covering both of them. \nSARAH Reese...you got a first name? \nREESE Kyle. \nSARAH Kyle, what's it like when you go through time? \nREESE White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe. \nSarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket. \nSARAH You're wet.  Oh my god. \nIn the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening with blood. \nREESE I caught one, back there. \nSARAH (incredulous) Caught one?  You mean you got shot? \nReese shrugs. \nREESE It's not bad. \nSarah sits up and turns toward him. \nSARAH We gotta get you to a doctor. \nREESE It's okay.  Forget it. \nSARAH Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it. \nSarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder. \nSARAH (continuing) Jeez.  You idiot.  Take this off. \nShe cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens the first aid kit as he removes his jacket. \nREESE (looking at the wound) See.  Missed everything. Passed through the meat. \nSarah starts swabbing the flesh wound. \nSARAH This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something. \nREESE What? \nSARAH Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall? \nShe places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it. \nREESE About my height.  He has your-- (winces) ...damn...he has your eyes. \nSarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back to work. \nSARAH What's he like? \nREESE (thoughtful) You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John. \nSARAH Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him. \nREESE John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war... \nSARAH (interrupting) Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here? \nREESE I volunteered. \nSARAH You volunteered? \nREESE It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war. \nShe stops taping.  She seems lost, her bravado dissipated. \nSARAH You talk about things I haven't done yet in the past tense.  It's making me crazy.  I can't think. (pause) Are you sure you've got the right person? \nReese appraises her coldly. \nREESE I'm sure. \nSARAH Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats. \nShe pulls the bandage tight with a knot. \nREESE Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight. \nSARAH And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare? \nREESE You'll learn. \nSARAH (angry) Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it. \nREESE (a whisper) I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this... \nHe gestures at their surroundings. \nREESE (continuing) It's...like some dream. This...this... \nHe touches the grass, the trunk of a tree. \nREESE (continuing) ...and you...all so...beauti- ful.  It hurts, Sarah.  More than death. \nHe looks are her beseechingly. \nREESE (continuing) Don't you understand...it's all gone! \nSarah puts her arm around him. She sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand. \nSARAH We can change it, Kyle.  We have to try. \nShe takes his shoulder in her hands. \nSARAH (continuing) There's no fate but what we make for ourselves. Right? Come on.  Let's go, kiddo. Whaddya say? \nHe picks up her sign and they look at each other for a second, then get up. \nCUT TO: \n194     INT.

The driver answers her wave out the side window.  Reese stops for a moment outside the motel office to pet a GERMAN SHEPHERD sitting on the porch. The dog wags its tail and licks his hand. \nReese opens the door and they go in. \nCUT TO: \n201     INT.

Ahead lies a LONG, SWEEPING CURVE, two lanes wide and elevated. \nTerminator rocks back from a round between the eyes that bares metal, the FIRES. \nBullets rake the pickup.

TEARS THROUGH THE DIVIDING FENCE. Heads back toward her on the wrong side of the freeway. \nShe stares in numb horror. The nightmare refuses to end. She runs to the crippled pickup and sees a front tire flat, shredded by a crumpled fender. \nShe searches the cab frantically for the KEYS TO THE MOTORCYCLES.  Finds them above the sun visor. \nSarah leaps into the bed of the pickup and attacks the motorcycle strap-downs frantically. Panting with terror she rolls the bike off the truck. It crashes on its side and she falls on it painfully. \nStraining until she CRIES OUT INVOLUNTARILY, she lifts it upright. KICKS the engine over. \nLOW ANGLE \nas the tanker crashes back through the divider and starts UP THE OVERPASS.  Sarah is trapped in that concrete corridor. She kicks for her life. The bike catches for a moment.  Dies. \nThe truck BELLOWS, down-shifting on the curving grade. Sarah kicks again and again, crying out with each stroke. Again and again, furiously. The engine CATCHES. \nSARAH (rapidly) Come on, come on, come on ...run, you... \nThe bike runs with a healthy roar. \nLOW ANGLE \nup the face of the tractor-trailer, the retaining wall blur- ring by.

The truck roars past, hitting the air-brakes. The trailers force her closer and closer  to the guardrail as Terminator tries to sandwich her. The bike slides to a stop. The rearmost set of trailer wheels slams into the guardrail right in front of Sarah. \nSarah emerges from a cloud of tire smoke, cutting across all four lances behind the stopped semi. \nCUT TO: \n243     EXT.

The Terminator hits the door from the far side. Hinges SQUEAL. \nKyle goes to a LARGE BREAKER PANEL and opens it.  Starts throwing switches.  Behind them, machines START UP ONE BY ONE. \nSARAH (panting) What are you doing? \nREESE (weakly) Cover...our footsteps... \nHe sags, sliding down the wall.  She pulls him up. Half-carries him into the maze of machines. The dark gallery is filled with WHIRRING, CLANKING SHAPES, SHATTERING CONVEYER BELTS and improbable mechanisms lashing mindlessly. \nReese slips to the floor and Sarah is no longer able to support him. \nREESE (faintly) Leave me here. \nSarah crouches beside him. Grabs his shirt front. Yells over the machines. \nSARAH I'm not leaving you anywhere you jerk.  Haven't you figured it out?  Kyle, John is our son. \nReese's eyes refocus. \nSARAH (continuing) There isn't going to be anybody else...I don't want anybody else.  Listen to me! \nShe pauses, then resumes in a commanding, military shout. \nSARAH (continuing) Move!  Reese! Let's go. Move you ass! \nShe drags him to his feet and he staggers on. \nHinges SHATTER and the firedoor is hurled inward. The Terminator scans the darkness. \nANGLE - PANNING WITH SARAH AND KYLE as they move through the machines. \nThe cyborg steps forward, scanning methodically. \nSarah and Kyle move in a crouch through the treacherous tangle of pipes and machinery.  Kyle picks up a length of pipe to use as a weapon.  As they climb out onto a cat- walk between the two huge mechanisms, Sarah clambers over an innocuous CONTROL PANEL. Her knee inadvertently hits a RED PUSH BUTTON. With a ROAR the stamping-plate of a HYDRAULIC PRESS slams down an inch from her hand. Startled, she tumbles to the catwalk. \nThe Terminator's eyes swivel as he hears the single non- rhythmic sound. \nKyle and Sarah run to the end of the catwalk, but find the door there locked. \nSARAH Come on! \nThey double back to escape the cul-de-sac.  The Terminator steps in front of them, cutting them off. \nREESE (shouting) Run! \nHe pushes Sarah roughly and she stumbles away. Kyle raises the pipe with his good arm as the Terminator advances. \nREESE (over his shoulder) Run, damn it! \nShe hesitates, backing away. The cyborg swings at Reese STEEL CLANGS ON STEEL. Kyle strikes and parries but is sledgehammered back. \nANGLE ON CATWALK as Kyle lands in a heap, smashed against a stanchion of the railing which prevented him falling to the factory floor twenty feet below. \nSarah turns and runs. \nLOW ANGLE PAST REESE, F.G., as the cyborg approaches him. \nE.C.U. - A FUSE BURNING. \nC.U. - KYLE'S FACE streaked with blood, pressed to the floor as a metal foot CLANGS DOWN, F.G.   His eyes snap open. \nSarah falls, gets up, runs on. The Terminator draws back for a death blow. And Kyle rolls with the last of his strength, raising the pipe bomb he has been cradling.  He jams it between two hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborg's armored  rib- cage.  Then rolls off the catwalk.  Terminator has an instant to react, reaching for the bomb, before it EXPLODES. \nSarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the floor. Slams up against one wall. A withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around her. Pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory, rain- ing down. \nC.U. - SARAH, very still.  She winces and opens her eyes. Slowly looks up. \nPOV - SARAH, as the smoke clears.  The Terminator is GONE. Unrecognizable clumps of BURNING DEBRIS lie scattered about. Looking down through the grating floor she sees Kyle's body. LOW ANGLE ON KYLE F.G., Sarah on catwalk above.  Kyle's eyes are half-open.  Still.  His face peaceful. ANGLE ON ONE OF THE FIRES climbing some plastic tubing and triggering a SPRINKLER HEAD.  It begins to rain. C.U. - SARAH sitting up as the water runs over her. She looks down.  Protruding from her right thigh is a TWISTED PIECE OF METAL.  Shrapnel.  Part of the cyborg.  She pulls it out, grimacing.  Her leg is broken. \nIt is a long time before she can gather the will to move. \nSARAH'S POV - She sees a WALL PHONE several yards away, beyond the debris from the explosion. She starts to crawl toward it.

DOLLYING as they start to belly crawl through the bones and wreckage. Reese looks up. Through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying SPHINX-LIKE SHAPE moves against the sky...obscured by dust and blinding sweeps of its searchlights. Though we see little, this is an H-K,Hunter-Killer mobile ground-unit. \nReese crawls, pacing the H-K, under and through, on elbows and knees, past mounds of charred skulls.  They pass the BODY OF A CHILD, a boy of about 10, center- punched with a smoking hole.  The boy clutches a rifle. More bodies.  Some in rags, some in uniforms like theirs. WOMEN. OLD MEN. CHILDREN.  They're all dirty and gaunt, scabrous.  And still bleeding.  Reese scrabbles past a dark rat-hole and there are human rats in it.  Some of them are sobbing, or screaming. \nAnother EXPLOSION. The GLARE lights the huddled few. Human vermin with mud-caked weapons that haven't been invented yet.  Soldiers in a nightmare war. \nReese and his teammate stop behind a blasted wall, having outflanked the massive H-K.  Its flashing blue lights flick across the walls, its searchlights sear through the debris. \nWIDER, showing the H-K more clearly...a blast-scarred CHROME LEVIATHON, with hydraulic arms folded mantis-like against its 'torso', and huge underslung GUN TURRETS. \nReese leaps up and straight-arms a satchel-charge into its path.  One tread rolls over the explosive. Guns and searchlights swivel.  The head turns ponderously. Reese's partner rises, poised to throw hers. A POWER-BOLT catches her at the top of her arc, BLOWING HER INTO RED MIST. \nReese is knocked down by the concussion.  Gets up, running, as the charges blow. The H-K's tread carriers are RIPPED APART. It lurches to a stop, burning. \nThe following SEQUENCE is extremely FORESHORTENED. CUT FAST.  IMPRESSIONS ONLY. Running. Explosions light the ruins like flashbulbs. ENERGY WEAPONS criss-cross the night like tracers. LOW ANGLE, up past the burning H-K as its flying counter- part, an AERIAL H-K, arcs into view with a TURBOJET WHINE. \nReese hauls two survivors of his unit into a PERSONNEL CARRIER, a CHEVY CAMARO with steel plate welded over it and the roof cut away to access the 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN. It's stripped and rusted and bullet-riddled, glassless. The TIRES are OFF-ROAD and very gnarly. \nThey're driving through the ruins, up and over and through. Reese drives like a demon.  Under other circumstances it would be considered insane.  Here it is merely very good. \nThe machine gun CHATTERS. A BLACK SHAPE descends, a demon with searchlights. A BOLT OF LIGHT. \nReese's car flips like a kicked beer can, rolling and crumpling.  He's pinned in the wreck, bloody, screaming despite his training.  The only other survivor, an emaciated BOY of twelve, is pulling for all he's worth to drag Reese out before it burns. \nCUT TO: \n47      EXT.

GREY SEDAN                                        48 \nReese's eyes open in a split-second, and suddenly there is a SHOTGUN MUZZLE AIMED RIGHT AT US. Reese quivers with a curious spasm, similar to the tremors of his arrival, and blinks at the boy. \nThe boy is white-faced, staring down the bore.  He backs away.  We see that he is straddling a bicycle. \nCUT TO: \n49      EXT.

He slips the safety to the OFF position. The gun can now be fired. \nHe sets it on the seat and reaches for the dangling ignition wires, starting the car. \nCUT TO: \n51      EXT.

SARAH'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT    53 \nSarah and Ginger are crammed into the tiny bathroom, becoming inextricably tangled in each other's cords as they blow-dry, curl hair, and apply make-up.  Ginger has her headphones inverted under her chin but in place, and is bouncing to music as she dries her hair.  She is wearing a short terry-cloth bathrobe that reveals the greater part of her legs.  Sarah is in a skirt and bra. \nThe phone rings and Sarah goes out into the living room to get it. \nSARAH (answering the phone) Hello? \nVOICE (V.O.) (on phone, deep and breathy) First I'm going to rip the buttons off your blouse, one by one...then run my tongue along your neck, down to your bare, gleaming breasts... \nSarah cups her hand over the mouthpiece and calls out matter-of-factly: \nSARAH Ginger!  It's Matt. \nShe resumes listening. \nMATT (V.O.) ...and then slowly pull your jeans off inch by inch and lick your belly in circles, further and further down... then I'll pull off your panties with my teeth... \nSarah is repressing laughter. \nSARAH (crossly) Who is this? \nSilence.  Then Matt realizes to his horror who he's been talking to. \nMATT (V.O.) Oh my God!  Sarah!  Oh, shit. Jesus, I'm sorry.  I thought you were...Can I talk to Ginger? \n", "test1_true": "As Ginger approaches, Sarah hands her the receiver and goes into the bedroom. \nGINGER Hello? \nMATT (V.O.)

LIVING ROOM \nGinger is still listening to Matt, nodding, as Sarah enters and starts holding the blouses against herself one by one for Ginger's inspection. \nSARAH What do you think? \nGINGER (covering mouth- piece) Great. \nSarah hold up another one. \nSARAH How about this? \nGINGER Great. \nSARAH You're a big help. \nGINGER (advisory tone) Alright, the beige one. \nSARAH I hate the beige one. \nGINGER (same advisory tone) Don't wear the beige one. \nSarah gathers up the blouses and walks out. \nSARAH (V.O.) This guy's probably a schmuck and I don't care what I wear. \nA couple of BEATS, and she's back in the doorway with a concerned expression. \nSARAH (continuing) You think the beige? \nCUT TO: \n56      EXT. VENICE STREET - NIGHT \nAn unmarked car with a clamp-on light and siren blaring screeches to the curb behind two marked black-and-whites in front of a funky Venice apartment building.  A small crowd  is gathered around the front steps.  LIEUTENANT ED VUKOVICH, Homicide Division, gets out of the car and strides through the crowd.  He's fiftyish, short, but square and solid, a human bulldog gone a little to paunch. He chews Juicy Fruit gum like a maniac: a chain-chewer. He's homely as an old boot.  And he's not a smart cop, he's a wise one; rarer still.  The onlookers, gathered patiently for their ten second glimpse of something under a sheet, separate for him to pass. \nCUT TO: \n57      INT. VENICE APARTMENT BUILDING/STAIRWELL/APARTMENT \nCAMERA PANAGLIDES AHEAD OF VUKOVICH, as he climbs the switch- back staircase two steps at a time.  He passes TWO UNIFORMED COPS at the doorway of a second-floor apartment, and enters to find a quiet flurry of activity.  Several DETECTIVES and a PHOTOGRAPHER prowl around, taking evidence, taking pictures. \nIn the center of the living room floor is the body of a young woman, crumpled face down in a small lake of blood. Two bags of groceries lie split open on the floor in front of her. \nVukovich glances up as he is joined by DETECTIVE SGT. TRAXLER.  Traxler is black, lean and very jaded. \nVUKOVICH Give me the short version. \nTRAXLER Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber-- \nVukovich is looking at the body. \nVUKOVICH No shit. \nTraxler turns to a passing DETECTIVE. \nTRAXLER Come on. man.  Don't track it all over.  It's un- professional. \nHe turn back to Vukovich, gesturing at the body. \nTRAXLER (continuing) Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal-- \nVUKOVICH (interrupting) That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon. \nTraxler slips something off his clipboard and hands it to the Lieutenant. \nTRAXLER Here's her driver's license. \nVUKOVICH (pondering) You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer. \nTRAXLER I hate the weird ones. \nCUT TO: \n58      INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM                        58 \nSarah poses with Ginger in front of the mirror.  They are dressed, made-up, hair-styled and READY. \nGINGER (studying their reflection) Better than mortal man deserves. \nSarah grins and goes into the other room. \n", "test2_input": "SARAH I was dreaming about dogs. \nReese extricates himself from her and steps out of the culvert. \nREESE We used them to spot Terminators. \nSarah groans as she straightens her legs. \nSARAH Your world...it's pretty terrifying. \nCUT TO: \n189     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN                                    189 \nSarah catches up to him just as he is about to try and stop an approaching car.  She pulls his gun hand down with both of hers. \nSARAH Put that away.  I'll get one. \nShe hold out her thumb to passing traffic.

HIGHWAY/PICKUP - DAY                              189A \nReese and Sarah are crammed into the cab of a beat-to-hell PICKUP TRUCK with the DRIVER, obviously a surfer.  Laid- back, long-haired and well-tanned. Reese glowers and watches the scenery through slitted eyes. \nDRIVER ...and when it breaks right off the point they get some pretty rad tubes up there. Not awesome, but I mean, worth the drive, if you're hardcore like me. \nREESE (to Sarah) Rad tubes? \nSARAH (to Reese) He's a surfer. \nDRIVER You from back East of something? \nSARAH No, he's from the future. \nDRIVER Whoah.  I hear that. (pause) Listen, I had a rough night.  I gotta stop and bag some Z's. \nThey pull off the highway toward a gas station/rest area. \nCUT TO: \n190     EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY                             190 \nThe gas station is like an oasis of clutter in a rolling stretch of meadows and woods.  It consists of a bunker- like building with restrooms and a flanking PICNIC AREA, beyond which are WOODS. People sit under the trees, enjoying the beautiful day while children tear around after the forced inactivity of a long trip. \nThe three of them get out on unsteady legs. \nDRIVER You can still ride if you wanna hang out for a couple hours. \nSARAH Thanks. \nREESE Bag some Z's? \nSARAH Let's get cleaned up, Kyle. \nShe heads for the WOMEN'S RESTROOM and Kyle follows her inside. \nREESE (pushing him out) Yours is over there. \nInstead of following her directions to the Men's Room, Kyle wanders toward the drinking fountain.  A bunch of kids are running around and throwing water at each other with paper cups. \nReese shambles through them like a zombie. He stands among the children, an alien in this land without fear.  He watches people at picnic tables laughing and listening to portable music.  Kids squeal.  Dogs bark. \nLITTLE GIRL (V.O.) Can you get my balloon? \nDOWN ANGLE on an achingly beautiful LITTLE GIRL of about four.  She points above his head. \nReese looks up to see a helium-filled mylar balloon stuck in the foliage of a tree just above him.  He pulls it down by the string and holds it, turning it over dully. \nHe crouches down to her eye-level.  She smiles. \nREESE Aren't you afraid to be out in the open like this? \nLITTLE GIRL Huh? \nReese whirls reflexively at a SCREAM behind him.  The mylar balloon bursts in his tense hands.  A teenage girl is being doused with water by the boys with plastic jugs. \nThe little girl looks at the broken balloon, then glares at Reese.  She punches him soundly on the shoulder and storms off. \nAt this moment she is bowled over by an IRISH SETTER that licks her face while she shrieks with laughter. Reese seems about to smile but doesn't quite know how to go about it. \nCUT TO: \n191     EXT. SERVICE STATION/PAY PHONE - DAY                   191 \nSarah is talking on an open pay phone. \nSARAH ...I know, Mom.  This is the soonest I could...I know. Mom...Mom, I can't talk long. No, I'm okay. (pause) I was on TV?  Really? (pause) Oh no, I hate that picture... why didn't you give them my graduation picture? (pause) I'm okay, really.  Listen, I want you to pack some stuff and go up to the cabin for a few days.  Just don't...no, don't ask any questions. Just do it.  I gotta get going...gotta go.  Bye, bye. \nSarah has been idly leafing through the DIRECTORY.  On a whim she looks up something. She freezes for a moment when she finds the listing. Then with a triumphant expression she rips the page out of the book. CUT TO: \n192     EXT.

What's that? \nSarah looks up, startled to see him standing beside her. \nSARAH That's where we're going. \nREESE Why? \nSarah point to the directory page lying on the table. \nMACRO - PAGE \nSarah's finger points to a listing which reads: \nCYBER DYNAMICS CORPORATION 18144 El Camino Real, S'Vale \nANGLE ON SARAH AND REESE \nShe looks smug. \nSARAH Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation? \nREESE What about it? \nSARAH Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing... \nREESE Molecular-memory. \nSARAH Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right? \nREESE (uneasy) That's the way it was told to me. \nSarah's fear has been replaced by excitement. \nSARAH Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something. \nREESE (very cold) Tactically dangerous.  We lay low. \nSARAH Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves. \nREESE That's not my mission. \nSARAH (upset, mocking his manner) Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me. \nReese takes her arm and pulls her to her feet. \nREESE Let's go.  Time to move out. \nSARAH Fuck you!  Let go of me! \nShe jerks her arm free.  He reaches for her again but she outdistances him, running. \nREESE (warning tone) Sarah! \nShe dashes down a footpath among the trees, clutching her sign.  Reese follows her into the woods. \nCUT TO: \n193     EXT.

Reese tackles her from behind and they fall together in the long spring grass. She struggles violently to get away. \nSARAH Let...go...bastard... \nShe gets one arm free and whacks him hard in the face. Reese reacts instinctively, leaping back in a defensive crouch.  Sarah freezes when she sees the .357 in his hand. \nSARAH (continuing, scared, but angry) Oh, that's real smart. Go on, shoot me. That's brilliant. \nReese is trembling as he lowers the gun. Sarah too is shaking with emotion.  Tears roll down her cheeks and her voice cracks. \nSARAH (continuing) Jesus Christ, Reese.  Can't you see I'm scared? \nHe straightens up and his arms go limp at his sides. He turns away. \nSARAH (continuing) I can't spend my life waiting for that thing to catch up with me...always looking over my shoulder, wondering if I left some tiny clue behind... \nReese doesn't respond. The gun slips from his fingers. His will seems to drain from him and he sags to his knees. The moment stretches. There is only the sunlight moving in shafts through the leaves, the sound of a small stream nearby, birds chirping. \nSARAH Reese? \nShe crawls over to him. \nC.U. - REESE \nin profile, with Sarah in B.G. His eyes are closed. A tear meanders down his cheek. \nSARAH (continuing, quietly) Kyle? \n", "test3_input": "There are also boxes of shotgun shells, road flares, tape, scissors, pans, a strainer and many other odd utensils, substances, chemicals. \nSARAH What's that? \nREESE Nitroglycerin, basically.

Sarah and Kyle have pulled the dresser out to use as a worktable.  Pans, packages and bottles clutter the kitchen, B.G.  On the table between them are eight ten-inch lengths of PLUMBER'S PIPE, threaded each end.  Kyle is showing Sarah how to tamp the HIGH-EXPLOSIVE PUTTY into the pipe bombs and seal them shut. \nREESE Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently. \nSARAH You must have had a fun child- hood. \nREESE That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses. \nSARAH I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs... \nREESE Hot dogs? \nSARAH I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you. \nREESE My whole life has been combat. \nSARAH I want it to be over for you. \nREESE Not possible. \nSARAH I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us. \nReese looks up and finally catches her gaze.  He reaches out for her hand and it seems he may be taking it to comfort her. But he turns her wrist to read her watch. \nREESE We'll head out at 0200. That gives you four hours to sleep if you want.  I'll finish. \nCUT TO: \n211     INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                211 \nANGLE ON TABLE - The bombs are neatly ranked, finished. A nylon satchel lies nearby.  The mess is cleaned up. \nWIDE SHOT reveals Reese sitting in silent vigil at the window.  The room is dark, lit only by a streetlight outside. Sarah is asleep on the bed. \nReese sits cross-legged, shirtless, his body held rigid. The image of discipline.  The .357 is held loosely in one hand on his lap.  There is a fresh bandage on his shoulder. \nSarah wakes up and goes to him in the darkness.  He looks at her for a moment as she sits beside him, then back outside. \nSARAH He'll find us, won't he? \nREESE Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed... \nSARAH Don't say that. \nREESE If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one. \nSARAH It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed. \nREESE No.  I'm not. \nSeveral beats before Sarah speaks again.  Her eyes seem luminous in the dark. \nSARAH (softly) Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like? \nREESE Good fighters. \nSARAH That's not what I meant. Was there someone special? \nREESE Someone? \nSARAH A girl.  You know. \nREESE (mechanically) No. (pause) Never. \nHe looks away, outside the window \nSARAH (softly) I'm sorry. \nSarah studies him for a moment. She's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars with her fingertips. \nSARAH So much pain. \nREESE Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it. \nSARAH And so you feel nothing. \nREESE It's better that way. \nSARAH (with great sympathy) Oh, Kyle. \n", "test3_true": "REESE John Connor gave me a picture of you once.  I never knew why.  It was very old. Torn. Faded.  You were young, like you are now.  You weren't smiling...just a little sad... I always wondered what you were thinking at that second. \nHe closes his eyes, reaches toward her.  His fingertips trace the contour of her nose, chin, cheeks. \nREESE (continuing) I memorized every line, every curve... \nHe opens his eyes, looking right at hers. \nREESE (continuing) Sarah, I came across time for you.  I love you. I always have. \nSarah is quietly overwhelmed. Reese looks away. \nREESE (continuing) I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said... \nSARAH Kyle... \nShe leans forward and kisses him. His face is frozen.  A mask. She continues, tenderly. He begins to respond. The dam breaks and he holds her in a tight, trembling embrace, clinging to her like life itself. \nKyle picks her up and carries her to the bed. She kisses his neck and chest, tracing his scars with her lips. \nHe unbuttons her blouse very slowly. Sarah guides his powerful hands over her. \nA SEQUENCE OF CUTS.  DETAILS.  IMPRESSIONS. \nSarah, a very close angle, as she grimaces in divine agony. Reese, his face rapt. His hand, clutching the pillow as if to kill it. It is explosive, torrential.

Lying across his chest, she surveys his face as his eyes close drowsily. \nSARAH I bet you're ticklish. \nREESE (uncompre- hending) Ticklish? \nSarah's hand moves OUT OF FRAME.  After a moment Reese looks down, puzzled. \nREESE What are you doing? \nSARAH (continuing doggedly) You'll beg for mercy in a second. \nReese seems unperturbed.  Finally he begins to squirm. \nREESE I don't think I like this. \nSARAH You're not supposed to. \nNow Reese is becoming desperate.  A grimace spreads across his face.  It becomes a grin.  Then he's laughing, trying to escape but she won't let him, and they collapse, laughing together. Sarah gazes at his grin, a glimpse of the Reese that might have been, in another life. \nA moment later the grin vanishes at the sound of dogs barking outside. Reese is off the bed in an instant, crouched tense, eyes alert.  Feral as ever. \nREESE (whispering) Listen to the dogs. \nCUT TO: \n213     EXT.

The nearest vehicle parked in front is a LARGE PICKUP TRUCK WITH TWO DIRT BIKES lashed in the bed, seen prominently as we pass. \nThe POV approaches a door.  Number 14. \nThe door is KICKED OPEN. Moving inside. The assault rifle sprays the room, exploding the indistinct forms on the bed.  Staccato glare.  Approaching the bed. Nothing there put the shredded remain of sheets and pillows. \nThe POV shifts to the BACK DOOR, which is ajar, and moves toward it.  Through the door.  Revealing an EMPTY YARD. \nCUT TO: \n215     INT. PICKUP TRUCK/PARKING LOT - NIGHT                  215 \nReese is under the dash, playing with the wires.
